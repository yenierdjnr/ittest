The certification covers the basic knowledge required of a junior level Linux administrator. Candidates are expected to be able to work competently across a wide array of environments and skill sets. Unlike many certifications, candidates who complete the Linux+ exams (LX0-101 and LX0-102) are awarded with not one, but two certifications: the CompTIA Linux+ certification and the LPI LPIC-1 certification. That makes this an excellent starting point for people interested in working with Linux as you gain essential base knowledge as well as fill out your resume.",

          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.900\n[MUSIC]\n\n2\n00:00:08.286 --> 00:00:08.950\nAll right.\n\n3\n00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:13.340\nToday we're gonna take a look at\nthe Linux+ certification from CompTIA.\n\n4\n00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:16.110\nThis is kind of an interesting\ncertification compared to\n\n5\n00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:17.940\na lot of the ones that CompTIA does,\n\n6\n00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.160\nbecause it's the first one that\nthey didn't actually develop.\n\n7\n00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.820\nAnd so that makes it interesting,\nso we do wanna talk about it.\n\n8\n00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.570\nKinda what it is, what it covers, and\nwhy CompTIA didn't develop this exam.\n\n9\n00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:31.270\nIt's all important stuff to know,\n\n10\n00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:35.170\nso let's just start with\nthe basics with what is Linux+?\n\n11\n00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:37.780\nIt's a certification from CompTIA,\n\n12\n00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:42.590\nthe same people that bring you A+,\nNet+, Security+, they bring you Linux+.\n\n13\n00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.770\nAnd it's designed to show that\na network or systems administrator\n\n14\n00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.760\nhas a basic level of knowledge in\noperating Linux servers and workstations.\n\n15\n00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.760\nIt's designed to be vendor neutral so\nit's not Red Hat only or\n\n16\n00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.670\nUbuntu canonical, whatever.\n\n17\n00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.690\nIt is design to be vendor neutral but\n\n18\n00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.660\nit does actually focus a little bit on\nthe Red Hat-based Linux products and\n\n19\n00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:08.080\nthe Debian-based Linux products,\nwhich almost everything is these days.\n\n20\n00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.635\nSo it does a great job of straddling\nthe fence between those and\n\n21\n00:01:11.635 --> 00:01:16.025\nshowing concepts, commands,\nadministration tools and\n\n22\n00:01:16.025 --> 00:01:20.980\ntechniques that apply to both sets of the\nLinux distributions that are out there.\n\n23\n00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:26.210\nSo it is a great certification in that it\ndoes show you have that general knowledge.\n\n24\n00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:27.180\nNow, in the beginning,\n\n25\n00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.250\nCompTIA actually had their own in-house\ndeveloped Linux+ certification.\n\n26\n00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.000\nBut over time,\nthey wanted to make it better and\n\n27\n00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.270\nmore generally accepted\namongst the community.\n\n28\n00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.150\nSo instead of continuing to\nwrite the exam themselves,\n\n29\n00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:44.810\nthey partnered with the LPI,\nthe Linux Professional Institute.\n\n30\n00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.850\nLPI actually had, or has, four levels\nof Linux certification available,\n\n31\n00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.780\nfrom basic all the way up to\nsuper mega expert, right?\n\n32\n00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.511\nYou have to wear suspenders and\nhave a beard for that one.\n\n33\n00:01:55.511 --> 00:01:57.265\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Even if you're a woman.\n\n34\n00:01:57.265 --> 00:02:02.260\n[LAUGH] And so you know they've\ngot some really advanced stuff and\n\n35\n00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.640\nCompTIA said well you know,\nwe really just want the lower end, right?\n\n36\n00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.025\nThe introductories,\npeople have the base knowledge,\n\n37\n00:02:08.025 --> 00:02:11.330\nit's the equivalent of one year of\nfield experience working with Linux.\n\n38\n00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.320\nThat's what they're shooting for\nand the LPI said well great.\n\n39\n00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:19.910\nWhat you can do is you can use our first\ntwo exams for our certification track and\n\n40\n00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.460\nuse that to gauge your Linux+ testers,\nright?\n\n41\n00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:25.910\nAnd so that's what they did,\nthey partnered up,\n\n42\n00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.880\nit's been a great partnership\nbetween the two organizations.\n\n43\n00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.850\nAnd so when you look at the CompTIA\nwebpages, it'll always say,\n\n44\n00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:33.859\nwell look I've got it\npulled up right here.\n\n45\n00:02:33.859 --> 00:02:38.612\nCompTIA Linux+ Powered by LPI, and\nthat lets you know that while it is\n\n46\n00:02:38.612 --> 00:02:43.580\na CompTIA certification,\nit's actually developed by the LPI.\n\n47\n00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:44.700\nOn a neat side,\n\n48\n00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.730\nit means when you pass the exams,\nyou actually get two certifications.\n\n49\n00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.360\nYou get the CompTIA Linux+ which\nis what most of us are after.\n\n50\n00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:58.120\nAnd then on the LPI,\nLinux Professional Institute, side,\n\n51\n00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.850\nyou'll see that you actually end up with\nwhat's called their LPIC-1 certification,\n\n52\n00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:05.160\nJunior Level Linux certification.\n\n53\n00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.640\nAnd to get that you have to\npass their first two exams\n\n54\n00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.330\nwhich are the same exams you\nhave to take for Linux+.\n\n55\n00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:14.200\nSo you actually end up double\ncertified which is just kind of neat.\n\n56\n00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.910\nNow, CompTIA does stop there at Linux+,\nthey don't go beyond that.\n\n57\n00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:22.670\nAnd so if you want to get\nmore advanced Linux skills,\n\n58\n00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.290\nwell that's where you come over to LPI and\nyou do LPIC-2, LPIC-3, right?\n\n59\n00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.150\nThat's how that partnership works, and how\nboth companies benefit from it and how you\n\n60\n00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:35.250\nbenefit from it too, because I'll tell\nyou a lot of people have heard of Linux+.\n\n61\n00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:40.339\nIt's a very popular certification, not\nas many people have heard of LPIC-2 and\n\n62\n00:03:40.339 --> 00:03:41.088\nLPIC-3.\n\n63\n00:03:41.088 --> 00:03:45.590\nThey're great certifications, believe me,\nbut not as many people have heard of them.\n\n64\n00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:48.430\nIf you want advanced certifications,\nthey're the way to go, right?\n\n65\n00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.080\nBut if you're just trying to do that\nentry-level thing, something that's higher\n\n66\n00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:54.000\nvisibility is great,\nlooks great on the resume, so here you go.\n\n67\n00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:59.140\nAll right, now the Linux+ certification\nis actually broken up into two exams.\n\n68\n00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:00.058\nSo, we have.\n\n69\n00:04:00.058 --> 00:04:01.797\nActually do they show it on this page?\n\n70\n00:04:01.797 --> 00:04:06.525\nThere it is, the LX0-101 and the LX0-102,\n\n71\n00:04:06.525 --> 00:04:10.030\ntwo different certification exams.\n\n72\n00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:15.195\nThey are a little bit on the pricey side,\nas most CompTIA exams have been lately,\n\n73\n00:04:15.195 --> 00:04:18.140\nthey've kind of raised\na bunch of their prices.\n\n74\n00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:21.140\nBut it's right around\n180 dollars per exam.\n\n75\n00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:24.095\nObviously, it varies based on your country\nbut it's right around in that area.\n\n76\n00:04:24.095 --> 00:04:29.248\nSo to take both of them you\nare looking at almost 400 dollars,\n\n77\n00:04:29.248 --> 00:04:34.180\nUS dollars, so it can be a little\nbit pricey, but it is two exams.\n\n78\n00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:38.370\n90 minutes each, so they're not incredibly\nlong, but you'll have 60 questions so\n\n79\n00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:41.190\nthat means you get about a minute and\na half per question and\n\n80\n00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:43.120\nyou don't wanna dabble too much.\n\n81\n00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.780\nThey are mostly multiple choice,\n\n82\n00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:48.750\nthere have been rumors of simulation\nquestions making it on the exams.\n\n83\n00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:53.550\nI haven't seen that yet but the rumor's\nout there, so it's mostly multiple choice,\n\n84\n00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:55.560\nand you can take it in\nseveral different languages.\n\n85\n00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:00.220\nLike all CompTIA exams,\nthey're administered through Pearson VUE.\n\n86\n00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:04.260\nSo you just find the local VUE\ntesting center that is near you.\n\n87\n00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:10.102\nIf you're not familiar with VUE,\ntheir website is pearsonvue, it's V-U-E,\n\n88\n00:05:10.102 --> 00:05:15.170\n.com and they have testing\nlocations all over the world.\n\n89\n00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:20.010\nSo you just come in here and you say,\ntest taker services, you're trying to take\n\n90\n00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:23.365\na test and you'll come in and pick what\nyou're trying to get certified in.\n\n91\n00:05:23.365 --> 00:05:29.485\nSo we can go to IT and\nfind old CompTIA in here, there we go.\n\n92\n00:05:29.485 --> 00:05:31.005\nAnd once we're in here.\n\n93\n00:05:31.005 --> 00:05:33.432\nNice, thank you for\ntelling me about your cookies.\n\n94\n00:05:33.432 --> 00:05:36.607\n[LAUGH] So you can come in here, and you\ncan kinda figure out what it is you want.\n\n95\n00:05:36.607 --> 00:05:39.227\nAnd you've got locate a test center, and\n\n96\n00:05:39.227 --> 00:05:43.207\nwe can find the test center that is\nnear us based on wherever it is you are.\n\n97\n00:05:43.207 --> 00:05:47.097\nSo maybe you are in Paris, France,\nso I'll just punch that in.\n\n98\n00:05:48.957 --> 00:05:55.477\nAnd looks like we got a couple there,\ndepending on which you are in.\n\n99\n00:05:55.477 --> 00:05:57.337\nSee, I'll show off my\nwitty Parisian knowledge.\n\n100\n00:05:57.337 --> 00:05:58.242\n>> That's nice, yes.\n\n101\n00:05:58.242 --> 00:06:00.170\nSo, anyhow you can see some\nof the different places\n\n102\n00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:01.330\nthat are available to test there.\n\n103\n00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:02.290\nAll over the world.\n\n104\n00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:05.464\nI think we have 2 of them here in our\ntown, and our town is a pretty small one.\n\n105\n00:06:05.464 --> 00:06:08.908\nSo you can go and take the test there,\nit's pretty low pressure, right?\n\n106\n00:06:08.908 --> 00:06:14.680\n60 questions, 90 minutes, multiple choice,\nit's not so bad if you know your stuff.\n\n107\n00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:17.215\nSo what is the stuff that we need to know?\n\n108\n00:06:17.215 --> 00:06:20.430\nWell the two exams\nare a little bit different.\n\n109\n00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:25.890\nWe've got the LX0-101,\nthat's the first exam, and\n\n110\n00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:30.250\nit covers what I consider to be\nthe introductory information.\n\n111\n00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:32.930\nNow if you've never\nworked with Linux before,\n\n112\n00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:34.670\nsome of this is pretty challenging.\n\n113\n00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:36.200\nBut if you've got experience with Linux,\n\n114\n00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:39.800\nif you've been running it on your desktop\nor as a server for years and years.\n\n115\n00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:44.370\nThis one's actually the easier of the two\nexams because it's covering things like\n\n116\n00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:46.660\nhow to get Linux installed.\n\n117\n00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:51.935\nSo, just installing it on a computer, how\nto get it updated to make sure that you're\n\n118\n00:06:51.935 --> 00:06:57.110\ndoing hot fixes and security updates, it's\ncovering basic command line exercises.\n\n119\n00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:59.250\nNow that's really important.\n\n120\n00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:03.000\nA lot of people say, well,\nI've been running Linux for five years and\n\n121\n00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.380\nI use Ubuntu and I love it, right?\n\n122\n00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:08.140\nAnd then I say okay how often do you drop\n\n123\n00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:10.550\nto the terminal shell to\nactually run command line?\n\n124\n00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:13.890\nAnd they go well never,\nI do it all through the GUI.\n\n125\n00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:16.340\nWell that's a recipe for disaster, right?\n\n126\n00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:18.640\nBecause the GUI differs so\n\n127\n00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:24.150\nmuch from distro to distro, it's hard\nto learn one way that works everywhere.\n\n128\n00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:27.305\nAnd if you're on a server you\nshouldn't have a GUI at all.\n\n129\n00:07:27.305 --> 00:07:32.750\nRight, so the exam is almost\nentirely based on command line.\n\n130\n00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:36.957\nCuz when you learn something that way,\nwhen you learn it command line style,\n\n131\n00:07:36.957 --> 00:07:39.442\nyou can use it on any\nGNU Linux distribution.\n\n132\n00:07:39.442 --> 00:07:44.850\nAnd so that really makes life easy,\nstandard, compliant, right?\n\n133\n00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:47.670\nSo if you've got a lot of graphical\nuser interface experience,\n\n134\n00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:50.700\nthat will help you a little bit on\nthe second exam, but on the first exam,\n\n135\n00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:52.780\nyou're gonna be dead in the water,\ncuz it's almost all command line.\n\n136\n00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:56.840\nSo we tackle that,\nthe GNU and Unix commands.\n\n137\n00:07:56.840 --> 00:08:00.490\nWe also take a look at how\nhardware devices are accessed,\n\n138\n00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:05.390\nhow the file systems work, and the file\nhierarchy, how the folders are arranged.\n\n139\n00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:08.190\nAnd again, if you've been\nworking with Unix or Linux for\n\n140\n00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:12.370\na while, then that's second\nnature by now more than likely.\n\n141\n00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:14.100\nBut, if you're brand new to this,\n\n142\n00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:17.690\nit's really different than a lot of other\noperating systems that are out there.\n\n143\n00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:20.970\nIf you've got a lot of Windows experience,\nthis stuff will blow your mind,\n\n144\n00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:22.690\nbecause it's really different,\n\n145\n00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:27.230\nthat hardware devices reference as files,\nnot as objects.\n\n146\n00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:30.621\nIf you're used to OSX and Mac OS,\n\n147\n00:08:30.621 --> 00:08:34.070\nMac OS is running on top of BSD so\nyou might think they're similar.\n\n148\n00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:38.610\nBut Apple is tweaked with that file system\nso much that directories and paths and\n\n149\n00:08:38.610 --> 00:08:42.250\nstuff are just not the same\nas we see in the Linux world.\n\n150\n00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:45.130\nSo getting used to this can be\na little challenging, right, so\n\n151\n00:08:45.130 --> 00:08:46.270\ndefinitely keep that in mind.\n\n152\n00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:50.030\nSo that's kind of what you\nexpect to see on the first exam.\n\n153\n00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:56.490\nNotice that the bulk of it, 43% of that\nexam, is from the command line, right.\n\n154\n00:08:56.490 --> 00:09:02.250\nGNU and Unix, or GNU, sometimes called\nNew, in Unix command line utility.\n\n155\n00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:05.120\nSo, you've really got to\nspend some time on that.\n\n156\n00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:09.750\nIf you are, [LAUGH] if you're\n30 plus years old and you cut\n\n157\n00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:14.650\nyour teeth on DOS and Windows 3.1, then\nit's not a big challenge to pick that up.\n\n158\n00:09:14.650 --> 00:09:19.940\nBut if you're 20 years old and just out\nof high school and you grew up with\n\n159\n00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:24.130\nWindows XP and stuff, you might not\nhave used the command line very much.\n\n160\n00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:27.389\nAnd even if you've been in\nthe Linux world for 10,\n\n161\n00:09:27.389 --> 00:09:30.990\n20 years, you might be GUI-heavy and\nnot command line-heavy.\n\n162\n00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:34.110\nSo, we do need to make sure we focus\nin on that and spend some time.\n\n163\n00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:36.480\nThat's what you're gonna\nsee on the first exam.\n\n164\n00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:38.920\nSo basic operational skills and really,\n\n165\n00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:43.120\neverything that you learn in this exam\nshould apply to any Linux distribution\n\n166\n00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:46.982\nthat you're running unless it's some\ncrazy completely whacked out one.\n\n167\n00:09:46.982 --> 00:09:49.269\n[LAUGH] But\nmost of them will work just like this.\n\n168\n00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:51.327\nAll right,\n\n169\n00:09:51.327 --> 00:09:55.270\nnow each of these topics are broken\ndown into quite a bit of sub topics.\n\n170\n00:09:55.270 --> 00:09:58.140\nYou'll see some of the different things\nthat it goes into and we'll go over all\n\n171\n00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:01.320\nthese during the actual show so I don't\nwant to bore us to death with them now.\n\n172\n00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:03.280\nBut lets take a look at that second exam.\n\n173\n00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:06.800\nThe other exam is the LX0-102,\n\n174\n00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:11.840\nthis guy right here, and it breaks\nthings down a little bit differently.\n\n175\n00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:15.860\nYou'll see where we tackle Shells,\nScripting and Data Management, all right?\n\n176\n00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:20.890\nIn my opinion, scripting is one of\nthe most useful things that you can learn,\n\n177\n00:10:20.890 --> 00:10:22.920\nbecause you don't wanna\nrun the same task over and\n\n178\n00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:26.300\nover again if you can automate it, and\nscripting is all about automating it.\n\n179\n00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:27.830\nSo we're gonna get\na chance to see that and\n\n180\n00:10:27.830 --> 00:10:30.770\nas an administrator that's something\nwe really do benefit from.\n\n181\n00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:35.340\nWe'll see user interfaces and desktops,\nwe're gonna talk about several of\n\n182\n00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:39.930\nthe different graphical user interfaces\navailable because you've got Gnome and\n\n183\n00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:44.665\nKDE, you've got Enlightenment,\nI think ten people run that.\n\n184\n00:10:44.665 --> 00:10:46.870\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Xfce, which is one of my favorites,\n\n185\n00:10:46.870 --> 00:10:49.940\nso there's several different user\ninterfaces that are out there,\n\n186\n00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:52.810\nwe'll take a look at each of them and\nsome of the ins and outs.\n\n187\n00:10:52.810 --> 00:10:57.565\nBut notice, user interfaces and\ndesktops, only 8%,\n\n188\n00:10:57.565 --> 00:11:02.665\nvery small part of that exam because\nit's just not standard between systems.\n\n189\n00:11:02.665 --> 00:11:06.435\nWe'll see general administrative tasks,\nthings like creating user accounts,\n\n190\n00:11:06.435 --> 00:11:09.600\nchanging file permissions,\nstuff like that.\n\n191\n00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:14.200\nEssential system services, we'll take a\nlook at web servers and e-mail servers and\n\n192\n00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:16.520\nsome of the things that we typically run.\n\n193\n00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:20.290\nWe'll definitely spend some time on SSH\ncuz that's such an important service and\n\n194\n00:11:20.290 --> 00:11:24.290\na few of the other services that we\nmay use as a part of running Linux.\n\n195\n00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:27.890\nWe've got networking fundamentals.\n\n196\n00:11:27.890 --> 00:11:31.800\nSo configuring our network adapter, some\nof the neat features we have in Linux,\n\n197\n00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:35.560\nIPv4 and IPv6 support,\nsome of the different things there.\n\n198\n00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:39.830\nAs well as NFS, the network file system,\nwe’ll cover it in there too.\n\n199\n00:11:39.830 --> 00:11:43.250\nAnd then lastly, security,\nit’s last but not least.\n\n200\n00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:46.370\nIn a very literal sense,\nsecurity is really important to us.\n\n201\n00:11:46.370 --> 00:11:50.710\nA lot of us are using Linux as a server\noperating system and in that scenario,\n\n202\n00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:53.970\nsecurity's really important so\nwe need to take a look at that.\n\n203\n00:11:53.970 --> 00:11:57.930\nWe're gonna take a look at configuring\nsoftware firewalls under Linux, as well as\n\n204\n00:11:57.930 --> 00:12:01.990\nother processes like just staying up to\ndate that are really, really important.\n\n205\n00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:05.730\nSo, the first exam is based on\n\n206\n00:12:05.730 --> 00:12:09.170\nfundamentals that every Linux\nadministrator should have.\n\n207\n00:12:09.170 --> 00:12:12.660\nThe second exam is based\nmore on practical skills,\n\n208\n00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:15.570\nthings we're gonna do on\nan ongoing day-to-day basis.\n\n209\n00:12:15.570 --> 00:12:19.160\nSo they're really two neat\nexams that individually don't\n\n210\n00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:24.118\nprovide you with a well-rounded\nenough basis for Linux knowledge, but\n\n211\n00:12:24.118 --> 00:12:29.110\ncombined, it is the best\nstarting point bar none, right.\n\n212\n00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:32.600\nIt just really is a great starting point\nfor somebody who's getting into Linux and\n\n213\n00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:33.820\nlearning it.\n\n214\n00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:38.820\nIf you have never studied or\nused or even installed Linux,\n\n215\n00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:41.760\nthis certification is still for you, or\nat least our show is for you, right.\n\n216\n00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:43.960\nThe certification, you're probably\nnot ready for that exam today.\n\n217\n00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:45.810\n>> Right.\n>> So it might not be for you today, but\n\n218\n00:12:45.810 --> 00:12:47.680\nour show is.\n\n219\n00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:51.370\nWe're gonna show you how to install Linux,\nhow to get the operating system, how to\n\n220\n00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:56.140\nget it installed and how to do the work\nwith it, and it's a very rewarding thing.\n\n221\n00:12:56.140 --> 00:13:00.000\nLearning a new operating system, it's fun,\njust fun to see things that are different.\n\n222\n00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.920\nNow you even if the operating system\n\n223\n00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:02.490\nsucks,\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n224\n00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:03.700\n>> It's still a lot of fun to learn\n\n225\n00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:04.630\nsomething new.\n\n226\n00:13:04.630 --> 00:13:07.112\nSo, not that the Linux distros do.\n\n227\n00:13:07.112 --> 00:13:09.085\n>> [LAUGH] [INAUDIBLE]\n>> Some of them do.\n\n228\n00:13:09.085 --> 00:13:12.760\n[LAUGH] Yeah, choosing your distribution,\nthat is a tough, tough choice.\n\n229\n00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:17.100\nYeah, that's basically\nwhat this works out to.\n\n230\n00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:19.390\nKeep in mind, that it is two exams.\n\n231\n00:13:19.390 --> 00:13:22.586\nNow, we're gonna record one big show or\nseries of episodes and\n\n232\n00:13:22.586 --> 00:13:25.070\nwe're gonna cover both of those exams,\nright?\n\n233\n00:13:25.070 --> 00:13:28.578\nSo, it's not gonna be two entries in\nour episode library, or anything but\n\n234\n00:13:28.578 --> 00:13:30.090\nit is all gonna be there.\n\n235\n00:13:30.090 --> 00:13:34.870\nIt's important that you know both,\nI encourage you to go ahead and study for\n\n236\n00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:37.400\nboth before you take the first exam.\n\n237\n00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:40.780\nSome people study just the stuff for\nthe first exam and then go take it.\n\n238\n00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:42.935\nBut as you study for the second exam,\n\n239\n00:13:42.935 --> 00:13:46.650\nyou're kind of reinforcing your knowledge\nthat you are gonna have on that first one.\n\n240\n00:13:46.650 --> 00:13:50.730\nAnd so if you do the whole thing, if you\nstudy for the whole thing, when you go to\n\n241\n00:13:50.730 --> 00:13:55.160\ntake that first exam you'll be that much\nmore prepared, and so I do recommend that.\n\n242\n00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:58.300\nBut again, that's entirely up to you,\nwhatever is your preference.\n\n243\n00:13:58.300 --> 00:13:58.880\n>> Yeah.\n\n244\n00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:00.020\nOur show should also help you,\n\n245\n00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:03.200\nin the very fact that what we'll be doing\nis we'll be installing it right away.\n\n246\n00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:06.040\nWe'll show you how you can get it running\non your machine, so that you can practice.\n\n247\n00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:09.400\nThe more hands on practice,\nlike anything that you do it's\n\n248\n00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:12.110\ngonna actually bring you better results\nand you're gonna learn it better.\n\n249\n00:14:12.110 --> 00:14:14.990\nSo make sure you pay attention and\nespecially in the early episodes as we set\n\n250\n00:14:14.990 --> 00:14:19.268\nthis thing up, and we get it rolling\nto the front when we need to.\n\n251\n00:14:19.268 --> 00:14:20.470\n>> Yeah.\n\n252\n00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:24.709\nAll right well as far as general stuff\nI think that pretty much knocks it out.\n\n253\n00:14:24.709 --> 00:14:28.866\nThere is one other thing I do wanna\nmention is that Linux+ like all\n\n254\n00:14:28.866 --> 00:14:33.200\nCompTIA certifications now, does use a.\n\n255\n00:14:34.270 --> 00:14:38.730\nNot expiration, but\ncontinuing education type environment.\n\n256\n00:14:38.730 --> 00:14:42.000\nSo you do after renew your\ncertification every two years, so\n\n257\n00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.950\nbe aware of that, that once you\nget certified, you're not done.\n\n258\n00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:47.700\nIf you wanna maintain you\nLinux+ certification,\n\n259\n00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:51.770\nyou've gotta recertify every two\nyears through continuing education.\n\n260\n00:14:51.770 --> 00:14:55.430\nSo normally, we just retake the exam and\nyou're back in business.\n\n261\n00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:57.130\nSo, keep that in mind too.\n\n262\n00:14:57.130 --> 00:14:59.540\nIf you're already Linux+ certified,\n\n263\n00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:03.190\nyou may have gotten in in the early\ndays when there was a lifetime cert.\n\n264\n00:15:03.190 --> 00:15:06.240\nIf not you do need to repeat that\ncertification as time goes on.\n\n265\n00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:11.020\nBut other than that I think\nthat pretty much covers it.\n\n266\n00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:14.750\nDefinitely stay tuned, we're gonna kick\noff the show if you're watching live,\n\n267\n00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:16.060\nwe'll kick it off later today.\n\n268\n00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:20.220\nSo you'll get a chance to see that\nwealth of great information there and\n\n269\n00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:23.270\nif you've never used Linux+ boy,\nyou're in for a treat.\n\n270\n00:15:23.270 --> 00:15:26.760\nOr if you've never used Linux you're in\nfor a treat because it's a neat operating\n\n271\n00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:29.660\nsystem that has some great\nuses that are out there.\n\n272\n00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:32.200\nAnd it's really an interesting\nculture to become a part of.\n\n273\n00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:33.670\n>> It is.\n\n274\n00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:35.230\n>> All right, well stay tuned.\n\n275\n00:15:35.230 --> 00:15:38.472\nWe'll be back with\nthe Linux+ show after this.\n\n276\n00:15:38.472 --> 00:15:44.679\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:39.500\ngood evening and welcome, not welcome\nback right, I gotta change my gears here.\n\n4\n00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.403\nWelcome to an episode.\n\n5\n00:00:41.403 --> 00:00:43.440\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Not another episode [LAUGH] of Linux+.\n\n6\n00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.690\nThat's right we are kicking\noff the Linux+ show.\n\n7\n00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.100\nAlways fun to kick off something new\naround here and I know we've had a number\n\n8\n00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:56.320\nof viewers out there waiting for us to\ndo Linux+, and well today is the day.\n\n9\n00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.020\nWell, today is the day if you're watching\nlive, if you're watching recorded then\n\n10\n00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:03.225\nsome other day in the past was the day,\nbut here we are, benefiting.\n\n11\n00:01:03.225 --> 00:01:06.350\n[LAUGH] All right,\nI'm going to stop trying to account for\n\n12\n00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.640\nall the different scenarios this\nvideo might be watched under.\n\n13\n00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.810\nBut we're going to be\nlaunching into Linux+.\n\n14\n00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.690\nIt's a great certification because it's a\ngreat way to show that you have some basic\n\n15\n00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:19.890\nknowledge, and got your feet wet in\nthe world of the Linux operating system.\n\n16\n00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.200\nSo we're gonna take a look at\ngetting it installed today,\n\n17\n00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.840\nwhich is kind of key if you want to learn\nit, you gotta get it installed first.\n\n18\n00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.060\nIt's so rare that you can buy a system\nthat has Linux preinstalled on it,\n\n19\n00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.990\nthat you're pretty much guaranteed to have\nto install it if you want to learn it.\n\n20\n00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.400\nSo we're gonna start out there and\nkinda work our way through.\n\n21\n00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.400\nBut before we get our hands dirty,\n\n22\n00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:44.060\nI wanna kind kind of jump back to\na little bit of a history lesson.\n\n23\n00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.840\nIt's useful to understand\nthe back story based around,\n\n24\n00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.130\nand Linux and how it's evolved,\nand how it's gone from there.\n\n25\n00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:53.570\nA lot of that is not on the exam but\n\n26\n00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.330\nit's useful, cuz it gives us that\nfoundational knowledge to then build upon.\n\n27\n00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:00.270\nSo first off, what the heck is Linux?\n\n28\n00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.860\nIf you just listen to me talk, and you're\nlike, what is this guy talking about?\n\n29\n00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:03.660\nWell.\n\n30\n00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:05.770\nLinux is an operating system.\n\n31\n00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.120\nWe used to call it\nan alternative operating system.\n\n32\n00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:11.020\nAnd that was a reference to\nthe fact that there's usually\n\n33\n00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:14.760\nsome number one operating\nsystem that's out there and\n\n34\n00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.420\nthis is something that has\na much smaller market share.\n\n35\n00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.691\nSo for example in today's market, if you\ngo into the business world, over 80% of\n\n36\n00:02:21.691 --> 00:02:26.780\nthe PCs are running Microsoft Windows or\na variant of Microsoft Window's.\n\n37\n00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.355\nThat doesn't mean that Windows\nis the best operating system,\n\n38\n00:02:29.355 --> 00:02:32.160\nit just means that's the one that's\nbeing the most commonly run and\n\n39\n00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.490\neverything else is\nan alternative operating system.\n\n40\n00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:39.030\nNow that changes from year to year, so\nwhile today Windows might be the biggest,\n\n41\n00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.260\nnext year it might be Mac OS,\nor who knows what.\n\n42\n00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.860\nBut Linux has been one that has been\naround for just about 20 years now,\n\n43\n00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.480\nI think maybe over 20 years, and has been\ngrowing in popularity, consistently,\n\n44\n00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.030\never since it came out originally.\n\n45\n00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.910\nSo whether or not it's gonna have it's\nday in the sun is yet to be seen, but\n\n46\n00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:02.630\nit's definitely picked up a huge\nportion of the server market share.\n\n47\n00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:05.270\nOn the works station side not so much,\n\n48\n00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:07.600\nthere's not many people running\nLinux on their work station.\n\n49\n00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.940\nYou'll find plenty of them out\nthere on the internet, but\n\n50\n00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.960\njust if you walked through an airport and\nwalk up to people who have their laptops\n\n51\n00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:18.300\nturned on, it's pretty rare that you\ncome across somebody running Linux.\n\n52\n00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.320\nWindows, Mac OS,\n\n53\n00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:24.910\nOSX whatever, you know those are a lot\nmore common, but Linux is out there.\n\n54\n00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:28.360\nIn the server world though,\nit's far more common.\n\n55\n00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.970\nThe majority of the web servers\nthat are out there on the internet,\n\n56\n00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.050\nI don't remember the exact statistics but\nit was something like 55% were\n\n57\n00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:37.710\nrunning Linux variants, you see\na lot of free BSD that's out there.\n\n58\n00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:40.650\nSo, you start to see a much\ndeeper penetration rate.\n\n59\n00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.800\nSo, where did Linux come from?\n\n60\n00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:48.507\nWell, back in the late 70s,\nearly 80s, you had AT&T's Bell Labs\n\n61\n00:03:48.507 --> 00:03:52.516\nback then that had created\nan operating system called UNIX.\n\n62\n00:03:52.516 --> 00:03:56.708\nAnd UNIX was designed to be a very\npowerful operating system that was very\n\n63\n00:03:56.708 --> 00:04:01.384\nprogrammer friendly which meant that if\nthe operating system didn't do what you\n\n64\n00:04:01.384 --> 00:04:05.945\nwanted it to you could manipulate it and\nyou can make it do what you want it to do.\n\n65\n00:04:05.945 --> 00:04:10.690\nIt was an operating system made\nby programmers for programmers.\n\n66\n00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:14.120\nUnlike Windows where it's a closed\noperating system that was made for\n\n67\n00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:19.220\nend users, and if you don't like something\nthat it does well, screw you you're stuck.\n\n68\n00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:23.160\n[LAUGH] And so you don't get that\nflexibility well that's how UNIX was.\n\n69\n00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.690\nBut units was very tightly controlled\nby AT&T, they had the license for\n\n70\n00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:29.380\nit, their people created it.\n\n71\n00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:33.290\nAnd so if you wanted to do\nit as a personal entity,\n\n72\n00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:37.210\nas a non corporate person UNIX\nwasn't really an option for you.\n\n73\n00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:42.300\nAnd so there were several people at\nthe time who tried to create UNIX like\n\n74\n00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:45.810\noperating systems, operating systems that\nwere very similar but not identical so\n\n75\n00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:47.320\nwe don't have the licensing problems.\n\n76\n00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:53.108\nOne of those products was\nan operating system called GNU Hurd,\n\n77\n00:04:53.108 --> 00:04:58.230\nH-U-R-D, or\nnew hurd depending on who you are.\n\n78\n00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:03.260\nGNU hurd was a excellent operating\nsystem that was, I shouldn't say\n\n79\n00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.080\nwas in development, technically it's still\nin development today although it's kind of\n\n80\n00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:11.210\ndead in the water, but it was designed\nto be that UNIX for the people.\n\n81\n00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:16.100\nSomething that anybody could run and not\nhave to pay exorbitant licensing to AT&T.\n\n82\n00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:18.710\nIt had some issues, it did not catch on.\n\n83\n00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:23.170\nOne that did catch on though was a little\noperating system, and I shouldn't even\n\n84\n00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:26.775\nsay that because really it's just a kernel\nthat was written by a gentleman named\n\n85\n00:05:26.775 --> 00:05:31.880\nLinus Torvalds and he created this\nkernel which is called the Linux kernel.\n\n86\n00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:35.970\nAnd it's a play on his name, Linus is\nhis name and Unix is what he was trying\n\n87\n00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:40.830\nto effectively emulate and so you have\nLinux, the combination of the two.\n\n88\n00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:44.490\nHe wrote a kernel which\nis a very small piece but\n\n89\n00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:47.950\nit's a very key piece\nof an operating system.\n\n90\n00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:52.010\nIf you think of the human body as\nan operating system, the heart is really\n\n91\n00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:56.220\nimportant, it's a very small part of the\nbody as a whole but it's very important.\n\n92\n00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:00.210\nWell that's how the kernel for\nLinux is, it's a very small part but\n\n93\n00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:03.100\nit's extremely important,\nit's what ties everything together and\n\n94\n00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:05.750\nwithout it the whole\nsystem would fall apart.\n\n95\n00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:10.570\nSo he created an open source\nkernel that anybody could use,\n\n96\n00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:15.780\nanybody could look at and take that,\nand do whatever they wanted with it.\n\n97\n00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:19.801\nAnd so people quickly fit it with all\nthe additional tools that were needed,\n\n98\n00:06:19.801 --> 00:06:25.800\nshell interpreters, command line\ninterfaces, command line utilities,\n\n99\n00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:29.520\nall of the GNU utilities that are out\nthere, all these other things that made it\n\n100\n00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:33.270\na fully functional,\nfully rounded operating system.\n\n101\n00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:37.800\nIn the early day's of Linux, which were\nin the early to mid 90s, 1992 to 1995,\n\n102\n00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:44.620\nthose were really the early days of Linux,\nit was a pretty sparse operating system.\n\n103\n00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:48.690\nI installed Linux for the first\ntime in 1995 which was definitely\n\n104\n00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:54.070\nin the early days of it, and there wasn't\na whole heck of a lot to it back then.\n\n105\n00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:59.640\nThe graphical user interface X11 that\nyou would lay on top of it was very,\n\n106\n00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:04.960\nvery, very limited, you had just\na handful of utilities and software.\n\n107\n00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:06.790\nIt was really designed for programmers.\n\n108\n00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:08.130\nIf you wanted to run this,\n\n109\n00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:10.630\nyou were the kind of the person that\nwas writing their own software.\n\n110\n00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:13.860\nSo you didn't care if Linux didn't have\nthe program you wanted because you were\n\n111\n00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:15.720\njust gonna write it yourself.\n\n112\n00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:17.840\nAnd for\npeople like that that were hobbyists,\n\n113\n00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:20.740\nthat were developers, it was perfect.\n\n114\n00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:24.380\nAnd those type of people were really\nattracted to the operating system and\n\n115\n00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:25.930\nthat's how it's grown.\n\n116\n00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:30.910\nIt stayed at a free and open source\nsoftware product for over 20 years.\n\n117\n00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:34.554\nThey've never charged for it,\nnow there are companies that do charge for\n\n118\n00:07:34.554 --> 00:07:36.729\nit, but they're not actually charging for\n\n119\n00:07:36.729 --> 00:07:40.231\nthe operating system itself they're\nusually charging for support.\n\n120\n00:07:40.231 --> 00:07:43.910\nYou cannot call Linus Torvalds on\nthe phone and ask for help, and\n\n121\n00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:46.581\nhalf the time if you email\nhim he cusses at you.\n\n122\n00:07:46.581 --> 00:07:50.539\n[LAUGH] He's not necessarily\nthe nicest guy on the planet, but\n\n123\n00:07:50.539 --> 00:07:51.841\nhe had a great idea.\n\n124\n00:07:51.841 --> 00:07:53.801\nHe's incredibly intelligent and\n\n125\n00:07:53.801 --> 00:07:56.914\nstill is very active in\nsupporting his product today.\n\n126\n00:07:56.914 --> 00:07:58.800\n>> Not many people can say that.\n\n127\n00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:00.490\nHe defiantly a great person.\n\n128\n00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:05.055\nIf you want help,\nyou're really on your own.\n\n129\n00:08:05.055 --> 00:08:08.586\nA programmer is typically on their own if\nthey're trying to come up with some new\n\n130\n00:08:08.586 --> 00:08:12.081\nway to do something it's a new way, no\nbody else has done it, there is no help.\n\n131\n00:08:12.081 --> 00:08:15.627\nSo there are companies out there\nthat will sell you support contacts,\n\n132\n00:08:15.627 --> 00:08:18.707\nRed Hat is probably the biggest one,\nNovell is another one.\n\n133\n00:08:18.707 --> 00:08:23.541\nOracle has gotten into the business now,\nwhere you can license Linux from them, or\n\n134\n00:08:23.541 --> 00:08:27.753\ntheir variant of it, and then do your\ninstall, and if you need support,\n\n135\n00:08:27.753 --> 00:08:30.260\nyou can call them on the phone and\nget help.\n\n136\n00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:34.780\nBut if you just want the OS, you can go\nout there and get it for free, and then\n\n137\n00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:38.860\nyou can install it, get it up and running\nin your environment, and not pay a dime.\n\n138\n00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:41.040\nDoesn't mean the operating\nsystem is truly free, though.\n\n139\n00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:43.070\nThere's always a cost of operation, right.\n\n140\n00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:44.590\nSupport costs and so on.\n\n141\n00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:48.710\nBut the OS itself is non-license so\nyou don't have to worry about that.\n\n142\n00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:49.871\nIt's kind of a nice thing.\n\n143\n00:08:49.871 --> 00:08:50.789\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n144\n00:08:50.789 --> 00:08:52.130\nSo Don, let me ask you this.\n\n145\n00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:55.450\nSo you have been using Linux for\nquite a while.\n\n146\n00:08:55.450 --> 00:08:58.300\nNow, so,\nWindows has gone through some changes.\n\n147\n00:08:58.300 --> 00:09:01.539\nFrom comparing Windows 8 to let's say,\nWindows 3.1.\n\n148\n00:09:01.539 --> 00:09:02.795\nRight?\n\n149\n00:09:02.795 --> 00:09:08.750\nSo, Linux today, from Linux from\nyesteryear does it seem a lot of change,\n\n150\n00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:11.880\nor is it at it's root\nstill about the same?\n\n151\n00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:15.180\n>> There's been changes,\nit is more stable,\n\n152\n00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:17.200\nand I don't mean stable as in crashing.\n\n153\n00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:20.820\nI mean just more stable as far as\nthe change that happen over the years.\n\n154\n00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:22.770\nUsually what happens in Windows,\n\n155\n00:09:23.890 --> 00:09:25.640\nis Microsoft decides they want\nto change something, right?\n\n156\n00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:27.500\nLet's use Windows 8 as an example.\n\n157\n00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:30.090\nWe want you to have this new,\nmodern user interface.\n\n158\n00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:34.350\nThis new crazy square touchscreen layout,\nall right?\n\n159\n00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:38.260\nAnd so they give it to you, and\nthey take away everything else.\n\n160\n00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.960\nThat's the only interface you have now,\nright?\n\n161\n00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:43.910\nYou're forced to use this new\ninterface cuz Microsoft said so.\n\n162\n00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:44.500\nRight.\n\n163\n00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:45.510\nOr Apple.\n\n164\n00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:46.950\nApple did the same thing where they said,\n\n165\n00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:51.390\nall right we're going to switch from power\nPCP processors, to Intel processors.\n\n166\n00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:55.070\nAnd you have one year that\nwe'll do support for both.\n\n167\n00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:55.680\nAnd then after that,\n\n168\n00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:59.460\nwe're going straight Intel,\nyour software needs to be rewritten.\n\n169\n00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:01.710\nThey force you to do it, okay.\n\n170\n00:10:01.710 --> 00:10:06.540\nIn the Linux world, as long as there's\none programmer somewhere that still\n\n171\n00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:09.730\nthinks that feature has value,\nthey'll continue to support it.\n\n172\n00:10:09.730 --> 00:10:13.790\nAnd so you can find Linux distos that\nsupport processors that I haven't\n\n173\n00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:17.970\neven seen in 15 years, but you'll still\nsee people writing software for that.\n\n174\n00:10:17.970 --> 00:10:22.850\nNow Sun Microsystems, they have the Sparc\nprocessors and Ultra Sparcs and all those.\n\n175\n00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:26.000\nThese are processors that I\nworked with 15 years ago.\n\n176\n00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.940\n17 years ago, a long time ago, definitely\nhaven't seen them in the last 10 years.\n\n177\n00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:34.060\nBut there are still active distributions\nout there that support those processes,\n\n178\n00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:35.100\nI have no idea why.\n\n179\n00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:40.520\nBut that's one of the advantages of\nhaving an open source product like that\n\n180\n00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:43.540\nis that there's not\na commercial entity who deems,\n\n181\n00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:46.230\nit’s not commercially viable\nto continue that feature.\n\n182\n00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:49.260\nBut as long as one person is out there\nwilling to write that support it\n\n183\n00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:50.640\nsticks around.\n\n184\n00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:54.400\nBut there have been big changes in the\n90s, we had a conversion of the way that\n\n185\n00:10:54.400 --> 00:11:00.040\nbinaries were written in Linux and so\nthey went to the ELF binary system.\n\n186\n00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:01.610\nDon't worry about that.\n\n187\n00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:03.740\nBut basically,\nevery program had to be recompiled.\n\n188\n00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:05.450\nAnd so that was a bit of a big deal.\n\n189\n00:11:06.610 --> 00:11:12.110\nNow we have this transition from 32-bit\nprocessors to 64-bit processors and\n\n190\n00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:13.780\n32 to 64-bit OSs.\n\n191\n00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:17.550\nAnd so again, we're seeing software get\nrecompiled same as you would in other OSs,\n\n192\n00:11:17.550 --> 00:11:18.770\nso very, very similar.\n\n193\n00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:22.317\nBecause of the open source\nnature of the software,\n\n194\n00:11:22.317 --> 00:11:24.081\nchanges are constantly happening.\n\n195\n00:11:24.081 --> 00:11:28.702\nYou have thousands, hundreds of thousands,\npossibly millions of developers that\n\n196\n00:11:28.702 --> 00:11:32.165\nare out there submitting changes\nto not just the Linux kernel.\n\n197\n00:11:32.165 --> 00:11:35.567\nBut all the different aspects\nof the operating system, and so\n\n198\n00:11:35.567 --> 00:11:39.480\nyou get tons of updates and\nchange in the system if you want that.\n\n199\n00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:40.370\nYou don't have to.\n\n200\n00:11:40.370 --> 00:11:41.750\nNone of it's forced upon you.\n\n201\n00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:42.590\nYou do have that selection.\n\n202\n00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:47.497\nThat's one of the big selling points of\nrunning an operating system like that.\n\n203\n00:11:47.497 --> 00:11:48.740\n>> Nice.\nYou just kinda pick and\n\n204\n00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:52.600\nchoose the pieces that you want, depending\non what it is you're wanting to run.\n\n205\n00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:56.630\nAnd just kind of tailor the OS to\nwhatever it is that you're wanting to do.\n\n206\n00:11:56.630 --> 00:11:59.830\n>> Yeah, yeah, it's all about\nflexibility with Linux, right?\n\n207\n00:11:59.830 --> 00:12:03.050\nAnd I hate to talk a bunch about\nMicrosoft on the Linux Plus show, but\n\n208\n00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:05.170\njust using them as the example.\n\n209\n00:12:05.170 --> 00:12:08.890\nFor years with Microsoft if you\nwanted to run Windows Server,\n\n210\n00:12:08.890 --> 00:12:11.780\nyou had to have the graphical\nuser interface.\n\n211\n00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:15.170\nEven today when they do the core install\nwhere they say it doesn't have a GUI,\n\n212\n00:12:15.170 --> 00:12:16.460\nit still has that GUI.\n\n213\n00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:21.430\nIt's still there, and it's eating up\nresources and exposing you to flaws.\n\n214\n00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:24.910\nIn Linux, if you don't want the GUI,\nyou just don't install it.\n\n215\n00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:26.960\nYou pick and\nchoose the components you want.\n\n216\n00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:28.190\nThat's really nice.\n\n217\n00:12:28.190 --> 00:12:30.620\nNow, about those components.\n\n218\n00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:32.520\nThere is a ton of components.\n\n219\n00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:35.600\nThere's multiple graphical user\ninterfaces that are out there.\n\n220\n00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:38.900\nThere are multiple Window managers\nthat change the way the things look.\n\n221\n00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:41.320\nThere's software packages for\nall sorts of stuff.\n\n222\n00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:42.497\nYou wanna run a web server?\n\n223\n00:12:42.497 --> 00:12:43.120\nGreat.\n\n224\n00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:44.570\nAll right.\nDo you want Apache?\n\n225\n00:12:44.570 --> 00:12:46.460\nIt's got it.\nDo you want websphere?\n\n226\n00:12:46.460 --> 00:12:47.050\nYou can get that.\n\n227\n00:12:47.050 --> 00:12:51.550\nThere's all sorts of different types\nof software that are available and\n\n228\n00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:54.920\ndifferent varieties of each type,\nso tons of selection.\n\n229\n00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:55.820\nAll right.\n\n230\n00:12:55.820 --> 00:12:59.497\nTo help you with that, there's a number\nof people who have created what\n\n231\n00:12:59.497 --> 00:13:01.290\nare called Linux distributions.\n\n232\n00:13:01.290 --> 00:13:05.472\nAnd a distribution is simply somebody\nwho took the Linux kernel and\n\n233\n00:13:05.472 --> 00:13:09.281\ncollected a bunch of other\nsoftware packages around them and\n\n234\n00:13:09.281 --> 00:13:13.331\nput them together to create\na fully featured operating system.\n\n235\n00:13:13.331 --> 00:13:14.330\nSo that you don't have to.\n\n236\n00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:15.250\nSo that you don't have to go and\n\n237\n00:13:15.250 --> 00:13:18.660\npick all that cuz we're talking\nthousands of different pieces.\n\n238\n00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:20.250\nYou don't have to go and\npick all that out.\n\n239\n00:13:20.250 --> 00:13:24.260\nThey've already pre-assembled it into\na distribution that you can install\n\n240\n00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:26.640\non your laptop or desktop,\nor on your server.\n\n241\n00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:31.587\nAnd it's got typically a generic set of\napplications that meet your needs and\n\n242\n00:13:31.587 --> 00:13:34.873\nthe core operating system\nfeatures that you need.\n\n243\n00:13:34.873 --> 00:13:35.747\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n244\n00:13:35.747 --> 00:13:38.140\nSo I want to ask you this then.\n\n245\n00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:39.630\nIn your opinion,\n\n246\n00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:44.650\ncomparing Linux to some of the other\noperating systems like Windows and OSX,\n\n247\n00:13:44.650 --> 00:13:49.620\nwhat kind of a learning curve do you\nthink it is to be able to pick it up and\n\n248\n00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:54.520\nto work with this and navigate it and\nI guess administer it in the end?\n\n249\n00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:56.760\n>> It's definitely\na steeper learning curve.\n\n250\n00:13:56.760 --> 00:14:01.350\nThe main reason is, when you're\nlearning computers the first time,\n\n251\n00:14:01.350 --> 00:14:03.080\nif you're trying to learn Windows?\n\n252\n00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:05.180\nYou've got other people around\nyou that are using Windows.\n\n253\n00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:07.456\nYou've go people you can reach out to for\nhelp.\n\n254\n00:14:07.456 --> 00:14:12.109\nIf you just bought a Mac, you've got other\npeople that have a Mac also that you can\n\n255\n00:14:12.109 --> 00:14:16.706\nreach out to or you can call the genus and\ntalk to a snot that walks there.\n\n256\n00:14:16.706 --> 00:14:19.910\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You can reach out and get that help.\n\n257\n00:14:19.910 --> 00:14:23.270\nBut, when you're running Linux, you might\nnot know anybody else running Linux.\n\n258\n00:14:23.270 --> 00:14:25.640\nYou end up in this much smaller community,\nbut\n\n259\n00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:27.910\nit's a very highly technical community.\n\n260\n00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:30.230\nSo if you go online,\nyou go into the forums,\n\n261\n00:14:30.230 --> 00:14:33.300\nyou go into those places you'll find\na lot of people who are willing to help.\n\n262\n00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:36.760\nYou'll find a lot of rude people but you\nknow the intermixed inside of them you'll\n\n263\n00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:41.000\nfind people that are willing to help and\nthey are extremely intelligent, right.\n\n264\n00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:46.720\nBecause unlike Windows where anybody,\nregardless of computer skill can go\n\n265\n00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:52.430\ndown to Best Buy and buy a laptop desktop\nfor $200 that's running Windows, right?\n\n266\n00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:54.230\nLinux isn't quite like that.\n\n267\n00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:57.920\nYou're not gonna get somebody without\na small degree of technical skill\n\n268\n00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:01.400\nrunning Linux, cuz you've gotta get\nit installed and get it up and going.\n\n269\n00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:04.213\nThere are people that sell netbooks and\nstuff, that have it pre-installed, but\n\n270\n00:15:04.213 --> 00:15:04.997\nit's very uncommon.\n\n271\n00:15:04.997 --> 00:15:09.903\nYour average Linux user, and not trying to\nsnotty or anything, but your average Linux\n\n272\n00:15:09.903 --> 00:15:13.642\nuser is more, not necessarily more\nintelligent, but more technically\n\n273\n00:15:13.642 --> 00:15:18.207\ntalented, skilled, knowledgable whatever,\nthan your average Windows or Mac user.\n\n274\n00:15:18.207 --> 00:15:20.581\nJust because you have to be\nto get the thing running.\n\n275\n00:15:20.581 --> 00:15:25.390\n[LAUGH] So, that is one of the things\nthat you need to be aware of.\n\n276\n00:15:25.390 --> 00:15:27.620\nNow, I'll tell you that personally,\n\n277\n00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:31.530\nI don't normally run Linux on a desktop or\na laptop.\n\n278\n00:15:31.530 --> 00:15:35.673\nYou'll find that Linux hardware support\ncan be a little flaky on some systems.\n\n279\n00:15:35.673 --> 00:15:39.718\nAnd that's because if you're Dell,\nif you're HP, if you're Toshiba,\n\n280\n00:15:39.718 --> 00:15:44.213\nif you're Asus, you're one of those\ncompanies that's manufacturing laptops,\n\n281\n00:15:44.213 --> 00:15:47.438\nyou're going to cater to\nthe largest common denominator.\n\n282\n00:15:47.438 --> 00:15:51.317\nIf 80% of your customers want Windows,\nthen you need to make\n\n283\n00:15:51.317 --> 00:15:55.870\nthose people happy because only\n20% of your customers want Linux.\n\n284\n00:15:55.870 --> 00:15:58.150\nOr URLSX or whatever.\n\n285\n00:15:58.150 --> 00:15:59.435\nSo, that's what they do.\n\n286\n00:15:59.435 --> 00:16:03.770\nAnd when it comes to hardware drivers,\nvideo cards are a great example.\n\n287\n00:16:03.770 --> 00:16:08.450\nNvidia, ATI, those guys,\nwell, ATI is now AMD, right?\n\n288\n00:16:08.450 --> 00:16:12.490\nSo, AMD, Nvidia,\nthose guys When they write their drivers,\n\n289\n00:16:12.490 --> 00:16:17.265\nthey focus on Windows first cuz it's\nthe most common for desktop OSs, right?\n\n290\n00:16:17.265 --> 00:16:20.892\nThen they come and usually create a nice\nlittle buggy one for Linux, or whatever.\n\n291\n00:16:20.892 --> 00:16:22.395\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, it's somewhat of an afterthought.\n\n292\n00:16:22.395 --> 00:16:23.385\nSo, on the desktop,\n\n293\n00:16:23.385 --> 00:16:27.435\nthat's the main reason why you don't see\njust great adoption on the desktop side.\n\n294\n00:16:27.435 --> 00:16:28.605\nYou can do it, right?\n\n295\n00:16:28.605 --> 00:16:30.510\nAnd I've done it, lots of people do it.\n\n296\n00:16:30.510 --> 00:16:34.260\nYou can run Linux as your day to day\noperating system on your desktop fine.\n\n297\n00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:35.010\nRight?\n\n298\n00:16:35.010 --> 00:16:37.680\nBut it may not have the same level\nof support as what you expect\n\n299\n00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:39.630\nwhen you're running a mainstream OS.\n\n300\n00:16:39.630 --> 00:16:42.040\nWell, I hate that term mainstream because,\n\n301\n00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:46.760\nwhile on the desktop Linux is not\nreally mainstream, on the server it is.\n\n302\n00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:48.400\nWhen it comes to servers,\n\n303\n00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:54.490\nI'm as often likely to run a Linux server\nas I am a Windows server or anything else.\n\n304\n00:16:54.490 --> 00:16:56.570\nAnd that's because the support for\n\n305\n00:16:56.570 --> 00:16:59.190\nhardware on the server\nside is much greater.\n\n306\n00:16:59.190 --> 00:17:01.920\nAnd you'll see companies like Dell,\nand HP and Toshiba,\n\n307\n00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:05.170\nthese Windows houses, where,\nwhen they create those servers they say,\n\n308\n00:17:05.170 --> 00:17:08.174\nyou know what,\n55% of our customers want Linux.\n\n309\n00:17:08.174 --> 00:17:09.460\nThat's more than Windows.\n\n310\n00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:11.370\nWe'll take the time to make\nsure these drivers work,\n\n311\n00:17:11.370 --> 00:17:13.470\nthe hardware supporters there.\n\n312\n00:17:13.470 --> 00:17:15.267\nAnd you don't have 3D video cards for\nit, but\n\n313\n00:17:15.267 --> 00:17:16.770\nyou don't use that on a server anyway,\nright?\n\n314\n00:17:16.770 --> 00:17:21.770\nAnd you end up with these\nphenomenally high performing servers\n\n315\n00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:26.570\nthat are great web servers, great file\nservers, directory servers, email servers,\n\n316\n00:17:26.570 --> 00:17:29.460\nthe stuff that makes the web work, right?\n\n317\n00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:32.120\nThe stuff that makes the Internet\nwhat the Internet is.\n\n318\n00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:34.480\nThe majority of that is\npowered on Linux systems.\n\n319\n00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:36.830\nAnd so,\nthat's really a great place to see it.\n\n320\n00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:40.710\nBut for the Linux Plus certification,\n\n321\n00:17:40.710 --> 00:17:43.870\nwe're not really drawing the line\nbetween servers and desktops.\n\n322\n00:17:43.870 --> 00:17:47.840\nEverything that we're gonna cover\nthroughout this show works on both.\n\n323\n00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:50.190\nSo, if you wanna do this on your desktop,\ngreat.\n\n324\n00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:53.670\nThere is no better way to learn Linux\nthan to just immerse yourself in it.\n\n325\n00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:55.380\nRun it every day, right?\n\n326\n00:17:55.380 --> 00:18:00.070\nMy only word of caution to you is don't\nlet yourself be coddled by some of\n\n327\n00:18:00.070 --> 00:18:05.570\nthe distributions that are out there that\nare designed to be super simplistic, okay?\n\n328\n00:18:05.570 --> 00:18:09.130\nBecause you could install\na distribution like Ubuntu, all right?\n\n329\n00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:13.690\nYou can install that right now, and you\nwould have a beautiful user interface and\n\n330\n00:18:13.690 --> 00:18:16.100\nalmost universal hardware support, and\n\n331\n00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:19.266\nthe system will just work to\nsteal Apple's slogan, right?\n\n332\n00:18:19.266 --> 00:18:20.520\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's like magic.\n\n333\n00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:24.520\nSo, your Ubuntu system will come up and\nit'll work wonderful.\n\n334\n00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:26.980\nAnd you can install Chrome, and\nthen you're browsing the Internet,\n\n335\n00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:27.580\nchecking your email.\n\n336\n00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:28.300\nAnd all of a sudden you say,\n\n337\n00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:31.770\nyou know what, I'm a Linux user,\nI'm hardcore, right?\n\n338\n00:18:31.770 --> 00:18:33.160\nI'm running Linux.\n\n339\n00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:38.980\nBut because everything was made so simple,\nyou never had to go to the command shell.\n\n340\n00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:41.280\nYou never had to load alternate drivers.\n\n341\n00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:43.630\nYou never had to compile your own kernel.\n\n342\n00:18:43.630 --> 00:18:47.600\nYou never had to do all that\nstuff that happens in real life,\n\n343\n00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:49.460\nthat happens when you're\nbuilding your own server.\n\n344\n00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:51.730\nAnd so,\nyou kinda lose that learning experience.\n\n345\n00:18:51.730 --> 00:18:53.330\nSo, don't do that.\n\n346\n00:18:53.330 --> 00:18:58.480\nIf you do, try and\ndo as much as you can from the shell.\n\n347\n00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:01.120\nDrop to that terminal prompt,\nthat command line interface, and\n\n348\n00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:04.580\ndo as much as you can from there,\nbecause the more you do it,\n\n349\n00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:08.450\nthe more you're able to retain it,\nto learn it.\n\n350\n00:19:08.450 --> 00:19:09.880\nI was somewhat fortunate because,\n\n351\n00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:13.940\nwhen I got started, I didn't have\nthe Graphical User Interface.\n\n352\n00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:17.820\nI didn't have a mouse on my computer, so\nusing the command line was what I used.\n\n353\n00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:21.540\nAnd that really kinda forced me to do it.\n\n354\n00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:26.180\nIf I were to do it all over again starting\ntoday, maybe if I were 16 years old in\n\n355\n00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:29.620\nhigh school right now, and\nI go to install Linux, I might say,\n\n356\n00:19:29.620 --> 00:19:32.690\nwhy bother with a command shell,\nI can do it all through a GUI.\n\n357\n00:19:32.690 --> 00:19:36.590\nBut one thing that is\nimportant to understand\n\n358\n00:19:36.590 --> 00:19:39.460\nis that each of the different\ndistributions that are out there,\n\n359\n00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:42.220\nthey package different\nuser interfaces with them.\n\n360\n00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:45.470\nAnd so, there are things that\nare different from distro to distro.\n\n361\n00:19:45.470 --> 00:19:49.750\nBut if you learn that command line, that's\nthe same across all of them, well, for\n\n362\n00:19:49.750 --> 00:19:50.620\nthe most part.\n\n363\n00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:55.430\nAnd so, you really get a much more\nmore useful base of knowledge.\n\n364\n00:19:55.430 --> 00:19:59.530\n>> So, wait, so, Don, you've used\na computer without a mouse, at all?\n\n365\n00:19:59.530 --> 00:20:01.060\n>> Yeah.\n>> You can navigate it, and\n\n366\n00:20:01.060 --> 00:20:03.000\ndo things without a mouse?\n\n367\n00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.090\n>> You've seen me, and\nthe amount of keyboard trinkets I use.\n\n368\n00:20:05.090 --> 00:20:07.170\nBut there was a time, Nate,\n\n369\n00:20:07.170 --> 00:20:10.155\nwhen computers didn't have hard drives\n>> And\n\n370\n00:20:10.155 --> 00:20:15.230\n[LAUGH] some of us used them then,\nand that was, yeah.\n\n371\n00:20:15.230 --> 00:20:19.630\nSo, it was-\n>> It was a different time back then.\n\n372\n00:20:19.630 --> 00:20:21.130\n>> It was a different time, yeah.\n\n373\n00:20:21.130 --> 00:20:26.830\nI had an IBM PC junior which was a,\nwas an 8088, I think, or was it an 8286?\n\n374\n00:20:26.830 --> 00:20:28.320\nShoot, I don't remember.\n\n375\n00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:31.310\nAnyhow, it was an older processor,\nand no mouse.\n\n376\n00:20:31.310 --> 00:20:32.770\nSo, I had no hard drive.\n\n377\n00:20:32.770 --> 00:20:35.790\nHad two five and\na quarter inch floppy disks,\n\n378\n00:20:35.790 --> 00:20:39.140\nand that was my first real computer.\n\n379\n00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:39.710\n>> Right?\n\n380\n00:20:39.710 --> 00:20:41.880\n>> So, it was not a great computer.\n\n381\n00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:43.510\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But it was enough to learn on.\n\n382\n00:20:43.510 --> 00:20:48.060\nSo, and that's something also\nworth mentioning about Linux,\n\n383\n00:20:48.060 --> 00:20:51.573\nis I said as long as there's one developer\nout there who wants to support something\n\n384\n00:20:51.573 --> 00:20:55.180\nand sticks around, Linux,\nbecause you control the features,\n\n385\n00:20:55.180 --> 00:20:59.090\nit actually runs great on old hardware and\nit runs great on new hardware.\n\n386\n00:20:59.090 --> 00:21:02.710\nIt's not like with Microsoft, where their\nstuff will run great on new hardware, and\n\n387\n00:21:02.710 --> 00:21:05.050\non old hardware it starts\nto get a little flaky.\n\n388\n00:21:05.050 --> 00:21:08.150\nYou can still take a 486 machine, and\n\n389\n00:21:08.150 --> 00:21:10.610\nas long as whatever distribution\nyou have is still compiling for\n\n390\n00:21:10.610 --> 00:21:14.740\nthe older processors, you can throw\nthe data on there and it'll run fine.\n\n391\n00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:18.430\nSure, it probably won't run\nthe 3D enhanced user interfaces.\n\n392\n00:21:18.430 --> 00:21:21.182\nBut if you're just setting up\na web server, it'll run it,\n\n393\n00:21:21.182 --> 00:21:22.621\nit'll turn right through it.\n\n394\n00:21:22.621 --> 00:21:25.890\nYou're setting up a doom server or\nwhatever, [LAUGH] it'll do just fine.\n\n395\n00:21:25.890 --> 00:21:28.260\nSo, keep that in mind.\n\n396\n00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:31.901\n>> Well, yeah, not only old hardware,\nbut some, in, actually,\n\n397\n00:21:31.901 --> 00:21:34.100\na lot of the embedded devices, right?\n\n398\n00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:37.630\nIt's like Raspberry Pi's,\nthey run distributions of Linux.\n\n399\n00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:41.950\nAnd other, these really small computers\nthat just kinda do one thing or\n\n400\n00:21:41.950 --> 00:21:46.720\njust very few things, just log data\nfrom sensors and those sort of things.\n\n401\n00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:51.290\nHave a stripped down, specialized\nversion of Linux running on those guys.\n\n402\n00:21:51.290 --> 00:21:53.580\n>> Yeah, and\nthe reason developers do that is, hey,\n\n403\n00:21:53.580 --> 00:21:55.850\nwe're creating a low cost board, right?\n\n404\n00:21:55.850 --> 00:21:57.540\nHow much is a Raspberry Pi?\n\n405\n00:21:57.540 --> 00:21:58.440\n>> 35 bucks.\n>> 35 bucks.\n\n406\n00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:02.040\nIf they were to put\nembedded Windows on there,\n\n407\n00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:05.420\nthe software license alone would\ncost more than the hardware, right?\n\n408\n00:22:05.420 --> 00:22:08.330\nAnd then, they wouldn't have any of\nthe customization available like you do\n\n409\n00:22:08.330 --> 00:22:09.160\nwith Linux.\n\n410\n00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:12.250\nBut instead, they can get Linux, and\nif they want to run custom hardware or\n\n411\n00:22:12.250 --> 00:22:14.760\nwhatever, they can write their own driver,\nthey customize it as they need.\n\n412\n00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:18.710\nThey can create something that's ultra\noptimized for their hardware and\n\n413\n00:22:18.710 --> 00:22:19.720\noff they go.\n\n414\n00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:24.650\nVersus, if you wanna go Windows, you gotta\nhave an Intel processor or an AMD, right?\n\n415\n00:22:24.650 --> 00:22:26.840\nAnd maybe an Intel Itanium.\n\n416\n00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:28.880\nI think that's the third\narchitecture they support.\n\n417\n00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:31.310\nBut on Linux you have 15 different\nprocessors you can pick from,\n\n418\n00:22:31.310 --> 00:22:32.190\ndifferent types.\n\n419\n00:22:32.190 --> 00:22:35.175\nSo, just the ultimate in options there.\n\n420\n00:22:35.175 --> 00:22:36.418\n>> Yeah.\n\n421\n00:22:36.418 --> 00:22:37.144\n>> All right.\n\n422\n00:22:37.144 --> 00:22:39.970\nNow, I do wanna do a little\nbit more of a history lesson.\n\n423\n00:22:39.970 --> 00:22:41.710\nI don't wanna bog you guys\ndown too much with history,\n\n424\n00:22:41.710 --> 00:22:43.940\nbecause that's not what's on the exam.\n\n425\n00:22:43.940 --> 00:22:47.260\nBut I've mentioned distributions,\nand this is one of the most common\n\n426\n00:22:47.260 --> 00:22:51.110\nquestions I get from viewers is,\nhey, Don, I wanna learn Linux.\n\n427\n00:22:51.110 --> 00:22:53.210\nWhich distribution do you recommend?\n\n428\n00:22:53.210 --> 00:22:55.270\nAnd there's a bunch of them out there.\n\n429\n00:22:55.270 --> 00:22:59.760\nThere are literally hundreds of\ndistributions, hundreds of people or\n\n430\n00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:03.130\ncompanies that decided they\nwanted to build the perfect\n\n431\n00:23:03.130 --> 00:23:04.960\nLinux distribution for you.\n\n432\n00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:08.840\nSo, they gathered the kernel, and then\nthey gathered all sorts of other software\n\n433\n00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:11.980\nselections together to create\nwhat they viewed as perfect.\n\n434\n00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:15.090\nWell, everybody's vision\nof perfect is different.\n\n435\n00:23:15.090 --> 00:23:17.540\nAnd so, when you go to pick\na distribution, it's a matter of finding,\n\n436\n00:23:17.540 --> 00:23:20.060\nI normally look for two things, right?\n\n437\n00:23:20.060 --> 00:23:23.482\nOne, that they have common\ngoals with what I want, right?\n\n438\n00:23:23.482 --> 00:23:25.390\nSo, I have needs.\n\n439\n00:23:25.390 --> 00:23:26.760\nAre their needs the same as mine?\n\n440\n00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:27.530\nDo they match, right?\n\n441\n00:23:27.530 --> 00:23:31.290\nAnd then, the second thing is\nare they gonna be around a while?\n\n442\n00:23:31.290 --> 00:23:34.154\nBecause a lot of distributions come and\ngo, right?\n\n443\n00:23:34.154 --> 00:23:40.258\nApple has been around with Mac OS for\n30 years now, right, maybe longer.\n\n444\n00:23:40.258 --> 00:23:43.551\nWindows, Microsoft with Windows,\nhas been around for 30 years now.\n\n445\n00:23:43.551 --> 00:23:45.175\nThey've been around a long time.\n\n446\n00:23:45.175 --> 00:23:46.395\nNovell NetWare.\n\n447\n00:23:46.395 --> 00:23:49.961\nNovell had been around with NetWare for\nover 20 years before finally,\n\n448\n00:23:49.961 --> 00:23:51.720\nbasically converting it to Linux.\n\n449\n00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:54.470\nSo it effectively, it's old form died.\n\n450\n00:23:54.470 --> 00:23:55.910\nSo that happens.\n\n451\n00:23:55.910 --> 00:23:59.470\nNo matter how big you are,\neventually, your product can die out.\n\n452\n00:23:59.470 --> 00:24:03.060\nBecause anybody can start a Linux\ndistribution, and because the software is\n\n453\n00:24:03.060 --> 00:24:07.340\nfree, it's more common in the Linux\nworld that distribution comes and goes.\n\n454\n00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:10.060\nSo one that might have been\nreally popular five years ago\n\n455\n00:24:10.060 --> 00:24:12.060\nmight be completely dead today.\n\n456\n00:24:12.060 --> 00:24:13.760\nSo that's the second\nthing that I look for.\n\n457\n00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:17.530\nSo thing number one was do they\nhave common goals with me?\n\n458\n00:24:17.530 --> 00:24:20.350\nAnd thing number two,\nhave they been around a while?\n\n459\n00:24:20.350 --> 00:24:21.600\nAre they going to be around a while?\n\n460\n00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:22.560\nWhat kind of funding do they have?\n\n461\n00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:25.505\nBecause I don't want to deploy something\nin production that I know is not going to\n\n462\n00:24:25.505 --> 00:24:28.105\nbe around next year, or that I'm not\ngonna be able to get updates for.\n\n463\n00:24:28.105 --> 00:24:29.480\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n464\n00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:33.390\n>> All right, now,\nthere is a website called the Futurist and\n\n465\n00:24:33.390 --> 00:24:34.365\nI've got it pulled up here.\n\n466\n00:24:34.365 --> 00:24:40.477\nFuturist.se and they create\nthe GNU/Linux distribution timeline.\n\n467\n00:24:40.477 --> 00:24:44.886\nAnd they created this awesome map\nof all the distributions that they\n\n468\n00:24:44.886 --> 00:24:47.141\nare aware of that are GNU-based.\n\n469\n00:24:47.141 --> 00:24:51.850\nAnd they kinda show when they started and\nhow they branched out from each other.\n\n470\n00:24:51.850 --> 00:24:55.090\nBecause a lot of people won't\ncreate a distribution from scratch.\n\n471\n00:24:55.090 --> 00:24:57.220\nInstead they'll pick one\nof the bigger ones, and\n\n472\n00:24:57.220 --> 00:24:59.150\nthey'll do what's called\nforking the distribution.\n\n473\n00:24:59.150 --> 00:25:00.890\nThey'll split off from\nthat development tree and\n\n474\n00:25:00.890 --> 00:25:03.590\ncreate their own variation based on that.\n\n475\n00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:07.040\nAll right, and they map them out,\nand this thing is amazing.\n\n476\n00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:09.090\nLet me just zoom in on this.\n\n477\n00:25:09.090 --> 00:25:11.880\nIt's a big image, so\nit'll take a minute to load.\n\n478\n00:25:14.130 --> 00:25:17.600\nSo, this is the part where\nit normally zooms in.\n\n479\n00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:18.360\nThere we, whoa.\n\n480\n00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:19.449\n>> Yes.\n>> All right,\n\n481\n00:25:19.449 --> 00:25:22.493\nthat might be a little too much,\nso, all right.\n\n482\n00:25:22.493 --> 00:25:27.284\nSo basically what they've done is they've\ncreated this family tree that shows\n\n483\n00:25:27.284 --> 00:25:31.580\nall the Linux distributions out there and\nwhen they came out.\n\n484\n00:25:31.580 --> 00:25:35.474\nAnd where they came from, so like the very\nfirst one on the list here is LibraNet,\n\n485\n00:25:35.474 --> 00:25:37.326\nwhich came out at the end of 1999.\n\n486\n00:25:37.326 --> 00:25:39.768\nAll right, so\nthere's that distribution and\n\n487\n00:25:39.768 --> 00:25:42.968\nI can follow the line forward\nto see that it died in 2005.\n\n488\n00:25:42.968 --> 00:25:43.873\nI shouldn't say it died.\n\n489\n00:25:43.873 --> 00:25:47.054\nIt stopped active development in 2005.\n\n490\n00:25:47.054 --> 00:25:51.019\nAll right, so, if you had been\nrunning LibraNet at the end of 2005,\n\n491\n00:25:51.019 --> 00:25:53.410\nyou had to switch to somebody else.\n\n492\n00:25:53.410 --> 00:25:56.140\nAll right, and you'll see,\nthey didn't start from scratch either.\n\n493\n00:25:56.140 --> 00:25:57.590\nIf you follow the line backwards,\n\n494\n00:25:57.590 --> 00:26:02.520\nyou'll see that they branched off of\nanother distribution called Debian.\n\n495\n00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:05.250\nAnd if you look at the picture as a whole,\n\n496\n00:26:05.250 --> 00:26:10.670\nlook at how many other people\nsplit off from Debian, all right.\n\n497\n00:26:10.670 --> 00:26:14.930\nIn the Linux world,\nwhile there are hundreds of distributions,\n\n498\n00:26:14.930 --> 00:26:18.760\nthere's really only three\nthat serve as the core,\n\n499\n00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:22.530\nthe original distros that are feeding\nall these other guys, all right.\n\n500\n00:26:22.530 --> 00:26:26.900\nSo all these other distributions that\nbleed off of Debian, what they do is they\n\n501\n00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:30.370\ntake the core OS, all the updates and\nstuff that gets written in Debian.\n\n502\n00:26:30.370 --> 00:26:33.970\nAnd then they just modify it to\nsuit their needs, their goals,\n\n503\n00:26:33.970 --> 00:26:37.180\nwhich might be different than\nthe original Debian product, all right.\n\n504\n00:26:37.180 --> 00:26:38.170\nThey make it better.\n\n505\n00:26:38.170 --> 00:26:42.685\nAnd if they create something that's really\ngood, so, if an update happens at Debain,\n\n506\n00:26:42.685 --> 00:26:44.160\nit's set to go downstream.\n\n507\n00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:47.040\nThe update goes down,\nto all these guys down here.\n\n508\n00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:49.050\nAnd they can take it and\nthey can benefit from it.\n\n509\n00:26:49.050 --> 00:26:53.320\nIf one of these guys writes something\nreally good, they then send it upstream.\n\n510\n00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:56.071\nUp to that provider so\nthey send it up to Debian.\n\n511\n00:26:56.071 --> 00:26:58.497\nThey say, hey we did this,\nand it's pretty awesome.\n\n512\n00:26:58.497 --> 00:27:01.090\nYou might want to consider\nputting that in the core OS.\n\n513\n00:27:01.090 --> 00:27:05.400\nAnd the guys at Debian,\nthe committee they have, it's a democracy.\n\n514\n00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:08.760\nAnd they take a look at it,\nthey vote on it, and decide whether or\n\n515\n00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:10.780\nnot they wanna put it in, all right?\n\n516\n00:27:10.780 --> 00:27:16.520\nSo it's really a symbiotic relationship\nbetween the base distributions and\n\n517\n00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:20.175\nall the little fringe ones that\ncome off of it, all right?\n\n518\n00:27:20.175 --> 00:27:24.130\nDebian is the most popular Linux\ndistribution that's out there,\n\n519\n00:27:24.130 --> 00:27:26.190\nespecially the free and open source ones.\n\n520\n00:27:26.190 --> 00:27:30.120\nAnd it's also created the most\nsub-distributions, right?\n\n521\n00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:33.410\nSo you just see a ton of\nstuff branching off from it.\n\n522\n00:27:33.410 --> 00:27:35.570\nAnd you'll see some big names.\n\n523\n00:27:35.570 --> 00:27:38.170\nAnother big name that's\nout there is Ubuntu.\n\n524\n00:27:38.170 --> 00:27:39.670\nYou'll hear a lot of\npeople talk about that.\n\n525\n00:27:39.670 --> 00:27:43.170\nThere's a company called Canonical,\nand they're distribution is Ubuntu.\n\n526\n00:27:43.170 --> 00:27:46.800\nIt's very popular because it's so\neasy to get it installed.\n\n527\n00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:48.650\nAnd it's got so\nmuch software package with it,\n\n528\n00:27:48.650 --> 00:27:52.420\nit's like just the complete deal all\nin one simple installer, all right.\n\n529\n00:27:52.420 --> 00:27:55.400\nWell, Ubuntu,\nthey didn't start from scratch.\n\n530\n00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:57.270\nThey're based on Debian.\n\n531\n00:27:57.270 --> 00:28:00.250\nSo they took the Debian\ndistribution as it was.\n\n532\n00:28:00.250 --> 00:28:03.340\nAnd modified it to make it super easy for\npeople.\n\n533\n00:28:03.340 --> 00:28:06.550\nAnd they've had great success\nas a result of that, right?\n\n534\n00:28:06.550 --> 00:28:10.730\nBy simplifying the operating system,\nand so you'll see that in here.\n\n535\n00:28:10.730 --> 00:28:14.680\nIf we follow the tree, here's the Debian,\nand I can spot it just by how big it is.\n\n536\n00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:17.550\nYou can see this one branch that\nleads to somebody down here\n\n537\n00:28:17.550 --> 00:28:19.390\nthat branches out a bunch,\nthat'll be Ubuntu.\n\n538\n00:28:19.390 --> 00:28:21.372\nLet me just kind of zoom in on that one.\n\n539\n00:28:24.936 --> 00:28:30.250\nAnd as I get closer you can almost\nread where it says Ubuntu now.\n\n540\n00:28:30.250 --> 00:28:31.240\nThere we go.\n\n541\n00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:35.215\nAnd you can see it branching out into all\nthese other different distributions and\n\n542\n00:28:35.215 --> 00:28:37.610\nyou'll see some big names in here.\n\n543\n00:28:37.610 --> 00:28:39.780\nLet me just skim over them.\n\n544\n00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:41.020\nSo far I'm not seeing big names.\n\n545\n00:28:41.020 --> 00:28:43.970\n[LAUGH] But\nyou will see some big names in here,\n\n546\n00:28:43.970 --> 00:28:46.690\npeople that are based off\nof Ubuntu like Linux Mint.\n\n547\n00:28:46.690 --> 00:28:51.960\nLinux Mint, I think is number four right\nnow in popularity and it, Linux Mint,\n\n548\n00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:56.740\nis a sub-distro of Ubuntu,\nwhich is a sub-distro of Debian.\n\n549\n00:28:56.740 --> 00:29:00.200\nAnd those guys right there, that's\nthree of the top four distributions,\n\n550\n00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:01.730\nare all actually based off of one.\n\n551\n00:29:01.730 --> 00:29:06.360\nSo it's kind of a neat little family\nof distributions that are out there.\n\n552\n00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:07.290\nAll right?\n\n553\n00:29:07.290 --> 00:29:10.010\nSo Debian, that's one of the big ones.\n\n554\n00:29:10.010 --> 00:29:12.150\nAnd because it's a big one,\n\n555\n00:29:12.150 --> 00:29:15.280\nit's one of the ones that we're going\nto talk about here in the show.\n\n556\n00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:16.732\nWe're going to see how to install Debian,\n\n557\n00:29:16.732 --> 00:29:19.720\nwe're actually going to do it\nlater in this episode, all right?\n\n558\n00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:23.063\nNow the main reason, well,\nyou know what, I'll get back to that.\n\n559\n00:29:23.063 --> 00:29:26.733\nI want to talk more about the main\nreason why Debian is so popular,\n\n560\n00:29:26.733 --> 00:29:29.361\nbut we'll get to that in a minute,\nall right?\n\n561\n00:29:29.361 --> 00:29:34.330\nAnother distro that's a root\none is Slackware, all right?\n\n562\n00:29:34.330 --> 00:29:36.470\nSlackware is the first Linux that I used.\n\n563\n00:29:36.470 --> 00:29:39.710\nI first installed it back in 1995,\nwhich was the early days of it.\n\n564\n00:29:39.710 --> 00:29:43.780\nI think it was like version 1.1 or\nsomething is what I started with.\n\n565\n00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:46.230\nIt was designed to be a true,\n\n566\n00:29:46.230 --> 00:29:50.160\nI forget what they used to say,\nunadulterated Linux.\n\n567\n00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:51.410\nThey didn't mess with it.\n\n568\n00:29:51.410 --> 00:29:54.700\nThey just gave it to you the way that it\nwas written and packaged together, and\n\n569\n00:29:54.700 --> 00:29:55.860\nyou could have at it.\n\n570\n00:29:55.860 --> 00:29:57.630\nIt's one of the longest running distros.\n\n571\n00:29:57.630 --> 00:30:00.500\nYou'll see that it is\nstill supported today.\n\n572\n00:30:00.500 --> 00:30:03.094\nSo it's been running for\na long, long time, and\n\n573\n00:30:03.094 --> 00:30:06.211\nyou'll see a lot of other\ndistributions branch off of it.\n\n574\n00:30:06.211 --> 00:30:10.422\nAnd you'll see some big names in here,\ntoo, like SUSE Linux,\n\n575\n00:30:10.422 --> 00:30:13.534\nwhich is the Linux that\nis a part of Novell now.\n\n576\n00:30:13.534 --> 00:30:16.810\nIt's kind of what they used to\nreplace their old operating system.\n\n577\n00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:22.640\nAnd then the last major\ndistribution is Red Hat.\n\n578\n00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:27.020\nRed Hat is a commercial operating system.\n\n579\n00:30:27.020 --> 00:30:31.370\nIn other words, these are people that\ncharge you money for the operating system.\n\n580\n00:30:31.370 --> 00:30:35.420\nYou can't just go and download\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux and run it.\n\n581\n00:30:35.420 --> 00:30:36.040\nYou gotta pay.\n\n582\n00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:37.720\nWell, I guess they have a demo,\na 30 day demo.\n\n583\n00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:40.320\nBut you've gotta pay to have access to it.\n\n584\n00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:43.820\nNow, in exchange for that,\nyou get software support, right?\n\n585\n00:30:43.820 --> 00:30:46.760\nYou can call them up on the phone and\nget help.\n\n586\n00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:50.220\nAnd they're much more\nfocused on corporate uses.\n\n587\n00:30:50.220 --> 00:30:54.120\nThe OS is not as fast\nchanging as the other ones,\n\n588\n00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:57.020\nthey do security reviews and\naudits of all their systems.\n\n589\n00:30:57.020 --> 00:31:02.110\nThey are much more business focused and\nthat cost money, all right.\n\n590\n00:31:02.110 --> 00:31:08.430\nBut Linux is open source, so whenever they\ndo any changes to Linux, or the kernel,\n\n591\n00:31:08.430 --> 00:31:12.910\nor the OS, or the packages, they have\nto make that available to the public.\n\n592\n00:31:12.910 --> 00:31:16.750\nAnd so you'll see all these other\ndistributions that branch off of it,\n\n593\n00:31:16.750 --> 00:31:20.070\nwhich are people benefiting from\nthe corporate backing of Red Hat.\n\n594\n00:31:20.070 --> 00:31:24.620\nSo those are kind of our three main\nones that we see, Debian, Slackware,\n\n595\n00:31:24.620 --> 00:31:25.670\nand Red Hat.\n\n596\n00:31:25.670 --> 00:31:29.480\nAnd on the exam, you're really\ngonna see Debian and Red Hat.\n\n597\n00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:31.120\nThose are the two main ones.\n\n598\n00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:33.725\nAnd so we're gonna take a look\nat how to install those.\n\n599\n00:31:33.725 --> 00:31:37.119\nAfter the installation, the operating\nof them is basically the same.\n\n600\n00:31:37.119 --> 00:31:38.996\nCommands you run on one\nare the same on the other, so\n\n601\n00:31:38.996 --> 00:31:40.358\nthere's not much variation there.\n\n602\n00:31:40.358 --> 00:31:43.417\nSo it's kind of nice to be able\nto jump between distros and\n\n603\n00:31:43.417 --> 00:31:45.152\nstill know what you're doing.\n\n604\n00:31:45.152 --> 00:31:46.243\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n605\n00:31:46.243 --> 00:31:47.115\n>> All right.\n\n606\n00:31:47.115 --> 00:31:50.260\nWell, Nate, this is probably a pretty\ngood spot to stop and take a break.\n\n607\n00:31:50.260 --> 00:31:52.180\n>> Yep.\n>> So, why don't we pause here and\n\n608\n00:31:52.180 --> 00:31:55.900\nwhen we get back, we're going to\ntake a deeper look at Debian and\n\n609\n00:31:55.900 --> 00:31:58.770\ntalk a little bit about it, get it\ninstalled and start to have some fun.\n\n610\n00:31:58.770 --> 00:31:59.700\n>> Sweet.\nSounds good.\n\n611\n00:31:59.700 --> 00:32:00.800\n>> All right.\nStay tuned.\n\n612\n00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:01.795\nWe'll be back after this.\n\n613\n00:32:01.795 --> 00:32:05.316\n[SOUND] All right,\n\n614\n00:32:05.316 --> 00:32:11.188\nnow welcome back everybody.\n\n615\n00:32:11.188 --> 00:32:14.734\nSo in the first segment we talked\nabout Linux in general, now what we're\n\n616\n00:32:14.734 --> 00:32:18.480\ngonna do is we're gonna talk about\nthe Debian distribution specifically.\n\n617\n00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:21.100\nSo I wanna kinda jump into that,\nand cover it.\n\n618\n00:32:21.100 --> 00:32:25.090\nIt is a very important distribution,\nright?\n\n619\n00:32:25.090 --> 00:32:28.000\nThere's many Linux distros out there and\nyou can pick and\n\n620\n00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.280\nchoose which ever you want\nto your heart's content.\n\n621\n00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:33.420\nYou know it is all a matter of kind of,\nwhat I said the first time right?\n\n622\n00:32:33.420 --> 00:32:35.660\nFinding one that matches\nthe goals that you have and\n\n623\n00:32:35.660 --> 00:32:37.820\nthen finding one that's\ngonna be around for a while.\n\n624\n00:32:37.820 --> 00:32:38.420\nRight?\n\n625\n00:32:38.420 --> 00:32:40.540\nThere are websites out\nthere like DistroWatch,\n\n626\n00:32:40.540 --> 00:32:43.070\nthey catalog all\nthe different distributions.\n\n627\n00:32:43.070 --> 00:32:45.130\nBut when I brought up that diagram,\n\n628\n00:32:45.130 --> 00:32:47.510\nin fact here let me bring\nthat diagram back up.\n\n629\n00:32:47.510 --> 00:32:49.540\nWhere did I put that thing.\n\n630\n00:32:49.540 --> 00:32:51.880\nHere.\nThe massive Linux family tree.\n\n631\n00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:52.480\nRight?\n\n632\n00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:56.770\nWhen I brought this up,\nyou may have noticed how Debian\n\n633\n00:32:56.770 --> 00:33:02.090\nreally has spawned more child\ndistributions than anyone else,\n\n634\n00:33:02.090 --> 00:33:06.340\neven organizations like Red Hat\nthat have sold more than Debian.\n\n635\n00:33:06.340 --> 00:33:07.170\nThey've spawned off more.\n\n636\n00:33:07.170 --> 00:33:08.700\nSo why is that?\n\n637\n00:33:08.700 --> 00:33:12.700\nWell, Debian was not the first\ndistribution of Linux.\n\n638\n00:33:12.700 --> 00:33:18.900\nIn fact, you'll see where Debian came\nout In the middle of 1993, and if you\n\n639\n00:33:18.900 --> 00:33:23.720\nlook down to Slackware and some of these\nother ones, they were released earlier.\n\n640\n00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:27.280\nWell I guess the full Slackware\nwas in the middle of 1993,\n\n641\n00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:30.210\nbut the original SLS was earlier.\n\n642\n00:33:30.210 --> 00:33:35.460\nSo Debian wasn't the first,\nthey weren't the first distro,\n\n643\n00:33:35.460 --> 00:33:37.860\nbut they were the first at something\nthat was really important.\n\n644\n00:33:37.860 --> 00:33:43.490\nThey were the first ones to say if\nyou find something you can do better,\n\n645\n00:33:43.490 --> 00:33:47.090\nyou can submit the change to us and\nwe'll take it.\n\n646\n00:33:47.090 --> 00:33:51.210\nPrior to that point, all of\nthe distros were privately curated so\n\n647\n00:33:51.210 --> 00:33:53.940\nthe guy who, I can't remember his name,\n\n648\n00:33:53.940 --> 00:33:57.320\nI feel bad, the guy who manages\nthe Slackware distribution.\n\n649\n00:33:57.320 --> 00:33:59.680\nHe was the one who was\nthe gatekeeper who said hey,\n\n650\n00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:03.060\nif there's gonna be\nchanges I'll make them, or\n\n651\n00:34:03.060 --> 00:34:05.660\nif you have a really good one you've gotta\nconvince me first and then I'll make it.\n\n652\n00:34:05.660 --> 00:34:06.390\nRight?\n\n653\n00:34:06.390 --> 00:34:09.430\nBut in Debian they created a constitution.\n\n654\n00:34:09.430 --> 00:34:10.540\nThey set up a democracy.\n\n655\n00:34:10.540 --> 00:34:13.980\nThey have votes when a change\ngets submitted there's a vote.\n\n656\n00:34:13.980 --> 00:34:18.920\nThere's not like one person who says\nthis is going in or this isn't, right?\n\n657\n00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:24.680\nThere's a lot of distributions that have\nthat like the OpenBSD Theo de Raadt,\n\n658\n00:34:24.680 --> 00:34:29.700\nright, who just is, he reigns with\nan iron fist on what goes into OpenBSD.\n\n659\n00:34:29.700 --> 00:34:31.410\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You have other distributions\n\n660\n00:34:31.410 --> 00:34:31.980\nthat are like that.\n\n661\n00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:33.540\nAnd that works out for them.\n\n662\n00:34:33.540 --> 00:34:36.990\nBut for Debian, they went from\nmuch more democratic system.\n\n663\n00:34:36.990 --> 00:34:39.784\nAnd that allowed them to get a lot\nof cool updates and features and\n\n664\n00:34:39.784 --> 00:34:42.430\nthing like that other\npeople weren't getting.\n\n665\n00:34:42.430 --> 00:34:45.440\nDebian was also very open to programmers.\n\n666\n00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:49.570\nThey released full sets of API,\ndocumentation, all the code.\n\n667\n00:34:49.570 --> 00:34:53.190\nEverything they had was completely\navailable to developers.\n\n668\n00:34:53.190 --> 00:34:55.810\nSo if you were a developer trying\nto pick out a distribution,\n\n669\n00:34:55.810 --> 00:34:57.090\nwhich one are you gonna pick?\n\n670\n00:34:57.090 --> 00:35:00.310\nOne that's super friendly to developers,\nand gives you the resources to make\n\n671\n00:35:00.310 --> 00:35:05.290\nchanges and push those changes upstream\nto get them in the original distro?\n\n672\n00:35:05.290 --> 00:35:08.710\nOr go with somebody else who isn't\ngonna listen to your suggestions,\n\n673\n00:35:08.710 --> 00:35:11.010\nisn't gonna take your changes in and\nthat's it.\n\n674\n00:35:11.010 --> 00:35:11.710\nAll right.\n\n675\n00:35:11.710 --> 00:35:14.680\nNow keep in mind when we talk about\nthe distribution, we are talking about\n\n676\n00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:18.690\nthe operating system as a whole, and\nnot necessarily the Linux kernel.\n\n677\n00:35:18.690 --> 00:35:22.740\nYou know Linux torvold still has an\namazing amount of control over the actual\n\n678\n00:35:22.740 --> 00:35:26.640\nLinux kernel itself, so\nit's not as public there.\n\n679\n00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:29.380\nBut Debian was the whole shebang.\n\n680\n00:35:29.380 --> 00:35:33.220\nThe user interface, the commands,\nthe tool set, all the various things, and\n\n681\n00:35:33.220 --> 00:35:34.880\nthey allowed for change.\n\n682\n00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:37.330\nThat made it a great hit with programmers.\n\n683\n00:35:37.330 --> 00:35:41.097\nAnd 20 years ago, that's what a lot of\nus referred to Debian as was, yeah,\n\n684\n00:35:41.097 --> 00:35:43.194\nthat's the programmer's distribution.\n\n685\n00:35:43.194 --> 00:35:44.983\nIf you wanna be a developer,\nif you are a developer,\n\n686\n00:35:44.983 --> 00:35:47.430\nthat's the one to go with because\nit gives you the most control.\n\n687\n00:35:47.430 --> 00:35:47.990\nRight?\n\n688\n00:35:47.990 --> 00:35:50.695\nVersus if you were an end user or\nan enterprise,\n\n689\n00:35:50.695 --> 00:35:54.990\nDebian wasn't necessarily the most\nfriendly because it changed quickly.\n\n690\n00:35:54.990 --> 00:35:58.220\nWhen new versions of software came\nout they would get it rolled out\n\n691\n00:35:58.220 --> 00:35:58.720\npretty quickly.\n\n692\n00:35:58.720 --> 00:36:01.300\nThey were on a six month\ndistribution cycle for a long time.\n\n693\n00:36:01.300 --> 00:36:05.240\nThat meant a new version\nof Debian every six months.\n\n694\n00:36:05.240 --> 00:36:08.130\nAnd that's a little too rapid for\na lot of businesses.\n\n695\n00:36:08.130 --> 00:36:10.710\nA lot of businesses don't\nnecessarily want new features.\n\n696\n00:36:10.710 --> 00:36:13.900\nThey want just hot fixes,\nsecurity patches.\n\n697\n00:36:13.900 --> 00:36:15.380\nWe'll worry about new\nfeatures down the road.\n\n698\n00:36:15.380 --> 00:36:17.480\nGive me new features every three years or\nsomething, right?\n\n699\n00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:19.940\nThat's the Microsoft and\nthe old Apple model.\n\n700\n00:36:21.460 --> 00:36:26.030\nBut Debian was much more about being\nable to support the latest things,\n\n701\n00:36:26.030 --> 00:36:30.060\nbeing able to keep up with what's out\nthere and provide the most functionality.\n\n702\n00:36:30.060 --> 00:36:31.350\nIt does a great job of it.\n\n703\n00:36:31.350 --> 00:36:36.460\nAnd that's why it branches out into more\nsub-distributions than anybody else.\n\n704\n00:36:36.460 --> 00:36:38.440\nIf you're gonna create\nyour own distribution,\n\n705\n00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:43.230\nwhy not base it on an upstream provider\nthat's very open to your changes.\n\n706\n00:36:43.230 --> 00:36:47.060\nThat you know is gonna stay up date, that\nyou know is not going to bottle neck you.\n\n707\n00:36:47.060 --> 00:36:50.400\nVersus if you based off of\nsomebody else who was slower,\n\n708\n00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:53.970\nnow you have to be slower as\na result of your upstream provider.\n\n709\n00:36:53.970 --> 00:36:54.830\n>> So then, Don, all right.\n\n710\n00:36:54.830 --> 00:36:58.760\nSo if people then can\nsubmit changes to Debian.\n\n711\n00:36:58.760 --> 00:37:03.210\nSo what, these are like security fixes,\nor compatibility stuff?\n\n712\n00:37:03.210 --> 00:37:06.730\nNot necessarily adding to like\nthe bloat of the program.\n\n713\n00:37:06.730 --> 00:37:08.870\nSo it's yeah.\n\n714\n00:37:08.870 --> 00:37:10.180\n>> Good point there, right?\n\n715\n00:37:10.180 --> 00:37:11.770\nSo when we talk about bloat.\n\n716\n00:37:11.770 --> 00:37:16.500\nWell, first off, you are right\non security fixes, hot fixes,\n\n717\n00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:19.180\nsecurity patches,\nany of that stuff obviously.\n\n718\n00:37:19.180 --> 00:37:23.480\nI'd like to open up flaw that\nhappened just a few months ago.\n\n719\n00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:26.130\nSomebody wrote a fix for that,\nit pushed it upstream and\n\n720\n00:37:26.130 --> 00:37:29.830\nnow it gets accepted in the general\ndistribution and that's it.\n\n721\n00:37:29.830 --> 00:37:33.730\nBut we also have new software,\nbigger updates like PHP.\n\n722\n00:37:33.730 --> 00:37:37.780\nIf you run a website today\nyou use the PHP libraries.\n\n723\n00:37:37.780 --> 00:37:42.120\nIf there's an update to PHP it\ncould break a lot of webpages.\n\n724\n00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:44.690\nSo they do a vote system to\ndetermine when they're ready\n\n725\n00:37:44.690 --> 00:37:46.530\nto run up to that next version of PHP.\n\n726\n00:37:46.530 --> 00:37:50.240\nAnd that way developers have time\nto get their websites corrected,\n\n727\n00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:54.440\nget their systems updated and then the new\nversion comes in and you're ready to rock.\n\n728\n00:37:54.440 --> 00:37:57.610\nVersus other distros that\nmight wait years to update\n\n729\n00:37:57.610 --> 00:38:00.885\nPHP because they don't want to\nbreak existing websites, right.\n\n730\n00:38:00.885 --> 00:38:05.028\n[LAUGH] Now, you mentioned bloat and I\nknow this is something I talk about a lot.\n\n731\n00:38:05.028 --> 00:38:10.000\n[LAUGH] The first version\nof Linux I installed,\n\n732\n00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:14.340\nSlackware, way back in the day,\nI just had to download three floppy discs.\n\n733\n00:38:14.340 --> 00:38:15.660\nRight?\nSo it was less than five\n\n734\n00:38:15.660 --> 00:38:18.560\nmegabytes of data and I had Linux up and\nrunning on my laptop.\n\n735\n00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:20.640\nIf you wanted the graphical\nuser interface,\n\n736\n00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:22.400\nit was like ten floppy discs, you know.\n\n737\n00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:25.690\nSo still not a whole heck of\na lot of data to get it done.\n\n738\n00:38:25.690 --> 00:38:27.920\nWell, over the years it has grown.\n\n739\n00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:29.530\nMillions of lines of code.\n\n740\n00:38:29.530 --> 00:38:32.710\nYou've had a lot of third party\napplications start to get packaged with\n\n741\n00:38:32.710 --> 00:38:35.000\nyour installation and\nit's grown and it's grown and\n\n742\n00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:37.910\nit's grown, so that now,\nmost distributions ship on a DVD.\n\n743\n00:38:37.910 --> 00:38:40.300\nThere's several gigabytes of data.\n\n744\n00:38:40.300 --> 00:38:42.610\nAnd it's kind of up to you.\n\n745\n00:38:42.610 --> 00:38:46.320\nWhen you do the Install,\nyou can do it to hold a minimal install.\n\n746\n00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:49.720\nWe say just give me the base operating\nsystem don;t mess around with other stuff.\n\n747\n00:38:49.720 --> 00:38:52.270\nAnd in that scenario your\ninstall will be very small.\n\n748\n00:38:52.270 --> 00:38:56.100\nUsually like 300 to 400 megabytes,\nnot a whole heck of a lot to it.\n\n749\n00:38:56.100 --> 00:38:58.410\nBut if you wanna fold UI.\n\n750\n00:38:58.410 --> 00:39:03.160\nAnd you want Open Office and you want\nFirefox or Google Chrome for web browsing.\n\n751\n00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:06.991\nIf you want all these extra features,\nall the sudden that distribution grows and\n\n752\n00:39:06.991 --> 00:39:07.846\ngrows and grows.\n\n753\n00:39:07.846 --> 00:39:12.240\nAnd with every piece of software you add,\nyou're increasing your attack surface.\n\n754\n00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:13.760\nAnd you're increasing the complexity.\n\n755\n00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:16.110\nAll the different software\nthat needs to be updated.\n\n756\n00:39:16.110 --> 00:39:17.830\nSo on a desktop, yeah.\n\n757\n00:39:17.830 --> 00:39:20.730\nWe'll normally go crazy and\ninstall a bunch of stuff there.\n\n758\n00:39:20.730 --> 00:39:25.720\nBut on a server, we'll normally do\na minimal install, and it is very tight.\n\n759\n00:39:25.720 --> 00:39:29.090\nSo even though all these new\nsoftware packages get added,\n\n760\n00:39:29.090 --> 00:39:30.780\ndoesn't necessarily mean\nthey're installed by default.\n\n761\n00:39:30.780 --> 00:39:32.340\nBut they are available for you.\n\n762\n00:39:32.340 --> 00:39:35.348\nYou can download them and add them,\nand they've been tested and\n\n763\n00:39:35.348 --> 00:39:36.917\nauthorized to work with Debian.\n\n764\n00:39:36.917 --> 00:39:38.171\nSo we're kinda covered there.\n\n765\n00:39:38.171 --> 00:39:41.327\n>> Nice.\n\n766\n00:39:41.327 --> 00:39:42.280\n>> One other thing that I want to mention.\n\n767\n00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:43.528\nI know this is kinda silly.\n\n768\n00:39:43.528 --> 00:39:45.962\nWe always get people in the chat room or\n\n769\n00:39:45.962 --> 00:39:49.845\npeople supporting tickets about\nhow we pronounce things and\n\n770\n00:39:49.845 --> 00:39:54.750\nmore than once I've gotten the,\nyou're pronouncing Debian wrong.\n\n771\n00:39:54.750 --> 00:39:59.520\nAnd I can tell you that on their website\nthey have an official how to pronounce,\n\n772\n00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:01.040\nand it is pronounced Debian.\n\n773\n00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:04.740\nAnd the reason is it's actually\nnamed after the original author.\n\n774\n00:40:04.740 --> 00:40:07.850\nHis name was Ian, and his wife Debra.\n\n775\n00:40:07.850 --> 00:40:11.060\nAnd so it's a combination of Debra and\nIan, and thus it's Debian.\n\n776\n00:40:11.060 --> 00:40:14.509\nSo, you'll hear people say Debian or\nDebby Ann.\n\n777\n00:40:14.509 --> 00:40:15.850\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I've heard all sorts of crazy ones.\n\n778\n00:40:15.850 --> 00:40:18.630\nBut it is just Debian in this case.\n\n779\n00:40:18.630 --> 00:40:21.570\nNow, it was originally\ncreated by one person.\n\n780\n00:40:21.570 --> 00:40:23.020\nIt's grown significantly.\n\n781\n00:40:23.020 --> 00:40:25.900\nNow there are literally\nthousands of people active on\n\n782\n00:40:25.900 --> 00:40:28.720\nthe operating system at any given time,\nas far as development and\n\n783\n00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:31.500\nmanagement because they have\nthat democratic system in place.\n\n784\n00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:32.130\nIt's really cool.\n\n785\n00:40:33.310 --> 00:40:37.200\nSo if you're goal Is to have\nthe most feature available\n\n786\n00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:40.065\nto be able to push\nchanges into the system.\n\n787\n00:40:40.065 --> 00:40:41.040\nDebian is the one for you.\n\n788\n00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:42.710\nThey're aligned with your goal.\n\n789\n00:40:42.710 --> 00:40:45.440\nAnd they're gonna be around for\na long time.\n\n790\n00:40:45.440 --> 00:40:48.710\nAnd that's because there's a lot of\ncommercial entities that have an interest\n\n791\n00:40:48.710 --> 00:40:49.320\nin Debain.\n\n792\n00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:52.040\nCanonical is probably the biggest one.\n\n793\n00:40:52.040 --> 00:40:53.700\nThey're the ones who produce Ubuntu.\n\n794\n00:40:53.700 --> 00:40:57.680\nThey have a for sale product\nthat you can pay money for and\n\n795\n00:40:57.680 --> 00:40:59.760\nit's based off of Debian.\n\n796\n00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:03.167\nAnd so canonical kicks money\nupstream to support Debian and\n\n797\n00:41:03.167 --> 00:41:05.860\nin their own changes and fixes go into it.\n\n798\n00:41:05.860 --> 00:41:08.270\nSo that kind of shores it up and\nkeeps the distribution alive.\n\n799\n00:41:08.270 --> 00:41:11.960\nAnd there's other vendors,\nif you look at that kind of family tree.\n\n800\n00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:15.540\nYou've got Knoppix which breaks off of it,\nthat's another big one.\n\n801\n00:41:15.540 --> 00:41:17.160\nAnd several others.\n\n802\n00:41:17.160 --> 00:41:20.380\nAnd so these are all people that\nare pushing those changes upstream and\n\n803\n00:41:20.380 --> 00:41:21.970\nkeeping that distribution alive.\n\n804\n00:41:21.970 --> 00:41:25.320\nI doubt we'll see Debian\ngo anywhere anytime soon.\n\n805\n00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:26.480\nThey're gonna be around a long time.\n\n806\n00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:28.440\nSo they're a great distribution.\n\n807\n00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:32.010\nThe other thing to remember\nis if you learn Debian.\n\n808\n00:41:32.010 --> 00:41:33.130\nThe skills and\n\n809\n00:41:33.130 --> 00:41:36.260\ntools you learn apply to those other\noperating systems that build off of it.\n\n810\n00:41:36.260 --> 00:41:40.040\nSo, if we learn Debian we also\nknow Knoppix, we also know Ubuntu,\n\n811\n00:41:40.040 --> 00:41:43.250\nor Kubuntu, or any of the various\nother ones that branch off.\n\n812\n00:41:43.250 --> 00:41:45.510\nSo you get that nice,\nwell-rounded education.\n\n813\n00:41:45.510 --> 00:41:46.605\nDefinitely a good one to start with.\n\n814\n00:41:46.605 --> 00:41:47.110\n>> Mm-hm, nice.\n\n815\n00:41:48.760 --> 00:41:49.700\n>> All right.\nSo\n\n816\n00:41:49.700 --> 00:41:52.390\nlet's say that you guys\nwant to get started, right?\n\n817\n00:41:52.390 --> 00:41:54.420\nYou wanna get Linux installed so\n\n818\n00:41:54.420 --> 00:41:57.610\nthat you can learn the stuff and\nDebian is the distribution for you.\n\n819\n00:41:57.610 --> 00:41:58.270\nAll right?\n\n820\n00:41:58.270 --> 00:41:59.330\nWell, it's pretty easy to get it.\n\n821\n00:41:59.330 --> 00:42:00.470\nIt is free, right?\n\n822\n00:42:00.470 --> 00:42:01.820\nSo that's kinda nice.\n\n823\n00:42:01.820 --> 00:42:04.700\nAnd you just go to their website,\nyou go to debian.org.\n\n824\n00:42:04.700 --> 00:42:07.380\nAnd so that's where I am right now,\njust on their website.\n\n825\n00:42:07.380 --> 00:42:09.310\nThe website is pretty sparse.\n\n826\n00:42:09.310 --> 00:42:12.400\nAs far as the layout you'll see that on\na lot of Linux websites, they don't go for\n\n827\n00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:15.260\nthe flash and circumstance and all that.\n\n828\n00:42:15.260 --> 00:42:18.380\nBut you'll have a nice big link right\nat the top that says getting Debian.\n\n829\n00:42:18.380 --> 00:42:19.770\nWhere do we get it?\n\n830\n00:42:19.770 --> 00:42:22.740\nAnd they have several different\ndistribution methods that\n\n831\n00:42:22.740 --> 00:42:23.860\nare out there now.\n\n832\n00:42:23.860 --> 00:42:27.900\nRemember, they are not charging you\na dime for this operating system.\n\n833\n00:42:27.900 --> 00:42:33.930\nSo, they get money from some of\nthe sub-distributions that kick up funds,\n\n834\n00:42:33.930 --> 00:42:36.570\nbut also from just contributors,\npeople who donate.\n\n835\n00:42:36.570 --> 00:42:41.370\nAnd so you'll see donate links every,\nhere in about, you know I say that.\n\n836\n00:42:41.370 --> 00:42:41.990\nWhere is that?\n\n837\n00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:46.412\nWell, apparently they have gotten\na little less pushy about it.\n\n838\n00:42:46.412 --> 00:42:49.900\nBut you'll see, it's in here somewhere,\nwhere you can donate, you can send money.\n\n839\n00:42:49.900 --> 00:42:52.160\nYou can buy physical\ncopies of their discs,\n\n840\n00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:55.910\nwhich will also help to fund them\nthere it is, donations, right there.\n\n841\n00:42:55.910 --> 00:42:58.900\nSo you can go in and\nyou can make donations into them.\n\n842\n00:42:58.900 --> 00:43:00.810\nAnd that's kind of how they stay alive,\nright?\n\n843\n00:43:00.810 --> 00:43:02.800\nCorporate sponsors and donations.\n\n844\n00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:06.430\nSo you definitely want to support\nthem if you benefit from the product.\n\n845\n00:43:06.430 --> 00:43:09.150\nBut otherwise, it is free,\nso when we go to get it,\n\n846\n00:43:09.150 --> 00:43:12.680\nwhat they do is they need to keep\ntheir costs down to a minimum.\n\n847\n00:43:12.680 --> 00:43:16.690\nSo they're going to push you to use\nsome kind of peer to peer software for\n\n848\n00:43:16.690 --> 00:43:18.470\ndownloading the distribution.\n\n849\n00:43:18.470 --> 00:43:21.540\nThe most common one is BitTorrent and\nso when you go to download\n\n850\n00:43:21.540 --> 00:43:24.710\na lot of these links that they discuss\nhere, will actually link to torrent.\n\n851\n00:43:24.710 --> 00:43:28.680\nSo see here,\nI've got the 64 bit DVD torrent,\n\n852\n00:43:28.680 --> 00:43:31.400\nthe 32 bit DVD torrent, and so on.\n\n853\n00:43:31.400 --> 00:43:35.180\nA lot of people associate torrents\nwith stealing illegal software, right.\n\n854\n00:43:35.180 --> 00:43:36.695\nThere's no legitimate use for it.\n\n855\n00:43:36.695 --> 00:43:37.250\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But\n\n856\n00:43:37.250 --> 00:43:41.360\nthere actually is a legitimate use and\nthis is a great example which is, one\n\n857\n00:43:41.360 --> 00:43:48.000\nperson could download the ISO from Debian,\nand then they begin to see that torrent.\n\n858\n00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:50.190\nOther people can start to\ndownload from the first person.\n\n859\n00:43:50.190 --> 00:43:52.150\nAnd when you start downloading a torrent,\n\n860\n00:43:52.150 --> 00:43:55.460\nyou're also uploading to the other\npeople that are out there.\n\n861\n00:43:55.460 --> 00:43:58.420\nAnd so\nyou're sharing some of your bandwidth, and\n\n862\n00:43:58.420 --> 00:44:00.530\nthat's kind of like the price you pay.\n\n863\n00:44:00.530 --> 00:44:04.430\nBy downloading this software for free,\nyou're paying them with a little bit of\n\n864\n00:44:04.430 --> 00:44:08.280\nyour bandwidth to other people who\nmight be downloading at the same time.\n\n865\n00:44:08.280 --> 00:44:11.400\nIt's a nice way to give back\nto keep their costs low.\n\n866\n00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:13.180\nSo that they don't shut down.\n\n867\n00:44:13.180 --> 00:44:18.134\nAnd so we typically wanna use the torrents\nwhen possible because that does help them.\n\n868\n00:44:18.134 --> 00:44:21.464\n>> Mm-hm, yeah, and\nsometimes going to mirrors,\n\n869\n00:44:21.464 --> 00:44:24.410\nthe mirrors can be\na little slow sometimes.\n\n870\n00:44:24.410 --> 00:44:27.490\nBut going on a torrents when\nyou're getting a little piece from\n\n871\n00:44:27.490 --> 00:44:29.160\neverybody out there who's seeding it.\n\n872\n00:44:29.160 --> 00:44:31.710\nAnd so it can get transfers very fast.\n\n873\n00:44:31.710 --> 00:44:33.920\n>> And you mentioned the mirrors.\n\n874\n00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:37.410\nSo, we also do have links to go\nto the mirrors, you can go in for\n\n875\n00:44:37.410 --> 00:44:40.790\na complete installation image here and\nyou can go in and download it.\n\n876\n00:44:40.790 --> 00:44:43.050\nThere's a series of DVDs\nthat you can get and\n\n877\n00:44:43.050 --> 00:44:47.830\nthey have HTTP and the FTP links where\nyou can go in and directly download it.\n\n878\n00:44:47.830 --> 00:44:51.460\nA lot of times you are sent to a mirror,\nand that's a third party that has\n\n879\n00:44:51.460 --> 00:44:55.550\noffered to maintain a copy of\nthe entire Debian distribution.\n\n880\n00:44:55.550 --> 00:44:57.700\nSo when you go and download,\ninstead of herding Debian again,\n\n881\n00:44:57.700 --> 00:45:00.060\nyou're just pulling from one\nof these other providers.\n\n882\n00:45:00.060 --> 00:45:02.670\nSo use those when you can also.\n\n883\n00:45:02.670 --> 00:45:06.710\nIf you really want to support them though,\nbuy a set of the DVDs.\n\n884\n00:45:06.710 --> 00:45:10.620\nYou can pay them and they will ship\nto you a nice set of the DVDs,\n\n885\n00:45:10.620 --> 00:45:11.950\neven if you never use them.\n\n886\n00:45:11.950 --> 00:45:13.030\nI do this with open BSD.\n\n887\n00:45:13.030 --> 00:45:15.865\nI buy the physical discs,\neven though I never use them,\n\n888\n00:45:15.865 --> 00:45:17.550\ncuz I just download the ISO.\n\n889\n00:45:17.550 --> 00:45:21.610\nBut buying those discs you are basically\nsupporting them financially, so\n\n890\n00:45:21.610 --> 00:45:22.860\nit's kind of a nice thing to do.\n\n891\n00:45:24.350 --> 00:45:27.890\nIf you're going to download it though,\nand you don't want to use the torrents,\n\n892\n00:45:27.890 --> 00:45:32.230\nthen you can do where you go here to\ndownload a small installation image.\n\n893\n00:45:32.230 --> 00:45:34.430\nThey have a network bootable disc.\n\n894\n00:45:34.430 --> 00:45:35.160\nIt's a CD.\n\n895\n00:45:35.160 --> 00:45:37.960\nIt's only 2 or 300 megs in size.\n\n896\n00:45:37.960 --> 00:45:42.210\nYou boot off of it and it starts the\ninstaller, and as you pick the features\n\n897\n00:45:42.210 --> 00:45:46.550\nyou want, it goes out and it downloads\nthe features at the install time.\n\n898\n00:45:46.550 --> 00:45:48.380\nThe nice part here is you're\nnot downloading a bunch of\n\n899\n00:45:48.380 --> 00:45:49.190\nfeatures you don't need.\n\n900\n00:45:49.190 --> 00:45:51.590\nYou're only downloading\nthe stuff that you want,\n\n901\n00:45:51.590 --> 00:45:54.240\nwhich again minimizes the impact\non the download servers.\n\n902\n00:45:54.240 --> 00:45:55.860\nBut if you're going to be\ninstalling Debian a lot, and\n\n903\n00:45:55.860 --> 00:45:59.060\nyou're going to be messing around\nwith a lot of the features,\n\n904\n00:45:59.060 --> 00:46:01.520\neventually you're going to want\nthat full DVD installation.\n\n905\n00:46:02.570 --> 00:46:05.360\nSo when we go to do the install\nyou might chose to go ahead and\n\n906\n00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:07.610\ndo the complete installation image.\n\n907\n00:46:08.740 --> 00:46:12.790\nIf we go that route, now we start to\nget choices on how we want, to get it.\n\n908\n00:46:12.790 --> 00:46:15.570\nWe can buy the CD-ROMs or DVDs, right?\n\n909\n00:46:15.570 --> 00:46:17.200\nAnd again, supporting them financially.\n\n910\n00:46:17.200 --> 00:46:19.720\nYou'll see downloading\nthem with BitTorrent.\n\n911\n00:46:19.720 --> 00:46:21.240\nThere's another option.\n\n912\n00:46:21.240 --> 00:46:25.080\nAnd then you'll see downloading\nit with HTTP or FTP,\n\n913\n00:46:25.080 --> 00:46:29.090\nwhich let's you pull it down based on\nyour choice from a mirror, all right?\n\n914\n00:46:29.090 --> 00:46:32.140\nSome of the other options we'll see,\ndownload them with Jigdo.\n\n915\n00:46:32.140 --> 00:46:34.830\nI'm not sure that I'm\npronouncing that right.\n\n916\n00:46:34.830 --> 00:46:36.530\nI've never actually used jigdo.\n\n917\n00:46:36.530 --> 00:46:40.790\nI usually see this and laugh a little bit,\nbut it's similar to BitTorrent.\n\n918\n00:46:40.790 --> 00:46:44.170\nIt's just another peer-to-peer type\nclient where when you download,\n\n919\n00:46:44.170 --> 00:46:45.440\nyou're also uploading.\n\n920\n00:46:45.440 --> 00:46:49.370\nIt's not very popular, and I think it\nmight have actually originated here.\n\n921\n00:46:49.370 --> 00:46:53.040\nBut yeah, basically it allows you to pull\nyour information from various mirrors and\n\n922\n00:46:53.040 --> 00:46:55.210\nto kinda support their environments.\n\n923\n00:46:55.210 --> 00:46:56.990\nSo you've got that option too.\n\n924\n00:46:56.990 --> 00:47:01.100\nAnd then lastly, you've got where\nyou can download live images.\n\n925\n00:47:01.100 --> 00:47:03.390\nNow what's a live image?\n\n926\n00:47:03.390 --> 00:47:05.630\nNormally what we want\nis an installation DVD.\n\n927\n00:47:05.630 --> 00:47:08.990\nA DVD that if you boot off of it,\nit starts the installer and\n\n928\n00:47:08.990 --> 00:47:12.700\nit lets you install Linux to\nthe hard drive of your computer.\n\n929\n00:47:12.700 --> 00:47:15.600\nBut what if you just wanna mess around\nwith Linux a little bit, right?\n\n930\n00:47:15.600 --> 00:47:17.200\nWhat if you don't wanna\nformat your hard drive,\n\n931\n00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:20.250\nthat at the end of the day you've got\nwhatever your accounting software is, or\n\n932\n00:47:20.250 --> 00:47:22.610\nsomething like that on your laptop and\nyou don't wanna lose it.\n\n933\n00:47:22.610 --> 00:47:23.590\nSo you just want to experiment.\n\n934\n00:47:23.590 --> 00:47:28.650\nWell, most of us will bring up a virtual\nmachine, you can use Oracle VirtualBox or\n\n935\n00:47:28.650 --> 00:47:32.030\nZen or any of the number of\n\n936\n00:47:32.030 --> 00:47:35.520\nvirtualization software packages\nthat are out there that are free.\n\n937\n00:47:35.520 --> 00:47:38.911\nSo you can use those, or\nyou can download a live CD.\n\n938\n00:47:38.911 --> 00:47:42.104\nWhat a live CD is is\nthe full installation of\n\n939\n00:47:42.104 --> 00:47:47.087\nDebian that will run from the CD\nwithout touching your hard drive.\n\n940\n00:47:47.087 --> 00:47:51.800\nYou boot off of this disk and it creates\nlike a little swap space in memory,\n\n941\n00:47:51.800 --> 00:47:55.221\nin RAM, and\nthen it brings the operating system up and\n\n942\n00:47:55.221 --> 00:47:58.770\nit runs directly from the CD or\nDVD, all right?\n\n943\n00:47:58.770 --> 00:48:01.380\nThat's cool because it gives\nyou a chance to explore and\n\n944\n00:48:01.380 --> 00:48:05.920\nkind of learn the Linux environment, but\nthen when you turn your computer off,\n\n945\n00:48:05.920 --> 00:48:08.340\nyour hard drive was untouched and\nyou're back to normal.\n\n946\n00:48:08.340 --> 00:48:11.500\nSo, great for experimenting around.\n\n947\n00:48:11.500 --> 00:48:14.990\nYou can actually install Debian from the\nlive CD if you want, so you could download\n\n948\n00:48:14.990 --> 00:48:18.910\nit and use it as an installer, but\ntypically we'll go for the install discs.\n\n949\n00:48:18.910 --> 00:48:24.660\n>> As long as you have enough RAM on your\nPC, you can still install things to that\n\n950\n00:48:24.660 --> 00:48:29.740\nlive CD, and things you will\ninstall will just go into RAM.\n\n951\n00:48:29.740 --> 00:48:34.545\nAs long as you have enough, yeah you\ncould use it until you turn off your PC.\n\n952\n00:48:34.545 --> 00:48:39.650\nThen everything is gone, but\na real great way to try it out.\n\n953\n00:48:39.650 --> 00:48:41.120\n>> And that's not unique to Debian,\n\n954\n00:48:41.120 --> 00:48:43.070\nyou'll see that with a lot of\noperating systems that are out there.\n\n955\n00:48:43.070 --> 00:48:46.600\nIf you wanna try out some of\nthe other distros they usually have\n\n956\n00:48:46.600 --> 00:48:48.610\nlive CDs like that.\n\n957\n00:48:48.610 --> 00:48:51.010\nAll right, but I'm gonna go ahead and\ngo the HTTP FTP route.\n\n958\n00:48:51.010 --> 00:48:54.950\nI've already downloaded it so we don't\nhave to download it, but I wanna show you,\n\n959\n00:48:54.950 --> 00:48:58.350\nwhen you you go to download it, you're\ngonna get a couple of choices in here.\n\n960\n00:48:58.350 --> 00:49:02.170\nAnd you'll see where it lets you\ndownload the stable release and\n\n961\n00:49:02.170 --> 00:49:03.870\nthe testing release.\n\n962\n00:49:03.870 --> 00:49:06.280\nThe stable release is the one that's done,\n\n963\n00:49:06.280 --> 00:49:10.350\nready to be used in production, it usually\ngets an update about every six months.\n\n964\n00:49:10.350 --> 00:49:14.220\nAnd so you can go and get it and it's got\nthe latest software in it and off you go.\n\n965\n00:49:14.220 --> 00:49:16.540\nThat's typically what we're going to do,\nall right?\n\n966\n00:49:17.750 --> 00:49:22.560\nBut If you're on the edge, If you are all\nabout the bleeding edge of technology,\n\n967\n00:49:22.560 --> 00:49:25.210\nif you're a developer and\nyou're doing a lot of testing for\n\n968\n00:49:25.210 --> 00:49:28.170\nyour software compatibility,\nyou also have the testing distro.\n\n969\n00:49:28.170 --> 00:49:31.070\nAnd what they do they build\nthis one every week, so\n\n970\n00:49:31.070 --> 00:49:35.350\nevery week, it contains all\nthe new patches and updates.\n\n971\n00:49:35.350 --> 00:49:38.060\nTypically they roll up\nthe updates over six months and\n\n972\n00:49:38.060 --> 00:49:39.440\nthen package it as a new release.\n\n973\n00:49:39.440 --> 00:49:41.700\nThis one I have the updates\nevery single week.\n\n974\n00:49:41.700 --> 00:49:46.550\nSo little too edgy for me,\nI don't normally go that route.\n\n975\n00:49:46.550 --> 00:49:49.800\n>> I suppose though if you did have\nsome kind of line of business apps or\n\n976\n00:49:49.800 --> 00:49:52.390\nsomething, if you are wanting\nto be in production,\n\n977\n00:49:52.390 --> 00:49:58.200\nthat would give you a chance to\nget your own software up to snuff.\n\n978\n00:49:58.200 --> 00:50:00.309\nSo that way when you do\nroll out a stable release,\n\n979\n00:50:00.309 --> 00:50:02.360\nyou're already running real great.\n\n980\n00:50:02.360 --> 00:50:03.190\n>> Yeah.\nAbsolutely.\n\n981\n00:50:03.190 --> 00:50:05.000\nIt just gives that little head start.\n\n982\n00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:05.890\n>> Nice.\n\n983\n00:50:05.890 --> 00:50:09.782\n>> So I'll go into the stable releases and\nhere it's gonna offer for\n\n984\n00:50:09.782 --> 00:50:12.130\nus to download ISO images of the discs.\n\n985\n00:50:12.130 --> 00:50:16.410\nAnd those are just digital copies of\nthe disc that we can burn to CD or\n\n986\n00:50:16.410 --> 00:50:18.020\nDVD if we want.\n\n987\n00:50:18.020 --> 00:50:20.440\nThere are CD and DVD distributions.\n\n988\n00:50:20.440 --> 00:50:25.500\nThe difference is not the operating system\nbut the extra packaged software with it.\n\n989\n00:50:25.500 --> 00:50:30.390\nThe DVD has the full set of all\npackages available right there on disc.\n\n990\n00:50:30.390 --> 00:50:34.340\nSo you can do a complete install\nwithout a network connection and\n\n991\n00:50:34.340 --> 00:50:36.270\ninstall all the various software packages.\n\n992\n00:50:36.270 --> 00:50:39.229\nYou want OpenOffice and all that other\nstuff, it's there, it's on the discs.\n\n993\n00:50:40.350 --> 00:50:43.250\nVersus if you go the CD\nroute they've stripped out\n\n994\n00:50:43.250 --> 00:50:45.140\na lot of things like OpenOffice.\n\n995\n00:50:45.140 --> 00:50:48.660\nAnd that way you have a much more\nlimited selection of software but\n\n996\n00:50:48.660 --> 00:50:51.260\nit fits on a CD, which is really handy\n\n997\n00:50:51.260 --> 00:50:53.835\ncuz you might not have a DVD drive\nin the system you're working on.\n\n998\n00:50:53.835 --> 00:50:55.930\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I know most people do.\n\n999\n00:50:55.930 --> 00:50:58.969\nBut anyhow, it is smaller, so\nit makes things a little easier to manage.\n\n1000\n00:51:00.630 --> 00:51:03.795\nEither way when you go to download them\nyour main choice is gonna be which\n\n1001\n00:51:03.795 --> 00:51:05.580\narchitecture you're running.\n\n1002\n00:51:05.580 --> 00:51:09.295\nAnd it's talking about the CPU,\nthe processor in your computer.\n\n1003\n00:51:09.295 --> 00:51:13.920\nDebian support a large selection so if\nyou look at some these that are in here,\n\n1004\n00:51:13.920 --> 00:51:17.880\nyou've got,\ndidn't I mention the Sun SPARC processors?\n\n1005\n00:51:17.880 --> 00:51:19.060\n>> Yeah.\n>> I think I mentioned that in\n\n1006\n00:51:19.060 --> 00:51:20.570\nthe first segment.\n\n1007\n00:51:20.570 --> 00:51:22.581\nSo, you'll see they\nstill support Sun SPARC.\n\n1008\n00:51:22.581 --> 00:51:25.099\nSo, I can go if I have a SPARC or\nUltra SPARC machine,\n\n1009\n00:51:25.099 --> 00:51:27.820\nI can download this distro and\nrun just fine.\n\n1010\n00:51:27.820 --> 00:51:31.705\nIf you've got an older Mac that\nstill has a PowerPC processor in it,\n\n1011\n00:51:31.705 --> 00:51:36.015\nwell they've got a PowerPC build right\nthere so you can fire that up and go.\n\n1012\n00:51:36.015 --> 00:51:40.993\nAnd I shouldn't just say an older Mac,\ncuz there are still current machines,\n\n1013\n00:51:40.993 --> 00:51:44.096\ndoesn't the PlayStation\nstill using PowerPC?\n\n1014\n00:51:44.096 --> 00:51:46.316\n>> Uhmm maybe\n>> I the PlayStation 3 did,\n\n1015\n00:51:46.316 --> 00:51:49.130\nI think the 4 does too, I don't know.\n\n1016\n00:51:49.130 --> 00:51:51.110\nBut, cuz they didn't have\nall that weird stuff.\n\n1017\n00:51:51.110 --> 00:51:54.500\nBut you still see PowerPC\nprocessors used in systems and\n\n1018\n00:51:54.500 --> 00:51:58.100\nso, some Cisco routers still use PowerPC.\n\n1019\n00:51:58.100 --> 00:52:00.465\nSo, if you wanted to run\nDebian on your Cisco router.\n\n1020\n00:52:00.465 --> 00:52:03.090\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We laugh about this, people do it.\n\n1021\n00:52:03.090 --> 00:52:05.790\nThen they've got the PPC build there.\n\n1022\n00:52:05.790 --> 00:52:08.970\nSo that's what each of these\nare is just different processors.\n\n1023\n00:52:08.970 --> 00:52:12.420\nS390, that's an IBM mainframe processor.\n\n1024\n00:52:14.430 --> 00:52:19.320\nWe've got ARM, and we see a lot of\nARM stuff now for the mobile devices.\n\n1025\n00:52:19.320 --> 00:52:24.420\nBut on a PC, we're typically gonna\nbe dealing with AMD64 or I386.\n\n1026\n00:52:24.420 --> 00:52:31.680\nThat's a 32-bit Intel or AMD processor,\nor a 64-bit Intel processor.\n\n1027\n00:52:31.680 --> 00:52:36.290\nNow remember, on a 64-bit Intel or AMD\nprocessor, you can still run the 32-bit if\n\n1028\n00:52:36.290 --> 00:52:39.980\nyou want, but\nthere's some little quirks to that, right?\n\n1029\n00:52:39.980 --> 00:52:42.270\nAnd if you're just getting\nstarted out in Linux,\n\n1030\n00:52:42.270 --> 00:52:43.450\nwe don't necessarily\nhave to worry about it.\n\n1031\n00:52:43.450 --> 00:52:45.550\nBut if you're coming\nfrom the Windows world,\n\n1032\n00:52:45.550 --> 00:52:50.210\nthere's this bad rumor, myth whatever.\n\n1033\n00:52:50.210 --> 00:52:54.990\nIn the Windows world if you run\na 32-bit OS then your desktop will not\n\n1034\n00:52:54.990 --> 00:52:57.310\nrecognize more than three gigs of memory,\nand\n\n1035\n00:52:57.310 --> 00:53:02.650\nthat's a really weird thing because 32-bit\ncan address up to four gigs by default.\n\n1036\n00:53:02.650 --> 00:53:03.180\nSo why is that?\n\n1037\n00:53:03.180 --> 00:53:05.350\nWell, it's cuz Microsoft chose to do that,\n\n1038\n00:53:05.350 --> 00:53:07.680\nit's actually a software\nlimitation they put in there.\n\n1039\n00:53:07.680 --> 00:53:09.970\nLinux doesn't have that\nsoftware limitation.\n\n1040\n00:53:09.970 --> 00:53:14.350\nSo if you go with a 32-bit OS,\nyou can actually recognize 16, 32 gigs,\n\n1041\n00:53:14.350 --> 00:53:16.770\nI forget what the upper limit is,\nit's very high.\n\n1042\n00:53:16.770 --> 00:53:19.450\nBut you can recognize huge\namounts of memory, but\n\n1043\n00:53:19.450 --> 00:53:23.410\nno one process can use more\nthan four gigs of that memory.\n\n1044\n00:53:23.410 --> 00:53:24.030\nAll right, so\n\n1045\n00:53:24.030 --> 00:53:29.020\nif you're running MySQL, well it can\naccess four gigs of memory and that's it.\n\n1046\n00:53:29.020 --> 00:53:32.230\nIf you want it to access more you'd have\nto run multiple instances of MySQL, and\n\n1047\n00:53:32.230 --> 00:53:34.950\nthere are some special compiled\nbuilds that do multi-threading\n\n1048\n00:53:34.950 --> 00:53:36.110\nto be able to do that.\n\n1049\n00:53:36.110 --> 00:53:38.873\nBut the better option\nwould be to go 64-bit and\n\n1050\n00:53:38.873 --> 00:53:42.330\nthen MySQL could recognize by\nitself far more than four gigs.\n\n1051\n00:53:42.330 --> 00:53:46.580\nSo just because you have say eight gigs\nof RAM doesn't mean you have to go 64-bit\n\n1052\n00:53:46.580 --> 00:53:47.500\nto use it.\n\n1053\n00:53:47.500 --> 00:53:49.290\nIf you're running several applications,\n\n1054\n00:53:49.290 --> 00:53:51.830\nthey can all benefit from that eight\ngigs of ram, even on a 32-bit or less.\n\n1055\n00:53:51.830 --> 00:53:53.140\n>> That right?\n\n1056\n00:53:53.140 --> 00:53:56.640\n>> Yep,\ncommon misconception that I see a lot.\n\n1057\n00:53:56.640 --> 00:54:00.190\nNow it used to be that we\nstuck with the 32-bit anyway,\n\n1058\n00:54:00.190 --> 00:54:03.020\njust because most software\nsupported it a little bit better.\n\n1059\n00:54:03.020 --> 00:54:06.980\nBut, this episode is\nbeing filmed in 2014 and\n\n1060\n00:54:06.980 --> 00:54:10.350\nby this point,\nalmost all software supports 64-bit now.\n\n1061\n00:54:10.350 --> 00:54:15.450\nSo, I can't remember the last time I did\n32-bit, I almost always do 64 bit now.\n\n1062\n00:54:15.450 --> 00:54:19.430\nAnd just because it says AMD 64 doesn't\nmean you have to have an AMD processor.\n\n1063\n00:54:19.430 --> 00:54:23.317\nIntel is AMD 64 compatible,\nthey actually license that from AMD,\n\n1064\n00:54:23.317 --> 00:54:25.274\nit's their dirty little secret.\n\n1065\n00:54:25.274 --> 00:54:28.932\n[LAUGH] That's cuz Intel has their own\n64-bit architecture which is right here,\n\n1066\n00:54:28.932 --> 00:54:30.840\nItanium 64, and it's not very good.\n\n1067\n00:54:30.840 --> 00:54:32.480\nI mean, it is good,\n\n1068\n00:54:32.480 --> 00:54:36.580\nit's just not generally accepted so\nnot a lot of people have it.\n\n1069\n00:54:36.580 --> 00:54:38.690\nSo AMD 64 is normally\nwhat we're shooting for.\n\n1070\n00:54:39.880 --> 00:54:42.950\nAll right, so if you want the CD,\nyou go the CD route, if you want the DVD,\n\n1071\n00:54:42.950 --> 00:54:43.830\nyou go the DVD route.\n\n1072\n00:54:43.830 --> 00:54:46.530\nThey often go to the same site,\njust a different folder.\n\n1073\n00:54:46.530 --> 00:54:50.790\nAnd, when you go into that folder,\nyou'll see that I'm in the iso-dvd folder\n\n1074\n00:54:50.790 --> 00:54:53.750\ninstead of iso-cd, and\nthat's where you'll have your choice.\n\n1075\n00:54:53.750 --> 00:54:59.210\nNow, notice there is more than one DVD,\nso what's going on here?\n\n1076\n00:54:59.210 --> 00:55:01.955\nWell, most of this is just MD5 and\nshod check sums, so\n\n1077\n00:55:01.955 --> 00:55:04.890\nwe can verify that the files\nhaven't been tampered with.\n\n1078\n00:55:05.910 --> 00:55:08.270\nBut the rest of them\nare the actual images.\n\n1079\n00:55:08.270 --> 00:55:12.550\nYou'll see five, so we've got our main\nones here, DVD number one, two, and\n\n1080\n00:55:12.550 --> 00:55:16.370\nthree and then you've got updates,\nupdate one and two.\n\n1081\n00:55:16.370 --> 00:55:20.790\nSo if you've already got a full\ninstall and you're not on the network,\n\n1082\n00:55:20.790 --> 00:55:24.474\nand you wanna update that\nmachine from Debian 7 to 7.5,\n\n1083\n00:55:24.474 --> 00:55:28.477\nyou could download these two update\nDVDs and do the full update.\n\n1084\n00:55:28.477 --> 00:55:32.990\nNow most of the time,\nyou only need the first DVD.\n\n1085\n00:55:32.990 --> 00:55:37.950\nYou don't actually need all of them,\nand the reason is DVD one has the main\n\n1086\n00:55:37.950 --> 00:55:42.590\nLinux distribution that's on there,\nthe main software packages,\n\n1087\n00:55:42.590 --> 00:55:46.603\nthe things that most people\nneed on an average day, right.\n\n1088\n00:55:46.603 --> 00:55:48.948\nSo that's what's on DVD-1.\n\n1089\n00:55:48.948 --> 00:55:51.050\nDVD-2 and DVD-3,\n\n1090\n00:55:51.050 --> 00:55:55.570\nthose are packed full of additional\nsoftware that is not nearly as popular.\n\n1091\n00:55:55.570 --> 00:55:59.300\nThings that people don't typically\nuse you might use it, right.\n\n1092\n00:55:59.300 --> 00:56:03.170\nBut it's just not something that\n80% of the users make use of.\n\n1093\n00:56:03.170 --> 00:56:04.910\nAnd so\nthat gets stuck off onto the other DVDs.\n\n1094\n00:56:04.910 --> 00:56:07.379\nThe other thing that gets on\nthere are the other languages.\n\n1095\n00:56:07.379 --> 00:56:10.860\nSo, if you're using English, great.\n\n1096\n00:56:10.860 --> 00:56:14.950\nIt's all right there on DVD-1, but\nif you're loading Czechoslovakian,\n\n1097\n00:56:14.950 --> 00:56:17.750\nif you're loading Russian,\nif you're loading French, well,\n\n1098\n00:56:17.750 --> 00:56:21.080\na lot of the files to support\nthat are on the other DVDs.\n\n1099\n00:56:21.080 --> 00:56:23.320\nSo, you may or may not need them.\n\n1100\n00:56:23.320 --> 00:56:26.741\nBecause I speak English that's\nwhat I wanna install and\n\n1101\n00:56:26.741 --> 00:56:30.977\nI usually just want typical software,\nDVD-1 is really all I need.\n\n1102\n00:56:30.977 --> 00:56:35.059\nIf I download the other ones, I can choose\nto provide them during the install, but\n\n1103\n00:56:35.059 --> 00:56:38.450\nif you don't have them, you just\nmove right past it and off it goes.\n\n1104\n00:56:39.960 --> 00:56:41.620\n>> Yeah, and\nwell then still after the fact though,\n\n1105\n00:56:41.620 --> 00:56:45.380\nI mean you can still download them\nafter the fact as individual packages.\n\n1106\n00:56:45.380 --> 00:56:45.990\n>> Yeah.\n\n1107\n00:56:45.990 --> 00:56:46.550\n>> Right?\n\n1108\n00:56:46.550 --> 00:56:47.750\n>> Yeah, you've always got that control.\n\n1109\n00:56:47.750 --> 00:56:49.590\nYou've got the package\nmanager we'll talk about,\n\n1110\n00:56:49.590 --> 00:56:52.960\nwhere you can add this stuff in straight\nfrom the internet if you need it.\n\n1111\n00:56:52.960 --> 00:56:56.870\nSo don't go and download all three DVDs\ncuz you'll see that's like an extra\n\n1112\n00:56:56.870 --> 00:57:01.718\neight gigs of data And\nyou may not even need DVD-2 and DVD-3.\n\n1113\n00:57:01.718 --> 00:57:02.969\n>> Nice.\n\n1114\n00:57:02.969 --> 00:57:06.670\n>> All right, and\nif you browse around on their website, so\n\n1115\n00:57:06.670 --> 00:57:11.090\nI’m in the debian-cd folder and\nI’m looking at the DVD ISOs.\n\n1116\n00:57:11.090 --> 00:57:13.890\nBut you can go in here,\nand find the ISO CD.\n\n1117\n00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:19.230\nAnd so there we go, and we'll see if\nthe CDs are available in here too.\n\n1118\n00:57:19.230 --> 00:57:23.130\nAnd it's a lot more CDs, because it's\nhard to fit all that stuff on there.\n\n1119\n00:57:23.130 --> 00:57:25.310\nBut again,\nif you're doing a basic install, and\n\n1120\n00:57:25.310 --> 00:57:28.150\nyou're not picking anything special,\nCD-1 may be all you need.\n\n1121\n00:57:28.150 --> 00:57:30.070\nSo, you can get installed very quickly.\n\n1122\n00:57:30.070 --> 00:57:32.880\nAnd where's the net installer,\nthere it is.\n\n1123\n00:57:32.880 --> 00:57:37.520\nIf you want to do that network install,\nyou'll see it's only 222 megabytes.\n\n1124\n00:57:37.520 --> 00:57:39.490\nSo you could fire that up and\n\n1125\n00:57:39.490 --> 00:57:42.450\nthen the machine will grab the packages\nit needs from the internet.\n\n1126\n00:57:42.450 --> 00:57:43.905\nSo, that's another way\nto quickly get started.\n\n1127\n00:57:43.905 --> 00:57:46.010\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1128\n00:57:46.010 --> 00:57:49.290\n>> Alright, you'll also notice other\nthings that are in here, like they've\n\n1129\n00:57:49.290 --> 00:57:54.710\nstarted doing some Blu-rays, so you'll see\nBD every now and then for Blu-ray discs.\n\n1130\n00:57:54.710 --> 00:57:58.160\nI don't have a Blu-ray drive, so\nit's not something I'm going to do,\n\n1131\n00:57:58.160 --> 00:58:00.210\nbut you'll see some of the other\nones that are out there.\n\n1132\n00:58:00.210 --> 00:58:01.869\nAnd there's a ton of\nstuff if you roam around.\n\n1133\n00:58:01.869 --> 00:58:05.519\nAnd they do keep the previous\nversions of Debian posted, so\n\n1134\n00:58:05.519 --> 00:58:09.899\nwhen you come in here, see how I'm\nseeing like 7.5 and the live CD and\n\n1135\n00:58:09.899 --> 00:58:13.370\ncurrent, I'm not seeing\nany of the old stuff.\n\n1136\n00:58:13.370 --> 00:58:17.380\nWell, the mirrors that are out there don't\ntypically maintain the old versions and\n\n1137\n00:58:17.380 --> 00:58:18.850\nI was on a mirror right there.\n\n1138\n00:58:18.850 --> 00:58:21.600\nBut if you go to the main distribution\nsite, you can find where they'll\n\n1139\n00:58:21.600 --> 00:58:24.488\ntypically have the previous versions\nbecause you might need that.\n\n1140\n00:58:24.488 --> 00:58:28.610\nJust because 7.5 is out,\ndoesn't mean you're ready to adopt it yet.\n\n1141\n00:58:28.610 --> 00:58:30.980\nYou might still need 6, right.\n\n1142\n00:58:30.980 --> 00:58:34.170\nAnd they actually just announced\nthis morning about how Debian 6.0\n\n1143\n00:58:34.170 --> 00:58:38.570\nwas gonna be considered a long\nterm support release So\n\n1144\n00:58:38.570 --> 00:58:42.780\nthey're gonna continue supporting it for\nsecurity fixes, not for new features.\n\n1145\n00:58:42.780 --> 00:58:44.290\nThey won't release new features for it.\n\n1146\n00:58:44.290 --> 00:58:48.590\nBut security fixes and hot fixes, so it's\nperfectly safe to run to Debian 6.0 if you\n\n1147\n00:58:48.590 --> 00:58:51.850\nwant, if you need that,\nif your software's compatible with that.\n\n1148\n00:58:51.850 --> 00:58:55.480\nAnd so yeah, you can jump in and\nthey've got an archive available.\n\n1149\n00:58:55.480 --> 00:58:57.480\nThe mirror that I was on didn't have it.\n\n1150\n00:58:57.480 --> 00:59:02.520\nSo let me see if I can\nfind a different mirror.\n\n1151\n00:59:04.540 --> 00:59:08.410\nIf in doubt use the primary\nCD image server in Sweden.\n\n1152\n00:59:08.410 --> 00:59:09.978\nLet's see, current live.\n\n1153\n00:59:12.748 --> 00:59:18.091\nWell, shoot, I, Yeah,\n\n1154\n00:59:18.091 --> 00:59:21.800\nI normally FTP into a different site to\npull them, but yeah you can find them.\n\n1155\n00:59:21.800 --> 00:59:23.920\nThey do have those previously releases.\n\n1156\n00:59:23.920 --> 00:59:24.870\nHere, there we go.\n\n1157\n00:59:24.870 --> 00:59:28.890\nFor older releases, blah, blah, blah,\npublished on the separate CD release page.\n\n1158\n00:59:28.890 --> 00:59:31.480\nThere we go, and so\nwe can come in here and, wow,\n\n1159\n00:59:31.480 --> 00:59:35.240\nthis page hasn't been updated in a while,\nhas it.\n\n1160\n00:59:35.240 --> 00:59:37.180\nThe list below is no\nlonger being maintained.\n\n1161\n00:59:37.180 --> 00:59:41.170\nGreat, so [LAUGH] but they are out there.\n\n1162\n00:59:41.170 --> 00:59:44.398\nIt's just a matter of\ntracking down the archive.\n\n1163\n00:59:44.398 --> 00:59:47.516\nLet's see here is the CD image archive and\n\n1164\n00:59:47.516 --> 00:59:51.080\nhere is the Debian 6.0,\nwhich is squeeze and\n\n1165\n00:59:51.080 --> 00:59:57.270\nlet's see we keep all images in jigdo\nformats that's why I wasn't seeing them.\n\n1166\n00:59:57.270 --> 01:00:00.220\nSo, all right so you can go and\nfind them though they are there.\n\n1167\n01:00:00.220 --> 01:00:02.990\nI always recommend if you install it,\nmaintain a copy of the disc yourself,\n\n1168\n01:00:02.990 --> 01:00:04.360\njust so you've got it.\n\n1169\n01:00:04.360 --> 01:00:07.190\nBut you can always redownload them.\n\n1170\n01:00:07.190 --> 01:00:10.310\n>> Nice, all right, Don,\nwell now that we can get the software and\n\n1171\n01:00:10.310 --> 01:00:13.590\nwe know which one that we're getting for\nwhat architecture and what size and what\n\n1172\n01:00:13.590 --> 01:00:18.260\nroute of install I think I'm ready to get\nthis thing fired up and take a look at it.\n\n1173\n01:00:18.260 --> 01:00:19.155\n>> All right, awesome.\n\n1174\n01:00:19.155 --> 01:00:22.240\nWell, looking at the time it is about\ntime for us to stop and take a break.\n\n1175\n01:00:22.240 --> 01:00:23.370\nSo let's do this.\n\n1176\n01:00:23.370 --> 01:00:26.700\nWe'll take a break and when we get\nback we're going to install Debian.\n\n1177\n01:00:26.700 --> 01:00:28.690\nWe'll get a chance to see it,\nwe'll install it.\n\n1178\n01:00:28.690 --> 01:00:30.310\nKind of mess around with it a little bit.\n\n1179\n01:00:30.310 --> 01:00:34.850\nAnd, and just kind of take a look at some\nof the little things to be aware of.\n\n1180\n01:00:34.850 --> 01:00:37.890\nAnd yeah, that will make for\na good end of the show.\n\n1181\n01:00:37.890 --> 01:00:39.040\n>> Nice.\n>> All right, so stay tuned.\n\n1182\n01:00:39.040 --> 01:00:40.029\nWe'll be back in a few.\n\n1183\n01:00:40.029 --> 01:00:45.767\n[MUSIC]\n\n1184\n01:00:47.447 --> 01:00:49.010\nAll right, welcome back everybody.\n\n1185\n01:00:49.010 --> 01:00:51.720\nSo before we jump into the install,\nwe wanna double back on something.\n\n1186\n01:00:51.720 --> 01:00:54.420\nI mentioned that you can download\nthe previous versions of Debian, and so\n\n1187\n01:00:54.420 --> 01:00:56.755\nduring the previous break I found that.\n\n1188\n01:00:56.755 --> 01:00:59.940\nSo I was on the right site,\nI just was in the wrong folder.\n\n1189\n01:00:59.940 --> 01:01:03.964\nSo I was on CDimage.debian.org/mirror.\n\n1190\n01:01:03.964 --> 01:01:07.210\nInside of /CDimage/archive.\n\n1191\n01:01:07.210 --> 01:01:10.581\nThat's where you can find the previous\nversions and if you look,\n\n1192\n01:01:10.581 --> 01:01:13.287\nyou'll see they've got\nall the way back to 3.0.\n\n1193\n01:01:13.287 --> 01:01:16.235\nI don't know,\nmaybe before that they were just horrible.\n\n1194\n01:01:16.235 --> 01:01:18.320\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But after that,\n\n1195\n01:01:18.320 --> 01:01:19.930\nyou'll see all these different ones.\n\n1196\n01:01:19.930 --> 01:01:22.869\nAll the different major and\nminor revisions.\n\n1197\n01:01:22.869 --> 01:01:28.930\nSo, 7.5 is current, and you'll see\nthey've got 7.4, .3, .2 and so on.\n\n1198\n01:01:28.930 --> 01:01:32.470\nAnd I mentioned how they announced\nlong term support for Debian 6.0.\n\n1199\n01:01:32.470 --> 01:01:34.140\nI found that news announcement.\n\n1200\n01:01:34.140 --> 01:01:37.280\nI just heard about it today,\nand so it's so sad,\n\n1201\n01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:40.770\ncuz the announcement apparently came\nout almost two months ago April 24th.\n\n1202\n01:01:40.770 --> 01:01:43.560\nSorry, I don't know why I\njust heard about it today.\n\n1203\n01:01:43.560 --> 01:01:45.488\nBut they did long term support for\nDebian 6.0.\n\n1204\n01:01:45.488 --> 01:01:50.082\nAnd so that means they're gonna\ncontinue to do security patches for\n\n1205\n01:01:50.082 --> 01:01:52.749\nDebian 6.0 for a long time, right.\n\n1206\n01:01:52.749 --> 01:01:57.979\nAnd by a long time,\nI think it's 2017, 2016.\n\n1207\n01:01:57.979 --> 01:02:02.231\nSo until February of 2016, so you got two\nmore years that you can run even though\n\n1208\n01:02:02.231 --> 01:02:04.749\nit's an older version,\nit's nice and stable.\n\n1209\n01:02:04.749 --> 01:02:08.185\nAnd if it's powering your website and\neverything's happy,\n\n1210\n01:02:08.185 --> 01:02:11.100\nthen if it's not broken,\ndon't fix it type thing.\n\n1211\n01:02:11.100 --> 01:02:12.740\nSo, that's where you would go to get that.\n\n1212\n01:02:12.740 --> 01:02:15.890\nYou'd just pull it right there out of\nthe archives, so you'd come in and\n\n1213\n01:02:15.890 --> 01:02:18.850\nget the latest version of 6,\nwhich would be 6.0.9.\n\n1214\n01:02:18.850 --> 01:02:22.379\nAnd you can go in there and\ndownload away, right.\n\n1215\n01:02:22.379 --> 01:02:25.779\nSo if I want the ISO-DVD,\nand there they are.\n\n1216\n01:02:25.779 --> 01:02:26.399\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1217\n01:02:26.399 --> 01:02:30.820\n>> All right, so other than that though,\nwe want to take a look at the install.\n\n1218\n01:02:30.820 --> 01:02:32.860\nAll right, when we do the install, and\n\n1219\n01:02:32.860 --> 01:02:37.220\nI'm going to install 7.5, cuz you might\nas well do the latest if you can.\n\n1220\n01:02:37.220 --> 01:02:41.960\nBut when you do the install, you get your\nISO, right either the CD or the DVD and\n\n1221\n01:02:41.960 --> 01:02:43.110\nyou burn it to a disc.\n\n1222\n01:02:43.110 --> 01:02:45.050\nNow it depends on what\noperating system you're using.\n\n1223\n01:02:45.050 --> 01:02:47.610\nIf you're using Linux or OSX or\n\n1224\n01:02:47.610 --> 01:02:49.870\nWindows, they each have\ndifferent disk burning software.\n\n1225\n01:02:49.870 --> 01:02:54.940\nSo whatever it is that you use to burn CDs\nand DVDs, you basically burn it to a disk.\n\n1226\n01:02:54.940 --> 01:02:59.680\nIf you're using virtualization software\nlike VirtualBox or Zen or whatever\n\n1227\n01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:03.110\nthen these, leave it as an ISO and\nyou can mount it to the virtual machine.\n\n1228\n01:03:03.110 --> 01:03:04.479\nThat's actually what I'm going to do here.\n\n1229\n01:03:05.610 --> 01:03:08.450\nI'm running VMware Fusion so\nI've created a virtual machine and\n\n1230\n01:03:08.450 --> 01:03:11.060\njust attached the ISO to it.\n\n1231\n01:03:11.060 --> 01:03:14.590\nWhen you boot up off of that machine,\nit's gonna boot to the DVD, and\n\n1232\n01:03:14.590 --> 01:03:20.130\nyou're gonna be presented\nwith this screen right here.\n\n1233\n01:03:20.130 --> 01:03:23.130\nThe debian installer is really\npretty straightforward.\n\n1234\n01:03:23.130 --> 01:03:26.280\nThere's not much in here that's\ngonna blow your mind, and for\n\n1235\n01:03:26.280 --> 01:03:28.190\nthe most part you can\njust click next a bunch.\n\n1236\n01:03:28.190 --> 01:03:32.257\nBut let's talk about each of\nthe different options and what they do.\n\n1237\n01:03:32.257 --> 01:03:36.722\nRight off the bat we have a pretty\nimportant decision between doing\n\n1238\n01:03:36.722 --> 01:03:40.321\na regular install And\na graphic install, all right.\n\n1239\n01:03:40.321 --> 01:03:44.564\nDebian has a beautiful graphic\ninstaller that has nice windows, and\n\n1240\n01:03:44.564 --> 01:03:48.600\nit's wizard driven, and\nit looks great, and it's easy to use.\n\n1241\n01:03:48.600 --> 01:03:50.800\nAll mouse driven, and so on, right.\n\n1242\n01:03:50.800 --> 01:03:55.750\nBut if you're installing this on a server\nor on a system that has a non-supported\n\n1243\n01:03:55.750 --> 01:03:59.340\nvideo card, the graphics installer's\nnot gonna work, all right.\n\n1244\n01:03:59.340 --> 01:04:02.770\nSo try it, try and\ngo that route if you can.\n\n1245\n01:04:02.770 --> 01:04:06.730\nBut if the graphic installer hoses up for\nyou, you can just reboot,\n\n1246\n01:04:06.730 --> 01:04:11.020\ncome right back to this screen and choose\nto do the text-based installer instead.\n\n1247\n01:04:11.020 --> 01:04:12.730\nAnd you'll see that one's the default.\n\n1248\n01:04:12.730 --> 01:04:15.290\nThat if you just choose\nInstall it's actually\n\n1249\n01:04:15.290 --> 01:04:18.930\na text-based installer that's\ndesigned to work on any\n\n1250\n01:04:18.930 --> 01:04:22.310\nVGA compatible display which is\npretty much everything, right?\n\n1251\n01:04:22.310 --> 01:04:23.410\nThat's why it's the default.\n\n1252\n01:04:23.410 --> 01:04:25.490\nSo if you know your video card supporter,\n\n1253\n01:04:25.490 --> 01:04:27.360\nif you just want to try,\ngo for the graphic one.\n\n1254\n01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:28.916\nIt's pretty and\nyou can use your mouse, all right.\n\n1255\n01:04:28.916 --> 01:04:31.524\nBut if you go install,\nyou can use just a keyboard,\n\n1256\n01:04:31.524 --> 01:04:34.270\nyou don't even need a mouse\nto do the install with it.\n\n1257\n01:04:34.270 --> 01:04:37.130\nAnd it's equally straightforward,\nit's just not as pretty.\n\n1258\n01:04:37.130 --> 01:04:40.180\nAll right, the other options we have,\nwe have advanced options.\n\n1259\n01:04:40.180 --> 01:04:43.160\nIf we need to override some\nkind of boot settings.\n\n1260\n01:04:43.160 --> 01:04:47.730\nIf you need to manipulate the drives\nthat it sees, or whatever,\n\n1261\n01:04:47.730 --> 01:04:49.880\nthen you can go in and\nstart to tinker with that.\n\n1262\n01:04:49.880 --> 01:04:51.330\nHopefully you don't need to.\n\n1263\n01:04:51.330 --> 01:04:52.820\nYou've got a little help screen,\n\n1264\n01:04:52.820 --> 01:04:55.760\nit's not the most terribly helpful since\nit's all right here in the boot loader.\n\n1265\n01:04:55.760 --> 01:04:59.630\nYou are better off going to the website,\nbut it does have basic help in there.\n\n1266\n01:04:59.630 --> 01:05:02.910\nThen, you've got install\nwith speech synthesis.\n\n1267\n01:05:02.910 --> 01:05:08.300\nAnd this is useful for\npeople that have a visual disability.\n\n1268\n01:05:08.300 --> 01:05:11.530\nIf you're not able to read what's\non the screen the speech synthesis\n\n1269\n01:05:11.530 --> 01:05:12.810\nhelps with that.\n\n1270\n01:05:12.810 --> 01:05:15.940\nAll right, so I'm gonna go ahead and\ndo the text based installer.\n\n1271\n01:05:15.940 --> 01:05:19.990\nAnd the reason I want to do that is the\ntext base installer is pretty consistent\n\n1272\n01:05:19.990 --> 01:05:22.360\nacross all the different\ndistributions of Linux.\n\n1273\n01:05:22.360 --> 01:05:23.910\nIt's been around a long time.\n\n1274\n01:05:23.910 --> 01:05:28.040\nVersus the graphical install, which is\na little different for each distro, so\n\n1275\n01:05:28.040 --> 01:05:30.460\nI wanna go with something that's\na little more consistent and\n\n1276\n01:05:30.460 --> 01:05:31.388\nwe'll just go that route.\n\n1277\n01:05:31.388 --> 01:05:32.427\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1278\n01:05:32.427 --> 01:05:36.616\n>> All right, when I launch the text-based\ninstaller, it's gonna go into it and\n\n1279\n01:05:36.616 --> 01:05:40.758\nyou're gonna see a screen that if you ever\nworked with like DOS back in the day.\n\n1280\n01:05:40.758 --> 01:05:44.000\nSo, I mentioned I had an IBM PC Junior,\nit ran DOS 3.3.\n\n1281\n01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.740\nThat was where I kinda got started.\n\n1282\n01:05:46.740 --> 01:05:48.930\nAnd you used to see text\nscreens like this all the time,\n\n1283\n01:05:48.930 --> 01:05:50.430\nwhere it looked graphical, but\n\n1284\n01:05:50.430 --> 01:05:55.620\nit's really just ASCII code sequences to\nmake it look like the 3D box or whatever.\n\n1285\n01:05:55.620 --> 01:05:57.340\nSo this is pretty typical.\n\n1286\n01:05:57.340 --> 01:05:58.740\nAnd you can just use your up and\n\n1287\n01:05:58.740 --> 01:06:02.550\ndown arrows to choose between\nthe different options on the screen.\n\n1288\n01:06:02.550 --> 01:06:04.990\nHere it's asking what language to use for\nthe install.\n\n1289\n01:06:04.990 --> 01:06:08.420\nThis is pretty important,\nbecause if you don't speak English\n\n1290\n01:06:08.420 --> 01:06:10.640\nthese screens aren't going to\nbe very meaningful to you.\n\n1291\n01:06:10.640 --> 01:06:15.600\nAnd you'll see Debian supports a just\na wide selection of languages.\n\n1292\n01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:19.270\nThere are hundreds of people out there\nthat do a great job doing translations\n\n1293\n01:06:19.270 --> 01:06:20.860\ninto other languages to\nmake this really useful.\n\n1294\n01:06:20.860 --> 01:06:24.570\nAll right but I'll stick with English\nbecause I can barely speak it.\n\n1295\n01:06:24.570 --> 01:06:28.030\n[LAUGH] So I am not going to\nchallenge myself with something else.\n\n1296\n01:06:28.030 --> 01:06:31.720\nI can probably finish the installer in\nFrench but I'd probably make a mistake.\n\n1297\n01:06:31.720 --> 01:06:35.110\nAll right, so\nthen I need to pick my location, right.\n\n1298\n01:06:35.110 --> 01:06:40.320\nAnd the location that the reason it's\nasking for here is really two fold.\n\n1299\n01:06:40.320 --> 01:06:44.600\nThe main reason is so\nthat when you displace things currency and\n\n1300\n01:06:44.600 --> 01:06:47.250\ndate on the screen that is\nformatted the way that you do it.\n\n1301\n01:06:47.250 --> 01:06:48.189\nSo for example,\n\n1302\n01:06:48.189 --> 01:06:52.089\nhere in the United States we have\na number that has a decimal, right.\n\n1303\n01:06:52.089 --> 01:06:56.942\nIf I say that something cost\none dollar I write 1.00 but\n\n1304\n01:06:56.942 --> 01:07:02.510\nin Europe if you say something\ncost 1 Euro you might say 1,00.\n\n1305\n01:07:02.510 --> 01:07:05.500\nIt's just a difference in\nthe way we denote numbers.\n\n1306\n01:07:05.500 --> 01:07:07.990\nSo, picking your location sets that.\n\n1307\n01:07:07.990 --> 01:07:12.060\nIt also, helps us to do defaults\non the time zone screens as\n\n1308\n01:07:12.060 --> 01:07:13.970\nwell as the keyboard screen we\nare going to see coming up.\n\n1309\n01:07:13.970 --> 01:07:16.360\nIt's kind of just setting\nthat locality for you.\n\n1310\n01:07:16.360 --> 01:07:18.680\nYou can always change this later on But\n\n1311\n01:07:18.680 --> 01:07:20.658\nit makes life easier if you\npick it right in the beginning.\n\n1312\n01:07:20.658 --> 01:07:21.680\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1313\n01:07:21.680 --> 01:07:24.680\n>> All right,\nthen it asked about my keyboard.\n\n1314\n01:07:24.680 --> 01:07:26.290\nWhat kind of keyboard do I have?\n\n1315\n01:07:26.290 --> 01:07:31.340\nSo, for example a US English keyboard,\nthe top row of letters\n\n1316\n01:07:31.340 --> 01:07:36.130\nwe call QWERTY, right, Q-W-E-R-T-Y,\nthat's the order of those letters.\n\n1317\n01:07:36.130 --> 01:07:39.040\nBut if you have a French keyboard,\nit's AZERTY.\n\n1318\n01:07:39.040 --> 01:07:41.900\nThat top row is A-Z-E-R-T-Y.\n\n1319\n01:07:41.900 --> 01:07:45.560\nLetters are in different places, and so\nif you pick the wrong keyboard here,\n\n1320\n01:07:45.560 --> 01:07:47.630\nyou can get weird results, right.\n\n1321\n01:07:47.630 --> 01:07:50.840\nSo if I were to pick the French keyboard,\nwhen I hit my Q key,\n\n1322\n01:07:50.840 --> 01:07:52.460\nan A would actually come up on the screen.\n\n1323\n01:07:52.460 --> 01:07:54.030\nSo you've got to pick the right one.\n\n1324\n01:07:54.030 --> 01:07:55.009\nI'll go American English.\n\n1325\n01:07:57.120 --> 01:08:01.880\nAll right, now it's just doing a quick\nscan to see what I've got available.\n\n1326\n01:08:01.880 --> 01:08:03.210\nIt's trying to find two things.\n\n1327\n01:08:03.210 --> 01:08:07.140\nIt's trying to find my installation CD,\nwhich it should have already found.\n\n1328\n01:08:07.140 --> 01:08:09.850\nAnd then it's trying to find\nwhat hard drives are available,\n\n1329\n01:08:09.850 --> 01:08:12.570\njust to make sure that there's\nsomewhere I can install to.\n\n1330\n01:08:12.570 --> 01:08:14.250\nThis is fully automated process.\n\n1331\n01:08:14.250 --> 01:08:17.540\nThe only time you have to deal\nwith it is if there's an error.\n\n1332\n01:08:17.540 --> 01:08:21.370\nIf it can't find an installation media,\nif it doesn't detect any hard drives,\n\n1333\n01:08:21.370 --> 01:08:24.640\nit'd give you a message stating that.\n\n1334\n01:08:24.640 --> 01:08:25.770\n>> So's looking for\n\n1335\n01:08:25.770 --> 01:08:30.130\nyour network configuration and network\ncard and trying to auto set that stuff up.\n\n1336\n01:08:30.130 --> 01:08:33.490\n>> Yeah, it found my DVD and it said\nall right, we can install from that,\n\n1337\n01:08:33.490 --> 01:08:35.320\nbut I bet there have been updates.\n\n1338\n01:08:35.320 --> 01:08:38.830\nAnd so if it can find a network card and\nget a DHCP address and\n\n1339\n01:08:38.830 --> 01:08:41.720\nreach out to the internet, it can\nactually get updates during the install.\n\n1340\n01:08:41.720 --> 01:08:42.680\nSo it tries to do that.\n\n1341\n01:08:42.680 --> 01:08:46.120\nIf that fails,\nit just moves past it but it does try.\n\n1342\n01:08:46.120 --> 01:08:49.050\nIf I had done one of those net\ninstall disks, though, and\n\n1343\n01:08:49.050 --> 01:08:51.680\nit fails to find the network,\nit will not move past it.\n\n1344\n01:08:51.680 --> 01:08:54.120\nIt will stop and say,\nnetwork not detected, and\n\n1345\n01:08:54.120 --> 01:08:56.800\nyou'll have that chance to manually\nput in IP address and all that.\n\n1346\n01:08:58.970 --> 01:09:02.220\nFrom here on out, it's going to ask\na series of questions about how to\n\n1347\n01:09:02.220 --> 01:09:05.000\nuniquely configure this computer?\n\n1348\n01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.710\nAnd some of these things\nare easy to change later on,\n\n1349\n01:09:07.710 --> 01:09:10.440\nsome of these things are very\nhard to change later on.\n\n1350\n01:09:10.440 --> 01:09:13.340\nSo you're always better off getting\nthem set correctly in the beginning.\n\n1351\n01:09:13.340 --> 01:09:15.980\nWe'll see how to change a lot\nof them later on in the show.\n\n1352\n01:09:15.980 --> 01:09:18.870\nBut the first thing it's asking is for\na name for this computer.\n\n1353\n01:09:18.870 --> 01:09:21.340\nThe generic name with Debian is,\nwell, Debian.\n\n1354\n01:09:21.340 --> 01:09:24.800\nA lot of other distro's\ndefault to local host, right.\n\n1355\n01:09:24.800 --> 01:09:26.110\nBut you can change it to whatever.\n\n1356\n01:09:26.110 --> 01:09:30.450\nSo I'm gonna call this one dp-debian,\nall right.\n\n1357\n01:09:30.450 --> 01:09:33.128\nSo that's what,\nthat's Im gonna know this one is.\n\n1358\n01:09:33.128 --> 01:09:37.220\nThe name convention really needs\nto follow the rules for DNS.\n\n1359\n01:09:37.220 --> 01:09:39.570\nYou can put things like\nan underscore in there, but\n\n1360\n01:09:39.570 --> 01:09:44.970\nit's not a good idea cuz it can cause\nissues in some software, all right.\n\n1361\n01:09:44.970 --> 01:09:46.710\nThen it's gonna ask my domain name.\n\n1362\n01:09:46.710 --> 01:09:50.000\nSo I'm gonna set this up in lab.itpro.tv.\n\n1363\n01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:54.855\nIf you have a domain, you stick this under\nhere for DNS purposes, so I can look up\n\n1364\n01:09:54.855 --> 01:10:00.650\ndp.debian.lab.ITpro.tv and I should\nget the IP address for this machine.\n\n1365\n01:10:00.650 --> 01:10:02.650\nIf you don't have it,\nyou can leave it blank or\n\n1366\n01:10:02.650 --> 01:10:03.800\nyou can put whatever you want in there.\n\n1367\n01:10:03.800 --> 01:10:05.910\nIt doesn't really mess with things.\n\n1368\n01:10:07.760 --> 01:10:10.390\nAll right, then I'll press enter.\n\n1369\n01:10:10.390 --> 01:10:12.922\nNow it's going to ask us\nabout our root account.\n\n1370\n01:10:12.922 --> 01:10:16.720\nAll right, now during the installer\nit's going to set up two user accounts.\n\n1371\n01:10:16.720 --> 01:10:19.450\nOne user account is\ncalled the root account.\n\n1372\n01:10:19.450 --> 01:10:24.840\nAnd root in Linux Is like the overall\nsuper administrator account.\n\n1373\n01:10:24.840 --> 01:10:28.480\nThere is nothing the root user can't do,\nlike a double negative,\n\n1374\n01:10:28.480 --> 01:10:29.630\nall right that's confusing.\n\n1375\n01:10:29.630 --> 01:10:33.050\nOkay, so the root user can do everything,\nthat's a better way to put it.\n\n1376\n01:10:33.050 --> 01:10:35.670\nAnd that means the root\naccount is dangerous.\n\n1377\n01:10:35.670 --> 01:10:38.210\nIf an attacker is trying\nto break into your system,\n\n1378\n01:10:38.210 --> 01:10:39.900\nthey want to get that root account.\n\n1379\n01:10:39.900 --> 01:10:43.410\nThey want it because they\nknow it can do everything, so\n\n1380\n01:10:43.410 --> 01:10:45.460\nwe've got to take certain precautions.\n\n1381\n01:10:45.460 --> 01:10:48.880\nAnd one easy precaution is to\nnever use the root account.\n\n1382\n01:10:48.880 --> 01:10:50.990\nSo it’s going to set up two accounts for\nus.\n\n1383\n01:10:50.990 --> 01:10:53.640\nThe root account which\nhopefully we don’t use and\n\n1384\n01:10:53.640 --> 01:10:57.550\nthen a regular user account\nthat we should use.\n\n1385\n01:10:57.550 --> 01:11:00.810\nBut you do need that root account because\nif you’re going to be changing the system\n\n1386\n01:11:00.810 --> 01:11:02.360\nconfiguration you need it there.\n\n1387\n01:11:02.360 --> 01:11:06.020\nSo here is our chance to set\nan ultra-secure password.\n\n1388\n01:11:06.020 --> 01:11:09.975\nSo I'm of course gonna use the word,\npassword, all lowercase.\n\n1389\n01:11:09.975 --> 01:11:13.190\n[LAUGH] You do want it to\nbe more secure than that.\n\n1390\n01:11:13.190 --> 01:11:17.310\nWe'll type it twice here to verify, and we\ncan always change this password later on.\n\n1391\n01:11:17.310 --> 01:11:21.320\nNow, it's going to set up\na regular user account for\n\n1392\n01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:24.560\nme and this is the one that I\nshould use on a regular basis.\n\n1393\n01:11:24.560 --> 01:11:30.780\nSo I'm gonna punch in here that I am\nDon Pezet and that's the full name.\n\n1394\n01:11:30.780 --> 01:11:33.381\nNow it want's the username that'll\nactually type to log in and\n\n1395\n01:11:33.381 --> 01:11:34.863\nit just defaults to the first name.\n\n1396\n01:11:34.863 --> 01:11:38.718\nI'm gonna change it though, I like dpezet\nso that's who I'm gonna log in as.\n\n1397\n01:11:38.718 --> 01:11:40.517\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1398\n01:11:40.517 --> 01:11:44.423\n>> All right now what's my password\ngonna be You should definitely pick\n\n1399\n01:11:44.423 --> 01:11:47.063\nsomething different\nthan your root account.\n\n1400\n01:11:47.063 --> 01:11:50.348\nOf course I'm not going to do that, but\nyou should pick something different than\n\n1401\n01:11:50.348 --> 01:11:53.220\nyour root account so that if one\ngets compromised, the other isn't.\n\n1402\n01:11:53.220 --> 01:11:56.886\nAnd so I'll specify my other password.\n\n1403\n01:11:56.886 --> 01:11:57.868\nAll right.\n\n1404\n01:11:57.868 --> 01:12:00.130\nNext is gonna ask the time zone and\n\n1405\n01:12:00.130 --> 01:12:03.210\nnotice how the time zone has kind\nof defaulted to the United States.\n\n1406\n01:12:03.210 --> 01:12:07.000\nEastern, central, mountain, pacific,\nthese are our time zones in the US.\n\n1407\n01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.910\nIt's doing that because\nthe locality I picked earlier.\n\n1408\n01:12:09.910 --> 01:12:12.930\nIf I picked the wrong country earlier,\nI'm going to see time zones for\n\n1409\n01:12:12.930 --> 01:12:13.640\nthe wrong country.\n\n1410\n01:12:13.640 --> 01:12:17.040\nSo that's something that's important and\nthat's why we need to pick that locality.\n\n1411\n01:12:17.040 --> 01:12:17.690\nAll right?\n\n1412\n01:12:17.690 --> 01:12:20.190\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and pick the eastern\ntime zone which is where I am.\n\n1413\n01:12:22.200 --> 01:12:22.846\nAnd we'll move forward.\n\n1414\n01:12:26.388 --> 01:12:29.581\nNow, it's getting a couple of\nother components ready as it gets\n\n1415\n01:12:29.581 --> 01:12:31.900\nready to attack our hard drive, right?\n\n1416\n01:12:31.900 --> 01:12:34.860\nAnd by attack it, I mean if we're\ngonna install, it's gotta copy all\n\n1417\n01:12:34.860 --> 01:12:39.510\nthis data to our hard drive, but our hard\ndrive is probably not set up for Linux.\n\n1418\n01:12:39.510 --> 01:12:43.570\nOur hard drive might be completely blank,\nor it might have Windows or OSX.\n\n1419\n01:12:43.570 --> 01:12:45.780\nYou only have some other\noperating system on there.\n\n1420\n01:12:45.780 --> 01:12:48.802\nSo it's gonna ask us some choices\nabout how we wanna get this set up.\n\n1421\n01:12:48.802 --> 01:12:49.850\nAll right.\n\n1422\n01:12:49.850 --> 01:12:52.910\nWhen you look at these choices\nit breaks down like this.\n\n1423\n01:12:52.910 --> 01:12:57.050\nYou have an install that\nuses the whole disk.\n\n1424\n01:12:57.050 --> 01:13:01.070\nAnd then you have two other installs that\nuse the whole disk, but also use LVM,\n\n1425\n01:13:01.070 --> 01:13:03.210\nthe logical volume manager.\n\n1426\n01:13:03.210 --> 01:13:03.830\nAll right.\n\n1427\n01:13:03.830 --> 01:13:05.840\nOne is encrypted and one is not.\n\n1428\n01:13:05.840 --> 01:13:08.930\nAnd the last option is manual, where\nyou have full control of what happens.\n\n1429\n01:13:08.930 --> 01:13:09.620\nAll right.\n\n1430\n01:13:09.620 --> 01:13:11.110\nIf we choose guided,\n\n1431\n01:13:11.110 --> 01:13:15.220\nuse the entire disk, it's gonna take\nus into a little wizard, where it will\n\n1432\n01:13:15.220 --> 01:13:19.530\npartition out our entire hard drive\nwiping out whatever was on it already.\n\n1433\n01:13:19.530 --> 01:13:21.650\nSo it's basically gonna\nerase your disc and\n\n1434\n01:13:21.650 --> 01:13:25.230\ngive the whole thing over to the band,\nand off you go, all right?\n\n1435\n01:13:25.230 --> 01:13:26.790\nOne big disc and that's it.\n\n1436\n01:13:26.790 --> 01:13:28.250\nAll right.\n\n1437\n01:13:28.250 --> 01:13:32.162\nIf we want to use just part of our disk,\nwe've gotta go down to manual.\n\n1438\n01:13:32.162 --> 01:13:34.120\nAll right?\nWhen we go to manual,\n\n1439\n01:13:34.120 --> 01:13:38.130\nwe can say, well there's Windows already\non here, leave it be and let's add\n\n1440\n01:13:38.130 --> 01:13:42.090\nanother partition and we'll install the B\nin there and now I can dual boot, right?\n\n1441\n01:13:42.090 --> 01:13:45.410\nOr you just want to partition differently,\nyou can do that by going to manual.\n\n1442\n01:13:47.150 --> 01:13:51.260\nThe LVM, the Logical Volume Manager,\nthat's something that's a little bit new.\n\n1443\n01:13:51.260 --> 01:13:52.590\nIt came out several years ago,\n\n1444\n01:13:52.590 --> 01:13:54.590\nbut it's gained in popularity\nquite a bit since then.\n\n1445\n01:13:54.590 --> 01:13:57.690\nAnd it allows you to do\nsome more advanced things.\n\n1446\n01:13:57.690 --> 01:14:00.910\nIn the old standard, you had certain\nlimits to how many partitions you could\n\n1447\n01:14:00.910 --> 01:14:03.120\nhave and the size of the partitions and\n\n1448\n01:14:03.120 --> 01:14:07.150\npartitions were really just single\ncontainers that sat there and that was it.\n\n1449\n01:14:07.150 --> 01:14:08.680\nThey weren't very fancy.\n\n1450\n01:14:08.680 --> 01:14:13.340\nThe Logical Volume Manager adds\nthe ability for us to do software mirrors.\n\n1451\n01:14:13.340 --> 01:14:16.370\nSo I can have a partition that's\nnow mirrored to a second drive or\n\n1452\n01:14:16.370 --> 01:14:17.540\nseparate location.\n\n1453\n01:14:17.540 --> 01:14:20.260\nI can do software stripes,\nsoftware raid 5.\n\n1454\n01:14:20.260 --> 01:14:24.580\nYou get the ability to do\na lot of data optimization and\n\n1455\n01:14:24.580 --> 01:14:27.950\nredundancy using software\nfunctionality in the LDM.\n\n1456\n01:14:28.960 --> 01:14:33.620\nNow, I will be the first person to tell\nyou that you don't want to do this, and\n\n1457\n01:14:33.620 --> 01:14:37.120\nthat's because whenever you do\ndisc IL operations in software,\n\n1458\n01:14:37.120 --> 01:14:39.030\nit's always a performance hit.\n\n1459\n01:14:39.030 --> 01:14:43.170\nSo, whenever possible,\nyou wanna use hardware raid controllers.\n\n1460\n01:14:43.170 --> 01:14:46.890\nIf you wanna strite, if you wanna mirror,\nif you want Raid 5, Raid 10,\n\n1461\n01:14:46.890 --> 01:14:49.600\nwhatever, use a hardware raid controller.\n\n1462\n01:14:49.600 --> 01:14:50.890\nBelieve me, you'll thank me.\n\n1463\n01:14:50.890 --> 01:14:52.265\nIt's a huge performance difference.\n\n1464\n01:14:52.265 --> 01:14:53.330\nRight.\n\n1465\n01:14:53.330 --> 01:14:54.710\nBut if this is a test machine, or\n\n1466\n01:14:54.710 --> 01:14:58.210\nif it's just your work station, you might\nnot want to invest in that hardware.\n\n1467\n01:14:58.210 --> 01:15:01.230\nSo the logical volume manager\ngives you that ability.\n\n1468\n01:15:01.230 --> 01:15:03.138\nAll right.\nEven if you have a hardware raid\n\n1469\n01:15:03.138 --> 01:15:05.840\ncontroller, you may want\nto use the LVM anyway.\n\n1470\n01:15:05.840 --> 01:15:10.220\nThe reason is,\nit gives you the ability to do encryption.\n\n1471\n01:15:10.220 --> 01:15:12.960\nTBN has built in, or\nnot decryption, encryption.\n\n1472\n01:15:12.960 --> 01:15:13.780\nThere we go.\n\n1473\n01:15:13.780 --> 01:15:17.580\nI guess that was close, so I'm still\nright [LAUGH] for the time being.\n\n1474\n01:15:17.580 --> 01:15:22.520\nSo it allows you to encrypt\nthe contents of your hard drive as part\n\n1475\n01:15:22.520 --> 01:15:27.220\nof the base OS, and so we're not reliant\non third party products like True Crypt\n\n1476\n01:15:27.220 --> 01:15:30.300\nthat's now become somewhat questionable,\nand other products like that.\n\n1477\n01:15:30.300 --> 01:15:31.760\nIt's just built in the OS.\n\n1478\n01:15:31.760 --> 01:15:32.390\nAll right?\n\n1479\n01:15:32.390 --> 01:15:35.550\nYou can't do that if you\ndo just a standard install,\n\n1480\n01:15:35.550 --> 01:15:36.720\nyou need the LVM to do it.\n\n1481\n01:15:36.720 --> 01:15:37.830\nAll right.\n\n1482\n01:15:37.830 --> 01:15:42.030\nNow, this is one of those decisions\nthat's really hard to change later on.\n\n1483\n01:15:42.030 --> 01:15:43.970\nIf you don't have the LVM and\n\n1484\n01:15:43.970 --> 01:15:47.260\nyou decide you want it,\nyou really need to reformat your disks.\n\n1485\n01:15:47.260 --> 01:15:50.480\nAnd if you have the LVM and you decide\nyou wanna go back to just the standard,\n\n1486\n01:15:50.480 --> 01:15:52.600\nyou really need to reformat your disk,\nright.\n\n1487\n01:15:52.600 --> 01:15:56.851\nSo either way you're backing up your data,\nformat, re-partition, restore your data,\n\n1488\n01:15:56.851 --> 01:15:58.150\nit's a lot of work.\n\n1489\n01:15:58.150 --> 01:16:00.365\nYou want to make that decision early on.\n\n1490\n01:16:00.365 --> 01:16:04.060\nOkay.\nIf you want to choose the safest option,\n\n1491\n01:16:04.060 --> 01:16:07.320\nthe best bet is to use the entire disk and\nset up the LVM.\n\n1492\n01:16:07.320 --> 01:16:09.580\nRight.\nYou can have the LVM and\n\n1493\n01:16:09.580 --> 01:16:11.440\nnot use its advanced features.\n\n1494\n01:16:11.440 --> 01:16:14.620\nAnd that way it behaves\njust like a normal disk.\n\n1495\n01:16:14.620 --> 01:16:17.530\nBut you have the ability to add\nthe advanced features later on\n\n1496\n01:16:17.530 --> 01:16:19.470\nwithout doing any crazy formatting.\n\n1497\n01:16:19.470 --> 01:16:22.840\nSo that's kind of the safest option\nif you want to cover your bases and\n\n1498\n01:16:22.840 --> 01:16:24.490\nyou're not sure which one to choose.\n\n1499\n01:16:24.490 --> 01:16:25.906\nAll right?\nSo I'm gonna go that route.\n\n1500\n01:16:25.906 --> 01:16:27.065\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1501\n01:16:27.065 --> 01:16:28.614\n>> All right.\n\n1502\n01:16:28.614 --> 01:16:30.410\nThen, we're gonna install.\n\n1503\n01:16:30.410 --> 01:16:31.840\nI told it to use the entire disc,\n\n1504\n01:16:31.840 --> 01:16:35.300\nso it's going to give me\na list of drives in my system.\n\n1505\n01:16:35.300 --> 01:16:39.460\nNow, hopefully the name of the drive\nwill tell you enough about it.\n\n1506\n01:16:39.460 --> 01:16:42.840\nI'm in virtual machine so\nmine says VM ware virtual whatever.\n\n1507\n01:16:42.840 --> 01:16:43.430\nRight.\n\n1508\n01:16:43.430 --> 01:16:47.530\nBut yours will will normally say western\ndigital, or c gate, or whatever.\n\n1509\n01:16:47.530 --> 01:16:51.305\nAnd give you some information about\nthe drive, so you can pick the right one.\n\n1510\n01:16:51.305 --> 01:16:51.930\nOkay.\n\n1511\n01:16:51.930 --> 01:16:55.910\nIf the names are ambiguous, or you if you\nhave two drives at the same exact name,\n\n1512\n01:16:55.910 --> 01:16:57.430\nhow do you know which is which?\n\n1513\n01:16:57.430 --> 01:17:01.600\nWell, notice where in\nparentheses it says S D A.\n\n1514\n01:17:01.600 --> 01:17:02.460\nOkay.\n\n1515\n01:17:02.460 --> 01:17:03.500\nWhat is that?\n\n1516\n01:17:03.500 --> 01:17:08.500\nWell, on older systems,\non systems that are I D E.\n\n1517\n01:17:08.500 --> 01:17:11.478\nRight?\nThe old primary master, kind of master and\n\n1518\n01:17:11.478 --> 01:17:12.190\nslave.\n\n1519\n01:17:12.190 --> 01:17:14.370\nPrimary, secondary,\nwhatever the arrangement was.\n\n1520\n01:17:14.370 --> 01:17:19.876\nOn those older systems,\nyou would see two drives, HDA and HDB.\n\n1521\n01:17:19.876 --> 01:17:22.460\nSo HD which is hard drive and\nthen drive A and\n\n1522\n01:17:22.460 --> 01:17:26.110\ndrive B, where drive A was the master and\ndrive B was the slave.\n\n1523\n01:17:26.110 --> 01:17:31.430\nOr primary, secondary whatever terminology\nyour system used, so HDA, HDB.\n\n1524\n01:17:31.430 --> 01:17:36.350\nSCSI drives on the other hand used SDA,\nSDB, SDC and so on,\n\n1525\n01:17:36.350 --> 01:17:39.630\ncuz you could have up to 15\ndrives on the same channel.\n\n1526\n01:17:39.630 --> 01:17:43.130\nAnd so, they just did SD for\nSCSI drive and so on.\n\n1527\n01:17:43.130 --> 01:17:47.020\nWell, when SATA drives came out things\nstarted getting really confusing, and so\n\n1528\n01:17:47.020 --> 01:17:50.930\nthey just said forget it,\nwe're gonna call them all SD whatever.\n\n1529\n01:17:50.930 --> 01:17:55.380\nSo now, it really doesn't matter if\nyou've got SETA, or true SCSI, or SaaS,\n\n1530\n01:17:55.380 --> 01:17:55.930\nor whatever.\n\n1531\n01:17:55.930 --> 01:18:01.420\nThey all show up as SD and then a letter,\nand the letter identifies the drive order.\n\n1532\n01:18:01.420 --> 01:18:06.620\nSo, if I have serial attached or\nif I have SDA, right?\n\n1533\n01:18:06.620 --> 01:18:14.220\nNow I might have SDA0, SDA1, SDA2, SDA3,\nand those would be SDA, SDB, SDC, SDD.\n\n1534\n01:18:14.220 --> 01:18:16.710\nSo that's how I can identify it,\nby those drive letters.\n\n1535\n01:18:16.710 --> 01:18:21.360\nSDA, in this case, just identifies that\nthis is the first drive in my system.\n\n1536\n01:18:21.360 --> 01:18:24.880\nSo more than likely attached to SDA0,\nor in this case, it's VMware, so\n\n1537\n01:18:24.880 --> 01:18:27.245\nit shows a SCSI ID 0.\n\n1538\n01:18:27.245 --> 01:18:28.250\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1539\n01:18:28.250 --> 01:18:30.540\n>> All right, so\nI'm gonna pick that drive.\n\n1540\n01:18:32.720 --> 01:18:35.072\nAnd now it asks about\nthe partition scheme.\n\n1541\n01:18:35.072 --> 01:18:36.270\nAll right.\n\n1542\n01:18:36.270 --> 01:18:40.640\nThe default partition scheme is to make\nit where debian operates all inside of\n\n1543\n01:18:40.640 --> 01:18:41.440\none partition.\n\n1544\n01:18:41.440 --> 01:18:44.300\nAnd that's a little misleading cuz it does\nactually create a separate partition for\n\n1545\n01:18:44.300 --> 01:18:45.990\nthe swap file.\n\n1546\n01:18:45.990 --> 01:18:49.880\nThe swap file is, if we run out of\nphysical memory, we can use our hard drive\n\n1547\n01:18:49.880 --> 01:18:52.900\nas memory, and so creates this little\npartition to use for that, all right?\n\n1548\n01:18:52.900 --> 01:18:55.310\nSo it's gonna do that no matter\nwhich of these I choose.\n\n1549\n01:18:55.310 --> 01:18:59.130\nBut otherwise, everything else,\nwhat about the rest of my stuff?\n\n1550\n01:18:59.130 --> 01:19:02.665\nWell the default is to put\nit all in one big partition.\n\n1551\n01:19:02.665 --> 01:19:08.325\nThe risk there, is that if a user of your\nsystem starts downloading a ton of MP3s or\n\n1552\n01:19:08.325 --> 01:19:10.365\njust a bunch of junk, right?\n\n1553\n01:19:10.365 --> 01:19:14.775\nThey could fill up the hard drive and\ncause the operating system to freeze.\n\n1554\n01:19:14.775 --> 01:19:18.855\nSo a lot of people choose to make the home\npartition that's where you're user folders\n\n1555\n01:19:18.855 --> 01:19:24.050\nare, to make that home folder\nhave its own separate partition.\n\n1556\n01:19:24.050 --> 01:19:27.060\nAnd that way,\nif somebody fills that partition up,\n\n1557\n01:19:27.060 --> 01:19:29.470\nit doesn't affect the base\noperating system.\n\n1558\n01:19:29.470 --> 01:19:31.810\nSo it gives you a little bit\nof protection, all right?\n\n1559\n01:19:31.810 --> 01:19:33.410\nIt's not really a security thing.\n\n1560\n01:19:33.410 --> 01:19:34.818\nIt's more of a stability thing.\n\n1561\n01:19:34.818 --> 01:19:38.058\nAnd stability falls under security, so\nyou can kinda make that connection.\n\n1562\n01:19:38.058 --> 01:19:41.199\nThere's other folders you might\nwanna do the same thing with.\n\n1563\n01:19:41.199 --> 01:19:45.444\n/home, that's where your user data is.\n\n1564\n01:19:45.444 --> 01:19:49.360\n/usr, that's where most\nof our applications go,\n\n1565\n01:19:49.360 --> 01:19:52.038\nour applications that we install.\n\n1566\n01:19:52.038 --> 01:19:58.970\n/var, that is where a lot of our temporary\nfiles and our active stuff goes.\n\n1567\n01:19:58.970 --> 01:20:05.139\nIf you're running a web server, typically\nall of your website will be in /var/www.\n\n1568\n01:20:05.139 --> 01:20:08.305\nIt depends on the product you run,\nbut a lot of times it'll end up there.\n\n1569\n01:20:08.305 --> 01:20:12.020\nAnd then /tmp,\nthat is true temporary files.\n\n1570\n01:20:12.020 --> 01:20:13.640\nFiles that just kind of come and go.\n\n1571\n01:20:13.640 --> 01:20:17.150\nThese are all areas where we run the risk\nof potentially filling up the hard drive\n\n1572\n01:20:17.150 --> 01:20:18.690\nand affecting the base OS.\n\n1573\n01:20:18.690 --> 01:20:21.750\nSo we could choose to branch\neach one of those out into their\n\n1574\n01:20:21.750 --> 01:20:26.320\nown separate partition to set\nlimits on their size if we want.\n\n1575\n01:20:26.320 --> 01:20:27.730\nWe can also use quotas to do it.\n\n1576\n01:20:27.730 --> 01:20:30.170\nWe'll see that later\non in another episode.\n\n1577\n01:20:30.170 --> 01:20:32.640\nBut we have that ability here, okay?\n\n1578\n01:20:32.640 --> 01:20:35.240\nThis is something you can\nchange after the fact.\n\n1579\n01:20:35.240 --> 01:20:38.780\nIt's not the easiest thing, you have to\ntake the server offline to do it, but\n\n1580\n01:20:38.780 --> 01:20:42.150\nyou can change it after\nthe fact if you want.\n\n1581\n01:20:42.150 --> 01:20:44.900\nBut, for right now, I'm just gonna\ngo all files in one partition,\n\n1582\n01:20:44.900 --> 01:20:47.135\nmainly cuz we haven't really learned\nabout those other folders yet.\n\n1583\n01:20:47.135 --> 01:20:48.607\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1584\n01:20:48.607 --> 01:20:50.506\nSo that swap file, so\n\n1585\n01:20:50.506 --> 01:20:54.324\nin Windows we call that paging file-\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1586\n01:20:54.324 --> 01:20:56.980\n>> And so then the swap file I guess\n>> Basically it\n\n1587\n01:20:56.980 --> 01:20:58.390\nwould just be the page file.\n\n1588\n01:20:58.390 --> 01:21:02.124\n>> Yeah, it's the same thing except in\nLinux, I kind of like the way they handle\n\n1589\n01:21:02.124 --> 01:21:04.434\nit better which is to give\nit its own partition.\n\n1590\n01:21:04.434 --> 01:21:07.613\nThat way it's not a file that shows up\non your hard drive, it's got a limit.\n\n1591\n01:21:07.613 --> 01:21:10.690\nYou don't have to worry about it growing\nand taking up too much space or whatever.\n\n1592\n01:21:10.690 --> 01:21:11.750\nIt's just a partition.\n\n1593\n01:21:11.750 --> 01:21:15.100\nIt's set off and it's smart about it\nbecause when it does the install,\n\n1594\n01:21:15.100 --> 01:21:18.570\nit'll actually put it towards\nthe beginning of the drive.\n\n1595\n01:21:18.570 --> 01:21:21.480\nAnd you always get better performance\nreading from the beginning\n\n1596\n01:21:21.480 --> 01:21:23.310\nof the drive and\ntowards the end of the drive.\n\n1597\n01:21:23.310 --> 01:21:25.804\nAnd so it has faster times and so on.\n\n1598\n01:21:25.804 --> 01:21:29.989\nIt's kind of a little more optimized\nthan the page file in Windows, right?\n\n1599\n01:21:29.989 --> 01:21:35.250\nAll right, so now it's just asking, is it\nokay to write those changes to the disk?\n\n1600\n01:21:35.250 --> 01:21:38.000\nSo it hasn't actually\nchanged my disk at all yet.\n\n1601\n01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:42.270\nWhen I go and say Yes though, it's gonna\nwipe out whatever I had on my hard drive.\n\n1602\n01:21:42.270 --> 01:21:44.110\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and say Yes.\n\n1603\n01:21:44.110 --> 01:21:47.245\nAnd now, if I had something\non the hard drive, it's gone.\n\n1604\n01:21:47.245 --> 01:21:51.460\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Okay, now it's ready to partition it,\n\n1605\n01:21:51.460 --> 01:21:53.900\nso I still have the chance\nto undo my partitions.\n\n1606\n01:21:53.900 --> 01:21:55.302\nBut it has already written\nto the boot sector.\n\n1607\n01:21:55.302 --> 01:21:56.831\nSo I've kind of lost whatever I had.\n\n1608\n01:21:56.831 --> 01:21:58.890\nAnd it's just showing what it's gonna do.\n\n1609\n01:21:58.890 --> 01:22:02.900\nAnd what I'll actually see in here is\nI'll see a couple of things twice.\n\n1610\n01:22:02.900 --> 01:22:08.610\nI can see for example, right here where\nit's creating two partitions, right?\n\n1611\n01:22:08.610 --> 01:22:15.440\nA primary partition that's 254 mb, and\na logical partition that's 21 gigs, okay?\n\n1612\n01:22:15.440 --> 01:22:19.550\nSo that primary one,\nthat's my boot partition, right?\n\n1613\n01:22:19.550 --> 01:22:23.210\nSo that's just got my boot files in it to\nbe able to get up and fire up Linux, so\n\n1614\n01:22:23.210 --> 01:22:24.260\nit doesn't need to be big.\n\n1615\n01:22:24.260 --> 01:22:26.240\n258 megs is fine.\n\n1616\n01:22:26.240 --> 01:22:28.910\nAnd the reason it's even that size\nis not because we need it but\n\n1617\n01:22:28.910 --> 01:22:31.520\nbecause it's part of UEFI compatibility.\n\n1618\n01:22:31.520 --> 01:22:35.650\nIf we want to be compatible\nwith the newer UEFI BIOS.\n\n1619\n01:22:35.650 --> 01:22:38.813\nAnd then logical 21 gigs,\nthat's just the rest of this hard drive.\n\n1620\n01:22:38.813 --> 01:22:42.282\nI think I did a 21 gig hard drive,\nit's like the default in VMware Fusion.\n\n1621\n01:22:42.282 --> 01:22:46.260\nSo that's the size of it and so\nit's got it flagged as LVM, or\n\n1622\n01:22:46.260 --> 01:22:49.170\nthe logical volume manager.\n\n1623\n01:22:49.170 --> 01:22:51.827\nYou'll see other things listed up above,\nright?\n\n1624\n01:22:51.827 --> 01:22:55.397\nSo here's this 20 gig partition\nwhich is the device mapper.\n\n1625\n01:22:55.397 --> 01:22:58.280\nSo that slash, that's my root folder.\n\n1626\n01:22:58.280 --> 01:23:00.210\nThat basically means my hard drive.\n\n1627\n01:23:00.210 --> 01:23:02.297\nAnd then I'll see a swap.\n\n1628\n01:23:02.297 --> 01:23:06.223\nIt created a 914 meg swap file.\n\n1629\n01:23:06.223 --> 01:23:07.454\nThat's pretty small.\n\n1630\n01:23:07.454 --> 01:23:08.648\nI wonder why it went that small.\n\n1631\n01:23:08.648 --> 01:23:11.160\nIt looks at your system and\nbases it on that.\n\n1632\n01:23:11.160 --> 01:23:14.747\nI forget, you know what,\nI only attached 2 gigs of memory.\n\n1633\n01:23:14.747 --> 01:23:16.149\nNo actually, you know what?\n\n1634\n01:23:16.149 --> 01:23:19.520\nI've only got 500 megs of memory attached\nto this VM, now that I think about it.\n\n1635\n01:23:19.520 --> 01:23:22.000\nAnd so it's doing double\nthe amount of my physical memory.\n\n1636\n01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:23.760\nSo that's where that number came from.\n\n1637\n01:23:23.760 --> 01:23:25.440\nSo it's got those.\n\n1638\n01:23:25.440 --> 01:23:27.450\nNow notice those are flagged as LVMs.\n\n1639\n01:23:27.450 --> 01:23:31.520\nThose are logical volumes laid\non top of the physical disk.\n\n1640\n01:23:31.520 --> 01:23:36.170\nAnd so on the physical disk, I just see\nboot and this one big logical volume.\n\n1641\n01:23:36.170 --> 01:23:39.980\nAnd that logical volume is then\ndiced up into these LVMs up here.\n\n1642\n01:23:39.980 --> 01:23:41.680\nSo that's why it looks a little different.\n\n1643\n01:23:41.680 --> 01:23:45.770\nIf I had chosen to do the normal install,\nthen it would've just done that on\n\n1644\n01:23:45.770 --> 01:23:47.790\nthe main disk and\nI wouldn't see these LVMs at all.\n\n1645\n01:23:47.790 --> 01:23:51.098\nAll right, so I'm gonna go ahead and\nfinish the partition and\n\n1646\n01:23:51.098 --> 01:23:52.120\nlet it write that.\n\n1647\n01:23:53.260 --> 01:23:57.060\nAnd so it just gives me a summary, and\nI'll say Yes, go ahead and write it.\n\n1648\n01:23:57.060 --> 01:23:59.320\nAnd from there,\nit's gonna create the partitions.\n\n1649\n01:23:59.320 --> 01:24:00.540\nSo that usually doesn't take long.\n\n1650\n01:24:00.540 --> 01:24:04.030\nIf you've got massive disks, if you've\ngot like a 6 terabyte RAID array,\n\n1651\n01:24:04.030 --> 01:24:07.120\nit might take a while to partition,\nbut it usually doesn't take that long.\n\n1652\n01:24:07.120 --> 01:24:10.040\nAnd when it's done,\nit's actually started the install.\n\n1653\n01:24:10.040 --> 01:24:13.020\nIt's installing the core\noperating system files right now.\n\n1654\n01:24:13.020 --> 01:24:17.360\nThese are files that you absolutely have\nto have if you want the system to turn on.\n\n1655\n01:24:17.360 --> 01:24:20.650\nIf you're missing any one of these files,\nsystem's not gonna work right.\n\n1656\n01:24:20.650 --> 01:24:22.777\nSo these are required ones.\n\n1657\n01:24:22.777 --> 01:24:25.495\nWhen this is done,\nit's gonna give me the option to\n\n1658\n01:24:25.495 --> 01:24:29.937\npick through some optional packages, some\nother things that I may or may not want.\n\n1659\n01:24:29.937 --> 01:24:31.490\nIt'll be my decision.\n\n1660\n01:24:31.490 --> 01:24:35.350\nThis part of the install should happen\npretty fast cuz the CoreOS is really only\n\n1661\n01:24:35.350 --> 01:24:36.353\na few hundred megs.\n\n1662\n01:24:36.353 --> 01:24:38.771\nI think it's like 300 megs in size,\nnot very big.\n\n1663\n01:24:38.771 --> 01:24:41.544\nAnd then when it's done,\nwe get to add in all the bloat,\n\n1664\n01:24:41.544 --> 01:24:43.030\nright [LAUGH] the other stuff.\n\n1665\n01:24:43.030 --> 01:24:46.000\nBut it may be bloat but\nit may be stuff that we need.\n\n1666\n01:24:47.070 --> 01:24:50.670\nAll right, so let's let this cruise,\nit's just gonna take a second longer and\n\n1667\n01:24:50.670 --> 01:24:53.110\nI wanna start the optional\nphase before we go to break.\n\n1668\n01:24:53.110 --> 01:24:55.230\nSo, we'll let it finish.\n\n1669\n01:24:55.230 --> 01:24:56.780\nThere we go.\n\n1670\n01:24:56.780 --> 01:24:58.540\nNow, it's doing something\nkind of important.\n\n1671\n01:24:58.540 --> 01:25:03.667\nIt scanned my DVD to see what packages\nI had available that were optional.\n\n1672\n01:25:03.667 --> 01:25:07.175\nIf I downloaded DVD number two and\nDVD number three,\n\n1673\n01:25:07.175 --> 01:25:10.533\nhere it gives me the chance\nto scan the other DVDs.\n\n1674\n01:25:10.533 --> 01:25:14.506\nAnd it's gonna build a package list\nof everything that's available.\n\n1675\n01:25:14.506 --> 01:25:16.260\nWell, I only have DVD number one.\n\n1676\n01:25:16.260 --> 01:25:18.410\nI don't bother with the other two.\n\n1677\n01:25:18.410 --> 01:25:20.800\nSo in my case,\nI don't need to scan anymore discs.\n\n1678\n01:25:20.800 --> 01:25:22.030\nSo on the next few screens,\n\n1679\n01:25:22.030 --> 01:25:26.756\nit's gonna give me choices based just\non what's available on disc one.\n\n1680\n01:25:26.756 --> 01:25:28.696\nIf I feed it disc two and disc three,\n\n1681\n01:25:28.696 --> 01:25:32.266\nit'll then have additional choices\nwhen I go and do the install.\n\n1682\n01:25:32.266 --> 01:25:34.627\nBut you'll see,\nit's got pretty much everything I need.\n\n1683\n01:25:34.627 --> 01:25:36.671\nSo, I'll say No there.\n\n1684\n01:25:36.671 --> 01:25:41.420\nIt also asks do we want to reach out\nto a network mirror to make sure we get\n\n1685\n01:25:41.420 --> 01:25:43.527\nthe latest packages and so on.\n\n1686\n01:25:43.527 --> 01:25:46.502\nNormally I might do that, but\nit's gonna slow down my install and\n\n1687\n01:25:46.502 --> 01:25:49.277\nI want this install to happen\nin a reasonable amount of time.\n\n1688\n01:25:49.277 --> 01:25:50.432\nSo, I'm gonna say no.\n\n1689\n01:25:50.432 --> 01:25:53.410\nThat's gonna tell it to use the DVD for\nthe install.\n\n1690\n01:25:53.410 --> 01:25:55.602\nWhen I'm done,\nI can always update off of the Internet.\n\n1691\n01:25:55.602 --> 01:25:56.796\nAnd that's exactly what I'll do.\n\n1692\n01:25:58.297 --> 01:26:01.403\nAll right, so\nnow it's just building its file list, and\n\n1693\n01:26:01.403 --> 01:26:04.790\nthen I'll get to choose from\nmy software groups, all right?\n\n1694\n01:26:04.790 --> 01:26:08.030\nSoftware groups are collections\nof software based on\n\n1695\n01:26:08.030 --> 01:26:09.940\nwhat it is we plan on doing.\n\n1696\n01:26:09.940 --> 01:26:11.380\nAre we gonna be a server?\n\n1697\n01:26:11.380 --> 01:26:12.383\nAre we gonna be a desktop?\n\n1698\n01:26:12.383 --> 01:26:13.521\nAre we a laptop?\n\n1699\n01:26:13.521 --> 01:26:15.220\nAre we gonna be a web server?\n\n1700\n01:26:15.220 --> 01:26:16.870\nYou pick these groups and\n\n1701\n01:26:16.870 --> 01:26:20.280\nthere's packages of software\nthat correlates with that group.\n\n1702\n01:26:20.280 --> 01:26:23.670\nAll right, if you've got a special\nuse case that doesn't fit\n\n1703\n01:26:23.670 --> 01:26:28.020\nany of the group descriptions, then you'll\nwanna do what's called a minimal install.\n\n1704\n01:26:28.020 --> 01:26:30.040\nA minimal install says\njust give me the core and\n\n1705\n01:26:30.040 --> 01:26:32.720\nI'll add what I need afterwards,\nall right?\n\n1706\n01:26:32.720 --> 01:26:35.440\nThat way,\nyou basically build your own group.\n\n1707\n01:26:35.440 --> 01:26:38.260\nBut if you fit the scenario\nlisted on the screen,\n\n1708\n01:26:38.260 --> 01:26:42.040\nyou can pick one of the default groups,\nand then that'll knock it out for you.\n\n1709\n01:26:42.040 --> 01:26:45.240\nSo we'll see that option\nas soon as this is done,\n\n1710\n01:26:45.240 --> 01:26:48.730\nwhich when the install winds down,\nyou're gonna get a pop-up\n\n1711\n01:26:48.730 --> 01:26:52.350\nbox talking about the popularity contest\nand there, see, mine's already come up.\n\n1712\n01:26:52.350 --> 01:26:54.340\nThe popularity contest,\nkind of a funny name.\n\n1713\n01:26:54.340 --> 01:26:57.642\nWhat it's talking about is Debian,\nthe developers,\n\n1714\n01:26:57.642 --> 01:27:01.034\nthey like to track which\npackages are the most popular.\n\n1715\n01:27:01.034 --> 01:27:03.878\nSo if a lot of people are using a package,\nthey make sure that it\n\n1716\n01:27:03.878 --> 01:27:07.674\nstays in the base OS and that it's getting\nits updates and it's staying current.\n\n1717\n01:27:07.674 --> 01:27:11.299\nAnd if a package is not popular,\nif a lot of people are not installing it,\n\n1718\n01:27:11.299 --> 01:27:13.180\nthen they'll stop supporting it.\n\n1719\n01:27:13.180 --> 01:27:16.100\nSo they free up resources to\nmove them where they're needed.\n\n1720\n01:27:16.100 --> 01:27:18.920\nThe popularity contest\ncontinues beyond the install.\n\n1721\n01:27:18.920 --> 01:27:20.750\nIt's tracking what\npackages you install and\n\n1722\n01:27:20.750 --> 01:27:23.250\nreporting those,\nanonymously back to Debian.\n\n1723\n01:27:23.250 --> 01:27:24.940\nYou don't want that, you just say No.\n\n1724\n01:27:24.940 --> 01:27:28.510\nBut if you say Yes, it does help the\ndevelopers to better tailor the product to\n\n1725\n01:27:28.510 --> 01:27:29.720\nmeet the people's needs.\n\n1726\n01:27:29.720 --> 01:27:32.310\nI'm gonna say No for now, just cuz I\nknow I'm gonna delete this machine.\n\n1727\n01:27:32.310 --> 01:27:35.182\nNormally, I would say Yes.\n\n1728\n01:27:35.182 --> 01:27:37.944\nAll right, now I get my software groups.\n\n1729\n01:27:37.944 --> 01:27:41.621\nSo here I get to pick between the\ndifferent packages of software that I want\n\n1730\n01:27:41.621 --> 01:27:45.793\nIf I'm installing this on a desktop, I may\nwant that to be in desktop environment.\n\n1731\n01:27:45.793 --> 01:27:49.470\nIt gives me a full GUI,\nOpen Office, things like that.\n\n1732\n01:27:49.470 --> 01:27:51.360\nSo, it's much easier to use.\n\n1733\n01:27:51.360 --> 01:27:53.990\nBut, if I'm setting up a server,\nI probably don't want that.\n\n1734\n01:27:53.990 --> 01:27:54.510\nRight?\n\n1735\n01:27:54.510 --> 01:27:56.716\nAnd, [SOUND] I know I've said\nit because for the exam,\n\n1736\n01:27:56.716 --> 01:27:58.544\nwe wanna learn the command line interface.\n\n1737\n01:27:58.544 --> 01:28:01.080\nI'm gonna leave the GUI off, all right.\n\n1738\n01:28:01.080 --> 01:28:02.960\nIt's also gonna make my\ninstall a little faster.\n\n1739\n01:28:02.960 --> 01:28:04.585\nSo, I'm gonna turn off print server also.\n\n1740\n01:28:04.585 --> 01:28:08.500\nCuz the only thing I'm installing\nis the standard system utilities.\n\n1741\n01:28:08.500 --> 01:28:10.210\nThose are command lines utilities and\n\n1742\n01:28:10.210 --> 01:28:12.910\nthings that we need to be able\nto work within the system.\n\n1743\n01:28:12.910 --> 01:28:15.380\nThey're not required, but\nit's nice to have them.\n\n1744\n01:28:15.380 --> 01:28:17.740\nSo, here we expect to have a text editor.\n\n1745\n01:28:17.740 --> 01:28:19.920\nThe operating system\ndoes need a text editor,\n\n1746\n01:28:19.920 --> 01:28:22.340\nthe user could use one if\nyou wanna modify files.\n\n1747\n01:28:22.340 --> 01:28:26.133\nSo, that's the kind of stuff that\nin this Standard System Utilities.\n\n1748\n01:28:26.133 --> 01:28:29.395\nIf you don't wanna any of the stuff, you\ncan choose to turn them off and then you\n\n1749\n01:28:29.395 --> 01:28:32.677\ncan manually add the packages you want\nlater, we'll get a chance to see that.\n\n1750\n01:28:32.677 --> 01:28:36.470\nBecause some of these software groups\nmight not match up with what you need.\n\n1751\n01:28:36.470 --> 01:28:39.100\nMaybe, you're creating some\nkind of specialized server and\n\n1752\n01:28:39.100 --> 01:28:41.170\nthese just don't fit your description.\n\n1753\n01:28:41.170 --> 01:28:43.095\nYou can also check off\nmore than one of these.\n\n1754\n01:28:43.095 --> 01:28:46.669\nSo, you might wanna have a desktop\nthat's also an SQL server so\n\n1755\n01:28:46.669 --> 01:28:50.320\nyou can run your own My SQL databases for\ndevelopment purposes.\n\n1756\n01:28:50.320 --> 01:28:51.579\nSo, you can do that,\nyou can mix and match.\n\n1757\n01:28:53.570 --> 01:28:56.720\nAll right, you've also got Laptop\nwhich adds battery support for\n\n1758\n01:28:56.720 --> 01:28:58.850\ndoing power management with a battery.\n\n1759\n01:28:58.850 --> 01:29:01.592\nOn a desktop or a server,\nyou don't have a battery, so\n\n1760\n01:29:01.592 --> 01:29:03.694\nthat's not normally something we need.\n\n1761\n01:29:03.694 --> 01:29:05.745\nAll right, I'll go ahead and\ncontinue from there and now,\n\n1762\n01:29:05.745 --> 01:29:07.720\nI'm just gonna move on with the install.\n\n1763\n01:29:07.720 --> 01:29:09.760\nIt's not installing\na whole ton of packages,\n\n1764\n01:29:09.760 --> 01:29:14.020\nyou'll see 121 packages there cuz I\nchose a real minimal installation.\n\n1765\n01:29:14.020 --> 01:29:17.805\nIf I had chosen the full shebang, this\ncould take 20 minutes, because it copies\n\n1766\n01:29:17.805 --> 01:29:20.675\nall that data but you will see right here\nit finishes in probably about a minute and\n\n1767\n01:29:20.675 --> 01:29:23.675\na half just because it is\nmoving those few packages.\n\n1768\n01:29:23.675 --> 01:29:27.955\nWhen it's done, it's gonna tell me, hey,\ngreat, you've installed, time to reboot.\n\n1769\n01:29:27.955 --> 01:29:32.290\nAnd when we reboot, we just take the DVD\nout of the drive if it's a physical one.\n\n1770\n01:29:32.290 --> 01:29:34.920\nIf it's a virtual machine like this,\nit'll automatically do it.\n\n1771\n01:29:34.920 --> 01:29:38.193\nAnd then when it reboots,\nit's gonna try and boot from Debian.\n\n1772\n01:29:38.193 --> 01:29:42.620\nNow, in order to boot, it's gotta be\nable to find the operating system.\n\n1773\n01:29:42.620 --> 01:29:45.920\nAnd the way we find an operating system\nis by using a boot loader and so\n\n1774\n01:29:45.920 --> 01:29:49.710\nthat's what I'm gonna get prompted for\nnext is the grub boot loader.\n\n1775\n01:29:49.710 --> 01:29:52.200\nNow, every operating\nsystem uses a boot loader.\n\n1776\n01:29:52.200 --> 01:29:54.664\nWindows has their own called NT loader.\n\n1777\n01:29:54.664 --> 01:29:57.966\nNo, now it's called BC, it's doesnt mater,\nit's called something stupid.\n\n1778\n01:29:57.966 --> 01:30:00.935\nAnd [LAUGH] OSX has their own boot loader,\n\n1779\n01:30:00.935 --> 01:30:04.260\nwhich I can't remember\nthe name of offhand.\n\n1780\n01:30:04.260 --> 01:30:06.180\nEither it's something strange.\n\n1781\n01:30:06.180 --> 01:30:08.322\nBut anyhow,\nthey've got their own boot loaders.\n\n1782\n01:30:08.322 --> 01:30:12.590\nIn the Linux world, the most common\nboot loader is the grub boot loader.\n\n1783\n01:30:12.590 --> 01:30:16.490\nAnd, what it does, is it allows\nus to boot Linux distributions.\n\n1784\n01:30:16.490 --> 01:30:20.350\nIt also allows us to\nchainload other boot loaders.\n\n1785\n01:30:20.350 --> 01:30:24.820\nSo, you could actually set up a dual boot\nsystem, where it can boot up to GRUB.\n\n1786\n01:30:24.820 --> 01:30:27.110\nGRUB can show you your Linux install.\n\n1787\n01:30:27.110 --> 01:30:30.880\nAnd, then it can show the Windows\ninstaller actually by calling the Windows\n\n1788\n01:30:30.880 --> 01:30:31.870\ninstall's boot loaders.\n\n1789\n01:30:31.870 --> 01:30:33.780\nSo, a boot loader can call a boot loader.\n\n1790\n01:30:33.780 --> 01:30:34.940\nIt's kinda neat.\n\n1791\n01:30:34.940 --> 01:30:37.446\nBut you can dual boot Windows and\nLinux if you want.\n\n1792\n01:30:37.446 --> 01:30:39.507\nThere's, I guess some\npeople who want that.\n\n1793\n01:30:39.507 --> 01:30:45.354\nBut, [LAUGH] I typically stay\naway from dual boot systems.\n\n1794\n01:30:45.354 --> 01:30:48.460\n>> All right, now, it doesn't say\nit anywhere on here, let's see.\n\n1795\n01:30:48.460 --> 01:30:50.262\nIt doesn't specifically call it out, but\n\n1796\n01:30:50.262 --> 01:30:53.323\nthe version of Grub that it's installing\nis actually Grub version two.\n\n1797\n01:30:53.323 --> 01:30:55.689\nThere is the older version\nof Grub that's out there,\n\n1798\n01:30:55.689 --> 01:30:57.749\nif you have older systems\nthat you might need.\n\n1799\n01:30:57.749 --> 01:31:01.340\nOne of the big difference is that Grub\nversion two is what gives us full support\n\n1800\n01:31:01.340 --> 01:31:03.174\nfor LVM, the logical volume manager.\n\n1801\n01:31:03.174 --> 01:31:06.670\nSo, we need that because we\ndid an LVM based install.\n\n1802\n01:31:06.670 --> 01:31:09.286\n>> And,\nthat older version of the GRUB Legacy.\n\n1803\n01:31:09.286 --> 01:31:10.058\n>> That's right.\nYap.\n\n1804\n01:31:10.058 --> 01:31:11.437\n>> GRUB Legacy,\nthat's what the guys call it.\n\n1805\n01:31:11.437 --> 01:31:12.927\n>> Yeah.\nCuz they didn't call version one\n\n1806\n01:31:12.927 --> 01:31:14.509\nwhen it was the only\nthing that was out there.\n\n1807\n01:31:14.509 --> 01:31:16.325\n[LAUGH] All right, so\nI'm gonna go ahead and\n\n1808\n01:31:16.325 --> 01:31:19.075\nsay yes to this to let it\ninstall the boot loader.\n\n1809\n01:31:19.075 --> 01:31:21.565\nIf I said no,\nwhat I'm basically telling it is,\n\n1810\n01:31:21.565 --> 01:31:24.155\nno, I've already got some other\nboot loader that I wanna use.\n\n1811\n01:31:24.155 --> 01:31:25.155\nAnd my next step would be,\n\n1812\n01:31:25.155 --> 01:31:28.697\nI'd need to go and edit my existing\nboot loader to add this install.\n\n1813\n01:31:28.697 --> 01:31:32.481\nOtherwise, when I reboot,\nit won't find my installation, all right?\n\n1814\n01:31:32.481 --> 01:31:33.752\nBut since we installed it,\n\n1815\n01:31:33.752 --> 01:31:36.804\nit's gonna reboot right here\nthat's what that last prompt was.\n\n1816\n01:31:36.804 --> 01:31:39.895\nAnd now, when it boots up,\nit's not booting from the DVD anymore,\n\n1817\n01:31:39.895 --> 01:31:42.030\nnow it's booting from my hard drive.\n\n1818\n01:31:42.030 --> 01:31:45.560\nAnd I can see,\nI've got my two OSes installed there.\n\n1819\n01:31:46.580 --> 01:31:50.510\nIt picks the default one automatically\nif we don't choose anything.\n\n1820\n01:31:50.510 --> 01:31:53.610\nIf I had,\nthe second option was a repair mode.\n\n1821\n01:31:53.610 --> 01:31:57.830\nIf something goes wrong, if my system's\nnot booting, if I have some kind of issue,\n\n1822\n01:31:57.830 --> 01:32:01.650\nI can go into that recovery setting, that\nrepair mode, and it gives me a specialized\n\n1823\n01:32:01.650 --> 01:32:04.630\nboot system that gives me the tools\nto be able to try and fix it.\n\n1824\n01:32:04.630 --> 01:32:07.550\nSo, we'll see that in another episode.\n\n1825\n01:32:07.550 --> 01:32:09.980\nBut if everything went right, here we are.\n\n1826\n01:32:09.980 --> 01:32:11.785\nWe're dropped to a login prompt.\n\n1827\n01:32:11.785 --> 01:32:14.540\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Now, I didn't install a GUI.\n\n1828\n01:32:14.540 --> 01:32:18.730\nSo, I get a straight up text based\nlogin prompt and that's it, here I am,\n\n1829\n01:32:18.730 --> 01:32:19.940\ngood luck done, all right.\n\n1830\n01:32:21.040 --> 01:32:24.160\nHad I chosen the desktop one though,\nI get a nice little GUI and\n\n1831\n01:32:24.160 --> 01:32:27.884\nI actually got that in another window\nsomewhere around here, here we go.\n\n1832\n01:32:27.884 --> 01:32:32.040\nSo, had I installed the GUI when I boot\nup, this is what I would see, right?\n\n1833\n01:32:32.040 --> 01:32:34.190\nA nice little graphical user interface.\n\n1834\n01:32:34.190 --> 01:32:39.090\nI pick my user, I punch in my password,\nand when I log in,\n\n1835\n01:32:39.090 --> 01:32:44.165\nhere I am and let's see and\nGNOME fails to load.\n\n1836\n01:32:44.165 --> 01:32:48.300\n[LAUGH] I think I've got my resolution too\nlow since I'm in a virtual machine but\n\n1837\n01:32:48.300 --> 01:32:51.840\nyou'll see it's nice and graphical,\nso I can get in here and\n\n1838\n01:32:51.840 --> 01:32:56.420\ndo work without having to know system\ncommands and all that stuff right.\n\n1839\n01:32:56.420 --> 01:32:59.330\nBut, on the exam,\nwe're not messing with the GUI.\n\n1840\n01:32:59.330 --> 01:33:03.347\nWe're messing with the command line and\nso instead,\n\n1841\n01:33:03.347 --> 01:33:08.177\nwe get logged in with the account\nwe created and then here we are.\n\n1842\n01:33:08.177 --> 01:33:08.929\nWhat do you do next?\n\n1843\n01:33:08.929 --> 01:33:10.110\nRight?\n\n1844\n01:33:10.110 --> 01:33:12.650\nWell, it may look like\nthe install is done,\n\n1845\n01:33:12.650 --> 01:33:16.860\nbut I never consider the installation\ndone until we do the available updates.\n\n1846\n01:33:16.860 --> 01:33:18.740\nI wanna get this system up-to-date.\n\n1847\n01:33:18.740 --> 01:33:20.190\nSo, what I wanna do is\nI wanna go ahead and\n\n1848\n01:33:20.190 --> 01:33:24.490\nstop and take a break here, and when we\nget back, we're gonna take a look at how\n\n1849\n01:33:24.490 --> 01:33:28.710\nto update our system to bring it current,\nand then the install is done.\n\n1850\n01:33:28.710 --> 01:33:30.610\nAnd we'll wrap the show up there.\n\n1851\n01:33:30.610 --> 01:33:33.510\nBut after that,\nin our followup shows, we're gonna\n\n1852\n01:33:33.510 --> 01:33:37.699\ngo into all our various commands,\nhow we work in the command line interface,\n\n1853\n01:33:37.699 --> 01:33:41.513\nhow we actually do things inside of Linux,\nnot just stare at a prompt.\n\n1854\n01:33:41.513 --> 01:33:42.837\nAll right, so stay tuned.\n\n1855\n01:33:42.837 --> 01:33:45.600\nWe'll be back in just a few\nminutes with system updates.\n\n1856\n01:33:45.600 --> 01:33:50.778\n[MUSIC]\n\n1857\n01:33:53.448 --> 01:33:55.080\nAll right, welcome back everybody.\n\n1858\n01:33:55.080 --> 01:33:59.182\nSo, now that I've got my copy of Debian up\nand running, I need to get it up to date,\n\n1859\n01:33:59.182 --> 01:34:02.687\nand if you install the GUI, you get\na nice little pop up box that appears\n\n1860\n01:34:02.687 --> 01:34:06.149\nthat says update your system and\nyou click a button and you're done.\n\n1861\n01:34:06.149 --> 01:34:09.096\nBut, for the exam, we need to know\nhow to do it from the command line.\n\n1862\n01:34:09.096 --> 01:34:12.650\nBecause on a server, you're typically\nnot going to have GUI, all right?\n\n1863\n01:34:12.650 --> 01:34:16.500\nNow, there's two sets of commands we\nreally need to be aware of in Debian for\n\n1864\n01:34:16.500 --> 01:34:17.350\ndoing our updates.\n\n1865\n01:34:19.070 --> 01:34:22.940\nEach distribution has different\nupdate software that it uses.\n\n1866\n01:34:22.940 --> 01:34:25.883\nAnd this is one place where we really\nget deviation between the OSes.\n\n1867\n01:34:25.883 --> 01:34:29.762\nSo, if you're running CentOS, for\nexample, and in the Red Hat OSes,\n\n1868\n01:34:29.762 --> 01:34:34.540\nthey have one set of commands they use for\nupdates, Debian has a different one.\n\n1869\n01:34:34.540 --> 01:34:37.390\nSo in the Debian world,\nthe main command we're gonna use for\n\n1870\n01:34:37.390 --> 01:34:41.315\nupdates is the apt-get command, all right?\n\n1871\n01:34:41.315 --> 01:34:44.780\napt-get is what's gonna let us go out and\nget our application updates and\n\n1872\n01:34:44.780 --> 01:34:46.740\npull them down to our system.\n\n1873\n01:34:46.740 --> 01:34:49.970\nThere is an older command that\nis still supported though,\n\n1874\n01:34:49.970 --> 01:34:54.300\nwhich is the dpkg or\nDebian package command.\n\n1875\n01:34:54.300 --> 01:34:56.800\nAnd that allows us to also do updates.\n\n1876\n01:34:56.800 --> 01:34:59.939\nBut, it's not as flexible as apt-get, and\n\n1877\n01:34:59.939 --> 01:35:03.830\nso you're almost entirely\nusing apt-get these days.\n\n1878\n01:35:03.830 --> 01:35:05.780\nSo, typically,\nthat's the one you wanna learn.\n\n1879\n01:35:05.780 --> 01:35:08.690\nFor the exam,\nit's probably a good idea to learn both.\n\n1880\n01:35:08.690 --> 01:35:11.510\nSo, let me show you how they work,\nwhat they do, and how to go from there.\n\n1881\n01:35:11.510 --> 01:35:16.710\nNow, one thing I do wanna point out is,\nI logged in at dpizet.\n\n1882\n01:35:16.710 --> 01:35:19.820\nAnd that was the regular user\naccount that was created for\n\n1883\n01:35:19.820 --> 01:35:21.720\nme when I installed this machine.\n\n1884\n01:35:21.720 --> 01:35:26.110\nThe regular user doesn't have\npermission to update the system.\n\n1885\n01:35:26.110 --> 01:35:28.827\nSo, I need to log in as a user\nthat does have permission.\n\n1886\n01:35:28.827 --> 01:35:33.499\nAnd, in the security episode, we're gonna\nsee the way that we should normally handle\n\n1887\n01:35:33.499 --> 01:35:37.019\nthis, but I'm gonna do something\nthat I wouldn't normally do,\n\n1888\n01:35:37.019 --> 01:35:39.918\nwhich is basically to log in\nas root to do the updates.\n\n1889\n01:35:39.918 --> 01:35:42.039\nThe root user has permission to do it.\n\n1890\n01:35:42.039 --> 01:35:45.715\nAnd we typically try to avoid logging in\nas root cuz you don't wanna transmit that\n\n1891\n01:35:45.715 --> 01:35:47.632\npassword across the network, and so on.\n\n1892\n01:35:47.632 --> 01:35:51.912\nWell I'm on the local console this\nmachine, I'm sitting at this machine.\n\n1893\n01:35:51.912 --> 01:35:55.280\nSo it's pretty safe to go ahead and\nswitch over to root.\n\n1894\n01:35:55.280 --> 01:36:00.256\nI'm gonna do that by using a command\ncalled su, that's the superuser command.\n\n1895\n01:36:00.256 --> 01:36:03.679\nAnd it basically says yeah,\nI'm logged in as a regular user, but\n\n1896\n01:36:03.679 --> 01:36:07.802\nI want you to bump me up to somebody with\nhigh privileges in other words, root.\n\n1897\n01:36:07.802 --> 01:36:13.622\nAnd when you do that, it's going to ask\nfor the root password which I'll provide\n\n1898\n01:36:13.622 --> 01:36:19.285\nand I'll know that I am now a super user\nif my prompt changes from a dollar sign.\n\n1899\n01:36:19.285 --> 01:36:23.116\nDollar sign means regular\nuser to a pound or hash mark,\n\n1900\n01:36:23.116 --> 01:36:25.510\nthat means you are a super user.\n\n1901\n01:36:25.510 --> 01:36:28.280\nSo I know that I'm now root, and\n\n1902\n01:36:28.280 --> 01:36:30.170\nI can do things that I wouldn't\nnormally be able to do.\n\n1903\n01:36:31.740 --> 01:36:33.300\nSo the first thing that I wanna do,\n\n1904\n01:36:33.300 --> 01:36:36.380\nis I wanna find out whether\nmy system is up to date.\n\n1905\n01:36:36.380 --> 01:36:38.564\nAnd to do that, I'm gonna use apt-get.\n\n1906\n01:36:38.564 --> 01:36:40.931\nAnd I'm about to type out\na bunch of different commands,\n\n1907\n01:36:40.931 --> 01:36:42.569\nwe'll post these with the show notes.\n\n1908\n01:36:42.569 --> 01:36:44.803\nSo that you guys have them, so\nthat you don't have to sit here,\n\n1909\n01:36:44.803 --> 01:36:47.724\nwell you can jot them down if you want but\nwe'll post them right with the video too.\n\n1910\n01:36:47.724 --> 01:36:50.261\nSo app-get, that's the command we want and\n\n1911\n01:36:50.261 --> 01:36:54.147\nif you run it by itself you actually\nget the little help output for it.\n\n1912\n01:36:54.147 --> 01:36:56.743\nAnd so you'll see some of\nthe different extensions,\n\n1913\n01:36:56.743 --> 01:37:00.290\nthe modifiers that you can use to\nchange the way that it behaves.\n\n1914\n01:37:00.290 --> 01:37:04.490\nBut there's really just a handful\nthat we wanna be aware of.\n\n1915\n01:37:04.490 --> 01:37:10.773\nThe first one is probably the most\nimportant, which is apt-get update.\n\n1916\n01:37:10.773 --> 01:37:16.689\nApt-get maintains a local database of all\nof the packages you have installed and\n\n1917\n01:37:16.689 --> 01:37:18.870\nwhat updates are available.\n\n1918\n01:37:19.880 --> 01:37:23.849\nWhen you run apt-get update,\nit's not actually updating or\n\n1919\n01:37:23.849 --> 01:37:25.689\nnot updating the packages.\n\n1920\n01:37:25.689 --> 01:37:27.756\nWhat it's doing is updating your database.\n\n1921\n01:37:27.756 --> 01:37:30.462\nIt is reaching out to\nthe debian servers and saying,\n\n1922\n01:37:30.462 --> 01:37:33.620\nwhat's the current version\nof all these packages?\n\n1923\n01:37:33.620 --> 01:37:35.990\nAnd then it loads it into your database.\n\n1924\n01:37:35.990 --> 01:37:39.138\nSo you can compare to figure\nout what updates are available.\n\n1925\n01:37:39.138 --> 01:37:43.900\nSo app-get update doesn't update\nthe packages themselves, it just\n\n1926\n01:37:43.900 --> 01:37:49.130\nupdates your local store of information\nto tell you which updates are available.\n\n1927\n01:37:49.130 --> 01:37:55.270\nSo let me just to kind of keep this clean,\nlet me reset my screen.\n\n1928\n01:37:55.270 --> 01:37:58.900\nSo I'm gonna run apt-get update.\n\n1929\n01:37:58.900 --> 01:38:02.896\nSo it's gonna reach out to the Debian\nservers, and it reaches out across\n\n1930\n01:38:02.896 --> 01:38:07.237\nthe Internet and it connects to them and\nit says, I'm running Debian 7.5.\n\n1931\n01:38:07.237 --> 01:38:11.180\nAnd it goes and it gathers a list\nof the updates that are available.\n\n1932\n01:38:11.180 --> 01:38:12.960\nSo it's reaching out and\npulling those, and\n\n1933\n01:38:12.960 --> 01:38:17.970\nyou'll see here where it's getting\nthe updates for the main amd64 packages.\n\n1934\n01:38:17.970 --> 01:38:22.260\nThey contributed sources and so\non, it's pulling all that in and\n\n1935\n01:38:22.260 --> 01:38:24.211\nnow my database is up to date.\n\n1936\n01:38:24.211 --> 01:38:27.535\nMy packages might still be behind though,\nso\n\n1937\n01:38:27.535 --> 01:38:30.689\nI need to actually do the software update.\n\n1938\n01:38:30.689 --> 01:38:35.707\nSo I typically follow apt-get update\n\n1939\n01:38:35.707 --> 01:38:41.988\nby another command which\nis apt-get upgrade.\n\n1940\n01:38:41.988 --> 01:38:46.182\nApt-get upgrade will actually\nperform the upgrades for\n\n1941\n01:38:46.182 --> 01:38:50.209\nall of my packages to bring\nthem to the latest version.\n\n1942\n01:38:50.209 --> 01:38:54.319\nSo when I do a new install,\nthese are the first two commands I run.\n\n1943\n01:38:54.319 --> 01:38:57.976\nApp-get update followed\nby app-get upgrade.\n\n1944\n01:38:57.976 --> 01:39:02.050\nSo if I were to run that,\nthat would upgrade them all and\n\n1945\n01:39:02.050 --> 01:39:03.858\nthings would be great.\n\n1946\n01:39:03.858 --> 01:39:08.380\nWell, there are a few other things we\nneeded to be aware of before I run this.\n\n1947\n01:39:08.380 --> 01:39:11.010\nThere's actually two variations\nof the upgrade command.\n\n1948\n01:39:11.010 --> 01:39:14.370\nApp-get upgrade, we'll look for\n\n1949\n01:39:14.370 --> 01:39:20.090\nindividual packages and\nupgrade them and it will never\n\n1950\n01:39:20.090 --> 01:39:25.340\nunder any circumstances remove a package\nthat you've already got installed.\n\n1951\n01:39:25.340 --> 01:39:28.271\nNow you might ask yourself,\nwhy would we do that?\n\n1952\n01:39:28.271 --> 01:39:29.490\nWhy would we remove one?\n\n1953\n01:39:29.490 --> 01:39:33.634\nWell a lot of times one package\nwill depend on another package,\n\n1954\n01:39:33.634 --> 01:39:36.850\nwhich may in turn depend\non another one and so on.\n\n1955\n01:39:36.850 --> 01:39:37.670\nYou have these dependencies,\n\n1956\n01:39:37.670 --> 01:39:43.050\nand when you upgrade one the dependency\non that other package might go away.\n\n1957\n01:39:43.050 --> 01:39:46.950\nWe don't need it anymore, and so you could\ntechnically remove that other package.\n\n1958\n01:39:46.950 --> 01:39:47.920\nYou don't need it anymore.\n\n1959\n01:39:48.960 --> 01:39:51.720\nWell when you do apt-get upgrade,\nit doesn't do that.\n\n1960\n01:39:51.720 --> 01:39:54.030\nIt never removes a package.\n\n1961\n01:39:54.030 --> 01:39:56.310\nIf you wanted to go ahead and\nremove packages,\n\n1962\n01:39:56.310 --> 01:39:58.690\nto actually just bring it current and\nremove things.\n\n1963\n01:39:58.690 --> 01:39:59.330\nWell first off,\n\n1964\n01:39:59.330 --> 01:40:01.830\nyou need to know what you're doing\ncuz you run the risk of breaking\n\n1965\n01:40:01.830 --> 01:40:04.090\nother software that might\nbe dependent on it.\n\n1966\n01:40:04.090 --> 01:40:07.650\nBut you can modify this\ncommand slightly and say,\n\n1967\n01:40:07.650 --> 01:40:12.020\napt-get dist-upgrade or\ndistribution upgrade.\n\n1968\n01:40:12.020 --> 01:40:16.572\nThat's going to update your packages and\nany dependencies that have been remove,\n\n1969\n01:40:16.572 --> 01:40:19.640\nit will remove those packages and\nget them out of there.\n\n1970\n01:40:19.640 --> 01:40:22.759\nSo if you stayed on the straight and\nnarrow with installing your packages and\n\n1971\n01:40:22.759 --> 01:40:26.360\nthey have all come from the BM library,\nthat's perfectly safe to do.\n\n1972\n01:40:26.360 --> 01:40:30.900\nBut if you've installed third\nparty applications not from the BM\n\n1973\n01:40:30.900 --> 01:40:36.570\ndistribution library, then this\ncould break some of your software.\n\n1974\n01:40:36.570 --> 01:40:39.560\nSo you just need to evaluate\nwhat's right for your environment.\n\n1975\n01:40:39.560 --> 01:40:43.900\nBecause I just did a clean install,\neither command will work fine for me.\n\n1976\n01:40:43.900 --> 01:40:45.980\nSo I could run either one and\nit would do the full upgrade.\n\n1977\n01:40:47.370 --> 01:40:51.175\nThe other thing is,\nI don't have to update the whole OS,\n\n1978\n01:40:51.175 --> 01:40:55.074\nI could update just a very\nparticular package if I wanted.\n\n1979\n01:40:55.074 --> 01:40:58.633\nIf there was one package in\nparticular that I wanted to update,\n\n1980\n01:40:58.633 --> 01:41:02.560\nI could reach out and check for\nupdates on it and do the update.\n\n1981\n01:41:02.560 --> 01:41:07.570\nSo for example, I could say, app-get and\n\n1982\n01:41:09.060 --> 01:41:11.930\ninstall, and\nthen a particular package name.\n\n1983\n01:41:11.930 --> 01:41:13.610\nIf I wanted to have something.\n\n1984\n01:41:13.610 --> 01:41:15.687\nLet's see do I have vim?\n\n1985\n01:41:15.687 --> 01:41:16.673\nNo.\n\n1986\n01:41:16.673 --> 01:41:20.719\nSo vim is a text editor, and\nmaybe I really want that text editor and\n\n1987\n01:41:20.719 --> 01:41:21.740\nit's not here.\n\n1988\n01:41:21.740 --> 01:41:29.260\nI can say at-get install vim, and it'll\nreach out and it'll find that package.\n\n1989\n01:41:29.260 --> 01:41:32.090\nSo it found one, the vim runtime.\n\n1990\n01:41:32.090 --> 01:41:34.170\nAnd I can yes, and\nit's going to install it.\n\n1991\n01:41:34.170 --> 01:41:38.690\nSo that's gonna install and it's\nactually listening to my DVD so shoot,\n\n1992\n01:41:38.690 --> 01:41:40.206\nI need to put that back in.\n\n1993\n01:41:42.621 --> 01:41:47.833\nIt didn't go out to the Internet for\nme and now it does, there we go.\n\n1994\n01:41:47.833 --> 01:41:50.573\nLet me pop that CD back in the drive.\n\n1995\n01:41:55.045 --> 01:41:57.739\nWe'll give that just a second.\n\n1996\n01:41:57.739 --> 01:42:00.479\nAnd there we go.\n\n1997\n01:42:00.479 --> 01:42:02.848\nSo it's gonna find it,\nit's there on the DVD.\n\n1998\n01:42:02.848 --> 01:42:04.530\nI just didn't install it and\nit's gonna pull it in.\n\n1999\n01:42:04.530 --> 01:42:08.697\nNow notice when it goes to install it,\nit's actually installing several different\n\n2000\n01:42:08.697 --> 01:42:12.349\nthings not just vim, and that's\nbecause vim depends on other packages.\n\n2001\n01:42:12.349 --> 01:42:18.366\nSo it's getting them installing it and\nI should now have vim, and I sure do.\n\n2002\n01:42:18.366 --> 01:42:23.013\nSo to install one package,\nwe can do that then we can do app-get,\n\n2003\n01:42:23.013 --> 01:42:25.470\nI probably need to redo my update.\n\n2004\n01:42:25.470 --> 01:42:33.420\nAnd then we can say, app-get upgrade vim.\n\n2005\n01:42:33.420 --> 01:42:36.530\nDon't upgrade everything,\njust upgrade vim.\n\n2006\n01:42:36.530 --> 01:42:40.541\nAnd if any of the dependencies go away,\nleave them in place or I could say,\n\n2007\n01:42:40.541 --> 01:42:41.523\ndist-upgrade.\n\n2008\n01:42:41.523 --> 01:42:44.480\nAnd now if any of the dependencies\nare gone it'll remove them.\n\n2009\n01:42:44.480 --> 01:42:46.710\nSo we can get really specific like that,\n\n2010\n01:42:46.710 --> 01:42:51.870\nwe can tell it how we cant to go\nabout that, I'll go the safer way.\n\n2011\n01:42:51.870 --> 01:42:56.059\nAnd it will look, and there's no updates\navailable, it's running the latest one.\n\n2012\n01:42:56.059 --> 01:43:00.790\nSo 0 remove, 0 upgraded,\nit didn't have to do anything.\n\n2013\n01:43:01.950 --> 01:43:06.570\nSo you may see that when you do the big\nupgrade, when you upgrade everything.\n\n2014\n01:43:06.570 --> 01:43:11.050\nSo if I do the full dist-upgrade\nlike that and run it,\n\n2015\n01:43:11.050 --> 01:43:15.140\nI'm gonna find that everything is current\ncuz I'm pulling from my DVD here.\n\n2016\n01:43:15.140 --> 01:43:18.960\nSo everything is current, doesn't need to\nfind anything special and it's just done.\n\n2017\n01:43:21.020 --> 01:43:24.370\nThe other thing is we can\nremove packages with apt-get.\n\n2018\n01:43:24.370 --> 01:43:26.835\nSo to remove packages you just say,\n\n2019\n01:43:26.835 --> 01:43:31.710\napt-get remove and then the name of\nthe package that you want to remove.\n\n2020\n01:43:31.710 --> 01:43:34.871\nSo I can remove them, if I decide\nthat I don't actually want it, and\n\n2021\n01:43:34.871 --> 01:43:36.432\nthen it's gonna remove it here.\n\n2022\n01:43:36.432 --> 01:43:38.808\nIt will tell me that, I'll say, yes.\n\n2023\n01:43:38.808 --> 01:43:41.525\nAnd that removes it, and it's gone.\n\n2024\n01:43:41.525 --> 01:43:43.510\nSo pretty straightforward there.\n\n2025\n01:43:43.510 --> 01:43:47.624\nWhenever you install a package, it\ndownloads the package from the server or\n\n2026\n01:43:47.624 --> 01:43:49.755\nDVD, wherever you're loading from.\n\n2027\n01:43:49.755 --> 01:43:52.643\nAnd once it's got that,\nonce it's got it downloaded,\n\n2028\n01:43:52.643 --> 01:43:56.790\nit then installs it and\ncopies the files wherever it wants to go.\n\n2029\n01:43:56.790 --> 01:43:59.040\nIt saves those package files though.\n\n2030\n01:43:59.040 --> 01:44:01.778\nSo it actually caches those and\nretains a copy.\n\n2031\n01:44:01.778 --> 01:44:05.060\nIf you wanna get rid of those,\nyou can use the purge modifier.\n\n2032\n01:44:06.540 --> 01:44:13.270\nSo you can say at-get--purge remove vim.\n\n2033\n01:44:13.270 --> 01:44:16.170\nAnd now, when it removes vim,\nthe package which I've already removed it,\n\n2034\n01:44:16.170 --> 01:44:19.710\nbut when it removes it, it not only\nremoves the installed files, but\n\n2035\n01:44:19.710 --> 01:44:22.740\nit removes the cached\ncopy of the package also.\n\n2036\n01:44:22.740 --> 01:44:26.700\nSo if you wanna completely get rid of it,\nyou just add that purge modifier to it.\n\n2037\n01:44:26.700 --> 01:44:31.758\nNow, we don't have it so\nthere's nothing to remove and that's it.\n\n2038\n01:44:31.758 --> 01:44:34.358\nAnd notice it's telling\nme about a dependency.\n\n2039\n01:44:34.358 --> 01:44:37.449\nIt's telling me the following package\nwas automatically installed and\n\n2040\n01:44:37.449 --> 01:44:39.100\nis no longer required vim-runtime.\n\n2041\n01:44:39.100 --> 01:44:43.100\nSo I removed vim but\nthe vim-runtime is still there.\n\n2042\n01:44:43.100 --> 01:44:43.750\nSo I'll go ahead and\n\n2043\n01:44:43.750 --> 01:44:48.060\nknock that one out, by just modifying\nthat command line a little bit.\n\n2044\n01:44:48.060 --> 01:44:52.261\nAnd we'll get that one out of there and\nthere it goes.\n\n2045\n01:44:52.261 --> 01:44:56.849\nNow I've fully removed it, it's out of the\nsystem, and the cache package is gone too,\n\n2046\n01:44:56.849 --> 01:44:57.471\nall right.\n\n2047\n01:44:57.471 --> 01:45:00.246\nSo apt-get, pretty straight forward.\n\n2048\n01:45:00.246 --> 01:45:04.056\nThe main two commands we\nwant are apt-get update,\n\n2049\n01:45:04.056 --> 01:45:08.753\nfollowed by app-get upgrade or\napp-getdisc-upgrade those\n\n2050\n01:45:08.753 --> 01:45:13.550\nare the main ones that we have for\ndoing our updates, all right.\n\n2051\n01:45:13.550 --> 01:45:16.960\nNow, app get, that's the main one,\nthat's the one that we're gonna use,\n\n2052\n01:45:16.960 --> 01:45:20.133\nthat's the one that we're going to\nsee the most commonly, all right.\n\n2053\n01:45:20.133 --> 01:45:24.365\nBut I also mention there's\nthe older utility, dpkg,\n\n2054\n01:45:24.365 --> 01:45:28.180\nthe unpackage manager\nthat is still present.\n\n2055\n01:45:28.180 --> 01:45:30.200\nAnd you can still use it,\nit's there for backwards compatibility.\n\n2056\n01:45:30.200 --> 01:45:33.430\nThey do still update it though, so you\ncould actually choose to use this instead\n\n2057\n01:45:33.430 --> 01:45:36.880\nof the other one if you wanted and\nyou'd be perfectly fine, all right?\n\n2058\n01:45:36.880 --> 01:45:40.613\nSo the way it works is very, very similar,\nthe syntax is not much different.\n\n2059\n01:45:40.613 --> 01:45:44.805\nIf you run, for example, dpkg -l,\nthat's how you get a list of whatever\n\n2060\n01:45:44.805 --> 01:45:47.509\npackages you have installed\non your system, so\n\n2061\n01:45:47.509 --> 01:45:50.435\nit just outputs this\ngigantic list of everything.\n\n2062\n01:45:50.435 --> 01:45:55.574\nAnd I can see, I missed a few,\nI still have vim-common, vim-tiny,\n\n2063\n01:45:55.574 --> 01:46:00.123\nso I've got a few installed that\nIt didn't show me a minute ago,\n\n2064\n01:46:00.123 --> 01:46:04.130\nthat's interesting, so\nI can spot that with dpkg -l.\n\n2065\n01:46:04.130 --> 01:46:08.240\nIf I do dpkg -l in a specific package,\n\n2066\n01:46:08.240 --> 01:46:12.990\nlike whois, it'll give me information\non that one particular package.\n\n2067\n01:46:12.990 --> 01:46:15.900\nWhat it's called,\nwhat version it is and so on.\n\n2068\n01:46:15.900 --> 01:46:18.202\nSo, you can start to extract information.\n\n2069\n01:46:18.202 --> 01:46:20.947\nAnother neat little command we have,\n\n2070\n01:46:20.947 --> 01:46:24.560\nis if you're looking at\na file on your hard drive.\n\n2071\n01:46:24.560 --> 01:46:28.447\nSo you've been kinda messing\naround on your hard drive and\n\n2072\n01:46:28.447 --> 01:46:31.619\nthere is some file and\nyou just don't know where\n\n2073\n01:46:31.619 --> 01:46:35.768\nthat file came from like this\nvimrc file that I got right here.\n\n2074\n01:46:35.768 --> 01:46:39.808\nAnd I wanna know who it is created\nthat this file but what is tied to.\n\n2075\n01:46:39.808 --> 01:46:44.993\nWell, you can use dpkj-s and\nspecify a file and\n\n2076\n01:46:44.993 --> 01:46:49.409\nso I will specify that file right there.\n\n2077\n01:46:49.409 --> 01:46:53.840\nAnd it will take a look at it and\ntell you which package created it.\n\n2078\n01:46:53.840 --> 01:46:58.060\nSo I can see vim-common is what\nactually created this file right here.\n\n2079\n01:46:58.060 --> 01:47:00.820\nThat's very useful if you're trying\nto figure out whether it's safe to\n\n2080\n01:47:00.820 --> 01:47:01.980\ndelete a file.\n\n2081\n01:47:01.980 --> 01:47:07.290\nIf you run dpkg-s it'll scan that file,\nshow you who created it, and\n\n2082\n01:47:07.290 --> 01:47:10.440\nif that package has been removed\nlike vim common is gone now.\n\n2083\n01:47:10.440 --> 01:47:12.560\nThen I can go ahead and\nremove this file, it's safe.\n\n2084\n01:47:12.560 --> 01:47:15.230\nBut if I see a package listed\nthat I still need that tells me,\n\n2085\n01:47:15.230 --> 01:47:16.260\nthat file's off limits.\n\n2086\n01:47:16.260 --> 01:47:18.270\nIf I remove it,\nI might break that package,\n\n2087\n01:47:18.270 --> 01:47:20.430\nso I need to leave it be, all right?\n\n2088\n01:47:20.430 --> 01:47:24.529\nSo, quick easy way to test their dpkg-s.\n\n2089\n01:47:24.529 --> 01:47:26.386\nLet's see do I have anything else?\n\n2090\n01:47:26.386 --> 01:47:28.992\nI think that's about it,\nI'm just gonna skim over my notes here,\n\n2091\n01:47:28.992 --> 01:47:30.728\nit is saying I'm gonna\npost at the episode.\n\n2092\n01:47:30.728 --> 01:47:33.861\nYeah, as far as apt-get and\nthe other ones,\n\n2093\n01:47:33.861 --> 01:47:38.821\nthere are more options with apt-get,\nif you just kinda run it and see.\n\n2094\n01:47:38.821 --> 01:47:42.455\nActually here,\nlet me do it a little bit different here.\n\n2095\n01:47:43.898 --> 01:47:48.790\nThere, so you'll see,\nwe've got install, remove, autoremove.\n\n2096\n01:47:48.790 --> 01:47:52.678\nAutoremove is kinda nice cuz it scans your\nsystem and it removes any unused packages,\n\n2097\n01:47:52.678 --> 01:47:55.332\nany packages that aren't there\nbecause of a dependency.\n\n2098\n01:47:55.332 --> 01:47:57.434\nPurge I showed.\n\n2099\n01:47:57.434 --> 01:48:00.320\nYou'll see clean and auto clean.\n\n2100\n01:48:00.320 --> 01:48:04.860\nSo there's a few modifications,\ndifferent variations that you can use.\n\n2101\n01:48:04.860 --> 01:48:08.179\nYou can also manually install\na package that's not from the library.\n\n2102\n01:48:08.179 --> 01:48:13.264\nSo you go and you get a package from\nsome website they give you a .deb file.\n\n2103\n01:48:13.264 --> 01:48:15.644\nAnd you can download and\ninstall that directly if you want.\n\n2104\n01:48:15.644 --> 01:48:20.350\nSo a lot of different functionality in\nthere but those are the main ones, right.\n\n2105\n01:48:20.350 --> 01:48:26.250\nThe ability to just do application\nupdates and keep your system up to date.\n\n2106\n01:48:26.250 --> 01:48:29.528\nIf you install the graphical user\ninterface, you get little pop-up windows\n\n2107\n01:48:29.528 --> 01:48:31.911\nand a nice little graphical\nwizard that shows all this.\n\n2108\n01:48:31.911 --> 01:48:35.533\nBut in the background, it's just running\napp-get, it's doing the same thing.\n\n2109\n01:48:35.533 --> 01:48:36.752\nIt's looking at the same database.\n\n2110\n01:48:36.752 --> 01:48:38.773\nIt's just here,\nwe do it on the command line.\n\n2111\n01:48:38.773 --> 01:48:42.906\nOn a server with no graphical user\ninterface, this is the way that we do it.\n\n2112\n01:48:42.906 --> 01:48:47.706\nAll right, also keep in mind\nthat updates aren't always\n\n2113\n01:48:47.706 --> 01:48:50.406\nwhat they're cracked up to be.\n\n2114\n01:48:50.406 --> 01:48:52.438\nSo I'm running Debian 7.5.\n\n2115\n01:48:52.438 --> 01:48:57.270\nIf Debian 8 comes out tomorrow, I don't\nneed to jump and update to 8, all right?\n\n2116\n01:48:57.270 --> 01:49:01.056\nI'm still getting security updates for\n7.5s, my system is secure and safe.\n\n2117\n01:49:01.056 --> 01:49:03.949\nIt's just that there's something\nmajor that's been updated.\n\n2118\n01:49:03.949 --> 01:49:07.537\nIf a new PHP library came out,\na new version of MySQL.\n\n2119\n01:49:07.537 --> 01:49:12.614\nAnd I wanna run that new version,\nthen I wanna upgrade my version of Debian.\n\n2120\n01:49:12.614 --> 01:49:15.540\nBut if I'm perfectly happy with\nthe version of MySQL that I have and\n\n2121\n01:49:15.540 --> 01:49:17.150\nI just want security updates.\n\n2122\n01:49:17.150 --> 01:49:20.060\nThere's not really a driving reason\nto upgrade to the newer versions.\n\n2123\n01:49:20.060 --> 01:49:21.640\nAnd in fact, from version to version,\n\n2124\n01:49:21.640 --> 01:49:24.750\nsometimes they'll change things like\ndefaults and that can break your software.\n\n2125\n01:49:24.750 --> 01:49:29.450\nSo, you always wanna carefully\ncalculate whether or not it's time for\n\n2126\n01:49:29.450 --> 01:49:31.480\nyou to update to that new version.\n\n2127\n01:49:31.480 --> 01:49:35.520\nThese updates here with app get,\nthese are safe, these are not a big deal.\n\n2128\n01:49:35.520 --> 01:49:41.281\nBut a big update, an operating\nsystem update going from 7.5 to 8,\n\n2129\n01:49:41.281 --> 01:49:45.200\nthat is a big deal and\nyou may not need to do that.\n\n2130\n01:49:45.200 --> 01:49:47.640\nAll right, now that we're up to date,\nthat's it, right?\n\n2131\n01:49:47.640 --> 01:49:48.720\nWe're ready to rock.\n\n2132\n01:49:48.720 --> 01:49:51.610\nSo that's probably a pretty good point for\nus to stop.\n\n2133\n01:49:51.610 --> 01:49:54.590\nI kinda want to jump into other things,\nbut what we're gonna do is in the next\n\n2134\n01:49:54.590 --> 01:49:57.960\nepisode, we're gonna repeat this\nprocess but was sent OS instead.\n\n2135\n01:49:57.960 --> 01:50:01.476\nWe're gonna take a look at another\ndistribution that's out there and\n\n2136\n01:50:01.476 --> 01:50:03.919\nwe'll see this same process\nkind of repeated but\n\n2137\n01:50:03.919 --> 01:50:07.213\ntaking care of in a different\nmanner using different utilities.\n\n2138\n01:50:07.213 --> 01:50:08.300\nSo, all right,\n\n2139\n01:50:08.300 --> 01:50:13.134\nwell, let me just remind you guys if\nyou have any questions on this stuff.\n\n2140\n01:50:13.134 --> 01:50:16.049\nLive during this show,\nyou can go to itpro.tv/live and\n\n2141\n01:50:16.049 --> 01:50:19.020\nyou'll see our chat room\nright beneath the video.\n\n2142\n01:50:19.020 --> 01:50:20.190\nYou can post your questions there.\n\n2143\n01:50:20.190 --> 01:50:22.520\nWe monitor and answer during the

--> 00:00:47.930\n>> Yeah?\n\n9\n00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:50.610\n>> Yeah, so\nI'm as excited as you are, Don.\n\n10\n00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:51.560\nThat's how excited I am.\n\n11\n00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:52.983\n>> So you preordered it, and you're\nwaiting in line on the Amazon store?\n\n12\n00:00:52.983 --> 00:00:54.364\n>> I will never.\n\n13\n00:00:54.364 --> 00:01:01.740\n>> [LAUGH] Strange devices\nthese companies produce.\n\n14\n00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:04.980\nI'm trying to think of a good segue, here.\n\n15\n00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:06.030\nI'm having a hard time, Ronnie.\n\n16\n00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.770\nCuz I'm thinking Amazon Phone,\nit's Android, Android is Linux, whatever.\n\n17\n00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:11.850\n>> But we are doing Windows Plus.\n\n18\n00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:12.680\n>> All right, we are.\n\n19\n00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.640\nAnd in fact, today we're going to\nbe talking about installing Linux,\n\n20\n00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.480\nwhich is actually kind of a follow\nup to yesterday's episode.\n\n21\n00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:20.960\nIn episode number one,\n\n22\n00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.700\nwe talked about Linux in general\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n23\n00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.350\n>> And we talked about installing\nthe Debian, Linux distribution.\n\n24\n00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.850\nAnd today what we're gonna do is\ncontinue on that same train of thought.\n\n25\n00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.690\nExcept we are gonna switch from\nDebian into a different distribution,\n\n26\n00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:35.880\nthe distribution we are going\nto look at today is CentOS.\n\n27\n00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.150\nAll right, now,\nbefore we dive into CentOS,\n\n28\n00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.640\njust like with Debian, I like to do\njust a little bit of history, so\n\n29\n00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.380\nwe can kind of understand\nwhat we're dealing with.\n\n30\n00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.130\nWhat we're really dealing with,\nnot a truly CentOS, but\n\n31\n00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.480\na distribution from\na company called Red Hat.\n\n32\n00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:54.010\nNow notice what I said there,\na company called Red Hat.\n\n33\n00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:59.450\nRed Hat is the second largest distribution\nof Linux after Debian, right.\n\n34\n00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:04.122\nLet me go back to that family tree\ndiagram I showed the other day.\n\n35\n00:02:04.122 --> 00:02:05.640\nHere we go, this one.\n\n36\n00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.160\nAnd so we took a look at this, and we got\nto see in the family tree how Debian has\n\n37\n00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.630\nled to more Linux offspring\nthan anybody else.\n\n38\n00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:20.160\nAnd even big names like Ubuntu and Knoppix\nare branched off of or forked from Debian,\n\n39\n00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:25.202\nso a really big player in the market and\nextremely open, completely free.\n\n40\n00:02:25.202 --> 00:02:29.010\nAll right, but you don't really\nget any support from them.\n\n41\n00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.980\nYou're really on your\nown when you run that.\n\n42\n00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.639\nSo for businesses, for corporations,\nfor companies that depend on Linux,\n\n43\n00:02:35.639 --> 00:02:40.098\nthey need somebody who they can call\non the phone when they have a problem.\n\n44\n00:02:40.098 --> 00:02:44.610\nAnd not just a local contractor, they need\nsomebody with a lot of technical clout to\n\n45\n00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.855\nbe able to support that in\nmission critical environments.\n\n46\n00:02:47.855 --> 00:02:50.048\nAnd you're just not gonna\nget that from Debian,\n\n47\n00:02:50.048 --> 00:02:52.975\nat least not from their\nofferings as they are now.\n\n48\n00:02:52.975 --> 00:02:55.928\nSo back in, I think it was back in 1993,\n\n49\n00:02:55.928 --> 00:03:00.685\nit was a long time ago,\nlet's go way back, 1994.\n\n50\n00:03:00.685 --> 00:03:06.117\nSo back in 1994, a company called Red Hat\nwas formed to offer a commercially\n\n51\n00:03:06.117 --> 00:03:11.327\nsupported version of Linux, a version\nof Linux that you had, a phone number\n\n52\n00:03:11.327 --> 00:03:14.320\nyou could call, or a support system\nthat you could open tickets on.\n\n53\n00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:18.990\nAnd these would be technicians that\nwere fully trained, ready to help you,\n\n54\n00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:21.140\nready to ensure the product\nworked great for you.\n\n55\n00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.770\nThat was also a company that was\nwilling to do testing and evaluation of\n\n56\n00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:30.610\npatches and updates to ensure that\nthey didn't break anything, right?\n\n57\n00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:34.310\nBecause under Debian, they had that\ndemocracy, that voting system.\n\n58\n00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.900\nAnd it is possible a bad\nupdate can make it through,\n\n59\n00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:38.290\njust because it got enough votes.\n\n60\n00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.380\nBut under Red Hat, it's gotta pass\ntheir security inspections and so on.\n\n61\n00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:45.040\nNow, all of this comes at a price.\n\n62\n00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.158\nIt's not free, right.\n\n63\n00:03:46.158 --> 00:03:47.380\nRed Hat, they used to, but\n\n64\n00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:51.060\nthey do not currently have\na free distribution available.\n\n65\n00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.790\nThey have one little thing I'll\ntalk about a little bit later.\n\n66\n00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.380\nBut as far as their stable operating\nsystem, they don't have a free one.\n\n67\n00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:59.690\nAnd so, if you want it,\nyou've gotta go and buy it.\n\n68\n00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:02.390\nAnd when you buy it,\nyou're buying the operating system,\n\n69\n00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:04.090\nas well as a support agreement.\n\n70\n00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:05.990\nThat's what you're really paying for.\n\n71\n00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:11.080\nSo, you might ask yourself, wait a minute,\nif the Linux kernel is free and\n\n72\n00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:14.430\nthe GNU utilities they use are free and\nif all this stuff is free,\n\n73\n00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.270\nwhy would I pay these guys just for\nsupport?\n\n74\n00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:17.510\nIt doesn't make sense.\n\n75\n00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:19.835\nAnd well, there's actually two things.\n\n76\n00:04:19.835 --> 00:04:21.020\nSo first off is the support.\n\n77\n00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:23.340\nBelieve me, there is value there.\n\n78\n00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.960\nAs a home user, if your computer breaks,\nit's not the end of the world.\n\n79\n00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.490\nBut if you are a multinational\ncorporation,\n\n80\n00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.910\nif you have servers that\nare solely responsible for\n\n81\n00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:35.250\ngenerating the revenue of your company,\nyou need them to be up.\n\n82\n00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.240\nAnd that support is worth\nits weight in gold.\n\n83\n00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.900\nSo, even if was just the support,\nyes, it's worth it.\n\n84\n00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:40.640\nAll right.\n\n85\n00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:45.260\nBut the second thing is they've created\na lot of binaries that are closed source,\n\n86\n00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:49.010\nproprietary software that works\njust within their operating system.\n\n87\n00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:51.860\nAnd it ranges from redundancy and\n\n88\n00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:55.320\nclustering software to\nadvanced storage software.\n\n89\n00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:57.600\nThey've got some neat storage\nstuff they've created.\n\n90\n00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:02.710\nA lot of user administration and\ndirectory services, a lot of things like\n\n91\n00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:07.900\nthat that are not a part of Linux that run\non top of it, that are proprietary, closed\n\n92\n00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:11.360\nsource binaries that they've created\nthat come with the operating system.\n\n93\n00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:16.740\nWhen you buy their copy of Red Hat Linux,\nyou're getting that additional software.\n\n94\n00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:19.700\nIf you go and get a free one,\nyou don't get that software.\n\n95\n00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:23.310\nSo that's the other thing, is the value\nads of the software that they've written.\n\n96\n00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:26.060\nNow, I'm sure there's at least a few\nviewers out there who are just starting to\n\n97\n00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:30.390\nget red and going I hate Red Hat,\nthey ruin everything that is Linux.\n\n98\n00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:34.400\nAnd if you feel that way, then\nabsolutely jump to another distribution.\n\n99\n00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:37.700\nBut I'll speak just for myself.\n\n100\n00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:41.830\nI know I've worked in environments\nwhere I relied on Linux servers,\n\n101\n00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:43.850\nand I needed that safety net.\n\n102\n00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:46.090\nI needed to know that if I\ncouldn't figure out the problem,\n\n103\n00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:47.770\nthere was somebody else I could turn to.\n\n104\n00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:49.440\nAnd that's the real advantage of Red Hat,\nall right.\n\n105\n00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:53.930\nNow, with Red Hat,\nI kind of mentioned this in the last show.\n\n106\n00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:56.160\nThey do have multiple\nversions of their system.\n\n107\n00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:59.695\nTheir main operating system distribution\nis called Red Hat Enterprise Linux.\n\n108\n00:05:59.695 --> 00:06:05.328\nAnd you'll often see it's abbreviated as\nRHEL, and RHEL comes in a server edition,\n\n109\n00:06:05.328 --> 00:06:09.020\na workstation edition,\nand a desktop edition.\n\n110\n00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:11.190\nIf you're gonna run a server,\nobviously you want the server edition,\n\n111\n00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:13.730\nand that's the most expensive one because\n\n112\n00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:17.890\nthey need to be able to provide support at\na server grade level and it's expensive.\n\n113\n00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:20.720\nThe workstation one is\neffectively a server.\n\n114\n00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:23.720\nBut it's designed to run on lower\nend machines, like your laptop or\n\n115\n00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:25.550\ndesktop for testing and development.\n\n116\n00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:29.140\nAnd then the desktop edition is missing\na lot of the server features, a lot of\n\n117\n00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:33.820\nthe server software they add, and it's\ndesigned just to be used as a desktop OS.\n\n118\n00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:38.190\nSo if I go to their website, so I'm\njust gonna fire it up here, redhat.com,\n\n119\n00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:39.980\nwhen I go to their website,\nit's not like Debian.\n\n120\n00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:42.690\nI don't see a great big Get Debian\nlink at the top, and I go and\n\n121\n00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:44.870\ndownload it for\nfree from mirrors and stuff.\n\n122\n00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:48.240\nIf you come in here,\nthere's a Buy Online link, right?\n\n123\n00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:49.630\nAnd so a little bit different.\n\n124\n00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:53.510\nThey do have a free trial that you can\ndo a 30 day demo you can download and\n\n125\n00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:54.450\nrun through.\n\n126\n00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:57.600\nBut if you go to Buy Online,\nyou'll see the pricing is not outrageous.\n\n127\n00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:59.380\nIt is for a home user, I guess.\n\n128\n00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:03.620\nBut if you look at it,\na premium server subscription,\n\n129\n00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:07.930\nright, which will get you just\nthe higher level of support, and\n\n130\n00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:11.915\nthis is what you normally want,\nis $1,299 per year.\n\n131\n00:07:11.915 --> 00:07:14.870\nOkay, so that's one year premium\nsubscription to the server OS,\n\n132\n00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:16.985\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux Server.\n\n133\n00:07:16.985 --> 00:07:21.735\nNow, if you compare that to like\nMicrosoft Windows Server 2012,\n\n134\n00:07:21.735 --> 00:07:27.020\nor 2008 Enterprise Edition, or whatever,\nthat pricing, that's comparable.\n\n135\n00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:30.330\nThat's basically right in line with\nwhat you pay for a Windows server, but\n\n136\n00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:35.130\nin exchange, you're getting something\nthat's much more well-designed\n\n137\n00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:39.460\nto be a 24/7, 365 days a year\nserver versus Windows server,\n\n138\n00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:42.740\nwhich is really a hyped up desktop, right?\n\n139\n00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:45.228\nWe teach Windows shows here,\nI've worked with it,\n\n140\n00:07:45.228 --> 00:07:48.628\nthe majority of my own revenue comes\nfrom Windows based technologies.\n\n141\n00:07:48.628 --> 00:07:51.660\nBut their server is really\na trumped up desktop versus this,\n\n142\n00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:53.330\nwhich is significantly better.\n\n143\n00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:56.130\nSo pricing wise,\nit might seem expensive, but\n\n144\n00:07:56.130 --> 00:07:58.658\nit is actually priced right in my opinion.\n\n145\n00:07:58.658 --> 00:08:00.827\n>> Now Don,\nbefore we go in a little bit further,\n\n146\n00:08:00.827 --> 00:08:03.887\nright underneath where it says\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux Server,\n\n147\n00:08:03.887 --> 00:08:07.460\nwhere it says two sockets,\none physical or two virtual nodes.\n\n148\n00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:09.565\nWhat are they really kind of\ntrying to focus in on there?\n\n149\n00:08:09.565 --> 00:08:13.570\n>> Yeah, their licensing is a little\nstrange sometimes, when they talk about\n\n150\n00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:17.090\nsockets, they're talking about how many\nphysical CPUs you have in your server.\n\n151\n00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:21.580\nMost servers today either come with one or\ntwo physical processors in them, and so\n\n152\n00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:24.720\nyou'll see these cover you for two\nsockets, right, two physical processors.\n\n153\n00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:30.100\nNow, your one physical processor\nmight have eight cores in it, right?\n\n154\n00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:34.850\nBut it's one socket, so if you have two\nsockets with quad core processors you\n\n155\n00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:38.620\ncould actually have 16 cores, but it\nwould fall under that two socket license.\n\n156\n00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:41.430\nNow if you've got a high\nend server like HP and\n\n157\n00:08:41.430 --> 00:08:45.370\nsome of the other guys make servers with\nmultiple physical CPUs in them, you might\n\n158\n00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:50.680\nhave 4 or 8 CPUs in there, you might have\n256 CPUs, if you're doing something crazy.\n\n159\n00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:54.690\nThen, in that case, you've got to buy\nmore licences to cover it, all right?\n\n160\n00:08:54.690 --> 00:08:58.111\nSo, you'll see the server there,\nthere is a server entry level one here,\n\n161\n00:08:58.111 --> 00:08:59.430\nit's much less expensive.\n\n162\n00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:02.237\nNotice that it doesn't take\ncare of virtual nodes, so\n\n163\n00:09:02.237 --> 00:09:06.240\nif you're doing virtualization,\nyou'll have to license each of your VMs.\n\n164\n00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:09.850\nBut if you just need a single\nbox to be a web server or\n\n165\n00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:12.750\nwhatever, it brings\nthe price down quite a bit.\n\n166\n00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:15.249\nThe workstation edition\nis in here somewhere.\n\n167\n00:09:15.249 --> 00:09:17.650\nHere, for desktops and workstation.\n\n168\n00:09:17.650 --> 00:09:21.203\nSo the workstation license is again less\nexpensive, great for development work and\n\n169\n00:09:21.203 --> 00:09:22.011\nadministration.\n\n170\n00:09:22.011 --> 00:09:24.904\nAnd then just for\na regular end user desktop,\n\n171\n00:09:24.904 --> 00:09:27.501\nit's 50 bucks a year which is not bad.\n\n172\n00:09:27.501 --> 00:09:31.949\nBut notice, it comes with self,\nsupport subscription which means you get\n\n173\n00:09:31.949 --> 00:09:35.350\nthe forums and\nthe little knowledge base and that's it.\n\n174\n00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:36.630\nIt's kind of like Microsoft support.\n\n175\n00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:38.258\n>> Yeah.\n>> [LAUGH] You can't actually call\n\n176\n00:09:38.258 --> 00:09:38.788\nsomebody.\n\n177\n00:09:38.788 --> 00:09:41.860\nSo, anyhow, that's the pricing.\n\n178\n00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:46.820\nNow I know talking about money on a Linux\nshow seems counterintuitive, right?\n\n179\n00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:48.920\nWell, here's the thing about Red Hat.\n\n180\n00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:53.180\nThe operating system underneath is still\nthe Linux Kernel, and the GNU utilities,\n\n181\n00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:54.620\nand all those other things.\n\n182\n00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:58.007\nMost of which are covered by the GPL or\na license like that,\n\n183\n00:09:58.007 --> 00:10:02.293\nthat makes it where not only is it free,\nit makes it where if you modify it,\n\n184\n00:10:02.293 --> 00:10:04.385\nyou have to distribute it for free.\n\n185\n00:10:04.385 --> 00:10:07.787\nSo, Red Hat does that for\ntheir in-house code.\n\n186\n00:10:07.787 --> 00:10:10.478\nFor their proprietary software,\nthat's closed source,\n\n187\n00:10:10.478 --> 00:10:12.560\nthey don't have to give that out.\n\n188\n00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:15.451\nBut any changes they make to\nthe operating system itself,\n\n189\n00:10:15.451 --> 00:10:18.170\nthey have to make that publicly\navailable and they do.\n\n190\n00:10:18.170 --> 00:10:22.462\nAnd so Red Hat makes an entire source\ncode repository of their whole operating\n\n191\n00:10:22.462 --> 00:10:26.689\nsystem, minus their proprietary code,\ntheir proprietary software, and\n\n192\n00:10:26.689 --> 00:10:29.320\nthey make it available to the public.\n\n193\n00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:32.795\nBut, it's just source code,\nthey don't actually compile it for you, so\n\n194\n00:10:32.795 --> 00:10:34.065\nthey just leave it there.\n\n195\n00:10:34.065 --> 00:10:37.945\nWell there's a lot of other people\nout there that take code and\n\n196\n00:10:37.945 --> 00:10:42.415\njust recompile it, and effectively\ncreate Red Hat Enterprise Linux but\n\n197\n00:10:42.415 --> 00:10:45.130\nin a non-supported form.\n\n198\n00:10:45.130 --> 00:10:48.100\nOne of the biggest examples\nof that is CentOS.\n\n199\n00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:53.240\nCentOS is the number one\nLinux distribution for\n\n200\n00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:55.590\nuse in corporate and\nenterprise environments.\n\n201\n00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:58.320\nThere are more CentOS servers\nout there than, I believe,\n\n202\n00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:00.450\nany other server type,\nright now, in the market.\n\n203\n00:11:00.450 --> 00:11:02.694\nSo CentOS is very, very common.\n\n204\n00:11:02.694 --> 00:11:07.814\nAnd what it stands for\nis Community Enterprise Operating System.\n\n205\n00:11:07.814 --> 00:11:10.275\nCentOS, Community Enterprise\nOperating System.\n\n206\n00:11:10.275 --> 00:11:14.682\nAnd all it is they took\nthe source code that's freely\n\n207\n00:11:14.682 --> 00:11:19.265\nreleased by Red Hat,\nthey strip out the logos.\n\n208\n00:11:19.265 --> 00:11:23.440\nCuz they can't have the little guy in\na red fedora, so they strip that out, and\n\n209\n00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:27.980\nthey change the name,\nthey change it from Red Hat to CentOS.\n\n210\n00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:30.090\nEverything else is the same.\n\n211\n00:11:30.090 --> 00:11:34.410\nThey just remove that copyrighted\nmaterial and then recompile it and\n\n212\n00:11:34.410 --> 00:11:35.830\nmake it available for you.\n\n213\n00:11:35.830 --> 00:11:38.940\nSo if you go and download CentOS,\nyou are effectively running Red Hat.\n\n214\n00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:41.703\nSame commands, same software,\nsame configuration,\n\n215\n00:11:41.703 --> 00:11:44.122\nsoftware that runs on one\nruns on over the other.\n\n216\n00:11:44.122 --> 00:11:47.852\nYou can even share the package\nupdates between them and\n\n217\n00:11:47.852 --> 00:11:51.680\nthey work just fine,\nit's just you get no support.\n\n218\n00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:55.240\nYou can't call Red Hat and ask for\nhelp, they're not gonna help you, okay?\n\n219\n00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:57.565\nNow, you might say to yourself,\nwait a minute,\n\n220\n00:11:57.565 --> 00:11:59.850\nwouldn't Red Hat be angry about this?\n\n221\n00:11:59.850 --> 00:12:01.200\nWell, they really aren't, and\n\n222\n00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:05.400\nif you notice right here on their website,\nCentOS has joined forces with Red Hat.\n\n223\n00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:10.020\nThe employees that support the CentOS\nproject actually work for Red Hat now.\n\n224\n00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:11.448\nThey draw a salary from Red Hat.\n\n225\n00:12:11.448 --> 00:12:14.680\nSo Red Hat is actually supporting\nthis because they know\n\n226\n00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:17.490\nthat if companies can try CentOS for\nfree and they like it,\n\n227\n00:12:17.490 --> 00:12:20.200\nand then they want support,\nwhat are they gonna do?\n\n228\n00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:21.910\n>> Red Hat.\n>> They're gonna upgrade to Red Hat, and\n\n229\n00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:24.170\nso it really kind of improves\ntheir customer base.\n\n230\n00:12:24.170 --> 00:12:26.010\nSo, if you wanna learn Red Hat,\n\n231\n00:12:26.010 --> 00:12:29.640\nand you wanted to learn it for free,\nCentOS is a great way to do it.\n\n232\n00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:32.910\nYou get everything except for\nthose proprietary pieces of software\n\n233\n00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:36.630\nwhich a lot of people don't like to use\nbecause it locks them into Red Hat,\n\n234\n00:12:36.630 --> 00:12:39.580\nversus if you're just in CentOS, you\ncould jump to Debian or somewhere else.\n\n235\n00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:40.600\nIt wouldn't be that big of a deal,\nall right?\n\n236\n00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:44.490\nThere is another distribution\nworth mentioning here, and\n\n237\n00:12:44.490 --> 00:12:46.270\nthat is Fedora, all right?\n\n238\n00:12:46.270 --> 00:12:50.250\nIf I go back to my little chart here,\nso you've got Red Hat, and\n\n239\n00:12:50.250 --> 00:12:51.540\nyou'll see it branches out.\n\n240\n00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:56.090\nAnd CentOS will be in here somewhere,\nright there, there's CentOS.\n\n241\n00:12:56.090 --> 00:12:59.780\nAnd right above it,\nwe have what's called Fedora Core.\n\n242\n00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:03.280\nAnd you can see where it got\nrenamed to just Fedora, all right?\n\n243\n00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:06.680\nYou will hear a lot of people on the\nInternet talk about how Fedora is great,\n\n244\n00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:09.700\nand they run Fedora as their\ndaily operating system.\n\n245\n00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:12.100\nWell, that's not what it's designed for.\n\n246\n00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:16.200\nFedora is the experimental\noperating system that Red Hat uses.\n\n247\n00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:19.750\nWhen a new feature comes out,\nsome new software or whatever,\n\n248\n00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:24.400\nthey bake it into Fedora to see how it\ndoes, they say, let's give it a shot.\n\n249\n00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:28.900\nAnd so it's packed full of software\nthat hasn't been fully vetted for\n\n250\n00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:30.090\ncorporate use yet.\n\n251\n00:13:30.090 --> 00:13:31.900\nNow, that doesn't mean that it's unstable,\n\n252\n00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:34.800\na lot of it's perfectly stable,\nit just hasn't been fully tested.\n\n253\n00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:38.880\nAnd then they make Fedora available for\nfree and people out there run it and\n\n254\n00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:41.790\nthey test their software and\nthey find bugs and they fix bugs.\n\n255\n00:13:41.790 --> 00:13:44.760\nAnd when they fix stuff and\nthey get it all sorted out,\n\n256\n00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:49.800\nthose fixes get pushed upstream\ninto Red Hat Enterprise Linux and\n\n257\n00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:54.415\nbecome a part of the next version of RHEL,\nall right?\n\n258\n00:13:54.415 --> 00:13:59.184\nSo, when you look at the latest version of\nRed Hat Linux, it may be several months\n\n259\n00:13:59.184 --> 00:14:03.980\nbehind, maybe even several years behind,\nfeature wise, from Fedora, okay?\n\n260\n00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:07.660\nIt's in lock step, as far as\nsecurity fixes and hot fixes, right?\n\n261\n00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:11.660\nBut as far as features, Red Hat\nEnterprise Linux may be even a year\n\n262\n00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:16.173\nbehind because they fully tested and\nvetted that software to be stable and\n\n263\n00:14:16.173 --> 00:14:19.472\nready to use in a corporate\nenterprise environment.\n\n264\n00:14:19.472 --> 00:14:23.326\nNow, if you're installing Linux on your\nlaptop and you want the bleeding edge,\n\n265\n00:14:23.326 --> 00:14:28.616\nlatest hardware support and all that,\nyou'll like Fedora, it's the way to go.\n\n266\n00:14:28.616 --> 00:14:32.826\nBut in a business, where you rely\non that machine to be on 24/7,\n\n267\n00:14:32.826 --> 00:14:37.670\n365 days a year, Fedora's not\nthe operating system for you, okay?\n\n268\n00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:42.550\nSo just be aware that home users, small\nbusiness is different than enterprise,\n\n269\n00:14:42.550 --> 00:14:43.880\nright, than large organizations.\n\n270\n00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:50.190\nSo for the exam, when we talk about\nthe Linux+ exam, and the LPI test and\n\n271\n00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:54.590\nall that we typically use CentOS to\nlearn from because we're operating in\n\n272\n00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:59.630\nthe command line anyway and it's the same\nas Red Hat at that level, at least.\n\n273\n00:14:59.630 --> 00:15:01.290\nSo you can study with that just fine.\n\n274\n00:15:01.290 --> 00:15:04.356\nIf you want, you can go and\nget a demo from Red Hat,\n\n275\n00:15:04.356 --> 00:15:08.311\nI think it's just like /demo or\nsomething to get to their demo.\n\n276\n00:15:08.311 --> 00:15:09.403\nLet me see if I can find it here.\n\n277\n00:15:12.085 --> 00:15:15.928\nRed Hat demo, here, evaluation software.\n\n278\n00:15:15.928 --> 00:15:17.913\nSo it's, well that's kinda long.\n\n279\n00:15:17.913 --> 00:15:24.092\nredhat.com/products/enterprise/linux/serv-\ner/download and you've got an evaluation.\n\n280\n00:15:24.092 --> 00:15:26.517\nSo you can do a 30 day\neval copy of server.\n\n281\n00:15:26.517 --> 00:15:29.118\nit is time bombed,\nat the end of 30 days, it stops working.\n\n282\n00:15:29.118 --> 00:15:33.150\nSo, you basically have it to test with and\nif you like it, you buy it, and\n\n283\n00:15:33.150 --> 00:15:34.088\nthen off you go.\n\n284\n00:15:34.088 --> 00:15:37.942\nAll right, so,\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux really,\n\n285\n00:15:37.942 --> 00:15:41.182\nreally common especially in appliances.\n\n286\n00:15:41.182 --> 00:15:45.875\nI know I've worked with,\nwhat have I worked with that had it?\n\n287\n00:15:45.875 --> 00:15:48.716\nSo like some Qualys ScanGuard\nappliances that were running\n\n288\n00:15:48.716 --> 00:15:50.035\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux.\n\n289\n00:15:50.035 --> 00:15:54.855\nI've worked with some Juniper IPS boxes\nthat were running Red Hat Enterprise.\n\n290\n00:15:54.855 --> 00:15:59.135\nSome RSA secure ID token\nauthentication appliances.\n\n291\n00:15:59.135 --> 00:16:01.155\nAnd those were running\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux.\n\n292\n00:16:01.155 --> 00:16:05.475\nSo you see it very common in\nenterprise and corporate deployments.\n\n293\n00:16:05.475 --> 00:16:06.927\nHome users, you don't see it very much\n\n294\n00:16:06.927 --> 00:16:07.575\nbecause-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n295\n00:16:07.575 --> 00:16:08.742\n>> Well, cuz it cost money, right?\n\n296\n00:16:08.742 --> 00:16:10.608\n>> Yeah.\n>> [LAUGH] So, you don't see it so\n\n297\n00:16:10.608 --> 00:16:11.270\nmuch there.\n\n298\n00:16:11.270 --> 00:16:14.190\nAnd the fact that it's behind\na little bit on the features.\n\n299\n00:16:14.190 --> 00:16:17.940\nIf you want the latest version of Java,\nthe latest version of Chrome, or\n\n300\n00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:21.162\nwhatever, it may not be a part\nof Red Hat Enterprise Linux yet.\n\n301\n00:16:21.162 --> 00:16:24.720\n>> So\ncompared to Debian in terms of stability,\n\n302\n00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:27.830\nRed Hat is the more\nstable of the two then?\n\n303\n00:16:27.830 --> 00:16:30.115\n>> Boy that's a slippery\nslope right there.\n\n304\n00:16:30.115 --> 00:16:32.200\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> If I was on the spot,\n\n305\n00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:33.130\nwhich I guess I am.\n\n306\n00:16:33.130 --> 00:16:35.500\nI would say yes, that it is more stable.\n\n307\n00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:36.948\n>> For an enterprise environment,\nthis is what we would use.\n\n308\n00:16:36.948 --> 00:16:37.699\n>> It all comes down to how you configure.\n\n309\n00:16:37.699 --> 00:16:38.481\n>> Right.\n>> You can configure\n\n310\n00:16:38.481 --> 00:16:39.204\nanything to be unstable.\n\n311\n00:16:39.204 --> 00:16:40.575\n>> Right.\n\n312\n00:16:40.575 --> 00:16:43.961\n>> So Debian, if you're doing your\nupdates, if you're staying on\n\n313\n00:16:43.961 --> 00:16:48.284\nthe edge with Debian and following their\n6 month distribution cycle and all that.\n\n314\n00:16:48.284 --> 00:16:50.949\nIt can be unstable if\nyou make it that way.\n\n315\n00:16:50.949 --> 00:16:51.866\nBut they do a lot of testing.\n\n316\n00:16:51.866 --> 00:16:53.669\n>> Yep.\n>> And there's a lot of people using\n\n317\n00:16:53.669 --> 00:16:54.263\nDebian, and\n\n318\n00:16:54.263 --> 00:16:57.782\nso it can be very stable too, versus\nRed Hat which is pretty much a guarantee.\n\n319\n00:16:57.782 --> 00:16:58.886\n>> Mm.\n>> You know when you're\n\n320\n00:16:58.886 --> 00:17:01.870\nusing Red Hat Enterprise Linux\nthat it's going to be stable.\n\n321\n00:17:01.870 --> 00:17:04.741\nWhen you're using Fedora\n>> Yeah, maybe not so much.\n\n322\n00:17:04.741 --> 00:17:05.242\n>> Well, it's a crapshoot, right?\n\n323\n00:17:05.242 --> 00:17:06.860\nYou don't know.\n\n324\n00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:11.240\nAnd then if you take a look at CentOS,\nthe CentOS guys have to wait for\n\n325\n00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:13.690\nthe Red Hat guys to finish and\nrelease the code.\n\n326\n00:17:13.690 --> 00:17:15.824\nAnd then they compile it into CentOS.\n\n327\n00:17:15.824 --> 00:17:17.730\nAnd so it's a little bit behind.\n\n328\n00:17:17.730 --> 00:17:18.921\nSo even some security and\n\n329\n00:17:18.921 --> 00:17:22.782\nhot fixes might come out that might take\na little longer to make it down to CentOS.\n\n330\n00:17:22.782 --> 00:17:24.367\nSo there are risks involved there.\n\n331\n00:17:24.367 --> 00:17:25.117\n>> Mm hm.\n\n332\n00:17:25.117 --> 00:17:26.366\n>> But that doesn't stop.\n\n333\n00:17:26.366 --> 00:17:26.884\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Thousands\n\n334\n00:17:26.884 --> 00:17:29.116\nof companies from using CentOS\nas their production server.\n\n335\n00:17:29.116 --> 00:17:31.992\n>> Right.\n>> Very, very common that you see that.\n\n336\n00:17:31.992 --> 00:17:36.099\nIf you've used Amazon S3, and\nyou start spinning up virtual machines,\n\n337\n00:17:36.099 --> 00:17:40.616\ntheir default Linux image is, well they\ncall it Amazon Linux, but is is CentOS.\n\n338\n00:17:40.616 --> 00:17:42.366\nIt's just CentOS they\nchanged the name on it.\n\n339\n00:17:42.366 --> 00:17:46.325\n[LAUGH] And so, you know I wonder if that\nshows up in the little family tree here.\n\n340\n00:17:46.325 --> 00:17:47.530\nProbably not.\n\n341\n00:17:47.530 --> 00:17:52.790\nWell you got like asterisks at home and\nelastics and so on.\n\n342\n00:17:52.790 --> 00:17:53.366\nYeah, all right.\n\n343\n00:17:53.366 --> 00:17:59.055\nWell anyhow, so that is one of\nthe default instances with Amazon though.\n\n344\n00:17:59.055 --> 00:18:00.063\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> All right, so\n\n345\n00:18:00.063 --> 00:18:03.073\nthat's kind of a little bit of\nthe history on this one Is these guys\n\n346\n00:18:03.073 --> 00:18:05.390\ncame about in a time when\nLinux was still very new.\n\n347\n00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:08.140\nAnd didn't have a lot of\nclout in the enterprise.\n\n348\n00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:09.280\nAnd they said you know what?\n\n349\n00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:11.310\nWe'll stand by that product,\nwe'll vouch for it,\n\n350\n00:18:11.310 --> 00:18:13.120\nwe'll give you people that can support it.\n\n351\n00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:14.590\nAnd love them or\n\n352\n00:18:14.590 --> 00:18:19.830\nhate them Red Hat really is responsible\nfor Linux being successful in businesses.\n\n353\n00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:22.660\nAnd businesses are they key to\nan operating system succeeding because\n\n354\n00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:23.874\nthat's where they get money from.\n\n355\n00:18:23.874 --> 00:18:24.650\nAll right?\n\n356\n00:18:24.650 --> 00:18:26.677\nAll of these people who\ndownload Debian for\n\n357\n00:18:26.677 --> 00:18:29.050\nfree, a lot of them don't\ngive anything back.\n\n358\n00:18:29.050 --> 00:18:32.750\nThey don't give any code fixes back, and\nthey don't give any money back, right?\n\n359\n00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:36.350\nSo they're not necessarily helping\nthe project just by running the OS.\n\n360\n00:18:36.350 --> 00:18:38.440\nBut with Red Hat you're kind\nof forced to give money back.\n\n361\n00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:42.270\nSo they kind of keep that alive and\nkeep updates coming along, so.\n\n362\n00:18:43.322 --> 00:18:47.490\nAll right, so that's a little\nbit about Red Hat, and CentOS.\n\n363\n00:18:47.490 --> 00:18:49.991\nAnd so we're going to be deploying CentOS.\n\n364\n00:18:49.991 --> 00:18:53.574\nAnd if you want it, let's take a look\nat the website, CentOS is free.\n\n365\n00:18:53.574 --> 00:18:56.116\nYou'll can hear some\npeople call it Cent Os.\n\n366\n00:18:56.116 --> 00:18:59.847\nWhatever, I call it Cent O S, and if you\ngo there you've got a nice big get CentOS\n\n367\n00:18:59.847 --> 00:19:02.600\nbutton at the top where\nyou can go to download it.\n\n368\n00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:05.965\nAnd much like we saw with Debian,\nthere's mirrors and\n\n369\n00:19:05.965 --> 00:19:07.949\ntorrent links that you can use.\n\n370\n00:19:07.949 --> 00:19:12.699\nAnd so we see here download\nthe latest version also via torrent.\n\n371\n00:19:12.699 --> 00:19:14.414\nSo they've got a torrent link there, but\n\n372\n00:19:14.414 --> 00:19:16.866\nthe default is just to go\nstraight to their regular system.\n\n373\n00:19:16.866 --> 00:19:23.280\nNotice as I float over that, my link is\ndirectly to the ISO file for DVD one.\n\n374\n00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:25.360\nIt's the DVD that gives me my install.\n\n375\n00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:30.170\nIt's the 64-bit one right there, that\nit's defaulting to, and you can grab it.\n\n376\n00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:34.514\nYou can also go to alternative downloads\nand you'll find other downloads\n\n377\n00:19:34.514 --> 00:19:38.449\nthat you can get for previous\nversion of CentOS, if you need that.\n\n378\n00:19:38.449 --> 00:19:41.116\nSometimes we're not quite\nready to go to the new one.\n\n379\n00:19:41.116 --> 00:19:44.773\nAnd you can find mirrors that are out\nthere to be able to reach out and\n\n380\n00:19:44.773 --> 00:19:45.699\ndownload them.\n\n381\n00:19:45.699 --> 00:19:47.608\nIn fact, will this take me to a mirror?\n\n382\n00:19:47.608 --> 00:19:49.076\nIt will, yep.\n\n383\n00:19:49.076 --> 00:19:49.844\nSo if I want to go and\n\n384\n00:19:49.844 --> 00:19:52.199\nfind a mirror here's a list of\nmirrors that are out there.\n\n385\n00:19:52.199 --> 00:19:55.280\nAnd you'll see some big names in\nhere as you look down the list.\n\n386\n00:19:55.280 --> 00:20:00.116\nLike I know Harvard's in here somewhere,\nand a-\n\n387\n00:20:00.116 --> 00:20:00.950\n>> Southern Virginia.\n\n388\n00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:02.950\n>> A couple other ones.\n\n389\n00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:05.616\nYeah, you'll find several colleges-\n>> Yeah.\n\n390\n00:20:05.616 --> 00:20:07.223\n>> Right here, utah.edu so\n\n391\n00:20:07.223 --> 00:20:11.324\nI don't know what college that is but\nyou'll find a lot of people.\n\n392\n00:20:11.324 --> 00:20:13.960\nWe have the University of South Florida,\nthat's not far from here.\n\n393\n00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:21.574\nAnd that's usually where I download it\nfrom, if you go to like ftp.usf.edu.\n\n394\n00:20:21.574 --> 00:20:28.340\nAnd we go into pub and CentOS, you see\nthey've got Fedora and Ubuntu, also.\n\n395\n00:20:28.340 --> 00:20:30.040\nSo they're just mirroring these.\n\n396\n00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:33.740\nAnd you can go into CentOS and\nyou can find where they have the latest.\n\n397\n00:20:33.740 --> 00:20:37.700\nThey don't usually keep the older\nversions, but 6.5 is the latest.\n\n398\n00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:42.200\nAnd if I go in there, then I can go in and\nfind the ISOs and download them.\n\n399\n00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:46.310\nSo wherever it is that you choose\nto get them, you can get them.\n\n400\n00:20:46.310 --> 00:20:49.160\nThe torrent files are there,\nthe DVD images are there.\n\n401\n00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:53.281\nJust like Debian,\nyou don't necessarily need DVD number 2.\n\n402\n00:20:53.281 --> 00:20:55.711\nDVD number 2 is a lot smaller, so\nyou can go ahead it if you want, but\n\n403\n00:20:55.711 --> 00:20:57.020\nyou don't necessarily need it.\n\n404\n00:20:57.020 --> 00:20:58.780\nDVD 1 is really all we need.\n\n405\n00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:02.116\nAnd then there's the live\nCD right there also.\n\n406\n00:21:02.116 --> 00:21:03.310\nAll right.\n\n407\n00:21:03.310 --> 00:21:05.640\nJust find a mirror that's near you and\nget it.\n\n408\n00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:08.351\nThese guys, University of\nSouth Florida is based out of Tampa,\n\n409\n00:21:08.351 --> 00:21:11.070\nwhich is about 2 hours from here,\nso it's pretty close.\n\n410\n00:21:11.070 --> 00:21:13.011\nWe don't have the greatest peering\nconnection to them, though.\n\n411\n00:21:13.011 --> 00:21:15.226\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> If I could find somebody in Atlanta or\n\n412\n00:21:15.226 --> 00:21:17.907\nMiami, it'd be better for\nus, but whatever.\n\n413\n00:21:17.907 --> 00:21:19.610\nSo that's how you can kinda get it.\n\n414\n00:21:19.610 --> 00:21:21.970\nIt's an ISO, you download it,\nyou burn it to a disk.\n\n415\n00:21:21.970 --> 00:21:25.040\nOr you can install it to\na virtual machine, it's up to you.\n\n416\n00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:28.110\nNow, here's a great example\nof what I said a minute ago.\n\n417\n00:21:28.110 --> 00:21:31.560\nNotice the latest version of\nCentOS is 6.5, all right.\n\n418\n00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:37.090\nBut if I go to Red Hat, and I go to\ndownload evaluation software, right.\n\n419\n00:21:37.090 --> 00:21:39.110\nIf I want to go and download an eval.\n\n420\n00:21:39.110 --> 00:21:40.020\nWell, it's gonna ask me to log in.\n\n421\n00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:41.795\nLet me just go back here to the.\n\n422\n00:21:41.795 --> 00:21:42.990\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n423\n00:21:42.990 --> 00:21:45.660\n>> To the main page, well,\nwhere is the main page?\n\n424\n00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:48.814\nYou'll notice that the current\nversion of Red Hat is actually\n\n425\n00:21:48.814 --> 00:21:51.680\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux Version 7.\n\n426\n00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:55.160\nNow the version 7 announcement\nliterally happened yesterday.\n\n427\n00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:56.690\n>> Yeah.\n>> Well, If you're watching this live,\n\n428\n00:21:56.690 --> 00:21:57.690\nit happened yesterday.\n\n429\n00:21:57.690 --> 00:22:01.866\nSo it just came out,\nit's gonna take a little while for CentOS.\n\n430\n00:22:01.866 --> 00:22:03.326\nNow sometimes, they are super fast.\n\n431\n00:22:03.326 --> 00:22:04.310\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Sometimes,\n\n432\n00:22:04.310 --> 00:22:07.300\nit's a month later and\nCentOS 7 is out, all right.\n\n433\n00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:12.995\nOther times, like I remember when\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 6 came out.\n\n434\n00:22:12.995 --> 00:22:17.449\nAnd CentOS guys, it was almost a year\nbefore they released that one.\n\n435\n00:22:17.449 --> 00:22:19.590\nIt was a long time,\npeople were starting to get upset.\n\n436\n00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:22.490\nAnd you can't really get upset\nat somebody you're not paying.\n\n437\n00:22:22.490 --> 00:22:24.741\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And so it may take awhile for\n\n438\n00:22:24.741 --> 00:22:26.350\nthat next version to come out.\n\n439\n00:22:26.350 --> 00:22:29.520\nNow for an Enterprise user,\nthat's not a big deal.\n\n440\n00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:32.090\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux\n7 came out yesterday.\n\n441\n00:22:32.090 --> 00:22:35.366\nWe don't necessarily jump on\nthat upgrade today, right?\n\n442\n00:22:35.366 --> 00:22:38.750\nWe wait, we make sure our software\nis compatible, we do our testing.\n\n443\n00:22:38.750 --> 00:22:42.260\nAnd so, if CentOS takes a little while,\nthat's normally fine, right.\n\n444\n00:22:42.260 --> 00:22:46.699\nBut there will be some\ndifference in deployment there.\n\n445\n00:22:46.699 --> 00:22:50.130\nLet me just see if I can find somewhere\nwhere it says that version 7 is out.\n\n446\n00:22:50.130 --> 00:22:54.475\nYou'd think, let's see do they\nhave news or something on here?\n\n447\n00:22:54.475 --> 00:22:57.070\n[LAUGH] So, well, yeah, right here.\n\n448\n00:22:57.070 --> 00:23:01.183\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux Seven,\nwell shoot no it's stupid.\n\n449\n00:23:01.183 --> 00:23:02.128\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Come on,\n\n450\n00:23:02.128 --> 00:23:05.910\nsee this is why I shouldn't be\nallowed to use the Internet.\n\n451\n00:23:05.910 --> 00:23:10.260\nWell anyhow, somewhere in here\nit said it version 7 was out.\n\n452\n00:23:10.260 --> 00:23:14.898\nSo that's a big deal, you know, when\na new version of the OS comes out we've\n\n453\n00:23:14.898 --> 00:23:17.449\ngotta be able to be ready to support that.\n\n454\n00:23:17.449 --> 00:23:20.360\nRight here,\nRed Hat announces updated training.\n\n455\n00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:22.210\nWell, that's updated training.\n\n456\n00:23:22.210 --> 00:23:23.730\nWhere's where they announce the actual?\n\n457\n00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:30.700\nWow, this is just lame.\n\n458\n00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:33.866\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> What are we, in June?\n\n459\n00:23:33.866 --> 00:23:34.782\n>> We are.\n\n460\n00:23:34.782 --> 00:23:38.616\n>> I'm just trying' to see,\nRed Hat announces updated training.\n\n461\n00:23:38.616 --> 00:23:41.617\nRed Hat unveils Red Hat Enterprise Linux\n7, there we go.\n\n462\n00:23:41.617 --> 00:23:43.280\nWhat's the date on this thing?\n\n463\n00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:46.338\nIt should be yesterday, on June 10th,\nI guess I'm off a little bit again.\n\n464\n00:23:46.338 --> 00:23:47.578\nSo that's a week ago.\n\n465\n00:23:47.578 --> 00:23:49.318\nSo a week ago, version 7 came out.\n\n466\n00:23:49.318 --> 00:23:54.578\nSo it'll be a little while before we\nsee CentOS come out, this version.\n\n467\n00:23:54.578 --> 00:23:57.498\nThey do beta periods and stuff also.\n\n468\n00:23:57.498 --> 00:23:59.818\nAll right, so anyhow,\nwe go ahead and download the DVD.\n\n469\n00:23:59.818 --> 00:24:01.820\nAnd we've got 32 bit and 64 bit.\n\n470\n00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:06.730\nThere are other platforms they compile on,\nbut it's not like Debian,\n\n471\n00:24:06.730 --> 00:24:07.900\nthey don't support as many.\n\n472\n00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:10.932\nThey support the ones that\nare financially viable, right?\n\n473\n00:24:10.932 --> 00:24:15.290\nUnlike Debian, that'll support anyone\nthat a programmer's willing to write for,\n\n474\n00:24:15.290 --> 00:24:17.810\nthese guys support the ones\nthat are financially viable.\n\n475\n00:24:17.810 --> 00:24:24.320\nAnd so looking at this mirror I,\njust have the 64 bit, and the 32 bit one.\n\n476\n00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:29.308\nIf we take, you know what,\nthat's all we have now isn't it?\n\n477\n00:24:29.308 --> 00:24:33.848\nSo, you'll see where they've pruned off\ns390, they've pruned off ia64, yeah.\n\n478\n00:24:33.848 --> 00:24:37.308\nSo as of version 5,\nwe just have the 32 bit and 64 bit.\n\n479\n00:24:37.308 --> 00:24:39.850\nSo, again, just what's financially viable.\n\n480\n00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:44.590\nSo going back to my comment from\nyesterday's show of you gotta\n\n481\n00:24:44.590 --> 00:24:47.380\nfind a distribution that meets\nthe same goals as yours, and\n\n482\n00:24:47.380 --> 00:24:50.850\nyou know will be around awhile, we know\nCentOS is gonna be around for a while.\n\n483\n00:24:50.850 --> 00:24:52.659\nWe know Red Hat is gonna\nbe around a while,\n\n484\n00:24:52.659 --> 00:24:54.432\ncuz they're both the same company now.\n\n485\n00:24:54.432 --> 00:24:56.800\nAnd they both actually\ngenerate positive earnings.\n\n486\n00:24:56.800 --> 00:24:58.340\nSo they make money, right?\n\n487\n00:24:58.340 --> 00:25:03.910\nBut then, as far as goals, the goal of\nRed Hat is to provide you with a stable,\n\n488\n00:25:03.910 --> 00:25:08.750\nconsistent operating system\nthat's backed with support, okay?\n\n489\n00:25:08.750 --> 00:25:12.720\nIf that's your goal, CentOS is for\nyou or Red Hat is for you,\n\n490\n00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:14.220\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux.\n\n491\n00:25:14.220 --> 00:25:18.190\nBut if you want a cutting edge\ndistribution that's undergone a decent\n\n492\n00:25:18.190 --> 00:25:20.910\namount of testing,\nthat's willing to add new features and\n\n493\n00:25:20.910 --> 00:25:24.340\nsupport all sorts of things, as long as\nthere's a program out there to support it,\n\n494\n00:25:24.340 --> 00:25:26.990\nthen Debian is the operating system for\nyou, right?\n\n495\n00:25:26.990 --> 00:25:28.810\nThat's the distribution for you.\n\n496\n00:25:28.810 --> 00:25:31.370\nSo it's all about picking\nthe right one for you.\n\n497\n00:25:31.370 --> 00:25:35.300\nAnd you'll find people like me,\nwhere I use different ones, right?\n\n498\n00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:41.141\nSo I might use CentOS on every business\nserver that I have to work on, right?\n\n499\n00:25:41.141 --> 00:25:45.290\nOr not CentOS, CentOS or RedHat, depending\non the amount of money your company has.\n\n500\n00:25:45.290 --> 00:25:49.430\nSo if it's a for profit company I almost\nalways use Red Hat Enterprise Linux.\n\n501\n00:25:49.430 --> 00:25:52.100\nIf it's a non-profit company or\nsomebody on a shoestring budget,\n\n502\n00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:55.240\nI might use CentOS in\na business environment, right?\n\n503\n00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:59.724\nBut for my own systems at home,\nI'll use Debian, right?\n\n504\n00:25:59.724 --> 00:26:01.809\nAnd that's because I have\naccess to more things and\n\n505\n00:26:01.809 --> 00:26:05.130\nI'm always trying to learn stuff and see,\nget a little more opportunity there.\n\n506\n00:26:05.130 --> 00:26:09.170\nSo it just kinda depends on where I am,\nwhich one I'm gonna use.\n\n507\n00:26:09.170 --> 00:26:11.330\nBut if you just pick one and\nstick with it, you can't go wrong.\n\n508\n00:26:11.330 --> 00:26:12.690\nIt's not like either them them are bad.\n\n509\n00:26:12.690 --> 00:26:16.559\nAnd then there's a ton other ones\nout there, Linux Mint and so on.\n\n510\n00:26:17.690 --> 00:26:21.988\nAll right, so we download our ISO and then\nwe burn it to a disc to do the install or\n\n511\n00:26:21.988 --> 00:26:25.595\nwe stick it in a virtual machine and\ndo our install there, right?\n\n512\n00:26:25.595 --> 00:26:26.420\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n513\n00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:29.370\n>> And that's what we're gonna do, we're\ngonna walk through to the installation\n\n514\n00:26:29.370 --> 00:26:31.930\nof CentOS, just like we did with Debian.\n\n515\n00:26:31.930 --> 00:26:34.980\nAnd get a chance to kind of see that,\nsee how it works, see what's involved.\n\n516\n00:26:34.980 --> 00:26:38.260\nAnd you'll see it's very similar to what\nwe went through in the last episode.\n\n517\n00:26:39.450 --> 00:26:41.990\nAll right, but now is a pretty good\nspot for us to stop and take a break, so\n\n518\n00:26:41.990 --> 00:26:42.790\nwhy don't we do this.\n\n519\n00:26:42.790 --> 00:26:48.474\nWe'll take a TV time out and\nwhen we get back, we'll install CentOS.\n\n520\n00:26:48.474 --> 00:26:54.891\n[MUSIC]\n\n521\n00:26:54.891 --> 00:26:57.030\n[LAUGH] All right,\nwelcome back, everybody.\n\n522\n00:26:57.030 --> 00:27:00.240\nOkay, so what we're gonna do now is\nwe're gonna see installing CentOS.\n\n523\n00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:01.830\n>> Right.\n>> And what I've done is I've basically\n\n524\n00:27:01.830 --> 00:27:04.270\npopped in my disk and\nstarted up the machine.\n\n525\n00:27:04.270 --> 00:27:07.250\nAnd so when you go to do your install,\n\n526\n00:27:07.250 --> 00:27:09.775\nyou're gonna be greeted by\nthis screen right here.\n\n527\n00:27:09.775 --> 00:27:12.370\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And if you watched the Debian episode,\n\n528\n00:27:12.370 --> 00:27:13.790\nyou'll see this is pretty similar, right?\n\n529\n00:27:14.810 --> 00:27:19.680\nI have got install or upgrade an existing\nsystem, it gonna do a regular install.\n\n530\n00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:22.510\nInstall the system with\nthe basic video card driver,\n\n531\n00:27:22.510 --> 00:27:25.390\nif the display is not working for\nus, we can drop to that.\n\n532\n00:27:26.580 --> 00:27:30.710\nRescue the installed system, if I had\na system I couldn't boot off here I could\n\n533\n00:27:30.710 --> 00:27:33.240\nboot of the disk to try and fix it.\n\n534\n00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:37.080\nBoot from the local drive, in other words,\noops, I didn't mean to boot from the DVD,\n\n535\n00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:38.910\nlet me boot from the hard drive.\n\n536\n00:27:38.910 --> 00:27:42.580\nAnd then a memory test, we can scan the\nRAM in our system to ensure that we don't\n\n537\n00:27:42.580 --> 00:27:44.880\nhave any corrupt memory.\n\n538\n00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:47.016\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\njust install or upgrade.\n\n539\n00:27:47.016 --> 00:27:50.724\nSo I'll choose that first option, and\nthat's gonna launch our installer.\n\n540\n00:27:50.724 --> 00:27:55.404\nSo here it's booting up a special\nversion of Linux from the disc,\n\n541\n00:27:55.404 --> 00:27:58.510\nbasically a live CD to do the install.\n\n542\n00:27:58.510 --> 00:28:02.200\nSo it's gonna boot up here and\nthen it will be taken into a kinda\n\n543\n00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:05.090\ngraphical environment to\nactually do our install.\n\n544\n00:28:06.540 --> 00:28:11.460\nJust on a side note, the CentOS installer\nis called the Anaconda installer.\n\n545\n00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:14.920\nEach of the distros has slightly\ndifferent installation methods.\n\n546\n00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:19.260\nSo this one is one they've created over\nthe years to be flexible, and easy to use,\n\n547\n00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:20.600\nand so on.\n\n548\n00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:22.870\nIf you go with the text based installer,\n\n549\n00:28:22.870 --> 00:28:24.870\nit actually looks the same\nas the Debian side.\n\n550\n00:28:24.870 --> 00:28:29.020\nAnd you'll see there's a blue background\nwith the red buttons and stuff.\n\n551\n00:28:29.020 --> 00:28:31.300\nIf you've got a supported video adapter,\n\n552\n00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:33.080\nlike if I were doing this\nnatively on my laptop,\n\n553\n00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:39.250\nI would actually see a full GUI that's\ngot a nice, wizard that you go through.\n\n554\n00:28:39.250 --> 00:28:42.620\nBut my video card here in VMware,\nat least, does not support it, so\n\n555\n00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:43.715\nit drops to this one.\n\n556\n00:28:43.715 --> 00:28:47.660\nAnaconda automatically detects that versus\non the Debian side we get to manually\n\n557\n00:28:47.660 --> 00:28:52.680\nchoose to go the graphical mode or\nthe regular mode, so.\n\n558\n00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:56.135\nOne of the big things that leads to\nmessed up installations of Linux,\n\n559\n00:28:56.135 --> 00:28:56.807\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n560\n00:28:56.807 --> 00:28:58.171\n>> Is when we have bad discs,\n\n561\n00:28:58.171 --> 00:29:02.070\ndiscs that have gotten scratched or\njust bad downloads of the ISOs.\n\n562\n00:29:02.070 --> 00:29:03.530\nSo when you launch the CentOS installer,\n\n563\n00:29:03.530 --> 00:29:07.460\nthe first thing it asks is,\nwould you like to test the media?\n\n564\n00:29:07.460 --> 00:29:09.920\nScan your disc to make sure\nit's not damaged, all right?\n\n565\n00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:12.200\nCuz you don't wanna be halfway\nthrough an install and\n\n566\n00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:14.190\nall of a sudden, the install fails, right?\n\n567\n00:29:14.190 --> 00:29:16.760\nSo, if you say OK,\nit'll scan that disk and look for it.\n\n568\n00:29:16.760 --> 00:29:20.320\nI've got an ISO, and if you\ndownloaded the MD5 checks on them and\n\n569\n00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:23.960\nran it against it and you know the file is\nnot corrupt, you can just skip past that.\n\n570\n00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:25.370\nBut otherwise you wanna do it.\n\n571\n00:29:25.370 --> 00:29:26.490\nIt'll save you some headache.\n\n572\n00:29:28.002 --> 00:29:30.770\nAll right,\nthen we're gonna move into our installer.\n\n573\n00:29:30.770 --> 00:29:33.266\nYou can see I'm using the 64 bit version.\n\n574\n00:29:33.266 --> 00:29:37.370\nUp at the top it says x86_64,\nso this is the 64 bit version.\n\n575\n00:29:37.370 --> 00:29:40.690\nIf it was the 32 bit one,\nit would just say x86 up there, or i386.\n\n576\n00:29:40.690 --> 00:29:44.450\n>> Right, yeah.\n>> So all right, so it found my DVD,\n\n577\n00:29:44.450 --> 00:29:45.800\nwhich is handy.\n\n578\n00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:47.360\nAnd now it's gonna tell me,\n\n579\n00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:50.185\nhey, you've got some hardware\nthat is not supported, right?\n\n580\n00:29:50.185 --> 00:29:52.175\nSo it's just giving me\na little warning there,\n\n581\n00:29:52.175 --> 00:29:56.285\nletting me know that I might\nhave a problem if I don't.\n\n582\n00:29:56.285 --> 00:29:58.817\nWell actually, hang on,\nis it gonna let me get past that,\n\n583\n00:29:58.817 --> 00:30:01.095\nor is it gonna really get angry with me?\n\n584\n00:30:01.095 --> 00:30:04.130\nOftentimes you'll see where if you try and\n\n585\n00:30:04.130 --> 00:30:09.410\ndo the 64 bit installer on a 32 bit\nmachine, it may die out like that.\n\n586\n00:30:09.410 --> 00:30:11.680\nAnd you know what,\nI bet that's exactly what I did.\n\n587\n00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:16.460\nI must have set that up as\na 32 bit machine by accident.\n\n588\n00:30:16.460 --> 00:30:19.670\n[LAUGH] So that's gonna stop that one.\n\n589\n00:30:21.380 --> 00:30:22.490\nAll right, there we go, so\n\n590\n00:30:22.490 --> 00:30:26.670\neven though it said unsupported hardware,\nI'm running VMware, VMware Fusion.\n\n591\n00:30:26.670 --> 00:30:29.900\nAnd so it's picking up some of\nthat virtualization hardware and\n\n592\n00:30:29.900 --> 00:30:32.400\nwhat it's gonna do is it's gonna\ncomplain a little bit about it.\n\n593\n00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:35.385\nBut after the install,\nI can add the drivers that I need and\n\n594\n00:30:35.385 --> 00:30:36.418\nit'll be happy again.\n\n595\n00:30:36.418 --> 00:30:39.640\nBut it tested my video card,\napparently got happy about that and\n\n596\n00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:42.280\nswitched me over to the graphical install.\n\n597\n00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:44.710\nSo I see the graphical\nCentOS installer here.\n\n598\n00:30:44.710 --> 00:30:48.110\nAnd I can just go in and\nclick Next to move forward.\n\n599\n00:30:48.110 --> 00:30:49.830\nI'm gonna pick English.\n\n600\n00:30:49.830 --> 00:30:52.800\nIf my video card hadn't been\nsupported it would've kept me in that\n\n601\n00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:55.870\nblue background with the red buttons and\nthis would all just be text.\n\n602\n00:30:55.870 --> 00:30:57.450\nIt's the same installer though.\n\n603\n00:30:57.450 --> 00:31:00.120\nSo I'll go ahead and hit Next.\n\n604\n00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:03.090\nMy locality for my keyboard,\nI'll stick with English.\n\n605\n00:31:04.660 --> 00:31:06.390\nAnd then, as we move forward,\n\n606\n00:31:06.390 --> 00:31:09.320\nnow it's asking about my storage devices,\nall right?\n\n607\n00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:14.050\nIf you're on a system that just\nhas SATA drives, or SCSI drives,\n\n608\n00:31:14.050 --> 00:31:18.340\nSAS drives, whatever, then you can\nprobably stick with basic storage devices.\n\n609\n00:31:18.340 --> 00:31:21.031\nBut if you're attached to a SAN,\nif you have fiber HBAs,\n\n610\n00:31:21.031 --> 00:31:24.622\nif you have specialized raid controllers\nthat CentOS doesn't recognize,\n\n611\n00:31:24.622 --> 00:31:27.391\nyou're gonna need to choose\nto do a specialized storage.\n\n612\n00:31:27.391 --> 00:31:32.866\nAnd you'll see it gives you support for\nthings like fiber channel over ethernet,\n\n613\n00:31:32.866 --> 00:31:37.960\niSCSI, so SCSI over TCP/IP, zFCP and\nother technologies like that.\n\n614\n00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:40.860\nSo you can choose that to get\nthose configured and use those for\n\n615\n00:31:40.860 --> 00:31:41.910\nyour boot disk.\n\n616\n00:31:41.910 --> 00:31:45.396\nBut for me, it directly attached, I don't\nhave to worry about special drivers, so\n\n617\n00:31:45.396 --> 00:31:46.486\nwe can just move forward.\n\n618\n00:31:48.426 --> 00:31:53.686\nAll right, now it's warning me that\nmy hard drive might contain data.\n\n619\n00:31:53.686 --> 00:31:56.546\nAnd if I do the install I got a choice.\n\n620\n00:31:56.546 --> 00:32:00.111\nI can either wipe it out from my\ninstall or I can keep the data and\n\n621\n00:32:00.111 --> 00:32:03.966\nI'll have to do a creative\npartitioning scheme to allow for that.\n\n622\n00:32:03.966 --> 00:32:07.016\nTypically we just want to wipe it\ncuz we're going to be using this as\n\n623\n00:32:07.016 --> 00:32:07.620\nour base OS.\n\n624\n00:32:07.620 --> 00:32:13.710\nSo I'm going to go ahead and say yes,\ndiscard any data, all right.\n\n625\n00:32:13.710 --> 00:32:15.920\nNow it's asking for a host name.\n\n626\n00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:19.910\nThe host name here, it defaults to\nlocalhost.localdomain, and if you're\n\n627\n00:32:19.910 --> 00:32:25.060\nnot connecting to a company network,\nthen you may not even mess with this, but\n\n628\n00:32:25.060 --> 00:32:31.474\nI'm gonna go ahead and change it, so this\nis gonna be my dp-centos.lab.itpro.tv.\n\n629\n00:32:33.290 --> 00:32:36.130\nIn the Debian show I did\ndp-debian.lab.itpro.tv so\n\n630\n00:32:36.130 --> 00:32:38.190\nthis will be just on the same.\n\n631\n00:32:39.190 --> 00:32:41.270\nI've also got where I can\nconfigure my network.\n\n632\n00:32:41.270 --> 00:32:44.250\nIf you have more than one network adapter,\nyou may need to do this.\n\n633\n00:32:44.250 --> 00:32:46.860\nIf you've got DHCP enabled on the network,\n\n634\n00:32:46.860 --> 00:32:49.530\nyou can probably just stick with\nthe defaults and not even go in there.\n\n635\n00:32:49.530 --> 00:32:52.740\nBut if you don't have DHCP you\nmay need to come in here and\n\n636\n00:32:52.740 --> 00:32:55.200\nmanually set an IP address.\n\n637\n00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:57.660\nAnd you've got all the various values\nin here where you can do that.\n\n638\n00:32:57.660 --> 00:33:01.370\nHere I can set IPv4 and IPv6 if needed.\n\n639\n00:33:01.370 --> 00:33:04.890\nOn our network we've got DHCP, so\nI'm not gonna set any of that.\n\n640\n00:33:04.890 --> 00:33:07.570\nI'm just gonna close out and\nI'll just stick with the defaults.\n\n641\n00:33:07.570 --> 00:33:09.040\n>> Now, Don,\nbefore you move on from there,\n\n642\n00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:11.340\non that network it says something\nabout connecting automatically.\n\n643\n00:33:11.340 --> 00:33:14.469\nDo we need to choose that in our VM or\nnot?\n\n644\n00:33:14.469 --> 00:33:17.176\n>> Yeah, so we're actually going\nto see that a little bit later.\n\n645\n00:33:17.176 --> 00:33:17.844\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> All right.\n\n646\n00:33:17.844 --> 00:33:18.594\nI just wanted to make sure.\n\n647\n00:33:18.594 --> 00:33:20.250\n>> If I don't choose that.\n\n648\n00:33:20.250 --> 00:33:20.940\n>> Yeah.\n\n649\n00:33:20.940 --> 00:33:25.030\n>> And I do like a minimal install,\nwhen I reboot after the install and\n\n650\n00:33:25.030 --> 00:33:28.700\nCentOS comes up, there will be\nno network adapters attached.\n\n651\n00:33:28.700 --> 00:33:31.960\nThe network adapters will be there,\nbut they won't be turned on, right?\n\n652\n00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:35.740\nSo when we go here into configure network,\nand we edit this one,\n\n653\n00:33:35.740 --> 00:33:38.880\nyou'll see that option where it\nsays connect automatically so\n\n654\n00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:41.360\nthat when the system\nboots up it does it okay.\n\n655\n00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:44.190\nNow I'm not going to do that and\nthe reason is,\n\n656\n00:33:44.190 --> 00:33:46.560\nif you do a minimal install you\nwon't even get this option.\n\n657\n00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:49.595\nLike if I were in the text based\ninstaller I wouldn't even see this.\n\n658\n00:33:49.595 --> 00:33:52.670\nSo I want to do it the other way so\nthat we can see what's involved in kind\n\n659\n00:33:52.670 --> 00:33:54.927\nof fixing that because it\nis a pretty common thing.\n\n660\n00:33:54.927 --> 00:33:56.178\n>> Yeah.\n\n661\n00:33:56.178 --> 00:34:01.600\n>> All right so I'll go ahead and cancel\nthat and we'll move forward, all right.\n\n662\n00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:04.720\nNext I can pick my time zone,\nit's suggesting New York for me, and\n\n663\n00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:05.950\nI'm fine with that.\n\n664\n00:34:05.950 --> 00:34:10.630\nIt's also asking if my\ncomputer bios is using UTC or\n\n665\n00:34:10.630 --> 00:34:14.720\nZULU time, the greatest mean time\nto be able to list the timing, or\n\n666\n00:34:14.720 --> 00:34:18.380\nif it's already been adjusted for\nmy local time zone all right.\n\n667\n00:34:18.380 --> 00:34:22.270\nMine is actually using UTC,\nit's what VMWare does, so\n\n668\n00:34:22.270 --> 00:34:23.580\nI can leave that option checked.\n\n669\n00:34:23.580 --> 00:34:26.090\nIf it was already in the right\ntime zone I could uncheck that and\n\n670\n00:34:26.090 --> 00:34:30.760\nI wouldn't have to worry about it,\nbut I'll check it, all right.\n\n671\n00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:32.805\nIt needs a password from my root account.\n\n672\n00:34:32.805 --> 00:34:34.410\nRight that super user account.\n\n673\n00:34:34.410 --> 00:34:36.910\nSo I'll go ahead and punch in a password.\n\n674\n00:34:36.910 --> 00:34:38.570\nAnd we'll punch that in there.\n\n675\n00:34:38.570 --> 00:34:40.380\nI think I typed it the same way twice.\n\n676\n00:34:40.380 --> 00:34:41.530\nThere we go.\n\n677\n00:34:41.530 --> 00:34:44.330\nI used the word password,\nall lower case, which oddly enough,\n\n678\n00:34:44.330 --> 00:34:45.780\nthey flag as a weak password.\n\n679\n00:34:45.780 --> 00:34:46.350\n>> Mm.\n\n680\n00:34:46.350 --> 00:34:48.720\n>> So I'm going to go ahead and\nuse it anyway.\n\n681\n00:34:48.720 --> 00:34:50.260\nObviously you wanna use a strong password.\n\n682\n00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:56.230\nAll right now my disk layout.\n\n683\n00:34:56.230 --> 00:35:00.361\nNow, when we did Debian, we had a lot of\nchoices in there about whether we wanted\n\n684\n00:35:00.361 --> 00:35:02.969\nto use the logical volume manager or\nnot and so on.\n\n685\n00:35:02.969 --> 00:35:05.284\nWhen you look here, the default for\n\n686\n00:35:05.284 --> 00:35:08.844\nthe majority of these includes\nusing the LVM, right?\n\n687\n00:35:08.844 --> 00:35:11.723\nRed Hat was instrumental in\nthe development in of the LVM, and so\n\n688\n00:35:11.723 --> 00:35:13.990\nthey push it as a default\non their installs.\n\n689\n00:35:13.990 --> 00:35:16.540\nIn fact, we have to do a custom\nlayout if we wanna not use it.\n\n690\n00:35:16.540 --> 00:35:18.450\nOtherwise it is going to use it.\n\n691\n00:35:18.450 --> 00:35:21.000\nSo we have options like\nencrypting the system\n\n692\n00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:22.650\nregardless which of these we choose.\n\n693\n00:35:22.650 --> 00:35:24.270\nSo a little bit more flexibility there.\n\n694\n00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:27.940\nWe can choose to use\nthe entire drive if we want.\n\n695\n00:35:27.940 --> 00:35:30.800\nWe can say just replace\nexisting Linux systems,\n\n696\n00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:35.580\nif you find Windows or something,\nleave it be, but don't leave Linux.\n\n697\n00:35:35.580 --> 00:35:39.840\nYou can shrink the current\nsystem to make room for CentOS,\n\n698\n00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:44.770\nif we wanna dual boot or we can just\ninstall on free space that already exists.\n\n699\n00:35:44.770 --> 00:35:49.910\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nuse all the space, all right.\n\n700\n00:35:49.910 --> 00:35:51.860\nAnd you know actually,\nI'm gonna go back real quick.\n\n701\n00:35:51.860 --> 00:35:54.150\nThere's one other option down\nhere that says review and\n\n702\n00:35:54.150 --> 00:35:55.480\nmodify partitioning layout.\n\n703\n00:35:55.480 --> 00:35:57.760\nI'm gonna choose that just so\nyou guys can see it.\n\n704\n00:35:57.760 --> 00:36:00.540\nIf we were to do a custom,\nwe would start from scratch, and\n\n705\n00:36:00.540 --> 00:36:02.540\nwe could build our own partition layout.\n\n706\n00:36:02.540 --> 00:36:03.550\nBut I'm gonna do it this way so\n\n707\n00:36:03.550 --> 00:36:05.870\nthat we can see the partitions\nthat it's going to create.\n\n708\n00:36:05.870 --> 00:36:08.600\nAnd when I hit next,\nyou'll see what it's doing.\n\n709\n00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:10.820\nHere's SDA1 and SDA2.\n\n710\n00:36:10.820 --> 00:36:12.850\nI've got my boot, and\n\n711\n00:36:12.850 --> 00:36:16.730\nthen my other one, just like we saw\nunder Debian right, no difference there.\n\n712\n00:36:16.730 --> 00:36:18.210\nAnd then I've got my LV's,\n\n713\n00:36:18.210 --> 00:36:22.510\nmy logical volumes for root, which is\nthe majority of the drive and swap.\n\n714\n00:36:22.510 --> 00:36:27.130\nSo the default here in sentOS is really\nthe same as it was in Debian if you just\n\n715\n00:36:27.130 --> 00:36:28.240\nlet it go their way.\n\n716\n00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:30.860\nBut if you want to do things\nlike mount your slash\n\n717\n00:36:30.860 --> 00:36:34.120\nhome folder to be in a different\npartition and so on, for\n\n718\n00:36:34.120 --> 00:36:37.800\nthat you're gonna have to do a custom\nlayout and so I could do that now.\n\n719\n00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:39.910\nWe could go in and\ntake some of these and edit them.\n\n720\n00:36:39.910 --> 00:36:43.350\nYou know I could take root and\nshrink it down if I wanted and\n\n721\n00:36:43.350 --> 00:36:48.170\nthen, create a new partition and\nmap home to that, and so on.\n\n722\n00:36:48.170 --> 00:36:50.350\nSo you can adjust this to meet your needs.\n\n723\n00:36:50.350 --> 00:36:56.558\nBut, I'm just going to stick with\nthe defaults here, all right.\n\n724\n00:36:56.558 --> 00:37:00.950\nSo here it's just warning me that I've\ngot some pre-existing devices and\n\n725\n00:37:00.950 --> 00:37:02.390\nit's going to format them.\n\n726\n00:37:02.390 --> 00:37:05.520\nSo it's going to format the SDA,\nthat first hard drive.\n\n727\n00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:08.340\nAnd so I'll go ahead and format that.\n\n728\n00:37:08.340 --> 00:37:10.150\nAnd we'll write the changes to the disk.\n\n729\n00:37:12.890 --> 00:37:13.445\nThere we go.\n\n730\n00:37:13.445 --> 00:37:14.320\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n731\n00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:15.760\n>> All right once it's formatted.\n\n732\n00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:20.030\nAnd remember, if it's a big drive, it\nmight take a little bit longer to format.\n\n733\n00:37:20.030 --> 00:37:22.750\nIt's pretty quick, so I mean,\n\n734\n00:37:22.750 --> 00:37:25.290\nlike a terabyte drive usually\njust takes a couple of minutes.\n\n735\n00:37:25.290 --> 00:37:28.830\nThis one should only take a couple\nof seconds as it lays itself out.\n\n736\n00:37:28.830 --> 00:37:32.120\nOnce it's done, we're ready to\nactually move into the install.\n\n737\n00:37:32.120 --> 00:37:34.567\nAnd so we're going to see\na few more choices here,\n\n738\n00:37:34.567 --> 00:37:36.969\nwe've got it asking about\nthe boot logger okay?\n\n739\n00:37:36.969 --> 00:37:39.302\nDo we wanna go ahead and\ninstall the boot loader now?\n\n740\n00:37:39.302 --> 00:37:44.165\nAnd it wants to install\nit into our boot sector.\n\n741\n00:37:44.165 --> 00:37:45.950\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Of our primary partition.\n\n742\n00:37:45.950 --> 00:37:49.600\nAnd it's mapping one OS right now, CentOS.\n\n743\n00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:52.580\nIf I had other operating systems on here,\nI could hit Add and I could\n\n744\n00:37:52.580 --> 00:37:55.810\nadd in the other ones I had and point to\nwhere on the hard drive they resided.\n\n745\n00:37:55.810 --> 00:37:59.450\nSo dual boot is supported, all right.\n\n746\n00:37:59.450 --> 00:38:01.230\nI can also set a boot loader password, so\n\n747\n00:38:01.230 --> 00:38:03.610\njust to turn the computer on\nyou've got to have a password.\n\n748\n00:38:03.610 --> 00:38:06.680\nSome people like that,\nI don't think it's terribly useful.\n\n749\n00:38:11.012 --> 00:38:13.620\nAll right, and now,\nthe question of the day.\n\n750\n00:38:13.620 --> 00:38:17.530\nJust like in Debian, we have software\ngroups under SentOS and Redhat.\n\n751\n00:38:17.530 --> 00:38:20.880\nIt's asking us to pick which\nsoftware group we want.\n\n752\n00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:24.460\nThe default is desktop, and I'll tell you,\nit installs a lot of software.\n\n753\n00:38:24.460 --> 00:38:27.480\nA full GUI, open office,\na bunch of other stuff.\n\n754\n00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:31.050\nSo software that we may or may not need,\nespecially not on a server.\n\n755\n00:38:31.050 --> 00:38:34.530\nSo on a server we normally want\nto start with next to nothing.\n\n756\n00:38:34.530 --> 00:38:36.750\nA bare minimum install, and\n\n757\n00:38:36.750 --> 00:38:40.540\nthen we'll add the things that we\nwant if we need them, all right.\n\n758\n00:38:40.540 --> 00:38:44.690\nAnd so you'll see minimal\ndesktop that still has a GUI.\n\n759\n00:38:44.690 --> 00:38:47.550\nBut it's pruned off a lot of\nthe extra third party software.\n\n760\n00:38:47.550 --> 00:38:49.330\nThere's minimal outright.\n\n761\n00:38:49.330 --> 00:38:52.490\nThat includes no GUI,\nyou've gotta add the stuff you want.\n\n762\n00:38:52.490 --> 00:38:57.210\nThere's basic server, that's a server\nthat does have a GUI, database server,\n\n763\n00:38:57.210 --> 00:39:01.850\nweb server kind of self explanatory on\nthose software development work station.\n\n764\n00:39:01.850 --> 00:39:04.410\nThat includes the compiler and\nthe source code for the kernel,\n\n765\n00:39:04.410 --> 00:39:06.460\nall that other good stuff is in there.\n\n766\n00:39:06.460 --> 00:39:09.120\nSo you've got several different\nchoices to pick from,\n\n767\n00:39:09.120 --> 00:39:12.880\nremember whichever one you choose, you can\nalways add and remove packages later, so\n\n768\n00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:14.940\nyou can kind of move between these.\n\n769\n00:39:14.940 --> 00:39:19.140\nI'm just going to do a straight\nup minimal install, all right?\n\n770\n00:39:19.140 --> 00:39:22.638\nDown here,\nwe have what are called repositories.\n\n771\n00:39:22.638 --> 00:39:26.527\nCentOS uses repositories where they store\nall the various updates and packages,\n\n772\n00:39:26.527 --> 00:39:29.636\nthey're hosted on we web,\nthey're just FTP servers normally.\n\n773\n00:39:29.636 --> 00:39:34.740\nYou can connect to and download updated\npackages from or new packages, all right.\n\n774\n00:39:34.740 --> 00:39:39.523\nThe default repository is the CentOS one\nand it has all of the approved software\n\n775\n00:39:39.523 --> 00:39:44.108\nthat's gone through Redhat's testing and\nvetting process, all right.\n\n776\n00:39:44.108 --> 00:39:47.448\nWhat if you want some software that\nhasn't been approved yet, right?\n\n777\n00:39:47.448 --> 00:39:52.348\nThere's a web-based server\nmanagement utility called WebAdmin.\n\n778\n00:39:52.348 --> 00:39:54.988\nRight, it's not in\nthe regular repositories.\n\n779\n00:39:54.988 --> 00:39:59.249\nSo if you want you can actually add\nother software repositories here and\n\n780\n00:39:59.249 --> 00:40:00.888\nyou can pull down updates.\n\n781\n00:40:00.888 --> 00:40:04.386\nSo if you want the latest version of\nPHP or the latest version of Java and\n\n782\n00:40:04.386 --> 00:40:08.530\nit's not in the repositories, you can\noverride it if you want, all right?\n\n783\n00:40:08.530 --> 00:40:10.580\nNow if stability is what you want,\n\n784\n00:40:10.580 --> 00:40:14.040\nif support from Red Hat is what you\nwant you don't mess with that, right?\n\n785\n00:40:14.040 --> 00:40:16.300\nBut if you're just trying to\nget the latest software for\n\n786\n00:40:16.300 --> 00:40:19.070\ntesting, it is useful to\nadd in other repositories.\n\n787\n00:40:19.070 --> 00:40:22.170\nAll right, so I'll go ahead and hit next.\n\n788\n00:40:23.740 --> 00:40:26.820\nAnd now it's ready to do our install,\nso it's gonna crank up and\n\n789\n00:40:26.820 --> 00:40:29.480\nthat should be all it needs\nfrom me as far as input.\n\n790\n00:40:29.480 --> 00:40:31.820\nNow it's gonna start\ninstalling all the packages.\n\n791\n00:40:31.820 --> 00:40:35.530\nAnd since I did a minimal install,\nit should happen fairly quickly, so\n\n792\n00:40:35.530 --> 00:40:37.290\nit's just gonna turn along here.\n\n793\n00:40:37.290 --> 00:40:39.760\nIt's got 217 packages to install.\n\n794\n00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:42.330\nWe don't have to sit here and watch it,\nwhy don't we do this, Ronnie,\n\n795\n00:40:42.330 --> 00:40:43.440\nwhy don't we stop and take a break?\n\n796\n00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:44.690\n>> Sounds good.\n>> And then when we get back,\n\n797\n00:40:44.690 --> 00:40:47.560\nthe install should be done, and we can\ntake a look at what's going on there.\n\n798\n00:40:47.560 --> 00:40:50.898\nSo we'll just leave it doing its thing,\nand we'll boot back up in a minute.\n\n799\n00:40:50.898 --> 00:40:53.118\nSo stay tuned, we'll be back after this.\n\n800\n00:40:53.118 --> 00:41:00.278\n[MUSIC]\n\n801\n00:41:00.278 --> 00:41:02.020\nAll right, welcome back, everybody.\n\n802\n00:41:02.020 --> 00:41:04.000\nSo we let the installer\nkind of churn along.\n\n803\n00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:07.475\nIt's done now, and once it's done,\nit just displays a simple screen.\n\n804\n00:41:07.475 --> 00:41:11.370\nWhich I've got it pulled up here,\njust kind of showing us, hey you're done.\n\n805\n00:41:11.370 --> 00:41:14.090\nAnd you've got one button you can hit\nwhich it reboot and that's about it.\n\n806\n00:41:14.090 --> 00:41:16.590\nSo we'll go ahead and\nhit that and we're gonna reboot.\n\n807\n00:41:16.590 --> 00:41:19.670\nYou'll see the anaconda\ninstaller ending right there.\n\n808\n00:41:19.670 --> 00:41:21.680\nAnd that's gonna reboot.\n\n809\n00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:25.540\nAnd when it's done,\nnow it's gonna skip the DVD right so\n\n810\n00:41:25.540 --> 00:41:27.930\nyou know that's kind of what\nit was doing right there.\n\n811\n00:41:27.930 --> 00:41:30.620\nAnd then it's gonna go and\nboot from the actual system.\n\n812\n00:41:30.620 --> 00:41:32.690\nI got my little warning\nunsupported hardware.\n\n813\n00:41:32.690 --> 00:41:36.390\nI'm going to continue to give that warning\nuntil I install the VMware editions.\n\n814\n00:41:36.390 --> 00:41:38.000\nYou wouldn't see that\non a physical machine.\n\n815\n00:41:39.270 --> 00:41:43.090\nJust like in the Debian show\nwhen I did the install,\n\n816\n00:41:43.090 --> 00:41:45.860\nI chose to do a minimal install so\nI don't get a GUI.\n\n817\n00:41:45.860 --> 00:41:50.148\nHad I done it I'd get a nice little GUI\nhere and have that chance to move forward.\n\n818\n00:41:50.148 --> 00:41:52.165\nWhich I should probably boot\nit up in the background.\n\n819\n00:41:52.165 --> 00:41:56.857\nI've got an install parked around here\nsomewhere that has the graphical user\n\n820\n00:41:56.857 --> 00:42:00.490\ninterface, I think it's this\nmachine that I did that on.\n\n821\n00:42:00.490 --> 00:42:01.702\nLet's see.\n\n822\n00:42:01.702 --> 00:42:07.580\nAll right, you know what, I'll leave this\nkind of booting up in the background,\n\n823\n00:42:08.820 --> 00:42:12.562\nbecause I don't want to sit here and\nwait on that, and go back to this one.\n\n824\n00:42:12.562 --> 00:42:15.480\nAll right, so we'll get a chance to see\nthat graphical user interface here in\n\n825\n00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:20.980\na minute but on the minimal install,\nyou can boot up to a text entry.\n\n826\n00:42:20.980 --> 00:42:22.190\nAnd so I can login.\n\n827\n00:42:22.190 --> 00:42:24.650\nNow, remember during\nthe installer of Debian,\n\n828\n00:42:24.650 --> 00:42:27.410\nwe had it create a second user for me.\n\n829\n00:42:27.410 --> 00:42:29.300\nThe CentOS installer did not.\n\n830\n00:42:29.300 --> 00:42:33.960\nSo if I want a second user,\nI have to create it myself But for me,\n\n831\n00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:36.010\nI'm just gonna log in here as root.\n\n832\n00:42:36.010 --> 00:42:39.050\nAnd normally your first job as\nroot is to create another user, so\n\n833\n00:42:39.050 --> 00:42:40.370\nyou don't have to use root.\n\n834\n00:42:40.370 --> 00:42:42.530\nAnd we'll see that in\nthe security episode.\n\n835\n00:42:42.530 --> 00:42:45.130\nBut for now, I'll go ahead and\nget logged in.\n\n836\n00:42:45.130 --> 00:42:47.380\nAnd I can see I'm in the machine-\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n837\n00:42:47.380 --> 00:42:48.276\n>> Now what?\n\n838\n00:42:48.276 --> 00:42:51.140\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Well, just like I said in that other\n\n839\n00:42:51.140 --> 00:42:55.520\nepisode, to me the install is not\ndone until the system is up to date.\n\n840\n00:42:55.520 --> 00:42:59.308\nThat DVD that ISO that we downloaded,\nwell it's probably all ready out of date.\n\n841\n00:42:59.308 --> 00:43:02.023\nThere's probably new updates that\nhave come out since then, so\n\n842\n00:43:02.023 --> 00:43:04.398\nit's a good idea to bring our\nsystem current all right.\n\n843\n00:43:04.398 --> 00:43:08.530\nBut like Ronnie pointed out, by default\nwhen we can bring our system up,\n\n844\n00:43:08.530 --> 00:43:12.155\nthe network card is most\nlikely not operational, okay?\n\n845\n00:43:12.155 --> 00:43:13.335\nAnd I could test that.\n\n846\n00:43:13.335 --> 00:43:16.705\nIf I try and\nping somebody out there on the Internet,\n\n847\n00:43:16.705 --> 00:43:18.985\nI just immediately get\nnetwork is unreachable.\n\n848\n00:43:18.985 --> 00:43:21.945\nAnd that's because unlike Debian,\nwhere the network card was activated\n\n849\n00:43:21.945 --> 00:43:25.500\nby default as part of\nthe install in CentOS, it isn't.\n\n850\n00:43:25.500 --> 00:43:29.190\nAnd that's because they're assuming you're\ngonna be using this for servers, and\n\n851\n00:43:29.190 --> 00:43:32.250\nthat means that you need to take extra\nprecautions and you might wanna get things\n\n852\n00:43:32.250 --> 00:43:34.740\nconfigured and secure before\nyou connect it to the network.\n\n853\n00:43:34.740 --> 00:43:36.610\nSo that's kinda why it does that.\n\n854\n00:43:36.610 --> 00:43:39.300\nSo I'm gonna enable\nthe network adapter real fast.\n\n855\n00:43:39.300 --> 00:43:43.850\nNow if you've never worked with Linux\nbefore and this is your first taste of it,\n\n856\n00:43:43.850 --> 00:43:46.040\nI'm gonna use a few commands here\nthat we haven't learned yet.\n\n857\n00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:50.266\nAll right and we will spend some time on\nthem a little bit later, but I just need\n\n858\n00:43:50.266 --> 00:43:54.710\nto get in and modify a little file to tell\nit how I want the network card to operate.\n\n859\n00:43:54.710 --> 00:43:59.720\nSo I'm gonna do that real quick, just to\nget us kinda up and going and in place.\n\n860\n00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:01.990\nI need to edit a little\nfile on the system.\n\n861\n00:44:03.310 --> 00:44:06.630\nSo I'm gonna use a text editor called Vi.\n\n862\n00:44:06.630 --> 00:44:10.070\nThere are many text editors\navailable in Linux.\n\n863\n00:44:10.070 --> 00:44:14.506\nAnd you'll hear a lot of people on the\nInternet say I love Nano, or I love Vim,\n\n864\n00:44:14.506 --> 00:44:16.908\nor whatever, but Vi is the original one.\n\n865\n00:44:16.908 --> 00:44:20.467\nIt's been around for\n30 some odd years now, and\n\n866\n00:44:20.467 --> 00:44:25.889\nit's the only one that you pretty much\nknow is going to be on any UNIX system,\n\n867\n00:44:25.889 --> 00:44:30.418\nso if you use nano, well nano will\nbe there on a Red Hat install.\n\n868\n00:44:30.418 --> 00:44:31.645\nIt may not be there on Debian,\n\n869\n00:44:31.645 --> 00:44:34.280\nactually it's not gonna be\nthere on a Debian install.\n\n870\n00:44:34.280 --> 00:44:38.220\nSame thing with Vim, since I did a minimal\ninstall, Vim probably isn't there.\n\n871\n00:44:38.220 --> 00:44:42.390\nLet's see if it is, yeah so\nVim's not there, Nano's not there.\n\n872\n00:44:42.390 --> 00:44:46.100\nSo some of these installs, some of\nthese text editors aren't available.\n\n873\n00:44:46.100 --> 00:44:50.438\nSo if you learn Vi, yeah it's harder,\nit's not very intuitive.\n\n874\n00:44:50.438 --> 00:44:53.908\nBut it's the one you know\nis going to be available so\n\n875\n00:44:53.908 --> 00:44:58.913\nI'm gonna use Vi to edit this file that\nbasically controls the network and\n\n876\n00:44:58.913 --> 00:45:03.915\nso I just need to reach in there and\ndo this and don't be intimidated by this\n\n877\n00:45:03.915 --> 00:45:08.838\none like I said we are going to be\nlearning more about this in later shows,\n\n878\n00:45:08.838 --> 00:45:12.549\nbut basically there's a script\nfile called if cfg, or\n\n879\n00:45:12.549 --> 00:45:17.280\ninterface configuration that\ncontrols my network adapter.\n\n880\n00:45:17.280 --> 00:45:20.610\nAnd it controls what happens\nwhen the computer boots up.\n\n881\n00:45:20.610 --> 00:45:23.750\nAnd so you can see ONBOOT=no.\n\n882\n00:45:23.750 --> 00:45:27.530\nSo when the system boots up, this\nnetwork adapter is actually turned off.\n\n883\n00:45:27.530 --> 00:45:31.090\nAnd so I just need to change some\nof the values in here a little bit.\n\n884\n00:45:31.090 --> 00:45:37.120\nSo I'm gonna change that ONBOOT to yes,\nso it'd be on when we boot up.\n\n885\n00:45:37.120 --> 00:45:39.920\nI want that boot protocol to be DHCP.\n\n886\n00:45:39.920 --> 00:45:42.244\nAnd let's see, is that about it?\n\n887\n00:45:42.244 --> 00:45:43.260\nHere.\n\n888\n00:45:43.260 --> 00:45:45.440\nNetwork manager controlled.\n\n889\n00:45:45.440 --> 00:45:47.390\nIf you do the graphical user interface,\n\n890\n00:45:47.390 --> 00:45:49.770\nthere's a little program\ncalled network manager.\n\n891\n00:45:49.770 --> 00:45:51.340\nAnd you use that to\nconfigure network apps.\n\n892\n00:45:51.340 --> 00:45:52.385\nAnd it works great, right?\n\n893\n00:45:52.385 --> 00:45:53.308\nBut-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n894\n00:45:53.308 --> 00:45:55.500\n>> On a text-based install like this.\n\n895\n00:45:55.500 --> 00:46:00.470\nI don't have the network manager, and so\nI'm just gonna change that to say no so\n\n896\n00:46:00.470 --> 00:46:04.560\nthat it knows that it's actually being\ncontrolled by us manually, all right.\n\n897\n00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:09.800\nSo now it's gonna boot up and it's gonna\nget a DHCP address when it runs, okay.\n\n898\n00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:12.260\nSo I've got a couple of choices from here.\n\n899\n00:46:12.260 --> 00:46:13.870\nI could just reboot the computer.\n\n900\n00:46:13.870 --> 00:46:15.670\nAnd it'll get a DHCP address.\n\n901\n00:46:15.670 --> 00:46:18.600\nBut to save time I'm just gonna\nrestart the networking service,\n\n902\n00:46:18.600 --> 00:46:20.380\ncuz that's a little bit faster.\n\n903\n00:46:20.380 --> 00:46:24.590\nI am gonna tell it,\nthat in the future when it boots up,\n\n904\n00:46:24.590 --> 00:46:26.280\nto leave the network adapter enabled.\n\n905\n00:46:29.480 --> 00:46:31.800\nSo I'll use the chkconfig command for\nthat.\n\n906\n00:46:31.800 --> 00:46:35.450\nSo now, every time I'd boot up from\nnow on, the network will be enabled.\n\n907\n00:46:35.450 --> 00:46:38.565\nAnd then I'm just gonna say,\nservice network restart and\n\n908\n00:46:38.565 --> 00:46:40.928\nthat'll restart the network that happen.\n\n909\n00:46:44.428 --> 00:46:46.388\nAll right now the moment of truth.\n\n910\n00:46:46.388 --> 00:46:51.050\n[LAUGH] So now it should have gotten\nan IP address and it should be happy.\n\n911\n00:46:51.050 --> 00:46:54.700\nNow Ronnie mentioned a very valid point\nduring the install I could have checked\n\n912\n00:46:54.700 --> 00:46:57.910\nthat box to say yeah turn it on I'm\nbooting and get a DHCP address and\n\n913\n00:46:57.910 --> 00:46:58.550\nbe happy right.\n\n914\n00:46:58.550 --> 00:47:00.650\nAnd then we wouldn't of\nhad to of done this.\n\n915\n00:47:00.650 --> 00:47:05.740\nBut if I was in the text-based minimal\ninstaller, you don't have that option.\n\n916\n00:47:05.740 --> 00:47:09.590\nSo I like to show this, because,\nif you're building up a minimal server to\n\n917\n00:47:09.590 --> 00:47:12.620\nkeep it as secure as possible, you're\ngonna have to do exactly what I just did.\n\n918\n00:47:12.620 --> 00:47:15.270\nIn fact, you'll probably have to\ndo a little more because I set\n\n919\n00:47:15.270 --> 00:47:18.516\nthis one to DHCP,\nyou'll probably wanna do a static IP.\n\n920\n00:47:18.516 --> 00:47:21.380\nSo you'll have to put the IP address,\nand default gateway, DNS servers,\n\n921\n00:47:21.380 --> 00:47:22.790\nall that other stuff in there.\n\n922\n00:47:22.790 --> 00:47:26.550\nAnd so that is something that\nI'm kinda used to doing.\n\n923\n00:47:26.550 --> 00:47:29.490\nI'll post that with the show notes,\nso you'll know what I just did,\n\n924\n00:47:29.490 --> 00:47:31.710\nas far a commands,\ncuz it is kinda useful to know.\n\n925\n00:47:31.710 --> 00:47:35.704\nAll right, but now I should be able\nto ping out to the old Internet, and\n\n926\n00:47:35.704 --> 00:47:36.398\nI sure can.\n\n927\n00:47:39.304 --> 00:47:44.391\nAll right, so my point of doing that was\nto be able to connect to the Internet so\n\n928\n00:47:44.391 --> 00:47:48.488\nI can check my system to make\nsure it's up to date, all right?\n\n929\n00:47:48.488 --> 00:47:51.708\nUnder Debian we learned about\ntwo utilities, apt-get,\n\n930\n00:47:51.708 --> 00:47:56.056\nwhich was the most common, and then\nthe older dpkg or Debian package manager.\n\n931\n00:47:56.056 --> 00:47:59.843\nAll right, well,\nunder Red Hat based operating systems,\n\n932\n00:47:59.843 --> 00:48:01.898\nlike CentOS, we have two also.\n\n933\n00:48:01.898 --> 00:48:04.800\nWe have yum, Y-U-M.\n\n934\n00:48:04.800 --> 00:48:06.710\nYum, which is the most common.\n\n935\n00:48:06.710 --> 00:48:10.605\nAnd we have rpm,\nthe Red Hat Package Manager.\n\n936\n00:48:10.605 --> 00:48:11.875\nSo rpm is the older one.\n\n937\n00:48:11.875 --> 00:48:15.115\nThey're both still supported,\nyou can actually use either one.\n\n938\n00:48:15.115 --> 00:48:17.595\nBoth of them provide\nthe same basic feature set.\n\n939\n00:48:17.595 --> 00:48:20.555\nIn fact, rpm actually has a few\nextra features that yum doesn't,\n\n940\n00:48:20.555 --> 00:48:23.240\nbut they're features that\nmost people never need.\n\n941\n00:48:23.240 --> 00:48:27.790\nSo yum is gonna be your go-to utility,\nand it's cooler to say.\n\n942\n00:48:27.790 --> 00:48:29.825\n[LAUGH] So\nif I want to do updates on my system,\n\n943\n00:48:29.825 --> 00:48:32.140\nthose are the utilities\nI'm gonna be relying on.\n\n944\n00:48:32.140 --> 00:48:33.860\n>> And Don,\ndid you remember what yum stands for?\n\n945\n00:48:35.090 --> 00:48:37.730\nIt's weird.\n>> Isn't it the Yellow Dog Update Manager\n\n946\n00:48:37.730 --> 00:48:38.350\nor something like that?\n\n947\n00:48:38.350 --> 00:48:40.960\n>> Yeah, I don't know exactly\nwhy they call it Yellow Dog, but\n\n948\n00:48:40.960 --> 00:48:42.640\nI thought it was neat.\n\n949\n00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:44.660\nCuz I was like,\nwhy would we ever type in yum?\n\n950\n00:48:44.660 --> 00:48:48.230\n>> So [LAUGH] don't quote me on this, but\nas I remember, there's Yellow Dog Linux,\n\n951\n00:48:48.230 --> 00:48:51.329\nwhich was the special version of\nLinux that was originally designed to\n\n952\n00:48:51.329 --> 00:48:52.070\nrun on Macs.\n\n953\n00:48:52.070 --> 00:48:53.070\n>> Right.\n\n954\n00:48:53.070 --> 00:48:55.390\n>> And apparently, that's where\nthe update manager was developed.\n\n955\n00:48:55.390 --> 00:48:59.170\nAnd then it went upstream and\nmade it into Red Hat.\n\n956\n00:48:59.170 --> 00:49:00.220\nThat's my understanding.\n\n957\n00:49:00.220 --> 00:49:03.810\nI could be wrong, but\nyeah, it's a bizarre one.\n\n958\n00:49:03.810 --> 00:49:05.430\nAll right, so, let's see.\n\n959\n00:49:05.430 --> 00:49:09.780\nSo if I wanna make a user yum, because\nthat is the one I'm normally going to use,\n\n960\n00:49:09.780 --> 00:49:12.180\nthe syntax is really pretty simple.\n\n961\n00:49:12.180 --> 00:49:15.946\nI can use it to update as\nwell as install packages.\n\n962\n00:49:15.946 --> 00:49:22.370\nIf I wanna do an update, we just run\nyum update and that's it, right?\n\n963\n00:49:22.370 --> 00:49:27.130\nIf we want to install a single or update a\nsingle package we would say yum update and\n\n964\n00:49:27.130 --> 00:49:28.760\nthen the name of that package.\n\n965\n00:49:28.760 --> 00:49:31.000\nSo maybe I wanted samba, right?\n\n966\n00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:34.432\nAnd so I would say yum update samba, and\nit would just update that one package,\n\n967\n00:49:34.432 --> 00:49:35.280\nall right?\n\n968\n00:49:35.280 --> 00:49:39.580\nBut since I just did an install, I\nprobably need to update a lot more, right?\n\n969\n00:49:39.580 --> 00:49:44.550\nSo I could just run yum update and\nit's gonna reach out to the CentOS\n\n970\n00:49:44.550 --> 00:49:48.530\nrepositories, right, the repositories\nare where these updates are stored.\n\n971\n00:49:48.530 --> 00:49:52.620\nAnd it's gonna look at what's on the\nrepository and compare it to what's on my\n\n972\n00:49:52.620 --> 00:49:58.350\nmachine, and then it's gonna give me a\nlist of what's new, what's updated, okay?\n\n973\n00:49:58.350 --> 00:50:03.250\nNow I'm running CentOS 6.5 right now,\nwhich has been out for a long time,\n\n974\n00:50:03.250 --> 00:50:05.160\nright, has it been a year now?\n\n975\n00:50:05.160 --> 00:50:06.370\nIt's been out a while.\n\n976\n00:50:06.370 --> 00:50:08.900\nSo there's definitely\ngoing to be some updates.\n\n977\n00:50:08.900 --> 00:50:13.310\nIn the Debian show, I used 7.5, which\nhad only been out for a few weeks, and\n\n978\n00:50:13.310 --> 00:50:17.330\nthere's only one update that I was able\nto find on it for a default install.\n\n979\n00:50:17.330 --> 00:50:20.620\nSo for this one,\nI expect to see a lot more.\n\n980\n00:50:20.620 --> 00:50:23.360\nSo when I run yum update,\nit's looking for a mirror.\n\n981\n00:50:23.360 --> 00:50:26.130\nIt's taking a look at\nthe database at the mirror,\n\n982\n00:50:26.130 --> 00:50:28.430\nright, looking at what updates are there.\n\n983\n00:50:28.430 --> 00:50:32.380\nAnd then it's gonna compare what I\nhave against that and give me a nice,\n\n984\n00:50:32.380 --> 00:50:33.790\nbig list, right?\n\n985\n00:50:33.790 --> 00:50:34.630\nEventually.\n\n986\n00:50:34.630 --> 00:50:37.210\nSo, we'll give it a second there.\n\n987\n00:50:37.210 --> 00:50:40.640\nYeah, so it looks like there's 47 updates.\n\n988\n00:50:40.640 --> 00:50:41.680\nThat might sound like a lot.\n\n989\n00:50:41.680 --> 00:50:45.950\nIt's a total of 89 megs, so\nit's not a big chunk of data.\n\n990\n00:50:45.950 --> 00:50:47.950\nAnd now I get the choice to do the update.\n\n991\n00:50:47.950 --> 00:50:50.800\nIf I say yes,\nit's gonna do the update, right?\n\n992\n00:50:50.800 --> 00:50:52.950\nIf I say no, then it'll stop and\nthat's the end of it.\n\n993\n00:50:52.950 --> 00:50:55.940\nSo normally, I would say yes,\nbut it is gonna be quite a bit.\n\n994\n00:50:55.940 --> 00:50:59.870\nSo maybe I'll pick one of these\nindividual ones to update,\n\n995\n00:50:59.870 --> 00:51:01.870\nlet's update openssl, right?\n\n996\n00:51:01.870 --> 00:51:05.880\nSo I can see that I've got 1.0.1e,\nwhich is,\n\n997\n00:51:05.880 --> 00:51:07.585\nI believe that's Heartbleed susceptible.\n\n998\n00:51:07.585 --> 00:51:09.570\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Well, it's sub really 16,\n\n999\n00:51:09.570 --> 00:51:10.790\nI think I was safe.\n\n1000\n00:51:10.790 --> 00:51:13.370\nI'd have to double check to\nsee if that one's safe, but\n\n1001\n00:51:13.370 --> 00:51:16.570\nthis one might be\nsusceptible to Heartbleed.\n\n1002\n00:51:16.570 --> 00:51:20.550\nSo I could update just openssl,\nright, I'm gonna say no to that.\n\n1003\n00:51:20.550 --> 00:51:25.170\nAnd I'll say yum update openssl, okay?\n\n1004\n00:51:25.170 --> 00:51:30.245\nAnd now,\nit's gonna look at that individual one,\n\n1005\n00:51:30.245 --> 00:51:37.572\nand it's gonna see that I've\ngot 1.0.1e release el6_5.14.\n\n1006\n00:51:37.572 --> 00:51:42.829\nOr no, I've got just el6 and then the most\nrecent one to download is el6_5.14,\n\n1007\n00:51:42.829 --> 00:51:47.295\nwhich you can pretty much guarantee\nis one that's gonna fix Heartbleed,\n\n1008\n00:51:47.295 --> 00:51:48.750\nso I need to apply that.\n\n1009\n00:51:48.750 --> 00:51:49.749\nI'll go ahead and say yes.\n\n1010\n00:51:51.490 --> 00:51:53.650\nAnd it's gonna apply the update just for\nthat package.\n\n1011\n00:51:53.650 --> 00:51:57.714\nNow if there's other things\nthat depended on this package,\n\n1012\n00:51:57.714 --> 00:52:00.110\nit would update them also, right?\n\n1013\n00:52:00.110 --> 00:52:03.180\nSo it definitely gives you that\nlittle safety net there, so\n\n1014\n00:52:03.180 --> 00:52:05.140\nyou don't break one package\nby updating another.\n\n1015\n00:52:05.140 --> 00:52:06.290\nAll right.\n\n1016\n00:52:06.290 --> 00:52:10.210\nNow since this is the first time it's\nupdated, it's letting me know that it just\n\n1017\n00:52:10.210 --> 00:52:15.770\ndownloaded a certificate to do validation.\n\n1018\n00:52:15.770 --> 00:52:17.650\nAnd I just downloaded\nthat from the repository,\n\n1019\n00:52:17.650 --> 00:52:20.020\nit's asking me if I trust that, all right.\n\n1020\n00:52:20.020 --> 00:52:25.150\nDo I trust this key for validating\nthat server is who they say they are?\n\n1021\n00:52:25.150 --> 00:52:28.650\nIt's a good idea to run these against\nthe MD5 checksums on the server itself,\n\n1022\n00:52:28.650 --> 00:52:29.690\njust to validate.\n\n1023\n00:52:29.690 --> 00:52:32.890\nIn my case, I know this hasn't been\ntampered with cuz I downloaded the ISO\n\n1024\n00:52:32.890 --> 00:52:34.860\nmyself and validated it.\n\n1025\n00:52:34.860 --> 00:52:36.760\nSo I'll go ahead and say yes to that.\n\n1026\n00:52:36.760 --> 00:52:37.790\nI trust it.\n\n1027\n00:52:37.790 --> 00:52:40.370\nAnd now it's reaching out there and\ndoing the update.\n\n1028\n00:52:40.370 --> 00:52:42.180\nSo you'll see it does the update,\n\n1029\n00:52:42.180 --> 00:52:45.110\nit then cleans up the old\nfiles that aren't needed.\n\n1030\n00:52:45.110 --> 00:52:47.500\nAnd then it verifies\nthe update took effect.\n\n1031\n00:52:47.500 --> 00:52:50.270\nAnd so I can see sure enough,\nit's updated.\n\n1032\n00:52:50.270 --> 00:52:52.415\nNow I'm running the latest\nversion of openssl.\n\n1033\n00:52:54.955 --> 00:52:57.545\nIf we wanna add something that's\nnot already there, right?\n\n1034\n00:52:57.545 --> 00:52:59.165\nI mentioned samba, right?\n\n1035\n00:52:59.165 --> 00:53:03.575\nWe can say yum install samba, and\n\n1036\n00:53:03.575 --> 00:53:07.952\nthat'll reach out and download\nthe samba features or the samba tools.\n\n1037\n00:53:07.952 --> 00:53:10.742\nNotice samba has a lot of dependencies.\n\n1038\n00:53:10.742 --> 00:53:14.012\nSo, it's listing all of the different\ndependencies there that it's got.\n\n1039\n00:53:14.012 --> 00:53:16.082\nSo, to install this,\nit's going to be a ton of stuff.\n\n1040\n00:53:16.082 --> 00:53:18.534\nMaybe I'll pick something simpler,\nlets do vim.\n\n1041\n00:53:18.534 --> 00:53:20.752\nI think I did vim on the Debian show.\n\n1042\n00:53:20.752 --> 00:53:25.472\nSo if I say yum install vim,\nthat's a little bit better,\n\n1043\n00:53:25.472 --> 00:53:27.242\n18 megs, just a handful of packages.\n\n1044\n00:53:27.242 --> 00:53:30.321\nIt looks like it's dependent on perl,\nso it's gonna download perl and\n\n1045\n00:53:30.321 --> 00:53:31.430\nits libraries.\n\n1046\n00:53:31.430 --> 00:53:33.640\nAnd so I can go in and say yes to that.\n\n1047\n00:53:33.640 --> 00:53:34.680\nAnd now it's gonna install vim.\n\n1048\n00:53:34.680 --> 00:53:38.885\nNow you can see where if you're setting\nup a server that you want to be secure,\n\n1049\n00:53:38.885 --> 00:53:40.257\nyou might not want perl.\n\n1050\n00:53:40.257 --> 00:53:44.540\nYou might not want an extra\nexecution library on your system.\n\n1051\n00:53:44.540 --> 00:53:48.260\nBecause now that opens you up to potential\nattacks that require perl, right?\n\n1052\n00:53:48.260 --> 00:53:50.570\nSo if I just use the vye\neditor instead of vim,\n\n1053\n00:53:50.570 --> 00:53:52.945\nI wouldn't have to worry about this,\nright?\n\n1054\n00:53:52.945 --> 00:53:57.510\nSo, it goes back to that thing that I\nwas saying is, you want to learn vye.\n\n1055\n00:53:57.510 --> 00:53:59.230\nThat's the one to stick with.\n\n1056\n00:53:59.230 --> 00:54:03.060\nVim has pretty colors, so\na lot of people like it better.\n\n1057\n00:54:03.060 --> 00:54:05.720\nAll right, I'll say yes to\ninstall that and there it goes.\n\n1058\n00:54:07.090 --> 00:54:11.286\nAll right, and if I had been running vim\nfor a while and I wanted to do an update,\n\n1059\n00:54:11.286 --> 00:54:13.524\nI could always just say, yum update vim.\n\n1060\n00:54:16.078 --> 00:54:19.266\nAll right,\nif I'm not connected to the Internet,\n\n1061\n00:54:19.266 --> 00:54:22.070\nI can do installs from\na local file if I want.\n\n1062\n00:54:22.070 --> 00:54:26.220\nI can say yum local install and\nthen a package name.\n\n1063\n00:54:26.220 --> 00:54:28.720\nThe only problem there is\nthe dependency checking.\n\n1064\n00:54:28.720 --> 00:54:31.920\nYou have to have all the dependent\npackages also, and that can be a little\n\n1065\n00:54:31.920 --> 00:54:35.300\nbit challenging sometimes to identify\nall the dependencies yourself.\n\n1066\n00:54:35.300 --> 00:54:40.088\nSo it's kind of nice to be connected\nto a network and get it this way.\n\n1067\n00:54:40.088 --> 00:54:41.249\nAll right.\n\n1068\n00:54:41.249 --> 00:54:46.469\nIf you don't know a package name, so\nmaybe you know you wanna install mysql.\n\n1069\n00:54:46.469 --> 00:54:50.695\nBut you don't know exactly\nwhich package you want,\n\n1070\n00:54:50.695 --> 00:54:56.380\nyou can do a yum list, and then you\ncan punch in like mysql, like that.\n\n1071\n00:54:56.380 --> 00:55:00.270\nAnd it'll list any packages\nthat contain mysql, right?\n\n1072\n00:55:00.270 --> 00:55:04.090\nAnd so it's gonna reach out there and give\nme a list, and there was just one, right?\n\n1073\n00:55:04.090 --> 00:55:07.840\nWell, there's a problem because there\nare more packages that contain it.\n\n1074\n00:55:07.840 --> 00:55:10.910\nIt's just this one was a perfect match and\nso that's how it listed.\n\n1075\n00:55:10.910 --> 00:55:14.940\nIf I stick a wild card\non there like mysql*,\n\n1076\n00:55:14.940 --> 00:55:18.130\nwhen I run that,\nI can see there's a lot more, all right.\n\n1077\n00:55:18.130 --> 00:55:21.109\nSo be careful when you do a search,\nif there's a perfect match,\n\n1078\n00:55:21.109 --> 00:55:22.721\nthat's all it's gonna show you.\n\n1079\n00:55:22.721 --> 00:55:27.469\nAnd then after that,\nyou might want just the mysql connector,\n\n1080\n00:55:27.469 --> 00:55:32.020\nright, or mysql embedded,\nmysql server, mysql test.\n\n1081\n00:55:32.020 --> 00:55:35.692\nThere's different ones there that you\nmay want that aren't quite what you\n\n1082\n00:55:35.692 --> 00:55:36.458\nsearched for.\n\n1083\n00:55:36.458 --> 00:55:39.849\nThe other thing is mysql might\nnot be in the beginning,\n\n1084\n00:55:39.849 --> 00:55:43.828\nso for example, if I want the pair\nlibraries from mysql, well,\n\n1085\n00:55:43.828 --> 00:55:47.684\nmysql net is actually located\nin the middle of that file name.\n\n1086\n00:55:47.684 --> 00:55:53.960\nSo if I do *mysql* I may get some\nother ones that I didn't see before.\n\n1087\n00:55:53.960 --> 00:55:58.420\nAnd actually, I don't see the pair,\ndid they scroll of my screen?\n\n1088\n00:55:58.420 --> 00:56:02.360\nI think we got more than what would fit on\nthe screen, let me pipe that into less.\n\n1089\n00:56:02.360 --> 00:56:07.020\nLet's see if we can find it, or\n\n1090\n00:56:07.020 --> 00:56:11.770\nit might just must not\nhave done a good search.\n\n1091\n00:56:11.770 --> 00:56:15.050\nYou can see some of the other\nthings that came up though,\n\n1092\n00:56:15.050 --> 00:56:17.210\nlike free radius,mysql and so on.\n\n1093\n00:56:17.210 --> 00:56:19.270\nSo, you might need to manipulate\nyour search a little bit,\n\n1094\n00:56:19.270 --> 00:56:21.610\nto find exactly what your looking for.\n\n1095\n00:56:21.610 --> 00:56:26.410\nAnd, all right apparently I don't know\nwhat's listed on the PEAR libraries,\n\n1096\n00:56:26.410 --> 00:56:27.763\nI picked a bad example.\n\n1097\n00:56:27.763 --> 00:56:32.110\n>> [LAUGH] But you can see quite a bit of\nthings in there, depending on your search.\n\n1098\n00:56:32.110 --> 00:56:36.700\nYou can find something like that, like\nLike a sequal light, so I want to install\n\n1099\n00:56:36.700 --> 00:56:42.860\nthe simple light version\nof an offline sql database.\n\n1100\n00:56:42.860 --> 00:56:45.860\nAnd so, we can then pull up a little\nmore information about that,\n\n1101\n00:56:45.860 --> 00:56:49.580\nif we want, by doing a list there.\n\n1102\n00:56:49.580 --> 00:56:53.230\nSo you can see what's available, what\nyou're running, if you have it and so on.\n\n1103\n00:56:53.230 --> 00:56:57.380\nSo, kind of neat little functions\nthere of Yum but usually for\n\n1104\n00:56:57.380 --> 00:57:01.745\nmost people,\nyou're simply running Yum update, right.\n\n1105\n00:57:01.745 --> 00:57:04.940\nOr, if you're confident that you\nknow you want all the updates,\n\n1106\n00:57:04.940 --> 00:57:06.720\nyou might do a yum dash y update.\n\n1107\n00:57:06.720 --> 00:57:10.000\nWhich says just go ahead and\nsay yes to that prompt to do the update,\n\n1108\n00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:12.760\ndon't bother me with it, just do it.\n\n1109\n00:57:12.760 --> 00:57:16.010\nSo that's probably the most common\ncommand that we're going to use.\n\n1110\n00:57:16.010 --> 00:57:21.590\nBut remember Yum install for the exam,\nas well as if we want to remove something.\n\n1111\n00:57:21.590 --> 00:57:22.850\nWhat did I install, Ronnie?\n\n1112\n00:57:22.850 --> 00:57:24.830\nI installed, did I install vim?\n\n1113\n00:57:24.830 --> 00:57:25.360\n>> Vim.\n\n1114\n00:57:25.360 --> 00:57:26.200\n>> I did, okay.\n\n1115\n00:57:26.200 --> 00:57:31.990\nSo if I want to get rid of vim,\nI would say, Yum remove vim, right.\n\n1116\n00:57:31.990 --> 00:57:33.960\nIf I want to get rid of it and\nthere it goes,\n\n1117\n00:57:33.960 --> 00:57:36.820\nit let's me know it's going to remove it,\nnow, notice what it's not doing.\n\n1118\n00:57:36.820 --> 00:57:38.660\nThe dependencies, right.\n\n1119\n00:57:38.660 --> 00:57:43.100\nI had to install some dependencies\nlike the Pearl libraries and\n\n1120\n00:57:43.100 --> 00:57:44.440\nit's not going to remove those.\n\n1121\n00:57:44.440 --> 00:57:47.880\nSo when you use remove,\nit is being very specific and\n\n1122\n00:57:47.880 --> 00:57:50.961\nnot necessarily getting those\ndependencies, so be careful with that.\n\n1123\n00:57:50.961 --> 00:57:54.916\nYou know,\nyou may need to remove a few other things,\n\n1124\n00:57:54.916 --> 00:57:59.057\nall right,\nfeel like I'm leaving something out, I am.\n\n1125\n00:57:59.057 --> 00:58:02.500\nAll right, when we did the install,\n\n1126\n00:58:02.500 --> 00:58:06.700\nremember in the installer it asked us at\none point, what software groups we wanted.\n\n1127\n00:58:06.700 --> 00:58:10.550\nAnd there was desktop and\nweb server and all those and I said,\n\n1128\n00:58:10.550 --> 00:58:12.860\nif you want them,\nyou could always add them later on.\n\n1129\n00:58:12.860 --> 00:58:16.170\nOr add and\nremove things if you needed to, well,\n\n1130\n00:58:16.170 --> 00:58:20.240\nthe way we do that, you saw Yum install.\n\n1131\n00:58:20.240 --> 00:58:24.680\nWe also have Yum group-install, okay.\n\n1132\n00:58:24.680 --> 00:58:27.990\nAnd that will allow us to add in\nsome of those software groups,\n\n1133\n00:58:27.990 --> 00:58:29.460\nif we want to after the fact.\n\n1134\n00:58:29.460 --> 00:58:33.470\nOr even to remove them,\nyou can do group-install to add a group,\n\n1135\n00:58:33.470 --> 00:58:36.720\ngroupremove to remove a group, all right.\n\n1136\n00:58:36.720 --> 00:58:37.660\nSo, I'd probably\n\n1137\n00:58:37.660 --> 00:58:40.750\nneed to start with group list because\nI have no idea what the names are.\n\n1138\n00:58:40.750 --> 00:58:42.470\nSo, if I do Yum grouplist,\n\n1139\n00:58:42.470 --> 00:58:44.460\nit'll give me a list of the software\ngroups that are available.\n\n1140\n00:58:44.460 --> 00:58:47.520\nAnd we should see the same ones that we\nsaw during the install unless they've\n\n1141\n00:58:47.520 --> 00:58:48.290\nadded some more.\n\n1142\n00:58:48.290 --> 00:58:51.560\nWhich it looks like they've added some\nmore because of all the languages,\n\n1143\n00:58:51.560 --> 00:58:55.830\nlanguage type,\nin something I can read, okay.\n\n1144\n00:58:55.830 --> 00:59:00.636\nSo, I see E-mail server, Perl Support and\nSecurity Tools are already installed.\n\n1145\n00:59:00.636 --> 00:59:04.240\nSo, those groups and I got Perl Support,\ncame with them and then,\n\n1146\n00:59:04.240 --> 00:59:05.250\nI see available groups.\n\n1147\n00:59:05.250 --> 00:59:07.720\nBack up server, back up client, base,\n\n1148\n00:59:07.720 --> 00:59:11.750\nbase we're going to have,\ndesktop, desktop platform.\n\n1149\n00:59:11.750 --> 00:59:15.400\nSo, there's actually a lot more here\nthan were in my installer, right and so,\n\n1150\n00:59:15.400 --> 00:59:16.460\nI can pick something here.\n\n1151\n00:59:16.460 --> 00:59:20.690\nBased on what it was that I wanted to do,\nso maybe I changed my mind and\n\n1152\n00:59:20.690 --> 00:59:23.680\nI do want a graphical user interface.\n\n1153\n00:59:23.680 --> 00:59:26.810\nAnd maybe I want KDE, so\nI see it right there, KDE Desktop.\n\n1154\n00:59:26.810 --> 00:59:31.520\nSo, I could pick that one or if I just do\nregular desktop, I think it does GNOME.\n\n1155\n00:59:31.520 --> 00:59:36.170\nSo, you can pick your group right here and\nthen your languages,\n\n1156\n00:59:36.170 --> 00:59:38.430\nif you wanna add in additional languages.\n\n1157\n00:59:38.430 --> 00:59:43.020\nSo I'm going to do groupinstall Desktop,\nall right.\n\n1158\n00:59:43.020 --> 00:59:48.070\nSo I've changed my mind about just being\na simple install, I want to do a desktop.\n\n1159\n00:59:48.070 --> 00:59:50.410\nWell, see what it just did?\n\n1160\n00:59:50.410 --> 00:59:51.438\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Two hundred and\n\n1161\n00:59:51.438 --> 00:59:53.600\nninety one packages 522\nmegs installed size,\n\n1162\n00:59:53.600 --> 00:59:55.570\nit's a lot of extra stuff to do that.\n\n1163\n00:59:55.570 --> 00:59:57.990\nSo you can start to see why,\nif we do a secure server,\n\n1164\n00:59:57.990 --> 00:59:59.340\nwe don't want all that extra stuff.\n\n1165\n00:59:59.340 --> 01:00:00.950\n>> Right.\n>> It's just too much, so\n\n1166\n01:00:00.950 --> 01:00:04.480\nthe streamlined simple install\nis better for a server install.\n\n1167\n01:00:06.280 --> 01:00:10.750\nAll right, I mentioned that I do have\na GUI based install if you want to see it.\n\n1168\n01:00:10.750 --> 01:00:14.080\nSo if we did the desktop install,\nthis is what it would look like.\n\n1169\n01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:19.330\nAnd if I log in here,\nwe'll see the fairly simple\n\n1170\n01:00:19.330 --> 01:00:23.520\nCent OS user interface, that's designed\nmuch like a lot of the other ones.\n\n1171\n01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:26.580\nMy wallpaper isn't stretching but\nI guess that's not the end of the world.\n\n1172\n01:00:26.580 --> 01:00:29.060\nBut I can come in here and I can see\nsome of the different applications and\n\n1173\n01:00:29.060 --> 01:00:30.200\nstuff that were installed.\n\n1174\n01:00:30.200 --> 01:00:35.810\nSo I've got like g edit and stuff, Firefox\nis installed as a web browser as default.\n\n1175\n01:00:35.810 --> 01:00:40.460\nAnd a few other things we can always\ndrop to a terminal and get to real work.\n\n1176\n01:00:40.460 --> 01:00:43.680\nBut otherwise,\nwe've got our basic system right here and\n\n1177\n01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:44.930\nit's ready to work with a GUI.\n\n1178\n01:00:44.930 --> 01:00:50.465\nA little bit more resource heavy to do\nthis, but it is easier to work with.\n\n1179\n01:00:53.704 --> 01:00:57.833\nAll right, a couple other things\nto tackle while we're in here,\n\n1180\n01:00:57.833 --> 01:01:00.690\nthe repos, the repositories.\n\n1181\n01:01:00.690 --> 01:01:05.060\nBy default, CentOS is pulling from the\nmain repository that has the tested and\n\n1182\n01:01:05.060 --> 01:01:05.960\nsafe packages.\n\n1183\n01:01:05.960 --> 01:01:08.490\nAnd that's where you normally\nwant to stay, all right but\n\n1184\n01:01:08.490 --> 01:01:10.740\nthere may be times when\nyou want to venture out.\n\n1185\n01:01:10.740 --> 01:01:12.470\nWhen you want to deviate and\n\n1186\n01:01:12.470 --> 01:01:15.490\npull in software that's not\nfrom the main repository.\n\n1187\n01:01:15.490 --> 01:01:20.547\nThe repositories themselves are controlled\n\n1188\n01:01:20.547 --> 01:01:25.867\nin a series of files that\nare located in it is in,\n\n1189\n01:01:25.867 --> 01:01:31.000\nslash etc.\n\n1190\n01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:34.274\nI thought it was repos.d and\napparently I am wrong.\n\n1191\n01:01:37.848 --> 01:01:40.490\nWell, there it is, sorry.\n\n1192\n01:01:40.490 --> 01:01:44.550\nIt's yum.repos.d, there we go.\n\n1193\n01:01:44.550 --> 01:01:51.110\nSo you have this folder,\nwhich is /etc/yum.repos.d and that's\n\n1194\n01:01:51.110 --> 01:01:55.190\nwhere it lists the repositories that it\nuses and so, you'll see cento s base.\n\n1195\n01:01:55.190 --> 01:01:57.170\nThat's the main one,\nthat's the one that's turned on and\n\n1196\n01:01:57.170 --> 01:01:58.660\nthe one that we normally use.\n\n1197\n01:01:58.660 --> 01:02:01.600\nThere's also a centos debug info,\ncentos media,\n\n1198\n01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:05.580\ncentos vault, those are a couple that\ncome in and they're disabled by default.\n\n1199\n01:02:05.580 --> 01:02:08.130\nAnd you can add your own if you want,\n\n1200\n01:02:08.130 --> 01:02:11.770\nif there's other software out there\nthat you want to grab and make use of.\n\n1201\n01:02:11.770 --> 01:02:14.830\nAnd you'll find where people\nreference that on the internet,\n\n1202\n01:02:14.830 --> 01:02:18.190\nI mentioned web admin,\nthat web based server management software.\n\n1203\n01:02:19.750 --> 01:02:24.550\nIf you go to their website,\nit's actually called WebMin,\n\n1204\n01:02:24.550 --> 01:02:27.070\nI think I said it wrong earlier,\nI think I said WebAdmin.\n\n1205\n01:02:27.070 --> 01:02:32.660\nBut if you go to their website, and\nyou pull up how to get it installed,\n\n1206\n01:02:32.660 --> 01:02:38.226\nright, so let's see if we want to do RPM.\n\n1207\n01:02:38.226 --> 01:02:42.980\nIt's going to have me\nactually download the RPM.\n\n1208\n01:02:42.980 --> 01:02:43.960\nSomewhere on here,\n\n1209\n01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:47.460\nthey actually have instructions to\ntie it to their own repository.\n\n1210\n01:02:47.460 --> 01:02:49.310\nThey have a repository set\nup you can point to and\n\n1211\n01:02:49.310 --> 01:02:52.040\nthe advantage of installing it\nthat way is, you can pull updates.\n\n1212\n01:02:52.040 --> 01:02:55.820\nWhen you run yum update,\nit'll check their repository\n\n1213\n01:02:55.820 --> 01:02:58.920\nto see if there's any updates and\npull them from there.\n\n1214\n01:02:58.920 --> 01:03:03.700\nSo let's see, minimal packages,\nlatest version links.\n\n1215\n01:03:03.700 --> 01:03:06.280\nWell, maybe they stopped\ndoing a repository or\n\n1216\n01:03:06.280 --> 01:03:09.730\nI'm just not seeing it or both.\n\n1217\n01:03:09.730 --> 01:03:13.930\nYeah, for the longest time\nthey had their own repository,\n\n1218\n01:03:13.930 --> 01:03:17.206\nlet's do a search here, Webmin repository.\n\n1219\n01:03:24.474 --> 01:03:25.755\nHere we go.\n>> Yeah.\n\n1220\n01:03:25.755 --> 01:03:28.441\n>> So, here they show just\ndownloading the RPM file and\n\n1221\n01:03:28.441 --> 01:03:30.773\nyou can install that\npackage just directly.\n\n1222\n01:03:30.773 --> 01:03:34.192\nBut a little bit below it,\nthey show a yum repository, so\n\n1223\n01:03:34.192 --> 01:03:38.763\nwe can create a .txt file that defines\nwhere their web based repository is.\n\n1224\n01:03:38.763 --> 01:03:42.345\nAnd you'll see it points to Webmin\nthere and once that's done and\n\n1225\n01:03:42.345 --> 01:03:45.748\nyou've attached to it and\nyou've got to download their key.\n\n1226\n01:03:45.748 --> 01:03:49.448\nTo make sure that you trust them and\nonce you've got it, you can just do.\n\n1227\n01:03:49.448 --> 01:03:52.808\nYum install webmin, or yum update webmin.\n\n1228\n01:03:52.808 --> 01:03:55.608\nSo you can add things like this,\nyou can add repositories.\n\n1229\n01:03:55.608 --> 01:03:56.642\nNow when you do that,\n\n1230\n01:03:56.642 --> 01:04:00.498\nyou're starting to move further away\nfrom where RedHat normally would be, and\n\n1231\n01:04:00.498 --> 01:04:04.690\nso being able to get support becomes\na little more challenging right.\n\n1232\n01:04:04.690 --> 01:04:08.880\nWith CentOS, we're already outside\nof support, but the more we deviate,\n\n1233\n01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:10.390\nthe more risk we open ourselves up to.\n\n1234\n01:04:10.390 --> 01:04:13.130\nSo make sure you only do this\nwith software that you trust.\n\n1235\n01:04:15.010 --> 01:04:17.310\nAll right so\nthose are our other repositories.\n\n1236\n01:04:17.310 --> 01:04:22.062\nI'll put a few other notes in the episode\nnotes just so that we have them.\n\n1237\n01:04:22.062 --> 01:04:27.030\nNow I've been talking about Yum so far,\nand Yum is typically the one that we want.\n\n1238\n01:04:27.030 --> 01:04:30.620\nIt's the one that most of us are gonna\nuse cuz Yum update just knocks it out,\n\n1239\n01:04:30.620 --> 01:04:32.540\ngets our server up to date, all right.\n\n1240\n01:04:32.540 --> 01:04:37.260\nBut the older RPM,\nthe Redhat Package Manager is still there.\n\n1241\n01:04:37.260 --> 01:04:41.404\nAnd we can use that to manage doing\nupdates and installing packages too.\n\n1242\n01:04:41.404 --> 01:04:43.563\nSo I want to talk a little bit about it,\nbut looking at the clock.\n\n1243\n01:04:43.563 --> 01:04:45.315\nWe're kinda right at our break time.\n\n1244\n01:04:45.315 --> 01:04:47.655\nSo let's stop here and take a break and\n\n1245\n01:04:47.655 --> 01:04:50.885\nwhen we get back we'll take a look at\nRPM then we'll wrap up from there.\n\n1246\n01:04:50.885 --> 01:04:51.725\n>> Sounds good.\n\n1247\n01:04:51.725 --> 01:04:53.561\n>> All right.\nSo stay tune, we will be back in a few.\n\n1248\n01:04:53.561 --> 01:04:57.437\n[SOUND] All right,\n\n1249\n01:04:57.437 --> 01:05:03.128\nwelcome back everybody.\n\n1250\n01:05:03.128 --> 01:05:07.001\nSo the last thing we're gonna take a look\nat here is the RPM package manager, or\n\n1251\n01:05:07.001 --> 01:05:08.481\nthe RedHat Package Manager.\n\n1252\n01:05:09.540 --> 01:05:12.640\nAnd it used to be a very\nimportant utility for us but\n\n1253\n01:05:12.640 --> 01:05:15.890\nlately it's really been\njust out shined by Yum.\n\n1254\n01:05:15.890 --> 01:05:17.820\nSo we almost always use Yum for\neverything.\n\n1255\n01:05:17.820 --> 01:05:21.570\nRPM is still good for offline package\nmanagement though, so if you've got\n\n1256\n01:05:21.570 --> 01:05:25.920\na server that's not connected to the\nInternet then you can still use the RPM.\n\n1257\n01:05:25.920 --> 01:05:29.372\nThe package manager to be able to install\nand update packages that you have.\n\n1258\n01:05:29.372 --> 01:05:32.490\nAll right, so\nlet's take a look at that on my machine.\n\n1259\n01:05:33.950 --> 01:05:37.160\nIf you just run RPM by itself,\nyou'll get the output,\n\n1260\n01:05:37.160 --> 01:05:38.170\nand boy, there's some-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1261\n01:05:38.170 --> 01:05:39.760\n>> Good output there.\n\n1262\n01:05:39.760 --> 01:05:44.810\nA ton of options involved in this cuz\nwe can use RPM to install packages,\n\n1263\n01:05:44.810 --> 01:05:48.660\nuninstall packages, and you can\nactually use it to build packages too.\n\n1264\n01:05:48.660 --> 01:05:52.370\nSo there's some interesting features\nthere, but for the most part,\n\n1265\n01:05:52.370 --> 01:05:57.520\nwe use it for offline servicing and\ninstalling new, or updated packages.\n\n1266\n01:05:57.520 --> 01:06:00.938\nSo, during the break I went ahead and\ninstalled a package, or\n\n1267\n01:06:00.938 --> 01:06:05.080\nI didn't install it, I downloaded\na package which my head is covering up,\n\n1268\n01:06:05.080 --> 01:06:07.630\nthere we go,\nwhich was that webmin utility.\n\n1269\n01:06:07.630 --> 01:06:10.320\nSo webmin is not in\nthe normal repositories and\n\n1270\n01:06:10.320 --> 01:06:14.380\nmaybe I don't want to add\nthe webmin repository to my system.\n\n1271\n01:06:14.380 --> 01:06:18.950\nSo I just download the RPM file,\nthe actual package file for that machine.\n\n1272\n01:06:18.950 --> 01:06:20.070\nOr for that software.\n\n1273\n01:06:20.070 --> 01:06:22.920\nWell, now I need to install it.\n\n1274\n01:06:22.920 --> 01:06:23.970\nWell, you can use Yum.\n\n1275\n01:06:23.970 --> 01:06:26.800\nYum actually has a local install\n\n1276\n01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:29.940\nmodifier that you can use to install\na local package if you want.\n\n1277\n01:06:29.940 --> 01:06:32.200\nSo we could use Yum, but\nI wanna show you guys RPM.\n\n1278\n01:06:32.200 --> 01:06:33.300\nSo we're gonna use that one.\n\n1279\n01:06:33.300 --> 01:06:37.110\nAll right now at its simplest,\nwe can say rpm-i and\n\n1280\n01:06:38.510 --> 01:06:42.440\nwhatever we want the package name to be or\nwhatever it actually is.\n\n1281\n01:06:42.440 --> 01:06:46.440\nSo webmin-1.698- whatever, all right?\n\n1282\n01:06:46.440 --> 01:06:52.005\nThat is the simplest version of that\ncommand you are installing this package.\n\n1283\n01:06:52.005 --> 01:06:55.615\nNow we can a little more to it and\nI really need to here.\n\n1284\n01:06:55.615 --> 01:06:57.740\nWebmin has a lot of dependencies,\n\n1285\n01:06:57.740 --> 01:07:00.400\nit depends on a lot of other\nsoftware to be present.\n\n1286\n01:07:00.400 --> 01:07:03.350\nAnd unfortunately it doesn't tell me that.\n\n1287\n01:07:03.350 --> 01:07:07.140\nSo, if I want to know why this things\ngonna fail to install I usually want\n\n1288\n01:07:07.140 --> 01:07:08.550\na little bit more information.\n\n1289\n01:07:08.550 --> 01:07:12.060\nSo when I do an install, I normally\ndon't just do i, I normally do ivh.\n\n1290\n01:07:13.340 --> 01:07:19.330\nAnd what ivh does is, i says to install,\nv says to give me verbose output,\n\n1291\n01:07:19.330 --> 01:07:22.500\nto actually show me detailed\ninformation as to what's going on.\n\n1292\n01:07:22.500 --> 01:07:25.830\nAnd then h says, give me hash marks.\n\n1293\n01:07:25.830 --> 01:07:29.160\nIf it's a large package,\nwhile it's installing it'll draw little\n\n1294\n01:07:29.160 --> 01:07:33.380\nhash marks on the screen to show that it's\ninstalling, kinda like a progress tracker.\n\n1295\n01:07:33.380 --> 01:07:34.080\nYou don't have to do that.\n\n1296\n01:07:34.080 --> 01:07:34.580\nBut I like it.\n>> Hm.\n\n1297\n01:07:34.580 --> 01:07:35.578\n>> It just lets me know what's going on.\n\n1298\n01:07:35.578 --> 01:07:36.849\nSo ivh is my,\n\n1299\n01:07:36.849 --> 01:07:42.860\nmy normal kind of go to on\nsomething like this, all right.\n\n1300\n01:07:42.860 --> 01:07:45.530\nSo I'm gonna tell it to\ninstall this package.\n\n1301\n01:07:45.530 --> 01:07:47.750\nAnd so\nI'm telling it where the package is.\n\n1302\n01:07:47.750 --> 01:07:48.480\nAnd it's going to grab it.\n\n1303\n01:07:48.480 --> 01:07:51.460\nAnd there you can see those hash marks\ngoing as it goes to install this.\n\n1304\n01:07:51.460 --> 01:07:55.980\nNow, when it installs,\nit's not doing dependency checking and so\n\n1305\n01:07:55.980 --> 01:07:58.040\nit's going to run into a situation here.\n\n1306\n01:07:58.040 --> 01:08:02.560\nFor example, if I want to run\na web-based management utility.\n\n1307\n01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:04.120\nI probably need a web server, don't I?\n\n1308\n01:08:04.120 --> 01:08:06.170\n>> Yeah.\n>> But I didn't install Apache when I\n\n1309\n01:08:06.170 --> 01:08:09.210\ninstalled this system or any of the other\nweb servers that are out there.\n\n1310\n01:08:09.210 --> 01:08:12.560\nSo when it's done,\nit's telling me to browse my own computer.\n\n1311\n01:08:12.560 --> 01:08:13.700\nLet me move this up.\n\n1312\n01:08:13.700 --> 01:08:15.980\nBrowse to My Computer on port 10,000.\n\n1313\n01:08:15.980 --> 01:08:21.162\nAnd I'll be able to log in with my root\npassword, which is also a great idea.\n\n1314\n01:08:21.162 --> 01:08:22.840\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] So the problem is\n\n1315\n01:08:22.840 --> 01:08:25.360\nI can't actually browse to My Computer\n\n1316\n01:08:25.360 --> 01:08:27.200\non port 10,000 because I'm\nnot running a web server.\n\n1317\n01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:29.750\nAnd so I'm not gonna get very far,\nall right?\n\n1318\n01:08:29.750 --> 01:08:33.040\nSo that's one of\nthe problems with using rpm.\n\n1319\n01:08:33.040 --> 01:08:34.080\nYou really need to know what you're doing.\n\n1320\n01:08:34.080 --> 01:08:36.100\nThat you've got the various\npackages that are involved and\n\n1321\n01:08:36.100 --> 01:08:37.940\nthat you're doing this offline servicing.\n\n1322\n01:08:37.940 --> 01:08:42.976\nSo we typically do this on really secure\nservers that are being strictly managed.\n\n1323\n01:08:42.976 --> 01:08:47.007\nSome of the other variations\nof that command so I and\n\n1324\n01:08:47.007 --> 01:08:53.778\nivh those are the most common, but some of\nthe other ones you might have like rpm-qa.\n\n1325\n01:08:53.778 --> 01:08:56.910\nAnyone that starts with -q is a quarry.\n\n1326\n01:08:56.910 --> 01:09:00.590\nSo we're quarrying packages and\na means all.\n\n1327\n01:09:00.590 --> 01:09:02.500\nWe're quarrying all the packages.\n\n1328\n01:09:02.500 --> 01:09:06.040\nSo give me a list of all the packages\nI've got installed right now.\n\n1329\n01:09:06.040 --> 01:09:06.790\nAnd so there it is.\n\n1330\n01:09:06.790 --> 01:09:10.840\nIt lays out all the packages that\nI've got in place, all right.\n\n1331\n01:09:10.840 --> 01:09:12.600\nIf we want to do\nan individual package though,\n\n1332\n01:09:12.600 --> 01:09:14.870\nbecause that went a little crazy, right?\n\n1333\n01:09:14.870 --> 01:09:18.580\nWe could just do- q and\nspecify a package, and\n\n1334\n01:09:18.580 --> 01:09:20.360\nI believe you have to do the full name for\nit.\n\n1335\n01:09:20.360 --> 01:09:21.750\nNo, nope, you can do it.\n\n1336\n01:09:21.750 --> 01:09:24.710\nSo I just did WebMin and so\nit found that one right there.\n\n1337\n01:09:24.710 --> 01:09:26.530\nwebmin- 1.690 whatever.\n\n1338\n01:09:26.530 --> 01:09:32.800\nThat's good for validating what version\nof a package you're running, all right.\n\n1339\n01:09:32.800 --> 01:09:36.100\nAnd you can do queries based\non an individual file.\n\n1340\n01:09:36.100 --> 01:09:39.350\nSo if you're browsing around\non your hard drive one day.\n\n1341\n01:09:39.350 --> 01:09:43.590\nAnd let's see,\nit wouldn't have created that.\n\n1342\n01:09:43.590 --> 01:09:44.470\nLets go here into webmin.\n\n1343\n01:09:44.470 --> 01:09:46.970\nAnd you're browsing around and\nyou come across a file and\n\n1344\n01:09:46.970 --> 01:09:51.110\nyou're like what made this\nminiserve.error file?\n\n1345\n01:09:51.110 --> 01:09:52.470\nI don't understand.\n\n1346\n01:09:52.470 --> 01:09:57.730\nWe can do rpm-qf,\nwhich is basically querying this file.\n\n1347\n01:09:57.730 --> 01:10:02.700\nAnd I can tell it to take a look at\nminiserve.error and it will look at it and\n\n1348\n01:10:02.700 --> 01:10:06.290\nshow what package was responsible for\ncreating that.\n\n1349\n01:10:06.290 --> 01:10:07.820\nAnd apparently, I picked a bad example,\n\n1350\n01:10:07.820 --> 01:10:10.390\ncuz it's saying it's not\nowned by any package.\n\n1351\n01:10:10.390 --> 01:10:13.560\nSo it must be a temporary file then.\n\n1352\n01:10:13.560 --> 01:10:15.650\nSo we could try something else,\n\n1353\n01:10:15.650 --> 01:10:19.790\nalthough I imagine it's gonna do the same\nthing on these other ones, isn't it?\n\n1354\n01:10:19.790 --> 01:10:22.190\nLet's try the PID file,\nthat's a process file.\n\n1355\n01:10:22.190 --> 01:10:25.370\nWell yeah, all right, so it's going\nto try the whole directory I suppose.\n\n1356\n01:10:28.650 --> 01:10:31.680\nAnd it found, all right, so\napparently it didn't register.\n\n1357\n01:10:31.680 --> 01:10:36.480\nThis comes down to whoever built this\npackage, so when the webmin guys built it\n\n1358\n01:10:36.480 --> 01:10:39.360\nthey just didn't put in that\nlisting to update the database, so\n\n1359\n01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:40.750\nit doesn't have a record of it.\n\n1360\n01:10:40.750 --> 01:10:43.060\nLet's pick something else,\nsomething that is in here.\n\n1361\n01:10:44.230 --> 01:10:47.901\nSo I'll take, well vimrc, right?\n\n1362\n01:10:47.901 --> 01:10:49.770\nI think I did that one in the Debian show.\n\n1363\n01:10:49.770 --> 01:10:57.670\nSo I could do rpm -qf /etc/ vimrc,\nall right?\n\n1364\n01:10:57.670 --> 01:11:02.050\nAnd it'll query that, and it'll show\nthat it belongs to vimcommon, and\n\n1365\n01:11:02.050 --> 01:11:04.940\nthat its current version is 7.2,\nblah, blah blah, right?\n\n1366\n01:11:04.940 --> 01:11:09.220\nSo we can query who it is that's\nresponsible for that file, all right.\n\n1367\n01:11:09.220 --> 01:11:11.150\nWhat other ones do I have here on my list?\n\n1368\n01:11:11.150 --> 01:11:14.420\nVerifying packages, all right.\n\n1369\n01:11:14.420 --> 01:11:17.360\nIt's possible that you installed\na package and when you installed it,\n\n1370\n01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:20.010\nthere's a lot of files\ninside of that package.\n\n1371\n01:11:20.010 --> 01:11:22.900\nAnd so when you installed it,\nall those files got copied out of there.\n\n1372\n01:11:22.900 --> 01:11:26.630\nWell, what if somebody went and\ndeleted one of those files?\n\n1373\n01:11:26.630 --> 01:11:29.750\nYou don't necessarily know that,\nthe package may have contained 100 files,\n\n1374\n01:11:29.750 --> 01:11:30.530\nnow there's 99 of them.\n\n1375\n01:11:30.530 --> 01:11:32.800\nHow do you know that one is missing?\n\n1376\n01:11:32.800 --> 01:11:35.653\nWell we have a nice little\nverification that we can run.\n\n1377\n01:11:35.653 --> 01:11:41.307\nYou can run rpm -Va.\n\n1378\n01:11:41.307 --> 01:11:45.136\nAnd that will validate or\nverify all of your packages and\n\n1379\n01:11:45.136 --> 01:11:47.588\nlook to see if anything is missing.\n\n1380\n01:11:47.588 --> 01:11:50.688\nAnd when you run that,\nit can be a lot, right?\n\n1381\n01:11:50.688 --> 01:11:53.568\nSo we usually shrink that down a bit.\n\n1382\n01:11:53.568 --> 01:11:55.768\nWe can say -Vp.\n\n1383\n01:11:55.768 --> 01:11:59.668\n>> And I can say let's go ahead and\nvalidate Vim.\n\n1384\n01:11:59.668 --> 01:12:00.640\nAll right.\n\n1385\n01:12:00.640 --> 01:12:01.790\nAnd, shoot.\n\n1386\n01:12:01.790 --> 01:12:03.580\nIt has to be in RPM that\nI've got sitting here.\n\n1387\n01:12:03.580 --> 01:12:04.930\nSo, I'll do WebMin.\n\n1388\n01:12:04.930 --> 01:12:08.758\nSo I'll do RPM dash Vp Webmin.\n\n1389\n01:12:08.758 --> 01:12:11.100\nThat one, all right.\n\n1390\n01:12:11.100 --> 01:12:13.030\nAnd so, it's gonna take a look at it and\n\n1391\n01:12:13.030 --> 01:12:15.155\nit's gonna be angry cuz I have no key,\nwonderful.\n\n1392\n01:12:15.155 --> 01:12:17.740\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But it's gonna validate it and look.\n\n1393\n01:12:17.740 --> 01:12:20.750\nAnd if there were any missing files,\nit would tell me.\n\n1394\n01:12:20.750 --> 01:12:23.230\nIt would give me a list of\nthe files that were missing.\n\n1395\n01:12:23.230 --> 01:12:24.120\nIn my case,\n\n1396\n01:12:24.120 --> 01:12:27.060\nthey just gave me a key warning\nbecause I haven't installed their key.\n\n1397\n01:12:27.060 --> 01:12:29.570\nBut otherwise,\nit didn't report any missing files.\n\n1398\n01:12:29.570 --> 01:12:30.900\nSo it looks like I'm in good shape.\n\n1399\n01:12:30.900 --> 01:12:31.690\nAll right.\n\n1400\n01:12:31.690 --> 01:12:33.830\nNow, what if I were to\nremove that package, right?\n\n1401\n01:12:33.830 --> 01:12:34.900\nIf I were to get rid of it.\n\n1402\n01:12:36.930 --> 01:12:38.506\nLet's see, what is that syntax?\n\n1403\n01:12:38.506 --> 01:12:41.635\nIt is Not yum.\n\n1404\n01:12:41.635 --> 01:12:42.996\nWell, I could use yum, I suppose.\n\n1405\n01:12:47.696 --> 01:12:49.235\nAnd get rid of it.\n\n1406\n01:12:49.235 --> 01:12:50.915\nSo, I'm deleting it with\na different command.\n\n1407\n01:12:50.915 --> 01:12:54.455\nI'm deleting it with yum,\nwhich is not happy about it.\n\n1408\n01:12:54.455 --> 01:12:57.290\nBut, so, I'm just gonna remove that\nout of there and get it out of place.\n\n1409\n01:12:57.290 --> 01:13:02.230\nAnd now, when I go and rerun that verify,\nso, I'm gonna verify this package.\n\n1410\n01:13:02.230 --> 01:13:05.470\nWhen I run it,\nlook at that giant list of missing files.\n\n1411\n01:13:05.470 --> 01:13:09.430\nSo, it just let me know that all these\nfiles should be there, and their missing.\n\n1412\n01:13:09.430 --> 01:13:12.610\nSo, great way to quickly test to make\nsure that the package is still intact,\n\n1413\n01:13:12.610 --> 01:13:14.462\nthat all the files\nare where they should be.\n\n1414\n01:13:17.010 --> 01:13:17.724\nAll right.\n\n1415\n01:13:17.724 --> 01:13:20.498\nAnd you can remove a package with RPM,\nalso.\n\n1416\n01:13:20.498 --> 01:13:24.298\nI just don't remember I\ndon't remember the syntax.\n\n1417\n01:13:24.298 --> 01:13:27.378\nIs it, gee.\n\n1418\n01:13:31.706 --> 01:13:33.670\nNo, it does not want to feed into that,\ndoes it?\n\n1419\n01:13:33.670 --> 01:13:36.950\n>> No.\n>> I wanna say it's dash r to remove.\n\n1420\n01:13:36.950 --> 01:13:42.790\nBut No, I guess it isn't.\n\n1421\n01:13:42.790 --> 01:13:44.324\nAll right.\nWell, there is a tag for it,\n\n1422\n01:13:44.324 --> 01:13:45.700\nI just don't seem to remember it.\n\n1423\n01:13:45.700 --> 01:13:48.820\nBut, basically,\nyou've got a suite of utilities here.\n\n1424\n01:13:48.820 --> 01:13:51.450\nJust my rule of thumb,\nif you're connected to the Internet,\n\n1425\n01:13:51.450 --> 01:13:54.040\nyou're using internet repositories,\nYum is the way to go.\n\n1426\n01:13:54.040 --> 01:13:56.640\nAlthough, it can be used for\nlocal stuff, too.\n\n1427\n01:13:56.640 --> 01:13:58.820\nRPM is great for offline servicing.\n\n1428\n01:13:58.820 --> 01:13:59.795\nWe can use it for installing.\n\n1429\n01:13:59.795 --> 01:14:03.660\nYum does dependency checking and\nis very robust.\n\n1430\n01:14:03.660 --> 01:14:08.592\nRPM doesn't do dependency checking and\nis very, very streamlined, you know?\n\n1431\n01:14:08.592 --> 01:14:10.920\nSo, Yum is gonna be our go to guy.\n\n1432\n01:14:10.920 --> 01:14:12.970\nThat's the one we're gonna\nwork with most of the time.\n\n1433\n01:14:12.970 --> 01:14:17.980\nYou'll fire up a new operating system,\nand you'll say yum-y update,\n\n1434\n01:14:17.980 --> 01:14:20.900\nthat says check for updates and\ngo ahead and apply them.\n\n1435\n01:14:20.900 --> 01:14:22.410\nJust go ahead and do it.\n\n1436\n01:14:22.410 --> 01:14:25.840\nAnd when you run that, it reaches out and\nit immediately starts to update.\n\n1437\n01:14:25.840 --> 01:14:27.130\nSo, here it goes and grabs.\n\n1438\n01:14:27.130 --> 01:14:29.970\nSo, if this is a brand new system,\nthere's no reason not to do this.\n\n1439\n01:14:29.970 --> 01:14:33.550\nNow, after this system is in production,\nit changes a little.\n\n1440\n01:14:33.550 --> 01:14:35.070\nThen, you run Yum update, and\n\n1441\n01:14:35.070 --> 01:14:37.970\nyou look through the list and you make\nsure everything's tested and okay.\n\n1442\n01:14:37.970 --> 01:14:39.740\nYou don't just blindly apply them.\n\n1443\n01:14:39.740 --> 01:14:41.777\nBut on a brand new install,\nwe oftentimes do.\n\n1444\n01:14:43.497 --> 01:14:46.170\nAll right.\n\n1445\n01:14:46.170 --> 01:14:48.210\nI think that's pretty much all I've got.\n\n1446\n01:14:48.210 --> 01:14:51.870\nThe only other thing I've\ngot is just like on Debian,\n\n1447\n01:14:51.870 --> 01:14:56.550\nwhen we install a package sent OS and\nredhat, they retain a copy\n\n1448\n01:14:56.550 --> 01:15:01.210\nof that package on the drive just in case\nwe need it for some reason or another.\n\n1449\n01:15:01.210 --> 01:15:06.852\nSo, if we need to get that cleaned up,\nif we're trying to recover space,\n\n1450\n01:15:06.852 --> 01:15:10.043\nthere is a clean operator that we can use.\n\n1451\n01:15:10.043 --> 01:15:15.910\nSo, you can say, it's Yum clean all,\nand that'll go ahead and remove that.\n\n1452\n01:15:15.910 --> 01:15:18.290\nIt's not one I use very often,\nI had to look at my notes.\n\n1453\n01:15:18.290 --> 01:15:21.540\nCuz hard drive space isn't\na problem like it used to be, so\n\n1454\n01:15:21.540 --> 01:15:23.040\nwe're not normally worried about it.\n\n1455\n01:15:23.040 --> 01:15:26.220\nBut if you're trying to clean that stuff\nup, you can run Yum Clean All, and\n\n1456\n01:15:26.220 --> 01:15:27.082\nit'll knock it out.\n\n1457\n01:15:27.082 --> 01:15:29.153\nThat's gonna take a little while to run,\nisn't it?\n\n1458\n01:15:34.345 --> 01:15:37.680\nWell, you know what I could do,\nI could, where's my GUI install?\n\n1459\n01:15:37.680 --> 01:15:38.390\nThis one.\n\n1460\n01:15:38.390 --> 01:15:39.700\nWe'll jump over here and do it.\n\n1461\n01:15:39.700 --> 01:15:42.580\nSo, here I am on this one,\nand I can say Yum Clean All.\n\n1462\n01:15:42.580 --> 01:15:43.620\nI'm not root.\n\n1463\n01:15:43.620 --> 01:15:44.770\nIt'll be mad about that, won't it?\n\n1464\n01:15:47.150 --> 01:15:48.800\nThere.\nYum Clean All.\n\n1465\n01:15:48.800 --> 01:15:50.130\nAnd what it's gonna do,\nit's gonna look for\n\n1466\n01:15:50.130 --> 01:15:53.310\nany leftover package files that we don't\nneed, and it's gonna clean them out.\n\n1467\n01:15:53.310 --> 01:15:55.360\nSo, see how it says\ncleaning up everything?\n\n1468\n01:15:55.360 --> 01:15:57.500\nJust knocking out anything we don't need.\n\n1469\n01:15:57.500 --> 01:16:02.770\nAnd that's pretty handy,\ncuz if I do Yum install vim,\n\n1470\n01:16:02.770 --> 01:16:05.760\nit's gonna go through and\ninstall vim and its dependencies.\n\n1471\n01:16:05.760 --> 01:16:09.160\nAnd then, if I uninstall it, sure,\nit removes the files from VIM, but\n\n1472\n01:16:09.160 --> 01:16:12.600\nit leaves the package file sitting there,\nso that's what it would remove.\n\n1473\n01:16:12.600 --> 01:16:17.756\nApparently, I all ready have VIM,\nso if I knock it out.\n\n1474\n01:16:20.518 --> 01:16:21.470\nThere we go.\n\n1475\n01:16:21.470 --> 01:16:23.730\nSo, I removed it, but\nthe package is still there.\n\n1476\n01:16:23.730 --> 01:16:27.090\nAnd it's not until I do Yum Clean All that\nit's gonna go through and wipe it out.\n\n1477\n01:16:27.090 --> 01:16:29.460\nAnd so, now,\nit's actually wiped out that package.\n\n1478\n01:16:29.460 --> 01:16:30.160\nAll right.\n\n1479\n01:16:30.160 --> 01:16:30.920\nThat's really about it.\n\n1480\n01:16:30.920 --> 01:16:32.030\nIt's pretty straightforward.\n\n1481\n01:16:32.030 --> 01:16:35.100\nThe commands are fairly intuitive,\nand you might have noticed\n\n1482\n01:16:35.100 --> 01:16:38.950\nthe commands between app get and\nyum are actually very similar.\n\n1483\n01:16:38.950 --> 01:16:40.050\n>> Right.\n>> And so, oftentimes,\n\n1484\n01:16:40.050 --> 01:16:43.150\nit's just a matter of swapping out\nAppGet for Yum and vice versa,\n\n1485\n01:16:43.150 --> 01:16:44.835\nand that'll knock it out.\n\n1486\n01:16:44.835 --> 01:16:50.760\nBut on the exam you may see some of\nthe fringe utilities like RPM and DPKG.\n\n1487\n01:16:50.760 --> 01:16:52.400\nOne other tool worth mentioning.\n\n1488\n01:16:52.400 --> 01:16:54.950\nThe packages themselves, the RPMs,\n\n1489\n01:16:54.950 --> 01:16:59.910\nthey're not just like zipped up files\nthat you can dearchive really easily.\n\n1490\n01:16:59.910 --> 01:17:02.800\nThe files themselves\nare compiled in a certain way.\n\n1491\n01:17:02.800 --> 01:17:06.690\nAnd so, if you need to extract\nindividual files from there,\n\n1492\n01:17:06.690 --> 01:17:10.490\nthere's another utility called rpm2cio.\n\n1493\n01:17:10.490 --> 01:17:15.646\nAnd what it does is it lets you\nconvert the RPM file into a CPIO\n\n1494\n01:17:15.646 --> 01:17:20.600\nfile which will let you copy and\nget content from inside of it.\n\n1495\n01:17:20.600 --> 01:17:23.040\nIt might show up on the exam, not always.\n\n1496\n01:17:23.040 --> 01:17:25.360\nBut RPM to CPIO.\n\n1497\n01:17:25.360 --> 01:17:27.600\nAnd basically, you point it at a package.\n\n1498\n01:17:27.600 --> 01:17:29.120\nI didn't.\nI was just trying to get the help file,\n\n1499\n01:17:29.120 --> 01:17:31.030\nwhich apparently it\ndoesn't want to bring up.\n\n1500\n01:17:31.030 --> 01:17:34.090\nBut you just point it to a package,\nand it'll do the conversion to it.\n\n1501\n01:17:34.090 --> 01:17:37.481\nThere's not much that you even\nprovide it with as far as input.\n\n1502\n01:17:41.878 --> 01:17:42.890\nThere we go.\n\n1503\n01:17:42.890 --> 01:17:46.100\nSo, there it's doing just the straight\nout dump of that information.\n\n1504\n01:17:46.100 --> 01:17:47.790\nI should have piped\nthat into another file.\n\n1505\n01:17:47.790 --> 01:17:50.530\nLet me do that.\n\n1506\n01:17:50.530 --> 01:17:56.220\nSo, I will pipe that into,\nI'll just call it webmn.cpio.\n\n1507\n01:17:56.220 --> 01:18:00.830\nAnd when you do that,\nnow you've got a CPIO file.\n\n1508\n01:18:00.830 --> 01:18:03.390\nYou'll see it's basically like D archive,\ndrpm.\n\n1509\n01:18:03.390 --> 01:18:08.800\nAnd now, I can reach into it and\ngrab content out of it as I need.\n\n1510\n01:18:08.800 --> 01:18:14.650\nRPM to CPIO Doesn't have\nmuch of a help file.\n\n1511\n01:18:14.650 --> 01:18:18.580\nYou'll see right there, you just specify\nthe package and that's about it.\n\n1512\n01:18:18.580 --> 01:18:21.700\nBut there are other utilities you\ncan use to reach in for CPIO.\n\n1513\n01:18:21.700 --> 01:18:23.980\nI don't think I have\nany of those installed.\n\n1514\n01:18:23.980 --> 01:18:24.970\nI do.\n\n1515\n01:18:24.970 --> 01:18:26.879\nSo, if we take a look at CPIO,\n\n1516\n01:18:26.879 --> 01:18:30.450\nyou'll see some of the different\nthings that it's got.\n\n1517\n01:18:30.450 --> 01:18:34.340\nBut you've got in there where\nyou can specify the file and\n\n1518\n01:18:34.340 --> 01:18:36.660\nwhat you're trying to\ngrab from inside of it.\n\n1519\n01:18:36.660 --> 01:18:38.870\nAnd it can reach inside of that and\npull out individual files.\n\n1520\n01:18:38.870 --> 01:18:42.798\nSo, if you ever need to extract just one\nfile from an rpm, there's utilities for\n\n1521\n01:18:42.798 --> 01:18:44.060\nthat, all right?\n\n1522\n01:18:44.060 --> 01:18:45.410\nNormally, you don't have to do that.\n\n1523\n01:18:45.410 --> 01:18:49.190\nIf you think something's damaged, you just\nreinstall the package, and off you go.\n\n1524\n01:18:49.190 --> 01:18:50.570\nSo, that's normally my approach, at least.\n\n1525\n01:18:52.250 --> 01:18:52.790\nAll right.\nWell,\n\n1526\n01:18:52.790 --> 01:18:54.770\nthat's probably a pretty good spot for\nus to wrap up.\n\n1527\n01:18:54.770 --> 01:18:57.250\nRonnie, can you think of anything\nelse we should throw out there?\n\n1528\n01:18:57.250 --> 01:18:58.100\n>> Nope, not really, yeah.\n\n1529\n01:18:58.100 --> 01:18:59.010\n>> All right.\n\n1530\n01:18:59.010 --> 01:19:01.850\nWell, like I said,\nI'm gonna post my little notes,\n\n1531\n01:19:01.850 --> 01:19:03.770\nthe various command that\nwe talked about today.\n\n1532\n01:19:03.770 --> 01:19:06.540\nSo, I'll post those with the videos so\nyou can see them.\n\n1533\n01:19:06.540 --> 01:19:09.980\nBut otherwise,\nthat's getting it installed now.\n\n1534\n01:19:09.980 --> 01:19:12.640\nFor the rest of this show,\nnot this episode, but\n\n1535\n01:19:12.640 --> 01:19:15.480\nthe entire show,\nwe're gonna be working in CentOS.\n\n1536\n01:19:15.480 --> 01:19:17.440\nSo, this is gonna be the distribution\nwe're gonna stay in for\n\n1537\n01:19:17.440 --> 01:19:18.900\nthe rest of Linux plus.\n\n1538\n01:19:18.900 --> 01:19:22.840\nAnd you'll find that, aside from those\nupdate utilities, pretty much everything\n\n1539\n01:19:22.840 --> 01:19:25.820\nelse is done identically between\nthe various distributions.\n\n1540\n01:19:25.820 --> 01:19:29.840\nAnd so, it really doesn't matter if you\nwant to continue on with Debian, you can.\n\n1541\n01:19:29.840 --> 01:19:31.770\nIf you want to switch over to CentOS,\nyou can.\n\n1542\n01:19:31.770 --> 01:19:32.500\nJust pick one.\n\n1543\n01:19:32.500 --> 01:19:34.200\nPick one that makes you happy.\n\n1544\n01:19:34.200 --> 01:19:35.440\nAnd stick with it.\n\n1545\n01:19:35.440 --> 01:19:37.940\nAnd really focus in on\nthe important commands,\n\n1546\n01:19:37.940 --> 01:19:39.930\nwhich are what we're gonna\nsee in the next episode.\n\n1547\n01:19:39.930 --> 01:19:41.460\n>> All right.\n>> All right.\n\n1548\n01:19:41.460 --> 01:19:45.680\nWell, let me just remind everybody that if\nyou have any questions on what we

The demonstrate the use of vi, the file editor that is found in just about every distro available. They show the power of vi to create a file, modify and save a file. They discuss the use of vi directly, on a consoled connection and a remote connection as well. They go through the basic commands that every Linux Admin needs to know when using a file editor.",

00:00:38.573\nAnd welcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:38.573 --> 00:00:41.751\nI'm your host, Don Pezet,\nback again with Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n5\n00:00:41.751 --> 00:00:42.450\nHow's it going Ronnie?\n\n6\n00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.580\n>> I am actually deeply\nsaddened this morning.\n\n7\n00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:48.140\nThe very fact there's\napparently Samuel L Jackson is\n\n8\n00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.035\ntoo busy to do the new Star Wars movie.\n\n9\n00:00:51.035 --> 00:00:53.275\nSo, according to the news\nthat I've just read.\n\n10\n00:00:53.275 --> 00:00:54.595\n>> Wow.\n>> So what a disappointment.\n\n11\n00:00:54.595 --> 00:00:56.405\n>> Well, he's probably saying,\n\n12\n00:00:56.405 --> 00:01:00.053\nI was in that other Star Wars movie,\nand fool me once shame on me.\n\n13\n00:01:00.053 --> 00:01:03.295\n[LAUGH] He's like I don't have time for\nbad movies.\n\n14\n00:01:03.295 --> 00:01:03.815\n>> Yeah.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n15\n00:01:03.815 --> 00:01:06.128\n>> I think he spends more time working\n\n16\n00:01:06.128 --> 00:01:07.240\non scripts.\n\n17\n00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:08.130\n>> Snakes on a Plane 2?\n\n18\n00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.013\n>> Snakes on a Plane 2.\n\n19\n00:01:09.013 --> 00:01:10.029\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n20\n00:01:10.029 --> 00:01:10.937\n>> The snakes are back.\n\n21\n00:01:10.937 --> 00:01:12.220\nIt's like Sharknado.\n\n22\n00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.519\n>> Yeah.\n>> [LAUGH] All right I got no segue for\n\n23\n00:01:14.519 --> 00:01:15.920\nthat one into Linux.\n\n24\n00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:16.450\nSo.\n\n25\n00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.018\n>> I tried, I said working on scripts.\n\n26\n00:01:20.018 --> 00:01:20.590\n>> Yeah.\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n27\n00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:21.148\n>> I tried.\n\n28\n00:01:21.148 --> 00:01:21.682\n>> Yeah.\n\n29\n00:01:21.682 --> 00:01:23.145\n[LAUGH]\n>> Well, all right, whatever.\n\n30\n00:01:23.145 --> 00:01:27.950\n[LAUGH] So welcome back to\nanother episode of Linux plus.\n\n31\n00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.030\nIn our first two episodes,\n\n32\n00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.000\nwe got a chance to see installing two of\nthe most common distributions out there.\n\n33\n00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.050\nWe saw Debian and we saw CentOS.\n\n34\n00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:42.140\nToday we're gonna flip over into\ndistro agnostic mode, okay.\n\n35\n00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.330\nIn fact we're gonna flip over in operating\nsystem agnostic mode in a large case.\n\n36\n00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.070\nWhat we're gonna do is we're\ngonna take a look at the command\n\n37\n00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.510\nline interface that we\nnormally use inside of Linux.\n\n38\n00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:56.170\nNow the command line interface that Linux\nuses, it can vary, because there's so\n\n39\n00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.370\nmany different shells you can pick from.\n\n40\n00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:03.560\nBut all of them conform to a certain\nset of standards that make them\n\n41\n00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:04.620\nUnix compatible.\n\n42\n00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:07.780\nRemember, all this stuff\nkinda originated from\n\n43\n00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.400\npeople wanting to create a freely\navailable version of Unix.\n\n44\n00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.270\nSo the cool thing here is we're gonna see\ncommands today that are just your go to\n\n45\n00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:19.130\ncommands for operating, and\nmoving around the command line interface.\n\n46\n00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:23.180\nAnd you'll find that they work in\npractically every Linux distribution.\n\n47\n00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.650\nThey work in practically\nevery BSD distribution.\n\n48\n00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:32.050\nThey work in Unix, and they even work in\nother OSs that just chose to emulate this.\n\n49\n00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:35.550\nYou'll see a lot of these commands\nwork on like Cisco routers that aren't\n\n50\n00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:36.680\nbased on any of those.\n\n51\n00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.860\nSo these are commands that\nare very good to know, very good\n\n52\n00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.540\nthings to have committed to memory, and\nwhen you learn them they work darn near\n\n53\n00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.615\neverywhere with the exception of Windows,\nmost of them don't work in Windows.\n\n54\n00:02:48.615 --> 00:02:53.650\n[LAUGH] So You know, unless you install\none of those tool kits on there.\n\n55\n00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.070\nBut, for the most part, these are going\nto work throughout the star nix world,\n\n56\n00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:02.230\nwhere they do the *nix to say UNIX,\nLINUX, whatever.\n\n57\n00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:02.794\nThat it'll work.\nSo\n\n58\n00:03:02.794 --> 00:03:07.171\nworking with the command line is perhaps\none of the most intimidating parts of\n\n59\n00:03:07.171 --> 00:03:08.190\nlearning Linux.\n\n60\n00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:14.640\nAnd so what I've done if you look at\nthe exam objectives for the Linux + exams.\n\n61\n00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.442\nThey had this giant laundry\nlist of commands, and\n\n62\n00:03:17.442 --> 00:03:21.640\nthey're all just kinda lumped together and\nit is intimidating.\n\n63\n00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.120\nSo what I wanted to do is put\ntogether a special show, this show.\n\n64\n00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.950\nWhere we talk about the commands that\nyou should know by heart just for\n\n65\n00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:31.340\nnormal functioning.\n\n66\n00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.770\nThis would make life a lot easier.\n\n67\n00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:38.000\nBecause in episode number ten I can\nguarantee you we're going to edit a file.\n\n68\n00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.550\nI have no idea what episode\nten is going to be, but\n\n69\n00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:41.020\nI can guarantee you we're\ngoing to edit a file.\n\n70\n00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:42.700\nAnd we're going to use\nthe Vi editor to do that.\n\n71\n00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:47.030\nAnd if you've never used it before,\nman it is not intuitive at all.\n\n72\n00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:51.090\nSo having that under your belt,\nunderstanding the basics of the commands\n\n73\n00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.010\nwill make learning other\nthings a lot easier.\n\n74\n00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:56.020\nSo this is really important,\n\n75\n00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:58.840\nprobably the most important of\nthe shows that we're gonna film.\n\n76\n00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.390\nBecause if If your just getting\nstarted out, this is data,\n\n77\n00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:04.750\nthis is knowledge that you\nshould have in your brain.\n\n78\n00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.637\n>> Yeah, if you go back and remember\nsaying the very intro show that we had,\n\n79\n00:04:08.637 --> 00:04:12.206\nwe saw were the percentage was\njust like 43 or 46% of the exam,\n\n80\n00:04:12.206 --> 00:04:13.696\nis all on the command line.\n\n81\n00:04:13.696 --> 00:04:15.557\nSo they expect you to actually know, and\n\n82\n00:04:15.557 --> 00:04:18.200\nhaving the basic knowledge\nwe're gonna show you today.\n\n83\n00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:21.750\nWe're gonna learn more as we go throughout\nthe show, but having this fundamental\n\n84\n00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.910\nknowledge here is gonna help you actually\nlearn easier and do more things.\n\n85\n00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:26.920\nSo make sure we do pay attention here.\n\n86\n00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:27.940\n>> Yep.\n\n87\n00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:30.760\nAll right, so\nlet's go ahead and take a look.\n\n88\n00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.804\nI've got my CentOS machine that\nwe brought up in the last show.\n\n89\n00:04:33.804 --> 00:04:36.874\nAnd what I'm gonna do is just kind of\nwalk through some of the different\n\n90\n00:04:36.874 --> 00:04:40.430\nthings that we deal with with\nthe command line interface, all right.\n\n91\n00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:44.740\nNow the first thing you'll notice is\nI booted this machine up and I got my\n\n92\n00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:49.690\nlogin name right here and my password,\nwhich is fortunately not displayed\n\n93\n00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:53.200\non screen although then you'd know it\nwas the word dpezet in all lower case.\n\n94\n00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:56.460\n[LAUGH] So anyhow,\nyou can see my username and password.\n\n95\n00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:58.275\nAnd then it dropped me to a prompt.\n\n96\n00:04:58.275 --> 00:05:00.960\nBut apparently I pressed enter twice\nbecause I have two prompts here.\n\n97\n00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:05.330\nSo what we're seeing on the left\nhere is called the command prompt.\n\n98\n00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:07.430\nAnd then immediately\nfollowing it is a cursor.\n\n99\n00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:09.630\nAnd the cursor indicates\nthat if I start typing,\n\n100\n00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:12.830\nthat's where the letters\nare going to appear, okay?\n\n101\n00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:17.620\nSo what we see on the screen is\nreally the command line interface,\n\n102\n00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:20.400\nit's waiting for\nme to tell the computer to do something.\n\n103\n00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.570\nOtherwise, it's just\nsitting there waiting.\n\n104\n00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:25.650\n>> Okay, now that prompt is\nmade up of a couple of pieces.\n\n105\n00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:32.720\nThe first piece is my username and then\nan @ symbol and the computer that I'm on.\n\n106\n00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.640\nNow I just called this computer localhost.\n\n107\n00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:35.930\nThat was the default on the install.\n\n108\n00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:38.160\nI just hit next a bunch..\n\n109\n00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:42.710\nSo normally as would say\ndpezet at DP-CentOS, or\n\n110\n00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:44.770\nwhatever it is that we've\nnamed the computer.\n\n111\n00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:47.050\nThis one's just named local host,\nall right.\n\n112\n00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:49.050\nThe next part is the path.\n\n113\n00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:56.270\nI'm logged in, and I am accessing files,\nfolders, whatever on the hard drive.\n\n114\n00:05:56.270 --> 00:06:01.190\nLinux likes to represent everything\nin terms of files, be it hardware or\n\n115\n00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:03.270\nwhatever, almost everything's\nrepresented as files.\n\n116\n00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:05.200\nNot everything though, like RAM isn't.\n\n117\n00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:08.340\nYou get some of those fringe\noperating systems like Plan 9,\n\n118\n00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:11.310\neverything is represented\nas a file even memory.\n\n119\n00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:15.030\nBut on this one just most stuff is a file.\n\n120\n00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:19.700\nSo that little tilde right there,\nthat squiggly line, it's called a tilde,\n\n121\n00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:24.010\nthat tells me that I am\nin my home directory.\n\n122\n00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:27.730\nThe directory for dpzet,\nfrom my user account, alright?\n\n123\n00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:29.920\nYour home is represented by that shortcut.\n\n124\n00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:34.360\nNow, that's not the actual directory path.\n\n125\n00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:38.320\nIf we wanna see that, well, we have a\nsimple little command, what we'll look at\n\n126\n00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:41.770\nin a minute, that'll show us what\npath we're actually in, all right.\n\n127\n00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:43.850\nBut that's what the command\nprompt is made up of.\n\n128\n00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:46.620\nYour user name, your machine name, and\n\n129\n00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:50.370\nwhat folder you're in currently,\nall right.\n\n130\n00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:53.340\nThen, it's follow,\nyou'll see that's in square brackets,\n\n131\n00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:57.080\nthen it's followed by a character,\nand I see a little dollar sign, right?\n\n132\n00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:02.070\nThat dollar sign means that I'm logged\nin as a regular user, all right?\n\n133\n00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:06.280\nI'm not a high privileged\nadministrative account on this system.\n\n134\n00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:09.780\nI'm just a regular user, all right.\n\n135\n00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:12.360\nIf you login as a high privileged user.\n\n136\n00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:14.250\nWhat we typically call root, right?\n\n137\n00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:17.440\nWe saw in the install episode that there's\na default account called root that's\n\n138\n00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:19.850\ncreated when the system is installed.\n\n139\n00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:24.320\nAnd if I were to log in as root, so\nI'm gonna log in as the root account.\n\n140\n00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:28.180\nNotice that the prompt\nis root@localhost until,\n\n141\n00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:33.860\nthat's all the same, but now I've got\na hash mark or a pound symbol, right?\n\n142\n00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:37.440\nThat tells me that I am a privileged user.\n\n143\n00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:39.010\nI am a administrator.\n\n144\n00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:41.450\nI am the root user on this system.\n\n145\n00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:45.123\nWhen you see that, that means you\ncould really cause some damage,\n\n146\n00:07:45.123 --> 00:07:47.681\nthat you got permission\nto do all sorts of crazy\n\n147\n00:07:47.681 --> 00:07:50.841\nthings that could really mess\nup the system, all right.\n\n148\n00:07:50.841 --> 00:07:55.691\nSo, for example, I could type reboot\nright now and the system would reboot,\n\n149\n00:07:55.691 --> 00:07:58.015\nit would just go offline and reboot.\n\n150\n00:07:58.015 --> 00:08:02.457\nVersus if I was logged in as my\nregular user, and I run something.\n\n151\n00:08:02.457 --> 00:08:06.989\nActually, I don't remember if I set this\none up so regular users can reboot or not.\n\n152\n00:08:06.989 --> 00:08:08.452\nCuz a user can, well,\n\n153\n00:08:08.452 --> 00:08:14.385\nI could try something a little bit crazier\nlike I could try and apply updates, right?\n\n154\n00:08:14.385 --> 00:08:18.145\nSo if I did yum update, like that,\n\n155\n00:08:18.145 --> 00:08:21.725\nit'll look out to the system and you\nneed to be root to perform this command.\n\n156\n00:08:21.725 --> 00:08:22.885\nI'm a regular user.\n\n157\n00:08:22.885 --> 00:08:23.855\nI'm not allowed to do that.\n\n158\n00:08:23.855 --> 00:08:24.955\nI can't update the system.\n\n159\n00:08:26.010 --> 00:08:27.650\nSo pros and cons with this.\n\n160\n00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:31.740\nThe pro side, I'm using a non-privileged\nuser, that means I can't really damage\n\n161\n00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:34.940\nthe system, I can't do anything that would\naffect the system from booting up and\n\n162\n00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:37.310\nthis is what we normally\nwant to log in as.\n\n163\n00:08:37.310 --> 00:08:40.450\nOnly when we want to do administrative\ntasks, will we log in as root and\n\n164\n00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:41.860\nthere's even ways to get around that.\n\n165\n00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:44.750\nSo we'll see that when we get to\nthe security episode, how to handle that.\n\n166\n00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:47.740\nAll right, but that's what that\nsymbol means, right there.\n\n167\n00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:51.521\nIf you see a pound symbol, that means\nyou've got administrative access,\n\n168\n00:08:51.521 --> 00:08:52.880\nthat you are root.\n\n169\n00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:57.096\nAnd if you've got a dollar sign,\nthat means that you're a regular user,\n\n170\n00:08:57.096 --> 00:08:57.781\nall right?\n\n171\n00:08:57.781 --> 00:09:02.318\nSo that prompt is basically giving us some\nnice little information about our system.\n\n172\n00:09:02.318 --> 00:09:06.228\nNow, the prompt is customizable, and\nyou'll see some distributions out there\n\n173\n00:09:06.228 --> 00:09:09.058\nwill modify the default prompt\nto show different things.\n\n174\n00:09:09.058 --> 00:09:14.017\nIn fact, some might not modify it at all,\nand the default for this prompt on\n\n175\n00:09:14.017 --> 00:09:19.580\nsome systems is just to display the path\nand then that symbol, and that's it.\n\n176\n00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:22.180\nSo, you may not see all of\nthis information in the path,\n\n177\n00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:25.480\ndepending on which distribution you use,\nand which shell you use.\n\n178\n00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:28.099\nCuz there may be more\nthan one shell on there.\n\n179\n00:09:28.099 --> 00:09:32.924\n[LAUGH] So, for those of you watching\nrecorded or in the chat room,\n\n180\n00:09:32.924 --> 00:09:35.668\nMikael just recommended a command.\n\n181\n00:09:35.668 --> 00:09:40.308\n[LAUGH] That, if I were to run as\na regular user, it's perfectly fine.\n\n182\n00:09:40.308 --> 00:09:42.942\nBut if I were to run as an administrative\nuser, it would erase my hard drive.\n\n183\n00:09:42.942 --> 00:09:45.781\n[LAUGH] So that's the kind\nof thing as a regular user,\n\n184\n00:09:45.781 --> 00:09:48.980\nI don't have to worry\nabout breaking the system.\n\n185\n00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:51.720\nI could break my own user account,\nI suppose.\n\n186\n00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:55.060\nBut I wouldn't have to worry about\nbreaking the rest of the system.\n\n187\n00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:58.700\nAll right, so what are some of the other\ncommands that we might want to do?\n\n188\n00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:01.720\nWell, once we're in here,\njust a few simple things,\n\n189\n00:10:02.950 --> 00:10:07.340\npressing Enter, that's me pressing Enter\nright there just to create new lines.\n\n190\n00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:11.570\nI do that sometimes just\nto kinda clear things up.\n\n191\n00:10:11.570 --> 00:10:14.520\nThe more you type, the more you do,\nthe screen gets a little cluttered, and\n\n192\n00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:18.480\nsometimes I'll just tap enter\na few times to get to a new line.\n\n193\n00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:20.840\nThere's also a command called clear.\n\n194\n00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:24.020\nAnd if you type clear,\nit just erases your screen, and\n\n195\n00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:25.930\nputs you back to a regular\nprompt like that.\n\n196\n00:10:25.930 --> 00:10:30.130\nSo again, if you got a lot of junk\non your screen, or you did something\n\n197\n00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:32.845\nthat made sensitive information come up\non the screen and you want to get it out\n\n198\n00:10:32.845 --> 00:10:36.575\nof there real quick, clear is a nice\ncommand to use just to reset that.\n\n199\n00:10:36.575 --> 00:10:39.465\nI bring it up here, not cuz that's an\nimportant command, we don't need it, but\n\n200\n00:10:39.465 --> 00:10:42.270\nI'm gonna use it throughout the show,\njust to make sure that I've got a nice,\n\n201\n00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:44.169\nclean screen as I show you\nguys some of the commands.\n\n202\n00:10:44.169 --> 00:10:48.743\nSo you'll see me type clear from\ntime to time just to do that.\n\n203\n00:10:48.743 --> 00:10:49.430\nAll right,\n\n204\n00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:54.085\nthere's also the exit command which I\nalready used without thinking about it.\n\n205\n00:10:54.085 --> 00:10:56.920\nThe exit command says basically log out.\n\n206\n00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:58.620\nRight, log out as this user,\n\n207\n00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:02.300\nand exit actually is just kinda logging\nyou out of this particular window.\n\n208\n00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:05.500\nIf you had more than one open,\nit wouldn't actually log you out.\n\n209\n00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:09.600\nSo you will see,\nsome systems will have the logoff alias,\n\n210\n00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:13.610\nand this one doesn't, or\nthe logout alias, there we go.\n\n211\n00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:16.410\nAnd so, you'll see log off, log out, but\n\n212\n00:11:16.410 --> 00:11:18.750\nthey almost always map\nto the exit command.\n\n213\n00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:21.160\nAnd so\nyou can just run exit to get logged out.\n\n214\n00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:24.760\nAnd then you go and log right back in\nagain, if that's what you want to do.\n\n215\n00:11:26.822 --> 00:11:31.030\nAll right, so those are a couple\nof things to think about.\n\n216\n00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:34.320\nA couple of different commands that we've\ngot available, just for getting in and\n\n217\n00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:34.960\nout of the system.\n\n218\n00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:39.470\nNow, let's talk about paths.\n\n219\n00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:42.450\nI mentioned that our home directory,\nit's a directory,\n\n220\n00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:46.140\nit's a folder on the hard drive somewhere\nthat is just for your user account.\n\n221\n00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:51.715\nAnd we can't really see that here because\nit displays our home directory as that ~.\n\n222\n00:11:51.715 --> 00:11:54.925\nSo a useful command to type in is pwd,\n\n223\n00:11:54.925 --> 00:11:59.445\nand that is the print working\ndirectory command, right?\n\n224\n00:12:00.505 --> 00:12:06.480\nYou'll notice that a lot of Unix and GNU\nutilities, they work with abbreviations.\n\n225\n00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:10.600\nSo something might be a very long thing,\nlike printworkingdirectory,\n\n226\n00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:12.930\nand it just abbreviates it down to pwd.\n\n227\n00:12:12.930 --> 00:12:17.220\nEven if it's a short word, like copy,\nit'll abbreviate that down to cp.\n\n228\n00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:19.490\nSo you'll see a very common pattern there,\n\n229\n00:12:19.490 --> 00:12:24.590\nthey usually just remove the vowels,\nand leave the consonants behind.\n\n230\n00:12:24.590 --> 00:12:28.680\nBut if you type pwd,\nit'll show you what folder you're in.\n\n231\n00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:31.980\nAnd i can see that I'm in /home/dpczet.\n\n232\n00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:35.680\nThat's my user folder, and\nthat's where I'm at right now.\n\n233\n00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:40.200\nOkay, so, on the hard drive, this is\nthe folder that I'm currently working in.\n\n234\n00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:43.260\nIf I execute commands,\nif I create a file or whatever.\n\n235\n00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:47.450\nIt's doing it from the perspective\nof this folder right here.\n\n236\n00:12:47.450 --> 00:12:51.300\nBut there's plenty of other folders that\nare out there on the hard drive that I may\n\n237\n00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:56.060\nneed to move between and\nwe'll see that here in a minute.\n\n238\n00:12:56.060 --> 00:12:59.660\nCouple other things to note,\nif you're coming from the Windows world,\n\n239\n00:12:59.660 --> 00:13:04.850\nnotice how that path is\nwritten /home/dpezet, okay?\n\n240\n00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:08.220\nIn the Windows world, those slashes\npoint the other direction, right,\n\n241\n00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:09.620\nthey're backslashes.\n\n242\n00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:12.840\nIn the Unix world,\nthey're forward slashes.\n\n243\n00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:17.030\nAnd so a better way to put it would be,\nin the Windows world, they're backslashes.\n\n244\n00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:19.510\nIn everything else,\nthey're forward slashes.\n\n245\n00:13:19.510 --> 00:13:21.610\nSo if you look at this and\nthink, man that's weird.\n\n246\n00:13:21.610 --> 00:13:23.140\nWhy don't they do it the Windows way?\n\n247\n00:13:23.140 --> 00:13:26.410\nThe better question is,\nwhy did Microsoft go the other way?\n\n248\n00:13:26.410 --> 00:13:27.200\nThey're the only ones.\n\n249\n00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:29.260\nEverybody else uses forward slashes.\n\n250\n00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:32.025\nSo you do need to get used to that.\n\n251\n00:13:32.025 --> 00:13:32.550\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n252\n00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:35.061\n>> The other thing is you'll notice\nthere's no drive letter, right?\n\n253\n00:13:35.061 --> 00:13:41.632\nSo in Windows, I might see something\nlike C:\\home\\dpezet, like that, right?\n\n254\n00:13:41.632 --> 00:13:44.070\nC: identifying the hard drive.\n\n255\n00:13:44.070 --> 00:13:46.960\nWell in Linux,\nwe don't have drive letters.\n\n256\n00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:50.420\nYou just have paths, right,\nthat you can mount things to.\n\n257\n00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:52.930\nWhen we did the install,\nremember I mentioned how\n\n258\n00:13:52.930 --> 00:13:57.220\nwe could mount /home to a different hard\ndrive or different partition if we wanted.\n\n259\n00:13:57.220 --> 00:13:59.710\nSo it's just mounting those\ndrives to a different folder.\n\n260\n00:13:59.710 --> 00:14:02.470\nAnd you can do that in Windows too but\nthe default is they don't.\n\n261\n00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:05.310\nSo they have drive letters,\nin Linux we don't.\n\n262\n00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:08.010\nSo in the Linux world, it's actually\na little easier cuz you just have to\n\n263\n00:14:08.010 --> 00:14:11.780\nremember the path, there's no figuring\nout drive letters involved, all right?\n\n264\n00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:15.590\nSo that folder structure,\nit starts with slash.\n\n265\n00:14:15.590 --> 00:14:18.050\nSlash is called the root of the system,\n\n266\n00:14:18.050 --> 00:14:21.200\nnot to be confused with\nthe root user account, right?\n\n267\n00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:23.320\nThe root user is that super user.\n\n268\n00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:28.150\nBut the root folder, that's just the base\nof our file structure, all right?\n\n269\n00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:30.950\nAnd it may or may not correspond\nto an actual hard drive.\n\n270\n00:14:30.950 --> 00:14:35.870\nIt typically does, but it could just be\na virtual that then has subfolders that\n\n271\n00:14:35.870 --> 00:14:38.710\nactually point to real hard drives.\n\n272\n00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:44.257\nIn that slash folder is where we have\nthe rest of our system referenced.\n\n273\n00:14:44.257 --> 00:14:49.108\nAnd so, for example, I have /home and\nthat's where my user account folders are.\n\n274\n00:14:49.108 --> 00:14:51.483\nSo every user has their\nown home directory and\n\n275\n00:14:51.483 --> 00:14:54.600\nthat's where they reside on this system,\nright?\n\n276\n00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:57.620\nOther operating systems may choose to move\nit, and you can move it too, if you want.\n\n277\n00:14:57.620 --> 00:14:59.360\nYou can override it when\nyou create user accounts,\n\n278\n00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:00.950\nthere's a lot of flexibility there.\n\n279\n00:15:00.950 --> 00:15:05.716\nBut the default is under /home, we're\ncreating another folder which is slash and\n\n280\n00:15:05.716 --> 00:15:09.400\nthen whatever our user account is,\nall right?\n\n281\n00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:10.800\nNow, inside of that folder,\n\n282\n00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:13.834\nwe can then have all sorts of other\nfolders if we want to, right?\n\n283\n00:15:13.834 --> 00:15:20.100\nWe can start to create our own folders and\nset up our own structure as need be.\n\n284\n00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:23.440\nSo, right now,\nI know I'm in my home folder,\n\n285\n00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:26.940\nmaybe I wanna have a folder for\nmy documents.\n\n286\n00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:29.840\nI wanna have a folder for my music,\n\n287\n00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:34.650\nvideos, I might wanna have various folders\nfor categorizing all of my files, okay?\n\n288\n00:15:35.970 --> 00:15:38.231\nWell, a lot of Linux distributions\nwill create those for you,\n\n289\n00:15:38.231 --> 00:15:40.430\nI did a minimal install so\nit probably didn't.\n\n290\n00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:42.811\nSo, I need to see what's in here,\nall right?\n\n291\n00:15:42.811 --> 00:15:45.709\nAnd so, now we're gonna take\na look at what's probably the most\n\n292\n00:15:45.709 --> 00:15:47.436\ncommonly run command for me, right?\n\n293\n00:15:47.436 --> 00:15:49.210\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> The one that I run all the time,\n\n294\n00:15:49.210 --> 00:15:51.690\nwhich is the directory list command.\n\n295\n00:15:51.690 --> 00:15:54.253\nI wanna see what's in this directory.\n\n296\n00:15:54.253 --> 00:15:57.150\nAnd the command to do that is ls.\n\n297\n00:15:57.150 --> 00:16:00.772\nAgain, if you're coming from the Windows\nworld, it's dir, directory, but\n\n298\n00:16:00.772 --> 00:16:03.651\nin Pretty much everything else,\nit's ls, the list command.\n\n299\n00:16:03.651 --> 00:16:08.140\nAnd when you run ls it will\nshow you what's in that folder.\n\n300\n00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:11.270\nAnd I can see nothing,\nI don't have anything, right?\n\n301\n00:16:11.270 --> 00:16:14.480\nWell, not necessarily true.\n\n302\n00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:18.580\nThere could be some hidden files in here,\nand then I'm not seeing those.\n\n303\n00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:21.910\nAnd in fact, it's almost a guarantee that\nthere's at least one hidden file in there.\n\n304\n00:16:21.910 --> 00:16:27.060\nSo like most commands,\nls will accept command line modifiers,\n\n305\n00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:31.148\nlittle flags that we could attach to the\ncommand to change the way that it behaves.\n\n306\n00:16:31.148 --> 00:16:35.920\nThe default behavior of running ls is to\nget me a list of the files in this folder,\n\n307\n00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:39.620\nand then to give me,\nwell that's really about it, right?\n\n308\n00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:40.860\n>> Yeah.\n>> Just give me the list of the files,\n\n309\n00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:43.760\nthe names of the files,\nand hide the hidden ones.\n\n310\n00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:46.180\nBut I might want it to\nshow the hidden ones too.\n\n311\n00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:49.880\nAnd so I can say, ls -a, okay?\n\n312\n00:16:50.910 --> 00:16:54.790\nThe dash tells it that I'm about to\ngive it a command line modifier.\n\n313\n00:16:54.790 --> 00:17:00.618\nAnd the a tells it I want it to show all\nfiles, including the hidden ones, okay?\n\n314\n00:17:00.618 --> 00:17:05.700\nSo ls -a, when I run that I see\nsomething different, right?\n\n315\n00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:08.070\nI can see that there's four files in here,\nright?\n\n316\n00:17:08.070 --> 00:17:11.730\nThere's actually six, but\non the screen we really only see four.\n\n317\n00:17:11.730 --> 00:17:16.350\nSo we see a bash_history, bash_logout,\nbash_profile, and bashrc.\n\n318\n00:17:16.350 --> 00:17:17.990\nWell, what are all those?\n\n319\n00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:21.760\nWell, the shell that I'm actually using,\nthe program that's representing this\n\n320\n00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:24.060\ncommand line interface,\nis a shell called bash.\n\n321\n00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:26.800\nAnd there's several different\nones that are out there.\n\n322\n00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:29.860\nBash is just the basic shell\nthat most systems use.\n\n323\n00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:32.770\nThere's a shell just called sh,\nthat's the original shell.\n\n324\n00:17:32.770 --> 00:17:34.610\nIt's very, very basic.\n\n325\n00:17:34.610 --> 00:17:40.800\nYou have tcsh, and csh, zsh, all these\ndifferent shells that are out there.\n\n326\n00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:43.740\nThe commands are pretty much the same\nregardless of which shell you use.\n\n327\n00:17:43.740 --> 00:17:46.140\nWhat's different is just kinda\nhow things look on screen.\n\n328\n00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:47.750\nSome of them do nice little colors and\n\n329\n00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:51.880\nall sorts of stuff,\njust depends on which one you're using.\n\n330\n00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:56.080\nSo with bash, what I'm using,\nit has configuration files.\n\n331\n00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:59.500\nAnd configuration files store information\nabout how that shell's configured, and so\n\n332\n00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:01.672\nthat's what these are,\nthat's what these four files are.\n\n333\n00:18:01.672 --> 00:18:04.545\nThe bash_history is the history\nof commands that I've run.\n\n334\n00:18:04.545 --> 00:18:08.550\nBash_logout is what to run when I log out.\n\n335\n00:18:08.550 --> 00:18:10.643\nDo I have little scripts\nthat run when I log out?\n\n336\n00:18:10.643 --> 00:18:14.600\nBash_profile, well that's\ngonna be when I get connected,\n\n337\n00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:16.800\nwhat do I want my prompt to look like?\n\n338\n00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:19.180\nWhat variables or aliases do I want?\n\n339\n00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:24.830\nAnd then bashrc is just the general\nconfig file for the bash shell itself.\n\n340\n00:18:24.830 --> 00:18:27.770\nI didn't create these,\nthese are created automatically, and\n\n341\n00:18:27.770 --> 00:18:32.080\nthese are ones that most users never have\nto deal with, and so they're hidden.\n\n342\n00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:35.020\nIn Linux we can hide a file really\neasy just by sticking a dot\n\n343\n00:18:35.020 --> 00:18:36.340\nat the beginning of it, right.\n\n344\n00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:38.250\nYou'll notice that pattern\nas you look across these.\n\n345\n00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:41.060\nAll of them have a period at\nthe beginning of the file name and\n\n346\n00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:44.700\nthat just means hide this file,\ndon't show this file to the end user.\n\n347\n00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:47.126\nSo if they run ls, they don't see them.\n\n348\n00:18:47.126 --> 00:18:50.398\nIf they run ls -a, they do.\n\n349\n00:18:50.398 --> 00:18:51.490\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Okay.\n\n350\n00:18:51.490 --> 00:18:54.190\nNow how did I now to do -a?\n\n351\n00:18:54.190 --> 00:18:55.124\nAll right?\n\n352\n00:18:55.124 --> 00:18:56.815\nWell the short answer's I memorized it,\nright?\n\n353\n00:18:56.815 --> 00:18:59.810\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Memorized it 20 years ago.\n\n354\n00:18:59.810 --> 00:19:03.940\nBut if you didn't know,\nwell almost every command\n\n355\n00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:08.470\nhas a massive laundry list\nof command modifiers.\n\n356\n00:19:08.470 --> 00:19:14.594\nAnd if you want to see them, often times\nyou can just run whatever the command is,\n\n357\n00:19:14.594 --> 00:19:16.952\nfollowed by -?, all right?\n\n358\n00:19:16.952 --> 00:19:20.080\nDash question mark is usually the one\nthat's gonna give us what we want.\n\n359\n00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:21.480\nThere are some variations.\n\n360\n00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:25.620\nYou'll see some commands where\nyou have to do -h for help,\n\n361\n00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:28.210\nwhich is working on less and\nless commands these days.\n\n362\n00:19:28.210 --> 00:19:30.500\nSome of them will use --help.\n\n363\n00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:34.050\nA double dash gives them a whole\nsecond set of command line modifiers\n\n364\n00:19:34.050 --> 00:19:34.830\nthey can use.\n\n365\n00:19:34.830 --> 00:19:39.330\nSo it might be something like that, but\nthe most common one is just do a -?, and\n\n366\n00:19:39.330 --> 00:19:41.840\nwhen you do that,\nit'll give you the output or\n\n367\n00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:43.470\nit'll tell you I should've done --help.\n\n368\n00:19:43.470 --> 00:19:46.810\nSo I'll do --help, all right?\n\n369\n00:19:46.810 --> 00:19:51.430\nAnd when I run that it's gonna show me\nsome of the various command line modifiers\n\n370\n00:19:51.430 --> 00:19:57.710\nthat, whoops, that would've been available\nfor me if I wanted to, all right?\n\n371\n00:19:57.710 --> 00:20:00.170\nNow, like many things\nin the command prompt,\n\n372\n00:20:00.170 --> 00:20:03.910\nthere was more than what would fit on my\nscreen, so a lot of it scrolled off, and\n\n373\n00:20:03.910 --> 00:20:06.320\nI'll talk about how to\ndeal with that later on.\n\n374\n00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:08.390\nBut when you look at this command output,\n\n375\n00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:12.812\nyou're gonna see all the different\nmodifiers that it can use.\n\n376\n00:20:12.812 --> 00:20:16.810\nAnd there's actually one other switch\nmodifier that I really like, which is,\n\n377\n00:20:16.810 --> 00:20:18.160\ndash l.\n\n378\n00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:22.730\nSo the default layout, like when I\ndid ls -a, I just see those files,\n\n379\n00:20:22.730 --> 00:20:23.860\nand that's it, right?\n\n380\n00:20:24.990 --> 00:20:27.940\nBut if you add an l,\nthat tells it to use the long format,\n\n381\n00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:31.790\nand it's gonna give us more\ninformation like the size of the file,\n\n382\n00:20:31.790 --> 00:20:34.350\nwhen the file was modified,\nwhat permissions are on the file.\n\n383\n00:20:34.350 --> 00:20:36.240\nA lot more detailed information.\n\n384\n00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:40.500\nInformation a regular user doesn't need,\nbut as an administrator, you might.\n\n385\n00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:46.847\nSo more often than not I run ls -l -a,\nokay?\n\n386\n00:20:46.847 --> 00:20:52.720\nLs-l-a, that says show all files and\ndo the long format.\n\n387\n00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:57.270\nNow in Windows they're pretty strict\nabout making you separate these out.\n\n388\n00:20:57.270 --> 00:21:00.120\nBut in Linux it's all about efficiency.\n\n389\n00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:04.023\nAnd so when we do more than\none command line modifier,\n\n390\n00:21:04.023 --> 00:21:07.774\nyou can actually combine them like this,\nls -la.\n\n391\n00:21:07.774 --> 00:21:10.835\nThe dash tells it it's\na command line modifier, and\n\n392\n00:21:10.835 --> 00:21:13.906\nthen la is telling it those two options,\nall right?\n\n393\n00:21:13.906 --> 00:21:17.396\nAnd when I run that,\nI get the same list of files,\n\n394\n00:21:17.396 --> 00:21:20.802\nbut I can see the permissions\nassigned to them,\n\n395\n00:21:20.802 --> 00:21:26.470\nas well as the size of the file and\nthe date that it was modified or created.\n\n396\n00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:28.930\nAnd then we see the files\nlisted right over there.\n\n397\n00:21:28.930 --> 00:21:34.016\nThis is a lot more informative to me and\nso ls -la that's normally what I run.\n\n398\n00:21:34.016 --> 00:21:36.579\nI run it so often,\nI usually put a shortcut in for it.\n\n399\n00:21:36.579 --> 00:21:37.313\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n400\n00:21:37.313 --> 00:21:40.800\nyou'll see that with\nall of these commands.\n\n401\n00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:44.120\nI'm gonna cover the most\nimportant modifiers,\n\n402\n00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:46.680\nthe ones that you need to have memorized.\n\n403\n00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:49.930\nThe other ones, cuz there's a lot of them,\nthe other ones, when you need them,\n\n404\n00:21:49.930 --> 00:21:53.780\nyou can typically just pull up the Help\nto see what they are and then use them.\n\n405\n00:21:53.780 --> 00:21:56.610\nCuz you just don't use them frequently\nenough to get them really memorized.\n\n406\n00:21:56.610 --> 00:21:57.890\nBut I'm gonna cover\nthe most important ones,\n\n407\n00:21:57.890 --> 00:22:02.660\nand if you're rapidly scribbling\ndown notes, don't worry.\n\n408\n00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:06.110\nI actually have a little cheat sheet\nbeside me here to make sure that I\n\n409\n00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:09.020\nremember all the commands to cover.\n\n410\n00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:12.610\nAnd so I'll post that with the episode so\nyou'll have it.\n\n411\n00:22:12.610 --> 00:22:14.240\n>> Don, I have a question here.\n\n412\n00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:16.150\nWe had mentioned the idea\nof the different shells,\n\n413\n00:22:16.150 --> 00:22:19.690\nis there a reason why we would\nchoose to change a shell,\n\n414\n00:22:19.690 --> 00:22:23.760\nagain coming from the Windows world and\nnot being as familiar, would I choose\n\n415\n00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:27.090\nthe idea of running something like C\nshell over just the regular batch?\n\n416\n00:22:27.090 --> 00:22:30.580\n>> You can, you certainly can, and\nthere's different reasons for it.\n\n417\n00:22:30.580 --> 00:22:32.170\nI personally try to avoid it.\n\n418\n00:22:32.170 --> 00:22:35.380\n>> Okay.\n>> I try to avoid changing the shell,\n\n419\n00:22:35.380 --> 00:22:40.430\njust because I know that if I'm working\non 50 different systems, I don't wanna\n\n420\n00:22:40.430 --> 00:22:44.080\nhave to go and change my shell in all\n50 and I want a consistent environment.\n\n421\n00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:47.169\nSo I typically stick with the default one.\n\n422\n00:22:47.169 --> 00:22:48.202\nBut there are advantages.\n\n423\n00:22:48.202 --> 00:22:52.882\nSome of the other shells like the C shell,\nc-s-h, that one in particular,\n\n424\n00:22:52.882 --> 00:22:58.066\nit's designed where you can actually type\nin the C programming language basically,\n\n425\n00:22:58.066 --> 00:23:00.946\nyou can type that right\ninto the command line and\n\n426\n00:23:00.946 --> 00:23:04.350\nit will basically compile and\nexecute on the fly.\n\n427\n00:23:04.350 --> 00:23:07.530\nAnd if you're a developer, that's\na really powerful thing to have, right?\n\n428\n00:23:07.530 --> 00:23:09.960\nThe other shells have functionality\nthat's similar to that, but\n\n429\n00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:11.350\nit might not be as powerful.\n\n430\n00:23:11.350 --> 00:23:15.130\nAnd so as a developer that shell might\nbe better suited to what you want to do.\n\n431\n00:23:15.130 --> 00:23:18.550\nSo certainly if you have a shell that\nyou like more than the other ones,\n\n432\n00:23:18.550 --> 00:23:20.920\nit has some feature that you like,\nyou can pick it.\n\n433\n00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:24.170\nAnd you'll find support on pretty\n\n434\n00:23:24.170 --> 00:23:27.140\nmuch any of the distros out there if\nyou want to load the different shells.\n\n435\n00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:29.710\nA lot of them are loaded by default.\n\n436\n00:23:29.710 --> 00:23:33.000\nWe'll talk about user account\ncreation in another episode.\n\n437\n00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:34.300\nAnd when you create a user account,\n\n438\n00:23:34.300 --> 00:23:37.360\nyou can specify what you want\ntheir default shell to be.\n\n439\n00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:40.240\nSo you could overwrite on\na per user basis if you want.\n\n440\n00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:41.200\n>> Okay, nice.\n\n441\n00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:42.950\n>> But just my rule of thumb,\n\n442\n00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:47.160\nis I typically don't overwrite it\nbecause I want it to be consistent.\n\n443\n00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:50.330\nIf I've got a CentOS 6.5\nmachine right here, and\n\n444\n00:23:50.330 --> 00:23:54.350\nI'm going over to a CentOS 6.5 machine\nover there, I want the same interface, and\n\n445\n00:23:54.350 --> 00:23:56.340\nI don't want to have to\nremember to override my shell.\n\n446\n00:23:56.340 --> 00:23:57.119\n>> Sounds good.\n\n447\n00:23:57.119 --> 00:23:58.928\n>> That's my rule of thumb.\n\n448\n00:23:58.928 --> 00:24:03.100\nAll right, now when we look at this\ndirectory, I see those four files, and\n\n449\n00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:06.164\nI see a bunch of other\ninformation about them, right?\n\n450\n00:24:06.164 --> 00:24:08.928\nSo what is some of this other\ninformation that's in here?\n\n451\n00:24:08.928 --> 00:24:10.043\nHere, all right?\n\n452\n00:24:10.043 --> 00:24:13.720\nWell, we'll go right to left cuz it\nmakes a little more sense that way.\n\n453\n00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:15.251\nOn the far right side,\nI get the file name.\n\n454\n00:24:15.251 --> 00:24:17.780\nSo here's all those different\nfilenames that are in there.\n\n455\n00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:21.450\nAnd in fact,\nwe're dealing with hidden files here.\n\n456\n00:24:21.450 --> 00:24:28.170\nLet me create some normal files,\nso maybe I have readme.txt.\n\n457\n00:24:28.170 --> 00:24:32.060\nI'm using the touch command, touch is\na nice command, because what it does,\n\n458\n00:24:32.060 --> 00:24:33.560\nit just creates a file.\n\n459\n00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:37.460\nSo I just created a file called\nreadme.txt, there's nothing in it,\n\n460\n00:24:37.460 --> 00:24:38.350\nit's an empty file.\n\n461\n00:24:38.350 --> 00:24:41.542\nSo it's just a quick way to\ncreate files if you need them.\n\n462\n00:24:41.542 --> 00:24:46.630\nNot something we necessarily\nuse on a given day.\n\n463\n00:24:46.630 --> 00:24:49.300\nSo I'm just kinda creating\nthat read me file.\n\n464\n00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:51.740\nAnd so now, if I do the ls command,\n\n465\n00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:54.410\nI can see that read me file\nbecause it's not hidden.\n\n466\n00:24:54.410 --> 00:24:55.386\nRight?\nIt doesn't have a dot\n\n467\n00:24:55.386 --> 00:24:56.680\nat the beginning of its name.\n\n468\n00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:58.360\nSo it's not a hidden file.\n\n469\n00:24:58.360 --> 00:25:05.950\nIf I did a .readme.txt like that, right,\nnow there's actually two readme files.\n\n470\n00:25:05.950 --> 00:25:08.140\nOne that's hidden and one that's not.\n\n471\n00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:12.210\nAnd so if I do my ls,\nI see the one that's not hidden.\n\n472\n00:25:12.210 --> 00:25:18.060\nIf I do my ls -a, I see the one that's\nhidden, and the one that's not hidden.\n\n473\n00:25:18.060 --> 00:25:20.280\nIt's two separate files, all right?\n\n474\n00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:24.450\nBecause that dot is part of the file name,\nthese are different names.\n\n475\n00:25:24.450 --> 00:25:25.560\nOkay.\n\n476\n00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:30.270\nYou know actually while I'm doing this,\nit's probably worth pointing out that\n\n477\n00:25:30.270 --> 00:25:33.400\nalmost everything in\nthe Unix command prompt and\n\n478\n00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:35.860\nthe Linux prompts are case sensitive.\n\n479\n00:25:35.860 --> 00:25:37.050\nAll right?\n\n480\n00:25:37.050 --> 00:25:41.731\nNot all but most of the Starnix\noperating systems work to\n\n481\n00:25:41.731 --> 00:25:44.625\nbe with called posix compliance.\n\n482\n00:25:44.625 --> 00:25:46.670\nPosix, P-O-S-I-X.\n\n483\n00:25:46.670 --> 00:25:49.820\nIt's kinda of a set of guidelines\n\n484\n00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:53.970\nthat if an operating system meets all the\nguidelines it'll be more compatible with\n\n485\n00:25:53.970 --> 00:25:56.160\nother systems that meet\nthose same guidelines.\n\n486\n00:25:56.160 --> 00:26:00.850\nAnd one of the POSIX requirements is that\nfile names should be case sensitive.\n\n487\n00:26:00.850 --> 00:26:05.000\nSo if I have a file called readme.txt,\nthat's fine but\n\n488\n00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:09.680\nI might also have a file\ncalled Readme.txt or\n\n489\n00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:15.300\nanother file called ReadMe.txt or\na file called whatever.\n\n490\n00:26:15.300 --> 00:26:17.490\nNotice these are the same names.\n\n491\n00:26:17.490 --> 00:26:20.390\nBut I'm changing the case\nof some of the letters.\n\n492\n00:26:20.390 --> 00:26:24.625\nThe first one that I\nmade was all lowercase.\n\n493\n00:26:24.625 --> 00:26:28.325\nThe second one I made had a capital R,\nthe third one I made had a capital R and\n\n494\n00:26:28.325 --> 00:26:29.002\na capital M.\n\n495\n00:26:29.002 --> 00:26:34.175\nAnd if I do an all caps one, right,\ncuz I'm gonna shout it at you, right?\n\n496\n00:26:34.175 --> 00:26:37.455\nWhat I just did is I made\nfour different files.\n\n497\n00:26:37.455 --> 00:26:40.900\nIf I look at my directory\nsee them all right there?\n\n498\n00:26:40.900 --> 00:26:43.560\nOkay, that's very non Windows.\n\n499\n00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:49.550\nSo, some operating systems treat file\nnames without worrying about case.\n\n500\n00:26:49.550 --> 00:26:54.590\nThey're case insensitive but in almost\nall of the Unix based operating systems,\n\n501\n00:26:54.590 --> 00:26:58.420\nUnix like operating systems,\nyou have case sensitive file names.\n\n502\n00:26:58.420 --> 00:26:59.840\nSo, be aware of that.\n\n503\n00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:03.500\nJust sticking a dot at the beginning of\nthe filename makes it a whole new file.\n\n504\n00:27:03.500 --> 00:27:05.530\nIt is not changing a file\nthat you've already got.\n\n505\n00:27:05.530 --> 00:27:06.620\nAll right.\n\n506\n00:27:06.620 --> 00:27:10.418\nAnd having that different casing\ncan lead to different things there.\n\n507\n00:27:10.418 --> 00:27:16.013\nSo definitely, be aware that\nfile names are case sensitive.\n\n508\n00:27:16.013 --> 00:27:21.230\nAll right, so\nI was talking about the output of ls-LA.\n\n509\n00:27:21.230 --> 00:27:22.959\nNow I've got a lot more files.\n\n510\n00:27:22.959 --> 00:27:24.914\n[LAUGH] So when I look at this,\n\n511\n00:27:24.914 --> 00:27:30.840\non the far right side I am seeing\nthe file name and listed case sensitive.\n\n512\n00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:33.750\nNext, I've got when that file was created.\n\n513\n00:27:33.750 --> 00:27:37.610\nThese were all created\nJune 18th which is today.\n\n514\n00:27:37.610 --> 00:27:39.960\nThere's some that were created July 18,\n2013.\n\n515\n00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:41.626\nThat's almost a year ago.\n\n516\n00:27:41.626 --> 00:27:45.338\nThat's because those were created when\nI installed the operating system,\n\n517\n00:27:45.338 --> 00:27:47.330\nas part of the CentOS install.\n\n518\n00:27:47.330 --> 00:27:50.870\nBut these, I just created now,\nso they've all got today's date.\n\n519\n00:27:50.870 --> 00:27:54.250\nNow I use the touch command,\nwhich created empty files.\n\n520\n00:27:54.250 --> 00:27:58.650\nSo for their size, that's this next\ncolumn, I see all zeroes, okay?\n\n521\n00:27:58.650 --> 00:28:03.590\nNow the size is listed here in bytes,\nso these are zero bytes.\n\n522\n00:28:03.590 --> 00:28:06.890\nThese guys, 124 bytes, 176 bytes.\n\n523\n00:28:06.890 --> 00:28:11.917\nThis guy here is 4,096 bytes,\nwhich would actually be 4 kilobytes.\n\n524\n00:28:11.917 --> 00:28:12.660\nAll right?\n\n525\n00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:15.820\nSo, remember that you know, as the file\ngets larger that number gets larger.\n\n526\n00:28:15.820 --> 00:28:19.960\nAnd so when you have megabytes and\ngigabytes and terabytes, right?\n\n527\n00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:23.420\nYou'll have numbers in the millions,\nthe billions, the trillions, right?\n\n528\n00:28:23.420 --> 00:28:27.292\nAs you accommodate that amount of storage,\nso that's listed in bytes.\n\n529\n00:28:27.292 --> 00:28:28.668\n>> Mm hm.\n\n530\n00:28:28.668 --> 00:28:32.020\n>> Next I see who is the,\nI see two things.\n\n531\n00:28:32.020 --> 00:28:33.400\nThese are kinda related.\n\n532\n00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:37.360\nOn the left side,\nI'm seeing the owner of the file.\n\n533\n00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:38.970\nWho made this file?\n\n534\n00:28:38.970 --> 00:28:39.740\nAll right?\n\n535\n00:28:39.740 --> 00:28:44.650\nAnd then the next thing I see is\nthe group that this file is attached to.\n\n536\n00:28:44.650 --> 00:28:47.540\nIn our security episode we're\ngonna talk about users and\n\n537\n00:28:47.540 --> 00:28:50.480\ngroups, so every user has to\nbe in at least one group,\n\n538\n00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:54.120\nand that one group that they're gonna\nbe in has the same name as them.\n\n539\n00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:58.360\nSo, there's a dpezet user account and\nthere's a dpezet group, all right.\n\n540\n00:28:58.360 --> 00:29:03.160\nThis is important because whoever is\nthe owner has full access to the file and\n\n541\n00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:05.080\ncan do whatever they want to that file.\n\n542\n00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:10.860\nThe group, well, we might wanna give\nother people access to that file, and\n\n543\n00:29:10.860 --> 00:29:13.630\nwe can do that easily by\nputting them into this group,\n\n544\n00:29:13.630 --> 00:29:16.410\nor attaching a different group to it.\n\n545\n00:29:16.410 --> 00:29:20.890\nAnd that kind of leads us to\nthis next set of columns here.\n\n546\n00:29:20.890 --> 00:29:25.288\nYou'll see a couple of things in here,\nsome of this is special.\n\n547\n00:29:25.288 --> 00:29:27.390\nI don't wanna dive into it right now, but\n\n548\n00:29:27.390 --> 00:29:30.560\nwhat you're seeing here\nare our permissions entries.\n\n549\n00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:34.590\nOn the far left, there's an entry\nthat's either gonna be a d or a dash.\n\n550\n00:29:34.590 --> 00:29:38.320\nThe d tells you it's a directory,\nand a dash tells you its a file.\n\n551\n00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:41.870\nSo that's how the system keeps track\nof whether it's a directory or a file.\n\n552\n00:29:41.870 --> 00:29:44.710\nThen, it's gonna be followed\nwith nine characters.\n\n553\n00:29:44.710 --> 00:29:50.270\nThe nine characters are either gonna be r,\nw, x, or dash.\n\n554\n00:29:50.270 --> 00:29:52.300\nThese are permissions, okay?\n\n555\n00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:55.670\nThe first three denote\nthe permission of the owner.\n\n556\n00:29:55.670 --> 00:30:00.880\nWhether they have read, write, or\nexecute permissions on that file.\n\n557\n00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:02.300\nRead, they can read it.\n\n558\n00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:04.110\nThey can open it and\nlook at what's in there.\n\n559\n00:30:04.110 --> 00:30:05.820\nWrite, they can change it.\n\n560\n00:30:05.820 --> 00:30:07.706\nThey can make changes to the data and\nsave it.\n\n561\n00:30:08.890 --> 00:30:13.520\nExecute the x that means if it's\na program or a script they can run it.\n\n562\n00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:14.230\nAll right?\n\n563\n00:30:14.230 --> 00:30:16.740\nYou'll notice I don't have\nexecute on any of these so\n\n564\n00:30:16.740 --> 00:30:20.330\nwhile I am the owner I can read and\nwrite them but I can't run them.\n\n565\n00:30:20.330 --> 00:30:22.410\nSo if I were to stick script\nexecution inside of them,\n\n566\n00:30:22.410 --> 00:30:24.350\nit's not gonna work, right?\n\n567\n00:30:24.350 --> 00:30:26.250\nThe next three are for the group.\n\n568\n00:30:26.250 --> 00:30:32.060\nSo anybody in the dpezet group can read\nand write, but can't execute, right.\n\n569\n00:30:32.060 --> 00:30:35.377\nAnd then the next three are for\neverybody else.\n\n570\n00:30:35.377 --> 00:30:36.000\nEverybody else.\n\n571\n00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:37.240\nIf you're not the owner and\n\n572\n00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:41.250\nyou're not the group attached\nto this file, what do you get?\n\n573\n00:30:41.250 --> 00:30:44.350\nAnd so I've got right here that\neverybody else can read this file.\n\n574\n00:30:44.350 --> 00:30:47.400\nThey can't write to it, they can't\nchange it, but they can read to it.\n\n575\n00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:49.440\nSo these are simple permissions.\n\n576\n00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:53.310\nPermissions tracked based on user,\ngroup, and everyone else.\n\n577\n00:30:54.370 --> 00:30:57.340\nDon't worry about that too much right now,\nwe have a security up so\n\n578\n00:30:57.340 --> 00:30:58.500\nit will tackle that.\n\n579\n00:30:58.500 --> 00:31:01.866\nAnd these next couple of ones here\nare special values like the dot and\n\n580\n00:31:01.866 --> 00:31:03.293\nthe one and stuff like that.\n\n581\n00:31:03.293 --> 00:31:06.623\nWe're gonna get a chance to see that\nagain in our advance episode so\n\n582\n00:31:06.623 --> 00:31:08.000\nwe'll tackle this later.\n\n583\n00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:13.330\nIt's kinda hard to explain this special\nbits but, yeah we'll see those later.\n\n584\n00:31:13.330 --> 00:31:15.990\nAll right, so, that's some of the data\nthat we get in that output and\n\n585\n00:31:15.990 --> 00:31:18.050\nit's pretty useful stuff there are.\n\n586\n00:31:18.050 --> 00:31:21.050\nA couple of things that I kinda\ndidn't cover like the dot and\n\n587\n00:31:21.050 --> 00:31:22.888\nthe double dot that appear right here.\n\n588\n00:31:22.888 --> 00:31:26.440\nIt's actually kinda hard to see on the\nscreen because of this coloring of blue.\n\n589\n00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:28.460\nBlue on black is not the best contrast.\n\n590\n00:31:28.460 --> 00:31:33.542\nBut, there is a dot and\na double dot in there and if we want.\n\n591\n00:31:33.542 --> 00:31:36.288\nWell, what I'm going a little\nahead of myself here.\n\n592\n00:31:36.288 --> 00:31:37.370\nSo I'm gonna hold off on that because we\n\n593\n00:31:37.370 --> 00:31:39.340\nhave not really gotten\ninto file tabs to much.\n\n594\n00:31:39.340 --> 00:31:41.180\nSo we'll tackle those in a minute.\n\n595\n00:31:41.180 --> 00:31:44.590\nBut looking at the clock I've already\ntalked longer than I should have,\n\n596\n00:31:44.590 --> 00:31:46.420\nso let's stop here and take a break.\n\n597\n00:31:46.420 --> 00:31:49.748\nWhen we get back, we're gonna go and\ntake a look at some more commands,\n\n598\n00:31:49.748 --> 00:31:51.911\nstart actually moving around the system,\nand\n\n599\n00:31:51.911 --> 00:31:55.417\nwe'll talk about creating and\nediting files and some other things there.\n\n600\n00:31:55.417 --> 00:31:57.061\nSo, let's stop here and take a break.\n\n601\n00:31:57.061 --> 00:31:58.463\nWe'll be back after this.\n\n602\n00:31:58.463 --> 00:32:06.275\n[MUSIC]\n\n603\n00:32:06.275 --> 00:32:07.828\nAll right, welcome back everybody.\n\n604\n00:32:07.828 --> 00:32:12.106\nSo before the break, we were taking a look\nat the list command and then taking a look\n\n605\n00:32:12.106 --> 00:32:16.390\nat the directory listing and I pointed out\ntwo little entries that were at the top.\n\n606\n00:32:16.390 --> 00:32:17.820\nA dot and a double dot.\n\n607\n00:32:17.820 --> 00:32:18.730\nAnd what the heck are those?\n\n608\n00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:23.340\nWell, at the beginning of the episode we\ntalked a little bit about our file path.\n\n609\n00:32:23.340 --> 00:32:26.950\nAnd I did a pwd, so\nprint working directory.\n\n610\n00:32:26.950 --> 00:32:30.640\nAnd I saw that I was in /home/dpezet,\ngreat.\n\n611\n00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:35.120\nWell, as you navigate around the system,\nyou're gonna move into different folders\n\n612\n00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:38.360\nand there are a couple of shortcuts\nthat are present that you can use,\n\n613\n00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:40.070\nlittle directory aliases.\n\n614\n00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:43.460\nAnd the dot and\nthe double-dot are examples of that.\n\n615\n00:32:43.460 --> 00:32:48.700\nThe single dot, that represents\nthe directory you're in right now.\n\n616\n00:32:48.700 --> 00:32:52.808\nSo show me what's in this\ndirectory right now, with a dot.\n\n617\n00:32:52.808 --> 00:32:58.050\nThe double dot says show me what's in the\nparent directory, the directory above us.\n\n618\n00:32:58.050 --> 00:33:01.540\nThe next directory higher\nthan where we are right now.\n\n619\n00:33:01.540 --> 00:33:04.320\nSo if I combine those with the ls command,\n\n620\n00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:09.520\nif I do ls that's showing me\nwhat's in this directory.\n\n621\n00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:15.255\nIt's implied that I'm\nactually typing ls ./.\n\n622\n00:33:15.255 --> 00:33:18.630\nThen, dot represents\nthe folder I'm in right now.\n\n623\n00:33:18.630 --> 00:33:23.898\nNow, remember when I ran pwd,\nit told me my folder was /home/dpezet.\n\n624\n00:33:23.898 --> 00:33:30.905\nSo when you run ls ./,\nyou're saying give me a listing of dot.\n\n625\n00:33:30.905 --> 00:33:33.875\nIn other words, /home/dpezet/.\n\n626\n00:33:33.875 --> 00:33:35.825\nSo what's in this folder?\n\n627\n00:33:35.825 --> 00:33:38.525\nAnd when I run it,\nI get the exact same output.\n\n628\n00:33:38.525 --> 00:33:40.895\nThat's implied in the ls command.\n\n629\n00:33:40.895 --> 00:33:44.915\nSo when I just run it, it assumes that\nI meant the directory that I'm in.\n\n630\n00:33:46.125 --> 00:33:53.158\nBut if I modify that command just a little\nbit and I add a second dot, ls ../.\n\n631\n00:33:53.158 --> 00:34:00.850\nNow, what it's gonna do is it's\ngonna look at /home/dpezet and\n\n632\n00:34:00.850 --> 00:34:04.720\nthen .., is gonna go back up\nto the home directory and\n\n633\n00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:07.330\nthen give me a list of what's\nin the home directory.\n\n634\n00:34:07.330 --> 00:34:09.760\nThe directory above us.\n\n635\n00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:14.120\nSo if I run that, I can see there's\none file in there called dpezet,\n\n636\n00:34:14.120 --> 00:34:15.260\nthat's my folder.\n\n637\n00:34:15.260 --> 00:34:18.490\nAnd folders it highlights in blue,\nin Cent OS.\n\n638\n00:34:18.490 --> 00:34:21.064\nDifferent distributions\ndo it different ways but\n\n639\n00:34:21.064 --> 00:34:23.766\nin Cent OS the folder names\nare highlighted in blue.\n\n640\n00:34:23.766 --> 00:34:25.830\nIt's a kinda hard to see,\nI guess on the black.\n\n641\n00:34:25.830 --> 00:34:29.230\nBut it says dpezet that's my folder name.\n\n642\n00:34:29.230 --> 00:34:33.060\nAnd so, I'm in /home/dpezet,\nit's showing the parent.\n\n643\n00:34:33.060 --> 00:34:37.460\nYou can actually start to stack these,\nand say, like that,\n\n644\n00:34:37.460 --> 00:34:42.330\nls ../../, that says go up two levels.\n\n645\n00:34:42.330 --> 00:34:45.467\nSo don't just go to home,\ngo all the way up to the root,\n\n646\n00:34:45.467 --> 00:34:47.808\nall the way up to slash in this scenario.\n\n647\n00:34:47.808 --> 00:34:50.157\nAnd it would show me two levels higher,\nand\n\n648\n00:34:50.157 --> 00:34:52.320\nI can see I got a lot more stuff in there.\n\n649\n00:34:53.700 --> 00:34:58.200\nSo [COUGH] these little modifiers\nthey really do allow us in some good\n\n650\n00:34:58.200 --> 00:35:01.380\nflexibility with our command and it all\ncomes down to that directory structure.\n\n651\n00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:05.540\nThere are other aliases in place though.\n\n652\n00:35:05.540 --> 00:35:09.596\nFor example,\nif I just wanna see a particular folder,\n\n653\n00:35:09.596 --> 00:35:14.459\nlike if I wanna see the root folder slash,\nI could just type ls/.\n\n654\n00:35:14.459 --> 00:35:16.378\nShow me what's in the root folder.\n\n655\n00:35:16.378 --> 00:35:18.900\nls/ there it is.\n\n656\n00:35:18.900 --> 00:35:24.540\nAnd that was the same as ../../,\ncuz that's saying that's relative.\n\n657\n00:35:24.540 --> 00:35:28.910\nFrom where I am right now, go up one\nfolder, go up another folder, and\n\n658\n00:35:28.910 --> 00:35:30.090\nshow me what's there.\n\n659\n00:35:30.090 --> 00:35:32.740\nAnd that just happens to be at that point,\nslash.\n\n660\n00:35:32.740 --> 00:35:34.920\nAnd ls / that shows me the same thing.\n\n661\n00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:36.190\nSo that gets me there.\n\n662\n00:35:36.190 --> 00:35:41.488\nI could also do ls /home, so\nshow me what's in that home folder, and\n\n663\n00:35:41.488 --> 00:35:46.390\nls / home/dpezet,\nShow me what's in my folder.\n\n664\n00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:50.500\nSo the folder structure\nis kinda important there.\n\n665\n00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:56.190\nSome of the other aliases that we have,\nmy home directory.\n\n666\n00:35:56.190 --> 00:36:01.210\nRemember in the prompt here,\nI've got that little tilde and\n\n667\n00:36:01.210 --> 00:36:05.080\nthat tilde is a shortcut that\nreferences your home directory.\n\n668\n00:36:05.080 --> 00:36:09.420\nSo when we run a command, or whatever,\nif it's in our home directory,\n\n669\n00:36:09.420 --> 00:36:15.260\nwe can always say ls /home/dpezet,\nwe could type it all the way out.\n\n670\n00:36:15.260 --> 00:36:21.755\nThere's my home directory,\nor I could type ls ~/.\n\n671\n00:36:21.755 --> 00:36:24.820\nThat tilde meaning show\nme my home directory.\n\n672\n00:36:24.820 --> 00:36:27.710\nAnd when I run that,\nit's the same set of files.\n\n673\n00:36:27.710 --> 00:36:33.120\nSo tilde is just a shortcut\nreferencing your own home directory.\n\n674\n00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:36.060\nSo dot references\nthe directory that you're in.\n\n675\n00:36:37.110 --> 00:36:41.030\nDot dot references\nthe directory above you.\n\n676\n00:36:41.030 --> 00:36:43.810\nAnd then tilde represents\nyou're home directory.\n\n677\n00:36:43.810 --> 00:36:46.400\nA couple nice little shortcuts to\nmake jumping around really quick.\n\n678\n00:36:47.570 --> 00:36:50.430\nThere's one other shortcut I wanna\nshow you, but it's not gonna work for\n\n679\n00:36:50.430 --> 00:36:52.930\nme right now cuz I haven't\ndone the right steps.\n\n680\n00:36:52.930 --> 00:36:57.510\nSo there's one more little shortcut\nthat we'll see in just a moment.\n\n681\n00:36:57.510 --> 00:37:01.440\nNow, when I'm doing work,\nwhen I start messing with files,\n\n682\n00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:04.830\nlike when I run touch and I did ReadMe,\n\n683\n00:37:04.830 --> 00:37:10.410\nI'll just make another one, you can never\nhave too many of these crazy files.\n\n684\n00:37:10.410 --> 00:37:13.100\nWhen I did touch ReadMe,\nthat creates that ReadMe file.\n\n685\n00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:16.350\nAnd I did not specify any path.\n\n686\n00:37:16.350 --> 00:37:20.390\nAnd so, what this is saying is create\nit in the folder I'm in right now.\n\n687\n00:37:21.710 --> 00:37:23.920\nBut I could have stuck\na directory on there and\n\n688\n00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:29.320\nsaid touch/readme.text and then it\nwould try and create it in the root.\n\n689\n00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:32.510\nNow, I'm a regular user, I probably\ndon't have permission to do that.\n\n690\n00:37:32.510 --> 00:37:37.240\nAnd I could even say /home/readme.text and\nit will create it in that folder.\n\n691\n00:37:37.240 --> 00:37:41.760\nBut again I probably don't\nhave that permission, but\n\n692\n00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:44.870\nwe can use these to kinda specify\nwhere we wanna create that in.\n\n693\n00:37:44.870 --> 00:37:49.340\nBut if you're gonna be running a lot\nof commands in a particular folder,\n\n694\n00:37:49.340 --> 00:37:53.130\nit can get annoying having to type\nthat folder name in every time so\n\n695\n00:37:53.130 --> 00:37:56.540\nyou can do what's called\nchanging your working directory.\n\n696\n00:37:56.540 --> 00:38:00.544\nPWD showed me what directory\nI was in right now.\n\n697\n00:38:00.544 --> 00:38:03.670\nSo I'm in /home/dpezet.\n\n698\n00:38:03.670 --> 00:38:05.540\nIf I leave off a directory name,\n\n699\n00:38:05.540 --> 00:38:08.510\nwhatever I run is gonna be running\nin this folder right there.\n\n700\n00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:13.810\nBut I can change to a different\ndirectory and now whenever I run,\n\n701\n00:38:13.810 --> 00:38:16.100\nwe'll run in that directory.\n\n702\n00:38:16.100 --> 00:38:18.670\nSo for example,\nthe command to do it is cd.\n\n703\n00:38:18.670 --> 00:38:20.160\ncd is changed directory.\n\n704\n00:38:21.380 --> 00:38:28.230\nAnd if I do cd /home, that's gonna\nmove me into the home directory,\n\n705\n00:38:28.230 --> 00:38:32.320\nand notice my prompt changed,\ninstead of a tilde, it now says home.\n\n706\n00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:33.680\nI'm in the home directory.\n\n707\n00:38:34.740 --> 00:38:39.420\nAnd if I do an ls I'm listing\nfiles in that home directory.\n\n708\n00:38:39.420 --> 00:38:43.630\nAnd if I do a pwd,\nI can see that I'm in /home.\n\n709\n00:38:43.630 --> 00:38:47.390\nSo cd, change directory,\nwe can move wherever we want.\n\n710\n00:38:47.390 --> 00:38:52.630\nWe can type cd / and\nnow I'm in the root, and if I do a ls,\n\n711\n00:38:52.630 --> 00:38:56.330\nI'll see there's all the root files and\nmy prompt now shows just a slash.\n\n712\n00:38:57.820 --> 00:39:01.160\nSo kinda easy way there\nto see where you're at.\n\n713\n00:39:01.160 --> 00:39:04.320\nAnd now every command I\nissue is gonna be issued\n\n714\n00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:06.880\nfrom the perspective of\nthis particular directory.\n\n715\n00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:12.844\nNow, this is where some of the shortcuts\ncome in handy because if I\n\n716\n00:39:12.844 --> 00:39:15.523\nwanna change in to my home directory,\n\n717\n00:39:15.523 --> 00:39:20.148\nI could type cd home, cd dpezet and\nnow I'm in my home directory.\n\n718\n00:39:20.148 --> 00:39:26.013\nOr I could of typed cd/home/dpezet and\nI'm back in my home directory but\n\n719\n00:39:26.013 --> 00:39:31.513\nyou know what woulda been easier,\nwould have just been to type cd ~.\n\n720\n00:39:31.513 --> 00:39:33.993\ncd ~, that changes me into\nmy home directory, and\n\n721\n00:39:33.993 --> 00:39:35.900\nI can see that I'm right there.\n\n722\n00:39:35.900 --> 00:39:38.530\nThose aliases are really handy.\n\n723\n00:39:38.530 --> 00:39:40.920\nAnd that leads to my next alias.\n\n724\n00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:45.150\nI just changed from the slash,\nfrom the root folder.\n\n725\n00:39:45.150 --> 00:39:47.768\nSee how I did cd /.\n\n726\n00:39:47.768 --> 00:39:52.236\nSo it took me right to\nthe root of the drive.\n\n727\n00:39:52.236 --> 00:39:55.543\nAnd then I typed cd ~,\nthat jumped right to my home directory.\n\n728\n00:39:55.543 --> 00:39:56.564\nAll right.\n\n729\n00:39:56.564 --> 00:40:01.168\nIf I wanna jump back to whatever\ndirectory I just came from, so\n\n730\n00:40:01.168 --> 00:40:03.912\nwherever it is that I just came from,\n\n731\n00:40:03.912 --> 00:40:10.550\nyou can type cd The dash says\ntake me back to where I was last.\n\n732\n00:40:10.550 --> 00:40:12.730\nSo it's just the folder\nthat I just came from,\n\n733\n00:40:12.730 --> 00:40:15.580\nso it's a quick easy way\nto jump between folders.\n\n734\n00:40:15.580 --> 00:40:19.130\nIf you need to temporarily move to\nanother folder to make some change,\n\n735\n00:40:19.130 --> 00:40:25.870\nthen you cd dash, and it'll jump you\nright back to where you came from.\n\n736\n00:40:25.870 --> 00:40:31.235\nSo those are some pretty good aliases\nthere, and we can use the dot dots also.\n\n737\n00:40:31.235 --> 00:40:36.421\nSo if I'm in my home directory,\nI can type cd.\n\n738\n00:40:36.421 --> 00:40:37.613\nThat's not going to do anything.\n\n739\n00:40:37.613 --> 00:40:40.510\nChange the directory to\nthe directory that I'm already in.\n\n740\n00:40:40.510 --> 00:40:43.840\nThat's not gonna do anything, so\nI can see I'm still in the same place.\n\n741\n00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:50.430\nBut if I type cd .., that says change\ndirectory to whatever's above me.\n\n742\n00:40:50.430 --> 00:40:54.955\nSo cd if I then pull up my path,\nI can see that I'm not in /home.\n\n743\n00:40:54.955 --> 00:40:59.520\nAo we'll use these frequently throughout\nthe show, as we reference files and\n\n744\n00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:02.630\nother directories, as we move around\na Change our working directory.\n\n745\n00:41:02.630 --> 00:41:06.950\nSo understanding the cd, the changed\ndirectory command is pretty important and\n\n746\n00:41:06.950 --> 00:41:09.250\nunderstanding these little\naliases that we have.\n\n747\n00:41:10.970 --> 00:41:11.870\nAll right.\n\n748\n00:41:11.870 --> 00:41:14.520\nI also did one command here\nwithout thinking about it.\n\n749\n00:41:14.520 --> 00:41:15.355\nThis is the problem.\n\n750\n00:41:15.355 --> 00:41:18.470\nThese are really basic command you should\nhave them committed in memory that you\n\n751\n00:41:18.470 --> 00:41:22.640\ncome in second nature, and so sometimes\nI'll type these without thinking.\n\n752\n00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:27.110\nIf you are in a random directory, and\nyou wanna get back to your home directory,\n\n753\n00:41:27.110 --> 00:41:29.570\nyou can type cd tilde and\nthat'll take you there.\n\n754\n00:41:29.570 --> 00:41:32.370\nBut in a lot of distributions,\nif you just type cd by itself,\n\n755\n00:41:32.370 --> 00:41:35.010\nit will take you to your\nhome directory also.\n\n756\n00:41:35.010 --> 00:41:38.440\nIt's not in every distribution,\nbut in a lot of them, it does it.\n\n757\n00:41:38.440 --> 00:41:42.180\nSo cd by itself may represent cd tilde.\n\n758\n00:41:42.180 --> 00:41:44.630\nIt's always just quick and easy to check.\n\n759\n00:41:44.630 --> 00:41:46.260\nJust do cd by itself and\n\n760\n00:41:46.260 --> 00:41:49.110\nthen do a pwd to find out whether it\nactually went to your home directory.\n\n761\n00:41:51.100 --> 00:41:52.170\nAll right.\n\n762\n00:41:52.170 --> 00:41:56.440\nSo that's pretty much it for\nfolders and directory structure.\n\n763\n00:41:57.490 --> 00:42:01.900\nThe list command,\nsome of my output was colorized, so\n\n764\n00:42:01.900 --> 00:42:05.870\nwhen I do LS dash LA here on the root,\nyou can see a lot of this is colorized.\n\n765\n00:42:06.890 --> 00:42:09.890\nSome distributions do this, some don't.\n\n766\n00:42:09.890 --> 00:42:15.640\nIn the main GNU utility is the ones\nthat most Linux distributions use.\n\n767\n00:42:15.640 --> 00:42:17.660\nThe LS command is not colorized.\n\n768\n00:42:17.660 --> 00:42:20.280\nThat it's all just black and\nwhite, and that's it, but\n\n769\n00:42:20.280 --> 00:42:24.100\na lot of distros have adopted a newer\ncolorized one because it looks pretty, and\n\n770\n00:42:24.100 --> 00:42:25.835\nit differentiates files for you.\n\n771\n00:42:25.835 --> 00:42:30.560\nSo you can see folders listed as blue,\n\n772\n00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:35.560\nregular files are grey, special files\nmight be highlighted green like that.\n\n773\n00:42:35.560 --> 00:42:38.710\nExecutable files are normally\nwritten in green lettering.\n\n774\n00:42:38.710 --> 00:42:44.611\nSo like scripts,\nwhich I probably have something somewhere.\n\n775\n00:42:44.611 --> 00:42:45.760\nThere it is.\n\n776\n00:42:45.760 --> 00:42:47.170\nThere's a bunch.\n\n777\n00:42:47.170 --> 00:42:51.870\nSo you'll see executable files\nmaybe listed in green and\n\n778\n00:42:54.130 --> 00:42:57.330\nshoot, not executable files, but\naliases, we listed in light blue.\n\n779\n00:42:57.330 --> 00:42:59.570\nSo these will actually be tied\nto something somewhere else.\n\n780\n00:42:59.570 --> 00:43:02.550\nSo you'll see different colorizations.\n\n781\n00:43:02.550 --> 00:43:03.590\nThat's not a standard thing.\n\n782\n00:43:03.590 --> 00:43:05.600\nYou're not likely to see that on the exam.\n\n783\n00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:08.410\nBut a lot of distributions do that now.\n\n784\n00:43:08.410 --> 00:43:10.443\nSo don't be surprised when\nyou see pretty colors.\n\n785\n00:43:10.443 --> 00:43:12.030\nI like it.\n\n786\n00:43:12.030 --> 00:43:13.270\nIt looks nice.\n[LAUGH]\n\n787\n00:43:13.270 --> 00:43:15.640\n>> Some cool navigation commands there.\n\n788\n00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:17.060\n>> And so these are all important.\n\n789\n00:43:17.060 --> 00:43:20.220\nThese are things that you're gonna use\nevery day as you navigate around a server\n\n790\n00:43:20.220 --> 00:43:23.450\nand make changes and so on.\n\n791\n00:43:23.450 --> 00:43:25.060\nA few other things.\n\n792\n00:43:25.060 --> 00:43:26.550\nWe might wanna make folders.\n\n793\n00:43:26.550 --> 00:43:28.190\nI mentioned that at\nthe beginning of the show.\n\n794\n00:43:28.190 --> 00:43:32.910\nI said what if I wanna have a documents\nfolder, a videos folder, a music folder,\n\n795\n00:43:32.910 --> 00:43:34.210\nand so on?\n\n796\n00:43:34.210 --> 00:43:38.960\nWell, I can jump back into my home\ndirectory, and we've got the various make\n\n797\n00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:43.620\ndirectory and\nremove directory commands to do that.\n\n798\n00:43:43.620 --> 00:43:46.968\nSo md is the make directory command,\nand shoot,\n\n799\n00:43:46.968 --> 00:43:49.999\nit's mkdir is the make directory command.\n\n800\n00:43:49.999 --> 00:43:51.128\n>> Slipped into windows.\n\n801\n00:43:51.128 --> 00:43:52.169\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah I know.\n\n802\n00:43:52.169 --> 00:43:53.001\nDifferent OS's.\n\n803\n00:43:53.001 --> 00:43:55.043\nSo mkdir is make directory.\n\n804\n00:43:55.043 --> 00:44:00.440\nIt's one of the longer commands, and\nthat'll let you create a folder.\n\n805\n00:44:00.440 --> 00:44:03.440\nAnd you can create the folder\nright here in this folder,\n\n806\n00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:06.360\nthe one that I'm in right now,\nmy present working directory, or\n\n807\n00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:10.180\nI can provide a full path to\ncreate it somewhere else.\n\n808\n00:44:10.180 --> 00:44:15.880\nSo if I want a documents folder,\nI can just type mkdir documents.\n\n809\n00:44:15.880 --> 00:44:20.330\nAnd remember, the file name itself is case\nsensitive, so I need to provide that.\n\n810\n00:44:20.330 --> 00:44:23.830\nNow the command name is\ntypically not case sensitive, so\n\n811\n00:44:23.830 --> 00:44:25.890\nyou can mess around with these.\n\n812\n00:44:25.890 --> 00:44:27.980\nI say typically,\ncuz there are some exceptions.\n\n813\n00:44:27.980 --> 00:44:32.160\nBut usually, no,\nit actually is in this case.\n\n814\n00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:35.130\nSo the command is requiring\nme to be case sensitive.\n\n815\n00:44:35.130 --> 00:44:37.730\nSo I'll go ahead and\ncreate Videos, maybe Music.\n\n816\n00:44:37.730 --> 00:44:42.610\nSo these are the folders where I\nwanna start putting all of my stuff.\n\n817\n00:44:42.610 --> 00:44:44.340\nVideos, music, whatever.\n\n818\n00:44:44.340 --> 00:44:48.110\nI want that, so I'm creating these\nfolders to help me keep myself organized.\n\n819\n00:44:49.280 --> 00:44:52.510\nNow, after I create it, maybe I change\nmy mind, and I say you know what?\n\n820\n00:44:52.510 --> 00:44:53.670\nThis is a business machine.\n\n821\n00:44:53.670 --> 00:44:58.790\nI probably don't need music and videos,\nso maybe I want to get rid of those.\n\n822\n00:44:58.790 --> 00:45:03.840\nAnd so if we wanna get rid of them,\nwell, we can remove them using, well,\n\n823\n00:45:03.840 --> 00:45:06.660\nsome systems have the rmdir command.\n\n824\n00:45:06.660 --> 00:45:08.850\nSo we did mkdir to make it.\n\n825\n00:45:08.850 --> 00:45:11.930\nYou have rmdir to remove it.\n\n826\n00:45:11.930 --> 00:45:15.100\nThat's the most common command that\nwe use for removing a directory.\n\n827\n00:45:15.100 --> 00:45:18.270\nYou actually can use\nthe normal remove command,\n\n828\n00:45:18.270 --> 00:45:19.950\nwhich we'll see a little bit later.\n\n829\n00:45:19.950 --> 00:45:22.900\nBut if we're just dealing with\nthe directory, you can type rmdir and\n\n830\n00:45:22.900 --> 00:45:25.760\nthen the directory that you wanna remove.\n\n831\n00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:30.290\nSo if I want to remove Music,\nrmdir Music and then it is gone.\n\n832\n00:45:30.290 --> 00:45:33.040\nAll right, so no more music folder.\n\n833\n00:45:34.060 --> 00:45:37.520\nNow it is case sensitive, so there's that.\n\n834\n00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:40.160\nIt also requires that the folder be empty.\n\n835\n00:45:40.160 --> 00:45:44.180\nRmdir will not work if\nthe folder has something in it.\n\n836\n00:45:44.180 --> 00:45:48.320\nSo for example, if I go into my videos\nfolder, and I make a file in here,\n\n837\n00:45:48.320 --> 00:45:51.250\nso I'll just make a file real quick.\n\n838\n00:45:51.250 --> 00:45:57.480\nSo now there's something\ninside of that video folder.\n\n839\n00:45:57.480 --> 00:46:03.270\nIf I do an rmdir Videos,\nsee how it says failed to remove Videos.\n\n840\n00:46:03.270 --> 00:46:04.250\nDirectory not empty,.\n\n841\n00:46:05.670 --> 00:46:08.440\nThat's a big limitation of rmdir.\n\n842\n00:46:08.440 --> 00:46:12.000\nAnd because of that, to be honest with\nyou, I very rarely use the command.\n\n843\n00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:15.620\nBecause there's almost always something\nin the folder, and if I wanna delete it,\n\n844\n00:46:15.620 --> 00:46:17.990\nI wanna delete the folder and\nthe stuff inside of it.\n\n845\n00:46:17.990 --> 00:46:21.200\nSo we'll see another command later\non that is a little more common.\n\n846\n00:46:21.200 --> 00:46:24.710\nOr you know, I guess we can do it\nright now, which is the rm command.\n\n847\n00:46:26.010 --> 00:46:32.280\nRmdir, that removes directories, but rm,\nthat one's designed to remove files.\n\n848\n00:46:33.460 --> 00:46:38.190\nSo if I go back into my videos directory,\nand I'll just create a couple of files\n\n849\n00:46:38.190 --> 00:46:42.636\nhere, so I'll create video1 and\nvideo2 and video3.\n\n850\n00:46:42.636 --> 00:46:46.913\nSo I'm just gonna create some of\nthese different files right here,\n\n851\n00:46:46.913 --> 00:46:49.950\nso here's the video files I created.\n\n852\n00:46:49.950 --> 00:46:51.820\nNow if I wanna to remove them,\n\n853\n00:46:51.820 --> 00:46:55.720\nif I want to get rid of them,\nI can use the rm command.\n\n854\n00:46:55.720 --> 00:46:59.470\nI can type rm and\nthen the file name that I wanna delete.\n\n855\n00:46:59.470 --> 00:47:03.310\nI'll do rm Video.mp4, okay.\n\n856\n00:47:03.310 --> 00:47:06.550\nAnd, when I do that,\nit's gonna remove that one file.\n\n857\n00:47:07.850 --> 00:47:11.740\nSo if I wanna delete this directory,\nthen, tehn I need to go through and\n\n858\n00:47:11.740 --> 00:47:12.610\nremove all of these files.\n\n859\n00:47:12.610 --> 00:47:13.190\nRight?\n\n860\n00:47:13.190 --> 00:47:15.910\nWell fortunately,\nthe rm command does take wild cards.\n\n861\n00:47:15.910 --> 00:47:21.770\nAnd so we can say rm*, and that'll\ndelete all the files in this folder,\n\n862\n00:47:21.770 --> 00:47:23.330\nso it's just gonna wipe'em all out.\n\n863\n00:47:23.330 --> 00:47:26.020\nAnd so if I do that, and\n\n864\n00:47:26.020 --> 00:47:28.682\nnow I do a directory listing,\nI can see that it's empty.\n\n865\n00:47:28.682 --> 00:47:33.850\nSo rm followed by a file name,\nwill delete one file.\n\n866\n00:47:33.850 --> 00:47:38.850\nRm * will delete all the files in\nyour present working directory.\n\n867\n00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:42.420\nAll right, let's put that back.\n\n868\n00:47:42.420 --> 00:47:46.781\nSo if I put that Videos directory back,\nI never deleted it.\n\n869\n00:47:46.781 --> 00:47:53.136\nActually hang on, now that it's empty,\nI should be able to do rmdir Videos.\n\n870\n00:47:53.136 --> 00:47:56.244\nAnd now it succeeds,\nnow it removes it, okay?\n\n871\n00:47:56.244 --> 00:47:57.810\nBut let's say I didn't\nwanna go through all that.\n\n872\n00:47:57.810 --> 00:48:00.380\nI didn't wanna have to go through deleting\nthe files and then deleting the directory.\n\n873\n00:48:00.380 --> 00:48:03.430\nI wanted to do it all in one step,\nall right?\n\n874\n00:48:03.430 --> 00:48:06.756\nSo I'm gonna go back into Videos here,\nand I'll just recreate those files.\n\n875\n00:48:11.951 --> 00:48:16.268\nAll right, and, so now I'm back to where,\nif I tried to remove the directory,\n\n876\n00:48:16.268 --> 00:48:19.865\nit's gonna fail,\ncuz it's not empty, all right.\n\n877\n00:48:19.865 --> 00:48:23.630\nIf I wanna knock it all\nout in one fell swoop,\n\n878\n00:48:23.630 --> 00:48:27.010\nwe can use some of the command\nline modifiers in the rm command.\n\n879\n00:48:27.010 --> 00:48:30.240\nThe rm command will actually\nwork on a directory.\n\n880\n00:48:30.240 --> 00:48:34.160\nYou can run rm Videos and it will try and\nremove the directory, all right.\n\n881\n00:48:34.160 --> 00:48:36.927\nBut what it won't do, is it won't try to\nremove the things inside of it and so\n\n882\n00:48:36.927 --> 00:48:37.634\nit's gonna fail.\n\n883\n00:48:37.634 --> 00:48:41.110\nThat's effectively what rmdir is doing,\nall right?\n\n884\n00:48:41.110 --> 00:48:42.750\nBut we can provide\na command line modifier.\n\n885\n00:48:42.750 --> 00:48:46.572\nIt actually goes back to\nMikhail's joke in the chatroom,\n\n886\n00:48:46.572 --> 00:48:50.872\nis he showed the rm command there\nwith the -rf modifiers, okay?\n\n887\n00:48:50.872 --> 00:48:58.200\nThe -r saying be recursive, don't just get\nthe folder, get the stuff inside of it.\n\n888\n00:48:58.200 --> 00:49:01.670\nFollow the folders down the tree and\nwipe out everything inside of it.\n\n889\n00:49:01.670 --> 00:49:04.660\nAnd then f, which is we're\nspecifying the files to remove.\n\n890\n00:49:04.660 --> 00:49:09.347\nSo if we modify this a little bit and\n\n891\n00:49:09.347 --> 00:49:13.882\nsaid rm-rf./Videos, okay.\n\n892\n00:49:13.882 --> 00:49:15.477\nWhat that says is,\n\n893\n00:49:15.477 --> 00:49:21.278\nremove recursively a file called\nVideos that's in this directory.\n\n894\n00:49:21.278 --> 00:49:27.640\nRight, so ./ look in the current\ndirectory, /Videos, find that folder or\n\n895\n00:49:27.640 --> 00:49:30.080\nfile, it doesn't necessarily\nknow what it is and this point.\n\n896\n00:49:30.080 --> 00:49:32.600\nAnd we wanna remove it and\nwe wanna do it recursively.\n\n897\n00:49:32.600 --> 00:49:35.470\nSo if there's anything inside of it,\nwipe it out.\n\n898\n00:49:35.470 --> 00:49:37.160\nOkay, get that out of there.\n\n899\n00:49:37.160 --> 00:49:39.890\nAnd so when we run that,\nit's gonna remove it.\n\n900\n00:49:39.890 --> 00:49:41.750\nIt didn't complain.\n\n901\n00:49:41.750 --> 00:49:43.660\nIt deleted the files in the folder,\n\n902\n00:49:43.660 --> 00:49:46.700\nas well as the folder itself,\nall in one swoop.\n\n903\n00:49:46.700 --> 00:49:50.720\nSo rmdir is great if the folder is empty.\n\n904\n00:49:50.720 --> 00:49:54.160\nBut if the folder has stuff inside of it,\nwe're normally just going to use the rm\n\n905\n00:49:54.160 --> 00:49:57.400\ncommand, rm which is normally designed for\nfiles.\n\n906\n00:49:57.400 --> 00:50:02.080\nWhen we do -r it makes it recursive,\nand that works great on folders too.\n\n907\n00:50:02.080 --> 00:50:02.870\nAll right, so\n\n908\n00:50:02.870 --> 00:50:06.990\ngreat example there of a command line\nmodifier that we can use for a command.\n\n909\n00:50:06.990 --> 00:50:10.858\nSo rm that's just short for\nremove and we remove that data.\n\n910\n00:50:10.858 --> 00:50:14.187\nSo for those of you watching who recorded\nMikhaill's joke, I'll show the command but\n\n911\n00:50:14.187 --> 00:50:14.834\nI won't run it.\n\n912\n00:50:14.834 --> 00:50:19.844\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Was rm -rf/, okay?\n\n913\n00:50:19.844 --> 00:50:22.982\nSo what is that command gonna do?\n\n914\n00:50:22.982 --> 00:50:26.650\nIt's gonna look at the root folder\\, and\n\n915\n00:50:26.650 --> 00:50:30.000\nthen it's gonna remove recursively\neverything inside of it.\n\n916\n00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:32.350\nIt's gonna delete every\nfile on your drive.\n\n917\n00:50:32.350 --> 00:50:34.100\nNow, some of your files are locked and\n\n918\n00:50:34.100 --> 00:50:38.200\nwon't be able to be removed, but\na lot of files will get removed.\n\n919\n00:50:38.200 --> 00:50:40.410\nI'm logged in as a regular user,\nso it really won't do much damage.\n\n920\n00:50:40.410 --> 00:50:44.926\nIt will mess with my home directory,\nright, but if I was logged in as root,\n\n921\n00:50:44.926 --> 00:50:47.700\nit would wipe out a huge chunk of my data.\n\n922\n00:50:47.700 --> 00:50:50.060\nIt would basically shut your system down.\n\n923\n00:50:50.060 --> 00:50:51.748\nSo, you definitely wouldn't want that.\n\n924\n00:50:51.748 --> 00:50:55.860\nIt's not somewhere you want to be,\nall right.\n\n925\n00:50:55.860 --> 00:50:59.260\nFor hitting individual directories though,\nlike I did, I was very specific.\n\n926\n00:50:59.260 --> 00:51:02.690\nI said in this directory,\nfind a folder called Videos, right?\n\n927\n00:51:02.690 --> 00:51:05.807\nBeing specific like that makes sure that\nyou control the scope of the command and\n\n928\n00:51:05.807 --> 00:51:07.306\nkeeps you out of trouble, all right?\n\n929\n00:51:07.306 --> 00:51:11.700\nNow, I probably could have abbreviated\nthat down and not done the ./.\n\n930\n00:51:11.700 --> 00:51:15.420\nBut I just make a habit of that,\nbecause I don't like risk.\n\n931\n00:51:15.420 --> 00:51:18.160\nI don't like that chance that I could\naccidentally delete something in\n\n932\n00:51:18.160 --> 00:51:19.400\na different directory.\n\n933\n00:51:19.400 --> 00:51:23.404\nSo I usually do the ./ to force it,\nso it knows,\n\n934\n00:51:23.404 --> 00:51:26.741\nhey it's in this directory right here.\n\n935\n00:51:26.741 --> 00:51:29.098\nAll right, so\nwe've seen how to make directories, and\n\n936\n00:51:29.098 --> 00:51:30.616\nnow we've seen how to remove them.\n\n937\n00:51:30.616 --> 00:51:33.181\nAnd we've seen how to remove other files,\nso\n\n938\n00:51:33.181 --> 00:51:37.515\nwe've kinda gotten our feet wet with\na few different things that are there.\n\n939\n00:51:37.515 --> 00:51:41.340\nOne thing we haven't seen though,\nis how to create files.\n\n940\n00:51:41.340 --> 00:51:44.965\nAnd I use the touch command to create\nsome files during the show, but\n\n941\n00:51:44.965 --> 00:51:45.989\nthat's not real.\n\n942\n00:51:45.989 --> 00:51:48.470\nThere's nothing inside of them.\n\n943\n00:51:48.470 --> 00:51:52.360\nSo the next thing that I want to show\nyou guys is how we can actually put data\n\n944\n00:51:52.360 --> 00:51:53.660\ninto those files.\n\n945\n00:51:53.660 --> 00:51:55.530\nAnd then that's\nan important thing to know.\n\n946\n00:51:55.530 --> 00:51:58.740\nYou know there's a few other\nthings I want to talk about, too,\n\n947\n00:51:58.740 --> 00:52:00.260\nsome of the little command line shortcuts.\n\n948\n00:52:00.260 --> 00:52:01.130\nWell, we'll get to those, too.\n\n949\n00:52:01.130 --> 00:52:02.420\nWe've got plenty of time.\n\n950\n00:52:02.420 --> 00:52:05.490\nAll right, so why don't we stop here and\ntake a break.\n\n951\n00:52:05.490 --> 00:52:10.010\nAnd when we get back, I wanna show\nyou guys how to put data into a file.\n\n952\n00:52:10.010 --> 00:52:12.740\nAnd actually have it be useful and\nmeaningful.\n\n953\n00:52:12.740 --> 00:52:13.410\n>> Sounds good.\n\n954\n00:52:13.410 --> 00:52:19.912\n>> All right, stay tuned,\nwe'll be back in a few.\n\n955\n00:52:19.912 --> 00:52:24.356\n[SOUND] All right, so\nin one of the earlier episodes,\n\n956\n00:52:24.356 --> 00:52:30.322\nI mentioned how most Linux distributions\nhave various text editors.\n\n957\n00:52:30.322 --> 00:52:33.290\nAnd we'll use those frequently\nas we configure our server.\n\n958\n00:52:33.290 --> 00:52:35.210\nI think I was configuring\nthe network adaptor for\n\n959\n00:52:35.210 --> 00:52:37.110\nour CentOS installer or something.\n\n960\n00:52:37.110 --> 00:52:41.220\nAnd there are a wide selection\nof text editors out there.\n\n961\n00:52:41.220 --> 00:52:46.450\nSome are very basic, some are very fancy,\nsome are extremely easy to use,\n\n962\n00:52:46.450 --> 00:52:51.440\nsome are non-intuitive, but\nat the end of the day, they may or\n\n963\n00:52:51.440 --> 00:52:54.260\nmay not be there in your distribution.\n\n964\n00:52:54.260 --> 00:52:58.030\nAnd I mentioned how using the vi, V-I,\n\n965\n00:52:58.030 --> 00:53:02.010\nthe vi file editor,\nit really is your best bet.\n\n966\n00:53:02.010 --> 00:53:03.120\nIt's not very intuitive,\n\n967\n00:53:03.120 --> 00:53:07.910\nit's not very easy to use even, but it's\nthe only that is pretty much a guarantee\n\n968\n00:53:07.910 --> 00:53:11.830\nto be there on any Unix based\noperating system that's out there.\n\n969\n00:53:11.830 --> 00:53:15.008\nSo I encourage you guys to learn vi and\nget used to it,\n\n970\n00:53:15.008 --> 00:53:17.407\njust cuz you know it's gonna be there.\n\n971\n00:53:17.407 --> 00:53:19.004\n>> Universal.\n>> If you learn Nano, there's so\n\n972\n00:53:19.004 --> 00:53:22.400\nmany people that learn Nano now and\nthey're like, that's the one I wanna use.\n\n973\n00:53:22.400 --> 00:53:25.390\nBut then they go and do a basic install\nof CentOS and it's not there, or\n\n974\n00:53:25.390 --> 00:53:27.660\nthen they jump over to Debian and\nit's not there.\n\n975\n00:53:27.660 --> 00:53:30.550\nAnd so, learning vi is\ndefinitely something useful.\n\n976\n00:53:30.550 --> 00:53:35.390\nSo I wanna take a look at the vi Editor,\nshow you how it works, how to use it, and\n\n977\n00:53:35.390 --> 00:53:38.080\nshow you some of the basic\ncommands to be able to get by.\n\n978\n00:53:38.080 --> 00:53:42.770\nThere are hundreds of keyboard\nshortcuts that work inside of vi.\n\n979\n00:53:42.770 --> 00:53:45.620\nThere's really only about ten\nthat you need to know, and\n\n980\n00:53:45.620 --> 00:53:49.740\nif you know them, if gives you\nthe basic ability to modify files, and\n\n981\n00:53:49.740 --> 00:53:55.000\nthat's enough to serve us as\nan administrator of a Linux system, so.\n\n982\n00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:56.062\nSo let's take a look at that.\n\n983\n00:53:56.062 --> 00:53:59.150\nI'm gonna take a look at some\nof these files that I made.\n\n984\n00:53:59.150 --> 00:54:03.465\nSo here in my home directory, so\nI'm still in /home/dpezet, and\n\n985\n00:54:03.465 --> 00:54:06.520\nthere's that ReadMe.txt file.\n\n986\n00:54:06.520 --> 00:54:09.580\nLet's say I actually wanna\nput something in there,\n\n987\n00:54:09.580 --> 00:54:15.200\nor maybe I wanna make an HTML file,\nmaybe I wanna make a webpage.\n\n988\n00:54:15.200 --> 00:54:16.810\nIf I wanna create a new file,\n\n989\n00:54:16.810 --> 00:54:21.200\na file that doesn't exist, I could use\nthe touch command to create it first.\n\n990\n00:54:21.200 --> 00:54:25.350\nBut if I use a text editor, like vi,\nit'll create the file for me, too.\n\n991\n00:54:25.350 --> 00:54:27.910\nSo vi, it's just vi is the command.\n\n992\n00:54:27.910 --> 00:54:30.570\nAnd if you were to run it by itself,\nit would create an empty file.\n\n993\n00:54:30.570 --> 00:54:33.010\nBut normally we provide\nit with a file name.\n\n994\n00:54:33.010 --> 00:54:37.900\nAnd so I'm gonna say vi and I'll create,\nand maybe I'm writing an HTML file so\n\n995\n00:54:37.900 --> 00:54:41.122\nI'll say index.html.\n\n996\n00:54:41.122 --> 00:54:45.210\nSo ./, I'm just telling it I wanna create\nthis file in my current directory.\n\n997\n00:54:45.210 --> 00:54:48.780\nIt's usually optional, but again I'm just\nin the habit of providing it cuz I wanna\n\n998\n00:54:48.780 --> 00:54:50.279\nknow where this file is going.\n\n999\n00:54:51.730 --> 00:54:55.877\nAnd now, I'm in the vi Editor.\n\n1000\n00:54:55.877 --> 00:54:58.850\nNow, you might think to yourself okay,\nI'm just gonna start typing and\n\n1001\n00:54:58.850 --> 00:54:59.738\nget to work, right?\n\n1002\n00:54:59.738 --> 00:55:02.950\nBut if you start typing,\nweird things will start happening.\n\n1003\n00:55:02.950 --> 00:55:04.718\nAll sorts of crazy things will\nshow up on the screen and\n\n1004\n00:55:04.718 --> 00:55:06.670\nit doesn't make a whole lot of sense.\n\n1005\n00:55:06.670 --> 00:55:11.472\nAnd that's because when you launch the vi\nEditor, you're not in insert mode.\n\n1006\n00:55:11.472 --> 00:55:13.098\nIn other words, you're not ready to type.\n\n1007\n00:55:13.098 --> 00:55:14.890\nYou're in what's called command mode.\n\n1008\n00:55:14.890 --> 00:55:17.220\nThere's two different modes for\nthis editor.\n\n1009\n00:55:17.220 --> 00:55:20.840\nCommand mode is where you have shortcuts\nyou can apply that take certain actions,\n\n1010\n00:55:20.840 --> 00:55:22.030\nand if you just start typing,\n\n1011\n00:55:22.030 --> 00:55:25.275\nyou're actually triggering some\nof those those command shortcuts.\n\n1012\n00:55:26.600 --> 00:55:28.730\nBut insert mode,\nthat's where you're typing and\n\n1013\n00:55:28.730 --> 00:55:30.630\nit shows up on the screen, all right?\n\n1014\n00:55:30.630 --> 00:55:34.420\nNow when you're in here,\nif there's a line that you can type on,\n\n1015\n00:55:34.420 --> 00:55:37.230\nyou'll see your cursor,\nnow I've got it at the top left.\n\n1016\n00:55:37.230 --> 00:55:40.720\nAnd if there's a line that's not actually\npresent, you'll see a little tilde symbol,\n\n1017\n00:55:40.720 --> 00:55:43.880\nso that's why we have the blue tildes\nrunning down the left side of the screen.\n\n1018\n00:55:43.880 --> 00:55:47.573\nThose are just indicating that\nthose aren't actually lines,\n\n1019\n00:55:47.573 --> 00:55:49.811\nI'm at the end of my file, all right.\n\n1020\n00:55:49.811 --> 00:55:53.047\nIf I wanna start typing,\nif it's just a new blank file and\n\n1021\n00:55:53.047 --> 00:55:54.540\nI'm ready to get to work.\n\n1022\n00:55:54.540 --> 00:55:58.087\nThen what I need to do,\nis I need to type the letter i.\n\n1023\n00:55:58.087 --> 00:56:03.050\nThe letter i is the shortcut that's\ngonna move me into insert mode.\n\n1024\n00:56:03.050 --> 00:56:07.373\nAnd now I can start typing and\nso if I've got\n\n1025\n00:56:07.373 --> 00:56:11.800\na web page that I wanna type,\nI can come in here and I can start typing.\n\n1026\n00:56:11.800 --> 00:56:16.720\nNow, in CentOS,\nthe basic vi that's installed is actually\n\n1027\n00:56:16.720 --> 00:56:21.590\nlinked to a more advanced version of vi\ncalled vim, and it does colorization.\n\n1028\n00:56:21.590 --> 00:56:24.540\nSee how it's colorizing my HTML tags.\n\n1029\n00:56:24.540 --> 00:56:25.860\nYou're not always gonna have that.\n\n1030\n00:56:25.860 --> 00:56:29.310\nIn fact, on vi on most systems,\nit's just black and white.\n\n1031\n00:56:29.310 --> 00:56:31.690\nBut, if you're just writing a text file,\nyou don't care about it.\n\n1032\n00:56:31.690 --> 00:56:35.260\nIf you're writing a website, then it is\nkinda useful to have some of these tags,\n\n1033\n00:56:35.260 --> 00:56:40.800\nand you can come in here, and, oops,\nand represent, like this is my webpage.\n\n1034\n00:56:40.800 --> 00:56:42.100\nWoohoo!\n\n1035\n00:56:42.100 --> 00:56:43.254\nGotta do exclamation points.\n\n1036\n00:56:52.913 --> 00:56:55.417\nAnd so I'm just writing the page,\nI'm capitalizing my tags,\n\n1037\n00:56:55.417 --> 00:56:56.321\nI don't have to do it.\n\n1038\n00:56:56.321 --> 00:56:57.291\nI don't know why I'm doing that.\n\n1039\n00:56:57.291 --> 00:56:59.912\nBut it certainly doesn't hurt it.\n\n1040\n00:57:02.836 --> 00:57:03.680\nAnd there we go.\n\n1041\n00:57:03.680 --> 00:57:07.630\nSo I'm just typing, pressing Enter after\neach line, and kind of moving through and\n\n1042\n00:57:07.630 --> 00:57:08.880\nwriting this file.\n\n1043\n00:57:08.880 --> 00:57:11.370\nIt's colorizing it for me,\nwhich is nice, but not necessary.\n\n1044\n00:57:13.170 --> 00:57:15.610\nNow, right now I'm in typing mode.\n\n1045\n00:57:15.610 --> 00:57:19.570\nAnd so I can go in and I can insert\nmy text, I can type whatever I want,\n\n1046\n00:57:19.570 --> 00:57:23.380\nI can move around with my arrow keys,\nand I can come in here and\n\n1047\n00:57:23.380 --> 00:57:26.710\nI can type in and insert whatever I want,\nbecause I'm in insert mode.\n\n1048\n00:57:28.900 --> 00:57:32.850\nWhen I'm ready to save the file, when I'm\nready to save it to the hard drive and\n\n1049\n00:57:32.850 --> 00:57:36.900\ncommit my changes,\nI need to get out of insert mode.\n\n1050\n00:57:36.900 --> 00:57:40.490\nSo I press the i key,\nto get into insert mode.\n\n1051\n00:57:40.490 --> 00:57:44.830\nIf I press Escape,\nthat's gonna take me back to command mode.\n\n1052\n00:57:44.830 --> 00:57:47.460\nAnd at the bottom left,\nthere's that word insert.\n\n1053\n00:57:47.460 --> 00:57:49.180\nSee how it says insert right now?\n\n1054\n00:57:49.180 --> 00:57:54.610\nWhen you hit Escape, the word insert goes\naway, and now, anything that I type, is\n\n1055\n00:57:54.610 --> 00:57:59.590\nactually going to be a shortcut, a command\nshortcut, and there's a bunch of them.\n\n1056\n00:57:59.590 --> 00:58:01.390\nAnd it kinda depends on\nwhat you're wanting to do,\n\n1057\n00:58:01.390 --> 00:58:02.690\nthat is gonna control the shortcut.\n\n1058\n00:58:04.090 --> 00:58:07.180\nMost of the shortcuts have to\ndeal with the file itself.\n\n1059\n00:58:07.180 --> 00:58:11.713\nChanging the text that's on screen, but\nthere's some that deal with stuff outside\n\n1060\n00:58:11.713 --> 00:58:16.160\nof the editor, like, I created this file,\nI probably need to save it.\n\n1061\n00:58:16.160 --> 00:58:21.100\nIf I want to save my file, that's a file\noperation, a command line operation.\n\n1062\n00:58:21.100 --> 00:58:24.250\nSo I actually need to go\nin to another special mode.\n\n1063\n00:58:24.250 --> 00:58:25.490\nI know I saw that in command mode,\n\n1064\n00:58:25.490 --> 00:58:29.790\nthere's actually a kind of a third mode\nwhich is just file system commands.\n\n1065\n00:58:29.790 --> 00:58:32.110\nAnd so if you type in a colon.\n\n1066\n00:58:33.600 --> 00:58:37.110\nNotice how the colon actually appeared for\nme down there at the bottom left, and\n\n1067\n00:58:37.110 --> 00:58:40.180\nit's saying now I'm waiting for\nyou to give me additional commands.\n\n1068\n00:58:41.490 --> 00:58:43.100\nAnd so I'm gonna type just w.\n\n1069\n00:58:44.310 --> 00:58:48.620\nW says to save what I've done on screen,\nokay?\n\n1070\n00:58:48.620 --> 00:58:51.460\nSo when I type that w, it saves it,\nand I get a message right there,\n\n1071\n00:58:51.460 --> 00:58:54.520\ntelling me it created a new file\ncuz this file didn't exist.\n\n1072\n00:58:54.520 --> 00:58:57.470\nAnd it wrote it, it's written,\nand now we're in business.\n\n1073\n00:58:59.680 --> 00:59:03.878\nIf I was actually done and\nready to get out of this file,\n\n1074\n00:59:03.878 --> 00:59:08.736\nI could type :q, and that would quit and\nget me out of the file.\n\n1075\n00:59:08.736 --> 00:59:10.640\nAnd see, now I'm back at my prompt.\n\n1076\n00:59:10.640 --> 00:59:13.460\nSo, :w, that will save the file.\n\n1077\n00:59:13.460 --> 00:59:15.710\nIt writes it to the hard drive.\n\n1078\n00:59:15.710 --> 00:59:18.470\nAnd :q will quit.\n\n1079\n00:59:18.470 --> 00:59:21.116\nAnd just like command line extensions,\nyou can combine these.\n\n1080\n00:59:21.116 --> 00:59:27.291\nIf I get back into my files, so\nI'm gonna say vi ./index.html.\n\n1081\n00:59:27.291 --> 00:59:30.890\nAll right, so here I am back inside of it.\n\n1082\n00:59:30.890 --> 00:59:36.620\nI could have done a :wq, and\nthat will write and quit.\n\n1083\n00:59:36.620 --> 00:59:39.430\nIt'll do both, so\nit'll save and get me out.\n\n1084\n00:59:39.430 --> 00:59:42.861\nSo if I'm just going in here\nto make some quick changes,\n\n1085\n00:59:42.861 --> 00:59:47.679\nwhat my normal pattern will be, is I will\ngo in, I'll hit i to do my insert, and\n\n1086\n00:59:47.679 --> 00:59:50.026\nI'll go in and I'll make my changes.\n\n1087\n00:59:50.026 --> 00:59:54.901\nSo I'll insert whatever text it is I\nwanted to add, so maybe I need another\n\n1088\n00:59:54.901 --> 01:00:00.092\nparagraph here, or I just wanna add some,\nmaybe I wanna do some hard returns,\n\n1089\n01:00:00.092 --> 01:00:05.155\nand so I'll just add these in here to\nmake my page look exceptionally silly.\n\n1090\n01:00:05.155 --> 01:00:08.303\nSo I've just made my changes, and\n\n1091\n01:00:08.303 --> 01:00:13.852\nthen I can do Escape to get out\nof insert mode, and then :wq.\n\n1092\n01:00:13.852 --> 01:00:15.980\nWrite the changes and quit.\n\n1093\n01:00:17.820 --> 01:00:21.690\nAll right, so there it tells me it wrote\nit, and it quits, and now I'm out.\n\n1094\n01:00:23.390 --> 01:00:28.440\nSo to get by in vi, there's really\njust a few commands we need to know.\n\n1095\n01:00:28.440 --> 01:00:30.720\nSo vi itself, V-I, right?\n\n1096\n01:00:30.720 --> 01:00:33.460\nThat followed by a file\nname will edit the file.\n\n1097\n01:00:33.460 --> 01:00:36.390\nThe letter i to get into insert mode, and\n\n1098\n01:00:36.390 --> 01:00:40.840\nso now I can start inserting text, and\nthen Escape to get out of insert mode.\n\n1099\n01:00:41.858 --> 01:00:47.420\nFollowed by :wq to save the file and\nquit out of the editor.\n\n1100\n01:00:47.420 --> 01:00:50.020\nFor most people,\nthat's all they need to know.\n\n1101\n01:00:51.170 --> 01:00:54.690\nThat's enough to get by in vi and\nwork with it.\n\n1102\n01:00:54.690 --> 01:00:57.280\nSo when you first install a server or\nwhatever,\n\n1103\n01:00:57.280 --> 01:01:00.130\nyou might need to edit\nsome configuration files.\n\n1104\n01:01:00.130 --> 01:01:04.990\nYou might need to move some things around\nor whatever, and vi can do it for you.\n\n1105\n01:01:04.990 --> 01:01:07.720\nYou get in there,\nyou edit the text, save, and close.\n\n1106\n01:01:08.900 --> 01:01:10.810\nSo you could stop right there.\n\n1107\n01:01:10.810 --> 01:01:14.685\nBut for completeness, I do wanna show a\nfew other things we can do inside it that\n\n1108\n01:01:14.685 --> 01:01:16.170\nare a little bit time saving.\n\n1109\n01:01:17.860 --> 01:01:21.060\nFor example, what if I get into a file.\n\n1110\n01:01:21.060 --> 01:01:23.290\nSo I'm gonna get in\nhere to edit this file.\n\n1111\n01:01:23.290 --> 01:01:25.440\nAll right, here I am,\nI'm editing the file, and\n\n1112\n01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:29.980\nI start making some changes,\nand you know, I hate HTML.\n\n1113\n01:01:29.980 --> 01:01:33.580\nAnd see how I screwed up my tag,\nI inserted it in the wrong place.\n\n1114\n01:01:33.580 --> 01:01:36.140\nAnd if you've messed it up enough,\nyou might say to yourself,\n\n1115\n01:01:36.140 --> 01:01:38.640\nyou know what, I just wanna get\nout of this thing and not save.\n\n1116\n01:01:40.110 --> 01:01:43.070\nWell if you hit Escape,\nand do a colon, and\n\n1117\n01:01:43.070 --> 01:01:46.530\na q, and just try and\nquit out, it's gonna stop you.\n\n1118\n01:01:46.530 --> 01:01:50.040\nSee how it says no write\nsince last change.\n\n1119\n01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:52.460\nIt won't let you quit,\nbecause you've made changes.\n\n1120\n01:01:52.460 --> 01:01:58.270\nBut if you wanna abandon your changes, it\nsays add an exclamation point to override.\n\n1121\n01:01:58.270 --> 01:02:03.090\nSo all you have to do is type :q!\n\n1122\n01:02:03.090 --> 01:02:05.620\nThat means quit and don't save.\n\n1123\n01:02:05.620 --> 01:02:09.950\nDon't save the changes, just throw them\nout, I messed it up, I don't want it.\n\n1124\n01:02:09.950 --> 01:02:12.795\nAnd there you go, you quit without saving.\n\n1125\n01:02:12.795 --> 01:02:15.385\nI make a habit of doing that if I\never edit a file to look at it and\n\n1126\n01:02:15.385 --> 01:02:19.085\nI don't make any changes, sometimes\nyou can accidentally make a change.\n\n1127\n01:02:19.085 --> 01:02:22.085\nAnd so I'll use q exclamation\npoint to get out without saving,\n\n1128\n01:02:22.085 --> 01:02:23.725\njust to be on the safe side.\n\n1129\n01:02:23.725 --> 01:02:26.155\nEven though I think I\ndidn't make any changes,\n\n1130\n01:02:26.155 --> 01:02:27.401\nthat will make sure that\nI don't save anything.\n\n1131\n01:02:27.401 --> 01:02:31.680\nAll right,\n\n1132\n01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:36.530\nfew other things that we might want,\nlittle time saving things.\n\n1133\n01:02:36.530 --> 01:02:41.551\nIf we're editing a really big file,\nif this file has thousands of lines in it,\n\n1134\n01:02:41.551 --> 01:02:44.303\nand some of your configuration files may.\n\n1135\n01:02:44.303 --> 01:02:46.451\nYou might have a config file,\nlike a patchy config file.\n\n1136\n01:02:46.451 --> 01:02:47.970\nThey can get really big.\n\n1137\n01:02:47.970 --> 01:02:50.460\nAnd you're looking for a specific line,\n\n1138\n01:02:50.460 --> 01:02:52.250\nyou're trying to find\nsomething in particular.\n\n1139\n01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:58.093\nWhen you're in command mode, not in insert\nmode, but when you're in command mode,\n\n1140\n01:02:58.093 --> 01:02:59.688\nyou can type a forward slash.\n\n1141\n01:02:59.688 --> 01:03:06.060\nAnd that forward slash Is basically going\nto say, I wanna search for something.\n\n1142\n01:03:06.060 --> 01:03:08.850\nSo you type a forward slash, and\nthen whatever it is you're searching for.\n\n1143\n01:03:08.850 --> 01:03:11.770\nSo I want to search for\nthe word, visiting.\n\n1144\n01:03:11.770 --> 01:03:14.200\nSo I'm gonna type /visiting.\n\n1145\n01:03:14.200 --> 01:03:17.500\nAnd it's going to do\na forward scan searching for\n\n1146\n01:03:17.500 --> 01:03:19.550\nthe word visiting, all right?\n\n1147\n01:03:19.550 --> 01:03:23.040\nIt's case sensitive, and\nit's going to scan to try and find it.\n\n1148\n01:03:23.040 --> 01:03:24.760\nAnd hopefully it finds it, there it is.\n\n1149\n01:03:24.760 --> 01:03:28.450\nSo it just jumped forward in\nthe file to find that instance.\n\n1150\n01:03:28.450 --> 01:03:33.523\nIf that's not the one that I wanted,\nyou can just do /visiting again,\n\n1151\n01:03:33.523 --> 01:03:35.670\nand it'll repeat it and do the search.\n\n1152\n01:03:35.670 --> 01:03:38.270\nAnd I can see mine hit the bottom,\nand there we go.\n\n1153\n01:03:38.270 --> 01:03:41.800\nAnd actually on a lot of systems, you\ncan just type slash and press enter, and\n\n1154\n01:03:41.800 --> 01:03:44.318\nit'll repeat the same search\nthat it did a moment ago.\n\n1155\n01:03:44.318 --> 01:03:46.780\nSo, that's a little bit of a short cut.\n\n1156\n01:03:46.780 --> 01:03:49.832\nIt finds the first one and\nyou just do slash Enter, slash Enter,\n\n1157\n01:03:49.832 --> 01:03:51.821\nand it keeps jumping to find the next one.\n\n1158\n01:03:51.821 --> 01:03:56.194\nSo for example,\nif I did a search for body.\n\n1159\n01:03:56.194 --> 01:04:00.370\nOkay, it finds the first one and\nthen I can do just slash Enter.\n\n1160\n01:04:00.370 --> 01:04:01.564\nAnd it finds the second one.\n\n1161\n01:04:01.564 --> 01:04:05.190\nSo it just jumped down, and\nit took me to the second instance.\n\n1162\n01:04:06.270 --> 01:04:09.630\nSo that slash, quick way to search and\nfind something.\n\n1163\n01:04:09.630 --> 01:04:12.770\nAnd you find it and\nthen you hit your Insert key, and\n\n1164\n01:04:12.770 --> 01:04:15.480\nnow you're ready to start making\nthe change to whatever that tag is.\n\n1165\n01:04:16.590 --> 01:04:18.371\nSo that's another shortcut\nthat's pretty handy.\n\n1166\n01:04:18.371 --> 01:04:20.690\nJust a forward slash\ninitiates that search.\n\n1167\n01:04:23.080 --> 01:04:26.650\nSome of the other ones, Insert mode.\n\n1168\n01:04:26.650 --> 01:04:32.530\nWhen you move your cursor to align and\nyou just hit the I key,\n\n1169\n01:04:32.530 --> 01:04:38.950\nwhen you go into insert mode, it starts\ninserting wherever your cursor was.\n\n1170\n01:04:38.950 --> 01:04:44.289\nSo I had my cursor on the m in my and\nI hit just the I key.\n\n1171\n01:04:44.289 --> 01:04:46.360\nAnd now when I start typing there it is.\n\n1172\n01:04:47.830 --> 01:04:49.990\nThere's some variations of that.\n\n1173\n01:04:49.990 --> 01:04:51.885\nBack in command mode, if I do a capital I.\n\n1174\n01:04:51.885 --> 01:04:57.110\nSo I did a lower case i, lower case i says\ninsert wherever my cursor is right now.\n\n1175\n01:04:57.110 --> 01:05:03.360\nIf you do a capital I, that means\ninsert at the beginning of the line.\n\n1176\n01:05:03.360 --> 01:05:05.210\nAnd so you'll see,\nI did a capital I that time.\n\n1177\n01:05:05.210 --> 01:05:09.162\nIt jumped to the beginning of the line,\neven though the cursor was on the m in my.\n\n1178\n01:05:09.162 --> 01:05:12.480\nSo insert from the beginning\nby doing a capital.\n\n1179\n01:05:12.480 --> 01:05:16.670\nI don't normally do that, but\nthere's some uses for that.\n\n1180\n01:05:18.670 --> 01:05:21.400\nWe also might wanna do this\nat the end of the line.\n\n1181\n01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:26.920\nWhen I do a lower case i, it inserts\nbefore my current cursor position.\n\n1182\n01:05:26.920 --> 01:05:31.160\nIf you do a lower case a,\nit's actually append and\n\n1183\n01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:34.700\nit will insert after your\ncurrent cursor position.\n\n1184\n01:05:34.700 --> 01:05:39.800\nNow, I don't use that one very often,\nbut one that I do use is a capital A.\n\n1185\n01:05:39.800 --> 01:05:43.570\nCapital A's append at the end\nof the current line, and so\n\n1186\n01:05:43.570 --> 01:05:47.120\nnow it jumps to the end of the line.\n\n1187\n01:05:47.120 --> 01:05:48.690\nSo if you wanna add something\nto the end of that line,\n\n1188\n01:05:48.690 --> 01:05:49.998\na capital A will jump you there.\n\n1189\n01:05:49.998 --> 01:05:52.920\nSo lower case i,\n\n1190\n01:05:52.920 --> 01:05:58.100\ninsert before my cursor, lower case a,\ninsert after my current cursor.\n\n1191\n01:05:58.100 --> 01:06:01.550\nCapital I, insert at the beginning\nof the line, capital A,\n\n1192\n01:06:01.550 --> 01:06:02.630\ninsert at the end of the line.\n\n1193\n01:06:02.630 --> 01:06:06.287\nSo just kind of adjusting where you're\nactually going to be inserting text.\n\n1194\n01:06:10.620 --> 01:06:12.662\n>> Nice.\n\n1195\n01:06:12.662 --> 01:06:14.790\n>> Some other commands for us.\n\n1196\n01:06:14.790 --> 01:06:18.490\nIf you wanna delete an entire line,\nyou could go into insert mode.\n\n1197\n01:06:18.490 --> 01:06:21.350\nMove to the end of the line and\nthen hold your backspace key down, and\n\n1198\n01:06:21.350 --> 01:06:24.120\ndelete it that way or\n\n1199\n01:06:24.120 --> 01:06:28.930\nyou can move your cursor above a line and\nthere's actually two shortcuts here.\n\n1200\n01:06:28.930 --> 01:06:31.940\nYou can press the D character twice.\n\n1201\n01:06:31.940 --> 01:06:34.350\nIt's kind of a little safety mechanism.\n\n1202\n01:06:34.350 --> 01:06:36.560\nSo if I decide,\nI don't want this thank you line anymore,\n\n1203\n01:06:36.560 --> 01:06:39.420\nI can move my cursor to that line,\nanywhere on it'll do.\n\n1204\n01:06:39.420 --> 01:06:45.130\nAnd I can type dd and when you do dd,\nit deletes the line, okay?\n\n1205\n01:06:45.130 --> 01:06:48.410\nThere's actually a command mode switch for\nthat also.\n\n1206\n01:06:48.410 --> 01:06:52.350\nYou could highlight it and type :d,\nand it does the same thing.\n\n1207\n01:06:53.410 --> 01:06:56.960\nSo dd or :d,\nit's the same amount of characters,\n\n1208\n01:06:56.960 --> 01:07:01.370\ndd is easier cuz it's just the same key\ntwice, and it'll delete an entire line.\n\n1209\n01:07:01.370 --> 01:07:06.158\nSo it's a good way to wipe out a line\nentirely if you don't need it.\n\n1210\n01:07:06.158 --> 01:07:08.866\nLet's see what else do we have?\n\n1211\n01:07:08.866 --> 01:07:13.710\nDw, dd deletes an entire line,\ndw deletes a word.\n\n1212\n01:07:13.710 --> 01:07:17.860\nIf I do dw,\nsee how it deleted the webpage?\n\n1213\n01:07:17.860 --> 01:07:19.320\nWell, it deleted all but\nthe first character.\n\n1214\n01:07:20.380 --> 01:07:24.162\nI guess maybe I had my\ncursor in the wrong spot.\n\n1215\n01:07:24.162 --> 01:07:26.490\nYeah, I guess I was forward on it.\n\n1216\n01:07:26.490 --> 01:07:30.412\nBut if I highlight the first\ncharacter of a word and I do dw.\n\n1217\n01:07:30.412 --> 01:07:32.390\nThere it goes, so it kinda wipes that out.\n\n1218\n01:07:32.390 --> 01:07:36.144\nSo dd deletes the whole line,\ndw deletes the current word.\n\n1219\n01:07:36.144 --> 01:07:39.329\nAnd I think it's kinda-\n>> Yeah.\n\n1220\n01:07:39.329 --> 01:07:41.457\n>> Let me just check my little\nlist here of notes that I've got.\n\n1221\n01:07:41.457 --> 01:07:43.996\nThose are probably the main ones.\n\n1222\n01:07:43.996 --> 01:07:49.412\nLike I said, there are a ton of\ncommand shortcuts inside of Vi.\n\n1223\n01:07:49.412 --> 01:07:50.455\nIt is a very-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1224\n01:07:50.455 --> 01:07:51.912\n>> Powerful editor.\n\n1225\n01:07:51.912 --> 01:07:53.046\nI didn't even get into using your\n\n1226\n01:07:53.046 --> 01:07:53.830\nclipboard-\n>> Yeah.\n\n1227\n01:07:53.830 --> 01:07:56.885\n>> Where you can copy text and\npaste it, and so on.\n\n1228\n01:07:56.885 --> 01:07:58.353\nYou can do search and replaces.\n\n1229\n01:07:58.353 --> 01:07:59.408\nIt is powerful, but\n\n1230\n01:07:59.408 --> 01:08:03.455\nwhat I just showed you are the things\nan administrator is normally gonna use.\n\n1231\n01:08:03.455 --> 01:08:06.700\nIf we're gonna edit a config file or\nwhatever, that's probably all we need.\n\n1232\n01:08:06.700 --> 01:08:10.460\nSo if you just learn those few\nbasic commands, now you know Vi.\n\n1233\n01:08:10.460 --> 01:08:14.360\nAnd now, no matter what Linux Distro you\ngo to, or you go to a new server you've\n\n1234\n01:08:14.360 --> 01:08:18.080\nnever touched before, it's pretty much\na guarantee that Vi is gonna be on there.\n\n1235\n01:08:18.080 --> 01:08:20.523\nNano, maybe, maybe not.\n\n1236\n01:08:20.523 --> 01:08:25.954\nVim, maybe, maybe not,\nbut vi, it'll be there.\n\n1237\n01:08:25.954 --> 01:08:27.758\nNow we've got some more\ntime in this segment, so\n\n1238\n01:08:27.758 --> 01:08:30.010\nlet me just kind of show you\nthose other editors I mentioned.\n\n1239\n01:08:31.092 --> 01:08:33.490\nI'm gonna abandon my changes here,\nso I'll do a q!.\n\n1240\n01:08:35.570 --> 01:08:40.320\nAnd so if I wanna mess with that index\nfile that I just created a little more,\n\n1241\n01:08:40.320 --> 01:08:41.930\nif your system has nano,\n\n1242\n01:08:41.930 --> 01:08:45.720\nwhich most Redhat systems if you\ndo a full install will have nano.\n\n1243\n01:08:45.720 --> 01:08:50.990\nYou can run nano index.htmlm,\nand it'll edit that.\n\n1244\n01:08:50.990 --> 01:08:54.450\nNow a lot of people love nano because\n\n1245\n01:08:54.450 --> 01:08:57.220\nyour main shortcuts are right\nthere at the bottom of the screen.\n\n1246\n01:08:57.220 --> 01:09:02.537\nIt tells you, do wanna write the file to\nsave it, do yo wanna cut text, uncut?\n\n1247\n01:09:02.537 --> 01:09:04.190\nIt's telling you right there.\n\n1248\n01:09:04.190 --> 01:09:05.520\nAnd you can do Ctrl+G,\n\n1249\n01:09:05.520 --> 01:09:10.060\nthe little carrot symbol whatever\nthat up arrow, that means control.\n\n1250\n01:09:10.060 --> 01:09:14.890\nSo if I Ctrl+G, it'll give me the help\nscreen and I can sit here and\n\n1251\n01:09:14.890 --> 01:09:18.930\npage through it, and see all\nthe different short cuts that they have.\n\n1252\n01:09:18.930 --> 01:09:24.240\nSo a lot of people love nano, just because\nit's a little more user friendly that Vi.\n\n1253\n01:09:24.240 --> 01:09:26.288\nI can't argue with that.\n\n1254\n01:09:26.288 --> 01:09:29.650\nDefinitely more user friendly and\neasier to move around.\n\n1255\n01:09:29.650 --> 01:09:31.560\nThere's no insert mode and command mode.\n\n1256\n01:09:31.560 --> 01:09:34.414\nYou're always in insert mode,\nyou can always just go in and\n\n1257\n01:09:34.414 --> 01:09:35.620\ntype wherever you want.\n\n1258\n01:09:35.620 --> 01:09:36.760\nThis is some text.\n\n1259\n01:09:36.760 --> 01:09:39.000\nI didn't have to press\nanything to do that and\n\n1260\n01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:42.830\nthen you use Ctrl+short codes to\nbe able to or not short codes, but\n\n1261\n01:09:42.830 --> 01:09:47.270\ncontrol characters to be able\nto perform different actions.\n\n1262\n01:09:47.270 --> 01:09:49.510\nSo a little bit less of a learning curve,\n\n1263\n01:09:49.510 --> 01:09:53.460\na little bit easier to deal with,\nbut not present on every system.\n\n1264\n01:09:53.460 --> 01:09:55.710\nAnd in fact,\nin the episode where we installed CentOS,\n\n1265\n01:09:55.710 --> 01:09:58.330\nI did a minimal install and\nnano was not included.\n\n1266\n01:09:58.330 --> 01:10:01.919\nSo you may not have that and\nwhen I exit, it just asks me plain,\n\n1267\n01:10:01.919 --> 01:10:03.454\ndo you want to save or not?\n\n1268\n01:10:03.454 --> 01:10:05.320\nI just hit No, and there we go.\n\n1269\n01:10:05.320 --> 01:10:08.410\nSo definitely more user friendly.\n\n1270\n01:10:08.410 --> 01:10:10.810\nVim is another one.\n\n1271\n01:10:10.810 --> 01:10:13.330\nVim is an enhanced version of Vi.\n\n1272\n01:10:13.330 --> 01:10:16.130\nThey took vi and\nthey added more functionality to it.\n\n1273\n01:10:16.130 --> 01:10:20.860\nThey extended it out to do some advanced\ntype setting and things like that.\n\n1274\n01:10:20.860 --> 01:10:24.450\nIt's the one that does colorized tags and\n\n1275\n01:10:24.450 --> 01:10:28.730\nsyntax checking inside of your files,\nVi doesn't normally do that.\n\n1276\n01:10:28.730 --> 01:10:31.390\nSo on my install here,\nit's kinda mapped the two together.\n\n1277\n01:10:31.390 --> 01:10:38.079\nSo if I run vim ./index.html,\nit's gonna really just look like Vi.\n\n1278\n01:10:38.079 --> 01:10:40.320\nIt doesn't look any\ndifferent on this system.\n\n1279\n01:10:40.320 --> 01:10:43.917\nBut on systems whether not mapped\ntogether, Vi will be in black and\n\n1280\n01:10:43.917 --> 01:10:47.205\nwhite and it won't have any\nsyntax checking, in vim you do.\n\n1281\n01:10:47.205 --> 01:10:49.358\nNotice when I highlight one of my tags,\n\n1282\n01:10:49.358 --> 01:10:53.680\nit's highlighting the opening bracket\nas well as the close bracket.\n\n1283\n01:10:53.680 --> 01:10:58.035\nThat's so I can check and see if I'm\na programmer, when I'm in here and\n\n1284\n01:10:58.035 --> 01:11:00.079\nI'm writing some programming.\n\n1285\n01:11:00.079 --> 01:11:05.865\nAnd when I do something like I don't know,\n\n1286\n01:11:05.865 --> 01:11:12.954\nmaybe I call some kind of function and\nso I do like is_ssl,\n\n1287\n01:11:12.954 --> 01:11:17.747\nand I start providing some stuff to it.\n\n1288\n01:11:17.747 --> 01:11:21.270\nIt helps me to check and\nsee whether I've closed my brackets.\n\n1289\n01:11:21.270 --> 01:11:23.640\nAnd if I go even further inside of that,\nso\n\n1290\n01:11:23.640 --> 01:11:28.100\nI have something here I'm just\ngonna make some stuff up.\n\n1291\n01:11:28.100 --> 01:11:29.122\nI'm not a programmer so.\n\n1292\n01:11:29.122 --> 01:11:31.874\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So if I start to do,\n\n1293\n01:11:31.874 --> 01:11:35.662\nsome brackets like this,\nThis is something.\n\n1294\n01:11:35.662 --> 01:11:37.560\nAnd I start closing out,\nsee how it highlights them.\n\n1295\n01:11:37.560 --> 01:11:45.204\nAnd it's doing that because you might\nhave more than one tier of brackets.\n\n1296\n01:11:45.204 --> 01:11:48.736\nWe might be doing an if\nthen else whatever, and so\n\n1297\n01:11:48.736 --> 01:11:54.527\nI might be thinking that I'm closing off\nthis bracket here, when I do this one.\n\n1298\n01:11:54.527 --> 01:11:57.323\nBut it shows me visually that I'm\nactually closing this one up here.\n\n1299\n01:11:57.323 --> 01:11:59.306\nSo I can spot when I'm missing close back.\n\n1300\n01:11:59.306 --> 01:11:59.919\n>> That's nice.\n\n1301\n01:11:59.919 --> 01:12:00.486\n>> That's kinda nice.\n\n1302\n01:12:00.486 --> 01:12:01.811\nThat's a function of vim.\n\n1303\n01:12:01.811 --> 01:12:06.223\nAll right, if you're just running Vi\nby itself, it does not do that, okay?\n\n1304\n01:12:06.223 --> 01:12:11.660\nIt doesn't do syntax checking, and so you\nmay or may not have that functionality.\n\n1305\n01:12:11.660 --> 01:12:12.865\nHere it's just mapping together.\n\n1306\n01:12:12.865 --> 01:12:16.356\nSo, the normal Vi is black and\nwhite with no syntax checking.\n\n1307\n01:12:19.095 --> 01:12:25.847\nAll right, so that's Vim, that's Nano,\nthat's Vi, there's a ton of other ones.\n\n1308\n01:12:25.847 --> 01:12:33.009\nFor years I used one called Jed,\nwhich is apparently not, you know what?\n\n1309\n01:12:33.009 --> 01:12:37.382\nHang on,\nlet's see if I can install it real quick,\n\n1310\n01:12:37.382 --> 01:12:40.520\nif it's even available anymore.\n\n1311\n01:12:40.520 --> 01:12:42.700\nYeah, it's not available anymore.\n\n1312\n01:12:42.700 --> 01:12:46.089\nYeah, so for years, I used one called\nJed that was a lot more similar to\n\n1313\n01:12:46.089 --> 01:12:49.208\nthe DOS based editors and actually,\nit kind of looks like Nano.\n\n1314\n01:12:49.208 --> 01:12:52.563\nSo you may have ones that you like, but\nI got out of the habit of that a long time\n\n1315\n01:12:52.563 --> 01:12:55.571\nago just because I just didn't know\nif it was going to be available.\n\n1316\n01:12:55.571 --> 01:12:58.927\nAnd I didn't want to install it on\nservers because why install software that\n\n1317\n01:12:58.927 --> 01:13:00.457\nyou're just gonna use in a while.\n\n1318\n01:13:00.457 --> 01:13:04.313\nJust get used to what's already in there,\nthat's been my rule of thumb.\n\n1319\n01:13:04.313 --> 01:13:08.111\nAll right, now, sometimes I\nwanna see what's in a file, but\n\n1320\n01:13:08.111 --> 01:13:10.750\nI don't want to actually edit it, right?\n\n1321\n01:13:10.750 --> 01:13:12.750\nYou can use Vi to read files if you want.\n\n1322\n01:13:12.750 --> 01:13:16.056\nYou can fire up Vi, point to the file\nname and use it to read them, but\n\n1323\n01:13:16.056 --> 01:13:19.363\nthere's a few other commands we\ncan use to read files also, right?\n\n1324\n01:13:19.363 --> 01:13:24.450\nOne of the most common ones\nis the type command, right?\n\n1325\n01:13:24.450 --> 01:13:28.328\nSo, we can use type and\nthen whatever a file is,\n\n1326\n01:13:28.328 --> 01:13:32.590\nindex.html and you know what,\nI don't have the type command here.\n\n1327\n01:13:32.590 --> 01:13:34.750\nAll right well,\nwe can use the more command instead.\n\n1328\n01:13:34.750 --> 01:13:39.800\nSo we'll more .html, and\nit's gonna lay out that file for\n\n1329\n01:13:39.800 --> 01:13:42.710\nme, or more index.html, and\nit'll show me what's in there.\n\n1330\n01:13:42.710 --> 01:13:44.600\nSo here it is, here's the output.\n\n1331\n01:13:44.600 --> 01:13:48.480\nI can read it and this is not an editor,\nmore just does a screen print.\n\n1332\n01:13:48.480 --> 01:13:50.660\nIt prints that file out.\n\n1333\n01:13:50.660 --> 01:13:52.210\nSome systems'll have type also.\n\n1334\n01:13:52.210 --> 01:13:55.560\nYou see that a lot in Windows and\nother OS's, but\n\n1335\n01:13:55.560 --> 01:13:59.750\nmore is the other one and we can use\nthe more command to show us that.\n\n1336\n01:13:59.750 --> 01:14:03.730\nThe nice thing about the more command,\nif it's a really long file, a file\n\n1337\n01:14:03.730 --> 01:14:08.610\nthat has a ton of stuff in it, it may be\nmore than what can fit on your screen.\n\n1338\n01:14:08.610 --> 01:14:14.330\nYour normal shell only shows 24 lines, so\nwhat if your file has more than 24 lines?\n\n1339\n01:14:14.330 --> 01:14:16.360\nIt's gonna go off the screen.\n\n1340\n01:14:16.360 --> 01:14:20.730\nSo the more command will paginate the file\nfor you, every 24 lines, it'll stop and\n\n1341\n01:14:20.730 --> 01:14:25.570\ndisplay a more prompt, so\nthat you can see it in it's entirety.\n\n1342\n01:14:25.570 --> 01:14:27.943\nSo let me take a file here.\n\n1343\n01:14:27.943 --> 01:14:29.279\nWe'll take yum.conf.\n\n1344\n01:14:29.279 --> 01:14:32.261\nI think it is too long.\n\n1345\n01:14:32.261 --> 01:14:37.360\nYeah, so, I just did more yum.conf and\n\n1346\n01:14:38.410 --> 01:14:43.450\nwhen I run that, more yum.conf,\nthat file is too big to fit on the screen.\n\n1347\n01:14:43.450 --> 01:14:47.060\nIt's more than 24 lines and so\nit puts a more prompt right there.\n\n1348\n01:14:47.060 --> 01:14:51.350\nAnd then I can hit space and I can move\ndown and I can see the rest of it, okay?\n\n1349\n01:14:51.350 --> 01:14:52.960\nEnter moves down one line,\n\n1350\n01:14:52.960 --> 01:14:58.152\nspace moves down an entire screen, q quits\nout of it, so without displaying the rest.\n\n1351\n01:14:58.152 --> 01:15:01.390\nSo if I did more and then I just hit q,\nsee how it drops out,\n\n1352\n01:15:01.390 --> 01:15:02.840\nit doesn't display the rest.\n\n1353\n01:15:02.840 --> 01:15:07.800\nSo little modifiers there, but more is\nreally handy to view those, all right?\n\n1354\n01:15:07.800 --> 01:15:12.429\nNow, almost every modern distribution\nincludes another command,\n\n1355\n01:15:12.429 --> 01:15:14.530\nwhich is less, all right?\n\n1356\n01:15:14.530 --> 01:15:16.250\nMore has a little problem.\n\n1357\n01:15:16.250 --> 01:15:21.930\nIf I do more on a file and I press Enter,\nsee how it moves down a line?\n\n1358\n01:15:21.930 --> 01:15:25.514\nWell, I can't move back up,\nso more goes one way.\n\n1359\n01:15:25.514 --> 01:15:28.892\nYou can move forward in a file,\nbut you can't move backwards.\n\n1360\n01:15:28.892 --> 01:15:32.317\nLess will let you go both directions.\n\n1361\n01:15:32.317 --> 01:15:40.769\nSo if I use the less command to view\nyum.conf, I can go down and up.\n\n1362\n01:15:40.769 --> 01:15:42.860\nAnd I'm just using my\narrows keys to do that.\n\n1363\n01:15:42.860 --> 01:15:44.930\nYou can use page up and\npage down, whatever you want and\n\n1364\n01:15:44.930 --> 01:15:47.930\nso you can scroll both ways, all right?\n\n1365\n01:15:47.930 --> 01:15:51.430\nThe cool part there is you can see the\nwhole file, I am moving both directions.\n\n1366\n01:15:51.430 --> 01:15:55.057\nThe only negative is, it keeps you locked\nin the file so you have to use q to get\n\n1367\n01:15:55.057 --> 01:15:58.290\nout of that one cuz it doesn't know\nif you're gonna scroll back up or\n\n1368\n01:15:58.290 --> 01:16:00.017\nnot when you hit the end of the file.\n\n1369\n01:16:00.017 --> 01:16:03.571\nMore can't scroll up, so when it hits the\nend of the file, it automatically exits.\n\n1370\n01:16:03.571 --> 01:16:07.139\nLet me see if I can find a bigger file\nthan that one, that one wasn't very big.\n\n1371\n01:16:09.360 --> 01:16:12.390\nLet's do, vimrc is big enough.\n\n1372\n01:16:12.390 --> 01:16:18.220\nSo if I do more vimrc, all right, here's\none that if I use the more command, I can\n\n1373\n01:16:18.220 --> 01:16:23.040\nmove forward to page two, but now there's\nno way for me to go back up to page one.\n\n1374\n01:16:23.040 --> 01:16:28.340\nI just continue on page two, page three,\nand then it exits out and that's it.\n\n1375\n01:16:28.340 --> 01:16:31.567\nBut if I do less on that file,\nless vimmrc,\n\n1376\n01:16:31.567 --> 01:16:35.781\nI can use my space bar to move\nforward an entire page, but\n\n1377\n01:16:35.781 --> 01:16:40.736\nI can also use my arrow keys to\nscroll back up and scroll back down.\n\n1378\n01:16:40.736 --> 01:16:45.437\nSo I've gotten in the habit of using the\nless command just as my standard default.\n\n1379\n01:16:45.437 --> 01:16:50.625\nAnd in fact, on some systems, I'll alias\nthe more command to run less instead,\n\n1380\n01:16:50.625 --> 01:16:53.550\nbut you may or may not have both commands.\n\n1381\n01:16:53.550 --> 01:16:55.260\nLess is an optional command,\n\n1382\n01:16:55.260 --> 01:16:58.980\nit doesn't have to be present on the\nsystem, so your distro might not have it.\n\n1383\n01:16:58.980 --> 01:17:03.942\nMore will scroll forward through a file,\nless will go both directions.\n\n1384\n01:17:03.942 --> 01:17:08.297\nAll right,\nI want to get into piping commands, but\n\n1385\n01:17:08.297 --> 01:17:12.156\nwe're kind of at the end\nof the segment here.\n\n1386\n01:17:12.156 --> 01:17:13.050\nSo, let's do this.\n\n1387\n01:17:13.050 --> 01:17:16.930\nLet's stop here and take a break, and\nwhen we get back, I want to show you some\n\n1388\n01:17:16.930 --> 01:17:20.920\ncreative ways to use the more and\nless command that can really help us out.\n\n1389\n01:17:20.920 --> 01:17:22.535\nSo, some of the other things\nthat are pretty useful.\n\n1390\n01:17:22.535 --> 01:17:25.914\nSo stay tuned, more, more after this.\n\n1391\n01:17:25.914 --> 01:17:26.795\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1392\n01:17:26.795 --> 01:17:34.349\n[MUSIC]\n\n1393\n01:17:34.349 --> 01:17:38.076\nAll right, so before the break, we took\na look at the more and less commands and\n\n1394\n01:17:38.076 --> 01:17:41.634\nI knew I had forgotten a command, and\nso I checked my notes and sure enough,\n\n1395\n01:17:41.634 --> 01:17:44.600\nI left out one other command\nwhich is the cat command.\n\n1396\n01:17:44.600 --> 01:17:48.920\nCat is a really useful command for\nlisting the contents a file like more and\n\n1397\n01:17:48.920 --> 01:17:54.020\nless, but it doesn't do\npagination like more and less do.\n\n1398\n01:17:54.020 --> 01:17:57.960\nWhen you use cat, it just says give\nme the output of that file and\n\n1399\n01:17:57.960 --> 01:18:00.910\ndon't press any key or whatever.\n\n1400\n01:18:00.910 --> 01:18:05.992\nSo for example, when I did more/ect/vimrc,\nright, that was that big file and\n\n1401\n01:18:05.992 --> 01:18:10.798\nit was three pages, I had to page through\nit, right, cuz it was a long file.\n\n1402\n01:18:10.798 --> 01:18:15.692\nIf I had used cat instead, it would have\nlisted it and see how it just jumped right\n\n1403\n01:18:15.692 --> 01:18:20.091\nback to my cursor, that's cuz it\nlisted all three pages immediately.\n\n1404\n01:18:20.091 --> 01:18:22.670\nIt went so fast I didn't even see it.\n\n1405\n01:18:22.670 --> 01:18:27.010\nThere are times we might want\nto get the output of a file, and\n\n1406\n01:18:27.010 --> 01:18:28.160\nnot have it paginated.\n\n1407\n01:18:28.160 --> 01:18:30.230\nJust have it display the whole thing.\n\n1408\n01:18:30.230 --> 01:18:33.017\nSo give me the output of that file.\n\n1409\n01:18:33.017 --> 01:18:36.641\nAnd we usually use that when\nwe're taking that output, and\n\n1410\n01:18:36.641 --> 01:18:38.679\nfeeding it into something else.\n\n1411\n01:18:38.679 --> 01:18:42.659\nAnd that's how I remembered I forgot this\ncommand, cuz I wanna show you guys how to\n\n1412\n01:18:42.659 --> 01:18:46.050\ntake the output of one command,\nand feed it into something else.\n\n1413\n01:18:46.050 --> 01:18:48.550\nAnd the cat command is one\nof those that we often do.\n\n1414\n01:18:50.080 --> 01:18:53.700\nSo what you can do in the command line is,\n\n1415\n01:18:53.700 --> 01:18:59.430\nyou can take the output of any one\ncommand, and you can use the pipe symbol.\n\n1416\n01:18:59.430 --> 01:19:02.880\nThe pipe symbol on you keyboard,\nit's two vertical lines,\n\n1417\n01:19:02.880 --> 01:19:05.820\nalthough sometimes they draw it as one\nline, it's actually two vertical lines.\n\n1418\n01:19:05.820 --> 01:19:10.140\nIt's usually right above your Enter\nkey depending on your keyboard layout.\n\n1419\n01:19:10.140 --> 01:19:15.100\nAnd the pipe symbol says, take whatever\nthe output is of one command and\n\n1420\n01:19:15.100 --> 01:19:20.060\nthen take the output and\nfeed it as input to a second command.\n\n1421\n01:19:20.060 --> 01:19:26.300\nSo when you write it's basically command\n1 and then the pipe, command 2, right?\n\n1422\n01:19:26.300 --> 01:19:30.690\nSo whatever output comes from the first\ncommand then gets sent into the pipe and\n\n1423\n01:19:30.690 --> 01:19:33.790\nthen gets fed through whatever\ncommand number two is.\n\n1424\n01:19:33.790 --> 01:19:38.710\nNow, the command number two for\nme is often more or less, right?\n\n1425\n01:19:38.710 --> 01:19:40.200\nRemember earlier in this show,\n\n1426\n01:19:40.200 --> 01:19:43.610\nwhat command did I run with the help\nwent beyond the, I think it was ls.\n\n1427\n01:19:43.610 --> 01:19:46.856\n>> Yeah.\n>> Where I did ls--help, right?\n\n1428\n01:19:46.856 --> 01:19:51.615\nAnd when I ran that,\nsee how it's started up here with Z, -Z.\n\n1429\n01:19:51.615 --> 01:19:54.510\nThat's the very last modifier.\n\n1430\n01:19:54.510 --> 01:19:57.358\nThere were more that just\ndidn't fit on the screen,\n\n1431\n01:19:57.358 --> 01:20:00.410\nit just scrolled them right past it and\nI lost it, okay?\n\n1432\n01:20:00.410 --> 01:20:03.634\nSo, when I run ls--help,\nI lose some of that.\n\n1433\n01:20:03.634 --> 01:20:07.960\nBut what I could have done was stuck the,\nwe need to clear this.\n\n1434\n01:20:10.240 --> 01:20:14.270\nI could have stuck the pipe\ncommand after it, and\n\n1435\n01:20:14.270 --> 01:20:19.930\npiped that into more or\nless if I wanted to do that.\n\n1436\n01:20:19.930 --> 01:20:22.579\nAnd so that would say, run ls --help, and\n\n1437\n01:20:22.579 --> 01:20:27.234\ntake whatever you would have shown on\nthe screen whatever the output was, and\n\n1438\n01:20:27.234 --> 01:20:30.683\ngive it as input to less or\nmore, whichever one I wanted.\n\n1439\n01:20:30.683 --> 01:20:36.000\nAnd that's gonna give me\nthat output with pagination.\n\n1440\n01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:39.960\nI normally do more, cuz I'm looking for\nsomething specific but we'll do less.\n\n1441\n01:20:39.960 --> 01:20:43.390\nAnd now, here it displays\nthe first page of the help files.\n\n1442\n01:20:43.390 --> 01:20:44.470\nSo I've got A through F.\n\n1443\n01:20:46.050 --> 01:20:49.780\nAnd because I'm in less,\nI can use the up and down arrows or\n\n1444\n01:20:49.780 --> 01:20:51.240\nspace bar to jump ahead.\n\n1445\n01:20:51.240 --> 01:20:54.290\nAnd I can see, so there's -a, means all.\n\n1446\n01:20:54.290 --> 01:20:58.698\nAnd -L, I can scroll down here and\nfind -L.\n\n1447\n01:20:58.698 --> 01:21:02.070\nThere it is, use a long listing format.\n\n1448\n01:21:02.070 --> 01:21:04.110\nAnd so I can start to see what\nthese different tags are and\n\n1449\n01:21:04.110 --> 01:21:05.550\nI can go up and down.\n\n1450\n01:21:05.550 --> 01:21:09.750\nAnd now I can scroll all the way\ndown to Z if that's what I want or\n\n1451\n01:21:09.750 --> 01:21:11.970\nI can scroll back up and see the rest.\n\n1452\n01:21:11.970 --> 01:21:14.780\nReally useful, that pipe command.\n\n1453\n01:21:14.780 --> 01:21:19.640\nThe output from one command gets turned\ninto input for a second command.\n\n1454\n01:21:19.640 --> 01:21:23.790\nAnd I used it here with less, but\nyou can use it with darn near anything.\n\n1455\n01:21:23.790 --> 01:21:27.562\nYou can feed the output of one command\ninto another, and do all sorts of magic.\n\n1456\n01:21:27.562 --> 01:21:30.939\nI've seen some really impressive\nexamples over the years,\n\n1457\n01:21:30.939 --> 01:21:33.200\nbut this is one of the most common for me.\n\n1458\n01:21:34.300 --> 01:21:39.270\nSo just remember that you\ntype a command and then pipe.\n\n1459\n01:21:39.270 --> 01:21:42.860\nTake the output from command one and\nthen feed it as input into command two.\n\n1460\n01:21:44.180 --> 01:21:46.370\nThere is another one we could have used.\n\n1461\n01:21:46.370 --> 01:21:49.890\nInstead of a pipe,\nyou can use the greater than symbol.\n\n1462\n01:21:49.890 --> 01:21:54.430\nAnd that says, take the output of\na command and stick it into a file.\n\n1463\n01:21:55.470 --> 01:22:01.292\nSo I could have for example, run ls --help\nand user the greater than symbol to say,\n\n1464\n01:22:01.292 --> 01:22:05.230\ntake the output of that command and\nstick it in this file.\n\n1465\n01:22:05.230 --> 01:22:11.320\nStick it in ls --help.txt.\n\n1466\n01:22:11.320 --> 01:22:14.590\nSo when I run this, it's gonna\ncreate a file called ls --help.txt,\n\n1467\n01:22:14.590 --> 01:22:19.590\nand it's gonna stick all that\ncommand output into the text file.\n\n1468\n01:22:19.590 --> 01:22:22.438\nAnd so when I fun it,\nI don't see much here.\n\n1469\n01:22:22.438 --> 01:22:27.551\nBut if I so an ls -la, I can see that\nI know have a ls --help.txt file,\n\n1470\n01:22:27.551 --> 01:22:30.043\nand I can see that it is 7k in size.\n\n1471\n01:22:30.043 --> 01:22:36.018\nIt's got a lot of data in it,\nand if I do a less /ls-help.txt,\n\n1472\n01:22:36.018 --> 01:22:39.130\nI can open that up and there it is.\n\n1473\n01:22:39.130 --> 01:22:42.300\nThere's the help,\nall dumped into that text file.\n\n1474\n01:22:42.300 --> 01:22:43.740\nSo if I wanna save this for\n\n1475\n01:22:43.740 --> 01:22:47.850\nlater, the greater than symbol\nis really handy for that.\n\n1476\n01:22:47.850 --> 01:22:55.400\nSo greater than, will take command 1,\nand then file name.\n\n1477\n01:22:55.400 --> 01:23:00.040\nSo it takes the output of command 1 and\nit just sticks it into a file.\n\n1478\n01:23:00.040 --> 01:23:03.454\nAnd so we can use, like the cat command,\n\n1479\n01:23:03.454 --> 01:23:08.200\nand we could say,\ncat some file like that one.\n\n1480\n01:23:08.200 --> 01:23:13.950\nAnd then pipe that into\nsome other file locally.\n\n1481\n01:23:13.950 --> 01:23:16.140\nAnd it'll take the output of one and\ndump it right here.\n\n1482\n01:23:16.140 --> 01:23:18.950\nSo neat little systems\nthat we can use there.\n\n1483\n01:23:18.950 --> 01:23:21.840\nJust remember that pipe,\nwe use that for temporary things.\n\n1484\n01:23:21.840 --> 01:23:24.400\nOutput from one command gets\nfed into a second command.\n\n1485\n01:23:24.400 --> 01:23:25.320\nGreater than, that's for\n\n1486\n01:23:25.320 --> 01:23:28.890\nsomething you want to save, output of\none command then get save to another.\n\n1487\n01:23:28.890 --> 01:23:31.228\nAnd you can even do\ncombinations of some of them,\n\n1488\n01:23:31.228 --> 01:23:33.290\nI can't think of a great example off hand.\n\n1489\n01:23:33.290 --> 01:23:38.511\nBut I might cat some file, and\npipe that into the more command and\n\n1490\n01:23:38.511 --> 01:23:42.387\nthen take that output and\nsave that somewhere.\n\n1491\n01:23:42.387 --> 01:23:43.275\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Now,\n\n1492\n01:23:43.275 --> 01:23:46.130\nthat's gonna screw things up cuz\nmore requires human interaction.\n\n1493\n01:23:46.130 --> 01:23:49.350\nBut you could start to stack\nthese together or say,\n\n1494\n01:23:49.350 --> 01:23:52.520\ntake the output from more and\npipe that into something else.\n\n1495\n01:23:52.520 --> 01:23:56.590\nWe're gonna learn about search utilities\nlater like grep, and that's normally\n\n1496\n01:23:56.590 --> 01:23:59.280\nwhere we start stacking these\ntogether as we do searches and finds.\n\n1497\n01:24:02.670 --> 01:24:04.750\nA few other things worth talking about.\n\n1498\n01:24:06.320 --> 01:24:09.350\nAs we work with files,\nwe might wanna make duplicates.\n\n1499\n01:24:09.350 --> 01:24:13.200\nAnd we could use the cat file but\nthat really wreaks havoc with binaries.\n\n1500\n01:24:13.200 --> 01:24:18.400\nSo we are gonna make use of a few other\ncommands like copy move and rename.\n\n1501\n01:24:19.700 --> 01:24:24.230\nCopy just says, I wanna make a copy of\na file so that I have a second copy of it.\n\n1502\n01:24:24.230 --> 01:24:27.775\nMove means I wanna move the existing\nfiles somewhere else and\n\n1503\n01:24:27.775 --> 01:24:29.242\nnot leave behind a copy.\n\n1504\n01:24:29.242 --> 01:24:32.027\nSo copy and move,\nthose are pretty basic concepts.\n\n1505\n01:24:32.027 --> 01:24:35.713\nRename means I don't wanna move it\nanywhere, I don't wanna duplicate it,\n\n1506\n01:24:35.713 --> 01:24:37.160\nI just wanna change its name.\n\n1507\n01:24:37.160 --> 01:24:38.960\nSo let's take a look at each of these.\n\n1508\n01:24:38.960 --> 01:24:42.342\nThese follow the standard pattern of just\neliminating the vowels of the command for\n\n1509\n01:24:42.342 --> 01:24:42.979\nthe most part.\n\n1510\n01:24:42.979 --> 01:24:47.642\nSo If I wanna do copy,\nso I've got index.html.\n\n1511\n01:24:47.642 --> 01:24:49.690\nI wanna make a copy of it.\n\n1512\n01:24:49.690 --> 01:24:56.703\nSo I could just say cp,\nthat's copy, /index.html and\n\n1513\n01:24:56.703 --> 01:25:01.828\nthen I wanna copy it to /index2.html.\n\n1514\n01:25:01.828 --> 01:25:03.850\nAnd I'm putting the path\nreference in there.\n\n1515\n01:25:03.850 --> 01:25:06.230\nI really don't have to I\ncould get rid of those.\n\n1516\n01:25:06.230 --> 01:25:10.250\nAgain, that's just my own habit I like to\ndo that to ensure that I know where this\n\n1517\n01:25:10.250 --> 01:25:16.825\nstuff is going, but so you're not\ndoing CP index.html index2.html.\n\n1518\n01:25:16.825 --> 01:25:21.615\nAnd so I can pull up a directory listing,\nand I'll see that I now have two copies of\n\n1519\n01:25:21.615 --> 01:25:24.518\nthat index file right here,\nindex and index2.\n\n1520\n01:25:24.518 --> 01:25:26.585\nAnd they're identical\ncuz well I copied them.\n\n1521\n01:25:28.665 --> 01:25:30.965\nI can also do a move operation.\n\n1522\n01:25:30.965 --> 01:25:38.413\nSo for example, if I wanted to\nmove which would just be mv,\n\n1523\n01:25:38.413 --> 01:25:44.830\nI could move index2.html to ./Documents.\n\n1524\n01:25:44.830 --> 01:25:47.060\nI'm gonna move that into\nmy documents folder.\n\n1525\n01:25:48.620 --> 01:25:51.080\nSo when I do that,\nif I pull up my directory listing now,\n\n1526\n01:25:51.080 --> 01:25:54.290\nI can see that I don't\nhave index2 anymore.\n\n1527\n01:25:54.290 --> 01:25:58.810\nAnd if I change into my documents folder\nI can pull up the listing there and\n\n1528\n01:25:58.810 --> 01:26:03.230\nI'll see, there's index2.html, so\nI moved it to another location.\n\n1529\n01:26:04.500 --> 01:26:07.012\nYou can actually use move to\nrename files if you want.\n\n1530\n01:26:07.012 --> 01:26:08.980\nSo let me move that one back.\n\n1531\n01:26:11.623 --> 01:26:15.640\nSo I'm gonna do move index\nto that html..slash/.\n\n1532\n01:26:15.640 --> 01:26:19.140\nJust move it to the directory\nabove this one.\n\n1533\n01:26:19.140 --> 01:26:22.630\nAnd I go back there and check,\nthere it is it's there.\n\n1534\n01:26:22.630 --> 01:26:27.701\nIf I wanna rename\nindex2.html to index3.html,\n\n1535\n01:26:27.701 --> 01:26:32.783\nI could just type mv\nindex2.html index3.html.\n\n1536\n01:26:32.783 --> 01:26:36.889\nAnd it's gonna move it,\nchanging its name and so\n\n1537\n01:26:36.889 --> 01:26:43.340\nwhen I look at that I can see I longer\nhave index2.html I just have index3.\n\n1538\n01:26:43.340 --> 01:26:46.870\nSo for most of us, if you've been working\nwith Unix the operating system for\n\n1539\n01:26:46.870 --> 01:26:48.930\na long time,\nthat was how you renamed files.\n\n1540\n01:26:48.930 --> 01:26:51.970\nYou used the move command,\nthere didn't used to be a rename command.\n\n1541\n01:26:51.970 --> 01:26:56.070\nBut a lot of modern distributions have\nintroduced a rename command, and so\n\n1542\n01:26:56.070 --> 01:26:59.030\nyou actually can rename it,\nit really is just doing a move.\n\n1543\n01:26:59.030 --> 01:27:04.027\nSo I could rename index3.html\nto index2.html, and\n\n1544\n01:27:04.027 --> 01:27:08.185\nthat will just put it back\nto how it was before.\n\n1545\n01:27:08.185 --> 01:27:10.601\nJust be careful if you're\nworking on a really old system,\n\n1546\n01:27:10.601 --> 01:27:12.194\nyou may not have that rename command.\n\n1547\n01:27:12.194 --> 01:27:16.460\nIt hasn't been around that terribly\nlong in the Unix world, but\n\n1548\n01:27:16.460 --> 01:27:17.970\nmove is always there.\n\n1549\n01:27:17.970 --> 01:27:20.424\nSo I even find myself,\nwhen I'm reading files I still use move.\n\n1550\n01:27:23.280 --> 01:27:27.930\nSo that is copy, rename, move.\n\n1551\n01:27:27.930 --> 01:27:32.800\nThe last thing I wanna cover for\nthis show are some convenient shortcuts.\n\n1552\n01:27:32.800 --> 01:27:36.810\nShortcuts that are not necessarily\nrequired, but will help you and\n\n1553\n01:27:36.810 --> 01:27:37.940\nyou'll find that you use them a lot.\n\n1554\n01:27:39.130 --> 01:27:41.850\nOne thing is,\nI've been typing up all these file names.\n\n1555\n01:27:41.850 --> 01:27:43.175\nAnd if you're like me, you hate to type.\n\n1556\n01:27:43.175 --> 01:27:44.897\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And the more you have to type,\n\n1557\n01:27:44.897 --> 01:27:46.520\nthe more annoying it gets.\n\n1558\n01:27:46.520 --> 01:27:50.550\nSo a lot of distributions feature\nwhat is called tab auto complete.\n\n1559\n01:27:50.550 --> 01:27:53.573\nAnd that means that you can\ntype part of a filename and\n\n1560\n01:27:53.573 --> 01:27:58.195\nif you hit Tab, as long as that filename\nis unique it'll type out the rest of it.\n\n1561\n01:27:58.195 --> 01:28:01.084\nThat's pretty handy when you've got\nfilenames that are really long.\n\n1562\n01:28:01.084 --> 01:28:02.324\nLet me show you an example.\n\n1563\n01:28:02.324 --> 01:28:08.006\nLet me get into a directory\nthat has some real files.\n\n1564\n01:28:08.006 --> 01:28:11.460\nAll right, so maybe I want to mess\nwith this file up here that's called\n\n1565\n01:28:11.460 --> 01:28:13.169\nyum-groups-manager, right?\n\n1566\n01:28:13.169 --> 01:28:16.094\nThat's a nice long name and\nI don't want to type it, okay?\n\n1567\n01:28:16.094 --> 01:28:19.527\nSo, if I wanted to mess with that file,\n\n1568\n01:28:19.527 --> 01:28:24.219\nI could type ./yum-groups-manager, right?.\n\n1569\n01:28:24.219 --> 01:28:27.858\nBut, really, if I stop right here,\nand I just hit tab,\n\n1570\n01:28:27.858 --> 01:28:33.220\nthe system will see that there's only\none file that starts with yum-groups-m.\n\n1571\n01:28:33.220 --> 01:28:34.636\nAnd it'll recognize there's only one file.\n\n1572\n01:28:34.636 --> 01:28:37.011\nSo, when I hit Tab,\nit'll Tab auto complete it.\n\n1573\n01:28:37.011 --> 01:28:38.440\nThat's nice, right?\n\n1574\n01:28:38.440 --> 01:28:41.830\nIt doesn't work, though,\nif you don't type enough.\n\n1575\n01:28:41.830 --> 01:28:47.700\nIf I do /y, there's several commands that\nstart with /y, so Tab doesn't do anything,\n\n1576\n01:28:47.700 --> 01:28:51.252\nit just displays a list of everything\nthat it could've confused us with.\n\n1577\n01:28:51.252 --> 01:28:52.170\nAll right.\n\n1578\n01:28:52.170 --> 01:28:55.400\nAnd so, I need to type at least enough\n\n1579\n01:28:55.400 --> 01:28:58.310\nthat it can figure out who I need to be,\nall right?\n\n1580\n01:28:58.310 --> 01:29:01.540\nAnd if you press tab once,\nit doesn't do anything.\n\n1581\n01:29:01.540 --> 01:29:03.930\nIf you press tab twice,\nthen it gives you the list.\n\n1582\n01:29:03.930 --> 01:29:06.800\nSo, just be aware of that if\nit doesn't come up right away.\n\n1583\n01:29:06.800 --> 01:29:09.810\nSo, I can kinda start typing\na little more until I\n\n1584\n01:29:09.810 --> 01:29:12.900\nget enough that it's\nfinally able to find it.\n\n1585\n01:29:12.900 --> 01:29:13.700\nBut that is nice.\n\n1586\n01:29:13.700 --> 01:29:16.510\nIt does save you from having to\ntype some of the longer file names.\n\n1587\n01:29:16.510 --> 01:29:21.280\nIt also helps with case sensitivity cuz\nit'll make sure casing is right, and\n\n1588\n01:29:21.280 --> 01:29:24.820\nyou don't, you make less mistakes,\nI suppose.\n\n1589\n01:29:24.820 --> 01:29:26.550\nAll right.\nSo, that's one thing.\n\n1590\n01:29:26.550 --> 01:29:31.470\nThe other thing is, as you start typing\nlonger and longer commands, right?\n\n1591\n01:29:31.470 --> 01:29:36.404\nSo, if I'm doing cp ./yum-groups-manager,\nand\n\n1592\n01:29:36.404 --> 01:29:40.878\nI want to type that to /home/ here we go.\n\n1593\n01:29:40.878 --> 01:29:48.440\n/yum-groups, and I'm starting to go off\nmy screen here, but that'll be fine.\n\n1594\n01:29:48.440 --> 01:29:52.976\nWell, I really want to,\nlet me start up top.\n\n1595\n01:29:52.976 --> 01:29:53.500\nOkay.\n\n1596\n01:29:53.500 --> 01:29:59.415\nSo, I wanna copy the yum groups manager,\nand I wanna copy it to my home directory.\n\n1597\n01:29:59.415 --> 01:30:08.651\n/videos/yumgroupsmanager.\n\n1598\n01:30:08.651 --> 01:30:09.386\nYou know what?\n\n1599\n01:30:09.386 --> 01:30:11.905\nI forgot my whole point in doing this,\nwhich was to make a mistake.\n\n1600\n01:30:11.905 --> 01:30:12.473\n>> Slash.\n\n1601\n01:30:12.473 --> 01:30:17.177\nIt's hard to make a mistake\non purpose sometimes.\n\n1602\n01:30:18.598 --> 01:30:21.180\nThere.\nI want to make a backup of this file.\n\n1603\n01:30:21.180 --> 01:30:24.420\nAnd so, I type in this great\nbig long command, okay?\n\n1604\n01:30:24.420 --> 01:30:25.820\nNow, I made a mistake in here.\n\n1605\n01:30:25.820 --> 01:30:29.490\nIf you notice,\nI've got /home/deposette, right?\n\n1606\n01:30:29.490 --> 01:30:32.850\nBut my folder's dpezet, so\nI've got a typo in my folder name.\n\n1607\n01:30:32.850 --> 01:30:37.070\nIf I try and run this, I'm gonna get\nan error, no such file or directory.\n\n1608\n01:30:37.070 --> 01:30:39.210\nWell, I need to fix my mistake.\n\n1609\n01:30:39.210 --> 01:30:40.860\nBut I just typed that big long command.\n\n1610\n01:30:40.860 --> 01:30:42.890\nI don't want to retype the whole thing.\n\n1611\n01:30:42.890 --> 01:30:47.785\nSo, one of the nice things about Linux,\nand just the bash pump in general,\n\n1612\n01:30:47.785 --> 01:30:51.825\nis that it is keeping a history of\nthe commands that you've typed.\n\n1613\n01:30:51.825 --> 01:30:52.820\nIf you ever type history,\n\n1614\n01:30:52.820 --> 01:30:56.925\nit'll actually show you the last\nseries of commands you've run.\n\n1615\n01:30:56.925 --> 01:30:59.951\nAnd so, here it is,\nit just reads like a, I don't know,\n\n1616\n01:30:59.951 --> 01:31:02.155\nlike a transcript to this episode.\n\n1617\n01:31:02.155 --> 01:31:04.045\nHere's all the various\ncommands that I've run.\n\n1618\n01:31:04.045 --> 01:31:08.590\nThen you can see the second to last\none is that long copy that I did.\n\n1619\n01:31:08.590 --> 01:31:13.320\nSo, the cool thing here is, on your\nkeyboard, you can use your arrow keys.\n\n1620\n01:31:13.320 --> 01:31:15.969\nAnd you can just press, let me clear this.\n\n1621\n01:31:15.969 --> 01:31:20.385\nYou can press up to scroll back\nthrough all the commands you've typed,\n\n1622\n01:31:20.385 --> 01:31:23.250\nand you can press down to scroll forward.\n\n1623\n01:31:23.250 --> 01:31:24.260\nSo, up and\n\n1624\n01:31:24.260 --> 01:31:29.340\ndown on your arrow keys will let you\nbring those commands back up again.\n\n1625\n01:31:29.340 --> 01:31:32.190\nSo, instead of having to\nretype that whole command,\n\n1626\n01:31:32.190 --> 01:31:36.590\nI can just press up, pull it up again,\nand then use my left and\n\n1627\n01:31:36.590 --> 01:31:41.180\nright arrow keys to scroll through it and\nfind the mistake and fix it.\n\n1628\n01:31:41.180 --> 01:31:44.270\nSo, I can find that mistake and fix it.\n\n1629\n01:31:44.270 --> 01:31:45.210\nPress enter.\n\n1630\n01:31:45.210 --> 01:31:48.640\nAnd now, it's gonna copy it, although\napparently I've got some other mistake.\n\n1631\n01:31:48.640 --> 01:31:51.240\nDid I delete my videos directory?\n\n1632\n01:31:51.240 --> 01:31:51.870\n>> I think you did.\n\n1633\n01:31:51.870 --> 01:31:52.850\n>> I probably did.\n\n1634\n01:31:52.850 --> 01:31:55.052\nSo, I probably deleted\nthat directory earlier.\n\n1635\n01:31:55.052 --> 01:31:57.790\nSo, if I just get rid of that,\nthere we go.\n\n1636\n01:31:57.790 --> 01:32:01.640\nSo, right there, I was able to use the up\nkey and save a little bit of time.\n\n1637\n01:32:01.640 --> 01:32:04.560\nSo, up and down,\nscroll through your history of commands.\n\n1638\n01:32:04.560 --> 01:32:08.620\nLeft and right let you scroll through\nthe command itself to make changes.\n\n1639\n01:32:08.620 --> 01:32:09.480\nAll right.\n\n1640\n01:32:09.480 --> 01:32:10.480\nNow, here's the problem.\n\n1641\n01:32:11.540 --> 01:32:15.250\nIf you're sitting locally at\nthe console of your Linux server or\n\n1642\n01:32:15.250 --> 01:32:17.510\nwork station, these will work just fine.\n\n1643\n01:32:17.510 --> 01:32:19.910\nThe arrow keys on your\nkeyboard will work just fine.\n\n1644\n01:32:19.910 --> 01:32:23.820\nBut if you're coming in via SSH or\nsome other protocol like that,\n\n1645\n01:32:23.820 --> 01:32:28.170\nthe client you're using may not\nproperly send the arrow keys.\n\n1646\n01:32:28.170 --> 01:32:30.400\nThe arrow keys may not work.\n\n1647\n01:32:30.400 --> 01:32:33.830\nAnd so, there are control\ncode shortcuts that we can\n\n1648\n01:32:33.830 --> 01:32:37.640\nuse that will allow us to do\nthese same things, right?\n\n1649\n01:32:37.640 --> 01:32:39.080\nAnd these are ones that, really,\n\n1650\n01:32:39.080 --> 01:32:41.500\nyou just kinda have to memorize\nthem to get use to them.\n\n1651\n01:32:41.500 --> 01:32:43.680\nI'll post them along with the episode.\n\n1652\n01:32:43.680 --> 01:32:50.127\nBut if your up and down arrow keys don't\nwork, you can use Ctrl+P and Ctrl+N.\n\n1653\n01:32:50.127 --> 01:32:54.800\nCtrl+P for previous, Ctrl+N for next.\n\n1654\n01:32:54.800 --> 01:32:58.980\nIf I hit Ctrl+P,\nit's the same as hitting the up arrow.\n\n1655\n01:32:58.980 --> 01:33:02.680\nAnd if I hit Ctrl+N,\nit's the same as hitting the down arrow.\n\n1656\n01:33:02.680 --> 01:33:04.910\nSo, previous and next commands.\n\n1657\n01:33:04.910 --> 01:33:09.005\nThat's how I remember,\nCtrl+P, Ctrl+N, all right?\n\n1658\n01:33:09.005 --> 01:33:12.140\nIf I bring up my command and\nI wanna fix that mistake,\n\n1659\n01:33:12.140 --> 01:33:14.710\nI wanna fix depezet, all right?\n\n1660\n01:33:14.710 --> 01:33:19.690\nIf my left and right arrow keys aren't\nworking, I need my control codes.\n\n1661\n01:33:19.690 --> 01:33:24.109\nAnd so, I can use Ctrl+B for back, and\n\n1662\n01:33:24.109 --> 01:33:27.950\nCtrl +F for forward, okay?\n\n1663\n01:33:27.950 --> 01:33:32.860\nSo, back and forward, Ctrl+B and Ctrl+F.\n\n1664\n01:33:32.860 --> 01:33:33.580\nAll right.\n\n1665\n01:33:33.580 --> 01:33:36.710\nNow, those are the ones we need if\nwe're trying to replace our arrow keys.\n\n1666\n01:33:36.710 --> 01:33:37.250\nAnd so,\n\n1667\n01:33:37.250 --> 01:33:40.440\nI remember those from when I'm using\nclients that don't support the arrow keys.\n\n1668\n01:33:40.440 --> 01:33:42.940\nBut there's a few other shortcuts\nthat I use all the time,\n\n1669\n01:33:42.940 --> 01:33:45.140\neven if my arrow keys do work, right?\n\n1670\n01:33:45.140 --> 01:33:48.240\nWhat if my mistake were at\nthe very beginning of the command?\n\n1671\n01:33:48.240 --> 01:33:51.190\nWhat if I didn't want to copy\nI wanted to move,all right?\n\n1672\n01:33:51.190 --> 01:33:55.160\nWell, I don't wanna to hold my arrow and\nscroll all the way back like that.\n\n1673\n01:33:55.160 --> 01:33:57.260\nThat's kind of a hassle, right?\n\n1674\n01:33:57.260 --> 01:34:00.440\nOr if I move all the way back, and\nthen I need to go to the end of the line.\n\n1675\n01:34:00.440 --> 01:34:05.530\nSo, there's short cuts, ctrl+a and ctrl+e.\n\n1676\n01:34:05.530 --> 01:34:09.520\nA, think of it as alpha,\nit jumps to the beginning of the line.\n\n1677\n01:34:09.520 --> 01:34:12.130\nAnd E is the end of the line.\n\n1678\n01:34:12.130 --> 01:34:16.070\nIf you hit ctrl+e, you'll jump to\nthe end of the command you're executing.\n\n1679\n01:34:16.070 --> 01:34:18.800\nAnd ctrl+a will take you to the beginning.\n\n1680\n01:34:18.800 --> 01:34:22.470\nSo, I use these even if my arrow\nkeys are working just fine.\n\n1681\n01:34:22.470 --> 01:34:25.220\nCuz I don't wanna hold the arrow\nkey to move along there.\n\n1682\n01:34:25.220 --> 01:34:28.530\nSo, ctrl+a, ctrl+e,\nbeginning of the line and end of the line.\n\n1683\n01:34:30.322 --> 01:34:33.400\nAll right.' Let's see, I think there's\nonly one other that I'm missing, and\n\n1684\n01:34:33.400 --> 01:34:35.012\nthat is-\n>> Backspace.\n\n1685\n01:34:35.012 --> 01:34:36.530\n>> Backspace, yeah.\n\n1686\n01:34:36.530 --> 01:34:41.460\nWhen you connect in via a shell client,\nso, you're coming in via our login.\n\n1687\n01:34:41.460 --> 01:34:42.220\nTelnet.\n\n1688\n01:34:42.220 --> 01:34:44.320\nSSH, whatever it is that you're using.\n\n1689\n01:34:44.320 --> 01:34:47.550\nIt's possible that your backspace\nkey might not be mapped.\n\n1690\n01:34:47.550 --> 01:34:51.280\nNow, keep in mind that most Linux systems\ndon't actually use backspace and delete.\n\n1691\n01:34:51.280 --> 01:34:53.450\nSo, if you have two keys on your keyboard,\nbackspace and delete,\n\n1692\n01:34:53.450 --> 01:34:56.840\nthey probably do the same thing,\nthey both operate as backspace.\n\n1693\n01:34:56.840 --> 01:35:00.850\nBut even still, when you SSH in,\nfor example, your client might\n\n1694\n01:35:00.850 --> 01:35:04.380\nnot map it right and your backspace\nkey might not work, all right?\n\n1695\n01:35:04.380 --> 01:35:07.910\nSo, the keyboard shortcut for\nback space is ctrl+h.\n\n1696\n01:35:07.910 --> 01:35:10.375\nAnd I don't know what h is short for.\n\n1697\n01:35:10.375 --> 01:35:10.916\n>> Me neither.\n\n1698\n01:35:10.916 --> 01:35:13.040\n>> Yeah, that one I just have to memorize.\n\n1699\n01:35:13.040 --> 01:35:14.670\nSo, if you want to delete something,\n\n1700\n01:35:14.670 --> 01:35:19.970\nlike I want to delete out that extra e\nin my name, I can use control f and b,\n\n1701\n01:35:19.970 --> 01:35:24.910\nforward and back, to get where I want, and\nI can put my cursor in front of the e,\n\n1702\n01:35:24.910 --> 01:35:28.090\nbecause, remember,\nbackspace goes backwards, right?\n\n1703\n01:35:28.090 --> 01:35:31.640\nSo, I can get in front of it,\nand then I can hit ctrl+h.\n\n1704\n01:35:31.640 --> 01:35:34.100\nAnd cgrl+h is the same as backspace.\n\n1705\n01:35:34.100 --> 01:35:37.190\nI don't use that one very often, it would\njust be if my client didn't support it.\n\n1706\n01:35:37.190 --> 01:35:39.240\nAnd if my client doesn't support it,\n\n1707\n01:35:39.240 --> 01:35:41.930\nI'm normally gonna change\nthe client to fix that, right?\n\n1708\n01:35:41.930 --> 01:35:47.270\nIf you're using something like putty or,\nthe OpenSSH\n\n1709\n01:35:47.270 --> 01:35:50.700\nclient that's just built into most Linux\ndistros, it's gonna work fine, right?\n\n1710\n01:35:50.700 --> 01:35:53.820\nBut if you're using older stuff,\na lot of times it'll break, and\n\n1711\n01:35:53.820 --> 01:35:54.800\nyou'll have to deal with that.\n\n1712\n01:35:54.800 --> 01:35:56.820\nSo, normally I just adjust the client.\n\n1713\n01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:02.170\nSo, a couple of nice little shortcuts\nthere, pretty handy to use.\n\n1714\n01:36:02.170 --> 01:36:05.280\nSaves you from a lot of extra typing and\nfussing around with commands.\n\n1715\n01:36:06.680 --> 01:36:09.130\nSo, let's see,\nI think that pretty much tackles it.\n\n1716\n01:36:09.130 --> 01:36:12.400\nI've got a few others that I wanna cover,\nbut we don't really have enough time for.\n\n1717\n01:36:12.400 --> 01:36:16.430\nI wanna cover searching for files,\nsearching through the contents of files.\n\n1718\n01:36:16.430 --> 01:36:20.240\nThose are some of the other things\nan admin will do, but I'll save those for\n\n1719\n01:36:20.240 --> 01:36:21.430\nanother episode.\n\n1720\n01:36:21.430 --> 01:36:25.430\nWhat we've seen today, though,\nshould serve as a basic primer for\n\n1721\n01:36:25.430 --> 01:36:27.210\nusing the command line interface.\n\n1722\n01:36:27.210 --> 01:36:30.420\nAnd if you're working in Linux,\nor really any UNIX-based system,\n\n1723\n01:36:30.420 --> 01:36:35.010\neven OSX if you're using a Mac,\nthese commands, they're standard.\n\n1724\n01:36:35.010 --> 01:36:36.500\nThey're available on all the systems.\n\n1725\n01:36:36.500 --> 01:36:37.700\nThese should all be committed to memory.\n\n1726\n01:36:37.700 --> 01:36:40.810\nSo, all the different commands we\ntalked about today really should be\n\n1727\n01:36:40.810 --> 01:36:42.250\nright here in your noodle.\n\n1728\n01:36:42.250 --> 01:36:45.278\nAnd like I said,\nI've got my my cheat cheat of notes here\n\n1729\n01:36:45.278 --> 01:36:48.060\nthat made sure I didn't\n'miss any commands.\n\n1730\n01:36:48.060 --> 01:36:51.300\nAnd I'll post this with the episodes so\nyou have that list available.\n\n1731\n01:36:51.300 --> 01:36:53.790\nBut that's basically our intro.\n\n1732\n01:36:53.790 --> 01:36:56.400\n>> Yeah, no.\nEven not being familiar with\n\n1733\n01:36:56.400 --> 01:36:59.480\nthe concept that seem that difficult,\nit takes time.\n\n1734\n01:36:59.480 --> 01:37:02.330\nThat's why we actually got to\nthe ability to install Install\n\n1735\n01:37:02.330 --> 01:37:05.460\nthe operating system right away, and\nnow you can practice these commands,\n\n1736\n01:37:05.460 --> 01:37:09.510\nget them to the point where you\nare actually memorizing these things.\n\n1737\n01:37:09.510 --> 01:37:13.010\n>> And even if you install the GUI, if\nyou did the graphical user interface for\n\n1738\n01:37:13.010 --> 01:37:14.570\nwhatever distro you installed,\n\n1739\n01:37:14.570 --> 01:37:18.430\nyou could just browse through a little\nfile explorer, Nautilus or whatever, and\n\n1740\n01:37:18.430 --> 01:37:21.570\ngo through and find your files and\ndelete them that way But you know what?\n\n1741\n01:37:21.570 --> 01:37:22.970\nMake yourself use the shell.\n\n1742\n01:37:22.970 --> 01:37:25.950\nFire up that terminal window,\nand do it from the command line.\n\n1743\n01:37:25.950 --> 01:37:28.530\nCuz the only way you're gonna\nremember these is through repetition.\n\n1744\n01:37:28.530 --> 01:37:31.450\nThe more you use them,\nthe easier it becomes to remember them.\n\n1745\n01:37:31.450 --> 01:37:32.880\nSo, all right.\n\n1746\n01:37:32.880 --> 01:37:35.520\nWell, that's probably a pretty\ngood spot for us to stop.\n\n1747\n01:37:35.520 --> 01:37:36.550\nLet me just remind you

going, Ronnie?\n\n11\n00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:44.240\n>> It is going a little bit\nunusually this morning.\n\n12\n00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:48.300\nAfter reading on the Internet, I found out\nthat Kim Kardashian is coming out with her\n\n13\n00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.660\nown mobile application for\nsomething that she's gonna do.\n\n14\n00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:52.610\n>> Sweet.\n>> Yeah.\n\n15\n00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:53.920\n>> Tell me it's a multiplayer game.\n\n16\n00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.065\n>> It's got to be at least\na multiplayer game [LAUGH].\n\n17\n00:00:56.065 --> 00:00:57.075\n>> It'll probably be pong.\n\n18\n00:00:57.075 --> 00:00:57.933\n>> It'll be [LAUGH].\n\n19\n00:00:57.933 --> 00:01:00.507\n>> It probably takes coin pay,\ntoo [LAUGH].\n\n20\n00:01:00.507 --> 00:01:01.500\n>> See, now there we're talking.\n\n21\n00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.960\nSee, guys, it's all about marketing.\n\n22\n00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:03.650\n>> That's right.\n\n23\n00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:07.950\n>> All right, well today, we got another\nepisode of Linux Plus lined up for us,\n\n24\n00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.140\nand we got some neat stuff.\n\n25\n00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.930\nI know yesterday's episode,\nwe tackled the command line interface,\n\n26\n00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.850\nand we started out with\nsome really basic commands.\n\n27\n00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.480\nAnd for those of you that have been\nLinux users for years, I won't blame\n\n28\n00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:23.500\nyou if you hit the fast forward button or\nif you skipped past that episode.\n\n29\n00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.140\nIf you've been working with Linux,\nthe commands we covered in that last\n\n30\n00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.430\nepisode are pretty much required commands,\nso you're gonna know them.\n\n31\n00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.780\nBut if you're new to it,\nthat was a very important episode,\n\n32\n00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.990\ncuz we covered basic commands that we're\ngonna be using all throughout the show.\n\n33\n00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.770\n>> Right.\n>> Today,\n\n34\n00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.240\nwe've got command line interface,\npart two.\n\n35\n00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.970\nAnd we're gonna move into\nsome more advanced commands.\n\n36\n00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.920\nI wanna start off with some nice,\ngeneral commands that I use a lot as\n\n37\n00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.810\nan administrator, just things\nthat I use on a general basis for\n\n38\n00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.300\nworking with my system and\njust monitoring, maintaining the system.\n\n39\n00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.410\nNow we're gonna take a look at some\ncommands we can use to manipulate text on\n\n40\n00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:59.815\nour system, either finding text or\nchanging text.\n\n41\n00:01:59.815 --> 00:02:02.630\nWe'll see there's a lot of\nstring commands that we can use\n\n42\n00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:03.526\nfrom the command line interface.\n\n43\n00:02:03.526 --> 00:02:08.130\nAnd then we're gonna wrap up the show,\ntalking about how to multitask.\n\n44\n00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:09.812\nA command line interface,\nyou might look at it and\n\n45\n00:02:09.812 --> 00:02:11.690\nthink that's not really geared up for\nmultitasking.\n\n46\n00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.820\nBut Linux is a multitasking\noperating system deep in its heart.\n\n47\n00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:18.640\nAnd so we can actually do that even\nthough we're in the command line.\n\n48\n00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.240\nSo you'll see some really\ncool things there.\n\n49\n00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.370\nSo all in all, exciting show lined up.\n\n50\n00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:23.340\n>> Yeah, sounds great.\n\n51\n00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.560\n>> So, all right, let's start off\nwith some of our general commands.\n\n52\n00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.560\nAnd one of the most\nimportant ones is one that\n\n53\n00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.110\nI thought about covering in yesterday's\nshow, but I decided to hold off for here.\n\n54\n00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.280\nIt's the man command, all right?\n\n55\n00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.380\nAnd it's not just for men,\nwomen can use it too.\n\n56\n00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.020\nAlthough the joke I always hear is that\nmen don't like to use this command,\n\n57\n00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:43.430\nit's the manual command.\n\n58\n00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.970\n>> Right.\n\n59\n00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.970\n>> If you don't know how a command works,\nyou can read the manual, right?\n\n60\n00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.890\nThe RTFM joke that you see all the time.\n\n61\n00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.670\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You can read the manual.\n\n62\n00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.550\nAnd whether you like it or not there\nare times where you just have to go over\n\n63\n00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.120\nthe documentation, and\nthat's what the man command is all about.\n\n64\n00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.450\nSo, yesterday we learned about ls,\nthe list command.\n\n65\n00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.809\nAnd I used ls-l and ls-a, and\nthen we combined them, ls-la.\n\n66\n00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:09.280\nHow do I know about\nthose command modifiers?\n\n67\n00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.060\nWell, yeah, I memorized them.\n\n68\n00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.875\nBut I had to learn them from somewhere.\n\n69\n00:03:12.875 --> 00:03:16.463\nAnd you might have ls--help, or\nyou can pull up the help file, right?\n\n70\n00:03:16.463 --> 00:03:20.405\nSo you've got that available,\nor you can pull up the manual.\n\n71\n00:03:20.405 --> 00:03:23.445\nMost Linux commands are very\nwell documented, and so\n\n72\n00:03:23.445 --> 00:03:25.850\nyou can use the man command to find out.\n\n73\n00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:29.686\nAnd so let's go to my little\nCentOS machine here, and\n\n74\n00:03:29.686 --> 00:03:32.030\nI'll do man ls, all right?\n\n75\n00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:36.780\nThat's gonna bring up the manual file for\nls, [COUGH] and here it is.\n\n76\n00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.540\nI can see the name of the command,\nit is the list directory contents command.\n\n77\n00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.752\nI can see the synopsis, how the command\nbasically works, ls followed by\n\n78\n00:03:43.752 --> 00:03:49.150\nany options, followed by any special\nfiles that I might be looking for.\n\n79\n00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.602\nAnd then I see the options.\n\n80\n00:03:51.602 --> 00:03:55.420\nAnd it's actually, in CentOS,\nit's filtered through the less command, so\n\n81\n00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.320\nI can use the up and\ndown arrows to move through it, and\n\n82\n00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.570\nyou can use forward slash search,\nit is kind of nice.\n\n83\n00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:05.400\nBut I can see, there's the dash a that\nI used, which is the all command.\n\n84\n00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.270\nDash capital A is almost all.\n\n85\n00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:11.910\nAnd you'll see,\nit excludes the dot and dot dot.\n\n86\n00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:13.810\nAnd where's L?\n\n87\n00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:14.620\nL is in here somewhere.\n\n88\n00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.580\nIt'll say to use the long form.\n\n89\n00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:17.350\nThere it is.\n\n90\n00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:19.130\nUse a long-listing format.\n\n91\n00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:20.690\nSo there's that one too.\n\n92\n00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:24.290\nBut you can see all of the other\nextensions that are available.\n\n93\n00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:27.760\nAnd these are ones that are not as\ncommonly used, but you might need.\n\n94\n00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.470\nMaybe there's something specific\nthat you're looking for and\n\n95\n00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:31.900\nyou want to find it.\n\n96\n00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:36.250\nSo [COUGH] for example,\nI know a lot of people use H, right.\n\n97\n00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:42.475\nH makes things human readable, and\nwhat I mean by that is, if we go into\n\n98\n00:04:42.475 --> 00:04:47.685\nlike a directory with a bunch of files,\nall right, and I do an ls-la.\n\n99\n00:04:47.685 --> 00:04:49.730\nLook at the file sizes.\n\n100\n00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:52.100\nThe file sizes are listed in bytes.\n\n101\n00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:54.865\nAnd bytes, that might not be\nvery intuitive to people,\n\n102\n00:04:54.865 --> 00:04:58.130\nthey want to convert it into megabytes,\ngigabytes, kilobytes, whatever.\n\n103\n00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:03.560\nSo we could say ls-lah, and\nnow those sizes are human readable.\n\n104\n00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:08.880\nAnd I can see, 4.4k,\n100k, 10m for megabyte.\n\n105\n00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.010\nSo, megs, gigs, kilobytes,\nit's kind of sorted and\n\n106\n00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:14.560\nlisted in a way that's\na little more human readable.\n\n107\n00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:17.960\nYou might not know that option is there,\nbut when you look at the manual,\n\n108\n00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:20.420\nthe man page for it, it will be in there.\n\n109\n00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:22.140\nAnd almost every command has it.\n\n110\n00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:25.880\nNow you will stumble every now and\nthen on a command that doesn't have it.\n\n111\n00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:29.725\nSo like, let's do a test.\n\n112\n00:05:29.725 --> 00:05:32.765\nI install the MySQL client on here.\n\n113\n00:05:32.765 --> 00:05:34.255\nNo, it's got it, shoot.\n\n114\n00:05:34.255 --> 00:05:38.835\nTrying to think of a command that, I know,\nit's hard to find one that's broken.\n\n115\n00:05:38.835 --> 00:05:42.025\nNormally if somebody finds one that's\nbroken, they write the man page for it,\n\n116\n00:05:42.025 --> 00:05:44.640\nso you'll see that pretty frequently.\n\n117\n00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:47.470\nBut pretty much any command line\nutility should have a man page.\n\n118\n00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:50.840\nYou just find them, install them.\n\n119\n00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:57.195\nIt is possible that when\nyou did your install,\n\n120\n00:05:57.195 --> 00:05:59.320\nyou might not have\ninstalled the manual pages,\n\n121\n00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:02.370\nif you did the super minimal install,\nit might not have done it.\n\n122\n00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:06.470\nSo in that case when you run man whatever,\nyou'll just constantly get failures back.\n\n123\n00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:08.640\nBut you can install the man pages,\n\n124\n00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:10.750\nI'm trying to remember what\nthat package name is called.\n\n125\n00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:17.040\nIt's called something like,\nI think you have to do it by the group.\n\n126\n00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:20.560\nLet me do a group list.\n\n127\n00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:25.090\nAnd I should have filtered\nthat through less.\n\n128\n00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:28.120\nAll right, so the manual pages\nare listed in here somewhere.\n\n129\n00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:30.650\nYou know what?\n\n130\n00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:32.620\nI'm not sure which package they're in.\n\n131\n00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:35.220\nBut if you did the really minimal install,\n\n132\n00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:38.340\nlike the base install,\nit might not have included the man pages.\n\n133\n00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:40.300\nAnd so you just need to go in and\ninstall the group that has them,\n\n134\n00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:41.740\nI can't remember its name offhand.\n\n135\n00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:44.820\nBut almost all default\ninstalls will have it.\n\n136\n00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:48.420\nI did the base server install on this one,\nso I've got my man pages just fine.\n\n137\n00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:50.890\nAnd you can pull up that list.\n\n138\n00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:54.660\nNow, if a command is not installed,\nlike let's say, wget, right?\n\n139\n00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:55.780\nShoot.\nI've got it, how about curl?\n\n140\n00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:57.800\nI've got curl, too.\n\n141\n00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:00.380\nWell [LAUGH] and I've got nano.\n\n142\n00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:02.210\nI'm trying to think of commands\nthat I haven't installed.\n\n143\n00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:04.294\nSo if there's a command that\nyou haven't installed yet,\n\n144\n00:07:04.294 --> 00:07:06.120\nthe man page is probably not there.\n\n145\n00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:10.370\nWhen you install packages, the package is\ninstalling not only the application, but\n\n146\n00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:11.910\nalso the man page for it.\n\n147\n00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:16.050\nSo that's why we're able to pull these\nthings up, so we can look and find them.\n\n148\n00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:19.180\nSome man pages are really, really long.\n\n149\n00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:23.160\nLike if you do man vi,\nthe vi command editor, it's got so\n\n150\n00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:24.308\nmuch stuff that it can do.\n\n151\n00:07:24.308 --> 00:07:28.960\nThis man page, it really goes on for\na while, there is a lot of stuff in here.\n\n152\n00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:32.270\nSome are extremely short,\nif you have a command that's really,\n\n153\n00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:36.320\nreally simple, a command like uptime.\n\n154\n00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:41.030\nThe uptime command, it just shows how\nlong your system has been up for.\n\n155\n00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:45.570\nI can see that I booted this system\nup 37 minutes ago apparently.\n\n156\n00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:48.390\nSo it's been up for 37 minutes,\nand that's it, right.\n\n157\n00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:49.750\nThere's one user logged in.\n\n158\n00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:52.070\nCurrent CPU load average,\nthat's it, right?\n\n159\n00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:55.192\nUptime is a pretty handy command if you\nthink your server might have rebooted or\n\n160\n00:07:55.192 --> 00:07:56.668\nwhatever, you can run this and see.\n\n161\n00:07:56.668 --> 00:08:01.871\nWell, if we look at its man page, there's\nnot all that much we can do with it.\n\n162\n00:08:01.871 --> 00:08:06.856\nSo I get my synopsis, my description,\nthe files involved in it,\n\n163\n00:08:06.856 --> 00:08:10.160\nand the authors and that's it, right?\n\n164\n00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:15.040\nThere's no command tags at all,\nit almost fits in one entire screen,\n\n165\n00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:16.930\nin fact, just a couple lines there above.\n\n166\n00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:21.350\nBut that's it, so simple commands,\na lot of very simple main pages.\n\n167\n00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:25.080\nComplex commands like Vi, they'll\nhave really, really long man pages.\n\n168\n00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:26.830\nIt's a great source of information.\n\n169\n00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:29.840\nSome of the stuff I like\nis down towards the bottom.\n\n170\n00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:34.910\nYou'll see authors, that's great, but\nyou'll also see, see also, that's telling\n\n171\n00:08:34.910 --> 00:08:39.710\nus other commands that are related to up\ntime that we might want to take a look at.\n\n172\n00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:41.840\nSo if we take a look at like ps and top,\n\n173\n00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:43.420\nI'm going to talk about\nthe a little bit later.\n\n174\n00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:44.090\nSo it's saying, hey,\n\n175\n00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:47.160\nthese are other commands you might\nbe interesting in learning about.\n\n176\n00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:52.270\nSo when I did uptime, one of\nthe things it told me was my average\n\n177\n00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:55.335\nload on the system,\nmy CPU and processor load.\n\n178\n00:08:55.335 --> 00:08:57.330\nRight.\nWell, ps and\n\n179\n00:08:57.330 --> 00:09:01.130\ntop are other utilities that help\nme to take a look at that load.\n\n180\n00:09:01.130 --> 00:09:03.160\nAnd they're on my list here somewhere.\n\n181\n00:09:04.385 --> 00:09:07.050\nYeah,so we'll take a look\nat them a little bit later.\n\n182\n00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:11.070\nBut those are just kind of examples\nof the man pages and how they work.\n\n183\n00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:14.170\nSome man pages get even more detailed.\n\n184\n00:09:14.170 --> 00:09:17.370\nSo you get your command\nline modifiers here,\n\n185\n00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:19.340\nall the different extensions you can use.\n\n186\n00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:24.120\nAnd then you'll see your other\ninformation like how to report bugs,\n\n187\n00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:26.970\ncopyright information,\nif it's held under copyright.\n\n188\n00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:29.500\nYou'll see, also, refer to other commands.\n\n189\n00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:32.690\nSometimes you'll see examples\nwhere they actually list example\n\n190\n00:09:32.690 --> 00:09:34.760\nforms of that command that you can use.\n\n191\n00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:38.300\nSo, it's up to whoever the author of that\npage was, what all they choose to include.\n\n192\n00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:39.640\nBut, they're normally pretty extensive.\n\n193\n00:09:43.372 --> 00:09:44.850\nSo, that's the man command.\n\n194\n00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:47.680\nWhenever in doubt, that's the one I\nusually go to for help with a command.\n\n195\n00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:52.580\nAll right,\nanother command I wanna show you is,\n\n196\n00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:55.880\nwhen we installed the package\nthe other day, that package,\n\n197\n00:09:55.880 --> 00:10:00.840\nit was right here on our machine or\nwe pulled it from the Cent OS repository.\n\n198\n00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:05.610\nBut, what if I wanted to install a package\nthat wasn't included with the OS.\n\n199\n00:10:05.610 --> 00:10:07.700\nThen I need to go out and download it.\n\n200\n00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:09.740\nWell normally we fire up a web browser,\nright?\n\n201\n00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:12.500\nWe browse to the website,\nwe click on the package and download it.\n\n202\n00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:15.320\nBut what if you only got\nthe command line interface?\n\n203\n00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:17.370\nIf you just have the CLI.\n\n204\n00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:20.730\nAll right, well from the CLI there\nis a couple of commands we can use.\n\n205\n00:10:20.730 --> 00:10:22.280\nActually ran them just a moment ago.\n\n206\n00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:28.210\nThere's wget, which allows us\nto get a file from a web page.\n\n207\n00:10:28.210 --> 00:10:31.170\nThere's also curl,\nwhich tells the same thing.\n\n208\n00:10:31.170 --> 00:10:34.010\nIt allows us to get some\ncontent from a URL.\n\n209\n00:10:34.010 --> 00:10:34.630\nRight?\n\n210\n00:10:34.630 --> 00:10:38.850\nAnd that URL might be an FTP, or\n\n211\n00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:42.600\nhttp or whatever,\ngives you a little bit more options.\n\n212\n00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:45.510\nSo those two commands are very similar and\n\n213\n00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:49.475\nit let us point out to a website to\nbe able to go and download something.\n\n214\n00:10:49.475 --> 00:10:53.610\nSo, if I knew something off hand,\n\n215\n00:10:53.610 --> 00:10:55.620\nI guess I could have gotten\nsomething before the show.\n\n216\n00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:58.689\nBut basically, you'd say like wget,\n\n217\n00:10:58.689 --> 00:11:03.622\nhttp://itpro.tv/, I'm just\ngonna make something up.\n\n218\n00:11:05.661 --> 00:11:07.525\nSomething like that, right.\n\n219\n00:11:07.525 --> 00:11:09.360\n/files/package.rpm.\n\n220\n00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:12.850\nAnd it would reach out to that website,\nand try and download that file.\n\n221\n00:11:12.850 --> 00:11:17.110\nAnd so it would pull it down, and you'd\nbe able to get that information, right?\n\n222\n00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:18.270\nSo here it's going to try, and\n\n223\n00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:21.150\nit's going to get 404 not found,\ncuz that file doesn't exist.\n\n224\n00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:24.740\nBut that's kinda how\nthe wget command works.\n\n225\n00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:28.708\nReally handy for downloading\na package we can then go and install.\n\n226\n00:11:28.708 --> 00:11:33.250\nSo, pretty useful, one thing we're gonna\nnotice though is that when we go out and\n\n227\n00:11:33.250 --> 00:11:36.740\nwe use wget to download a package,\nsometimes it'll be a straight up package.\n\n228\n00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:39.190\nIt'll be like that, an rpm and\nyou're ready to rock.\n\n229\n00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:39.970\nAll right.\n\n230\n00:11:39.970 --> 00:11:43.780\nOther times though,\nthe file might be archived, right?\n\n231\n00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:46.120\nIt might be a compressed file.\n\n232\n00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:49.260\nAnd let me show you an example of that.\n\n233\n00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:53.100\nSo, I'm running this\nmachine on VMware fusion.\n\n234\n00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:55.680\nAnd so, it's a virtual machine.\n\n235\n00:11:55.680 --> 00:12:00.220\nAnd when you install Cent OS or\nwhatever on VMware fusion,\n\n236\n00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:04.260\nyou need to install what\nare called the VM additions.\n\n237\n00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.170\nRight.\nIt's some additional software that\n\n238\n00:12:06.170 --> 00:12:08.190\nmakes the virtual machine\nparticipate a little bit better,\n\n239\n00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:10.130\nmakes the operating system\nwork better with VMware.\n\n240\n00:12:10.130 --> 00:12:11.250\n>> All right.\n\n241\n00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:13.370\n>> Well they provide you the VM additions,\nbut\n\n242\n00:12:13.370 --> 00:12:17.530\nthey provide them to you\nas a archived file, right.\n\n243\n00:12:17.530 --> 00:12:20.880\nSo let me show you what we\ndo to kinda work with that.\n\n244\n00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:21.380\nHang on.\n\n245\n00:12:22.610 --> 00:12:25.090\nLet me get out of full screen for\na second here.\n\n246\n00:12:25.090 --> 00:12:27.662\nAnd I'm going to insert that CD.\n\n247\n00:12:35.871 --> 00:12:37.030\nAll right.\n\n248\n00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:42.110\nWe're gonna do another episode later on\nthat's gonna cover mounting disks and\n\n249\n00:12:42.110 --> 00:12:43.680\nworking with the file system.\n\n250\n00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:47.838\nBut just real quick here,\nso I can get at this one,\n\n251\n00:12:47.838 --> 00:12:52.496\nlet me cheat real quick here and\njump into a root prompt.\n\n252\n00:13:02.078 --> 00:13:03.730\nThere we go, okay.\n\n253\n00:13:05.710 --> 00:13:08.804\nSo, what I did is I just pop\nthat CD ROM into my computer and\n\n254\n00:13:08.804 --> 00:13:11.787\nit's got the VMware tools and\nI can see it right there.\n\n255\n00:13:11.787 --> 00:13:17.855\nWMwareTools-9.6.2-1688356.tar.gz.\n\n256\n00:13:17.855 --> 00:13:18.865\nOkay.\n\n257\n00:13:18.865 --> 00:13:20.970\nThat is an archive.\n\n258\n00:13:20.970 --> 00:13:24.298\nIt's like a zip file, or an rar, an arj,\n\n259\n00:13:24.298 --> 00:13:29.540\nwhatever archive file that contains\nall the tools that I need.\n\n260\n00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:31.440\nBut, it's archived.\n\n261\n00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:34.420\nIt's all stuck together and\nI need to decompress it.\n\n262\n00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:36.550\nSo what I'm gonna do is,\nI'm going to copy that file.\n\n263\n00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:41.300\nI'm gonna copy that file\nright into my home directory.\n\n264\n00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:42.160\nOkay.\n\n265\n00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:43.410\nSo I'll just copy that over.\n\n266\n00:13:45.550 --> 00:13:48.840\nAnd these are all commands we\ncovered in the episode yesterday.\n\n267\n00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:51.510\nAnd when I look there is\nthe utility sitting right there,\n\n268\n00:13:51.510 --> 00:13:52.820\nVMware tools blah, blah, blah.\n\n269\n00:13:52.820 --> 00:13:53.380\nAll right.\n\n270\n00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:55.080\nBut it's archived,\nI can't do anything with it.\n\n271\n00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:56.450\nIt's compressed.\n\n272\n00:13:56.450 --> 00:13:57.170\nAll right.\n\n273\n00:13:57.170 --> 00:14:00.560\nSo what I can do, is I can unarchive it.\n\n274\n00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:02.550\nI can decompress it.\n\n275\n00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:08.210\nThat gz tells me it was compressed using\ngzip which are the GNU zip utilities.\n\n276\n00:14:08.210 --> 00:14:10.110\nSo I'm gonna decompress it.\n\n277\n00:14:10.110 --> 00:14:11.990\nNow, there's a few commands I can use for\nthat.\n\n278\n00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:16.300\nMost commonly I'm gonna use gzip.\n\n279\n00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:21.040\nAnd the gzip command, it has a couple of\nlittle extensions we can use to modify\n\n280\n00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:25.000\nwhether it's compressing something or\nuncompressing something, right.\n\n281\n00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.314\nSo if you just run gzip by itself it'll\ntell you that you can run gzip-h for help,\n\n282\n00:14:29.314 --> 00:14:30.290\nright.\n\n283\n00:14:30.290 --> 00:14:36.520\nAnd if we take a look at it's help, well\nit was more than what fit on the screen.\n\n284\n00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:41.850\nSo, when we take a look at it's help file\nyou'll see we can do -d to decompress,\n\n285\n00:14:41.850 --> 00:14:45.850\nby default it compresses,\nyou add a -d and it decompresses.\n\n286\n00:14:45.850 --> 00:14:49.650\nSo if I said gzip, and\nthen a file and then, you know,\n\n287\n00:14:49.650 --> 00:14:53.190\nan archive name it will\nactually compress the file and\n\n288\n00:14:53.190 --> 00:14:56.700\nif I do gzip-d in a file it\nwill decompress that file.\n\n289\n00:14:56.700 --> 00:14:57.320\nAll right?\n\n290\n00:14:57.320 --> 00:15:01.770\nSo, I could archive some\nstuff that I already got.\n\n291\n00:15:01.770 --> 00:15:04.750\nSo for example, I got all those\ntext files that we made yesterday.\n\n292\n00:15:04.750 --> 00:15:05.340\nRight?\n\n293\n00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:08.990\nMaybe I want to compress all\nof those into a single file.\n\n294\n00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:10.650\nSo I can use gzip to do that.\n\n295\n00:15:10.650 --> 00:15:16.860\nI can say gzip, and then I need to\nspecify what it is, I want to compress.\n\n296\n00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:20.200\nAnd so I can say like compress file1.txt.\n\n297\n00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:21.520\nRight.\n\n298\n00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:25.276\nIf I run that,\nis there no file one, there isn't.\n\n299\n00:15:25.276 --> 00:15:28.204\n[LAUGH] We'll do index.html.\n\n300\n00:15:31.121 --> 00:15:36.184\nSo if I run gzip index.html,\nit's gonna compress that file and\n\n301\n00:15:36.184 --> 00:15:39.510\nnow I can see I've got index.html.gz.\n\n302\n00:15:39.510 --> 00:15:41.660\nIt's been compressed.\n\n303\n00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:43.800\nAll right.\n\n304\n00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:45.970\nAnd see how I no longer have index.html.\n\n305\n00:15:45.970 --> 00:15:49.210\nIt removed that one, and\nnow I just have the compressed one.\n\n306\n00:15:49.210 --> 00:15:50.810\nNow it's smaller on the hard drive.\n\n307\n00:15:50.810 --> 00:15:51.597\nIt was already really small.\n\n308\n00:15:51.597 --> 00:15:54.152\nIn fact, when you archive really,\nreally small files,\n\n309\n00:15:54.152 --> 00:15:56.986\nwhen you compress them,\nsometimes they actually get bigger.\n\n310\n00:15:56.986 --> 00:16:00.422\nThe compression makes them larger But\n\n311\n00:16:00.422 --> 00:16:06.539\nnow I can run gzip -d index.html.gz,\nand it will decompress it,\n\n312\n00:16:06.539 --> 00:16:11.281\nand when I look now,\nI've got my index.html back.\n\n313\n00:16:11.281 --> 00:16:17.270\nSo gzip and a file will compress it,\ngzip -d and a file will decompress it.\n\n314\n00:16:17.270 --> 00:16:22.848\nNow, most modern Unix or Linux\nsystems will have a built-in alias for\n\n315\n00:16:22.848 --> 00:16:28.610\ngunzip so that you have gzip and\ngunzip, gunzip is just gzip -d.\n\n316\n00:16:28.610 --> 00:16:31.800\nIt's basically like an alias\nthat's put in for it, so\n\n317\n00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:37.080\nI could say gzip index.html,\nand it's compressed, and\n\n318\n00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:42.050\nI can say gunzip index.html.gz,\n\n319\n00:16:42.050 --> 00:16:45.010\nand it will decompress it, all right?\n\n320\n00:16:45.010 --> 00:16:49.242\nIt's just an alias, so gzip -d and\ngunzip, they're the same thing.\n\n321\n00:16:50.702 --> 00:16:55.500\nAll right,\nnow I can use that with the VMware tools.\n\n322\n00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:56.330\nIf I take a look,\n\n323\n00:16:56.330 --> 00:17:01.200\nthe VMware tools right now, I'll use\nthe LAH that we talked about, right?\n\n324\n00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:04.920\nIt's 59 megabytes,\nthat VMware tools file, all right?\n\n325\n00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:11.420\nSo if I do gunzip vmwaretools,\nblah blah blah, right?\n\n326\n00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:14.840\nIt's going to decompress it, and it'll\ntake a little longer than my text file\n\n327\n00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:18.580\na minute ago because this is\na bigger file, and when I do ls-lah,\n\n328\n00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:22.440\nI can see that it's no longer compressed.\n\n329\n00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:27.530\nNow it's 174 megabytes,\nit's considerably larger, all right?\n\n330\n00:17:27.530 --> 00:17:32.330\nBut you might notice the file\nis still red, it ends in .tar,\n\n331\n00:17:32.330 --> 00:17:35.770\nwhich means tape archive, so\nit's actually still an archive.\n\n332\n00:17:35.770 --> 00:17:38.210\nThis one was compressed\ntwo different ways, and so\n\n333\n00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:43.550\nwe'll talk about TAR here in a minute,\nbut right now it's been decompressed,\n\n334\n00:17:43.550 --> 00:17:47.970\nand so now I've got it right\nhere as just 174 megs, right?\n\n335\n00:17:47.970 --> 00:17:53.526\nNow I'm gonna copy that to another\n\n336\n00:17:53.526 --> 00:17:58.323\nfile, let's just do .bak.\n\n337\n00:18:01.741 --> 00:18:02.940\nWell, what do I wanna do here?\n\n338\n00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:07.820\nNo, I'll just leave it, I can always\nget it off the CD again if I need it.\n\n339\n00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:09.900\nAll right, so I've got it right there,\nif I wanna recompress it,\n\n340\n00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:14.420\nI can just do gzip VMWareTools.tar,\nand it'll feed that in there.\n\n341\n00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:16.810\nNow it's compressing it back again, and\n\n342\n00:18:16.810 --> 00:18:20.510\nI should see it go from] 174 megs\ndown to something smaller, right?\n\n343\n00:18:20.510 --> 00:18:24.650\nNow, I don't know how VMware compressed\nthis originally, so the guys there\n\n344\n00:18:24.650 --> 00:18:27.680\nmight have done a much higher level of\ncompression than what I'm doing, so\n\n345\n00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:30.130\nI might not get back to\nthe original 60 megabytes.\n\n346\n00:18:30.130 --> 00:18:33.350\nLet's see if we do,\nwe do 59 megabytes, all right?\n\n347\n00:18:33.350 --> 00:18:36.090\nIt's about the same, so\nnow it's compressed again, and\n\n348\n00:18:36.090 --> 00:18:39.370\nI'll see that file extension has a .gz on\nthe end of it, just like it did before.\n\n349\n00:18:39.370 --> 00:18:46.860\nAll right, now when I decompressed it,\nit became a TAR file, okay?\n\n350\n00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:54.360\nSo I will make a backup of it,\noops, that didn't work, there.\n\n351\n00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:56.510\nI'm just making a backup real quick so\n\n352\n00:18:56.510 --> 00:19:00.050\nthat I've got the compressed\none right here and\n\n353\n00:19:00.050 --> 00:19:05.280\nI've got a copy of it that I just called\n.bak just to have it sit there, all right.\n\n354\n00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:08.990\nAnd what I'm going to do is I'm going\nto decompress VMWare tools again.\n\n355\n00:19:08.990 --> 00:19:13.072\nSo I'll do gunzip VMWaretools.gz.\n\n356\n00:19:13.072 --> 00:19:14.500\nAll right?\n\n357\n00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:17.350\nAnd when I decompress it,\nit's still a TAR file, all right?\n\n358\n00:19:17.350 --> 00:19:18.100\nSo what is T-A-R?\n\n359\n00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:21.110\nWell that's TAR, and\nit stands for tape archive.\n\n360\n00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:25.770\nAnd what it does is it allows\nit to take a bunch of files.\n\n361\n00:19:25.770 --> 00:19:28.400\nAnd basically join them\ntogether into one big file.\n\n362\n00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:31.210\nIt does not do any compression.\n\n363\n00:19:31.210 --> 00:19:33.530\nIt just sticks files together, that's it.\n\n364\n00:19:33.530 --> 00:19:35.970\nSo if I've got 50 megs of files.\n\n365\n00:19:35.970 --> 00:19:39.320\nIf it's like ten five meg files,\nso 50 megs.\n\n366\n00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:42.680\nAnd I use Tar to combine them,\nit creates one 50 meg file.\n\n367\n00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:44.690\nIt doesn't get any smaller.\n\n368\n00:19:44.690 --> 00:19:50.700\nSo a lot of people will combine Tar with\nGzip Tar to combine the files into one,\n\n369\n00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:53.860\nand then gzip to compress them together,\nand that's what VMware did.\n\n370\n00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:54.970\nIt's very common.\n\n371\n00:19:54.970 --> 00:20:00.280\nYou'll normally see it where the file\nends in .tar.gz like we see here,\n\n372\n00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:02.155\nor sometimes you'll see where they end in.\n\n373\n00:20:02.155 --> 00:20:03.145\nTGZ, right.\n\n374\n00:20:03.145 --> 00:20:05.795\nLetting you know there's both,\nTAR and gzip.\n\n375\n00:20:07.225 --> 00:20:09.955\nSo they&nbsp;did that here, they\ncombine all these vowels together, now,\n\n376\n00:20:09.955 --> 00:20:11.335\nwhy would we want to do that?\n\n377\n00:20:11.335 --> 00:20:13.935\nWell, it's easier then trying\nto transmit a bunch of\n\n378\n00:20:13.935 --> 00:20:15.455\nseparate files here they are all combined.\n\n379\n00:20:16.495 --> 00:20:19.895\nThis kind of came from the old tape days,\nwhen you wrote to a tape,\n\n380\n00:20:19.895 --> 00:20:23.275\ntape's didn't know that there was\none file started one file ended.\n\n381\n00:20:23.275 --> 00:20:25.070\nIt was just treated as one big file So,\n\n382\n00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:28.490\nif we were going to write anything\nto tape, we would use tar to do it,\n\n383\n00:20:28.490 --> 00:20:32.780\nand that way it would combine it all on\nto one big file and write it to the tape.\n\n384\n00:20:32.780 --> 00:20:35.860\nSo, tar is capable of figuring\nout where those files end and\n\n385\n00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:38.420\nbreaking them back up into\ntheir individual pieces.\n\n386\n00:20:38.420 --> 00:20:42.520\nSo, this file here, it's a It's\n\n387\n00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:46.500\ngot all of our stuff inside of it right,\nVMWare Tools -9.6.2 blah blah blah, right.\n\n388\n00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:53.780\nI need to untar it, I need to break\nit apart into its individual pieces.\n\n389\n00:20:53.780 --> 00:20:58.950\nSo to do that we use the tar command And\nwe use dash, and\n\n390\n00:20:58.950 --> 00:21:03.020\nthere's two main modes that we use this,\ndash c for\n\n391\n00:21:03.020 --> 00:21:06.890\ncreating an archive, for\ncreating a tar file, all right?\n\n392\n00:21:06.890 --> 00:21:12.620\nAnd then there's dash x for\nextracting an archive, okay?\n\n393\n00:21:12.620 --> 00:21:17.950\nSo, if I do tar-x and then I specify\nthat file it's gonna break it apart.\n\n394\n00:21:17.950 --> 00:21:18.630\nAll right.\n\n395\n00:21:18.630 --> 00:21:22.608\nNow, what I normally do is combine it\nwith two other tags, which is v and f.\n\n396\n00:21:22.608 --> 00:21:28.420\nSo tar -x that means I'm\nextracting a tar file.\n\n397\n00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:32.120\nThe v means give me verbose output,\nlet me see what's going on,\n\n398\n00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:33.940\notherwise you don't see what's happening.\n\n399\n00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:37.270\nAnd the f says, I'm going to give\nyou the filename right here.\n\n400\n00:21:37.270 --> 00:21:37.810\nOkay.\n\n401\n00:21:37.810 --> 00:21:39.520\nAnd then I provide it with the file name.\n\n402\n00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:41.330\nThe file name I want to extract.\n\n403\n00:21:41.330 --> 00:21:44.540\nAnd I'm going to say, basically,\nextract this par file.\n\n404\n00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:48.530\nAll right?\nAnd when I run it, there it goes,\n\n405\n00:21:48.530 --> 00:21:49.840\nI get a lot of screen up.\n\n406\n00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:53.650\nWhat it's showing me is it's breaking\nevery file out of that archive, and\n\n407\n00:21:53.650 --> 00:21:59.680\nwhen it's done Now I should have a folder\nthat has the data that was attracted.\n\n408\n00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:05.640\nAnd when I do an ls I can see right there\nI've got a vmware-tools-distrib folder.\n\n409\n00:22:06.650 --> 00:22:12.300\nAnd when I go into that,\nhere's my VMwareTools, okay?\n\n410\n00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:16.470\nThey're right here, I can run that\nPerl script and start the install, and\n\n411\n00:22:16.470 --> 00:22:18.090\nwe'll have the VMwareTools installed.\n\n412\n00:22:18.090 --> 00:22:18.770\nAll right.\n\n413\n00:22:18.770 --> 00:22:21.250\nSo that's extracting the tar file.\n\n414\n00:22:21.250 --> 00:22:21.750\nOkay.\n\n415\n00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:25.670\nIf I want to create a tar file.\n\n416\n00:22:26.870 --> 00:22:31.620\nAll I have to do to create one is\ninstead of doing x v f I say c v f.\n\n417\n00:22:31.620 --> 00:22:34.380\nAnd I want to specify\nwhat I want to tar up.\n\n418\n00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:37.570\nSo I can say tar dash c v f.\n\n419\n00:22:37.570 --> 00:22:40.730\nAnd then I can specify what\nit is that I want to tar.\n\n420\n00:22:40.730 --> 00:22:47.520\nSo maybe I want to tar that VMware tools\ndistrib folder that we just created.\n\n421\n00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:48.420\nWhen I run that.\n\n422\n00:22:50.035 --> 00:22:51.215\nLet's see.\n\n423\n00:22:51.215 --> 00:22:52.915\nRefusing to create an empty,\nyou know what?\n\n424\n00:22:52.915 --> 00:22:54.855\nI probably need to do slash star.\n\n425\n00:22:54.855 --> 00:22:57.725\nI want to get all of the stuff\nthat's inside of there, right?\n\n426\n00:22:57.725 --> 00:23:00.665\nWhen I said slash,\njust trying to targ just that folder so\n\n427\n00:23:00.665 --> 00:23:03.062\nI just need to give it\na little star there.\n\n428\n00:23:03.062 --> 00:23:06.292\nNo, you know, you're still not happy.\n\n429\n00:23:06.292 --> 00:23:10.062\nWhat a, [LAUGH] so I am,\nI'm forgetting something here.\n\n430\n00:23:10.062 --> 00:23:12.992\nSo I need to tell what I want\nthe file name of the archive to be.\n\n431\n00:23:12.992 --> 00:23:15.552\nSo I'm telling the folder I wanna back up.\n\n432\n00:23:15.552 --> 00:23:17.870\nThat's great But\nI need to tell it the file name, so\n\n433\n00:23:17.870 --> 00:23:23.890\nI'm gonna call it vmwaretools.tar,\nthat'll help.\n\n434\n00:23:23.890 --> 00:23:26.710\nSo I'm giving it the file name\nthat I want it to be, and\n\n435\n00:23:26.710 --> 00:23:28.860\nthen I'm specifying the folder\nthat I wanna back up.\n\n436\n00:23:28.860 --> 00:23:31.010\nAnd when I run that, there we go.\n\n437\n00:23:31.010 --> 00:23:31.545\nThat'll help it.\n\n438\n00:23:31.545 --> 00:23:35.090\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I like how it says cowardly refusing to\n\n439\n00:23:35.090 --> 00:23:36.704\ncreate it\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n440\n00:23:36.704 --> 00:23:37.670\n>> Yeah, yeah.\n\n441\n00:23:37.670 --> 00:23:39.913\nYeah, it caught me.\nAll right, so now when I look,\n\n442\n00:23:39.913 --> 00:23:43.663\nI just created vmwaretools.tar,\nI can see it right there.\n\n443\n00:23:43.663 --> 00:23:46.944\nThat's a wrap up of everything\nthat's in this vmware tools\n\n444\n00:23:46.944 --> 00:23:50.028\ndistrib folder is in there,\nand the command that I ran,\n\n445\n00:23:50.028 --> 00:23:52.995\nlet me just bring it back up again,\nworked like this.\n\n446\n00:23:52.995 --> 00:23:54.167\nTar, right?\n\n447\n00:23:54.167 --> 00:23:55.328\nI'm calling the command.\n\n448\n00:23:55.328 --> 00:23:58.358\nDash cvf I'm creating an archive, right?\n\n449\n00:23:58.358 --> 00:24:03.819\nI'm gonna do Verbose Output, and the file\nname I'm creating is vmwaretools.tar.\n\n450\n00:24:03.819 --> 00:24:05.886\nAnd then the stuff I wanna go into it,\n\n451\n00:24:05.886 --> 00:24:09.510\nwell I point it to that\nvmware-tools-distrib folder, okay?\n\n452\n00:24:09.510 --> 00:24:12.130\nAnd then you can do an asterisk\non the end if you want, but\n\n453\n00:24:12.130 --> 00:24:13.330\nI specified to the folder itself.\n\n454\n00:24:13.330 --> 00:24:17.870\nSo it grabbed it and everything inside\nof it and made that tar file, right?\n\n455\n00:24:17.870 --> 00:24:21.420\nWhen we extracted it,\nit kinda made its own folder.\n\n456\n00:24:21.420 --> 00:24:27.860\nWe could have gone a little bit\nfurther and said like tar -xvf and\n\n457\n00:24:27.860 --> 00:24:33.190\nI'll extract that vmwaretools.tar file,\nright?\n\n458\n00:24:33.190 --> 00:24:37.900\nAnd by default when you extract it, you're\nassuming whoever made it, created a file\n\n459\n00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:41.470\ninside of there and everything is nice and\nneat in there, but sometimes people don't.\n\n460\n00:24:41.470 --> 00:24:43.670\nAnd you extract this and\nall of a sudden in your user folder,\n\n461\n00:24:43.670 --> 00:24:46.600\nyou got a ton of files just\njunked up right in there, right?\n\n462\n00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:51.445\nSo sometimes it's nice to go ahead and\ndo a -c and add a folder name.\n\n463\n00:24:51.445 --> 00:24:56.370\nAnd say when you extract it, I want you\nto extract it into this folder, right?\n\n464\n00:24:56.370 --> 00:24:57.680\nAnd then that way when it does it,\n\n465\n00:24:57.680 --> 00:25:00.598\nI probably need to create\nthe folder first, there we go.\n\n466\n00:25:00.598 --> 00:25:04.210\nAnd then, when we extract it,\nit's gonna extract all these files, but\n\n467\n00:25:04.210 --> 00:25:06.240\ninstead of throwing them\nright into my home directory,\n\n468\n00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:08.890\nit's gonna throw them into\nthis folder that I created.\n\n469\n00:25:08.890 --> 00:25:12.780\nSo if I change into the folder,\nfolder there it is.\n\n470\n00:25:12.780 --> 00:25:16.640\nThere's vmware-tools-distrib and\neverything that's inside of there.\n\n471\n00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:21.540\nSo that's helpful if you just don't know\nif the author created subfolders or not.\n\n472\n00:25:21.540 --> 00:25:26.110\nI hate it when I extract something and\nmy home folder's all junked up now.\n\n473\n00:25:26.110 --> 00:25:28.129\nAll right now,\nyou might ask yourself well,\n\n474\n00:25:28.129 --> 00:25:31.068\nthat seemed kinda convoluted that\nwe gotta go through two steps.\n\n475\n00:25:31.068 --> 00:25:34.850\nThat they tar'ed it and\nthey gzip'ed it and it's a mess.\n\n476\n00:25:34.850 --> 00:25:37.350\nWell, this is extremely common.\n\n477\n00:25:37.350 --> 00:25:41.820\nThis is the most common way that people\ndistribute files is tar and gzip.\n\n478\n00:25:41.820 --> 00:25:45.860\nAnd so, tar actually has one more\nextension that's useful which is the z\n\n479\n00:25:45.860 --> 00:25:47.140\nextension.\n\n480\n00:25:47.140 --> 00:25:49.930\nAnd that says when you use\nthe z command line modifier,\n\n481\n00:25:49.930 --> 00:25:52.560\nit says filter this through gzip.\n\n482\n00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:55.611\nAnd so you can do both at the same time.\n\n483\n00:25:55.611 --> 00:25:57.092\nAll right, let me show you.\n\n484\n00:25:57.092 --> 00:26:01.986\nLet me clean up my directory a little bit.\n\n485\n00:26:01.986 --> 00:26:06.434\nSo let me do an rm to remove, -rf, so\n\n486\n00:26:06.434 --> 00:26:12.320\n-r means be recursive,\nget subfolders, too.\n\n487\n00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:15.604\nAnd f means force, so even if it's like\na read-only file I'll still try and\n\n488\n00:26:15.604 --> 00:26:17.100\nforce the deletion.\n\n489\n00:26:17.100 --> 00:26:21.840\nAnd so I'm gonna force a removal of the\nfolder folder that I made a moment ago.\n\n490\n00:26:22.990 --> 00:26:29.569\nAnd let's get rid of\nthe vmware-tools-distrib folder.\n\n491\n00:26:29.569 --> 00:26:31.570\nI'm just trying to clean up my mess.\n\n492\n00:26:31.570 --> 00:26:35.350\nAnd I'm gonna remove any\n*.tar file that I've got.\n\n493\n00:26:35.350 --> 00:26:43.276\nWhoops, shoot just get rid of that and\nwhat's left?\n\n494\n00:26:43.276 --> 00:26:45.950\nAll that's left is that\nback up file that I made.\n\n495\n00:26:45.950 --> 00:26:50.420\nSo I want to rename that backup\nfile to be not a backup.\n\n496\n00:26:52.585 --> 00:26:53.085\nThat didn't work.\n\n497\n00:26:55.505 --> 00:26:56.486\nDon't I have permissions to it?\n\n498\n00:27:01.362 --> 00:27:02.345\nThere, all right.\n\n499\n00:27:02.345 --> 00:27:05.160\nSo now I'm back to the original\narchive that VMWare gave us.\n\n500\n00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:08.750\nAnd you can see where it ends in .tar.gz.\n\n501\n00:27:08.750 --> 00:27:11.140\nWe can use the tar command.\n\n502\n00:27:11.140 --> 00:27:17.270\nAnd remember, I did -xvf, to extract,\nwell, I can say -xvfz or,\n\n503\n00:27:17.270 --> 00:27:21.610\nyou'll usually say xzvf, or whatever,\nthe order doesn't actually matter.\n\n504\n00:27:21.610 --> 00:27:23.430\nBut we'll specify that.\n\n505\n00:27:23.430 --> 00:27:26.930\nAnd what we're doing is we're saying\nextract it, give me verbose output.\n\n506\n00:27:26.930 --> 00:27:31.250\nI'm gonna give you the file name and\nz filter it through gzip.\n\n507\n00:27:31.250 --> 00:27:34.410\nAnd this works both ways when you're,\nwhen you're taring something or\n\n508\n00:27:34.410 --> 00:27:35.780\nyou're untaring it.\n\n509\n00:27:35.780 --> 00:27:40.190\nSo, I'm extracting,\nI'm untaring that VMware file and\n\n510\n00:27:40.190 --> 00:27:42.480\nit's going to do both steps for me.\n\n511\n00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:48.540\nIt's going to decompress it, and filter\nit through tar or filter through gzip.\n\n512\n00:27:48.540 --> 00:27:50.070\nWell it's going to do both.\n\n513\n00:27:50.070 --> 00:27:54.690\nSo there it goes, churning through,\nknocking out both at the same time.\n\n514\n00:27:54.690 --> 00:28:00.520\nI don't have to go through two steps,\nit's all done in one.\n\n515\n00:28:02.550 --> 00:28:06.550\nSo that command again,\nlet me just bring it back here at the top,\n\n516\n00:28:06.550 --> 00:28:11.210\nlet me get into a smaller prompt.\n\n517\n00:28:11.210 --> 00:28:15.652\nSo there's the command that I ran,\n\n518\n00:28:15.652 --> 00:28:22.027\ntar -xzvf VMwareTools and\nthen it did both steps.\n\n519\n00:28:22.027 --> 00:28:26.086\nSo, if you're going to be installing\nthird party software, you may use Wget or\n\n520\n00:28:26.086 --> 00:28:30.280\ncURL to reach out and download that file\nand then you'll use tar to decompress it.\n\n521\n00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:31.530\nAnd now, you're ready to work with it.\n\n522\n00:28:31.530 --> 00:28:35.640\nSo that's a pretty common\nscenario right there.\n\n523\n00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:36.943\nAll right, well I've got a bunch of other.\n\n524\n00:28:36.943 --> 00:28:38.250\n>> Yes.\n>> Commands to talk about.\n\n525\n00:28:38.250 --> 00:28:39.100\nMy laundry list,\n\n526\n00:28:39.100 --> 00:28:42.665\nI think I\"ve only made it halfway through\npage one of my three pages of notes.\n\n527\n00:28:42.665 --> 00:28:44.990\n[LAUGH] So\nwe've got a ton more to get through.\n\n528\n00:28:44.990 --> 00:28:47.570\nThey're really good stuff though, the\nthings that we're gonna be making use of,\n\n529\n00:28:47.570 --> 00:28:49.440\nso we definitely want to know.\n\n530\n00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:53.740\nAnd like always, I am gonna post\nmy show notes with the show,\n\n531\n00:28:53.740 --> 00:28:55.720\nwell maybe not with my scribbles on it,\nbut\n\n532\n00:28:55.720 --> 00:29:00.180\nI'll post this stuff alongside this show,\nwhen you go to watch it on the website.\n\n533\n00:29:00.180 --> 00:29:03.080\nSo you don't have to jot them\nall down if you don't want to.\n\n534\n00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:06.237\nAll right, well stay tuned,\nwe'll be back after this\n\n535\n00:29:06.237 --> 00:29:14.111\n[MUSIC]\n\n536\n00:29:14.111 --> 00:29:15.735\nAll right, welcome back everybody.\n\n537\n00:29:15.735 --> 00:29:18.970\nSo what we're gonna do now,\nis we're gonna change gears and we're\n\n538\n00:29:18.970 --> 00:29:22.737\ngonna take a look at some commands that\nlet us monitor the health of our system.\n\n539\n00:29:22.737 --> 00:29:25.302\nIt's inevitable that when you\nhave a computer, a server,\n\n540\n00:29:25.302 --> 00:29:28.175\nwhatever there's gonna be days\nwhere it feels like it's slow, or\n\n541\n00:29:28.175 --> 00:29:31.277\nyou just want to know what's going\non in the background on that system.\n\n542\n00:29:31.277 --> 00:29:34.180\nAnd so there's a handful of utilities\nthat can help us with that.\n\n543\n00:29:34.180 --> 00:29:36.986\nI already showed one of them that\nI like to use which is Uptime.\n\n544\n00:29:36.986 --> 00:29:39.370\nI use Uptime all the time.\n\n545\n00:29:39.370 --> 00:29:44.360\nAnytime I wonder has a machine been\nrunning for a long time, did it reboot\n\n546\n00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:47.710\nmysteriously last night while I wasn't at\nthe office and I just don't know about it?\n\n547\n00:29:47.710 --> 00:29:49.900\nThe Uptime time utility\nis really handy for that.\n\n548\n00:29:49.900 --> 00:29:53.640\nAnd a syntax is super easy,\nyou just type uptime.\n\n549\n00:29:53.640 --> 00:29:54.475\n>> Updog?\n\n550\n00:29:54.475 --> 00:29:57.160\n[LAUGH]\n>> It's the old joke.\n\n551\n00:29:57.160 --> 00:29:59.027\nIt smells like updog in here.\n\n552\n00:29:59.027 --> 00:30:01.445\n>> What's up dog?\n\n553\n00:30:01.445 --> 00:30:03.060\n>> Not much Ronnie what's up with you?\n\n554\n00:30:03.060 --> 00:30:05.505\nAnyhow, our sad little joke for the day.\n\n555\n00:30:05.505 --> 00:30:10.590\n[LAUGH] So any uptime is a good one,\nI already used it earlier.\n\n556\n00:30:10.590 --> 00:30:13.755\nSome of the other ones that I use,\nuname, all right?\n\n557\n00:30:13.755 --> 00:30:16.740\nUname is a neat little utility.\n\n558\n00:30:16.740 --> 00:30:21.640\nWhen you are remoting into a server, you\nknow it's running Linux when you log in.\n\n559\n00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:22.630\nWell, I guess maybe not.\n\n560\n00:30:22.630 --> 00:30:26.320\nMaybe if you log in and you get a bash\nprompt it might be somewhat ambiguous.\n\n561\n00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:31.694\nYou might be on a BSD machine,\nyou might be on a Solaris box.\n\n562\n00:30:31.694 --> 00:30:35.681\nBecause they all use the GNU utilities,\nthey all use the same bash prompt,\n\n563\n00:30:35.681 --> 00:30:37.060\nyou may not know.\n\n564\n00:30:37.060 --> 00:30:39.480\nAnd so how do you know which\ntype of system you're on,\n\n565\n00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:41.940\nwell that's where uname command comes in.\n\n566\n00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:44.710\nNow, uname by itself is\nnot terribly useful.\n\n567\n00:30:44.710 --> 00:30:46.400\nLet me show you what I mean.\n\n568\n00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:50.777\nHere on my machine I'm just going to run\nuname and it tells me I'm running Linux.\n\n569\n00:30:50.777 --> 00:30:54.389\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Just to contrast this on my laptop,\n\n570\n00:30:54.389 --> 00:30:55.750\nI'm on a Mac.\n\n571\n00:30:55.750 --> 00:30:57.210\nYou guys can make fun of me later.\n\n572\n00:30:57.210 --> 00:31:01.370\nAnd if I run uname on it,\nit comes back and says Darwin, right?\n\n573\n00:31:01.370 --> 00:31:05.070\nWhich, when Mac OS switched\nfrom proprietary over\n\n574\n00:31:05.070 --> 00:31:06.960\nto BSD they called it Darwin.\n\n575\n00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:11.280\nSo that gives us a general\nidea of what our system is.\n\n576\n00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:14.270\nSo if I'm on a BSD system,\nI would see BSD.\n\n577\n00:31:14.270 --> 00:31:16.090\nIf I'm on Linux, I see Linux.\n\n578\n00:31:16.090 --> 00:31:19.000\nSo now that kinda helps me decipher\nwhat the underlying OS is.\n\n579\n00:31:20.010 --> 00:31:23.474\nBut what I normally run is uname -a.\n\n580\n00:31:24.610 --> 00:31:28.260\nThat'll show a lot more\ninformation about your system.\n\n581\n00:31:28.260 --> 00:31:31.210\nIt tells you Linux, right there at\nthe beginning, but it also tells you\n\n582\n00:31:31.210 --> 00:31:35.400\nthe host name, it tells you the version\nof the kernel that you're running.\n\n583\n00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:37.777\nSo I'm running 2.6.32.\n\n584\n00:31:37.777 --> 00:31:40.535\nAnd you can tell whether you're 32 bit or\n64 bit, and\n\n585\n00:31:40.535 --> 00:31:43.240\nI can see I'm running the 64 bit.\n\n586\n00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:46.824\nThat I've got a multi processors support,\nthe SMP.\n\n587\n00:31:46.824 --> 00:31:51.224\nAnd the date as far as this computer\nis concern which is completely wrong.\n\n588\n00:31:51.224 --> 00:31:54.150\nIt thinks that it's May 7th\n>> Yeah.\n\n589\n00:31:54.150 --> 00:31:54.823\nMine too?\n\n590\n00:31:54.823 --> 00:31:55.531\n>> Why does it think that?\n\n591\n00:31:55.531 --> 00:31:57.552\nWell anyhow, so my date's wrong.\n\n592\n00:31:57.552 --> 00:31:58.433\nI'll have to fix that.\n\n593\n00:31:58.433 --> 00:32:02.435\nBut you see that basic information\na little bit more detailed here for\n\n594\n00:32:02.435 --> 00:32:06.820\nus that we can kind of get an idea of\nwhat the system is like, all right?\n\n595\n00:32:06.820 --> 00:32:10.930\nNow, notice it doesn't say sent OS,\nall right.\n\n596\n00:32:10.930 --> 00:32:14.940\nUname does not reflect\nthe distribution that you're running,\n\n597\n00:32:14.940 --> 00:32:20.720\nit reflects the kernel, the actual\nheart of the operating system, okay.\n\n598\n00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:25.650\nSo it doesn't say I'm running CentOS or\nDebian or whatever, for that, well\n\n599\n00:32:25.650 --> 00:32:29.540\nit's up to the distro, different distros\nrepresent themselves different ways.\n\n600\n00:32:29.540 --> 00:32:30.980\nLet me see if i can remember.\n\n601\n00:32:30.980 --> 00:32:35.220\nOn CentOS and Redhat, I think\nthere's a releases folder under etc.\n\n602\n00:32:35.220 --> 00:32:42.230\nLet me just see if I'm right, here.\n\n603\n00:32:42.230 --> 00:32:43.610\nNo, I guess not.\n\n604\n00:32:43.610 --> 00:32:48.800\nSo somewhere there is a release\nfile that you can find.\n\n605\n00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:50.142\nI don't remember where it is, and\n\n606\n00:32:50.142 --> 00:32:52.658\nit will tell you that you're\nrunning CentOS version whatever.\n\n607\n00:32:52.658 --> 00:32:55.723\nBut there's not like a command that you\ncan do, it's part of the distribution,\n\n608\n00:32:55.723 --> 00:32:58.606\nwhen they installed they just happened\nto create this file that lets you know\n\n609\n00:32:58.606 --> 00:33:00.481\ndifferent distributions\nhave different ones.\n\n610\n00:33:00.481 --> 00:33:07.470\nSo uname is just telling you about the OS\nitself, the kernel and what it is.\n\n611\n00:33:07.470 --> 00:33:12.390\nIf I go back to my Mac and\nI run uname, uname -a,\n\n612\n00:33:12.390 --> 00:33:17.650\nI can see Darwin and this is Don's MacBook\nPro and I can see that I'm running 13.2.0,\n\n613\n00:33:17.650 --> 00:33:23.940\nnow that's not all that meaningful\nto me cuz I'm running OSX10.9.2.\n\n614\n00:33:23.940 --> 00:33:28.560\nSo this is the kernel version, not the OS\nversion, and again, it doesn't tell\n\n615\n00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:33.120\nme that I'm running 10.9.2, which I'm sure\nhas some code name that I don't know.\n\n616\n00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:34.932\nActually I do know, it's Mavericks, right?\n\n617\n00:33:34.932 --> 00:33:36.622\n[CROSSTALK] But it doesn't say that here,\nso I don't know.\n\n618\n00:33:36.622 --> 00:33:37.420\n>> Yeah.\n\n619\n00:33:37.420 --> 00:33:41.870\n>> But I can see that I'm 64 bit and\nbasic information there.\n\n620\n00:33:41.870 --> 00:33:42.700\nAnd the clock is right.\n\n621\n00:33:42.700 --> 00:33:43.940\nNo the clock is wrong on this one too,\n\n622\n00:33:43.940 --> 00:33:47.130\nApril 17th, that must be\nthe compile time for the kernel.\n\n623\n00:33:47.130 --> 00:33:48.620\nNot the actual date.\n\n624\n00:33:48.620 --> 00:33:52.030\nSo this one must have been compiled\non April 17th versus here,\n\n625\n00:33:52.030 --> 00:33:53.890\nthis one was compiled on May 7th.\n\n626\n00:33:53.890 --> 00:33:56.520\nAll right so\nbasic information about our system so\n\n627\n00:33:56.520 --> 00:34:00.200\nwe can find out what's going on there,\nall right.\n\n628\n00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:01.920\nSome other commands that we can use.\n\n629\n00:34:03.100 --> 00:34:06.360\nDuring the installation,\nwe created a hard drive, right?\n\n630\n00:34:06.360 --> 00:34:09.340\nWe formatted our hard drive\nto install Linux to it.\n\n631\n00:34:09.340 --> 00:34:12.320\nAnd we might want to know\nhow much space we have.\n\n632\n00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:13.580\nHow much free space we have.\n\n633\n00:34:13.580 --> 00:34:15.930\nThis is something that's particularly\nchallenging for Windows users,\n\n634\n00:34:15.930 --> 00:34:19.910\nbecause Windows users are used to just\ndoing, like, a directory command, and\n\n635\n00:34:19.910 --> 00:34:22.610\nseeing that free space\nright at the end of it.\n\n636\n00:34:22.610 --> 00:34:24.480\nWell, -ls doesn't do that.\n\n637\n00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:26.620\nIt shows what's in that directory, but\n\n638\n00:34:26.620 --> 00:34:28.820\nit doesn't give you any information\nabout the rest of the drive.\n\n639\n00:34:28.820 --> 00:34:31.080\nAnd that's cuz we don't need it,\nwe have a different command for it.\n\n640\n00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:34.230\nWe have the df utility, all right.\n\n641\n00:34:34.230 --> 00:34:38.590\ndf, run by itself will give you\na profile of your disks, right.\n\n642\n00:34:38.590 --> 00:34:40.730\nAnd it'll show you\nexactly how big they are,\n\n643\n00:34:40.730 --> 00:34:43.000\nand how much space is in them, and so on.\n\n644\n00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:49.998\nIt does list it in blocks, in 1K blocks,\nwhich is a little bit weird.\n\n645\n00:34:49.998 --> 00:34:53.078\nIt's a strange way to represent the sizes.\n\n646\n00:34:53.078 --> 00:34:54.383\nSo when you look at this stuff,\n\n647\n00:34:54.383 --> 00:34:56.800\nthe numbers might not make\na whole lot of sense.\n\n648\n00:34:56.800 --> 00:34:59.430\nSo I rarely run df by itself.\n\n649\n00:34:59.430 --> 00:35:04.030\nI normally combine that\nwith the -h modifier,\n\n650\n00:35:04.030 --> 00:35:06.230\nwhich says, make this human readable.\n\n651\n00:35:06.230 --> 00:35:07.810\nPut these in numbers\nthat I can understand.\n\n652\n00:35:07.810 --> 00:35:12.530\nAnd when you do that, now, it throws it\ninto something a little more logical.\n\n653\n00:35:12.530 --> 00:35:18.600\nSo I can see up here, you get a line\nthat shows what each column represents,\n\n654\n00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:22.480\nand then I can see my first drive\nhere which is the mounted on,\n\n655\n00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:23.380\nis what we normally care about.\n\n656\n00:35:23.380 --> 00:35:28.020\nSo /, that's my main drive,\nit is 18 gigs in size,\n\n657\n00:35:28.020 --> 00:35:33.810\nI'm using 2.9 gigs, I've got 14 gigs\navailable, I'm using 18% of it.\n\n658\n00:35:33.810 --> 00:35:36.910\nAll right, and then I can see some of\nthese other mount points that I've got,\n\n659\n00:35:36.910 --> 00:35:38.400\nthe temporary file systems,\n\n660\n00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:42.680\nmy boot partition,\nwhich is also created during set up.\n\n661\n00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:45.330\nAnd I've mounted a CD Rom drive.\n\n662\n00:35:45.330 --> 00:35:48.850\nSo I can see that CD Rom drive so\nit's 61 megs in size.\n\n663\n00:35:48.850 --> 00:35:51.510\nAvailable zero cuz you can't\nwrite to it right it's not\n\n664\n00:35:51.510 --> 00:35:53.100\nlike rewritable or anything.\n\n665\n00:35:53.100 --> 00:35:57.280\nSo you'll see that information here, and\nit gives you that gauge that idea of\n\n666\n00:35:57.280 --> 00:36:01.040\nhow much space you've got\navailable quick and easy.\n\n667\n00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:03.940\nIn the next episode we're gonna\nbe working with discs and\n\n668\n00:36:03.940 --> 00:36:06.860\nwe're gonna you know add some more hard\ndrives and create some partitions and\n\n669\n00:36:06.860 --> 00:36:09.600\nstuff and we'll come back to\nthis df command as we do that.\n\n670\n00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:12.130\nBecause once they're\nmounted you can see them.\n\n671\n00:36:12.130 --> 00:36:16.870\nOne thing about the df command, it does\nnot show you drives that aren't mounted.\n\n672\n00:36:16.870 --> 00:36:19.990\nSo if you haven't actually\nattached a drive to a folder path,\n\n673\n00:36:19.990 --> 00:36:21.530\nyou're not gonna see it in here.\n\n674\n00:36:21.530 --> 00:36:23.890\nThis machine actually has\nthree more hard drives in it,\n\n675\n00:36:23.890 --> 00:36:26.250\nthat I just haven't,\nhaven't even formatted yet.\n\n676\n00:36:26.250 --> 00:36:29.220\nThey don't show up on here\nuntil you format them.\n\n677\n00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:31.780\nPut a partition on them, well,\nyou've got to do the partition first,\n\n678\n00:36:31.780 --> 00:36:32.790\nthen format them.\n\n679\n00:36:32.790 --> 00:36:33.980\nThen mount them to the drive.\n\n680\n00:36:33.980 --> 00:36:35.472\nThat's when they'll show up here.\n\n681\n00:36:35.472 --> 00:36:38.040\nAll right, so it's not necessarily\nrepresentation of hardware,\n\n682\n00:36:38.040 --> 00:36:39.870\nit's a representation of partitions.\n\n683\n00:36:41.120 --> 00:36:42.810\nAll right, so df is a good one.\n\n684\n00:36:42.810 --> 00:36:46.010\nNow that's how much\navailable disk space I have.\n\n685\n00:36:46.010 --> 00:36:47.100\nWhat about RAM?\n\n686\n00:36:47.100 --> 00:36:48.000\nRAM is another one.\n\n687\n00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:50.330\nI wanna know how much\nmemory I have available.\n\n688\n00:36:50.330 --> 00:36:53.770\nAnd there's a cool command for\nthat which is just, free, right?\n\n689\n00:36:53.770 --> 00:36:55.780\nThis used to show your free memory, right,\n\n690\n00:36:55.780 --> 00:36:58.840\nhow much memory I have that's\nfree on the system, all right?\n\n691\n00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:00.750\nAnd we can just run free by itself.\n\n692\n00:37:00.750 --> 00:37:04.430\nAnd it shows us, again, the numbers\nmight not necessarily be human readable.\n\n693\n00:37:04.430 --> 00:37:06.610\nUnfortunately it's not -h on this one,\n\n694\n00:37:06.610 --> 00:37:11.640\nit's -m which actually means\nshow me the memory in megabytes.\n\n695\n00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:13.570\nYou could do it in -k\nto see it in kilobytes.\n\n696\n00:37:13.570 --> 00:37:15.700\nSo you got various modifiers there.\n\n697\n00:37:15.700 --> 00:37:19.290\nBut I'm gonna say show me\nthe data in megabytes.\n\n698\n00:37:19.290 --> 00:37:26.728\nAnd so I can see that my system has about\n2 gigs of RAM, right, 1,869 megabits.\n\n699\n00:37:26.728 --> 00:37:32.306\nI'm using 896, and\nthat means I've got 972 free, all right?\n\n700\n00:37:32.306 --> 00:37:36.930\nSo right now I'm using about\nhalf my memory on this system.\n\n701\n00:37:36.930 --> 00:37:39.600\nI can also see my swap file down here.\n\n702\n00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:41.550\nI've got a 2 gigabyte swap file.\n\n703\n00:37:41.550 --> 00:37:45.200\nRight now I'm not using it at all,\nand that's a good sign, right?\n\n704\n00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:47.860\nIn real life land,\na workstation's one thing but\n\n705\n00:37:47.860 --> 00:37:51.520\non a server your swap file\nshould almost always be 0.\n\n706\n00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:54.820\nIf you see your swap file bigger than\nthat, that means at some point you\n\n707\n00:37:54.820 --> 00:37:58.750\nran out of RAM and had to start using\nyour swap file for extra memory.\n\n708\n00:37:58.750 --> 00:38:00.520\nThat means you need to\nupgrade that server.\n\n709\n00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:04.425\nSo a quick, easy way to see that,\nright here, with free -m.\n\n710\n00:38:05.590 --> 00:38:08.510\nYou also have things like shared memory,\nbuffers, and cached,\n\n711\n00:38:08.510 --> 00:38:10.200\nyou'll see information on that.\n\n712\n00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:14.320\nIf you're running a lot of software that\ninteracts, that can address shared memory,\n\n713\n00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:17.630\nor is using buffers,\nyou'll see those numbers crank up.\n\n714\n00:38:17.630 --> 00:38:21.070\nBut in my case, there's not a whole\nheck of a lot going on here.\n\n715\n00:38:21.070 --> 00:38:25.420\nNow that cached value over here,\nthis is kind of important.\n\n716\n00:38:25.420 --> 00:38:28.413\nWhen I look at these numbers, it looks\nlike I'm using about half my memory.\n\n717\n00:38:28.413 --> 00:38:34.596\nI'm using about 900 megabytes\nof my 1,869 total, okay.\n\n718\n00:38:34.596 --> 00:38:37.110\nSo it looks like I'm about half used,\nright?\n\n719\n00:38:37.110 --> 00:38:41.190\nBut if I look over here I've got\n697 megabytes cached, right?\n\n720\n00:38:42.490 --> 00:38:45.010\nThat means of the 896 megs I'm using,\n\n721\n00:38:45.010 --> 00:38:50.530\n697 is just cached stuff the system\nthinks I might need again.\n\n722\n00:38:50.530 --> 00:38:53.350\nOkay, it doesn't mean I'm\nactually working with it,\n\n723\n00:38:53.350 --> 00:38:55.060\nI'm just sitting here to command line.\n\n724\n00:38:55.060 --> 00:38:57.790\nSo if I subtracted that\nout I'm actually only\n\n725\n00:38:57.790 --> 00:39:01.660\nusing up 200 megabytes of memory right now\nto run Linux on this system on my laptop.\n\n726\n00:39:01.660 --> 00:39:06.335\nRight so just because it looks like I'm at\nhalf doesn't mean I'm actually at half,\n\n727\n00:39:06.335 --> 00:39:07.995\nI've got to take that cache into account.\n\n728\n00:39:09.675 --> 00:39:13.925\nAll right, so df shows us our disc free.\n\n729\n00:39:13.925 --> 00:39:16.377\nRight, that's showing\nthe disc utilization.\n\n730\n00:39:16.377 --> 00:39:19.027\nFree shows us our free memory, right?\n\n731\n00:39:19.027 --> 00:39:22.367\nAnd we use -h with df to\nmake it human readable.\n\n732\n00:39:22.367 --> 00:39:24.853\nI used -m here just to go to megabytes.\n\n733\n00:39:24.853 --> 00:39:26.373\nSo two cool utilities there.\n\n734\n00:39:26.373 --> 00:39:27.813\n>> Yep.\n\n735\n00:39:27.813 --> 00:39:30.900\n>> All right, let's say I look at this.\n\n736\n00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:32.430\nAnd, you know?\n\n737\n00:39:32.430 --> 00:39:36.270\nI see things are looking okay,\nbut my system is just slow.\n\n738\n00:39:36.270 --> 00:39:40.200\nWell, I might want to know what processes\nare running on my system, right?\n\n739\n00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:41.500\nWhat is running?\n\n740\n00:39:41.500 --> 00:39:42.852\nWhat's eating up all my CPU, all right?\n\n741\n00:39:42.852 --> 00:39:44.582\nThere's a couple of cool utilities.\n\n742\n00:39:44.582 --> 00:39:47.130\nI'm going to show you the standard\ndefault one first, and\n\n743\n00:39:47.130 --> 00:39:48.902\nthen I'll show you the cool one second.\n\n744\n00:39:48.902 --> 00:39:54.810\nBut the old school utility for looking\nat processes on your system is PS, okay.\n\n745\n00:39:54.810 --> 00:40:00.170\nNow PS, when you run that, will show\nthe processes running on your system but\n\n746\n00:40:00.170 --> 00:40:02.410\nit's actually very, very specific.\n\n747\n00:40:02.410 --> 00:40:05.380\nIt's showing processes that you ran and\n\n748\n00:40:05.380 --> 00:40:09.130\nthat you ran in the current\nsession that you're in.\n\n749\n00:40:09.130 --> 00:40:09.740\nAll right.\n\n750\n00:40:09.740 --> 00:40:11.750\nPS is a POSIX compliant command.\n\n751\n00:40:11.750 --> 00:40:16.029\nAnd in the POSIX requirements,\nthey require PS by it's self to do this,\n\n752\n00:40:16.029 --> 00:40:16.740\nall right.\n\n753\n00:40:16.740 --> 00:40:19.430\nSo, PS by itself is really just\nshowing what you're doing.\n\n754\n00:40:19.430 --> 00:40:21.830\nIf the system is slow though,\nit might not be your fault.\n\n755\n00:40:21.830 --> 00:40:23.980\nIt might be somebody else's fault.\n\n756\n00:40:23.980 --> 00:40:28.684\nAnd so as an administrator,\nwhich I'm not logged in as a user, but\n\n757\n00:40:28.684 --> 00:40:33.808\nas an administrator, you can run ps aux,\nA-U-X, and when you run that\n\n758\n00:40:33.808 --> 00:40:39.330\nit's gonna show you everybody's\nprocesses across the entire system.\n\n759\n00:40:39.330 --> 00:40:44.230\nAnd so when we run that,\nwe get a lot more output,\n\n760\n00:40:44.230 --> 00:40:47.210\nall the processes that\nare running on the system.\n\n761\n00:40:47.210 --> 00:40:47.940\nOkay.\n\n762\n00:40:47.940 --> 00:40:51.300\nNow, I do wanna mention one thing,\ncuz it can be confusing on the test.\n\n763\n00:40:51.300 --> 00:40:56.136\nNotice when I ran ps aux,\nI didn't do like a dash or anything.\n\n764\n00:40:56.136 --> 00:41:00.810\nOkay, if you do a dash,\nthe POSIX requirement for\n\n765\n00:41:00.810 --> 00:41:06.040\nthe PS commands are really strict and\nthe A, basically says\n\n766\n00:41:06.040 --> 00:41:11.460\nrun, or show all the processes, not\njust the ones tied to this user account.\n\n767\n00:41:11.460 --> 00:41:16.070\nAnd then U, actually specifies\nwhat user you're querying for.\n\n768\n00:41:16.070 --> 00:41:18.750\nAnd then X, would be the username.\n\n769\n00:41:18.750 --> 00:41:22.390\nSo if you do the dash, you're actually\nsaying show me all the processes for\n\n770\n00:41:22.390 --> 00:41:25.980\nuser named X,\nwhich is not gonna return much, right?\n\n771\n00:41:25.980 --> 00:41:32.130\nSo, this is one of those weird ones\nwhere they wanna stay POSIX compliant,\n\n772\n00:41:32.130 --> 00:41:34.830\nbut they want the command to do something\ndifferent, so there's hyphen on it.\n\n773\n00:41:34.830 --> 00:41:38.240\nSo it's a weird one, when you memorize\nthis, make sure you memorize it without\n\n774\n00:41:38.240 --> 00:41:42.880\nthe dash, ps aux, and\nthat's gonna show you all users\n\n775\n00:41:42.880 --> 00:41:47.270\nprocesses across the entire system\nregardless of how they're logged in.\n\n776\n00:41:47.270 --> 00:41:50.250\nAnd it gives you a lot of output,\nmore than fits on this screen, so\n\n777\n00:41:50.250 --> 00:41:52.110\nlet me clear that.\n\n778\n00:41:52.110 --> 00:41:54.720\nAnd I'm gonna rerun it and\njust pipe it into the less command.\n\n779\n00:41:56.610 --> 00:41:57.580\nAll right.\n\n780\n00:41:57.580 --> 00:42:01.460\nAcross the top, we get column titles that\ntell us what each one of these means.\n\n781\n00:42:01.460 --> 00:42:03.580\nThe first one is user, that's pretty easy.\n\n782\n00:42:03.580 --> 00:42:05.610\nYou can see who it is that ran something.\n\n783\n00:42:05.610 --> 00:42:07.040\nMost of the root stuff,\n\n784\n00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:10.040\nthat's gonna be caused by just\nthe system booting up and running.\n\n785\n00:42:10.040 --> 00:42:12.439\nDoesn't necessarily mean you're\nlogged in as root and doing things.\n\n786\n00:42:13.640 --> 00:42:15.770\nIt just means that this is\npart of the system booting up.\n\n787\n00:42:15.770 --> 00:42:19.043\nSo you'll see processes like SCSI and\nso on, which are just\n\n788\n00:42:19.043 --> 00:42:23.441\nmounting the hard drive, KDM is managing\nyour keyboard, and stuff like that.\n\n789\n00:42:23.441 --> 00:42:26.923\nActually no, KDM is,\nactually I think it is the keyboard.\n\n790\n00:42:26.923 --> 00:42:31.010\nAnyhow, EXT4 handling your file system and\nso on, so we'll see those.\n\n791\n00:42:31.010 --> 00:42:34.360\nBut as I scroll down eventually,\nI'll find something that I'm running.\n\n792\n00:42:34.360 --> 00:42:37.504\nYou know, old dpezet,\nit has gotta be in here somewhere.\n\n793\n00:42:37.504 --> 00:42:39.398\nI've at least got a shell opened.\n\n794\n00:42:39.398 --> 00:42:40.570\nThere I am, at the bottom.\n\n795\n00:42:40.570 --> 00:42:44.690\nSo I can see dpezet, I'm logged in,\nthere's my little processes.\n\n796\n00:42:44.690 --> 00:42:49.310\nAnd I guess you can't exactly see,\nyou can see part of it I guess but\n\n797\n00:42:49.310 --> 00:42:52.600\nthere's me running ps aux and\nthere's me running less.\n\n798\n00:42:52.600 --> 00:42:56.260\nSo remember I piped the output\nof ps aux in to less.\n\n799\n00:42:56.260 --> 00:42:58.160\nThat's two separate processes, and so\n\n800\n00:42:58.160 --> 00:43:01.000\nthere they are,\none after the other, all right?\n\n801\n00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:03.360\nMy shell will be in here,\nthere's my bash shell.\n\n802\n00:43:03.360 --> 00:43:04.770\nMy login is here.\n\n803\n00:43:04.770 --> 00:43:08.220\nNow, my login is actually tied to root,\nand that's kind of a funny thing.\n\n804\n00:43:08.220 --> 00:43:09.920\nLet me move this up on the screen.\n\n805\n00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:10.620\nThere.\n\n806\n00:43:10.620 --> 00:43:17.100\nSo you can see like right here,\nthe root process kicked off a login.\n\n807\n00:43:17.100 --> 00:43:19.530\nAnd the login was for dpezet.\n\n808\n00:43:19.530 --> 00:43:21.820\nWhen the system booted up,\nit had to give me a login prompt.\n\n809\n00:43:21.820 --> 00:43:23.520\nWell, who made that login prompt?\n\n810\n00:43:23.520 --> 00:43:25.750\nThe system did, so it shows as root.\n\n811\n00:43:25.750 --> 00:43:27.410\nI punched in my username and password.\n\n812\n00:43:27.410 --> 00:43:30.810\nAnd once I did that, it gave me a shell.\n\n813\n00:43:30.810 --> 00:43:37.892\nAnd so, the login was generated by root,\nbut the shell bash, that was run by me.\n\n814\n00:43:37.892 --> 00:43:39.027\nThat means the shell,\n\n815\n00:43:39.027 --> 00:43:43.155\nevery command I run in the shell is being\nrun under my process with my permissions.\n\n816\n00:43:45.336 --> 00:43:48.760\nAll right, let's take a look at\nsome of the other things in here.\n\n817\n00:43:48.760 --> 00:43:51.690\nNext is the PID or process ID.\n\n818\n00:43:51.690 --> 00:43:55.820\nThe process ID, every time an application\nexecutes, it gets an ID number.\n\n819\n00:43:55.820 --> 00:43:58.740\nAnd it's just used for\nkeeping them separate cuz if you run five\n\n820\n00:43:58.740 --> 00:44:02.760\ncopies of the same command, it has to keep\nthose separate and know which is which.\n\n821\n00:44:02.760 --> 00:44:06.340\nAnd if we ever wanna kill one of those\ncommands, if we need to like, stop it or\n\n822\n00:44:06.340 --> 00:44:10.090\ncancel it,\nwe need to know the ID number for it.\n\n823\n00:44:10.090 --> 00:44:13.400\nPercent CPU,\nhow much processor power is it using,\n\n824\n00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:14.625\nhow much CPU power is it needing?\n\n825\n00:44:14.625 --> 00:44:17.588\nPercent MEM, how much memory, right?\n\n826\n00:44:17.588 --> 00:44:20.188\nSome of the other ones are not quite so\nimportant.\n\n827\n00:44:20.188 --> 00:44:24.835\nVSZ, RSS, a lot of these are having\nto deal with the response time and\n\n828\n00:44:24.835 --> 00:44:26.050\nother activity.\n\n829\n00:44:26.050 --> 00:44:30.150\nTTY would be if somebody is running\nthis from an interactive shell.\n\n830\n00:44:30.150 --> 00:44:31.750\nIf they're sitting in front of the system.\n\n831\n00:44:33.110 --> 00:44:35.260\nSTAT are various status flags.\n\n832\n00:44:35.260 --> 00:44:37.920\nAgain, not too terribly important for\nus here.\n\n833\n00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:39.624\nStart is when it was executed.\n\n834\n00:44:39.624 --> 00:44:41.870\nSo, I must have booted\nthis machine at 9:10, so\n\n835\n00:44:41.870 --> 00:44:43.920\nthat's why most of this stuff shows 9:10.\n\n836\n00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:47.216\nBut if I scroll to the bottom,\nI'll see where I logged in as myself.\n\n837\n00:44:47.216 --> 00:44:49.678\nI didn't actually log in until 9:35.\n\n838\n00:44:49.678 --> 00:44:52.200\nSo, you can start to see\nsome of that down there.\n\n839\n00:44:52.200 --> 00:44:56.520\nAnd then you'll see the amount of\ntime that it's been running, so\n\n840\n00:44:56.520 --> 00:44:58.080\nunder that last time option.\n\n841\n00:44:58.080 --> 00:45:00.220\nAnd then the final column is command.\n\n842\n00:45:00.220 --> 00:45:01.110\nShows you what was run.\n\n843\n00:45:01.110 --> 00:45:02.880\nYou know what actually initiated this.\n\n844\n00:45:04.250 --> 00:45:05.980\nSo it's good information in there.\n\n845\n00:45:05.980 --> 00:45:10.460\nBy default it's sorted by process ID so\nthe order in which it was run.\n\n846\n00:45:10.460 --> 00:45:11.608\nYou might not want that.\n\n847\n00:45:11.608 --> 00:45:16.790\nYou might wanna sort it by CPU or\nby memory, or whatever, right?\n\n848\n00:45:16.790 --> 00:45:19.000\nYou might wanna sort it\nin a different order.\n\n849\n00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:23.794\nAnd if you wanna do that,\nthere are modifiers for the PS command.\n\n850\n00:45:23.794 --> 00:45:28.146\nIf you pull up the main page for the PS,\nyou'll see in here there's all sorts\n\n851\n00:45:28.146 --> 00:45:32.571\nof modifiers you can use to change that\noutput, and it's in here somewhere.\n\n852\n00:45:32.571 --> 00:45:33.071\nLet's see.\n\n853\n00:45:37.230 --> 00:45:39.100\nHere's your list, PID list.\n\n854\n00:45:39.100 --> 00:45:41.800\nI don't normally do it this way,\nso I don't know them off hand but\n\n855\n00:45:41.800 --> 00:45:47.029\nsomewhere in here we can specify,\nwell there's O which does the format.\n\n856\n00:45:47.029 --> 00:45:52.340\nAdds columns, well anyhow,\n\n857\n00:45:52.340 --> 00:45:55.260\nsomewhere in here is the, shoot,\nthere it was and I scrolled past it.\n\n858\n00:45:56.520 --> 00:45:57.700\nOrder, right there.\n\n859\n00:45:57.700 --> 00:46:00.820\nWe can set the sorting order, so\nby default, it is the PID, and\n\n860\n00:46:00.820 --> 00:46:04.580\nthen they give you the instructions\nin here, how to change it to maybe,\n\n861\n00:46:04.580 --> 00:46:07.370\nyou wanna monitor it by CPU usage or\nwhatever, so you can do that.\n\n862\n00:46:08.950 --> 00:46:10.680\nBut, I'll tell you what.\n\n863\n00:46:10.680 --> 00:46:13.360\nThere's two problems with PS.\n\n864\n00:46:13.360 --> 00:46:16.370\nProblem number one, is it was\nkinda difficult to sort it, right?\n\n865\n00:46:16.370 --> 00:46:19.478\nAnd problem number two,\nit shows you right now and\n\n866\n00:46:19.478 --> 00:46:22.370\nit's already obsolete\nby the time you see it.\n\n867\n00:46:22.370 --> 00:46:27.711\nThe output from the PS command, when I run\nps aux, that was from that very second.\n\n868\n00:46:27.711 --> 00:46:29.257\nAnd if I look at the screen\nfive minutes from now,\n\n869\n00:46:29.257 --> 00:46:30.400\nit's still from that very second.\n\n870\n00:46:30.400 --> 00:46:32.670\nSo it's not updating, right?\n\n871\n00:46:32.670 --> 00:46:37.250\nSo there's another utility we can use\nthat does update, and it's really cool.\n\n872\n00:46:37.250 --> 00:46:40.020\nThe utility is called top.\n\n873\n00:46:40.020 --> 00:46:47.090\nAnd top is like ps aux,\nexcept it runs and it constantly updates.\n\n874\n00:46:47.090 --> 00:46:49.360\nYou can sit there and watch it,\nand the information changes.\n\n875\n00:46:49.360 --> 00:46:51.650\nNow, I'm a regular user, so\nI probably can't run it.\n\n876\n00:46:51.650 --> 00:46:52.780\nIt let me run it.\n\n877\n00:46:52.780 --> 00:46:58.080\nSo here I am, I'm looking at top, and\nit's not gonna be terribly exciting for\n\n878\n00:46:58.080 --> 00:47:01.120\nme because there's not\nmuch going on this system.\n\n879\n00:47:01.120 --> 00:47:04.710\nBut you'll see it's running, it's up,\nand it's showing me those processes, and\n\n880\n00:47:04.710 --> 00:47:07.320\nactually the top process\njust jumped to the top.\n\n881\n00:47:07.320 --> 00:47:12.098\nBecause it's monitoring and seeing that\nCPU utilization and recalculating it.\n\n882\n00:47:12.098 --> 00:47:15.417\nIt's showing the percentage memory,\npercentage CPU,\n\n883\n00:47:15.417 --> 00:47:19.435\nthe amount of virtual memory that's\nbeing used, that vert column.\n\n884\n00:47:19.435 --> 00:47:24.000\nSo you can actually get an idea\nof what it is that's consuming\n\n885\n00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:26.430\nresources on your system.\n\n886\n00:47:26.430 --> 00:47:29.310\nIt, whoops, sorry,\nI hit a random key there.\n\n887\n00:47:29.310 --> 00:47:33.560\nBut, so it's monitoring that, and\nthat's really kind of a neat thing.\n\n888\n00:47:33.560 --> 00:47:37.080\nThe other thing is, you can press\na couple of keys on the keyboard.\n\n889\n00:47:37.080 --> 00:47:39.668\nIf you press M, it'll sort by memory.\n\n890\n00:47:39.668 --> 00:47:43.371\nIf you press C, it'll sort by CPU.\n\n891\n00:47:43.371 --> 00:47:47.633\nSo if you want the top CPU users\nat the top, you just press C.\n\n892\n00:47:47.633 --> 00:47:51.781\nAnd now you're seeing who's using\nthe top CPU or if you press M,\n\n893\n00:47:51.781 --> 00:47:56.370\nit will sort by memory and we'll get\nthat one right up there at the top also.\n\n894\n00:47:56.370 --> 00:47:58.371\nSo it's really easy to sort with this one.\n\n895\n00:47:58.371 --> 00:48:05.045\nTo kind of jump between them and\nshow that extra information and see it.\n\n896\n00:48:05.045 --> 00:48:06.607\nAnd if you keep tapping them,\n\n897\n00:48:06.607 --> 00:48:09.680\nit kind of changes that output\nto reflect different ways.\n\n898\n00:48:09.680 --> 00:48:13.201\nSo there's a lot of quick\ncustomizations that you can do.\n\n899\n00:48:13.201 --> 00:48:15.771\nAnd if you just hit H on your keyboard,\nyou'll get the help and\n\n900\n00:48:15.771 --> 00:48:18.158\nit'll show some of the different\nthings that you can do.\n\n901\n00:48:18.158 --> 00:48:22.020\nYou can change color mappings, I don't\nthink I even have coloring turned on.\n\n902\n00:48:22.020 --> 00:48:24.770\nBut you can do all sorts\nof neat stuff in here.\n\n903\n00:48:24.770 --> 00:48:28.940\nSo it's a lot easier to use and it's live.\n\n904\n00:48:28.940 --> 00:48:31.870\nAnd so when I want to see\nutilization on my system,\n\n905\n00:48:31.870 --> 00:48:34.120\nit's usually the top\ncommand that I go for.\n\n906\n00:48:34.120 --> 00:48:37.355\nIt shows other things across\nthe top of the top command.\n\n907\n00:48:37.355 --> 00:48:38.810\n[LAUGH] Very witty.\n\n908\n00:48:38.810 --> 00:48:40.630\nYou can see how much\nmemory you have total.\n\n909\n00:48:40.630 --> 00:48:41.530\nHow much is used.\n\n910\n00:48:41.530 --> 00:48:42.830\nHow much is free.\n\n911\n00:48:42.830 --> 00:48:47.210\nYou can see your amount of task running,\nyour up time.\n\n912\n00:48:47.210 --> 00:48:50.910\nYou can see all sorts of good data,\nright here, at the top of the screen.\n\n913\n00:48:50.910 --> 00:48:53.190\nAnd then beneath it,\nyou see that live data.\n\n914\n00:48:53.190 --> 00:48:55.510\n>> All right.\nI gotta ask about zombies.\n\n915\n00:48:55.510 --> 00:48:56.155\n>> Zombies?\n\n916\n00:48:56.155 --> 00:48:58.110\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Zombies are usually like\n\n917\n00:48:58.110 --> 00:48:59.360\ndisconnected commands.\n\n918\n00:48:59.360 --> 00:49:02.650\nSo you know a session is no longer active\nand it's still running in the background.\n\n919\n00:49:02.650 --> 00:49:04.030\nAbandoned tasks.\n\n920\n00:49:04.030 --> 00:49:05.094\n>> Well, we don't have any,\nso that's good.\n\n921\n00:49:05.094 --> 00:49:06.673\n>> We don't.\nThat's always a good thing.\n\n922\n00:49:06.673 --> 00:49:07.282\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Or\n\n923\n00:49:07.282 --> 00:49:11.470\nif you somehow have a task that\ndoesn't have a user attached to it.\n\n924\n00:49:11.470 --> 00:49:14.520\n>> Where you see that is usually\na user launched some activity, and\n\n925\n00:49:14.520 --> 00:49:17.840\nthen you've deleted the user account, and\nso now you've ended up with a zombie.\n\n926\n00:49:18.880 --> 00:49:22.130\n>> So those are basically what\nyou're going to see in there, and\n\n927\n00:49:22.130 --> 00:49:23.290\nit's good information.\n\n928\n00:49:23.290 --> 00:49:28.970\nIt's neat, it's pretty cool,\nand, can you not sort by VIRT?\n\n929\n00:49:30.090 --> 00:49:31.660\nShoot.\nHow do you sort by the VIRT command?\n\n930\n00:49:33.360 --> 00:49:36.077\nNo, the VIRT column.\n\n931\n00:49:36.077 --> 00:49:36.734\nIt doesn't show it here.\n\n932\n00:49:40.061 --> 00:49:43.240\nWell, so there's some neat stuff in\nthere that you can mess around with.\n\n933\n00:49:43.240 --> 00:49:48.490\nThere's some shortcuts which\nI'm not remembering off-hand.\n\n934\n00:49:48.490 --> 00:49:50.470\nYeah, well, anyhow.\n\n935\n00:49:50.470 --> 00:49:53.140\nSo there are some shortcuts you can\nuse to sort by different things.\n\n936\n00:49:53.140 --> 00:49:55.380\nI know you can sort by that VIRT\ncolumn because I've done it before.\n\n937\n00:49:55.380 --> 00:49:57.730\nI just can't remember\nthe keyword sequence for it.\n\n938\n00:49:57.730 --> 00:49:59.290\nBut yeah, that's the top command.\n\n939\n00:49:59.290 --> 00:50:00.118\nReally, really handy.\n\n940\n00:50:00.118 --> 00:50:03.318\nAll right.\n\n941\n00:50:03.318 --> 00:50:08.740\nThat kind of leads us to my next\nstatement, or our next topic.\n\n942\n00:50:08.740 --> 00:50:13.870\nWhich is a lot of processes that run\nare running in the background, and\n\n943\n00:50:13.870 --> 00:50:15.020\na command like top will show us, or\n\n944\n00:50:15.020 --> 00:50:19.450\nps aux, or whatever will show us\nwhat's running in the background.\n\n945\n00:50:19.450 --> 00:50:21.073\nBut, how does that happen?\n\n946\n00:50:21.073 --> 00:50:23.012\nHow do we get an application\nto run in the background?\n\n947\n00:50:23.012 --> 00:50:26.311\nHow do we get an application to stop,\nif it's already running in the background?\n\n948\n00:50:26.311 --> 00:50:28.099\nHow do we work with that stuff?\n\n949\n00:50:28.099 --> 00:50:30.928\nOkay, well that's what we're\ngoing to look at next,\n\n950\n00:50:30.928 --> 00:50:33.130\nwhich is multitasking under Linux.\n\n951\n00:50:33.130 --> 00:50:37.850\nWhen you're in a command line interface,\nmultitasking is a lot different, okay.\n\n952\n00:50:37.850 --> 00:50:41.060\nSo let's run through some\nexamples of how that works.\n\n953\n00:50:41.060 --> 00:50:45.270\nWhen we run a program, almost everything\nthat we've run in this show has been\n\n954\n00:50:45.270 --> 00:50:48.140\nsomething that runs and\nthen terminates, right?\n\n955\n00:50:48.140 --> 00:50:52.800\nSo when I run, ls-la, I get a list and\nthen the command's done.\n\n956\n00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:54.953\nThat's it.\nRight, it's over, it's out and that's it.\n\n957\n00:50:54.953 --> 00:50:56.330\nRight?\n\n958\n00:50:56.330 --> 00:50:58.560\nBut there are times when we\nwant to run something and\n\n959\n00:50:58.560 --> 00:51:00.590\nhave it run in the background.\n\n960\n00:51:00.590 --> 00:51:04.840\nWhere you want it to keep running,\nbut you keep working on the system.\n\n961\n00:51:04.840 --> 00:51:11.160\nAn example might be, lets say,\nI'm experimenting with a database.\n\n962\n00:51:11.160 --> 00:51:16.090\nI want to bring up a sequel data,\nMySQL database, and store some data in it,\n\n963\n00:51:16.090 --> 00:51:17.300\ndo some testing.\n\n964\n00:51:17.300 --> 00:51:20.180\nBut I don't want to install it on\nthe server and have it run as a service.\n\n965\n00:51:20.180 --> 00:51:21.020\nI don't want it always running.\n\n966\n00:51:21.020 --> 00:51:24.140\nI just want it running\nwhile I test with it, okay.\n\n967\n00:51:24.140 --> 00:51:27.436\nSo, I might install MySQL in here,\nwhich I've already done.\n\n968\n00:51:27.436 --> 00:51:32.105\nAnd then I might want to run it and\nthen work with it, okay?\n\n969\n00:51:32.105 --> 00:51:38.750\nWell, if I run it,\nwe can do mysqld, the daemon for\n\n970\n00:51:38.750 --> 00:51:42.205\nMySQL, which I don't think I've\nmentioned that in the show yet, have I?\n\n971\n00:51:42.205 --> 00:51:46.115\nIs that services, things that run in\nthe background when the system boots up,\n\n972\n00:51:46.115 --> 00:51:49.710\nthey're called daemons, and\nit's spelled D-A-E-M-O-N-S.\n\n973\n00:51:49.710 --> 00:51:52.741\nI used to say daymons for\nthe longest time, and\n\n974\n00:51:52.741 --> 00:51:57.115\nthen I watched some videos and\nheard Linus Torvald say, daemons.\n\n975\n00:51:57.115 --> 00:52:00.028\nSo anyhow, the daemons, and\nthey run in the background and\n\n976\n00:52:00.028 --> 00:52:03.730\nthey just sit there, and they wait for\nyou to interact with them.\n\n977\n00:52:03.730 --> 00:52:07.680\nSo MySQL, the database server,\nit's got a MySQL daemon,\n\n978\n00:52:07.680 --> 00:52:10.449\nit's designed to run in the background.\n\n979\n00:52:10.449 --> 00:52:13.008\nBut if I just run this command,\nI'm gonna bring it up in safe mode,\n\n980\n00:52:13.008 --> 00:52:14.820\nwhich means just run it for me.\n\n981\n00:52:14.820 --> 00:52:19.080\nWhen I run that, it fires up,\nI don't have permission.\n\n982\n00:52:19.080 --> 00:52:21.280\nLet me switch over to a root user.\n\n983\n00:52:21.280 --> 00:52:24.820\nAll right, we'll try that again.\n\n984\n00:52:24.820 --> 00:52:28.990\nWhen I run that, it runs and\nnow I'm running MySQL.\n\n985\n00:52:28.990 --> 00:52:32.678\nIt says it's starting up a session,\nand now it's running.\n\n986\n00:52:32.678 --> 00:52:34.900\nBut notice it didn't put\nme back to my prompt.\n\n987\n00:52:35.940 --> 00:52:40.920\nI'm running MySQL and\nI'm now trapped inside of it.\n\n988\n00:52:40.920 --> 00:52:41.800\nIt's a server.\n\n989\n00:52:41.800 --> 00:52:43.010\nIt's a service running in the background.\n\n990\n00:52:43.010 --> 00:52:47.770\nIt's waiting for me to send SQL commands\nto it through the standard SQL ports.\n\n991\n00:52:47.770 --> 00:52:51.790\nIt's not expecting keyboard input,\nand so it's just gonna sit here, and\n\n992\n00:52:51.790 --> 00:52:52.530\nnow I'm stuck.\n\n993\n00:52:52.530 --> 00:52:53.820\n>> Yeah.\n>> I'm dead in the water.\n\n994\n00:52:54.830 --> 00:52:57.300\nSo, what can I do about that?\n\n995\n00:52:57.300 --> 00:52:59.880\nWell, there's actually a couple of neat\nthings that we can do when it comes to\n\n996\n00:52:59.880 --> 00:53:01.130\nmultitasking.\n\n997\n00:53:01.130 --> 00:53:03.944\nIf you are physically in\nfront of the machine,\n\n998\n00:53:03.944 --> 00:53:06.481\nthere's a neat little trick you can use.\n\n999\n00:53:06.481 --> 00:53:08.975\nWhat we're looking at,\nthis console that we're looking at,\n\n1000\n00:53:08.975 --> 00:53:10.159\nthis is what's called a TTY.\n\n1001\n00:53:10.159 --> 00:53:13.665\nAll right, which that stands for\na teletype interface, for the,\n\n1002\n00:53:13.665 --> 00:53:16.928\nwell I don't wanna call it old system,\nwe still use it today.\n\n1003\n00:53:16.928 --> 00:53:21.559\nFor people like, if you're deaf and\nyou want to make a phone call, well,\n\n1004\n00:53:21.559 --> 00:53:25.611\nyou can't really make a phone call,\nif you're unable to hear.\n\n1005\n00:53:25.611 --> 00:53:28.963\nAnd so they have the teletype system,\nwhere they're able to type, and it sends\n\n1006\n00:53:28.963 --> 00:53:32.620\nthat over the phone line to the other\nside, where it's displayed on a screen.\n\n1007\n00:53:32.620 --> 00:53:36.583\nThat same teletype technology is what\npower's our console on a Linux or\n\n1008\n00:53:36.583 --> 00:53:38.070\nUnix-based machine.\n\n1009\n00:53:38.070 --> 00:53:40.200\nSo they call them TTYs.\n\n1010\n00:53:40.200 --> 00:53:42.270\nAnd when you install Linux,\nand you boot up, and\n\n1011\n00:53:42.270 --> 00:53:45.710\nyou log in to the first time,\nyou're on TTY number one.\n\n1012\n00:53:45.710 --> 00:53:50.220\nWell, most distributions out\nthere create more than one TTY.\n\n1013\n00:53:50.220 --> 00:53:52.530\nI'm on CentOS it does 6 by default.\n\n1014\n00:53:52.530 --> 00:53:53.600\nAll right, and so\n\n1015\n00:53:53.600 --> 00:53:59.670\nwhat I can do is I can say well this\nTTY is stuck running my SQL now right.\n\n1016\n00:53:59.670 --> 00:54:02.700\nBut I've got five more TTYs I can jump to.\n\n1017\n00:54:02.700 --> 00:54:09.700\nAnd all you do is on your keyboard\nyou use ALT+ F1 through ALT + F6.\n\n1018\n00:54:09.700 --> 00:54:14.349\nWhen you hit those, so\nI'm on TTY1 which would be ALT + F1.\n\n1019\n00:54:14.349 --> 00:54:21.860\nAnd if I do ALT + F2, I jump to an all\nnew TTY and I can get logged in here.\n\n1020\n00:54:21.860 --> 00:54:23.290\nAnd I'm gonna break the rules and\nlog in as root.\n\n1021\n00:54:23.290 --> 00:54:26.769\nAnd I'll type my password wrong.\n\n1022\n00:54:29.149 --> 00:54:31.880\nSo I can log in over here and\nI can run PS.\n\n1023\n00:54:31.880 --> 00:54:36.600\nAnd see how when I run PS, I'm only seeing\nthings from my TTY and my user, right.\n\n1024\n00:54:36.600 --> 00:54:38.890\nSo I'm just seeing what\nroot is running here.\n\n1025\n00:54:38.890 --> 00:54:42.390\nBut if I do ps aux, and that will be so\n\n1026\n00:54:42.390 --> 00:54:46.550\nmuch nicer later when we learn about grep,\nwe haven't learned about it yet.\n\n1027\n00:54:46.550 --> 00:54:50.390\nBut I can see right here on\nthe screen MySQL is running.\n\n1028\n00:54:50.390 --> 00:54:55.150\nAnd it's running, you know, for well for\nitself really, but that's what's running\n\n1029\n00:54:55.150 --> 00:54:59.220\nin my other TTY, so I can see it right\nhere TTY1, MySQL is running right.\n\n1030\n00:55:00.340 --> 00:55:04.814\nAnd so now I could do something here,\nand then I could hit ALT+F3 and\n\n1031\n00:55:04.814 --> 00:55:06.572\nthere's another one.\n\n1032\n00:55:06.572 --> 00:55:11.180\nAnd ALT+F4, 5, 6,\neach one of those is a different TTY.\n\n1033\n00:55:11.180 --> 00:55:13.975\nI can login as different users.\n\n1034\n00:55:13.975 --> 00:55:15.210\nSo here I am on TTY6.\n\n1035\n00:55:15.210 --> 00:55:19.003\nNow, be careful with that\nmessage that pops up,\n\n1036\n00:55:19.003 --> 00:55:23.175\nit is saying last login was\ndone at this time onTTY1.\n\n1037\n00:55:23.175 --> 00:55:25.668\nOkay?\nSo I logged in on TTY1 before,\n\n1038\n00:55:25.668 --> 00:55:28.132\nthat doesn't mean I'm on TTY1 now.\n\n1039\n00:55:28.132 --> 00:55:33.298\nI'm actually on TTY6, if I do ps,\nI'll see it right there.\n\n1040\n00:55:33.298 --> 00:55:38.058\nFrom there I can jump back, ALT+F4,\nALT+F2, here's that other root instance,\n\n1041\n00:55:38.058 --> 00:55:40.610\nALT+F1, there's where MySQL is running.\n\n1042\n00:55:40.610 --> 00:55:45.818\nThis is basic multi tasking,\nif you're sitting at your machine.\n\n1043\n00:55:45.818 --> 00:55:49.421\nIf you're sitting at the machine, you can\ndo this ALT+F1, ALT+F6 or whatever, and\n\n1044\n00:55:49.421 --> 00:55:50.680\njump between these sessions.\n\n1045\n00:55:50.680 --> 00:55:55.138\nAnd you can run six interactive programs,\nall at the same time, right.\n\n1046\n00:55:55.138 --> 00:55:58.180\nSo quick and easy,\nif you're at the machine.\n\n1047\n00:55:58.180 --> 00:55:59.310\nBut what if we're not at the machine?\n\n1048\n00:55:59.310 --> 00:56:00.053\n>> Hm.\n\n1049\n00:56:00.053 --> 00:56:01.780\n>> What if we're not at that keyboard?\n\n1050\n00:56:01.780 --> 00:56:05.440\nWell when you SSH in to a server,\nyou can't do alt F1,\n\n1051\n00:56:05.440 --> 00:56:09.040\nalt F2,\nbecause your SSH session is your session.\n\n1052\n00:56:09.040 --> 00:56:11.360\nSo you could open up more\nthan one SSH connection.\n\n1053\n00:56:11.360 --> 00:56:12.100\nYou could do that.\n\n1054\n00:56:12.100 --> 00:56:14.160\nYou could have six windows,\nor however many you want.\n\n1055\n00:56:14.160 --> 00:56:16.120\nYou can have a lot more than six.\n\n1056\n00:56:16.120 --> 00:56:20.140\nOr you can make use of some of the command\nline utilities that we're about to\n\n1057\n00:56:20.140 --> 00:56:21.400\nsee, alright.\n\n1058\n00:56:21.400 --> 00:56:23.540\nBut looking at the clock it's\na good spot for our break.\n\n1059\n00:56:23.540 --> 00:56:24.277\nSo why don't we do this.\n\n1060\n00:56:24.277 --> 00:56:28.815\nWe're going to stop and take a break and\nwhen we get back we're gonna look at some\n\n1061\n00:56:28.815 --> 00:56:33.109\nmore multi tasking commands that we can\nuse to get a lot going on our system.\n\n1062\n00:56:33.109 --> 00:56:33.984\n>> Sound great.\n\n1063\n00:56:33.984 --> 00:56:41.609\n[MUSIC]\n\n1064\n00:56:41.609 --> 00:56:43.140\n>> All right, welcome back everybody.\n\n1065\n00:56:43.140 --> 00:56:48.430\n[LAUGH] During the break I ran a command\nand I didn't think about it running but\n\n1066\n00:56:48.430 --> 00:56:50.510\nit should be a good idea\nto mention on the show.\n\n1067\n00:56:50.510 --> 00:56:55.255\nWhen you're dealing multiple TTYs like we\nare, it's [LAUGH] it's not uncommon for\n\n1068\n00:56:55.255 --> 00:56:57.380\nme to forget who I'm logged in as right.\n\n1069\n00:56:57.380 --> 00:57:05.625\nSo before the break I had logged in like\non TTY 6 as dpezet and different logins.\n\n1070\n00:57:05.625 --> 00:57:10.685\nAnd normally your prompt will tell you\nwho you are, so I could see root@local.\n\n1071\n00:57:10.685 --> 00:57:14.910\nSo I know I'm root here, and\nif I run over here I see dpezet@localhost.\n\n1072\n00:57:14.910 --> 00:57:19.570\nSo I know who I'm logged in as, but if you\never forget and you're on a system whose\n\n1073\n00:57:19.570 --> 00:57:23.890\nprompt doesn't show the user name,\nthere's a command called whoamI.\n\n1074\n00:57:23.890 --> 00:57:27.020\nIf you ever just can't remember who\nyou're logged in as, you don't know,\n\n1075\n00:57:27.020 --> 00:57:31.400\nyou can run whoamI and\nit will return your user name.\n\n1076\n00:57:31.400 --> 00:57:32.860\nGreat way to see that.\n\n1077\n00:57:32.860 --> 00:57:35.170\nNow you might ask yourself,\nwhy would you forget?\n\n1078\n00:57:35.170 --> 00:57:36.100\nWell.\n\n1079\n00:57:36.100 --> 00:57:39.730\nAs an administrator, oftentimes we may\nneed to get elevated privileges for\n\n1080\n00:57:39.730 --> 00:57:44.530\na brief time and so we might use\ncommands like SU and when we do that,\n\n1081\n00:57:44.530 --> 00:57:46.280\nit actually changes who we are.\n\n1082\n00:57:46.280 --> 00:57:48.410\nSee how the prompt just changed the root.\n\n1083\n00:57:48.410 --> 00:57:52.460\nAnd so you might not remember if you\nare already elevated or not and so\n\n1084\n00:57:52.460 --> 00:57:54.460\nit's a great way to see that.\n\n1085\n00:57:54.460 --> 00:57:58.460\nTo verify what user account you're\nactually executing the commands under.\n\n1086\n00:57:58.460 --> 00:58:03.009\nSo I didn't think about it,\nI just ran it because I forgot who I was.\n\n1087\n00:58:03.009 --> 00:58:06.690\nSo [LAUGH] alright, so\nlets talk about multitasking.\n\n1088\n00:58:06.690 --> 00:58:13.760\nNow back over here,\nI ran MySQL, and I ran it\n\n1089\n00:58:13.760 --> 00:58:17.830\nin my interactive user prompt and now I'm\nstuck, now I'm just stuck right in here.\n\n1090\n00:58:17.830 --> 00:58:23.230\nAnd if I start typing ls -la,\nit doesn't know what that means.\n\n1091\n00:58:23.230 --> 00:58:27.370\nAnd if we do quit, or exit,\nor whatever, I'm just stuck.\n\n1092\n00:58:28.460 --> 00:58:30.040\nSo what do I do?\n\n1093\n00:58:30.040 --> 00:58:32.540\nWell there's a few things you can do here.\n\n1094\n00:58:32.540 --> 00:58:34.843\nOption number one is you\ncould hit control C.\n\n1095\n00:58:34.843 --> 00:58:39.020\nControl c is like the universal braking\ncommand and it will normally exit you out.\n\n1096\n00:58:39.020 --> 00:58:41.500\nIt's supposed to be short for cancel.\n\n1097\n00:58:41.500 --> 00:58:43.510\nCancel you need to get out.\n\n1098\n00:58:43.510 --> 00:58:47.010\nProblem is, it doesn't necessarily do\nthings very smoothly or gracefully.\n\n1099\n00:58:47.010 --> 00:58:48.640\nBut it may work.\n\n1100\n00:58:48.640 --> 00:58:53.460\nAnother option though is maybe I just want\nthis program to run in the background, and\n\n1101\n00:58:53.460 --> 00:58:56.876\none way we can do that\nis by hitting control Z.\n\n1102\n00:58:56.876 --> 00:59:03.630\nControl Z will say they move that\nprogram to the background, all right.\n\n1103\n00:59:03.630 --> 00:59:04.965\nAnd so that's what it just did.\n\n1104\n00:59:04.965 --> 00:59:07.025\nMySQL just got moved to the background.\n\n1105\n00:59:07.025 --> 00:59:10.580\nNow notice the message that comes up.\n\n1106\n00:59:10.580 --> 00:59:13.000\nOne stopped MySQL, okay.\n\n1107\n00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:15.370\nThat doesn't mean that MySQLl\nisn't running anymore.\n\n1108\n00:59:15.370 --> 00:59:19.650\nIt just stopped having control\nover your command line interface,\n\n1109\n00:59:19.650 --> 00:59:21.730\nit's still running in the background.\n\n1110\n00:59:21.730 --> 00:59:23.580\nHow do I know that?\n\n1111\n00:59:23.580 --> 00:59:25.780\nWell there's a few ways I can verify that,\nright.\n\n1112\n00:59:25.780 --> 00:59:27.340\nThere's the ps command.\n\n1113\n00:59:27.340 --> 00:59:30.620\nThat'll show me that I'm still\nrunning MySQL in the background.\n\n1114\n00:59:30.620 --> 00:59:35.070\nBut there's also another\ncommand called jobs, and\n\n1115\n00:59:35.070 --> 00:59:37.560\nthe job command is gonna\nbe really important to us.\n\n1116\n00:59:37.560 --> 00:59:40.900\nWhen you run jobs it shows you\nthe programs that are running in\n\n1117\n00:59:40.900 --> 00:59:45.050\nthe background of your session and the\nnumber associated with that program, so\n\n1118\n00:59:45.050 --> 00:59:47.875\nthat you can jump back to it\nif you wanna get back to it.\n\n1119\n00:59:47.875 --> 00:59:49.360\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Right.\n\n1120\n00:59:49.360 --> 00:59:52.640\nHow do I reconnect to that program if I\nwanna get back to it to do something?\n\n1121\n00:59:52.640 --> 00:59:56.830\nWell I can run jobs and\nfind it's job number.\n\n1122\n00:59:56.830 --> 01:00:00.095\nAnd then I can just type percent and\nthe job number.\n\n1123\n01:00:00.095 --> 01:00:07.385\nSo MySQLd is running as job number one,\nso I could %1 and now I'm back in it.\n\n1124\n01:00:07.385 --> 01:00:11.650\nNow there's not much I can do\nfrom here but I'm back in it.\n\n1125\n01:00:11.650 --> 01:00:17.220\nLet me pick another program, a program\nthat I can actually do something in.\n\n1126\n01:00:17.220 --> 01:00:20.990\nSo I installed a Midnight Commander\non this system.\n\n1127\n01:00:20.990 --> 01:00:25.130\nAnd a Midnight Commander, it's a nice\nlittle file commander, or file utility for\n\n1128\n01:00:25.130 --> 01:00:26.660\ncopying and pasting and stuff.\n\n1129\n01:00:26.660 --> 01:00:28.210\nIf you've never seen it,\nlet me just run it.\n\n1130\n01:00:28.210 --> 01:00:29.390\nHere it we go.\n\n1131\n01:00:29.390 --> 01:00:31.690\nAnd it gives you a little\ngraphical representation, and\n\n1132\n01:00:31.690 --> 01:00:34.150\nyou can go through here and\nyou can pick files on the left and\n\n1133\n01:00:34.150 --> 01:00:38.150\ncopy them on the right and all that stuff,\nso it's a neat little utility, right.\n\n1134\n01:00:38.150 --> 01:00:41.580\nAnd so if I run it, here it is,\nit's running, it's in the background,\n\n1135\n01:00:41.580 --> 01:00:42.970\nI can hit Ctrl+Z.\n\n1136\n01:00:42.970 --> 01:00:44.390\nNow it's in the background.\n\n1137\n01:00:44.390 --> 01:00:46.540\nI'm sorry,\nit was in the foreground a second ago.\n\n1138\n01:00:46.540 --> 01:00:49.510\nAnd when I run jobs,\nI can see I have two jobs, right.\n\n1139\n01:00:49.510 --> 01:00:51.210\nJob number one, job number two.\n\n1140\n01:00:51.210 --> 01:00:54.800\nAnd job number two,\nthat's the one that I was in last and\n\n1141\n01:00:54.800 --> 01:00:58.320\nI can see that it's running\nmidnight commander, alright.\n\n1142\n01:00:58.320 --> 01:01:03.900\nIf I do %1, that takes me into MySQL,\nwhich is just sitting here and\n\n1143\n01:01:03.900 --> 01:01:08.630\nif I do %2,\nit takes me back to midnight commander.\n\n1144\n01:01:08.630 --> 01:01:10.810\nSo I can start running as\nmany things as I want.\n\n1145\n01:01:10.810 --> 01:01:13.940\nI can run them and hit Control Z and\nthey'll just sit there.\n\n1146\n01:01:13.940 --> 01:01:17.090\nAnd I can come back to\nthem when I'm ready.\n\n1147\n01:01:17.090 --> 01:01:20.180\nYou can run more than one\ninstance of a program, right.\n\n1148\n01:01:20.180 --> 01:01:26.930\nSo here I am on the left side working\nwith this file or whatever here.\n\n1149\n01:01:26.930 --> 01:01:29.470\nMaybe I'll go on the right side this time,\nright.\n\n1150\n01:01:29.470 --> 01:01:31.540\nAnd then I'll stick\nthat in the background.\n\n1151\n01:01:31.540 --> 01:01:34.460\nAnd I'll run another copy\nof midnight commander.\n\n1152\n01:01:34.460 --> 01:01:38.130\nAnd this one I'm on the left side I'm\ngonna highlight readme.txt all right.\n\n1153\n01:01:38.130 --> 01:01:40.140\nI can stick it in the background, and\n\n1154\n01:01:40.140 --> 01:01:44.910\nwhen I run jobs I can see I've got two\ninstances of midnight commander running,\n\n1155\n01:01:44.910 --> 01:01:49.070\nI can jump to either one if I want I can\njump to a number two or number three.\n\n1156\n01:01:49.070 --> 01:01:52.260\nNumber two is the one that I left\nwith the cursor on the right side of\n\n1157\n01:01:52.260 --> 01:01:52.970\nthe screen, right.\n\n1158\n01:01:52.970 --> 01:01:56.120\nSo if I jump back to that, there it is.\n\n1159\n01:01:56.120 --> 01:02:01.330\nAnd if I do %3, now I'm on the one with\nthe cursor on the left side of the screen.\n\n1160\n01:02:01.330 --> 01:02:03.700\nSo you can jump back and\nforth between these activities.\n\n1161\n01:02:03.700 --> 01:02:07.100\nThey're all running in the background,\nand they're being multitasked.\n\n1162\n01:02:07.100 --> 01:02:08.320\nThey're all running.\n\n1163\n01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:09.285\nSo pretty cool.\n\n1164\n01:02:09.285 --> 01:02:10.490\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1165\n01:02:10.490 --> 01:02:13.360\n>> There are a few other things\nwe could do to handle this,\n\n1166\n01:02:13.360 --> 01:02:15.090\nget these things running\nin the background.\n\n1167\n01:02:16.610 --> 01:02:18.830\nThere are some utilities like BG.\n\n1168\n01:02:18.830 --> 01:02:24.230\nThe BG utility if you take a look at it,\nit's kind of like the jobs command.\n\n1169\n01:02:24.230 --> 01:02:28.150\nIt's actually an alias, so\nit doesn't have a true man page.\n\n1170\n01:02:28.150 --> 01:02:32.200\nBut it's kinda like the jobs utility in\nthat if you run BG it'll show you some of\n\n1171\n01:02:32.200 --> 01:02:33.760\nthe things that are running\nin the background.\n\n1172\n01:02:33.760 --> 01:02:36.750\nIt really shows you the last thing\nthat you push in the background.\n\n1173\n01:02:36.750 --> 01:02:40.200\nSee I have a job number three, but\nnot number one and number two.\n\n1174\n01:02:40.200 --> 01:02:41.440\nAll right.\n\n1175\n01:02:41.440 --> 01:02:45.460\nWhat it's actually showing me\nis the last one that I was in.\n\n1176\n01:02:45.460 --> 01:02:50.150\nAnd if I ever run Fg,\nthat means take whatever I was in last and\n\n1177\n01:02:50.150 --> 01:02:51.920\nput it in the foreground.\n\n1178\n01:02:51.920 --> 01:02:55.970\nfg is foreground and if I run that you'll\nsee it takes me into the one that I was in\n\n1179\n01:02:55.970 --> 01:02:58.992\nlast, the Midnight Commander with\nthe cursor on the left side.\n\n1180\n01:02:58.992 --> 01:03:02.300\nSo BG will show me what that program is,\n\n1181\n01:03:02.300 --> 01:03:04.910\nFG will actually bring it\nback to the foreground.\n\n1182\n01:03:04.910 --> 01:03:08.160\nAnd I can just hit control Z to stick\nit right back in the background again,\n\n1183\n01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:09.190\nand there it goes.\n\n1184\n01:03:09.190 --> 01:03:12.340\nI don't usually use the BG command\nbecause you can just use jobs, and\n\n1185\n01:03:12.340 --> 01:03:16.430\nyou can see it right in there.\n\n1186\n01:03:16.430 --> 01:03:19.860\nSo that's some of the ways that\nwe can kind of manipulate that.\n\n1187\n01:03:19.860 --> 01:03:22.440\nNow what if we have\nsomething that's stuck?\n\n1188\n01:03:22.440 --> 01:03:26.660\nIt's just stuck ,and frozen,\nand that it's locked up?\n\n1189\n01:03:26.660 --> 01:03:29.120\nYou can hit control Z to stick\nit in the background, but\n\n1190\n01:03:29.120 --> 01:03:32.730\nyou need to get rid of that job somehow,\nget rid of that process.\n\n1191\n01:03:32.730 --> 01:03:37.530\nSo one of the things we can do is we can\nuse that job number to kill the process.\n\n1192\n01:03:37.530 --> 01:03:39.180\nAll right?\nYou can also use the PID.\n\n1193\n01:03:39.180 --> 01:03:43.360\nIf you know the process ID,\nyou can kill based on a process ID.\n\n1194\n01:03:43.360 --> 01:03:46.210\nBut if we know the job number,\nwe can kill that way too.\n\n1195\n01:03:46.210 --> 01:03:48.032\nSo [LAUGH] the many ways that we kill,\nright.\n\n1196\n01:03:48.032 --> 01:03:52.734\nSo I'm gonna kill %2, okay?\n\n1197\n01:03:52.734 --> 01:03:55.555\nI'm saying kill job number two.\n\n1198\n01:03:55.555 --> 01:03:59.492\nIt shows me the current status of job\nnumber two, job number two is stopped.\n\n1199\n01:03:59.492 --> 01:04:03.170\nAnd if I just press Enter a few times,\nI'll normally get an update.\n\n1200\n01:04:03.170 --> 01:04:05.590\nAnd there it is,\njob number two just got terminated.\n\n1201\n01:04:05.590 --> 01:04:09.450\nOkay, so I didn't do anything other than\njust tap enter to make the screen update.\n\n1202\n01:04:09.450 --> 01:04:12.760\nIt won't display unless\nthe screen updates.\n\n1203\n01:04:12.760 --> 01:04:15.850\nSo if I run jobs,\nI can see job number two is now gone.\n\n1204\n01:04:15.850 --> 01:04:16.970\nAll right?\n\n1205\n01:04:16.970 --> 01:04:18.614\nSo that's one way to go about it.\n\n1206\n01:04:18.614 --> 01:04:23.656\nIf we're using like PS,\nI can see that my other midnight\n\n1207\n01:04:23.656 --> 01:04:29.682\ncommander has process ID 6077,\nso I could say kill 6077.\n\n1208\n01:04:29.682 --> 01:04:32.280\nAnd it'll kill that process ID, okay.\n\n1209\n01:04:32.280 --> 01:04:35.060\nNow, if I take a look at my jobs,\nit's still there so\n\n1210\n01:04:35.060 --> 01:04:38.040\nit may take a little bit for\nit to actually die out.\n\n1211\n01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:39.873\nBut eventually it will die out.\n\n1212\n01:04:39.873 --> 01:04:42.218\nSo we can kill based on the process ID or\nthe job number.\n\n1213\n01:04:42.218 --> 01:04:44.435\nThe difference is that percent symbol.\n\n1214\n01:04:44.435 --> 01:04:47.345\nIf you're killing on a job number,\nit would be percent and\n\n1215\n01:04:47.345 --> 01:04:50.085\nthe job number on a PID,\nit would just be the straight up number.\n\n1216\n01:04:50.085 --> 01:04:52.625\nSo I think it's still holding in there.\n\n1217\n01:04:53.675 --> 01:04:56.655\nApplications with interactive user\ninterfaces are always the worst,\n\n1218\n01:04:56.655 --> 01:04:59.535\ncuz sometimes they'll sit there and\nthey'll say something like,\n\n1219\n01:04:59.535 --> 01:05:02.505\ndid you wanna save or whatever,\nand they'll just be stuck.\n\n1220\n01:05:02.505 --> 01:05:05.505\nThis one,\nI don't know why it hasn't died out yet.\n\n1221\n01:05:05.505 --> 01:05:06.795\nHere, I'll just kill it outright.\n\n1222\n01:05:08.240 --> 01:05:10.130\nThere we go.\nTerminate it.\n\n1223\n01:05:10.130 --> 01:05:12.240\nSo, manipulating these\ncommands in the background,\n\n1224\n01:05:12.240 --> 01:05:17.060\nobviously it's better if we can go and\nexit out of them gracefully instead of\n\n1225\n01:05:17.060 --> 01:05:20.630\nkilling the process, especially with\nsomething like a SQL database, right?\n\n1226\n01:05:20.630 --> 01:05:23.150\n>> Yeah.\n>> Cuz, if you just kill it, it might have\n\n1227\n01:05:23.150 --> 01:05:26.880\nbeen in the middle of writing data to\nthe database and you can get corruption.\n\n1228\n01:05:26.880 --> 01:05:29.410\nYou'll almost always get corruption\non your transaction logs.\n\n1229\n01:05:29.410 --> 01:05:31.050\nSo that's something we\ngotta watch out for.\n\n1230\n01:05:31.050 --> 01:05:35.980\nSo, but yeah, I still have that\nguy running in the background and,\n\n1231\n01:05:35.980 --> 01:05:40.680\nI don't actually remember the command to\nescape out of MySQL once it's running.\n\n1232\n01:05:40.680 --> 01:05:42.190\nThere is a keyboard shortcut you hit,\n\n1233\n01:05:42.190 --> 01:05:47.400\nit's like control W or,\nwell apparently I don't know what it is.\n\n1234\n01:05:47.400 --> 01:05:49.730\nAll right, but yeah, so\nthat one's gonna keep running.\n\n1235\n01:05:49.730 --> 01:05:51.560\nI can just kill it, I guess.\n\n1236\n01:05:51.560 --> 01:05:54.290\nSo, we'll kill that one off.\n\n1237\n01:05:56.460 --> 01:05:57.960\nThere it goes, and it's mad at me.\n\n1238\n01:05:57.960 --> 01:06:01.600\nSo, it's not gonna be happy\nwhen it dies out like that, but\n\n1239\n01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:05.560\nit shows that it was ended and\nnow it's off.\n\n1240\n01:06:05.560 --> 01:06:06.230\nAll right, let's see.\n\n1241\n01:06:06.230 --> 01:06:11.680\nThat was, see, kill, BG, FG,\nso we covered most of those.\n\n1242\n01:06:11.680 --> 01:06:13.542\nWhat else do we have?\n\n1243\n01:06:13.542 --> 01:06:15.590\nPriorities.\n\n1244\n01:06:15.590 --> 01:06:20.030\nAll right, when a job runs in\nthe background, the job is running,\n\n1245\n01:06:20.030 --> 01:06:24.410\nwe might have several different\nthings all running at once, right?\n\n1246\n01:06:24.410 --> 01:06:28.360\nWell, by default,\nthey're being evenly distributed.\n\n1247\n01:06:28.360 --> 01:06:31.420\nSo they each get even\naccess to the system.\n\n1248\n01:06:31.420 --> 01:06:36.620\nSo, if you run three copies of midnight\ncommander, all three have the same\n\n1249\n01:06:36.620 --> 01:06:40.350\npriority level when it comes to accessing\nthe processor and memory of your system.\n\n1250\n01:06:40.350 --> 01:06:41.530\nAll right?\n\n1251\n01:06:41.530 --> 01:06:46.260\nIn Linux, we have something called\na niceness value, all right?\n\n1252\n01:06:46.260 --> 01:06:50.512\nEach process by default is being nice and\nplaying fairly with everybody else.\n\n1253\n01:06:50.512 --> 01:06:57.580\nSo even multitasking across all\nthe different processes that are running.\n\n1254\n01:06:57.580 --> 01:07:02.167\nBut it's possible that you might have\na script or utility that you want to have\n\n1255\n01:07:02.167 --> 01:07:05.498\nhigher priority when accessing\nthe processor memory.\n\n1256\n01:07:05.498 --> 01:07:08.273\nYou want it to run with\na higher priority level, okay?\n\n1257\n01:07:08.273 --> 01:07:12.520\nAnd we do that by adjusting\nthe niceness value.\n\n1258\n01:07:12.520 --> 01:07:13.610\nIt's kind of a silly term.\n\n1259\n01:07:13.610 --> 01:07:16.460\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But niceness is what it is called.\n\n1260\n01:07:16.460 --> 01:07:21.019\nWhen we do the PS command,\nthat shows us our processes, right?\n\n1261\n01:07:21.019 --> 01:07:23.975\nLet me show you guys something kinda neat.\n\n1262\n01:07:23.975 --> 01:07:28.770\nI've been running commands like mc for\nmidnight commander.\n\n1263\n01:07:28.770 --> 01:07:32.080\nAnd then hitting control Z to\nmove it in the background, right?\n\n1264\n01:07:32.080 --> 01:07:35.530\nWhat if I wanna run something and\nI know I want it to go to the background.\n\n1265\n01:07:35.530 --> 01:07:36.170\nRight?\n\n1266\n01:07:36.170 --> 01:07:39.740\nYou can have something\nautomatically go to the background\n\n1267\n01:07:39.740 --> 01:07:42.830\nby adding the ampersand to the end of it.\n\n1268\n01:07:42.830 --> 01:07:46.310\nIf you stick an ampersand at the end\nof the command, that says run it and\n\n1269\n01:07:46.310 --> 01:07:47.470\nstick it in the background.\n\n1270\n01:07:47.470 --> 01:07:50.010\nAll right, it just saves you a little bit\nof time so you don't have to go in and\n\n1271\n01:07:50.010 --> 01:07:51.280\nhit control Z.\n\n1272\n01:07:51.280 --> 01:07:52.410\nSo I can fire that up.\n\n1273\n01:07:53.450 --> 01:07:54.920\nThere it goes firing up MySQL and\n\n1274\n01:07:54.920 --> 01:07:58.030\nif I tap enter,\nI'm back in my command prompt, right?\n\n1275\n01:07:58.030 --> 01:07:59.490\nIt's still running in the background.\n\n1276\n01:07:59.490 --> 01:08:01.706\nAnd so\nI can start running some other utilities.\n\n1277\n01:08:01.706 --> 01:08:04.238\nAnd, it's gonna die unless I,\nwell no, actually does it run?\n\n1278\n01:08:04.238 --> 01:08:06.690\nYeah, it ran, okay.\n\n1279\n01:08:06.690 --> 01:08:07.990\nSo, we can see them back there.\n\n1280\n01:08:07.990 --> 01:08:10.010\nSee MySQL is up and running and happy.\n\n1281\n01:08:10.010 --> 01:08:11.460\nYou throw that ampersand on the back and\n\n1282\n01:08:11.460 --> 01:08:16.310\nit knows to go back there and\njust run, and be happy, all right?\n\n1283\n01:08:16.310 --> 01:08:18.675\nSo, the ampersand is kind\nof a nice little shortcut.\n\n1284\n01:08:18.675 --> 01:08:22.433\nSo, now that those are running,\nif I run ps, I can see them.\n\n1285\n01:08:22.433 --> 01:08:28.770\nI can see midnight commander, I see MySQL,\nI see them running right there, right?\n\n1286\n01:08:28.770 --> 01:08:36.241\nIf we add an extra little bit\nto the ps command, ps -l, right?\n\n1287\n01:08:36.241 --> 01:08:38.120\nPs -l is our long form.\n\n1288\n01:08:38.120 --> 01:08:41.320\nAnd it will give us the long format read\nout of all these stuff when we move it\n\n1289\n01:08:41.320 --> 01:08:42.740\nup on my screen.\n\n1290\n01:08:42.740 --> 01:08:45.760\nAnd so you can see all sorts\nof crazy things in here.\n\n1291\n01:08:45.760 --> 01:08:48.030\nPID which we already needed, the user ID.\n\n1292\n01:08:48.030 --> 01:08:50.810\nAll sorts of other things in there.\n\n1293\n01:08:50.810 --> 01:08:53.010\nSome of this,\nnot stuff that we wanna mess with,\n\n1294\n01:08:53.010 --> 01:08:57.190\nlike the address size and all, stuff that\nreally doesn't matter to most of us.\n\n1295\n01:08:57.190 --> 01:09:00.090\nBut the one that I wanna point\nout is the column labeled, NI.\n\n1296\n01:09:01.300 --> 01:09:04.590\nNI is the niceness value, all right?\n\n1297\n01:09:04.590 --> 01:09:08.790\nAnd see how all of these processes\nare rated with a niceness of zero.\n\n1298\n01:09:08.790 --> 01:09:09.500\nIt's a tie.\n\n1299\n01:09:09.500 --> 01:09:10.420\nIt's a what is it,\n\n1300\n01:09:10.420 --> 01:09:14.690\na seven-way tie between all the processes\nI've run, they all have equal access.\n\n1301\n01:09:14.690 --> 01:09:18.900\nOkay, well when we run an application,\nwe can manipulate that niceness and\n\n1302\n01:09:18.900 --> 01:09:23.845\nit's gonna be a value that ranges from\nnegative 20, all the way to 19, okay?\n\n1303\n01:09:25.465 --> 01:09:28.505\nNegative 20 is the best.\n\n1304\n01:09:28.505 --> 01:09:30.965\nYou will get exclusive priority access,\n\n1305\n01:09:30.965 --> 01:09:34.765\nit's like being a gold card member\nof some credit card company.\n\n1306\n01:09:34.765 --> 01:09:37.693\nAnd you can jump right to the front of\nthe line and get access to that CPU and\n\n1307\n01:09:37.693 --> 01:09:39.085\nthat memory whenever you need it.\n\n1308\n01:09:39.085 --> 01:09:40.995\nYou are number one, right?\n\n1309\n01:09:40.995 --> 01:09:41.624\nNegative 20.\n\n1310\n01:09:42.770 --> 01:09:47.170\nPositive 19,\nyou're the lowest of the low, right?\n\n1311\n01:09:47.170 --> 01:09:50.080\nYou have to wait for everybody else\nbefore accessing the processor,\n\n1312\n01:09:50.080 --> 01:09:52.270\nyou will be low priority.\n\n1313\n01:09:52.270 --> 01:09:55.830\nEverybody else will be ranked better\nthan you, if you're number 19, right?\n\n1314\n01:09:55.830 --> 01:09:58.040\nBut then we've got all\nthe numbers in-between.\n\n1315\n01:09:58.040 --> 01:10:02.190\nWe've got negative 19,\nall the way to positive 18,\n\n1316\n01:10:02.190 --> 01:10:06.740\nthat we can assign to our processes\nto manipulate their priority,\n\n1317\n01:10:06.740 --> 01:10:10.310\nto give them more or\nless priority to the system, okay?\n\n1318\n01:10:10.310 --> 01:10:14.740\nSo, we can start to manipulate which\nof our programs are more important\n\n1319\n01:10:14.740 --> 01:10:15.700\nthan others.\n\n1320\n01:10:15.700 --> 01:10:18.240\nAnd on a workstation,\nwe don't normally worry about that.\n\n1321\n01:10:18.240 --> 01:10:21.180\nWhatever's in the foreground is what\nwe want to have priority, right?\n\n1322\n01:10:21.180 --> 01:10:25.479\nBut on a server, it's often that you have\nsome particular process that you want\n\n1323\n01:10:25.479 --> 01:10:28.815\nto have priority, the other web server or\na database server,\n\n1324\n01:10:28.815 --> 01:10:32.490\nmaybe you want the database server\nto have priority on that system.\n\n1325\n01:10:32.490 --> 01:10:34.710\nAnd so\nwe can manipulate that niceness value.\n\n1326\n01:10:34.710 --> 01:10:37.660\nThe default is zero, and\nyou gotta memorize this for\n\n1327\n01:10:37.660 --> 01:10:43.220\nthe exam, negative 20 is the best,\npositive 19 is the worst.\n\n1328\n01:10:43.220 --> 01:10:46.540\nNot intuitive, it's something that\nI've just memorized over the years, so\n\n1329\n01:10:46.540 --> 01:10:48.540\nit's just something you have to memorize.\n\n1330\n01:10:48.540 --> 01:10:49.740\nAll right.\n\n1331\n01:10:49.740 --> 01:10:53.020\nIf we wanna manipulate the niceness value,\nall right?\n\n1332\n01:10:53.020 --> 01:10:58.090\nThe best way to do it, I'll make MySQL\nget a little more priority, right?\n\n1333\n01:10:58.090 --> 01:11:04.310\nSo I'm gonna kill off %2, all right.\n\n1334\n01:11:04.310 --> 01:11:05.618\nSo I wanna run MySQL, but\n\n1335\n01:11:05.618 --> 01:11:09.840\nI wanna run it with higher priority\nthan the other stuff on my system.\n\n1336\n01:11:09.840 --> 01:11:14.512\nSo when I do that, I can run nice -n, and\n\n1337\n01:11:14.512 --> 01:11:17.548\nprovide a number, okay?\n\n1338\n01:11:17.548 --> 01:11:21.147\nI'm gonna run it as negative five.\n\n1339\n01:11:21.147 --> 01:11:24.444\nSo I'm gonna say nice -n,\nto give it the number, negative five.\n\n1340\n01:11:24.444 --> 01:11:27.640\nIf I leave the -n off,\nI believe the default is ten.\n\n1341\n01:11:27.640 --> 01:11:31.330\nLet me see what the default is.\n\n1342\n01:11:31.330 --> 01:11:33.150\nI'm pulling up the main page for nice.\n\n1343\n01:11:33.150 --> 01:11:34.770\nI see, let's see, negative 20, 19.\n\n1344\n01:11:34.770 --> 01:11:35.850\nYeah, default is ten.\n\n1345\n01:11:35.850 --> 01:11:39.868\nSo if I just do nice and a command,\nit's gonna get a default of ten.\n\n1346\n01:11:39.868 --> 01:11:41.408\nMy other stuff has a default of zero, so\n\n1347\n01:11:41.408 --> 01:11:44.272\nit's actually gonna make the command\nworse, lower priority, right?\n\n1348\n01:11:44.272 --> 01:11:49.527\nSo I'm gonna say nice -n, and\n\n1349\n01:11:49.527 --> 01:11:57.221\nI'm gonna add negative 5 to mysqld_safe.\n\n1350\n01:11:57.221 --> 01:12:00.243\nAnd I'll stick an ampersand on it so\nit just takes it and\n\n1351\n01:12:00.243 --> 01:12:02.530\nruns it in the background, okay.\n\n1352\n01:12:02.530 --> 01:12:07.200\nSo this is gonna adjust that\nniceness value, so there it goes.\n\n1353\n01:12:07.200 --> 01:12:10.780\nAnd if I do my ps-l, now when I look\n\n1354\n01:12:10.780 --> 01:12:16.250\nI can see mysqld_safe is running\nwith a niceness of negative five.\n\n1355\n01:12:16.250 --> 01:12:19.390\nNow to the untrained eye you look\nat it and you go, negative five,\n\n1356\n01:12:19.390 --> 01:12:20.700\nthat must be worse.\n\n1357\n01:12:20.700 --> 01:12:22.530\nBut the lower the number, the better.\n\n1358\n01:12:22.530 --> 01:12:25.140\nSo a negative 20 would\nbe the absolute best.\n\n1359\n01:12:25.140 --> 01:12:28.560\nAnd so because this is an easy one\nto confuse, it's a great one for\n\n1360\n01:12:28.560 --> 01:12:29.375\na question on the exam.\n\n1361\n01:12:29.375 --> 01:12:30.980\n>> Mm-hm, yeah.\n>> This is the kind of thing they look for\n\n1362\n01:12:30.980 --> 01:12:34.340\nis how well you understand\nthe information you're being shown.\n\n1363\n01:12:34.340 --> 01:12:36.680\nSo I've just adjusted that niceness value.\n\n1364\n01:12:36.680 --> 01:12:43.110\nAll right, that's the best way to adjust\nniceness is when you launch the program,\n\n1365\n01:12:43.110 --> 01:12:46.810\nuse the nice command to launch it and\nalter that priority, all right.\n\n1366\n01:12:46.810 --> 01:12:49.060\nBut you can alter it after the fact.\n\n1367\n01:12:49.060 --> 01:12:52.550\nIf you've already run it and\nyou want to change that niceness.\n\n1368\n01:12:52.550 --> 01:12:57.170\nSo maybe I want to take mysql and\n\n1369\n01:12:57.170 --> 01:13:01.970\nadjust this niceness from a negative\nfive down to a, or up to a negative ten.\n\n1370\n01:13:03.180 --> 01:13:05.440\nSo I want to boost it.\n\n1371\n01:13:05.440 --> 01:13:09.239\nAnd if you want to do that you\ncan use the renice command.\n\n1372\n01:13:09.239 --> 01:13:13.738\nAll right, renice lets you take something\nand basically just adjust it's priorities.\n\n1373\n01:13:13.738 --> 01:13:20.484\nSo you can say renice -n, and\nmaybe I'll go to negative 10,\n\n1374\n01:13:20.484 --> 01:13:26.212\nand then you need to specify\nthe PID if you've got it,\n\n1375\n01:13:26.212 --> 01:13:30.970\nand so I'll give it a PID and it is 6333.\n\n1376\n01:13:30.970 --> 01:13:32.150\nThere we go.\nSo it tells me\n\n1377\n01:13:32.150 --> 01:13:33.890\nthe old priority was a negative 5.\n\n1378\n01:13:33.890 --> 01:13:35.370\nThe new priority is a negative 10.\n\n1379\n01:13:35.370 --> 01:13:38.070\nAnd if I take a look at that.\n\n1380\n01:13:38.070 --> 01:13:40.480\nSure enough it's now a negative 10.\n\n1381\n01:13:40.480 --> 01:13:44.570\nI did not have to stop the program and\nstart it again.\n\n1382\n01:13:44.570 --> 01:13:46.150\nIt happened on it's own.\n\n1383\n01:13:46.150 --> 01:13:46.650\n>> Nice.\n\n1384\n01:13:47.890 --> 01:13:48.946\n>> All right, now another thing here.\n\n1385\n01:13:48.946 --> 01:13:50.529\nIf I look at my job.\n\n1386\n01:13:50.529 --> 01:13:52.620\nI'm just gonna kill that job off.\n\n1387\n01:13:52.620 --> 01:13:59.851\nLet's see, that is number four\nNow I'm really gonna have to wait,\n\n1388\n01:13:59.851 --> 01:14:02.750\ncuz it's got a niceness value that's so\nhigh, there we go.\n\n1389\n01:14:02.750 --> 01:14:06.696\nAll right so, so\nnow if I just run it again.\n\n1390\n01:14:09.362 --> 01:14:10.520\nSo there it goes running.\n\n1391\n01:14:12.900 --> 01:14:15.530\nNotice how the niceness value is now zero,\nall right,\n\n1392\n01:14:15.530 --> 01:14:20.520\nit does not save the niceness value,\nall right.\n\n1393\n01:14:20.520 --> 01:14:23.690\nYou have to use the nice command to do it.\n\n1394\n01:14:23.690 --> 01:14:28.110\nEither nice at the time of launching or\nrenice while it's running.\n\n1395\n01:14:28.110 --> 01:14:32.740\nAll right, so\njust be aware that we can adjust it.\n\n1396\n01:14:32.740 --> 01:14:33.940\nAll right.\n\n1397\n01:14:33.940 --> 01:14:39.730\nLet's see that pretty much takes care of\nour running processes and stuff like that.\n\n1398\n01:14:41.050 --> 01:14:43.960\nThe rest of the commands that we're\ngonna take a look at are all have to\n\n1399\n01:14:43.960 --> 01:14:45.390\ndeal with text manipulation.\n\n1400\n01:14:45.390 --> 01:14:47.640\nAnd I know that doesn't\nsound exciting at all, but\n\n1401\n01:14:47.640 --> 01:14:52.080\nyou will be surprised how often\nyou use this in the real world.\n\n1402\n01:14:52.080 --> 01:14:54.430\nSo that's what's gonna be coming up next.\n\n1403\n01:14:54.430 --> 01:14:57.730\nBut honestly, it's probably pretty good\nto spot for us to stop and take a break,\n\n1404\n01:14:57.730 --> 01:14:58.600\nwhat do you think, Ronnie?\n\n1405\n01:14:58.600 --> 01:14:59.196\n>> I think so.\n\n1406\n01:14:59.196 --> 01:15:00.947\nAll right, so ladies and gentlemen,\nlet's take a pause here.\n\n1407\n01:15:00.947 --> 01:15:03.220\nWhen we get back, text manipulation.\n\n1408\n01:15:03.220 --> 01:15:04.988\nYeah, you're on the edge of your seat,\nI know.\n\n1409\n01:15:04.988 --> 01:15:06.906\nBut stay tuned, we'll be back in a few.\n\n1410\n01:15:06.906 --> 01:15:08.237\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1411\n01:15:08.237 --> 01:15:13.279\n[MUSIC]\n\n1412\n01:15:13.279 --> 01:15:17.405\n[SOUND] All right, welcome back everybody.\n\n1413\n01:15:17.405 --> 01:15:20.920\nSo for our final segment we're\ngonna look at text manipulation.\n\n1414\n01:15:20.920 --> 01:15:23.770\nAnd I'm really gonna open up\nthe fire hose on commands here.\n\n1415\n01:15:23.770 --> 01:15:28.540\nWe got a ton of ways to manipulate\ntext in the Linux Unix world.\n\n1416\n01:15:28.540 --> 01:15:31.920\nAnd it all comes down to the fact that,\nwe work with stuff a lot,\n\n1417\n01:15:31.920 --> 01:15:35.690\nuser lists, file list, directory,\nthings of that nature.\n\n1418\n01:15:35.690 --> 01:15:39.160\nAnd we need to manipulate that text as\npart of getting our server up and running.\n\n1419\n01:15:39.160 --> 01:15:42.370\nNow, in the official exam objectives for\n\n1420\n01:15:42.370 --> 01:15:47.690\nthe first of the Linux+ exams,\nthey list a ton of commands.\n\n1421\n01:15:47.690 --> 01:15:49.330\nAnd I'm gonna talk about a lot of them.\n\n1422\n01:15:49.330 --> 01:15:51.370\nMost of them you just need to\nbe familiar with what they do,\n\n1423\n01:15:51.370 --> 01:15:55.600\nnot necessarily the full syntax, because\ntheir full syntax can be pretty daunting.\n\n1424\n01:15:55.600 --> 01:15:58.470\nBut it is a good idea to through and\nmess around with each one a little bit.\n\n1425\n01:15:58.470 --> 01:16:01.330\nSo I'm gonna go through and\nwe'll take a look at a lot of them.\n\n1426\n01:16:01.330 --> 01:16:04.650\nSome of them I'll spend more time on\nthan others, the real useful ones.\n\n1427\n01:16:04.650 --> 01:16:06.270\nBut the ones that are pretty rarely used,\n\n1428\n01:16:06.270 --> 01:16:09.450\nI'll talk about them, show them and\nkind of go from there.\n\n1429\n01:16:09.450 --> 01:16:13.785\nSo the first one that I wanna show is\na pretty useful one and it's called find.\n\n1430\n01:16:13.785 --> 01:16:16.880\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> The find command can be used to find\n\n1431\n01:16:16.880 --> 01:16:19.860\na file with a name that\nmatches a certain pattern.\n\n1432\n01:16:19.860 --> 01:16:20.590\nOkay?\n\n1433\n01:16:20.590 --> 01:16:23.610\nSo, for example,\nif I'm in my user directory here,\n\n1434\n01:16:23.610 --> 01:16:25.870\nI can see that I've got\nsome various files.\n\n1435\n01:16:25.870 --> 01:16:29.890\nIf I wanna find every\nfile that ends in .txt,\n\n1436\n01:16:29.890 --> 01:16:33.170\nI wanna find all the text\nfiles in my directory, okay?\n\n1437\n01:16:33.170 --> 01:16:38.060\nWell, here I've only got a few files, so I\ncan do ls and it'll show up there, right?\n\n1438\n01:16:38.060 --> 01:16:40.820\nAnd so, I don't really need\na special command for that.\n\n1439\n01:16:40.820 --> 01:16:46.840\nBut what if I'm looking for\na command in my sbin directory?\n\n1440\n01:16:47.840 --> 01:16:51.910\nHere, where I've got tons of files.\n\n1441\n01:16:51.910 --> 01:16:53.390\nTons of files in here.\n\n1442\n01:16:53.390 --> 01:16:58.450\nIt can be frustrating to kind of sift\nthrough and locate commands, okay.\n\n1443\n01:16:58.450 --> 01:17:01.470\nSo we can use the find\nutility to find that stuff.\n\n1444\n01:17:01.470 --> 01:17:03.620\nTo find files that match a certain name.\n\n1445\n01:17:03.620 --> 01:17:07.960\nSo the way we do it is we say find and\nthen we give it a path,\n\n1446\n01:17:07.960 --> 01:17:09.250\nwe tell it where to search.\n\n1447\n01:17:09.250 --> 01:17:11.155\nSo maybe I want to search\nmy home directory.\n\n1448\n01:17:11.155 --> 01:17:13.862\nSo I'll say find ~/.\n\n1449\n01:17:13.862 --> 01:17:17.100\nAnd then I need to tell it\nwhat I'm going to look for.\n\n1450\n01:17:17.100 --> 01:17:20.421\nAnd so in my case, I'm gonna say -name and\n\n1451\n01:17:20.421 --> 01:17:26.071\nthen in quotes I tell it what to look\nfrom I'm gonna say *.txt, right.\n\n1452\n01:17:26.071 --> 01:17:29.225\nStar is an asterisk cuz it's a wild card,\nso\n\n1453\n01:17:29.225 --> 01:17:32.654\nit means any file whose\nname is wherever .txt.\n\n1454\n01:17:32.654 --> 01:17:35.690\nWith .txt at the end, all right?\n\n1455\n01:17:35.690 --> 01:17:42.822\nSo this command says find in\nthis folder files named *.txt.\n\n1456\n01:17:42.822 --> 01:17:47.680\nAnd when I run that, it'll give\nme a list of what it found, okay?\n\n1457\n01:17:47.680 --> 01:17:51.500\nNow it did not find, you know what?\n\n1458\n01:17:51.500 --> 01:17:55.904\nI'm logged in as root, and in root,\nthat is the only text file.\n\n1459\n01:17:55.904 --> 01:18:02.572\nIn my own home directory, so\nif I look in /home/dpezet.\n\n1460\n01:18:02.572 --> 01:18:03.560\nThere we got.\n\n1461\n01:18:03.560 --> 01:18:07.440\nI've got a lot more, see right there, I\nget the additional text files that are in\n\n1462\n01:18:07.440 --> 01:18:10.750\nthe dpezet and I forgot that I\nhad switched to the root account.\n\n1463\n01:18:10.750 --> 01:18:12.760\nSo the find command can\nbe pretty powerful.\n\n1464\n01:18:12.760 --> 01:18:17.970\nMaybe I, I've got VMware installed,\nand when you've got VMware and\n\n1465\n01:18:17.970 --> 01:18:20.600\nthe VM tools, there's all sorts\nof commands that it adds.\n\n1466\n01:18:20.600 --> 01:18:27.330\nSo maybe I wanna find out what tools I've\ngot, so I might search /user/sbin for\n\n1467\n01:18:27.330 --> 01:18:31.720\nfiles with a name that contains *vm*.\n\n1468\n01:18:31.720 --> 01:18:35.030\nAny file that has vm in the name, okay.\n\n1469\n01:18:35.030 --> 01:18:36.640\nSo I can run that, and there we go.\n\n1470\n01:18:36.640 --> 01:18:41.359\nI've got vmtoolssd,\nvmware-rpctool, vmblock-fuse, so\n\n1471\n01:18:41.359 --> 01:18:45.460\nsome of the different\nutilities that show up, right?\n\n1472\n01:18:45.460 --> 01:18:49.350\nSo there's variations of this command\nthat can be really effective just for\n\n1473\n01:18:49.350 --> 01:18:52.400\nlocating and finding things, all right.\n\n1474\n01:18:52.400 --> 01:18:55.320\nIn fact, I mentioned earlier\nin this show that CentOS\n\n1475\n01:18:55.320 --> 01:18:58.660\nhas a release file that's stored\nsomewhere, I just can't remember.\n\n1476\n01:18:58.660 --> 01:19:07.187\nSo I could actually do\na find / -name *release*.\n\n1477\n01:19:07.187 --> 01:19:10.020\nI'm forgetting my quotes,\nthat won't get be good.\n\n1478\n01:19:10.020 --> 01:19:10.890\nThere.\n\n1479\n01:19:10.890 --> 01:19:13.510\nAnd that'll search\nthe entire hard drive and\n\n1480\n01:19:13.510 --> 01:19:17.380\ngive me a list of files that\ncontain the name release.\n\n1481\n01:19:17.380 --> 01:19:18.960\nAnd-\n>> No.\n\n1482\n01:19:18.960 --> 01:19:20.750\n>> There might be a couple.\n\n1483\n01:19:20.750 --> 01:19:21.810\nSo, there it is.\n\n1484\n01:19:21.810 --> 01:19:22.825\nSee, the file command.\n\n1485\n01:19:22.825 --> 01:19:25.940\n/etc/centos-release.\n\n1486\n01:19:25.940 --> 01:19:31.100\nSo, if I look at that file, there we go,\n\n1487\n01:19:31.100 --> 01:19:32.750\nI can see that I'm running\nCentOs release 6.5.\n\n1488\n01:19:32.750 --> 01:19:34.870\nThat was that file I was\ntalking about earlier.\n\n1489\n01:19:34.870 --> 01:19:37.840\nSo the find command is pretty handy,\nwe can find stuff.\n\n1490\n01:19:39.070 --> 01:19:40.020\n>> Nice.\n\n1491\n01:19:40.020 --> 01:19:44.430\n>> Now the find command is looking for\nfile names, in this case.\n\n1492\n01:19:44.430 --> 01:19:48.800\nWhat if we want to find something\nthat's inside of the file, right?\n\n1493\n01:19:48.800 --> 01:19:52.620\nSo, for example, if I have something\nlike a big log file, right?\n\n1494\n01:19:52.620 --> 01:19:56.690\nA log file might contain\na ton of information so, for\n\n1495\n01:19:56.690 --> 01:19:58.921\nexample, if I run Dmesg_.\n\n1496\n01:19:58.921 --> 01:20:02.900\nThis shows some of the hardware\ndetection when a system boots up.\n\n1497\n01:20:04.210 --> 01:20:08.280\nAnd if I run dmesg_,\nit's a lot of stuff there talking about\n\n1498\n01:20:08.280 --> 01:20:10.970\nall the different things that were\ndetected when the system booted up.\n\n1499\n01:20:10.970 --> 01:20:14.650\nWe're gonna see it more when we\nget into the architecture shows.\n\n1500\n01:20:14.650 --> 01:20:19.450\nBut if I wanna find information on there\nabout one of my hard drives, right?\n\n1501\n01:20:19.450 --> 01:20:21.470\nMy SDA hard drive, right?\n\n1502\n01:20:21.470 --> 01:20:23.240\nI wanna find that information about it.\n\n1503\n01:20:23.240 --> 01:20:26.970\nWell, I need a way to\nsearch through that text\n\n1504\n01:20:26.970 --> 01:20:30.020\nto find lines that\ninclude a certain stream.\n\n1505\n01:20:30.020 --> 01:20:33.360\nAnd the utility for that is grep.\n\n1506\n01:20:33.360 --> 01:20:37.370\nGrep is an awesome utility\nthat I use almost everyday.\n\n1507\n01:20:37.370 --> 01:20:40.070\nYou can quickly scan through log files and\ntext files and\n\n1508\n01:20:40.070 --> 01:20:42.890\nfind exactly what it is\nyou are looking for.\n\n1509\n01:20:42.890 --> 01:20:46.030\nAnd the grep command has\na pretty simple syntax.\n\n1510\n01:20:46.030 --> 01:20:49.410\nWe say grep, and then we told\nit the string we're looking for.\n\n1511\n01:20:49.410 --> 01:20:52.050\nAnd then we told it what to look into,\nright?\n\n1512\n01:20:52.050 --> 01:20:55.957\nSo I might be looking for,\nwhat do I have in here?\n\n1513\n01:20:55.957 --> 01:21:00.055\nLet me create a file real quick.\n\n1514\n01:21:02.934 --> 01:21:04.560\nOops.\n\n1515\n01:21:04.560 --> 01:21:05.895\nThis is a test.\n\n1516\n01:21:08.577 --> 01:21:11.337\nSo I might want to look inside that file,\n\n1517\n01:21:11.337 --> 01:21:15.160\nactually let me modify that\nfile just a little bit more.\n\n1518\n01:21:17.222 --> 01:21:19.550\nAll right, so I've got this is a test.\n\n1519\n01:21:20.950 --> 01:21:23.040\nThis is not a test.\n\n1520\n01:21:23.040 --> 01:21:24.160\nAnd this is a test.\n\n1521\n01:21:25.280 --> 01:21:28.770\nAll right, so\nmaybe I will look in that file and\n\n1522\n01:21:28.770 --> 01:21:32.600\nI just wanna see the lines that\ncontain the word not, right?\n\n1523\n01:21:32.600 --> 01:21:38.088\nI could do more test.txt and then go\nthrough and visually find the ones I want.\n\n1524\n01:21:38.088 --> 01:21:40.491\nBut what if that text file\nhas a million entries in it?\n\n1525\n01:21:40.491 --> 01:21:43.750\nI just want to see the lines\nthat contain the word not.\n\n1526\n01:21:43.750 --> 01:21:53.400\nSo I can say grep \"not\" ./test.txt,\nso I'm saying look in that file,\n\n1527\n01:21:53.400 --> 01:21:57.270\nand in that file show me the lines\nthat contain the word not.\n\n1528\n01:21:57.270 --> 01:21:59.510\nAnd when I run it,\nthat's what it gives me.\n\n1529\n01:21:59.510 --> 01:22:01.990\nEvery line that contains the word not.\n\n1530\n01:22:01.990 --> 01:22:06.120\nThis is incredibly useful for\nparsing log files.\n\n1531\n01:22:06.120 --> 01:22:11.608\nSo when I ran that dmesg command,\nthat was a ton of stuff.\n\n1532\n01:22:11.608 --> 01:22:15.943\nThere's only a handful of lines in there\nthat apply to my hard drive, to sda.\n\n1533\n01:22:15.943 --> 01:22:19.683\nSo I might want to run dmesg and\n\n1534\n01:22:19.683 --> 01:22:26.340\npipe that into grep and\nlook for sda like that.\n\n1535\n01:22:26.340 --> 01:22:32.460\nSo I'm saying take the output of dmesg,\nand make that input to grep.\n\n1536\n01:22:32.460 --> 01:22:36.380\nAnd in grep,\ngive me just the lines that contain sda.\n\n1537\n01:22:37.630 --> 01:22:41.600\nNow it's gonna run, and\nits much, much smaller.\n\n1538\n01:22:41.600 --> 01:22:45.140\nNow it's just what, maybe 15 lines\nright there, easy for me to read.\n\n1539\n01:22:45.140 --> 01:22:47.550\nI can see it detect to\nthe drive right here,\n\n1540\n01:22:47.550 --> 01:22:50.810\nI can see that it's not\ndoing caching apparently.\n\n1541\n01:22:50.810 --> 01:22:54.800\nIt's attached to a SCSI disk,\nit's attached to an LVM, so I can see all\n\n1542\n01:22:54.800 --> 01:22:58.640\nthe information I'm looking for without\nhaving to sift through that log, right?\n\n1543\n01:22:58.640 --> 01:23:00.920\nHopefully you can see how useful that is.\n\n1544\n01:23:00.920 --> 01:23:04.070\nGrep, I literally do use\nit every single day.\n\n1545\n01:23:04.070 --> 01:23:08.150\nWe use it on Cisco routers, it's a really\ncommon thing to be able to parse and\n\n1546\n01:23:08.150 --> 01:23:10.180\nfind exactly what you're looking for.\n\n1547\n01:23:11.320 --> 01:23:13.830\nNow, grep is very, very powerful.\n\n1548\n01:23:13.830 --> 01:23:15.650\nIt's got a lot of switches.\n\n1549\n01:23:15.650 --> 01:23:21.760\nFor example, when I ran show me the lines\nthat contain the word not in my test file,\n\n1550\n01:23:21.760 --> 01:23:27.020\nright, I could also have done a -v,\nwhich is the inverse.\n\n1551\n01:23:27.020 --> 01:23:29.490\n>> Hm.\n>> Show me the lines that don't include\n\n1552\n01:23:29.490 --> 01:23:32.390\nthe word not, and\nnow I get the other ones.\n\n1553\n01:23:32.390 --> 01:23:36.220\nSo if I have a log file that's been\nspammed with some garbage entry,\n\n1554\n01:23:36.220 --> 01:23:40.330\nI can do a gwrap-v and\nexclude that garbage entry,\n\n1555\n01:23:40.330 --> 01:23:43.620\nand then when I run it, it'll give me\nthe rest of the log file minus that.\n\n1556\n01:23:43.620 --> 01:23:44.240\n-v is pretty useful.\n\n1557\n01:23:46.278 --> 01:23:50.877\nAll right, some of the other things that\nwe might wanna do, if you're getting a lot\n\n1558\n01:23:50.877 --> 01:23:54.950\nof lines back, then you might want to\ndo a -n which will add line numbers so\n\n1559\n01:23:54.950 --> 01:23:58.810\nwhen it outputs it'll tell you what\nline number it is in the file.\n\n1560\n01:23:58.810 --> 01:24:02.230\nSo line number three contains\nthis is a test, all right?\n\n1561\n01:24:02.230 --> 01:24:04.200\nSo -n gives you those line numbers.\n\n1562\n01:24:04.200 --> 01:24:08.036\nThat's very handy for developers,\nor for modifying config files,\n\n1563\n01:24:08.036 --> 01:24:11.619\nwe know right where in the config\nfile to go and find out setting.\n\n1564\n01:24:11.619 --> 01:24:15.205\nSo for example, if I'm dealing with,\n\n1565\n01:24:15.205 --> 01:24:19.346\nI don't have a web server\ninstalled on here.\n\n1566\n01:24:22.857 --> 01:24:25.170\nLike this vimrc file, right?\n\n1567\n01:24:25.170 --> 01:24:30.230\nIf I wanna modify how much of\na history it's keeping track, right?\n\n1568\n01:24:30.230 --> 01:24:38.960\nI could say grep -n \"History\" ./vimrc.\n\n1569\n01:24:38.960 --> 01:24:44.160\nSo, look in the vimrc file, find any\nline that contains the word history,\n\n1570\n01:24:44.160 --> 01:24:47.008\nand show it to me.\n\n1571\n01:24:47.008 --> 01:24:51.180\nContains set history=50,\nit's gonna keep 50 commands for me.\n\n1572\n01:24:51.180 --> 01:24:52.190\nBut if I wanna change that,\n\n1573\n01:24:52.190 --> 01:24:56.660\nI can now edit it, I know to go right to\nline 11 and change that value, right.\n\n1574\n01:24:56.660 --> 01:24:58.335\nSo grep, very powerful.\n\n1575\n01:25:01.597 --> 01:25:04.994\nThere's a bunch of other command\nline switches with grep, and\n\n1576\n01:25:04.994 --> 01:25:08.197\nreading the man file is actually\npretty good on this one, so\n\n1577\n01:25:08.197 --> 01:25:11.658\nyou should you should probably\nshould go though and read it, but\n\n1578\n01:25:11.658 --> 01:25:15.730\nyou'll see some of them are things\nlike -E for using regular expression.\n\n1579\n01:25:15.730 --> 01:25:16.788\nI'll talk about those in a minute.\n\n1580\n01:25:16.788 --> 01:25:21.110\nWe'll see -F, which does fixed strings.\n\n1581\n01:25:21.110 --> 01:25:27.000\nLooking for a particular string in\nother words if I give a word like, run.\n\n1582\n01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:28.290\nDon't find running.\n\n1583\n01:25:28.290 --> 01:25:29.710\nJust find run.\n\n1584\n01:25:29.710 --> 01:25:31.260\nRight?\nA fixed string length.\n\n1585\n01:25:31.260 --> 01:25:32.770\nThis is what we're looking for.\n\n1586\n01:25:32.770 --> 01:25:38.160\nAnd then you'll see -R, which is in\nhere somewhere, which is recursive.\n\n1587\n01:25:38.160 --> 01:25:40.820\nAnd that means,\nif we're pointing it at a directory,\n\n1588\n01:25:40.820 --> 01:25:44.370\nto look at all the files in that\ndirectory, and the subdirectory.\n\n1589\n01:25:44.370 --> 01:25:47.960\nCuz you can run grep against\nmore than one file, right?\n\n1590\n01:25:47.960 --> 01:25:54.680\nI didn't show that, but\nI might want to look through all the files\n\n1591\n01:25:54.680 --> 01:25:58.720\nin my directory here, and find any of\nthe ones that contain the word test.\n\n1592\n01:25:58.720 --> 01:26:04.110\nSo I might say grep \"test\" ./* right,\n\n1593\n01:26:04.110 --> 01:26:09.970\nlook in all of my files and give me\nany line that contains the word test.\n\n1594\n01:26:09.970 --> 01:26:11.250\nAll right, and there it goes.\n\n1595\n01:26:11.250 --> 01:26:15.560\nSo it tells me,\nit found the word test in install.log and\n\n1596\n01:26:15.560 --> 01:26:18.430\nit found it in test.txt three times,\nright.\n\n1597\n01:26:19.630 --> 01:26:23.631\nAnd I might want to add\n-n to get line numbers.\n\n1598\n01:26:23.631 --> 01:26:25.238\nSo now I can find exactly where it is, and\n\n1599\n01:26:25.238 --> 01:26:27.427\ninstall that log online 356\nhere had the word test.\n\n1600\n01:26:27.427 --> 01:26:29.020\nAll right.\n\n1601\n01:26:29.020 --> 01:26:32.700\nAnd see the word test was actually\nthe part of the word fastest mirror.\n\n1602\n01:26:32.700 --> 01:26:34.315\nSo wasn't even truly test.\n\n1603\n01:26:34.315 --> 01:26:35.880\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1604\n01:26:35.880 --> 01:26:36.530\n>> All right.\n\n1605\n01:26:36.530 --> 01:26:40.290\nAnd if we add that -r,\nnow, it's recursive, so\n\n1606\n01:26:40.290 --> 01:26:42.750\nit'll look at my subfolders also.\n\n1607\n01:26:42.750 --> 01:26:46.580\nAnd so, it'll scan and now,\nI got a lot more containing test, right?\n\n1608\n01:26:46.580 --> 01:26:51.200\nAnd looked in all of those subfolders,\nso we're just adding the -r, right?\n\n1609\n01:26:51.200 --> 01:26:56.140\nNow, many Unix systems contain aliases for\nthese cuz a lot of people use them, so\n\n1610\n01:26:56.140 --> 01:27:00.078\nyou'll see egrep and\n\n1611\n01:27:00.078 --> 01:27:04.050\nfgrep and rgrep.\n\n1612\n01:27:04.050 --> 01:27:10.570\nAnd all those are are aliases for\nbasically grep-e, grep-f, and grep-r.\n\n1613\n01:27:10.570 --> 01:27:13.560\nE and F are normally capitalized though,\n\n1614\n01:27:13.560 --> 01:27:15.630\nwhen you use them as\na command line modifier.\n\n1615\n01:27:15.630 --> 01:27:18.420\nBut the r for recursive is lower-case.\n\n1616\n01:27:18.420 --> 01:27:22.230\nSo if you see mention of these other\ncommands, egrep, fgrep, rgrep,\n\n1617\n01:27:22.230 --> 01:27:24.400\nthey're just aliases to grep.\n\n1618\n01:27:24.400 --> 01:27:28.828\nAnd you can achieve the same thing, so\ngrep -E is the same thing as egrep.\n\n1619\n01:27:28.828 --> 01:27:31.979\nAnd grep -F is the same thing as fgrep and\nso on.\n\n1620\n01:27:33.520 --> 01:27:34.200\nAll right.\n\n1621\n01:27:34.200 --> 01:27:37.110\nNow, I use grep all the time.\n\n1622\n01:27:37.110 --> 01:27:39.080\nAnd I use it mostly with the pipe command.\n\n1623\n01:27:40.150 --> 01:27:45.210\nIf I do ps aux, I'm often looking for\na particular process.\n\n1624\n01:27:45.210 --> 01:27:46.633\nI don't want to have to sift\nthrough all this stuff.\n\n1625\n01:27:46.633 --> 01:27:53.050\nSo I might do ps aux, and pipe that into\ngrep and look for \"mysqld\" all right.\n\n1626\n01:27:53.050 --> 01:27:55.790\nJust show me the SQL stuff,\nI don't need the rest.\n\n1627\n01:27:55.790 --> 01:27:58.110\nAnd when I run that, here it is.\n\n1628\n01:27:58.110 --> 01:28:01.050\nHere's the lines containing my SQL D.\n\n1629\n01:28:01.050 --> 01:28:01.600\nOkay.\n\n1630\n01:28:01.600 --> 01:28:05.545\nSo we can quickly and easily look and\nfind that stuff and filter it out.\n\n1631\n01:28:05.545 --> 01:28:07.550\n>> Um-hm.\n>> Or if I just want to see the processes\n\n1632\n01:28:07.550 --> 01:28:09.680\nrunning for user dpezet.\n\n1633\n01:28:09.680 --> 01:28:11.460\nSo I can punch in dpezet.\n\n1634\n01:28:11.460 --> 01:28:12.870\nAnd then here they are.\n\n1635\n01:28:12.870 --> 01:28:15.070\nI keep using quotes that's not a habit.\n\n1636\n01:28:15.070 --> 01:28:17.900\nYou only have to use quotes if\nyou have like spaces and involve.\n\n1637\n01:28:17.900 --> 01:28:20.660\nIf you don't have any spaces you\ncan leave the quotes off and\n\n1638\n01:28:20.660 --> 01:28:24.670\nhere's all the processes type to me\nwhich would include not only the process\n\n1639\n01:28:24.670 --> 01:28:29.580\nhas actually tied to me, these two but\nit includes the logins that were run.\n\n1640\n01:28:29.580 --> 01:28:33.120\nAnd notice it caught the the grep\ncommand the root is running because it's\n\n1641\n01:28:33.120 --> 01:28:35.020\ngot dpezet in it also.\n\n1642\n01:28:35.020 --> 01:28:36.810\nSo a nice way to filter that output.\n\n1643\n01:28:39.320 --> 01:28:40.210\nAll right.\n\n1644\n01:28:40.210 --> 01:28:42.220\nI showed the pipe command\nin the last episodes.\n\n1645\n01:28:42.220 --> 01:28:42.960\nThat's not a new one.\n\n1646\n01:28:42.960 --> 01:28:44.620\nDefinitely remember that.\n\n1647\n01:28:44.620 --> 01:28:45.820\nThere's also the greater than.\n\n1648\n01:28:45.820 --> 01:28:46.820\nDid we do greater than?\n\n1649\n01:28:46.820 --> 01:28:47.700\n>> We didn't.\n\n1650\n01:28:47.700 --> 01:28:48.210\n>> We didn't.\n\n1651\n01:28:48.210 --> 01:28:49.420\nOkay.\n\n1652\n01:28:49.420 --> 01:28:52.460\nThe greater than prompt\nis another nice one.\n\n1653\n01:28:52.460 --> 01:28:55.180\nWhen I take a look at\nsomething like ps aux,\n\n1654\n01:28:55.180 --> 01:28:59.530\nby default it's going to what's\ncalled the standard out or STD out,\n\n1655\n01:28:59.530 --> 01:29:04.070\nstandard out, and the standard output\nis your screen, your monitor, right.\n\n1656\n01:29:04.070 --> 01:29:06.360\nYou can change it to be like\na serial port or whatever but\n\n1657\n01:29:06.360 --> 01:29:07.560\nit's normally your monitor.\n\n1658\n01:29:07.560 --> 01:29:08.240\nRight.\n\n1659\n01:29:08.240 --> 01:29:11.275\nSo if I just run PS aux,\nthe standard out is the monitor.\n\n1660\n01:29:11.275 --> 01:29:13.015\nThat's where it goes.\n\n1661\n01:29:13.015 --> 01:29:16.455\nBut I can use the greater\nthan symbol to say,\n\n1662\n01:29:16.455 --> 01:29:20.025\ntake that output and\nput it somewhere else.\n\n1663\n01:29:20.025 --> 01:29:21.765\nOkay, you can do null.\n\n1664\n01:29:21.765 --> 01:29:23.080\nThat says just throw it away.\n\n1665\n01:29:23.080 --> 01:29:24.350\nDon't display it, just get rid of it.\n\n1666\n01:29:24.350 --> 01:29:25.670\nWho cares right?\n\n1667\n01:29:25.670 --> 01:29:29.870\nBut more often then not\nwe do it to a file.\n\n1668\n01:29:29.870 --> 01:29:31.590\nAnd so I'm gonna output to process.txt.\n\n1669\n01:29:31.590 --> 01:29:35.580\nAnd when I do that, there is goes, and\n\n1670\n01:29:35.580 --> 01:29:41.440\nit created a process.txt file\nwhich I can see right here.\n\n1671\n01:29:41.440 --> 01:29:42.500\nAnd the output is in that.\n\n1672\n01:29:42.500 --> 01:29:44.140\nI thought we did that in the last show.\n\n1673\n01:29:44.140 --> 01:29:45.210\nBut maybe we didn't.\n\n1674\n01:29:45.210 --> 01:29:48.410\nSo if I take a look at that file,\nthere it is.\n\n1675\n01:29:48.410 --> 01:29:52.710\nThere's that process output and it's\nnow saved and I've got a record of it.\n\n1676\n01:29:52.710 --> 01:29:54.552\nOkay.\n\n1677\n01:29:54.552 --> 01:29:59.770\nSo the pipe symbol says take the output in\none command feed it as input to another.\n\n1678\n01:29:59.770 --> 01:30:02.700\nThe greater-than symbol says take\nthe output of one command and\n\n1679\n01:30:02.700 --> 01:30:05.056\nstick it somewhere else, stick it in a,\na file or somewhere else, right.\n\n1680\n01:30:05.056 --> 01:30:13.410\nNow what if you want the output\nto go to a file and your screen?\n\n1681\n01:30:13.410 --> 01:30:14.240\nOkay.\n\n1682\n01:30:14.240 --> 01:30:17.220\nWell by default it doesn't do that.\n\n1683\n01:30:17.220 --> 01:30:19.726\nThe graded and\nsymbols just goes into a file.\n\n1684\n01:30:19.726 --> 01:30:23.570\nSo there is another command called Tee,\nT-E-E.\n\n1685\n01:30:23.570 --> 01:30:25.740\nAnd Tee will do both.\n\n1686\n01:30:25.740 --> 01:30:27.490\nIt'll sent the video to your standard out,\n\n1687\n01:30:27.490 --> 01:30:32.150\nor the applet to your standard out,\nand it'll write it to a file.\n\n1688\n01:30:32.150 --> 01:30:39.210\nSo I could have done ps aux and\npipe that into the tee command\n\n1689\n01:30:39.210 --> 01:30:43.860\nand specified I'll do\nprocesss2.txt this time right.\n\n1690\n01:30:43.860 --> 01:30:47.554\nSo it's gonna output the data to a second\nfile or a file called process.2txt.\n\n1691\n01:30:48.700 --> 01:30:49.970\nAnd I get it on my screen.\n\n1692\n01:30:49.970 --> 01:30:54.750\nSo there's the output on my screen, and\nif I do a an ls-la I can see process\n\n1693\n01:30:54.750 --> 01:30:58.240\ntwo right there, and\nthen output it to both, okay.\n\n1694\n01:30:58.240 --> 01:31:01.700\nSo if you just want it to go to a file,\nchoose a greater than symbol.\n\n1695\n01:31:01.700 --> 01:31:02.920\nSend it straight in there.\n\n1696\n01:31:02.920 --> 01:31:04.980\nBut if you wanted to go to video and\n\n1697\n01:31:04.980 --> 01:31:08.775\nthe file you've got to pipe it into the\ntee command and it will take care of that.\n\n1698\n01:31:08.775 --> 01:31:12.310\nT-e-e.\n\n1699\n01:31:12.310 --> 01:31:15.160\nAll right, what others ones do we have?\n\n1700\n01:31:15.160 --> 01:31:15.830\nWhat's that?\n\n1701\n01:31:15.830 --> 01:31:17.050\n>> XRs.\n\n1702\n01:31:17.050 --> 01:31:18.110\n>> XRs.\nXR is a hard one.\n\n1703\n01:31:18.110 --> 01:31:19.070\nLet's.\n>> Okay.\n\n1704\n01:31:19.070 --> 01:31:19.570\n>> Let's wait.\n\n1705\n01:31:22.764 --> 01:31:24.365\nWell I'm trying to think of.\n\n1706\n01:31:24.365 --> 01:31:25.650\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> A good example on XR.\n\n1707\n01:31:25.650 --> 01:31:31.660\nSo sometimes the output that we get is\nnot formatted the way we want it and\n\n1708\n01:31:31.660 --> 01:31:35.060\nwe can use a utility called\nXRs to manipulate that.\n\n1709\n01:31:35.060 --> 01:31:36.290\nTechnically T is doing that.\n\n1710\n01:31:36.290 --> 01:31:39.940\nT is taking our video output and\nmanipulating it by saving in the file and\n\n1711\n01:31:39.940 --> 01:31:40.680\ndisplaying it on screen.\n\n1712\n01:31:40.680 --> 01:31:42.220\nThat doesn't really change it.\n\n1713\n01:31:42.220 --> 01:31:43.260\nActually changes it.\n\n1714\n01:31:43.260 --> 01:31:46.040\nSo we can do that.\n\n1715\n01:31:48.260 --> 01:31:49.110\nYeah, well let's do it.\n\n1716\n01:31:49.110 --> 01:31:55.860\nSo for example,\nif I want to find some files, okay.\n\n1717\n01:31:55.860 --> 01:31:59.890\nAnd then I wanna take those files and\nwhat do I want to do,\n\n1718\n01:31:59.890 --> 01:32:01.320\ndo I want to delete them or?\n\n1719\n01:32:01.320 --> 01:32:02.400\nYeah.\nLet's say I want to delete them,\n\n1720\n01:32:02.400 --> 01:32:04.580\nI want to delete a series of files.\n\n1721\n01:32:04.580 --> 01:32:06.880\nAnd I want to delete the files\nthat have a certain name.\n\n1722\n01:32:06.880 --> 01:32:10.915\nSo let's say here,\nI'm just gonna create some files.\n\n1723\n01:32:10.915 --> 01:32:16.443\nfile1.txt, file2.txt, and file3.txt.\n\n1724\n01:32:16.443 --> 01:32:17.060\nOkay.\n\n1725\n01:32:17.060 --> 01:32:21.220\nSo if I look I've got file1,\nfile2, file3.txt.\n\n1726\n01:32:21.220 --> 01:32:26.010\nIf I want to delete them all, okay well\nthe easiest way would be to be like rm-\n\n1727\n01:32:26.010 --> 01:32:29.756\nrf file?.txt.\n\n1728\n01:32:29.756 --> 01:32:33.300\nFile?.txt.\n\n1729\n01:32:33.300 --> 01:32:36.690\nNormally we use as a wild card and\nmeans anything.\n\n1730\n01:32:36.690 --> 01:32:39.250\nSo I could say file*.txt.\n\n1731\n01:32:39.250 --> 01:32:41.970\nBut that star could be one or\nmore characters.\n\n1732\n01:32:41.970 --> 01:32:47.150\nSo it could be file123.text, it could be\nfileabc.text, and it would match that.\n\n1733\n01:32:47.150 --> 01:32:52.650\nA question mark means any single\ncharacter, so file one, or\n\n1734\n01:32:52.650 --> 01:32:58.230\nreally file zero through file nine .txt,\nand file a through file z.txt would match.\n\n1735\n01:32:58.230 --> 01:33:02.770\nSo here I'm saying look for file?.txt and\nthat's what I wanna remove.\n\n1736\n01:33:02.770 --> 01:33:04.900\nOkay, well that works,\n\n1737\n01:33:04.900 --> 01:33:08.990\nI can use that question mark\nwildcard just like the asterisk one.\n\n1738\n01:33:08.990 --> 01:33:13.240\nBut what if I wanna remove\nevery file called file.txt,\n\n1739\n01:33:13.240 --> 01:33:16.560\nfile something dot text\nacross my entire hard drive.\n\n1740\n01:33:16.560 --> 01:33:19.050\nScan the entire hard drive and\nwipe these out.\n\n1741\n01:33:19.050 --> 01:33:19.750\nOkay.\n\n1742\n01:33:19.750 --> 01:33:22.863\nWell for that I'm probably gonna\nneed to use the find command\n\n1743\n01:33:22.863 --> 01:33:24.277\nto find gave them, right.\n\n1744\n01:33:24.277 --> 01:33:28.293\nSo I want to find in my home directory,\n\n1745\n01:33:28.293 --> 01:33:33.346\nany file that's called filequestion.text.\n\n1746\n01:33:33.346 --> 01:33:34.358\nWhoops.\n\n1747\n01:33:34.358 --> 01:33:37.058\nIt would help it I stick quotes on that.\n\n1748\n01:33:37.058 --> 01:33:40.439\nOr not.\n\n1749\n01:33:40.439 --> 01:33:43.820\nWhat have I done wrong here?\n\n1750\n01:33:43.820 --> 01:33:48.035\n\"File?.txt\", that is right.\n\n1751\n01:33:54.803 --> 01:33:57.183\nWhat have I done to break my find command?\n\n1752\n01:33:57.183 --> 01:33:58.348\n>> You need name.\n\n1753\n01:33:58.348 --> 01:34:00.095\n>> Shoot thank you Ronnie.\n\n1754\n01:34:00.095 --> 01:34:01.830\n-name there we go.\n\n1755\n01:34:01.830 --> 01:34:04.780\nSo if you leave that -name off, it doesn't\nknow how to look for the fie name.\n\n1756\n01:34:04.780 --> 01:34:06.210\nIt just looks for every files.\n\n1757\n01:34:06.210 --> 01:34:08.049\nThat's why is out putting\nevery single file for me.\n\n1758\n01:34:08.049 --> 01:34:09.811\nSo let me just put this\nback the way it was.\n\n1759\n01:34:09.811 --> 01:34:11.252\nThere, all right.\n\n1760\n01:34:11.252 --> 01:34:14.580\nSo now, it's looking for\nany file that matches that name.\n\n1761\n01:34:14.580 --> 01:34:19.965\nOkay, now I could pipe that\noutput into the RM command.\n\n1762\n01:34:19.965 --> 01:34:24.375\nI could say find and change it from\ntilt slash to just straight up slash,\n\n1763\n01:34:24.375 --> 01:34:29.650\nsearch the entire hard drive for\nanything called file?.txt and wipe it out.\n\n1764\n01:34:29.650 --> 01:34:32.640\nAnd then pipe that into rm- rf and\nthat's gonna wipe them out.\n\n1765\n01:34:32.640 --> 01:34:33.410\nRight.\n\n1766\n01:34:33.410 --> 01:34:35.900\nBut there's a slight problem here.\n\n1767\n01:34:35.900 --> 01:34:41.940\nThe way those files are listed is one\nafter the other on a separate line.\n\n1768\n01:34:41.940 --> 01:34:46.310\nThat output is not what\nrm- rf is going to expect.\n\n1769\n01:34:46.310 --> 01:34:50.010\nSo when I pipe that output into rm-rf,\nthere I did it.\n\n1770\n01:34:50.010 --> 01:34:52.620\nAnd when I look see how\nthe files are still there?\n\n1771\n01:34:52.620 --> 01:34:55.090\nThe output is not in the right format.\n\n1772\n01:34:55.090 --> 01:34:59.420\nIf you look at the man page for RM,\nif you want to delete more than one file,\n\n1773\n01:34:59.420 --> 01:35:01.730\nthey've gotta be one after the other.\n\n1774\n01:35:01.730 --> 01:35:06.302\nSo if I wanted to delete those,\nI'd have to say\n\n1775\n01:35:06.302 --> 01:35:11.390\n./file1.text ,./file2txt and so on.\n\n1776\n01:35:11.390 --> 01:35:17.340\nOne after the other like this, and that's\nnot the output that find is giving me.\n\n1777\n01:35:17.340 --> 01:35:24.040\nWhen I ran find,\nit gave me them one after the other.\n\n1778\n01:35:25.350 --> 01:35:30.010\nSo I need to manipulate that,\nand that's where xargs comes in.\n\n1779\n01:35:30.010 --> 01:35:36.110\nXargs can take multiple arguments,\nthese right here, and reorganize them.\n\n1780\n01:35:36.110 --> 01:35:40.007\nAnd it's got a ton of manipulations, but\nthere's really one that we use the most,\n\n1781\n01:35:40.007 --> 01:35:43.459\nand that is taking a sequenced list\nlike this and putting them in order, so\n\n1782\n01:35:43.459 --> 01:35:45.648\nwe can delete them with\ncommands like rm -rf.\n\n1783\n01:35:45.648 --> 01:35:49.598\nSo what I can do is I can take\nthis same command that failed for\n\n1784\n01:35:49.598 --> 01:35:53.079\nme a moment ago, and\nI'm gonna add in an extra pipe.\n\n1785\n01:35:53.079 --> 01:35:57.329\nAnd I'm gonna pipe that into xargs, okay?\n\n1786\n01:35:57.329 --> 01:36:02.511\nWhen we pipe that into xarg, we're\ntelling it, hey we need to reorganize\n\n1787\n01:36:02.511 --> 01:36:07.040\nthis stuff to get it into a way that\nis ready for us to mess with it.\n\n1788\n01:36:07.040 --> 01:36:10.520\nAnd I don't really even have to\ndo too terribly much more to it.\n\n1789\n01:36:10.520 --> 01:36:16.050\nWhen we say xargs rm -rf,\n\n1790\n01:36:16.050 --> 01:36:20.780\nI'm saying reorganize these arguments\nthat I'm passing and send it into rm -rf.\n\n1791\n01:36:20.780 --> 01:36:26.480\nAnd when I run that, I can now take\na look and those files are gone.\n\n1792\n01:36:26.480 --> 01:36:31.880\nOkay, all it did by calling xargs was to\n\n1793\n01:36:31.880 --> 01:36:36.240\ntake those arguments, take those one after\nthe others and stick them in order, right.\n\n1794\n01:36:36.240 --> 01:36:39.730\nSo pretty cool simple manipulation there\nto change the way that data comes out.\n\n1795\n01:36:39.730 --> 01:36:41.690\nVery handy with the pipe command.\n\n1796\n01:36:41.690 --> 01:36:44.990\nI really don't ever use xargs\nwithout a pipe command.\n\n1797\n01:36:44.990 --> 01:36:47.350\nIt's almost always when you've\ngot output in the wrong way,\n\n1798\n01:36:47.350 --> 01:36:48.750\nand then you feed it into that.\n\n1799\n01:36:50.150 --> 01:36:51.970\nAlright so that is xargs.\n\n1800\n01:36:51.970 --> 01:36:54.620\nAnd let me go back because there were\na couple of other commands on my last page\n\n1801\n01:36:54.620 --> 01:36:55.680\nthat I wanted to get to.\n\n1802\n01:36:57.440 --> 01:36:58.860\nSo that's another one.\n\n1803\n01:36:58.860 --> 01:37:01.320\nA few other things, we've used more and\n\n1804\n01:37:01.320 --> 01:37:04.600\nless to be able to output\nthe text from a file.\n\n1805\n01:37:04.600 --> 01:37:08.330\nSometimes you don't want the whole file,\nyou don't want a particular line, either.\n\n1806\n01:37:08.330 --> 01:37:10.910\nMaybe you just want\nthe last couple of lines.\n\n1807\n01:37:10.910 --> 01:37:12.950\nLet's say I'm troubleshooting USB.\n\n1808\n01:37:12.950 --> 01:37:17.700\nEvery time I plug in a USB device, its\nhardware, that's protected by the system,\n\n1809\n01:37:17.700 --> 01:37:22.230\nand D message shows me hardware\ndetected by the system, right?\n\n1810\n01:37:22.230 --> 01:37:26.070\nBut, if I don't know what\nthe USB device's name is,\n\n1811\n01:37:26.070 --> 01:37:28.110\nI can't really search for it, can I?\n\n1812\n01:37:28.110 --> 01:37:31.010\nSo, I may just want to see\nthe most recent events.\n\n1813\n01:37:31.010 --> 01:37:36.990\nThe last few lines of that system, and\nto do that I can use the tail command.\n\n1814\n01:37:36.990 --> 01:37:41.710\nIf I say dmesg and\nI pipe that into the tail command,\n\n1815\n01:37:43.010 --> 01:37:45.650\nthat's gonna say just show\nme the last few lines.\n\n1816\n01:37:45.650 --> 01:37:47.590\nAnd there we go,\nI think it defaults to 10 lines.\n\n1817\n01:37:47.590 --> 01:37:49.000\nAnd so here's the last 10.\n\n1818\n01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:54.932\nSo what I can do is I can plug in the USB\ndevice and then do dmsg typed in to tail.\n\n1819\n01:37:55.980 --> 01:37:58.880\nAnd there's the last ten lines that\nshould show the device being detected.\n\n1820\n01:38:00.160 --> 01:38:02.350\nTail shows the last few lines.\n\n1821\n01:38:02.350 --> 01:38:06.570\nYou also have head that\nshows the first few lines.\n\n1822\n01:38:06.570 --> 01:38:07.770\nI think it defaults to ten also,\n\n1823\n01:38:07.770 --> 01:38:10.710\nit's showing me the first ten\nlines when the system booted up.\n\n1824\n01:38:10.710 --> 01:38:12.270\nNow let me clear this out.\n\n1825\n01:38:12.270 --> 01:38:13.970\nLooks like some of those\nlines are pretty long ones.\n\n1826\n01:38:15.200 --> 01:38:15.990\nThere we go.\n\n1827\n01:38:15.990 --> 01:38:18.601\nSo I get the first handful\nof lines that it outputs so\n\n1828\n01:38:18.601 --> 01:38:21.350\nthat I can see the information\nat the top of that file.\n\n1829\n01:38:21.350 --> 01:38:25.391\nSo, head and tail,\nthe beginning and the end, and they\n\n1830\n01:38:25.391 --> 01:38:30.860\nhave command modifiers where you can\nchange the amount of data that it outputs.\n\n1831\n01:38:30.860 --> 01:38:35.470\nYou can do it by bytes with dash c, and\nlines is what we normally do, dash n.\n\n1832\n01:38:35.470 --> 01:38:39.020\nAnd specify how many lines we want.\n\n1833\n01:38:39.020 --> 01:38:39.710\nAll right.\n\n1834\n01:38:39.710 --> 01:38:40.850\nSo head and tail,\n\n1835\n01:38:40.850 --> 01:38:46.325\nlet's see what are the other ones here,\nyeah those guys all right so.\n\n1836\n01:38:46.325 --> 01:38:47.590\n[LAUGH] Let me say this.\n\n1837\n01:38:47.590 --> 01:38:50.900\n>> Yeah.\n>> There's a lot of commands that are in\n\n1838\n01:38:50.900 --> 01:38:54.790\nthe official exam objectives that Idon't\nuse very often most people don't, but\n\n1839\n01:38:54.790 --> 01:38:56.490\nthey can be useful.\n\n1840\n01:38:56.490 --> 01:39:02.280\nThere's some like NL,\nwhen we output a file, we look at a file,\n\n1841\n01:39:02.280 --> 01:39:05.820\nit doesn't have line numbers by default\nand we might want to add them, right?\n\n1842\n01:39:05.820 --> 01:39:07.420\nRemember when I did the G Rep command,\n\n1843\n01:39:07.420 --> 01:39:10.360\nit had a dash N we could use\nto through in line numbers.\n\n1844\n01:39:10.360 --> 01:39:11.730\nBut what about other things?\n\n1845\n01:39:11.730 --> 01:39:13.870\nWhat about dmessage?\n\n1846\n01:39:13.870 --> 01:39:17.270\nWhen I do dmessage,\nthere's no line numbers on that.\n\n1847\n01:39:17.270 --> 01:39:19.630\nSo what you can do is,\nyou can use the nl command.\n\n1848\n01:39:19.630 --> 01:39:23.125\nYou can do dmesg, and pipe it into nl.\n\n1849\n01:39:23.125 --> 01:39:26.275\nAnd that's gonna stick line\nnumbers on that output, and\n\n1850\n01:39:26.275 --> 01:39:29.225\nso now you can see it and\nit's got a nice little line number.\n\n1851\n01:39:29.225 --> 01:39:33.055\nAll right, you can see why I don't use\nthat that often, cuz something like dmesg\n\n1852\n01:39:33.055 --> 01:39:35.705\nchanges all the time, so we don't\nnecessarily need line numbers, but\n\n1853\n01:39:35.705 --> 01:39:38.305\nif you wanna inject them into\nsomething here's a great way to do it.\n\n1854\n01:39:39.800 --> 01:39:40.560\nLet's see.\n\n1855\n01:39:40.560 --> 01:39:41.760\nWe got pr.\n\n1856\n01:39:41.760 --> 01:39:43.980\nPr is to paginate it for printing.\n\n1857\n01:39:43.980 --> 01:39:47.685\nTo get that ready if you're gonna print\nout dmesg, which I probably never do.\n\n1858\n01:39:47.685 --> 01:39:50.010\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> When you run it, you'll notice.\n\n1859\n01:39:50.010 --> 01:39:52.670\nActually, how can we see that?\n\n1860\n01:39:52.670 --> 01:39:54.740\nIf I pipe that into less will we see it?\n\n1861\n01:39:54.740 --> 01:39:55.250\nYeah.\n\n1862\n01:39:55.250 --> 01:39:58.590\nSee how it added page one and\nthe date right there.\n\n1863\n01:39:58.590 --> 01:40:00.130\nAnd then here's some stuff.\n\n1864\n01:40:00.130 --> 01:40:01.030\nAnd then it breaks.\n\n1865\n01:40:01.030 --> 01:40:03.490\nAnd then there's page two and the date.\n\n1866\n01:40:03.490 --> 01:40:05.300\nAnd there's page three.\n\n1867\n01:40:05.300 --> 01:40:08.600\nSo it's adding that pagination\nlike you were going to print.\n\n1868\n01:40:08.600 --> 01:40:10.810\nThat's what pr does.\n\n1869\n01:40:10.810 --> 01:40:13.520\nNl adds line numbers, pr does pagination.\n\n1870\n01:40:13.520 --> 01:40:15.770\nAnd remember, you can combine these.\n\n1871\n01:40:15.770 --> 01:40:18.630\nSo I can do where I take dmesg and\n\n1872\n01:40:18.630 --> 01:40:22.480\nI pipe it into nl and\nthen I pipe that into pr, right.\n\n1873\n01:40:22.480 --> 01:40:25.210\nAnd then I'm gonna pipe\nthat whole thing into less.\n\n1874\n01:40:25.210 --> 01:40:27.060\nTaking the output from one\nas the input to the other.\n\n1875\n01:40:27.060 --> 01:40:29.610\nYou can do this over and over and\nover again as many times as you want.\n\n1876\n01:40:29.610 --> 01:40:31.610\nThe order is important though, right.\n\n1877\n01:40:31.610 --> 01:40:36.392\nBecause if I look at this,\nI want to attach the line numbers before I\n\n1878\n01:40:36.392 --> 01:40:39.240\npaginate it, and so\nthat's what I've done here.\n\n1879\n01:40:39.240 --> 01:40:42.500\nAnd so you'll see the line numbers,\nI stop at 56 there.\n\n1880\n01:40:42.500 --> 01:40:45.170\nPage two starts with 57 and continues on.\n\n1881\n01:40:45.170 --> 01:40:49.070\nIf I got that backwards, if I did\n\n1882\n01:40:50.470 --> 01:40:55.290\npagination first, and\nthen do the line numbers, right?\n\n1883\n01:40:55.290 --> 01:40:58.790\nLook what happens,\nthat header got a line number.\n\n1884\n01:40:58.790 --> 01:41:02.250\nAnd when we get to the pagination,\nif we take a look at and\n\n1885\n01:41:02.250 --> 01:41:03.990\nit's still preserved there 57 to 58.\n\n1886\n01:41:03.990 --> 01:41:07.630\nBut a line number is attached\nto that pagination value so\n\n1887\n01:41:07.630 --> 01:41:09.180\nthat's not necessarily\nsomething that we want.\n\n1888\n01:41:11.440 --> 01:41:12.510\nSo be careful with the order.\n\n1889\n01:41:12.510 --> 01:41:16.230\nBut you can nest multiple\ncommands together.\n\n1890\n01:41:16.230 --> 01:41:17.520\nLet's see.\n\n1891\n01:41:17.520 --> 01:41:18.020\nWC.\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1892\n01:41:18.020 --> 01:41:19.525\n>> WC is a command that useful.\n\n1893\n01:41:19.525 --> 01:41:21.110\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's funny for our British viewers so\n\n1894\n01:41:21.110 --> 01:41:24.290\nthat means that bathroom,\nbut it really only used for\n\n1895\n01:41:24.290 --> 01:41:28.280\ncollege kids because when you're in\ncollege what do your professors tell you.\n\n1896\n01:41:28.280 --> 01:41:30.740\nYou need to write a 1,500 word essay,\nblah, blah, blah.\n\n1897\n01:41:30.740 --> 01:41:33.420\nThey always tell you a word count,\nand that's what wc does.\n\n1898\n01:41:33.420 --> 01:41:34.500\nIt actually does a bunch of things.\n\n1899\n01:41:34.500 --> 01:41:38.080\nIt does a line count, a word count,\nand a character count.\n\n1900\n01:41:38.080 --> 01:41:40.580\nSo, you can say wc and a file.\n\n1901\n01:41:40.580 --> 01:41:42.470\nSo, I think I got a an install log here,\ndon't I?\n\n1902\n01:41:42.470 --> 01:41:43.100\nYeah.\n\n1903\n01:41:43.100 --> 01:41:46.051\nSo I'll do a word count\non this install log.\n\n1904\n01:41:46.051 --> 01:41:52.406\nAnd when I do that it will tell\nme that there's 6,023 lines,\n\n1905\n01:41:52.406 --> 01:41:57.156\n1,264 words, 27,312 characters.\n\n1906\n01:41:57.156 --> 01:41:58.400\nWC, just a quick word count\nif we need to see it.\n\n1907\n01:41:59.540 --> 01:42:04.870\nIt's also a good way to see if\nthere's two files that are identical.\n\n1908\n01:42:04.870 --> 01:42:08.390\nSee how I've got install.log and\ninstall.log.syslog?\n\n1909\n01:42:08.390 --> 01:42:10.150\nMaybe I think they're the same.\n\n1910\n01:42:10.150 --> 01:42:12.980\nI could do wc on install.log.\n\n1911\n01:42:12.980 --> 01:42:17.350\nThen I could do it on the other one and\nI can see that they are very different.\n\n1912\n01:42:17.350 --> 01:42:19.521\nOne's only got 953 lines.\n\n1913\n01:42:19.521 --> 01:42:24.190\nProbably could have told that from\nfile size though, it would be easier.\n\n1914\n01:42:24.190 --> 01:42:26.400\n[LAUGH] That takes care\nof those little ones.\n\n1915\n01:42:26.400 --> 01:42:29.590\nLike I said those are our one that I don't\nuse terribly often but they are there.\n\n1916\n01:42:32.120 --> 01:42:35.640\nAll right, now I've mentioned that\nthere are some shells, like a CSH,\n\n1917\n01:42:35.640 --> 01:42:37.190\nlike a seashell,\n\n1918\n01:42:37.190 --> 01:42:42.120\nthat let you do near programming-like\nactivities right from the command line.\n\n1919\n01:42:42.120 --> 01:42:45.810\nWell, a big part of working with any kind\nof programming is that you're normally\n\n1920\n01:42:45.810 --> 01:42:47.260\ngoing to deal with variables.\n\n1921\n01:42:47.260 --> 01:42:50.490\nAnd we have variables inside of our shell.\n\n1922\n01:42:50.490 --> 01:42:53.850\nIf you run the set command, S-E-T.\n\n1923\n01:42:53.850 --> 01:42:57.990\nThe set command will give you a list of\nall the variables that are available and\n\n1924\n01:42:57.990 --> 01:42:59.420\nthat are already present.\n\n1925\n01:42:59.420 --> 01:43:03.240\nSo I can see like, pwd,\nthe present working directory.\n\n1926\n01:43:03.240 --> 01:43:05.150\nWhen you run the pwd command,\n\n1927\n01:43:05.150 --> 01:43:07.710\nall it's really doing is showing\nyou what's in that variable.\n\n1928\n01:43:07.710 --> 01:43:10.730\nAnd as you move around your system, so\n\n1929\n01:43:10.730 --> 01:43:14.280\nif I start navigating into\nsome different directories.\n\n1930\n01:43:14.280 --> 01:43:15.840\nPWD is changing.\n\n1931\n01:43:15.840 --> 01:43:18.730\nBut so is the PWD variable.\n\n1932\n01:43:18.730 --> 01:43:22.485\nSo I can see it right there,\nit's changed right there.\n\n1933\n01:43:22.485 --> 01:43:25.516\nSo the PWD command is really just\nreflecting whatever that variable\n\n1934\n01:43:25.516 --> 01:43:26.106\nis, right?\n\n1935\n01:43:26.106 --> 01:43:30.320\nYou can see my prompt right\nthere /username at /host name.\n\n1936\n01:43:30.320 --> 01:43:32.505\n/W is working directory, right?\n\n1937\n01:43:32.505 --> 01:43:34.129\nThat's where it's getting\ninformation from the prompt.\n\n1938\n01:43:36.310 --> 01:43:40.068\nAll right,\nyou can manipulate these pretty easily.\n\n1939\n01:43:40.068 --> 01:43:45.629\nThe set command displays them but\nany variable can be overridden.\n\n1940\n01:43:45.629 --> 01:43:50.166\nIf I wanna change my prompt to\nmaybe not include my username.\n\n1941\n01:43:50.166 --> 01:43:56.055\nI could say PS1 = and then I could come\nin and specify what I want it to be.\n\n1942\n01:43:56.055 --> 01:44:00.652\nAnd I could just say, I want the host\nname but I don't want the username.\n\n1943\n01:44:00.652 --> 01:44:04.920\nAnd for the working directory, I'll\nput that in or maybe I don't even want\n\n1944\n01:44:04.920 --> 01:44:08.539\nthe working directory,\nmaybe I just wanna leave that one out.\n\n1945\n01:44:08.539 --> 01:44:12.619\nAnd then we got to do a \\$ for\nour privilege level and then our space, so\n\n1946\n01:44:12.619 --> 01:44:15.747\nwe have a little bit of gap\nbetween our prompt and that.\n\n1947\n01:44:15.747 --> 01:44:19.850\nSo I might run something like this and\nthat's gonna modify my prompt.\n\n1948\n01:44:19.850 --> 01:44:23.840\nAnd so now I an see my prompt just\nsays local host, and that's it.\n\n1949\n01:44:23.840 --> 01:44:27.150\nAnd so now no matter where change if\nI go back to my home directory or\n\n1950\n01:44:27.150 --> 01:44:33.360\nwhatever the prompt just\ndisplays the host name.\n\n1951\n01:44:33.360 --> 01:44:36.090\nNow, running set command,\nthis how I can see those variables.\n\n1952\n01:44:36.090 --> 01:44:39.160\nBut I might not wanna hunt and peck\nthrough there to find the variable that I\n\n1953\n01:44:39.160 --> 01:44:43.510\nset, so another way that we can\nview them is you can say, echo.\n\n1954\n01:44:43.510 --> 01:44:48.740\nEcho just exports some kind of text to\nyour screen, and we could echo a file,\n\n1955\n01:44:48.740 --> 01:44:50.330\nand it would print that\nfile on the screen.\n\n1956\n01:44:50.330 --> 01:44:51.670\nWe could echo text, you could say,\n\n1957\n01:44:51.670 --> 01:44:56.830\n\"Hello world\" like that, and\nit just writes Hello world.\n\n1958\n01:44:56.830 --> 01:45:02.835\nBut you can also say, echo $, and\nthen any variable name you want.\n\n1959\n01:45:02.835 --> 01:45:07.759\nSo I could say, echo $PS1, and\nit will show me my shell prompt.\n\n1960\n01:45:07.759 --> 01:45:11.614\nThere is the prompt for my shell,\nand how we have it defined.\n\n1961\n01:45:11.614 --> 01:45:15.701\nSo echo is a great way to\nverify what those are.\n\n1962\n01:45:15.701 --> 01:45:19.475\nI can set variables,\nyou can make them up as you go.\n\n1963\n01:45:19.475 --> 01:45:24.369\nSo maybe I have something like\nan awesomeness rating that's on a scale of\n\n1964\n01:45:24.369 --> 01:45:25.890\n1 to 10.\n\n1965\n01:45:25.890 --> 01:45:31.496\nSo I might set my AWESOMENESS=10,\nthings are awesome.\n\n1966\n01:45:31.496 --> 01:45:36.893\nAnd then whenever I want,\nI can just do echo $, percent in windows,\n\n1967\n01:45:36.893 --> 01:45:42.118\n$AWESOMENESS, and now I can see\nmy awesomeness level is at 10.\n\n1968\n01:45:42.118 --> 01:45:48.954\nAnd if I no longer need that,\nI can just do unset $AWESOMENESS.\n\n1969\n01:45:48.954 --> 01:45:52.600\nAnd now if I try and echo $AWESOMENESS,\nit comes back as empty cuz it's not set.\n\n1970\n01:45:53.650 --> 01:45:58.408\nSo set displays your variables,\nunset empties your variables.\n\n1971\n01:45:58.408 --> 01:46:00.860\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And the variable name equals something,\n\n1972\n01:46:00.860 --> 01:46:03.640\nis what will actually set\nthe variable to a value.\n\n1973\n01:46:03.640 --> 01:46:06.180\nBe careful with that cuz a lot of\npeople think they can use the set\n\n1974\n01:46:06.180 --> 01:46:07.470\ncommand to set a variable.\n\n1975\n01:46:07.470 --> 01:46:08.640\nThat's not what it does.\n\n1976\n01:46:08.640 --> 01:46:11.360\nIt shows you the variables\nthat are already set.\n\n1977\n01:46:11.360 --> 01:46:15.390\nTo set a variable you just type its NAME=\nand then whatever you want it to be.\n\n1978\n01:46:19.779 --> 01:46:20.695\nCool.\n\n1979\n01:46:20.695 --> 01:46:24.939\n>> So those are variables you can use them\nfor all sort of different things there\n\n1980\n01:46:24.939 --> 01:46:28.532\nare session variables that are in\nplace for a quite a few things.\n\n1981\n01:46:28.532 --> 01:46:29.866\nYou'll see your bash config,\n\n1982\n01:46:29.866 --> 01:46:32.339\nthe colors for\nthe directory colors which are turned on.\n\n1983\n01:46:32.339 --> 01:46:33.686\nYou can turn that off, if you want.\n\n1984\n01:46:33.686 --> 01:46:37.064\nYou'll see all sorts of stuff in there.\n\n1985\n01:46:37.064 --> 01:46:39.143\nLet's see, what are some others?\n\n1986\n01:46:39.143 --> 01:46:40.490\nI think we're getting\ndown towards the end.\n\n1987\n01:46:40.490 --> 01:46:43.533\nWe've only got a few more, I know we're\nrunning a little over on time on this\n\n1988\n01:46:43.533 --> 01:46:46.262\nsegment but let's get through it,\nwe've only got a handful left.\n\n1989\n01:46:46.262 --> 01:46:47.285\n>> That's right.\n\n1990\n01:46:47.285 --> 01:46:51.797\n>> There's another command that is\na powerful command, which is sed.\n\n1991\n01:46:51.797 --> 01:46:56.690\nSed is a string editor, it's designed\nto basically make changes to a file.\n\n1992\n01:46:56.690 --> 01:46:59.770\nWe know we can use vi to\nopen up a file and edit it.\n\n1993\n01:46:59.770 --> 01:47:03.870\nSed, you can tell it what to do and\nit'll edit the file and\n\n1994\n01:47:03.870 --> 01:47:05.360\nmake the changes for you.\n\n1995\n01:47:05.360 --> 01:47:06.482\nIt's incredibly powerful.\n\n1996\n01:47:06.482 --> 01:47:09.715\nYou can tell it what line to go to,\nwhat text to add, what text to remove,\n\n1997\n01:47:09.715 --> 01:47:11.843\nwhat text to change,\nsuper, super powerful.\n\n1998\n01:47:11.843 --> 01:47:16.220\nThere are entire books on\nthe said command alone.\n\n1999\n01:47:16.220 --> 01:47:18.379\nThere's one from O'Reilly\nthat's really good.\n\n2000\n01:47:18.379 --> 01:47:21.589\nIt's like this thick,\ntons of variations to it.\n\n2001\n01:47:22.810 --> 01:47:27.279\nBut as an administrator, one of the things\nthat we mainly do with it is we look for\n\n2002\n01:47:27.279 --> 01:47:28.696\na string and replace it.\n\n2003\n01:47:28.696 --> 01:47:32.899\nWe use sed as a tech replacement tool,\nit's almost always what we do.\n\n2004\n01:47:32.899 --> 01:47:40.226\nSo I might have a file,\nlet's create one here.\n\n2005\n01:47:40.226 --> 01:47:43.116\nWell let's take that test.txt file.\n\n2006\n01:47:43.116 --> 01:47:49.851\nAnd I'm gonna come in here and\nI'm gonna put in that,\n\n2007\n01:47:49.851 --> 01:47:54.460\nI love Blackberry phones!!!\n\n2008\n01:47:54.460 --> 01:48:01.820\nAnd so I made this file in 1995, and\n[LAUGH] so I love Blackberry phones!!!\n\n2009\n01:48:01.820 --> 01:48:03.400\nBut boy, the times have changed.\n\n2010\n01:48:03.400 --> 01:48:04.870\nAnd so now, I decide you know what?\n\n2011\n01:48:04.870 --> 01:48:09.989\nI hate Blackberry phones, so\nI can use the said command to go and\n\n2012\n01:48:09.989 --> 01:48:13.283\nswap out the word love for the word hate.\n\n2013\n01:48:13.283 --> 01:48:16.127\nSo [LAUGH] this is like the opposite\nlesson we should teach our children.\n\n2014\n01:48:16.127 --> 01:48:22.510\nSo I'm gonna use sed, and I'm gonna use\nthe string replace or the swap command.\n\n2015\n01:48:22.510 --> 01:48:25.941\nAnd there are so\nmany other commands on sed, believe me.\n\n2016\n01:48:25.941 --> 01:48:29.740\nGo out and read some of the files, the man\nfiles and stuff, there's so much in there.\n\n2017\n01:48:29.740 --> 01:48:34.350\nBut I'm gonna do a string replace, and\nI'm gonna look for the word love and\n\n2018\n01:48:34.350 --> 01:48:36.330\nreplace it with the word hate.\n\n2019\n01:48:37.480 --> 01:48:41.600\nSo that's the old text\nfollowed by the new text and\n\n2020\n01:48:41.600 --> 01:48:44.450\nthen I need to tell it the file\nthat I'm manipulating.\n\n2021\n01:48:44.450 --> 01:48:48.774\nNow the file, if I just wanna\ndo it right in that file and\n\n2022\n01:48:48.774 --> 01:48:51.976\nbe done with it, I can specify the name.\n\n2023\n01:48:51.976 --> 01:48:53.919\nWas it file.text?\n\n2024\n01:48:53.919 --> 01:48:56.900\nShoot, test.text.\n\n2025\n01:48:58.285 --> 01:49:01.890\nSed is so powerful it's\nextremely easy to make mistakes.\n\n2026\n01:49:01.890 --> 01:49:05.875\nSo a lot of time what we wanna do is\nexport this as a separate filename,\n\n2027\n01:49:05.875 --> 01:49:06.849\na new filename.\n\n2028\n01:49:07.900 --> 01:49:11.570\nSo what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna\nuse some interesting syntax here.\n\n2029\n01:49:11.570 --> 01:49:16.200\nNormally, we use the greater than symbol\nto take data and stick it in a file.\n\n2030\n01:49:16.200 --> 01:49:19.610\nWhen you wanna get data out of a file,\nyou use the less than symbol.\n\n2031\n01:49:19.610 --> 01:49:26.078\nSo I'm gonna say get your\ninformation from test.txt and\n\n2032\n01:49:26.078 --> 01:49:30.130\nthen stick it into >test1.txt.\n\n2033\n01:49:30.130 --> 01:49:32.865\nSo make the changes,\nbut output a new file.\n\n2034\n01:49:32.865 --> 01:49:34.760\nThat way I still have the original\nin case I mess things up.\n\n2035\n01:49:37.244 --> 01:49:40.471\nWhen you run that,\nsed is gonna scan your file and\n\n2036\n01:49:40.471 --> 01:49:44.742\nevery instance of the word love\nis gonna change to the word hate.\n\n2037\n01:49:44.742 --> 01:49:49.310\nAnd now it's gonna output test1.txt and\nwe should see our change.\n\n2038\n01:49:49.310 --> 01:49:55.040\nIf I do more test1.txt, there it is.\n\n2039\n01:49:55.040 --> 01:49:56.816\nNow, I hate Blackberry phones!!!\n\n2040\n01:49:56.816 --> 01:50:00.830\nSo really cool, because sed can just\nget in there and make that change.\n\n2041\n01:50:00.830 --> 01:50:05.570\nIf you want a script or automated\nchange across hundreds of servers,\n\n2042\n01:50:05.570 --> 01:50:10.569\nyou can use sed to edit those files,\nmake your changes, very powerful.\n\n2043\n01:50:11.648 --> 01:50:12.773\n>> Very nice.\n\n2044\n01:50:12.773 --> 01:50:16.593\n>> I'm down to just six more commands-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n2045\n01:50:16.593 --> 01:50:17.898\n>> And these are really,\n\n2046\n01:50:17.898 --> 01:50:19.414\nreally simple commands.\n\n2047\n01:50:19.414 --> 01:50:23.945\nWhen we get screen output, if we\nwanna feed that into another command,\n\n2048\n01:50:23.945 --> 01:50:27.053\nsometimes the screen output\nis not right for us.\n\n2049\n01:50:27.053 --> 01:50:30.436\nIt just contains too much information or\nnot enough information, and\n\n2050\n01:50:30.436 --> 01:50:32.120\nwe need to manipulate it.\n\n2051\n01:50:32.120 --> 01:50:35.930\nSo there's a series of commands that\nwe can use to kinda tailor what we get.\n\n2052\n01:50:37.570 --> 01:50:39.610\nTr is one of them.\n\n2053\n01:50:39.610 --> 01:50:42.808\nTr, I always call it the trim command.\n\n2054\n01:50:42.808 --> 01:50:46.514\nIt actually stands for translate,\nI don't know why that is,\n\n2055\n01:50:46.514 --> 01:50:50.808\nbut it's a trim command that we can\nuse to modify how text is displayed.\n\n2056\n01:50:50.808 --> 01:50:53.304\nIt's got a few different forms,\n\n2057\n01:50:53.304 --> 01:50:57.414\nthe one I mostly use is\nthe squeeze form which is tr-s.\n\n2058\n01:50:57.414 --> 01:51:01.070\nYou can do tr-d to delete\ncharacters out of something.\n\n2059\n01:51:02.110 --> 01:51:06.880\nFor example,\nlet's say that I go to my ls -la output.\n\n2060\n01:51:08.120 --> 01:51:11.583\nIt outputs all this information,\nand it's close to what I want.\n\n2061\n01:51:11.583 --> 01:51:13.650\nI wanna get a list of files\nin my home directory.\n\n2062\n01:51:14.660 --> 01:51:19.170\nIf I just do ls, I get them, but\nthey're not in the right format for me.\n\n2063\n01:51:19.170 --> 01:51:22.790\nSo I want them all vertically,\njust a list of the files.\n\n2064\n01:51:22.790 --> 01:51:26.163\nAnd if I do ls -la I get that, but\nthere's a lot of other data in here.\n\n2065\n01:51:26.163 --> 01:51:29.510\nSo maybe I just wanna get\nthe data that's over here,\n\n2066\n01:51:29.510 --> 01:51:33.730\nthe filenames as they're\nfloating over here and that's it.\n\n2067\n01:51:33.730 --> 01:51:36.148\nWell, I need to cut out all\nthis other information and\n\n2068\n01:51:36.148 --> 01:51:37.668\nthere is actually a cut command.\n\n2069\n01:51:37.668 --> 01:51:41.112\nWe'll see where we could cut that out,\ncut those characters out and\n\n2070\n01:51:41.112 --> 01:51:42.450\nget to just the filename.\n\n2071\n01:51:42.450 --> 01:51:46.200\nBut there's also the availability\nto base it on the columns.\n\n2072\n01:51:46.200 --> 01:51:49.207\nSo I've got one column of data here,\nanother here, another here, another here.\n\n2073\n01:51:49.207 --> 01:51:52.335\nBut in order to do that we have\nto have some kind of delimiter.\n\n2074\n01:51:52.335 --> 01:51:56.493\nAnd you'll see in this command\nsometimes that delimiter is one space.\n\n2075\n01:51:56.493 --> 01:51:59.685\nSometimes it's two spaces,\nalways one space right here.\n\n2076\n01:51:59.685 --> 01:52:04.710\nBut here it might be five spaces, six\nspaces so it's not a standard delimiter.\n\n2077\n01:52:04.710 --> 01:52:08.900\nWe can use tr with the squeeze\nmodifier to change these, so\n\n2078\n01:52:08.900 --> 01:52:11.110\nthey all have the same delimiter.\n\n2079\n01:52:11.110 --> 01:52:16.330\nSo I could say ls- la, and feed that into\n\n2080\n01:52:16.330 --> 01:52:23.310\nthe squeeze modifier of tr and\ntell it to look for something like spaces.\n\n2081\n01:52:23.310 --> 01:52:24.370\nActually is it double quotes?\n\n2082\n01:52:24.370 --> 01:52:26.150\nI think it is single quotes.\n\n2083\n01:52:26.150 --> 01:52:28.090\nSo look for spaces and\n\n2084\n01:52:28.090 --> 01:52:31.760\nanytime there's more than one space in\na row, squeeze it to a single space.\n\n2085\n01:52:33.155 --> 01:52:36.840\nAnd when I run that,\nI'll see that my output is the same.\n\n2086\n01:52:36.840 --> 01:52:40.072\nIt's just now there's never\nmore than one space in a row.\n\n2087\n01:52:40.072 --> 01:52:44.590\nSo that translate or tr command is\nletting me collapse those characters.\n\n2088\n01:52:46.300 --> 01:52:49.490\nNow, I can take this and\nfeed it into something like cut.\n\n2089\n01:52:49.490 --> 01:52:55.460\nThe cut command, let's us cut out\na certain piece of text that we want.\n\n2090\n01:52:55.460 --> 01:52:58.790\nAnd you can do it based on\nwhere it's located numerically,\n\n2091\n01:52:58.790 --> 01:53:02.160\nthe 50th character to the 55th\ncharacter if you want.\n\n2092\n01:53:02.160 --> 01:53:06.970\nBut when you got a column data like this,\nit's better to grab a particular column.\n\n2093\n01:53:06.970 --> 01:53:08.860\nSo we can feed in a few different things.\n\n2094\n01:53:10.040 --> 01:53:13.552\nIf we just wanted to do by character,\nI could count these characters here,\n\n2095\n01:53:13.552 --> 01:53:14.504\nthis boring.\n\n2096\n01:53:14.504 --> 01:53:17.118\nOne, two, three, four, five, six, and\n\n2097\n01:53:17.118 --> 01:53:21.432\ncount all the way over to where our\nfilename started and I could just say,\n\n2098\n01:53:21.432 --> 01:53:24.213\ncut out and\ngive me this character to that one.\n\n2099\n01:53:24.213 --> 01:53:31.330\nYou would say basically cut -c and\nthen you would say, 2-4.\n\n2100\n01:53:31.330 --> 01:53:34.430\nThat would say give me\ncharacters 2 through 4.\n\n2101\n01:53:34.430 --> 01:53:38.145\nSo if we look at ls -la, and\n\n2102\n01:53:38.145 --> 01:53:43.486\nwe pipe that into cut, c, -c2-4.\n\n2103\n01:53:43.486 --> 01:53:47.172\nNow I just get characters 2 through 4,\ncut out character 1 and\n\n2104\n01:53:47.172 --> 01:53:51.810\nthen it gave me 2 through 4, and\nthen cut out 5 through the rest of it.\n\n2105\n01:53:51.810 --> 01:53:55.710\nSo you can use it that way, if you\nhave columns though with a delimiter,\n\n2106\n01:53:55.710 --> 01:53:59.250\nyou can feed off of that, you can\nget really powerful with this stuff.\n\n2107\n01:53:59.250 --> 01:54:03.645\nI'm going to take ls -la,\nI'm gonna pipe that into tr -s,\n\n2108\n01:54:03.645 --> 01:54:06.328\nand squeeze those spaces together.\n\n2109\n01:54:06.328 --> 01:54:11.510\nSo I can use the space as my\ndelimeter between columns.\n\n2110\n01:54:11.510 --> 01:54:17.258\nAnd then I'm gonna send\nthat into cut -d' ',\n\n2111\n01:54:17.258 --> 01:54:21.430\nI'm saying my delimiter is a space.\n\n2112\n01:54:21.430 --> 01:54:24.360\nSo everywhere you see a space,\nthat's the end of one column and\n\n2113\n01:54:24.360 --> 01:54:25.540\nthe start of another column.\n\n2114\n01:54:26.940 --> 01:54:32.573\nAnd then I can tell it, whoops, -f 3,9.\n\n2115\n01:54:32.573 --> 01:54:36.900\nI want fields 3 and 9.\n\n2116\n01:54:36.900 --> 01:54:42.310\nSo look up here at my ls -la output and\n\n2117\n01:54:42.310 --> 01:54:45.660\nwe've got column one,\ncolumn two, column three.\n\n2118\n01:54:45.660 --> 01:54:47.170\nI want the username.\n\n2119\n01:54:47.170 --> 01:54:50.774\nColumn four, column five, column six,\ncolumn seven, column eight, column nine.\n\n2120\n01:54:50.774 --> 01:54:51.590\nI want the filename.\n\n2121\n01:54:52.660 --> 01:54:54.615\nSo give me the username and the filename.\n\n2122\n01:54:55.860 --> 01:54:59.120\nAnd when I run that,\nI get exactly what I wanted.\n\n2123\n01:54:59.120 --> 01:55:00.995\nJust the username and the filename.\n\n2124\n01:55:00.995 --> 01:55:03.773\nIf I don't want the username,\nI just cut out column number three and\n\n2125\n01:55:03.773 --> 01:55:05.836\ngo down to column number nine,\nand I can run that.\n\n2126\n01:55:05.836 --> 01:55:07.670\nAnd now I just get-\n>> Nice.\n\n2127\n01:55:07.670 --> 01:55:09.737\n>> The filenames in a nice vertical-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n2128\n01:55:09.737 --> 01:55:10.898\n>> Alignment.\n\n2129\n01:55:10.898 --> 01:55:11.653\nThat's a lot of work, isn't it?\n\n2130\n01:55:11.653 --> 01:55:12.198\n>> It is.\n\n2131\n01:55:12.198 --> 01:55:18.022\n>> So ls gave it to me in a horizontal\nalignment and it's screen

down to exactly what I wanted.\n\n2134\n01:55:26.309 --> 01:55:29.534\nI had to feed it into\nthe translate command to shrink or\n\n2135\n01:55:29.534 --> 01:55:32.020\nsqueeze those spaces together.\n\n2136\n01:55:32.020 --> 01:55:34.800\nAnd then I had to use cut with a delimiter\n\n2137\n01:55:34.800 --> 01:55:38.488\nto grab particular fields out of\nit to just get the filename field.\n\n2138\n01:55:38.488 --> 01:55:39.399\nSo that's-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n2139\n01:55:39.399 --> 01:55:41.083\n>> An example of how complex we can get\n\n2140\n01:55:41.083 --> 01:55:42.030\nwith this.\n\n2141\n01:55:42.030 --> 01:55:44.530\nBut if you need data in a certain way,\nyou can certainly get it.\n\n2142\n01:55:46.790 --> 01:55:51.953\nThe only other ones just three last\nlittle ones, expand and unexpand.\n\n2143\n01:55:51.953 --> 01:55:53.961\nI really don't use these.\n\n2144\n01:55:53.961 --> 01:55:58.526\nIf you have got a file that\ncontains tabs you can use\n\n2145\n01:55:58.526 --> 01:56:03.098\nthe expand command to\nexpand the tab into spaces.\n\n2146\n01:56:03.098 --> 01:56:07.924\nI guess I could whip up an example but\nreally,\n\n2147\n01:56:07.924 --> 01:56:13.258\nif I say expand and\nthen I say something like well,\n\n2148\n01:56:13.258 --> 01:56:17.579\nit's not gonna echo this to the screen.\n\n2149\n01:56:17.579 --> 01:56:18.720\nWhat would be a good way to do this?\n\n2150\n01:56:18.720 --> 01:56:24.728\nIf I say echo \"This, this is not gonna\nlet me tab from the command line.\n\n2151\n01:56:24.728 --> 01:56:25.691\nWell-\n>> Yeah.\n\n2152\n01:56:25.691 --> 01:56:29.331\n>> Anyhow, if we have a file with tabs\nin it, if you do expand on that file,\n\n2153\n01:56:29.331 --> 01:56:31.969\nit will take every tab and\njust turn it into spaces.\n\n2154\n01:56:31.969 --> 01:56:33.605\nFive spaces instead of one tab.\n\n2155\n01:56:33.605 --> 01:56:34.511\n>> Tabs.\n\n2156\n01:56:34.511 --> 01:56:38.476\n>> Unexpand does the same thing, anytime\nit sees a bunch of spaces in a row,\n\n2157\n01:56:38.476 --> 01:56:40.040\nit converts them into a tab.\n\n2158\n01:56:41.720 --> 01:56:46.295\nSo pretty straight forward there if you\nlook at the unexpand, it will tell you.\n\n2159\n01:56:46.295 --> 01:56:50.659\nYou can modify exactly how many\ntabs does space equals and so on.\n\n2160\n01:56:50.659 --> 01:56:52.332\nI said the default was five.\n\n2161\n01:56:52.332 --> 01:56:55.374\nIt looks like the default is eight.\n\n2162\n01:56:55.374 --> 01:56:56.256\nNo, I'm glad I checked that.\n\n2163\n01:56:56.256 --> 01:56:57.452\n>> Yeah.\n>> So yeah, the default is eight.\n\n2164\n01:56:57.452 --> 01:57:00.440\nBut you can use -t to\nmanipulate that value, so\n\n2165\n01:57:00.440 --> 01:57:02.919\nexpand and unexpand can change those.\n\n2166\n01:57:02.919 --> 01:57:10.985\nFMT, that's another one\nI gotta run this way.\n\n2167\n01:57:10.985 --> 01:57:15.510\nYou see FMT, it's designed to\nreformat the flow of a document.\n\n2168\n01:57:15.510 --> 01:57:19.620\nSo you may have a width,\nthe height like margins on it.\n\n2169\n01:57:19.620 --> 01:57:22.929\nAnd it can go in and\nadjust that changing pagination.\n\n2170\n01:57:22.929 --> 01:57:25.160\nTalks about crown margin and so on.\n\n2171\n01:57:25.160 --> 01:57:28.980\nYou can split it up very similar to PR,\ngetting it ready for print.\n\n2172\n01:57:28.980 --> 01:57:30.960\nExcept PR wants to add little headers and\nstuff.\n\n2173\n01:57:30.960 --> 01:57:32.656\nFMT doesn't,\nwell unless you tell it to do it.\n\n2174\n01:57:32.656 --> 01:57:37.692\nSo FMT is another one that we\ncan use to manipulate our data,\n\n2175\n01:57:37.692 --> 01:57:39.924\nand the last one is split.\n\n2176\n01:57:39.924 --> 01:57:45.000\nSplit we can use to divide up\na file into multiple files.\n\n2177\n01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:51.138\nNow this didn't used to be very useful but\nactually, it can be useful today.\n\n2178\n01:57:51.138 --> 01:57:55.341\nIf you wanna move data between\na Linux box and a Windows box.\n\n2179\n01:57:55.341 --> 01:58:00.339\nWell Linux likes to format\nthings [LAUGH] ext4-\n\n2180\n01:58:00.339 --> 01:58:01.221\n>> Ext.\n\n2181\n01:58:01.221 --> 01:58:02.559\n[LAUGH]\n>> There we go, and\n\n2182\n01:58:02.559 --> 01:58:06.430\nWindows likes to format things NTFS, and\nthey support large files or whatever.\n\n2183\n01:58:06.430 --> 01:58:08.441\nBut if you wanna move between them,\n\n2184\n01:58:08.441 --> 01:58:11.401\nthe only real common stable\nfile system is FAT32.\n\n2185\n01:58:11.401 --> 01:58:16.259\nI guess we have exFAT now, but the FAT32\nfor the longest time was the best one, and\n\n2186\n01:58:16.259 --> 01:58:19.570\nit wouldn't take files\nover 2 gigs in size.\n\n2187\n01:58:19.570 --> 01:58:22.970\nSo if you wanted to move a 5 gig file\nbetween the systems you really couldn't,\n\n2188\n01:58:22.970 --> 01:58:24.410\nnot that way at least.\n\n2189\n01:58:24.410 --> 01:58:30.150\nSo we could use the split command\nto break a file up into pieces.\n\n2190\n01:58:30.150 --> 01:58:33.860\nAnd then on the other side we could\njoin the files back together again and\n\n2191\n01:58:33.860 --> 01:58:35.000\nhave it combined.\n\n2192\n01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:38.960\nI used to use this back in the floppy disk\ndays cuz you might need to break something\n\n2193\n01:58:38.960 --> 01:58:42.710\nup across a bunch of 1.44 megabyte\nfloppy disks and go that way.\n\n2194\n01:58:42.710 --> 01:58:47.591\nSo if I wanna break up a file,\nlike I'll take that VMware Tools.\n\n2195\n01:58:47.591 --> 01:58:51.950\nIt's 61 megs in size,\nmaybe I wanna break it up in 10 meg files.\n\n2196\n01:58:51.950 --> 01:58:57.760\nSo I can just come in here, and\nI can run split -b to tell how many bytes.\n\n2197\n01:58:57.760 --> 01:59:01.889\nI wanna break this up\ninto a 10 megabyte file.\n\n2198\n01:59:01.889 --> 01:59:05.248\nAnd then I need to tell it the file\nthat I'm gonna be breaking up,\n\n2199\n01:59:05.248 --> 01:59:06.941\nwhich is gonna be VMwareTools.\n\n2200\n01:59:06.941 --> 01:59:08.880\nAnd then I need to tell it\nwhat I'm wanna call it.\n\n2201\n01:59:08.880 --> 01:59:11.017\nSo I'll just call it vmtools,\n\n2202\n01:59:11.017 --> 01:59:15.962\nactually you know what I'll just call\nit tools sorta fit on the screen.\n\n2203\n01:59:15.962 --> 01:59:17.770\nNow I'm gonna stop there with a dot.\n\n2204\n01:59:17.770 --> 01:59:20.280\nAnd the reason is,\nwhen it generates these new files,\n\n2205\n01:59:20.280 --> 01:59:24.970\nit's gonna add an extension to the end\nthat tells us what the file order is.\n\n2206\n01:59:24.970 --> 01:59:30.458\nWhen I run that, it's gonna break\nthat file up and now when I look,\n\n2207\n01:59:30.458 --> 01:59:34.968\nsee how I've got tools.aa,\nab, ac, ad, and so on.\n\n2208\n01:59:34.968 --> 01:59:39.272\nAnd when it reaches az,\nthen it goes to ba, bb, bc, and so on.\n\n2209\n01:59:39.272 --> 01:59:42.430\nSo it just broke it up into 10 meg files.\n\n2210\n01:59:44.390 --> 01:59:47.810\nNow we can copy those to our media,\nsend them to the other side, and\n\n2211\n01:59:47.810 --> 01:59:50.500\nat the other side we can just\ncombine them back again.\n\n2212\n01:59:50.500 --> 01:59:53.680\nYou combine them using the cat command and\n\n2213\n01:59:53.680 --> 01:59:56.700\nso catalog, and\njust list what's in a file.\n\n2214\n01:59:56.700 --> 01:59:59.722\nWe basically say, cat tools.??\n\n2215\n01:59:59.722 --> 02:00:03.761\nSo anything called tools dot and\ntwo characters.\n\n2216\n02:00:03.761 --> 02:00:08.905\nAnd then we pipe it's output into\nwhatever we want our new file to be.\n\n2217\n02:00:08.905 --> 02:00:12.395\nSo I'll do it in the tools.tgz.\n\n2218\n02:00:12.395 --> 02:00:14.905\nAnd when we run that,\nit's gonna read into those files.\n\n2219\n02:00:14.905 --> 02:00:18.533\nAnd put them together so when I look,\n\n2220\n02:00:18.533 --> 02:00:24.049\nI now have tools.tgz which\nis the full 61 megabytes.\n\n2221\n02:00:24.049 --> 02:00:26.900\nSee, it's the exact same as\nthe file before I messed with it.\n\n2222\n02:00:26.900 --> 02:00:28.531\nSo we can use split to break it apart.\n\n2223\n02:00:28.531 --> 02:00:29.088\n>> Nice.\n\n2224\n02:00:29.088 --> 02:00:34.233\n>> And then tgz to combine, I mean\na cat to join them back together again.\n\n2225\n02:00:34.233 --> 02:00:38.215\nWell, I think we've-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n2226\n02:00:38.215 --> 02:00:40.103\n>> Probably overwhelmed ourselves with\n\n2227\n02:00:40.103 --> 02:00:40.932\ncommands here.\n\n2228\n02:00:40.932 --> 02:00:42.290\nThere's a ton of them-\n>> Yup.\n\n2229\n02:00:42.290 --> 02:00:45.095\n>> And the more you use them,\nthe more you get used to them,\n\n2230\n02:00:45.095 --> 02:00:47.433\nbut some of them we just\ndon't use very often.\n\n2231\n02:00:47.433 --> 02:00:51.380\nSo be familiar with those,\nthey are useful.\n\n2232\n02:00:51.380 --> 02:00:52.663\nYou've got your man command.\n\n2233\n02:00:52.663 --> 02:00:54.650\nYou can always pull up their\nmanual if you need it.\n\n2234\n02:00:54.650 --> 02:00:56.410\nBut you can manipulate\ntext however you need it.\n\n2235\n02:00:56.410 --> 02:00:57.873\nIt's pretty cool stuff.\n>> Yeah.\n\n2236\n02:00:57.873 --> 02:01:00.508\n>> Well, this is a pretty good spot for\nus to wrap up the show.\n\n2237\n02:01:00.508 --> 02:01:01.355\nWhat do you think, Ronnie?\n\n2238\n02:01:01.355 --> 02:01:02.088\n>> Sounds great.\n\n2239\n02:01:02.088 --> 02:01:05.014\n>> Well, let me

00:00:36.660\nAll right, good morning,\ngood afternoon, and good evening, and\n\n5\n00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.595\nwelcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:38.595 --> 00:00:41.056\nI'm your host, Don Pezet,\ntoday with Mr Ronnie Wong.\n\n7\n00:00:41.056 --> 00:00:41.834\nHow's it going, Ronnie?\n\n8\n00:00:41.834 --> 00:00:42.949\n>> Today I am shocked.\n\n9\n00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:43.871\n>> Shocked.\n\n10\n00:00:43.871 --> 00:00:44.860\n>> Shocked to no end.\n\n11\n00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:45.390\n>> Shocked and awed?\n\n12\n00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:48.150\n>> Yes, shocked and awed.\n\n13\n00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:53.360\nI found out that Daniel Radcliffe is ready\nto play Robin to Ben Affleck's Batman.\n\n14\n00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.764\n>> That is awesome, that is the cast\nthat keeps on getting better.\n\n15\n00:00:56.764 --> 00:00:57.808\n>> It is.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n16\n00:00:57.808 --> 00:00:58.389\n>> Yeah.\n\n17\n00:00:58.389 --> 00:01:00.418\n[LAUGH]\n>> I guess they figured we can't ruin\n\n18\n00:01:00.418 --> 00:01:04.519\nit any more, we'll have Ben Affleck, who's\nas good a Batman as we can get, right?\n\n19\n00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:05.738\n[LAUGH]\n>> Right.\n\n20\n00:01:05.738 --> 00:01:07.085\nMight as well get a Robin to match.\n\n21\n00:01:07.085 --> 00:01:07.782\n>> And Harry Potter.\n\n22\n00:01:07.782 --> 00:01:12.726\n[LAUGH] All right, well,\nwe've got another episode of Linux+ up for\n\n23\n00:01:12.726 --> 00:01:16.647\nus today, and\nwe're gonna be jumping into what LPI and\n\n24\n00:01:16.647 --> 00:01:20.840\nCompTIA call the system\narchitecture section of things.\n\n25\n00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.182\nNow, wait a minute.\n\n26\n00:01:22.182 --> 00:01:23.850\nYou might be saying to yourself, hey, Don,\n\n27\n00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.430\nI'm looking at the exam objectives\nhere and that comes first.\n\n28\n00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.920\nWhy are you guys covering this\nin the very last episode?\n\n29\n00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.200\nAnd let me tell you guys,\n\n30\n00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.110\nit really does come down to what\nmakes logical sense, right.\n\n31\n00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.570\nSo I'm just gonna bring up the exam\nobjectives here on the screen real quick.\n\n32\n00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.128\nI say I'm going to do that, but\nI'm not sharing my desktop, am I?\n\n33\n00:01:42.128 --> 00:01:44.680\nLet me [LAUGH] try that again.\n\n34\n00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.670\nSo anyhow, I'm gonna pull up\nthe exam objectives here and\n\n35\n00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.010\nkind of run through this.\n\n36\n00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:51.700\nBasically when I looked at the objectives,\n\n37\n00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.420\nthey start out with system architecture,\nand it gets into some concepts\n\n38\n00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.540\nthat are fairly hard to understand if\nyou're just starting out with Linux.\n\n39\n00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.500\nAnd so, we made the decision to\njump into Linux installation and\n\n40\n00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.870\nthe commands and the file systems,\nand do all of that\n\n41\n00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:12.220\nfirst because that makes sense to\npeople learning a new operating system.\n\n42\n00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:13.390\nAnd then double back and\n\n43\n00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.920\ncatch the system architecture\npart here at the end, all right?\n\n44\n00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.540\nAnd so that's what we're gonna do now.\n\n45\n00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.430\nIt's a little bit different order than\nwhat's in the exam objectives, but\n\n46\n00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.920\nit makes more logical sense.\n\n47\n00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.680\nAll right, so, for system architecture,\n\n48\n00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.900\nit starts to dive into some\npretty unusual concepts.\n\n49\n00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.410\nIt's really built around\nthe idea of identifying\n\n50\n00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:35.360\nhardware [COUGH] that's\nin use by the system.\n\n51\n00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.020\nAnd how Linux sees the hardware,\nhow it interacts with the hardware and\n\n52\n00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:41.840\nhow it represents it to you.\n\n53\n00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.300\nNow we've already seen that a little\nbit when we worked with hard drives.\n\n54\n00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.995\nWe saw things like /dev/sda1 and\nso on, and\n\n55\n00:02:48.995 --> 00:02:52.804\nthose were file\nrepresentations of hardware.\n\n56\n00:02:52.804 --> 00:02:54.920\nBut you'll see there's a lot more to it.\n\n57\n00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.579\nAnd so that's what we're gonna be taking\na look at as we move through system\n\n58\n00:02:58.579 --> 00:02:59.400\narchitecture.\n\n59\n00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:04.190\nAll right, so let's talk a little bit\nabout that whole /dev folder, all right.\n\n60\n00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:09.890\nIt is a folder on the hard drive, we can\nbrowse to it, just cd/dev and off you go.\n\n61\n00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:15.060\nAnd when you're in there,\nyou see stuff, right, a lot of stuff.\n\n62\n00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.370\nIn fact, let me pull it up here,\n\n63\n00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.990\nso everybody knows I'm not lying,\nthat there is actually stuff in there.\n\n64\n00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:24.390\nSo, when I pull up the list, you'll\nsee there's a bunch of junk in there.\n\n65\n00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.230\nAnd what these are are file\nrepresentations of our hardware.\n\n66\n00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.690\nNow, we were working with\nthe hard drive ones, right?\n\n67\n00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:38.380\nSo, sda for scsi disk a, the first one,\nand scsi disk b, scsi disk c, and so on.\n\n68\n00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:44.560\nAnd you have sda1, sda2, and so on for\nthe partitions inside of those disks.\n\n69\n00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:49.200\nYou've also got ttys, those are for your\nteletypes, your consoles on the system.\n\n70\n00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.940\nYou've got other things in here too.\n\n71\n00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:54.110\nBasically, all of your hardware is\nrepresented one way or another in here.\n\n72\n00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.060\nNow, we talked a little bit about those,\nabout those files that are there.\n\n73\n00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:04.620\nBut there's also some directories that\nare in here that each have a purpose also.\n\n74\n00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:09.890\nSo you'll see like disc,\ncpu, mapper, net and so on.\n\n75\n00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:12.490\nThese are our places that\nwe can browse into and\n\n76\n00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:16.110\nstart to get additional\ninformation about our hardware.\n\n77\n00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:20.270\nSome of these are links, like dvd, dvdrw,\n\n78\n00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:24.800\na lot of those will be links that just\nlink right back to CD-ROM or whatever.\n\n79\n00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.120\nSo you do see some variations, all right.\n\n80\n00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.940\nNow, how did these files get\nhere in the first place?\n\n81\n00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:36.120\nWell, in your Linux distribution,\nunder the hood in the background,\n\n82\n00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:39.940\nthere's a process called udev, U-D-E-V.\n\n83\n00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:44.290\nAnd udev is that back end side\nthat's identifying your hardware and\n\n84\n00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:46.980\ncreating these representations right here.\n\n85\n00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:48.220\nSo udev is responsible for\n\n86\n00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:53.220\nthat, now udev is one of those areas\nthat has really advanced over the years.\n\n87\n00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:57.980\nWhen I first got started with Linux,\nwe had what were called static mappings,\n\n88\n00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:00.430\nLinux didn't actually know\nwhat hardware was there.\n\n89\n00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:02.731\nAnd so\nit would create static mappings here for\n\n90\n00:05:02.731 --> 00:05:05.470\ndevices that you didn't even have,\nall right?\n\n91\n00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:10.300\nSo you might only have one hard drive\nin your system, but it used to be that\n\n92\n00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:14.660\nyou browsed into /dev, and you would see\nhda, hdb, hdc, all the way to hdz, for\n\n93\n00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:17.910\nup to 26 hard drives, and\nyou might only have one, right?\n\n94\n00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:21.190\nIt didn't know, so it just went ahead and\ncreated all the mappings for it, and if\n\n95\n00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:25.320\nyou accessed one of them that correlated\nto a real hard drive, it worked.\n\n96\n00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:28.033\nBut if you accessed one that connected\nto a hard drive that didn't exist,\n\n97\n00:05:28.033 --> 00:05:29.146\nyou'd get an error, right.\n\n98\n00:05:29.146 --> 00:05:31.960\nAnd so it made it where\nwhen you browsed into /dev,\n\n99\n00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:34.560\nit was a massive amount of data in there.\n\n100\n00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.820\nAnd a lot of the hardware wasn't\neven really present, okay?\n\n101\n00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:42.590\nWell now, the hardware is\ndynamically detected by udev, and\n\n102\n00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:44.900\nwhen it finds it,\nit then creates the mapping.\n\n103\n00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:48.580\nSo when we look at this list here, that's\nall the hardware that we really have.\n\n104\n00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:51.540\nThis stuff is hardware\nthat's really present.\n\n105\n00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:53.780\nIf I see sdb, sdc, sdd,\n\n106\n00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:57.860\nI know I've got four drives, right,\nand that they're real drives.\n\n107\n00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:00.830\nIt's not like the other one's\njust a placeholder, so,\n\n108\n00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:03.670\nreally a big change from\nthe older distributions.\n\n109\n00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:06.480\nAnd by older,\nI mean really like eight to ten years ago.\n\n110\n00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:09.410\nSo, it's definitely been\na while that we've had,\n\n111\n00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:13.660\nthe dynamic, hardware identification like\nthis, so really cool stuff, all right.\n\n112\n00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:16.260\nNow, udev doesn't work by itself.\n\n113\n00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.813\nIt actually works in combination\nwith two other things.\n\n114\n00:06:18.813 --> 00:06:23.746\nWe have udev, the hal, H-A-L,\n\n115\n00:06:23.746 --> 00:06:26.880\nand dbus, all right, or the dynamic bus.\n\n116\n00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:31.049\nAnd these three things talk to each other\nand they perform a different function.\n\n117\n00:06:31.049 --> 00:06:34.098\nSo udev identifies the hardware,\nright, and\n\n118\n00:06:34.098 --> 00:06:37.319\nit creates these mappings\nthat we can access it.\n\n119\n00:06:37.319 --> 00:06:40.080\nhal is the hardware abstraction layer, and\n\n120\n00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:44.506\nit allows udev to interact\nwith what's called the dbus.\n\n121\n00:06:44.506 --> 00:06:48.880\ndbus is what actually communicates\nwith the software on our system.\n\n122\n00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:53.870\nSo if you launch a MP3 player, and\nyou hit play to play music, your MP3\n\n123\n00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:59.800\nplayer uses the dbus to talk to the hal,\nand it says hey, I'm trying to play music.\n\n124\n00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:04.950\nAnd the hal then reaches out to\nudev to find the music device,\n\n125\n00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:09.020\nusually /dev/snd, which we'll see in here,\nyeah, right there, snd.\n\n126\n00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:11.730\nSo that's like our generic sound device.\n\n127\n00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:14.520\nAnd so then udev will provide that\nconnection, and then we're off and\n\n128\n00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:15.600\ngoing and playing.\n\n129\n00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:18.571\nSo the three of them serve\na unique purpose, right,\n\n130\n00:07:18.571 --> 00:07:22.110\nthat all three together gives\nus our hardware access.\n\n131\n00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:26.190\nSo let me bring up my notes to show\nyou kind of how I've written that out,\n\n132\n00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:29.280\nis I kinda map it this way.\n\n133\n00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:32.320\nudev talks to hal, and\nit's a two-way communication.\n\n134\n00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:33.650\nThe hal can talk to udev.\n\n135\n00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:37.170\nAnd hal talks to dbus, and\ndbus talks back to the hal.\n\n136\n00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:40.080\nSo dbus is interacting with our software.\n\n137\n00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:42.660\nudev is interacting with\nour physical hardware.\n\n138\n00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:47.444\nAnd the hal is kind of that intermediary,\nthe go-between of the systems, all right.\n\n139\n00:07:47.444 --> 00:07:49.279\nThings weren't always like that.\n\n140\n00:07:49.279 --> 00:07:54.004\nWhen we didn't have like the hal in place,\nit was driver hell.\n\n141\n00:07:54.004 --> 00:07:56.311\nI mean,\nyou had to have specialized drivers for\n\n142\n00:07:56.311 --> 00:07:58.512\nalmost every software\npackage that you ran.\n\n143\n00:07:58.512 --> 00:08:02.402\nNow, we have the HAL,\nthe harbor obstruction layer.\n\n144\n00:08:02.402 --> 00:08:07.470\nAnd so, our software no longer has to know\nhow to talk directly to the hardware.\n\n145\n00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:11.040\nIt just has to know how to talk to\nthe D bus and through it the HAL.\n\n146\n00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:15.480\nAnd then the HAL, can use drivers\nto access the actual hardware.\n\n147\n00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:19.310\nAnd that makes it where the hardware\nvendors just split the HAL, not software.\n\n148\n00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:22.550\nAnd software vendors just have to\nsplit the HAL and not hardware.\n\n149\n00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:24.350\nSo it gives us that separation.\n\n150\n00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:27.010\nBut these three things work together,\nand for\n\n151\n00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:29.670\nthe most part we never\nhave to mess with them.\n\n152\n00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:32.190\nThey do their job and\nthey do it really well.\n\n153\n00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:37.110\nThere are times where you might have to\nreach in there and mess with things, but\n\n154\n00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:41.120\nfor the most part we don't\nreally have to sweat it.\n\n155\n00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:45.100\nOkay now the HAL, the hardware abstraction\nlayer, one of the things that it does\n\n156\n00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:49.290\nIs it creates a XML\nrepresentation of the hardware.\n\n157\n00:08:49.290 --> 00:08:53.900\nSo when udev is mapping things out,\nit's not just mapping and saying,\n\n158\n00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:57.960\nhey the sound card is tied to /dev/snd,\nit's not stopping there, right?\n\n159\n00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:02.980\nIt's going on to provide a lot\nmore information as far as like,\n\n160\n00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:06.800\nwhat registers, what memory registers that\nsystem's using, what DMAs they're tied to,\n\n161\n00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:10.070\nall that other kind of crazy stuff,\nand we just don't see that, right?\n\n162\n00:09:10.070 --> 00:09:11.040\nWell, the HAL does.\n\n163\n00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:14.160\nAnd I'll show you some commands here in\na little bit that'll show you how we can\n\n164\n00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:17.780\nstart to see some of that information,\nthat we've kind of manipulated or\n\n165\n00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:19.410\nat least look at it to find out things.\n\n166\n00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:22.120\nAll right.\n\n167\n00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:27.610\nNow, let's say that we have a device,\na hard drive or whatever that we hook up,\n\n168\n00:09:27.610 --> 00:09:32.330\nand udev identifies it and\nattaches a code here to it, right?\n\n169\n00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:37.110\nAnd we don't like that code, and for\nsome reason we need to change it.\n\n170\n00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:40.520\nMaybe I've got some software\nthat just demands I\n\n171\n00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:45.310\nhave /devl/hda instead of /sda, okay.\n\n172\n00:09:45.310 --> 00:09:48.350\nYou can override the udelv mappings.\n\n173\n00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:53.240\nNow in real life land it's something\nyou really rarely have to do.\n\n174\n00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:56.599\nAn example might be, I'm trying to think\nof a real world one that I've done.\n\n175\n00:09:59.070 --> 00:09:59.880\nI know one, Ronnie.\n\n176\n00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:03.840\nRonnie and I both,\nwe work with Cisco equipment a lot.\n\n177\n00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:06.175\nAnd we use those little USB\nserial adapters, right?\n\n178\n00:10:06.175 --> 00:10:07.480\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n179\n00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:09.990\nMost laptops these days\ndon't have serial ports.\n\n180\n00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:11.690\nDo I have mine?\n\n181\n00:10:11.690 --> 00:10:13.770\nI don't have mine.\n\n182\n00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:15.950\nAnyhow, most laptops don't\nhave serial ports, but\n\n183\n00:10:15.950 --> 00:10:18.750\nto connect to this console equipment,\nwe need a serial port.\n\n184\n00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:21.490\nWe buy these little usb\nto serial adapters and\n\n185\n00:10:21.490 --> 00:10:25.570\nyou stick them on your laptop and\nyour laptop picks them up as a usb device.\n\n186\n00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:30.590\nAnd then if your Linux system\nrecognizes it might map it and\n\n187\n00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:32.150\nmap it as a USB device.\n\n188\n00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:33.930\nBut you need it as a serial port.\n\n189\n00:10:33.930 --> 00:10:38.030\nYou want it to be a serial port that\nyou can communicate with basically,\n\n190\n00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:38.980\na TTY in your system.\n\n191\n00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:41.900\nAnd so it might not map those properly.\n\n192\n00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:45.520\nNow the one I own wouldn't be a good\nexample cuz the one I have works.\n\n193\n00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:48.090\nBut if you have one that just\ndoesn't get recognized properly,\n\n194\n00:10:48.090 --> 00:10:50.250\nyou might need to override it.\n\n195\n00:10:50.250 --> 00:10:53.250\nWell, udev when you plug in devices\n\n196\n00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:57.050\nhas a series of rules that it\nuses to map things together.\n\n197\n00:10:57.050 --> 00:10:59.720\nAnd you can see those,\nthey're in your etc folder.\n\n198\n00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:06.384\nIf I got into /etc/udev.\n\n199\n00:11:08.884 --> 00:11:12.373\nAll right,\nin here you'll see a couple of things and\n\n200\n00:11:12.373 --> 00:11:16.510\nthe one I'm looking for\nis that folder right there rules.d.\n\n201\n00:11:16.510 --> 00:11:17.051\nAll right.\n\n202\n00:11:17.051 --> 00:11:18.328\nIt's a folder and\n\n203\n00:11:18.328 --> 00:11:24.384\ninside of it you'll see the configuration\nfiles that identify how we name devices.\n\n204\n00:11:24.384 --> 00:11:25.250\nOkay.\n\n205\n00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:31.910\nYou'll see some of these in here that\nare for PCMCIA or pc cards for laptops.\n\n206\n00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:35.320\nWe've got CD for our CD drives.\n\n207\n00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:38.820\nNet persistent net rules for\nour network adapters.\n\n208\n00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:42.190\nYou've got kernel and\nrules right over there.\n\n209\n00:11:42.190 --> 00:11:46.434\nI've got VMware installed so\nsee how I've VMware scuzzy dev rules.\n\n210\n00:11:46.434 --> 00:11:49.460\nThose are so\nthat my SCSI hard drives that I attach\n\n211\n00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:53.020\nwill show up as SDA instead\nof some kind of virtual disk.\n\n212\n00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:55.600\nAlsa rules, those are for the sound cards.\n\n213\n00:11:55.600 --> 00:12:00.970\nAnd so each of these are for basically\nsetting how we name those devices.\n\n214\n00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:05.290\nAnd you can do overrides, right.\n\n215\n00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:07.540\nAnother maybe real world\nexample we might have.\n\n216\n00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:10.850\nMaybe at two network\nadapters in your computer.\n\n217\n00:12:10.850 --> 00:12:14.520\nRight, one was identified as eth0,\nor ethernet 0, and\n\n218\n00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:17.530\nthe other one was\nidentified as ethernet 1.\n\n219\n00:12:17.530 --> 00:12:21.150\nRight, so F0, F1, those are the two\nadapters that were on your system.\n\n220\n00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:23.300\nAnd then over time you\ndecide you don't need one.\n\n221\n00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:27.290\nAnd so you pull one out, and\nthe one you pull out was ETH0.\n\n222\n00:12:27.290 --> 00:12:30.990\nWell the one that you're\nleft with is ETH1.\n\n223\n00:12:30.990 --> 00:12:34.410\nWell you decide, I don't want that\nto be ETH1, I want that to be ETH0.\n\n224\n00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:37.780\nWell you can temporarily\noverride the name,\n\n225\n00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:39.440\nbut there's not a lot of point in that.\n\n226\n00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:41.770\nInstead you can come and\nmodify these persistent rules.\n\n227\n00:12:41.770 --> 00:12:45.600\nPersistent means that it will\nstay even after a reboot.\n\n228\n00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:48.330\nSo this way we can map a network\nadapter or whatever, and\n\n229\n00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:50.970\nsay this is the name\nthat you're gonna use.\n\n230\n00:12:50.970 --> 00:12:57.580\nIf I were to edit that file, so I'm just\ngonna edit the persistent-net-rules file\n\n231\n00:12:58.895 --> 00:13:02.645\nwhen you go in there,\nyou'll see your adapters listed and\n\n232\n00:13:02.645 --> 00:13:05.545\nthis is the network file, so\nI'm gonna see my network adapters.\n\n233\n00:13:05.545 --> 00:13:09.175\nI've got an adapter right here,\nit shows the MAC address of it.\n\n234\n00:13:10.365 --> 00:13:12.560\nThat's the easiest way to\nidentify which one it is.\n\n235\n00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:16.300\nAnd then over here I can see that\nit's gonna be named eth something and\n\n236\n00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:18.870\nthen this one's gonna be named eth0.\n\n237\n00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:23.300\nRight, if I wanna force\nthis one to be eth1, I can.\n\n238\n00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:25.800\nOr if it was already one and\nI wanna make it zero, I can.\n\n239\n00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:29.610\nI would just need to make sure I didn't\nhave another adapter named zero.\n\n240\n00:13:29.610 --> 00:13:33.470\nIf I make the change here and save it\nwhen I reboot, the change will stay.\n\n241\n00:13:33.470 --> 00:13:37.970\nAnd that's the important part,\nis that you don't want to make, well,\n\n242\n00:13:37.970 --> 00:13:39.820\nmaybe you do wanna make a temporary\nchange, but normally you don't.\n\n243\n00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:41.740\nNormally, you want that\nchange to be permanent, so\n\n244\n00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:44.050\nthese persistent files are what does it.\n\n245\n00:13:44.050 --> 00:13:46.812\nIf I took a look at the CD rules,\n\n246\n00:13:46.812 --> 00:13:52.060\nall right,\n\n247\n00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:57.330\nyou'll see in here the various things that\nare mapped to CDROM, CDRW, DVD, DVDRW.\n\n248\n00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:02.950\nAnd as you look at this one,\nit looks a little bit confusing, but\n\n249\n00:14:02.950 --> 00:14:10.030\nnotice how it's got my VMware_IDE CDROM\ndrive, and look at the PCI ID.\n\n250\n00:14:10.030 --> 00:14:16.330\nThe PCI, so on my PCI bus,\nthe ID is all zeros, all zeros, 7.1.\n\n251\n00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:20.717\nAnd as I look down the list here,\n7.1, 7.1, 7.1.\n\n252\n00:14:20.717 --> 00:14:21.966\nThis is all the same drive.\n\n253\n00:14:21.966 --> 00:14:27.620\nThis is the same drive being\nmapped to cdrom, cdrw, dvd, dvdrw.\n\n254\n00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:31.120\nSo when the system wants to play a DVD\nit knows that this is a DVD drive.\n\n255\n00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:34.700\nWhen it wants to read a CD,\nit knows it's a CD drive also.\n\n256\n00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:36.430\nAnd if wants to do a burn it can.\n\n257\n00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:38.670\nIt recognizes all of those roles.\n\n258\n00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:42.440\nSo you can have one device\nmapped to more than one name.\n\n259\n00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:44.710\nSo you can add those\nadditional ones there.\n\n260\n00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:48.190\nI could take that network adapter,\nand I could make it F0, and F1.\n\n261\n00:14:48.190 --> 00:14:52.420\nIt's not gonna be happy about that,\nhaving the same IP on two interfaces, but\n\n262\n00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:54.470\nyou can do that.\n\n263\n00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:56.650\nSo there, there's times where\nyou might want it like this,\n\n264\n00:14:56.650 --> 00:14:59.270\nand there's other times where\nit might not be appropriate.\n\n265\n00:14:59.270 --> 00:15:02.010\nBut yeah, these are the rules,\nthat udev uses.\n\n266\n00:15:02.010 --> 00:15:05.060\nNow, If we don't put these rules\nin here udev makes its own.\n\n267\n00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:06.210\nIt's got it's default rules.\n\n268\n00:15:06.210 --> 00:15:11.300\nHey, if I see some adaptors, some network\nadaptors I'm gonna name them f zero,\n\n269\n00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:16.540\nf one, f two, f three and so on based\non the order that I find them, right?\n\n270\n00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:21.720\nBut we can go in here and modify these and\nnow we've overwritten new devs behavior.\n\n271\n00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:28.380\nThere are times where\nyou may need to do that.\n\n272\n00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:31.190\nAnd my system might be\ndifferent than yours, so\n\n273\n00:15:31.190 --> 00:15:33.860\nyou might even see more files\nin here than what I've got.\n\n274\n00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:36.552\nThese are just the ones\nthat pertain to my system.\n\n275\n00:15:38.425 --> 00:15:40.370\nAnd it's fun to poke\nthrough some of these.\n\n276\n00:15:40.370 --> 00:15:42.730\nI guess that depends\non how you define fun.\n\n277\n00:15:42.730 --> 00:15:45.640\nBut some of them don't have\na whole heck of a lot in them.\n\n278\n00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:46.149\nHere for\n\n279\n00:15:46.149 --> 00:15:50.883\nthe HAL daemon you can see it's really\njust pulling in the udev event itself.\n\n280\n00:15:50.883 --> 00:15:52.822\nSo not a whole lot to be found.\n\n281\n00:15:52.822 --> 00:15:54.990\nBut the net ones,\nthe soundcard one, those guys,\n\n282\n00:15:54.990 --> 00:15:57.118\nthey usually have some\ngood information in them.\n\n283\n00:15:59.719 --> 00:16:00.903\nAll right, so I'll see.\n\n284\n00:16:00.903 --> 00:16:02.881\nAll right, so let's see,\nwhat other damage can we do in here?\n\n285\n00:16:02.881 --> 00:16:06.000\nI think that's about it,\nI do have a note to mention,\n\n286\n00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.642\nwhen you make a change to these rules,\nyou need to reboot.\n\n287\n00:16:08.642 --> 00:16:12.670\nAll right, It's a reboot that triggers\nin that hardware name change,\n\n288\n00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:14.930\nthere's some things that you can\nget away with, without a reboot.\n\n289\n00:16:14.930 --> 00:16:17.897\nThis is one of those that you\ndon't want to mess with that,\n\n290\n00:16:17.897 --> 00:16:19.896\nyou want to go ahead and do the reboot.\n\n291\n00:16:19.896 --> 00:16:24.612\nAll right, few other things,\nhaving your hardware be recognized,\n\n292\n00:16:24.612 --> 00:16:29.820\nis really just the first challenge\nin getting it working, all right.\n\n293\n00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:33.400\nJust because the system\nrecognizes the hardware is there,\n\n294\n00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:37.730\ndoesn't mean that it actually works,\nall right.\n\n295\n00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:41.300\nThe Linux kernel itself, is an interesting\nthing and actually, you know what,\n\n296\n00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:42.960\nI'm going to deviate a bit\nfrom the objectives here.\n\n297\n00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:45.360\nBecause I want to make sure this\nis a concept we understand.\n\n298\n00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:48.490\nWhen somebody decides to\nwrite their own kernel.\n\n299\n00:16:48.490 --> 00:16:51.920\nSo, let's say you decide right now,\nI want to make my own operating system.\n\n300\n00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:56.010\nI don't like these OS' that are out there,\nI want to make my own operating system.\n\n301\n00:16:56.010 --> 00:16:58.390\nWell the kernel is where you start,\nthat's that first piece,\n\n302\n00:16:58.390 --> 00:17:00.810\nthat's the heart of your operating system.\n\n303\n00:17:00.810 --> 00:17:04.190\nAnd there's a decision you\nhave to make on day one.\n\n304\n00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:08.970\nYou have to decide,\ndo I want to create a monolithic kernel or\n\n305\n00:17:08.970 --> 00:17:10.710\na modular kernel, all right.\n\n306\n00:17:10.710 --> 00:17:13.340\nThese are the two types of\nkernels that are out there.\n\n307\n00:17:13.340 --> 00:17:18.130\nA monolithic kernel is,\na kernel where all of\n\n308\n00:17:18.130 --> 00:17:23.320\nthe hardware access information that's\nnecessary, is a part of the kernel itself.\n\n309\n00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:28.070\nAnd the kernel is one big file and\neverything that it needs is in there.\n\n310\n00:17:28.070 --> 00:17:30.700\nIn other words, if you're going\nto be accessing a sound card,\n\n311\n00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:34.780\nthen all the information for interacting\nwith that sound card is in your kernel.\n\n312\n00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:38.090\nAll right, if you're gonna be accessing\na hard drive, all the information for\n\n313\n00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:41.450\naccessing a hard drive is in the kernel,\nall right.\n\n314\n00:17:41.450 --> 00:17:46.140\nNow, monolithic Kernels are very fast and\nare very efficient.\n\n315\n00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:47.560\nBecause all the information for\n\n316\n00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:50.530\ninteracting with the hardware\nis right there in the kernel.\n\n317\n00:17:50.530 --> 00:17:53.240\nThe problem is,\nthey're not very flexible, right.\n\n318\n00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:55.910\nHow many different types of\nsound cards are out there?\n\n319\n00:17:55.910 --> 00:17:56.640\n>> Lots.\n>> Let's find out.\n\n320\n00:17:56.640 --> 00:18:01.250\nSo, I can't remember the last time I\nbought a sound card because most of us,\n\n321\n00:18:01.250 --> 00:18:04.910\nlet's do video cards instead and\nmaybe not CDW.\n\n322\n00:18:04.910 --> 00:18:08.620\nLet's do Newegg, so sound cards now,\n\n323\n00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:12.970\npeople just get them integrated but\nyou know, maybe I'll stick with that.\n\n324\n00:18:12.970 --> 00:18:16.330\nI'm going to keep with the sound card\nthing, so I want to go in here and\n\n325\n00:18:16.330 --> 00:18:18.590\nI want to find some components, right.\n\n326\n00:18:18.590 --> 00:18:19.910\nWhere, computer hardware.\n\n327\n00:18:19.910 --> 00:18:24.230\nAnd maybe I should have picked a site-\n>> Is that another flag above there?\n\n328\n00:18:24.230 --> 00:18:25.710\nYep, right above where you are.\n\n329\n00:18:25.710 --> 00:18:27.290\nThat's it, speakers and sound cards.\n\n330\n00:18:27.290 --> 00:18:30.220\n>> Alright, so let's see how many\nsound cards we can buy today.\n\n331\n00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:34.370\nSo on Newegg and granted some of these\nare going to share the same drivers, but\n\n332\n00:18:34.370 --> 00:18:36.210\nthey have 205 different sound cards, okay.\n\n333\n00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:42.460\nNow, let's assume that a decent portion\nof those share the same driver, so\n\n334\n00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:44.840\nlet's say,\nthat there's really just 25 variations.\n\n335\n00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:46.720\nI'm just making this number up, okay.\n\n336\n00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:48.630\nLet's say there's 25 different variations.\n\n337\n00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:52.440\nWell that means that I've got 25\ndifferent sound card drivers, all right.\n\n338\n00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:56.910\nAnd so, if I'm gonna create a monolithic\nkernel, I've got to have the information.\n\n339\n00:18:56.910 --> 00:19:01.010\nFor communicating with all 25 different\nmodels, built into my kernel.\n\n340\n00:19:01.010 --> 00:19:03.148\nAnd so,\nwhat's going to happen to that kernel?\n\n341\n00:19:03.148 --> 00:19:07.410\nIt's going to grow and grow and grow,\nuntil it gets to be a rather large thing.\n\n342\n00:19:07.410 --> 00:19:09.322\nAnd it starts to become unmanageable,\n\n343\n00:19:09.322 --> 00:19:12.070\ntracking for for bugs,\npreventing segment faults.\n\n344\n00:19:12.070 --> 00:19:16.920\nThat kind of stuff becomes\nreally challenging, so\n\n345\n00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:18.030\nbefore I get ahead of myself.\n\n346\n00:19:18.030 --> 00:19:21.870\nSo Linux is a monolithic kernel,\nso let me just mention that, so\n\n347\n00:19:21.870 --> 00:19:23.520\nit is a monolithic kernel.\n\n348\n00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:27.140\nIn the early days, I mentioned the first\nversion of Linux that I installed was\n\n349\n00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:30.100\nSlackware and\nI did it in it would have been 1994, 95.\n\n350\n00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:33.940\nSo it was Slackware 1.1,\nsomething very early and\n\n351\n00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:36.550\nback then, when you did the install.\n\n352\n00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:40.310\nYou would start\nthe installation process and\n\n353\n00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:42.990\nyou would go into a kernel\ncustomization screen.\n\n354\n00:19:42.990 --> 00:19:47.990\nAnd you would pick your hardware and\nit would compile your kernel right then.\n\n355\n00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:52.010\nIt would build the kernel for\nyour machine as part of the install, or\n\n356\n00:19:52.010 --> 00:19:54.010\nyou can do it yourself later on.\n\n357\n00:19:54.010 --> 00:19:57.930\nYou could remove hardware and add\nhardware to customize it to your system.\n\n358\n00:19:57.930 --> 00:20:02.710\nIn the early days, we built customized\nkernels that were specific to our systems.\n\n359\n00:20:02.710 --> 00:20:05.550\nAnd they were fast, and\nthey were efficient, but\n\n360\n00:20:05.550 --> 00:20:09.500\ntrying to explain to your mom how to,\nhow to compile a kernel.\n\n361\n00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:12.370\nIt's not something the average\nuser could do and so,\n\n362\n00:20:12.370 --> 00:20:16.082\nit's not something we generally\nwant to get involved in.\n\n363\n00:20:16.082 --> 00:20:20.250\nYou have other vendors, Like Microsoft,\nthat did a modular kernel.\n\n364\n00:20:20.250 --> 00:20:23.010\nAnd with their modular kernel,\nwhat they said we've got the kernel,\n\n365\n00:20:23.010 --> 00:20:24.750\nit does this, right.\n\n366\n00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:28.710\nBut then, for all the hardware\nit reaches outside to modules\n\n367\n00:20:28.710 --> 00:20:32.630\nto be able to load in drivers and\nself worth.\n\n368\n00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:36.620\nAs we need them, right, instead of having\nthem all fired up at once, all right.\n\n369\n00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:39.890\nWell, that's how Linux is today, so\n\n370\n00:20:39.890 --> 00:20:43.700\nthe Linux kernel today, while it\nmight have started out as modular.\n\n371\n00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:48.110\nI mean, started out as monolithic,\nit is technically still monolithic under\n\n372\n00:20:48.110 --> 00:20:52.480\nthe hood but\nit has a modular piece attached to it.\n\n373\n00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:55.570\nIt works with kernel modules or kmods.\n\n374\n00:20:55.570 --> 00:20:59.030\nAnd so now,\nwe can provide it the hardware functions,\n\n375\n00:20:59.030 --> 00:21:00.970\nthe ability to talk to our hardware.\n\n376\n00:21:00.970 --> 00:21:05.590\nAnd it loads them dynamically, as needed,\nit really is the best of both worlds.\n\n377\n00:21:05.590 --> 00:21:08.210\nSo, we get a lot of the advantages\nof a monolithic kernel and\n\n378\n00:21:08.210 --> 00:21:10.168\nwe get the advantages of\na modular kernel too.\n\n379\n00:21:10.168 --> 00:21:14.900\nAll kind of rolled into one,\nso UDEF had to change.\n\n380\n00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:18.870\nOther systems inside of Linux had to\nchange, to be able to adapt to that.\n\n381\n00:21:18.870 --> 00:21:22.740\nAnd so now, we end up with a system\nthat can work with modules.\n\n382\n00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:26.730\nAnd it's really, really sweet, becuase\nif you have no SCSI hard drives in your\n\n383\n00:21:26.730 --> 00:21:29.630\nsystem, why would you\nload the SCSI modules?\n\n384\n00:21:29.630 --> 00:21:31.406\nWhy would you load that SCSI information?\n\n385\n00:21:31.406 --> 00:21:34.690\nYou're not going to use it,\nit was wasted space, wasted memory and\n\n386\n00:21:34.690 --> 00:21:37.820\nif you knew enough to compile it out,\nthen you were fine.\n\n387\n00:21:37.820 --> 00:21:41.610\nBut if you didn't know,\nthen you were running sub-optimally.\n\n388\n00:21:41.610 --> 00:21:45.010\nVersions of Linux made in the last ten\nyears haven't had that problem, right.\n\n389\n00:21:45.010 --> 00:21:47.020\nThis is not a new thing,\nthis has been around a while.\n\n390\n00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:51.780\nSo now, when we fire up,\nit's actually detecting your hardware and\n\n391\n00:21:51.780 --> 00:21:54.530\nloading the appropriate modules,\nassuming that it has them.\n\n392\n00:21:54.530 --> 00:21:57.899\nRight, if you have specialized hardware,\nlike a Wacom tablet or\n\n393\n00:21:57.899 --> 00:22:01.550\nsomething like that, well,\nit will come with a Linux driver.\n\n394\n00:22:01.550 --> 00:22:05.620\nAnd effectively that driver\nis just a kernel mod,\n\n395\n00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:08.830\nit's a module that we\ncan add onto our kernel.\n\n396\n00:22:08.830 --> 00:22:11.290\nTo give it the functionality\nto talk to that hardware and\n\n397\n00:22:11.290 --> 00:22:13.350\nit's usually packaged as\njust another software too.\n\n398\n00:22:13.350 --> 00:22:17.330\nBut that hardware module\nis what we really need, so\n\n399\n00:22:17.330 --> 00:22:19.720\nyour operating system's\nalready doing that, right.\n\n400\n00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:24.090\nI've got a Intel e1000 network\nadaptor in this virtual machine and\n\n401\n00:22:24.090 --> 00:22:27.150\nI didn't load a driver for\nit, it already had it.\n\n402\n00:22:27.150 --> 00:22:31.870\nAnd that's because, the Intel e1000\nis a really, really popular adaptor.\n\n403\n00:22:31.870 --> 00:22:36.510\nAnd so, an open source driver was created\nfor it and it was loaded with the system.\n\n404\n00:22:36.510 --> 00:22:40.490\nSo that's a key thing to remember\nright there, an open source driver,\n\n405\n00:22:40.490 --> 00:22:43.420\nnot everybody releases\nopen source drivers.\n\n406\n00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:45.300\nThere are some vendors like Intel,\n\n407\n00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:49.300\nthat absolutely refuse to open\nsource their wireless drivers.\n\n408\n00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:51.480\nAnd so, if you want to have support for\n\n409\n00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:55.970\nyour wireless adaptor, you have to\nget their closed source drivers.\n\n410\n00:22:55.970 --> 00:22:59.380\nNow, some of them have taken\ntheir closed source drivers,\n\n411\n00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:01.080\nones they won't share the code with you.\n\n412\n00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:06.460\nAnd they've released it under a

license.\n\n415\n00:23:12.910 --> 00:23:13.940\n>> Yeah.\n>> One of the,\n\n416\n00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:16.660\nyou know we don't want to go crazy about\nlicensing but it's one of the licenses.\n\n417\n00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:18.560\nThat allows them to\ndistribute the code for\n\n418\n00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:21.220\nfree but\nyou're not allowed to modify it, right.\n\n419\n00:23:21.220 --> 00:23:24.370\nVersus something like the GPL\n,where you distribute it for\n\n420\n00:23:24.370 --> 00:23:26.820\nfree, you can modify it if you want.\n\n421\n00:23:26.820 --> 00:23:27.710\nBut, if you do something better,\n\n422\n00:23:27.710 --> 00:23:29.650\nyou have to send it back to us so\nwe can improve ours too.\n\n423\n00:23:29.650 --> 00:23:31.600\nRight, that's kind of how the GPL works.\n\n424\n00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:33.370\nBut Intel with their wireless drivers,\n\n425\n00:23:33.370 --> 00:23:35.410\nthey released them saying\nyou can use these for free.\n\n426\n00:23:35.410 --> 00:23:36.330\nYou can redistribute them.\n\n427\n00:23:36.330 --> 00:23:38.370\nBut you can't modify them.\n\n428\n00:23:38.370 --> 00:23:41.430\nSo with a closed source driver like that,\nmost of us don't care.\n\n429\n00:23:41.430 --> 00:23:42.840\nMost of us are like, fine.\n\n430\n00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:43.800\nThrow Linus on here.\n\n431\n00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:45.700\nIt has the driver,\nI'll use it, great, done.\n\n432\n00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:50.300\nBut there are some operating systems\nout there where they've taken a hard\n\n433\n00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:51.160\nline on that.\n\n434\n00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:54.540\nAnd they said, we're not going to package\nclosed source drivers with our systems.\n\n435\n00:23:54.540 --> 00:23:58.512\nWe want it to be true open source,\nOpenBSD is an example of that.\n\n436\n00:23:58.512 --> 00:24:01.413\nAnd that's why OpenBSD's\nhard ware support is so\n\n437\n00:24:01.413 --> 00:24:04.875\nlimited because they refuse\nto use closed source drivers.\n\n438\n00:24:04.875 --> 00:24:07.100\nAnd they do it for a good reason.\n\n439\n00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:08.478\nThey wanna do security audits.\n\n440\n00:24:08.478 --> 00:24:13.080\nYou can't do a security audit on\nclosed source software, right?\n\n441\n00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:14.570\nSo it makes sense.\n\n442\n00:24:14.570 --> 00:24:17.410\nFor your average end user, though,\nit's more of an inconvenience.\n\n443\n00:24:17.410 --> 00:24:20.190\nAnd so you'll see distributions\nlike Red Hat that have\n\n444\n00:24:20.190 --> 00:24:23.460\ntons of closed source software\npackaged in them, all right?\n\n445\n00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:26.509\nBut if you're running one of\nthe more puritan versions of Linux,\n\n446\n00:24:26.509 --> 00:24:29.406\nthen you may have to go out and\ndownload the drivers yourself.\n\n447\n00:24:29.406 --> 00:24:32.060\nAnd you go to Intel or\nwherever, and you get them.\n\n448\n00:24:32.060 --> 00:24:33.990\nAnd when you install those packages,\n\n449\n00:24:33.990 --> 00:24:37.650\nwhat it's doing is just adding\nthose kernel modules, all right?\n\n450\n00:24:37.650 --> 00:24:41.540\nSo you may already have it built\ninto your system, you may not.\n\n451\n00:24:41.540 --> 00:24:44.138\nEasiest way to tell is to install your\nhardware and see if it works, right?\n\n452\n00:24:44.138 --> 00:24:46.660\nAnd if it doesn't work, then you\nprobably need to go and get a driver.\n\n453\n00:24:46.660 --> 00:24:50.560\nSo you get that driver from the vendor,\nand you install it, all right?\n\n454\n00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:52.992\nIn Linux, we have a simple command, lsmod,\n\n455\n00:24:52.992 --> 00:24:56.268\nthat will list all the modules\nloaded on our system, right?\n\n456\n00:24:56.268 --> 00:25:00.130\nLet me show you,\nit's a really simple command.\n\n457\n00:25:00.130 --> 00:25:03.526\nWe just run lsmod, and\nI'm gonna pipe it into the more command.\n\n458\n00:25:05.558 --> 00:25:09.850\nAnd it's gonna give me that output and\nshow me all the information that's there.\n\n459\n00:25:10.970 --> 00:25:12.805\nIt can be a little detailed.\n\n460\n00:25:12.805 --> 00:25:13.960\n[LAUGH] But\n\n461\n00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:19.500\nwhat we're seeing, if you look here on\nthe left side, these are the module names.\n\n462\n00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:20.360\nAnd then, on the right side,\n\n463\n00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:24.990\nI can see the size of the module and\nwhat it's in use by, okay?\n\n464\n00:25:24.990 --> 00:25:29.650\nAnd so if you see a 0, that's a module\nthat is not being used, all right?\n\n465\n00:25:29.650 --> 00:25:30.640\nIt's not being used, and so\n\n466\n00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:33.240\nwhile the system has it,\nit's not loaded in the memory.\n\n467\n00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:35.010\nIt's not actually using it right now.\n\n468\n00:25:35.010 --> 00:25:37.420\nSo we don't have to worry about\nthe inefficiencies of before.\n\n469\n00:25:37.420 --> 00:25:39.740\nIt's tracking whether it's being used or\nnot.\n\n470\n00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:42.695\nAnd you'll see some modules,\nlike ipv6 right here,\n\n471\n00:25:42.695 --> 00:25:45.338\nthat's being used by 155 different pieces.\n\n472\n00:25:45.338 --> 00:25:47.550\nAnd it starts to list them over here.\n\n473\n00:25:47.550 --> 00:25:50.120\nThat's obviously a very\nimportant module to us.\n\n474\n00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:53.668\nThere's other ones that may only\nbe used by one other system.\n\n475\n00:25:53.668 --> 00:25:57.920\nLike ip_tables here,\nthat's my IP version 4 firewall filter.\n\n476\n00:25:57.920 --> 00:26:01.290\nIt's being used by one module,\nwhich is probably the IPv4 module.\n\n477\n00:26:01.290 --> 00:26:04.220\nWhich I didn't see,\nit's in here somewhere.\n\n478\n00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:06.888\nIt's not alphabetized, that would\nbe crazy, to alphabetize something.\n\n479\n00:26:06.888 --> 00:26:07.580\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But [LAUGH] but\n\n480\n00:26:07.580 --> 00:26:11.840\nas we look down the list, these\nare all modules that we've got loaded.\n\n481\n00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:16.888\nAnd somewhere in here, well,\nthere's the e1000 one I was talking about.\n\n482\n00:26:16.888 --> 00:26:19.190\nAnd you'll see the sound card adapter.\n\n483\n00:26:19.190 --> 00:26:21.640\nI've got a ac97-based adapter.\n\n484\n00:26:22.950 --> 00:26:24.510\nSomewhere in here, we'll see VMware.\n\n485\n00:26:24.510 --> 00:26:27.170\nCuz I did have to load VMware modules,\nright?\n\n486\n00:26:27.170 --> 00:26:30.200\nSo because I'm running in a virtual\nmachine, and I wanted my OS to be happy,\n\n487\n00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:33.050\nI had to load some extra modules for that.\n\n488\n00:26:33.050 --> 00:26:37.230\nAnd maybe I glanced over them,\nI did not see them.\n\n489\n00:26:37.230 --> 00:26:40.860\nOr they might be representing\nthemselves as traditional hardware.\n\n490\n00:26:40.860 --> 00:26:46.170\nSo when you run desktop virtualization\nlike this, a lot of times it's\n\n491\n00:26:46.170 --> 00:26:50.420\ndoing what's called a type-1 hypervisor,\nwhere it's emulating other hardware.\n\n492\n00:26:50.420 --> 00:26:52.960\nAs opposed to a type-2 hypervisor,\nwhere it sees the real hardware.\n\n493\n00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:57.765\nSo either way,\nI'm not seeing my VMware modules.\n\n494\n00:26:57.765 --> 00:27:01.720\nBut yeah, so just lsmod, it'll show you\nthe modules that are on the system.\n\n495\n00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:04.123\nAnd you can see whether they're\nactually been used or not.\n\n496\n00:27:04.123 --> 00:27:07.350\nIf there's a module with a 0, it's\nprobably not being used by your system.\n\n497\n00:27:07.350 --> 00:27:08.930\nIt's probably not being loaded.\n\n498\n00:27:08.930 --> 00:27:12.877\nThere is one scenario where it might be\nloaded, even though it says a 0 here, but\n\n499\n00:27:12.877 --> 00:27:14.282\nit's not that very common.\n\n500\n00:27:14.282 --> 00:27:17.610\nAll right, so [COUGH] so\nthat's basically it.\n\n501\n00:27:17.610 --> 00:27:19.020\nThat's what we're seeing here.\n\n502\n00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:20.630\nThese are the modules that are in place.\n\n503\n00:27:20.630 --> 00:27:23.270\nIf we wanna install our own,\nit's usually a matter of just\n\n504\n00:27:23.270 --> 00:27:26.360\ndownloading the package from\nthe vendor and installing it.\n\n505\n00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:29.507\nUsing yum or RPM, dpkg or\n\n506\n00:27:29.507 --> 00:27:34.220\napt-get, or whatever to get that and\ninstall it on our system.\n\n507\n00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:39.192\nAll right, well, I got a lot more\nto talk about on these modules.\n\n508\n00:27:39.192 --> 00:27:40.990\nBut let's stop here and take a break.\n\n509\n00:27:40.990 --> 00:27:43.810\nWhen we get back, we're gonna see some of\nthe other information that we can pull out\n\n510\n00:27:43.810 --> 00:27:46.244\non these things, and some of the ways\nthat we can work with the modules.\n\n511\n00:27:46.244 --> 00:27:47.720\nSo definitely good stuff.\n\n512\n00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:48.808\nStay tuned for that.\n\n513\n00:27:48.808 --> 00:27:58.220\n[SOUND]\nAll right, welcome back, everybody.\n\n514\n00:27:58.220 --> 00:28:01.438\nSo in the last segment, module,\nwhatever the heck it was.\n\n515\n00:28:01.438 --> 00:28:04.032\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] I mentioned how we had udev,\n\n516\n00:28:04.032 --> 00:28:05.419\nwhich talked to HAL,\n\n517\n00:28:05.419 --> 00:28:11.060\nwhich talked through the D-Bus to get to\nthe various software out there, right?\n\n518\n00:28:11.060 --> 00:28:14.610\nWell, I mentioned how that HAL is\ncreating XML representations of all of\n\n519\n00:28:14.610 --> 00:28:15.560\nour hardware.\n\n520\n00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:16.620\nBut we haven't really seen that.\n\n521\n00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:19.617\nAnd I wanna show you kind of how\nthat works behind the scenes.\n\n522\n00:28:19.617 --> 00:28:23.538\nAnd again, this is stuff that most of us\ndon't have to deal with on a day-to-day,\n\n523\n00:28:23.538 --> 00:28:25.180\nor even month-to-month basis.\n\n524\n00:28:25.180 --> 00:28:28.780\nBut it's good to know, well, first off,\ncuz knowledge is power, right?\n\n525\n00:28:28.780 --> 00:28:30.450\nI think I learned that\nfrom Schoolhouse Rock.\n\n526\n00:28:30.450 --> 00:28:33.790\nAnd then the second thing is it's on exam.\n\n527\n00:28:33.790 --> 00:28:35.850\nSo again, if you wanna pass,\ngood stuff to know.\n\n528\n00:28:35.850 --> 00:28:39.610\nSo when I ran lsmod, and\nit pulled up the module list.\n\n529\n00:28:39.610 --> 00:28:42.980\nAnd I got to see the various hardware\nmodules that were loaded and running.\n\n530\n00:28:42.980 --> 00:28:44.340\nYeah, yeah, this guy right here.\n\n531\n00:28:44.340 --> 00:28:47.660\nSo when I ran that,\nwhere did that information come from?\n\n532\n00:28:47.660 --> 00:28:55.130\nWell, /dev is a folder that's packed full\nof file references to hardware, right?\n\n533\n00:28:55.130 --> 00:28:58.780\nBut it's not really packed full of\ninformation about the hardware.\n\n534\n00:28:58.780 --> 00:29:02.470\nA lot of that, we find in another\nfolder that is often ignored.\n\n535\n00:29:02.470 --> 00:29:05.845\nIf I take a look at my root here,\nyou'll see /dev,\n\n536\n00:29:05.845 --> 00:29:09.100\nwhich is what we were\njust poking around in.\n\n537\n00:29:09.100 --> 00:29:15.250\nBut you'll also see a folder called proc,\nP-R-O-C, that guy right there.\n\n538\n00:29:15.250 --> 00:29:17.060\nAnd in that folder,\n\n539\n00:29:17.060 --> 00:29:22.010\nwe have all sorts of stuff telling us\nabout processes running on our system.\n\n540\n00:29:22.010 --> 00:29:26.376\nWhich include the modules that are loaded\ninto the kernel, all right, or\n\n541\n00:29:26.376 --> 00:29:27.570\nkernel mods, all right?\n\n542\n00:29:27.570 --> 00:29:30.740\nSo we can go in there, and\nwe can poke around, and we can look.\n\n543\n00:29:30.740 --> 00:29:33.060\nWe can even load modules if we want.\n\n544\n00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:34.190\nWe don't normally have to, right?\n\n545\n00:29:34.190 --> 00:29:36.990\nCuz kmod, the kernel mod system,\n\n546\n00:29:36.990 --> 00:29:41.850\nis normally adding modules as hardware\nis added and removing them as needed.\n\n547\n00:29:41.850 --> 00:29:43.388\nActually, that leads me to another point.\n\n548\n00:29:43.388 --> 00:29:46.854\nI don't wanna get too distracted,\ncuz I'll forget to talk about proc.\n\n549\n00:29:46.854 --> 00:29:51.540\nBut in today's world, we have really\ntwo different types of hardware.\n\n550\n00:29:51.540 --> 00:29:55.000\nWe have a lot of hardware\nthat is hot pluggable.\n\n551\n00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:58.331\nThat means we can add and\nremove it while the system is on.\n\n552\n00:29:58.331 --> 00:30:00.580\nAnd then we have software\nthat is cold pluggable,\n\n553\n00:30:00.580 --> 00:30:03.080\nwhich means you have to shut\nthe computer off to change it.\n\n554\n00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:07.290\nSo when I first started\ngetting involved in computers,\n\n555\n00:30:07.290 --> 00:30:09.850\nalmost everything was cold pluggable.\n\n556\n00:30:09.850 --> 00:30:11.670\nIf you wanted to hook\na keyboard up to your computer,\n\n557\n00:30:11.670 --> 00:30:14.410\nit had to be hooked up when\nthe computer booted up.\n\n558\n00:30:14.410 --> 00:30:19.398\nIf you changed keyboards midstream,\nit didn't work, right?\n\n559\n00:30:19.398 --> 00:30:21.368\nSame thing with hard drives and\nstuff like that.\n\n560\n00:30:21.368 --> 00:30:23.660\nYou could not add them while\nthe systems was already on.\n\n561\n00:30:23.660 --> 00:30:25.880\nYou had to shut it off to do it.\n\n562\n00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:29.620\nBut in today's world,\nhot pluggable stuff is very, very common.\n\n563\n00:30:29.620 --> 00:30:34.146\nUSB, right, the Universal Serial Bus,\nevery USB device is hot pluggable.\n\n564\n00:30:34.146 --> 00:30:35.920\nYou add or remove it as you go.\n\n565\n00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:39.540\nWe have things like hot pluggable hard\ndrives in a lot of servers these days,\n\n566\n00:30:39.540 --> 00:30:43.070\nwhere you can add or\nremove hard drives while the system is on.\n\n567\n00:30:43.070 --> 00:30:46.425\nSo what used to be a lot easier for\nLinux was, hey, we boot up, and\n\n568\n00:30:46.425 --> 00:30:47.718\nwe look at the hardware.\n\n569\n00:30:47.718 --> 00:30:49.760\nAnd then we're done,\nwe don't look at it again.\n\n570\n00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:53.340\nNow, it's got to constantly monitor for\nthat hardware change,\n\n571\n00:30:53.340 --> 00:30:54.910\nand kmod is what does that.\n\n572\n00:30:54.910 --> 00:30:57.760\nAnd again, it's using /proc.\n\n573\n00:30:57.760 --> 00:31:01.731\nIt's using this folder to be able to get\nthe information about that hardware,\n\n574\n00:31:01.731 --> 00:31:04.028\nto pull the right modules,\nand to go with it.\n\n575\n00:31:04.028 --> 00:31:08.231\nNow, this is not an actual set of files,\nright?\n\n576\n00:31:08.231 --> 00:31:12.660\nThese are files that,\nthey represent the hardware.\n\n577\n00:31:12.660 --> 00:31:15.470\nThey represent these actual\nthings that are going on and\n\n578\n00:31:15.470 --> 00:31:16.970\nthe information that's\nassociated with them.\n\n579\n00:31:16.970 --> 00:31:19.867\nSo this is really just\nkind of a representation.\n\n580\n00:31:19.867 --> 00:31:23.440\nAll right, so when I ran lsmod,\nwhat did it really do?\n\n581\n00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:27.280\nWell, when I ran lsmod,\nit gave me a list of my modules.\n\n582\n00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:31.710\nAnd it got that from /proc,\nit's actually stuck right in there.\n\n583\n00:31:31.710 --> 00:31:37.078\nInside of /proc, there's a folder called\nmodules, or not a folder, it's a file.\n\n584\n00:31:37.078 --> 00:31:40.580\nAnd so there's a file called modules,\nand in it is a list of the modules.\n\n585\n00:31:40.580 --> 00:31:48.760\nAnd so if I run, here I'll use\nmore /proc/modules, all right.\n\n586\n00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:52.090\nI'm gonna see that same list,\nthe list that we had on the screen.\n\n587\n00:31:52.090 --> 00:31:54.600\nWell, it's not exactly the same, I guess.\n\n588\n00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:58.228\nI see all of my, not my processes,\nmy modules, right?\n\n589\n00:31:58.228 --> 00:32:02.780\nSo there's ipv6, ip_tables,\nall the ones that I saw with lsmod.\n\n590\n00:32:02.780 --> 00:32:06.782\nThe only difference is the information\nhere is not necessarily made for\n\n591\n00:32:06.782 --> 00:32:08.457\nhuman consumption, right?\n\n592\n00:32:08.457 --> 00:32:11.770\nSo you see some hexadecimal\nstrings over there is it\n\n593\n00:32:11.770 --> 00:32:15.210\nidentifies the information\nabout that module.\n\n594\n00:32:15.210 --> 00:32:18.120\nYou can see some process\nIDs attached to it.\n\n595\n00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:19.570\nThe size is there.\n\n596\n00:32:19.570 --> 00:32:22.170\nSo things are a little bit different,\nright?\n\n597\n00:32:22.170 --> 00:32:23.840\nNot quite human readable.\n\n598\n00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:28.580\nSo when we run LS mod,\nall it's doing is it's really doing like\n\n599\n00:32:28.580 --> 00:32:33.610\na cat slash proc slash modules right.\n\n600\n00:32:33.610 --> 00:32:37.400\nAnd then it's running some string\ntranslations to be able to represent\n\n601\n00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:38.620\nit in a human readable format.\n\n602\n00:32:40.050 --> 00:32:42.400\nWhich is what we see right here okay.\n\n603\n00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:45.510\nSo instead of just having a process id or\n\n604\n00:32:45.510 --> 00:32:48.890\nmodule id that references who it\nis that feeds off of this module.\n\n605\n00:32:48.890 --> 00:32:52.320\nIt instead translates it to a name and\ndisplays that way.\n\n606\n00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:53.380\nIt makes a lot more sense.\n\n607\n00:32:54.641 --> 00:32:59.540\nAll right, but that's an example\nof what's going on here in /proc.\n\n608\n00:32:59.540 --> 00:33:02.440\nFiles that are representations\nof something\n\n609\n00:33:02.440 --> 00:33:06.270\nthat's actually going on in the background\nin ram, running on your system.\n\n610\n00:33:06.270 --> 00:33:10.360\nAll right, now I mentioned how the modules\nshould be loaded automatically.\n\n611\n00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:15.310\nWe really shouldn't have to load our\nown modules, but we can if we need to.\n\n612\n00:33:15.310 --> 00:33:18.220\nThere is a utility called modprobe, right?\n\n613\n00:33:18.220 --> 00:33:23.510\nAnd, the modprobe utility is what will\nlet us load a module into memory or\n\n614\n00:33:23.510 --> 00:33:26.380\nunload, deload, unload.\n\n615\n00:33:26.380 --> 00:33:29.100\nWhatever is the right word\nthere I think it's on load,\n\n616\n00:33:29.100 --> 00:33:33.590\nyes to get it out of RAM if you want, so\nwe can use the modprobe command for that.\n\n617\n00:33:33.590 --> 00:33:37.510\nIf you run modprobe by itself\nit would just be modprobe\n\n618\n00:33:37.510 --> 00:33:38.830\nfollowed by a module name.\n\n619\n00:33:38.830 --> 00:33:42.860\nSo maybe I want that Intel\ne1000 module loaded, right.\n\n620\n00:33:42.860 --> 00:33:47.310\nThat if the module is not already\nloaded into RAM, that's gonna load it.\n\n621\n00:33:47.310 --> 00:33:47.820\nOkay?\n\n622\n00:33:47.820 --> 00:33:50.733\nSo, if it wasn't already in RAM,\nnow it is, and\n\n623\n00:33:50.733 --> 00:33:54.440\nnow my colonial is acting as if\nmodprobe was compiled into it.\n\n624\n00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:58.590\nAll right, you'll see a lot of\npeople do -v which is just verbose.\n\n625\n00:33:58.590 --> 00:33:59.290\nRight?\n\n626\n00:33:59.290 --> 00:34:03.900\nBut, it's really not that verbose,\nit's only verbose if an error happens.\n\n627\n00:34:03.900 --> 00:34:07.100\nSo, if I do modprobe dash v it's really\nthe same thing here because it's not any\n\n628\n00:34:07.100 --> 00:34:07.760\noutput for me to get.\n\n629\n00:34:08.820 --> 00:34:12.990\nNow, if I was experimenting with\nthe module, and I'm done with it,\n\n630\n00:34:12.990 --> 00:34:17.960\nI can remove it with modprobe also\nby doing a modprobe -r, right.\n\n631\n00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:23.450\nSo if I do lsmod, and I'm just gonna pipe\nthat into grep and I'll search for e1000.\n\n632\n00:34:23.450 --> 00:34:28.850\nAll right, so right there I can see\nthat I've got the e1000 module,\n\n633\n00:34:28.850 --> 00:34:31.370\nit is loaded, it's in RAM,\nnothing's using it.\n\n634\n00:34:31.370 --> 00:34:35.240\nSo I've got that zero tied to it,\nbut it is there and\n\n635\n00:34:35.240 --> 00:34:38.990\nnow I can say modprobe -r e1000.\n\n636\n00:34:38.990 --> 00:34:44.040\nAnd that's going to unload it or\nremove it from operation.\n\n637\n00:34:45.190 --> 00:34:49.590\nAnd if I redo my little search I can\nsee it's no longer loaded into RAM.\n\n638\n00:34:49.590 --> 00:34:53.720\nSo we can use modprobe to stick things\nin memory, take them out again.\n\n639\n00:34:53.720 --> 00:34:59.250\nUseful if you're testing, trying out new\nmodules, whatever, just to kinda see.\n\n640\n00:34:59.250 --> 00:35:00.099\nSee what's up.\n\n641\n00:35:00.099 --> 00:35:01.516\n>> Nice.\n\n642\n00:35:01.516 --> 00:35:06.049\n>> All right, now on the exam you never\nknow what commands they're gonna,\n\n643\n00:35:06.049 --> 00:35:08.810\nwell, I shouldn't say you'd never know.\n\n644\n00:35:08.810 --> 00:35:09.920\nWhoever wrote it knows.\n\n645\n00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:12.730\nBut, modprobe is what we use today.\n\n646\n00:35:12.730 --> 00:35:18.590\nThere are some older commands that\nyou could see creep up on the exam,\n\n647\n00:35:18.590 --> 00:35:22.460\nso modprobe is one of them.\n\n648\n00:35:22.460 --> 00:35:23.294\nThere are a few others, let's see.\n\n649\n00:35:23.294 --> 00:35:27.641\nI think I put them in my notes\nsomeone's I don't even use anymore.\n\n650\n00:35:27.641 --> 00:35:28.780\nThat's not the one I'm\nthinking of running.\n\n651\n00:35:28.780 --> 00:35:30.110\nThere's another one.\n\n652\n00:35:30.110 --> 00:35:31.070\nThere it is.\n\n653\n00:35:32.540 --> 00:35:34.750\nIf we wanna remove it.\n\n654\n00:35:34.750 --> 00:35:38.620\nI usually use modprobe-r because modprobe\nhas all this stuff built into it.\n\n655\n00:35:38.620 --> 00:35:44.120\nIn the early days it didn't, so we had\nsome other utilities like rmmod, right?\n\n656\n00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:49.110\nWhich was for removing a module, and\nso you'll see rmmod is still there\n\n657\n00:35:49.110 --> 00:35:53.100\nit's an older command,\nwe don't normally need it anymore.\n\n658\n00:35:53.100 --> 00:35:54.880\nSame thing with installing the module,\n\n659\n00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:59.740\nthere's insmod,\nwhich is installing a module, okay?\n\n660\n00:35:59.740 --> 00:36:02.980\nSo, remove module, install module.\n\n661\n00:36:02.980 --> 00:36:04.840\nRmmod, insmod.\n\n662\n00:36:04.840 --> 00:36:07.025\nThose are the older commands.\n\n663\n00:36:07.025 --> 00:36:08.630\nModprobe has it built in now,\n\n664\n00:36:08.630 --> 00:36:13.160\nso modprobe then the module name, or\nmodprobe -r to remove and the module name.\n\n665\n00:36:13.160 --> 00:36:14.320\nThat's typically what we use.\n\n666\n00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:15.970\nBut I just wanted to mention\nthese older commands,\n\n667\n00:36:15.970 --> 00:36:19.940\njust in case they creep up on the exam,\nyou know you might see those.\n\n668\n00:36:19.940 --> 00:36:20.660\nAll right.\n\n669\n00:36:20.660 --> 00:36:21.950\nAnd, like always,\n\n670\n00:36:21.950 --> 00:36:26.100\nI'm gonna post my own notes with\nthe episode so you'll have them.\n\n671\n00:36:26.100 --> 00:36:29.360\nI put them in there just as a safety net,\njust in case.\n\n672\n00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:31.980\n>> Yep.\n>> So, all right.\n\n673\n00:36:31.980 --> 00:36:33.270\nLet's see.\nWhat other damage do we\n\n674\n00:36:33.270 --> 00:36:33.870\nneed to do in here?\n\n675\n00:36:33.870 --> 00:36:37.040\nSo, /proc,\nit is packed full of information.\n\n676\n00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:39.140\nThere is a lot of stuff that's in there.\n\n677\n00:36:39.140 --> 00:36:42.320\nBasically, any hardware that comes\nup on your system is going to\n\n678\n00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:46.230\nbe registered in /dev\nas a hardware device.\n\n679\n00:36:46.230 --> 00:36:51.700\nAnd then all the other information about\nit is actually being stored over in /proc.\n\n680\n00:36:51.700 --> 00:36:53.420\nSo that's where that data goes.\n\n681\n00:36:53.420 --> 00:36:56.440\nSo if you ever wanna look up\nthe PCI ID for your hardware or\n\n682\n00:36:56.440 --> 00:37:00.000\nsomething like that,\n/proc is where we go, all right.\n\n683\n00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:04.100\nSo hopefully you never have to deal with\nthis right, your hardware's detected,\n\n684\n00:37:04.100 --> 00:37:05.730\nit works great and off you go.\n\n685\n00:37:05.730 --> 00:37:10.420\nBut if you have custom hardware, right or\njust hardware that's not very common,\n\n686\n00:37:10.420 --> 00:37:13.545\nyour Linux distribution of choice\nmight not support it yet, so\n\n687\n00:37:13.545 --> 00:37:16.455\nyou might need to get in there and\nkinda tweak it a little bit, and\n\n688\n00:37:16.455 --> 00:37:20.005\nsee what went wrong, try and\nfind the right modules.\n\n689\n00:37:20.005 --> 00:37:23.125\nAnd you'll usually have to get\nas much information as you can\n\n690\n00:37:23.125 --> 00:37:26.965\nto get the support you need to find\nout how to get that hardware running.\n\n691\n00:37:26.965 --> 00:37:28.035\nSo keep that in mind.\n\n692\n00:37:28.035 --> 00:37:31.265\nThere are some other commands\nthat we can run, like modinfo.\n\n693\n00:37:31.265 --> 00:37:36.020\nSo modprobe, we use that for\nadding modules or removing them.\n\n694\n00:37:36.020 --> 00:37:41.010\nModinfo will actually display\nus information about the module.\n\n695\n00:37:41.010 --> 00:37:43.720\nAnd it can be a little overkill for\nus, right?\n\n696\n00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:46.000\nLet me read you that.\n\n697\n00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:51.057\nI'm gonna pipe it into more here, so\nwe can, whoops, pipe that clear into more.\n\n698\n00:37:51.057 --> 00:37:51.557\nThere we go.\n\n699\n00:37:52.600 --> 00:37:57.100\nSo now when I just kind of,\nI did modinfo e1000, right?\n\n700\n00:37:58.130 --> 00:38:02.180\nI can see the file name, where that\nmodule is being loaded from, right here,\n\n701\n00:38:02.180 --> 00:38:06.580\nso here is where that actual\nmodule is stored, okay?\n\n702\n00:38:06.580 --> 00:38:09.910\nI can see the version number of it,\nthat's really important,\n\n703\n00:38:09.910 --> 00:38:14.800\nbecause if I'm having problems there might\nbe a newer version that's out there.\n\n704\n00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:16.300\nI get the nice name.\n\n705\n00:38:16.300 --> 00:38:18.870\nSo if you ever see a module and\nyou don't understand what it is,\n\n706\n00:38:18.870 --> 00:38:23.710\nmodinfo can show you the full name, which\nmight be a lot more descriptive right?\n\n707\n00:38:23.710 --> 00:38:26.180\nAnd then you can start to see\nother things, source versions.\n\n708\n00:38:26.180 --> 00:38:27.970\nYou start to see a lot of aliases here.\n\n709\n00:38:27.970 --> 00:38:29.015\nNow notice the alias.\n\n710\n00:38:29.015 --> 00:38:34.390\nPCI: and then it's giving a PCI ID for\nthat hardware.\n\n711\n00:38:34.390 --> 00:38:39.710\nIntel has manufactured more than\none product labeled as the e1000.\n\n712\n00:38:39.710 --> 00:38:43.650\nOver the years, they changed their chips,\nthey changed their dyes, and\n\n713\n00:38:43.650 --> 00:38:45.140\ntheir layouts and stuff.\n\n714\n00:38:45.140 --> 00:38:46.724\nBut it's still the same driver, right?\n\n715\n00:38:46.724 --> 00:38:51.546\nSo what they're doing is they're saying\nthis one module will work with all of\n\n716\n00:38:51.546 --> 00:38:54.140\nthese different PCI hardware IDs.\n\n717\n00:38:54.140 --> 00:38:59.980\nSo if you insert a PCI card it\nuses plugin play technology.\n\n718\n00:38:59.980 --> 00:39:04.267\nWhatever, [LAUGH] but it uses plugin\nplay to communicate with the PCI ID.\n\n719\n00:39:04.267 --> 00:39:07.725\nIt says here's my ID,\ndo you have a driver for me right?\n\n720\n00:39:07.725 --> 00:39:10.470\nAnd your Linux just will\nlook down this list.\n\n721\n00:39:10.470 --> 00:39:11.560\nAnd it'll say, yeah here.\n\n722\n00:39:11.560 --> 00:39:12.820\nI found it, it's this one.\n\n723\n00:39:12.820 --> 00:39:15.370\nIt might be the 12th revision\nof that network adapter.\n\n724\n00:39:15.370 --> 00:39:16.380\nBut it's the same driver.\n\n725\n00:39:16.380 --> 00:39:17.790\nSo that's what we're seeing here.\n\n726\n00:39:17.790 --> 00:39:21.830\nThese little asterisks are just saying\nthat there could be any number or\n\n727\n00:39:21.830 --> 00:39:23.180\ncombination of numbers in there.\n\n728\n00:39:23.180 --> 00:39:24.990\nCuz you might have five of\nthe same adapter in there.\n\n729\n00:39:24.990 --> 00:39:27.880\nSo you'll have different numbers\nrepresenting each one, but\n\n730\n00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:33.140\nthis is how it identifies which,\nwhich hardware works with this module.\n\n731\n00:39:33.140 --> 00:39:37.530\nSo that's a big one right there,\nthe e1000 because Intel has so\n\n732\n00:39:37.530 --> 00:39:40.980\nmany hardware revisions and\nbecause it is hardware.\n\n733\n00:39:40.980 --> 00:39:44.230\nSoftware modules are a little bit\ndifferent, like the iptables one.\n\n734\n00:39:44.230 --> 00:39:45.110\nLet me pull that one up.\n\n735\n00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:50.200\nIptables is software,\nit's a software firewall, all right?\n\n736\n00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:53.870\nIt treats it like a network adapter,\nbut it is software.\n\n737\n00:39:53.870 --> 00:39:56.710\nAnd so when I try and\ndo modinfo on it, look what I get.\n\n738\n00:39:56.710 --> 00:39:59.599\nCould not find module iptables,\nactually, that's not quite right, is it?\n\n739\n00:40:04.182 --> 00:40:06.210\nLet me make sure that I get that right.\n\n740\n00:40:06.210 --> 00:40:08.972\nNow, ip_tables,\nthat's probably why it's doing that.\n\n741\n00:40:08.972 --> 00:40:09.934\nThere we go.\n\n742\n00:40:09.934 --> 00:40:14.305\nSo I get iptables, and let me clear\nthis and start on a fresh screen,\n\n743\n00:40:14.305 --> 00:40:17.388\nbecause it's not nearly\nas much information.\n\n744\n00:40:17.388 --> 00:40:20.952\nOn the Intel one,\nI had all those PCI IDs, right?\n\n745\n00:40:20.952 --> 00:40:22.812\nBecause there's actual\nhardware tied to it.\n\n746\n00:40:22.812 --> 00:40:25.448\nBut with iptables, there's no hardware.\n\n747\n00:40:25.448 --> 00:40:28.450\nIt's just software, and so\nI see that information right here.\n\n748\n00:40:28.450 --> 00:40:31.360\nIt's the IPv4 packet filter.\n\n749\n00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:34.616\nIt's from the Netfilter Core Team,\nit's GPL'd,\n\n750\n00:40:34.616 --> 00:40:38.420\nhere's the source version and\nthat's it, okay?\n\n751\n00:40:38.420 --> 00:40:41.718\nSo you see software modules and\nhardware modules.\n\n752\n00:40:41.718 --> 00:40:44.708\nThe software is usually software\nthat masquerades as hardware.\n\n753\n00:40:44.708 --> 00:40:48.460\niptables is a firewall, so\nit masquerading as a firewall.\n\n754\n00:40:48.460 --> 00:40:51.053\nYou send data into it,\ndata comes out of it, so\n\n755\n00:40:51.053 --> 00:40:53.859\nit's almost like two net\ncards in the processor.\n\n756\n00:40:53.859 --> 00:40:57.600\nBut it's all virtual, so\nwe don't have any PCI ID's.\n\n757\n00:40:57.600 --> 00:41:02.658\nAll right, so what about actual\nPCI devices though, okay?\n\n758\n00:41:02.658 --> 00:41:09.330\nWhen I did the information for\nthe E1000, I saw all those PCI IDs.\n\n759\n00:41:09.330 --> 00:41:13.338\nWell, I might stick an E1000 adapter\nin my computer and it works, right?\n\n760\n00:41:13.338 --> 00:41:15.493\nSo I know it matched with one of these,\nbut\n\n761\n00:41:15.493 --> 00:41:19.340\nmaybe I wanna know which one it\nmatched for some sordid reason.\n\n762\n00:41:19.340 --> 00:41:24.030\nOr maybe I put in a E1000 and it didn't\nmatch and it's not working, right?\n\n763\n00:41:24.030 --> 00:41:25.948\nAnd I'm like well, I got this module.\n\n764\n00:41:25.948 --> 00:41:27.670\nIt should of worked.\n\n765\n00:41:27.670 --> 00:41:31.811\nI can go find the PCI ID of the actual\nhardware I just installed and\n\n766\n00:41:31.811 --> 00:41:35.508\ncompare it to this list and\nsee if it's in the alias list.\n\n767\n00:41:35.508 --> 00:41:38.629\nMaybe it's just a newer version that's\njust not in this alias list yet and\n\n768\n00:41:38.629 --> 00:41:40.908\nI need to go and\nget an updated version of this module.\n\n769\n00:41:40.908 --> 00:41:42.708\nThat happens, okay?\n\n770\n00:41:42.708 --> 00:41:45.930\nAnd so if that's the case,\nI might wanna find that information.\n\n771\n00:41:45.930 --> 00:41:50.510\nWell, it's more stuff that's\nstashed away in the proc folder.\n\n772\n00:41:50.510 --> 00:41:55.188\nNow just like lsmod, lsmod gave us\na nice easy way to see that information.\n\n773\n00:41:55.188 --> 00:41:57.820\nI could have browsed in here and\nfound it myself.\n\n774\n00:41:57.820 --> 00:42:03.177\nWell, for looking at your PCI bus,\nwe have a nice little, easy command for\n\n775\n00:42:03.177 --> 00:42:08.038\nthat too, which is lspci,\nwhich is just lists all the PCI devices.\n\n776\n00:42:08.038 --> 00:42:11.808\nSo give me a list of all\nthe stuff that's there, all right?\n\n777\n00:42:11.808 --> 00:42:20.938\nNow on a positive side,\nIt is really human readable, right?\n\n778\n00:42:20.938 --> 00:42:25.374\nSo I can see, there's my Intel 440bx,\nwhatever chipset, and\n\n779\n00:42:25.374 --> 00:42:30.778\nas you kinda go down the line, I can see\nmy PCI bridges for VMware and other stuff.\n\n780\n00:42:30.778 --> 00:42:36.298\nThere's an ethernet controller,\nan Intel 82545EM Gigabit, whatever.\n\n781\n00:42:36.298 --> 00:42:38.108\nAnd I can see the PC IDs.\n\n782\n00:42:38.108 --> 00:42:41.030\nPCI IDs on the left side,\nit's hard to say.\n\n783\n00:42:41.030 --> 00:42:43.547\nSo over there, so\nI've got the bus number and\n\n784\n00:42:43.547 --> 00:42:47.466\nthe ID of the individual device, so\nI can see that off on the left side.\n\n785\n00:42:47.466 --> 00:42:52.478\nSo this Ethernet adapter is 02:01.1,\nright?\n\n786\n00:42:52.478 --> 00:42:55.430\nThat is part of the PCI ID, right?\n\n787\n00:42:55.430 --> 00:42:56.870\nBut it's not the whole thing.\n\n788\n00:42:56.870 --> 00:43:01.720\nThe whole detailed thing that is\nbeing obscured here because it's\n\n789\n00:43:01.720 --> 00:43:05.310\nnot something that we normally as\nhuman beings want to see, right?\n\n790\n00:43:05.310 --> 00:43:09.830\nBut that information is there,\nit's just being hidden with lspci.\n\n791\n00:43:09.830 --> 00:43:14.278\nWe also have lsusb that's another one.\n\n792\n00:43:14.278 --> 00:43:17.514\nSo pretty much in today's world, when\nyou plug something into your computer,\n\n793\n00:43:17.514 --> 00:43:19.513\nit's either connecting to the PCI bus,\nright?\n\n794\n00:43:19.513 --> 00:43:23.070\nYour PCI Express boards,\nyour eSATA ports, things like that, or\n\n795\n00:43:23.070 --> 00:43:24.478\nit's plugging into USB.\n\n796\n00:43:24.478 --> 00:43:27.158\nThose are pretty much the two\nways things connect now.\n\n797\n00:43:27.158 --> 00:43:32.128\nSo lsusb is the other one and it'll show\nany USB devices that I have attached.\n\n798\n00:43:32.128 --> 00:43:35.864\nI don't actually have any USB\ndevices attached to this one.\n\n799\n00:43:35.864 --> 00:43:36.364\nDo we have one?\n\n800\n00:43:36.364 --> 00:43:39.606\nDo we have a USB key or\nsomething that I can experiment?\n\n801\n00:43:39.606 --> 00:43:42.572\nYeah, we probably have another USB\nnetwork adapter up here, don't we?\n\n802\n00:43:42.572 --> 00:43:46.390\nNo, [LAUGH] I thought we did.\n\n803\n00:43:46.390 --> 00:43:49.738\nI was gonna show just kind\nof throw one on here.\n\n804\n00:43:49.738 --> 00:43:51.800\nI'll steal yours, thank you, Ronnie.\n\n805\n00:43:51.800 --> 00:43:56.170\nSo here, I'll just take this USB\ndevice and I'm gonna chuck it on here.\n\n806\n00:43:56.170 --> 00:44:00.188\nI don't actually know if Linux\nhas a driver for this one, so.\n\n807\n00:44:05.526 --> 00:44:08.120\nNice, okay, so\nI just threw in this USB device.\n\n808\n00:44:08.120 --> 00:44:09.310\nIt's a USB network adapter.\n\n809\n00:44:09.310 --> 00:44:12.480\nI have no idea if Linux actually\nhas a driver for it or not.\n\n810\n00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:13.718\nSo it picked it up.\n\n811\n00:44:13.718 --> 00:44:17.738\nIt got some information unable to\nenumerate USB device on port one.\n\n812\n00:44:17.738 --> 00:44:21.589\nI think my problem is I plugged\ninto a USB 3.0 port and\n\n813\n00:44:21.589 --> 00:44:25.191\nVMWare Fusion isn't very\nnice with USB 3.0, so\n\n814\n00:44:25.191 --> 00:44:30.800\nI think it's a little ticked off, so\nI got some errors there on the device.\n\n815\n00:44:30.800 --> 00:44:35.438\nBut if I do lsusb now, I can see,\nyeah, it didn't add it.\n\n816\n00:44:35.438 --> 00:44:37.798\nShoot, yeah, it's unhappy.\n\n817\n00:44:37.798 --> 00:44:40.590\nAll right, well, that's gonna do it\nbecause I'm on a virtual machine.\n\n818\n00:44:40.590 --> 00:44:44.238\nBut basically, it'll list the USB devices\nthat are attached and that's really handy.\n\n819\n00:44:44.238 --> 00:44:48.218\nBecause you might be having a problem with\nthat USB device, it might not be detected.\n\n820\n00:44:48.218 --> 00:44:51.176\nAnd I see this all the time with those\nlittle serial port adapters I was\n\n821\n00:44:51.176 --> 00:44:52.290\ntalking about.\n\n822\n00:44:52.290 --> 00:44:56.420\nThere are 20 different vendors out there\nthat make those USB to serial port\n\n823\n00:44:56.420 --> 00:45:01.860\nadapters, but there's really only two\nchipset manufacturers that buy it.\n\n824\n00:45:01.860 --> 00:45:04.116\nAnd like the one that you and\nI use, the Prolific?\n\n825\n00:45:04.116 --> 00:45:06.662\n>> Right.\n>> And so the brand might be NETGEAR or\n\n826\n00:45:06.662 --> 00:45:10.253\nwhatever, but on the inside,\nit's a Prolific chip and so\n\n827\n00:45:10.253 --> 00:45:12.535\nyou need the Prolific driver.\n\n828\n00:45:12.535 --> 00:45:14.871\nWell, you can use LSUSB and in the id,\n\n829\n00:45:14.871 --> 00:45:19.698\nyou'll see that it's the Prolific adapter\nand not whatever the other one is.\n\n830\n00:45:19.698 --> 00:45:20.938\nI forget the other brand.\n\n831\n00:45:20.938 --> 00:45:23.458\nIt's like something weird.\n\n832\n00:45:23.458 --> 00:45:27.638\nAnyhow, so that's another utility there.\n\n833\n00:45:27.638 --> 00:45:30.890\nlspci for listing PCI devices.\n\n834\n00:45:30.890 --> 00:45:33.996\nlsusb for listing the USB ones.\n\n835\n00:45:33.996 --> 00:45:36.270\nAll right, other stuff.\n\n836\n00:45:36.270 --> 00:45:40.520\nNow I mentioned that there's some really\ndetailed information tucked away under\n\n837\n00:45:41.790 --> 00:45:43.440\nhere for finding out what's going on.\n\n838\n00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:47.770\nWell, /proc does have some\ninformation about the modules, but\n\n839\n00:45:47.770 --> 00:45:51.850\nit doesn't necessarily have\nthe information about the hardware itself.\n\n840\n00:45:51.850 --> 00:45:54.788\nFor that, we have to dive\ninto another special folder.\n\n841\n00:45:54.788 --> 00:45:58.420\nSo let's recap the special\nfolders we've hit so far.\n\n842\n00:45:58.420 --> 00:46:02.211\nSo we've talked about, hang on.\n\n843\n00:46:02.211 --> 00:46:04.930\nLet me, There.\n\n844\n00:46:05.970 --> 00:46:08.658\nSo we've talked about so far /dev and\n\n845\n00:46:08.658 --> 00:46:12.698\nthat's where our representations\nof the hardware are.\n\n846\n00:46:12.698 --> 00:46:16.275\nAnd then we talked about /proc and that's\nwhere we get information as far as what\n\n847\n00:46:16.275 --> 00:46:20.360\nwas detected and basic information about\nthe kernel modules that are loaded.\n\n848\n00:46:20.360 --> 00:46:25.239\nThe third folder that deals with hardware\nis this guy down here, /sys, all right?\n\n849\n00:46:25.239 --> 00:46:27.798\nNow sys is the weird one, all right?\n\n850\n00:46:27.798 --> 00:46:31.868\nIt's short for the system file\nsystem that's kind of redundant or\n\n851\n00:46:31.868 --> 00:46:34.640\nsysfs is what you hear\na lot of people call it.\n\n852\n00:46:34.640 --> 00:46:39.140\nAnd it's a special one because this is\nthe one that actually contains the true\n\n853\n00:46:39.140 --> 00:46:42.230\ninformation about the hardware\nin our system, all right?\n\n854\n00:46:42.230 --> 00:46:44.280\nThe modules are needed to\naddress this hardware,\n\n855\n00:46:44.280 --> 00:46:48.760\nbut this is where the actual hardware\nis mapped, the true real thing.\n\n856\n00:46:48.760 --> 00:46:53.948\nSo when we talk about a PCI bus,\nyou'll see the PCI bus in sys, all right?\n\n857\n00:46:53.948 --> 00:46:59.558\nsys actually shows up when you run the\nmount command and you can see it in here.\n\n858\n00:46:59.558 --> 00:47:01.818\nAnd it's in here somewhere, there.\n\n859\n00:47:01.818 --> 00:47:05.858\nSysfs on /sys type sysfs.\n\n860\n00:47:05.858 --> 00:47:09.102\nSo the system file system\nis mounted on /sys and\n\n861\n00:47:09.102 --> 00:47:12.598\nit's the system file system format type,\nright?\n\n862\n00:47:12.598 --> 00:47:15.941\nIt's not a normal format, It's not\nsomething we can copy files to because\n\n863\n00:47:15.941 --> 00:47:17.758\nit's our actual hardware, all right?\n\n864\n00:47:17.758 --> 00:47:21.670\nAnd if you poke around in /sys,\nit's kinda interesting, right?\n\n865\n00:47:21.670 --> 00:47:25.392\nSo if I look in here,\nyou can see block devices,\n\n866\n00:47:25.392 --> 00:47:29.968\nso that's going be your hard drives,\nyour file systems.\n\n867\n00:47:29.968 --> 00:47:33.054\nWe've got dev and devices, firmware,\n\n868\n00:47:33.054 --> 00:47:37.047\nkernel, modules, power for\nyour power states, so\n\n869\n00:47:37.047 --> 00:47:43.110\nall sorts of really low level hardware\ninteraction found right in here.\n\n870\n00:47:43.110 --> 00:47:46.404\nAnd if we poke around in bus\nthat's the good one, right?\n\n871\n00:47:46.404 --> 00:47:50.627\nSo my present working director\nright now is /sys/bus\n\n872\n00:47:50.627 --> 00:47:54.768\nthat's where we're gonna see our PCI and\nUSB buses.\n\n873\n00:47:54.768 --> 00:47:57.848\nNow you might see more.\n\n874\n00:47:57.848 --> 00:48:00.480\nI keep piping this through the more\ncommand just to strip off the colors\n\n875\n00:48:00.480 --> 00:48:01.420\nreal quick.\n\n876\n00:48:01.420 --> 00:48:04.860\nBut you'll see in here\nwhen I look at my buses,\n\n877\n00:48:04.860 --> 00:48:07.604\nI've got my USB right there and PCI.\n\n878\n00:48:07.604 --> 00:48:10.990\nI've got pci_express listed separately and\non your system they might,\n\n879\n00:48:10.990 --> 00:48:12.144\nactually map together.\n\n880\n00:48:12.144 --> 00:48:12.899\nSometimes they do.\n\n881\n00:48:12.899 --> 00:48:14.640\nSometimes they are truly separate.\n\n882\n00:48:14.640 --> 00:48:18.145\nBut you'll see each of the different buses\nwhere we might detect hardware that's\n\n883\n00:48:18.145 --> 00:48:18.971\nbeing plugged in.\n\n884\n00:48:18.971 --> 00:48:23.531\nHID, that's a Human Interface Device,\nlike keyboard and mouse, and\n\n885\n00:48:23.531 --> 00:48:25.130\nyou'll see other ones.\n\n886\n00:48:25.130 --> 00:48:27.450\nAnd even there,\nthat might be plugged into a USB.\n\n887\n00:48:29.860 --> 00:48:35.027\nSo if I go into pci,, now things\nstart to get creative cuz in here\n\n888\n00:48:35.027 --> 00:48:40.199\nI see the devices themselves,\nthe drivers that we've loaded,\n\n889\n00:48:40.199 --> 00:48:45.876\nthe autoprobe and the manual probe\ndrivers so I can start to see those.\n\n890\n00:48:45.876 --> 00:48:48.962\nI can force a rescan, I see my slots.\n\n891\n00:48:48.962 --> 00:48:50.767\nAnd these are not things\nthat I can manipulate,\n\n892\n00:48:50.767 --> 00:48:53.670\nthese are things that are being shown\nto me as information about the system.\n\n893\n00:48:53.670 --> 00:48:58.980\nThis is not something that I can\nactually change or modify from here.\n\n894\n00:48:58.980 --> 00:49:03.050\nWhen I use modprobe,\nI can load in modules and I can go.\n\n895\n00:49:03.050 --> 00:49:05.220\nAnd it's actually making\nthe changes here for me.\n\n896\n00:49:05.220 --> 00:49:06.210\nI can't make the change directly.\n\n897\n00:49:06.210 --> 00:49:11.667\nI can't just copy a driver into this\ndrivers folder cuz it's not a real folder.\n\n898\n00:49:11.667 --> 00:49:16.129\nAnd so, if I were to poke around in here,\nif I were to go into like devices.\n\n899\n00:49:18.310 --> 00:49:24.580\nSo my directory now is\n/sys/bus/pci/devices.\n\n900\n00:49:24.580 --> 00:49:27.402\nNow, I see some really cool stuff.\n\n901\n00:49:27.402 --> 00:49:30.800\nI'm seeing little more than\nwhat will fit on the screen.\n\n902\n00:49:30.800 --> 00:49:31.620\nThere you go.\n\n903\n00:49:31.620 --> 00:49:35.450\nI'm seeing a list of all the PCIDs and\n\n904\n00:49:35.450 --> 00:49:41.477\nyou might remember seeing\nthose on the screen earlier,\n\n905\n00:49:41.477 --> 00:49:48.560\nwhat was the E1 or the Intel adapter?\n\n906\n00:49:48.560 --> 00:49:53.080\nMy Intel adapter there, 02:01.0.\n\n907\n00:49:53.080 --> 00:49:57.559\nSo when I look around in here I should\nbe able to find that buried in here\n\n908\n00:49:57.559 --> 00:49:58.417\nsomewhere.\n\n909\n00:49:58.417 --> 00:50:01.584\nUnless it's on a different, here it is.\n\n910\n00:50:01.584 --> 00:50:04.251\nActually is my head covering\nthat I think it is.\n\n911\n00:50:04.251 --> 00:50:04.878\nRight here.\nSo\n\n912\n00:50:04.878 --> 00:50:09.890\nI've got 02:01.0 that's\nrepresenting my network adapter.\n\n913\n00:50:11.050 --> 00:50:13.920\nNow, as a human being that\ndoesn't mean anything to me.\n\n914\n00:50:13.920 --> 00:50:16.940\nBut as far as a computer\ntrying to find where on\n\n915\n00:50:16.940 --> 00:50:19.830\nthe PCI bus that network adapter is,\nthat's the information it needs.\n\n916\n00:50:19.830 --> 00:50:21.130\nThat's it right there.\n\n917\n00:50:21.130 --> 00:50:26.106\nSo if I change into that\ndirectory [BLANK AUDIO]\n\n918\n00:50:26.106 --> 00:50:29.290\nthere and I take a look,\nnow I can start to see\n\n919\n00:50:29.290 --> 00:50:33.340\nall sorts of additional representations\nof the IRQs attached to it.\n\n920\n00:50:33.340 --> 00:50:37.792\nYou'll see if it's got a NUMA node for\nspanning across memory.\n\n921\n00:50:37.792 --> 00:50:41.148\nYou've got other resources\nthat might be attached to it,\n\n922\n00:50:41.148 --> 00:50:45.543\nthe ACP high index for power information,\nthe device itself, the config.\n\n923\n00:50:45.543 --> 00:50:49.982\nYou're seeing all of this, these are\nrepresentations of information about that\n\n924\n00:50:49.982 --> 00:50:52.610\ndevice, so lots of stuff buried in there.\n\n925\n00:50:52.610 --> 00:50:56.080\nAnd this, at the end of the day,\nreally what udev is mapping\n\n926\n00:50:56.080 --> 00:51:00.060\nto those entries in /dev,\nit's all buried away in here.\n\n927\n00:51:01.100 --> 00:51:06.496\nSo when we run modinfo, and it's pulling\nup information about a module, when we run\n\n928\n00:51:06.496 --> 00:51:11.751\nlsmod and all those guys, they're pulling\ninformation from a number of places.\n\n929\n00:51:11.751 --> 00:51:17.910\nThey're pulling information from /proc and\n/sys and in some cases /dev also.\n\n930\n00:51:17.910 --> 00:51:22.390\nThose three work together to\nrepresent the hardware on our system.\n\n931\n00:51:24.290 --> 00:51:27.252\nAnd you can see some cool stuff in here.\n\n932\n00:51:27.252 --> 00:51:32.284\nIf we do like [BLANK AUDIO]\npull out the more./modalias,\n\n933\n00:51:32.284 --> 00:51:38.020\nthat's where I can actually see\nthe PCID for my network adapter.\n\n934\n00:51:38.020 --> 00:51:44.120\nRemember, we saw that list of PCI aliases\nthat were supported by this system.\n\n935\n00:51:44.120 --> 00:51:51.172\nWell, that was modinfo e1000.\n\n936\n00:51:51.172 --> 00:51:52.480\nLet me grep that.\n\n937\n00:51:56.627 --> 00:51:57.127\nOops.\n\n938\n00:52:05.501 --> 00:52:10.333\nI wanna do modinfo [LAUGH] e1000.\n\n939\n00:52:10.333 --> 00:52:12.260\nI wanna grep for alias.\n\n940\n00:52:12.260 --> 00:52:13.420\nThere.\n\n941\n00:52:13.420 --> 00:52:17.760\nSo here's the list of pci aliases\nthat are in the e1000 module.\n\n942\n00:52:19.242 --> 00:52:24.305\nAnd then, if I look into the module\nalias for this particular pci adapter\n\n943\n00:52:24.305 --> 00:52:28.959\nI can see here is where mine is and\nstart to compare that to the list.\n\n944\n00:52:28.959 --> 00:52:31.970\nAnd if it's using the e1000 driver,\nI'll find a match in here.\n\n945\n00:52:31.970 --> 00:52:35.910\nI don't think it is cuz this\nis a different adapter.\n\n946\n00:52:35.910 --> 00:52:37.020\nBut if I see a match.\n\n947\n00:52:37.020 --> 00:52:41.370\nNow, anywhere there's a star,\nso see I've got sv*sd and\n\n948\n00:52:41.370 --> 00:52:45.895\nlooking down here I've got sv000015AD and\nthen sd, so\n\n949\n00:52:45.895 --> 00:52:51.740\nthat 000015AD, that's a unique\nidentifier for this particular card.\n\n950\n00:52:51.740 --> 00:52:53.991\nIf I have more than one in the same card,\n\n951\n00:52:53.991 --> 00:52:58.030\nthey'll each have a slightly\ndifferent unique identifier.\n\n952\n00:52:58.030 --> 00:53:00.430\nAnd so, I could try and find a match here,\n\n953\n00:53:00.430 --> 00:53:03.920\nit might take me an hour to\nactually go through and find the X.\n\n954\n00:53:03.920 --> 00:53:08.468\nI don't think I'll find a match though\ncuz this is an 8285 card versus the e1000\n\n955\n00:53:08.468 --> 00:53:09.584\nwhich is different.\n\n956\n00:53:09.584 --> 00:53:11.140\nSo that's what's going on.\n\n957\n00:53:11.140 --> 00:53:13.610\nIt's doing all this for\nus in background which is great, so\n\n958\n00:53:13.610 --> 00:53:17.430\nthat we don't have to match that up.\n\n959\n00:53:17.430 --> 00:53:20.750\nAnd what we end up with at\nthe end of the day is a nice,\n\n960\n00:53:20.750 --> 00:53:26.030\neasy to use slash dev folder so that I\ndon't have to figure out what driver and\n\n961\n00:53:26.030 --> 00:53:27.980\nwhat module my network adapter is using.\n\n962\n00:53:27.980 --> 00:53:31.126\nI just need to know that\nI've got a /dev/eth0.\n\n963\n00:53:31.126 --> 00:53:37.626\nAnd that, at the zero is\npointing to my network adapter.\n\n964\n00:53:37.626 --> 00:53:40.876\nBut actually it would\nbe in the net folder.\n\n965\n00:53:40.876 --> 00:53:42.050\nNo, I got my tunnel there.\n\n966\n00:53:43.520 --> 00:53:46.084\nWell, anyhow, so my hard drive.\n\n967\n00:53:46.084 --> 00:53:47.160\nSo /dev/sda.\n\n968\n00:53:47.160 --> 00:53:50.908\nThat's what I know, I don't have to\nknow the actual SCSI bus ID for it or\n\n969\n00:53:50.908 --> 00:53:52.043\nanything like that.\n\n970\n00:53:52.043 --> 00:53:55.001\nSo makes life a lot easier.\n\n971\n00:53:55.001 --> 00:53:57.656\nWell, looking at the clock we're a little\nshort on time for this segment so\n\n972\n00:53:57.656 --> 00:53:58.340\nlet's stop here.\n\n973\n00:53:58.340 --> 00:54:00.917\nI've got a lot more hardware stuff\nto talk about when we get back.\n\n974\n00:54:00.917 --> 00:54:04.735\nWe need to dig into actually\nmaking some pool manipulations and\n\n975\n00:54:04.735 --> 00:54:09.502\ndoing some things there, so stay tuned for\nthat and we'll be back after this.\n\n976\n00:54:09.502 --> 00:54:13.293\n>> Sounds good.\n\n977\n00:54:13.293 --> 00:54:18.960\n>> [SOUND] Welcome back.\n\n978\n00:54:18.960 --> 00:54:22.709\nSo before I jump into my next topic,\nI do wanna touch on something real quick.\n\n979\n00:54:22.709 --> 00:54:26.203\nAt the end of that last segment,\nI mentioned how we just have /dev, and\n\n980\n00:54:26.203 --> 00:54:28.080\nthere's our hardware represented.\n\n981\n00:54:28.080 --> 00:54:32.130\nI mentioned a network adapter, and\nyou might have noticed it wasn't there.\n\n982\n00:54:32.130 --> 00:54:35.890\nLinux is one of the few variants\nof Unix that doesn't actually\n\n983\n00:54:35.890 --> 00:54:38.340\nrepresent the network adapter in /dev.\n\n984\n00:54:38.340 --> 00:54:42.041\nSo you'll see all your hardware in\nthere except your network adapters.\n\n985\n00:54:42.041 --> 00:54:44.360\nIt runs those dynamically in software.\n\n986\n00:54:44.360 --> 00:54:47.510\nSo you'll see your network adapters in\nslash like I was doing all through out\n\n987\n00:54:47.510 --> 00:54:48.540\nthe show earlier.\n\n988\n00:54:48.540 --> 00:54:51.890\nBut they won't show up in /dev,\nso just be aware of that.\n\n989\n00:54:51.890 --> 00:54:54.160\nThat was the reason why they\nweren't showing up in there.\n\n990\n00:54:54.160 --> 00:54:58.810\nYour sound card, your CPU, your memory,\nall those guys, they show up under /dev.\n\n991\n00:54:58.810 --> 00:55:01.020\nJust the network cards,\nyou handle a little specially.\n\n992\n00:55:01.020 --> 00:55:02.300\nSo that was it.\n\n993\n00:55:02.300 --> 00:55:07.611\nAnd if you jump over to a BSD or\na true Unix, this system,\n\n994\n00:55:07.611 --> 00:55:13.501\nyou may well see eth0 or\nwhatever in /dev, but not in Linux.\n\n995\n00:55:13.501 --> 00:55:17.350\nSo let's talk about what we do\nwhen our hardware is weird.\n\n996\n00:55:17.350 --> 00:55:21.550\nOur hardware might not always match\nthe standard need of a PC, and\n\n997\n00:55:21.550 --> 00:55:24.880\nas an example,\nI wanna give you guys a true story.\n\n998\n00:55:24.880 --> 00:55:31.450\nSo at home, I needed a firewall for my\nhome network, And I had a Cisco ASA box.\n\n999\n00:55:31.450 --> 00:55:33.620\nAnd the Cisco firewalls,\nthey're good firewalls.\n\n1000\n00:55:33.620 --> 00:55:37.420\nBut their licensing and their cost and\nstuff is outrageous, through the roof.\n\n1001\n00:55:37.420 --> 00:55:40.959\nSo I actually have a software\nfirewall that I built myself.\n\n1002\n00:55:40.959 --> 00:55:43.986\nI threw together a little PC,\nthrew some software on there, and\n\n1003\n00:55:43.986 --> 00:55:45.790\nnow it's a firewall.\n\n1004\n00:55:45.790 --> 00:55:49.040\nI actually got the idea from our producer,\nNate Copeland, and\n\n1005\n00:55:49.040 --> 00:55:53.550\nit's been working great for,\nI don't know, the year I've had it now.\n\n1006\n00:55:53.550 --> 00:55:59.480\nWell, on that little firewall, I'm running\nan operating system, but I do not have\n\n1007\n00:55:59.480 --> 00:56:03.230\na keyboard and mouse hooked up to it and\nI do not have a monitor hooked up to it.\n\n1008\n00:56:03.230 --> 00:56:04.691\nI just don't have those devices attached.\n\n1009\n00:56:04.691 --> 00:56:08.348\nIn my case, it's a special use system.\n\n1010\n00:56:08.348 --> 00:56:11.193\nIt's not like I'm firing up a GUI and\nbrowsing the Internet on it.\n\n1011\n00:56:11.193 --> 00:56:15.368\nIt's just a firewall, but when you\nhave a special use system like that,\n\n1012\n00:56:15.368 --> 00:56:18.620\nyou will often times have\nspecial hardware needs.\n\n1013\n00:56:18.620 --> 00:56:21.623\nYou may need to load additional kernel\nmodules to be able to reference\n\n1014\n00:56:21.623 --> 00:56:24.966\nthe hardware you're using or you might\nhave a quad-port network adapter.\n\n1015\n00:56:24.966 --> 00:56:25.920\nThat's not normal, right?\n\n1016\n00:56:25.920 --> 00:56:29.900\nBut they sell them for servers, and so\nyou may need to load the modules for that.\n\n1017\n00:56:29.900 --> 00:56:33.490\nBut what about if you're\nmissing a core component?\n\n1018\n00:56:33.490 --> 00:56:35.580\nIf you don't have a monitor,\nif you don't have a keyboard,\n\n1019\n00:56:35.580 --> 00:56:36.660\nif you don't have a mouse?\n\n1020\n00:56:36.660 --> 00:56:37.780\nWell, there's some things that we can do.\n\n1021\n00:56:37.780 --> 00:56:40.820\nAnd something that's really\ncommon is what I did on mine,\n\n1022\n00:56:40.820 --> 00:56:43.390\nyou can redirect your screen output.\n\n1023\n00:56:43.390 --> 00:56:45.390\nAnd say hey,\ninstead of throwing this output here,\n\n1024\n00:56:45.390 --> 00:56:49.610\nthis shell, instead of throwing\nthat out onto a monitor,\n\n1025\n00:56:49.610 --> 00:56:52.040\nwhy don't you send it out my serial port,\nokay?\n\n1026\n00:56:52.040 --> 00:56:56.120\nSo if you get a Cisco router,\nJuniper, 3com, HP Procurve stuff,\n\n1027\n00:56:56.120 --> 00:57:00.750\nany of that, all of those devices\nhave console ports on them.\n\n1028\n00:57:00.750 --> 00:57:04.940\nSerial ports, that display the command\nline interface for that device, and\n\n1029\n00:57:04.940 --> 00:57:07.280\nyou can do the same thing with Linux.\n\n1030\n00:57:07.280 --> 00:57:10.910\nWe just need to override\nthe normal behavior of the system.\n\n1031\n00:57:10.910 --> 00:57:13.340\nAnd we typically do that\nthrough kernel flags.\n\n1032\n00:57:14.350 --> 00:57:17.390\nWhen you boot the operating system up,\nit loads your kernel, right?\n\n1033\n00:57:17.390 --> 00:57:22.320\nWe saw that in the grub episode,\nwhere we covered installing a boot loader.\n\n1034\n00:57:22.320 --> 00:57:27.350\nAnd so\nif I take a look inside of /boot/grub and\n\n1035\n00:57:27.350 --> 00:57:30.860\nI pull up the grub.conf file, right,\n\n1036\n00:57:30.860 --> 00:57:35.170\nyou can see in here where\nit's got my operating system.\n\n1037\n00:57:35.170 --> 00:57:40.280\nIt's kind of a mess, but here we've got\nCentOS, and any information about it.\n\n1038\n00:57:40.280 --> 00:57:42.130\nAnd here it's loading the kernel.\n\n1039\n00:57:42.130 --> 00:57:46.900\nAnd that's followed immediately by\na long stream of kernel flags, right?\n\n1040\n00:57:46.900 --> 00:57:49.020\nRoot, where the root drive is, and\n\n1041\n00:57:49.020 --> 00:57:52.890\nthen you'll see somewhere\nwhere the init is here.\n\n1042\n00:57:52.890 --> 00:57:54.860\nThe initrd, that initial ram disk.\n\n1043\n00:57:54.860 --> 00:57:56.420\nSo, you'll see that information and\n\n1044\n00:57:56.420 --> 00:57:59.820\nyou'll see all sorts of other things about\nwhat keyboard type I have and so on.\n\n1045\n00:57:59.820 --> 00:58:03.340\nThese are all modifiers to\nthe kernel at boot time.\n\n1046\n00:58:03.340 --> 00:58:08.040\nIf you've got weird hardware, you may\nhave to use certain kernel flags to get\n\n1047\n00:58:08.040 --> 00:58:11.570\nthe kernel happy with whatever situation\nit is you're throwing at it, all right?\n\n1048\n00:58:11.570 --> 00:58:12.990\nSo for my system at home,\n\n1049\n00:58:12.990 --> 00:58:16.800\nI had to throw some kernel flags on\nthere to say, redirect that output.\n\n1050\n00:58:16.800 --> 00:58:18.090\nDon't send it to a monitor.\n\n1051\n00:58:18.090 --> 00:58:21.784\nSend it out the serial port, so that we\ncan hook up with the serial cable and\n\n1052\n00:58:21.784 --> 00:58:24.720\ninteract that device when\nwe want to configure.\n\n1053\n00:58:24.720 --> 00:58:29.502\nSo, to do that,\nwe typically have to modify the grub\n\n1054\n00:58:29.502 --> 00:58:33.754\nconfiguration, and so I'm gonna edit that.\n\n1055\n00:58:33.754 --> 00:58:37.920\nAnd it is gonna depend on what\nchange it is you're trying to make.\n\n1056\n00:58:37.920 --> 00:58:40.680\nDifferent changes are gonna\nrequire different actions.\n\n1057\n00:58:40.680 --> 00:58:45.138\nBut basically you go in here and\nyou find your kernel line, and\n\n1058\n00:58:45.138 --> 00:58:51.254\nif you're just doing a little modification\nthen you can jump to the end of that line.\n\n1059\n00:58:51.254 --> 00:58:55.900\n[LAUGH] All right, VMWare is\nintercepting my keyboard shortcut.\n\n1060\n00:58:55.900 --> 00:58:58.504\nLet me get back in here.\n\n1061\n00:59:01.755 --> 00:59:02.660\nAll right.\n\n1062\n00:59:02.660 --> 00:59:04.540\nSo you can jump to\nthe end of that line and\n\n1063\n00:59:04.540 --> 00:59:08.050\nbasically add in whatever flags it is\nyou want to modify the boot process.\n\n1064\n00:59:08.050 --> 00:59:10.910\nOr maybe you need to modify\nsome of the existing ones.\n\n1065\n00:59:10.910 --> 00:59:13.430\nNormally I hit Ctrl+E and\njump to the end of the line, but\n\n1066\n00:59:13.430 --> 00:59:15.280\nVMware is killing my shortcuts.\n\n1067\n00:59:15.280 --> 00:59:16.830\nSo you can come through and\n\n1068\n00:59:16.830 --> 00:59:19.760\nadd whatever it is that you need to\ndo to modify this boot behavior.\n\n1069\n00:59:19.760 --> 00:59:23.510\nSo if I want to make this guy boot up and\n\n1070\n00:59:23.510 --> 00:59:27.210\nredirect the output to a serial port,\nI would add some flags to it.\n\n1071\n00:59:27.210 --> 00:59:32.990\nI would say, console=tty0,\nwhich would be my first serial port.\n\n1072\n00:59:32.990 --> 00:59:37.440\nIt'd be labeled COM1 on the device, so\nI'm saying that's gonna be my console.\n\n1073\n00:59:37.440 --> 00:59:43.340\nInstead of using a monitor as my console,\nI want you to use the first serial port.\n\n1074\n00:59:43.340 --> 00:59:47.541\nAll right, and\nthen we say console=ttys1, so\n\n1075\n00:59:47.541 --> 00:59:53.585\nthere's my serial port one, comma,\nand then we can specify a speed,\n\n1076\n00:59:53.585 --> 00:59:59.337\nso if I want to go Cisco-style,\nI could say 9600n8, right?\n\n1077\n00:59:59.337 --> 01:00:01.335\nNow, is gonna be set up as\nthe same way as a Cisco one,\n\n1078\n01:00:01.335 --> 01:00:04.254\nwe don't have to slow ourselves down\nlike that, you can go a little faster.\n\n1079\n01:00:04.254 --> 01:00:10.140\nMost people do 1912, you know,\n19.2 kilobytes per second.\n\n1080\n01:00:10.140 --> 01:00:14.270\nSo, I can set that and now when I reboot,\ninstead of displaying my stuff on screen,\n\n1081\n01:00:14.270 --> 01:00:16.640\nit'll display it out the serial port.\n\n1082\n01:00:16.640 --> 01:00:21.060\nAnd I'll need to take my laptop or another\ndevice and connect via serial port, and\n\n1083\n01:00:21.060 --> 01:00:24.360\nthen fire up a terminal program and I'll\nbe able to see the output of that device.\n\n1084\n01:00:24.360 --> 01:00:27.100\nNo monitor, no keyboard,\nI just bring in my laptop and\n\n1085\n01:00:27.100 --> 01:00:29.170\nI use that when I need it and that's it.\n\n1086\n01:00:29.170 --> 01:00:31.350\nAnd that's how my firewall is at home.\n\n1087\n01:00:31.350 --> 01:00:37.480\nIt has a web UI I can browse to and\nwork with, but if I wanna really\n\n1088\n01:00:37.480 --> 01:00:41.590\ndo something low level like update the OS,\nI need a console into it, so I plug in.\n\n1089\n01:00:41.590 --> 01:00:43.460\nThat way I don't have to drag\na monitor and keyboard and\n\n1090\n01:00:43.460 --> 01:00:46.248\nall that stuff into the little\ncloset where I have the firewall.\n\n1091\n01:00:46.248 --> 01:00:48.790\nI can take my laptop in there,\nhook right up, and there we go.\n\n1092\n01:00:48.790 --> 01:00:50.110\nSo pretty useful thing.\n\n1093\n01:00:50.110 --> 01:00:51.855\nAnd it's done with these kernel flags.\n\n1094\n01:00:51.855 --> 01:00:53.850\nRight, I can punch these in, and\n\n1095\n01:00:53.850 --> 01:00:56.540\nyou can do them manually at\nboot time in the grub menu.\n\n1096\n01:00:56.540 --> 01:00:59.230\nYou can press, on that menu where\nyou pick your operating system,\n\n1097\n01:00:59.230 --> 01:01:01.470\nyou can press E on\nthe keyboard to edit it.\n\n1098\n01:01:01.470 --> 01:01:05.360\nAnd you can do it inline right there and\nadd the flags at boot time if you want.\n\n1099\n01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:08.815\nOr here, they'll stay and\nthey'll be there every time, right.\n\n1100\n01:01:08.815 --> 01:01:12.450\nNow just going a little beyond\nwhat'll be in the exam.\n\n1101\n01:01:12.450 --> 01:01:13.730\nJust for your own knowledge,\n\n1102\n01:01:13.730 --> 01:01:16.030\nif you're gonna do this,\nthere are a few little problems.\n\n1103\n01:01:16.030 --> 01:01:20.120\nLike I've got a splash image, splash\nimages won't work over a serial port, so\n\n1104\n01:01:20.120 --> 01:01:21.010\nyou need to turn that off.\n\n1105\n01:01:21.010 --> 01:01:24.840\nI'll just stick a pound symbol at\nthe beginning to turn that line off.\n\n1106\n01:01:24.840 --> 01:01:30.158\nAnd then a couple other things\nlike after that hidden menu item\n\n1107\n01:01:30.158 --> 01:01:35.271\nwhich says don't display\nthe menu unless they press a key,\n\n1108\n01:01:35.271 --> 01:01:42.754\nI'll also add a few extra entries\nlike serial --unit=1 --speed=19200.\n\n1109\n01:01:42.754 --> 01:01:47.087\nOkay, that's telling it to use\nserial port 1 at a speed of 19.2 k.\n\n1110\n01:01:47.087 --> 01:01:50.532\nNow you might ask yourself, wait a minute,\nDon, didn't you just do that for\n\n1111\n01:01:50.532 --> 01:01:51.540\nthe kernel down here?\n\n1112\n01:01:51.540 --> 01:01:52.630\nAnd the answer is yes.\n\n1113\n01:01:52.630 --> 01:01:56.190\nAnd that's what I wanted to show you for\nthe exam, that's for the kernel.\n\n1114\n01:01:56.190 --> 01:01:58.690\nBut what about for grub itself?\n\n1115\n01:01:58.690 --> 01:02:01.590\nWhen grub boots, it's still gonna\nbe outputting to a monitor.\n\n1116\n01:02:01.590 --> 01:02:05.130\nSo, if I don't add this option right here,\nwhen grub boots,\n\n1117\n01:02:05.130 --> 01:02:07.090\nI won't be able to see\nit on the serial port.\n\n1118\n01:02:07.090 --> 01:02:11.190\nAnd it's not until the kernel loads\nthat I'll be able to see anything.\n\n1119\n01:02:11.190 --> 01:02:14.170\nSo, when I boot up the system I'll\nsee blank on the serial port,\n\n1120\n01:02:14.170 --> 01:02:16.870\nand then all of a sudden I'll\nsee the kernel load, okay.\n\n1121\n01:02:16.870 --> 01:02:21.170\nBut if I want to see grub, I need to\ntell grub to use that serial port also.\n\n1122\n01:02:21.170 --> 01:02:25.091\nAnd so it's that line and one more,\n\n1123\n01:02:25.091 --> 01:02:31.740\nterminal --timeout=8 console serial,\nall right.\n\n1124\n01:02:31.740 --> 01:02:35.710\nTelling it, again, to use the serial port\nfor the console connection and to have\n\n1125\n01:02:35.710 --> 01:02:41.110\na timeout which says, if I don't press\nanything for 8 minutes, just time out and\n\n1126\n01:02:41.110 --> 01:02:45.110\ndisconnect me, and that way I don't\nleave myself logged in on the system.\n\n1127\n01:02:45.110 --> 01:02:48.770\nJust a couple of other little flags\nthat you might choose to add.\n\n1128\n01:02:48.770 --> 01:02:50.220\nThose you probably won't see on the exam,\n\n1129\n01:02:50.220 --> 01:02:52.980\nmaybe, I mean those are just\nmodifications to grub.\n\n1130\n01:02:52.980 --> 01:02:54.620\nYou don't have to make those.\n\n1131\n01:02:54.620 --> 01:02:56.770\nIf we left them out,\nwe'd still see output,\n\n1132\n01:02:56.770 --> 01:02:58.350\nwe just wouldn't see the grub output.\n\n1133\n01:02:58.350 --> 01:03:01.460\nWe'd see it once it loaded the kernel.\n\n1134\n01:03:01.460 --> 01:03:06.980\nBut kernel flags like this are how we\nmodify the hardware interaction with\n\n1135\n01:03:08.200 --> 01:03:12.310\nthe kernel, when we have weird\nconfigurations, all right?\n\n1136\n01:03:12.310 --> 01:03:14.920\nYou might have a video card that's\njust not properly supported, so\n\n1137\n01:03:14.920 --> 01:03:17.260\nyou can override and\nsay that it's a VGA card or\n\n1138\n01:03:17.260 --> 01:03:22.272\nwhatever, you can do things like that\nright here through kernel flags.\n\n1139\n01:03:22.272 --> 01:03:24.186\nAll right, now if I were to stop here and\n\n1140\n01:03:24.186 --> 01:03:28.130\nreboot I wouldn't be able to see anything\nunless I connected with a serial port.\n\n1141\n01:03:28.130 --> 01:03:31.713\nAnd since it's a virtual machine,\nI don't wanna do that, but yeah,\n\n1142\n01:03:31.713 --> 01:03:34.482\nthat is something that I know\nI did on my own firewall.\n\n1143\n01:03:34.482 --> 01:03:38.420\nAll right, what else do we have here?\n\n1144\n01:03:38.420 --> 01:03:41.684\nSo that's an example of that,\nthere are few other things I'll\n\n1145\n01:03:41.684 --> 01:03:44.837\nput in the notes we don't need\nto cover them during the show.\n\n1146\n01:03:44.837 --> 01:03:47.949\nBut there's a few other things you\nmight need to do if you're gonna kinda\n\n1147\n01:03:47.949 --> 01:03:49.000\nrun this way.\n\n1148\n01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.010\nYou can manipulate the serial ports and\nstuff,\n\n1149\n01:03:51.010 --> 01:03:53.115\nthey have their own little\nconfiguration files.\n\n1150\n01:03:53.115 --> 01:03:57.087\nBut for the most part,\nthat should be about it.\n\n1151\n01:03:57.087 --> 01:03:59.695\nLet's talk about disabling hardware,\nall right.\n\n1152\n01:03:59.695 --> 01:04:03.875\nLet's say you've got some hardware in\nyour system and you don't want it.\n\n1153\n01:04:03.875 --> 01:04:05.902\nYou wanna shut it off or\nnot use it, whatever.\n\n1154\n01:04:05.902 --> 01:04:10.078\nWell, the easiest way to do it\nis to remove the module, right.\n\n1155\n01:04:10.078 --> 01:04:14.448\nSo I showed modprobe -r If you remove the\nmodule, you can still have the hardware\n\n1156\n01:04:14.448 --> 01:04:17.798\nin your system, but\nthe system is not going to use it, right.\n\n1157\n01:04:17.798 --> 01:04:19.249\nSo that'll help.\n\n1158\n01:04:19.249 --> 01:04:22.993\nThe only negative about removing\nthe module like if I do modprobe-r,\n\n1159\n01:04:22.993 --> 01:04:25.100\nwhat happens when I reboot?\n\n1160\n01:04:25.100 --> 01:04:29.225\nWhen I reboot, the module is back again,\nso that doesn't really save us.\n\n1161\n01:04:29.225 --> 01:04:32.135\nIf it was a module that\nwe installed ourselves,\n\n1162\n01:04:32.135 --> 01:04:35.535\nthen you could just remove the package and\nthen you don't have that problem.\n\n1163\n01:04:35.535 --> 01:04:37.285\nBut what if it's a core module?\n\n1164\n01:04:37.285 --> 01:04:40.275\nWhat if it's a module\nthat's a part of the OS and\n\n1165\n01:04:40.275 --> 01:04:44.915\nit's loaded every time and I want it\nout of there, I don't want to load it?\n\n1166\n01:04:44.915 --> 01:04:46.995\nWell modprobe won't work\ncuz it's temporary.\n\n1167\n01:04:46.995 --> 01:04:51.090\nSo we actually have a blacklist for\nmodprobe.\n\n1168\n01:04:51.090 --> 01:04:52.520\nAnd I wanna show that to you.\n\n1169\n01:04:52.520 --> 01:04:54.810\nLet me, I'm not gonna save this,\nget out of that.\n\n1170\n01:04:55.810 --> 01:04:59.280\nSo I wanna show you that blacklist, and in\nthe blacklist, what you can do is you can\n\n1171\n01:04:59.280 --> 01:05:03.030\nsay, even if you detect this hardware,\ndon't load this module.\n\n1172\n01:05:03.030 --> 01:05:05.210\nJust don't do it, keep it shut off,\n\n1173\n01:05:05.210 --> 01:05:07.850\nand that's a great way to prevent\nthat hardware from being used.\n\n1174\n01:05:07.850 --> 01:05:11.290\nSo if we go into /etc/modprobe.d, so\n\n1175\n01:05:11.290 --> 01:05:17.160\nthat's where the modprobe demon is and\nit's configuration files,\n\n1176\n01:05:17.160 --> 01:05:23.061\nyou'll see a configuration file\nin there called blacklist.conf.\n\n1177\n01:05:23.061 --> 01:05:27.730\nSo, that's /etc/modprobe.d, and\n\n1178\n01:05:27.730 --> 01:05:33.630\nthe file is blacklist.conf,\nand if I edit that,\n\n1179\n01:05:33.630 --> 01:05:37.200\nyou can see in here where they're\nblacklisting certain drivers.\n\n1180\n01:05:37.200 --> 01:05:39.860\nAll right, and there's already ones that\nare in here, ones that they blocked for\n\n1181\n01:05:39.860 --> 01:05:41.120\nvarious reason.\n\n1182\n01:05:41.120 --> 01:05:44.200\nEither they're no longer supported,\nthey're still included, but\n\n1183\n01:05:44.200 --> 01:05:45.100\nthey're no longer supported.\n\n1184\n01:05:45.100 --> 01:05:48.060\nAnd that means you have to manually\nturn it on if you choose to use it.\n\n1185\n01:05:48.060 --> 01:05:51.900\nYou're saying I accept the fact\nthat this is no longer supported,\n\n1186\n01:05:51.900 --> 01:05:53.500\nI'll turn it on, all right?\n\n1187\n01:05:53.500 --> 01:05:56.540\nBut you can add your own in here too.\n\n1188\n01:05:56.540 --> 01:06:00.520\nSo, those are some frame buffers\nthere which are video cards.\n\n1189\n01:06:00.520 --> 01:06:05.040\nISDN, God forbid you still have that,\nsome old sound card drivers and\n\n1190\n01:06:05.040 --> 01:06:06.550\nsome other stuff.\n\n1191\n01:06:06.550 --> 01:06:09.510\nThe order doesn't really matter, so if you\nwanna blacklist something you can just\n\n1192\n01:06:09.510 --> 01:06:11.140\nstick it wherever you want it in here.\n\n1193\n01:06:11.140 --> 01:06:14.450\nBut yeah, you can come in and\nadd something.\n\n1194\n01:06:14.450 --> 01:06:19.772\nSo I might come in and\nsay, Network adapters,\n\n1195\n01:06:19.772 --> 01:06:24.690\nand I can blacklist e1000, okay.\n\n1196\n01:06:26.730 --> 01:06:31.510\nSo now by adding it to the blacklist,\nwhen I reboot.\n\n1197\n01:06:31.510 --> 01:06:34.035\nIf I were to, all right, if I do ifconfig.\n\n1198\n01:06:34.035 --> 01:06:35.730\nRight.\n\n1199\n01:06:35.730 --> 01:06:38.770\nThere's that ETH0 right there,\nmy ethernet adapter.\n\n1200\n01:06:38.770 --> 01:06:44.246\nIt is using the E1000 module,\nand so if I do modprobe -r e1000,\n\n1201\n01:06:44.246 --> 01:06:48.060\nthat's gonna unload that module,\nremoves it.\n\n1202\n01:06:48.060 --> 01:06:52.900\nAnd if I do ifconfig,\nI can see ETH0 is now gone.\n\n1203\n01:06:52.900 --> 01:06:55.180\nRight? Right. So I lost it and\nI unloaded this module.\n\n1204\n01:06:55.180 --> 01:07:00.010\nIf I were to reboot that module\nwould come right back again, right?\n\n1205\n01:07:00.010 --> 01:07:05.670\nBut, because I added it to the blacklist\nit's gonna be gone and not load it.\n\n1206\n01:07:05.670 --> 01:07:06.270\nOkay?\n\n1207\n01:07:06.270 --> 01:07:12.040\nAnd so, that's one of the nice things If I\ndo a reboot, so here it goes rebooting.\n\n1208\n01:07:13.100 --> 01:07:14.394\nAnd it hopefully won't freak out on me.\n\n1209\n01:07:14.394 --> 01:07:15.760\nAnd, [LAUGH] so\n\n1210\n01:07:15.760 --> 01:07:19.550\nwhen it reboots, it'll come up, I didn't\nsay those serial port changes, did I?\n\n1211\n01:07:19.550 --> 01:07:20.740\n>> No.\n>> Okay, good.\n\n1212\n01:07:20.740 --> 01:07:26.050\nSo, [LAUGH] when it reboots,\nlet me just, I'll show this thing along.\n\n1213\n01:07:26.050 --> 01:07:27.760\nSo when it reboots it's gonna boot up.\n\n1214\n01:07:27.760 --> 01:07:29.670\nAnd that E1000 model is\ngonna see the hardware,\n\n1215\n01:07:29.670 --> 01:07:31.450\nit's gonna say I should load that module.\n\n1216\n01:07:31.450 --> 01:07:33.718\nIt'll look at the black list and\nit'll say, oop nevermind,\n\n1217\n01:07:33.718 --> 01:07:35.864\nit's in the black list,\nI'm not gonna load that module.\n\n1218\n01:07:37.572 --> 01:07:42.191\nAll right, so key thing to remember for\nthe exam is that modprobe/r or\n\n1219\n01:07:42.191 --> 01:07:45.020\nrm mod for that matter are temporary.\n\n1220\n01:07:45.020 --> 01:07:48.220\nWhen you reboot those\nmodules come back.Right..\n\n1221\n01:07:48.220 --> 01:07:54.060\nSo I do ifconfig,\nit did not load the E1000 adaptor or\n\n1222\n01:07:54.060 --> 01:07:58.698\nmodule and\nif I remove it from the blacklist,\n\n1223\n01:08:02.948 --> 01:08:06.560\nAnd you don't have to remove it, you can\nstick a, oops, that's not what I wanted.\n\n1224\n01:08:10.489 --> 01:08:11.430\nThere we go.\n\n1225\n01:08:11.430 --> 01:08:14.340\nYou can just put a hash mark before it and\nthat'll mark it out.\n\n1226\n01:08:15.550 --> 01:08:20.490\nAnd so now if I were to re-clear\nhardware or if I would just reboot.\n\n1227\n01:08:20.490 --> 01:08:24.490\nWhen it reboots it's gonna see that E1000,\nit's gonna recognize that it's there,\n\n1228\n01:08:24.490 --> 01:08:27.310\nit's gonna go to load the module,\nit's not in the blacklist, so\n\n1229\n01:08:27.310 --> 01:08:30.160\nit'll be happy about that and\nmy adapter should be back again.\n\n1230\n01:08:35.080 --> 01:08:40.200\nAll right, let's see I think that's about\nit for the old mod probe and modules.\n\n1231\n01:08:40.200 --> 01:08:40.700\n>> Yeah.\n\n1232\n01:08:43.160 --> 01:08:44.320\nYeah.\n>> A lot of stuff, but\n\n1233\n01:08:44.320 --> 01:08:45.040\nthat's basically it.\n\n1234\n01:08:45.040 --> 01:08:45.930\nI'm just gonna let this boot so\n\n1235\n01:08:45.930 --> 01:08:50.485\nwe can see the adapter does return,\nat least I hope it does.\n\n1236\n01:08:50.485 --> 01:08:52.364\n[LAUGH] A completely different\nproblem if it doesn't show up.\n\n1237\n01:08:56.115 --> 01:08:57.400\nThere it is, back again.\n\n1238\n01:08:57.400 --> 01:08:58.850\n>> Nice.\n>> All right, so blacklist,\n\n1239\n01:08:58.850 --> 01:09:00.980\neasy way to turn off hardware, all right?\n\n1240\n01:09:00.980 --> 01:09:03.210\nBe careful if you Google\nout on the internet,\n\n1241\n01:09:03.210 --> 01:09:06.680\nyou'll find a lot of people that give\ndifferent ways for disabling hardware.\n\n1242\n01:09:06.680 --> 01:09:08.640\nThe blacklist really\nis the best way to go.\n\n1243\n01:09:08.640 --> 01:09:12.200\nAnd that's because any software\nthat tries to load the module,\n\n1244\n01:09:12.200 --> 01:09:14.830\nit's gonna force it to\ncheck that blacklist.\n\n1245\n01:09:14.830 --> 01:09:17.760\nThere's other ways of disabling it too,\nlike kernel flags and\n\n1246\n01:09:17.760 --> 01:09:19.630\nstuff that don't always work.\n\n1247\n01:09:19.630 --> 01:09:21.390\nAnd don't trust your BIOS either.\n\n1248\n01:09:21.390 --> 01:09:22.660\nIf you disable hardware and\n\n1249\n01:09:22.660 --> 01:09:27.620\nBIOS, that'll make it where BIOS won't\nsee it, but oftentimes, Linux still can.\n\n1250\n01:09:27.620 --> 01:09:32.030\nIt's really bizarre cuz it does direct\ninteraction with the PCI buses and stuff.\n\n1251\n01:09:32.030 --> 01:09:35.316\nSo a lot of times it can find that\nhardware even though BIOS has it disabled,\n\n1252\n01:09:35.316 --> 01:09:37.365\nso the blacklist can be really handy for\nthat.\n\n1253\n01:09:39.906 --> 01:09:42.370\nAll right, so\ncouple other things to talk about.\n\n1254\n01:09:42.370 --> 01:09:46.570\nWhen we boot up, when we boot up,\na lot goes on in our system.\n\n1255\n01:09:46.570 --> 01:09:48.350\nWe go through boot process.\n\n1256\n01:09:48.350 --> 01:09:50.840\nAnd so I want to make sure that we\nhave a good understanding of what\n\n1257\n01:09:50.840 --> 01:09:53.360\nall is going on when we\nboot our computer up.\n\n1258\n01:09:53.360 --> 01:09:57.310\nWhen we reboot, you guys just saw it on\nmy screen, a bunch of stuff scrolled by.\n\n1259\n01:09:57.310 --> 01:10:00.360\nAnd the majority of that is\nvarious software starting up.\n\n1260\n01:10:00.360 --> 01:10:02.150\nSo a lot of it's just\nyour services running.\n\n1261\n01:10:02.150 --> 01:10:03.620\nAnd there's not much to see.\n\n1262\n01:10:03.620 --> 01:10:06.860\nBut hardware detection is\nhappening at boot time.\n\n1263\n01:10:06.860 --> 01:10:11.200\nIt's booting up, detecting all your\nhardware, loading the modules, and so on.\n\n1264\n01:10:11.200 --> 01:10:16.020\nSo, if you have a problem,\nhow do you know if there's an issue?\n\n1265\n01:10:16.020 --> 01:10:18.370\nWell, all that stuff at\nboot was great information,\n\n1266\n01:10:18.370 --> 01:10:19.890\nbut it's already off my screen.\n\n1267\n01:10:19.890 --> 01:10:22.122\nHow do I get it back?\n\n1268\n01:10:22.122 --> 01:10:27.120\nWell, there's several different pieces\nof logging and other activities\n\n1269\n01:10:27.120 --> 01:10:30.660\nthat are going on in the background\nthat allow us to see that information\n\n1270\n01:10:30.660 --> 01:10:34.540\neven after the fact, especially since\nit's changing thanks to USB adapters and\n\n1271\n01:10:34.540 --> 01:10:36.680\nstuff, anything that hot plugs.\n\n1272\n01:10:36.680 --> 01:10:39.760\nAs we're running it, it's generating\nmore of those log messages.\n\n1273\n01:10:39.760 --> 01:10:42.830\nSo when we boot up,\nthere's a lot of stuff going on, right.\n\n1274\n01:10:42.830 --> 01:10:45.406\nI already talked a little\nbit about boot flags right.\n\n1275\n01:10:45.406 --> 01:10:54.750\nSo if we take a loot at\n/boot/grub/grub.com, right.\n\n1276\n01:10:54.750 --> 01:10:57.990\nThese are all boot flags down here, so\n\n1277\n01:10:57.990 --> 01:11:02.900\nthat when my kernel loads, all this\nstuff modifies what's going on, okay.\n\n1278\n01:11:02.900 --> 01:11:05.650\nAnd I showed you guys the serial redirect,\nright.\n\n1279\n01:11:05.650 --> 01:11:07.170\nYou can also see root.\n\n1280\n01:11:07.170 --> 01:11:10.690\nWhere root is mapping where\nthat root drive is, all right.\n\n1281\n01:11:10.690 --> 01:11:14.170\nIf you change your hard drive and\nthe location root changes,\n\n1282\n01:11:14.170 --> 01:11:15.650\nyou might need to modify that.\n\n1283\n01:11:15.650 --> 01:11:19.320\nSame thing with the initial RAM drive,\nyou might need to change where it resides.\n\n1284\n01:11:19.320 --> 01:11:23.626\nSo, that stuff it's right here,\nthere's also other command flags and\n\n1285\n01:11:23.626 --> 01:11:25.672\nit does vary based on your kernel so\n\n1286\n01:11:25.672 --> 01:11:29.222\nyou may need to look up\nthe documentation that are in there.\n\n1287\n01:11:29.222 --> 01:11:33.220\nBut there's some neat one's like,\nI think I talked about the main ones.\n\n1288\n01:11:33.220 --> 01:11:37.860\nThere's max CPU where you can specify how\nmany processors you're allowed to us.\n\n1289\n01:11:37.860 --> 01:11:41.660\nSo you might have a quad core system but\nyou want to throttle this down to just\n\n1290\n01:11:41.660 --> 01:11:46.950\none CPU, maybe for testing or research,\nso you can say max CPU equals one.\n\n1291\n01:11:46.950 --> 01:11:50.600\nIt was plural,\nmax CPUs with an s equals one.\n\n1292\n01:11:51.820 --> 01:11:53.810\nThere's also an SC Linux, right.\n\n1293\n01:11:53.810 --> 01:11:56.970\nI ran into SC Linux earlier this week and\nhit a problem.\n\n1294\n01:11:56.970 --> 01:11:59.410\nYou can disable SC Linux\nwith a kernel flag,\n\n1295\n01:11:59.410 --> 01:12:02.180\nyou can say sc Linux=0 to turn it off.\n\n1296\n01:12:02.180 --> 01:12:04.570\nOr SC Linux equals one to leave it on.\n\n1297\n01:12:04.570 --> 01:12:07.989\nWe normally want it on, and we'll learn\nmore about that in the security episode.\n\n1298\n01:12:09.318 --> 01:12:13.868\nAll right, so there are a ton, and you\nsee a bunch that I've got here as far as\n\n1299\n01:12:13.868 --> 01:12:16.860\nidentifying like what\nkeyboard type I'm using,\n\n1300\n01:12:16.860 --> 01:12:21.150\nwhat keyboard table, so mine's set to US,\nwhere our Crash kernel is.\n\n1301\n01:12:21.150 --> 01:12:24.284\nIf we have a crash,\nwhere do we do our crash dump to.\n\n1302\n01:12:24.284 --> 01:12:27.690\nYou'll see all sorts of stuff\nlike that in here again.\n\n1303\n01:12:27.690 --> 01:12:33.026\nIn most of these we never have to modify,\nbut some are pretty useful.\n\n1304\n01:12:33.026 --> 01:12:37.537\nSo that's one way that I can interact with\nboot and start to manipulate things, but\n\n1305\n01:12:37.537 --> 01:12:40.710\nhow do I see what actually\nhappened during boot?\n\n1306\n01:12:40.710 --> 01:12:42.094\nBut when you boot the system up,\n\n1307\n01:12:42.094 --> 01:12:44.850\nthere's actually two log\nfiles that are being created.\n\n1308\n01:12:44.850 --> 01:12:51.146\nAnd they're both tucked away on\nyour hard drive in /var/log.\n\n1309\n01:12:51.146 --> 01:12:54.922\n/var/log is like a central repository for\nlog files on your system,\n\n1310\n01:12:54.922 --> 01:13:00.060\nand if you wanna see what happened when\nyou booted up, this is the place to go.\n\n1311\n01:13:00.060 --> 01:13:04.960\nNow, you'll likely have many logs in here,\nand yours might be different than mine,\n\n1312\n01:13:04.960 --> 01:13:07.010\nand it does vary from operating\nsystem to operating system.\n\n1313\n01:13:07.010 --> 01:13:13.560\nSo I'm running CentOS which is based on\nRed Hat which uses the Anaconda installer.\n\n1314\n01:13:13.560 --> 01:13:19.140\nSo when I install CentOS,\nit created all these Anaconda log files.\n\n1315\n01:13:19.140 --> 01:13:21.450\nSo I can see what happened\nduring installation, and\n\n1316\n01:13:21.450 --> 01:13:23.240\nif there was a problem during\nthe installation, I can find it.\n\n1317\n01:13:24.560 --> 01:13:27.700\nI'm also running sendmail,\nso I have a mail log.\n\n1318\n01:13:27.700 --> 01:13:31.670\nAnd I'm running a print spooler,\nso I've got spooler logs.\n\n1319\n01:13:31.670 --> 01:13:34.440\nYour system may or may not have those.\n\n1320\n01:13:34.440 --> 01:13:40.353\nBut two that you're pretty\nmuch guaranteed to have\n\n1321\n01:13:40.353 --> 01:13:45.537\nare dmesg, and the system log which is-\n>> Messages.\n\n1322\n01:13:45.537 --> 01:13:46.238\n>> Messages, there you go.\n\n1323\n01:13:46.238 --> 01:13:46.738\nThank you Ronnie.\n\n1324\n01:13:46.738 --> 01:13:49.520\n[LAUGH] So dmesg.\n\n1325\n01:13:49.520 --> 01:13:51.200\nThat's your boot up log.\n\n1326\n01:13:51.200 --> 01:13:52.330\nWhen you booted up and\n\n1327\n01:13:52.330 --> 01:13:57.370\nall your hardware detection happened,\nit logged that to dmesg.\n\n1328\n01:13:57.370 --> 01:14:01.660\nAnd then, everything else,\nall the software starting up, errors,\n\n1329\n01:14:01.660 --> 01:14:05.070\nanything that's happening during runtime,\nthat's all being logged to messages.\n\n1330\n01:14:06.090 --> 01:14:08.730\nThose are the two main log calls,\nwhen I come into this directory,\n\n1331\n01:14:08.730 --> 01:14:09.930\nthose are the two that I'm looking for.\n\n1332\n01:14:11.300 --> 01:14:13.560\nAnd so, we can look at them to\nfind out all sorts of information.\n\n1333\n01:14:13.560 --> 01:14:17.600\nAnd we can either just look right into\nthese files here, they're just text files.\n\n1334\n01:14:17.600 --> 01:14:21.980\nOr some of them actually have\na shortcut command like dmesg.\n\n1335\n01:14:21.980 --> 01:14:28.406\nSure, I could say more /var/log/dmesg, and\nI can pipe that into the more command,\n\n1336\n01:14:28.406 --> 01:14:33.960\nand here I can see everything that\nhappened during my last boot up.\n\n1337\n01:14:33.960 --> 01:14:38.346\nAnd so, I can go through and see all\nthe hardware detection that happened, and\n\n1338\n01:14:38.346 --> 01:14:39.554\nall that good stuff.\n\n1339\n01:14:39.554 --> 01:14:40.757\nSo that was just\n\n1340\n01:14:46.321 --> 01:14:50.210\nmore /var/log/dmesg_.\n\n1341\n01:14:50.210 --> 01:14:54.628\nBut there is a dmesg_ command that\nI can run, just flat out dmesg_.\n\n1342\n01:14:54.628 --> 01:14:58.940\nAnd when you run that, there you go,\nit just outputs that log file.\n\n1343\n01:14:58.940 --> 01:15:02.980\nSame thing, I'd probably wanna filter\nthat through the more command.\n\n1344\n01:15:02.980 --> 01:15:05.550\nAnd now it really is the same thing.\n\n1345\n01:15:05.550 --> 01:15:10.030\nSo that dmesg command is really just\nechoing the contents of this particular\n\n1346\n01:15:10.030 --> 01:15:11.150\nlog file to your screen.\n\n1347\n01:15:12.590 --> 01:15:16.730\nSo if I'm ever trying to figure out\nwhat happened with some hardware, so\n\n1348\n01:15:16.730 --> 01:15:21.180\nmaybe I've got that e1000 adapter and\nlike did it get detected did it not,\n\n1349\n01:15:21.180 --> 01:15:23.050\nwhat's the deal there?\n\n1350\n01:15:23.050 --> 01:15:25.380\nI can look in dmesg and see what happened.\n\n1351\n01:15:25.380 --> 01:15:27.288\nThe only problem with dmesg is just long.\n\n1352\n01:15:27.288 --> 01:15:29.100\nThere's a lot of data in there.\n\n1353\n01:15:29.100 --> 01:15:33.360\nSo I'll almost always use it combined\nwith either the less command so\n\n1354\n01:15:33.360 --> 01:15:38.150\nI can scroll through it, or with grep,\nthe grep so that I can query it and\n\n1355\n01:15:38.150 --> 01:15:39.510\nfind what I'm looking for.\n\n1356\n01:15:39.510 --> 01:15:43.500\nSo I could say, for example, dmesg,\nwhoops, which if I spell right,\n\n1357\n01:15:43.500 --> 01:15:44.090\nwill work better.\n\n1358\n01:15:45.300 --> 01:15:46.020\nThird time's a charm?\n\n1359\n01:15:46.020 --> 01:15:47.280\nThere we go.\n\n1360\n01:15:47.280 --> 01:15:51.230\nAnd I could pipe the output\nfrom that command into grep and\n\n1361\n01:15:51.230 --> 01:15:52.900\nI could look for e1000.\n\n1362\n01:15:54.500 --> 01:15:58.388\nAnd so, I'm saying give me every line from\nthe boot logs that includes e1000 and\n\n1363\n01:15:58.388 --> 01:16:00.840\nnow I can see what happened\nwith that adapter.\n\n1364\n01:16:00.840 --> 01:16:06.050\nIt found an Intel Pro 1000,\nhere's the PCI initialization.\n\n1365\n01:16:06.050 --> 01:16:11.200\nI can see that it was assigned eth0 so\nnow I know it's name and it's up.\n\n1366\n01:16:11.200 --> 01:16:16.030\nIt's got a 1 GB connection and\nthere we go.\n\n1367\n01:16:16.030 --> 01:16:20.918\nSo I can get information about\nthat hardware if I am curious\n\n1368\n01:16:20.918 --> 01:16:25.107\nabout my sound card,\nwe can search for SD-wait,\n\n1369\n01:16:25.107 --> 01:16:30.318\nmine is a AC 97,\napparently my sound card isn't detected.\n\n1370\n01:16:30.318 --> 01:16:32.240\nI did a server install.\n\n1371\n01:16:32.240 --> 01:16:34.980\nI might not have loaded\nany of the sound software.\n\n1372\n01:16:34.980 --> 01:16:37.080\nYou don't normally have\nspeakers hooked up to a server,\n\n1373\n01:16:37.080 --> 01:16:41.170\nso if I had done the desktop\ninstall that would likely turn up.\n\n1374\n01:16:41.170 --> 01:16:45.770\nIt's also case sensitive though, so maybe\nit's, no, so I must not have loaded it.\n\n1375\n01:16:45.770 --> 01:16:48.230\nBut you can go in and you can look,\nand you can find that information.\n\n1376\n01:16:48.230 --> 01:16:53.495\nIf I wanna find information about my hard\ndrive, so show me everything about SDA and\n\n1377\n01:16:53.495 --> 01:16:56.818\nso here I can see where SDA\nwas detected and mounted.\n\n1378\n01:16:56.818 --> 01:17:00.361\nI can see that I mounted it's ext4 and\n\n1379\n01:17:00.361 --> 01:17:05.065\nnow it's being used as in\npart of a volume group.\n\n1380\n01:17:05.065 --> 01:17:06.425\nSo I see the volume group name.\n\n1381\n01:17:06.425 --> 01:17:09.245\nWell, you'd see it if my head\nwasn't on it, there we go.\n\n1382\n01:17:09.245 --> 01:17:12.915\nSo you can start spot all\nthat dmesg is really useful.\n\n1383\n01:17:12.915 --> 01:17:15.685\nThe other thing that it does,\nwhen you look at dmesg,\n\n1384\n01:17:15.685 --> 01:17:17.965\nthat is your boot right now.\n\n1385\n01:17:17.965 --> 01:17:22.395\nNotice I also have dmesg.old,\nthat's from my previous boot.\n\n1386\n01:17:22.395 --> 01:17:25.125\nSo you actually have two copies of dmesg.\n\n1387\n01:17:25.125 --> 01:17:28.310\nNow, the dmesg command itself is\nshowing you the current one, but\n\n1388\n01:17:28.310 --> 01:17:29.950\nif you wanna see the old one,\nit's right there.\n\n1389\n01:17:29.950 --> 01:17:31.770\nSo you can actually see\nyour last two boots.\n\n1390\n01:17:34.338 --> 01:17:36.080\nMessages, on the other hand.\n\n1391\n01:17:36.080 --> 01:17:41.110\nMessages are really cool because\nit has all sorts of stuff.\n\n1392\n01:17:41.110 --> 01:17:46.720\nIf I take a look inside of messages\nI'm getting basically tons of events.\n\n1393\n01:17:46.720 --> 01:17:47.830\nWhat's happening on this server?\n\n1394\n01:17:47.830 --> 01:17:51.500\nI can see myself requesting\na DHCP address and getting one.\n\n1395\n01:17:51.500 --> 01:17:54.090\nI can see yum running in and\ndoing an update.\n\n1396\n01:17:54.090 --> 01:17:57.570\nI can see that when I connected to a TTY.\n\n1397\n01:17:57.570 --> 01:17:59.860\nOr where they got killed\noff cuz they idled.\n\n1398\n01:17:59.860 --> 01:18:04.530\nYou can see all sorts of really\ngood information right in here.\n\n1399\n01:18:04.530 --> 01:18:09.570\nThese messages are what are referred\nto as the syslog, or the system log.\n\n1400\n01:18:09.570 --> 01:18:14.050\nAnd anything that happens, good stuff,\nbad stuff, it all gets logged here.\n\n1401\n01:18:14.050 --> 01:18:18.420\nIf you're having errors or crashes, a lot\nof times it'll get logged right in here,\n\n1402\n01:18:18.420 --> 01:18:20.270\nand you can use this for troubleshooting.\n\n1403\n01:18:20.270 --> 01:18:22.836\nNow, this one can be huge.\n\n1404\n01:18:22.836 --> 01:18:27.410\nThe longer the system has been online,\nthe more stuff is going to be in here.\n\n1405\n01:18:27.410 --> 01:18:30.900\nSo it is a rare day that you will\njust browse through it like this.\n\n1406\n01:18:30.900 --> 01:18:35.830\nYou almost always use it\nin combination with grep\n\n1407\n01:18:35.830 --> 01:18:40.130\nto filter it or the less command where you\ncan then search for things and find them.\n\n1408\n01:18:41.135 --> 01:18:46.195\nSo if I were to do a,\nlet's do more./messages and\n\n1409\n01:18:46.195 --> 01:18:50.081\npipe that into grep and I'll search for\n\n1410\n01:18:50.081 --> 01:18:55.278\ne1000 and\nsee if network adapter events occur.\n\n1411\n01:18:55.278 --> 01:18:56.490\nSo here they come.\n\n1412\n01:18:56.490 --> 01:19:00.207\nI'll see a lot of the same stuff from\ndmesg in here, but I also see some other\n\n1413\n01:19:00.207 --> 01:19:03.874\nthings that might not have turned up and\nso, things from previous boots.\n\n1414\n01:19:03.874 --> 01:19:08.595\nCuz the syslog doesn't just wipe itself\nout, it's continues to grow until you\n\n1415\n01:19:08.595 --> 01:19:12.328\nwipe it out, but I can see the link\ncame up or the link goes down,\n\n1416\n01:19:12.328 --> 01:19:16.800\nyou can see that information in here and\nthis goes back more than one booth.\n\n1417\n01:19:16.800 --> 01:19:18.420\nThis goes back historically.\n\n1418\n01:19:18.420 --> 01:19:22.366\nNow, it will break itself up into\nfiles and you guys probably saw that.\n\n1419\n01:19:22.366 --> 01:19:27.224\nSee how I got messages and\nI got messages -20140623.\n\n1420\n01:19:27.224 --> 01:19:29.850\nJune 23rd, 2014.\n\n1421\n01:19:29.850 --> 01:19:32.990\nWell, as my messages file grows,\nif we just let it continue to grow,\n\n1422\n01:19:32.990 --> 01:19:34.360\nit would fill up the hard drive.\n\n1423\n01:19:34.360 --> 01:19:36.850\nSo it splits it off into additional files,\nand\n\n1424\n01:19:36.850 --> 01:19:40.970\nyou can configure that if you really\nwant to make it go back even further.\n\n1425\n01:19:40.970 --> 01:19:45.050\nBetter would be to use a syslog server\nsomewhere to store all that information so\n\n1426\n01:19:45.050 --> 01:19:46.780\nyou can go back years if you want.\n\n1427\n01:19:46.780 --> 01:19:48.470\nBut it stores it there.\n\n1428\n01:19:48.470 --> 01:19:51.028\nReally useful for troubleshooting.\n\n1429\n01:19:51.028 --> 01:19:55.376\nRemember the tail command,\nthat's a pretty handy one,\n\n1430\n01:19:55.376 --> 01:20:00.459\nif a program just crashed you\ncan run tail/var/log/messages.\n\n1431\n01:20:01.740 --> 01:20:04.170\nAnd that will show you the last ten lines.\n\n1432\n01:20:04.170 --> 01:20:07.983\nAnd if the software just crashed, it will\nbe right there in the last ten lines, so\n\n1433\n01:20:07.983 --> 01:20:11.702\ntail can let you jump in and see what that\nerror was if you had some kind of crash.\n\n1434\n01:20:11.702 --> 01:20:15.034\nI haven't had a crash, but\nif I had, it would be here.\n\n1435\n01:20:15.034 --> 01:20:19.187\nSo that is the message log,\nreally, really handy and\n\n1436\n01:20:19.187 --> 01:20:22.432\na great place to go for troubleshooting.\n\n1437\n01:20:22.432 --> 01:20:27.550\nAll right, for the most part, the boot\ndoesn't need a lot of troubleshooting.\n\n1438\n01:20:27.550 --> 01:20:32.600\nOnce it's set up, Linux, I mean, it's a\nworld different than it was 20 years ago.\n\n1439\n01:20:32.600 --> 01:20:36.405\n20 years ago, it took a lot of work to get\nyour system booting, and up and running,\n\n1440\n01:20:36.405 --> 01:20:38.349\nand happy with all your hardware working.\n\n1441\n01:20:38.349 --> 01:20:43.054\nToday, driver support in Linux has\nbecome so robust that most people\n\n1442\n01:20:43.054 --> 01:20:47.931\ndo the GUI install from their DVD and\nthen that's it, things run fine.\n\n1443\n01:20:47.931 --> 01:20:51.848\nBut, what I wanna do is, I wanna walk\nyou guys through that boot process and\n\n1444\n01:20:51.848 --> 01:20:55.690\nwhat happens each step along the way and\ngive us a chance to see that.\n\n1445\n01:20:55.690 --> 01:20:59.330\nAnd just kinda understand the concepts,\nso that when a problem does happen,\n\n1446\n01:20:59.330 --> 01:21:02.650\nwe kind of know where we need to be\nlooking to troubleshoot, all right.\n\n1447\n01:21:02.650 --> 01:21:04.750\nBut, looking at the clock,\nI've kinda run us past time.\n\n1448\n01:21:04.750 --> 01:21:08.290\nSo, let's do this, let's stop and taka\na break, and when we get back we're gonna\n\n1449\n01:21:08.290 --> 01:21:12.770\nsee that boot process, everything that we\ngo through, and continue on from there.\n\n1450\n01:21:12.770 --> 01:21:15.768\nSo stay tuned, we'll be back in a few.\n\n1451\n01:21:15.768 --> 01:21:21.974\n[MUSIC]\n\n1452\n01:21:21.974 --> 01:21:23.968\nAll right, welcome back everybody.\n\n1453\n01:21:23.968 --> 01:21:27.402\nSo we wanna take a minute to focus\non the boot process with Linux for\n\n1454\n01:21:27.402 --> 01:21:31.835\nthe most part it's very similar to other\noperating systems because the boot process\n\n1455\n01:21:31.835 --> 01:21:34.516\ntypically happens-\n>> Well, before the operating system.\n\n1456\n01:21:34.516 --> 01:21:35.111\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n1457\n01:21:35.111 --> 01:21:39.500\n[LAUGH] So, the operating systems only\nhave so much they can do to change it.\n\n1458\n01:21:39.500 --> 01:21:43.590\nSo, there's really four major\nsteps to the boot up process\n\n1459\n01:21:43.590 --> 01:21:45.840\nwhen you're running a Linux distribution.\n\n1460\n01:21:45.840 --> 01:21:49.380\nStep one is what happens immediately\nafter you press the power button\n\n1461\n01:21:49.380 --> 01:21:50.550\non your computer.\n\n1462\n01:21:50.550 --> 01:21:52.650\nWhich on the motherboard of your computer.\n\n1463\n01:21:52.650 --> 01:21:53.560\nYou have a BIOS chip.\n\n1464\n01:21:53.560 --> 01:21:58.932\nBIOS is the basic input output system and\nit turns on, right.\n\n1465\n01:21:58.932 --> 01:22:02.270\nSo [LAUGH] you push that power button and\nthat's the BIOS main job.\n\n1466\n01:22:02.270 --> 01:22:05.850\nIs to check the hardware in\nyour system Initialize it,\n\n1467\n01:22:05.850 --> 01:22:09.930\napply power where it's needed,\npowers up the CPU, powers up the RAM,\n\n1468\n01:22:09.930 --> 01:22:12.950\ncopies itself into RAM,\nmost BIOS chips do that these days.\n\n1469\n01:22:14.190 --> 01:22:15.750\nAnd then get ready to boot your system.\n\n1470\n01:22:15.750 --> 01:22:21.360\nNow, in the old days, the BIOS chip would\nthen look for your primary hard drive,\n\n1471\n01:22:21.360 --> 01:22:25.890\nand it would reach out to the master boot\nrecord to find a boot loader, right?\n\n1472\n01:22:25.890 --> 01:22:28.710\nBut in today's world,\nthere's actually one of two possibilities.\n\n1473\n01:22:28.710 --> 01:22:30.000\nOne, the old thing might happen.\n\n1474\n01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:33.860\nIt might look to your primary boot disk\nand try and find the master boot record.\n\n1475\n01:22:33.860 --> 01:22:36.941\nOr two, it might look for\na new EFI Partition,\n\n1476\n01:22:36.941 --> 01:22:40.101\nso UEFI,\ndo you remember what UEFI stands for?\n\n1477\n01:22:40.101 --> 01:22:42.810\nExtensible-\n>> Unified Extensible Firmware Interface.\n\n1478\n01:22:42.810 --> 01:22:43.391\n>> There we go, thank you.\n\n1479\n01:22:43.391 --> 01:22:44.962\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I knew it was\n\n1480\n01:22:44.962 --> 01:22:47.200\nUnified Extensible something.\n\n1481\n01:22:47.200 --> 01:22:53.280\nUEFI is a newer boot loader system\nthat a lot of Linux machines have not\n\n1482\n01:22:53.280 --> 01:22:58.030\njumped on right off because of some issues\nwith secure boot and stuff like that.\n\n1483\n01:22:58.030 --> 01:23:02.470\nBut it is becoming very popular, and your\nmajor distributions like Red Hats, CentOS,\n\n1484\n01:23:02.470 --> 01:23:06.660\nand Ubuntu all support it so,\nit's not like you can't use it.\n\n1485\n01:23:06.660 --> 01:23:11.060\nIf you have a UNIF enabled system, Once\nyour BIOS boots up, instead of looking for\n\n1486\n01:23:11.060 --> 01:23:14.260\na master boot record it looks for\nUEFI to kick in.\n\n1487\n01:23:14.260 --> 01:23:17.690\nAnd UEFI will basically reside on a,\n\n1488\n01:23:17.690 --> 01:23:21.410\nusually a 200 to 300 megabyte partition\non your hard drive somewhere, and\n\n1489\n01:23:21.410 --> 01:23:24.680\nit'll fire that up and\nthen find the operating system from there.\n\n1490\n01:23:24.680 --> 01:23:25.500\nAll right.\n\n1491\n01:23:25.500 --> 01:23:27.630\nWhether it's UEFI or BIOS though,\n\n1492\n01:23:27.630 --> 01:23:30.050\nthe only difference is whether it's\nlooking to the master boot record or\n\n1493\n01:23:30.050 --> 01:23:33.530\nwhether it's It's looking for\na UEFI capable of partition.\n\n1494\n01:23:33.530 --> 01:23:34.700\nOnce it finds it though,\n\n1495\n01:23:34.700 --> 01:23:39.280\neither one of them is gonna launch\nwhat's called a micro boot loader.\n\n1496\n01:23:39.280 --> 01:23:41.400\nBoot loaders are actually made\nup of two pieces, all right?\n\n1497\n01:23:41.400 --> 01:23:45.490\nA lot of people don't realize this,\ncuz it's kind of invisible to us, but\n\n1498\n01:23:45.490 --> 01:23:48.370\nthe first piece is incredibly small.\n\n1499\n01:23:48.370 --> 01:23:51.480\nIncredibly small because it has\nto fit in the master boot record.\n\n1500\n01:23:51.480 --> 01:23:53.760\nIt's gotta fit in the MBR of a hard drive.\n\n1501\n01:23:53.760 --> 01:23:58.040\nAnd usually is a program that is so\nsmall it only has one function, and\n\n1502\n01:23:58.040 --> 01:24:01.480\nthat is to go and\nfind the real program and run it.\n\n1503\n01:24:01.480 --> 01:24:04.730\nAnd you might have noticed\nhow a lot of our grub stuff,\n\n1504\n01:24:04.730 --> 01:24:09.440\nour grub configuration on that\nwas in /boot/grub, right?\n\n1505\n01:24:09.440 --> 01:24:11.150\nThat was that folder that it was in.\n\n1506\n01:24:11.150 --> 01:24:14.180\nWell, if that's in a folder\non our hard drive, and\n\n1507\n01:24:14.180 --> 01:24:18.500\nwe're just jumping over from bios,\nthat folder's not mounted, is it?\n\n1508\n01:24:18.500 --> 01:24:19.250\nNo.\n\n1509\n01:24:19.250 --> 01:24:23.280\nSo, when it reaches into the MBR and\nit grabs that micro boot looker or\n\n1510\n01:24:23.280 --> 01:24:28.020\nreaches into UEFI, it goes into UEFI\nboot process, when that happens,\n\n1511\n01:24:28.020 --> 01:24:32.730\nthat little micro boot loader has\nenough in it to be able to mount.\n\n1512\n01:24:32.730 --> 01:24:34.640\nThe root partition, and\n\n1513\n01:24:34.640 --> 01:24:39.790\nthen to be able to launch the full GRUB,\nor whatever our bootloader is, from there.\n\n1514\n01:24:39.790 --> 01:24:44.430\nSo the micro bootloader for GRUB can\nactually mount ext partitions, ext2, 3, 4,\n\n1515\n01:24:44.430 --> 01:24:48.960\nwhatever, and be able to jump in there,\nget the full GRUB and\n\n1516\n01:24:48.960 --> 01:24:50.560\nthen boot from that, all right?\n\n1517\n01:24:50.560 --> 01:24:55.080\nNow that process happens very\nquickly with no screen output.\n\n1518\n01:24:55.080 --> 01:24:57.080\nSo, if you're just watching,\nyou don't see that.\n\n1519\n01:24:57.080 --> 01:24:59.470\nYou don't see the micro\nboot loader do its job.\n\n1520\n01:24:59.470 --> 01:25:02.530\nWhat you see, is the full boot loader,\nwhich is step three.\n\n1521\n01:25:02.530 --> 01:25:06.140\nSo we went from BIOS,\ndown to the micro boot loader,\n\n1522\n01:25:06.140 --> 01:25:08.200\nthen we go to the full boot loader.\n\n1523\n01:25:08.200 --> 01:25:10.100\nNow the full boot loader,\nit's got its configuration.\n\n1524\n01:25:10.100 --> 01:25:12.100\nSo it's normally gonna be grub.\n\n1525\n01:25:12.100 --> 01:25:15.500\nAnd so it's got this grub.com\nfile that has the configuration.\n\n1526\n01:25:15.500 --> 01:25:18.210\nAnd it can look and\nsee the various operating systems.\n\n1527\n01:25:18.210 --> 01:25:21.590\nAnd when it lists the operating systems\nit's got information in there like\n\n1528\n01:25:21.590 --> 01:25:24.520\nwhere the kernel is, where the initial\nRAM disk is and stuff like that.\n\n1529\n01:25:24.520 --> 01:25:27.310\nIt's got the basic stuff we need\nto be able to boot the system.\n\n1530\n01:25:27.310 --> 01:25:29.360\nWe pick which one we want.\n\n1531\n01:25:29.360 --> 01:25:34.400\nAnd then, it reaches out and transfers of\npower over to the operating system and\n\n1532\n01:25:34.400 --> 01:25:37.040\nthe operating systems starts to boot and\ndo a thing.\n\n1533\n01:25:37.040 --> 01:25:39.460\nThat's the fourth steps\nof the boot process.\n\n1534\n01:25:39.460 --> 01:25:40.766\nRight?\nSo just reviewing that again.\n\n1535\n01:25:40.766 --> 01:25:45.121\nWe got BIOS, to the micro boot loader,\nto the full boot loader,\n\n1536\n01:25:45.121 --> 01:25:47.391\nto our actual operating system.\n\n1537\n01:25:47.391 --> 01:25:50.230\nNow you might be wondering why\nI'm holding up five fingers and\n\n1538\n01:25:50.230 --> 01:25:51.820\nthe true reason is accidentally.\n\n1539\n01:25:51.820 --> 01:25:54.490\nBut I'm gonna play it off with\na good one here in which case\n\n1540\n01:25:54.490 --> 01:25:56.170\nif Grub is calling Windows,\n\n1541\n01:25:56.170 --> 01:26:00.350\nright, we might go from the microboot\nloader which I guess was this finger.\n\n1542\n01:26:00.350 --> 01:26:01.530\nI'm loosing, whatever.\n\n1543\n01:26:01.530 --> 01:26:05.900\nSo we go from BIOS, to the micro boot\nloader, to the full boot loader,\n\n1544\n01:26:05.900 --> 01:26:09.500\nwhich then chain loads the Windows\nboot loader, and then loads Windows.\n\n1545\n01:26:09.500 --> 01:26:13.280\nSo you might have five steps in there,\nor, you could hold up four fingers like I\n\n1546\n01:26:13.280 --> 01:26:16.560\nmeant to in the first place, and\nthen you, you just have the four.\n\n1547\n01:26:16.560 --> 01:26:19.350\nSo, either way, that's kind of\nthe boot process that we go through.\n\n1548\n01:26:19.350 --> 01:26:22.390\nIf any of those are broken,\nobviously that can cause some problems.\n\n1549\n01:26:22.390 --> 01:26:24.915\nWell, Grub we saw,\nis pretty easy to reinstall,\n\n1550\n01:26:24.915 --> 01:26:29.150\ngrub-install will take care of that, and\nyou can even boot from a live cda and\n\n1551\n01:26:29.150 --> 01:26:31.540\ninstall it that way,\nput it back on your hard drive.\n\n1552\n01:26:31.540 --> 01:26:33.600\nWe covered that in the boot loader show.\n\n1553\n01:26:33.600 --> 01:26:35.890\nBut that's the basic boot or the process.\n\n1554\n01:26:35.890 --> 01:26:41.090\nNow, will it transfers over to the os and\nknows where the Coronel is and\n\n1555\n01:26:41.090 --> 01:26:42.780\nit goes to fire that up.\n\n1556\n01:26:42.780 --> 01:26:43.980\nWhat happens after that?\n\n1557\n01:26:43.980 --> 01:26:46.890\nWell, technically, grub has done it's job.\n\n1558\n01:26:46.890 --> 01:26:47.430\nIt's done.\n\n1559\n01:26:47.430 --> 01:26:48.370\nIt walks away.\n\n1560\n01:26:48.370 --> 01:26:49.040\nRight?\n\n1561\n01:26:49.040 --> 01:26:51.720\nBut your os is kicking you now.\n\n1562\n01:26:52.740 --> 01:26:54.490\nIn the Grub configuration,\nwe saw where the kernel is.\n\n1563\n01:26:54.490 --> 01:26:58.300\nLet me bring that back up on my machine\nI keep talking about that stuff.\n\n1564\n01:26:58.300 --> 01:27:00.665\nLet me get into /boot/grub.\n\n1565\n01:27:01.940 --> 01:27:04.940\nAnd I'll do a more grub.com.\n\n1566\n01:27:04.940 --> 01:27:11.510\nOkay, so,\nif I look at my operating system, right.\n\n1567\n01:27:11.510 --> 01:27:14.910\nSo, here's my operating system cent OS.\n\n1568\n01:27:14.910 --> 01:27:18.370\nThe root is hd0,\nthe first hard drive in my system.\n\n1569\n01:27:18.370 --> 01:27:23.601\nHere's the kernel, vmlinuz-2.6.32 blah,\nblah, blah, right.\n\n1570\n01:27:23.601 --> 01:27:25.520\nAnd then here's my initial RAM drive.\n\n1571\n01:27:25.520 --> 01:27:27.340\nNow, I've mentioned that a few time,\n\n1572\n01:27:27.340 --> 01:27:29.440\nlet me just make sure you\nguys understand what that is.\n\n1573\n01:27:29.440 --> 01:27:33.030\nThe initial RAM drive is, it's a file,\nit's not a very big file.\n\n1574\n01:27:33.030 --> 01:27:36.710\nAnd, it contains a subset of utilities,\ntools,\n\n1575\n01:27:36.710 --> 01:27:38.900\nthings the operating system needs to work.\n\n1576\n01:27:38.900 --> 01:27:43.550\nAnd so, when you first fire up your OS, it\nmight not be ready to mount all your other\n\n1577\n01:27:43.550 --> 01:27:46.610\nhard drives yet, because you might\nhave crazy things like LVMs, right,\n\n1578\n01:27:46.610 --> 01:27:48.550\nlogical volume manager stuff in place.\n\n1579\n01:27:48.550 --> 01:27:52.010\nYou might have software raid,\nyou might have all sorts of crazy things.\n\n1580\n01:27:52.010 --> 01:27:54.685\nAnd the kernel itself is\nnot ready to handle that.\n\n1581\n01:27:54.685 --> 01:27:59.547\nWel, the initial ram disk, this initrd,\nit's a file that's been copied into\n\n1582\n01:27:59.547 --> 01:28:02.812\nRAM and creates like a virtual\nhard drive in your RAM,\n\n1583\n01:28:02.812 --> 01:28:07.769\nand it contains the tools necessary to\naccess higher level functions for the OS.\n\n1584\n01:28:07.769 --> 01:28:12.919\nOnce it's got that in place now it's ready\nto kick in full tilt and launch the full\n\n1585\n01:28:12.919 --> 01:28:17.870\nblown operating system environment,\nall the other stuff that ties into it.\n\n1586\n01:28:17.870 --> 01:28:21.214\nOkay, well, in Grub,\nwe don't have all the other stuff listed,\n\n1587\n01:28:21.214 --> 01:28:24.405\nwe just have the kernel and\nthe initial RAM disk and that's it.\n\n1588\n01:28:24.405 --> 01:28:28.063\nWhere's the rest come from?\n\n1589\n01:28:28.063 --> 01:28:31.630\nWell, this used to be an easy answer.\n\n1590\n01:28:31.630 --> 01:28:33.630\nWell, it comes from the init system.\n\n1591\n01:28:33.630 --> 01:28:34.700\nIt comes from init, and\n\n1592\n01:28:34.700 --> 01:28:38.740\nthat's where it all knows what to boot up,\nbut things are never that easy.\n\n1593\n01:28:41.010 --> 01:28:43.870\nOn the exam, it's probably gonna\nbe pretty straightforward,\n\n1594\n01:28:43.870 --> 01:28:47.570\nthere's gonna be the init system,\nand that's about it.\n\n1595\n01:28:47.570 --> 01:28:52.480\nBut, in real life land, there's actually\nsome debate and some change that's\n\n1596\n01:28:52.480 --> 01:28:56.734\ngoing on right now, and so you're\ngonna see some variation, all right?\n\n1597\n01:28:56.734 --> 01:29:01.930\nIn Redhat, the startup process,\n\n1598\n01:29:01.930 --> 01:29:04.950\nwell, there's a couple of variations,\nso we've got\n\n1599\n01:29:06.840 --> 01:29:11.510\nthe old init process,\nand it's being replaced.\n\n1600\n01:29:11.510 --> 01:29:17.049\nRedhat and a couple of other companies are\nstarting to go with a replacement called,\n\n1601\n01:29:17.049 --> 01:29:17.758\nSystem D.\n\n1602\n01:29:17.758 --> 01:29:22.396\nSystem D is, hang on, I want to make sure\nI'm not mixing it up cuz the other one is\n\n1603\n01:29:22.396 --> 01:29:24.429\nUpstart, and Upstart is Ubuntu.\n\n1604\n01:29:24.429 --> 01:29:27.068\nUbuntu is pushing Upstart, and\nRed Hat is pushing System D,\n\n1605\n01:29:27.068 --> 01:29:30.240\nunless I'm mixing these up, so\nwe're starting to see some variation.\n\n1606\n01:29:30.240 --> 01:29:34.910\nNow System D is back where it's\ncompatible with init, and so\n\n1607\n01:29:34.910 --> 01:29:40.280\nthat's kinda the same for us, and\nUpstart is a new initialization system.\n\n1608\n01:29:40.280 --> 01:29:43.140\nThey all do the same thing, they just do\nit a slightly different way, and so we're\n\n1609\n01:29:43.140 --> 01:29:46.830\nstarting to see different distributions\ngoing different routes on this.\n\n1610\n01:29:46.830 --> 01:29:50.980\nThey're all trying to maintain backwards\ncompatibility, so on the exam you're\n\n1611\n01:29:50.980 --> 01:29:54.110\nreally gonna see the old way,\nyou're not gonna see these new ones, and\n\n1612\n01:29:54.110 --> 01:29:58.620\nyou'll see where even Ubuntu in Red Hat,\na lot of their changes.\n\n1613\n01:29:58.620 --> 01:30:01.390\nThey're still pushing them out in\ntheir beta, they're non-stable forks,\n\n1614\n01:30:01.390 --> 01:30:03.770\nthey're not actually pushing it\nin the production system yet.\n\n1615\n01:30:03.770 --> 01:30:06.504\nSo, I'm gonna show you guys\nthe initialization with,\n\n1616\n01:30:06.504 --> 01:30:09.538\nit is pretty much what you're\ngonna see in production today.\n\n1617\n01:30:09.538 --> 01:30:12.277\nBut just know, if you watch this\nvideo two years from now, so\n\n1618\n01:30:12.277 --> 01:30:16.178\nif you're watching this in 2016,\nthen you might say, Don, that's not right.\n\n1619\n01:30:16.178 --> 01:30:19.598\nWe don't use init anymore,\nnow we use Upstart or we use System D.\n\n1620\n01:30:19.598 --> 01:30:23.514\nWell, there's a battle going on right now,\nand it's like VHS versus Betamax, and\n\n1621\n01:30:23.514 --> 01:30:27.280\nso I don't really know which one we're\ngoing to have two years from now.\n\n1622\n01:30:27.280 --> 01:30:34.100\nI'll gamble it's going to be System D,\nbut it has yet to be seen.\n\n1623\n01:30:34.100 --> 01:30:38.400\nThere are some variations, some things\nthat you might see as you start deploying\n\n1624\n01:30:38.400 --> 01:30:40.970\nsome of the newer distributions\nthat are out there, all right?\n\n1625\n01:30:40.970 --> 01:30:45.188\nBut normally, we're dealing with the init\nsystem, and the init system's pretty cool,\n\n1626\n01:30:45.188 --> 01:30:46.868\nit's right here on our hard drive.\n\n1627\n01:30:46.868 --> 01:30:52.919\nIf you browse into cd /sbin,\nwhich are system binaries,\n\n1628\n01:30:52.919 --> 01:30:56.747\nand you kinda take a gander in there,\n\n1629\n01:30:56.747 --> 01:31:01.578\nyou will find buried in\nthere somewhere init.\n\n1630\n01:31:01.578 --> 01:31:04.410\nThat guy right there,\nthat one little innocuous file.\n\n1631\n01:31:04.410 --> 01:31:09.370\nThat's the initialization program and\nthe operating system will call it, and\n\n1632\n01:31:09.370 --> 01:31:15.440\nit in turn will launch all the other\nthings our system depends on.\n\n1633\n01:31:15.440 --> 01:31:18.680\nSo while it's a little innocuous file,\nit is very, very powerful,\n\n1634\n01:31:18.680 --> 01:31:22.760\nbecause it's controlling all of the other\napplications that run on our system.\n\n1635\n01:31:22.760 --> 01:31:28.480\nSo that's a lot, that's a lot of stuff to\nhave right there on one little system.\n\n1636\n01:31:28.480 --> 01:31:32.050\nNow when it runs,\nhow does init know what to launch?\n\n1637\n01:31:32.050 --> 01:31:35.260\nWell, we have a bunch of\nconfiguration files, or they're\n\n1638\n01:31:35.260 --> 01:31:39.910\nreally called launch scripts So there are\nthese scripts that tell it what to do and\n\n1639\n01:31:39.910 --> 01:31:44.810\nyou can see these if you take\na look in your etc folder, alright.\n\n1640\n01:31:44.810 --> 01:31:49.841\nInside of etc,\nthere is a folder called rc.d, and\n\n1641\n01:31:49.841 --> 01:31:57.218\nrc.d contains the various scripts that\nlaunch when our system starts up.\n\n1642\n01:32:00.558 --> 01:32:03.040\nLet me just take the color off there,\nokay?\n\n1643\n01:32:03.040 --> 01:32:08.040\nSo, when you look in here,\nyou'll see rc, rc.local, rc.sysnet.\n\n1644\n01:32:08.040 --> 01:32:10.370\nOkay, system initialization, right?\n\n1645\n01:32:10.370 --> 01:32:15.320\nThat's when we boot up,\nthese folders are packed full of scripts.\n\n1646\n01:32:15.320 --> 01:32:18.950\nLittle bash command scripts that run\n\n1647\n01:32:18.950 --> 01:32:22.970\nthat in turn will launch all the various\nservices and applications on our system.\n\n1648\n01:32:22.970 --> 01:32:26.560\nNow you'll see rc0.d through rc6.d\n\n1649\n01:32:26.560 --> 01:32:28.810\nI'm going to talk about\nthose in just a minute.\n\n1650\n01:32:28.810 --> 01:32:33.010\nBut, put those out of your mind and\nyou'll see in nit.d which is a directory,\n\n1651\n01:32:33.010 --> 01:32:37.768\nyou've got rc which is a folder, rc.local\nand I mean, not a folder but a file.\n\n1652\n01:32:37.768 --> 01:32:46.530\nrc.local and rc.sysnet and\nif we take a look at rc.sysini,\n\n1653\n01:32:46.530 --> 01:32:51.580\nit is a bash script, and we're gonna talk\nmore about scripting in another episode.\n\n1654\n01:32:51.580 --> 01:32:53.240\nBut basically it's going through and\n\n1655\n01:32:53.240 --> 01:32:55.980\nit's doing all the things that happen\nEven when our system boots up.\n\n1656\n01:32:55.980 --> 01:32:59.080\nLook, just right here\nfrom the top: host name.\n\n1657\n01:32:59.080 --> 01:33:01.380\nSo it's setting the host\nname of our computer and\n\n1658\n01:33:01.380 --> 01:33:05.220\nthen notice that it's mounting proc and\nnow it's mounting syst.\n\n1659\n01:33:05.220 --> 01:33:07.100\nThose are pretty important folders, right?\n\n1660\n01:33:07.100 --> 01:33:10.540\nWe talked about that in the previous\nsegment So, really important.\n\n1661\n01:33:10.540 --> 01:33:16.110\nThen, mod probe USB core, it's querying\nfor USB devices and attaching them.\n\n1662\n01:33:16.110 --> 01:33:19.880\nSo you'll see this going through and\ndoing all the things\n\n1663\n01:33:19.880 --> 01:33:23.340\nthat are super important for our system to\nfunction the way that it's supposed to.\n\n1664\n01:33:23.340 --> 01:33:24.820\nThere it's turning on SE Linux.\n\n1665\n01:33:24.820 --> 01:33:30.280\nSo, that security sub layer, you know,\njust playing it to the warnings.\n\n1666\n01:33:30.280 --> 01:33:32.840\nLooks like we got some autorelabel stuff.\n\n1667\n01:33:32.840 --> 01:33:34.620\nThat's sc Linux again.\n\n1668\n01:33:34.620 --> 01:33:36.170\nLet's see.\n\n1669\n01:33:36.170 --> 01:33:36.950\nWhat do we have here.\n\n1670\n01:33:36.950 --> 01:33:40.130\nWelcome to Red Hat, Fedora, CentOS.\n\n1671\n01:33:40.130 --> 01:33:41.220\nRight.\nSo, the different welcome to.\n\n1672\n01:33:41.220 --> 01:33:43.440\nYour operating system message\nthat you see when you log in.\n\n1673\n01:33:43.440 --> 01:33:47.940\nHere is initializing\nsome current module And\n\n1674\n01:33:47.940 --> 01:33:49.588\njust giving you a warning if they fail.\n\n1675\n01:33:49.588 --> 01:33:51.620\nI'm only 20% the way through this thing.\n\n1676\n01:33:51.620 --> 01:33:53.950\nI don't know if I wanna go\nthrough the whole thing.\n\n1677\n01:33:53.950 --> 01:33:57.100\nBut basically, what you see here\nis it kicking on your system,\n\n1678\n01:33:57.100 --> 01:33:59.210\ndoing all the hardware detection and\n\n1679\n01:33:59.210 --> 01:34:02.030\nthings to get the operating\nsystem really doing the stuff.\n\n1680\n01:34:02.030 --> 01:34:03.300\nI just get past it, shoot.\n\n1681\n01:34:03.300 --> 01:34:07.910\nBut there was the file system check So if\nit detects that it's time to scan the hard\n\n1682\n01:34:07.910 --> 01:34:10.800\ndrives, it'll do the file system check and\nso on.\n\n1683\n01:34:10.800 --> 01:34:13.980\nSo that's what this guy does.\n\n1684\n01:34:13.980 --> 01:34:15.660\nReal important file, all right?\n\n1685\n01:34:15.660 --> 01:34:18.920\nReal long file,\ncuz it's got a lot of data in there.\n\n1686\n01:34:18.920 --> 01:34:22.580\nAnd so this is all stuff that\nruns when your system boots up.\n\n1687\n01:34:25.120 --> 01:34:29.280\nSo your kernel is very small, right,\nand by itself is not terribly useful.\n\n1688\n01:34:29.280 --> 01:34:34.860\nAll right, but your kernel combined\nwith a command line interpreter and\n\n1689\n01:34:34.860 --> 01:34:39.660\ncombined with other applications,\nthe GNU toolkit, all that other stuff,\n\n1690\n01:34:39.660 --> 01:34:45.050\nbecomes the full operating system,\nright, very very powerful.\n\n1691\n01:34:45.050 --> 01:34:49.910\nAll right, so just Like I mentioned,\nbe aware that this is the init system.\n\n1692\n01:34:49.910 --> 01:34:51.990\nThis is pretty much how it works.\n\n1693\n01:34:51.990 --> 01:34:54.690\nIf you're running systemd\nit's very similar.\n\n1694\n01:34:54.690 --> 01:34:58.020\nIt just has some extensions and\nthings that are a little bit different.\n\n1695\n01:34:58.020 --> 01:35:00.690\nIf you're running upstart,\nit has all sorts of extensions,\n\n1696\n01:35:00.690 --> 01:35:03.160\nthings that make it\na little more powerful.\n\n1697\n01:35:03.160 --> 01:35:05.320\nIn the future we'll see those get adopted,\nbut for\n\n1698\n01:35:05.320 --> 01:35:08.500\nright now If you learn the init system,\nupstart and\n\n1699\n01:35:08.500 --> 01:35:13.260\nsystem d are backwards compatible with it\nand so you're fine, you know this way.\n\n1700\n01:35:13.260 --> 01:35:17.990\nAnd on the exam it's init\nthat you're going to see.\n\n1701\n01:35:17.990 --> 01:35:24.124\nAll right so, other things to notice\nin here, so we've got the init.d.\n\n1702\n01:35:25.510 --> 01:35:29.410\nWhich is another script but\nit usually doesn't contain anything,\n\n1703\n01:35:29.410 --> 01:35:31.600\nit just references what this directory is.\n\n1704\n01:35:31.600 --> 01:35:36.530\nAnd you'll see rc.local is kind of\nthe same, basically it's just saying\n\n1705\n01:35:36.530 --> 01:35:40.120\nif you don't already have a lock file in\nplace for your system throw it there.\n\n1706\n01:35:40.120 --> 01:35:42.870\nSo there's not normally\na lot in these files.\n\n1707\n01:35:42.870 --> 01:35:47.570\nWe'll see more in these other ones,\nthese RC0 through RC6 files.\n\n1708\n01:35:47.570 --> 01:35:50.270\nYou'll see more stuff in those guys.\n\n1709\n01:35:50.270 --> 01:35:50.770\nOps.\n\n1710\n01:35:53.030 --> 01:35:56.040\nAll right, I think that's all\nI need on the boot process.\n\n1711\n01:35:56.040 --> 01:35:59.830\nWe've talked about the log files that\nare created slash bar, slash log, slash\n\n1712\n01:35:59.830 --> 01:36:04.560\nmessages, and slash bar, slash log, slash\nSlash dmessage, right, so that stuff.\n\n1713\n01:36:04.560 --> 01:36:07.204\nAnd now we've seen\nthe initialization system, and\n\n1714\n01:36:07.204 --> 01:36:09.857\nhow we get actually booted\nup into the OS that we see.\n\n1715\n01:36:09.857 --> 01:36:14.597\nIf we have a failure along the way, like\nyou boot up, you see your BIOS screen, and\n\n1716\n01:36:14.597 --> 01:36:15.921\nthen things just die.\n\n1717\n01:36:15.921 --> 01:36:18.070\nThat's usually a boot loader issue.\n\n1718\n01:36:18.070 --> 01:36:23.325\nWe may need to reinstall grab or whatever\nboot letter we're using you know it's just\n\n1719\n01:36:23.325 --> 01:36:28.061\nnot finding the driver the things run but\nif we get to grab and we pick our LS and\n\n1720\n01:36:28.061 --> 01:36:32.376\nit fails to start at all then maybe\nwe've got a bad path to our kernel.\n\n1721\n01:36:32.376 --> 01:36:34.652\nOr we've lost our hard drive, right.\n\n1722\n01:36:34.652 --> 01:36:39.428\nIf we get past grub, and\nit starts to boot the OS and it crashes,\n\n1723\n01:36:39.428 --> 01:36:42.960\nthen we might be having\na problem here in init.\n\n1724\n01:36:42.960 --> 01:36:47.790\nThere may be something set to start when\nour system boots that's causing a problem.\n\n1725\n01:36:47.790 --> 01:36:53.080\nIf you installed with a GUI, then maybe\nthe GUI that's causing the issue and\n\n1726\n01:36:53.080 --> 01:36:57.120\nyou wanna drop back down to doing text\nonly boot or something like that.\n\n1727\n01:36:57.120 --> 01:37:01.470\nAnd so you can use boot arguments\nto kinda influence and change that.\n\n1728\n01:37:01.470 --> 01:37:05.480\nNow init itself takes\na lot of arguments too.\n\n1729\n01:37:05.480 --> 01:37:10.860\nNotice all these files, rc0 through rc6,\nwhat the heck are those?\n\n1730\n01:37:10.860 --> 01:37:12.440\nWell those are run levels.\n\n1731\n01:37:12.440 --> 01:37:14.620\nWhen init starts your system up,\n\n1732\n01:37:14.620 --> 01:37:18.920\nit peaks between one of\nseveral different run levels.\n\n1733\n01:37:18.920 --> 01:37:22.710\nAnd a run level is like a different\nlevel of operating a state fair system.\n\n1734\n01:37:23.920 --> 01:37:28.355\nNow unfortunately, citizens is\nreally one of the biggest negatives.\n\n1735\n01:37:28.355 --> 01:37:31.975\nIf you love Linux and it's your favorite\noperating system on the planet and\n\n1736\n01:37:31.975 --> 01:37:34.435\nyou hate everything else,\nMicrosoft's terrible, Apple sucks,\n\n1737\n01:37:34.435 --> 01:37:39.055\nyou're just I'm all Linux,\neven if you love Linux one of the big\n\n1738\n01:37:39.055 --> 01:37:44.470\nnegatives of the operating system is\nthe variation between distributions.\n\n1739\n01:37:44.470 --> 01:37:47.400\nTwo different distros can do things\nin a very different way, and\n\n1740\n01:37:47.400 --> 01:37:49.320\nit makes it really challenging.\n\n1741\n01:37:49.320 --> 01:37:53.740\nThat is one of the things that holds Linux\nback from being just a super mega success,\n\n1742\n01:37:53.740 --> 01:37:55.600\nand this is one of those areas.\n\n1743\n01:37:55.600 --> 01:37:59.430\nThe run levels vary from distro to distro.\n\n1744\n01:37:59.430 --> 01:38:01.820\nThere are some things that are consistent.\n\n1745\n01:38:01.820 --> 01:38:05.420\nIf you look at the list, zero and six.\n\n1746\n01:38:05.420 --> 01:38:08.080\nZero and six are almost always the same.\n\n1747\n01:38:08.080 --> 01:38:11.050\nZero is powered off.\n\n1748\n01:38:11.050 --> 01:38:14.590\nIf you're at run level zero,\nthat means your system is off, right.\n\n1749\n01:38:14.590 --> 01:38:16.290\nAnd if your system is on and\n\n1750\n01:38:16.290 --> 01:38:19.930\nyou tell it to go to run level zero,\nthen it's gonna turn off, all right.\n\n1751\n01:38:19.930 --> 01:38:24.960\nSo that's zero, and then six is reboot.\n\n1752\n01:38:24.960 --> 01:38:27.940\nIf you're at run level six that means\nyour system should be rebooting.\n\n1753\n01:38:27.940 --> 01:38:29.700\nAnd if it's not, it will.\n\n1754\n01:38:29.700 --> 01:38:32.290\nRight.\nSo those two, run level zero, and\n\n1755\n01:38:32.290 --> 01:38:37.730\nrun level six, if you tell init to\nmove the system into run level zero,\n\n1756\n01:38:37.730 --> 01:38:41.830\nor tell it to move the system into run\nlevel six, it's either gonna shut down, or\n\n1757\n01:38:41.830 --> 01:38:43.170\nit's gonna reboot.\n\n1758\n01:38:43.170 --> 01:38:46.960\nAnd so think of these as like,\nshut down scripts, right.\n\n1759\n01:38:46.960 --> 01:38:50.380\nSomething that would happen on the system\nwhen it shuts down, or when it reboots,\n\n1760\n01:38:50.380 --> 01:38:51.570\nor whatever.\n\n1761\n01:38:51.570 --> 01:38:55.440\nAnd we don't normally have a whole heck\nof a lot that would be in one of those.\n\n1762\n01:38:55.440 --> 01:39:00.830\nSo if we go in and take a look, you'll see\na bunch of, here I am on the shutdown one,\n\n1763\n01:39:00.830 --> 01:39:04.850\nand you'll see it's got information\nin here on how to release locks,\n\n1764\n01:39:04.850 --> 01:39:05.995\nhow to shut down software.\n\n1765\n01:39:05.995 --> 01:39:09.275\nWhere I had to gracefully\ntake my system down.\n\n1766\n01:39:09.275 --> 01:39:11.953\nAnd so it's packed full of various things.\n\n1767\n01:39:11.953 --> 01:39:17.255\nNow notice how everything in here\nhas a number at the beginning.\n\n1768\n01:39:17.255 --> 01:39:21.470\nK01, K10, K50, K60, and so on, all right.\n\n1769\n01:39:21.470 --> 01:39:24.600\nThese scripts are run alphabetically.\n\n1770\n01:39:24.600 --> 01:39:29.720\nAnd so they put numbers on the beginning\nto control the order at which they boot.\n\n1771\n01:39:29.720 --> 01:39:31.670\nThat's why we have those numbers there.\n\n1772\n01:39:31.670 --> 01:39:36.580\nAnd so K99, my vmwaretools one\nlet me move that up there.\n\n1773\n01:39:36.580 --> 01:39:41.920\nWe'll run last versus K01\nwhich will run first, right.\n\n1774\n01:39:41.920 --> 01:39:44.550\nSo that's the order that they're\ngonna be run as we shut down.\n\n1775\n01:39:44.550 --> 01:39:50.390\nAnd then you see s00 and s01, those\nare run absolutely last, s00 kill all.\n\n1776\n01:39:50.390 --> 01:39:55.350\nIf any programs didn't gracefully shut\ndown power them off, that's it who cares,\n\n1777\n01:39:55.350 --> 01:40:00.370\nkill it right and then S01halt,\nif we just shut down all the programs and\n\n1778\n01:40:00.370 --> 01:40:03.160\nthe computer is still on, power it off.\n\n1779\n01:40:03.160 --> 01:40:08.600\nRight, so all these other scripts run\nto gracefully shut the system down,\n\n1780\n01:40:08.600 --> 01:40:10.810\nit's like a shutdown script, all right.\n\n1781\n01:40:10.810 --> 01:40:15.620\nAnd if I take a look at rc6.d.\n\n1782\n01:40:15.620 --> 01:40:17.970\nIt should be almost identical, right.\n\n1783\n01:40:17.970 --> 01:40:21.464\nMost systems don't have different\noperations between shutting down and\n\n1784\n01:40:21.464 --> 01:40:23.388\nrebooting, it's basically the same.\n\n1785\n01:40:23.388 --> 01:40:26.130\nThe difference is gonna\nbe at the very end.\n\n1786\n01:40:26.130 --> 01:40:28.380\nSee I've got S00 kill all and\nthen S01 reboot.\n\n1787\n01:40:29.900 --> 01:40:30.460\nOkay.\n\n1788\n01:40:30.460 --> 01:40:35.050\nSo instead of halting at the end of it and\npowering off, this time I reboot.\n\n1789\n01:40:35.050 --> 01:40:38.649\nBut otherwise,\nthe rest of these are probably identical.\n\n1790\n01:40:38.649 --> 01:40:43.208\nI'm not gonna go file by file and\ncompare but they should be identical.\n\n1791\n01:40:45.058 --> 01:40:48.143\nAll right, and you'll see all\nof these are just links, and\n\n1792\n01:40:48.143 --> 01:40:51.180\nsee how they're linked to init.d/ blah,\nblah, blah?\n\n1793\n01:40:51.180 --> 01:40:53.040\nLet me redo that there.\n\n1794\n01:40:53.040 --> 01:40:55.750\nSo they're all just linked\nto scripts in other places.\n\n1795\n01:40:55.750 --> 01:40:59.750\nWhen you install packages and software and\nso on, it creates these links to say,\n\n1796\n01:40:59.750 --> 01:41:02.190\nhey when you shut down,\ngracefully shut me down please.\n\n1797\n01:41:02.190 --> 01:41:03.900\nAnd when you reboot,\ngracefully shut me down.\n\n1798\n01:41:03.900 --> 01:41:06.772\nRight.\nSo MySQL, and Apache, and all those guys,\n\n1799\n01:41:06.772 --> 01:41:11.390\nthey wanna gracefully shutdown, and so\nthey link right into that init system.\n\n1800\n01:41:13.280 --> 01:41:17.990\nIf you go to upstart, or if you go to\nsystem d these links they still stay in\n\n1801\n01:41:17.990 --> 01:41:21.410\nthe same place and they respect that,\nor you can link to the new locations.\n\n1802\n01:41:21.410 --> 01:41:24.410\nBut since they're just links it's real\neasy to just put those pointers in, right.\n\n1803\n01:41:24.410 --> 01:41:25.900\nThat's the glory of the linking system.\n\n1804\n01:41:25.900 --> 01:41:27.818\nWe talked about that in\nthe shared library section.\n\n1805\n01:41:30.745 --> 01:41:35.950\nAll right, so\nthose are two of the run levels.\n\n1806\n01:41:35.950 --> 01:41:37.990\nWhat about all the others, all right.\n\n1807\n01:41:37.990 --> 01:41:40.790\nWell I absolutely hate to do this, but\n\n1808\n01:41:40.790 --> 01:41:46.096\nI'm gonna do something that I don't like\nto do, which is reference Wikipedia.\n\n1809\n01:41:46.096 --> 01:41:50.050\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Wikipedia, they have a great article on\n\n1810\n01:41:50.050 --> 01:41:53.070\nLinux run levels that shows\nthe different run levels for\n\n1811\n01:41:53.070 --> 01:41:58.010\ndifferent distributions and\nI usually just Google for it there we go.\n\n1812\n01:41:58.010 --> 01:42:00.970\nSo I just did a Google search for Linux\nrun levels and Wikipedia is the first\n\n1813\n01:42:00.970 --> 01:42:05.950\none that comes up and you take it with\na grain of salt because it is Wikipedia.\n\n1814\n01:42:05.950 --> 01:42:09.730\nBut as you get in here, it'll start\nto list the different run levels.\n\n1815\n01:42:09.730 --> 01:42:14.360\nAnd notice how Debian has zero for\nhalt and six for reboot.\n\n1816\n01:42:14.360 --> 01:42:17.550\nBut look at one and\nthen two through five, okay.\n\n1817\n01:42:17.550 --> 01:42:21.230\nRun level one is single user mode.\n\n1818\n01:42:21.230 --> 01:42:26.660\nWhen you choose to go to run\nlevel one all of your extra TTYs,\n\n1819\n01:42:26.660 --> 01:42:31.520\nall of your remote shells, all of your\nother user access is shut off and\n\n1820\n01:42:31.520 --> 01:42:35.710\nall your left with is one\nconsole connection, all right.\n\n1821\n01:42:35.710 --> 01:42:40.090\nAs an administrator, if you wanna\nperform an action on a server but\n\n1822\n01:42:40.090 --> 01:42:43.190\nthere's files that are in\nuse files that are locked.\n\n1823\n01:42:43.190 --> 01:42:45.230\nOther people making changes in the system.\n\n1824\n01:42:45.230 --> 01:42:49.550\nAnd you need to ensure that you have\nexclusive access to the machine.\n\n1825\n01:42:49.550 --> 01:42:52.290\nJust you nobody else can access the data.\n\n1826\n01:42:52.290 --> 01:42:53.780\nYou go run level one.\n\n1827\n01:42:53.780 --> 01:42:57.770\nWhen you go to run level one,\nyou still have access via that console.\n\n1828\n01:42:57.770 --> 01:42:59.300\nNo one else has access.\n\n1829\n01:42:59.300 --> 01:43:03.810\nNow be careful because if you SSH'd\nin you're not on the console are you?\n\n1830\n01:43:03.810 --> 01:43:05.010\nSo you just kicked yourself out.\n\n1831\n01:43:05.010 --> 01:43:07.760\nSo you don't want to do that, you want\nto be sitting physically in front of\n\n1832\n01:43:07.760 --> 01:43:11.390\nthe machine at that local console\nbecause that's the default screen,\n\n1833\n01:43:11.390 --> 01:43:14.090\nthat's the one that's gonna be left\non when you go to run level one.\n\n1834\n01:43:15.200 --> 01:43:17.200\nSo run level one, single user mode.\n\n1835\n01:43:17.200 --> 01:43:18.660\nEasy to remember, one user.\n\n1836\n01:43:19.720 --> 01:43:21.620\nBut then two through five,\n\n1837\n01:43:21.620 --> 01:43:27.440\nfull multi-user boot with console logins\nand display manager if installed.\n\n1838\n01:43:27.440 --> 01:43:30.030\nThat means all your console\nlogins are present.\n\n1839\n01:43:30.030 --> 01:43:32.400\nYour SSH, all your TTYs are running.\n\n1840\n01:43:32.400 --> 01:43:36.720\nAnd if you installed the GUI, that it'll\nboot into X Windows, and you'll see that,\n\n1841\n01:43:36.720 --> 01:43:39.290\nand have access to your\ngraphical user interface.\n\n1842\n01:43:39.290 --> 01:43:39.940\nAll right.\n\n1843\n01:43:39.940 --> 01:43:42.900\nSo run levels two through\nfive are all identical.\n\n1844\n01:43:42.900 --> 01:43:45.630\nBut it's not like that, in every system.\n\n1845\n01:43:45.630 --> 01:43:47.410\nIn fact, if I go through and\n\n1846\n01:43:47.410 --> 01:43:52.227\nfind Red Hat, there, notice how\nRed Hat has a couple extras, okay.\n\n1847\n01:43:53.460 --> 01:43:55.700\nRed Hat has run level one,\nwhich is single user.\n\n1848\n01:43:56.700 --> 01:44:02.350\nNotice how it says single user text\nmode without networking, right.\n\n1849\n01:44:02.350 --> 01:44:04.470\nSo you boot in a single user and\n\n1850\n01:44:04.470 --> 01:44:07.720\nnot only is a single user, you don't\nhave access to your network card, right.\n\n1851\n01:44:07.720 --> 01:44:11.038\nNo network enabled in single user.\n\n1852\n01:44:11.038 --> 01:44:12.610\nNumber two, it says not present, right.\n\n1853\n01:44:12.610 --> 01:44:14.522\nNone to find.\n\n1854\n01:44:14.522 --> 01:44:20.300\nNow I'll tell you guys in CentOS,\ndoes CentOS have a separate entry?\n\n1855\n01:44:22.610 --> 01:44:25.568\nIt doesn't look like it does.\n\n1856\n01:44:25.568 --> 01:44:30.944\nIn CentOS, number two is normally\ndefined as single user with networking.\n\n1857\n01:44:30.944 --> 01:44:34.705\nSo yeah,\nthis Wikipedia article doesn't say that.\n\n1858\n01:44:34.705 --> 01:44:39.350\nBut yeah, so number two is normally\nsingle user with networking.\n\n1859\n01:44:39.350 --> 01:44:42.740\nBecause if you wanna go to single user\nmode and then do some yum updates or\n\n1860\n01:44:42.740 --> 01:44:46.650\nsomething like that, well you can't,\ncuz you've got no networking.\n\n1861\n01:44:46.650 --> 01:44:51.010\nSo single user with networking on\nrun level two, for a lot of them.\n\n1862\n01:44:51.010 --> 01:44:54.330\nNumber three, full multi-user text mode.\n\n1863\n01:44:54.330 --> 01:44:58.530\nSo it's still booting in text mode,\nno GUI, but now it is full multi-user, so\n\n1864\n01:44:58.530 --> 01:45:03.110\nall your ttys are running and\nnetwork access is there, all right?\n\n1865\n01:45:03.110 --> 01:45:06.168\nRed Hat sent to us they don't use number\nfour, so number four just gets skipped,.\n\n1866\n01:45:06.168 --> 01:45:09.520\nAnd when I say that they don't use it,\nthey don't use it by default.\n\n1867\n01:45:09.520 --> 01:45:12.170\nYou saw the rc4.d file.\n\n1868\n01:45:12.170 --> 01:45:13.780\nYou can use it, if you want.\n\n1869\n01:45:13.780 --> 01:45:17.180\nYou can define rc4.d to\nbe whatever you want.\n\n1870\n01:45:17.180 --> 01:45:19.470\nYou can create your own\nspecial run level if you want.\n\n1871\n01:45:20.990 --> 01:45:24.852\nAnd then number five is full\nmulti-user graphical mode with\n\n1872\n01:45:24.852 --> 01:45:29.230\nan X-based Windows login screen,\nif you got it installed.\n\n1873\n01:45:29.230 --> 01:45:32.583\nSo most of us are gonna be at run\nlevel five most of the time, right?\n\n1874\n01:45:32.583 --> 01:45:35.200\nA healthy system will\nbe at run level five.\n\n1875\n01:45:35.200 --> 01:45:38.710\nThat's full services,\neverything working, right?\n\n1876\n01:45:38.710 --> 01:45:42.820\nIf you're a Windows user,\nthink of this stuff kinda like safe mode.\n\n1877\n01:45:42.820 --> 01:45:44.520\nExcept you got more than one safe mode.\n\n1878\n01:45:44.520 --> 01:45:46.419\nWell, I guess Windows has got more\nthan one safe mode, doesn't it?\n\n1879\n01:45:46.419 --> 01:45:47.100\n>> Yep.\n\n1880\n01:45:47.100 --> 01:45:49.070\n>> So I guess it's kinda the same.\n\n1881\n01:45:49.070 --> 01:45:54.400\nSingle user no networking, single user\nwith networking, multi-user text mode.\n\n1882\n01:45:54.400 --> 01:45:57.910\nEach of these are just a little bit more\nand a little bit more feature wise, but\n\n1883\n01:45:57.910 --> 01:46:01.570\nnot going all the way until we\nget to run level five, all right?\n\n1884\n01:46:01.570 --> 01:46:03.475\nNow look at some of these\nother ones like Ubuntu.\n\n1885\n01:46:03.475 --> 01:46:05.360\nUbuntu of very popular, right?\n\n1886\n01:46:05.360 --> 01:46:07.590\nAnd so they've got single-user mode for\n\n1887\n01:46:07.590 --> 01:46:11.150\nnumber one, graphical multi-user\nwith networking, number two.\n\n1888\n01:46:11.150 --> 01:46:14.070\nThat sounds pretty full-featured, right?\n\n1889\n01:46:14.070 --> 01:46:16.776\nAnd then three through\nfive not configured, but\n\n1890\n01:46:16.776 --> 01:46:19.024\nconfigured the same as two, all right.\n\n1891\n01:46:19.024 --> 01:46:22.060\nSo that means two through\nfive are really identical.\n\n1892\n01:46:22.060 --> 01:46:26.723\nUbuntu really just has 0,\n1, 2, and 6, all right.\n\n1893\n01:46:26.723 --> 01:46:31.978\nSUSE Linux, you've got single\nuser mode as run level one.\n\n1894\n01:46:31.978 --> 01:46:35.665\nYou've got multi-user mode\nwithout networking for two.\n\n1895\n01:46:35.665 --> 01:46:39.290\nMulti-user console logins only,\nfor number three.\n\n1896\n01:46:39.290 --> 01:46:41.190\nAnd then you know not use number four.\n\n1897\n01:46:41.190 --> 01:46:44.870\nSo, little variations between\nthe distros just be aware of that and\n\n1898\n01:46:44.870 --> 01:46:48.070\nagain that is it's probably\none of the biggest negatives\n\n1899\n01:46:48.070 --> 01:46:52.830\nwith Linux is the inconsistencies when\nyou go from distro to distro, all right?\n\n1900\n01:46:52.830 --> 01:46:58.670\nSo you can't just blindly\nmemorize a list of run levels and\n\n1901\n01:46:58.670 --> 01:47:00.730\nknow that that's exactly how\nthat machine's gonna behave.\n\n1902\n01:47:00.730 --> 01:47:02.810\nYou have to understand\nwhich distro it is and\n\n1903\n01:47:02.810 --> 01:47:04.580\nhow it handles those run levels,\nall right?\n\n1904\n01:47:04.580 --> 01:47:08.650\nAnd you can always read the scripts to\nfind out the difference, but for the exam\n\n1905\n01:47:08.650 --> 01:47:12.100\nyou can definitely expect to see the one's\nthat you know are the same, right?\n\n1906\n01:47:12.100 --> 01:47:18.619\nOn all of these, zero is halt, one is\nsingle user, and six is reboot, right.\n\n1907\n01:47:18.619 --> 01:47:21.640\nThe other ones are the ones that change,\ntwo through five.\n\n1908\n01:47:21.640 --> 01:47:26.000\nAll the others, they have flexibility,\nbut zero, one and six are the same, so\n\n1909\n01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:31.870\nthose you definitely want to commit\nto memory if we can, all right.\n\n1910\n01:47:31.870 --> 01:47:34.990\nWell, I've talked about the run levels and\nwhat they are.\n\n1911\n01:47:34.990 --> 01:47:36.460\nLet's take a break and\n\n1912\n01:47:36.460 --> 01:47:38.920\nwhen we get back I wanna show you\nhow we can use those run levels.\n\n1913\n01:47:38.920 --> 01:47:43.197\nHow we can put them into action for\nfun and for profit, right.\n\n1914\n01:47:43.197 --> 01:47:44.290\n>> Right.\n\n1915\n01:47:44.290 --> 01:47:48.355\n>> So stayed tuned, when we get\nback more run levels after this.\n\n1916\n01:47:48.355 --> 01:47:56.050\n[MUSIC]\n\n1917\n01:47:56.050 --> 01:47:59.330\nAll right, so before the break we\nwere talking about run levels.\n\n1918\n01:47:59.330 --> 01:48:03.200\nAnd how init uses those run levels\nto figure out exactly what parts of\n\n1919\n01:48:03.200 --> 01:48:06.760\nthe system to start up and\ngive us functionality.\n\n1920\n01:48:06.760 --> 01:48:12.610\nWell, the init command, we also use it\nto move from one run level to another.\n\n1921\n01:48:12.610 --> 01:48:15.210\nWhen we boot up, it's pretty much\ngonna boot up to run level five,\n\n1922\n01:48:15.210 --> 01:48:16.470\nthat's what it's shooting for.\n\n1923\n01:48:16.470 --> 01:48:20.950\nFull networking, full multi-user,\nfull GUI, if installed, right.\n\n1924\n01:48:20.950 --> 01:48:23.370\nBut, but\nwe may want to manually override that, and\n\n1925\n01:48:23.370 --> 01:48:26.390\nwe can do it at any time,\nusing the init command, right.\n\n1926\n01:48:26.390 --> 01:48:27.560\nNow one word of caution.\n\n1927\n01:48:28.610 --> 01:48:31.840\nLinux is a fully multitasking\noperating system, so\n\n1928\n01:48:31.840 --> 01:48:36.230\nyou can expect that, more than one thing\nis going on in your system at a time.\n\n1929\n01:48:36.230 --> 01:48:40.330\nAnd so as we work with it if\nwe're about to move run levels,\n\n1930\n01:48:40.330 --> 01:48:42.410\nit's kind of like rebooting in a way.\n\n1931\n01:48:42.410 --> 01:48:46.470\nAnd so you can really disrupt other\npeople working on your system.\n\n1932\n01:48:46.470 --> 01:48:48.840\nSo before you do anything with run levels,\n\n1933\n01:48:48.840 --> 01:48:52.040\nit's always a good idea to see\nwho else might be in your system.\n\n1934\n01:48:52.040 --> 01:48:56.080\nNow, I know we talked about the PS command\nto be able to look at the processes on our\n\n1935\n01:48:56.080 --> 01:48:59.040\nsystem, and see who's running what.\n\n1936\n01:48:59.040 --> 01:49:01.810\nThe one command that I really\nlike from back in the day,\n\n1937\n01:49:01.810 --> 01:49:04.600\nit's an old command is the who command.\n\n1938\n01:49:04.600 --> 01:49:08.640\nWho is a simple command that'll just\nshow you who's logged in to your system.\n\n1939\n01:49:08.640 --> 01:49:11.990\nSo let me run that here, so\nI'm just gonna do a who.\n\n1940\n01:49:11.990 --> 01:49:16.960\nAnd I can see that, I'm logged in as\nroot on tty1, I can see that Bob,\n\n1941\n01:49:16.960 --> 01:49:20.410\nTom, and D Pezet are all logged in also.\n\n1942\n01:49:20.410 --> 01:49:25.710\nAnd so if I do anything to this system\nI can be disrupting their worse.\n\n1943\n01:49:25.710 --> 01:49:28.740\nSo I need to be careful about that and\n\n1944\n01:49:28.740 --> 01:49:34.990\nI normally do it like a who -r to\nsee what run level I'm currently in.\n\n1945\n01:49:34.990 --> 01:49:37.750\nSo we have a couple of\ndifferent variations of\n\n1946\n01:49:37.750 --> 01:49:40.540\nwho that come in handy when we're\ngoing to gather information.\n\n1947\n01:49:40.540 --> 01:49:45.120\nSo step one, I need to say am I\nalready in the run level I want.\n\n1948\n01:49:45.120 --> 01:49:45.900\nI'm in run level three.\n\n1949\n01:49:45.900 --> 01:49:48.990\nAnd that's because I didn't install\nthe graphical user interface.\n\n1950\n01:49:48.990 --> 01:49:51.060\nWe didn't install the GUI on this system.\n\n1951\n01:49:51.060 --> 01:49:53.240\nSo there is no need to\ngo to run level five.\n\n1952\n01:49:53.240 --> 01:49:55.360\nI'm at run level three.\n\n1953\n01:49:55.360 --> 01:49:59.800\nFull multiuser with networking,\nand it's text-based, okay?\n\n1954\n01:49:59.800 --> 01:50:02.880\nSo that's what I'm in right now,\nwho -r told me my current run level.\n\n1955\n01:50:02.880 --> 01:50:05.430\nAnd then who shows me these other users.\n\n1956\n01:50:05.430 --> 01:50:08.350\nSo if I'm gonna be rebooting my system,\n\n1957\n01:50:08.350 --> 01:50:11.340\nI need to make sure these other\nusers know about it, okay?\n\n1958\n01:50:11.340 --> 01:50:13.500\nSo I can reach out to them via any means.\n\n1959\n01:50:13.500 --> 01:50:17.698\nThere's actually means to send messages\nthrough the command line interface.\n\n1960\n01:50:17.698 --> 01:50:21.235\nBut in this day and age these people\nare not normally in interactive shells,\n\n1961\n01:50:21.235 --> 01:50:23.730\nthey're not necessarily\ngonna see those messages.\n\n1962\n01:50:23.730 --> 01:50:27.010\nSo we'll typically revert to email,\nphone call,\n\n1963\n01:50:27.010 --> 01:50:29.810\nthings like that to reach out\nto them to let them know.\n\n1964\n01:50:29.810 --> 01:50:31.690\nBut, it is a good idea to know\nwho you're about to disrupt.\n\n1965\n01:50:32.810 --> 01:50:35.800\nAll right, so then,\nwhen I'm ready to move run levels.\n\n1966\n01:50:35.800 --> 01:50:38.370\nSo, maybe I wanna make\na change on this system.\n\n1967\n01:50:38.370 --> 01:50:42.320\nAnd the change, is one that's going to\naffect files that people might be in.\n\n1968\n01:50:42.320 --> 01:50:44.460\nMaybe I've got a database or\nsomething like that.\n\n1969\n01:50:44.460 --> 01:50:45.610\nWell, if it was a database,\n\n1970\n01:50:45.610 --> 01:50:48.320\nI could simply take the database\ndown to single user mode, right.\n\n1971\n01:50:48.320 --> 01:50:50.940\nMost database servers\nwill do that like My SQL.\n\n1972\n01:50:50.940 --> 01:50:54.310\nBut if it's some other application\nthat doesn't have that functionality,\n\n1973\n01:50:54.310 --> 01:50:57.750\nthen I can just take my system\ndown to run level one and\n\n1974\n01:50:57.750 --> 01:51:00.470\nwhen that happens it's\nnow in single user mode.\n\n1975\n01:51:00.470 --> 01:51:02.078\nAnd the command to do it is super easy.\n\n1976\n01:51:02.078 --> 01:51:06.740\nIt's just init followed by whatever\nnumber run level we wanna go to.\n\n1977\n01:51:06.740 --> 01:51:09.820\nIf we do init zero,\nyour system's gonna shut down.\n\n1978\n01:51:09.820 --> 01:51:11.500\nIf we do init six,\nyour system's gonna reboot.\n\n1979\n01:51:11.500 --> 01:51:16.970\nBut if we do init 1, it's gonna\ntake us down to single user mode.\n\n1980\n01:51:16.970 --> 01:51:19.640\nNow you do have to be root to run this,\nI'm logged in as root right now.\n\n1981\n01:51:19.640 --> 01:51:24.230\nAnd if I run init 1, it's gonna take\nit down to single user mode, okay.\n\n1982\n01:51:24.230 --> 01:51:28.250\nNow those other users are logged in, and\nif I jump over and start to take a look at\n\n1983\n01:51:28.250 --> 01:51:33.310\nwhat's going on for them, well, I've got\nthem right here, they're still logged in.\n\n1984\n01:51:33.310 --> 01:51:35.650\nRight, well, sort of.\n\n1985\n01:51:35.650 --> 01:51:36.930\nIt's actually locked up.\n\n1986\n01:51:36.930 --> 01:51:38.000\nThese are the other users,\n\n1987\n01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:43.520\nI've got Bob here who's in the Midnight\nCommander, which is locked up.\n\n1988\n01:51:45.100 --> 01:51:49.150\nTom was in Links, a text-based web\nbrowser which is also locked up.\n\n1989\n01:51:49.150 --> 01:51:51.710\nAnd then I was over here and\nthis is locked up.\n\n1990\n01:51:51.710 --> 01:51:53.590\nI'm typing and nothing is happening.\n\n1991\n01:51:53.590 --> 01:51:57.210\nThose users are immediately locked out and\ntheir ttys are killed.\n\n1992\n01:51:57.210 --> 01:51:58.850\nSo the ttys are dead and\n\n1993\n01:51:58.850 --> 01:52:01.330\nthat's why I can't even type\nany commands in here, right?\n\n1994\n01:52:02.560 --> 01:52:04.670\nAre there any warning messages\non my screen telling me that was\n\n1995\n01:52:04.670 --> 01:52:05.220\nabout to happen?\n\n1996\n01:52:05.220 --> 01:52:05.830\n>> No.\n\n1997\n01:52:05.830 --> 01:52:07.780\n>> No, when you run init and\n\n1998\n01:52:07.780 --> 01:52:12.050\na number, it instantly\ntransitions that other run level.\n\n1999\n01:52:12.050 --> 01:52:12.990\nYou don't get a warning.\n\n2000\n01:52:12.990 --> 01:52:15.710\nThere is no message displayed\nto the other people.\n\n2001\n01:52:15.710 --> 01:52:18.950\nAll right, so\ndefinitely be careful with that.\n\n2002\n01:52:18.950 --> 01:52:21.650\nAnd I can see back on\nmy main terminal here\n\n2003\n01:52:21.650 --> 01:52:24.960\nit said init was told to\ngo to single user mode.\n\n2004\n01:52:24.960 --> 01:52:27.938\nIt's killed everything and\nit's dropped me into single user mode.\n\n2005\n01:52:27.938 --> 01:52:33.718\nWhen it did that,\nit ran the script inside of rc1.d.\n\n2006\n01:52:33.718 --> 01:52:37.903\nThat told it what to do to get this\nsystem into this current state.\n\n2007\n01:52:37.903 --> 01:52:42.280\nAnd if I do a who, no one is logged in.\n\n2008\n01:52:42.280 --> 01:52:45.390\nIt's single user mode,\nI'm the only one that's logged in.\n\n2009\n01:52:45.390 --> 01:52:49.170\nAnd if I do a who -r,\nI can see my run-level is S.\n\n2010\n01:52:49.170 --> 01:52:51.870\nThis is kind of an annoying\nthing that you'll see.\n\n2011\n01:52:51.870 --> 01:52:53.190\nS is the equivalent of one.\n\n2012\n01:52:53.190 --> 01:52:56.180\nS means single user and\nit's just an alias for one.\n\n2013\n01:52:56.180 --> 01:52:57.138\nSo I'm in run-level 1.\n\n2014\n01:52:59.666 --> 01:53:00.840\nAll right.\n\n2015\n01:53:00.840 --> 01:53:04.450\nAnd if I wanna move back to\nrun-level 3 like we were before,\n\n2016\n01:53:04.450 --> 01:53:07.770\nI can just say init 3, and\nit's gonna move me back.\n\n2017\n01:53:07.770 --> 01:53:12.650\nNow it's gonna run the things inside of\nrc3.d to move us back into that mode.\n\n2018\n01:53:12.650 --> 01:53:16.288\nI can see my network card just\nturned on cuz the network was off.\n\n2019\n01:53:16.288 --> 01:53:20.184\nAnd now, I'm back in here and\nI can get logged in.\n\n2020\n01:53:20.184 --> 01:53:24.393\nAnd if I jump over to one of those other\nshells, those other shells have reset.\n\n2021\n01:53:24.393 --> 01:53:29.582\nAnd so if I come in here and\nlog back in as whatever, right?\n\n2022\n01:53:29.582 --> 01:53:31.893\nI can start to log back in as those users.\n\n2023\n01:53:36.308 --> 01:53:40.168\nAnd let's go to cnn.com this time.\n\n2024\n01:53:40.168 --> 01:53:42.410\nI can't imagine their\npage is gonna render.\n\n2025\n01:53:42.410 --> 01:53:43.385\nCan't show all the ads.\n\n2026\n01:53:43.385 --> 01:53:44.558\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n2027\n01:53:44.558 --> 01:53:48.338\n>> So anyhow, we'll let him go.\n\n2028\n01:53:48.338 --> 01:53:51.340\nYeah, all right,\nit's already taking too long.\n\n2029\n01:53:52.840 --> 01:53:54.760\nSo anyhow, so\nall these users can get logged back in,\n\n2030\n01:53:54.760 --> 01:53:59.630\ncuz now we're back In multiuser mode,\nand I can get in here and I can work.\n\n2031\n01:53:59.630 --> 01:54:01.040\nEverything's working\nthe way it's supposed to.\n\n2032\n01:54:01.040 --> 01:54:02.880\n>> There you go.\n>> There's good old CNN.\n\n2033\n01:54:02.880 --> 01:54:06.570\nAnd so we can get up on the latest\ntext-based news and make ourselves happy.\n\n2034\n01:54:06.570 --> 01:54:09.050\nSo [LAUGH] cuz I'm not sure\nit's all good new, right?\n\n2035\n01:54:10.060 --> 01:54:14.676\nAnd if I do my who, I can see each\nof the users that are logged in, and\n\n2036\n01:54:14.676 --> 01:54:18.170\nwho -r, there's that run-level, all right?\n\n2037\n01:54:18.170 --> 01:54:20.090\nSo the init command, super simple, right?\n\n2038\n01:54:20.090 --> 01:54:22.500\nInit, followed by a number, right?\n\n2039\n01:54:22.500 --> 01:54:26.570\nNow if you go and Google around on the\ninternet, you will find some references\n\n2040\n01:54:26.570 --> 01:54:30.940\nto another command called telinit,\nall right?\n\n2041\n01:54:30.940 --> 01:54:34.670\nRemember when I ran init 6,\non the screen it said,\n\n2042\n01:54:34.670 --> 01:54:39.390\ntelling init to load run-level 6,\nor whatever it said, right?\n\n2043\n01:54:39.390 --> 01:54:42.538\nWell, telinit is another command\nthat can do the same thing.\n\n2044\n01:54:42.538 --> 01:54:47.567\nIn most modern distributions, telinit and\ninit are basically the same thing.\n\n2045\n01:54:47.567 --> 01:54:50.996\nSo calling one versus the other,\nso if I were to say telinit 1,\n\n2046\n01:54:50.996 --> 01:54:55.428\nit's gonna move me into single user mode,\njust like if I ran init 1, all right?\n\n2047\n01:54:55.428 --> 01:54:57.391\nThe reason the telinit command was nice,\n\n2048\n01:54:57.391 --> 01:54:59.950\nwas that you use to be\nable to set a time delay.\n\n2049\n01:54:59.950 --> 01:55:02.415\nSo you used to be able to go -t 60,\n\n2050\n01:55:02.415 --> 01:55:06.870\nand now it waits 60 seconds before\nit moved into run-level 1, and\n\n2051\n01:55:06.870 --> 01:55:11.970\nthat would notify the other users that a\nrun-level change is about to happen, okay?\n\n2052\n01:55:11.970 --> 01:55:16.072\nUnfortunately most distros or at least\nmost of the ones I've used lately,\n\n2053\n01:55:16.072 --> 01:55:18.038\nno longer support the -t command.\n\n2054\n01:55:18.038 --> 01:55:21.796\nAnd so\ntelinit really becomes the same as a init.\n\n2055\n01:55:21.796 --> 01:55:26.422\nAnd if I pull up its man page,\nyou'll see telinit plus OPTIONS, and\n\n2056\n01:55:26.422 --> 01:55:27.920\nthen your RUNLEVEL.\n\n2057\n01:55:27.920 --> 01:55:32.317\nAnd if I look at the OPTIONS down here,\nyou've got -e for\n\n2058\n01:55:32.317 --> 01:55:35.718\na KEY VALUE for\nthe RUNLEVEL and that's it.\n\n2059\n01:55:35.718 --> 01:55:38.459\nSo the -t option isn't even there, but\n\n2060\n01:55:38.459 --> 01:55:43.708\non older ones you did have a t option and\nyou could use that to specify the time.\n\n2061\n01:55:43.708 --> 01:55:48.878\nAll right, so, for us init and\ntelinit are effectively the same now.\n\n2062\n01:55:48.878 --> 01:55:54.338\nYou just say init 2, telinit 6,\nwhatever is it that you're trying to do.\n\n2063\n01:55:57.798 --> 01:56:03.070\nAll right, some other options that we\nhave that come to do with RUNLEVELS.\n\n2064\n01:56:04.370 --> 01:56:06.232\nI may wanna shut my computer down, right?\n\n2065\n01:56:06.232 --> 01:56:09.350\nWell, shutting your computer down\nis taking it to run-level 0.\n\n2066\n01:56:09.350 --> 01:56:13.260\nThe problem is if you use run init 0,\nit's an immediate thing,\n\n2067\n01:56:13.260 --> 01:56:16.930\nit shuts your system down and\nusers don't get a warning and all that.\n\n2068\n01:56:16.930 --> 01:56:20.030\nIt would be nice to give them\na warning if you're gonna shut down or\n\n2069\n01:56:20.030 --> 01:56:21.580\nreboot or whatever.\n\n2070\n01:56:21.580 --> 01:56:23.660\nWell, the init command doesn't do it.\n\n2071\n01:56:23.660 --> 01:56:26.370\nBut the shutdown command does.\n\n2072\n01:56:26.370 --> 01:56:28.260\nWe have a command called shutdown.\n\n2073\n01:56:28.260 --> 01:56:32.220\nAnd we can use it shut the system down\nas well as to reboot, it can do both.\n\n2074\n01:56:32.220 --> 01:56:34.690\nWhen you look at the options\ninside of the shutdown command,\n\n2075\n01:56:34.690 --> 01:56:38.390\nyou'll see it has a time and a message.\n\n2076\n01:56:38.390 --> 01:56:42.010\nYou can send a message to your users\nletting them know that the shutdown is\n\n2077\n01:56:42.010 --> 01:56:45.880\nimminent, that it's coming down the line\nand they need to get out, all right?\n\n2078\n01:56:45.880 --> 01:56:52.580\nNotice we can add a -r to make it reboot\nif we want, or a -h, -H, or -P, all right?\n\n2079\n01:56:53.640 --> 01:56:54.780\nThe two h's.\n\n2080\n01:56:54.780 --> 01:56:57.868\nThe lower case h,\nthat's gonna tell us to power off, right?\n\n2081\n01:56:57.868 --> 01:57:01.420\nWhen the system finishes shut down, in\nother words, once it gets to run-level 0,\n\n2082\n01:57:01.420 --> 01:57:04.238\neverything shut down,\nthen it powers off the system, all right?\n\n2083\n01:57:04.238 --> 01:57:06.570\nOr at least it tries to, all right?\n\n2084\n01:57:06.570 --> 01:57:08.022\nSo it's just really halting.\n\n2085\n01:57:08.022 --> 01:57:14.500\n-H says we request a halt, and\nthen -P requests the system powers off.\n\n2086\n01:57:14.500 --> 01:57:15.910\nThose all sound the same, don't they?\n\n2087\n01:57:15.910 --> 01:57:16.510\n>> Yeah.\n\n2088\n01:57:16.510 --> 01:57:20.690\n>> Well, there's different power\nmanagement systems in different hardware.\n\n2089\n01:57:20.690 --> 01:57:25.490\nSome of them will accept different\nvariations of the power off command.\n\n2090\n01:57:25.490 --> 01:57:28.020\nSome of them you go to halt and\nthe software freezes and\n\n2091\n01:57:28.020 --> 01:57:30.920\nthen the computer doesn't turn off,\nit just sits there, right?\n\n2092\n01:57:30.920 --> 01:57:33.170\nSo what you need to do is\nlook at your hardware and\n\n2093\n01:57:33.170 --> 01:57:35.300\nsee which of these three works.\n\n2094\n01:57:35.300 --> 01:57:37.808\nOn most modern hardware,\nall three of those work, and\n\n2095\n01:57:37.808 --> 01:57:40.108\nthey'll pretty much all\ndo the same exact thing.\n\n2096\n01:57:40.108 --> 01:57:43.906\nBut on some older hardware, you've\ngot to pick the one that's right for\n\n2097\n01:57:43.906 --> 01:57:47.406\nthe way power management works\ninside of your system, all right?\n\n2098\n01:57:47.406 --> 01:57:50.160\nSo some of the other options in here.\n\n2099\n01:57:51.410 --> 01:57:53.640\nWell, it doesn't have\na command line option but\n\n2100\n01:57:53.640 --> 01:57:58.010\nyou specify the option of how\nmuch time you want to wait.\n\n2101\n01:57:58.010 --> 01:58:01.540\nSo if I wanna shut down,\nI can specify a shut down time and\n\n2102\n01:58:01.540 --> 01:58:04.660\nset it a minute from now or\nsomething like that.\n\n2103\n01:58:04.660 --> 01:58:10.351\nSo I could say, here I'll do five minutes\nfrom now, if I say shutdown 5, okay?\n\n2104\n01:58:10.351 --> 01:58:14.615\nThat's gonna shut down my computer\nfive minutes from now, all right?\n\n2105\n01:58:14.615 --> 01:58:16.529\nSo now I've put the shutdown in and\n\n2106\n01:58:16.529 --> 01:58:21.158\nit's telling me it's gonna shut it down\nat 2:29 PM, so five minutes from now.\n\n2107\n01:58:21.158 --> 01:58:24.200\nNow notice it's doing a broadcast message.\n\n2108\n01:58:24.200 --> 01:58:28.250\nIt's letting my users know the system is\ngonna be shutting down in five minutes.\n\n2109\n01:58:28.250 --> 01:58:31.280\nAnd if I jump over to some\nof those other users,\n\n2110\n01:58:31.280 --> 01:58:35.188\nhere I am in Midnight Commander and\nsee how Bob got a notice.\n\n2111\n01:58:35.188 --> 01:58:39.998\nNow, he can keep working, the screens a\nlittle messed up, but he can keep working.\n\n2112\n01:58:39.998 --> 01:58:43.410\nHe did get a message,\nletting him know the shutdown was coming.\n\n2113\n01:58:43.410 --> 01:58:46.240\nAnd if I take a look at Tom,\nhe got a message too,\n\n2114\n01:58:46.240 --> 01:58:48.520\nhis web browser's a little messed up.\n\n2115\n01:58:48.520 --> 01:58:52.630\nBut it's because he got that system\nmessage right there on his screen, and\n\n2116\n01:58:52.630 --> 01:58:56.090\nif he refreshes the screen a bit,\nthere we go, it kind of fixes and\n\n2117\n01:58:56.090 --> 01:58:57.090\nthen you've got it.\n\n2118\n01:58:57.090 --> 01:59:00.088\nAnd then I think I was just in a terminal,\nwasn't, I?\n\n2119\n01:59:00.088 --> 01:59:01.568\nYeah, so I just get a terminal message.\n\n2120\n01:59:01.568 --> 01:59:04.140\nI can keep working, but now I know,\nhey, I've got five minutes.\n\n2121\n01:59:04.140 --> 01:59:05.328\nI need to get this stuff done.\n\n2122\n01:59:05.328 --> 01:59:09.907\nAnd it's gonna continue to send me little\nmessages every now and then, reminding me,\n\n2123\n01:59:09.907 --> 01:59:12.495\nuntil the system actually reboots,\nall right?\n\n2124\n01:59:12.495 --> 01:59:14.908\nSo that's one way to go about it,\n\n2125\n01:59:14.908 --> 01:59:19.570\nwe can also cancel the shutdown,\nI forgot something.\n\n2126\n01:59:19.570 --> 01:59:23.531\n[LAUGH] The shutdown command,\nit's a non-interactive command, but\n\n2127\n01:59:23.531 --> 01:59:26.450\nonce you run it,\nit stays active in your session.\n\n2128\n01:59:26.450 --> 01:59:28.950\nAnd so, you're now kind of locked, right?\n\n2129\n01:59:28.950 --> 01:59:32.660\nIf I hit Ctrl+C, it abort the shutdown.\n\n2130\n01:59:32.660 --> 01:59:37.340\nBut, what if I wanna que up a shutdown and\ncontinue to use up myself.\n\n2131\n01:59:37.340 --> 01:59:40.430\nThen, what I should have done was\nstuck an ampersand in the end of it.\n\n2132\n01:59:40.430 --> 01:59:42.300\nSo, that it will run in the background,\nright?\n\n2133\n01:59:42.300 --> 01:59:46.650\nAnd in that way, I initiate the shutdown\nand now I can keep working, right?\n\n2134\n01:59:46.650 --> 01:59:51.510\nAnd I have five minutes to get my stuff\ndone before the shutdown happens, okay?\n\n2135\n01:59:53.580 --> 01:59:58.794\nNow if I want to abort, I can't do Ctrl+C\nanymore cuz I'm out of the command,\n\n2136\n01:59:58.794 --> 02:00:02.048\nbut I can run shutdown -c and\nthat means cancel.\n\n2137\n02:00:02.048 --> 02:00:06.103\nAnd that'll cancel the scheduled shutdown,\nso there it goes, Shutdown cancelled,\n\n2138\n02:00:06.103 --> 02:00:06.668\nall right?\n\n2139\n02:00:06.668 --> 02:00:10.818\nAnd any user with root access\ncan stop the shutdown.\n\n2140\n02:00:10.818 --> 02:00:13.878\nSo if somebody's in another window and\nthey get this message, right?\n\n2141\n02:00:13.878 --> 02:00:17.218\nSo if I do a shutdown 5 and\n\n2142\n02:00:20.658 --> 02:00:26.376\nGet ready, we are shutting down.\n\n2143\n02:00:26.376 --> 02:00:30.020\nAll right,\nit didn't take my little message.\n\n2144\n02:00:30.020 --> 02:00:31.517\nWhat's wrong with my syntax?\n\n2145\n02:00:31.517 --> 02:00:33.698\nTIME [MESSAGE].\n\n2146\n02:00:33.698 --> 02:00:37.173\nYou know what,\nit's that exclamation point.\n\n2147\n02:00:37.173 --> 02:00:39.479\nAll right, let me do that again.\n\n2148\n02:00:39.479 --> 02:00:41.464\nI thought I would type a qt message.\n\n2149\n02:00:41.464 --> 02:00:42.439\nThat turned out to be bad.\n\n2150\n02:00:48.371 --> 02:00:49.010\nThere we go.\n\n2151\n02:00:49.010 --> 02:00:52.200\nSo now notice the message,\nget ready, we are shutting down.\n\n2152\n02:00:52.200 --> 02:00:54.300\nWe can put in whatever message we want.\n\n2153\n02:00:54.300 --> 02:00:55.757\nSo I just kick that off over here.\n\n2154\n02:00:55.757 --> 02:00:57.648\nNow let's say that I'm\nover here working and\n\n2155\n02:00:57.648 --> 02:01:00.355\nall of the sudden I get this\nmessage that we're gonna shutdown.\n\n2156\n02:01:00.355 --> 02:01:02.010\nI'm like, no, I'm busy.\n\n2157\n02:01:02.010 --> 02:01:04.020\nThey didn't check with me first, right?\n\n2158\n02:01:04.020 --> 02:01:08.480\nWell, if I have root privileges,\nthen I can go in and\n\n2159\n02:01:08.480 --> 02:01:12.580\ndo a shutdown -c and\ncancel the shutdown, and so\n\n2160\n02:01:12.580 --> 02:01:15.912\nnow it's stopped and it's not going\nto execute, so we can do that.\n\n2161\n02:01:15.912 --> 02:01:18.217\nNow actually, you know what,\nit might not do it here, cuz I ran it.\n\n2162\n02:01:18.217 --> 02:01:19.470\nNo, it did, okay.\n\n2163\n02:01:19.470 --> 02:01:21.380\nI didn't know,\nsince I ran it interactively and\n\n2164\n02:01:21.380 --> 02:01:22.850\ndidn't stick it in the background,\nI wasn't sure.\n\n2165\n02:01:22.850 --> 02:01:25.540\nBut yeah, it did.\nSo I can see shutdown cancelled, and\n\n2166\n02:01:25.540 --> 02:01:26.720\nthere we go.\n\n2167\n02:01:26.720 --> 02:01:28.600\nSo root users can cancel the shutdown.\n\n2168\n02:01:31.130 --> 02:01:32.220\nAll right, few other things.\n\n2169\n02:01:32.220 --> 02:01:36.542\nIf we do shutdown down -r, right?\n\n2170\n02:01:36.542 --> 02:01:39.480\nThat's gonna shut us down and do a reboot.\n\n2171\n02:01:39.480 --> 02:01:42.950\nAnd so if I run that,\nI have to give it a time, right?\n\n2172\n02:01:42.950 --> 02:01:46.050\nIt's gonna do a reboot instead\nof a power off, all right?\n\n2173\n02:01:46.050 --> 02:01:49.410\nAnd when you do it, you need to specify a\ntime if you want it to be one minute out,\n\n2174\n02:01:49.410 --> 02:01:50.020\nfive minutes out.\n\n2175\n02:01:50.020 --> 02:01:50.678\nThe time is in minutes.\n\n2176\n02:01:50.678 --> 02:01:55.089\nIf you want it to be right now, there's\nan alias for that which is the word now.\n\n2177\n02:01:55.089 --> 02:01:58.248\nIf you say shutdown now,\nit'll turn off, right?\n\n2178\n02:01:58.248 --> 02:02:00.791\nIf I just do that, shut down now, right?\n\n2179\n02:02:00.791 --> 02:02:03.120\nIt immediately shuts down.\n\n2180\n02:02:03.120 --> 02:02:04.770\nThe other users, they're out of luck.\n\n2181\n02:02:04.770 --> 02:02:08.228\nThey didn't have a chance.\nSystem is going for maintenance right now.\n\n2182\n02:02:08.228 --> 02:02:11.770\nYep, it just goes down and\nthat's that, right?\n\n2183\n02:02:11.770 --> 02:02:17.770\nSo, no warning and notice it's sending\nme into single user mode, okay?\n\n2184\n02:02:17.770 --> 02:02:20.413\nWhy is it doing that?\nI didn't tell it INIT one.\n\n2185\n02:02:20.413 --> 02:02:21.528\nI told it to shut down.\n\n2186\n02:02:21.528 --> 02:02:25.813\nWell, that's because the shutdown command\nby itself goes into single user mode.\n\n2187\n02:02:25.813 --> 02:02:28.122\nAnd once you're in single user mode,\n\n2188\n02:02:28.122 --> 02:02:32.535\nwhich actually is probably mad at me\nnow cuz I had more than one terminal.\n\n2189\n02:02:32.535 --> 02:02:33.639\nYep, this one did it.\n\n2190\n02:02:33.639 --> 02:02:37.560\nIt was which ever terminal I had up\nbecomes the single user mode one.\n\n2191\n02:02:37.560 --> 02:02:40.580\nSo this is the one that just flipped.\n\n2192\n02:02:40.580 --> 02:02:43.826\nSo anyhow, so it's going into\nsingle user mode, all right?\n\n2193\n02:02:43.826 --> 02:02:46.255\nThat's the default function of shutdown.\n\n2194\n02:02:46.255 --> 02:02:49.810\nShutdown'll take you into single user\nmode and that may not be what you want.\n\n2195\n02:02:49.810 --> 02:02:51.240\nOnce you're in single user mode though,\n\n2196\n02:02:51.240 --> 02:02:55.610\nyou can power the system off\nthe rest of the way by typing halt.\n\n2197\n02:02:55.610 --> 02:02:59.740\nHalt says, that's it, go ahead and shut\ndown, and power off the system if you can,\n\n2198\n02:02:59.740 --> 02:03:00.860\nall right?\n\n2199\n02:03:00.860 --> 02:03:05.360\nSo I'll type halt, and here we go,\nshutting down the rest of the way.\n\n2200\n02:03:05.360 --> 02:03:09.195\nAnd this should power my system down,\nassuming it's supported.\n\n2201\n02:03:09.195 --> 02:03:10.415\nThere we go, all right.\n\n2202\n02:03:10.415 --> 02:03:12.875\nI'm in a virtual machine, so\nI get my little start screen back up.\n\n2203\n02:03:14.595 --> 02:03:15.575\nAll right, so\n\n2204\n02:03:15.575 --> 02:03:19.192\nit took me two steps there because\nshutdown took me to single user mode.\n\n2205\n02:03:19.192 --> 02:03:22.122\nAnd that, like I said,\nthat may not be what we want.\n\n2206\n02:03:22.122 --> 02:03:25.612\nSo if we wanna shut down and actually have\nit power off, that's where we need to do\n\n2207\n02:03:25.612 --> 02:03:32.530\na dash lowercase h dash capital H or a\ndash, shoot, what's the other one, dash P.\n\n2208\n02:03:32.530 --> 02:03:37.390\nTo actually say power down,\nbased on what our system supports.\n\n2209\n02:03:37.390 --> 02:03:39.020\nMost systems support all three,\n\n2210\n02:03:39.020 --> 02:03:43.180\nso I usually just kinds of\ndefault to shutdown -h.\n\n2211\n02:03:43.180 --> 02:03:46.322\nSo if I do shutdown -h now,\n\n2212\n02:03:46.322 --> 02:03:52.100\nthat means shutdown and\nhalt right now, okay?\n\n2213\n02:03:52.100 --> 02:03:54.033\nSo don't bother with single user mode.\n\n2214\n02:03:54.033 --> 02:03:58.410\nAnd if I run that, there it goes shutting\ndown and we should see it halt the system.\n\n2215\n02:04:01.696 --> 02:04:02.705\nAnytime now.\n\n2216\n02:04:02.705 --> 02:04:04.355\n[LAUGH] There we go.\n\n2217\n02:04:04.355 --> 02:04:07.455\nSee, it's actually halting the system and\nthen off we go.\n\n2218\n02:04:07.455 --> 02:04:09.035\nNow, if that doesn't work.\n\n2219\n02:04:09.035 --> 02:04:11.780\nI used to see this on\nlaptops all the time.\n\n2220\n02:04:11.780 --> 02:04:14.545\nIt would halt and then on the screen,\nit would just sit there.\n\n2221\n02:04:14.545 --> 02:04:18.970\nDisplaying the Linux halt statement, and\nit would sit there forever and run your\n\n2222\n02:04:18.970 --> 02:04:22.730\nbattery dead, and you'd be really angry\nwhen you got to wherever you were going.\n\n2223\n02:04:22.730 --> 02:04:25.430\nSo that's where some of the other\noptions come into play.\n\n2224\n02:04:25.430 --> 02:04:26.910\nAnd so on a lot of older laptops,\n\n2225\n02:04:26.910 --> 02:04:31.000\nthey had to do shutdown -p to tell it,\nI actually want you to power off.\n\n2226\n02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:33.767\nDon't just freeze, actually go\nthe rest of the way and power off.\n\n2227\n02:04:33.767 --> 02:04:37.078\nBut if your system's not supported,\nthen you may not have that option,\n\n2228\n02:04:37.078 --> 02:04:38.443\nyou might not be able to do it.\n\n2229\n02:04:43.233 --> 02:04:47.150\nAll right, so shutdown-r will do a reboot.\n\n2230\n02:04:47.150 --> 02:04:51.210\nThere is an alias for that also,\nwhich is the reboot command, right?\n\n2231\n02:04:51.210 --> 02:04:56.100\nWhich is the same thing as shutdown -r if\nI pull up that file, or the man file for\n\n2232\n02:04:56.100 --> 02:04:57.940\nthat, you can see reboot.\n\n2233\n02:04:57.940 --> 02:04:59.433\nIt doesn't take a ton of options.\n\n2234\n02:04:59.433 --> 02:05:04.729\n-force, -poweroff, -wtmp only, -reboot,\n\n2235\n02:05:04.729 --> 02:05:12.870\n-force, that's really just like\nbasically forcing your system to reboot.\n\n2236\n02:05:12.870 --> 02:05:14.030\nI hate to use the word force,\n\n2237\n02:05:14.030 --> 02:05:16.670\nI'm having a hard time thinking\nof an alternate word there.\n\n2238\n02:05:16.670 --> 02:05:19.200\nBut basically it skips over\nthe shutdown process and\n\n2239\n02:05:19.200 --> 02:05:20.950\njust says no matter what, reboot.\n\n2240\n02:05:20.950 --> 02:05:22.290\nJust do it.\n\n2241\n02:05:22.290 --> 02:05:24.200\nPower off, on the other hand,\nmakes it halt.\n\n2242\n02:05:24.200 --> 02:05:25.555\nAnd that's basically shut down.\n\n2243\n02:05:25.555 --> 02:05:29.107\nReboot -p is really\nthe same as shutdown -p.\n\n2244\n02:05:29.107 --> 02:05:32.446\nSo, we don't normally feed all\nthat much into the reboot command.\n\n2245\n02:05:32.446 --> 02:05:36.522\nWhen you look at it,\nyou don't even have to give it a time.\n\n2246\n02:05:36.522 --> 02:05:39.239\nIf you just type reboot,\nit's going to reboot.\n\n2247\n02:05:39.239 --> 02:05:43.590\nSo, if I punch that in,\nthere it goes and it's rebooting.\n\n2248\n02:05:43.590 --> 02:05:46.750\nIf you wanna reboot with a timer,\nyou need to do shutdown -r, and\n\n2249\n02:05:46.750 --> 02:05:47.530\nthen you can give it a time.\n\n2250\n02:05:50.150 --> 02:05:51.360\nSpeaking of time,\n\n2251\n02:05:51.360 --> 02:05:54.780\nI mentioned how you can set it to\nfive minutes from now or whatever.\n\n2252\n02:05:54.780 --> 02:05:57.290\nYou can set it to a specific\ntime if you want.\n\n2253\n02:05:57.290 --> 02:06:00.880\nMaybe I made a change to my system,\nand I know it needs a reboot, but\n\n2254\n02:06:00.880 --> 02:06:03.280\nI don't wanna do it in the middle of\nthe day while people are in the system.\n\n2255\n02:06:04.350 --> 02:06:07.700\nSo maybe I want the computer to reboot\nat 3:00 AM, when nobody's in there,\n\n2256\n02:06:07.700 --> 02:06:08.200\nall right?\n\n2257\n02:06:08.200 --> 02:06:10.522\nWell, I don't want to come\nup to the office at 3:00 AM.\n\n2258\n02:06:10.522 --> 02:06:13.358\nHeck, I don't even wanna wake up and\nremote in at 3:00 AM,\n\n2259\n02:06:13.358 --> 02:06:14.760\nI just want it to be automatic.\n\n2260\n02:06:14.760 --> 02:06:20.571\nSo what you can do is you\ncan run shutdown -r and\n\n2261\n02:06:20.571 --> 02:06:24.003\nthen specify 3:00 AM.\n\n2262\n02:06:24.003 --> 02:06:29.135\nOkay, so I'm gonna put 03:00,\nit does use the military time clock or\n\n2263\n02:06:29.135 --> 02:06:33.600\nthe universal 24 hour time code,\nwhatever we wanna call it.\n\n2264\n02:06:33.600 --> 02:06:36.670\nSo I'm saying go ahead and\nreboot at 3:00 AM.\n\n2265\n02:06:36.670 --> 02:06:39.530\nAnd I'll stick my ampersand on\nthe end to run it in the background.\n\n2266\n02:06:39.530 --> 02:06:41.367\nAnd now it's scheduling that reboot.\n\n2267\n02:06:41.367 --> 02:06:45.407\nThe system is going down for\na reboot in 743 minutes.\n\n2268\n02:06:45.407 --> 02:06:48.309\nSo that's in a little while.\n\n2269\n02:06:48.309 --> 02:06:48.902\n>> Yeah.\n\n2270\n02:06:48.902 --> 02:06:54.243\n>> So, now I can wait 743 minutes.\n\n2271\n02:06:54.243 --> 02:06:54.823\n>> There you go.\n\n2272\n02:06:54.823 --> 02:06:55.462\n>> Maybe not.\n\n2273\n02:06:55.462 --> 02:06:59.200\nAll right, so [LAUGH] I don't have\nthat kind of patience on my hands but\n\n2274\n02:06:59.200 --> 02:07:02.730\nyou can schedule for a time and\nthat's a really nice thing.\n\n2275\n02:07:02.730 --> 02:07:06.460\nJust remember you can always do\nshutdown -c and that'll cancel it.\n\n2276\n02:07:06.460 --> 02:07:10.440\nYou cannot schedule more than one\nshutdown at the same time, all right?\n\n2277\n02:07:10.440 --> 02:07:12.743\nIf you want that,\nyou'll have to create Cron jobs, and\n\n2278\n02:07:12.743 --> 02:07:15.746\nwe haven't learned about Cron yet,\nso we'll just say you can't do it.\n\n2279\n02:07:15.746 --> 02:07:19.424\n[LAUGH] There's always\na way to do something.\n\n2280\n02:07:19.424 --> 02:07:20.830\nBut using the shutdown command,\n\n2281\n02:07:20.830 --> 02:07:22.990\nyou can only have one\nshutdown scheduled at a time.\n\n2282\n02:07:24.390 --> 02:07:27.314\nAll right, another useful command.\n\n2283\n02:07:27.314 --> 02:07:30.961\nWe talked about the file\nsystem health check, fsck.\n\n2284\n02:07:30.961 --> 02:07:34.945\nAnd how when you reboot after\na certain amount of mounts or\n\n2285\n02:07:34.945 --> 02:07:40.093\nafter a certain amount of time,\nit'll check the file system for errors.\n\n2286\n02:07:40.093 --> 02:07:46.400\nAnd we can run fsck-a and it'll check all\nof our systems, unless they're mounted.\n\n2287\n02:07:46.400 --> 02:07:52.050\nSo what if we want to force a file\nsystem check of our root mount point,\n\n2288\n02:07:52.050 --> 02:07:53.630\nwhich is always mounted, right?\n\n2289\n02:07:53.630 --> 02:07:58.496\nWell, for that,\nthere's a special shutdown command\n\n2290\n02:07:58.496 --> 02:08:03.704\nthat we can use,\nyou can do a shutdown -r -F, all right?\n\n2291\n02:08:03.704 --> 02:08:05.280\nThat says reboot and\n\n2292\n02:08:05.280 --> 02:08:09.845\non the next boot, force fsck to run,\nand it'll check the hard drive.\n\n2293\n02:08:09.845 --> 02:08:12.262\nSo that's a good way to\nforce that check to happen,\n\n2294\n02:08:12.262 --> 02:08:15.315\nand ensure that your drives\nare healthy if you're not certain.\n\n2295\n02:08:15.315 --> 02:08:18.490\nBecause it does it at boot time,\nthey can catch it before all those drives\n\n2296\n02:08:18.490 --> 02:08:21.889\nare mounted or it can catch it while\nthe drives are mounted read only, right?\n\n2297\n02:08:21.889 --> 02:08:24.129\nSo if I run that, I didn't specify a time.\n\n2298\n02:08:24.129 --> 02:08:28.735\nSo if I run that, shutdown -r -F now.\n\n2299\n02:08:28.735 --> 02:08:34.380\nNow it's gonna reboot and when it boots,\nit should run the file system check.\n\n2300\n02:08:34.380 --> 02:08:37.919\nNow my file system's only 20 gigs in size,\nit's pretty small.\n\n2301\n02:08:37.919 --> 02:08:40.403\nSo the check will happen pretty fast.\n\n2302\n02:08:42.668 --> 02:08:44.966\nBut, let's see, here it goes.\n\n2303\n02:08:44.966 --> 02:08:49.730\nAnd CentOS is gonna cover it\nup with its crazy blue line.\n\n2304\n02:08:49.730 --> 02:08:50.770\nWhich don't we hit escape?\n\n2305\n02:08:50.770 --> 02:08:51.580\nThere we go.\n\n2306\n02:08:51.580 --> 02:08:54.290\nAnd it's already gone by I just missed it,\nbut yeah,\n\n2307\n02:08:54.290 --> 02:08:56.430\nI did the file system check\nright there above that.\n\n2308\n02:08:56.430 --> 02:09:00.170\nI didn't hit escape in time to\nactually see the verbose boot.\n\n2309\n02:09:00.170 --> 02:09:04.180\nAnd I don't think I mentioned that\nin the show, is that a lot of\n\n2310\n02:09:04.180 --> 02:09:09.170\nLinux systems have pretty startup screens\nnow, like Ubuntu and Red Hat and stuff.\n\n2311\n02:09:09.170 --> 02:09:12.190\nAnd if you press escape on your keyboard,\n\n2312\n02:09:12.190 --> 02:09:13.960\nit'll make it where you\ncan see what's going on.\n\n2313\n02:09:13.960 --> 02:09:15.620\nLet's do that again.\n\n2314\n02:09:15.620 --> 02:09:19.760\nAnd I just want you guys to see that it\nis actually checking that file system.\n\n2315\n02:09:19.760 --> 02:09:20.761\nSo we'll let it reboot.\n\n2316\n02:09:24.651 --> 02:09:26.280\nOops.\n\n2317\n02:09:26.280 --> 02:09:30.050\nPressed too many keys as I am won't to do.\n\n2318\n02:09:30.050 --> 02:09:30.870\nThere we go.\n\n2319\n02:09:30.870 --> 02:09:32.600\nAll right.\nSo here it goes booting up and\n\n2320\n02:09:32.600 --> 02:09:35.410\nyou're welcome to CentOS and\nit's starting to recognize my hardware and\n\n2321\n02:09:35.410 --> 02:09:38.820\nthere's the file system check right\nthere and it's already off the screen.\n\n2322\n02:09:38.820 --> 02:09:43.170\nYou know, 20 gigs is very, very small so\nit's able to check those very quickly and\n\n2323\n02:09:43.170 --> 02:09:45.370\nthen move on.\n\n2324\n02:09:45.370 --> 02:09:48.160\nI did have one failure there for\nHGFS which I'm not using.\n\n2325\n02:09:48.160 --> 02:09:51.230\nI'm not sure why it's even starting that,\nmust be part of the default install.\n\n2326\n02:09:52.830 --> 02:09:54.000\nLet's see, what else do we have?\n\n2327\n02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:55.880\nI think that's really about it.\n\n2328\n02:09:58.850 --> 02:10:00.600\n>> Yeah.\n>> Yeah, that's about it.\n\n2329\n02:10:00.600 --> 02:10:04.910\nSo just remember, like doing a shutdown\nreally is like calling init zero.\n\n2330\n02:10:04.910 --> 02:10:07.020\nI guess I could do that,\njust for the fun of it,\n\n2331\n02:10:07.020 --> 02:10:09.530\nsince this is not a production system.\n\n2332\n02:10:09.530 --> 02:10:12.820\nI wouldn't do it in a production system,\nbut if you do init zero,\n\n2333\n02:10:12.820 --> 02:10:17.260\nthat's basically saying shut down and\ndo it right now, and\n\n2334\n02:10:17.260 --> 02:10:19.500\nit's not necessarily gonna do\nit in the cleanest manner.\n\n2335\n02:10:19.500 --> 02:10:23.800\nSo when it goes through,\nit will at least run the rc0.d scripts,\n\n2336\n02:10:23.800 --> 02:10:25.910\nwhich tells it to gracefully shut down.\n\n2337\n02:10:25.910 --> 02:10:28.347\nSo it'll churn through,\nand that'll knock it out.\n\n2338\n02:10:30.386 --> 02:10:34.557\nAll right, well I think that pretty\nmuch sums it up for the boot process and\n\n2339\n02:10:34.557 --> 02:10:35.510\nthe run levels.\n\n2340\n02:10:35.510 --> 02:10:39.640\nAnd I think you guys can start to see\nwhy I wanted to save that for the end.\n\n2341\n02:10:39.640 --> 02:10:42.370\nIt didn't necessarily make sense to have\nit in the very beginning when you hadn't\n\n2342\n02:10:42.370 --> 02:10:44.100\nlearned about all the other\nthings that are going on.\n\n2343\n02:10:44.100 --> 02:10:46.310\nSo good knowledge to have there.\n\n2344\n02:10:46.310 --> 02:10:50.940\nThat does wrap up the objectives for\n\n2345\n02:10:50.940 --> 02:10:55.670\nthe first exam, but remember that\nthe Linux plus certification is two exams.\n\n2346\n02:10:55.670 --> 02:10:59.560\nSo, stay tuned, we're gonna film\nthe episodes for the second exam starting,\n\n2347\n02:10:59.560 --> 02:11:01.060\nwell, if you're watching live,\nwe'll start them tomorrow.\n\n2348\n02:11:01.060 --> 02:11:03.370\nIf you're watching this recorded,\nthen they should already be done.\n\n2349\n02:11:03.370 --> 02:11:07.670\nSo we'll be jumping into those but\nif you are focused and\n\n2350\n02:11:07.670 --> 02:11:09.800\ndialed into that first exam at this point.\n\n2351\n02:11:09.800 --> 02:11:11.340\n>> Yeah.\n>> We've covered everything that is on\n\n2352\n02:11:11.340 --> 02:11:13.740\nthe objective list so\nwe should be in pretty good shape.\n\n2353\n02:11:14.740 --> 02:11:17.940\nAll right, I do want to remind you guys\nif you do have questions on anything that\n\n2354\n02:11:17.940 --> 02:11:22.510\nwe've covered, well live during\nthe show you can go to itpro.tv/live.\n\n2355\n02:11:22.510 --> 02:11:24.750\nYou'll see our chat room\nright beneath the video.\n\n2356\n02:11:24.750 --> 02:11:26.190\nYou can post

00:00:34.589\nAll right, good morning.\n\n5\n00:00:34.589 --> 00:00:35.213\nGood afternoon.\n\n6\n00:00:35.213 --> 00:00:36.213\nAnd good evening.\n\n7\n00:00:36.213 --> 00:00:38.838\nAnd welcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n8\n00:00:38.838 --> 00:00:40.338\nI'm your host Don Pezet.\n\n9\n00:00:40.338 --> 00:00:42.329\nToday, back again with Don Pezet,\nhow's it going Don?\n\n10\n00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:43.463\n>> Yeah, pretty good, pretty good.\n\n11\n00:00:43.463 --> 00:00:47.136\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I guess it's white shirt day,\n\n12\n00:00:47.136 --> 00:00:48.630\ncompletely unplanned.\n\n13\n00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:53.581\nI'm sure Ronnie's having a field day\nwith those twinsy comments, but yeah,\n\n14\n00:00:53.581 --> 00:00:55.710\nas he hollers from the side.\n\n15\n00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.946\n>> If we were professional video people,\n\n16\n00:00:57.946 --> 00:01:01.754\nwe would probably coordinate our\n[LAUGH] wardrobe a little better.\n\n17\n00:01:01.754 --> 00:01:06.275\nBut we're IT people and we don't care what\nwe wear, no matter how stupid it looks.\n\n18\n00:01:06.275 --> 00:01:11.650\n[LAUGH] So, today we are back again\nwith another episode of Linux Plus.\n\n19\n00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:16.110\nI know the last few episodes may not have\nbeen the most exciting because you can\n\n20\n00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.580\nonly stare at command line utilities so\nlong before you go absolutely crazy.\n\n21\n00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.880\nSo today, what we're gonna do, is we're\ngonna change it up a little bit and\n\n22\n00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.580\ntalk about managing the hard\ndrives in a Linux system.\n\n23\n00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:30.546\n>> Yeah, it's still command\nline stuff though, right?\n\n24\n00:01:30.546 --> 00:01:31.921\n>> Well, yeah.\n\n25\n00:01:31.921 --> 00:01:33.962\n>> In the end?\n>> In the end it is, but,\n\n26\n00:01:33.962 --> 00:01:34.728\n>> I didn't know,\n\n27\n00:01:34.728 --> 00:01:38.561\ncuz we had discussed before, I didn't know\nif you were gonna whip something out and\n\n28\n00:01:38.561 --> 00:01:40.780\nhave, I don't know,\nnot command line stuff.\n\n29\n00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:41.962\n>> We could, but yeah.\n\n30\n00:01:41.962 --> 00:01:43.046\nOn the exam,\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n31\n00:01:43.046 --> 00:01:44.894\n>> They do focus on the command line\n\n32\n00:01:44.894 --> 00:01:47.980\nexecution of all this stuff,\nso we have to have that.\n\n33\n00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:50.220\nBut in the last episode we did,\n\n34\n00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.720\nit was like opening a fire hose of\ncommand line utility, just tons of them.\n\n35\n00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.345\nWhereas in this show, I think we\nare gonna have, I don't know, eight or\n\n36\n00:01:56.345 --> 00:01:57.087\nnine all together.\n\n37\n00:01:57.087 --> 00:01:58.725\nLittle commands that we use, so\n\n38\n00:01:58.725 --> 00:02:01.463\nit's definitely not as bad\nas some of the other ones.\n\n39\n00:02:01.463 --> 00:02:03.360\nNothing bad,\nthere's always something to learn.\n\n40\n00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.760\n>> Well, still new ones though, right?\n\n41\n00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:05.504\n>> Yeah.\n>> Still new ones\n\n42\n00:02:05.504 --> 00:02:06.953\n>> Ones we haven't seen before,\n\n43\n00:02:06.953 --> 00:02:08.129\nat least not on the show.\n\n44\n00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:09.890\n>> Right, nice\n>> All right,\n\n45\n00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.150\nwell let's get started here so\nfirst things first.\n\n46\n00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.840\nIf you wanna run Linux on your system,\nit's gotta be stored somewhere.\n\n47\n00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.664\nAnd if you have a live CD, maybe it's\nright there on that live CD, and\n\n48\n00:02:19.664 --> 00:02:20.755\nthat's all you've got.\n\n49\n00:02:20.755 --> 00:02:22.755\nOr maybe you've booted from a USB key.\n\n50\n00:02:22.755 --> 00:02:24.297\nBut the majority of the time,\n\n51\n00:02:24.297 --> 00:02:27.980\nyou're booting from a hard drive\ninside of your own system.\n\n52\n00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.215\nNow Linux has excellent support for\nhard drive controllers,\n\n53\n00:02:31.215 --> 00:02:34.550\nRAID controllers that are out there,\nfor most storage types.\n\n54\n00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.760\nSo Linux, when you booted it, regardless\nof your distro, whether it was CentOS or\n\n55\n00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.420\nDebian or whatever, it more than likely\nautomatically detected your hard drive.\n\n56\n00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.500\nAnd during the install,\nit gave you the ability to format and\n\n57\n00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.740\npartition out one drive and move through.\n\n58\n00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.000\nNow if you did an advanced install,\n\n59\n00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.660\nyou could have partitioned and\nmanaged more than one drive.\n\n60\n00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.610\nBut most of us just do the normal install,\n\n61\n00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:59.660\ncuz you end up with one hard drive rocking\nand ready to go by the end of the install.\n\n62\n00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.730\nWell, what if you have\nmore than one hard drive?\n\n63\n00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:03.410\nHow do we get that setup?\n\n64\n00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:05.700\nHow do we even know if we have\nmore than one hard drive?\n\n65\n00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.300\nHow do we even know if Linux saw our\nhard drives in the first place, right?\n\n66\n00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:10.360\nSo that's where I wanna start.\n\n67\n00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.380\nI wanna go back to the very beginning.\n\n68\n00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:18.739\nWell, in episode number 1,\nI made a comment about how in Linux,\n\n69\n00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:21.961\nmost things are represented as a file.\n\n70\n00:03:21.961 --> 00:03:23.998\nThey might be a physical hard drive or\nwhatever, but\n\n71\n00:03:23.998 --> 00:03:26.470\nmost things are represented as a file.\n\n72\n00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:30.146\nSo our files, well,\nthose are represented as files, but\n\n73\n00:03:30.146 --> 00:03:34.587\nour hardware is all nested on a folder\non our hard drive or in our shell.\n\n74\n00:03:34.587 --> 00:03:39.003\nWhich is under /dev, and\nthat's just short for devices.\n\n75\n00:03:39.003 --> 00:03:44.790\nAnd if we browse into /dev, we can see\nall the stuff that Linux has detected.\n\n76\n00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.630\nSo let's take a look at\nthat on my machine here.\n\n77\n00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:49.640\nAnd I am logged in as a root user so\n\n78\n00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.270\nthat I have the ability to mess with\nsome of this stuff a regular user won't.\n\n79\n00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:56.810\nI'm just gonna change\ndirectory into /dev and\n\n80\n00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:00.770\nI'm gonna pull up a list\nof what's in there, okay?\n\n81\n00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:03.254\nAnd what you're gonna\nsee is a bunch of stuff.\n\n82\n00:04:03.254 --> 00:04:07.990\nYou're gonna see things like your CPU,\nyour processor, represented as a file.\n\n83\n00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:11.087\nYou're gonna see mem,\nthat's your memory represented as a file.\n\n84\n00:04:11.087 --> 00:04:15.015\nYou're gonna see all these ttys,\nright, for us to be able to log in and\n\n85\n00:04:15.015 --> 00:04:16.298\nwork with the system.\n\n86\n00:04:16.298 --> 00:04:19.450\nNow, in CentOS, you'll see,\nwhat is it, 64 ttys,\n\n87\n00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:22.190\nbut only 6 of them are actually activated.\n\n88\n00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:25.100\nThe other ones get mapped to\nthings like SSH connections, and\n\n89\n00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:26.570\nTelnet when they come in.\n\n90\n00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:29.370\nYou'll see USB monitors, VGA arbiters,\n\n91\n00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.000\nyou'll see all sorts of\ncrazy things in here.\n\n92\n00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.587\nWhere are the hard drives?\n\n93\n00:04:33.587 --> 00:04:37.569\nWell, back in the old IDE and ATA days,\n\n94\n00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:43.570\nhard drives are always designated\nas HD and then a letter.\n\n95\n00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:46.129\nHDA, HDB, HDC and so\non all the way to HDZ.\n\n96\n00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:48.650\nSo, you could have 26\ndifferent drives there.\n\n97\n00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:50.630\nAnd that was kinda how it ran.\n\n98\n00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:57.060\nAnd SCSI drives were identified as SDA,\nSDB, all the way through SDZ.\n\n99\n00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:00.220\nNow, as time went on,\nIDE drives kind of went away and\n\n100\n00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:05.030\ngot replaced by SATA, Serial ATA,\nwhatever ATA stands for.\n\n101\n00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:06.880\n[LAUGH] Do you remember\nwhat ATA stands for?\n\n102\n00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:10.125\n>> You know as soon as you said that,\nI was like, okay, let's see,\n\n103\n00:05:10.125 --> 00:05:14.222\nI could throw a cool acronym like-\n>> Asynchronous Transfer Attack.\n\n104\n00:05:14.222 --> 00:05:15.930\n>> Yeah.\n>> I don't know, whatever it stands for.\n\n105\n00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:20.316\nSo, [LAUGH] SATA drives have kinda\nreplaced, Serial ATA, and so\n\n106\n00:05:20.316 --> 00:05:23.502\nthose have kinda taken the place of IDE.\n\n107\n00:05:23.502 --> 00:05:27.170\nAnd Serial ATA, you only have one\ndrive per channel with it and\n\n108\n00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:31.720\nso you kind of end up a lot like SCSI,\nwhere with SCSI drives,\n\n109\n00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:35.710\nyou had SCSI ID numbers, 0 through\n15 that would identify your drives.\n\n110\n00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:40.450\nAnd on SATA you have SATA ID numbers,\nso you might have SATA disk 0,\n\n111\n00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:41.730\ndisk 1 and so on.\n\n112\n00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:43.470\nSince they're addressed the same way,\n\n113\n00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:47.440\nthey just kinda drop the old HD\nnomenclature and switch to SD.\n\n114\n00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:55.610\nSo, when I look at this list right here,\nI can see sda, sda1, sda2, sdb, sdc, sdd.\n\n115\n00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:57.460\nThose are my hard drives.\n\n116\n00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:03.940\nAnd so I can see my system has detected\nfour had drives sda, sdb, sdc, and sdd.\n\n117\n00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:09.730\nNow, what are these numbers\nafterwards sda1, sda2, okay?\n\n118\n00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:11.570\nThose are partitions.\n\n119\n00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:15.530\nOn drive sda1, that's my first drive,\ndrive a, all right?\n\n120\n00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:16.900\nThere are two partitions.\n\n121\n00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:18.730\nPartition one and partition two.\n\n122\n00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:21.040\nAnd drive B there's no partitions.\n\n123\n00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:24.745\nIt's a completely blank disc\nwith absolutely nothing on it.\n\n124\n00:06:24.745 --> 00:06:27.900\nsdc has one partition and\nsdd has one partition, so\n\n125\n00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:30.160\nthat's what those numbered\nentities are after that.\n\n126\n00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:32.688\nIf I want to refer to\na specific partition,\n\n127\n00:06:32.688 --> 00:06:35.250\nif I'm gonna format it,\nI need to use that.\n\n128\n00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:37.620\nBut if I want to work with\na disc to create a partition,\n\n129\n00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:39.720\nI have to point to the disk, itself.\n\n130\n00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:41.380\nSo we'll see those in there.\n\n131\n00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:44.330\n>> So then these disks here,\nthey don't start at 0?\n\n132\n00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:46.770\nSo 0 is not the very\nfirst one begins at 1?\n\n133\n00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:47.337\n>> Partitions.\n\n134\n00:06:47.337 --> 00:06:49.550\nPartitions always start at 1, yep.\n\n135\n00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:50.337\nYeah, it's been like that.\n\n136\n00:06:50.337 --> 00:06:52.086\nYou see that in the Windows world even.\n\n137\n00:06:52.086 --> 00:06:54.950\nWhen you look at the disc,\nthey start at 1.\n\n138\n00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:57.390\nAnd the reason is there is\nactually a partition 0,\n\n139\n00:06:57.390 --> 00:07:00.510\nit's the master boot record,\nand so it gets that 0, and so\n\n140\n00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:02.970\nthe partitions that we work\nwith all start with 1.\n\n141\n00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:06.855\nVery unintuitive, cuz we're so\nused to computers starting with 0.\n\n142\n00:07:06.855 --> 00:07:07.879\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n143\n00:07:07.879 --> 00:07:08.921\n>> You'll see other things in here.\n\n144\n00:07:08.921 --> 00:07:12.310\nSome things are off my screen,\nlike CD-ROM is one of them.\n\n145\n00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:15.490\nSo let me just feed this through more.\n\n146\n00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:17.950\nAnd so you can see right there, cdrom.\n\n147\n00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:20.350\nSo if you popped a disk in your\nCD-ROM drive, it'll show up.\n\n148\n00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:24.830\nIf you have more than one CD-ROM drive,\nit'll label those out so you got them.\n\n149\n00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:27.915\nThere's all sorts of crazy stuff in\nhere depending on what it is your\n\n150\n00:07:27.915 --> 00:07:29.115\ngonna work with.\n\n151\n00:07:29.115 --> 00:07:31.671\nPretty much all your hardware\ndevices are represented in here.\n\n152\n00:07:31.671 --> 00:07:33.503\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n153\n00:07:33.503 --> 00:07:35.540\n>> All right, so those are my drives but\n\n154\n00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:38.445\nit doesn’t really tell me much about them,\nright?\n\n155\n00:07:38.445 --> 00:07:41.732\nI assume that Linux is able to see\nthem cuz they show up in here.\n\n156\n00:07:41.732 --> 00:07:46.223\nIf we really wan to be certain, when your\nsystem boots up, it runs through all sorts\n\n157\n00:07:46.223 --> 00:07:50.543\nof hardware detection and it scrolls by\nthe screen really fast when you boot up.\n\n158\n00:07:50.543 --> 00:07:54.661\nSo we don't really see that\nafter we were already booted, so\n\n159\n00:07:54.661 --> 00:08:00.087\nthere's a nice little command we can run,\ndmesg And that will show us, dmesg.\n\n160\n00:08:00.087 --> 00:08:03.390\nAnd it will show us all the hardware\ndetection that when the happen system was\n\n161\n00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:04.700\nbooted, all right.\n\n162\n00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:06.860\nNow, there is a lot of stuff in there.\n\n163\n00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:09.210\nAnd you'll see it is screen after screen,\nafter screen of stuff.\n\n164\n00:08:09.210 --> 00:08:11.435\nLike, if I typed that\ninto the more command.\n\n165\n00:08:11.435 --> 00:08:17.170\nWe'll see it's, just page,\nafter page, after page of stuff.\n\n166\n00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:20.728\nAnd you see it like querying\nall the APX stuff, and\n\n167\n00:08:20.728 --> 00:08:24.730\nquerying your memory,\nyour processor capabilities.\n\n168\n00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:27.236\nThere's ACPI queries going on.\n\n169\n00:08:27.236 --> 00:08:29.056\nAll your PCI cards, right?\n\n170\n00:08:29.056 --> 00:08:31.529\nIt's gotta detect all of\nyour hardware at boot time.\n\n171\n00:08:31.529 --> 00:08:34.873\nAnd there is just a ton in here.\n\n172\n00:08:34.873 --> 00:08:37.241\nI'm getting tired of hitting spacebar.\n\n173\n00:08:37.241 --> 00:08:38.182\nYeah, all right, I'm bored already.\n\n174\n00:08:38.182 --> 00:08:39.169\nLet me quit out of that.\n\n175\n00:08:39.169 --> 00:08:41.131\nSo there's a lot, right?\n\n176\n00:08:41.131 --> 00:08:44.475\nAnd if we wanna see how our\nhard drives were detected.\n\n177\n00:08:44.475 --> 00:08:47.122\nIt's really tough to go through here and\npick it out.\n\n178\n00:08:47.122 --> 00:08:51.360\nAnd so, what I do is, I usually do a grep.\n\n179\n00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:56.400\nAgain, like I grep the text so that it\ncan tell me the information that I want.\n\n180\n00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:59.410\nNow, if you know exactly what\ndrive you're looking for.\n\n181\n00:08:59.410 --> 00:09:04.430\nLike, if you're looking for SDA, and\nyou just wanna see SDAs detection.\n\n182\n00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:10.434\nYou can do dmesg, and\npipe its output into grep,\n\n183\n00:09:10.434 --> 00:09:14.980\nand you can look for SDA, all right?\n\n184\n00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:17.707\nAnd it'll show you every line\nthat includes SDA, right?\n\n185\n00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:20.810\nAnd so when I run that, there it is.\n\n186\n00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:24.560\nThere's SDA being detected, and it gives\nme some information about it, right?\n\n187\n00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:26.860\nIt's a 20 gig disk, right?\n\n188\n00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:28.687\nAnd notice they list it\ntwo different ways, right?\n\n189\n00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:34.900\nThere's gigabytes as they're\nrepresented to us in the computer and\n\n190\n00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:38.570\nthere's gigabytes as they're written\nto the hard drive themselves.\n\n191\n00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:44.070\nSo, it's exactly 20 gigabytes\non the physical disk.\n\n192\n00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:47.910\nBut, with that one it's\nsaying that one byte or\n\n193\n00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:53.004\nit basically it says like,\none kilobyte is 1,000 bytes.\n\n194\n00:09:53.004 --> 00:09:58.126\nBut on the computer,\none kilobyte is 1,024 bytes.\n\n195\n00:09:58.126 --> 00:10:00.390\nThat's why this number is bigger, right?\n\n196\n00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:02.446\nSo we get two different representations.\n\n197\n00:10:02.446 --> 00:10:05.838\nYou notice that like if you go to the\nstore and you buy a 500 gig hard drive,\n\n198\n00:10:05.838 --> 00:10:09.504\nyou stick it into your computer and\nyou format it, and it's 480 gigs, right?\n\n199\n00:10:09.504 --> 00:10:12.420\nAnd that's because of the different\nway they represent these numbers.\n\n200\n00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:15.290\nThe hard drive manufactures\nwill represent it one way.\n\n201\n00:10:15.290 --> 00:10:18.460\nAnd then your operating system will see\nit in another, so it kinda stinks but\n\n202\n00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:19.630\nit's how it is.\n\n203\n00:10:19.630 --> 00:10:20.993\nSo I can see that it detected it.\n\n204\n00:10:20.993 --> 00:10:25.030\nI can see that this particular\ndisk is a part of a volume group,\n\n205\n00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:29.950\nand it's got a partition that's\nsitting on it, so SDA1 is on it.\n\n206\n00:10:29.950 --> 00:10:32.990\nSo you can see some more\ninformation about that disk.\n\n207\n00:10:32.990 --> 00:10:36.472\nAnd if I wanna look for\nthe other one like, SDB, I can look and\n\n208\n00:10:36.472 --> 00:10:38.127\nI can see information on it.\n\n209\n00:10:38.127 --> 00:10:40.570\nLet me clear my screen and do that again.\n\n210\n00:10:40.570 --> 00:10:41.210\nThere.\n\n211\n00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:42.729\nSo I can see SDB and found it.\n\n212\n00:10:42.729 --> 00:10:46.200\nIt's a 36 gig disk and\nthere's no partition sitting on it.\n\n213\n00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:48.850\nSo I see that it did find it,\nand there it is.\n\n214\n00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:53.080\nThese are virtual hard\ndrives created by the MWare.\n\n215\n00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:55.960\nIf they weren't, I would actually see\nif it was Western Digital or whatever.\n\n216\n00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:57.100\nIt would display that kind of stuff.\n\n217\n00:10:58.330 --> 00:11:02.570\nNow, if you wanna find all of your hard\ndisks, that's a little bit harder.\n\n218\n00:11:02.570 --> 00:11:05.800\nBecause if we do a search for\nlike just SD,\n\n219\n00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:11.170\nyou’re gonna get a lot of extra results\nin there that are non-hard drive related.\n\n220\n00:11:11.170 --> 00:11:17.930\nSo, that can be problematic, if you do a\nsearch for the square bracket and then SD.\n\n221\n00:11:17.930 --> 00:11:22.180\nWell, grep is actually doing\na special kind of lookup.\n\n222\n00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:24.510\nIt's called using a regular expression and\n\n223\n00:11:24.510 --> 00:11:26.730\nthat square bracket is\na special symbol to it.\n\n224\n00:11:26.730 --> 00:11:28.370\nSo if we wanna do a search like that,\n\n225\n00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:30.850\nwe have to do what's called\nescaping the character.\n\n226\n00:11:30.850 --> 00:11:35.470\nYou have to throw a back slash before it\nto say, this next bracket is not a special\n\n227\n00:11:35.470 --> 00:11:39.030\nbracket, it's just a regular old bracket\nand I want you to search for it.\n\n228\n00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:41.680\nSo I'm just gonna do that,\nI'll kinda stick that before it.\n\n229\n00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:46.530\nAnd then now, I'm gonna get output for,\nand you'll see like SDC, SDD,\n\n230\n00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:47.890\nit's all kinda mixed together.\n\n231\n00:11:47.890 --> 00:11:50.920\nThere's SDB, wait, I saw SDB somewhere.\n\n232\n00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:54.030\nThere, SDB, so you'll start to see\nan information kinda mixed together.\n\n233\n00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:56.660\nAll right.\n\n234\n00:11:56.660 --> 00:11:59.920\nOr, if we're just looking for\nthe sizes and we wanna kinda spot that,\n\n235\n00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:06.420\nwe can do dmesg, type in the grep and\nlook for logical blocks.\n\n236\n00:12:07.570 --> 00:12:12.900\nAnd then right there, I see my four\ndrives, and I can see that SDA,\n\n237\n00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:16.019\nSDB, SDC, SDD and I can see their\nsizes over there on the right.\n\n238\n00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:19.710\nSo that's kinda how we can see\nthat they've been detected.\n\n239\n00:12:19.710 --> 00:12:22.930\nIf they haven't been detected,\nthen your system my not have support for\n\n240\n00:12:22.930 --> 00:12:23.870\nthose drives.\n\n241\n00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:27.820\nYou may need to load drivers or other\nsoftware to be able to recognize the disk.\n\n242\n00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:31.360\nNow, I am talking about\nthe physical disks here.\n\n243\n00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:34.310\nWe don't actually see\nthese on our system yet.\n\n244\n00:12:34.310 --> 00:12:37.000\nWell, we see SDA cuz\nit's got some partitions.\n\n245\n00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:41.460\nBut SDB, SDC, SDD,\nwe're not gonna see those in our computer\n\n246\n00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:44.042\nuntil we have some partitions on them and\nuntil we've mounted them.\n\n247\n00:12:44.042 --> 00:12:49.237\nSo like,\nif I run DF to lookup my free disk space.\n\n248\n00:12:49.237 --> 00:12:53.003\nWhen I look, I see SDA right there, right?\n\n249\n00:12:53.003 --> 00:12:55.534\nSDA1 at least, but I don't see SDB, SDC,\n\n250\n00:12:55.534 --> 00:12:58.557\nSDD cuz I just don't have\nthe partitions there yet.\n\n251\n00:12:58.557 --> 00:13:00.350\nSo we're gonna take a look\nat how to fix that.\n\n252\n00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:06.015\nWell, when you buy a new hard drive,\nthe hard drive probably came to you blank.\n\n253\n00:13:06.015 --> 00:13:07.650\nIt's probably got nothing on it.\n\n254\n00:13:07.650 --> 00:13:11.390\nYou can find out whether it's got any\npartitions or not using a very, very old\n\n255\n00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:17.110\ncommand called fdisk, fdisk is a super\ncool command that has been around forever.\n\n256\n00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:20.860\nBack in the old days,\nwe use it for formatting disks.\n\n257\n00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:22.190\nIt doesn't format anymore, but\n\n258\n00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:26.870\nit does let us set up our partition table\non a disk to get it ready to use, right?\n\n259\n00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:30.045\nAnd fdisk has a number of\nlittle command line switches,\n\n260\n00:13:30.045 --> 00:13:35.270\n-l is one of my favorite cuz it lets you\nlist, or look at the partitions on a disk.\n\n261\n00:13:35.270 --> 00:13:41.544\nSo, I can say fdisk -l /dev/sda.\n\n262\n00:13:41.544 --> 00:13:45.570\nTake a look at disk A, and\ntell me what partitions are on it.\n\n263\n00:13:45.570 --> 00:13:49.670\nAnd when you run that, I can see I've\ngot two partitions: SDA1 and SDA2.\n\n264\n00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:53.798\nAnd I can see that SDA1 is\nactually pretty small and\n\n265\n00:13:53.798 --> 00:13:57.360\nthat's gonna be our boot partition.\n\n266\n00:13:57.360 --> 00:14:00.920\nAnd then we've got SDA2,\nthat one's a lot bigger, all right.\n\n267\n00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:03.610\nSo I can see that and that's where I've\ngot a logical volume which we're gonna\n\n268\n00:14:03.610 --> 00:14:05.210\ntalk about a little bit later.\n\n269\n00:14:05.210 --> 00:14:11.950\nBut if I did the same thing for disk two,\nif I do SDB, when I look at that one.\n\n270\n00:14:11.950 --> 00:14:13.300\nI've got no partitions.\n\n271\n00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:17.190\nIt tells me about the disk, how many\ngigabytes it is, how many clusters and\n\n272\n00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:19.830\nblocks, and heads, and cylinders,\nand stuff like that, that it has.\n\n273\n00:14:19.830 --> 00:14:21.710\nBut, at the end of the day,\nit's got no partitions.\n\n274\n00:14:22.890 --> 00:14:26.550\nNow, before the show, I went ahead and\npartitioned disk C and\n\n275\n00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:29.490\ndisk D just by throwing one\nbig fat partition on them.\n\n276\n00:14:30.750 --> 00:14:32.660\nBut disk B is blank.\n\n277\n00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:33.440\nSo, on disk B,\n\n278\n00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:37.610\nI need to add at least one partition to it\nif I plan on working with it, all right.\n\n279\n00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:42.150\nNow, you may wanna create one or\nmore partitions on a disk.\n\n280\n00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:42.750\nStorage is so\n\n281\n00:14:42.750 --> 00:14:47.490\ncheap these days, most people just create\none big fat partition and that's it.\n\n282\n00:14:47.490 --> 00:14:48.010\nOkay.\n\n283\n00:14:48.010 --> 00:14:50.320\nSo creating a partition is\npretty straight forward.\n\n284\n00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:53.750\nYou say fdisk and\nthen the disk you wanna work with.\n\n285\n00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:55.270\nSo I wanna work with SDB.\n\n286\n00:14:55.270 --> 00:15:00.398\nSo I type in fdisk /dev/sdb.\n\n287\n00:15:00.398 --> 00:15:02.110\nAll right?\n\n288\n00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:03.580\nNow, I'm in the fdisk utility.\n\n289\n00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:06.900\nAnd it doesn't give us a whole heck\nof a lot on the screen to help us.\n\n290\n00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:10.002\nIt basically says that if you want,\nyou're in it,\n\n291\n00:15:10.002 --> 00:15:12.608\nyou can do some stuff, good luck, right?\n\n292\n00:15:12.608 --> 00:15:13.330\nIt doesn't really tell us.\n\n293\n00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:14.940\nIt tells us two commands.\n\n294\n00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:19.800\nYou can switch of, what it is,\nthe old DOS compatible mode, and\n\n295\n00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:23.390\nyou can change the units to\nsectors with a U, and that's it.\n\n296\n00:15:23.390 --> 00:15:27.180\nBut if you press M for help,\nbecause that's intuitive.\n\n297\n00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:32.140\nIf you press M for help, then you\nget the real commands that we need.\n\n298\n00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:34.940\nOkay, and we can see a few other\ncommands that are available for us.\n\n299\n00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:39.881\nThe ones that are really important C for\ncreate, I'm sorry not C for create,\n\n300\n00:15:39.881 --> 00:15:41.184\nit's N for create.\n\n301\n00:15:41.184 --> 00:15:42.319\nN is new, right?\n\n302\n00:15:42.319 --> 00:15:44.793\nSo if I wanna create a new partition,\nit's N.\n\n303\n00:15:44.793 --> 00:15:48.837\nWe've got P for print, so\nI can see what on the disk right now.\n\n304\n00:15:48.837 --> 00:15:51.876\nWe've got W for write Changes.\n\n305\n00:15:51.876 --> 00:15:56.015\nAs you make these changes they're not\nactually taking effect until you issue a w\n\n306\n00:15:56.015 --> 00:15:57.750\nto save them to the disk.\n\n307\n00:15:57.750 --> 00:15:58.630\nAlright.\n\n308\n00:15:58.630 --> 00:16:02.610\nSo most people are going to come in\nhere and hit n to add a new partition.\n\n309\n00:16:02.610 --> 00:16:06.270\nCreate the partition, use w to write and\nthen get out, and that's it.\n\n310\n00:16:06.270 --> 00:16:09.460\nAnd usually when you use the w to write,\nit actually exits for you.\n\n311\n00:16:09.460 --> 00:16:13.400\nSee how it says write table to disk and\nexit.\n\n312\n00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:18.410\nSo if I hit p for print, I get the same\nthing for F disk-L for a drive.\n\n313\n00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:23.560\nI can see there's no partitions on this\ndisk and I want to make a new one.\n\n314\n00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:28.810\nNow, when we make a partition in other\noperating systems, like in Windows or OSX.\n\n315\n00:16:28.810 --> 00:16:32.670\nThey usually just ask us how big we\nwant the disk to be in terms of size in\n\n316\n00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:33.940\ngigabytes, right?\n\n317\n00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:37.680\nOr megabytes, terabytes,\nhowever big your drive is right?\n\n318\n00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:42.190\nIn Linux it's much more specific.\n\n319\n00:16:42.190 --> 00:16:45.360\nMuch more technical cause\nit does it by blocks.\n\n320\n00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:48.320\nHow many blocks do you want\nto assign to the disk?\n\n321\n00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:51.610\nAnd, that can be kind of challenging\nsometimes because most of us don't think\n\n322\n00:16:51.610 --> 00:16:53.530\nin terms of blocks.\n\n323\n00:16:53.530 --> 00:16:56.250\nAnd so that's why when they list it up\nthere they talk about like how to kinda do\n\n324\n00:16:56.250 --> 00:16:57.140\nthe conversion.\n\n325\n00:16:57.140 --> 00:16:59.890\nIf you look at some of the notes\nthat are up there as far as\n\n326\n00:16:59.890 --> 00:17:02.800\ncylinders times 512 equals\nhowever many bytes.\n\n327\n00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:06.270\nThat's kind of giving that\nidea of how big our disk is.\n\n328\n00:17:06.270 --> 00:17:09.790\nBut if you're just partitioning it all\nthe way out it's actually pretty easy.\n\n329\n00:17:09.790 --> 00:17:12.315\nWe can hit N for new, and\n\n330\n00:17:12.315 --> 00:17:15.765\nit's gonna ask us what type of\npartition we want to create.\n\n331\n00:17:15.765 --> 00:17:18.835\nNow this is following the old\npartition table layout.\n\n332\n00:17:18.835 --> 00:17:23.865\nYou'll find where some operating systems\nhave started doing GPT disks, but\n\n333\n00:17:23.865 --> 00:17:26.440\nthat's not what we normally do.\n\n334\n00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:30.500\nI don't even do GPT discs in\nthe systems it support it because we\n\n335\n00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:33.155\ntypically don't do a ton\nof partitions on one disc.\n\n336\n00:17:33.155 --> 00:17:38.400\nIn the old partitioning scheme, you can\nonly have four partitions on a disc.\n\n337\n00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:42.330\nWell it is a rare day that you need\nmore that four partitions on a disc so\n\n338\n00:17:42.330 --> 00:17:44.300\nthat's more than fine for most people.\n\n339\n00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:48.060\nWith the newer GTP schemes,\nyou can do tons of partitions on a disk.\n\n340\n00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:49.600\nBut before what we need.\n\n341\n00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:51.610\nOn the old scheme if you\nwanted to do more than four,\n\n342\n00:17:51.610 --> 00:17:57.140\nyou could do three primary partitions and\nthen one extended partition.\n\n343\n00:17:57.140 --> 00:18:00.070\nAnd inside of that extended partition,\nyou could create multiple logical ones and\n\n344\n00:18:00.070 --> 00:18:01.620\nthen you could have as many\nas you wanted there too.\n\n345\n00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:02.990\nSo there's ways around it.\n\n346\n00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:08.000\nSo this, I call it the older partition\nlayout, but it's perfectly fine, and\n\n347\n00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.940\nit'll last for probably another 50 years\nbefore they come up with something new.\n\n348\n00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:14.160\nBut most of us are just gonna\nadd a primary partition and\n\n349\n00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:14.820\nthat's what I'm gonna do.\n\n350\n00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:16.010\nSo, I'm gonna hit P for primary.\n\n351\n00:18:17.330 --> 00:18:19.640\nAnd what do I want\nthe partition number to be?\n\n352\n00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:22.850\nNow, I don't have any partitions so\nI'll start with partition number one.\n\n353\n00:18:22.850 --> 00:18:26.740\nAnd just like Nate pointed out, we start\nwith one, we don't start with zero, and\n\n354\n00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:29.050\nthat's because zero's\nalready taken up by the MBR.\n\n355\n00:18:31.250 --> 00:18:34.240\nAll right,\nnow it starts asking craziness, right?\n\n356\n00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:36.430\nInstead of asking me how\nbig I want the disk to be,\n\n357\n00:18:36.430 --> 00:18:40.770\nit asks me what is the first cylinder\nI want to use for this partition?\n\n358\n00:18:40.770 --> 00:18:43.680\nI now need to understand how many\ncylinders are in the disc and\n\n359\n00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:45.700\nwhere I want to start and so on.\n\n360\n00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:47.000\nWell, it's not so bad.\n\n361\n00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.670\nBasically it looks at the disc and\n\n362\n00:18:48.670 --> 00:18:51.760\nit says all right,\nwhat's the first available cylinder.\n\n363\n00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:54.750\nSo if I already had a partition,\nit would give me the first cylinder\n\n364\n00:18:54.750 --> 00:18:58.510\nafter the existing partition\nwhich is what you typically want.\n\n365\n00:18:58.510 --> 00:19:01.960\nSince this is the very first partition,\none is what I want.\n\n366\n00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:04.400\nI wanna start with\nthe very first cylinder.\n\n367\n00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:06.130\nNow here's where it used to be annoying.\n\n368\n00:19:06.130 --> 00:19:09.200\nIt used to be annoying cuz the next it\nwould ask is, what's the last cylinder?\n\n369\n00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:10.740\nHow big do you want this to be?\n\n370\n00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:14.180\nWell, if I don't know what cylinders are,\nit's really hard to figure that out.\n\n371\n00:19:14.180 --> 00:19:18.230\nAnd so you might type 4,699,\nwhich will be my last cylinder.\n\n372\n00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:23.978\nOr if I wanted 50% of it, I might divide\nthat in half and do 2,345, right?\n\n373\n00:19:23.978 --> 00:19:26.760\nOr 50, or whatever I decide\nis the middle on that one.\n\n374\n00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:29.260\nAnd then that would be\nabout 50% of the drive.\n\n375\n00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:33.930\nBut in versions of Linux that\nhave been compiled since probably\n\n376\n00:19:33.930 --> 00:19:37.760\nabout seven years ago now,\nyou can actually specify the size.\n\n377\n00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:42.700\nYou can say a number followed by k,\nm, or g, so kilobytes, megabytes,\n\n378\n00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:44.890\nor gigabytes to specify that size.\n\n379\n00:19:44.890 --> 00:19:50.640\nSo if I want this to be, let's see,\nif I wanted to do a full disk,\n\n380\n00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:54.090\nI would just take 4699, but\nlet's say I want to do 35 gigabytes.\n\n381\n00:19:54.090 --> 00:19:55.990\nSo I'll just type in 35 g.\n\n382\n00:19:55.990 --> 00:19:56.950\nMy head is covering that.\n\n383\n00:19:56.950 --> 00:19:58.950\nHere I'll just move it up on my screen.\n\n384\n00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:01.180\nThere you go.\n\n385\n00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:04.000\nSo you can see right there where\nI just typed in 35 g, okay?\n\n386\n00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:07.770\nAnd that meant you figure it out for me.\n\n387\n00:20:07.770 --> 00:20:09.010\nI want 35 gigs.\n\n388\n00:20:09.010 --> 00:20:11.970\nYou figure out the cylinders because I\ndon't know what the heck they are, right?\n\n389\n00:20:11.970 --> 00:20:14.950\nSo that's a heck of a lot more\nconvenient than knowing the cylinders.\n\n390\n00:20:14.950 --> 00:20:19.060\nBut if I want to use the whole disk,\nthe whole thing, size can be tough.\n\n391\n00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:21.350\nCalculating out exactly\nwhat is the right size.\n\n392\n00:20:21.350 --> 00:20:25.910\nSo typing in 4699, that would make sure I\nuse all the way to the last cylinder and\n\n393\n00:20:25.910 --> 00:20:27.690\nI get the whole thing.\n\n394\n00:20:27.690 --> 00:20:29.460\nBut I'll just do 35 for now.\n\n395\n00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:34.000\nAnd if I hit p to print,\nI can see there it is right there.\n\n396\n00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.380\nI've got it in place.\n\n397\n00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:38.928\nIt is 281,106 blocks.\n\n398\n00:20:38.928 --> 00:20:40.566\nIt's terribly meaningful to us.\n\n399\n00:20:40.566 --> 00:20:41.506\nAnd there it is.\n\n400\n00:20:41.506 --> 00:20:43.680\nNow I have an sdb1.\n\n401\n00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:46.099\nWell, I will after I write these changes.\n\n402\n00:20:47.810 --> 00:20:50.640\nNow in the Linux world the default\npartitian is going to be set to have\n\n403\n00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:53.920\na system type of Linux, so\nI see that right there.\n\n404\n00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:58.590\nBut there's over 80 different partition\ntypes that are supported by f disc.\n\n405\n00:20:58.590 --> 00:21:01.880\nYou'll see things like a swap partition\nwhich you should really only have one of,\n\n406\n00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:03.620\nand it's created during the install.\n\n407\n00:21:03.620 --> 00:21:07.120\nBut there's also other ones like\npartitions that are being used for\n\n408\n00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:10.180\nWindows, dos primaries those\nkind of things like that.\n\n409\n00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:14.030\nAnd so there are other types that are out\nthere and if you look in your help,\n\n410\n00:21:14.030 --> 00:21:19.620\nyou will see in here where you can change\na partitions system id with a t command.\n\n411\n00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:21.710\nAnd we can use that to go in and\n\n412\n00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:25.280\nmanipulate somebody to\nbe a different type.\n\n413\n00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:28.760\nSo here is the list and\nyou'll see it's a big list.\n\n414\n00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:30.540\nSome of these are ancient, right?\n\n415\n00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:31.120\nFAT12.\nFAT12,\n\n416\n00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:37.660\nthat's what we used to format the 12-inch\nfloppies with in your really old systems.\n\n417\n00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:41.090\nFAT16, that's what we used\nto use in the DOS days.\n\n418\n00:21:41.090 --> 00:21:43.520\nYou'll see FAT32s tucked\naway in there somewhere.\n\n419\n00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:45.670\nYou've also got modern ones.\n\n420\n00:21:45.670 --> 00:21:46.600\nOpen BSD.\n\n421\n00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:47.330\nFree BSD.\n\n422\n00:21:47.330 --> 00:21:49.640\nThose are still used by those OSs.\n\n423\n00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:52.450\nSome of the other ones, you've got\nlike some of the older DOS ones.\n\n424\n00:21:52.450 --> 00:21:53.480\nThey're just all through here.\n\n425\n00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:54.820\nNovell Netware.\n\n426\n00:21:54.820 --> 00:21:59.625\nMinix, all these different partitions that\nwere used by alternate operating systems.\n\n427\n00:21:59.625 --> 00:22:04.210\nLinux and Linux swap are 82 and 83,\nand that's normally all we use.\n\n428\n00:22:04.210 --> 00:22:08.350\nBut if we're dual booting with\nother systems, if this a Mac or\n\n429\n00:22:08.350 --> 00:22:13.410\nan NT machine, Number 7, HPFS and NTFS.\n\n430\n00:22:13.410 --> 00:22:16.180\nNTFS still used today by Windows 8 and\nWindows Server 2012.\n\n431\n00:22:16.180 --> 00:22:21.770\nSo we need to pick based on whatever\nit is that we're choosing to support.\n\n432\n00:22:21.770 --> 00:22:25.120\n>> So what if we already have\nsome data onto this drive,\n\n433\n00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:28.330\nand we change our system id\nto one of these other ones.\n\n434\n00:22:28.330 --> 00:22:31.790\nIs it, do we have pull that format or\nchange our file system or anything?\n\n435\n00:22:31.790 --> 00:22:33.600\n>> Yeah, it breaks it,\nit breaks the partition.\n\n436\n00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:37.700\nYeah, if you had formated the partition\nout and put data on it already and\n\n437\n00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:40.760\nyou try and change it's type,\nit's gonna become inaccessible.\n\n438\n00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:42.490\nYeah it will be.\n\n439\n00:22:42.490 --> 00:22:44.800\nThe data may not be lost,\nyou might be able to put it back and\n\n440\n00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:46.070\nstill access the data.\n\n441\n00:22:46.070 --> 00:22:49.160\nBut while the type is wrong, you wont be\nable to get in there, unless you reformat\n\n442\n00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:51.240\n>> All right, okay.\n\n443\n00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:53.100\n>> Yep.\nSo Im gonna leave it be though.\n\n444\n00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:54.980\nI dont wanna mess with that.\n\n445\n00:22:54.980 --> 00:22:57.115\nAnd, is it gonna make me do it?\n\n446\n00:22:57.115 --> 00:22:59.110\n[LAUGH] Well, that stinks.\n\n447\n00:22:59.110 --> 00:23:02.200\nAll right, well,\nI'll just put it right back to 83.\n\n448\n00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:06.500\n83 is what it is already and let me\njust make sure I didnt screw up too bad.\n\n449\n00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:08.012\nThere we go.\n[LAUGH] So all right,\n\n450\n00:23:08.012 --> 00:23:09.860\nwe'll leave it that way.\n\n451\n00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:14.790\nNow I'm just gonna hit w to write that to\nthe disc, and now the change is in place.\n\n452\n00:23:14.790 --> 00:23:18.220\nIt wrote it, and\nit dropped me to a command prompt.\n\n453\n00:23:18.220 --> 00:23:20.810\nNow, when you create a partition,\n\n454\n00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:25.830\nyou don't necessarily see it\nright away in the system.\n\n455\n00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:28.290\nThe system won't recognize it\nautomatically in most cases.\n\n456\n00:23:28.290 --> 00:23:29.660\nSometimes it does, right?\n\n457\n00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:34.950\nNotice on mine, see what it says\ncalling ioctl re-read partition table.\n\n458\n00:23:34.950 --> 00:23:40.251\nIt reloaded the partition table and\nit found sdb right?\n\n459\n00:23:40.251 --> 00:23:43.085\nBut did it find sdb one?\n\n460\n00:23:43.085 --> 00:23:44.376\nI don't know, right?\n\n461\n00:23:44.376 --> 00:23:46.044\nSo, I could.\n\n462\n00:23:46.044 --> 00:23:49.251\nCheck my dmesg and\nsee if it shows up in there.\n\n463\n00:23:49.251 --> 00:23:50.290\nI don't think it will.\n\n464\n00:23:51.870 --> 00:23:57.020\nSo, I'm gonna just filter dmesg\nthrough grep to see if I can spot it.\n\n465\n00:23:57.020 --> 00:23:57.790\nAnd, it did.\n\n466\n00:23:57.790 --> 00:23:58.350\nIt turned up.\n\n467\n00:23:58.350 --> 00:24:01.190\nAll right.\nSo, sdb1 is picked up now, so I've got.\n\n468\n00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:02.060\nSo, I'm good to go.\n\n469\n00:24:02.060 --> 00:24:03.110\nI can work with it.\n\n470\n00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:03.800\nRight?\n\n471\n00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:06.600\nBut not every LINUX\ndistribution does that.\n\n472\n00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:08.810\nIf you exit F disk and\n\n473\n00:24:08.810 --> 00:24:13.050\nit doesn't give you a message about\nrereading the partition table,\n\n474\n00:24:13.050 --> 00:24:16.680\nthen that means that whatever your system\non is not going to dynamically detect it.\n\n475\n00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:21.230\nOn some you can force it\nby running partprobe, okay.\n\n476\n00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:24.280\nThat's the partition probe utility and\nit'll scan for\n\n477\n00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:26.569\nany new partitions that were created and\ntry and find them.\n\n478\n00:24:28.230 --> 00:24:32.220\nIf your disk already has some existing\npartitions on it that are in use,\n\n479\n00:24:32.220 --> 00:24:33.480\nit's not going to work.\n\n480\n00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:36.480\nNotice how mine it failed right here.\n\n481\n00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:39.010\nLet me move that up on my screen.\n\n482\n00:24:39.010 --> 00:24:43.280\nIt failed right here for sda,\nsda already has active partitions on it,\n\n483\n00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:44.300\nit couldn't do the probe.\n\n484\n00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:51.580\nBut sda, b and c, it was able to\nrescan that and find that partition.\n\n485\n00:24:51.580 --> 00:24:53.710\nSo just keep that in mind.\n\n486\n00:24:53.710 --> 00:24:55.670\nPartprobe might not work you.\n\n487\n00:24:55.670 --> 00:25:00.440\nIf it doesn't, so if F disk didn't\nreread the partition table, and\n\n488\n00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:04.230\nif Partprobe doesn't work for you, then\nthe only other way to get it to show up\n\n489\n00:25:04.230 --> 00:25:07.830\nIs to reboot, right, and this isn't\none of those unnecessary reboots.\n\n490\n00:25:07.830 --> 00:25:09.830\nIt literally is the only\nway to bring it back.\n\n491\n00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:13.504\nSo we can just reboot the system,\nand it'll pick up that partition and\n\n492\n00:25:13.504 --> 00:25:14.386\nbe in business.\n\n493\n00:25:14.386 --> 00:25:19.920\nSo, we can reboot our system,\njust reboot and off we go.\n\n494\n00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:22.380\nAnd at boot time while\nthe system is booting up,\n\n495\n00:25:22.380 --> 00:25:26.310\nit'll rescan the partitions and\npick them up while the disks are offline.\n\n496\n00:25:26.310 --> 00:25:29.915\nAnd then that way, it's able to find it\neven on disks with active partitions.\n\n497\n00:25:29.915 --> 00:25:32.190\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n498\n00:25:32.190 --> 00:25:33.440\nSo, Don.\nSo now, you know?\n\n499\n00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:35.385\nOnce we have our partitions created.\n\n500\n00:25:35.385 --> 00:25:35.920\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n501\n00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:38.710\n>> Do we still need to throw\na file system on these guys to\n\n502\n00:25:38.710 --> 00:25:40.870\nbe able to mount them up and use them?\n\n503\n00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:43.930\n>> Absolutely, yeah, I mean,\nthe partitions are there, but\n\n504\n00:25:43.930 --> 00:25:45.010\nwe can't see them.\n\n505\n00:25:45.010 --> 00:25:47.310\nThey still won't show up in like,\nthe DF utility,\n\n506\n00:25:47.310 --> 00:25:49.230\ncuz they're not mounted\nto a folder anywhere.\n\n507\n00:25:49.230 --> 00:25:52.210\nAnd they're definitely not formatted, so I\nwouldn't be able to copy anything to them.\n\n508\n00:25:52.210 --> 00:25:54.022\nSo we do still have some work to do.\n\n509\n00:25:57.785 --> 00:26:01.460\nSo if I run like df-h,\nI still don't see sdb1.\n\n510\n00:26:01.460 --> 00:26:04.060\nEven though I know it exists, I made it.\n\n511\n00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:06.770\nIt's not formatted and\nit's not mounted, all right?\n\n512\n00:26:06.770 --> 00:26:08.540\nAnd you can run the mount command.\n\n513\n00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:11.260\nThat's another command that'll show\nyou everything that's mounted.\n\n514\n00:26:11.260 --> 00:26:14.190\nAnd in here, you can see sda1 is mounted.\n\n515\n00:26:14.190 --> 00:26:18.359\nI don't see any SDB1 or SDC1,\nSDD1, any of those guys.\n\n516\n00:26:18.359 --> 00:26:20.588\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n517\n00:26:20.588 --> 00:26:21.749\n>> All right.\n\n518\n00:26:21.749 --> 00:26:25.655\nSo that's gonna be our next step,\nis getting the disk ready for use.\n\n519\n00:26:25.655 --> 00:26:30.910\nNow, in the old days,\nwhich would be as, as recently as\n\n520\n00:26:30.910 --> 00:26:34.885\nthree years ago [LAUGH] most of the time,\nwe would do just what Nate was saying.\n\n521\n00:26:34.885 --> 00:26:39.440\nWe'd mount that disk and we would format\nit first, and then we would mount it and\n\n522\n00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:41.590\noff we go, we're done.\n\n523\n00:26:41.590 --> 00:26:44.180\nMost modern Lenox distributions now use\n\n524\n00:26:44.180 --> 00:26:48.040\nsomething called the logical\nvolume manager, the LVM.\n\n525\n00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:49.910\nAnd instead of just\nformatting that disk and\n\n526\n00:26:49.910 --> 00:26:54.650\nmounting it directly, now we typically\ncreate a logical volume on top of it.\n\n527\n00:26:54.650 --> 00:26:57.570\nAnd the logical volume gives us some neat\n\n528\n00:26:57.570 --> 00:27:00.800\nfunctionality that we don't normally\nhave with the typical partition.\n\n529\n00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:03.680\nIf you format out a partition,\nand mount it directly and\n\n530\n00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:06.220\nthat's it, you can't expand it.\n\n531\n00:27:06.220 --> 00:27:07.170\nYou can't grow it.\n\n532\n00:27:07.170 --> 00:27:09.570\nYou can't stretch it\nacross more than one disk.\n\n533\n00:27:09.570 --> 00:27:11.670\nThere's a lot of stuff\nthat you just can't do.\n\n534\n00:27:11.670 --> 00:27:13.380\nBut with a logical volume,\n\n535\n00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:16.500\nyou can move it from physical\ndisk to physical disk as needed.\n\n536\n00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:18.930\nYou can stretch it across\nmore than one physical disk.\n\n537\n00:27:18.930 --> 00:27:21.340\nYou get a ton of extra bells and whistles.\n\n538\n00:27:21.340 --> 00:27:23.860\nAnd there's next to no performance hit.\n\n539\n00:27:23.860 --> 00:27:26.130\nIn fact, in most scenarios,\nlike the ones that I'm gonna show you,\n\n540\n00:27:26.130 --> 00:27:27.370\nthere's zero performance hit.\n\n541\n00:27:27.370 --> 00:27:30.140\nThere's only a few that actually\ncreate performance degradation.\n\n542\n00:27:30.140 --> 00:27:33.950\nSo for most people,\nthere is no reason not to do an LVM.\n\n543\n00:27:33.950 --> 00:27:37.720\nIf you use the logical volume manager,\nif you use the LVM,\n\n544\n00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:42.170\nthen you will have more flexibility and\nmore functionality going forward.\n\n545\n00:27:42.170 --> 00:27:45.570\nIf you don't use the LVM,\nyou're fine, you can run, but\n\n546\n00:27:45.570 --> 00:27:47.010\nyou lose out on those advanced features.\n\n547\n00:27:47.010 --> 00:27:49.710\nSo really,\neven if I only have one hard drive and\n\n548\n00:27:49.710 --> 00:27:52.290\nI'm doing one partition,\nI still do the LVM now.\n\n549\n00:27:52.290 --> 00:27:54.940\nSo I've just kinda made it\na part of my regular routine.\n\n550\n00:27:54.940 --> 00:27:57.760\n>> Yeah, Don, and correct me if I'm wrong,\nbut with the LVM,\n\n551\n00:27:57.760 --> 00:28:02.080\nyou can also work on these partitions\nwhile the system is online.\n\n552\n00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:07.350\nSo you did a traditional way you'd\nhave bring that disk offline.\n\n553\n00:28:07.350 --> 00:28:11.410\nBut with the LVM, you're soon to be up and\nrunning and you can still extend it, or\n\n554\n00:28:11.410 --> 00:28:13.620\nshrink it, or add more disks to it.\n\n555\n00:28:13.620 --> 00:28:16.490\n>> Yep, clone the disks,\nmove the disk off physicals.\n\n556\n00:28:16.490 --> 00:28:18.430\nYou can do all this stuff\nwhile it's live and online.\n\n557\n00:28:18.430 --> 00:28:19.620\nYeah, it's really powerful stuff.\n\n558\n00:28:19.620 --> 00:28:21.290\nIts really cool.\n\n559\n00:28:21.290 --> 00:28:22.840\nSo I want to take a look at that.\n\n560\n00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:24.940\nBut I also want to explain it first.\n\n561\n00:28:24.940 --> 00:28:26.590\nKind of what that process is with the LVM.\n\n562\n00:28:26.590 --> 00:28:29.170\nAnd looking at the clock,\nwe're a little short on time.\n\n563\n00:28:29.170 --> 00:28:30.330\nSo why don't we do this.\n\n564\n00:28:30.330 --> 00:28:31.900\nWhy don't we stop and take a break.\n\n565\n00:28:31.900 --> 00:28:36.595\nAnd when we get back, I'll splash some\nkind of color stuff on your shirt so\n\n566\n00:28:36.595 --> 00:28:41.319\nwe look different [LAUGH] and then we\nwill jump into the LVM, so stay tuned.\n\n567\n00:28:41.319 --> 00:28:42.771\nWe'll be back after this.\n\n568\n00:28:42.771 --> 00:28:46.388\n[SOUND] All right,\n\n569\n00:28:46.388 --> 00:28:51.699\nwelcome back everybody.\n\n570\n00:28:51.699 --> 00:28:56.940\nSo I wanted to take a minute to explain\nthe LVM, how it works, what it does.\n\n571\n00:28:56.940 --> 00:28:59.720\nAnd kinda get an idea of that general\npurpose before we go and implement it.\n\n572\n00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:03.589\nKinda nice to know what something does\nbefore we stumble through it, right?\n\n573\n00:29:03.589 --> 00:29:06.150\n[LAUGH] So\nlet me start with something really simple.\n\n574\n00:29:06.150 --> 00:29:11.270\nJust an example of how we can use the LVM\nin a single disk environment, all right?\n\n575\n00:29:11.270 --> 00:29:14.290\nSo I whipped up a quick drawing here.\n\n576\n00:29:14.290 --> 00:29:19.013\nAnd you'll see I've got a hard\ndrive here labeled /dev/sdb.\n\n577\n00:29:19.013 --> 00:29:22.010\nSo this is sdb,\nmy second hard drive, all right?\n\n578\n00:29:22.010 --> 00:29:24.340\nLet's say that I wanted to\ncreate a single Partition on it.\n\n579\n00:29:24.340 --> 00:29:26.837\nJust map the whole drive to\na single partition and go.\n\n580\n00:29:27.890 --> 00:29:32.220\nWell, I can do what we just did\na minute ago, which is go into fdisk,\n\n581\n00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:35.990\ncreate a partition in there and make sdb1.\n\n582\n00:29:35.990 --> 00:29:36.610\nOkay?\n\n583\n00:29:36.610 --> 00:29:38.080\nIn fact,\nI kind of need to do that either way.\n\n584\n00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:43.450\nI can go and do that, and\nthen I could, format sdb1,\n\n585\n00:29:43.450 --> 00:29:47.700\nformatted in one of the Linux file\nsystems, and then mount it and I'm done.\n\n586\n00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:49.460\nI'm using that disk and off I go.\n\n587\n00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:54.801\nBut one day, just as I'm working,\nI find that I run out of disk space.\n\n588\n00:29:54.801 --> 00:30:00.260\nWell, there's not much I can do,\nbecause it's just a single disc.\n\n589\n00:30:00.260 --> 00:30:02.910\nMy only option is to go out and\nbuy another hard drive and\n\n590\n00:30:02.910 --> 00:30:05.640\nmove my data over to it.\n\n591\n00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:09.400\nSo, if I don't want to do that, well tough\nluck, I'm full, I've gotta go in and\n\n592\n00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:10.750\ndelete files.\n\n593\n00:30:10.750 --> 00:30:15.820\nBut if I'd started with the LVM,\nI can easily add a second hard drive and\n\n594\n00:30:15.820 --> 00:30:19.730\nexpand to fill the data on that other\ndrive, it had that flexibility, all right?\n\n595\n00:30:19.730 --> 00:30:22.411\nIt's not necessarily the greatest\nlong-term solution, cuz,\n\n596\n00:30:22.411 --> 00:30:24.764\nif you lose the second drive,\nyou lose a lot of your data.\n\n597\n00:30:24.764 --> 00:30:27.540\nBut the way it works is really simple.\n\n598\n00:30:27.540 --> 00:30:31.270\nWhat we do is we take a disk and\n\n599\n00:30:31.270 --> 00:30:35.480\nwe use F disk and create a partition\non it like we just did, okay.\n\n600\n00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:40.180\nBut instead of mounting that partition and\nformatting it, we take it and\n\n601\n00:30:40.180 --> 00:30:43.810\nwe put it inside of what's\ncalled a volume group.\n\n602\n00:30:43.810 --> 00:30:49.936\nA volume group is like a little\nstorage space, like a locker.\n\n603\n00:30:49.936 --> 00:30:54.410\nAnd we put that drive in the volume group.\n\n604\n00:30:54.410 --> 00:30:55.920\nNow, we've only got one volume in there.\n\n605\n00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:56.570\nOne drive.\n\n606\n00:30:56.570 --> 00:30:57.980\nBut we put it in the volume group anyway.\n\n607\n00:30:59.090 --> 00:31:02.890\nAnd then, we create a logical volume.\n\n608\n00:31:02.890 --> 00:31:05.340\nA logical volume is basically a partition.\n\n609\n00:31:05.340 --> 00:31:08.780\nBut instead of being the traditional\nprimary partition sitting right on\n\n610\n00:31:08.780 --> 00:31:16.630\nthe disc, it's a logical volume sitting\ninside of the volume group, okay.\n\n611\n00:31:16.630 --> 00:31:18.584\nSo we can just take it, and\ndrop it right on top there.\n\n612\n00:31:18.584 --> 00:31:20.047\nLet's see if I can get this lined up.\n\n613\n00:31:20.047 --> 00:31:23.403\nAnd, I know, I'm wasting time\nhere being a perfectionist.\n\n614\n00:31:23.403 --> 00:31:26.293\n[LAUGH] So, we did [NOISE] it's perfect.\n\n615\n00:31:26.293 --> 00:31:28.540\nSo there's my logical volume.\n\n616\n00:31:28.540 --> 00:31:32.120\nAnd I wanted to get that lined up\nbecause we might have more than one\n\n617\n00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:33.200\nlogical volume.\n\n618\n00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:33.780\nRight?\n\n619\n00:31:33.780 --> 00:31:39.127\nAnd, so I might have my first LV and\nthen I create a second one and,\n\n620\n00:31:39.127 --> 00:31:43.126\nlet's see, let's send it backwards, there.\n\n621\n00:31:43.126 --> 00:31:47.834\nAnd so I start to create multiple logical\nvolumes, my God, it's like Legos.\n\n622\n00:31:47.834 --> 00:31:48.668\nThat's perfect.\n\n623\n00:31:48.668 --> 00:31:52.418\nSo there we go, so\nI start to create these Logical volumes.\n\n624\n00:31:52.418 --> 00:31:55.330\nAnd when I create them,\nthey're basically filling up that drive.\n\n625\n00:31:56.690 --> 00:32:00.550\nWell, if I run out of space and\nI've got more space,\n\n626\n00:32:00.550 --> 00:32:05.320\nI could take this logical volume and\nI could just go and extend it.\n\n627\n00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:08.190\nTo fill up more space on this drive, okay?\n\n628\n00:32:08.190 --> 00:32:12.330\nSo it fills up more space and of we go\nas I through more data in there it grows\n\n629\n00:32:12.330 --> 00:32:16.510\nagain and fills it up even more,\nall right.\n\n630\n00:32:16.510 --> 00:32:19.760\nNow once I fill the drive I run out again.\n\n631\n00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:20.410\nWhat do I do?\n\n632\n00:32:20.410 --> 00:32:23.170\nWell I would be out of luck if\nI was on a normal drive but\n\n633\n00:32:23.170 --> 00:32:26.360\nsince I had the foresight\nto create a volume group.\n\n634\n00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:28.910\nAll I have to do is throw\nanother hard drive in my system.\n\n635\n00:32:28.910 --> 00:32:30.350\nSo I can throw in SDC1.\n\n636\n00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:36.400\nAnd I take SDC, I use F disk and\nI create a partition.\n\n637\n00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:37.300\nSo now I've got SDC1.\n\n638\n00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:43.940\nAnd I take that partition and\nI add it to the volume group.\n\n639\n00:32:43.940 --> 00:32:48.240\nAnd now that it's in the volume group,\nI can go to my logical volume and\n\n640\n00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:49.420\nI can extend it.\n\n641\n00:32:49.420 --> 00:32:55.610\nAnd when I extend it,\nit can grow to span across both disks.\n\n642\n00:32:55.610 --> 00:32:59.963\nNow, my logical volume is actually\nthe size of both of those hard drives.\n\n643\n00:32:59.963 --> 00:33:06.610\nSo these were two 36 gig hard drives,\nnow I've got a 72 gig logical volume.\n\n644\n00:33:06.610 --> 00:33:07.410\nAnd when I mount it,\n\n645\n00:33:07.410 --> 00:33:10.640\nit shows as one folder in my\nsystem with 72 gigs available.\n\n646\n00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:13.540\nI don't have to think about\nwhat drives it's writing to.\n\n647\n00:33:13.540 --> 00:33:17.110\nAnd then if I continue to run out of\nspace, I can continue to add disks.\n\n648\n00:33:17.110 --> 00:33:21.520\nI can bring in another disk and\nI can bring it into the volume group, and\n\n649\n00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:27.000\nthen I can expand out my logical volume\nto fill it even more, all right?\n\n650\n00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:31.400\nNow, if I know I'm gonna be getting rid\nof a disk, or if I'm worried about a disk\n\n651\n00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:37.340\nfailing or whatever, I can shrink my\nlogical volume to make some room and then\n\n652\n00:33:37.340 --> 00:33:42.110\nI can have this system move the logical\nvolume like that, and it will do it.\n\n653\n00:33:42.110 --> 00:33:45.895\nIt will move it along and now I can\ndecommission this disk over here.\n\n654\n00:33:45.895 --> 00:33:48.900\nOr more commonly what we do is if\nwe are worried about disk failing\n\n655\n00:33:50.270 --> 00:33:53.340\nis if we were spanned across two disks.\n\n656\n00:33:53.340 --> 00:33:57.590\nThat's where we'd go out,\nwe'd buy the third hard drive,\n\n657\n00:33:57.590 --> 00:34:02.130\nwe'd add it to the volume group, and then\ninstead of stretching our existing disk,\n\n658\n00:34:02.130 --> 00:34:06.080\nwe have it move over like that by\nremoving this disk from the volume group.\n\n659\n00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:08.810\nSo it's really cool that\nit can do this stuff.\n\n660\n00:34:08.810 --> 00:34:10.700\nThe majority of which you can\ndo while the system's online.\n\n661\n00:34:10.700 --> 00:34:16.400\nIt's really fancy stuff, but it all starts\nwith properly setting up your disc.\n\n662\n00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:19.370\nIt really starts with a yes or\nno question during the install.\n\n663\n00:34:19.370 --> 00:34:23.660\nWhen we installed CentOS it, well,\nactually CentOS forced us to us the LVM.\n\n664\n00:34:23.660 --> 00:34:26.630\nWhen we installed Debian, it asked us,\n\n665\n00:34:26.630 --> 00:34:30.980\ndo you wanna use a traditional partition,\nof do you want to use the LVM.\n\n666\n00:34:30.980 --> 00:34:34.043\nAnd it we had just done\na regular partition, well,\n\n667\n00:34:34.043 --> 00:34:37.829\nthere's not really a good way to\nconvert over to using the LVM.\n\n668\n00:34:37.829 --> 00:34:41.250\nYou really need to back up your disk,\nrepartition, and restore your disk.\n\n669\n00:34:41.250 --> 00:34:44.920\nThere are some ways, I've seen on\nthe internet, but not ways that I trust.\n\n670\n00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:47.310\nSo there's different\nways to go about it but\n\n671\n00:34:47.310 --> 00:34:49.400\nit's best to have set up\nright from the beginning.\n\n672\n00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:53.500\nSo, for me,\neven if I only have one hard drive and\n\n673\n00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:58.360\nI'm planning on doing just one partition,\nI'm not planning on going crazy.\n\n674\n00:34:58.360 --> 00:35:01.480\nMight be a laptop,\nmight be my laptop right now.\n\n675\n00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:07.010\nThat, I go ahead create one volume group\nand then one logical volume on top of it,\n\n676\n00:35:07.010 --> 00:35:10.700\njust because I know that I'll be able to\nexpand it later if I need to, all right?\n\n677\n00:35:10.700 --> 00:35:13.024\nAnd then there's no performance hit,\nso you might as well do it.\n\n678\n00:35:13.024 --> 00:35:18.310\n>> Don, it reminds me a lot of\nthe storage spaces in Windows.\n\n679\n00:35:18.310 --> 00:35:19.180\n>> In Windows.\n\n680\n00:35:19.180 --> 00:35:22.460\n>> Yeah, where you can get a collection of\nhard drives and you can create a pool and\n\n681\n00:35:22.460 --> 00:35:25.330\noff that pool you can create\nyour different storage spaces.\n\n682\n00:35:25.330 --> 00:35:29.360\nNow within storage spaces you\ncan set up like a parity,\n\n683\n00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:33.430\nyou can have a little bit of redundancy\nto it in case of a disk fails\n\n684\n00:35:33.430 --> 00:35:37.820\nin this LVM can you set up some\nkind of redundancy in that as well.\n\n685\n00:35:37.820 --> 00:35:39.980\n>> Not as the feature the LVN itself, but\n\n686\n00:35:39.980 --> 00:35:43.250\nLinux has software RAID\nfunctions that you can use.\n\n687\n00:35:43.250 --> 00:35:44.440\nAnd so you combine the two.\n\n688\n00:35:44.440 --> 00:35:47.580\nYou use that with LVM and\nyou get that functionality.\n\n689\n00:35:47.580 --> 00:35:51.178\nSo, you would do F disk and then prior to\nbuilding the volume group you would enable\n\n690\n00:35:51.178 --> 00:35:53.120\nsoftware to RAID and go from there.\n\n691\n00:35:53.120 --> 00:35:55.550\nNow, they don't really cover\nsoftware RAID on the exam and\n\n692\n00:35:55.550 --> 00:35:58.100\nI don't like to cover it\neither because it sucks.\n\n693\n00:35:58.100 --> 00:36:02.890\nIt sucks in Windows and it sucks in Linux,\nit's just not good anywhere.\n\n694\n00:36:02.890 --> 00:36:06.999\nAnd so you want to use hardware\nRAID whenever possible.\n\n695\n00:36:06.999 --> 00:36:09.022\nSo if you're already doing hardware RAID,\n\n696\n00:36:09.022 --> 00:36:11.470\nthe LVM doesn't need to worry about it,\nright?\n\n697\n00:36:11.470 --> 00:36:12.250\nYou just come in here and\n\n698\n00:36:12.250 --> 00:36:14.250\nlay out your volume groups\nright on top of the RAID array.\n\n699\n00:36:14.250 --> 00:36:16.300\nAnd that's the best way to do it.\n\n700\n00:36:16.300 --> 00:36:19.270\nYou don't want to use software\nRAID on any production system.\n\n701\n00:36:19.270 --> 00:36:20.680\nIt's just not a good idea.\n\n702\n00:36:20.680 --> 00:36:24.750\n>> So I noticed that SDA\nis not included in here.\n\n703\n00:36:24.750 --> 00:36:29.820\nWould you ever add your root\nto this LVM as well, or not?\n\n704\n00:36:29.820 --> 00:36:30.730\n>> You can, yeah.\n\n705\n00:36:30.730 --> 00:36:34.850\nThe reason I left it out is because I'm\nabout to do this example on my machine.\n\n706\n00:36:34.850 --> 00:36:36.790\nAnd SDA was already done\nas part of the installer.\n\n707\n00:36:36.790 --> 00:36:39.840\nSo I've got three more disks,\nSPB, C and D.\n\n708\n00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:45.370\nBut when I did the install, SDA was added\nto a volume group and a logical volume.\n\n709\n00:36:45.370 --> 00:36:47.320\nIn fact, we can see that.\n\n710\n00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:51.450\nIf I go back here to my machine,\nwhen I take a look at df,\n\n711\n00:36:52.930 --> 00:36:59.590\nto get my drive utilization, I've got\n/dev/sda1 down there at the bottom.\n\n712\n00:36:59.590 --> 00:37:03.100\nAnd if you look at it,\nit's only 393 megs, right?\n\n713\n00:37:03.100 --> 00:37:05.430\nWell, SDA1, that's my boot.\n\n714\n00:37:05.430 --> 00:37:10.320\nBut if you look at up here,\nwhat's mounted to slash.\n\n715\n00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:17.753\nLook at that drive name,\n/dev/mapper/VolGroup-lv_root.\n\n716\n00:37:17.753 --> 00:37:21.610\nThe mapper,\nmapper is not an actual device.\n\n717\n00:37:21.610 --> 00:37:23.080\nIt's more of like an alias.\n\n718\n00:37:24.260 --> 00:37:26.430\nAnd when you do the LVM,\n\n719\n00:37:26.430 --> 00:37:32.250\nit will create aliases that are the volume\ngroup name dash the logical volume name.\n\n720\n00:37:32.250 --> 00:37:33.680\nSo that's why I'm seeing VolGroup,\n\n721\n00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:38.240\nthat's the name of the volume group\ncreated by the installer, and lv_root,\n\n722\n00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:41.000\nthat's the logical volume it made for\nmy root Install.\n\n723\n00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:42.260\nSo it actually did that.\n\n724\n00:37:42.260 --> 00:37:46.030\nI'm using the LVM as\nthe installer set it up.\n\n725\n00:37:46.030 --> 00:37:49.870\n>> So we can have multiple\nlogical volumes span across.\n\n726\n00:37:49.870 --> 00:37:53.150\nBut can we have more\nthan one volume group?\n\n727\n00:37:53.150 --> 00:37:54.360\n>> Absolutely, yep.\n\n728\n00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:57.690\nSo here they already made\na logical volume, I mean,\n\n729\n00:37:57.690 --> 00:38:00.390\na volume group called VolGroup,\nwhich I think is a dumb name.\n\n730\n00:38:00.390 --> 00:38:01.740\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So anyhow, so\n\n731\n00:38:01.740 --> 00:38:05.350\nI'm gonna create a new one, and so\nwe'll have more than one volume group.\n\n732\n00:38:05.350 --> 00:38:10.180\nAnd the reason is, you might have 12\ndiscs, and so you take four discs and\n\n733\n00:38:10.180 --> 00:38:11.370\nyou put them in one volume group,\n\n734\n00:38:11.370 --> 00:38:14.040\nyou take another four discs,\nput them in another volume group.\n\n735\n00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:16.080\nYou take two more discs,\nput them in a volume group.\n\n736\n00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:19.450\nAnd then you just leave two discs sitting\nthere to use as spares in the event you\n\n737\n00:38:19.450 --> 00:38:20.970\never have a failure, all right?\n\n738\n00:38:20.970 --> 00:38:23.510\nAnd then you start creating your\nlogical volumes inside of that.\n\n739\n00:38:23.510 --> 00:38:26.430\nYou could do one big fat\nvolume group if you wanted.\n\n740\n00:38:26.430 --> 00:38:28.100\nBut but you can create separate ones,\n\n741\n00:38:28.100 --> 00:38:29.690\nmaybe you're supporting\ndifferent customers.\n\n742\n00:38:29.690 --> 00:38:32.280\nSo you wanna isolate them to different\ndisks, you can do it that way.\n\n743\n00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:33.565\nSo all sorts of flexibility there.\n\n744\n00:38:33.565 --> 00:38:34.950\n>> Mm-hm, nice.\n\n745\n00:38:34.950 --> 00:38:38.940\n>> So, I'm not gonna mess with the ones it\nmade during the install just because out\n\n746\n00:38:38.940 --> 00:38:41.220\nof habit I don't like to mess with those.\n\n747\n00:38:41.220 --> 00:38:47.070\nBut in real life land, I'll tell you guys,\nit's very common for me to move slash var,\n\n748\n00:38:47.070 --> 00:38:52.720\nthat directory, to move it off to its\nown logical volume or even volume group.\n\n749\n00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:56.420\nA lot of times I'll move /home,\nthe user home directory, and it's so\n\n750\n00:38:56.420 --> 00:39:00.160\nI can control their size and expand them\nwithout affecting the rest of my system,\n\n751\n00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:04.438\nso, so I am somewhat use to doing that.\n\n752\n00:39:04.438 --> 00:39:05.759\n>> Mm-hm, nice.\n\n753\n00:39:05.759 --> 00:39:08.300\n>> All right, so\nlet's take a look at the process.\n\n754\n00:39:08.300 --> 00:39:11.470\nWe got a handful of commands for\nworking with the LVM, and\n\n755\n00:39:11.470 --> 00:39:15.310\nthey're really not bad as\nfar as what we expect.\n\n756\n00:39:15.310 --> 00:39:19.280\nTo get started with the LVM,\nwe need to do a few things.\n\n757\n00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:21.470\nFirst off we need partitions,\nso we already have that.\n\n758\n00:39:21.470 --> 00:39:25.024\nWe used f disc to partition out SDB And\n\n759\n00:39:25.024 --> 00:39:29.159\nI had already partitioned out SDC and SDD.\n\n760\n00:39:29.159 --> 00:39:30.730\nIt gets kind of tongue tied.\n\n761\n00:39:30.730 --> 00:39:33.600\nSo I've got three partitions\nthat are out there that\n\n762\n00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:36.630\nare basically 35 gig partitions,\nor at least I think they are.\n\n763\n00:39:36.630 --> 00:39:38.710\nLet me just double check that.\n\n764\n00:39:38.710 --> 00:39:43.666\nSo if I look at sdb, it's got one, 281106,\n\n765\n00:39:43.666 --> 00:39:47.252\nand these guys, why is that bigger?\n\n766\n00:39:47.252 --> 00:39:48.584\nWhat did I do?\n\n767\n00:39:48.584 --> 00:39:51.376\nDid I get my sizes mixed up?\n\n768\n00:39:57.144 --> 00:40:01.400\nApparently my SDC and SDD are much bigger.\n\n769\n00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:03.150\nLet me go fix that real quick.\n\n770\n00:40:03.150 --> 00:40:08.000\nSo I'm gonna go into dev/sdb.\n\n771\n00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:11.110\nAll right, and\nI'm gonna delete that partition.\n\n772\n00:40:11.110 --> 00:40:14.580\nSo partition 1, I'm gonna delete it,\nand I'm just gonna recreate it.\n\n773\n00:40:14.580 --> 00:40:18.530\nAnd this time,\nI'm making sure I do the entire disk so\n\n774\n00:40:18.530 --> 00:40:19.940\nthat I've got them all the same size.\n\n775\n00:40:19.940 --> 00:40:22.380\nThey don't actually have\nto be the same size.\n\n776\n00:40:22.380 --> 00:40:23.890\nI just want them to be the same size,\n\n777\n00:40:23.890 --> 00:40:26.420\nso the math is a little bit\neasier on me later on [LAUGH].\n\n778\n00:40:26.420 --> 00:40:29.250\nBut you can have disks of\ncompletely different size.\n\n779\n00:40:29.250 --> 00:40:33.980\nI can have a 1 terabyte drive and\na 2 terabyte drive and a 500 gig drive.\n\n780\n00:40:33.980 --> 00:40:37.980\nAnd I can combine them all together to get\nthree and a half terabytes or whatever.\n\n781\n00:40:37.980 --> 00:40:43.490\nSo you can mix and match like that,\ndefinitely something you can do.\n\n782\n00:40:44.610 --> 00:40:47.505\nAll right, let me just check and\nmake sure that is the same.\n\n783\n00:40:51.945 --> 00:40:55.922\nAnd I wonder why I'm getting\na wildly different block.\n\n784\n00:40:55.922 --> 00:40:57.370\nLook, my start.\n\n785\n00:40:57.370 --> 00:40:59.732\nI messed it up again, hang on, let me-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n786\n00:40:59.732 --> 00:41:02.824\n>> So this is why it's important to\n\n787\n00:41:02.824 --> 00:41:03.745\nverify.\n\n788\n00:41:03.745 --> 00:41:08.110\nWhen you make these changes, we can\nkind of assume they're right sometimes.\n\n789\n00:41:08.110 --> 00:41:08.990\nBut, see how I screwed it up.\n\n790\n00:41:08.990 --> 00:41:10.890\nThe start and end block are the same.\n\n791\n00:41:10.890 --> 00:41:12.855\nI just made this thing incredibly small,\napparently.\n\n792\n00:41:12.855 --> 00:41:15.390\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, I know what I did wrong.\n\n793\n00:41:15.390 --> 00:41:16.450\nI delete the partition,\n\n794\n00:41:16.450 --> 00:41:19.535\nand then I immediately created\none without saving the changes.\n\n795\n00:41:19.535 --> 00:41:23.180\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So you gotta delete it to free up room,\n\n796\n00:41:23.180 --> 00:41:26.860\nand then you can jump back in there and\ncreate the new one.\n\n797\n00:41:26.860 --> 00:41:28.500\nAnd that's what I did, yep.\n\n798\n00:41:28.500 --> 00:41:33.665\nSo now I can say I'm gonna start with\nthe first cylinder and end with 4,699.\n\n799\n00:41:33.665 --> 00:41:35.590\nAnd I'll write that.\n\n800\n00:41:35.590 --> 00:41:42.460\nAnd now, I should see the same\nnumbers across all these.\n\n801\n00:41:42.460 --> 00:41:44.335\nThere you go,\nnow they're all the same size, good.\n\n802\n00:41:44.335 --> 00:41:45.260\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n803\n00:41:45.260 --> 00:41:46.825\n>> All right, so I've got these drives.\n\n804\n00:41:46.825 --> 00:41:49.858\nAnd what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna\nstart with just two of them, and\n\n805\n00:41:49.858 --> 00:41:52.524\nthen I'll add the third one\nin after the fact, all right?\n\n806\n00:41:52.524 --> 00:41:58.770\nSo I wanna take SDB and SDC, I wanna take\nthose and put them in a volume group.\n\n807\n00:41:58.770 --> 00:42:02.960\nAnd then I wanna create a logical\nvolume that covers both of them, right?\n\n808\n00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:06.550\nAnd so,\nif I do 35 gigs on each one of them,\n\n809\n00:42:06.550 --> 00:42:10.610\nI should end up with a 70 gig drive,\nright?\n\n810\n00:42:10.610 --> 00:42:12.540\nEven though my drive's\nonly 35 gigs in size,\n\n811\n00:42:12.540 --> 00:42:14.230\nbecause I span across the two of them.\n\n812\n00:42:14.230 --> 00:42:15.670\nSo that's what I'm gonna try and\n\n813\n00:42:15.670 --> 00:42:19.680\ndo to get this kind of set up\nin an easy to understand way.\n\n814\n00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:24.665\nStep number one, if you did a minimal\nserver install, it probably set\n\n815\n00:42:24.665 --> 00:42:30.345\nup the LDM for you, but\nit probably didn't install the LDM tools.\n\n816\n00:42:30.345 --> 00:42:34.601\nSo you might need to install those tools,\nI should already have them, but\n\n817\n00:42:34.601 --> 00:42:37.774\njust in case you can do a yum\ninstall lvm2, all right?\n\n818\n00:42:37.774 --> 00:42:40.565\nThere's two versions of the lvm,\nthe old one and the new one,\n\n819\n00:42:40.565 --> 00:42:42.447\nlvm2 is typically what we want.\n\n820\n00:42:42.447 --> 00:42:43.067\nAnd if you run that,\n\n821\n00:42:43.067 --> 00:42:45.810\nthat's what gonna install the tools\nif you don't already have them.\n\n822\n00:42:45.810 --> 00:42:47.610\nSo I'm gonna run it on mine.\n\n823\n00:42:47.610 --> 00:42:51.340\nAnd we will see, and there we go,\nit already exists, nothing to do.\n\n824\n00:42:51.340 --> 00:42:54.070\nIf I had done a minimal install,\nit might be telling me right now, hey,\n\n825\n00:42:54.070 --> 00:42:56.300\nwe'll install the stuff.\n\n826\n00:42:56.300 --> 00:42:58.780\nAll right, you gotta have that.\n\n827\n00:42:58.780 --> 00:43:02.810\nThen, I need to do what's called\ncreating our physical volume.\n\n828\n00:43:02.810 --> 00:43:05.810\nSo we've got a few different\ncommands that we're gonna run here.\n\n829\n00:43:05.810 --> 00:43:09.840\nTechnically, we already have the physical\ndisks, and they already have partitions.\n\n830\n00:43:09.840 --> 00:43:13.120\nWe need to tell it that we're\ngonna use that in the LVM.\n\n831\n00:43:13.120 --> 00:43:18.540\nAnd so to do that,\nwe use our pvcreate command, all right?\n\n832\n00:43:18.540 --> 00:43:22.105\nSo we've got physical volumes and\nlogical volumes.\n\n833\n00:43:22.105 --> 00:43:24.889\nAnd the physical volumes\nare our disks themselves, so\n\n834\n00:43:24.889 --> 00:43:29.188\nwe're gonna use pvcreate to point to these\nnew disks to tell them that they're gonna\n\n835\n00:43:29.188 --> 00:43:30.835\nbe a part of the LVM, all right?\n\n836\n00:43:30.835 --> 00:43:37.575\nSo, I'll say pvcreate/dev/sdb1 and\n\n837\n00:43:37.575 --> 00:43:40.275\n/dev/sdc1.\n\n838\n00:43:40.275 --> 00:43:44.425\nI'm pointing to those two partitions\nthat I created earlier, and\n\n839\n00:43:44.425 --> 00:43:48.677\nI'm saying these guys are now gonna\nbe a part of the LVM, all right?\n\n840\n00:43:48.677 --> 00:43:53.011\nAnd so there we go, physical volumes\nsuccessfully created, all right?\n\n841\n00:43:53.011 --> 00:43:56.230\nSo now the LVM is aware of those disks.\n\n842\n00:43:56.230 --> 00:43:58.260\nNow I need to stick them\ninto a volume group.\n\n843\n00:43:58.260 --> 00:44:02.200\nSo I'm gonna combine them together and\nget them ready.\n\n844\n00:44:02.200 --> 00:44:04.770\nSo I used pvcreate for that.\n\n845\n00:44:04.770 --> 00:44:06.690\nNow I'm gonna use vgcreate, all right?\n\n846\n00:44:07.860 --> 00:44:10.710\nSo commands not so\nbad to remember on this one.\n\n847\n00:44:10.710 --> 00:44:12.780\nAnd vgcreate works about the same way.\n\n848\n00:44:12.780 --> 00:44:14.650\nI need to give the volume group a name.\n\n849\n00:44:14.650 --> 00:44:19.300\nAnd the very first time I used the LVM,\nI was shown this naming convention.\n\n850\n00:44:19.300 --> 00:44:21.310\nI've pretty much stuck\nwith it ever since then.\n\n851\n00:44:21.310 --> 00:44:25.787\nAnd so I usually just do vg1,\nvg2, vg3 for volume groups and\n\n852\n00:44:25.787 --> 00:44:28.755\nlv1, lv2, lv3 for logical volumes.\n\n853\n00:44:28.755 --> 00:44:30.530\nBut you can do names if you want.\n\n854\n00:44:30.530 --> 00:44:33.954\nIf this is going to be your accounting\nfile server, you can call this\n\n855\n00:44:33.954 --> 00:44:37.517\naccounting and give them names like that,\nbut I usually just do vg1.\n\n856\n00:44:37.517 --> 00:44:41.174\nAll right, and then we need to specify\nthe physical volumes that we just created,\n\n857\n00:44:41.174 --> 00:44:44.314\nwhich conveniently, have the same\nexact names that they had before.\n\n858\n00:44:44.314 --> 00:44:52.120\nSo, I'm just gonna say /dev/sdb1,\n/dev/sdc1, all right?\n\n859\n00:44:52.120 --> 00:44:55.760\nSo that's gonna take those two drives and\ncombine them into a volume group.\n\n860\n00:44:57.120 --> 00:45:02.740\nSo if I go back to my diagram, what I just\ndid, let me get that guy out of there,\n\n861\n00:45:02.740 --> 00:45:08.780\nis we took sdb1 and sdc1 and\nstuck them into vg1, okay?\n\n862\n00:45:10.540 --> 00:45:13.380\nSo, that's what I've made so far.\n\n863\n00:45:13.380 --> 00:45:13.880\nOkay.\n\n864\n00:45:14.920 --> 00:45:18.030\nThe next step is gonna be to create\nthe logical volume, but before I do that,\n\n865\n00:45:18.030 --> 00:45:20.410\nI wanna make sure I\ndon't make any mistakes.\n\n866\n00:45:20.410 --> 00:45:25.510\nSo, after I create these, I like to\nverify that they were created properly.\n\n867\n00:45:25.510 --> 00:45:29.420\nI used pvcreate to create\nthe physical disc and\n\n868\n00:45:29.420 --> 00:45:31.955\nvgcreate to create the volume group.\n\n869\n00:45:31.955 --> 00:45:34.900\nWell, you also have pvdisplay and\n\n870\n00:45:34.900 --> 00:45:38.065\nvgdisplay to see whether\nthey are actually there.\n\n871\n00:45:38.065 --> 00:45:42.920\nSo I'm gonna run pvdisplay and\nI'll pipe that into a more prompt,\n\n872\n00:45:42.920 --> 00:45:45.690\njust because it gives you a lot of data.\n\n873\n00:45:45.690 --> 00:45:50.150\nSo there I can see /dev/sdb1 is in vg1.\n\n874\n00:45:50.150 --> 00:45:51.890\nSo, I'm seeing that right there.\n\n875\n00:45:51.890 --> 00:45:53.954\nAnd sdc1 is in vg1.\n\n876\n00:45:53.954 --> 00:45:56.369\nSo, there's the two that I created, and\n\n877\n00:45:56.369 --> 00:46:00.654\nthey're in their appropriate volume\ngroup and they're 36 gigs each.\n\n878\n00:46:00.654 --> 00:46:04.454\nAnd if I continue on, I'll see\nthe ones that the installer created.\n\n879\n00:46:04.454 --> 00:46:08.236\nSo, I can see sda2 is in VolGroup,\n\n880\n00:46:08.236 --> 00:46:14.175\nthat was part of the installation\nwhen it created that.\n\n881\n00:46:14.175 --> 00:46:17.633\nAll right, so that was pvdisplay, right,\n\n882\n00:46:17.633 --> 00:46:23.485\nthere's also vgdisplay,\nwhich will show the volume groups.\n\n883\n00:46:23.485 --> 00:46:29.050\nAnd when I run vgdisplay, there's vg1\nthat I made, right, I can see it's there.\n\n884\n00:46:29.050 --> 00:46:31.660\nIt has two metadata areas.\n\n885\n00:46:31.660 --> 00:46:35.955\nIt is, right now, 71.98 gigabytes in size,\n\n886\n00:46:35.955 --> 00:46:38.275\ncuz it's combining those 2 disks for\nthe volume group.\n\n887\n00:46:38.275 --> 00:46:40.130\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n888\n00:46:40.130 --> 00:46:42.940\n>> And then the VolGroup beneath it there\nthat was created by the installer is 20\n\n889\n00:46:42.940 --> 00:46:44.635\ngigs in size, so I can see it too.\n\n890\n00:46:44.635 --> 00:46:46.560\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n891\n00:46:46.560 --> 00:46:49.330\n>> So, so far,\neverything's looking like I wanted it to.\n\n892\n00:46:49.330 --> 00:46:50.890\nSo we created the physical volume,\n\n893\n00:46:50.890 --> 00:46:55.120\nwe created the volume group,\nnow let's create the logical volume.\n\n894\n00:46:55.120 --> 00:46:57.660\nThe logical volume is what we're actually\ngonna work with at the end of the day, so\n\n895\n00:46:57.660 --> 00:46:59.300\nthis is probably the most important part.\n\n896\n00:47:00.490 --> 00:47:03.350\nSo to create a logical volume,\nwe just use,\n\n897\n00:47:03.350 --> 00:47:06.460\nyou've probably figured out the pattern\nat this point, lvcreate, okay?\n\n898\n00:47:06.460 --> 00:47:11.980\npv for physical volume, vg for volume\ngroup, and lv for the logical volume.\n\n899\n00:47:13.700 --> 00:47:17.514\nWe can specify -L and\nthen give it the size.\n\n900\n00:47:17.514 --> 00:47:19.994\nI'm gonna go 70 gigs.\n\n901\n00:47:19.994 --> 00:47:23.866\nI'm gonna create a 70 gig drive,\nso if I have 36 gig drives,\n\n902\n00:47:23.866 --> 00:47:26.675\nI shouldn't be able to\ndo more than 36 gigs.\n\n903\n00:47:26.675 --> 00:47:28.266\nBut I should be able to do 70,\n\n904\n00:47:28.266 --> 00:47:32.195\nbecause combined those 2 drives will\nprovide me with 70 gigs of storage.\n\n905\n00:47:32.195 --> 00:47:37.454\nSo I'll do 70 gigs,\nit's gonna be in vg1, all right?\n\n906\n00:47:37.454 --> 00:47:39.240\nAnd then I need to give it a name.\n\n907\n00:47:39.240 --> 00:47:40.320\nWhat do I want to call it?\n\n908\n00:47:40.320 --> 00:47:43.918\nAnd I'm just gonna call it lv1,\nall right, logical volume one.\n\n909\n00:47:43.918 --> 00:47:45.544\nRemember, you can call\nit whatever you want.\n\n910\n00:47:45.544 --> 00:47:49.626\nSo if your volume group might be\n>> Corporate data.\n\n911\n00:47:49.626 --> 00:47:51.296\nSo, corp data or whatever.\n\n912\n00:47:51.296 --> 00:47:53.780\nAnd then,\nthis logic volume might be accounting.\n\n913\n00:47:53.780 --> 00:47:56.030\nAnd then, another logical volume\nmight be sales, or whatever.\n\n914\n00:47:56.030 --> 00:47:59.320\nAnd so, you can name them based on\nthe type of data that are in there.\n\n915\n00:47:59.320 --> 00:48:00.280\nI just like these names.\n\n916\n00:48:00.280 --> 00:48:01.509\nYour end users never see these names.\n\n917\n00:48:01.509 --> 00:48:02.611\nSo, it doesn't really matter to them.\n\n918\n00:48:02.611 --> 00:48:05.438\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Cuz once we format them,\n\n919\n00:48:05.438 --> 00:48:07.580\nwe're gonna mount them to a folder.\n\n920\n00:48:07.580 --> 00:48:09.180\nAnd it's the folder name they see.\n\n921\n00:48:09.180 --> 00:48:10.540\nSo, you just pick a good folder name.\n\n922\n00:48:10.540 --> 00:48:12.178\nThe volume group itself\ndoesn't really matter.\n\n923\n00:48:12.178 --> 00:48:14.320\nAll right.\n\n924\n00:48:14.320 --> 00:48:17.860\nSo, when I run that,\nthat's gonna create the logical volume.\n\n925\n00:48:17.860 --> 00:48:22.705\nAnd I can verify that is there using\nthe good old LV display command.\n\n926\n00:48:22.705 --> 00:48:25.644\nSo, lv display will show\nme my logical volumes.\n\n927\n00:48:25.644 --> 00:48:30.200\nForgot to pump that into more.\n\n928\n00:48:30.200 --> 00:48:32.300\nSince we've got several logical volume.\n\n929\n00:48:32.300 --> 00:48:35.500\nI'll pipe that clear command in the more,\nthat's effective.\n\n930\n00:48:35.500 --> 00:48:36.530\nAll right, there we go.\n\n931\n00:48:36.530 --> 00:48:42.635\nSo, I can see that I do have logical\nvolume one inside of volume group one,\n\n932\n00:48:42.635 --> 00:48:47.180\nand that's running in\nit's 70 gigs in size.\n\n933\n00:48:47.180 --> 00:48:51.138\nAnd I've got lv_root inside of VolGroup.\n\n934\n00:48:51.138 --> 00:48:55.690\nAnd I've got lv_swap\ninside of VolGroup also.\n\n935\n00:48:55.690 --> 00:48:59.500\nTwo logical volumes there inside\nof that one volume group.\n\n936\n00:49:00.560 --> 00:49:01.300\nAll right.\n\n937\n00:49:01.300 --> 00:49:03.150\nSo, my logical volumes are created.\n\n938\n00:49:03.150 --> 00:49:04.010\nMy physical volume.\n\n939\n00:49:04.010 --> 00:49:05.320\nEverything's in place.\n\n940\n00:49:05.320 --> 00:49:12.943\nNow, if I go back to my diagram,\nwhat I have is This.\n\n941\n00:49:12.943 --> 00:49:17.766\nExcept it's called, well,\nwe called it LV1 this time around, right?\n\n942\n00:49:17.766 --> 00:49:20.320\nSo, that's what we're looking at now.\n\n943\n00:49:21.810 --> 00:49:23.088\nThere's our configuration.\n\n944\n00:49:23.088 --> 00:49:25.275\nAll right.\n\n945\n00:49:25.275 --> 00:49:28.590\nI'm being a perfectionist here,\nI'm gonna strike this out.\n\n946\n00:49:28.590 --> 00:49:33.110\nOkay, so, that's what we're looking at\nnow, and we're ready to rock, right?\n\n947\n00:49:33.110 --> 00:49:38.050\nWell, just like any partition,\nit's not really usable until we format it.\n\n948\n00:49:38.050 --> 00:49:40.560\nSo, we're gonna need to\nformat that logical volume.\n\n949\n00:49:40.560 --> 00:49:43.970\nAnd then, we'll be able to mount it to\nour system and actually use it, okay?\n\n950\n00:49:43.970 --> 00:49:45.205\nSo, that's gonna be our next step.\n\n951\n00:49:45.205 --> 00:49:48.230\nNow, this is probably a pretty good\nspot to stop and take a break.\n\n952\n00:49:48.230 --> 00:49:50.850\nSo, Nate,\ncan you think of anything else to add?\n\n953\n00:49:50.850 --> 00:49:52.540\n>> No, but I got someting after the break.\n\n954\n00:49:52.540 --> 00:49:53.840\n>> Okay, sweet.\n\n955\n00:49:53.840 --> 00:49:55.180\nAll right.\nWell, let's stop here and take a break.\n\n956\n00:49:55.180 --> 00:49:58.670\nWhen we get back, we're gonna format that\ndrive and we're gonna make it available.\n\n957\n00:49:58.670 --> 00:50:00.870\nSo, we'll get to see the actual utility.\n\n958\n00:50:00.870 --> 00:50:01.715\nSo, stay tuned.\n\n959\n00:50:01.715 --> 00:50:02.966\nWe'll be back after this.\n\n960\n00:50:02.966 --> 00:50:10.300\n[MUSIC]\n\n961\n00:50:10.300 --> 00:50:11.988\n>> All right, welcome back, everybody.\n\n962\n00:50:11.988 --> 00:50:13.869\nSo, now it's time for some fun.\n\n963\n00:50:13.869 --> 00:50:14.728\nAll right.\n\n964\n00:50:14.728 --> 00:50:18.465\nIf we have a partition sitting there and\nwe want to use it.\n\n965\n00:50:18.465 --> 00:50:20.615\nOr in our case, a logical volume.\n\n966\n00:50:20.615 --> 00:50:22.265\nWe've gotta format it and\n\n967\n00:50:22.265 --> 00:50:25.035\nmount it before we can have it\navailable on the system, right?\n\n968\n00:50:25.035 --> 00:50:28.670\nSo, if we had chosen not to do the LVM,\n\n969\n00:50:28.670 --> 00:50:31.160\nthen you'd skip all those\nLVM steps that we just did.\n\n970\n00:50:31.160 --> 00:50:34.210\nAll the pvcreate, vgcreate,\nall that good stuff, and\n\n971\n00:50:34.210 --> 00:50:36.140\nyou'd jump right to this step here.\n\n972\n00:50:36.140 --> 00:50:38.900\nBut if you did the logical volumes,\nyou go through everything we just did, and\n\n973\n00:50:38.900 --> 00:50:41.440\nnow it's time to make that disk available,\nall right?\n\n974\n00:50:41.440 --> 00:50:45.320\nThe first thing we need to do is we need\nto get in and format the disk, all right?\n\n975\n00:50:46.460 --> 00:50:48.280\nFormatting the disk is kinda weird.\n\n976\n00:50:48.280 --> 00:50:52.010\nYou have a command called mkfs, all right?\n\n977\n00:50:52.010 --> 00:50:54.620\nMkfs is make file system.\n\n978\n00:50:54.620 --> 00:50:58.890\nAnd it's a strange command because\nit doesn't actually do anything.\n\n979\n00:50:58.890 --> 00:51:01.620\nMkfs is just a generic wrapper\n\n980\n00:51:01.620 --> 00:51:06.500\nthat encapsulates a series of other\ncommands that actually do something.\n\n981\n00:51:06.500 --> 00:51:10.020\nAnd so, when we call it, we're telling\nit we wanna format a system and\n\n982\n00:51:10.020 --> 00:51:11.490\nget it to do something, all right?\n\n983\n00:51:11.490 --> 00:51:14.260\nSo, it says in here, in the output for\n\n984\n00:51:14.260 --> 00:51:18.790\nthe command, you can use dash T followed\nby the file system type that you want to\n\n985\n00:51:18.790 --> 00:51:22.480\nformat a drive with, but\nI very rarely use that.\n\n986\n00:51:22.480 --> 00:51:25.825\nAnd the reason is most of\nthe Linux distros today\n\n987\n00:51:25.825 --> 00:51:28.405\nutilize a very simple alias system.\n\n988\n00:51:28.405 --> 00:51:34.235\nIf we look at, let's see, I think it's,\nslash sbin, is where they're stored.\n\n989\n00:51:34.235 --> 00:51:38.300\nI'm gonna pull up a directory\nlisting of /sbin/mkfs.star,\n\n990\n00:51:38.300 --> 00:51:40.780\nanything that starts with mkfs.\n\n991\n00:51:40.780 --> 00:51:45.000\nAnd what you'll see is\na series of commands in here.\n\n992\n00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:46.520\nThese are the real commands.\n\n993\n00:51:46.520 --> 00:51:54.440\nSo, you've got mkfs.cramfs.ext2,\next3, 4, msdos, vfat, right?\n\n994\n00:51:54.440 --> 00:51:58.750\nThese are the files systems\nthat mkfs supports formatting.\n\n995\n00:51:58.750 --> 00:52:01.570\nAnd I see seven of them, all right?\n\n996\n00:52:01.570 --> 00:52:04.470\nOn your system, you might see 20 of them.\n\n997\n00:52:04.470 --> 00:52:07.280\nIt comes down to what\npackages you've installed.\n\n998\n00:52:07.280 --> 00:52:11.250\nSo, if you've some of the fuse systems\ninstalled, you might support NTFS.\n\n999\n00:52:11.250 --> 00:52:13.451\nAnd so, you might see MKFS.NTFS.\n\n1000\n00:52:13.451 --> 00:52:15.700\nYou might have x-fad or\n\n1001\n00:52:15.700 --> 00:52:18.160\nwhatever, depending on\nthe packages you've installed.\n\n1002\n00:52:18.160 --> 00:52:20.040\nBut I did a base server install, and\n\n1003\n00:52:20.040 --> 00:52:23.400\nthese are the ones that are included\nhere in a base server, all right?\n\n1004\n00:52:23.400 --> 00:52:27.340\nNow, some of these are for compatibility\nwith other systems, MS-DOS for\n\n1005\n00:52:27.340 --> 00:52:28.128\nexample, right?\n\n1006\n00:52:28.128 --> 00:52:30.580\nThat's FAT-16, VFAT.\n\n1007\n00:52:30.580 --> 00:52:33.240\nBut the other ones are for Linux.\n\n1008\n00:52:33.240 --> 00:52:38.565\nAnd most modern Linux distributions\nuse EXT3 or ext4, right?\n\n1009\n00:52:38.565 --> 00:52:42.990\nThere's not a whole heck of a lot of\ndifference between the two, even ext2.\n\n1010\n00:52:42.990 --> 00:52:46.660\nThere's differences in how they\nhandle right cash and so on.\n\n1011\n00:52:46.660 --> 00:52:51.530\nBut you need to figure out which one your\nsystem performs most adequately with.\n\n1012\n00:52:51.530 --> 00:52:54.220\nAnd, really, it's your data\nthat's gonna determine that.\n\n1013\n00:52:54.220 --> 00:52:58.570\nAs a rule of thumb for me, what I\nnormally do is look at my other discs and\n\n1014\n00:52:58.570 --> 00:53:03.110\nsee how they're set up,\nand then kinda copy that.\n\n1015\n00:53:03.110 --> 00:53:03.950\nIt's what I do.\n\n1016\n00:53:03.950 --> 00:53:08.920\nSo, if you run the mount command,\nwhen you run mount, it'll show you\n\n1017\n00:53:08.920 --> 00:53:13.250\nthe other systems, or the drives that are\nmounted, and what they're formatted as.\n\n1018\n00:53:13.250 --> 00:53:18.020\nAnd so, I can see right here that lv_root,\nmy root drive, is formatted as ext4.\n\n1019\n00:53:18.020 --> 00:53:21.880\nSo, since it's already ext4, I'll probably\njust stick with that since that's what\n\n1020\n00:53:21.880 --> 00:53:23.590\nI've already got on the system.\n\n1021\n00:53:23.590 --> 00:53:26.730\nBut there are different\ncharacteristics for each file system.\n\n1022\n00:53:26.730 --> 00:53:29.510\nIt might make one more\nattractive than another.\n\n1023\n00:53:29.510 --> 00:53:32.780\nIt's not always a guarantee that the\nnewest version is gonna be the best for\n\n1024\n00:53:32.780 --> 00:53:35.270\nyou because there's\ncertain database scenarios\n\n1025\n00:53:35.270 --> 00:53:38.680\nwhere EXT3 can actually give you\na little bit better performance.\n\n1026\n00:53:38.680 --> 00:53:39.790\nIt's very specialized, though.\n\n1027\n00:53:41.510 --> 00:53:42.040\nAll right.\n\n1028\n00:53:42.040 --> 00:53:43.830\nSo, I need to format my volume group.\n\n1029\n00:53:43.830 --> 00:53:49.644\nNow, if I wasn't doing the lvm,\nwhat I would do is I would say mkfs.ext4,\n\n1030\n00:53:49.644 --> 00:53:54.110\nand then I would point right at\nthe partition that I was gonna format.\n\n1031\n00:53:54.110 --> 00:54:00.090\nAnd I would just jump in there and\nsay /dev/sdb1, right?\n\n1032\n00:54:00.090 --> 00:54:03.430\nThat would format\nthe partition without the LVM.\n\n1033\n00:54:03.430 --> 00:54:05.890\nAnd then, I could mount it and go, right?\n\n1034\n00:54:05.890 --> 00:54:10.040\nBut because I have the LVM, I don't\nwanna format that partition, right?\n\n1035\n00:54:10.040 --> 00:54:11.150\nThat would be bad.\n\n1036\n00:54:11.150 --> 00:54:13.610\nI need to format the logical volume.\n\n1037\n00:54:13.610 --> 00:54:19.170\nSo, I need to format /dev/vg1,\nthat's the volume group.\n\n1038\n00:54:19.170 --> 00:54:23.640\nAnd then, inside of it, lv1,\nthat's the logical volume, all right?\n\n1039\n00:54:23.640 --> 00:54:27.580\nIt's one of the few things that's\ngonna have a subdirectory under /dev.\n\n1040\n00:54:27.580 --> 00:54:28.599\nYou don't see that all that often.\n\n1041\n00:54:28.599 --> 00:54:32.802\nSo, /dev/vg1/lv1.\n\n1042\n00:54:32.802 --> 00:54:37.720\nAnd by saying mkfs.ext4, that's me\ntelling it what file system to format.\n\n1043\n00:54:39.120 --> 00:54:40.280\nAll right.\nThere it goes.\n\n1044\n00:54:40.280 --> 00:54:43.075\nLot of output on the screen\nas it goes to format.\n\n1045\n00:54:43.075 --> 00:54:45.190\nThe bigger the drive,\nthe longer it will take.\n\n1046\n00:54:45.190 --> 00:54:48.680\nMine was 70 gigs and\nit partitioned out very, very fast.\n\n1047\n00:54:48.680 --> 00:54:49.250\nAll right?\n\n1048\n00:54:49.250 --> 00:54:52.860\nSo, it's gonna format it, and hopefully\nyou don't see and crazy errors in there.\n\n1049\n00:54:52.860 --> 00:54:54.440\nMine's fine.\nIt's telling me it's going to\n\n1050\n00:54:54.440 --> 00:54:57.070\nautomatically check it for\nerrors every 22 mounts,\n\n1051\n00:54:57.070 --> 00:55:01.450\n22 reboots, or every 180 days,\nwhich ever comes first, right?\n\n1052\n00:55:01.450 --> 00:55:04.978\nWhich, on a Linux system, it'll normally\nbe the 180 days that comes first.\n\n1053\n00:55:04.978 --> 00:55:07.770\nYeah, you don't, well, I guess maybe it's\na laptop or a desktop, you hit it sooner.\n\n1054\n00:55:07.770 --> 00:55:11.760\nBut on a server, it's pretty rare\nthat you reboot if you don't have to.\n\n1055\n00:55:13.200 --> 00:55:14.660\nSo, it's there, we're formatted.\n\n1056\n00:55:14.660 --> 00:55:16.300\nRight?\nWe're formatted and we're in business.\n\n1057\n00:55:16.300 --> 00:55:16.900\nWe're ready to go.\n\n1058\n00:55:16.900 --> 00:55:17.630\nRight?\n\n1059\n00:55:17.630 --> 00:55:21.030\nWell, we still don't really\nhave a way to get to that disk.\n\n1060\n00:55:21.030 --> 00:55:22.890\nAnd so,\nthat's where the mounting part comes in.\n\n1061\n00:55:22.890 --> 00:55:25.230\nWe need to mount it to have access to it.\n\n1062\n00:55:25.230 --> 00:55:26.310\nAll right.\n\n1063\n00:55:26.310 --> 00:55:28.170\nSo, we're gonna see that here in a minute.\n\n1064\n00:55:28.170 --> 00:55:30.275\nOr, actually,\nI guess I could do it right now.\n\n1065\n00:55:30.275 --> 00:55:34.000\nSo, here I am in my home directory.\n\n1066\n00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:38.854\nAnd let's say that I'm gonna be\nworking with a lot of videos, and\n\n1067\n00:55:38.854 --> 00:55:44.251\nI want these videos to be part of some\nother drive, this logical volume.\n\n1068\n00:55:44.251 --> 00:55:46.043\nThat's where I want them stored, okay?\n\n1069\n00:55:46.043 --> 00:55:51.752\nWell, I can make a directory called\nVideos, and then I could mount the disk.\n\n1070\n00:55:51.752 --> 00:55:54.776\nNow, when I mount it,\nremember that syntax we saw earlier?\n\n1071\n00:55:54.776 --> 00:55:58.609\nThere’s an alias in place for\nus with the mapper.\n\n1072\n00:55:58.609 --> 00:56:01.512\nSo when we mount it,\nwe can mount it using the mapper and\n\n1073\n00:56:01.512 --> 00:56:04.500\nthat's what gonna be tying\nall of this together.\n\n1074\n00:56:04.500 --> 00:56:06.007\nSo we'll just say mount.\n\n1075\n00:56:06.007 --> 00:56:10.386\nActually, I guess we don't really\nhave to use that, we could use, well,\n\n1076\n00:56:10.386 --> 00:56:12.692\nwe'll use the mapper here in a minute.\n\n1077\n00:56:12.692 --> 00:56:17.774\nSo I'll mount directly to that,\nand then I'll put the path as\n\n1078\n00:56:17.774 --> 00:56:23.152\nmy home directory /Videos, and\nthat's gonna mount the drive,\n\n1079\n00:56:23.152 --> 00:56:28.859\n/dev/vg1/lv1, to my home directory,\n/Videos, all right.\n\n1080\n00:56:28.859 --> 00:56:33.905\nNow, if I change into the Videos folder,\nwell, I don't really see much in there.\n\n1081\n00:56:33.905 --> 00:56:36.170\nThere's a little lost and\nfound directory and that's it.\n\n1082\n00:56:36.170 --> 00:56:38.860\nSo I probably need to copy at least\na little bit of data in there.\n\n1083\n00:56:40.260 --> 00:56:46.538\nSo let me copy like VMwareTools and\nI'll call it.\n\n1084\n00:56:46.538 --> 00:56:47.550\nYeah.\n\n1085\n00:56:47.550 --> 00:56:49.160\nSo I'm just gonna throw\nsome files in here.\n\n1086\n00:56:50.450 --> 00:56:56.190\nI'm just generating fake junk data,\nand we'll pretend that they're videos.\n\n1087\n00:56:56.190 --> 00:56:57.776\nThere we go, all right.\n\n1088\n00:56:57.776 --> 00:57:02.859\nSo I just copied a quick 250 MB\nof data into the disk, all right?\n\n1089\n00:57:02.859 --> 00:57:05.067\nHow do I really know that\nwent to the logical volume?\n\n1090\n00:57:05.067 --> 00:57:07.359\nHow do I know it went to a different disk?\n\n1091\n00:57:07.359 --> 00:57:12.109\nFrom here, if I look at my present working\ndirectory, I just see /root/Videos.\n\n1092\n00:57:12.109 --> 00:57:13.527\nI'm logged in as root.\n\n1093\n00:57:13.527 --> 00:57:16.300\nSo that's what I see right there,\nand then that's it.\n\n1094\n00:57:16.300 --> 00:57:23.442\nWell, if I do df -h, because the drive\nis mounted, it'll show up in df now.\n\n1095\n00:57:23.442 --> 00:57:26.234\nAnd I can see right here.\n\n1096\n00:57:26.234 --> 00:57:27.890\nWhoops, let me move that up.\n\n1097\n00:57:27.890 --> 00:57:32.640\nI can see right here at the bottom\nthat I've got /root/Videos.\n\n1098\n00:57:32.640 --> 00:57:35.636\nAnd that,\nthat is tied to the volume group, and see,\n\n1099\n00:57:35.636 --> 00:57:37.443\nit changed to the mapper for me?\n\n1100\n00:57:37.443 --> 00:57:41.916\nSo, when I mounted it I\ncould have used either one,\n\n1101\n00:57:41.916 --> 00:57:47.442\n/dev/vg1/lv1 or\n/dev/mapper/vg1- lv1, right.\n\n1102\n00:57:47.442 --> 00:57:50.870\nSo, that is kinda interchangeable\nwhich one you wanna use.\n\n1103\n00:57:50.870 --> 00:57:54.650\nIf you've actually named out your drives,\nthat mapper,\n\n1104\n00:57:54.650 --> 00:57:56.612\nit might be a little more easy to use.\n\n1105\n00:57:56.612 --> 00:58:00.260\nFor me, the names are nice and short, so\nit was actually shorter the other way.\n\n1106\n00:58:00.260 --> 00:58:06.130\nBut you can specify that out, and\nI can see it's 69 gigs here, it's 70 gigs.\n\n1107\n00:58:06.130 --> 00:58:10.859\nAnd I'm currently using 414 MB,\nthat's more than I thought.\n\n1108\n00:58:10.859 --> 00:58:12.676\nAnd I'm only 1% full, so\n\n1109\n00:58:12.676 --> 00:58:17.900\nI can see that that data is indeed being\nwritten to the lv, the logical volume.\n\n1110\n00:58:17.900 --> 00:58:18.567\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1111\n00:58:18.567 --> 00:58:21.928\nAll right.\nSo, Don, so you did mention that we can\n\n1112\n00:58:21.928 --> 00:58:26.317\nadd another drive here\n[CROSSTALK] to this volume group-\n\n1113\n00:58:26.317 --> 00:58:27.942\n>> Yeah.\n\n1114\n00:58:27.942 --> 00:58:29.277\n>> Right.\nSo I got 70 gigs.\n\n1115\n00:58:29.277 --> 00:58:31.690\nSo, boy,\nwe start throwing videos in there, right?\n\n1116\n00:58:31.690 --> 00:58:33.530\nAnd we fill that up pretty fast.\n\n1117\n00:58:33.530 --> 00:58:36.401\nHow many episodes is that for\nus, that's not even one.\n\n1118\n00:58:36.401 --> 00:58:37.750\n>> 70 gigs?\n\n1119\n00:58:37.750 --> 00:58:40.300\nAfter a conversion they come\nout about a gig a piece.\n\n1120\n00:58:40.300 --> 00:58:42.270\n>> All right, so\nthat would be quite a few.\n\n1121\n00:58:42.270 --> 00:58:43.940\nNot an entire certification, though.\n\n1122\n00:58:43.940 --> 00:58:47.230\nSo if we have an entire cert that\nwe want to throw in there, well,\n\n1123\n00:58:47.230 --> 00:58:49.570\nit's gonna fill that up,\nso we need more space.\n\n1124\n00:58:49.570 --> 00:58:52.930\nWell, if this was\na traditional partition and\n\n1125\n00:58:52.930 --> 00:58:55.120\nwe filled the whole drive,\nwe're out of luck.\n\n1126\n00:58:55.120 --> 00:58:58.830\nYou buy a new drive, partition it,\nand then copy your data over, right?\n\n1127\n00:58:58.830 --> 00:58:59.980\nThat's what you do.\n\n1128\n00:58:59.980 --> 00:59:04.623\nBut with a logical volume, I can expand it\nand add that extra physical disk in and\n\n1129\n00:59:04.623 --> 00:59:05.470\nthen grow it.\n\n1130\n00:59:05.470 --> 00:59:08.910\nSo I've got that extra disk for\nthat exact purpose, all right.\n\n1131\n00:59:08.910 --> 00:59:11.500\nSo step one,\nI just need to create a partition on it.\n\n1132\n00:59:11.500 --> 00:59:12.359\nAnd I've already done that.\n\n1133\n00:59:12.359 --> 00:59:18.937\nIf I do fdisk- l /dev/sdd,\nI can see where I created sdd-1 and\n\n1134\n00:59:18.937 --> 00:59:23.859\nit's just sitting there and\nthat's it, okay.\n\n1135\n00:59:23.859 --> 00:59:28.335\nThen I can add that into the lvm.\n\n1136\n00:59:28.335 --> 00:59:32.255\nWell, remember that first\ncommand that we ran, pvcreate.\n\n1137\n00:59:32.255 --> 00:59:35.901\nI need the lvm to know that\nit's okay to use this disk.\n\n1138\n00:59:35.901 --> 00:59:43.192\nAnd so I'm gonna run that pvcreate,\nand point it to /dev/sdd1, all right.\n\n1139\n00:59:43.192 --> 00:59:45.120\nNow it knows that it's\nallowed to use the disk.\n\n1140\n00:59:46.300 --> 00:59:50.970\nThen, I need to tell the volume group that\nthis disk is a part of that volume group.\n\n1141\n00:59:50.970 --> 00:59:53.442\nI have to assign it to the volume group.\n\n1142\n00:59:53.442 --> 00:59:57.401\nAnd before we used vgcreate, but\nwe're not creating a volume group.\n\n1143\n00:59:57.401 --> 00:59:58.860\nIt already exists.\n\n1144\n00:59:58.860 --> 01:00:02.317\nSo now we're gonna use vgextend.\n\n1145\n01:00:02.317 --> 01:00:07.100\nWe're gonna extend the volume group\nto include a new disk, all right.\n\n1146\n01:00:07.100 --> 01:00:13.275\nAnd it's vg1 and\nwe're adding /dev/sdd1, all right.\n\n1147\n01:00:13.275 --> 01:00:16.902\nSo that's gonna grow the volume\ngroup to encompass this new disk.\n\n1148\n01:00:16.902 --> 01:00:18.980\nSo there it goes, now it's extended.\n\n1149\n01:00:20.320 --> 01:00:25.926\nIf I do vgdisplay, and I come in here and\nI'll look at volume group 1,\n\n1150\n01:00:25.926 --> 01:00:32.400\nI can see that volume group o1 now has\n3 disks in it, right, 3 metadata areas.\n\n1151\n01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:36.276\nAnd I can see it's a hundred and,\nlet's say, 108 gigs in size.\n\n1152\n01:00:36.276 --> 01:00:39.078\nSo now it's grown to\nencompass those 3 disks.\n\n1153\n01:00:39.078 --> 01:00:42.135\nBut my logical volume hasn't grown.\n\n1154\n01:00:42.135 --> 01:00:49.775\nIf I do lvdisplay, I can see my\nlogical volume is still 70 gigs.\n\n1155\n01:00:49.775 --> 01:00:53.135\nSo I need to tell the logical volume\nthat it's okay to grow also to\n\n1156\n01:00:53.135 --> 01:00:54.395\nfill up that space.\n\n1157\n01:00:54.395 --> 01:00:58.151\nWell, unfortunately, this is one of those\ncases where the commands aren't the same.\n\n1158\n01:00:58.151 --> 01:01:03.775\nSo we did vgextend, but you do lvresize.\n\n1159\n01:01:03.775 --> 01:01:05.942\nGod forbid it was extend.\n\n1160\n01:01:05.942 --> 01:01:07.550\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And the reason it's resized\n\n1161\n01:01:07.550 --> 01:01:09.100\nis that you can shrink as well.\n\n1162\n01:01:09.100 --> 01:01:11.684\nYou wouldn't extend\nsomething to be smaller, but\n\n1163\n01:01:11.684 --> 01:01:13.734\nyou can resize to be smaller if you want.\n\n1164\n01:01:13.734 --> 01:01:14.775\nSo, I'm gonna resize.\n\n1165\n01:01:14.775 --> 01:01:20.234\nSo I'm gonna do lvresize, and\nthen you say -L to tell it the size.\n\n1166\n01:01:20.234 --> 01:01:21.026\n>> Whoops.\n\n1167\n01:01:21.026 --> 01:01:23.360\n>> Bear with me,\nI'm gonna need that space, thank you.\n\n1168\n01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:26.370\nAnd then I'm adding,\nnot subtracting, right?\n\n1169\n01:01:26.370 --> 01:01:30.110\nSo I'm gonna add 35 gigs more, okay.\n\n1170\n01:01:30.110 --> 01:01:34.930\nSo we had two 35 gig ones in the first\nplace, now I'm adding another 35 gigs.\n\n1171\n01:01:34.930 --> 01:01:40.651\nAnd I need to tell it where to get it\nfrom, or where I'm doing this, right?\n\n1172\n01:01:40.651 --> 01:01:46.317\nSo /dev/vg1/lv1.\n\n1173\n01:01:46.317 --> 01:01:50.080\nSo take that logical volume and\nadd 35 gigs more to it.\n\n1174\n01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:51.730\nNow where's the 35 gigs gonna come from?\n\n1175\n01:01:51.730 --> 01:01:52.910\nI didn't tell it that.\n\n1176\n01:01:52.910 --> 01:01:54.400\nWell, it's gonna come\nfrom the volume group.\n\n1177\n01:01:54.400 --> 01:01:57.150\nThe volume group already\nhas the extra space in it,\n\n1178\n01:01:57.150 --> 01:01:59.590\nthe logical volume will\nnow be able to grab it.\n\n1179\n01:01:59.590 --> 01:02:00.850\nSo it grabs it.\n\n1180\n01:02:00.850 --> 01:02:01.660\nThere we go.\n\n1181\n01:02:01.660 --> 01:02:03.940\nLogical volume is now extended\nto 105 gigs, all right.\n\n1182\n01:02:05.170 --> 01:02:06.850\nBut we're not quite done yet.\n\n1183\n01:02:06.850 --> 01:02:10.310\nThe logical volume is kind of\nlike the partition for us,\n\n1184\n01:02:10.310 --> 01:02:11.550\nand it's now 105 gigs in size.\n\n1185\n01:02:12.600 --> 01:02:15.350\nBut if I look at the partition itself,\nif I do df -h,\n\n1186\n01:02:15.350 --> 01:02:20.540\nI can see that that disk is still showing\nup as 69, roughly 70 gigs, all right?\n\n1187\n01:02:21.780 --> 01:02:25.670\nAnd that's because I formatted it ext4,\nand\n\n1188\n01:02:25.670 --> 01:02:29.530\nat that time it was 69 gigs,\nthat's the size of it.\n\n1189\n01:02:29.530 --> 01:02:31.240\nSo I need to extend that also.\n\n1190\n01:02:31.240 --> 01:02:32.880\nSee, it's this long process.\n\n1191\n01:02:32.880 --> 01:02:38.040\nWe extend the volume group,\nthen we extend the logical volume,\n\n1192\n01:02:38.040 --> 01:02:41.800\nand now we have to extend\nthe partition itself, all right?\n\n1193\n01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:44.930\nSo to do that,\nwe need to use a different command.\n\n1194\n01:02:44.930 --> 01:02:50.220\nWe say resizefs, so\nwe're resizing that file system, and\n\n1195\n01:02:50.220 --> 01:02:53.450\nsorry, it's resize2fs, there we go.\n\n1196\n01:02:53.450 --> 01:03:01.512\nAnd then we'll say /dev/vg1/lv1, so\nthat's the one that we wanna resize.\n\n1197\n01:03:01.512 --> 01:03:03.020\nNow, resize2fs,\n\n1198\n01:03:03.020 --> 01:03:07.000\nit takes a lot of command line operators\nif we wanna resize to a certain value.\n\n1199\n01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.910\nBut if we just want it to grow\nto fill all available space,\n\n1200\n01:03:09.910 --> 01:03:11.500\nwe don't need any command parameters.\n\n1201\n01:03:11.500 --> 01:03:14.067\nYou can just press Enter [SOUND] and\nit does it.\n\n1202\n01:03:14.067 --> 01:03:15.475\nYou gotta make that sound too,\nthat makes it work better.\n\n1203\n01:03:15.475 --> 01:03:19.180\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] So it's gonna grow.\n\n1204\n01:03:19.180 --> 01:03:22.350\nNotice it says it's doing a online resize.\n\n1205\n01:03:22.350 --> 01:03:24.560\nYou can do this while it's online and\npeople are in there.\n\n1206\n01:03:24.560 --> 01:03:28.290\nPerformance does degrade a little bit,\ncuz this is a heavy IO operation, but\n\n1207\n01:03:28.290 --> 01:03:29.190\nit happens pretty quick.\n\n1208\n01:03:29.190 --> 01:03:32.842\nYou saw it didn't take very long,\nand when it's done,\n\n1209\n01:03:32.842 --> 01:03:35.027\nnow we should have a larger disk.\n\n1210\n01:03:35.027 --> 01:03:39.437\nBefore, we showed as 69 gigs,\n\n1211\n01:03:39.437 --> 01:03:44.168\nnow we show as 104 gigs, right.\n\n1212\n01:03:44.168 --> 01:03:46.990\nSo now we've actually grown, and\nwe can store more data in there.\n\n1213\n01:03:46.990 --> 01:03:48.002\n>> Hm.\n\n1214\n01:03:48.002 --> 01:03:48.959\n>> All right?\n\n1215\n01:03:48.959 --> 01:03:50.210\nWe can do it while it's online.\n\n1216\n01:03:50.210 --> 01:03:51.583\nNot so bad.\n\n1217\n01:03:51.583 --> 01:03:55.377\nThis is a little harder than the rest of\nit cuz it was three different commands.\n\n1218\n01:03:55.377 --> 01:03:59.878\nWe had to add the physical disk and\nthrow it in the volume group.\n\n1219\n01:03:59.878 --> 01:04:04.376\nWe had to extend the volume group,\nwe had to resize the logical volume and\n\n1220\n01:04:04.376 --> 01:04:08.090\nwe have to resize the file system so\na couple of steps there.\n\n1221\n01:04:08.090 --> 01:04:10.508\nAnd just like in the other episodes,\nI've got my little show notes.\n\n1222\n01:04:10.508 --> 01:04:16.240\nI'll post with the episodes, so you'll\nhave those commands for your reference.\n\n1223\n01:04:16.240 --> 01:04:19.320\nNow are we done?\n\n1224\n01:04:19.320 --> 01:04:19.960\nActually, I think we are.\n\n1225\n01:04:19.960 --> 01:04:21.560\nAren't we?\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1226\n01:04:21.560 --> 01:04:22.580\n>> Have we missed anything?\n\n1227\n01:04:22.580 --> 01:04:25.867\nWe've got a partition, we mounted it,\n\n1228\n01:04:25.867 --> 01:04:30.618\nI copied some files to it\nI'm forgetting something.\n\n1229\n01:04:30.618 --> 01:04:33.490\nLet me show you guys something\nthat's an easy mistake to make.\n\n1230\n01:04:33.490 --> 01:04:35.568\nThis is mounted, I'm ready to rock.\n\n1231\n01:04:35.568 --> 01:04:39.268\nThings are going great,\nthings are looking up.\n\n1232\n01:04:39.268 --> 01:04:42.818\nWell, so I'm working on my videos,\nI copy a bunch of stuff there.\n\n1233\n01:04:42.818 --> 01:04:44.750\nIt's awesome, things are great.\n\n1234\n01:04:44.750 --> 01:04:47.680\nAnd then I say to myself,\nI need to do some updates.\n\n1235\n01:04:47.680 --> 01:04:52.578\nAnd so I go and I do my yum update,\nand I get some updates.\n\n1236\n01:04:52.578 --> 01:04:55.188\nThere apparently aren't any,\nand one of them is the kernel.\n\n1237\n01:04:55.188 --> 01:04:56.028\nAnd I go ooh, you know what?\n\n1238\n01:04:56.028 --> 01:04:57.220\nI need to reboot.\n\n1239\n01:04:57.220 --> 01:04:58.960\nSo I go ahead and reboot.\n\n1240\n01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:03.760\nWell when I reboot, my system reboots and\nif I watch it boot up.\n\n1241\n01:05:03.760 --> 01:05:05.580\nIf I can look really fast.\n\n1242\n01:05:05.580 --> 01:05:06.738\nI'll see it fine, the logical volumes.\n\n1243\n01:05:06.738 --> 01:05:10.058\nSee there it goes two logical volumes\nin volume group whatever unmonitored.\n\n1244\n01:05:10.058 --> 01:05:13.711\nIt's going through and\nit's gonna mount the logical volumes,\n\n1245\n01:05:13.711 --> 01:05:18.118\nwell it's gonna recognize them and\nsee them, and see all this information.\n\n1246\n01:05:18.118 --> 01:05:21.960\nAnd then when it gets up,\nI'm gonna notice a problem.\n\n1247\n01:05:21.960 --> 01:05:24.301\nThe problem will be that my\ndrives have disappeared or\n\n1248\n01:05:24.301 --> 01:05:25.818\nat least my data has disappeared.\n\n1249\n01:05:25.818 --> 01:05:28.468\nAnd I'll show you what I\nmean by that in a second.\n\n1250\n01:05:28.468 --> 01:05:30.508\nIt'll freak you out\nthe first time it happens.\n\n1251\n01:05:30.508 --> 01:05:35.940\nSo if you're new to Linux, this is\nsomething that happens to a lot of people.\n\n1252\n01:05:35.940 --> 01:05:37.720\nAnd so I'm just gonna boot up.\n\n1253\n01:05:37.720 --> 01:05:39.840\nAnd so here I am in my directory.\n\n1254\n01:05:39.840 --> 01:05:44.150\nI go into Videos and\nall my videos are gone.\n\n1255\n01:05:44.150 --> 01:05:45.018\nThis is freak out moment.\n\n1256\n01:05:45.018 --> 01:05:46.498\nI just lost all my episodes!\n\n1257\n01:05:46.498 --> 01:05:48.338\nWhat the heck?\n\n1258\n01:05:48.338 --> 01:05:52.520\nThe problem is the mount\ncommand is temporary.\n\n1259\n01:05:52.520 --> 01:05:57.110\nRemember I mounted this by saying mount\n\n1260\n01:05:57.110 --> 01:06:01.288\n/dev/vg1/1v1 -/videos.\n\n1261\n01:06:01.288 --> 01:06:05.441\nI attach that logical\nvolume to that folder and\n\n1262\n01:06:05.441 --> 01:06:09.068\nwhen I did that, there's everything.\n\n1263\n01:06:09.068 --> 01:06:12.800\nBut when you reboot,\neverything that you mounted goes away.\n\n1264\n01:06:12.800 --> 01:06:17.638\nThe mount gets removed and the system\ndoesn't know to put it back again.\n\n1265\n01:06:17.638 --> 01:06:20.480\nWell if this was a temporary operation,\nthat's fine.\n\n1266\n01:06:20.480 --> 01:06:22.960\nBut if this was something you\nwere gonna use long term,\n\n1267\n01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:24.870\nyou need it to be there\nevery time you boot.\n\n1268\n01:06:26.460 --> 01:06:33.680\nWell, Linux maintains a file called fstab,\nthat's the file system table.\n\n1269\n01:06:33.680 --> 01:06:38.680\nAnd it's basically, a set of instructions\non what to mount when the system boots.\n\n1270\n01:06:38.680 --> 01:06:44.968\nAnd if I look at it Oops,\ndoing my Windows commands again.\n\n1271\n01:06:47.868 --> 01:06:51.618\nSo if I look at my file system table,\nit's /etc/fstab,\n\n1272\n01:06:51.618 --> 01:06:56.930\nI can see all the file systems that'll\nbe mounted when we boot the system up.\n\n1273\n01:06:56.930 --> 01:07:00.880\nAnd so I can see in here,\nhere is lv_root and\n\n1274\n01:07:00.880 --> 01:07:04.810\nit is being mounted in the /,\nthe root folder.\n\n1275\n01:07:04.810 --> 01:07:08.280\nIts ext4, and so it knows to boot it.\n\n1276\n01:07:08.280 --> 01:07:11.620\nAnd the swap same thing, that the swap\npartition, it knows to mount it.\n\n1277\n01:07:11.620 --> 01:07:14.350\nHere's some of the other\nones that it knows to mount.\n\n1278\n01:07:14.350 --> 01:07:16.290\nI don't see my videos in there,\n\n1279\n01:07:16.290 --> 01:07:20.240\nso videos are not a part of this,\nit doesn't know to mount them.\n\n1280\n01:07:20.240 --> 01:07:24.899\nSo I need to add that to this file,\nyou do need to be a root user or have root\n\n1281\n01:07:24.899 --> 01:07:29.978\nauthority to do it, and I'm logged in\nas root which is not the best practice.\n\n1282\n01:07:29.978 --> 01:07:32.222\nWe'll see in the security\nepisode how I should do this,\n\n1283\n01:07:32.222 --> 01:07:33.473\nI just don't wanna-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1284\n01:07:33.473 --> 01:07:34.234\n>> Get all confused on that\n\n1285\n01:07:34.234 --> 01:07:35.270\nstuff right now.\n\n1286\n01:07:35.270 --> 01:07:36.830\nBut we just need to add an entry, and\n\n1287\n01:07:36.830 --> 01:07:38.160\nentries are actually\npretty straight forward.\n\n1288\n01:07:38.160 --> 01:07:40.270\nIt looks really complex but it isn't.\n\n1289\n01:07:40.270 --> 01:07:44.670\nThe first part is the name of\nthe disc that you want to mount.\n\n1290\n01:07:44.670 --> 01:07:47.790\nThe second part is where\nyou want to mount it.\n\n1291\n01:07:47.790 --> 01:07:50.249\nThe third part is what\nfile system it uses.\n\n1292\n01:07:51.270 --> 01:07:55.608\nAnd then the fourth part is any\ncustom flags you wanna attach to it.\n\n1293\n01:07:55.608 --> 01:07:58.956\nSome partitions have special needs\nlike disabling the write back cache or\n\n1294\n01:07:58.956 --> 01:08:01.040\nwhatever, and you'd specify that.\n\n1295\n01:08:01.040 --> 01:08:02.639\nMost of the time we just say, defaults.\n\n1296\n01:08:04.270 --> 01:08:08.390\nThen the last two values indicate,\nwell this first one wether or\n\n1297\n01:08:08.390 --> 01:08:10.890\nnot the drive should be backed up.\n\n1298\n01:08:10.890 --> 01:08:13.469\nWe don't need to backup\nevery drive like a CD drive.\n\n1299\n01:08:13.469 --> 01:08:15.080\nNo point backing that up.\n\n1300\n01:08:15.080 --> 01:08:18.080\nSo if you're unmounting your CD drive\nhere, you will leave backup as 0 or\n\n1301\n01:08:18.080 --> 01:08:20.230\nyour swap, put partition?\n\n1302\n01:08:20.230 --> 01:08:22.308\nNo need to back it up so you do a 0.\n\n1303\n01:08:22.308 --> 01:08:26.360\nAnd then the next one is should\nyou check it for errors?\n\n1304\n01:08:26.360 --> 01:08:30.510\nAnd on root, yeah it's a one, you want\nto check that for errors when you boot.\n\n1305\n01:08:30.510 --> 01:08:32.090\nBut these other guys like swap?\n\n1306\n01:08:32.090 --> 01:08:34.695\nSwap gets erased every time you\nboot at least it should, so\n\n1307\n01:08:34.695 --> 01:08:37.258\nno point checking it for\nerrors or your tmpfs, and so on.\n\n1308\n01:08:37.258 --> 01:08:39.570\nSo that's what those values mean.\n\n1309\n01:08:39.570 --> 01:08:41.978\nIf you're ever in doubt,\nyou can just copy the one from root and\n\n1310\n01:08:41.978 --> 01:08:43.578\nit's gonna be pretty much what you need.\n\n1311\n01:08:43.578 --> 01:08:45.610\nBut that's what each\nof those values means.\n\n1312\n01:08:45.610 --> 01:08:48.860\nAnd so we're just gonna stick with\nthat as we go through and populate it.\n\n1313\n01:08:48.860 --> 01:08:50.759\nSo I'm going to fire up my trusty vi.\n\n1314\n01:08:52.490 --> 01:08:55.560\nAnd we're gonna go into the file here, and\n\n1315\n01:08:55.560 --> 01:08:58.899\nwe can pop it in pretty\nmuch anywhere you want.\n\n1316\n01:08:58.899 --> 01:09:02.800\nI like to keep my usable drives\nup towards the top though.\n\n1317\n01:09:02.800 --> 01:09:05.010\nSo it is kind of up to you,\nhow you want to go about that.\n\n1318\n01:09:05.010 --> 01:09:08.450\nSo I'm just gonna insert right\nbefore this thing, with my boot.\n\n1319\n01:09:08.450 --> 01:09:14.119\nAnd so I'm going to mount/dev/vg1/lv1,\n\n1320\n01:09:14.119 --> 01:09:19.228\nand you can try and\ntab to make it look nice.\n\n1321\n01:09:19.228 --> 01:09:24.600\nAnd so I'm gonna mount it into\nmy home directory/Videos.\n\n1322\n01:09:24.600 --> 01:09:30.550\nAnd it's going to be ext4,\nI'm gonna go with the defaults.\n\n1323\n01:09:30.550 --> 01:09:33.980\nI'm gonna tell it to go ahead and\nback it up, if we do backups.\n\n1324\n01:09:33.980 --> 01:09:38.910\nAnd I'll tell it, to check it for\nerrors in the event there's errors.\n\n1325\n01:09:38.910 --> 01:09:45.040\nSo I'm just putting that entry in and\nkind of getting that put in place.\n\n1326\n01:09:45.040 --> 01:09:49.310\nOnce that's done, and I just used tabs in\nbetween those, it's tabs to make it look\n\n1327\n01:09:49.310 --> 01:09:52.621\nnice, you can do spaces,\nthey don't have to line up like this.\n\n1328\n01:09:52.621 --> 01:09:57.681\nThe order is what's important,\nnot necessarily the space.\n\n1329\n01:09:57.681 --> 01:10:00.750\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and save that.\n\n1330\n01:10:00.750 --> 01:10:04.528\nAnd now if I were to reboot,\nwhen I reboot.\n\n1331\n01:10:04.528 --> 01:10:06.219\nYeah, it's gonna dismount\nthose logical volumes.\n\n1332\n01:10:07.360 --> 01:10:11.860\nBut when it boots back up it's gonna see\nthat I have that instruction in the file\n\n1333\n01:10:11.860 --> 01:10:15.060\nsystem table, and\nit'll know to go ahead and mount it again.\n\n1334\n01:10:16.150 --> 01:10:21.240\nSo we'll let it reboot here, and\nas soon as it gets in there we'll see it.\n\n1335\n01:10:21.240 --> 01:10:22.929\nAnd hopefully our videos\nwill be there when we boot.\n\n1336\n01:10:24.050 --> 01:10:26.645\nI remember the first time I\ndid this a long time ago, and\n\n1337\n01:10:26.645 --> 01:10:28.408\nI rebooted and all my stuff was gone.\n\n1338\n01:10:28.408 --> 01:10:30.648\nAnd it was just this sinking feeling-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1339\n01:10:30.648 --> 01:10:31.944\n>> In your stomach like,\n\n1340\n01:10:31.944 --> 01:10:33.108\nI lost all my stuff.\n\n1341\n01:10:33.108 --> 01:10:39.458\nAnd it's not gone, it's just not mounted.\n\n1342\n01:10:39.458 --> 01:10:45.438\n>> Well, let's take a gander at it.\n\n1343\n01:10:45.438 --> 01:10:46.440\n>> Here we go.\n\n1344\n01:10:46.440 --> 01:10:50.976\nMy videos are there, if I do a df -h,\nI can see the volume group,\n\n1345\n01:10:50.976 --> 01:10:52.488\nlogical volume one.\n\n1346\n01:10:52.488 --> 01:10:56.162\nIt's mounted, it knew to bring it up at\nboot time because I added it to the file\n\n1347\n01:10:56.162 --> 01:10:56.907\nsystem table.\n\n1348\n01:10:56.907 --> 01:10:59.590\nSo you got to remember to do that.\n\n1349\n01:10:59.590 --> 01:11:01.650\n>> Nice.\n\n1350\n01:11:01.650 --> 01:11:05.650\n>> When we're done with this stuff,\nwe can tear it down again.\n\n1351\n01:11:05.650 --> 01:11:09.080\nSo if we're not gonna need these things,\na lot of the commands are pretty much\n\n1352\n01:11:09.080 --> 01:11:13.320\nthe same commands we've already seen,\nexcept instead of create we use remove.\n\n1353\n01:11:13.320 --> 01:11:19.180\nSo you've got lv remove, vg remove,\npv remove to remove the logical volume,\n\n1354\n01:11:19.180 --> 01:11:21.660\nthe volume group, and the physical\nvolume to get them out of there.\n\n1355\n01:11:22.700 --> 01:11:26.890\nIf I want to get rid of this,\nif I'm done, well first off I need to get\n\n1356\n01:11:26.890 --> 01:11:30.860\nit out of the file system table otherwise\nI'm gonna get an error every time I boot.\n\n1357\n01:11:30.860 --> 01:11:33.689\nEvery time I boot it'll try and\nmount this, so I'm gonna get in here and\n\n1358\n01:11:33.689 --> 01:11:34.456\ndelete that line.\n\n1359\n01:11:38.459 --> 01:11:43.791\nAnd then I'm gonna say umount which\n\n1360\n01:11:43.791 --> 01:11:49.127\nis unmount, /dev/vg1/lv1.\n\n1361\n01:11:49.127 --> 01:11:53.252\nSo I'm gonna unmount it, and\nI can verify it's gone with df.\n\n1362\n01:11:53.252 --> 01:11:56.002\nSo I don't see videos there anymore.\n\n1363\n01:11:56.002 --> 01:11:59.290\nNow, the videos folder is still\nthere cuz it is just a folder.\n\n1364\n01:11:59.290 --> 01:12:01.178\nSo if I don't want that anymore,\nI can remove it.\n\n1365\n01:12:03.338 --> 01:12:06.410\nAll right and\nthen I can tear everything else down.\n\n1366\n01:12:06.410 --> 01:12:11.400\nI do lvremove /dev/vg1/lv1,\n\n1367\n01:12:11.400 --> 01:12:14.800\nso it's warning me about it.\n\n1368\n01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:16.730\nI'm sure I wanna get rid of it sure.\n\n1369\n01:12:17.940 --> 01:12:25.680\nAll right and then I do vgremove /dev/vg1,\nAnd it's gone.\n\n1370\n01:12:25.680 --> 01:12:31.708\nThen we can do pvremove and for\nthis one I got the three discs involved.\n\n1371\n01:12:31.708 --> 01:12:37.295\nSo sdb1, sdc1,\n\n1372\n01:12:37.295 --> 01:12:40.275\nAnd sdd 1, I could run it one\nat a time if I wanted, or\n\n1373\n01:12:40.275 --> 01:12:43.405\nyou can just combine them all\nlike that and it wipes them all.\n\n1374\n01:12:43.405 --> 01:12:45.825\nAnd so now they're removed and that's it.\n\n1375\n01:12:45.825 --> 01:12:49.085\nNow that whole logical\nvolume system is gone and\n\n1376\n01:12:49.085 --> 01:12:50.900\nI can use those discs for other things.\n\n1377\n01:12:50.900 --> 01:12:51.980\nNice.\n>> Now these\n\n1378\n01:12:51.980 --> 01:12:54.900\ndo look like a pretty\ngraceful way of doing it.\n\n1379\n01:12:54.900 --> 01:13:00.430\nI mean, could you just start with the PV\nremove and just rip it out from there?\n\n1380\n01:13:00.430 --> 01:13:01.420\n>> You could.\n\n1381\n01:13:01.420 --> 01:13:03.960\nIf you do it that way, right,\nif you don't go in order,\n\n1382\n01:13:03.960 --> 01:13:07.160\nthe reverse order of creating it,\nyou're gonna get errors, right?\n\n1383\n01:13:07.160 --> 01:13:10.240\nYou can pretty much ignore them,\ncuz you're removing the PV.\n\n1384\n01:13:10.240 --> 01:13:13.410\nBut the next time you boot, you might get\nerrors, cuz things aren't found and so on.\n\n1385\n01:13:13.410 --> 01:13:14.840\nSo it's not Clean.\n\n1386\n01:13:14.840 --> 01:13:17.720\nThe clean way to do it is to step through\nit, just like I did right there, and\n\n1387\n01:13:17.720 --> 01:13:19.580\nknock them out.\n\n1388\n01:13:19.580 --> 01:13:21.370\nThe biggest one is if you\nleave it in the fs tab.\n\n1389\n01:13:21.370 --> 01:13:24.420\nThat's where you get the most errors,\nlike sis log errors.\n\n1390\n01:13:24.420 --> 01:13:27.970\nCourse, if you're not monitoring\nyour system log, what do you care?\n\n1391\n01:13:27.970 --> 01:13:28.470\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But [LAUGH].\n\n1392\n01:13:28.470 --> 01:13:29.769\nBut yeah, that would be the negative.\n\n1393\n01:13:31.940 --> 01:13:36.398\nAll right, so that is creating discs,\ncreating partitions,\n\n1394\n01:13:36.398 --> 01:13:39.690\nformatting partitions, and mounting them.\n\n1395\n01:13:39.690 --> 01:13:42.660\nUsing the LVM and\ngetting those disc attached.\n\n1396\n01:13:43.860 --> 01:13:46.570\nThere is one more thing that I\nwant to talk about this episode.\n\n1397\n01:13:46.570 --> 01:13:48.060\nI mentioned doing backups.\n\n1398\n01:13:48.060 --> 01:13:51.530\nI want to talk about how to\ntake an image of a disc, and\n\n1399\n01:13:51.530 --> 01:13:56.650\nrestore that image if necessary so\nwe can save that or whatever.\n\n1400\n01:13:56.650 --> 01:13:59.450\nI definitely want to take a look at that.\n\n1401\n01:13:59.450 --> 01:14:00.740\nWe'll do that maybe after the break or\nsomething.\n\n1402\n01:14:00.740 --> 01:14:03.184\n>> Yup, sounds good.\n\n1403\n01:14:03.184 --> 01:14:06.570\n>> All right stay tuned,\nwe'll be back after this with disc backup.\n\n1404\n01:14:09.140 --> 01:14:14.960\n[SOUND] All right, welcome back everybody.\n\n1405\n01:14:14.960 --> 01:14:18.310\nSo in the last segment, right there at the\nend, you saw how quick and easy it was for\n\n1406\n01:14:18.310 --> 01:14:20.200\nme to destroy that partition, right?\n\n1407\n01:14:20.200 --> 01:14:23.230\nSo data loss is a real thing.\n\n1408\n01:14:23.230 --> 01:14:24.800\nRight?\nSo millions of Americans\n\n1409\n01:14:24.800 --> 01:14:26.345\nare affected by data loss every year.\n\n1410\n01:14:26.345 --> 01:14:30.710\n[LAUGH] And so, there's so many different\nways I could go with this, right?\n\n1411\n01:14:30.710 --> 01:14:32.710\nThere's some kind of pill for data loss.\n\n1412\n01:14:32.710 --> 01:14:35.580\nAnd so,\ndata loss is a real problem and, so,\n\n1413\n01:14:35.580 --> 01:14:37.430\nwe need to be able to back up our data.\n\n1414\n01:14:37.430 --> 01:14:39.400\nAnd there's a bunch of\nutilities that let you do it.\n\n1415\n01:14:39.400 --> 01:14:42.950\nI mean you could use tar to gather up\nyour stuff and use that for backups.\n\n1416\n01:14:42.950 --> 01:14:48.040\nThere's Bacula which is a backup program\nthat's open-source that you can use\n\n1417\n01:14:48.040 --> 01:14:48.770\nfor doing backups.\n\n1418\n01:14:48.770 --> 01:14:50.670\nThere's all sorts of stuff.\n\n1419\n01:14:50.670 --> 01:14:52.640\nBut, one of the oldest and\n\n1420\n01:14:52.640 --> 01:14:57.030\nmost powerful tools is called DD,\nwhich is the data duplicator.\n\n1421\n01:14:57.030 --> 01:15:01.080\nAnd what it lets you do Is\ntake a copy of an entire disk.\n\n1422\n01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:03.130\nBasically take an image of a disk.\n\n1423\n01:15:03.130 --> 01:15:04.790\nAnd it's great for two purposes.\n\n1424\n01:15:04.790 --> 01:15:09.140\nOne, for backing up, and two,\nfor rapidly cloning a machine.\n\n1425\n01:15:09.140 --> 01:15:12.470\nIf you want to have 20 servers\nyou can create one and\n\n1426\n01:15:12.470 --> 01:15:14.980\nclone it, and then dump those\nimages on the other systems.\n\n1427\n01:15:14.980 --> 01:15:18.100\nNow, there's plenty of third party\nsoftware that does it too, but\n\n1428\n01:15:18.100 --> 01:15:21.160\nit's kind of nice to have a command built\ninto the system that is ready to rock.\n\n1429\n01:15:21.160 --> 01:15:25.340\nSo, DD, that's the command, right?\n\n1430\n01:15:25.340 --> 01:15:30.190\n>> Yeah, and the DD writes,\nit takes a bit for bit image of this disk.\n\n1431\n01:15:30.190 --> 01:15:32.290\nYeah, it doesn't care what your\nfile system is, or anything.\n\n1432\n01:15:32.290 --> 01:15:33.400\nIt just, it grabs it all.\n\n1433\n01:15:33.400 --> 01:15:33.910\n>> Nice.\n\n1434\n01:15:33.910 --> 01:15:35.180\n>> So yeah, it's cool.\n\n1435\n01:15:35.180 --> 01:15:38.110\nThat makes it a little slower,\nbut it's very powerful.\n\n1436\n01:15:38.110 --> 01:15:41.220\nWell I mean, you have an Android phone,\nI have an Android phone.\n\n1437\n01:15:41.220 --> 01:15:44.240\nWe flash our phones,\ndifferent images and stuff on there.\n\n1438\n01:15:44.240 --> 01:15:48.060\nAnd those are almost always using\nDD underneath the hood to do that.\n\n1439\n01:15:48.060 --> 01:15:50.360\n>> Yeah?\n>> So yeah, yeah it's used all the time.\n\n1440\n01:15:50.360 --> 01:15:53.810\nSo it is a very common thing in\nthe UNIX Linux world, right?\n\n1441\n01:15:53.810 --> 01:15:56.480\nNot so much in other.\n\n1442\n01:15:56.480 --> 01:15:59.290\nSo, DD it's built in,\nit's part of the genu tool set.\n\n1443\n01:15:59.290 --> 01:16:01.850\nAnd so if we take our Linux box and\nwe just type that in.\n\n1444\n01:16:01.850 --> 01:16:07.320\nType in DD, then you'll see not much.\n\n1445\n01:16:07.320 --> 01:16:12.010\nBecause DD is expecting certain input and\noutput so it just sits there unhappy.\n\n1446\n01:16:12.010 --> 01:16:14.700\nIt was trying to copy,\nsee but it couldn't.\n\n1447\n01:16:14.700 --> 01:16:16.210\nBut if we pull up the main page for\n\n1448\n01:16:16.210 --> 01:16:19.970\nit you'll see some of the different things\nwe can do, and it's a little bit cryptic.\n\n1449\n01:16:19.970 --> 01:16:24.440\nSee the synopsis, dd option,\nor dd OPERAND, and that's it.\n\n1450\n01:16:24.440 --> 01:16:26.690\nSo it's not really giving you\na whole lot of clues here but\n\n1451\n01:16:26.690 --> 01:16:29.240\nthe commands really not that bad,\nit's just very powerful.\n\n1452\n01:16:29.240 --> 01:16:31.400\nYou can provide all\nsorts of data to it and\n\n1453\n01:16:31.400 --> 01:16:33.780\nget it to do all sorts of crazy things,\nall right.\n\n1454\n01:16:33.780 --> 01:16:35.980\nBut let's just see an example.\n\n1455\n01:16:35.980 --> 01:16:39.940\nSo during the break I went ahead\nan re-created my little videos drive.\n\n1456\n01:16:39.940 --> 01:16:45.680\nSo if I take a look at my DF output I\ncan see that I do have videos again and\n\n1457\n01:16:45.680 --> 01:16:50.110\nit's my I just went straight to STB I\ndidn't bother with the logical volume\n\n1458\n01:16:50.110 --> 01:16:53.860\nmanager, and so I've got it there and\nif I take a look at my videos folder,\n\n1459\n01:16:55.150 --> 01:16:57.240\nI've got nine videos in there and\nthey're ready to rock.\n\n1460\n01:16:57.240 --> 01:17:01.200\nNow this is important data to me,\nso I don't wanna lose it.\n\n1461\n01:17:01.200 --> 01:17:04.090\nI don't wanna lose\nthe information that's in there.\n\n1462\n01:17:04.090 --> 01:17:06.230\nSo I need to have a backup.\n\n1463\n01:17:06.230 --> 01:17:10.730\nAnd if I take a look at it,\nlet me do lah, there.\n\n1464\n01:17:10.730 --> 01:17:14.470\nIt looks like I have about\n526 MB of data in there and\n\n1465\n01:17:14.470 --> 01:17:15.770\nI don't wanna lose that information.\n\n1466\n01:17:15.770 --> 01:17:16.940\nSo I wanna back it up.\n\n1467\n01:17:16.940 --> 01:17:17.520\nAll right?\n\n1468\n01:17:17.520 --> 01:17:20.244\nI could just tar these files and\nsend them up.\n\n1469\n01:17:20.244 --> 01:17:22.920\nBut I want that whole disk,\nthat image of that disk.\n\n1470\n01:17:22.920 --> 01:17:28.080\nSo I'm gonna use DD to clone it,\nDD is pretty straightforward.\n\n1471\n01:17:28.080 --> 01:17:34.152\nWe say dd and then we tell it\nthe input file and the output file.\n\n1472\n01:17:34.152 --> 01:17:37.740\nAll right so I'm gonna start with ddis so\nthe input and\n\n1473\n01:17:37.740 --> 01:17:42.930\nI'm gonna say I'm inputting\nfrom slash dev slash sdb1.\n\n1474\n01:17:42.930 --> 01:17:44.940\nRight?\nThat's the disk where I'm getting my\n\n1475\n01:17:44.940 --> 01:17:48.410\ndata to and then I need to tell\nit where I want to put it.\n\n1476\n01:17:48.410 --> 01:17:51.570\nNow if I were cloning disks,\nI could go ahead and\n\n1477\n01:17:51.570 --> 01:17:56.880\nsay, output file = /dev/sdb2,\nall right, like that.\n\n1478\n01:17:56.880 --> 01:18:02.530\nAnd if I run that,\nit's gonna clone sdb1 over to sdb2,\n\n1479\n01:18:02.530 --> 01:18:04.788\nalthough there is no sdb2,\nI wonder what it did there?\n\n1480\n01:18:04.788 --> 01:18:05.950\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> No\n\n1481\n01:18:05.950 --> 01:18:07.840\n>> No space left on the device, okay.\n\n1482\n01:18:07.840 --> 01:18:12.490\nSo [LAUGH] for some reason, I don't know\nwhy, I forgot, I don't have an sdb2.\n\n1483\n01:18:12.490 --> 01:18:15.830\nSo if I take sdb1 and clone that to sdc1,\n\n1484\n01:18:15.830 --> 01:18:20.200\nthat I do have, Drive C, we wiped that\nout in the last show, or last segment.\n\n1485\n01:18:20.200 --> 01:18:23.470\nSo if I do that, it's gonna clone it, and\n\n1486\n01:18:23.470 --> 01:18:26.180\nnow that second drive will\nbe the same as the first.\n\n1487\n01:18:26.180 --> 01:18:32.590\nNow sdc1, at the end of the last show,\nI broke it out of the logical volume.\n\n1488\n01:18:32.590 --> 01:18:35.930\nBroke it out of volume group,\ntook it out of the LVM entirely.\n\n1489\n01:18:35.930 --> 01:18:37.260\nSo it did have a partition on it,\n\n1490\n01:18:37.260 --> 01:18:40.580\nbut it wasn't formatted I\nnever did format that one.\n\n1491\n01:18:40.580 --> 01:18:47.150\nSo it just clone that over and or\nit's in a process of cloning over and\n\n1492\n01:18:47.150 --> 01:18:52.270\nwhat is done I'll have a duplicate\nof that data in that other system.\n\n1493\n01:18:52.270 --> 01:18:52.880\nAll right?\n\n1494\n01:18:52.880 --> 01:18:54.250\nSo I can give it a moment,\n\n1495\n01:18:54.250 --> 01:18:56.470\nit's actually taking longer than\nI kind of assumed it would.\n\n1496\n01:18:56.470 --> 01:18:59.650\nBut, like we said,\nit is doing a bit level backup.\n\n1497\n01:18:59.650 --> 01:19:02.140\nNow be careful with your input and\n\n1498\n01:19:02.140 --> 01:19:05.250\noutput statements cuz if you get\nthem backwards what's gonna happen?\n\n1499\n01:19:05.250 --> 01:19:07.440\nYou could potentially erase your data.\n\n1500\n01:19:07.440 --> 01:19:09.070\nAnd if you erase your\ndata you're gonna be sad.\n\n1501\n01:19:09.070 --> 01:19:10.760\nSo we don't want that.\n\n1502\n01:19:10.760 --> 01:19:14.000\nNow that is taking an unusual\namount of time, isn't it?\n\n1503\n01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.780\n>> Yeah.\n>> Shouldn't take that long.\n\n1504\n01:19:18.350 --> 01:19:20.227\n>> Well it's our first time\nseeing this command, Don.\n\n1505\n01:19:20.227 --> 01:19:22.245\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> Well, I commented on\n\n1506\n01:19:22.245 --> 01:19:22.985\n>> On that fact that\n\n1507\n01:19:22.985 --> 01:19:23.825\nI hadn't formatted it.\n\n1508\n01:19:23.825 --> 01:19:25.275\nMaybe it's ticked off about that, but\n\n1509\n01:19:25.275 --> 01:19:28.023\nyeah it's shouldn't take this long jut for\n500 megs.\n\n1510\n01:19:28.023 --> 01:19:31.453\nAll right.\n\n1511\n01:19:31.453 --> 01:19:32.315\n>> Hm.\n\n1512\n01:19:32.315 --> 01:19:34.515\n>> Well let's try something\na little different here.\n\n1513\n01:19:34.515 --> 01:19:36.100\nSo there's a good way we can check\n>> Check this.\n\n1514\n01:19:36.100 --> 01:19:38.260\nThere could be a problem with SDC1.\n\n1515\n01:19:38.260 --> 01:19:43.190\nSo instead of backing up to a drive\nlike that, I could back up.\n\n1516\n01:19:43.190 --> 01:19:45.420\nI'm just gonna Ctrl+C to break out of it.\n\n1517\n01:19:45.420 --> 01:19:48.329\nAnd it says-\n>> You were done with SDC1,\n\n1518\n01:19:48.329 --> 01:19:50.777\nwe didn't have it mounted anywhere.\n\n1519\n01:19:50.777 --> 01:19:51.501\n>> Shoot, that's right.\n\n1520\n01:19:51.501 --> 01:19:52.877\nSo I forgot, okay.\n\n1521\n01:19:52.877 --> 01:19:54.626\nSo I used the Ctrl+C to break out.\n\n1522\n01:19:54.626 --> 01:19:57.293\nNow notice what it shows\non the Of here right.\n\n1523\n01:19:57.293 --> 01:20:00.544\nTwo point four gigabytes copied.\n\n1524\n01:20:00.544 --> 01:20:02.450\nIt was working.\n\n1525\n01:20:02.450 --> 01:20:04.020\nBut it's doing that bit level back up.\n\n1526\n01:20:04.020 --> 01:20:06.980\nNow I made that comment,\nI've only got 500 megs, right.\n\n1527\n01:20:06.980 --> 01:20:09.272\nI forgot it's a bit level back up.\n\n1528\n01:20:09.272 --> 01:20:14.358\nThat drive SDB1 or whatever,\nit was pretty big.\n\n1529\n01:20:14.358 --> 01:20:17.000\nIt's a 36 gig drive, right.\n\n1530\n01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.700\nSo that's a 36 gig partition, so\n\n1531\n01:20:19.700 --> 01:20:24.350\nit's actually copying 36 gigs of data,\nnot just 500 megs.\n\n1532\n01:20:24.350 --> 01:20:25.950\nCuz it's doing bit level.\n\n1533\n01:20:25.950 --> 01:20:27.110\nEven the empty bits.\n\n1534\n01:20:27.110 --> 01:20:28.610\nIt's copying those over.\n\n1535\n01:20:28.610 --> 01:20:30.600\nSo it is going to take a while.\n\n1536\n01:20:30.600 --> 01:20:32.020\nAnd I just didn't give it enough time,\nright.\n\n1537\n01:20:32.020 --> 01:20:34.820\nSo had I left it with enough time,\nit would have finished that out and\n\n1538\n01:20:34.820 --> 01:20:36.640\nbacked it up, right.\n\n1539\n01:20:36.640 --> 01:20:40.098\nNow instead of backing up to a drive,\nI could have backed up to an image file.\n\n1540\n01:20:40.098 --> 01:20:44.032\nJust something that I kept for\nmy own purposes.\n\n1541\n01:20:44.032 --> 01:20:51.324\nSo what I could have done this\nsaid dd improfile /dev/sdb1 and\n\n1542\n01:20:51.324 --> 01:20:57.671\nfor the output I could have\nspecifined something like,\n\n1543\n01:20:57.671 --> 01:21:03.250\nlet's say, my home directory/ videos.img.\n\n1544\n01:21:03.250 --> 01:21:07.190\nSo I'm gonna back up that\ndrive to an image file.\n\n1545\n01:21:07.190 --> 01:21:09.640\nNow .img I just made that up.\n\n1546\n01:21:09.640 --> 01:21:11.280\nI could call it whatever I wanted.\n\n1547\n01:21:11.280 --> 01:21:12.370\nDrive, whatever.\n\n1548\n01:21:12.370 --> 01:21:14.640\nSo I'm just calling it videos.img.\n\n1549\n01:21:14.640 --> 01:21:17.470\nNow instead of cloning\nit to another drive,\n\n1550\n01:21:17.470 --> 01:21:19.230\nit's gonna clone it to an image file.\n\n1551\n01:21:19.230 --> 01:21:23.158\nAnd it's gonna park it right there,\nand off it goes, right.\n\n1552\n01:21:23.158 --> 01:21:25.784\nNow the reason I wanted to do it this way,\n\n1553\n01:21:25.784 --> 01:21:28.891\nis that I can jump over\nto one of my other TTY's.\n\n1554\n01:21:32.358 --> 01:21:35.779\nAnd in here I can see Videos.img and\n\n1555\n01:21:35.779 --> 01:21:41.253\nright now Videos.img is three\ngigs in size already, and\n\n1556\n01:21:41.253 --> 01:21:47.313\nI can sit here and I can use ls-\nlah let me shrink that down a bit.\n\n1557\n01:21:49.983 --> 01:21:51.135\nThere.\n\n1558\n01:21:51.135 --> 01:21:53.455\nAnd I can kinda watch the progress, right.\n\n1559\n01:21:53.455 --> 01:21:55.055\nSo 5.4 gigabytes right now.\n\n1560\n01:21:55.055 --> 01:21:56.975\nIt's already moving\nfaster than the last one.\n\n1561\n01:21:56.975 --> 01:21:58.275\nI don't know why it was going so slow.\n\n1562\n01:21:58.275 --> 01:22:01.510\nI guess cuz I'm reading and\nwriting on the same bus or whatever,\n\n1563\n01:22:01.510 --> 01:22:03.550\nthat it was slowing it down.\n\n1564\n01:22:03.550 --> 01:22:06.060\nBut so I'm already at 7.6 gigs.\n\n1565\n01:22:06.060 --> 01:22:07.830\nSo here it is backing it up.\n\n1566\n01:22:07.830 --> 01:22:10.710\nAnd when it's done,\nI'm gonna have an img file.\n\n1567\n01:22:10.710 --> 01:22:12.840\nThere's gonna be 36 gigs in size.\n\n1568\n01:22:12.840 --> 01:22:16.120\nCuz it's containing all that empty space.\n\n1569\n01:22:16.120 --> 01:22:17.880\nNow I can filter it through gzip.\n\n1570\n01:22:17.880 --> 01:22:20.600\nIf I want, and when I do that\nit will compress it way down,\n\n1571\n01:22:20.600 --> 01:22:22.210\ncuz all that space is empty.\n\n1572\n01:22:22.210 --> 01:22:24.870\nSo I can make it a lot smaller,\nafter the backup is done.\n\n1573\n01:22:24.870 --> 01:22:27.510\nBut it's churning along, and\nit's backing it up to an image file.\n\n1574\n01:22:28.640 --> 01:22:34.980\nNow once it's backed up, if I want\nto restore it, all I have to do is\n\n1575\n01:22:34.980 --> 01:22:40.650\nreverse, shoot where's the, I'm in a\ndifferent TTY, I'm looking for my history.\n\n1576\n01:22:40.650 --> 01:22:42.610\nAll I need to do is reverse the command,\nright.\n\n1577\n01:22:42.610 --> 01:22:48.374\nSo I would say input file\n=/root/ Videos.img and\n\n1578\n01:22:48.374 --> 01:22:52.330\nthen output file= /deb/sdb1.\n\n1579\n01:22:52.330 --> 01:22:55.200\nAnd that'll restore\nthe image to the hard drive.\n\n1580\n01:22:55.200 --> 01:22:57.480\nIt'll put it back and there it goes.\n\n1581\n01:22:57.480 --> 01:23:00.090\nAnd this is a bit for bit back up, so\n\n1582\n01:23:00.090 --> 01:23:02.780\nI don't even care if\nthe partition has been formatted.\n\n1583\n01:23:02.780 --> 01:23:06.190\nIt'll put this back exactly the way it was\n\n1584\n01:23:06.190 --> 01:23:08.225\nwhen I took that disk image,\nwhen I did dd.\n\n1585\n01:23:08.225 --> 01:23:12.770\n>> Mm-hm, all right so Don,\nso you're taking over sdb1.\n\n1586\n01:23:12.770 --> 01:23:15.820\nLet's say you had multiple\npartitions under this drive.\n\n1587\n01:23:15.820 --> 01:23:21.130\nCould you specify sdb and\nthen just grab the entire physical disk?\n\n1588\n01:23:21.130 --> 01:23:22.790\nPlus all of its partitions?\n\n1589\n01:23:22.790 --> 01:23:23.730\n>> That is a great question.\n\n1590\n01:23:23.730 --> 01:23:24.610\nI do not think so.\n\n1591\n01:23:24.610 --> 01:23:25.610\n>> All right.\n\n1592\n01:23:25.610 --> 01:23:28.590\n>> I've never tried it,\nto be honest with you.\n\n1593\n01:23:28.590 --> 01:23:32.390\nWell let's see,\nthe man page is pretty cryptic.\n\n1594\n01:23:32.390 --> 01:23:35.200\nI don't think you can.\n\n1595\n01:23:35.200 --> 01:23:37.440\nIf this other one wasn't still running,\nI'd give it a shot and\n\n1596\n01:23:37.440 --> 01:23:39.440\nwe'd answer that question in practice.\n\n1597\n01:23:39.440 --> 01:23:40.720\nI guess I could try.\n\n1598\n01:23:40.720 --> 01:23:42.110\n>> Cuz it. [CROSSTALK] >> Let me try.\n\n1599\n01:23:42.110 --> 01:23:45.530\n>> sda1 or sda,\ndoes that have two partitions on it?\n\n1600\n01:23:45.530 --> 01:23:47.050\nLike you're swapping your boot?\n\n1601\n01:23:47.050 --> 01:23:48.730\n>> Yeah, I don't wanna.\n\n1602\n01:23:48.730 --> 01:23:50.160\nLet's just try and specify the.\n\n1603\n01:23:50.160 --> 01:23:50.875\nWe'll give it a shot.\n\n1604\n01:23:50.875 --> 01:23:51.750\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Right Worst case scenario\n\n1605\n01:23:51.750 --> 01:23:52.335\nwe'll break something.\n\n1606\n01:23:52.335 --> 01:23:52.860\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n1607\n01:23:52.860 --> 01:23:54.550\nI'll say,\n>> And so\n\n1608\n01:23:54.550 --> 01:23:56.880\nI'm just gonna specify sdb all together.\n\n1609\n01:23:58.070 --> 01:24:07.700\nAnd then I will specify my\noutput file as /root/test.img.\n\n1610\n01:24:07.700 --> 01:24:10.420\nSo we'll give that a shot and\nyeah it failed, all right, so.\n\n1611\n01:24:10.420 --> 01:24:13.572\nYeah, so it doesn't look like we can.\n\n1612\n01:24:13.572 --> 01:24:15.920\nAlthough, ooh actually,\nI just thought of something else.\n\n1613\n01:24:15.920 --> 01:24:17.485\nI probably am really out of space.\n\n1614\n01:24:17.485 --> 01:24:20.600\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> My root folder is on a petition that's\n\n1615\n01:24:20.600 --> 01:24:22.180\nonly 20 gigs in size.\n\n1616\n01:24:22.180 --> 01:24:24.680\nAnd so it's smaller than\nthe drive I'm backing up, so\n\n1617\n01:24:24.680 --> 01:24:26.190\nI bet I did just run out of space.\n\n1618\n01:24:26.190 --> 01:24:28.330\nLet me jump back over to my other TTY.\n\n1619\n01:24:28.330 --> 01:24:32.078\nYeah, I ran out of space shoot.\n\n1620\n01:24:32.078 --> 01:24:34.970\nSo [LAUGH] that's fun.\n\n1621\n01:24:34.970 --> 01:24:36.445\nSo let me get rid of that giant file.\n\n1622\n01:24:36.445 --> 01:24:38.340\nWell what I'll leave the file there.\n\n1623\n01:24:38.340 --> 01:24:43.320\nAll right, so I've got that\nvideos.img file right here, and\n\n1624\n01:24:43.320 --> 01:24:46.850\nI can see that it backed it up and\nthat it is pretty big now,\n\n1625\n01:24:46.850 --> 01:24:49.310\nit back up until it\nfilled up my hard drive.\n\n1626\n01:24:49.310 --> 01:24:51.760\nSo it's sitting at 15 gigs\nno because I had other data,\n\n1627\n01:24:51.760 --> 01:24:54.920\nif I do it df-h I'll see\nthat I'm out of space.\n\n1628\n01:24:56.390 --> 01:24:58.900\nYeah, I'm at 100% used on my root folder.\n\n1629\n01:24:58.900 --> 01:25:03.710\nSo I can expand my drive like we saw\nbefore, but remember that since we're\n\n1630\n01:25:03.710 --> 01:25:07.020\ndoing a bit for bit backup,\nit's gonna be a pretty large file.\n\n1631\n01:25:07.020 --> 01:25:10.460\nNow a lot of that file is empty, but\nwe could probably compress it down.\n\n1632\n01:25:10.460 --> 01:25:11.880\nBut since I'm completely out of space,\n\n1633\n01:25:11.880 --> 01:25:14.042\nI don't really have anywhere know where\nto put the compressed version of it.\n\n1634\n01:25:14.042 --> 01:25:16.549\n[LAUGH] I guess I can\nput it back into videos.\n\n1635\n01:25:16.549 --> 01:25:19.190\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That would be weird.\n\n1636\n01:25:19.190 --> 01:25:22.210\nCouple other things to point out here,\nthough dd is pretty easy.\n\n1637\n01:25:22.210 --> 01:25:24.870\nRight.\nYou've got your input and your output and\n\n1638\n01:25:24.870 --> 01:25:29.550\nyou use those and doing a backup, your\ninput is to the drive you wanna backup and\n\n1639\n01:25:29.550 --> 01:25:31.060\nthe output is the destination.\n\n1640\n01:25:31.060 --> 01:25:34.550\nTo do a restore,\nthe input is the backup, and\n\n1641\n01:25:34.550 --> 01:25:37.610\nthe output is where you want\nto restore it to, all right.\n\n1642\n01:25:37.610 --> 01:25:39.120\nWhen you have an image file like this,\n\n1643\n01:25:39.120 --> 01:25:41.240\nyou can actually mount\nthe image file if you want.\n\n1644\n01:25:41.240 --> 01:25:44.360\nIf you wanna look inside of\nthe image file and see what's there.\n\n1645\n01:25:44.360 --> 01:25:45.650\nYou can do that.\n\n1646\n01:25:47.470 --> 01:25:51.789\nSo for example,\nI could unmount [SOUND] the videos\n\n1647\n01:25:51.789 --> 01:25:55.379\nfolder from the drive, and, shoot.\n\n1648\n01:25:55.379 --> 01:25:57.398\nLet me, I'm just a little bit of space.\n\n1649\n01:25:57.398 --> 01:26:03.200\nSo let me get rid of that.\n\n1650\n01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:06.398\n[SOUND] There I just need to\nfree up a little bit of space.\n\n1651\n01:26:06.398 --> 01:26:09.320\nI'm gonna unmount the videos folder.\n\n1652\n01:26:10.510 --> 01:26:16.230\nThe videos folder was\nmounted to /dov/ SDB1, right.\n\n1653\n01:26:16.230 --> 01:26:20.500\nSo I just unmounted it and now what\nI could do is I could mount the image\n\n1654\n01:26:20.500 --> 01:26:24.050\nto that folder and now I could\nsee inside of the backup, right.\n\n1655\n01:26:24.050 --> 01:26:26.190\nOr I guess I could of\nmounted it as videos two or\n\n1656\n01:26:26.190 --> 01:26:28.890\nsomething to see inside of the image.\n\n1657\n01:26:28.890 --> 01:26:29.778\nSo if I want to put this back.\n\n1658\n01:26:34.288 --> 01:26:36.296\nSo it's mounted back to videos and\n\n1659\n01:26:36.296 --> 01:26:39.790\nif I go inside of videos\nthere's the live partition.\n\n1660\n01:26:39.790 --> 01:26:44.100\nAnd I'm gonna make a directory Videos2,\nall right.\n\n1661\n01:26:44.100 --> 01:26:47.610\nAnd what we can do is we can just do\na mount, and we can mount the image.\n\n1662\n01:26:47.610 --> 01:26:52.070\nNow mounting the image is a little\nweird because it's not on a real drive.\n\n1663\n01:26:52.070 --> 01:26:56.570\nSo we do have to specify some options,\nlike the loop option, which basically says\n\n1664\n01:26:56.570 --> 01:26:59.860\nto scan across the entire file to\nfind the beginning and the end.\n\n1665\n01:26:59.860 --> 01:27:04.111\nSo I'll say, loop and\nI'm gonna mount it, so\n\n1666\n01:27:04.111 --> 01:27:07.503\nI'll say what did I call that thing?\n\n1667\n01:27:07.503 --> 01:27:09.663\nVideos.img?\n\n1668\n01:27:09.663 --> 01:27:10.458\n>> Yeah, I think so.\n\n1669\n01:27:10.458 --> 01:27:12.230\n>> Guess we'll find out.\nI don't think it's gonna mount anyway\n\n1670\n01:27:12.230 --> 01:27:16.285\ncuz it's incomplete, so it's gonna get\nsome errors, but we'll give it a shot.\n\n1671\n01:27:16.285 --> 01:27:17.980\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1672\n01:27:17.980 --> 01:27:24.340\n>> So I'm gonna mount that,\nthat image to /root/Videos2, okay.\n\n1673\n01:27:24.340 --> 01:27:27.130\nI'm going to mount it there, so\nthat I can go and look at it.\n\n1674\n01:27:27.130 --> 01:27:30.150\nIf I go into Videos,\nI'll see the live Videos folder.\n\n1675\n01:27:30.150 --> 01:27:34.250\nIf I go into Videos2, I'll see the backup.\n\n1676\n01:27:34.250 --> 01:27:35.530\nAnd wrong file system types.\n\n1677\n01:27:35.530 --> 01:27:41.418\nSo it's corrupt cuz it's only half\nthe image and so I can't get into it.\n\n1678\n01:27:41.418 --> 01:27:45.668\nBut if I were to mount it, we'd be able\nto get right in there and grab it.\n\n1679\n01:27:45.668 --> 01:27:47.959\nSo I don't have enough disk space,\nso I can't do it.\n\n1680\n01:27:47.959 --> 01:27:49.168\nBut the DD command.\n\n1681\n01:27:49.168 --> 01:27:50.960\nExtremely simple to use.\n\n1682\n01:27:50.960 --> 01:27:54.219\nMounting the image, you just have\nto remember to do that -o loop.\n\n1683\n01:27:54.219 --> 01:27:55.799\nIf you don't do that, it gets ticked off.\n\n1684\n01:27:55.799 --> 01:27:59.984\nSo actually,\nlet's see what happens if I don't do it.\n\n1685\n01:27:59.984 --> 01:28:01.858\nIt's just probably not gonna work\nanyway just cuz of the corruption.\n\n1686\n01:28:04.059 --> 01:28:05.539\nOr yeah, is not a blocked device.\n\n1687\n01:28:05.539 --> 01:28:10.476\nSo it's telling us it's not a disk, and\nthat we might wanna try -o loop, so\n\n1688\n01:28:10.476 --> 01:28:11.568\nlike loopback.\n\n1689\n01:28:11.568 --> 01:28:13.520\nSo pretty straightforward there.\n\n1690\n01:28:13.520 --> 01:28:14.888\nThe dd command, very powerful.\n\n1691\n01:28:14.888 --> 01:28:16.829\nIt does make big files though.\n\n1692\n01:28:16.829 --> 01:28:21.290\nAnd when you're done, you can zip them up,\nand they do become considerably smaller.\n\n1693\n01:28:21.290 --> 01:28:22.784\nAnd like I said,\nI don't have enough room to do it.\n\n1694\n01:28:22.784 --> 01:28:24.304\nWell, let me just try this.\n\n1695\n01:28:24.304 --> 01:28:29.269\nI'll do gzip ./Videos.img to I'll stick\n\n1696\n01:28:29.269 --> 01:28:34.103\nit inside of that other\ndisk cuz it has room,\n\n1697\n01:28:34.103 --> 01:28:37.119\nif I can spell it, videos.\n\n1698\n01:28:37.119 --> 01:28:38.359\nThere we go.\n\n1699\n01:28:38.359 --> 01:28:41.299\nBackup.tgz.\n\n1700\n01:28:41.299 --> 01:28:42.039\nThere we go.\n\n1701\n01:28:42.039 --> 01:28:45.021\nSo that file is sitting\nat about 15 gigs in size,\n\n1702\n01:28:45.021 --> 01:28:48.648\nand it's doing the temporary\nfile right here, shoot.\n\n1703\n01:28:48.648 --> 01:28:51.029\nThat's not gonna work.\n\n1704\n01:28:51.029 --> 01:28:54.989\nI don't know if there's a way\nI can get around that either.\n\n1705\n01:28:54.989 --> 01:28:55.729\nWe'll experiment.\n\n1706\n01:29:02.001 --> 01:29:05.409\nI knew I should have made a bigger disk\non that system, and yeah, I didn't.\n\n1707\n01:29:05.409 --> 01:29:07.460\nAll right, well, no big deal there.\n\n1708\n01:29:07.460 --> 01:29:10.728\nSo just remember the dd command\nreally straightforward syntax.\n\n1709\n01:29:10.728 --> 01:29:15.322\nDd input in whatever, and\nthen output is whatever, and\n\n1710\n01:29:15.322 --> 01:29:19.639\nthat output can be another disk,\nor it can be a file.\n\n1711\n01:29:19.639 --> 01:29:23.778\nThe input can be another disk or a file,\nvery easy to duplicate stuff right there.\n\n1712\n01:29:23.778 --> 01:29:27.351\nAnd then if you mount the image,\nyou've got to use -o loop, or\n\n1713\n01:29:27.351 --> 01:29:28.638\nit's not gonna work.\n\n1714\n01:29:28.638 --> 01:29:32.994\nIf you're mounting the disk, you use mount\nlike normal, and so you can mount it,\n\n1715\n01:29:32.994 --> 01:29:34.399\ngive it a go and off you go.\n\n1716\n01:29:34.399 --> 01:29:35.099\n>> Nice.\n\n1717\n01:29:35.099 --> 01:29:36.487\n>> All right, so that's quick and\n\n1718\n01:29:36.487 --> 01:29:39.788\neasy backup without relying on any\nthird party software that we installed.\n\n1719\n01:29:39.788 --> 01:29:43.409\nDd, it's built into\nthe system we need to know.\n\n1720\n01:29:43.409 --> 01:29:46.639\nI think that's about it,\nlet me check my notes, yeah.\n\n1721\n01:29:46.639 --> 01:29:47.258\nIt's about it.\n\n1722\n01:29:47.258 --> 01:29:48.441\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> You think anything else we\n\n1723\n01:29:48.441 --> 01:29:49.019\nshould throw in?\n\n1724\n01:29:49.019 --> 01:29:49.999\n>> Yeah, no.\n\n1725\n01:29:49.999 --> 01:29:50.919\nI think we're good for now.\n\n1726\n01:29:50.919 --> 01:29:51.819\n>> All

evening and welcome back.\n\n4\n00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:38.520\nTo another episode of ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.630\nI'm your host Don Pezet,\nback again with Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n6\n00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:42.410\nHow's it going, Ronnie?\n\n7\n00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:44.180\n>> It is going swell this morning.\n\n8\n00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:45.170\nI am doing great.\n\n9\n00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.090\nI have actually not looked at the news\nthis morning, so I'm pretty much happy.\n\n10\n00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.095\n>> Well I know you haven't looked at\nthe news cuz you missed the memo.\n\n11\n00:00:52.095 --> 00:00:52.605\n>> I did.\n\n12\n00:00:52.605 --> 00:00:54.125\n>> It's Hawaiian shirt Friday, Ronnie.\n\n13\n00:00:54.125 --> 00:00:55.005\n>> Yes, I saw.\n\n14\n00:00:55.005 --> 00:00:58.185\nYeah, all you need is the mustache and\nyou'd look like Magnum P.I.\n\n15\n00:00:58.185 --> 00:00:58.695\n>> That's right.\n\n16\n00:00:58.695 --> 00:01:01.955\nActually, we got to hurry up on this\nepisode cuz TC is gonna be picking me up\n\n17\n00:01:01.955 --> 00:01:03.925\nin the chopper and\nwe're going back to the robin's nest.\n\n18\n00:01:03.925 --> 00:01:04.548\n>> Yeah.\nSo [LAUGH].\n\n19\n00:01:04.548 --> 00:01:05.620\n>> [LAUGH] Island hopper.\n\n20\n00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:06.827\nThat's right, nice!\n\n21\n00:01:06.827 --> 00:01:13.150\n>> So anyhow, we're back for another\nepisode, a festive island theme episode.\n\n22\n00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:14.450\n>> Nice.\n>> Of Linux+.\n\n23\n00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.850\nAnd we're gonna be talking about\nour file system structure.\n\n24\n00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.140\nHow the file system is organized and\nall that good stuff.\n\n25\n00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:21.560\nSo we'll get a chance to see it,\n\n26\n00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.010\nand some things I know we've lightly\ntouched on in other episodes but\n\n27\n00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.930\nthis will be our chance to really dive\nin there and get a chance to see it.\n\n28\n00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.410\nYeah, so without further adieu\nlet's just jump right in.\n\n29\n00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.870\nWe've been navigating around\nour hard drive a good bit and\n\n30\n00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:39.320\nwe've spent most of our\ntime in our home directory.\n\n31\n00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.970\nAnd we've looked a little bit at /etc,\n\n32\n00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.680\nthat other directory just to kind\nof see what was going on there.\n\n33\n00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.360\nWell most Linux distributions\nfollow a certain hierarchy,\n\n34\n00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.480\na way of organizing the folders.\n\n35\n00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:57.020\nIn the early days of Linux, remember\nLinux itself really is just the kernel.\n\n36\n00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.290\nAll the other stuff around it is created\nby the distributions and [INAUDIBLE] and\n\n37\n00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.240\nall that.\n\n38\n00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:07.180\nSo there's a lot of flexibility in where\nthey choose to put things, and when\n\n39\n00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:12.020\nyou jump between unix like OS's, you'll\nfind things are in different places.\n\n40\n00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.690\nTake OSX for example.\n\n41\n00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.660\nMac OSX is running on top of BSD.\n\n42\n00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.570\nInstead of storing user profiles\nin the normal location /home,\n\n43\n00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:24.510\nthey choose to put it in /users.\n\n44\n00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.680\nYou can do that, distros can choose\nto put stuff wherever they want.\n\n45\n00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.040\nIt just makes it confusing as hell when\nyou try to jump between distributions.\n\n46\n00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:37.620\nMost of the distributions out there have\nagreed on a standard arrangement for\n\n47\n00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.390\nwhat you are gonna find as far as a folder\nstructure on your system All right.\n\n48\n00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.920\nI was gonna make a diagram, but the guys\nover at The Geek Stuff made a really good\n\n49\n00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.270\ndiagram for this stuff, so I'm just\ngonna kind of link to their's, and\n\n50\n00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:53.150\nI'll put this URL in our show notes,\nso you can find it.\n\n51\n00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.730\nBasically they just broke it down by\n\n52\n00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.800\nthe URLs that you're pretty\nmuch guaranteed to see.\n\n53\n00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.610\nOr not URLs, the folder structure that\nyou're pretty much guaranteed to see.\n\n54\n00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:06.330\nNow some of these are optional, we don't\nactually have to have all of these.\n\n55\n00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:11.270\nBut this is typically what we're gonna\nsee on a Linux-based system, all right.\n\n56\n00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:14.270\nWe have been looking in /home.\n\n57\n00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:16.455\nAnd that's where your user\nhome directories are.\n\n58\n00:03:16.455 --> 00:03:19.572\nSo that's where my\npersonal files would go.\n\n59\n00:03:19.572 --> 00:03:23.720\nThere's also /ruth which I don't\nthink they've put on there.\n\n60\n00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:24.390\nYeah.\n\n61\n00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.000\nThe root user has their own directory and\nit's outside of /home.\n\n62\n00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.990\nSo every user account we create\nwill get a folder inside of /home,\n\n63\n00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:35.510\nbut root that user gets\na folder that's just /root.\n\n64\n00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:39.010\nIt's not actually in the home folder,\nall right.\n\n65\n00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.510\n/etc is another big one, that's where\nall of our configuration files are, and\n\n66\n00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.480\netc is just sort for etchetera.\n\n67\n00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:50.680\nAll the various configurations in system\nfiles, or whatever, right in there.\n\n68\n00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.960\nIt's mostly just a giant collection of\ntext files, and so when you look in there,\n\n69\n00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:56.990\nthat's really what you see.\n\n70\n00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:59.730\nSome of the other ones that we see,\nwe've got binary files,\n\n71\n00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:01.830\nthese are the programs that we run.\n\n72\n00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:04.644\nAnd you'll see there's /bin and /sbin.\n\n73\n00:04:04.644 --> 00:04:07.970\n/sbin, those are the binaries\nthat the system uses,\n\n74\n00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:10.090\nthat Linux itself is making use of.\n\n75\n00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:13.390\nAnd /bin, those are user binaries\nones that we use as regular users.\n\n76\n00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:19.277\nYou'll also see inside of /usr that\nthere'll be a /bin and a /sbin.\n\n77\n00:04:19.277 --> 00:04:21.810\nNotice this /usr, that's User Programs.\n\n78\n00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:25.920\nThose are the programs that we\ninstall ourselves, usually later on.\n\n79\n00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:30.610\nAnd so inside of /usr, it'll be /bin and\n/sbin for those programs.\n\n80\n00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:36.380\nSo you kind of have really four places\nthat a program could be on your system.\n\n81\n00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:40.690\nAnd that does get confusing, we'll see a\nway to fill that out later on, all right.\n\n82\n00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:43.310\nSome of the other things /dev we've used,\nright.\n\n83\n00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:45.200\nThat was where our hardware devices were.\n\n84\n00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:46.600\nWe did it a lot with hard drives.\n\n85\n00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.400\nAnd in yesterday's episode, /dev/SDA1.\n\n86\n00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:50.140\nRight.\n\n87\n00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:53.555\nFor hard drive A or\nhard drive one petition one.\n\n88\n00:04:53.555 --> 00:04:56.920\n/proc, that's where our\nprocess information goes.\n\n89\n00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:59.410\nWhen we do PSAUX, right.\n\n90\n00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:03.280\nAnd we list all of our processes, it's\nreally looking into that proc folder and\n\n91\n00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.800\nlooking for pID files, process ID files.\n\n92\n00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:09.070\nAnd every time a program runs, it's\nsupposed to register a pID file in there,\n\n93\n00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:13.840\nso that's what's in the prog folder,\n/bar, right.\n\n94\n00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:16.140\nThis is where we have our variable files.\n\n95\n00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:19.410\nYou'll hear variable or various,\npeople have different names for it, and\n\n96\n00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:21.360\nI don't mean variables like\nprogramming variables.\n\n97\n00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:26.010\nI just mean that, when you have two\nservers that are running CentOS 6.5 for\n\n98\n00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:28.310\nthe most part they're identical, right.\n\n99\n00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:31.150\nThey have the same set of files,\nthey're both running the same OS.\n\n100\n00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:32.710\nWhat is it that makes them unique?\n\n101\n00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:36.114\nThe things that make them unique\nare typically in /var, right.\n\n102\n00:05:36.114 --> 00:05:39.530\n/home may also be unique,\nbut /var definitely.\n\n103\n00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:41.170\nSo if I'm running a web server,\n\n104\n00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:44.480\nall of my website files will\ntypically go in /var/ www.\n\n105\n00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:45.210\nIf we're running Apache.\n\n106\n00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:50.150\nIf you're running a different web browser,\nit might go somewhere else.\n\n107\n00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:54.640\nSo you might have five web servers,\nwhich are all basically identical, but\n\n108\n00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:59.515\nthen the web pages they host\nare different Inside a slash bar.\n\n109\n00:05:59.515 --> 00:06:01.735\n/tmp, that's temporary files, right.\n\n110\n00:06:01.735 --> 00:06:03.815\nJust things that we're not going\nto be using for very long.\n\n111\n00:06:03.815 --> 00:06:07.355\nMaybe it's some kind of temporary\nmemory storage for a program and\n\n112\n00:06:07.355 --> 00:06:08.805\nthen it gets wiped out\nwhen the program is gone.\n\n113\n00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:12.975\n/usr I already talked about and /home.\n\n114\n00:06:12.975 --> 00:06:16.080\n/boot, we're gonna look at that\none a little more today, but\n\n115\n00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:17.460\nthat's where our boot files go.\n\n116\n00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:20.990\nIt's usually a very small\npartition created on our drive and\n\n117\n00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:23.340\nthen mounted to the /boot folder.\n\n118\n00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:29.770\nSo that's where you'll have things\nlike your vm, linuz, LINUZ file.\n\n119\n00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:34.020\nAnd that's where you can find out how to\nactually boot the bootloader for Linux.\n\n120\n00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:37.100\nIf you're running Grub, the boot manager,\nit goes in there too, or\n\n121\n00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:38.110\nat least it's config files do.\n\n122\n00:06:39.585 --> 00:06:42.450\n/lib is where our library files go.\n\n123\n00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:44.900\nNow what are libraries?\n\n124\n00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:47.140\nThere's a lot of things that programs do.\n\n125\n00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:49.220\nThat are duplicates, right.\n\n126\n00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:54.120\nTake for example, if I have, I don't know\n\n127\n00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:59.290\nGoogle Chrome and Mozilla Firefox,\nthey're both web browsers.\n\n128\n00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:01.490\nAnd if I go to their file menu.\n\n129\n00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:05.750\nUnder their file menu, they both have a\nclose option, to close the program, right.\n\n130\n00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:08.510\nWell the guys at Google\ncould have written that and\n\n131\n00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:10.280\nthe guys at Mozilla\ncould have written that.\n\n132\n00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:13.420\nThey both could have written\nthat same functionality.\n\n133\n00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:16.590\nBut why reinvent the wheel for\nsomething so simple like that.\n\n134\n00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:22.160\nSo simple common activities will\nget written into library files and\n\n135\n00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:25.520\nthe library files can be shared\nacross any program on your system.\n\n136\n00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:29.460\nSo when the guys at Google wanted to add\nfile and close to Chrome, they didn't have\n\n137\n00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:33.160\nto write that from scratch, they just\nhad to call a library that did it.\n\n138\n00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:36.591\nAnd if you're running x windows then\nyou've got a graphical user interface and\n\n139\n00:07:36.591 --> 00:07:38.278\nyou want to draw a button on the screen,\n\n140\n00:07:38.278 --> 00:07:40.293\nyou're not the first\nperson to draw a button.\n\n141\n00:07:40.293 --> 00:07:44.295\nSo you can just call one of the graphic\nlibraries like GTK or whatever.\n\n142\n00:07:44.295 --> 00:07:45.655\nAnd you can pull from there and\n\n143\n00:07:45.655 --> 00:07:48.168\npull the button rendering\nroutines right out of that.\n\n144\n00:07:48.168 --> 00:07:49.708\nAll right?\n\n145\n00:07:49.708 --> 00:07:52.460\nIn the old days we didn't\nhave shared libraries.\n\n146\n00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:55.259\nAnd so every program either\nhad to reinvent the wheel, or\n\n147\n00:07:55.259 --> 00:07:59.240\nhave duplicate copies of library files\nthat other programs were already using.\n\n148\n00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:02.100\nYou might have the same library\nfile on there 15 times,\n\n149\n00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:03.925\nbecause 15 programs needed it.\n\n150\n00:08:03.925 --> 00:08:04.905\n>> Waste of space.\n\n151\n00:08:04.905 --> 00:08:06.905\n>> Yeah, a big waste of space.\n\n152\n00:08:06.905 --> 00:08:10.155\nIn the Windows world they called\nit DLL hell [LAUGH] because in\n\n153\n00:08:10.155 --> 00:08:12.055\nWindows they were dynamic link libraries.\n\n154\n00:08:12.055 --> 00:08:14.615\nIn LINUX they don't call\nthem dynamic link libraries,\n\n155\n00:08:14.615 --> 00:08:16.475\nbut that is effectively what they are.\n\n156\n00:08:16.475 --> 00:08:18.460\nWe dynamically link them\nin their libraries.\n\n157\n00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:21.668\nBut we'll see them later,\nwe usually call them SO's.\n\n158\n00:08:21.668 --> 00:08:22.925\n>> Shared.\n\n159\n00:08:22.925 --> 00:08:26.200\n>> Shared objects, yeah.\n\n160\n00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:30.720\nWe've also got /opt,\nwhich is optional add on apps.\n\n161\n00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:32.610\nNow, I don't use this one a lot.\n\n162\n00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:35.320\nBack in the Solaris days I used it\na ton because it was where it liked to\n\n163\n00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:36.540\ninstall programs.\n\n164\n00:08:36.540 --> 00:08:39.110\nBut again, it's kind of like /usr,\n\n165\n00:08:39.110 --> 00:08:43.501\nprograms we install might choose\nto install into /opt instead.\n\n166\n00:08:43.501 --> 00:08:45.190\n/mnt, that's our mount directory.\n\n167\n00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:47.742\nNow I mounted a hard drive\nin yesterday's episode.\n\n168\n00:08:47.742 --> 00:08:49.060\nI mounted it right in my home directory.\n\n169\n00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:51.215\nYou can mount wherever you want, but\n\n170\n00:08:51.215 --> 00:08:55.560\n/mnt is kind of designed to be\nthe default place that you mount things.\n\n171\n00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:57.380\nSo if you are looking for\nexternal hard drive or\n\n172\n00:08:57.380 --> 00:08:59.410\nCD drives,\nthat's normally the first place you check.\n\n173\n00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:04.957\nThat's changed over recent years though\ncuz you're seeing a lot distros now using\n\n174\n00:09:04.957 --> 00:09:05.520\n/media.\n\n175\n00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:08.401\nIf they mount a CD ROM drive or\nUSB, those are removable,\n\n176\n00:09:08.401 --> 00:09:12.220\nthey might not always be there and\nso they may mount them to /media.\n\n177\n00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:13.360\nNot every distro does that.\n\n178\n00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:17.000\nYou see them kind of vary between the two.\n\n179\n00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.780\n/srv, that's service data.\n\n180\n00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:24.620\nIf you have a service running like MySQL\nor Apache, it's got to store information\n\n181\n00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:28.060\nabout the running service, and\nit may choose to pop it into /srv.\n\n182\n00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:29.710\nNow i'll tell you many\nprograms don't do that.\n\n183\n00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:34.110\nMany still log that into /var or\nother places /tmp.\n\n184\n00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:37.840\nSo, just because the folder is there\ndoesn't necessarily mean it's being used\n\n185\n00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:42.180\nin the way you think, and that's because\nwith Linux we have a lot of flexibility,\n\n186\n00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:44.840\na lot of functionality\nto choose what we want.\n\n187\n00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:47.770\nNow, if all of the distros follow\nthis hierarchy right here,\n\n188\n00:09:47.770 --> 00:09:49.510\nwe'd be in great shape, wouldn't we?\n\n189\n00:09:49.510 --> 00:09:51.850\nBut they don't, you know,\nthere are little variations between them.\n\n190\n00:09:51.850 --> 00:09:57.410\nSo don't expect to see all of these\nfolders on every distro you work with.\n\n191\n00:09:57.410 --> 00:10:01.080\nAll right, now there are some\norganizations, like Red Hat, that have\n\n192\n00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:05.480\nreally been striving to fix this, to get\neverybody to adopt the same pattern.\n\n193\n00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:08.740\nAnd Red Hat, they're a powerful player\nin the Linux community cuz they\n\n194\n00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:10.750\ngenerate more revenue than anybody else.\n\n195\n00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:16.960\nAnd so they released what's called the FHS\nand you might see this on the exam.\n\n196\n00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:20.530\nIt's the Filesystem Hierarchy Standards\nand\n\n197\n00:10:20.530 --> 00:10:23.300\nI'll post the URL to this\nin the show notes also.\n\n198\n00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:24.350\nBut basically,\n\n199\n00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:28.270\nit's where they list how they want you to\norganize your folder structure, right?\n\n200\n00:10:28.270 --> 00:10:31.600\nAnd at the end of the day,\nthey boil it down to two points.\n\n201\n00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:36.490\nHere's the two most important points\nthat they want you to observe.\n\n202\n00:10:36.490 --> 00:10:38.670\nIf you observe these two,\nthat will make them happy.\n\n203\n00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:41.390\nThere's lot more you could observe but\nthese are the minimum, right?\n\n204\n00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:43.248\nThe minimum is first off,\n\n205\n00:10:43.248 --> 00:10:46.870\nplease be compatible-\n>> Right.\n\n206\n00:10:46.870 --> 00:10:50.170\n>> With other FHS systems.\n\n207\n00:10:50.170 --> 00:10:53.360\nIn other words, if you don't wanna\nobserve the standard file structure,\n\n208\n00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:57.310\nthat's fine, but\nallow other systems to do it.\n\n209\n00:10:57.310 --> 00:11:01.300\nSo that if somebody writes a program,\nthey can make it FHS compliant, and\n\n210\n00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:04.232\nthen when you install that\nprogram on your non-FHS system,\n\n211\n00:11:04.232 --> 00:11:07.780\nF-H-S system,\nyou still allow it to work, right?\n\n212\n00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:11.440\nSo if I create like /pgm, and\nthat's where I want my programs to go,\n\n213\n00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:14.780\nwell, that's not what FHS asks for.\n\n214\n00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:19.870\nAnd if I set my system to only allow\nprograms to run from /pgm, and then I\n\n215\n00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:26.140\ninstall a program and it tries to install\nin /sbin or /opt, it's not gonna run.\n\n216\n00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:26.800\nI broke it.\n\n217\n00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:29.020\nI broke compatibility with FHS.\n\n218\n00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:32.870\nSo number one is, they say you can\nfollow whatever pattern you want, but\n\n219\n00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:35.790\nplease leave compatibility for us.\n\n220\n00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:43.400\nAnd two, please mount the /usr\nfolder as read-only, right?\n\n221\n00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:45.520\nThat's where applications are going.\n\n222\n00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:47.560\nPeople should be able to execute that.\n\n223\n00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:51.300\nBut you shouldn't let people write\nto it because then what can they do?\n\n224\n00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:53.030\nThey can put whatever program\nthey want in there and\n\n225\n00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:55.230\nthen they can do all sorts of things and\nwreak all sorts of havoc.\n\n226\n00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:59.420\nSo make /usr read only.\n\n227\n00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:01.670\nThat's the only two\nthings that Red Hat asks.\n\n228\n00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:03.588\nOther than that,\nyou can do whatever you want.\n\n229\n00:12:03.588 --> 00:12:08.385\nBut if you If you want to be truly FHS\ncompliant, first off, you have to be able\n\n230\n00:12:08.385 --> 00:12:13.125\nto say it, and then secondly you'll see\nthis document goes on a good bit, right?\n\n231\n00:12:13.125 --> 00:12:16.605\nIt goes on to explain how to\nlook at your disc right now and\n\n232\n00:12:16.605 --> 00:12:20.988\nhow to organize it in a way that\nmatches up with their recommendations.\n\n233\n00:12:20.988 --> 00:12:26.020\nSo use /boot to store your boot\nmanager and boot configuration.\n\n234\n00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:28.370\nUse /dev for your devices.\n\n235\n00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:33.540\nUse /etc for your config files,\n/lib for your libraries.\n\n236\n00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:37.470\nThis is right from that other webpage\nwe just saw, the geek stuff, right?\n\n237\n00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:38.740\nIt's basically laying it out and\n\n238\n00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:43.890\nsaying, we need it to kinda follow\nthis model, /media, /mount.\n\n239\n00:12:43.890 --> 00:12:48.550\nIf your distribution follows\nthis recommendation right here,\n\n240\n00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:51.550\nthen you are FHS compliant and\nyou're good to go.\n\n241\n00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:56.520\n>> All right, so\ngood document to read through.\n\n242\n00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:59.970\nIt does gives a great explanation of\nwhat each of these folders are used for.\n\n243\n00:12:59.970 --> 00:13:02.720\nIf you want to learn a lot about it,\nthis is a great one to read.\n\n244\n00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:06.650\nIf you just want to skim over it,\nthe diagram here on the geek stuff.\n\n245\n00:13:06.650 --> 00:13:09.752\nThat's a better one just for quick review.\n\n246\n00:13:09.752 --> 00:13:14.660\nAll right, so two good sources there and\nI'll post those URLs.\n\n247\n00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:17.182\nNow, for most of us we don't worry about\nthis too much because we're not making our\n\n248\n00:13:17.182 --> 00:13:18.150\nown distro,right?\n\n249\n00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:22.270\nSo you just install a distro, and you live\nin whatever world it created for you.\n\n250\n00:13:22.270 --> 00:13:28.390\nSo like, on the machine that I've been\nusing this whole time, if I go in and\n\n251\n00:13:28.390 --> 00:13:35.780\ntake a look at my root here, and\nlet me, Kind of hard to read the blue.\n\n252\n00:13:35.780 --> 00:13:37.740\nLet me just take the color out, there.\n\n253\n00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:41.430\nSo, we can see where I've got a lot of\nthose folders that they talked about.\n\n254\n00:13:41.430 --> 00:13:45.680\nI've got /boot, /dev, /etc and so on.\n\n255\n00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:46.660\nWell I'd better.\n\n256\n00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:49.380\nI'm running entos which is\ncompiled off of Red Hat.\n\n257\n00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:54.030\nRight, so I'm running a Red Hat\ncompatible operating system because it is\n\n258\n00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:55.510\neffectively compiled from there.\n\n259\n00:13:55.510 --> 00:13:59.733\nSo it should meet the FHS\nrequirements exactly.\n\n260\n00:13:59.733 --> 00:14:01.648\nBut if i'm running\nsomething else like Debian,\n\n261\n00:14:01.648 --> 00:14:03.628\ndo I still have my Debian\nmachine kicking around?\n\n262\n00:14:03.628 --> 00:14:09.500\nProbably somewhere, well who knows.\n\n263\n00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:12.250\nWell, if I have my Debian machine\nfloating around I could fire that one up\n\n264\n00:14:12.250 --> 00:14:12.876\nand show you.\n\n265\n00:14:12.876 --> 00:14:20.440\nI did a dual boot system here where\nI can pick between Debian and CentOS.\n\n266\n00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:23.982\nLet me fire up a Debian one and\nwe'll see here.\n\n267\n00:14:23.982 --> 00:14:29.107\nI think I did a GUI on it,\nthis might take a minute, no I didn't.\n\n268\n00:14:29.107 --> 00:14:31.120\nLet's see if I can remember the password.\n\n269\n00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:32.210\nThere we go.\n\n270\n00:14:32.210 --> 00:14:36.700\nSo here I am on this Debian system,\nand I can see in here,\n\n271\n00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:40.290\nlet me pipe this through the more command,\nwe've got a little.\n\n272\n00:14:41.435 --> 00:14:45.190\n[LAUGH] you know I did that the other day,\ntoo, I piped the clear command.\n\n273\n00:14:45.190 --> 00:14:46.170\nThere we go.\n\n274\n00:14:46.170 --> 00:14:50.100\nSo I can see in here, as I look down\nthe list, I can see folders that\n\n275\n00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:55.040\ndon't match FHS like /apt, right,\nI don't know what that is.\n\n276\n00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:59.660\nAnd as I look down I got /calendar and\nso on.\n\n277\n00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:04.800\nSo those are folders that aren't compliant\nwith FHS, but if I keep looking.\n\n278\n00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:08.100\nActually, you know what,\nI'm actually inside of /etc,\n\n279\n00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:09.779\nthat's why I'm seeing some odd ones.\n\n280\n00:15:11.470 --> 00:15:13.330\nThis is better, here we go.\n\n281\n00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:18.107\nSo I’ve got /boot, /dev,\n/etc, right, /home.\n\n282\n00:15:18.107 --> 00:15:21.190\nThose are compatible with\nwhat we expect for FHS.\n\n283\n00:15:21.190 --> 00:15:24.230\nThis is not a Red Hat system,\nthis is the Debian.\n\n284\n00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:27.360\nBut, again, everybody's kind of\nagreed on this structure, and\n\n285\n00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:29.498\nit ensures that we have compatibility.\n\n286\n00:15:29.498 --> 00:15:33.080\nSo here's /run, that's not part of FHS.\n\n287\n00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:35.450\nOr, what else stands out?\n\n288\n00:15:36.513 --> 00:15:38.530\nI guess that's about it,\nmost of the rest of it is compliant.\n\n289\n00:15:38.530 --> 00:15:41.252\n/sys, you know,\nthat one's a little different.\n\n290\n00:15:41.252 --> 00:15:44.835\nSo you'll see a few extra ones creep\nup that might not match precisely.\n\n291\n00:15:44.835 --> 00:15:49.543\nBut they guarantee compatibility because\nwe've got /usr and some of the other ones.\n\n292\n00:15:49.543 --> 00:15:52.126\n[INAUDIBLE] All right.\n\n293\n00:15:52.126 --> 00:15:56.000\nAnd you can even see here like\non the permissions for usr.\n\n294\n00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:02.050\nOver here it's owned by root and\nthe root user has write access to it.\n\n295\n00:16:02.050 --> 00:16:05.040\nBut everyone else just has read and\nexecute.\n\n296\n00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:07.210\nAnd I know we haven't talked\nabout permissions yet, so\n\n297\n00:16:07.210 --> 00:16:08.330\nwe'll get into that later.\n\n298\n00:16:08.330 --> 00:16:09.850\nBut it is compliant with FHS.\n\n299\n00:16:15.099 --> 00:16:18.853\nAll right, so\nthat's basically the file kinda structure,\n\n300\n00:16:18.853 --> 00:16:23.050\nhow things are arranged, and\nwhere they're supposed to be.\n\n301\n00:16:23.050 --> 00:16:26.200\nAnd if you know that, you can jump\naround and find things really quickly.\n\n302\n00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:29.180\nBut, what if you're not terribly\nfamiliar with the file system yet?\n\n303\n00:16:29.180 --> 00:16:33.715\nIt can get really frustrating to figure\nout where things are on the hard drive.\n\n304\n00:16:33.715 --> 00:16:39.227\nAnd I showed you guys the find\ncommand in what was it?\n\n305\n00:16:39.227 --> 00:16:39.933\nLast [CROSSTALK].\n\n306\n00:16:39.933 --> 00:16:42.127\nWe took a look at the find command,\nand it's nice, but\n\n307\n00:16:42.127 --> 00:16:43.865\nthere's a problem with the find command.\n\n308\n00:16:43.865 --> 00:16:48.245\nThe main problem is that it's\ngotta do a scan of the drive, and,\n\n309\n00:16:48.245 --> 00:16:52.250\nif you're searching your whole drive,\nit can take awhile, right?\n\n310\n00:16:52.250 --> 00:16:55.590\nSo that's an issue that we\nhave with the find command.\n\n311\n00:16:55.590 --> 00:16:57.860\nFor example, let's do some tests here.\n\n312\n00:16:57.860 --> 00:16:58.360\nDo I?\n\n313\n00:16:59.740 --> 00:17:01.580\nWhat did I do with my Linux Bus machine?\n\n314\n00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:02.080\nThere we go.\n\n315\n00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:06.610\nAll right, so,\nlet's say that the ls command.\n\n316\n00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:10.910\nWhere is it stored on the hard drive,\nokay?\n\n317\n00:17:10.910 --> 00:17:11.740\nWell, I don't know.\n\n318\n00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:14.890\nSo I could do a find,\nright, I could say find and\n\n319\n00:17:14.890 --> 00:17:17.250\nI could point to the root directory.\n\n320\n00:17:17.250 --> 00:17:20.766\nAnd I could look for\nfiles named ls, right?\n\n321\n00:17:20.766 --> 00:17:24.434\nSearch my hard drive and\nfind me a file called ls.\n\n322\n00:17:24.434 --> 00:17:27.370\nAll right, and when I run that,\nit starts searching.\n\n323\n00:17:27.370 --> 00:17:29.960\nAnd this is a virtual machine\nwith a 20 gig hard drive.\n\n324\n00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:31.650\nSo it won't take too terribly long.\n\n325\n00:17:31.650 --> 00:17:32.990\nBut it scanned along.\n\n326\n00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:35.780\nAnd then it found it in /bin/ls.\n\n327\n00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:38.240\nSo if I don't know where a file is,\nwhere it actually resides,\n\n328\n00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:39.620\nI can find it that way.\n\n329\n00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:42.010\nBut there's a few other commands\nwe can use to find it, too.\n\n330\n00:17:42.010 --> 00:17:44.620\nOne of the best ones is\na command called locate.\n\n331\n00:17:46.050 --> 00:17:49.380\nLocate is a neat command because\nit doesn't actually scan\n\n332\n00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:50.880\nthe whole hard drive.\n\n333\n00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:55.140\nWhat it does is,\nit maintains a database of all the files.\n\n334\n00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:57.910\nAnd it just queries its little database.\n\n335\n00:17:57.910 --> 00:18:02.320\nSo as long as our database is up to date\nand as long as we have the locate command,\n\n336\n00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:06.480\nthen we can use it to reach out and\nfind files like finding ls.\n\n337\n00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:11.490\nAnd it should find them much more quickly\nbecause it's just querying a database.\n\n338\n00:18:11.490 --> 00:18:16.630\nSo, for example,\nif I say locate \"ls\", right?\n\n339\n00:18:16.630 --> 00:18:19.750\nI can run it, and\nit's going to return to me.\n\n340\n00:18:19.750 --> 00:18:21.640\nWell, apparently it's being\na little more literal.\n\n341\n00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:24.900\nEvery single file that\ncontains the ls string.\n\n342\n00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:29.725\nSo that utils folder,\nit turned up everything in there.\n\n343\n00:18:29.725 --> 00:18:31.655\nIt's a little more literal\nthan I was looking for.\n\n344\n00:18:31.655 --> 00:18:34.470\nBut it'll return them, and it returns them\n\n345\n00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:39.120\nvery fast because it just queried straight\nagainst the database and that was it.\n\n346\n00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:42.910\nNow, if you want to use locate,\nthat's fine.\n\n347\n00:18:42.910 --> 00:18:46.770\nThe only issue is, if you've just made\na bunch of changes to the system,\n\n348\n00:18:46.770 --> 00:18:49.410\nits little database might\nnot be up to date, okay.\n\n349\n00:18:49.410 --> 00:18:52.100\nIf you're ever curious when\nthe database was updated, you can look.\n\n350\n00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:55.850\nIt's stored in,\n>> Etc.\n\n351\n00:18:55.850 --> 00:18:57.960\n>> Stores in etc?\n\n352\n00:18:57.960 --> 00:19:00.141\nIt is,\n>> Updatedb.\n\n353\n00:19:03.017 --> 00:19:05.240\nI'm just gonna pull up the config file for\nit.\n\n354\n00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:07.280\nSo, updatedb.comf, and\nyou can look in there and\n\n355\n00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:09.420\nyou can see a little bit\nof information about it.\n\n356\n00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:14.345\nIt's just kind of showing what to query,\nand you'll see it's pruning out a lot\n\n357\n00:19:14.345 --> 00:19:18.463\nof temporary paths, /tmp,\nsome of the spool and cache folders,\n\n358\n00:19:18.463 --> 00:19:22.307\ncuz files there come and go and\nyou don't wanna return those.\n\n359\n00:19:22.307 --> 00:19:27.369\n/media, cuz that's removable,\nbut I coulda sworn in here\n\n360\n00:19:27.369 --> 00:19:33.140\nit told how often the database was\nrefreshed, but it sure doesn't.\n\n361\n00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:36.936\nYeah, that location right there,\n/etc/updatedb.conf,\n\n362\n00:19:36.936 --> 00:19:40.099\nthat's the file that\ncontrols the locate command.\n\n363\n00:19:40.099 --> 00:19:45.432\nAnd it tells it what to scan and so on.\n\n364\n00:19:45.432 --> 00:19:47.478\nBut it must be if you leave it out,\nit's the default, and\n\n365\n00:19:47.478 --> 00:19:49.280\nI don't know what the default timer is.\n\n366\n00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:50.430\nWhat I generally do is,\n\n367\n00:19:50.430 --> 00:19:54.060\nif I know I made a bunch of changes,\nI just force the database to update.\n\n368\n00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:56.830\nAnd we can force it to update pretty easy.\n\n369\n00:19:56.830 --> 00:19:59.530\nBy just running updatedb.\n\n370\n00:19:59.530 --> 00:20:02.560\nAnd when you run that,\nthat forces it to update.\n\n371\n00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:06.030\nNow, a lot of distros you don't even have\nto do that because they have a cron job,\n\n372\n00:20:06.030 --> 00:20:10.000\na timer, that's scheduled to\nrun updatedb periodically.\n\n373\n00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:11.780\nBut, you can always run it yourself,\n\n374\n00:20:11.780 --> 00:20:14.682\nmanually, if you want to know\nright now that it's up to date.\n\n375\n00:20:14.682 --> 00:20:17.243\nSo, if I know I just copied\nthousands of files over,\n\n376\n00:20:17.243 --> 00:20:20.225\nthey're probably not in the database,\nI can run updatedb.\n\n377\n00:20:20.225 --> 00:20:22.987\nAnd now when I run the locate command,\n\n378\n00:20:22.987 --> 00:20:28.350\nit'll be able to find those files that\nwere just copied over, all right.\n\n379\n00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:30.600\nSo let's see if I can do it.\n\n380\n00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:35.040\nIf I do a file1.txt, all right?\n\n381\n00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:35.970\nThen I do a locate.\n\n382\n00:20:35.970 --> 00:20:37.130\nWell, wait.\nDid I already have that file?\n\n383\n00:20:37.130 --> 00:20:37.630\nNo.\n\n384\n00:20:40.308 --> 00:20:41.450\nThere we go.\n\n385\n00:20:41.450 --> 00:20:43.160\nAll right so, I created a file1.txt.\n\n386\n00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:45.820\nAnd then I did a locate file1.txt.\n\n387\n00:20:45.820 --> 00:20:48.808\nWell, the database hasn't been updated,\nso it didn't find it.\n\n388\n00:20:48.808 --> 00:20:53.518\nBut if I do an updatedb, it'll update\nthe database, it'll scan across the drive.\n\n389\n00:20:53.518 --> 00:20:55.450\nAnd it's actually running\nin the background.\n\n390\n00:20:55.450 --> 00:20:59.160\nSo it should find it shortly, but\nit might not find it right away.\n\n391\n00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:00.560\nIt did.\nPretty fast.\n\n392\n00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:01.910\nAnd so now I run it and there it is.\n\n393\n00:21:01.910 --> 00:21:03.974\nIt finds that file.\n\n394\n00:21:03.974 --> 00:21:06.433\nSo updatedb, you can create\na cron job to have it go and\n\n395\n00:21:06.433 --> 00:21:07.975\nyour distro might already do it.\n\n396\n00:21:07.975 --> 00:21:12.167\nWe'll talk about cron in an another\nepisode or you could just manually run it,\n\n397\n00:21:12.167 --> 00:21:12.810\nall right.\n\n398\n00:21:12.810 --> 00:21:13.760\nSo that's a good one.\n\n399\n00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:18.010\nThere are a few others like the whereis\ncommand, which is kind of fun.\n\n400\n00:21:18.010 --> 00:21:23.780\nIf you do whereis ls,\nit'll show you where that is stored.\n\n401\n00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:26.530\nNow, I like where s, or whereis,\n\n402\n00:21:26.530 --> 00:21:29.720\nbecause it shows a little more\nthan just where the binary is.\n\n403\n00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:33.880\nI mean that's what it starts with, right,\nthere's where the binary is, /bin/ls.\n\n404\n00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:38.560\nBut it also shows you where the package\nfile is that it was installed,\n\n405\n00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:41.220\nor sorry, the package is.\n\n406\n00:21:41.220 --> 00:21:44.030\nWell, there is no package on this one,\n'cuz it's part of the base OS.\n\n407\n00:21:44.030 --> 00:21:47.620\nSo it'll show where the package is,\nif it was installed by the package.\n\n408\n00:21:47.620 --> 00:21:51.290\nAnd then it'll show where the man\npages are, the documentation, right?\n\n409\n00:21:51.290 --> 00:21:54.590\nSo here's the man pages for it,\nand where those are stored.\n\n410\n00:21:54.590 --> 00:21:57.970\nSo it's really showing you a more\ncomplete vision of that program.\n\n411\n00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:01.960\nLet's do like whereis mysqld.\n\n412\n00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:06.210\nAll right.\nSo, that one,\n\n413\n00:22:06.210 --> 00:22:09.830\napparently, I don't have the package for\nthat one either.\n\n414\n00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:14.320\nSo, that one's showing me where\nthe binary is, and where the man file is.\n\n415\n00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:19.940\nLet me just do a quick\ndocumentation check, here.\n\n416\n00:22:19.940 --> 00:22:22.726\nIs there a tag I need to say\nto specify show the package?\n\n417\n00:22:26.641 --> 00:22:29.683\nNo, just part of it, all right.\n\n418\n00:22:29.683 --> 00:22:30.567\nSo, anyhow, whereis,\n\n419\n00:22:30.567 --> 00:22:32.932\nit's nice because it shows you\nmore than just the binary, right?\n\n420\n00:22:32.932 --> 00:22:36.609\nIt shows you where the man file is and\nwhere the packages are normally,\n\n421\n00:22:36.609 --> 00:22:38.680\nalthough mine's not returning that.\n\n422\n00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:39.190\nAll right.\n\n423\n00:22:39.190 --> 00:22:42.020\nSo, those are a couple of ways that\nwe can find files pretty quickly,\n\n424\n00:22:42.020 --> 00:22:43.950\neven if we don't understand\nthe file structure.\n\n425\n00:22:43.950 --> 00:22:46.750\nIf we do understand the file structure,\nthen I might say, I'm looking for\n\n426\n00:22:46.750 --> 00:22:47.300\nthis program.\n\n427\n00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:52.061\nSo I could look in /bin, if it was\na system executable part of the OS,\n\n428\n00:22:52.061 --> 00:22:55.427\n/sbin if it's a user\nexecutable part of the OS,\n\n429\n00:22:55.427 --> 00:23:00.355\n/user/bin, if it's a system\nexecutable that we've installed, or\n\n430\n00:23:00.355 --> 00:23:05.057\n/user/sbin, if it's a user\nexecutable that we've installed.\n\n431\n00:23:05.057 --> 00:23:07.768\nSo, if we know the structure,\nwe kinda know where to look.\n\n432\n00:23:07.768 --> 00:23:11.391\nBut we kinda have to know our program too,\nand sometimes we just don't.\n\n433\n00:23:11.391 --> 00:23:15.743\nEspecially if you're on a new system,\nyou don't know who installed what or\n\n434\n00:23:15.743 --> 00:23:18.259\nhow it works, so locate, whereis, find,\n\n435\n00:23:18.259 --> 00:23:21.600\nthose are our utilities to be\nable to go and find that data.\n\n436\n00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:25.920\nAll right, let's see a couple of other\nthings that we can use, the which command.\n\n437\n00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:28.267\nWhich only for command files.\n\n438\n00:23:28.267 --> 00:23:30.778\nSo if you have an executable,\na program, and\n\n439\n00:23:30.778 --> 00:23:34.226\nyou want to find out information about it,\nyou can run which.\n\n440\n00:23:34.226 --> 00:23:38.959\nSo If I can do which ls,\nit'll tell me information about it.\n\n441\n00:23:38.959 --> 00:23:42.571\nNotice from me when I run ls,\nI'm not just running normal,\n\n442\n00:23:42.571 --> 00:23:44.460\nls there's an alias in place.\n\n443\n00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:49.167\nSo the program is /bin/ls But\nthere's an alias that\n\n444\n00:23:49.167 --> 00:23:54.010\nsays when I run it,\nactually run ls--color=auto.\n\n445\n00:23:54.010 --> 00:23:56.750\nThat's colorizing the ls prompt.\n\n446\n00:23:56.750 --> 00:24:02.370\nIf I didn't have that,\nls doesn't normally do a colorization.\n\n447\n00:24:02.370 --> 00:24:05.320\nRight.\nSo when I did the CentOS install,\n\n448\n00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:07.710\nthey must have put that alias in there for\nme.\n\n449\n00:24:07.710 --> 00:24:10.640\nSo I could do like which shutdown.\n\n450\n00:24:12.030 --> 00:24:14.670\nSo if I wanted to shut down the system,\nthere's no alias for that one,\n\n451\n00:24:14.670 --> 00:24:21.120\nit's just /sbin/shutdown, or which, what\nother programs have I run fdisk, right.\n\n452\n00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:21.940\nSo we can go through and\n\n453\n00:24:21.940 --> 00:24:25.310\nwe can just start to find these programs\ntelling us exactly where they are.\n\n454\n00:24:25.310 --> 00:24:28.260\nBut it only works with executables,\nit doesn't work with things like\n\n455\n00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:33.300\nlibraries and text files or whatever,\nso if I do which file1.txt, right.\n\n456\n00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:34.680\nIt's not gonna return the file.\n\n457\n00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:41.600\nSee how it says, which no file1.txt in and\nthen it shows the places that it looks.\n\n458\n00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:45.520\nIf you look at the places where it looks,\nthey are all binary locations, right.\n\n459\n00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:46.989\nSo it's really just looking for programs.\n\n460\n00:24:48.710 --> 00:24:49.840\nAlright.\n\n461\n00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:55.190\nThe last one that I have on my note for\nfinding files is the type command.\n\n462\n00:24:55.190 --> 00:25:00.920\nIf you use type ls and\ntype shutdown it's giving\n\n463\n00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:05.190\nyou some basic information there also,\nreally not much different from which.\n\n464\n00:25:05.190 --> 00:25:06.280\nWhen I did type alias,\n\n465\n00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:09.370\nit's just telling me about that\nalias that's in place, right?\n\n466\n00:25:09.370 --> 00:25:12.400\nIf I did a type for\na command that didn't have any alias,\n\n467\n00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:13.630\nit jut tells me where it is.\n\n468\n00:25:13.630 --> 00:25:15.738\nSo type is very, very similar to which.\n\n469\n00:25:19.059 --> 00:25:19.760\nAll right.\n\n470\n00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:20.340\n>> Nice.\n\n471\n00:25:20.340 --> 00:25:23.730\n>> So if you're ever in doubt as to where\nsomething is, there's our way to find it.\n\n472\n00:25:25.850 --> 00:25:28.320\nAll right, I do want to talk more\nabout the file system layout.\n\n473\n00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:31.850\nAnd I want to show you guys that in\nthe perspective of doing an installation.\n\n474\n00:25:31.850 --> 00:25:35.580\nLike, when we installed the OS,\nwe let it lay out our file system for us.\n\n475\n00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:38.430\nBut I want to show you guys how it would\nbe if we wanted to manually set it up\n\n476\n00:25:38.430 --> 00:25:39.280\nourselves.\n\n477\n00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:40.880\nSo I want to walk you guys through that,\n\n478\n00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:43.280\nbut this is probably a pretty\ngood spot for a break.\n\n479\n00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:47.520\nSo why don't we do this, let's stop here\nand take a break and when we get back,\n\n480\n00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:50.051\nwe'll set up our file\nsystem via the install.\n\n481\n00:25:50.051 --> 00:25:57.568\n[MUSIC]\n\n482\n00:25:57.568 --> 00:25:59.620\nAll right, welcome back everybody.\n\n483\n00:25:59.620 --> 00:26:03.650\nSo what I want to do now is I\nwant to take a CentOS install.\n\n484\n00:26:03.650 --> 00:26:07.650\nAnd we're going to go through the process,\nbut this time I'm gonna do a manual disk\n\n485\n00:26:07.650 --> 00:26:10.190\nlayout, unlike in\nthe installation episode.\n\n486\n00:26:10.190 --> 00:26:11.580\nSo let's jump over to that.\n\n487\n00:26:11.580 --> 00:26:13.550\nI've already booted up off of my disk.\n\n488\n00:26:13.550 --> 00:26:17.240\nAnd I'm just gonna go through, and\ndo my standard install, right.\n\n489\n00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:20.970\nAnd so here it goes firing up, and we're\ngonna kinda walking through the wizard,\n\n490\n00:26:20.970 --> 00:26:22.930\nand it's gonna be just like in the a...\n\n491\n00:26:22.930 --> 00:26:25.510\nI think it was like in episode two or\nthree where we did this.\n\n492\n00:26:25.510 --> 00:26:27.730\nBut this time,\nI'm gonna change is up a little bit,\n\n493\n00:26:27.730 --> 00:26:30.010\nand I'm gonna do a manual disc layout.\n\n494\n00:26:30.010 --> 00:26:32.590\nSo we can start to kinda\nset our partitions.\n\n495\n00:26:32.590 --> 00:26:35.990\nWhen we do that, what we're defining is\nhow big we want the partitions to be.\n\n496\n00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:38.810\nAnd what mount point we want them to have.\n\n497\n00:26:38.810 --> 00:26:42.060\nAnd so we can start moving things\noff to different locations,\n\n498\n00:26:42.060 --> 00:26:44.186\nI'll skip over my disc check there, and\n\n499\n00:26:44.186 --> 00:26:47.576\nI'll show you some examples that\nI usually do in the real world.\n\n500\n00:26:50.688 --> 00:26:53.555\nSorry, I get a little hardware\nwarning there cuz I'm on VMWare, so\n\n501\n00:26:53.555 --> 00:26:57.210\nit's just warning me that my hardware\nmight not be directly supported.\n\n502\n00:26:57.210 --> 00:26:59.230\nAnd I get the pretty instal,l so\nwe'll go with that.\n\n503\n00:26:59.230 --> 00:27:01.830\nAll right, I'm just gonna tell\nit that I have basic discs,\n\n504\n00:27:01.830 --> 00:27:05.018\nno special ray controllers, and\nthat it's okay to wipe my whole drive.\n\n505\n00:27:08.132 --> 00:27:10.240\nAll right,\neventually I'll get to my disc layout.\n\n506\n00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:14.470\nJust got to provide it\nsome basic information.\n\n507\n00:27:14.470 --> 00:27:15.280\nA nice weak password.\n\n508\n00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:16.570\nHere we go, all right.\n\n509\n00:27:16.570 --> 00:27:20.030\nSo during the show the other day, I just\nwent ahead and said use all space and\n\n510\n00:27:20.030 --> 00:27:21.080\nwent that route, okay.\n\n511\n00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:22.530\nBut I'm not gonna do that today.\n\n512\n00:27:22.530 --> 00:27:24.902\nToday, I'm gonna do a custom layout.\n\n513\n00:27:24.902 --> 00:27:29.210\nI'm gonna create my own disk layout based\non my own personal needs, all right.\n\n514\n00:27:29.210 --> 00:27:30.270\nSo what it gives me.\n\n515\n00:27:30.270 --> 00:27:34.020\nIs it basically tells me I've got SDA,\nthat's hard drive A.\n\n516\n00:27:34.020 --> 00:27:36.520\nAnd that I've got 20 gigs of free space,\nand\n\n517\n00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:38.860\nI can do whatever I want with it, right.\n\n518\n00:27:38.860 --> 00:27:42.640\nWell whatever I want,\nboils down to creating partitions.\n\n519\n00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:48.000\nNow the first partition you create\nshould really be your swap partition.\n\n520\n00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:51.590\nWe need a swap partition if we ever run\nout of physical memory this is the logical\n\n521\n00:27:51.590 --> 00:27:54.760\nmemory that we'll be able to use,\nwe'll use our hard drive as extra ram.\n\n522\n00:27:54.760 --> 00:28:00.500\nAnd the rule of thumb is take however\nmuch ram you have and multiply it by two.\n\n523\n00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:02.360\nAnd then that's how big\nyour swap file should be.\n\n524\n00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:05.740\nI don't actually remember how much\nRAM I gave to this system, so\n\n525\n00:28:05.740 --> 00:28:08.230\nI'm just gonna come in here and\nI'll create a partition.\n\n526\n00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:14.280\nWe do need to make another decision here,\nwhich is do we wanna use the LVM or not?\n\n527\n00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:16.730\nRight.\nThe logical volume manager or management.\n\n528\n00:28:16.730 --> 00:28:19.340\nIf we want to use that,\nwe can choose to use the LVM here,\n\n529\n00:28:19.340 --> 00:28:21.940\nin which case we'll have to\nstart creating logical volumes.\n\n530\n00:28:21.940 --> 00:28:23.580\nAll right.\nI'm gonna go ahead and do that,\n\n531\n00:28:23.580 --> 00:28:25.480\njust cuz it's not a bad idea to do it.\n\n532\n00:28:26.780 --> 00:28:29.810\nAnd so I'm gonna create\na physical volume here SDA.\n\n533\n00:28:31.410 --> 00:28:35.145\nSize, 200 megabytes,\nthat's not what I want.\n\n534\n00:28:35.145 --> 00:28:38.290\nI want the whole thing.\n\n535\n00:28:38.290 --> 00:28:40.230\n20473, so\nI'm just gonna punch in the whole thing.\n\n536\n00:28:40.230 --> 00:28:41.740\nI guess I could say fill all space.\n\n537\n00:28:41.740 --> 00:28:43.430\nThat would have saved me some time.\n\n538\n00:28:43.430 --> 00:28:46.238\nAnd so we'll just go ahead and\nsay fill it all.\n\n539\n00:28:46.238 --> 00:28:49.190\nAnd hit OK.\n\n540\n00:28:49.190 --> 00:28:49.700\nSo there we go.\n\n541\n00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:54.760\nSo now I've got the LVM that is\nbasically spanning my entire drive.\n\n542\n00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:59.700\nAnd from there,\nI can start to create a volume group.\n\n543\n00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:03.610\nI'm basically doing all the things we\ndid from the command line the other day.\n\n544\n00:29:03.610 --> 00:29:05.840\nAnd so I'll create a volume group\nthat's just the whole thing.\n\n545\n00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:07.440\nDefault name is Wall group.\n\n546\n00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:11.420\nI like vg1 personally, but\nyou can call it whatever you want.\n\n547\n00:29:13.050 --> 00:29:16.830\nAnd so well create that and then we\ncan start add in our logical volumes.\n\n548\n00:29:16.830 --> 00:29:20.280\nNow those logical volumes are the ones\nthat we need to tie to our various\n\n549\n00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:21.260\nmount points.\n\n550\n00:29:21.260 --> 00:29:26.050\nAnd so I'm gonna add in one and this first\none I'm gonna be mounting to a swap.\n\n551\n00:29:26.050 --> 00:29:29.970\nNow if you drop it down you seek\ncommon options here for folders.\n\n552\n00:29:29.970 --> 00:29:31.660\nAnd swap doesn't have a folder.\n\n553\n00:29:31.660 --> 00:29:34.570\nAnd that's because swap is technically\nRAM, and you don't want to go and\n\n554\n00:29:34.570 --> 00:29:36.180\nmess around in RAM.\n\n555\n00:29:36.180 --> 00:29:37.430\nAnd so we don't really choose that.\n\n556\n00:29:37.430 --> 00:29:42.390\nWhat we do is, here under File System\nType, we have swap as an option.\n\n557\n00:29:42.390 --> 00:29:45.148\nAnd when you choose swap,\nsee how the mount point went away?\n\n558\n00:29:45.148 --> 00:29:48.950\nSo I'm gonna come in here and\nI'm gonna create just 1 gig of swap.\n\n559\n00:29:48.950 --> 00:29:54.010\nJust cuz I don't know how\nmuch RAM I have [LAUGH].\n\n560\n00:29:54.010 --> 00:29:55.640\nAnd I'm gonna call this lv1.\n\n561\n00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:57.430\nAll right.\n\n562\n00:29:57.430 --> 00:30:00.660\nSo there's my swap partition\nwith no mount point.\n\n563\n00:30:00.660 --> 00:30:05.360\nThen I'm gonna start adding in other\npartitions that I want to deal with.\n\n564\n00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:06.120\nOkay.\n\n565\n00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:08.520\nI've got roughly a 20 GB hard drive.\n\n566\n00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:10.160\nI can see how much free space I have here.\n\n567\n00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:12.280\nI'm down to about 19 GB.\n\n568\n00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:16.300\nAnd what I wanna do is\nI want to set up about\n\n569\n00:30:17.850 --> 00:30:22.090\nlet's say, I'll do 4 gigs to the os,\nthe main root folder.\n\n570\n00:30:22.090 --> 00:30:27.300\nSo I'm gonna go and create a /,\nwhich is my main drive.\n\n571\n00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:34.260\nI'll call this lv2 and I'm gonna set\nit up for about 4 gigs of space.\n\n572\n00:30:34.260 --> 00:30:38.800\nNow 4 gigs doesn't sound like a lot,\nbut it'll hold my CentOS installation,\n\n573\n00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:42.190\nit'll fit in there just fine and so\nI can see my space that I've got left and\n\n574\n00:30:42.190 --> 00:30:43.980\nI'm gonna continue dividing things up.\n\n575\n00:30:43.980 --> 00:30:46.530\nNow in the install the other day,\nwe stopped right there.\n\n576\n00:30:46.530 --> 00:30:49.700\nSwap and a slash which filled up\nthe whole rest of the drive, right.\n\n577\n00:30:49.700 --> 00:30:51.650\nEverything was inside of there.\n\n578\n00:30:51.650 --> 00:30:54.760\nBut now what I can do is I can come in and\nI can say, you know what?\n\n579\n00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:57.900\nI want my VAR files, right?\n\n580\n00:30:57.900 --> 00:31:00.240\nWhere my web files and\nstuff like that are gonna be.\n\n581\n00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:05.211\nI want them on their own partition and so\nI can come in here and I can take /var.\n\n582\n00:31:05.211 --> 00:31:08.050\nAnd you can actually type in this field,\nso\n\n583\n00:31:08.050 --> 00:31:11.330\nwe could do this with any\ndirectory if you want it.\n\n584\n00:31:11.330 --> 00:31:15.080\nBut how do you /var,\nI'm gonna make that lv3 and\n\n585\n00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:19.420\nI'm gonna give it 5 gigs of space,\nall right.\n\n586\n00:31:19.420 --> 00:31:20.546\nSo now I've got 5 gigs of space.\n\n587\n00:31:20.546 --> 00:31:24.380\nSpace in /var, and I'll add in more.\n\n588\n00:31:24.380 --> 00:31:26.502\nI'm gonna say, all right what about /home?\n\n589\n00:31:26.502 --> 00:31:30.064\nI don't want a user starting to\njust download a ton of stuff and\n\n590\n00:31:30.064 --> 00:31:33.709\nfill up my hard drive and\nall of a sudden programs stop working.\n\n591\n00:31:33.709 --> 00:31:38.002\nSo I'm gonna move /home\nto it's own location.\n\n592\n00:31:38.002 --> 00:31:43.658\nWhich will be lv4 for\nme and I'll give it 4 gigs.\n\n593\n00:31:43.658 --> 00:31:46.319\nAll right, so there goes it got 4 gigs.\n\n594\n00:31:46.319 --> 00:31:49.790\nAnd then I can even go further and\nI can say, what about /temp?\n\n595\n00:31:49.790 --> 00:31:51.310\nI'm worried about temporary files.\n\n596\n00:31:51.310 --> 00:31:52.980\nAgain, what if those\nfill up the hard drive.\n\n597\n00:31:52.980 --> 00:31:54.840\nI don't want my programs crashing.\n\n598\n00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:57.780\nAnd so I can come in and\nI can add in /temp.\n\n599\n00:31:57.780 --> 00:31:59.130\nIt's not in the list.\n\n600\n00:31:59.130 --> 00:31:59.975\nNo, it is.\nAll right,\n\n601\n00:31:59.975 --> 00:32:01.608\nthought I was gonna have to type that one.\n\n602\n00:32:01.608 --> 00:32:03.328\nWhat am I up to, lv 5?\n\n603\n00:32:03.328 --> 00:32:05.115\nYeah, so the logical volume five.\n\n604\n00:32:05.115 --> 00:32:08.609\nI could name these like, LV-TMP and\nthen I would know, yeah,\n\n605\n00:32:08.609 --> 00:32:10.145\nthat's the temporary one.\n\n606\n00:32:10.145 --> 00:32:12.645\nSo you can name them however you want.\n\n607\n00:32:12.645 --> 00:32:14.823\nMaybe I'll give this one just 2 gigs,\n\n608\n00:32:14.823 --> 00:32:17.873\nI don't want anymore than\n2 gigs of temporary files.\n\n609\n00:32:17.873 --> 00:32:21.023\nAnd I've got some extra space,\nbut I'm gonna leave that there.\n\n610\n00:32:21.023 --> 00:32:24.960\nI'm gonna leave this extra four and a half\ngigs available because if I ever run out,\n\n611\n00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:28.394\nremember from yesterday's episode,\nI can stretch a logical volume and\n\n612\n00:32:28.394 --> 00:32:29.198\nmake it bigger.\n\n613\n00:32:29.198 --> 00:32:32.206\nSo I've got some extra space\nI'm just gonna sit on, and\n\n614\n00:32:32.206 --> 00:32:36.305\nif I ever see one of my partitions getting\nlow on space, I can expand it out and\n\n615\n00:32:36.305 --> 00:32:37.798\ngive it some more, right?\n\n616\n00:32:37.798 --> 00:32:42.500\nOr I can take one of my other logical\nvolumes and expand it right now.\n\n617\n00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:46.070\nWhen I say okay,\nhere's my layout, all right?\n\n618\n00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:52.540\nI'm gonna have /temp with 2 gigs,\n/home with four gigs, /var with 5 gigs.\n\n619\n00:32:52.540 --> 00:32:56.170\nEvery other directory /etc, /usr, /bin,\n\n620\n00:32:56.170 --> 00:33:01.700\n/spn all those other ones,\nthey're gonna fall under the root.\n\n621\n00:33:01.700 --> 00:33:04.280\nAnd for the root, I gave it 2 gigs.\n\n622\n00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:06.850\nAll right, now I haven't written any\nof this, so if I change my mind,\n\n623\n00:33:06.850 --> 00:33:09.520\nif I want to bump that up to 6 gigs,\nI still can.\n\n624\n00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:11.590\nSo I can come in here and\ncrank that up a bit.\n\n625\n00:33:12.870 --> 00:33:15.500\nSo now I've got 6 gigs for\nthe rest of the OS, for\n\n626\n00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:18.170\nevery folder that I haven't mounted.\n\n627\n00:33:18.170 --> 00:33:20.328\n>> Don, I have a question.\n\n628\n00:33:20.328 --> 00:33:24.892\nIs there a reason you can think\nof that you might choose to\n\n629\n00:33:24.892 --> 00:33:27.816\nname your own folder at this point?\n\n630\n00:33:27.816 --> 00:33:29.156\n>> You could.\n>> Instead of actually using the file.\n\n631\n00:33:29.156 --> 00:33:30.956\n>> Yeah, if you have a special use folder.\n\n632\n00:33:30.956 --> 00:33:31.536\n>> Okay.\n\n633\n00:33:31.536 --> 00:33:37.646\n>> Right, if I know that I'm gonna\nbe storing some kind of data\n\n634\n00:33:37.646 --> 00:33:43.018\nimports in a folder that's gonna be slash-\n>> Marketing or some other example.\n\n635\n00:33:43.018 --> 00:33:45.500\n>> Yeah, /import just something like that.\n\n636\n00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:47.410\nWe could certainly come in and do that.\n\n637\n00:33:47.410 --> 00:33:52.840\nAnd whoops, I need to click up here.\n\n638\n00:33:52.840 --> 00:33:53.630\nAm I out of space?\n\n639\n00:33:53.630 --> 00:33:54.710\n>> No, you need to choose free.\n\n640\n00:33:56.358 --> 00:33:57.608\nYeah.\nThat would make a difference, wouldn't it?\n\n641\n00:33:57.608 --> 00:34:00.590\n[LAUGH] You're trying to create\none that's already there.\n\n642\n00:34:00.590 --> 00:34:01.510\nSo I can come in here and\n\n643\n00:34:01.510 --> 00:34:05.760\nI can create another logical volume,\nand I can come in and, you know what?\n\n644\n00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:07.516\nActually, I need to create.\n\n645\n00:34:10.284 --> 00:34:10.896\n>> Shoot.\n\n646\n00:34:14.206 --> 00:34:16.250\nThere we go.\nI need to edit the volume.\n\n647\n00:34:16.250 --> 00:34:16.800\n>> Yeah, yeah.\n\n648\n00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:18.840\n>> So I can come in here and\nadd that logical volume and\n\n649\n00:34:18.840 --> 00:34:21.710\nI can specify in /imports, right?\n\n650\n00:34:21.710 --> 00:34:23.780\nAnd maybe that's where I'm\ngonna be doing data imports.\n\n651\n00:34:23.780 --> 00:34:26.318\nAnd again,\nI wanna have it special limited whatever.\n\n652\n00:34:26.318 --> 00:34:28.956\nI don't even know what LV\nnumber I'm up to now, lv6.\n\n653\n00:34:28.956 --> 00:34:30.750\nAnd so I can come in a specify that.\n\n654\n00:34:30.750 --> 00:34:34.440\nNow here's a folder that wouldn't\nnormally exist on a system.\n\n655\n00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:36.840\nBut, now when I'm done, it is.\n\n656\n00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:38.749\nIt's going to exist,\nthere is going to be a /imports.\n\n657\n00:34:38.749 --> 00:34:43.422\nNow, it's gonna be empty, cuz the system\ndoesn't know what to put in there, but\n\n658\n00:34:43.422 --> 00:34:45.810\nit'll take care of it, all right?\n\n659\n00:34:45.810 --> 00:34:49.730\nSo now we've kinda laid out that\nlogical volume with our structure.\n\n660\n00:34:49.730 --> 00:34:51.588\nThe install is gonna\ncontinue on like normal.\n\n661\n00:34:51.588 --> 00:34:55.733\nIt's just whenever it writes to /home,\nit's gonna write to the special partition,\n\n662\n00:34:55.733 --> 00:34:56.318\nor /temp.\n\n663\n00:34:56.318 --> 00:34:58.850\nTo this special partition or\nvolume, right?\n\n664\n00:34:58.850 --> 00:35:01.830\nSo now we can create that custom\nlayout just the way we want it.\n\n665\n00:35:01.830 --> 00:35:03.710\nThat's kind of cool stuff.\n\n666\n00:35:03.710 --> 00:35:05.330\nIt's considered advanced.\n\n667\n00:35:05.330 --> 00:35:08.428\nBecause most users don't,\nwell most end users, desktop users,\n\n668\n00:35:08.428 --> 00:35:11.268\ndon't know enough about their\nneeds to do this, all right?\n\n669\n00:35:11.268 --> 00:35:14.008\nBut if you're working on servers,\nthis is really common.\n\n670\n00:35:14.008 --> 00:35:14.860\nAnd for me,\n\n671\n00:35:14.860 --> 00:35:20.240\nwhat I do is when I'm spinning up\na bunch of servers on Amazon EC2, right?\n\n672\n00:35:21.810 --> 00:35:25.710\nMaybe I wanna build a web server and I\nwant that web server to be able to scale.\n\n673\n00:35:25.710 --> 00:35:30.143\nSo, I build up one web server and\nthen I say if it hits 80% CPU,\n\n674\n00:35:30.143 --> 00:35:32.460\nclone it and spin up a second one.\n\n675\n00:35:32.460 --> 00:35:36.100\nAnd if it hits 80% CPU, clone it and spin\nup a third one, spin a thousand of them.\n\n676\n00:35:36.100 --> 00:35:41.100\nRight, that’s how websites like Reddit and\nFacebook and stuff like that.\n\n677\n00:35:41.100 --> 00:35:42.090\nThat's how they work.\n\n678\n00:35:42.090 --> 00:35:44.055\nThe spin up more servers\nas they need them.\n\n679\n00:35:44.055 --> 00:35:48.350\nWell, when you spin up that server,\nyou need to have a base image that says,\n\n680\n00:35:48.350 --> 00:35:49.970\nhere's the OS, here's whatever.\n\n681\n00:35:49.970 --> 00:35:52.490\nAnd it's really identical\nacross all those systems.\n\n682\n00:35:52.490 --> 00:35:55.370\nWhat's different might be\nthe webpage content, right?\n\n683\n00:35:55.370 --> 00:35:57.370\nIf the webpage has been up to date,\n\n684\n00:35:57.370 --> 00:36:00.510\nthat image that I'm cloning\nwith might be outdated.\n\n685\n00:36:00.510 --> 00:36:05.260\nSo, we can move our website like /var to\na separate partition, to a separate drive.\n\n686\n00:36:05.260 --> 00:36:08.448\nIt can be a completely different\nhard drive if we wanted, right?\n\n687\n00:36:08.448 --> 00:36:09.832\nAnd then in that scenario,\n\n688\n00:36:09.832 --> 00:36:13.208\nall I have to do is clone that extra\nhard drive between the systems.\n\n689\n00:36:13.208 --> 00:36:16.392\nThat's what I'll normally do, just have\nthem spin up and have them use rsync or\n\n690\n00:36:16.392 --> 00:36:19.290\nsomething to make sure they've got\nthe latest version of the webpage and\n\n691\n00:36:19.290 --> 00:36:20.840\nthen they go live in the pool.\n\n692\n00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:24.400\nAnd so you can spin up thousands\nof servers at a moment's notice\n\n693\n00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:25.450\nwhen you're busy.\n\n694\n00:36:25.450 --> 00:36:27.813\nAnd then when things slow down,\nyou can prune off those servers, and\n\n695\n00:36:27.813 --> 00:36:28.928\nyou can really save some money.\n\n696\n00:36:28.928 --> 00:36:31.188\nThat's where those services\nreally come in handy.\n\n697\n00:36:31.188 --> 00:36:33.088\nSo I wish I had thought\nabout it ahead of time,\n\n698\n00:36:33.088 --> 00:36:34.748\nI would have added a second hard drive.\n\n699\n00:36:34.748 --> 00:36:37.830\nAll of these I created\ninside of this volume group.\n\n700\n00:36:37.830 --> 00:36:41.000\nAnd remember, a volume group can\ncontain more than one hard drive.\n\n701\n00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:45.428\nSo if I had sda, sdb, sdc, I could\nput them all in this volume group and\n\n702\n00:36:45.428 --> 00:36:49.198\nthese folders would now be\nspread across all those drives.\n\n703\n00:36:49.198 --> 00:36:52.902\nIf your dealing with SQL data like\nMySQL databases or Oracle or whatever,\n\n704\n00:36:52.902 --> 00:36:56.307\nyou might want to have their transaction\nlogs on one set of drives and\n\n705\n00:36:56.307 --> 00:36:58.598\nthe database files on\nanother set of drives.\n\n706\n00:36:58.598 --> 00:37:02.600\nAnd so this is how we would achieve that,\nby mounting these folders, all right?\n\n707\n00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:05.010\nThe folders themselves\nare called mount points.\n\n708\n00:37:05.010 --> 00:37:08.250\nIt's the point of reference,\nhow we get into that partition, and\n\n709\n00:37:08.250 --> 00:37:10.890\nso if you have something\nwithout a mount point,\n\n710\n00:37:10.890 --> 00:37:13.590\nyou can't get into it until you\nmount it with the mount command.\n\n711\n00:37:13.590 --> 00:37:17.822\nAnd what we're really doing here is\neffectively editing our FS tab file.\n\n712\n00:37:17.822 --> 00:37:21.620\nThe fstab file, that file system table\nthat we saw in the last episode.\n\n713\n00:37:21.620 --> 00:37:22.780\nThat's what we're modifying right here.\n\n714\n00:37:24.690 --> 00:37:26.750\nAll right, and when I hit Next,\nit's gonna create that.\n\n715\n00:37:26.750 --> 00:37:30.350\nNow it's telling me my bootable\npartition can't be in a logical volume.\n\n716\n00:37:30.350 --> 00:37:33.240\nSo, I need to actually add /boot and\nshoot, you know what?\n\n717\n00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:34.780\nI didn't leave enough room for that.\n\n718\n00:37:34.780 --> 00:37:37.280\nThis is where if you let the wizard do it,\nyou're kind of better off.\n\n719\n00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:40.818\nBut my volume group is a little too big,\nso I need to shrink it down.\n\n720\n00:37:40.818 --> 00:37:42.978\nWhich is it gonna let me do that now?\n\n721\n00:37:42.978 --> 00:37:45.640\nIt might be too late, I might have\nto redo my file system layout.\n\n722\n00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:48.650\nSee that's where we get in trouble by\ndoing some of this stuff ourselves.\n\n723\n00:37:48.650 --> 00:37:56.490\nSo if I reset this, what I need to do is\nI need to create my boot volume first.\n\n724\n00:37:56.490 --> 00:37:57.988\nIt can't be inside of a logical volume.\n\n725\n00:37:57.988 --> 00:37:59.928\nSo I can create a standard partition.\n\n726\n00:37:59.928 --> 00:38:03.157\nAnd it doesn't need to be very big for\n/boot.\n\n727\n00:38:03.157 --> 00:38:07.900\nAnd here, they're recommending 200 megs, I\nmight bump it up just a little bit to 300.\n\n728\n00:38:07.900 --> 00:38:12.398\nAnd so there's my /bot and then\neverything else can go inside of the lvm.\n\n729\n00:38:12.398 --> 00:38:14.338\nMaybe I don't wanna use the lvm, right?\n\n730\n00:38:14.338 --> 00:38:15.178\nI don't have to.\n\n731\n00:38:15.178 --> 00:38:19.318\nI can come through and\ncreate a standard partition that\n\n732\n00:38:19.318 --> 00:38:23.648\nmounts to / that is 6 gigs right here,\nso I'll do that.\n\n733\n00:38:23.648 --> 00:38:24.584\nAnd then I can just go in and\n\n734\n00:38:24.584 --> 00:38:27.166\nstart creating the other ones,\nnot using the logical volume manager.\n\n735\n00:38:27.166 --> 00:38:28.220\nNow it's gonna it make harder for\n\n736\n00:38:28.220 --> 00:38:33.860\nme later on if I wanna move them but\nwe can knock them out just this way.\n\n737\n00:38:33.860 --> 00:38:38.280\nSo maybe I'll take /home and\nmake that 4 gigs.\n\n738\n00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:44.328\nAnd maybe I'll do /var also,\nand stop there.\n\n739\n00:38:44.328 --> 00:38:49.276\nOr I'll do /temp, so that I can hold\n/temp down to 2 gigs in size, okay?\n\n740\n00:38:49.276 --> 00:38:51.612\nSo now,\n/var is just gonna end up inside of root,\n\n741\n00:38:51.612 --> 00:38:54.100\nwhich means it'll be limited to 6 gigs.\n\n742\n00:38:54.100 --> 00:38:56.914\nAll right, so I'll just go ahead and\nlay it out like that and\n\n743\n00:38:56.914 --> 00:38:58.220\nthat should make it happy.\n\n744\n00:38:58.220 --> 00:39:01.563\n[LAUGH] I forgot the swap file.\n\n745\n00:39:01.563 --> 00:39:04.283\n[LAUGH] All right, well it is nice\nthat it's warning me about that,\n\n746\n00:39:04.283 --> 00:39:06.300\notherwise we'd be really in trouble.\n\n747\n00:39:06.300 --> 00:39:09.191\nSo let me go back here,\nI'm gonna create another one, and\n\n748\n00:39:09.191 --> 00:39:10.848\nwe will create a swap partition.\n\n749\n00:39:13.568 --> 00:39:15.048\nAnd what did I do for a swap size?\n\n750\n00:39:15.048 --> 00:39:16.528\nI think I did 1 gig before.\n\n751\n00:39:16.528 --> 00:39:19.060\n>> Yeah.\n>> Well do 2 this time, I got the space.\n\n752\n00:39:19.060 --> 00:39:20.350\nAll right, there we go.\n\n753\n00:39:20.350 --> 00:39:24.570\nSo now I've got the requisite\npieces to get this thing going.\n\n754\n00:39:24.570 --> 00:39:27.090\nAnd let's see,\npre-existing devices have been selected.\n\n755\n00:39:27.090 --> 00:39:29.171\nSo it's just warning me here it's gonna\nwipe my drive, I'm okay with that.\n\n756\n00:39:30.828 --> 00:39:31.960\nAnd there we go.\n\n757\n00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:35.782\nAll right, so doing our own layout,\nnot a big deal, it's just we do have to\n\n758\n00:39:35.782 --> 00:39:38.834\nunderstand the needs of our system and\nwhat it's gonna do.\n\n759\n00:39:38.834 --> 00:39:41.127\nAnd so from here,\nI can just continue with the install.\n\n760\n00:39:41.127 --> 00:39:44.398\nIt's gonna install it and it'll now\nbe following the mount points that we\n\n761\n00:39:44.398 --> 00:39:46.468\nspecified, and\nwe don't have to watch that.\n\n762\n00:39:46.468 --> 00:39:47.288\nWe can just let it run.\n\n763\n00:39:47.288 --> 00:39:49.858\nBut that is basically it.\n\n764\n00:39:49.858 --> 00:39:53.180\nSo instead of, well,\nI guess I could let it finish.\n\n765\n00:39:53.180 --> 00:39:59.140\nLet me do a basic server install and\nwe'll let it churn along.\n\n766\n00:39:59.140 --> 00:40:00.630\nIt won't take very long.\n\n767\n00:40:00.630 --> 00:40:03.170\nWhile it's running, so\nit's just gonna do the install.\n\n768\n00:40:03.170 --> 00:40:07.800\nAnd after the install it's gonna ask\nabout installing the bootloader, right?\n\n769\n00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:12.140\nNow we mentioned that the bootloader for\nCentOS is Grub2, and\n\n770\n00:40:12.140 --> 00:40:15.240\nmost distributions these\ndays are using Grub2.\n\n771\n00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:18.490\nWhen we install it it is going\nto install it into /boot,\n\n772\n00:40:18.490 --> 00:40:21.370\nas far as where the files for it are.\n\n773\n00:40:21.370 --> 00:40:25.610\nAnd then it's gonna put a little entry\nin the master boot record of SDA,\n\n774\n00:40:25.610 --> 00:40:29.060\nof that first hard drive,\nthat says when you boot up, look to /boot.\n\n775\n00:40:29.060 --> 00:40:31.370\nYou've just got to know how to look there.\n\n776\n00:40:31.370 --> 00:40:34.340\nAnd so, grub actually has two pieces.\n\n777\n00:40:34.340 --> 00:40:37.090\nThe part that's entered in in\nyour master boot record, and\n\n778\n00:40:37.090 --> 00:40:40.840\nthen the part that's entered in in /boot,\nthose files that are there.\n\n779\n00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:43.730\nAnd it is possible that things can\nbreak or not get put in place.\n\n780\n00:40:43.730 --> 00:40:45.710\nSo we might have to manipulate that.\n\n781\n00:40:45.710 --> 00:40:46.790\nHopefully you don't have to.\n\n782\n00:40:46.790 --> 00:40:50.750\nHopefully it does it for you and\neverything just works and that's it.\n\n783\n00:40:50.750 --> 00:40:53.430\nBut if you ever have to manipulate it,\nGrub is really not that bad.\n\n784\n00:40:53.430 --> 00:40:54.450\nAll right.\n\n785\n00:40:54.450 --> 00:40:55.550\nSo let's take a look at it.\n\n786\n00:40:55.550 --> 00:40:56.500\nAnd I'm impatient.\n\n787\n00:40:56.500 --> 00:40:57.910\nSo I'm not gonna wait on this server.\n\n788\n00:40:57.910 --> 00:41:02.020\nSo let me jump over to one of my\nother servers that's all ready done.\n\n789\n00:41:02.020 --> 00:41:02.970\nThis one.\n\n790\n00:41:02.970 --> 00:41:03.630\nAll right.\n\n791\n00:41:03.630 --> 00:41:08.350\nSo here's the server that I've been\nworking with all week, and basically,\n\n792\n00:41:08.350 --> 00:41:09.270\nit's already up.\n\n793\n00:41:09.270 --> 00:41:11.990\nIt's a basic install,\njust like I'm doing in the other window.\n\n794\n00:41:11.990 --> 00:41:15.010\nThe only difference is,\nI didn't do all those various folders.\n\n795\n00:41:15.010 --> 00:41:18.350\nEverything's pretty much mounted\ninto one big, logical volume,\n\n796\n00:41:18.350 --> 00:41:21.200\nso I can see it kind of laid out there.\n\n797\n00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:26.710\nAnd if I take a look inside of /boot, so\nI'm just changing into that directory and\n\n798\n00:41:26.710 --> 00:41:29.910\nI'll pull up the files that are in there,\nthere's quite a bit of stuff in there.\n\n799\n00:41:29.910 --> 00:41:32.900\nAnd if we just kind of glance down\nthe list of what's in there you'll notice\n\n800\n00:41:32.900 --> 00:41:34.310\nthere's a folder called grub.\n\n801\n00:41:34.310 --> 00:41:41.340\nAll right, you'll also see other things\nin here like the vmlinuz, vmlinuz.\n\n802\n00:41:41.340 --> 00:41:42.820\nThose files that I mentioned.\n\n803\n00:41:42.820 --> 00:41:45.940\nWell that is the boot loader for Linux.\n\n804\n00:41:45.940 --> 00:41:48.720\nSo when you boot Linux,\nit's actually those files,\n\n805\n00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:52.130\nthe ones that are in green, those are\nthe ones that we're calling to boot up.\n\n806\n00:41:52.130 --> 00:41:55.860\nAll right so you'll see those files\nin there that's what we're calling.\n\n807\n00:41:55.860 --> 00:41:58.780\nThere will be a fully qualified name here.\n\n808\n00:41:58.780 --> 00:42:01.570\nWhich will be, a nice big long file name.\n\n809\n00:42:01.570 --> 00:42:05.360\nAnd then, there may be other ones left\nbehind from upgrades that you've done.\n\n810\n00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:07.420\nIt always likes to keep previous versions,\nso\n\n811\n00:42:07.420 --> 00:42:09.350\nif there's a problem\nwe can boot from them.\n\n812\n00:42:09.350 --> 00:42:11.790\nAnd sometimes it'll do sim links,\nso these actually tie together,\n\n813\n00:42:11.790 --> 00:42:14.530\nit just depends on how your\nsystem is set up right.\n\n814\n00:42:14.530 --> 00:42:18.720\nBut let's take a look in that grub folder,\nat what's in there.\n\n815\n00:42:18.720 --> 00:42:20.280\nThis one's a little less intimidating.\n\n816\n00:42:20.280 --> 00:42:23.640\nThere's a lot of files in here that we\ndon't necessarily need to mess with that\n\n817\n00:42:23.640 --> 00:42:26.720\nhave to do with the way the system boots.\n\n818\n00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:29.318\nSo you'll see a lot of stuff\nhere based on file systems.\n\n819\n00:42:29.318 --> 00:42:34.058\nFat, minix, reiserfs, ufs, xfs.\n\n820\n00:42:34.058 --> 00:42:36.370\nThese are all different file\nsystems that are out there.\n\n821\n00:42:36.370 --> 00:42:39.750\nSo it's basically anything\nthat ends in stage1_5,\n\n822\n00:42:39.750 --> 00:42:42.670\nthose are file systems that it\nneeds to be able to recognize.\n\n823\n00:42:42.670 --> 00:42:46.440\nThe files that we really care about in\nhere are, well if you kinda run down\n\n824\n00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:50.750\nthe list, grub.conf,\nthat's the configuration file for grub.\n\n825\n00:42:50.750 --> 00:42:52.100\nThat's really the one I care about,\n\n826\n00:42:52.100 --> 00:42:57.310\nbecause it's the one that controls\nhow we boot our OSs, all right?\n\n827\n00:42:57.310 --> 00:43:00.120\nYou'll also see menu.list,\n\n828\n00:43:00.120 --> 00:43:03.510\nnow in older operating systems,\nmenu.list was its own file.\n\n829\n00:43:03.510 --> 00:43:08.100\nIn newer ones it actually\nlinks right back to grub.conf.\n\n830\n00:43:08.100 --> 00:43:10.550\nAnd so, in that file we don't just\nhave our configuration anymore.\n\n831\n00:43:10.550 --> 00:43:14.680\nNow we have the menu when we boot up\nthe menu of operating systems that we can\n\n832\n00:43:14.680 --> 00:43:16.820\nchoose to boot, all right.\n\n833\n00:43:16.820 --> 00:43:19.270\nAnd then you have your splash image,\nright?\n\n834\n00:43:19.270 --> 00:43:21.985\nA lot of Linux systems when they\nboot up they display a picture.\n\n835\n00:43:21.985 --> 00:43:23.530\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And so they look pretty.\n\n836\n00:43:23.530 --> 00:43:25.160\n>> Nice.\n>> And that's where that is.\n\n837\n00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:25.970\nYou don't have to have that.\n\n838\n00:43:25.970 --> 00:43:27.680\nYou can still boot the old text way.\n\n839\n00:43:27.680 --> 00:43:32.360\nIn fact, I think it was my Debian\ninstall that is doing the text way\n\n840\n00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:34.850\nversus my CentOS one that\nis displaying the image.\n\n841\n00:43:34.850 --> 00:43:38.990\nSo you don't have to have that, but those\nare the main files that are in there.\n\n842\n00:43:38.990 --> 00:43:43.590\nAnd when we need to work with grub, it's\nusually grub.com that we're going for.\n\n843\n00:43:43.590 --> 00:43:44.870\nLet's take a look inside of that.\n\n844\n00:43:47.720 --> 00:43:48.600\nSo I'm just going to edit it.\n\n845\n00:43:48.600 --> 00:43:51.180\nAnd you'll see that there's\nsome messages up top here,\n\n846\n00:43:51.180 --> 00:43:53.550\nwhich is just telling\nus general information.\n\n847\n00:43:53.550 --> 00:43:56.668\nThey have a pound symbol before them, so\nthat means that they're commented out,\n\n848\n00:43:56.668 --> 00:43:57.718\nthey don't actually run.\n\n849\n00:43:57.718 --> 00:44:01.494\nThe first command here that runs is\nthe one that says default equals 0.\n\n850\n00:44:01.494 --> 00:44:05.248\nAll right, we're gonna have\na list of operating systems and\n\n851\n00:44:05.248 --> 00:44:07.450\nit numbers them from 0 up.\n\n852\n00:44:07.450 --> 00:44:11.820\nDefault equals 0 means boot whichever\noperating system is listed first.\n\n853\n00:44:11.820 --> 00:44:14.530\nIf we change that to default equals 1,\nthat would say boot whatever\n\n854\n00:44:14.530 --> 00:44:17.490\noperating system is listed second,\nor third and fourth and so on.\n\n855\n00:44:17.490 --> 00:44:20.110\nSo you can manipulate which OS\nit's gonna boot by default.\n\n856\n00:44:21.410 --> 00:44:22.340\nThe next is the time out.\n\n857\n00:44:22.340 --> 00:44:26.400\nWe're going to display this menu for\nfive seconds.\n\n858\n00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:29.190\nIf you don't pick something in five\nseconds, we'll go with the default,\n\n859\n00:44:29.190 --> 00:44:30.310\nall right?\n\n860\n00:44:30.310 --> 00:44:31.310\nWell, maybe I want more time.\n\n861\n00:44:31.310 --> 00:44:34.800\nI'm going to display that menu for\n20 seconds.\n\n862\n00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:38.326\nSo now you've got 20 seconds to pick what\nyou want and then it'll boot the default.\n\n863\n00:44:38.326 --> 00:44:39.486\n>> Nice.\n\n864\n00:44:39.486 --> 00:44:42.650\n>> All right,\nnext we've got our splash image, right.\n\n865\n00:44:42.650 --> 00:44:46.120\nAnd notice how it references the splash\nimage, it doesn't point to slash boot\n\n866\n00:44:46.120 --> 00:44:49.910\nwhatever, it points to it based\non a hard drive, all right.\n\n867\n00:44:49.910 --> 00:44:54.120\nAt this stage in the game when the system\nis just hitting the boot loader\n\n868\n00:44:54.120 --> 00:44:57.840\nit hasn't mounted all these partitions\nyet, it doesn't know what slash boot is.\n\n869\n00:44:57.840 --> 00:45:00.240\nSo we have to tell it,\ngo to this hard drive.\n\n870\n00:45:00.240 --> 00:45:01.788\nHard drive 0, partition 0 right?\n\n871\n00:45:01.788 --> 00:45:03.400\nThat's really our-\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n872\n00:45:03.400 --> 00:45:04.210\n>> Boot.\n\n873\n00:45:04.210 --> 00:45:05.470\nOur master boot record.\n\n874\n00:45:05.470 --> 00:45:08.980\nSo go there and then ask Grub where.\n\n875\n00:45:08.980 --> 00:45:12.000\nAnd Grub will actually take care\nof mounting to where /boot is and\n\n876\n00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:12.910\nfigure it out.\n\n877\n00:45:12.910 --> 00:45:14.160\nAnd so that's how it's able to find that.\n\n878\n00:45:14.160 --> 00:45:15.145\nSo it's kind of a weird reference.\n\n879\n00:45:15.145 --> 00:45:16.250\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> But that's how it works.\n\n880\n00:45:16.250 --> 00:45:18.100\nAnd you'll see that throughout here,\nright?\n\n881\n00:45:18.100 --> 00:45:19.110\nMy next entry here.\n\n882\n00:45:20.160 --> 00:45:21.820\nTitle CentOS.\n\n883\n00:45:21.820 --> 00:45:23.180\nThat's my operating system.\n\n884\n00:45:23.180 --> 00:45:25.928\nThis is a menu entry right here.\n\n885\n00:45:25.928 --> 00:45:30.573\nAnd in that menu entry I can see\nthat it's referencing CentOS and\n\n886\n00:45:30.573 --> 00:45:34.193\nthe root for\nthat operating system is hd d0,0.\n\n887\n00:45:34.193 --> 00:45:37.313\nThat's the location on the drive\nwhere to find this one, all right.\n\n888\n00:45:37.313 --> 00:45:40.877\nSo it was the first operating system\nI installed in this drive and\n\n889\n00:45:40.877 --> 00:45:43.675\nit's right there at the beginning.\n\n890\n00:45:43.675 --> 00:45:45.545\nI'll see the kernel that we're gonna boot.\n\n891\n00:45:45.545 --> 00:45:49.900\nSo there points to the vm or\nhowever you say that.\n\n892\n00:45:49.900 --> 00:45:53.660\nSo there's the actually colonel and\nall the kernel options associated with it.\n\n893\n00:45:53.660 --> 00:45:57.635\nSee all this stuff here, that's\nactually one big word wrapping line.\n\n894\n00:45:57.635 --> 00:46:00.590\n[LAUGH] It's just going around and\naround and around.\n\n895\n00:46:00.590 --> 00:46:05.370\nAnd that's the kernel options, you'll see\nit specifying what keyboard layout to use,\n\n896\n00:46:05.370 --> 00:46:06.120\nand so on.\n\n897\n00:46:06.120 --> 00:46:09.756\nAnd these are options that you may have\nto manipulate, but most people don't.\n\n898\n00:46:09.756 --> 00:46:14.330\n[COUGH] It's talking about the\ninitialization for the configuration, so\n\n899\n00:46:14.330 --> 00:46:16.490\nwhere it's gonna get\nthe original config files.\n\n900\n00:46:16.490 --> 00:46:19.440\nSo it's actually creating a little\nRAM drive, init, RAM drive.\n\n901\n00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:19.960\n>> Yeah.\n>> And\n\n902\n00:46:19.960 --> 00:46:21.430\nloading some of the configs into that.\n\n903\n00:46:21.430 --> 00:46:24.120\nSo that's what this image\nis that it's loading.\n\n904\n00:46:24.120 --> 00:46:27.750\nAnd then I've got a second\nentry here called CentOS, and\n\n905\n00:46:27.750 --> 00:46:33.840\nwhat this one is is I updated my\nkernel and so I have two kernels now.\n\n906\n00:46:33.840 --> 00:46:36.000\nThe new one up here.\n\n907\n00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:39.620\nBut if something goes wrong,\nI can still specify the old one.\n\n908\n00:46:39.620 --> 00:46:43.150\nWhenever you update your kernels, CentOS,\nwe'll keep a second entry in your menu for\n\n909\n00:46:43.150 --> 00:46:43.840\nthat other one.\n\n910\n00:46:43.840 --> 00:46:45.200\n>> Nice.\n>> So that you can go to it.\n\n911\n00:46:45.200 --> 00:46:47.428\nAnd a lot of times,\nit'll label this one as safe boot.\n\n912\n00:46:47.428 --> 00:46:50.308\nAnd the reason they call it safe\nis notice how there's no options.\n\n913\n00:46:50.308 --> 00:46:55.810\nBasically boot this kernel without\nany special options or alterations.\n\n914\n00:46:55.810 --> 00:46:59.600\nJust give it a boot and\ndon't mess around with what's in there.\n\n915\n00:46:59.600 --> 00:47:02.198\nSo you may see it like that, all right.\n\n916\n00:47:02.198 --> 00:47:05.986\nActually if I scroll down there\nare options tied to this one.\n\n917\n00:47:05.986 --> 00:47:09.210\nSo yeah, in this case it's just\npointing to that older kernel.\n\n918\n00:47:10.500 --> 00:47:12.100\nAnd we can add entries to this.\n\n919\n00:47:12.100 --> 00:47:15.310\nIf you have other OSes that are out there,\nif you wanna kinda mess around with it,\n\n920\n00:47:15.310 --> 00:47:17.860\nmaybe I upgraded from\na previous version of Linux.\n\n921\n00:47:17.860 --> 00:47:23.323\nSo I might come in here and\nadd title CentOS 5.6, right?\n\n922\n00:47:23.323 --> 00:47:27.740\nSo I still have my old CentOS 5.6 on here,\nmaybe in a different location.\n\n923\n00:47:27.740 --> 00:47:30.546\nAnd so I wanna type that in and\ntell it where to find it.\n\n924\n00:47:30.546 --> 00:47:33.764\nMaybe I saved it, but\nI saved it on a different hard drive.\n\n925\n00:47:33.764 --> 00:47:38.334\nSo I could say root hd1,0.\n\n926\n00:47:38.334 --> 00:47:41.544\nIt's not on the first hard drive,\nthis is on the second hard drive.\n\n927\n00:47:41.544 --> 00:47:42.996\nAnd then I could tell that it's kernel and\n\n928\n00:47:42.996 --> 00:47:45.418\nI'm gonna be lazy, there's no way\nI'm typing out a ton of options.\n\n929\n00:47:45.418 --> 00:47:48.506\n>> [LAUGH] But\nI could specify where to go and\n\n930\n00:47:48.506 --> 00:47:52.520\nfind that based on\nwherever it happens to be.\n\n931\n00:47:52.520 --> 00:47:55.576\nAnd like I said,\nI'm just gonna stop right there.\n\n932\n00:47:55.576 --> 00:47:57.940\nThere's no point in me typing\nup the whole crazy thing.\n\n933\n00:47:57.940 --> 00:48:02.110\nBut one thing that I might have\nto do is when I say /boot,\n\n934\n00:48:02.110 --> 00:48:03.790\nit doesn't know where /boot is.\n\n935\n00:48:03.790 --> 00:48:10.660\nSo I'll probably have to follow\nthis up with a root=/dev/sdb1,\n\n936\n00:48:10.660 --> 00:48:12.590\ntelling it where to go to find that root.\n\n937\n00:48:12.590 --> 00:48:17.240\nSo I'll have to give it some guidance,\nit depends on your system where this\n\n938\n00:48:19.050 --> 00:48:20.920\nis going to be.\n\n939\n00:48:20.920 --> 00:48:25.930\nI will need to specify the initrd and\nthe same basic thing here,\n\n940\n00:48:25.930 --> 00:48:32.760\nI'm going to point it to a file somewhere\nand I'll just stop right there.\n\n941\n00:48:32.760 --> 00:48:36.290\nAnd specify that so that it knows\nwhere to get that information to.\n\n942\n00:48:37.830 --> 00:48:40.549\nSo that would add another\nCentOS entry to it.\n\n943\n00:48:40.549 --> 00:48:42.520\nWhat if I wanted to boot Windows?\n\n944\n00:48:42.520 --> 00:48:44.900\nWhat if I had Windows\non a third hard drive?\n\n945\n00:48:44.900 --> 00:48:47.675\nOkay, Windows is a little weird because\nit has it's own boot loader and\n\n946\n00:48:47.675 --> 00:48:49.582\nit does not support\nthird-party boot loaders.\n\n947\n00:48:49.582 --> 00:48:51.190\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It won't do it, right?\n\n948\n00:48:51.190 --> 00:48:53.590\nSo Windows does not support GRUB.\n\n949\n00:48:53.590 --> 00:48:57.010\nBut GRUB supports chain\nloading boot loaders.\n\n950\n00:48:57.010 --> 00:48:59.640\nSo, this boot loader could\ncall another boot loader.\n\n951\n00:48:59.640 --> 00:49:02.980\nSo, what we could do is we\ncan say title Windows 7.\n\n952\n00:49:02.980 --> 00:49:06.720\nSo, maybe I got Windows 7 tucked\naway on my system somewhere.\n\n953\n00:49:06.720 --> 00:49:12.040\nAnd I can say rootnoverify cuz we won't\nbe able to verify the root location,\n\n954\n00:49:12.040 --> 00:49:13.648\nit's not a Linux system.\n\n955\n00:49:13.648 --> 00:49:18.550\nAnd then, (hd2,0), so\nthis would be hard drive three.\n\n956\n00:49:19.890 --> 00:49:24.210\nAll right, and then we can say makeactive,\nwe have to force it active because again,\n\n957\n00:49:24.210 --> 00:49:26.590\nit's not gonna show up as\na normal Linux system.\n\n958\n00:49:26.590 --> 00:49:30.120\nAnd then we can say chainloader +1.\n\n959\n00:49:30.120 --> 00:49:34.050\nOkay, we're gonna call that drive and\n\n960\n00:49:34.050 --> 00:49:38.250\nthere's going to be one more boot loader\nthat we need to call after this one.\n\n961\n00:49:38.250 --> 00:49:41.230\nSo our boot loader is\ngoing to call one more, so\n\n962\n00:49:41.230 --> 00:49:43.670\nthat'll add a Windows system to GRUB.\n\n963\n00:49:43.670 --> 00:49:46.712\nAnd so now when we boot up we\ncan still call the Windows\n\n964\n00:49:46.712 --> 00:49:50.811\n7 boot loader on that third hard drive and\nboot it up and go from there.\n\n965\n00:49:50.811 --> 00:49:55.950\nSo, I'm gonna save that file, and\nnow it's saved, it's in place.\n\n966\n00:49:55.950 --> 00:49:57.920\nWe're pretty much ready to rock, right?\n\n967\n00:49:57.920 --> 00:50:00.230\nI can reboot and\nnow my menu should be updated.\n\n968\n00:50:00.230 --> 00:50:03.690\nNow, what if Grub had gotten corrupted or\ndamaged?\n\n969\n00:50:03.690 --> 00:50:04.512\nThat does happen, right?\n\n970\n00:50:04.512 --> 00:50:05.170\n>> Yeah.\n\n971\n00:50:05.170 --> 00:50:08.310\n>> So, if it had gotten corrupted or\ndamaged, we might need to reinstall it.\n\n972\n00:50:08.310 --> 00:50:13.210\nOr if we were running GRUB Legacy and\nwe want to move to GRUB 2, right?\n\n973\n00:50:13.210 --> 00:50:17.099\nWell I just updated all\nthe GRUB 2 files right there so\n\n974\n00:50:17.099 --> 00:50:21.777\nI would just follow this up\nwith the grub-install/dev/sda.\n\n975\n00:50:21.777 --> 00:50:26.741\nThat's gonna tell it to install GRUB into\nthe master boot record of hard drive A,\n\n976\n00:50:26.741 --> 00:50:28.494\nSDA, the first hard drive.\n\n977\n00:50:28.494 --> 00:50:31.515\nIf that's not my booted drive,\nif I've gone in BIOS and I'm telling\n\n978\n00:50:31.515 --> 00:50:34.775\nit to boot from drive B, then I would\njust need to move that to B, right?\n\n979\n00:50:34.775 --> 00:50:37.325\nSo you adjust that however you want,\nall right?\n\n980\n00:50:37.325 --> 00:50:40.240\nAnd then that'll reinstall GRUB and\nget it in place.\n\n981\n00:50:40.240 --> 00:50:42.200\nBut if you're just making changes\nyou don't need to do that,\n\n982\n00:50:42.200 --> 00:50:45.010\nit'll pick up the changes on it's own,\nthat's kinda what it does.\n\n983\n00:50:45.010 --> 00:50:47.880\nSo I should just be able to reboot, and\n\n984\n00:50:47.880 --> 00:50:51.920\nwhen it reboots, I should see my menu\nwith a couple extra options in it.\n\n985\n00:50:51.920 --> 00:50:53.950\nOptions that won't work,\ncuz those OS's aren't there, and\n\n986\n00:50:53.950 --> 00:50:56.285\nI was too lazy to type\nthem all the way out.\n\n987\n00:50:56.285 --> 00:51:01.040\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But we should see it, there we go.\n\n988\n00:51:01.040 --> 00:51:03.758\nAnd you know,\nI didn't mention that hidden menu option.\n\n989\n00:51:03.758 --> 00:51:05.710\n>> Yeah.\n>> The hidden menu option is what\n\n990\n00:51:05.710 --> 00:51:09.290\nmade it say press any key to get\na menu there, and so I just hit it.\n\n991\n00:51:09.290 --> 00:51:12.650\nIf I had taken a hidden menu out,\nit would have taken me right to this.\n\n992\n00:51:12.650 --> 00:51:15.690\nAnd so here I can see the two\nCentOS zones that were created, and\n\n993\n00:51:15.690 --> 00:51:18.910\nthey're CentOS 5.6 and Windows 7,\nthose are the ones that I made.\n\n994\n00:51:18.910 --> 00:51:20.925\nAnd they're not going to\nwork cuz those drives don't\n\n995\n00:51:20.925 --> 00:51:21.600\nexist so say I-\n>> Yeah.\n\n996\n00:51:21.600 --> 00:51:24.270\n>> Get an invalid or\nunsupported executable format.\n\n997\n00:51:24.270 --> 00:51:25.610\nIt couldn't find that drive.\n\n998\n00:51:25.610 --> 00:51:28.990\nSo, that's what that is, all right?\n\n999\n00:51:28.990 --> 00:51:30.500\nSo, GRUB's really not that bad.\n\n1000\n00:51:30.500 --> 00:51:34.300\nThe commands are really long, as far as\nreferencing the kernel and the options,\n\n1001\n00:51:34.300 --> 00:51:36.180\nand stuff, but that is basically it.\n\n1002\n00:51:37.860 --> 00:51:40.368\nAll right, I think that's all I've\ngot on GRUB and the file layout.\n\n1003\n00:51:40.368 --> 00:51:42.180\n>> Yeah, sounds good.\n\n1004\n00:51:42.180 --> 00:51:44.757\n>> We have a lot more file system-\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1005\n00:51:44.757 --> 00:51:45.299\n>> Stuff.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1006\n00:51:45.299 --> 00:51:47.451\n>> To get to and we're gonna do that,\n\n1007\n00:51:47.451 --> 00:51:49.120\nthis was kind of part two.\n\n1008\n00:51:49.120 --> 00:51:50.700\nWe're gonna do a part three.\n\n1009\n00:51:50.700 --> 00:51:52.479\nI actually have to go to\na dentist appointment.\n\n1010\n00:51:52.479 --> 00:51:55.080\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] So I'm gonna dash out for that.\n\n1011\n00:51:55.080 --> 00:51:57.470\nIf you're watching live,\nwe'll be back right after lunch.\n\n1012\n00:51:57.470 --> 00:52:00.000\nIf you're watching this recorded,\nthen it's just the next episode.\n\n1013\n00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:03.480\nWe're going to take a look at how to tune\nthe file system, and keep it healthy.\n\n1014\n00:52:03.480 --> 00:52:06.180\nHow to check it for errors,\na lot of good stuff like that.\n\n1015\n00:52:06.180 --> 00:52:10.358\nSo, definitely stay tuned for\nthat episode and we'll see you then.\n\n1016\n00:52:10.358 --> 00:52:15.159\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

ITproTV,\n\n7\n00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.660\nI'm your host magnum PI today with mister\nRonnie Wong, how's it going Ronnie?\n\n8\n00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:43.990\n>> I am very excited today.\n\n9\n00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:46.370\nI just read an article on the internet.\n\n10\n00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.000\n>> So it must be true.\n\n11\n00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.240\n>> So it must be true.\n\n12\n00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.195\nIt says saved by the bell whole movie,\n\n13\n00:00:51.195 --> 00:00:56.045\nto offer a behind the looks expose\non the tv yet that's unauthorized.\n\n14\n00:00:56.045 --> 00:00:59.075\nSo those stars will not\nbe appearing in the.\n\n15\n00:01:00.405 --> 00:01:03.255\n>> We need to start doing unauthorized\ncoverage of all sorts of things,\n\n16\n00:01:03.255 --> 00:01:04.530\nbecause you can just\nmake it up at that point.\n\n17\n00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:05.600\nOne my God's not true.\n\n18\n00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:06.430\nBut it wasn't authorized.\n\n19\n00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:07.220\nIt doesn't matter.\n\n20\n00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:08.106\n>> Saved by the bell.\n\n21\n00:01:08.106 --> 00:01:09.182\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Movie.\n\n22\n00:01:09.182 --> 00:01:11.800\n>> Sad [INAUDIBLE] guys are still alive.\n\n23\n00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.320\nAll right.\nWell as exciting as early 90's\n\n24\n00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.160\nchildren has comes to work.\n\n25\n00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.560\nWe're gonna be jumping\nback in the Linux+ today,\n\n26\n00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.790\nwe are I guess we're now in\npart three of disk management.\n\n27\n00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:27.300\nBut managing our disks,\nkind of an important thing.\n\n28\n00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:31.550\nWe have seen a lot of command line\nutilities for interacting with our disks,\n\n29\n00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:35.660\nand last episode we saw how\nto set up mount points and\n\n30\n00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.420\nkind of take a look at how our disk\nis arranged, where our files end up.\n\n31\n00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.270\nSo today we're gonna expand upon that\nin the final, I shouldn't say final, or\n\n32\n00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:44.152\nwe end up going to a part four.\n\n33\n00:01:44.152 --> 00:01:45.154\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But\n\n34\n00:01:45.154 --> 00:01:48.749\nwhat should be our final\nchapter on disk management.\n\n35\n00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:49.910\nI do wanna double back a bit.\n\n36\n00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:54.180\nWe have used several commands\nin previous episodes, and\n\n37\n00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.660\nsome of them I showed just\nto make a certain point.\n\n38\n00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:58.060\nAt the time, but\n\n39\n00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.567\nI want to cover them again here\nrepetition leads to retention, right.\n\n40\n00:02:01.567 --> 00:02:03.160\nSo we learn and memorize.\n\n41\n00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:04.650\nSo I don't mind it so much.\n\n42\n00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:07.600\nBut some of these commands you might\nhave all ready seen in other episodes,\n\n43\n00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.740\nso just be aware of that, all right.\n\n44\n00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:12.460\nOne of those commands I'm\ngonna lead right off with.\n\n45\n00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:15.980\nWhen it comes to managing discs,\nthe number one command for\n\n46\n00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.820\nme is, I wanna see how much free\nspace I have on my discs and\n\n47\n00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.380\nthe DF command is our winner for\nthat, right.\n\n48\n00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.850\nLet me fire that up here as an example,\nand I don't normally just run df cuz it\n\n49\n00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:34.000\nshows all the values in bytes, I usually\ndo df-h, and that will put it in a human,\n\n50\n00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.610\nreadable format that will show kilobytes,\nmegabytes, gigabytes,\n\n51\n00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:41.030\njust kinda makes it a little easier\nto read, so I normally do df-h.\n\n52\n00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:42.360\nAll right.\n\n53\n00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.590\nNow when I look at my output here,\nI can see for\n\n54\n00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.240\nexample, my lv_root, the logical volume.\n\n55\n00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:50.180\nIt is my root drive.\n\n56\n00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.650\nIt is right there, it's 18 gigs in size.\n\n57\n00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.650\nI'm using about 3 gigs of that, and\nso it's 18% utilized right now.\n\n58\n00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.560\nAnd I can see my temp file system and\nthe drive itself, and\n\n59\n00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.550\nkind of measure\nthe utilization of the disks.\n\n60\n00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:06.940\nSo that information is there.\n\n61\n00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:07.490\nI can see it.\n\n62\n00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:09.090\nIt's easy to interpret.\n\n63\n00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.280\nNow you'll remember a few episodes ago,\n\n64\n00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.690\nI actually ran my system\nout of hard drive space.\n\n65\n00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.370\nI was using the disk duplicate or\nthe DD or data duplicator.\n\n66\n00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:20.090\nAnd I was backing up a disk that was\nlarger than where I was storing it and\n\n67\n00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:21.380\nI ran out of hard drive space.\n\n68\n00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:26.550\nNow I knew what the problem was cuz well\nI did it, but [LAUGH] it was my fault.\n\n69\n00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:30.360\nBut what if you came\nup to a hard drive and\n\n70\n00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:34.430\nyou didn't know what was\neating up all of that space.\n\n71\n00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.050\nWell this doesn't tell you that.\n\n72\n00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:37.480\nDF gives you the overall numbers.\n\n73\n00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.960\nIt doesn't tell you where that\nconsumption is coming from, all right.\n\n74\n00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:44.200\nSo there's another utility that\nkind of goes along with this.\n\n75\n00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.430\nThat doesn't show us the disk\nspace of our whole drive.\n\n76\n00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.340\nI guess it can, but it doesn't by default.\n\n77\n00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.510\nBut instead will show us the disk size\nof files or folders that we request.\n\n78\n00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:56.310\nAnd it's nice because we\ncan use this to figure out\n\n79\n00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.600\nwhere our space is being consumed.\n\n80\n00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:59.200\nOkay.\n\n81\n00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.880\nSo when I look at a folder,\nlike if I just do an LS on this folder,\n\n82\n00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:08.210\nI can see all the stuff that I've got\ntucked away here in my home directory.\n\n83\n00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:10.780\nI'm logged in as root, so\nit's in my root directory right now.\n\n84\n00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:15.320\nAnd I can see them, ls-la will show\nme the size of all that stuff.\n\n85\n00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:18.330\nSo I can see the size of\neach file individually.\n\n86\n00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:21.040\nNow what I don't get is\na nice little summary,\n\n87\n00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.800\nit doesn't tell me how much\nall these files are together.\n\n88\n00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.200\nAnd it also doesn't tell me about\nmy subdirectories and those guys.\n\n89\n00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:30.130\nBut the du command will.\n\n90\n00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:31.640\nSo df is like disk free.\n\n91\n00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:33.720\nSo it shows us the free space on the disk.\n\n92\n00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.320\nDu shows us disk utilization.\n\n93\n00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.520\nNow if you run du by itself,\n\n94\n00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:43.110\nwell it shows something that\nreally isn't terribly useful.\n\n95\n00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:44.580\nThe data scrolls by really fast.\n\n96\n00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:47.740\nIt's every file in your folder and\n\n97\n00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:52.700\nsubdirectory from your current location,\nwith the file size to the left of it.\n\n98\n00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:57.160\nAnd you get a nice little list, but\neven this doesn't have a total.\n\n99\n00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.330\nI know it kinda looks like it does,\nbut it doesn't.\n\n100\n00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:04.430\nSo I don't get a great set of data\nout of du by itself, all right.\n\n101\n00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:07.670\nI normally combine it with a couple\nof command line options and\n\n102\n00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:09.460\na little bit of targeting, all right.\n\n103\n00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:12.760\nSo the way I normally run it is du-chs.\n\n104\n00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:16.340\nThese are my three favorite options.\n\n105\n00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:19.600\nC means to give me a total.\n\n106\n00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:24.070\nAdd up all of the files and\nlet me know what the total is.\n\n107\n00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:27.140\nH says use human readable numbers.\n\n108\n00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:28.560\nSo don't give them to me in bytes.\n\n109\n00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.958\nGive them to me in megs or\ngigs or whatever.\n\n110\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:34.984\nAnd if I run it like that, now I get\nthe same basic pay, except the numbers\n\n111\n00:05:34.984 --> 00:05:39.406\nare a little bit more easier to read and\nI get that total down there at the bottom,\n\n112\n00:05:39.406 --> 00:05:42.260\nand I guess I was getting\nan accurate total before.\n\n113\n00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:46.780\nSo 298 megabytes here in my folder alone,\nokay.\n\n114\n00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:50.650\nWe can combine that with S, and\nthis is what I normally do.\n\n115\n00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:54.460\nI'm not normally so concerned about\nthe size of individual files,\n\n116\n00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:57.080\nI'm more concerned about\nthe size in general.\n\n117\n00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:00.960\nAnd so if you run du-chs,\nyou can run it and\n\n118\n00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:04.700\nit just gives you the total, instead\nof that big rattling list of files.\n\n119\n00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:09.230\nSo I can see that my folder that I'm\ncurrently in is 298 megs, right.\n\n120\n00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:12.010\nAnd you can point it anywhere.\n\n121\n00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:14.240\nI can say look at /home, right.\n\n122\n00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:18.220\nTake a look at /home and\ntotal up all the sub-directories and\n\n123\n00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:24.180\ntell me how big that particular folder\nis and it lets me know it's 239 megs.\n\n124\n00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:27.380\nOr I could point it at sbin, right.\n\n125\n00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:29.990\nAnd I can see it's only 15 megs.\n\n126\n00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:33.340\nSo you can start pointing at\ndifferent locations at your drive and\n\n127\n00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:35.140\nfinding out how big those folders are.\n\n128\n00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:38.990\nThat's really useful to be able to find\nout where your space is being eaten up.\n\n129\n00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:46.224\nSo if we combine that with df, we can get\na good idea of where our storage is going.\n\n130\n00:06:47.868 --> 00:06:51.036\nAll right,\nnow normally we format our disks,\n\n131\n00:06:51.036 --> 00:06:54.620\nwe mount them to a mount point,\nand then we use them.\n\n132\n00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:58.960\nAnd as long as you don't run out of space,\nthere's not much else we have to do, okay.\n\n133\n00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:01.900\nWell formatting them,\nwe saw that the other day, right.\n\n134\n00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:05.840\nWe used the mkfs utility\nto format the disk and\n\n135\n00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:09.261\nmkfs is actually a utility by itself but\n\n136\n00:07:09.261 --> 00:07:13.628\nit's really just a wrapper for\nother utilities.\n\n137\n00:07:13.628 --> 00:07:18.203\nAnd so we normally combine it\nwith other things like mkfs.ext2.\n\n138\n00:07:18.203 --> 00:07:24.750\nThat means I'm gonna format a drive\nusing the ext2 file system.\n\n139\n00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:27.278\nOr three or four, right.\n\n140\n00:07:27.278 --> 00:07:33.350\nOr I'm gonna format it as fat16, right or\nwhatever it is we want to format as.\n\n141\n00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:34.490\nWe specify that.\n\n142\n00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:37.680\nAnd so we saw that in another episode.\n\n143\n00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:40.460\nWhen we formatted that other\ndrive in the other episode,\n\n144\n00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:43.070\nwhen we did that it told us something.\n\n145\n00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:48.048\nIt said by the way,\nwe're gonna check your disk for errors.\n\n146\n00:07:48.048 --> 00:07:55.090\nAnd were gonna check it either every\n180 mounts or every six months.\n\n147\n00:07:55.090 --> 00:07:56.640\nWhich ever comes first.\n\n148\n00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:59.550\nOkay.\nSo every time you reboot you remount\n\n149\n00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:00.168\na disk.\n\n150\n00:08:00.168 --> 00:08:04.488\nAnd so it's basically saying\nevery 180 reboots or six months.\n\n151\n00:08:04.488 --> 00:08:05.949\nWhichever comes first, right?\n\n152\n00:08:05.949 --> 00:08:08.075\nI think it was 180 that was the default,\nI could be wrong,\n\n153\n00:08:08.075 --> 00:08:09.212\nit might be a different number.\n\n154\n00:08:09.212 --> 00:08:13.070\nBut, it was basically saying it would\ndo it at some kinda interval, right?\n\n155\n00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:15.210\nWell, what if we don't wanna wait for\nthe interval?\n\n156\n00:08:15.210 --> 00:08:18.730\nWhat if we wanna scan a disk for\nerrors right now?\n\n157\n00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:21.170\nI'm seeing some odd\nbehavior out of a disk and\n\n158\n00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:23.560\nI wanna figure out what's going on, okay?\n\n159\n00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:27.510\nBut we can force that disk\ncheck whenever we want using\n\n160\n00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:34.720\nthe F-S-C-K utility and that's\nthe file system check utility, right?\n\n161\n00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:38.900\nWhen it said hey, I'm gonna check your\ndisk every six months, it just meant that\n\n162\n00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:42.240\nif six months goes by and we haven't\nchecked, the next time you reboot,\n\n163\n00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:47.820\nwhen you boot, it will run FSCK and\nit will check your disk, right?\n\n164\n00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:50.780\nNow, FSCK was designed for EXT two.\n\n165\n00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:52.230\nIt's been around a long time.\n\n166\n00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:56.650\nBut, we can use it to scan other file\nsystems too, it's really flexible.\n\n167\n00:08:56.650 --> 00:08:59.260\nIn fact,\nwhat it normally does when you run it,\n\n168\n00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:03.480\nit looks at your file system table,\nyour fstab file, and\n\n169\n00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:07.550\nit looks in there and\ntells you what file system everything is.\n\n170\n00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:14.442\nRemember, that fstab file,\nif we do more slash /etc/fstab, all right.\n\n171\n00:09:14.442 --> 00:09:16.350\nThere's my file systems.\n\n172\n00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:19.570\nAnd it shows in there what\neach one is formatted, so\n\n173\n00:09:19.570 --> 00:09:24.132\nI can see like ext4 or swap temfs,\n\n174\n00:09:24.132 --> 00:09:29.980\ndevpts, sysfs, proc, each of these\nare different file systems and\n\n175\n00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:34.470\nFSCK knows whether or not it can check\nthese and what it can work with.\n\n176\n00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:38.360\nAlso remember when we look at this,\nthese last two numbers.\n\n177\n00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:40.600\nThe first one is saying whether or\nnot we back the drive up, but\n\n178\n00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:43.750\nthe second one is saying whether\nwe should check it for errors.\n\n179\n00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:48.520\nSo if I run fsck, I can point it\nright at my boot drive here, and\n\n180\n00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:49.750\nit's gonna scan it.\n\n181\n00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:54.180\nOr I could point it at this other, I'm\nsorry, my root drive, or my boot drive,\n\n182\n00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:55.290\nand it's gonna scan it.\n\n183\n00:09:55.290 --> 00:09:58.780\nBut, if I point it at my swap or\nthe shm, or any of these other places,\n\n184\n00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:03.558\nif not in a scan mode,\nbecause they have that 0 at the end.\n\n185\n00:10:03.558 --> 00:10:08.380\nIf you wanna check all of your disks,\nthe easiest way to use fsck is\n\n186\n00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:12.510\njust to run fsck dash and a capital a.\n\n187\n00:10:12.510 --> 00:10:15.000\nThat capital a says check\nall my file systems.\n\n188\n00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.030\nJust read f stab and whatever it says can\nbe checked, just go ahead and check it.\n\n189\n00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:20.970\nSo, if you're just doing\nroutine maintenance,\n\n190\n00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:25.180\nif you're doing a scheduled job to do\nthe scan once a month or whatever, that's\n\n191\n00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:29.930\nusually the command that we run, and we\ndon't worry too much more about it, right?\n\n192\n00:10:29.930 --> 00:10:33.910\nBut we can do a lot more if we want,\nso for example,\n\n193\n00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:38.800\nI could say fsck dash\nt to specify what type\n\n194\n00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:44.850\nof disk I'm scanning and then I could\npoint to where that disk is mounted.\n\n195\n00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:47.610\nI'm sorry, not where it's mounted,\nI gotta point to the partition.\n\n196\n00:10:47.610 --> 00:10:51.151\nSo, we'd have to say\n/dev/mapper/VolGroup-lv_root.\n\n197\n00:10:51.151 --> 00:10:56.376\nIf I wanna scan my root mount point,\n\n198\n00:10:56.376 --> 00:11:00.040\nthen I can scan that way.\n\n199\n00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:06.250\nIf I didn't use the lvm, then I would\npoint to /dev, /sda1 or wherever it was.\n\n200\n00:11:06.250 --> 00:11:10.890\nSo I'm gonna do this scan here, saying\nit's the xt4, and go ahead and scan it.\n\n201\n00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:14.520\nNow, it probably would have figured out\nthat it was the xt4 on it's own, and\n\n202\n00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:17.850\nif we'd done fsck-a it\ndefinitely would have.\n\n203\n00:11:17.850 --> 00:11:20.780\nBut, this will just basically\nreach out there and run a scan.\n\n204\n00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:23.950\nNow, it's gonna give me a warning\nhere saying it's mounted.\n\n205\n00:11:23.950 --> 00:11:26.470\nYou can't scan a disk that's mounted,\n\n206\n00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:29.250\nbecause it's in use by\nthe operating system.\n\n207\n00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:32.570\nThat's why these scans\nnormally happen at boot time.\n\n208\n00:11:32.570 --> 00:11:36.220\nThat's why we have that whole\nautomated system in place.\n\n209\n00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:40.430\nBut if we had a disk that we had\ncreated after the fact and mounted.\n\n210\n00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:42.020\nThen we could run this.\n\n211\n00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:48.609\nIn fact, do I still have,\ndon't I have sdb?\n\n212\n00:11:48.609 --> 00:11:54.735\nYeah, so I've got sdb and\nit looks like I got a partition on it.\n\n213\n00:11:54.735 --> 00:11:56.680\nLet me just make sure that I do.\n\n214\n00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:00.850\nYes, so it's got a Linux partition on it.\n\n215\n00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:05.651\nAnd, I'll just format it real quick.\n\n216\n00:12:09.985 --> 00:12:15.390\nSo, I'm just gonna format it, I'm using\nmkfs.ext4 to format it as a ext4 disk.\n\n217\n00:12:16.402 --> 00:12:20.260\nAnd then, I think I mounted as\nvideos the other day, right?\n\n218\n00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:21.777\nIt's still there, good.\n\n219\n00:12:21.777 --> 00:12:27.580\nSo, now I'm just gonna\nmount that to videos and\n\n220\n00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:31.942\nnow, I can go in and start to use it.\n\n221\n00:12:31.942 --> 00:12:37.307\nIf I try to scan it, so\nI'm just gonna try and\n\n222\n00:12:37.307 --> 00:12:40.942\nscan /dev/sdb1, right?\n\n223\n00:12:40.942 --> 00:12:43.744\nIt's gonna give me that same warning,\nhey it's mounted,\n\n224\n00:12:43.744 --> 00:12:45.660\nI can't do anything about it.\n\n225\n00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:52.260\nBut if I unmount it, right, now I can\nscan it for errors and there it goes.\n\n226\n00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:55.930\nIt scanned it, returned that it was\nclean and we're in business, right?\n\n227\n00:12:55.930 --> 00:12:59.130\nAnd now, I can just mount it\nback again and off we go.\n\n228\n00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:03.130\nBut, what about that root file system?\n\n229\n00:13:03.130 --> 00:13:06.500\nThat root file system, I wanna scan it,\nbut that's a little bit more challenging\n\n230\n00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:08.820\nbecause it's pretty much always\ngonna be mounted, right?\n\n231\n00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:11.397\nI could boot up off of a live CD or\nwhatever and\n\n232\n00:13:11.397 --> 00:13:15.231\nrun the scan there while the volume\nwas offline, but when you boot\n\n233\n00:13:15.231 --> 00:13:19.831\nup the automated checks, what they do\nis they make the system read-only, and\n\n234\n00:13:19.831 --> 00:13:23.693\nthen they do their check and\nthen they make it read-write again.\n\n235\n00:13:23.693 --> 00:13:26.589\nSo, there's ways around it,\nnow I don't normally force it,\n\n236\n00:13:26.589 --> 00:13:29.260\nwhat I normally do is mess\nwith the drive tuning.\n\n237\n00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:33.580\nWe can adjust the interval at which\nit's going to do the scan, and\n\n238\n00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:38.880\nwe can kinda force it to do scans\nearlier or later, based on that, right?\n\n239\n00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:41.500\nThe way we do that is\nkinda a little weird.\n\n240\n00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:44.610\nWe actually have a neat\ncommand called tunefs.\n\n241\n00:13:44.610 --> 00:13:48.180\nActually it's tune, E2, yeah.\n\n242\n00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:52.765\nSo, it's supposed to be like Tune e2fs for\nthe ext2, but\n\n243\n00:13:52.765 --> 00:13:57.902\ntune 2fs, and that one lets us kinda\nmakes some tweaks to the drive\n\n244\n00:13:57.902 --> 00:14:02.692\nincluding when's the next time\nthat we're going to scan it.\n\n245\n00:14:02.692 --> 00:14:04.024\nAnd we can set this very low, so\n\n246\n00:14:04.024 --> 00:14:06.540\nthat it will scan the next\ntime we boot if we want.\n\n247\n00:14:06.540 --> 00:14:09.480\nOr we can set to longer or\nwhatever it is that we need.\n\n248\n00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:14.230\nThere's actually a lot of different\nsetting in tune2fs that let's us do\n\n249\n00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:18.368\nsome crazy things, but\nthe normal things that we are looking for\n\n250\n00:14:18.368 --> 00:14:20.897\nare how many mounts between scans, and\n\n251\n00:14:20.897 --> 00:14:25.365\nhow much time between scans before\nwe do something about it, right?\n\n252\n00:14:25.365 --> 00:14:31.700\nSo for example, let's say I want\nit to scan every ten mounts.\n\n253\n00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:35.568\nSo every ten reboots, I want it to\nscan just to make sure that it's fine.\n\n254\n00:14:35.568 --> 00:14:36.444\nOr every three months, okay?\n\n255\n00:14:36.444 --> 00:14:42.540\nSo, every three months, I wanna go\nahead and just to be on the safe side.\n\n256\n00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:49.484\nThen what I can do is I can say\ntune2fs/div/ I'll do stb1, all right?\n\n257\n00:14:49.484 --> 00:14:52.299\nSo, I'm telling it what\ndrive I wanna manipulate and\n\n258\n00:14:52.299 --> 00:14:56.443\nI'm getting my order back root, I need to\nput my command modifiers in first, right?\n\n259\n00:14:56.443 --> 00:14:59.330\nSo, I'm gonna do dash c for\nthe counts, right?\n\n260\n00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:02.692\nSo, saying every ten mounts,\nI wanna do a scan.\n\n261\n00:15:02.692 --> 00:15:09.240\nAnd I'm gonna say -i for the interval,\nand I'll do 3m for three months.\n\n262\n00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:13.125\nSo, every three months or every ten boots.\n\n263\n00:15:13.125 --> 00:15:18.151\nI want you to go ahead and\nscan /dev/sdb1 for errors, right?\n\n264\n00:15:18.151 --> 00:15:20.122\nNow, if a drive was improperly mounted,\n\n265\n00:15:20.122 --> 00:15:24.170\nthe next time you boot it's gonna scan\nit anyway regardless of this setting.\n\n266\n00:15:24.170 --> 00:15:27.410\nBut if it was properly dismounted\nthen these are the intervals of which\n\n267\n00:15:27.410 --> 00:15:29.420\nit's going to stand, right?\n\n268\n00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:34.190\nAnd so when I run that it's gonna go,\nand there it goes, setting the maximal.\n\n269\n00:15:34.190 --> 00:15:35.760\nIs that even a word?\n\n270\n00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:40.930\nThe maximal amount count to ten,\nand the interval between\n\n271\n00:15:40.930 --> 00:15:44.560\nthem to 7,776,000 seconds which\nI'm assuming is three months.\n\n272\n00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:47.600\nI guess we could fact check that but\nI'll trust it.\n\n273\n00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:48.792\n>> Yeah.\n>> [LAUGH] All right, so\n\n274\n00:15:48.792 --> 00:15:53.444\nthat's something we do have control over,\nwe don't just have to accept the default\n\n275\n00:15:53.444 --> 00:15:57.390\nfrom where we format and mount a disk\nto create it, we can control that.\n\n276\n00:15:57.390 --> 00:15:58.610\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n277\n00:15:58.610 --> 00:16:00.370\n>> All right.\n\n278\n00:16:00.370 --> 00:16:02.070\nNow, tune2fs.\n\n279\n00:16:02.070 --> 00:16:04.390\nIt can do a lot of other things too.\n\n280\n00:16:04.390 --> 00:16:08.065\nThat's usually a one thing I use it for\nbut there other things we can use it for\n\n281\n00:16:08.065 --> 00:16:10.020\nlike changing the volume name.\n\n282\n00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:13.520\nIf we don't like the name that we\ngave a disc when we created it or\n\n283\n00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:15.240\nif you're like me,\nI didn't even give it a name.\n\n284\n00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:17.530\nRight, I just formatted it and\nthat was it.\n\n285\n00:16:17.530 --> 00:16:21.160\nSo you can use tune2fs\nto be able to see that.\n\n286\n00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:27.940\nIf I say tune2fs -l and\nI specify the disk that I'm working with,\n\n287\n00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:33.910\nlike sdb1, -l means list\nthe information about that disk.\n\n288\n00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:37.110\nSo it's gonna give me some nice little\noutput and show me what's up with that\n\n289\n00:16:37.110 --> 00:16:42.420\ndisk and there's quite a bit in here and\n[LAUGH] you can sift through it.\n\n290\n00:16:42.420 --> 00:16:45.000\nLet's see if we can't find it.\n\n291\n00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.050\nSomewhere in here there's an entry that\nsays volume, it's right there at the top,\n\n292\n00:16:48.050 --> 00:16:50.650\nfile system volume name, none.\n\n293\n00:16:50.650 --> 00:16:52.200\nI didn't set a name for it, right?\n\n294\n00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:53.620\nI just created it.\n\n295\n00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:56.340\nBut there's other discs\nlike sda1 that were\n\n296\n00:16:58.380 --> 00:17:01.110\ncreated during the install,\nit doesn't have a name either.\n\n297\n00:17:01.110 --> 00:17:02.135\nWell we are just not.\n\n298\n00:17:02.135 --> 00:17:04.410\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Not naming people.\n\n299\n00:17:04.410 --> 00:17:06.557\nSo they don't have names,\nwe can stick a name on them,\n\n300\n00:17:06.557 --> 00:17:08.578\nmaybe that helps us keep track of them or\nwhatever.\n\n301\n00:17:08.578 --> 00:17:11.911\nYou don't have to have a name obviously,\nbut we can assign one.\n\n302\n00:17:11.911 --> 00:17:16.423\nAnd we do it just by doing tune2fs and\n-l lowercase,\n\n303\n00:17:16.423 --> 00:17:23.160\nthat means list information, -L capital\nmeans change the label, all right?\n\n304\n00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:30.159\nLittle confusing there but so\nI'm gonna say -L to change the label and\n\n305\n00:17:30.159 --> 00:17:35.744\nI'm gonna call this one storage /dev/sdb1,\nokay.\n\n306\n00:17:35.744 --> 00:17:39.348\nSo I'm sticking that label on there and\nit basically reaches into the drive and\n\n307\n00:17:39.348 --> 00:17:40.560\nchanges that disk label.\n\n308\n00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:41.829\nSo now it's got a different volume name.\n\n309\n00:17:45.244 --> 00:17:47.490\nAnd if I go and\npull that information back up.\n\n310\n00:17:47.490 --> 00:17:49.860\nAnd you know what,\nI'm gonna grab this for the word volume.\n\n311\n00:17:51.670 --> 00:17:53.375\nThere, that way I don't\nhave to sift through and\n\n312\n00:17:53.375 --> 00:17:54.970\nfind the [LAUGH] data that I wanted.\n\n313\n00:17:54.970 --> 00:17:58.420\nSo there I go I can see now the file\nsystem volume name is storage, so\n\n314\n00:17:58.420 --> 00:18:02.510\nit's got a name and\nit's happier for it I suppose.\n\n315\n00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:06.390\nAs happy as our file systems get [LAUGH].\n\n316\n00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:10.700\nAll right, so tune2fs there's a lot\nof other neat little things it can do\n\n317\n00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:13.950\nif you pull up the man file for it.\n\n318\n00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:15.203\nLet me just go in here.\n\n319\n00:18:15.203 --> 00:18:20.480\nSo there's the max counts that we adjusted\na minute ago and the mount counts.\n\n320\n00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:24.380\nYou've got error-behavior,\nwhat to do if an error has been detected.\n\n321\n00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:27.510\nYou can tell it to stop messing with\nthe partition and just mount it read-only.\n\n322\n00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:30.380\nAnd that will stop us from\nfurther corrupting the disk, or\n\n323\n00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:33.550\nyou can tell it to continue and\ncontinue scanning and move on.\n\n324\n00:18:33.550 --> 00:18:37.840\nYou can do a lot of other things in here,\nsome of these move beyond my knowledge set\n\n325\n00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:41.880\nas we start getting into things that are\nreally for the hard drive engineers, but\n\n326\n00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:47.130\nyou'll see other things there's\nthe interval that we messified.\n\n327\n00:18:47.130 --> 00:18:47.970\n>> Messified.\n\n328\n00:18:47.970 --> 00:18:49.302\n>> That we messed with earlier.\n\n329\n00:18:49.302 --> 00:18:51.538\n[LAUGH] Don't know where\nthat word came from.\n\n330\n00:18:51.538 --> 00:18:54.860\nBut you'll see a ton of things,\njournaling options, right?\n\n331\n00:18:54.860 --> 00:18:59.850\nIf we're doing a journaling file system\nlike EXT4, we can adjust how big that\n\n332\n00:18:59.850 --> 00:19:02.860\njournal is, what the size is, where\nthe device where it's stored and so on.\n\n333\n00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:05.100\nYou can do all sorts of tweaks there.\n\n334\n00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:07.970\nYour average user has absolutely\nno business messing with that.\n\n335\n00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:12.230\nBut, in a specialized-tuned environment,\nlike if you're running a no-SQL database,\n\n336\n00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:14.680\nmessing with those journal sizes\ncan actually improve performance.\n\n337\n00:19:16.575 --> 00:19:20.985\nSo you got lots of stuff in there for\ntweaking and tuning the file system.\n\n338\n00:19:20.985 --> 00:19:26.345\nFor the exam, I'd probably just remember\ntune2fs -l and then the max count and\n\n339\n00:19:26.345 --> 00:19:31.700\nthe interval values for one or\nchecks those are probably the most common.\n\n340\n00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:33.630\nAll right, what else do we have?\n\n341\n00:19:33.630 --> 00:19:34.680\nYou know what?\n\n342\n00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:39.250\nI wanted to point out\nwhen we format a disk,\n\n343\n00:19:39.250 --> 00:19:43.950\nI mentioned during a show earlier\nthat we use MKFS to format, right?\n\n344\n00:19:43.950 --> 00:19:50.400\nAnd if we take a look at, let's see,\nthat is tucked away under s bin.\n\n345\n00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:54.582\nI always forget where the m cast off is,\nthere it is, under s bin.\n\n346\n00:19:54.582 --> 00:19:59.140\nAll right, see how,\nI mentioned now MKFS is a wrapper, right?\n\n347\n00:19:59.140 --> 00:20:02.570\nAnd I don't mean like Puff Daddy,\nI mean it's more like a candy bar wrapper.\n\n348\n00:20:02.570 --> 00:20:06.060\nAnd it's got entries for\ncram fs, ex two, three, and\n\n349\n00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:09.050\nfour, ex t ext4 develop, msdos, vfat.\n\n350\n00:20:09.050 --> 00:20:13.320\nAnd if we choose, we can install\neven more from our yum repositories,\n\n351\n00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:15.110\nall sorts of different filesystems.\n\n352\n00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:20.910\nWell, these are not the only\nfilesystems that we support, right?\n\n353\n00:20:20.910 --> 00:20:23.310\nLinux supports many, many file systems and\n\n354\n00:20:23.310 --> 00:20:29.010\nmany of them have built in support we\njust can't format using them, right?\n\n355\n00:20:29.010 --> 00:20:32.630\nSo, don't be surprised when you\nlook at something like that\n\n356\n00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:33.890\nfile system table, right?\n\n357\n00:20:33.890 --> 00:20:38.180\nThe fstab file, when you look in there\nyou'll see some weird file systems.\n\n358\n00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:40.270\nYou'll see ext4, we know that one.\n\n359\n00:20:40.270 --> 00:20:47.890\nBut, swap, tmpfs, devpts, sysfs, proc,\nwhat the heck file system are those?\n\n360\n00:20:47.890 --> 00:20:51.860\nThey're very specialized file systems for\na particular function.\n\n361\n00:20:51.860 --> 00:20:56.100\nSo there is no scenario where we'd\nneed to format something with that.\n\n362\n00:20:56.100 --> 00:20:58.860\nSo we just don't have an MKFS command for\nthose.\n\n363\n00:20:58.860 --> 00:21:01.370\nThe operating system takes\ncare of those for us.\n\n364\n00:21:01.370 --> 00:21:04.710\nAll right, so there are more\nthan what we just see in that\n\n365\n00:21:04.710 --> 00:21:06.730\none directory inside of the sbin folder.\n\n366\n00:21:08.790 --> 00:21:14.810\nAll right, so definitely keep that in mind\nthat not everything shows up all the time.\n\n367\n00:21:14.810 --> 00:21:16.200\nAnd then we could add more.\n\n368\n00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:20.490\nThere's plenty of programs\nout there like Fuse, F-U-S-E,\n\n369\n00:21:20.490 --> 00:21:23.800\nthat will add support for\nthings like NTFS.\n\n370\n00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:28.150\nThere's ones that add support for HPFS and\nHPFS+, the ones we use in the Mac world.\n\n371\n00:21:28.150 --> 00:21:30.490\nThere's all sorts of\ndifferent utilities for\n\n372\n00:21:30.490 --> 00:21:33.440\nadding file system functionality in there.\n\n373\n00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:37.830\nZFS has been kinda gaining popularity,\nReiserFS is another one.\n\n374\n00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:40.150\nLet me mention ReiserFS really quick.\n\n375\n00:21:40.150 --> 00:21:42.220\nI know why you're laughing.\n\n376\n00:21:42.220 --> 00:21:45.030\nReiserFS has a little bit\nof a sordid history but\n\n377\n00:21:45.030 --> 00:21:49.680\nit started out as a file system\nthat was a journaling file system.\n\n378\n00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:54.370\nAnd that journaling file system\nthat had been a holy grail of\n\n379\n00:21:54.370 --> 00:21:57.130\nserver file systems for a long time.\n\n380\n00:21:57.130 --> 00:22:01.290\nIn a journaling file system,\nyou don't write directly to a file.\n\n381\n00:22:01.290 --> 00:22:04.410\nInstead you write to a journal or a log.\n\n382\n00:22:04.410 --> 00:22:09.000\nYou write to the log and only when you\nhave 100% written to the log there's\n\n383\n00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:11.050\nthe hard drive then write\nto the actual file.\n\n384\n00:22:11.050 --> 00:22:14.080\nAnd the reason it does that is because\nif there's a power outage while you're\n\n385\n00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:18.910\nwriting then you got a partial\nright on the log file and\n\n386\n00:22:18.910 --> 00:22:22.210\nthey can just throw that away\nthe actual file is still intact.\n\n387\n00:22:22.210 --> 00:22:25.190\nVersus if you're writing to the real file\nand you're half way to the right and\n\n388\n00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:28.940\nyou have a power outage well you\njust corrupted the real file.\n\n389\n00:22:28.940 --> 00:22:32.930\nSo journally files seems a very,\nvery safe and stable.\n\n390\n00:22:32.930 --> 00:22:35.020\nAnd for a long time,\nwe just didn't have them.\n\n391\n00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:40.550\nApple has the journaling file system with\ntheir HFS+, and in Linux we have a couple\n\n392\n00:22:40.550 --> 00:22:43.810\nof different file systems that support\nit ReiserFS was one of the first ones.\n\n393\n00:22:43.810 --> 00:22:47.850\nNow, ReiserFS would have\nbeen a lot more successful,\n\n394\n00:22:47.850 --> 00:22:50.550\nexcept the thing Ronnie is laughing about.\n\n395\n00:22:50.550 --> 00:22:55.520\nThe author had a little dispute with\nhis wife, and he might have killed her.\n\n396\n00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:59.460\nI guess it's not so much of a might,\nhe's in jail, right, he's getting on.\n\n397\n00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:03.050\nSo that slowed the development\nof the file system quite a bit.\n\n398\n00:23:03.050 --> 00:23:04.878\nAnd that technology has now bled over.\n\n399\n00:23:04.878 --> 00:23:07.034\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n400\n00:23:07.034 --> 00:23:08.521\n>> No pun intended, but\n\n401\n00:23:08.521 --> 00:23:12.245\nit's moved over into some\nof the other file systems.\n\n402\n00:23:12.245 --> 00:23:16.495\nSo while the other file systems have\nbenefited from that technology, well\n\n403\n00:23:16.495 --> 00:23:21.200\nthe actual ReiserFS hasn't really moved\nforward the way that it was supposed to.\n\n404\n00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:25.930\nSo you will still see it out there,\nthere's support4 it is a good file system.\n\n405\n00:23:25.930 --> 00:23:30.700\nIt just had a lot of drama or\nwhatever attached to it, and\n\n406\n00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:32.530\nit kinda hurt the development of it.\n\n407\n00:23:32.530 --> 00:23:36.450\nSo, but you'll see other file\nsystems like ZFS that are out there.\n\n408\n00:23:36.450 --> 00:23:39.836\nThey're very distributed,\nvery redundant, and\n\n409\n00:23:39.836 --> 00:23:43.702\nI'm very purpose built very,\nvery useful file systems.\n\n410\n00:23:43.702 --> 00:23:48.577\nThe only other note I have is for\ndumpe2fs.\n\n411\n00:23:48.577 --> 00:23:51.828\nDumpe2fs, there.\n\n412\n00:23:51.828 --> 00:23:57.000\nWhich is a utility that will just give\nus information about a file system.\n\n413\n00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:57.661\nAll right,\n\n414\n00:23:57.661 --> 00:24:01.968\nwe saw tune2fs -l where it would give\nus information about the file system.\n\n415\n00:24:01.968 --> 00:24:04.628\nWell, dumpe2fs is kind of the same.\n\n416\n00:24:04.628 --> 00:24:08.419\nIt'll give us information about that\nfile system and throw it On the screen.\n\n417\n00:24:08.419 --> 00:24:13.982\nSo we just pointed at a disk\nlike /dev/sda1, right?\n\n418\n00:24:13.982 --> 00:24:16.022\nI'll do sdb1 since I\ndid that a minute ago.\n\n419\n00:24:16.022 --> 00:24:19.700\nAll right, and there's some information.\n\n420\n00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:22.500\nNow it's a lot of information isn't it?\n\n421\n00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:24.550\nAnd some of it is not\nincredibly useful but\n\n422\n00:24:24.550 --> 00:24:27.430\nwe'll see a lot of data about our system.\n\n423\n00:24:27.430 --> 00:24:32.776\nI usually add one more thing\nto it which is the old -h and\n\n424\n00:24:32.776 --> 00:24:36.820\nthat gives us a slightly\nmore human readable output.\n\n425\n00:24:36.820 --> 00:24:40.160\nIt's a little more useful for\nus and we can see some information.\n\n426\n00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:42.560\nLet me filter this into less.\n\n427\n00:24:43.780 --> 00:24:44.842\nClear You know.\n\n428\n00:24:44.842 --> 00:24:46.865\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I keep doing that, Jeez.\n\n429\n00:24:46.865 --> 00:24:50.075\nOne of these days I'll remember\nto hit the up arrow enough.\n\n430\n00:24:50.075 --> 00:24:52.085\nOkay, so here I am looking at that and\n\n431\n00:24:52.085 --> 00:24:55.405\nyou'll notice the output is\nextremely similar to tune2fs-l.\n\n432\n00:24:55.405 --> 00:24:59.160\nThey're really doing the same thing,\ngiving us that output about our disk.\n\n433\n00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:03.140\nAnd so I can see the label,\nI can see other information about it.\n\n434\n00:25:03.140 --> 00:25:08.120\nI can see the file system state,\nand that it's clean.\n\n435\n00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:10.120\nThat means it passed its last check, and\n\n436\n00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:13.150\nthen it's healthy as far as our\noperating system knows about it.\n\n437\n00:25:13.150 --> 00:25:16.750\nI can see it's got Linux, it's separate,\nit's file system OS type.\n\n438\n00:25:16.750 --> 00:25:18.790\nAnd then I can start to\nsee some information.\n\n439\n00:25:18.790 --> 00:25:22.180\nNow what is some of this information?\n\n440\n00:25:22.180 --> 00:25:25.260\nWell if you look there's one\nentry in here called an inode,\n\n441\n00:25:25.260 --> 00:25:27.850\nand we're gonna talk about\ninodes a little bit later but\n\n442\n00:25:27.850 --> 00:25:30.950\nI wanna mention what they are now so\nwe're ready for it.\n\n443\n00:25:30.950 --> 00:25:35.360\nWhen you format a disc,\nduring the format operation\n\n444\n00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:39.710\nIt has to figure out how big the block\nsize is going to be for your disk.\n\n445\n00:25:39.710 --> 00:25:40.760\nAnd you'll see it down here.\n\n446\n00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:44.360\nMy block size is 4096 bytes, okay.\n\n447\n00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:48.620\nAnd that means that when I\nwrite data to a hard drive,\n\n448\n00:25:48.620 --> 00:25:53.370\nthe smallest amount of data I\ncan write is one block, right.\n\n449\n00:25:53.370 --> 00:25:58.460\nAnd so when I write that in there no\nmatter how small my data is, it's gonna\n\n450\n00:25:58.460 --> 00:26:03.370\ntake at least 4,096 bytes because that's\nwhat my block size is on this system.\n\n451\n00:26:03.370 --> 00:26:04.190\nAll right?\n\n452\n00:26:04.190 --> 00:26:07.670\nSo our i nodes are calculated\nbased off of that.\n\n453\n00:26:07.670 --> 00:26:10.040\nThis idea that no matter\nhow small a file is,\n\n454\n00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:12.580\nit's always gonna take at least\na certain amount of space.\n\n455\n00:26:12.580 --> 00:26:16.480\nAnd I know this is really important,\na lot of operating systems don't take this\n\n456\n00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:20.910\ninto account, Windows is bad about it,\nwhere it'll show you what your file size\n\n457\n00:26:20.910 --> 00:26:23.260\nis on your hard drive,\nhow much space you have available.\n\n458\n00:26:23.260 --> 00:26:27.010\nBut it's not taking in account the fact\nthat small files might be taking\n\n459\n00:26:27.010 --> 00:26:29.360\nup more space than they actually are.\n\n460\n00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:34.230\nIt might be a 1K file But on the hard\ndrive it's actually consuming 4k of space.\n\n461\n00:26:34.230 --> 00:26:37.630\nNow, in the Windows world,\nwe usually have large files, right?\n\n462\n00:26:37.630 --> 00:26:38.580\nIt's all bloated.\n\n463\n00:26:38.580 --> 00:26:39.960\nBut those large files,\n\n464\n00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:44.020\nif you've got a 5 meg file, what's\nthe big deal if it eats an extra 4k?\n\n465\n00:26:44.020 --> 00:26:46.040\nNobody notices, right?\n\n466\n00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:50.150\nBut in the Linux world, where almost\neverything is represented as a file,\n\n467\n00:26:50.150 --> 00:26:55.170\nwe have tens of thousands of files\nthat are under 1k in size, and\n\n468\n00:26:55.170 --> 00:26:57.960\nthose all consume more than 1k.\n\n469\n00:26:57.960 --> 00:27:03.040\nThey actually consume 4k of space\nif our block size is 4,096 bytes.\n\n470\n00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:06.800\nWe start to reflect our sizes differently.\n\n471\n00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:10.110\nIn Linux,\nit actually pays attention to the inodes.\n\n472\n00:27:10.110 --> 00:27:11.320\nIt's watching out for\n\n473\n00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:15.590\nthat to see exactly what our\navailability is based on the inodes.\n\n474\n00:27:15.590 --> 00:27:16.160\nAll right.\n\n475\n00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:19.670\nSo it's a little smarter than just\nlooking at the straight out bits.\n\n476\n00:27:19.670 --> 00:27:21.670\nIt looks at the inodes and\nis able to calculate from there.\n\n477\n00:27:21.670 --> 00:27:23.940\nSo you'll see that notation\nin a number of places.\n\n478\n00:27:23.940 --> 00:27:26.580\nI'm going to reference it later\nwhen we talks about links.\n\n479\n00:27:26.580 --> 00:27:30.356\nBut I can see here my free\nblocks versus my free inodes.\n\n480\n00:27:30.356 --> 00:27:36.328\nAnd my inode count so\nif I look here my inode count 2359296 but,\n\n481\n00:27:36.328 --> 00:27:39.175\nmy free inodes 2359285.\n\n482\n00:27:39.175 --> 00:27:41.556\nSo, I'm consuming some inodes on here.\n\n483\n00:27:41.556 --> 00:27:43.260\nThis is that drive I just formatted.\n\n484\n00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:45.420\nThat's why there's such a big difference.\n\n485\n00:27:45.420 --> 00:27:47.120\nI mean such a small difference.\n\n486\n00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:49.731\nIf I were to look at something like.\n\n487\n00:27:50.856 --> 00:27:55.271\nWhat was it,\nVolGroup-lv_root I think was my root one,\n\n488\n00:27:55.271 --> 00:28:00.470\nI can look here and I should see\na bigger difference on this one.\n\n489\n00:28:00.470 --> 00:28:05.170\nSo I can see my inode count of a hundred\nor 1 million 1 hundred and 48 thousand and\n\n490\n00:28:05.170 --> 00:28:08.020\nmy free count of just 1 million and\nseventy thousand.\n\n491\n00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:10.960\nSo a much bigger difference there\nbecause I am actually consuming space\n\n492\n00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:14.270\non that drive.\n\n493\n00:28:14.270 --> 00:28:17.869\nAll right, so those are some of the things\nthat we can see in there as far as\n\n494\n00:28:17.869 --> 00:28:22.310\nother information we've got a file system\ncreated, last mount time, last write time.\n\n495\n00:28:22.310 --> 00:28:26.240\nSo you can see how active that disk is,\nif people are working in it.\n\n496\n00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:28.780\nThe mount count, that's useful.\n\n497\n00:28:28.780 --> 00:28:31.540\nCuz if I have it set to\nscan every 20 mounts,\n\n498\n00:28:31.540 --> 00:28:34.520\nI know I'm on my 14th mount right now.\n\n499\n00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:38.260\nSo in six more mounts, six more reboots,\nit's gonna scan that disk.\n\n500\n00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:41.750\nAnd then we can look at\nsome of the other entries.\n\n501\n00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:44.660\nI don't actually have a maximum\nmount count set on this one.\n\n502\n00:28:44.660 --> 00:28:49.740\nSo if were to set my max mount count to\n15, when I reboot it it's gonna do a scan.\n\n503\n00:28:49.740 --> 00:28:53.000\nOr if I set it to 14, for\nthat matter, it would do a scan too.\n\n504\n00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:54.840\nWe can see the lifetime writes.\n\n505\n00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:58.970\nNow, that used to be a value that I didn't\nreally care about but it today's world of\n\n506\n00:28:58.970 --> 00:29:02.950\nSSDs, Solid State Digital,\nyou have a lifetime on that disk, right?\n\n507\n00:29:02.950 --> 00:29:04.090\nThe more you write to it,\n\n508\n00:29:04.090 --> 00:29:06.220\nthe closer you get to the end\nof the lifetime of that disk.\n\n509\n00:29:06.220 --> 00:29:10.240\nSo being able to track how much data\nhas been written to it is useful for\n\n510\n00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:11.590\nseeing when it's gonna fail.\n\n511\n00:29:11.590 --> 00:29:13.860\nRonnie, didn't you just read\na study on that earlier this week?\n\n512\n00:29:13.860 --> 00:29:14.580\n>> Yeah.\n\n513\n00:29:14.580 --> 00:29:18.470\n>> And what was the average fail rate for\nthose SSDs.\n\n514\n00:29:18.470 --> 00:29:22.510\n>> About 700 plus\nterabytes is what it was.\n\n515\n00:29:22.510 --> 00:29:27.110\nSo I naturally did do a scan even on just\nregular consumer level hard drives here,\n\n516\n00:29:27.110 --> 00:29:31.477\nthey did 5 different consumer level\nSSD drives, over 700 terabytes.\n\n517\n00:29:31.477 --> 00:29:34.970\n>> 700 terra so that's about what,\nthree days of bit torrent traffic?\n\n518\n00:29:34.970 --> 00:29:35.770\n>> Yeah.\n\n519\n00:29:35.770 --> 00:29:39.230\n>> And. [LAUGH] >> At least for\nNate over there.\n\n520\n00:29:39.230 --> 00:29:41.330\n>> But.\n[LAUGH] So anyhow,\n\n521\n00:29:41.330 --> 00:29:42.380\nit is big\n>> But\n\n522\n00:29:42.380 --> 00:29:46.480\nbeing able to track that lifetime,\nhow much we've done to that disk,\n\n523\n00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:49.900\nthen that's gonna help us recognize\nwhen it's time to replace it and so on.\n\n524\n00:29:49.900 --> 00:29:51.940\nSo that's good useful stuff, and\n\n525\n00:29:51.940 --> 00:29:55.970\nthere's a handful of other things\nin there that you can look at.\n\n526\n00:29:55.970 --> 00:29:57.540\nI can see for mine, for example,\n\n527\n00:29:57.540 --> 00:30:03.030\nI've got journal features, journal\nincompatible revoke, so apparently I\n\n528\n00:30:03.030 --> 00:30:07.980\ngot some compatibility measures turned on,\nbut I can see my journal size, 128 megs.\n\n529\n00:30:07.980 --> 00:30:12.630\nThat means I can receive up to\n128 megs of data in my journal,\n\n530\n00:30:12.630 --> 00:30:15.030\nwithout actually writing\nto the hard drive.\n\n531\n00:30:15.030 --> 00:30:17.210\nSo that's that space where\nit's storing those writes, and\n\n532\n00:30:17.210 --> 00:30:18.530\nhopefully data doesn't\nstay in there very long.\n\n533\n00:30:20.620 --> 00:30:24.710\nAll right, so those are some of the file\nsystem utilities we have as far as just\n\n534\n00:30:24.710 --> 00:30:29.540\nlooking at our system keeping it healthy,\nfinding our free space, doing our checks.\n\n535\n00:30:29.540 --> 00:30:33.260\nThese are the things that we've\ngot available, all right.\n\n536\n00:30:33.260 --> 00:30:35.550\nI think that's good enough for\nfile system health.\n\n537\n00:30:35.550 --> 00:30:39.250\nI do wanna talk a little bit more about\na few other neat file system features, but\n\n538\n00:30:39.250 --> 00:30:40.040\nlet's take a break.\n\n539\n00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:40.700\n>> Okay.\n>> And\n\n540\n00:30:40.700 --> 00:30:42.130\nwhen we get back we can jump into those.\n\n541\n00:30:42.130 --> 00:30:42.810\nSound good Ronnie?\n\n542\n00:30:42.810 --> 00:30:43.490\n>> Sounds great.\n\n543\n00:30:43.490 --> 00:30:44.300\n>> All right ladies and gentlemen,\n\n544\n00:30:44.300 --> 00:30:46.008\nstay tuned\n>> We'll be back after this.\n\n545\n00:30:46.008 --> 00:30:53.106\n[SOUND].\n\n546\n00:30:53.106 --> 00:30:55.250\nAll right, welcome back everybody.\n\n547\n00:30:55.250 --> 00:30:59.992\nSo, what we wanna do in this segment is\nwe wanna take a trip down memory lane.\n\n548\n00:30:59.992 --> 00:31:01.520\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Believe it or\n\n549\n00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:05.380\nnot, there was a time\n>> Where you couldn't buy a one\n\n550\n00:31:05.380 --> 00:31:06.280\nterabyte hard drive.\n\n551\n00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:07.210\n>> It's true.\n\n552\n00:31:07.210 --> 00:31:11.675\n>> And a terabyte of hard drive\nspace certainly wasn't a $100.\n\n553\n00:31:11.675 --> 00:31:12.279\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n554\n00:31:12.279 --> 00:31:13.770\n>> There was a time when we didn't have\n\n555\n00:31:13.770 --> 00:31:15.300\nmuch storage at all and\n\n556\n00:31:15.300 --> 00:31:19.300\nin that time, we had to implement\nsomething called storage quotas.\n\n557\n00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:22.670\nNow, not many people use quotas\nanymore because storage has become so\n\n558\n00:31:22.670 --> 00:31:25.630\ncheap a quota is simply a limit.\n\n559\n00:31:25.630 --> 00:31:30.790\nWe impose a limit on the amount of\ndata somebody can put on a hard drive.\n\n560\n00:31:30.790 --> 00:31:33.830\nSo it used to be like, if you signed\nup for an internet service provider,\n\n561\n00:31:33.830 --> 00:31:36.760\nthey'd give you a couple of\ngigabytes on their servers.\n\n562\n00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:38.570\nAnd they knew you were on dial-up.\n\n563\n00:31:38.570 --> 00:31:39.920\nSo you couldn't download stuff right away.\n\n564\n00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:42.920\nSo you might copy that stuff to the ISP,\n\n565\n00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:46.510\nand once it was there,\nthen download it at your own leisure.\n\n566\n00:31:46.510 --> 00:31:50.460\nSo they give you a little bit of space or\nmaybe they give you web hosting services.\n\n567\n00:31:50.460 --> 00:31:53.290\nAnd they gave you 2 gigs of storage for\nyour website.\n\n568\n00:31:53.290 --> 00:31:53.880\nAll right.\n\n569\n00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:55.740\nWell, how do they force that limit on you?\n\n570\n00:31:55.740 --> 00:31:57.820\nHow do they make sure\nthat you only got 2 gigs?\n\n571\n00:31:57.820 --> 00:32:00.790\nWell, one way to do it was to\ngive you your own partition.\n\n572\n00:32:00.790 --> 00:32:02.210\nRight?\nAnd your own mount points and\n\n573\n00:32:02.210 --> 00:32:03.280\nthere you go.\n\n574\n00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:06.738\nBut another way to do it that's\neven easier is to assign a quota.\n\n575\n00:32:06.738 --> 00:32:11.512\nAnd a quota is just a calculated limit\nwhere Linux will look at the files and\n\n576\n00:32:11.512 --> 00:32:14.900\nsee who the owner is,\nwho created Created them, and\n\n577\n00:32:14.900 --> 00:32:19.989\ntally up how much storage they're eating\nup, and impose a limit, all right?\n\n578\n00:32:19.989 --> 00:32:21.160\nSo it's a neat system.\n\n579\n00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:22.840\nIt is still useful today but\n\n580\n00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:26.360\nwe don't use it nearly as much\ncuz of vast amounts of storage.\n\n581\n00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:29.261\nNow, just because you have vast amounts\nof storage doesn't mean you should\n\n582\n00:32:29.261 --> 00:32:29.998\nuse them, right?\n\n583\n00:32:29.998 --> 00:32:34.090\nThe biggest negative about having a lot\nof storage is it's hard to back it up and\n\n584\n00:32:34.090 --> 00:32:34.656\nrestore.\n\n585\n00:32:34.656 --> 00:32:37.290\nIt takes a long time to\nbackup a lot of data.\n\n586\n00:32:37.290 --> 00:32:40.530\nSo we may choose to\nimpose quotas even today\n\n587\n00:32:40.530 --> 00:32:42.640\nto stop people from going crazy, right?\n\n588\n00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:46.050\nJust throwing tons of garbage in there and\nfilling up your system.\n\n589\n00:32:46.050 --> 00:32:50.510\nAll right, so Linux has support for\nquotas built in but it's not turned on.\n\n590\n00:32:50.510 --> 00:32:56.550\nAnd it is handled on a drive by drive and\neven folder by folder basis, all right?\n\n591\n00:32:56.550 --> 00:33:00.360\nIf we want to enable quotas,\nwe have to turn the quotas on for\n\n592\n00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:04.350\nthe disk that we're gonna be monitoring\nthen, and then we have to enable it for\n\n593\n00:33:04.350 --> 00:33:06.260\nindividual folders, all right?\n\n594\n00:33:06.260 --> 00:33:09.700\nSo, the first thing we need to\ndo is we need to modify how our\n\n595\n00:33:09.700 --> 00:33:13.960\nfile system is being mounted so\nit knows to enable quotas, all right?\n\n596\n00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:17.230\nWell, in the last segment,\nI created a partition and I formatted it.\n\n597\n00:33:17.230 --> 00:33:19.290\nAnd I just mounted it to a random folder.\n\n598\n00:33:19.290 --> 00:33:22.050\nWhat I'm gonna do is\nI'm gonna unmount that.\n\n599\n00:33:22.050 --> 00:33:23.820\nActually, I already did.\n\n600\n00:33:23.820 --> 00:33:25.780\nAnd we're gonna remount it, but\n\n601\n00:33:25.780 --> 00:33:28.936\nwe're gonna mount it using\nthe quota system, okay?\n\n602\n00:33:28.936 --> 00:33:31.477\nSo let's take a look at my system,\nI'll show you what I'm talking about.\n\n603\n00:33:31.477 --> 00:33:37.340\nSo before the break,\nI formatted /dev/sdb1, right?\n\n604\n00:33:37.340 --> 00:33:41.860\nAnd it is a 36 gig drive, and it's just\nsitting there ready to rock, okay?\n\n605\n00:33:41.860 --> 00:33:44.190\nBut I haven't actually mounted\nit to any partition or folder or\n\n606\n00:33:44.190 --> 00:33:45.650\nanything like that at this point.\n\n607\n00:33:45.650 --> 00:33:51.770\nAll right, so let's say that I want to\nstart providing storage to my company.\n\n608\n00:33:51.770 --> 00:33:57.510\nSo I want to go in and\ncreate a storage folder,\n\n609\n00:33:57.510 --> 00:34:01.140\nright, or maybe it is my videos folder,\nor whatever it happens to be, right?\n\n610\n00:34:01.140 --> 00:34:05.210\nSo I'm gonna come into the mounter,\nmnt folder, and\n\n611\n00:34:05.210 --> 00:34:09.060\nI'll create a Storage folder in there.\n\n612\n00:34:09.060 --> 00:34:13.790\nAll right, and I wanna mount that\ndrive to this folder, right?\n\n613\n00:34:13.790 --> 00:34:15.630\nThat's where I want it to be mounted to.\n\n614\n00:34:15.630 --> 00:34:19.120\nBut I also wanted to\nhave the quota options.\n\n615\n00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:22.448\nSo the best way to do that is\nto attach it to the fstab,\n\n616\n00:34:22.448 --> 00:34:25.867\nthe file system table, and\nput the options in there.\n\n617\n00:34:25.867 --> 00:34:27.086\nSo that's what I'm gonna do.\n\n618\n00:34:27.086 --> 00:34:32.785\nI'm gonna edit my /etc/fstab file.\n\n619\n00:34:32.785 --> 00:34:36.289\nAnd I'm gonna add in this new partition.\n\n620\n00:34:36.289 --> 00:34:39.806\nI'll just stick it right\nafter my root entry here.\n\n621\n00:34:39.806 --> 00:34:44.669\nSo I'm gonna say /dev/sdb1 is ext4.\n\n622\n00:34:44.669 --> 00:34:49.028\nAnd, oops, nope, sorry that's\nsupposed to be my mount point.\n\n623\n00:34:49.028 --> 00:34:54.989\nMy mount point is /mnt/storage, then ext4.\n\n624\n00:34:54.989 --> 00:34:57.720\nAnd then this next one is\nwhere we put our options.\n\n625\n00:34:57.720 --> 00:35:02.270\nAnd you'll see on the other ones, I just\nleft it where I said defaults, okay?\n\n626\n00:35:02.270 --> 00:35:08.525\nBut on this one, I'm gonna specify that\nI want to enable quotas, all right?\n\n627\n00:35:08.525 --> 00:35:12.635\nNow there are user quotas and\nthere are group quotas.\n\n628\n00:35:12.635 --> 00:35:15.925\nI may wanna track the drive\nutilization on a per-user basis.\n\n629\n00:35:15.925 --> 00:35:17.690\nThat's gonna be a user quota.\n\n630\n00:35:17.690 --> 00:35:22.100\nOr I might wanna track it based on groups\nand say like the sales department has this\n\n631\n00:35:22.100 --> 00:35:25.190\nmuch storage and the marketing\ndepartment has this much storage.\n\n632\n00:35:25.190 --> 00:35:26.660\nOr I might wanna do both, right?\n\n633\n00:35:26.660 --> 00:35:28.160\nI'm gonna go ahead and turn on both.\n\n634\n00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:30.260\nSo to turn on both,\nI just come in here and\n\n635\n00:35:30.260 --> 00:35:39.020\nI say usrquota,grpquota like that,\nall right?\n\n636\n00:35:39.020 --> 00:35:43.320\nI'm putting in those two options to\ntell it I wanna do quota tracking for\n\n637\n00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:45.230\nusers and groups.\n\n638\n00:35:45.230 --> 00:35:48.162\nAnd then I'm gonna follow that\nup with 1 space 1 saying 1,\n\n639\n00:35:48.162 --> 00:35:51.060\nthis is the drive I wanna back up, and 1,\n\n640\n00:35:51.060 --> 00:35:56.250\nit's a drive I want to do integrity checks\non in case there's corruption, all right?\n\n641\n00:35:56.250 --> 00:35:59.980\nSo putting those options in\nthere is what's gonna turn\n\n642\n00:35:59.980 --> 00:36:02.310\non that quota system for me.\n\n643\n00:36:02.310 --> 00:36:03.827\nAnd I can save that.\n\n644\n00:36:03.827 --> 00:36:10.328\nAnd now,\nIf I just take a look at how that is.\n\n645\n00:36:10.328 --> 00:36:13.631\nThe word wrap kinda makes it hard to read,\nbut I'll see those options are there.\n\n646\n00:36:13.631 --> 00:36:17.479\nAnd when I reboot,\nit's gonna mount that to /mnt/storage,\n\n647\n00:36:17.479 --> 00:36:21.195\nso it'll be there waiting for\nme and quotas will be enabled.\n\n648\n00:36:21.195 --> 00:36:23.720\nNow, I haven't actually defined quotas.\n\n649\n00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:27.300\nThis is really step one of the process for\nenabling quotas, and\n\n650\n00:36:27.300 --> 00:36:28.670\nthere's really four steps.\n\n651\n00:36:28.670 --> 00:36:31.540\nOkay, step one, turn on the options.\n\n652\n00:36:31.540 --> 00:36:33.470\nStep two, reboot, that one's easy.\n\n653\n00:36:33.470 --> 00:36:34.930\nWe do have to reboot for this to happen.\n\n654\n00:36:34.930 --> 00:36:39.730\nI'm not aware of any way to make that\napply without a reboot, so I'll do that.\n\n655\n00:36:39.730 --> 00:36:45.190\nStep three, I need to create the quota\nconfiguration files, all right?\n\n656\n00:36:45.190 --> 00:36:49.440\nLinux has support for quotas by default,\nbut the configuration files aren't there.\n\n657\n00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:52.950\nWe need to tell it what parts of the file\nsystem we're gonna be doing quotas on and\n\n658\n00:36:52.950 --> 00:36:53.910\nwe need to get it set up.\n\n659\n00:36:53.910 --> 00:36:56.430\nAnd so creating those\nconfiguration files are next.\n\n660\n00:36:56.430 --> 00:36:59.770\nAnd then the last part is where\nwe'll actually assign the quotas\n\n661\n00:36:59.770 --> 00:37:04.570\nto a directory or to wherever it is\nthat we're protecting that information.\n\n662\n00:37:04.570 --> 00:37:10.053\nSo, those two steps will happen here\nin a moment after the system reboots.\n\n663\n00:37:10.053 --> 00:37:14.157\nSo we will wait patiently, or\nimpatiently, while it does that.\n\n664\n00:37:14.157 --> 00:37:16.723\nIt is kinda churning along.\n\n665\n00:37:16.723 --> 00:37:18.684\n[LAUGH] And-\n>> Not too bad.\n\n666\n00:37:18.684 --> 00:37:21.090\n>> Yeah, sooner or later.\n\n667\n00:37:21.090 --> 00:37:22.040\nIt boots pretty fast.\n\n668\n00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:24.670\nThere's not much going on in this system.\n\n669\n00:37:24.670 --> 00:37:27.251\nBut when it reboots, it's gonna go and\nmount those drives and\n\n670\n00:37:27.251 --> 00:37:29.351\nit's gonna see those quota\noptions at that time.\n\n671\n00:37:29.351 --> 00:37:33.003\nAnd now that I am fired back up,\n\n672\n00:37:33.003 --> 00:37:38.210\nI should be able to go into /mnt/storage.\n\n673\n00:37:38.210 --> 00:37:41.180\nAnd when you see that lost and\nfound folder,\n\n674\n00:37:41.180 --> 00:37:46.156\nthat's your first hint that you're\nactually in a different partition,\n\n675\n00:37:46.156 --> 00:37:50.261\nI'm just gonna copy some files\ninto here with my VP command.\n\n676\n00:37:50.261 --> 00:37:52.436\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> With cp, so let me get,\n\n677\n00:37:52.436 --> 00:37:54.273\nwhat was I doing the other day?\n\n678\n00:37:54.273 --> 00:37:55.991\nIt was VMware tools.\n\n679\n00:37:55.991 --> 00:37:59.520\nLooks like I deleted a lot of them.\n\n680\n00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:05.178\nAnd I'll just make up names for\nthese guys so they look like files.\n\n681\n00:38:07.546 --> 00:38:09.586\nAnd I'll just throw a couple\nof them in there just so\n\n682\n00:38:09.586 --> 00:38:11.270\nwe have something in there, okay?\n\n683\n00:38:11.270 --> 00:38:12.590\nAll right, so I can see it.\n\n684\n00:38:12.590 --> 00:38:14.420\nI've got four files in there.\n\n685\n00:38:14.420 --> 00:38:20.820\nEach one is about 60 megs, so I should\nhave about 250 megs of data in here.\n\n686\n00:38:20.820 --> 00:38:25.410\nAnd if I do a df -h to\nlook at my file system,\n\n687\n00:38:25.410 --> 00:38:32.080\nI can see where that /mnt/storage is 36\ngigs and I'm eating about 410 megs on it.\n\n688\n00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:33.450\nI guess my math was bad.\n\n689\n00:38:33.450 --> 00:38:36.000\nSo we can see that right there.\n\n690\n00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:38.950\nI do know that it is that other drive and\nit is mounted, all right?\n\n691\n00:38:38.950 --> 00:38:43.410\nNot only is it mounted, it's mounted\nwith the quota arguments turned on.\n\n692\n00:38:43.410 --> 00:38:45.115\nSo now I'm ready.\n\n693\n00:38:45.115 --> 00:38:48.515\nNow, I'm actually in a place\nwhere I have the ability\n\n694\n00:38:48.515 --> 00:38:52.035\nto impose those limitations on my users,\nright?\n\n695\n00:38:52.035 --> 00:38:54.205\nSo how do we go about imposing the limits?\n\n696\n00:38:54.205 --> 00:38:57.163\nWell, step one,\nwe've got to create our quota files.\n\n697\n00:38:57.163 --> 00:39:01.933\nNow, we don't necessarily want to create\nquotas on our hard drive as a whole,\n\n698\n00:39:01.933 --> 00:39:02.451\nright?\n\n699\n00:39:02.451 --> 00:39:03.571\nAnd the main reason is,\n\n700\n00:39:03.571 --> 00:39:06.615\nyou gotta be careful with users\nlike the root user in the system.\n\n701\n00:39:06.615 --> 00:39:09.301\nYou never wanna limit the system\nfrom being able to create files.\n\n702\n00:39:09.301 --> 00:39:14.068\nSo we're normally keeping our quotas\ntailored down to one particular area.\n\n703\n00:39:14.068 --> 00:39:17.411\nWe don't wanna go crazy with it because it\ndoes create a little bit of a performance\n\n704\n00:39:17.411 --> 00:39:20.752\nhit cuz it's gotta calculate quotas every\ntime you write files to see if you're in\n\n705\n00:39:20.752 --> 00:39:21.960\nviolation.\n\n706\n00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:23.640\nSo we don't necessarily wanna go crazy.\n\n707\n00:39:25.030 --> 00:39:28.890\nNormally, we pick a particular folder or\nlocation and that's what we protect.\n\n708\n00:39:28.890 --> 00:39:32.060\nSo, I'm gonna protect this storage folder.\n\n709\n00:39:32.060 --> 00:39:35.339\nI don't want people putting too much\nin the storage folder, all right?\n\n710\n00:39:35.339 --> 00:39:38.782\nMaybe I want to allow people\nto have 2 gigs each, right?\n\n711\n00:39:38.782 --> 00:39:41.819\nAnd maybe I wanna do it by user or\nby group.\n\n712\n00:39:41.819 --> 00:39:43.596\nI don't know,\nI haven't made up my mind yet, right?\n\n713\n00:39:43.596 --> 00:39:45.927\nBut, we'll say we do it by user, right?\n\n714\n00:39:45.927 --> 00:39:50.414\nSo I wanna make sure that no user can do\nmore than 2 gigabytes of storage there.\n\n715\n00:39:50.414 --> 00:39:53.900\nSo, first thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna\ntell it to create the configuration file.\n\n716\n00:39:53.900 --> 00:39:57.558\nAnd we do that with\nthe quotacheck command.\n\n717\n00:39:57.558 --> 00:40:01.766\nQuotacheck, if you run that command,\nyou'll see it's got information in\n\n718\n00:40:01.766 --> 00:40:05.528\nhere and it says, utility for\nchecking and repairing quota files.\n\n719\n00:40:05.528 --> 00:40:08.280\nWhat it doesn't say is,\nit'll create them if they're missing and\n\n720\n00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:09.207\nthat's what we need.\n\n721\n00:40:09.207 --> 00:40:10.727\nAnd you can create quota files.\n\n722\n00:40:10.727 --> 00:40:12.797\nWell, the first three\nare the options we need.\n\n723\n00:40:12.797 --> 00:40:17.039\nIt can create the user, group, well,\nuser and group can config files, and\n\n724\n00:40:17.039 --> 00:40:19.840\nthen it can create the files\nif they're missing.\n\n725\n00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:21.936\nThat -c, that's the one we want,\nall right?\n\n726\n00:40:21.936 --> 00:40:26.650\nThe other options here are for things like\ninteractive mode and stuff like that.\n\n727\n00:40:26.650 --> 00:40:30.859\nYou can even do the try-remount if you\nwant to try remounting the system file\n\n728\n00:40:30.859 --> 00:40:32.979\nread only to manipulate the options.\n\n729\n00:40:32.979 --> 00:40:38.809\nWe shouldn't need to do that because\nwe've already got them turned on,\n\n730\n00:40:38.809 --> 00:40:42.834\nso all I should have to do\nis run quotacheck -ugc.\n\n731\n00:40:42.834 --> 00:40:45.927\nSo go ahead and create the user and\n\n732\n00:40:45.927 --> 00:40:50.801\ngroup quota files for\n/mnt/Storage, all right?\n\n733\n00:40:50.801 --> 00:40:55.520\nNow /mnt/Storage,\nthat's the root of that drive.\n\n734\n00:40:55.520 --> 00:40:56.149\nIt doesn't have to be.\n\n735\n00:40:56.149 --> 00:40:57.496\nIt could be a sub folder, right?\n\n736\n00:40:57.496 --> 00:40:59.168\nI could do /home if I wanted.\n\n737\n00:40:59.168 --> 00:41:03.044\nThat's not on it's own drive,\nnot on this system at least, so\n\n738\n00:41:03.044 --> 00:41:05.911\nI could turn it on for\nthat one also if I wanted.\n\n739\n00:41:05.911 --> 00:41:07.420\nSo I'll run it here.\n\n740\n00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:09.750\nPermission denied.\n\n741\n00:41:09.750 --> 00:41:12.833\nWhy did I get permission denied?\n\n742\n00:41:12.833 --> 00:41:14.272\nDid I mount that read only?\n\n743\n00:41:14.272 --> 00:41:19.241\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Where is it in my list?\n\n744\n00:41:19.241 --> 00:41:22.329\n/Storage, no, it's mounted read/write.\n\n745\n00:41:24.924 --> 00:41:27.533\nWith user quota and group,\nso I'm looking here in my,\n\n746\n00:41:27.533 --> 00:41:31.277\nif you just type mount, it gives you the\nsummary of your mounts and I thought for\n\n747\n00:41:31.277 --> 00:41:34.251\na second that I might have screwed up and\nmounted it read only.\n\n748\n00:41:34.251 --> 00:41:39.260\nSince I'm logged in as the root user, so\nI should be able to do whatever I want.\n\n749\n00:41:39.260 --> 00:41:46.744\nAnd so I can see in here where\nmy /mnt/Storage right here.\n\n750\n00:41:46.744 --> 00:41:52.255\nSo /dev/sdb1 type ext4\n(rw,usrquota,grpquota).\n\n751\n00:41:52.255 --> 00:41:55.698\nSo everything's in there\nlike I would expect it, but\n\n752\n00:41:55.698 --> 00:41:59.150\nthen I got a deny on actually\ncreating the quota file.\n\n753\n00:41:59.150 --> 00:42:01.600\nSo interesting,\n\n754\n00:42:01.600 --> 00:42:06.070\nwhy did it cannot initialize IO on\nnew quota file, permission denied?\n\n755\n00:42:06.070 --> 00:42:11.260\nHm, why would I get\npermission denied on that?\n\n756\n00:42:11.260 --> 00:42:15.149\nLet me just do a quick test and\nI'll do like /home.\n\n757\n00:42:17.848 --> 00:42:21.250\nAnd see, I don't have the quota\noptions turned on there.\n\n758\n00:42:21.250 --> 00:42:23.747\nLet me try another directory real quick.\n\n759\n00:42:32.114 --> 00:42:33.650\nOkay yeah, so it's not working there.\n\n760\n00:42:34.720 --> 00:42:36.790\nYes, why am I getting permission denied?\n\n761\n00:42:36.790 --> 00:42:37.710\nI am root.\n\n762\n00:42:37.710 --> 00:42:39.370\nI got my little hash mark.\n\n763\n00:42:39.370 --> 00:42:44.160\nYeah, I am root, so\nthere is no reason why I should.\n\n764\n00:42:44.160 --> 00:42:45.760\nLet me just try that again real quick.\n\n765\n00:42:45.760 --> 00:42:47.736\nSo if I do quotacheck.\n\n766\n00:42:47.736 --> 00:42:51.799\n>> Why is no quota in the hash?\n\n767\n00:42:51.799 --> 00:42:56.711\n>> Let me just try creating it first and\nthen I'll do the other one.\n\n768\n00:42:56.711 --> 00:42:58.545\nWell no,\nit's just straight up permission denied.\n\n769\n00:42:58.545 --> 00:43:03.170\nHm, cannot create new\nquotafile aquota.user.new\n\n770\n00:43:03.170 --> 00:43:04.440\npermission denied, strange.\n\n771\n00:43:05.970 --> 00:43:07.450\nAll right, I must be missing a step.\n\n772\n00:43:07.450 --> 00:43:08.510\nWell, let's do this.\n\n773\n00:43:09.570 --> 00:43:11.470\nI'm not gonna get very far here\nif I can't create my quota files.\n\n774\n00:43:11.470 --> 00:43:15.180\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> This is kind of a key step, right?\n\n775\n00:43:15.180 --> 00:43:20.320\nWhat we should do here is we run the quota\ncheck, we tell it to create the user and\n\n776\n00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:23.930\ngroup files, and\nonce those files are in place, right?\n\n777\n00:43:23.930 --> 00:43:27.615\nAnd you kind of see back\nhere when I did the -cug.\n\n778\n00:43:28.700 --> 00:43:31.100\nWhen I ran that,\nsee what it's trying to do?\n\n779\n00:43:31.100 --> 00:43:36.670\nIt's trying to create aquota.user.new and\naquota.group.new.\n\n780\n00:43:36.670 --> 00:43:38.890\nThose are the quota files, all right?\n\n781\n00:43:38.890 --> 00:43:42.130\nOnce those are in place,\nwe can then go in and\n\n782\n00:43:42.130 --> 00:43:45.950\nedit them to assign what we want\nthe quotas to be for those people.\n\n783\n00:43:45.950 --> 00:43:50.380\nBut for whatever reason it doesn't\nseem to want to do that, and so\n\n784\n00:43:50.380 --> 00:43:52.300\nthat's gonna kind of limit me down.\n\n785\n00:43:52.300 --> 00:43:54.512\nLet me see if I can do like an edquota.\n\n786\n00:43:58.538 --> 00:44:01.630\nNo file, yeah,\nsee it can't get to aquota.user.\n\n787\n00:44:01.630 --> 00:44:02.490\nStrange.\n\n788\n00:44:02.490 --> 00:44:03.990\nWhy is it not letting me do that?\n\n789\n00:44:03.990 --> 00:44:05.782\nNo filesystems with quota detected.\n\n790\n00:44:07.077 --> 00:44:10.009\nHm, well, let's do this.\n\n791\n00:44:10.009 --> 00:44:12.921\nLet's take a little time out\nhere while I dig into this and\n\n792\n00:44:12.921 --> 00:44:15.600\nfind out why I'm getting\na permission denied here.\n\n793\n00:44:15.600 --> 00:44:22.225\nI logged in as root, should pretty much\nhave everything that I need, and so yeah.\n\n794\n00:44:22.225 --> 00:44:23.750\nWhat I want to do is I wanna\ndig into the permissions,\n\n795\n00:44:23.750 --> 00:44:25.010\nbut we haven't covered permissions yet.\n\n796\n00:44:25.010 --> 00:44:28.000\nWe're actually going to do\nthat in the next segment.\n\n797\n00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:30.770\nSo let met take a look at this and\nwe'll pick right back up.\n\n798\n00:44:30.770 --> 00:44:32.488\nSo give me just a moment,\nwe'll be right back.\n\n799\n00:44:32.488 --> 00:44:39.730\n[MUSIC]\n\n800\n00:44:39.730 --> 00:44:41.530\nAll right, welcome back, everybody.\n\n801\n00:44:41.530 --> 00:44:44.730\nSo [LAUGH] during the break\nI have found the issue,\n\n802\n00:44:44.730 --> 00:44:46.260\nwhy I was getting permission denied.\n\n803\n00:44:46.260 --> 00:44:47.120\nI forgot about something.\n\n804\n00:44:48.500 --> 00:44:52.695\nRed Hat, a handful of years back,\ncame up with a new security sublayer for\n\n805\n00:44:52.695 --> 00:44:54.057\nLinux called SE Linux.\n\n806\n00:44:54.057 --> 00:44:58.312\nThey did it in coordination with the NSA,\nthis is where this kinda came from,\n\n807\n00:44:58.312 --> 00:45:01.000\nto add an extra level\nof security to Linux.\n\n808\n00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:04.120\nAnd it's turned on by\ndefault in Red Hat and\n\n809\n00:45:04.120 --> 00:45:07.640\nit's turned on by default in CentOS and\nI just forgot about it.\n\n810\n00:45:07.640 --> 00:45:10.470\nWhat it does is it adds\nan extra layer of security, so\n\n811\n00:45:10.470 --> 00:45:13.760\nwe don't just have file permissions,\nwhich I had access to, but\n\n812\n00:45:13.760 --> 00:45:17.380\nprograms themselves are limited to certain\ndirectories where they can operate in.\n\n813\n00:45:17.380 --> 00:45:21.100\nAnd so by default, the quotacheck utility\n\n814\n00:45:21.100 --> 00:45:24.770\ndidn't have access to that\nnew drive that I created.\n\n815\n00:45:24.770 --> 00:45:27.121\nSo that's why I wasn't able to do it and\nI was getting permission denied.\n\n816\n00:45:27.121 --> 00:45:30.727\nNow we're gonna learn more about\nSELinux in the second exam\n\n817\n00:45:30.727 --> 00:45:32.611\nshow in the security modules.\n\n818\n00:45:32.611 --> 00:45:35.990\nIt's actually one of the last things\nwe cover I think, so we'll see it then.\n\n819\n00:45:35.990 --> 00:45:38.720\nI didn't want to fuss with it here,\nso what I did is I just turned\n\n820\n00:45:38.720 --> 00:45:41.728\nit off real quick and then that way\nwe can go through and see our quota.\n\n821\n00:45:41.728 --> 00:45:45.700\nSo I forgot about SELinux and\nthat's where that came from.\n\n822\n00:45:45.700 --> 00:45:47.821\nNow, I just ran my quota check,\n\n823\n00:45:47.821 --> 00:45:52.640\nso if we pull my computer you'll\nsee quotacheck -cug/mnt/Storage.\n\n824\n00:45:52.640 --> 00:45:53.560\nYou don't get any feedback.\n\n825\n00:45:53.560 --> 00:45:54.670\nIt's a super quick thing.\n\n826\n00:45:54.670 --> 00:45:56.860\nIt just creates it and you're in business.\n\n827\n00:45:56.860 --> 00:45:59.290\nSo now my quota files are in place.\n\n828\n00:45:59.290 --> 00:46:02.070\nSo of my four steps,\nI've done three of them, right?\n\n829\n00:46:02.070 --> 00:46:06.680\nWe assigned the quota options\nto our file system in the fstab,\n\n830\n00:46:06.680 --> 00:46:08.060\nin the file system table.\n\n831\n00:46:08.060 --> 00:46:09.830\nWe rebooted, all right?\n\n832\n00:46:09.830 --> 00:46:12.950\nNow we've created the configuration files.\n\n833\n00:46:12.950 --> 00:46:15.070\nNow we just need to go in and\nkind of tweak these and\n\n834\n00:46:15.070 --> 00:46:19.580\nset them the way we want to do, well,\nto do the quotas that we need, right?\n\n835\n00:46:19.580 --> 00:46:25.170\nSo if I want to assign quotas,\nthere's a few ways we can go about that.\n\n836\n00:46:26.410 --> 00:46:28.992\nNow first off,\nif I think quotas are already in place,\n\n837\n00:46:28.992 --> 00:46:30.560\nI can always verify them.\n\n838\n00:46:30.560 --> 00:46:35.150\nHere, I did the quotacheck-c,\nwhich creates them, but we've got some\n\n839\n00:46:35.150 --> 00:46:39.600\nof the other quota check commands\nwhere we can just verify and update.\n\n840\n00:46:39.600 --> 00:46:44.640\nSo for example, if I was just trying\nto check to see if quotas were\n\n841\n00:46:44.640 --> 00:46:52.620\nalready turned on,\nI could run quotacheck -avug, right?\n\n842\n00:46:52.620 --> 00:46:56.220\nSo a, means show me all\nthe volumes that have quotas and\n\n843\n00:46:56.220 --> 00:47:00.560\nv, give me some verbose output and\nshow me user and group quotas.\n\n844\n00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:02.540\nAnd I could just run\nthat by itself really.\n\n845\n00:47:02.540 --> 00:47:04.806\nAnd it'll show me anywhere\nthat I've got it turned on, so\n\n846\n00:47:04.806 --> 00:47:07.922\nit's kinda looking here and it's letting\nme know where I've got it turned on.\n\n847\n00:47:07.922 --> 00:47:12.083\nIt's warning me your kernel probably\nsupports journaled quota, but\n\n848\n00:47:12.083 --> 00:47:13.430\nyou're not using it.\n\n849\n00:47:13.430 --> 00:47:16.220\nConsider switching to\na journaled quota to avoid\n\n850\n00:47:16.220 --> 00:47:18.930\nrunning quotacheck after\nan unclean shutdown.\n\n851\n00:47:18.930 --> 00:47:22.910\nSo it's just warning me that's a feature\nI could turn on if I needed it.\n\n852\n00:47:22.910 --> 00:47:28.380\nThen it scans and it shows /dev/sdb1,\nwhich is /mnt/Storage,\n\n853\n00:47:28.380 --> 00:47:33.130\nand it's there and it's good, and then it\nchecked three directories and six files.\n\n854\n00:47:33.130 --> 00:47:37.230\nThat check, it checked to make sure quotas\nwere turned on, that's what I cared about,\n\n855\n00:47:37.230 --> 00:47:41.110\nbut the other thing that it did\nis it updated the quota database.\n\n856\n00:47:41.110 --> 00:47:44.990\nIt has to look to see whether\npeople are in quota violation.\n\n857\n00:47:44.990 --> 00:47:48.200\nSo we can do a chron job or\nwhatever to schedule this or\n\n858\n00:47:48.200 --> 00:47:51.560\nwe can let it run at boot time or\nwhatever works for our environment.\n\n859\n00:47:51.560 --> 00:47:54.900\nAnd that way we can detect whether\npeople are going over quota.\n\n860\n00:47:54.900 --> 00:47:56.260\nSo looks like I'm good.\n\n861\n00:47:56.260 --> 00:47:57.838\nI've got the quotas turned on.\n\n862\n00:47:57.838 --> 00:47:59.448\nNow I need to configure the quotas.\n\n863\n00:47:59.448 --> 00:48:02.754\nNow to configure the quotas,\nwe used to have go and find the files and\n\n864\n00:48:02.754 --> 00:48:06.234\ndirectly edit them The problem is,\nthe more directories you protect,\n\n865\n00:48:06.234 --> 00:48:10.820\nthe more of those files there are, and it\nbecomes difficult to keep track of them.\n\n866\n00:48:10.820 --> 00:48:14.580\nAnd so, there are some neat little\nutilities we can use to save us some time.\n\n867\n00:48:14.580 --> 00:48:22.840\nWe've got the edquota utility, or\nthe edit Quota, the edquota utility,\n\n868\n00:48:22.840 --> 00:48:27.390\nand that'll let me modify the quota for\nusers in in groups across my system.\n\n869\n00:48:27.390 --> 00:48:30.990\nBasically, what we just do is say edquota,\nand then we specify either the name of\n\n870\n00:48:30.990 --> 00:48:36.390\nthe user, or if it's a group we say -g and\nthe name of the group.\n\n871\n00:48:36.390 --> 00:48:41.390\nIf I've got a marketing group, then I\nwould say edquota-g marketing, or if\n\n872\n00:48:41.390 --> 00:48:47.020\nI wanna edit the quota for my user dpezet,\nI just say edquota dpezet, all right?\n\n873\n00:48:47.020 --> 00:48:48.050\nWhen you go to edit them,\n\n874\n00:48:48.050 --> 00:48:51.990\nit takes whatever your default editor\nis and that's vy and In most systems.\n\n875\n00:48:51.990 --> 00:48:54.550\nAnd basically, it brings them up,\nand it says, here,\n\n876\n00:48:54.550 --> 00:48:57.110\nfor dpezet, what quotas do they have?\n\n877\n00:48:57.110 --> 00:49:01.730\nAnd then, it proceeds to list all of\nthe file systems that have quotas.\n\n878\n00:49:01.730 --> 00:49:08.120\nMy only file system that has a quota\nis Sdb, so I see /dev/sdb1, okay?\n\n879\n00:49:08.120 --> 00:49:11.920\nThere's a little word wrap going on here,\nbut basically what it lists across the top\n\n880\n00:49:11.920 --> 00:49:17.140\nis my file system, and\nthen it shows how many blocks\n\n881\n00:49:17.140 --> 00:49:22.560\nI want to allow people to store and\nhow many inodes I want them to store,\n\n882\n00:49:22.560 --> 00:49:25.910\nand, remember, blocks and\ninodes can be very different.\n\n883\n00:49:25.910 --> 00:49:31.000\nOne block is 4,096 bytes, and so,\nwhen people write to that, that's gonna be\n\n884\n00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:36.180\nthat minimum they use, so I normally do\nmy limits in blocks cuz I know the math.\n\n885\n00:49:36.180 --> 00:49:38.660\nI know it uses a slightly different\nformula to calculate, but\n\n886\n00:49:38.660 --> 00:49:40.800\nit depends on how accurate we wanna be.\n\n887\n00:49:40.800 --> 00:49:44.600\nIf we wanna be truly accurate with\nour quotas, you can use inodes, and\n\n888\n00:49:44.600 --> 00:49:46.240\nyou can be really, really specific.\n\n889\n00:49:46.240 --> 00:49:50.260\nBut if you're just trying to get close\nto a number, you can use blocks.\n\n890\n00:49:50.260 --> 00:49:54.730\nSo for example, if I wanna limit\nmyself to To four gigabytes, right?\n\n891\n00:49:54.730 --> 00:49:57.610\nI'm trying to think of\nsomething that's easy.\n\n892\n00:49:57.610 --> 00:50:02.610\nThen four gigabytes would be how many,\nif I take that down into 4096 bytes,\n\n893\n00:50:02.610 --> 00:50:07.220\nthat would be,\ntrying to do the math on this one So\n\n894\n00:50:07.220 --> 00:50:11.460\na gigabyte would be one million kilobytes,\nright.\n\n895\n00:50:11.460 --> 00:50:13.200\nIt would be one billion bytes.\n\n896\n00:50:14.280 --> 00:50:16.440\nAnd if we divided that by-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n897\n00:50:16.440 --> 00:50:18.320\n>> This should be easier.\n\n898\n00:50:18.320 --> 00:50:21.660\nSo anyhow if I just come in here and\nsay like four zero Shoot,\n\n899\n00:50:21.660 --> 00:50:25.120\nI gotta get into insert mode.\n\n900\n00:50:25.120 --> 00:50:32.510\nIf I say 4096000, well, we'll go there.\n\n901\n00:50:32.510 --> 00:50:36.140\nWe can go smaller than we want to and\nworry about my bad math later.\n\n902\n00:50:36.140 --> 00:50:38.010\nAnd now I've got an extra zero in here.\n\n903\n00:50:38.010 --> 00:50:42.060\nOkay, so I'm just gonna come through and\nspecify how many blocks.\n\n904\n00:50:42.060 --> 00:50:44.670\nI want dpezet to be allowed to write.\n\n905\n00:50:44.670 --> 00:50:45.180\nOkay.\n\n906\n00:50:45.180 --> 00:50:48.730\nRemember that one block is 4096 bytes.\n\n907\n00:50:48.730 --> 00:50:55.420\nAnd so I've got 4096 times what ever this\nnumber to find out what that storage is.\n\n908\n00:50:55.420 --> 00:50:58.390\nIn fact this might actually be\nconsiderably larger than I want.\n\n909\n00:50:58.390 --> 00:50:59.020\nNo I'll just go 1000.\n\n910\n00:50:59.020 --> 00:51:03.640\nSo 1000 times 4096 is how many blocks this\nperson is going to be allowed to write.\n\n911\n00:51:03.640 --> 00:51:05.970\nYou know lets do Do the math on this.\n\n912\n00:51:05.970 --> 00:51:11.755\nSince I'm just, I shouldn't be\nhaving such a hard time with this.\n\n913\n00:51:11.755 --> 00:51:13.528\n4,096 bytes times 1,000.\n\n914\n00:51:16.092 --> 00:51:18.443\nOkay so that would be bytes, k, meg, so\n\n915\n00:51:18.443 --> 00:51:22.880\nI'm sitting 4 megs right now which\nmight me a little on the small side.\n\n916\n00:51:22.880 --> 00:51:24.910\nSo let me bump that a little bit higher.\n\n917\n00:51:24.910 --> 00:51:25.890\nWe'll add an extra zero.\n\n918\n00:51:25.890 --> 00:51:29.880\nSo, if I was at four megs,\nI want to be at four gigs,\n\n919\n00:51:29.880 --> 00:51:34.400\nso I'll just add some extra zeros, there'.\n\n920\n00:51:34.400 --> 00:51:36.930\nSo, now I'm kind of increasing that size.\n\n921\n00:51:36.930 --> 00:51:42.960\nNext, I need to determine weather I'm\ngoing to be doing a soft or a hard quota.\n\n922\n00:51:42.960 --> 00:51:43.900\nNow, with the soft and\n\n923\n00:51:43.900 --> 00:51:48.050\nthe hard values, with these guys we're\nspecifying some interesting stuff.\n\n924\n00:51:48.050 --> 00:51:52.520\nIn fact, we can leave blocks off\nbecause if we're using soft and\n\n925\n00:51:52.520 --> 00:51:55.710\nhard values, we can actually just\nspecify the bytes right here, and\n\n926\n00:51:55.710 --> 00:51:57.880\nthe straight up bytes, and go that way.\n\n927\n00:51:57.880 --> 00:52:03.420\nWhen we say soft versus hard, a soft quota\nis where we throw up an alarm, okay?\n\n928\n00:52:03.420 --> 00:52:07.080\nIf somebody exceeds this quota, we'll\ngenerate a syslog message and say hey,\n\n929\n00:52:07.080 --> 00:52:08.550\nthis person Persons over their quota.\n\n930\n00:52:08.550 --> 00:52:10.860\nBut, we won't actually\ndo anything about it.\n\n931\n00:52:10.860 --> 00:52:12.850\nThat's why it's called a soft quota.\n\n932\n00:52:12.850 --> 00:52:16.060\nWe know somebody violated it,\nbut we don't stop them.\n\n933\n00:52:16.060 --> 00:52:20.680\nAnd a hard quota, that's where we say,\nall right if somebody hits this limit,\n\n934\n00:52:20.680 --> 00:52:22.040\ndon't let them write any more.\n\n935\n00:52:22.040 --> 00:52:25.280\nActually stop them from\nwriting any more data and\n\n936\n00:52:25.280 --> 00:52:27.900\nso it's a hard line where\nwe want to draw that line.\n\n937\n00:52:27.900 --> 00:52:28.630\nRight?\n\n938\n00:52:28.630 --> 00:52:32.870\nIn today's world, oftentimes we're\nforced to do soft quotas, right?\n\n939\n00:52:32.870 --> 00:52:36.790\nYou're CIO or CEO will say you know what,\ndon't stop somebody from working.\n\n940\n00:52:36.790 --> 00:52:39.010\nDon't stop them just because they\nhave too much on the hard drive.\n\n941\n00:52:39.010 --> 00:52:41.040\nThey need to be able to work,\nlet them do it.\n\n942\n00:52:41.040 --> 00:52:43.430\nSet up a flag, so you can go and\nevaluate their data and\n\n943\n00:52:43.430 --> 00:52:46.160\nfind out whether you should peruse some\nstuff, but don't set a hard limit.\n\n944\n00:52:46.160 --> 00:52:48.160\nBut, if you're an internet\nservice provider and\n\n945\n00:52:48.160 --> 00:52:50.840\nyou've promised your\ncustomer 2 gigs of data,\n\n946\n00:52:50.840 --> 00:52:53.900\nthen you don't want to give them\nany more than that 2 gigs of data.\n\n947\n00:52:53.900 --> 00:52:57.490\nAnd, so you'll come in here and\nset that hard limit and impose it.\n\n948\n00:52:57.490 --> 00:53:01.340\nAnd, these are a little bit easier to use\nbecause when we populate these values\n\n949\n00:53:01.340 --> 00:53:04.260\nWell, it's just straight up in bytes.\n\n950\n00:53:04.260 --> 00:53:08.880\nSo if I want somebody to have one gigabyte\nof data, that would be, let's see, so\n\n951\n00:53:08.880 --> 00:53:15.220\nwe have gigs, megs, k, and then bytes.\n\n952\n00:53:15.220 --> 00:53:18.620\nSo there we go, there's my hard\nquota that I just put in place.\n\n953\n00:53:18.620 --> 00:53:22.360\nSo by leaving soft at zero,\nblocks at zero, and\n\n954\n00:53:22.360 --> 00:53:26.240\ninodes at zero,\nthose are basically just not being used.\n\n955\n00:53:26.240 --> 00:53:32.930\nNow I could come in and set a soft limit\nof something a little bit lower, right?\n\n956\n00:53:32.930 --> 00:53:33.900\nSo if I come in and\n\n957\n00:53:33.900 --> 00:53:39.430\nsay like, I'm gonna try to go to\nlike 80% of that value, there.\n\n958\n00:53:39.430 --> 00:53:44.450\nSo I'm saying if 80%, send up a warning,\nbut then when they hit 100%,\n\n959\n00:53:44.450 --> 00:53:47.950\nwhen they hit my hard That's where I'm\ngonna go ahead and just cut them off.\n\n960\n00:53:47.950 --> 00:53:49.850\nThey can't write to the disk anymore.\n\n961\n00:53:49.850 --> 00:53:50.510\nAll right?\n\n962\n00:53:50.510 --> 00:53:53.340\nSo that's the way this file\nis kinda formatted and\n\n963\n00:53:53.340 --> 00:53:56.270\nthen it just goes on to list\nthe rest of the values there.\n\n964\n00:53:56.270 --> 00:54:00.350\nSo I've got that in place and actually\ndid I drift into the wrong sitting?\n\n965\n00:54:00.350 --> 00:54:01.410\nLet me just make sure.\n\n966\n00:54:01.410 --> 00:54:02.080\nOkay, no.\n\n967\n00:54:02.080 --> 00:54:04.820\nSo I did soft and hard for the block side.\n\n968\n00:54:04.820 --> 00:54:06.190\nI didn't do it for the inodes.\n\n969\n00:54:06.190 --> 00:54:06.880\nSide so.\n\n970\n00:54:06.880 --> 00:54:11.710\nAll right, so we'll put that in place and\nwe'll save that file.\n\n971\n00:54:11.710 --> 00:54:16.940\n>> So Don, the blocks have soft and hard\nquotas and then the inodes have soft and\n\n972\n00:54:16.940 --> 00:54:19.580\nhard quotas and we're just not seeing\nit because of that word wrap right?\n\n973\n00:54:19.580 --> 00:54:22.740\n>> Yeah, yeah, it just kind of\nscrolls of there, it gets hard to see.\n\n974\n00:54:22.740 --> 00:54:26.600\nAnd I used really big numbers so you know\nthat makes it Add more to it, so, alright!\n\n975\n00:54:26.600 --> 00:54:30.130\nSo, I'm just going to rerun the quota\ncheck just to reach through.\n\n976\n00:54:30.130 --> 00:54:34.650\nJust so it can scan and now it recognizes\nthe new limits and it puts them in place.\n\n977\n00:54:34.650 --> 00:54:38.660\nSo, the quotas are there,\nwe've assigned the quotas and\n\n978\n00:54:38.660 --> 00:54:40.260\nnow we just need to turn them on.\n\n979\n00:54:40.260 --> 00:54:43.730\nAnd you've got, well actually\nthey should be on at this point.\n\n980\n00:54:43.730 --> 00:54:45.920\nThe newer versions of Linux\nturn it on by default.\n\n981\n00:54:45.920 --> 00:54:50.520\nThere's the quota on and\nquota off commands, quota on and\n\n982\n00:54:50.520 --> 00:54:53.850\nquota off, and\nthey're actually both kind of redundant.\n\n983\n00:54:53.850 --> 00:54:56.590\nBut, what they do is they allow\nyou to turn the quotas on and\n\n984\n00:54:56.590 --> 00:54:58.320\noff if you're having problems.\n\n985\n00:54:58.320 --> 00:55:01.560\nAnd you wanna troubleshoot it you can\nquickly turn all the quotas off and\n\n986\n00:55:01.560 --> 00:55:03.350\nturn them back on again.\n\n987\n00:55:03.350 --> 00:55:06.170\nBut you know most of our modern versions\nof Linux will turn the quotas on by\n\n988\n00:55:06.170 --> 00:55:12.102\ndefault we don't necessarily have to do,\nbut you can and you can say quotaon -a and\n\n989\n00:55:12.102 --> 00:55:16.900\nthat will turn on all your quotas so\nnow they're on.\n\n990\n00:55:16.900 --> 00:55:20.280\nI'm not getting any feedback because Well,\nthey're probably already on.\n\n991\n00:55:20.280 --> 00:55:21.990\nOr we can say quota off dash a and\n\n992\n00:55:21.990 --> 00:55:25.750\nthat'll turn them all off, so\na couple of ways to manipulate that.\n\n993\n00:55:25.750 --> 00:55:28.100\nYou can also turn them on and\noff per user.\n\n994\n00:55:28.100 --> 00:55:31.290\nSo, maybe I have a user that's\nin violation and I've got a hard\n\n995\n00:55:31.290 --> 00:55:34.380\nquota on them and they call down and\nthey say look, it's the end of the month,\n\n996\n00:55:34.380 --> 00:55:37.960\nI got to get these reports out, can you\ngive me a little more space for today?\n\n997\n00:55:37.960 --> 00:55:42.100\nThen tomorrow I'll come in and\ndelete stuff, I promise.\n\n998\n00:55:42.100 --> 00:55:47.620\nRight?\nSo, you could say \"quotaoff-udpezet\" and\n\n999\n00:55:47.620 --> 00:55:49.360\nturn it off just for that user.\n\n1000\n00:55:50.760 --> 00:55:54.500\nAnd then they can go and\nthey can work, and let's see.\n\n1001\n00:55:54.500 --> 00:55:56.488\nCan not stat given mount,\nI didn't provide a mountpoint.\n\n1002\n00:55:56.488 --> 00:56:03.929\nI have to tell them which mountpoint\nI'm talking about, /Storage.\n\n1003\n00:56:03.929 --> 00:56:06.049\nAnd no switch file,\ndo I have it backwards?\n\n1004\n00:56:06.049 --> 00:56:07.249\nI have my syntax backwards.\n\n1005\n00:56:07.249 --> 00:56:11.069\nLet me just check Quotaon, quotaoff.\n\n1006\n00:56:14.388 --> 00:56:15.348\nLet me check my syntax.\n\n1007\n00:56:19.734 --> 00:56:24.634\nUser group.\n\n1008\n00:56:24.634 --> 00:56:25.254\nHm.\n\n1009\n00:56:31.802 --> 00:56:33.958\nIt might be the fact that I\nhaven't created any files yet, so\n\n1010\n00:56:33.958 --> 00:56:35.450\nit doesn't have anything to update yet.\n\n1011\n00:56:35.450 --> 00:56:39.120\nYeah, I created some stuff under root but\nnot under dpezet.\n\n1012\n00:56:39.120 --> 00:56:41.560\nLet me just turn that one back on for\ndpezet,\n\n1013\n00:56:41.560 --> 00:56:45.300\nalthough it might just get\nangry at me there, too.\n\n1014\n00:56:45.300 --> 00:56:46.150\nYeah.\n\n1015\n00:56:46.150 --> 00:56:46.860\nAll right.\n\n1016\n00:56:46.860 --> 00:56:48.530\nI'm gonna make sure that\nI turn it all back on.\n\n1017\n00:56:48.530 --> 00:56:50.420\nI haven't created any\nfiles with that user.\n\n1018\n00:56:50.420 --> 00:56:52.240\nThat's likely what's angry about.\n\n1019\n00:56:52.240 --> 00:56:53.868\nBut, I do have my entries.\n\n1020\n00:56:53.868 --> 00:56:57.428\nSo, it should be happy enough.\n\n1021\n00:57:00.868 --> 00:57:02.889\nDevice or resource busy, nice\n\n1022\n00:57:07.658 --> 00:57:11.400\nLet's make sure it's still mounted and\nI can get in there, yeah, all right.\n\n1023\n00:57:11.400 --> 00:57:15.330\nSo basically it's just updating this\nlittle aquota.user and aquota.group files.\n\n1024\n00:57:15.330 --> 00:57:16.790\nSo I can see those that are right here and\n\n1025\n00:57:16.790 --> 00:57:21.200\nyou can actually look at them\nif I do more aquota.user.\n\n1026\n00:57:21.200 --> 00:57:23.910\nIt will come in here, but\nit is basically a binary file.\n\n1027\n00:57:23.910 --> 00:57:29.580\nSo see how I just see a couple little like\nsquare blocks, not seeing much in there,\n\n1028\n00:57:29.580 --> 00:57:32.150\nand not able to spell group.\n\n1029\n00:57:32.150 --> 00:57:37.320\nSo, you just kind of see junk in there\nversus when you use edquota, that's when\n\n1030\n00:57:37.320 --> 00:57:40.660\nyou actually get in there and you're able\nto see the values that are tied to it.\n\n1031\n00:57:40.660 --> 00:57:42.188\nSo, edquota, pretty important one.\n\n1032\n00:57:42.188 --> 00:57:42.983\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1033\n00:57:42.983 --> 00:57:44.260\n>> All right.\n\n1034\n00:57:44.260 --> 00:57:46.800\nSo now the quotas are in place,\nnow the users are limited.\n\n1035\n00:57:46.800 --> 00:57:47.970\nWhen they start working and\n\n1036\n00:57:47.970 --> 00:57:53.110\ncopying data in there, they're gonna hit\nthat limit and they'll be restricted.\n\n1037\n00:57:53.110 --> 00:57:54.630\nSo a pretty useful thing.\n\n1038\n00:57:54.630 --> 00:57:57.570\nI'll be honest with you, a lot of\ncompanies don't use this anymore, and\n\n1039\n00:57:57.570 --> 00:58:01.350\nthe main reason is because storage\nhas become very cheap, and\n\n1040\n00:58:01.350 --> 00:58:04.290\nyou don't wanna stop people\nfrom being able to work.\n\n1041\n00:58:04.290 --> 00:58:06.330\nAnd so, when we do use them,\nmore often than not,\n\n1042\n00:58:06.330 --> 00:58:11.110\nwe're using soft quotas instead of hard\nquotas, just so we send up a red flag.\n\n1043\n00:58:11.110 --> 00:58:15.665\nAnother thing that we do is,\nwhen we start running low on space.\n\n1044\n00:58:15.665 --> 00:58:19.615\nAt that time, we run a scan to see who\nhas the ownership of the most files, and\n\n1045\n00:58:19.615 --> 00:58:21.465\nyou can use the du command to do that.\n\n1046\n00:58:21.465 --> 00:58:22.775\nAnd then you have filter by owner and\n\n1047\n00:58:22.775 --> 00:58:25.735\nstuff, so different ways to go\nabout finding that information.\n\n1048\n00:58:25.735 --> 00:58:30.295\nBut that's the quota system, it used\nto be a heck of a lot harder, right?\n\n1049\n00:58:30.295 --> 00:58:33.787\nI know, I had a problem here but\nit used to be way harder.\n\n1050\n00:58:33.787 --> 00:58:36.915\nThe edquota command really\nmade life a lot easier now.\n\n1051\n00:58:36.915 --> 00:58:40.030\nBecause when you wanna manipulate one\nuser's quota, you don't have to go and\n\n1052\n00:58:40.030 --> 00:58:42.890\nhunt for all the folders, you don't\nhave to go and hunt for that user.\n\n1053\n00:58:42.890 --> 00:58:45.780\nYou just do edquota, and\nthe user name, or edquota -g and\n\n1054\n00:58:45.780 --> 00:58:47.850\nthe group name, and there you go.\n\n1055\n00:58:47.850 --> 00:58:50.380\nYou get their settings, you modify them,\nand you're in business.\n\n1056\n00:58:50.380 --> 00:58:50.880\n>> Very nice.\n\n1057\n00:58:52.210 --> 00:58:54.960\n>> So that is basically the quota system.\n\n1058\n00:58:54.960 --> 00:58:58.920\nNow, I talked about users and groups.\n\n1059\n00:58:58.920 --> 00:59:01.440\nAnd we haven't really looked at them yet,\nright?\n\n1060\n00:59:01.440 --> 00:59:04.200\nAnd, we've got a security episode that's\ngonna be filmed next week that'll\n\n1061\n00:59:04.200 --> 00:59:05.310\ncover all of those.\n\n1062\n00:59:05.310 --> 00:59:09.220\nBut it really comes down to\nthings like permissions, right?\n\n1063\n00:59:09.220 --> 00:59:12.530\nWhich was my first thought of that problem\na moment ago cuz I'm logged in as root.\n\n1064\n00:59:12.530 --> 00:59:13.970\nI should have everything.\n\n1065\n00:59:13.970 --> 00:59:18.290\nBut we set permissions right\non our files and folders and\n\n1066\n00:59:18.290 --> 00:59:22.480\nright on our data to protect\nwho has that access.\n\n1067\n00:59:22.480 --> 00:59:25.990\nAnd we need to talk about that cuz you've\ngotta have a good understanding of how\n\n1068\n00:59:25.990 --> 00:59:28.860\nfile permissions work\nbefore you take the exam.\n\n1069\n00:59:28.860 --> 00:59:31.510\nAnd really before you use Linux in\nthe real world cuz it is important.\n\n1070\n00:59:32.540 --> 00:59:33.850\nEvery file and\n\n1071\n00:59:33.850 --> 00:59:38.650\nevery folder throughout every file\nsystem in Linux has permissions, okay?\n\n1072\n00:59:38.650 --> 00:59:42.630\nIt's not like in the Windows world\nwhere in NTFS you have permissions, but\n\n1073\n00:59:42.630 --> 00:59:44.670\nin FAT32 you don't, or whatever.\n\n1074\n00:59:44.670 --> 00:59:49.750\nIn all the exts, ext2, 3,\n4, you've got permissions.\n\n1075\n00:59:49.750 --> 00:59:51.750\nAnd the permissions\nare actually really simple.\n\n1076\n00:59:51.750 --> 00:59:56.460\nThey work on the concept of assigning\naccess rights to three different things.\n\n1077\n00:59:56.460 --> 01:00:01.230\nTo the owner, whoever it is that\ncreated the document or folder.\n\n1078\n01:00:01.230 --> 01:00:05.500\nThe group, so whatever group of\npeople it is that should have access.\n\n1079\n01:00:05.500 --> 01:00:07.200\nAnd then everyone else.\n\n1080\n01:00:07.200 --> 01:00:10.090\nThose are our three categories of\nhow those permissions are assigned.\n\n1081\n01:00:11.260 --> 01:00:12.700\nAnd when we assign the permissions,\n\n1082\n01:00:12.700 --> 01:00:15.330\nthere's really only three main\npermissions we worry about.\n\n1083\n01:00:15.330 --> 01:00:18.340\nRead, write, and execute.\n\n1084\n01:00:18.340 --> 01:00:20.590\nRead means you can open the file and\nlook at it.\n\n1085\n01:00:20.590 --> 01:00:23.030\nWrite means you can make changes to it and\nsave it.\n\n1086\n01:00:23.030 --> 01:00:27.340\nAnd execute means if it's a program or\nscript, you can run it, all right.\n\n1087\n01:00:27.340 --> 01:00:31.070\nSo we grant those\npermissions to the owner, or\n\n1088\n01:00:31.070 --> 01:00:33.910\nwe grant those permissions\nto a group of people, or\n\n1089\n01:00:33.910 --> 01:00:38.130\nwe grant those permissions to everyone,\nor we take those permissions away.\n\n1090\n01:00:38.130 --> 01:00:41.090\nAnd so we need to understand\nhow the permissions work, so\n\n1091\n01:00:41.090 --> 01:00:42.750\nwe can manipulate that access.\n\n1092\n01:00:42.750 --> 01:00:46.340\nYou never wanna give someone more\npermissions than they actually need.\n\n1093\n01:00:46.340 --> 01:00:49.610\nYou don't want somebody going\ncrazy on your system and\n\n1094\n01:00:49.610 --> 01:00:51.800\naccidentally deleting\nentire directories or\n\n1095\n01:00:51.800 --> 01:00:56.410\nwhatever, we can use our file permissions\nto protect from that, all right.\n\n1096\n01:00:56.410 --> 01:01:00.420\nNow the way that Linux represents\nthese file permissions is a little bit\n\n1097\n01:01:00.420 --> 01:01:01.760\nweird, all right.\n\n1098\n01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:04.890\nAnd it's one of those things that's\ngotten easier over the years.\n\n1099\n01:01:04.890 --> 01:01:07.220\nBut the way it represents them is strange.\n\n1100\n01:01:07.220 --> 01:01:09.480\nIf we take a look at some files, so\n\n1101\n01:01:09.480 --> 01:01:13.250\nI'm just gonna do an ls -la\non this folder, all right?\n\n1102\n01:01:13.250 --> 01:01:18.240\nWhat we see is most of what we\nneed listed right over here on\n\n1103\n01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:22.630\nthe left side of the screen when we do the\nlong form of a directory listing, okay?\n\n1104\n01:01:22.630 --> 01:01:25.550\nRight across here, I see my permissions.\n\n1105\n01:01:25.550 --> 01:01:30.670\nThere's actually, what, 11 values here and\nit's the middle nine that are important.\n\n1106\n01:01:30.670 --> 01:01:33.490\nThe first one here just shows\nwhether we're a directory or not.\n\n1107\n01:01:33.490 --> 01:01:36.740\nSo if you just see a d, it's a directory,\nif you see a dash, it's a file.\n\n1108\n01:01:36.740 --> 01:01:39.550\nThe next nine are the permissions,\nall right?\n\n1109\n01:01:39.550 --> 01:01:42.620\nPermission one, two and\nthree, that's the owner.\n\n1110\n01:01:42.620 --> 01:01:47.730\nWhoever created this file,\nthat's who those permissions apply to.\n\n1111\n01:01:47.730 --> 01:01:51.000\nThe next three,\nwhich would be what four, five, and\n\n1112\n01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:54.140\nsix, those three apply to the group.\n\n1113\n01:01:54.140 --> 01:01:56.290\nWhatever group is attached to that file.\n\n1114\n01:01:56.290 --> 01:02:00.400\nAnd then the last three, one, two,\nthree would be what, seven, eight, nine.\n\n1115\n01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:05.469\nThose three apply to everybody, everybody\nwho accesses that file, all right?\n\n1116\n01:02:05.469 --> 01:02:07.380\nNow who is the owner?\n\n1117\n01:02:07.380 --> 01:02:10.720\nI just have to look at couple of\ncolumns over here's the owner.\n\n1118\n01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:13.750\nHere's the person that created that file.\n\n1119\n01:02:13.750 --> 01:02:14.370\nAnd who's the group?\n\n1120\n01:02:14.370 --> 01:02:16.520\nWell that's the next thing,\nhere's the group.\n\n1121\n01:02:16.520 --> 01:02:20.700\nWhen you create a user account, so\nlike I created a dpezet user account.\n\n1122\n01:02:20.700 --> 01:02:24.930\nThe typical thing we do is create\na group called dpezet also.\n\n1123\n01:02:24.930 --> 01:02:29.150\nAnd then that way, when I create a file or\n\n1124\n01:02:29.150 --> 01:02:31.970\nwhatever, the user is dpezet,\nthe group is dpezet.\n\n1125\n01:02:31.970 --> 01:02:34.290\nThat means I'm the only\none who has access to it.\n\n1126\n01:02:34.290 --> 01:02:35.640\nThere really is no group.\n\n1127\n01:02:35.640 --> 01:02:37.830\nBut we may choose to go and\ncreate a group.\n\n1128\n01:02:37.830 --> 01:02:41.400\nCreate a group called marketing or\nsales or whatever.\n\n1129\n01:02:41.400 --> 01:02:45.350\nAnd so I can attach these files or\nfolders to the marketing group.\n\n1130\n01:02:45.350 --> 01:02:48.570\nSo I might be the one who created it,\nbut I work for\n\n1131\n01:02:48.570 --> 01:02:51.330\nthe marketing department, so the file\ngets attached to the marketing group and\n\n1132\n01:02:51.330 --> 01:02:53.330\nthat's who has access to the file, right?\n\n1133\n01:02:53.330 --> 01:02:55.540\nAnd then we can set different permissions.\n\n1134\n01:02:55.540 --> 01:02:57.750\nNotice some of these files like,\n\n1135\n01:02:57.750 --> 01:03:02.420\nwell like those quota files, I can see as\nthe root user, I get read and write, and\n\n1136\n01:03:02.420 --> 01:03:05.360\nI'm running as root so\nthe system would see this, too.\n\n1137\n01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:08.630\nEverybody else can't even see the file,\nright?\n\n1138\n01:03:08.630 --> 01:03:14.770\nIf I were to switch over\nto my personal account and\n\n1139\n01:03:14.770 --> 01:03:19.400\nchange into /mnt/Storage and\ndo an ls -la, right?\n\n1140\n01:03:19.400 --> 01:03:22.410\nI see all these files owned by root, okay?\n\n1141\n01:03:22.410 --> 01:03:23.548\nAnd if I.\n\n1142\n01:03:26.575 --> 01:03:33.605\nI'm gonna copy the VMwareTools to here,\nand I'll call it Video5.mp4, okay?\n\n1143\n01:03:33.605 --> 01:03:37.730\nSo I'm gonna create another video in here,\nand when I try and\n\n1144\n01:03:37.730 --> 01:03:40.510\ndo it I get permission denied, okay?\n\n1145\n01:03:40.510 --> 01:03:45.530\nI was not able to copy data\nto this folder, all right?\n\n1146\n01:03:45.530 --> 01:03:46.330\nWhy not?\n\n1147\n01:03:46.330 --> 01:03:50.659\nWell, it's because of the folder itself,\n/mnt/Storage.\n\n1148\n01:03:50.659 --> 01:03:52.827\nI'm not the one who made it, okay?\n\n1149\n01:03:52.827 --> 01:03:58.098\nIn my own directory,\nif I take a look in my home directory.\n\n1150\n01:03:58.098 --> 01:04:02.468\nI can look in here, and I can see the\npermissions assigned in my home directory.\n\n1151\n01:04:02.468 --> 01:04:07.346\nNotice that root has access\nto the directory above me.\n\n1152\n01:04:07.346 --> 01:04:09.288\nThat would be /home right?\n\n1153\n01:04:09.288 --> 01:04:14.730\nBut /home/dpezet,\nI am the creator and group.\n\n1154\n01:04:14.730 --> 01:04:18.005\nAnd I've got full access\nto all of this stuff.\n\n1155\n01:04:18.005 --> 01:04:24.565\nIf I do the same thing,\nbut against /mnt/Storage,\n\n1156\n01:04:24.565 --> 01:04:30.000\nright there, I can see how root is the one\nwho is in charge of all of that stuff.\n\n1157\n01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:33.210\nOkay and that's why I can't go and\ncreate anything in there.\n\n1158\n01:04:33.210 --> 01:04:38.700\nIf I look at dot, dot is that storage\ndirectory, root is the one attached to it.\n\n1159\n01:04:38.700 --> 01:04:43.210\nAnd I look at the permissions,\nthe owner has read, write, execute.\n\n1160\n01:04:43.210 --> 01:04:44.160\nThe owner can do whatever they want.\n\n1161\n01:04:45.500 --> 01:04:49.620\nThe group, which is also root,\nhas read and execute, all right?\n\n1162\n01:04:49.620 --> 01:04:54.080\nAnd then everyone else, which would\ninclude dpezet, just has read and execute.\n\n1163\n01:04:54.080 --> 01:04:55.780\nSo I can read that directory,\n\n1164\n01:04:55.780 --> 01:04:58.840\nI can navigate into it which is\nexactly what I've done here.\n\n1165\n01:04:58.840 --> 01:05:01.050\nMy present working directory is that.\n\n1166\n01:05:01.050 --> 01:05:04.710\nI can pull up the directory list,\nI can look around,\n\n1167\n01:05:04.710 --> 01:05:06.060\nI can watch these videos, right?\n\n1168\n01:05:06.060 --> 01:05:08.160\nIf there was a script I could execute it.\n\n1169\n01:05:08.160 --> 01:05:12.448\nBut I don't have write permissions and so\nI can't change anything in there, right?\n\n1170\n01:05:12.448 --> 01:05:18.158\nSo that's what all these rwx's\nare off here to the side, okay?\n\n1171\n01:05:18.158 --> 01:05:22.318\nNow we're gonna cover creating users,\ncreating groups in the security episode\n\n1172\n01:05:22.318 --> 01:05:24.519\nbut as far as assigning\nthe permissions and\n\n1173\n01:05:24.519 --> 01:05:27.820\nassigning the owner,\nthat's actually pretty easy.\n\n1174\n01:05:27.820 --> 01:05:32.788\nWe've got a couple of different\ncommands that let us do that,\n\n1175\n01:05:32.788 --> 01:05:34.840\nC-H-O-W-N, chown, right?\n\n1176\n01:05:34.840 --> 01:05:38.240\nThat is the change owner command.\n\n1177\n01:05:38.240 --> 01:05:42.440\nAnd we can change the owner of any file or\nany folder, right?\n\n1178\n01:05:42.440 --> 01:05:45.910\nWe also have the chgrp,\n\n1179\n01:05:45.910 --> 01:05:50.935\nwhich will let us change the group\nthat's attached to a file or folder.\n\n1180\n01:05:50.935 --> 01:05:54.465\nBut you can actually do it\nat the same time with chown.\n\n1181\n01:05:54.465 --> 01:05:56.145\nSo I normally just use that one command.\n\n1182\n01:05:56.145 --> 01:05:57.885\nBut there is a chgrp for\n\n1183\n01:05:57.885 --> 01:06:02.655\nchanging the group attached to a file or\nfolder, all right?\n\n1184\n01:06:02.655 --> 01:06:07.730\nAnd then to change permissions,\nthere's chmod.\n\n1185\n01:06:07.730 --> 01:06:10.870\nWe can modify the permissions with chmod,\n\n1186\n01:06:10.870 --> 01:06:13.718\nthis guy right here,\nto change the permissions on a file, okay?\n\n1187\n01:06:14.870 --> 01:06:17.820\nThose are the three main commands that\nwe use when it comes to manipulating\n\n1188\n01:06:17.820 --> 01:06:18.530\nthese files.\n\n1189\n01:06:18.530 --> 01:06:20.749\nchown, for changing the owner.\n\n1190\n01:06:20.749 --> 01:06:23.428\nAnd you can do the group at the same time.\n\n1191\n01:06:23.428 --> 01:06:25.570\nchgrp for changing the group.\n\n1192\n01:06:25.570 --> 01:06:30.130\nAnd chmod for\nchanging the permissions, all right?\n\n1193\n01:06:30.130 --> 01:06:31.860\nSo let's take a look at some of these.\n\n1194\n01:06:31.860 --> 01:06:35.700\nI'm gonna switch back to my root,\nall right?\n\n1195\n01:06:35.700 --> 01:06:39.758\nSo here I am back as my root,\nand I'm in Storage, right?\n\n1196\n01:06:39.758 --> 01:06:43.856\nAnd notice that test folder right there,\nif I look at the test folder,\n\n1197\n01:06:43.856 --> 01:06:45.598\nit's owned by root, right?\n\n1198\n01:06:45.598 --> 01:06:48.720\nAnd that's it,\nI'm not letting anybody else in there.\n\n1199\n01:06:48.720 --> 01:06:52.150\nI'm gonna make a test2 directory,\nall right?\n\n1200\n01:06:54.790 --> 01:06:57.340\nSo now I've got test and test2.\n\n1201\n01:06:57.340 --> 01:07:01.594\nAnd they've got the same effective\npermissions on them, as root, I can read,\n\n1202\n01:07:01.594 --> 01:07:02.710\nwrite and execute.\n\n1203\n01:07:02.710 --> 01:07:04.050\nEverybody else can only read and\nexecute, all right?\n\n1204\n01:07:05.700 --> 01:07:11.082\nBut what I'm gonna do\nis I'm gonna use chown,\n\n1205\n01:07:11.082 --> 01:07:16.420\nI'm gonna change the owner of that test2.\n\n1206\n01:07:16.420 --> 01:07:21.138\nSo, I'm gonna change\nthe owner of test2 to dpezet.\n\n1207\n01:07:24.569 --> 01:07:25.509\nLike that.\n\n1208\n01:07:25.509 --> 01:07:30.434\nSo, chown, and then whoever that owner is,\nand I'm gonna make it dpezet, and\n\n1209\n01:07:30.434 --> 01:07:33.140\nthen the directory I wanna change.\n\n1210\n01:07:33.140 --> 01:07:34.070\nOkay, so I'm doing test2.\n\n1211\n01:07:34.070 --> 01:07:37.170\nNow, I said the directory,\nyou can do this to a file, also, right?\n\n1212\n01:07:37.170 --> 01:07:38.035\nI'm just doing that directory.\n\n1213\n01:07:40.720 --> 01:07:44.440\nNow if I pull up my directory listing,\nI can see that test2 is owned by dpezet.\n\n1214\n01:07:44.440 --> 01:07:46.758\nThe group is still set to root though.\n\n1215\n01:07:46.758 --> 01:07:48.804\nSo dpezet will be able to get in there,\nright?\n\n1216\n01:07:48.804 --> 01:07:53.050\nAnd I'll see that dpezet has read,\nwrite, and execute.\n\n1217\n01:07:53.050 --> 01:07:55.160\nBut root is still the group.\n\n1218\n01:07:55.160 --> 01:07:57.460\nSo if I wanna change the group also,\nI can do that.\n\n1219\n01:07:57.460 --> 01:08:01.255\nIt's really the same command,\nexcept instead of chown, we say chgrp.\n\n1220\n01:08:02.860 --> 01:08:07.377\nAnd now,\nI'll see that the group is dpezet also.\n\n1221\n01:08:08.400 --> 01:08:11.690\nOkay, now I did say we could do it\nat the same time with one command.\n\n1222\n01:08:11.690 --> 01:08:15.600\nAnd this is how I normally do it,\nwhich is chown and\n\n1223\n01:08:15.600 --> 01:08:21.070\nthen you can do the user name,\ncolon, and the group name.\n\n1224\n01:08:21.070 --> 01:08:24.300\nAnd then what is you wanna change, right?\n\n1225\n01:08:24.300 --> 01:08:28.440\nSo by saying that, root colon root,\nI'm changing the user and\n\n1226\n01:08:28.440 --> 01:08:31.110\nthe group to root for test2.\n\n1227\n01:08:31.110 --> 01:08:34.640\nAnd when I look, I can see they've\nboth gone back to root and\n\n1228\n01:08:34.640 --> 01:08:41.530\nI can change it right back\nagain to dpezet:dpezet,\n\n1229\n01:08:41.530 --> 01:08:44.860\nand all done in one fell swoop.\n\n1230\n01:08:44.860 --> 01:08:48.050\nThat's kind of what I'm in the habit of,\nI can't remember the last time,\n\n1231\n01:08:48.050 --> 01:08:50.380\nin fact this time right here I ran chgrp,\n\n1232\n01:08:50.380 --> 01:08:53.520\nthat's probably the first time I've\nrun it in at least, I don't know.\n\n1233\n01:08:53.520 --> 01:08:54.950\nProbably seven or eight years.\n\n1234\n01:08:54.950 --> 01:08:58.448\nIt's just not something I use cuz chown,\nchange owner, can do it.\n\n1235\n01:08:58.448 --> 01:09:02.381\nBut if you just wanna change the group and\nyou don't know who the current owner is,\n\n1236\n01:09:02.381 --> 01:09:05.697\nyou don't wanna go find out,\nthen chgrp can be kinda handy for that.\n\n1237\n01:09:05.697 --> 01:09:08.856\nAll right, so now dpezet, right?\n\n1238\n01:09:08.856 --> 01:09:11.120\nI, let me switch back over to dpezet.\n\n1239\n01:09:11.120 --> 01:09:13.828\nSo here I am as dpezet.\n\n1240\n01:09:13.828 --> 01:09:18.532\nAnd if I change into /mnt/Storage/test,\n\n1241\n01:09:18.532 --> 01:09:22.256\nand I try and create a file, right?\n\n1242\n01:09:22.256 --> 01:09:24.736\nI get Permission denied.\n\n1243\n01:09:24.736 --> 01:09:29.304\nBut if I change into test2, and try and\n\n1244\n01:09:29.304 --> 01:09:33.328\ncreate a file, I can do it, okay?\n\n1245\n01:09:33.328 --> 01:09:39.120\nI can do it because I have read,\nwrite, and execute permissions.\n\n1246\n01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:41.630\nNow I didn't actually assign permissions,\nI just changed the owner.\n\n1247\n01:09:41.630 --> 01:09:44.700\nI made myself the owner of this file,\nall right?\n\n1248\n01:09:44.700 --> 01:09:46.400\nSo I'm now the one who's responsible for\nit.\n\n1249\n01:09:46.400 --> 01:09:47.270\nI can delete it,\n\n1250\n01:09:47.270 --> 01:09:52.450\nI can do whatever I want because I'm\nlisted as the owner of it, right?\n\n1251\n01:09:52.450 --> 01:09:57.260\nAnd of test,\nwhich is listed here as dot, right?\n\n1252\n01:09:57.260 --> 01:09:59.548\nA single dot, that's the folder I'm in,\nI am the owner.\n\n1253\n01:09:59.548 --> 01:10:01.572\nThe parent folder though,\n\n1254\n01:10:01.572 --> 01:10:05.356\n/mnt/Storage/root is still the owner,\nokay?\n\n1255\n01:10:05.356 --> 01:10:09.055\nSo one way that we can give somebody\naccess to a file is to change\n\n1256\n01:10:09.055 --> 01:10:10.250\nthe ownership.\n\n1257\n01:10:10.250 --> 01:10:13.170\nWe can make them the owner of it, then\nthey can do whatever they want, right?\n\n1258\n01:10:13.170 --> 01:10:14.940\nBut what if we don't want\nthem to be the owner?\n\n1259\n01:10:14.940 --> 01:10:16.340\nWhat if we just want them to have access?\n\n1260\n01:10:16.340 --> 01:10:19.740\nWe want them to be able to get in\nthere and modify some things, okay?\n\n1261\n01:10:19.740 --> 01:10:22.150\nWell, we could put them in\na group that gave them access.\n\n1262\n01:10:22.150 --> 01:10:22.990\nThat's one way to do it.\n\n1263\n01:10:22.990 --> 01:10:26.730\nAnd we'll see group assignments\nwhen we do user account creation.\n\n1264\n01:10:26.730 --> 01:10:30.130\nThe other way though is I can change\nthe permissions for everybody, and\n\n1265\n01:10:30.130 --> 01:10:32.980\nI can give everybody that access to be\nable to get in there and make changes.\n\n1266\n01:10:32.980 --> 01:10:37.400\nSo maybe I have an uploads folder and\nI want people to be able to upload data in\n\n1267\n01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:41.740\nthere even if they're not the owner or\nin a group that has access to it, okay?\n\n1268\n01:10:41.740 --> 01:10:44.840\nWe can change file permissions to do that.\n\n1269\n01:10:44.840 --> 01:10:46.760\nNow, before I get into\nchanging file permissions,\n\n1270\n01:10:46.760 --> 01:10:49.670\nI wanna talk a little about where\nthe defaults come from, right?\n\n1271\n01:10:49.670 --> 01:10:52.400\nBecause if I'm root and I come in here and\n\n1272\n01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:56.710\nI create a directory called uploads,\nright?\n\n1273\n01:10:56.710 --> 01:10:59.350\nWell, when I created uploads,\n\n1274\n01:10:59.350 --> 01:11:03.320\nit automatically made me the owner\nbecause I'm the one who did, right?\n\n1275\n01:11:03.320 --> 01:11:04.580\nThat makes sense.\n\n1276\n01:11:04.580 --> 01:11:07.640\nBut what about these default permissions,\ngiving me read, write, and\n\n1277\n01:11:07.640 --> 01:11:10.650\nexecute, and\neverybody else just read and execute.\n\n1278\n01:11:10.650 --> 01:11:12.210\nWhere did that come from?\n\n1279\n01:11:12.210 --> 01:11:13.760\nWell those are default permissions.\n\n1280\n01:11:13.760 --> 01:11:17.030\nWe define them in our system\nthrough a slightly weird command.\n\n1281\n01:11:17.030 --> 01:11:18.390\nWe'll get a chance to see it.\n\n1282\n01:11:18.390 --> 01:11:20.540\nWell, looking at the clock\nwe're kinda short on time.\n\n1283\n01:11:20.540 --> 01:11:24.030\nLet's do this Ronnie, let's stop here and\ntake a break, and when we get back,\n\n1284\n01:11:24.030 --> 01:11:26.840\nI wanna show you guys how to\nset the default permissions.\n\n1285\n01:11:26.840 --> 01:11:28.100\nSo, what a file will start with.\n\n1286\n01:11:28.100 --> 01:11:31.200\nAnd then I'll show you how to\nmanipulate the permissions so\n\n1287\n01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:32.890\nthat we can give other people access.\n\n1288\n01:11:32.890 --> 01:11:33.850\n>> Sounds good.\n\n1289\n01:11:33.850 --> 01:11:37.635\n>> All right, so stay tuned, when we\nget back, we are permitted to continue.\n\n1290\n01:11:37.635 --> 01:11:39.048\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'm very witty today.\n\n1291\n01:11:39.048 --> 01:11:40.548\nStay tuned, we'll be back in a few.\n\n1292\n01:11:40.548 --> 01:11:44.412\n[MUSIC]\n\n1293\n01:11:47.968 --> 01:11:49.669\nAll right, welcome back everybody.\n\n1294\n01:11:49.669 --> 01:11:54.018\nSo before the break,\nI started talking about permissions, okay?\n\n1295\n01:11:54.018 --> 01:11:58.554\nAnd the way that permissions are written\nout is a little strange, and so I wanna\n\n1296\n01:11:58.554 --> 01:12:03.023\nshow you guys kinda how this works prior\nto just jumping in the command line and\n\n1297\n01:12:03.023 --> 01:12:03.658\ndoing it.\n\n1298\n01:12:03.658 --> 01:12:06.739\nSo, I jotted down some\nnotes before the show to\n\n1299\n01:12:06.739 --> 01:12:09.830\nkind of explain how\npermissions are written.\n\n1300\n01:12:09.830 --> 01:12:12.580\nAnd we've sort of already seen this,\nright.\n\n1301\n01:12:12.580 --> 01:12:16.710\nWhen we look at the permissions of a file,\nwe've got the nine characters and\n\n1302\n01:12:16.710 --> 01:12:18.555\nthey're broken up into groups of three.\n\n1303\n01:12:18.555 --> 01:12:23.390\nThere's the user, followed by the group,\nfollowed by other people,\n\n1304\n01:12:23.390 --> 01:12:25.805\nor really anybody else, right.\n\n1305\n01:12:25.805 --> 01:12:28.430\nAnd an r is read, w is write, and\n\n1306\n01:12:28.430 --> 01:12:32.448\nx is execute, a dash means they\ndon't have that permission.\n\n1307\n01:12:32.448 --> 01:12:37.860\nSo r-x means you have read and\nexecute, but not write, okay.\n\n1308\n01:12:37.860 --> 01:12:39.910\nSo that's how that's\ndisplayed on the screen.\n\n1309\n01:12:39.910 --> 01:12:41.650\nAnd that's how we're used to seeing it.\n\n1310\n01:12:41.650 --> 01:12:43.326\nThat's not how it was always written.\n\n1311\n01:12:43.326 --> 01:12:46.453\nIt used to be written in\na numerical notation,\n\n1312\n01:12:46.453 --> 01:12:49.428\nthat was confusing to say the least, okay?\n\n1313\n01:12:49.428 --> 01:12:51.690\nIt used to be that instead\nof nine characters,\n\n1314\n01:12:51.690 --> 01:12:55.185\nthe whole thing was represented\nin just three characters.\n\n1315\n01:12:55.185 --> 01:12:58.045\nOne number for each person,\nor each entity.\n\n1316\n01:12:58.045 --> 01:13:01.342\nSo one number for the user, one number for\nthe group, and one number for\n\n1317\n01:13:01.342 --> 01:13:02.362\neverybody else.\n\n1318\n01:13:02.362 --> 01:13:05.792\nAnd the numbers were 0 through 7,\nand they worked out like this.\n\n1319\n01:13:05.792 --> 01:13:09.812\nIf you had a 0,\nyou had no access whatsoever.\n\n1320\n01:13:09.812 --> 01:13:16.550\nIf you had a 1, you had Execute,\na 2 was write, a 3 was write and execute.\n\n1321\n01:13:16.550 --> 01:13:21.260\nA 4 was read, a 5 was read and\nexecute, a 6 was read and write, and\n\n1322\n01:13:21.260 --> 01:13:23.310\na 7 was read, write, and execute.\n\n1323\n01:13:24.350 --> 01:13:27.830\nNow you might have noticed that the\ndefault permissions on a lot of the files\n\n1324\n01:13:27.830 --> 01:13:33.970\nthat we were looking at was rwxr-xr-x.\n\n1325\n01:13:33.970 --> 01:13:34.770\nOkay.\n\n1326\n01:13:34.770 --> 01:13:41.460\nSo a normal, a typical default\nwill look something like that.\n\n1327\n01:13:41.460 --> 01:13:42.030\nRight.\n\n1328\n01:13:42.030 --> 01:13:45.960\nAnd so it's just rwxr-xr-x.\n\n1329\n01:13:45.960 --> 01:13:48.945\nSo whoever created it,\ncan do whatever they want to it.\n\n1330\n01:13:48.945 --> 01:13:51.366\nEverybodyelse can just read and execute.\n\n1331\n01:13:51.366 --> 01:13:55.236\nIf we were to represent that numerically,\n\n1332\n01:13:55.236 --> 01:13:59.540\nthe same thing would be written 755, okay.\n\n1333\n01:13:59.540 --> 01:14:03.711\n755 means the owner,\nwhoever created it, has a 7.\n\n1334\n01:14:03.711 --> 01:14:06.100\nThey can read, write and execute.\n\n1335\n01:14:06.100 --> 01:14:07.690\nAnd then whoever the group is,\n\n1336\n01:14:07.690 --> 01:14:11.060\nand everybody else gets a 5,\nwhich is read and execute.\n\n1337\n01:14:11.060 --> 01:14:17.640\nSo rwxr-xr-x = 755.\n\n1338\n01:14:17.640 --> 01:14:22.260\nThose two are the same thing,\njust a different way of writing it.\n\n1339\n01:14:22.260 --> 01:14:26.870\nAnd so\nthat's referred to as symbolic notation.\n\n1340\n01:14:26.870 --> 01:14:28.780\nAnd the numeric notation.\n\n1341\n01:14:28.780 --> 01:14:30.370\nSymbolic is nice, cuz it's easy to read.\n\n1342\n01:14:30.370 --> 01:14:32.260\nYou don't have to kind\nof memorize anything.\n\n1343\n01:14:32.260 --> 01:14:35.070\nBut numeric, you basically have\nto memorize these numbers.\n\n1344\n01:14:35.070 --> 01:14:37.670\nIf you don't have them memorized,\nthere's not a whole lot of sense to it.\n\n1345\n01:14:37.670 --> 01:14:38.920\nI mean there sort of is.\n\n1346\n01:14:38.920 --> 01:14:41.120\n4 through 7 are the read ones.\n\n1347\n01:14:41.120 --> 01:14:45.730\nAnd you'll see, starting from 4 to 7 is\ngetting increasingly more permission.\n\n1348\n01:14:45.730 --> 01:14:47.890\nRead and Execute,\nfollowed by Read and Write.\n\n1349\n01:14:47.890 --> 01:14:48.720\nFollowed by Read, Write and Execute.\n\n1350\n01:14:48.720 --> 01:14:51.690\nAnd it's getting more and\nmore permissions, right.\n\n1351\n01:14:51.690 --> 01:14:55.490\nAnd then if we look at the other ones,\nit's again going kinda more and more.\n\n1352\n01:14:55.490 --> 01:14:59.570\nSo none to execute to write, to write and\nexecute, but none of those actually\n\n1353\n01:14:59.570 --> 01:15:03.230\ninclude read, which is kind of odd, so\nyou don't really see those very often.\n\n1354\n01:15:03.230 --> 01:15:04.943\nRight.\nYou don't see 1, 2, and\n\n1355\n01:15:04.943 --> 01:15:06.540\n3 very much at all, right?\n\n1356\n01:15:06.540 --> 01:15:11.130\nIn fact, common things that you'll\nsee will be things like 500.\n\n1357\n01:15:11.130 --> 01:15:14.910\n500 means the owner can read and\nexecute, everybody else has nothing.\n\n1358\n01:15:14.910 --> 01:15:16.280\nThey can't get to that stuff at all.\n\n1359\n01:15:16.280 --> 01:15:17.970\nRight.\nSo that's not an uncommon one.\n\n1360\n01:15:17.970 --> 01:15:21.900\nIt's a heck of a lot easier to\nrepresent that symbolically, but for\n\n1361\n01:15:21.900 --> 01:15:25.150\nthe exam, you could see either one, right.\n\n1362\n01:15:25.150 --> 01:15:26.260\nIt's fair game.\n\n1363\n01:15:26.260 --> 01:15:29.300\nSo you do need to be familiar\nwith both sets of notations,\n\n1364\n01:15:29.300 --> 01:15:33.280\ndon't fall into the trap of just learning\nthe symbolic one cuz it's easier,\n\n1365\n01:15:33.280 --> 01:15:34.770\nyou may need to know the numerical.\n\n1366\n01:15:36.460 --> 01:15:38.121\nSo I mentioned defaults.\n\n1367\n01:15:38.121 --> 01:15:46.064\nWell, the typical default might be\nsomething like 755 or rwxr-xr-x, right?\n\n1368\n01:15:46.064 --> 01:15:47.890\nWhere does that default come from?\n\n1369\n01:15:47.890 --> 01:15:51.280\nWell we have something called a umask.\n\n1370\n01:15:51.280 --> 01:15:56.055\nThe umask is what sets the default for\nour system and it's typically set\n\n1371\n01:15:56.055 --> 01:16:02.050\nsystem-wide in a file that's /etc/profile,\nokay.\n\n1372\n01:16:02.050 --> 01:16:05.250\nThat file is a part of our system.\n\n1373\n01:16:05.250 --> 01:16:09.980\nAnd so if I look, it's /etc/profile,\n\n1374\n01:16:09.980 --> 01:16:12.950\nyou'll see it, it actually contains\na decent bit of stuff, but\n\n1375\n01:16:12.950 --> 01:16:17.320\nif you scroll in here, somewhere in here,\nwe'll find the default umask.\n\n1376\n01:16:17.320 --> 01:16:17.820\nThere it is.\n\n1377\n01:16:19.790 --> 01:16:26.960\nSo right there I can see the umask\nof 002 for certain people.\n\n1378\n01:16:26.960 --> 01:16:29.990\nIt looks like if your user\nid is greater than 199.\n\n1379\n01:16:29.990 --> 01:16:34.680\nSo if you're a user that was added\nlater in the system, your umask is 002.\n\n1380\n01:16:34.680 --> 01:16:39.165\nOtherwise if you're a user whose uid is\nless than 199, in other words somebody\n\n1381\n01:16:39.165 --> 01:16:43.852\nwas created during the install, then your\ndefault mask would be 022, all right?\n\n1382\n01:16:43.852 --> 01:16:47.690\nNow, 002 and 022,\nthose are nothing like the stuff I was\n\n1383\n01:16:47.690 --> 01:16:50.930\ntalking about as being\ntypical a moment ago.\n\n1384\n01:16:50.930 --> 01:16:51.830\nAnd the reason is,\n\n1385\n01:16:52.940 --> 01:16:56.270\nit would be crazy to assume that we\nuse the same numerical notation for\n\n1386\n01:16:56.270 --> 01:16:59.520\numask that we use for permissions,\nright that would be crazy talk.\n\n1387\n01:16:59.520 --> 01:17:03.780\nI don't know why, but they chose to use\na completely different numerical notation.\n\n1388\n01:17:03.780 --> 01:17:07.400\nSo umask actually has its own values,\nokay.\n\n1389\n01:17:07.400 --> 01:17:09.800\n>> There you go.\n>> And 022 means something different, and\n\n1390\n01:17:09.800 --> 01:17:11.050\nin fact if you look,\n\n1391\n01:17:11.050 --> 01:17:16.210\nit's almost the exact opposite of what\nwe have with file permissions, right.\n\n1392\n01:17:16.210 --> 01:17:21.170\nRemember how with the file permission,\n0 is none and 7 is everything.\n\n1393\n01:17:21.170 --> 01:17:22.580\nLook at umask.\n\n1394\n01:17:22.580 --> 01:17:24.842\n7 is none and 0 is everything.\n\n1395\n01:17:24.842 --> 01:17:28.620\nIt's like they've flipped it on its end.\n\n1396\n01:17:28.620 --> 01:17:34.580\nSo a 022 is like a 755 in file and\nfolder permissions.\n\n1397\n01:17:34.580 --> 01:17:37.310\nSo umask values are weird.\n\n1398\n01:17:37.310 --> 01:17:38.830\nIt literally is the opposite.\n\n1399\n01:17:38.830 --> 01:17:41.070\nYou've basically flipped\nthe list upside down, and\n\n1400\n01:17:41.070 --> 01:17:44.010\nnow you have the umask side, okay.\n\n1401\n01:17:45.210 --> 01:17:47.390\nSo if you wanna see one of these.\n\n1402\n01:17:47.390 --> 01:17:51.007\nI have a simple trick I use for\nconverting them,\n\n1403\n01:17:51.007 --> 01:17:56.078\nis if I know that I've got 755 or\nwhatever I want to use, right?\n\n1404\n01:17:56.078 --> 01:17:59.847\nSo if I want 755 to be my default, and\n\n1405\n01:17:59.847 --> 01:18:03.733\nI wanna calculate the umask, what I do,\n\n1406\n01:18:03.733 --> 01:18:09.245\nis I take 755 and\nI basically subtract it from 777.\n\n1407\n01:18:09.245 --> 01:18:14.171\n777 being the highest value,\n777 minus 755 will give you your umask,\n\n1408\n01:18:14.171 --> 01:18:16.460\nwhich would be 022, right 22.\n\n1409\n01:18:16.460 --> 01:18:18.690\nSo that's my little kind of cheat method.\n\n1410\n01:18:18.690 --> 01:18:22.050\nI use that for some Cisco stuff too,\nthere's a few times that pays off.\n\n1411\n01:18:22.050 --> 01:18:25.420\nBut you could also just memorize\nthe stuff and then you don't have to do\n\n1412\n01:18:25.420 --> 01:18:29.470\nmath at all which is better for\nsomebody like me who's terrible at math.\n\n1413\n01:18:29.470 --> 01:18:31.260\nBut anyhow, that's kinda what a umask is.\n\n1414\n01:18:31.260 --> 01:18:35.590\nNow most of us never mess with umask\nbecause we're fine with the defaults.\n\n1415\n01:18:35.590 --> 01:18:39.300\nThe defaults are fine, but\nyou might want to override them and\n\n1416\n01:18:39.300 --> 01:18:43.880\nif you do, you can go into /etc/profile\nand you can change it there and\n\n1417\n01:18:43.880 --> 01:18:47.030\nyou can manipulate those defaults for\nyour entire system.\n\n1418\n01:18:47.030 --> 01:18:50.350\nNow it's not gonna affect files\nthat are already created.\n\n1419\n01:18:50.350 --> 01:18:51.900\nIt's just going to affect files and\n\n1420\n01:18:51.900 --> 01:18:55.110\nfolders created after\nyou've modified the umask.\n\n1421\n01:18:55.110 --> 01:18:56.460\nRight.\n\n1422\n01:18:56.460 --> 01:19:00.630\nThe other thing you can do, is you\ncan override it on a per user basis,\n\n1423\n01:19:00.630 --> 01:19:06.060\nevery user has their own home folder,\nand in their home folder there's\n\n1424\n01:19:06.060 --> 01:19:10.135\na hidden file called BASH RC, and it's\ngot the configuration for their shell.\n\n1425\n01:19:10.135 --> 01:19:14.460\nAnd you can go into their BASH RC file and\nyou can modify the umask in there.\n\n1426\n01:19:14.460 --> 01:19:19.670\nAnd when you do that it'll change\nthe defaults just for that user, okay.\n\n1427\n01:19:19.670 --> 01:19:24.020\nSo that's where the default permissions\ncome from, whatever that umask is defined.\n\n1428\n01:19:24.020 --> 01:19:29.350\nSo if the umask is defined as\n022 then you might see where\n\n1429\n01:19:29.350 --> 01:19:32.080\nyou have read, write and\nexecute for the owner.\n\n1430\n01:19:32.080 --> 01:19:35.490\nAnd read and execute for\neverybody else, okay.\n\n1431\n01:19:36.500 --> 01:19:38.510\nYou can also define various other ones.\n\n1432\n01:19:38.510 --> 01:19:40.860\nSo you might see different\nvariations of it.\n\n1433\n01:19:40.860 --> 01:19:45.690\nYou'll also see different variations for\nthings like files versus folders, okay.\n\n1434\n01:19:45.690 --> 01:19:49.109\nAnd so the typical umask might be 022.\n\n1435\n01:19:49.109 --> 01:19:51.743\nBut the typical file versus folder\nmight be a little different,\n\n1436\n01:19:51.743 --> 01:19:53.368\nmight be manipulated on some systems.\n\n1437\n01:19:53.368 --> 01:19:55.928\nI just threw a couple of\nother typical values there.\n\n1438\n01:19:55.928 --> 01:19:58.852\nAnd I guess it gets a little confusing\nbecause these aren't EMS values here.\n\n1439\n01:19:58.852 --> 01:20:03.535\n664 I'm talking about read and\nwrite, read and write,\n\n1440\n01:20:03.535 --> 01:20:08.873\nread for something like a file or\n775 which would be full access,\n\n1441\n01:20:08.873 --> 01:20:12.900\nfull access, and read and\nexecute for a folder.\n\n1442\n01:20:12.900 --> 01:20:16.100\nWe might change it to something like that,\nright?\n\n1443\n01:20:16.100 --> 01:20:17.741\nBut it is the umask that\ndetermines that default.\n\n1444\n01:20:17.741 --> 01:20:19.580\nThat's where they come from.\n\n1445\n01:20:19.580 --> 01:20:21.270\nNow, once a file is created, that's it.\n\n1446\n01:20:21.270 --> 01:20:22.760\nUmask doesn't apply anymore.\n\n1447\n01:20:22.760 --> 01:20:25.140\nNow we can change it to\nwhatever we want and\n\n1448\n01:20:25.140 --> 01:20:28.340\nyou can completely go against\numask if you feel like it.\n\n1449\n01:20:28.340 --> 01:20:30.860\nAll right, so how do we do that?\n\n1450\n01:20:30.860 --> 01:20:34.480\nWell before the break we talked\nabout changing ownership and\n\n1451\n01:20:34.480 --> 01:20:35.890\nchanging the group, right?\n\n1452\n01:20:35.890 --> 01:20:43.740\nChown and chgrp but we can use chmod\nto change the permissions, okay?\n\n1453\n01:20:43.740 --> 01:20:49.170\nAnd you can change the permissions\nbased on a numerical\n\n1454\n01:20:49.170 --> 01:20:55.340\nrepresentation like 755, or\nwe can change it for a user or a group.\n\n1455\n01:20:55.340 --> 01:20:57.510\nAnd the way the command\nworks is like this.\n\n1456\n01:20:57.510 --> 01:21:01.259\nIf you wanna do it for a user,\nwe say change mod u, and\n\n1457\n01:21:01.259 --> 01:21:07.310\nthen we say either plus or minus whatever\nit is we want to add or take away, right?\n\n1458\n01:21:07.310 --> 01:21:10.640\nIf we wanna take away write permissions,\nwe would say minus w, so\n\n1459\n01:21:10.640 --> 01:21:16.620\nu minus w says modify the user value and\nremove the write value.\n\n1460\n01:21:16.620 --> 01:21:21.320\nIf we say g plus r, we take whatever\nthe group permissions are, and\n\n1461\n01:21:21.320 --> 01:21:24.750\nwe add the read permissions, okay?\n\n1462\n01:21:24.750 --> 01:21:26.220\nSo really easy to add and\n\n1463\n01:21:26.220 --> 01:21:29.930\nremove those permission base on\nwhat it is that we want to do.\n\n1464\n01:21:29.930 --> 01:21:35.890\nSo going back to my server here,\nwhen I take a look at some of these,\n\n1465\n01:21:35.890 --> 01:21:40.950\nif I look at these syntax of chmod, right?\n\n1466\n01:21:40.950 --> 01:21:44.541\nWhen you look in here,\nthey give some various examples and\n\n1467\n01:21:44.541 --> 01:21:48.074\nI guess I completely breezed\npast what I was looking for.\n\n1468\n01:21:51.616 --> 01:21:56.305\nWell anyhow, so you've got U for\nuser, G for group, and\n\n1469\n01:21:56.305 --> 01:21:58.980\nO for others is the third one.\n\n1470\n01:21:58.980 --> 01:22:02.000\nAnd it's in there somewhere,\nI just glanced past it apparently.\n\n1471\n01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.510\nBut if we wanna go through and\nmodify something.\n\n1472\n01:22:04.510 --> 01:22:07.570\nSo on that folder test, right?\n\n1473\n01:22:07.570 --> 01:22:10.850\nMaybe I want to allow dpezet to\nsave some files in there, but\n\n1474\n01:22:10.850 --> 01:22:12.350\nI don't wanna make dpezet the owner.\n\n1475\n01:22:12.350 --> 01:22:15.130\nIn fact, I don't even wanna put\ndpezet in a group to do it.\n\n1476\n01:22:15.130 --> 01:22:18.950\nI wanna make it where you know, I forgot\nabout the uploads folder we created.\n\n1477\n01:22:18.950 --> 01:22:21.970\nI wanna make it where everybody can\nupload to the uploads folder, right?\n\n1478\n01:22:21.970 --> 01:22:23.290\nThat's what I want.\n\n1479\n01:22:23.290 --> 01:22:26.470\nWell, right now,\nthe uploads folder is basically 755.\n\n1480\n01:22:26.470 --> 01:22:31.250\nI've got where the directory\nis read write execute for\n\n1481\n01:22:31.250 --> 01:22:36.590\nthe owner, read and execute for the group,\nand read and execute for everybody else.\n\n1482\n01:22:36.590 --> 01:22:41.410\nSo maybe I wanna add the write\nability to everybody else, right?\n\n1483\n01:22:41.410 --> 01:22:46.640\nSo what I would do is I would say\nchange mod for others, right?\n\n1484\n01:22:46.640 --> 01:22:51.850\nSo u for the user, the owner,\ng for the group, o for others and\n\n1485\n01:22:51.850 --> 01:22:57.790\nI want to add write for ./uploads.\n\n1486\n01:22:57.790 --> 01:23:02.280\nOkay, so I wanna modify the permissions\non uploads for the others value,\n\n1487\n01:23:02.280 --> 01:23:07.750\nand if I take a look at it now,\nI can see where uploads well,\n\n1488\n01:23:07.750 --> 01:23:10.650\neveryone has read, write, and execute now.\n\n1489\n01:23:10.650 --> 01:23:12.890\nNow, read write and\nexecute is a little bit dangerous, and\n\n1490\n01:23:12.890 --> 01:23:15.470\non a directory you don't\nnormally need execute.\n\n1491\n01:23:15.470 --> 01:23:18.000\nBut if I give someone read, write,\nand execute that means they can\n\n1492\n01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.900\nput an executable file on there,\nand then they can run it.\n\n1493\n01:23:20.900 --> 01:23:24.810\nAnd so on something like an uploads\ndirectory, I probably don't want that.\n\n1494\n01:23:24.810 --> 01:23:27.037\nI'm fine with people\nputting things in there but\n\n1495\n01:23:27.037 --> 01:23:30.367\nI don't want them putting a shell\nscript and doing some damage, right?\n\n1496\n01:23:30.367 --> 01:23:34.527\nIf we wanna, well no, I was gonna say I\ncould probably whip up some script or\n\n1497\n01:23:34.527 --> 01:23:36.324\nsomething to run but whatever.\n\n1498\n01:23:36.324 --> 01:23:39.215\nSo that bright green is that\nwarning to us, letting hey,\n\n1499\n01:23:39.215 --> 01:23:43.590\nsomebody could execute some stuff in\nthere and that might be bad, all right?\n\n1500\n01:23:43.590 --> 01:23:50.410\nSo what I may want to do is take away\nthe execute permission for others so\n\n1501\n01:23:50.410 --> 01:23:53.800\nthat they can write stuff in there, but\nthen they can't actually execute it.\n\n1502\n01:23:53.800 --> 01:23:59.155\nAnd so the commands basically the same,\nexcept I say o-x,\n\n1503\n01:23:59.155 --> 01:24:01.315\nremoved the execute permissions.\n\n1504\n01:24:02.485 --> 01:24:06.665\nAnd now when I take a look at\nthat directory I can see that,\n\n1505\n01:24:06.665 --> 01:24:09.305\nwhile we can still read,\nwrite, and execute, read and\n\n1506\n01:24:09.305 --> 01:24:14.040\nexecute here, that people have read and\nwrite but no execute, all right.\n\n1507\n01:24:14.040 --> 01:24:16.907\nSo, they won't be able to execute\nthe things that they put in there.\n\n1508\n01:24:16.907 --> 01:24:20.783\nAnd, if I switch over to my dpezet.\n\n1509\n01:24:20.783 --> 01:24:21.991\nWhere did I put him?\n\n1510\n01:24:21.991 --> 01:24:26.361\nHere, all right, so\nif I switch over to my dpezet, and\n\n1511\n01:24:26.361 --> 01:24:32.540\nI take a look at uploads, I can see that\nroot is the owner and root is the group.\n\n1512\n01:24:32.540 --> 01:24:36.350\nSo I'm not listed, that means the others\npermissions will apply to me.\n\n1513\n01:24:36.350 --> 01:24:39.657\nAnd if I change into\nuploads did I lose read?\n\n1514\n01:24:43.978 --> 01:24:46.820\nI'm forgetting something\nvery important here, sorry.\n\n1515\n01:24:48.260 --> 01:24:51.160\nDirectories, to change into a directory.\n\n1516\n01:24:51.160 --> 01:24:53.180\nYou effectively do have to execute them.\n\n1517\n01:24:53.180 --> 01:24:56.060\nSo I have to execute the directory\nto get inside of it and\n\n1518\n01:24:56.060 --> 01:24:57.140\nI removed that permission.\n\n1519\n01:24:57.140 --> 01:24:58.900\nAnd so\nthat's why I'm not able to get in there.\n\n1520\n01:24:58.900 --> 01:25:01.690\nNow the files that I create inside\nof there are held to a slightly\n\n1521\n01:25:01.690 --> 01:25:02.340\ndifferent standard.\n\n1522\n01:25:02.340 --> 01:25:03.660\nWe'll see that here in just a second.\n\n1523\n01:25:03.660 --> 01:25:07.907\nSo let me flip back to my root user.\n\n1524\n01:25:07.907 --> 01:25:14.366\nAnd let's see, I need to do there.\n\n1525\n01:25:14.366 --> 01:25:17.074\nSo I need to put back\nthat execute permission.\n\n1526\n01:25:17.074 --> 01:25:18.910\nSo I'm just going to stick\nthat right back on there.\n\n1527\n01:25:24.741 --> 01:25:26.900\nAnd now I can change directory in there.\n\n1528\n01:25:26.900 --> 01:25:29.616\nAnd if I try and\ncreate a file, there we go.\n\n1529\n01:25:29.616 --> 01:25:33.622\nAnd if I look at the file permissions\nthat are on it, see how I'm the owner and\n\n1530\n01:25:33.622 --> 01:25:36.190\nnotice how I didn't get\nexecute permissions.\n\n1531\n01:25:36.190 --> 01:25:39.580\nI got read and\nwrite because I'm the owner.\n\n1532\n01:25:39.580 --> 01:25:41.330\nI got read and\nwrite because I'm the group.\n\n1533\n01:25:41.330 --> 01:25:45.657\nAnd I got read so I can read it,\nbut I didn't get execute, okay?\n\n1534\n01:25:45.657 --> 01:25:47.060\nNow why is that?\n\n1535\n01:25:47.060 --> 01:25:49.200\nAnd then this is kind of a weird\npermission set to get read, write,\n\n1536\n01:25:49.200 --> 01:25:50.990\nread, write, read, all right?\n\n1537\n01:25:50.990 --> 01:25:53.250\nWell let's go back to my notes here.\n\n1538\n01:25:53.250 --> 01:25:56.836\nSo read, write, read, write, read,\n\n1539\n01:25:56.836 --> 01:26:01.700\nwell if we look down here,\nread write, here we go.\n\n1540\n01:26:01.700 --> 01:26:05.660\nSo read write write is 6 for\nthe user, read write is 6 for\n\n1541\n01:26:05.660 --> 01:26:10.910\nthe group, and then read is 4,\nI kinda put that down here,\n\n1542\n01:26:10.910 --> 01:26:15.950\nthe default with a umask of 022,\nis that files will end up with that 664.\n\n1543\n01:26:15.950 --> 01:26:20.510\nAnd so that applied and that's exactly\nwhat I wanted in this case anyway.\n\n1544\n01:26:20.510 --> 01:26:21.750\nSo that's what kicked in.\n\n1545\n01:26:21.750 --> 01:26:25.781\nAnd now the users can upload their data,\nbut not be able to execute.\n\n1546\n01:26:25.781 --> 01:26:31.550\nSo that umask of 022, that is that\ndefault one that we typically stick with.\n\n1547\n01:26:31.550 --> 01:26:36.530\nBut it has different levels for files\nversus folders because of that reason\n\n1548\n01:26:36.530 --> 01:26:39.860\nthat we do need to be able to execute\na folder just to get inside of it.\n\n1549\n01:26:39.860 --> 01:26:43.130\nBut once we're inside of it, we don't\nneed to execute the files that we write.\n\n1550\n01:26:43.130 --> 01:26:46.020\nSo, it's a little bit\nstrange how that works out.\n\n1551\n01:26:46.020 --> 01:26:47.130\n>> Good to know.\n\n1552\n01:26:47.130 --> 01:26:50.030\n>> Working with the numbers,\nthis could all be incredibly difficult.\n\n1553\n01:26:50.030 --> 01:26:55.023\n>> Yeah.\n>> Working with the symbolic notation\n\n1554\n01:26:55.023 --> 01:26:58.140\nis a lot easier.\n\n1555\n01:26:58.140 --> 01:27:01.040\nWorking with the umasks just becomes\nreally strange because it is\n\n1556\n01:27:01.040 --> 01:27:02.910\na different set of numbers.\n\n1557\n01:27:02.910 --> 01:27:05.340\nMost of us never mess with umasks though.\n\n1558\n01:27:05.340 --> 01:27:07.660\nThe default values that\nare assigned are fine and\n\n1559\n01:27:07.660 --> 01:27:10.560\nthen we just manipulate files as needed.\n\n1560\n01:27:10.560 --> 01:27:14.286\nEvery now and then you'll come across\nsome software that will tell you,\n\n1561\n01:27:14.286 --> 01:27:16.910\nyou need to install this\nsoftware in this directory and\n\n1562\n01:27:16.910 --> 01:27:20.330\nyou need to change\nthe directory do chmod 777.\n\n1563\n01:27:20.330 --> 01:27:22.475\nAll right, I can't tell you\nhow many times I've seen that.\n\n1564\n01:27:22.475 --> 01:27:26.305\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> If it is a network connected system,\n\n1565\n01:27:26.305 --> 01:27:27.744\n777 is bad.\n\n1566\n01:27:27.744 --> 01:27:29.699\n>> Yeah.\n>> You definitely don't want that.\n\n1567\n01:27:29.699 --> 01:27:31.470\nI know that's supposed\nto be a lucky number.\n\n1568\n01:27:31.470 --> 01:27:34.699\nAll sevens in Vegas and\nstuff but it's bad.\n\n1569\n01:27:34.699 --> 01:27:39.769\nBecause that people can write data, and\nthen turn around and execute it, and\n\n1570\n01:27:39.769 --> 01:27:45.160\nthat's usually how people exploit servers,\nso you typically don't want that.\n\n1571\n01:27:45.160 --> 01:27:50.148\nBut yeah, so if I wanted to make\na directory read, write, execute,\n\n1572\n01:27:50.148 --> 01:27:53.938\nthat would be 777,\neverybody gets full access.\n\n1573\n01:27:53.938 --> 01:27:55.881\nIt's fine to do that to the owner,\n\n1574\n01:27:55.881 --> 01:27:59.038\nthe person who creates it if\nthey're a trusted person.\n\n1575\n01:27:59.038 --> 01:28:01.228\nBut you don't wanna do that for\nthe Others category.\n\n1576\n01:28:01.228 --> 01:28:05.626\nBecause everybody, anybody,\nwhether they authenticate it or not,\n\n1577\n01:28:05.626 --> 01:28:08.150\ncan do that and that can be bad.\n\n1578\n01:28:08.150 --> 01:28:08.700\nAll right.\n\n1579\n01:28:08.700 --> 01:28:13.190\nSo, those are kind of a preview of\nthe permissions there with chmod.\n\n1580\n01:28:13.190 --> 01:28:16.850\nWe're gonna see groups again later, when\nwe get to talking about how to put users\n\n1581\n01:28:16.850 --> 01:28:19.820\nin a group and take them out,\nand stuff like that.\n\n1582\n01:28:19.820 --> 01:28:21.660\nBut, as far as the file permissions,\n\n1583\n01:28:21.660 --> 01:28:24.730\nmost of us never worry about\nthe umask side of things.\n\n1584\n01:28:24.730 --> 01:28:28.510\nBut I wanted to put it in my in notes\nbecause they could show up on the exam.\n\n1585\n01:28:28.510 --> 01:28:30.590\nAnd just remember if you\nwant manipulate that,\n\n1586\n01:28:30.590 --> 01:28:34.610\nit is done in that /etc /profile file.\n\n1587\n01:28:34.610 --> 01:28:37.020\nSo if I pull that up again.\n\n1588\n01:28:37.020 --> 01:28:39.660\nWait, I'm a regular user so\nthat's not gonna be happy about that.\n\n1589\n01:28:42.627 --> 01:28:44.830\nSo I'm just going to pull\nthat file back up again.\n\n1590\n01:28:44.830 --> 01:28:48.610\nAnd it was just down towards the end\nwhere it's adjusting that umask based on\n\n1591\n01:28:48.610 --> 01:28:49.420\nwho it is.\n\n1592\n01:28:49.420 --> 01:28:51.350\nSo, users on your system,\n\n1593\n01:28:51.350 --> 01:28:55.110\nregular users, are actually operating\non under a slightly different umask.\n\n1594\n01:28:55.110 --> 01:28:57.900\nSo, when D Pezet creates something,\n\n1595\n01:28:57.900 --> 01:29:01.790\nit has different defaults than when\nan administrator creates something.\n\n1596\n01:29:01.790 --> 01:29:05.990\nSo, that is important to know, and we can\nmanipulate that however is necessary.\n\n1597\n01:29:07.570 --> 01:29:09.520\nThere's a lot of good\ndocumentation out there.\n\n1598\n01:29:09.520 --> 01:29:11.110\nI know a lot of people don't trust\n\n1599\n01:29:11.110 --> 01:29:12.040\nthe NSA,\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1600\n01:29:12.040 --> 01:29:13.350\n>> But, the NSA\n\n1601\n01:29:13.350 --> 01:29:16.600\non their website they have some white\npapers on how to harden Linux servers, and\n\n1602\n01:29:16.600 --> 01:29:19.930\nthey go into ways to manipulate\nyour umask or for groups and\n\n1603\n01:29:19.930 --> 01:29:23.440\nstuff where it can actually be\nreally powerful to contain users and\n\n1604\n01:29:23.440 --> 01:29:26.270\nmake sure that they don't have\nmore access than they should.\n\n1605\n01:29:26.270 --> 01:29:30.890\nBut really if your using sc Linux which\nwe'll talk about in another episode\n\n1606\n01:29:31.910 --> 01:29:35.000\nIt kind of eliminates the need for this.\n\n1607\n01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:38.510\nAnd we still use these permissions,\nbut SC Linux gives us so\n\n1608\n01:29:38.510 --> 01:29:41.645\nmuch more power that we find\nwe rely on that a lot more.\n\n1609\n01:29:41.645 --> 01:29:43.590\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1610\n01:29:43.590 --> 01:29:44.510\n>> So, all right.\n\n1611\n01:29:44.510 --> 01:29:49.600\nSo those are file permissions,\nand definitely important.\n\n1612\n01:29:49.600 --> 01:29:52.640\nThe last things that we need\nto talk about in this episode\n\n1613\n01:29:52.640 --> 01:29:55.170\nare going to be-\n>> Links\n\n1614\n01:29:55.170 --> 01:29:58.090\n>> Yeah, links, and shared libraries.\n\n1615\n01:29:58.090 --> 01:30:03.570\nSo, we're going to talk about links,\nwhich are files that look like files but\n\n1616\n01:30:03.570 --> 01:30:06.600\naren't actually there, and\nthen we're going to talk about libraries,\n\n1617\n01:30:06.600 --> 01:30:08.420\ncuz that's where we almost\nalways use the links.\n\n1618\n01:30:08.420 --> 01:30:10.530\nSo we'll get a chance to see those too,\nand\n\n1619\n01:30:10.530 --> 01:30:13.070\nthen I promise,\nthat'll be the end of file systems.\n\n1620\n01:30:13.070 --> 01:30:14.290\nI know that we're three episodes in,\n\n1621\n01:30:14.290 --> 01:30:16.550\nyou guys are probably tired\nabout learning about files.\n\n1622\n01:30:16.550 --> 01:30:18.030\nSo it'll be the last bit for it.\n\n1623\n01:30:18.030 --> 01:30:22.196\nSo, let's stop here and\ntake a break, and when we get back,\n\n1624\n01:30:22.196 --> 01:30:26.792\nthe exciting conclusion to our\nthree part series on file systems.\n\n1625\n01:30:26.792 --> 01:30:33.084\n[MUSIC]\n\n1626\n01:30:33.084 --> 01:30:34.980\nAll right, welcome back everybody.\n\n1627\n01:30:34.980 --> 01:30:39.210\nSo for our last segment,\nI want to talk about file links.\n\n1628\n01:30:39.210 --> 01:30:43.050\nAll right, now, file links\nare a commonly misunderstood thing.\n\n1629\n01:30:43.050 --> 01:30:48.020\nBasically what they allow us to do is to\ncreate, effectively, shortcuts to a file.\n\n1630\n01:30:48.020 --> 01:30:50.630\nSometimes file names can be really long.\n\n1631\n01:30:50.630 --> 01:30:52.950\nThe paths to the file can be really long.\n\n1632\n01:30:52.950 --> 01:30:56.350\nAnd so we might wanna create some kind\nof alias or shortcut to get to them.\n\n1633\n01:30:56.350 --> 01:31:00.780\nAnd so we can create that kind of\na shortcut in different places.\n\n1634\n01:31:00.780 --> 01:31:04.400\nSo for example,\nlet's take a look here at my computer.\n\n1635\n01:31:04.400 --> 01:31:12.330\nAnd so I'm logged in as root, and we\ncreated this folder /mnt/Storage, right?\n\n1636\n01:31:12.330 --> 01:31:15.440\nBut maybe every day,\nwhen I come into work or\n\n1637\n01:31:15.440 --> 01:31:19.520\nwhatever, I log in and I violate\nsecurity practices and I log in as root.\n\n1638\n01:31:19.520 --> 01:31:22.930\nSo I log in, and\nI start out of my home directory.\n\n1639\n01:31:22.930 --> 01:31:28.630\nAnd then every day, I've gotta do change\ndirectory slash mount slash storage,\n\n1640\n01:31:28.630 --> 01:31:30.860\nto get over here and access that stuff.\n\n1641\n01:31:30.860 --> 01:31:31.400\nAll right.\n\n1642\n01:31:31.400 --> 01:31:33.270\nAnd I'm just sick and tired of it.\n\n1643\n01:31:33.270 --> 01:31:35.830\nWell, what I can do is,\nI can create a virtual link.\n\n1644\n01:31:35.830 --> 01:31:37.600\nI can link the storage folders so\n\n1645\n01:31:37.600 --> 01:31:41.282\nthat it looks like it's right\nhere inside of my home directory.\n\n1646\n01:31:41.282 --> 01:31:44.520\nAll right, that's what a link does,\nthey're pretty simple.\n\n1647\n01:31:44.520 --> 01:31:50.350\nSo, with a link what we do is we say LN,\nso that's the link command,\n\n1648\n01:31:50.350 --> 01:31:53.650\nand then we specify the target,\nwho it is that we're linking.\n\n1649\n01:31:53.650 --> 01:31:56.960\nSo, I'm linking slash mount,\nslash storage.\n\n1650\n01:31:56.960 --> 01:31:59.740\nAnd then we specify the link\nthat we wanna create.\n\n1651\n01:31:59.740 --> 01:32:03.270\nAnd so, I wanna create a link\nright here in my own directory.\n\n1652\n01:32:03.270 --> 01:32:07.060\nThat says, shoot,\nthat says I wanna link it here.\n\n1653\n01:32:07.060 --> 01:32:13.460\nNow links are typically created for\na file, right?\n\n1654\n01:32:13.460 --> 01:32:16.660\nAnd I'm linking a directory, so\nit complained about that, telling me hard\n\n1655\n01:32:16.660 --> 01:32:22.650\nlinks are not allowed for a directory and\nif we look at the man file for links.\n\n1656\n01:32:22.650 --> 01:32:24.000\nYou'll see some information in there.\n\n1657\n01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:28.430\nAnd notice how you can do a directory,\nit will let you, right.\n\n1658\n01:32:28.430 --> 01:32:33.060\nBut notice the little add in they do\nthere, a -t and if we come down here and\n\n1659\n01:32:33.060 --> 01:32:35.380\nfind the -t in our list.\n\n1660\n01:32:35.380 --> 01:32:38.230\nYou'll see specify the directory\nin which to create the links.\n\n1661\n01:32:38.230 --> 01:32:40.500\nThat's the target directory that\nwe're going to be placing it in.\n\n1662\n01:32:40.500 --> 01:32:43.810\nActually, that's not the one\nthat does the directory, is it?\n\n1663\n01:32:43.810 --> 01:32:49.430\nWe need to do,\nshoot what is the other one?\n\n1664\n01:32:49.430 --> 01:32:52.680\nIt is, is it dash s?\n\n1665\n01:32:52.680 --> 01:32:53.580\nHang on a second.\n\n1666\n01:32:57.350 --> 01:33:00.190\nThere we go, dash s I did a hard link.\n\n1667\n01:33:00.190 --> 01:33:04.270\nI need to do a soft link, and so\nI do a -s, and now it'll create it.\n\n1668\n01:33:04.270 --> 01:33:06.680\nAnd if I look, there I've got that stored.\n\n1669\n01:33:06.680 --> 01:33:09.320\nSo, I'm in my /root.\n\n1670\n01:33:09.320 --> 01:33:12.660\nAnd now if I change into storage,\nthere we go.\n\n1671\n01:33:12.660 --> 01:33:19.030\nAnd I'm in there, I see it, but if I look\nat the path, it shows up as /root/storage.\n\n1672\n01:33:19.030 --> 01:33:21.520\nDoesn't show us /mount/storage.\n\n1673\n01:33:21.520 --> 01:33:23.770\nOkay.\nI had to flip to a soft link there,\n\n1674\n01:33:23.770 --> 01:33:24.960\ncuz I was doing a directory.\n\n1675\n01:33:24.960 --> 01:33:28.070\nAnd it complained and said you can't\ndo a hard link, and I was gonna try and\n\n1676\n01:33:28.070 --> 01:33:31.820\noverride it, I thought -t did it but\nit's just doing a soft link that does it.\n\n1677\n01:33:31.820 --> 01:33:33.630\nSo I switched to a soft link.\n\n1678\n01:33:33.630 --> 01:33:38.760\nThe difference was when I ran\nLN I had to do a -s to say soft.\n\n1679\n01:33:38.760 --> 01:33:40.260\nThe default is a hard link.\n\n1680\n01:33:40.260 --> 01:33:42.390\nAll right, now what's the difference?\n\n1681\n01:33:42.390 --> 01:33:42.890\nAll right.\n\n1682\n01:33:42.890 --> 01:33:45.630\nWhy didn't it let me do\nthat with the directory?\n\n1683\n01:33:45.630 --> 01:33:47.169\nWell the difference is\nhow these things work.\n\n1684\n01:33:48.210 --> 01:33:50.650\nA hard link is the default, and\n\n1685\n01:33:50.650 --> 01:33:55.220\nwhat you do is, well,\nI guess I'm getting ahead of myself.\n\n1686\n01:33:55.220 --> 01:33:57.370\nHow is a file stored in the first place?\n\n1687\n01:33:57.370 --> 01:33:59.900\nWhen a file is stored in your hard drive,\n\n1688\n01:33:59.900 --> 01:34:04.630\nthe first thing it does is it creates\nan entry in the file system table.\n\n1689\n01:34:04.630 --> 01:34:06.590\nWhatever that file system uses.\n\n1690\n01:34:06.590 --> 01:34:11.510\nSo most file systems like EXT and\nNTFS and FAT32 or\n\n1691\n01:34:11.510 --> 01:34:15.280\nwhatever have a table at the very\nbeginning of the file system\n\n1692\n01:34:15.280 --> 01:34:20.310\nthat lists the name of every single\nfile and folder on your hard drive.\n\n1693\n01:34:21.580 --> 01:34:25.590\nAnd then the data is stored\nsomewhere else on the drive, right,\n\n1694\n01:34:25.590 --> 01:34:27.640\nany where on the drive that\ndata gets thrown out there.\n\n1695\n01:34:28.870 --> 01:34:29.970\nAnd that's where it is.\n\n1696\n01:34:29.970 --> 01:34:34.890\nBut the table at the very beginning of the\ndrive, that's where we identify the files.\n\n1697\n01:34:34.890 --> 01:34:39.320\nWell, a file has those two pieces,\nyou have the name and the data.\n\n1698\n01:34:39.320 --> 01:34:42.610\nA folder on the other hand,\na folder doesn't have data,\n\n1699\n01:34:42.610 --> 01:34:43.610\na folder just has a name.\n\n1700\n01:34:43.610 --> 01:34:47.420\nThere's an entry on the file system\ntable that says this folder exists\n\n1701\n01:34:47.420 --> 01:34:48.210\nBut that's it.\n\n1702\n01:34:48.210 --> 01:34:50.020\nThere's no actual data to it.\n\n1703\n01:34:50.020 --> 01:34:52.210\nSo a folder is missing a piece.\n\n1704\n01:34:52.210 --> 01:34:57.150\nWhen we make a hard link what we're\ndoing is we're adding an extra\n\n1705\n01:34:57.150 --> 01:35:01.270\nentry in the file system table\nthat says this points to\n\n1706\n01:35:01.270 --> 01:35:03.370\nthis set of data even though they're the-\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1707\n01:35:03.370 --> 01:35:04.290\n>> It gets confusing.\n\n1708\n01:35:04.290 --> 01:35:05.240\nLet me draw a picture.\n\n1709\n01:35:05.240 --> 01:35:07.260\nA picture is worth a thousand words.\n\n1710\n01:35:07.260 --> 01:35:10.340\nSometimes.\nSo I'm gonna draw a picture.\n\n1711\n01:35:10.340 --> 01:35:13.200\nCuz we do have to\nunderstand how a hard drive\n\n1712\n01:35:13.200 --> 01:35:18.100\nfunctions to really see\nwhat's going on here.\n\n1713\n01:35:18.100 --> 01:35:25.075\nAnd Adobe Is always trying to force\nupdates on me, and so there we go.\n\n1714\n01:35:25.075 --> 01:35:28.565\nAll right, so I'm just gonna\ndo a new blank file here and\n\n1715\n01:35:28.565 --> 01:35:30.555\nI wanna kind of draw a hard drive, right?\n\n1716\n01:35:30.555 --> 01:35:37.865\nSo if we think about a hard drive, a hard\ndrive is platter, something like this,\n\n1717\n01:35:37.865 --> 01:35:42.845\nif were to crack open a hard drive, inside\nof it would be a metallic platter, right?\n\n1718\n01:35:42.845 --> 01:35:46.390\nAnd in the middle of it somewhere,\nThere is going to be\n\n1719\n01:35:46.390 --> 01:35:51.710\na spindle that the whole\ndrive spins around, right?\n\n1720\n01:35:51.710 --> 01:35:58.228\nSo that spindle's in the middle somewhere,\nand the disc spins around it.\n\n1721\n01:35:58.228 --> 01:36:01.258\nWhen we write data to that platter,\n\n1722\n01:36:01.258 --> 01:36:06.008\nwhat happens is the File\nsystem table that I mentioned.\n\n1723\n01:36:06.008 --> 01:36:10.080\nThat file system table is actually\nin the middle of that disk.\n\n1724\n01:36:10.080 --> 01:36:13.600\nIt is as close to the inner ring as it\ncan cuz it's some of the first data\n\n1725\n01:36:13.600 --> 01:36:14.190\nthat's being written.\n\n1726\n01:36:14.190 --> 01:36:18.120\nNow, I'm talking about a physical\nrepresentation, if this is a partition\n\n1727\n01:36:18.120 --> 01:36:21.570\nlike a logical volume,\nthen it could be located somewhere else.\n\n1728\n01:36:21.570 --> 01:36:23.240\nIf you've created a bunch of volumes.\n\n1729\n01:36:23.240 --> 01:36:27.680\nBut just kind of going generic style here.\n\n1730\n01:36:27.680 --> 01:36:31.980\nIt's gonna be right towards the middle and\nmaybe I'll color that green or\n\n1731\n01:36:31.980 --> 01:36:32.958\nmaybe I won't.\n\n1732\n01:36:32.958 --> 01:36:34.470\nMaybe I'll try again and color it green.\n\n1733\n01:36:34.470 --> 01:36:35.040\nThere we go.\n\n1734\n01:36:35.040 --> 01:36:35.860\nAll right.\n\n1735\n01:36:35.860 --> 01:36:39.000\nSo, that would be like\nmy file system table.\n\n1736\n01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:40.400\nSo, when I create a file or\n\n1737\n01:36:40.400 --> 01:36:44.740\nI create the folder, the fact that it\nexists is logged right there in the table.\n\n1738\n01:36:44.740 --> 01:36:45.570\nOkay.\n\n1739\n01:36:45.570 --> 01:36:47.140\nBut then what about the actual data?\n\n1740\n01:36:47.140 --> 01:36:52.020\nIf I right a five meg file,\na little pointer is stuck in here and\n\n1741\n01:36:52.020 --> 01:36:58.140\nthen the file itself will get written,\nthat's not what I wanted.\n\n1742\n01:36:58.140 --> 01:36:59.480\nI go crazy with my tools here.\n\n1743\n01:36:59.480 --> 01:37:03.458\nAll right, that file itself may be written\nway out here on the drive somewhere.\n\n1744\n01:37:03.458 --> 01:37:10.797\nRight, and so it's a here is the actual\nfile being written out here on the drive.\n\n1745\n01:37:10.797 --> 01:37:12.042\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Okay, so,\n\n1746\n01:37:12.042 --> 01:37:16.080\nwhen I go to access the file\na two step process happens.\n\n1747\n01:37:16.080 --> 01:37:19.370\nStep number one, I look right here\n\n1748\n01:37:19.370 --> 01:37:23.980\ninto the Into the table to\nsay where is this file?\n\n1749\n01:37:23.980 --> 01:37:26.810\nWhere's file 1.txt, okay?\n\n1750\n01:37:26.810 --> 01:37:30.098\nAnd then it looks for me and it finds out.\n\n1751\n01:37:30.098 --> 01:37:33.110\nAnd it says, okay,\nyou can get to file 1.txt.\n\n1752\n01:37:33.110 --> 01:37:36.240\nIt's data is logged over here.\n\n1753\n01:37:36.240 --> 01:37:40.960\nIt starts right here and\nit ends right here.\n\n1754\n01:37:40.960 --> 01:37:43.020\nIt tells me the eye nodes.\n\n1755\n01:37:43.020 --> 01:37:46.210\nIt tells me where to go to\nlook on the disk to find it.\n\n1756\n01:37:46.210 --> 01:37:49.880\nAnd it says just go and\nlook in this area right through here,\n\n1757\n01:37:49.880 --> 01:37:51.790\nyou'll find exactly what\nyou're looking for.\n\n1758\n01:37:51.790 --> 01:37:54.930\nAnd, just read it from this point to\nthis point you'll get the whole file.\n\n1759\n01:37:54.930 --> 01:37:58.690\nOr if there's fragmentation it might say,\nwell, some of it's here,\n\n1760\n01:37:58.690 --> 01:38:01.920\nsome of it's over here,\nsome of it's over here and so on, right?\n\n1761\n01:38:01.920 --> 01:38:04.470\nSo, that's what we find\nin the file system table.\n\n1762\n01:38:04.470 --> 01:38:08.063\nAnd I guess if I wanted to represent\nthis a little more accurately,\n\n1763\n01:38:08.063 --> 01:38:12.377\nI could have moved this around a bit,\ncuz you get that reference from the table.\n\n1764\n01:38:12.377 --> 01:38:12.900\nRight?\n\n1765\n01:38:12.900 --> 01:38:14.260\nSo we check the table first and\n\n1766\n01:38:14.260 --> 01:38:19.360\nit kinda points us, if I could\nget my little mouse going better.\n\n1767\n01:38:19.360 --> 01:38:21.709\nThere we go, it kinda points\nus to where we need to look.\n\n1768\n01:38:23.080 --> 01:38:24.750\nAnd sends us in that right direction.\n\n1769\n01:38:24.750 --> 01:38:28.480\nSo it gives us the beginning and\nthe end of that file.\n\n1770\n01:38:28.480 --> 01:38:34.190\nSo, when we do a hard link, what we're\ndoing is we're adding an extra entry in\n\n1771\n01:38:34.190 --> 01:38:41.470\nhere that says there's another file name,\nand it points to this same set of data.\n\n1772\n01:38:41.470 --> 01:38:45.740\nSo I come into read for\na differnt file name, right?\n\n1773\n01:38:45.740 --> 01:38:53.200\nSo, maybe over here, I'm looking for\n/mnt/Storage/fileone.txt,\n\n1774\n01:38:53.200 --> 01:38:59.130\nbut over here, I'm looking for\n/root/fileone.txt, all right?\n\n1775\n01:38:59.130 --> 01:39:04.642\nBut in this other entry,\nIt contains a little note or whatever.\n\n1776\n01:39:04.642 --> 01:39:06.860\nI'm gonna change the color so\nwe don't get these mixed up.\n\n1777\n01:39:06.860 --> 01:39:10.180\nIt contains a little note or whatever\nthat says yeah you can get to that file,\n\n1778\n01:39:10.180 --> 01:39:14.480\nit begins right here and\nit ends right here.\n\n1779\n01:39:14.480 --> 01:39:19.000\nIt's pointing to that same file\nfrom the other example, right?\n\n1780\n01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:21.750\nTwo different pointers, the same data.\n\n1781\n01:39:22.920 --> 01:39:28.430\nSo, a hard link is telling is that\nthat file exists at these inodes and\n\n1782\n01:39:28.430 --> 01:39:30.010\nwe can get right to it.\n\n1783\n01:39:30.010 --> 01:39:32.480\nWell, I wanted to link\na directory a minute ago.\n\n1784\n01:39:32.480 --> 01:39:34.150\nDo directories have data?\n\n1785\n01:39:34.150 --> 01:39:34.930\nNo.\nThey just\n\n1786\n01:39:34.930 --> 01:39:38.450\nhave a pointer here that they exist,\na folder exists, and that's it.\n\n1787\n01:39:38.450 --> 01:39:40.600\nAnd that's why it wouldn't\nlet me do a hard link.\n\n1788\n01:39:40.600 --> 01:39:43.470\nA soft link is a little bit different.\n\n1789\n01:39:43.470 --> 01:39:49.738\nWith a soft link, so\nthis is an example of a hard link.\n\n1790\n01:39:49.738 --> 01:39:52.670\nI'm just gonna add that to the note.\n\n1791\n01:39:52.670 --> 01:39:55.680\nI'll export this image as\npart of the show notes.\n\n1792\n01:39:55.680 --> 01:40:00.433\nBut so this may be /route/file1.txt.\n\n1793\n01:40:09.911 --> 01:40:10.591\nThere we go.\n\n1794\n01:40:14.111 --> 01:40:19.360\nAnd then this one down here might be\n\n1795\n01:40:19.360 --> 01:40:24.616\n/mnt/Storage/file1.txt.\n\n1796\n01:40:24.616 --> 01:40:26.891\nOkay, two different file names,\n\n1797\n01:40:26.891 --> 01:40:30.540\ntwo different pointers both\ngoing to the same data.\n\n1798\n01:40:30.540 --> 01:40:32.838\nThat's what a hard link does.\n\n1799\n01:40:37.138 --> 01:40:38.290\nOkay?\n\n1800\n01:40:38.290 --> 01:40:40.670\nNow, a soft link is different.\n\n1801\n01:40:41.860 --> 01:40:43.660\nIf I take a look at a soft link.\n\n1802\n01:40:44.730 --> 01:40:47.000\nOkay, what do I got to do\nhere to get a new tab?\n\n1803\n01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:50.000\nI got to do your magic, there we go.\n\n1804\n01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:52.410\nAll right, a soft link is different.\n\n1805\n01:40:52.410 --> 01:40:57.380\nWith a soft link,\ninstead of having two pointers\n\n1806\n01:40:57.380 --> 01:41:02.010\nthat both point to the same\ndata It has one pointer so\n\n1807\n01:41:02.010 --> 01:41:09.630\nmaybe this is /root/storage and\nthen this other one is /mount/storage.\n\n1808\n01:41:09.630 --> 01:41:12.830\nSo, I'm talking about folders and\nlet me just add a trailing slash so\n\n1809\n01:41:12.830 --> 01:41:15.970\nwe know that that's a directory\nthat I'm talking about.\n\n1810\n01:41:15.970 --> 01:41:21.290\nOkay, with a soft link,\nthe first one, that's the real file.\n\n1811\n01:41:21.290 --> 01:41:23.780\nAnd sure, it's gonna point to\nwherever that file is, right.\n\n1812\n01:41:23.780 --> 01:41:29.798\nSo, I guess I could stick with doing\na file Just so it's consistent.\n\n1813\n01:41:36.778 --> 01:41:37.310\nAll right.\n\n1814\n01:41:37.310 --> 01:41:37.810\nLike that.\n\n1815\n01:41:38.850 --> 01:41:43.050\nBut the main one, this guy,, sure,\nhe points to where the real data is but,\n\n1816\n01:41:43.050 --> 01:41:46.420\nthe other one,\ninstead of pointing like it's doing here,\n\n1817\n01:41:46.420 --> 01:41:53.040\nlet me just get rid of that- what it\ndoes is something kind of interesting.\n\n1818\n01:41:53.040 --> 01:41:57.795\nIt says, if you wanna get to that file,\nyou don't go to the data,\n\n1819\n01:41:57.795 --> 01:42:00.615\nyou go to the other link.\n\n1820\n01:42:00.615 --> 01:42:06.145\nYou jump around like this to get to it.\n\n1821\n01:42:06.145 --> 01:42:08.261\nAnd boy, that blue is terrible,\nyou can barely see it.\n\n1822\n01:42:08.261 --> 01:42:10.890\nLet me just kinda move\nthat a little bit so\n\n1823\n01:42:10.890 --> 01:42:12.810\nit's a little more clear what's happening.\n\n1824\n01:42:12.810 --> 01:42:13.490\nOkay.\n\n1825\n01:42:13.490 --> 01:42:15.090\nSo here's the process.\n\n1826\n01:42:15.090 --> 01:42:20.778\nIf I look up the actual file, I say I\nneed to find /mnt/Storage/file1.txt.\n\n1827\n01:42:20.778 --> 01:42:22.760\nI go to the file system.\n\n1828\n01:42:22.760 --> 01:42:24.250\nI look in the file system's table.\n\n1829\n01:42:24.250 --> 01:42:27.169\nIt tells me I can find it from this i\nnote all the way through to this i note.\n\n1830\n01:42:28.480 --> 01:42:34.620\nIf I do a lookup against a soft link,\n/root/Storage/file1.txt, I go to the file\n\n1831\n01:42:34.620 --> 01:42:38.960\nsystem and it says, we've got the file,\nyou need to go look at this other pointer.\n\n1832\n01:42:38.960 --> 01:42:42.730\nIt sends me to the other pointer,\nwhich then tells me where to go.\n\n1833\n01:42:42.730 --> 01:42:43.760\nAll right.\n\n1834\n01:42:43.760 --> 01:42:48.330\nThat extra step is what makes\nthis work for a directory, right?\n\n1835\n01:42:48.330 --> 01:42:51.540\nA directory doesn't have data here,\nit refers me over here and\n\n1836\n01:42:51.540 --> 01:42:55.080\nI get the directory, and again it doesn't\nhave data, so it works just fine.\n\n1837\n01:42:55.080 --> 01:42:59.680\nVersus a hard link where the hard link\nactually points to the real data and\n\n1838\n01:42:59.680 --> 01:43:01.310\nthat's why it doesn't work for\na directory.\n\n1839\n01:43:01.310 --> 01:43:03.795\nThat's why that command failed for\nme when I ran it.\n\n1840\n01:43:03.795 --> 01:43:08.000\nAnd just for consistence sake\nI should make this blue too so\n\n1841\n01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:10.040\nthe image makes a little more sense.\n\n1842\n01:43:10.040 --> 01:43:13.740\nBut that's the difference between\na hard link and a soft link.\n\n1843\n01:43:13.740 --> 01:43:16.410\nA hard link is pointing\nto the actual data.\n\n1844\n01:43:16.410 --> 01:43:19.220\nTwo different pointers that\nboth point on the same data.\n\n1845\n01:43:19.220 --> 01:43:21.690\nA soft link is one pointer\n\n1846\n01:43:21.690 --> 01:43:26.230\nthat points to another point Pointer that\nthen goes to the actual data, all right?\n\n1847\n01:43:26.230 --> 01:43:28.510\nSo, which one should we use?\n\n1848\n01:43:28.510 --> 01:43:31.700\nIf the soft link is more flexible maybe\nwe should just use that one, right?\n\n1849\n01:43:31.700 --> 01:43:33.430\nWell, soft links are more flexible.\n\n1850\n01:43:33.430 --> 01:43:37.350\nWe can use them to refer to pretty much\nanything we want, but the negative is\n\n1851\n01:43:37.350 --> 01:43:42.020\nthey have to do two file system look ups,\nso they're less efficient.\n\n1852\n01:43:42.020 --> 01:43:46.570\nOn a heavy disk IO system,\nthis can create performance degradation.\n\n1853\n01:43:46.570 --> 01:43:49.790\nSo soft links are not as good for\nperformance.\n\n1854\n01:43:49.790 --> 01:43:53.743\nSo, whenever possible, in other words,\nwhenever you're doing file links,\n\n1855\n01:43:53.743 --> 01:43:55.998\nwhenever possible you\nshould do a hard link.\n\n1856\n01:43:55.998 --> 01:44:00.598\nHard links you do one file system lookup,\nand then you go right to the data.\n\n1857\n01:44:00.598 --> 01:44:04.208\nAs far as disk I/O is concerned,\nthey are more efficient.\n\n1858\n01:44:04.208 --> 01:44:07.518\nOkay, so hard links whenever you can.\n\n1859\n01:44:07.518 --> 01:44:10.950\nYou'll only use soft links\nif they're your only option.\n\n1860\n01:44:10.950 --> 01:44:12.910\nAnd that's why hard links are the default.\n\n1861\n01:44:12.910 --> 01:44:14.840\nAnd so when we go to link something,\n\n1862\n01:44:14.840 --> 01:44:18.725\njust using ln by itself\nautomatically creates a hard link.\n\n1863\n01:44:18.725 --> 01:44:21.070\nln-s does the soft link,\nand that takes care of it.\n\n1864\n01:44:21.070 --> 01:44:25.420\nSo, if we understand what's going on\nin the background, it makes more sense,\n\n1865\n01:44:25.420 --> 01:44:26.780\nit's kinda easier to see what's going on.\n\n1866\n01:44:26.780 --> 01:44:28.450\nSo that's why I wanted to\ndraw this picture, and\n\n1867\n01:44:28.450 --> 01:44:31.620\nI'll make sure this gets\nposted with the show notes.\n\n1868\n01:44:31.620 --> 01:44:35.655\nBut back here, when I went to apply it,\nI was linking a directory.\n\n1869\n01:44:35.655 --> 01:44:40.295\nA directory doesn't have data so\nit made me do it this way, okay.\n\n1870\n01:44:40.295 --> 01:44:43.765\nNow if I was doing a file instead, so\n\n1871\n01:44:43.765 --> 01:44:47.975\nif I look into /mnt /Storage.\n\n1872\n01:44:47.975 --> 01:44:51.190\nIn there is nothing I\nreally wanna mess with.\n\n1873\n01:44:51.190 --> 01:44:53.010\nLet me just create a file.\n\n1874\n01:44:53.010 --> 01:45:00.850\nSo I'm gonna create a file in there\nwhich I will call file1.txt, okay.\n\n1875\n01:45:00.850 --> 01:45:06.580\nI could have done ln\n/mnt/Storage/file1.txt.\n\n1876\n01:45:06.580 --> 01:45:11.940\nAnd I could have linked it right into\nmy home directory as file1.txt, okay?\n\n1877\n01:45:11.940 --> 01:45:15.440\nAnd, shoot, I broke another rule.\n\n1878\n01:45:15.440 --> 01:45:17.950\nLet me go back to my diagram.\n\n1879\n01:45:19.290 --> 01:45:22.726\nNotice how this data is stored\nin the file system table, okay?\n\n1880\n01:45:22.726 --> 01:45:26.413\nWell, /mnt/Storage for\n\n1881\n01:45:26.413 --> 01:45:30.680\nme is one hard drive,\none volume that has a file system table.\n\n1882\n01:45:30.680 --> 01:45:36.440\nAnd then my home directory is in my\n/ which is a different hard drive,\n\n1883\n01:45:36.440 --> 01:45:38.860\nwhich is a different file system cable.\n\n1884\n01:45:38.860 --> 01:45:43.860\nYou can't create hard links between\ntwo different file systems, okay?\n\n1885\n01:45:43.860 --> 01:45:47.080\nYou can do soft links,\nlike it'll let me do a soft link, but\n\n1886\n01:45:47.080 --> 01:45:50.830\nthat defeats the example\nI was trying to give.\n\n1887\n01:45:50.830 --> 01:45:52.670\nIt's telling me I already have that file.\n\n1888\n01:45:52.670 --> 01:45:58.450\nSo, I'll get rid of that file whoops,\nAnd then do it.\n\n1889\n01:46:00.385 --> 01:46:01.570\nThought I just deleted it.\n\n1890\n01:46:01.570 --> 01:46:03.087\nSo, I'm not seeing a file.\n\n1891\n01:46:07.546 --> 01:46:11.651\nHm, /root/file1.txt, file exists.\n\n1892\n01:46:11.651 --> 01:46:15.230\n>> [LAUGH] Goodness,\nall right well anyhow.\n\n1893\n01:46:15.230 --> 01:46:18.890\nSo, you can do soft links\nbetween volumes like that.\n\n1894\n01:46:18.890 --> 01:46:21.980\nAnd if I do mount, you'll see what I mean.\n\n1895\n01:46:21.980 --> 01:46:26.850\nLooking in here,\nI can find the /mnt/Storage right there,\n\n1896\n01:46:26.850 --> 01:46:29.620\nthat's on /dev/sdb1.\n\n1897\n01:46:29.620 --> 01:46:31.758\nBut if I find just the root, right?\n\n1898\n01:46:31.758 --> 01:46:36.370\n/ where I'm, that's the one that's\nmounted in /sda, well, actually,\n\n1899\n01:46:36.370 --> 01:46:38.690\nit's not /sda, it's in here,\nour dev/mapper.\n\n1900\n01:46:38.690 --> 01:46:42.410\nIt's in the VolGroup, so\nit's on a different hard drive.\n\n1901\n01:46:42.410 --> 01:46:48.060\nSo, let me just make a quick example here\nthat isn't breaking a bunch of crazy\n\n1902\n01:46:48.060 --> 01:46:49.340\nrules.\n\n1903\n01:46:49.340 --> 01:46:52.210\nSo maybe,\nhere I'll just make some new directory.\n\n1904\n01:46:52.210 --> 01:46:56.890\nSo I create a Storage, yeah,\nwe'll do Storage, why not?\n\n1905\n01:46:56.890 --> 01:46:59.129\nA Storage directory,\nwhich apparently already exists.\n\n1906\n01:47:00.588 --> 01:47:04.538\nAll right, and I will make a file2.txt,\n\n1907\n01:47:04.538 --> 01:47:08.750\nactually let me just do like document.txt.\n\n1908\n01:47:08.750 --> 01:47:13.620\nAll right, so in /mnt/Storage,\ndid I not change out,\n\n1909\n01:47:13.620 --> 01:47:16.190\nthat's why it was saying\nit already existed.\n\n1910\n01:47:18.123 --> 01:47:19.212\nThere.\n\n1911\n01:47:22.754 --> 01:47:26.449\nThere, all right,\nnow I've got a document.txt file and\n\n1912\n01:47:26.449 --> 01:47:28.945\nit's right here in /Storage, okay?\n\n1913\n01:47:28.945 --> 01:47:31.370\nAnd if I know I'm gonna be\nworking with this a lot,\n\n1914\n01:47:31.370 --> 01:47:33.660\nI can go back into my home directory and\n\n1915\n01:47:33.660 --> 01:47:43.920\nI can link /Storage/document.text\nto my home directory /document.txt.\n\n1916\n01:47:43.920 --> 01:47:48.060\nThere we go all right and since I didn't\ndo a -s that's gonna be a hard link.\n\n1917\n01:47:49.170 --> 01:47:54.810\nAnd if I take a look at the list and\nI look at the documents in my directory,\n\n1918\n01:47:56.650 --> 01:48:00.340\ntype that into less, there we go.\n\n1919\n01:48:00.340 --> 01:48:05.895\nI can see in my list here, document.txt,\nand it just looks like a normal file.\n\n1920\n01:48:05.895 --> 01:48:07.975\nLooking at this I don't really\nknow that it's any different.\n\n1921\n01:48:09.055 --> 01:48:10.605\nOkay well, it is different.\n\n1922\n01:48:10.605 --> 01:48:16.225\nIf I do a ls doc*, it's not colorizing it,\n\n1923\n01:48:16.225 --> 01:48:20.000\nbut it would actually show as a different\ncolor if it was on my screen.\n\n1924\n01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:21.160\nIf I just do an ls.\n\n1925\n01:48:22.160 --> 01:48:24.140\nActually, it's not showing a hard link.\n\n1926\n01:48:24.140 --> 01:48:28.680\nApparently, the default is not\nto colorize it but it is linked.\n\n1927\n01:48:28.680 --> 01:48:31.520\nAnd I know it's linked because I\ncan make changes to it and see it.\n\n1928\n01:48:31.520 --> 01:48:34.640\nIf I edit that, so\nI'm in my home directory.\n\n1929\n01:48:34.640 --> 01:48:37.300\nAnd so if I edit the copy\nthat's in my home directory,\n\n1930\n01:48:37.300 --> 01:48:42.620\nif I edit document.txt, and\nI start to put in some data.\n\n1931\n01:48:42.620 --> 01:48:44.422\nSo this is some data.\n\n1932\n01:48:46.224 --> 01:48:49.580\nAll right, and I'll just save that.\n\n1933\n01:48:49.580 --> 01:48:55.180\nAnd so\nnow if I do more /root/document.txt.\n\n1934\n01:48:55.180 --> 01:49:00.796\nThere it is, this is some data.\n\n1935\n01:49:00.796 --> 01:49:07.680\nAnd if I run more/Storage/document.txt\nthis is some data, right?\n\n1936\n01:49:07.680 --> 01:49:11.770\nTwo pointers, one pointer for\n/root/document.txt.\n\n1937\n01:49:11.770 --> 01:49:14.600\nAnother pointer for /Storage/document.txt.\n\n1938\n01:49:14.600 --> 01:49:17.880\nBut they point to the same\ndata location on the drive.\n\n1939\n01:49:17.880 --> 01:49:23.460\nThey both point to this,\nwhoops, this same area here.\n\n1940\n01:49:23.460 --> 01:49:27.770\nSo regardless of which one I edit,\nif I edit the one in the storage folder or\n\n1941\n01:49:27.770 --> 01:49:29.870\nif I edit the one that's\nin my own home folder,\n\n1942\n01:49:29.870 --> 01:49:34.470\nit's both modifying the same data and\noff we go, right?\n\n1943\n01:49:34.470 --> 01:49:38.080\nThat's the best way to do\nthem is with a hard link.\n\n1944\n01:49:38.080 --> 01:49:40.510\nWith a soft link, if I go to edit\n\n1945\n01:49:41.890 --> 01:49:47.380\nthe one that I link into my own directory,\nthen what it's gonna do,\n\n1946\n01:49:47.380 --> 01:49:50.880\nis it's gonna forward me over to the other\none doing that extra table lookup.\n\n1947\n01:49:50.880 --> 01:49:54.350\nAnd then I'll get to the data\nto make that modification.\n\n1948\n01:49:54.350 --> 01:49:57.570\nSo I need to be careful with that,\nand avoid them whenever possible.\n\n1949\n01:49:57.570 --> 01:50:01.460\nSo any time I can do a hard link,\nthat's the one you wanna do.\n\n1950\n01:50:01.460 --> 01:50:02.930\nOnly use a soft link if it's required.\n\n1951\n01:50:02.930 --> 01:50:06.800\nIf you're linking to a directory or\nif you're linking like between partitions,\n\n1952\n01:50:06.800 --> 01:50:09.090\nthose are cases where you\nhave to do a soft link.\n\n1953\n01:50:09.090 --> 01:50:09.860\nAnd so you use them.\n\n1954\n01:50:09.860 --> 01:50:15.362\nDon't give up on the tool just cuz it's\nnot the best performance, all right.\n\n1955\n01:50:15.362 --> 01:50:18.230\nSo ln, ln is the secret command there.\n\n1956\n01:50:18.230 --> 01:50:21.780\nAnd if we pull it up,\nthe syntax is really not that challenging.\n\n1957\n01:50:21.780 --> 01:50:25.400\nYou're normally linking to something in\nthe same directory as you're in right now,\n\n1958\n01:50:25.400 --> 01:50:29.400\nyour working directory but you can\nspecify full paths and get that set so\n\n1959\n01:50:29.400 --> 01:50:31.390\na couple of ways to go about that.\n\n1960\n01:50:31.390 --> 01:50:32.500\n>> Nice.\n\n1961\n01:50:32.500 --> 01:50:34.760\n>> Now, the reason we bring up links.\n\n1962\n01:50:34.760 --> 01:50:39.210\nI'll be honest with you, I don't\ntypically have to create links myself but\n\n1963\n01:50:39.210 --> 01:50:42.730\nthey are used extensively\nthroughout your operating system.\n\n1964\n01:50:42.730 --> 01:50:46.690\nAnd the reason is there's some really\nbig advantages to linking files.\n\n1965\n01:50:46.690 --> 01:50:48.560\nHere's it in a scenario.\n\n1966\n01:50:48.560 --> 01:50:50.000\nLet's say you're running Java.\n\n1967\n01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:52.880\nJava, the buggiest,\nmost unsecure software in the planet.\n\n1968\n01:50:52.880 --> 01:50:55.030\nBut for some reason,\nyou have to have Java on your server.\n\n1969\n01:50:56.360 --> 01:51:00.610\nWell, so you download the Java\nlibraries to run on your system.\n\n1970\n01:51:00.610 --> 01:51:05.257\nAnd you've got Java version 1.6.41, right.\n\n1971\n01:51:05.257 --> 01:51:09.120\nAnd then you've got that library\nfile saved to your system.\n\n1972\n01:51:09.120 --> 01:51:12.379\nAnd any program that runs Java can\ncall that file, it's right there.\n\n1973\n01:51:12.379 --> 01:51:18.280\n1.6.41 well,\nnext week an update comes out, 1.6.42.\n\n1974\n01:51:18.280 --> 01:51:20.030\nSo you do the update.\n\n1975\n01:51:20.030 --> 01:51:25.181\nHow does all your software know\nto use Java version 1.6.42?\n\n1976\n01:51:25.181 --> 01:51:26.930\nWell, it doesn't.\n\n1977\n01:51:26.930 --> 01:51:30.260\nYou'd have to tell all your software,\nby the way, now it's .42, and\n\n1978\n01:51:30.260 --> 01:51:33.890\nthen, when does 6.43 came out and\nso on, right?\n\n1979\n01:51:33.890 --> 01:51:35.410\nSo, it becomes a hassle.\n\n1980\n01:51:35.410 --> 01:51:38.200\nSo, what we can do instead,\nwhen we have libraries like that,\n\n1981\n01:51:38.200 --> 01:51:41.280\nwe can create a generic name for\nit like just Java.\n\n1982\n01:51:41.280 --> 01:51:45.740\nAnd we can link that to the actual\nlibrary file which might have a full\n\n1983\n01:51:45.740 --> 01:51:46.920\nversion number in.\n\n1984\n01:51:46.920 --> 01:51:50.128\nAnd every time we do an update,\nwe just change the link.\n\n1985\n01:51:50.128 --> 01:51:54.456\nSo, there's a nice, generic,\neasy-to-use name that never changes,\n\n1986\n01:51:54.456 --> 01:51:58.458\nthat's linked to the file that is\nchanging every time we do updates.\n\n1987\n01:51:58.458 --> 01:52:01.918\nIt is a key component of\nkeeping your system operating.\n\n1988\n01:52:01.918 --> 01:52:05.264\nAnd so,\nin Libraries in those reference files,\n\n1989\n01:52:05.264 --> 01:52:09.330\nyou see links you use very,\nvery frequently, okay?\n\n1990\n01:52:09.330 --> 01:52:12.530\nIn fact, there's a set of commands\nthat we can use to do it.\n\n1991\n01:52:12.530 --> 01:52:16.477\nFirst off, libraries are pretty easy\nto spot, they almost always end in .so.\n\n1992\n01:52:16.477 --> 01:52:22.670\nSo .so, they call them so name files\nshared object is what it stands for.\n\n1993\n01:52:22.670 --> 01:52:26.070\nBut those .SOs,\nthose are our library files, and\n\n1994\n01:52:26.070 --> 01:52:28.140\nyou'll have a lot of them on your system.\n\n1995\n01:52:28.140 --> 01:52:30.810\nMost of them are in /lib.\n\n1996\n01:52:30.810 --> 01:52:33.320\nSo if you go into cd/lib.\n\n1997\n01:52:33.320 --> 01:52:37.472\nAnd take a look at what's in there, you'll\nsee several of them that are in there,\n\n1998\n01:52:37.472 --> 01:52:38.083\nall right.\n\n1999\n01:52:38.083 --> 01:52:40.500\nSo I've got,\nwell these are mostly directories.\n\n2000\n01:52:40.500 --> 01:52:45.159\nBut, actually, let's go into the user one,\n\n2001\n01:52:45.159 --> 01:52:49.265\nthat's a little more fun /user /lib.\n\n2002\n01:52:49.265 --> 01:52:50.240\nBecause here we can see Java.\n\n2003\n01:52:50.240 --> 01:52:52.375\nAll right, notice the Java ones.\n\n2004\n01:52:52.375 --> 01:52:56.990\nIt's gonna be hard to read cuz of the dark\nblue but you'll see one that's just called\n\n2005\n01:52:56.990 --> 01:53:01.810\nJava by itself and then there's Java 131,\n140, 141, 142 and so on.\n\n2006\n01:53:01.810 --> 01:53:05.920\nThese are all the different versions\nof Java, and so each one of these.\n\n2007\n01:53:05.920 --> 01:53:08.330\nWell, these are just\ndifferent directories, right?\n\n2008\n01:53:08.330 --> 01:53:13.320\nAnd if I change into just plain old Java,\nand I take a look at it.\n\n2009\n01:53:13.320 --> 01:53:15.810\nDo I not actually have Java installed?\n\n2010\n01:53:15.810 --> 01:53:16.990\nI might not actually have it installed.\n\n2011\n01:53:16.990 --> 01:53:18.585\nIt might have just created\nthe structure for me.\n\n2012\n01:53:22.459 --> 01:53:24.670\nLet's see.\n\n2013\n01:53:24.670 --> 01:53:26.120\nI don't actually have it installed.\n\n2014\n01:53:26.120 --> 01:53:28.150\nBut you can kinda see\nwhat it's doing though.\n\n2015\n01:53:28.150 --> 01:53:32.310\nAll these different version\nnumbers right here?\n\n2016\n01:53:32.310 --> 01:53:33.600\nYour software,\nyou don't wanna have to go and\n\n2017\n01:53:33.600 --> 01:53:35.960\nupdate your software every\ntime you update Java.\n\n2018\n01:53:35.960 --> 01:53:40.760\nSo your software can just\nreference the generic Java folder.\n\n2019\n01:53:40.760 --> 01:53:45.440\nAnd then as we install different versions\nof Java it can link to those and\n\n2020\n01:53:45.440 --> 01:53:49.470\nlink this Java to the appropriate folder\nfor the version we installed, and\n\n2021\n01:53:49.470 --> 01:53:53.010\ninside of there, linking the libraries\nto wherever they need to be linked.\n\n2022\n01:53:53.010 --> 01:53:55.730\nSo, you know, great way to do that.\n\n2023\n01:53:57.815 --> 01:54:02.030\nSo, OSML, it's an actual file.\n\n2024\n01:54:02.030 --> 01:54:05.630\nWhat is something I do have installed,\nvmware-tools.\n\n2025\n01:54:05.630 --> 01:54:10.270\nThere we go, cuz I'm running vmware and so\nthis is sitting on top of vmware fusion\n\n2026\n01:54:10.270 --> 01:54:16.030\nand so when I look inside of it I\ncan see its lib file right here and\n\n2027\n01:54:16.030 --> 01:54:18.730\nhere I can see a bunch of so files.\n\n2028\n01:54:18.730 --> 01:54:23.580\nRight?\nSo I see libtpvmp.so, right?\n\n2029\n01:54:23.580 --> 01:54:26.210\nThat's that library file.\n\n2030\n01:54:26.210 --> 01:54:27.680\nNow it's just .so.\n\n2031\n01:54:27.680 --> 01:54:30.960\nThere's no version number tied to that,\nbut I can almost guarantee you that it's\n\n2032\n01:54:30.960 --> 01:54:34.910\nlinked to another location where\nit does have a version number.\n\n2033\n01:54:34.910 --> 01:54:40.690\nSo these are called shared libraries and\nhow do we know where these links are?\n\n2034\n01:54:40.690 --> 01:54:44.560\nWell there's often times tons of them and\nit's hard to keep track of so\n\n2035\n01:54:44.560 --> 01:54:47.190\nfortunately we have some configuration\nfiles that help with that.\n\n2036\n01:54:47.190 --> 01:54:49.940\nSo let's take a look at some of those.\n\n2037\n01:54:49.940 --> 01:54:56.167\nAll right, so just as an example,\nlet me see if I can find one.\n\n2038\n01:54:58.200 --> 01:55:03.171\nDo we have, no, well, so\nwhat you'll normally have is you'll\n\n2039\n01:55:03.171 --> 01:55:07.700\nnormally have a library that's\nin one of the lib folders.\n\n2040\n01:55:07.700 --> 01:55:09.264\nSo /lib, /user, /lib,\n\n2041\n01:55:09.264 --> 01:55:13.100\none of those locations where\nyou got your library stored.\n\n2042\n01:55:13.100 --> 01:55:16.300\nAnd when the library is installed,\nwhen the package installs it,\n\n2043\n01:55:16.300 --> 01:55:20.160\nit will create an entry in one of\nthe library configuration files.\n\n2044\n01:55:20.160 --> 01:55:25.390\nAnd you can find them inside of /etc where\nmost of our configurations files are.\n\n2045\n01:55:25.390 --> 01:55:27.770\nInside of our configuration there,\n\n2046\n01:55:27.770 --> 01:55:30.560\nyou'll actually have what's\ncalled a library database.\n\n2047\n01:55:30.560 --> 01:55:34.310\nAnd if we look around,\nyou kinda poke around in this directory.\n\n2048\n01:55:35.820 --> 01:55:37.150\nWe can find it in here.\n\n2049\n01:55:37.150 --> 01:55:42.758\nIt's ld., where is,\nHIJK double alphabet thing, there we go.\n\n2050\n01:55:42.758 --> 01:55:44.790\nld.so.conf.\n\n2051\n01:55:44.790 --> 01:55:51.310\nRight, so library database of shared\nobjects configuration file, so ld.so.conf.\n\n2052\n01:55:51.310 --> 01:55:55.610\nNow it used to be that all of your\nlibraries would get logged into that file\n\n2053\n01:55:55.610 --> 01:56:00.300\nand so if you took a look at\nwhat was in there, so I'll just\n\n2054\n01:56:00.300 --> 01:56:03.840\nsend it through the less command,\nwhat you would see was a ton of libraries.\n\n2055\n01:56:03.840 --> 01:56:05.600\nNow you see includes.\n\n2056\n01:56:05.600 --> 01:56:09.988\nAnd it's saying look in this subdirectory,\nlook in ld.so.conf.d.\n\n2057\n01:56:09.988 --> 01:56:13.360\nFor directory, /*.conf.\n\n2058\n01:56:13.360 --> 01:56:17.130\nAnd so now we can have individual\nconfiguration files that list\n\n2059\n01:56:17.130 --> 01:56:20.860\nthe libraries that are linked.\n\n2060\n01:56:20.860 --> 01:56:24.330\nAnd so I look in there, I can see,\nthere's my VMWare Tools 1.\n\n2061\n01:56:24.330 --> 01:56:25.600\nCuz I installed that.\n\n2062\n01:56:25.600 --> 01:56:27.150\nMySQL, cuz I installed it.\n\n2063\n01:56:27.150 --> 01:56:30.050\nAs you install software,\nthe software will create various ones.\n\n2064\n01:56:30.050 --> 01:56:33.250\nYour kernel also has them,\njust for your base OS.\n\n2065\n01:56:33.250 --> 01:56:34.100\nI'm gonna look at VMWare.\n\n2066\n01:56:36.340 --> 01:56:40.250\nAll right, and so here I can get\na list of the libraries that it uses.\n\n2067\n01:56:40.250 --> 01:56:45.570\nSo it is registering these libraries and\nnone of them have version numbers in them,\n\n2068\n01:56:45.570 --> 01:56:48.210\nokay, they don't have version numbers\nbecause we don't want that, right,\n\n2069\n01:56:48.210 --> 01:56:49.910\nwe don't want it to link to that.\n\n2070\n01:56:49.910 --> 01:56:54.670\nBut each of these will actually be\nlinks to somewhere else where there\n\n2071\n01:56:54.670 --> 01:56:57.990\nwill be version numbers can track that or\nwe can replace them.\n\n2072\n01:56:57.990 --> 01:56:59.760\nOr at least they should be, right.\n\n2073\n01:56:59.760 --> 01:57:01.760\nThe vendors of this software\ncould choose not to do that.\n\n2074\n01:57:01.760 --> 01:57:02.750\nThey could say, screw it.\n\n2075\n01:57:02.750 --> 01:57:05.300\nI'm just gonna name my files this way and\nnot have a version number in them.\n\n2076\n01:57:05.300 --> 01:57:06.810\nThey could do that.\n\n2077\n01:57:06.810 --> 01:57:11.000\nBut the best practice is to have\na separate file and to link to it.\n\n2078\n01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:13.680\nThat way, you're running software that\njust has to have the file name and\n\n2079\n01:57:13.680 --> 01:57:15.250\nnot worry about version numbers.\n\n2080\n01:57:15.250 --> 01:57:18.490\nAnd you can change a link to point\nto different versions as needed.\n\n2081\n01:57:18.490 --> 01:57:21.480\nAll right.\n\n2082\n01:57:21.480 --> 01:57:24.750\nIf we wanna take a look\nat some of the stuff,\n\n2083\n01:57:24.750 --> 01:57:28.050\nwe have the ldd command\nwhich is a pretty handy one.\n\n2084\n01:57:28.050 --> 01:57:32.220\nLdd, you'll see it prints\nshared library dependencies.\n\n2085\n01:57:32.220 --> 01:57:36.880\nWe can take a look at a program and we can\nsay what libraries does it depend upon?\n\n2086\n01:57:36.880 --> 01:57:40.450\nRight?\nSo my shell is the bash shell,\n\n2087\n01:57:40.450 --> 01:57:43.840\nI could say ldd /bin/bash,\n\n2088\n01:57:43.840 --> 01:57:48.650\nand when I run that, it's gonna tell me\nall the libraries that bash depends on.\n\n2089\n01:57:48.650 --> 01:57:55.410\nAnd so I can see It depends on linux-vdso,\nand libtinfo, libdl, and libc, and so on.\n\n2090\n01:57:55.410 --> 01:57:57.430\nYou almost always see libc.\n\n2091\n01:57:57.430 --> 01:58:00.150\nThat's the c library, and\nmost software is written in it.\n\n2092\n01:58:00.150 --> 01:58:04.820\nSo you'll see each of the ones,\nand notice how on the left side,\n\n2093\n01:58:04.820 --> 01:58:07.920\nwe have a file name that's slightly\ndifferent than on the right side.\n\n2094\n01:58:07.920 --> 01:58:09.320\nAt least for some of them we should.\n\n2095\n01:58:09.320 --> 01:58:12.080\nActually, no all these are the same.\n\n2096\n01:58:12.080 --> 01:58:13.730\nI'm not finding creative ones today.\n\n2097\n01:58:13.730 --> 01:58:15.460\nWell you will see where\nhere it's like a name and\n\n2098\n01:58:15.460 --> 01:58:17.320\non the right it's got the full path.\n\n2099\n01:58:17.320 --> 01:58:20.770\nSome of them it's just\npointing directly to it.\n\n2100\n01:58:20.770 --> 01:58:23.140\nSo these are libraries that\nthe system depends on.\n\n2101\n01:58:23.140 --> 01:58:27.020\nIf you don't have those libraries\nsystems not going to work very well.\n\n2102\n01:58:27.020 --> 01:58:29.790\nSo those are some of the things\nwe need to be aware of.\n\n2103\n01:58:29.790 --> 01:58:34.870\nAnother thing to keep in mind is\nwhere these things get stored.\n\n2104\n01:58:34.870 --> 01:58:37.330\nWe basically refer to it,\nlet me just bring up my notes.\n\n2105\n01:58:37.330 --> 01:58:38.376\nI'll show you an example.\n\n2106\n01:58:41.126 --> 01:58:42.910\nLike here.\n\n2107\n01:58:42.910 --> 01:58:47.650\nYou may see several different names for\na library so for example you have\n\n2108\n01:58:47.650 --> 01:58:51.840\nthe fully qualified name that's where we\nactually point to where that file resides.\n\n2109\n01:58:51.840 --> 01:58:55.440\nAnd then you have the library\ndatabase file name.\n\n2110\n01:58:55.440 --> 01:58:58.830\nAnd that might be a little bit longer\nbecause in the library database it'll\n\n2111\n01:58:58.830 --> 01:59:01.420\nactually look in the library and\nextract version numbers.\n\n2112\n01:59:01.420 --> 01:59:05.340\nSo the file might end in three but\ninside the file it might say 3.0 so\n\n2113\n01:59:05.340 --> 01:59:07.720\nthere might be a variation there.\n\n2114\n01:59:07.720 --> 01:59:11.210\nAnd then wherever it's linked\nwill very well likely just drop\n\n2115\n01:59:11.210 --> 01:59:12.980\nthe version number entirely.\n\n2116\n01:59:12.980 --> 01:59:16.220\nSo you may see a library\nreference more than one way.\n\n2117\n01:59:16.220 --> 01:59:18.500\nHopefully you're seeing it\nreferenced this way right here,\n\n2118\n01:59:18.500 --> 01:59:20.870\nwithout any version numbers or\nanything like that.\n\n2119\n01:59:20.870 --> 01:59:23.330\nBecause that's going to\nbe a nice good link, so\n\n2120\n01:59:23.330 --> 01:59:25.730\nwhen we do updates we don't\nhave to worry about it, right?\n\n2121\n01:59:25.730 --> 01:59:29.000\nBut again not every vendor\nhas to follow that.\n\n2122\n01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:30.260\nSo we can take a peek at ours,\n\n2123\n01:59:30.260 --> 01:59:35.170\nI showed you the ld.so.confile,\nwe can also use ldconfig to see it.\n\n2124\n01:59:35.170 --> 01:59:36.690\nIf we run ldconfig/v,\n\n2125\n01:59:36.690 --> 01:59:42.670\nthe nice thing about ldconfig/v is that\nit looks through all the config files.\n\n2126\n01:59:42.670 --> 01:59:44.510\nYou don't have to go through each one.\n\n2127\n01:59:44.510 --> 01:59:47.200\nAnd in here, we can start to see some\nof those links, look at some of these.\n\n2128\n01:59:47.200 --> 01:59:54.370\nLike, libcurl.so.4 is actually\nlinked to libcurl.so.4.1.1, right?\n\n2129\n01:59:54.370 --> 01:59:59.250\nSo if 4.1.2 comes out,\nall it has to do is change this link and\n\n2130\n01:59:59.250 --> 02:00:03.270\nnow everybody can access libcurl.so.4 and\nthey're actually getting 4.1.2.\n\n2131\n02:00:03.270 --> 02:00:06.208\nSo that's the power of links.\n\n2132\n02:00:06.208 --> 02:00:10.066\nYou may not use them, but\nyour packages and your system updates?\n\n2133\n02:00:10.066 --> 02:00:13.546\nThey're using them all the time\nto keep stuff like this straight.\n\n2134\n02:00:13.546 --> 02:00:17.380\nThat's the power of links and\nhow it ties into shared libraries.\n\n2135\n02:00:18.980 --> 02:00:20.970\nAll right,\nlet me just check my notes here,\n\n2136\n02:00:20.970 --> 02:00:22.250\nmake sure I didn't leave anything off.\n\n2137\n02:00:22.250 --> 02:00:24.580\nTalked about link names,\ntalked about ldconfig.\n\n2138\n02:00:26.500 --> 02:00:31.040\nLet's say that you're\nexperimenting with something, and\n\n2139\n02:00:31.040 --> 02:00:33.060\nyou want to add some libraries yourself.\n\n2140\n02:00:34.460 --> 02:00:36.610\nThere's two ways that you can go about it.\n\n2141\n02:00:36.610 --> 02:00:39.670\nOne way is you stick the library somewhere\non the hard drive and then you go and\n\n2142\n02:00:39.670 --> 02:00:42.480\nyou modify the ld.so.com file.\n\n2143\n02:00:42.480 --> 02:00:44.870\nYou just put that path in there, and\nyou say, here's the new path for\n\n2144\n02:00:44.870 --> 02:00:47.260\nsome libraries, right?\n\n2145\n02:00:47.260 --> 02:00:50.110\nAnother option is,\nyou can use ldconfig, so\n\n2146\n02:00:50.110 --> 02:00:55.090\nmaybe in my home directory\nI create a lib folder, and\n\n2147\n02:00:55.090 --> 02:00:58.550\nI'm gonna put some libraries in there for\nyou to experiment and play around with.\n\n2148\n02:00:58.550 --> 02:01:02.248\nAnd so, you can say ldconfig dash,\nis it -n?\n\n2149\n02:01:02.248 --> 02:01:08.470\nYeah, -n -n ~/lib, okay?\n\n2150\n02:01:08.470 --> 02:01:13.200\nSo, what that's gonna do is, it's gonna\nregister that folder as a new location for\n\n2151\n02:01:13.200 --> 02:01:16.970\nlibraries, and so\nnow I can stick library files in there and\n\n2152\n02:01:16.970 --> 02:01:18.980\nthe library database will\nbe updated with that.\n\n2153\n02:01:18.980 --> 02:01:22.410\nIt'll have those entries and\nI'll be able to reference them, all right?\n\n2154\n02:01:22.410 --> 02:01:25.310\nUseful if you're trying to\noverride certain versions or\n\n2155\n02:01:25.310 --> 02:01:28.180\nmake something available that\nmight not be part of your base OS.\n\n2156\n02:01:28.180 --> 02:01:30.560\nSo, that's just one other\nthing that's there.\n\n2157\n02:01:31.960 --> 02:01:34.250\nAll right, but\nother than that I think that wraps it up.\n\n2158\n02:01:34.250 --> 02:01:39.500\nJust remember for the exam the difference\nbetween hard link and soft links, right?\n\n2159\n02:01:39.500 --> 02:01:41.290\nHard links are actually\npointing to the data,\n\n2160\n02:01:41.290 --> 02:01:43.550\nthey're very efficient but fairly limited.\n\n2161\n02:01:43.550 --> 02:01:46.440\nSoft links are pointing to other pointers,\nso\n\n2162\n02:01:46.440 --> 02:01:50.040\nthey're very powerful but\nthey're less efficient.\n\n2163\n02:01:50.040 --> 02:01:55.550\nUse hard links whenever possible,\nonly use soft links if you have to.\n\n2164\n02:01:55.550 --> 02:01:58.570\nAll right, so I think that is about it,\nlet me just make sure I didn't miss\n\n2165\n02:01:58.570 --> 02:02:01.930\nanything else cuz I think we\nare actually done with file systems.\n\n2166\n02:02:01.930 --> 02:02:03.600\n>> Yeah, a lot of cool stuff.\n\n2167\n02:02:03.600 --> 02:02:04.200\nThat's impressive.\n\n2168\n02:02:04.200 -->

and good evening, and\n\n4\n00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.981\nwelcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:38.981 --> 00:00:40.870\nI'm your host, Don Pizet.\n\n6\n00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:42.920\nBack to you and Mr.\nRonnie Wong, how's it going, Ronnie?\n\n7\n00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.160\n>> I am very excited today.\n\n8\n00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.200\nThere's two pieces of\nincredible entertainment I use.\n\n9\n00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.900\n>> A double dose.\n\n10\n00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.870\n>> A double dose of entertainment news.\n\n11\n00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.290\nAmerican Idol has, of course,\nannounced its panel of judges,\n\n12\n00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.115\nwhich means everybody\nin the world's excited.\n\n13\n00:00:54.115 --> 00:00:55.670\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> Not really.\n\n14\n00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.130\nAnd then there is,\nof course, the slayer tour.\n\n15\n00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:00.030\nThey announced that they're coming back.\n\n16\n00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.680\n>> Wait a minute, so,\nwe've got American Idol and Slayer.\n\n17\n00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.510\nI think those are the first\ntwo signs of the apocalypse.\n\n18\n00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.260\n>> Yeah, two ends of the spectrum\nhere announcing on the same day.\n\n19\n00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:10.000\nI mean.\n\n20\n00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:10.986\n>> It's a sign.\n>> It is a sign.\n\n21\n00:01:10.986 --> 00:01:14.496\n>> All right, so the lesson to be had here\nis if you're gonna take your Linux Plus\n\n22\n00:01:14.496 --> 00:01:16.890\ncertification exams, take them fast-\n>> That's right.\n\n23\n00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.225\n>> Because the world is ending.\n\n24\n00:01:18.225 --> 00:01:23.470\n[LAUGH] Today, we're gonna be\njumping right back in Linux Plus.\n\n25\n00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:27.540\nWe're gonna be taking a look at our\nuser environment, our shell, or\n\n26\n00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.400\nour command line interface and\nthis is really important.\n\n27\n00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:35.040\nIf you're watching all of these\nepisodes synchronously, in order,\n\n28\n00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.090\nwhatever, serially.\n\n29\n00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.330\nIf you're watching all these episodes in\norder, this is the first one where we're\n\n30\n00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:45.825\njumping into topics from the second exam,\nfrom the LX0-102 exam.\n\n31\n00:01:45.825 --> 00:01:49.465\nSo everything else was on the first exam,\nnow we're moving into number two.\n\n32\n00:01:49.465 --> 00:01:53.965\nNow, we've been working in\nthe command line interface a lot.\n\n33\n00:01:53.965 --> 00:01:56.304\nSo why do we need another\nsection on the CLI?\n\n34\n00:01:56.304 --> 00:01:59.877\nAnd the reason is,\nwhile we've been working in the CLI,\n\n35\n00:01:59.877 --> 00:02:02.417\nwe haven't really customized it much.\n\n36\n00:02:02.417 --> 00:02:06.265\nAnd we're gonna see that there's actually\na lot of different things that we can do\n\n37\n00:02:06.265 --> 00:02:08.607\nto tweak our user interface,\ntweak our system and\n\n38\n00:02:08.607 --> 00:02:10.480\nmanipulate the way that it functions.\n\n39\n00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:12.898\nSo that's what we're gonna do today.\n\n40\n00:02:12.898 --> 00:02:17.617\nWe're also not just gonna look at\nthe CLI for working with Linux.\n\n41\n00:02:17.617 --> 00:02:21.232\nWe're gonna take a look at some other\ncommand line interfaces that we have like\n\n42\n00:02:21.232 --> 00:02:23.135\nwe have when we work with SQL databases.\n\n43\n00:02:23.135 --> 00:02:25.410\nSo we'll get a chance to see that as well.\n\n44\n00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.240\nThere was something else I'm forgetting.\n\n45\n00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.160\nScripting, we'll do some\nbasic scripting today.\n\n46\n00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.600\nSo that's always fun.\n\n47\n00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.180\nYou'd be surprised as an administrator\nhow often you script things.\n\n48\n00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.179\nKinda blurs the line between admin and\ndeveloper sometimes.\n\n49\n00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.048\nAlthough a developer\nwould never say that so.\n\n50\n00:02:41.048 --> 00:02:43.120\n[LAUGH] Your petty skills\nat scripting don't count.\n\n51\n00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.010\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So all right, so enough of that.\n\n52\n00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.100\nLet's go ahead and get started.\n\n53\n00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.870\nThe default command line interface for\n\n54\n00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:55.860\nmost Linux distributions is a prompt\ncalled the bash shell or bash prompt.\n\n55\n00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.650\nIt stands for born again shell.\n\n56\n00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.860\nThe original versions of Unix just\nhad what was called the shell, and\n\n57\n00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:03.760\nthat was it.\n\n58\n00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.740\nAnd it was powerful, and yet\nlimited at the same time.\n\n59\n00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:09.590\nThere were some things\nit just couldn't do.\n\n60\n00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.174\nAnd so over the years,\nthe shells have evolved.\n\n61\n00:03:12.174 --> 00:03:17.620\nAnd we've seen new ones like csh,\ntcsh, zsh, all these different ones.\n\n62\n00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.140\nAnd bash is the one that seems\nto become the most popular.\n\n63\n00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:26.480\nAnd so it's pretty much the de facto\nstandard on Linux distributions.\n\n64\n00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.970\nNow when we work in the bash shell,\nthere's some things that we get and\n\n65\n00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.210\nthings we've been using\nin this show already.\n\n66\n00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:34.360\nFor example our command history, right?\n\n67\n00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:39.510\nSo, when I log in and I get my shell\nprompt here, I can hit my up arrow and\n\n68\n00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.540\nI can start scrolling through some\nof the commands that I ran before.\n\n69\n00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.420\nAnd that's my command history.\n\n70\n00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:47.140\nWell it's actually bash\nthat makes that possible,\n\n71\n00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:51.190\nthat stores that command history that\npulls that information back for me.\n\n72\n00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:53.200\nAlso our prompt that we\nsee on the left side,\n\n73\n00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:58.500\nmy user name at host name and\nthen local path and all that.\n\n74\n00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.840\nThat is being rendered by\nbash to show me what's up.\n\n75\n00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.660\nOther commands like being\nable to use the pipe symbol.\n\n76\n00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:10.820\nSo where I can take d message and\npipe that into the tail command.\n\n77\n00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:14.500\nThat pipe, that ability to take the output\nof one command and feed it into another.\n\n78\n00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.010\nThat's another thing that bash\nis enabling me to do, so.\n\n79\n00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:21.400\nReally cool stuff that that\nshell makes possible for us.\n\n80\n00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:25.360\nNow, there are some interesting\nthings that can happen,\n\n81\n00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.240\nand I think I pointed this\nout in a previous show.\n\n82\n00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:31.910\nBut there are sometimes where we run\ncommands that we do very frequently.\n\n83\n00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:36.320\nAnd we might wanna change the way\nthey function by default.\n\n84\n00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.550\nWhile bash has a function\nin it called an alias.\n\n85\n00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:44.090\nAnd we can use aliases to modify\nthe way the commands work.\n\n86\n00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:47.820\nNow you guys have seen me throughout\nthe show where I'll do ls\n\n87\n00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:49.320\nto pull up a directory.\n\n88\n00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:50.860\nThere is my directory.\n\n89\n00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:52.810\nAnd it colorizes it, right?\n\n90\n00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:56.310\nSee how the word storage is in\nlight blue cuz it's a link?\n\n91\n00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:00.270\nWe've got tools.tgz is\nred cuz it's an archive.\n\n92\n00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:03.549\nThere's my folders, videos and\nvideos two that are a dark blue.\n\n93\n00:05:03.549 --> 00:05:06.420\nAnd that's been annoying me during\nthe show cuz I'll say well,\n\n94\n00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:08.348\nit's dark blue, it's kinda hard to see.\n\n95\n00:05:08.348 --> 00:05:11.783\nAnd even if I do an ls-la,\nwhich is what I normally do,\n\n96\n00:05:11.783 --> 00:05:16.489\nto say show me all the files and show them\nin a list format instead of a table or\n\n97\n00:05:16.489 --> 00:05:19.580\narray or whatever that is,\nshow them like this.\n\n98\n00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:21.169\nThis is what I normally do.\n\n99\n00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:22.428\nEven then it's still blue.\n\n100\n00:05:22.428 --> 00:05:27.657\nAnd so there's been a few times in\nthe episodes where I've done a ls-la and\n\n101\n00:05:27.657 --> 00:05:31.100\njust piped it through the more command.\n\n102\n00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:33.890\nJust because I know more\nwill strip the colors off.\n\n103\n00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:37.960\nAnd then so that's just a real quick\nway for me to strip those colors off.\n\n104\n00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:42.260\nSo let's say I hate the colors,\nand I just don't want them.\n\n105\n00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.650\nWhere are those colors coming from?\n\n106\n00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:47.538\nWell, the colors are actually coming from.\n\n107\n00:05:47.538 --> 00:05:54.818\nIf you were to run it,\nyou could run ls --color=auto, like that.\n\n108\n00:05:54.818 --> 00:06:00.160\nAnd when you say ls --color=auto,\nthat tells it to colorize the output.\n\n109\n00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:04.078\nWell I didn't type that,\nI didn't type --color=auto.\n\n110\n00:06:04.078 --> 00:06:10.010\nWhat's going on is there is an alias\nin my system right now that's saying,\n\n111\n00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:15.488\nwhenever you run ls, don't just run ls,\nrun LS --color=audio.\n\n112\n00:06:15.488 --> 00:06:17.494\nAnd if you run the alias command,\n\n113\n00:06:17.494 --> 00:06:20.798\nyou'll get a list of the aliases\nthat are put in place.\n\n114\n00:06:20.798 --> 00:06:24.098\nAnd so notice some of the ones\nthat I have in here, and\n\n115\n00:06:24.098 --> 00:06:26.420\nyou kinda spot ls right there.\n\n116\n00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:33.130\nWhen I run ls, instead of just running it,\nit's gonna run ls --color=auto.\n\n117\n00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:34.558\nAnd that may not be what I want.\n\n118\n00:06:34.558 --> 00:06:35.898\nI may wanna manipulate that.\n\n119\n00:06:35.898 --> 00:06:42.488\nThere's other ones like cp-i, which\nmakes the copy operations interactive.\n\n120\n00:06:42.488 --> 00:06:48.163\nIf you take look at the man page for cp,\nthe default function is that if we copy\n\n121\n00:06:48.163 --> 00:06:54.117\none file to a location where the file\nalready exists, it'll just override it.\n\n122\n00:06:54.117 --> 00:06:56.818\nBut cp-i will prompt you.\n\n123\n00:06:56.818 --> 00:06:57.916\nIf it's about to override,\n\n124\n00:06:57.916 --> 00:07:00.308\nit will prompt you and\nsay are you sure you want to override it?\n\n125\n00:07:00.308 --> 00:07:03.508\nWell maybe you don't want that and so\nyou could turn that function off too.\n\n126\n00:07:03.508 --> 00:07:07.188\nBut that's an alias that's\nbeen put in place here.\n\n127\n00:07:07.188 --> 00:07:13.488\nNow I'm running CentOS [COUGH] and\nin CentOS these are the default aliases.\n\n128\n00:07:13.488 --> 00:07:15.650\nI haven't modified at all.\n\n129\n00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:18.850\nYour distribution may use\ndifferent aliases, but\n\n130\n00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:24.050\nthey're very easy to configure and\ntweak and modify to suit our own needs.\n\n131\n00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:28.190\nThese aliases,\nthey're actually set in our user profile.\n\n132\n00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:32.580\nWhen a user logs in and\nfires up that shell for the first time,\n\n133\n00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:37.140\ntheir configuration is actually loaded\nfrom a number of different places.\n\n134\n00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:40.450\nAnd so I wanna take a look at those, the\ndifferent places our default configuration\n\n135\n00:07:40.450 --> 00:07:43.388\ncomes from, and\nhow we can kind of manipulate that.\n\n136\n00:07:43.388 --> 00:07:48.030\nNow, [COUGH] I'm logged in as the root\nuser right now, so I'm the super admin for\n\n137\n00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:49.180\nthis system.\n\n138\n00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:53.849\nAnd as the super admin, I have\nthe ability to change my own settings,\n\n139\n00:07:53.849 --> 00:07:58.130\nas well as to change the system-wide\nsettings for the system.\n\n140\n00:07:58.130 --> 00:08:03.102\nA normal user can only modify settings for\nthemselves, for their own profile, and\n\n141\n00:08:03.102 --> 00:08:03.892\nthat's it.\n\n142\n00:08:03.892 --> 00:08:07.501\nAll right, but let's take a look at\na few of the files that are involved.\n\n143\n00:08:07.501 --> 00:08:11.638\nWhen it comes to bash,\nwhenever I fire up a bash prompt,\n\n144\n00:08:11.638 --> 00:08:16.310\na few different things\nare running in the background.\n\n145\n00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:21.579\nOne of the things is,\nthe system will look for\n\n146\n00:08:21.579 --> 00:08:26.724\na file called /etc/profile, all right?\n\n147\n00:08:26.724 --> 00:08:35.550\n/etc/profile, this guy right here, is\nthe default system-wide profile for users.\n\n148\n00:08:35.550 --> 00:08:38.990\nIf we wanna manipulate\nsomething as a default for\n\n149\n00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:43.900\npeople's shells, we can put it in this\nfile, and it will affect all of our users.\n\n150\n00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:45.870\nOkay, now, notice what it says here.\n\n151\n00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:49.800\nIt's not a good idea to change this\nfile unless you know what you're doing.\n\n152\n00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:51.520\nYou could say that's true of any file.\n\n153\n00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:55.260\nBut more so here because if\nyou mess up people's shells,\n\n154\n00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:58.330\nyou mess up your own also\nthis applies to root.\n\n155\n00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:01.160\nAnd so you could potentially make\nthe system unusable and then you've\n\n156\n00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:04.080\ngotta try to recover, so that's\ndefinitely something we don't want to do.\n\n157\n00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:07.830\nYou'll see there's stuff in here,\nlike our path is set.\n\n158\n00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:11.720\nWhen we run a program you can just\ntype a program name like, LS.\n\n159\n00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:15.000\nWe don't have to tell Linux\nwhere the LS executable is.\n\n160\n00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.280\nBecause it's gonna go through and\nsearch the path to try and find it for us.\n\n161\n00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:20.630\nWell, there's nothing really here.\n\n162\n00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:22.280\nIt's just loading variables, but\n\n163\n00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:28.330\nif we wanted to add to that path\nwe could easily do it right here.\n\n164\n00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:30.790\nOther things that you'll see,\nit's going through and\n\n165\n00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:35.730\npicking up username, picking up mail\nif the user has an email account.\n\n166\n00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:40.220\nYou'll see it's manipulating that path\nright here, where it's saying We're adding\n\n167\n00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:46.990\non to the path, adding /bin, /user/sbin,\n/user/local/sbin, and so on.\n\n168\n00:09:46.990 --> 00:09:50.550\nSo attaching each of those to the path,\nso that when we run a program,\n\n169\n00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:52.600\nit's gonna look in all these\ndifferent directories.\n\n170\n00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:57.560\nYou'll also see it's populating\nour system variables.\n\n171\n00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:03.650\nSo our host name, our history size, all\nof that stuff is coming right from here.\n\n172\n00:10:03.650 --> 00:10:06.220\nThe umask, we talked about\nthe umask in another episode,\n\n173\n00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:07.750\nthe default file permissions.\n\n174\n00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:12.540\nThey're coming from here, right from this\nprofile and it's being loaded again for\n\n175\n00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:14.560\nthe system as a whole.\n\n176\n00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:17.300\nAll right.\n\n177\n00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:18.470\nSo lots of good stuff in there.\n\n178\n00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:23.790\nAlso, you'll notice this\none line right here.\n\n179\n00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:27.050\nWhich says for I in /etc/profile.d/*.sh.\n\n180\n00:10:27.050 --> 00:10:27.600\nAll right.\n\n181\n00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:28.200\nWhat is that?\n\n182\n00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:31.310\nWell, these are like start up scripts.\n\n183\n00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:34.830\nThat's actually a folder, profile,d.\n\n184\n00:10:34.830 --> 00:10:38.770\nSo if I change into that and\n\n185\n00:10:38.770 --> 00:10:44.450\ntake a look you'll see there's\na bunch of .sh, .csh files, right?\n\n186\n00:10:44.450 --> 00:10:49.570\nThese are our basically scripts that\nwill run either when our system boot or\n\n187\n00:10:49.570 --> 00:10:51.250\nthat we invoke manually.\n\n188\n00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:54.750\nSo you'll see like some midnight commander\nmodifications in there, colorls and\n\n189\n00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:58.900\na few other ones, vim, you know depending\non what you've installed you'll see\n\n190\n00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:00.350\ndifferent things in here.\n\n191\n00:11:00.350 --> 00:11:03.870\nThese are scripts that are now\nattached to our shell.\n\n192\n00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:07.040\nThe SH ones, those are for\nthe standard shell, and for bash.\n\n193\n00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:11.670\nThe CSH ones, those are for the C shell,\nand you'll see a lot of duplicates there.\n\n194\n00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:14.039\nThey're just slightly modified\nbased on the shell that you need.\n\n195\n00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:17.130\nSo all of those scripts, again,\n\n196\n00:11:17.130 --> 00:11:21.210\nare kinda becoming a part of\nthat system wide profile.\n\n197\n00:11:23.270 --> 00:11:25.720\nNow that's just the mine stuff.\n\n198\n00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:30.260\nIf I wanna make a change that affects\neverybody, I do it with system wide stuff,\n\n199\n00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.690\nthe slash etc slash profile.\n\n200\n00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:35.170\nBut what if I just want to\nmake a change for myself?\n\n201\n00:11:35.170 --> 00:11:35.780\nAll right.\n\n202\n00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:41.280\nWell, everybody maintains\ntheir own profile file, right?\n\n203\n00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:43.263\nSo /etc/profile, that's for everybody.\n\n204\n00:11:43.263 --> 00:11:50.310\nBut ~/.profile,\nall right ~/ that means my home directory.\n\n205\n00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:52.590\nSo whatever my home directory is,\nin there,\n\n206\n00:11:52.590 --> 00:11:55.510\nthere should be a file called dot Profile,\nright?\n\n207\n00:11:55.510 --> 00:12:00.720\nAnd that file will be the customizations\nthat apply just to me, all right?\n\n208\n00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:03.210\nSo, or actually I don't seem to have one.\n\n209\n00:12:03.210 --> 00:12:04.400\nYou don't have to have one.\n\n210\n00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:05.680\nIf you don't have a dot profile,\n\n211\n00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:08.320\nthat means you're just using\nthe system wide on and that's it.\n\n212\n00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:12.860\nYou could create a profile called .profile\nand then put your overrides in there.\n\n213\n00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:19.160\nSo looking at mine right now if I change\ninto my home directory and I do an ls-la I\n\n214\n00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:26.200\ncan see that sure enough,\nyeah I do not have a .profile file.\n\n215\n00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:30.910\nOkay, but if I take a look at another\nuser like my individual user account,\n\n216\n00:12:30.910 --> 00:12:32.580\nall right?\n\n217\n00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:34.850\nI'm just looking at the my dpezet account.\n\n218\n00:12:34.850 --> 00:12:39.020\nIt doesn't have one either so\nit's no overrides on the profile,\n\n219\n00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:44.100\nat least on that particular file and\nwe're just accepting the system wide one.\n\n220\n00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:48.980\nIf I wanted to do overrides all I\nhave to do is in my home directory,\n\n221\n00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:51.640\nI can create a file\nthat we'll just called.\n\n222\n00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:53.400\nProfile.\n\n223\n00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:57.730\nPutting a dot at the beginning\nof the name says to hide it.\n\n224\n00:12:57.730 --> 00:12:59.880\nAny file with a dot before\nthe name will be hidden so\n\n225\n00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:03.950\nif I just do a ls,\nI don't see that file that I just made.\n\n226\n00:13:03.950 --> 00:13:09.580\nBut if I do an ls -a,\nI'll now see that .profile,\n\n227\n00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:12.210\nfile, if I can free up my mouse.\n\n228\n00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:15.124\nWhat have I done?\n\n229\n00:13:15.124 --> 00:13:19.590\n[LAUGH]\n>> I know, apparently my mouse is stuck.\n\n230\n00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:21.510\nAll right, well, so\nI won't forget my mouse.\n\n231\n00:13:21.510 --> 00:13:23.120\nBut you can see it right\nthere above my prompt,\n\n232\n00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:25.930\nunderneath process.text,\nyou'll see .profile.\n\n233\n00:13:25.930 --> 00:13:27.200\nAnd there it is.\n\n234\n00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:29.140\nIt's just a hidden file.\n\n235\n00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:34.200\nAnd now I can put statements in there and\nthey will override, or add to, right?\n\n236\n00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:39.654\nYou can add to or override the main\nprofile file that's in /etc/profile.\n\n237\n00:13:41.430 --> 00:13:44.750\nAlright, you might haven\nnoticed another file that\n\n238\n00:13:44.750 --> 00:13:47.880\nis in there dot bash underscore profile.\n\n239\n00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:48.700\nAlright?\n\n240\n00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:52.020\nThe cool thing about slash ctc slash\nprofile is that it takes effects\n\n241\n00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:54.620\nregardless of which shell you use.\n\n242\n00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:58.640\nAll right, but bash_profile, that just\ntakes effect when you're using bash.\n\n243\n00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:02.120\nIt's the default shell, so\nyou might as well make use of that.\n\n244\n00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:05.516\nAnd I do have a bash_profile.\n\n245\n00:14:05.516 --> 00:14:10.369\nAnd so if I edit that, I can\n\n246\n00:14:10.369 --> 00:14:13.460\nsee that I do have a little bit in here,\nnot much, right?\n\n247\n00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:16.610\nI can see where I've added\nto my path $HOME/bin.\n\n248\n00:14:16.610 --> 00:14:21.320\nI think we did that in One of the earlier\nepisodes, I had made a script and\n\n249\n00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:22.460\nstuck it in there.\n\n250\n00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:23.770\nAnd so I added it to my path.\n\n251\n00:14:23.770 --> 00:14:28.150\nSee how it says user specific\nenvironment in startup programs.\n\n252\n00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:29.340\nYou can put things in there,\n\n253\n00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:34.380\nlike any variables that you want set when\nyou log in, and, you can execute programs.\n\n254\n00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:37.700\nIf you have any programs that you\nwant to run when you first log in,\n\n255\n00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:39.790\nyou can put them in here,\nyour start up programs.\n\n256\n00:14:39.790 --> 00:14:43.860\nSo whenever you log in,\nand access a bash Shell,\n\n257\n00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:47.180\nyou'll start to have this happen,\nwhatever's specified in here.\n\n258\n00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:56.290\nNotice up at the top that it is pulling\ninformation from .bashrc, bashrc,\n\n259\n00:14:56.290 --> 00:15:01.640\nthat's the configuration file for\nthe bash cli itself for the BASH shell.\n\n260\n00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:07.290\nAnd so we can always take a look at that\ntoo, more information coming from there.\n\n261\n00:15:07.290 --> 00:15:14.290\nSo if I pull that file up, that's where\nsome of my aliases are coming from.\n\n262\n00:15:14.290 --> 00:15:20.030\nNotice how I've got alias rm rm -i,\ncp cp -i, mv mv -i.\n\n263\n00:15:20.030 --> 00:15:24.510\nSo, making all of those interactive\nright here with my own user alias.\n\n264\n00:15:24.510 --> 00:15:28.500\nNow that's not all of the aliases that\nwere defined, but that's some of them,\n\n265\n00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:29.390\nand we can add our own.\n\n266\n00:15:29.390 --> 00:15:33.320\nSo those are user specific aliases\nthat we can feed in there.\n\n267\n00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:34.910\nWhat about the other ones, though?\n\n268\n00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:41.410\nI don't see the ls -la, or, sorry, was ls\n--color equals auto, I don't see that.\n\n269\n00:15:41.410 --> 00:15:46.943\nWell, again we see right\ndown here /etc/bashrc.\n\n270\n00:15:46.943 --> 00:15:54.130\nSo, ~/.bashrc that's the one in my\nfolder that applies to me and only me.\n\n271\n00:15:54.130 --> 00:16:01.697\nBut /etc/bashrc,\nthat applies to everybody.\n\n272\n00:16:01.697 --> 00:16:04.397\nAnd in here, if I take a look at it,\n\n273\n00:16:04.397 --> 00:16:08.786\nI should see that alias for\nLS Buried in here somewhere.\n\n274\n00:16:12.526 --> 00:16:13.680\nAnd you know I didn't see it.\n\n275\n00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:15.942\nDid I skip over it?\n\n276\n00:16:15.942 --> 00:16:17.650\nIt might have been in\none of the other files.\n\n277\n00:16:17.650 --> 00:16:19.470\nThis is one of the challenges\nwith these files.\n\n278\n00:16:19.470 --> 00:16:23.030\nThere's so many different files\ninvolved with your profile\n\n279\n00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:26.730\nthat your data could come from any\nof a number of different places.\n\n280\n00:16:26.730 --> 00:16:31.558\nSo when you're trying to find somewhere,\nit can be difficult to find\n\n281\n00:16:31.558 --> 00:16:36.567\nwhere it is set, and I'm not seeing\nthe actual color alias set in here.\n\n282\n00:16:39.942 --> 00:16:41.650\nWell, it doesn't matter.\n\n283\n00:16:41.650 --> 00:16:43.310\nIf we want to override it,\n\n284\n00:16:43.310 --> 00:16:46.070\nit's really just the last one that\napplies that we need to worry about.\n\n285\n00:16:46.070 --> 00:16:49.810\nAnd if the ones that apply to our profile,\nthose are the last ones that apply.\n\n286\n00:16:49.810 --> 00:16:53.360\nSo if I wanna override\nthat behavior of ls,\n\n287\n00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:57.890\nI can do that through my own bash\nconfiguration file, all right?\n\n288\n00:16:57.890 --> 00:16:59.890\nNow, most of these deal with log on,\nright?\n\n289\n00:16:59.890 --> 00:17:03.980\nSo when you log in, these various files\nare queried to build up your session.\n\n290\n00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:08.450\nThere are log out ones also and\nif you look in your home directory or\n\n291\n00:17:08.450 --> 00:17:12.380\nwhatever There.\n\n292\n00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:18.453\nYou'll see where I've got bash_profile,\nas well as bash_logout, all right.\n\n293\n00:17:18.453 --> 00:17:23.380\nbash_logout says what to do when\nI actually log out of this shell.\n\n294\n00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:25.692\nAnd there's not normally much in there.\n\n295\n00:17:28.733 --> 00:17:31.760\nIn fact, it's empty so\nmine just has a hashmark.\n\n296\n00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:33.200\nAnd it lets me know what the file name is.\n\n297\n00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:33.790\nAnd that's it, so\n\n298\n00:17:33.790 --> 00:17:36.960\nI don't actually have any logout\nprocedures to find for my account.\n\n299\n00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:41.110\nBut if you wana have that, if you wanna\nhave some series of events that happens.\n\n300\n00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:44.540\nLog assist, log message, or\nsomething like that when you log out,\n\n301\n00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:47.160\nyou can put those trigger\nevents right in here, right?\n\n302\n00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:49.560\nOr it can be something as simple\nas just saying, have a great day.\n\n303\n00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:52.080\nYou can have a message like that pop up.\n\n304\n00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:56.500\nSo these are all different files\ninvolved in our user profile.\n\n305\n00:17:56.500 --> 00:18:00.170\nAnd let me switch over to my show\nnotes here, whoop wrong notes.\n\n306\n00:18:00.170 --> 00:18:01.610\nThese guys, all right.\n\n307\n00:18:01.610 --> 00:18:06.100\nSo I kind of laid out some of these\ndifferent files just so we have them.\n\n308\n00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:09.180\nThat's actually a typo,\ngo ahead and pull that out.\n\n309\n00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:14.540\nAll right, so when it comes to login\nscripts when you login at the system level\n\n310\n00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:19.505\nit's looking at /etc/profile and\n/etc/profile.d/*\n\n311\n00:18:19.505 --> 00:18:24.370\nthat's actually being called from\ninside of this profile file.\n\n312\n00:18:25.570 --> 00:18:29.870\nAnd then it looked for\noverrides on your individual account.\n\n313\n00:18:29.870 --> 00:18:36.160\nA .profile, or a .bash_profile where\nwe can override those settings, right?\n\n314\n00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:41.338\nAs far as the bash configuration itself,\nthe systemwide settings come\n\n315\n00:18:41.338 --> 00:18:47.650\nfrom /etc/bashrc and the individual\nsettings come from ~/.bashrc, all right.\n\n316\n00:18:47.650 --> 00:18:54.170\nAnd then the logout script\nis that ~/.bash_logout.\n\n317\n00:18:54.170 --> 00:18:59.240\nAll of these files together are what's\nbuilt up our environment and customized.\n\n318\n00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:02.500\nSo as a root user, as a super user,\nyou may choose to go and\n\n319\n00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:07.686\nmake modifications to these system wide\nfiles so it affects all of your users.\n\n320\n00:19:07.686 --> 00:19:10.700\nIf it's something big,\nif it's something you really wanna change,\n\n321\n00:19:10.700 --> 00:19:16.010\nlike the amount of history that's saved\nfor each user, you modify it there.\n\n322\n00:19:16.010 --> 00:19:20.115\nBut if it's a personal preference, if\nit's me, right, and I hate the colored ls\n\n323\n00:19:20.115 --> 00:19:25.145\nprompts, then I might want to override\nthat alias by popping it into\n\n324\n00:19:25.145 --> 00:19:31.065\none of these other files to override that\ndefault alias that's put in the system.\n\n325\n00:19:31.065 --> 00:19:35.030\nOkay and so we can do that pretty easily\nby sticking them in there, right?\n\n326\n00:19:35.030 --> 00:19:38.554\nWe can also modify\nthings like the path and\n\n327\n00:19:38.554 --> 00:19:41.984\nthat's what I put it in the notes there.\n\n328\n00:19:43.609 --> 00:19:46.276\nAll right, so taking a look at\nlike my bash-profile, whops.\n\n329\n00:19:50.110 --> 00:19:50.860\nWhich,\n\n330\n00:20:00.901 --> 00:20:03.890\nIf I take a look at my bash_profile,\nI see I left a period out.\n\n331\n00:20:03.890 --> 00:20:05.075\nI knew I spelled it right.\n\n332\n00:20:05.075 --> 00:20:08.460\n[LAUGH] If I take a look at my\nbash_profile, I can come in here,\n\n333\n00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:09.120\nI can see that path.\n\n334\n00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:11.370\nYou can see where I modified it there.\n\n335\n00:20:11.370 --> 00:20:14.310\nThat's modifying it just for me, right?\n\n336\n00:20:14.310 --> 00:20:18.280\nNo other user is gonna search\ntheir $HOME/bin, it's just for me.\n\n337\n00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:23.350\nAnd that's why I didn't mind using\na variable like / or $HOME, right?\n\n338\n00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:27.518\nIf I were to put this in the system wide\nsetting, then all of the other users when\n\n339\n00:20:27.518 --> 00:20:31.878\nthey log in, anytime they ran a command\nit would also look to their $HOME/bin and\n\n340\n00:20:31.878 --> 00:20:35.442\nthat's not necessarily something\nI'd want at the system level.\n\n341\n00:20:35.442 --> 00:20:38.730\nBut here at the user level,\nthat might be fine.\n\n342\n00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:43.584\nAnd if we take a look at\nthat .bashrc right in here,\n\n343\n00:20:43.584 --> 00:20:48.442\nwe can see these aliases and I can go in\nand I can start to override some things.\n\n344\n00:20:50.660 --> 00:20:56.442\nSo I can put in a new alias saying\nthat I wanna default to ls-la.\n\n345\n00:20:56.442 --> 00:21:00.944\nI don't wanna the color auto [INAUDIBLE],\nI'm gonna leave that off, so\n\n346\n00:21:00.944 --> 00:21:02.984\nit's just ls -la, like that.\n\n347\n00:21:02.984 --> 00:21:06.640\n>> Now Don, are those single quotes or\nis that the back tick that you're typing-\n\n348\n00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:07.590\n>> It's the apostrophe.\n\n349\n00:21:07.590 --> 00:21:11.568\n>> Okay, it's the apostrophe.\n\n350\n00:21:11.568 --> 00:21:13.240\n>> Yeah, so\njust kinda punching that in there.\n\n351\n00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:16.140\nNow, these do take effect at logon, right?\n\n352\n00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:19.251\nSo, if you make a modification like\nthat it doesn't take effect right away.\n\n353\n00:21:19.251 --> 00:21:22.442\nRight actually whoops,\n[LAUGH] I hope that might have been wiki.\n\n354\n00:21:22.442 --> 00:21:27.521\nSo, I can see that it hasn't taken effect,\nbut if I log out and\n\n355\n00:21:27.521 --> 00:21:31.720\nlog back in now when I do an ls\nsee how it went ahead and\n\n356\n00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:37.235\nautomatically did I just ran ls,\nand it did ls-la without color.\n\n357\n00:21:37.235 --> 00:21:41.789\nBecause I've overridden the alias,\nand if I run the alias command,\n\n358\n00:21:41.789 --> 00:21:47.200\nI can see right in there alias ls,\nand see how it sent more than once.\n\n359\n00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:52.590\nNo, actually it's not, so\nthere's ll to default to the long color.\n\n360\n00:21:52.590 --> 00:21:54.800\nls to default to what I just did.\n\n361\n00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:57.290\nI overrode the default one in the system.\n\n362\n00:21:57.290 --> 00:22:01.830\nI can still use that other one, ll,\nand there we get it long with color.\n\n363\n00:22:01.830 --> 00:22:04.510\nBut my ls is long without color, right?\n\n364\n00:22:04.510 --> 00:22:06.990\nSo you can tweak this all\njust to meet your needs.\n\n365\n00:22:06.990 --> 00:22:09.235\nAnd you'll find that people\ndo this over time, right.\n\n366\n00:22:09.235 --> 00:22:13.085\nOver time you start to learn\nwhat you prefer, and so on, and\n\n367\n00:22:13.085 --> 00:22:15.620\nyou start to manipulate it.\n\n368\n00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:18.740\nI personally,\nI've worked on so many systems\n\n369\n00:22:18.740 --> 00:22:23.460\nthat I get tired of having to do a bunch\nof customizations when I first log in.\n\n370\n00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:24.680\nLike great, a new system.\n\n371\n00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:28.220\nLet me go change my prop, change my\ncoloring, change this, change that.\n\n372\n00:22:28.220 --> 00:22:29.090\nIt gets old, right.\n\n373\n00:22:29.090 --> 00:22:32.290\nI used to actually create a little\ntemplate file that I saved, and\n\n374\n00:22:32.290 --> 00:22:34.030\nI would just copy and paste it.\n\n375\n00:22:34.030 --> 00:22:38.460\nBut over the last few years, really about\nthree years ago, I finally just, I broke.\n\n376\n00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:40.070\nAnd I said all right, fine, you know what?\n\n377\n00:22:40.070 --> 00:22:41.830\nI'm gonna start sticking\nwith the defaults.\n\n378\n00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:43.650\nAnd if I don't like the color,\n\n379\n00:22:43.650 --> 00:22:45.610\nI'll just pipe it through the more\ncommand and get rid of it.\n\n380\n00:22:45.610 --> 00:22:49.720\nYou know so there's different things\nlike that that you can do and and\n\n381\n00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:53.340\nit just kind of simplifies\nlife a little bit.\n\n382\n00:22:53.340 --> 00:22:55.910\nThat way I don't have to customize\nsystems when I sit down on it.\n\n383\n00:22:55.910 --> 00:22:58.370\nBut for the exam we need to\nbe aware of how to do it and\n\n384\n00:22:58.370 --> 00:23:00.340\nif it's your own personal machine\nyou might as well customize it.\n\n385\n00:23:00.340 --> 00:23:01.310\nMake yourself happy you know.\n\n386\n00:23:01.310 --> 00:23:06.820\nMake it an environment that you\nenjoy working in, all right.\n\n387\n00:23:06.820 --> 00:23:10.680\nCouple of other things that\nwe need to be aware of.\n\n388\n00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:13.930\nVariables, we can define\na lot of variables.\n\n389\n00:23:13.930 --> 00:23:16.550\nIn fact,\nwe saw in some of those files earlier\n\n390\n00:23:16.550 --> 00:23:20.640\nthat if you run the set command you'll\nsee all the variables that are defined.\n\n391\n00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:25.330\nSome of those are defined\nby the /etc/profile,\n\n392\n00:23:25.330 --> 00:23:30.350\nyou might define some variables of your\nown, inside of your own bashrc or,\n\n393\n00:23:30.350 --> 00:23:34.060\nyou know, ~/.profile, somewhere like that.\n\n394\n00:23:34.060 --> 00:23:37.055\nYou can define your own variables if you,\nwant, right?\n\n395\n00:23:37.055 --> 00:23:38.755\nWhen you define variables,\n\n396\n00:23:38.755 --> 00:23:43.115\nif it's a part of your login script,\nthey get run, they get created.\n\n397\n00:23:43.115 --> 00:23:44.815\nThey're always gonna be there for\nyou, and you can use them.\n\n398\n00:23:44.815 --> 00:23:46.045\nIt;s great, all right?\n\n399\n00:23:46.045 --> 00:23:51.100\nIf you create them on the fly,\nthey're actually tied to your session,\n\n400\n00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:53.470\nand so when you log out and\nlog back in, they're gone.\n\n401\n00:23:53.470 --> 00:23:57.307\nAnd so it is kinda useful to have them in\nthese files, to make them available there.\n\n402\n00:23:57.307 --> 00:24:02.587\nAnother thing to be aware of though\nis when you create variables,\n\n403\n00:24:02.587 --> 00:24:07.388\nthere's different ways\nthe distributions can handle it.\n\n404\n00:24:07.388 --> 00:24:12.777\nIn CentOS, when you create a variable, the\ndefault is to create a global variable.\n\n405\n00:24:12.777 --> 00:24:15.174\nAnd what I mean by that is,\nlike here I am,\n\n406\n00:24:15.174 --> 00:24:19.028\nI'm the root user, I'm in a bash prompt,\nright, I can run bash.\n\n407\n00:24:19.028 --> 00:24:23.354\nAnd what I actually just did is\nI launched a second bash prompt.\n\n408\n00:24:23.354 --> 00:24:27.040\nAnd so if I run ps,\nsee how I've got two bashes?\n\n409\n00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:31.360\nAnd if I hit exit and I run ps,\nnow I've only got one bash, right?\n\n410\n00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:34.077\nSo I'm in the bash shell right now.\n\n411\n00:24:34.077 --> 00:24:41.018\nAnd if I say bash again, now I'm in\na completely separate bash shell, right?\n\n412\n00:24:41.018 --> 00:24:45.513\nAnd if I say something like\n\n413\n00:24:45.513 --> 00:24:50.219\nlastname=pezet, okay?\n\n414\n00:24:50.219 --> 00:24:55.660\nNow I can do an echo $lastname and\nthere's my variable, pezet, right?\n\n415\n00:24:55.660 --> 00:24:58.880\nSo, I just created a variable and\nthere it is.\n\n416\n00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:03.080\nNow, there are global variables and\nthere are local variables.\n\n417\n00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:07.380\nA local variable is one that's tied\njust to this particular shell,\n\n418\n00:25:07.380 --> 00:25:11.460\nand if I exit this shell,\nthe variable is gone.\n\n419\n00:25:11.460 --> 00:25:15.970\nA global one on the other hand,\nis attached to my session, and so\n\n420\n00:25:15.970 --> 00:25:20.390\nregardless of which shell I'm in,\nthat variable will still be there, right?\n\n421\n00:25:20.390 --> 00:25:25.500\nSo if I type exit to get out of this bash\nshell, now I'm back in my original one.\n\n422\n00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:31.290\nAnd if I type echo $lastname,\nI get nothing, okay?\n\n423\n00:25:31.290 --> 00:25:35.622\nI didn't get it because it was tied to\nthat other shell which I just closed,\n\n424\n00:25:35.622 --> 00:25:36.510\nall right?\n\n425\n00:25:36.510 --> 00:25:40.570\nThat's the default for a lot of Linux\ndistributions that are out there,\n\n426\n00:25:40.570 --> 00:25:44.690\nthat when you create variables like these,\nthey are local variables.\n\n427\n00:25:44.690 --> 00:25:45.590\nAnd for most users,\n\n428\n00:25:45.590 --> 00:25:48.490\nthey don't really think twice about\nit cuz you're only logged in once.\n\n429\n00:25:48.490 --> 00:25:51.700\nBut if you log into a system\nmore than once, yeah, yeah,\n\n430\n00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:52.730\nI'm really bad about this.\n\n431\n00:25:52.730 --> 00:25:57.310\nI will have multiple SSH sessions or\nI will,\n\n432\n00:25:57.310 --> 00:25:59.700\nif I'm sitting at the machine,\nI'll use my ttys, right?\n\n433\n00:25:59.700 --> 00:26:01.940\nRemember you can do the Alt+F1, Alt+F2,\n\n434\n00:26:01.940 --> 00:26:05.760\nall the way through Alt+F6\nto switch between the ttys.\n\n435\n00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:08.530\nIf you do that and\nyou set a variable in one,\n\n436\n00:26:08.530 --> 00:26:12.640\nyou don't see it in the others cuz\nthey're different shells, all right?\n\n437\n00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:16.032\nSo in those scenarios, if you're gonna\nbe using variables like that and\n\n438\n00:26:16.032 --> 00:26:20.020\nyou're worried about that bleed over\nbetween the shells if you need that.\n\n439\n00:26:20.020 --> 00:26:24.580\nYou can convert a variable from\na local variable to a global\n\n440\n00:26:24.580 --> 00:26:27.360\nvariable by doing what's\ncalled exporting it.\n\n441\n00:26:28.540 --> 00:26:31.770\nIf I get back into\na separate bash prompt and\n\n442\n00:26:31.770 --> 00:26:37.300\nI say lastname = pezet, right?\n\n443\n00:26:37.300 --> 00:26:40.260\nI can then say, export lastname.\n\n444\n00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:44.110\nAnd that's gonna convert\nthe lastname variable from\n\n445\n00:26:44.110 --> 00:26:46.670\na local variable to a global variable.\n\n446\n00:26:46.670 --> 00:26:51.403\nAnd now my other shells that are out\nthere will be able to see that.\n\n447\n00:26:51.403 --> 00:26:56.732\nAnd so if I drop back to my other shell,\n\n448\n00:26:56.732 --> 00:27:00.164\nand I echo $lastname.\n\n449\n00:27:00.164 --> 00:27:02.533\nShoot, it's being overridden\nby the system, dadgummit.\n\n450\n00:27:02.533 --> 00:27:04.666\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, it becomes a global and\n\n451\n00:27:04.666 --> 00:27:07.970\nthen it becomes available\nin the other prompt.\n\n452\n00:27:07.970 --> 00:27:11.170\nIt's being overridden here,\nso you can define it.\n\n453\n00:27:11.170 --> 00:27:14.260\nYou can do it manually by using the export\ncommand like I was trying to do.\n\n454\n00:27:14.260 --> 00:27:18.509\nYou can also override it in your profile,\nand that must be what's happening here.\n\n455\n00:27:18.509 --> 00:27:20.279\nAll right,\nI don't know what the default is for\n\n456\n00:27:20.279 --> 00:27:22.320\nCentOS, apparently it is to override it.\n\n457\n00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:23.896\nSo, you can override this.\n\n458\n00:27:23.896 --> 00:27:28.735\nThere's a little command which,\ndid I put that, yeah.\n\n459\n00:27:28.735 --> 00:27:32.331\nThere's a little command we can use to\nmodify the way that set works when it\n\n460\n00:27:32.331 --> 00:27:34.270\ncomes to setting variables.\n\n461\n00:27:34.270 --> 00:27:41.030\nAnd it's set -o exportall, okay?\n\n462\n00:27:41.030 --> 00:27:45.114\nWhen you run that, apparently not,\n\n463\n00:27:45.114 --> 00:27:49.078\nlet me just pull up the syntax here.\n\n464\n00:27:49.078 --> 00:27:50.945\nApparently I've got it wrong.\n\n465\n00:27:50.945 --> 00:27:53.267\nYou know, actually,\n\n466\n00:27:59.815 --> 00:28:01.603\nHas this command changed?\n\n467\n00:28:01.603 --> 00:28:03.251\n[LAUGH] That's always pleasant.\n\n468\n00:28:03.251 --> 00:28:04.352\n>> Yeah.\n\n469\n00:28:04.352 --> 00:28:08.518\n>> Yeah, I, whoops,\njust scrolled right past it, there we go.\n\n470\n00:28:08.518 --> 00:28:13.566\nExport, [SOUND] export p.\n\n471\n00:28:13.566 --> 00:28:15.795\nThey don't show it,\nI might have to look this one up.\n\n472\n00:28:15.795 --> 00:28:20.351\nWhat I'm used to, and like I said,\nI don't normally have to do this,\n\n473\n00:28:20.351 --> 00:28:22.227\nis to do a set -o exportall.\n\n474\n00:28:22.227 --> 00:28:25.830\nAnd what that does is it flips a little\noption in the set command that says\n\n475\n00:28:25.830 --> 00:28:29.350\nwhen I create a variable from now on,\njust automatically export it.\n\n476\n00:28:29.350 --> 00:28:31.360\nDon't make me have to export it.\n\n477\n00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:34.014\nIf I create a variable,\nI wanna create a global.\n\n478\n00:28:34.014 --> 00:28:37.564\nAnd, in many Linux distributions,\nthat's actually the default.\n\n479\n00:28:37.564 --> 00:28:38.841\nIn this one, it isn't.\n\n480\n00:28:38.841 --> 00:28:42.010\nAnd so\nwe can use that set -o exportall to do it.\n\n481\n00:28:42.010 --> 00:28:43.738\nNow I'm getting a syntax error on mine.\n\n482\n00:28:43.738 --> 00:28:45.665\nSo I'm gonna have to look that up and\nfind out what's going there.\n\n483\n00:28:45.665 --> 00:28:47.745\nCuz I'm pretty sure I've got that right.\n\n484\n00:28:47.745 --> 00:28:50.911\n[LAUGH] no, I'm a moron.\n\n485\n00:28:50.911 --> 00:28:54.803\nIt's set -o allexport.\n\n486\n00:28:54.803 --> 00:28:55.416\nThere we go.\n\n487\n00:28:55.416 --> 00:28:59.728\n[LAUGH] I was close,\nI almost had that command from memory.\n\n488\n00:28:59.728 --> 00:29:03.348\nset -o allexport, there we go.\n\n489\n00:29:03.348 --> 00:29:06.667\nAnd that's gonna say from now\non when I create a variable,\n\n490\n00:29:06.667 --> 00:29:09.803\ndon't make me have to export it,\njust make it global.\n\n491\n00:29:09.803 --> 00:29:12.871\nAnd that way, if I'm in one shell and\nI jump to another shell,\n\n492\n00:29:12.871 --> 00:29:15.883\nthat it'll be available and\nI'll be able to query that one.\n\n493\n00:29:15.883 --> 00:29:18.940\nAll right, sorry about that, guys.\n\n494\n00:29:18.940 --> 00:29:23.097\nSometimes I try and do things from memory\nand I get them backwards like that.\n\n495\n00:29:23.097 --> 00:29:26.210\nSo [LAUGH] set -o allexport.\n\n496\n00:29:26.210 --> 00:29:27.720\nThat's the command.\n\n497\n00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:29.090\nSo, that's a cool one.\n\n498\n00:29:29.090 --> 00:29:32.387\nIf your Linux distribution defaults to\nthat, then you don't need to do it,\n\n499\n00:29:32.387 --> 00:29:33.116\nand it's fine.\n\n500\n00:29:33.116 --> 00:29:33.799\nDon't worry about it.\n\n501\n00:29:33.799 --> 00:29:38.064\nBut if yours doesn't default to it,\nyou can put this in your profile or\n\n502\n00:29:38.064 --> 00:29:43.219\nyour bashrc or whatever so that every time\nyou boot up, it flips that little switch.\n\n503\n00:29:43.219 --> 00:29:45.720\nAnd it just says, hey, every variable\nI create, go ahead and export it.\n\n504\n00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:46.980\nMake it global, right?\n\n505\n00:29:46.980 --> 00:29:53.480\nThe ones that are defined in /etc/profile\nand /etc/bashrc, those are system wide.\n\n506\n00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:54.610\nThey're global already.\n\n507\n00:29:54.610 --> 00:29:58.616\nAll right, it's the ones that are defined\nin your home directory in .bashrc and\n\n508\n00:29:58.616 --> 00:30:02.560\n.bash_profile and .profile, those guys.\n\n509\n00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:06.920\nThose are the ones that typically\nend up being local variables,\n\n510\n00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:11.053\nthat are tied to your own\nparticular instance of that shell.\n\n511\n00:30:11.053 --> 00:30:13.120\nAll right, so just be aware of that.\n\n512\n00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:17.120\nA little bit of weird\nvariable handling there.\n\n513\n00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:18.980\nOther things,\nI know we're running a little low on time.\n\n514\n00:30:18.980 --> 00:30:20.510\nBut just a few last things.\n\n515\n00:30:20.510 --> 00:30:25.030\nThe alias command, you can also\nunalias a command to remove it.\n\n516\n00:30:25.030 --> 00:30:29.590\nSo I've got an alias in there right now\nfor ls and we'll let's take that ll one.\n\n517\n00:30:29.590 --> 00:30:34.460\nSo there's an ll one for\nls -l with coloring, right?\n\n518\n00:30:34.460 --> 00:30:36.490\nAnd maybe I really don't\nlike that being there.\n\n519\n00:30:36.490 --> 00:30:41.050\nI can say, unalias ll and\nwhen I remove that,\n\n520\n00:30:41.050 --> 00:30:44.810\nif I look at my alias list,\nI'll see that ll is gone.\n\n521\n00:30:44.810 --> 00:30:46.750\nAnd if I run it, it does nothing.\n\n522\n00:30:46.750 --> 00:30:48.780\nOkay, now if I log out and\n\n523\n00:30:48.780 --> 00:30:52.500\nlog back in, that alias is gonna\nbe right back again, okay?\n\n524\n00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:56.910\nAnd that's because it was defined\nin my profile and it's still there.\n\n525\n00:30:56.910 --> 00:31:00.140\nSo, I really just unaliased it for\nthis session.\n\n526\n00:31:00.140 --> 00:31:04.478\nUnalias is really more of a temporary\nthing, right, removing temporary aliases.\n\n527\n00:31:04.478 --> 00:31:07.500\nIf you wanna remove the ones that\nare already there, you gotta go and\n\n528\n00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:10.191\nedit those files, and you know,\nedit your startup files.\n\n529\n00:31:10.191 --> 00:31:12.700\nSo, all right.\n\n530\n00:31:12.700 --> 00:31:15.140\nThe next thing I wanna talk about\nare functions which are super cool,\n\n531\n00:31:15.140 --> 00:31:17.580\nI definitely need a good amount of\ntime to talk about them though.\n\n532\n00:31:17.580 --> 00:31:21.690\nSo let's do this, let's stop here and\ntake a break and when we get back, we're\n\n533\n00:31:21.690 --> 00:31:24.830\ngonna take a look at functions and get\na chance to see some really neat stuff.\n\n534\n00:31:24.830 --> 00:31:27.548\nI'll show you guys\na function that I use very,\n\n535\n00:31:27.548 --> 00:31:31.044\nvery frequently and\ngive you kind a taste of how that works.\n\n536\n00:31:31.044 --> 00:31:33.538\nSo stay tuned, we'll be back after this.\n\n537\n00:31:33.538 --> 00:31:41.167\n[MUSIC]\n\n538\n00:31:41.167 --> 00:31:43.020\nAll right, welcome back everybody.\n\n539\n00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:46.500\nNow, we talked about aliases,\nand aliases are cool, right?\n\n540\n00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:51.070\nYou can create a short name for\nsome long command if you want.\n\n541\n00:31:51.070 --> 00:31:53.337\nIf there's some long\ncommand that you run a lot,\n\n542\n00:31:53.337 --> 00:31:56.342\nyou can create an alias to abbreviate it,\nlife is good, right?\n\n543\n00:31:56.342 --> 00:31:57.995\nSo that's cool.\n\n544\n00:31:57.995 --> 00:32:04.116\nBut one thing an alias can't do very well\nis execute more than one command, right?\n\n545\n00:32:04.116 --> 00:32:07.779\nThere are times where we find\nourselves doing repetitious tasks.\n\n546\n00:32:07.779 --> 00:32:10.383\nThings that we do over and\nover and over again.\n\n547\n00:32:10.383 --> 00:32:12.320\nAnd wouldn't it be nice\nto kind of automate that?\n\n548\n00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:17.105\nWell, in the Bash CLI, we actually\nhave what are called functions,\n\n549\n00:32:17.105 --> 00:32:20.750\nand a function is basically\na group of commands.\n\n550\n00:32:20.750 --> 00:32:25.260\nWe can create a function that in\nturn calls a series of commands\n\n551\n00:32:25.260 --> 00:32:28.600\nperforming some action for us,\nand I use these all the time.\n\n552\n00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:33.490\nIf we have a series of commands we always\nrun together, you can run them manually.\n\n553\n00:32:33.490 --> 00:32:36.930\nYou just have to remember them,\nor you create that function, and\n\n554\n00:32:36.930 --> 00:32:38.400\nnow you can quickly call the function and\n\n555\n00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:42.790\nit will execute the sequence\nof commands as you desire it.\n\n556\n00:32:42.790 --> 00:32:46.780\nPretty neat functionality, pretty neat\nstuff, and it can be pretty useful.\n\n557\n00:32:46.780 --> 00:32:48.009\nI want to show you guys one that I use.\n\n558\n00:32:49.420 --> 00:32:51.770\nThere are times when I\nsit down on a machine and\n\n559\n00:32:51.770 --> 00:32:55.880\nI want to get some basic information\nabout its current performance or\n\n560\n00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:58.190\njust basic information\nabout the system itself.\n\n561\n00:32:58.190 --> 00:33:02.220\nI mentioned I've worked on a lot of\nmachines, so it might have been a month or\n\n562\n00:33:02.220 --> 00:33:04.280\ntwo since I've logged into\na particular machine, and\n\n563\n00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:07.570\nI just want to refresh my memory\nof what that machine is like.\n\n564\n00:33:07.570 --> 00:33:12.040\nI know I can run various commands to\nget that information together, but\n\n565\n00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:16.230\nif I can create a function, I can just\nhave a real quick one-stop shop, and\n\n566\n00:33:16.230 --> 00:33:18.260\npull up my system information, all right?\n\n567\n00:33:18.260 --> 00:33:19.920\nSo, let me show you how these work.\n\n568\n00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:25.044\nA function, we typically define it\neither in bashrc globally in /e\n\n569\n00:33:25.044 --> 00:33:29.990\nETC/SRC, or\nin the .src file in our own profile.\n\n570\n00:33:29.990 --> 00:33:34.110\nIf it's just gonna be for us,\nI'll create one just for me, so\n\n571\n00:33:34.110 --> 00:33:40.140\nmy home profile here and\nI'm gonna add it ./rc.\n\n572\n00:33:40.140 --> 00:33:42.150\nAll right, so\nhere I can see those aliases.\n\n573\n00:33:42.150 --> 00:33:44.940\nThis is the same place where\nI overrode that alias, and\n\n574\n00:33:44.940 --> 00:33:49.630\nnotice how it says right here user\nspecific aliases and functions.\n\n575\n00:33:49.630 --> 00:33:54.060\nSo, here's those aliases and\nI'm just gonna add another function.\n\n576\n00:33:54.060 --> 00:33:58.020\nI'm gonna add my function right in\nhere in the middle of this, okay?\n\n577\n00:33:58.020 --> 00:34:01.220\nSo, I'm gonna punch in my information and\ntell it what I want to do, and\n\n578\n00:34:01.220 --> 00:34:04.860\nwhat I want is, I want to create\na function that runs a series of\n\n579\n00:34:04.860 --> 00:34:08.500\ncommands that gives me information\nabout the computer that I'm on.\n\n580\n00:34:08.500 --> 00:34:12.590\nJust a quick summary of the information\nabout my system, all right?\n\n581\n00:34:12.590 --> 00:34:16.430\nAnd so, I'm gonna use some basic,\nthis will be our first kind of dabble into\n\n582\n00:34:16.430 --> 00:34:19.240\nscripting right here,\nwriting this function.\n\n583\n00:34:19.240 --> 00:34:20.530\nWe start off by giving it a name,\n\n584\n00:34:20.530 --> 00:34:26.170\nI'm gonna say function and\nI'm gonna call mine sysinfo, all right?\n\n585\n00:34:26.170 --> 00:34:29.770\nNow, when we give the function a name,\nthat's like the command that we're gonna\n\n586\n00:34:29.770 --> 00:34:33.070\nrun, so I'm effectively creating\na command called sysinfo.\n\n587\n00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:40.190\nWhenever I run that, it's then going\nto perform a series of actions, okay?\n\n588\n00:34:40.190 --> 00:34:44.080\nActions that I'm going to\ndefine right here, okay?\n\n589\n00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:44.970\nSo, now I'm going to go through and\n\n590\n00:34:44.970 --> 00:34:49.080\nstart to punch in all of these different\nactions and what I want it to do.\n\n591\n00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:51.750\nNow you can be very,\nvery complex with these, or\n\n592\n00:34:51.750 --> 00:34:53.580\nyou can be very simple and basic.\n\n593\n00:34:53.580 --> 00:34:55.530\nYou can use variables\nto pull on information,\n\n594\n00:34:55.530 --> 00:34:57.030\nyou can do all sorts of crazy stuff.\n\n595\n00:34:57.030 --> 00:34:59.350\nNow, I don't wanna go too crazy here.\n\n596\n00:34:59.350 --> 00:35:03.260\nFunctions, they really rely on\nbase functionality in the system.\n\n597\n00:35:03.260 --> 00:35:05.210\nI don't wanna go too crazy,\n\n598\n00:35:05.210 --> 00:35:07.650\nI especially don't wanna create\na whole lot of interaction just yet.\n\n599\n00:35:08.780 --> 00:35:10.530\nWe're going to get into scripting\nin the next segment and\n\n600\n00:35:10.530 --> 00:35:12.770\nI'll show you how to do interactions and\n\n601\n00:35:12.770 --> 00:35:14.740\nreally come up with some\nneat stuff there too.\n\n602\n00:35:14.740 --> 00:35:17.140\nBut for\nthis one if I just want to get in here and\n\n603\n00:35:17.140 --> 00:35:20.940\ncreate this big basic set of statements,\nI'm going to do a few things,\n\n604\n00:35:20.940 --> 00:35:24.080\nfirst off I want to add\na little text to the screen, so\n\n605\n00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:27.890\nI know what it is I'm looking at when\nthis data starts coming out at me.\n\n606\n00:35:27.890 --> 00:35:30.290\nSo I'm gonna use the echo command.\n\n607\n00:35:30.290 --> 00:35:36.300\nNow, the echo command when we run it,\nnormally echoes some text and then moves\n\n608\n00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:41.280\nto the next line and I need it to echo\nsome text and not mess with the lines.\n\n609\n00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:43.060\nI'll let the commands do that.\n\n610\n00:35:43.060 --> 00:35:46.370\nAnd so\nI'm gonna use the echo -e to do that.\n\n611\n00:35:46.370 --> 00:35:50.410\nAnd then I'm gonna specify that when\nthese commands run that they're showing\n\n612\n00:35:50.410 --> 00:35:53.380\non a new line on their own, and\nthen the command starts to follow.\n\n613\n00:35:53.380 --> 00:35:58.410\nSo, \\n is the expression\nthat means new line.\n\n614\n00:35:58.410 --> 00:36:02.360\nAnd so, I'll get a nice clean line,\nit's gonna output this text, and\n\n615\n00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:06.430\nthen this command is gonna run and\nshow the data after that, all right?\n\n616\n00:36:06.430 --> 00:36:10.240\nSo, I'm gonna say,\nI'll start with Kernel Information.\n\n617\n00:36:14.002 --> 00:36:18.920\nAnd that's what's gonna be displayed,\nand then I'm gonna turn around,\n\n618\n00:36:18.920 --> 00:36:20.965\nand have it execute uname -a.\n\n619\n00:36:20.965 --> 00:36:27.960\nRemember uname -a, that shows me\nthe version of my Linux kernel.\n\n620\n00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:31.190\nSo this line right here is going\nto basically echo a little text.\n\n621\n00:36:31.190 --> 00:36:37.670\nIt'll say kernel information, and\nthen it will give me the uname output.\n\n622\n00:36:37.670 --> 00:36:40.110\nAnd now I can follow it up with\nany other commands that I want.\n\n623\n00:36:40.110 --> 00:36:44.620\nIf I just do one command, I could of just\nrun uname -a, but I'm gonna add in some of\n\n624\n00:36:44.620 --> 00:36:48.090\nthe other, Other ones to give me that\nbasic information about my system.\n\n625\n00:36:48.090 --> 00:36:53.660\nSo I'm gonna continue this same\npattern of giving it a name and\n\n626\n00:36:53.660 --> 00:36:55.610\nthen running a command to get the output.\n\n627\n00:36:55.610 --> 00:36:59.550\nSo maybe with the next one,\nI wanna know the OS Version, right?\n\n628\n00:36:59.550 --> 00:37:02.820\nAnd this one a little bit\ntrickier because remember\n\n629\n00:37:02.820 --> 00:37:05.440\ndistributions report their\nversion differently.\n\n630\n00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:10.688\nSo I'm running CentOS if I wanna get\nthat one I just can do a cat slash\n\n631\n00:37:10.688 --> 00:37:17.920\netc/centos-release, and that's probably\nget what version of centos I'm running.\n\n632\n00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:22.080\nAnd I'll just continue adding more\ninformation, what else is good?\n\n633\n00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:30.280\nSystem Uptime :\" : uptime which we\ncan just run the uptime command for.\n\n634\n00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:35.836\nWhat else, memory utilization.\n\n635\n00:37:40.835 --> 00:37:44.020\nAnd I'll just do free-m.\n\n636\n00:37:44.020 --> 00:37:47.390\nSo free is showing me the memory\nthat's in use in the system and\n\n637\n00:37:47.390 --> 00:37:50.260\nthen -m to show it in megabytes\ninstead of kilobytes.\n\n638\n00:37:50.260 --> 00:37:54.970\nSo I don't have to do any conversions in\nmy head cuz I am terrible at those And\n\n639\n00:37:54.970 --> 00:38:01.170\nthen lastly we'll do\nFilesystem Utilization\n\n640\n00:38:03.860 --> 00:38:05.986\nand we'll use df -h,\n\n641\n00:38:05.986 --> 00:38:11.670\ndf -h shows us our disk space that is free\nand puts it in a human readable format.\n\n642\n00:38:11.670 --> 00:38:15.890\nSo, it'll show gigs or megs or k or\nwhatever based on what's actually used.\n\n643\n00:38:17.830 --> 00:38:19.880\nAll right, that's probably enough,\nI'll go ahead and close that out.\n\n644\n00:38:21.380 --> 00:38:24.570\nAll right, so now what I've done\nis I've written a function.\n\n645\n00:38:24.570 --> 00:38:28.850\nIf I call sysinfo,\nwhen I run that sysinfo function,\n\n646\n00:38:28.850 --> 00:38:32.310\nit's gonna turn around and\nit's gonna run each of these commands.\n\n647\n00:38:32.310 --> 00:38:36.970\nIt's gonna run them in order, and that\noutput is gonna get exported to my screen.\n\n648\n00:38:36.970 --> 00:38:38.640\nI'm gonna see it on my screen so\n\n649\n00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:41.280\nI can see what's going on None\nof these are interactive.\n\n650\n00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:42.950\nWe'll see interactive stuff later on.\n\n651\n00:38:42.950 --> 00:38:46.840\nBut for right now, it's going to output\nthat data and I'll see it on my screen.\n\n652\n00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:51.070\nI don't have to run each of these commands\nindividually, it going to do it for me.\n\n653\n00:38:51.070 --> 00:38:53.270\nI'm going to go ahead and save this.\n\n654\n00:38:57.330 --> 00:39:00.290\nAnd now, it's there, and I can run it.\n\n655\n00:39:00.290 --> 00:39:05.850\nI can just run sysinfo, and it'll execute.\n\n656\n00:39:05.850 --> 00:39:09.130\nWell, it will execute the next\ntime dash RC is loaded.\n\n657\n00:39:09.130 --> 00:39:11.910\nbash RC is loaded when we logged in.\n\n658\n00:39:11.910 --> 00:39:13.070\nI'm already logged in.\n\n659\n00:39:13.070 --> 00:39:14.520\nSo, it's not gonna get loaded.\n\n660\n00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:17.690\nSo, all I need to do is log out and\nlog back in.\n\n661\n00:39:19.830 --> 00:39:23.970\nAnd now, assuming I didn't have\nany typos when I run sys info.\n\n662\n00:39:23.970 --> 00:39:25.020\nHere we go.\n\n663\n00:39:25.020 --> 00:39:27.600\nI see my Kernel information\nup there at the top.\n\n664\n00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:30.450\nSo, there's the text that\nI exported to the screen.\n\n665\n00:39:30.450 --> 00:39:34.650\nKernel information [INAUDIBLE] and\nrunning OS version, and\n\n666\n00:39:34.650 --> 00:39:37.920\nthere it pulled that I'm running\nCentOS release 6.5 Final.\n\n667\n00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:39.790\nSystem uptime, there it is.\n\n668\n00:39:39.790 --> 00:39:42.990\nMemory utilization,\nfilesystem utilization, right.\n\n669\n00:39:42.990 --> 00:39:47.430\nAll those commands output on one\nnice neat little screen right there.\n\n670\n00:39:47.430 --> 00:39:50.970\nAnd now I can quickly get backup\nthe speed on this machine.\n\n671\n00:39:50.970 --> 00:39:51.960\nYou can customize it further.\n\n672\n00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:54.413\nYou can add things like host name,\nIP address.\n\n673\n00:39:54.413 --> 00:39:58.556\nYou know, you can run ifconfig and\ngrep it for the actual, or use oc or\n\n674\n00:39:58.556 --> 00:40:03.271\nwhatever to grab just the IP address And\nthere's all sorts of stuff you can do to\n\n675\n00:40:03.271 --> 00:40:08.720\ncreate really creative screens that give\nyou that quick summary of your system.\n\n676\n00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:11.920\nSo really, really powerful.\n\n677\n00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:15.430\nAnd when you define this,\nnow if you've got 50 servers and\n\n678\n00:40:15.430 --> 00:40:18.640\nyou log into a server and\nyou can't remember how it's configured,\n\n679\n00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:22.600\nwell you log in and you say,\nall right well let me just sysinfo.\n\n680\n00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:24.320\nAnd you've effectively\ncreated your own command.\n\n681\n00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:26.270\nIt's really just a collection\nof other commands, but\n\n682\n00:40:26.270 --> 00:40:29.390\nit outputs the data that you want\nin the format that you want,\n\n683\n00:40:29.390 --> 00:40:32.715\nand ultimately make you more efficient,\nhopefully.\n\n684\n00:40:32.715 --> 00:40:37.110\n[LAUGH] Unless you spend hours upon\nhours creating the perfect function,\n\n685\n00:40:37.110 --> 00:40:39.210\nin which case it might have been\nfaster to run the individual commands.\n\n686\n00:40:39.210 --> 00:40:42.590\nThat happens to me sometimes but\nthat's all a function is.\n\n687\n00:40:42.590 --> 00:40:47.410\nWe're just taking a group of commands and\nputting them together, right.\n\n688\n00:40:47.410 --> 00:40:52.130\nAnd I defined that right\nhere in my bashrc, and so\n\n689\n00:40:52.130 --> 00:40:56.820\nthere's that function and just sitting\nright there and that's basically it.\n\n690\n00:40:56.820 --> 00:40:59.130\nAnd you could have put\nwhatever you wanted in there.\n\n691\n00:40:59.130 --> 00:41:02.090\nAnd I didn't have to do these echos,\nI could have just called the individual\n\n692\n00:41:02.090 --> 00:41:04.890\ncommands if I wanted it to\nperform some kind of an action,\n\n693\n00:41:04.890 --> 00:41:07.740\nwe don't necessarily need the echo, I just\nwanted to make it look nice and neat.\n\n694\n00:41:12.504 --> 00:41:16.250\nAll right, so that is a function.\n\n695\n00:41:16.250 --> 00:41:18.390\nThe last thing that I want to talk about,\n\n696\n00:41:18.390 --> 00:41:23.064\nin terms of the shell,\nI mentioned the .bash rc and\n\n697\n00:41:23.064 --> 00:41:28.770\n.bash_ profile that are right\nhere in my own user directory and\n\n698\n00:41:28.770 --> 00:41:34.550\nwe mentioned the global ones that\nare in /etc/profile/etc/bashrc.\n\n699\n00:41:34.550 --> 00:41:38.720\nThere's one other place we need to\nbe aware of inside of etc there\n\n700\n00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:44.630\nis a folder called skel,\nS-K-E-L, all right?\n\n701\n00:41:44.630 --> 00:41:50.320\nThat's short for skeleton, and\n/etc/skeleton, what it is,\n\n702\n00:41:50.320 --> 00:41:56.100\nis a collection of files that will be\nused for any new user that's created.\n\n703\n00:41:56.100 --> 00:41:58.690\nWhen you create a new user,\n\n704\n00:41:58.690 --> 00:42:03.360\nanything that's in skell will be copied\nto their home directory, all right?\n\n705\n00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:08.112\nSo if you wanna modify a user's .bashrc,\nor\n\n706\n00:42:08.112 --> 00:42:11.700\n.bash_logout all right?\n\n707\n00:42:11.700 --> 00:42:15.750\nAnd you wanted that to affect even\nnew users, but still allow them\n\n708\n00:42:15.750 --> 00:42:20.270\nto modify it or whatever, you would\nmake the changes here inside of Scout.\n\n709\n00:42:21.450 --> 00:42:23.220\nBy making the change here,\n\n710\n00:42:23.220 --> 00:42:27.690\nwhen you create new users that change\nwill be present there also, okay?\n\n711\n00:42:27.690 --> 00:42:31.724\nSo for example, if I edit the .bashrc\n\n712\n00:42:31.724 --> 00:42:35.800\nright here and\nwe can see user specific aliases.\n\n713\n00:42:35.800 --> 00:42:38.630\nThere aren't any and so\nI'm gonna add a new one.\n\n714\n00:42:38.630 --> 00:42:44.931\nSo I'll just say ls= ls -la\n\n715\n00:42:44.931 --> 00:42:51.510\n--color= Auto.\n\n716\n00:42:51.510 --> 00:42:52.140\nAll right.\n\n717\n00:42:52.140 --> 00:42:56.720\nSo, for my users, I want the ls\ncommand to default to the long form,\n\n718\n00:42:56.720 --> 00:43:00.080\nshowing all files or maybe I don't,\nmaybe I don't want all files.\n\n719\n00:43:00.080 --> 00:43:02.130\nThis is for my regular users, right.\n\n720\n00:43:02.130 --> 00:43:03.730\nI do want the long form.\n\n721\n00:43:03.730 --> 00:43:06.610\nBut, I'd want to color turned on, right?\n\n722\n00:43:06.610 --> 00:43:08.670\nSo that's what I want\ntheir ls to default to so\n\n723\n00:43:08.670 --> 00:43:13.035\nI'm gonna put that in bashrc and\nthere we go.\n\n724\n00:43:13.035 --> 00:43:14.370\nOkay.\nSo I put that in there,\n\n725\n00:43:14.370 --> 00:43:15.850\nthat's my manual overwrite.\n\n726\n00:43:15.850 --> 00:43:19.070\nI could have put a note on this that I\ndid it In fact let me do that just so\n\n727\n00:43:19.070 --> 00:43:22.275\nwe can make sure that it actually\nis my changes that's taking effect.\n\n728\n00:43:22.275 --> 00:43:29.760\nSo entered by Don, okay.\n\n729\n00:43:29.760 --> 00:43:35.000\nSo now if I create a new user, and I know\nwe haven't covered that command yet,\n\n730\n00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:39.700\nbut I'm gonna use the useradd command and\nI'll create a user called bsmith.\n\n731\n00:43:40.780 --> 00:43:42.660\nDid I already create a bsmith?\n\n732\n00:43:42.660 --> 00:43:46.050\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Shoot my a, okay so\n\n733\n00:43:46.050 --> 00:43:47.860\nI just created a user called bsmith.\n\n734\n00:43:47.860 --> 00:43:52.220\nLet me just set his password real\nquick just to be sure it's complete.\n\n735\n00:43:53.950 --> 00:43:57.240\nAll right, so now I've got a use\ncalled Bob Smith, all right?\n\n736\n00:43:57.240 --> 00:44:02.110\nIf I go into /home I can see that\nbsmith has his own directory.\n\n737\n00:44:02.110 --> 00:44:03.820\nI created Bob the other day,\nthat's what I did.\n\n738\n00:44:03.820 --> 00:44:08.470\nSo bsmith has a directory and\nif I change into B Smith's directory and\n\n739\n00:44:08.470 --> 00:44:12.460\nI do an LS dash LA,\nthere's those files that are present, and\n\n740\n00:44:12.460 --> 00:44:17.060\nif I do a more of his bash RC,\nthere it is.\n\n741\n00:44:17.060 --> 00:44:21.700\nEntered by Don, the alias of LS\ndash L dash dash color equals auto.\n\n742\n00:44:21.700 --> 00:44:28.860\nSo, that slash skeleton folder, slash e t\nt slash skel, is your default use profile.\n\n743\n00:44:28.860 --> 00:44:30.880\nWhen a new users created,\n\n744\n00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:34.990\nthat's what copied to create their\nhome folder their home directory.\n\n745\n00:44:34.990 --> 00:44:39.480\nIf a user already existed like Bob and\nTom, they already had directories.\n\n746\n00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:41.370\nDeep is that I already have a directory.\n\n747\n00:44:41.370 --> 00:44:43.410\nModification and\nskill don't affect them at all.\n\n748\n00:44:43.410 --> 00:44:45.260\nRight?\nSo, it doesn't go retroactive.\n\n749\n00:44:45.260 --> 00:44:47.040\nIt doesn't affect users\nthat already exist.\n\n750\n00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:51.290\nIt just affects any new user\ncreated from this point on, okay.\n\n751\n00:44:51.290 --> 00:44:55.620\nYou could put something in /etc/profile\nthat would affect everybody but\n\n752\n00:44:55.620 --> 00:45:00.190\nit might be that you just want\nto affect new users /etc/skel,\n\n753\n00:45:00.190 --> 00:45:04.130\nthe skeleton folder that's\nwhere you want it to go.\n\n754\n00:45:04.130 --> 00:45:08.940\nAll right,\nthat is really about it as far as Bash,\n\n755\n00:45:08.940 --> 00:45:13.810\nas far as customizing Bash itself,\ntweaking with the config files,\n\n756\n00:45:13.810 --> 00:45:17.000\nlogon scripts, functions,\naliases, it's all good stuff.\n\n757\n00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:20.930\nIt's all things that you may find that\nyou do out there in real life land.\n\n758\n00:45:21.990 --> 00:45:24.950\nLess and less people are actually\nmaking use of the shell.\n\n759\n00:45:24.950 --> 00:45:29.650\nSo, usually we don't have to\ncustomize it too much cuz as admins,\n\n760\n00:45:29.650 --> 00:45:33.620\nwe learn how it works the way that it is,\nso customization aren't necessary.\n\n761\n00:45:33.620 --> 00:45:36.330\nBut if you're in an environment where\nyour end-users need access to the shell,\n\n762\n00:45:36.330 --> 00:45:39.510\nyou may have to customize it pretty\nheavily to get it user-friendly enough\n\n763\n00:45:39.510 --> 00:45:40.220\nto work for them.\n\n764\n00:45:42.280 --> 00:45:45.680\nAll right,\nwell what is next on our agenda?\n\n765\n00:45:45.680 --> 00:45:47.950\nAnd scripts, right?\n\n766\n00:45:47.950 --> 00:45:52.470\nSo we took a look at writing\na function a minute ago, and\n\n767\n00:45:52.470 --> 00:45:54.400\na function is sort of like a script.\n\n768\n00:45:54.400 --> 00:46:00.520\nIt was one command that we called that\nthen performed a series of actions, okay?\n\n769\n00:46:00.520 --> 00:46:03.690\nNow I made a function, which was just\nsomething we could call whenever we\n\n770\n00:46:03.690 --> 00:46:06.060\nwanted that was a part of bash.\n\n771\n00:46:06.060 --> 00:46:06.740\nRight.\n\n772\n00:46:06.740 --> 00:46:11.870\nBut you can actually write script files\nthat are now separate from your shell\n\n773\n00:46:11.870 --> 00:46:14.280\nthat you can run or\nyou can send to somebody else,\n\n774\n00:46:14.280 --> 00:46:17.750\nthey can run you can assign\npermissions to and control.\n\n775\n00:46:17.750 --> 00:46:20.960\nIt's not a part of your profile anymore,\nit's actually just a script\n\n776\n00:46:20.960 --> 00:46:25.420\nthat's sitting there in a file on the hard\ndrive there's a lot of power with that,\n\n777\n00:46:25.420 --> 00:46:29.900\nyou can do a lot of crazy\nthings with a script file.\n\n778\n00:46:29.900 --> 00:46:31.600\nAnd what I find is that,\n\n779\n00:46:31.600 --> 00:46:36.530\nI take whatever repetitious tasks I have\nto perform, and I create scripts for them.\n\n780\n00:46:36.530 --> 00:46:39.700\nAnd the main reason I do it is\nbecause I'll usually combine that with\n\n781\n00:46:39.700 --> 00:46:40.910\nthe Cron job.\n\n782\n00:46:40.910 --> 00:46:46.310\nCron is a timer slash scheduler that\nruns in the background of Linux and\n\n783\n00:46:46.310 --> 00:46:48.830\nit lets you run things\nat particular times.\n\n784\n00:46:48.830 --> 00:46:52.640\nSo if I have backups, and I run ten\ndifferent commands to run my backups,\n\n785\n00:46:52.640 --> 00:46:56.670\nright, maybe I tar up a bunch of files,\nand I zip it up to compress it and\n\n786\n00:46:56.670 --> 00:46:58.560\nI move it to a certain location.\n\n787\n00:46:58.560 --> 00:47:01.880\nWell, I can write one script\nthat does all of that, and\n\n788\n00:47:01.880 --> 00:47:04.940\nthen I can use cron to schedule\nit to run every day at 3:00 AM.\n\n789\n00:47:04.940 --> 00:47:05.480\nRight.\n\n790\n00:47:05.480 --> 00:47:09.530\nSo having a script file define that\ndoes this stuff for us is really handy.\n\n791\n00:47:09.530 --> 00:47:10.690\nIt can also be useful for\n\n792\n00:47:10.690 --> 00:47:15.200\nother things like,\nI created that user a second ago, right.\n\n793\n00:47:15.200 --> 00:47:18.780\nSo I wanted to create a user named Bob,\nand I had to do a few things, right.\n\n794\n00:47:18.780 --> 00:47:24.810\nI had to run useradd and specify his name\nand then I had to do, what else did I do.\n\n795\n00:47:24.810 --> 00:47:25.960\nAssign his password, right.\n\n796\n00:47:25.960 --> 00:47:29.070\nThat was a completely separate\ncommand passwd right.\n\n797\n00:47:29.070 --> 00:47:31.550\nI might want to create a script file\n\n798\n00:47:31.550 --> 00:47:36.150\nthat lets me provide all those values at\nonce and then it just runs it for me.\n\n799\n00:47:36.150 --> 00:47:38.040\nSo I don't have to remember\nthe different commands.\n\n800\n00:47:38.040 --> 00:47:41.800\nI don't have to remember the command\nswitches it will just do it for me and\n\n801\n00:47:41.800 --> 00:47:42.930\nknock it right out.\n\n802\n00:47:42.930 --> 00:47:43.480\nOkay.\n\n803\n00:47:43.480 --> 00:47:44.080\nSo we can do that.\n\n804\n00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:46.181\nWe can create a script that\nmade that a lot easier for us.\n\n805\n00:47:46.181 --> 00:47:49.485\nNow, if you're just creating a script\nto run a sequence of commands,\n\n806\n00:47:49.485 --> 00:47:53.688\nit's really just like that function we saw\na minute ago, there's not much difference.\n\n807\n00:47:53.688 --> 00:47:56.955\nBut the most powerful\nscripts We'll take input,\n\n808\n00:47:56.955 --> 00:48:02.130\nwhat allows to provide values to\nthe script to perform an action.\n\n809\n00:48:02.130 --> 00:48:05.800\nSo what I wanna do is\nkinda create two examples.\n\n810\n00:48:05.800 --> 00:48:07.590\nI'll do a real simple script first and\n\n811\n00:48:07.590 --> 00:48:10.700\nthen we'll create a more complex one\nthat shows some advance functionality.\n\n812\n00:48:11.910 --> 00:48:16.210\nSo first thing I wanna do is I'm gonna\nget back to my home directory, and\n\n813\n00:48:16.210 --> 00:48:21.180\nI'm gonna create just a very very\nbasic script file, all right.\n\n814\n00:48:21.180 --> 00:48:25.950\nNow script files typically have\nan extension that ends in .sh they don't\n\n815\n00:48:25.950 --> 00:48:28.630\nhave to that's normally what we\ndo .sh just stands for shell.\n\n816\n00:48:28.630 --> 00:48:30.310\nIt's a shell script.\n\n817\n00:48:30.310 --> 00:48:35.432\nSo I'm gonna create example.sh.\n\n818\n00:48:35.432 --> 00:48:40.820\nAll right, now scripts need to be\nexecutable we're going to run them.\n\n819\n00:48:40.820 --> 00:48:44.290\nSo we do need to pay attention\nto the permissions on\n\n820\n00:48:44.290 --> 00:48:46.960\nthat file that we just created.\n\n821\n00:48:46.960 --> 00:48:51.860\nSo if I look at example.sh, I can see\nthe permissions are read and write for\n\n822\n00:48:51.860 --> 00:48:55.940\nthe owner read for the group,\nread for everyone else.\n\n823\n00:48:55.940 --> 00:48:58.850\nNobody has execute permissions.\n\n824\n00:48:58.850 --> 00:49:02.230\nSo if I want somebody to be able to\nrun my script, I'm gonna need to\n\n825\n00:49:02.230 --> 00:49:07.570\ngive them the execute permission, and we,\nwe saw that in the permissions episode.\n\n826\n00:49:07.570 --> 00:49:09.200\nThere's a few different\nways that I can do it,\n\n827\n00:49:09.200 --> 00:49:12.430\nthey all revolve around\nthe 'change mod' command.\n\n828\n00:49:12.430 --> 00:49:16.820\nI could say chmod 755 example.sh, right,\n\n829\n00:49:16.820 --> 00:49:21.340\nand that would give me as the owner read,\nwrite, and\n\n830\n00:49:21.340 --> 00:49:24.500\nexecute and it would give\neverybody else read and execute.\n\n831\n00:49:24.500 --> 00:49:28.540\nSo everybody else would basically\nbe gaining the execute bit,\n\n832\n00:49:28.540 --> 00:49:30.670\nthat's one way to go about it.\n\n833\n00:49:30.670 --> 00:49:39.570\nI could also say u+x example.sh,\nremembering that u means the user,\n\n834\n00:49:39.570 --> 00:49:44.930\nme, whoever the creator is or\nI could do g+x to give the group execute.\n\n835\n00:49:44.930 --> 00:49:50.500\nOr I could do o+x to give others,\neverybody else, the execute bit.\n\n836\n00:49:50.500 --> 00:49:53.100\nThere's also one that I don't think\nI covered in the show the other day,\n\n837\n00:49:53.100 --> 00:49:56.340\nwhich is if you just leave that\nletter off If you say plus x,\n\n838\n00:49:56.340 --> 00:49:58.730\nthat will give everybody execute.\n\n839\n00:49:58.730 --> 00:50:02.790\nSo, right now it's read write for me,\nready for everybody else, that would\n\n840\n00:50:02.790 --> 00:50:06.570\nchange you to read write execute for me,\nand read and execute for everybody else.\n\n841\n00:50:06.570 --> 00:50:10.000\nI'm gonna do that right there, all right.\n\n842\n00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:13.890\nAnd if I take a look at that file now,\nsee how it just add and\n\n843\n00:50:13.890 --> 00:50:18.830\nthen execute it, so that's an easy way to\nquickly add execution to a script file.\n\n844\n00:50:26.116 --> 00:50:30.596\nAll right, so now, my script is Is\ncreated, and it's set to execute, but\n\n845\n00:50:30.596 --> 00:50:33.960\nit's kind of empty, so\nit's not gonna do us much good.\n\n846\n00:50:33.960 --> 00:50:35.850\nSo we need to actually put\nsome stuff in there, so\n\n847\n00:50:35.850 --> 00:50:40.240\nI'm gonna edit it, and\nwe'll put some stuff in there.\n\n848\n00:50:40.240 --> 00:50:43.250\nNow when you write a shell\nscript your first line is\n\n849\n00:50:43.250 --> 00:50:45.560\nalways going to be the same thing.\n\n850\n00:50:45.560 --> 00:50:49.530\nWe need to tell Linux,\nthat this is a shell script, and\n\n851\n00:50:49.530 --> 00:50:52.110\nif it's not already in a shell,\nthen it needs to create one,\n\n852\n00:50:52.110 --> 00:50:55.920\nit needs to fire up a shell to run\nthis in, if there isn't one already.\n\n853\n00:50:55.920 --> 00:50:57.620\nLike if we're running this\ninside of X Windows or\n\n854\n00:50:57.620 --> 00:51:00.290\nwhatever, then it'll\nneed the node to do that.\n\n855\n00:51:00.290 --> 00:51:03.929\nSo your first line is\nalways going to be #.\n\n856\n00:51:03.929 --> 00:51:07.460\nNow # technically means\ndon't run this line.\n\n857\n00:51:07.460 --> 00:51:11.860\nAny time you see a hash mark or\na # at the beginning of a line, that means\n\n858\n00:51:11.860 --> 00:51:15.288\nignore whatever I'm about to type,\nbut this first line is kinda special.\n\n859\n00:51:15.288 --> 00:51:16.706\nWe say #!\n\n860\n00:51:16.706 --> 00:51:20.670\nand then it is /bin/bash.\n\n861\n00:51:20.670 --> 00:51:26.640\nAnd what that's doing is it's telling\nthe system, hey this is a script.\n\n862\n00:51:26.640 --> 00:51:28.320\nI should be run from a shell.\n\n863\n00:51:28.320 --> 00:51:31.600\nIf you're not in a shell already,\nthen run one.\n\n864\n00:51:31.600 --> 00:51:35.616\nCreate one, /bin/bash that's\nwhat this should be run from.\n\n865\n00:51:36.960 --> 00:51:41.070\nThen, we follow that up with\nwhatever we wanna do, okay?\n\n866\n00:51:41.070 --> 00:51:43.270\nAnd what we do might be\nsomething very simple.\n\n867\n00:51:43.270 --> 00:51:47.220\nI might create a variable.\n\n868\n00:51:48.310 --> 00:51:53.870\nI'll call it MESG for message and\nI can set that to, this is my message.\n\n869\n00:51:53.870 --> 00:51:58.890\nAll right, so\nnow I've created a variable and\n\n870\n00:51:58.890 --> 00:52:02.770\nI stuck something in it and\nthen I can echo that out.\n\n871\n00:52:02.770 --> 00:52:06.970\nI can say echo, if I spell it right,\n\n872\n00:52:06.970 --> 00:52:11.380\nit will work better $MESG, all right?\n\n873\n00:52:11.380 --> 00:52:14.690\nDollar sign means get this stuff\nfrom that variable, right?\n\n874\n00:52:14.690 --> 00:52:20.920\nSo find a variable called MESG and\nshow me whatever was in there, right?\n\n875\n00:52:20.920 --> 00:52:23.520\nThis is a really simple script,\nI'm not trying to do anything crazy and\n\n876\n00:52:23.520 --> 00:52:24.820\ncomplex here,\njust trying to keep it simple.\n\n877\n00:52:24.820 --> 00:52:28.880\nWe've got a variable, I want you to\ndisplay it on the screen, all right?\n\n878\n00:52:28.880 --> 00:52:30.450\nSo, I'm gonna go ahead and save that.\n\n879\n00:52:33.199 --> 00:52:35.330\nAnd then I'm going to run the script.\n\n880\n00:52:35.330 --> 00:52:39.630\nNow executables are weird\nwhen you run an executable\n\n881\n00:52:39.630 --> 00:52:42.940\nit's going to look in the path to find it.\n\n882\n00:52:42.940 --> 00:52:45.230\nWell, my home directory\nis not in the path.\n\n883\n00:52:45.230 --> 00:52:50.740\nSo, if I just run example.sh I\nget command not found, okay?\n\n884\n00:52:50.740 --> 00:52:52.680\nI've got two choices here.\n\n885\n00:52:52.680 --> 00:52:56.430\nOne, I can add my home directory to\nthe path which i don't want to do, or,\n\n886\n00:52:56.430 --> 00:53:00.200\ntwo I can run the The executable and\n\n887\n00:53:00.200 --> 00:53:03.886\nspecify the relative path to it,\nor the full path to it.\n\n888\n00:53:03.886 --> 00:53:09.310\nI can say ./example.sh, which means\nlook at my current directory for\n\n889\n00:53:09.310 --> 00:53:16.070\na file called example.sh and run it and\nthen there we go, this is my message.\n\n890\n00:53:16.070 --> 00:53:20.980\nOr I could a full path,\nright I'm in /root/example.sh,\n\n891\n00:53:20.980 --> 00:53:24.140\nand when I run that this is my message,\nsame thing,\n\n892\n00:53:24.140 --> 00:53:29.530\njust a relative path versus\na fully qualified path.\n\n893\n00:53:29.530 --> 00:53:33.640\nNow you start to get an idea of why, as\nyou've watched me type these commands over\n\n894\n00:53:33.640 --> 00:53:36.320\nthe last week or\nhowever long we've been going now,\n\n895\n00:53:36.320 --> 00:53:39.430\nI almost always put dot\nslash before file names.\n\n896\n00:53:39.430 --> 00:53:45.480\nI always specify that path and it's\nbecause I don't trust the path variables\n\n897\n00:53:45.480 --> 00:53:49.820\njust because when you bounce between\nsystems, things are every changing, right?\n\n898\n00:53:49.820 --> 00:53:53.240\nThere's differences between one distro and\nanother distro so I've just,\n\n899\n00:53:53.240 --> 00:53:57.830\nout of habit, gotten to where I always\nspecify the relative path to that file so\n\n900\n00:53:57.830 --> 00:54:00.080\nthat I know I am working\nwith the right file.\n\n901\n00:54:00.080 --> 00:54:03.835\nI never want to have an instance where\nI think I'm running a program or\n\n902\n00:54:03.835 --> 00:54:07.075\nscript from my directory but\nin reality, I'm running a program or\n\n903\n00:54:07.075 --> 00:54:10.565\nscript that's somewhere else that happens\nto be in the path and mine isn't.\n\n904\n00:54:10.565 --> 00:54:14.555\nRight, that's a real risk and you can be\nrunning something that you don't expect.\n\n905\n00:54:14.555 --> 00:54:17.070\nSo out of habit I always\nput that in there and\n\n906\n00:54:17.070 --> 00:54:20.050\nyou've probably seen me do\nthat throughout the show.\n\n907\n00:54:20.050 --> 00:54:22.660\nMost of the time when I do it,\nit's not necessary but\n\n908\n00:54:22.660 --> 00:54:24.230\nI'm a better safe than sorry guy.\n\n909\n00:54:24.230 --> 00:54:27.560\nYou know when you're working on\nsystems that need to stay online you\n\n910\n00:54:27.560 --> 00:54:28.660\ndon't wanna make a mistake.\n\n911\n00:54:28.660 --> 00:54:31.220\nSo I've kind of gotten in that habit.\n\n912\n00:54:31.220 --> 00:54:33.830\nSo I don't normally add it to\nthe path I just call it directly so\n\n913\n00:54:33.830 --> 00:54:37.680\nI can say ./example.sh and it runs.\n\n914\n00:54:37.680 --> 00:54:42.190\nIt creates the variable and\nthen it displays the message,\n\n915\n00:54:42.190 --> 00:54:44.210\nechos out that variable on my screen.\n\n916\n00:54:44.210 --> 00:54:47.740\nVery simple script right here, but\nit gives you an idea that from\n\n917\n00:54:47.740 --> 00:54:50.730\nhere we can just start adding\nmore commands to that script and\n\n918\n00:54:50.730 --> 00:54:52.860\nwe can get things to be\nreally really powerful.\n\n919\n00:54:54.110 --> 00:55:00.220\nSo what I wanna do is I wanna\nup this a little bit and create\n\n920\n00:55:00.220 --> 00:55:05.960\na more enhanced type of script, something\nthat does something a little better.\n\n921\n00:55:05.960 --> 00:55:09.230\nI wanna create a new user's Script, right?\n\n922\n00:55:09.230 --> 00:55:12.960\nA script that performs some\nactions to get ready to,\n\n923\n00:55:12.960 --> 00:55:18.490\nto create a new user account instead of\nusing user ad and passwd and chgroup and\n\n924\n00:55:18.490 --> 00:55:23.630\nall those other CH group add and\nall those other ones.\n\n925\n00:55:23.630 --> 00:55:26.840\nAnd study in that stuff will create\na script that does it for us.\n\n926\n00:55:26.840 --> 00:55:28.000\nRight?\nIt takes care of\n\n927\n00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:29.010\ncreating our user accounts.\n\n928\n00:55:29.010 --> 00:55:32.200\nSo, it'll be fun but we don't really\nhave enough time in this segments.\n\n929\n00:55:32.200 --> 00:55:33.000\nSo, let's do this.\n\n930\n00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:37.453\nLet's stop and take a break and when we\nget back, we'll see a better example of\n\n931\n00:55:37.453 --> 00:55:40.240\ndoing scripting and\nsome stuff we can do for you.\n\n932\n00:55:40.240 --> 00:55:42.459\nSo, stay tuned, we'll be back in a few.\n\n933\n00:55:42.459 --> 00:55:49.949\n[MUSIC]\n\n934\n00:55:49.949 --> 00:55:51.537\nAll right welcome back everybody.\n\n935\n00:55:51.537 --> 00:55:56.120\nSo what we're going to do now is take\na look at a slightly more complex script.\n\n936\n00:55:56.120 --> 00:55:59.410\nOne that not just takes in user input, but\n\n937\n00:55:59.410 --> 00:56:03.270\nalso makes decisions based on\nthe input that we feed it.\n\n938\n00:56:03.270 --> 00:56:06.620\nAnd that's a pretty common thing because,\nsadly,\n\n939\n00:56:06.620 --> 00:56:10.840\nit's very rare that you get\na one-command-fits-all type environment.\n\n940\n00:56:10.840 --> 00:56:14.690\nWe normally have to run variations\nbased on certain scenarios.\n\n941\n00:56:14.690 --> 00:56:17.330\nLet's use my example of\ncreating new user accounts.\n\n942\n00:56:17.330 --> 00:56:20.030\nI know I'm going to create\nsome user accounts and\n\n943\n00:56:20.030 --> 00:56:22.930\nI kind of want to make that system\na little more straightforward for\n\n944\n00:56:22.930 --> 00:56:25.080\nme or maybe I'm delegating\nthis to somebody else.\n\n945\n00:56:25.080 --> 00:56:27.090\nAnd I want it to be easier for them.\n\n946\n00:56:27.090 --> 00:56:33.420\nSo I'm gonna create a script\nwhich I'll just call newuser.sh.\n\n947\n00:56:33.420 --> 00:56:39.490\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead and\nadd the execute bit to it so\n\n948\n00:56:39.490 --> 00:56:45.150\nthat So that, well we'll be able to run\nit cuz that's kind of helpful, all right.\n\n949\n00:56:46.920 --> 00:56:52.350\nThen I'm just gonna edit that and now\nwe'll start to have some fun, all right.\n\n950\n00:56:52.350 --> 00:56:53.540\nNow like I mentioned earlier,\n\n951\n00:56:53.540 --> 00:56:56.420\nscripts are pretty much always\ngonna start out the same way,\n\n952\n00:56:56.420 --> 00:57:02.430\nby specifying that they are a script and\nthat they need a command shell.\n\n953\n00:57:02.430 --> 00:57:04.390\nOkay, so I'll go ahead and\nthrow that in there.\n\n954\n00:57:04.390 --> 00:57:08.290\nAnd now I need to start throwing in what I\nactually want to do, the work that I want.\n\n955\n00:57:08.290 --> 00:57:13.320\nNow, it is a good idea to comment\nyour code, when you write scripts\n\n956\n00:57:13.320 --> 00:57:16.610\nlike these you can put little notes\nthroughout it, to say what you're doing.\n\n957\n00:57:16.610 --> 00:57:21.140\nSo, right here at the beginning\nyou might put in this is a script\n\n958\n00:57:21.140 --> 00:57:25.340\nto assist with new user creation.\n\n959\n00:57:26.570 --> 00:57:27.200\nAll right.\n\n960\n00:57:27.200 --> 00:57:29.950\nAny time you want to put\na note you just put a little\n\n961\n00:57:29.950 --> 00:57:33.590\npound symbol at the beginning of\nthat line and you can do anything.\n\n962\n00:57:33.590 --> 00:57:36.720\nNormally I'd hit control a to jump\nto the beginning of that line.\n\n963\n00:57:36.720 --> 00:57:39.790\nWell let see is VMware\nmessing with me still?\n\n964\n00:57:39.790 --> 00:57:41.910\nAll right, well.\n\n965\n00:57:41.910 --> 00:57:44.620\nAnyhow, so [LAUGH] there we go.\n\n966\n00:57:44.620 --> 00:57:47.230\nWe can punch that in and\n\n967\n00:57:47.230 --> 00:57:50.970\nnow I've got a little note just to remind\nme if I ever edit this and all throughout\n\n968\n00:57:50.970 --> 00:57:55.279\nthe file it would indicate exactly\nwhat each step along the way is doing.\n\n969\n00:57:56.680 --> 00:58:00.630\nAll right, so I'm gonna start by\nprompting me to enter in a user name for\n\n970\n00:58:00.630 --> 00:58:01.210\nthe new account.\n\n971\n00:58:01.210 --> 00:58:05.210\nSo when I run the script it's gonna ask\nme what do I want the user name to be.\n\n972\n00:58:05.210 --> 00:58:07.840\nNow when we run Echo, the default for\n\n973\n00:58:07.840 --> 00:58:10.780\nEcho is just the display\ninformation on the screen.\n\n974\n00:58:10.780 --> 00:58:15.280\nIf we do echo -e that says display\nsomething on the screen and\n\n975\n00:58:15.280 --> 00:58:18.010\nthen wait for user input.\n\n976\n00:58:18.010 --> 00:58:22.900\nNow, I used echo -e earlier in the bash\nrc script that we did or that function.\n\n977\n00:58:22.900 --> 00:58:26.790\nAnd I was using -e there because\nI was going to execute a command\n\n978\n00:58:26.790 --> 00:58:28.310\nto generate the output.\n\n979\n00:58:28.310 --> 00:58:30.030\nAnd so that semicolon at the end and\n\n980\n00:58:30.030 --> 00:58:32.860\nthen some data that basically\nsimulated the user input for me.\n\n981\n00:58:32.860 --> 00:58:36.940\nSo there wasn't actually input on\nother one but it kinda saw that way.\n\n982\n00:58:36.940 --> 00:58:38.380\nHere, I'm gonna have real input.\n\n983\n00:58:38.380 --> 00:58:45.750\nI'm gonna say, echo and\nI'll specify username like that, okay.\n\n984\n00:58:45.750 --> 00:58:49.980\nNow when that line runs, it's gonna\ndisplay on the screen username colon and\n\n985\n00:58:49.980 --> 00:58:53.710\nthen it's gonna sit there, and\nit's gonna wait for me to type something.\n\n986\n00:58:53.710 --> 00:58:58.480\nSo echo shows something on the screen,\necho -e shows something and\n\n987\n00:58:58.480 --> 00:59:00.850\nit waits for me to type back.\n\n988\n00:59:00.850 --> 00:59:04.730\nNow, when I type something back and\npress enter, What happens then?\n\n989\n00:59:04.730 --> 00:59:09.390\nWell, I need to use the read command,\nto read what I typed\n\n990\n00:59:10.570 --> 00:59:13.560\nand once you read it, you usually\nwant to stick it into a variable.\n\n991\n00:59:13.560 --> 00:59:16.540\nAnd that's what I want to do, I'm going\nto create a variable called username.\n\n992\n00:59:17.760 --> 00:59:21.110\nSo, I'm going to read whatever\nthe end user types and\n\n993\n00:59:21.110 --> 00:59:25.400\nstore it in variable called username,\nall right.\n\n994\n00:59:25.400 --> 00:59:29.560\nAnd from there I can now go and\ncreate the user, right.\n\n995\n00:59:29.560 --> 00:59:32.950\nAnd if I wanna go really simple,\nI could just specify that right here.\n\n996\n00:59:32.950 --> 00:59:38.700\nI could say useradd,\nwhatever we want it to be right?\n\n997\n00:59:38.700 --> 00:59:42.980\nSo that username would be $username, okay?\n\n998\n00:59:44.190 --> 00:59:48.600\nNow, this is a really simple script\nI'm going to build on this as we go.\n\n999\n00:59:48.600 --> 00:59:51.890\nBut for right now let's stop\nright here and see how it works.\n\n1000\n00:59:51.890 --> 00:59:56.480\nSo, if I want to create a user account and\nI want it to be, you know, a certain name.\n\n1001\n00:59:56.480 --> 00:59:59.430\nHere we go, it's got the basic information\nthat I need, and we can do it.\n\n1002\n00:59:59.430 --> 01:00:02.690\nActually, I'm gonna build on it\na little bit more right here.\n\n1003\n01:00:02.690 --> 01:00:04.940\nThis isn't quite as much\ninformation as I want.\n\n1004\n01:00:04.940 --> 01:00:10.300\nThere's some other things that I might\nwant, like the full name of the user,\n\n1005\n01:00:10.300 --> 01:00:13.840\nthe display name, as well as the password.\n\n1006\n01:00:13.840 --> 01:00:16.840\nWhich are additional values that I might\nwanna get, and so those are easy enough.\n\n1007\n01:00:16.840 --> 01:00:18.570\nI just add more echo statements.\n\n1008\n01:00:18.570 --> 01:00:23.598\nSo I can come in and I can say that was\nthe user name and then I can say echo\n\n1009\n01:00:23.598 --> 01:00:30.300\n-e full name.\n\n1010\n01:00:30.300 --> 01:00:35.312\nAnd then I can read that as fullname and\necho -e\n\n1011\n01:00:35.312 --> 01:00:41.540\n\"Password:\" and I can read that\ninto a variable called password.\n\n1012\n01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:47.680\nAnd now when I add that user,\nI can actually tack onto it a little bit.\n\n1013\n01:00:47.680 --> 01:00:52.550\nI can say, when we add a user its, what,\ndash c that let's us pull in a full\n\n1014\n01:00:52.550 --> 01:00:57.820\nname and\nnotice I'm putting full name in quotes.\n\n1015\n01:00:57.820 --> 01:01:02.340\nAnd the reason I'm doing that is fullname,\nsomebody's full name is almost always\n\n1016\n01:01:02.340 --> 01:01:05.650\ngonna have a space in it, right,\nfirst name space last name.\n\n1017\n01:01:05.650 --> 01:01:07.200\nAnd so\nthat can kind of throw off our command.\n\n1018\n01:01:07.200 --> 01:01:09.940\nAnytime you have spaces you\nhave to put quotes around it.\n\n1019\n01:01:09.940 --> 01:01:13.440\nSo I'm just saying useradd -c,\nthat means I'm giving it a full name,\n\n1020\n01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:16.950\nand then the full name within\nquotes to account for spaces.\n\n1021\n01:01:16.950 --> 01:01:19.662\nAnd then $username just show\nthat user name coming back.\n\n1022\n01:01:23.538 --> 01:01:24.060\nAll right.\n\n1023\n01:01:24.060 --> 01:01:26.800\nSo, any time you see dollar signs,\nso $fullname,\n\n1024\n01:01:26.800 --> 01:01:30.690\nthat means I'm querying that variable and\n$username, I'm querying that variable.\n\n1025\n01:01:30.690 --> 01:01:33.412\nAnd those variables were populated\nup here with our read commands.\n\n1026\n01:01:36.205 --> 01:01:37.080\nAll right.\n\n1027\n01:01:37.080 --> 01:01:41.020\nSo, it's gonna gather those three\nvariables right, user name,\n\n1028\n01:01:41.020 --> 01:01:45.830\nfull name, password and then it's going\nto run this command to create that\n\n1029\n01:01:45.830 --> 01:01:50.190\nuser account with that full name, with\nthat username, what about the password.\n\n1030\n01:01:50.190 --> 01:01:52.810\nRight, well I'm not pulling\nthe password here, so\n\n1031\n01:01:52.810 --> 01:01:58.311\nif I want to add that\nI can do -p $password.\n\n1032\n01:01:58.311 --> 01:02:02.070\nSo now it's going to feed in all\nthree of those into the system.\n\n1033\n01:02:02.070 --> 01:02:04.620\nThe more I could use the passwd command.\n\n1034\n01:02:04.620 --> 01:02:07.510\nThe passwd likes the,\nI know the password twice, and\n\n1035\n01:02:07.510 --> 01:02:10.860\nthere's no point in doing that here,\ncuz I'm doing this problematically.\n\n1036\n01:02:10.860 --> 01:02:12.220\nSo we'll just do it this way.\n\n1037\n01:02:13.900 --> 01:02:16.940\nAll right, so if I stop right there,\nthat's pretty good.\n\n1038\n01:02:16.940 --> 01:02:18.770\nIt's gonna ask me for the three values and\n\n1039\n01:02:18.770 --> 01:02:21.330\nthen it's gonna run the command\nto create that user account.\n\n1040\n01:02:21.330 --> 01:02:22.820\nWe'll see how that works.\n\n1041\n01:02:22.820 --> 01:02:25.470\nWe'll see if I have any typos.\n\n1042\n01:02:25.470 --> 01:02:28.220\nSo I'm gonna run ./newuser.sh.\n\n1043\n01:02:28.220 --> 01:02:33.010\nAnd it's prompting me for a username.\n\n1044\n01:02:33.010 --> 01:02:35.760\nSo I'm going to create\na user called John Doe,\n\n1045\n01:02:35.760 --> 01:02:39.470\nI'll do jdoe for the user name, all right.\n\n1046\n01:02:39.470 --> 01:02:42.000\nFor the full name I'll\ndo John space Doe and\n\n1047\n01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:46.234\nfor the password I'm just going\nto do password all lower case.\n\n1048\n01:02:46.234 --> 01:02:50.210\nAll right and then it's done.\n\n1049\n01:02:50.210 --> 01:02:54.150\nThe user account is created or\nat least in theory it's created.\n\n1050\n01:02:54.150 --> 01:02:55.410\nI can test that out.\n\n1051\n01:02:55.410 --> 01:02:58.810\nIf we jump over to one of my other TTY's.\n\n1052\n01:02:58.810 --> 01:03:00.230\nI can try to login as jdoe and\n\n1053\n01:03:00.230 --> 01:03:06.780\nI'll punch in his password and\nit's gonna think about it.\n\n1054\n01:03:06.780 --> 01:03:08.185\nShoot, it's disabled.\n\n1055\n01:03:08.185 --> 01:03:12.480\n[LAUGH] When you assign the password\nlike that with a user add command,\n\n1056\n01:03:12.480 --> 01:03:14.420\nthe account is actually disabled.\n\n1057\n01:03:14.420 --> 01:03:19.000\nSo that's why it's like that but\n\n1058\n01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:24.390\nit did create and\nwe can say id dash u jdoe.\n\n1059\n01:03:24.390 --> 01:03:25.120\nThere we go.\n\n1060\n01:03:25.120 --> 01:03:28.680\nSo I'm just verifying there is a user\naccount called jdoe they have user id 504.\n\n1061\n01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:30.990\nSo I know it created the user and\nthey're there.\n\n1062\n01:03:30.990 --> 01:03:31.490\nRight.\n\n1063\n01:03:32.790 --> 01:03:37.240\nNow my script works, it creates the user,\nit sets their name and so on.\n\n1064\n01:03:37.240 --> 01:03:38.059\nSo I know they're there.\n\n1065\n01:03:39.160 --> 01:03:44.070\nThere is a slight problem though my\nscript is very simplistic, all right?\n\n1066\n01:03:44.070 --> 01:03:46.594\nIt's just taking my input and\nfeeding it into a command.\n\n1067\n01:03:46.594 --> 01:03:48.949\nIt's not really doing any error checking.\n\n1068\n01:03:48.949 --> 01:03:52.269\nWhat if there's already\na user account called jdoe?\n\n1069\n01:03:52.269 --> 01:03:54.656\nRight?\nIs my script going to stop me?\n\n1070\n01:03:54.656 --> 01:03:59.598\nNo, if I try to do a new userscript,\nand I try and\n\n1071\n01:03:59.598 --> 01:04:06.690\ncreate another J Doe, and\nmaybe this is Joseph Doe, right?\n\n1072\n01:04:06.690 --> 01:04:11.210\nJoseph Doe, and I'll set his password,\nthere we go, and\n\n1073\n01:04:11.210 --> 01:04:14.750\nI get user add, user jdoe already exists.\n\n1074\n01:04:14.750 --> 01:04:19.140\nIt didn't stop me when I provided\nthat username, it let me keep going,\n\n1075\n01:04:19.140 --> 01:04:21.240\nspecifying a full name and a password, and\n\n1076\n01:04:21.240 --> 01:04:24.390\nit wasn't until the end it tells me\nthat user account already exists.\n\n1077\n01:04:24.390 --> 01:04:29.460\nMy script didn't do very\ngood error checking, so\n\n1078\n01:04:29.460 --> 01:04:31.580\nwhat do I do from here to fix this?\n\n1079\n01:04:31.580 --> 01:04:36.870\nWell, now I need to go and do a little\nbit of error checking in my script.\n\n1080\n01:04:42.547 --> 01:04:46.590\nI have to look up the syntax,\nbut I think I don't remember.\n\n1081\n01:04:46.590 --> 01:04:50.110\nIf you do -p, it might be expecting\nthe encrypted password and\n\n1082\n01:04:50.110 --> 01:04:52.490\nnot the unencrypted, and\nI fed it an unencrypted password, so\n\n1083\n01:04:52.490 --> 01:04:54.170\nthat might be why it failed also.\n\n1084\n01:04:54.170 --> 01:04:57.390\nThe user account is disabled or\nI'm feeding the password too long,\n\n1085\n01:04:57.390 --> 01:05:01.730\nbut you guys get the idea of how\nthe script is able to pass the commands to\n\n1086\n01:05:01.730 --> 01:05:04.910\npass the variables to the command,\nthat's my whole point.\n\n1087\n01:05:05.980 --> 01:05:08.000\nAll right, so what I'm gonna do is\nI'm gonna break this script up,\n\n1088\n01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.090\nI'm gonna do some error checking.\n\n1089\n01:05:10.090 --> 01:05:14.310\nWhen somebody enters in a username\nup here, before we move on,\n\n1090\n01:05:14.310 --> 01:05:18.130\nI wanna go ahead and check and\nsee if that user exists, okay?\n\n1091\n01:05:18.130 --> 01:05:22.370\nIt's pretty easy to do, every user has\nan ID, you saw how I checked a moment ago.\n\n1092\n01:05:22.370 --> 01:05:26.860\nI said id -u and a username,\nwhen I ran that,\n\n1093\n01:05:26.860 --> 01:05:29.370\nit'll return the user number for user.\n\n1094\n01:05:29.370 --> 01:05:32.260\nIf the user already exist,\nthey'll have a user ID number, right?\n\n1095\n01:05:33.320 --> 01:05:37.120\nSo, I can check and\nsee if the user has an ID number, and\n\n1096\n01:05:37.120 --> 01:05:40.300\nif they do, wonderful, they exist.\n\n1097\n01:05:40.300 --> 01:05:43.430\nIf they don't, then they don't exist and\nI can move on, and\n\n1098\n01:05:43.430 --> 01:05:46.770\nI can use that to stop\nthe process right then.\n\n1099\n01:05:46.770 --> 01:05:49.880\nDon't move forward, user already exists,\nyou're wasting your time.\n\n1100\n01:05:49.880 --> 01:05:52.160\nYou need to use a different username,\nokay?\n\n1101\n01:05:52.160 --> 01:05:56.810\nSo, we can take care of that kind of\nthing with what's called an if statement.\n\n1102\n01:05:56.810 --> 01:05:59.360\nAll right, if statements work like this.\n\n1103\n01:05:59.360 --> 01:06:03.854\nWith an if statement, you say,\n\n1104\n01:06:03.854 --> 01:06:08.848\nif something, then do something,\n\n1105\n01:06:08.848 --> 01:06:12.690\nelse, do something else.\n\n1106\n01:06:12.690 --> 01:06:15.860\nIf statements really build up with\nthree different statements, so if,\n\n1107\n01:06:15.860 --> 01:06:18.850\nand then you specify\nsome kind of condition.\n\n1108\n01:06:18.850 --> 01:06:19.920\nSomething you check, right?\n\n1109\n01:06:19.920 --> 01:06:25.170\nSo, if the user already exists,\nthen show an error,\n\n1110\n01:06:25.170 --> 01:06:26.530\ndon't let people move forward,\nshow an error.\n\n1111\n01:06:27.740 --> 01:06:31.929\nOtherwise or else go ahead and create the\nuser and continue on, go ahead and ask for\n\n1112\n01:06:31.929 --> 01:06:34.006\nthe full name and the password, right?\n\n1113\n01:06:34.006 --> 01:06:38.465\nIt's simple conditions, and\nthen they call it a branch in programming.\n\n1114\n01:06:38.465 --> 01:06:41.838\nThen we have a branch where,\nif the user exists, we go one way,\n\n1115\n01:06:41.838 --> 01:06:44.465\nif the user doesn't exist,\nwe go the other way.\n\n1116\n01:06:44.465 --> 01:06:48.032\nAll right, different decision trees as\nwe move through this application or\n\n1117\n01:06:48.032 --> 01:06:49.290\nthis script.\n\n1118\n01:06:49.290 --> 01:06:52.210\nI don't want to call it\nan application cuz it's so simple, but\n\n1119\n01:06:52.210 --> 01:06:57.170\nthat's basically what we have\nwhen we are writing a script and\n\n1120\n01:06:57.170 --> 01:06:59.180\nwe need to do if statements,\nso that's what I'm gonna do.\n\n1121\n01:06:59.180 --> 01:07:03.670\nI'm just gonna go up here and\nkind of branch things out.\n\n1122\n01:07:03.670 --> 01:07:08.290\nAfter I get that username, so\nthe user gets prompted for\n\n1123\n01:07:08.290 --> 01:07:12.140\na username, they type in the username,\nnow I need to do a check, okay?\n\n1124\n01:07:12.140 --> 01:07:18.940\nWhat I'm gonna do is I'm gonna\nsay if Id -u $username, okay?\n\n1125\n01:07:18.940 --> 01:07:22.390\nSo, I'm running the id -u\ncommand on that user, all right?\n\n1126\n01:07:23.860 --> 01:07:27.920\nIf that user exists, that command is\ngonna return to me their id number.\n\n1127\n01:07:29.260 --> 01:07:34.820\nWhen you create an install, your root\nuser is typically ID number zero,\n\n1128\n01:07:34.820 --> 01:07:37.820\nand then all your other users\nare created with a 500 or\n\n1129\n01:07:37.820 --> 01:07:40.520\nhigher, but it doesn't really\nmatter what number they are.\n\n1130\n01:07:40.520 --> 01:07:44.210\nThey get a number, and the number's\nnever going to be negative, and so\n\n1131\n01:07:44.210 --> 01:07:50.300\nwhat I like to do here is just say, if\nid -u username is greater than -1, okay,\n\n1132\n01:07:51.920 --> 01:07:57.410\nso if it's zero or higher, then it's\na number that I got a number back.\n\n1133\n01:07:57.410 --> 01:08:01.220\nIf it's zero or higher, and\nthat means that a user already exists, so\n\n1134\n01:08:01.220 --> 01:08:07.850\nif the user already exists, then I need\nto perform some kind of an action and\n\n1135\n01:08:07.850 --> 01:08:16.330\nmy action is going to be echo that\nusername already exists, okay?\n\n1136\n01:08:16.330 --> 01:08:21.800\nDon't create the user account,\nit already exists, you need stop, okay?\n\n1137\n01:08:24.572 --> 01:08:28.530\nOtherwise, else, then we move on and\n\n1138\n01:08:28.530 --> 01:08:31.850\nwe start doing these other\nthings if it doesn't exist.\n\n1139\n01:08:31.850 --> 01:08:35.020\nThen we'll go ahead and\nask for the full name.\n\n1140\n01:08:35.020 --> 01:08:39.050\nWe'll get that full name, we'll ask for\nthat password, we'll get that, and\n\n1141\n01:08:39.050 --> 01:08:43.339\nthen we will create that user account, so\ngo through each of those different steps.\n\n1142\n01:08:45.713 --> 01:08:50.660\nAll right, now another thing we might\nwanna do is other error checking, right?\n\n1143\n01:08:50.660 --> 01:08:54.380\nError checking to see whether\nthis process actually completed.\n\n1144\n01:08:54.380 --> 01:08:56.110\nI'm leaving something out.\n\n1145\n01:08:56.110 --> 01:08:58.370\nI did if, then, else.\n\n1146\n01:08:58.370 --> 01:09:01.160\nWe normally close off an if statement, so\n\n1147\n01:09:01.160 --> 01:09:05.150\nwe say at the beginning of the if\nstatement, that was way up here.\n\n1148\n01:09:05.150 --> 01:09:06.680\nAt the end of the if statement,\n\n1149\n01:09:06.680 --> 01:09:11.000\nwhen all of our work is done,\nwe typically throw in one more entry.\n\n1150\n01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:14.740\nWhere we say fi,\njust the word if backwards so\n\n1151\n01:09:14.740 --> 01:09:16.750\nthat now we've got a beginning and an end.\n\n1152\n01:09:16.750 --> 01:09:21.100\nThat's the end of our if statement, and\nnow we can start to run other things\n\n1153\n01:09:21.100 --> 01:09:26.210\nAnything after that fi will run,\nregardless of which branch we have.\n\n1154\n01:09:26.210 --> 01:09:30.360\nSo if the user already exists\nwe would echo this, and\n\n1155\n01:09:30.360 --> 01:09:32.170\nthen jump down to whatever was after fi.\n\n1156\n01:09:33.680 --> 01:09:36.710\nIf this wasn't true,\nthen we would do the else.\n\n1157\n01:09:36.710 --> 01:09:40.630\nWe would run this, and then jump\ndown to whatever's after fi, okay?\n\n1158\n01:09:40.630 --> 01:09:44.500\nWell, after fi, I don't really\nhave anything else I wanna do.\n\n1159\n01:09:44.500 --> 01:09:49.410\nI might say Echo script completed.\n\n1160\n01:09:49.410 --> 01:09:53.900\nOkay, and I'm not doing a \"dash E\",\nI don't wanna wait for any output or\n\n1161\n01:09:53.900 --> 01:09:55.360\nanything like that,\nI just want to echo that,\n\n1162\n01:09:55.360 --> 01:09:59.190\nI might choose to do a \"slash N\"\nto make sure it's on a new line,\n\n1163\n01:09:59.190 --> 01:10:03.100\nso it doesn't tack onto any other output\nBut I might just say script completed.\n\n1164\n01:10:03.100 --> 01:10:07.330\nSo now either way I go I'll get\nthat script completed at the end.\n\n1165\n01:10:07.330 --> 01:10:10.757\nThat's why we have that fi,\nto say that's the end of the if statement.\n\n1166\n01:10:13.423 --> 01:10:17.713\nNow if we want to get really powerful,\nyou can nest an if statement,\n\n1167\n01:10:17.713 --> 01:10:20.430\nInside of another if statement.\n\n1168\n01:10:20.430 --> 01:10:22.260\nI've already got one here that this is,\n\n1169\n01:10:22.260 --> 01:10:27.460\nif the user exists, then echo the username\nalready exist and then get out, right?.\n\n1170\n01:10:27.460 --> 01:10:30.850\nBut, what if I want to\ndo another if statement?\n\n1171\n01:10:30.850 --> 01:10:35.310\nLike down here, I might want to check to\nsee whether we actually successfully added\n\n1172\n01:10:35.310 --> 01:10:39.870\nthe user, so maybe I wanna do\nanother id -u of a username and\n\n1173\n01:10:39.870 --> 01:10:42.050\nverify the account actually created.\n\n1174\n01:10:42.050 --> 01:10:44.821\nIf it did, display a message saying\nit was done, and if it failed,\n\n1175\n01:10:44.821 --> 01:10:47.214\ndisplay a message saying\nsomething went wrong, right?\n\n1176\n01:10:47.214 --> 01:10:51.921\nThat's a basic part of error checking, but\nbefore I do that let's just test this and\n\n1177\n01:10:51.921 --> 01:10:53.797\nsee if it works the way that it is.\n\n1178\n01:10:53.797 --> 01:10:58.392\nYou never want to add too much because\nyou've got that chance of getting typos in\n\n1179\n01:10:58.392 --> 01:11:01.490\nthere, so let me just save that and\nwe'll try it out.\n\n1180\n01:11:03.320 --> 01:11:05.710\nSo, I'm going to create\na new user account and\n\n1181\n01:11:05.710 --> 01:11:08.490\nI'm going to creat done for J Doe, right?\n\n1182\n01:11:08.490 --> 01:11:11.620\nNow, I already know it exists,\nso when it runs the check,\n\n1183\n01:11:11.620 --> 01:11:15.350\nI get that username already exist and\nthe script completed.\n\n1184\n01:11:15.350 --> 01:11:18.310\nShoot, /n only works with the -e option,\n\n1185\n01:11:18.310 --> 01:11:21.360\nwhich I didn't do,\nI need to get a /n out of there.\n\n1186\n01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:23.690\nBut anyhow,\nI can see that username already exist and\n\n1187\n01:11:23.690 --> 01:11:27.300\nthen the script completed, all right?\n\n1188\n01:11:27.300 --> 01:11:30.170\nIf I try and run it again, and\nthis time I create one for another user,\n\n1189\n01:11:30.170 --> 01:11:31.550\nI'll create one for Christopher Walken.\n\n1190\n01:11:33.300 --> 01:11:36.763\nThere we go, and I get id cwalken,\nno such user, so\n\n1191\n01:11:36.763 --> 01:11:40.723\nnow it's asking me to go through and\ncreate the rest of it.\n\n1192\n01:11:40.723 --> 01:11:45.414\nSo I'll create one for Christopher,\nwe're not on nickname basis here, so\n\n1193\n01:11:45.414 --> 01:11:50.033\nI'll call him Christopher Walken,\nand then I'll punch in his password,\n\n1194\n01:11:50.033 --> 01:11:52.327\nand there we go, script completed.\n\n1195\n01:11:52.327 --> 01:11:54.658\nSo, I know my if statement is working.\n\n1196\n01:11:54.658 --> 01:11:58.250\nIf the user exists,\nit gives me an error, and it jumps out.\n\n1197\n01:11:58.250 --> 01:12:00.970\nIf the user doesn't exist,\nit tells me that, and then it moves,\n\n1198\n01:12:00.970 --> 01:12:02.260\nand I'm able to finish.\n\n1199\n01:12:02.260 --> 01:12:05.930\nAll right,\nlet's clean this script up a little bit.\n\n1200\n01:12:05.930 --> 01:12:08.460\nI forgot,\nthe /n only works when you do a -e.\n\n1201\n01:12:08.460 --> 01:12:14.210\nI don't wanna do a -e because cuz, well,\nI don't really need any user input at that\n\n1202\n01:12:14.210 --> 01:12:20.120\npoint, so I'm just gonna get that out\nof there, and echo Script Completed.\n\n1203\n01:12:20.120 --> 01:12:24.600\nWhat I want to do now is I want to add\nan extra little check here to make sure\n\n1204\n01:12:24.600 --> 01:12:29.100\nthat the user actually gets created\nright here after user add, and so\n\n1205\n01:12:29.100 --> 01:12:31.750\nwhat I'm gonna do is I'm\ngonna nest if statements.\n\n1206\n01:12:31.750 --> 01:12:36.280\nI'm gonna put one if statement\ninside of the other if statement.\n\n1207\n01:12:36.280 --> 01:12:42.840\nI'm gonna come in here and\nsay, if id-u$username\n\n1208\n01:12:42.840 --> 01:12:47.480\nis greater than -1, now notice that's\nthe same check I did above, well,\n\n1209\n01:12:47.480 --> 01:12:49.930\nabove I hadn't created the user yet.\n\n1210\n01:12:49.930 --> 01:12:54.880\nI'm trying to see if the user's already\nthere, but now I have created the user, so\n\n1211\n01:12:54.880 --> 01:12:57.570\nI'm just trying to verify\nthat it actually got created,\n\n1212\n01:12:57.570 --> 01:12:59.950\nthat nothing went wrong, okay?\n\n1213\n01:12:59.950 --> 01:13:05.230\nAnd so, I'll say if the id-u of\nthe username is greater than negative one,\n\n1214\n01:13:05.230 --> 01:13:10.667\nso if they got a number,\nthen I want to echo \"User\n\n1215\n01:13:10.667 --> 01:13:15.589\ncreated successfully\".\n\n1216\n01:13:15.589 --> 01:13:21.101\nThat is a long word, else I want\n\n1217\n01:13:21.101 --> 01:13:27.037\nto echo \"An error occurred while\n\n1218\n01:13:27.037 --> 01:13:33.194\ncreating the user\", like that.\n\n1219\n01:13:35.601 --> 01:13:40.529\nAnd then, I'll close out that if\nstatement, so what I end up with is one\n\n1220\n01:13:40.529 --> 01:13:45.460\nif statement right here, entirely\nnested under this else branch, and\n\n1221\n01:13:45.460 --> 01:13:49.840\nthen one big if statement\nthat incorporates that.\n\n1222\n01:13:49.840 --> 01:13:51.790\nIf the user already exists, we end,\n\n1223\n01:13:51.790 --> 01:13:56.660\nand we jump all the way down to this fi,\nand we echo script completed.\n\n1224\n01:13:56.660 --> 01:14:01.250\nBut if the user doesn't exist, We run\nthis, and after it creates the user,\n\n1225\n01:14:01.250 --> 01:14:03.770\nif it was successful,\nwe go into this branch.\n\n1226\n01:14:03.770 --> 01:14:06.130\nIf it wasn't successful,\nwe go into this branch.\n\n1227\n01:14:06.130 --> 01:14:10.100\nAnd either way, when they're done,\nthey jump down to the last fi, and\n\n1228\n01:14:10.100 --> 01:14:11.980\nwe see script completed.\n\n1229\n01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:14.226\nSo now I've got nested if statements.\n\n1230\n01:14:17.976 --> 01:14:23.184\nAll right, so I'll go ahead and just save,\nand now let's give script a shot.\n\n1231\n01:14:23.184 --> 01:14:26.385\nI'm gonna run new user and I'll try and\n\n1232\n01:14:26.385 --> 01:14:29.977\ncreate a user account for\nJ Doe, all right?\n\n1233\n01:14:29.977 --> 01:14:33.150\nThat username already exists,\nScript Completed so\n\n1234\n01:14:33.150 --> 01:14:37.340\nthat that's working properly and\nnow I'm gonna create an new user.\n\n1235\n01:14:37.340 --> 01:14:40.610\nMaybe I'll fo S Stallone, right?\n\n1236\n01:14:40.610 --> 01:14:43.660\nSo I'm going to create one,\nI get no such user, and so\n\n1237\n01:14:43.660 --> 01:14:46.570\nthis is going to be Sylvester Stallone.\n\n1238\n01:14:48.020 --> 01:14:49.700\nAll right, it's asking me for\nhis password,\n\n1239\n01:14:49.700 --> 01:14:54.360\nI'll punch that in and\nnow I get user created successfully.\n\n1240\n01:14:54.360 --> 01:14:59.020\nI checked the user did get a UID, I\ndidn't echo it to the screen or anything.\n\n1241\n01:14:59.020 --> 01:15:02.110\nI guess I could have, but I did it,\n\n1242\n01:15:02.110 --> 01:15:05.670\nit's created, script completed,\nnow I know the user account exists.\n\n1243\n01:15:05.670 --> 01:15:08.810\nIf an error had happened,\nI'd see it on the screen, all right?\n\n1244\n01:15:08.810 --> 01:15:11.370\nSo those are if statements and\nthey're incredibly useful.\n\n1245\n01:15:11.370 --> 01:15:13.980\nIf you're about to run\na series of 20 commands and\n\n1246\n01:15:13.980 --> 01:15:18.500\neach command builds on the one from\nbefore it, when one of those errors out,\n\n1247\n01:15:18.500 --> 01:15:20.930\nlet's say it's command\nnumber 12 that errors out.\n\n1248\n01:15:20.930 --> 01:15:25.410\nWell, you don't want 13 through 20 to run\nbecause something happened back at 12.\n\n1249\n01:15:25.410 --> 01:15:28.920\nYou need to stop, and\nthat's what if statements allow us to do.\n\n1250\n01:15:28.920 --> 01:15:34.385\nWe can run comparisons or criteria checks\nor whatever to make sure that what we ran\n\n1251\n01:15:34.385 --> 01:15:39.735\nActually worked, and only if it worked do\nwe progress further along in our script.\n\n1252\n01:15:39.735 --> 01:15:43.245\nThat's an important aspect\nof writing a good script.\n\n1253\n01:15:46.215 --> 01:15:49.930\nSo that's a slightly more advanced,\nVersion of a script now I don't want to\n\n1254\n01:15:49.930 --> 01:15:54.640\ncall it advanced because boy I've seen\nsome scripts out there that were amazing.\n\n1255\n01:15:54.640 --> 01:16:00.570\nDid all sorts of magic, but just for\nbasic script writing, it's not that hard.\n\n1256\n01:16:00.570 --> 01:16:04.080\nA lot of it's just understanding the\nterminology, how we talk to the computer,\n\n1257\n01:16:05.520 --> 01:16:09.720\nso we've seen a handful of commands\nthat can be used inside of a script.\n\n1258\n01:16:09.720 --> 01:16:14.780\nWe used if-then-else,\nwe saw echo, we saw read.\n\n1259\n01:16:14.780 --> 01:16:18.470\nIf we're actually seeing the variables,\nso we've seen a couple of things,\n\n1260\n01:16:18.470 --> 01:16:22.380\nthere are a lot of other little commands\nwe can use inside of the scripts.\n\n1261\n01:16:22.380 --> 01:16:25.570\nIn the exam objectives for\nthe LX0-102 exam,\n\n1262\n01:16:25.570 --> 01:16:30.620\nthey have a laundry list of them, and\nI was telling Ronnie before the show,\n\n1263\n01:16:30.620 --> 01:16:34.880\nI tried to come up with an idea for one\nscript that incorporated all the different\n\n1264\n01:16:34.880 --> 01:16:37.660\ncommands they had on the objectives and\nI just couldn't think of one.\n\n1265\n01:16:37.660 --> 01:16:41.370\nSo, what I did was I created a couple of\nsmaller scripts that show off a few of\n\n1266\n01:16:41.370 --> 01:16:44.390\nthe other commands they\nask you about on the exam.\n\n1267\n01:16:44.390 --> 01:16:50.368\nSo So those are, are most of them,\na few the other one's that we see\n\n1268\n01:16:50.368 --> 01:16:57.110\nare like for, sometimes you\ndon't just run a command once.\n\n1269\n01:16:57.110 --> 01:17:02.210\nYou might run a command more than\nonce based on certain criteria Okay?\n\n1270\n01:17:02.210 --> 01:17:06.990\nSo, if you've got a backup, you might want\nto run some kind of a copy operation for\n\n1271\n01:17:06.990 --> 01:17:09.190\neach file in a directory.\n\n1272\n01:17:09.190 --> 01:17:14.470\nAnd so, you can say for each file in this\ndirectory, run this command and it'll run\n\n1273\n01:17:14.470 --> 01:17:19.540\nthat command over and over and over again\nFor every single file in that directory.\n\n1274\n01:17:19.540 --> 01:17:23.690\nIt can be a thousand files in there and\nit'll run that command a thousand times.\n\n1275\n01:17:23.690 --> 01:17:28.980\nSo that's what the four command does,\nit a set up kind of repetitious processes.\n\n1276\n01:17:28.980 --> 01:17:32.430\nWe also have the do command\nwhich says perform an action.\n\n1277\n01:17:32.430 --> 01:17:35.580\nIf you wanna run some kind of\nan executable or command or\n\n1278\n01:17:35.580 --> 01:17:36.630\nwhatever you can use.\n\n1279\n01:17:36.630 --> 01:17:37.320\nDo to do it.\n\n1280\n01:17:37.320 --> 01:17:39.510\nNow you don't have to use do.\n\n1281\n01:17:39.510 --> 01:17:44.356\nI call the command in my script\nwithout using the do modifier.\n\n1282\n01:17:44.356 --> 01:17:48.100\nBut do is kind of nice because it\nreturns error information back.\n\n1283\n01:17:48.100 --> 01:17:50.360\nSo it'll let you know if the command\nwas successful or it failed and\n\n1284\n01:17:50.360 --> 01:17:51.470\nit'll let you numerically.\n\n1285\n01:17:51.470 --> 01:17:54.190\nSo you don't have to like\nparch the screen fro values.\n\n1286\n01:17:54.190 --> 01:17:56.450\nNot every command terminates cleanly and\n\n1287\n01:17:56.450 --> 01:18:00.890\nlets you know it's status so\ndo kind of correct for that.\n\n1288\n01:18:00.890 --> 01:18:06.840\nAnd another one I want to talk about in\nthis example will be sequence or SEQ.\n\n1289\n01:18:06.840 --> 01:18:11.160\nSometimes you need a series\nof numbers of the screen and\n\n1290\n01:18:11.160 --> 01:18:14.900\nsequence allows you to do it at its base.\n\n1291\n01:18:14.900 --> 01:18:16.830\nSeq followed by a number, like 5.\n\n1292\n01:18:16.830 --> 01:18:19.840\nIf I run seq 5, see what it did?\n\n1293\n01:18:19.840 --> 01:18:22.080\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5, pretty simple command.\n\n1294\n01:18:22.080 --> 01:18:25.230\nYou might ask yourself,\nhow the heck would I use that?\n\n1295\n01:18:25.230 --> 01:18:29.270\nWell, when you're doing iterations,\nwhen you're using the four command, and\n\n1296\n01:18:29.270 --> 01:18:32.110\nyou want to run a command ten times,\nright?\n\n1297\n01:18:32.110 --> 01:18:36.150\nYou can use the sequence command to build\nthat array 1 through 10 to actually\n\n1298\n01:18:36.150 --> 01:18:37.910\nexecute running that, right?\n\n1299\n01:18:37.910 --> 01:18:41.620\nIt sounds really confusing Let me\nshow you an example, all right?\n\n1300\n01:18:41.620 --> 01:18:46.280\nIn one of the earlier shows, I needed\nto create a bunch of video files, and\n\n1301\n01:18:46.280 --> 01:18:50.490\nso I ran touch ./video1.mp4, okay?\n\n1302\n01:18:50.490 --> 01:18:56.200\nI ran that, and then I hit my up arrow,\nand I changed it to 2,\n\n1303\n01:18:56.200 --> 01:19:00.100\nand then 3, and then so on, and\nI went through and I created those files.\n\n1304\n01:19:00.100 --> 01:19:03.720\nI just did it by hand real\nquick cuz it was fast, right?\n\n1305\n01:19:03.720 --> 01:19:06.030\nWhat if I needed\na thousand of those files?\n\n1306\n01:19:06.030 --> 01:19:08.350\nThere's no way I would have done it\nby hand, it would have been crazy.\n\n1307\n01:19:08.350 --> 01:19:13.980\nYou can write a quick script that would\nhave knocked that out real quick like.\n\n1308\n01:19:13.980 --> 01:19:18.740\nAll right, so I should have done a -f on\nthat to not have to say yes every time,\n\n1309\n01:19:18.740 --> 01:19:23.160\nbut anyhow we can write a script to\nknock that out pretty quick like, right?\n\n1310\n01:19:23.160 --> 01:19:30.142\nLet me show you what I mean, I'm gonna\ncreate a script called createvideos.sh.\n\n1311\n01:19:32.309 --> 01:19:36.804\nAll right, and just like we've been doing,\nI'm gonna put that\n\n1312\n01:19:36.804 --> 01:19:41.716\n#!/bin/bash at the beginning to\nlet it know that this is a script,\n\n1313\n01:19:41.716 --> 01:19:46.649\nand then I'm gonna feed it some of\nthose commands I just talked about.\n\n1314\n01:19:46.649 --> 01:19:51.244\nI'm gonna say for, F-O-R,\nwhich I just spelled wrong.\n\n1315\n01:19:51.244 --> 01:19:53.956\nFor, and then I'm gonna create a variable.\n\n1316\n01:19:53.956 --> 01:19:58.525\nOkay, so I'm gonna create a variable\ncalled filenum or file number.\n\n1317\n01:19:58.525 --> 01:20:03.708\nOkay, so four file number in seq,\n\n1318\n01:20:03.708 --> 01:20:07.567\nactually, you know what?\n\n1319\n01:20:07.567 --> 01:20:09.067\nI need backticks on this one.\n\n1320\n01:20:09.067 --> 01:20:15.810\nThere we go 'seq 10', now why am\nI putting backticks around that?\n\n1321\n01:20:15.810 --> 01:20:18.670\nI need it to actually\nrun the sequence command\n\n1322\n01:20:18.670 --> 01:20:21.930\nto generate that sequence of\nten numbers is what I'm doing.\n\n1323\n01:20:21.930 --> 01:20:26.846\nSo, it's gonna generate that list of\none through ten, so I'm saying for\n\n1324\n01:20:26.846 --> 01:20:29.317\nfile num in, this 1 to 10, okay?\n\n1325\n01:20:29.317 --> 01:20:33.838\nIt's basically creating one\nvariable called file num,\n\n1326\n01:20:33.838 --> 01:20:37.235\nand in it it's gonna contain 10 values.\n\n1327\n01:20:37.235 --> 01:20:44.074\nFor each of those 10 values,\nI want to do something, and\n\n1328\n01:20:44.074 --> 01:20:50.912\nthat something I'm gonna do is\ngoing to be, I will say do,\n\n1329\n01:20:50.912 --> 01:20:56.792\nand then I will say touch\nvideo $filenum.MP4.\n\n1330\n01:20:59.095 --> 01:21:02.860\nI'm saying, basically,\nI want you to run this command,\n\n1331\n01:21:02.860 --> 01:21:07.730\nI want you to run the touch\nvideo$filenum.mp4, and so\n\n1332\n01:21:07.730 --> 01:21:12.730\nit's gonna take $filenum and it's gonna\nreplace it with whatever is in there.\n\n1333\n01:21:12.730 --> 01:21:13.930\nWell, what is in there?\n\n1334\n01:21:13.930 --> 01:21:14.880\nWhat is in filenum?\n\n1335\n01:21:14.880 --> 01:21:18.690\nWell, there's a sequence of one\nthrough ten, so it's gonna run this.\n\n1336\n01:21:18.690 --> 01:21:22.330\nIt's gonna run touch video1.mp4,\nvideo2.mp4, video3.mp4.\n\n1337\n01:21:22.330 --> 01:21:28.110\nIt's gonna cycle through every one\nof those sequence numbers that's\n\n1338\n01:21:28.110 --> 01:21:32.960\nin this variable to create those ten files\nfor me, and it'll do it all at once.\n\n1339\n01:21:32.960 --> 01:21:36.060\nSo, if I want a thousand, I would just\nchange that sequence to a thousand,\n\n1340\n01:21:36.060 --> 01:21:40.380\nand it would create a thousand\nfiles called MP4, or\n\n1341\n01:21:40.380 --> 01:21:43.080\nI could just bump it up to 20 or\nwhatever it is that I want.\n\n1342\n01:21:43.080 --> 01:21:46.550\nNow, when you use the DO command, it's\nimportant that it knows when it's done, so\n\n1343\n01:21:46.550 --> 01:21:50.640\nI'm just going to add DONE to the end of\nit, and so that says, do this command And\n\n1344\n01:21:50.640 --> 01:21:54.190\nthen you're done,\nunless there's numbers that are left.\n\n1345\n01:21:54.190 --> 01:21:58.340\nFor, up here, it says, for\neach of these, so it's gonna do for\n\n1346\n01:21:58.340 --> 01:22:02.503\nthe first one,\nrun touch video$filename.mp4.\n\n1347\n01:22:02.503 --> 01:22:06.260\nThen for the second one, for\nthe third one, for the fourth one, and\n\n1348\n01:22:06.260 --> 01:22:11.880\nit's gonna cycle through all ten of them,\nrunning this touch command ten times.\n\n1349\n01:22:13.380 --> 01:22:17.510\nWhen it's done, I should be left\nwith ten files called video and\n\n1350\n01:22:17.510 --> 01:22:20.610\na number, all right?\n\n1351\n01:22:20.610 --> 01:22:22.860\nSo, let's save that and see how it does.\n\n1352\n01:22:22.860 --> 01:22:29.020\nI probably need to add the execute\nbit to it because I didn't do that,\n\n1353\n01:22:29.020 --> 01:22:33.120\nso I'll do that.\n\n1354\n01:22:33.120 --> 01:22:37.640\nLet me look at my directory first to\nmake sure I don't have any video files,\n\n1355\n01:22:39.050 --> 01:22:43.710\nso looking at it I've got VMware, and\nthat's the only thing that starts with V.\n\n1356\n01:22:43.710 --> 01:22:46.260\nI do have a videos folder and\nvideos2 folder, but\n\n1357\n01:22:46.260 --> 01:22:49.030\nI don't have any videos files, all right?\n\n1358\n01:22:49.030 --> 01:22:53.840\nSo I'm gonna run that createvideos.sh,\nand it's gonna run, and\n\n1359\n01:22:53.840 --> 01:22:56.870\nI didn't put any echoes in there,\nso I didn't get any output.\n\n1360\n01:22:56.870 --> 01:23:01.150\nI just kinda have to assume that it\nworked, and if I look at my directory,\n\n1361\n01:23:01.150 --> 01:23:07.000\nthere they are, video1 through 10.mp4,\nit created them for me.\n\n1362\n01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:10.270\nNow, if I had to create ten files\nHonestly, I'd probably still use my little\n\n1363\n01:23:10.270 --> 01:23:13.150\nup arrow method and just type them cuz\nit's faster than writing the script, but\n\n1364\n01:23:13.150 --> 01:23:16.310\nif you need me to create a thousand files,\nit just takes forever.\n\n1365\n01:23:17.330 --> 01:23:20.860\nPutting it into a script is\nmuch more convenient, and so\n\n1366\n01:23:20.860 --> 01:23:24.920\nif we take a look at that script again,\nlet's move it up on my screen here.\n\n1367\n01:23:26.600 --> 01:23:32.060\nAll right, you can see it right here,\nso for and it just creates a variable\n\n1368\n01:23:32.060 --> 01:23:36.790\nin sequence 10, so it's gonna play through\neach of that sequence putting that\n\n1369\n01:23:36.790 --> 01:23:40.590\nend of this variable, and it'll run\nthis command once for every instance.\n\n1370\n01:23:40.590 --> 01:23:42.720\nIt's gonna run it 10 times and create it.\n\n1371\n01:23:42.720 --> 01:23:47.670\nThat's an example on how to use four\nto cycle through a series of numbers or\n\n1372\n01:23:47.670 --> 01:23:52.010\nletters or whatever, and then to use\nthe do command to actually execute it, so\n\n1373\n01:23:52.010 --> 01:23:52.780\nthose are some other ones.\n\n1374\n01:23:53.940 --> 01:23:57.780\nNow like anything in Linux, there's\n20 different ways to do stuff, right?\n\n1375\n01:23:57.780 --> 01:24:02.850\nSo there's another way that I could have\ndone this instead of using The sequence\n\n1376\n01:24:02.850 --> 01:24:06.770\ncommand, we actually could have\nused just a count, all right,\n\n1377\n01:24:06.770 --> 01:24:11.000\nwhere we maintain a number and a variable\nand we decrement it each time it runs.\n\n1378\n01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:15.410\nSo that right there created my videos and\nit created videos one through ten and\n\n1379\n01:24:15.410 --> 01:24:16.950\nthat worked out well, right.\n\n1380\n01:24:16.950 --> 01:24:21.850\nLet me do, let me just remove all\nthose files that we just created.\n\n1381\n01:24:21.850 --> 01:24:23.580\nAll right, so they're all gone.\n\n1382\n01:24:23.580 --> 01:24:26.088\nSo that was create,\nwhat did I call that thing?\n\n1383\n01:24:26.088 --> 01:24:30.180\nCreatevideos.sh, all right.\n\n1384\n01:24:30.180 --> 01:24:34.930\nI'm gonna create another script and\nI want this one to be createvideos2.\n\n1385\n01:24:37.845 --> 01:24:38.420\n.sh.\n\n1386\n01:24:38.420 --> 01:24:41.840\nThis is gonna be my new upgraded one,\nright?\n\n1387\n01:24:41.840 --> 01:24:43.359\nAnd I'll add that execute bit.\n\n1388\n01:24:45.734 --> 01:24:47.366\nAll right, so I've got it in place, and\n\n1389\n01:24:47.366 --> 01:24:49.484\nI'm gonna write this one\na slightly different way.\n\n1390\n01:24:53.109 --> 01:24:54.170\nAll right.\n\n1391\n01:24:54.170 --> 01:24:58.644\nI'll start out the same way,\nthe good old /bin/bash.\n\n1392\n01:25:00.710 --> 01:25:01.920\nAnd on this one,\n\n1393\n01:25:01.920 --> 01:25:05.720\nI'm not gonna use the sequence to\ngenerate that list of one through ten.\n\n1394\n01:25:05.720 --> 01:25:10.840\nIt's just a number in my case, so I can\njust subtract by one every time it runs\n\n1395\n01:25:10.840 --> 01:25:12.380\nand we can do this\na slightly different way.\n\n1396\n01:25:12.380 --> 01:25:14.830\nI'm gonna create\na variable called filenum.\n\n1397\n01:25:16.020 --> 01:25:19.790\nAnd I'm going to start it at how\nmany files I want to create.\n\n1398\n01:25:19.790 --> 01:25:24.320\nI want to create ten files, or I could put\n20, 100, whatever it was that I wanted.\n\n1399\n01:25:24.320 --> 01:25:26.000\nThat's just my starting point.\n\n1400\n01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.670\nThat's what we're going to begin with,\nthat file number of ten.\n\n1401\n01:25:29.900 --> 01:25:33.090\nAnd then I'm going to\nuse the while command.\n\n1402\n01:25:33.090 --> 01:25:35.460\nWhile is a really cool command.\n\n1403\n01:25:35.460 --> 01:25:40.330\nBecause what it does is it says, we're\ngonna run thorough this series of events.\n\n1404\n01:25:40.330 --> 01:25:44.010\nAnd then as long as this\nparticular criteria is true,\n\n1405\n01:25:44.010 --> 01:25:46.840\nwe're gonna continue to\nloop through these events.\n\n1406\n01:25:46.840 --> 01:25:49.280\nSo it will loop over and\nover and over again.\n\n1407\n01:25:49.280 --> 01:25:52.480\nNow we did that a minute ago with\nthe do command, and the for command.\n\n1408\n01:25:52.480 --> 01:25:53.830\nSo we said for\n\n1409\n01:25:53.830 --> 01:25:59.050\nevery instance inside of this variable\nwe'll run this loop over and over again.\n\n1410\n01:25:59.050 --> 01:26:02.710\nBut here it's based on some\nother criteria we specify.\n\n1411\n01:26:02.710 --> 01:26:04.240\nWe can specify whatever criteria we want.\n\n1412\n01:26:04.240 --> 01:26:07.470\nIt's going to continue looping\nuntil our criteria's met.\n\n1413\n01:26:07.470 --> 01:26:10.440\nMaybe we want it to continue looping\nuntil a certain time happens.\n\n1414\n01:26:10.440 --> 01:26:14.400\nOr continue looping until You know,\nsome other event occurs, or\n\n1415\n01:26:14.400 --> 01:26:16.680\na file gets created,\nor something like that.\n\n1416\n01:26:16.680 --> 01:26:19.450\nIn my case, I want it to keep running\n\n1417\n01:26:19.450 --> 01:26:22.180\nas long as there's files left\nthat still need to be created.\n\n1418\n01:26:22.180 --> 01:26:26.030\nSo I'm gonna say while\n$ [INAUDIBLE] filenum.\n\n1419\n01:26:26.030 --> 01:26:30.310\nSo while that variable is greater than 0.\n\n1420\n01:26:30.310 --> 01:26:32.452\nSo -gt 0.\n\n1421\n01:26:32.452 --> 01:26:36.940\nAs long as the filenum variable\nhas something in it bigger than 0,\n\n1422\n01:26:36.940 --> 01:26:41.920\nI need to keep looping Because each\nloop is gonna create a file for me.\n\n1423\n01:26:41.920 --> 01:26:44.760\nAlright, and then I need to\nactually create that file and so\n\n1424\n01:26:44.760 --> 01:26:45.790\nI'll do what I did a moment ago.\n\n1425\n01:26:45.790 --> 01:26:50.910\nI'll say do touch video dollar sign\n\n1426\n01:26:50.910 --> 01:26:56.230\nfile num .mp4 but\nI'm gonna add one extra entry here,\n\n1427\n01:26:56.230 --> 01:27:01.710\nI'm gonna say after you create\nthe file Subtract one from filenum.\n\n1428\n01:27:01.710 --> 01:27:06.590\nWe'll say filenum=$.\n\n1429\n01:27:06.590 --> 01:27:09.130\nAnd we have to do some\nextra parentheses here.\n\n1430\n01:27:09.130 --> 01:27:12.360\nOtherwise, it'll just store our\nvalues right into the variable.\n\n1431\n01:27:12.360 --> 01:27:13.800\nSo I need it to actually perform the math.\n\n1432\n01:27:13.800 --> 01:27:15.410\nSo you have to do two parentheses.\n\n1433\n01:27:15.410 --> 01:27:19.476\nSo I want it to store $filenum -1.\n\n1434\n01:27:19.476 --> 01:27:24.596\nSo I create video$filenum,\n\n1435\n01:27:24.596 --> 01:27:31.410\nnow $filenum starts out as 10 so\nI'm creating video10.mp4.\n\n1436\n01:27:31.410 --> 01:27:34.840\nThen, we subtract 1 from filenum.\n\n1437\n01:27:34.840 --> 01:27:37.920\nSo filenum goes from ten down to nine.\n\n1438\n01:27:37.920 --> 01:27:42.050\nwhile will run and say,\nis nine greater than zero?\n\n1439\n01:27:42.050 --> 01:27:44.420\nYes, and so then it'll run this.\n\n1440\n01:27:44.420 --> 01:27:45.210\nAnd it'll create video9.\n\n1441\n01:27:45.210 --> 01:27:48.314\nAnd then it'll subtract one and\nfilenum becomes eight.\n\n1442\n01:27:48.314 --> 01:27:52.819\nAnd it'll say, is eight greater than zero?\n\n1443\n01:27:52.819 --> 01:27:54.832\nYes, and it'll keep doing that.\n\n1444\n01:27:54.832 --> 01:28:00.111\nAnd when I get down to video 1, it'll\nsay ($filenum- 1), and it'll become 0.\n\n1445\n01:28:00.111 --> 01:28:02.912\nAnd here it'll say, all right,\nis [ $filenum -gt 0 ]?\n\n1446\n01:28:02.912 --> 01:28:07.220\nOne knows, 0 is equal to 0, and\nso then it'll stop looping and\n\n1447\n01:28:07.220 --> 01:28:10.640\nit'll move beyond it to where we say,\ndone.\n\n1448\n01:28:10.640 --> 01:28:15.790\nOkay, this is the exact same\nresult as the other script.\n\n1449\n01:28:15.790 --> 01:28:17.270\nI'm just doing it in a different way.\n\n1450\n01:28:17.270 --> 01:28:18.520\nI'm not using sequence and\n\n1451\n01:28:18.520 --> 01:28:23.140\nI'm not using for, instead I'm using\na variable that I created, filenum.\n\n1452\n01:28:23.140 --> 01:28:27.003\nAnd just decrementing it, each time,\nevery time we loop I remove 1 from it.\n\n1453\n01:28:27.003 --> 01:28:31.976\nAnd so, it's counting down until it\nreaches that point when it's done,\n\n1454\n01:28:31.976 --> 01:28:32.788\nall right?\n\n1455\n01:28:32.788 --> 01:28:37.688\nSo, if I save this, all right?\n\n1456\n01:28:37.688 --> 01:28:44.646\nI don't have those video files and\nif I run createvideos2.sh, it's gonna run.\n\n1457\n01:28:44.646 --> 01:28:49.890\nAnd now I've got video 1 through 10,\njust like before.\n\n1458\n01:28:49.890 --> 01:28:54.050\nOkay, so same result,\ntwo different ways to go about it.\n\n1459\n01:28:54.050 --> 01:28:56.750\nAnd that's something that is very common.\n\n1460\n01:28:58.190 --> 01:29:03.186\nIn the Linux world there's almost always\nmore than one way to do something.\n\n1461\n01:29:03.186 --> 01:29:07.680\nSo, I use the seq command here\nto create that list of ten, and\n\n1462\n01:29:07.680 --> 01:29:09.900\nthen create video files based on the list.\n\n1463\n01:29:09.900 --> 01:29:13.030\nOr here, I just used a variable,\ndecremented it each time,\n\n1464\n01:29:13.030 --> 01:29:16.130\nand had it create the ten that way too,\nall right?\n\n1465\n01:29:16.130 --> 01:29:16.940\nWhich one's the right way?\n\n1466\n01:29:18.240 --> 01:29:19.967\nThey're both right, right?\nThe right way is whichever one you can\n\n1467\n01:29:19.967 --> 01:29:20.724\nremember, right?\n\n1468\n01:29:20.724 --> 01:29:22.847\n[LAUGH] So\nwhichever one you can remember or\n\n1469\n01:29:22.847 --> 01:29:26.310\nyou can look up in the documentation\nfirst, that's the best.\n\n1470\n01:29:26.310 --> 01:29:29.910\nThere are times when there's one way that\nmight be more efficient than another.\n\n1471\n01:29:29.910 --> 01:29:34.510\nBut at the end of the day, both of these\nmethods work, you might as well use them,\n\n1472\n01:29:34.510 --> 01:29:35.800\nall right?\n\n1473\n01:29:35.800 --> 01:29:39.480\nSo those are some examples of things\nthat we do inside of a script.\n\n1474\n01:29:39.480 --> 01:29:41.358\nIs there anything I left off?\n\n1475\n01:29:41.358 --> 01:29:43.404\nThere is one other one.\n\n1476\n01:29:43.404 --> 01:29:45.692\nI won't write a script for\nthis one, we'll just do a command.\n\n1477\n01:29:45.692 --> 01:29:48.820\nBut there's another\ncommand that you can use.\n\n1478\n01:29:48.820 --> 01:29:51.410\nRemember, how I did\na little error checking?\n\n1479\n01:29:51.410 --> 01:29:55.750\nI ran id -u to see if\na user already existed.\n\n1480\n01:29:55.750 --> 01:29:58.450\nThere is actually a command called test.\n\n1481\n01:29:58.450 --> 01:30:04.690\nAnd test will allow you to run some kind\nof a criteria to see if something happens.\n\n1482\n01:30:04.690 --> 01:30:09.750\nAnd if it does, it can return a value\nif it's true or a value if it's false.\n\n1483\n01:30:09.750 --> 01:30:12.060\nSo it's really useful for error checking.\n\n1484\n01:30:12.060 --> 01:30:13.410\nThe test command works like this.\n\n1485\n01:30:15.230 --> 01:30:18.420\nWith my user account that we made earlier,\nmaybe I want to test and\n\n1486\n01:30:18.420 --> 01:30:20.800\nsee if the user actually got\na home directory, right?\n\n1487\n01:30:20.800 --> 01:30:21.850\nSo as part of my error checking,\n\n1488\n01:30:21.850 --> 01:30:25.180\nI want to see if their home\ndirectory got created, okay?\n\n1489\n01:30:25.180 --> 01:30:26.670\nSo we can use the test command.\n\n1490\n01:30:26.670 --> 01:30:30.324\nTest actually has several command\nmodifiers that let it check for\n\n1491\n01:30:30.324 --> 01:30:31.525\nall sorts of things.\n\n1492\n01:30:31.525 --> 01:30:36.994\nNormally you write an expression,\ntest if 1 is greater than 0.\n\n1493\n01:30:36.994 --> 01:30:41.620\nIf 1 is greater than 0 then true, do this,\nif 1 less than 0, do this, right?\n\n1494\n01:30:41.620 --> 01:30:43.590\nThat will obviously always be true.\n\n1495\n01:30:43.590 --> 01:30:47.940\nBut we can check for whether files\nexists or whether folders exists.\n\n1496\n01:30:47.940 --> 01:30:48.925\nSee all these different ones?\n\n1497\n01:30:48.925 --> 01:30:53.690\n-b FILE exists and is block special,\ncharacter special, whatever.\n\n1498\n01:30:53.690 --> 01:30:57.195\nYou can do -d if a FILE exists and\nis a directory.\n\n1499\n01:30:57.195 --> 01:30:59.800\n-e, just does the FILE exist.\n\n1500\n01:30:59.800 --> 01:31:01.200\nAll sorts of different things.\n\n1501\n01:31:01.200 --> 01:31:02.170\nAnd those are the file ones,\n\n1502\n01:31:02.170 --> 01:31:06.620\nyou can write your own criteria,\ncomparing one variable to another.\n\n1503\n01:31:06.620 --> 01:31:08.210\nTest is very powerful.\n\n1504\n01:31:08.210 --> 01:31:09.887\nI usually use it to see\nif files exist already.\n\n1505\n01:31:09.887 --> 01:31:14.401\nSo I can say something like,\ntest -d /home/, and\n\n1506\n01:31:14.401 --> 01:31:20.671\nif I was doing this in a file,\nI would reference like $username, okay?\n\n1507\n01:31:20.671 --> 01:31:22.830\nWell actually, you know what,\nlet me do this, I'm gonna make that.\n\n1508\n01:31:22.830 --> 01:31:26.210\nI'll just say username=dpezet.\n\n1509\n01:31:26.210 --> 01:31:27.570\nDeep hazard.\n\n1510\n01:31:27.570 --> 01:31:29.031\nAnd then I'll say test.\n\n1511\n01:31:29.031 --> 01:31:36.194\nAnd I'm gonna test -d /home/$username,\nokay?\n\n1512\n01:31:36.194 --> 01:31:42.120\nSo it's checking to see if a directory\nexists that's called /home/dpezet, okay?\n\n1513\n01:31:42.120 --> 01:31:44.520\nCuz that's the variable\nthat it's pulling from.\n\n1514\n01:31:44.520 --> 01:31:48.085\nAnd then we do a double ampersand to\nsay that's the end of the command,\n\n1515\n01:31:48.085 --> 01:31:50.450\ncuz it's gotta know\nwhere that command ends.\n\n1516\n01:31:50.450 --> 01:31:53.828\nAnd now we give it our true and\nfalse values, okay?\n\n1517\n01:31:53.828 --> 01:31:55.610\nWe start with the true.\n\n1518\n01:31:55.610 --> 01:32:02.508\nAnd so I'll just say something\nlike echo \"Home Directory Exists\".\n\n1519\n01:32:02.508 --> 01:32:06.360\nThis is gonna hit into my head, isn't it?\n\n1520\n01:32:06.360 --> 01:32:09.430\nLet me, let me clear my screen.\n\n1521\n01:32:10.650 --> 01:32:11.150\nAll right.\n\n1522\n01:32:12.330 --> 01:32:12.830\nHere we go.\n\n1523\n01:32:15.480 --> 01:32:17.419\nSo I'm gonna say \"Home Directory Exists\".\n\n1524\n01:32:18.490 --> 01:32:23.920\nAnd then I'll do a double pipe symbol\nto say that's one alternative.\n\n1525\n01:32:23.920 --> 01:32:27.320\nIf it's false, here's the or,\nthe other thing that we'll say.\n\n1526\n01:32:27.320 --> 01:32:31.730\nWe'll say \"Home Directory,\nmy typing skills,\n\n1527\n01:32:31.730 --> 01:32:36.020\n\"Home Directory Does Not Exist\", okay?\n\n1528\n01:32:36.020 --> 01:32:41.290\nSo, if it's true, we return what's\non the left of the double pipes.\n\n1529\n01:32:41.290 --> 01:32:43.445\nIf it's false, we return what's\non the right of the double pipes.\n\n1530\n01:32:43.445 --> 01:32:46.761\nSo a quick easy way to do checking for\nerrors if, and\n\n1531\n01:32:46.761 --> 01:32:50.634\nI'm using -d to check that,\nbut you can do an expression.\n\n1532\n01:32:50.634 --> 01:32:57.790\nYou could say,\nif $count is greater than 0, return true.\n\n1533\n01:32:57.790 --> 01:32:58.830\nIf it's not, return false.\n\n1534\n01:32:58.830 --> 01:33:01.750\nAnd you could specify whatever\nyou wanted in this, all right?\n\n1535\n01:33:01.750 --> 01:33:05.563\nSo when I run that, it checks that\nusername variable and says all right,\n\n1536\n01:33:05.563 --> 01:33:07.460\ndoes that user account exist?\n\n1537\n01:33:07.460 --> 01:33:09.750\nYeah, or in the home directory, at least.\n\n1538\n01:33:09.750 --> 01:33:11.950\nAll right, so actually, did I get, no.\n\n1539\n01:33:11.950 --> 01:33:14.190\nSorry, it looked like I got\nboth just cuz it word wrapped.\n\n1540\n01:33:14.190 --> 01:33:16.630\nBut yeah, its Home Directory Exists.\n\n1541\n01:33:16.630 --> 01:33:21.040\nIf I change that variable to,\nmaybe donpezet, right?\n\n1542\n01:33:21.040 --> 01:33:25.070\nNow it's gonna look and\nsee if there's a /home/donpezet instead.\n\n1543\n01:33:25.070 --> 01:33:28.790\nAnd it should return,\nHome Directory Does Not Exist.\n\n1544\n01:33:28.790 --> 01:33:30.450\nYou know, I forgot an echo, or didn't I?\n\n1545\n01:33:30.450 --> 01:33:31.440\nYep.\n\n1546\n01:33:31.440 --> 01:33:34.760\nIn my false statement, I forgot to\ninclude the word echo at the beginning,\n\n1547\n01:33:34.760 --> 01:33:36.800\nthat's why I'm getting command not found.\n\n1548\n01:33:36.800 --> 01:33:38.723\nThere we go, now I get,\nHome Directory Does Not Exist.\n\n1549\n01:33:38.723 --> 01:33:43.008\nSo, kind of a neat command,\njust a quick way to do tests.\n\n1550\n01:33:43.008 --> 01:33:45.878\nIf you're checking for something and\nyou don't have a good way to get\n\n1551\n01:33:45.878 --> 01:33:48.420\nerror reporting on it,\nyou can use the test command to do it.\n\n1552\n01:33:48.420 --> 01:33:49.910\nSo it's a useful one inside a script.\n\n1553\n01:33:51.600 --> 01:33:57.080\nAll right, well Ronnie I think that, that\nwraps up the basic commands for scripting.\n\n1554\n01:33:57.080 --> 01:34:01.830\nThe exam for the CompTIA Linux+ and\nfor the LPIC-1,\n\n1555\n01:34:01.830 --> 01:34:06.150\nthey don't expect you to be a script\nwizard, to know programming, and so on.\n\n1556\n01:34:06.150 --> 01:34:09.280\nThey just want you to have the basic\nskills to whip up a script if you need to\n\n1557\n01:34:09.280 --> 01:34:10.880\nmake your life easier.\n\n1558\n01:34:10.880 --> 01:34:13.250\nYou'll find that people write\nsome really complex ones.\n\n1559\n01:34:13.250 --> 01:34:16.530\nAnd if you move on to do LPIC-2,\n3, or 4, yeah,\n\n1560\n01:34:16.530 --> 01:34:18.650\nthey start to get a lot\nmore involved in that.\n\n1561\n01:34:18.650 --> 01:34:20.330\nAnd so you do need to have\nthat higher level knowledge.\n\n1562\n01:34:20.330 --> 01:34:22.040\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n1563\n01:34:23.730 --> 01:34:25.950\nAll right, well let's do this, Ronnie.\n\n1564\n01:34:25.950 --> 01:34:29.510\nSo the next thing we need to\ntalk about is SQL script.\n\n1565\n01:34:29.510 --> 01:34:31.900\nNot script, but just the query language.\n\n1566\n01:34:31.900 --> 01:34:33.320\nSo let's stop and take a break.\n\n1567\n01:34:33.320 --> 01:34:37.595\nAnd when we get back, we'll jump into\nthat wonderful world of sequel, right?\n\n1568\n01:34:37.595 --> 01:34:38.917\n>> And I shouldn't call sequel, right?\n\n1569\n01:34:38.917 --> 01:34:39.951\nThat's Microsoft.\n>> SQL.\n\n1570\n01:34:39.951 --> 01:34:40.601\n>> SQL.\n\n1571\n01:34:40.601 --> 01:34:41.596\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n1572\n01:34:41.596 --> 01:34:44.508\ngive us a chance to kind of see how to\ninteract with databases which have their\n\n1573\n01:34:44.508 --> 01:34:45.975\nown little language that they speak.\n\n1574\n01:34:45.975 --> 01:34:48.169\nSo stay tuned, we'll be back after this.\n\n1575\n01:34:48.169 --> 01:34:55.700\n[MUSIC]\n\n1576\n01:34:55.700 --> 01:34:58.160\nAll right, welcome back everybody.\n\n1577\n01:34:58.160 --> 01:34:59.420\nSo for our last segment,\n\n1578\n01:34:59.420 --> 01:35:03.480\nwe're gonna take a look at an entirely\ndifferent type of scripting.\n\n1579\n01:35:04.805 --> 01:35:08.990\nCompTIA and\nthe LPI have added basic SQL knowledge,\n\n1580\n01:35:08.990 --> 01:35:14.120\nthe structured query language, standard\nquery knowledge, knowledge to the exam.\n\n1581\n01:35:14.120 --> 01:35:18.240\nSo we have to have a basic understanding\nof how to interact with database servers.\n\n1582\n01:35:18.240 --> 01:35:20.730\nAnd databases are commonplace.\n\n1583\n01:35:20.730 --> 01:35:23.580\nPretty much every business\nuses databases of some sort or\n\n1584\n01:35:23.580 --> 01:35:28.410\nanother in their production line of work,\nin their line of business applications.\n\n1585\n01:35:28.410 --> 01:35:30.740\nSo as an administrator,\nwe might never have to touch those.\n\n1586\n01:35:30.740 --> 01:35:34.060\nWe might have database administrators,\nor DBAs, that do it for us.\n\n1587\n01:35:34.060 --> 01:35:37.120\nBut it is useful to have at\nleast a basic understanding.\n\n1588\n01:35:37.120 --> 01:35:38.585\nAnd I can tell you,\n\n1589\n01:35:38.585 --> 01:35:44.364\nover the last few weeks I have written\nmore SQL queries that I have in years.\n\n1590\n01:35:44.364 --> 01:35:47.983\nThere are a lot of times where it's very\nuseful to be able to reach into a database\n\n1591\n01:35:47.983 --> 01:35:48.697\nand get it out.\n\n1592\n01:35:48.697 --> 01:35:51.370\nSo, I don't want to blow your minds\nbecause I know a lot of you guys might not\n\n1593\n01:35:51.370 --> 01:35:52.437\nhave worked with databases.\n\n1594\n01:35:52.437 --> 01:35:55.017\nSome of you guys might\nbe database experts.\n\n1595\n01:35:55.017 --> 01:35:58.234\nBut for a lot of people they just\nhaven't worked with them directly so\n\n1596\n01:35:58.234 --> 01:36:01.675\nwe wanna cover some of the basic commands,\nhow they work and what they do so\n\n1597\n01:36:01.675 --> 01:36:04.430\nthat you're familiar with them for\nthe exam.\n\n1598\n01:36:04.430 --> 01:36:07.250\nNow, the first thing we need if we're\ngonna work with databases is we probably\n\n1599\n01:36:07.250 --> 01:36:08.840\nneed a database.\n\n1600\n01:36:08.840 --> 01:36:13.590\nAnd the most common database server\nin the Linus world is MySQL.\n\n1601\n01:36:13.590 --> 01:36:17.020\nMySQL, it's an open source database\nthat is actually owned by Oracle now,\n\n1602\n01:36:17.020 --> 01:36:19.020\nwhich a lot of people aren't happy about.\n\n1603\n01:36:19.020 --> 01:36:19.910\nBut I'm gonna use it.\n\n1604\n01:36:19.910 --> 01:36:21.640\nSo let me get it installed.\n\n1605\n01:36:21.640 --> 01:36:24.080\nI might have installed it in another show.\n\n1606\n01:36:24.080 --> 01:36:25.070\nI can't remember.\n\n1607\n01:36:25.070 --> 01:36:27.720\nSo I'm just gonna run\nthrough a quick install here.\n\n1608\n01:36:27.720 --> 01:36:29.500\nSo let's take a look at my machine.\n\n1609\n01:36:29.500 --> 01:36:35.600\nAnd to install it,\nwe just say yum install mysql-server,\n\n1610\n01:36:35.600 --> 01:36:41.040\nif you are on a Debian based box,\nyou'd say ap dash get and do MySQL server.\n\n1611\n01:36:41.040 --> 01:36:43.240\nSo we'll go ahead and do it,\nand, I did install it.\n\n1612\n01:36:43.240 --> 01:36:45.710\nSo I've already got it on my system,\nall right.\n\n1613\n01:36:46.860 --> 01:36:49.850\nNow, when you install MySQL,\nit's not actually running by default.\n\n1614\n01:36:49.850 --> 01:36:54.750\nWe do need to, to get some, some basic\nstuff put in place so that it'll work.\n\n1615\n01:36:54.750 --> 01:36:58.880\nI'm gonna go ahead and start the service,\nif it's not running already.\n\n1616\n01:36:58.880 --> 01:37:02.910\nSo I will say, service mysqld start,\n\n1617\n01:37:02.910 --> 01:37:06.360\nthat's gonna start that one up\nif it's not running already.\n\n1618\n01:37:06.360 --> 01:37:07.480\nThere it goes.\n\n1619\n01:37:07.480 --> 01:37:10.580\nAnd then if this is the first\ntime you've run it,\n\n1620\n01:37:10.580 --> 01:37:13.940\nthere's actually a little secure\nconfiguration script that we need to use.\n\n1621\n01:37:13.940 --> 01:37:16.450\nWell you don't have to use it but\nit's a really good idea.\n\n1622\n01:37:16.450 --> 01:37:21.400\nSo I'm gonna run that script and\nso it's just, it's tucked away\n\n1623\n01:37:21.400 --> 01:37:26.308\nunder /usr/bin And\nit is the mysql_secure_installation.\n\n1624\n01:37:26.308 --> 01:37:30.300\nYou'd be surprised the default install,\nthe root account for it has no password,\n\n1625\n01:37:30.300 --> 01:37:32.320\nthere's a lot of stuff that is\nnot very secure about this.\n\n1626\n01:37:32.320 --> 01:37:35.390\nSo you never want to run\nMySQL right out of the box,\n\n1627\n01:37:35.390 --> 01:37:38.130\nyou always want to run this\nsecure installation script.\n\n1628\n01:37:38.130 --> 01:37:45.896\nIt's /usr /bin/mysql_secure_installation.\n\n1629\n01:37:45.896 --> 01:37:47.521\nAnd it just runs you\nthrough some simple things.\n\n1630\n01:37:47.521 --> 01:37:50.180\nIt asks for your current root\npassword if you have one.\n\n1631\n01:37:50.180 --> 01:37:51.302\nI'm assuming I don't.\n\n1632\n01:37:51.302 --> 01:37:53.090\nApparently I already do.\n\n1633\n01:37:53.090 --> 01:37:54.720\nI must have already run this.\n\n1634\n01:37:54.720 --> 01:37:56.410\nSo I've already got one.\n\n1635\n01:37:56.410 --> 01:37:58.560\nNormally if you just did\nthe install you don't have one.\n\n1636\n01:37:58.560 --> 01:38:00.630\nSo you just press enter on that line and\n\n1637\n01:38:00.630 --> 01:38:02.810\nthen you can change it to\nsomething else if you want.\n\n1638\n01:38:02.810 --> 01:38:05.190\nSo you'd say yes here and\npunch in the new password.\n\n1639\n01:38:05.190 --> 01:38:07.410\nSince I already assigned one I'll say no.\n\n1640\n01:38:07.410 --> 01:38:10.170\nThen it asks if you want\nto remove anonymous users.\n\n1641\n01:38:10.170 --> 01:38:13.871\nThe default database as\nit's created allows for\n\n1642\n01:38:13.871 --> 01:38:18.020\nanybody to be able to reach in and\njust query data.\n\n1643\n01:38:18.020 --> 01:38:18.780\nYou might not want that.\n\n1644\n01:38:18.780 --> 01:38:21.150\nSo I'll say yes to remove those.\n\n1645\n01:38:21.150 --> 01:38:25.610\nThe root account, the superuser account\nto be able to access this database,\n\n1646\n01:38:25.610 --> 01:38:28.860\nby default it can access\nthe system from the local machine\n\n1647\n01:38:28.860 --> 01:38:30.950\nas well as from remote machines.\n\n1648\n01:38:30.950 --> 01:38:33.420\nAnd if an attacker's trying to break\ninto your system, they're remote.\n\n1649\n01:38:34.470 --> 01:38:35.570\nSo you likely don't want that so\n\n1650\n01:38:35.570 --> 01:38:38.770\nit's a good idea to disallow\nroot access via the network.\n\n1651\n01:38:38.770 --> 01:38:40.313\nThe root user can only log in locally.\n\n1652\n01:38:42.688 --> 01:38:46.353\nAnd then there's a test database,\njust a sample database that's created for\n\n1653\n01:38:46.353 --> 01:38:47.840\nyou to mess around with.\n\n1654\n01:38:47.840 --> 01:38:50.080\nIf you don't want it anymore,\nyou can say yes to delete it.\n\n1655\n01:38:50.080 --> 01:38:52.429\nI'm actually gonna keep it,\ncuz I'll use it here for my example.\n\n1656\n01:38:54.430 --> 01:38:56.190\nAnd then it'll reload the privilege table.\n\n1657\n01:38:56.190 --> 01:39:00.062\nI'll say just yes to that.\n\n1658\n01:39:00.062 --> 01:39:03.264\nAll right, so now I've got\na MySQL database server up and\n\n1659\n01:39:03.264 --> 01:39:05.880\nrunning that hopefully\nhas my test database.\n\n1660\n01:39:07.350 --> 01:39:09.260\nLet's connect to it and take a look.\n\n1661\n01:39:09.260 --> 01:39:12.530\nTo interact with this database server\nwe need to use the MySQL Clients,\n\n1662\n01:39:12.530 --> 01:39:14.790\nwhich was installed when\nwe installed the server.\n\n1663\n01:39:14.790 --> 01:39:15.832\nSo we're in good shape there.\n\n1664\n01:39:15.832 --> 01:39:19.770\nIf you're on a different work station,\nyou would say yum install mysql,\n\n1665\n01:39:19.770 --> 01:39:24.750\nand that actually installs the client,\n-server is what puts the server on there.\n\n1666\n01:39:24.750 --> 01:39:26.550\nBut, so\nwe should already have that client.\n\n1667\n01:39:26.550 --> 01:39:31.267\nSo I'm just gonna run mysql and I'm\nlogged in as root, so the default is it's\n\n1668\n01:39:31.267 --> 01:39:35.854\ngonna log in as whoever you are, and\nthen you specify -p for the password.\n\n1669\n01:39:35.854 --> 01:39:38.520\nAnd my password was just the word\npassword, all lower case.\n\n1670\n01:39:40.430 --> 01:39:41.940\nSo that's gonna connect and\n\n1671\n01:39:41.940 --> 01:39:44.180\nnow I'm connected to the database server,\nall right.\n\n1672\n01:39:44.180 --> 01:39:47.453\nNow we'll see my prompt has changed so\nI've got mysqul>.\n\n1673\n01:39:47.453 --> 01:39:49.620\nNow what do I do?\n\n1674\n01:39:49.620 --> 01:39:51.800\nWell, think of this like the Bash prompt,\nright.\n\n1675\n01:39:51.800 --> 01:39:54.510\nWhen we were in the Bash, that shell, we\n\n1676\n01:39:54.510 --> 01:39:59.670\nhad a series of commands that we could run\nthat were all standard Unix type commands.\n\n1677\n01:39:59.670 --> 01:40:06.050\nWell, on the database server, we're now at\na MySQL prompt, and we can now run SQL.\n\n1678\n01:40:06.050 --> 01:40:08.871\nWe can run the Standard Query Language\ncommands to do all sorts of things.\n\n1679\n01:40:08.871 --> 01:40:12.440\nAll right, so that's what CompTIA\nwants you to be familiar with.\n\n1680\n01:40:12.440 --> 01:40:16.040\nThey're some of the basic commands\navailable for us, all right?\n\n1681\n01:40:16.040 --> 01:40:18.790\nOne of the most important ones for\nme especially on a new server\n\n1682\n01:40:18.790 --> 01:40:23.232\nis simply the show databases command.\n\n1683\n01:40:23.232 --> 01:40:26.390\nAll right,\nnow I'm gonna type these in all capital.\n\n1684\n01:40:26.390 --> 01:40:27.610\nThey're actually not case sensitive.\n\n1685\n01:40:27.610 --> 01:40:29.050\nYou could type them all lower case.\n\n1686\n01:40:29.050 --> 01:40:33.360\nIt's not like the Linux and Unix command\nprompt where it's case sensitive.\n\n1687\n01:40:33.360 --> 01:40:35.180\nIn SQL it's not.\n\n1688\n01:40:35.180 --> 01:40:37.530\nI type these in capital,\nthough, just out of habit.\n\n1689\n01:40:37.530 --> 01:40:42.130\nIt's good practice so\nthat you can tell the difference between\n\n1690\n01:40:42.130 --> 01:40:46.200\nvariable words that you put in versus\ncommand words that are part of SQL.\n\n1691\n01:40:46.200 --> 01:40:47.350\nSo, I'm saying SHOW DATABASES.\n\n1692\n01:40:47.350 --> 01:40:50.640\nNow, whenever you type\na command inside of SQL,\n\n1693\n01:40:50.640 --> 01:40:53.420\nyou should stick a semicolon\nat the end of it.\n\n1694\n01:40:53.420 --> 01:40:56.505\nThat means, go ahead and\nexecute the command.\n\n1695\n01:40:56.505 --> 01:41:00.835\nif you don't include that, right, I'm\ngonna run SHOW DATABASES with a semicolon,\n\n1696\n01:41:00.835 --> 01:41:03.485\nand it's gonna run, and\nthere's my list of databases.\n\n1697\n01:41:03.485 --> 01:41:07.035\nI've got information_schema,\nmysql, and test.\n\n1698\n01:41:07.035 --> 01:41:09.720\nIf I had left that semicolon off.\n\n1699\n01:41:09.720 --> 01:41:12.260\nIt assumes that I still have more to do.\n\n1700\n01:41:12.260 --> 01:41:16.490\nAnd so now I can feed more commands to it,\nor more data to it, or whatever.\n\n1701\n01:41:16.490 --> 01:41:20.260\nIt doesn't know I'm done\nuntil I do a semicolon, okay?\n\n1702\n01:41:20.260 --> 01:41:21.600\nSo, the semicolon is important.\n\n1703\n01:41:21.600 --> 01:41:25.450\nThat's how it knows where\nyour command ends, all right?\n\n1704\n01:41:25.450 --> 01:41:28.240\nSo, here I can see my list of databases,\nso\n\n1705\n01:41:28.240 --> 01:41:31.740\njust SHOW DATABASES,\nwe can see which ones are there.\n\n1706\n01:41:31.740 --> 01:41:36.850\nI want to work with that test database so\nI'm gonna say, USE test.\n\n1707\n01:41:36.850 --> 01:41:39.460\nAnd see how I did the word\nuse in capitalized letters.\n\n1708\n01:41:39.460 --> 01:41:41.652\nAgain, I could've done it in\nlower case but this is so\n\n1709\n01:41:41.652 --> 01:41:43.228\nthat visually I know the difference.\n\n1710\n01:41:43.228 --> 01:41:47.146\nUse is a command word,\ntest is a variable word.\n\n1711\n01:41:47.146 --> 01:41:48.980\nI'm using test,\nthat's the name of the database.\n\n1712\n01:41:50.480 --> 01:41:52.910\nAll right, so it says database changed.\n\n1713\n01:41:52.910 --> 01:41:58.835\nNow every command I issue is going to be\nexecuted against the test database, right?\n\n1714\n01:41:58.835 --> 01:42:01.155\nI'm not gonna be messing with the other\ndatabases that are out there.\n\n1715\n01:42:02.935 --> 01:42:07.145\nAll right, when I'm connected to\nthe database, databases store tables,\n\n1716\n01:42:07.145 --> 01:42:08.105\ntables of data.\n\n1717\n01:42:08.105 --> 01:42:10.000\nAnd it's that data that we query against.\n\n1718\n01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:11.290\nI believe this one is empty.\n\n1719\n01:42:11.290 --> 01:42:14.510\nI can do SHOW TABLES to find out.\n\n1720\n01:42:14.510 --> 01:42:18.100\nSo I'll run SHOW TABLES and sure enough\nthere are no tables in this database.\n\n1721\n01:42:18.100 --> 01:42:21.540\nAll right, well if you want to work\nwith data you've gotta create tables.\n\n1722\n01:42:21.540 --> 01:42:24.280\nAnd if you ever work with\nspreadsheets in like Open Office or\n\n1723\n01:42:24.280 --> 01:42:27.600\nMicrosoft Excel or whatever,\nthat's all a table is a spreadsheet.\n\n1724\n01:42:27.600 --> 01:42:29.800\nYou've got rows and columns.\n\n1725\n01:42:29.800 --> 01:42:35.730\nEach column represents a certain value,\nand each row represents a separate entity.\n\n1726\n01:42:36.990 --> 01:42:38.810\nIt sounds a little confusing.\n\n1727\n01:42:38.810 --> 01:42:42.740\nLet me create one real quick so that you\nguys can see what I'm talking about.\n\n1728\n01:42:42.740 --> 01:42:46.350\nIf I want to create a table\nI can just say CREATE TABLE.\n\n1729\n01:42:46.350 --> 01:42:51.370\nAnd maybe I want to create a table\nstoring data about my employees.\n\n1730\n01:42:51.370 --> 01:42:53.900\nSo all the employees in the company\nI want to have in a table.\n\n1731\n01:42:53.900 --> 01:42:57.150\nSo I'm gonna create\na table called employees.\n\n1732\n01:42:57.150 --> 01:43:01.130\nAnd in that table I'm gonna\nhave a few columns and\n\n1733\n01:43:01.130 --> 01:43:05.280\neach column is gonna store a little\nbit of information about my users.\n\n1734\n01:43:05.280 --> 01:43:10.690\nOkay, I might want to say an id,\nI want to store their ID number, right.\n\n1735\n01:43:10.690 --> 01:43:14.480\nAnd their ID number, that is gonna be\na number, so I need to tell MySQL that\n\n1736\n01:43:14.480 --> 01:43:17.390\nthat's going to be an integer\nthat I'm storing in there, right.\n\n1737\n01:43:17.390 --> 01:43:19.110\nSo I'm storing a number.\n\n1738\n01:43:19.110 --> 01:43:27.110\nI might also want to store their first\nname and that's going to be text, right?\n\n1739\n01:43:27.110 --> 01:43:28.570\nSo I need to tell when\nit's gonna be text but\n\n1740\n01:43:28.570 --> 01:43:30.250\nit's not always the same\namount of characters, right?\n\n1741\n01:43:30.250 --> 01:43:31.330\nIt's a variable character,\n\n1742\n01:43:31.330 --> 01:43:34.150\nit could have as many as a certain\namount of numbers or letters.\n\n1743\n01:43:34.150 --> 01:43:38.410\nSo I just need to set a limit so\nI'm gonna say variable character 50.\n\n1744\n01:43:38.410 --> 01:43:43.620\nThat means that the first\nname column can store\n\n1745\n01:43:43.620 --> 01:43:46.430\nup to 50 characters for\nsomebody's first name.\n\n1746\n01:43:46.430 --> 01:43:48.083\nAnd I'll just do the same thing for\nlastname.\n\n1747\n01:43:48.083 --> 01:43:53.520\nSo we got lastname, and I'll just tell it\nthat that's a variable character 50 Also,\n\n1748\n01:43:53.520 --> 01:43:56.249\nand my screen's gonna wrap around here so.\n\n1749\n01:43:56.249 --> 01:43:59.238\nSo now I'm telling it that\nI'm gonna create this table,\n\n1750\n01:43:59.238 --> 01:44:02.105\nand it's going to be these\nthree columns right here and\n\n1751\n01:44:02.105 --> 01:44:06.790\nI need to close off my parentheses right\nthere at the end and throw in a semicolon.\n\n1752\n01:44:06.790 --> 01:44:10.700\nSo if I were to run this, it would\ncreate this table and there we go.\n\n1753\n01:44:10.700 --> 01:44:13.190\nBut we can actually go\na little more advanced.\n\n1754\n01:44:13.190 --> 01:44:18.420\nWe can take a column like that id column,\nand maybe I don't want to manually give\n\n1755\n01:44:18.420 --> 01:44:22.180\npeople an id number, maybe I want it to\nautomatically generate those id numbers.\n\n1756\n01:44:22.180 --> 01:44:26.150\nSo every time I add an employee,\nit just adds the next number in line.\n\n1757\n01:44:26.150 --> 01:44:28.580\nOkay, this gets a little bit advanced.\n\n1758\n01:44:28.580 --> 01:44:33.630\nBut basically what we can do\nis we can tell it NOT NULL,\n\n1759\n01:44:33.630 --> 01:44:34.920\nthat means it can't be empty.\n\n1760\n01:44:34.920 --> 01:44:38.337\nIt's gotta have a value in it or\nwe can't create the employee.\n\n1761\n01:44:38.337 --> 01:44:41.502\nAnd then I can say AUTO_INCREMENT.\n\n1762\n01:44:41.502 --> 01:44:45.169\nNow when I say AUTO_INCREMENT,\nthat means every time I add a new entity,\n\n1763\n01:44:45.169 --> 01:44:47.961\nit's going to go ahead and\njust bump to a higher number.\n\n1764\n01:44:47.961 --> 01:44:50.870\nAnd I want to make sure that\nI never have duplicates.\n\n1765\n01:44:50.870 --> 01:44:55.680\nSo I'm gonna add PRIMARY KEY, which is\ngonna tell it never to allow a duplicate.\n\n1766\n01:44:55.680 --> 01:44:56.940\nIt's always gonna move up.\n\n1767\n01:44:56.940 --> 01:44:59.270\nAnd it's never gonna reuse numbers.\n\n1768\n01:44:59.270 --> 01:45:01.640\nThose are a lot of options on one field.\n\n1769\n01:45:01.640 --> 01:45:03.490\nI'm gonna go ahead and leave first and\n\n1770\n01:45:03.490 --> 01:45:07.430\nlast name alone because I might have two\nemployees that are both John Smith, right?\n\n1771\n01:45:07.430 --> 01:45:09.870\nThat happens, but\nthey'll have different employee ids.\n\n1772\n01:45:09.870 --> 01:45:10.860\nThat's how I'll keep track of them.\n\n1773\n01:45:12.890 --> 01:45:16.350\nAll right, so I'm gonna run that and\nthat's gonna create that table.\n\n1774\n01:45:16.350 --> 01:45:20.020\nAnd so, now I've got a table in place.\n\n1775\n01:45:20.020 --> 01:45:21.260\nBut it's kind of empty.\n\n1776\n01:45:21.260 --> 01:45:23.410\nSo I need to put some data in there.\n\n1777\n01:45:23.410 --> 01:45:26.040\nI need to add my employees to the table.\n\n1778\n01:45:26.040 --> 01:45:30.010\nAnd the easiest way that we can do that\nis with what's called an insert command.\n\n1779\n01:45:30.010 --> 01:45:33.294\nAnd the insert command is how\nwe add data to the table.\n\n1780\n01:45:33.294 --> 01:45:36.647\nSo, I'll just come in here, and I'll say,\n\n1781\n01:45:36.647 --> 01:45:41.532\nINSERT INTO employees, so\nI'm inserting data into that table.\n\n1782\n01:45:41.532 --> 01:45:44.850\nAll right, and\nthen I need to tell it what I'm giving it.\n\n1783\n01:45:44.850 --> 01:45:51.808\nI'm going to give it first name and\nlast name for a person to add to it.\n\n1784\n01:45:51.808 --> 01:45:56.710\nAll right, and then I need to tell it\nthe values that I'm going enter in.\n\n1785\n01:45:56.710 --> 01:45:59.669\nAnd so I'll enter in Bob.\n\n1786\n01:46:02.627 --> 01:46:03.942\nSmith.\n\n1787\n01:46:03.942 --> 01:46:07.040\nIn Linux, I just do the clear command and\nit moves me to the top of the screen,\n\n1788\n01:46:07.040 --> 01:46:07.700\nit's kinda nice.\n\n1789\n01:46:07.700 --> 01:46:11.850\nBut in mysql, it doesn't let me do that,\nso my head gets in the way.\n\n1790\n01:46:11.850 --> 01:46:14.760\nSo here, I'm basically just saying hey,\ngo ahead and add Bob Smith.\n\n1791\n01:46:14.760 --> 01:46:18.000\nIt's gonna create a row in that table,\nand it'll have Bob as the first name,\n\n1792\n01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:20.510\nand Smith as the last name.\n\n1793\n01:46:20.510 --> 01:46:23.890\nAnd so that'll get him created,\nand throw him in there, right.\n\n1794\n01:46:23.890 --> 01:46:24.620\n>> There you go.\n\n1795\n01:46:24.620 --> 01:46:26.470\n>> And you can create more\nthan one user at a time.\n\n1796\n01:46:26.470 --> 01:46:27.970\nSo if I wanna create some other ones.\n\n1797\n01:46:27.970 --> 01:46:29.900\nI wanna go ahead and\ncreate just a few more.\n\n1798\n01:46:29.900 --> 01:46:31.490\nI can, you know what?\n\n1799\n01:46:31.490 --> 01:46:34.300\nI forgot something important, shoot.\n\n1800\n01:46:34.300 --> 01:46:36.186\nI wanted to add one more column to this.\n\n1801\n01:46:36.186 --> 01:46:37.830\nI wanted to do a department, so\n\n1802\n01:46:37.830 --> 01:46:39.890\nI could keep track of what\ndepartment they were in.\n\n1803\n01:46:39.890 --> 01:46:40.950\nSo I screwed up.\n\n1804\n01:46:40.950 --> 01:46:42.919\nSo I'm gonna drop that table that I made.\n\n1805\n01:46:42.919 --> 01:46:46.212\nSo I'm gonna DROP TABLE employees,\nthat basically just means delete it.\n\n1806\n01:46:46.212 --> 01:46:49.002\nSo I'm gonna delete that table,\nso there it goes.\n\n1807\n01:46:49.002 --> 01:46:53.426\nAnd then I'm gonna go back to where I\ncreated it and I'm just gonna add one more\n\n1808\n01:46:53.426 --> 01:46:57.800\ncolumn, which is going to be department,\nand that's gonna be an integer.\n\n1809\n01:46:57.800 --> 01:47:01.256\nI'm gonna track this as a number, so\nI have department 1, department 2,\n\n1810\n01:47:01.256 --> 01:47:02.502\ndepartment 3, and so on.\n\n1811\n01:47:04.836 --> 01:47:06.920\nAll right, there we go.\n\n1812\n01:47:06.920 --> 01:47:10.930\nSo now, when I go to add those employees,\nI'll need to add\n\n1813\n01:47:10.930 --> 01:47:15.670\ntheir department number along with\ntheir first name and last name, okay.\n\n1814\n01:47:15.670 --> 01:47:17.875\nSo Bob Smith is gonna work\nin department number 1.\n\n1815\n01:47:19.450 --> 01:47:21.140\nAnd what did I do?\n\n1816\n01:47:21.140 --> 01:47:22.610\nLet's see, forgot that.\n\n1817\n01:47:22.610 --> 01:47:23.502\n>> Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n1818\n01:47:25.211 --> 01:47:25.711\n>> There we go.\n\n1819\n01:47:25.711 --> 01:47:27.020\nI need to tell it that I'm giving it\n\n1820\n01:47:27.020 --> 01:47:28.210\nthe department, there.\n\n1821\n01:47:28.210 --> 01:47:30.060\nAll right, so now I've created Bob Smith.\n\n1822\n01:47:30.060 --> 01:47:31.820\nAnd then I can add my other employees,\ntoo, and\n\n1823\n01:47:31.820 --> 01:47:33.560\nI can add them all at\nthe same time if I want.\n\n1824\n01:47:33.560 --> 01:47:35.400\nSo that was Bob Smith.\n\n1825\n01:47:35.400 --> 01:47:37.502\nI might wanna add John Doe.\n\n1826\n01:47:42.627 --> 01:47:45.210\nHe'll be in department 2, right?\n\n1827\n01:47:45.210 --> 01:47:46.200\nAnd I forgot.\n\n1828\n01:47:46.200 --> 01:47:47.970\nI wanted to add more than\none at the same time.\n\n1829\n01:47:47.970 --> 01:47:50.900\nSo that was John Doe,\nmaybe I'll add who else?\n\n1830\n01:47:50.900 --> 01:47:51.680\nAlan Johnson.\n\n1831\n01:47:53.300 --> 01:47:54.530\nI'm not very creative with names.\n\n1832\n01:47:56.350 --> 01:47:58.560\nWho's going to be in department 1.\n\n1833\n01:47:58.560 --> 01:48:00.580\nAnd instead of doing a semicolon there,\n\n1834\n01:48:00.580 --> 01:48:04.040\nI'm going to do a comma to\nspecify another employee.\n\n1835\n01:48:04.040 --> 01:48:09.620\nAnd I'll do Alice Smith.\n\n1836\n01:48:12.720 --> 01:48:15.211\nAnd she's going to be in department 2.\n\n1837\n01:48:17.543 --> 01:48:18.940\nThere we go.\n\n1838\n01:48:18.940 --> 01:48:19.710\nAll right, so now,\n\n1839\n01:48:19.710 --> 01:48:22.290\nI'm adding two employees at the same time,\nAlan and Alice.\n\n1840\n01:48:22.290 --> 01:48:26.795\nLooks like we have some duplicates.\n\n1841\n01:48:30.301 --> 01:48:31.740\nNo, records 2, duplicates 0.\n\n1842\n01:48:31.740 --> 01:48:32.300\nWarnings 1.\n\n1843\n01:48:32.300 --> 01:48:33.400\nI did get a warning.\n\n1844\n01:48:33.400 --> 01:48:35.120\nWonder what happened there.\n\n1845\n01:48:35.120 --> 01:48:36.560\nWell, I got a warning\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1846\n01:48:36.560 --> 01:48:39.430\n>> So that means that it did what I asked\nit to, but it did give me a warning about\n\n1847\n01:48:39.430 --> 01:48:41.940\nsomething, and it wasn't happy\nabout something I just did.\n\n1848\n01:48:41.940 --> 01:48:44.580\nWell, I just stuck data into the table.\n\n1849\n01:48:44.580 --> 01:48:46.230\nI need to get data out.\n\n1850\n01:48:46.230 --> 01:48:49.710\nI get data out of the table by using\nprobably the most important command,\n\n1851\n01:48:49.710 --> 01:48:51.032\nthe select command.\n\n1852\n01:48:51.032 --> 01:48:53.293\nSelect is how we get\ndata out of the table.\n\n1853\n01:48:53.293 --> 01:49:00.252\nSo I'm just gonna run\nSELECT * FROM employees.\n\n1854\n01:49:00.252 --> 01:49:01.640\nNow let's take a look at this command.\n\n1855\n01:49:01.640 --> 01:49:03.753\nSELECT, that means I wanna get data.\n\n1856\n01:49:03.753 --> 01:49:06.711\n* that means I wanna get everything.\n\n1857\n01:49:06.711 --> 01:49:09.996\nFROM, I need to tell it where it's coming\nfrom, and I'm gonna say employees,\n\n1858\n01:49:09.996 --> 01:49:10.850\nthat's the table.\n\n1859\n01:49:10.850 --> 01:49:14.520\nGet all the data from the employees\ntable and show it to me.\n\n1860\n01:49:14.520 --> 01:49:18.300\nAnd I can see right here,\nI've got Bob, John, Alan, and Alice.\n\n1861\n01:49:18.300 --> 01:49:20.560\nThey've all got their departments,\nthey've all got their last names.\n\n1862\n01:49:20.560 --> 01:49:22.010\nThey're all in that table.\n\n1863\n01:49:22.010 --> 01:49:25.520\nSo, it gave me a warning, but\nI don't really see what the problem was.\n\n1864\n01:49:25.520 --> 01:49:31.840\nSo, it appears to have gotten over it, and\nnow I've got my data in the table, okay?\n\n1865\n01:49:31.840 --> 01:49:36.040\nThat SELECT *, I could change that and\nsay just SELECT firstname.\n\n1866\n01:49:36.040 --> 01:49:38.190\nI just want everybody's first name.\n\n1867\n01:49:38.190 --> 01:49:39.230\nDon't bother with the rest of it.\n\n1868\n01:49:39.230 --> 01:49:40.260\nAnd then there it goes.\n\n1869\n01:49:40.260 --> 01:49:41.490\nIt gives me the first name.\n\n1870\n01:49:41.490 --> 01:49:47.070\nBy saying *, you're saying give me all\nof the various columns, all right?\n\n1871\n01:49:47.070 --> 01:49:51.760\nSo that SELECT *, that part is really\nspecifying which columns you want.\n\n1872\n01:49:51.760 --> 01:49:56.140\nIf you wanna specify which row you want,\nyou need to use the WHERE command.\n\n1873\n01:49:56.140 --> 01:50:04.190\nSo I could say SELECT * FROM\nemployees WHERE department = '1'.\n\n1874\n01:50:04.190 --> 01:50:08.460\nOkay, so just give me the people\nwho work in department 1.\n\n1875\n01:50:08.460 --> 01:50:12.560\nAnd there we go,\nI get Bob Smith and Alan Johns.\n\n1876\n01:50:12.560 --> 01:50:13.360\nI guess that's my error.\n\n1877\n01:50:13.360 --> 01:50:18.350\nI must have done something\nwrong with Johnson, anyhow.\n\n1878\n01:50:18.350 --> 01:50:21.800\nDid I set like a variable\ncharacter five and\n\n1879\n01:50:21.800 --> 01:50:23.490\ncut it to five characters-\n>> It could be.\n\n1880\n01:50:23.490 --> 01:50:24.600\n>> I bet that's what I did.\n\n1881\n01:50:24.600 --> 01:50:29.090\nWhen I created that table,\nlet's go and find it, I did.\n\n1882\n01:50:29.090 --> 01:50:31.544\nLook at that,\nlastname variable character five.\n\n1883\n01:50:31.544 --> 01:50:34.754\nSo that warning that it was giving me,\nI gave it a value of Johnson which is\n\n1884\n01:50:34.754 --> 01:50:38.380\nmore than five characters and see, it\ntrimmed it to only store five characters.\n\n1885\n01:50:38.380 --> 01:50:39.420\nSo I made a mistake.\n\n1886\n01:50:39.420 --> 01:50:41.300\nBut, all right, either way.\n\n1887\n01:50:41.300 --> 01:50:45.450\nSo, now I've got my employees in\na table and I can query against them.\n\n1888\n01:50:45.450 --> 01:50:50.780\nI use the WHERE operator to be able to\nsay, just give me these specific people.\n\n1889\n01:50:50.780 --> 01:50:54.305\nI don't want everything, just give\nme people where department equals 1.\n\n1890\n01:50:56.260 --> 01:50:59.128\nAll right, some of the other things\nwe can do, we can do wild cards.\n\n1891\n01:50:59.128 --> 01:51:03.736\nWe can say WHERE last name is LIKE, and\n\n1892\n01:51:03.736 --> 01:51:09.365\nthen I can specify something like 'S%'..\n\n1893\n01:51:09.365 --> 01:51:16.770\nI'm basically saying, give me a list of\nemployees whose last name starts with S.\n\n1894\n01:51:16.770 --> 01:51:19.570\nI want people whose last\nnames starts with S.\n\n1895\n01:51:19.570 --> 01:51:21.660\nAnd it'll return to me,\noop, I forgot my semicolon,\n\n1896\n01:51:21.660 --> 01:51:24.020\neven after I told everybody\nto worry about that.\n\n1897\n01:51:24.020 --> 01:51:24.910\nThere we go.\nI can see,\n\n1898\n01:51:24.910 --> 01:51:28.610\nI have two employees who are Smith,\nand so, I got both of them back.\n\n1899\n01:51:28.610 --> 01:51:30.280\nI'm looking for people like S.\n\n1900\n01:51:30.280 --> 01:51:34.844\nI could have said where lastname =\n'Smith', right, and that would have\n\n1901\n01:51:34.844 --> 01:51:39.336\njust gotten the Smiths, so if I had\nsomebody whose last name was Sanders,\n\n1902\n01:51:39.336 --> 01:51:41.817\nit wouldn't have gotten them, right?\n\n1903\n01:51:41.817 --> 01:51:49.442\nBut when I say LIKE 'S%',\nwhich it's not gonna say it for me, is it?\n\n1904\n01:51:49.442 --> 01:51:52.834\nWHERE lastname LIKE 'S%'.\n\n1905\n01:51:52.834 --> 01:51:54.530\nThat % is the wildcard in SQL,\n\n1906\n01:51:54.530 --> 01:51:58.380\nit's just saying find people\nwhose last name starts with an S.\n\n1907\n01:51:58.380 --> 01:52:01.080\nOr you could, it's less efficient,\nbut you could do '%s',\n\n1908\n01:52:01.080 --> 01:52:05.310\nfind me people whose last name ends in s,\nso there I get Alan Johns.\n\n1909\n01:52:08.160 --> 01:52:10.330\nSo that WHERE command is pretty handy.\n\n1910\n01:52:10.330 --> 01:52:13.910\nYou can kinda filter people,\ndo all sorts of crazy things.\n\n1911\n01:52:13.910 --> 01:52:15.860\nYou can also sort.\n\n1912\n01:52:15.860 --> 01:52:25.100\nSo if I do SELECT * FROM employees, right?\n\n1913\n01:52:25.100 --> 01:52:27.560\nIt's ordered just in\nthe order they were created.\n\n1914\n01:52:27.560 --> 01:52:30.350\nBob was created first, then John,\nthen Alan, then Alice, right?\n\n1915\n01:52:30.350 --> 01:52:32.050\nSo it's kind of listing them that way.\n\n1916\n01:52:32.050 --> 01:52:39.680\nI might want to order that by last name,\nokay?\n\n1917\n01:52:39.680 --> 01:52:43.340\nSo, give me the data back, but\nsort it by that last name.\n\n1918\n01:52:43.340 --> 01:52:46.250\nAnd so there we go,\nnow it's alphabetized by that last name.\n\n1919\n01:52:50.977 --> 01:52:53.600\nOr, we could do, you know,\nfirst name, or whatever.\n\n1920\n01:52:53.600 --> 01:53:00.090\nYou can also specify ascending or\ndescending, so I can say descending, and\n\n1921\n01:53:00.090 --> 01:53:04.070\nwe run it that way, see how the highest\nletter comes first and then it goes down.\n\n1922\n01:53:04.070 --> 01:53:06.570\nAscending is the default ASC so,\n\n1923\n01:53:06.570 --> 01:53:10.620\nif I put ASC in there it's just\ngonna be what the default was.\n\n1924\n01:53:10.620 --> 01:53:15.517\nSo, again, more ways that we\ncan manipulate that data.\n\n1925\n01:53:15.517 --> 01:53:19.767\nAll right, let's say that I wanted to,\n\n1926\n01:53:19.767 --> 01:53:25.030\nlet's get fancy here okay,\nthese departments.\n\n1927\n01:53:25.030 --> 01:53:26.630\nI've got the departments\nlisted as a number.\n\n1928\n01:53:26.630 --> 01:53:27.880\nDepartment 1, department 2.\n\n1929\n01:53:27.880 --> 01:53:30.376\nWhat if I want to give\na name to these departments?\n\n1930\n01:53:30.376 --> 01:53:34.590\nWell, part of database optimization, and\n\n1931\n01:53:34.590 --> 01:53:37.670\nthis isn't a database exam, or whatever,\nso I don't wanna go crazy on it.\n\n1932\n01:53:37.670 --> 01:53:41.700\nBut one way of optimizing a database\nis to denormalize the data.\n\n1933\n01:53:41.700 --> 01:53:44.320\nAnd so you have data spread\nacross more than one table.\n\n1934\n01:53:44.320 --> 01:53:46.940\nSo I might have a separate\ntable somewhere else,\n\n1935\n01:53:46.940 --> 01:53:49.500\nthat says what name\nthese departments have.\n\n1936\n01:53:49.500 --> 01:53:51.200\nSo maybe I'll whip one\nof those up real quick.\n\n1937\n01:53:51.200 --> 01:53:55.725\nI'll say CREATE TABLE departments,\nall right.\n\n1938\n01:53:55.725 --> 01:53:57.415\nSo I'm gonna create\nthis departments table.\n\n1939\n01:53:57.415 --> 01:54:00.295\nAnd it's just gonna store a name.\n\n1940\n01:54:00.295 --> 01:54:02.015\nNo, it's gotta have a name and an id.\n\n1941\n01:54:02.015 --> 01:54:07.137\nSo I'll do an id and a name, which will be\n\n1942\n01:54:07.137 --> 01:54:13.476\na variable character\n[LAUGH] 50 this time not 5.\n\n1943\n01:54:13.476 --> 01:54:14.800\nAnd then that should\nprobably be enough for me.\n\n1944\n01:54:14.800 --> 01:54:16.160\nDo I need anything else?\n\n1945\n01:54:16.160 --> 01:54:22.120\nLet's see, yeah, for\nthat id I could do that auto increment and\n\n1946\n01:54:22.120 --> 01:54:23.670\nhint all that stuff but\nI'm just gonna leave it off.\n\n1947\n01:54:23.670 --> 01:54:27.830\nI'll just do a straight up id and\nhave that one.\n\n1948\n01:54:27.830 --> 01:54:32.683\nAnd then I can INSERT INTO departments.\n\n1949\n01:54:36.143 --> 01:54:40.780\nAnd I'll need to insert id and name,\n\n1950\n01:54:40.780 --> 01:54:45.716\nVALUES and then I'm gonna specify, so\n\n1951\n01:54:45.716 --> 01:54:52.309\ndepartment 1 is going to be Marketing,\nall right.\n\n1952\n01:54:52.309 --> 01:55:00.350\nAnd department 2 is going to be Sales,\nall right.\n\n1953\n01:55:00.350 --> 01:55:03.870\nSo when I head and created those, so\nnow I've got department 1 is Marketing,\n\n1954\n01:55:03.870 --> 01:55:10.350\ndepartment 2 is Sales and if I say,\nselect * from departments.\n\n1955\n01:55:10.350 --> 01:55:13.270\nI can see right there\ndepartment id 1 is marketing.\n\n1956\n01:55:13.270 --> 01:55:15.100\nDepartment id 2 is sales.\n\n1957\n01:55:15.100 --> 01:55:17.120\nSo, now I have got two tables right?\n\n1958\n01:55:17.120 --> 01:55:20.730\nOne with employees right there.\n\n1959\n01:55:20.730 --> 01:55:23.832\nAnd it's got there department they work\nin and one with the department and\n\n1960\n01:55:23.832 --> 01:55:25.350\nwhat their id number is.\n\n1961\n01:55:25.350 --> 01:55:30.704\nAnd I can match these together to find\nout that Bob Smith works in marketing or\n\n1962\n01:55:30.704 --> 01:55:33.309\nthat John Doe works in sales, okay.\n\n1963\n01:55:33.309 --> 01:55:36.260\nMy only problem here is\nthey're two separate tables.\n\n1964\n01:55:36.260 --> 01:55:38.770\nSo this is where things\nget really powerful.\n\n1965\n01:55:38.770 --> 01:55:43.988\nIs we can build a result set that's\nbased on data from more than one table,\n\n1966\n01:55:43.988 --> 01:55:45.209\nall right.\n\n1967\n01:55:45.209 --> 01:55:47.750\nNow, I said I don't wanna get too complex.\n\n1968\n01:55:47.750 --> 01:55:51.310\nReally the select statements and stuff,\nthat basic function that's what we want\n\n1969\n01:55:51.310 --> 01:55:54.630\nbut on the exam objectives\nthey list the JOIN command and\n\n1970\n01:55:54.630 --> 01:55:56.450\nthis is where the JOIN command comes in.\n\n1971\n01:55:56.450 --> 01:55:58.800\nWe can join data from\ntwo different tables.\n\n1972\n01:55:58.800 --> 01:56:01.810\nSo I wanted to create\na real simple example so\n\n1973\n01:56:01.810 --> 01:56:06.550\nthat we don't blow our minds trying to\nlearn the database query language, right.\n\n1974\n01:56:06.550 --> 01:56:11.613\nSo what I can do is I can write a cool\nstatement in here, I could say select,\n\n1975\n01:56:11.613 --> 01:56:16.108\nlet me get back to proper syntax here,\nSELECT * FROM employees,\n\n1976\n01:56:16.108 --> 01:56:19.970\nactually I need to get\na little bit more detailed.\n\n1977\n01:56:19.970 --> 01:56:25.566\nI wanna select firstname\nfrom the employees table so\n\n1978\n01:56:25.566 --> 01:56:32.448\nI need to say employees.firstname and\nemployees.lastname.\n\n1979\n01:56:32.448 --> 01:56:36.850\nNotice how I'm specifying the table name,\nI didn't do that before, but\n\n1980\n01:56:36.850 --> 01:56:39.430\nbefore I was only pulling from one table.\n\n1981\n01:56:39.430 --> 01:56:41.280\nNow I'm pulling from more than one table.\n\n1982\n01:56:41.280 --> 01:56:46.540\nSo I have to say, employees.firstname,\nemployees.lastname, and\n\n1983\n01:56:46.540 --> 01:56:51.820\ndepartment, or was it departments,\ndepartments.name, right?\n\n1984\n01:56:51.820 --> 01:56:54.660\nSo now I'm pulling that\nfrom a second table.\n\n1985\n01:56:55.840 --> 01:56:58.110\nAnd I'm gonna say, FROM employees.\n\n1986\n01:56:58.110 --> 01:57:00.130\nNow, we know that's not entirely true.\n\n1987\n01:57:00.130 --> 01:57:04.017\nCuz this isn't all coming from\nthe employees table, all right.\n\n1988\n01:57:04.017 --> 01:57:07.870\nSo I'm gonna say that I'm pulling\nit from the employees table, and\n\n1989\n01:57:07.870 --> 01:57:11.601\nthen I need to tell it how to sort\nthat out, how to make sense of it.\n\n1990\n01:57:11.601 --> 01:57:16.103\nAnd so\nwhat I'm gonna do is I'm go ahead and\n\n1991\n01:57:16.103 --> 01:57:20.982\nhit enter here, and\nI didn't do a semicolon,\n\n1992\n01:57:20.982 --> 01:57:26.236\nI'm hitting enter to kind\nof clean up the screen,\n\n1993\n01:57:26.236 --> 01:57:30.489\nand I'm gonna say, JOIN departments ON\n\n1994\n01:57:30.489 --> 01:57:36.780\nemployees.department=departments.id, all\nright.\n\n1995\n01:57:36.780 --> 01:57:38.020\nSee what I'm doing there?\n\n1996\n01:57:38.020 --> 01:57:44.790\nDepartment in the employees table matches\nup to id in the department table.\n\n1997\n01:57:44.790 --> 01:57:48.640\nSo the employees table and the department\ntable have that common entity.\n\n1998\n01:57:48.640 --> 01:57:51.670\nIt's just called department here and\nit's called id over here.\n\n1999\n01:57:51.670 --> 01:57:53.240\nSo, that's what I'm doing\nin this JOIN statement.\n\n2000\n01:57:53.240 --> 01:57:58.320\nAs I'm saying,\nemployees.department=departments.id.\n\n2001\n01:57:58.320 --> 01:57:59.750\nThat's how I can match it up.\n\n2002\n01:57:59.750 --> 01:58:03.960\nNow, my system understand what\nthe heck it is I'm talking about.\n\n2003\n01:58:03.960 --> 01:58:09.840\nAnd so, it'll be able to pull the first\nname and last name from employees.\n\n2004\n01:58:09.840 --> 01:58:13.080\nIt'll be able to pull the department\nname from the department table, and\n\n2005\n01:58:13.080 --> 01:58:17.200\nthen it'll be able to combine them\ninto something that makes sense.\n\n2006\n01:58:17.200 --> 01:58:19.610\nThat's what the JOIN command does.\n\n2007\n01:58:19.610 --> 01:58:25.010\nAnd now I can see Bob Smith works in\nMarketing, not Bob Smith works in 1.\n\n2008\n01:58:25.010 --> 01:58:29.060\nAnd John Doe Doe works in sales\nnot John Doe works in 2, okay?\n\n2009\n01:58:29.060 --> 01:58:30.340\nI've combined that data.\n\n2010\n01:58:30.340 --> 01:58:32.170\nThat's what JOIN does, okay.\n\n2011\n01:58:32.170 --> 01:58:36.020\nThat JOIN right there is probably\nthe simplest of the JOIN statements.\n\n2012\n01:58:36.020 --> 01:58:39.620\nIf any of you go on to study SQL\nyou'll learn about inner JOINS and\n\n2013\n01:58:39.620 --> 01:58:43.460\nouter JOINS and all sorts of other\ncrazy ones that are out there.\n\n2014\n01:58:43.460 --> 01:58:45.530\nBut that's a real basic\nexample right there.\n\n2015\n01:58:45.530 --> 01:58:47.960\nJust combining data from\ntwo different tables, and\n\n2016\n01:58:47.960 --> 01:58:52.000\nsticking them together, all right.\n\n2017\n01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:55.890\nThe last one that I really think\nwe need to talk about is, like,\n\n2018\n01:58:55.890 --> 01:58:58.590\ndoing an update if we\nwanna change somebody.\n\n2019\n01:58:58.590 --> 01:59:03.810\nSo John Doe right now,\nJohn works in the sales department.\n\n2020\n01:59:03.810 --> 01:59:07.150\nAnd maybe he gets a transfer, and\nnow he needs to work in marketing.\n\n2021\n01:59:07.150 --> 01:59:09.230\nSo I wanna reach out and change him so\n\n2022\n01:59:09.230 --> 01:59:14.410\nhe doesn't work in department 2 anymore,\nnow he works in department 1, okay.\n\n2023\n01:59:14.410 --> 01:59:15.900\nSo for that I do an update.\n\n2024\n01:59:15.900 --> 01:59:20.080\nAnd what we do is we say UPDATE and\nthe table we're updating, so employees.\n\n2025\n01:59:21.680 --> 01:59:27.391\nAnd then we just say SET department = '1'.\n\n2026\n01:59:27.391 --> 01:59:31.845\nNow his department equals 2 right now,\nso I'm going to say SET department = '1'\n\n2027\n01:59:31.845 --> 01:59:36.426\nWHERE, if I don't do the where it's going\nto change everybody to have department 1,\n\n2028\n01:59:36.426 --> 01:59:37.467\nthat would be bad.\n\n2029\n01:59:37.467 --> 01:59:41.245\nSo I need to say WHERE id= and\n\n2030\n01:59:41.245 --> 01:59:45.500\nthen John's id and his id is 2.\n\n2031\n01:59:45.500 --> 01:59:49.489\nSo, it's gonna look in that table,\nwhich I've still got on screen up here, so\n\n2032\n01:59:49.489 --> 01:59:53.656\nit's gonna look in this table, it's gonna\nfind id number 2, which is John Doe and\n\n2033\n01:59:53.656 --> 01:59:56.000\nthen it's gonna change\nhis department to 1.\n\n2034\n01:59:56.000 --> 01:59:58.880\nAll right that's how we update a record.\n\n2035\n01:59:58.880 --> 02:00:02.470\nIt updates and\nnow if I rerun that big join,\n\n2036\n02:00:02.470 --> 02:00:07.160\nI can see that John Doe is now in the\nmarketing department instead of in sales.\n\n2037\n02:00:07.160 --> 02:00:11.020\nAll right, so we can quickly update\nrecords based on criteria and\n\n2038\n02:00:11.020 --> 02:00:11.770\nstuff like that.\n\n2039\n02:00:11.770 --> 02:00:17.120\nAll right, now that is a lot of commands\nto be thrown at you and if this is\n\n2040\n02:00:17.120 --> 02:00:24.030\nthe first time you've seen SQL databases\nthen that is a It definitely a mouthful.\n\n2041\n02:00:24.030 --> 02:00:27.450\nI will post my episode\nnotes with the show and\n\n2042\n02:00:27.450 --> 02:00:30.050\nI've got everyone of those commands\nthat I just did right here.\n\n2043\n02:00:30.050 --> 02:00:34.120\nSo you can recreate it on your own\nfrom installing mysql to actually\n\n2044\n02:00:34.120 --> 02:00:37.120\ndoing the tables and the queries.\n\n2045\n02:00:37.120 --> 02:00:41.400\nBut they're fairly straightforward once\nyou learn the syntax, select star.\n\n2046\n02:00:41.400 --> 02:00:44.530\nGive me everything from a table name,\nright?\n\n2047\n02:00:44.530 --> 02:00:47.090\nWhere this column equals this value.\n\n2048\n02:00:47.090 --> 02:00:48.500\nSo it does make sense.\n\n2049\n02:00:48.500 --> 02:00:53.190\nIt's kind of almost written in English,\npractically, right?\n\n2050\n02:00:53.190 --> 02:00:55.630\nBut knowing that syntax is important.\n\n2051\n02:00:55.630 --> 02:01:00.020\nAnd on the exam they do expect you\nto have a basic understanding of SQL\n\n2052\n02:01:00.020 --> 02:01:02.960\nwhich includes each of the commands\nthat I just showed you.\n\n2053\n02:01:02.960 --> 02:01:06.280\nSo I covered every one that they\nlist on the objectives there.\n\n2054\n02:01:06.280 --> 02:01:08.910\nBut it can be challenging\npractice around with it.\n\n2055\n02:01:08.910 --> 02:01:11.220\nExperiment, modify the commands.\n\n2056\n02:01:11.220 --> 02:01:12.940\nSee what difference you to get there.\n\n2057\n02:01:12.940 --> 02:01:14.670\nNow, one of the word to caution,\n\n2058\n02:01:14.670 --> 02:01:20.060\nI use MySQL client right here\ninside of the Linux command line.\n\n2059\n02:01:20.060 --> 02:01:23.970\nAnd every command that I ran\nwas syntactically correct.\n\n2060\n02:01:25.840 --> 02:01:31.150\nBut, if you use web base\ninterface like php, myadmin,\n\n2061\n02:01:31.150 --> 02:01:36.110\nor something like that the utilities\noften muck around with the input, and\n\n2062\n02:01:36.110 --> 02:01:40.330\nso you might have to add, instead\nof an apostrophe, like I was using,\n\n2063\n02:01:40.330 --> 02:01:42.140\nyou might have to do a back tick.\n\n2064\n02:01:42.140 --> 02:01:44.050\n>> There might be other things\nthat are slightly different\n\n2065\n02:01:44.050 --> 02:01:46.895\non those web interfaces, so\nbe careful with web interfaces.\n\n2066\n02:01:46.895 --> 02:01:47.970\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> They're not bad.\n\n2067\n02:01:47.970 --> 02:01:48.760\nI use them myself.\n\n2068\n02:01:48.760 --> 02:01:51.110\nI use PHP in my admin all the time but\n\n2069\n02:01:51.110 --> 02:01:53.100\njust understand they're\na little different.\n\n2070\n02:01:53.100 --> 02:01:57.160\nFrom the command line you get the actual\nnative commands, and things work out.\n\n2071\n02:01:57.160 --> 02:02:01.948\nSo for example when I did update\nemployees, employees referred to a table.\n\n2072\n02:02:01.948 --> 02:02:04.560\nIn php Admin you've always\ngotta put back ticks around it,\n\n2073\n02:02:04.560 --> 02:02:06.070\neven if there's no spaces.\n\n2074\n02:02:06.070 --> 02:02:09.690\nBut in the command line I don't, so,\njust be aware of using of a webinar phase.\n\n2075\n02:02:09.690 --> 02:02:11.030\nThe commands might be\na little bit different.\n\n2076\n02:02:12.400 --> 02:02:13.220\nAll right.\nOn the exam,\n\n2077\n02:02:13.220 --> 02:02:15.130\nthey'll show you\nthe native commands these.\n\n2078\n02:02:15.130 --> 02:02:18.000\nSo, these are the ones\nyou need to be aware of.\n\n2079\n02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:20.180\nAll right.\nSo, I think that pretty much wraps up my\n\n2080\n02:02:20.180 --> 02:02:21.030\nSQL.\n\n2081\n02:02:21.030 --> 02:02:24.150\nAgain, we didn't spend\na ton of time on it because\n\n2082\n02:02:24.150 --> 02:02:25.640\nthere's not a ton of it on the exam.\n\n2083\n02:02:25.640 --> 02:02:27.420\nBut it is there, it's an objective.\n\n2084\n02:02:27.420 --> 02:02:29.690\nYou need to be familiar with\nit in that way you are ready.\n\n2085\n02:02:31.200 --> 02:02:33.620\nWell, Ronnie, that's probably\na pretty good spot to wrap up.\n\n2086\n02:02:33.620 --> 02:02:34.830\nCan you think of anything else?\n\n2087\n02:02:34.830 --> 02:02:36.870\n>> I don't think so, yeah.\n\n2088\n02:02:36.870 --> 02:02:37.900\nWell

00:00:38.380\nwelcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:39.990\nI'm your host Don Pezet.\n\n5\n00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:41.050\nToday, Mr. Nate Copeland.\n\n6\n00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:41.950\nHow's it going, Nate?\n\n7\n00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:43.670\n>> Pretty good Don, pretty good.\n\n8\n00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.479\n>> We got another exciting\nLinux Plus episode ahead of us, and\n\n9\n00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:50.087\nthis is actually an episode I know some\nof our viewers have been waiting for.\n\n10\n00:00:50.087 --> 00:00:54.675\nBecause we're gonna drift away from\nthe command line interface and\n\n11\n00:00:54.675 --> 00:00:59.190\ndabble briefly in the world\nof graphical user interfaces.\n\n12\n00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.462\n>> Yeah, so I took this opportunity\nto jump in, fill in for Ronnie.\n\n13\n00:01:04.462 --> 00:01:08.100\nAnd some of the command line stuff,\nI do like it.\n\n14\n00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.603\nUsing command line stuff it makes\nme feel like a smart computer user.\n\n15\n00:01:11.603 --> 00:01:12.830\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Like back in the day when\n\n16\n00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.880\neverything is done on the keyboard,\nbut after, you can only look at so\n\n17\n00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.030\nmany lines and\nclick on things and type stuff.\n\n18\n00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:24.190\nBut to get into the GUI, it's,\nfinally get to use a mouse, so.\n\n19\n00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:28.980\n>> Yeah, and for our Mac users out there,\n\n20\n00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:34.120\nand for our newer, younger people just\ncoming out of high school right now,\n\n21\n00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.280\na graphic user interface is what you know.\n\n22\n00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:37.790\nIt's what you grew up with, right?\n\n23\n00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.350\nAnd so it's what you're used to,\nand it is a lot more intuitive.\n\n24\n00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.060\nThe command line gives\nus a lot more power.\n\n25\n00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.240\nAnd for those of us who have been in\nthe computer industry a lot longer,\n\n26\n00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:51.420\nthe old days, we didn't have mice,\nwe didn't have GUI's, we had command line.\n\n27\n00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.250\nSo for people like me,\n\n28\n00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.220\nI find myself dropping to command\nline as often as I am in the GUI.\n\n29\n00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:57.460\nIt's kind of split.\n\n30\n00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.030\nWell, you've seen me work Nate, you know\nhalf the time I'm just in a text editor.\n\n31\n00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.712\nI don't even like to use Word or whatever.\n\n32\n00:02:04.712 --> 00:02:08.260\nSo these are the, I'm just that guy,\nI just won't let go.\n\n33\n00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:11.740\nBut, so, for some of you guys,\nI don't know, I know, not all of you,\n\n34\n00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:14.118\nnot even most of you, but\nthere's at least one or\n\n35\n00:02:14.118 --> 00:02:18.130\ntwo of you that are out there going man,\nI though Linux+ was gonna be a lot easier.\n\n36\n00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:22.150\nBecause I've been running Ubuntu and\nI just drag these folders and\n\n37\n00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.040\nI've got my little wizards and stuff.\n\n38\n00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.080\nAnd that's true,\nthat's exactly how that's supposed to be.\n\n39\n00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.760\nThe desktop experience,\n\n40\n00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.390\nwhat you're experiencing with the GUI,\nthat's what's designed for end users.\n\n41\n00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.330\nFor people who don't need\na steep learning curve,\n\n42\n00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:40.110\nwho don't need a power experience, and\nso you get it a lot more simplified.\n\n43\n00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.070\nAnd for day to day use,\nby all means, do that.\n\n44\n00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:43.680\nIt's not a bad thing, right?\n\n45\n00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.230\nBut on a server, where you're\nconcerned about power and efficiency,\n\n46\n00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:48.309\ngetting things done fast.\n\n47\n00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:50.988\nAnd not just getting one thing done, but\n\n48\n00:02:50.988 --> 00:02:54.087\ngetting of hundreds of things done at the\nsame time, you don't have time for a GUI.\n\n49\n00:02:54.087 --> 00:02:57.713\nYou don't have the resources available\nto waste on rendering pretty\n\n50\n00:02:57.713 --> 00:03:01.715\nbuttons on the screen when your server\nprobably doesn't even have a monitor\n\n51\n00:03:01.715 --> 00:03:03.046\nattached to it, right?\n\n52\n00:03:03.046 --> 00:03:05.039\nI think it was in some episode,\n\n53\n00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:09.270\nwe brought up a picture of one of\nthe Google data centers, right?\n\n54\n00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:12.170\nLet me see if I can find one real quick.\n\n55\n00:03:14.087 --> 00:03:16.480\nLet's go to images.google.com.\n\n56\n00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.250\nSo Google has these data centers and they\nrun their own special version of Linux,\n\n57\n00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:22.980\nthey won't tell anybody what it is.\n\n58\n00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.094\nBut, hm?\n\n59\n00:03:24.094 --> 00:03:24.930\n>> Right?\n\n60\n00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.610\n>> Yeah, they, so-\n>> I guess I wasn't\n\n61\n00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:30.470\nlistening on that episode.\n\n62\n00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.270\n>> Yeah, I don't remember what,\nit might've been in my head.\n\n63\n00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:36.171\nSometimes these things happen in my head,\nand I think they happened in real life.\n\n64\n00:03:36.171 --> 00:03:40.576\nBut Google, they created a special\ninternal version of Linux that they run,\n\n65\n00:03:40.576 --> 00:03:43.353\nand they use,\nnot on their Chromebooks, but for\n\n66\n00:03:43.353 --> 00:03:46.710\ntheir internal employees it's this deep,\ndark secret.\n\n67\n00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:49.760\nAnd they don't want to tell people about\nit, because the more people know about it,\n\n68\n00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.498\nthe harder it becomes to secure.\n\n69\n00:03:51.498 --> 00:03:55.543\nBut yeah, so\nthey have a bunch of servers that\n\n70\n00:03:55.543 --> 00:03:59.171\nare especially designed just for them.\n\n71\n00:03:59.171 --> 00:04:03.501\nAnd you can kind of see them right here\nthis is what a Google data center looks\n\n72\n00:04:03.501 --> 00:04:05.504\nlike and, can I make that bigger?\n\n73\n00:04:05.504 --> 00:04:07.130\nI don't want to see pretty lights.\n\n74\n00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:08.860\nA lot of people want to see pretty lights,\n\n75\n00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:11.530\nand you see he's kind of\nlike making it himself.\n\n76\n00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:15.691\nBut basically they have these custom\nmade servers that are just rack upon\n\n77\n00:04:15.691 --> 00:04:20.003\nrack upon rack of these servers with\nno monitor, no keyboard, whatever.\n\n78\n00:04:20.003 --> 00:04:23.304\nThey just boot right up they go right\ninto handling their search indexing and\n\n79\n00:04:23.304 --> 00:04:24.730\nall that good stuff.\n\n80\n00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:30.000\nSo that kind of a thing,\nyou don't need a GUI for that.\n\n81\n00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.780\nYou can save a lot of memory.\n\n82\n00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:35.750\nYou can save a lot of disk I/O by\njust abandoning the GUI altogether.\n\n83\n00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:37.504\nThat's something that Google understands.\n\n84\n00:04:37.504 --> 00:04:40.480\nThat's something that every\nLinux distro understands.\n\n85\n00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:44.090\nThat's something that Novell\nunderstood with NetWare.\n\n86\n00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:47.330\nIt's something that Microsoft\nis learning with Windows,\n\n87\n00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:50.490\nright, cuz now they're starting to do\nthe core server installs and stuff.\n\n88\n00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:52.520\nBut it's something we've had in\nthe Linux world since the beginning.\n\n89\n00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:56.900\nSo, it's something we can take\nadvantage of is just going CLI only.\n\n90\n00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:00.212\nBut, on a desktop we\nprobably want that GUI.\n\n91\n00:05:00.212 --> 00:05:02.500\nSo that's what we're gonna\ntake a look at today.\n\n92\n00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:06.300\nNow, Linux is all about choice.\n\n93\n00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:11.050\nYou can pick from a wide variety\nof graphical user interfaces.\n\n94\n00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:14.685\nWhen we installed CentOS back\nin episode number two, I think,\n\n95\n00:05:14.685 --> 00:05:18.630\n[LAUGH] I'm pretty sure it was episode\ntwo, we choose to do, or at least\n\n96\n00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:22.880\nI choose to do a basic install, which did\nnot include a graphical user interface.\n\n97\n00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:27.770\nAnd that's my machine right here that\nwe've been working with all show, so\n\n98\n00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:31.050\nI've been just going through here and\nworking, running commands.\n\n99\n00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:33.080\nIt's been exciting, right?\n\n100\n00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:35.930\nHad I chosen to do a desktop install,\n\n101\n00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:38.960\nthough, with the graphical user interface,\nwhen I boot it up,\n\n102\n00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:44.710\nI would have been greeted with a screen\nsomething like this, all right.\n\n103\n00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:47.870\nThis is the default desktop for CentOS.\n\n104\n00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:50.010\nIt's a graphical user interface, and\n\n105\n00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:53.720\nit's being rendered by a window\nmanager that's called GNOME.\n\n106\n00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:56.240\nGNOME is G-N-O-M-E.\n\n107\n00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:00.610\nIt is a open source,\nfreely available window manager.\n\n108\n00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:03.450\nAnd CentOS is not the only one to use it,\nright, CentOS and\n\n109\n00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:05.240\nRed Hat because they're linked together.\n\n110\n00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:08.770\nBut you also see like\nSolaris use GNOME for\n\n111\n00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:11.790\na long time, which, I don't even\nknow if Solaris is still around.\n\n112\n00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:15.760\nBut you'll see where FreeBSD\nhas support for GNOME.\n\n113\n00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:19.720\nLots of operating systems support\nthe GNOME window manager.\n\n114\n00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:24.710\nAnd so it starts to create this common\nGUI, even across the different distros,\n\n115\n00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:25.860\nand that's pretty nice.\n\n116\n00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:31.020\nBecause you might have Fedora running\nGNOME, or RHEL running GNOME,\n\n117\n00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:32.650\nor Debian running GNOME.\n\n118\n00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:34.690\nAnd all three of them look kinda the same.\n\n119\n00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:38.180\nSo you're at home regardless\nof which one you're on.\n\n120\n00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:40.210\nAnd it's arranged in a pretty\nstraightforward way.\n\n121\n00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:43.020\nIf you wanna browse to your home folder,\nhere it is and\n\n122\n00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:47.870\nI get a nice little graphical view of my\nhome folder and now I've got Documents and\n\n123\n00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:50.050\nDownloads, Pictures,\nand that kind of stuff.\n\n124\n00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:55.140\nI don't see .bashrc or\n.profile or whatever.\n\n125\n00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:57.250\nThey're there,\nI just don't see them, right.\n\n126\n00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:01.872\nThat stuff is kind of hidden away, and\nif I turn on my hidden files, I can go in\n\n127\n00:07:01.872 --> 00:07:07.171\nhere and like there's my .cache and here's\nmy .bashrc and stuff, they're there.\n\n128\n00:07:07.171 --> 00:07:11.285\nThey're just hidden away because your\naverage desktop user doesn't need to\n\n129\n00:07:11.285 --> 00:07:12.820\ndeal with that.\n\n130\n00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:15.620\nOkay, and\nwe've got nice little menus up here.\n\n131\n00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:18.410\nSo our applications are tucked away,\nwe can go in here and\n\n132\n00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:22.620\nbrowse the web with Firefox or if you\ninstalled Debian, then it's Iceweasel.\n\n133\n00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:24.550\nHave you heard about that whole thing?\n\n134\n00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:26.720\n>> No, I think you brought it up once or\ntwice.\n\n135\n00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:28.679\nBut once again, I don't think\nI was paying attention to it.\n\n136\n00:07:28.679 --> 00:07:31.420\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Par for the course when I talk?\n\n137\n00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:36.015\n>> So there was this big fight\nbetween the Mozilla developers and\n\n138\n00:07:36.015 --> 00:07:37.879\nthe Debian developers.\n\n139\n00:07:37.879 --> 00:07:42.679\nAnd At the end of the day the Debian guys\nfelt like the Mozilla developers were\n\n140\n00:07:42.679 --> 00:07:46.510\nbeing a little bit untrusting,\nor not acting in good faith.\n\n141\n00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:50.697\nAnd so Firefox on Debian,\nthey've changed the logo to be blue and\n\n142\n00:07:50.697 --> 00:07:53.170\nthey call it Iceweasel instead.\n\n143\n00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:54.576\nOr at least they were doing that for\nseveral versions.\n\n144\n00:07:54.576 --> 00:07:57.053\nI haven't checked the latest one to\nsee if they're still doing it but\n\n145\n00:07:57.053 --> 00:07:58.560\nthey were doing it for several versions.\n\n146\n00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:00.040\nVery funny.\n\n147\n00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:00.800\n>> Very funny.\n\n148\n00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:04.350\n>> Sometimes I'm laughing on the inside.\n\n149\n00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:06.050\nBut you'll see all this stuff here.\n\n150\n00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:07.750\nNice easy to use menus.\n\n151\n00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:09.360\nYou can jump to your folders.\n\n152\n00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:11.310\nIf you want to shut down\nyou go to system and\n\n153\n00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:13.510\nshut down we don't have to\ndo a crazy command line.\n\n154\n00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:19.090\nWe don't worry about run levels and inits,\nit's all nice right here in our GUI,\n\n155\n00:08:19.090 --> 00:08:22.100\nand if we want to add more software\nI don't have to think about.\n\n156\n00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:25.645\nYum or anything like that,\nI can just go to Administration and\n\n157\n00:08:25.645 --> 00:08:29.600\nAdd/Remove Software, and\nI can find what I want to add.\n\n158\n00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:33.870\nSo if I wanna add some kind of\nproject management software,\n\n159\n00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:37.580\nI can find and let's see where is project.\n\n160\n00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:40.230\nIt's buried in here somewhere.\n\n161\n00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:43.160\nThe search didn't really narrow\nthings down for me did it.\n\n162\n00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:46.390\nSomewhere in here there's\nlike a web not a web base,\n\n163\n00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:49.510\nbut a graphical user interface\nproject management software.\n\n164\n00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:50.150\nAll right.\n\n165\n00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:51.472\nWell apparently I'm not gonna find it.\n\n166\n00:08:51.472 --> 00:08:54.980\nBut [LAUGH] it's in there\nsomewhere dadgummit.\n\n167\n00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:56.500\nAnd so you can go through,\n\n168\n00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:59.360\nyou can find all sorts of stuff\nbased on what your needs are.\n\n169\n00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:02.440\nThere's LibreOffice if\nI want a Office suite.\n\n170\n00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:05.230\nI think Open Office might\nalready be installed\n\n171\n00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:07.250\nthere's a project management tool.\n\n172\n00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:11.860\nTask juggler, or here I can do planner,\nplanner's a little smaller.\n\n173\n00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:13.530\nSo I can just check that off and apply it.\n\n174\n00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:15.350\nNow it's gonna install planner.\n\n175\n00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:16.840\nI'm not logged in as root,\n\n176\n00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:20.720\nI'm logged in as a regular user which is\ngood practice and so it's asking me for my\n\n177\n00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:25.930\nroot password because the root user is who\nhas permission to install the packages.\n\n178\n00:09:25.930 --> 00:09:30.060\nAnd so here it goes, it's gonna\ninstall it again not having to worry\n\n179\n00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:33.940\nabout repositories and stuff like that,\nit's sorting it all out for me.\n\n180\n00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:36.660\nThat's the advantage of\na graphical user interface.\n\n181\n00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:42.400\nAnd also in this graphical user\ninterface under applications, is it?\n\n182\n00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:46.550\nThere's a you still get down\nto the terminal correct?\n\n183\n00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:48.150\nSo you drop down to the command line.\n\n184\n00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:51.180\nSo really I mean you get\nthe best of both worlds, right.\n\n185\n00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:55.160\nSo I mean you still get a little\nmouse clicky navigation thing.\n\n186\n00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:57.330\nBut mouse clicky navigation thing, yes.\n\n187\n00:09:57.330 --> 00:10:00.420\nBut yeah and then if you need to get\ndown to the command line you can still\n\n188\n00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:01.990\ninto the terminal, right.\n\n189\n00:10:01.990 --> 00:10:02.740\n>> Absolutely.\n\n190\n00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:06.520\nWe have x term and so if we go up\nto applications and system tools.\n\n191\n00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:08.470\nI'll see terminal right there.\n\n192\n00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:11.310\nAnd I can jump in and here I am you know.\n\n193\n00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:15.580\nWe can run all the different things that\nwe've been doing so far and I can work,\n\n194\n00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:17.330\nI can do my stuff.\n\n195\n00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:20.100\nMake whatever changes it is that\nI feel like I need to make.\n\n196\n00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:22.850\nI'm not a root user, so\nI can su and become one.\n\n197\n00:10:24.730 --> 00:10:27.530\nAnd there we go, so\nnow I can perform my root activities.\n\n198\n00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:28.510\nAnd I can get to work.\n\n199\n00:10:28.510 --> 00:10:30.890\nSo yeah,\nabsolutely the best of both worlds.\n\n200\n00:10:30.890 --> 00:10:33.052\nAnd there's some pretty advanced\nterminal clients that are out there.\n\n201\n00:10:33.052 --> 00:10:36.800\nYou can have tabbed ones,\nwhich actually does this one do tabs?\n\n202\n00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:39.590\nLet's see.\nCan I do a open tab there we go.\n\n203\n00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:41.660\nSo I can have multiple tabs.\n\n204\n00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:45.927\nSo this would be like my TTys,\nwhere I could do Alt F1, Alt F2, Alt F3.\n\n205\n00:10:45.927 --> 00:10:49.679\nWell here I can just have a bunch of tabs,\nand I can be running different things,\n\n206\n00:10:49.679 --> 00:10:50.640\nand going through.\n\n207\n00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:55.830\nSo maybe in one of these I launch,\nhold on get my commander installed.\n\n208\n00:10:55.830 --> 00:10:58.490\nBut I could run whatever,\nsome application.\n\n209\n00:10:58.490 --> 00:10:59.310\nMaybe I run top.\n\n210\n00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:01.470\nThere we go.\n\n211\n00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:04.030\nSo I'm running top over here,\nmeanwhile I come over here.\n\n212\n00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:08.760\nAnd I start to form some action\nlike that and so while it's\n\n213\n00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:12.550\ninstalling I jump over to top and now I\ncan see yum and I can monitor performance.\n\n214\n00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:14.390\nRight, so you get bouncing around.\n\n215\n00:11:14.390 --> 00:11:18.350\nIt's still the command line, but I'm\nbenefiting from the GUI side of things,\n\n216\n00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:21.530\nbeing able to use the mouse to\nquickly jump between these tabs\n\n217\n00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:26.350\nto see things to work with them,\nand to really get some stuff done.\n\n218\n00:11:26.350 --> 00:11:28.900\nEverything we do from the command line,\nwe can do right here.\n\n219\n00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:31.420\n>> All right.\nAnd that's running from the command line?\n\n220\n00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:33.130\n>> Yeah.\n>> That window?\n\n221\n00:11:33.130 --> 00:11:34.465\n>> Again, not paying attention?\n\n222\n00:11:34.465 --> 00:11:36.990\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, this is a text based.\n\n223\n00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:37.970\nIt looks graphical, but\n\n224\n00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:41.880\nit's actually a text based little\nfile manager called Midnight Command.\n\n225\n00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:46.820\nSo I like to use it when I want to show\nfull-screen apps that stay resonant, so.\n\n226\n00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:47.840\n>> Pretty cool.\n\n227\n00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:52.160\n>> Anyhow, so there's some stuff,\nit's exciting [LAUGH].\n\n228\n00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:54.790\nIt I know it's not really\nall that exciting.\n\n229\n00:11:54.790 --> 00:11:57.340\nBut that's basically it, and so\n\n230\n00:11:57.340 --> 00:12:01.080\nthese are kind of cool, Mad at me\ncuz I'm leaving software running.\n\n231\n00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:04.780\nBut this is nom, and nom is pretty common.\n\n232\n00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:08.450\nIt's not the only graphical user\ninterface that's out there though.\n\n233\n00:12:08.450 --> 00:12:09.930\nNom is very popular.\n\n234\n00:12:09.930 --> 00:12:12.260\nAnother one that is popular is KDE.\n\n235\n00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:13.570\nAll right.\n\n236\n00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:17.021\nHere is CentOS running KDE, all right.\n\n237\n00:12:17.021 --> 00:12:23.390\nAt KDE it's a very, very sharp looking,\npleasant user interface.\n\n238\n00:12:23.390 --> 00:12:27.280\nI mean it looks sharp but\nlook at these semi transparent windows.\n\n239\n00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:28.270\nThey got rounded edges.\n\n240\n00:12:28.270 --> 00:12:30.310\nI feel like i'm talking\nabout a used car here.\n\n241\n00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:31.911\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It was kept in a garage,\n\n242\n00:12:31.911 --> 00:12:32.860\nbarely been driven.\n\n243\n00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:34.286\n>> To the grocery store and back.\n\n244\n00:12:34.286 --> 00:12:38.320\n>> But you'll see it's got a lot of little\nlaunch pad here that we can pull up.\n\n245\n00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:41.800\nWe can search for applications, or\nwe've got our applications right here,\n\n246\n00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:44.750\nso that we can go in and\nfind what we're looking for.\n\n247\n00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:49.390\nThink I wanna play some card games,\nso I'll launch patience.\n\n248\n00:12:49.390 --> 00:12:52.510\nSo you go through and\nyou fire up your Freecell.\n\n249\n00:12:52.510 --> 00:12:54.620\nAnd then we'd really get some work done,\nright.\n\n250\n00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:56.940\nBut, so KDE is very nice.\n\n251\n00:12:56.940 --> 00:12:59.230\nIt's also fairly resource\nintensive though.\n\n252\n00:12:59.230 --> 00:13:04.160\nIt takes some work, right to keep\na GUI up and running like this.\n\n253\n00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:08.850\nIf you've got a nice graphics\ncard in your computer like\n\n254\n00:13:08.850 --> 00:13:14.040\nan ATI or an Nvidia,\nthen this stuff runs really sharp.\n\n255\n00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:17.130\nIf you've got an Intel card, if you're\ndoing standard business graphics,\n\n256\n00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:18.400\nthis can be a little overbearing.\n\n257\n00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:21.610\nSo KDE is popular for home users, not so\n\n258\n00:13:21.610 --> 00:13:25.190\npopular for\nbusiness users just as a general rule.\n\n259\n00:13:25.190 --> 00:13:29.390\nSo KDE is another option, this one has\na virtual desktop like already setup for\n\n260\n00:13:29.390 --> 00:13:30.830\nme and so it's neat.\n\n261\n00:13:30.830 --> 00:13:31.740\nAll right.\n\n262\n00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:33.785\nNow there's a third one too, correct.\n\n263\n00:13:33.785 --> 00:13:36.094\n[CROSSTALK] There's tons, tons.\n\n264\n00:13:36.094 --> 00:13:38.380\n>> A third one that we're\ngonna cover here, right.\n\n265\n00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:41.230\nThe xfce something like that.\n\n266\n00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:43.190\nBunch of kdexfce.\n\n267\n00:13:43.190 --> 00:13:43.785\nJust bunch of those.\n\n268\n00:13:43.785 --> 00:13:44.730\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> All those letters.\n\n269\n00:13:44.730 --> 00:13:45.300\nYeah.\n\n270\n00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:46.590\nAnd some of them are really funny.\n\n271\n00:13:46.590 --> 00:13:50.340\nLike the original author don't remember\nwhat they stood for like fvwm is another\n\n272\n00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:54.060\none and if you ask the author, they don't\nreally remember what the letter stood for.\n\n273\n00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:56.300\nSo some of them are really nice like this.\n\n274\n00:13:56.300 --> 00:13:58.850\nRight.\nNome, nome is very pretty.\n\n275\n00:13:58.850 --> 00:14:00.310\nAnd it's very functional.\n\n276\n00:14:00.310 --> 00:14:03.390\nIt's a good balance between function and\nbeauty.\n\n277\n00:14:03.390 --> 00:14:07.180\nKDE it's high on the beauty side and\n\n278\n00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:11.390\nit's actually really good function wise\ntoo but it is pretty resource intensive.\n\n279\n00:14:11.390 --> 00:14:14.690\nMy personal favorite is\none called the Xfce.\n\n280\n00:14:14.690 --> 00:14:17.130\nIt is not very pretty, all right.\n\n281\n00:14:17.130 --> 00:14:20.660\nIt is all built around performance,\nit's extremely efficient.\n\n282\n00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:25.020\nYou don't see extra stuff, there's no 3D\nrendering involved in this desktop, but\n\n283\n00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:30.060\nyou'll your get your menu up here,\nyou get your applications, so\n\n284\n00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:32.940\nI can see my calendar and other things.\n\n285\n00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:35.890\nSo we get our programs and\napplications in here.\n\n286\n00:14:35.890 --> 00:14:39.510\nYou can run what you want,\nfire up your terminal emulator, whatever.\n\n287\n00:14:39.510 --> 00:14:43.660\nBut it's a very simple and\nplain graphical user interface.\n\n288\n00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:44.690\nOkay.\n\n289\n00:14:44.690 --> 00:14:47.420\nThere are many, many more out there.\n\n290\n00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:50.940\nAnd getting them configured\ncan be a little bit tricky.\n\n291\n00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:55.190\nTricky enough that a lot of vendors will\nmake it where when you go to download\n\n292\n00:14:55.190 --> 00:15:00.690\ntheir distro you can download the install\nCD with different default user interfaces.\n\n293\n00:15:00.690 --> 00:15:02.350\nA great example of that is Linux Mint.\n\n294\n00:15:02.350 --> 00:15:05.090\nThe Linux Mint guys do\na great job of this.\n\n295\n00:15:05.090 --> 00:15:11.220\nIf we take Linux mint, all right.\n\n296\n00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:13.940\nSo they're a Linux distribution,\nit's based on Ubuntu.\n\n297\n00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:18.260\nAnd it is a really good distribution,\nI like it.\n\n298\n00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:22.520\nAnd when you go to download it,\nif we go in here and we go to download,\n\n299\n00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:24.050\nI'll just go to the download page.\n\n300\n00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:25.360\nAll right.\n\n301\n00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:29.520\nSo the current version is,\nI guess Qiana, or however you say that.\n\n302\n00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:32.080\nBut when you go to download it,\nyou've got choices here.\n\n303\n00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:34.510\nAnd you've got the cinnamon desk top.\n\n304\n00:15:34.510 --> 00:15:38.460\nYou've got the matt or mate desktop,\nI forget how you say that.\n\n305\n00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:41.140\nThere's KDE, so\nthey actually don't have nome, so\n\n306\n00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:44.620\nyou can pick between these\ndifferent desktops that they have.\n\n307\n00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:46.238\nI don't have a machine running cinnamon.\n\n308\n00:15:48.838 --> 00:15:51.008\nLet me see if I can find\na quick image of it just so\n\n309\n00:15:51.008 --> 00:15:52.690\nyou guys can see a quick image of it.\n\n310\n00:15:52.690 --> 00:15:53.291\nHere we go.\n\n311\n00:15:53.291 --> 00:16:00.080\nSo that's what it look like very stylized,\nlooks a lot similar to the other desktops.\n\n312\n00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:01.185\nThe other one was the.\n\n313\n00:16:01.185 --> 00:16:03.310\n>> Matte,matt?\n\n314\n00:16:03.310 --> 00:16:06.154\nYeah, I think it's actually\npronounced matt or matte?\n\n315\n00:16:06.154 --> 00:16:09.420\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's some kind of African coffee bean\n\n316\n00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:10.573\nor something if I remember like serious.\n\n317\n00:16:10.573 --> 00:16:12.308\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n>> Sometimes it sounds like I make this\n\n318\n00:16:12.308 --> 00:16:15.220\nstuff up\n>> But there it is.\n\n319\n00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:16.530\nVery full featured.\n\n320\n00:16:16.530 --> 00:16:18.300\nIt's a little friendlier looking.\n\n321\n00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:19.240\nI like it.\n\n322\n00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:24.000\nBut these are just different user\ninterfaces that are available.\n\n323\n00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.870\nYou can actually have more than\none installed if you want.\n\n324\n00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:26.820\nYou can install all of these.\n\n325\n00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:28.410\nYou can install all five\nof these on your machine,\n\n326\n00:16:28.410 --> 00:16:32.550\nand when you login,\nyou have the choice to pick between them.\n\n327\n00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:36.320\nThat's important Because what we\nare looking at here, this user interface,\n\n328\n00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:40.250\nthis is not what's actually\ndriving the true user interface.\n\n329\n00:16:40.250 --> 00:16:42.930\nThis is what is drawing\non the screen sure, but\n\n330\n00:16:42.930 --> 00:16:47.535\non the back end there's a common\nsystem that's powering all of this.\n\n331\n00:16:47.535 --> 00:16:53.290\nAnd that common system is X11 or\nX11, right.\n\n332\n00:16:53.290 --> 00:16:59.286\nX11, that is the shoot it's gonna turn up\nstuff that I've searched for recently.\n\n333\n00:17:01.558 --> 00:17:02.220\nLet me just.\n\n334\n00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:02.960\nActually you know what,\n\n335\n00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:05.230\nit's kind of changed names, so\nI know why it's not turning up.\n\n336\n00:17:05.230 --> 00:17:06.450\nNow, it's x.org.\n\n337\n00:17:06.450 --> 00:17:10.740\nSo it was called X11 for the longest time,\nit's the X Windows system.\n\n338\n00:17:11.870 --> 00:17:17.330\nX Windows was the original graphical user\ninterface developed for Unix like systems.\n\n339\n00:17:17.330 --> 00:17:20.880\nAnd so it was ported to\nsupport Linux very early on.\n\n340\n00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:24.520\nAnd if you wanted a GUI in Linux,\nX Windows was all you used.\n\n341\n00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:27.100\nBut X Windows is not very user friendly.\n\n342\n00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:31.760\nAnd so over the years,\npeople have written KDE and\n\n343\n00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:35.310\nGnome and XFC and stuff like that.\n\n344\n00:17:35.310 --> 00:17:40.700\nThat lay on top of X Windows, and gives\nit all sorts of additional functionality.\n\n345\n00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:41.870\nSo think of it kind of like Linux.\n\n346\n00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:45.710\nWith Linux you had the Linux kernel, and\nthen the various distributions out there\n\n347\n00:17:45.710 --> 00:17:48.390\nhave all the tools that wrap\naround it to create your OS.\n\n348\n00:17:48.390 --> 00:17:51.820\nWell X windows is kind\nof like that kernel.\n\n349\n00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:55.410\nIt's the heart of your GUI and\nthen your desktop, your\n\n350\n00:17:55.410 --> 00:17:59.100\nWindow manager is what that's called, your\nwindow manager lays on top of that and\n\n351\n00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:02.360\nit's what creates what you actually\ninteract with on the screen.\n\n352\n00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:05.090\nSo you're picking between all sorts\nof different window managers.\n\n353\n00:18:05.090 --> 00:18:08.550\nI might pick KDE or I might pick Gnome.\n\n354\n00:18:08.550 --> 00:18:12.290\nAt the end of the day underneath it is X.\n\n355\n00:18:12.290 --> 00:18:16.150\nNow X went through several revisions over\nthe years, and so it was X11R5, X11R6,\n\n356\n00:18:16.150 --> 00:18:19.380\neach of the different releases.\n\n357\n00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:24.680\nAnd then with X11R7,\nthey renamed it to just x.org.\n\n358\n00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:28.010\nOkay, and if you look at\ntheir website it's www.x.org.\n\n359\n00:18:28.010 --> 00:18:31.400\nThat's why they did that, so it would\nkind of match in line with domain name.\n\n360\n00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:35.870\nSo now what's called x org and\nit's still freely available.\n\n361\n00:18:35.870 --> 00:18:37.840\nIt's ported to tons of systems.\n\n362\n00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:41.350\nIt can run just about anywhere and\nwhat x does is it\n\n363\n00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:45.100\nhelps ensure the different programs\ncan run in Windows and that they.\n\n364\n00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:47.950\nNot Windows like Microsoft but\nin Windows on our screen.\n\n365\n00:18:47.950 --> 00:18:52.190\nAnd that they can interact and multi-task\nwithout interfering with each other.\n\n366\n00:18:52.190 --> 00:18:57.476\nIt's taking care that graphically drawing\nof these Windows onto our screen.\n\n367\n00:18:57.476 --> 00:19:00.610\n>> Don, so\nthis reminds me a lot like android.\n\n368\n00:19:00.610 --> 00:19:03.880\nRight.\nI'm an android user and at the base,\n\n369\n00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:09.720\nright of Android we have wether it's AOSP\nor Touch Wiz or something like that,\n\n370\n00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:13.430\nbut then you can different launchers that\ngo on top of this where you can interact\n\n371\n00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:15.870\nwith everything and different\nlaunchers you can different looks and\n\n372\n00:19:15.870 --> 00:19:17.930\ndifferent little things thrown in there.\n\n373\n00:19:17.930 --> 00:19:19.570\nYeah, reminds me a lot like that.\n\n374\n00:19:19.570 --> 00:19:21.120\n>> That's a great example.\n\n375\n00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:25.280\nUnder the hood and in fact I think\nandroid doesn't android use xorg?\n\n376\n00:19:26.330 --> 00:19:27.050\nI think it might.\n\n377\n00:19:27.050 --> 00:19:28.000\nI'd have to look that up.\n\n378\n00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.180\nI'm not sure now.\n\n379\n00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:32.500\nBut any anyhow,\nit has to used some kind of,\n\n380\n00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:37.530\nI'm forgetting the word for\nwhat that's called, shoot it's a really\n\n381\n00:19:37.530 --> 00:19:42.545\nfancy long name too for what's responsible\nfor drawing crap on your screen.\n\n382\n00:19:42.545 --> 00:19:43.162\n[LAUGH] All right.\n\n383\n00:19:43.162 --> 00:19:45.040\n[LAUGH] I'll have to look\nit up during the break.\n\n384\n00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:46.150\nNow it's a cool word.\n\n385\n00:19:46.150 --> 00:19:48.395\nI would have seemed really smart if\nI could have remembered it off hand.\n\n386\n00:19:48.395 --> 00:19:49.580\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But anyhow, so\n\n387\n00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:52.240\nthen it has to have a GUI on top of it,\nand so yeah,\n\n388\n00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:56.740\nyou use launchers in Android, but here\nwe have our Window managers, all right.\n\n389\n00:19:56.740 --> 00:20:00.120\nSo our Windows are being\nkinda generated by these.\n\n390\n00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:02.820\nWe can pick from any window\nmanager we want, all right.\n\n391\n00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:05.520\nWhen you boot up that graphical UI though.\n\n392\n00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:07.670\nThe first thing you see is\nnot your Window manager.\n\n393\n00:20:07.670 --> 00:20:09.560\nIt's actually your desktop manager.\n\n394\n00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:12.500\nThe desktop manager is what determines,\nwell first off,\n\n395\n00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:13.680\nit handles your login, right.\n\n396\n00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:16.740\nCuz you gotta login before you\nget the ability to run things.\n\n397\n00:20:17.790 --> 00:20:19.500\nSo the desktop manager's gonna ask you for\n\n398\n00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:22.328\nyour username and\npassword before you login.\n\n399\n00:20:22.328 --> 00:20:26.900\nOnce you login, it's then going to launch\nthe appropriate Window manager and\n\n400\n00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:29.670\nit's gonna run that Window\nmanager under your credentials.\n\n401\n00:20:29.670 --> 00:20:30.610\nSo that it's protected.\n\n402\n00:20:30.610 --> 00:20:33.150\nSo that it's got limited access\n\n403\n00:20:33.150 --> 00:20:35.410\npermissions limited to whatever\nyour permissions are, so\n\n404\n00:20:35.410 --> 00:20:38.810\nthe Window manager can't do anything\nthat you couldn't do yourself.\n\n405\n00:20:38.810 --> 00:20:40.250\nThat's pretty important.\n\n406\n00:20:40.250 --> 00:20:45.160\nSo while we have a bunch of different\nfront ends different Window managers,\n\n407\n00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:47.980\nthere are a handful of desktop managers\nthat are out there also that we'll\n\n408\n00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:52.060\nsee a little bit later, like KDM, GDM, so\n\n409\n00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:55.290\nthat's a KDE desktop manager,\nthe GNOME desktop manager.\n\n410\n00:20:55.290 --> 00:20:59.280\nThere's XDM, which is just\nthe X-Windows desktop manager.\n\n411\n00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:01.480\nSo we'll see that kind of combination.\n\n412\n00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:05.150\nThe desktop manager that handles just\ngetting us connected into the system,\n\n413\n00:21:05.150 --> 00:21:07.590\nlogged in, and\nlaunching the Window manager, and\n\n414\n00:21:07.590 --> 00:21:11.640\nthen the Window manager itself,\nwhich is what we interact with, right.\n\n415\n00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:13.610\nNow which one you pick is up to you.\n\n416\n00:21:13.610 --> 00:21:15.210\nDifferent distribution for\ndifferent one's.\n\n417\n00:21:15.210 --> 00:21:17.520\nI know I showed Linux meant which is not.\n\n418\n00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:18.930\nNot the most popular Linux.\n\n419\n00:21:18.930 --> 00:21:21.100\nLet's take all the Ubuntu.\n\n420\n00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:25.040\nSo Ubuntu which is from [INAUDIBLE].\n\n421\n00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:30.706\nAnd if I remember, I default to what\ndoes do they default to, is it nome?\n\n422\n00:21:30.706 --> 00:21:32.420\n>> Hmm, you got me.\n\n423\n00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:36.980\n>> Yeah, I don't recall, so I want to say\nthey default to nome, but if you go around\n\n424\n00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:42.000\nand look you'll find other people out\nthere that build things like K Ubuntu or.\n\n425\n00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.330\nKubuntu or however you want to say that.\n\n426\n00:21:44.330 --> 00:21:49.740\nAnd all it is is an ubuntu that's been\nreconfigured to use KDE by default,\n\n427\n00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:53.820\nso when you launch it it's the same\nubuntu under the hood, but\n\n428\n00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:55.990\nthe window manager set the default to KDE.\n\n429\n00:21:55.990 --> 00:22:00.980\nNow you could have just added KDE to the\nregular ubuntu and gone that route but you\n\n430\n00:22:00.980 --> 00:22:03.930\nhave to know how to do it and if you don't\nknow how to do it, this might be easier.\n\n431\n00:22:03.930 --> 00:22:06.810\nJust getting a distro that\nalready has it turned on.\n\n432\n00:22:06.810 --> 00:22:08.820\nSo you'll find a lot of\ndistros where they do that.\n\n433\n00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:11.520\nWhere they just change the windows\nmanager and that's it.\n\n434\n00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:12.020\n>> Mm hm.\n>> So.\n\n435\n00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:17.238\nBut Trusty Tahr,\nthat's a goat of some sort.\n\n436\n00:22:17.238 --> 00:22:19.800\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, a lion goat.\n\n437\n00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:25.380\n>> Yeah, I'm not a big fan of Ubuntu, just\nbecause how bloated it gets so quickly, so\n\n438\n00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:29.440\nmuch extra software in there, it's really\nhard to keep it narrowed and focused.\n\n439\n00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:31.360\nBut that's me,\nbecause I'm kind of a minimalist.\n\n440\n00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:34.590\nIf you're a feature person, Ubuntu is\nawesome, it's got all the features you\n\n441\n00:22:34.590 --> 00:22:37.350\nwant, so different people,\ndifferent needs, I guess.\n\n442\n00:22:37.350 --> 00:22:38.462\n>> Right.\n>> I gotta behave myself.\n\n443\n00:22:38.462 --> 00:22:42.130\n>> Some do, do you have a lot\nof icons on your desktop?\n\n444\n00:22:42.130 --> 00:22:44.870\nOr do you just keep everything,\nlike on your start screen?\n\n445\n00:22:44.870 --> 00:22:46.690\n>> I try not to keep icons on my desktop.\n\n446\n00:22:46.690 --> 00:22:47.660\nI try to keep it clean.\n\n447\n00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:51.006\n>> No, no, that's what it's there for is,\n>> But I can't see and\n\n448\n00:22:51.006 --> 00:22:52.780\nI quickly lost things.\n\n449\n00:22:52.780 --> 00:22:53.762\n>> Is it now?\n\n450\n00:22:53.762 --> 00:22:55.030\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] All right.\n\n451\n00:22:55.030 --> 00:22:56.995\nWell that's an argument for\na different day.\n\n452\n00:22:56.995 --> 00:23:01.665\n[LAUGH] Just rest assured in the fact\nthat I'm right and Nate's wrong.\n\n453\n00:23:01.665 --> 00:23:03.510\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right.\n\n454\n00:23:03.510 --> 00:23:07.420\n>> So that's kind of an overview there\nof what Window managers are like,\n\n455\n00:23:07.420 --> 00:23:09.970\nwhat they do and there are a ton more.\n\n456\n00:23:09.970 --> 00:23:14.010\nYou might be screaming at your monitor\nright now, going Don you forgot,\n\n457\n00:23:14.010 --> 00:23:18.120\nI love ice wm or whatever one cuz\nthere are literally hundreds of\n\n458\n00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:20.900\nthem that are out there and\nit's not like there's a right or a wrong.\n\n459\n00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:23.050\nYou pick which one you like best.\n\n460\n00:23:23.050 --> 00:23:27.840\nNow personally, I like to pick ones that\nI know are stable and gonna be around\n\n461\n00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:31.170\na while, which means I normally\npick the ones the OSes default to.\n\n462\n00:23:31.170 --> 00:23:34.950\nBut sometimes it gets really frustrating,\nbecause organizations like Ubuntu,\n\n463\n00:23:34.950 --> 00:23:38.360\nthey change every couple of\ndistributions and when they switch UIs,\n\n464\n00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:41.515\nall of a sudden you gotta retrain your\nemployees, and that's really frustrating.\n\n465\n00:23:41.515 --> 00:23:43.700\nSo there's pros and cons to that.\n\n466\n00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:44.590\nAll right.\n\n467\n00:23:44.590 --> 00:23:46.528\nAnother thing just to put\nin the back of your mind,\n\n468\n00:23:46.528 --> 00:23:49.357\nit probably won't show up on the exam,\nbut I just want you to be aware of.\n\n469\n00:23:49.357 --> 00:23:54.245\nIs that X one one, or X eleven, Xorg,\nwhatever we want to call it today,\n\n470\n00:23:54.245 --> 00:23:55.180\nit's old.\n\n471\n00:23:55.180 --> 00:24:00.298\nIt is really old, I can't preface this,\nbecause I'm older than it is.\n\n472\n00:24:00.298 --> 00:24:01.990\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But it just had it's 30th\n\n473\n00:24:01.990 --> 00:24:02.550\nbirthday, okay.\n\n474\n00:24:02.550 --> 00:24:04.850\nSo it is 30 years old.\n\n475\n00:24:04.850 --> 00:24:05.996\nIt has been around a while.\n\n476\n00:24:05.996 --> 00:24:07.829\nIt was developed in the 80's.\n\n477\n00:24:07.829 --> 00:24:11.459\nAnd like any software that's\nbeen around for 30 years,\n\n478\n00:24:11.459 --> 00:24:13.550\nit's starting to show its age.\n\n479\n00:24:13.550 --> 00:24:17.759\nYou've got a lot of code in there that was\nwritten by people that are long since done\n\n480\n00:24:17.759 --> 00:24:18.745\nwith developing.\n\n481\n00:24:18.745 --> 00:24:21.900\nAnd it's just,\nit's getting a little rough.\n\n482\n00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:26.663\nAnd so they are, they being\nthe programming community at large,\n\n483\n00:24:26.663 --> 00:24:30.993\nare looking to create the next\nsuccessor to replace Xorg and\n\n484\n00:24:30.993 --> 00:24:36.288\ntake over as the new graphical desktop\nenvironment for the Linux world.\n\n485\n00:24:36.288 --> 00:24:40.985\nThe two main competitors that are out\nthere right now, there's Mir,\n\n486\n00:24:40.985 --> 00:24:45.454\nM-I-R, Mir which is from Canonical,\nthe people who do Ubuntu.\n\n487\n00:24:45.454 --> 00:24:49.920\nThe Mir window,\nsee this is where I need that compositor.\n\n488\n00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:52.910\nGot it, that's the word,\nthe desktop compositor.\n\n489\n00:24:52.910 --> 00:24:54.580\nI couldn't remember it.\n\n490\n00:24:54.580 --> 00:24:58.641\nIt composes the windows on\nthe screen that's what it does.\n\n491\n00:24:58.641 --> 00:25:02.552\n[LAUGH] So X11 is a compositor,\nI knew I'd remember.\n\n492\n00:25:02.552 --> 00:25:09.320\nSo anyhow, Mir is a compositor that's out\nthere and it's definitely coming along.\n\n493\n00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:12.970\nIt's got some quirks and some problems,\nso it's not generally accepted yet.\n\n494\n00:25:12.970 --> 00:25:15.640\nThe other one is Wayland,\nWayland is another one.\n\n495\n00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:18.730\nIt's got a cool name, I don't know\nthe history of the name on it, but\n\n496\n00:25:18.730 --> 00:25:20.960\nit's another one that's up and coming.\n\n497\n00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:25.990\nAnd so, you're starting to see like\nFedora, Red Hat's experimental OS.\n\n498\n00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:28.580\nWhere they're testing out Wayland support,\nand\n\n499\n00:25:28.580 --> 00:25:30.606\nthey're testing out other\nthings like Mir support.\n\n500\n00:25:30.606 --> 00:25:35.840\nIn the next few years,\nprobably in the next three years I'd say,\n\n501\n00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:39.578\nwe'll probably start to see a shift\nin people moving away from Xorg.\n\n502\n00:25:39.578 --> 00:25:44.040\nBut today if you're running\na stable version of Linux today,\n\n503\n00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:45.980\nyou're running Xorg.\n\n504\n00:25:45.980 --> 00:25:48.420\nIt really, for the longest time,\nwas your only choice.\n\n505\n00:25:48.420 --> 00:25:50.201\nIt was the only one that\nwas fully featured,\n\n506\n00:25:50.201 --> 00:25:51.704\neverything else was experimental.\n\n507\n00:25:51.704 --> 00:25:54.304\nOnly today are we getting to that\npoint where we have not one but\n\n508\n00:25:54.304 --> 00:25:56.204\ntwo competitors that\nare both really close.\n\n509\n00:25:56.204 --> 00:25:58.995\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n510\n00:25:58.995 --> 00:26:03.538\nIf you don't already, there's a lot of\ngreat Linux news sites that are out there.\n\n511\n00:26:03.538 --> 00:26:09.765\nI visit one called Phoronix,\nand it is phoronix.com.\n\n512\n00:26:09.765 --> 00:26:14.771\nAnd these guys, they post news and\nadvertisements and they post news about\n\n513\n00:26:14.771 --> 00:26:19.787\nthings that are happening in the Linux\nworld and how timely, look at this.\n\n514\n00:26:19.787 --> 00:26:22.037\nMir display server picks\nup some new features.\n\n515\n00:26:22.037 --> 00:26:26.625\nSo, Mir 0.3 is the next one,\nthe next release that's come out.\n\n516\n00:26:26.625 --> 00:26:30.365\nAnd I bet if we keep looking, we'll\nfind something in here about Wayland.\n\n517\n00:26:31.495 --> 00:26:34.670\nLet's see, KDE plasma got an update.\n\n518\n00:26:34.670 --> 00:26:36.537\nBlah, blah, blah.\n\n519\n00:26:36.537 --> 00:26:39.069\nNow, maybe we can search and\nsee if we can find it on my own, but, so\n\n520\n00:26:39.069 --> 00:26:40.037\nthey post a lot of stuff.\n\n521\n00:26:40.037 --> 00:26:43.734\nSo, if you're trying to\nfollow the developments,\n\n522\n00:26:43.734 --> 00:26:48.985\nseeing as things are coming up,\nyou can kinda watch in here and see.\n\n523\n00:26:48.985 --> 00:26:52.935\nHere we go, so, GNOME Shell\nWayland Benchmarks From Fedora 20.\n\n524\n00:26:52.935 --> 00:26:54.365\nSo they're actually testing it out.\n\n525\n00:26:54.365 --> 00:26:56.215\nNow notice what they're\nsaying in that sentence.\n\n526\n00:26:56.215 --> 00:27:00.230\nThey're still running GNOME\nas their window manager.\n\n527\n00:27:00.230 --> 00:27:05.720\nBut underneath it the desktop compositor,\nthat's Wayland, that's replacing Xorg.\n\n528\n00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:10.240\nAnd it even says it, so while an Xorg\nserver is still used by default on Fedora\n\n529\n00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:14.070\n20, Wayland has become a viable option for\nearly adopters.\n\n530\n00:27:14.070 --> 00:27:16.290\nAnd that's dated,\nthat's actually dated from December.\n\n531\n00:27:16.290 --> 00:27:17.850\nThat's six months ago.\n\n532\n00:27:17.850 --> 00:27:19.490\nThat's not even a new article.\n\n533\n00:27:19.490 --> 00:27:23.470\nBut yeah, you'll see things don't\nreally look different, right, and\n\n534\n00:27:23.470 --> 00:27:24.580\nthat's not the point.\n\n535\n00:27:24.580 --> 00:27:28.320\nThe desktop compositor on the bottom, it's\nsupposed to provide stability, security.\n\n536\n00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:31.860\nThat's really an area where X11 is weak,\nor Xorg is weak.\n\n537\n00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:35.100\nBecause it was designed\nin a friendlier time, and\n\n538\n00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:39.660\nwe didn't have the interception\ntechniques that we have today but, yeah.\n\n539\n00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:41.510\nYou'll see a lot of news on this stuff.\n\n540\n00:27:41.510 --> 00:27:44.170\nIt's a good idea to stay\nup on Linux news sites.\n\n541\n00:27:44.170 --> 00:27:47.880\nI used to say, yeah,\nmake sure you watch Slashdot,\n\n542\n00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:49.245\nthere's a lot of stuff\nthat comes up on there.\n\n543\n00:27:49.245 --> 00:27:52.710\nNow it's just mostly garbage\nnews on there but Phoronix,\n\n544\n00:27:52.710 --> 00:27:54.760\nthey really have good stuff on Linux.\n\n545\n00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:58.162\nIt's on my little RSS feed\nlist I check every day.\n\n546\n00:27:58.162 --> 00:28:02.981\n>> So then, so\nwhether you're on a CentOS or Red Hat or\n\n547\n00:28:02.981 --> 00:28:08.371\nDebian, can you use any of\nthese desktop managers then?\n\n548\n00:28:08.371 --> 00:28:10.580\n>> Someone may or\nmay not have made a package for it.\n\n549\n00:28:10.580 --> 00:28:14.110\nIf they made a package for it,\nyeah, it's super easy, right?\n\n550\n00:28:14.110 --> 00:28:16.910\nBut if they haven't made a package for\nit, then you got to get the source and\n\n551\n00:28:16.910 --> 00:28:17.590\ncompile it.\n\n552\n00:28:17.590 --> 00:28:18.705\nAnd it becomes very, very challenging.\n\n553\n00:28:18.705 --> 00:28:21.640\nIt's really designed for\ndevelopers at that point.\n\n554\n00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:23.330\nSo, I don't know.\n\n555\n00:28:23.330 --> 00:28:27.840\nIf we were to do Debian,\nlet's see if we have any support.\n\n556\n00:28:29.670 --> 00:28:30.780\nThat's not what I want.\n\n557\n00:28:30.780 --> 00:28:32.620\nThat's probably gonna\ngive me something bad.\n\n558\n00:28:32.620 --> 00:28:36.218\nAny site, chaosreigns.com,\nI probably don't want to go to that.\n\n559\n00:28:36.218 --> 00:28:40.420\nBut, here, packages.debian.org,\nthat's what I want.\n\n560\n00:28:40.420 --> 00:28:42.510\nAnd so we can see if there's\nsome Wayland packages or not.\n\n561\n00:28:42.510 --> 00:28:46.040\nLooks like we've got libwayland client.\n\n562\n00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:47.630\nSo yeah,\nlooks like somebody's building it.\n\n563\n00:28:47.630 --> 00:28:51.795\nLibwaylanddev, xwayland.\n\n564\n00:28:51.795 --> 00:28:58.630\nExperimental rc-buggy, and\nthen there's libwayland0 wheezy stables.\n\n565\n00:28:58.630 --> 00:29:02.100\nThey actually have a stable release for\nwheezy so, yeah, you could deploy it.\n\n566\n00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:03.570\nSo, that's really the trick right there,\n\n567\n00:29:03.570 --> 00:29:05.840\nis your distro may or\nmay not support it yet.\n\n568\n00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:07.230\nBut, I can guarantee you,\n\n569\n00:29:07.230 --> 00:29:10.050\nthey're all testing it,\nbecause this is the way that it's going.\n\n570\n00:29:10.050 --> 00:29:12.730\nYou don't want to to be the last\ndistribution still running Xorg\n\n571\n00:29:12.730 --> 00:29:15.290\nwhen everybody else has moved\non to these new ones, and\n\n572\n00:29:15.290 --> 00:29:18.140\nthe big challenge is\nthe video card vendors.\n\n573\n00:29:18.140 --> 00:29:23.160\nATI, NVIDIA, and Intel,\nto a lesser extent, those three guys,\n\n574\n00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:27.980\nwhen they write their video card drivers\nfor Linux, they're not writing a video\n\n575\n00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:31.420\ncard driver for the CLI, your CLI\ndoesn't need a crazy video card driver.\n\n576\n00:29:31.420 --> 00:29:33.550\nThey're writing it for X.\n\n577\n00:29:33.550 --> 00:29:38.020\nAnd so all these years they've\ncreated X server drivers, right?\n\n578\n00:29:38.020 --> 00:29:39.413\nFor Xorg.\n\n579\n00:29:39.413 --> 00:29:43.912\nNow they're having to switch up and write\nMir drivers, or Wayland drivers, okay.\n\n580\n00:29:43.912 --> 00:29:46.750\nAnd what's gonna happen,\nthey're gonna pick the most popular ones.\n\n581\n00:29:46.750 --> 00:29:50.810\nAnd so there will come a time when\none of them takes over the lead.\n\n582\n00:29:50.810 --> 00:29:53.300\nAnd so you'll stop getting drivers for\nthe other.\n\n583\n00:29:53.300 --> 00:29:54.810\nSo you do need to stay on top of it.\n\n584\n00:29:54.810 --> 00:29:56.970\nAnd I can guarantee you that all\nthe distros are doing that right now.\n\n585\n00:29:56.970 --> 00:30:00.080\nThey're keeping an eye on this\nbecause there's multiple ones.\n\n586\n00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:04.360\nBut on the exam, Wayland and\nMir are not stable yet.\n\n587\n00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:05.910\nNot considered truly stable.\n\n588\n00:30:05.910 --> 00:30:08.100\nSo we're not using them in\nthe business world, everything's Xorg.\n\n589\n00:30:08.100 --> 00:30:10.640\nSo that's what we're gonna focus\non the rest of the episode.\n\n590\n00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:11.450\n>> Hm, nice.\n\n591\n00:30:11.450 --> 00:30:12.000\n>> Sound good?\n\n592\n00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:13.412\n>> Yep.\nSounds great.\n\n593\n00:30:13.412 --> 00:30:16.020\n>> All right, well, ladies and gentleman,\nwhy don't we stop here and take a break?\n\n594\n00:30:16.020 --> 00:30:20.640\nAnd when we get back I wanna take\na stab at basically installing\n\n595\n00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:24.300\nX Windows on my basic install where\nI chose not to install one, right?\n\n596\n00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:27.440\nSo, if you pop the CD in and\nyou pick graphical, it's really easy, but\n\n597\n00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:28.500\nwhat about after the fact?\n\n598\n00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:31.814\nI wanna show you what's involved in\ngetting a GUI up and running and\n\n599\n00:30:31.814 --> 00:30:33.090\nwhat it's like.\n\n600\n00:30:33.090 --> 00:30:34.180\nThe joy of a GUI.\n\n601\n00:30:34.180 --> 00:30:34.680\n>> Nice.\n\n602\n00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:36.121\n>> All right, so stay tuned.\n\n603\n00:30:36.121 --> 00:30:40.135\nWe'll be back in a few.\n\n604\n00:30:40.135 --> 00:30:46.287\n[SOUND] All right, welcome back everybody.\n\n605\n00:30:46.287 --> 00:30:49.573\nSo in the last section or segment,\nwhatever, we got a chance to see some of\n\n606\n00:30:49.573 --> 00:30:53.410\nthe different user interfaces available,\nsome of the different desktops.\n\n607\n00:30:53.410 --> 00:30:57.030\nAnd now I wanna show you\nguys how to install them.\n\n608\n00:30:57.030 --> 00:31:00.900\nInstalling the GUI, it's super easy if\nyou do when you install the OS, right?\n\n609\n00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:02.710\nJust a little check mark and you're done.\n\n610\n00:31:02.710 --> 00:31:04.340\nIt takes care of everything.\n\n611\n00:31:04.340 --> 00:31:08.780\nBut what if you did a basic install,\nyou've got a command line interface, and\n\n612\n00:31:08.780 --> 00:31:09.520\nyou change your mind?\n\n613\n00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:10.860\nYou're like well, all right,\n\n614\n00:31:10.860 --> 00:31:13.910\nI guess I would kind of like\nto have that GUI, all right?\n\n615\n00:31:13.910 --> 00:31:16.000\nThere's a few things we have to do.\n\n616\n00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:19.138\nFirst off we have to install\nthe appropriate packages,\n\n617\n00:31:19.138 --> 00:31:22.287\nthe appropriate software\nthat's gonna power the GUI.\n\n618\n00:31:22.287 --> 00:31:26.410\nSecondly, we need to tell\nthe operating system to boot the GUI.\n\n619\n00:31:26.410 --> 00:31:29.900\nOtherwise we can manually run it,\nyou can run the GUI when you want it, and\n\n620\n00:31:29.900 --> 00:31:31.660\nthen close it, and then not have it.\n\n621\n00:31:31.660 --> 00:31:32.460\nSome people like that.\n\n622\n00:31:32.460 --> 00:31:34.450\nIf it's a server,\nmaybe you want the GUI every now and\n\n623\n00:31:34.450 --> 00:31:36.610\nthen just to make administration easier.\n\n624\n00:31:36.610 --> 00:31:38.710\nAnd then when you're not using it,\nyou just leave it closed.\n\n625\n00:31:38.710 --> 00:31:41.900\nSo maybe you don't want it to boot\nevery time the system fires up.\n\n626\n00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:43.620\nIt's kind of up to you, all right?\n\n627\n00:31:43.620 --> 00:31:45.690\nWell, I'm gonna take my\nbasic install right here.\n\n628\n00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:50.439\nAnd yep, this guy and\nhe's just straight up CLI, right?\n\n629\n00:31:50.439 --> 00:31:52.496\nWhen I boot up,\nit dumps me to a text prompt.\n\n630\n00:31:52.496 --> 00:31:56.278\nAnd it never actually goes Into\na graphical user interface.\n\n631\n00:31:56.278 --> 00:31:59.940\nIn fact the GUI's not even installed,\nI didn't pick that option.\n\n632\n00:31:59.940 --> 00:32:03.180\nSo if I want it I'm gonna\nhave to get it installed.\n\n633\n00:32:03.180 --> 00:32:07.422\nWell, let's just start with GNOME, because\nGNOME is the default desktop in CentOS and\n\n634\n00:32:07.422 --> 00:32:09.848\nit's probably one of\nthe easier ones to install.\n\n635\n00:32:09.848 --> 00:32:15.700\nIf I wanna install it, I can use\nthe yum groupinstall command, right?\n\n636\n00:32:15.700 --> 00:32:20.667\nSo, I actually have a group for\nit that is called the X Window system,\n\n637\n00:32:20.667 --> 00:32:23.060\nlike that, right?\n\n638\n00:32:23.060 --> 00:32:26.620\nSo, technically, that is going to be\nX Windows, and it doesn't say it.\n\n639\n00:32:26.620 --> 00:32:28.230\nBut it's going to combine GNOME with it.\n\n640\n00:32:28.230 --> 00:32:32.040\nGNOME is going to be our window manager\nby default if we do that install.\n\n641\n00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:33.710\nNow, I could stop here,\n\n642\n00:32:33.710 --> 00:32:36.740\nbut there is a couple little\ncaveats we need to be aware of.\n\n643\n00:32:36.740 --> 00:32:39.190\nFirst off, fonts.\n\n644\n00:32:39.190 --> 00:32:41.370\nLinux has fonts built in.\n\n645\n00:32:41.370 --> 00:32:44.224\nAnd a lot of the fonts are very nice and\nperfectly serviceable.\n\n646\n00:32:44.224 --> 00:32:48.307\nBut in the GUI world oftentimes\nthere are different fonts.\n\n647\n00:32:48.307 --> 00:32:51.748\nAnd if we just install X Windows it's\ngonna have our native font library and\n\n648\n00:32:51.748 --> 00:32:54.080\nyou might have programs\nthat don't match up.\n\n649\n00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:57.930\nIf you start seeing weird characters\nlike little squares, black marks.\n\n650\n00:32:57.930 --> 00:33:00.539\nThings like that on the screen and\nyou can't read anything,\n\n651\n00:33:00.539 --> 00:33:03.057\nthat usually means you're\nmissing some font libraries.\n\n652\n00:33:03.057 --> 00:33:08.190\nSo we typically want to add\nthe fonts option to the end of it.\n\n653\n00:33:08.190 --> 00:33:11.695\nAll right,\nthat's another group that we can install.\n\n654\n00:33:11.695 --> 00:33:16.095\nNow if we stop here, if that's all I\ninstall, I'm gonna get X Windows, and\n\n655\n00:33:16.095 --> 00:33:17.485\nit's not gonna be very pretty.\n\n656\n00:33:17.485 --> 00:33:20.135\nIt's just gonna be straight\nup X Windows and that's it.\n\n657\n00:33:20.135 --> 00:33:24.105\nSo we normally want to couple that with\nour desktop and applications and so\n\n658\n00:33:24.105 --> 00:33:27.895\nI'm gonna add that group also,\nthe desktop group.\n\n659\n00:33:28.935 --> 00:33:33.570\nI did a basic install which is really\nthe server install, not much of a GUI.\n\n660\n00:33:33.570 --> 00:33:37.100\nIf I leave it at the X Window system\nthat'll be the minimal GUI option.\n\n661\n00:33:37.100 --> 00:33:42.260\nIf I do desktop now I'll get\na full featured GNOME desktop.\n\n662\n00:33:42.260 --> 00:33:43.850\nSo I'll go ahead and run that.\n\n663\n00:33:43.850 --> 00:33:46.835\nAnd it's gonna reach out and\ninstall those groups.\n\n664\n00:33:46.835 --> 00:33:50.042\nOkay, now when that's done, well,\n\n665\n00:33:50.042 --> 00:33:54.766\nfirst off you'll notice there's one or\ntwo packages.\n\n666\n00:33:54.766 --> 00:33:58.630\n309 packages, which sounds like a lot,\nthe download size is only 151 Meg.\n\n667\n00:33:58.630 --> 00:34:00.150\nSo we're not talking about giant stuff.\n\n668\n00:34:00.150 --> 00:34:03.780\nUnpacked on the hard drive it's\nabout 500 Megs to get this GUI.\n\n669\n00:34:03.780 --> 00:34:06.220\nSo it's gonna reach out there and\nget it and turn them on.\n\n670\n00:34:06.220 --> 00:34:09.290\nThese are packages ranging\nfrom all sorts of things.\n\n671\n00:34:09.290 --> 00:34:13.360\nVideo card drivers,\nconfiguration files, different fonts,\n\n672\n00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:16.330\ndifferent language and localization files.\n\n673\n00:34:16.330 --> 00:34:19.040\nA lot of graphics libraries.\n\n674\n00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:22.550\nLibraries for drawing buttons and\nimages on your screen and\n\n675\n00:34:22.550 --> 00:34:24.500\nall the GUI stuff that we need.\n\n676\n00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:27.590\nAll of that is being\nrepresented here as a package.\n\n677\n00:34:27.590 --> 00:34:29.070\nSo we'll let it churn along.\n\n678\n00:34:29.070 --> 00:34:33.000\nSome of these I recognize,\nthe control center, that's part of,\n\n679\n00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:36.490\nkind like our administrative tools for\nmanaging the system.\n\n680\n00:34:36.490 --> 00:34:38.320\nSome of these I'm not\nreally familiar with.\n\n681\n00:34:39.340 --> 00:34:42.600\nFestival, Festival's apparently some\nkind of speech tools that it's got.\n\n682\n00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:45.438\nThere's GDM, the GNOME desktop manager.\n\n683\n00:34:45.438 --> 00:34:48.720\nThat's gonna be pivotal to\nactually getting our desktop\n\n684\n00:34:48.720 --> 00:34:49.780\nvisible to where we can see it.\n\n685\n00:34:49.780 --> 00:34:53.420\nThat's what's gonna launch our window\nmanager and empower that for us.\n\n686\n00:34:53.420 --> 00:34:55.640\nThere's the GNOME desktop.\n\n687\n00:34:55.640 --> 00:34:57.570\nActually going right there.\n\n688\n00:34:57.570 --> 00:34:59.530\nAnd you'll see,\nthat's a pretty big chunk of our download.\n\n689\n00:34:59.530 --> 00:35:00.770\nIt's taking a moment.\n\n690\n00:35:00.770 --> 00:35:03.918\nAnd then it's moving through and\ngetting some of the other things.\n\n691\n00:35:03.918 --> 00:35:08.950\nSo while I didn't specifically say GNOME\nin the groups that I chose to install,\n\n692\n00:35:08.950 --> 00:35:12.690\nGnome is the default desktop, and so that\nis what it's bringing in and setting up.\n\n693\n00:35:12.690 --> 00:35:14.060\nSo it's gonna do all those.\n\n694\n00:35:14.060 --> 00:35:16.810\n>> So Don, these group installs,\n\n695\n00:35:16.810 --> 00:35:22.800\nin the quotes there you specified\nX Windows system, and desktop and fonts.\n\n696\n00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:24.950\nThese are groups then of packages.\n\n697\n00:35:24.950 --> 00:35:27.540\n>> Right, so\ninstead of specifying all 309.\n\n698\n00:35:27.540 --> 00:35:28.330\n>> We could have done that.\n\n699\n00:35:28.330 --> 00:35:32.230\n[LAUGH]\n>> You still get the same thing.\n\n700\n00:35:32.230 --> 00:35:35.350\nSo then, I guess,\nwhere do you find these groups or\n\n701\n00:35:35.350 --> 00:35:38.410\nI guess these packages\nare all bundled together.\n\n702\n00:35:38.410 --> 00:35:41.080\nIs there a list or something?\n\n703\n00:35:41.080 --> 00:35:43.790\n>> We saw it in one of the earlier\nepisodes, I don't think you were in,\n\n704\n00:35:43.790 --> 00:35:46.090\nwhich was the yum group list command.\n\n705\n00:35:46.090 --> 00:35:49.670\nAnd then that will give you a list\nof the groups that are available and\n\n706\n00:35:49.670 --> 00:35:52.510\nIn the exam objectives, I think\nthey mention like five of them, and\n\n707\n00:35:52.510 --> 00:35:55.400\nin the install you see like seven I think.\n\n708\n00:35:55.400 --> 00:35:58.670\nBut then when you do yum group list, you\nsee that there's like 30 of them there,\n\n709\n00:35:58.670 --> 00:35:59.260\nthere's a bunch.\n\n710\n00:35:59.260 --> 00:36:00.800\nSo yeah that's how you see them.\n\n711\n00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:02.610\n>> Okay, a little behind the curve then.\n\n712\n00:36:02.610 --> 00:36:04.676\n>> Well, not paying attention,\nit's your style.\n\n713\n00:36:04.676 --> 00:36:06.092\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n714\n00:36:06.092 --> 00:36:08.310\n>> All right, so it's installing,\n\n715\n00:36:08.310 --> 00:36:09.800\nnow while it's installing.\n\n716\n00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:12.940\nWe are installing GNOME and X Windows.\n\n717\n00:36:12.940 --> 00:36:15.950\nNow we could stop right there and\nwe have GNOME.\n\n718\n00:36:15.950 --> 00:36:19.640\nBut I mentioned we could install\nmultiple desktop managers if we wanted.\n\n719\n00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:21.820\nI mean not desktop, well you can.\n\n720\n00:36:21.820 --> 00:36:24.720\nBut you can install multiple\nwindow managers if we want.\n\n721\n00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:28.640\nSo I could have Gnome and KDE and Xfce so\n\n722\n00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:30.840\nwe could have several of\nthese if we really wanted.\n\n723\n00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:32.520\nAnd so\nthat's what I want to show you guys.\n\n724\n00:36:32.520 --> 00:36:36.210\nI want to show you guys how we can get\nmore than one of those in place, too.\n\n725\n00:36:36.210 --> 00:36:40.340\nBut before I do all that,\nwe'll see this working in an action first.\n\n726\n00:36:40.340 --> 00:36:43.760\nThere it goes doing xorg and notice\nthe drivers, you can see some of them that\n\n727\n00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:47.850\nare going across there vmware,\nand I think I saw ATI in there.\n\n728\n00:36:47.850 --> 00:36:51.110\nSo you'll see a couple of those drivers\ncoming through as it gets them ready.\n\n729\n00:36:51.110 --> 00:36:55.160\nAll these are important packages, you\nknow, and most of them aren't very big.\n\n730\n00:36:55.160 --> 00:36:58.460\nNautilus, Nautilus is the file\nmanager inside of GNOME.\n\n731\n00:36:58.460 --> 00:37:00.100\nSo, when you're browsing\nthrough your folders and\n\n732\n00:37:00.100 --> 00:37:03.540\nstuff that's actually Nautilus that\nyou're using and then other stuff.\n\n733\n00:37:03.540 --> 00:37:07.090\nNothing too terribly\nexciting on this screen,\n\n734\n00:37:07.090 --> 00:37:09.599\norca, we're gonna be talking\nabout orca a little bit later.\n\n735\n00:37:09.599 --> 00:37:12.440\nThat's a screen reader for\naccessibility options.\n\n736\n00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:13.740\nSo, those are getting installed.\n\n737\n00:37:13.740 --> 00:37:16.630\nPulse audio, that's the audio player,\neverything that's responsible for\n\n738\n00:37:16.630 --> 00:37:21.520\nsounds inside of X Windows and\nseveral of the other ones.\n\n739\n00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:23.330\nGok, that's the on-screen keyboard.\n\n740\n00:37:23.330 --> 00:37:24.410\nWe're gonna talk about it later, too.\n\n741\n00:37:25.710 --> 00:37:30.370\nWhich used to be an accessibility option\njust for people who needed that, but\n\n742\n00:37:30.370 --> 00:37:31.980\nnow it's used on tablets a lot.\n\n743\n00:37:31.980 --> 00:37:37.280\nYou might have a tablet with no keyboard,\nso the onscreen keyboard is necessary.\n\n744\n00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:41.320\n>> Scrolling up there,\nI see Wacom express keys scroll up there.\n\n745\n00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:46.418\nI guess as far as drivers and things,\nit's not like reading your hardware and\n\n746\n00:37:46.418 --> 00:37:51.141\npulling only what it needs, but\njust everything within that package.\n\n747\n00:37:51.141 --> 00:37:56.910\n>> Yeah it is a little bit\nwasteful I guess, in that sense.\n\n748\n00:37:56.910 --> 00:38:00.225\nI can see it just installed\nthe Thai scalable fonts, right?\n\n749\n00:38:00.225 --> 00:38:03.000\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'm not running a Thai localization so\n\n750\n00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:03.960\nI don't really need that.\n\n751\n00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:06.010\nThat is a negative of using\nsome of these packages.\n\n752\n00:38:06.010 --> 00:38:09.600\nAnd we can always go and remove the\nindividual ones if we don't need them, but\n\n753\n00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:11.340\nit does do a little overkill.\n\n754\n00:38:11.340 --> 00:38:13.870\nSo, it should almost be done.\n\n755\n00:38:13.870 --> 00:38:14.780\nYeah, there it goes verifying.\n\n756\n00:38:15.930 --> 00:38:17.330\nAnd now, I have a GUI.\n\n757\n00:38:17.330 --> 00:38:18.090\nIt's wonderful isn't it?\n\n758\n00:38:18.090 --> 00:38:19.290\nIt's so easy to navigate.\n\n759\n00:38:19.290 --> 00:38:22.760\nSo, here's the thing.\n\n760\n00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:26.920\nI did a basic install and so\nit's expecting a command line interface.\n\n761\n00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:30.120\nJust because I installed a GUI\ndoesn't mean it's going to use it.\n\n762\n00:38:30.120 --> 00:38:32.480\nIt's got it, I could fire it up.\n\n763\n00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:35.210\nWell, we are going to\nsee some weird things.\n\n764\n00:38:35.210 --> 00:38:36.760\nX Windows is installed.\n\n765\n00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:38.300\nAnd I could fire it up if I wanted.\n\n766\n00:38:38.300 --> 00:38:41.910\nNow I am logged in as root,and so\nI really shouldn't fire it up directly.\n\n767\n00:38:41.910 --> 00:38:44.420\nI guess I could,\nit wouldn't be the end of the world.\n\n768\n00:38:44.420 --> 00:38:48.249\nBut I if I try, well here,\nlet's see, I'll see if it complains.\n\n769\n00:38:49.260 --> 00:38:52.480\nX windows has a very simple\nexecutable called X.\n\n770\n00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:54.310\nNow you're not suppose to run directly.\n\n771\n00:38:54.310 --> 00:38:59.230\nI'm going to, just to see what it does,\nand let's see if it actually works for me.\n\n772\n00:38:59.230 --> 00:39:03.330\nCuz when you run it directly like that,\nwhen you just run X, it doesn't have any\n\n773\n00:39:03.330 --> 00:39:06.690\nconfig files to load and so\nit usually freaks out and does this.\n\n774\n00:39:06.690 --> 00:39:08.730\nHm, I get a nice black screen.\n\n775\n00:39:08.730 --> 00:39:10.000\nIt's not a black mouse,\n\n776\n00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:11.730\non a black background, with black windows-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n777\n00:39:11.730 --> 00:39:13.420\n>> It's just a completely black screen.\n\n778\n00:39:13.420 --> 00:39:16.180\nAnd that's because X needs config files.\n\n779\n00:39:16.180 --> 00:39:21.420\nIt needs various things to get it set\nto be able to display what we want.\n\n780\n00:39:21.420 --> 00:39:24.675\nAnd had I thought about this more.\n\n781\n00:39:24.675 --> 00:39:28.596\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Normally what you hit is Ctrl + Alt +\n\n782\n00:39:28.596 --> 00:39:29.108\nBackspace.\n\n783\n00:39:29.108 --> 00:39:33.200\nCtrl + Alt + Backspace is a nice little\nshortcut that closes X Windows and\n\n784\n00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:34.640\ngets you out of it.\n\n785\n00:39:34.640 --> 00:39:42.820\nBut I am in VMware and it is\nintercepting my little command there.\n\n786\n00:39:42.820 --> 00:39:45.662\nSo I'm gonna have to go\na little more aggressive.\n\n787\n00:39:45.662 --> 00:39:46.491\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n788\n00:39:46.491 --> 00:39:52.043\n>> [LAUGH] All right, yeah,\nI'm gonna have to force it to reboot.\n\n789\n00:39:52.043 --> 00:39:54.409\nSo normally what you would\ndo on a standard PC is,\n\n790\n00:39:54.409 --> 00:39:56.544\nif you launch it like that and\nit freaks out,\n\n791\n00:39:56.544 --> 00:40:00.055\nCtrl+Alt+Backspace is one of the keys\nthat'll get you out of there.\n\n792\n00:40:00.055 --> 00:40:03.929\nCtrl+Alt+X is another one\nthat can get you out.\n\n793\n00:40:03.929 --> 00:40:08.330\nLet me try that one, Ctrl+Alt+X,\neh, it's not getting me out.\n\n794\n00:40:08.330 --> 00:40:11.780\nA lot of my keyboard shortcuts\nare being intercepted and not working.\n\n795\n00:40:11.780 --> 00:40:17.690\nSo let me force this one to reboot and\nthen I'll be able to read.\n\n796\n00:40:17.690 --> 00:40:20.650\nNow when I reboot,\nactually it's kind of a good point here.\n\n797\n00:40:20.650 --> 00:40:26.180\nWhen I reboot, we're gonna see that it's\nnot going to come back up into a GUI,\n\n798\n00:40:26.180 --> 00:40:27.530\nor at least I don't think it will.\n\n799\n00:40:27.530 --> 00:40:32.050\nAnd when it comes back up,\nit'll come back up into the CLI, and\n\n800\n00:40:32.050 --> 00:40:34.300\nthat'll give us a chance to go in and\nkinda fix the problem.\n\n801\n00:40:34.300 --> 00:40:38.290\nSo I can see right there it's going\ndown for a reboot, and it'll fix itself.\n\n802\n00:40:38.290 --> 00:40:42.599\n>> So if, all right, so let's say\nthat X Window launched normally you\n\n803\n00:40:42.599 --> 00:40:43.457\nknow-\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n804\n00:40:43.457 --> 00:40:47.464\n>> And it wasn't stuck with those keyboard\nshortcuts still close it even though it's\n\n805\n00:40:47.464 --> 00:40:47.988\nnot safe?\n\n806\n00:40:47.988 --> 00:40:51.080\n>> Yeah, those are standard shortcuts and\nthey're there just for that scenario.\n\n807\n00:40:51.080 --> 00:40:54.270\nHere there's a couple of situations where\nyou might have it where you can't see\n\n808\n00:40:54.270 --> 00:40:54.850\nyour screen.\n\n809\n00:40:54.850 --> 00:40:55.870\nThis used to be a problem.\n\n810\n00:40:55.870 --> 00:41:00.300\nI installed X Windows the first time\nback in the 90's and it was a nightmare.\n\n811\n00:41:00.300 --> 00:41:04.880\nIt was super hard to get your video card\nsupported and your display supported.\n\n812\n00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:08.500\nYou had to know all sorts of information\nabout your monitor that the vendors didn't\n\n813\n00:41:08.500 --> 00:41:09.400\nnormally tell you.\n\n814\n00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:12.980\nYou had to know your vertical and\nhorizontal refresh rates and\n\n815\n00:41:12.980 --> 00:41:13.710\nstuff like that.\n\n816\n00:41:13.710 --> 00:41:16.540\nAnd you're lucky if you\ncan get that information.\n\n817\n00:41:16.540 --> 00:41:18.830\nSo that was always a real challenge.\n\n818\n00:41:18.830 --> 00:41:23.710\nIt's become so much easier these days and\nwe can see mine's recovering.\n\n819\n00:41:23.710 --> 00:41:26.474\nSo mine is noticing here\nthat I installed the GUI but\n\n820\n00:41:26.474 --> 00:41:31.300\nI've never gone into it before and so it's\ngiving me this text mode set up utility\n\n821\n00:41:31.300 --> 00:41:34.820\nAnd you'll see this if something\nwent wrong typically, or\n\n822\n00:41:34.820 --> 00:41:37.020\nthe first time you reboot\nafter installing the GUI.\n\n823\n00:41:37.020 --> 00:41:40.950\nI don't actually need any of this stuff so\nI'm just gonna quit out.\n\n824\n00:41:40.950 --> 00:41:46.758\nAnd it will put me back\nto my command prompt.\n\n825\n00:41:46.758 --> 00:41:47.640\nThere we go.\n\n826\n00:41:47.640 --> 00:41:52.250\nSo, no GUI, still just the command\nline interface and I logged in as me.\n\n827\n00:41:52.250 --> 00:41:56.428\nBut, if I switch over to route here,\nI'll see no GUI there either, okay.\n\n828\n00:41:56.428 --> 00:41:59.147\nNow, I mentioned when I\nsupposed to run X directly and\n\n829\n00:41:59.147 --> 00:42:01.310\nthen I did it anyway just to show you.\n\n830\n00:42:01.310 --> 00:42:04.700\nWhat we're supposed to run is startx.\n\n831\n00:42:04.700 --> 00:42:10.230\nstartx is actually a script that runs,\nand it prepares X Windows.\n\n832\n00:42:10.230 --> 00:42:13.630\nIt gives it information about your\nmonitor, about your video card, and\n\n833\n00:42:13.630 --> 00:42:16.700\nthis was a huge advancement\nover the old way.\n\n834\n00:42:16.700 --> 00:42:18.540\nIt used to be, I used to dread it.\n\n835\n00:42:18.540 --> 00:42:22.150\nI used to dread setting up X Windows on a\nnew system cuz of all the stuff you had to\n\n836\n00:42:22.150 --> 00:42:23.480\ndo to get supported.\n\n837\n00:42:23.480 --> 00:42:25.650\nBut today is a new world, right.\n\n838\n00:42:25.650 --> 00:42:28.200\nI can't remember the last time\nI had a problem with X windows.\n\n839\n00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:30.880\nNormally they just fire up and\nit works right out of the box.\n\n840\n00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:34.702\nIt's really cool but\nI still remember those keyboard shortcuts.\n\n841\n00:42:34.702 --> 00:42:37.620\nCtrl+Alt+Backspace, Ctrl+Alt+X and\n\n842\n00:42:37.620 --> 00:42:42.600\nthe other ones are control,\nwe use Ctrl +Alt+Plus and Ctrl+Alt+Minus.\n\n843\n00:42:42.600 --> 00:42:45.990\nIf it comes up in a resolution that's\nnot supported in your monitor, plus or\n\n844\n00:42:45.990 --> 00:42:48.970\nminus will move you to higher\nresolution and lower resolutions so\n\n845\n00:42:48.970 --> 00:42:51.570\nyou can do it without having\naccess to control panel.\n\n846\n00:42:51.570 --> 00:42:53.880\nCuz you might not be able to do\nthat if you can't see your screen,\n\n847\n00:42:53.880 --> 00:42:55.360\nif your screen's all garbled up.\n\n848\n00:42:55.360 --> 00:42:59.510\nSo those are some nice little short cuts\nwe can use to try and fix it, all right.\n\n849\n00:42:59.510 --> 00:43:00.910\nNow if I run startx right now,\n\n850\n00:43:00.910 --> 00:43:03.800\nit's gonna be a little angry\nwith me because I'm root.\n\n851\n00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:08.280\nAnd root really shouldn't be running\na GUI and so here we get that message.\n\n852\n00:43:08.280 --> 00:43:11.330\nYou are currently trying to\nrun as the root super user,\n\n853\n00:43:11.330 --> 00:43:15.140\nit's a specialized account, and\nnot designed for normal operation.\n\n854\n00:43:15.140 --> 00:43:16.390\nYou shouldn't be using it.\n\n855\n00:43:16.390 --> 00:43:18.400\nOkay, but I went ahead and\n\n856\n00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:21.220\nlaunched it this way just to\nmake sure that it was cool.\n\n857\n00:43:21.220 --> 00:43:23.220\nAnd I can see that there's my GUI.\n\n858\n00:43:23.220 --> 00:43:24.660\nIt is functional.\n\n859\n00:43:24.660 --> 00:43:26.210\nIt is there, all right?\n\n860\n00:43:26.210 --> 00:43:30.840\nSo huge difference between running the X\nbinary directly versus running startx.\n\n861\n00:43:30.840 --> 00:43:34.860\nstartx actually gathered information\nabout my system, including what\n\n862\n00:43:34.860 --> 00:43:38.260\nvideo card driver I can use, which is a\npretty handy piece of information to have.\n\n863\n00:43:38.260 --> 00:43:39.370\n>> Mm, so don't know it.\n\n864\n00:43:39.370 --> 00:43:41.240\nNow you mentioned that to run this,\n\n865\n00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:46.670\nwe would need some config files\nto be typed up or whatnot.\n\n866\n00:43:46.670 --> 00:43:49.520\nSo, we're running it, but\nyet, no config files.\n\n867\n00:43:49.520 --> 00:43:51.290\n>> So, it generated them for us, right?\n\n868\n00:43:51.290 --> 00:43:52.600\nThat's the cool thing.\n\n869\n00:43:52.600 --> 00:43:54.300\nYeah, and if we wanna see them, we can.\n\n870\n00:43:54.300 --> 00:43:55.470\nLet me get out of here.\n\n871\n00:43:55.470 --> 00:43:56.790\nNow this is going to be a little weird.\n\n872\n00:43:57.910 --> 00:44:02.430\nWe didn't start the GUI at boot time,\nso when I go here to like system and\n\n873\n00:44:02.430 --> 00:44:06.790\nshut down this will actually shutdown,\nwell here watch.\n\n874\n00:44:06.790 --> 00:44:10.735\nIf I choose shutdown, if we take it\nit's going to shut down the X server.\n\n875\n00:44:10.735 --> 00:44:13.075\nSo there it goes shutting\ndown the X server.\n\n876\n00:44:13.075 --> 00:44:17.395\nAnd it's not actually gonna shut down\nmy system or at least it shouldn't.\n\n877\n00:44:17.395 --> 00:44:19.047\nAnd it will drop me back to a prompt.\n\n878\n00:44:19.047 --> 00:44:21.282\nIt did actually shut my system down,\ngod damn it.\n\n879\n00:44:21.282 --> 00:44:25.162\nSo normally it won't actually shut the\nsystem down because I launched it after\n\n880\n00:44:25.162 --> 00:44:25.832\nI was logged in.\n\n881\n00:44:25.832 --> 00:44:28.832\nA lot of times it'll drop you back to\nthe prompt but it didn't in my case.\n\n882\n00:44:28.832 --> 00:44:31.137\n>> So it would be like\nshutting down its own process.\n\n883\n00:44:31.137 --> 00:44:33.478\n>> Mm-hm,\nthat's what you'll typically see.\n\n884\n00:44:33.478 --> 00:44:34.970\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n885\n00:44:34.970 --> 00:44:36.980\n>> All right but\nyou mentioned those config files.\n\n886\n00:44:36.980 --> 00:44:40.248\nSo we didn't create them,\nstartx created them for us.\n\n887\n00:44:40.248 --> 00:44:42.170\nIt saw that this was the first\ntime that we launch and\n\n888\n00:44:42.170 --> 00:44:45.190\nhad built the files that we needed and\nput them in place.\n\n889\n00:44:45.190 --> 00:44:48.625\nAnd we can see them, there's spread\nout in a few different places.\n\n890\n00:44:48.625 --> 00:44:52.515\nIf your system just happened\nto be super lucky and\n\n891\n00:44:52.515 --> 00:44:55.095\nmatch like every default\nsetting possible and\n\n892\n00:44:55.095 --> 00:44:59.290\nnothing had to be change it is possible\nthat it didn't create the files.\n\n893\n00:44:59.290 --> 00:45:01.160\nBut it's pretty rare, right?\n\n894\n00:45:01.160 --> 00:45:06.330\nSo normally we can see where it's\ncreated files in a few different places.\n\n895\n00:45:06.330 --> 00:45:10.640\nIn etc we should have a folder in there\ncalled error folder in there called X11,\n\n896\n00:45:10.640 --> 00:45:14.020\nand I can see it right there,\nand if I go into X11.\n\n897\n00:45:14.020 --> 00:45:16.848\nI'll see that I've got some files in here.\n\n898\n00:45:16.848 --> 00:45:20.952\nThe most important one being\nthat directory right there,\n\n899\n00:45:20.952 --> 00:45:23.060\nxorg.conf.d, all right?\n\n900\n00:45:23.060 --> 00:45:30.000\nAnd if we go into that and\ntake a look, mine is empty.\n\n901\n00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:31.700\nI guess cuz I'm in a virtual machine so\n\n902\n00:45:31.700 --> 00:45:36.740\nmaybe I didn't meet all of the\nrequirements, but we'll see in a minimum\n\n903\n00:45:36.740 --> 00:45:41.500\nof file called prefdm which is\nthe preferred desktop manager.\n\n904\n00:45:41.500 --> 00:45:43.960\nAnd the desktop manager is\nwhat's launching X Windows and\n\n905\n00:45:43.960 --> 00:45:46.510\ngetting the configs in place,\nand I can see I do have that one.\n\n906\n00:45:49.060 --> 00:45:50.790\nAnd so we can see it right there.\n\n907\n00:45:50.790 --> 00:45:54.933\nThere's just a simple little script that\nruns when we go to launch X Windows.\n\n908\n00:45:54.933 --> 00:45:59.904\nSets the path, goes out and finds out\nwhich Window manager we're gonna be using,\n\n909\n00:45:59.904 --> 00:46:03.260\nor display manager so\nyou got GNOME, KDE, WDM, XDM.\n\n910\n00:46:03.260 --> 00:46:07.480\nA few of the different display\nmanagers that it can pick from.\n\n911\n00:46:07.480 --> 00:46:10.780\nBased on whatever desktop\nwe're going to be using.\n\n912\n00:46:10.780 --> 00:46:12.370\nEven though I don't have KDE installed,\n\n913\n00:46:12.370 --> 00:46:13.920\nit's got that little\nentry in there to say,\n\n914\n00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:18.700\nif we do install KDE, we can switch that\ndesktop manager if we wanted, all right?\n\n915\n00:46:18.700 --> 00:46:21.810\nAnd then here's where you'll start to\nsee information about it executing.\n\n916\n00:46:21.810 --> 00:46:26.700\nSo, it's actually running GDM, the GNOME\ndesktop manager, and calling the services.\n\n917\n00:46:26.700 --> 00:46:28.940\nYou'll see a whole lot\nof information in here.\n\n918\n00:46:28.940 --> 00:46:31.990\nSome of it I guess a little\nbit cryptic [LAUGH] as it\n\n919\n00:46:31.990 --> 00:46:33.930\nhandles it's redirections or whatever.\n\n920\n00:46:33.930 --> 00:46:37.836\nBut we'll see that\ninformation right in there.\n\n921\n00:46:37.836 --> 00:46:38.596\n>> Nice.\n\n922\n00:46:38.596 --> 00:46:42.296\n>> So that's a key one to go and check\nout, make sure that your display manager\n\n923\n00:46:42.296 --> 00:46:46.070\nis entered in there and\nthat you've got the information you need.\n\n924\n00:46:46.070 --> 00:46:48.860\nYou know,\nI do feel like I'm missing something.\n\n925\n00:46:48.860 --> 00:46:51.390\nLet's see, sysconfig.\n\n926\n00:46:51.390 --> 00:46:58.110\nIf we go into /etc/sysconfig\nyou may also have\n\n927\n00:46:58.110 --> 00:47:04.870\na file in here called desktop and,\nlet's see, I apparently don't have one.\n\n928\n00:47:04.870 --> 00:47:11.060\nBut, desktop is another file so\nit would be /etc/sysconfig/desktop.\n\n929\n00:47:11.060 --> 00:47:13.370\nAnd, that's a great place\nto put in overrides,\n\n930\n00:47:13.370 --> 00:47:16.980\nif you wanna override\nthe behavior of X Windows or\n\n931\n00:47:16.980 --> 00:47:22.000\nanything like that, it's a config file\nthat is specifically for that purpose.\n\n932\n00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:25.386\nSo, I don't think I have any examples\nof what we would do there but\n\n933\n00:47:25.386 --> 00:47:32.860\nyou'll see various people, it seems like I\nmade an example If I wanted to force it.\n\n934\n00:47:32.860 --> 00:47:38.370\nSo maybe I've installed KDE but I wanna\nforce it to use GDM all the time, right?\n\n935\n00:47:38.370 --> 00:47:41.480\nSo, use the GNOME display\nmanager to fire up and\n\n936\n00:47:41.480 --> 00:47:45.560\nthen people can choose to go KDE and\nit'll switch them over to KDE fine.\n\n937\n00:47:45.560 --> 00:47:47.820\nBut GDM is the one that's\ngonna run under the hood.\n\n938\n00:47:47.820 --> 00:47:51.140\nIf I want to force that,\nI could put that right into display.\n\n939\n00:47:51.140 --> 00:47:56.149\nSo I could just do vi ./display, and\nI could put in some entries in here.\n\n940\n00:47:56.149 --> 00:48:00.462\nI could say, DESKTOP=,\n\n941\n00:48:00.462 --> 00:48:06.742\nlet's do Gnome, got to do my quotes.\n\n942\n00:48:06.742 --> 00:48:11.099\nSo I'll say DESKTOP = \"Gnome\", and\n\n943\n00:48:11.099 --> 00:48:16.020\nthen I'll say DISPLAYMANAGER=\"GDM\".\n\n944\n00:48:16.020 --> 00:48:20.260\nAll right so by a hard setting that\nlike that, hard setting the desk top and\n\n945\n00:48:20.260 --> 00:48:23.430\nhard setting the display manager,\nnow people aren't gonna have the choice.\n\n946\n00:48:23.430 --> 00:48:25.360\nEven if I install a KDM or\n\n947\n00:48:25.360 --> 00:48:29.920\nI mean KDE, it's still going\nto use GDM and Gnome right?\n\n948\n00:48:29.920 --> 00:48:31.970\nSo they're always gonna\nget that one desktop.\n\n949\n00:48:31.970 --> 00:48:34.080\nThat's useful if you have\nmore than one root user, and\n\n950\n00:48:34.080 --> 00:48:36.610\nyou want to prevent people\nfrom switching desktops.\n\n951\n00:48:36.610 --> 00:48:39.210\nIf they're a root user,\nthey're gonna do what they want anyway.\n\n952\n00:48:39.210 --> 00:48:40.920\nBut you can at least annoy them.\n\n953\n00:48:40.920 --> 00:48:43.340\nSo there's that,\nwe can hard set these things.\n\n954\n00:48:43.340 --> 00:48:46.395\nOtherwise, the system just detects it,\nand that's what we normally want, so\n\n955\n00:48:46.395 --> 00:48:48.485\nthat's like what I would want.\n\n956\n00:48:48.485 --> 00:48:53.135\n>> So then if you have multiple like\nKDE and Gnome installed on there,\n\n957\n00:48:53.135 --> 00:48:57.035\nis there a menu to switch between\nthe two like grub or something?\n\n958\n00:48:57.035 --> 00:48:58.085\n>> Yeah, let me show you that.\n\n959\n00:48:58.085 --> 00:49:02.670\nRight, so right now, actually, before\nI do that, let me do one more thing.\n\n960\n00:49:02.670 --> 00:49:06.830\nWhen I reboot right now, it took me\nto the command line interface, and\n\n961\n00:49:06.830 --> 00:49:10.060\nthat's because I haven't told\nthe system we've got a GUI.\n\n962\n00:49:10.060 --> 00:49:13.140\nRemember from an earlier episode,\nwe talked about run levels and\n\n963\n00:49:13.140 --> 00:49:18.360\nhow in CentOS run level 3 is full\nmulti-user with a text based interface and\n\n964\n00:49:18.360 --> 00:49:25.280\nrun level five was a full multi-user run\nlevel with a graphical user interface.\n\n965\n00:49:25.280 --> 00:49:29.660\nI need to tell my system to start in\nrun level 5 every time it boots now so\n\n966\n00:49:29.660 --> 00:49:31.170\nit knows to go to the GUI.\n\n967\n00:49:31.170 --> 00:49:35.670\nOtherwise I'm gonna have to launch X\nmyself every time and that gets annoying.\n\n968\n00:49:35.670 --> 00:49:39.210\nSo let's make that change real quick and\nthen I'll show you how to install.\n\n969\n00:49:39.210 --> 00:49:41.410\nWe'll install multiple window managers and\n\n970\n00:49:41.410 --> 00:49:45.220\nI'll show you that menu where people\ncould pick, it's pretty cool.\n\n971\n00:49:45.220 --> 00:49:49.970\nSo the first thing I need to do is,\nif I wanna fix the boot up to\n\n972\n00:49:49.970 --> 00:49:55.170\nGUI is I need to modify my\ninitialization table, my inittab.\n\n973\n00:49:55.170 --> 00:50:00.368\nSo I'm gonna edit /etc/inittab.\n\n974\n00:50:00.368 --> 00:50:03.750\nAnd we looked at this one\nin an earlier episode.\n\n975\n00:50:03.750 --> 00:50:07.540\nAnd see down there at the bottom,\nit's set to boot up into run level 3.\n\n976\n00:50:07.540 --> 00:50:11.640\nAnd run level 3 is a text based interface,\nright?\n\n977\n00:50:11.640 --> 00:50:14.480\nSo I'm going to just mark that one out.\n\n978\n00:50:14.480 --> 00:50:16.020\nOr comment it out.\n\n979\n00:50:16.020 --> 00:50:19.522\nAnd add my own line that says, there.\n\n980\n00:50:19.522 --> 00:50:20.842\nid:5:initdefault:.\n\n981\n00:50:20.842 --> 00:50:24.115\nI could have just changed the 3 to a 5 but\n\n982\n00:50:24.115 --> 00:50:30.110\nI always like to leave the default\nthere so I can remember what it was.\n\n983\n00:50:30.110 --> 00:50:31.530\nWhat was that default?\n\n984\n00:50:31.530 --> 00:50:32.960\nWell, now I've got it right there.\n\n985\n00:50:32.960 --> 00:50:36.910\nSo now I'm telling when it boots up\nto boot up into X Windows, right.\n\n986\n00:50:36.910 --> 00:50:41.380\nBoot into Xorg and\nactually give me a GUI, all right.\n\n987\n00:50:41.380 --> 00:50:42.830\nSo I'll save that.\n\n988\n00:50:42.830 --> 00:50:44.850\nNow, we installed Gnome.\n\n989\n00:50:44.850 --> 00:50:47.150\nWe installed the font packages.\n\n990\n00:50:47.150 --> 00:50:49.680\nWe installed the desktop applications.\n\n991\n00:50:49.680 --> 00:50:51.400\nSo what if I want other window managers?\n\n992\n00:50:51.400 --> 00:50:53.050\nI can add them, right.\n\n993\n00:50:53.050 --> 00:51:01.220\nSo I can do yum\ngroupinstall \"KDE Desktop\".\n\n994\n00:51:01.220 --> 00:51:03.290\nIs that lower case D, let's find out.\n\n995\n00:51:03.290 --> 00:51:05.910\nI can't remember if it's a capital or\nlower case D in the group name.\n\n996\n00:51:05.910 --> 00:51:06.510\nIt might not matter.\n\n997\n00:51:08.580 --> 00:51:10.786\nLet's see if it comes back, that was it.\n\n998\n00:51:10.786 --> 00:51:16.515\nOkay so here's KDE, a quick 120 packages,\nthis ones a little bit on the big side.\n\n999\n00:51:16.515 --> 00:51:18.472\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\ninstall KDE and get that one in.\n\n1000\n00:51:18.472 --> 00:51:20.722\nNow I'm using CentOS.\n\n1001\n00:51:20.722 --> 00:51:24.807\nAnd the guys at Red Hat, you know,\nCentOS is based on Red Hat.\n\n1002\n00:51:24.807 --> 00:51:28.348\nThey've chose to support Gnome,\nand KDE, and that's it.\n\n1003\n00:51:28.348 --> 00:51:33.690\nSo, those are the two Window managers\nthat are a part of that distribution.\n\n1004\n00:51:33.690 --> 00:51:35.740\nSo, if I want one of those, great.\n\n1005\n00:51:35.740 --> 00:51:37.300\nThat'll work fine, I can run with it.\n\n1006\n00:51:38.420 --> 00:51:42.840\nBut, if I want a different window manager,\nwell.\n\n1007\n00:51:42.840 --> 00:51:44.480\nI'm not out of luck, I can do it.\n\n1008\n00:51:44.480 --> 00:51:46.310\nIt's just not gonna be easy as this.\n\n1009\n00:51:46.310 --> 00:51:48.820\nI can't just go and\npull right out of their repositories.\n\n1010\n00:51:48.820 --> 00:51:50.940\n'Cuz it's missing the files that I want.\n\n1011\n00:51:50.940 --> 00:51:53.670\nSo, while that's installing,\nI'm gonna jump over to.\n\n1012\n00:51:53.670 --> 00:51:54.670\nNo, the day is gonna be like.\n\n1013\n00:51:54.670 --> 00:51:55.190\nIt won't let me do it.\n\n1014\n00:51:55.190 --> 00:51:57.808\nI was gonna say, I was gonna go and\ninstall it in another window.\n\n1015\n00:51:57.808 --> 00:52:00.340\nI guess I can do some of\nthe prep work in another window.\n\n1016\n00:52:00.340 --> 00:52:07.680\nLet me jump over to one of my other TTYs,\nand we'll do some of the prep work, right?\n\n1017\n00:52:07.680 --> 00:52:11.390\nIf I wanna install Xfce, I mentioned\nthat's one of my favorites, well,\n\n1018\n00:52:11.390 --> 00:52:13.490\nRed Hat chose not to\nsupport that one anymore.\n\n1019\n00:52:13.490 --> 00:52:15.020\nI'm very sad about that.\n\n1020\n00:52:15.020 --> 00:52:18.250\nBut we can still get it through\na third party repository.\n\n1021\n00:52:18.250 --> 00:52:22.980\nThere is the E-P-E-L or EPEL repository.\n\n1022\n00:52:22.980 --> 00:52:28.807\nIt's a collection of ports for Enterprise\nLinux that, for Red Head Enterprise Linux,\n\n1023\n00:52:28.807 --> 00:52:33.450\nthat Red Hat has chosen not to support but\nthe Open source community has\n\n1024\n00:52:33.450 --> 00:52:38.190\nchosen TO support and Xfce is in there and\nI can pull it from there.\n\n1025\n00:52:38.190 --> 00:52:43.100\nSo, if I wanna do Xfce,\nI need to add that repository first.\n\n1026\n00:52:43.100 --> 00:52:44.380\nLet me see if I have wget.\n\n1027\n00:52:44.380 --> 00:52:45.400\nI do.\nAll right, so\n\n1028\n00:52:45.400 --> 00:52:48.430\nI'm gonna install that repository\nreal quick on my system.\n\n1029\n00:52:48.430 --> 00:52:51.620\nAnd I'll post how to do this with the show\nnotes if any of you guys feel like doing\n\n1030\n00:52:51.620 --> 00:52:56.380\nit, but\nI'm just gonna get that one in here.\n\n1031\n00:52:56.380 --> 00:53:01.294\nIt's actually a part of Fedora, so\nit's not in their mainstream OS,\n\n1032\n00:53:01.294 --> 00:53:06.056\nbut it is in their research OS in Fedora,\nso I'll get it from there.\n\n1033\n00:53:06.056 --> 00:53:07.681\nEPEL.\n\n1034\n00:53:07.681 --> 00:53:08.722\nI don't have this memorized,\n\n1035\n00:53:08.722 --> 00:53:10.795\nI actually have it written on\na piece of paper here beside me.\n\n1036\n00:53:10.795 --> 00:53:13.840\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That helps out a little bit.\n\n1037\n00:53:13.840 --> 00:53:15.810\nSometimes, people assume I\nhave this stuff memorized.\n\n1038\n00:53:15.810 --> 00:53:18.875\n>> Yeah, they're like, man,\nDon, you're pretty hardcore.\n\n1039\n00:53:18.875 --> 00:53:22.405\n[LAUGH]\n>> Not as smart as you might think.\n\n1040\n00:53:22.405 --> 00:53:24.306\n[LAUGH] All Right, so.\n\n1041\n00:53:27.514 --> 00:53:28.750\nAnd there we go, okay.\n\n1042\n00:53:28.750 --> 00:53:32.480\nSo I just reached down and downloaded\nan RPM package and this is not Xfce.\n\n1043\n00:53:32.480 --> 00:53:36.320\nThis is adding this extra repository,\nso I just got the RPM for that.\n\n1044\n00:53:36.320 --> 00:53:40.713\nAnd I'm gonna install it real quick, so\n\n1045\n00:53:40.713 --> 00:53:45.764\nI'm doing a,\nan out of band package install.\n\n1046\n00:53:47.513 --> 00:53:49.222\nAll right.\n\n1047\n00:53:49.222 --> 00:53:53.235\nNow I can say, well, probably not\nwhile the other one's installing.\n\n1048\n00:53:53.235 --> 00:53:58.205\nBut now I can say yum groupinstall \"Xfce\"\nand, while that didn't exist before,\n\n1049\n00:53:58.205 --> 00:53:58.990\nnow it does.\n\n1050\n00:53:58.990 --> 00:54:02.150\nBecause that repository has it,\nand I'll be able to see it.\n\n1051\n00:54:02.150 --> 00:54:05.570\nLet me go see what the status\nis of my other install.\n\n1052\n00:54:05.570 --> 00:54:08.300\nIt is crawling along.\n\n1053\n00:54:08.300 --> 00:54:11.560\n>> Now you did say that\nKDE was a bit more,\n\n1054\n00:54:11.560 --> 00:54:14.360\nbit more heavier than with Gnome, correct?\n\n1055\n00:54:14.360 --> 00:54:15.500\n>> That is true.\n\n1056\n00:54:15.500 --> 00:54:16.505\n>> A bit more involved?\n\n1057\n00:54:16.505 --> 00:54:18.990\n>> Well, why don't we do this?\n\n1058\n00:54:18.990 --> 00:54:23.450\nWe're just kinda waiting on it,\nwe could stop here and\n\n1059\n00:54:23.450 --> 00:54:27.390\ntake a break and then when we get back,\nhopefully that'll be done.\n\n1060\n00:54:27.390 --> 00:54:31.040\nI'll install the Xfce after that.\n\n1061\n00:54:31.040 --> 00:54:33.470\nIt seems to be stalled.\n\n1062\n00:54:33.470 --> 00:54:34.750\nNo, it's copying along.\n\n1063\n00:54:34.750 --> 00:54:38.800\nIt's got an eta of 361 minutes,\nthat's not, that's not awesome.\n\n1064\n00:54:38.800 --> 00:54:41.498\nSo it's the KDE games package,\nwhich I care about.\n\n1065\n00:54:41.498 --> 00:54:42.482\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n1066\n00:54:42.482 --> 00:54:45.280\n>> So, yeah,\nwe might have a problem there.\n\n1067\n00:54:45.280 --> 00:54:46.440\n>> Right.\n\n1068\n00:54:46.440 --> 00:54:48.931\nSo, it comes like chocked full of games,\ntoo?\n\n1069\n00:54:48.931 --> 00:54:51.470\n>> It's copying at a blazing\n2 kilobytes per second..\n\n1070\n00:54:51.470 --> 00:54:55.681\nThat's awesome.\n\n1071\n00:54:55.681 --> 00:54:57.264\nIt's like I'm downloading on a modem here.\n\n1072\n00:54:57.264 --> 00:55:00.490\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Great, all right, well, let's do this.\n\n1073\n00:55:00.490 --> 00:55:02.265\nLet's stop and take a break.\n\n1074\n00:55:02.265 --> 00:55:04.910\nWhen we get back, hopefully this\nwill be finished installing.\n\n1075\n00:55:04.910 --> 00:55:10.120\nI'll add Xfce and when that's done,\nwe'll reboot, we'll come up in our GUI and\n\n1076\n00:55:10.120 --> 00:55:14.120\nwe'll see a menu where we can\npick between the different GUIs.\n\n1077\n00:55:14.120 --> 00:55:15.190\nIt'll be awesome.\n\n1078\n00:55:15.190 --> 00:55:16.230\n>> Can't wait.\n\n1079\n00:55:16.230 --> 00:55:17.230\n>> Stay tuned.\n\n1080\n00:55:17.230 --> 00:55:18.222\nWe'll be back after this.\n\n1081\n00:55:18.222 --> 00:55:22.597\n[MUSIC]\n\n1082\n00:55:22.597 --> 00:55:25.972\n[NOISE] All right.\n\n1083\n00:55:25.972 --> 00:55:27.430\nWelcome back everybody.\n\n1084\n00:55:27.430 --> 00:55:30.490\nSo during the break,\nit finished installing KDE.\n\n1085\n00:55:30.490 --> 00:55:32.210\nI had to use a little trick.\n\n1086\n00:55:32.210 --> 00:55:34.880\nWhich is,\nif you ever have an install that stalls.\n\n1087\n00:55:34.880 --> 00:55:39.310\nOurs was going at two kilobytes\nper second, which is ridiculous.\n\n1088\n00:55:39.310 --> 00:55:43.550\nYou can hit CTRL+C once and\nit'll abandon the download and restart it.\n\n1089\n00:55:43.550 --> 00:55:47.108\nAnd so mine jumped to another mirror and\nthen downloaded nice and fast.\n\n1090\n00:55:47.108 --> 00:55:50.135\nIf you CTRL+C twice,\nit'll actually abort the install and\n\n1091\n00:55:50.135 --> 00:55:53.830\nroll back all the packages, so\nCTRL+C is kind of a handy shortcut there.\n\n1092\n00:55:53.830 --> 00:55:58.835\nBut at this point, we've installed\nGnome and now we've installed KDE, and\n\n1093\n00:55:58.835 --> 00:56:04.084\nI set the groundwork for installing Xfce,\nso that's the one I'm gonna add now.\n\n1094\n00:56:04.084 --> 00:56:08.087\nI'm gonna go ahead and\ndo a group install for XFCE and so\n\n1095\n00:56:08.087 --> 00:56:12.290\nwhen I do that,\nit's gonna reach out and find that.\n\n1096\n00:56:12.290 --> 00:56:14.960\nIt wouldn't normally find\nthis because it's not\n\n1097\n00:56:14.960 --> 00:56:17.800\nin the Red Hat approved repository.\n\n1098\n00:56:17.800 --> 00:56:19.874\nBut it is in EPEL.\n\n1099\n00:56:19.874 --> 00:56:22.041\nIt is an additional\nrepository that I added.\n\n1100\n00:56:22.041 --> 00:56:26.430\nSo, now it find it and\nwe can install XFCE.\n\n1101\n00:56:26.430 --> 00:56:31.920\nNotice XFCE, a whopping 18 meg download,\n58 megs uncompressed.\n\n1102\n00:56:31.920 --> 00:56:34.980\nIt's all about performance and efficiency.\n\n1103\n00:56:34.980 --> 00:56:37.060\nIt's 10% the size of KDE, right?\n\n1104\n00:56:37.060 --> 00:56:39.190\nKDE was 580 megs for us, so.\n\n1105\n00:56:39.190 --> 00:56:42.417\nHuge difference there and\nit will install a whooping 28 packages.\n\n1106\n00:56:42.417 --> 00:56:46.370\nIt also helps that I have a bunch of\npackages already installed from the other\n\n1107\n00:56:46.370 --> 00:56:49.291\nWindow manager, so\nit's maybe not a fair comparison.\n\n1108\n00:56:49.291 --> 00:56:54.196\n>> So Don, when you installed Nona the\nfirst time, you also ran a fonts group,\n\n1109\n00:56:54.196 --> 00:56:57.580\nand then when you ran a KDE,\nyou did not run any font.\n\n1110\n00:56:57.580 --> 00:57:00.105\nSo it uses the same-\n>> They were already there, yeah.\n\n1111\n00:57:00.105 --> 00:57:02.490\nYeah, those fonts are a part of Exon 1 and\nI'm glad you mentioned that,\n\n1112\n00:57:02.490 --> 00:57:06.430\nNate, cuz I almost forgot XFCE it's old.\n\n1113\n00:57:06.430 --> 00:57:10.570\nIt's been around a while and it actually\nuses some slightly different font packs\n\n1114\n00:57:10.570 --> 00:57:13.020\nand so\nI do need to install a few fonts here.\n\n1115\n00:57:13.020 --> 00:57:15.880\nBut KDE, yeah, I didn't install\nthe fonts just cuzI already had.\n\n1116\n00:57:15.880 --> 00:57:18.480\nIf I hadn't, I would have done it,\nyeah, all right.\n\n1117\n00:57:18.480 --> 00:57:24.050\nSo, I am gonna add just a little\nbit more here for good old XFCE.\n\n1118\n00:57:24.050 --> 00:57:29.450\nI need to add the xorg -x11-fonts.\n\n1119\n00:57:30.580 --> 00:57:32.460\nI need to add the Type1 fonts.\n\n1120\n00:57:32.460 --> 00:57:38.832\nAnd I need to add the miscellaneous fonts.\n\n1121\n00:57:38.832 --> 00:57:40.207\nSo, let me just punch those in.\n\n1122\n00:57:40.207 --> 00:57:44.220\nAnd we'll get them,\nit looks like I already had one of them.\n\n1123\n00:57:46.090 --> 00:57:49.420\nYep, so it says that the Type1 fonts\nare already installed and at the latest\n\n1124\n00:57:49.420 --> 00:57:51.570\nversion, so it's a miscellaneous font for\nthe only one that I need.\n\n1125\n00:57:52.730 --> 00:57:55.323\nThat's one of the nice things\nabout dependency checks and yum,\n\n1126\n00:57:55.323 --> 00:57:57.832\nand aptget is they will check\nto see if you've already got it.\n\n1127\n00:57:57.832 --> 00:58:00.249\nSo, there we go.\n\n1128\n00:58:00.249 --> 00:58:04.680\nAll right, so now I've got KDE installed.\n\n1129\n00:58:04.680 --> 00:58:07.760\nI've got XFCE installed and\nI've got Gnome.\n\n1130\n00:58:07.760 --> 00:58:11.540\nMy default is gonna be Gnome cuz\nthat's what send OS defaults do.\n\n1131\n00:58:11.540 --> 00:58:13.270\nBut the users will actually get a choice.\n\n1132\n00:58:13.270 --> 00:58:15.040\nAnd that's what Nate was asking about.\n\n1133\n00:58:15.040 --> 00:58:18.040\nWhat kind of lead us to this in\nthe first place was, do they get a menu?\n\n1134\n00:58:18.040 --> 00:58:19.440\nCan they choose?\n\n1135\n00:58:19.440 --> 00:58:24.221\nI showed you how to force and how to\nuse one by modifying slash, etc, slash,\n\n1136\n00:58:24.221 --> 00:58:26.940\nwas it assist control, slash, desktop?\n\n1137\n00:58:26.940 --> 00:58:30.150\nAnd going in there and modifying it there.\n\n1138\n00:58:30.150 --> 00:58:33.860\nBut if we wanna give them the choice,\nit actually does that for us.\n\n1139\n00:58:33.860 --> 00:58:34.470\nIf I reboot.\n\n1140\n00:58:34.470 --> 00:58:35.819\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nreboot this machine.\n\n1141\n00:58:36.860 --> 00:58:38.120\nSo we'll reboot.\n\n1142\n00:58:38.120 --> 00:58:44.490\nWhen it reboots, we modify our inittab or\nour initialization table or inittab.\n\n1143\n00:58:44.490 --> 00:58:46.290\nSo, we modify that to say to boot up and\n\n1144\n00:58:46.290 --> 00:58:49.910\nto run level five,\nboot up with the GUI, okay?\n\n1145\n00:58:49.910 --> 00:58:53.420\nSo, when it boots,\nit's gonna know to launched a GUI.\n\n1146\n00:58:53.420 --> 00:58:56.622\nAnd it's gonna launch the GDM,\nthe Gnome Display Manager, and\n\n1147\n00:58:56.622 --> 00:58:58.790\nit's gonna give us a login screen.\n\n1148\n00:58:58.790 --> 00:59:01.330\nAnd on that login screen, we should,\n\n1149\n00:59:01.330 --> 00:59:04.780\nunless I mess something up, we should\nsee a little option at the bottom of our\n\n1150\n00:59:04.780 --> 00:59:08.200\nscreen that lets us pick\nwhich window manager we want.\n\n1151\n00:59:08.200 --> 00:59:10.710\nSo some of our users can\nrun one Window manager,\n\n1152\n00:59:10.710 --> 00:59:13.510\nwhile others run a different one, okay?\n\n1153\n00:59:13.510 --> 00:59:14.190\nSo here it is.\n\n1154\n00:59:14.190 --> 00:59:15.300\nI'm at my log-in screen.\n\n1155\n00:59:15.300 --> 00:59:17.320\nIt's listing the various\nusers that I can pick from,\n\n1156\n00:59:17.320 --> 00:59:19.720\nall the ones we've created in the show.\n\n1157\n00:59:19.720 --> 00:59:21.280\nSo I'll pick myself.\n\n1158\n00:59:21.280 --> 00:59:22.458\nAnd so here I go to log-in.\n\n1159\n00:59:22.458 --> 00:59:28.000\nNow, before I hit log-in, notice down\nhere at the bottom, it's set to Gnome.\n\n1160\n00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:34.500\nAnd I can choose from Gnome, KDE,\nor XFCE depending on what I want.\n\n1161\n00:59:34.500 --> 00:59:38.707\nAnd so I could pick KDE,\nand I could log in.\n\n1162\n00:59:38.707 --> 00:59:42.624\nAnd now I'm gonna get my KDE desktop\nagain unless I screwed something up.\n\n1163\n00:59:42.624 --> 00:59:45.140\n[LAUGH] There's always that possibility,\nright?\n\n1164\n00:59:45.140 --> 00:59:49.170\nThere we go.\nSo I've got a nice pretty Katie\n\n1165\n00:59:49.170 --> 00:59:56.750\nenvironment here, and I can come into\nmy own folder, and in my downloads.\n\n1166\n00:59:56.750 --> 01:00:02.640\nIf I create something on my desktop, so\nif I come in here and I create a new file.\n\n1167\n01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:04.380\nSo Don's passwords.\n\n1168\n01:00:04.380 --> 01:00:05.632\nThis is what I like to do,\n\n1169\n01:00:05.632 --> 01:00:09.013\nI save all my passwords just in\na text file right on my desktop.\n\n1170\n01:00:09.013 --> 01:00:10.207\n>> It's easy that way.\n\n1171\n01:00:10.207 --> 01:00:13.365\n>> So yeah, I wanna have\naccess to them quickly, right?\n\n1172\n01:00:13.365 --> 01:00:16.330\nSo here are all my passwords.\n\n1173\n01:00:16.330 --> 01:00:20.110\nAnd sometimes I back them up, so I just\ndo a copy the text file to a USB key and\n\n1174\n01:00:20.110 --> 01:00:20.945\nleave it on the desk.\n\n1175\n01:00:20.945 --> 01:00:23.180\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's my backup plan.\n\n1176\n01:00:23.180 --> 01:00:27.540\nSo any how, so I create that,\nit's right there, it's on my desktop, so\n\n1177\n01:00:27.540 --> 01:00:29.170\nI've got Don's passwords.\n\n1178\n01:00:29.170 --> 01:00:33.069\nAnd if I log out, so\nif I go to leave and I log out.\n\n1179\n01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.090\nI can log out of my system.\n\n1180\n01:00:37.090 --> 01:00:40.260\nI can attempt to log out of my system,\nthat didn't really get very far.\n\n1181\n01:00:40.260 --> 01:00:42.180\nThere we go, I'm being impatient.\n\n1182\n01:00:42.180 --> 01:00:46.310\nI can log out, and when I log back in,\nI can pick a different window manager.\n\n1183\n01:00:46.310 --> 01:00:48.630\nI'm not stuck to that one window manager.\n\n1184\n01:00:48.630 --> 01:00:51.620\nSo I can switch back over to Gnome or\nXFCE.\n\n1185\n01:00:51.620 --> 01:00:53.900\nWhich is my preference.\n\n1186\n01:00:53.900 --> 01:00:56.660\nAnd so I can log in with XFCE and\nhere we go.\n\n1187\n01:00:56.660 --> 01:00:58.880\nIt's letting me know this is\nthe first time I've come in so\n\n1188\n01:00:58.880 --> 01:01:01.400\nI can just use the default config.\n\n1189\n01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:02.000\nHere we are.\n\n1190\n01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:03.499\nAnd notice, there's my passwords, right?\n\n1191\n01:01:03.499 --> 01:01:04.670\nWell, that's a temporary file.\n\n1192\n01:01:04.670 --> 01:01:05.530\nHere's the real one.\n\n1193\n01:01:05.530 --> 01:01:06.590\nSo here's my passwords.\n\n1194\n01:01:06.590 --> 01:01:07.210\nI can go in there.\n\n1195\n01:01:07.210 --> 01:01:08.600\nAll right?\n\n1196\n01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:10.060\nIt's the same home folder.\n\n1197\n01:01:10.060 --> 01:01:11.120\nIt's the same document.\n\n1198\n01:01:11.120 --> 01:01:13.560\nIt's just a different window manager.\n\n1199\n01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:17.610\nSo, the window manager is changed,\nnot my user profile, so\n\n1200\n01:01:17.610 --> 01:01:20.830\nyou can flip between these at your\nleisure, whichever you prefer.\n\n1201\n01:01:21.910 --> 01:01:26.030\nIt's just a matter of logging out and\nlogging back in, and off you go.\n\n1202\n01:01:26.030 --> 01:01:26.581\nSo, let's see.\n\n1203\n01:01:26.581 --> 01:01:31.292\nI did KDE and XFCE,\nnow I'll just switch it to Gnome.\n\n1204\n01:01:32.791 --> 01:01:35.430\nWhich will make the Red Hat guys happy.\n\n1205\n01:01:35.430 --> 01:01:39.340\nAnd now,\nwe see it the way that Red Hat wants this.\n\n1206\n01:01:39.340 --> 01:01:43.600\nAnd so there we go, I've got my\ngood old passwords right there.\n\n1207\n01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:48.080\n>> Now, as far as now, locking it down,\nso there is no option, right?\n\n1208\n01:01:48.080 --> 01:01:51.900\nSo, you must not, or we can do\nthat as well, and lock it down, so\n\n1209\n01:01:51.900 --> 01:01:53.120\nthere is no option?\n\n1210\n01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:54.840\n>> So, you just have the one manager?\n\n1211\n01:01:54.840 --> 01:02:00.920\nYeah, you can go and modify the desktop\nfile that I showed you guys earlier,\n\n1212\n01:02:00.920 --> 01:02:04.430\nthat can override the setting and\nforce you to use one window manager.\n\n1213\n01:02:04.430 --> 01:02:07.875\nThe other option is you can\nset it in the user's profile.\n\n1214\n01:02:07.875 --> 01:02:10.930\nCuz those are just variables that we set,\nright?\n\n1215\n01:02:10.930 --> 01:02:15.874\nSo there was the desktop variable,\nand the desktop manager variable.\n\n1216\n01:02:15.874 --> 01:02:18.460\nAnd if you set those,\nyou can hard set it, and so\n\n1217\n01:02:18.460 --> 01:02:21.706\nyou can put it into the user's\nindividual profile to do it.\n\n1218\n01:02:21.706 --> 01:02:25.695\nPersonally, I just uninstall the window\nmanager's you don't wanna use.\n\n1219\n01:02:25.695 --> 01:02:28.160\nSo, if you don't want people using KDE,\ndon't install it.\n\n1220\n01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:30.020\nAnd if they're not root users,\n\n1221\n01:02:30.020 --> 01:02:32.030\nthen they're not gonna be\nable to add it anyways.\n\n1222\n01:02:32.030 --> 01:02:35.113\nSo that's really the best way to\nhandle it, but you can hard set it.\n\n1223\n01:02:35.113 --> 01:02:39.794\n>> Mm-hm, and then once again,\nwhether it's xorg or Waveland, or\n\n1224\n01:02:39.794 --> 01:02:46.510\nMir on the back end, so I mean they'll all\nlook the same as far as the desktops go.\n\n1225\n01:02:46.510 --> 01:02:49.727\n>> Yeah, well with the exception of\nthe newer ones look a little buggy,\n\n1226\n01:02:49.727 --> 01:02:51.624\ncuz [LAUGH] they're not quite right yet.\n\n1227\n01:02:51.624 --> 01:02:55.410\nBut at the end of the day,\nwhen those products are complete, yes,\n\n1228\n01:02:55.410 --> 01:02:57.041\nthey'll all look the same.\n\n1229\n01:02:57.041 --> 01:02:57.582\n>> All right.\n\n1230\n01:02:57.582 --> 01:03:00.838\n>> All right, now we haven't really\nworked with the GUI much, and\n\n1231\n01:03:00.838 --> 01:03:04.170\nwe're not because it's only 8%\nof this one, the second exam.\n\n1232\n01:03:04.170 --> 01:03:05.374\nIt's such a small part of the exam.\n\n1233\n01:03:05.374 --> 01:03:07.425\nI don't wanna spend a ton of time on it.\n\n1234\n01:03:07.425 --> 01:03:11.635\nBut there are a few neat commands and\na few neat things I do wanna show you.\n\n1235\n01:03:11.635 --> 01:03:15.745\nOne is, we might wanna get some\ninformation about the windows that\n\n1236\n01:03:15.745 --> 01:03:20.125\nare running, and there's a couple of\nX Windows commands that are kind neat.\n\n1237\n01:03:20.125 --> 01:03:24.885\nI'm gonna launch these, depending on your,\nwhoops, depending on your GUI,\n\n1238\n01:03:24.885 --> 01:03:29.325\nyou might have a little run option\nthat you can pull up, or might not.\n\n1239\n01:03:29.325 --> 01:03:31.140\nSome of them h ave it, some of them don't.\n\n1240\n01:03:31.140 --> 01:03:33.550\nBut, I'm gonna run a few commands.\n\n1241\n01:03:33.550 --> 01:03:34.950\nI'll just launch them from a terminal,\n\n1242\n01:03:34.950 --> 01:03:37.600\nwould probably be the easiest\nway to go about this.\n\n1243\n01:03:37.600 --> 01:03:40.583\nI've got all sorts of terminals\nnow cuz I have KDE installed.\n\n1244\n01:03:40.583 --> 01:03:45.110\nBut, one little command that we can use,\nif we're in here and\n\n1245\n01:03:45.110 --> 01:03:50.284\nwe're working, and\nwe're firing up some different programs.\n\n1246\n01:03:50.284 --> 01:03:53.320\nDid I install, I don't have Firefox.\n\n1247\n01:03:53.320 --> 01:03:54.510\nI didn't install Firefox.\n\n1248\n01:03:54.510 --> 01:03:59.650\nIt's not a part of the default stuff,\nbut we do have Konqueror?\n\n1249\n01:03:59.650 --> 01:04:00.800\nYeah, there we go.\n\n1250\n01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:02.752\nKonqueror is the web browser\nthat comes with KDE.\n\n1251\n01:04:02.752 --> 01:04:05.650\nIt's got it's own little web browser,\nif you're into that.\n\n1252\n01:04:07.910 --> 01:04:09.628\nI can fire that up and get to work.\n\n1253\n01:04:09.628 --> 01:04:12.573\nNow if I want to find out information\nabout these windows, cuz these windows\n\n1254\n01:04:12.573 --> 01:04:15.254\nreally are just kind of programs\nthat are running in the background.\n\n1255\n01:04:15.254 --> 01:04:16.857\nAnd, if we run ps or whatever,\n\n1256\n01:04:16.857 --> 01:04:20.955\nwe don't see them because they're\nactually being run by our window manager.\n\n1257\n01:04:20.955 --> 01:04:24.953\nThey're there though, if I were to do\na ps aux, and poke around in there,\n\n1258\n01:04:24.953 --> 01:04:29.225\nyou can see there's my gnome terminal,\nthat's the window I'm in right now.\n\n1259\n01:04:29.225 --> 01:04:33.815\nAnd I can see gnome screensaver and\na bunch of other things that are now\n\n1260\n01:04:33.815 --> 01:04:38.502\nrunning as a part of me being in\na graphical user environment, right?\n\n1261\n01:04:38.502 --> 01:04:41.395\nIt's a lot more processes than we\nnormally have with the CLI and\n\n1262\n01:04:41.395 --> 01:04:43.970\nthat's one of the reasons we\ndon't do this on a server.\n\n1263\n01:04:43.970 --> 01:04:47.249\nServers, you wanna use as few\nresources as possible, so\n\n1264\n01:04:47.249 --> 01:04:49.996\nyou can support as many\ncustomers as possible.\n\n1265\n01:04:49.996 --> 01:04:53.294\nBut on a desktop you're just\nsupporting yourself, right?\n\n1266\n01:04:53.294 --> 01:04:56.471\nSo it's about giving you as\nmany features as you can, so\n\n1267\n01:04:56.471 --> 01:04:59.730\nit's just a different way of\nlooking at things, right?\n\n1268\n01:04:59.730 --> 01:05:02.530\nOne of the commands I wanted\nto show you guys, let's see,\n\n1269\n01:05:02.530 --> 01:05:08.450\nI think they called a few of them out\non the objectives, actually, I don't\n\n1270\n01:05:08.450 --> 01:05:13.790\nreally see any, but I know we've got a\ncouple like xwininfo, which is a neat one.\n\n1271\n01:05:13.790 --> 01:05:15.010\nI'll just use these.\n\n1272\n01:05:15.010 --> 01:05:19.490\nSo if I do xwininfo, it's a cool one\nbecause what it does is you'll see my\n\n1273\n01:05:19.490 --> 01:05:24.680\nmouse changes to a plus sign, and\nit lets me click on a window on my screen,\n\n1274\n01:05:24.680 --> 01:05:26.810\nand it'll give me information about it.\n\n1275\n01:05:26.810 --> 01:05:30.000\nSo, if I click on Conqueror here,\nyou'll see it gives me output.\n\n1276\n01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:31.720\nThe window is called Conqueror.\n\n1277\n01:05:31.720 --> 01:05:33.766\nHere's the dimensions that it's using.\n\n1278\n01:05:33.766 --> 01:05:37.480\nHere's the color scheme and\nthe current location,\n\n1279\n01:05:37.480 --> 01:05:40.805\nthe geometry,\nall sorts of details about the window.\n\n1280\n01:05:40.805 --> 01:05:45.670\nX-Windows is drawing this on the screen,\nso it has to track this information.\n\n1281\n01:05:46.850 --> 01:05:50.150\nWe can use that programmatically,\nyou'll see a lot of software does that,\n\n1282\n01:05:50.150 --> 01:05:51.790\nif it's managing your windows.\n\n1283\n01:05:51.790 --> 01:05:54.140\nIf it's a screen reader or whatever,\n\n1284\n01:05:54.140 --> 01:05:57.410\nit has to be able to know when you've\nmoved from one window to another, so\n\n1285\n01:05:57.410 --> 01:06:00.160\nthis information is all being\ntracked in the background.\n\n1286\n01:06:00.160 --> 01:06:01.890\nIt's transparent to us, right?\n\n1287\n01:06:01.890 --> 01:06:04.860\nYour average end user has no\nidea the stuff is going on, but\n\n1288\n01:06:04.860 --> 01:06:07.170\nit's happening every second of the day.\n\n1289\n01:06:07.170 --> 01:06:10.009\nThe Windows manager has to see that stuff,\nall right?\n\n1290\n01:06:10.009 --> 01:06:14.941\nThere's other utilities like that, like\nxdpyinfo, which is another one that will\n\n1291\n01:06:14.941 --> 01:06:18.562\nshow you information about how\nyour monitor's configured.\n\n1292\n01:06:18.562 --> 01:06:21.382\nSo you'll see your color\ndepth that you support and\n\n1293\n01:06:21.382 --> 01:06:25.318\nall sorts of different information there,\nit's really a ton of data,\n\n1294\n01:06:25.318 --> 01:06:27.626\ntrying to get to the top\nof it right there.\n\n1295\n01:06:27.626 --> 01:06:31.652\nAs it starts to lay out\ninformation about your resolution,\n\n1296\n01:06:31.652 --> 01:06:34.954\nsee I'm running at 1280x720 right now,\n\n1297\n01:06:34.954 --> 01:06:39.313\nI can see that I'm at a 96 dpi,\ndots per inch, or 96 by 96.\n\n1298\n01:06:39.313 --> 01:06:41.449\nYou just see all sorts of information.\n\n1299\n01:06:41.449 --> 01:06:45.401\nAgain, more stuff that has to be tracked,\ncuz we're not just throwing text\n\n1300\n01:06:45.401 --> 01:06:48.259\non a screen anymore,\nnow we're rendering graphics.\n\n1301\n01:06:48.259 --> 01:06:51.314\nAnd so it's gotta have a good\nunderstanding of your system to do that.\n\n1302\n01:06:51.314 --> 01:06:54.600\nSo, xdpyinfo shows us that.\n\n1303\n01:06:54.600 --> 01:06:56.412\n>> Nice.\n\n1304\n01:06:56.412 --> 01:07:00.510\n>> Yeah, just a couple little things\nthat are there in the background.\n\n1305\n01:07:00.510 --> 01:07:04.822\nAll right,\nI feel like I'm leaving something out, but\n\n1306\n01:07:04.822 --> 01:07:08.050\nlooking at my notes, I don't think I am.\n\n1307\n01:07:08.050 --> 01:07:09.362\nNow, I do wanna cover one thing.\n\n1308\n01:07:09.362 --> 01:07:12.398\nI'm gonna go a little bit off the beaten\npath from the exam objectives.\n\n1309\n01:07:12.398 --> 01:07:17.099\nA lot of people look at X-Windows and\nthey see it just as a GUI for\n\n1310\n01:07:17.099 --> 01:07:20.138\nthe system while you're sitting at it.\n\n1311\n01:07:20.138 --> 01:07:24.564\nBut X-Windows is actually very, very\npowerful and any time you have something\n\n1312\n01:07:24.564 --> 01:07:28.550\nthat's very powerful,\nit's usually misunderstood, right?\n\n1313\n01:07:28.550 --> 01:07:31.134\nThe saying [LAUGH],\nI feel like I'm talking about a superhero,\n\n1314\n01:07:31.134 --> 01:07:35.190\nit's like Spider-Man, he's just\nmisunderstood, he's got emotions too.\n\n1315\n01:07:35.190 --> 01:07:36.485\nIt's okay for guys to cry.\n\n1316\n01:07:36.485 --> 01:07:41.490\n[LAUGH] But, you know it goes back to one\nof the things that I say, probably to\n\n1317\n01:07:41.490 --> 01:07:47.245\nmuch, which is 80% of the people\nonly use 20% of the features, right?\n\n1318\n01:07:47.245 --> 01:07:52.110\nX-Windows, sure it can draw\nthe graphical user interface for\n\n1319\n01:07:52.110 --> 01:07:54.980\na program on your screen and\nyou can use it, but\n\n1320\n01:07:54.980 --> 01:07:59.070\ndid you know that it doesn't\nhave to draw it to your screen?\n\n1321\n01:07:59.070 --> 01:08:01.790\nIt can draw it to anybody's screen.\n\n1322\n01:08:01.790 --> 01:08:03.610\nX-Windows is a server.\n\n1323\n01:08:03.610 --> 01:08:06.760\nYou're running the X-Windows\nserver on the back end.\n\n1324\n01:08:06.760 --> 01:08:10.740\nYou just happen to be running the client\nright here on the same machine.\n\n1325\n01:08:10.740 --> 01:08:13.120\nThat client is letting\nyou view the windows, but\n\n1326\n01:08:13.120 --> 01:08:15.260\nyou can run the client anywhere.\n\n1327\n01:08:15.260 --> 01:08:19.450\nYou can run the client on a completely\nseparate computer if you want, and\n\n1328\n01:08:19.450 --> 01:08:23.670\npeople can connect to it and see those\nwindows and launch applications and so on.\n\n1329\n01:08:23.670 --> 01:08:25.920\nIt's really, really cool, okay?\n\n1330\n01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:28.780\nLet me show you what I'm talking about cuz\njust describing it doesn't necessarily\n\n1331\n01:08:28.780 --> 01:08:30.060\ncommunicate it very well.\n\n1332\n01:08:30.060 --> 01:08:32.480\nSo let me show you what I mean.\n\n1333\n01:08:32.480 --> 01:08:36.710\nFirst off, X-Windows is set to only\nallow local communications by default.\n\n1334\n01:08:36.710 --> 01:08:41.420\nSo what we can do is we can open it up to\nallow connections from other machines.\n\n1335\n01:08:41.420 --> 01:08:42.820\nNow it's not gonna open it wide,\nfor the world.\n\n1336\n01:08:42.820 --> 01:08:45.641\nPeople still have to connect and\nauthenticate and all that good stuff.\n\n1337\n01:08:45.641 --> 01:08:50.390\nBut what we can do,\nlet me get it back into a terminal and\n\n1338\n01:08:50.390 --> 01:08:55.462\nI need to elevate my privileges\nhere real quick to do this.\n\n1339\n01:08:55.462 --> 01:09:00.171\nWe have a command called xhost, and xhost\nis what defines who's allowed to connect\n\n1340\n01:09:00.171 --> 01:09:04.629\nto this system and the default is that\nit is just limited to local connections.\n\n1341\n01:09:04.629 --> 01:09:08.110\nAnd what I'm gonna do is I'm\ngonna use xhost to open it up.\n\n1342\n01:09:08.110 --> 01:09:12.170\nNow, normally what you do\nis you say xhost + and\n\n1343\n01:09:12.170 --> 01:09:17.100\na user name or xhost + and a host name for\na computer and that'll say that\n\n1344\n01:09:17.100 --> 01:09:21.000\nthat computer is allowed to connect or\nthat user is allowed to connect.\n\n1345\n01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.170\nI'm gonna go ahead and say xhost+, and\n\n1346\n01:09:23.170 --> 01:09:27.740\nthat will say access control disabled,\nclients can connect from any host.\n\n1347\n01:09:27.740 --> 01:09:30.220\nI'm saying anybody can\nconnect to this machine.\n\n1348\n01:09:30.220 --> 01:09:33.150\nNow, I'm not completely throwing\nsecurity out the door here.\n\n1349\n01:09:33.150 --> 01:09:37.030\nPeople still have to authenticate\nto get to it, and on your network,\n\n1350\n01:09:37.030 --> 01:09:38.510\nif you're allowing connectivity\nwith the Internet,\n\n1351\n01:09:38.510 --> 01:09:41.960\nyou should be using a firewall to control\nwho's even allowed to touch this.\n\n1352\n01:09:41.960 --> 01:09:46.234\nWhat I normally do is use SSH to\nbuild a secure tunnel to my system,\n\n1353\n01:09:46.234 --> 01:09:49.187\nand once I've got SSH in place,\nfrom there,\n\n1354\n01:09:49.187 --> 01:09:53.414\nI can then connect to X-Windows and\nrun applications, right?\n\n1355\n01:09:53.414 --> 01:09:55.999\n>> So Don,\nup on your taskbar up at the very top,\n\n1356\n01:09:55.999 --> 01:09:58.802\nthe little computers have\nlittle red x on there.\n\n1357\n01:09:58.802 --> 01:10:02.610\nDo you have your network\nconnection turned on to this VM?\n\n1358\n01:10:02.610 --> 01:10:06.255\n>> It doesn't seem to say that, but\nlet's just double check, I thought I did.\n\n1359\n01:10:06.255 --> 01:10:12.050\nYeah, so\nit's probably just picking up a different\n\n1360\n01:10:12.050 --> 01:10:17.700\nadapter, maybe a loopback or something.\n\n1361\n01:10:17.700 --> 01:10:20.940\nWe can go in here and hunt that down, but\n\n1362\n01:10:20.940 --> 01:10:26.240\nif I go into my network connections, you\nknow what it is, I did a basic install.\n\n1363\n01:10:26.240 --> 01:10:30.150\nAnd in the basic install, I didn't have\nthe GUI then and so on the network\n\n1364\n01:10:30.150 --> 01:10:34.470\nadapter, I set it so that it wouldn't be\nmanaged by the network manager, right?\n\n1365\n01:10:34.470 --> 01:10:38.310\nThat was an option in the card,\nI said I'm gonna manage it myself.\n\n1366\n01:10:38.310 --> 01:10:42.330\nAnd so I did that, and so now X-Windows,\nnow that I have the network manager,\n\n1367\n01:10:42.330 --> 01:10:45.580\nit can't see the card and so\nthat's why that's coming up.\n\n1368\n01:10:45.580 --> 01:10:50.994\nThat was in, let's see if I can find it.\n\n1369\n01:10:50.994 --> 01:10:54.558\nLet's see, now I gotta remember\nwhere that setting was.\n\n1370\n01:10:54.558 --> 01:11:03.056\nIt was in /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts.\n\n1371\n01:11:05.654 --> 01:11:06.514\nThere we go.\n\n1372\n01:11:06.514 --> 01:11:10.464\nSo I'm in\n/etc/sisconfig/network-scripts and\n\n1373\n01:11:10.464 --> 01:11:15.286\nyou'll see a script in there\ncalled ifc of g-eth0, that's for\n\n1374\n01:11:15.286 --> 01:11:18.283\nmy ethernet, 0, or my first adapter.\n\n1375\n01:11:18.283 --> 01:11:25.802\nAnd if I take a look at that one,\nMy typing is horrible.\n\n1376\n01:11:25.802 --> 01:11:27.200\nThere we go.\n\n1377\n01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:30.450\nSee how I said NM CONTROLLED=no.\n\n1378\n01:11:30.450 --> 01:11:33.080\nThat's network manager\ncontrolled equals no.\n\n1379\n01:11:33.080 --> 01:11:36.930\nI set that back on, I mean that was\nlike day one of our network, so\n\n1380\n01:11:36.930 --> 01:11:38.160\nit's over a week ago now.\n\n1381\n01:11:38.160 --> 01:11:41.080\nI set that because I didn't have a GUI.\n\n1382\n01:11:41.080 --> 01:11:44.060\nSo I didn't have the network manager,\nso I just said no it's not controlled.\n\n1383\n01:11:44.060 --> 01:11:47.160\nAnd as a result, now that I do have\nthe network manager, it can't see my card.\n\n1384\n01:11:47.160 --> 01:11:48.238\nThat's what's going on.\n\n1385\n01:11:48.238 --> 01:11:52.230\nIf I changed that to yes and rebooted,\nthen it would see the card and\n\n1386\n01:11:52.230 --> 01:11:53.680\nbe able to manage it and so on.\n\n1387\n01:11:53.680 --> 01:11:55.500\nSo, that's why it's shown.\n\n1388\n01:11:55.500 --> 01:11:56.592\n>> Nice.\n\n1389\n01:11:56.592 --> 01:11:58.550\n>> All right, so I am up on the network.\n\n1390\n01:11:58.550 --> 01:12:00.897\nActually while we're in here,\nI need to get my IP address.\n\n1391\n01:12:00.897 --> 01:12:04.502\nSo the IP address of this machine, I'm\njust gonna jot it down here on my note,\n\n1392\n01:12:04.502 --> 01:12:05.782\ncuz my memory is horrible.\n\n1393\n01:12:05.782 --> 01:12:11.041\nIt's 192.168.29.139.\n\n1394\n01:12:11.041 --> 01:12:14.653\nOkay, I need that because now\nI can go to another computer,\n\n1395\n01:12:14.653 --> 01:12:17.320\nanother computer on my network.\n\n1396\n01:12:17.320 --> 01:12:20.190\nI can build an ssh tunnel to this host,\nand\n\n1397\n01:12:20.190 --> 01:12:23.100\nI can start to launch X Windows\nprograms from here, all right?\n\n1398\n01:12:23.100 --> 01:12:24.830\nI guess I need a program to run.\n\n1399\n01:12:24.830 --> 01:12:28.060\nLet me install something,\nI'll install planner.\n\n1400\n01:12:28.060 --> 01:12:30.621\nThis was that project management\nprogram I fired up earlier.\n\n1401\n01:12:30.621 --> 01:12:33.800\nAll right, so\ni'm just going to install it real quick.\n\n1402\n01:12:33.800 --> 01:12:41.520\nIt's nice and small, so Planner, if you've\nnever seen it, it's this guy right here.\n\n1403\n01:12:41.520 --> 01:12:45.465\nIt's a little project manager utility, and\nit seems to be unhappy with me right now,\n\n1404\n01:12:45.465 --> 01:12:49.670\n[LAUGH] but\nyou can basically come in and set tasks.\n\n1405\n01:12:49.670 --> 01:12:50.770\nWhat is going on here?\n\n1406\n01:12:50.770 --> 01:12:55.700\nSome of your configuration settings\nfailed to contact connection server,\n\n1407\n01:12:55.700 --> 01:12:57.120\nagain, it's because the network card is.\n\n1408\n01:12:58.400 --> 01:13:01.400\n>> So, the apps can't make\na call to your network?\n\n1409\n01:13:01.400 --> 01:13:06.228\n>> Yeah, because it's enabled in the so\nI should probably fix that, but\n\n1410\n01:13:06.228 --> 01:13:08.430\n[LAUGH] anyhow, this is the program.\n\n1411\n01:13:08.430 --> 01:13:11.930\nThat's all that's important,\nthis is the program, and so we can see it.\n\n1412\n01:13:11.930 --> 01:13:14.160\nWe could add tasks and\ndo all sorts of project management stuff.\n\n1413\n01:13:14.160 --> 01:13:15.640\nIt's very exciting, right?\n\n1414\n01:13:15.640 --> 01:13:19.140\nWell, my desktop is actually a Mac, right?\n\n1415\n01:13:19.140 --> 01:13:23.390\nSo, I'm running on a Mac, and\nthe Mac doesn't have that planner program.\n\n1416\n01:13:23.390 --> 01:13:24.370\nBut maybe I love it.\n\n1417\n01:13:24.370 --> 01:13:26.420\nI really want that planner program.\n\n1418\n01:13:26.420 --> 01:13:30.210\nWhat I can do is,\nI can use X-Windows as a Client on my Mac.\n\n1419\n01:13:30.210 --> 01:13:35.510\nAnd I can have it connect to this\nmachine and run the planner program.\n\n1420\n01:13:35.510 --> 01:13:38.540\nBut, instead of displaying\nit here on this computer.\n\n1421\n01:13:38.540 --> 01:13:40.620\nI can have it display on my Mac.\n\n1422\n01:13:40.620 --> 01:13:42.430\nAnd it'll look like it's\nrunning natively on my Mac.\n\n1423\n01:13:42.430 --> 01:13:43.810\nIt looks like it's right there.\n\n1424\n01:13:43.810 --> 01:13:46.730\nBut, in reality it's running\nback here in X Windows server.\n\n1425\n01:13:46.730 --> 01:13:51.590\nThe only difference is the display\nis being play shifted somewhere else\n\n1426\n01:13:51.590 --> 01:13:53.640\nThat's the power of x windows.\n\n1427\n01:13:53.640 --> 01:13:55.820\nX windows will run your\ngraphical applications and\n\n1428\n01:13:55.820 --> 01:13:58.630\nit will display them where ever you want.\n\n1429\n01:13:58.630 --> 01:14:00.060\nYou can have 18 monitors and\n\n1430\n01:14:00.060 --> 01:14:03.660\nyou can display it all across those\ndifferent monitors or 18 completely\n\n1431\n01:14:03.660 --> 01:14:07.890\ndifferent computers, all displaying\napplications run from one location.\n\n1432\n01:14:07.890 --> 01:14:09.840\nIt's really, really cool.\n\n1433\n01:14:09.840 --> 01:14:10.660\nOkay.\n\n1434\n01:14:10.660 --> 01:14:14.700\nWell to do it If you have other Linux\nmachine's you just need to add X Windows\n\n1435\n01:14:14.700 --> 01:14:16.880\nthem, they need to have\nthe X Window's Client.\n\n1436\n01:14:16.880 --> 01:14:23.500\nBut if you have Windows or OSX, they\ndon't have a X Window's Client on them.\n\n1437\n01:14:23.500 --> 01:14:25.750\nSo you need to go out And get one.\n\n1438\n01:14:25.750 --> 01:14:28.620\nWell, in the Windows world\n\n1439\n01:14:28.620 --> 01:14:32.170\nyou can use cygwin/x that's one\nway that you can go about it.\n\n1440\n01:14:32.170 --> 01:14:35.460\nI'm not a big fan of this one cause\nit's a little on the quirky side.\n\n1441\n01:14:35.460 --> 01:14:38.340\nOn the Windows side I usually use x ming.\n\n1442\n01:14:38.340 --> 01:14:43.270\nX ming, it's the x ming server is\nbasically X Windows for Windows.\n\n1443\n01:14:43.270 --> 01:14:47.050\nNotice that they have a Windows 7\ndesktop in the background there, and\n\n1444\n01:14:47.050 --> 01:14:52.550\nwhat your seeing is a Windows 7\ndesktop and these are applications\n\n1445\n01:14:52.550 --> 01:14:56.070\nthat are actually being run from\nan X Windows server somewhere else.\n\n1446\n01:14:56.070 --> 01:14:58.560\nSee how they all have\nthat X icon down here.\n\n1447\n01:14:58.560 --> 01:15:01.080\nSo they look like they're\nrunning on Windows.\n\n1448\n01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:04.840\nBut they're really being executed\nfrom an X server, somewhere else.\n\n1449\n01:15:04.840 --> 01:15:07.730\nXming let's you do that and\nit's really straight forward.\n\n1450\n01:15:07.730 --> 01:15:09.810\nIt's a good software.\n\n1451\n01:15:09.810 --> 01:15:13.100\nOn the Mac side, I use XQuartz.\n\n1452\n01:15:13.100 --> 01:15:15.160\nAnd really there there is no\ncompetition on the mac side.\n\n1453\n01:15:15.160 --> 01:15:16.670\nX Quartz is awesome.\n\n1454\n01:15:16.670 --> 01:15:18.270\nIt's free and open source.\n\n1455\n01:15:18.270 --> 01:15:19.830\nYou can download it and install it.\n\n1456\n01:15:19.830 --> 01:15:22.340\nI know it says for OSX 10.6.\n\n1457\n01:15:22.340 --> 01:15:24.960\nActually it says including Mavericks.\n\n1458\n01:15:24.960 --> 01:15:27.660\nI'm running it on Mavericks just fine, and\n\n1459\n01:15:27.660 --> 01:15:31.920\nit's basically an X Windows client for\nOSX.\n\n1460\n01:15:31.920 --> 01:15:33.930\nIt works really well.\n\n1461\n01:15:33.930 --> 01:15:35.950\nI've got it installed or\nat least I think I do.\n\n1462\n01:15:37.250 --> 01:15:41.260\nYep, there it is, so\nI'm just gonna fire up X Quartz, and\n\n1463\n01:15:41.260 --> 01:15:46.300\nwhen you fire it up,\nyou get a bash prompt.\n\n1464\n01:15:46.300 --> 01:15:50.190\nNow, the bash prompt is actually for\nright here on my Mac, and so\n\n1465\n01:15:50.190 --> 01:15:55.460\nI need to build a connection to that\nvirtual machine where I'm running Linux,\n\n1466\n01:15:55.460 --> 01:15:58.636\nand so I'm gonna run ssh and\nI'm gonna use -y.\n\n1467\n01:15:58.636 --> 01:16:04.170\nThere's -x and -y, both of which\nare indicating that I'm gonna build remote\n\n1468\n01:16:04.170 --> 01:16:08.840\nwindow sessions to the other side, and\nso I'll just tell it that I'm going to\n\n1469\n01:16:08.840 --> 01:16:13.270\nremote over that other side and\nconnect up and try and do some damage.\n\n1470\n01:16:13.270 --> 01:16:19.570\nI'm gonna log in as dpezet on\nthe other side, and what was that IP?\n\n1471\n01:16:19.570 --> 01:16:24.230\nIt was 192.168.29.139,\nremembering the IP is\n\n1472\n01:16:24.230 --> 01:16:28.765\nreally the hardest part of this\nwhole process, so I'm gonna connect.\n\n1473\n01:16:28.765 --> 01:16:31.475\nIt's the first time I'm connecting,\nso I have to say whether or\n\n1474\n01:16:31.475 --> 01:16:35.535\nnot I trust that certificate,\nso I'll say yes, and so\n\n1475\n01:16:35.535 --> 01:16:39.775\nit's gonna add it, and\nnow, it wants my password.\n\n1476\n01:16:39.775 --> 01:16:44.620\n>> So, maybe, if I had missed the show,\nbut, so, on CentOS, I mean,\n\n1477\n01:16:44.620 --> 01:16:48.240\nis there already an SH server or whatnot\nserver running, like, built into it, so\n\n1478\n01:16:48.240 --> 01:16:49.560\nyou don't have to install anything else?\n\n1479\n01:16:49.560 --> 01:16:50.820\n>> Didn't even have to install anything.\n\n1480\n01:16:50.820 --> 01:16:54.900\nYeah, in fact, every modern Linux distro\nhas that, SSH is turned on by default,\n\n1481\n01:16:54.900 --> 01:16:59.690\nIf it isn't, you may need to start\nthe sshd service or the open\n\n1482\n01:16:59.690 --> 01:17:04.080\nssh service depending on what disk trial,\nbut it's usually on by default.\n\n1483\n01:17:04.080 --> 01:17:07.640\nNow I didn't log in as root,\nand on most distros,\n\n1484\n01:17:07.640 --> 01:17:11.360\nroot is not allowed in the ssh cuz,\nagain, if you're a hacker,\n\n1485\n01:17:11.360 --> 01:17:14.430\nif you're trying to break in\n>> What account you're gonna go for?\n\n1486\n01:17:14.430 --> 01:17:17.430\nRoot, so it's normally blocked off,\nbut I'm using my regular user,\n\n1487\n01:17:17.430 --> 01:17:20.670\njust D Pizet, and\nI know that's really small.\n\n1488\n01:17:20.670 --> 01:17:26.288\nMy font is not the biggest,\nthat made no difference whatsoever.\n\n1489\n01:17:26.288 --> 01:17:29.030\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah, so anyhow,\n\n1490\n01:17:29.030 --> 01:17:31.630\nbut\n>> Could probably bump my font up somehow,\n\n1491\n01:17:31.630 --> 01:17:33.227\nbut-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1492\n01:17:33.227 --> 01:17:34.550\n>> Not, not like that.\n\n1493\n01:17:34.550 --> 01:17:37.930\nYeah, but apparently,\nI'm just beyond actually.\n\n1494\n01:17:37.930 --> 01:17:39.204\nYou know what, forget it.\n\n1495\n01:17:39.204 --> 01:17:41.240\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, I just did ssh-y and\n\n1496\n01:17:41.240 --> 01:17:45.490\nthen I did my name @ and the IP address\nof the host I was connecting to.\n\n1497\n01:17:45.490 --> 01:17:46.920\nI provided my password.\n\n1498\n01:17:46.920 --> 01:17:53.060\n>> And now I've got an SSH tunnel that's\nready to launch remote applications.\n\n1499\n01:17:53.060 --> 01:17:55.930\nSo now remember on the other\nside were I run planner and\n\n1500\n01:17:55.930 --> 01:17:58.450\na pound symbol,\nwe'll I'm gonna do the same thing here.\n\n1501\n01:17:58.450 --> 01:18:00.760\nI'm gonna run planner and\nthe pound symbol and\n\n1502\n01:18:00.760 --> 01:18:04.330\nwhat's it gonna do is it's gonna\nlaunch that and if you look,\n\n1503\n01:18:04.330 --> 01:18:07.910\nlet me, you know I got to may windows\nopen, let me minimize some of these junk.\n\n1504\n01:18:07.910 --> 01:18:12.330\nYou'll see that I'm on my Mach\n>> Here's my Mac desktop back here,\n\n1505\n01:18:13.740 --> 01:18:16.300\nand, really you're not gonna let me?\n\n1506\n01:18:16.300 --> 01:18:18.062\nThere.\n[LAUGH] Please let me drag and drop.\n\n1507\n01:18:18.062 --> 01:18:21.400\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So you'll see my Mac desktop back here.\n\n1508\n01:18:21.400 --> 01:18:23.000\nHere's my little launcher.\n\n1509\n01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.050\nI got my Macintosh hard drive and\nall that.\n\n1510\n01:18:25.050 --> 01:18:27.130\nAnd then I launch Planner, and\n\n1511\n01:18:27.130 --> 01:18:30.000\nit looks like Planner is running\nright here on my Mac, right?\n\n1512\n01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.059\nI mean it looks like\nthis is just straight up\n\n1513\n01:18:33.220 --> 01:18:35.760\n>> Me doing work whatever.\n\n1514\n01:18:35.760 --> 01:18:38.390\nAnd I can get in here and\nI can start to work with this.\n\n1515\n01:18:38.390 --> 01:18:42.240\nAnd insert my tasks in fact I'm\nnot even getting that error.\n\n1516\n01:18:42.240 --> 01:18:43.510\nSo I'm going to put in,\n\n1517\n01:18:43.510 --> 01:18:46.690\nI'm starting a project here to fire\n>> No.\n\n1518\n01:18:46.690 --> 01:18:48.630\n>> So step one.\n\n1519\n01:18:48.630 --> 01:18:49.860\nWrite pink slip.\n\n1520\n01:18:52.130 --> 01:18:55.734\nAnd\n>> [CROSSTALK] Did I spell it wrong?\n\n1521\n01:18:55.734 --> 01:18:57.110\nI did.\nI spelled it wrong.\n\n1522\n01:18:57.110 --> 01:18:57.610\n>> Zing.\n\n1523\n01:18:58.910 --> 01:18:59.520\nGood one, yeah.\n\n1524\n01:18:59.520 --> 01:19:00.575\nWho should be terminated now?\n\n1525\n01:19:00.575 --> 01:19:04.100\n>> [LAUGH] So I can go through and\nstart to do this.\n\n1526\n01:19:04.100 --> 01:19:07.520\nJust write it up and do all\nthe different things that I need to do.\n\n1527\n01:19:07.520 --> 01:19:08.440\nLink these together.\n\n1528\n01:19:08.440 --> 01:19:09.620\nI'm working with project management.\n\n1529\n01:19:09.620 --> 01:19:13.250\nNow, I can run my favorite Linux apps,\nthe programs I wanna run.\n\n1530\n01:19:13.250 --> 01:19:14.460\nI can run them on my Mac.\n\n1531\n01:19:14.460 --> 01:19:17.210\nAnd I didn't have to do any\ncrazy virtualization sublayer or\n\n1532\n01:19:17.210 --> 01:19:18.310\nanything like that.\n\n1533\n01:19:18.310 --> 01:19:19.960\nI just needed an X windows client.\n\n1534\n01:19:19.960 --> 01:19:24.150\nThis program is actually running on my\nLinux box, it's not running on the mac.\n\n1535\n01:19:24.150 --> 01:19:24.690\nRight?\n\n1536\n01:19:24.690 --> 01:19:26.100\nBut I see it here.\n\n1537\n01:19:26.100 --> 01:19:29.490\nAnd it's the same thing when\nyou run x ming on windows\n\n1538\n01:19:29.490 --> 01:19:33.250\nit looks like the application's running\nright there on windows, but it's not.\n\n1539\n01:19:33.250 --> 01:19:36.810\nIt's running on the x server\nhosted on your Linux And\n\n1540\n01:19:36.810 --> 01:19:40.650\nyou could have hundreds, even\nthousands of users connected this way.\n\n1541\n01:19:40.650 --> 01:19:43.893\nWhere they're all running\napplications off if your server.\n\n1542\n01:19:43.893 --> 01:19:47.320\nYou server that might not even\nhave a GUI running on it.\n\n1543\n01:19:47.320 --> 01:19:50.550\nIt might be sitting at\na command prompt just waiting.\n\n1544\n01:19:50.550 --> 01:19:53.820\nAnd all the remote sessions Are GUI based.\n\n1545\n01:19:53.820 --> 01:19:55.220\nIt's really cool stuff.\n\n1546\n01:19:55.220 --> 01:19:59.432\n>> You know, Don, so looking at this\nstuff and I'm kind of a Windows guy but\n\n1547\n01:19:59.432 --> 01:20:04.130\nyou know, with your little command prompt\nthere entering it in, it looks like,\n\n1548\n01:20:04.130 --> 01:20:07.239\na lot like you're entering\nin a power cell session and\n\n1549\n01:20:07.239 --> 01:20:10.376\nthen running the stuff here\nin like at v at Microsoft.\n\n1550\n01:20:10.376 --> 01:20:11.317\n>> Of course.\n\n1551\n01:20:11.317 --> 01:20:15.270\nSetting that stuff up is a bit more\ninvolved, and you just fired it up,\n\n1552\n01:20:15.270 --> 01:20:18.151\nyou clicked a couple things,\nyou typed a line, and\n\n1553\n01:20:18.151 --> 01:20:21.210\nnow you're running a remote application.\n\n1554\n01:20:21.210 --> 01:20:23.714\nAnd much, much easier then App-V.\n\n1555\n01:20:23.714 --> 01:20:27.470\n>> The big difference, aside from it being\neasier, right, cuz App-V is a nightmare.\n\n1556\n01:20:27.470 --> 01:20:30.090\nIf you never heard of App-V\nit's Microsoft's application\n\n1557\n01:20:30.090 --> 01:20:32.510\nvirtualization stuff,\nand it's a nightmare.\n\n1558\n01:20:32.510 --> 01:20:36.080\nThe big difference is Linux has\nbeen doing this for over 20 years.\n\n1559\n01:20:36.080 --> 01:20:36.890\n>> Right.\n>> Right, but\n\n1560\n01:20:36.890 --> 01:20:40.920\nWindows, Microsoft has been rolling those\nfeatures out over the last seven years.\n\n1561\n01:20:40.920 --> 01:20:43.070\nThey've really just\nbeen getting into that.\n\n1562\n01:20:43.070 --> 01:20:48.250\nTheir terminal server just in general\ndidn't really kick off until like 1999.\n\n1563\n01:20:48.250 --> 01:20:51.310\nX Windows has had this since day one,\nand it's 30 years old.\n\n1564\n01:20:51.310 --> 01:20:54.440\nSo it's been around a long time.\n\n1565\n01:20:54.440 --> 01:20:57.680\nAnd other vendors like Microsoft and\n\n1566\n01:20:57.680 --> 01:21:01.180\neven Apple recognize that\nthere's value in that.\n\n1567\n01:21:01.180 --> 01:21:04.140\nThere's value in being able\nto run applications remotely,\n\n1568\n01:21:04.140 --> 01:21:07.880\nnot having to install and\nmanage the application on my client.\n\n1569\n01:21:07.880 --> 01:21:09.690\nInstead, just remotely connect to it.\n\n1570\n01:21:09.690 --> 01:21:10.920\nIt's already installed on the other side.\n\n1571\n01:21:10.920 --> 01:21:12.700\nIt's got all the packages it needs.\n\n1572\n01:21:12.700 --> 01:21:16.350\nIf I wanna do an upgrade, so\nI decide it's time to upgrade planner.\n\n1573\n01:21:16.350 --> 01:21:18.190\nWell, if I have it\ninstalled on 50 machines,\n\n1574\n01:21:18.190 --> 01:21:20.900\nI've gotta go and upgrade it in 50 places.\n\n1575\n01:21:20.900 --> 01:21:25.120\nBut if I'm running it remotely like this,\neverybody's running it off of one server,\n\n1576\n01:21:25.120 --> 01:21:29.250\nI just upgrade that one server and\nnow everybody's updated.\n\n1577\n01:21:29.250 --> 01:21:32.090\nOf course, if that one server fails,\nwhat happens to everybody?\n\n1578\n01:21:32.090 --> 01:21:33.070\nEverybody fails, right?\n\n1579\n01:21:33.070 --> 01:21:34.740\nSo, it gives you a central\npoint of failure.\n\n1580\n01:21:34.740 --> 01:21:39.360\nPros and cons of each model, there's no\nright answer because every environment is\n\n1581\n01:21:39.360 --> 01:21:41.980\na little bit different,\neverybody has slightly different needs but\n\n1582\n01:21:41.980 --> 01:21:44.720\nthis is the true power of X Windows,\nright?\n\n1583\n01:21:44.720 --> 01:21:47.840\nThe fact that it can render\nyour windows anywhere,\n\n1584\n01:21:47.840 --> 01:21:50.200\nnot just on the machine\nthat you're sitting at.\n\n1585\n01:21:50.200 --> 01:21:53.320\nIt can do it anywhere,\nand it's pretty cool.\n\n1586\n01:21:53.320 --> 01:21:56.260\n>> So you could be running\na bunch of these applications,\n\n1587\n01:21:56.260 --> 01:22:01.450\nand it will be using the RAM and\nthe hard disk on that server then,\n\n1588\n01:22:01.450 --> 01:22:03.660\nand so it won't be taxing\nyour little system here.\n\n1589\n01:22:03.660 --> 01:22:04.340\n>> Yeah.\nI mean, here\n\n1590\n01:22:04.340 --> 01:22:05.750\nI've got the X Windows client.\n\n1591\n01:22:05.750 --> 01:22:06.290\nAnd that's it.\n\n1592\n01:22:06.290 --> 01:22:08.930\nSo, the ex Windows client has probably\ntaken a couple of megs of RAM\n\n1593\n01:22:08.930 --> 01:22:09.860\nand that's it.\n\n1594\n01:22:09.860 --> 01:22:14.600\nMeanwhile, planner is actually running\nback over here on my Linux box.\n\n1595\n01:22:14.600 --> 01:22:17.800\nSo, it's running here and\nit's consuming memory and\n\n1596\n01:22:17.800 --> 01:22:22.885\nso on here, now on this one, I see planner\nhere just cuz I ran it earlier, but\n\n1597\n01:22:22.885 --> 01:22:25.705\nI don't see a planner window open.\n\n1598\n01:22:25.705 --> 01:22:31.050\nBut if I do a PS aux,\nand I pass that through.\n\n1599\n01:22:31.050 --> 01:22:32.630\nAnd I look for planner.\n\n1600\n01:22:33.720 --> 01:22:35.070\nI'll find it in there.\n\n1601\n01:22:35.070 --> 01:22:39.270\nWell I see my graip also but\nthere it is deposit is running planner.\n\n1602\n01:22:39.270 --> 01:22:40.770\nThe GUI application.\n\n1603\n01:22:40.770 --> 01:22:44.380\nIt's just not coming up on my screen,\nit's coming up remotely.\n\n1604\n01:22:44.380 --> 01:22:47.000\nIt's being sent onto a remote screen.\n\n1605\n01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:48.350\nReally neat.\n\n1606\n01:22:48.350 --> 01:22:51.300\n>> Mm-hm. That is. That is pretty slick,\nand pretty, yeah, pretty straight forward,\n\n1607\n01:22:51.300 --> 01:22:52.040\npretty seamless.\n\n1608\n01:22:52.040 --> 01:22:54.092\n>> It helps when it's built into the OS.\n\n1609\n01:22:54.092 --> 01:22:56.630\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, there is one last thing that\n\n1610\n01:22:56.630 --> 01:22:58.690\nwe wanna talk about with\nthe graphical user interface and\n\n1611\n01:22:58.690 --> 01:23:02.770\nthat is accessibility options and\nfeatures.\n\n1612\n01:23:02.770 --> 01:23:04.270\nSo we're gonna take a look at that, but\n\n1613\n01:23:04.270 --> 01:23:07.230\nI see I've already run overtime on\nthis segment, so why don't we do this.\n\n1614\n01:23:07.230 --> 01:23:10.710\nLet's stop and take a break, and when\nwe get back we're gonna take a look at\n\n1615\n01:23:10.710 --> 01:23:15.170\nthe accessibility tools and how we can\nuse those to better interact with our OS.\n\n1616\n01:23:15.170 --> 01:23:20.348\nStay tuned, we'll be back in a few.\n\n1617\n01:23:20.348 --> 01:23:24.730\n[SOUND] All right.\n\n1618\n01:23:24.730 --> 01:23:26.290\nWelcome back, everybody.\n\n1619\n01:23:26.290 --> 01:23:29.840\nSo, for the last part of this show,\nI wanna talk a little bit about\n\n1620\n01:23:29.840 --> 01:23:34.820\naccessibility options or\nassistive technologies.\n\n1621\n01:23:34.820 --> 01:23:36.990\nA number of different names for it.\n\n1622\n01:23:36.990 --> 01:23:40.690\nGraphical user interfaces, and\nreally computers in general.\n\n1623\n01:23:40.690 --> 01:23:45.030\nThey're designed for people that have\na full range of sight and auditory and\n\n1624\n01:23:45.030 --> 01:23:49.130\nphysical control and not everyone\nis fortunate enough to have that.\n\n1625\n01:23:49.130 --> 01:23:52.980\nMany people have needs that kinda\ndiffer from the standard use scenario\n\n1626\n01:23:52.980 --> 01:23:53.720\nof a system.\n\n1627\n01:23:53.720 --> 01:23:58.840\nSo for example if you're visually\nimpaired, that nice pretty splash screen,\n\n1628\n01:23:58.840 --> 01:23:59.870\nthe graphics on the screen,\n\n1629\n01:23:59.870 --> 01:24:03.130\nthey don't really help you to be\nable to interact with the computer.\n\n1630\n01:24:03.130 --> 01:24:06.310\nAnd so most operating systems, Linux and\n\n1631\n01:24:06.310 --> 01:24:10.660\nLinux Distros is no exception have various\nsoftware packages and functions that can\n\n1632\n01:24:10.660 --> 01:24:15.320\nhelp to remove those barriers to basically\nmake computers accessible to everyone.\n\n1633\n01:24:15.320 --> 01:24:18.640\nNot just people that fit\nthe common use scenario.\n\n1634\n01:24:18.640 --> 01:24:22.320\nNow, some of these are for\nvery specific scenarios.\n\n1635\n01:24:22.320 --> 01:24:26.650\nFor example, if you are blind you\nare not gonna be able to receive that\n\n1636\n01:24:26.650 --> 01:24:31.220\nvisual input from the PC, so you need some\nother way to to get that information.\n\n1637\n01:24:31.220 --> 01:24:34.400\nBut some of these are really\njust a matter of convenience.\n\n1638\n01:24:34.400 --> 01:24:38.530\nMaybe you have small hands and\nit's very difficult for\n\n1639\n01:24:38.530 --> 01:24:41.920\nyou to hold down the Shift key\nwhile you press another key, and\n\n1640\n01:24:41.920 --> 01:24:45.100\nso we can use this assistive\ntechnologies to help with that too.\n\n1641\n01:24:45.100 --> 01:24:49.320\nSo don't immediately think in your mind\nthat there's just certain people that\n\n1642\n01:24:49.320 --> 01:24:50.660\nthese meet the needs for.\n\n1643\n01:24:50.660 --> 01:24:54.870\nMany of us can use the assistive\ntechnologies, sadly I find myself starting\n\n1644\n01:24:54.870 --> 01:24:58.080\nto use the screen magnifier as\nthe resolution on these machines keeps\n\n1645\n01:24:58.080 --> 01:25:01.000\ngetting higher and higher and\nmy eyes don't get better and better.\n\n1646\n01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:05.365\nSo, these definitely fit all\nsorts of different scenarios.\n\n1647\n01:25:05.365 --> 01:25:07.925\nSo I wanna walk you through some\nof the ones that are available.\n\n1648\n01:25:07.925 --> 01:25:11.475\nI am gonna focus on Gnome,\nbecause Gnome is the most common desktop.\n\n1649\n01:25:11.475 --> 01:25:14.756\nThe assistive technologies do\nvery from desktop to desktop.\n\n1650\n01:25:14.756 --> 01:25:17.173\nIt really is your window\nmanager that determines it.\n\n1651\n01:25:17.173 --> 01:25:22.289\nSo it doesn't matter if I'm running or\nor Red Hat or Slackware or\n\n1652\n01:25:22.289 --> 01:25:27.255\nwhatever, if I'm running Gnome I'm gonna\nhave the same set of accessibility\n\n1653\n01:25:27.255 --> 01:25:32.172\nfeatures to be able to use my system,\nor the assist of technologies, right.\n\n1654\n01:25:32.172 --> 01:25:36.801\nSo on the Gnome website, help.gnome.org\nthey actually have their assistive\n\n1655\n01:25:36.801 --> 01:25:41.568\ntechnologies desktop guide, and it walks\nthrough some of the different features\n\n1656\n01:25:41.568 --> 01:25:46.150\nthat are available, and the different\nscenarios where they're useful for.\n\n1657\n01:25:46.150 --> 01:25:51.380\nSo, if you have full legal blindness,\nif you just have a visual impairment,\n\n1658\n01:25:51.380 --> 01:25:55.920\nyou're not completely blind, but\nyou're not yeah, able to see 20/20.\n\n1659\n01:25:55.920 --> 01:26:00.530\nHearing impairments, mobility impairments,\nand that's becoming, sadly,\n\n1660\n01:26:00.530 --> 01:26:02.570\na very needed thing.\n\n1661\n01:26:02.570 --> 01:26:06.470\nThere's a lot of degenerative diseases and\nthings that affect people.\n\n1662\n01:26:06.470 --> 01:26:10.760\nAnd in the past, it would prevent\nyou from using a computer outright.\n\n1663\n01:26:10.760 --> 01:26:13.810\nSo they've really come a long\nway in making that case.\n\n1664\n01:26:13.810 --> 01:26:17.430\nBecause computers, computers can\nreally enrich the lives of a lot of\n\n1665\n01:26:17.430 --> 01:26:20.250\npeople if they are able\nto make use of them.\n\n1666\n01:26:20.250 --> 01:26:23.190\nSo we see a ton of different things and\nherein,\n\n1667\n01:26:23.190 --> 01:26:26.200\nif you ever browse through\ntheir help documentation.\n\n1668\n01:26:26.200 --> 01:26:29.240\nThey explain them all outright and\nkind of what they do.\n\n1669\n01:26:29.240 --> 01:26:33.020\nBut just kind of running down the list,\nas far as visual impairments,\n\n1670\n01:26:33.020 --> 01:26:36.360\none of the most useful\nthings is a screen reader.\n\n1671\n01:26:36.360 --> 01:26:40.590\nA screen reader will take what's\non your screen and read it aloud.\n\n1672\n01:26:40.590 --> 01:26:44.950\nI made a comment when we were\ninstalling GNOME or KDE earlier,\n\n1673\n01:26:44.950 --> 01:26:47.800\nthat Orca was one of\nthe packages that was installed.\n\n1674\n01:26:47.800 --> 01:26:50.000\nWell, in the Red Hat based OSs and\n\n1675\n01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:53.210\nin many others we have Orca\nwhich is a screen reader.\n\n1676\n01:26:53.210 --> 01:26:57.270\nIt will take text that appears on\nthe screen and read it out loud to people.\n\n1677\n01:26:57.270 --> 01:27:00.080\nSo, if you can't necessarily\nsee what's going on,\n\n1678\n01:27:00.080 --> 01:27:02.830\nit's reading that text\nthrough an auditory means.\n\n1679\n01:27:02.830 --> 01:27:04.490\nSo that you can hear what's going on.\n\n1680\n01:27:04.490 --> 01:27:05.180\nAll right.\n\n1681\n01:27:05.180 --> 01:27:08.820\nThat is one very easy solution to use\nbecause it doesn't require special\n\n1682\n01:27:08.820 --> 01:27:10.470\nhardware right.\n\n1683\n01:27:10.470 --> 01:27:13.840\nBut if this is something\nyou deal with everyday\n\n1684\n01:27:13.840 --> 01:27:17.079\nthen you may choose to use\nwhat's called a monitor.\n\n1685\n01:27:17.079 --> 01:27:22.070\nA monitor is instead of displayed a visual\noutput, that's not gonna help you.\n\n1686\n01:27:22.070 --> 01:27:26.120\nIt will basically display a braille\noutput that you can use your sense of\n\n1687\n01:27:26.120 --> 01:27:28.470\ntouch to be able to\ninterpret the feedback.\n\n1688\n01:27:28.470 --> 01:27:32.230\nAnd has support for\nthat and it's again through.\n\n1689\n01:27:32.230 --> 01:27:35.355\nSays, hey instead of reading\nit out loud through audio\n\n1690\n01:27:35.355 --> 01:27:37.795\nwe can represent it through\na braille keyboard.\n\n1691\n01:27:37.795 --> 01:27:40.125\nAnd I was mentioning this earlier and\n\n1692\n01:27:40.125 --> 01:27:42.625\nit turns out most of the guys on\nthe set had not seen one of these.\n\n1693\n01:27:42.625 --> 01:27:47.490\nI had seen one in the past for\nvarious reasons.\n\n1694\n01:27:47.490 --> 01:27:50.750\nBut this is an example here\nof a braille keyboard.\n\n1695\n01:27:50.750 --> 01:27:52.796\nI shouldn't call it a keyboard.\n\n1696\n01:27:52.796 --> 01:27:54.780\nIt's a monitor.\nI mean it is effectively a monitor.\n\n1697\n01:27:54.780 --> 01:27:57.410\nIt's just not a visual monitor in\nthe way that we think about it.\n\n1698\n01:27:57.410 --> 01:28:00.964\nAnd what it does is it has little\ntactile bumps that change,\n\n1699\n01:28:00.964 --> 01:28:04.533\nbased on what's being displayed\non the screen, so it's.\n\n1700\n01:28:04.533 --> 01:28:08.780\nAlmost more like a printer, except it's\ndynamic, it's constantly changing,\n\n1701\n01:28:08.780 --> 01:28:13.440\nthe bumps come up and go down as needed,\nand they make portable versions and so on.\n\n1702\n01:28:13.440 --> 01:28:17.600\nAnd so, if we enable Orca, and\nwe tell it we have a Braille monitor,\n\n1703\n01:28:17.600 --> 01:28:20.611\nit can output to that, and now when\ntext is represented on the screen,\n\n1704\n01:28:20.611 --> 01:28:25.790\nwe can feel the text and be able to\nread it that way, or even do both.\n\n1705\n01:28:25.790 --> 01:28:29.040\nYou can have it read it out loud and\ngive you the braille interpretation,\n\n1706\n01:28:29.040 --> 01:28:30.250\nit can output to both.\n\n1707\n01:28:30.250 --> 01:28:35.074\nVery, very useful, and that's built in,\nif we choose to turn it on, all right?\n\n1708\n01:28:35.074 --> 01:28:37.407\nAll of these options are like that,\nthey're built in.\n\n1709\n01:28:37.407 --> 01:28:40.990\nWe just have to turn them on, and they try\nto make that as easy as possible because\n\n1710\n01:28:40.990 --> 01:28:44.570\nthe first time you sit down at a computer,\nif it's not equipped for this stuff,\n\n1711\n01:28:44.570 --> 01:28:47.395\nthen you're gonna have a hard\ntime getting that up and going.\n\n1712\n01:28:47.395 --> 01:28:52.540\n>> Mm-hm, all right, so Don, so we've got\na screen reader that will read back, we've\n\n1713\n01:28:52.540 --> 01:28:58.730\ngot this braille monitor that will kind of\nprint it out, what about the input stuff?\n\n1714\n01:28:58.730 --> 01:29:01.860\nSo, how are you going to get\nthe information into it?\n\n1715\n01:29:01.860 --> 01:29:04.520\nSo, we get information out\nof it by putting it into it,\n\n1716\n01:29:04.520 --> 01:29:09.600\nwas there more In there as far\nas dictation or something?\n\n1717\n01:29:09.600 --> 01:29:14.510\n>> Now that one's a little easier\nbecause all input these days is being\n\n1718\n01:29:14.510 --> 01:29:19.690\nmanaged by the HID system, the human\ninput device, or human interface devices,\n\n1719\n01:29:19.690 --> 01:29:24.550\nand so keyboards and mice that hook up\nvia USB, they're recognized as HID.\n\n1720\n01:29:24.550 --> 01:29:27.550\nAnd so, you'll see a lot of inputs like,\n\n1721\n01:29:28.960 --> 01:29:33.970\nif you are a quadriplegic, then you're\nnot able to use a traditional mouse, but\n\n1722\n01:29:33.970 --> 01:29:36.900\na lot of times they can rig you up with\na joystick that you can operate with your\n\n1723\n01:29:36.900 --> 01:29:40.705\nchin, if you have that mobility,\nor with your mouth, if you don't.\n\n1724\n01:29:40.705 --> 01:29:43.125\nSome of them even have where you can\nmanipulate with your eyes, right,\n\n1725\n01:29:43.125 --> 01:29:44.635\nit tracks eye movement.\n\n1726\n01:29:44.635 --> 01:29:48.775\nIn the end of the day, you'll have\nan application, usually specialized for\n\n1727\n01:29:48.775 --> 01:29:53.235\nthe hardware that you're using that\ntranslates whatever that input is into\n\n1728\n01:29:53.235 --> 01:29:55.385\nmouth movements or\ncursor movements, or whatever, and\n\n1729\n01:29:55.385 --> 01:29:58.565\nit's done entirely through the HID system,\nso that's easier.\n\n1730\n01:29:58.565 --> 01:30:00.685\nI don't want to say it's too easy cuz,\nI mean,\n\n1731\n01:30:00.685 --> 01:30:03.918\nit does take a pretty good amount of\nwork to make these things happen, but\n\n1732\n01:30:03.918 --> 01:30:06.742\nit's simpler just because\nthe computer receives that input.\n\n1733\n01:30:06.742 --> 01:30:10.778\nThe output is more challenging\ncuz you're taking content that\n\n1734\n01:30:10.778 --> 01:30:14.740\nwasn't necessarily rendered\nwith accessibility in mind and\n\n1735\n01:30:14.740 --> 01:30:18.866\nhaving to convert it to give it out so\nthat is a little bit harder.\n\n1736\n01:30:18.866 --> 01:30:22.946\nSome of the other accessibility features\nare things that would pertain to people\n\n1737\n01:30:22.946 --> 01:30:24.732\nwith other ailments.\n\n1738\n01:30:24.732 --> 01:30:30.160\nFor example, let's say you're\na Parkinson's patient, right?\n\n1739\n01:30:30.160 --> 01:30:32.140\nParkinson's Disease,\nif you're not familiar with it,\n\n1740\n01:30:32.140 --> 01:30:36.270\nis a muscular degenerative disease, and\nit causes you to lose muscle control,\n\n1741\n01:30:36.270 --> 01:30:38.905\nso it becomes very hard\nto do precise movements.\n\n1742\n01:30:38.905 --> 01:30:44.260\nDouble-tapping of keys is very common, so\ntyping becomes a real challenge, right?\n\n1743\n01:30:44.260 --> 01:30:46.350\nIt can be really frustrating, and so\n\n1744\n01:30:46.350 --> 01:30:51.520\nwe have the option to turn on,\nwe'll see it back here.\n\n1745\n01:30:51.520 --> 01:30:56.140\nTo turn on, let's see what is it\ncalled it's in here somewhere.\n\n1746\n01:30:56.140 --> 01:30:59.590\nLet's see bounce keys, there we go.\n\n1747\n01:30:59.590 --> 01:31:03.010\nBounce keys and slow keys,\nboth of which can help with that.\n\n1748\n01:31:03.010 --> 01:31:06.360\nSo bounce keys,\nwe ignore quickly repeated key presses.\n\n1749\n01:31:06.360 --> 01:31:08.100\nSo, if it's an accidental jitter,\n\n1750\n01:31:08.100 --> 01:31:12.160\nyou tap the keys a couple of times,\nit will interpret that as one key press,\n\n1751\n01:31:12.160 --> 01:31:14.560\ninstead of multiple, so\nthat's a very nice feature.\n\n1752\n01:31:15.580 --> 01:31:18.850\nThere is the opposite where\nwe can do sticky keys.\n\n1753\n01:31:18.850 --> 01:31:21.800\nI mentioned, maybe you just have\nsmall hands, and it's difficult for\n\n1754\n01:31:21.800 --> 01:31:25.715\nyou to operate that Shift key and\nthe letter, or whatever.\n\n1755\n01:31:25.715 --> 01:31:30.595\nSticky keys is where you can, if I want\nto write a capital F, normally I would\n\n1756\n01:31:30.595 --> 01:31:34.945\nhold Shift, and I would hit F, and\nthen that would create the capital F, but\n\n1757\n01:31:34.945 --> 01:31:38.241\nif you can't operate that way,\nthen you can turn on Sticky Keys.\n\n1758\n01:31:38.241 --> 01:31:42.550\nYou can tap the Shift key and\nlet it go, and\n\n1759\n01:31:42.550 --> 01:31:46.270\nthe system will treat it as if it is still\ndown, until you press your next letter,\n\n1760\n01:31:46.270 --> 01:31:51.500\nand then when you press F\nthen you get a capital F.\n\n1761\n01:31:51.500 --> 01:31:53.980\nThat's an incredibly useful thing for\n\n1762\n01:31:53.980 --> 01:31:57.200\npeople that find it difficult\nto manipulate a keyboard.\n\n1763\n01:31:57.200 --> 01:32:02.180\nAll of these accessibility or\nassistive technologies Have purpose right.\n\n1764\n01:32:02.180 --> 01:32:06.700\nAnd it's a matter of finding which ones\nmeet the needs of either yourself or\n\n1765\n01:32:06.700 --> 01:32:09.800\nthe person you're trying to assist\nto be able to use a computer.\n\n1766\n01:32:09.800 --> 01:32:12.230\nDon't pigeon hole yourself to\none technology or another right.\n\n1767\n01:32:12.230 --> 01:32:14.320\nYou'll need to find a mixture of them.\n\n1768\n01:32:14.320 --> 01:32:17.210\nAnd you don't have to settle for\nwhat's built in the system either.\n\n1769\n01:32:17.210 --> 01:32:20.340\nSo, for example, Orca,\nit's a good screen reader.\n\n1770\n01:32:20.340 --> 01:32:22.050\nYou can use it, it works well.\n\n1771\n01:32:22.050 --> 01:32:23.530\nBut maybe you just don't like it.\n\n1772\n01:32:23.530 --> 01:32:26.777\nThere are other ones that are out there.\n\n1773\n01:32:26.777 --> 01:32:29.003\nSpecifically calls out Emacspeak.\n\n1774\n01:32:29.003 --> 01:32:31.430\nAnd I've never used Use\nthis one personally, but\n\n1775\n01:32:31.430 --> 01:32:35.340\nit's another one that's out there\nthat is a third party screen reader.\n\n1776\n01:32:35.340 --> 01:32:39.900\nSo, you can load that and they've got\nseveral different versions of it and\n\n1777\n01:32:39.900 --> 01:32:43.460\nyou can run it and it's basically\na screen reader much like Orca.\n\n1778\n01:32:43.460 --> 01:32:46.490\nSome people prefer one or\nthe other because of language support.\n\n1779\n01:32:46.490 --> 01:32:50.660\nI don't know native you listen\nto the text-to-speech voices.\n\n1780\n01:32:50.660 --> 01:32:52.300\nSometimes their painful.\n\n1781\n01:32:52.300 --> 01:32:55.850\n>> Yes, actually I just recently\nI had the opportunity listen\n\n1782\n01:32:55.850 --> 01:32:58.660\n>> To a bunch of different voices through\n\n1783\n01:32:58.660 --> 01:33:01.580\na speech thing.\n\n1784\n01:33:01.580 --> 01:33:05.440\nA bunch of different examples, and yeah,\nsome of them do sound much better,\n\n1785\n01:33:05.440 --> 01:33:08.030\nmore natural than others.\n\n1786\n01:33:08.030 --> 01:33:08.750\n>> Yeah.\n\n1787\n01:33:08.750 --> 01:33:11.670\nYou know I use them all the time.\n\n1788\n01:33:11.670 --> 01:33:13.430\nBecause when I'm driving.\n\n1789\n01:33:13.430 --> 01:33:16.820\nObviously you don't want to text\nwhile driving and things like that.\n\n1790\n01:33:16.820 --> 01:33:18.910\nAnd so I use text to speech a lot.\n\n1791\n01:33:18.910 --> 01:33:23.370\nSo if I get an email while I'm driving I\nhave my phone read out that text to me.\n\n1792\n01:33:23.370 --> 01:33:28.590\nAnd so I've probably been through 20\ndifferent voices in the last year\n\n1793\n01:33:28.590 --> 01:33:31.260\ntrying to find that voice that\nsounds the least robotic.\n\n1794\n01:33:31.260 --> 01:33:33.150\nAnd so that happens.\n\n1795\n01:33:33.150 --> 01:33:37.140\nIf this is something you need every\nsingle day You're gonna shop around and\n\n1796\n01:33:37.140 --> 01:33:39.190\nfind the one that works the best for you.\n\n1797\n01:33:40.510 --> 01:33:44.140\nUnfortunately some of the best support for\nthis is in the Windows world.\n\n1798\n01:33:44.140 --> 01:33:45.410\nRight, you know we have jaws and\n\n1799\n01:33:45.410 --> 01:33:47.700\napplications like that in the Windows\nworld just because Windows is such\n\n1800\n01:33:47.700 --> 01:33:51.055\na prominent operating system But\nthat doesn't mean you can't run Linux, and\n\n1801\n01:33:51.055 --> 01:33:54.405\nwe've got it in Linux also,\nso Orca is a great one.\n\n1802\n01:33:54.405 --> 01:33:56.245\nIt's probably the most popular, Emax,\n\n1803\n01:33:56.245 --> 01:33:59.595\nthere's other ones, you just find\nth ones that suit your needs.\n\n1804\n01:33:59.595 --> 01:34:01.855\nWell let's take a look at\nthis on an actual desktop.\n\n1805\n01:34:03.155 --> 01:34:06.075\nWhen we go to login to our desktop,\nand let me just log out.\n\n1806\n01:34:07.680 --> 01:34:09.540\nI'll log out of this system here.\n\n1807\n01:34:09.540 --> 01:34:14.240\nAll right, to get to the assistive\ntechnologies, when you're on the login\n\n1808\n01:34:14.240 --> 01:34:17.550\nscreen, we need to look for a little icon,\nand it'll be at the bottom right.\n\n1809\n01:34:17.550 --> 01:34:19.200\nSo when I go to log in to this machine,\n\n1810\n01:34:19.200 --> 01:34:22.650\nsee down here I've got this blue\ncircle with a little stick man in it?\n\n1811\n01:34:22.650 --> 01:34:24.800\nThat's the assistive technologies icon.\n\n1812\n01:34:24.800 --> 01:34:27.990\nAnd if I click on that I'm not\neven logged in yet, right?\n\n1813\n01:34:27.990 --> 01:34:29.220\nSo I'm at the login screen.\n\n1814\n01:34:29.220 --> 01:34:31.490\nIt's important we have this\nat the login screen, right?\n\n1815\n01:34:31.490 --> 01:34:34.880\nBecause we need people to be able to read,\nor interpret, or\n\n1816\n01:34:34.880 --> 01:34:38.070\ninteract with that login screen\nin whatever way works for them.\n\n1817\n01:34:38.070 --> 01:34:42.720\nAnd we can quickly turn on some of\nthe various Different options, right?\n\n1818\n01:34:42.720 --> 01:34:47.460\nI mentioned GOK,\nthe Gnome Onscreen Keyboard.\n\n1819\n01:34:47.460 --> 01:34:49.910\nAnd so I've got that right here,\nI can turn that on.\n\n1820\n01:34:49.910 --> 01:34:51.360\nAnd there's my onscreen keyboard.\n\n1821\n01:34:51.360 --> 01:34:56.660\nThis is useful if you're Using\nagain as an example like\n\n1822\n01:34:56.660 --> 01:35:01.010\na quadriplegic that might not be able to\ntype on a keyboard you might have a oral\n\n1823\n01:35:01.010 --> 01:35:04.790\nappliance that you use to tap on a touch\nscreen, and you'd be able to use this.\n\n1824\n01:35:04.790 --> 01:35:07.150\nWe're seeing this used on\ntablets a lot now, right.\n\n1825\n01:35:07.150 --> 01:35:10.890\nSo now it's not even a matter of having\na disability, just having device that\n\n1826\n01:35:10.890 --> 01:35:15.940\ndoesn't have a keyboard you can make use\nof that So that's the onscreen keyboard.\n\n1827\n01:35:15.940 --> 01:35:19.500\nYou may or\nmay not need that in your environment.\n\n1828\n01:35:19.500 --> 01:35:22.500\nWe've got this screen reader and\nthat's Orca that will turn on.\n\n1829\n01:35:22.500 --> 01:35:25.490\nAnd I don't think I have a sound card\nattached to this virtual machine, so\n\n1830\n01:35:25.490 --> 01:35:27.750\nI'm pretty sure it's not gonna talk.\n\n1831\n01:35:27.750 --> 01:35:29.690\nAlthough it is gonna think for a while.\n\n1832\n01:35:29.690 --> 01:35:32.570\n[LAUGH] If you want the screen\nreader to work, it's probably\n\n1833\n01:35:32.570 --> 01:35:36.450\na good idea to have a sound card,\nwhich I'm pretty sure I don't on this one.\n\n1834\n01:35:36.450 --> 01:35:40.730\nThere's the screen magnifier,\nwhich is incredibly useful because boy,\n\n1835\n01:35:40.730 --> 01:35:43.480\nscreen resolutions are getting higher and\nhigher.\n\n1836\n01:35:43.480 --> 01:35:47.570\nSo, if you are, not necessarily\nlegally blind but if you are just\n\n1837\n01:35:47.570 --> 01:35:51.188\nvisually impaired Impaired,\nif your vision is half as bad as mine is.\n\n1838\n01:35:51.188 --> 01:35:52.260\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Mine's pretty bad.\n\n1839\n01:35:52.260 --> 01:35:55.685\nI don't think you can see it on camera\nexactly how thick my classes are, but.\n\n1840\n01:35:55.685 --> 01:35:59.406\n[LAUGH] So if yours are as bad as mine,\nyou can use this screen magnifier,\n\n1841\n01:35:59.406 --> 01:36:00.532\nit's really handy.\n\n1842\n01:36:00.532 --> 01:36:02.705\nIt just follows your mouse,\nand it magnifies And\n\n1843\n01:36:02.705 --> 01:36:05.944\nyou'll see there's actually two\nlevels of magnification by default.\n\n1844\n01:36:05.944 --> 01:36:08.613\nSo I've got three panes on my screen here,\n\n1845\n01:36:08.613 --> 01:36:13.359\none that is magnified a decent amount and\none that's like super magnified,\n\n1846\n01:36:13.359 --> 01:36:18.800\nagain, trying to help me line up that\nmouse to be able to click and operate.\n\n1847\n01:36:18.800 --> 01:36:20.110\nHm.\n\n1848\n01:36:20.110 --> 01:36:22.461\nWe've got Enhance contrast in colors.\n\n1849\n01:36:22.461 --> 01:36:25.586\nYou'll see my screen goes mostly black and\nwhite.\n\n1850\n01:36:25.586 --> 01:36:31.752\nIf you have a visual impairment then this\nmake things really stand out, right.\n\n1851\n01:36:31.752 --> 01:36:37.136\nSo I know I had my Uncle Bud who had very,\nvery bad tunnel vision, and telling\n\n1852\n01:36:37.136 --> 01:36:42.710\nthe difference between subtle color\nvariations is not something he could do.\n\n1853\n01:36:42.710 --> 01:36:46.300\nUsing Enhance contrast\nin colors really helped.\n\n1854\n01:36:46.300 --> 01:36:47.850\nWe can also make text larger.\n\n1855\n01:36:47.850 --> 01:36:51.070\nI know a lot of people are doing that on\nhigh resolution monitors these days, and\n\n1856\n01:36:51.070 --> 01:36:53.050\nthat'll just make the general text bigger.\n\n1857\n01:36:53.050 --> 01:36:56.170\nThis is a great option, but\nit does cause problems with some software.\n\n1858\n01:36:56.170 --> 01:36:59.020\nA lot of software is not written\nto respect the setting and\n\n1859\n01:36:59.020 --> 01:37:00.120\nthat's an unfortunate thing.\n\n1860\n01:37:00.120 --> 01:37:03.710\nI do wish more software was\ncompatible with this stuff.\n\n1861\n01:37:03.710 --> 01:37:09.010\nBut you might see screen artifacts, things\nnot rendering properly, that does happen.\n\n1862\n01:37:09.010 --> 01:37:10.660\nAll right.\n\n1863\n01:37:10.660 --> 01:37:13.470\nYou'll see Sticky Keys is the next option.\n\n1864\n01:37:13.470 --> 01:37:15.990\nPress keyboard shortcuts\none key at a time.\n\n1865\n01:37:15.990 --> 01:37:20.820\nThat's where if I tap shift and let go,\nnow I'm actually holding the shift key,\n\n1866\n01:37:20.820 --> 01:37:22.250\neven though I'm not actually holding it.\n\n1867\n01:37:22.250 --> 01:37:25.690\nAnd with the very next key I press\nit'll enter it in as a capital letter.\n\n1868\n01:37:27.450 --> 01:37:30.880\nIgnore duplicate key presses,\nthat's the bounce keys and\n\n1869\n01:37:30.880 --> 01:37:34.330\nthen press and hold keys to accept them,\nthat's slow keys.\n\n1870\n01:37:34.330 --> 01:37:36.660\nSo in other words,\nif you just tap it that won't count.\n\n1871\n01:37:36.660 --> 01:37:40.340\nYou have to hold the key down\nbefore it registers it as a press.\n\n1872\n01:37:40.340 --> 01:37:45.360\nSo each of those are basically supporting\na different use case scenario.\n\n1873\n01:37:46.490 --> 01:37:49.200\n>> Now these options here,\nthese accessibility options,\n\n1874\n01:37:49.200 --> 01:37:51.795\nthese are baked into Gnome,\nwas that correct?\n\n1875\n01:37:51.795 --> 01:37:55.340\n>> Mm-hm, yep, with the default packages\nthat we installed here in the OS.\n\n1876\n01:37:55.340 --> 01:37:55.847\nYep.\n>> Nice.\n\n1877\n01:37:55.847 --> 01:37:56.520\n>> All right, so\n\n1878\n01:37:56.520 --> 01:37:58.706\nif I turn some of these things on.\nI'll go ahead and\n\n1879\n01:37:58.706 --> 01:38:00.920\nturn on, I'll do Sticky Keys.\n\n1880\n01:38:00.920 --> 01:38:03.940\nA lot of these have\nkeyboard shortcuts also.\n\n1881\n01:38:03.940 --> 01:38:06.770\nSo for example Sticky Keys,\nif I wanted to turn it on,\n\n1882\n01:38:06.770 --> 01:38:09.880\none of the things you can do is you\ncan tap the shift key five times.\n\n1883\n01:38:09.880 --> 01:38:12.590\nAnd when you tap it five times\nthat'll turn on Sticky Keys.\n\n1884\n01:38:12.590 --> 01:38:15.170\nSo, a lot of them have\nlittle shortcuts like that.\n\n1885\n01:38:15.170 --> 01:38:18.340\nAnd like everything in Linux there's\nalways more than one way to do stuff.\n\n1886\n01:38:18.340 --> 01:38:20.430\nThis is a really simple screen.\n\n1887\n01:38:20.430 --> 01:38:23.950\nIt's designed to get you what you need,\nso you can get logged in.\n\n1888\n01:38:23.950 --> 01:38:26.090\nOnce we're logged in,\nthere's actually more options.\n\n1889\n01:38:26.090 --> 01:38:26.950\nLet me show you those.\n\n1890\n01:38:28.220 --> 01:38:32.420\nSo I'm going to log in here, as dpizat,\nprobably need to punch in my password and\n\n1891\n01:38:32.420 --> 01:38:33.380\nnot my username.\n\n1892\n01:38:33.380 --> 01:38:35.050\nThere we go.\n\n1893\n01:38:35.050 --> 01:38:36.620\nSo I'll get logged in.\n\n1894\n01:38:36.620 --> 01:38:40.970\nOnce I'm logged in,\nI can go up to System, and\n\n1895\n01:38:40.970 --> 01:38:43.360\nPreferences and\nyou'll see Assistive Technologies.\n\n1896\n01:38:43.360 --> 01:38:45.805\nIt's the same icon the blue\ncircle with the stick man in it.\n\n1897\n01:38:45.805 --> 01:38:46.330\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1898\n01:38:46.330 --> 01:38:50.110\n>> And when we fire that up here's\nwhere we can start to do some advanced\n\n1899\n01:38:50.110 --> 01:38:50.960\ncustomizations.\n\n1900\n01:38:52.220 --> 01:38:55.530\nFor example under Assistive Technologies\nI've got Preferred Applications.\n\n1901\n01:38:55.530 --> 01:38:57.172\nAnd here's where I can\nset my screen reader.\n\n1902\n01:38:57.172 --> 01:38:59.390\nSee how I've got Orca chosen?\n\n1903\n01:38:59.390 --> 01:39:04.020\nI can do Orca with Magnifier,\nGNOME Magnifier, KDE Magnifier.\n\n1904\n01:39:04.020 --> 01:39:07.425\nIf I had installed a third party one,\nI could choose custom and\n\n1905\n01:39:07.425 --> 01:39:11.470\nchoose that other screen reader,\nor my visual enhancement here.\n\n1906\n01:39:11.470 --> 01:39:15.480\nAny mobility options that I might need,\nlike the onscreen keyboard, we can set\n\n1907\n01:39:15.480 --> 01:39:18.750\nthem to run at start, so they're\nautomatically running and waiting for us.\n\n1908\n01:39:18.750 --> 01:39:20.615\nSo we've got various functionality there.\n\n1909\n01:39:20.615 --> 01:39:22.310\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1910\n01:39:22.310 --> 01:39:23.730\nSo then Don, maybe this is, yeah.\n\n1911\n01:39:25.490 --> 01:39:28.790\nSo let's say that you don't\nhave GNOME installed, and\n\n1912\n01:39:28.790 --> 01:39:31.120\nyou are just running on\nthe straight up command line.\n\n1913\n01:39:31.120 --> 01:39:34.860\nIs there any kind of accessibility options\nthat we have just running like a straight\n\n1914\n01:39:34.860 --> 01:39:37.320\nup basic minimal install?\n\n1915\n01:39:37.320 --> 01:39:39.540\n>> It's much more limited,\nit's much more limited.\n\n1916\n01:39:39.540 --> 01:39:41.110\nI've never used that.\n\n1917\n01:39:41.110 --> 01:39:45.150\nSo from just a native command line,\na lot of this stuff,\n\n1918\n01:39:45.150 --> 01:39:48.240\nlike Orca depends on X Windows.\n\n1919\n01:39:48.240 --> 01:39:52.910\nAnd so it's really expecting to be in that\nGUI as part of the screen interpreter.\n\n1920\n01:39:52.910 --> 01:39:54.670\nThat's not to say that you can't.\n\n1921\n01:39:54.670 --> 01:39:55.680\nSomebody might make it.\n\n1922\n01:39:55.680 --> 01:39:57.530\nI'm just not familiar with it.\n\n1923\n01:39:57.530 --> 01:39:58.550\n>> Right on.\n\n1924\n01:39:58.550 --> 01:40:04.000\n>> My exposure, I personally don't have\na need for most of the assistive tools.\n\n1925\n01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:05.885\nMost of them.\nI do actually use one or two.\n\n1926\n01:40:05.885 --> 01:40:06.587\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1927\n01:40:06.587 --> 01:40:07.640\n>> But for most of them.\n\n1928\n01:40:07.640 --> 01:40:10.520\nBut I know I grew up with my Aunt Maureen,\nwho was deaf.\n\n1929\n01:40:10.520 --> 01:40:14.690\nAnd that's where I got exposed to a lot\nof this was through her needs, and\n\n1930\n01:40:14.690 --> 01:40:16.430\nhelping her get things set up.\n\n1931\n01:40:16.430 --> 01:40:19.940\nAnd my Uncle Bud,\nwho was severely visually impaired.\n\n1932\n01:40:19.940 --> 01:40:23.740\nSo you know it may not be you that\nhas specific need for these, but\n\n1933\n01:40:23.740 --> 01:40:27.930\nlearning to support them, man it is\nworthwhile because the moment that you\n\n1934\n01:40:27.930 --> 01:40:32.090\nfind somebody who needs that help,\nwhen you can take away that obstacle and\n\n1935\n01:40:32.090 --> 01:40:35.510\nlet them use a computer,\nthat's big deal, that really is.\n\n1936\n01:40:35.510 --> 01:40:40.290\nSo, we'll see other options in here\nlike our Keyboard accessibility options.\n\n1937\n01:40:40.290 --> 01:40:43.422\nHere we can go in and manually, not just\nturn the options on, but tweak them.\n\n1938\n01:40:43.422 --> 01:40:48.380\nSo like Slow Keys, how long do you have\nto hold the key for before it registers?\n\n1939\n01:40:48.380 --> 01:40:52.288\nOr Bounce Keys, how long do you wait\nto invalidate a double press, right?\n\n1940\n01:40:52.288 --> 01:40:57.490\nCuz that can get annoying if you're typing\na word like bookkeeper that has double Os,\n\n1941\n01:40:57.490 --> 01:41:00.500\ndouble Ks, double Es all in a row, right.\n\n1942\n01:41:00.500 --> 01:41:04.160\nIf you've got Bounce Keys turned on it's\nfrustrating to type a word like that.\n\n1943\n01:41:04.160 --> 01:41:05.690\nSo, adjusting those values.\n\n1944\n01:41:05.690 --> 01:41:07.930\nYou've also got things like Mouse Keys.\n\n1945\n01:41:07.930 --> 01:41:11.320\nSee how I've got Pointer can be\ncontrolled using the keypad?\n\n1946\n01:41:11.320 --> 01:41:15.080\nThat lets you use the arrow keys on your\nkeypad to move the mouse pointer instead\n\n1947\n01:41:15.080 --> 01:41:16.000\nof using your mouse.\n\n1948\n01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:20.291\nThat's a neat feature,\nif a mouse is not something you wanna use.\n\n1949\n01:41:21.450 --> 01:41:22.800\nYou can also do Typing Break.\n\n1950\n01:41:22.800 --> 01:41:25.780\nThis one I've never used,\nI think it's more for controlling kids.\n\n1951\n01:41:25.780 --> 01:41:30.810\nBut if you're worried about fatigue,\nif you don't want to\n\n1952\n01:41:30.810 --> 01:41:33.890\nhave somebody using a keyboard for\ntoo long, you can set it to lock\n\n1953\n01:41:33.890 --> 01:41:37.050\nyour workstation after a certain period\nof time and hold it locked for a while.\n\n1954\n01:41:37.050 --> 01:41:42.870\nSo basically enforcing breaks so that\nyou don't wear yourself out, all right?\n\n1955\n01:41:42.870 --> 01:41:44.570\nYou'll see a lot of other options in here.\n\n1956\n01:41:44.570 --> 01:41:47.190\nReally it is just a ton of options.\n\n1957\n01:41:47.190 --> 01:41:49.780\nAnd so it's a matter of finding\nthe ones that are right for\n\n1958\n01:41:49.780 --> 01:41:52.050\nthe scenario that you need.\n\n1959\n01:41:52.050 --> 01:41:56.470\n>> Having that one mouse one where you can\ncontrol your mouse cursor with the arrow\n\n1960\n01:41:56.470 --> 01:42:00.700\nkeys, I find that at times on my XPS,\nwhere I need something like that to help\n\n1961\n01:42:00.700 --> 01:42:02.126\nme get around the little-\n>> [LAUGH] Because\n\n1962\n01:42:02.126 --> 01:42:02.670\nyour touch pad is so bad.\n\n1963\n01:42:02.670 --> 01:42:04.280\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah, the touch pad on there.\n\n1964\n01:42:04.280 --> 01:42:04.970\nOn this one.\n>> Yeah.\n\n1965\n01:42:04.970 --> 01:42:09.050\nIt just goes to show these assistive\ntechnologies, they're for everyone.\n\n1966\n01:42:09.050 --> 01:42:10.180\nAnybody can benefit from these.\n\n1967\n01:42:10.180 --> 01:42:14.130\nAnybody who is having difficulties\ninteracting with that desktop.\n\n1968\n01:42:14.130 --> 01:42:17.810\nBecause just because there's\na common use scenario\n\n1969\n01:42:17.810 --> 01:42:20.020\ndoesn't mean that's the use\nscenario that fits for you.\n\n1970\n01:42:20.020 --> 01:42:22.790\nYou may need to adjust\nthings to meet your needs.\n\n1971\n01:42:22.790 --> 01:42:23.630\nAll right.\n\n1972\n01:42:23.630 --> 01:42:27.180\nSo those are the basics of\nthe assistive technologies.\n\n1973\n01:42:27.180 --> 01:42:28.720\nThere are more out there.\n\n1974\n01:42:28.720 --> 01:42:30.400\nThere's tons, third party ones.\n\n1975\n01:42:30.400 --> 01:42:33.390\nThere's a lot of great websites out there\nthat catalog different software that's\n\n1976\n01:42:33.390 --> 01:42:35.770\navailable and you can make use of that.\n\n1977\n01:42:35.770 --> 01:42:39.420\nDon't ever feel like you shouldn't\nbe able to use a computer.\n\n1978\n01:42:39.420 --> 01:42:42.419\nThere's the tools to make it happen, it's\njust a matter of putting them together.\n\n1979\n01:42:42.419 --> 01:42:46.843\nAnd unfortunately a lot of vendors out\nthere haven't taken the time to make their\n\n1980\n01:42:46.843 --> 01:42:49.966\nsoftware compliant and so\nit may be a bit of a challenge but\n\n1981\n01:42:49.966 --> 01:42:51.479\nit can definitely be done.\n\n1982\n01:42:53.020 --> 01:42:54.202\n>> All right, nice.\n\n1983\n01:42:54.202 --> 01:42:57.530\n>> All right, so I think that's\nabout it for assistive technologies.\n\n1984\n01:42:57.530 --> 01:43:01.570\nAnd really that's about it for\nthe graphical user interface.\n\n1985\n01:43:01.570 --> 01:43:06.340\nRemember the GUI only makes\nup 8% of the second exam.\n\n1986\n01:43:06.340 --> 01:43:07.920\nSo the first exam is all CLI.\n\n1987\n01:43:07.920 --> 01:43:12.378\nThe second Exam is 92% CLI.\n\n1988\n01:43:12.378 --> 01:43:14.790\nSo we don't spend a ton of time in here.\n\n1989\n01:43:14.790 --> 01:43:17.160\nSo we're just gonna have the one\nepisode here on the GUI.\n\n1990\n01:43:17.160 --> 01:43:19.110\nI think we've covered\na decent bit of stuff.\n\n1991\n01:43:19.110 --> 01:43:22.100\nMost of the things people\nwant to know anyway.\n\n1992\n01:43:22.100 --> 01:43:23.510\n>> Yeah.\n>> All right,\n\n1993\n01:43:23.510 --> 01:43:28.750\nwell let me just remind everybody that if\nyou ever have any questions on this stuff,\n\n1994\n01:43:28.750 --> 01:43:31.360\nlive during the show you\ncan go to itpro.tv/live.\n\n1995\n01:43:31.360 --> 01:43:34.560\nYou'll see the chat box\nright beneath our

right.\n\n2009\n01:44:05.430 --> 01:44:07.040\nThat's not the way you wanna go about it.\n\n2010\n01:44:07.040 --> 01:44:09.695\nSo, they'll have plenty of them\nin the exam room for you already.\n\n2011\n01:44:09.695 --> 01:44:11.400\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right.\n\n2012\n01:44:11.400 --> 01:44:12.770\nWell, I hope you guys enjoyed the show.\n\n2013\n01:44:12.770 -->

morning.\n\n8\n00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:50.960\nPaul McCartney, is going back on\ntour after suffering a little delay,\n\n9\n00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.272\nso apparently, age or\nsomething else is catching up with fall.\n\n10\n00:00:55.272 --> 00:00:57.755\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> He's only what, 99 years old?\n\n11\n00:00:57.755 --> 00:00:58.379\nSomething like that.\n\n12\n00:00:58.379 --> 00:00:59.046\n[LAUGH]\n>> Something, yeah.\n\n13\n00:00:59.046 --> 00:01:02.846\nIt's a slow news day when it's Paul\nMcCartney news, cuz he goes on tour again\n\n14\n00:01:02.846 --> 00:01:04.425\nevery week or so [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, yeah.\n\n15\n00:01:04.425 --> 00:01:05.650\nSo there you go.\n\n16\n00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:06.460\nAll right.\n\n17\n00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.285\nWell, speaking of things that\nhappen entirely too often.\n\n18\n00:01:09.285 --> 00:01:12.330\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We're gonna be doing administrative\n\n19\n00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.480\ntasks in this episode.\n\n20\n00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:16.750\nWe're gonna take a look at some\nof the routine activities that we\n\n21\n00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:17.690\nneed to perform.\n\n22\n00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.810\nAnd we'll even see how to schedule some\nof this to make them happen automatically\n\n23\n00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.935\nlike Paul McCartney is\ncoming out of retirement.\n\n24\n00:01:23.935 --> 00:01:27.330\nOr reunion tour or\nwhatever that he does every two years.\n\n25\n00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.165\n>> That's right.\n\n26\n00:01:28.165 --> 00:01:31.044\n>> [LAUGH] I honestly thought he was dead.\n\n27\n00:01:31.044 --> 00:01:32.499\n[LAUGH] Anyhow.\n\n28\n00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:33.960\n>> [LAUGH] Not yet.\n\n29\n00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.780\n>> All right, let's take a stab\nat some administrative tasks.\n\n30\n00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.860\nAnd we're gonna revisit some things that\nwe've already kind of seen a little bit,\n\n31\n00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.880\nbut just look at them\nin a little more depth.\n\n32\n00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.667\nOne of the main things is,\nyou might have noticed, that we are,\n\n33\n00:01:47.667 --> 00:01:51.540\nwell if you are watching this live,\nwe are a week and a half into the show.\n\n34\n00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.180\nAnd if you are not watching it\nlive then maybe we are months in.\n\n35\n00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:55.910\nI don't know.\n\n36\n00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:00.410\nBut all this time, I've been logging into\nmy machine, most of the time, as root.\n\n37\n00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:03.060\nAnd I've said several times\nthat's not a good idea.\n\n38\n00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.650\nAnd we are gonna talk in the Security\nepisode how to get around and\n\n39\n00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:07.630\nhow we're supposed to properly do it.\n\n40\n00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.280\nBut for right now,\nI had been logged in as that user.\n\n41\n00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.300\nNow, I've created a few other user\naccounts as the course of this show\n\n42\n00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.170\nhas gone on and I'm usually just doing it\nquickly or we wrote that little script.\n\n43\n00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.110\nWe didn't really talk about the command\nthat made the user account.\n\n44\n00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.295\nToday, we're gonna look at\nthat in a little more depth.\n\n45\n00:02:23.295 --> 00:02:27.050\nThere's some things that we need to\nunderstand about how user accounts work\n\n46\n00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:31.300\nand how groups work and how we can\nassign people and various things there.\n\n47\n00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.740\nSo that is an important thing for\nus to understand, and\n\n48\n00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:36.040\nthat is where we're going\nto start off today.\n\n49\n00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.030\n>> That's great.\n\n50\n00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.940\n>> So, just to kind of rehash\na little bit of some of the things\n\n51\n00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.430\nwe talked about before, when we access\na file there are permissions and\n\n52\n00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.910\nthe permissions apply to\none of three things, right.\n\n53\n00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.090\nThey apply to,\nthe user who created the file or folder.\n\n54\n00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:53.910\nRight.\nSo, the user created it.\n\n55\n00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.140\nThey're basically the owner.\n\n56\n00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.640\nAnd then you got the group\nassigned to the file.\n\n57\n00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.490\nAnybody in that group is allowed\nto have certain permissions.\n\n58\n00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:04.420\nAnd then there's the others.\n\n59\n00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:05.720\nRight.\nEverybody else.\n\n60\n00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.560\nAnybody else and the access they get,\nso I just remember it as U-G-O,\n\n61\n00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.760\nuser, group, others, right, those\nare the three permissions we set on files.\n\n62\n00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.370\nWell, for users to be effective,\nwe've gotta have users.\n\n63\n00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:20.680\nIf root is all we have,\nthen we're not gonna get very far in life.\n\n64\n00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.860\nAnd then if we wanna make use of groups,\nwell we've gotta create some.\n\n65\n00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:26.530\nAnd sure, there's some system\ngroups that are created but,\n\n66\n00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.450\nthey're really not designed for us to use.\n\n67\n00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:30.020\nThey're designed for the system to use.\n\n68\n00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:31.070\nThey're system groups.\n\n69\n00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:34.210\nSo, we really need to make our way\nown groups to customize permission to\n\n70\n00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.970\nmanipulate things.\n\n71\n00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:38.000\nSo, those are some of the things\nwe need to be aware of.\n\n72\n00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.337\nWe took a look at a C-H-O-W-N,\nChange Owner Command.\n\n73\n00:03:44.337 --> 00:03:46.460\nChown, is what you hear\na lot of people call it.\n\n74\n00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:50.120\nBut the change owner command,\nwhere we can change the user or\n\n75\n00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.240\nthe group attached to a file or folder.\n\n76\n00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:56.450\nBut, if we haven't created\nthe supporting users and\n\n77\n00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:00.020\ngroups yet, it's not very effective and\nnot a whole lot of point in doing it.\n\n78\n00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:01.939\nSo, that's what we're gonna\nlook at this morning.\n\n79\n00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:07.020\nNow, in the last episode we\ncovered graphical user interfaces.\n\n80\n00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:09.270\nAnd I made a bunch of changes\nto my virtual machine.\n\n81\n00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:12.650\nAnd what I decided was this morning,\nI would just start from scratch.\n\n82\n00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:14.910\nSo, I just wiped it and\nbrought up an all new VM.\n\n83\n00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:21.800\nSo I'm back to just having a nice,\nplain, text-only install, Linux.\n\n84\n00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:24.260\nAnd it's still CentOS, I stuck with that.\n\n85\n00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:28.660\nBut the only user account that I\nhave right now, is the root account.\n\n86\n00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:31.670\nAll right, now how do I know\nwhat user accounts I have?\n\n87\n00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:35.520\nWell there are more than just one user\naccount on your system typically, right?\n\n88\n00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.530\nA lot of times there is other ones\nthat are created by the system and\n\n89\n00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:39.330\nwe can see them.\n\n90\n00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.232\nWe actually get to see\na little UNIX history here,\n\n91\n00:04:42.232 --> 00:04:46.740\nback in the day, your UNIX user accounts.\n\n92\n00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:50.480\nWhen you had your user accounts and\npassword, where all stored in one file.\n\n93\n00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:55.750\nIt was /etc/passwd,\nthat file right there, right?\n\n94\n00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:01.870\nAnd that file still exists,\nif I do more /etc/passwd.\n\n95\n00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:06.540\nThe file exist and\nhere is the list of my user accounts.\n\n96\n00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:07.500\nOkay?\n\n97\n00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:10.630\nNow, when we look at the user\naccounts route is the very first one.\n\n98\n00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:13.040\nSo, I see route right there.\n\n99\n00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:15.560\nRight.\nAnd then after I see all of these\n\n100\n00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.290\nother accounts that I didn't create.\n\n101\n00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:18.630\nRight.\nI didn't make these.\n\n102\n00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:20.580\nWell, this are part of default install.\n\n103\n00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:24.100\nI just did a quick and\ndirty default install this morning,\n\n104\n00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:27.300\nthe only thing I changed on it was to\nturn the network adapter on, right?\n\n105\n00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:32.010\nOtherwise it was all defaults the whole\nway, so these are ones that CentOS and\n\n106\n00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:35.300\nRed Hat also, just creates by default.\n\n107\n00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:38.990\nAnd you'll see there are accounts\ntied to various things, so lp,\n\n108\n00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:44.660\nwe're gonna talk about later, that's for\nprinting, shut down, halt, mail.\n\n109\n00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:47.560\nEach of these have different purposes\nusually tied to different services\n\n110\n00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:49.380\nthat are running on your system.\n\n111\n00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:50.650\nSome of them are tied to services\n\n112\n00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:52.650\nyou might not actually be running,\nlike Gopher.\n\n113\n00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:56.730\nYour system might have support for Gopher,\nit might even have the services installed,\n\n114\n00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:58.320\nbut not likely turned on.\n\n115\n00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:01.360\nBecause Gopher is ancient and\nmost people don't need it, but\n\n116\n00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:04.660\nyou'll see other ones in here\nthat are used all the time.\n\n117\n00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:07.740\nDbus, haldaemon, ntp a lot of those,\n\n118\n00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:10.780\na lot of them we're actually going\nto work with later on in the show.\n\n119\n00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:16.080\nThe way this file is structured\nit's pretty straight forward.\n\n120\n00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:19.830\nWhat you have is the, actually let\nme get back up to the top of it.\n\n121\n00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:24.060\nThere we go.\n\n122\n00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:28.950\nI'm just gonna, kinda, clean it up so I\ndon't have to, here let me do this, there.\n\n123\n00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:32.776\nI'm just gonna pull it up and see,\nI'm just feeding it through grep, so\n\n124\n00:06:32.776 --> 00:06:36.190\nthat, I can get just the root account,\nthat's all I wanna see.\n\n125\n00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:38.890\nAnd so I can see right here,\nI've got the root user and\n\n126\n00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:41.990\nthe way the fields work out are like this,\nyou've got the username, so\n\n127\n00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:46.180\nthat's the name of the user and\nit used to be followed by the password.\n\n128\n00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:49.780\nThe password was actually written\nright here, this was their password.\n\n129\n00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:53.300\nAnd then over time, they started to\nencrypt it, and things changed, and\n\n130\n00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:54.900\nso now there's just an X.\n\n131\n00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:57.160\nAnd the X is kind of like a placeholder,\n\n132\n00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:01.940\nsaying the password used to be here,\nnow it's somewhere else.\n\n133\n00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:05.360\nAnd then it was followed by the user ID,\nthe UID.\n\n134\n00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:09.000\nEvery user that gets created has\nan ID number attached to them.\n\n135\n00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.790\nThe root user is the very first one,\nso it's normally zero.\n\n136\n00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:16.430\nIt doesn't have to be,\ndistributions can change that,\n\n137\n00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:20.250\nbut it's rare that they change it,\nit usually is zero.\n\n138\n00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:23.590\nUser accounts that we create\nnormally start at 500.\n\n139\n00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:28.070\nAnd so you'll see 500, 501, 502,\nit skips a big chunk at the beginning.\n\n140\n00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:30.860\nIt's leaving that big chunk at\nthe beginning for service accounts and\n\n141\n00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:33.420\nautomated system accounts things\nthat are created by the installs.\n\n142\n00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:34.910\nThat's what you normally see.\n\n143\n00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:37.130\nAgain, there's not\na strict rule about that.\n\n144\n00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:40.210\nDistros can choose to deviate from it,\nbut it's a pretty common thing.\n\n145\n00:07:41.825 --> 00:07:46.585\nThen, a little bit later we'll see\nthe group that we're a member of, so here,\n\n146\n00:07:46.585 --> 00:07:48.385\nI could see root, right.\n\n147\n00:07:48.385 --> 00:07:52.397\nWhen we create a user by default,\na group is created with their same name.\n\n148\n00:07:52.397 --> 00:07:55.721\nSo there's a root user, and\nthere's a root group, and\n\n149\n00:07:55.721 --> 00:07:59.136\nanything that root creates\nwill be tied to both of those.\n\n150\n00:07:59.136 --> 00:08:03.307\nAnd so, that makes it where that\none user has his access and\n\n151\n00:08:03.307 --> 00:08:06.729\nnobody else does,\nhe is the user and the group.\n\n152\n00:08:06.729 --> 00:08:11.348\nBut, if I were to fire this person,\nwell you can't fire a root, but\n\n153\n00:08:11.348 --> 00:08:15.659\nif this were Bob Smith, and\nI fire them, I could take John Doe.\n\n154\n00:08:15.659 --> 00:08:19.451\nAnd I could put John Doe in the Bob Smith\ngroup, and now John Doe would have access\n\n155\n00:08:19.451 --> 00:08:22.010\nto those things that Bob Smith\nhad been working with.\n\n156\n00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:25.670\nSo, that's why that group is\ncreated that matches the usernames,\n\n157\n00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:26.960\nthat's done automatically.\n\n158\n00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:27.750\nBut it doesn't have to be.\n\n159\n00:08:27.750 --> 00:08:30.430\nYou can put somebody\nin any group you want.\n\n160\n00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:34.080\nThis right here,\nthis is their default group.\n\n161\n00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:38.180\nThe primary group that they're in,\nthe primary or default group.\n\n162\n00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:40.900\nThey can be a member of many other,\n\n163\n00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:43.410\nthey can be a member of 20 other\ngroups if you want, right?\n\n164\n00:08:43.410 --> 00:08:45.330\nThose are called secondary groups.\n\n165\n00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:50.420\nSo in the past wd file we're just\nseeing their primary or default group.\n\n166\n00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:54.250\nSo as they create files and folders that's\nthe group that's gonna be attached to.\n\n167\n00:08:54.250 --> 00:08:54.870\nAll right?\n\n168\n00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:56.612\nThen we see their home directory.\n\n169\n00:08:56.612 --> 00:09:00.210\nSo, /root,\nthat's the home directory for this guy.\n\n170\n00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:03.740\nIf I create a user account for myself\nit will be slash home slash username,\n\n171\n00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:07.000\nthat's the default location\nof that home directory.\n\n172\n00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.860\nAnd then the last part\nhere is their shell.\n\n173\n00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:13.950\nI can see that root is\ndefaulting to /bin/bash and\n\n174\n00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:17.540\nthat means when they log in,\nif they request a shell instance or\n\n175\n00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:20.620\ninteractive instance,\nthey'll get the bash shell, right?\n\n176\n00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:22.760\nPeople can change their default shell,\nthey can choose,\n\n177\n00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:28.470\nmaybe they really love TCSH or they really\nlove ZSH and they wanna use that one,\n\n178\n00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:30.460\nthey can change their default shell and\nthat's what they'll get.\n\n179\n00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:32.740\nAll right.\n\n180\n00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:34.659\nNow, notice this guy down here, operator.\n\n181\n00:09:34.659 --> 00:09:38.090\nOperator's one of those system\naccounts and I can see,\n\n182\n00:09:38.090 --> 00:09:42.326\nuser name is in a group with the same\nname, /root is the home folder.\n\n183\n00:09:42.326 --> 00:09:47.034\nThat's why operator turned up in my grep\nhere because root is their home folder.\n\n184\n00:09:47.034 --> 00:09:49.629\nThis is a service account, and so\nit doesn't really need its own home\n\n185\n00:09:49.629 --> 00:09:52.130\ndirectory, and so it's just kind\nof attached itself to /root.\n\n186\n00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:58.060\nLook at that shell, though,\n/sbin/nologin, all right.\n\n187\n00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:02.060\nThis is a classic example of how\nwe can secure service accounts.\n\n188\n00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:05.290\nIf a hacker can get into your\nsystem as a service account,\n\n189\n00:10:05.290 --> 00:10:07.100\noftentimes they'll have\nelevated permissions.\n\n190\n00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:09.780\nThey'll be able to do things\nyou don't want them to do.\n\n191\n00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:14.100\nSo by setting the shell to\n/sbin/nologin that says\n\n192\n00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:16.890\ndon't let this guy login and get a shell.\n\n193\n00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:20.560\nThey can authenticate to perform actions.\n\n194\n00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:23.210\nBut they can't request\nan interactive shell.\n\n195\n00:10:23.210 --> 00:10:27.530\nSo now, they're limited to just the\nactions that software's capable of doing.\n\n196\n00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:31.560\nSo, if it is, send mail or MySQL or\n\n197\n00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:34.860\nwhatever, it's limited to the stuff\nthat MySQL or sendmail can normally do.\n\n198\n00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:36.320\nIt won't be able to create a shell,\n\n199\n00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:39.060\nwhich then opens you up to all\nsorts of other possibilities.\n\n200\n00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:41.850\nSo that's a great way to secure things,\nright?\n\n201\n00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:44.820\nNow, this file was pretty straightforward.\n\n202\n00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:47.430\nSo you might be tempted\nto directly edit it.\n\n203\n00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:50.020\nAnd I will tell you\nthat's not a good idea.\n\n204\n00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:53.500\nYou don't want to edit this file\ndirectly if you can avoid it.\n\n205\n00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:56.590\nIn fact, really the root user is\nthe only one who even could and\n\n206\n00:10:56.590 --> 00:10:58.090\neven then it's not a good idea.\n\n207\n00:10:58.090 --> 00:11:00.850\nInstead we have a series\nof commands we use\n\n208\n00:11:00.850 --> 00:11:03.710\nthat allow us to modify what is\nin here and to do it safely.\n\n209\n00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:05.180\nAnd that's the way we wanna do it.\n\n210\n00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:08.705\nSo while this file does look very simple,\ndo yourself a favor and\n\n211\n00:11:08.705 --> 00:11:12.450\ndon't edit it directly unless you\nreally know what you're doing.\n\n212\n00:11:12.450 --> 00:11:17.117\nNow, the one piece of information that\nis missing from here is the password.\n\n213\n00:11:17.117 --> 00:11:19.620\nAnd the password is just and\nX, right here.\n\n214\n00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:21.135\nAnd I know that's not the right password,\n\n215\n00:11:21.135 --> 00:11:22.701\nalthough it would be\nkind of funny if it was.\n\n216\n00:11:22.701 --> 00:11:26.557\nBut that's not the right password,\nso, where the password stores.\n\n217\n00:11:26.557 --> 00:11:31.650\nWell, /etc/passwd is kinda in the name,\nlike well password.\n\n218\n00:11:31.650 --> 00:11:34.790\nBut it became just a super target for\nattackers.\n\n219\n00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:37.230\nIf you broke into a system,\nthat was the file you went for.\n\n220\n00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:40.510\nIf you could get that file,\nyou then had all the accounts and\n\n221\n00:11:40.510 --> 00:11:42.560\nyou could really break into that system.\n\n222\n00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:46.480\nSo, what they did is that they shifted\nthe passwords out and move them over to\n\n223\n00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:52.170\nanother file that has very very strict\nrules and permissions assigned to it.\n\n224\n00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:57.037\nIt's much more heavily protected and\nthe passwords these days are now gnawing\n\n225\n00:11:57.037 --> 00:12:01.992\nencrypted, they sorted also so that\nthey're very strong one way encryption.\n\n226\n00:12:01.992 --> 00:12:08.076\nSo, if we take a look at that,\nthat's actually in /etc/shadow.\n\n227\n00:12:08.076 --> 00:12:09.930\nWe have what's called the shadow file.\n\n228\n00:12:09.930 --> 00:12:10.890\nAll right?\n\n229\n00:12:10.890 --> 00:12:11.600\nThe shadow,\n\n230\n00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:15.890\nit's like it doesn't, who knows what\nevil lurks in the hearts of men?\n\n231\n00:12:15.890 --> 00:12:17.993\nThe shadow radio show.\n\n232\n00:12:17.993 --> 00:12:21.240\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Now that I think about that joke.\n\n233\n00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:22.420\nSo the radio is this thing.\n\n234\n00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:23.284\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n235\n00:12:23.284 --> 00:12:23.801\n>> We have so\n\n236\n00:12:23.801 --> 00:12:27.117\nmany younger viewers who don't\nrealize about radio shows.\n\n237\n00:12:27.117 --> 00:12:27.992\n>> Radio shows, yeah.\n\n238\n00:12:27.992 --> 00:12:32.230\n>> So, anyhow, we have this shadow\nfile and if we take a look at that,\n\n239\n00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:35.420\nyou'll notice that it's\na little bit messier.\n\n240\n00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:36.520\n>> Yeah.\n>> Right?\n\n241\n00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:43.802\nAnd let me just clean this up a bit and\ngrab that for root, there we go.\n\n242\n00:12:43.802 --> 00:12:46.990\nAll right, so, when I see the line come\nback from my root account what do I see?\n\n243\n00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:48.992\nWell, I see the user account.\n\n244\n00:12:48.992 --> 00:12:49.640\nRight here.\n\n245\n00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:51.800\nSo user account is root.\n\n246\n00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:57.560\nFollowed by dollar sign six dollar sign\nwhich lets me know this is a seeded hash.\n\n247\n00:12:57.560 --> 00:13:01.020\nAnd then I can see right after\nthat a bunch of mess, right?\n\n248\n00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:03.370\nI mean, this is the hash for my password.\n\n249\n00:13:03.370 --> 00:13:05.550\nNow, my root password,\n\n250\n00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:08.990\nI'm gonna tell it to you guys because\nthat's good security practice too.\n\n251\n00:13:08.990 --> 00:13:11.770\nMy root password is the word password,\nall lowercase.\n\n252\n00:13:11.770 --> 00:13:15.460\nI picked a very, very weak password\ncuz this is a lab machine.\n\n253\n00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:16.930\nAnd so I'm not worried about\nit getting broken into.\n\n254\n00:13:16.930 --> 00:13:19.570\nSo, it's just the word\npassword all lower case.\n\n255\n00:13:19.570 --> 00:13:21.850\nBut you wouldn't know\nthat looking at this.\n\n256\n00:13:21.850 --> 00:13:27.520\nThis makes it look like my password is\ninsanely complex but in reality, it isn't.\n\n257\n00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:28.520\nOkay?\n\n258\n00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:30.250\nIt's a very simple password and\n\n259\n00:13:30.250 --> 00:13:34.070\nthis is just a encrypted hash\nrepresenting my password.\n\n260\n00:13:35.310 --> 00:13:37.380\nBut the other values that are in here.\n\n261\n00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:39.290\nThey're really strange.\n\n262\n00:13:39.290 --> 00:13:42.911\nAnd I'll be honest with you, I don't have\nexactly the placeholders memorized, but\n\n263\n00:13:42.911 --> 00:13:43.826\nI know what they are.\n\n264\n00:13:43.826 --> 00:13:48.272\nThese are indicators of\nhow old my password is,\n\n265\n00:13:48.272 --> 00:13:51.284\nwhen my password has to change.\n\n266\n00:13:51.284 --> 00:13:56.000\nHow long has it been since I changed my\npassword last would be the password age.\n\n267\n00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.367\nHow old my password is allowed to get.\n\n268\n00:13:58.367 --> 00:14:03.406\nThose general policy type thins and\nthe reason I don't have them\n\n269\n00:14:03.406 --> 00:14:09.951\nmemorized is because they are measured\nnumber of days since some date in 1970.\n\n270\n00:14:09.951 --> 00:14:12.590\nIt's some bizarre time\nmeasurement that it does.\n\n271\n00:14:12.590 --> 00:14:15.860\nAnd, I'm sure it makes sense to whoever\nthe developer was that created it, but\n\n272\n00:14:15.860 --> 00:14:18.510\nto us looking at it here,\nit doesn't make a lot of sense.\n\n273\n00:14:18.510 --> 00:14:21.380\nI do know this 99999, right?\n\n274\n00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:23.550\nThat's my maximum password age.\n\n275\n00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:25.780\nThat means my password\ncannot set to expire.\n\n276\n00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:31.310\nMy password could be 99,999 days old and\nit's not going to expire.\n\n277\n00:14:31.310 --> 00:14:35.270\nSo, this is more than likely\nmy current password age\n\n278\n00:14:35.270 --> 00:14:37.860\nmeasured since that date in 1970.\n\n279\n00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:42.440\nAnd here's the maximum age that my\npassword will be allowed to get to.\n\n280\n00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:47.160\nSo these are some of the things, and then\nI believe, don't quote me on this one, but\n\n281\n00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:49.160\nI believe seven is the minimum\npassword length, so\n\n282\n00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:52.040\nmy password has to be at\nleast seven characters.\n\n283\n00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:54.510\nThese are just defaults,\nwe can manipulate this stuff, and\n\n284\n00:14:54.510 --> 00:14:57.840\nagain, you might be temped\nto add a shadow file, but.\n\n285\n00:14:57.840 --> 00:14:59.370\nDon't, it's a bad idea.\n\n286\n00:14:59.370 --> 00:15:03.120\nUsually, you don't have the ability\nto edit the shadow file anyway.\n\n287\n00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:05.010\nBut even if you could, don't.\n\n288\n00:15:05.010 --> 00:15:08.240\nWe've got command line utilities we can\nuse to safely interact with this file.\n\n289\n00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:12.420\nAll right, so,\nwhen we create a user account,\n\n290\n00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:16.320\nthere's really three things that are\nhappening when we create a user account.\n\n291\n00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:20.720\nThe first thing is they get\nan entry in Slash etc slash passwd.\n\n292\n00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:23.770\nSo, that's kind of the first part,\n\n293\n00:15:23.770 --> 00:15:27.580\nthey get a user account entity,\nor entry created there.\n\n294\n00:15:27.580 --> 00:15:28.310\nAll right?\n\n295\n00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:34.140\nThe second part is their password\ngets stored in /etc/shadow.\n\n296\n00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:35.140\nAll right.\n\n297\n00:15:35.140 --> 00:15:37.930\nSo, there's the second\npart of creating a user.\n\n298\n00:15:37.930 --> 00:15:40.530\nAnd then the third part is\nthey get a home directory and\n\n299\n00:15:40.530 --> 00:15:45.047\nthe default is it would be /home/username,\nright?\n\n300\n00:15:45.047 --> 00:15:49.935\nAnd remember that home directory\nthey get is really a copy of\n\n301\n00:15:49.935 --> 00:15:55.450\n/etc/skel, the skeleton folder, right?\n\n302\n00:15:55.450 --> 00:15:59.948\nSo, whatever's in that folder gets copied\nto become the user folder and we saw that,\n\n303\n00:15:59.948 --> 00:16:02.201\nwas that last episode, two episodes ago?\n\n304\n00:16:02.201 --> 00:16:03.232\n>> Two episodes.\n>> Wasn't long, so\n\n305\n00:16:03.232 --> 00:16:06.004\nwe've already seen that in the show but\nif you haven't,\n\n306\n00:16:06.004 --> 00:16:08.154\nit's just the template folder basically.\n\n307\n00:16:08.154 --> 00:16:10.864\nWhatever is in there gets copied\nto create a new user folder.\n\n308\n00:16:10.864 --> 00:16:14.398\nSo if there is something you want to\nbe present in all of your user folders,\n\n309\n00:16:14.398 --> 00:16:16.580\nyou can use that skeleton folder.\n\n310\n00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:21.946\nFor example,\nmaybe if we go in here and look,\n\n311\n00:16:21.946 --> 00:16:26.360\nyou'll see like -rc and stuff like that,\nso you'll see these entries in there.\n\n312\n00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:30.100\nMaybe I want to have a few\ndefault directories.\n\n313\n00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:34.970\nI wanna have a Documents directory,\nI wanna have a Music directory,\n\n314\n00:16:34.970 --> 00:16:37.420\nI wanna have a Videos directory.\n\n315\n00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:40.170\nSo these are different things\nthat I want people to have\n\n316\n00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:44.430\nwhen they get a new folder, okay?\n\n317\n00:16:44.430 --> 00:16:45.350\nSo I can whip these up.\n\n318\n00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:49.660\nNow notice all of these are owned by me,\nowned by root, right?\n\n319\n00:16:49.660 --> 00:16:52.990\nSo we've got an owner and\na group of root and that's fine.\n\n320\n00:16:52.990 --> 00:16:56.560\nWhen it copies the skeleton folder\nover to create their home folder,\n\n321\n00:16:56.560 --> 00:17:00.340\nit'll change the ownership of these files\nto match user you're creating, right?\n\n322\n00:17:00.340 --> 00:17:02.970\nSo these are the three things\nthat happened when we create\n\n323\n00:17:02.970 --> 00:17:04.650\na user account, right?\n\n324\n00:17:04.650 --> 00:17:06.710\nLet's see it in action, all right.\n\n325\n00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:10.220\nI'm gonna do useradd, right,\nthat's the command we use for\n\n326\n00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:12.140\ncreating a new user account.\n\n327\n00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:17.010\nI'll do useradd dpezet,\nthat's the simplest form of this command.\n\n328\n00:17:17.010 --> 00:17:19.384\nThere's a lot of other little\ntags that we can use with it.\n\n329\n00:17:19.384 --> 00:17:23.880\nBut this is the simplest form of\nthe command, just user add and\n\n330\n00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:25.250\nthen a name, right?\n\n331\n00:17:25.250 --> 00:17:27.230\nThat's gonna create a user\naccount called dpezet.\n\n332\n00:17:28.710 --> 00:17:32.620\nWhen that happened I\ngot an entry in passwd.\n\n333\n00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:38.000\nSo if I take a look at passwd and\nI will grep that for dpezet.\n\n334\n00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:40.980\nThere I am, okay.\n\n335\n00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:44.310\nMy user ID, I'm the very first user,\nI'm user ID 500, right?\n\n336\n00:17:44.310 --> 00:17:45.820\nMy password is an x.\n\n337\n00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:50.070\nI can see I'm not in any groups,\nit didn't put me in one.\n\n338\n00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:56.730\nMy home directory is /home/dpezet and\nmy default shell is bin/bash.\n\n339\n00:17:56.730 --> 00:18:00.080\nAnd if I take a look at /home/dpezet,\n\n340\n00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:05.240\nactually I'll do a -la so\nI can see everything.\n\n341\n00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:09.964\nI can see in that home folder,\nI've got documents, music, videos.\n\n342\n00:18:09.964 --> 00:18:13.245\nRight they're there, they're copied\nfrom that skeleton folder and\n\n343\n00:18:13.245 --> 00:18:15.368\nall of the files are owned by dpezet,\nright?\n\n344\n00:18:15.368 --> 00:18:16.620\nExcept for dot dot.\n\n345\n00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:20.150\nDot dot is pointing to the home\ndirectory/home and that's own by root.\n\n346\n00:18:20.150 --> 00:18:23.110\nBut everything else,\ndot which is this directory.\n\n347\n00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:27.996\nMy bash files and\nthose folders are owned by me, dpezet.\n\n348\n00:18:27.996 --> 00:18:29.409\nAll right?\n\n349\n00:18:29.409 --> 00:18:33.080\nNow that was the passwd file.\n\n350\n00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:34.520\nWhat about shadow?\n\n351\n00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:35.170\nRight?\n\n352\n00:18:35.170 --> 00:18:40.000\nIf I take a look at shadow,\nI'm in there, but notice my password.\n\n353\n00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.460\nExclamation point, exclamation point.\n\n354\n00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:47.870\nYou might have noticed that a minute\nago when, like if I don't grep that,\n\n355\n00:18:47.870 --> 00:18:50.230\nwhen I pull up the full shadow file.\n\n356\n00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:54.580\nYou'll see a lot of these entries\nin here have either a star for\n\n357\n00:18:54.580 --> 00:18:58.600\na password or exclamation point,\nexclamation point, right?\n\n358\n00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:02.840\nSo what that indicates is that\nthe account is either disabled or\n\n359\n00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:04.570\ndoesn't have a password.\n\n360\n00:19:04.570 --> 00:19:07.950\nI created this account,\nI never assigned a password to it.\n\n361\n00:19:07.950 --> 00:19:10.330\nIt's probably a good idea to do that.\n\n362\n00:19:10.330 --> 00:19:13.630\nSo we don't normally stop\nwith just useradd, all right?\n\n363\n00:19:13.630 --> 00:19:19.000\nUseradd will create the user, but\nwe normally follow that up with passwd and\n\n364\n00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:23.660\nthe user to assign a password to them,\nokay?\n\n365\n00:19:23.660 --> 00:19:28.520\nNow I can punch in a password and I'll\njust do the word password all lower case.\n\n366\n00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:32.240\nIt's warning me about that cuz it's\nthe worst of the dictionary words,\n\n367\n00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:34.280\nmight as well be 1234.\n\n368\n00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:36.580\nBut I've gone ahead and assigned it.\n\n369\n00:19:36.580 --> 00:19:37.970\nNow I should have a password.\n\n370\n00:19:37.970 --> 00:19:40.997\nAnd if I take a look at my shadow file,\n\n371\n00:19:40.997 --> 00:19:45.898\nnow I can see I have a nice,\nbig encrypted hash right there.\n\n372\n00:19:45.898 --> 00:19:48.660\nI'm in the system and\nI've got a password, all right.\n\n373\n00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:50.880\nSo really when we add a user,\nwe wanna do two things.\n\n374\n00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:53.341\nWe wanna use the useradd\ncommand to create them and\n\n375\n00:19:53.341 --> 00:19:55.398\nthen we wanna follow that up with passwd.\n\n376\n00:19:57.338 --> 00:20:01.520\nAll right, now useradd,\nI really did it just super simple.\n\n377\n00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:03.900\nUseradd and a user name, all right?\n\n378\n00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:08.340\nBut there is a lot more that we\ncan do when we go in and run it.\n\n379\n00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:13.700\nSo in the show the other day for example,\n\n380\n00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:18.440\nI did useradd -c Bob smith b smith.\n\n381\n00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:20.300\nOkay, actually I think\nit's a lower case c.\n\n382\n00:20:22.470 --> 00:20:25.670\nYou know the case is important and I can't\nremember if it's a lower case or capital.\n\n383\n00:20:25.670 --> 00:20:28.350\nFor some reason I thought it was capital,\nwe'll see what happens.\n\n384\n00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:31.190\n[LAUGH] If you're smarter than me I\nwould just pull up the man file, but\n\n385\n00:20:31.190 --> 00:20:32.480\nI'll wait and see what happens.\n\n386\n00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:37.500\nSo -C, what that's telling\nme is to do a full name.\n\n387\n00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:40.220\nWhen I created dpezet,\nyeah I created a username of dpezet but\n\n388\n00:20:40.220 --> 00:20:41.680\nit has no full name.\n\n389\n00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:46.300\nThe full name is it might have spaces,\nit has capitalization and it looks nice.\n\n390\n00:20:46.300 --> 00:20:48.740\nApparently there's a lowercase c.\n\n391\n00:20:48.740 --> 00:20:50.390\nLet's pull that up right, yeah.\n\n392\n00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:53.720\nI'm just gonna pull up\nthe documentation we had.\n\n393\n00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:57.510\n-C is a comment and notice it says, it's\ngenerally a short description of login and\n\n394\n00:20:57.510 --> 00:21:01.060\nis currently used as field for\nthe user's full name, right?\n\n395\n00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:02.550\nSo I can store that in there.\n\n396\n00:21:02.550 --> 00:21:06.520\nAnd while I'm in here you can see,\nif I wanna change their home directory.\n\n397\n00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:10.890\nIt doesn't have to go to /home, I can do\n-D and point to their home directory.\n\n398\n00:21:10.890 --> 00:21:15.780\nAnd you'll see a lot of other things that\nare in here -f to make them inactive.\n\n399\n00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:19.130\nWhen you make them -f that means\nthe user account is created, but\n\n400\n00:21:19.130 --> 00:21:20.400\nno one can login as them.\n\n401\n00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:24.190\nAnd that's actually one of the defaults\nif you don't specify a password.\n\n402\n00:21:24.190 --> 00:21:26.068\nSo that one is there.\n\n403\n00:21:26.068 --> 00:21:28.430\nWe've got -g for\n\n404\n00:21:28.430 --> 00:21:30.940\nspecifying the group, I'm gonna talk\nabout that here in a little bit.\n\n405\n00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:32.430\nBecause there's actually a variation.\n\n406\n00:21:32.430 --> 00:21:35.967\nThere's lower case g and capital G,\nthere is a difference, so\n\n407\n00:21:35.967 --> 00:21:37.923\nI'll talk about that in a minute.\n\n408\n00:21:37.923 --> 00:21:40.662\n-K, you can specify\na different skeleton directory,\n\n409\n00:21:40.662 --> 00:21:44.690\nif you wanna use a different template for\ndifferent user's you can.\n\n410\n00:21:44.690 --> 00:21:48.900\nSo tons of cool features, I'm not gonna\nbore us by going through all of these.\n\n411\n00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:53.280\nOne that I wanted to point out was -p cuz\nI used that in the show the other day.\n\n412\n00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:54.980\n-P is the password.\n\n413\n00:21:54.980 --> 00:22:01.340\nNotice how it says the encrypted password\nas returned by the crypt function, okay?\n\n414\n00:22:01.340 --> 00:22:02.370\nIf you use -p and\n\n415\n00:22:02.370 --> 00:22:05.801\nyou provide an unencrypted password,\nit doesn't actually work.\n\n416\n00:22:05.801 --> 00:22:10.395\nBecause it assumes that you've already\nencrypted it and so it won't work.\n\n417\n00:22:10.395 --> 00:22:12.283\nSo I think I used that in\nthe show the other day,\n\n418\n00:22:12.283 --> 00:22:14.039\nI've mentioned them it was unencrypted.\n\n419\n00:22:14.039 --> 00:22:16.017\nI just wanna mention it again,\nso you guys know.\n\n420\n00:22:16.017 --> 00:22:20.593\nThat's only useful if you've\nalready filtered your word through\n\n421\n00:22:20.593 --> 00:22:23.130\nCrypto with the proper seed values.\n\n422\n00:22:23.130 --> 00:22:27.270\nAll right, so those are some examples,\n-s for setting the shell.\n\n423\n00:22:27.270 --> 00:22:31.620\nYou can even do -u and\nspecifically pick a user ID number, right?\n\n424\n00:22:31.620 --> 00:22:33.730\nNow normally we create a user ID or\na user,\n\n425\n00:22:33.730 --> 00:22:35.848\nwe just let it pick\nthe next user ID available.\n\n426\n00:22:35.848 --> 00:22:40.790\nSo I'm 500, Bob Smith would be 501 and\nthen whoever else I create would be 502.\n\n427\n00:22:40.790 --> 00:22:44.740\nWhy would I want to manipulate\nthe user ID number?\n\n428\n00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:49.740\nWell, if you have more than one Linux or\nreally Unix in general,\n\n429\n00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:50.670\nany Unix based server.\n\n430\n00:22:50.670 --> 00:22:54.510\nIf you have more than one of them and\nyou're doing something like NFS.\n\n431\n00:22:54.510 --> 00:22:59.420\nWhen a user account on one system\nacts as network file system share,\n\n432\n00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:01.980\nNFS share on another system.\n\n433\n00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:05.290\nThe user account information is\nhanded across using the UID,\n\n434\n00:23:05.290 --> 00:23:08.220\nthe ID number, not the name.\n\n435\n00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:13.050\nSo if Bob is 502, when he reaches over\nto that other NFS share, he's gonna say,\n\n436\n00:23:13.050 --> 00:23:14.180\nhey, I'm user 502.\n\n437\n00:23:14.180 --> 00:23:19.220\nAnd the other side's gonna say, well 502\nis Jane Johnson, she doesn't have access.\n\n438\n00:23:20.290 --> 00:23:23.220\nIt doesn't know that you're Bob Smith,\nso what we might wanna do is\n\n439\n00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:28.340\nwhen we create a Bob Smith account,\nwe make him user ID 600 on our server.\n\n440\n00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:32.370\nAnd we create the same user account\non the other side also user id 600,\n\n441\n00:23:32.370 --> 00:23:36.240\nand that way when we exchange\nthat user id, they match.\n\n442\n00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:38.360\nYou do need to that sometimes,\n\n443\n00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:41.450\nNFS is the only example where\nI've actually had to do it.\n\n444\n00:23:41.450 --> 00:23:45.518\nBut there's other time I'm sure\nwhere you have similar names,\n\n445\n00:23:45.518 --> 00:23:50.217\nyou can get around that with open LDAP and\nother directory technologies.\n\n446\n00:23:50.217 --> 00:23:52.640\nBut matching the UIDs is\nthe one that's built in.\n\n447\n00:23:54.860 --> 00:23:58.862\nAll right, so if I wanna create\nBob Smith and I want to give him a name.\n\n448\n00:23:58.862 --> 00:24:04.020\nI can do -c and that will now\npopulate him with a full name,\n\n449\n00:24:04.020 --> 00:24:07.187\nnot just his individual username.\n\n450\n00:24:07.187 --> 00:24:12.537\nAll right So, now he's created, but\nagain he doesn't have a password,\n\n451\n00:24:12.537 --> 00:24:15.642\nso I just need to attach\na password to him and\n\n452\n00:24:15.642 --> 00:24:20.502\nI can say passwd bsmith and\nthen I can punch in the password for him.\n\n453\n00:24:20.502 --> 00:24:27.635\nAll right, and\nnow if I take a look at the old shadow.\n\n454\n00:24:31.489 --> 00:24:32.535\nRight.\n\n455\n00:24:32.535 --> 00:24:34.615\nWe can look through here, and\nwe see our various users, and\n\n456\n00:24:34.615 --> 00:24:38.595\ndown at the bottom there's me,\ndpezet, and there's Bob Smith.\n\n457\n00:24:38.595 --> 00:24:42.725\nAnd if you look at the password,\nlook how Bob and I have the same password.\n\n458\n00:24:42.725 --> 00:24:44.745\nI did lowercase password both times.\n\n459\n00:24:44.745 --> 00:24:49.780\nBut we actually have different hashes,\nit's not an identical match\n\n460\n00:24:49.780 --> 00:24:54.470\nbetween the two and that's because it\nis a one way hash that's being done.\n\n461\n00:24:54.470 --> 00:24:58.280\nSo it's kind of neat, it helps\nprevent against collision attacks and\n\n462\n00:24:58.280 --> 00:24:59.321\nthings like that.\n\n463\n00:24:59.321 --> 00:25:03.310\nAll right and\nif I take a look at /etc/passwd,\n\n464\n00:25:03.310 --> 00:25:07.820\ndown there towards the end,\nI'll see munbob.\n\n465\n00:25:07.820 --> 00:25:14.260\nAnd I can see Bob has a name, Bob Smith,\nversus me, where mine is blank.\n\n466\n00:25:14.260 --> 00:25:18.475\nI didn't put in a full name for myself, I\njust hit colon colon, but his, Bob Smith,\n\n467\n00:25:18.475 --> 00:25:19.685\nall right?\n\n468\n00:25:19.685 --> 00:25:21.970\nSo those kind of values are useful.\n\n469\n00:25:21.970 --> 00:25:24.375\nNow we have a little bit more\ninformation about that user.\n\n470\n00:25:26.945 --> 00:25:30.975\nAll right now user add,\nthat's for adding users.\n\n471\n00:25:30.975 --> 00:25:34.065\nWhat if I want to give myself a full name?\n\n472\n00:25:34.065 --> 00:25:37.278\nSo I want to add a full name to my user,\nokay?\n\n473\n00:25:37.278 --> 00:25:45.500\nWell I could do user add -c\n\"Don Pezet\" dpezet right.\n\n474\n00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:49.480\nBut what it's gonna do is it's gonna try\nto create a new user because user add\n\n475\n00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:50.620\nadds users right.\n\n476\n00:25:50.620 --> 00:25:52.850\nSo that's not really going to\nbe all that effective for me.\n\n477\n00:25:52.850 --> 00:25:56.150\nSo what I need to do is use usermod.\n\n478\n00:25:56.150 --> 00:26:00.010\nUsermod lets us modify\na user that already exists.\n\n479\n00:26:00.010 --> 00:26:04.060\nAnd so I can use usermod to go in and\nchange any of those values.\n\n480\n00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:07.040\nYou can pretty much change anything.\n\n481\n00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:09.270\nThe user name is really the only\nthing you can't change.\n\n482\n00:26:09.270 --> 00:26:12.990\nAnd so you look through there you can\nsee all different you can change the uid\n\n483\n00:26:12.990 --> 00:26:13.670\nif you want.\n\n484\n00:26:13.670 --> 00:26:16.850\nChange it after the fact,\nyou can do all sorts of stuff.\n\n485\n00:26:16.850 --> 00:26:21.120\nSo if I want to add a full\nname to my account,\n\n486\n00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:24.790\nDon Pezer apparently I\ncan't spell my own name.\n\n487\n00:26:24.790 --> 00:26:26.790\nWe can just, I did it twice,\n\n488\n00:26:26.790 --> 00:26:31.410\nthat's amazing,\nafter almost 40 years of spelling my name.\n\n489\n00:26:31.410 --> 00:26:37.050\nAnyhow so there we go so I'm just writing\nout Don Pezet, and so that's gonna modify\n\n490\n00:26:37.050 --> 00:26:41.980\nmy account and add that value to it and\nusermod is a great way to change things.\n\n491\n00:26:41.980 --> 00:26:45.100\nAnything like this would be a typo or\nwhatever we can modify.\n\n492\n00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:47.530\nLiterally the username is the only\nthing we can't change with it.\n\n493\n00:26:49.550 --> 00:26:51.840\n>> So you can change your user ID.\n\n494\n00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:55.530\nYou can change the user's full name,\nbut not the actual username itself.\n\n495\n00:26:55.530 --> 00:26:58.861\n>> Yeah, if you're gonna change\nthe username itself you might as well just\n\n496\n00:26:58.861 --> 00:27:00.674\ncreate a new user is how they look at it.\n\n497\n00:27:00.674 --> 00:27:05.070\nBut now I can see, I've got a nice neat,\nfull name right in there.\n\n498\n00:27:05.070 --> 00:27:06.172\nJust like Bob Smith, and\n\n499\n00:27:06.172 --> 00:27:09.857\napparently we have the exact same amount\nof letters in our name, which is awesome.\n\n500\n00:27:09.857 --> 00:27:11.422\nIt lines up nice and neat.\n\n501\n00:27:11.422 --> 00:27:13.993\nI like it when things\nare esthetically pleasing.\n\n502\n00:27:13.993 --> 00:27:18.010\nSo anyhow so it lines up and now I can\ncontinue to add more users if I so choose.\n\n503\n00:27:19.090 --> 00:27:22.530\nAll right, and so we got useradd, usermod,\n\n504\n00:27:22.530 --> 00:27:26.150\nand we have userdel,\nuser delete is the other one.\n\n505\n00:27:26.150 --> 00:27:28.700\nSo, I'm tired of Bob, and\nI wanna get rid of him.\n\n506\n00:27:28.700 --> 00:27:30.730\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Now, personally,\n\n507\n00:27:30.730 --> 00:27:33.470\nI never delete user accounts, right?\n\n508\n00:27:33.470 --> 00:27:34.630\nI just deactivate them.\n\n509\n00:27:34.630 --> 00:27:37.575\nYou'll notice in usermod we\nhad the option in there for\n\n510\n00:27:37.575 --> 00:27:40.320\n-f to make them inactive, okay.\n\n511\n00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:44.150\nSet password inactive after\nexpiration to inactive.\n\n512\n00:27:44.150 --> 00:27:50.540\nSo, we can basically deactivate a user and\nshut them off.\n\n513\n00:27:50.540 --> 00:27:54.340\nNow I like to do that\nbecause you just never know\n\n514\n00:27:54.340 --> 00:27:56.180\nwhen you might need that user again.\n\n515\n00:27:56.180 --> 00:27:57.760\nYou can also lock the user account.\n\n516\n00:27:57.760 --> 00:28:00.480\nSo inactive is nice because\nyou can schedule it.\n\n517\n00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:03.710\nYou basically set it to make them\ninactive after a certain amount of days.\n\n518\n00:28:03.710 --> 00:28:05.940\nBut if you want to shut them off\nright now, you can lock them.\n\n519\n00:28:05.940 --> 00:28:09.670\nSo what I do is if we're terminating\nan employee, if somebody's leaving or\n\n520\n00:28:09.670 --> 00:28:12.840\nwhatever, I'll usually just inactivate or\nlock their account.\n\n521\n00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:15.990\nAnd when you do that,\nnow that account can't log in anymore but\n\n522\n00:28:15.990 --> 00:28:17.220\nit's still sitting there.\n\n523\n00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:20.485\nAnd if I ever come across something\ndown the road where I'm like man,\n\n524\n00:28:20.485 --> 00:28:22.930\nthis is secured with their permissions.\n\n525\n00:28:22.930 --> 00:28:25.710\nI don't want to override those permissions\ncuz I might mess something up.\n\n526\n00:28:25.710 --> 00:28:28.480\nI wish I could just log in as them,\nwell I can, I can go back and\n\n527\n00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:29.930\nI can unlock their account.\n\n528\n00:28:29.930 --> 00:28:33.420\nI can change their password with\npasswd to something that I know and\n\n529\n00:28:33.420 --> 00:28:34.880\nnow I can log in as that user.\n\n530\n00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:37.790\nSo it's kind of valuable to have\nthose user accounts laying around.\n\n531\n00:28:37.790 --> 00:28:41.910\nSo if I'm gonna get rid of somebody,\nwhat I'll do normally,\n\n532\n00:28:41.910 --> 00:28:44.820\nis say usermod -L, capital L.\n\n533\n00:28:44.820 --> 00:28:49.700\nAnd I'll specify that for\nbsmith so, you know what Ronnie,\n\n534\n00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:52.490\njust kinda look at it here,\nI might have lied.\n\n535\n00:28:52.490 --> 00:28:55.260\nThere's -l for\nchanging the value of the login name.\n\n536\n00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:58.630\nYou actually can change the log in name,\nI did not know that.\n\n537\n00:28:58.630 --> 00:29:01.520\nSee, you read some of the documentation\nyou learn something once in a while.\n\n538\n00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:04.040\nI thought username was\nsomething you couldn't change.\n\n539\n00:29:04.040 --> 00:29:04.713\nInteresting.\n\n540\n00:29:04.713 --> 00:29:06.115\n>> Yeah I would not have known that.\n\n541\n00:29:06.115 --> 00:29:07.490\n>> You learn something new everyday.\n\n542\n00:29:07.490 --> 00:29:10.400\nAll right, so\nnow I've disabled Bob's account.\n\n543\n00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:14.470\nAnd so it's still there, it still exists,\nbut he can't log in, he's locked.\n\n544\n00:29:14.470 --> 00:29:17.090\nSo I don't have to worry\nabout him logging in and\n\n545\n00:29:17.090 --> 00:29:20.000\nif I ever need his account\nI can get it back again.\n\n546\n00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:22.890\nBut if I absolutely know I'm never gonna\nneed it again, maybe it was a typo,\n\n547\n00:29:22.890 --> 00:29:24.220\nmaybe I don't want it anymore.\n\n548\n00:29:24.220 --> 00:29:30.600\nThen I can do userdel and I can actually\ndelete Bob Smith and now he'll be gone.\n\n549\n00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:35.420\nI can verify that by looking\nin the passwd folder.\n\n550\n00:29:37.330 --> 00:29:40.190\nAnd I'll just filter that for\nBob Smith and\n\n551\n00:29:40.190 --> 00:29:43.435\nhe doesn't turn up, so\nhe's gone, he's been deleted.\n\n552\n00:29:43.435 --> 00:29:46.360\nHis user ID is now available for reuse.\n\n553\n00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:49.090\n>> Now Don, is there a place where we\ncan actually see when it's locked out\n\n554\n00:29:49.090 --> 00:29:50.070\ninstead or?\n\n555\n00:29:50.070 --> 00:29:51.880\n>> Yeah,\nwhen somebody is locked out, right?\n\n556\n00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:56.180\nSo if I put, actually I'm not logged\nin as myself, I can just do mine.\n\n557\n00:29:56.180 --> 00:30:02.170\nSo I'm gonna lock out L dpezer,\nI'm in that mode today.\n\n558\n00:30:02.170 --> 00:30:09.190\nIf we go in and take a look at our passwd\nright, and we find the account in there.\n\n559\n00:30:09.190 --> 00:30:11.940\nWe don't really see anything that\nindicates that it's locked out.\n\n560\n00:30:11.940 --> 00:30:16.740\nBut, if we look in shadow,\nit should be in here,\n\n561\n00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:22.240\nand it is, there it is.\n\n562\n00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:26.541\nSo if we look, it's off my screen,\nlet me get this back up here.\n\n563\n00:30:26.541 --> 00:30:28.680\nAll right, so\ntake a look at root, up here.\n\n564\n00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:32.880\nSee how root starts with $6$, and\nlets me know that's a password?\n\n565\n00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:34.730\nBut take a look at my account.\n\n566\n00:30:34.730 --> 00:30:35.850\nSee how my account now starts with !$6$,\n\n567\n00:30:35.850 --> 00:30:41.010\nthat exclamation point right there\nis what lets me know it's locked.\n\n568\n00:30:41.010 --> 00:30:44.820\nSo I'm locked out, and so\nI can't log in with this password.\n\n569\n00:30:44.820 --> 00:30:48.125\nSo even if I put in that valid password,\nthat full match?\n\n570\n00:30:48.125 --> 00:30:50.180\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> The exclamation point says no,\n\n571\n00:30:50.180 --> 00:30:51.990\nwe're not gonna let you in, you're locked.\n\n572\n00:30:51.990 --> 00:30:52.490\n>> Okay.\n\n573\n00:30:52.490 --> 00:30:53.910\n>> So that's where we can see it.\n\n574\n00:30:53.910 --> 00:31:00.810\nAnd if you look at usermod, so I use\n-L to lock it, you use -U to unlock it.\n\n575\n00:31:00.810 --> 00:31:05.590\nSo I can just do -U dpezet.\n\n576\n00:31:05.590 --> 00:31:12.050\nAnd now if I go back into here,\nand pull up my account, that's it.\n\n577\n00:31:12.050 --> 00:31:14.770\nI'm gonna switch these keys\naround on my keyboard.\n\n578\n00:31:14.770 --> 00:31:16.800\nThere, now you can see that\nexclamation point is gone.\n\n579\n00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:17.880\n>> Excellent, yeah.\n\n580\n00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:18.870\n>> So, that's how we do it.\n\n581\n00:31:18.870 --> 00:31:20.000\n>> Good.\n\n582\n00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:20.820\n>> All right.\n\n583\n00:31:20.820 --> 00:31:24.320\nSo that's kind of adding\nadditional user accounts and\n\n584\n00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:26.620\nsome of the different\noptions that we have there.\n\n585\n00:31:26.620 --> 00:31:29.580\nGroups are a big part of this also but\nlooking at the clock,\n\n586\n00:31:29.580 --> 00:31:30.490\nI'm a little short on time.\n\n587\n00:31:30.490 --> 00:31:34.148\nSo let's do this, let's stop and\ntake a break, and when we get back,\n\n588\n00:31:34.148 --> 00:31:36.013\nwe're gonna take a look at groups.\n\n589\n00:31:36.013 --> 00:31:39.054\nWe're gonna see how to create groups and\nhow to use them and\n\n590\n00:31:39.054 --> 00:31:42.979\nthen what purposes they serve, so\nstay tuned, we'll be back after this.\n\n591\n00:31:42.979 --> 00:31:52.200\n[SOUND]\nAll right welcome back everybody.\n\n592\n00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:54.670\nSo what I want to do now\nis take a look at groups.\n\n593\n00:31:54.670 --> 00:32:00.865\nSo we saw user accounts, right and we\nwhipped some up, we saw /etc/passwd file.\n\n594\n00:32:00.865 --> 00:32:02.135\nLet's take a look at something else.\n\n595\n00:32:02.135 --> 00:32:05.695\nNow groups, there's several that\nare created automatically and\n\n596\n00:32:05.695 --> 00:32:07.005\nthere's some that we create ourselves.\n\n597\n00:32:07.005 --> 00:32:08.393\nAnd they have their own little file too.\n\n598\n00:32:08.393 --> 00:32:11.306\nBut before I jump into that,\nwait, what the heck is a group?\n\n599\n00:32:11.306 --> 00:32:16.045\nGroups are really cool because they allow\nus to Basically connect user accounts by\n\n600\n00:32:16.045 --> 00:32:18.321\nsome kind of common criteria, right?\n\n601\n00:32:18.321 --> 00:32:21.040\nSo maybe I have a marketing department.\n\n602\n00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:24.490\nAnd I have 50 employees in\nthe marketing department and\n\n603\n00:32:24.490 --> 00:32:29.370\nI want all 50 of those employees to able\nto save file in one particular folder.\n\n604\n00:32:29.370 --> 00:32:32.530\nBut I just want them to do it,\nI don't want to sales people to do it or\n\n605\n00:32:32.530 --> 00:32:34.780\nthe accounting people, just marketing.\n\n606\n00:32:34.780 --> 00:32:35.550\nRight?\n>> Yeah.\n\n607\n00:32:35.550 --> 00:32:38.700\n>> Well with just user accounts\nyou can't really do that.\n\n608\n00:32:38.700 --> 00:32:42.130\nWhen you create a file,\nit has a user attached to it as an owner.\n\n609\n00:32:42.130 --> 00:32:45.200\nI can't make 50 people own one file,\ncan I?\n\n610\n00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:47.030\nWell with groups you can.\n\n611\n00:32:47.030 --> 00:32:50.000\nWith the groups,\nyou can create a group called marketing.\n\n612\n00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:54.460\nYou can put all 50 people in that group\nand now when you assign permissions on\n\n613\n00:32:54.460 --> 00:32:57.940\nthe file you can assign permissions\nto the marketing group and\n\n614\n00:32:57.940 --> 00:33:00.750\nnow they get access as\nopposed to other people.\n\n615\n00:33:00.750 --> 00:33:02.870\nRight?\nSo groups are very powerful.\n\n616\n00:33:02.870 --> 00:33:05.670\nYou can also take users and\nmove them into a group and\n\n617\n00:33:05.670 --> 00:33:08.940\ntake them out of a group thus\nmodifying their permissions.\n\n618\n00:33:08.940 --> 00:33:11.100\nSo groups are a really, really useful.\n\n619\n00:33:11.100 --> 00:33:11.820\nRight?\n\n620\n00:33:11.820 --> 00:33:16.650\nNow user accounts are defined\nin slash etc slash passwd, but\n\n621\n00:33:16.650 --> 00:33:21.490\ngroups are defined in slash etc\nslash groups, or I'm sorry, group.\n\n622\n00:33:21.490 --> 00:33:23.060\nI don't think there's an s on it.\n\n623\n00:33:23.060 --> 00:33:26.570\nLet me make sure real quick, yeah, no s.\n\n624\n00:33:26.570 --> 00:33:29.150\nSo just slash etc slash group.\n\n625\n00:33:29.150 --> 00:33:31.690\nAnd when you look,\nit's very similar to the users.\n\n626\n00:33:31.690 --> 00:33:36.950\nRight, because really groups are a type\nof user, they just contain other people.\n\n627\n00:33:36.950 --> 00:33:40.030\nSo what we're gonna see here\nis a really simple list.\n\n628\n00:33:40.030 --> 00:33:46.540\nYou're gonna see a list that has the group\nname followed by the group's password.\n\n629\n00:33:46.540 --> 00:33:48.710\nNow groups don't typically have passwords,\n\n630\n00:33:48.710 --> 00:33:52.530\nbut you'll find these guys in the passwd\nfile, I mean sorry, not passwd.\n\n631\n00:33:52.530 --> 00:33:57.770\nYou'll find them in the shadow file, and\nso they'll have double exclamation points,\n\n632\n00:33:57.770 --> 00:34:00.250\nwich means they don't have a password and\nthey're locked out.\n\n633\n00:34:00.250 --> 00:34:02.780\nSo you can't log in as that group.\n\n634\n00:34:02.780 --> 00:34:05.630\nSo that's kind of just\na legacy field there and\n\n635\n00:34:05.630 --> 00:34:08.750\nthen it's followed by the ID number for\nthe group.\n\n636\n00:34:08.750 --> 00:34:11.530\nAnd you'll just see it starts at zero and\nit goes up.\n\n637\n00:34:11.530 --> 00:34:15.680\nThere are some generic ones\nlike nobody and users and so\n\n638\n00:34:15.680 --> 00:34:17.870\nthose kind of jump up\na little higher 99 and 100.\n\n639\n00:34:17.870 --> 00:34:23.130\nAnd then after that,\nyou will see a list of who's in the group.\n\n640\n00:34:23.130 --> 00:34:23.800\nOkay?\n\n641\n00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:28.670\nSo notice the bin group,\nthere is a bin user and there is a demon\n\n642\n00:34:28.670 --> 00:34:32.600\nuser who is also in the bin group and so\nyou will see that as you down the line.\n\n643\n00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:35.930\nWhere you'll see multiple\npeople in one group.\n\n644\n00:34:35.930 --> 00:34:38.770\nSo that's kind of like the group\nmembership right there.\n\n645\n00:34:38.770 --> 00:34:43.020\nSo this file, this /etc/group,\nit's a pretty important one.\n\n646\n00:34:44.670 --> 00:34:47.240\nAll right, so\nif I want to work with groups.\n\n647\n00:34:47.240 --> 00:34:50.320\nWell we already sort of\nwork with groups in a way.\n\n648\n00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:52.010\nWhen you create a user account,\n\n649\n00:34:52.010 --> 00:34:56.990\nthat user account basically gets\na group that is their own name, and so\n\n650\n00:34:56.990 --> 00:35:00.280\nby looking at the end of the group file,\ntheir deep as that group.\n\n651\n00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:01.500\nRight?\n\n652\n00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:05.960\nGroup ID 500 which matches my user ID,\nand we deleted old Bob Smith.\n\n653\n00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:07.940\nBut if I put Bob back in.\n\n654\n00:35:07.940 --> 00:35:13.480\nSo I'm just going to recreate Bob Smith,\nand\n\n655\n00:35:13.480 --> 00:35:18.700\nthe mail box still exist from before but\nI'm fine with that and\n\n656\n00:35:18.700 --> 00:35:22.110\nI'll set his password.\n\n657\n00:35:24.190 --> 00:35:24.880\nAll right.\n\n658\n00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:28.685\nSo now if I do\n\n659\n00:35:28.685 --> 00:35:35.510\nmore/etc/group I can see in there,\nbsmith, he's got a group too.\n\n660\n00:35:35.510 --> 00:35:36.990\nRight?\nA group that matches his name.\n\n661\n00:35:36.990 --> 00:35:38.620\nNow the groups that match your name.\n\n662\n00:35:38.620 --> 00:35:41.990\nThey're really just place holders and\nthey're flagged as your primary group.\n\n663\n00:35:41.990 --> 00:35:44.850\nThat's the group that you are in first and\nforemost.\n\n664\n00:35:44.850 --> 00:35:47.070\nBut then you can be in\nsecondary groups and\n\n665\n00:35:47.070 --> 00:35:49.770\nthat's usually where we get\na lot of our permissions from.\n\n666\n00:35:49.770 --> 00:35:50.480\nAll right.\n\n667\n00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:54.590\nSo when we want to put a user\ninto a group we can use\n\n668\n00:35:54.590 --> 00:35:56.690\na couple of different commands for that.\n\n669\n00:35:56.690 --> 00:35:57.820\nBut before I get into\nthe commands to that,\n\n670\n00:35:57.820 --> 00:36:00.200\nwe probably need to create some groups,\nright?\n\n671\n00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:03.050\nSo, I mentioned like a marketing group,\na sales group,\n\n672\n00:36:03.050 --> 00:36:04.750\nwe probably need to create some of those.\n\n673\n00:36:04.750 --> 00:36:09.380\nWell, the cool part here is, it's just\nlike users where we have useradd, usermod,\n\n674\n00:36:09.380 --> 00:36:12.060\nuserdel or userdel.\n\n675\n00:36:12.060 --> 00:36:15.640\nWe've also got groupadd,\ngroupmod, groupdelete so\n\n676\n00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:18.030\nthe commands aren't very different at all.\n\n677\n00:36:18.030 --> 00:36:22.270\nIf I want to come in and\ncreate a new group I can say groupadd and\n\n678\n00:36:22.270 --> 00:36:25.265\nthen I just need to specify\na few basic settings.\n\n679\n00:36:25.265 --> 00:36:27.325\nI don't even have to specify\nthese if I don't want to.\n\n680\n00:36:27.325 --> 00:36:30.255\nSee how there's use this\nencrypted password for the group.\n\n681\n00:36:30.255 --> 00:36:31.895\nWe can set a password to it.\n\n682\n00:36:31.895 --> 00:36:35.975\nWe can make it a system group if we want,\ncreate a system account for it, but for\n\n683\n00:36:35.975 --> 00:36:39.590\nthe most part we're just going to say\ngroupadd and then give it a name.\n\n684\n00:36:39.590 --> 00:36:44.760\nSo I'm going to create a group called\nmarketing, and I'll create a group called\n\n685\n00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:50.982\nsales, and\nyou know maybe a groupadd accounting.\n\n686\n00:36:53.834 --> 00:36:56.660\nAnd maybe I'll create\na sysadmins group also.\n\n687\n00:36:56.660 --> 00:36:58.650\nSo sys admins, those are gonna\nbe people who are, you know,\n\n688\n00:36:58.650 --> 00:37:00.170\nnetwork administrators or whatever.\n\n689\n00:37:00.170 --> 00:37:04.300\nSo I can start to create groups\nbased on job roles or geography or\n\n690\n00:37:04.300 --> 00:37:05.410\nwhatever it is that I want.\n\n691\n00:37:06.490 --> 00:37:08.860\nAnd I can put them in place, okay?\n\n692\n00:37:08.860 --> 00:37:14.280\nSo once I've got the groups in place, now\nI just need to put some people in them.\n\n693\n00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:18.290\nWell we do that on a user by user basis\nand we use the usermod command to do it.\n\n694\n00:37:18.290 --> 00:37:23.280\nNow we have to be carefull with usermod,\nwhen you use usermod to\n\n695\n00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:30.405\nadd a user to a group,\nthere's a -g and and a -G and a-A.\n\n696\n00:37:30.405 --> 00:37:37.135\nAll three of these come into play -g,\nthat's to set their primary group.\n\n697\n00:37:37.135 --> 00:37:40.165\nYou can only have one primary group.\n\n698\n00:37:40.165 --> 00:37:42.835\nSo -g is always a replace.\n\n699\n00:37:42.835 --> 00:37:45.830\nIt's always gonna replace\nwhatever they currently have.\n\n700\n00:37:45.830 --> 00:37:49.710\nMy primary group right now for\ndpezet is dpezet.\n\n701\n00:37:49.710 --> 00:37:55.280\nIf say user mod/gmarketing dpezet and\nit's a lowercase\n\n702\n00:37:55.280 --> 00:38:00.350\nG it will replace my primary group and\nmarketing will become my primary group.\n\n703\n00:38:00.350 --> 00:38:01.990\nI may or may not want that.\n\n704\n00:38:01.990 --> 00:38:05.200\nI may want to leave dpezet\nas my primary group so\n\n705\n00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:08.260\nthat when I create folders,\nthe folders, or\n\n706\n00:38:08.260 --> 00:38:12.140\nwhen I create files, they'll show\nas being owned by dpezet dpezet.\n\n707\n00:38:12.140 --> 00:38:12.780\nRight?\n\n708\n00:38:12.780 --> 00:38:15.160\nBut if I change my primary\ngroup to marketing,\n\n709\n00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:20.120\nwhen I create a file, the file permissions\nwill show as dpezet marketing.\n\n710\n00:38:20.120 --> 00:38:23.310\nRight, that's the main thing that\ncomes with the primary group.\n\n711\n00:38:23.310 --> 00:38:27.330\nThe primary group is going to affect the\ndefault permissions assigned to files and\n\n712\n00:38:27.330 --> 00:38:28.560\nfolders that you create.\n\n713\n00:38:29.710 --> 00:38:32.620\nIf I want to keep it simple,\nwhere when people create files and\n\n714\n00:38:32.620 --> 00:38:37.220\nfolders that is just tied to them, I leave\ntheir primary group as their username and\n\n715\n00:38:37.220 --> 00:38:38.990\nthat way they can choose.\n\n716\n00:38:38.990 --> 00:38:43.900\nIf they want to make those files available\nto other people they can, it's up to them.\n\n717\n00:38:45.330 --> 00:38:48.855\nOtherwise I'm gonna use -G.\n\n718\n00:38:48.855 --> 00:38:52.600\n-G creates supplementary groups,\n\n719\n00:38:52.600 --> 00:38:54.880\nthose secondary groups that\nwe're a member of also.\n\n720\n00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:57.630\nNot our primary, but\nadditional ones, okay.\n\n721\n00:38:57.630 --> 00:38:59.810\nBut, notice the little help text,\nit's easy to overlook this,\n\n722\n00:38:59.810 --> 00:39:03.700\nit says,\na new list of supplementary groups.\n\n723\n00:39:03.700 --> 00:39:07.170\nThat means it's gonna blow away whatever\ngroups we remember of right now.\n\n724\n00:39:07.170 --> 00:39:10.090\nIt's gonna wipe them out except for\nthe primary right.\n\n725\n00:39:10.090 --> 00:39:13.700\nKeep the primary and it's gonna replace\nthem with whatever list I gave now.\n\n726\n00:39:13.700 --> 00:39:18.750\nSo, if I'm in a marketing group and I\nwanna give somebody the sales group also.\n\n727\n00:39:18.750 --> 00:39:25.160\nIf I do a /Gsales, that's gonna wipe out\nthe fact that they were in marketing and\n\n728\n00:39:25.160 --> 00:39:28.270\nreplace it with sales and\nthat's not usually what we want.\n\n729\n00:39:28.270 --> 00:39:31.308\nIf we want to add,\nwe need to make sure we also do /a.\n\n730\n00:39:31.308 --> 00:39:33.520\n/a says append.\n\n731\n00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:40.070\nIf somebody's already in sales and I use\n/a, It will add this new group to them.\n\n732\n00:39:40.070 --> 00:39:42.230\nSo let me show you how that works.\n\n733\n00:39:42.230 --> 00:39:47.152\nSo I'm gonna do\n\n734\n00:39:47.152 --> 00:39:53.211\na user mod-Gsales\n\n735\n00:39:53.211 --> 00:39:58.180\ndpezet okay.\n\n736\n00:39:58.180 --> 00:40:00.610\nSo, what I'm doing is I'm\nsaying modified deficit.\n\n737\n00:40:00.610 --> 00:40:03.280\nI know the username\n[INAUDIBLE] it just the syntax.\n\n738\n00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:08.050\nAnd I'm going to add the supplementary\ngroup to them of sales.\n\n739\n00:40:08.050 --> 00:40:10.480\nSo, I'm adding the sales\ndepartment to my account.\n\n740\n00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:11.750\nAll right.\n\n741\n00:40:11.750 --> 00:40:12.970\nHow do I know that it worked?\n\n742\n00:40:12.970 --> 00:40:16.731\nWell, I can look at the group file.\n\n743\n00:40:16.731 --> 00:40:20.505\nSo, I'm gonna take a look\nat /etc/group And,\n\n744\n00:40:20.505 --> 00:40:23.921\nI'll just grep that for sales, all right?\n\n745\n00:40:23.921 --> 00:40:26.110\nAnd, there I can see the sales group.\n\n746\n00:40:26.110 --> 00:40:30.500\nSales group is id 503 and\ndpezet is in that group.\n\n747\n00:40:30.500 --> 00:40:34.040\nSo, I can tell that I'm in the group,\nokay?\n\n748\n00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:40.511\nThen, if I do a usermod-G marketing.\n\n749\n00:40:42.694 --> 00:40:44.740\nAnd if I spell it right, there.\n\n750\n00:40:44.740 --> 00:40:47.120\nBecause I'm doing the dash capital G,\n\n751\n00:40:47.120 --> 00:40:51.830\nit's going to replace the existing\nlist with this new list.\n\n752\n00:40:51.830 --> 00:40:53.030\nAnd this new list is just marketing.\n\n753\n00:40:53.030 --> 00:40:55.630\nI could do commas here and\ndo more than one group.\n\n754\n00:40:55.630 --> 00:40:58.450\nSo when I do that, if I go in there and\n\n755\n00:40:58.450 --> 00:41:02.640\nI take a look at the sales group,\nI'm no longer in the sales group.\n\n756\n00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:06.490\nAnd, if I look at the marketing group,\nI am in the marketing.\n\n757\n00:41:06.490 --> 00:41:10.790\nSo, capital G does a replace by default,\nall right?\n\n758\n00:41:10.790 --> 00:41:14.940\nSo, if we want to be in both groups,\nmarketing and sales.\n\n759\n00:41:14.940 --> 00:41:19.178\nWhat I would really need to do is a -a -G,\n\n760\n00:41:19.178 --> 00:41:22.780\nand that says don't replace\nwhat's already there.\n\n761\n00:41:22.780 --> 00:41:25.522\nJust append, add to it.\n\n762\n00:41:25.522 --> 00:41:28.660\nI wanna add the sales group\nin addition to marketing.\n\n763\n00:41:28.660 --> 00:41:31.510\nAnd now my dpezet account is in both.\n\n764\n00:41:31.510 --> 00:41:34.789\nI'm in marketing and in sales, all right?\n\n765\n00:41:34.789 --> 00:41:39.011\nAnd so\nif we take a look at the groups file,\n\n766\n00:41:39.011 --> 00:41:44.696\n/etc/group and I'll grep that for\ndpezet or dpezer.\n\n767\n00:41:44.696 --> 00:41:45.880\nThere we go.\n\n768\n00:41:45.880 --> 00:41:49.206\nI can see, I still have my own\ngroup although I'm not in it.\n\n769\n00:41:49.206 --> 00:41:54.231\nAnd then I can see marketing and sales and\ndpezet, I'm in both of those, okay?\n\n770\n00:41:54.231 --> 00:41:57.310\nSo I'm now in marketing and sales.\n\n771\n00:41:57.310 --> 00:42:00.050\nAnd I can go through and add other users.\n\n772\n00:42:00.050 --> 00:42:03.180\nI can add sales to the bsmith account.\n\n773\n00:42:03.180 --> 00:42:06.610\nI want Bob to be in sales, all right?\n\n774\n00:42:07.690 --> 00:42:12.510\nAnd so now when I take a look at that\nsame data, I can see the sales group with\n\n775\n00:42:12.510 --> 00:42:18.720\nthe user id of 503, dpezet,bsmith,\nboth of us are in that group.\n\n776\n00:42:18.720 --> 00:42:23.080\nSo now if I give access to a file\nto the sales group, Bob and\n\n777\n00:42:23.080 --> 00:42:25.330\nI will both have that access.\n\n778\n00:42:25.330 --> 00:42:28.260\nThat's the real power of groups,\n\n779\n00:42:28.260 --> 00:42:31.590\nright, being able to give permissions\nto multiple people at once.\n\n780\n00:42:31.590 --> 00:42:34.340\nThat's really the big\nreason we even use groups.\n\n781\n00:42:35.940 --> 00:42:40.984\nAll right, so just word to the wise,\nin your notes, remember that usermod\n\n782\n00:42:40.984 --> 00:42:45.629\n-G is how we add secondary groups,\nbut it is a replace by default, so\n\n783\n00:42:45.629 --> 00:42:50.864\ndon't forget to do the -a if you're\njust trying to add to somebody's list.\n\n784\n00:42:50.864 --> 00:42:53.829\nThere's nothing worse than accidentally\nwiping out somebody's groups,\n\n785\n00:42:53.829 --> 00:42:55.922\ncuz then you gotta remember\nwhat groups they were in.\n\n786\n00:42:55.922 --> 00:42:57.422\nAnd you probably don't remember so\n\n787\n00:42:57.422 --> 00:43:00.130\nyou've gotta go to a backup to\nremember what group they were in.\n\n788\n00:43:01.260 --> 00:43:02.820\nOr hope you've got a snapshot or\nsomething.\n\n789\n00:43:04.470 --> 00:43:06.400\nAll right, so\nthose are some groups right there.\n\n790\n00:43:06.400 --> 00:43:10.940\nA few other things to be aware\nof as we mess with this stuff.\n\n791\n00:43:10.940 --> 00:43:14.510\nThat was a groupadd is what I was using.\n\n792\n00:43:14.510 --> 00:43:16.340\nWe also have groupmod.\n\n793\n00:43:16.340 --> 00:43:20.500\nSo that we can change the groups,\nchange their IDs, their names and stuff.\n\n794\n00:43:20.500 --> 00:43:22.980\nAnd we've got groupdelete,\n\n795\n00:43:22.980 --> 00:43:26.760\nwhich will let us wipe out a group\nif we don't need it anymore, okay?\n\n796\n00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:30.180\nAnd once those are created,\nthen we can start to do things.\n\n797\n00:43:30.180 --> 00:43:35.178\nWe can create a directory here in,\nmaybe I'll make one\n\n798\n00:43:35.178 --> 00:43:40.380\nin var which I'll just call marketing,\nall right?\n\n799\n00:43:40.380 --> 00:43:45.974\nAnd so, I just made a folder called\nmarketing, /var/marketing, and, I might\n\n800\n00:43:45.974 --> 00:43:51.618\nchange it's permissions cuz the default\nfor that, if I come in here and look.\n\n801\n00:43:51.618 --> 00:43:56.462\nSee how marketing, I made it, so\nI'm the user attached to it and\n\n802\n00:43:56.462 --> 00:43:58.993\nroot is the group attached to it?\n\n803\n00:43:58.993 --> 00:44:02.146\nSo if I want to allow the marketing\npeople to work with that,\n\n804\n00:44:02.146 --> 00:44:04.809\nI need to change the group\nthat's attached to it.\n\n805\n00:44:04.809 --> 00:44:07.075\nAnd I can use chgrp, change group and\n\n806\n00:44:07.075 --> 00:44:10.660\nthat would let me change\nthe group of this folder.\n\n807\n00:44:10.660 --> 00:44:13.034\nBut I normally use chown, change owner.\n\n808\n00:44:13.034 --> 00:44:16.820\nCuz you can specify the owner and\nthe group at the same time.\n\n809\n00:44:16.820 --> 00:44:25.806\nI could say chown\nmarketing:marketing ./marketing.\n\n810\n00:44:25.806 --> 00:44:32.690\nOkay, shoot, I didn't create associated\nuser so we'll leave it as root, there.\n\n811\n00:44:32.690 --> 00:44:37.413\nOkay, so now, I'm still the person that\nowns that folder but the folder itself has\n\n812\n00:44:37.413 --> 00:44:41.749\npermissions for group attached to it also,\nthe group is what's assigned.\n\n813\n00:44:41.749 --> 00:44:47.222\nAnd if I do a chmod to\nupdate the permissions,\n\n814\n00:44:47.222 --> 00:44:53.278\nI could do like a 775 but\nwe don't really need.\n\n815\n00:44:53.278 --> 00:44:59.096\nWell, it doesn't matter,\nI'll do 775 ./marketing.\n\n816\n00:44:59.096 --> 00:45:02.718\nAnd now when I take a look at that\nfolder and I find it in here,\n\n817\n00:45:02.718 --> 00:45:07.426\nI'll see that I'm still the owner,\nroot's still the user attached to it and\n\n818\n00:45:07.426 --> 00:45:09.690\nI've got read, write and execute.\n\n819\n00:45:09.690 --> 00:45:17.070\nBut marketing is the group and marketing\nhas read, write and execute also, okay?\n\n820\n00:45:17.070 --> 00:45:19.770\nSo now, any of those users\nin the marketing group can\n\n821\n00:45:19.770 --> 00:45:23.880\nbrowse into this folder, start to create\nfiles, start to do whatever they want.\n\n822\n00:45:23.880 --> 00:45:25.670\nAnd they've got that permission.\n\n823\n00:45:25.670 --> 00:45:26.580\nThey've got the ability to do it.\n\n824\n00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:30.730\nSo groups, really cool,\npretty easy to use.\n\n825\n00:45:30.730 --> 00:45:33.642\nDefinitely a time saver because\nif there's 15 different folders\n\n826\n00:45:33.642 --> 00:45:36.350\nyou're assigning permissions on and\nyou hire a new employee,\n\n827\n00:45:36.350 --> 00:45:39.536\nyou don't wanna have to go and\nset permissions in 15 different places.\n\n828\n00:45:39.536 --> 00:45:42.835\nYou just take that employee, you stick\nthem in the appropriate group and\n\n829\n00:45:42.835 --> 00:45:45.285\nthen they get those\npermissions through the groups.\n\n830\n00:45:45.285 --> 00:45:48.030\nSo, very, very useful thing.\n\n831\n00:45:48.030 --> 00:45:52.540\nThere are more advanced forms of\nthis like SELinux really kinda\n\n832\n00:45:52.540 --> 00:45:54.210\nblows the tops off of this.\n\n833\n00:45:54.210 --> 00:45:58.936\nBut at a base level,\nthis is functionality that's included in\n\n834\n00:45:58.936 --> 00:46:03.927\nevery UNIX variant that's out there,\nBSD, UNIX, Linux, oSX,\n\n835\n00:46:03.927 --> 00:46:08.316\nwhatever, they all follow\nthe same pattern, all right?\n\n836\n00:46:08.316 --> 00:46:11.076\nI feel like I'm leaving something\nout Ronnie, what did I leave out?\n\n837\n00:46:11.076 --> 00:46:12.948\n>> CHSH.\n\n838\n00:46:12.948 --> 00:46:16.985\n>> Yes, all right, and user add.\n\n839\n00:46:16.985 --> 00:46:21.609\nSo, two last little things.\n\n840\n00:46:21.609 --> 00:46:23.907\nCHSH, what Ronnie mentioned.\n\n841\n00:46:23.907 --> 00:46:25.827\nEvery user has a default shell and\n\n842\n00:46:25.827 --> 00:46:28.990\nthat was the other thing that\nwe saw in the passwd file.\n\n843\n00:46:28.990 --> 00:46:32.390\nIf I do a more /etc/passwd.\n\n844\n00:46:32.390 --> 00:46:33.590\nWhen I look at each user,\n\n845\n00:46:33.590 --> 00:46:36.361\nthe last thing in the entry is\nwhat shall they get, right?\n\n846\n00:46:36.361 --> 00:46:40.056\nSo /bin/bash is the default\nhere in CentOS,\n\n847\n00:46:40.056 --> 00:46:44.360\nin your distro it might\nbe something different.\n\n848\n00:46:44.360 --> 00:46:50.364\nIf I wanna change the shell,\nsomebody gets when they log in,\n\n849\n00:46:50.364 --> 00:46:53.796\nI can use the chsh, change shell.\n\n850\n00:46:53.796 --> 00:46:58.347\n[LAUGH] chsh,\nto modify what that shell is going to be.\n\n851\n00:46:58.347 --> 00:47:01.610\nIf you just run it by itself,\nit changes your default shell.\n\n852\n00:47:01.610 --> 00:47:04.970\nSo it's trying to change the shell for\nme as root, right?\n\n853\n00:47:04.970 --> 00:47:09.583\nBut if I wanna change Bob's shell,\nI can run chsh bsmith and\n\n854\n00:47:09.583 --> 00:47:13.006\nnow it's gonna let me modify Bob's shell.\n\n855\n00:47:13.006 --> 00:47:17.621\nAnd so I can go in and\nchange it to whatever I want it to be so\n\n856\n00:47:17.621 --> 00:47:20.588\nI might want his to be /bin/tcsh.\n\n857\n00:47:20.588 --> 00:47:22.420\nAll right,\nwhich I don't know if I have installed.\n\n858\n00:47:22.420 --> 00:47:23.895\nIt's probably a good idea to check and\n\n859\n00:47:23.895 --> 00:47:26.811\nsee if it's installed before you\nassign it as somebody's default shell.\n\n860\n00:47:29.210 --> 00:47:33.080\nLet's just take a look real\nquick in /bin and see.\n\n861\n00:47:33.080 --> 00:47:35.180\nWe do, we have TCSH, all right?\n\n862\n00:47:35.180 --> 00:47:36.910\nIf I didn't,\nI could always install it real quick.\n\n863\n00:47:36.910 --> 00:47:39.860\nBut now Bob has that\ndifferent default shell.\n\n864\n00:47:39.860 --> 00:47:44.680\nAnd if I look at /etc/passwd and\nI find Bob in there.\n\n865\n00:47:44.680 --> 00:47:49.342\nSee how I'm still set for bash, but\nI can see that he's now set for TCSH.\n\n866\n00:47:49.342 --> 00:47:52.438\nSo he's got that alternate shell and so,\n\n867\n00:47:52.438 --> 00:47:57.050\nif I were to jump into one of my ttys and\nlog in as me, all right?\n\n868\n00:47:57.050 --> 00:47:57.770\nHere I am.\n\n869\n00:47:57.770 --> 00:48:00.638\nI'm in a normal bash\nshell that we're used to.\n\n870\n00:48:00.638 --> 00:48:07.606\nAnd if I log in as bsmith, all right,\nhe gets well, tcsh looks exactly the same.\n\n871\n00:48:07.606 --> 00:48:08.169\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n872\n00:48:08.169 --> 00:48:11.361\nI guess it's not the greatest example,\nbut yeah,\n\n873\n00:48:11.361 --> 00:48:15.755\nit actually uses the same config\nfiles too, so that was a bad example.\n\n874\n00:48:15.755 --> 00:48:20.979\nLet me move him to sh or something.\n\n875\n00:48:20.979 --> 00:48:25.280\nSomething we'll actually be able\nto see the difference of sh.\n\n876\n00:48:32.007 --> 00:48:33.130\nThere we go.\n\n877\n00:48:33.130 --> 00:48:35.710\nSo now I can see he's actually\ngetting the standard shell,\n\n878\n00:48:35.710 --> 00:48:39.150\njust the really basic one so\nhe gets in there and now he can work,\n\n879\n00:48:39.150 --> 00:48:43.570\nthat's his default shell And\nhe could always change it if he wanted.\n\n880\n00:48:43.570 --> 00:48:46.490\nSo see how he can change his own shell and\nhe can put it back to,\n\n881\n00:48:46.490 --> 00:48:51.490\nI gotta type a password,\nhe can change it back to /bin/bash if\n\n882\n00:48:51.490 --> 00:48:56.530\nthat's his preference and it won't take\naffect until he logs out and logs back in.\n\n883\n00:48:58.510 --> 00:49:00.620\nAnd now he's back to normal,\nso kind of a cool one.\n\n884\n00:49:00.620 --> 00:49:03.700\n>> Yeah.\n>> All right, and then one other thing,\n\n885\n00:49:03.700 --> 00:49:04.620\nuser add.\n\n886\n00:49:04.620 --> 00:49:08.210\nWhen we ran user add it\ncreates the user account,\n\n887\n00:49:08.210 --> 00:49:10.730\nit specifies the home directory,\nand so on.\n\n888\n00:49:10.730 --> 00:49:17.080\nIts defaults, the default function for\nthat command is actually stored in /etc.\n\n889\n00:49:17.080 --> 00:49:22.610\nInside of size UTC you'll find\na file in there called default and\n\n890\n00:49:22.610 --> 00:49:27.810\nin the default folder you'll see user add,\nall right?\n\n891\n00:49:27.810 --> 00:49:31.890\nUser add, so if I do the full path,\nIt was /etc/default/useradd.\n\n892\n00:49:31.890 --> 00:49:39.240\nAll right, so I'm gonna do\na more/etc/default/useradd and\n\n893\n00:49:39.240 --> 00:49:44.530\nwhen I run that, here's where I can\nstart to see the defaults for my system.\n\n894\n00:49:44.530 --> 00:49:47.020\nAnd so notice it defines\nwhere the home directory is.\n\n895\n00:49:47.020 --> 00:49:49.630\nSo when a user gets a home\ndirectory it's gonna go into /home,\n\n896\n00:49:49.630 --> 00:49:52.250\nif you want it to be somewhere else,\nhere's where you change it.\n\n897\n00:49:52.250 --> 00:49:55.660\nWhether they're going to be\ninactive when they're created.\n\n898\n00:49:55.660 --> 00:49:57.900\nWhat their expiration is going to be,\nif we set that,\n\n899\n00:49:57.900 --> 00:49:59.510\nremember how we're not setting it.\n\n900\n00:49:59.510 --> 00:50:02.820\nWhat their default shell is,\nwhat their skeleton folder is.\n\n901\n00:50:02.820 --> 00:50:05.510\nThese are the things we can define\nright here in the default so\n\n902\n00:50:05.510 --> 00:50:09.090\nthat as we add user accounts we don't have\nto specify them as command line options.\n\n903\n00:50:09.090 --> 00:50:09.700\nRight?\nSo\n\n904\n00:50:09.700 --> 00:50:12.848\nthat's another area where we might want to\nmess with, is to change those defaults.\n\n905\n00:50:12.848 --> 00:50:18.390\nAll right, I think that's pretty much.\n\n906\n00:50:18.390 --> 00:50:23.120\nThe only other note I have on here is\nhow to make a non-interactive user,\n\n907\n00:50:23.120 --> 00:50:27.010\nwhich is just to set their login to be\nslash sbin slash nologin, we saw that at\n\n908\n00:50:27.010 --> 00:50:30.650\nthe beginning of the segment, so\nI think that's about it for user accounts.\n\n909\n00:50:30.650 --> 00:50:34.470\nNow, there's still some more stuff I\nwant to talk about on user accounts but\n\n910\n00:50:34.470 --> 00:50:36.400\nI'm going to save that for\nthe security episode.\n\n911\n00:50:36.400 --> 00:50:39.940\nBecause we've got a lot of stuff there as\nfar as impersonating users and so on so\n\n912\n00:50:39.940 --> 00:50:40.850\nwe'll see that down the road.\n\n913\n00:50:42.690 --> 00:50:47.460\nAll right, the next thing that we're\ngonna tackle is scheduling jobs,\n\n914\n00:50:47.460 --> 00:50:49.600\ngetting things to run at certain times,\nand\n\n915\n00:50:49.600 --> 00:50:52.770\nthis is one of the more important\nthings we do as a system administrator.\n\n916\n00:50:52.770 --> 00:50:56.620\nA regular end user doesn't usually\nschedule jobs, but an admin does.\n\n917\n00:50:56.620 --> 00:50:59.730\nSo we want to take some time and\nlook at that, but looking at the clock,\n\n918\n00:50:59.730 --> 00:51:02.160\nwe're running a little short on time so\nwhy don't we do this.\n\n919\n00:51:02.160 --> 00:51:04.220\nLet's stop here and we'll take a break and\n\n920\n00:51:04.220 --> 00:51:07.850\nwhen we get back,\nwe're gonna jump into scheduling activity.\n\n921\n00:51:07.850 --> 00:51:09.799\nSo stay tuned, we'll be back after this.\n\n922\n00:51:09.799 --> 00:51:17.257\n[MUSIC]\n\n923\n00:51:17.257 --> 00:51:19.310\nAll right, welcome back everybody.\n\n924\n00:51:19.310 --> 00:51:22.640\nI know I've made references\nduring the show about how some,\n\n925\n00:51:22.640 --> 00:51:24.810\nwell I have made references\nwith all sorts of things, but\n\n926\n00:51:24.810 --> 00:51:27.390\nsometimes we wanna perform a task but\nwe don't want to do it right now.\n\n927\n00:51:27.390 --> 00:51:27.910\n>> Right.\n\n928\n00:51:27.910 --> 00:51:30.310\n>> Right,\nwe want to put it off until later.\n\n929\n00:51:30.310 --> 00:51:34.500\nLike I want to reboot my server at one am,\nbut I don't want to be here at one am,\n\n930\n00:51:34.500 --> 00:51:37.230\nI just want the server to\nreboot at one am, right.\n\n931\n00:51:37.230 --> 00:51:41.860\nAnd so for stuff like that we maybe\nfortunate and that the command we\n\n932\n00:51:41.860 --> 00:51:46.020\nneed has functionality for time\nshifting so like the shut down command.\n\n933\n00:51:46.020 --> 00:51:50.250\nYou can actually specify a time\nof that shut down to occur at and\n\n934\n00:51:50.250 --> 00:51:51.070\nyou can let it run.\n\n935\n00:51:51.070 --> 00:51:54.210\nAnd then at 1:00 am\nthe system will shut down.\n\n936\n00:51:54.210 --> 00:51:57.080\nAll right.\nBut what if I want to do something like\n\n937\n00:51:57.080 --> 00:52:01.450\ndeactivating users whose passwords have\nexpired or something of that nature right.\n\n938\n00:52:01.450 --> 00:52:04.600\nWell those commands like user mod it\n\n939\n00:52:04.600 --> 00:52:07.750\ndoesn't have any time shifting\nin the command line for it.\n\n940\n00:52:07.750 --> 00:52:08.980\nIt's just not there.\n\n941\n00:52:08.980 --> 00:52:14.290\nSo, fortunately we've got not just one but\ntwo choices in the unit world\n\n942\n00:52:14.290 --> 00:52:18.450\nthat we can have activities\noccur at certain times.\n\n943\n00:52:18.450 --> 00:52:19.570\nI used constantly myself.\n\n944\n00:52:19.570 --> 00:52:20.780\nI have really two commands.\n\n945\n00:52:20.780 --> 00:52:24.990\nThere's Chron which is chron like time,\nchronological or\n\n946\n00:52:24.990 --> 00:52:29.800\nwhatever Chronos,\nthat's where the Klingons live.\n\n947\n00:52:29.800 --> 00:52:33.730\n[LAUGH] Well we were talking\nabout Star Trek during the break.\n\n948\n00:52:33.730 --> 00:52:34.660\nAnyhow, so Chron,\n\n949\n00:52:34.660 --> 00:52:38.170\nwhich lets us schedule things to occur\nat certain times at certain intervals.\n\n950\n00:52:38.170 --> 00:52:43.255\nYou can say run the first Tuesday of every\nevery month for the next three years.\n\n951\n00:52:43.255 --> 00:52:44.985\nYou know?\nYou can say things like that and\n\n952\n00:52:44.985 --> 00:52:46.305\nCron will take care of that for you.\n\n953\n00:52:46.305 --> 00:52:49.185\nAnd then there's also At.\n\n954\n00:52:49.185 --> 00:52:52.785\nAt just says,\nrun this activity at this time.\n\n955\n00:52:52.785 --> 00:52:55.425\nAt, we normally use for\njust like one-time things.\n\n956\n00:52:55.425 --> 00:52:57.215\nIf I don't want the server to\nreboot tonight at 1 AM and\n\n957\n00:52:57.215 --> 00:53:02.380\nthat's it I can say, at 1 AM shutdown now,\nor shutdown dash r now, right?\n\n958\n00:53:02.380 --> 00:53:05.210\nOr reboot, or\nwhatever command it is I wanna issue.\n\n959\n00:53:05.210 --> 00:53:09.010\nVersus cron,\nit's normally repetitious tasks.\n\n960\n00:53:09.010 --> 00:53:12.440\nEvery day I want you to run\nthis backup script at 3 AM.\n\n961\n00:53:12.440 --> 00:53:15.280\nAnd that way it backs up your databases,\nor whatever it is that you want.\n\n962\n00:53:15.280 --> 00:53:15.910\nOkay.\n\n963\n00:53:15.910 --> 00:53:18.580\nSo cron is useful for repetitious things.\n\n964\n00:53:18.580 --> 00:53:20.890\nAt is really just a one-time thing.\n\n965\n00:53:20.890 --> 00:53:21.840\nAll right.\n\n966\n00:53:21.840 --> 00:53:25.690\nSo let's take a look at these two commands\nand see how we can use them, all right?\n\n967\n00:53:25.690 --> 00:53:29.190\nSo I mentioned, for example,\nthe at command, for one-time things.\n\n968\n00:53:29.190 --> 00:53:34.060\nYou know, I want to create a user account,\nbut I don't want to create them right now.\n\n969\n00:53:34.060 --> 00:53:37.710\nI don't want them in the system now,\nbecause I'm not ready for those users.\n\n970\n00:53:37.710 --> 00:53:41.680\nSo, let me think if I can put\nthis in a real world example.\n\n971\n00:53:41.680 --> 00:53:42.850\nAll right.\n\n972\n00:53:42.850 --> 00:53:45.080\nSo you work for a university, right.\n\n973\n00:53:45.080 --> 00:53:47.920\nWe're based out of Gainesville,\nFlorida and whether you like them or\n\n974\n00:53:47.920 --> 00:53:50.960\nnot the University of Florida\nis right here in our town.\n\n975\n00:53:50.960 --> 00:53:55.820\nAnd every August,\nthe default terms starts and\n\n976\n00:53:55.820 --> 00:53:59.279\nthey add 30,000 new freshmen.\n\n977\n00:53:59.279 --> 00:54:04.470\n30,000 new students come\nin every year in August.\n\n978\n00:54:04.470 --> 00:54:04.970\nRight.\n\n979\n00:54:04.970 --> 00:54:06.010\nIt grows each year.\n\n980\n00:54:06.010 --> 00:54:07.350\nActually, it might be\nbigger than that now.\n\n981\n00:54:07.350 --> 00:54:10.920\nLast time I talked to somebody over there\nwas 30,000 So, that means in August,\n\n982\n00:54:10.920 --> 00:54:14.900\nthey've got to create\n30,000 new user accounts.\n\n983\n00:54:14.900 --> 00:54:15.530\nAll right.\n\n984\n00:54:15.530 --> 00:54:18.940\nWell, they might not want to\ncreate those accounts today.\n\n985\n00:54:18.940 --> 00:54:21.510\nRight, we're in June right now,\nso it's a little early.\n\n986\n00:54:21.510 --> 00:54:24.310\nThey might You don't want\nto have them wait and\n\n987\n00:54:24.310 --> 00:54:28.580\nhave them create at midnight the day\nof- or the day before classes start.\n\n988\n00:54:28.580 --> 00:54:32.480\nAnd that way these students can't try to\nlog in early, can't try to get access.\n\n989\n00:54:32.480 --> 00:54:34.870\nTheir user accounts just don't even exist.\n\n990\n00:54:34.870 --> 00:54:37.870\nSo we write a big script,\na script that will go through and\n\n991\n00:54:37.870 --> 00:54:41.890\ncreate these 30,000 accounts and put them\nin place and assign their passwords and\n\n992\n00:54:41.890 --> 00:54:43.380\nmake them active, okay.\n\n993\n00:54:43.380 --> 00:54:44.720\nWe could just make them ahead of time and\n\n994\n00:54:44.720 --> 00:54:47.260\nmake them inactive but\nmaybe I don't even want that, right.\n\n995\n00:54:47.260 --> 00:54:51.570\nSo I write this script and\nthen I can use the add command to say,\n\n996\n00:54:51.570 --> 00:54:55.160\nat midnight run this script,\nand it will do it, right.\n\n997\n00:54:55.160 --> 00:54:57.070\nThe add command is really simple.\n\n998\n00:54:57.070 --> 00:55:01.720\nIf you run man at,\nyou'll see the syntax for it and\n\n999\n00:55:01.720 --> 00:55:06.310\nyou can use at followed by\nwhat it is you want to run,\n\n1000\n00:55:06.310 --> 00:55:11.350\nand then followed by a time,\nwhen that time is that you want it to run.\n\n1001\n00:55:11.350 --> 00:55:14.230\nNow you can schedule more\nthan one thing with at.\n\n1002\n00:55:14.230 --> 00:55:19.030\nSo you have an at q, the q is the list\nof all the things that you scheduled and\n\n1003\n00:55:19.030 --> 00:55:21.890\nso we can view those and\nsee what's in the q and\n\n1004\n00:55:21.890 --> 00:55:24.330\nyou can create multiple q's if you want.\n\n1005\n00:55:24.330 --> 00:55:28.420\nSo you'll see the at dash q option and\nyou can create various names for things.\n\n1006\n00:55:28.420 --> 00:55:29.900\nSo if you need to categorize this.\n\n1007\n00:55:29.900 --> 00:55:31.550\nIf you use it a lot.\n\n1008\n00:55:31.550 --> 00:55:33.100\nBut most of us don't do that.\n\n1009\n00:55:33.100 --> 00:55:37.630\nIf you're going to be using something like\nthis a lot you'll typically use to do it.\n\n1010\n00:55:37.630 --> 00:55:40.090\nBut if you're just doing\nsomething that's a one time thing.\n\n1011\n00:55:40.090 --> 00:55:41.180\nYou want to fire it up.\n\n1012\n00:55:41.180 --> 00:55:44.980\nyou can do this, when you schedule\nsomething with at, you also have at RM,\n\n1013\n00:55:44.980 --> 00:55:48.140\nthat you can use to remove\nthings that you've scheduled.\n\n1014\n00:55:48.140 --> 00:55:51.870\nSo it's really three commands,\nat, to create the job.\n\n1015\n00:55:51.870 --> 00:55:54.460\nAt queue, to view the jobs, and\n\n1016\n00:55:54.460 --> 00:55:59.730\nthen at Rm to remove the jobs If you\ndon't want them to execute, right?\n\n1017\n00:55:59.730 --> 00:56:01.820\nOtherwise, once they execute,\nthey go away anyway.\n\n1018\n00:56:01.820 --> 00:56:05.690\nIf you say to run at midnight,\nmidnight happens, the job runs, and\n\n1019\n00:56:05.690 --> 00:56:07.170\nthen it's gone, okay?\n\n1020\n00:56:07.170 --> 00:56:08.858\nIt's not like it's gonna\nbe a repetitious thing.\n\n1021\n00:56:08.858 --> 00:56:11.830\nFor repetitious things, we use cron.\n\n1022\n00:56:11.830 --> 00:56:15.081\nAll right, so\nif we wanna take a look at the at command,\n\n1023\n00:56:15.081 --> 00:56:17.011\nit is Pretty straightforward.\n\n1024\n00:56:17.011 --> 00:56:21.923\nWe can just say something like,\none of things appreciate about that\n\n1025\n00:56:21.923 --> 00:56:26.220\nit takes the time syntax in\nseveral different format.\n\n1026\n00:56:26.220 --> 00:56:27.650\nSo, you can almost put the time and\n\n1027\n00:56:27.650 --> 00:56:31.620\ndate and stuff in there any way\nthat you could think of it.\n\n1028\n00:56:31.620 --> 00:56:39.220\nOne of the textbook-type examples\nto say at 3PM Friday, all right?\n\n1029\n00:56:39.220 --> 00:56:44.140\nFairly plain English here,\njust at 3PM on Friday,\n\n1030\n00:56:44.140 --> 00:56:48.370\nand then you just press Enter, and\nit takes you to the app prompt, and\n\n1031\n00:56:48.370 --> 00:56:50.770\nnow you type what you want\nto have happened, okay?\n\n1032\n00:56:50.770 --> 00:56:55.380\nYou can punch in a series of commands, you\ncan punch in a script, you can punch in\n\n1033\n00:56:55.380 --> 00:57:01.360\nall sorts of different things, so\nI might just do a shutdown -r now, right?\n\n1034\n00:57:01.360 --> 00:57:04.449\nSo, I want it to reboot, and I press Enter\nand now I can start to put in additional\n\n1035\n00:57:04.449 --> 00:57:07.188\ncommands that you probably wouldn't\nhave any additional ones here.\n\n1036\n00:57:07.188 --> 00:57:10.272\nI can have one that called a script\nthat created the user accounts,\n\n1037\n00:57:10.272 --> 00:57:13.302\nanother one that called the script\nthat assigned the passwords,\n\n1038\n00:57:13.302 --> 00:57:16.936\na third one that called the script that\ngenerated an email out to the students to\n\n1039\n00:57:16.936 --> 00:57:18.939\nlet them know their accounts were active.\n\n1040\n00:57:18.939 --> 00:57:24.430\nAll the various things that I want\nto happen at 3 PM on Friday, okay?\n\n1041\n00:57:24.430 --> 00:57:29.296\nWhen I'm done, this is the trickiest part,\nis remembering, it's Ctrl+D.\n\n1042\n00:57:29.296 --> 00:57:33.645\nShoot, Ctrl+D is what gets you out\nof that, and I pressed it twice.\n\n1043\n00:57:33.645 --> 00:57:37.023\nCtrl+D also exits you from\nyour session [LAUGH], so\n\n1044\n00:57:37.023 --> 00:57:39.390\nI accidentally got all the way out.\n\n1045\n00:57:39.390 --> 00:57:40.780\nWhat user was I logged in as, root?\n\n1046\n00:57:40.780 --> 00:57:41.390\n>> I believe so.\n\n1047\n00:57:42.500 --> 00:57:43.730\n>> I guess we'll find out.\n\n1048\n00:57:43.730 --> 00:57:47.800\nBecause now I scheduled something,\nhow do I know it actually got created?\n\n1049\n00:57:47.800 --> 00:57:51.430\nI can use at queue, and at queue will\nshow if I've got something scheduled.\n\n1050\n00:57:51.430 --> 00:57:55.915\nI can see that root does have a job\nscheduled, and if I look at that time,\n\n1051\n00:57:55.915 --> 00:58:01.140\nit's 3:00 PM or 15:00 on June 27th,\nwhich is probably Friday.\n\n1052\n00:58:01.140 --> 00:58:03.710\nI have a full accounting [LAUGH],\nso it is scheduled.\n\n1053\n00:58:03.710 --> 00:58:08.060\nThere's a job list there and\nit was the at command that did it, and so\n\n1054\n00:58:08.060 --> 00:58:14.620\nit's going to basically just sit there and\nwait and run at that time, okay?\n\n1055\n00:58:14.620 --> 00:58:17.720\nNow the at queue command let's me\nview that queue, and you'll see some\n\n1056\n00:58:17.720 --> 00:58:22.460\nother different things that we can use if\nwe've created separate queues or whatever,\n\n1057\n00:58:22.460 --> 00:58:25.340\nthat we might want to specify to look\nin there with a little more detail.\n\n1058\n00:58:25.340 --> 00:58:30.720\nBut, for the most part, it's scheduled,\nit's set to run, and it is going to run at\n\n1059\n00:58:30.720 --> 00:58:38.943\na particular time in [INAUDIBLE],\nright?\n\n1060\n00:58:38.943 --> 00:58:42.620\nNow, if I decide I don't want\nthat job to actually run,\n\n1061\n00:58:42.620 --> 00:58:45.100\nI don't want my system to\nreboot at 3:00 pm on Friday.\n\n1062\n00:58:45.100 --> 00:58:49.420\nI can just do atrm followed by\nthe job number, I've only got one job,\n\n1063\n00:58:49.420 --> 00:58:52.240\nso job number 1, and if I run atq now,\n\n1064\n00:58:52.240 --> 00:58:57.240\nI can see that it's gone and I'm no longer\ngonna reboot at 3PM on Friday, all right?\n\n1065\n00:58:58.510 --> 00:59:01.630\nSo at, really useful just for\none-time things, right?\n\n1066\n00:59:01.630 --> 00:59:05.500\nI want something to run at one time,\njust at 3PM on a Friday or\n\n1067\n00:59:05.500 --> 00:59:08.860\nwhatever, they don't really do\nit justice here in the article.\n\n1068\n00:59:08.860 --> 00:59:12.194\nLet me see if I can find out a quick,\nI know I found a Web page once\n\n1069\n00:59:12.194 --> 00:59:15.356\nthat listed all the different\ntime formats it would take.\n\n1070\n00:59:17.438 --> 00:59:24.813\nIt will take all sorts of stuff,\nlet's see if this one does it.\n\n1071\n00:59:27.606 --> 00:59:31.142\nI found an article at one point where\nthey actually went to in there,\n\n1072\n00:59:31.142 --> 00:59:35.051\nlike listed all of the different formats\nthat you could put the time in And,\n\n1073\n00:59:35.051 --> 00:59:36.500\nit's really impressive.\n\n1074\n00:59:36.500 --> 00:59:40.010\nSo, you can pretty much type\nit any way you want and\n\n1075\n00:59:40.010 --> 00:59:42.690\nit'll understand and sort it out.\n\n1076\n00:59:44.730 --> 00:59:46.530\nThis is not it.\n\n1077\n00:59:46.530 --> 00:59:49.840\nAll right, maybe I'll look for it later,\nbut, yeah, it is really flexible so\n\n1078\n00:59:49.840 --> 00:59:51.050\nit's kind of just plain English.\n\n1079\n00:59:51.050 --> 00:59:57.580\nYou say the time, am, pm or you do the 24\nhour format and then you specify the day,\n\n1080\n00:59:57.580 --> 01:00:01.850\nyou can do a date even so\nyou can say March 3rd or whatever but.\n\n1081\n01:00:01.850 --> 01:00:03.650\nAt, we don't usually go beyond 24 hours.\n\n1082\n01:00:03.650 --> 01:00:07.930\nIf you're gonna go beyond 24 hours, you\ntypically move over and use Cron instead.\n\n1083\n01:00:09.970 --> 01:00:12.690\nAll right, so that's the at command,\npretty simple,\n\n1084\n01:00:12.690 --> 01:00:15.690\nnot too much involved there.\n\n1085\n01:00:15.690 --> 01:00:20.897\nJust, again, at a time or\nat what you want to do followed by a time.\n\n1086\n01:00:26.272 --> 01:00:27.430\nAll right, Cron.\n\n1087\n01:00:27.430 --> 01:00:30.100\nCron is the more powerful\nof the two commands\n\n1088\n01:00:30.100 --> 01:00:32.800\nbecause Cron will let you\ndo one-time things, but\n\n1089\n01:00:32.800 --> 01:00:36.700\nit will also let you do repetitious\nthings, things over and over again.\n\n1090\n01:00:36.700 --> 01:00:40.010\nAnd they're stored in a nice little\nfile that's preserved through reboots,\n\n1091\n01:00:40.010 --> 01:00:42.400\nthat will be accessible.\n\n1092\n01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:43.910\nYou can create cron schedules for\n\n1093\n01:00:43.910 --> 01:00:47.650\nyour entire system and\ncron schedules for individual users.\n\n1094\n01:00:47.650 --> 01:00:49.860\nYou have a ton of power with cron.\n\n1095\n01:00:49.860 --> 01:00:51.130\nIn fact, while I'm thinking of power,\n\n1096\n01:00:51.130 --> 01:00:54.720\nI just remembered something I\nforgot about the at command.\n\n1097\n01:00:54.720 --> 01:00:58.330\nLet me double back, I hate to do this but\nI want to make sure we cover everything.\n\n1098\n01:00:58.330 --> 01:01:02.860\nThe at command by default\nanybody can use the at command.\n\n1099\n01:01:04.590 --> 01:01:05.552\nYou may not want that.\n\n1100\n01:01:05.552 --> 01:01:08.810\nYou may not want your users Scheduling\nactivities on your system so\n\n1101\n01:01:08.810 --> 01:01:10.190\nwe may want to block that.\n\n1102\n01:01:10.190 --> 01:01:13.090\nAnd we can do it in chron also which\nis what made me think of this.\n\n1103\n01:01:13.090 --> 01:01:16.930\nSo for the at and the chron commands,\nwe'll just do both at the same time,\n\n1104\n01:01:16.930 --> 01:01:22.870\nif you want to prevent people from being\nable to use them inside of slash etc you\n\n1105\n01:01:25.180 --> 01:01:31.910\ncan create files Called at deny,\nor at dot deny,\n\n1106\n01:01:31.910 --> 01:01:37.410\nor at dot allow, and you can create\ncron dot deny and cron dot allow.\n\n1107\n01:01:37.410 --> 01:01:41.540\nWhen somebody runs cron or at,\nit's gonna look for those files, so\n\n1108\n01:01:41.540 --> 01:01:45.310\nwith at, if it finds at at dot deny,\n\n1109\n01:01:45.310 --> 01:01:51.050\nthe at dot deny file will contain\na list Of users not allowed to use app.\n\n1110\n01:01:51.050 --> 01:01:59.330\nSo, what I would do is I would,\nI'll just divide /etc/at.deny, okay?\n\n1111\n01:01:59.330 --> 01:02:02.210\nAnd in here I might put the bsmith, okay?\n\n1112\n01:02:02.210 --> 01:02:06.180\nOr jdoe or whoever, just one after\nthe other, one user on each line.\n\n1113\n01:02:06.180 --> 01:02:10.990\nThis are usernames That\nare denied from using at.\n\n1114\n01:02:10.990 --> 01:02:13.300\nSo if I've got specific\npeople that I wanna block,\n\n1115\n01:02:13.300 --> 01:02:17.000\nI put them in here like this and\nI block them, Okay?\n\n1116\n01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:21.400\nAnd then we just save it and now anytime\nsomebody runs at That is going to look\n\n1117\n01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:24.280\nat at.deny and see if they're in\nthe denial list and stop them.\n\n1118\n01:02:24.280 --> 01:02:26.680\nIf they're not in the denial list\nthey'll be allowed to run it.\n\n1119\n01:02:26.680 --> 01:02:30.950\nOkay, now that is a very\npermissive approach.\n\n1120\n01:02:30.950 --> 01:02:34.600\nWe'll let everybody run it except for\nthe people here on the list.\n\n1121\n01:02:34.600 --> 01:02:38.310\nYou might wanna go\nthe restrictive approach instead.\n\n1122\n01:02:38.310 --> 01:02:43.200\nThe restrictive says nobody can run\nit except for these specific people.\n\n1123\n01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:48.230\nIf you wanna do that, you get rid of\nthe at.deny file, you delete it and you\n\n1124\n01:02:48.230 --> 01:02:52.840\ncreate an at.allow file All right, you're\nreally only gonna have one or the other.\n\n1125\n01:02:52.840 --> 01:02:54.320\nYou'll either have a dot deny or\n\n1126\n01:02:54.320 --> 01:02:57.270\nyou'll have a dot allow,\nyou won't have both cuz they conflict.\n\n1127\n01:02:57.270 --> 01:03:02.420\nSo with at.allow,\nit says nobody can run at except for\n\n1128\n01:03:02.420 --> 01:03:09.170\nthe people in this list, and so you might\ncreate that, so if I do /etc/at.allow,\n\n1129\n01:03:09.170 --> 01:03:15.970\nand in here I might put root And\ndeposes, okay?\n\n1130\n01:03:15.970 --> 01:03:21.730\nSo now the root user can use at and\ndeposit can use at, nobody else can.\n\n1131\n01:03:21.730 --> 01:03:27.088\nNow it's restricted down to just\nthose users, so those files at.deny,\n\n1132\n01:03:27.088 --> 01:03:32.770\nat.allow, and the same goes for\nchron.deny and chron.allow.\n\n1133\n01:03:32.770 --> 01:03:35.890\nThose files can be used\ncontrol who has access.\n\n1134\n01:03:35.890 --> 01:03:41.040\nRemember to only use one of them,\nwell, one for each program.So I can\n\n1135\n01:03:41.040 --> 01:03:46.560\nhave an @.deny or an @.allow,\nor I can have a or allow.\n\n1136\n01:03:46.560 --> 01:03:52.190\nBut I'm not gonna have both for or\nboth for You will have one for each.\n\n1137\n01:03:52.190 --> 01:03:53.460\nIf you use them at all, right?\n\n1138\n01:03:53.460 --> 01:03:58.507\nIf you don't have them, if they are just\nnot there and anyone can run it, it's\n\n1139\n01:03:58.507 --> 01:04:04.341\njust open, anybody can use it, and you'll\nnotice on my system, there was no @.allow.\n\n1140\n01:04:04.341 --> 01:04:08.427\nThere was an @.deny, it was empty,\nso nobody was denied,\n\n1141\n01:04:08.427 --> 01:04:12.208\neverybody had access, and\nthis same thing is for cron.\n\n1142\n01:04:12.208 --> 01:04:15.082\nI could see how I got a cron.deny.\n\n1143\n01:04:15.082 --> 01:04:18.083\nInside of /etc cron.deny, and\n\n1144\n01:04:18.083 --> 01:04:23.585\nif I take a look at what's in it,\nI can see it's empty, too.\n\n1145\n01:04:23.585 --> 01:04:26.220\nSo even though it exists\nthere's nothing in there.\n\n1146\n01:04:26.220 --> 01:04:27.540\nSo everybody can run cron,\n\n1147\n01:04:27.540 --> 01:04:32.440\neverybody can run at by default,\nwe can restrict them right there.\n\n1148\n01:04:32.440 --> 01:04:36.630\nI wanted to make sure I mentioned that,\nnow cron itself is really cool.\n\n1149\n01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:41.860\nCron, it's a daemon, there's a cron.d,\ncron daemon, that's running in\n\n1150\n01:04:41.860 --> 01:04:45.605\nthe background, and it's performing\nactivities for us at set intervals.\n\n1151\n01:04:45.605 --> 01:04:49.610\nLinux makes extensive use of this,\nall the distros do, so\n\n1152\n01:04:49.610 --> 01:04:52.500\ncron is part of your base install,\nit's not something you have to install.\n\n1153\n01:04:52.500 --> 01:04:57.120\nI don't think I've ever encountered a\ndistro that didn't have cron installed and\n\n1154\n01:04:57.120 --> 01:05:00.450\nrunning by default because\nit really is a core service.\n\n1155\n01:05:00.450 --> 01:05:03.240\nAnd so it's performing various activities.\n\n1156\n01:05:03.240 --> 01:05:06.110\nThe basic usage of cron\nis actually really easy.\n\n1157\n01:05:06.110 --> 01:05:10.342\nIf you look inside of /etc,\nyou've got a cron.deny or\n\n1158\n01:05:10.342 --> 01:05:15.385\ncron.allow, if you've got them,\nbut you'll also have a series\n\n1159\n01:05:15.385 --> 01:05:20.354\nof folders like cron.daily,\ncron.hourly, cron.monthly.\n\n1160\n01:05:23.361 --> 01:05:26.360\nLet me filter my list here.\n\n1161\n01:05:26.360 --> 01:05:32.191\nSo, here I'm looking in /etc, and\nin /etc I can see a lot of directories,\n\n1162\n01:05:32.191 --> 01:05:37.318\ncron.d cron.daily, hourly,\nmonthly, weekly, those guys.\n\n1163\n01:05:37.318 --> 01:05:42.652\nIf I wanna have a script that runs every\nday, or every month or once an hour\n\n1164\n01:05:42.652 --> 01:05:48.704\nlike backing up SQL transaction logs,\nsomething like that I would do every hour.\n\n1165\n01:05:48.704 --> 01:05:53.715\nFor something like that, I can just write\nthe script and stick it in those folders.\n\n1166\n01:05:53.715 --> 01:05:55.055\nIf I write a script and\n\n1167\n01:05:55.055 --> 01:05:59.180\nI stick it in cron.daily then once\na day that script will get run.\n\n1168\n01:06:00.760 --> 01:06:02.500\nSo, when's it gonna get run?\n\n1169\n01:06:02.500 --> 01:06:04.310\nI don't know, once a day.\n\n1170\n01:06:04.310 --> 01:06:08.020\nSo, if I don't really care about\nexactly when, if it's okay,\n\n1171\n01:06:08.020 --> 01:06:11.470\njust run it once a day, I don't care when,\nyou can write a script and\n\n1172\n01:06:11.470 --> 01:06:15.860\nchuck it in one of those folders, cron\nwill automatically run it once a day or\n\n1173\n01:06:15.860 --> 01:06:19.530\nonce a month, once an hour, once a week,\nbased on which folder you stick it in.\n\n1174\n01:06:20.630 --> 01:06:23.960\nIt does a really good about about\npicking the same time week after week or\n\n1175\n01:06:23.960 --> 01:06:27.870\nmonth after month, but if the system\nis busy or if there was a reboot or\n\n1176\n01:06:27.870 --> 01:06:30.785\nwhatever, it'll move it and\nthat's kind of nice.\n\n1177\n01:06:30.785 --> 01:06:32.825\nMaybe you want it to move it,\nif there was a reboot,\n\n1178\n01:06:32.825 --> 01:06:36.155\ndon't just skip running that command,\ngo ahead and run it, do whatever it is.\n\n1179\n01:06:36.155 --> 01:06:39.895\nAnd you'll see there's a lot of Linux\nmaintenance activities that are in these.\n\n1180\n01:06:39.895 --> 01:06:43.780\nIf I go into cron.daily and\n\n1181\n01:06:43.780 --> 01:06:47.660\nI pull up a list, I'll see logrotate,\nwe're gonna talk about later.\n\n1182\n01:06:47.660 --> 01:06:51.660\nCups, which is the printing system,\nwe've got some read ahead jobs.\n\n1183\n01:06:51.660 --> 01:06:55.489\nWe've got various activities that are\nalready in here that are just part of our\n\n1184\n01:06:55.489 --> 01:06:56.350\nbasic OS.\n\n1185\n01:06:56.350 --> 01:07:00.700\nIf we look at chron.monthly,\nI think that one's empty.\n\n1186\n01:07:02.080 --> 01:07:05.860\nThere's a read ahead in here just looking\nfor jobs that are coming down the line,\n\n1187\n01:07:05.860 --> 01:07:07.795\nthere's not anything\nreally exciting in there.\n\n1188\n01:07:07.795 --> 01:07:12.210\nCron.weekly, weekly is empty,\n\n1189\n01:07:12.210 --> 01:07:15.290\nI knew one of them was empty, so\nit may or may not have stuff in there.\n\n1190\n01:07:15.290 --> 01:07:18.510\nYou can create scripts or jobs and\njust chuck them in there, and\n\n1191\n01:07:18.510 --> 01:07:20.180\nthen they'll be run at those intervals.\n\n1192\n01:07:21.860 --> 01:07:26.340\nBut, more often than not we don't\nwanna leave things up to chance.\n\n1193\n01:07:26.340 --> 01:07:29.610\nWhen I schedule something,\nI want it to run at a particular time,\n\n1194\n01:07:29.610 --> 01:07:33.200\non a particular day, at a particular\nmonth, and that's important to me.\n\n1195\n01:07:34.720 --> 01:07:38.150\nTo do that,\nif it's a system wide activity,\n\n1196\n01:07:38.150 --> 01:07:42.366\nif it's something that affects the system\nas a whole and I'm configuring it as root,\n\n1197\n01:07:42.366 --> 01:07:48.470\ninside of etc, we have a file called\ncrontab, and it's the cron table.\n\n1198\n01:07:48.470 --> 01:07:51.950\nIt's a table of jobs that we've\nscheduled to occur at a certain time.\n\n1199\n01:07:53.010 --> 01:08:00.410\nSo, if I edit that file, so\nI'm gonna edit that /etc/crontab,\n\n1200\n01:08:00.410 --> 01:08:03.130\nby default there's no jobs in here.\n\n1201\n01:08:03.130 --> 01:08:07.540\nSo, when I look in here, there's not much,\nI'm seeing that there's a shell so\n\n1202\n01:08:07.540 --> 01:08:09.810\nwhen these jobs run they have\nto run from inside of a shell.\n\n1203\n01:08:09.810 --> 01:08:10.940\nSo, what shell's it gonna use?\n\n1204\n01:08:10.940 --> 01:08:13.700\nIt's gonna use bash, and what path?\n\n1205\n01:08:13.700 --> 01:08:15.015\nIs it gonna look for executables?\n\n1206\n01:08:15.015 --> 01:08:17.930\nCuz I'm calling executables,\nit's gotta be able to find them.\n\n1207\n01:08:17.930 --> 01:08:21.820\nAnd when a job has a problem,\nwho does it send an email to, and\n\n1208\n01:08:21.820 --> 01:08:23.290\nby default, it's root.\n\n1209\n01:08:23.290 --> 01:08:26.855\nAnd then, what directory does it start\nin when it starts to run something,\n\n1210\n01:08:26.855 --> 01:08:28.910\nand the default is the root directory or\nslash.\n\n1211\n01:08:30.220 --> 01:08:32.820\nAnd then we create our jobs.\n\n1212\n01:08:32.820 --> 01:08:37.640\nNow, when we show a job to somebody,\nlike a cron job, it can be very confusing.\n\n1213\n01:08:37.640 --> 01:08:44.649\nA lot of people get really confused\nby the numbers that we specify,\n\n1214\n01:08:44.649 --> 01:08:50.030\nand so if I see a job that\nlooks something like this,\n\n1215\n01:08:50.030 --> 01:08:54.181\nand I'll leave that one at [INAUDIBLE].\n\n1216\n01:09:00.741 --> 01:09:01.542\nThere.\n\n1217\n01:09:01.542 --> 01:09:03.460\nThis is an example of a cron job.\n\n1218\n01:09:04.720 --> 01:09:07.900\nWhat I'm doing is I'm telling\nthe system that I want it to reboot,\n\n1219\n01:09:07.900 --> 01:09:09.591\nI want it to run shutdown -r now.\n\n1220\n01:09:09.591 --> 01:09:11.850\nThat's the command that I want to run.\n\n1221\n01:09:11.850 --> 01:09:12.820\nI'm leaving something out, shoot.\n\n1222\n01:09:14.190 --> 01:09:16.510\nThe user,\nI have to say what user to run as.\n\n1223\n01:09:16.510 --> 01:09:20.930\nSo I'm saying I want it to run shutdown\n-r now, and I wanna run it as root.\n\n1224\n01:09:20.930 --> 01:09:23.295\nThat's the user that's\ngonna be running this.\n\n1225\n01:09:23.295 --> 01:09:26.855\nAnd then here, these random numbers,\n\n1226\n01:09:26.855 --> 01:09:30.805\nor what seems like random numbers, that's\nactually saying when I want it to run.\n\n1227\n01:09:30.805 --> 01:09:39.022\nSo what I'm saying is,\nminutes, hours, day, month.\n\n1228\n01:09:39.022 --> 01:09:43.322\nI'm saying on March 12th,\nthe 3rd month of the year, the 12th day.\n\n1229\n01:09:43.322 --> 01:09:49.012\nSo, on March 12th, at 1:15 AM,\nI want you to shut down and reboot.\n\n1230\n01:09:50.210 --> 01:09:52.220\nThat's how I remember this,\nis I always read it backwards.\n\n1231\n01:09:52.220 --> 01:09:57.950\nSo kind of going backwards,\nyou've got month, day, hour, minute.\n\n1232\n01:09:57.950 --> 01:10:00.000\nIt's getting smaller,\nsmaller, and smaller.\n\n1233\n01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.900\nThe only outlier is the fifth number\nwhich is the day of the week.\n\n1234\n01:10:02.900 --> 01:10:08.900\nSo, here if I said two,\nthat would be Tuesday, two is Tuesday.\n\n1235\n01:10:08.900 --> 01:10:11.260\nZero is Sunday One is Monday,\ntwo is Tuesday.\n\n1236\n01:10:11.260 --> 01:10:15.078\nSo, if I said Tuesday here,\nyou can actually just type in tue or\n\n1237\n01:10:15.078 --> 01:10:15.950\nput it in a 2.\n\n1238\n01:10:15.950 --> 01:10:20.611\nSo, the it would say on March 12,\nif it's a Tuesday,\n\n1239\n01:10:20.611 --> 01:10:23.700\ngo ahead and run blah, blah, blah.\n\n1240\n01:10:23.700 --> 01:10:27.550\nSo, you can specify that kind of thing and\nget really specific.\n\n1241\n01:10:27.550 --> 01:10:28.990\nYou can also do ranges.\n\n1242\n01:10:28.990 --> 01:10:35.440\nIf you wanna get the first Tuesday of\nthe month then you would just say for\n\n1243\n01:10:35.440 --> 01:10:40.670\nthe day range, you would say 1-7,\n\n1244\n01:10:40.670 --> 01:10:44.140\nand then for the day of the week\nyou would specify 2 for Tuesday.\n\n1245\n01:10:44.140 --> 01:10:45.878\nSo if there's a Tuesday on the 1st,\n\n1246\n01:10:45.878 --> 01:10:48.747\nI guess you would do the 1st\nthrough the 6th wouldn't you?\n\n1247\n01:10:48.747 --> 01:10:51.620\nIt would be, no,\nyou'd do the 1st through the 7th.\n\n1248\n01:10:51.620 --> 01:10:53.990\nYeah, cuz it only would be one only\nTuesday in a seven day period.\n\n1249\n01:10:53.990 --> 01:10:57.317\nAnd so if you said days 1 through 7 and\nyou set Tuesday here,\n\n1250\n01:10:57.317 --> 01:10:59.798\nthat would be the first\nTuesday of the month,\n\n1251\n01:10:59.798 --> 01:11:03.090\ncuz there's only gonna be one\nTuesday in day 1 through 7.\n\n1252\n01:11:03.090 --> 01:11:08.260\nSo you can get really, really specific\nlike that to point out a particular day,\n\n1253\n01:11:08.260 --> 01:11:09.890\nand same thing with the time.\n\n1254\n01:11:09.890 --> 01:11:14.700\nNow if you're not specific, if you don't\ncare, you can put an asterisk in there.\n\n1255\n01:11:14.700 --> 01:11:16.400\nSo for example a backup script.\n\n1256\n01:11:16.400 --> 01:11:22.914\nIf I wanna run a backup every night at 3\nAM, then what I might put in here is 0 3,\n\n1257\n01:11:22.914 --> 01:11:28.390\nwhich is gonna be 3 AM, the 3rd hour,\nthe 0th minute of the day.\n\n1258\n01:11:28.390 --> 01:11:35.870\nAnd then I put star for the day, star for\nthe month, star for the day of the week.\n\n1259\n01:11:35.870 --> 01:11:41.815\nThat right there is saying every single\nday, everyday, everyday of the week,\n\n1260\n01:11:41.815 --> 01:11:46.380\nevery month, at 3:00 AM,\nI want you to run backup.sh.\n\n1261\n01:11:46.380 --> 01:11:51.090\nI want you to call this script,\n/root/backup.sh and run it at 3:00 am.\n\n1262\n01:11:53.330 --> 01:11:57.460\nIt's a little confusing the first few\ntimes you look at it, but the file is so\n\n1263\n01:11:57.460 --> 01:11:59.070\nwell documented.\n\n1264\n01:11:59.070 --> 01:12:01.310\nThis little diagram here,\nit might look a little confusing but\n\n1265\n01:12:01.310 --> 01:12:02.710\nit makes a lot of sense.\n\n1266\n01:12:02.710 --> 01:12:05.781\nFor the minute and it draws this arrow\nover here saying this is the minutes,\n\n1267\n01:12:05.781 --> 01:12:06.528\nthis is the hour.\n\n1268\n01:12:06.528 --> 01:12:10.641\nSo it's showing you and\nthe type of things you can put in that\n\n1269\n01:12:10.641 --> 01:12:13.861\nwill dictate what is\ngonna happen on what day.\n\n1270\n01:12:13.861 --> 01:12:18.920\nSo that is, is how cron works,\nand these are system jobs.\n\n1271\n01:12:18.920 --> 01:12:22.080\nJobe's that are gonna run regardless\nof who's logged in to the computer,\n\n1272\n01:12:22.080 --> 01:12:26.780\nregardless of what's going on at this\ntime, on this day, this action is gonna be\n\n1273\n01:12:26.780 --> 01:12:33.170\nperform and It's gonna be run as this\nuser, okay, that's the basics of cron.\n\n1274\n01:12:33.170 --> 01:12:36.260\nAnd it's incredibly useful,\nespecially for backups, right?\n\n1275\n01:12:36.260 --> 01:12:38.420\nYou want your backups to\nrun every single say,\n\n1276\n01:12:38.420 --> 01:12:41.630\nor maybe you have different\nbackups on some days than others.\n\n1277\n01:12:41.630 --> 01:12:42.320\nRight?\n\n1278\n01:12:42.320 --> 01:12:46.870\nSo maybe on Monday's I want\nto run a full backup but\n\n1279\n01:12:46.870 --> 01:12:51.490\non every other day I want to run\na incremental or differential backup.\n\n1280\n01:12:51.490 --> 01:12:52.000\nRight?\n\n1281\n01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.430\nLet's just do Sunday,\nthat will be a little easier on me.\n\n1282\n01:12:54.430 --> 01:13:02.420\nSo I might say do a full backup if\nthe day of the week is 0, so Sunday.\n\n1283\n01:13:02.420 --> 01:13:07.470\nSo on Sunday at 3 AM,\nI'm gonna do a full backup, but\n\n1284\n01:13:09.743 --> 01:13:14.371\nThen I'll just come through here,\nand I'll say 1 dash 7.\n\n1285\n01:13:21.827 --> 01:13:24.520\nOn 1-7, right?\n\n1286\n01:13:24.520 --> 01:13:28.960\nSo on Monday through Saturday I'll\ncall a different script.\n\n1287\n01:13:28.960 --> 01:13:32.360\nI'll call incrbackup.sh.\n\n1288\n01:13:32.360 --> 01:13:32.930\nAll right?\nSo\n\n1289\n01:13:32.930 --> 01:13:35.350\nby doing that 1-7 that\nmakes a big difference.\n\n1290\n01:13:35.350 --> 01:13:40.780\nThat's what's setting out the,\nexcluding Sunday basically.\n\n1291\n01:13:40.780 --> 01:13:44.120\nSo there's some difference in text you can\nuse in here to achieve your goals, but\n\n1292\n01:13:44.120 --> 01:13:47.060\nthat's kind of an example right\nthere of how we can use it.\n\n1293\n01:13:47.060 --> 01:13:50.040\nNow I've got my back up job set and\nthey are set to run.\n\n1294\n01:13:50.040 --> 01:13:50.700\nOkay?\n\n1295\n01:13:50.700 --> 01:13:51.766\nSo this is pretty cool.\n\n1296\n01:13:51.766 --> 01:13:55.980\nThis cron file root is the only\nperson allowed to work with it.\n\n1297\n01:13:55.980 --> 01:13:59.380\nYou got to be the root user to go in here\nbecause this affects the whole system.\n\n1298\n01:13:59.380 --> 01:14:01.920\nSo the regular user is not\nallowed to manipulate this.\n\n1299\n01:14:01.920 --> 01:14:02.490\nAll right?\n\n1300\n01:14:02.490 --> 01:14:05.095\nBut when I mentioned that\nthe users can use cron right?\n\n1301\n01:14:05.095 --> 01:14:07.559\nbut if they can't edit this file,\nhow do they do it?\n\n1302\n01:14:07.559 --> 01:14:09.810\nWell, the way they do it I'm\ngonna go ahead and save that.\n\n1303\n01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:12.870\nIf you are a regular user.\n\n1304\n01:14:12.870 --> 01:14:15.400\nThere's actually command called crontab.\n\n1305\n01:14:16.940 --> 01:14:21.980\nAnd the crontab command will\nlet you view the cron table for\n\n1306\n01:14:21.980 --> 01:14:24.690\nan individual user what\nthey have scheduled.\n\n1307\n01:14:24.690 --> 01:14:29.630\nAnd if they want to schedule something\nthemselves, they can run crontab -e and\n\n1308\n01:14:29.630 --> 01:14:33.910\nit will let them modify the cron\ntable just for their account.\n\n1309\n01:14:33.910 --> 01:14:37.680\nSo if I were to jump\nover to one of my other\n\n1310\n01:14:37.680 --> 01:14:40.934\nttys where I am logged in a dpezet right?\n\n1311\n01:14:40.934 --> 01:14:42.470\nSo I am logged in as me.\n\n1312\n01:14:42.470 --> 01:14:46.940\nI can run crontab -e and\nsee it was a blank file.\n\n1313\n01:14:46.940 --> 01:14:48.690\nI can come in here and schedule a job.\n\n1314\n01:14:48.690 --> 01:14:56.010\nI can say at,\nyou know I'll do like 5:00 PM.\n\n1315\n01:14:56.010 --> 01:14:59.050\nSo, at 17:00 hours.\n\n1316\n01:15:00.140 --> 01:15:04.370\nOn any day of the month,\nany month, and for\n\n1317\n01:15:04.370 --> 01:15:07.890\nthe day of the week, I want to do,\nlet's do Monday through Friday.\n\n1318\n01:15:07.890 --> 01:15:11.860\nActually, I guess that\nwould be 1 through 6.\n\n1319\n01:15:11.860 --> 01:15:13.024\nNo, it would be 1 through 5.\n\n1320\n01:15:14.315 --> 01:15:17.225\nYou know, I got the other one wrong.\n\n1321\n01:15:17.225 --> 01:15:18.445\nI think I put 137.\nIt should 136.\n\n1322\n01:15:18.445 --> 01:15:21.925\nAnyhow, so 125.\nSo, on Monday through Friday at 5 PM as\n\n1323\n01:15:21.925 --> 01:15:26.803\nthe dpezet at user, I'm gonna call\na script that I've got on my own\n\n1324\n01:15:26.803 --> 01:15:32.010\ndirectory saying sendgohomeemail.sh,\nright.\n\n1325\n01:15:32.010 --> 01:15:36.370\nSo I'm gonna call a script that generates\nan email and sends it to me to remind me\n\n1326\n01:15:36.370 --> 01:15:39.750\nthat it's time to go home at 5:00PM\neveryday, shoot me that email.\n\n1327\n01:15:39.750 --> 01:15:40.430\nAll right?\n\n1328\n01:15:40.430 --> 01:15:45.230\nNow unfortunately for the user, they don't\nget the nice highly documented crontab, so\n\n1329\n01:15:45.230 --> 01:15:46.620\nthey have to know what they're doing,\nright?\n\n1330\n01:15:46.620 --> 01:15:51.620\nBut they can put this job in, and\nthis is gonna be a cron job for them, for\n\n1331\n01:15:51.620 --> 01:15:55.900\nthe individual user and\nif they save it, now they've got it.\n\n1332\n01:15:55.900 --> 01:15:58.610\nAnd see how it says\ninstalling a new crontab?\n\n1333\n01:15:58.610 --> 01:16:02.530\nIt's creating a cron table for\nme, so one specifically for\n\n1334\n01:16:02.530 --> 01:16:06.250\nme, and I'll now have my own crontab.\n\n1335\n01:16:06.250 --> 01:16:07.370\nOkay.\n\n1336\n01:16:07.370 --> 01:16:11.540\nNow, if I run crontab by itself.\n\n1337\n01:16:11.540 --> 01:16:12.200\nWait.\n\n1338\n01:16:12.200 --> 01:16:13.150\nIt won't go by itself.\n\n1339\n01:16:13.150 --> 01:16:18.210\nIt needs -u dpezet, there.\n\n1340\n01:16:18.210 --> 01:16:19.660\nI have to be privileged to do it.\n\n1341\n01:16:19.660 --> 01:16:21.830\nGreat.\nWell I can run crontab slash e to see it,\n\n1342\n01:16:21.830 --> 01:16:30.080\nbut as the root user I can\nrun crontab dash u dpezet.\n\n1343\n01:16:31.115 --> 01:16:32.840\nDpezet, I keep doing that.\n\n1344\n01:16:32.840 --> 01:16:38.260\nAnd it supposed to display for\nme the crontab and,\n\n1345\n01:16:38.260 --> 01:16:40.970\nI need dash L, sorry, there we go.\n\n1346\n01:16:40.970 --> 01:16:44.690\nSo if I do crontab -u dpezet\nthat's fine user and then -L for\n\n1347\n01:16:44.690 --> 01:16:48.210\nthe list, there I can see\ncrontab that dpezet has defined.\n\n1348\n01:16:48.210 --> 01:16:50.080\nSo this is that user's cron tab.\n\n1349\n01:16:51.090 --> 01:16:52.140\nIt's leaving out that dash l.\n\n1350\n01:16:52.140 --> 01:16:54.640\nBut if I look at the systems cron tab,\n\n1351\n01:16:54.640 --> 01:17:00.260\nif I look into slash etc's slash cron\ntab I don't see don presents job there.\n\n1352\n01:17:00.260 --> 01:17:02.290\nI just see the system logs.\n\n1353\n01:17:02.290 --> 01:17:07.840\nSo the users maintain their own cron\ntabs and now those jobs run for them.\n\n1354\n01:17:07.840 --> 01:17:09.244\nWe can use the cron\ncommand tab to see them.\n\n1355\n01:17:14.703 --> 01:17:16.853\nAll right, those cron tables,\nthe individual user ones,\n\n1356\n01:17:16.853 --> 01:17:18.490\nthey're actually stored somewhere funny.\n\n1357\n01:17:18.490 --> 01:17:22.550\nI don't know if this will be on the exam,\nbut just so you know there is a folder\n\n1358\n01:17:22.550 --> 01:17:27.390\ncalled slash var slash spool and\nnormally are print jobs go there but\n\n1359\n01:17:27.390 --> 01:17:30.660\nif you poke around in the spool folder\nyou'll see that there's a chron folder in\n\n1360\n01:17:30.660 --> 01:17:34.960\nthere also and if you look that's\nwhere the user chron tabs are going.\n\n1361\n01:17:34.960 --> 01:17:37.710\nI don't know if that will show up on\nthe exam but just show you know for\n\n1362\n01:17:37.710 --> 01:17:42.550\nreal life lan /var/spool/cron that's\nwhere the user cron tables go.\n\n1363\n01:17:42.550 --> 01:17:47.518\nSo they just park right there and\nif I look in that file,\n\n1364\n01:17:47.518 --> 01:17:51.411\nif I look in a, I'll do a more ./dpezet.\n\n1365\n01:17:52.869 --> 01:17:55.020\nAnd I can just see the job right there.\n\n1366\n01:17:55.020 --> 01:17:58.630\nSo if I wanna see a bunch of users,\ninstead of doing the crontab -l,\n\n1367\n01:17:58.630 --> 01:18:02.420\nI can just go in and poke around\nin this folder and find them too.\n\n1368\n01:18:04.150 --> 01:18:06.510\nSo that is where we see\nthe user cron jobs.\n\n1369\n01:18:06.510 --> 01:18:11.398\nWhere was there anything else,\nlet's see I mentioned\n\n1370\n01:18:11.398 --> 01:18:16.600\ncron.allow, cron.deny,\nI showed you those folders.\n\n1371\n01:18:16.600 --> 01:18:20.430\nJust to show you a more complex example,\nlet me show you log rotate.\n\n1372\n01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:25.800\nIn one of the earlier shows,\nwe talked about the cis log.\n\n1373\n01:18:25.800 --> 01:18:28.290\nThe logging that's going on in our system.\n\n1374\n01:18:28.290 --> 01:18:33.830\nAnd if we browse into /bar slash log\nwe will find in there the messages\n\n1375\n01:18:33.830 --> 01:18:38.720\nlog and messages, it's going to grow and\ngrow as the system runs.\n\n1376\n01:18:38.720 --> 01:18:40.200\nNow, my system has only been up for a day.\n\n1377\n01:18:40.200 --> 01:18:41.610\nI just installed it this morning.\n\n1378\n01:18:41.610 --> 01:18:44.470\nBut in the other shows you might\nhave noticed there was messages and\n\n1379\n01:18:44.470 --> 01:18:46.450\nthere was messages and\n\n1380\n01:18:46.450 --> 01:18:51.370\na date after it, where it had archived\nthe old logs and created a new log file.\n\n1381\n01:18:51.370 --> 01:18:52.820\nHow did it know to do that?\n\n1382\n01:18:52.820 --> 01:18:56.690\nIt used a program called Log Rotate and\nLog Rotate is what does that,\n\n1383\n01:18:56.690 --> 01:18:59.280\nit exports our old logs so\nthey don't get over written, right so\n\n1384\n01:18:59.280 --> 01:19:00.750\nwe still have that history.\n\n1385\n01:19:00.750 --> 01:19:03.810\nWell, it uses a cron job to do that and\n\n1386\n01:19:03.810 --> 01:19:07.550\nif we wanted to take a look at that,\nlogrotate, it's a daily activity.\n\n1387\n01:19:07.550 --> 01:19:15.910\nSo if I go back into /etc/cron.daily,\nI can find find logrotate right there.\n\n1388\n01:19:15.910 --> 01:19:18.930\nAnd if I take a look at\nwhat it does Logrotate.\n\n1389\n01:19:18.930 --> 01:19:21.820\nHere we go.\n\n1390\n01:19:21.820 --> 01:19:24.880\nIt's not a terribly complex one,\nbut what it's doing is looking for\n\n1391\n01:19:24.880 --> 01:19:27.300\na logrotate configuration file.\n\n1392\n01:19:27.300 --> 01:19:31.240\nAnd if it finds that file then it\nperforms the activity that's in it.\n\n1393\n01:19:31.240 --> 01:19:37.030\nAnd so you'll see /usr/bin/logger -t\nlogrotate so it's doing a logrotate.\n\n1394\n01:19:37.030 --> 01:19:39.370\nAnd it will generate\nan alert if it has an error.\n\n1395\n01:19:39.370 --> 01:19:43.740\nOtherwise it'll exit out if\nlogrotate is not configured and\n\n1396\n01:19:43.740 --> 01:19:46.750\nin redhat based OSes,\nit is configured by default.\n\n1397\n01:19:46.750 --> 01:19:49.530\nSome OSes, some of the distros don't,\nbut most of them do.\n\n1398\n01:19:50.680 --> 01:19:58.070\nSo, I should have a logrotate.conf,\nand, there it is.\n\n1399\n01:19:58.070 --> 01:20:00.460\nAnd, so\nhere we can see it's set to rotate weekly.\n\n1400\n01:20:00.460 --> 01:20:04.340\nSo, log rotate's being called every day\nbut only once a week is it set to rotate.\n\n1401\n01:20:04.340 --> 01:20:08.310\nRotate four, that means we keep\nfour copies of my logs and so on.\n\n1402\n01:20:08.310 --> 01:20:10.860\nSo we can manipulate this log\nrotate to achieve what we want.\n\n1403\n01:20:10.860 --> 01:20:14.711\nBut that's an example right\nthere of a cron job, right?\n\n1404\n01:20:14.711 --> 01:20:19.586\nIt's just a script that performs some\naction and it will be called everyday or\n\n1405\n01:20:19.586 --> 01:20:21.918\nevery week or however often we want.\n\n1406\n01:20:21.918 --> 01:20:25.805\nNow you might ask yourself,\nif that was a weekly activity,\n\n1407\n01:20:25.805 --> 01:20:28.928\nwhy do they have it in the daily Cron job,\nokay?\n\n1408\n01:20:28.928 --> 01:20:33.866\nWell if you want to insure that it's every\nseven days, you can throw it in weekly\n\n1409\n01:20:33.866 --> 01:20:38.365\nyou can do a check just like they\ndid to say only do this once a week.\n\n1410\n01:20:38.365 --> 01:20:41.785\nSo that'll happen if it runs Monday,\nTuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday,\n\n1411\n01:20:41.785 --> 01:20:43.085\nSaturday, Sunday.\n\n1412\n01:20:43.085 --> 01:20:46.865\nIf it ran on Monday then Tuesday,\nWednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday,\n\n1413\n01:20:46.865 --> 01:20:48.990\nSunday it's gonna say it's already ran.\n\n1414\n01:20:48.990 --> 01:20:50.550\nAnd so it's not gonna do anything.\n\n1415\n01:20:50.550 --> 01:20:54.490\nAnd then on the next Monday it'll say\nthis is the first time, it hasn't run.\n\n1416\n01:20:54.490 --> 01:20:55.150\nLet me run it again.\n\n1417\n01:20:55.150 --> 01:20:56.560\nSo it's gonna run every Monday now.\n\n1418\n01:20:56.560 --> 01:20:58.110\nIt's gonna run every seven days.\n\n1419\n01:20:58.110 --> 01:21:03.030\nBut if I just threw it in weekly,\nthen it might run on Friday this week.\n\n1420\n01:21:03.030 --> 01:21:05.258\nAnd then it might run on Monday next week.\n\n1421\n01:21:05.258 --> 01:21:08.758\nAnd so now the difference between those\nlog files is only four days, right?\n\n1422\n01:21:08.758 --> 01:21:12.491\nBut if I want to ensure that it's seven\ndays then we could do it daily and\n\n1423\n01:21:12.491 --> 01:21:15.275\nin hard set there or\nyou can just use a true Cron job and\n\n1424\n01:21:15.275 --> 01:21:18.398\ndefine, always run it on Monday\nat this particular time.\n\n1425\n01:21:18.398 --> 01:21:21.981\nThe negative of doing it on a particular\ntime is if the system is offline,\n\n1426\n01:21:21.981 --> 01:21:25.389\nthe net time didn't happen that job\ndoesn't get run versus a daily or\n\n1427\n01:21:25.389 --> 01:21:29.840\nwhatever schedule where it will get\nrun at the earliest possible time.\n\n1428\n01:21:29.840 --> 01:21:32.441\nSo just keep that in mind\nlittle variations there,\n\n1429\n01:21:32.441 --> 01:21:34.748\nI think that's about all I've got for\nCron.\n\n1430\n01:21:34.748 --> 01:21:36.408\nDo I have anything else?\n\n1431\n01:21:36.408 --> 01:21:39.643\nYeah, we've got the cron.allow and\ncron.deny just like that and\n\n1432\n01:21:39.643 --> 01:21:41.380\nthat's really about it.\n\n1433\n01:21:41.380 --> 01:21:42.830\nIt's an incredibly useful system.\n\n1434\n01:21:42.830 --> 01:21:47.090\nIt's something that almost\nevery service relies upon.\n\n1435\n01:21:47.090 --> 01:21:51.562\nMy SQL, Post PIX they all have various\nhooks in the Cron to perform activities at\n\n1436\n01:21:51.562 --> 01:21:52.510\ncertain times.\n\n1437\n01:21:54.650 --> 01:22:00.540\nAll right, well the last thing we want to\ntalk about in this show is time right?\n\n1438\n01:22:00.540 --> 01:22:03.400\nIf we're using Cron to schedule\nthings at a certain time,\n\n1439\n01:22:03.400 --> 01:22:06.770\nwe probably need to make sure\nthe clock is right on our system and\n\n1440\n01:22:06.770 --> 01:22:08.630\nthere's a lot of things that\ncan get in the way of that.\n\n1441\n01:22:08.630 --> 01:22:11.537\nSo that's what we're gonna talk\nabout in the next segment, but for\n\n1442\n01:22:11.537 --> 01:22:13.478\nnow it's time for\nus to stop and take a break.\n\n1443\n01:22:13.478 --> 01:22:17.698\nSo let's do that, we'll pause and a take\na breather and when we get back, time.\n\n1444\n01:22:17.698 --> 01:22:19.578\nSo stay tuned, we'll be back after this.\n\n1445\n01:22:19.578 --> 01:22:27.431\n[SOUND]\nSo,\n\n1446\n01:22:27.431 --> 01:22:30.315\nfor our last segment,\nwe're going to be taking a look at time.\n\n1447\n01:22:30.315 --> 01:22:32.400\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> All right, for most users,\n\n1448\n01:22:32.400 --> 01:22:33.540\nwhen they install Linux,\n\n1449\n01:22:33.540 --> 01:22:37.020\nduring the installation it asks\nthem to pick the time zone.\n\n1450\n01:22:37.020 --> 01:22:37.570\n>> Yeah.\n\n1451\n01:22:37.570 --> 01:22:40.567\n>> And it asked a pretty important\nquestion about how your hardware clock is\n\n1452\n01:22:40.567 --> 01:22:44.040\nset up and it just moves on, and\nthat's the last we think about time.\n\n1453\n01:22:44.040 --> 01:22:46.880\nBut if you are gonna be using Cron jobs,\nif you are going to be scheduling\n\n1454\n01:22:46.880 --> 01:22:50.390\nthese to run at certain intervals,\nyour clock becomes really important and\n\n1455\n01:22:50.390 --> 01:22:54.330\nmaking sure you've got accurate time\non your system is important thing.\n\n1456\n01:22:54.330 --> 01:22:56.785\nAnd after that initial install,\nif you don't do a GUI,\n\n1457\n01:22:56.785 --> 01:23:00.181\nlike when you do a GUI install, you have\nthe clock up at the top of the screen and\n\n1458\n01:23:00.181 --> 01:23:02.548\nit's very easy to click on that and\nadjust your time.\n\n1459\n01:23:02.548 --> 01:23:04.629\nBut, if you don't do the GUI install,\n\n1460\n01:23:04.629 --> 01:23:07.858\nyou never really see the time\nagain except in your log files.\n\n1461\n01:23:07.858 --> 01:23:11.730\nSo we're gonna take a look at some of\nthe ways that we can manipulate that and\n\n1462\n01:23:11.730 --> 01:23:13.822\nlocalization in general, and in fact,\n\n1463\n01:23:13.822 --> 01:23:17.140\nlet me start off with just localization,\nright?\n\n1464\n01:23:17.140 --> 01:23:19.650\nDifferent countries,\nspeak different languages,\n\n1465\n01:23:19.650 --> 01:23:21.830\nhave different alphabets, right?\n\n1466\n01:23:21.830 --> 01:23:26.380\nSo we have different characters that are\nused, different filing coding that's used\n\n1467\n01:23:26.380 --> 01:23:30.010\nfrom location to location, different\ntime zones from location to location.\n\n1468\n01:23:30.010 --> 01:23:33.775\nThese are all things that are wrapped up\nunder one umbrella called localization,\n\n1469\n01:23:33.775 --> 01:23:34.610\nright?\n\n1470\n01:23:34.610 --> 01:23:37.610\nSo, when we talk about localizing\nan installation of Linux,\n\n1471\n01:23:37.610 --> 01:23:40.720\nwe're talking about configuring it for\nthe country that we're in,\n\n1472\n01:23:40.720 --> 01:23:43.620\nthe time that we're in for\nthe file types that we use.\n\n1473\n01:23:43.620 --> 01:23:45.318\nIt is a little bit of work there.\n\n1474\n01:23:45.318 --> 01:23:50.858\nIf you're moving from one to another,\nthere's some utilities that are designed\n\n1475\n01:23:50.858 --> 01:23:55.768\nto help that, utilities like\nthe converter, the iconverter, iconv.\n\n1476\n01:23:55.768 --> 01:24:01.366\nLet me show you this one, iconv,\nit's designed, it's a simple command\n\n1477\n01:24:01.366 --> 01:24:06.348\nthat's designed to convert a file\nfrom one encoding to another.\n\n1478\n01:24:06.348 --> 01:24:10.313\nSo, if you have a file that contains text\nwritten in the cyrillic alphabet and\n\n1479\n01:24:10.313 --> 01:24:13.241\nyou're gonna be using it on your system,\nwhich is set for\n\n1480\n01:24:13.241 --> 01:24:15.568\nUS English which just\nuses the normal Latin.\n\n1481\n01:24:15.568 --> 01:24:16.820\nI shouldn't call it normal.\n\n1482\n01:24:16.820 --> 01:24:19.780\nNormal for us, the Latin alphabet.\n\n1483\n01:24:19.780 --> 01:24:23.270\nThen we may need to convert that\nfile to be able to work with it.\n\n1484\n01:24:23.270 --> 01:24:27.482\nThere are many,\nmany encoding formats supported by Linux.\n\n1485\n01:24:27.482 --> 01:24:31.560\nAnd so it makes sense that we have\nutilities to convert between them.\n\n1486\n01:24:31.560 --> 01:24:35.667\nIn fact, if you run iconv-l or\n\n1487\n01:24:35.667 --> 01:24:40.110\n-- list it will give you a list of all the\nformats that are supported and you know,\n\n1488\n01:24:40.110 --> 01:24:43.950\nlet me try that again with a little\nmore prompt because I think, whoops.\n\n1489\n01:24:45.320 --> 01:24:46.170\nThere we go.\n\n1490\n01:24:46.170 --> 01:24:49.530\nI think what you'll see is\nthat there are many of them.\n\n1491\n01:24:49.530 --> 01:24:53.140\nMany of them that are numeric, so it's\njust got a numeric attached to them but\n\n1492\n01:24:53.140 --> 01:24:54.430\nothers have actual names.\n\n1493\n01:24:54.430 --> 01:25:00.250\nSo we've got like ANSI, ARABIC, ASCI and\nyou'll see other ones that are in there.\n\n1494\n01:25:00.250 --> 01:25:02.780\nEach of these pertain\nto different alphabets,\n\n1495\n01:25:02.780 --> 01:25:06.660\ndifferent ways of displaying characters,\ndifferent ways of arranging things.\n\n1496\n01:25:06.660 --> 01:25:09.370\nWhen you installed Linux\none of the questions it\n\n1497\n01:25:09.370 --> 01:25:11.290\nasked you was what country you were in.\n\n1498\n01:25:11.290 --> 01:25:17.180\nAnd when you picked it set your system up\nto use the default encoding, all right?\n\n1499\n01:25:17.180 --> 01:25:19.410\nAnd it's not something\nthat we can easily change,\n\n1500\n01:25:19.410 --> 01:25:22.040\nbecause our entire system\nhas been set up that way.\n\n1501\n01:25:22.040 --> 01:25:25.770\nSo if we're receiving files that\nare in some different encoding,\n\n1502\n01:25:25.770 --> 01:25:29.160\nit's easier to adapt them\nto what we've installed as.\n\n1503\n01:25:29.160 --> 01:25:32.881\nNow the most common one now is UTF-8, and\n\n1504\n01:25:32.881 --> 01:25:37.250\nUTF-8 is cool because it\nis they call it Unicode.\n\n1505\n01:25:37.250 --> 01:25:41.020\nAnd the idea is that it's one\nencoding that everybody can use.\n\n1506\n01:25:41.020 --> 01:25:43.730\nSo instead of having all these\ndifferent encodings that are out there,\n\n1507\n01:25:43.730 --> 01:25:48.500\njust hundreds of them,\nwe have one that everybody can share.\n\n1508\n01:25:48.500 --> 01:25:52.675\nAnd so you're seeing almost all Linux\ndistributions these days move to using\n\n1509\n01:25:52.675 --> 01:25:54.860\nUTF-8 and that's a good thing.\n\n1510\n01:25:54.860 --> 01:25:56.400\nWe want that, all right?\n\n1511\n01:25:56.400 --> 01:26:01.020\nBut you might still have files that\nwere written in ASCII, which is fine,\n\n1512\n01:26:01.020 --> 01:26:03.410\nbecause UTF-8 is backwards\ncompatible with ASCII.\n\n1513\n01:26:03.410 --> 01:26:07.300\nBut if it was written in ANSI,\nor in Latin one or\n\n1514\n01:26:07.300 --> 01:26:11.910\nsomething like that, then it's\nnot necessarily UTF-8 compatible.\n\n1515\n01:26:11.910 --> 01:26:14.370\nSo we can use iconv to convert it,\n\n1516\n01:26:14.370 --> 01:26:16.930\nto convert them over to\nthe format that we want.\n\n1517\n01:26:16.930 --> 01:26:18.058\nAnd there's a few ways to do it.\n\n1518\n01:26:18.058 --> 01:26:24.091\nIf you just want to convert the file\nthen you can just run iconv and\n\n1519\n01:26:24.091 --> 01:26:26.678\n-f and a file name, okay?\n\n1520\n01:26:26.678 --> 01:26:30.710\nBut you actually do have to specify what\nit's coming, sorry, -f is not a file name,\n\n1521\n01:26:30.710 --> 01:26:33.510\nit's what it's coming from and\nthen what it's going to and\n\n1522\n01:26:33.510 --> 01:26:35.440\nthen we specify the file name.\n\n1523\n01:26:35.440 --> 01:26:42.120\nSo the syntax would be the from\nwhat encoding it's at right now.\n\n1524\n01:26:42.120 --> 01:26:48.295\nSo maybe it's Latin 1 right now and\nI want to convert it to UTF-8.\n\n1525\n01:26:50.230 --> 01:26:51.950\nAnd then we specify the file name.\n\n1526\n01:26:51.950 --> 01:26:56.520\nSo the full syntax should be iconv-f and\nthe encoding\n\n1527\n01:26:56.520 --> 01:27:00.940\nthat it has now, then -t and\n\n1528\n01:27:00.940 --> 01:27:05.710\nthe encoding we're converting to followed\nby the file that we're converting.\n\n1529\n01:27:05.710 --> 01:27:09.380\nSo in my home directory\nI have file1.txt and\n\n1530\n01:27:09.380 --> 01:27:12.790\nif I were to run this it's gonna go in and\nconvert it.\n\n1531\n01:27:12.790 --> 01:27:16.350\nNow my file, that's it,\ninside of it just said this is my text.\n\n1532\n01:27:16.350 --> 01:27:19.030\nThere is more like it,\nbut this one is mine.\n\n1533\n01:27:19.030 --> 01:27:21.470\nSo there's the text it\ndisplays on the screen.\n\n1534\n01:27:21.470 --> 01:27:26.656\nNow, when it displays it on the screen,\nit's displaying it using\n\n1535\n01:27:26.656 --> 01:27:32.300\nUTF-8 not using LATIN 1 anymore,\nwhich is what that file was written in.\n\n1536\n01:27:32.300 --> 01:27:35.680\nSo we can manipulate that using iconv.\n\n1537\n01:27:35.680 --> 01:27:36.200\nIt's great for\n\n1538\n01:27:36.200 --> 01:27:39.638\nscripts, if you're running into scripts\nto convert files to bring them in.\n\n1539\n01:27:39.638 --> 01:27:43.341\nIf you wanna actually convert the file\nitself you can modify this command\n\n1540\n01:27:43.341 --> 01:27:44.078\na little bit.\n\n1541\n01:27:44.078 --> 01:27:51.328\nYou can say, for example,\nthat you want to do file1 as input and\n\n1542\n01:27:51.328 --> 01:27:58.390\nthen output your data into\nfile2.txt like that, right?\n\n1543\n01:27:58.390 --> 01:28:02.638\nMy head's gonna be on top of that,\nlet me move that up there.\n\n1544\n01:28:02.638 --> 01:28:08.076\nAll right, so we see right here\nICONV -from LATIN1 -t UTF-8,\n\n1545\n01:28:08.076 --> 01:28:11.582\nso I'm converting from Latin 1 UTF-8.\n\n1546\n01:28:11.582 --> 01:28:16.318\nMy input shown with the less\nthan symbol is file1.txt,\n\n1547\n01:28:16.318 --> 01:28:21.461\nmy output shown with the greater\nthan symbol is file2.txt.\n\n1548\n01:28:21.461 --> 01:28:26.318\nNow when I look, I've got file one,\nand I've got file two,\n\n1549\n01:28:26.318 --> 01:28:31.310\nand file one was done in latin one,\nfile two is now in.\n\n1550\n01:28:31.310 --> 01:28:34.910\nEasy to convert between them\nif we need too, all right?\n\n1551\n01:28:35.920 --> 01:28:38.420\nDuring the installation,\nyour encoding type is set, and\n\n1552\n01:28:38.420 --> 01:28:42.840\nit is actually possible with change\nthe encoding set, but it's not easy.\n\n1553\n01:28:42.840 --> 01:28:46.250\nIt's actually kind of a challenge, and so\nit's not something you normally wanna do.\n\n1554\n01:28:46.250 --> 01:28:48.440\nThat's why we have utilities, like iconv,\n\n1555\n01:28:48.440 --> 01:28:53.215\nthe converter, to be able to move\nbetween one format type and another.\n\n1556\n01:28:53.215 --> 01:28:53.819\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1557\n01:28:53.819 --> 01:28:57.810\n>> All right, so that's one of the things\nthat came as a result of picking our\n\n1558\n01:28:57.810 --> 01:29:00.870\ncountry and location during the install.\n\n1559\n01:29:00.870 --> 01:29:01.770\nThe other thing is our time.\n\n1560\n01:29:02.800 --> 01:29:06.590\nOnce we picked a country, it It gave\nus a range of timezones to pick and\n\n1561\n01:29:06.590 --> 01:29:10.570\nwe picked our timezone, and\nour time is being represented using that.\n\n1562\n01:29:10.570 --> 01:29:12.570\nAll right,\nif they wanna see the time on your system,\n\n1563\n01:29:12.570 --> 01:29:16.830\nyou can run the date command and it'll\nshow you your date along with the time,\n\n1564\n01:29:16.830 --> 01:29:18.950\nand so mine says that it's Wednesday,\nJune 25th.\n\n1565\n01:29:18.950 --> 01:29:23.880\nIt is 7:20AM,\nEastern Daylight time in 2014.\n\n1566\n01:29:23.880 --> 01:29:27.960\nOkay, well, Ronnie,\nyou know that's wrong, right?\n\n1567\n01:29:27.960 --> 01:29:32.435\n[LAUGH] So for us to be live and\non the air at 7:20 AM is pretty unlikely.\n\n1568\n01:29:32.435 --> 01:29:35.320\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Well, usually at least one or\n\n1569\n01:29:35.320 --> 01:29:36.390\ntwo of us are here.\n\n1570\n01:29:36.390 --> 01:29:37.110\n>> Yeah.\n>> But we're definitely\n\n1571\n01:29:37.110 --> 01:29:38.380\nnot live at that time.\n\n1572\n01:29:38.380 --> 01:29:42.090\nSo, the clock is wrong on my system and\nthe reason is,\n\n1573\n01:29:42.090 --> 01:29:45.170\nwhen I did the install,\nit asked me a question.\n\n1574\n01:29:45.170 --> 01:29:51.540\nIt said,\nis your hardware clock using TC or not.\n\n1575\n01:29:51.540 --> 01:29:56.950\nUTC is that universal time or Zulu time,\nGreenwich mean time, it's got\n\n1576\n01:29:56.950 --> 01:30:01.730\na bunch of different names, but basically\nit is the first time zone, right?\n\n1577\n01:30:01.730 --> 01:30:04.809\nThe time zone with an offset of zero,\nthat's what UTC is.\n\n1578\n01:30:06.420 --> 01:30:09.730\nA lot of people set their BIOS\nclocks to use UTC, and that's it and\n\n1579\n01:30:09.730 --> 01:30:14.340\nI assumed I did, this is VMware, so I just\nassumed it did, so I left that checked.\n\n1580\n01:30:14.340 --> 01:30:19.210\nBut it turns out that VMware is actually\nhanding off the time of my base system,\n\n1581\n01:30:19.210 --> 01:30:21.690\nwhich is in Eastern Daylight also.\n\n1582\n01:30:21.690 --> 01:30:27.690\nNow Eastern Daylight Time is UTC minus\nfour, and so I'm giving it UTC minus\n\n1583\n01:30:27.690 --> 01:30:32.800\nfour and then it's taking another minus\nfour off of it, making it minus eight.\n\n1584\n01:30:32.800 --> 01:30:36.390\nAnd that's why it's showing that it's\nseven A.M. when it actually isn't.\n\n1585\n01:30:36.390 --> 01:30:41.110\nSo I need to manipulate this and get it\nset up straight, kind of fix my time,\n\n1586\n01:30:41.110 --> 01:30:42.910\nmy time is wrong, okay.\n\n1587\n01:30:42.910 --> 01:30:47.320\nWell the date command is how we view our\ntime, it's also how we fix the time.\n\n1588\n01:30:47.320 --> 01:30:50.700\nIf you do a man date and\npull up that list,\n\n1589\n01:30:50.700 --> 01:30:54.540\nyou'll see where you can specify a date,\nyou can specify your time,\n\n1590\n01:30:54.540 --> 01:30:59.140\nyou can go through and\nmanipulate what the current values are.\n\n1591\n01:30:59.140 --> 01:31:04.380\nYou can also show what UTC is, that\nuniversal time, so you can pull that up.\n\n1592\n01:31:05.630 --> 01:31:09.515\nEach of the options are in there, so if we\nneed to manipulate time we've got that,\n\n1593\n01:31:09.515 --> 01:31:12.790\n-s is the one that we use to set it.\n\n1594\n01:31:12.790 --> 01:31:16.520\nSo, if I want to manually set my time,\nI can do that.\n\n1595\n01:31:16.520 --> 01:31:20.640\nI can come in here and I can say\ndate/s and then I can come through and\n\n1596\n01:31:20.640 --> 01:31:24.220\nI can specify the time, and\nthey give you some examples up there\n\n1597\n01:31:24.220 --> 01:31:28.735\nhow that can be formatted, but\nit actually sets several different forms.\n\n1598\n01:31:28.735 --> 01:31:34.284\nIt says 25th of June of 2014,\nand the time on the clock in\n\n1599\n01:31:34.284 --> 01:31:39.727\nour studio is 11:24 right now,\nso I can come through and\n\n1600\n01:31:39.727 --> 01:31:44.661\nspecify that,\nI think we actually to put it in quotes.\n\n1601\n01:31:44.661 --> 01:31:48.989\nI'm gonna try without quotes, I think\nwe do have to put it in quotes, yeah,\n\n1602\n01:31:48.989 --> 01:31:49.745\nI got angry.\n\n1603\n01:31:49.745 --> 01:31:53.947\nLet me stick that in quotes, there we go,\nand now it's gonna fix my time and\n\n1604\n01:31:53.947 --> 01:31:58.686\nput it in, and I can see that it's now\nWednesday June 25th at 11:24 AM Eastern\n\n1605\n01:31:58.686 --> 01:32:00.720\ndaylight time in 2014, okay?\n\n1606\n01:32:02.470 --> 01:32:06.040\nSo a dash s that'll fix it and\n\n1607\n01:32:06.040 --> 01:32:08.290\nwe're providing it as stream that's\nwhy I had to put it in quotes.\n\n1608\n01:32:10.700 --> 01:32:15.380\nAll right, so we can fix our time that\nway and now we're in business, right?\n\n1609\n01:32:15.380 --> 01:32:18.490\nThere's a few other things we may\nneed to be aware of though, so for\n\n1610\n01:32:18.490 --> 01:32:24.040\nexample, I said that my hardware clock,\nmy hardware clock is in my local timezone,\n\n1611\n01:32:24.040 --> 01:32:26.660\nmaybe I don't want that So\nI'm running out of VMware.\n\n1612\n01:32:26.660 --> 01:32:29.670\nSo I could go jump in to VMware fusion and\nfind the options in there and\n\n1613\n01:32:29.670 --> 01:32:35.820\nI could change it so that it is UTC\ninstead of Eastern Daylight or whatever.\n\n1614\n01:32:35.820 --> 01:32:39.570\nIf I do that,\nwhat's gonna happen to my virtual machine?\n\n1615\n01:32:39.570 --> 01:32:41.430\nNow my virtual machine is\ngonna be messed up again,\n\n1616\n01:32:41.430 --> 01:32:44.820\nI'm gonna have this wrong time cuz\nI changed the underlying system.\n\n1617\n01:32:44.820 --> 01:32:48.380\nSo we may need to interact with\nthe hardware clock on our system\n\n1618\n01:32:48.380 --> 01:32:50.100\nto be able to coordinate this.\n\n1619\n01:32:50.100 --> 01:32:55.960\nAnd so we've got the hwclock command that\nlets us interact with our hardware clock.\n\n1620\n01:32:55.960 --> 01:33:00.810\nSo I just ran hwclock, and\nlook at my time in the hardware system.\n\n1621\n01:33:00.810 --> 01:33:02.610\nIt's saying it's 7:24.\n\n1622\n01:33:02.610 --> 01:33:05.500\nWell, I'm GMT minus five.\n\n1623\n01:33:05.500 --> 01:33:12.520\nAnd so, you know, my UTC clock under the\nhood should be well five hours from now so\n\n1624\n01:33:12.520 --> 01:33:17.560\nit should be, like what would that be,\n\n1625\n01:33:17.560 --> 01:33:20.680\nI don't convert to military time,\nis it 1700 or something?\n\n1626\n01:33:20.680 --> 01:33:23.040\nOr no, it's plus five so it would be 1600.\n\n1627\n01:33:23.040 --> 01:33:25.760\nSo it should be 1624 which\nis not what it is But\n\n1628\n01:33:25.760 --> 01:33:30.230\nI can see my hardware clock is\nin Eastern Daylight Time, right?\n\n1629\n01:33:30.230 --> 01:33:34.970\nSo it is in that local time,\nso I may need to adjust that.\n\n1630\n01:33:34.970 --> 01:33:37.000\nHW clock can be adjusted\na few different ways,\n\n1631\n01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:41.800\nthe easiest is, once you fixed your time,\nyou can force it on the hardware clock\n\n1632\n01:33:41.800 --> 01:33:45.680\nMost of the time you do just need to boot\nup into your BIOS and fix it in there.\n\n1633\n01:33:45.680 --> 01:33:47.840\nBut there are some things\nthat we can do here.\n\n1634\n01:33:47.840 --> 01:33:53.770\nThe ones I like,\nyou've got hw clock dash dash sys to hc.\n\n1635\n01:33:54.860 --> 01:33:58.945\nThat takes Your system time and\nwrites it to the hardware clock.\n\n1636\n01:33:58.945 --> 01:33:59.555\nAlright?\nSo\n\n1637\n01:33:59.555 --> 01:34:02.635\nit forces the hardware clock\nto match whatever you got.\n\n1638\n01:34:02.635 --> 01:34:07.805\nYou can also reverse that around and\nsay hc to sys and that will\n\n1639\n01:34:07.805 --> 01:34:12.405\ntake the hardware clock and write it to\nyour system, so now they're in lock step.\n\n1640\n01:34:12.405 --> 01:34:16.900\nSo if I go and fix my hardware clock\nI can boot back up into Linux and\n\n1641\n01:34:16.900 --> 01:34:22.880\nI can just run this hwclock --hctosys and\nit will write that hardware clock.\n\n1642\n01:34:24.220 --> 01:34:27.640\nAnd when I run it,\nI can see I'm back to 7:25 AM and\n\n1643\n01:34:27.640 --> 01:34:30.320\nthat's because it wrote\nthe hardware clock to my system.\n\n1644\n01:34:30.320 --> 01:34:32.520\nRight?\nSo, if you are gonna go into your BIOS and\n\n1645\n01:34:32.520 --> 01:34:35.430\nfix it once it's done, you just run this.\n\n1646\n01:34:35.430 --> 01:34:37.300\nNow, I run it this way.\n\n1647\n01:34:37.300 --> 01:34:41.900\nI run hwclock -- hctosys,\ncuz that, I can remember that,\n\n1648\n01:34:41.900 --> 01:34:45.620\nhardware clock to system or the other\nway around, system to hardware clock.\n\n1649\n01:34:45.620 --> 01:34:48.840\nBut there are letter abbreviations\nyou can use for it, for\n\n1650\n01:34:48.840 --> 01:34:53.235\nexample we can say hwclock -w.\n\n1651\n01:34:53.235 --> 01:34:56.385\nThat takes our system clock and\nwrites it to the hardware clock.\n\n1652\n01:34:56.385 --> 01:34:57.105\n>> Mm.\n\n1653\n01:34:57.105 --> 01:35:01.025\n>> And then there's -s,\nthat takes the hardware clock and\n\n1654\n01:35:01.025 --> 01:35:03.545\nwrites it to our system.\n\n1655\n01:35:03.545 --> 01:35:04.875\nI can just never remember this-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1656\n01:35:04.875 --> 01:35:06.525\n>> I can never remember which is which,\n\n1657\n01:35:06.525 --> 01:35:08.130\nw and s, I don't know.\n\n1658\n01:35:08.130 --> 01:35:12.060\nSo that's why I use the longer name,\nbecause those are easy to remember.\n\n1659\n01:35:12.060 --> 01:35:15.790\nHC to SYS, it's pretty easy to\nremember what that one does.\n\n1660\n01:35:15.790 --> 01:35:17.350\nAll right, but there are variations.\n\n1661\n01:35:17.350 --> 01:35:22.890\nAnd if you ever forget, you can always\njust pull up the man page for HW clock And\n\n1662\n01:35:22.890 --> 01:35:28.750\nyou'll see them in there, it will have\ntheir /w =systohc, so it's right there.\n\n1663\n01:35:28.750 --> 01:35:35.930\nAll right, you can also adjust your\ntime zone, so you've got systz,\n\n1664\n01:35:35.930 --> 01:35:40.020\nset the kernel's timezone and reset\nthe time based on that current timezone.\n\n1665\n01:35:40.020 --> 01:35:43.300\nSo, if you want to change the timezone\nthat you're in, if you chose one that's\n\n1666\n01:35:43.300 --> 01:35:46.760\nincorrect, then you could pick\nthe proper time zone and fix that.\n\n1667\n01:35:46.760 --> 01:35:52.520\nThat's another one that is useful,\nand what else do we have?\n\n1668\n01:35:52.520 --> 01:35:56.000\nLet's see, day hw clock, we set our time,\n\n1669\n01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.742\nyou know, let me talk a little\nbit more about time zones.\n\n1670\n01:35:58.742 --> 01:36:02.160\nAll right, time zones unfortunately\n\n1671\n01:36:02.160 --> 01:36:06.020\nare one of those things that just\nvaries from distro to distro.\n\n1672\n01:36:06.020 --> 01:36:10.380\nThe time zones they have listed are not as\nstandardized as they really should be, and\n\n1673\n01:36:10.380 --> 01:36:12.880\nhow we set them can be different.\n\n1674\n01:36:12.880 --> 01:36:15.780\nSo, if you want to adjust\nthe time zone on your system,\n\n1675\n01:36:15.780 --> 01:36:18.376\nthere's a couple of places\nyou may need to look.\n\n1676\n01:36:18.376 --> 01:36:24.068\nIn /etc, there's a couple of files in\nhere that we need to to pay attention to.\n\n1677\n01:36:24.068 --> 01:36:27.050\nYou may have a file in\nhere called Timezone.\n\n1678\n01:36:29.740 --> 01:36:30.500\nI don't think I have one.\n\n1679\n01:36:30.500 --> 01:36:31.890\nYeah, I don't have one.\n\n1680\n01:36:31.890 --> 01:36:36.565\nSo in Red Hat, in Red Hat based OSs\nlike CentOS, we don't have this file,\n\n1681\n01:36:36.565 --> 01:36:38.500\n/etc/timezone, it's just not there.\n\n1682\n01:36:39.650 --> 01:36:43.306\nIn Red Hat systems, it's /etc/ localtime.\n\n1683\n01:36:45.188 --> 01:36:46.520\nThere we go.\n\n1684\n01:36:46.520 --> 01:36:48.770\nAnd I'll see this local time file.\n\n1685\n01:36:48.770 --> 01:36:51.880\nNow local time, is actually a binary,\nso I can't just look inside of it and\n\n1686\n01:36:51.880 --> 01:36:52.570\nsee things.\n\n1687\n01:36:52.570 --> 01:36:54.660\nIt's a jumbled mess, right?\n\n1688\n01:36:54.660 --> 01:36:59.280\nBut it is really a link, that's pointing\n\n1689\n01:36:59.280 --> 01:37:04.230\nto a file that specifies my time zone,\n/etc/timezone is kinda the same thing,\n\n1690\n01:37:04.230 --> 01:37:08.770\nand it's used mostly on\nDebian based OS like Ubuntu.\n\n1691\n01:37:08.770 --> 01:37:14.640\nSo Ubuntu, uses /etc/timezone\nwhereas Red Hat uses/etc/localtime.\n\n1692\n01:37:14.640 --> 01:37:17.860\nLittle variation there and I'll put it\nin the show notes so you've got it, but\n\n1693\n01:37:17.860 --> 01:37:19.890\nit makes it a little frustrating.\n\n1694\n01:37:19.890 --> 01:37:20.640\nFrustrating to me.\n\n1695\n01:37:20.640 --> 01:37:22.630\nI wish people would standardize on things.\n\n1696\n01:37:22.630 --> 01:37:23.840\nBut at the end of the day,\n\n1697\n01:37:23.840 --> 01:37:27.840\nthese are both usually just links\nthat point to our time zone file.\n\n1698\n01:37:27.840 --> 01:37:30.590\nAnd it's nice because if you ever wanna\nchange your time zone you just change\n\n1699\n01:37:30.590 --> 01:37:33.050\nthose links, and you're back in business.\n\n1700\n01:37:33.050 --> 01:37:37.270\nAnd where they're actually linking to\nis a folder tucked away on your driver.\n\n1701\n01:37:37.270 --> 01:37:41.309\nIf you browse in to /user or\n\n1702\n01:37:41.309 --> 01:37:47.650\n/usr/share/zoneinfo, all right?\n\n1703\n01:37:47.650 --> 01:37:52.315\nSo, that was /usr/share/zoneinfo.\n\n1704\n01:37:52.315 --> 01:37:54.835\nThat's were all of your\ntime zone info is stored.\n\n1705\n01:37:54.835 --> 01:37:56.355\nAnd that way when updates happen,\n\n1706\n01:37:56.355 --> 01:37:59.815\nif time zones change, governments\nchange the time zones all the time.\n\n1707\n01:37:59.815 --> 01:38:02.865\nIf that happens, you just download\nan update and it goes in to this folder.\n\n1708\n01:38:02.865 --> 01:38:08.120\nAnd when you look, you'll see a folder for\nthe various countries, or continents.\n\n1709\n01:38:08.120 --> 01:38:09.760\nIt's kind of broken up in different ways.\n\n1710\n01:38:09.760 --> 01:38:13.790\nSo, some of these that you look at\nare like Australia, it's a country and\n\n1711\n01:38:13.790 --> 01:38:15.100\na continent.\n\n1712\n01:38:15.100 --> 01:38:18.000\nBrazil, that's just a country,\nit's not a continent.\n\n1713\n01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:19.920\nAmerica, that's a continent, right?\n\n1714\n01:38:19.920 --> 01:38:22.410\nWell, actually, it's not, because you\nhave North America and South America.\n\n1715\n01:38:22.410 --> 01:38:24.430\nSo, this is generic America.\n\n1716\n01:38:24.430 --> 01:38:27.240\nIt goes back to the whole not\nreally following a standard.\n\n1717\n01:38:27.240 --> 01:38:33.480\nSo if I go into America, which is\nwhere we are, and we pull up a list,\n\n1718\n01:38:33.480 --> 01:38:39.320\nwe'll see selected major cities\nacross Canada, the United States,\n\n1719\n01:38:39.320 --> 01:38:42.840\nMexico, actually several other\ncountries are listed in here.\n\n1720\n01:38:42.840 --> 01:38:46.170\nSo just like random major cities,\nall right?\n\n1721\n01:38:46.170 --> 01:38:49.210\nThis is probably the most\nfrustrating way to set a time zone.\n\n1722\n01:38:49.210 --> 01:38:52.190\nAnd it's been like this in Linux since\nthe early days, really frustrating.\n\n1723\n01:38:52.190 --> 01:38:53.690\nBecause what you have to\ndo is you have to think,\n\n1724\n01:38:53.690 --> 01:38:57.690\nall right, what's the biggest\ncity in my timezone, right?\n\n1725\n01:38:57.690 --> 01:39:01.490\nNot what timezone am I in, I know I'm in\nthe eastern time zone, well big deal.\n\n1726\n01:39:01.490 --> 01:39:06.010\nYou've gotta come in here and find a city\nthat's in the same time zone as you so,\n\n1727\n01:39:06.010 --> 01:39:09.850\nthe biggest city in our time\nzone is probably New York.\n\n1728\n01:39:09.850 --> 01:39:12.190\nAtlanta's pretty big, New York is bigger.\n\n1729\n01:39:12.190 --> 01:39:14.420\nI think Atlanta is not even in the list.\n\n1730\n01:39:14.420 --> 01:39:16.390\nYeah, it's not, but New York is.\n\n1731\n01:39:16.390 --> 01:39:20.180\nSo, I can go through here and I can\nfind New York, right there, New York.\n\n1732\n01:39:20.180 --> 01:39:24.470\nSo there's a file in here for\nNew York, that defines its time zone.\n\n1733\n01:39:24.470 --> 01:39:29.220\nAnd I can link that file\nto my local time and\n\n1734\n01:39:29.220 --> 01:39:33.230\nnow the system will know that that's the\ntimezone that I'm operating in, all right?\n\n1735\n01:39:33.230 --> 01:39:36.700\nAnd the way we do that is by doing this,\n\n1736\n01:39:36.700 --> 01:39:41.870\nwe can do a symbolic link,\nall right, a symbolic file link.\n\n1737\n01:39:41.870 --> 01:39:51.591\nAnd I'm gonna do a symbolic link to\n/usr/share/zoneinfo/America/New_York and\n\n1738\n01:39:51.591 --> 01:39:57.204\nI'm gonna link that to /etc/localtime.\n\n1739\n01:39:58.220 --> 01:39:59.930\nOkay, so, there's where I'm gonna link it.\n\n1740\n01:39:59.930 --> 01:40:04.620\nI'm gonna specify it there and\nnow it's linked together, all right?\n\n1741\n01:40:04.620 --> 01:40:07.800\nIf that time zone ever changes.\n\n1742\n01:40:07.800 --> 01:40:10.870\nIt's behavior for daylight savings or\nwhatever that changes.\n\n1743\n01:40:10.870 --> 01:40:13.340\nUpdates will come down and\napply to that file.\n\n1744\n01:40:13.340 --> 01:40:16.800\nAnd since I'm just linking to it,\nthat means I'm updated too and\n\n1745\n01:40:16.800 --> 01:40:18.270\nin good shape, all right?\n\n1746\n01:40:18.270 --> 01:40:21.896\nSo on a Red Hat based system,\nthat's how we set the timezone.\n\n1747\n01:40:21.896 --> 01:40:23.971\nAll right.\nOn a Debian or Ubuntu system,\n\n1748\n01:40:23.971 --> 01:40:26.730\nwe would just edit that timezone file.\n\n1749\n01:40:26.730 --> 01:40:30.100\nYou would use vi or\nwhatever to /etc/timezone.\n\n1750\n01:40:30.100 --> 01:40:35.183\nAnd you would just punch in there,\nAmerica/New_York.\n\n1751\n01:40:35.183 --> 01:40:37.950\nAnd that is what would tell\nit to use that timezone.\n\n1752\n01:40:39.600 --> 01:40:43.190\nAll right, so, that's basically what\nyou would do on one of those system.\n\n1753\n01:40:43.190 --> 01:40:47.160\nSo, slight variations not standardized,\nkind of frustrating.\n\n1754\n01:40:47.160 --> 01:40:49.320\nDuring the install, if you pick\nthe right one you never worry about it.\n\n1755\n01:40:49.320 --> 01:40:50.620\nYou don't care how it's done.\n\n1756\n01:40:50.620 --> 01:40:54.070\nBut if it is, something that\nyou need to change afterwards.\n\n1757\n01:40:54.070 --> 01:40:56.675\nMaybe this is you personal desktop and\nyou moved.\n\n1758\n01:40:56.675 --> 01:41:01.900\nI moved to Seattle for a while and\nI was in Florida on the Eastern time zone.\n\n1759\n01:41:01.900 --> 01:41:03.590\nMoved to Seattle,\nI was in the Pacific time zone.\n\n1760\n01:41:03.590 --> 01:41:04.530\nSo you have to change everything,\n\n1761\n01:41:04.530 --> 01:41:07.040\nyou have to update that system\nto reflect the time zone.\n\n1762\n01:41:07.040 --> 01:41:10.370\nIf you're in a GUI, you just click on\nyour clock, and you knock it out, right?\n\n1763\n01:41:10.370 --> 01:41:14.740\nBut from the command line, I would just go\nand I would link the Pacific time zones.\n\n1764\n01:41:14.740 --> 01:41:17.270\nSo, I would need to find a major city,\n\n1765\n01:41:17.270 --> 01:41:19.040\nwhich I don't think\nSeattle is in the list.\n\n1766\n01:41:20.870 --> 01:41:25.170\nLet's just go in here and look and see and\nSeattle is probably not on the list so\n\n1767\n01:41:25.170 --> 01:41:28.350\nthe biggest one on the western\ncoast is probably Los Angeles.\n\n1768\n01:41:28.350 --> 01:41:31.080\n>> Yeah.\n>> Which I'm pretty sure is in here.\n\n1769\n01:41:31.080 --> 01:41:32.640\nSo, there's Los Angeles, yep.\n\n1770\n01:41:32.640 --> 01:41:36.360\nSo, instead of linking\nto America/New_York,\n\n1771\n01:41:36.360 --> 01:41:42.540\nI would just link to America/Los_ Angeles,\nLos Angeles or however we wanna say that.\n\n1772\n01:41:42.540 --> 01:41:43.810\nSo I would launch that, and\n\n1773\n01:41:43.810 --> 01:41:46.780\nnow my system will know that that's\nthe time zone that we're gonna operate in.\n\n1774\n01:41:46.780 --> 01:41:49.540\nNow, it may not take affect right away.\n\n1775\n01:41:49.540 --> 01:41:53.970\nIt did, all right sometimes it takes\na moment because it's a timer function.\n\n1776\n01:41:53.970 --> 01:41:57.340\nBut I can see mine already shows me\nin pacific daylight time now and\n\n1777\n01:41:57.340 --> 01:41:59.120\nhas rolled me back three hours.\n\n1778\n01:41:59.120 --> 01:42:01.118\nRight, so I'm GMT minus five here,\n\n1779\n01:42:01.118 --> 01:42:04.222\nI guess during daylight\nsavings time we're minus four?\n\n1780\n01:42:04.222 --> 01:42:07.827\nBut then those guys over there, are minus\neight, or during daylight savings time\n\n1781\n01:42:07.827 --> 01:42:11.660\nthey're minus seven, so it's already kinda\nfigured that out and adjusted the time.\n\n1782\n01:42:12.790 --> 01:42:16.820\nSo, that's how we change that\ntime zone on a Red Hat system.\n\n1783\n01:42:16.820 --> 01:42:18.520\n>> Yeah.\n>> A little easier on the Ubuntu side.\n\n1784\n01:42:20.320 --> 01:42:25.280\nAll right, now, when we set our time,\nI manually set it a moment ago, right.\n\n1785\n01:42:25.280 --> 01:42:28.390\nIf I go back into my history and\nI find where I set that date.\n\n1786\n01:42:29.580 --> 01:42:30.350\nRight there.\n\n1787\n01:42:30.350 --> 01:42:34.050\nSo I manually set my time to 11:24,\ncuz I looked at this clock over here and\n\n1788\n01:42:34.050 --> 01:42:35.940\nthat's what it said, all right.\n\n1789\n01:42:35.940 --> 01:42:38.950\nWell if I look at that clock right now,\nit's actually 11:35 now so,\n\n1790\n01:42:38.950 --> 01:42:41.650\nI can bump that up, and\nthere we go, right.\n\n1791\n01:42:41.650 --> 01:42:42.820\nHere's the problem.\n\n1792\n01:42:42.820 --> 01:42:45.700\nI actually need to put my time\nzone back before we go to far.\n\n1793\n01:42:45.700 --> 01:42:48.500\nAnd then I'll set my time.\n\n1794\n01:42:48.500 --> 01:42:52.134\nHere's the problem, when I set that time,\nnotice what it did to the seconds.\n\n1795\n01:42:52.134 --> 01:42:55.300\nIt's 11:35 sure, and zero seconds.\n\n1796\n01:42:55.300 --> 01:42:57.760\nNow I looked at that clock over there and\nit doesn't have seconds on it.\n\n1797\n01:42:57.760 --> 01:43:00.910\nAnd on that clock it's already 11:36 but\nwhen I look here,\n\n1798\n01:43:00.910 --> 01:43:03.080\nI'm still at 11:35, okay.\n\n1799\n01:43:03.080 --> 01:43:06.770\nSo my seconds are off, this is not\nthe most accurate way to do things.\n\n1800\n01:43:06.770 --> 01:43:11.020\nWhen you set the clock by hand,\nyou run the risk of little inaccuracies.\n\n1801\n01:43:11.020 --> 01:43:14.850\nNow it's not such a big deal to be\noff by a minute or whatever, right.\n\n1802\n01:43:14.850 --> 01:43:18.850\nBut, when you're trying to correlate\nlog files between multiple servers to\n\n1803\n01:43:18.850 --> 01:43:22.780\ntrack a security incident,\nyou need time to be precise.\n\n1804\n01:43:22.780 --> 01:43:25.420\nAnd if you're doing things\nlike Kerberos authentication.\n\n1805\n01:43:25.420 --> 01:43:28.440\nKerberos, if the clocks are too far off,\nwill fail to authenticate.\n\n1806\n01:43:28.440 --> 01:43:31.750\nIt'll assume that there's a man\nin the middle attack going on.\n\n1807\n01:43:31.750 --> 01:43:37.570\nSo in the security world, we wanna have\nthe most accurate clocks possible.\n\n1808\n01:43:37.570 --> 01:43:41.760\nSo to facilitate that, most distros\nuse the Network Time Protocol,\n\n1809\n01:43:41.760 --> 01:43:45.120\nor NTP, to reach out on the Internet and\n\n1810\n01:43:45.120 --> 01:43:47.860\nget their time from an internet\ntime source, all right.\n\n1811\n01:43:47.860 --> 01:43:50.270\nIt's actually, surprisingly easy to setup.\n\n1812\n01:43:50.270 --> 01:43:52.570\nMost installs already have it.\n\n1813\n01:43:52.570 --> 01:43:56.540\nYou can just do like a yum list ntp and\n\n1814\n01:43:56.540 --> 01:43:59.530\nyou'll probably see that the ntp\npackages are already installed.\n\n1815\n01:43:59.530 --> 01:44:02.020\nSo, I can see on my install\npackage it's already there.\n\n1816\n01:44:02.020 --> 01:44:06.367\nIf it wasn't, I could install it really\nquickly with a yum install ntp and\n\n1817\n01:44:06.367 --> 01:44:07.221\nknock it out.\n\n1818\n01:44:07.221 --> 01:44:10.753\nBut, so I already got it It's just\na matter of getting in there and\n\n1819\n01:44:10.753 --> 01:44:13.014\nconfiguring it and setting it up to work.\n\n1820\n01:44:13.014 --> 01:44:17.043\nNow Red Hat and CentOS,\nwhen they ship their operating system,\n\n1821\n01:44:17.043 --> 01:44:20.338\nthey actually ship it\nconfigured with NTP servers.\n\n1822\n01:44:20.338 --> 01:44:23.317\nFor you so\nthere's already some that are in there.\n\n1823\n01:44:23.317 --> 01:44:28.374\nWe can see that if we\nedit the configuration,\n\n1824\n01:44:28.374 --> 01:44:34.570\n/etc/ntp.conf, I'm trying to remember.\n\n1825\n01:44:34.570 --> 01:44:39.023\nYes, and so if you look in here,\nit's got all sorts of information about\n\n1826\n01:44:39.023 --> 01:44:42.899\nif we're gonna be an NTP server\nwho is allowed to connect to us.\n\n1827\n01:44:42.899 --> 01:44:45.557\nAnd it's also got servers\nlisted down here.\n\n1828\n01:44:45.557 --> 01:44:52.245\nAnd see how I've got server 0, 1,\n2 and 3 for centos.pool.ntp.org, okay?\n\n1829\n01:44:52.245 --> 01:44:56.060\nThese are, well,\nit looks like four servers.\n\n1830\n01:44:56.060 --> 01:44:58.520\nThese are actually probably pointing to,\nwell,\n\n1831\n01:44:58.520 --> 01:45:00.880\nthese probably are pointing\nto four actual servers.\n\n1832\n01:45:00.880 --> 01:45:05.850\nA lot of times these names will point\nto a pool of IPs, a complete range\n\n1833\n01:45:05.850 --> 01:45:09.820\nof maybe even hundreds of servers that\nyou can synchronize your time against.\n\n1834\n01:45:09.820 --> 01:45:15.390\nBut these are all pointing out to\npublic time servers hosted on ntp.org.\n\n1835\n01:45:15.390 --> 01:45:18.301\nIf you're not familiar with them, ntp.org,\n\n1836\n01:45:18.301 --> 01:45:22.826\nit's a non-profit organization and\nthey provide public time servers.\n\n1837\n01:45:22.826 --> 01:45:25.130\nTime servers that anybody\ncan synchronize off of.\n\n1838\n01:45:25.130 --> 01:45:29.702\nAnd when you point your system to them,\nyou're not just pulling from one server,\n\n1839\n01:45:29.702 --> 01:45:33.362\nyou're pointing to hundreds of\nservers that are in their pools.\n\n1840\n01:45:33.362 --> 01:45:35.172\nAnd you can go really generic.\n\n1841\n01:45:35.172 --> 01:45:39.365\nAnd you can go point to pool.ntp.org and\nwhen you point to that,\n\n1842\n01:45:39.365 --> 01:45:43.785\nthat's going to be hitting,\nwell I got sent to one of their mirrors,\n\n1843\n01:45:43.785 --> 01:45:48.532\nbut that's gonna be hitting a range of\nsystems if we, let me go back here.\n\n1844\n01:45:48.532 --> 01:45:54.661\nI'll do like a nslookup pool.ntp.org,\nall right?\n\n1845\n01:45:54.661 --> 01:45:56.924\nSee how I got more than\none IP address back?\n\n1846\n01:45:56.924 --> 01:46:00.056\nAnd each of those IPs might be pointing\nto load balancers in multiple servers, or\n\n1847\n01:46:00.056 --> 01:46:01.761\nit might be pointing to a single server,\nbut\n\n1848\n01:46:01.761 --> 01:46:05.180\nbasically it's saying here's four\ndifferent servers you can pick from.\n\n1849\n01:46:05.180 --> 01:46:08.736\nJump right in there and have at it, right?\n\n1850\n01:46:08.736 --> 01:46:11.020\nAnd if you can't reach one,\njust move to the next one, right?\n\n1851\n01:46:11.020 --> 01:46:13.422\nHere's public time servers I can use.\n\n1852\n01:46:13.422 --> 01:46:16.873\nAnd they have all sorts of\naliases attached to it so\n\n1853\n01:46:16.873 --> 01:46:19.430\nthat you can get different servers.\n\n1854\n01:46:19.430 --> 01:46:24.220\nSo there's 0 and there's 1 and\nsee how I got different IPs?\n\n1855\n01:46:24.220 --> 01:46:28.760\nSo if I wanted to do completely separate\npools, here's one pool of time servers,\n\n1856\n01:46:28.760 --> 01:46:32.170\nhere's another pool,\nI think it goes all the way to 4.\n\n1857\n01:46:32.170 --> 01:46:36.500\nI can pull up 2 and 3 and 4,\nI won't bore us by going too far.\n\n1858\n01:46:36.500 --> 01:46:39.321\nBut see how it's grabbing\ndifferent IPs for each one,\n\n1859\n01:46:39.321 --> 01:46:42.949\nthese are different pools of servers\nthat are available for me to use.\n\n1860\n01:46:42.949 --> 01:46:47.602\nNow the further away the server is, the\nmore delay there is in getting your data.\n\n1861\n01:46:47.602 --> 01:46:50.122\nNTP accounts for that,\nIt actually does adjustments.\n\n1862\n01:46:50.122 --> 01:46:53.070\nBut you might wanna find ones that\nare geographically close to you.\n\n1863\n01:46:53.070 --> 01:46:56.393\nAnd so ntp.org has just a ton\nof pools that are out there\n\n1864\n01:46:56.393 --> 01:46:59.574\nyou can use that are even\ngeographically close, and\n\n1865\n01:46:59.574 --> 01:47:03.200\nlet me see if I can find the link\nin here where they list them.\n\n1866\n01:47:03.200 --> 01:47:06.822\nSo, if I wanna go into North America,\nhere we go.\n\n1867\n01:47:06.822 --> 01:47:10.565\nSo I can do 0.north-america.pool.ntp.org,\nand\n\n1868\n01:47:10.565 --> 01:47:15.208\nnow I'll just get servers that\nare close to me geographically.\n\n1869\n01:47:15.208 --> 01:47:18.590\nSo everybody has,\ndifferent countries have that, here's US,\n\n1870\n01:47:18.590 --> 01:47:20.540\nmaybe I don't want Canadian Servers,\nright?\n\n1871\n01:47:20.540 --> 01:47:24.360\nCuz, again, Florida, we're about as\nfar from Canada as you can get in\n\n1872\n01:47:24.360 --> 01:47:27.320\nthe United States so\nmaybe I wanna find ones that are closer.\n\n1873\n01:47:27.320 --> 01:47:31.591\nSo, I can say us.pool.ntp.org.\n\n1874\n01:47:31.591 --> 01:47:34.193\nSo these are all public,\nthey're freely available.\n\n1875\n01:47:34.193 --> 01:47:35.410\nAnybody can use them.\n\n1876\n01:47:35.410 --> 01:47:37.894\nAnd the CentOS guys have\nteamed up with them.\n\n1877\n01:47:37.894 --> 01:47:42.967\nAnd so that's what I'm seeing in\nthat file, in the configuration\n\n1878\n01:47:42.967 --> 01:47:48.144\nwhere they've got 0, 1,\n2 and 3.centos.pool.ntp.org.\n\n1879\n01:47:48.144 --> 01:47:48.976\nAnd so that's so\n\n1880\n01:47:48.976 --> 01:47:53.150\nthey can show that it's their systems\nthat are providing to ntp.org, all right?\n\n1881\n01:47:53.150 --> 01:47:55.530\nThis is a pretty common system,\na lot of people use it.\n\n1882\n01:47:55.530 --> 01:47:58.180\nYou don't have to use it though,\nmaybe you don't trust them.\n\n1883\n01:47:58.180 --> 01:48:01.270\nSomebody could perform an attack on\nntp.org and you don't want that, right?\n\n1884\n01:48:01.270 --> 01:48:04.740\nOr you don't really know who is running\nthis servers so you might want your own.\n\n1885\n01:48:04.740 --> 01:48:07.970\nYou can buy appliances that let\nyou build your own time servers.\n\n1886\n01:48:07.970 --> 01:48:12.120\nYou can get appliances that will\nsynchronize off of the radio clock,\n\n1887\n01:48:12.120 --> 01:48:15.440\nthe universal clock that's\nbroadcast over most countries.\n\n1888\n01:48:15.440 --> 01:48:17.830\nAnd that way you get your own time source,\nand\n\n1889\n01:48:17.830 --> 01:48:22.830\nthen you make your own NTP server,\nany Linux box can be an NTP server.\n\n1890\n01:48:22.830 --> 01:48:26.712\nIf you've got NTP installed,\nthen you have NTPD,\n\n1891\n01:48:26.712 --> 01:48:31.610\nwhich is the NTP daemon,\nand you can fire it up.\n\n1892\n01:48:31.610 --> 01:48:36.550\nIn fact, it might even be,\nlet's see if it's running on mine.\n\n1893\n01:48:36.550 --> 01:48:38.141\nWhoop, I should have filtered that.\n\n1894\n01:48:38.141 --> 01:48:39.520\nWell, no, I can see it right there.\n\n1895\n01:48:39.520 --> 01:48:43.630\nSo I ran service -- status-all.\n\n1896\n01:48:43.630 --> 01:48:47.480\nIt lists all the services that are running\nin the background and their status and so\n\n1897\n01:48:47.480 --> 01:48:52.520\nI can see on my system,\nI have NTPD I could be an NTP server but\n\n1898\n01:48:52.520 --> 01:48:54.110\nit stopped, I just haven't configured it.\n\n1899\n01:48:54.110 --> 01:48:57.820\nSo, you can turn any server\ninto an NTP server if you want.\n\n1900\n01:49:00.010 --> 01:49:04.200\nAll right, but for right now, for\nthis exam, we're just worried about being\n\n1901\n01:49:04.200 --> 01:49:07.380\na client, worried about getting a time and\nsynchronizing it.\n\n1902\n01:49:07.380 --> 01:49:13.058\nSo if I wanna do that, I can edit\nthe /etc/ntp.com file and I can add in\n\n1903\n01:49:13.058 --> 01:49:18.849\nmy own servers, or if I'm happy with\nthose, I can just stick with them.\n\n1904\n01:49:18.849 --> 01:49:21.239\nI can kind of go about\nthat however I want.\n\n1905\n01:49:21.239 --> 01:49:28.761\nI'm gonna go in here and\nI'm gonna add server 0.us.pool.ntp.org,\n\n1906\n01:49:28.761 --> 01:49:35.931\nall right, that way I get the NTP\nserver that is for the United States.\n\n1907\n01:49:35.931 --> 01:49:38.523\nWe're gonna be one,\nI don't know which one, but\n\n1908\n01:49:38.523 --> 01:49:40.827\nit's gonna be one pulled from around here.\n\n1909\n01:49:40.827 --> 01:49:46.401\nAll right, and I don't remember what\nthe iburst tag on that one does.\n\n1910\n01:49:46.401 --> 01:49:49.845\nIt probably has to deal with how\nwe send those communications out.\n\n1911\n01:49:49.845 --> 01:49:53.610\nCuz time synchronization can be\na very bursty type thing, we send\n\n1912\n01:49:53.610 --> 01:49:58.350\na burst of traffic and we expect as low\na latency response as possible back.\n\n1913\n01:49:58.350 --> 01:50:00.440\nAnd we communicate,\nit's actually more than one thing.\n\n1914\n01:50:00.440 --> 01:50:05.060\nIt sends out a test first to measure\nthe time difference between the packet\n\n1915\n01:50:05.060 --> 01:50:08.500\nleaving you, getting to the other side,\nand coming back, so\n\n1916\n01:50:08.500 --> 01:50:11.180\nthat it can adjust the time\nit gets based on the delay.\n\n1917\n01:50:11.180 --> 01:50:12.750\nSo we're as precise as possible.\n\n1918\n01:50:12.750 --> 01:50:14.260\nSo it may have something to do with that.\n\n1919\n01:50:14.260 --> 01:50:18.468\nI'll just leave it off,\ncuz I don't remember what it does, whoops.\n\n1920\n01:50:18.468 --> 01:50:21.350\nAnd I'm gonna leave in some extra\ntext that will screw things up.\n\n1921\n01:50:21.350 --> 01:50:22.860\nThere we go, all right.\n\n1922\n01:50:22.860 --> 01:50:25.328\nSo now when NTP synchronizes next,\n\n1923\n01:50:25.328 --> 01:50:29.283\nit'll reach out to these servers and\nget the right time.\n\n1924\n01:50:29.283 --> 01:50:32.190\nAnd I'm in my right time zone so\neverything should be good.\n\n1925\n01:50:32.190 --> 01:50:36.110\nYou can schedule this to run on your\nown using a Cron job if you want or\n\n1926\n01:50:36.110 --> 01:50:39.200\nyou can manually kick it\noff to have it synchronize.\n\n1927\n01:50:39.200 --> 01:50:41.970\nSo if I wanna force it, I can say ntpdate.\n\n1928\n01:50:44.600 --> 01:50:53.060\nAnd then let's do 0.us.pool.ntp.org, okay?\n\n1929\n01:50:53.060 --> 01:50:56.850\nSo NTP date, we have the date\ncommand where we can set the time.\n\n1930\n01:50:56.850 --> 01:51:00.130\nNTP date says use NTP to set the date.\n\n1931\n01:51:00.130 --> 01:51:05.000\nAnd so I can run that, it'll reach out to\nthat server and get the time and set it.\n\n1932\n01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:07.727\nAnd it's setting it very, very precise.\n\n1933\n01:51:07.727 --> 01:51:10.664\nSee that offset -37, whatever?\n\n1934\n01:51:10.664 --> 01:51:14.318\nThat's it measuring the amount of time it\ntook my packet to get there and back, so\n\n1935\n01:51:14.318 --> 01:51:16.486\napparently 37 milliseconds and something.\n\n1936\n01:51:16.486 --> 01:51:21.920\nSo it offset that and corrected so\nthat my time would be entered in properly.\n\n1937\n01:51:21.920 --> 01:51:25.488\nOr actually I think it's telling me\nthere that I'm 37 seconds off, and so\n\n1938\n01:51:25.488 --> 01:51:26.392\nit's fixed that.\n\n1939\n01:51:26.392 --> 01:51:27.893\nBut I can see that it's set.\n\n1940\n01:51:27.893 --> 01:51:31.401\nAnd when I look at my time now,\nit's very precise.\n\n1941\n01:51:31.401 --> 01:51:36.613\n11:43 and 2 seconds, cuz that's\nwhat it got from the other side.\n\n1942\n01:51:36.613 --> 01:51:40.015\nAll right, so\nNTP is a great way to handle that.\n\n1943\n01:51:40.015 --> 01:51:45.658\nIf we wanna create a Cron job to do\nthe NTP updates at a particular interval,\n\n1944\n01:51:45.658 --> 01:51:47.637\nthat's pretty easy too.\n\n1945\n01:51:47.637 --> 01:51:54.414\nSo we can just edit our crontab like we\nsaw at the beginning of this episode, and\n\n1946\n01:51:54.414 --> 01:52:00.388\nI'm just gonna add an entry in here and\nmaybe I wanna update my clock.\n\n1947\n01:52:00.388 --> 01:52:04.182\nIt depends on how sensitive your operation\nis, let's say once a day, right?\n\n1948\n01:52:04.182 --> 01:52:06.486\nSo, everyday at midnight,\n\n1949\n01:52:06.486 --> 01:52:11.192\neveryday at midnight I wanna go ahead and\nupdate my clock.\n\n1950\n01:52:11.192 --> 01:52:13.917\nSo, I'm gonna set the minute and\nthe hour to 0.\n\n1951\n01:52:13.917 --> 01:52:16.563\nSo, at the very beginning of the day,\n\n1952\n01:52:16.563 --> 01:52:20.384\n0 hundred hours everyday of the month,\nevery month.\n\n1953\n01:52:20.384 --> 01:52:25.782\nEvery day of the week as root I\nwant to perform an action and\n\n1954\n01:52:25.782 --> 01:52:30.729\nmy action is gonna be slash\nUSR slash bin slash NTPD so\n\n1955\n01:52:30.729 --> 01:52:33.557\nI'm gonna fire up the demon.\n\n1956\n01:52:33.557 --> 01:52:39.997\nI'm gonna tell it to run one time,\ndash q and for\n\n1957\n01:52:39.997 --> 01:52:45.825\nthe user I'm going to use the ntp process.\n\n1958\n01:52:45.825 --> 01:52:50.470\nNtpd-q says to run once,\nsynchronize the time and exit.\n\n1959\n01:52:50.470 --> 01:52:54.760\nIt's effectively the same as ntp date,\nthe command I showed you a moment ago.\n\n1960\n01:52:54.760 --> 01:52:55.420\nAll right?\n\n1961\n01:52:55.420 --> 01:52:57.440\nSo why have two commands?\n\n1962\n01:52:57.440 --> 01:52:59.895\nWell ntpdate is the old command.\n\n1963\n01:52:59.895 --> 01:53:02.990\nNtpd-q is the new one.\n\n1964\n01:53:02.990 --> 01:53:07.290\nSo one of these days\nntpdate is gonna go away,\n\n1965\n01:53:07.290 --> 01:53:11.310\nwe're not gonna have that command anymore,\nbut for now we have both.\n\n1966\n01:53:11.310 --> 01:53:15.930\nAnd so they are effectively the same, I\ncould use ntpdate thing is, I'll probably\n\n1967\n01:53:15.930 --> 01:53:20.570\nforget about this cron job, and five\nyears from now when ntpdate goes away,\n\n1968\n01:53:20.570 --> 01:53:21.860\nI won't remember to come in here and\nchange it.\n\n1969\n01:53:21.860 --> 01:53:22.670\nSo I'm just going ahead and\n\n1970\n01:53:22.670 --> 01:53:26.940\nusing the new command here to\nmake sure I'm on the safe side.\n\n1971\n01:53:26.940 --> 01:53:31.360\nSo ntpd -q Is the same thing as ntpdate,\nthey do the same thing.\n\n1972\n01:53:31.360 --> 01:53:34.060\nAnd then -u,\nI'm just saying run this as the ntp user.\n\n1973\n01:53:34.060 --> 01:53:36.690\nIt's a service, ntpd is a daemon.\n\n1974\n01:53:36.690 --> 01:53:40.076\nAnd so I need to start it as\na particular user, I'm firing up an ntp.\n\n1975\n01:53:40.076 --> 01:53:44.530\nSo this will make it work every single day\nat midnight, I'll synchronize my clock.\n\n1976\n01:53:44.530 --> 01:53:47.090\nIf I'm off by five seconds, it'll fix it.\n\n1977\n01:53:47.090 --> 01:53:50.672\nIf I'm off by one second, it'll fix it,\nIf I'm off by ten minutes, it'll fix it,\n\n1978\n01:53:50.672 --> 01:53:51.686\neveryday at midnight.\n\n1979\n01:53:54.936 --> 01:53:57.370\nAll right.\nI'll go ahead and save that.\n\n1980\n01:53:57.370 --> 01:53:57.889\nNow I'm in business.\n\n1981\n01:54:00.380 --> 01:54:04.240\nAll right, so when it comes to\nour timezone, our localization,\n\n1982\n01:54:04.240 --> 01:54:07.750\nour clocks, these are things that most of\nus don't think about because if you set\n\n1983\n01:54:07.750 --> 01:54:11.420\nthem properly during the install, that's\nit you'll never worry about it again.\n\n1984\n01:54:11.420 --> 01:54:15.580\nBut if you need to change them, now\nyou've seen a couple ways to go about it.\n\n1985\n01:54:15.580 --> 01:54:19.450\nAnd, I'll tell you NTP servers\nare pretty common place these days.\n\n1986\n01:54:19.450 --> 01:54:23.230\nNormally what you'll do is you'll\npick one system that your network and\n\n1987\n01:54:23.230 --> 01:54:24.890\nmake it an NTP server.\n\n1988\n01:54:24.890 --> 01:54:28.270\nAnd it can synchronize out\nagainst pooled or whatever.\n\n1989\n01:54:28.270 --> 01:54:31.170\nBut it becomes the one judge of and\n\n1990\n01:54:31.170 --> 01:54:34.090\nthen you set all of your other\nsystems to synchronize time off of it.\n\n1991\n01:54:34.090 --> 01:54:36.640\nYour routers, your switches,\nyour firewalls, your servers,\n\n1992\n01:54:36.640 --> 01:54:39.410\nyour workstations,\nyour voice over IP phones.\n\n1993\n01:54:39.410 --> 01:54:42.510\nThat way the clock is the same\nthroughout your entire company.\n\n1994\n01:54:42.510 --> 01:54:47.620\nIt makes it really great if you have some\nkind of incident, you can follow logs.\n\n1995\n01:54:47.620 --> 01:54:51.710\nAcross your servers and know that 1\npm on one server is the same as 1 pm\n\n1996\n01:54:51.710 --> 01:54:53.580\non the other server and\nthat's really important.\n\n1997\n01:54:54.670 --> 01:54:59.390\nSo all right, well that about\nall I've got for localization.\n\n1998\n01:54:59.390 --> 01:55:03.510\nYeah, I can't think of anything\nelse to throw in there.\n\n1999\n01:55:03.510 --> 01:55:05.920\nSo that pretty much wraps that one up,\n\n2000\n01:55:05.920 --> 01:55:09.370\nI do want to remind everybody that if you\never have any questions on this stuff.\n\n2001\n01:55:09.370 --> 01:55:14.570\nLive during the show, go to itpro.tv/live,\nyou'll see the chat box beneath the video.\n\n2002\n01:55:14.570 --> 01:55:17.740\nYou can post your questions there,\nwe monitor and answer during the

00:00:37.731\nWelcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:37.731 --> 00:00:40.391\nI'm your host Don Pezet,\ntoday with Mr. Nate Copeland.\n\n5\n00:00:40.391 --> 00:00:40.971\nHow's it going, Nate?\n\n6\n00:00:40.971 --> 00:00:41.971\n>> Yeah, pretty good, Don.\n\n7\n00:00:41.971 --> 00:00:43.750\nPretty good.\nGlad to be back for\n\n8\n00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:48.550\nanother fantastic bit of Linux+\nalthough no GUI today, so\n\n9\n00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.782\nwe'll be moving back into\nthe keyboard commander.\n\n10\n00:00:52.782 --> 00:00:53.702\n>> The realm of the unknown.\n\n11\n00:00:53.702 --> 00:00:54.202\n>> Yeah.\n\n12\n00:00:54.202 --> 00:00:56.671\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] So, Nate's exactly right.\n\n13\n00:00:56.671 --> 00:00:59.931\nWe had our day in the sun with\ngraphical user interface.\n\n14\n00:00:59.931 --> 00:01:03.461\nWe got a chance to see that interacted\na bit, but we're back to the command line.\n\n15\n00:01:03.461 --> 00:01:08.395\nSo today, we're gonna take\na look at what's objective 108\n\n16\n00:01:08.395 --> 00:01:10.731\nEssential System Services.\n\n17\n00:01:10.731 --> 00:01:14.035\nNow the definition of essential\nis somewhat debatable, but\n\n18\n00:01:14.035 --> 00:01:17.987\nmost Linux distributions have kind of\nagreed on a couple of services that\n\n19\n00:01:17.987 --> 00:01:21.452\nare important enough to include\nwith your install by default.\n\n20\n00:01:21.452 --> 00:01:25.282\nEven when you choose a minimal install,\nyou'll have a lot of these services.\n\n21\n00:01:25.282 --> 00:01:27.271\nSo, we're gonna take\na look at some of them.\n\n22\n00:01:27.271 --> 00:01:28.071\nHow they work?\n\n23\n00:01:28.071 --> 00:01:28.771\nWhat they do?\n\n24\n00:01:28.771 --> 00:01:30.231\nHow they can interact with them?\n\n25\n00:01:30.231 --> 00:01:32.651\nAnd kind of move through that.\n\n26\n00:01:32.651 --> 00:01:35.171\nWe're starting to kind of\nwind down on our objectives.\n\n27\n00:01:35.171 --> 00:01:39.111\nWe only have security and networking\nafter this, so the end is neigh.\n\n28\n00:01:39.111 --> 00:01:44.222\nThe end is in site for, not so\nmuch for neigh, but it's come along.\n\n29\n00:01:44.222 --> 00:01:46.582\nWe're almost to the end.\n\n30\n00:01:46.582 --> 00:01:49.971\nWell, what are some essential services?\n\n31\n00:01:49.971 --> 00:01:52.447\nWell, if you're spinning\nup a Linux server,\n\n32\n00:01:52.447 --> 00:01:56.572\nthe essential services are simply the ones\nyou need to achieve your goal, but\n\n33\n00:01:56.572 --> 00:01:59.761\nyour goal may be very different\nthan the rest of the planet.\n\n34\n00:01:59.761 --> 00:02:04.401\nIf you're spinning up a web server, then\nyou really need a web service on there.\n\n35\n00:02:04.401 --> 00:02:06.881\nMaybe Apache or something of that nature.\n\n36\n00:02:06.881 --> 00:02:10.721\nAnd so to you,\nApache is an essential service.\n\n37\n00:02:10.721 --> 00:02:15.672\nBut if I'm spinning up an email server,\nwhat do I care about a web server?\n\n38\n00:02:15.672 --> 00:02:17.531\nSo, it's not essential service to me.\n\n39\n00:02:17.531 --> 00:02:20.865\nSo just keep that in mind that\nthis is a little subjective,\n\n40\n00:02:20.865 --> 00:02:23.121\nwhatever it is that view as essential.\n\n41\n00:02:23.121 --> 00:02:27.403\nBut on the exam, we have a specific\nlist that we need to adhere to and\n\n42\n00:02:27.403 --> 00:02:30.631\nthe first one is one that\nis really hard to debate.\n\n43\n00:02:30.631 --> 00:02:33.420\nIt's the syslog daemon.\n\n44\n00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.690\nSyslog is the system log for\n\n45\n00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.150\nUnix and Linux and it is a service\nthat runs in the background.\n\n46\n00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:46.362\nAnd anytime there are messages,\nstatus updates, critical alerts, errors,\n\n47\n00:02:46.362 --> 00:02:51.419\ncrashes, information, any kind of\ngeneral activity that generates data,\n\n48\n00:02:51.419 --> 00:02:55.030\nit's gonna be logging that\ninto a log file somewhere.\n\n49\n00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.410\nAnd I know we've dabbled in to a little\nbit in some of the previous episode.\n\n50\n00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.561\nWe saw the log file,\nwe saw log rotate in the cron episode.\n\n51\n00:03:01.561 --> 00:03:05.930\nSo we've seen it, but\nwe haven't really looked at it directly.\n\n52\n00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.530\nNow, syslog is an integral part of Linux.\n\n53\n00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.969\nI cannot think of a single distribution\nthat does not have it installed and\n\n54\n00:03:12.969 --> 00:03:14.340\nturned on by default.\n\n55\n00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.960\nSo, it's almost a given that it's going\nto be there and running on your system.\n\n56\n00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:21.191\nIf your not sure,\nthere's an easy way to check.\n\n57\n00:03:21.191 --> 00:03:23.020\nLet me bring my system up.\n\n58\n00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:26.124\nNow this system, if you watched\nthe last episode, I went ahead and\n\n59\n00:03:26.124 --> 00:03:27.020\nwiped my machine.\n\n60\n00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:31.780\nSo, this is a stock install of CentOS 6.5.\n\n61\n00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.925\nNow I've created a few user accounts and\ngroups in it from that previous episode,\n\n62\n00:03:34.925 --> 00:03:37.905\nbut the only other thing I've done is\nconfigure the network of that product.\n\n63\n00:03:37.905 --> 00:03:39.025\nThe rest of it is all stock.\n\n64\n00:03:39.025 --> 00:03:43.015\nI've not actually installed\nany software on it at all.\n\n65\n00:03:43.015 --> 00:03:47.913\nAnd if I do a service --status-all and\nI'll just grep that for\n\n66\n00:03:47.913 --> 00:03:53.085\nthe word log since there's several\ndifferent logs that are there,\n\n67\n00:03:53.085 --> 00:03:56.910\nI can run that and\nI'll see rsyslogd right there.\n\n68\n00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:00.008\nThat is the syslog game and\nit's running in the background,\n\n69\n00:04:00.008 --> 00:04:02.510\nit's catching those log files and\nit's there.\n\n70\n00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:06.310\nYou can see where I checked just before\nthe shows just to make sure it was there.\n\n71\n00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:08.001\nOf course, it is.\n\n72\n00:04:08.001 --> 00:04:10.341\n>> So with the syslog being.\n\n73\n00:04:10.341 --> 00:04:13.962\nSo all the information stuff and\nthings that happened,\n\n74\n00:04:13.962 --> 00:04:18.750\nwhat about application stuff or\nanything else that's running on there?\n\n75\n00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.830\nDoes it also get logged to the syslog?\n\n76\n00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:23.010\n>> It can, most applications do.\n\n77\n00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:26.870\nSo when you run another server, like\nsay I bring up an email server on here.\n\n78\n00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:30.370\nYour email server is mostly likely\nlogging to your syslog server too.\n\n79\n00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:33.270\nNow I say most likely, they don't have to.\n\n80\n00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:37.177\nBy default, your operating system,\nyour Linux distribution,\n\n81\n00:04:37.177 --> 00:04:42.161\nit will log the syslog, but all the third\nparty software you install may or may not.\n\n82\n00:04:42.161 --> 00:04:45.477\nIf they create a system of that like\nif they caused a segment fault, well,\n\n83\n00:04:45.477 --> 00:04:47.520\nthe kernel will detect that, it'll log it.\n\n84\n00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.650\nAnd so, that'll make it in regardless of\nwhat the application was configured for.\n\n85\n00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:53.680\nBecause well, at that point,\nthe application's crashed.\n\n86\n00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.310\nBut if it's something like\nthe printing system and\n\n87\n00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:58.510\nyou send a print job out to a printer,\n\n88\n00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:01.650\nit's up to the printing system to decide\nwhether or not it's going to log that.\n\n89\n00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:05.831\nAnd our own scripts, things that we write.\n\n90\n00:05:05.831 --> 00:05:09.089\nWhen we write a script\nto perform activities,\n\n91\n00:05:09.089 --> 00:05:12.270\nthey can log to syslog\nalso if we tell them to.\n\n92\n00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:15.140\nNow we wrote some scripts\nin earlier episodes and\n\n93\n00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:19.130\nwe didn't do any logging in there,\nso our aren't reporting back.\n\n94\n00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:22.090\nWe can make the do that, if we want.\n\n95\n00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:24.924\nSo to get an idea of some of\nthe things that do get logged, well,\n\n96\n00:05:24.924 --> 00:05:26.800\nlet's take a look at the log file itself.\n\n97\n00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:32.351\nThe log file is stored in /var/log.\n\n98\n00:05:32.351 --> 00:05:34.971\nAnd if you look in there,\nyou'll see several log files.\n\n99\n00:05:34.971 --> 00:05:37.620\nThe one that we want is called messages.\n\n100\n00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:42.100\nSo, it's /var/log/messages.\n\n101\n00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:47.259\nAnd if I just do a more messages,\nI can take a look at what's in there and\n\n102\n00:05:47.259 --> 00:05:52.158\nit's gonna start from, well,\nusually when my system booted up,\n\n103\n00:05:52.158 --> 00:05:56.025\nso I can see right there my\nkernel log is starting up.\n\n104\n00:05:56.025 --> 00:06:00.860\nSyslog is starting up and then we get\ninformation about the kernel initializing.\n\n105\n00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:03.331\nSo, this is when our system\nis booting early on.\n\n106\n00:06:03.331 --> 00:06:05.571\nSo, we're gonna see boot\ninformation in here.\n\n107\n00:06:05.571 --> 00:06:08.460\nThat's gonna be very similar to dmesg.\n\n108\n00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:11.660\nRemember, dmesg shows us all\nthat boot time event stuff?\n\n109\n00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:13.440\nThat's what I'm seeing here also.\n\n110\n00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:16.740\nSo, it's actually kind of\nduplicating that information.\n\n111\n00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:20.800\nThe difference is that in syslog, it's\ngonna go beyond that and show even more.\n\n112\n00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:23.400\nAnd the other thing that's really,\n\n113\n00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:29.000\nreally useful about syslog is it records\na timestamp with each of these events.\n\n114\n00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.310\nSo if I see things like this here,\nthe APIC all being mapped.\n\n115\n00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:37.950\nIf I take a look at dmesg, I can\nprobably find that same stuff in here.\n\n116\n00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:41.772\nHere's all those APIC being mapped,\nbut notice that difference.\n\n117\n00:06:41.772 --> 00:06:44.061\nI should have done this in a separate TTI.\n\n118\n00:06:44.061 --> 00:06:45.181\nFlip back and forth.\n\n119\n00:06:45.181 --> 00:06:49.221\nLet me do that.\n\n120\n00:06:49.221 --> 00:06:50.461\nI want to do it.\n\n121\n00:06:50.461 --> 00:06:51.841\nOops, I'm gonna do a comparison.\n\n122\n00:06:51.841 --> 00:06:54.781\nIf I get the right file name here,\nthat will help.\n\n123\n00:06:54.781 --> 00:06:56.805\nSys var/sys log/messages.\n\n124\n00:06:56.805 --> 00:06:57.761\nShoot.\n\n125\n00:06:57.761 --> 00:06:59.812\nI don't have information.\n\n126\n00:06:59.812 --> 00:07:03.652\nYeah, the irregular users aren't allowed\nto go and poke around in the syslog.\n\n127\n00:07:03.652 --> 00:07:08.832\nThat's not a good idea, there.\n\n128\n00:07:08.832 --> 00:07:13.419\nSo here's all those APICs\nbeing mapped in syslog and\n\n129\n00:07:13.419 --> 00:07:18.330\nhere's all the APICs being mapped in,\njust the dmesg.\n\n130\n00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:21.158\nSo if I compare these back and\nforth, moving between them,\n\n131\n00:07:21.158 --> 00:07:22.581\nnotice what's being added.\n\n132\n00:07:22.581 --> 00:07:25.630\nHere, we have SRAT all the way\nthrough the node number.\n\n133\n00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:31.870\nAnd back over here, I've got\na bunch of information before SRAT.\n\n134\n00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:34.131\nWhat is it?\nWell, the first part is the time stamp.\n\n135\n00:07:34.131 --> 00:07:36.411\nThe timestamp is really important.\n\n136\n00:07:36.411 --> 00:07:40.751\nIf you're troubleshooting stuff, if you're\ntrying to find a pattern in an error,\n\n137\n00:07:40.751 --> 00:07:42.533\nyou need to know when it occurred.\n\n138\n00:07:42.533 --> 00:07:46.513\nAnd so, I can see that time\nstamp right there at 4:26 AM.\n\n139\n00:07:46.513 --> 00:07:50.693\nThis is just part of our reboot,\nthen you've got two more entries.\n\n140\n00:07:50.693 --> 00:07:53.454\nThat entry after the timestamp says,\nlocal host.\n\n141\n00:07:53.454 --> 00:07:56.761\nThat's the computer that\nthis error happened on.\n\n142\n00:07:56.761 --> 00:07:57.295\nAlright?\n\n143\n00:07:57.295 --> 00:08:00.452\nIf you got one server you're just gonna\nsee that one servers name over and\n\n144\n00:08:00.452 --> 00:08:04.430\nover and over again, that's where all\nthese sys log messages came from.\n\n145\n00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:07.305\nBut, what if you have 100 servers?\n\n146\n00:08:07.305 --> 00:08:09.335\nWhen you get to work in the morning,\nyou don't wanna go and\n\n147\n00:08:09.335 --> 00:08:12.435\ncheck the logs of 100 different servers.\n\n148\n00:08:12.435 --> 00:08:16.545\nSo what a lot of us will do is configure\nremote syslog, we're gonna see this\n\n149\n00:08:16.545 --> 00:08:20.770\na little bit later, where we\naggregate all of our logs together.\n\n150\n00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:22.530\nWe take all 100 of our servers and\n\n151\n00:08:22.530 --> 00:08:24.930\ntell them all to send their\nlogs to the same place.\n\n152\n00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:30.080\nSo as you're looking at these messages\nyou might see webserver01, webserver02,\n\n153\n00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:32.940\nmailserver01, ftpserver03.\n\n154\n00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:35.990\nYou know, each of the different\nsystems in your network, so\n\n155\n00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:38.750\nthat you can recognize which\nserver generated the message.\n\n156\n00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:42.690\nThen you see the source of the message.\n\n157\n00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:46.170\nWhat system or what subsystem\nwas it that caused this message?\n\n158\n00:08:46.170 --> 00:08:47.390\nHere it's a boot message.\n\n159\n00:08:47.390 --> 00:08:50.740\nSo I see kernel,\nthe kernel caused this stuff.\n\n160\n00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:53.760\nYou don't see any of that in d message.\n\n161\n00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:57.430\nD message that's just showing the boot\ntime messages that are generated.\n\n162\n00:08:57.430 --> 00:09:00.270\nNo timestamp, no source, no machine name.\n\n163\n00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:02.560\nThis is it.\nIt's for this one machine.\n\n164\n00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:08.750\nSo syslog just inherently is\ngiving us more data thanks to\n\n165\n00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:14.260\nthe extra information that it stores as\npart of its log file format, all right?\n\n166\n00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:19.150\nSo it is a great place to go and\nI'll find oftentimes that I go to CISLog\n\n167\n00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:23.840\nmore often then dMessage when looking for\nboot time messages.\n\n168\n00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:24.810\n>> All right, so Don, yeah, so\n\n169\n00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:29.860\nthe earliest bit of that was being logged\nin your and syslog starts at boot time,\n\n170\n00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:34.530\nwhat about logs from yesterday and\nthe day before?\n\n171\n00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:40.260\n>> So in the cron episode I mentioned\na little process called log rotate, right?\n\n172\n00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:44.560\nLog rotate just says, well the default\nconfiguration is once a week\n\n173\n00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:47.460\n>> The syslog server will\n\n174\n00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:48.860\nrename the messages file.\n\n175\n00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:52.160\nAnd it'll be messages., and\nthe date that it was renamed.\n\n176\n00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:53.680\nAnd it'll create an all new one.\n\n177\n00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:55.810\nAnd so\nit's breaking it up into weekly files.\n\n178\n00:09:55.810 --> 00:09:58.830\nSo every week it's basically\nbacking that up and archiving.\n\n179\n00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:01.770\nAnd the default in CentOS is\nto hold it for four weeks.\n\n180\n00:10:01.770 --> 00:10:07.080\nSo we'll have this week's data and the\nfour prior weeks of data sitting there,\n\n181\n00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:10.230\nso we could go back up to,\ntechnically up to five weeks,\n\n182\n00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:12.280\ndepending on where we're at in the week.\n\n183\n00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:15.220\nBut up to five weeks to\nsee the historical data.\n\n184\n00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:18.910\nNow you can manipulate that all you want,\nyou can change it to go back much further.\n\n185\n00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:21.810\nBut the idea is that you should\nbe backing these files up and\n\n186\n00:10:21.810 --> 00:10:23.110\nstoring them somewhere else.\n\n187\n00:10:23.110 --> 00:10:26.380\nSo we'll see an example of that later,\nright?\n\n188\n00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:30.470\nThe other thing worth noting is sure,\nthat dmesg information is in here, right?\n\n189\n00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:32.780\nWell, dmesg starts right away.\n\n190\n00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:37.070\nIf I take a look at the very\nfirst thing in dmesg,\n\n191\n00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:41.530\nsee how I get Initializing\ncgroup subsys cpuset?\n\n192\n00:10:41.530 --> 00:10:44.530\nAnd I actually see the kernel\nstarting right there.\n\n193\n00:10:44.530 --> 00:10:46.910\nLinux version 2.6.32 and so on.\n\n194\n00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:49.880\nI start to see some bios dumps, and\n\n195\n00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:54.360\nthen as I move down a little bit further,\nhere I see kernel detect mapping,\n\n196\n00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:58.910\nACPI, and then then there's\nthe APICS mapping, right?\n\n197\n00:10:58.910 --> 00:11:05.720\nWhen I looked in the syslog messages,\nall right?\n\n198\n00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:08.430\nI don't actually see\nthe Kernel boot message.\n\n199\n00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:13.320\nIf I look in here, if I look for that\nvm line is whatever or the true Kernel.\n\n200\n00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:14.820\nI actually do see it, It's right there.\n\n201\n00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:16.429\nYeah it did make it in there.\n\n202\n00:11:16.429 --> 00:11:17.555\nYep so there it is.\n\n203\n00:11:17.555 --> 00:11:18.970\nIt did make it in.\n\n204\n00:11:18.970 --> 00:11:23.520\nThere are some things, some events\nthat happen before sys log d starts.\n\n205\n00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:25.890\nSyslogd is one of the first\nthing that start but\n\n206\n00:11:25.890 --> 00:11:27.730\nthere are some thing's that\nhappen right before it so\n\n207\n00:11:27.730 --> 00:11:30.480\nthose can't make it in the logs\nbecause it's not started yet.\n\n208\n00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:34.540\nSo if you have a kernel failure or usually\nit's like a initrd, that initial ram disk,\n\n209\n00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:38.910\nif you have a failure there, it might\nnot make it into Syslog do you know,\n\n210\n00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:42.310\nthose programs are all set to, you feel\nlike segment fault or whatever that fill\n\n211\n00:11:42.310 --> 00:11:45.370\nthe errors on the screen and\nit's gonna stop you from booting.\n\n212\n00:11:45.370 --> 00:11:48.410\nSo it's pretty obvious you had a failure\nand information is right there.\n\n213\n00:11:48.410 --> 00:11:50.680\nSo it's not the end of the world\nthat it's not in syslog.\n\n214\n00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:53.630\nBut there are times that there might be\na little something in dmessage that didn't\n\n215\n00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:55.020\nmake it into syslog.\n\n216\n00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:57.900\nSo one is not necessarily\na replacement for the other.\n\n217\n00:11:57.900 --> 00:12:02.310\nWe use them together to get that full\npicture of what happened during boot.\n\n218\n00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:06.440\nNow dmesg really just focuses\nin on that hardware information,\n\n219\n00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:08.660\nhardware that might've\nchanged on our system.\n\n220\n00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:12.455\nBut Syslog continues going after boot.\n\n221\n00:12:12.455 --> 00:12:16.635\nSo if we get past all this boot stuff and\nmove past this, right.\n\n222\n00:12:16.635 --> 00:12:18.685\nSo again, you're still mapping hardware.\n\n223\n00:12:18.685 --> 00:12:21.175\nThis is all still part\nof the boot process.\n\n224\n00:12:21.175 --> 00:12:25.440\nAnd when it's done dmessage\nstops unless hardware changes.\n\n225\n00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:28.150\nIf your hardware doesn't change,\nif you don't add or remove any devices,\n\n226\n00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:29.850\ndmessage really stops.\n\n227\n00:12:29.850 --> 00:12:32.360\nBut syslog keeps running.\n\n228\n00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:35.090\nSo let me just get past all this mess.\n\n229\n00:12:35.090 --> 00:12:37.580\nI think this is all still boot time stuff.\n\n230\n00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:43.700\nAnd what you'll see is after our\nboot finishes then syslog continues\n\n231\n00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:49.850\nto log messages not just for boot and\nsystem activity but software activity.\n\n232\n00:12:49.850 --> 00:12:52.060\nWe'll see things like our\nservices starting and\n\n233\n00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:57.550\nany errors that might be generated there\ngee, I'm still kinda, there we go.\n\n234\n00:12:57.550 --> 00:12:58.770\nSo right here I see dhcp client.\n\n235\n00:12:58.770 --> 00:13:03.230\nAll right, so after I boot it\nup I had to get a dhcp address.\n\n236\n00:13:03.230 --> 00:13:05.360\nAnd so\nI can see where I sent out a request,\n\n237\n00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:11.030\nI got an acknowledgement from a server\nat 192.168.29.254 They offered me an IP,\n\n238\n00:13:11.030 --> 00:13:16.140\nI accepted it, I see the whole DHCP\nexchange right here in syslog.\n\n239\n00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:18.270\nNow it's not gonna make it in D message,\n\n240\n00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:22.120\ncuz D message is purely focused on\nthe colonel's handling of hardware.\n\n241\n00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:24.810\nSyslog though,\nwill get whatever logs to it.\n\n242\n00:13:24.810 --> 00:13:28.020\nAnd the DHCP client is\nconfigured to log to syslog.\n\n243\n00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:30.050\nSo I can see it right there.\n\n244\n00:13:31.230 --> 00:13:35.060\nNow you saw how I had to page through\nall of that stuff to get here.\n\n245\n00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:37.010\nThat's probably the biggest\nnegative with syslog.\n\n246\n00:13:37.010 --> 00:13:40.120\nIt's massive,\nit is a big file or it can be.\n\n247\n00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:42.470\nThe longer you run,\nthe bigger that file is gonna be.\n\n248\n00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:45.720\nMy system was fresh\ninstalled this morning.\n\n249\n00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:49.390\nAnd it is almost 2 o'clock so\nmy system has been running for\n\n250\n00:13:49.390 --> 00:13:51.520\nabout eight hours, okay?\n\n251\n00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:56.791\nAnd in eight hours my syslog file,\nlet's see how big it is.\n\n252\n00:13:59.717 --> 00:14:06.410\nIt is /var, it helps if I put\nin the right directory name.\n\n253\n00:14:06.410 --> 00:14:08.810\nThere we go, let's see.\n\n254\n00:14:08.810 --> 00:14:12.320\nIf those are bytes, it's 187 K in size.\n\n255\n00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:13.690\nSo that's pretty big.\n\n256\n00:14:13.690 --> 00:14:16.080\nAnd it's gonna continue to get bigger and\nbigger.\n\n257\n00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:19.170\nInto megs and eventually tens of megs.\n\n258\n00:14:19.170 --> 00:14:20.490\nIt can be a ton of data.\n\n259\n00:14:20.490 --> 00:14:23.750\nSo we rarely just dive right\nin to the sys log file.\n\n260\n00:14:23.750 --> 00:14:26.980\nWe normally hunt for\nspecific things that we're looking for.\n\n261\n00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:30.790\nWe might be looking for\nthat information about DHCP so\n\n262\n00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:37.050\nI might say more /var/log/messages and\n\n263\n00:14:37.050 --> 00:14:41.150\nI'll pipe that into grep and\nI'll look for dhclient, right.\n\n264\n00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:46.840\nI want to see in the DHTP information and\nnow I get just the dhclient stuff and\n\n265\n00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:51.810\nso I can see where I got\nan address at 101 pm and\n\n266\n00:14:51.810 --> 00:14:55.610\nI can see where I did some renewals,\napparently several times.\n\n267\n00:14:55.610 --> 00:15:00.170\nI've got several communications at 113,\n147, 142 So\n\n268\n00:15:00.170 --> 00:15:02.220\nI must have reboot\nthe machine a few times.\n\n269\n00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:05.000\nSo I can see all that different\nstuff happening right there,\n\n270\n00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:09.240\nand I've got that record, I can page\nthrough it and look at it, all right.\n\n271\n00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:11.290\nWe could also search by that server name.\n\n272\n00:15:11.290 --> 00:15:13.090\nAll of mine are localhost, right.\n\n273\n00:15:13.090 --> 00:15:17.970\nBut if I had web server 01 logging here,\nI could grep that just for web server 01.\n\n274\n00:15:17.970 --> 00:15:21.680\nAnd then I would just see the log\nmessages for that one server.\n\n275\n00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:25.100\nIn my case I don't have\nanything like that.\n\n276\n00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:29.600\n>> So then crawling through so then so you\ncould then, each day you come in you could\n\n277\n00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:32.910\nhave one of the crawling jobs run and\njust kind of scrape this whole thing.\n\n278\n00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:34.430\nLook for certain events.\n\n279\n00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:37.300\nThese system messages and\npop those guys up?\n\n280\n00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:39.280\n>> You could.\nI've seen people where they do that,\n\n281\n00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:40.560\nthey create a cron job and\n\n282\n00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:43.430\nit says, look for these messages and\nshoot me an email if you find them.\n\n283\n00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:45.048\nYou can set things up like that.\n\n284\n00:15:45.048 --> 00:15:46.765\nI don't typically do that but\n\n285\n00:15:46.765 --> 00:15:50.957\nthere's probably software that does\nit really well like SpiceWorks and\n\n286\n00:15:50.957 --> 00:15:55.091\nSolarWinds, what was there,\nthere was Network Manager or whatever.\n\n287\n00:15:55.091 --> 00:15:57.674\nNetwork Performance Manager,\nNPM, I think that was it.\n\n288\n00:15:57.674 --> 00:16:00.447\nSo anyhow, there's a lot of people out\nthere that makes software that will do\n\n289\n00:16:00.447 --> 00:16:01.782\nthat they will monitor your syslog.\n\n290\n00:16:01.782 --> 00:16:05.129\nAnd when events that matches certain\ncriteria here that will flag you,\n\n291\n00:16:05.129 --> 00:16:08.010\nyou can create your own jobs\nto do that too if you want.\n\n292\n00:16:08.010 --> 00:16:11.962\nI just typically,\nI just don't wanna deal with emails.\n\n293\n00:16:11.962 --> 00:16:13.838\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Cuz it's kinda my thing.\n\n294\n00:16:13.838 --> 00:16:16.322\nIf there's a problem obviously\nwe wanna know about it though.\n\n295\n00:16:16.322 --> 00:16:20.295\nAnd so, what I've done in the past\nis take these syslog messages and\n\n296\n00:16:20.295 --> 00:16:22.467\nthrow them in like a MySQL database.\n\n297\n00:16:22.467 --> 00:16:25.149\nAnd then once they're there,\nyou can create a web front-end and\n\n298\n00:16:25.149 --> 00:16:27.165\njust like navigate and\nsay, show me the errors.\n\n299\n00:16:27.165 --> 00:16:28.295\nI just wanna see the errors.\n\n300\n00:16:28.295 --> 00:16:29.489\nI wanna see the critical stuff.\n\n301\n00:16:29.489 --> 00:16:34.930\nSo you can do things like that to filter\nit, just so you see what you really want.\n\n302\n00:16:34.930 --> 00:16:38.515\nOther things that we might do,\nwe might search based on severity.\n\n303\n00:16:38.515 --> 00:16:40.677\nWe'll see that a little bit later or\nsearch for\n\n304\n00:16:40.677 --> 00:16:42.462\na particular type of thing to happen.\n\n305\n00:16:42.462 --> 00:16:45.823\nIf I have something crash right now, so\nI'm in the middle of doing something.\n\n306\n00:16:45.823 --> 00:16:47.249\nAnd all of a sudden, it crashes out.\n\n307\n00:16:47.249 --> 00:16:52.337\nA lot of times I'll use\nthe tail command and I'll say,\n\n308\n00:16:52.337 --> 00:16:59.763\ntail /var/log/messages and that's\ngonna say, show me the last ten lines.\n\n309\n00:16:59.763 --> 00:17:00.794\nShow me the last ten lines.\n\n310\n00:17:00.794 --> 00:17:03.441\nThat's what would just\nhappen on my system,\n\n311\n00:17:03.441 --> 00:17:06.933\ntail /var/log/messages will\nshow the last ten events.\n\n312\n00:17:06.933 --> 00:17:09.023\nAnd so, you can see what's going on.\n\n313\n00:17:09.023 --> 00:17:13.110\nIf you just had a crash, it'll likely\nbe that last entry in your system.\n\n314\n00:17:13.110 --> 00:17:17.993\nSo, something easy to check.\n\n315\n00:17:17.993 --> 00:17:21.569\nSo, that's kind of the basics\nof what the log file looks like.\n\n316\n00:17:21.569 --> 00:17:23.849\nNow, I do wanna dive a little\nbit more into it and\n\n317\n00:17:23.849 --> 00:17:27.780\none way that is kinda handy is to see\nthe configuration file for syslog.\n\n318\n00:17:27.780 --> 00:17:30.500\nA lot of people just leave it\nat the default and that's fine.\n\n319\n00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:34.893\nThe default is that most messages are\ngonna be sent right here to this messages\n\n320\n00:17:34.893 --> 00:17:39.694\nfile and that's what you're gonna see, but\nthere's a ton of manipulations that we\n\n321\n00:17:39.694 --> 00:17:44.315\ncan make to it and you'll see that if you\nedit the configuration file for syslog.\n\n322\n00:17:44.315 --> 00:17:52.326\nIt is /etc/rsyslog.conf.\n\n323\n00:17:52.326 --> 00:17:57.501\n/etc/rsyslog.conf.\n\n324\n00:17:57.501 --> 00:18:02.308\nAnd if you edit that file,\nyou're gonna see a bunch of stuff.\n\n325\n00:18:02.308 --> 00:18:05.110\nAnd some of it is really confusing,\n[COUGH] but\n\n326\n00:18:05.110 --> 00:18:07.556\nmost of it is pretty straightforward.\n\n327\n00:18:07.556 --> 00:18:11.143\nSo, let me go through some of the more\nimportant lines that are in here.\n\n328\n00:18:11.143 --> 00:18:14.650\nMost the lines you'll notice have a little\npound symbol at the beginning of them and\n\n329\n00:18:14.650 --> 00:18:17.320\nthat's the indicator that says,\nthis line is commented out.\n\n330\n00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:19.628\nThey're just notes to help\nyou kind of guide along.\n\n331\n00:18:19.628 --> 00:18:23.396\nSo if you look, you'll find lines, but\ndon't have pound symbols at the beginning.\n\n332\n00:18:23.396 --> 00:18:27.839\nThe lines I have like a dollar sign, for\nexample and this is usually setting some\n\n333\n00:18:27.839 --> 00:18:31.434\nkind of variable or\nconfiguration to tell you what it's doing.\n\n334\n00:18:31.434 --> 00:18:36.462\nSo here, for example, I can see\nthis imuxsock that it's loading and\n\n335\n00:18:36.462 --> 00:18:41.334\nyou'll say, this as provides support for\nlocal system logging.\n\n336\n00:18:41.334 --> 00:18:44.568\nAnd what that means is if you\nwanna be able to log to syslog,\n\n337\n00:18:44.568 --> 00:18:46.879\nmost software does it through an API, but\n\n338\n00:18:46.879 --> 00:18:51.320\nwe can do it through commands like logger\nand it's this line that enables that.\n\n339\n00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:53.286\nSo if we want that, there we go.\n\n340\n00:18:53.286 --> 00:18:54.763\nSo, that's what most of these are doing.\n\n341\n00:18:54.763 --> 00:18:58.937\nProvides kernel logging support by klogd.\n\n342\n00:18:58.937 --> 00:19:02.649\nKlogd, that's what does the kernel\nlogging and we normally want that and so\n\n343\n00:19:02.649 --> 00:19:05.147\nit's got its own special method for\ninserting in.\n\n344\n00:19:05.147 --> 00:19:07.230\nSo, I see that message there about klog.\n\n345\n00:19:08.340 --> 00:19:13.734\nNow you'll notice I keep calling it\nsyslog, but here they show as rsyslog.\n\n346\n00:19:13.734 --> 00:19:15.369\nIt's evolved over time.\n\n347\n00:19:15.369 --> 00:19:18.960\nOriginally, it was just syslog and\nthe demon was syslogd.\n\n348\n00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:22.628\nThe newer version and by newer,\nI mean, it came out ten years ago.\n\n349\n00:19:22.628 --> 00:19:25.295\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] It is now rsyslogd and\n\n350\n00:19:25.295 --> 00:19:26.926\nit replace the old one.\n\n351\n00:19:26.926 --> 00:19:30.259\nSo we don't have the old just\nplain old syslogd anymore,\n\n352\n00:19:30.259 --> 00:19:33.785\nnow it's rsyslogd and\nklogd was replaced by rklogd.\n\n353\n00:19:33.785 --> 00:19:38.532\nSo going back historically, a lot of\nthis stuff was developed under Unix and\n\n354\n00:19:38.532 --> 00:19:42.314\nthen it split and you had some\nthings developed under Unix and\n\n355\n00:19:42.314 --> 00:19:44.477\nsome things developed under BSD.\n\n356\n00:19:44.477 --> 00:19:47.564\nAnd the BSD stuff in a lot\ncases was better and\n\n357\n00:19:47.564 --> 00:19:52.589\nit got merged back into Unix into\nLinux and so then, the names changed.\n\n358\n00:19:52.589 --> 00:19:54.874\nSo a lot of times,\nyou'll see where products or\n\n359\n00:19:54.874 --> 00:19:57.112\ncommands have two\ndifferent names like that.\n\n360\n00:19:57.112 --> 00:20:00.364\nWe can see with the default port for\n\n361\n00:20:00.364 --> 00:20:05.648\nthis is gonna be on UDP port 15 or\n514, UDP 514.\n\n362\n00:20:05.648 --> 00:20:06.563\nSorry, guys.\n\n363\n00:20:06.563 --> 00:20:10.162\nIt's only written right there on\nthe screen, if I say the right thing.\n\n364\n00:20:10.162 --> 00:20:14.424\nSo it runs on UDP 514 by default,\nyou can change it if you want.\n\n365\n00:20:14.424 --> 00:20:17.626\nI typically don't, because it's\na nice number you can memorize.\n\n366\n00:20:17.626 --> 00:20:20.170\nBut if you start changing it,\nthen it becomes difficult.\n\n367\n00:20:20.170 --> 00:20:21.970\nSo you'll see that these\nare actually commented out,\n\n368\n00:20:21.970 --> 00:20:24.320\nwhich just means it's\ngonna use the default.\n\n369\n00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:27.200\nSo any time you don't have a value set,\nit just goes with the default.\n\n370\n00:20:29.490 --> 00:20:32.890\nNow, if we keep moving down and we can see\nsome of the other things that are in here\n\n371\n00:20:32.890 --> 00:20:38.560\nlike our global directives this is\nwhere it indicates things like what\n\n372\n00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:40.660\nother configurations we're pulling in.\n\n373\n00:20:40.660 --> 00:20:41.890\nThis line is really important.\n\n374\n00:20:43.030 --> 00:20:46.720\nWherever my mouse went, there we go.\n\n375\n00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:50.326\nThis line right here where it says,\n\n376\n00:20:50.326 --> 00:20:55.380\nIncludeConfig /etc/rsyslog.d/*.conf.\n\n377\n00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:56.388\nWhat is it talking about?\n\n378\n00:20:56.388 --> 00:21:01.242\nWell, syslog has its own configuration\nfile, but your other applications may\n\n379\n00:21:01.242 --> 00:21:06.107\nhave their own configuration file that\ndictates how they want to log to syslog.\n\n380\n00:21:06.107 --> 00:21:11.096\nAnd they will park them right\nin that directory there,\n\n381\n00:21:11.096 --> 00:21:14.357\n/etc/rsyslog.d/ something.\n\n382\n00:21:14.357 --> 00:21:18.894\nSo this line is saying, hey, when you load\nthis config file, load those guys also.\n\n383\n00:21:18.894 --> 00:21:23.220\nGo ahead and reach into that directory and\npull out whatever's in there,\n\n384\n00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:24.488\nif we wanna see that.\n\n385\n00:21:24.488 --> 00:21:29.002\nSo if I go into /etc/rsyslog.d,\n\n386\n00:21:29.002 --> 00:21:32.916\nI apparently don't have any.\n\n387\n00:21:32.916 --> 00:21:37.854\nSo if we had something like postfix and\nit wanted to have it's own\n\n388\n00:21:37.854 --> 00:21:43.897\nconfiguration file, then we would just\ncreate a postfix.conf file in here.\n\n389\n00:21:43.897 --> 00:21:47.338\nAnd now,\nI would go into that postfix.conf and\n\n390\n00:21:47.338 --> 00:21:50.440\nput in any special settings related to it.\n\n391\n00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:54.113\nAnd when the main rsyslog.d\nconfig file is called,\n\n392\n00:21:54.113 --> 00:21:58.380\nit will in turn call anything\nthat is here in this directory.\n\n393\n00:21:58.380 --> 00:22:02.505\n>> So then if you wanted to have certain\nthings, I guess appear in the sislog and\n\n394\n00:22:02.505 --> 00:22:06.693\nthat's where you would put their\nconfiguration file, so they get loaded and\n\n395\n00:22:06.693 --> 00:22:08.060\npost messages in there?\n\n396\n00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:10.244\n>> If you wanted to override\ntheir default behavior.\n\n397\n00:22:10.244 --> 00:22:13.088\nIf you're happy with the default behavior,\nyou don't have to do anything and\n\n398\n00:22:13.088 --> 00:22:14.739\nthat's kinda nice, but I mention postfix.\n\n399\n00:22:14.739 --> 00:22:18.284\nI'm running postfix, I don't need\nto override its default behavior.\n\n400\n00:22:18.284 --> 00:22:20.228\nBut if I want to,\nthat's the way to go about it.\n\n401\n00:22:20.228 --> 00:22:21.004\n>> Yep.\n\n402\n00:22:21.004 --> 00:22:22.523\n>> Nice.\n\n403\n00:22:22.523 --> 00:22:27.034\n>> The next part are the rules and\nthe rules are saying what we're\n\n404\n00:22:27.034 --> 00:22:32.066\nactually going to do and the rules\nare all built around two concepts,\n\n405\n00:22:32.066 --> 00:22:35.580\nwhich is a facility and a severity.\n\n406\n00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:37.770\nLet's take a minute and talk about those.\n\n407\n00:22:37.770 --> 00:22:40.249\nSometimes, I have too\nmuch time on my hands and\n\n408\n00:22:40.249 --> 00:22:42.420\nthat last night was one of those nights.\n\n409\n00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:46.456\nAnd so I created some little charts and\nnow in hindsight,\n\n410\n00:22:46.456 --> 00:22:49.902\nregret how long it took me,\nbut I made some little\n\n411\n00:22:49.902 --> 00:22:54.880\ncharts that show the facilities and\nthe severities that cislog uses.\n\n412\n00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:59.043\nNow facilities used to be listed\nby numbers, they aren't anymore.\n\n413\n00:22:59.043 --> 00:23:00.492\nNow, they're listed by facility name.\n\n414\n00:23:00.492 --> 00:23:03.055\nSo I went ahead and did both the old\nnumber, and the new facility name.\n\n415\n00:23:03.055 --> 00:23:06.408\nOn the exam, you'll probably\njust see the facility name.\n\n416\n00:23:06.408 --> 00:23:09.171\nMessages come from somewhere.\n\n417\n00:23:09.171 --> 00:23:12.996\nWhen a message is generated in syslog,\nit had to come from somewhere and\n\n418\n00:23:12.996 --> 00:23:15.634\nit's the facility that\nsays where it came from.\n\n419\n00:23:15.634 --> 00:23:19.312\nAnd where it came from or\nwhere we're choosing to store it, so\n\n420\n00:23:19.312 --> 00:23:20.597\nyou can override it.\n\n421\n00:23:20.597 --> 00:23:23.687\nSo you can say,\nthis logs to Kern, for example.\n\n422\n00:23:23.687 --> 00:23:27.667\nEven though it's not a kernel message, you\ncan have messages go there, if you want.\n\n423\n00:23:27.667 --> 00:23:32.004\nSo by default though, these facilities\nmatch where the data comes from.\n\n424\n00:23:32.004 --> 00:23:37.970\nSo kern would identify a kernel message,\nsomething generated by the Linux kernel.\n\n425\n00:23:37.970 --> 00:23:42.890\nUser would indicate things that were\ngenerated by applications we were running.\n\n426\n00:23:42.890 --> 00:23:45.810\nSo, something we did\ngenerated that message.\n\n427\n00:23:45.810 --> 00:23:47.513\nMail would be for our mail system.\n\n428\n00:23:47.513 --> 00:23:51.711\nDaemon, that would be for any service\nthat we've got running in the background.\n\n429\n00:23:51.711 --> 00:23:55.621\nAuth, that's for authentication and\nauthorization activities.\n\n430\n00:23:55.621 --> 00:23:58.221\nWe've got sys log, those are for\nthe sys log itself.\n\n431\n00:23:58.221 --> 00:23:59.567\nIf it has a problem.\n\n432\n00:23:59.567 --> 00:24:04.196\nWhen it does a log rotate it will go there\nor if the hard drive runs out of space and\n\n433\n00:24:04.196 --> 00:24:07.790\nit can't log, it will try and\nput it there but usually fail.\n\n434\n00:24:07.790 --> 00:24:09.970\nLPR's for the printing sub system.\n\n435\n00:24:09.970 --> 00:24:12.950\nNews if you're running a network\nnews transport protocol server.\n\n436\n00:24:12.950 --> 00:24:14.320\nNot many people do anymore.\n\n437\n00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:17.320\nUUCP if you're using units\nto units copy again.\n\n438\n00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:18.830\nNot many people do that anymore.\n\n439\n00:24:18.830 --> 00:24:21.000\nSome of this stuff is pretty old.\n\n440\n00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:22.256\nOff priv.\n\n441\n00:24:22.256 --> 00:24:26.472\nThat's for private authentication, so when\nwe're authenticating on just our system,\n\n442\n00:24:26.472 --> 00:24:28.089\nnot like shared authentication.\n\n443\n00:24:28.089 --> 00:24:31.370\nFTP.\nYou'll see a few other ones that are not\n\n444\n00:24:31.370 --> 00:24:35.440\nreally used anymore like NTP,\nlog audit, log alert.\n\n445\n00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:38.540\nThey're there, they exist, but\nthey don't really get used.\n\n446\n00:24:38.540 --> 00:24:44.880\nCron, has its own facility and then local0\nthrough local7, what the heck are those?\n\n447\n00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:47.172\nThose are for us, we can use them for\nwhatever we want.\n\n448\n00:24:47.172 --> 00:24:51.215\nIf I have an application and I wanna log\nit, I don't necessarily want it to just\n\n449\n00:24:51.215 --> 00:24:54.769\nlog to user dot whatever cuz it will\nblend in with everything else, so\n\n450\n00:24:54.769 --> 00:24:56.260\nI might say, you know what?\n\n451\n00:24:56.260 --> 00:25:00.220\nFor my database application,\nI want all of its logs to go to local1.\n\n452\n00:25:00.220 --> 00:25:03.620\nAll right, and I want my email\nserver to log everything local too.\n\n453\n00:25:03.620 --> 00:25:07.680\nAnd that way, if I ever wanna see database\nmessages, I can just run a query against\n\n454\n00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:10.860\nSyslog and just look for local1, and\nI know those will be my database entries.\n\n455\n00:25:10.860 --> 00:25:14.690\nAnd I can look for local2 and\nthose will be my email server entries.\n\n456\n00:25:14.690 --> 00:25:18.490\nSo, these are ones that are available for\nus to use as we please.\n\n457\n00:25:18.490 --> 00:25:20.690\nAnd many distributions already do that.\n\n458\n00:25:20.690 --> 00:25:24.260\nSo I consent to us use local7 and\nsome stuff.\n\n459\n00:25:24.260 --> 00:25:26.780\nSo you may see them in use\nin your system already.\n\n460\n00:25:27.798 --> 00:25:31.010\nSo, when syslog messages are generated,\n\n461\n00:25:31.010 --> 00:25:34.140\nthey'll have a facility attached to\nthem that shows where they came from.\n\n462\n00:25:34.140 --> 00:25:37.750\nAll that kernel stuff we\nsaw earlier had the kern\n\n463\n00:25:37.750 --> 00:25:40.070\nfacility attached to it, all right?\n\n464\n00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:43.089\nWe didn't necessarily see it, but it was\nthere when it was entered into the system.\n\n465\n00:25:43.089 --> 00:25:47.506\nAnd the system used that to determine\nwhere to send that message.\n\n466\n00:25:47.506 --> 00:25:53.250\nNow our default rule is that almost\neverything goes into slash var,\n\n467\n00:25:53.250 --> 00:25:55.580\nslash log slash messages.\n\n468\n00:25:55.580 --> 00:25:57.110\nAnd all bunch of the other.\n\n469\n00:25:57.110 --> 00:26:01.060\nSlash var slash log slash messages,\nso that's where everything goes.\n\n470\n00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:02.850\nBut we might wanna split that out.\n\n471\n00:26:02.850 --> 00:26:06.620\nMaybe we want the kernel\nstuff have it's own log file.\n\n472\n00:26:06.620 --> 00:26:09.970\nSo, I don't want just messages,\nmaybe I wanna create a k message and\n\n473\n00:26:09.970 --> 00:26:11.830\nhave everything for the kernel go there.\n\n474\n00:26:11.830 --> 00:26:16.690\nAnd so I could dictate that, anything sent\nto the kernel facility goes to kmessage.\n\n475\n00:26:17.930 --> 00:26:21.280\nSo that's one way we can\ndifferentiate messages.\n\n476\n00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:23.110\nMessages come in with a facility.\n\n477\n00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:25.830\nThey also come in with a severity.\n\n478\n00:26:25.830 --> 00:26:29.700\nThat's the other way we can\nmanipulate our messages.\n\n479\n00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:32.730\nWe used to reverence these with numbers,\nzero through seven.\n\n480\n00:26:32.730 --> 00:26:34.870\nNow, we reference them by name.\n\n481\n00:26:34.870 --> 00:26:39.140\nAnd there's actually some\nold names that are gone now.\n\n482\n00:26:39.140 --> 00:26:44.315\nThey're used to be error written\nall the way out, they're used to be\n\n483\n00:26:44.315 --> 00:26:50.131\nwarn which is abbreviated, and they're\nused to be, what was the other one?\n\n484\n00:26:50.131 --> 00:26:50.923\nWas it crit?\n\n485\n00:26:50.923 --> 00:26:54.196\nOne of these used to be panic, I think,\nit was emergency used to also be panic, or\n\n486\n00:26:54.196 --> 00:26:56.219\nit might have been alert\nthat used to be panic, but\n\n487\n00:26:56.219 --> 00:26:58.310\nthat's another one that's gone now too.\n\n488\n00:26:58.310 --> 00:27:02.866\nSo, if you're looking at really\nold textbooks you might see\n\n489\n00:27:02.866 --> 00:27:05.380\nan error written all the way out.\n\n490\n00:27:05.380 --> 00:27:06.050\nPanic.\n\n491\n00:27:06.050 --> 00:27:07.670\nYou might see these\nones that are gone now.\n\n492\n00:27:07.670 --> 00:27:09.870\nBut these are the ones that\nare in modern systems right here.\n\n493\n00:27:09.870 --> 00:27:11.600\nThese eight entries.\n\n494\n00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:16.440\nAnd what they are,\nare various levels of severity, danger.\n\n495\n00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:18.240\nThe stuff we need to act upon.\n\n496\n00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:19.750\nAnd they start from very benign.\n\n497\n00:27:19.750 --> 00:27:24.330\nAt the lowest level,\nwhich is actually level seven, is Debug.\n\n498\n00:27:24.330 --> 00:27:28.160\nDebug is when we're doing\ndebugging as a developer and\n\n499\n00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:30.420\nwe're saying extensive verbose output.\n\n500\n00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:35.070\nIt doesn't mean there's a problem it just\nmeans we want to see as much as we can.\n\n501\n00:27:35.070 --> 00:27:38.180\nSo those come in flagged as\ndebug oftentimes you wanna\n\n502\n00:27:38.180 --> 00:27:40.890\nfilter that out because it's so\nmuch information.\n\n503\n00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:43.650\nInfo, that's just information.\n\n504\n00:27:43.650 --> 00:27:47.390\nThere is no action to take,\nit's just letting us know something.\n\n505\n00:27:47.390 --> 00:27:50.630\nAll of those dhcp entries,\nthose were information.\n\n506\n00:27:50.630 --> 00:27:54.010\nIs there an action I need to take\nbecause I got a dhcp address?\n\n507\n00:27:54.010 --> 00:27:55.520\nNo, it worked as I expected, right?\n\n508\n00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:58.410\nSo those are just informational,\nall right?\n\n509\n00:27:58.410 --> 00:28:00.910\nNotice that would be a problem,\n\n510\n00:28:00.910 --> 00:28:05.400\nif my DHCP lease was about to expire I\nwould get a notice saying that, okay?\n\n511\n00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:08.235\nIt would then renew it, and\nhopefully it would It would be fine, but\n\n512\n00:28:08.235 --> 00:28:10.205\nif it didn't I got to notice.\n\n513\n00:28:10.205 --> 00:28:13.055\nNotice as, you probably don't\nneed to take any action but\n\n514\n00:28:13.055 --> 00:28:14.163\nwe just want you to be aware of this.\n\n515\n00:28:14.163 --> 00:28:15.782\nAll right?\n\n516\n00:28:15.782 --> 00:28:18.885\nWarning, warning means there's a problem.\n\n517\n00:28:18.885 --> 00:28:19.845\nAll right?\n\n518\n00:28:19.845 --> 00:28:23.225\nThere's a problem but you don't\nnecessarily need to do anything about it.\n\n519\n00:28:23.225 --> 00:28:24.945\nIt may just be intermittent, right?\n\n520\n00:28:24.945 --> 00:28:27.068\nI've failed to renew the DACP lease.\n\n521\n00:28:27.068 --> 00:28:30.930\nIt's okay, cuz we still have two more\ndays on it but I failed to renew it.\n\n522\n00:28:30.930 --> 00:28:32.380\nThere might be a problem.\n\n523\n00:28:32.380 --> 00:28:36.480\nSo when you see a warning, there may or\nnot be an action you need synced.\n\n524\n00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:39.930\nMaybe I was on a laptop and\nI was in a cab at the time and so,\n\n525\n00:28:39.930 --> 00:28:42.260\nyeah, there's not P server and\nthen you take action.\n\n526\n00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:47.120\nBut when I get back to the office I plug\nin, gets an address just fine, no action.\n\n527\n00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:47.650\nRight?\n\n528\n00:28:47.650 --> 00:28:50.770\nSo warnings may or may not indicate\nan action needs to be taken.\n\n529\n00:28:52.010 --> 00:28:55.040\nEverything else action needs to be taken,\nright?\n\n530\n00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:58.680\nError, error usually means that\na program crashed or malfunction.\n\n531\n00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:00.470\nTry to access a file and it wasn't there.\n\n532\n00:29:00.470 --> 00:29:01.330\nDidn't have permission.\n\n533\n00:29:01.330 --> 00:29:02.599\nSomething like that,\nthose are gonna be errors.\n\n534\n00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:04.730\nCritical.\n\n535\n00:29:04.730 --> 00:29:08.250\nThat means that something happened that\nwas so bad that the software crashed.\n\n536\n00:29:08.250 --> 00:29:10.589\nThat the software wasn't able\nto continue functioning.\n\n537\n00:29:10.589 --> 00:29:11.550\nThat it froze.\n\n538\n00:29:11.550 --> 00:29:14.790\nThat a user got kicked out of\nthe system or something like that.\n\n539\n00:29:14.790 --> 00:29:15.780\nAlert.\n\n540\n00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:17.170\nThere's a problem,\n\n541\n00:29:17.170 --> 00:29:20.470\nyou have something specific you need to\ndo if you wanna overcome that problem.\n\n542\n00:29:20.470 --> 00:29:23.911\nAll right, and if you don't do it,\nif you don't overcome that problem,\n\n543\n00:29:23.911 --> 00:29:25.810\nthe system is no longer gonna be stable.\n\n544\n00:29:26.890 --> 00:29:29.680\nAnd then the worst is emergency.\n\n545\n00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:32.250\nNow, emergency you always\nsee after the fact.\n\n546\n00:29:32.250 --> 00:29:34.230\nBecause by the time\nan emergency is generated.\n\n547\n00:29:34.230 --> 00:29:35.940\nIt means your system\nis literally unusable.\n\n548\n00:29:35.940 --> 00:29:37.630\nThe kernel is no longer able to run.\n\n549\n00:29:37.630 --> 00:29:40.650\nRight.\nThis means your computer shutdown, or\n\n550\n00:29:40.650 --> 00:29:42.190\nfrozen, or reboot.\n\n551\n00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:44.507\nOne of the other but it's not usable.\n\n552\n00:29:44.507 --> 00:29:46.670\nSo you always see\nemergency after the fact.\n\n553\n00:29:46.670 --> 00:29:48.800\nYou can't say,\nsomething looking at a weird.\n\n554\n00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:50.250\nLet me go take a log file.\n\n555\n00:29:50.250 --> 00:29:53.180\nCuz you're not able to work at that point.\n\n556\n00:29:53.180 --> 00:29:54.970\nSo, those are the different levels.\n\n557\n00:29:54.970 --> 00:29:57.840\nAnd I mentioned to Nate, hey,\nI just didn't have time to sift through\n\n558\n00:29:57.840 --> 00:30:00.330\nall the e-mails and\nstuff like that with a message.\n\n559\n00:30:00.330 --> 00:30:02.670\nWhenever I would do any\nalerting off of syslog,\n\n560\n00:30:02.670 --> 00:30:06.020\nI usually used the web interface to do it,\nI would filter it.\n\n561\n00:30:06.020 --> 00:30:08.660\nAnd I would say, you know what,\njust give me error and ire.\n\n562\n00:30:08.660 --> 00:30:10.540\nJust give me those guys right there,\n\n563\n00:30:10.540 --> 00:30:14.430\nbecause those are ones that require\naction, and I'm a man of action,\n\n564\n00:30:14.430 --> 00:30:16.820\nthat's what we all say, so [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n565\n00:30:16.820 --> 00:30:17.710\n>> All right, maybe not.\n\n566\n00:30:17.710 --> 00:30:19.630\nBut they're the ones that take action,\n\n567\n00:30:19.630 --> 00:30:22.760\nwe need to do something to fix them,\nso I wanna be aware of those.\n\n568\n00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:24.506\nIt doesn't mean that I\nignore the other ones.\n\n569\n00:30:24.506 --> 00:30:29.243\nIf I'm trying to figure out a puzzle, if\nsomething's not working and I'm not sure\n\n570\n00:30:29.243 --> 00:30:33.797\nwhy, I'm gonna expand my range and\nstart getting warnings, notices, info.\n\n571\n00:30:33.797 --> 00:30:37.660\nJust so I can try and get all the\ninformation I can to solve the problem.\n\n572\n00:30:37.660 --> 00:30:38.340\nAll right.\n\n573\n00:30:38.340 --> 00:30:41.250\nBut on a general day,\nI'm looking for the bad ones.\n\n574\n00:30:41.250 --> 00:30:44.589\nI'm looking for error and\nthe kind of those guys right there.\n\n575\n00:30:44.589 --> 00:30:45.240\n>> So, Don.\n\n576\n00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:50.410\nSo the types of logs in that are flag\nwith this facility level and\n\n577\n00:30:50.410 --> 00:30:54.190\nthis security levels,\nare they gonna be the.\n\n578\n00:30:54.190 --> 00:30:56.780\nAre they gonna be the same\nacross all the distributions or\n\n579\n00:30:56.780 --> 00:30:59.800\nare they gonna change\ndepending on what you go with?\n\n580\n00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:02.530\n>> That's the best part of syslog and\nRonnie was talking about this earlier,\n\n581\n00:31:02.530 --> 00:31:05.790\nhe goes, well you know those\nare the same as on Cisco routers.\n\n582\n00:31:05.790 --> 00:31:10.050\nAnd I said, I know,\nsyslog is a standardized environment and\n\n583\n00:31:10.050 --> 00:31:13.490\nso any system that is either using or\n\n584\n00:31:13.490 --> 00:31:17.610\nmimicking the syslog system from\nUNIX is going to follow this model.\n\n585\n00:31:17.610 --> 00:31:20.550\nAnd so,\nalmost all of your Linux distributions,\n\n586\n00:31:20.550 --> 00:31:23.820\nunless they've willfully changed it,\nwill follow this model.\n\n587\n00:31:23.820 --> 00:31:26.547\nOSX follows this model on the Mac side.\n\n588\n00:31:26.547 --> 00:31:30.090\nCisco routers, Juniper routers,\nthey follow this model too.\n\n589\n00:31:30.090 --> 00:31:33.390\nEven if you don't follow the model you\ncan usually override it to make it follow\n\n590\n00:31:33.390 --> 00:31:34.170\nthis pattern.\n\n591\n00:31:34.170 --> 00:31:37.570\nSo that does make life a lot easier\nbecause you can aggregate these logs\n\n592\n00:31:37.570 --> 00:31:42.090\ntogether and when you do that, well, you\nmight have some logs that are coming from\n\n593\n00:31:42.090 --> 00:31:45.590\nLinux boxes and Windows boxes and\nCisco firewalls and whatever.\n\n594\n00:31:45.590 --> 00:31:46.714\nAll mixed together.\n\n595\n00:31:46.714 --> 00:31:49.230\nSo, wouldn't it be nice if they\nused that common arrangement?\n\n596\n00:31:49.230 --> 00:31:50.650\nAnd for the most part, they do.\n\n597\n00:31:50.650 --> 00:31:53.991\nAll right, so when a message comes in,\nit might be flagged as something.\n\n598\n00:31:53.991 --> 00:31:56.804\nIt might be flagged as kern.info,\nall right?\n\n599\n00:31:56.804 --> 00:32:01.284\nSo, that means the facility is kernel,\nthe severity is information.\n\n600\n00:32:01.284 --> 00:32:05.027\nSo I know where it came from, or\nat least what it applies to, and\n\n601\n00:32:05.027 --> 00:32:09.540\nI know the severity level that I need\nto take action or not take action.\n\n602\n00:32:09.540 --> 00:32:11.930\nThose two pieces of\ninformation are really helpful.\n\n603\n00:32:11.930 --> 00:32:15.773\nSo when we configure syslog,\nyou'll see in here the rules they define.\n\n604\n00:32:15.773 --> 00:32:23.592\nFor example, mail.*, anything that comes\nin flagged with the mail facility,\n\n605\n00:32:23.592 --> 00:32:27.559\ndon't put it in /var/log/messages,\n\n606\n00:32:27.559 --> 00:32:33.023\ninstead put it in [BLANK\nAUDIO] /var/log/mailog.\n\n607\n00:32:33.023 --> 00:32:36.000\nPut it in a different location.\n\n608\n00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:40.202\nOr you'll see cron,\nall the cron stuff go to /var/log/cron.\n\n609\n00:32:40.202 --> 00:32:43.960\nCro.*, cron.* that means\nany severity level.\n\n610\n00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:47.520\nSo anything we're dealing\nwith the cron sub system.\n\n611\n00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:51.339\nSome of the other ones, *.emerg.\n\n612\n00:32:51.339 --> 00:32:55.879\n*.emerg that's if an emergency\nhappens from any, any source,\n\n613\n00:32:55.879 --> 00:33:00.104\nfrom any source if an emergency comes in,\nwhere do we send it?\n\n614\n00:33:00.104 --> 00:33:01.602\nAnd notice what it's got?\n\n615\n00:33:01.602 --> 00:33:02.786\nA star.\n\n616\n00:33:02.786 --> 00:33:03.790\nEverybody.\n\n617\n00:33:03.790 --> 00:33:07.740\nWe tell everybody,\nthat means it displays it on our screen.\n\n618\n00:33:07.740 --> 00:33:09.407\nWe see it, we get that information.\n\n619\n00:33:09.407 --> 00:33:11.497\nSo that we know what's going on.\n\n620\n00:33:11.497 --> 00:33:15.087\nYou'll see some of the other ones,\nuucp.news.crit,\n\n621\n00:33:15.087 --> 00:33:17.560\nhere they're combining them.\n\n622\n00:33:17.560 --> 00:33:21.990\nAnything dealing with uucp and\nnews.crit so\n\n623\n00:33:21.990 --> 00:33:26.710\nany criticals for these two systems\nare going to /var/log/spooler.\n\n624\n00:33:26.710 --> 00:33:30.460\nSo we can start to direct these things\nto different log files if you want.\n\n625\n00:33:30.460 --> 00:33:32.920\nYou don't have to,\nyou can comment these out and\n\n626\n00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:37.080\njust have everything go to\n/var/log/messages if you want.\n\n627\n00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:38.620\nAll in one place.\n\n628\n00:33:38.620 --> 00:33:40.670\nThat works.\n\n629\n00:33:40.670 --> 00:33:43.290\nOr you can break them out\nlike they're showing here.\n\n630\n00:33:43.290 --> 00:33:47.550\nAnd this is the default configuration\nfrom CentOS, I haven't manipulated this.\n\n631\n00:33:47.550 --> 00:33:49.055\nBut you'll see where\nthey do a lot of that.\n\n632\n00:33:49.055 --> 00:33:54.049\nHere, *.info, mail.none,\nthat's an important one,\n\n633\n00:33:54.049 --> 00:34:00.120\nmail.none that means don't log any\nmail stuff to /var/log/messages.\n\n634\n00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:01.685\nRemember down here we're saying mail.*.\n\n635\n00:34:01.685 --> 00:34:06.412\nmail.* says send all that\nstuff to var/log/maillog.\n\n636\n00:34:06.412 --> 00:34:11.120\nmail.none, up here, make sure those\nmessages don't make it in to this log.\n\n637\n00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:15.800\nSo they're gonna bee split off and\nin that other location.\n\n638\n00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:19.663\nAnd so, I should have that print\ndirectory, I'm in the wrong one.\n\n639\n00:34:19.663 --> 00:34:24.124\nLet me switch back to my root user.\n\n640\n00:34:27.527 --> 00:34:31.380\nSo let me get back into /var/log,\nand we'll see in here,\n\n641\n00:34:31.380 --> 00:34:35.389\nthere's maillog right there,\nand if I do a more maillog, and\n\n642\n00:34:35.389 --> 00:34:39.480\nI start to look at it,\nthere's my post fix entries.\n\n643\n00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:43.250\nI'm running post fix, it's a mail server,\nand it's logging right to here.\n\n644\n00:34:43.250 --> 00:34:45.870\nSo I can see those entries\nthat have been coming in,\n\n645\n00:34:45.870 --> 00:34:48.930\nthere they are punched in,\nin the same syslog format.\n\n646\n00:34:48.930 --> 00:34:54.104\nI mean, these are basically syslogs, they\njust been split off into separate file.\n\n647\n00:34:54.104 --> 00:34:55.089\nNice.\n\n648\n00:34:55.089 --> 00:35:01.220\nSo kind of a neat thing to do, I mentioned\nthat we wrote some scripts the other day.\n\n649\n00:35:01.220 --> 00:35:02.780\nAnd we didn't do any logging.\n\n650\n00:35:02.780 --> 00:35:04.550\nSo I wanna show you guys\nhow to do manual logging.\n\n651\n00:35:04.550 --> 00:35:06.894\nI think we're out of time for\nthis segment.\n\n652\n00:35:06.894 --> 00:35:09.360\nI've got a couple of\nthings left to talk about.\n\n653\n00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:10.800\nI wanna talk about manual logging.\n\n654\n00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:13.390\nAnd I wanna talk about sending\nyour syslogs to a remote system.\n\n655\n00:35:13.390 --> 00:35:16.290\nSo let's do this, why don't we\nstop here and take a break and\n\n656\n00:35:16.290 --> 00:35:19.185\nwhen we get back, I'll cover those,\nthat way I won't run crazy long.\n\n657\n00:35:19.185 --> 00:35:20.153\n>> [LAUGH] Sweet.\n\n658\n00:35:20.153 --> 00:35:23.173\n>> So ladies and gentleman stay tuned,\nwe'll be back in a few.\n\n659\n00:35:23.173 --> 00:35:27.963\n[SOUND] Welcome back everybody,\nso just a couple of\n\n660\n00:35:27.963 --> 00:35:33.207\nlast little bits about syslog\nthat I wanted to tackle,\n\n661\n00:35:33.207 --> 00:35:38.567\nthe first thing was if we're\nwriting our own scripts and\n\n662\n00:35:38.567 --> 00:35:45.317\nthings like that, wouldn't it be\nnice if we could log to syslog also?\n\n663\n00:35:45.317 --> 00:35:48.565\nAnd that's not a uncommon thing and\nwe might wanna generate that, so\n\n664\n00:35:48.565 --> 00:35:51.421\nI wanna show you guys how to\nmanually create syslog entries so\n\n665\n00:35:51.421 --> 00:35:54.970\nthat you can call it from your\nown scripts and software.\n\n666\n00:35:54.970 --> 00:35:57.910\nThe key component is to\nuse the logger command and\n\n667\n00:35:57.910 --> 00:35:59.960\nwe saw that in one of the configurations.\n\n668\n00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:02.300\nLogger is a part of Linux.\n\n669\n00:36:02.300 --> 00:36:04.711\nIt should be installed as part\nof your default OS, again,\n\n670\n00:36:04.711 --> 00:36:06.101\nI've never seen it not be there.\n\n671\n00:36:06.101 --> 00:36:10.070\nBut it really just takes a few\nsimple command arguments.\n\n672\n00:36:10.070 --> 00:36:11.710\nWhen you generate a log message,\n\n673\n00:36:11.710 --> 00:36:15.790\nthe content of the message can be\nprovided in the command line, or\n\n674\n00:36:15.790 --> 00:36:19.920\nit can be drawn from a file, and so\nyou'll see where you got like dash.\n\n675\n00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:23.930\nLog the specified file, but\nyou can also do other things.\n\n676\n00:36:23.930 --> 00:36:27.020\nYou provide that information and\nyou send it to a syslog server.\n\n677\n00:36:27.020 --> 00:36:30.270\nSo we can generate those\nmessages right here.\n\n678\n00:36:30.270 --> 00:36:32.350\nTwo examples of using the command,\n\n679\n00:36:32.350 --> 00:36:38.010\nthe easiest way to use it is just straight\nout to say logger followed by a message.\n\n680\n00:36:38.010 --> 00:36:46.060\nFollowed by, Script has run successfully,\nor whatever.\n\n681\n00:36:46.060 --> 00:36:49.440\nSo maybe at the end of my script,\nI put in an entry like that.\n\n682\n00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:52.675\nAnd when I run that,\nit'll create that syslog message.\n\n683\n00:36:52.675 --> 00:36:55.205\nAnd you'll remember from our scripting\nepisode that we might have several\n\n684\n00:36:55.205 --> 00:36:59.075\nbranches that we go through if we\nuse the if-then-else statements.\n\n685\n00:36:59.075 --> 00:37:04.110\nSo if a user account already exists,\nwe're gonna error out and exit.\n\n686\n00:37:04.110 --> 00:37:07.070\nAnd so, I might wanna create\na message that says that.\n\n687\n00:37:07.070 --> 00:37:11.921\nAnd so, with logger I can go a little\nbit further and I can say, logger -p,\n\n688\n00:37:11.921 --> 00:37:15.078\nand now I can specify the facility and\nseverity,\n\n689\n00:37:15.078 --> 00:37:18.389\nI might want to say that\nthis is gonna go to local1.\n\n690\n00:37:18.389 --> 00:37:22.945\nMaybe that's where I've decided I wanna\nstart storing my syslog messages, or\n\n691\n00:37:22.945 --> 00:37:24.890\nlocal0 or whatever.\n\n692\n00:37:24.890 --> 00:37:27.060\nAnd I want this one to be critical.\n\n693\n00:37:27.060 --> 00:37:28.880\nCuz we can pick whatever we want.\n\n694\n00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:34.610\nAnd then, I can go in and provide\nwhatever is, I can say, User attempted\n\n695\n00:37:34.610 --> 00:37:39.850\nto create an account that already existed.\n\n696\n00:37:41.580 --> 00:37:43.924\nThere we go.\nSo I'm just gonna punch that in and\n\n697\n00:37:43.924 --> 00:37:46.110\nthat generates the message.\n\n698\n00:37:46.110 --> 00:37:51.100\nAnd it logs it with the local0 facility\nsaying that's where I'm gonna log this too\n\n699\n00:37:51.100 --> 00:37:53.790\nand crit,\nit gives it the critical severity.\n\n700\n00:37:55.170 --> 00:38:00.460\nAnd if I tail my syslog message, and\n\n701\n00:38:00.460 --> 00:38:04.810\nI look there at the end, I can see those\ntwo entries script has run successfully\n\n702\n00:38:04.810 --> 00:38:08.590\nand user attempted to create\nan account that already existed.\n\n703\n00:38:08.590 --> 00:38:11.080\nThey're both right there in the syslogs.\n\n704\n00:38:11.080 --> 00:38:15.106\nAnd that's because I hadn't created\nany rules that said, yeah, local0,\n\n705\n00:38:15.106 --> 00:38:19.028\nthat goes to this other file or crit that\ngoes to a different file or whatever.\n\n706\n00:38:19.028 --> 00:38:22.796\nSo they're just going right here and\nI can see them and\n\n707\n00:38:22.796 --> 00:38:27.660\nnotice that the local0.crit,\nthat doesn't show up in here.\n\n708\n00:38:27.660 --> 00:38:31.260\nThat's used when the message is logged\nto place in the right location and\n\n709\n00:38:31.260 --> 00:38:32.430\nthen it's stripped out.\n\n710\n00:38:32.430 --> 00:38:33.840\nSo it's kinda gone now.\n\n711\n00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:38.173\nSo I would need to make sure I had\nthose rules in place before I started\n\n712\n00:38:38.173 --> 00:38:40.084\ngenerating these messages.\n\n713\n00:38:40.084 --> 00:38:45.081\nSo that's two examples, and so\nyou can just use that logger command and\n\n714\n00:38:45.081 --> 00:38:49.000\nput that into your scripts and\nlog all throughout it.\n\n715\n00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:52.160\nSo you can log successes and failures\nas part of your error checking and\n\n716\n00:38:52.160 --> 00:38:54.230\nyour routines as you move\nthrough your branches.\n\n717\n00:38:54.230 --> 00:38:56.830\nAnd now you got a record\nof how that script ended.\n\n718\n00:38:56.830 --> 00:39:01.220\nVery useful, you can collect\ninformation on it and it's very handy.\n\n719\n00:39:01.220 --> 00:39:02.110\n>> Nice.\n\n720\n00:39:02.110 --> 00:39:06.847\n>> The other thing I said was, if you got\none server, this is all fine and good.\n\n721\n00:39:06.847 --> 00:39:09.690\nBut if you've got 100 servers,\n\n722\n00:39:09.690 --> 00:39:13.870\nnobody want's to go and\nsift through all this junk.\n\n723\n00:39:13.870 --> 00:39:14.446\nAt least I don't.\n\n724\n00:39:14.446 --> 00:39:18.649\nSo what we would rather do,\nsift it through 100 different server so\n\n725\n00:39:18.649 --> 00:39:22.110\nwould it be nice if we get\naggregate it all into one place?\n\n726\n00:39:22.110 --> 00:39:23.394\nI do this all the time.\n\n727\n00:39:23.394 --> 00:39:26.849\nWhat I like to do is there are a number\nof third party syslog servers that\n\n728\n00:39:26.849 --> 00:39:27.930\nare out there.\n\n729\n00:39:27.930 --> 00:39:28.730\nThey can take this and\n\n730\n00:39:28.730 --> 00:39:33.470\nstored into an SQL database, and then\nyou can just query against the database.\n\n731\n00:39:33.470 --> 00:39:36.500\nI like that cuz you can let\ndatabases grow to be massive,\n\n732\n00:39:36.500 --> 00:39:41.700\nyou can have years of syslog data for\nhundred of servers all in one database.\n\n733\n00:39:41.700 --> 00:39:43.380\nYou can query against whatever you want.\n\n734\n00:39:43.380 --> 00:39:47.490\nThat's really useful if you're\ntrying to do pattern analysis.\n\n735\n00:39:47.490 --> 00:39:51.730\nIf I have a server crash, I might say,\nhas it crashed this way before?\n\n736\n00:39:51.730 --> 00:39:53.928\nLet me find common messages like this.\n\n737\n00:39:53.928 --> 00:39:58.031\nIf it has, show me all the crashes\nover the last six months.\n\n738\n00:39:58.031 --> 00:39:59.587\nIs there a pattern?\n\n739\n00:39:59.587 --> 00:40:01.924\nAnd some people don't see\na lot of value in that.\n\n740\n00:40:01.924 --> 00:40:06.290\nI know I've found more than one instance,\nlike with some Cisco switches,\n\n741\n00:40:06.290 --> 00:40:10.860\nwhere there was a particular failure\nthat was happening every 30 days.\n\n742\n00:40:10.860 --> 00:40:13.020\nAnd I wouldn't have known that\nif I didn't have the pattern.\n\n743\n00:40:13.020 --> 00:40:16.040\nI found a memory leak where memory\nutilization was increasing, and\n\n744\n00:40:16.040 --> 00:40:18.640\nit took 30 days for the crash to occur.\n\n745\n00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:22.140\nAnd when I saw that pattern,\nit would crash, reboot, and\n\n746\n00:40:22.140 --> 00:40:24.750\nthen be fine,\ncuz memory got flushed, right?\n\n747\n00:40:24.750 --> 00:40:28.130\nSo that was, my indicator was, hey,\nthis problem is happening now.\n\n748\n00:40:28.130 --> 00:40:30.170\nI didn't know how long\nit had been happening,\n\n749\n00:40:30.170 --> 00:40:32.090\nbecause the system would reboot,\nand it was fine.\n\n750\n00:40:32.090 --> 00:40:33.820\nAnd if it happened in\nthe middle of the night,\n\n751\n00:40:33.820 --> 00:40:35.320\nI might not know it happened at all.\n\n752\n00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:39.410\nBut I was remote syslogging it, and so I\nwas able to go into our central repository\n\n753\n00:40:39.410 --> 00:40:43.310\nand find it, and look back historically\nand see that it had been going on.\n\n754\n00:40:43.310 --> 00:40:47.020\nEver since a particular update had\nbeen applied to that switch, and\n\n755\n00:40:47.020 --> 00:40:50.105\nsure enough,\nthat update had the memory leak bug in it.\n\n756\n00:40:50.105 --> 00:40:53.030\n[INAUDIBLE], problem solved, right?\n\n757\n00:40:53.030 --> 00:40:56.127\nSo that's the kind of thing we can\ndo when we have historical data.\n\n758\n00:40:56.127 --> 00:40:58.042\nNow, how do you set that up?\n\n759\n00:40:58.042 --> 00:41:03.501\nWell, any syslog server can\nbe a central repository.\n\n760\n00:41:03.501 --> 00:41:06.749\nAny syslog server can receive\nsyslog messages form outside,\n\n761\n00:41:06.749 --> 00:41:09.570\nas well as send it's own messages out,\nokay?\n\n762\n00:41:09.570 --> 00:41:12.350\nSo let's say that I want\nto be the syslog server.\n\n763\n00:41:12.350 --> 00:41:15.390\nIf I want this host to\nreceive syslog messages from\n\n764\n00:41:15.390 --> 00:41:20.415\nother hosts that are out there, all I need\nto do is I just need to make sure that\n\n765\n00:41:20.415 --> 00:41:23.790\nsyslog is listening on UDP port 514.\n\n766\n00:41:23.790 --> 00:41:28.800\nWe saw that in the rsyslog.d config, and\nI just need to double check it here.\n\n767\n00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:31.450\nNow, if we're running a software firewall,\nwe'll need to update it there.\n\n768\n00:41:31.450 --> 00:41:33.370\nWe'll see that in the security episode.\n\n769\n00:41:33.370 --> 00:41:37.960\nBut just to make sure that\nsyslog is running, well,\n\n770\n00:41:37.960 --> 00:41:39.980\nthat's a pretty straightforward step.\n\n771\n00:41:39.980 --> 00:41:43.573\nI need to go into /etc, and\n\n772\n00:41:43.573 --> 00:41:48.270\nI ended up edit this services file.\n\n773\n00:41:49.900 --> 00:41:53.830\nAnd in here, we're gonna see a lot\nof basic services that are built\n\n774\n00:41:53.830 --> 00:41:57.420\ninto our system like FTP,\nTelnet, and so on.\n\n775\n00:41:57.420 --> 00:41:59.630\nSome of these might be turned off.\n\n776\n00:41:59.630 --> 00:42:02.680\nYou'll see a hash mark before them,\nsome might be running.\n\n777\n00:42:02.680 --> 00:42:08.580\nAnd I can go through here, and\nI can locate syslog, it's buried in here.\n\n778\n00:42:08.580 --> 00:42:09.920\nIt's sorted by port number.\n\n779\n00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:13.210\nSo if I just go down until I find 514,\nactually, I'm not gonna see it.\n\n780\n00:42:13.210 --> 00:42:15.180\nLet me just do a search.\n\n781\n00:42:17.610 --> 00:42:18.555\nThere we go.\n\n782\n00:42:18.555 --> 00:42:21.950\nSo when you're doing vy,\nyou can do a forward slash to search for\n\n783\n00:42:21.950 --> 00:42:24.390\nsomething, so I just search for\nsyslog, and here it is.\n\n784\n00:42:24.390 --> 00:42:28.022\nSo here's the syslog server,\nand it's on 514/udp.\n\n785\n00:42:28.022 --> 00:42:32.090\nThere's no pound symbol or hash mark\nbefore it, so it's not coming out.\n\n786\n00:42:32.090 --> 00:42:33.900\nThat means I'm running so slow.\n\n787\n00:42:33.900 --> 00:42:36.070\nAgain, it's listening on that port.\n\n788\n00:42:36.070 --> 00:42:40.680\nListening on that port means anybody could\nsend to me, and I'd get that message.\n\n789\n00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:42.640\nAgain, if you have a firewall,\nyou got to configure it there,\n\n790\n00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:46.060\ntoo, but the server itself is geared\nup and ready to receive these messages.\n\n791\n00:42:48.110 --> 00:42:50.670\nThen I just need to go\nto my other servers.\n\n792\n00:42:50.670 --> 00:42:53.754\nAnd on my other servers, I need to tell\nthem, hey, when you generate log messages,\n\n793\n00:42:53.754 --> 00:42:58.510\ndon't just send them local,\nalso send them over to this guy, okay?\n\n794\n00:42:58.510 --> 00:43:02.460\nAnd we do that in our\nsyslog configuration file.\n\n795\n00:43:02.460 --> 00:43:09.036\nSo if I get back into rsyslog.conf, so\n\n796\n00:43:09.036 --> 00:43:15.616\nI'm editing /etc/rsyslog.conf,\n\n797\n00:43:15.616 --> 00:43:18.417\nand I go in here.\n\n798\n00:43:18.417 --> 00:43:20.870\nThis is where I saw all those rules.\n\n799\n00:43:20.870 --> 00:43:27.050\nAnd in the rules, see how we say like\nlocal7.* goes to /var/log/boot.log, right?\n\n800\n00:43:27.050 --> 00:43:30.080\nThat's Red Hat using local7 for that.\n\n801\n00:43:30.080 --> 00:43:31.770\nWe can add in our own rule.\n\n802\n00:43:31.770 --> 00:43:34.210\nIt doesn't really matter where we put it,\nbut\n\n803\n00:43:34.210 --> 00:43:39.160\nwe can insert our own rule in here, and\nwe can specify an alternate location.\n\n804\n00:43:39.160 --> 00:43:42.311\nSo I might wanna say,\nsend everything, *.*.\n\n805\n00:43:42.311 --> 00:43:48.710\nAny facility, any severity,\nI wanna send all of that.\n\n806\n00:43:48.710 --> 00:43:55.810\nAnd for a destination, I just specify at,\nand then the host name, if I know it.\n\n807\n00:43:55.810 --> 00:44:02.670\nSo if it's logserv.itpro.tv,\nI can specify it right there, okay?\n\n808\n00:44:02.670 --> 00:44:08.495\nAnd now, every time I receive a syslog\nmessage, I will send it to that server.\n\n809\n00:44:08.495 --> 00:44:14.600\nAnd a default support 514, so\nI could throw the name of the column 514.\n\n810\n00:44:14.600 --> 00:44:17.060\nBut if we've used a custom port,\nI have to put that in.\n\n811\n00:44:17.060 --> 00:44:19.550\nIf you used a standard port,\nyou can just leave that off.\n\n812\n00:44:19.550 --> 00:44:22.350\nYou don't even have to do the rest of it,\nokay?\n\n813\n00:44:22.350 --> 00:44:23.640\nSo we can punch that in, and\n\n814\n00:44:23.640 --> 00:44:27.060\nnow, every message I receive is\ngonna be exported to that guy.\n\n815\n00:44:27.060 --> 00:44:32.620\nNow, personally,\nI don't like using DNS names just because,\n\n816\n00:44:32.620 --> 00:44:36.780\nwhat if your syslog message is telling\nyou the DNS server isn't working?\n\n817\n00:44:36.780 --> 00:44:39.400\nSo in that case,\nyour name lookup is not gonna work.\n\n818\n00:44:39.400 --> 00:44:42.070\nSo I like to do IP addresses personally.\n\n819\n00:44:42.070 --> 00:44:48.329\nSo I might say a server like this,\nand so I just say @10.1.10.4.\n\n820\n00:44:48.329 --> 00:44:48.950\nAnd now,\n\n821\n00:44:48.950 --> 00:44:53.790\nany syslog message that I generate\nwill also be sent to that IP address.\n\n822\n00:44:53.790 --> 00:44:57.090\nAnd again, I can do a port\nnumber if wanna be certain, but\n\n823\n00:44:57.090 --> 00:44:58.410\nnow it's gonna off load it.\n\n824\n00:44:58.410 --> 00:45:02.500\nSo that ability, the ability to send our\nsyslog messages to our remote system,\n\n825\n00:45:02.500 --> 00:45:06.330\nit's built-in, it's native,\nwe just have to add a rule for it.\n\n826\n00:45:06.330 --> 00:45:09.160\nAnd I think there's actually\nan example in here somewhere.\n\n827\n00:45:09.160 --> 00:45:11.370\nThere is, down at the very bottom.\n\n828\n00:45:11.370 --> 00:45:14.280\nYeah, here they show *.*,\nthey do the double at,\n\n829\n00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:17.390\nwhich you don't really have to do,\nremote-host:514.\n\n830\n00:45:17.390 --> 00:45:21.290\nSo they're just kinda showing it\nright there, name/ip and port.\n\n831\n00:45:21.290 --> 00:45:23.190\nAnd see how it says the port is optional?\n\n832\n00:45:23.190 --> 00:45:26.150\nIf you've already got, or if it's\nthe default port, it just knows it and\n\n833\n00:45:26.150 --> 00:45:27.890\nwill use it, so there you go.\n\n834\n00:45:27.890 --> 00:45:31.900\nThere are a few other things you\nmight want to tweak like retry's.\n\n835\n00:45:31.900 --> 00:45:38.585\nIf it fails, do you want it to retry, and\nthe default is it will retry infinitely.\n\n836\n00:45:38.585 --> 00:45:42.625\nSo it's gonna try really hard to\nget that message over there, but\n\n837\n00:45:42.625 --> 00:45:44.030\nyou may not want that.\n\n838\n00:45:44.030 --> 00:45:46.990\nYou may wanna set a limit,\nit just depends.\n\n839\n00:45:46.990 --> 00:45:51.510\n>> So Don, this might go a little above\nand beyond of what we're discussing right\n\n840\n00:45:51.510 --> 00:45:54.630\nhere, but so there's no, often,\noccasion in any of this.\n\n841\n00:45:54.630 --> 00:45:57.520\nSo it's gonna be collecting\nlogs from anybody or\n\n842\n00:45:57.520 --> 00:46:00.650\nanything that's spitting these\nlogs out on that port number.\n\n843\n00:46:01.730 --> 00:46:05.320\nI assume there is a way where\nit It can reject certain logs or\n\n844\n00:46:05.320 --> 00:46:09.200\nonly listen from certain servers or\nsomething.\n\n845\n00:46:09.200 --> 00:46:13.917\nI mean, I guess you could just flood this\npoor guy with just a ton garbage, right?\n\n846\n00:46:13.917 --> 00:46:18.121\n>> You could, and the short answer is no,\nthere is no way to prevent that, right?\n\n847\n00:46:18.121 --> 00:46:22.827\nSyslog is very old and has been around a\nvery long time, and it is very simple, so\n\n848\n00:46:22.827 --> 00:46:25.480\nit doesn't have authentication.\n\n849\n00:46:25.480 --> 00:46:28.327\nSo if you wanna prevent that\nscenario that you're describing,\n\n850\n00:46:28.327 --> 00:46:30.501\nyou usually use your\nsoftware firewall to do it.\n\n851\n00:46:30.501 --> 00:46:33.087\nSo if I have IP tables or whatever,\n\n852\n00:46:33.087 --> 00:46:38.541\nanybody who sends a login here is\ngonna have connect to me on port 514.\n\n853\n00:46:38.541 --> 00:46:42.777\nAnd so I can create a rule that says,\nonly this IP address, and this IP address,\n\n854\n00:46:42.777 --> 00:46:45.750\nand this IP address can\ncommunicate to me on 514, and\n\n855\n00:46:45.750 --> 00:46:48.490\nyou filter the traffic\nat the network level.\n\n856\n00:46:48.490 --> 00:46:53.373\nSyslog was written back in the day when\nnetworks were a happy place before it\n\n857\n00:46:53.373 --> 00:46:59.096\nbecame the wild west that it is right now,\nso yeah, it just doesn't have that.\n\n858\n00:46:59.096 --> 00:47:01.667\n>> I see, I see, thanks.\n\n859\n00:47:01.667 --> 00:47:04.266\n>> All right, and\nthere are some other replacements for\n\n860\n00:47:04.266 --> 00:47:07.790\nsyslog that are out there,\nthat have more advanced functionality, but\n\n861\n00:47:07.790 --> 00:47:10.870\nthey're not as generally accepted and\nconsistent as syslog.\n\n862\n00:47:13.050 --> 00:47:16.580\nAll right, so\nit wants me to save that there.\n\n863\n00:47:16.580 --> 00:47:18.350\nSo now when I generate my syslog messages,\n\n864\n00:47:18.350 --> 00:47:20.550\nI'm gonna be sending them\nto that remote host also.\n\n865\n00:47:20.550 --> 00:47:24.090\nAnd that remote host, I think it is\nactually running a syslog server.\n\n866\n00:47:24.090 --> 00:47:25.330\nI can't remember, maybe.\n\n867\n00:47:25.330 --> 00:47:28.425\nThat's my monitor server, so it might be.\n\n868\n00:47:28.425 --> 00:47:30.650\nIf that other server out\nthere isn't a syslog server,\n\n869\n00:47:30.650 --> 00:47:33.160\nthese messages are just gonna\nbalance off and not mean anything.\n\n870\n00:47:34.700 --> 00:47:37.605\nAnother thing to be aware of,\nbuilding up what you said, Nate.\n\n871\n00:47:37.605 --> 00:47:40.770\nSyslog messages are sent unencrypted, and\n\n872\n00:47:40.770 --> 00:47:44.960\nthey can contain sensitive data, their\nlog messages about all sorts of things.\n\n873\n00:47:44.960 --> 00:47:46.451\nEspecially if you're doing debugging,\n\n874\n00:47:46.451 --> 00:47:48.374\nthere can be a lot of sensitive\ninformation in there.\n\n875\n00:47:48.374 --> 00:47:53.115\nSo you may wanna combine syslog\nwith SSH tunnels or IPSec or\n\n876\n00:47:53.115 --> 00:47:56.906\nsomething to encrypt\nthe traffic in transit.\n\n877\n00:47:56.906 --> 00:47:59.758\nA syslog does not encrypt the messages for\nyou.\n\n878\n00:47:59.758 --> 00:48:01.429\nSo be aware of that.\n\n879\n00:48:01.429 --> 00:48:03.658\n>> Nice.\n\n880\n00:48:03.658 --> 00:48:04.930\nNot bad.\n\n881\n00:48:04.930 --> 00:48:09.005\n>> All right, I think that's\nall that I've got on syslog.\n\n882\n00:48:09.005 --> 00:48:10.432\nYeah, that's about it.\n\n883\n00:48:10.432 --> 00:48:13.830\nAll right, so,\nsyslog is obviously an essential service.\n\n884\n00:48:13.830 --> 00:48:17.730\nWe need that for logging so\nwe know what is going on, on our system.\n\n885\n00:48:17.730 --> 00:48:25.081\nAnother service that is\nconsidered is the MTA,\n\n886\n00:48:25.081 --> 00:48:29.505\nor the Mail Transfer Agent.\n\n887\n00:48:29.505 --> 00:48:31.907\n>> This can be my one victory for\nthe series.\n\n888\n00:48:31.907 --> 00:48:32.825\n>> [LAUGH] I got him!\n\n889\n00:48:32.825 --> 00:48:33.487\n>> But I'm gonna take it.\n\n890\n00:48:33.487 --> 00:48:35.266\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] All right.\n\n891\n00:48:35.266 --> 00:48:39.706\nSo the MTAs so they're software\nthat's designed to handle email, and\n\n892\n00:48:39.706 --> 00:48:44.664\nmost of us think of that in terms of SMTP,\nthe simple mail transport protocol and\n\n893\n00:48:44.664 --> 00:48:47.530\nthat is typically what an MTA does.\n\n894\n00:48:47.530 --> 00:48:51.740\nAlmost every Linux distribution\nrelationships not only with an NTA.\n\n895\n00:48:51.740 --> 00:48:54.030\nNot only installed, but active.\n\n896\n00:48:54.030 --> 00:48:56.980\nAnd they set it up that way not so\nthat the server can relay and be and\n\n897\n00:48:56.980 --> 00:49:01.590\nemail server, but so that the server\nitself can generate email messages.\n\n898\n00:49:01.590 --> 00:49:04.700\nYou might want that server to send\nyou an email when an event happens.\n\n899\n00:49:04.700 --> 00:49:06.330\nAnd so it runs it's own NTA.\n\n900\n00:49:06.330 --> 00:49:07.610\nSo it can do that.\n\n901\n00:49:07.610 --> 00:49:12.840\nNow, we can take it a step further and add\nfull mail server functionality, we can add\n\n902\n00:49:12.840 --> 00:49:18.040\nPOP3 and IMAP4, web-based email, we can\nadd all sorts of stuff to it, right?\n\n903\n00:49:18.040 --> 00:49:21.785\nBut the basic MTA Serves\nreally just one purpose,\n\n904\n00:49:21.785 --> 00:49:27.495\nto allow somebody to send email, and\nit's fairly basic and fairly simple.\n\n905\n00:49:27.495 --> 00:49:31.247\nThere are four main MTAs that\nyou'll see out there today.\n\n906\n00:49:31.247 --> 00:49:36.384\nThere's really one that kind of\nis the Mac daddy of them all,\n\n907\n00:49:36.384 --> 00:49:39.422\nto use the technical term, right?\n\n908\n00:49:39.422 --> 00:49:43.064\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, when it comes to MTAs,\n\n909\n00:49:43.064 --> 00:49:46.350\npostfix is the most common one.\n\n910\n00:49:46.350 --> 00:49:48.490\nPostfix, you see it on a lot of systems.\n\n911\n00:49:48.490 --> 00:49:51.380\nIn the Red Hat world,\nit is the default one.\n\n912\n00:49:51.380 --> 00:49:53.580\nBut there are others that are out there.\n\n913\n00:49:53.580 --> 00:49:58.200\nThe four main ones, the ones that\nyou may see on the exam, are Qmail,\n\n914\n00:49:58.200 --> 00:50:02.580\nPostfix, Sendmail and Exim, okay.\n\n915\n00:50:02.580 --> 00:50:04.200\nYou need to be familiar with all four.\n\n916\n00:50:04.200 --> 00:50:05.870\nNow don't panic, right.\n\n917\n00:50:05.870 --> 00:50:07.861\nIn the exam objectives it says,\n\n918\n00:50:07.861 --> 00:50:11.932\nyou need to have familiarity with\nthese four not configuration.\n\n919\n00:50:11.932 --> 00:50:14.323\nIn other words, they don't want you\nto know how to configure these,\n\n920\n00:50:14.323 --> 00:50:16.632\nthey just want you to be familiar\nwith the fact that they exist, and\n\n921\n00:50:16.632 --> 00:50:18.384\nthat there are differences\nbetween the distros.\n\n922\n00:50:18.384 --> 00:50:24.300\nSo what I did is in my notes, I put\na URL to the official site of all four.\n\n923\n00:50:24.300 --> 00:50:27.290\nSo you can jump over to their site,\nlearn a little bit more about them.\n\n924\n00:50:27.290 --> 00:50:32.020\nBut I also put my own personal opinion in\nhere, now don't, that's not on the exam.\n\n925\n00:50:32.020 --> 00:50:34.025\nThis is literally Don's opinion.\n\n926\n00:50:34.025 --> 00:50:38.390\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So my opinion of each, like Qmail.\n\n927\n00:50:38.390 --> 00:50:40.960\nIf you want great performance.\n\n928\n00:50:40.960 --> 00:50:45.390\nIf you want a high performance\nemail server, Qmail is the best.\n\n929\n00:50:45.390 --> 00:50:45.990\nAll right.\n\n930\n00:50:45.990 --> 00:50:49.290\nUnfortunately, the developers\nabandoned it a long time ago,\n\n931\n00:50:49.290 --> 00:50:51.160\nit's something like eight or\nnine years ago.\n\n932\n00:50:51.160 --> 00:50:56.150\nThey stopped updating it, it's basically\ndead as far as development is concerned.\n\n933\n00:50:56.150 --> 00:51:00.290\nYou do see a lot of hot fixes and\npatches release for it and\n\n934\n00:51:00.290 --> 00:51:05.920\nthe problem with that is two servers\nrunning qmail today might be very,\n\n935\n00:51:05.920 --> 00:51:09.730\nvery different based on the hot fixes and\npatches that had been applied to it.\n\n936\n00:51:09.730 --> 00:51:12.620\nSo, Qmail has that kind of issue to it,\n\n937\n00:51:12.620 --> 00:51:17.060\nthat it's just not as consistent because\nit is no longer actively being supported.\n\n938\n00:51:17.060 --> 00:51:20.700\nIt's great for performance, if you're\nlooking for a high performance system.\n\n939\n00:51:20.700 --> 00:51:25.300\nBut you've gotta be ready to maintain\nit yourself as far as editing code,\n\n940\n00:51:25.300 --> 00:51:28.580\ndoing quality checks and stuff like that.\n\n941\n00:51:28.580 --> 00:51:30.080\nI don't recommend Qmail.\n\n942\n00:51:30.080 --> 00:51:32.610\nI used to back in the day,\nbut not anymore.\n\n943\n00:51:34.340 --> 00:51:37.610\nPostFix, that's the one that\nwe see in Red Hat and stuff.\n\n944\n00:51:37.610 --> 00:51:38.950\nIt's very feature-rich.\n\n945\n00:51:38.950 --> 00:51:40.510\nIt's pretty good for performance.\n\n946\n00:51:40.510 --> 00:51:46.578\nIt's a good balance of features and\nperformance but it's kind of complex.\n\n947\n00:51:46.578 --> 00:51:50.390\nIf you wanna do some of the more advanced\nstuff with it, the configuration file for\n\n948\n00:51:50.390 --> 00:51:51.750\nit is really big.\n\n949\n00:51:51.750 --> 00:51:52.900\nAnd there's a lot of stuff in there.\n\n950\n00:51:52.900 --> 00:51:54.900\nIf you know what you're\ndoing it's a breeze.\n\n951\n00:51:54.900 --> 00:51:56.220\nBut if you don't know what you're doing,\n\n952\n00:51:56.220 --> 00:51:59.520\nit's not one of those that you can just\nstumble blindly through and configure.\n\n953\n00:51:59.520 --> 00:52:01.510\nYou really need to have\nsome kind of guidance.\n\n954\n00:52:01.510 --> 00:52:05.880\nAnd there's entire books out there on\npostfix, it's a very powerful system.\n\n955\n00:52:05.880 --> 00:52:11.100\nAll right, send mail,\nsend mail used to be the default,\n\n956\n00:52:11.100 --> 00:52:14.120\nevery system ran send mail,\nthat's what you could expect.\n\n957\n00:52:14.120 --> 00:52:20.990\nSend mail was the guy that was out there,\nbut send mail had some issues, okay?\n\n958\n00:52:20.990 --> 00:52:24.310\nSeveral years ago it had some high\nvisibility security exploits.\n\n959\n00:52:24.310 --> 00:52:26.120\nI mean really, really bad ones.\n\n960\n00:52:26.120 --> 00:52:26.980\nThe worst kind.\n\n961\n00:52:26.980 --> 00:52:29.730\nAnd so, it has some bad security exploits.\n\n962\n00:52:29.730 --> 00:52:32.550\nIt has some stability issues where\nit crashed under a high load.\n\n963\n00:52:32.550 --> 00:52:34.160\nIt has some negative stuff.\n\n964\n00:52:34.160 --> 00:52:34.750\nAll right.\n\n965\n00:52:34.750 --> 00:52:36.930\nNow, it's come a long way since then.\n\n966\n00:52:36.930 --> 00:52:37.820\nIt's been updated.\n\n967\n00:52:37.820 --> 00:52:38.650\nIt's been patched.\n\n968\n00:52:38.650 --> 00:52:39.578\nIt runs really well now.\n\n969\n00:52:39.578 --> 00:52:44.317\nIt's very secure now, but\nonce you get that bad experience,\n\n970\n00:52:44.317 --> 00:52:48.065\nthat bad PR, it kinda lasts,\nit sticks around.\n\n971\n00:52:48.065 --> 00:52:50.666\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And so, a lot of vendors have not gone\n\n972\n00:52:50.666 --> 00:52:53.790\nback, they moved away from\nSan Mail when it freaked out.\n\n973\n00:52:53.790 --> 00:52:55.860\nAnd then they just\nhaven't gone back again.\n\n974\n00:52:55.860 --> 00:52:58.770\nSo Sendmail, the developers there,\nthey're gonna have to really come up with\n\n975\n00:52:58.770 --> 00:53:01.800\nsomething creative and\nexciting to get people to move back to it.\n\n976\n00:53:01.800 --> 00:53:05.030\nBut in the meantime,\nmost distributions have moved away.\n\n977\n00:53:05.030 --> 00:53:07.810\nNow there are some that still\nuse it as the default one.\n\n978\n00:53:07.810 --> 00:53:09.570\nAnd there's some that have gone back.\n\n979\n00:53:09.570 --> 00:53:13.480\nBut the bigger ones like Red Hat,\nstill using Postfix.\n\n980\n00:53:13.480 --> 00:53:16.090\nWithout any plans on\ngoing back to send mail.\n\n981\n00:53:16.090 --> 00:53:19.075\nNow, there's actually kind of\na nice thing about Postfix.\n\n982\n00:53:19.075 --> 00:53:23.985\nPostfix has an emulation layer to it where\nit will emulate all of the API calls and\n\n983\n00:53:23.985 --> 00:53:26.343\nsystem calls that send mail handles.\n\n984\n00:53:26.343 --> 00:53:29.607\nSo if you have software specifically\nwritten for send mail, it'll work\n\n985\n00:53:29.607 --> 00:53:33.030\njust fine with Postfix and that was part\nof the secret with the Postfix guys,\n\n986\n00:53:33.030 --> 00:53:35.512\nthey said if we're gonna\nmake this thing successful.\n\n987\n00:53:35.512 --> 00:53:40.255\nIf we can emulate Sendmail, that takes\naway one barrier for entry and so\n\n988\n00:53:40.255 --> 00:53:44.380\npeople were able to move to\nPostfix really easy, right?\n\n989\n00:53:44.380 --> 00:53:47.910\nAnd then Postfix has its own API codes and\nstuff that it uses but\n\n990\n00:53:47.910 --> 00:53:51.480\nit still supports the Sendmail and so\nyou have this backwards compatibility.\n\n991\n00:53:51.480 --> 00:53:55.160\nThey call that the Sendmail\nemulation layer and\n\n992\n00:53:55.160 --> 00:53:57.510\nit's just that ability to\nreceive those commands.\n\n993\n00:53:57.510 --> 00:53:59.330\nNow I don't mean\nthe command line commands,\n\n994\n00:53:59.330 --> 00:54:01.710\nI mean the software calls\nthat programs make.\n\n995\n00:54:01.710 --> 00:54:03.007\nThe command line commands are different.\n\n996\n00:54:04.921 --> 00:54:08.946\nAll right, so Sendmail, it's stable and\nmature, but that's security history,\n\n997\n00:54:08.946 --> 00:54:11.400\nthat's really what draws it back.\n\n998\n00:54:11.400 --> 00:54:13.170\nAnd then Exim is the last one.\n\n999\n00:54:13.170 --> 00:54:15.990\nAnd Exim, it is feature rich.\n\n1000\n00:54:15.990 --> 00:54:19.490\nIt is, I mean, it's got more features than\nany of the other ones that are available.\n\n1001\n00:54:19.490 --> 00:54:23.550\nIt's got all sorts of really cool stuff,\nespecially in the areas of security.\n\n1002\n00:54:23.550 --> 00:54:26.590\nIt's got neat digital signing\nfunctionality and stuff like that.\n\n1003\n00:54:26.590 --> 00:54:27.440\nReally, really cool.\n\n1004\n00:54:27.440 --> 00:54:30.820\nIf you want a system that has\nall the bells and whistles.\n\n1005\n00:54:30.820 --> 00:54:32.270\nExim is the one for you.\n\n1006\n00:54:32.270 --> 00:54:33.560\nOkay.\n\n1007\n00:54:33.560 --> 00:54:35.910\nBut it's a bit of performance dog.\n\n1008\n00:54:35.910 --> 00:54:39.150\nIf you're running a small environment,\nif you've got just a few hundred users, or\n\n1009\n00:54:39.150 --> 00:54:40.720\nwhatever, Exim is great.\n\n1010\n00:54:40.720 --> 00:54:46.450\nBut if you've got tens of thousands of\nusers, XM it requires a lot of resources.\n\n1011\n00:54:46.450 --> 00:54:49.640\nSo it's not as efficient as\nthe other guys that are out there.\n\n1012\n00:54:49.640 --> 00:54:52.136\nNow, if you're an email company and that's\nyour speciality, you just deal with that.\n\n1013\n00:54:52.136 --> 00:54:53.739\nYou're like, hey, I need those features.\n\n1014\n00:54:53.739 --> 00:54:55.660\nSo Exim's the way to go.\n\n1015\n00:54:55.660 --> 00:54:56.420\nI'll deal with it.\n\n1016\n00:54:56.420 --> 00:54:57.940\nI'll buy more servers, I'll do that.\n\n1017\n00:54:57.940 --> 00:54:58.610\nRight?\n\n1018\n00:54:58.610 --> 00:55:02.990\nBut if you're your average small or medium\nbusiness Well, small and medium businesses\n\n1019\n00:55:02.990 --> 00:55:06.230\nprobably don't have enough employees to\nmatter so exit would probably be fine.\n\n1020\n00:55:06.230 --> 00:55:08.980\nBut if you're an enterprise,\nyou probably don't want to go crazy on\n\n1021\n00:55:08.980 --> 00:55:12.970\nhardware support for mail system when\nyou could just go to post-fox and\n\n1022\n00:55:12.970 --> 00:55:15.020\nit'll work just fine on\nreally low-end hardware.\n\n1023\n00:55:15.020 --> 00:55:20.730\nSo, that's what most people do and that's\nwhy Postfix is the most popular one.\n\n1024\n00:55:20.730 --> 00:55:24.129\nSo when you're out there, Postfix is what\nyou're gonna bump into a lot of the time.\n\n1025\n00:55:25.460 --> 00:55:30.960\nNow keep in mind, that's all my opinion,\nokay, and take that with a grain of salt.\n\n1026\n00:55:30.960 --> 00:55:34.550\nYou might find some people out there that\nsay, well, if you properly tune Exim, it\n\n1027\n00:55:34.550 --> 00:55:39.510\ncan outperform by several thousand emails\nper second, and they might be right.\n\n1028\n00:55:39.510 --> 00:55:42.490\nThey probably are right,\nwho knows, but in my experience,\n\n1029\n00:55:42.490 --> 00:55:44.030\nthis is how it is between the four.\n\n1030\n00:55:44.030 --> 00:55:47.610\nSo, I included links on them all, so\nyou can kind of go in and get a chance.\n\n1031\n00:55:47.610 --> 00:55:51.740\nChance to see sorta like Qmail, and boy,\n\n1032\n00:55:51.740 --> 00:55:54.150\nlet me tell you the website for\nthese guys.\n\n1033\n00:55:54.150 --> 00:55:57.125\nAll of them, the websites are pretty bad.\n\n1034\n00:55:57.125 --> 00:56:00.280\n[LAUGH] And they're not website people.\n\n1035\n00:56:00.280 --> 00:56:01.002\n>> Right.\n>> Right?\n\n1036\n00:56:01.002 --> 00:56:04.681\nThese people are, or people that\nare developing Mail server software.\n\n1037\n00:56:04.681 --> 00:56:09.140\nSo the websites are all very, very basic,\nbut it'll tell you all about it.\n\n1038\n00:56:09.140 --> 00:56:10.530\nSo here's, the QMail site.\n\n1039\n00:56:10.530 --> 00:56:13.660\nGranted, they're not really\nsupporting it anymore, but\n\n1040\n00:56:13.660 --> 00:56:15.540\nthey still have the site in place.\n\n1041\n00:56:15.540 --> 00:56:16.990\nAnd you can come in and read about it and\n\n1042\n00:56:16.990 --> 00:56:20.320\nsee information, most of them\ndon't have forums or anything.\n\n1043\n00:56:20.320 --> 00:56:23.940\nThey use mailing lists, because that's\nhow everything was back in the day.\n\n1044\n00:56:23.940 --> 00:56:30.680\nYou'll see PostFix is a little bit better,\nif we take a look at it.\n\n1045\n00:56:30.680 --> 00:56:35.330\nSo here's the Postfix page, and you can go\nin, you can hold the source and all that.\n\n1046\n00:56:35.330 --> 00:56:37.010\nLearn more about it and so on.\n\n1047\n00:56:37.010 --> 00:56:38.850\nNotice that it says here, Postfix,\n\n1048\n00:56:38.850 --> 00:56:43.000\nmail server that started life at IBM\nResearch as an alternative to Sendmail.\n\n1049\n00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:45.820\nThat's how it was developed and\nit has succeeded.\n\n1050\n00:56:47.640 --> 00:56:50.990\nGood old sendmail,\nsendmail is one of the only ones,\n\n1051\n00:56:50.990 --> 00:56:53.150\nnotice how all of these are .org and\n\n1052\n00:56:53.150 --> 00:56:57.880\nnonprofits, sendmail is actually\ndeveloped by a for profit company.\n\n1053\n00:56:57.880 --> 00:56:59.880\nSo you'll see sendmail.com, so\n\n1054\n00:56:59.880 --> 00:57:03.830\nthey have the open source version,\nwhich is what most servers run.\n\n1055\n00:57:03.830 --> 00:57:07.170\nAnd then you can pay to buy their\nCentreon Enterprise Platform.\n\n1056\n00:57:07.170 --> 00:57:09.350\nWhich is their-\n>> -That sound fancy.\n\n1057\n00:57:09.350 --> 00:57:09.970\n>> Commercial.\n\n1058\n00:57:09.970 --> 00:57:11.014\nIt is fancy.\n\n1059\n00:57:11.014 --> 00:57:12.419\nCentreon, just that name right.\n\n1060\n00:57:12.419 --> 00:57:15.800\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But anyhow, there's the page for\n\n1061\n00:57:15.800 --> 00:57:18.010\nthem and\nyou can get information from them.\n\n1062\n00:57:18.010 --> 00:57:19.790\nAnd then the last one was Exim.\n\n1063\n00:57:19.790 --> 00:57:25.140\nAnd if we take a look at them,\n\n1064\n00:57:25.140 --> 00:57:28.360\nyou can go to their site and\nread more about their product.\n\n1065\n00:57:28.360 --> 00:57:31.546\nAnd so they've got their documentation,\nthey've got a Wiki,\n\n1066\n00:57:31.546 --> 00:57:35.499\nvarious things that are on there,\napparently they've got a google plus page,\n\n1067\n00:57:35.499 --> 00:57:38.461\nnow what kind of stuff would\nthey post on a google plus page?\n\n1068\n00:57:38.461 --> 00:57:41.300\n>> People's emails that come through\n>> So anyhow,\n\n1069\n00:57:41.300 --> 00:57:45.930\nwe can see their stuff, apparently they\nuploaded a security fix on May 28th.\n\n1070\n00:57:45.930 --> 00:57:47.250\n>> Good to know.\n\n1071\n00:57:47.250 --> 00:57:47.790\nSo there we go.\n\n1072\n00:57:47.790 --> 00:57:50.820\nSo these are just some of\nthe different ones that are out there.\n\n1073\n00:57:50.820 --> 00:57:54.320\nKeep in mind that most of these are being\ndeveloped my just the community.\n\n1074\n00:57:54.320 --> 00:57:56.307\nSo, don't expect a fancy webpage but\n\n1075\n00:57:56.307 --> 00:57:59.169\ndo expect a product that's\ngoing to work really well.\n\n1076\n00:57:59.169 --> 00:58:00.336\nPostfix works great.\n\n1077\n00:58:00.336 --> 00:58:01.295\n>> I like it.\n\n1078\n00:58:01.295 --> 00:58:04.044\n>> So,\nthose are the ones that are out there.\n\n1079\n00:58:04.044 --> 00:58:04.757\nAll right.\n\n1080\n00:58:04.757 --> 00:58:07.840\nNow, I know I said you don't need\nto be able to configure these.\n\n1081\n00:58:07.840 --> 00:58:09.720\nBut I do wanna show you how they work and\n\n1082\n00:58:09.720 --> 00:58:12.930\nkind of give you a little bit of\na view of some of the stuff we can do.\n\n1083\n00:58:12.930 --> 00:58:16.440\nLooking at the time, though,\nit is a little short on this segment.\n\n1084\n00:58:16.440 --> 00:58:17.190\nSo why don't we do this?\n\n1085\n00:58:17.190 --> 00:58:18.830\nWhy don't we stop here and take a break?\n\n1086\n00:58:18.830 --> 00:58:21.620\nAnd when we get back, I'm gonna show\nyou how the mail system works and\n\n1087\n00:58:21.620 --> 00:58:24.920\nhow we kind of interact with it, and\njust a few little tweaks that we can poke\n\n1088\n00:58:24.920 --> 00:58:28.070\naround with just to go a little\nbit beyond, a little beyond.\n\n1089\n00:58:29.100 --> 00:58:29.840\n>> Nice.\n\n1090\n00:58:29.840 --> 00:58:37.253\n>> Well alright ladies and gentlemen\nstay tuned, we'll be back in a few.\n\n1091\n00:58:37.253 --> 00:58:40.085\n[MUSIC]\n\n1092\n00:58:40.085 --> 00:58:41.550\nAll right welcome back.\n\n1093\n00:58:41.550 --> 00:58:45.410\nSo I said we didn't have to worry about\nconfiguration, but I do just want to show\n\n1094\n00:58:45.410 --> 00:58:49.990\nyou a little bit of how we can configure\npostfix and get it going, when I installed\n\n1095\n00:58:49.990 --> 00:58:53.770\nCentOS on this machine this morning,\nI didn't tell it anything about postfix.\n\n1096\n00:58:53.770 --> 00:58:56.390\nI told it to do a basic server install and\nthat's it.\n\n1097\n00:58:56.390 --> 00:59:00.470\nAnd as part of that basic install it did,\nthe Postfix install for me.\n\n1098\n00:59:00.470 --> 00:59:03.540\nAnd that basic configuration\nis good enough for most of us.\n\n1099\n00:59:03.540 --> 00:59:06.530\nIt will allow your server to send\nnotification emails to you if that's what\n\n1100\n00:59:06.530 --> 00:59:07.520\nyou need, right?\n\n1101\n00:59:07.520 --> 00:59:09.020\nBut if you wanna have\na full blown mail server,\n\n1102\n00:59:09.020 --> 00:59:10.870\nyou may need to tweak it a little bit.\n\n1103\n00:59:10.870 --> 00:59:13.500\nThe configuration for Postfix,\n\n1104\n00:59:13.500 --> 00:59:19.210\nif we browse into /etc/postfix,\nyou'll see it right in there.\n\n1105\n00:59:19.210 --> 00:59:21.920\nSo there's a bunch of\nfiles that are in there,\n\n1106\n00:59:21.920 --> 00:59:25.882\nreally the configuration is stored\nin two files, master.cf and\n\n1107\n00:59:25.882 --> 00:59:29.560\nmain.cf, pretty rare that you mess\nwith anything in master.cf, though.\n\n1108\n00:59:29.560 --> 00:59:31.080\nYou normally leave that alone.\n\n1109\n00:59:31.080 --> 00:59:33.640\nSo, almost all of our real\nwork is in main.cf, and\n\n1110\n00:59:35.010 --> 00:59:39.702\nif I take a look at that one,\nyou'll see it's well-documented.\n\n1111\n00:59:39.702 --> 00:59:43.810\nAnd notice, I got a little\naggressive with my scrolling there.\n\n1112\n00:59:45.630 --> 00:59:50.640\nWhere is it, somewhere in here it\ncalls master.cf where did it go?\n\n1113\n00:59:53.020 --> 00:59:55.160\nShoot, I thought I just\nsaw it a second ago.\n\n1114\n00:59:55.160 --> 01:00:01.040\nIt is in here somewhere,\nwell somewhere in here,\n\n1115\n01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:04.690\nit actually does call Master.CF\nto load information from it.\n\n1116\n01:00:04.690 --> 01:00:08.790\nBut what you'll see in here, is basically\nhow to bounce messages, you'll see\n\n1117\n01:00:08.790 --> 01:00:13.580\nthe queue directory for where emails are\nstored while they're waiting to be sent.\n\n1118\n01:00:13.580 --> 01:00:17.800\nYou'll see some of the other information,\nlike where the postfix commands\n\n1119\n01:00:17.800 --> 01:00:23.650\nare located in this case /usr/sbin where\nthe daemon itself, where the software\n\n1120\n01:00:23.650 --> 01:00:27.770\nresides, you'll see the data directory for\nit, just a couple of different things\n\n1121\n01:00:27.770 --> 01:00:32.520\nthat are in here,the center around\nthe configuration of the server.\n\n1122\n01:00:32.520 --> 01:00:34.930\nWe might not have to\nmess with any of this,\n\n1123\n01:00:34.930 --> 01:00:37.640\nusually what we have to mess\nwith is this right here.\n\n1124\n01:00:37.640 --> 01:00:39.800\nYour Internet host, and domain names.\n\n1125\n01:00:39.800 --> 01:00:43.720\nYou need to tell it the domain names for\nwhich you accept email.\n\n1126\n01:00:43.720 --> 01:00:46.780\nSo I might have Don@ITPRO.TV, so\n\n1127\n01:00:46.780 --> 01:00:52.150\nI would add ITPRO.TV as my\naccepted domain name here.\n\n1128\n01:00:52.150 --> 01:00:54.990\nSo, it would know that,\nthat's incoming email I should accept.\n\n1129\n01:00:54.990 --> 01:00:59.680\nIf I get incoming email for Bob@aol.com,\nI'm not AOL, I should throw that out.\n\n1130\n01:00:59.680 --> 01:01:04.860\nI can get email from Bob@aol, but not\nto Bob because that's not on my server.\n\n1131\n01:01:04.860 --> 01:01:08.840\nSo that's normally one of the big ones\nthat we modify right here, that host name.\n\n1132\n01:01:08.840 --> 01:01:14.350\nIf you have more than one, you can specify\nwhat your specific domain name is,\n\n1133\n01:01:14.350 --> 01:01:17.760\nthe one that pertains to you,\nand then you can go through and\n\n1134\n01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:22.520\nspecify how you send email, and\nreceive email, so there's variations.\n\n1135\n01:01:22.520 --> 01:01:26.080\nBy default it does bond to all of\nthe IP addresses on your system.\n\n1136\n01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:29.504\nYou might want it to tie to a specific IP,\nso\n\n1137\n01:01:29.504 --> 01:01:34.752\nyou can filter that right here as\nwell as IPv4 and IPv6 support.\n\n1138\n01:01:34.752 --> 01:01:36.280\nThat's really about it.\n\n1139\n01:01:36.280 --> 01:01:38.150\nWhat else?\n\n1140\n01:01:38.150 --> 01:01:40.240\nThis is going on about mail filter rules.\n\n1141\n01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:42.840\nYou can create all sorts\nof filters to adjust\n\n1142\n01:01:42.840 --> 01:01:47.050\nwhat email you'll allow to come in and\nout, trust relays.\n\n1143\n01:01:47.050 --> 01:01:49.300\nYeah, this is all advanced stuff\nwe don't need to worry about.\n\n1144\n01:01:49.300 --> 01:01:51.540\nBut those basic things that I\nshowed you up there at the top,\n\n1145\n01:01:51.540 --> 01:01:54.805\nthose are pretty much\nthe ones we wanna be aware.\n\n1146\n01:01:54.805 --> 01:02:01.305\nAnd what I did is, in the notes for the\nshow, I put the main things right here.\n\n1147\n01:02:01.305 --> 01:02:06.115\nSo, these are the main things we might\nwant to look through and adjust in there.\n\n1148\n01:02:06.115 --> 01:02:10.850\nSo, if I specify inet_interfaces all,\nright,\n\n1149\n01:02:10.850 --> 01:02:12.570\nthat's gonna tie to all the interfaces.\n\n1150\n01:02:12.570 --> 01:02:17.120\nOr what domains I wanna relay for,\nfor my users,\n\n1151\n01:02:17.120 --> 01:02:19.610\nwhen they have a mailbox,\nwhat do I wanna store that as?\n\n1152\n01:02:19.610 --> 01:02:22.120\nThere's actually two different format for\nmailboxes.\n\n1153\n01:02:22.120 --> 01:02:24.150\nSo, these are all different\nthings that we might wanna do, so\n\n1154\n01:02:24.150 --> 01:02:26.800\nI just put the major entries right there.\n\n1155\n01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:28.440\nSo, you guys would have\nthem in your notes.\n\n1156\n01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:32.820\nAgain, not likely to make it on\nthe exam but just useful to have.\n\n1157\n01:02:32.820 --> 01:02:38.520\nOkay, there is one other file\nin there /etc/postfix/virtual.\n\n1158\n01:02:38.520 --> 01:02:43.210\nIf you're running on a shared server,\nyou might have multiple virtual servers or\n\n1159\n01:02:43.210 --> 01:02:45.720\nvirtual instances of\npostfix that are running.\n\n1160\n01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:50.660\nAnd so you've got this virtual\nfile that's keeping track of that.\n\n1161\n01:02:50.660 --> 01:02:55.270\nAnd so here's where you'll define\nthese different instances of post fix.\n\n1162\n01:02:55.270 --> 01:02:58.670\nSo, you got this post map command\nthat kind of ties them together and\n\n1163\n01:02:58.670 --> 01:03:01.090\nit explains how that works in here.\n\n1164\n01:03:01.090 --> 01:03:04.620\nAnd if you can make it to the end of it,\nyeah, there's no examples on this one.\n\n1165\n01:03:04.620 --> 01:03:07.730\nBut basically it'll have where\nyou can put those entries in and\n\n1166\n01:03:07.730 --> 01:03:11.020\nmap those domains to the different\nvirtual instances of postfix.\n\n1167\n01:03:11.020 --> 01:03:14.790\nMost of us don't use that, but if you're\nan Internet Service Provider or somebody,\n\n1168\n01:03:14.790 --> 01:03:17.890\nthen you may.\n\n1169\n01:03:17.890 --> 01:03:20.940\nOtherwise, the email system is up and\nrunning.\n\n1170\n01:03:20.940 --> 01:03:23.920\nWe don't necessarily see it,\nbut it is there.\n\n1171\n01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:30.460\nI'm logged in right now as root and\nI could say mail dpezet.\n\n1172\n01:03:30.460 --> 01:03:32.960\nI want to send an email to dpezet.\n\n1173\n01:03:32.960 --> 01:03:34.480\nActually, you know what?\n\n1174\n01:03:34.480 --> 01:03:38.390\nI forgot my hostname.\n\n1175\n01:03:38.390 --> 01:03:41.130\nLet me see, interrupt out of that.\n\n1176\n01:03:41.130 --> 01:03:43.670\nMy system is called Localhost.\n\n1177\n01:03:43.670 --> 01:03:47.420\nSo if I wanna email my other account,\nI need mail dpezet@localhost,\n\n1178\n01:03:47.420 --> 01:03:49.784\nI didn't attach any domain names, right?\n\n1179\n01:03:49.784 --> 01:03:50.992\nSo I have to do it this way.\n\n1180\n01:03:50.992 --> 01:03:55.764\nSo I'm gonna send an email to another\nuser on my system, dpezet@localhost.\n\n1181\n01:03:55.764 --> 01:04:00.660\nAll right, it wants a subject so\nthis will be my Welcome Message.\n\n1182\n01:04:00.660 --> 01:04:03.170\nAnd now, the actual message.\n\n1183\n01:04:03.170 --> 01:04:05.030\nI'll say, welcome to my server.\n\n1184\n01:04:07.370 --> 01:04:12.620\nYou better not mess anything up,\nall right?\n\n1185\n01:04:12.620 --> 01:04:15.170\nAnd when you're done you just put\na period on the line by itself,\n\n1186\n01:04:15.170 --> 01:04:16.980\nthat lets it know that it's\nthe end of the message and\n\n1187\n01:04:16.980 --> 01:04:21.710\nthen it will say end of transmission,\nnow the message is sent, okay?\n\n1188\n01:04:21.710 --> 01:04:25.660\nI just generated a message using\nthe command line mail client.\n\n1189\n01:04:25.660 --> 01:04:31.550\nWhen it did that, it took it, it stuck it\nin my queue and submitted it to postfix.\n\n1190\n01:04:31.550 --> 01:04:35.820\nPostfix got it and said do I know\nwho dpezet at local host is?\n\n1191\n01:04:35.820 --> 01:04:36.900\nAnd it said, well yeah I do.\n\n1192\n01:04:36.900 --> 01:04:38.810\nDpezet is right here on this system.\n\n1193\n01:04:38.810 --> 01:04:42.930\nAnd then it delivered that email to\nthat user by moving it into their queue.\n\n1194\n01:04:42.930 --> 01:04:45.060\nSo really postfix is just\nmoving queues around,\n\n1195\n01:04:45.060 --> 01:04:47.780\nmoving messages from one queue to another.\n\n1196\n01:04:47.780 --> 01:04:50.730\nSo if I jump over to dpezet,\nhere I am, dpezet.\n\n1197\n01:04:50.730 --> 01:04:53.240\nAnd the next time I press enter,\n\n1198\n01:04:53.240 --> 01:04:59.130\nyou have a new email in\n/var/spool/mail/dpezet, right.\n\n1199\n01:04:59.130 --> 01:05:02.020\nPostfix got an email in it's queue file,\nor\n\n1200\n01:05:02.020 --> 01:05:06.150\nfolder, and then it just moved it to\nthe appropriate queue folder for me.\n\n1201\n01:05:06.150 --> 01:05:09.330\nSo it's not like a true mailbox,\nit's really just a folder.\n\n1202\n01:05:09.330 --> 01:05:13.980\nAnd so, since I'm dpezet, I can just type\nmail and that'll take me into my email.\n\n1203\n01:05:13.980 --> 01:05:16.617\nAnd I can see there's a welcome\nmessage and if I wanna read it,\n\n1204\n01:05:16.617 --> 01:05:19.811\nI'm just gonna type 1 to get an email and\nhere it is, welcome to my server,\n\n1205\n01:05:19.811 --> 01:05:21.573\nyou better not mess anything up, okay?\n\n1206\n01:05:21.573 --> 01:05:24.780\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And I can just do q to get out and\n\n1207\n01:05:24.780 --> 01:05:29.990\nnow I'm out of my mailbox, now notice it\ndidn't delete the email, held one message.\n\n1208\n01:05:29.990 --> 01:05:31.690\nIt's just marked as read now.\n\n1209\n01:05:31.690 --> 01:05:35.840\nIt was unread a moment ago and\nif I go back into mail, now it's read.\n\n1210\n01:05:35.840 --> 01:05:40.210\nSo there was a letter n over here,\nsaying not read.\n\n1211\n01:05:40.210 --> 01:05:45.880\nAnd now that n is gone, so I know, whoops\nI know that I've read that message, okay.\n\n1212\n01:05:45.880 --> 01:05:50.488\nSo that mail system,\nit's there, it's not pretty.\n\n1213\n01:05:50.488 --> 01:05:52.480\nThere's no POP3, there's no IMAP4,\n\n1214\n01:05:52.480 --> 01:05:56.570\nit's just straight up SMTP and\nthe cues are simply foldered.\n\n1215\n01:05:56.570 --> 01:06:00.790\nIt's just moving emails from folder to\nfolder and recognizing that right here.\n\n1216\n01:06:00.790 --> 01:06:02.930\nObviously, if you want to\nrun a full email server,\n\n1217\n01:06:02.930 --> 01:06:07.190\nyou're gonna want a lot more than that but\nthat is kind of the basics.\n\n1218\n01:06:07.190 --> 01:06:10.090\nThere are some other neat things\nthat are built in as a part of this,\n\n1219\n01:06:10.090 --> 01:06:14.310\nlike we might have aliases, we might\nwanna have more than one name that\n\n1220\n01:06:14.310 --> 01:06:18.710\npoints to dpezet, and so\nwe can define aliases in postfix.\n\n1221\n01:06:18.710 --> 01:06:23.526\nThat is done in /etc/aliases,\nwhich is actually a file.\n\n1222\n01:06:23.526 --> 01:06:28.062\nShoot, I'm dpezet,\nlet me switch back to my root user here.\n\n1223\n01:06:30.857 --> 01:06:37.020\nI'm gonna edit the /etc/aliases file and\nin here you can define aliases.\n\n1224\n01:06:37.020 --> 01:06:38.840\nNotice all the aliases\nthat are already in here.\n\n1225\n01:06:38.840 --> 01:06:41.930\nIf somebody sends an email to bin,\ndaemon, adm, lp,\n\n1226\n01:06:41.930 --> 01:06:44.900\nall these services,\nit goes to root, right?\n\n1227\n01:06:44.900 --> 01:06:46.010\nAnd that's normally what you want.\n\n1228\n01:06:46.010 --> 01:06:48.610\nYou don't want email boxes for\nall these different services so\n\n1229\n01:06:48.610 --> 01:06:50.820\nthey end up going to root.\n\n1230\n01:06:50.820 --> 01:06:55.600\nBut we can add other ones if we\nwant based on our needs, right?\n\n1231\n01:06:55.600 --> 01:06:59.840\nSo if I have an employee and they're going\nto get an email and I want their email to\n\n1232\n01:06:59.840 --> 01:07:03.430\ngo to other people I can come in and\nI can put that entry in here.\n\n1233\n01:07:03.430 --> 01:07:08.170\nSo I can say for example, if I'm the\nadmin, but I don't always log in as root,\n\n1234\n01:07:08.170 --> 01:07:10.950\nI log in as dpezet because\nthat's good security practice.\n\n1235\n01:07:10.950 --> 01:07:15.130\nI might put in here root goes to dpezet.\n\n1236\n01:07:16.180 --> 01:07:20.220\nAnd now any time somebody sends an email\nto root, the email will be sent to me.\n\n1237\n01:07:20.220 --> 01:07:23.180\nAnd I'll get that copy and I can read\nit without having to log in as root.\n\n1238\n01:07:23.180 --> 01:07:26.230\nYou don't wanna have to log in as\nroot just to run the mail client.\n\n1239\n01:07:26.230 --> 01:07:27.490\nSo this'll forward it along to me.\n\n1240\n01:07:27.490 --> 01:07:31.637\nAnd I'll get a copy of it, all right.\n\n1241\n01:07:31.637 --> 01:07:34.470\nNow whenever you adjust an alias like that\n\n1242\n01:07:34.470 --> 01:07:36.720\nyou have to tell the system\nthat there's a new alias.\n\n1243\n01:07:36.720 --> 01:07:40.180\nAnd so you do that by running\nthe newaliases command.\n\n1244\n01:07:40.180 --> 01:07:42.790\nAnd so, when I run that it doesn't\ngive you a lot of feedback.\n\n1245\n01:07:42.790 --> 01:07:44.968\nIt just says reprocess that aliases file.\n\n1246\n01:07:44.968 --> 01:07:46.463\nSo, that's what's doing right there.\n\n1247\n01:07:46.463 --> 01:07:51.071\n>> Mm-hm, now, let's say now what if\nyou get an email in and you know,\n\n1248\n01:07:51.071 --> 01:07:53.556\nyou wanna send it to somewhere else.\n\n1249\n01:07:53.556 --> 01:07:54.625\n>> All right, okay.\n\n1250\n01:07:54.625 --> 01:07:57.514\n>> You email in and\nyou wanted forward that guy on.\n\n1251\n01:07:57.514 --> 01:08:01.350\n>> Yeah so, users can actually control\ntheir own forwards if they want.\n\n1252\n01:08:01.350 --> 01:08:04.408\nSo if I decide, hey, I log into\nthis system every now and then but\n\n1253\n01:08:04.408 --> 01:08:06.630\nmost of the time I'm\njust in my Gmail account.\n\n1254\n01:08:06.630 --> 01:08:09.700\nSo I wanna send this along somewhere else,\nright?\n\n1255\n01:08:09.700 --> 01:08:11.890\nSo I can go in and I can set up a forward.\n\n1256\n01:08:11.890 --> 01:08:14.330\nIt's done on a per user basis.\n\n1257\n01:08:14.330 --> 01:08:17.460\nWe can do it as an admin, no,\nthat's not what I wanted, there we go.\n\n1258\n01:08:17.460 --> 01:08:19.060\nWe can do it as an admin but\nit's better for\n\n1259\n01:08:19.060 --> 01:08:21.960\nthe users to do it themselves\nif they wanna set up a forward.\n\n1260\n01:08:21.960 --> 01:08:27.210\nAll they have to do is in their home\ndirectory, so I'm in /home/dpezet,\n\n1261\n01:08:27.210 --> 01:08:33.080\nthey can create a file or edit it if\nit already exists, called .forward.\n\n1262\n01:08:33.080 --> 01:08:34.990\nThe dot at the beginning makes it hidden.\n\n1263\n01:08:34.990 --> 01:08:40.460\n.forward and all they have to do is list,\none per line,\n\n1264\n01:08:40.460 --> 01:08:44.480\nthe other people or locations they\nwanna get a copy of the email.\n\n1265\n01:08:44.480 --> 01:08:48.380\nSo if I want Bob Smith to get\na copy of all of my emails,\n\n1266\n01:08:48.380 --> 01:08:51.860\nI would just put Bob Smith right\nthere on the first line bsmith.\n\n1267\n01:08:51.860 --> 01:08:55.074\nSo now when an email comes to me,\na copy gets sent to him.\n\n1268\n01:08:55.074 --> 01:08:57.847\nAnd then I can add don@itpro.tv and\n\n1269\n01:08:57.847 --> 01:09:03.700\nnow when I get a copy of my email it will\nalso be relayed out to don@itpro.tv.\n\n1270\n01:09:03.700 --> 01:09:06.370\nSo now I can go and\ncheck it on my normal mailbox, all right.\n\n1271\n01:09:06.370 --> 01:09:09.900\nSo we just add one after another\neach person we wanna forward to.\n\n1272\n01:09:09.900 --> 01:09:13.810\nAnd when we say that,\nthat is just right here in my profile.\n\n1273\n01:09:13.810 --> 01:09:16.200\nI have now got a .forward file.\n\n1274\n01:09:16.200 --> 01:09:19.790\nAnd my account will forward that.\n\n1275\n01:09:19.790 --> 01:09:21.040\n>> Pretty slick.\n\n1276\n01:09:21.040 --> 01:09:21.690\n>> It's straightforward,\n\n1277\n01:09:21.690 --> 01:09:23.850\nit's always nice when the end-users\ncan kinda manage it themselves.\n\n1278\n01:09:26.050 --> 01:09:30.450\nNow if emails are getting stuck on your\nsystem, if emails are being generated and\n\n1279\n01:09:30.450 --> 01:09:33.430\nnot delivered,\nyou might need to check out those queues.\n\n1280\n01:09:33.430 --> 01:09:37.130\nAnd if you know where the queues are, you\ncan browse around and take a look at them.\n\n1281\n01:09:37.130 --> 01:09:40.335\nSo If I go back to my root user,\n\n1282\n01:09:40.335 --> 01:09:45.250\n/var/spool/mail, we can jump in there and\n\n1283\n01:09:45.250 --> 01:09:49.610\nyou'll see each user with their own\nfolder, so I can go into dpezet.\n\n1284\n01:09:49.610 --> 01:09:53.544\nAnd or actually, I just had to do more\ndpezet and we can come in here and\n\n1285\n01:09:53.544 --> 01:09:56.310\nI can see the emails are kind\nof lumped together right?\n\n1286\n01:09:56.310 --> 01:10:01.630\nSo that's the mail queue for dpezet and\nthat's my mailbox, effectively my mailbox.\n\n1287\n01:10:01.630 --> 01:10:05.750\nSo we can look at it, we can see it\nthere and kind of manipulate the data.\n\n1288\n01:10:05.750 --> 01:10:09.382\nWe also have the mailq command,\nwhich if you run mailq it,\n\n1289\n01:10:09.382 --> 01:10:13.180\nby default looks at your own\nqueue to show what's up.\n\n1290\n01:10:13.180 --> 01:10:16.900\nAnd you can point at other users\ntoo if you got permission.\n\n1291\n01:10:16.900 --> 01:10:20.220\nAnd so you'll see like mailq and\nthen a recipient.\n\n1292\n01:10:20.220 --> 01:10:24.130\nSee, how this is built off the sendmail\nsystem, but I'm running postfix and\n\n1293\n01:10:24.130 --> 01:10:25.210\nit still works.\n\n1294\n01:10:25.210 --> 01:10:27.940\nSo, it says the postfix sendmail command.\n\n1295\n01:10:27.940 --> 01:10:31.770\nIt's that emulation layer that\nI was talking about earlier.\n\n1296\n01:10:31.770 --> 01:10:36.684\nSo if I run mailq dpezet,\nlet's see, requires,\n\n1297\n01:10:36.684 --> 01:10:40.548\ndisplay queue requires no recipient.\n\n1298\n01:10:40.548 --> 01:10:43.825\nYeah, that's right, it's just displaying\nthe queues on the system itself.\n\n1299\n01:10:43.825 --> 01:10:48.041\nAnd I made a comment to you earlier, Nate\nthere's really no way I can show you guys\n\n1300\n01:10:48.041 --> 01:10:50.955\na queue because email's gonna\nmove through my system so\n\n1301\n01:10:50.955 --> 01:10:54.120\nfast that the queue is gonna be\nempty any time that I check it.\n\n1302\n01:10:54.120 --> 01:10:55.170\nIf I were to send an email and\n\n1303\n01:10:55.170 --> 01:10:59.860\nit were to get stuck, though, then I\nwould see it sitting there in the queue.\n\n1304\n01:10:59.860 --> 01:11:02.030\nSo, yeah, I don't have a good\nway to demonstrate that one.\n\n1305\n01:11:04.160 --> 01:11:07.400\nAll right, so\nthat in a nutshell is postfix.\n\n1306\n01:11:07.400 --> 01:11:10.210\nPretty straight forward, you know\nthe default config is good enough for\n\n1307\n01:11:10.210 --> 01:11:11.150\nmost people.\n\n1308\n01:11:11.150 --> 01:11:14.440\nIf we wanna go more advanced,\nwell, that's for another exam.\n\n1309\n01:11:14.440 --> 01:11:18.220\nOn this one, they just want you to\nbe familiar with the four big guys.\n\n1310\n01:11:18.220 --> 01:11:21.400\nQmail, Postfix, Exim and Sendmail, right?\n\n1311\n01:11:21.400 --> 01:11:23.260\nThose four, there's others out there too,\n\n1312\n01:11:23.260 --> 01:11:25.110\nthere's this plenty of\nthem that are out there.\n\n1313\n01:11:25.110 --> 01:11:28.075\nYou just kind of choose which\none's right for your environment.\n\n1314\n01:11:28.075 --> 01:11:29.816\n>> Right.\n\n1315\n01:11:29.816 --> 01:11:30.682\n>> All right,\n\n1316\n01:11:30.682 --> 01:11:36.230\nthe very last thing that we're gonna\ncover in this episode is printing.\n\n1317\n01:11:36.230 --> 01:11:41.310\nRight, printing in the Linux world and\nwhile we have some time left in this\n\n1318\n01:11:41.310 --> 01:11:43.670\nsegment, I don't know\nthat we have enough time.\n\n1319\n01:11:43.670 --> 01:11:45.590\nWhy don't we break schedule a little bit?\n\n1320\n01:11:45.590 --> 01:11:48.090\nLet's stop and\ntake a break a little bit early.\n\n1321\n01:11:48.090 --> 01:11:50.343\nAnd when we get back we'll cover printing.\n\n1322\n01:11:50.343 --> 01:11:52.597\nAnd then that'll wrap up the show,\nthat's the last thing we got.\n\n1323\n01:11:52.597 --> 01:11:53.874\nIs that all right?\n>> Great, yep, sounds great.\n\n1324\n01:11:53.874 --> 01:11:56.332\n>> All right, so stay tuned,\nwe'll be back with printing.\n\n1325\n01:11:56.332 --> 01:11:57.075\nAfter this.\n\n1326\n01:11:57.075 --> 01:12:02.203\n[MUSIC]\n\n1327\n01:12:05.239 --> 01:12:09.319\nAll right, for our last segment, we're\ngonna be taking a look at printing under\n\n1328\n01:12:09.319 --> 01:12:13.825\nLinux and I know what you're saying, wait\na minute, Don, who prints anymore, right?\n\n1329\n01:12:13.825 --> 01:12:15.475\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We say that as we have all our papers\n\n1330\n01:12:15.475 --> 01:12:16.238\nover here on the podium.\n\n1331\n01:12:16.238 --> 01:12:16.989\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But\n\n1332\n01:12:16.989 --> 01:12:19.836\n[LAUGH] printing is not\nwhat it used to be.\n\n1333\n01:12:19.836 --> 01:12:23.658\nBut every company still generates\nprinted invoices and paperwork and\n\n1334\n01:12:23.658 --> 01:12:25.300\nthings of that nature.\n\n1335\n01:12:25.300 --> 01:12:28.035\nSo printing is still a very,\nvery common thing.\n\n1336\n01:12:28.035 --> 01:12:29.110\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1337\n01:12:29.110 --> 01:12:33.500\n>> Unfortunately for years in the Unix\nenvironment printing was a real challenge.\n\n1338\n01:12:33.500 --> 01:12:36.470\nThere just wasn't really\na great way to handle printing.\n\n1339\n01:12:36.470 --> 01:12:40.480\nThere wasn't a common driver system,\nit was really something that was more or\n\n1340\n01:12:40.480 --> 01:12:41.820\nless challenging.\n\n1341\n01:12:41.820 --> 01:12:48.150\nWell, we got some help from a unexpected\ncompany several years ago, Apple.\n\n1342\n01:12:48.150 --> 01:12:51.040\nWhen Apple decided to adopt\nthe BSD environment for\n\n1343\n01:12:51.040 --> 01:12:54.470\nrunning underneath the OS X.\n\n1344\n01:12:54.470 --> 01:12:57.000\nThey decided there had to be\nsome better way to handle\n\n1345\n01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:01.725\nprinting in Unix environments and so\nthey developed a system called CUPS.\n\n1346\n01:13:01.725 --> 01:13:06.150\nC-U-P-S, The Common Unix Printing System.\n\n1347\n01:13:06.150 --> 01:13:08.930\nAnd they developed it,\nand they open-sourced it.\n\n1348\n01:13:08.930 --> 01:13:10.210\nThey released it to the world.\n\n1349\n01:13:10.210 --> 01:13:14.120\nAnd it's a really good system that\ncreates a standard driver-based\n\n1350\n01:13:14.120 --> 01:13:16.940\nenvironment to be able to\nprint to network printers and\n\n1351\n01:13:16.940 --> 01:13:19.910\nlocal printers in the Unix environment,\nright?\n\n1352\n01:13:19.910 --> 01:13:22.090\n>> Sorry to interrupt you.\n\n1353\n01:13:22.090 --> 01:13:26.010\nSo Apple developed this CUPS and\nthen open-sourced it and\n\n1354\n01:13:26.010 --> 01:13:28.330\nis giving it away for everybody?\n\n1355\n01:13:28.330 --> 01:13:29.860\n>> That's right.\n>> The same company?\n\n1356\n01:13:29.860 --> 01:13:31.000\n>> Same company, yeah.\n\n1357\n01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:36.547\nAnd the problem is you can't produce\nit in different colors, and sell it.\n\n1358\n01:13:36.547 --> 01:13:39.110\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> People aren't like I want a printing\n\n1359\n01:13:39.110 --> 01:13:42.368\nsystem that's white and\nit has the stickers for my car, so.\n\n1360\n01:13:42.368 --> 01:13:45.956\n[LAUGH] So yeah, so they gave it back,\nand that is one of the nice\n\n1361\n01:13:45.956 --> 01:13:50.235\nthings about the open source Unix\ncommunities that are out there is that,\n\n1362\n01:13:50.235 --> 01:13:54.748\nas people develop neat things often times\nthey give it back to the community.\n\n1363\n01:13:54.748 --> 01:13:56.470\nAnd the other distros can benefit from it.\n\n1364\n01:13:56.470 --> 01:14:00.700\nSo you might not own a single Apple\nproduct, you might be all Linux but\n\n1365\n01:14:00.700 --> 01:14:03.410\nyou're actually benefiting from\nsome of the things that Apple has\n\n1366\n01:14:03.410 --> 01:14:07.190\ndeveloped inside of that ecosystem and\nprinting is one.\n\n1367\n01:14:07.190 --> 01:14:11.060\nI set up Linux printers prior to CUPS and\nit was not a pleasant,\n\n1368\n01:14:11.060 --> 01:14:13.900\nit's not something fun,\nit was different for every single printer.\n\n1369\n01:14:13.900 --> 01:14:16.240\nNow it's actually really easy, so\n\n1370\n01:14:16.240 --> 01:14:19.920\nwe just have to go through a few steps\nto get printing set up on our system.\n\n1371\n01:14:19.920 --> 01:14:22.980\nNow this is one of those things\nwhere if you have a GUI again,\n\n1372\n01:14:22.980 --> 01:14:25.750\nthere's usually a little wizard\nyou run through, it's no big deal.\n\n1373\n01:14:25.750 --> 01:14:27.420\nFrom a command line it's\na little bit different so\n\n1374\n01:14:27.420 --> 01:14:30.110\nwe're gonna take a look at that,\nall right?\n\n1375\n01:14:30.110 --> 01:14:35.490\nFirst off, CUPS is not necessarily\na default service on every UNIX system.\n\n1376\n01:14:35.490 --> 01:14:38.630\nOn Red Hat and Sento as it is,\nbut on others it might not be.\n\n1377\n01:14:38.630 --> 01:14:40.630\nSo you may need to install it.\n\n1378\n01:14:40.630 --> 01:14:43.210\nif you need to install it,\nthe package name is usually just CUPS.\n\n1379\n01:14:43.210 --> 01:14:44.980\nSo I'm gonna check mine here.\n\n1380\n01:14:44.980 --> 01:14:47.090\nSo I'll just do a yum list cups.\n\n1381\n01:14:48.610 --> 01:14:50.430\nAnd I should say, yeah,\nI installed packages.\n\n1382\n01:14:50.430 --> 01:14:51.600\nSo I've already got it.\n\n1383\n01:14:51.600 --> 01:14:53.500\nIt's installed on my system,\nI'm ready to rock.\n\n1384\n01:14:53.500 --> 01:14:57.070\nIf it wasn't,\nI could do a yum install cups, and\n\n1385\n01:14:57.070 --> 01:14:58.420\nthat would install it and I would have it.\n\n1386\n01:14:58.420 --> 01:14:59.922\nBut again, it's already installed on mine.\n\n1387\n01:14:59.922 --> 01:15:04.030\nAll right, just because it's\ninstalled doesn't mean it's running.\n\n1388\n01:15:04.030 --> 01:15:07.480\nSo we may need to get it started,\none thing you can do is you can check your\n\n1389\n01:15:07.480 --> 01:15:12.210\nservices, so\nI can say like service --status-all, and\n\n1390\n01:15:12.210 --> 01:15:14.290\nI will grep that for cup.\n\n1391\n01:15:15.770 --> 01:15:18.700\nAnd I can see cupsd,\nit's actually running on mine already.\n\n1392\n01:15:18.700 --> 01:15:22.520\nSo it's already in there and running\njust as part of my default install.\n\n1393\n01:15:22.520 --> 01:15:24.430\nIf it wasn't,\nI would just need to start it.\n\n1394\n01:15:24.430 --> 01:15:28.120\nIn the Red Hat world we\nsay service cups start.\n\n1395\n01:15:29.360 --> 01:15:31.310\nAnd that'll start it if\nit isn't already running.\n\n1396\n01:15:31.310 --> 01:15:34.470\nMine's already running, and then if you\nwant to make sure that it starts up every\n\n1397\n01:15:34.470 --> 01:15:40.270\ntime you boot up in the Red Hat world\nyou would say chkconfig cups on.\n\n1398\n01:15:40.270 --> 01:15:43.095\nAnd that just means, make sure you start\nit up every time the system reboots,\n\n1399\n01:15:43.095 --> 01:15:44.050\nall right?\n\n1400\n01:15:44.050 --> 01:15:45.110\nBut that was the default here too.\n\n1401\n01:15:45.110 --> 01:15:46.650\nI didn't really have to\ndo any of those commands,\n\n1402\n01:15:46.650 --> 01:15:50.040\nI just wanted to show you guys so\nyou understand, all right.\n\n1403\n01:15:50.040 --> 01:15:54.200\nonce CUPS is running,\nwe're pretty much in business, right.\n\n1404\n01:15:54.200 --> 01:16:01.430\nIt creates a folder, /etc/cups, and\nthat's where its configuration goes.\n\n1405\n01:16:01.430 --> 01:16:04.770\nBut for the most part we don't really\nhave to configure much with cups.\n\n1406\n01:16:04.770 --> 01:16:07.870\nThe main thing that it needs\nis our printer driver, and\n\n1407\n01:16:07.870 --> 01:16:09.590\nthat's really what cups does.\n\n1408\n01:16:09.590 --> 01:16:13.820\nThe main thing that it does for us is\nit gives us this common driver format.\n\n1409\n01:16:13.820 --> 01:16:17.600\nSo if you're a printer company like HP or\nCanon, Epson and\n\n1410\n01:16:17.600 --> 01:16:20.050\nLexmark, one of the,\nLexmark is IBM now, I think.\n\n1411\n01:16:20.050 --> 01:16:23.710\nAnyhow, if you're one of those guys,\nyou need to be able to create a driver,\n\n1412\n01:16:23.710 --> 01:16:28.590\nand to create a driver for Red Hat, and\na driver for Debian, and a driver for OSX,\n\n1413\n01:16:28.590 --> 01:16:31.510\nand a driver for FreeBSD,\nthat was something you weren't gonna do.\n\n1414\n01:16:31.510 --> 01:16:35.770\nYou would pick the most popular OSs,\nrelease drivers for them, and that was it.\n\n1415\n01:16:35.770 --> 01:16:39.110\nBut now that CUPS is commonplace,\nyou can create a CUPS driver and\n\n1416\n01:16:39.110 --> 01:16:42.260\nit will work on a Mac,\nit'll work in FreeBSD,\n\n1417\n01:16:42.260 --> 01:16:46.650\nit'll work in Red Hat, Debian,\nit'll work across all those.\n\n1418\n01:16:46.650 --> 01:16:50.730\nAnd so now, the printer manufacturers,\nthey really just have to make two drivers,\n\n1419\n01:16:50.730 --> 01:16:54.340\none for Windows, and\none for UNIX, all right?\n\n1420\n01:16:54.340 --> 01:16:56.370\nAnd the UNIX one is a PPD file.\n\n1421\n01:16:56.370 --> 01:16:59.430\nIt's really just one file\nthat you have to get.\n\n1422\n01:16:59.430 --> 01:17:03.350\nAnd so we have a printer here a big\nCanon office printer in the building.\n\n1423\n01:17:03.350 --> 01:17:07.840\nAnd so I wanted to add that to my VM, well\nI went to their website and they actually\n\n1424\n01:17:07.840 --> 01:17:12.660\ndid have some Linux packages, but just to\nprove a point I downloaded the Mac one,\n\n1425\n01:17:12.660 --> 01:17:15.690\nright, cuz well I'm on a Mac any way so\nthat's what I would use.\n\n1426\n01:17:15.690 --> 01:17:18.960\nSo I downloaded that one and\nI just extracted the PPD file from it.\n\n1427\n01:17:18.960 --> 01:17:22.010\nSo I've got the ppd file for\nour printer and\n\n1428\n01:17:22.010 --> 01:17:24.622\nall we have to do is go\ninto this PPD folder.\n\n1429\n01:17:24.622 --> 01:17:29.010\nSo that's /etc/cups/ppd and\n\n1430\n01:17:29.010 --> 01:17:32.470\nwe just have to put our printer file here,\nour printer definition file.\n\n1431\n01:17:32.470 --> 01:17:36.020\nAll right, so I've got it sitting\non a server here in our office,\n\n1432\n01:17:36.020 --> 01:17:36.950\nI'll just get it from there.\n\n1433\n01:17:39.920 --> 01:17:43.980\nSo let me just reach out and get that,\nthrough whatever means, you go out and\n\n1434\n01:17:43.980 --> 01:17:45.805\nyou get that driver.\n\n1435\n01:17:45.805 --> 01:17:50.865\nSo, mine is a Canon image runner\nadvance 7065 that actually\n\n1436\n01:17:50.865 --> 01:17:53.375\nuses the same driver as the 7055.\n\n1437\n01:17:53.375 --> 01:17:58.823\nSo, I'm just doing Canon advance,\n\n1438\n01:17:58.823 --> 01:18:03.048\nCNADVC7055X1.PPD.\n\n1439\n01:18:03.048 --> 01:18:03.930\nI don't know what the X1 means.\n\n1440\n01:18:03.930 --> 01:18:05.380\nYou'd have to ask Canon.\n\n1441\n01:18:05.380 --> 01:18:10.050\nBut [LAUGH] basically that's the PPD file\nand I'm just gonna reach out there and\n\n1442\n01:18:10.050 --> 01:18:14.440\nget it and if I look,\nnow I've got it right there all right.\n\n1443\n01:18:14.440 --> 01:18:17.570\nNow cups runs is a system service and so\n\n1444\n01:18:17.570 --> 01:18:22.000\nthe fact that this file is owned\nby root is not a big deal.\n\n1445\n01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:26.225\nYou might wanna change the group to be lp,\nlp is line printer.\n\n1446\n01:18:26.225 --> 01:18:27.780\nThat's part of the printer service.\n\n1447\n01:18:27.780 --> 01:18:30.480\nYou might wanna consider changing that,\nbut it's not really a requirement.\n\n1448\n01:18:30.480 --> 01:18:32.800\nIt will work if it's\nleft the way that it is.\n\n1449\n01:18:32.800 --> 01:18:37.340\nBut I'll go ahead and\nchange the group of that file, so\n\n1450\n01:18:37.340 --> 01:18:40.780\nI'm using the change group command\nwe saw in an earlier episode.\n\n1451\n01:18:40.780 --> 01:18:44.040\nAnd so now I can see it's\nstill owned by me as root, but\n\n1452\n01:18:44.040 --> 01:18:47.840\nit has been changed to have\nlp as the owner, right?\n\n1453\n01:18:47.840 --> 01:18:49.730\nNow we don't actually execute these files,\nso\n\n1454\n01:18:49.730 --> 01:18:52.410\nI don't need to attach\nthe execute permission to it.\n\n1455\n01:18:52.410 --> 01:18:55.590\nYou know, so as long as we got read\npermissions we'll be able to read it and\n\n1456\n01:18:55.590 --> 01:18:57.880\nuse that to learn how\nto talk to the printer.\n\n1457\n01:18:57.880 --> 01:18:58.720\nThat's what this file is.\n\n1458\n01:18:58.720 --> 01:19:00.220\nThink of it as like, you know,\n\n1459\n01:19:00.220 --> 01:19:03.760\nif I were to go to France I might buy\na English to French dictionary so\n\n1460\n01:19:03.760 --> 01:19:06.208\nthat I could go and order a cup of coffee,\nI look it up in my dictionary.\n\n1461\n01:19:06.208 --> 01:19:08.280\nWell, that's kind of how this PPD is.\n\n1462\n01:19:08.280 --> 01:19:13.000\nIf I wanna print to that printer,\nit's got how to translate my stuff\n\n1463\n01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:17.340\ninto a pattern that that\nprinter will understand, okay?\n\n1464\n01:19:17.340 --> 01:19:19.010\nAnd so that's what's inside of that file.\n\n1465\n01:19:19.010 --> 01:19:22.690\nAnd it's a big file, it's 134 K, so\nit's got a ton of stuff in there.\n\n1466\n01:19:22.690 --> 01:19:25.760\nIt's a binary file, there's not\nreally any point in opening it.\n\n1467\n01:19:25.760 --> 01:19:28.885\nBut it just has that\ntranslation information.\n\n1468\n01:19:28.885 --> 01:19:30.720\n>> Mm-hm, so what, so Don, so\n\n1469\n01:19:30.720 --> 01:19:33.660\nthat means is it essentially\nlike a driver in that case, or?\n\n1470\n01:19:33.660 --> 01:19:35.310\n>> Yeah, yeah, that's basically it, mm-hm.\n\n1471\n01:19:35.310 --> 01:19:36.180\n>> All right, great.\n\n1472\n01:19:36.180 --> 01:19:40.910\n>> Yep, all right, next I just need to\ntell the system that this printer exists.\n\n1473\n01:19:40.910 --> 01:19:43.000\nI need to tell it that it's there and\nwhere it is.\n\n1474\n01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:47.160\nNow, the printer is a network printer So\nI need to point it to a network port and\n\n1475\n01:19:47.160 --> 01:19:50.485\nthe command I use for that is lpadmin.\n\n1476\n01:19:50.485 --> 01:19:55.221\nlpadmin is a utility that we use\njust to define our printers.\n\n1477\n01:19:55.221 --> 01:19:57.927\nSee how it says configure printers and\nclasses so\n\n1478\n01:19:57.927 --> 01:20:00.508\nyou can define all this stuff and\nget it set up.\n\n1479\n01:20:00.508 --> 01:20:02.929\nAnd when you specify\nwhere that printer is.\n\n1480\n01:20:02.929 --> 01:20:05.222\nIt could be a network printer,\nlike mine is gonna be.\n\n1481\n01:20:05.222 --> 01:20:09.580\nIt could be attached to an LPT,\na line printer port on your computer.\n\n1482\n01:20:09.580 --> 01:20:11.611\nIt could be attached to a USB port.\n\n1483\n01:20:11.611 --> 01:20:15.987\nSo, you would just specify where it\nwas attached and map it from there.\n\n1484\n01:20:15.987 --> 01:20:20.528\nSo, a lots of options in here for\nmanaging that printer.\n\n1485\n01:20:20.528 --> 01:20:27.000\nSo to add mine, what I'm gonna do is\nI'm gonna run lpadmin -h localhost.\n\n1486\n01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.058\nThat means I'm adding\na printer to this server,\n\n1487\n01:20:29.058 --> 01:20:31.527\ncuz I could add a printer to\na different server if I wanted.\n\n1488\n01:20:31.527 --> 01:20:34.194\nSo I'm adding a printer to this server.\n\n1489\n01:20:34.194 --> 01:20:38.487\nThe printer,\nI'm gonna call it a Canon7065.\n\n1490\n01:20:38.487 --> 01:20:41.360\nThis is the name that I'm\ngonna use from now on.\n\n1491\n01:20:41.360 --> 01:20:45.614\nSo that's the name that I'm giving it,\nCanon7065 and\n\n1492\n01:20:45.614 --> 01:20:49.356\nthen I need to tell it that\nit's a network printer and\n\n1493\n01:20:49.356 --> 01:20:52.970\nthat the socket for it is 10.1.10.23.\n\n1494\n01:20:52.970 --> 01:20:56.570\nThat's the IP address\nof the network printer.\n\n1495\n01:20:56.570 --> 01:21:02.015\nIf this were an LPT or whatever,\nthen I would say, socket colon LPT one or\n\n1496\n01:21:02.015 --> 01:21:07.486\nwhatever to specify the port that it\nwas on or USB zero or wherever it was.\n\n1497\n01:21:07.486 --> 01:21:12.617\nAnd then we throw in -P, so\nthat it knows the PPD file to use and\n\n1498\n01:21:12.617 --> 01:21:16.564\nI do need to specify\nthe full path to that thing,\n\n1499\n01:21:16.564 --> 01:21:21.319\nwhich is we'll tab,\ntab autocomplete, save as a.\n\n1500\n01:21:21.319 --> 01:21:23.320\n[LAUGH] So, there we go.\n\n1501\n01:21:23.320 --> 01:21:26.029\nI'm telling it what PPD file to use.\n\n1502\n01:21:26.029 --> 01:21:27.528\nSo, there's the full syntax.\n\n1503\n01:21:27.528 --> 01:21:31.694\nI'm basically gonna create\na virtual printer called Canon7065.\n\n1504\n01:21:31.694 --> 01:21:32.948\nHere's the PPD to use and\n\n1505\n01:21:32.948 --> 01:21:36.580\nhere's the IP address that\nthe printer just send the data to it.\n\n1506\n01:21:36.580 --> 01:21:40.626\nSo now if I generate a print job,\nit'll know the IP to send it to and\n\n1507\n01:21:40.626 --> 01:21:44.986\nit'll know how to translate it to\na way that printer will understand.\n\n1508\n01:21:44.986 --> 01:21:48.010\nNow I've got a printer, very exciting.\n\n1509\n01:21:48.010 --> 01:21:50.986\nI've got the printer,\nit's define and I'm ready to print.\n\n1510\n01:21:50.986 --> 01:21:53.472\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I know,\n\n1511\n01:21:53.472 --> 01:21:55.527\nit's really not as exciting\nas we make it out to be.\n\n1512\n01:21:55.527 --> 01:21:56.069\nIt's kind of lame.\n\n1513\n01:21:56.069 --> 01:22:00.473\n>> [LAUGH] So now if I wanna print,\nI need some kind of a document and\n\n1514\n01:22:00.473 --> 01:22:02.690\ndidn't I create one earlier?\n\n1515\n01:22:03.730 --> 01:22:07.652\nWas the name file1.txt that\nwe converted from, yeah.\n\n1516\n01:22:07.652 --> 01:22:10.527\nSo, I've got this file1.text right\nhere that we made it earlier.\n\n1517\n01:22:10.527 --> 01:22:16.080\nI converted this one from\nLatin one to UTFA or whatever.\n\n1518\n01:22:16.080 --> 01:22:18.098\nSo if I wanna print this file out,\nI can and\n\n1519\n01:22:18.098 --> 01:22:21.111\nwe've got series of commands\nthat are available to command.\n\n1520\n01:22:21.111 --> 01:22:25.260\nI'm gonna use is LP,\nmy line printer command.\n\n1521\n01:22:25.260 --> 01:22:26.944\nAnd basically, I'm gonna print to it.\n\n1522\n01:22:26.944 --> 01:22:31.027\nI need to tell it the destination,\nwhich is gonna be Canon7065.\n\n1523\n01:22:31.027 --> 01:22:34.802\nThat's that name I created for that\nprinter, so I'm gonna name it this way and\n\n1524\n01:22:34.802 --> 01:22:36.932\nthen I need to tell it\nwhat I'm gonna print.\n\n1525\n01:22:36.932 --> 01:22:40.650\nI'm gonna print file1.text.\n\n1526\n01:22:40.650 --> 01:22:41.530\nSo as the end user,\n\n1527\n01:22:41.530 --> 01:22:44.569\nI just need to know the name of\nthe printer in the file I wanna send.\n\n1528\n01:22:44.569 --> 01:22:47.560\nI don't have to know all the other stuff,\nthat was all mapped with LP admin.\n\n1529\n01:22:49.040 --> 01:22:52.147\nSo when I run that,\nit's gonna generate the print job and\n\n1530\n01:22:52.147 --> 01:22:54.362\nit's gonna stick it into a print queue.\n\n1531\n01:22:54.362 --> 01:22:56.256\nNow it shouldn't stay\nin the queue very long,\n\n1532\n01:22:56.256 --> 01:22:58.403\nit should get sent to the printer and\nthen print out.\n\n1533\n01:22:58.403 --> 01:23:01.071\nAnd now whoever's sitting by that\nprinter is probably wondering,\n\n1534\n01:23:01.071 --> 01:23:01.995\nwhat the heck is this?\n\n1535\n01:23:01.995 --> 01:23:04.611\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So some of the, it should go.\n\n1536\n01:23:04.611 --> 01:23:06.200\nIt could always get stuck.\n\n1537\n01:23:06.200 --> 01:23:09.928\nSo I could do lpstat and lpstat,\n\n1538\n01:23:09.928 --> 01:23:15.320\nyou can do lpstat -P and\nspecify the printer.\n\n1539\n01:23:15.320 --> 01:23:17.530\nAnd so if I got a job that's in there,\nI would see it.\n\n1540\n01:23:17.530 --> 01:23:21.031\nI see the printer is idle, it's ready\nto print and it's just sitting there.\n\n1541\n01:23:21.031 --> 01:23:22.736\nSo, that means my job is already gone.\n\n1542\n01:23:22.736 --> 01:23:27.777\nSo, my job went to the printer and\nis likely sitting on the tray out there.\n\n1543\n01:23:27.777 --> 01:23:31.765\nIf there was still a job though, it would\ncertainly sitting here stuck in the queue.\n\n1544\n01:23:31.765 --> 01:23:35.725\nAnd if we had an issue with the printer,\nit would say what the issue was.\n\n1545\n01:23:35.725 --> 01:23:38.939\nYou can also run lpstat -a and\nthis is what I normally run,\n\n1546\n01:23:38.939 --> 01:23:42.694\nbecause it's a rare day that I can\nremember the name of the printer.\n\n1547\n01:23:42.694 --> 01:23:48.262\nSo when I run lpstat -a, it's nice, cuz it\ngives you a list of all the printers and\n\n1548\n01:23:48.262 --> 01:23:52.403\nthen you can rush lpstat -P and\nthen the name of the printer.\n\n1549\n01:23:52.403 --> 01:23:55.899\nSo LPstat -a is really nice,\nit gives you a summary and\n\n1550\n01:23:55.899 --> 01:23:58.569\nthen you can find the details from there.\n\n1551\n01:23:58.569 --> 01:24:02.418\nSo lpstat -a is a little more general,\nshows that the printer is up and\n\n1552\n01:24:02.418 --> 01:24:04.580\nit's happy or if it's down.\n\n1553\n01:24:04.580 --> 01:24:05.777\nIf it's got a problem, you can see it.\n\n1554\n01:24:05.777 --> 01:24:10.943\nUseful for troubleshooting.\n\n1555\n01:24:10.943 --> 01:24:15.770\nIf my job was stuck, if my job was still\nin there, the job would have a number.\n\n1556\n01:24:15.770 --> 01:24:18.382\nSo each job has a number beside it and\n\n1557\n01:24:18.382 --> 01:24:22.486\nyou can use the cancel command\nto cancel the print jobs.\n\n1558\n01:24:22.486 --> 01:24:25.700\nAnd so I would just come in and\nbasically say,\n\n1559\n01:24:25.700 --> 01:24:30.530\ncancel Canon7065- and\nwhatever the number the print job was.\n\n1560\n01:24:30.530 --> 01:24:33.570\nSo if it was the first print job,\nI would run it like that.\n\n1561\n01:24:33.570 --> 01:24:36.831\nCancel Cannon7065-1 and\nsee how it says here,\n\n1562\n01:24:36.831 --> 01:24:39.736\njob one is already completed,\ncan't cancel.\n\n1563\n01:24:39.736 --> 01:24:41.740\nSo, it's already gong through that.\n\n1564\n01:24:41.740 --> 01:24:46.726\nBut if the job hadn't already printed,\nif it was still sitting there,\n\n1565\n01:24:46.726 --> 01:24:49.152\nI'd be able to grab it and cancel.\n\n1566\n01:24:49.152 --> 01:24:50.541\n>> So Don, so let's say,\n\n1567\n01:24:50.541 --> 01:24:54.440\nyou've got a lot of printers installed and\nthose sorts of things.\n\n1568\n01:24:54.440 --> 01:24:57.657\nNow when you go to print something,\nyou got to call the printer name,\n\n1569\n01:24:57.657 --> 01:25:01.110\nif you've got like a lot of printer\nnames and a lot of printers installed.\n\n1570\n01:25:01.110 --> 01:25:06.487\nCan you set one just to print right away,\nlike my go-to printer?\n\n1571\n01:25:06.487 --> 01:25:08.611\n>> Yeah, you can create a default printer.\n\n1572\n01:25:08.611 --> 01:25:12.082\nAnd now that I think about it, I can't\nremember if it sets a default printer for\n\n1573\n01:25:12.082 --> 01:25:13.640\nus automatically or not.\n\n1574\n01:25:13.640 --> 01:25:16.736\nDefault printers are really easy to set,\nit's set with an environment variable.\n\n1575\n01:25:16.736 --> 01:25:20.442\nSo, end users can modify their\nown profile, their bashrc\n\n1576\n01:25:20.442 --> 01:25:25.055\nfile to include a variable that defines\nwhat their default printer is and\n\n1577\n01:25:25.055 --> 01:25:27.944\nI can't remember off\nhand if one is created.\n\n1578\n01:25:27.944 --> 01:25:32.694\nThe easy way is a variable called\nLPDEST or line printer destination.\n\n1579\n01:25:32.694 --> 01:25:38.560\nAnd so if we do an echo $LPDEST, whatever\nyou get back is your default printer.\n\n1580\n01:25:38.560 --> 01:25:41.069\nAnd so in my case, I don't have one set.\n\n1581\n01:25:41.069 --> 01:25:45.489\nSo if I want a default printer, a printer\nthat I use if I don't specify a name,\n\n1582\n01:25:45.489 --> 01:25:47.403\nI can define it in that variable.\n\n1583\n01:25:47.403 --> 01:25:52.125\nAnd if we just do it temporarily,\nif I say,\n\n1584\n01:25:52.125 --> 01:25:55.152\nLPDEST=Canon7065.\n\n1585\n01:25:55.152 --> 01:25:58.068\nNow when I echo that variable,\nI get Canon7065.\n\n1586\n01:25:58.068 --> 01:26:02.100\nThat's now my default, but\nwhat's gonna happen when I logout?\n\n1587\n01:26:02.100 --> 01:26:03.652\nVariable is cleared.\n\n1588\n01:26:03.652 --> 01:26:07.913\nSo we want that one to stick around,\nwe should put it in our .profile or\n\n1589\n01:26:07.913 --> 01:26:08.862\nour .bashrc.\n\n1590\n01:26:08.862 --> 01:26:13.800\nRemember, in our own profile folder,\nwe've got .bashrc.\n\n1591\n01:26:13.800 --> 01:26:16.736\nAnd in there,\nyou can set aliases and variables.\n\n1592\n01:26:16.736 --> 01:26:18.861\nSo, we can define them there.\n\n1593\n01:26:18.861 --> 01:26:23.652\nWe've also got bash_profile.\n\n1594\n01:26:23.652 --> 01:26:27.040\nAnd in here, you'll see some other\nvariables that are getting set.\n\n1595\n01:26:27.040 --> 01:26:29.861\nIt is same result whether you\nput them in one or other.\n\n1596\n01:26:29.861 --> 01:26:32.958\nSo I could say,\n\n1597\n01:26:32.958 --> 01:26:38.444\nLPDEST=Canon7065.\n\n1598\n01:26:38.444 --> 01:26:41.936\nAnd now every time I reboot,\nwhen I come in here and login,\n\n1599\n01:26:41.936 --> 01:26:44.235\nI'll have that default printer set.\n\n1600\n01:26:44.235 --> 01:26:46.569\nSo, that's an easy way to deal with that.\n\n1601\n01:26:46.569 --> 01:26:48.111\n>> Nice.\n\n1602\n01:26:48.111 --> 01:26:51.993\n>> Now the whole printing subsystem\nhas evolved a lot over the years and\n\n1603\n01:26:51.993 --> 01:26:56.146\nthe commands that I've been showing you so\nfar, those are the current,\n\n1604\n01:26:56.146 --> 01:26:58.940\nwhat are considered the modern commands.\n\n1605\n01:26:58.940 --> 01:27:04.611\nBut back before CUPS came about, the Unix\nworld had really, really crappy printing.\n\n1606\n01:27:04.611 --> 01:27:08.736\n[LAUGH] And so in the BSD world,\nremember, BSD is a fork of Unix.\n\n1607\n01:27:08.736 --> 01:27:11.580\nAnd they did it, because they\nwere improving a lot of tools.\n\n1608\n01:27:11.580 --> 01:27:15.548\nBSD started to make their own tools and\nthey were good, people liked them for\n\n1609\n01:27:15.548 --> 01:27:16.236\na long time.\n\n1610\n01:27:16.236 --> 01:27:20.139\nBut when CUPS came out and\nkinda fill that need in the Unix world,\n\n1611\n01:27:20.139 --> 01:27:22.902\neverybody went back to\nthe old Unix command.\n\n1612\n01:27:22.902 --> 01:27:27.384\nSo now we actually have two sets of\ncommands we can use for managing this and\n\n1613\n01:27:27.384 --> 01:27:30.730\nI went ahead, and\nput them all in my notes for the show.\n\n1614\n01:27:30.730 --> 01:27:33.920\nLet me see if I can find that,\nright here at the end.\n\n1615\n01:27:33.920 --> 01:27:39.820\nSo you have your System V commands,\nthose are your original Unix commands.\n\n1616\n01:27:39.820 --> 01:27:41.702\nAnd then you have your BSD commands,\n\n1617\n01:27:41.702 --> 01:27:46.480\nthose were the newer ones created under\nBSD that we've now kinda moved away from.\n\n1618\n01:27:46.480 --> 01:27:52.986\nSo the lp command that I use to print\nwith, well, under BSD, it's lpr, right?\n\n1619\n01:27:52.986 --> 01:28:00.495\nWell on my system, if I run lp,\nI get lp prints files.\n\n1620\n01:28:00.495 --> 01:28:05.268\nAnd if I do a man lpr,\nI get lpr prints files.\n\n1621\n01:28:05.268 --> 01:28:07.198\nThey're effectively the same command.\n\n1622\n01:28:07.198 --> 01:28:10.677\nThe old Command is kind of\nthe one we've gone back to, so\n\n1623\n01:28:10.677 --> 01:28:16.180\nthat's the System 5 command lp, but\nlpr the bsd command is still there.\n\n1624\n01:28:16.180 --> 01:28:19.160\nThe recommendation is,\nif you're using cups,\n\n1625\n01:28:19.160 --> 01:28:24.140\nyou should use the System 5 commands,\nthe older style Unix commands.\n\n1626\n01:28:24.140 --> 01:28:27.130\nSo, lp and lpr, those are the same.\n\n1627\n01:28:27.130 --> 01:28:28.350\nlpstat?\n\n1628\n01:28:28.350 --> 01:28:32.080\nI used to see the print queues,\nthe BSD Command is lpq.\n\n1629\n01:28:32.080 --> 01:28:36.180\nAgain, same command, and\nthen cancel is what I use to stop the job.\n\n1630\n01:28:36.180 --> 01:28:39.330\nThat's a System 5 command,\nunder BSD it's lprm\n\n1631\n01:28:40.490 --> 01:28:45.350\nAs in remove a print job,\nso lprm, same thing.\n\n1632\n01:28:45.350 --> 01:28:49.760\nOn most distros, both sets of commands\nwork, you can use either one, right?\n\n1633\n01:28:49.760 --> 01:28:53.440\nFor the exam, you should be familiar with\nboth, but if they ever ask you a question\n\n1634\n01:28:53.440 --> 01:28:56.230\nabout which command to use,\nyou always want to use the System 5 one.\n\n1635\n01:28:56.230 --> 01:28:59.815\nYou want to use the UNIX command.\n\n1636\n01:28:59.815 --> 01:29:00.780\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So, little\n\n1637\n01:29:00.780 --> 01:29:02.930\nvariations in printing there,\nit makes things exciting.\n\n1638\n01:29:03.940 --> 01:29:07.811\n>> So, where's the command to\ntell it to print and draft, or\n\n1639\n01:29:07.811 --> 01:29:10.579\nto print and color, or duplex printing?\n\n1640\n01:29:10.579 --> 01:29:11.996\nPrint landscape, portrait?\n\n1641\n01:29:11.996 --> 01:29:15.840\n>> All those advanced features, yeah,\nthat comes down to the driver, right, and\n\n1642\n01:29:15.840 --> 01:29:18.008\nsome drivers will have advanced functions.\n\n1643\n01:29:18.008 --> 01:29:22.500\nThat 7065, it's got the staple pages and\ndo double sided printing and stuff, and\n\n1644\n01:29:22.500 --> 01:29:26.560\nthose are options that you\ncan pass with the LP command.\n\n1645\n01:29:26.560 --> 01:29:30.040\nWhen you, and\nyou can pass them with lpadmin also.\n\n1646\n01:29:30.040 --> 01:29:31.350\nIn lpadmin,\n\n1647\n01:29:31.350 --> 01:29:36.760\nthere were a lot of other options in here\nas far as specifying model, banners for\n\n1648\n01:29:36.760 --> 01:29:40.820\nthe sheets, you've got all sorts of\nstuff in your printer error policies.\n\n1649\n01:29:40.820 --> 01:29:45.580\nAnd you can go through and define quite\na few different things that are tied\n\n1650\n01:29:45.580 --> 01:29:50.290\nto that, to that PPD file and\nsame thing goes with the LP command.\n\n1651\n01:29:50.290 --> 01:29:54.760\nYou'll see options in here for specifying\nthings like the number of copies,\n\n1652\n01:29:54.760 --> 01:29:59.290\nthe priority that gets assigned to it and\nother types of things, so\n\n1653\n01:29:59.290 --> 01:30:03.210\nit just depends on what your\nprinter supports, all right?\n\n1654\n01:30:03.210 --> 01:30:04.830\nYeah, so here's the media size landscape,\n\n1655\n01:30:04.830 --> 01:30:07.270\nthose are some of the ones\nthat you were talking about.\n\n1656\n01:30:07.270 --> 01:30:10.550\nOne sided, two sided, all right,\nhere in the LP command.\n\n1657\n01:30:10.550 --> 01:30:14.160\nNo, I don't see staple as an option.\n\n1658\n01:30:14.160 --> 01:30:16.770\nSo yeah, we might not have that one.\n\n1659\n01:30:16.770 --> 01:30:18.818\nLet me do this, I'm just curious now.\n\n1660\n01:30:18.818 --> 01:30:23.890\nNope, I left\n\n1661\n01:30:23.890 --> 01:30:28.790\nthe letter S off because I didn't know if\nit would be capital or lower case [LAUGH].\n\n1662\n01:30:28.790 --> 01:30:32.250\nSo anyhow I don't see how we could staple.\n\n1663\n01:30:32.250 --> 01:30:34.270\nBut some drivers may have that option and\n\n1664\n01:30:34.270 --> 01:30:36.300\nyou can pass it along\ndepending on that system.\n\n1665\n01:30:36.300 --> 01:30:39.150\nSo anyhow,\nyou've got a lot of functionality.\n\n1666\n01:30:39.150 --> 01:30:40.300\nIt's not very easy.\n\n1667\n01:30:40.300 --> 01:30:42.290\nIn the graphical interface\nit's super easy.\n\n1668\n01:30:42.290 --> 01:30:44.730\nIt gives you a little screen and\nyou pick your options and you're done.\n\n1669\n01:30:44.730 --> 01:30:48.590\nBut in the text-based CLI,\nit's a little more sparse.\n\n1670\n01:30:48.590 --> 01:30:52.910\nAll right, so what I just showed you,\nwhat did that take us?\n\n1671\n01:30:52.910 --> 01:30:54.230\n15 minutes maybe?\n\n1672\n01:30:54.230 --> 01:30:56.790\nSo it didn't take us very long to\ntake a loot at Internet printing,\n\n1673\n01:30:56.790 --> 01:31:00.930\nI will tell you ten years ago,\nI had to set up a printer and\n\n1674\n01:31:00.930 --> 01:31:03.211\nit took me the better of a day\nto get it working in Unix.\n\n1675\n01:31:03.211 --> 01:31:05.930\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And that's just because it really,\n\n1676\n01:31:05.930 --> 01:31:07.300\nthere was no common system.\n\n1677\n01:31:07.300 --> 01:31:10.310\nSo you had to do all sorts of\nkluges to get drivers working.\n\n1678\n01:31:10.310 --> 01:31:14.010\nYou had to feed things through ghost\nscript to translate them into a format\n\n1679\n01:31:14.010 --> 01:31:17.210\nthat would then work on a post script\nprinter, it was just a nightmare.\n\n1680\n01:31:17.210 --> 01:31:22.590\nCups makes it a lot Easier,\nit really does simplify things.\n\n1681\n01:31:22.590 --> 01:31:24.580\nSo\n>> It was a different time back then.\n\n1682\n01:31:24.580 --> 01:31:25.530\n>> It really was.\n\n1683\n01:31:25.530 --> 01:31:29.058\nIf you're new to Linux, you are spoiled.\n\n1684\n01:31:29.058 --> 01:31:32.530\n[LAUGH] You might be looking at\nthat command line stuff and going,\n\n1685\n01:31:32.530 --> 01:31:36.050\n\"Man that's hard It was so\nmuch harder [LAUGH] in the past.\n\n1686\n01:31:36.050 --> 01:31:38.970\nSo difficult to get even simple task done.\n\n1687\n01:31:38.970 --> 01:31:40.220\nIt's evolved a lot.\n\n1688\n01:31:40.220 --> 01:31:42.020\nIt just shows the nature of Linux.\n\n1689\n01:31:42.020 --> 01:31:46.070\nWe have thousands of\ndevelopers putting in request,\n\n1690\n01:31:46.070 --> 01:31:49.020\nputting in updates to\nthe code every single day.\n\n1691\n01:31:49.020 --> 01:31:51.360\nIt just gets better and better and better.\n\n1692\n01:31:51.360 --> 01:31:53.155\nAnd Linux today,\nit's a world of difference.\n\n1693\n01:31:53.155 --> 01:31:53.655\n[INAUDIBLE]\n>> Nice.\n\n1694\n01:31:55.630 --> 01:31:59.500\n>> All right, where that wraps up\nour essential services, right?\n\n1695\n01:31:59.500 --> 01:32:04.240\nSo there were three essential services,\nthere was syslog for our message logging,\n\n1696\n01:32:04.240 --> 01:32:10.790\nThere was the MTA for email transporter\nand then there was cups for printing.\n\n1697\n01:32:10.790 --> 01:32:12.940\nSo those are our three essential services.\n\n1698\n01:32:12.940 --> 01:32:17.080\nThey're pretty much gonna be installed and\non by default in almost every dish.\n\n1699\n01:32:17.080 --> 01:32:19.080\nNot all of them but on most of them.\n\n1700\n01:32:19.080 --> 01:32:22.730\nAnd they're pretty consistent across\nthe dish o's as far as configuration.\n\n1701\n01:32:22.730 --> 01:32:24.680\nSo those are essential services.\n\n1702\n01:32:24.680 --> 01:32:26.290\nNow I did do one thing a little\nbit different Different.\n\n1703\n01:32:26.290 --> 01:32:28.520\nIf you're following along in\nthe objectives, you might say,\n\n1704\n01:32:28.520 --> 01:32:29.810\nDon, you skipped NTP.\n\n1705\n01:32:29.810 --> 01:32:32.980\nWell, that's because we covered NTP\nback in the localization section.\n\n1706\n01:32:32.980 --> 01:32:36.640\nSo it's kind of covered in\ntwo sets of objectives, so\n\n1707\n01:32:36.640 --> 01:32:38.300\nwe covered it in that other episode.\n\n1708\n01:32:38.300 --> 01:32:43.820\nSo if you're wondering where NTP is,\nthis is, what are we on, episode 13?\n\n1709\n01:32:43.820 --> 01:32:44.440\n>> Yeah.\n\n1710\n01:32:44.440 --> 01:32:45.070\n>> I think.\nSo\n\n1711\n01:32:45.070 --> 01:32:47.620\nthat was back in episode\n12 that we tackled NTP.\n\n1712\n01:32:47.620 --> 01:32:51.070\nSo just jump over to that one and\nyou can Catch it there.\n\n1713\n01:32:51.070 --> 01:32:52.630\nNate, can you think of anything else?\n\n1714\n01:32:52.630 --> 01:32:55.930\n>> No, but I was hoping for\nsome more fancy printer stuff,\n\n1715\n01:32:55.930 --> 01:33:00.320\nyou know printers it seems is a big\nthing but very very simplified here and\n\n1716\n01:33:00.320 --> 01:33:02.530\ngetting that printer up and running.\n\n1717\n01:33:02.530 --> 01:33:06.110\n>> Yeah, and the exam remember the exam\nis trying to be vendor neutral and\n\n1718\n01:33:06.110 --> 01:33:07.400\nall that\n>> So\n\n1719\n01:33:07.400 --> 01:33:10.610\nwhen it comes to printers all the advanced\nstuff, it varies from printer to printer,\n\n1720\n01:33:10.610 --> 01:33:14.600\nso that's why they focus in on the basics,\ngetting it working.\n\n1721\n01:33:14.600 --> 01:33:15.220\n>> Right.\n\n1722\n01:33:15.220 --> 01:33:19.950\n>> All right, well let me just remind you\nguys if you have questions on any of this\n\n1723\n01:33:19.950 --> 01:33:20.720\n>> Live during the show.\n\n1724\n01:33:20.720 --> 01:33:24.740\nYou can go to itpro.tv/live, you'll see\nthe chat room right beneath the

00:00:36.704\nAll right, good morning,\ngood afternoon, and good evening and\n\n5\n00:00:36.704 --> 00:00:38.940\nwelcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.852\nI'm your host, Don Pezet,\nback again with Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n7\n00:00:41.852 --> 00:00:43.141\nHow's it going, Ronnie?\n\n8\n00:00:43.141 --> 00:00:48.695\n>> It is the least exciting entertainment\nnewsday ever in the history of mankind.\n\n9\n00:00:48.695 --> 00:00:49.330\n>> [LAUGH] Shocking.\n\n10\n00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:54.320\n>> The only thing I could find was that\nSarah Jessica Parker is coming back to TV,\n\n11\n00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.920\nand how much excitement\ncan you have with that?\n\n12\n00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.300\n>> Now we have the first two signs\nof the apocalypse last time.\n\n13\n00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.354\nI don't remember what they were now.\n\n14\n00:01:01.354 --> 00:01:03.058\n>> Yeah [LAUGH].\n\n15\n00:01:03.058 --> 00:01:04.310\n>> So now we've got that.\n\n16\n00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:05.648\nWe just need what,\nLindsay Lohan getting a leading role and\n\n17\n00:01:05.648 --> 00:01:06.380\nthen it's-\n>> Yeah,\n\n18\n00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.760\nwe did reference the idea of a Captain\n& Tennille song this morning too.\n\n19\n00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:11.675\n>> All the pieces of the puzzle\nare falling together.\n\n20\n00:01:11.675 --> 00:01:14.408\n>> They are falling together.\n\n21\n00:01:14.408 --> 00:01:17.070\n>> As we say every time we launch\nan episode with a reference to Captain &\n\n22\n00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.650\nTennille, you know it's gonna\nbe an excellent episode\n\n23\n00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:21.410\n>> Today we've got kind\n\n24\n00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:22.440\nof a short episode.\n\n25\n00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.006\nWe're gonna be tackling networking.\n\n26\n00:01:24.006 --> 00:01:28.975\nNow, it's the CompTIA Linux+ that\nwe're studying and preparing for, or\n\n27\n00:01:28.975 --> 00:01:31.475\nreally the LPIC-1 certification.\n\n28\n00:01:31.475 --> 00:01:34.710\nAnd networking is really\njust a small portion of it.\n\n29\n00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.250\nBut CompTIA also has the CompTIA Network+\ncertification that just goes super mega\n\n30\n00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:39.950\nin depth.\n\n31\n00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.210\nThere is a lot to know about networking.\n\n32\n00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.860\nWhat we're concerned with here\nis networking inside of Linux.\n\n33\n00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.080\nAnd so we're gonna take a look at\nhow to setup the network card and\n\n34\n00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.080\nhow to do some basic configurations.\n\n35\n00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.430\nAnd how to troubleshoot\nif we're having issues.\n\n36\n00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.690\nIf we can't get on the network, if we're\nhaving some kind of problem there.\n\n37\n00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.830\nAnd you'll find that configuring\na network card on a Linux box\n\n38\n00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.980\nis not necessarily the easiest\nthing on the planet.\n\n39\n00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:07.650\nA lot of the distros have graphical\nutilities that they use that are unique to\n\n40\n00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:10.810\nthat distro and that would make it\nconfiguring things really, really easy.\n\n41\n00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.400\nSo Ubuntu has a super cool network\npanel that works almost flawlessly,\n\n42\n00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.070\nyou rarely have to go to it.\n\n43\n00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:21.130\nRed Hat and the CentOS have the network\nmanager which is pretty cool too,\n\n44\n00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:22.110\nworks great.\n\n45\n00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:23.610\nBut they're graphical, right?\n\n46\n00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.390\nSo, if you're working on the command\nline world, like we are for this exam,\n\n47\n00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.360\nyou need to know how to actually set this\nup using the config files on the back end.\n\n48\n00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:32.790\nAnd there are many,\n\n49\n00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.060\nmany different config files that are\ninvolved in your network interface, right?\n\n50\n00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.030\nSo we're gonna take a look at that.\n\n51\n00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.939\nNow just to make sure we've got our\nall bases covered, on the exam,\n\n52\n00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:46.700\nthey do expect you to already have\na basic knowledge of networking.\n\n53\n00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.001\nNow if you don't have any\nexperience with IPv4 and IPv6,\n\n54\n00:02:51.001 --> 00:02:56.080\nwhat I encourage you to do is to\njump over to our Network+ show.\n\n55\n00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.970\nIt's part of your subscription\nas a member of ITProTV,\n\n56\n00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:00.900\nwe don't charge like per course or\nwhatever.\n\n57\n00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.730\nYou can jump over whenever you want.\n\n58\n00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:06.760\nAnd we go in depth, the history, the\nbackground, how it works, everything you\n\n59\n00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.050\never wanted to know and probably stuff-\n>> More.\n\n60\n00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:11.130\n>> You didn't wanna know about networking.\n\n61\n00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:12.900\nIt's a great resource.\n\n62\n00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.570\nBut I do wanna summarize a few ideas right\nhere at the beginning just to make sure.\n\n63\n00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:18.880\nAnd you can use this as a test.\n\n64\n00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.010\nYou can say, all right, if I recognize\neverything Don's talking about,\n\n65\n00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:22.790\nthen I'm good to go.\n\n66\n00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:24.880\nI don't really need to study more on that.\n\n67\n00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.390\nBut if some of this you don't know,\nwell jump over to that Network+ show,\n\n68\n00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:29.500\nyou'll get a great explanation.\n\n69\n00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.800\nSo what are some of the things\nthat we need to be aware of?\n\n70\n00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:37.575\nWell, let me pull up my little\nnotes which I buried away there.\n\n71\n00:03:37.575 --> 00:03:40.855\nAll right,\non the exam they expect you to have\n\n72\n00:03:40.855 --> 00:03:42.715\ncertain background\nknowledge on networking.\n\n73\n00:03:42.715 --> 00:03:44.875\nAnd this is not necessarily Linux related.\n\n74\n00:03:44.875 --> 00:03:48.720\nThis is networking in general,\nregardless of what your OS is.\n\n75\n00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.154\nYou need to have this basic knowledge.\n\n76\n00:03:50.154 --> 00:03:55.148\nSo, the first thing you need to be\naware of is, how an IP address and\n\n77\n00:03:55.148 --> 00:03:57.213\nsubnet mask works, okay?\n\n78\n00:03:57.213 --> 00:04:00.500\nNormally when we get an IP address,\nit's two pieces.\n\n79\n00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:06.084\nThere's the IP address,\nsomething like 192.168.0.1.\n\n80\n00:04:06.084 --> 00:04:08.254\nAnd there's the subnet mask,\n\n81\n00:04:08.254 --> 00:04:13.525\nwhich is normally something\nlike 255.255.255.0, right?\n\n82\n00:04:13.525 --> 00:04:15.462\nSomething like that, okay?\n\n83\n00:04:15.462 --> 00:04:20.131\nThose are IP addresses and\nwhat they're signifying is,\n\n84\n00:04:20.131 --> 00:04:24.980\npart of this address is\nreferring to my network.\n\n85\n00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:29.670\nAnd part of this address is referring\nto my machine, or this particular node,\n\n86\n00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:31.570\nit's got that entry.\n\n87\n00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:33.708\nAnd the subnet mask is telling\nme where that division is.\n\n88\n00:04:33.708 --> 00:04:38.869\nBy seeing 255.255.255 right here,\nthat's telling me the first 3 values,\n\n89\n00:04:38.869 --> 00:04:42.700\nthey're called octets cuz\nthey're made up of 8 bits each.\n\n90\n00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:45.586\nThe first 3 octets represent the network,\nand\n\n91\n00:04:45.586 --> 00:04:49.570\nthe last octet is a 1 here,\nthe 0 tells me that that's the host.\n\n92\n00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:51.534\nSo my host is .1.\n\n93\n00:04:51.534 --> 00:04:55.934\nThere might be a .2, a .3, a .4, those\nare the other computers on my network.\n\n94\n00:04:55.934 --> 00:04:59.987\nAnd as long as their addresses\nstart with 192.168.0,\n\n95\n00:04:59.987 --> 00:05:04.440\nthen I know that they are on the same\nnetwork as me and I can talk to them.\n\n96\n00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:08.080\nRight, now there are three\nmajor classes of addresses.\n\n97\n00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:12.297\nThere's Class A, Class B and Class C and\n\n98\n00:05:12.297 --> 00:05:16.850\neach of them uses a different subnet mask.\n\n99\n00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:21.730\nSo a Class A uses 255.0.0.0,\na Class B uses 255.255.0.0,\n\n100\n00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:27.210\nand a Class C uses that guy right there.\n\n101\n00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:30.120\nAnd so, you'll see,\nit's a difference in how many\n\n102\n00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:34.830\noctets are attached to the network and\nhow many octets are attached to the host.\n\n103\n00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:39.080\nThe more octets you have attached to\nyour host, the more hosts you can have.\n\n104\n00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:40.780\nAnd Ron,\nyou've got these memorized, right?\n\n105\n00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:43.149\nA class A is what, like 16.7 million?\n\n106\n00:05:43.149 --> 00:05:47.134\n>> 16,777,214.\n\n107\n00:05:47.134 --> 00:05:51.429\n>> [LAUGH] 16,770,214?\n\n108\n00:05:51.429 --> 00:05:53.287\n>> 77,000.\n\n109\n00:05:53.287 --> 00:05:55.539\n>> 777,000, like that?\n\n110\n00:05:55.539 --> 00:05:56.407\nHow do you memorize this stuff?\n\n111\n00:05:56.407 --> 00:05:59.366\n[LAUGH] Anyhow,\n>> 2 to the 24th power.\n\n112\n00:05:59.366 --> 00:06:00.340\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah,\n\n113\n00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:01.790\nI know you did that math in your head.\n\n114\n00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:05.390\nAnyhow so,\nyou can have that many hosts on a Class A.\n\n115\n00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:11.054\nAt Class B it is 65,534 or 5?\n\n116\n00:06:11.054 --> 00:06:12.540\n>> 4, yep.\n\n117\n00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:14.166\n>> See, I remember some things.\n\n118\n00:06:14.166 --> 00:06:19.413\nAnd then a Class C is a meager 254 hosts.\n\n119\n00:06:19.413 --> 00:06:23.821\nOkay, so the classes,\nthe more octets we attach to the network,\n\n120\n00:06:23.821 --> 00:06:27.020\nthe fewer hosts we can\nhave on our network.\n\n121\n00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:31.340\nAnd for a home network or a small\nbusiness, 254 hosts is more than enough.\n\n122\n00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:35.440\nAnd so we see Class C\nnetworks almost all the time.\n\n123\n00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:39.020\nBut in a business where you might\nhave well over 250 machines,\n\n124\n00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:43.080\nyou might use Class Bs or\neven Class As to give you enough room.\n\n125\n00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:47.440\nAll right, so that's one concept that\nwe need to be aware of for the exam.\n\n126\n00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:50.840\nJust how IP addresses work and\nwhat those subnet masks mean.\n\n127\n00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:52.170\nAll right, again,\n\n128\n00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:55.440\nif this is the first time you're seeing\nthis stuff, there's a lot more to it,\n\n129\n00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:58.392\nyou should really jump over to that\nNetwork+ show and catch episodes there.\n\n130\n00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:03.393\nAll right,\nthe other thing we need to be aware of is,\n\n131\n00:07:03.393 --> 00:07:07.607\nsome addresses are private, and\nsome are public, all right.\n\n132\n00:07:07.607 --> 00:07:10.159\nPrivate IPs,\nyou can use to your heart's content,\n\n133\n00:07:10.159 --> 00:07:14.170\nyou don't have to tell anybody you can\nuse them, you're on your own, all right?\n\n134\n00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:19.240\nPublic IPs are ones that are unique\nacross the entire Internet.\n\n135\n00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:22.570\nAnd the way that uniqueness is\nenforced is that if you wanna use one,\n\n136\n00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:26.590\nyou have to register it with the INA or\none of those other providers.\n\n137\n00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:28.510\nSo you usually have to buy or\n\n138\n00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:33.440\nrent these IP addresses from\na service provider to get them.\n\n139\n00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:37.170\nPrivate IPs, and\nthese are defined in RFC 1918 if you're\n\n140\n00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:39.814\none of those people that likes\nto go read and standards.\n\n141\n00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:45.726\nPrivate IPs, I'm not one of them,\nprivate IPs for the Class A networks,\n\n142\n00:07:45.726 --> 00:07:48.769\nit's really anything that starts with 10.\n\n143\n00:07:48.769 --> 00:07:53.116\nSo 10.x.x.x, that network right there,\n\n144\n00:07:53.116 --> 00:07:57.364\nthat is a private\nClass A that anybody can use.\n\n145\n00:07:57.364 --> 00:08:02.647\nFor Class B, there's 172.16.x.x and\n\n146\n00:08:02.647 --> 00:08:08.985\nthis one kind of ranges\nCuz it goes 172.17.x.x,\n\n147\n00:08:08.985 --> 00:08:15.069\nall the way through 172.31.x.x, all right.\n\n148\n00:08:15.069 --> 00:08:18.989\nThose are class Bs that are available for\nprivate use.\n\n149\n00:08:18.989 --> 00:08:24.167\nAnd then there is 192.168.0.x and\n\n150\n00:08:24.167 --> 00:08:31.977\nthat one likewise continues on, Like that.\n\n151\n00:08:31.977 --> 00:08:36.001\nAll right, so these are all private ranges\nthat you can use inside of your home or\n\n152\n00:08:36.001 --> 00:08:39.845\nbusiness, and you don't have to register\nwith the IANA, you can use them,\n\n153\n00:08:39.845 --> 00:08:40.880\nall right?\n\n154\n00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:44.030\nNow if you use these,\nthese IPs are not allowed on the Internet,\n\n155\n00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:46.010\nthey're actively blocked\nfrom going on the Internet,\n\n156\n00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:48.430\ncuz more than one person is\nprobably using them, right?\n\n157\n00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:54.918\nProbably hundreds of thousands of people\nare using 192.168.0, it's very common.\n\n158\n00:08:54.918 --> 00:08:59.248\nSo in those scenarios you have to use\nsomething like network address translation\n\n159\n00:08:59.248 --> 00:09:01.358\nor whatever to get out to the Internet.\n\n160\n00:09:01.358 --> 00:09:05.598\nNow public IPs,\nnot pubic IPs nice little typo there Don.\n\n161\n00:09:05.598 --> 00:09:09.650\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Public IPs are ones that we have to\n\n162\n00:09:09.650 --> 00:09:11.352\nregister with the INA, and\n\n163\n00:09:11.352 --> 00:09:15.278\nthey basically wrap around\nthe numbers that I just showed you.\n\n164\n00:09:15.278 --> 00:09:20.070\nSo if we took, they start at 1.0.0.0.\n\n165\n00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:29.120\nAnd they go through on the class A side,\nthey go all the way to,\n\n166\n00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:34.670\nlet's see, it runs all the way to 120,\nwell I'm going to exclude 127,\n\n167\n00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:39.448\nso they run all the way\nto 126.255.255.255.\n\n168\n00:09:39.448 --> 00:09:42.356\nOn the class B side.\n\n169\n00:09:42.356 --> 00:09:47.456\nThat's class A,\non the class B side it runs from\n\n170\n00:09:47.456 --> 00:09:55.364\n128.0.0.0 all the way\nto 191.255.255.255 and\n\n171\n00:09:55.364 --> 00:10:01.116\non the class C side it runs from 193 or\nno, 192.\n\n172\n00:10:01.116 --> 00:10:02.516\nShoot I'm wrong on this.\n\n173\n00:10:02.516 --> 00:10:08.616\nIt runs all the way up to 160 or\nno, I was right.\n\n174\n00:10:08.616 --> 00:10:10.796\nI'm not leaving out the private IPs.\n\n175\n00:10:10.796 --> 00:10:15.492\nSo this one actually\nruns from 192.0.0.0 all\n\n176\n00:10:15.492 --> 00:10:20.096\nthe way through 223.255.255.255.\n\n177\n00:10:20.096 --> 00:10:20.836\nThere, sorry.\n\n178\n00:10:20.836 --> 00:10:21.936\nGot a little tongue tied on that one.\n\n179\n00:10:21.936 --> 00:10:24.056\nRambling out these\nnumbers is kind of tough.\n\n180\n00:10:24.056 --> 00:10:27.676\nI'll post these notes with the episodes so\nyou'll have them.\n\n181\n00:10:27.676 --> 00:10:31.616\nThese ranges, you'll notice how\nthey cover the private range.\n\n182\n00:10:31.616 --> 00:10:36.390\nSo like 10., that falls in between 1 and\n126 so we skip over those,\n\n183\n00:10:36.390 --> 00:10:38.330\nthose aren't public.\n\n184\n00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:41.650\nBut these are the class ranges that\nare out there on the Internet.\n\n185\n00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:45.728\nAnd you notice they stop at 233 they\ndon't go all the way up to 255, and\n\n186\n00:10:45.728 --> 00:10:49.813\nthat's because they leave room for\nmulti-cast addresses and research and\n\n187\n00:10:49.813 --> 00:10:50.800\nstuff like that.\n\n188\n00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:53.060\nBut these are the ranges\nthat are out there.\n\n189\n00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:57.240\nIf you see an IP address that falls\nin one of these ranges up here,\n\n190\n00:10:57.240 --> 00:11:00.300\nthat's a private address and it shouldn't\nbe used out there on the Internet.\n\n191\n00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:03.960\nAnd if you see ranges or\nIPs that are in these ranges down here,\n\n192\n00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:08.960\nthat tells us that those are public\nnetworks that are registered with the INA.\n\n193\n00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:10.520\nThese are unique addresses.\n\n194\n00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:15.510\nOnly one person should have that address,\nall right.\n\n195\n00:11:15.510 --> 00:11:18.140\nSo those are some of the public\nversus private addresses out there.\n\n196\n00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:21.720\nYou should be familiar with\nthat difference, all right.\n\n197\n00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:25.930\nThe other thing we need to be aware of are\nthe major protocols that are out there,\n\n198\n00:11:25.930 --> 00:11:28.670\nUDP, TCP, and ICMP.\n\n199\n00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:33.280\nAnd with those guys, let me just\nkinda lay each of these out here.\n\n200\n00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:34.740\nEach one's a little bit different.\n\n201\n00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:36.340\nTCP is the most common.\n\n202\n00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:42.290\nIt is the transmission control protocol,\nall right, and\n\n203\n00:11:42.290 --> 00:11:50.340\nit is a reliable transport mechanism, or\nprotocol or whatever you want to call it.\n\n204\n00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:56.150\nBasically when we use TCP, if I want\nto send a set of data over to Ronnie,\n\n205\n00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:59.380\nTCP builds up that connection,\nstarts transmitting the data.\n\n206\n00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:04.090\nAnd if anything gets lost in transmission\nit provides him a facility to say hey,\n\n207\n00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:06.770\nI missed something, and\nI can re-transmit it.\n\n208\n00:12:06.770 --> 00:12:09.800\nSo it's reliable,\nnot in that it doesn't prevent errors.\n\n209\n00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:10.900\n>> Right.\n>> Errors happen.\n\n210\n00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:13.990\nBut that it can correct\nthe errors after they do happen.\n\n211\n00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:16.550\nAs a result, TCP is the most popular of\n\n212\n00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:19.770\nthe major protocols that we\nuse out there on the Internet.\n\n213\n00:12:19.770 --> 00:12:22.520\nWhen you're browsing to a webpage,\nyou're sending an email,\n\n214\n00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:26.200\nyou're doing things like that, you want to\nmake sure your transmission gets through,\n\n215\n00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:30.030\nTCP is what'll do it.\n\n216\n00:12:30.030 --> 00:12:33.670\nUDP, on the other hand,\nis the user datagram protocol.\n\n217\n00:12:35.410 --> 00:12:42.630\nAnd it is a best effort\ntransport mechanism, all right?\n\n218\n00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:44.840\nIn other words, it's not reliable.\n\n219\n00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:46.260\nIt's gonna throw data out there.\n\n220\n00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:49.140\nIf I sent data to Ronnie using UDP it's\njust going to start throwing it at\n\n221\n00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:50.430\nhim, right?\n\n222\n00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:52.320\nAnd if something gets missed?\n\n223\n00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:54.190\nWell.\n\n224\n00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:56.930\nYep t just keeps,\nit gave it its best shot.\n\n225\n00:12:56.930 --> 00:12:58.620\nIt said, yeah I'll throw it to Ronnie,\ngood luck.\n\n226\n00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:02.000\nAnd then if it gets there great,\nif it doesn't, well too bad, right.\n\n227\n00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.040\nNow, you might say to yourself,\nwhy would I wanna use that?\n\n228\n00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:06.850\nWhy would I ever use UDP?\n\n229\n00:13:06.850 --> 00:13:09.570\nWell we use UDP every single day.\n\n230\n00:13:09.570 --> 00:13:11.678\nWe use it tons of times.\n\n231\n00:13:11.678 --> 00:13:13.218\nWe're actually using it right now.\n\n232\n00:13:13.218 --> 00:13:17.178\nThe video being streamed to your system\nis very likely being sent UDP if you're\n\n233\n00:13:17.178 --> 00:13:18.438\nwatching us live right?\n\n234\n00:13:18.438 --> 00:13:21.138\nIf you're watching us recorded,\nit's probably being sent to you TCP.\n\n235\n00:13:21.138 --> 00:13:24.518\nBut if you're watching this live, it's\nmost likely being sent to you using UDP.\n\n236\n00:13:24.518 --> 00:13:30.448\nAnd the reason is, with live video, or\nwith voice over IP, with live phone calls,\n\n237\n00:13:30.448 --> 00:13:34.938\nif a packet gets dropped,\nyou don't want to pause the call, or\n\n238\n00:13:34.938 --> 00:13:39.431\npause the video while you go and\nretrieve this missing packet,\n\n239\n00:13:39.431 --> 00:13:43.705\nthat delay could be half a second,\nright, for one.\n\n240\n00:13:43.705 --> 00:13:46.225\nBut then if it happens over and\nover again, you keep getting more and\n\n241\n00:13:46.225 --> 00:13:50.920\nmore behind until all of a sudden\nyou're off by several minutes, right?\n\n242\n00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:54.560\nAnd on a phone call that would be\nsuper annoying that would really\n\n243\n00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:56.220\nbreak down that communication.\n\n244\n00:13:56.220 --> 00:14:02.030\nSo for those if we miss a packet\nwe just want to keep on moving.\n\n245\n00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:05.100\nSure the screen,\nmy video might stutter a little bit.\n\n246\n00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:08.420\nI'm waving my hand and all the sudden\nit stops here and jumps to here, right?\n\n247\n00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:08.980\nBig deal.\n\n248\n00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:10.250\nRight, and then just keeps going.\n\n249\n00:14:10.250 --> 00:14:13.880\nOr my audio stutters for a second and you\nhear, bloop like that and it keeps going.\n\n250\n00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:15.210\nKeeps going on.\n\n251\n00:14:15.210 --> 00:14:16.080\nFine.\n>> Yep.\n\n252\n00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:19.391\n>> As long as it keeps you in\nsync with what's live, and\n\n253\n00:14:19.391 --> 00:14:24.437\nthat's where UDP really excels, is\nshowing things that are live, things that\n\n254\n00:14:24.437 --> 00:14:29.288\nwe just really don't have the time to\ndo error correction with, all right.\n\n255\n00:14:29.288 --> 00:14:31.838\nThe last one is ICMP, and\nICMP is kinda special, and dang,\n\n256\n00:14:31.838 --> 00:14:33.728\nI'm just going to throw off my formatting.\n\n257\n00:14:33.728 --> 00:14:35.288\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> There we go.\n\n258\n00:14:35.288 --> 00:14:39.048\n[LAUGH] ICMP, that is\n\n259\n00:14:39.048 --> 00:14:45.248\nthe Internet Control Protocol.\n\n260\n00:14:45.248 --> 00:14:46.608\nIt's Internet or Internetwork?\n\n261\n00:14:46.608 --> 00:14:47.668\n>> I think it's actually Internet.\n\n262\n00:14:47.668 --> 00:14:51.208\n>> Okay, ICMP,\nit's a very powerful protocol.\n\n263\n00:14:51.208 --> 00:14:53.550\nIt's not designed for transmitting data.\n\n264\n00:14:53.550 --> 00:14:59.060\nWhat it's designed for is diagnosing and\nmonitoring network performance.\n\n265\n00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:01.990\nSo it can show you whether or\nnot you have connectivity.\n\n266\n00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:05.210\nIt can show you whether another\nsystem is online or not.\n\n267\n00:15:05.210 --> 00:15:09.230\nIt can show you how much latency is\nin between you and a destination.\n\n268\n00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:12.430\nICMP is perfect for troubleshooting.\n\n269\n00:15:12.430 --> 00:15:17.536\nAnd so we'll see it used in\nutilities like Ping and other\n\n270\n00:15:17.536 --> 00:15:23.819\ntroubleshooting and status protocols,\nthat they're gonna make use of this.\n\n271\n00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:28.290\nSo it's a great protocol for\nthat to be able to find information.\n\n272\n00:15:28.290 --> 00:15:30.420\nICMP is actually a suite of protocols.\n\n273\n00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:32.550\nThere's several things\nthat are inside of it.\n\n274\n00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:35.190\nAnd it all kinda comes into play.\n\n275\n00:15:35.190 --> 00:15:37.550\nIf you were watching live before the show,\n\n276\n00:15:37.550 --> 00:15:39.590\nwe were having a problem\nwith one of our commands.\n\n277\n00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:40.810\nAnd I was actually trouble shooting this.\n\n278\n00:15:40.810 --> 00:15:43.460\nSo some of you might have\ngotten a chance to see it.\n\n279\n00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:46.290\nI know, we're supposed to troubleshoot\nnetworking in Linux today, my problem was\n\n280\n00:15:46.290 --> 00:15:49.360\non a Cisco switch though, so\nthat's why we didn't put it in the show.\n\n281\n00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:51.900\nBut if you wanna see troubleshooting\nthe Cisco switch though,\n\n282\n00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:56.750\nyou can jump over the Cisco show as we\ndo it there in several episodes I think.\n\n283\n00:15:56.750 --> 00:15:59.418\nBut all right, so those are the three\nmajor protocols that we're using.\n\n284\n00:15:59.418 --> 00:16:01.682\nNow these all run on top of IP.\n\n285\n00:16:01.682 --> 00:16:03.678\nIP is the Internet Protocol.\n\n286\n00:16:03.678 --> 00:16:05.779\nIP simply handles addressing.\n\n287\n00:16:05.779 --> 00:16:09.380\nTo help us find where our destination is,\nso we know where we're coming from and\n\n288\n00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:10.830\nwhere we're going to.\n\n289\n00:16:10.830 --> 00:16:13.690\nBut these guys,\nthese are the payload mechanisms.\n\n290\n00:16:13.690 --> 00:16:15.440\nThese are how we actually move our data.\n\n291\n00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:17.776\nSo, you want to be familiar with those.\n\n292\n00:16:17.776 --> 00:16:21.617\nNow, all the software that we run,\nwhen it communicates over the network,\n\n293\n00:16:21.617 --> 00:16:23.717\nif we're on running an IP based network,\n\n294\n00:16:23.717 --> 00:16:27.480\nit's gonna use one of these\nthree protocols to communicate.\n\n295\n00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:34.230\nAnd so, we need to have a understanding\nof, exactly what each protocol uses.\n\n296\n00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:38.310\nAnd so for the exam, they want you to be\nfamiliar with some of the more common\n\n297\n00:16:38.310 --> 00:16:43.930\nprotocols, and what TCP and\nUDP port numbers are associated with them.\n\n298\n00:16:43.930 --> 00:16:47.860\nSo you need to know them by name,\nyou need to know their port number, and\n\n299\n00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:52.485\nyou need to know whether they use TCP,\nUDP, or both, all right?\n\n300\n00:16:52.485 --> 00:16:54.805\nSo, Ronnie made this nice little chart.\n\n301\n00:16:54.805 --> 00:16:56.665\nYeah and I love these text-based charts-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n302\n00:16:56.665 --> 00:16:58.755\n>> For whatever reason, I just do.\n\n303\n00:16:58.755 --> 00:17:01.107\nAnd I think it just makes me\nreminisce of the old days.\n\n304\n00:17:01.107 --> 00:17:03.560\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But basically,\n\n305\n00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:07.140\nit's just listing out all the different\nprotocols we should be familiar with.\n\n306\n00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:09.130\nAnd you'll see something like FTP.\n\n307\n00:17:09.130 --> 00:17:11.960\nFTP is a tricky one because it\nuses 2 ports 20 and 21, right?\n\n308\n00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:16.680\nOne to setup the session and\nconnection that's 21 and\n\n309\n00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:19.050\nthen one that transmit the data,\nthat's 20.\n\n310\n00:17:19.050 --> 00:17:22.930\nOther protocols like SSH just\nuse one port, it uses port 22.\n\n311\n00:17:22.930 --> 00:17:27.330\nBut it can use TCP and UDP if it wants.\n\n312\n00:17:27.330 --> 00:17:31.420\nA lot of times it just operates in\nstraight TCP mode, but it can do both.\n\n313\n00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:34.760\nTELNET same way,\nit uses port 23 TCP and UDP.\n\n314\n00:17:35.890 --> 00:17:39.380\nSMTP, Simple Message, shoot.\n\n315\n00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:40.530\nSimple Mail Transport Protocol.\n\n316\n00:17:40.530 --> 00:17:42.215\nThere we go, I was right the first time.\n\n317\n00:17:42.215 --> 00:17:45.220\n>> [LAUGH] That one runs on port 25,\nand it's TCP only.\n\n318\n00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:48.790\nWhen we send an e-mail, we need to know\nit's gonna get to where it's going, so\n\n319\n00:17:48.790 --> 00:17:49.790\nit uses TCP.\n\n320\n00:17:51.230 --> 00:17:54.650\nDNS port 53, it usually uses UDP, but\n\n321\n00:17:54.650 --> 00:18:00.090\nit can use TCP also, HTTP and\nHTTPS is in here somewhere.\n\n322\n00:18:00.090 --> 00:18:00.950\n>> Down at 443.\n\n323\n00:18:00.950 --> 00:18:01.590\n>> There we go.\n\n324\n00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:03.880\nJust the secure version of HTTP.\n\n325\n00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:07.190\nBoth of those use TCP and\nthey communicate.\n\n326\n00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:12.043\nSome of the e-mail protocols, POP three\nand IMAP, well POP three, IMAP and\n\n327\n00:18:12.043 --> 00:18:15.415\nSMTP, all three of them are not secure,\nright.\n\n328\n00:18:15.415 --> 00:18:20.235\nSo if you look at POP three on 110,\nIMAP on 143, they all use TCP so\n\n329\n00:18:20.235 --> 00:18:22.620\nthey're reliable, but they're not secure.\n\n330\n00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:24.520\nSo, they all have secure versions also.\n\n331\n00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:30.120\nSo you'll see down here, SMTP with SSL,\nsometimes called SMTPS, IMAPS\n\n332\n00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:36.220\nwhich is just IMAP with SSL and\nPOP3S which is well, POP3 with SSL.\n\n333\n00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:40.615\nYou'll also see it sometimes called as\nPOP3 with TLS, transport layer security.\n\n334\n00:18:40.615 --> 00:18:44.500\nTLS is just anytime you apply SSL\nto something other than HTTP.\n\n335\n00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:47.220\nThey call it TLS.\n\n336\n00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:50.295\nBut you'll see different port numbers for\nthem, 465,\n\n337\n00:18:50.295 --> 00:18:54.870\n993, 995, those are different port\nnumbers for when we're doing it securely.\n\n338\n00:18:54.870 --> 00:18:56.080\nAll right.\n\n339\n00:18:56.080 --> 00:19:00.010\nSo, hopefully none of\nthese are new to you.\n\n340\n00:19:00.010 --> 00:19:03.860\nMost of these are protocols that\nyou've been working with before, but\n\n341\n00:19:03.860 --> 00:19:05.740\nyou probably wanna memorize this chart.\n\n342\n00:19:05.740 --> 00:19:09.730\nYou're expected to have that familiarity\nwith these protocols prior to the exam.\n\n343\n00:19:12.010 --> 00:19:12.790\nAll right.\n\n344\n00:19:12.790 --> 00:19:15.980\nAnother thing that's gonna\nturn up on the exam is IPv6.\n\n345\n00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:20.700\nIPv6, is what's replacing IPv4.\n\n346\n00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:25.430\nIPv4, is what we run right now, okay?\n\n347\n00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:29.440\nSo, IPv4 has certain characteristics.\n\n348\n00:19:30.580 --> 00:19:35.790\nIt's main characteristic is\nthat it uses a 32 bit address.\n\n349\n00:19:35.790 --> 00:19:41.450\nSo if we convert the IP address into\nbinary, it's 32 ones and zeros.\n\n350\n00:19:41.450 --> 00:19:45.740\nAnd that means that if we look at\nthe maximum amount of numbers.\n\n351\n00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:47.420\nI don't know if you have this\none memorized, do you, Ronnie?\n\n352\n00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:49.350\nLike 4.3 billion or something?\n\n353\n00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:51.265\nYou know it, what is it?\n\n354\n00:19:51.265 --> 00:19:55.880\n>> No, it is, it's 4.295\n>> Let's see if we can find the actual,\n\n355\n00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:58.610\nI'm going to do something stupid and\ngo to Wikipedia.\n\n356\n00:19:58.610 --> 00:20:01.590\nBut, let's see if we can find out\nwhat that address actually is.\n\n357\n00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:03.030\nIt's a little over four billion.\n\n358\n00:20:03.030 --> 00:20:06.920\nIs what it is and, I wonder if the IANA\nis going to have it posted on here.\n\n359\n00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:07.950\nProbably not.\n\n360\n00:20:07.950 --> 00:20:12.624\nNah but you know who will, Wikipedia.\n\n361\n00:20:12.624 --> 00:20:17.180\n[LAUGH] Let's go in here and\nwe'll see what their address base is.\n\n362\n00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:21.780\nSo let's see, it says, no they say\n\n363\n00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:24.770\napproximately 4.3 billion,\ncan't give us a specific number.\n\n364\n00:20:24.770 --> 00:20:26.830\nWell, I already knew that.\n\n365\n00:20:26.830 --> 00:20:34.180\nAnyhow, we'll put it in here anyway that\nit is roughly 4.3 billion addresses, okay.\n\n366\n00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:37.460\nNow, when IPv4 was created\nback in the 70s and\n\n367\n00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:40.380\nthe 80s,\n4.3 billion that was a big number.\n\n368\n00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:43.812\nThere were only 4.3 billion\npeople on Earth that time and so\n\n369\n00:20:43.812 --> 00:20:46.840\nthey said hey,\nbased on that one per person.\n\n370\n00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:50.790\nWell, the problem is now there's\nover 6 billion people on the planet.\n\n371\n00:20:50.790 --> 00:20:52.070\nAnd most people,\n\n372\n00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:55.880\npeople like this guy right here consume\nmore than one IP address, right?\n\n373\n00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:57.100\nI've got an IP address at home,\n\n374\n00:20:57.100 --> 00:21:00.530\nan IP address at work, an IP address\non my cellphone, on my tablet.\n\n375\n00:21:00.530 --> 00:21:04.364\nSo, you've got several IP addresses\nthat you're consuming and\n\n376\n00:21:04.364 --> 00:21:07.370\nso, we burn through those\naddresses pretty fast.\n\n377\n00:21:07.370 --> 00:21:11.039\nIPv6 is the replacement for IPv4 and\n\n378\n00:21:11.039 --> 00:21:16.370\nthe main characteristic of it-\n>> [INAUDIBLE]\n\n379\n00:21:16.370 --> 00:21:18.310\n>> The main upgrade they did there was\n\n380\n00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:21.120\nthat this uses a 128 bit address.\n\n381\n00:21:22.325 --> 00:21:23.630\n>> [LAUGHS]\n>> And\n\n382\n00:21:23.630 --> 00:21:28.100\n128 bit address,\nwhich creates a ton of addresses,\n\n383\n00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:32.320\nand you'll see they say here,\n3.4 times 10 to the 38.\n\n384\n00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:40.270\nIf we say 3.4 times 10 to the 38th power,\nthat many addresses.\n\n385\n00:21:40.270 --> 00:21:42.040\nNow, how many is that?\n\n386\n00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:44.310\nIt's hard to put, a name on it.\n\n387\n00:21:44.310 --> 00:21:48.290\nSo, what I like to do is describe\nit in terms of IPv4 spaces.\n\n388\n00:21:48.290 --> 00:21:48.890\nRight.\n\n389\n00:21:48.890 --> 00:21:53.920\nSo, there's 4.3 billion addresses\nin the IPv4 address space.\n\n390\n00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:56.776\nAnd on the planet Earth today,\nthere's over 6 billion people.\n\n391\n00:21:56.776 --> 00:22:00.889\nWell, with 3.4 times 10\nto the 38th addresses,\n\n392\n00:22:02.390 --> 00:22:07.780\nevery single person on Earth, so\nall six billion of us, could have\n\n393\n00:22:07.780 --> 00:22:12.640\n4.3 billion addresses each, and\nwe'd still have some left over.\n\n394\n00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:13.520\n>> Yeah.\n>> Okay.\n\n395\n00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:15.150\nThat's how big this address pool is.\n\n396\n00:22:15.150 --> 00:22:16.350\nIt is massive.\n\n397\n00:22:16.350 --> 00:22:18.100\nThey basically said, you know what,\n>> We're not\n\n398\n00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:19.620\ngonna make that mistake twice.\n\n399\n00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:21.710\nWe're going to fix this right.\n\n400\n00:22:21.710 --> 00:22:25.980\nAnd so, we're gonna do the improvements\nright here in this one so,\n\n401\n00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:27.300\nwe never have to do this again.\n\n402\n00:22:27.300 --> 00:22:30.435\nBecause it's a pain in the butt\nto switch and you can see that\n\n403\n00:22:30.435 --> 00:22:35.805\nIPv6 actually came out almost\n20 years ago, a long time ago.\n\n404\n00:22:35.805 --> 00:22:37.845\nAnd only now, today, in 2014,\n\n405\n00:22:37.845 --> 00:22:42.565\nare we starting to see people make\nserious traction in moving over to IPv6.\n\n406\n00:22:42.565 --> 00:22:46.605\nIt's been a very slow process, all right?\n\n407\n00:22:46.605 --> 00:22:50.045\nSo because of that slow process,\ncuz it took so long to adopt,\n\n408\n00:22:50.045 --> 00:22:54.850\nwhile they were waiting, they started\nadding more and more stuff to IPv6,\n\n409\n00:22:54.850 --> 00:22:58.130\nthey basically looked at IPv4 and they\nsaid, what's all the stuff we screwed up?\n\n410\n00:22:58.130 --> 00:22:59.410\nLet's fix that.\n\n411\n00:22:59.410 --> 00:23:03.610\nSo for example, they integrated IPSec, so\n\n412\n00:23:03.610 --> 00:23:07.610\nyou can do encryption as\na native function of IPv6,\n\n413\n00:23:07.610 --> 00:23:11.950\nit's not like IPv4 where you have\nto tack on the IP seg framework.\n\n414\n00:23:11.950 --> 00:23:14.310\nHere you can do it right in the protocol.\n\n415\n00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:15.780\nWhat are some of the other ones?\n\n416\n00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:18.150\nIP mobility, all right.\n\n417\n00:23:18.150 --> 00:23:20.150\nWhen you're at home you have one address.\n\n418\n00:23:20.150 --> 00:23:23.810\nAnd then you walk away from your house and\nyou jump on your cellular network.\n\n419\n00:23:23.810 --> 00:23:25.980\nAnd then you drive to Starbucks and\nyou jump on their network,\n\n420\n00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:28.420\nand then you drive to your office and\nyou jump on their network.\n\n421\n00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:33.220\nWith IP mobility, you can have one IP\naddress that follows you across each of\n\n422\n00:23:33.220 --> 00:23:37.760\nthose networks, and as your session, let's\nsay you're streaming a Netflix video,\n\n423\n00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:41.730\nas you jump to that new network,\nit'll use redirect so that Netflix says,\n\n424\n00:23:41.730 --> 00:23:44.900\nI need to send it over here now And\nyour video will continue streaming.\n\n425\n00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:49.330\nAnd you can jump from network to network\nto network while the video is streaming.\n\n426\n00:23:49.330 --> 00:23:49.875\nRight.\n\n427\n00:23:49.875 --> 00:23:51.620\nNow, I tell this to people and\n\n428\n00:23:51.620 --> 00:23:54.630\nsometimes I get this response like\nthat's amazing how do they even do that?\n\n429\n00:23:54.630 --> 00:23:58.192\nAnd then I say, well it's not new,\nyou do it everyday.\n\n430\n00:23:58.192 --> 00:24:01.442\nHave you ever made a cellphone call\nwhile your driving down the road,\n\n431\n00:24:01.442 --> 00:24:04.033\ndo you think your on the same\ncell tower the whole time?\n\n432\n00:24:04.033 --> 00:24:04.811\nNo way.\n\n433\n00:24:04.811 --> 00:24:08.815\nYou jump cell towers all the time,\nsometimes you jump entire carriers.\n\n434\n00:24:08.815 --> 00:24:12.743\nYou jump from AT&T to Verizon or\nOrange to EE or\n\n435\n00:24:12.743 --> 00:24:16.885\nwhatever it is,\nour multinational customers.\n\n436\n00:24:16.885 --> 00:24:19.414\nWe don't have a whole lot of\nselection here in the US, but\n\n437\n00:24:19.414 --> 00:24:21.484\nyou guys outside of US\nhave great selections.\n\n438\n00:24:21.484 --> 00:24:22.041\n>> Yeah.\n\n439\n00:24:22.041 --> 00:24:23.938\n>> So you jump towers all the time,\n\n440\n00:24:23.938 --> 00:24:27.045\nthey basically just built\nthat in to IP addressing.\n\n441\n00:24:27.045 --> 00:24:29.460\nYou can do with phone numbers,\nyou can do it with IP addresses too.\n\n442\n00:24:29.460 --> 00:24:30.861\n>> All right.\n\n443\n00:24:30.861 --> 00:24:33.287\n>> What are some of the other\nthings they cooked in Ronnie?\n\n444\n00:24:33.287 --> 00:24:34.541\nThere's other stuff.\n\n445\n00:24:34.541 --> 00:24:37.703\n[LAUGH] I know they made\nit coexist with IPv4,\n\n446\n00:24:37.703 --> 00:24:40.207\nso you can run both at the same time.\n\n447\n00:24:40.207 --> 00:24:42.564\nI don't really consider that a bell or\nwhistle.\n\n448\n00:24:42.564 --> 00:24:44.131\n>> Those are usually\nthe big ones right there.\n\n449\n00:24:44.131 --> 00:24:45.291\n>> Yeah, those are some of the main ones.\n\n450\n00:24:45.291 --> 00:24:49.650\nThey did build in some other neat\nthings that are kinda cool based,\n\n451\n00:24:49.650 --> 00:24:51.880\nextensible headers.\n\n452\n00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:53.520\nThat's a big one.\n\n453\n00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:57.862\nWhen IPv4 came out, this was in the 70s\nand 80s, they never really thought about\n\n454\n00:24:57.862 --> 00:25:00.059\nnetwork conjection, or-\n>> Congestion.\n\n455\n00:25:00.059 --> 00:25:02.175\n>> Network congestion, there we go.\n\n456\n00:25:02.175 --> 00:25:03.034\nConjection.\n\n457\n00:25:03.034 --> 00:25:05.573\nAnyhow, they never thought about\nnetwork congestion, things like that.\n\n458\n00:25:05.573 --> 00:25:08.172\nAnd so later on, when they decided, boy,\n\n459\n00:25:08.172 --> 00:25:11.216\nwouldn't it be nice if we\nhad quality of service?\n\n460\n00:25:11.216 --> 00:25:15.952\nIf we had the ability to segregate traffic\nbased on what type of traffic it was and\n\n461\n00:25:15.952 --> 00:25:18.229\nthen give some priority over others.\n\n462\n00:25:18.229 --> 00:25:20.308\nAnd so,\nwhat they did is they created that.\n\n463\n00:25:20.308 --> 00:25:22.715\nWe have quality of service under IPv4, but\n\n464\n00:25:22.715 --> 00:25:26.813\nit was all kinda hacked in there in a\ncouple of available bits that we have and\n\n465\n00:25:26.813 --> 00:25:29.956\na lot of mistakes were made and\nit's not an ideal system.\n\n466\n00:25:29.956 --> 00:25:31.915\nIf you've ever configured\nquality of service,\n\n467\n00:25:31.915 --> 00:25:34.553\nthere's a little bit of magic\ninvolved with quality of service.\n\n468\n00:25:34.553 --> 00:25:35.575\nIt's really bizarre.\n\n469\n00:25:35.575 --> 00:25:37.792\nIt is a hacky solution that's in place.\n\n470\n00:25:37.792 --> 00:25:40.695\nWith IPv6, they said,\nwe don't want that to happen ever again.\n\n471\n00:25:40.695 --> 00:25:42.820\nSo, they created extensible headers.\n\n472\n00:25:42.820 --> 00:25:44.787\nInstead of having one header fields,\n\n473\n00:25:44.787 --> 00:25:47.556\nthey created a header field\nthat contains pointers.\n\n474\n00:25:47.556 --> 00:25:48.338\nThat says,\n\n475\n00:25:48.338 --> 00:25:52.967\nI have x amount of other headers\nstuffed down here later on in the file.\n\n476\n00:25:52.967 --> 00:25:56.917\nAnd so now, you can have as many\nheader fields as you want and\n\n477\n00:25:56.917 --> 00:26:00.327\nthat allows us to have\nadditional functionality.\n\n478\n00:26:00.327 --> 00:26:03.562\nSo if somebody comes up with\nsome great new idea next year,\n\n479\n00:26:03.562 --> 00:26:08.123\nthey can immediately support it in IPv6\nwithout having to rewrite the protocol,\n\n480\n00:26:08.123 --> 00:26:10.521\nwhich is really what happened with IPv4.\n\n481\n00:26:10.521 --> 00:26:15.323\nSo extensible headers, that is a really\ncool thing that they added not for\n\n482\n00:26:15.323 --> 00:26:16.801\nthe average end user.\n\n483\n00:26:16.801 --> 00:26:18.503\nThe average end user doesn't care, but for\n\n484\n00:26:18.503 --> 00:26:20.260\na network admin that's\na pretty cool thing.\n\n485\n00:26:20.260 --> 00:26:21.434\n>> Yeah.\n\n486\n00:26:21.434 --> 00:26:26.705\n>> Now, I know we've only spent about\n30 minutes talking about that stuff.\n\n487\n00:26:26.705 --> 00:26:32.835\nAnd literally, I could do 40-hour\nshow on networking concepts.\n\n488\n00:26:32.835 --> 00:26:36.480\nIf you watched any of my Cisco or\nNetwork+ shows, Ronnie's show, same thing.\n\n489\n00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:37.920\nWe do go in great depth.\n\n490\n00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:41.306\nThe reason I'm doing it here as high-level\nis that you're already supposed to have\n\n491\n00:26:41.306 --> 00:26:43.129\nthis knowledge, you should already had it.\n\n492\n00:26:43.129 --> 00:26:47.019\nIf you don't, if anything I talked about\nright there was just brand new and\n\n493\n00:26:47.019 --> 00:26:51.304\nblew your mind, jump over to the Network+\nshow, we really do go into it in depth.\n\n494\n00:26:51.304 --> 00:26:53.938\nThe Cisco show too, but\nthe Network+ one is the one I'd recommend,\n\n495\n00:26:53.938 --> 00:26:55.356\nbecause we really cover it in depth.\n\n496\n00:26:55.356 --> 00:26:56.807\nDefinitely check that out.\n\n497\n00:26:56.807 --> 00:27:01.545\n>> So, what we're gonna do next is\nwe're gonna get out of this whole\n\n498\n00:27:01.545 --> 00:27:06.130\ngeneral thing and\nwe're gonna dive into networking on Linux.\n\n499\n00:27:06.130 --> 00:27:08.960\nSo we're gonna take a look at\nhow we configure networking,\n\n500\n00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:12.655\nhow we configure out network cards and so\non and get a chance to work with that.\n\n501\n00:27:12.655 --> 00:27:16.103\nI'll post these show notes with\nthe episode, so you can study them.\n\n502\n00:27:16.103 --> 00:27:20.194\nAgain, you wanna memorize this chart right\nhere definitely something you should have\n\n503\n00:27:20.194 --> 00:27:21.270\nstored right up here.\n\n504\n00:27:21.270 --> 00:27:23.801\nSo, keep that in mind.\n\n505\n00:27:23.801 --> 00:27:27.111\nOtherwise, that's a pretty good spot for\nus to stop and take a break, Ronnie.\n\n506\n00:27:27.111 --> 00:27:29.049\nLet's do that, we'll pause here.\n\n507\n00:27:29.049 --> 00:27:29.846\nWhen we get back,\n\n508\n00:27:29.846 --> 00:27:33.206\nwe'll gonna configure our Linux server\nto be able to talk to the networks.\n\n509\n00:27:33.206 --> 00:27:33.752\n>> Sounds great.\n\n510\n00:27:33.752 --> 00:27:35.725\n>> So stay tuned,\nwe'll be back after this.\n\n511\n00:27:35.725 --> 00:27:41.671\n[MUSIC]\n\n512\n00:27:43.412 --> 00:27:44.654\nWelcome back, everybody.\n\n513\n00:27:44.654 --> 00:27:49.605\nSo, now what we're gonna do is we're gonna\ntake a look at configuring the network\n\n514\n00:27:49.605 --> 00:27:50.552\non a Linux Box.\n\n515\n00:27:50.552 --> 00:27:53.741\nAnd in most Linux distros\nwhen you fire them up,\n\n516\n00:27:53.741 --> 00:27:57.669\nthe network cards are turned on,\nthey're running DHCP.\n\n517\n00:27:57.669 --> 00:28:01.274\nAnd so right out of the box,\nyou got network connectivity, but\n\n518\n00:28:01.274 --> 00:28:04.840\nI work a lot in the Red Hat world and\nin the CentOS world.\n\n519\n00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:07.728\nAnd in that one, if you go to forums and\nstuff like that,\n\n520\n00:28:07.728 --> 00:28:10.922\nyou'll find people saying, hey,\nI did a minimal install and\n\n521\n00:28:10.922 --> 00:28:13.946\nnow my server comes up and\nit can't get out of the network.\n\n522\n00:28:13.946 --> 00:28:18.561\nAnd so it's a real common thing that some\nservers don't automatically configure your\n\n523\n00:28:18.561 --> 00:28:22.165\nnetwork adapter and they do that,\nbecause they wanna make sure that\n\n524\n00:28:22.165 --> 00:28:25.025\nyou are aware that you're\nconnected to the network.\n\n525\n00:28:25.025 --> 00:28:29.034\nIf you just bring up this OS and don't\nconfigure the network and it is connect,\n\n526\n00:28:29.034 --> 00:28:31.968\nyou might not have properly\ntaken the steps to secure it.\n\n527\n00:28:31.968 --> 00:28:33.604\nSo, that's what we're\ngonna take a look at here.\n\n528\n00:28:33.604 --> 00:28:38.416\nI reverted the network configuration on\nmy little server here to put it back to\n\n529\n00:28:38.416 --> 00:28:40.721\nthe way that it is stocked in CentOS.\n\n530\n00:28:40.721 --> 00:28:43.460\nSo, I'm gonna get logged into this thing.\n\n531\n00:28:43.460 --> 00:28:51.670\nAnd basically, I have this stock install\nthat I did and if I try and ping google.\n\n532\n00:28:51.670 --> 00:28:53.455\nPing, if you've never used that command,\n\n533\n00:28:53.455 --> 00:28:55.350\nI guess that is one of\nthe ones we need to cover.\n\n534\n00:28:55.350 --> 00:28:56.976\nPing is a great utility.\n\n535\n00:28:56.976 --> 00:28:58.158\nIt uses ICMP,\n\n536\n00:28:58.158 --> 00:29:03.674\nthe Internet Control Management Protocol\nto send a echo request.\n\n537\n00:29:03.674 --> 00:29:08.375\nA message to another host and it says,\nhey, if you're there and you get this,\n\n538\n00:29:08.375 --> 00:29:11.812\ncan you send me an echo reply\nto let me know you're there?\n\n539\n00:29:11.812 --> 00:29:13.647\nSo I'm gonna try that with Google.\n\n540\n00:29:13.647 --> 00:29:17.328\nAnd when I run it,\nI just get unknown host.\n\n541\n00:29:17.328 --> 00:29:19.533\nSo, it didn't find it.\n\n542\n00:29:19.533 --> 00:29:20.718\nNow it says, unknown host.\n\n543\n00:29:20.718 --> 00:29:24.022\nThat means that I might not have\nbeen able to look up the IP address,\n\n544\n00:29:24.022 --> 00:29:25.143\ncuz I did do it by name.\n\n545\n00:29:25.143 --> 00:29:29.648\nSo maybe I'll try an IP address instead,\nI'll try one of Google's servers.\n\n546\n00:29:29.648 --> 00:29:33.160\nSo 8.8.8.8 is of Google's DNS servers.\n\n547\n00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:36.730\nAnd if I ping that,\nnetwork is unreachable.\n\n548\n00:29:36.730 --> 00:29:37.801\nIt looks like I'm not getting out.\n\n549\n00:29:37.801 --> 00:29:42.225\nSo ping is a great utility just\nto test basic connectivity,\n\n550\n00:29:42.225 --> 00:29:44.533\ncuz you can ping by name and IP.\n\n551\n00:29:44.533 --> 00:29:46.844\nAnd so here I can see,\nI can't make it out.\n\n552\n00:29:46.844 --> 00:29:52.500\nAnother command that's really useful for\nus is ifconfig.\n\n553\n00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:56.454\nYour network cards in Linux\nare represented as interfaces and\n\n554\n00:29:56.454 --> 00:29:59.273\nifconfig is the interface configuration.\n\n555\n00:29:59.273 --> 00:30:01.513\nIt'll show you your network adapters and\n\n556\n00:30:01.513 --> 00:30:04.011\nit'll tell you what\ntheir configuration is.\n\n557\n00:30:04.011 --> 00:30:09.534\nAnd so when I look at mine, I can see I've\ngot one interface and it is called lo or\n\n558\n00:30:09.534 --> 00:30:13.914\nloopback and\nit's got an IP address of 127.0.0.1.\n\n559\n00:30:13.914 --> 00:30:17.097\nThat's actually a virtual adaptor,\nit's not a real one and\n\n560\n00:30:17.097 --> 00:30:19.880\nthe loopback is just available for\ntesting.\n\n561\n00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:21.360\nI couldn't ping Google a minute ago.\n\n562\n00:30:22.910 --> 00:30:27.140\nSo, is that a hardware problem or\na software problem?\n\n563\n00:30:27.140 --> 00:30:29.523\nI don't know.\nAnd so as we start to troubleshoot,\n\n564\n00:30:29.523 --> 00:30:31.797\nwe might wanna be able to just test ping.\n\n565\n00:30:31.797 --> 00:30:33.283\nMaybe ping itself is broken.\n\n566\n00:30:33.283 --> 00:30:38.836\nAnd so I can ping 127.0.0.1, which is\nthe equivalent of pinging yourself.\n\n567\n00:30:38.836 --> 00:30:43.488\nYou're pinging right back to yourself,\nexcept it's done entirely in software, so\n\n568\n00:30:43.488 --> 00:30:46.150\nit doesn't actually touch\nany hardware at all.\n\n569\n00:30:46.150 --> 00:30:48.462\nAnd so, I did a ping to myself.\n\n570\n00:30:48.462 --> 00:30:52.991\nSure enough, I'm able to ping myself and\nI'll hit Ctrl+C to stop it and\n\n571\n00:30:52.991 --> 00:30:53.814\nthere we go.\n\n572\n00:30:53.814 --> 00:30:56.982\nSo things look good there as\nfar as software is concerned.\n\n573\n00:30:56.982 --> 00:30:58.352\nWell, not quite.\n\n574\n00:30:58.352 --> 00:31:03.356\nWhen I ran that ifconfig,\nI saw that I had that loop back interface.\n\n575\n00:31:03.356 --> 00:31:05.609\nWhere is my real interface?\n\n576\n00:31:05.609 --> 00:31:08.185\nWhere is my real wired connection for\nthe system?\n\n577\n00:31:08.185 --> 00:31:09.544\nIt is not showing up.\n\n578\n00:31:09.544 --> 00:31:12.458\nSo, I don't even see my network card and\n\n579\n00:31:12.458 --> 00:31:17.196\nthat's probably a good reason why\nI'm not not able to boot here.\n\n580\n00:31:17.196 --> 00:31:22.955\nSo, the main problem here is just how\nthe network card is configured by default?\n\n581\n00:31:22.955 --> 00:31:24.228\nOn Red Hat and CentOS,\n\n582\n00:31:24.228 --> 00:31:28.655\nthe network cards are just turned off by\ndefault when you do a minimal install.\n\n583\n00:31:28.655 --> 00:31:30.642\nSo, I need to go and turn it on.\n\n584\n00:31:30.642 --> 00:31:33.369\nNow, different Linux distributions\nwork different ways.\n\n585\n00:31:33.369 --> 00:31:38.037\nBut for most of them,\nthey use a very simple script system.\n\n586\n00:31:38.037 --> 00:31:43.568\nWhen the system boots up and\nthe networking service starts,\n\n587\n00:31:43.568 --> 00:31:48.774\nit runs in series of scripts\nto configure your network and\n\n588\n00:31:48.774 --> 00:31:54.529\nyou can see them in\n/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/.\n\n589\n00:31:54.529 --> 00:31:57.965\nThat's the path right there,\n\n590\n00:31:57.965 --> 00:32:02.993\n/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/.\n\n591\n00:32:02.993 --> 00:32:07.156\nAnd if you go in there and just pull\nup a list, you'll see a bunch of stuff.\n\n592\n00:32:07.156 --> 00:32:12.010\nThese are all scripts that run either at\nboot time or when the service starts,\n\n593\n00:32:12.010 --> 00:32:13.959\nor when the server shuts down.\n\n594\n00:32:13.959 --> 00:32:15.517\nThese run at different points.\n\n595\n00:32:15.517 --> 00:32:21.356\nAnd so if you'll look, you'll see some\nin here like Interface down IPv6,\n\n596\n00:32:21.356 --> 00:32:27.620\nso when an IPv6 goes down this is called\nand what's in it will be executed.\n\n597\n00:32:27.620 --> 00:32:31.860\nAnd then we'll see other things like when\nppp if we're using point to point protocol\n\n598\n00:32:31.860 --> 00:32:34.620\nor whatever you'll see\nvarious ones that happen.\n\n599\n00:32:34.620 --> 00:32:38.825\nBut the ones we normally care about\nare these first two right here.\n\n600\n00:32:38.825 --> 00:32:42.515\nIfcfg-lo, that's my loop back adapter, and\n\n601\n00:32:42.515 --> 00:32:46.650\nifcfg-eth0 that's my\nfirst ethernet adapter.\n\n602\n00:32:46.650 --> 00:32:50.560\nYou might have more than one network card,\nand if you do you'll have more than one of\n\n603\n00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:54.030\nthose files in there,\none representing each card, right.\n\n604\n00:32:54.030 --> 00:32:58.660\nThat file right there is what\ncontains the settings for my adapter.\n\n605\n00:32:58.660 --> 00:33:02.069\nAnd if my adapter is turned off it's gonna\nbe this file that's causing that problem.\n\n606\n00:33:02.069 --> 00:33:02.963\nSo I'm gonna edit that file.\n\n607\n00:33:06.516 --> 00:33:09.090\nJust take a look at what's\nin there all right.\n\n608\n00:33:09.090 --> 00:33:11.800\nAnd I can see device equals eta zero.\n\n609\n00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:13.550\nIt gives me the MAC address next.\n\n610\n00:33:13.550 --> 00:33:15.900\nAnd that's important because if you\nhave more than one adapter how do you\n\n611\n00:33:15.900 --> 00:33:16.750\ntell them apart?\n\n612\n00:33:16.750 --> 00:33:18.960\nWell the MAC address, so we can see it.\n\n613\n00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:22.900\nIt is an ethernet adapter\nversus like a wireless adapter.\n\n614\n00:33:22.900 --> 00:33:28.230\nI can see the system is assigned a UUID,\nright a Universally Unique Identifier and\n\n615\n00:33:28.230 --> 00:33:31.590\nthat's just, so we can tell this\none apart from other adapters.\n\n616\n00:33:31.590 --> 00:33:34.670\nI've got ONBOOT equals no.\n\n617\n00:33:34.670 --> 00:33:35.780\nThere's my problem.\n\n618\n00:33:35.780 --> 00:33:39.620\nWhen the system boots up, how does it\nknow to turn the network adaptor on?\n\n619\n00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:41.610\nIt looks right here.\n\n620\n00:33:41.610 --> 00:33:42.840\nAnd on this one it says no.\n\n621\n00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:45.870\nAnd that is the default when you\ndo a minimal install with red hat.\n\n622\n00:33:45.870 --> 00:33:47.530\nAnd so I'm just gonna change that.\n\n623\n00:33:47.530 --> 00:33:48.650\nYes.\n\n624\n00:33:48.650 --> 00:33:52.420\nSo now when the system boots up,\nit will enable this network adapter.\n\n625\n00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:58.510\nThe other lines that are in here, MM\ncontrolled, this is a red hat only thing.\n\n626\n00:33:58.510 --> 00:33:59.270\nIn the red hat world,\n\n627\n00:33:59.270 --> 00:34:03.110\nwe have a little graphical program called\nthe network manager, and if you're running\n\n628\n00:34:03.110 --> 00:34:07.000\nthe GUI, it lets you configure your\nnetwork adapters and do all your stuff.\n\n629\n00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:12.270\nWell I'm not running the GUI,\nI'm on a text only install, so I don't\n\n630\n00:34:12.270 --> 00:34:17.150\neven have the network manager installed,\nso I'm just gonna change that to no.\n\n631\n00:34:17.150 --> 00:34:20.050\nIf we leave it as yes,\nthere's some scripts that won't\n\n632\n00:34:20.050 --> 00:34:23.060\nfire because it expects\nthe network manager to be there.\n\n633\n00:34:23.060 --> 00:34:23.920\nIf you have the GUI,\n\n634\n00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:27.730\nleave that to yes, if you don't\nhave the GUI, just change it to no.\n\n635\n00:34:29.150 --> 00:34:34.570\nOkay, like I said that's a red hat and\ncentralized and then boot protocol,\n\n636\n00:34:34.570 --> 00:34:39.050\nwhen we boot up, where do we get our\naddress from, and right now mine is set\n\n637\n00:34:39.050 --> 00:34:43.940\nto get it from DHCP from a dynamic host\nconfiguration protocol server, all right.\n\n638\n00:34:43.940 --> 00:34:46.200\nSo I'm gonna ask the network, I'm gonna\nreach out to the network and say,\n\n639\n00:34:46.200 --> 00:34:48.160\nhey can anybody out there\ngive me an address?\n\n640\n00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:49.280\nI need an IP address.\n\n641\n00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:53.010\nAnd while you're at it, I could really use\na default gateway and some DNS servers and\n\n642\n00:34:53.010 --> 00:34:57.150\nall that other stuff too and so it's gonna\nget all that from the network, right.\n\n643\n00:34:57.150 --> 00:34:59.010\nI'm gonna leave it that way.\n\n644\n00:34:59.010 --> 00:35:02.000\nOn a workstation,\nyeah you're gonna use DHCP.\n\n645\n00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:05.490\nOn a server you probably\nwant to use a static IP,\n\n646\n00:35:05.490 --> 00:35:07.590\nso that it's always the same address.\n\n647\n00:35:07.590 --> 00:35:09.180\nSo we might need to change this.\n\n648\n00:35:09.180 --> 00:35:10.489\nI'll show you how to do\nthat in just a moment.\n\n649\n00:35:12.602 --> 00:35:15.930\nAll right, so now I changed that\nfile I'm in business, right.\n\n650\n00:35:15.930 --> 00:35:17.260\nWell not quite.\n\n651\n00:35:17.260 --> 00:35:18.790\nIt doesn't know to rerun it.\n\n652\n00:35:18.790 --> 00:35:20.060\nSo I've got two choices.\n\n653\n00:35:21.260 --> 00:35:23.750\nOne I can reboot but\ngosh, I hate to do that.\n\n654\n00:35:23.750 --> 00:35:25.680\nOr two I can just restart\nthe network service.\n\n655\n00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:26.380\nAnd that's what I'm gonna do.\n\n656\n00:35:26.380 --> 00:35:30.070\nI'm gonna say, service network restart.\n\n657\n00:35:32.410 --> 00:35:35.400\nThat's gonna restart the network\nservice and when it restarts,\n\n658\n00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:36.360\nI can see it right there.\n\n659\n00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:39.210\nI'm bringing up interface eta zero.\n\n660\n00:35:39.210 --> 00:35:43.650\nAnd now it says that it's up,\nso that should be turned on and\n\n661\n00:35:43.650 --> 00:35:48.210\nI can run ifconfig again and\nthis time I see a configuration for\n\n662\n00:35:48.210 --> 00:35:52.960\nf0 as well as the loop back and\nwhen I look at f0\n\n663\n00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:57.710\nI can see it got an IP address of\n10.1.230.52, it got a IPv6 address too,\n\n664\n00:35:57.710 --> 00:36:03.280\nI have that turned on apparently.\n\n665\n00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:07.135\nSo I can see that it's got that address,\nit more than likely got other settings\n\n666\n00:36:07.135 --> 00:36:11.265\ntoo, like a DNS server, we'll see where\nthose go later, they don't show up here.\n\n667\n00:36:11.265 --> 00:36:13.665\nBut I more than likely got\nthe other settings, and\n\n668\n00:36:13.665 --> 00:36:15.745\nI should be in business, right.\n\n669\n00:36:15.745 --> 00:36:18.861\nSo if I go back and\nI try that ping again, if I try and ping.\n\n670\n00:36:18.861 --> 00:36:22.056\n8.8.8.8.\n\n671\n00:36:22.056 --> 00:36:23.415\nNow I'm able to ping through.\n\n672\n00:36:23.415 --> 00:36:26.407\nI'm actually getting out to\nthe network and functioning.\n\n673\n00:36:26.407 --> 00:36:29.662\nAnd if I try to ping my name.\n\n674\n00:36:32.588 --> 00:36:35.910\nThere we go it resolves it and\nI actually get a name back.\n\n675\n00:36:35.910 --> 00:36:40.680\nI am able to ping and\ncommunicate out to Google that way.\n\n676\n00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:43.850\nOn a work station,\nusually that's it we're done.\n\n677\n00:36:43.850 --> 00:36:47.440\nWork stations we want DHCP, we just\nflip that option on and we're done.\n\n678\n00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:49.870\nBut on a server,\nwe probably want a static IP.\n\n679\n00:36:49.870 --> 00:36:53.480\nAnd so there's a lot more\ninformation that can provide.\n\n680\n00:36:53.480 --> 00:36:55.360\nAll right.\n\n681\n00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:57.990\nBasically what we do is go\nright back into that file.\n\n682\n00:36:57.990 --> 00:37:01.960\nSo I'm just gonna edit that\nifcfg-eth0 file again.\n\n683\n00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:05.450\nAnd I'm gonna go and change a few things.\n\n684\n00:37:05.450 --> 00:37:08.470\nThe first thing I'm gonna do is\nI'm gonna change that bootproto,\n\n685\n00:37:08.470 --> 00:37:12.332\nthe boot protocol from DHCP to static.\n\n686\n00:37:12.332 --> 00:37:14.660\nThis is a server.\n\n687\n00:37:14.660 --> 00:37:17.920\nI want the server to have\nthe same address all the time.\n\n688\n00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:19.300\nI don't want it to change.\n\n689\n00:37:19.300 --> 00:37:24.600\nSo I'm gonna statically set it, and\nfix it at a certain value, okay.\n\n690\n00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:29.432\nNow the value that I wanna use,\nI need to specify next as IPADDR,\n\n691\n00:37:29.432 --> 00:37:34.369\nor IP address, and then I can tell\nit the address I want it to have.\n\n692\n00:37:34.369 --> 00:37:38.060\nMaybe I want it to be 10.1.230.\n\n693\n00:37:38.060 --> 00:37:41.530\nWhat do you think's\nan available IP on our network?\n\n694\n00:37:41.530 --> 00:37:42.100\nHow about 219?\n\n695\n00:37:42.100 --> 00:37:45.180\nI'm just making up an IP here.\n\n696\n00:37:45.180 --> 00:37:48.095\nLet me ping something and\njust verify that it's actually available.\n\n697\n00:37:48.095 --> 00:37:51.410\n10.1.230.219, doesn't look\nlike there's anything there.\n\n698\n00:37:51.410 --> 00:37:54.320\nAll right, cool let me stop that.\n\n699\n00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:57.140\nOkay, so I'm gonna go ahead and\nassign that IP address.\n\n700\n00:37:57.140 --> 00:37:58.738\nOkay, now I can't stop here,\n\n701\n00:37:58.738 --> 00:38:01.759\nwhen you assign an IP there's\nmore that you have to apply.\n\n702\n00:38:01.759 --> 00:38:03.247\nSo i've got the IP address sure, and\n\n703\n00:38:03.247 --> 00:38:06.500\nnow every time this server boots\nup it's gonna be 10.1.230.219.\n\n704\n00:38:06.500 --> 00:38:07.910\nYou'll have that nice IP all the time.\n\n705\n00:38:07.910 --> 00:38:12.040\nWell it's not really nice,\nit's just an IP.\n\n706\n00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:15.610\nI also need to specify a netmask.\n\n707\n00:38:15.610 --> 00:38:18.610\nAnd we use a class C network here, so\n\n708\n00:38:18.610 --> 00:38:23.530\nI'll put in 255.255.255.0 even though\nit's a class A address, right even\n\n709\n00:38:23.530 --> 00:38:27.680\nthough it starts with ten, we throttle it\ndown to a class C on our internal network.\n\n710\n00:38:28.690 --> 00:38:31.860\nSo there's the netmask, I can stop there.\n\n711\n00:38:31.860 --> 00:38:34.310\nNow I've got an IP address and\nI've got a Subnet mask,\n\n712\n00:38:34.310 --> 00:38:37.770\nthat's all I need to be able to\ntalk to my local network, but\n\n713\n00:38:37.770 --> 00:38:40.420\nwe probably wanna talk to more\nthan just our local network.\n\n714\n00:38:40.420 --> 00:38:43.880\nSo a few other values we might\nwanna provide DNS servers.\n\n715\n00:38:43.880 --> 00:38:45.380\nAnd you might want to do more than one.\n\n716\n00:38:45.380 --> 00:38:47.543\nSo I'll put in Google's DNS servers.\n\n717\n00:38:51.525 --> 00:38:55.780\nAnd you probably want a default gateway\nto be able to get out to the internet.\n\n718\n00:38:55.780 --> 00:38:59.820\nNow there's two ways to\nput in a default gateway,\n\n719\n00:38:59.820 --> 00:39:03.290\nthere's the way I prefer and then there's\na way that I'm about to show you [LAUGH].\n\n720\n00:39:03.290 --> 00:39:05.570\n>> We can put the default\ngateway right here.\n\n721\n00:39:05.570 --> 00:39:09.050\nSo I can come here, I can say,\nGATEWAY=10.1.230.1, that's our router.\n\n722\n00:39:09.050 --> 00:39:12.660\nNo it's actually a lay of free switch but\nanyhow, so\n\n723\n00:39:12.660 --> 00:39:14.710\nthat the device for you to get out.\n\n724\n00:39:14.710 --> 00:39:18.310\nIf you put it here though\nthere's a slight problem.\n\n725\n00:39:18.310 --> 00:39:21.600\nIf you have more than one network adapter,\n\n726\n00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:24.470\nyou can have a gateway defined\non each network adapter.\n\n727\n00:39:24.470 --> 00:39:29.340\nSo how does the system know which\none to use, which one wins out?\n\n728\n00:39:29.340 --> 00:39:31.910\nWell it uses the first one it finds,\nright.\n\n729\n00:39:31.910 --> 00:39:34.350\nAnd so you might not wanna\nleave that up to chance.\n\n730\n00:39:34.350 --> 00:39:38.000\nSo if you want to ensure that\none default gateway is used,\n\n731\n00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:41.380\neven when you have multiple\nadapters [COUGH] excuse me,\n\n732\n00:39:41.380 --> 00:39:44.660\nthere's another file where we\ncan place this, all right.\n\n733\n00:39:44.660 --> 00:39:48.140\nI'm gonna go ahead and put it here,\njust to show you guys that it does work.\n\n734\n00:39:48.140 --> 00:39:51.110\nAnd if you have a single adapter,\nthen you might as well put it here,\n\n735\n00:39:51.110 --> 00:39:53.250\nnow your configuration's all in one place.\n\n736\n00:39:53.250 --> 00:39:56.790\nBut if you have more than one adapter,\nyou'll wanna put it in this other file.\n\n737\n00:39:56.790 --> 00:39:59.210\nAnd I just make a habit\nof using the other file,\n\n738\n00:39:59.210 --> 00:40:03.080\nbecause what happens if I add another\nadapter later on down the road, right.\n\n739\n00:40:03.080 --> 00:40:05.380\nYou might change your mind and add things.\n\n740\n00:40:05.380 --> 00:40:08.650\nEven my home computer has more\nthan one adapter in it, sadly.\n\n741\n00:40:08.650 --> 00:40:12.320\nSo I usually just stick\nthings in the other file.\n\n742\n00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:14.558\nBut I'll put it here just to\nshow that it does actually work.\n\n743\n00:40:14.558 --> 00:40:20.095\nAll right, so IP address and\nsubnet mask, that's all that's required.\n\n744\n00:40:20.095 --> 00:40:23.533\nIf you want to talk to other networks\nthough you'll need that gateway.\n\n745\n00:40:23.533 --> 00:40:27.796\nAnd then, if you wanna do name lookups\nyou'll need the DNS entries and\n\n746\n00:40:27.796 --> 00:40:30.970\nDNS entries can be put\nin another file also.\n\n747\n00:40:30.970 --> 00:40:33.870\nAnd, again, very beneficial if you\nhave more than one network adapter.\n\n748\n00:40:33.870 --> 00:40:36.650\nSo what I'm showing you\nright here on the screen,\n\n749\n00:40:36.650 --> 00:40:39.890\nthis is great if you have\na single network adapter.\n\n750\n00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:43.526\nBut if you have multiple you\nwanna move things off and\n\n751\n00:40:43.526 --> 00:40:45.108\nI'll show you that in a moment.\n\n752\n00:40:45.108 --> 00:40:46.359\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and save that.\n\n753\n00:40:47.480 --> 00:40:51.660\nAnd I'll do a service network restart.\n\n754\n00:40:52.850 --> 00:40:54.360\nSo that, that takes effect.\n\n755\n00:40:54.360 --> 00:40:55.410\nThere it goes, it's restarting.\n\n756\n00:40:55.410 --> 00:40:59.480\nNotice how it's double checking to\nmake sure the IP address is available,\n\n757\n00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:04.560\nsee how it says checking if it's already\nin use, and then it's okay, so it came up.\n\n758\n00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:09.894\nSo now if I do an ifconfig,\nI can see that I'm now 10.1.230.219,\n\n759\n00:41:09.894 --> 00:41:14.260\nit's a static IP, every time I boot up,\nI'll have that same one even if the DHCP\n\n760\n00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:17.720\nserver goes offline, I'm not even looking\ngood anymore, I'll still have that IP.\n\n761\n00:41:18.880 --> 00:41:23.317\nAnd I should be able to ping out to\n\n762\n00:41:23.317 --> 00:41:30.120\nGoogle, and\nI should be able to ping my name.\n\n763\n00:41:30.120 --> 00:41:33.550\nAll of those settings coming\nfrom my interface configuration.\n\n764\n00:41:36.490 --> 00:41:40.645\nSo configuring the settings\non the interface, it works.\n\n765\n00:41:40.645 --> 00:41:44.240\nOn a workstation environment,\nthat may be how you do it.\n\n766\n00:41:44.240 --> 00:41:47.410\nIn the server world though,\nmultiple network card is pretty common.\n\n767\n00:41:47.410 --> 00:41:50.610\nAnd so, in that scenario,\nwe're gonna move our DNS settings and\n\n768\n00:41:50.610 --> 00:41:52.800\nwe're gonna move our gateway\nsettings out of there.\n\n769\n00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:57.920\nAnd so, if I'd go back in to that file,\nI'm gonna do just that.\n\n770\n00:41:57.920 --> 00:42:02.200\nSo I'm gonna delete out my DNS and\nmy gateway.\n\n771\n00:42:02.200 --> 00:42:08.707\nAnd so now, all I've got in here is\nBOOTPROTO=static, IPADD=10.1.230.219,\n\n772\n00:42:08.707 --> 00:42:13.060\nand NETMASK=255.255.255.0, and that's it.\n\n773\n00:42:20.141 --> 00:42:20.931\nDid I just delete something?\n\n774\n00:42:20.931 --> 00:42:21.836\nNo.\n\n775\n00:42:21.836 --> 00:42:24.190\nI thought I accidentally\ndeleted a line there.\n\n776\n00:42:24.190 --> 00:42:24.900\nYou got to be careful.\n\n777\n00:42:26.260 --> 00:42:31.190\nSo now where do I put that stuff if\nI have more than one network card and\n\n778\n00:42:31.190 --> 00:42:34.550\nI wanna ensure that a single\nset of information is used?\n\n779\n00:42:34.550 --> 00:42:36.740\nWell, we start with a gateway.\n\n780\n00:42:36.740 --> 00:42:43.380\nFor the gateway, if I just move up\na little bit, into that sysconfig folder,\n\n781\n00:42:43.380 --> 00:42:48.830\ninside of sysconfig, this is where we\nwent into the network scripts folder.\n\n782\n00:42:48.830 --> 00:42:52.528\nThere's also a file in\nthere called network.\n\n783\n00:42:52.528 --> 00:42:57.088\nNetwork is a file that contains general\nnetwork settings that applies to all of\n\n784\n00:42:57.088 --> 00:42:58.420\nyour adapters.\n\n785\n00:42:58.420 --> 00:43:02.130\nSo I'm in /etc/synconfig and\n\n786\n00:43:02.130 --> 00:43:06.870\nI'm editing the file called ./network.\n\n787\n00:43:06.870 --> 00:43:08.621\nNow, there might not be much in here.\n\n788\n00:43:08.621 --> 00:43:10.760\nYou might see a host name.\n\n789\n00:43:10.760 --> 00:43:12.010\nThat should look familiar.\n\n790\n00:43:12.010 --> 00:43:15.540\nMy system is called\nlocalhost.localdomain right now,\n\n791\n00:43:15.540 --> 00:43:17.300\nwe'll talk about changing it in moment.\n\n792\n00:43:17.300 --> 00:43:19.070\nBut I'm not worried about that right now.\n\n793\n00:43:19.070 --> 00:43:25.787\nWhat I wanna do is I wanna\nadd gateway=10.1.230.1.\n\n794\n00:43:25.787 --> 00:43:30.582\nNow, if I have five network adapters, and\ntheir each in five different subnets,\n\n795\n00:43:30.582 --> 00:43:34.682\nmy system will know that the default\ngateway to get to other networks is\n\n796\n00:43:34.682 --> 00:43:37.560\ngonna be through this particular gateway.\n\n797\n00:43:37.560 --> 00:43:40.485\nIt's not gonna pick randomly\nacross the five cards,\n\n798\n00:43:40.485 --> 00:43:42.372\nit's gonna use this one gateway.\n\n799\n00:43:50.198 --> 00:43:55.030\nSo that was /etc/sysconfig/network.\n\n800\n00:43:55.030 --> 00:43:58.411\nThat file,\nI just put the gateway in there.\n\n801\n00:43:58.411 --> 00:44:04.640\nFor DNS, we have a resolve.conf file,\nresolve.config.\n\n802\n00:44:04.640 --> 00:44:08.830\nAnd the resolve file it is just in /etc.\n\n803\n00:44:08.830 --> 00:44:13.860\nSo if I get back into my etc\nright here and I pull up a list,\n\n804\n00:44:16.130 --> 00:44:22.160\nsomewhere in here, we'll see resolv.conf,\nI'm just gonna go and edit it.\n\n805\n00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:27.720\nSo it's /etc/resolv.conf.\n\n806\n00:44:27.720 --> 00:44:34.080\nThis is where our resolvers, our name\nresolution, our DNS resolvers, stay,\n\n807\n00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:39.210\nand when you do DHCP it\nlearns the DNS servers and\n\n808\n00:44:39.210 --> 00:44:42.150\nit sticks them in here, so\nit actually put them in here for DHCP.\n\n809\n00:44:42.150 --> 00:44:46.360\nBut that's what I was gonna type anyway,\nnameserver followed by an IP, and\n\n810\n00:44:46.360 --> 00:44:49.910\nyou can have more than 1, you can\nactually have 20 of them if you want.\n\n811\n00:44:49.910 --> 00:44:53.248\nIt's only gonna use the first one,\nif the first one is not accessible,\n\n812\n00:44:53.248 --> 00:44:54.928\nthen we will move to the second one.\n\n813\n00:44:54.928 --> 00:44:59.970\nSo if you have 20 of them, 19 would have\nto fail before that 20th one gets used.\n\n814\n00:44:59.970 --> 00:45:01.609\nSo most people only put two in here.\n\n815\n00:45:01.609 --> 00:45:04.510\nBut you can put a handful.\n\n816\n00:45:04.510 --> 00:45:05.560\nThere's no reason not to.\n\n817\n00:45:06.760 --> 00:45:08.633\nSo that's the resolve.con filing, and\n\n818\n00:45:08.633 --> 00:45:11.160\nnotice what it's saying right\nhere in that first line.\n\n819\n00:45:11.160 --> 00:45:15.140\nGenerated by /bin/dhclient/script.\n\n820\n00:45:15.140 --> 00:45:17.630\nThat's letting me know that\nDHCP populated this for\n\n821\n00:45:17.630 --> 00:45:19.680\nme back in when I was in the DHCP system.\n\n822\n00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:22.600\nBut if I don't want that I can just\ndelete that line out of there, and\n\n823\n00:45:22.600 --> 00:45:25.300\nthen I can change these\nvalues to whatever we want.\n\n824\n00:45:25.300 --> 00:45:28.840\nYou can punch in multiple name servers,\npunch in whatever you want and\n\n825\n00:45:28.840 --> 00:45:30.620\nit can go there.\n\n826\n00:45:30.620 --> 00:45:32.010\nThe cool part here is,\n\n827\n00:45:32.010 --> 00:45:34.860\nI don't have to define DNS settings\non any on my network cards now.\n\n828\n00:45:34.860 --> 00:45:37.180\nAll my network cards will\njust use this setting.\n\n829\n00:45:37.180 --> 00:45:38.632\nIt's a little bit universal.\n\n830\n00:45:43.784 --> 00:45:45.595\nSo let's recap that.\n\n831\n00:45:45.595 --> 00:45:49.690\nIn /etc, /sysconfig, /network-scripts,\n\n832\n00:45:49.690 --> 00:45:56.219\nthat's where we had the configuration\nfile for each of our network adapters and\n\n833\n00:45:56.219 --> 00:46:00.138\nthat's where I put IP address and\nsubnet mask.\n\n834\n00:46:00.138 --> 00:46:04.730\nThen in /etc/sysconfig,\n\n835\n00:46:04.730 --> 00:46:08.590\nwe had a file called network, and\nthat's where I put the default gateway.\n\n836\n00:46:08.590 --> 00:46:10.524\nOne default gateway for my whole system.\n\n837\n00:46:10.524 --> 00:46:14.370\nAnd then, /etc/resolve.conf,\n\n838\n00:46:14.370 --> 00:46:18.250\nthat's where we can put our DNS servers,\nour name servers, and\n\n839\n00:46:18.250 --> 00:46:22.410\nthat'll be one set of DNS service for\nall of our network adapters.\n\n840\n00:46:22.410 --> 00:46:25.130\nThat's the configuration\nthat works best for\n\n841\n00:46:25.130 --> 00:46:27.750\nservers, where you might have one or\nmore adapter.\n\n842\n00:46:27.750 --> 00:46:30.720\nFor a workstation, you can stick all\nof that config on one adapter and\n\n843\n00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:31.720\njust be done with it.\n\n844\n00:46:31.720 --> 00:46:33.780\nBut even on those\nsometimes it's a problem.\n\n845\n00:46:33.780 --> 00:46:37.170\nIf you have like a laptop with a physical\nconnection and a wireless connection,\n\n846\n00:46:37.170 --> 00:46:40.010\nyou do see that really commonly.\n\n847\n00:46:40.010 --> 00:46:43.090\nSo in those scenarios, you may still\nwanna follow the other method,\n\n848\n00:46:43.090 --> 00:46:44.460\nI'm just got in the habit of doing it.\n\n849\n00:46:44.460 --> 00:46:47.010\nThat's how I always do it,\nI use the three separate files.\n\n850\n00:46:48.030 --> 00:46:49.225\n>> Nice.\n\n851\n00:46:49.225 --> 00:46:52.662\n>> Now that's in place,\nlet me just restart my network service.\n\n852\n00:46:56.771 --> 00:46:59.390\nAnd, sorry I got a little\nahead of myself there.\n\n853\n00:46:59.390 --> 00:47:03.760\nSo now it got the IP address and\nthe subnet mask from the network card.\n\n854\n00:47:03.760 --> 00:47:08.675\nThe gateway from the network config\nfile and then the DNS servers from\n\n855\n00:47:08.675 --> 00:47:13.170\nresolv.conf and I can go through and I can\ntest everything out with my ping command.\n\n856\n00:47:15.070 --> 00:47:17.270\nI can ping my default gateway,\nso that's good.\n\n857\n00:47:18.500 --> 00:47:23.862\nI can ping through my default gateway,\nthat's good, that means I'm using it.\n\n858\n00:47:23.862 --> 00:47:27.480\nAnd then,\nlet me do a name I haven't pinged yet so\n\n859\n00:47:27.480 --> 00:47:31.000\nit's not cached, and\nI can do lookups by name.\n\n860\n00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:33.010\nApparently, CNN blocks pings.\n\n861\n00:47:33.010 --> 00:47:35.590\nSo [LAUGH] who is somebody\nthat doesn't block ping.\n\n862\n00:47:35.590 --> 00:47:37.190\nI think Microsoft does too.\n\n863\n00:47:37.190 --> 00:47:37.690\n>> Yep.\n\n864\n00:47:38.980 --> 00:47:43.842\n>> Microsoft had too many ICMP\ndenial of service attacks.\n\n865\n00:47:43.842 --> 00:47:45.880\nI guess I could do itpro.tv.\n\n866\n00:47:45.880 --> 00:47:46.960\nUs.\nWe don't block ping.\n\n867\n00:47:46.960 --> 00:47:47.680\nThere we go.\n\n868\n00:47:47.680 --> 00:47:48.426\nSo I can ping our server.\n\n869\n00:47:48.426 --> 00:47:50.553\nThere we go.\n\n870\n00:47:50.553 --> 00:47:56.460\nSo these are the basics of getting\nyour network turned on and enabled.\n\n871\n00:47:56.460 --> 00:47:57.430\nIf you have more than one adapter,\n\n872\n00:47:57.430 --> 00:47:59.820\nyou would just do this more than\none time to get that setup.\n\n873\n00:48:01.280 --> 00:48:04.770\nThere are some other files that\nare involved when it comes to doing these\n\n874\n00:48:04.770 --> 00:48:07.089\nconfigurations in things\nlike setting the host name.\n\n875\n00:48:08.120 --> 00:48:11.525\nNow, when I installed this machine\nit asked me what I wanted the host\n\n876\n00:48:11.525 --> 00:48:12.134\nname to be.\n\n877\n00:48:12.134 --> 00:48:13.411\nAnd I just went with the default.\n\n878\n00:48:13.411 --> 00:48:16.917\nThe default was localhost,\nnot a very creative name.\n\n879\n00:48:16.917 --> 00:48:19.566\nSo down the road you might\nchange your mind and\n\n880\n00:48:19.566 --> 00:48:22.850\ndecide that you need a better hostname for\nthat system.\n\n881\n00:48:22.850 --> 00:48:27.170\nAnd so we'll see where we can go in and\nkinda define that.\n\n882\n00:48:27.170 --> 00:48:31.300\nSome distributions handle\nhostnames differently than others.\n\n883\n00:48:31.300 --> 00:48:33.970\nAll of them have the hostname command.\n\n884\n00:48:33.970 --> 00:48:36.830\nAnd you can run that and\nit will tell you what your hostname is.\n\n885\n00:48:36.830 --> 00:48:41.220\nAnd it's made up of two pieces, the local\nhost part, that's the hostname, and\n\n886\n00:48:41.220 --> 00:48:45.570\nthen local domain, well that's the domain\nname attached to your host, all right?\n\n887\n00:48:45.570 --> 00:48:48.580\nSo we can go in and define those and\nif you do it during the install,\n\n888\n00:48:48.580 --> 00:48:50.730\nyou just never worry about it again,\nall right?\n\n889\n00:48:50.730 --> 00:48:55.020\nBut if you wanna change it afterwards,\nyou'll typically need to pull up\n\n890\n00:48:55.020 --> 00:48:59.240\nthe documentation for your distribution\nto find out where they pull it from.\n\n891\n00:48:59.240 --> 00:49:00.310\nIn the Red Hat world,\n\n892\n00:49:00.310 --> 00:49:03.190\nit actually comes from that network\nfile that we saw a moment ago.\n\n893\n00:49:03.190 --> 00:49:11.301\nSo if I do a vi/etc/sysconfig/network.\n\n894\n00:49:11.301 --> 00:49:14.860\nRight there, I've got host name,\nlocalhost.localdomain.\n\n895\n00:49:14.860 --> 00:49:16.900\nAnd I can just go in and change that.\n\n896\n00:49:16.900 --> 00:49:24.100\nSo I'm gonna call mine\ndp-linux.lab.itpro.tv.\n\n897\n00:49:24.100 --> 00:49:28.140\nOkay, that's gonna be my new host name.\n\n898\n00:49:28.140 --> 00:49:29.376\nSo I'm just gonna change\nthat one in there.\n\n899\n00:49:34.108 --> 00:49:38.000\nAnd that's gonna change it on the IP side.\n\n900\n00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:42.320\nBut for other protocols there's actually\none more place that I need to take a look.\n\n901\n00:49:42.320 --> 00:49:43.890\nSo I'm gonna save that.\n\n902\n00:49:43.890 --> 00:49:51.470\nSo that was in /etc/sysconfig/network, and\nthen the other place is in /etc/ hosts.\n\n903\n00:49:51.470 --> 00:49:53.350\nNow, I haven't talked about that file yet.\n\n904\n00:49:53.350 --> 00:49:56.950\nIt's a special file, /etc/hosts.\n\n905\n00:49:56.950 --> 00:50:01.170\nAnd what it is,\nis a file that overrides DNS.\n\n906\n00:50:01.170 --> 00:50:05.240\nIt allows you to override whatever's\nin DNS with values that you specify.\n\n907\n00:50:05.240 --> 00:50:10.350\nWhen you do a name look up, you actually\ndo a look up against this file first and\n\n908\n00:50:10.350 --> 00:50:14.000\nonly if the item is not in there do you\nthen turn around and go out to DNS.\n\n909\n00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:16.480\nThat's the order that a look up happens.\n\n910\n00:50:16.480 --> 00:50:20.850\nSo if I edit that file, I can see\nwhere things are being over ridden.\n\n911\n00:50:20.850 --> 00:50:25.540\nAnd notice the entries that I have in here\n127.0.0.1, that's the loop back address.\n\n912\n00:50:26.730 --> 00:50:32.720\nAnd ::1, that's the loopback for IPv6 and\nthen I can see the names attached to it,\n\n913\n00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:36.540\nlook at all these names over here,\nlocal host and so on.\n\n914\n00:50:36.540 --> 00:50:42.370\nWell, these are all the names that the\nsystem understands for my local machine.\n\n915\n00:50:42.370 --> 00:50:46.221\nI need to add a little bit more to it,\nI'm gonna add,\n\n916\n00:50:46.221 --> 00:50:51.220\nI forgot to go into insert mode,\nI'm gonna add dp-linux, that's one name.\n\n917\n00:50:51.220 --> 00:50:55.800\nI'm also gonna add dplinux-, or wait,\n\n918\n00:50:55.800 --> 00:51:02.010\nit was dp-linux.lab.itpro.tv, all right?\n\n919\n00:51:02.010 --> 00:51:04.170\nSo I'm adding that one in there too.\n\n920\n00:51:04.170 --> 00:51:09.818\nSo now there's all these names\nattached to 127.0.0.1, all right.\n\n921\n00:51:09.818 --> 00:51:13.330\nAnd I'll just do the same thing here for\nthis one.\n\n922\n00:51:13.330 --> 00:51:19.788\nNormally I use keyboard shortcuts but\ngood old vmware's getting in my way.\n\n923\n00:51:19.788 --> 00:51:21.860\nOne of these days I'll sit down and\nfix that.\n\n924\n00:51:21.860 --> 00:51:23.700\nSo I'm just gonna add\nthose additional names.\n\n925\n00:51:23.700 --> 00:51:26.360\nI don't technically have to do this step,\nbut\n\n926\n00:51:26.360 --> 00:51:31.300\nif I'm gonna be using these names with min\ncommands or whatever, it's a good idea\n\n927\n00:51:31.300 --> 00:51:35.700\nto have min here as a host, or\nto go and update my actual DNS zone.\n\n928\n00:51:35.700 --> 00:51:39.230\nIf I have lab.itpro.tv stored somewhere,\nI need to go and\n\n929\n00:51:39.230 --> 00:51:44.456\nupdate that to have this dp-linux entry.\n\n930\n00:51:44.456 --> 00:51:47.380\nAllright, and I'll go ahead and\n\n931\n00:51:47.380 --> 00:51:52.375\nrestart my network service again,\nso that it takes effect.\n\n932\n00:51:52.375 --> 00:51:57.010\nNow my hostname is gonna be different,\nnow my bash session has already started,\n\n933\n00:51:57.010 --> 00:52:00.800\nso see how it still says @localhost,\nthat won't take effect until I log out and\n\n934\n00:52:00.800 --> 00:52:01.990\nlog back on.\n\n935\n00:52:01.990 --> 00:52:05.910\nBut if I do a ping to dp-linux,\n\n936\n00:52:05.910 --> 00:52:08.720\nit resolves to the loopback,\nI'm able to ping it.\n\n937\n00:52:08.720 --> 00:52:14.490\nAnd if I do a ping to the full name, the\nfully qualified name, I can do that too,\n\n938\n00:52:14.490 --> 00:52:19.340\nand now I'm able to communicate\nusing these new host names.\n\n939\n00:52:19.340 --> 00:52:26.310\nAnd if I log out and\nlog back in It hasn't taken effect yet.\n\n940\n00:52:26.310 --> 00:52:28.720\nShoot, I might have to reboot actually for\nthat to take effect.\n\n941\n00:52:28.720 --> 00:52:30.310\nWell, we got some time, I'll test it.\n\n942\n00:52:30.310 --> 00:52:32.300\nI'm gonna go ahead and reboot the system.\n\n943\n00:52:32.300 --> 00:52:34.990\nI thought you just had to restart the\nnetwork service, but it might be cached\n\n944\n00:52:34.990 --> 00:52:38.590\nand so it's still showing that\nlocal host or it might be hard set.\n\n945\n00:52:38.590 --> 00:52:43.980\nI'll have to check that config file,\nbut we'll just start it up here.\n\n946\n00:52:43.980 --> 00:52:47.790\nSo anyhow, now I've got this new\nhost name on my system and I can go.\n\n947\n00:52:47.790 --> 00:52:50.780\nIt's not like you're stuck with\nthe original host name you picked during\n\n948\n00:52:50.780 --> 00:52:51.800\nthe install.\n\n949\n00:52:51.800 --> 00:52:55.378\nThese are all just little\nconfiguration things that we might do.\n\n950\n00:52:55.378 --> 00:53:00.880\nWe'll take a look at the hosts\nfile again a little bit later.\n\n951\n00:53:00.880 --> 00:53:02.290\nThere we go, see my login?\n\n952\n00:53:02.290 --> 00:53:07.230\nIt now says dp-linux login instead\nof saying localhost login.\n\n953\n00:53:07.230 --> 00:53:12.890\nAnd if I log back in,\nnow my prompt says root@dp-linux, okay.\n\n954\n00:53:12.890 --> 00:53:15.500\nSo I had to reboot for it to take effect,\nit was either cached or\n\n955\n00:53:15.500 --> 00:53:16.890\njust requires reboot.\n\n956\n00:53:16.890 --> 00:53:19.680\nSo now I've got a new hostname,\noff I go right?\n\n957\n00:53:19.680 --> 00:53:21.750\nSo I'm not stuck with just localhost.\n\n958\n00:53:21.750 --> 00:53:26.170\nI do encourage you guys to set accurate\nhostnames because if you start opening up\n\n959\n00:53:26.170 --> 00:53:29.968\na bunch of SSH sessions, or whatever, it's\neasy to confuse which window you're in.\n\n960\n00:53:29.968 --> 00:53:32.090\nAnd those hostnames really help\nyou to differentiate that, so\n\n961\n00:53:32.090 --> 00:53:33.098\ndefinitely a good practice.\n\n962\n00:53:34.638 --> 00:53:37.399\nAll right, well we've got a lot of other\ncommands that we need to take a look at,\n\n963\n00:53:37.399 --> 00:53:39.049\na lot of them dealing\nwith troubleshooting, so\n\n964\n00:53:39.049 --> 00:53:40.850\ndefinitely important stuff.\n\n965\n00:53:40.850 --> 00:53:43.200\nBut this is a pretty good spot to stop and\ntake a break.\n\n966\n00:53:43.200 --> 00:53:46.722\nSo we're gonna pause for\na breather here and when we get back,\n\n967\n00:53:46.722 --> 00:53:49.109\nmore network configuration after this.\n\n968\n00:53:49.109 --> 00:53:57.278\n[MUSIC]\n\n969\n00:53:57.278 --> 00:54:00.078\nAll right, so during the break I just\nskimmed over my notes to make sure\n\n970\n00:54:00.078 --> 00:54:03.800\nI didn't miss anything, and I did miss\none file that I wanted to talk about.\n\n971\n00:54:03.800 --> 00:54:08.370\nThere's an extra file inside of\n/etc that is kind of important.\n\n972\n00:54:08.370 --> 00:54:13.520\nIt's called called nsswitch, and it's\nburied in here somewhere, there we go.\n\n973\n00:54:13.520 --> 00:54:15.900\nnsswitch.conf all right?\n\n974\n00:54:15.900 --> 00:54:20.040\nAnd what that does to that file,\nI made a comment, and I said,\n\n975\n00:54:20.040 --> 00:54:25.430\nwhen we do a lookup, our lookup actually\ngoes against the host file first,\n\n976\n00:54:25.430 --> 00:54:28.690\nand then it goes to DNS, and\nhow did the system know to do that?\n\n977\n00:54:28.690 --> 00:54:32.088\nWell, it's the nsswitch\nfile that determines that.\n\n978\n00:54:32.088 --> 00:54:36.357\nAnd so, if I edit that,\n/etc/nsswitch.conf,\n\n979\n00:54:36.357 --> 00:54:41.050\nthat file,\nit's got a lot of stuff in here, right.\n\n980\n00:54:41.050 --> 00:54:42.822\nBut at the end of the day,\n\n981\n00:54:42.822 --> 00:54:47.228\nit boils down a couple of really\nsimple entries here, hosts.\n\n982\n00:54:47.228 --> 00:54:50.100\nThis is the main one that we care about,\nright here, hosts.\n\n983\n00:54:50.100 --> 00:54:55.030\nWhen looking up a host name,\nit checks files first and\n\n984\n00:54:55.030 --> 00:54:58.960\nthen DNS, and by files,\nwe mean it checks the host file.\n\n985\n00:54:58.960 --> 00:55:02.020\nIt looks there first and\nthen it goes to DNS.\n\n986\n00:55:02.020 --> 00:55:06.350\nWe can change that order if we want, if we\nwant to disable the host file, we could\n\n987\n00:55:06.350 --> 00:55:11.000\nremove files from here and just have DNS\nby itself, now let's go straight to DNS.\n\n988\n00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:14.250\nIt might be that we use more than\njust DNS for name lookups and\n\n989\n00:55:14.250 --> 00:55:16.360\nyou'll see everything\nthat supported up here.\n\n990\n00:55:16.360 --> 00:55:19.280\nYou might have nisplus,\nI used to use that a lot under Solaris.\n\n991\n00:55:20.460 --> 00:55:24.450\nDNS files you might have a database for\nstoring your systems.\n\n992\n00:55:24.450 --> 00:55:28.999\nYou might have the older\nnisplus compatibility.\n\n993\n00:55:28.999 --> 00:55:29.930\n>> Hesiod?\n\n994\n00:55:29.930 --> 00:55:34.220\nYeah, I'm not familiar with that one,\nso whatever that is or stop.\n\n995\n00:55:34.220 --> 00:55:35.500\nJust don't do anymore lookups.\n\n996\n00:55:35.500 --> 00:55:37.605\nIf you don't find it,\njust die out and cut off.\n\n997\n00:55:37.605 --> 00:55:41.370\nSo you've got a couple of different\noptions there and you can swap the order\n\n998\n00:55:41.370 --> 00:55:44.900\nof them to influence the order that\nlook ups happen, that's this nsswitch.\n\n999\n00:55:44.900 --> 00:55:45.850\nNow I'll tell you,\n\n1000\n00:55:45.850 --> 00:55:50.880\nmost people are perfectly happy with\nhost files checked first and then DNS.\n\n1001\n00:55:50.880 --> 00:55:52.730\nSo most of us never change this.\n\n1002\n00:55:52.730 --> 00:55:54.610\nBut you might want to manipulate it and so\n\n1003\n00:55:54.610 --> 00:55:57.910\nthey show it here doing,\nlooking at their db first.\n\n1004\n00:55:57.910 --> 00:56:02.120\nThen their files, then nisplus,\nthen regular nis then dns.\n\n1005\n00:56:02.120 --> 00:56:03.570\nDNS being last so\n\n1006\n00:56:03.570 --> 00:56:07.430\nyou just kind of sort it as to whatever\nmeets the needs of your organization.\n\n1007\n00:56:09.880 --> 00:56:11.591\nAll right, yeah forgot that file.\n\n1008\n00:56:11.591 --> 00:56:16.572\nAll right, so\nwhen things are working, that's it.\n\n1009\n00:56:16.572 --> 00:56:20.076\nEverything we just saw that's all we need,\nwe're done, we're working,\n\n1010\n00:56:20.076 --> 00:56:21.622\nthings are great, life is good.\n\n1011\n00:56:21.622 --> 00:56:24.307\nWhat about when things aren't working?\n\n1012\n00:56:24.307 --> 00:56:27.223\nWhen something's just not behaving right,\nwhen the network is slow,\n\n1013\n00:56:27.223 --> 00:56:29.130\nwhen you can't get to a host?\n\n1014\n00:56:29.130 --> 00:56:30.410\nWe need to be able to troubleshoot.\n\n1015\n00:56:31.430 --> 00:56:37.160\nAnd so, Linux is chock-a-block full of\nnetwork troubleshooting utilities and\n\n1016\n00:56:37.160 --> 00:56:38.790\ncommands that we can use.\n\n1017\n00:56:38.790 --> 00:56:40.710\nAnd so, I wanna run down\na laundry list of them and\n\n1018\n00:56:40.710 --> 00:56:43.660\nkinda show when we would use them and\nhow they work.\n\n1019\n00:56:43.660 --> 00:56:46.098\nMost of them are pretty straightforward.\n\n1020\n00:56:46.098 --> 00:56:47.698\nSome we've already seen.\n\n1021\n00:56:47.698 --> 00:56:52.320\nifconfig, when I'm on a new system and\nI'm not sure what's going on,\n\n1022\n00:56:52.320 --> 00:56:57.560\nifconfig is one of the first commands that\nI run, because it shows me what network\n\n1023\n00:56:57.560 --> 00:57:02.668\nadaptors are present, it shows me what\ntheir IP addresses are and if their UP.\n\n1024\n00:57:02.668 --> 00:57:05.440\nNotice that little statement right there,\nUP.\n\n1025\n00:57:05.440 --> 00:57:09.310\nIf it said down, that's a pretty good\nindicator the CAR's not gonna be working.\n\n1026\n00:57:09.310 --> 00:57:11.840\nAnd it might be down because\nit was manually turned off or\n\n1027\n00:57:11.840 --> 00:57:13.850\nit might be down because it's unplugged.\n\n1028\n00:57:13.850 --> 00:57:15.510\nIt might not have a link.\n\n1029\n00:57:15.510 --> 00:57:20.709\nNotice up here, scope, link, well,\nthat's actually for the address, isn't it?\n\n1030\n00:57:20.709 --> 00:57:22.450\nSo it just shows that it's UP.\n\n1031\n00:57:22.450 --> 00:57:25.020\nI can see that it's\nactually moving packets.\n\n1032\n00:57:25.020 --> 00:57:28.160\nI've got as received, 2,486 packets, and\n\n1033\n00:57:28.160 --> 00:57:32.730\nit's transmitted 11 packets, so I can\nsee that it is sending and receiving.\n\n1034\n00:57:32.730 --> 00:57:37.487\nIf those are both 0s that's another\nindicator that this network adapter might\n\n1035\n00:57:37.487 --> 00:57:38.768\nbe dead in the water.\n\n1036\n00:57:38.768 --> 00:57:44.245\nA few other things that we might want to\ntinker around with while we're in here,\n\n1037\n00:57:44.245 --> 00:57:46.860\nall the files that we talked about.\n\n1038\n00:57:46.860 --> 00:57:50.530\nWhen the network isn't working for me,\nI might go and double check those files,\n\n1039\n00:57:50.530 --> 00:57:55.420\nthe network script,\nthe network file itself,\n\n1040\n00:57:55.420 --> 00:57:58.420\nthe resolve.conf just to make sure\nthat my settings are correct.\n\n1041\n00:57:59.600 --> 00:58:01.040\nBut assuming that my settings are correct,\n\n1042\n00:58:01.040 --> 00:58:02.948\nthere are several other things\nwe can use to test with.\n\n1043\n00:58:02.948 --> 00:58:05.070\nPing is a great one.\n\n1044\n00:58:05.070 --> 00:58:08.418\nYou can ping a host and I always\nrecommend pinging from the inside out,\n\n1045\n00:58:08.418 --> 00:58:11.677\ncuz you don't know necessarily\nwhere your failure's going to be.\n\n1046\n00:58:11.677 --> 00:58:16.017\nSo you could ping yourself, 127.0.0.1.\n\n1047\n00:58:16.017 --> 00:58:19.860\nThat's pinging me by\nthe loop back address.\n\n1048\n00:58:19.860 --> 00:58:22.580\nNow, that one doesn't\nactually touch hardware.\n\n1049\n00:58:22.580 --> 00:58:24.368\nSo it's not a test of your hardware.\n\n1050\n00:58:24.368 --> 00:58:28.558\nIf you wanna test your hardware,\nyou'll need to ping to your actual IP.\n\n1051\n00:58:28.558 --> 00:58:30.310\nSo there's my actual IP.\n\n1052\n00:58:30.310 --> 00:58:33.470\nAnd now the ping is actually going and\nhitting my physical network card\n\n1053\n00:58:33.470 --> 00:58:36.770\nbefore coming back, so I get a little\nbit of a test of the hardware.\n\n1054\n00:58:39.980 --> 00:58:43.320\nLet's see some of the other things that we\ncan do then, we can ping out through our\n\n1055\n00:58:43.320 --> 00:58:46.700\ndefault gateway and\nmake sure that we can hit that.\n\n1056\n00:58:46.700 --> 00:58:49.120\nSo I'm moving away from my computer now.\n\n1057\n00:58:49.120 --> 00:58:53.770\nAnd only then do I really ping all\nthe way out to the Internet and\n\n1058\n00:58:53.770 --> 00:59:00.550\nif I do it all with IPs,\nI'm testing just IP connectivity, not DNS.\n\n1059\n00:59:00.550 --> 00:59:04.857\nIf I ping with the host name then I'm\ntesting DNS at the same time, I don't like\n\n1060\n00:59:04.857 --> 00:59:09.128\nto do more than one thing at once, cuzI\nwanna try and narrow down the problem.\n\n1061\n00:59:09.128 --> 00:59:12.129\nNow, this process of pinging\nfrom the inside out, well,\n\n1062\n00:59:12.129 --> 00:59:16.700\nit can be simplified with some other\nutilities we have, like traceroute.\n\n1063\n00:59:16.700 --> 00:59:21.590\nTraceroute will show every host\nin between you and a destination,\n\n1064\n00:59:21.590 --> 00:59:24.970\ncuz often times you have to pass through\nseveral routers to get somewhere.\n\n1065\n00:59:24.970 --> 00:59:33.084\nSo if I do a traceroute to Google's DNS\nservers, I'll stick with that, so\n\n1066\n00:59:33.084 --> 00:59:39.580\na traceroute to 8.8.8, it's going to show\nme the path I have to go to get there.\n\n1067\n00:59:39.580 --> 00:59:43.387\nAnd so, you'll see as I'm\nleaving the building here and\n\n1068\n00:59:43.387 --> 00:59:48.855\njumping over to our ISP, which is GRU, and\nthen we go from GRU over to still in GRU,\n\n1069\n00:59:48.855 --> 00:59:54.270\nthey send us down to Miami, so\nwe're actually going south down to Miami.\n\n1070\n00:59:54.270 --> 00:59:57.210\nAnd then from Miami, they're sending us up\nto some IPs that I don't know where they\n\n1071\n00:59:57.210 --> 00:59:59.790\nare, and then somehow magically,\nwe end up at Google.\n\n1072\n00:59:59.790 --> 01:00:02.473\nBut I can see each of\nthe hosts along the way, and\n\n1073\n01:00:02.473 --> 01:00:05.037\nI can see what their\nresponse times are like.\n\n1074\n01:00:05.037 --> 01:00:09.489\nAnd so, if my connection drops off at some\npoint and I don't get to the destination,\n\n1075\n01:00:09.489 --> 01:00:11.090\nI'll see these stars.\n\n1076\n01:00:11.090 --> 01:00:15.460\nThe stars indicate either that, the host\nis off and you're not getting there.\n\n1077\n01:00:15.460 --> 01:00:17.870\nOr that there's a firewall\nthat's blocking the response.\n\n1078\n01:00:17.870 --> 01:00:20.210\nAnd that's actually what's happening\nhere with Google stopping it.\n\n1079\n01:00:20.210 --> 01:00:24.290\nBut I do make it through to my\ndestination so I can disregard that.\n\n1080\n01:00:24.290 --> 01:00:27.850\nBut if I saw a series of stars and\nI never made it to the destination,\n\n1081\n01:00:27.850 --> 01:00:31.340\nthen that would indicate\na bigger problem or a firewall.\n\n1082\n01:00:31.340 --> 01:00:33.950\nAnd I think Microsoft\nis an example of that.\n\n1083\n01:00:33.950 --> 01:00:35.520\nLet's see if they do it.\n\n1084\n01:00:35.520 --> 01:00:39.150\nThey get there and then towards\nthe end it just drops off, and so\n\n1085\n01:00:39.150 --> 01:00:40.950\nit looks like you can't there,\nbut I know I can.\n\n1086\n01:00:40.950 --> 01:00:42.160\nI can go to Microsoft's website.\n\n1087\n01:00:42.160 --> 01:00:43.050\nThere we go.\n\n1088\n01:00:43.050 --> 01:00:45.767\nAnd what that is and\nwe know that there's hosts there, but\n\n1089\n01:00:45.767 --> 01:00:49.600\nthe hosts are not responding to our trace\nroute, and so it just dies off like that.\n\n1090\n01:00:51.890 --> 01:00:56.600\nSo if I wasn't able to get to Microsoft,\nthis is the point where I lose visibility.\n\n1091\n01:00:56.600 --> 01:01:01.016\nAnd so, that either means\nthat's where the problem is or\n\n1092\n01:01:01.016 --> 01:01:05.358\nit means that there's a firewall\nblocking my look ups.\n\n1093\n01:01:05.358 --> 01:01:09.489\nWhen traceroute runs,\nif I go back to traceroute to ITPro.TV,\n\n1094\n01:01:09.489 --> 01:01:14.152\nwhen traceroute runs, what it's showing\nyou here are the host names for\n\n1095\n01:01:14.152 --> 01:01:19.369\nthe various connections, and then you\nget a little summary of the performance.\n\n1096\n01:01:19.369 --> 01:01:23.660\nSo it shows 32 milliseconds here,\n32 milliseconds there.\n\n1097\n01:01:23.660 --> 01:01:24.910\nAre we blocking it?\n\n1098\n01:01:24.910 --> 01:01:28.350\nI guess we're blocking\ntraceroute on our server also.\n\n1099\n01:01:28.350 --> 01:01:29.320\nWe should open that up.\n\n1100\n01:01:29.320 --> 01:01:30.270\nWell, anyhow.\n\n1101\n01:01:30.270 --> 01:01:33.590\nIf I do it to Google,\nthey went all the way through.\n\n1102\n01:01:33.590 --> 01:01:37.070\nSo anyhow, we get a little summary\nof the performance along the way.\n\n1103\n01:01:37.070 --> 01:01:41.790\nThere is another command we can use\ncalled tracepath, and it's very similar.\n\n1104\n01:01:41.790 --> 01:01:45.113\nIf I do trace path to 8.8.8,\nit's showing me\n\n1105\n01:01:45.113 --> 01:01:49.869\nthe same thing with that summary of\nperformance over there on the side.\n\n1106\n01:01:49.869 --> 01:01:52.827\nAnd so, I can kinda get that summary and\n\n1107\n01:01:52.827 --> 01:01:56.963\nI can see a little bit of\nother information about them.\n\n1108\n01:01:56.963 --> 01:02:00.738\nI should really find some host that we can\ntraceroute to that's open the whole way.\n\n1109\n01:02:04.082 --> 01:02:06.800\nLet's see if we can just do like to gru,\nsince we're on their network anyway.\n\n1110\n01:02:08.410 --> 01:02:09.900\nNo, even they're blocking it.\n\n1111\n01:02:09.900 --> 01:02:14.299\nThere are some distributed denial\nservice attacks that abuse ICMP, and\n\n1112\n01:02:14.299 --> 01:02:17.543\nso more and\nmore providers out there are blocking ICMP\n\n1113\n01:02:17.543 --> 01:02:22.108\ncommunications because they wanna\nstop these denial of service attacks.\n\n1114\n01:02:22.108 --> 01:02:26.218\nAnd so, it looks like I'm having a hard\ntime of finding somebody who doesn't do it\n\n1115\n01:02:26.218 --> 01:02:27.540\nat some point or another.\n\n1116\n01:02:29.090 --> 01:02:30.720\nI know CNN did it.\n\n1117\n01:02:30.720 --> 01:02:31.930\nFox News, they can't.\n\n1118\n01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:34.760\nThere we go.\nLook at that.\n\n1119\n01:02:34.760 --> 01:02:36.043\nWe go all the way through.\n\n1120\n01:02:36.043 --> 01:02:40.090\n[LAUGH] So we can see, I reach right out\nto them and I can get to their system.\n\n1121\n01:02:40.090 --> 01:02:43.093\nThey're on [INAUDIBLE] and so\nthey do all sorts of communications there.\n\n1122\n01:02:43.093 --> 01:02:45.752\nSo now I can get that good vision and\n\n1123\n01:02:45.752 --> 01:02:49.988\nsee maybe where a problem\noccurs if there is a problem.\n\n1124\n01:02:49.988 --> 01:02:54.030\nSo that was, let's see,\nwe did traceroute and tracepath.\n\n1125\n01:02:54.030 --> 01:02:58.850\nThere's a few other ones that we can make\nuse of, especially like name lookups.\n\n1126\n01:02:58.850 --> 01:03:02.900\nSo if I'm having problems with DNS,\nI can go to my resolve.conf file and\n\n1127\n01:03:02.900 --> 01:03:05.180\nmake sure my DNS servers are set right.\n\n1128\n01:03:05.180 --> 01:03:09.180\nBut if I wanna do a lookup,\nthere's a few commands we can use.\n\n1129\n01:03:09.180 --> 01:03:13.730\nThe original Unix command for\ndoing domain lookups is dig, and so\n\n1130\n01:03:13.730 --> 01:03:16.640\nyou can say dig www.google.com and\n\n1131\n01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:22.230\nit will return the IP address\ninformation for google.\n\n1132\n01:03:22.230 --> 01:03:24.825\nThese are the DNS records for google.\n\n1133\n01:03:24.825 --> 01:03:29.070\nNow, you get some nice information\nhere about the query, the server,\n\n1134\n01:03:29.070 --> 01:03:33.908\nthe message size, all sorts of details and\ninformation about that name lookup.\n\n1135\n01:03:33.908 --> 01:03:37.080\nSo it's a very detailed command you\ndo get a lot of good information.\n\n1136\n01:03:38.200 --> 01:03:42.080\nYou can also use nslookup\nwhich is name server lookup.\n\n1137\n01:03:42.080 --> 01:03:45.080\nAnd I'll just do the same look up.\n\n1138\n01:03:45.080 --> 01:03:47.060\nIt's information is a little more compact.\n\n1139\n01:03:47.060 --> 01:03:50.900\nYou don't get a lot of the extra\ndetails you just get the names, and\n\n1140\n01:03:50.900 --> 01:03:51.920\nthe IP addresses.\n\n1141\n01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:55.141\nAnd so, I can see Google,\nthey've got more than one IP,\n\n1142\n01:03:55.141 --> 01:03:59.728\nthese are all load balancers that are then\nsending us across different systems.\n\n1143\n01:03:59.728 --> 01:04:01.910\nLet's see, there's one other, host.\n\n1144\n01:04:02.950 --> 01:04:08.111\nHost is another one that you can run, and\nyou'll see it's even more simplified.\n\n1145\n01:04:08.111 --> 01:04:11.832\nJust straight up giving me the name and\nthe IP, and\n\n1146\n01:04:11.832 --> 01:04:14.498\nin this case returning IPv6 also.\n\n1147\n01:04:14.498 --> 01:04:16.216\nAll right, which one's the right one?\n\n1148\n01:04:16.216 --> 01:04:19.850\nThey're all right, all three of them work,\nit's whatever you want.\n\n1149\n01:04:19.850 --> 01:04:25.130\nIf you're gonna be manipulating the data,\nthe host command gives us the cleanest\n\n1150\n01:04:25.130 --> 01:04:30.101\noutput because you can use the tr or\ntranslate command and you can grab certain\n\n1151\n01:04:30.101 --> 01:04:35.096\ncolumns out of this and do work with it,\nif that's what you're looking for.\n\n1152\n01:04:35.096 --> 01:04:36.939\nBut the other ones might\ngive you more information.\n\n1153\n01:04:36.939 --> 01:04:39.869\nSo dig, nslookup, and host,\n\n1154\n01:04:39.869 --> 01:04:44.730\nall three of those let us\ndo name to IP conversions.\n\n1155\n01:04:46.390 --> 01:04:48.280\nAll right, what else is on our list?\n\n1156\n01:04:49.820 --> 01:04:55.107\nOur clients, so we have various\nclients that are built into Linux,\n\n1157\n01:04:55.107 --> 01:05:00.877\na lot of them are installed by default,\nclients like TelNet, FTP, SSH.\n\n1158\n01:05:00.877 --> 01:05:03.832\nIf I want to connect to an FTP server,\nI can type FTP and\n\n1159\n01:05:03.832 --> 01:05:06.940\nthen the address of the server\nthat I want to connect to.\n\n1160\n01:05:07.960 --> 01:05:11.200\nApparently I don't have FTP\ninstalled by default on this system.\n\n1161\n01:05:11.200 --> 01:05:12.170\nSo I can install it.\n\n1162\n01:05:14.190 --> 01:05:15.800\nSo I'll just install it real quick.\n\n1163\n01:05:15.800 --> 01:05:20.400\nI'm doing yum ftp install, and so\nit's gonna get the FTP package.\n\n1164\n01:05:20.400 --> 01:05:24.590\nNow this is the FTP client and\nnot the FTP server.\n\n1165\n01:05:24.590 --> 01:05:27.740\nSo I'm just gonna reach out and get that.\n\n1166\n01:05:27.740 --> 01:05:32.302\nAnd I will FTP into a host on the network,\nthere we go, and\n\n1167\n01:05:32.302 --> 01:05:34.880\nI'll just log in as anonymous.\n\n1168\n01:05:38.223 --> 01:05:43.242\nAll right, and so here I am, I'm connected\ninto this other system and I can start to\n\n1169\n01:05:43.242 --> 01:05:48.264\ntransfer files and I'll make a directory\ncalled Don, change into the directory,\n\n1170\n01:05:48.264 --> 01:05:52.830\npull up a list, copy some files,\ndo whatever it is that I want to do.\n\n1171\n01:05:52.830 --> 01:05:54.480\nI'm now using file transfer protocol.\n\n1172\n01:05:56.780 --> 01:06:02.562\nSSH, I know you guys have seen me\nuse that during the show, so I might\n\n1173\n01:06:02.562 --> 01:06:08.518\nSSH into, I'll do a switch here so\nI'm gonna SSH into a switch.\n\n1174\n01:06:08.518 --> 01:06:13.370\nI do username@ and then the IP or\nhost name of the device I'm connecting to.\n\n1175\n01:06:13.370 --> 01:06:15.210\nNow SSH uses security keys, and\n\n1176\n01:06:15.210 --> 01:06:18.240\nI'm gonna talk about SSH a lot\nmore in the security episode.\n\n1177\n01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:20.701\nSo I'm just gonna accept that key here for\nnow.\n\n1178\n01:06:23.582 --> 01:06:24.824\nAnd then I'll login.\n\n1179\n01:06:24.824 --> 01:06:27.200\nAnd now I'm on that switch.\n\n1180\n01:06:27.200 --> 01:06:29.500\nAnd here it is, this is the Cisco\nswitch that I just remoted into.\n\n1181\n01:06:29.500 --> 01:06:32.080\nI can start to work with it and\ndo whatever I need.\n\n1182\n01:06:33.590 --> 01:06:34.680\nWe also have Telnet,\n\n1183\n01:06:34.680 --> 01:06:38.490\nnow Telnet often times isn't\nincluded because it's not secure.\n\n1184\n01:06:38.490 --> 01:06:42.010\nAnd so you may need to install\nit if you want to use it, so\n\n1185\n01:06:42.010 --> 01:06:44.670\nI'm gonna install that\nwith yum install telnet.\n\n1186\n01:06:46.060 --> 01:06:49.120\nAnd now I can Telnet to\nhosts that are out there.\n\n1187\n01:06:50.570 --> 01:06:53.174\nBoy, I can't think of anybody\nto Telnet into offhand.\n\n1188\n01:06:53.174 --> 01:06:57.202\n[LAUGH] I'm pretty sure we have it\nblocked on our systems, don't we?\n\n1189\n01:06:57.202 --> 01:07:00.220\n>> I would think so.\n>> Yeah, so Telnet is really like SSH but\n\n1190\n01:07:00.220 --> 01:07:01.720\nit's not secure.\n\n1191\n01:07:01.720 --> 01:07:03.980\nEverything's sent in plain text, so\n\n1192\n01:07:03.980 --> 01:07:06.480\nwe don't normally like to\nuse it if we can avoid it.\n\n1193\n01:07:06.480 --> 01:07:09.630\nIn the security show I'll actually\nshow you a way around that\n\n1194\n01:07:09.630 --> 01:07:12.395\nwhere we can secure Telnet, but\nfor right now it's just available.\n\n1195\n01:07:12.395 --> 01:07:16.960\nActually, one way that I use it,\nI use it for testing SMTP servers.\n\n1196\n01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:20.343\nSo SMTP, it runs on TCP port 25.\n\n1197\n01:07:20.343 --> 01:07:23.120\nI could Telnet into a server.\n\n1198\n01:07:23.120 --> 01:07:27.350\nWell, actually, I'm running SMTP, I think.\n\n1199\n01:07:27.350 --> 01:07:31.480\nSo I can Telnet into\nport 25 on my own system.\n\n1200\n01:07:31.480 --> 01:07:34.430\nAnd see how I'm connected to Postfix?\n\n1201\n01:07:34.430 --> 01:07:39.061\nSo I can come in here and\nI can manually craft a message,\n\n1202\n01:07:39.061 --> 01:07:41.591\nif I can remember the syntax.\n\n1203\n01:07:44.727 --> 01:07:47.220\nLet's see if I can remember it all.\n\n1204\n01:07:47.220 --> 01:07:48.340\nIs there no space?\n\n1205\n01:07:48.340 --> 01:07:50.277\nMessage from.\n\n1206\n01:07:50.277 --> 01:07:52.760\n>> I don't know.\n\n1207\n01:07:52.760 --> 01:07:57.369\n>> If you can remember the syntax,\nyou can manually craft an email.\n\n1208\n01:07:57.369 --> 01:07:59.356\n>> I can break the rules too [LAUGH].\n\n1209\n01:07:59.356 --> 01:08:02.167\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah,\napparently I don't remember the command.\n\n1210\n01:08:02.167 --> 01:08:07.906\nSo you do a message from, a receipt to,\nand then you specify the email message,\n\n1211\n01:08:07.906 --> 01:08:11.020\nand so you can go through and\nkinda do that.\n\n1212\n01:08:11.020 --> 01:08:12.730\nI don't remember the actual syntax.\n\n1213\n01:08:12.730 --> 01:08:14.980\nBut anyhow, so\nyou can manually put an email in.\n\n1214\n01:08:14.980 --> 01:08:18.480\nIt's a great way to test an SMTP\nserver without a client.\n\n1215\n01:08:18.480 --> 01:08:21.540\nSo now you eliminate your\nmail client as the problem.\n\n1216\n01:08:21.540 --> 01:08:22.840\nMaybe you're using Thunderbird and\n\n1217\n01:08:22.840 --> 01:08:24.470\nyou're not sure if that's\nwhat's causing the problem or\n\n1218\n01:08:24.470 --> 01:08:26.060\nnot, this takes it out of the equation.\n\n1219\n01:08:26.060 --> 01:08:30.526\nSo I use Telnet to troubleshoot\nwith SMTP servers, and\n\n1220\n01:08:30.526 --> 01:08:33.159\nservers like that, a good bit.\n\n1221\n01:08:33.159 --> 01:08:36.370\nAll right, let's see what else do we have?\n\n1222\n01:08:36.370 --> 01:08:38.090\nInformation gathering.\n\n1223\n01:08:38.090 --> 01:08:42.325\nSo If I'm running a server on my system,\nmaybe I don't know.\n\n1224\n01:08:42.325 --> 01:08:45.038\nSo like Telnet,\nam I running a Telnet server?\n\n1225\n01:08:45.038 --> 01:08:45.733\nI hope not.\n\n1226\n01:08:45.733 --> 01:08:47.312\nIt's not secure, I better not be.\n\n1227\n01:08:47.312 --> 01:08:49.529\nAm I running SSH, am I running those?\n\n1228\n01:08:49.529 --> 01:08:52.869\nWell, some of them you can use\nthe services command to find them,\n\n1229\n01:08:52.869 --> 01:08:54.530\nbut some are really confusing.\n\n1230\n01:08:54.530 --> 01:08:59.300\nLike if I'm running a Telnet server, it's\nactually a part of the extended Internet\n\n1231\n01:08:59.300 --> 01:09:03.362\ndemon, so the xinetd, and so if you do a,\n\n1232\n01:09:03.362 --> 01:09:07.700\nservices --status-all,\n\n1233\n01:09:07.700 --> 01:09:12.290\nif you're running a Telnet server,\nit won't show up as Telnet.\n\n1234\n01:09:12.290 --> 01:09:15.300\nSorry, it's service --status-all.\n\n1235\n01:09:15.300 --> 01:09:16.690\nIt won't show up as Telnet, so\n\n1236\n01:09:16.690 --> 01:09:20.110\nit's not immediately obvious whether\nyou're running Telnet or not.\n\n1237\n01:09:21.350 --> 01:09:28.410\nSo an easier way to spot that would be to\nsay, all right, Telnet uses TCP port 23.\n\n1238\n01:09:28.410 --> 01:09:30.735\nAm I listening on port 23?\n\n1239\n01:09:30.735 --> 01:09:34.500\nIf my servers are listening on port 23,\nthen I'm probably running Telnet.\n\n1240\n01:09:34.500 --> 01:09:39.780\nAnd so we can use the netstat command\nto see what ports we're listening on so\n\n1241\n01:09:39.780 --> 01:09:42.470\nwe can figure out what we're running or\nwhat we aren't.\n\n1242\n01:09:42.470 --> 01:09:46.280\nThe way I normally run it is with -atp.\n\n1243\n01:09:46.280 --> 01:09:53.340\nA means show me all my connections, my\nlistening and my idle or established ones.\n\n1244\n01:09:53.340 --> 01:09:58.300\nT and p says to show me the protocol and\ngive them a name so\n\n1245\n01:09:58.300 --> 01:10:01.300\nI don't have to remember what port\nmatches to what protocol name.\n\n1246\n01:10:01.300 --> 01:10:04.010\nSo I normally do -atp like that.\n\n1247\n01:10:04.010 --> 01:10:07.789\nAnd it'll give you a list of\nwhat you're listening on, and\n\n1248\n01:10:07.789 --> 01:10:09.762\nI can see that I am running SSH.\n\n1249\n01:10:09.762 --> 01:10:14.280\nSo I'm currently listening on TCP and\nthen it turned it to SSH.\n\n1250\n01:10:14.280 --> 01:10:16.586\nIt would have said 22 normally.\n\n1251\n01:10:16.586 --> 01:10:19.220\nAnd I can see it's\nthe SSHD that's doing it.\n\n1252\n01:10:19.220 --> 01:10:22.340\nI can see that I've got the Internet\nprinting protocol turned on,\n\n1253\n01:10:22.340 --> 01:10:24.340\nand that's part of cups.\n\n1254\n01:10:24.340 --> 01:10:28.480\nI've got SMTP running, something running\n\n1255\n01:10:28.480 --> 01:10:34.180\non 44385 which is RPC status apparently,\nwe've got SSH again.\n\n1256\n01:10:34.180 --> 01:10:36.340\nSo we've got a couple of\nconnections that are in place.\n\n1257\n01:10:36.340 --> 01:10:39.920\nI can skim down this list and get a good\nidea of what servers I'm running.\n\n1258\n01:10:39.920 --> 01:10:44.551\nIf I turn on Telnet, which I'll actually\ndo in the next show, in the security show,\n\n1259\n01:10:44.551 --> 01:10:48.006\nif we turn that on, we would see\nit in here as being listening and\n\n1260\n01:10:48.006 --> 01:10:49.857\nwe'd see it attached to xinetd.\n\n1261\n01:10:49.857 --> 01:10:54.680\nThat's where we can make that\nconnection of what software is\n\n1262\n01:10:54.680 --> 01:10:57.930\nit that's actually opening this port.\n\n1263\n01:10:57.930 --> 01:11:00.093\nWhat's something I could\nwhip up real quick?\n\n1264\n01:11:03.552 --> 01:11:06.962\nI don't remember if Dovecot will\nautomatically start POP3 and\n\n1265\n01:11:06.962 --> 01:11:08.540\nIMAP4 without a config, and\n\n1266\n01:11:08.540 --> 01:11:12.342\nI don't want to get into some giant\nconfiguration just to turn this on.\n\n1267\n01:11:14.884 --> 01:11:15.779\nWe'll do a test here.\n\n1268\n01:11:18.426 --> 01:11:23.440\nAll right, so Dovecot, if you've never\nheard of it, it's a POP3 and IMAP4 server.\n\n1269\n01:11:23.440 --> 01:11:27.050\nAnd I didn't do any configuration, I just\nstarted it, and I can see it started IMAP.\n\n1270\n01:11:27.050 --> 01:11:29.320\nSo I should now see a listener.\n\n1271\n01:11:30.690 --> 01:11:32.558\nLet me pipe that into more.\n\n1272\n01:11:32.558 --> 01:11:35.770\nAll right, so I should see a listener,\nsure enough, right there.\n\n1273\n01:11:35.770 --> 01:11:40.140\nSo I can see that I'm now\nlistening on TCP for POP3 and\n\n1274\n01:11:40.140 --> 01:11:42.600\nIMAP and\nthat it's Dovecot that's doing it.\n\n1275\n01:11:42.600 --> 01:11:45.575\nSo I now know that I'm running POP3 and\nIMAP.\n\n1276\n01:11:45.575 --> 01:11:48.440\nNetstat is a great command for\ntroubleshooting just to see if the servers\n\n1277\n01:11:48.440 --> 01:11:50.130\nare actually doing what\nthey're supposed to do.\n\n1278\n01:11:50.130 --> 01:11:52.580\nIt's also a good command for security.\n\n1279\n01:11:52.580 --> 01:11:56.950\nSo we'll see it again because I\nmight not wanna run POP3 and IMAP.\n\n1280\n01:11:56.950 --> 01:11:58.390\nThey're not secure.\n\n1281\n01:11:58.390 --> 01:12:01.140\nI see I am running imaps also.\n\n1282\n01:12:01.140 --> 01:12:04.190\nSo I am running the secure version of\nIMAP and the secure version of POP3.\n\n1283\n01:12:04.190 --> 01:12:08.022\nSo maybe I need to go and\ndisable the non-secure versions.\n\n1284\n01:12:08.022 --> 01:12:10.066\nNow I know to do it\nbecause I can see it here.\n\n1285\n01:12:10.066 --> 01:12:12.015\nSo Netstat is pretty handy.\n\n1286\n01:12:12.015 --> 01:12:17.533\nIf I reran that and left the a off and\njust did that netstat -tp all right,\n\n1287\n01:12:17.533 --> 01:12:22.621\nnow it shows me just the ones that\nhave active connections to them.\n\n1288\n01:12:22.621 --> 01:12:29.437\nAnd so I don't have any active connections\nright now so there's nothing there and\n\n1289\n01:12:29.437 --> 01:12:33.902\nif I leave off the p and\nno not p I need to leave off the t.\n\n1290\n01:12:33.902 --> 01:12:35.766\nIf I leave off the t.\n\n1291\n01:12:35.766 --> 01:12:37.180\nShoot, which one?\n\n1292\n01:12:37.180 --> 01:12:39.270\nHang on,\none of these shows me the port number.\n\n1293\n01:12:39.270 --> 01:12:41.403\nLet me just leave them all off, there.\n\n1294\n01:12:41.403 --> 01:12:45.046\nLeaving them all off you get a slightly\nmore laid out representation of what's\n\n1295\n01:12:45.046 --> 01:12:45.960\nrunning.\n\n1296\n01:12:45.960 --> 01:12:49.041\nAnd, actually hang on, I need to say.\n\n1297\n01:12:52.628 --> 01:12:55.590\nWell, shoot, now that it's done, and\nit's not gonna show me those port numbers.\n\n1298\n01:12:55.590 --> 01:12:58.700\nSo, there is a command tag where you can\ntell it to go ahead and show me the port\n\n1299\n01:12:58.700 --> 01:13:03.600\nnumbers instead of doing the name and\nmine is just showing it all out so.\n\n1300\n01:13:03.600 --> 01:13:07.258\nBut powerful command, mostly cuz we\ncan see what's running on our server.\n\n1301\n01:13:07.258 --> 01:13:11.088\nIf this is the first time you've sat down\non that server, you don't know who's\n\n1302\n01:13:11.088 --> 01:13:15.341\nworked on it, you don't know what they've\ndone in the past, so a quick netstat-atp.\n\n1303\n01:13:15.341 --> 01:13:18.292\nThat'll give us that list,\nwe see everything that we're listening on,\n\n1304\n01:13:18.292 --> 01:13:21.290\nyou know what it is that's spawning,\nwhat's causing that connection and\n\n1305\n01:13:21.290 --> 01:13:23.810\nthen we can go and\nturn things off if we don't need it.\n\n1306\n01:13:23.810 --> 01:13:28.952\nMaybe I don't want pop3 and\nimap at all so I can do a.\n\n1307\n01:13:31.894 --> 01:13:33.670\nA remove, I can get dovecot out of there.\n\n1308\n01:13:34.720 --> 01:13:36.750\nSo I'm just gonna go yum remove dovecot.\n\n1309\n01:13:36.750 --> 01:13:39.389\nSo now it's out, and\nI can go back and check and\n\n1310\n01:13:39.389 --> 01:13:41.778\nI'm no longer listening on those ports.\n\n1311\n01:13:44.774 --> 01:13:46.060\nAll right.\n\n1312\n01:13:46.060 --> 01:13:49.490\nThe last thing I wanna show is kind\nof a useful one with wireless.\n\n1313\n01:13:49.490 --> 01:13:53.600\nEvery now and then, wireless adapters can\njust get stuck, and they don't connect or\n\n1314\n01:13:53.600 --> 01:13:54.480\nwhatever, and\n\n1315\n01:13:54.480 --> 01:13:57.930\na reboot will fix the problem, but\nyou should never have to reboot.\n\n1316\n01:13:57.930 --> 01:14:01.920\nSo it's easier to just to turn the network\nadapter off and turn it back on again.\n\n1317\n01:14:01.920 --> 01:14:06.030\nThere are times when its useful to turn\nadapters off maybe you just don't intend\n\n1318\n01:14:06.030 --> 01:14:11.430\non using it, you're tired of seeing it on\nyour command output so you turn them off.\n\n1319\n01:14:11.430 --> 01:14:17.820\nThere's the ifup and ifdown commands,\nand they work really easy.\n\n1320\n01:14:17.820 --> 01:14:22.350\nYou just say, ifdown and the name of\nthe interface you want to turn off.\n\n1321\n01:14:22.350 --> 01:14:24.450\nSo I'm gonna turn off eth0 Zero, right?\n\n1322\n01:14:24.450 --> 01:14:25.300\nSo ethernet zero,\n\n1323\n01:14:25.300 --> 01:14:30.740\nthat one's gonna turn off and\nif I do an ifconfig, it's completely gone.\n\n1324\n01:14:30.740 --> 01:14:35.620\nAs far as the system is concerned,\nETH zero is now off, and\n\n1325\n01:14:35.620 --> 01:14:41.600\nif I run IF Up, I can turn it back on\nagain, and there it goes, initializing.\n\n1326\n01:14:41.600 --> 01:14:47.000\nAnd I can do a ifconfig,\nand I'll see it back.\n\n1327\n01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:50.150\nNow, ifdown and\nifup are temporary commands.\n\n1328\n01:14:50.150 --> 01:14:51.152\nIf you reboot,\n\n1329\n01:14:51.152 --> 01:14:55.600\nit's gonna come back to whatever state is\nin the network script of that interface.\n\n1330\n01:14:55.600 --> 01:14:58.970\nSo, back there where we\nhad on boot equals yes or\n\n1331\n01:14:58.970 --> 01:15:02.710\non boot equals no,\nthat's basically if up and if down.\n\n1332\n01:15:02.710 --> 01:15:04.980\nIt's just when you reboot\nthat's what takes affect.\n\n1333\n01:15:04.980 --> 01:15:08.400\nSo if I turn it off now and I reboot,\nthe card will be back on when I reboot.\n\n1334\n01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:12.290\nSo if I want it off forever I need\nto go and modify it in the script.\n\n1335\n01:15:12.290 --> 01:15:14.430\nBut if I'm just doing\nsomething temporary to test,\n\n1336\n01:15:14.430 --> 01:15:16.490\nlike resetting my wireless connection.\n\n1337\n01:15:16.490 --> 01:15:22.428\nI F down and\nI F up is a great way to do it.\n\n1338\n01:15:22.428 --> 01:15:25.018\nThen there is always\nservice network restart.\n\n1339\n01:15:25.018 --> 01:15:29.208\nThe problem with service network restart\nis it effects all of your networking.\n\n1340\n01:15:29.208 --> 01:15:32.470\nIf you wanna do your wireless, it will do\nyour physical and your other ones too.\n\n1341\n01:15:32.470 --> 01:15:35.530\nIt restarts all of your network adapters,\nbasically it turns them off.\n\n1342\n01:15:35.530 --> 01:15:36.680\nAnd turns them back on again.\n\n1343\n01:15:36.680 --> 01:15:41.670\nSo, you've got that one and\nyou can use stop to just shut them off.\n\n1344\n01:15:41.670 --> 01:15:44.020\nAnd now they're all off, right?\n\n1345\n01:15:44.020 --> 01:15:46.130\nI don't even get my loopback any more.\n\n1346\n01:15:46.130 --> 01:15:48.956\nAnd then we can turn them back\non with service network start.\n\n1347\n01:15:52.451 --> 01:15:53.285\nAll right, so\n\n1348\n01:15:53.285 --> 01:15:57.951\nthose are some of the commands that we can\nuse in the troubleshooting side of it.\n\n1349\n01:15:57.951 --> 01:16:00.050\nPing and the configuration files.\n\n1350\n01:16:00.050 --> 01:16:02.970\nThose are normally the two that I use,\ncheck your configuration to make\n\n1351\n01:16:02.970 --> 01:16:06.350\nit's right, use Ping to figure\nout how far out you can get.\n\n1352\n01:16:06.350 --> 01:16:09.180\nTrace route, trace path,\nthey're pretty handy too.\n\n1353\n01:16:09.180 --> 01:16:12.520\nIFConfig, super handy because\nyou see that information.\n\n1354\n01:16:12.520 --> 01:16:14.230\nJust making sure your\nconfigurations are right, though,\n\n1355\n01:16:14.230 --> 01:16:16.320\nthat's normally where\nyour problems stem from.\n\n1356\n01:16:16.320 --> 01:16:20.552\nCould always have a an unplugged cable\nthough so remember, sometimes it’s\n\n1357\n01:16:20.552 --> 01:16:24.995\na lot more simpler of a problem and plug\nyour cable back in your back in business.\n\n1358\n01:16:24.995 --> 01:16:28.569\nAll right, well, I think that pretty much\nwraps everything we've got on networking.\n\n1359\n01:16:28.569 --> 01:16:30.110\nRon can you think of\nanything we've missed?\n\n1360\n01:16:30.110 --> 01:16:34.680\n>> No, just remember, basic networking\nknowledge is what we're testing on here.\n\n1361\n01:16:34.680 --> 01:16:38.240\nSo, if you're not familiar with that,\ndon't forget hit there's never clusters.\n\n1362\n01:16:38.240 --> 01:16:41.648\nMake sure you get very familiar with\nthat before you go on for the exam.\n\n1363\n01:16:41.648 --> 01:16:42.252\n>> Yeah.\n\n1364\n01:16:42.252 --> 01:16:46.139\nAnd as always, if you have any questions\non this stuff, live during the show\n\n1365\n01:16:46.139 --> 01:16:49.928\nyou can go to itpro.tv/live you can\nsee the chatroom beneath the

think you've answered\nmost of the questions.\n\n1376\n01:17:08.301 --> 01:17:09.908\n>> That's right.\n\n1377\n01:17:09.908 --> 01:17:11.242\n>> So, definitely use that resource.\n\n1378\n01:17:11.242 --> 01:17:12.626\nIt is there for you.\n\n1379\n01:17:12.626 --> 01:17:14.304\nRight.\nWe wanna make sure you guys have\n\n1380\n01:17:14.304 --> 01:17:16.780\nthe information you need to\nbe successful on that exam.\n\n1381\n01:17:17.820 --> 01:17:21.267\nAll right, well, signing off for\nIT Pro TV, I'm Don Pezet.\n\n1382\n01:17:21.267 --> 01:17:21.918\n>> I'm

00:00:37.050\nAlright good morning, good afternoon and\ngood evening and welcome back.\n\n5\n00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.470\nTo another episode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:42.090\nI'm your host Don Pizet, back with Mr.\nNate Copeland, how's it going Nate?\n\n7\n00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.310\n>> Pretty good Don, pretty good,\npretty excited, pumped up for\n\n8\n00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:50.640\ntoday's episode, I'm glad that you\nhad me on to, this, today's show, so.\n\n9\n00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.990\nI'm yeah, pretty psyched, and eager.\n\n10\n00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.770\nWaiting for it.\n\n11\n00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:55.460\n>> We've got a special episode.\n\n12\n00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:56.460\nFor a couple of reasons.\n\n13\n00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.280\nRight?\nOne because it's really the last objective\n\n14\n00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.500\nfor Linux+ exams.\n\n15\n00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.410\nWe're going to be wrapping it up here.\n\n16\n00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:03.455\nSo that's exciting.\n\n17\n00:01:03.455 --> 00:01:06.060\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Another reason is it's security.\n\n18\n00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.410\nWhich is a hot button topic.\n\n19\n00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:10.780\nAnd so everything in this episode\nis essential knowledge for\n\n20\n00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:11.940\nsomebody who's supporting Linux.\n\n21\n00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:13.290\nThat's cool too.\n\n22\n00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:19.160\nBut the reason I'm excited Is that I have\nbeen violating security practices in every\n\n23\n00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:23.570\nsingle episode up to this point because we\nhadn't learned a couple of commands yet.\n\n24\n00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:24.950\nWe're gonna learn those commands today.\n\n25\n00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.740\nSo, I can show you guys the proper way\nto do something which is important so\n\n26\n00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:30.590\nI'm excited to do that.\n\n27\n00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.880\nCuz I can just see already\nthe amount of emails I'm gonna get.\n\n28\n00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.180\nJohn you're doing this wrong.\n\n29\n00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.120\nAnd I know I'm doing it wrong.\n\n30\n00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:41.980\nI haven't learned that command yet,\nso we're getting to that.\n\n31\n00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:45.400\nAnyhow, all things shall be revealed,\nright?\n\n32\n00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:50.440\nIn this special season-ending whatever,\nthank you.\n\n33\n00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:51.840\nSo all right, it's good.\n\n34\n00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.810\n[LAUGH] Let's just jump into our stuff.\n\n35\n00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.240\nAll right, security in Linux.\n\n36\n00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.610\nUnlike a lot of operating systems out\nthere, Linux is very transparent.\n\n37\n00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:02.870\nSo it's open source.\n\n38\n00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:06.140\nAnybody can do code review if\nthere are vulnerabilities,\n\n39\n00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:07.980\npatches and updates come out very fast.\n\n40\n00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:10.690\nAnd so for the most part all we\nhave to do is do our update.\n\n41\n00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.950\nDates.\nIf it's a Red Hat, you do yum update and\n\n42\n00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:16.570\nit'll run, find the updates and\nbring them in.\n\n43\n00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:18.050\nSo we're cool there.\n\n44\n00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.570\nYou got that functionality,\nit's real easy.\n\n45\n00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:23.680\nBut there's more things that\nwe need to do on our part\n\n46\n00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.970\nto ensure that we're using\nthe system securely, okay?\n\n47\n00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.530\nSo that's what we're gonna take\na look at here in this segment,\n\n48\n00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.180\nas we move through and\nlook at some of the different stuff.\n\n49\n00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.490\nI wanna start off talking\nabout permissions.\n\n50\n00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:37.790\nWe had a whole episode on permissions,\nand you might be saying,\n\n51\n00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.236\nDon I'm kinda tired of hearing about them.\n\n52\n00:02:39.236 --> 00:02:45.470\nBut there was a secret permission\nthat we didn't talk about, okay.\n\n53\n00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.420\nIt's like the first rule of fight club,\nyou don't talk about fight club.\n\n54\n00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.464\nSo, the first rule of secret permissions\nis [CROSSTALK] talking about them,\n\n55\n00:02:52.464 --> 00:02:53.611\nyeah,yeah, yeah.\n\n56\n00:02:53.611 --> 00:02:57.211\nSo, [LAUGH] but when it's done,\nI get to punch you in the face, I think?\n\n57\n00:02:57.211 --> 00:03:00.100\n>> What?\n[LAUGH] Okay, if I go first.\n\n58\n00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:07.310\n>> [LAUGH] That's a deal so\nanyhow normally whenever we run a program,\n\n59\n00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.050\nyour Linux operating system will double\ncheck the permissions on the file and\n\n60\n00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:12.830\never file has permissions, right?\n\n61\n00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:16.350\nSo if I take a look at the files in my\nhome directory I can see here where\n\n62\n00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:21.250\nthey've got permissions for the owner,\npermissions for the group and\n\n63\n00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.870\nthe permissions for the other users,\nso we learned that as u for\n\n64\n00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.225\nusers, g for group and o for others.\n\n65\n00:03:29.225 --> 00:03:31.605\nAll right?\nAnd so it's just three values, rwx, okay?\n\n66\n00:03:33.095 --> 00:03:36.575\nRwx, that's read, write, and execute.\n\n67\n00:03:36.575 --> 00:03:39.635\nNow, when we execute a file,\nif we've got execute permissions on it and\n\n68\n00:03:39.635 --> 00:03:43.680\nwe execute it, it executes\nunder r permissions, all right?\n\n69\n00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.140\nSo if I'm logged in as root and\n\n70\n00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:52.190\nI run the passwd dpezet command, right.\n\n71\n00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:55.670\nI'm about to reset dpezet's password and\n\n72\n00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:00.700\npasswd is going to run as well\nnormally run as me, as root, okay.\n\n73\n00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:04.930\nAnd as a root user I have\naccess to write to things.\n\n74\n00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:11.925\nIf we do ls -la,\nif I take a look at that passwd file,\n\n75\n00:04:11.925 --> 00:04:16.490\n/etc/passwd, I can see on the permissions\n\n76\n00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:21.290\nas a root user, I have read and write.\n\n77\n00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:25.110\nEveryone else just has read on this file,\nbut I've got read and write.\n\n78\n00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:27.550\nOkay, so I can manipulate that file.\n\n79\n00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:32.120\nAnd if I take a look at\nthe shadow password file,\n\n80\n00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.960\nI can see nobody has access to that,\nnot even me as the owner.\n\n81\n00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.490\nI'm root and I don't have access to that.\n\n82\n00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:39.130\nOkay?\n\n83\n00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:43.940\nSo, if I don't have access to it,\nhow is it that I'm able to go in and\n\n84\n00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:44.470\nlook at that file?\n\n85\n00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:47.250\nHow am I able to reset passwords if\nI don't have access to that file?\n\n86\n00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:47.820\nRight?\n\n87\n00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:49.310\nWell, the better question is,\n\n88\n00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:52.290\nhow is a regular user able\nto change their password,\n\n89\n00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:57.360\nbecause a regular user can't even write to\nthis file, better yet that shadow file.\n\n90\n00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.560\nSo let me jump over here\nto another terminal and\n\n91\n00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.160\nI'm going to log in as my user, dpezet.\n\n92\n00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:03.170\nAll right.\n\n93\n00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:08.770\nSo here I am, and as a regular user,\nif I run passwd when I run that,\n\n94\n00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:12.760\nit says I can change my password and\nI need to punch in my current password, so\n\n95\n00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:17.430\nI'll do that, and\nnow I need to punch in a new password, and\n\n96\n00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:19.920\nI'm picking something simple so\nit's gonna gripe at me.\n\n97\n00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:21.680\nIt's gonna stop me outright?\n\n98\n00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:25.150\nWell that's lame anyhow,\nI'll punch in a different password.\n\n99\n00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:27.660\nReally.\n\n100\n00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:28.625\nWell, anyhow.\n\n101\n00:05:28.625 --> 00:05:31.089\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] If I can pick, you know,\n\n102\n00:05:31.089 --> 00:05:35.620\nlet me pick some crazy password\nthat will make it happy.\n\n103\n00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:41.820\nAll right, so, token manipulation error.\n\n104\n00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:44.120\nWell, now it's just taunting me.\n\n105\n00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:46.720\nBut as a regular user,\nI can come in here and I can run.\n\n106\n00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:51.210\nYou know what, it's asking for my current\npassword and I'm not putting it in,\n\n107\n00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:51.740\nthat's my problem.\n\n108\n00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:53.760\nSo I need to put in my old password and\n\n109\n00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:58.155\nthen I can put in my new password,\nI don't think I typed it right.\n\n110\n00:05:58.155 --> 00:06:04.998\n[LAUGH] [CROSSTALK] so it's gonna take\nme twenty minutes to reset my password.\n\n111\n00:06:04.998 --> 00:06:06.710\nAll right let me just,\nI won't go crazy here.\n\n112\n00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:11.190\nI'll put in something very complex, there.\n\n113\n00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:14.730\nOkay, now as an end user I\njust changed my password.\n\n114\n00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:18.820\nThat means it reached out to passwd,\nwhere my account was.\n\n115\n00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:21.430\nAnd it tried to write the password\nthere and the system intercepted that.\n\n116\n00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:23.920\nAnd actually wrote the password\nto the shadow file.\n\n117\n00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:26.060\nI don't have access to the shadow file.\n\n118\n00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:29.040\nAnd the passwd file,\nI've only got read access.\n\n119\n00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:30.200\nI can't change it.\n\n120\n00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:32.050\nSo how did that happen?\n\n121\n00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:34.185\nWell, there's a special attribute,\n\n122\n00:06:34.185 --> 00:06:37.168\na special permission attached\nto the passwd command.\n\n123\n00:06:37.168 --> 00:06:41.128\nAnd it's called the SUID bit.\n\n124\n00:06:41.128 --> 00:06:45.240\nAll right.\nThe SUID bit, is a special permission that\n\n125\n00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:51.390\nwe can attach to a file that says,\ndon't run as the user running the program.\n\n126\n00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:56.130\nInstead, run as the owner of the program.\n\n127\n00:06:56.130 --> 00:07:03.560\nIf I find the passwd program\nif I say which passwd.\n\n128\n00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:05.640\nAnd I find it, so there it is.\n\n129\n00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:11.160\nAnd I do an ls -la of that, there it is.\n\n130\n00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:13.520\nAnd I can see it is owned by root.\n\n131\n00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:18.719\nAnd look at this extra value I have here,\nrws.\n\n132\n00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:21.858\nWhat the heck is that S?\n\n133\n00:07:21.858 --> 00:07:27.634\nThat's that special SUID bit and what it's\nsaying is when somebody runs this program,\n\n134\n00:07:27.634 --> 00:07:31.314\nwhen dpezet ran this program,\ndon't run it as dpezet.\n\n135\n00:07:31.314 --> 00:07:33.135\nRun it as the owner.\n\n136\n00:07:33.135 --> 00:07:36.042\nRun it as root.\n\n137\n00:07:36.042 --> 00:07:37.720\nAnd you can do the same thing with group.\n\n138\n00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:40.800\nSo you might have r -s here, and\n\n139\n00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:43.760\nthen it would run as the group\ninstead of as the user.\n\n140\n00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:44.850\nYou just set one or the other.\n\n141\n00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:46.450\nYou never send them both.\n\n142\n00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:48.380\nSo we'd say one or the other.\n\n143\n00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:50.750\nYou can set both,\nyou just wouldn't normally do that.\n\n144\n00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:53.310\nBut it's going to run\non behalf of that user.\n\n145\n00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:55.080\nSo that's what's happening here.\n\n146\n00:07:55.080 --> 00:08:00.367\nWhen I was logged in as dpezet and\nI ran passwd, it actually ran as root.\n\n147\n00:08:00.367 --> 00:08:02.503\nTo do its job, to change that password.\n\n148\n00:08:02.503 --> 00:08:06.520\nNow, obviously that is\nextremely dangerous.\n\n149\n00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:10.410\nSo applications like passwd have\nbeen written to handle that.\n\n150\n00:08:10.410 --> 00:08:12.900\nThey've gotten security checks and\nprotections in there.\n\n151\n00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:16.950\nSo that all they can do is change\na password when a regular user runs them.\n\n152\n00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:24.150\nBut we can add that special bit to a file\nand have it run on behalf of another user.\n\n153\n00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:27.460\nAnd that can really open\nus up to compromises.\n\n154\n00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:29.946\nThat's one of the reasons why when\nit colorizes it's all bright red.\n\n155\n00:08:29.946 --> 00:08:33.870\nIt's like warning, here's a file\nthat's been flagged with passwd.\n\n156\n00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:37.860\nI mean, got flagged with the SUID bit,\nbe really careful.\n\n157\n00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:39.926\nSo when we maintain a system,\n\n158\n00:08:39.926 --> 00:08:45.134\none of the things we need to do as part\nof our security audit as we evaluate our\n\n159\n00:08:45.134 --> 00:08:50.529\nsystem is to keep track of which files\nare flagged with the SUID bit like this.\n\n160\n00:08:50.529 --> 00:08:55.840\nAnd there's some easy ways to\ncheck it using the find command.\n\n161\n00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:59.190\nWe saw find in an earlier episode cuz\nit would let us search the hard drive\n\n162\n00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:00.130\nfor files.\n\n163\n00:09:00.130 --> 00:09:02.640\nWe were doing searches by name earlier.\n\n164\n00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:05.190\nBut we can do searches by permission also.\n\n165\n00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:09.610\nAnd we can generate a list of all\nprograms with the SUID bit flag.\n\n166\n00:09:09.610 --> 00:09:12.664\nSo what we can do is we can say find, and\n\n167\n00:09:12.664 --> 00:09:17.819\nI'll just search the /user/bin folder and\nI'm gonna look for\n\n168\n00:09:17.819 --> 00:09:23.166\nfiles with a certain set of permissions,\nand what I'm looking for\n\n169\n00:09:23.166 --> 00:09:28.536\nis where the user has the s attribute\nattached to it, the SUID bit.\n\n170\n00:09:28.536 --> 00:09:33.510\nSo show me any file in there where\nthe user has the s attribute.\n\n171\n00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:37.902\nAnd I can see a bunch of them that\nare in here, like crontab, chage,\n\n172\n00:09:37.902 --> 00:09:40.153\nwhich we'll see later, passwd.\n\n173\n00:09:40.153 --> 00:09:46.284\nThose are those commands that a regular\nuser may need elevated permissions for.\n\n174\n00:09:46.284 --> 00:09:48.769\nA change Shell, chsh down at the bottom,\n\n175\n00:09:48.769 --> 00:09:52.765\nif you change your shell it's\ngotta write that to /etc/passwd.\n\n176\n00:09:52.765 --> 00:09:59.650\nSo a regular user can't do it, it will\nrun as root, effectively, to do it.\n\n177\n00:09:59.650 --> 00:10:03.120\nSo the idea here is that we\ncould run a search like this and\n\n178\n00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:05.180\ncreate a list of the files.\n\n179\n00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:07.740\nAnd then, periodically when\nwe do our security audits,\n\n180\n00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:11.030\nwe can generate the list again and\ncompare them for differences.\n\n181\n00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:12.530\nAnd if we see any differences,\n\n182\n00:10:12.530 --> 00:10:15.080\nthose are more files that have\nbeen flagged with the SUID bit.\n\n183\n00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:18.760\nAnd we need to go and evaluate those and\nfind out, was it done on purpose?\n\n184\n00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:19.690\nIs it secure?\n\n185\n00:10:19.690 --> 00:10:21.860\nIs it software that's\ndesigned to handle that?\n\n186\n00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:26.510\nOr is somebody using that to circumvent\npermissions on your system, to\n\n187\n00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:31.110\ncircumvent the security measures in place,\nso we definitely need to watch for that.\n\n188\n00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:34.920\nNow, I just looked for the user bit,\nwe can also do the group,\n\n189\n00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:38.180\ncuz you can do the SUID bit flag for\na group and\n\n190\n00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:41.450\nI can see here there's a few that\nare like that also, the locate command.\n\n191\n00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:45.421\nRemember locate will help us find files\ntoo by querying a database that normal\n\n192\n00:10:45.421 --> 00:10:49.100\nusers aren't able to access and\nso we've got that one there, too.\n\n193\n00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:50.770\nAnd a handful of other commands.\n\n194\n00:10:50.770 --> 00:10:55.650\nNow, I'm limiting this down\njust to the /usr/bin folder.\n\n195\n00:10:55.650 --> 00:11:01.015\nIf I'm doing a full audit though, I'm\ngonna do that against the entire drive.\n\n196\n00:11:01.015 --> 00:11:03.085\nAnd it all find a lot more.\n\n197\n00:11:03.085 --> 00:11:04.635\nThere's files that are over.\n\n198\n00:11:04.635 --> 00:11:08.715\nIt's important to go ahead and\ndo this and scan your system so\n\n199\n00:11:08.715 --> 00:11:10.765\nyou got a full record of\nthe ones under there.\n\n200\n00:11:10.765 --> 00:11:12.645\nMine's a basin install, so\n\n201\n00:11:12.645 --> 00:11:15.545\nI would have a good record of\nwhat I should have expect to see.\n\n202\n00:11:15.545 --> 00:11:19.505\nI could then run the same search on\na production server and compare the two.\n\n203\n00:11:19.505 --> 00:11:24.037\nAny differences would be\nsomewhere where we had an issue.\n\n204\n00:11:24.037 --> 00:11:28.590\nNow, you can do usr in group.\n\n205\n00:11:28.590 --> 00:11:30.450\nBut I had to do two different commands for\nthat, and\n\n206\n00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:33.580\nthat's because I'm using the symbolic\nreference for those permissions.\n\n207\n00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:38.625\nIf I used the numerical one,\nthe equivalent of doing\n\n208\n00:11:38.625 --> 00:11:44.830\nu+s would be to search for\none that has + 4000.\n\n209\n00:11:44.830 --> 00:11:48.940\nRemember we have like 755 was rewrite\nexecute and then read net new,\n\n210\n00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:49.773\nread net new.\n\n211\n00:11:49.773 --> 00:11:50.817\nThat was 755.\n\n212\n00:11:50.817 --> 00:11:52.740\nThe numerical notation.\n\n213\n00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:56.600\nWell, the SUID bit it's\nactually like a fourth bit.\n\n214\n00:11:56.600 --> 00:12:01.141\nSo what I'm saying is +4000, I'm just\nsaying look for anybody that's got that\n\n215\n00:12:01.141 --> 00:12:06.510\nSUID bit, the 4, and then 000 those are\nthe remaining 3 I don't really care about.\n\n216\n00:12:06.510 --> 00:12:09.224\nAnd so, we can search through and\nfind them, and so\n\n217\n00:12:09.224 --> 00:12:11.130\nhere it goes making that same list.\n\n218\n00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:16.890\nThat is the same exact thing I got\nback when I did the user, u+s.\n\n219\n00:12:16.890 --> 00:12:19.140\nSame list, so no difference there.\n\n220\n00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:21.950\nThe reason I bring it up here is cuz\nit's harder to do it this way, so\n\n221\n00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:22.850\nwhy would we want to?\n\n222\n00:12:22.850 --> 00:12:25.714\nWell, 4,000, that's users.\n\n223\n00:12:25.714 --> 00:12:28.464\n2,000, that's groups.\n\n224\n00:12:28.464 --> 00:12:33.780\n6,000, that one is both users and groups.\n\n225\n00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:38.580\nYou can't do that with the symbolic\nnotation, but the numerical notation,\n\n226\n00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:40.230\nyou can do it and it'll get both.\n\n227\n00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:45.120\nOnes that have SUID set for users,\nand ones that have SUID for groups,\n\n228\n00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:47.550\nso you can get them all\nin one nice command.\n\n229\n00:12:47.550 --> 00:12:48.960\nSo you can run this.\n\n230\n00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:52.920\nBuild up your list of all\nthe SUID flagged stuff.\n\n231\n00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:56.700\nAnd then, use that to compare to in the\nfuture to make sure your system is secure.\n\n232\n00:12:57.710 --> 00:13:00.020\nI'm not saying never use the SUID bit.\n\n233\n00:13:00.020 --> 00:13:00.800\nIt's got its place.\n\n234\n00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:05.150\nBut anytime it's used,\nyou need to be careful with it.\n\n235\n00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:06.590\nIt is something that's dangerous.\n\n236\n00:13:06.590 --> 00:13:11.330\nIf there's a file, like if I take vi,\nand I flag the vi editor,\n\n237\n00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:15.910\nto have the SUID bit for root,\nthen anybody who uses the vi editor is now\n\n238\n00:13:15.910 --> 00:13:18.930\nusing it as root, they can modify whatever\nthe heck they want on the server.\n\n239\n00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:20.730\nThey could really cause some damage.\n\n240\n00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:23.260\nOr God forbid, I did a shell.\n\n241\n00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:25.610\nCuz then they could pull up that shell and\nhave root access.\n\n242\n00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:28.770\nThat's the kinda danger you\ncan create with the SUID bit.\n\n243\n00:13:28.770 --> 00:13:29.629\n>> So Donald, let me ask you this.\n\n244\n00:13:29.629 --> 00:13:34.235\nSo I suppose that it will all\nkinda depend on whatever security\n\n245\n00:13:34.235 --> 00:13:37.868\npractices are implemented in your company,\nbut\n\n246\n00:13:37.868 --> 00:13:43.731\nhow often would you go in an audit for\nsomething like this, like your systems?\n\n247\n00:13:43.731 --> 00:13:45.878\n>> It really does depend on security.\n\n248\n00:13:45.878 --> 00:13:50.356\nIn a proper environment we\nare implementing change management where\n\n249\n00:13:50.356 --> 00:13:55.470\nchange isn't allowed to a server\nwithout going through proper change.\n\n250\n00:13:55.470 --> 00:13:58.260\nYou would run this every\ntime a change was made.\n\n251\n00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:00.970\nSo any time somebody modified the\nconfiguration of the server you'd repeat\n\n252\n00:14:00.970 --> 00:14:03.120\nyour security audit cuz things changed.\n\n253\n00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:05.206\nBut then having periodic\naudits are useful.\n\n254\n00:14:05.206 --> 00:14:09.622\nYou can never do them too frequently, but\nyou've only got so much time in the day,\n\n255\n00:14:09.622 --> 00:14:13.398\nso if I'm having to do it manually,\nit might be a once a month thing that\n\n256\n00:14:13.398 --> 00:14:16.550\nI actually do this kinda\nscan on a typical system.\n\n257\n00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:20.350\nBut if you can automate it,\nyou can actually write a script.\n\n258\n00:14:20.350 --> 00:14:23.885\nThey could pull the new file,\npull the old file compare the two and\n\n259\n00:14:23.885 --> 00:14:25.436\nemail you the differences.\n\n260\n00:14:25.436 --> 00:14:27.445\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> In that scenario you can run\n\n261\n00:14:27.445 --> 00:14:29.592\nevery single night,\nyou can have it run once an hour.\n\n262\n00:14:29.592 --> 00:14:32.869\nYou can have it run very frequently\nanytime there's was a change with\n\n263\n00:14:32.869 --> 00:14:33.810\nshooting emails.\n\n264\n00:14:33.810 --> 00:14:35.790\nI've seen some setups like\nthat on the Internet.\n\n265\n00:14:35.790 --> 00:14:37.730\nThere's a lot of third party\nsoftware that will do it to itself.\n\n266\n00:14:39.430 --> 00:14:41.810\n>> So\nas far as like auditing the system and\n\n267\n00:14:41.810 --> 00:14:44.538\nthose sorts of things now, when you're\ntrying to change your password,\n\n268\n00:14:44.538 --> 00:14:49.160\nI have password complexity rules and\nthose sorts of things.\n\n269\n00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:53.930\nSo I guess it already has some\ncomplexity rules by default there so\n\n270\n00:14:53.930 --> 00:14:57.820\ndictionary words and too short,\nwe can change those, correct?\n\n271\n00:14:57.820 --> 00:14:58.630\n>> Yeah.\n[LAUGH] So\n\n272\n00:14:58.630 --> 00:15:00.810\nyou guys just saw me\nbump up against that one.\n\n273\n00:15:00.810 --> 00:15:03.480\nI couldn't come up with a password\nthat would make it happy.\n\n274\n00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:06.550\nAnd that was cuz it was\nstopping me from doing it.\n\n275\n00:15:06.550 --> 00:15:12.600\nAnd it has root, if I do passwd dpezet,\nI'm now resetting that password.\n\n276\n00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:16.600\nAnd I can go in here and, well,\nsee it's gonna complain but\n\n277\n00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:18.770\nit will let the user do it anyway.\n\n278\n00:15:18.770 --> 00:15:20.580\nSo now I was able to\napply that simple one.\n\n279\n00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:23.090\nBut the end user,\nthey had that restriction,\n\n280\n00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:24.810\nthey had to pick to a more complex one.\n\n281\n00:15:24.810 --> 00:15:26.640\nIt wouldn't let me get by without it.\n\n282\n00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:31.370\nSo the rule user has a little bit more\npower to get around a stuff like that.\n\n283\n00:15:31.370 --> 00:15:33.742\nBut as far as the limitations go,\n\n284\n00:15:33.742 --> 00:15:39.022\nw e have a command called\nchage which is change age.\n\n285\n00:15:39.022 --> 00:15:43.080\nAnd this is where, originally we just\nused it to change our password ages for\n\n286\n00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:44.130\na user account.\n\n287\n00:15:44.130 --> 00:15:49.060\nBut you can run chage and\nspecify a user like that.\n\n288\n00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:52.163\nAnd see how it's walking\nme through a little wizard.\n\n289\n00:15:52.163 --> 00:15:55.007\nAnd I just pressed enter a bunch of times\nso I can get it higher up on my screen.\n\n290\n00:15:55.007 --> 00:15:59.638\nBut we can come in and we can define what\nwe want the minimum password age to be,\n\n291\n00:15:59.638 --> 00:16:02.660\nthe maximum password age,\nand so on, right.\n\n292\n00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:06.300\nLet me run down these values here, so you\nguys can kinda get an idea of what they do\n\n293\n00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:08.910\nmaximum password age is\nwhat we normally think of.\n\n294\n00:16:08.910 --> 00:16:12.160\nHow often do I want them\nto change their password?\n\n295\n00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:13.160\nIf I set this to 30,\n\n296\n00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:16.680\nthen every 30 days that user will\nhave to change their password.\n\n297\n00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:20.530\nThe minimum age is saying\nonce they change it\n\n298\n00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:23.480\nhow long do they have to wait\nbefore they change it again.\n\n299\n00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:26.150\nYou'll get some users where if you set it,\nso\n\n300\n00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:28.460\nthey can't You can't\nlike reuse a password.\n\n301\n00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:31.790\nThen if you set it to like five passwords,\nit remembers the last five.\n\n302\n00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:34.890\nWell what they'll do is just\nchange the password five times, so\n\n303\n00:16:34.890 --> 00:16:37.750\nit will get to the original,\nby setting the minimum age.\n\n304\n00:16:37.750 --> 00:16:40.130\nIf you set a minimum\nage to like three days.\n\n305\n00:16:40.130 --> 00:16:42.590\nThen to change it five\ntimes to take 15 days,\n\n306\n00:16:42.590 --> 00:16:46.970\nmost people aren't going to do that, so\nyou can set a minimum age if you want to.\n\n307\n00:16:46.970 --> 00:16:52.360\nThe default is zero and 99999, so\neffectively one somebody has a password,\n\n308\n00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:55.870\nthey can then just keep it forever right,\ncuz those are, that's time in days.\n\n309\n00:16:56.890 --> 00:16:59.820\nThe last password change, that's\nshowing when their password was set,\n\n310\n00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:01.330\nI can see mine was set this morning.\n\n311\n00:17:01.330 --> 00:17:03.610\nActually, I just did it a few minutes ago,\ndidn't I?\n\n312\n00:17:03.610 --> 00:17:05.200\nI used the past WD command.\n\n313\n00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:07.190\nSo it's showing that it was changed today.\n\n314\n00:17:07.190 --> 00:17:08.730\nPassword expiration warning.\n\n315\n00:17:08.730 --> 00:17:12.110\nThey'll get a warning seven\ndays prior to it expiring.\n\n316\n00:17:12.110 --> 00:17:13.320\nPassword inactive.\n\n317\n00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:17.270\nAll right, this would mean if\nthe user didn't have a password,\n\n318\n00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:20.080\nor well have inactivity.\n\n319\n00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:23.990\nWhen their password expires,\nthey need to change it, okay.\n\n320\n00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:26.840\nIf they don't log in to change it, so\n\n321\n00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:30.120\nmaybe they just aren't around anymore,\nso they haven't logged in,\n\n322\n00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:35.290\nthis is how long we'll let them stay\ninactive before we lock the account.\n\n323\n00:17:35.290 --> 00:17:37.330\nSo it's not that they\ndon't have a password,\n\n324\n00:17:37.330 --> 00:17:39.020\nit simply don't have a valid password.\n\n325\n00:17:39.020 --> 00:17:41.080\nThat's why I wanted to clarify\nwhat I was saying there.\n\n326\n00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:43.460\nThey have a password,\nit's just already expired.\n\n327\n00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:48.670\nSo we're saying once they expire after x\namounts of days just lock their account.\n\n328\n00:17:48.670 --> 00:17:51.650\nNow they can't even login because we just\nassume they're not coming back at that\n\n329\n00:17:51.650 --> 00:17:52.740\npoint, alright.\n\n330\n00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:55.500\nNow the default is negative one\nwhich means this never happens.\n\n331\n00:17:55.500 --> 00:18:00.410\nBut if you set it to 30, then once their\npassword expires they'll have 30 days to\n\n332\n00:18:00.410 --> 00:18:04.150\nlogin and change it and if they don't\nchange it it'll then be locked, right.\n\n333\n00:18:04.150 --> 00:18:08.730\nWe can lock their account,\nyou can lock it manually using passwd, but\n\n334\n00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:10.120\nit'll lock their account and\n\n335\n00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:13.080\nthen an administrator will have to\nunlock them to be able to get back in.\n\n336\n00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:16.620\nAnd then the account expiration date.\n\n337\n00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:20.090\nLet's say I hire a contractor, and\nthe contract's gonna be doing work.\n\n338\n00:18:20.090 --> 00:18:22.920\nAnd the work is gonna\nbe done on August 1st.\n\n339\n00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:28.080\nWell I might set an expiration date saying\ntheir account expires on August 2nd.\n\n340\n00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:29.920\nAnd that way I don't have\nto remember to do it.\n\n341\n00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:32.160\nOn August 2nd,\ntheir account will stop working and\n\n342\n00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:33.580\nnow they won't be able to login.\n\n343\n00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:37.130\nAnytime you have temporary employees,\nyou should set that expiration date.\n\n344\n00:18:37.130 --> 00:18:40.070\nThat way you're not having to rely\nupon yourself remembering to go and\n\n345\n00:18:40.070 --> 00:18:41.300\ndisable the account and\n\n346\n00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:44.690\nit helps to ensure we don't have\nthese extra accounts dangling around.\n\n347\n00:18:44.690 --> 00:18:49.245\nSo these re all things that we can\nquickly modify using this CH age command.\n\n348\n00:18:49.245 --> 00:18:50.765\nIf you just want to use it to audit,\n\n349\n00:18:50.765 --> 00:18:55.375\nto kind of see what you have now,\nuse the -L modifier.\n\n350\n00:18:55.375 --> 00:18:58.945\nWhen you use that, it'll just show the\ncurrent values, and see how it translates\n\n351\n00:18:58.945 --> 00:19:03.215\nthem from the weird numbers into actual\nwords, like password expires never.\n\n352\n00:19:03.215 --> 00:19:05.055\nPassword inactive never.\n\n353\n00:19:05.055 --> 00:19:07.105\nThose kind of things are in place.\n\n354\n00:19:07.105 --> 00:19:10.785\nIf I leave off the -L,\nthat's where we actually set it.\n\n355\n00:19:10.785 --> 00:19:13.600\nSo maybe I'll set a one day minimum age,\n\n356\n00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:16.100\nso you can only change\nthe password once a day.\n\n357\n00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:20.868\nI'll set a 60 day password age, to say\nyou have to change it every 60 days,\n\n358\n00:19:20.868 --> 00:19:24.134\nI'm not gonna bother with\nthe last password change.\n\n359\n00:19:24.134 --> 00:19:27.704\nI'll leave the expiration\nwarning at seven days, and\n\n360\n00:19:27.704 --> 00:19:32.901\nif a password expires and they don't log\nin for 15 days, if they haven't come\n\n361\n00:19:32.901 --> 00:19:37.810\nto work in two weeks then we'll go ahead\nand drop them and make them locked.\n\n362\n00:19:37.810 --> 00:19:44.414\nAnd then the expiration date maybe I want\nthis account to deactivate on 2014-.\n\n363\n00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:47.030\nWe'll say August 1st.\n\n364\n00:19:50.090 --> 00:19:55.360\nAll right, and then I can audit that,\nand I can see all those values in there.\n\n365\n00:19:55.360 --> 00:20:00.500\nNow it's super handy having this command,\nbecause all of these dates,\n\n366\n00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:04.580\nin the computer it's tracking\nthose not as dates like this, but\n\n367\n00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:09.220\nin the number of days since January 1,\n1970, all right.\n\n368\n00:20:10.630 --> 00:20:12.190\nSo here we are in 2014.\n\n369\n00:20:12.190 --> 00:20:17.790\nThat's 44 years ago that it's tracking\nthe number of days since then.\n\n370\n00:20:17.790 --> 00:20:20.390\nSo if you had to write it that way,\nthis will be a nightmare.\n\n371\n00:20:20.390 --> 00:20:21.440\nBut that's how it's storing it.\n\n372\n00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:23.225\nAnd so when you look inside of like.\n\n373\n00:20:23.225 --> 00:20:28.430\nPasswd.file/etc/passwd, you'll\nsee some of those numbers\n\n374\n00:20:28.430 --> 00:20:33.770\nin there and let's see,\nit's not in here, it's in shadow.\n\n375\n00:20:35.798 --> 00:20:37.544\n/etc/shadow.\n\n376\n00:20:39.444 --> 00:20:41.550\nThere we go.\n\n377\n00:20:41.550 --> 00:20:44.940\nAnd so you'll see these numbers in here\nfor dpezet, and if I look towards the end\n\n378\n00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:50.460\nof it, see these numbers 16,247 that's\nwhen I changed my password last,\n\n379\n00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:54.450\nthat's the amount of days it's\nbeen since January 1st, 1970.\n\n380\n00:20:54.450 --> 00:20:56.960\nIt's been 16,247 days, all right.\n\n381\n00:20:56.960 --> 00:21:02.870\nAnd then I can see I can only\nchange my password once a day.\n\n382\n00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:07.040\nI have a password that expires after\n60 days, I get my warning at seven days\n\n383\n00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:11.100\nif I don't login for 15 after it's\nexpired, I'll get locked, right.\n\n384\n00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:14.828\nAnd then,\nwhat was the last number in that wizard?\n\n385\n00:21:14.828 --> 00:21:18.220\n[LAUGH]\n>> Your lockout date.\n\n386\n00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:19.660\n>> That's right my expiration.\n\n387\n00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:26.620\nSo when it's 16,283 days after January\n1st, 1970, my account will expire.\n\n388\n00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:29.870\nSo that information is being stored, and\nif we had to write it that way, boy it'd\n\n389\n00:21:29.870 --> 00:21:33.230\nbe like break out the calculator, how many\nyears has it been, that's not any fun.\n\n390\n00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:39.010\nAll right, so keep that in mind now one\nthing that might turn up on the exam,\n\n391\n00:21:39.010 --> 00:21:44.150\nwe have the CH age command, but we can\nalso do a lot of this stuff with passwd.\n\n392\n00:21:44.150 --> 00:21:48.760\nPasswd if you look at it's syntax,\nI'm just gonna do a man passwd.\n\n393\n00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:55.860\nYou'll see in here options like, -l to\nlock and -u to unlock, I use those a lot.\n\n394\n00:21:55.860 --> 00:21:58.810\nBut you'll also see in here\nwhere you can set things like\n\n395\n00:21:58.810 --> 00:22:02.870\nthe minimum password lifetime,\nthe maximum password lifetime,\n\n396\n00:22:02.870 --> 00:22:05.090\nyou can set a lot of that stuff,\nall right.\n\n397\n00:22:05.090 --> 00:22:08.460\nThe only thing you can't really do, let's\nsee I think it's password expiration, and\n\n398\n00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:10.980\ndid I put that in my notes,\nyeah you can't do a password expiration.\n\n399\n00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:13.930\nExpiration with passwd, but\nyou can do the rest of it.\n\n400\n00:22:13.930 --> 00:22:19.438\nSo if I wanna do that\nsame basic set up here,\n\n401\n00:22:19.438 --> 00:22:27.285\nI could say passwd -n 1\n-x 60 -i 15 dpezet, okay.\n\n402\n00:22:27.285 --> 00:22:33.775\nThat right there is the same thing that I\ndid up here with CHH, where was that one?\n\n403\n00:22:37.272 --> 00:22:38.102\nI ran through the wizard.\n\n404\n00:22:38.102 --> 00:22:39.468\nI didn't do it in line.\n\n405\n00:22:39.468 --> 00:22:44.044\nSo if I wanted to do that same\nthing with chage it would just be\n\n406\n00:22:44.044 --> 00:22:45.884\nwritten out like this.\n\n407\n00:22:45.884 --> 00:22:52.262\n-m 1 -M 30 -I 15 -E 2014-08-01 dpezet,\nthere.\n\n408\n00:22:52.262 --> 00:23:01.910\nOkay, those two commands\nare almost the same.\n\n409\n00:23:01.910 --> 00:23:05.640\nThe primary difference being this\nexpiration date right here passwd do\n\n410\n00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:06.450\none of those.\n\n411\n00:23:06.450 --> 00:23:08.010\nBut if I left that off,\nthese two are the same.\n\n412\n00:23:08.010 --> 00:23:15.410\nSo we could use passwd or chage expiration\ndate you know or just in chage.\n\n413\n00:23:15.410 --> 00:23:15.910\n>> Yeah.\n\n414\n00:23:17.510 --> 00:23:19.220\nPretty sweet, not a lot to it.\n\n415\n00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:21.300\n>> No, pretty straightforward.\n\n416\n00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:24.319\nSpeaking of things that are straight\nforward, it's not a good segway.\n\n417\n00:23:24.319 --> 00:23:25.720\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But I use it.\n\n418\n00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:28.250\nIn the last episode in networking,\n\n419\n00:23:28.250 --> 00:23:30.768\nI mentioned one thing that we\nmight do is a part of an audit.\n\n420\n00:23:30.768 --> 00:23:32.990\nAnd I said, when you look at your server,\n\n421\n00:23:32.990 --> 00:23:37.050\none thing you need to stand on top of\nit is what's services are we running.\n\n422\n00:23:37.050 --> 00:23:40.510\nSo we can tell if somebody's added or\nnot and secure servers or whatever and\n\n423\n00:23:40.510 --> 00:23:45.560\nin that episode I showed\nthe netstat-atp command, right.\n\n424\n00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:47.450\nThat's one that I like to run,\nnetstat-atp.\n\n425\n00:23:47.450 --> 00:23:53.050\nWhich gives us a list of all the tcp\nlisteners that we've got in place.\n\n426\n00:23:53.050 --> 00:23:57.370\nAnd so I can see on this server for\nexample, that I've got ssh running.\n\n427\n00:23:57.370 --> 00:24:01.063\nI've got the Internet printer\nprotocol running, smtp and I can see,\n\n428\n00:24:01.063 --> 00:24:04.452\nnot just that they're running but\nI can see what launched them.\n\n429\n00:24:04.452 --> 00:24:06.786\nLike cupsd or sshd.\n\n430\n00:24:06.786 --> 00:24:09.978\nSo if somebody brings up\na service on this system,\n\n431\n00:24:09.978 --> 00:24:12.640\nI'll be able to spot that and react to it.\n\n432\n00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:17.200\nAnd I think in that show I did,\nI installed dovecot,\n\n433\n00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:20.690\nwhich was a POP3 and IMAP server.\n\n434\n00:24:20.690 --> 00:24:24.098\nAnd, [LAUGH] am I not, there we go.\n\n435\n00:24:24.098 --> 00:24:30.350\n[COUGH] So I installed that and\nstarted it up, and when I did that.\n\n436\n00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:36.740\nAll right, so I'm just gonna fire that\nup and then ran that netstat -atp.\n\n437\n00:24:36.740 --> 00:24:42.760\nWhen I ran it, I saw that it added a lot\nmore stuff which included pop3 and\n\n438\n00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:46.850\nimap now running on my server and\nI can see it's dovecot that created that.\n\n439\n00:24:46.850 --> 00:24:51.390\nNow, it's also running the secure versions\nof pop3 and imap, so that's good.\n\n440\n00:24:51.390 --> 00:24:53.970\nBut the non secure ones\nare right there and open.\n\n441\n00:24:53.970 --> 00:24:57.120\nSo, doing a netstat lets me see\nthat those ports are there.\n\n442\n00:24:57.120 --> 00:24:59.920\nThe only problem is if\nI've got a 100 servers,\n\n443\n00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:03.550\nI don't wanna have to go to each one and\nrun a netstat to get it.\n\n444\n00:25:03.550 --> 00:25:07.530\nSo, there's actually a handy tool that\nwe can use to scan our servers and\n\n445\n00:25:07.530 --> 00:25:11.490\nfind out what ports are open and\nevaluate what services are there.\n\n446\n00:25:11.490 --> 00:25:13.410\nThe utility is called Nmap.\n\n447\n00:25:13.410 --> 00:25:17.230\nAnd Nmap,\nit's not normally installed by default so\n\n448\n00:25:17.230 --> 00:25:21.370\nyou'll probably have to install it from\nyour repositories but it is open source,\n\n449\n00:25:21.370 --> 00:25:24.320\nit's free, they have it for\nmany operating systems.\n\n450\n00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:25.860\nSo, I'm just gonna install it real quick.\n\n451\n00:25:25.860 --> 00:25:28.840\nI'll do a yum install nmap.\n\n452\n00:25:30.020 --> 00:25:33.280\nAnd there's the package,\nit's not very big, 2.5 megs.\n\n453\n00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:35.560\nSo it's gonna install real quick.\n\n454\n00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:39.994\nAnd what nmap is, is a very advanced\nport scanner and protocol analyzer.\n\n455\n00:25:39.994 --> 00:25:42.492\nSo it's gonna scan my servers and\n\n456\n00:25:42.492 --> 00:25:46.774\ngive me information back as to\nwhat ports are open, and so\n\n457\n00:25:46.774 --> 00:25:51.786\nI can identify services and\nclose things that shouldn't be open.\n\n458\n00:25:51.786 --> 00:25:55.160\nAnd the syntax for\nit is really pretty straightforward.\n\n459\n00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:56.670\nJust do a basic scan.\n\n460\n00:25:56.670 --> 00:25:59.670\nWe say nmap and then a host, okay?\n\n461\n00:25:59.670 --> 00:26:04.170\nIf I want to scan myself,\nI can punch in the IP or the loopback.\n\n462\n00:26:04.170 --> 00:26:07.380\nI can just scan my loopback and\nit will give me that list\n\n463\n00:26:07.380 --> 00:26:10.650\nof stuff that I'm running and\nit's really straightforward.\n\n464\n00:26:10.650 --> 00:26:15.580\nThere's that information, I can see\nI'm running ssh, smtp, pop3, imap,\n\n465\n00:26:15.580 --> 00:26:20.090\nI get the list and now I can turn\naround and secure these if I need to.\n\n466\n00:26:20.090 --> 00:26:22.480\nIf I don't want pop3 and\n\n467\n00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:26.320\nimap, I can either adjust\nthe service not to include those.\n\n468\n00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:30.890\nOr I can turn on a firewall like iptables,\nand block that access, all right?\n\n469\n00:26:30.890 --> 00:26:31.970\nThat's a basic scan.\n\n470\n00:26:31.970 --> 00:26:34.050\nYou can actually do more advanced ones.\n\n471\n00:26:34.050 --> 00:26:35.850\nAnd I just did a single IP, right?\n\n472\n00:26:35.850 --> 00:26:39.490\nI can do a whole network if I wanted,\nour studio network\n\n473\n00:26:40.610 --> 00:26:44.460\nis 10.1.230.0, it's a class C.\n\n474\n00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:49.150\nSo if I write that as 10.1.230.0/24\nthat will actually scan our whole\n\n475\n00:26:49.150 --> 00:26:54.260\nstudio network and look for systems\nthat are out there and ports and stuff.\n\n476\n00:26:54.260 --> 00:26:55.245\nI know Nate's laughing over here.\n\n477\n00:26:55.245 --> 00:26:57.162\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> I'm not gonna run it.\n\n478\n00:26:57.162 --> 00:26:57.827\n>> Don.\n\n479\n00:26:57.827 --> 00:26:58.953\n>> You're waiting for me to hit Enter.\n\n480\n00:26:58.953 --> 00:27:00.161\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n>> I'm not gonna do it.\n\n481\n00:27:00.161 --> 00:27:02.820\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> There's a few other scans we can do.\n\n482\n00:27:02.820 --> 00:27:09.410\nWe can do like -v, which does\na slightly more enhanced port scan.\n\n483\n00:27:09.410 --> 00:27:12.273\nAnd so see how it discovered or\ndid like port, I should have,\n\n484\n00:27:12.273 --> 00:27:13.578\nlet me type that into more.\n\n485\n00:27:17.452 --> 00:27:19.405\nSo it does a little bit\nmore of an enhanced one.\n\n486\n00:27:19.405 --> 00:27:21.885\nSee, I was doing a SYN stealth scan.\n\n487\n00:27:21.885 --> 00:27:22.855\nIt's looking for\n\n488\n00:27:22.855 --> 00:27:26.567\nother ports that it might be able\nto find outside of the normal ones.\n\n489\n00:27:26.567 --> 00:27:27.657\nAnd so it does that scan.\n\n490\n00:27:27.657 --> 00:27:29.397\nAnd it returns back\nanything that it finds,\n\n491\n00:27:29.397 --> 00:27:32.417\nit didn't really find anything else for\nme.\n\n492\n00:27:32.417 --> 00:27:36.337\nWe can tell to try and figure out\nwhat operating system we're running.\n\n493\n00:27:36.337 --> 00:27:40.048\nSo you can go a little bit\nmore advanced with it.\n\n494\n00:27:40.048 --> 00:27:43.588\nSo I'm going to change from that-\nv to like, a dash, let's see,\n\n495\n00:27:43.588 --> 00:27:49.488\nI need -sS and -O, I believe.\n\n496\n00:27:49.488 --> 00:27:51.028\nAnd, we can specify that host, and so\n\n497\n00:27:51.028 --> 00:27:53.428\nnow it's going in to look in there,\nand it's gonna try and find,\n\n498\n00:27:53.428 --> 00:27:57.426\nit's going to try and figure out\nwhat my operating system is, right?\n\n499\n00:27:57.426 --> 00:27:58.058\nSo it's kinda neat,\n\n500\n00:27:58.058 --> 00:28:01.348\nit does the fingerprinting to see\nif it can figure that OS out.\n\n501\n00:28:01.348 --> 00:28:04.040\nAn attacker,\nsomebody breaking into your network,\n\n502\n00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:05.900\nthey're likely going to\nbe using tools like this.\n\n503\n00:28:05.900 --> 00:28:09.230\nThey're trying to learn as much as\nthey can about your operating system\n\n504\n00:28:09.230 --> 00:28:11.450\nto find the appropriate exploits.\n\n505\n00:28:11.450 --> 00:28:12.700\nAnd so here it's going at it.\n\n506\n00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:17.210\nIt found the services like before and it's\ntrying to figure out the operating system.\n\n507\n00:28:17.210 --> 00:28:21.863\nNow my system is a default install,\nwhich is actually pretty secure on CentOS.\n\n508\n00:28:21.863 --> 00:28:26.450\nAnd so you'll see no exact OS matches for\nthe host, and then it goes on to show\n\n509\n00:28:26.450 --> 00:28:31.706\nthe fingerprint that it gotten, and so it\nwasn't able to figure out mine,all right?\n\n510\n00:28:31.706 --> 00:28:36.280\nBut I might try, let me try one\nof our switches or something.\n\n511\n00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:37.743\nSo you go,\nthat's a switch that's on our network.\n\n512\n00:28:37.743 --> 00:28:43.827\nA Cisco switch, and so I'm gonna scan\nit and see what it comes back with.\n\n513\n00:28:43.827 --> 00:28:46.621\n>> Doing those port scans, I guess\nyou're running it against yourself,\n\n514\n00:28:46.621 --> 00:28:48.500\nyou'll have a whole lot out there.\n\n515\n00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:49.786\nYeah, pretty fast.\n\n516\n00:28:49.786 --> 00:28:51.662\nIt's a pretty fast scan.\n\n517\n00:28:51.662 --> 00:28:56.410\nSometimes when I've run this to test\nstuff and take a look at things.\n\n518\n00:28:56.410 --> 00:28:57.950\nIt takes a while.\n\n519\n00:28:57.950 --> 00:28:59.830\nIt just kind of grinds and grinds away.\n\n520\n00:28:59.830 --> 00:29:02.036\n>> Well,\nevery time here I've scanned one host.\n\n521\n00:29:02.036 --> 00:29:04.230\nAnd if you scan one host,\nit's pretty quick.\n\n522\n00:29:04.230 --> 00:29:06.430\nBut normally we'll specify like a subnet.\n\n523\n00:29:06.430 --> 00:29:10.190\nAnd it takes a long time then, cuz it's\nscanning, IP after IP after IP, and\n\n524\n00:29:10.190 --> 00:29:11.680\nit does take a while.\n\n525\n00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:14.370\nThe scan on my switch actually\ncame back with some good data.\n\n526\n00:29:14.370 --> 00:29:16.340\nI can see it's running ssh and\n\n527\n00:29:16.340 --> 00:29:19.780\nhttps, so it's fairly secure,\nthere's no non secure protocols.\n\n528\n00:29:19.780 --> 00:29:22.240\nIt doesn't have Telnet,\nit doesn't have HTTP.\n\n529\n00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:22.800\nSo it's got that.\n\n530\n00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:25.810\nBut it was able to do\na fingerprint on it and\n\n531\n00:29:25.810 --> 00:29:29.654\nI know that it's running Cisco IOS 12.X,\nokay?\n\n532\n00:29:29.654 --> 00:29:33.812\nI don't know exactly which version but\nat least I have a basic idea what OS it's\n\n533\n00:29:33.812 --> 00:29:37.035\nrunning and I can start to\ntarget my attacks appropriately.\n\n534\n00:29:37.035 --> 00:29:40.952\nI mean, I can tailor my\nsecurity audit appropriately.\n\n535\n00:29:40.952 --> 00:29:41.656\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'm gonna\n\n536\n00:29:41.656 --> 00:29:43.465\nuse the right terminology here.\n\n537\n00:29:43.465 --> 00:29:45.557\nAll right, so that is Nmap.\n\n538\n00:29:45.557 --> 00:29:49.670\nNetstat -atp is great if\nyou're sitting at the server.\n\n539\n00:29:49.670 --> 00:29:52.650\nThat's gonna give you the most\naccurate information.\n\n540\n00:29:52.650 --> 00:29:58.330\nNmap is giving you the outside in view,\nnetstat is giving you the inside in view.\n\n541\n00:29:58.330 --> 00:30:01.680\nSo it's already seeing\neverything that it needs to.\n\n542\n00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:04.930\nSo netstat -atp is more accurate.\n\n543\n00:30:04.930 --> 00:30:09.616\nBut if you're scanning a ton of systems,\nyou don't wanna run to each machine\n\n544\n00:30:09.616 --> 00:30:14.246\nto run it, so nmap can give you that\nnice big picture of your entire network.\n\n545\n00:30:14.246 --> 00:30:17.217\nYou can also schedule this to run and\nidentify differences, so\n\n546\n00:30:17.217 --> 00:30:21.110\nyou can see when somebody's brought\nup a new service without approval.\n\n547\n00:30:21.110 --> 00:30:24.577\nSo pretty cool utilities for auditing.\n\n548\n00:30:24.577 --> 00:30:26.260\n>> Yeah and all free.\n\n549\n00:30:26.260 --> 00:30:27.170\n>> Yeah, yeah, free, it's out there.\n\n550\n00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:30.530\nAll right,\nwe've got a few other limits and\n\n551\n00:30:30.530 --> 00:30:34.170\nauditing things that we need to talk about\nbut we're out of time for this segment, so\n\n552\n00:30:34.170 --> 00:30:35.640\nlet's stop here and take a break.\n\n553\n00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:38.327\nWhen we get back,\nmore security auditing after this.\n\n554\n00:30:38.327 --> 00:30:44.828\n[MUSIC]\n\n555\n00:30:44.828 --> 00:30:46.770\nAll right, welcome back everybody.\n\n556\n00:30:46.770 --> 00:30:50.280\nSo the next thing I want to take\na look at is kind of a cool function,\n\n557\n00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:53.300\nit's one that Nate didn't know about,\nwe were talking about during the break.\n\n558\n00:30:53.300 --> 00:30:58.481\nYou know, Unix from day one was designed\nas a mult-user operating system.\n\n559\n00:30:58.481 --> 00:31:00.660\nTake OS's like Dos and\n\n560\n00:31:00.660 --> 00:31:05.250\nWindows, they are really designed around\nthe idea of one person using a computer,\n\n561\n00:31:05.250 --> 00:31:09.570\nso that one person having full access to\nthe whole thing, do whatever they want.\n\n562\n00:31:09.570 --> 00:31:11.630\nWell, in Unix, it's not like that.\n\n563\n00:31:11.630 --> 00:31:14.670\nIt was designed for more than one\nuser accessing the system and\n\n564\n00:31:14.670 --> 00:31:15.990\nhaving restrictions.\n\n565\n00:31:15.990 --> 00:31:19.650\nAnd we saw those restrictions in terms\nof file permissions earlier, and\n\n566\n00:31:19.650 --> 00:31:23.500\nwe were just talking about auditing,\nas far as that SUID bit.\n\n567\n00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:25.660\nWell, there's another thing\nwe need to be aware of,\n\n568\n00:31:25.660 --> 00:31:30.180\nwhich is, a user on your system\ncould start to monopolize resources,\n\n569\n00:31:30.180 --> 00:31:33.790\nmonopolizing the CPU and\nRAM on the system.\n\n570\n00:31:33.790 --> 00:31:35.840\nLogging in multiple times.\n\n571\n00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:39.790\nAnd basically just taking up\nmore resources than they should.\n\n572\n00:31:39.790 --> 00:31:42.140\nSo fortunately with Linux,\nwe can go in and\n\n573\n00:31:42.140 --> 00:31:46.090\ndefine limits to our users and\nput boundaries on them.\n\n574\n00:31:46.090 --> 00:31:48.580\nMuch like we just put limits\non their password policy,\n\n575\n00:31:48.580 --> 00:31:51.220\nwe can do it on their\nresource usage as a whole.\n\n576\n00:31:51.220 --> 00:31:53.860\nAnd there's some really cool\nstuff that you can limit.\n\n577\n00:31:53.860 --> 00:31:57.549\nNow the command that we use for\nlimiting people is ulimit,\n\n578\n00:31:57.549 --> 00:31:59.665\nwhich is our user limit command.\n\n579\n00:31:59.665 --> 00:32:04.688\nAnd it can set limits, I'll tell you,\nI never use it to set limits and\n\n580\n00:32:04.688 --> 00:32:08.930\nthe reason is,\nyou limit those things temporarily.\n\n581\n00:32:08.930 --> 00:32:13.630\nIf I impose a limit with ulimit and\nI reboot, it's all gone again, all right.\n\n582\n00:32:13.630 --> 00:32:15.510\nSo instead when we impose limits,\n\n583\n00:32:15.510 --> 00:32:19.320\nI'll typically use our limit configuration\nfiles, which we'll see in a minute but\n\n584\n00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:24.490\nwhere I do use ulimit is with the -a\noption which is basically an audit.\n\n585\n00:32:24.490 --> 00:32:28.750\nIt lets us see the settings and\nlimits that are in place right now.\n\n586\n00:32:28.750 --> 00:32:32.150\nSo if I do a ulimit -a dpezet,\n\n587\n00:32:32.150 --> 00:32:36.230\nI can see all the limits that\nI have on my user account.\n\n588\n00:32:36.230 --> 00:32:39.500\nSo as I look at this,\nI can see for example file size.\n\n589\n00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:42.370\nI can create files of\nwhatever size I want.\n\n590\n00:32:42.370 --> 00:32:46.790\nAnd max memory size I can consume\nas much memory as I want,\n\n591\n00:32:46.790 --> 00:32:50.400\nI can have up to 1024 file\nopen at a single time.\n\n592\n00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:52.180\nThese are pretty big numbers.\n\n593\n00:32:52.180 --> 00:32:57.050\nCPU time, unlimited, I can have at it,\nI can use whatever I want, okay.\n\n594\n00:32:57.050 --> 00:32:59.450\nAnd then you'll see max user processes,\n\n595\n00:32:59.450 --> 00:33:03.980\nI can run up to 14797\nprograms at once if I want.\n\n596\n00:33:03.980 --> 00:33:06.500\nSo you'll see a lot of stuff in here.\n\n597\n00:33:06.500 --> 00:33:10.700\nThat is, pertaining to\nthe resources I consume as a user.\n\n598\n00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:14.430\nAnd if I want to set these\nlimits I can just say ulimit-.\n\n599\n00:33:16.050 --> 00:33:18.500\nAnd then you just look at\nthe letters right here on ulimit -a.\n\n600\n00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:21.590\nThat's what this is,\nis the key for the settings.\n\n601\n00:33:21.590 --> 00:33:24.270\nAnd so if I want to say Open files,\n\n602\n00:33:24.270 --> 00:33:28.160\nno you can only have 900\nfiles open at once, right.\n\n603\n00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:33.270\nI can just say -n 900 dpezet, okay.\n\n604\n00:33:33.270 --> 00:33:37.280\nSo now the dpezet account can\nonly have 900 files open at once.\n\n605\n00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:40.380\nAnd if I do an audit I can\nsee that that's taken effect.\n\n606\n00:33:40.380 --> 00:33:41.400\nThere it is.\n\n607\n00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:42.170\nAll right.\n\n608\n00:33:42.170 --> 00:33:43.520\nBut word of caution.\n\n609\n00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:46.460\nThe moment I reboot, it all goes away.\n\n610\n00:33:46.460 --> 00:33:48.820\nSo I don't normally set\nlimits like that right here.\n\n611\n00:33:49.860 --> 00:33:52.590\nIf you're an internet service provider and\nyou've got customers and\n\n612\n00:33:52.590 --> 00:33:56.220\nthey're using shared hosting like this,\nyou'll put limits in place to insure that\n\n613\n00:33:56.220 --> 00:33:58.800\none customer can't\nmonopolize the system and\n\n614\n00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:01.120\nwe do it through our\nlimits configuration file.\n\n615\n00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:07.320\nIf you go into /etc/security,\n\n616\n00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:10.280\ninside of there you'll see a number of\ndifferent files and the one that I'm\n\n617\n00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:16.222\nconcerned about is called limits.conf,\nlimits.conf and so I'm gonna add at that.\n\n618\n00:34:16.222 --> 00:34:23.249\nSo I'm just gonna do vi\n/etc/security/limits.conf.\n\n619\n00:34:23.249 --> 00:34:25.100\nAnd here's the file.\n\n620\n00:34:25.100 --> 00:34:27.980\nIt is a heavily documented file\nwhich is awesome cuz it's telling\n\n621\n00:34:27.980 --> 00:34:29.620\nyou exactly what we can do.\n\n622\n00:34:29.620 --> 00:34:33.280\nHere it's telling us how we can specify\nwhat the domain that supplies to.\n\n623\n00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:36.440\nAnd the domain is normally user\nlike I was doing a moment ago, but\n\n624\n00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:40.080\nit can be a group or it can even be a wild\ncard to say that it applies to everybody.\n\n625\n00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:42.630\nSo we can specify some\ndifferent things there.\n\n626\n00:34:42.630 --> 00:34:46.510\nThen we can set whether it's a soft or\nhard limit.\n\n627\n00:34:46.510 --> 00:34:48.630\nA hard limit is going to enforce it.\n\n628\n00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:55.420\nYou can only have 900 files open and\nif you try to open 901 file it stops you.\n\n629\n00:34:55.420 --> 00:34:57.030\nOr it can be a soft limit.\n\n630\n00:34:57.030 --> 00:34:58.380\nWhen you try and open that 900 and\n\n631\n00:34:58.380 --> 00:35:01.360\nfirst file,\nit'll generate a sys log message, right.\n\n632\n00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:05.130\nIt lets you do it, but it generates a log\nmessage that we know to take action.\n\n633\n00:35:05.130 --> 00:35:07.790\nAnd then the last thing,\nis what we're gonna be limiting.\n\n634\n00:35:07.790 --> 00:35:12.260\nAnd you'll see a list, of all\nthe different things that we can limit.\n\n635\n00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:17.290\nAnd so that's where we can specify\nthe file size, memory locks,\n\n636\n00:35:17.290 --> 00:35:22.390\nCPU time,\njust all sorts of stuff maximum processes.\n\n637\n00:35:22.390 --> 00:35:26.210\nSome ones that we didn't see in\nthe command line, max number of logins for\n\n638\n00:35:26.210 --> 00:35:26.980\nthis user.\n\n639\n00:35:26.980 --> 00:35:29.390\nSo number of simultaneous logins.\n\n640\n00:35:29.390 --> 00:35:32.695\nYour priorities, all sorts of different\nstuff here that we can specify.\n\n641\n00:35:32.695 --> 00:35:36.885\nAnd when we put it here\nin our limits.com file,\n\n642\n00:35:36.885 --> 00:35:40.535\nthen even after reboot\nthe limits stays in place.\n\n643\n00:35:40.535 --> 00:35:42.705\nSo if I wanna do,\nwhat did I do a minute ago?\n\n644\n00:35:42.705 --> 00:35:44.375\nWas a number of file, right.\n\n645\n00:35:44.375 --> 00:35:47.660\nSo if I wanna do no file,\nthat's the one I want, so\n\n646\n00:35:47.660 --> 00:35:51.860\nI would come down here, and they give\nyou a few examples, which are nice and\n\n647\n00:35:51.860 --> 00:35:54.430\nI'm gonna come in and\nI'm gonna say, dpezet.\n\n648\n00:35:54.430 --> 00:35:57.130\nNow see how a bunch of these\nhave an @ symbol before them?\n\n649\n00:35:57.130 --> 00:35:59.530\nAn @ symbol means that it's a group.\n\n650\n00:35:59.530 --> 00:36:02.120\nIf we leave that off\nthen it's just a user.\n\n651\n00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:04.930\nCuz remember,\nevery user has a group of the same name.\n\n652\n00:36:04.930 --> 00:36:07.510\nIf you have more than one person doing\nsomething as the group then you'd wanna\n\n653\n00:36:07.510 --> 00:36:10.160\nclassify that all together but\nI'm just going to do the user.\n\n654\n00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:12.810\nAnd I can come in here and\nsay this is a hard limit.\n\n655\n00:36:12.810 --> 00:36:17.830\nA hard limit on number of files and\nI want that limit to be 900, okay.\n\n656\n00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:23.380\nSo now, if I imposed the limit\nwith ulimit a minute ago.\n\n657\n00:36:23.380 --> 00:36:28.730\nBut now if I reboot, it's gonna read the\nlimit from right here and apply, right.\n\n658\n00:36:28.730 --> 00:36:33.520\nSo pretty cool file, if this is your own\nworkstation, this is useless to you.\n\n659\n00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:37.660\nBut if it's a server with shared access\nand many people are in there working it's\n\n660\n00:36:37.660 --> 00:36:44.063\nkind nice to put limits to stop one person\nfrom monopolizing the whole system.\n\n661\n00:36:44.063 --> 00:36:48.260\n>> Hm, mm-hm, that's pretty granular\non how you can specify all that stuff.\n\n662\n00:36:48.260 --> 00:36:49.120\n>> Yeah, it's neat.\n\n663\n00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:51.045\nAnd it does stand from an ISP.\n\n664\n00:36:51.045 --> 00:36:52.680\nBack in the day.\n\n665\n00:36:52.680 --> 00:36:54.695\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So my first internet connection,\n\n666\n00:36:54.695 --> 00:36:56.785\nwhen I signed up for an ISP in 1992.\n\n667\n00:36:56.785 --> 00:36:58.723\n>> It was cans with a string?\n\n668\n00:36:58.723 --> 00:37:00.875\n>> I know.\n[LAUGH] My awesome,\n\n669\n00:37:00.875 --> 00:37:03.375\nI think I had a 1200\nbaud modem at that time.\n\n670\n00:37:03.375 --> 00:37:05.070\nSo this ancient modem.\n\n671\n00:37:05.070 --> 00:37:10.510\nAnd you dialup and you login, and\nthere I was dialing into a Solera server,\n\n672\n00:37:10.510 --> 00:37:12.960\nand so it dropped me into\na shell on a Solera server.\n\n673\n00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:17.050\nAnd so then I'd start doing stuff,\nbrowsing the web, via text web browser and\n\n674\n00:37:17.050 --> 00:37:21.030\nstuff like that FTP, Archie,\nGopher, all those old protocols, so\n\n675\n00:37:21.030 --> 00:37:22.130\nI'd start using those.\n\n676\n00:37:22.130 --> 00:37:24.970\nWell meanwhile there were hundreds of\nother customers doing the same thing.\n\n677\n00:37:24.970 --> 00:37:27.060\nWe all had shells on the same server.\n\n678\n00:37:27.060 --> 00:37:30.570\nAnd so limits like these would stop one\nof us from bogging down the system and\n\n679\n00:37:30.570 --> 00:37:31.309\naffecting all the customers.\n\n680\n00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:35.570\n>> Well since we don't do that anymore.\n\n681\n00:37:35.570 --> 00:37:37.900\nThen can you think of any situations or\n\n682\n00:37:39.270 --> 00:37:43.040\njust scenarios where someone would\nhave to go in and modify this file?\n\n683\n00:37:43.040 --> 00:37:46.100\nOr something to limit\nthe users connecting in?\n\n684\n00:37:46.100 --> 00:37:46.780\n>> Yeah.\nWell you\n\n685\n00:37:46.780 --> 00:37:48.260\nsay we don't use it anymore like this.\n\n686\n00:37:48.260 --> 00:37:49.720\nBut technically we do.\n\n687\n00:37:49.720 --> 00:37:56.610\nIf you take a look as services like\nGmail and Office This 365 Dropbox.\n\n688\n00:37:56.610 --> 00:38:00.900\nSure, we just see a web page, but\nyour authenticating, your logging in,\n\n689\n00:38:00.900 --> 00:38:04.210\nyour running stuff on the back end on\nservers somewhere to access those files,\n\n690\n00:38:04.210 --> 00:38:06.840\nand working stuff, and\nthese limits can apply to that.\n\n691\n00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:08.370\nNow sometimes it's not like that.\n\n692\n00:38:08.370 --> 00:38:10.480\nSometimes you're accessing\na web service and\n\n693\n00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:12.170\nit just calling a database\non the back end.\n\n694\n00:38:12.170 --> 00:38:15.470\nAnd in that case,\nyou're right this stuff is useless, right.\n\n695\n00:38:15.470 --> 00:38:17.930\nBut if you're actually\nauthenticating in a true system,\n\n696\n00:38:17.930 --> 00:38:22.120\nin performing actions in the back end\nthen yeah this coming handy yeah.\n\n697\n00:38:22.120 --> 00:38:23.470\n>> Nice.\n\n698\n00:38:23.470 --> 00:38:25.910\n>> All right.\nSo those are some things\n\n699\n00:38:25.910 --> 00:38:29.850\nnow it's time to talk about a security\ncommand i'm really excited about.\n\n700\n00:38:29.850 --> 00:38:35.180\nEver since episode number one i've started\noff every episode making a mistake.\n\n701\n00:38:35.180 --> 00:38:36.560\nSome of you might have not have noticed.\n\n702\n00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:40.700\nBut any of you that have studied\nsecurity probably noticed it right off.\n\n703\n00:38:40.700 --> 00:38:41.780\nLet me get into my system here,\n\n704\n00:38:41.780 --> 00:38:44.310\ni'll show you my mistake that\nI make every single day.\n\n705\n00:38:44.310 --> 00:38:48.750\nEvery day I get to the log\nin prompt I type in root.\n\n706\n00:38:48.750 --> 00:38:50.380\nAnd I login as root.\n\n707\n00:38:50.380 --> 00:38:54.450\nYou should never, ever, ever login\nas root, and it's been killing me,\n\n708\n00:38:54.450 --> 00:38:56.960\nthis whole show day after day,\nI've been doing this.\n\n709\n00:38:56.960 --> 00:39:00.680\nAnd the reason I've been doing it is\nbecause we were doing a lot of commands\n\n710\n00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:03.020\nthat required elevated privileges.\n\n711\n00:39:03.020 --> 00:39:06.490\nAnd to do that root is\nthe easiest way to get it, so\n\n712\n00:39:06.490 --> 00:39:10.390\nI've been logging in as root, and\nthen running and doing stuff, all right.\n\n713\n00:39:10.390 --> 00:39:11.740\nThat is bad.\n\n714\n00:39:11.740 --> 00:39:17.060\nInstead as an administrator, you should\nhave a regular, run of the mill account.\n\n715\n00:39:17.060 --> 00:39:21.840\nAnd I do, right if I jump over\nto my other TTY, over here,\n\n716\n00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:26.730\nwoops, over here, I'm just logging\nin as dpezet, and password.\n\n717\n00:39:26.730 --> 00:39:27.910\nAnd I'm not a root user.\n\n718\n00:39:27.910 --> 00:39:29.910\nSee that dollar sign on my prompt?\n\n719\n00:39:29.910 --> 00:39:33.200\nI'm just a regular Joe Schmo\nwho can't do much.\n\n720\n00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:36.360\nI can't implement ulimits.\n\n721\n00:39:36.360 --> 00:39:38.970\nIf I try and\nI think I can apply them to myself.\n\n722\n00:39:38.970 --> 00:39:42.290\nBut if I try and\ndo something like ulimit- n 900 root.\n\n723\n00:39:43.470 --> 00:39:44.030\nRight.\n\n724\n00:39:44.030 --> 00:39:46.360\nSo I just tried to apply a limit to root.\n\n725\n00:39:47.770 --> 00:39:51.925\nAnd if I go and look,\ndid it actually just let me do that?\n\n726\n00:39:51.925 --> 00:39:53.660\nIs that an SUID file?\n\n727\n00:39:53.660 --> 00:39:55.334\nNow I'm curious.\n\n728\n00:39:55.334 --> 00:39:56.575\nThat should not have worked.\n\n729\n00:39:56.575 --> 00:40:00.880\n[LAUGH] Maybe I did make myself root or\nsomething.\n\n730\n00:40:01.970 --> 00:40:05.600\nBut anyhow, so normally, we're not gonna\nbe able to perform things like that,\n\n731\n00:40:05.600 --> 00:40:08.120\nI am really surprised\nthat it let me do that.\n\n732\n00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:10.310\nWell, there we go,\nlike I can't reset roots password,\n\n733\n00:40:10.310 --> 00:40:12.380\nonly root can specify a user name.\n\n734\n00:40:12.380 --> 00:40:15.240\nI'm not a root user, so\nI can't do it, I'm limited.\n\n735\n00:40:16.370 --> 00:40:18.450\nBut as a regular admin,\nif you're logging in and\n\n736\n00:40:18.450 --> 00:40:22.100\nyou're checking your email,\nif you're checking disk utilization,\n\n737\n00:40:22.100 --> 00:40:24.410\nstuff like that,\nyou don't need to be an admin for that.\n\n738\n00:40:24.410 --> 00:40:27.630\nSo, what you don't wanna do is you\ndon't wanna send your root username and\n\n739\n00:40:27.630 --> 00:40:30.560\npassword over the network\nany more than you have to.\n\n740\n00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:33.060\nAnd if a hacker's trying\nto break into your system,\n\n741\n00:40:33.060 --> 00:40:34.690\nthey're gonna try to get\nto the root account.\n\n742\n00:40:34.690 --> 00:40:36.230\nThat's gonna be their target.\n\n743\n00:40:36.230 --> 00:40:39.300\nSo, on a lot of systems,\nwe'll disable the root account.\n\n744\n00:40:39.300 --> 00:40:42.020\nWe won't allow you to SSH using the root.\n\n745\n00:40:42.020 --> 00:40:44.300\nWe won't allow you to log in remotely.\n\n746\n00:40:44.300 --> 00:40:48.070\nYou actually have to sit down in front\nof that machine to log in as root.\n\n747\n00:40:48.070 --> 00:40:50.720\nIf you're back at your desk,\nhow do you log in?\n\n748\n00:40:50.720 --> 00:40:53.130\nWell, you get a regular user account.\n\n749\n00:40:53.130 --> 00:40:57.568\nA regular user account like this,\nlike dpezet here, can log in and\n\n750\n00:40:57.568 --> 00:41:01.463\nthen I can use that to perform\nmy administrative actions.\n\n751\n00:41:01.463 --> 00:41:04.017\nNow the problem is, they can't, right?\n\n752\n00:41:04.017 --> 00:41:07.500\nIf I try to reset somebody else's\npassword, right, or if I try and,\n\n753\n00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:09.270\nlet me add a new user, right?\n\n754\n00:41:09.270 --> 00:41:10.880\nSo I'm just gonna add a new user.\n\n755\n00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:15.190\nNo, I can't, I'm not root,\nI'm not an admin, I can't do it.\n\n756\n00:41:15.190 --> 00:41:17.860\nSo there's two solutions to the problem.\n\n757\n00:41:17.860 --> 00:41:21.300\nThe first solution is the su command,\nthe su command or\n\n758\n00:41:21.300 --> 00:41:26.580\nsuper user It allows you to\nimpersonate another user, all right.\n\n759\n00:41:26.580 --> 00:41:31.380\nYou can impersonate root if you want,\nor you can impersonate other users,\n\n760\n00:41:31.380 --> 00:41:32.930\nand the default is root.\n\n761\n00:41:32.930 --> 00:41:37.760\nIf I just run su, it's gonna ask me for\nthe password for my root account.\n\n762\n00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:42.990\nAnd if I know it I can punch it in and\nnow i'm running as root, okay.\n\n763\n00:41:42.990 --> 00:41:45.960\nSo I logged in as my regular user,\nso when I SSHed or\n\n764\n00:41:45.960 --> 00:41:48.110\nwhatever I just came in as\nregular Joe Schmoe user.\n\n765\n00:41:49.300 --> 00:41:52.718\nAnd now I run SU and\ni've switched over to root, all right.\n\n766\n00:41:52.718 --> 00:41:57.980\nNow, i'm running things and\nif I do a whoami, it shows that I am root.\n\n767\n00:41:57.980 --> 00:41:59.800\nI'm running things as root.\n\n768\n00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:00.370\nAll right.\n\n769\n00:42:00.370 --> 00:42:04.300\nAnd now I can go through and\nI can say useradd bsmith.\n\n770\n00:42:04.300 --> 00:42:06.530\nAll right.\nAnd they already exist.\n\n771\n00:42:06.530 --> 00:42:11.600\nAnd I can say passwd bsmith,\nand reset their password.\n\n772\n00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:13.450\nAnd so I'll just punch that in.\n\n773\n00:42:13.450 --> 00:42:14.840\nAnd I can assign it.\n\n774\n00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:19.100\nVersus if I type exit,\nnow I'm back to being dpezet.\n\n775\n00:42:19.100 --> 00:42:24.560\nAnd if I do a passwd bsmith,\nonly root can do it, I'm not root.\n\n776\n00:42:25.850 --> 00:42:29.440\nThat's one solution, but\neven this is not a good solution.\n\n777\n00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:33.600\nAnd the reason is once I do su,\nit's easy to forget about it, right?\n\n778\n00:42:33.600 --> 00:42:38.910\nSo I do su, I become root, and now I'm\ndoing stuff and I start checking my mail.\n\n779\n00:42:38.910 --> 00:42:41.970\nI start doing other things like that,\nnon-administrative tasks.\n\n780\n00:42:41.970 --> 00:42:44.877\nI walk away, and I go to the water\ncooler and I get a drink, and\n\n781\n00:42:44.877 --> 00:42:47.970\nsomebody walks up to my machine\nthat I forgot and left unlocked.\n\n782\n00:42:47.970 --> 00:42:50.491\nAnd they're like, root access,\nand they start doing things,\n\n783\n00:42:50.491 --> 00:42:53.401\nthey can whip up an account for themselves\nreal quick and clear the history, and\n\n784\n00:42:53.401 --> 00:42:55.250\nI won't even know what happened.\n\n785\n00:42:55.250 --> 00:42:55.770\nOkay.\n\n786\n00:42:55.770 --> 00:42:58.980\nSo, we don't even want to use su\nif we can avoid it, all right.\n\n787\n00:42:58.980 --> 00:43:03.990\nIt is kinda handy though because\nyou can say like su bsmith and\n\n788\n00:43:03.990 --> 00:43:07.150\nas root I just became Bob Smith.\n\n789\n00:43:07.150 --> 00:43:11.990\nAnd now I can see the system from their\nperspective and fix a problem or whatever.\n\n790\n00:43:11.990 --> 00:43:15.090\nAnd I can type exit and\nnow I'm back to root again.\n\n791\n00:43:15.090 --> 00:43:16.400\nAnd I was actually three levels deep.\n\n792\n00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:19.830\nIt's like that, what was that dream\nmovie with Leonardo DeCrappio?\n\n793\n00:43:19.830 --> 00:43:21.080\n>> Inception.\n\n794\n00:43:21.080 --> 00:43:22.058\n>> Inception?\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n795\n00:43:22.058 --> 00:43:23.960\n>> Okay, so it's like that movie, right?\n\n796\n00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:25.340\nSo I'm going deeper,\nand deeper, and deeper.\n\n797\n00:43:25.340 --> 00:43:28.930\nI I was dpezet, then I became root,\nthen I became Bob Smith.\n\n798\n00:43:28.930 --> 00:43:30.800\nAnd at the end of the day,\n\n799\n00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:35.860\nif I exit enough, I'll get to where I am,\nthere we go dpezet.\n\n800\n00:43:35.860 --> 00:43:40.150\nSo, it's pretty cool that you can\ndo it and it does have its uses.\n\n801\n00:43:40.150 --> 00:43:42.270\nBut it's still a security risk.\n\n802\n00:43:42.270 --> 00:43:45.020\nCuz if you leave yourself logged in,\nif you forget that you're logged in with\n\n803\n00:43:45.020 --> 00:43:48.950\nthose elevated privileges,\nit stays like that for the whole session.\n\n804\n00:43:48.950 --> 00:43:50.730\nAnd it does open you up.\n\n805\n00:43:50.730 --> 00:43:54.320\nSo the command that I've really wanted to\nuse, the command that I wanted to use on\n\n806\n00:43:54.320 --> 00:43:59.060\nday one of this show but I've been holding\noff of, is the Sudo command, all right.\n\n807\n00:43:59.060 --> 00:44:01.050\nSudo, S-U-D-O.\n\n808\n00:44:01.050 --> 00:44:03.330\nOr you'll hear a lot of\npeople call it su do,\n\n809\n00:44:03.330 --> 00:44:06.490\nwhich is I believe the right way\nI just don't like to say it.\n\n810\n00:44:06.490 --> 00:44:09.430\nBasically it's S-U do.\n\n811\n00:44:09.430 --> 00:44:13.610\nSo, do something as the super user,\nsuper user do.\n\n812\n00:44:13.610 --> 00:44:15.159\nDo an activity under\nthat other permission.\n\n813\n00:44:15.159 --> 00:44:17.028\nSo sudo, I like to say sudo.\n\n814\n00:44:17.028 --> 00:44:19.010\n[LAUGH] Whatever.\n\n815\n00:44:19.010 --> 00:44:26.340\nSo, what sudo does, is it basically\nlets us run one command, as su as root.\n\n816\n00:44:26.340 --> 00:44:28.620\nAnd then,\nwe're back to just being us again.\n\n817\n00:44:28.620 --> 00:44:32.470\nAnd so that way we don't forget,\nwe don't leave ourselves in there.\n\n818\n00:44:32.470 --> 00:44:34.830\nWe just run that one\ncommand as somebody else.\n\n819\n00:44:34.830 --> 00:44:38.930\nSo like i'm dpezet and\nlet's say I want to do a yum update.\n\n820\n00:44:38.930 --> 00:44:40.470\nI wanna update my server.\n\n821\n00:44:40.470 --> 00:44:43.430\nWell, you need to be root to perform it,\nokay?\n\n822\n00:44:43.430 --> 00:44:48.367\nWhat I could do is instead I could\nsay sudo or sudo yum update.\n\n823\n00:44:48.367 --> 00:44:49.480\nAll right?\n\n824\n00:44:49.480 --> 00:44:51.740\nAnd when I run that, it will run as route.\n\n825\n00:44:51.740 --> 00:44:55.090\nNow, there is gonna be a slight\nlittle problem which is,\n\n826\n00:44:55.090 --> 00:45:00.190\nI'm trying to run sudo and\nI'm just a regular user.\n\n827\n00:45:00.190 --> 00:45:05.370\nSo, if I'm a regular user, it's gonna saw,\nwell, first off, we provide your password.\n\n828\n00:45:05.370 --> 00:45:07.970\nWe need to make sure that\nyou are who you say you are.\n\n829\n00:45:07.970 --> 00:45:08.520\nAll right.\n\n830\n00:45:08.520 --> 00:45:10.360\nSo I got to reprovide my password.\n\n831\n00:45:10.360 --> 00:45:12.340\nSo in this way,\nif I walked away from my machine and\n\n832\n00:45:12.340 --> 00:45:14.770\nsomebody else came up, they'd hit this.\n\n833\n00:45:14.770 --> 00:45:18.780\nAnd then secondly, I have to be\nauthorized to run sudo, which I'm not.\n\n834\n00:45:18.780 --> 00:45:23.070\nAnd so, I get an error,\ndpezet is not in the sudoers file.\n\n835\n00:45:23.070 --> 00:45:27.780\nThere's a file that dictates who's allowed\nto use this command, and I'm not in it.\n\n836\n00:45:27.780 --> 00:45:28.650\nOkay.\n\n837\n00:45:28.650 --> 00:45:30.790\nSo, it's not gonna work for me.\n\n838\n00:45:30.790 --> 00:45:34.820\nBut the cool part here is, if it did work,\nI punch in my password and\n\n839\n00:45:34.820 --> 00:45:37.550\nit caches that for five minutes, and for\n\n840\n00:45:37.550 --> 00:45:42.230\nthe next five minutes I can use the pseudo\ncommand to run whatever I need as root.\n\n841\n00:45:42.230 --> 00:45:45.930\nAnd then after five minutes, it's gonna\nask me for my password agin, all right?\n\n842\n00:45:45.930 --> 00:45:49.630\nSo the cool thing there is I\ncan run the commands I need and\n\n843\n00:45:49.630 --> 00:45:52.730\nthen I can go back to just\nbeing normal average Joe, and\n\n844\n00:45:52.730 --> 00:45:55.930\nif I walk away,\nI'm just normal average Joe now.\n\n845\n00:45:55.930 --> 00:45:57.980\nSomebody could walk up and yeah,\nthey'd have my account, but\n\n846\n00:45:57.980 --> 00:46:00.190\nthey wouldn't be able to do anything\nbecause I'm just a regular user.\n\n847\n00:46:01.210 --> 00:46:02.760\nSo let's fix this file part.\n\n848\n00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:06.697\nI'm not in the sudoers file, so\nI need to get in there, or sudoers, sudo,\n\n849\n00:46:06.697 --> 00:46:08.833\nlike I still like to say it the right way.\n\n850\n00:46:08.833 --> 00:46:10.630\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So if we wanna add it that,\n\n851\n00:46:10.630 --> 00:46:12.620\nthat's a few ways to go about it.\n\n852\n00:46:12.620 --> 00:46:15.870\nIt is actually just a file.\n\n853\n00:46:15.870 --> 00:46:18.640\nYou can browse and find it,\n\n854\n00:46:18.640 --> 00:46:24.480\nit's in /etc like most things and\nso if we look you'll see out there.\n\n855\n00:46:24.480 --> 00:46:26.820\nThere you go.\n\n856\n00:46:26.820 --> 00:46:32.420\nSudoers / etc / sudoers, you can go in and\nyou can just modify it directly.\n\n857\n00:46:32.420 --> 00:46:35.480\nThe syntax and\nthe file's a little bit funky though so\n\n858\n00:46:35.480 --> 00:46:39.290\nthere is actually a command for\nus called visudo.\n\n859\n00:46:39.290 --> 00:46:44.260\nAnd so we can say, visudo like that and\nthat'll take us in to a special- and\n\n860\n00:46:44.260 --> 00:46:48.350\nit's still vi, but it'll take us into\na special instance of sudo that,\n\n861\n00:46:48.350 --> 00:46:52.290\non a color terminal you'll actually\nsee it, it does syntax correction and\n\n862\n00:46:52.290 --> 00:46:55.220\nmakes everything look pretty\nas you go through and edit it.\n\n863\n00:46:55.220 --> 00:46:58.580\nI forgot, I've got my colors turned off so\nit doesn't matter.\n\n864\n00:46:58.580 --> 00:47:03.760\nSo anyhow, either way, if I just did\nbuy/stc/tutors or if I did it this\n\n865\n00:47:03.760 --> 00:47:09.770\nway using vice tutor or vice hudo,\nthen it would take me right here.\n\n866\n00:47:09.770 --> 00:47:13.560\nNow this file is another one that's\nheavily commented and what it does is it\n\n867\n00:47:13.560 --> 00:47:19.000\nbasically tells you how you can use this\nto restrict the access that people have.\n\n868\n00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:22.240\nIt can be very simple or\nit can be very complex.\n\n869\n00:47:22.240 --> 00:47:27.190\nFor example, if I wanna allow dpezet,\nis that to use the sudo command.\n\n870\n00:47:27.190 --> 00:47:32.210\nThe easiest way to do that is\nto come in here and add in.\n\n871\n00:47:32.210 --> 00:47:37.256\nI'm just gonna come in here and\nI'm gonna say dpezet\n\n872\n00:47:37.256 --> 00:47:42.249\nALL=(ALL), like that.\n\n873\n00:47:42.249 --> 00:47:48.189\nOkay, what I'm saying here,\nwhat this command basically says\n\n874\n00:47:48.189 --> 00:47:54.240\nis the user dpezet can log in from\nall systems, any work station.\n\n875\n00:47:54.240 --> 00:47:59.790\nAnd when they log in, they can run\nany command they want, using sudo.\n\n876\n00:47:59.790 --> 00:48:00.800\nAll right.\n\n877\n00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:04.890\nSo they've got that ability to be able to\nrun whatever they want from any machine.\n\n878\n00:48:05.990 --> 00:48:07.740\nI can put limits on this.\n\n879\n00:48:07.740 --> 00:48:12.430\nI can say dpezet,\ndp dash Linux equals whatever now.\n\n880\n00:48:12.430 --> 00:48:15.910\nThey can run sudo if they're\nsitting at this machine.\n\n881\n00:48:15.910 --> 00:48:19.370\nIf they're on, cuz my machine\nis called dpezet or dp- Linux.\n\n882\n00:48:19.370 --> 00:48:23.880\nOr I can do a list, a comma separated list\nof machines saying if they're on any of\n\n883\n00:48:23.880 --> 00:48:28.060\nthese five machines then yes,\nthey can use sudo, all right?\n\n884\n00:48:28.060 --> 00:48:29.990\nAnd then instead of all,\n\n885\n00:48:29.990 --> 00:48:33.970\nI can actually list out the commands\nthat I want them to be run.\n\n886\n00:48:33.970 --> 00:48:37.020\nAnd so you see a great example down here.\n\n887\n00:48:37.020 --> 00:48:40.130\nYou might have tech support guys, right?\n\n888\n00:48:40.130 --> 00:48:43.500\nThat are, maybe they're not high\nlevel admins in your system,\n\n889\n00:48:43.500 --> 00:48:47.450\nmaybe they're just entry-level\ntech support people.\n\n890\n00:48:47.450 --> 00:48:50.060\nSo maybe we have a tech support group.\n\n891\n00:48:50.060 --> 00:48:50.980\nAll right.\nIn a group,\n\n892\n00:48:50.980 --> 00:48:52.560\nI'd want to stick percent\nat the beginning so\n\n893\n00:48:52.560 --> 00:48:54.225\nit knows I'm talking about a group and\nnot a user.\n\n894\n00:48:54.225 --> 00:48:59.290\nAnd so that group, I might want to say,\nwhen they log in, they can log in from any\n\n895\n00:48:59.290 --> 00:49:05.660\nmachine, and when they log in, I want them\nto be able to mount and unmount CD disks.\n\n896\n00:49:05.660 --> 00:49:07.960\nRight, so\nthey can do whatever it is they do.\n\n897\n00:49:07.960 --> 00:49:13.115\nSo, I can give them /sbin/mount/cdrom.\n\n898\n00:49:14.410 --> 00:49:18.350\nThat saying they get access to\nthe mount command but not only that,\n\n899\n00:49:18.350 --> 00:49:22.315\nthey get access to mount, but\nthey can only mount it to /mount/cdrom.\n\n900\n00:49:22.315 --> 00:49:24.735\nThat one folder, so\nI'm not just letting them mount anywhere,\n\n901\n00:49:24.735 --> 00:49:26.785\nthey can only mount it\nto that one direction.\n\n902\n00:49:26.785 --> 00:49:32.088\nAnd I can then come in and\nspecify the umount for the same thing.\n\n903\n00:49:32.088 --> 00:49:34.910\nUmount, or mnt/cdrom.\n\n904\n00:49:34.910 --> 00:49:38.250\nSo now they can mount\na CD to that folder and\n\n905\n00:49:38.250 --> 00:49:40.050\nthey can unmount a CD from that folder.\n\n906\n00:49:41.240 --> 00:49:45.750\nYou need to be root in order to mount and\nunmount file systems.\n\n907\n00:49:45.750 --> 00:49:51.400\nAnd this is saying these guys will be\nallowed to use sudo to mount the cd And\n\n908\n00:49:51.400 --> 00:49:53.360\nunmount the CD and that's it.\n\n909\n00:49:53.360 --> 00:49:55.070\nThat's very, very restrictive.\n\n910\n00:49:55.070 --> 00:49:57.880\nWe're giving them just\nthose specific commands.\n\n911\n00:49:57.880 --> 00:50:01.860\nThat's the power of sudo,\nand that's why su is so bad.\n\n912\n00:50:01.860 --> 00:50:06.650\nWith su, you're getting a shell for\nthe root user.\n\n913\n00:50:06.650 --> 00:50:09.280\nAnd once you've got that shell you\ncan do whatever the heck you want.\n\n914\n00:50:09.280 --> 00:50:11.360\nYou can do all sorts of damage, right?\n\n915\n00:50:11.360 --> 00:50:15.200\nBut here we can limit it to very,\nvery specific commands so\n\n916\n00:50:15.200 --> 00:50:20.020\nthey can just do those,\nthat's the power of this program, right?\n\n917\n00:50:20.020 --> 00:50:23.206\nNow one thing I do hate is they've\ngot this option right here,\n\n918\n00:50:23.206 --> 00:50:26.600\nNOPASSWD: ALL, all right?\n\n919\n00:50:26.600 --> 00:50:31.570\nWhen somebody runs sudo,\nthe default is to have an all there,\n\n920\n00:50:31.570 --> 00:50:37.570\nwhich I actually just left off which is,\nto prompt them for their own password.\n\n921\n00:50:37.570 --> 00:50:40.700\nSo that if they walked away from\nthe computer and somebody came up and\n\n922\n00:50:40.700 --> 00:50:43.880\nfound their session logged in and\ntries to do sudo commands, right?\n\n923\n00:50:43.880 --> 00:50:46.060\nThat it's gonna prompt them for\nthe password again.\n\n924\n00:50:46.060 --> 00:50:51.940\nIf you do NOPASSWD: ALL, that says don't\nask them for their password again.\n\n925\n00:50:51.940 --> 00:50:54.130\nIf they're already in there,\njust let them use sudo and\n\n926\n00:50:54.130 --> 00:50:57.370\ndon't require them to punch in a password,\nI do not like that.\n\n927\n00:50:57.370 --> 00:50:59.360\nThat's not a great option.\n\n928\n00:50:59.360 --> 00:51:03.774\nSo they do have that support, but\nI really don't recommend using it.\n\n929\n00:51:03.774 --> 00:51:09.180\nNow the sudo command actually\ncame from the OpenBSD world.\n\n930\n00:51:09.180 --> 00:51:12.170\nAnd over there they have\na group called wheel.\n\n931\n00:51:12.170 --> 00:51:14.760\nAnd if you want somebody\nto be able to use sudo,\n\n932\n00:51:14.760 --> 00:51:16.600\nyou just stick them in the wheel group.\n\n933\n00:51:16.600 --> 00:51:20.170\nSo here in Linux we have that group,\nbut you don't have to use it.\n\n934\n00:51:20.170 --> 00:51:22.890\nIt's just there for compatibility\nbecause that's how it was developed.\n\n935\n00:51:22.890 --> 00:51:26.090\nSo you'll see %wheel in\na lot of the examples, and\n\n936\n00:51:26.090 --> 00:51:29.030\nif you want, you can use it,\nbut I usually just ignore it.\n\n937\n00:51:29.030 --> 00:51:32.770\nAnd so you create your own admin group or\nwhatever, and you put people in it, or\n\n938\n00:51:32.770 --> 00:51:34.090\nyou can just use wheel.\n\n939\n00:51:34.090 --> 00:51:40.170\nAll right, so as this is written, dpezet\nwill now be able to run from any machine.\n\n940\n00:51:42.030 --> 00:51:44.360\nFrom any machine, doesn't mean we'll\nbe able to run this on every machine.\n\n941\n00:51:44.360 --> 00:51:47.500\nThey can come from any machine and\nconnect to this one.\n\n942\n00:51:47.500 --> 00:51:52.000\nAnd on this machine, they'll be able\nto run any command, using sudo,\n\n943\n00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:53.830\nif they provide their password.\n\n944\n00:51:53.830 --> 00:51:55.090\nPassword for all commands.\n\n945\n00:51:55.090 --> 00:51:55.720\nRight.\n\n946\n00:51:55.720 --> 00:51:58.540\nAnd down here I listed\nthese commands separately.\n\n947\n00:51:58.540 --> 00:52:01.190\nYou can create aliases,\nwhich you'll see these aliases up here.\n\n948\n00:52:01.190 --> 00:52:05.110\nWhere they're coming through and,\nwell some are up here, like here.\n\n949\n00:52:05.110 --> 00:52:07.590\nHere they created an alias for delegating.\n\n950\n00:52:07.590 --> 00:52:10.830\nAnd then they list a bunch of commands for\nthat alias.\n\n951\n00:52:10.830 --> 00:52:13.710\nAnd so down there, when I list my\ncommands, I could put an alias in there,\n\n952\n00:52:13.710 --> 00:52:17.930\nso like, here, they have storage,\nand it includes mount and umount.\n\n953\n00:52:17.930 --> 00:52:20.660\nAnd so if I had given them storage, they\nwould have that, but they would also have\n\n954\n00:52:20.660 --> 00:52:24.510\nfdisk, sfdisk, parted, those ones that\nI might not want them to have but\n\n955\n00:52:24.510 --> 00:52:27.820\nyou can create your own aliases too,\nincredibly powerful software.\n\n956\n00:52:27.820 --> 00:52:31.860\nAll right, I'm gonna go ahead and\nsave this all right.\n\n957\n00:52:31.860 --> 00:52:36.720\nAnd now that it's saved, I'm gonna jump\nback over to where I'm good old dpezet and\n\n958\n00:52:36.720 --> 00:52:39.210\nI'm gonna run sudo ls.\n\n959\n00:52:39.210 --> 00:52:43.240\nI'm just gonna pull up\na directory listing as root.\n\n960\n00:52:43.240 --> 00:52:46.560\nIt's prompting me for\nmy password cuz we left that option on.\n\n961\n00:52:46.560 --> 00:52:48.920\nAnd I'll run it and there it goes.\n\n962\n00:52:48.920 --> 00:52:52.620\nNow, I'm saying a directory as root.\n\n963\n00:52:52.620 --> 00:52:55.730\nAll right, and\nif I do another sudo command,\n\n964\n00:52:55.730 --> 00:53:00.430\nsee how it didn't ask me for\nmy password, it's cache for minutes.\n\n965\n00:53:00.430 --> 00:53:02.160\nI've got 5 minutes now to use this.\n\n966\n00:53:02.160 --> 00:53:04.790\nAnd then after 5 minutes it's gonna\nask me for my password again.\n\n967\n00:53:04.790 --> 00:53:06.150\nAll right.\nIf we idle out.\n\n968\n00:53:06.150 --> 00:53:08.570\nIf you keep running it,\nit actually keeps extending it.\n\n969\n00:53:08.570 --> 00:53:12.750\nSo now, if I wanna do sudo yum update,\n\n970\n00:53:12.750 --> 00:53:15.900\nthat failed a moment ago,\nbut now I can run it.\n\n971\n00:53:15.900 --> 00:53:19.440\nNow, I'm running this one command as root.\n\n972\n00:53:19.440 --> 00:53:23.920\nAnd when it's done, I'll be back to\njust my regular old user account.\n\n973\n00:53:23.920 --> 00:53:31.340\nSo right now, if I were to jump over\nto another terminal, all right.\n\n974\n00:53:31.340 --> 00:53:35.800\nAnd I'm gonna do a sudo ps aux,\nit's prompting me for my password,\n\n975\n00:53:35.800 --> 00:53:37.340\nbecause I'm in another session over here.\n\n976\n00:53:37.340 --> 00:53:41.525\nAnd when I go into this,\nI can see right here,\n\n977\n00:53:41.525 --> 00:53:45.302\nlet me move this up on\nmy screen sorry guys.\n\n978\n00:53:45.302 --> 00:53:48.838\nI can see right here sudo yum update,\nthat process running and\n\n979\n00:53:48.838 --> 00:53:53.350\nlook over here who's running it,\nit's not dpezet, it's root.\n\n980\n00:53:53.350 --> 00:53:55.410\nRight, it's running as root.\n\n981\n00:53:55.410 --> 00:53:57.980\nAnd so that's pretty cool that it's there.\n\n982\n00:54:00.120 --> 00:54:04.910\nAnd if I go back to my other session,\nI'm gonna say no to that, and\n\n983\n00:54:04.910 --> 00:54:08.720\nwhen it's done,\nI'm just back to being good old DPezet.\n\n984\n00:54:08.720 --> 00:54:11.200\nIf I do a sudo whoami.\n\n985\n00:54:11.200 --> 00:54:12.880\nSee what it says, I am root.\n\n986\n00:54:12.880 --> 00:54:15.740\nBut if I do a whoami, I'm just dpezet.\n\n987\n00:54:15.740 --> 00:54:16.260\nAll right?\n\n988\n00:54:16.260 --> 00:54:20.300\nSo you can run one command at a time,\nas root, making sure you don't forget it.\n\n989\n00:54:20.300 --> 00:54:21.620\nThis is the best way to do it.\n\n990\n00:54:21.620 --> 00:54:24.010\nThis is the way that I\ndo it in real life land.\n\n991\n00:54:24.010 --> 00:54:27.770\nI never login as root, and\nI never use the su command.\n\n992\n00:54:27.770 --> 00:54:29.220\nWell, that's not entirely true.\n\n993\n00:54:29.220 --> 00:54:31.170\nI use the su command once.\n\n994\n00:54:31.170 --> 00:54:34.480\nBecause I need to, to configure sudo.\n\n995\n00:54:34.480 --> 00:54:40.070\nSo that's the time that I run via sudo and\nget that set up and the come back.\n\n996\n00:54:40.070 --> 00:54:40.740\nAnd I never have to do it again.\n\n997\n00:54:40.740 --> 00:54:45.440\nSo sudo is the command that we use for\n\n998\n00:54:45.440 --> 00:54:48.580\nrunning these things.\n\n999\n00:54:48.580 --> 00:54:51.650\nSo I feel like I had a different\nexample I wanted to show.\n\n1000\n00:54:51.650 --> 00:54:55.054\nBut let just check my notes real quick,\nmake sure I didn't miss anything.\n\n1001\n00:54:55.054 --> 00:54:56.620\nUbuntu, all right.\n\n1002\n00:54:56.620 --> 00:54:58.920\nI'm not a big fan of Ubuntu but\n\n1003\n00:54:58.920 --> 00:55:01.620\nthere are some things they\ndo that are a little easier.\n\n1004\n00:55:01.620 --> 00:55:06.120\nIn Ubuntu, it actually ships\nwith a group called sudo.\n\n1005\n00:55:06.120 --> 00:55:07.880\nSo that group already exists.\n\n1006\n00:55:07.880 --> 00:55:10.930\nI think it's group ID 20 something.\n\n1007\n00:55:10.930 --> 00:55:12.060\nThe ID doesn't matter.\n\n1008\n00:55:12.060 --> 00:55:13.790\nSo it's just called sudo.\n\n1009\n00:55:13.790 --> 00:55:16.550\nAnd you can just add that as\na secondary group to somebody.\n\n1010\n00:55:16.550 --> 00:55:18.110\nAnd then that gives them that access.\n\n1011\n00:55:18.110 --> 00:55:20.190\nBut Red Hat, CentOS, they don't do that.\n\n1012\n00:55:20.190 --> 00:55:24.470\nYou actually have to go in and\nattach the groups to the sudoers file.\n\n1013\n00:55:24.470 --> 00:55:26.390\nI think that is about it, yeah.\n\n1014\n00:55:26.390 --> 00:55:29.819\nSo that's it for\nthat command and from then on,\n\n1015\n00:55:29.819 --> 00:55:33.946\nI just login as regular old dpezet and\nI use that command.\n\n1016\n00:55:33.946 --> 00:55:38.662\n>> Pretty sweet conditionally\nset when somebody can use it and\n\n1017\n00:55:38.662 --> 00:55:41.820\nthen I guess down as granular.\n\n1018\n00:55:41.820 --> 00:55:45.350\nWho can do what with that as well.\n\n1019\n00:55:45.350 --> 00:55:46.010\n>> Yeah, pretty much.\n\n1020\n00:55:46.010 --> 00:55:47.360\n>> Well one word of caution.\n\n1021\n00:55:47.360 --> 00:55:50.470\nAn enterprising user might try to\ndo something tricky like this.\n\n1022\n00:55:50.470 --> 00:55:52.696\nRemember, if you have access to sudo and\n\n1023\n00:55:52.696 --> 00:55:55.121\nyou've got it set to\nall commands like I do.\n\n1024\n00:55:55.121 --> 00:55:59.771\nWhat happens if I do Sudo/bin/bash.\n\n1025\n00:55:59.771 --> 00:56:04.977\nRight, well I just ran a shell as root,\nand so now I am in a shell,\n\n1026\n00:56:04.977 --> 00:56:09.040\nand I can sit here and\nI can run multiple commands.\n\n1027\n00:56:09.040 --> 00:56:12.060\nAnd I can walk away from my desk and\nit's still there.\n\n1028\n00:56:12.060 --> 00:56:14.610\nAll right, so\nif you just give somebody all,\n\n1029\n00:56:14.610 --> 00:56:17.820\nyou still have that risk of them\ncreating a shell as root and\n\n1030\n00:56:17.820 --> 00:56:20.270\nleaving themselves logged in and\nleaving yourself at risk.\n\n1031\n00:56:20.270 --> 00:56:22.830\nThat's why it's so important to\ncreate those command aliases, and\n\n1032\n00:56:22.830 --> 00:56:25.800\njust give people\nthe commands they need and\n\n1033\n00:56:25.800 --> 00:56:29.008\nonly give them all if you know\nthey're not complete idiots.\n\n1034\n00:56:29.008 --> 00:56:31.560\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And unfortunately in the It industry,\n\n1035\n00:56:31.560 --> 00:56:33.900\ncan be hard to tell whether\nsomebody's a complete idiot or not,\n\n1036\n00:56:33.900 --> 00:56:37.921\nbecause there's a fine line between\nbeing brilliant and an idiot, so.\n\n1037\n00:56:37.921 --> 00:56:40.910\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Just a word of caution.\n\n1038\n00:56:40.910 --> 00:56:45.730\nThe command is nice, it's very secure but\npeople aren't, and so\n\n1039\n00:56:45.730 --> 00:56:48.490\npeople can still make mistakes and\nthat's one example.\n\n1040\n00:56:50.440 --> 00:56:53.190\nAll right,\nwhat is next on our agenda Nate?\n\n1041\n00:56:53.190 --> 00:56:56.430\n>> Well, so we've got Novell to put\n\n1042\n00:56:56.430 --> 00:56:59.515\nsome security measures in place\nto lock down our user accounts.\n\n1043\n00:56:59.515 --> 00:57:00.100\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And so\n\n1044\n00:57:00.100 --> 00:57:05.290\nnow moving from users, now we can\nmove into our systems, our computers.\n\n1045\n00:57:05.290 --> 00:57:07.130\n>> Yeah.\n>> And locking those guys down.\n\n1046\n00:57:07.130 --> 00:57:10.350\n>> You know, one of the things that we\njust talked about was the passwd command,\n\n1047\n00:57:10.350 --> 00:57:13.820\nand I kinda got ahead of\nmyself in an earlier episode.\n\n1048\n00:57:13.820 --> 00:57:16.500\nIn the episode where we're talking\nabout creating user accounts\n\n1049\n00:57:16.500 --> 00:57:18.330\nwe covered passwd in depth.\n\n1050\n00:57:18.330 --> 00:57:21.000\nAnd so in the objective list right here,\nit's calling for\n\n1051\n00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:25.670\nus to talk about passwd, and\nthe shadow files, and user passwords.\n\n1052\n00:57:25.670 --> 00:57:28.230\nAnd we kind of already\ncovered all of that,\n\n1053\n00:57:28.230 --> 00:57:32.630\nso if you are jumping\nthrough going by objective.\n\n1054\n00:57:32.630 --> 00:57:37.850\nWell, for this one jump back to the user\naccount episode where we created those and\n\n1055\n00:57:37.850 --> 00:57:38.976\nyou'll see all that information.\n\n1056\n00:57:38.976 --> 00:57:42.340\nWe've kind of already explained how\nthe shadow file works and those values so\n\n1057\n00:57:42.340 --> 00:57:44.670\nwe've already covered that one.\n\n1058\n00:57:44.670 --> 00:57:47.730\nSome of the other things that we've\ngot here under host security,\n\n1059\n00:57:47.730 --> 00:57:52.100\nyou should always turn off\nservices you don't need.\n\n1060\n00:57:52.100 --> 00:57:54.820\nAt the beginning of the episode\nwe showed you nmap and\n\n1061\n00:57:54.820 --> 00:57:58.470\nnetstat, how we can see services\nthat we're running on our system.\n\n1062\n00:57:58.470 --> 00:58:03.640\nIf you're running a service you don't\nneed, you need to turn it off, okay?\n\n1063\n00:58:03.640 --> 00:58:06.860\nNow some services are ones\nthat you've added yourself.\n\n1064\n00:58:06.860 --> 00:58:11.860\nAnd I think one of the examples I gave\nwas, well here, let me pull this back up.\n\n1065\n00:58:11.860 --> 00:58:16.900\nIf I take a look on my system, I can see\nwhere I'm running i map and pop3 and\n\n1066\n00:58:16.900 --> 00:58:22.140\nso on, those are coming from dovecot and\nI ran it as a regular user.\n\n1067\n00:58:22.140 --> 00:58:26.840\nLet me use my sudo now\nsince I'm in the clear.\n\n1068\n00:58:26.840 --> 00:58:31.700\nAnd let's see, so I can see imaps,\n\n1069\n00:58:31.700 --> 00:58:36.615\nand I can see pop3 and so on, and\nhow they're coming from dovecot.\n\n1070\n00:58:36.615 --> 00:58:41.520\nSo, if I don't wanna run imap and\nall that, I can just uninstall dovecot and\n\n1071\n00:58:41.520 --> 00:58:42.450\nproblem solved, right?\n\n1072\n00:58:42.450 --> 00:58:46.494\nI can do a sudo, yum, remove, dovecot.\n\n1073\n00:58:46.494 --> 00:58:49.150\nProblem solved, right?\n\n1074\n00:58:49.150 --> 00:58:51.070\nWell, what if it's more than that?\n\n1075\n00:58:51.070 --> 00:58:52.650\nWhat if I wanna keep dovecot,\n\n1076\n00:58:52.650 --> 00:58:57.020\nI don't want to get rid of that, I just\nwanna get rid of the non-secure parts.\n\n1077\n00:58:57.020 --> 00:59:00.640\nWell, some programs will have\nconfiguration files, and we can go and\n\n1078\n00:59:00.640 --> 00:59:02.840\nedit them, so\ndovecot is an example of that.\n\n1079\n00:59:02.840 --> 00:59:05.300\nI can go into the dovecot\nconfiguration files and\n\n1080\n00:59:05.300 --> 00:59:07.770\nI can just disable those services,\nall right?\n\n1081\n00:59:07.770 --> 00:59:12.340\nBut other programs might not have that,\nsome programs don't.\n\n1082\n00:59:12.340 --> 00:59:16.290\nAnd if they don't,\nhow do I prevent access to those ports?\n\n1083\n00:59:16.290 --> 00:59:20.140\nWell, if you have a software firewall,\nlike iptables, you can block it there.\n\n1084\n00:59:20.140 --> 00:59:23.040\nAnd if you block it in iptables\nthen nobody can connect to it and\n\n1085\n00:59:23.040 --> 00:59:24.930\nit's solved, right?\n\n1086\n00:59:24.930 --> 00:59:29.660\nBut, many applications, many of\nthe demons that we run inside of Linux,\n\n1087\n00:59:29.660 --> 00:59:33.230\nreference what's called a TCP wrapper.\n\n1088\n00:59:33.230 --> 00:59:38.490\nAnd the TCP wrapper, it's just something\nthat we can attach an application\n\n1089\n00:59:38.490 --> 00:59:42.910\nto that allows us to control\nthe TCP connections to the program.\n\n1090\n00:59:42.910 --> 00:59:44.070\nIt's like a packet filter.\n\n1091\n00:59:44.070 --> 00:59:46.650\nWell I shouldn't say it's like,\nit is a packet filter.\n\n1092\n00:59:46.650 --> 00:59:49.210\nIt lets us filter access\nto an application.\n\n1093\n00:59:49.210 --> 00:59:51.560\nNow not every application uses it.\n\n1094\n00:59:51.560 --> 00:59:55.980\nSo I mentioned dovecot for example, so\nwhat I'm gonna do here is I'm gonna do\n\n1095\n00:59:55.980 --> 01:00:00.120\na which dovecot,\nwhich is gonna tell me where the file is.\n\n1096\n01:00:00.120 --> 01:00:01.740\nCuz I can never remember\nwhere files are so\n\n1097\n01:00:01.740 --> 01:00:03.750\nthat which command is really handy for me.\n\n1098\n01:00:03.750 --> 01:00:05.550\nAnd then I'm going to do a ldd.\n\n1099\n01:00:05.550 --> 01:00:09.900\nNow we had the shared library episode\nwhere we talked about how software calls\n\n1100\n01:00:09.900 --> 01:00:15.500\nvarious libraries, and ldd is one where we\ncan locate the dependencies for a program.\n\n1101\n01:00:15.500 --> 01:00:21.594\nAnd so,\ni'm going to do ldd/user/sbin/dovecot.\n\n1102\n01:00:21.594 --> 01:00:22.235\nOkay.\n\n1103\n01:00:22.235 --> 01:00:26.265\nI wanna see all the libraries that it\ndepends on, and what I'm looking for\n\n1104\n01:00:26.265 --> 01:00:28.355\nis one in particular called libwrap.\n\n1105\n01:00:29.490 --> 01:00:35.630\nIf libwrap is in the dependencies,\nthen I can use a TCP wrapper to filter it.\n\n1106\n01:00:35.630 --> 01:00:38.651\nAnd when I look here, I don't see libwrap.\n\n1107\n01:00:38.651 --> 01:00:43.570\nSo libwrap is not an option for\nfiltering this one, I can either\n\n1108\n01:00:43.570 --> 01:00:48.682\nuse a software firewall like iptables or\nI can go in the configuration for\n\n1109\n01:00:48.682 --> 01:00:52.830\ndovecot and I can turn off those\nparts that I don't want, right.\n\n1110\n01:00:52.830 --> 01:00:56.010\nIf I take a look at something else\nthough like maybe ssh, right?\n\n1111\n01:00:56.010 --> 01:01:01.014\nSo I can say, which sshd, to find it and\n\n1112\n01:01:01.014 --> 01:01:04.369\nldd /usr/sbin/ssad.\n\n1113\n01:01:04.369 --> 01:01:07.140\nIt's got all sorts of stuff in there.\n\n1114\n01:01:07.140 --> 01:01:11.425\nLet me, I'm gonna feed that into grep,\nand I'll look for wrap.\n\n1115\n01:01:13.160 --> 01:01:15.020\nThere we go that's what i'm looking for.\n\n1116\n01:01:15.020 --> 01:01:18.375\nSo, see how in the list\nof dependencies for sshd.\n\n1117\n01:01:18.375 --> 01:01:22.070\nSee how it references libwrap.so.0?\n\n1118\n01:01:22.070 --> 01:01:25.530\nThat's the lib wrapper,\nthat's the TCP wrapper.\n\n1119\n01:01:25.530 --> 01:01:30.200\nAnd because it references that, that\nmeans I can attach a very simple IP or\n\n1120\n01:01:30.200 --> 01:01:31.680\na packet filter to this.\n\n1121\n01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:35.840\nAnd control what ports it allows\nconnections on as well as\n\n1122\n01:01:35.840 --> 01:01:39.330\nwho's even allowed to connect\nto it in the first place.\n\n1123\n01:01:39.330 --> 01:01:42.390\nI might not want people on\nthe Internet connecting using ssh.\n\n1124\n01:01:42.390 --> 01:01:45.300\nI might just want people on\nmy local network to connect.\n\n1125\n01:01:45.300 --> 01:01:47.990\nI can specify that thanks to TCP wrappers.\n\n1126\n01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:52.110\nLooking at the clock, we're a little\nshort on time, so let's stop here, and\n\n1127\n01:01:52.110 --> 01:01:53.930\nwhen we get back,\nI'll show you this in action.\n\n1128\n01:01:53.930 --> 01:01:57.960\nWe'll get a chance to see it and\nkinda mess around with those TCP wrappers.\n\n1129\n01:01:57.960 --> 01:02:01.885\nSo stay tuned, we'll be back after this.\n\n1130\n01:02:01.885 --> 01:02:08.900\n[SOUND]\nAll right, welcome back everybody.\n\n1131\n01:02:08.900 --> 01:02:12.760\nSo, we left off talking about how\nto filter access to a service.\n\n1132\n01:02:12.760 --> 01:02:16.090\nAnd I'm gonna use ssh as my example,\nall right.\n\n1133\n01:02:16.090 --> 01:02:20.382\nIf we have an Internet facing server,\nwe might enable ssh on it, so\n\n1134\n01:02:20.382 --> 01:02:22.890\nthat we can remote into it, and manage it.\n\n1135\n01:02:22.890 --> 01:02:26.060\nBut we don't want to just open it\nup to the whole world where just\n\n1136\n01:02:26.060 --> 01:02:29.470\nanybody in the world can try and build\nan ssh session to it and try and log in.\n\n1137\n01:02:29.470 --> 01:02:32.800\nSomebody could try and brute force\nthe password and get in or whatever.\n\n1138\n01:02:32.800 --> 01:02:36.900\nSo we'll typically combine this\nwith either a software firewall or\n\n1139\n01:02:36.900 --> 01:02:40.730\nTCP wrappers that allow us to\ndo a packet filter to determine\n\n1140\n01:02:40.730 --> 01:02:43.060\nwho it is that's allowed to get connected.\n\n1141\n01:02:43.060 --> 01:02:45.292\nSo I wanna show you guys\nan example of that.\n\n1142\n01:02:45.292 --> 01:02:50.850\nI wanna control who's allowed to\nconnect to this server using ssh.\n\n1143\n01:02:50.850 --> 01:02:55.530\nNow, right before the break, we used ldd\nto look at the dependencies of sshd and\n\n1144\n01:02:55.530 --> 01:03:00.710\nfind out that it did depend on libwrap so\nI can use a TCP wrapper for it, all right.\n\n1145\n01:03:00.710 --> 01:03:03.080\nSo now I need to basically create one.\n\n1146\n01:03:03.080 --> 01:03:05.620\nTCP wrappers are actually pretty simple.\n\n1147\n01:03:05.620 --> 01:03:09.440\nYou might remember when we\nwere working with cron and\n\n1148\n01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:13.840\nat, how they had /etc/cron.allow and\ncron.deny.\n\n1149\n01:03:13.840 --> 01:03:16.210\nWell, that's how TCP wrappers are.\n\n1150\n01:03:16.210 --> 01:03:20.700\nTCP wrappers,\nwe've got /etc/hosts.allow and hosts.deny.\n\n1151\n01:03:20.700 --> 01:03:22.590\nAnd we can go in there,\n\n1152\n01:03:22.590 --> 01:03:26.980\nand we can specify who we want\nto be able to run applications.\n\n1153\n01:03:26.980 --> 01:03:27.850\nNow, you may or\n\n1154\n01:03:27.850 --> 01:03:32.650\nmay not actually have those files yet,\nlet me just do a look here.\n\n1155\n01:03:32.650 --> 01:03:36.310\nYeah, actually, I got them both,\nhosts.allow and hosts.deny.\n\n1156\n01:03:36.310 --> 01:03:38.020\nSome distros don't have them by default,\n\n1157\n01:03:38.020 --> 01:03:42.030\nin which case you just create them,\nbut they're pretty straightforward.\n\n1158\n01:03:42.030 --> 01:03:44.710\nThe difference here, though,\nremember I said with cron,\n\n1159\n01:03:44.710 --> 01:03:49.170\nyou usually wanna use either the allow or\nthe deny, but not both?\n\n1160\n01:03:49.170 --> 01:03:51.043\nHere we actually can use both.\n\n1161\n01:03:51.043 --> 01:03:55.070\nIn deny we specify who we're blocking,\nin allow we specify who we're allowing.\n\n1162\n01:03:55.070 --> 01:04:00.029\nThe deny gets the apply first and\nthen the allow gets applied afterwards.\n\n1163\n01:04:00.029 --> 01:04:02.980\nSo, one of the approaches I\nlike to take is under deny.\n\n1164\n01:04:02.980 --> 01:04:05.185\nI like to deny everything,\njust black it outright.\n\n1165\n01:04:05.185 --> 01:04:09.119\nAnd then under allow we like to just add\nin the one's that we want to allow and\n\n1166\n01:04:09.119 --> 01:04:11.374\nthen it's all kind of locked down to that.\n\n1167\n01:04:11.374 --> 01:04:15.635\nBut on an internet facing server, we might\nwant to allow most people to connect.\n\n1168\n01:04:15.635 --> 01:04:18.166\nIn which case,\nwe're just doing some basic denies.\n\n1169\n01:04:18.166 --> 01:04:19.884\nLet's take a look at that deny file.\n\n1170\n01:04:19.884 --> 01:04:24.935\nSo, I'm gonna edit/etc/host.deny.\n\n1171\n01:04:24.935 --> 01:04:28.522\nSo it's gonna tell me this\nis the host.deny file and\n\n1172\n01:04:28.522 --> 01:04:34.147\nit's gonna tell me that this is pretty\nmuch what's gonna happen with our system,\n\n1173\n01:04:34.147 --> 01:04:39.810\nand we can go in here, and list all the\nvarious things we want to allow or deny.\n\n1174\n01:04:39.810 --> 01:04:42.242\nNow unlike a lot of\ngood documenting stuff,\n\n1175\n01:04:42.242 --> 01:04:46.648\nthis one doesn't really give us any\nexamples, which is a little annoying, but\n\n1176\n01:04:46.648 --> 01:04:49.612\nthe syntax is actually\npretty straightforward.\n\n1177\n01:04:49.612 --> 01:04:52.617\nShoot.\nThis one is I forgot,\n\n1178\n01:04:52.617 --> 01:04:55.611\nI'm just a old dpezet.\n\n1179\n01:04:55.611 --> 01:04:57.388\nI forgot to use my pseudo command.\n\n1180\n01:04:57.388 --> 01:04:59.961\nSo well, actually while I'm out on here,\n\n1181\n01:04:59.961 --> 01:05:04.470\nlet me show you guys the host.allow\nfile and you'll see same thing there.\n\n1182\n01:05:04.470 --> 01:05:07.373\nReally doesn't give you the syntax, but\nthe syntax is really straightforward.\n\n1183\n01:05:07.373 --> 01:05:08.475\nI'll show you guys.\n\n1184\n01:05:08.475 --> 01:05:11.459\nLet's take, for example, my Mac.\n\n1185\n01:05:11.459 --> 01:05:15.045\nSo my Mac over here, it.\n\n1186\n01:05:17.412 --> 01:05:19.107\nHas a couple of IP addresses to it.\n\n1187\n01:05:19.107 --> 01:05:23.958\nIt is 10.1.230.48 is my\nIP address on the Mac and\n\n1188\n01:05:23.958 --> 01:05:27.745\nI want to SSH into that\nsever that's running.\n\n1189\n01:05:27.745 --> 01:05:34.130\nSo I can come in here and say,\nI wanna log in as dpezet on 10.1.230.219.\n\n1190\n01:05:34.130 --> 01:05:35.570\nThat's my server.\n\n1191\n01:05:35.570 --> 01:05:39.355\nAnd so when I connect up, I can punch\nin my password and here we are.\n\n1192\n01:05:39.355 --> 01:05:40.876\nI'm connecting to that Linux box.\n\n1193\n01:05:40.876 --> 01:05:43.569\nIf I do a host name,\nI can see I'm on dp-linux.\n\n1194\n01:05:43.569 --> 01:05:46.541\nAnd if I do a who am I,\nI'm logged in as dpezet.\n\n1195\n01:05:46.541 --> 01:05:51.127\nAnd a who shows me that I'm\nlogged in from 10.1.230.48.\n\n1196\n01:05:51.127 --> 01:05:56.771\nLet's say that I don't wanna allow that\nconnection, I wanna block 10.1.230.48.\n\n1197\n01:05:56.771 --> 01:05:59.998\nThat should not be allowed\nto connect up to my system.\n\n1198\n01:05:59.998 --> 01:06:05.041\nWell, back here,\nI can go into my host.deny.\n\n1199\n01:06:05.041 --> 01:06:08.896\nAnd I'm gonna do a pseudo, because\nyou need to be root to to modify it.\n\n1200\n01:06:08.896 --> 01:06:14.120\nAnd so here I am and I can come in, and\nI'm gonna add a line in here at the end\n\n1201\n01:06:14.120 --> 01:06:19.621\ntelling it that I want to do a deny, and\nthe deny statements are pretty easy.\n\n1202\n01:06:19.621 --> 01:06:23.046\nFirst of you say,\nwhat it is your denying access to?\n\n1203\n01:06:23.046 --> 01:06:25.299\nIn my case, it's sshd.\n\n1204\n01:06:25.299 --> 01:06:27.345\nIf you were doing dovecot,\nyou'd dovecot in your,\n\n1205\n01:06:27.345 --> 01:06:30.283\nwell, no dovecot didn't support libwrap,\nso you wouldn't do that one.\n\n1206\n01:06:30.283 --> 01:06:33.824\nBut whatever process it is\nthat does support libwrap.\n\n1207\n01:06:33.824 --> 01:06:38.430\nSo I'm gonna say, sshd and\nthen you do a little colon and\n\n1208\n01:06:38.430 --> 01:06:40.685\nyou can do a particular IP.\n\n1209\n01:06:40.685 --> 01:06:45.991\nSo there, that's my Mac, 10.1.230.48.\n\n1210\n01:06:45.991 --> 01:06:51.034\nNow, that IP is gonna be\ndenied to connect to sshd.\n\n1211\n01:06:51.034 --> 01:06:54.239\nYou can also do networks.\n\n1212\n01:06:54.239 --> 01:06:59.696\nSo you could say, like a private range or\nsomething like that.\n\n1213\n01:06:59.696 --> 01:07:06.523\nIf I can type it like that and that's\ngonna say that whole, actually hang on.\n\n1214\n01:07:06.523 --> 01:07:08.834\nI don't think it takes notation,\nI think you have to do the full one.\n\n1215\n01:07:08.834 --> 01:07:12.955\nThere, so we punch it in and\nthat says, this entire network.\n\n1216\n01:07:12.955 --> 01:07:18.656\n192.168.0 is denied or\nwhat we may choose to do is come in here.\n\n1217\n01:07:18.656 --> 01:07:24.019\nAnd say for sshd, we're going to deny all.\n\n1218\n01:07:24.019 --> 01:07:27.943\nWe're not gonna allow anybody to\nconnect via ssh to this server.\n\n1219\n01:07:27.943 --> 01:07:31.135\nSo just that all tag and\nI don't think it's case sensitive.\n\n1220\n01:07:31.135 --> 01:07:32.354\nI'm gonna bumped it at to ALL.\n\n1221\n01:07:32.354 --> 01:07:35.453\nSo I'm gonna say, sshd is denied to ALL.\n\n1222\n01:07:35.453 --> 01:07:38.332\nNobody can connectivity ssh.\n\n1223\n01:07:38.332 --> 01:07:42.937\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and save that,\nand then I'm gonna jump back\n\n1224\n01:07:42.937 --> 01:07:47.639\nover to my other server, and\ngive it a shot, and see what happens.\n\n1225\n01:07:47.639 --> 01:07:51.796\nSo if I jump back to my Mac,\nI was able to connect in just moment ago.\n\n1226\n01:07:51.796 --> 01:07:56.695\nI'm gonna try now and it sits there.\n\n1227\n01:07:56.695 --> 01:08:00.132\nIt's reaching out, trying to get\nto the server cannot connect.\n\n1228\n01:08:00.132 --> 01:08:04.672\nThat tcp wrapper is kicking in and\ndetecting it, and blocking it.\n\n1229\n01:08:04.672 --> 01:08:10.721\nNow remember, the deny file applies first\nand then the allow applies afterwards.\n\n1230\n01:08:10.721 --> 01:08:16.092\nSo I can go back over here and\nI can modify host.allow and\n\n1231\n01:08:16.092 --> 01:08:22.961\nI can add an entry in here that says,\nsshd : 10.1.230.48.\n\n1232\n01:08:22.961 --> 01:08:28.125\nI'm specifically allowing my laptop or\nhere, I'll do the network.\n\n1233\n01:08:28.125 --> 01:08:30.946\nThis is the ITProTV studio network.\n\n1234\n01:08:30.946 --> 01:08:35.720\nSo I'll go ahead and\nadd that, and there we go.\n\n1235\n01:08:35.720 --> 01:08:36.978\nSo now that that's saved,\n\n1236\n01:08:36.978 --> 01:08:39.830\nanybody here on the studio network\nshould be able to connect.\n\n1237\n01:08:39.830 --> 01:08:43.627\nAnd if I go back here and\ntry that connection again, there we go.\n\n1238\n01:08:43.627 --> 01:08:45.323\nNow, I can get in, right?\n\n1239\n01:08:45.323 --> 01:08:48.643\nSo, here I am connected to dp-linux.\n\n1240\n01:08:48.643 --> 01:08:53.731\nSo that tcp wrapper,\nreally handy and it's basically\n\n1241\n01:08:53.731 --> 01:08:59.825\nbuilt-in to any service or\nfunction that depends upon libwrap.\n\n1242\n01:08:59.825 --> 01:09:03.787\nIf you see that in the dependency\nlist when you run ldd and\n\n1243\n01:09:03.787 --> 01:09:06.581\nwhatever service it is, so like sshd.\n\n1244\n01:09:06.581 --> 01:09:09.567\nIf you see libwrap and\nit's list of dependencies,\n\n1245\n01:09:09.567 --> 01:09:11.934\nyou know you can use those tcp wrappers.\n\n1246\n01:09:11.934 --> 01:09:14.368\nA software firewall be\njust as effective and\n\n1247\n01:09:14.368 --> 01:09:16.813\nNate had a great question\nduring the break.\n\n1248\n01:09:16.813 --> 01:09:19.635\nHe said,\nwhich one would you use if you have both?\n\n1249\n01:09:19.635 --> 01:09:23.975\nAnd I said, the tcp wrappers\nare the most efficient, but\n\n1250\n01:09:23.975 --> 01:09:28.350\nI hate having things in\ntwo different places.\n\n1251\n01:09:28.350 --> 01:09:31.380\nI hate having firewall rules over here and\n\n1252\n01:09:31.380 --> 01:09:35.880\ntcp libwrapper stuff over here,\nI'd rather have it all in one place.\n\n1253\n01:09:35.880 --> 01:09:39.197\nAnd so for me, I almost always do\na software firewall like IP tables.\n\n1254\n01:09:39.197 --> 01:09:41.942\nAnd then I just put all my\nrules in there in one place and\n\n1255\n01:09:41.942 --> 01:09:43.656\nI don't mess with tcp wrappers.\n\n1256\n01:09:43.656 --> 01:09:48.533\nBut for the exam,\nIP tables is considered not neutral.\n\n1257\n01:09:48.533 --> 01:09:52.471\nLike different OSes use different\nfirewalls, livewrap or tcp wrappers,\n\n1258\n01:09:52.471 --> 01:09:54.790\nthat's the one that works on every system.\n\n1259\n01:09:54.790 --> 01:09:57.197\nSo, that's the one that's on the exam.\n\n1260\n01:09:57.197 --> 01:10:03.595\nNow in that example, I use ssh.\n\n1261\n01:10:03.595 --> 01:10:06.930\nI've used ssh several\ntimes during the show.\n\n1262\n01:10:06.930 --> 01:10:09.330\nWe need to talk about ssh a little bit.\n\n1263\n01:10:09.330 --> 01:10:12.606\nSsh is a pretty cool program,\nbecause what it does,\n\n1264\n01:10:12.606 --> 01:10:17.155\nit allows us to get a remote shell and\ndo it over an encrypted connection.\n\n1265\n01:10:17.155 --> 01:10:18.734\nWe use to use Telnet.\n\n1266\n01:10:18.734 --> 01:10:20.763\nTelnet would give us a remote shell,\n\n1267\n01:10:20.763 --> 01:10:24.506\nbut everything you typed was sent\nin plaintext across the network.\n\n1268\n01:10:24.506 --> 01:10:25.416\nYour username,\n\n1269\n01:10:25.416 --> 01:10:30.102\nyour password, your commands, the output\non your screen, all that was plaintext.\n\n1270\n01:10:30.102 --> 01:10:33.260\nAnybody can fire up a network sniffer,\ncapture the data.\n\n1271\n01:10:33.260 --> 01:10:35.594\nAnd now, you're just screwed.\n\n1272\n01:10:35.594 --> 01:10:37.718\nSo, ssh fixes that.\n\n1273\n01:10:37.718 --> 01:10:40.720\nSshbuilds a shell just like telnet does,\nbut\n\n1274\n01:10:40.720 --> 01:10:44.917\nit encrypts every single\ncommunication between the systems.\n\n1275\n01:10:44.917 --> 01:10:51.361\nSo, every Linux distribution these days\nships with ssh installed and turned on.\n\n1276\n01:10:51.361 --> 01:10:54.900\nI didn't have to configure it on\nthis system, it was already there.\n\n1277\n01:10:54.900 --> 01:10:58.040\nSo, we can ssh in and\ngain access to the system.\n\n1278\n01:10:59.230 --> 01:11:03.010\nNow, there's two parts to\nauthenticating with ssh.\n\n1279\n01:11:03.010 --> 01:11:06.741\nThe first part is a certificate and\nthe second part is your user name, and\n\n1280\n01:11:06.741 --> 01:11:07.364\npassword.\n\n1281\n01:11:07.364 --> 01:11:12.441\nWhen you connect to a server with ssh,\nit presents to you a a certificate and\n\n1282\n01:11:12.441 --> 01:11:15.747\nyou can use that certificate\nto verify whether or\n\n1283\n01:11:15.747 --> 01:11:18.503\nnot that server is who they say they are.\n\n1284\n01:11:18.503 --> 01:11:22.184\nWell, how do you know if they\nare who they say they are?\n\n1285\n01:11:22.184 --> 01:11:27.291\nWhen you go to connect that first time,\nhow do you know that certificate is legit,\n\n1286\n01:11:27.291 --> 01:11:29.964\nthat it is the one that\nis provided by them?\n\n1287\n01:11:29.964 --> 01:11:32.737\nWell, most people don't think about that.\n\n1288\n01:11:32.737 --> 01:11:35.861\nMost people don't worry, they just hop\non in there and they give it a go right.\n\n1289\n01:11:35.861 --> 01:11:40.470\nSo like if I'm sitting here on my\nmachine and I ssh, and the syntax for\n\n1290\n01:11:40.470 --> 01:11:41.990\nssh is really simple.\n\n1291\n01:11:41.990 --> 01:11:49.164\nSsh and then the username@ a host name,\nI owe our IP.\n\n1292\n01:11:49.164 --> 01:11:53.774\nSo if I wanna ssh into one of the switches\nI have here in the office, I can say,\n\n1293\n01:11:53.774 --> 01:11:55.733\nadmin@10.1.10.1.\n\n1294\n01:11:55.733 --> 01:11:56.500\nAll right.\n\n1295\n01:11:56.500 --> 01:12:01.270\nAnother way I could write that is\nssh -l followed by a login name,\n\n1296\n01:12:01.270 --> 01:12:03.650\nand then 10.1.10.1.\n\n1297\n01:12:03.650 --> 01:12:06.070\nOr if you leave the login name off,\n\n1298\n01:12:06.070 --> 01:12:08.130\nit'll use whatever account\nyou're logged in with.\n\n1299\n01:12:08.130 --> 01:12:10.970\nSo if I'm logged in as dpezet,\nthat's what it would use.\n\n1300\n01:12:10.970 --> 01:12:13.820\nBut if I run that, it's gonna try and\nconnect to that switch.\n\n1301\n01:12:13.820 --> 01:12:15.090\nAnd what do I get?\n\n1302\n01:12:15.090 --> 01:12:20.660\nI get a message saying here is the RSA\nkey fingerprint for that system.\n\n1303\n01:12:20.660 --> 01:12:22.450\nAre you sure you want to connect?\n\n1304\n01:12:22.450 --> 01:12:23.820\nIs this a valid certificate?\n\n1305\n01:12:25.230 --> 01:12:26.160\nI don't know.\n\n1306\n01:12:26.160 --> 01:12:28.050\nI don't know if it's valid or not, right?\n\n1307\n01:12:28.050 --> 01:12:29.820\nHow do I know if this is valid or not?\n\n1308\n01:12:29.820 --> 01:12:35.370\nWell, whoever set this switch up\nshould have told me ahead of time\n\n1309\n01:12:35.370 --> 01:12:37.950\nwhat that key was,\nwhat that certificate was.\n\n1310\n01:12:37.950 --> 01:12:41.330\nSo I could look at this and match it with\nwhat they have and say, yeah that is it.\n\n1311\n01:12:41.330 --> 01:12:42.700\nAll right.\n\n1312\n01:12:42.700 --> 01:12:45.420\nBut if I don't know, the best thing\nto do here is to just say no.\n\n1313\n01:12:45.420 --> 01:12:47.300\nAll right.\n\n1314\n01:12:47.300 --> 01:12:48.880\nAnd then go and find out.\n\n1315\n01:12:48.880 --> 01:12:51.270\nGo to the admin and say hey can give\nyou give me the key fingerprint so\n\n1316\n01:12:51.270 --> 01:12:52.790\nI know whether or\nnot this is the right one,\n\n1317\n01:12:52.790 --> 01:12:55.210\nwhether I'm actually legitimately\nconnecting to the right host.\n\n1318\n01:12:55.210 --> 01:12:57.470\nAll right, that's important.\n\n1319\n01:12:57.470 --> 01:13:02.380\nNow the first time you connect\nit's going to cache that value and\n\n1320\n01:13:02.380 --> 01:13:05.370\nthe value is going to be cached\ninside of your user profile so\n\n1321\n01:13:05.370 --> 01:13:08.090\nyou'll have a record of it going forward.\n\n1322\n01:13:08.090 --> 01:13:13.000\nSo, for example, if I do connect to that\nhost, it'll cache that fingerprint and\n\n1323\n01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.830\nthen every time from now on when I\nconnect, as long as that fingerprint\n\n1324\n01:13:15.830 --> 01:13:19.190\ndoesn't change,\nI can connect right up and it works.\n\n1325\n01:13:19.190 --> 01:13:24.790\nSo earlier, when I ssh'd from my Mac,\nlet me see if it's still in my history.\n\n1326\n01:13:24.790 --> 01:13:26.090\nProbably not.\n\n1327\n01:13:26.090 --> 01:13:27.600\nBut when I connected in.\n\n1328\n01:13:27.600 --> 01:13:29.670\nHere we go.\n\n1329\n01:13:29.670 --> 01:13:33.690\nIt said the authenticity of\nthat host cannot be verified;\n\n1330\n01:13:33.690 --> 01:13:35.695\nhere's the fingerprint are you\nsure sure you want to connect?\n\n1331\n01:13:35.695 --> 01:13:37.415\nAnd I just said yes.\n\n1332\n01:13:37.415 --> 01:13:40.951\nAll right?\nWell when I did that, in my directory,\n\n1333\n01:13:40.951 --> 01:13:44.385\nactually apparently not in my directory.\n\n1334\n01:13:44.385 --> 01:13:45.225\nThere it is.\n\n1335\n01:13:45.225 --> 01:13:48.847\nIt created a folder called .ssh and\n\n1336\n01:13:48.847 --> 01:13:54.547\nin that folder it cached that credential,\nI say it and it's not there.\n\n1337\n01:13:54.547 --> 01:13:58.227\nIt's supposed to cache that credential,\nso now its got it on record and\n\n1338\n01:13:58.227 --> 01:14:01.223\nremember they'll be a known host file,\nin there,\n\n1339\n01:14:01.223 --> 01:14:03.433\napparently it's a little\ndifferent on the Mac.\n\n1340\n01:14:03.433 --> 01:14:06.403\nMacs run BSD and\nthey do all sorts of weird things.\n\n1341\n01:14:06.403 --> 01:14:07.633\nLet me go back to my Linux box.\n\n1342\n01:14:07.633 --> 01:14:11.263\nThis is Linux plus, and\nnot Max plus, anyway.\n\n1343\n01:14:11.263 --> 01:14:14.840\nSo, if I SSH into that switch okay?\n\n1344\n01:14:14.840 --> 01:14:16.740\nSo I'm just going to SSH\nover into that switch and\n\n1345\n01:14:16.740 --> 01:14:18.350\nI'll just say yes to connect to it.\n\n1346\n01:14:19.700 --> 01:14:20.350\nAll right.\n\n1347\n01:14:20.350 --> 01:14:23.490\nAnd see how it says permanently\nadded ten one ten one\n\n1348\n01:14:23.490 --> 01:14:24.990\nrsa to the list of known hosts.\n\n1349\n01:14:24.990 --> 01:14:29.480\nSo it's letting me know that it's\ngoing to remember this for me.\n\n1350\n01:14:29.480 --> 01:14:31.140\nAnd I guess I have to put\nin the right password.\n\n1351\n01:14:31.140 --> 01:14:34.560\nWhat kind of system requires\nthe correct password?\n\n1352\n01:14:34.560 --> 01:14:35.540\nSo now it's permanently edited.\n\n1353\n01:14:35.540 --> 01:14:36.860\nWhat does that mean?\n\n1354\n01:14:36.860 --> 01:14:43.120\nWell here in my directory, if I do\nan ls -la, I'll see that .ssh folder.\n\n1355\n01:14:44.190 --> 01:14:48.280\nAnd if I pull up a list in there,\nI see known hosts.\n\n1356\n01:14:48.280 --> 01:14:53.160\nAnd if I do a more_known_hosts,\nthere it is.\n\n1357\n01:14:53.160 --> 01:15:00.030\nI can see host 10.1.10.1,\nssh-rsa letting me know it's an RSA key\n\n1358\n01:15:00.030 --> 01:15:04.980\nfollowed by the public key for\nthe host right there entered in that file.\n\n1359\n01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.678\nIf somebody had given me that earlier,\n\n1360\n01:15:08.678 --> 01:15:13.660\nI could have put it in here and it\nwouldn't bother me about that, right, so\n\n1361\n01:15:13.660 --> 01:15:16.320\nfor example if I remove that\nI'm just gonna get rid of it.\n\n1362\n01:15:17.490 --> 01:15:21.070\nAll right, and now I'm going to ssh.\n\n1363\n01:15:21.070 --> 01:15:21.840\nHere I'll just bring it back up.\n\n1364\n01:15:21.840 --> 01:15:24.530\nIt would've been faster for me to type it.\n\n1365\n01:15:24.530 --> 01:15:28.240\nI'm gonna SSH back in and see how it's\nprompting me about the fingerprint again?\n\n1366\n01:15:28.240 --> 01:15:28.930\nIt doesn't remember.\n\n1367\n01:15:28.930 --> 01:15:30.790\nWell I'm gonna say no.\n\n1368\n01:15:30.790 --> 01:15:32.950\nI'm not going to pull it.\n\n1369\n01:15:32.950 --> 01:15:35.980\nAnd what I can do is I can use some\nof the command line modifiers for\n\n1370\n01:15:35.980 --> 01:15:39.140\nSSH to go out and\nretrieve that ahead of time.\n\n1371\n01:15:39.140 --> 01:15:42.620\nSo, some of the different\ncommands we can run.\n\n1372\n01:15:44.090 --> 01:15:46.453\nWell one that I like is ssh.\n\n1373\n01:15:46.453 --> 01:15:48.902\nMake sure this gets to\nthe top of my screen.\n\n1374\n01:15:48.902 --> 01:15:54.511\nSSH key scan, that's a utility we\ncan use to reach out to a system and\n\n1375\n01:15:54.511 --> 01:15:56.890\nget a copy of it's Key.\n\n1376\n01:15:56.890 --> 01:16:00.600\nSo if I'm at the office, and\nI'm sitting right here by that switch, and\n\n1377\n01:16:00.600 --> 01:16:04.830\nI know it's the real switch,\nI can do ssh-keyscan 10.1.10.1, and\n\n1378\n01:16:04.830 --> 01:16:08.530\nit'll reach out to it, and\nit'll get that key, all right?\n\n1379\n01:16:10.550 --> 01:16:16.689\nEven better, I could take that and\nI could do a pipe,\n\n1380\n01:16:16.689 --> 01:16:22.410\nor a double pipe,\nI'll probably just do a pipe,\n\n1381\n01:16:22.410 --> 01:16:26.476\nInto ~/.ssh/known_hosts.\n\n1382\n01:16:26.476 --> 01:16:31.388\nAnd when you do that, it's gonna write\nthe output for that command into your\n\n1383\n01:16:31.388 --> 01:16:36.990\nknown_hosts file, and now it's there,\nand we've got the key ahead of time.\n\n1384\n01:16:36.990 --> 01:16:40.790\nNow if I go home, and\nI go to ssh into this host, if somebody\n\n1385\n01:16:40.790 --> 01:16:45.580\nman-in-the-middles me and redirects my\ntraffic, they key's not gonna match.\n\n1386\n01:16:45.580 --> 01:16:48.820\nBut if I get back to the real switch,\nthe key will match and\n\n1387\n01:16:48.820 --> 01:16:50.620\nit will let me in without asking.\n\n1388\n01:16:50.620 --> 01:16:52.470\nIf I take a look at what's in that file.\n\n1389\n01:16:56.675 --> 01:16:58.790\nI can see the key right there.\n\n1390\n01:16:58.790 --> 01:17:05.870\nNow I did a single, when I ran that\nI did a single greater than symbol.\n\n1391\n01:17:05.870 --> 01:17:10.740\nIf that file all ready exists that will\nerase it and replace it with this content.\n\n1392\n01:17:10.740 --> 01:17:16.530\nSo if you do a double pipe, or a greater\nthan sign, it will append to the file.\n\n1393\n01:17:16.530 --> 01:17:17.950\nAnd that's normally what you want.\n\n1394\n01:17:17.950 --> 01:17:19.770\nYou don't wanna erase\nthe other host you know about.\n\n1395\n01:17:19.770 --> 01:17:21.390\nYou wanna add to it.\n\n1396\n01:17:21.390 --> 01:17:27.110\nSo I can add to it by doing the double\npipes and that'll punch it in,\n\n1397\n01:17:27.110 --> 01:17:30.970\nso for example,\nif I wanna do 127.0.0.1, myself right?\n\n1398\n01:17:30.970 --> 01:17:35.520\nI can do that it'll get the key and\nit will append it to my known host file.\n\n1399\n01:17:37.050 --> 01:17:37.720\nAll right?\n\n1400\n01:17:37.720 --> 01:17:41.180\nAnd so now if I take a look at\nwhat's in that known host file.\n\n1401\n01:17:41.180 --> 01:17:45.150\nApparently does it not work against I\nmight not be able to do it against myself.\n\n1402\n01:17:46.650 --> 01:17:48.647\nLet's try that just where I can see it.\n\n1403\n01:17:51.403 --> 01:17:52.630\nHere.\nI'll try my real IP.\n\n1404\n01:17:52.630 --> 01:17:55.010\nIt works against the real IP,\nso let me do that.\n\n1405\n01:17:55.010 --> 01:17:57.052\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\njust do it against my real IP.\n\n1406\n01:17:57.052 --> 01:18:02.351\n[SOUND] 10.1.238.219.\n\n1407\n01:18:02.351 --> 01:18:03.418\nThere we go.\n\n1408\n01:18:03.418 --> 01:18:07.358\nAnd now if I take a look inside of that\nknown host file, see I've got them both.\n\n1409\n01:18:07.358 --> 01:18:09.910\nI guess it's kinda hard to see\nbecause it's jumbled mess.\n\n1410\n01:18:09.910 --> 01:18:15.350\nBut I got 10 1 10 1 and I've got\n10.1.230.219, so I just appended it.\n\n1411\n01:18:15.350 --> 01:18:18.050\nSo remember to use\nthe double-greater-than sign for it.\n\n1412\n01:18:18.050 --> 01:18:21.700\nNow that those are stored though,\nI've got them stored, I can go home or\n\n1413\n01:18:21.700 --> 01:18:23.400\ngo wherever I need to go.\n\n1414\n01:18:23.400 --> 01:18:28.467\nAnd now when I ssh into that switch,\nwhen I go to connect to it,\n\n1415\n01:18:28.467 --> 01:18:31.885\nit's not gonna prompt me about that key.\n\n1416\n01:18:31.885 --> 01:18:32.965\nIt's all ready got it.\n\n1417\n01:18:32.965 --> 01:18:34.656\nIt matches, right?\n\n1418\n01:18:34.656 --> 01:18:38.114\nSame thing if I connect to my self.\n\n1419\n01:18:38.114 --> 01:18:44.975\nIf I go to 10.0.230.219 I don't wanna\nbe admin though, I wanna be dpeset.\n\n1420\n01:18:46.620 --> 01:18:49.970\nAnd it all ready has it and\nit's gonna match.\n\n1421\n01:18:49.970 --> 01:18:52.490\nAll right, so that's pretty cool,\nthat's pretty straightforward.\n\n1422\n01:18:52.490 --> 01:18:53.490\nHere's the thing people forget.\n\n1423\n01:18:54.930 --> 01:18:59.020\nYou should probably think about changing\nthose certificates from time to time.\n\n1424\n01:18:59.020 --> 01:19:01.630\nI recommend about once a year\nto change those certificates.\n\n1425\n01:19:01.630 --> 01:19:02.459\nThey're pretty strong.\n\n1426\n01:19:03.710 --> 01:19:07.180\nBut, things happen so every now and\nthen we need to change them out.\n\n1427\n01:19:07.180 --> 01:19:10.040\nTo change them out is really\nnot that big of a deal.\n\n1428\n01:19:10.040 --> 01:19:13.920\nThe certificates used for\nSSH are stored in a central location.\n\n1429\n01:19:13.920 --> 01:19:21.966\nIf we go into /etc/ssh and we take\na look in there, you'll see six files.\n\n1430\n01:19:21.966 --> 01:19:25.040\nSSH host dsakey.\n\n1431\n01:19:25.040 --> 01:19:30.610\nKey.pub, SSH host key,\nkey pub, RSA key, key pub.\n\n1432\n01:19:30.610 --> 01:19:32.360\nThose six files.\n\n1433\n01:19:32.360 --> 01:19:34.970\nThose are the keys used for SSH.\n\n1434\n01:19:34.970 --> 01:19:37.670\nSSH version one, version two and so on.\n\n1435\n01:19:37.670 --> 01:19:39.080\nThose are the keys.\n\n1436\n01:19:39.080 --> 01:19:42.810\nSo if it's time for\nme to update my keys to something new.\n\n1437\n01:19:42.810 --> 01:19:46.160\nI need to remove those and recreate them.\n\n1438\n01:19:46.160 --> 01:19:46.680\nAll right?\n\n1439\n01:19:46.680 --> 01:19:47.510\nSo I'm going to do that.\n\n1440\n01:19:47.510 --> 01:19:51.743\nNow as a regular user I can do it so\nI'm going to use sudo.\n\n1441\n01:19:51.743 --> 01:19:59.366\nAnd I'm going to say rm-f /etc/ssh/ *key*.\n\n1442\n01:19:59.366 --> 01:20:02.500\nI want to remove any file that\nhas the word key in the name.\n\n1443\n01:20:02.500 --> 01:20:03.971\nAll right?\nSo, that's gonna be the those\n\n1444\n01:20:03.971 --> 01:20:04.576\nsix key files.\n\n1445\n01:20:04.576 --> 01:20:07.095\nSo, I'm just going to blow those away.\n\n1446\n01:20:07.095 --> 01:20:07.756\nAll right.\n\n1447\n01:20:07.756 --> 01:20:10.005\nAnd I'll just verify that they are gone.\n\n1448\n01:20:12.675 --> 01:20:14.462\nAnd they are, all right?\n\n1449\n01:20:14.462 --> 01:20:16.042\nAnd then I'm just gonna regenerate them.\n\n1450\n01:20:16.042 --> 01:20:19.731\nWe regenerate them by saying, and\nI'll make sure to use sudo to do this,\n\n1451\n01:20:19.731 --> 01:20:21.553\notherwise it's gonna be mad at me.\n\n1452\n01:20:21.553 --> 01:20:27.844\nssh-keygen- t rsa1\n\n1453\n01:20:27.844 --> 01:20:37.119\n/etc/ssh/ssh_host_key.\n\n1454\n01:20:37.119 --> 01:20:37.757\nAll right?\n\n1455\n01:20:37.757 --> 01:20:40.433\nSo, I'm gonna run that.\n\n1456\n01:20:40.433 --> 01:20:42.116\nHang on, I got a typo in here somewhere.\n\n1457\n01:20:42.116 --> 01:20:47.931\nSSHkeygen/trsa1-f.\n\n1458\n01:20:47.931 --> 01:20:51.441\nI need to tell it that's\nwhere I'm outputting it to.\n\n1459\n01:20:51.441 --> 01:20:52.161\nAll right.\n\n1460\n01:20:52.161 --> 01:20:54.210\nAnd it's gonna ask me for a pass phrase.\n\n1461\n01:20:54.210 --> 01:20:58.870\nSo, if I ever want to export and\nimport this onto another system,\n\n1462\n01:20:58.870 --> 01:21:00.510\nI'll have to provide a pass phrase.\n\n1463\n01:21:00.510 --> 01:21:02.030\nSo, I can punch in when I want it.\n\n1464\n01:21:02.030 --> 01:21:05.360\nYou don't have to put a pass phrase,\nbut if I don't put a pass phrase and\n\n1465\n01:21:05.360 --> 01:21:09.480\nsomebody gets this file,\nthen they'll have my private key.\n\n1466\n01:21:09.480 --> 01:21:13.610\nThey'll be able to decrypt SSH sessions\nthat are going on to this in real time.\n\n1467\n01:21:13.610 --> 01:21:15.670\nSo, it's a security concern.\n\n1468\n01:21:15.670 --> 01:21:18.220\nSo, you typically do wanna\nattach a passphrase.\n\n1469\n01:21:18.220 --> 01:21:20.747\nIt'll probably not let me do a basic.\n\n1470\n01:21:20.747 --> 01:21:22.260\nIt will.\nThere we go.\n\n1471\n01:21:22.260 --> 01:21:23.390\nSo, I'll put one on there.\n\n1472\n01:21:23.390 --> 01:21:23.900\nThere it goes.\n\n1473\n01:21:23.900 --> 01:21:25.330\nIt just generated that one.\n\n1474\n01:21:25.330 --> 01:21:28.097\nI just regenerated my SSH host key.\n\n1475\n01:21:28.097 --> 01:21:28.890\nAll right?\n\n1476\n01:21:28.890 --> 01:21:31.242\nBut I also need to regenerate\nsome of the other ones, right?\n\n1477\n01:21:31.242 --> 01:21:34.815\nThat's just the host key, and\nif I take a look in here,\n\n1478\n01:21:34.815 --> 01:21:38.900\nI now have host underscore key and\nhost underscore key.pub.\n\n1479\n01:21:38.900 --> 01:21:41.730\nSo, I've got those two, we really\nneed to regenerate the other ones,\n\n1480\n01:21:41.730 --> 01:21:43.230\ntoo, if we want them.\n\n1481\n01:21:43.230 --> 01:21:45.770\nThe only difference between it and\nthe other ones is this little dash T,\n\n1482\n01:21:45.770 --> 01:21:47.102\nwhere we did RSA.\n\n1483\n01:21:47.102 --> 01:21:49.930\nWe generated that for the host.\n\n1484\n01:21:49.930 --> 01:21:52.390\nWe can go and\nregenerate the other two if we need them.\n\n1485\n01:21:52.390 --> 01:21:53.552\nNow, I say if we them.\n\n1486\n01:21:53.552 --> 01:21:56.490\nThe one we generated is\nactually the secure one, and\n\n1487\n01:21:56.490 --> 01:21:58.055\nthat's normally all we need.\n\n1488\n01:21:58.055 --> 01:22:00.590\nSo, we might not even choose\nto regenerate the other ones.\n\n1489\n01:22:02.799 --> 01:22:08.466\n>> So, then, Don, so, then, off the top\nof your head would you happen to\n\n1490\n01:22:08.466 --> 01:22:13.866\nknow how many bits are in this key or\nhow secure this key is by chance?\n\n1491\n01:22:13.866 --> 01:22:15.340\n>> I don't know\nthe specific bits off hand.\n\n1492\n01:22:15.340 --> 01:22:18.090\nI know it does SSH version two, and\n\n1493\n01:22:18.090 --> 01:22:21.300\na minimum requirement of version\ntwo is at least a 1024 bit key.\n\n1494\n01:22:21.300 --> 01:22:22.240\nSo, it's at least over that.\n\n1495\n01:22:22.240 --> 01:22:24.500\nVersion one, it has to be 768 bit.\n\n1496\n01:22:24.500 --> 01:22:29.055\nI believe it does a 2048 bit, but\nI'd have to pull it up to see.\n\n1497\n01:22:29.055 --> 01:22:33.370\n>> Right.\n>> Yeah, I do not recall.\n\n1498\n01:22:33.370 --> 01:22:34.624\nAll right.\nSo, I'll go ahead and\n\n1499\n01:22:34.624 --> 01:22:36.185\ngenerate the other ones while I'm in here.\n\n1500\n01:22:36.185 --> 01:22:38.725\nSo, I did SSH key gen.\n\n1501\n01:22:38.725 --> 01:22:42.355\nLet me move this up to the top of the\nscreen so we can see that full command.\n\n1502\n01:22:44.075 --> 01:22:44.645\nThere.\n\n1503\n01:22:44.645 --> 01:22:49.135\nSo, I did the full, SSH key gen for RSA 1.\n\n1504\n01:22:49.135 --> 01:22:52.780\nAnd so,\nI did that to populate the host key.\n\n1505\n01:22:52.780 --> 01:22:56.494\nThe next one I need to do is\njust the regular RSA keys.\n\n1506\n01:22:56.494 --> 01:23:00.235\nSo, I'll drop that down to RSA, and\n\n1507\n01:23:00.235 --> 01:23:06.282\nI'll change the name of this\none to ssh_host_rsa_key.\n\n1508\n01:23:06.282 --> 01:23:08.868\nAll right.\nAnd I'll put in a pass phrase there, too.\n\n1509\n01:23:10.608 --> 01:23:11.352\nAll right.\n\n1510\n01:23:11.352 --> 01:23:15.670\nAnd then, the last one is the DSA key.\n\n1511\n01:23:15.670 --> 01:23:20.680\nSo, I'm just gonna change that to DSA,\nand change this to DSA, also.\n\n1512\n01:23:25.337 --> 01:23:26.416\nThere.\n\n1513\n01:23:26.416 --> 01:23:30.165\nAnd now, if I take a look at my directory,\nall new files.\n\n1514\n01:23:30.165 --> 01:23:32.440\nOkay?\nNow, here's the problem.\n\n1515\n01:23:32.440 --> 01:23:38.600\nAnybody out there who had my old\nkey cached, now it's a new key.\n\n1516\n01:23:38.600 --> 01:23:41.570\nSSH is already up and\nrunning using a new key.\n\n1517\n01:23:41.570 --> 01:23:42.990\nAnd so, they're gonna get a flag.\n\n1518\n01:23:42.990 --> 01:23:46.220\nAnd what I would really need to\ndo is take my public key, and\n\n1519\n01:23:46.220 --> 01:23:48.265\nI could then send that to my other users.\n\n1520\n01:23:48.265 --> 01:23:52.330\nAnd I can say, hey, if you've got a cache,\nhere's the new key, go and\n\n1521\n01:23:52.330 --> 01:23:55.550\nedit your known host file and\nswap it out for this.\n\n1522\n01:23:55.550 --> 01:23:58.880\nOr if you're at the corporate network and\nyou know you've got a good connection to\n\n1523\n01:23:58.880 --> 01:24:03.030\nthis device, you can just pull it straight\nfrom it using the SSH key scan command.\n\n1524\n01:24:03.030 --> 01:24:05.040\nBut otherwise, we can generate it.\n\n1525\n01:24:05.040 --> 01:24:11.010\nI'm local to the machine, so if I do\nan SSH dash key scan of my own system,\n\n1526\n01:24:11.010 --> 01:24:15.650\nsince I'm right here, I know I'm not gonna\nget intercepted or anything like that.\n\n1527\n01:24:15.650 --> 01:24:19.005\nAnd so, I could run that scan against it,\nand generate it.\n\n1528\n01:24:19.005 --> 01:24:21.782\nAnd why did I get a connection reset?\n\n1529\n01:24:23.592 --> 01:24:25.630\nYou know what?\nI need to restart SSH.\n\n1530\n01:24:25.630 --> 01:24:27.050\nSSH is ticked off now.\n\n1531\n01:24:27.050 --> 01:24:30.664\nSo, I need to do service SSHD restart.\n\n1532\n01:24:32.750 --> 01:24:34.483\nThat's the other problem.\n\n1533\n01:24:34.483 --> 01:24:35.388\nYeah, that's not gonna work.\n\n1534\n01:24:35.388 --> 01:24:36.760\nLet me do a little SUDO action.\n\n1535\n01:24:36.760 --> 01:24:40.780\nI've gotten so\nused to not having to worry about it.\n\n1536\n01:24:40.780 --> 01:24:43.430\nCould not load ssh_host_dsa_key.\n\n1537\n01:24:43.430 --> 01:24:44.520\nDid I do a typo?\n\n1538\n01:24:44.520 --> 01:24:48.773\nssh_host_dsa_key.\n\n1539\n01:24:48.773 --> 01:24:54.706\nI wonder if there was an error on\nthe screen that I didn't notice?\n\n1540\n01:24:54.706 --> 01:25:01.539\n>> I think when I flashed by it looked\nlike it was successfully added in there.\n\n1541\n01:25:01.539 --> 01:25:03.632\n>> ssh_host_dsa_key.\n\n1542\n01:25:03.632 --> 01:25:05.670\nThere it is.\n\n1543\n01:25:05.670 --> 01:25:07.230\nI don't seem to have a typo.\n\n1544\n01:25:07.230 --> 01:25:09.124\nLet's just try that one more time.\n\n1545\n01:25:09.124 --> 01:25:11.520\nYeah, it's complaining\nabout just that one.\n\n1546\n01:25:11.520 --> 01:25:14.820\nWell, no,\nit's complaining about the RSA key, also.\n\n1547\n01:25:14.820 --> 01:25:16.660\nIt might be the pass phrase.\n\n1548\n01:25:16.660 --> 01:25:18.900\nMaybe it's not happy\nabout that pass phrase?\n\n1549\n01:25:18.900 --> 01:25:21.590\nI could have sworn you\ncould use a pass phrase.\n\n1550\n01:25:21.590 --> 01:25:23.858\nWell, we can always regenerate it,\n\n1551\n01:25:23.858 --> 01:25:27.161\nit's not that big of a deal\nto regenerate those keys.\n\n1552\n01:25:27.161 --> 01:25:33.221\nAnd, yeah, so, we'll just overwrite it.\n\n1553\n01:25:33.221 --> 01:25:35.321\nAll right.\nSo, there's that one.\n\n1554\n01:25:35.321 --> 01:25:38.107\nWe'll do RSA.\n\n1555\n01:25:39.987 --> 01:25:42.511\nWe'll find out right quick\nlike if that's the case.\n\n1556\n01:25:44.809 --> 01:25:46.330\nAnd then, we'll do DSA.\n\n1557\n01:25:53.238 --> 01:25:53.993\nAll right.\n\n1558\n01:25:57.278 --> 01:25:59.107\nAnd now, I'll just restart that service.\n\n1559\n01:26:02.185 --> 01:26:04.065\nThat's it,\nit doesn't support a passphrase.\n\n1560\n01:26:04.065 --> 01:26:07.105\nSo, there's probably a config file\nwe're gonna attach that passphrase to.\n\n1561\n01:26:07.105 --> 01:26:10.370\nBut, yeah, so, it was just unhappy about\nhaving a passphrase on those certificates.\n\n1562\n01:26:10.370 --> 01:26:11.120\nSo, there it goes.\n\n1563\n01:26:11.120 --> 01:26:12.101\nIt restarts.\n\n1564\n01:26:12.101 --> 01:26:15.143\nIf I try and SSH into myself, or\n\n1565\n01:26:15.143 --> 01:26:21.659\ndo the ssh-keyscan All right.\n\n1566\n01:26:21.659 --> 01:26:22.285\nThere it goes.\n\n1567\n01:26:22.285 --> 01:26:23.740\nThere's my new key.\n\n1568\n01:26:23.740 --> 01:26:24.370\nOkay?\n\n1569\n01:26:24.370 --> 01:26:27.660\nSo, I could copy that, and this is\nthe public key, not the private key.\n\n1570\n01:26:27.660 --> 01:26:29.040\nSo, it's okay to distribute this.\n\n1571\n01:26:29.040 --> 01:26:32.840\nIf an attacker gets this,\nthey can encrypt data to send to us, but\n\n1572\n01:26:32.840 --> 01:26:33.680\nthey can't decrypt it.\n\n1573\n01:26:33.680 --> 01:26:35.340\nSo, I'm not really worried about that.\n\n1574\n01:26:35.340 --> 01:26:38.390\nSo, I can send this public\nkey to my users, and\n\n1575\n01:26:38.390 --> 01:26:41.240\nI can say, hey, guys,\nreplace your known host entry for\n\n1576\n01:26:41.240 --> 01:26:44.910\nthe old server with this one because\nthese are the new values, okay?\n\n1577\n01:26:44.910 --> 01:26:48.440\nAnd so, they can go and add that in and\nget it put into their system.\n\n1578\n01:26:48.440 --> 01:26:49.290\nAnd then, it'll trust it.\n\n1579\n01:26:49.290 --> 01:26:52.060\nOtherwise, the next time they connect,\nwhat are they gonna get?\n\n1580\n01:26:52.060 --> 01:26:53.700\nThey're gonna get that warning.\n\n1581\n01:26:55.350 --> 01:27:02.300\nSo, if we go in here and say SSH dpezet@\nthey're gonna get a warning, right here.\n\n1582\n01:27:02.300 --> 01:27:03.340\nBig time warning.\n\n1583\n01:27:03.340 --> 01:27:06.000\nRemote host identification has changed.\n\n1584\n01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:09.160\nThe key no longer matches,\nare you sure this is what you want?\n\n1585\n01:27:09.160 --> 01:27:11.400\nSomeone could be eavesdropping\non you right now.\n\n1586\n01:27:11.400 --> 01:27:14.050\nYou have no idea the danger you are in,\nright?\n\n1587\n01:27:14.050 --> 01:27:16.660\nNational secrecy is at stake.\n\n1588\n01:27:16.660 --> 01:27:18.795\nAnd so, you can look at it and\nyou can say, all right,\n\n1589\n01:27:18.795 --> 01:27:23.085\nis that the new fingerprint, is that the\nright fingerprint for this certificate?\n\n1590\n01:27:23.085 --> 01:27:24.705\nAnd I don't really know.\n\n1591\n01:27:24.705 --> 01:27:27.005\nNotice, it didn't even give me the chance.\n\n1592\n01:27:27.005 --> 01:27:29.655\nIt immediately failed me and\nkicked me out.\n\n1593\n01:27:29.655 --> 01:27:32.050\nI don't even have the chance to say,\nyeah, I'll accept that.\n\n1594\n01:27:32.050 --> 01:27:32.650\nAll right.\n\n1595\n01:27:32.650 --> 01:27:37.920\nSo, what I really need to do is update\nmy known host with the new value.\n\n1596\n01:27:37.920 --> 01:27:43.274\nAnd so, I'm gonna go in here and\ndo the SSH key scan to import the new key.\n\n1597\n01:27:46.014 --> 01:27:50.224\nAnd we'll get that in there.\n\n1598\n01:27:50.224 --> 01:27:53.730\nAnd I'll just edit that file.\n\n1599\n01:27:53.730 --> 01:28:00.880\nSo I'm doing vi and going in to my\nown directory /.ssh /known_hosts.\n\n1600\n01:28:00.880 --> 01:28:05.330\nAnd I've now got two entries for that one\nand I'm just gonna delete the old entry.\n\n1601\n01:28:05.330 --> 01:28:11.910\nSo I've just got the new one and\nnow when I go to connect, it\n\n1602\n01:28:11.910 --> 01:28:15.010\ndoesn't even warn me about the certificate\ncuz I've already got the new one on file.\n\n1603\n01:28:15.010 --> 01:28:18.840\nSo pretty cool stuff there.\n\n1604\n01:28:18.840 --> 01:28:20.530\nNice to have it in place.\n\n1605\n01:28:20.530 --> 01:28:25.054\nAnother this is, as an admin, if you\ngot a lot of end-users on this station,\n\n1606\n01:28:25.054 --> 01:28:27.838\nyou might want to pre-setup some of these,\nand\n\n1607\n01:28:27.838 --> 01:28:32.084\nyou could do it like using the skeleton\nfolder when you create new users,\n\n1608\n01:28:32.084 --> 01:28:37.130\nit'll automatically come over or there is\na central repository if we get into /etc.\n\n1609\n01:28:39.937 --> 01:28:46.258\nLet's see it's /etc/ssh, and then in\nhere it doesn't exist by default but\n\n1610\n01:28:46.258 --> 01:28:50.948\nwe can make a file right in here\ncalled SSH Known Hosts, and\n\n1611\n01:28:50.948 --> 01:28:56.308\nif we put it here inside of /etc we\ncan actually put those keys in and\n\n1612\n01:28:56.308 --> 01:28:59.635\nit'll take effect for all of our users.\n\n1613\n01:28:59.635 --> 01:29:01.750\nJust a global key file.\n\n1614\n01:29:01.750 --> 01:29:04.987\nSo, by putting it here I might\nhave 500 users on my system,\n\n1615\n01:29:04.987 --> 01:29:07.435\nthey'll all now trust that key for\nthat host.\n\n1616\n01:29:07.435 --> 01:29:14.194\nSo that would just be\n/etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts_.\n\n1617\n01:29:14.194 --> 01:29:16.400\nNotice the variation in the file name.\n\n1618\n01:29:16.400 --> 01:29:19.410\nIn your user profile\nit's just known_hosts.\n\n1619\n01:29:19.410 --> 01:29:23.070\nBut here it's ssh_known_host so\nlittle variation but\n\n1620\n01:29:23.070 --> 01:29:25.050\nthe contents inside of it are the same.\n\n1621\n01:29:25.050 --> 01:29:29.019\nJust any key you put in here will be\nglobally trusted by all of the users\n\n1622\n01:29:29.019 --> 01:29:32.723\non your system versus the other\nones that are a per-user basis.\n\n1623\n01:29:35.478 --> 01:29:41.474\nNow that is a basic primer on how to\nuse SSH and how to secure the keys.\n\n1624\n01:29:41.474 --> 01:29:44.670\nI wanna show you something else\nthat's really cool about SSH but\n\n1625\n01:29:44.670 --> 01:29:48.050\nwe're out of time on this segment so\nlet's stop here and take a break, and\n\n1626\n01:29:48.050 --> 01:29:51.550\nwhen we get back I'm gonna show you\nanother neat trick we can do with SSH.\n\n1627\n01:29:51.550 --> 01:29:52.663\n>> Sweet.\n\n1628\n01:29:52.663 --> 01:30:00.193\n[MUSIC]\n\n1629\n01:30:00.193 --> 01:30:03.920\n>> So in the last segment we took a look\nat SSH and how it allowed us to get\n\n1630\n01:30:03.920 --> 01:30:08.650\na shell connection that was encrypted and\nthat's really what SSH was designed for,\n\n1631\n01:30:08.650 --> 01:30:12.712\nthat telnet was something we used so\nmuch and it was so unsecure that we had\n\n1632\n01:30:12.712 --> 01:30:17.200\nto have something better and so\nSSH was the replacement for it.\n\n1633\n01:30:17.200 --> 01:30:21.320\nThe cool thing is that SSH has\nevolved into much, much more,\n\n1634\n01:30:21.320 --> 01:30:27.440\nyou can use SSH to encrypt almost\nany network communication.\n\n1635\n01:30:27.440 --> 01:30:31.720\nWhat you can do is you can\ntake ports on your system, and\n\n1636\n01:30:31.720 --> 01:30:35.040\nyou can forward it though SSH.\n\n1637\n01:30:35.040 --> 01:30:37.260\nSo your basically using\nSSH to create tunnels,\n\n1638\n01:30:37.260 --> 01:30:39.450\nthey're like miniature VPN tunnels.\n\n1639\n01:30:39.450 --> 01:30:41.590\nThey're incredibly powerful,\nsuper awesome, and\n\n1640\n01:30:41.590 --> 01:30:44.660\na lot of people don't even know about it,\nbetter yet make use of it.\n\n1641\n01:30:44.660 --> 01:30:48.250\nSo when you SSH, what you're really\ndoing is, you're building a tunnel, and\n\n1642\n01:30:48.250 --> 01:30:50.690\nthen you're just sending\nyour shell data across it.\n\n1643\n01:30:50.690 --> 01:30:54.590\nBut you could take web traffic,\nFTP, anything, and\n\n1644\n01:30:54.590 --> 01:30:58.730\nsend it over that same exact tunnel\ngetting the same benefits of encryption\n\n1645\n01:30:58.730 --> 01:31:01.770\nout of it that you do out\nof your secure shell.\n\n1646\n01:31:01.770 --> 01:31:04.485\nSo, really cool stuff when\nwe take advantage of it.\n\n1647\n01:31:04.485 --> 01:31:09.914\nNow, one of the main uses for this is\nif we are forced, we have no choice,\n\n1648\n01:31:09.914 --> 01:31:15.105\nbut we're forced to use some\nkind of non-secure protocol.\n\n1649\n01:31:15.105 --> 01:31:18.135\nFor example,\nmaybe we have a software application that\n\n1650\n01:31:18.135 --> 01:31:23.825\njust hasn't been updated and\nit requires Telnet or it requires FTP.\n\n1651\n01:31:23.825 --> 01:31:28.500\nWell Telnet and FTP are non secure,\nthey transmit your data in plain text.\n\n1652\n01:31:28.500 --> 01:31:31.050\nSo, we can take that data and\n\n1653\n01:31:31.050 --> 01:31:36.080\nwe can ship it over our SSH tunnel and\nget the data across that way too.\n\n1654\n01:31:36.080 --> 01:31:38.090\nIt's really a pretty neat idea.\n\n1655\n01:31:39.360 --> 01:31:42.580\nLet's take for example Telnet.\n\n1656\n01:31:43.690 --> 01:31:47.650\nSo, I've gone ahead and enabled Telnet\non my server, so on my Linux server I\n\n1657\n01:31:47.650 --> 01:31:51.590\nam now running a little Telnet service and\nso somebody can Telnet into it.\n\n1658\n01:31:51.590 --> 01:31:59.200\nAnd if I jump over to my Mac,\nI can Telnet into 10.1.230.219 and\n\n1659\n01:31:59.200 --> 01:32:04.550\nI can login as dpezet, and\nI can punch in my password,\n\n1660\n01:32:04.550 --> 01:32:08.600\nboth of which were just sent\nacross the network in plain text.\n\n1661\n01:32:08.600 --> 01:32:11.820\nIf someone was running a sniffer, they\ncould have captured those packets, and\n\n1662\n01:32:11.820 --> 01:32:15.540\nit's right there, plain as day,\ndpezet and my password,\n\n1663\n01:32:15.540 --> 01:32:18.820\nwhich is the word password all lowercase,\nso they would've captured that,\n\n1664\n01:32:18.820 --> 01:32:20.330\nand they'd be laughing at me right now.\n\n1665\n01:32:20.330 --> 01:32:24.710\nBut not just that, as I start to do my\nwork, as I pull up a directory, and\n\n1666\n01:32:24.710 --> 01:32:29.450\nI change into that directory, everything\nthat I see on the screen, and everything\n\n1667\n01:32:29.450 --> 01:32:33.690\nthat I type is being transmitted in plain\ntext, so they're intercepting that too.\n\n1668\n01:32:33.690 --> 01:32:38.175\nSo what I can do is I can\nsay let me take that and\n\n1669\n01:32:38.175 --> 01:32:43.570\nfunnel that securely over SSH, and\nwe do it from the client's side.\n\n1670\n01:32:43.570 --> 01:32:48.490\nOn the client's side what we do is we\nbasically create like a port mapping,\n\n1671\n01:32:48.490 --> 01:32:53.760\nwe map a port and we say that this port\nfrom now on is go over this tunnel.\n\n1672\n01:32:53.760 --> 01:32:54.530\nIt's kinda neat.\n\n1673\n01:32:54.530 --> 01:32:57.800\nSo here,\nlet me get out of my Telnet session.\n\n1674\n01:32:57.800 --> 01:33:04.670\nAnd so I'm back here just on my Mac,\nand let me make that full screen.\n\n1675\n01:33:04.670 --> 01:33:06.000\nThere, okay.\n\n1676\n01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:10.300\nSo, I wanna take my Telnet session,\nand send it over SSH.\n\n1677\n01:33:10.300 --> 01:33:13.820\nI have to use Telnet,\nmy software application requires it, so\n\n1678\n01:33:13.820 --> 01:33:15.290\nI just want to tunnel it.\n\n1679\n01:33:15.290 --> 01:33:20.200\nSo, we run the SSH command but\nwe're gonna put some modifiers on it,\n\n1680\n01:33:20.200 --> 01:33:22.580\nwe're gonna change the way that it works.\n\n1681\n01:33:22.580 --> 01:33:25.590\nSo, I'm gonna first start off by\nsaying who it is I'm connecting to.\n\n1682\n01:33:25.590 --> 01:33:30.847\nAnd so, I'm gonna say dpezet@10.1.230.219\nthat's my Linux server,\n\n1683\n01:33:30.847 --> 01:33:35.205\nso that's who I'm gonna be connecting to.\n\n1684\n01:33:36.545 --> 01:33:40.675\nAnd then I need to say what my\nport mapping is going to be.\n\n1685\n01:33:40.675 --> 01:33:44.671\nSo I'm gonna say,\nmy local port is going to be,\n\n1686\n01:33:44.671 --> 01:33:48.660\nTelnet uses port 23, so\nI'm gonna pick some other port.\n\n1687\n01:33:48.660 --> 01:33:52.996\nSome port that'll be locally significant\nto me, I'm gonna pick 65023.\n\n1688\n01:33:52.996 --> 01:33:56.915\nI usually pick 65000 followed by\nwhatever the port number is that I\n\n1689\n01:33:56.915 --> 01:33:58.480\nwas gonna use anyway.\n\n1690\n01:33:58.480 --> 01:34:04.228\nSo, I'll do 65023, so\nthat's gonna be my local port.\n\n1691\n01:34:04.228 --> 01:34:08.179\nAnd then I need to specify\nthe remote host which\n\n1692\n01:34:08.179 --> 01:34:13.157\nwas 10.1.230.219 and then the remote port.\n\n1693\n01:34:13.157 --> 01:34:18.154\nSo, locally I'm mapping port 65023\n\n1694\n01:34:18.154 --> 01:34:23.385\non my end to port 23 on the other end.\n\n1695\n01:34:23.385 --> 01:34:29.985\nBut in between, it's going through\nmy SSH session to 10.1.230.219.\n\n1696\n01:34:29.985 --> 01:34:34.525\nSo on the left, that's my local port.\n\n1697\n01:34:34.525 --> 01:34:38.075\nOn the right, that's the remote port.\n\n1698\n01:34:38.075 --> 01:34:40.775\nThis is just the remote port for\nTelnet, in my case.\n\n1699\n01:34:42.850 --> 01:34:48.040\nAnd then I need to add /n to let it know\nthis is a new tunnel that's coming up,\n\n1700\n01:34:48.040 --> 01:34:49.740\nand I'll run that.\n\n1701\n01:34:49.740 --> 01:34:52.300\nIt's now building an SSH\nsession to the other side.\n\n1702\n01:34:52.300 --> 01:34:55.760\nSo it asks my password and\nI punch that in.\n\n1703\n01:34:55.760 --> 01:34:59.850\nAnd now I'm just right back to my,\nyou know what shoot,\n\n1704\n01:34:59.850 --> 01:35:04.320\nI just did all that and I'm on dadgummit,\nlet me get out of that.\n\n1705\n01:35:04.320 --> 01:35:04.960\nSorry, there we go.\n\n1706\n01:35:04.960 --> 01:35:08.865\nI wasn't on my Mac, I was SSH'd in,\nso I just SSH'd into myself.\n\n1707\n01:35:08.865 --> 01:35:10.940\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So let me repeat that.\n\n1708\n01:35:10.940 --> 01:35:13.990\nSo now, I'm actually on my Mac.\n\n1709\n01:35:13.990 --> 01:35:18.080\n[LAUGH] Sometimes I don't think\nthrough this stuff so much.\n\n1710\n01:35:18.080 --> 01:35:20.080\nSo I'm just gonna repeat\nthe whole process.\n\n1711\n01:35:20.080 --> 01:35:23.830\nI guess I could've copied and\npasted but I'm already committed.\n\n1712\n01:35:23.830 --> 01:35:25.920\nSo here, I'll do a different port just so\n\n1713\n01:35:25.920 --> 01:35:28.260\nwe know that it's not the command\nfrom earlier that's working.\n\n1714\n01:35:28.260 --> 01:35:31.096\nSo maybe I'll do 60023 this time.\n\n1715\n01:35:31.096 --> 01:35:39.895\nAnd the remote host, and the remote port.\n\n1716\n01:35:41.400 --> 01:35:43.650\nShoot, I changed the dadgum keys.\n\n1717\n01:35:43.650 --> 01:35:48.258\nI forgot about changing the keys.\n\n1718\n01:35:51.750 --> 01:35:54.240\nI'm just gonna get rid of\nmy known_hosts file here.\n\n1719\n01:35:56.791 --> 01:35:58.497\nWhich I can spell excellently.\n\n1720\n01:35:58.497 --> 01:36:00.370\nAll right, let's try that again.\n\n1721\n01:36:00.370 --> 01:36:05.300\nSo, I'm gonna build up that SSA session,\nI'll just say yes to accept the key.\n\n1722\n01:36:05.300 --> 01:36:07.250\nIt'll ask for my password.\n\n1723\n01:36:07.250 --> 01:36:08.720\nAnd now, notice my prompt.\n\n1724\n01:36:08.720 --> 01:36:10.470\nThis is what I was trying\nto say a moment ago.\n\n1725\n01:36:10.470 --> 01:36:11.690\nNotice my prompt.\n\n1726\n01:36:11.690 --> 01:36:15.190\nI just opened up an SSA session\nto the remote host, but\n\n1727\n01:36:15.190 --> 01:36:19.710\ninstead of getting me a shell,\nit just disappears.\n\n1728\n01:36:19.710 --> 01:36:22.220\nAnd now i'm still on Don's macro chrome.\n\n1729\n01:36:22.220 --> 01:36:23.440\nSo, i'm still here on this mac.\n\n1730\n01:36:23.440 --> 01:36:25.260\nWell, what happened?\n\n1731\n01:36:25.260 --> 01:36:29.900\nWhat happened is there is an active\nSSH session running between me and\n\n1732\n01:36:29.900 --> 01:36:31.440\nthe other host right now.\n\n1733\n01:36:31.440 --> 01:36:34.930\nBut what it's doing is\ninstead of giving me a shell.\n\n1734\n01:36:34.930 --> 01:36:40.930\nIt is mapping my local port 600023 to that\n\n1735\n01:36:40.930 --> 01:36:47.280\nremote port of 23 via this tunnel\nthat I no longer directly see.\n\n1736\n01:36:47.280 --> 01:36:51.992\nAll right, so\nif I run Telnet to 10.1.230.119,\n\n1737\n01:36:51.992 --> 01:36:57.980\nthat's gonna do a unencrypted,\nnon-secure Telnet session to that server.\n\n1738\n01:36:59.040 --> 01:37:04.396\nBut if I Telnet to, 127.0.0.1\n\n1739\n01:37:04.396 --> 01:37:10.234\non port 60023 I'm to myself.\n\n1740\n01:37:10.234 --> 01:37:15.557\nAnd I'm to myself on 60023 which is mapped\n\n1741\n01:37:15.557 --> 01:37:21.913\nto go over my ssh tunnel and\nconnect to the remote side on port23.\n\n1742\n01:37:21.913 --> 01:37:22.679\nAll right.\n\n1743\n01:37:22.679 --> 01:37:28.920\nWhen I run that, I see a log in prompt\nthat's coming from the other server.\n\n1744\n01:37:28.920 --> 01:37:30.030\nAnd I can log in.\n\n1745\n01:37:31.220 --> 01:37:34.150\nIt, I forgot my password.\n\n1746\n01:37:35.550 --> 01:37:40.580\nThere we go and\nnow I'm at dpezet@dp-Linux.\n\n1747\n01:37:40.580 --> 01:37:44.650\nI'm logged into that Linux machine,\nand I'm logged in using\n\n1748\n01:37:44.650 --> 01:37:50.010\ntelnet which is non-secure, but\nit is being tunneled over ssh.\n\n1749\n01:37:50.010 --> 01:37:52.370\nSo if somebody's running\na sniffer on the network,\n\n1750\n01:37:52.370 --> 01:37:54.760\nall they see is encrypted SSH traffic.\n\n1751\n01:37:54.760 --> 01:37:56.150\nThey don't even know what's telling that.\n\n1752\n01:37:56.150 --> 01:37:58.760\nThey have no idea what I'm\nsending over that tunnel.\n\n1753\n01:37:58.760 --> 01:38:03.290\nThey just see SSH traffic on port 22,\ncuz that's what SSH uses.\n\n1754\n01:38:03.290 --> 01:38:09.110\nYou can tunnel any TCP\ncommunication across SSH, right?\n\n1755\n01:38:09.110 --> 01:38:12.000\nSo, a lot of the old protocols like FTP,\n\n1756\n01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:17.350\nwell you have SFTP which is just FTP\nover SSH, that's how they secure it.\n\n1757\n01:38:17.350 --> 01:38:19.480\nAnd there's even ones like POP3 and\n\n1758\n01:38:19.480 --> 01:38:23.910\nIMAP where they have map and\ns pop three with s's before it.\n\n1759\n01:38:23.910 --> 01:38:25.790\nWhen the s is before it\nthat means its using SSH.\n\n1760\n01:38:25.790 --> 01:38:31.800\nWhen the s is after it like s mtp s that's\nusing SSL or TSL so that's different.\n\n1761\n01:38:31.800 --> 01:38:35.460\nBut a lot of them are just\nslapped on top of SSH.\n\n1762\n01:38:35.460 --> 01:38:37.800\nSo right now I've got\nthis tunnel in place.\n\n1763\n01:38:37.800 --> 01:38:42.800\nAnd I'm now able to make\na non-secure protocol secure.\n\n1764\n01:38:42.800 --> 01:38:43.390\nRight.\n\n1765\n01:38:43.390 --> 01:38:46.766\nAnd if that remote system is at my home or\nsomewhere where I've got a firewall\n\n1766\n01:38:46.766 --> 01:38:49.374\nin between it,\nI only have to open up one port, Port 22.\n\n1767\n01:38:49.374 --> 01:38:51.900\nI have to open up the SSH port.\n\n1768\n01:38:51.900 --> 01:38:57.580\nAnd then I can tunnel whatever I\nwant across it, without the need of\n\n1769\n01:38:57.580 --> 01:39:00.450\ngoing through and specifying all\nsorts of crazy stuff, right?\n\n1770\n01:39:00.450 --> 01:39:02.440\nI can just pass right\nthrough on that single port\n\n1771\n01:39:03.670 --> 01:39:05.450\nall my communications\nbeing tunneled over it.\n\n1772\n01:39:05.450 --> 01:39:11.080\nThe weird part is that when I wanna\ntelnet, I have to telnet to myself, right?\n\n1773\n01:39:11.080 --> 01:39:12.210\nThat's a little bit weird.\n\n1774\n01:39:12.210 --> 01:39:13.920\nThat you're telling it to yourself.\n\n1775\n01:39:13.920 --> 01:39:16.330\nBut it's because you've\ngot that local port\n\n1776\n01:39:16.330 --> 01:39:18.530\nmapped to that remote\nport on the other side.\n\n1777\n01:39:18.530 --> 01:39:19.990\nAnd you can map more than one port.\n\n1778\n01:39:19.990 --> 01:39:24.070\nYou just keep opening up additional SSH\nsessions, and do the mapping that way.\n\n1779\n01:39:24.070 --> 01:39:27.050\nMapping each port to that remote host.\n\n1780\n01:39:27.050 --> 01:39:30.030\nSo, cool functionality, really powerful.\n\n1781\n01:39:30.030 --> 01:39:34.810\nI showed an even better use of this,\nin the graphical interface user episode.\n\n1782\n01:39:34.810 --> 01:39:36.570\nIf you haven't watched it yet,\nrun over there and\n\n1783\n01:39:36.570 --> 01:39:40.350\ncheck it out, because there's\nactually another option with SSH,\n\n1784\n01:39:40.350 --> 01:39:46.080\nbecause if you add a -y or -x to the ssh\n\n1785\n01:39:46.080 --> 01:39:51.380\ncommand that says that you're gonna be\nsending x windows forwarding across it.\n\n1786\n01:39:51.380 --> 01:39:55.730\nAnd you can actually run applications\nacross the ssh session so it's nice and\n\n1787\n01:39:55.730 --> 01:39:56.740\nencrypted.\n\n1788\n01:39:56.740 --> 01:40:01.405\nI did that during the show and\nI used -y in that show and the reason is,\n\n1789\n01:40:01.405 --> 01:40:06.860\n-x is the old way and it basically\nruns things on the other side with\n\n1790\n01:40:06.860 --> 01:40:12.810\nelevated system privileges, like a root,\nand so it's not terribly secure.\n\n1791\n01:40:12.810 --> 01:40:16.320\nYour session's encrypted but your software\nis running in a non-secure manner,\n\n1792\n01:40:16.320 --> 01:40:17.855\nit's running with elevated privileges.\n\n1793\n01:40:17.855 --> 01:40:22.460\n-y makes it run under the privileges\nof your individual user account and\n\n1794\n01:40:22.460 --> 01:40:26.290\nit's now running with the right\nuser id and it's much safer, right.\n\n1795\n01:40:26.290 --> 01:40:29.540\nThey can still open up a shell and do sudo\nor whatever if they have permission for\n\n1796\n01:40:29.540 --> 01:40:33.630\nit, but those x Windows applications are\nrunning as so -y is what we normally use.\n\n1797\n01:40:33.630 --> 01:40:39.150\nIf you want to see that in action jump\nover to GUI episode it's in there.\n\n1798\n01:40:39.150 --> 01:40:44.330\nAll right so really cool stuff that\nwe can do with ssh, really powerful,\n\n1799\n01:40:44.330 --> 01:40:49.170\nit's not just a shell program,\nit's also a tunnel,\n\n1800\n01:40:49.170 --> 01:40:53.365\nbasically a mini VPN tunnel we\ncan use to redirect traffic over.\n\n1801\n01:40:53.365 --> 01:40:58.030\nAnd, in my notes and\nwhich I'll post with the episode.\n\n1802\n01:40:58.030 --> 01:41:00.390\nI actually go a little bit further.\n\n1803\n01:41:00.390 --> 01:41:05.490\nWhere is that in my notes,\nsomewhere in here, right here, so\n\n1804\n01:41:05.490 --> 01:41:11.260\nin my notes I actually show how to install\nthe telnet server and set that up and\n\n1805\n01:41:11.260 --> 01:41:14.340\npoke a hole in the firewall if\nyou've got IP tables turned on.\n\n1806\n01:41:14.340 --> 01:41:17.290\nBut I've got that same information\nright here that you can use.\n\n1807\n01:41:17.290 --> 01:41:20.780\nI think I used a different IP address and\ndifferent port number in my notes but\n\n1808\n01:41:20.780 --> 01:41:24.170\nyou can go through and do it and kind of\nrecreate this on your end if you want.\n\n1809\n01:41:24.170 --> 01:41:27.070\nIt's really neat, it's fun to mess with.\n\n1810\n01:41:30.130 --> 01:41:34.770\nAll right so,\nspeaking of security and keys right?\n\n1811\n01:41:34.770 --> 01:41:36.330\nWhen we send data like this,\n\n1812\n01:41:36.330 --> 01:41:39.920\na live communication, we can encrypt\nit with SSH and it's done live.\n\n1813\n01:41:39.920 --> 01:41:42.320\nWhat if it's something\nthat is time shifted?\n\n1814\n01:41:42.320 --> 01:41:45.320\nFor example,\nI'm gonna send an email to Nate.\n\n1815\n01:41:45.320 --> 01:41:48.080\nAnd the email needs to go\nthrough my email servers.\n\n1816\n01:41:48.080 --> 01:41:51.600\nIt needs to go trhoug SMTP which really\ndoesn't have great encryption at all.\n\n1817\n01:41:51.600 --> 01:41:54.960\nAnd I'm sending it now, but\nI don't know when Nate's gonna open it.\n\n1818\n01:41:54.960 --> 01:41:57.990\nAnd I need to make sure that\nit's encrypted and secured, and\n\n1819\n01:41:57.990 --> 01:42:02.800\nthat only Nate can open it, and not some\nemail server administrator or whatever.\n\n1820\n01:42:02.800 --> 01:42:08.070\nThe problem with SSH is,\nit is not end to end encryption.\n\n1821\n01:42:08.070 --> 01:42:11.520\nIn other words, if I send an email\nto Nate, and I send it over SSH,\n\n1822\n01:42:11.520 --> 01:42:16.660\nthe email's unencrypted on my system,\nand it's unencrypted on his system too.\n\n1823\n01:42:16.660 --> 01:42:20.920\nIn transit it's secure, but\non our endpoints it's not secure.\n\n1824\n01:42:20.920 --> 01:42:25.910\nSo if I want end to end encryption,\nSSH is not a solution for me.\n\n1825\n01:42:25.910 --> 01:42:29.070\nI can use something else, like PGP,\n\n1826\n01:42:29.070 --> 01:42:34.180\nwhich is pretty good privacy, that's\na private closed source, for pay product.\n\n1827\n01:42:34.180 --> 01:42:41.880\nOr, GPG, which is GNU privacy guard,\nwhich is the open source version of PGP.\n\n1828\n01:42:41.880 --> 01:42:45.550\nWhat it allows you to do is to\ntake files and encrypt them.\n\n1829\n01:42:45.550 --> 01:42:49.230\nAnd then you can transmit them, transmit\nthem via email, ftp, whatever you want,\n\n1830\n01:42:49.230 --> 01:42:50.010\nbecause they're encrypted.\n\n1831\n01:42:50.010 --> 01:42:51.560\nAnd when they get sent to the other end,\n\n1832\n01:42:51.560 --> 01:42:54.810\nand they're sitting there waiting in\nsomebody's inbox, they're still encrypted.\n\n1833\n01:42:54.810 --> 01:42:57.700\nThey're encrypted until the moment\nthat user takes them and\n\n1834\n01:42:57.700 --> 01:43:00.470\nuses your key to open it up, all right?\n\n1835\n01:43:00.470 --> 01:43:03.890\nSo it gives you true\nend to end encryption.\n\n1836\n01:43:03.890 --> 01:43:06.950\nAdministrators, people like that, that\nare in the middle of that communication,\n\n1837\n01:43:06.950 --> 01:43:08.940\nwon't be able to interpret it.\n\n1838\n01:43:08.940 --> 01:43:11.600\nGpg is a great utility for doing that and\n\n1839\n01:43:11.600 --> 01:43:14.420\nit's really the only\nencryption you can trust.\n\n1840\n01:43:14.420 --> 01:43:17.088\nWhen you do something like Gmail, right?\n\n1841\n01:43:17.088 --> 01:43:19.763\nIf I use Gmail,\nwhen I connect to their web server,\n\n1842\n01:43:19.763 --> 01:43:24.121\nGoogle requires that I use SSL and they're\nusing SSL with their key and I think it's\n\n1843\n01:43:24.121 --> 01:43:27.940\npretty well known at this point that\nthey've given their key to the NSA.\n\n1844\n01:43:27.940 --> 01:43:32.891\nAnd so the NSA, the National Security\nAdministration here in the US they're\n\n1845\n01:43:32.891 --> 01:43:37.930\nable to intercept my Gmail communications\nand decrypt them in real time.\n\n1846\n01:43:37.930 --> 01:43:43.100\nIt's not even a challenge for their\nCPU because they have the private key.\n\n1847\n01:43:43.100 --> 01:43:46.630\nSo you cannot trust the keys\nprovided to you by public systems,\n\n1848\n01:43:46.630 --> 01:43:48.436\nthat's just how it is, right?\n\n1849\n01:43:48.436 --> 01:43:51.589\nBut with gpg you make your own key.\n\n1850\n01:43:51.589 --> 01:43:55.218\nYou make your own key and then you\ntransmit your encrypted data through other\n\n1851\n01:43:55.218 --> 01:43:59.220\npeople's systems and if somebody\nintercepts it, they don't have your key.\n\n1852\n01:43:59.220 --> 01:44:02.430\nSo somebody like Google can't turn\nit over to the NSA because they\n\n1853\n01:44:02.430 --> 01:44:03.230\ndon't have the key.\n\n1854\n01:44:03.230 --> 01:44:05.330\nIt was encrypted before it even got there.\n\n1855\n01:44:05.330 --> 01:44:07.190\nThat's how services like LastPass work.\n\n1856\n01:44:07.190 --> 01:44:09.800\nThat's why you can trust\nLastPass to store your passwords.\n\n1857\n01:44:09.800 --> 01:44:12.250\nBecause you're using your own key.\n\n1858\n01:44:12.250 --> 01:44:14.370\nThey don't have it,\nthey can't see your data.\n\n1859\n01:44:14.370 --> 01:44:17.850\nSo, gpg provides you that functionality.\n\n1860\n01:44:17.850 --> 01:44:20.260\nA lot of people don't know about the\nsoftware, a lot of people don't use it,\n\n1861\n01:44:20.260 --> 01:44:21.100\nand they really should.\n\n1862\n01:44:21.100 --> 01:44:24.480\nIt's free, and\nit's really not that bad to use.\n\n1863\n01:44:24.480 --> 01:44:28.789\nIt's not necessarily the easiest thing in\nthe world but it's not that bad either.\n\n1864\n01:44:28.789 --> 01:44:33.956\n>> So so you know,\n>> So you used email as your example.\n\n1865\n01:44:33.956 --> 01:44:37.390\nBut can you encrypt other things with it,\n\n1866\n01:44:37.390 --> 01:44:42.110\nlike images, or a video,\nor just text documents.\n\n1867\n01:44:42.110 --> 01:44:42.697\nOf that sort?\n\n1868\n01:44:42.697 --> 01:44:43.555\n>> Anything.\n\n1869\n01:44:43.555 --> 01:44:44.868\n>> Anything?\n>> Anything you want,\n\n1870\n01:44:44.868 --> 01:44:46.190\nyou can encrypt with GPG.\n\n1871\n01:44:46.190 --> 01:44:46.760\n>> All right.\n\n1872\n01:44:46.760 --> 01:44:51.070\n>> Yeah, it can encrypt files, it can also\njust encrypt raw text that you feed to it.\n\n1873\n01:44:51.070 --> 01:44:52.910\nSo it can encrypt really anything.\n\n1874\n01:44:52.910 --> 01:44:54.800\nYeah, it's really, really powerful stuff.\n\n1875\n01:44:54.800 --> 01:44:58.720\nBut the way it works is a little\ncomplex for most users.\n\n1876\n01:44:58.720 --> 01:45:02.850\nYou have to create a key, and your key,\nyou'll have a private key and\n\n1877\n01:45:02.850 --> 01:45:04.530\na public key, right?\n\n1878\n01:45:04.530 --> 01:45:07.940\nAnd so, when somebody wants\nto transmit something to you,\n\n1879\n01:45:07.940 --> 01:45:11.710\nthey need to have your public key and\nthey encrypt using your public key and\n\n1880\n01:45:11.710 --> 01:45:15.540\nthen they send it to you and\nyou use your private key to decrypt it.\n\n1881\n01:45:15.540 --> 01:45:18.640\nSo, the person on the other end\nhas to have your public key,\n\n1882\n01:45:18.640 --> 01:45:20.410\nyou've gotta give it to them.\n\n1883\n01:45:20.410 --> 01:45:24.110\nAnd then, if you wanna send stuff to them,\nyou need to have their public key, so\n\n1884\n01:45:24.110 --> 01:45:25.610\nthere needs to be a key exchange.\n\n1885\n01:45:25.610 --> 01:45:29.900\nSo both parties have to be aware of it,\nboth parties have to have keys and\n\n1886\n01:45:29.900 --> 01:45:31.720\nthey have to exchange their public keys.\n\n1887\n01:45:31.720 --> 01:45:34.350\nMost people aren't doing that.\n\n1888\n01:45:34.350 --> 01:45:37.670\nMost people don't have keys,\nthey don't exchange them, so\n\n1889\n01:45:37.670 --> 01:45:41.340\nit does require basically intelligent\npeople on both ends, right?\n\n1890\n01:45:41.340 --> 01:45:43.071\nAnd that sometimes is not what happens.\n\n1891\n01:45:43.071 --> 01:45:43.600\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n1892\n01:45:43.600 --> 01:45:44.710\n[LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n1893\n01:45:44.710 --> 01:45:47.780\nif we wanna make use of it though,\nwe need to do just that.\n\n1894\n01:45:47.780 --> 01:45:48.930\nSo let's get started with GPG.\n\n1895\n01:45:48.930 --> 01:45:51.640\nLet's get it installed and\nwe'll create some keys and\n\n1896\n01:45:51.640 --> 01:45:53.370\nthen we'll show an example\nif how it works.\n\n1897\n01:45:53.370 --> 01:45:53.930\n>> Nice.\n\n1898\n01:45:53.930 --> 01:45:54.550\n>> All right.\n\n1899\n01:45:54.550 --> 01:45:57.620\n>> So, to get started, I'm probably\ngonna have to install it because\n\n1900\n01:45:57.620 --> 01:46:00.700\nit's not normally installed\nwith most systems.\n\n1901\n01:46:00.700 --> 01:46:03.210\nI can find out if I do a yum list.\n\n1902\n01:46:03.210 --> 01:46:06.720\n>> gpg, which actually, I'm on my Mac,\nthat's not gonna help me.\n\n1903\n01:46:06.720 --> 01:46:10.100\nLet me get over here, sudo yum list gpg.\n\n1904\n01:46:12.810 --> 01:46:13.580\nAll right.\n\n1905\n01:46:13.580 --> 01:46:17.200\nAnd when I come in here and look, I'll\nprobably find that you need to install it,\n\n1906\n01:46:17.200 --> 01:46:19.520\nlet's see It's taking its time.\n\n1907\n01:46:19.520 --> 01:46:22.659\nNo matching packages, that doesn't help.\n\n1908\n01:46:24.947 --> 01:46:26.570\nIs it built in?\n\n1909\n01:46:26.570 --> 01:46:28.290\nIt is, look at that!\n\n1910\n01:46:28.290 --> 01:46:30.450\nHm, all right, so it's already built in.\n\n1911\n01:46:30.450 --> 01:46:32.650\nSo it's pre-installed here in CentOS.\n\n1912\n01:46:32.650 --> 01:46:35.670\nThat's why I'm not finding a package for\nit.\n\n1913\n01:46:35.670 --> 01:46:37.660\n>> If I wanted, I can go and install it.\n\n1914\n01:46:37.660 --> 01:46:39.810\nNow, there is gonna be a little problem.\n\n1915\n01:46:39.810 --> 01:46:42.520\nWhen I run it,\nsee how I just ran GPG by itself, and\n\n1916\n01:46:42.520 --> 01:46:44.374\nnow it's getting all complainy on me?\n\n1917\n01:46:44.374 --> 01:46:47.930\n[LAUGH] What's going on is it's\nshowing that I'm missing my keys.\n\n1918\n01:46:47.930 --> 01:46:52.310\nI get warning, keys aren't there,\n>> Things are not yet active.\n\n1919\n01:46:52.310 --> 01:46:55.710\nIt is creating some config files for me.\n\n1920\n01:46:55.710 --> 01:46:58.650\nAnd now it's asking me to type\na message for it to secure.\n\n1921\n01:46:58.650 --> 01:47:02.300\nBut it's basically not really working,\nso i'm just gonna break out of that.\n\n1922\n01:47:02.300 --> 01:47:05.330\nCuz it's not working yet,\nwe need to get it set up.\n\n1923\n01:47:05.330 --> 01:47:08.130\nSo if GPG is already installed for\nyou, great.\n\n1924\n01:47:08.130 --> 01:47:10.530\nI am curious why that\npackage didn't install,\n\n1925\n01:47:10.530 --> 01:47:13.760\nlet me do a little bit of a wildcard.\n\n1926\n01:47:15.390 --> 01:47:19.130\nSo I guess we've got gpgme, the package\nname is a little bit different.\n\n1927\n01:47:19.130 --> 01:47:20.460\nBut it's already installed,\n\n1928\n01:47:20.460 --> 01:47:24.970\nI can see it right there,\ngpgme.x86_64 is already installed.\n\n1929\n01:47:27.030 --> 01:47:27.840\nAll right.\n\n1930\n01:47:27.840 --> 01:47:29.840\nSo if I wanna work with it.\n\n1931\n01:47:29.840 --> 01:47:32.340\nThe first thing I need to do\nis I need to generate a key.\n\n1932\n01:47:32.340 --> 01:47:35.377\nNow I am logged in as dpezet right now.\n\n1933\n01:47:35.377 --> 01:47:37.090\nAnd if I want somebody\nto encrypt something and\n\n1934\n01:47:37.090 --> 01:47:38.550\nsend it to me they're\ngonna need my public key.\n\n1935\n01:47:38.550 --> 01:47:40.090\nSo I need to create one.\n\n1936\n01:47:40.090 --> 01:47:47.061\nCreating a key, we just run gpg --gen.\n\n1937\n01:47:47.061 --> 01:47:48.455\nJeez, key.\n\n1938\n01:47:48.455 --> 01:47:49.827\nThe hardest part is saying this stuff.\n\n1939\n01:47:49.827 --> 01:47:57.290\nGpg --gen-key and when I run that it's\ngonna ask what kind of key I want.\n\n1940\n01:47:57.290 --> 01:48:02.230\nThe default is RSA with RSA signatures and\nthat's usually what we want but\n\n1941\n01:48:02.230 --> 01:48:03.990\nyou can pick from some of the other ones.\n\n1942\n01:48:03.990 --> 01:48:06.289\nI'll stick with the default which is RSA.\n\n1943\n01:48:07.360 --> 01:48:08.950\nAll right, then the keysize.\n\n1944\n01:48:08.950 --> 01:48:12.290\nThe default is 2048 bit,\nthat's pretty secure.\n\n1945\n01:48:12.290 --> 01:48:16.110\nIt would take over 1 billion years for\na single computer to break that,\n\n1946\n01:48:16.110 --> 01:48:18.410\nso it's pretty reliable.\n\n1947\n01:48:18.410 --> 01:48:19.080\nI'll stick with that.\n\n1948\n01:48:20.390 --> 01:48:23.310\nAnd then,\nwhen do I want the key to expire, right?\n\n1949\n01:48:23.310 --> 01:48:25.050\nI recommend expiring it every year.\n\n1950\n01:48:25.050 --> 01:48:27.170\nBut because you have to\ndo key exchanges and\n\n1951\n01:48:27.170 --> 01:48:31.170\nstuff that can be frustrating sometimes,\nso you might wanna set it to never expire.\n\n1952\n01:48:31.170 --> 01:48:34.470\nBut, if the key expires after a certain\nperiod of time, then your data is gonna\n\n1953\n01:48:34.470 --> 01:48:38.080\nbe more secure because that's gonna\nmake you rotate out your keys.\n\n1954\n01:48:38.080 --> 01:48:40.090\nSo, you can could in and\nspecify a number of years.\n\n1955\n01:48:40.090 --> 01:48:41.360\nI could say 1y.\n\n1956\n01:48:41.360 --> 01:48:43.470\nAnd that would make it 1y.\n\n1957\n01:48:43.470 --> 01:48:45.230\nIf you set it to 0,\nit would just never expire.\n\n1958\n01:48:47.520 --> 01:48:49.310\nSo it's now telling me\nwhen it's gonna expire.\n\n1959\n01:48:49.310 --> 01:48:51.030\nl'll accept that.\n\n1960\n01:48:51.030 --> 01:48:54.040\nAnd now to build this certificate\nit needs to know my full name.\n\n1961\n01:48:54.040 --> 01:48:55.790\nI'll put in Don Pezet.\n\n1962\n01:48:55.790 --> 01:48:58.806\nAnd my email address don@itpro.tv and\na comment, right.\n\n1963\n01:48:58.806 --> 01:49:00.156\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n1964\n01:49:00.156 --> 01:49:05.580\nthe comment is just kinda\nlike a description.\n\n1965\n01:49:05.580 --> 01:49:08.400\nYou normally put in just\nsomething that says who you are.\n\n1966\n01:49:08.400 --> 01:49:10.910\nSo I might put host ITProTV.\n\n1967\n01:49:12.730 --> 01:49:14.270\nAll right, so now it's gonna create it.\n\n1968\n01:49:14.270 --> 01:49:15.070\nI'm okay with that.\n\n1969\n01:49:17.990 --> 01:49:20.340\nAnd now the key needs to be secured.\n\n1970\n01:49:20.340 --> 01:49:22.480\nRemember I showed you guys\nthis when we were doing SSH.\n\n1971\n01:49:22.480 --> 01:49:24.300\nWe need to put a passphrase on there,\n\n1972\n01:49:24.300 --> 01:49:26.800\nthat way if somebody gets\nahold of my private keyfile.\n\n1973\n01:49:26.800 --> 01:49:27.750\nThey won't be able to open it.\n\n1974\n01:49:27.750 --> 01:49:31.360\nSo I'll punch in a pass phrase, which\nis gonna be an incredibly secure one.\n\n1975\n01:49:33.970 --> 01:49:35.370\nNormally I do use a secure one here.\n\n1976\n01:49:35.370 --> 01:49:36.410\nIt's just complaining.\n\n1977\n01:49:36.410 --> 01:49:37.630\nAnd now the hard part.\n\n1978\n01:49:37.630 --> 01:49:40.140\nIt says we need to generate\na lot of random bytes.\n\n1979\n01:49:40.140 --> 01:49:42.680\nIf you're in the graphical user interface,\n\n1980\n01:49:42.680 --> 01:49:46.100\nyou can just move your mouse around on\nthe screen, and it doesn't take long for\n\n1981\n01:49:46.100 --> 01:49:49.830\nit to actually kick things in and\ngenerate it.\n\n1982\n01:49:49.830 --> 01:49:54.570\nFrom the command line interface,\nall you can do is type and you have to\n\n1983\n01:49:54.570 --> 01:49:59.680\ntype thousands of letters for it to have\nenough to generate random information.\n\n1984\n01:49:59.680 --> 01:50:00.731\nAll right, takes forever.\n\n1985\n01:50:00.731 --> 01:50:05.331\nSo what I like to do is jump\nover to another tty and\n\n1986\n01:50:05.331 --> 01:50:10.230\njust generate a lot of system activity,\nokay.\n\n1987\n01:50:10.230 --> 01:50:12.920\nA great way to generate\nsystem activity is to try and\n\n1988\n01:50:12.920 --> 01:50:16.600\ngenerate like an md5 key for\nyour entire hard drive.\n\n1989\n01:50:16.600 --> 01:50:21.330\nSo if I try and\ndo something like this m-d5sum/dev/sda,\n\n1990\n01:50:21.330 --> 01:50:26.740\ngenerating and MD5 sum for your entire\nhard drive generates a ton of activity and\n\n1991\n01:50:26.740 --> 01:50:31.160\nit will not take long for this guy\nto be happy and have enough entropy.\n\n1992\n01:50:31.160 --> 01:50:34.420\nSo, if we just give that a second,\nit should be enough.\n\n1993\n01:50:34.420 --> 01:50:38.710\nIn the GUI world, you just wave\nyour mouse around on the screen and\n\n1994\n01:50:38.710 --> 01:50:41.550\nthat'll do it, right, and it'll generate\npretty fast, cuz every time you move\n\n1995\n01:50:41.550 --> 01:50:45.170\nthe mouse the coordinates are changing,\nso it gets tons of information.\n\n1996\n01:50:45.170 --> 01:50:49.530\nBut here in this, when I'm in the command\nline or whatever, it's hard to generate\n\n1997\n01:50:49.530 --> 01:50:52.940\nthat activity, especially on a machine\nlike mine that's not in production use.\n\n1998\n01:50:52.940 --> 01:50:55.055\nNobody else is messing with this thing.\n\n1999\n01:50:55.055 --> 01:51:01.310\nSome of the other things you can\ndo to generate that activity,\n\n2000\n01:51:01.310 --> 01:51:08.299\nI might just log into another screen here,\nand do, like, ls -R /.\n\n2001\n01:51:08.299 --> 01:51:09.475\nAnd even LA, and\n\n2002\n01:51:09.475 --> 01:51:14.270\nthat's gonna start generating file\nlists of my entire hard drive.\n\n2003\n01:51:14.270 --> 01:51:16.770\nThat's gonna generate a lot of activity.\n\n2004\n01:51:16.770 --> 01:51:19.081\nSo as I do that, we can get a chance.\n\n2005\n01:51:19.081 --> 01:51:24.328\nSo here, it's complaining it didn't\nget enough bytes apparently.\n\n2006\n01:51:24.328 --> 01:51:27.190\nI wonder if I have to\nrun that md5sum as me.\n\n2007\n01:51:27.190 --> 01:51:30.290\nSo I'm running that other one as root,\nso it might not be counting that one.\n\n2008\n01:51:30.290 --> 01:51:33.220\nBut that directory listing\nwas running as me.\n\n2009\n01:51:33.220 --> 01:51:38.770\nLet me see if it will let me do this as,\n\n2010\n01:51:39.850 --> 01:51:42.700\nyeah, as a non root user,\nit's not gonna let me do that.\n\n2011\n01:51:42.700 --> 01:51:45.220\nWell, I guess I can keep\ndoing the directory thing.\n\n2012\n01:51:45.220 --> 01:51:46.733\nJust you've got to generate that activity.\n\n2013\n01:51:46.733 --> 01:51:50.863\nI know, some of our viewers are gonna have\nseizures now cuz this stuff is flashing by\n\n2014\n01:51:50.863 --> 01:51:54.700\nBut let's see if I can just generate\nenough activity to get this thing happy.\n\n2015\n01:51:55.790 --> 01:52:00.670\nThis is one problem in the gy it is super\neasy command line more challenging.\n\n2016\n01:52:00.670 --> 01:52:02.800\nThat thing's still running.\n\n2017\n01:52:04.780 --> 01:52:07.125\nI guess I could be sitting here typing.\n\n2018\n01:52:07.125 --> 01:52:08.797\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n2019\n01:52:08.797 --> 01:52:11.610\nthen I hit all my crazy Mac shortcuts.\n\n2020\n01:52:13.330 --> 01:52:14.887\nThat's not what I want.\n\n2021\n01:52:17.524 --> 01:52:18.347\nIt got it.\n\n2022\n01:52:18.347 --> 01:52:22.120\nThere we go, so sorry I'm typing it and\nin the meantime I got it.\n\n2023\n01:52:22.120 --> 01:52:24.440\nSo, eventually you do generate\nenough characters, and\n\n2024\n01:52:24.440 --> 01:52:25.650\nyou'll see this message right here.\n\n2025\n01:52:25.650 --> 01:52:28.750\nPublic and\nsecret keys generated and signed.\n\n2026\n01:52:28.750 --> 01:52:31.560\nAnd it's created it, and it's giving\nme that fingerprint right there.\n\n2027\n01:52:31.560 --> 01:52:34.950\nThat key finger print for\nthe stibia that I just generated.\n\n2028\n01:52:34.950 --> 01:52:37.230\nSo, sorry about all the goofy\nstuff ont he screen there.\n\n2029\n01:52:37.230 --> 01:52:38.695\nI can go and stop this MD5 sum.\n\n2030\n01:52:38.695 --> 01:52:41.660\nIt'll take hours for\nthat MD5 sum to generate.\n\n2031\n01:52:41.660 --> 01:52:43.390\nSo I'm just gonna stop that.\n\n2032\n01:52:43.390 --> 01:52:46.380\nAnd this one's already done, okay.\n\n2033\n01:52:46.380 --> 01:52:50.220\nSo now I've got a certificate generated.\n\n2034\n01:52:50.220 --> 01:52:53.340\nSorry, it was typing in all the extra\njunk that I did after it had finished\n\n2035\n01:52:53.340 --> 01:52:55.080\ngenerating it.\n\n2036\n01:52:55.080 --> 01:52:59.440\nNow once we've got the key,\nnow we're really ready to get going.\n\n2037\n01:52:59.440 --> 01:53:05.270\nAnd the keys themselves,\nthey get stored right in my directory.\n\n2038\n01:53:06.290 --> 01:53:10.990\nThey get tucked away under, you'll\nsee that folder that it made, gnupg.\n\n2039\n01:53:10.990 --> 01:53:16.390\nSo if I go into ~/.gnupg,\n\n2040\n01:53:16.390 --> 01:53:20.540\nin here is where I'll see\nmy private keys folder.\n\n2041\n01:53:20.540 --> 01:53:23.130\nSee that private-keys-v1.d folder and\n\n2042\n01:53:23.130 --> 01:53:26.170\nthen we'll see some of the other\ninformation that's in here.\n\n2043\n01:53:27.310 --> 01:53:29.470\nSo it's all tucked away.\n\n2044\n01:53:29.470 --> 01:53:32.650\nRight here in my system and\nactually it's even hidden in there.\n\n2045\n01:53:32.650 --> 01:53:34.300\nSo, all right.\n\n2046\n01:53:34.300 --> 01:53:37.630\nSo, now, if I want somebody to\nbe able to encrypt something and\n\n2047\n01:53:37.630 --> 01:53:42.910\nsend it to me,\nI need to give them my public key.\n\n2048\n01:53:42.910 --> 01:53:45.870\nSo, we typically use\nthe export command to do that.\n\n2049\n01:53:45.870 --> 01:53:52.330\nSo, I'm gonna say gpg --export --outputs.\n\n2050\n01:53:52.330 --> 01:53:54.520\nAnd then I specify where\nI wanna out this output.\n\n2051\n01:53:54.520 --> 01:53:57.170\nThere's just say ./.\n\n2052\n01:53:57.170 --> 01:53:58.880\nAnd then we need to give it a file name.\n\n2053\n01:53:58.880 --> 01:54:02.661\nSo I call the dpezet.pub.\n\n2054\n01:54:02.661 --> 01:54:03.743\nOkay.\n\n2055\n01:54:03.743 --> 01:54:07.390\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I just space.\n\n2056\n01:54:07.390 --> 01:54:07.990\nShoot.\n\n2057\n01:54:07.990 --> 01:54:09.160\nNo don't overwrite it.\n\n2058\n01:54:09.160 --> 01:54:11.950\nJust cancel that and\nget rid of that space.\n\n2059\n01:54:13.250 --> 01:54:16.370\nThere, all right, sorry,\nI had an extra space in there.\n\n2060\n01:54:16.370 --> 01:54:19.560\nSo now when I look, I've got\na dpezet.pub file right there, and\n\n2061\n01:54:19.560 --> 01:54:24.380\nif I just take a look at what's in there,\nit's garbled mess.\n\n2062\n01:54:24.380 --> 01:54:27.750\nWell, that's my public key,\nso there's my public key.\n\n2063\n01:54:27.750 --> 01:54:30.365\nIf I send it,\nnow it's mucked up my screen.\n\n2064\n01:54:30.365 --> 01:54:33.930\n[LAUGH] That's funny.\n\n2065\n01:54:33.930 --> 01:54:37.700\nSo, some of the controlled characters have\ngotten in the way nad messed up my screen.\n\n2066\n01:54:37.700 --> 01:54:41.110\nLet's just log out and\nget back in to fix that.\n\n2067\n01:54:41.110 --> 01:54:46.090\nSo, anyhow if I give that public key\nfile to somebody this dpezet.pub.\n\n2068\n01:54:46.090 --> 01:54:50.560\nIf I give that to somebody they can\nuse it to encrypt data on their end,\n\n2069\n01:54:50.560 --> 01:54:53.480\nand then send me the encrypted data.\n\n2070\n01:54:53.480 --> 01:54:58.190\nAnd I can use my private key to\ndecrypt it and look at the data.\n\n2071\n01:54:58.190 --> 01:55:00.290\nI've go the private key,\nit does decryption.\n\n2072\n01:55:00.290 --> 01:55:02.500\nI don't give that to anybody else.\n\n2073\n01:55:02.500 --> 01:55:05.320\nThis public key,\nthat's what I give to people.\n\n2074\n01:55:05.320 --> 01:55:06.370\nI want them to have that.\n\n2075\n01:55:06.370 --> 01:55:07.320\nAnd you can give it to anybody,\n\n2076\n01:55:07.320 --> 01:55:11.340\nyou can post it on the web,\nyou can put it on your Facebook page.\n\n2077\n01:55:11.340 --> 01:55:12.680\nHey, here's my public key,\n\n2078\n01:55:12.680 --> 01:55:15.560\nlet anybody download it because\nwhat happens if they get it?\n\n2079\n01:55:15.560 --> 01:55:18.800\nThat means that they can encrypt\nsomething and send it to you, right?\n\n2080\n01:55:18.800 --> 01:55:21.260\nSo they really can't do\nanything bad with it.\n\n2081\n01:55:21.260 --> 01:55:25.680\nNow distributing it manually is one\nway you can also set up key servers.\n\n2082\n01:55:25.680 --> 01:55:28.140\nAnd there's plenty of companies out\nthere on the internet that do it\n\n2083\n01:55:28.140 --> 01:55:31.160\nwhere you can go and\npost this publicly and have it available.\n\n2084\n01:55:31.160 --> 01:55:31.690\nAll right?\n\n2085\n01:55:31.690 --> 01:55:35.850\nSo now why companies like google and stuff\ndon't make this easy is beyond me but\n\n2086\n01:55:35.850 --> 01:55:38.520\nwe just need some way to distribute\nthis key out to our end users.\n\n2087\n01:55:39.650 --> 01:55:44.350\nIf you're building up a system you can\nactually put this in somebody's profile or\n\n2088\n01:55:44.350 --> 01:55:48.620\nin your skeleton directory so that some\nof the are already there and waiting for\n\n2089\n01:55:48.620 --> 01:55:52.590\nthem so that that is always\na possibility too, right.\n\n2090\n01:55:52.590 --> 01:55:55.390\nSo we're gonna take this key and\nwe're gonna send it to somebody.\n\n2091\n01:55:55.390 --> 01:56:00.210\nWe're gonna give them that key so\nthey can then work with it, maybe\n\n2092\n01:56:00.210 --> 01:56:05.630\nBob Smith wants to send something to me so\nI'm gonna do a little sudo action and\n\n2093\n01:56:05.630 --> 01:56:10.828\ncp that key to /home/bsmith.\n\n2094\n01:56:10.828 --> 01:56:14.930\nOops, that's not gonna do.\n\n2095\n01:56:14.930 --> 01:56:16.340\nPunch in my password.\n\n2096\n01:56:16.340 --> 01:56:18.990\nAnd then I'm just gonna do a quick\nchange of ownership of that file.\n\n2097\n01:56:20.590 --> 01:56:23.419\nSo that bsmith owns it so\nthat he'll be able to work with it.\n\n2098\n01:56:32.149 --> 01:56:35.600\nIf I would sudo it, there we go.\n\n2099\n01:56:35.600 --> 01:56:39.560\nSo, now what I did is I copied that key\nover to Bob Smith's home directory and\n\n2100\n01:56:39.560 --> 01:56:42.310\nwhen I copied it over there I made\nsure to change the ownership of it\n\n2101\n01:56:42.310 --> 01:56:46.350\nbecause otherwise if I copy it as root,\nwho's going to be the owner?\n\n2102\n01:56:46.350 --> 01:56:47.870\nRoot.\nAnd I want Bob to have control of it.\n\n2103\n01:56:47.870 --> 01:56:49.880\nSo I copy it over, and I gave him access.\n\n2104\n01:56:49.880 --> 01:56:52.190\nSo Bob now has my public key.\n\n2105\n01:56:52.190 --> 01:56:56.930\nAnd if I log in as Bob, so\n\n2106\n01:56:56.930 --> 01:57:00.450\nI'm just gonna log in here as bsmith,\nall right?\n\n2107\n01:57:00.450 --> 01:57:02.700\nSo here he is and\nif I look in his directory,\n\n2108\n01:57:02.700 --> 01:57:05.550\nsee how he's got a copy of dpezet.pub now.\n\n2109\n01:57:05.550 --> 01:57:07.780\nSo now he's got a copy\nof my public key and\n\n2110\n01:57:07.780 --> 01:57:13.020\nhe an use that to encrypt some data and\nthen he can send it over to me, all right?\n\n2111\n01:57:13.020 --> 01:57:15.340\nWell why don't we do this,\nwhy don't we stop and take a break here.\n\n2112\n01:57:15.340 --> 01:57:19.220\nAnd when we get back I'll encrypt\nsome data and send it over, and\n\n2113\n01:57:19.220 --> 01:57:21.820\nwe'll decrypt it and kind of get\na chance to see what that looks like.\n\n2114\n01:57:21.820 --> 01:57:25.490\nSo kind of cool stuff there, but\nI've already run over on time so\n\n2115\n01:57:25.490 --> 01:57:29.690\nwe'll stop here and\nbe back in just a moment.\n\n2116\n01:57:32.208 --> 01:57:37.459\n[SOUND] All right, welcome back everybody.\n\n2117\n01:57:37.459 --> 01:57:42.401\nSo during the break I went ahead and\ncreated a PGP key, or GPG key for\n\n2118\n01:57:42.401 --> 01:57:43.290\nBob Smith.\n\n2119\n01:57:43.290 --> 01:57:46.500\nI didn't need to,\ncuz if you're just encrypting one way,\n\n2120\n01:57:46.500 --> 01:57:47.870\nonly one person really needs the key.\n\n2121\n01:57:47.870 --> 01:57:51.268\nBut I went ahead and did it for the other\nuser just to be on the safe side.\n\n2122\n01:57:51.268 --> 01:57:55.440\nOn Bob's side, we gave him the key,\nand if I look inside of his profile,\n\n2123\n01:57:55.440 --> 01:57:59.420\nI'll see he's got dpezet.pub,\nI didn't import it though,\n\n2124\n01:57:59.420 --> 01:58:03.210\nI do need to import that key so\nhe's got it in his GPG keyring.\n\n2125\n01:58:03.210 --> 01:58:06.485\nThe keyring is where you keep all of your,\nwell, your keys, right?\n\n2126\n01:58:06.485 --> 01:58:08.280\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So I need to import it And so\n\n2127\n01:58:08.280 --> 01:58:11.637\nI'm just gonna run gpg --import.\n\n2128\n01:58:11.637 --> 01:58:17.740\nAnd then it is ./dpezet.pub.\n\n2129\n01:58:17.740 --> 01:58:19.320\nSo there it goes, it shows me the key.\n\n2130\n01:58:19.320 --> 01:58:21.930\nI now have a key for Don Pezet.\n\n2131\n01:58:21.930 --> 01:58:25.120\nAnd so it's imported and\nI've got that right there.\n\n2132\n01:58:25.120 --> 01:58:26.980\nSo, I am in business.\n\n2133\n01:58:26.980 --> 01:58:27.980\nAll right.\n\n2134\n01:58:27.980 --> 01:58:31.040\nNext, now that I've got the key for Don,\n\n2135\n01:58:31.040 --> 01:58:33.340\nI can encrypt something\nto send over to them.\n\n2136\n01:58:33.340 --> 01:58:36.510\nAnd we encrypt using the gpg command.\n\n2137\n01:58:36.510 --> 01:58:38.320\nYou've got gpg.\n\n2138\n01:58:38.320 --> 01:58:43.325\nWell, first off, we can do gpg --listkey\nto verify that the key is actually there.\n\n2139\n01:58:43.325 --> 01:58:44.860\nWell, I say that, and\nthen it doesn't work.\n\n2140\n01:58:44.860 --> 01:58:46.560\nList-key.\n\n2141\n01:58:46.560 --> 01:58:47.330\nThere we go.\n\n2142\n01:58:47.330 --> 01:58:50.290\nGpg -- list-key.\n\n2143\n01:58:50.290 --> 01:58:51.870\nAnd it'll show the keys that we've got.\n\n2144\n01:58:51.870 --> 01:58:54.470\nSo I can see that Don Pezet right there.\n\n2145\n01:58:54.470 --> 01:58:55.910\nSo I've got the key.\n\n2146\n01:58:55.910 --> 01:58:59.890\nAnd now what I need to do is\nencrypt a file to send over to Don.\n\n2147\n01:58:59.890 --> 01:59:03.980\nAnd if I look, I've got this file1.txt and\n\n2148\n01:59:03.980 --> 01:59:08.470\nit is just a simple file with one\nline of text in it so there it is.\n\n2149\n01:59:08.470 --> 01:59:12.990\nI wanna send this file to Don but I don't\ntrust the servers that I'm going through\n\n2150\n01:59:12.990 --> 01:59:17.950\nor email or whatever so I wanna encrypt\nit before we send it along, all right?\n\n2151\n01:59:17.950 --> 01:59:19.730\nAnd GPG can encrypt any file.\n\n2152\n01:59:19.730 --> 01:59:22.195\nSo anything you can stick in\na file you can encrypt with it and\n\n2153\n01:59:22.195 --> 01:59:24.677\nthen at the other end they'll\nbe able to decrypt it, okay?\n\n2154\n01:59:24.677 --> 01:59:32.520\nSo I'm gonna encrypt it by\nusing the GPG--encrypt command.\n\n2155\n01:59:32.520 --> 01:59:34.140\nNow when you encrypt it,\n\n2156\n01:59:34.140 --> 01:59:37.680\nyou need to specify who it is\nthat you're encrypting it for.\n\n2157\n01:59:37.680 --> 01:59:41.130\nYou've got more than one key\nin your keychain, right?\n\n2158\n01:59:41.130 --> 01:59:44.440\nAnd so you need to specify the user\nthat you're going to be sending it to.\n\n2159\n01:59:44.440 --> 01:59:48.278\nAnd so in my case, it's don@itpro.tv.\n\n2160\n01:59:48.278 --> 01:59:52.254\nAnd then we need to specify the file\nthat we're going to be encrypting,\n\n2161\n01:59:52.254 --> 01:59:53.658\nin my case it's file1.\n\n2162\n01:59:53.658 --> 01:59:55.005\n.txt.\n\n2163\n01:59:55.005 --> 01:59:55.760\nAll right.\n\n2164\n01:59:55.760 --> 01:59:58.790\nSo when I run that,\nlet me just run over that again.\n\n2165\n01:59:58.790 --> 02:00:02.715\nSo that was gpg--encrypt, that's how\nit knows we're encrypting something,\n\n2166\n02:00:02.715 --> 02:00:05.420\n-r, that's that remote user,\n\n2167\n02:00:05.420 --> 02:00:08.650\nthe person who's private key, or private\nkey that'd be able to decrypt this.\n\n2168\n02:00:08.650 --> 02:00:13.320\ndon@itpro.tv, so the email address\nthat's the identifier I used.\n\n2169\n02:00:13.320 --> 02:00:15.650\nAnd then file1.txt that's the file.\n\n2170\n02:00:15.650 --> 02:00:17.820\nIt looks in the key chain and\nhere it goes.\n\n2171\n02:00:17.820 --> 02:00:19.260\nIt shows this is the key that we have.\n\n2172\n02:00:19.260 --> 02:00:22.100\nNow it says, there's no way to\nassure this is the right key.\n\n2173\n02:00:22.100 --> 02:00:23.850\nIt's up to you to make sure\nyou got the right key.\n\n2174\n02:00:23.850 --> 02:00:27.070\nWell I got this from Don himself,\nso I know it's the right one.\n\n2175\n02:00:27.070 --> 02:00:28.330\nAnd then it's going to encrypt it.\n\n2176\n02:00:28.330 --> 02:00:30.540\nSo I'll go ahead and say yes, use it.\n\n2177\n02:00:32.020 --> 02:00:32.800\nAll right.\n\n2178\n02:00:32.800 --> 02:00:34.040\nAnd so it's going to encrypt it.\n\n2179\n02:00:34.040 --> 02:00:35.595\nIt's not very dramatic is it.\n\n2180\n02:00:35.595 --> 02:00:36.480\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n2181\n02:00:36.480 --> 02:00:41.940\nwhen it's done I now have file1.txt.gpg.\n\n2182\n02:00:41.940 --> 02:00:48.020\nAll right, if I do,\nmore file1.txt, there's my text.\n\n2183\n02:00:48.020 --> 02:00:53.250\nIf I do, more file1.text.gpg,\n\n2184\n02:00:53.250 --> 02:00:56.570\nthere's encrypted junk that\nmessed up my prompt again.\n\n2185\n02:00:56.570 --> 02:00:59.910\nSo there we go, I can see it,\nit's encrypted.\n\n2186\n02:01:01.190 --> 02:01:05.130\nNow I can send that to Don,\nI encrypted it with Don's public key.\n\n2187\n02:01:05.130 --> 02:01:07.160\nThat's all I have,\nI don't have his private key.\n\n2188\n02:01:07.160 --> 02:01:10.090\nSo, if somebody breaks into my\ncomputer and get Don's public key.\n\n2189\n02:01:10.090 --> 02:01:11.360\nDoesn't do any good.\n\n2190\n02:01:11.360 --> 02:01:15.300\nThey won't be able to decrypt this file\nwithout the private key, all right.\n\n2191\n02:01:15.300 --> 02:01:18.250\nI can't decrypt it either,\nI don't have the private key.\n\n2192\n02:01:18.250 --> 02:01:20.110\nSo, now I send it to Don.\n\n2193\n02:01:20.110 --> 02:01:22.310\nAnd for\nthat we'll just cheat a little bit.\n\n2194\n02:01:24.340 --> 02:01:26.270\nSo I'm gonna do a little sudo.\n\n2195\n02:01:26.270 --> 02:01:26.880\nWell first off,\n\n2196\n02:01:26.880 --> 02:01:31.020\nI'm in my home directory and\nI can see I don't have a file1.txt, right?\n\n2197\n02:01:31.020 --> 02:01:36.157\nSo I'm gonna pull that file from\nold bsmith's home directory.\n\n2198\n02:01:45.005 --> 02:01:46.887\n/home/bsmith.\n\n2199\n02:01:50.684 --> 02:01:53.200\n[LAUGH] I thought that was the file name.\n\n2200\n02:01:53.200 --> 02:01:57.280\nIt was file1., and\nnow I'm going to forget.\n\n2201\n02:01:57.280 --> 02:01:58.560\nThere we go.\n\n2202\n02:01:58.560 --> 02:02:00.460\nAll right.\nWell let me just type it all the way out.\n\n2203\n02:02:00.460 --> 02:02:06.662\nSo I'm going to copy\n/home/bsmith/file1.txt.gpg\n\n2204\n02:02:06.662 --> 02:02:11.220\nto my home directory /home/dpezet,\n\n2205\n02:02:11.220 --> 02:02:16.380\nthere we go and the owner because\nI use sudo to do it is root so\n\n2206\n02:02:16.380 --> 02:02:18.240\nI'm just gonna change that real quick.\n\n2207\n02:02:18.240 --> 02:02:22.160\nNormally we would send\nthe encrypted file by email or\n\n2208\n02:02:22.160 --> 02:02:24.220\nstick it on a USB key and\ngive it to somebody, whatever.\n\n2209\n02:02:24.220 --> 02:02:26.170\nIt's encrypted so\nwe can send it however we want.\n\n2210\n02:02:26.170 --> 02:02:27.860\nEmail's perfectly fine, right?\n\n2211\n02:02:27.860 --> 02:02:31.090\nSo I wouldn't normally have to do this\nchange of ownership and all that stuff.\n\n2212\n02:02:31.090 --> 02:02:31.951\nSo but I'm going to.\n\n2213\n02:02:39.083 --> 02:02:40.441\nThere, all right.\n\n2214\n02:02:40.441 --> 02:02:43.207\nSo now that I'm back to\njust regular old Don, and\n\n2215\n02:02:43.207 --> 02:02:46.070\nI've got file1.txt.jpg right there.\n\n2216\n02:02:46.070 --> 02:02:52.040\nNow it's encrypted using my private key,\nI mean using my public key.\n\n2217\n02:02:52.040 --> 02:02:53.410\nI've already got the private key so\n\n2218\n02:02:53.410 --> 02:02:55.140\nI don't need to do any\nkey exchange stuff now.\n\n2219\n02:02:55.140 --> 02:02:57.610\nI can just decrypt this now and\nget access to the file.\n\n2220\n02:02:57.610 --> 02:03:01.720\nSo to decrypt it it's really just gpg and\nthen the file name.\n\n2221\n02:03:03.120 --> 02:03:06.460\nWhen you run it this way it's\nsaying use your private key.\n\n2222\n02:03:06.460 --> 02:03:07.990\nYou only got one private key.\n\n2223\n02:03:07.990 --> 02:03:11.460\nAnd you should be able to decrypt it\nbecause you generated the public key that\n\n2224\n02:03:11.460 --> 02:03:12.610\nencrypted this.\n\n2225\n02:03:12.610 --> 02:03:16.430\nAnd so when I run it, well,\nI assigned a passphrase to my key.\n\n2226\n02:03:16.430 --> 02:03:18.590\nSo I do have to give it my passphrase.\n\n2227\n02:03:18.590 --> 02:03:21.470\nSo I'll punch that in,\nif I can remember it.\n\n2228\n02:03:21.470 --> 02:03:22.410\nThere we go.\n\n2229\n02:03:22.410 --> 02:03:23.960\nAnd there it's gonna run.\n\n2230\n02:03:23.960 --> 02:03:26.110\nAnd it should have decrypted the file.\n\n2231\n02:03:26.110 --> 02:03:29.560\nI'll know if I look in my directory\nI now have a file one.txt.\n\n2232\n02:03:29.560 --> 02:03:36.012\nAnd if I do more file one.txt, it's\nbeen decrypted, there it is, it's mine.\n\n2233\n02:03:36.012 --> 02:03:39.718\nAll right, so not the easiest thing\nin the world to generate the key and\n\n2234\n02:03:39.718 --> 02:03:42.780\nthen you gotta send it to somebody and\nthey have to import the key, and so\n\n2235\n02:03:42.780 --> 02:03:43.780\nit's a little bit of a headache.\n\n2236\n02:03:43.780 --> 02:03:48.640\nWell, from the command line yes, in\nthe GUI we have a nice little wizard, and\n\n2237\n02:03:48.640 --> 02:03:51.800\nit's a lot simpler, and than you\njust email people your public keys,\n\n2238\n02:03:51.800 --> 02:03:53.790\ncause you don't care if\nyour public key gets out.\n\n2239\n02:03:53.790 --> 02:03:56.570\nAnd then they can import it, and\nnow they can encrypt things and\n\n2240\n02:03:56.570 --> 02:03:58.120\nsend them to you, and vice versa.\n\n2241\n02:03:58.120 --> 02:04:00.830\nAnd it's end, to end, encryption.\n\n2242\n02:04:00.830 --> 02:04:05.540\nSo if it goes over SSL, and the SSL\ncertificate's been compromised, and\n\n2243\n02:04:05.540 --> 02:04:08.750\nif it gets stored on a mail server, and\nthe mail server's been compromised, and\n\n2244\n02:04:08.750 --> 02:04:12.150\npeople get access to all of your stuff,\nwell, those files are encrypted.\n\n2245\n02:04:12.150 --> 02:04:13.260\nAnd it's end to end.\n\n2246\n02:04:13.260 --> 02:04:16.290\nSo, unless they get the private\nkey off of your computer,\n\n2247\n02:04:16.290 --> 02:04:17.560\nthey're not gonna be able to see it.\n\n2248\n02:04:17.560 --> 02:04:21.810\nRight, and that's a key function of\nservices like LastPass and stuff,\n\n2249\n02:04:21.810 --> 02:04:24.690\nwhere you don't have to\ntrust their security,\n\n2250\n02:04:24.690 --> 02:04:26.980\ncuz it's your security\nthat's doing the work.\n\n2251\n02:04:26.980 --> 02:04:28.985\nThat's the glory of GPG,\nit's really cool stuff.\n\n2252\n02:04:28.985 --> 02:04:32.280\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n2253\n02:04:32.280 --> 02:04:34.580\n>> All right, so\nthat pretty much wraps up GPG.\n\n2254\n02:04:34.580 --> 02:04:35.920\nI know we talked about SSH.\n\n2255\n02:04:37.360 --> 02:04:41.989\nAt this point we've actually covered\nall of the objectives listed for\n\n2256\n02:04:41.989 --> 02:04:45.560\nthe Linux+ exam and the certification.\n\n2257\n02:04:45.560 --> 02:04:49.190\nThe two Linux+ exams and\nthe certification.\n\n2258\n02:04:49.190 --> 02:04:52.170\nBut I do want to go just\na little bit further.\n\n2259\n02:04:52.170 --> 02:04:56.260\nIn one of the earlier episodes I was\nperforming a command, and it failed.\n\n2260\n02:04:56.260 --> 02:05:01.070\nAnd I remembered that I was running\na Red Hat based operating system.\n\n2261\n02:05:01.070 --> 02:05:06.235\nAnd it had a security sub-layer enabled\nin it called SELinux, all right?\n\n2262\n02:05:06.235 --> 02:05:09.740\nSELinux is a special\nsecurity enhancement for\n\n2263\n02:05:09.740 --> 02:05:14.300\nLinux that provides some really\nneat power and what I had done in\n\n2264\n02:05:14.300 --> 02:05:19.320\nthat episode is I had added a new hard\ndrive and I had mounted it to a folder.\n\n2265\n02:05:19.320 --> 02:05:22.820\nAnd I was trying to perform an operation\nagainst that folder and it failed.\n\n2266\n02:05:22.820 --> 02:05:25.630\nAnd I was running as route,\nit told me permission denied and\n\n2267\n02:05:25.630 --> 02:05:27.090\nI was running as route.\n\n2268\n02:05:27.090 --> 02:05:32.030\nAnd the reason is, SELinux adds a whole\nnew layer of security on top of it.\n\n2269\n02:05:32.030 --> 02:05:34.930\nIt creates what are called\nApplication Policies.\n\n2270\n02:05:34.930 --> 02:05:39.230\nAnd it says this application,\nit might be running as root, sure.\n\n2271\n02:05:39.230 --> 02:05:43.910\nBut, the policy states it can write\nto this folder and that folder and\n\n2272\n02:05:43.910 --> 02:05:46.080\nthat folder and that's it, right.\n\n2273\n02:05:46.080 --> 02:05:49.350\nSo if you take something like SSHD.\n\n2274\n02:05:49.350 --> 02:05:53.240\nSSHD stores its configuration\nfiles in /etc/ssh.\n\n2275\n02:05:53.240 --> 02:05:55.760\nThat's where it stores them, right.\n\n2276\n02:05:55.760 --> 02:06:01.000\nSo when we run the SSHD demon,\nit's gotta be able to look to that folder.\n\n2277\n02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:03.980\nDoes it need to look at the rest of /etc?\n\n2278\n02:06:03.980 --> 02:06:04.650\nNot really.\n\n2279\n02:06:04.650 --> 02:06:06.172\nAll its stuff is right\nthere in one folder.\n\n2280\n02:06:06.172 --> 02:06:13.470\nSo SELinux is configured with a policy\nthat says the SS to HD demon can\n\n2281\n02:06:13.470 --> 02:06:17.860\nlook into /ect/ssh and it can write files\nand it can do whatever it wants in there.\n\n2282\n02:06:17.860 --> 02:06:20.370\nBut it can't do that to the rest of /etc.\n\n2283\n02:06:20.370 --> 02:06:24.590\nThat way if somebody hacks into my system,\nand they get root access and\n\n2284\n02:06:24.590 --> 02:06:29.650\nthey do it by compromising SSHD,\nthey're still partitioned off\n\n2285\n02:06:29.650 --> 02:06:33.760\ninto just the areas that\nSSHD is allowed to operate.\n\n2286\n02:06:33.760 --> 02:06:38.360\nThat is a great thing, that really\ndoes restrain direct software down.\n\n2287\n02:06:38.360 --> 02:06:41.445\nAnd that's what happened to me is\nI added a new hard drive well,\n\n2288\n02:06:41.445 --> 02:06:43.420\nSELinux didn't know about it yet.\n\n2289\n02:06:43.420 --> 02:06:48.500\nIt didn't know, so it blocked me from\nhaving access even though I was root.\n\n2290\n02:06:49.632 --> 02:06:53.450\nNow, SELinux is actually a very\ncomplex thing to set up.\n\n2291\n02:06:53.450 --> 02:06:56.830\nWriting the software policies for\nit is a challenging thing.\n\n2292\n02:06:56.830 --> 02:06:59.750\nAnd there are great websites out\nthere that do a much better job\n\n2293\n02:06:59.750 --> 02:07:02.920\nof explaining it than I'm gonna do\nhere in the few minutes that I have.\n\n2294\n02:07:02.920 --> 02:07:08.730\nSo in the show notes I'm gonna put a link\nto a article that the CentOS guys put out\n\n2295\n02:07:08.730 --> 02:07:14.380\nthat has a great primer on how to create\nyour own SELinux policies, all right?\n\n2296\n02:07:14.380 --> 02:07:17.650\nBut what I wanted to take a minute\nto talk about was disabling SELinux.\n\n2297\n02:07:17.650 --> 02:07:18.970\nAll right.\n\n2298\n02:07:18.970 --> 02:07:21.720\nFirst off, let me just say, don't do it.\n\n2299\n02:07:21.720 --> 02:07:22.930\nDon't disable SELinux.\n\n2300\n02:07:22.930 --> 02:07:26.250\nI see so many posts out there on\nthe Internet where people say,\n\n2301\n02:07:26.250 --> 02:07:27.710\nis SELinux getting in your way?\n\n2302\n02:07:27.710 --> 02:07:28.580\nHere's how you turn it off.\n\n2303\n02:07:28.580 --> 02:07:30.200\nJust turn it off, right?\n\n2304\n02:07:30.200 --> 02:07:33.920\nAnd that's what happens with new\nsecurity stuff, people just turn it off.\n\n2305\n02:07:33.920 --> 02:07:35.950\nBut it's such a great solution.\n\n2306\n02:07:35.950 --> 02:07:39.040\nIt does enhance the security\nof your server and\n\n2307\n02:07:39.040 --> 02:07:42.270\nit minimize the impact of\na compromise if one does happen.\n\n2308\n02:07:42.270 --> 02:07:44.790\nYou want that, you want SELinux.\n\n2309\n02:07:44.790 --> 02:07:48.340\nAll right, so if you're thinking\nabout disabling it, don't.\n\n2310\n02:07:48.340 --> 02:07:51.910\nInstead, you can change\nits behavior a little bit.\n\n2311\n02:07:51.910 --> 02:07:56.213\nThe default behavior for\nSELinux is what's called enforcing.\n\n2312\n02:07:56.213 --> 02:07:58.890\nEnforcing means you have\nto follow the policies.\n\n2313\n02:07:58.890 --> 02:08:01.583\nIt will actively prevent you if you don't.\n\n2314\n02:08:01.583 --> 02:08:05.835\nOkay, if you don't know if you're running\nSELinux or if you don't know if you have\n\n2315\n02:08:05.835 --> 02:08:09.130\nthat, the policy set, or whatever,\nit's real easy to check.\n\n2316\n02:08:09.130 --> 02:08:10.240\nYou just run a simple command.\n\n2317\n02:08:10.240 --> 02:08:11.148\nLet me run it here on mine.\n\n2318\n02:08:11.148 --> 02:08:14.530\nIt is sestatus.\n\n2319\n02:08:14.530 --> 02:08:17.860\nIf you run sestatus,\nit will tell you if you have SELinux,\n\n2320\n02:08:17.860 --> 02:08:18.900\nyou might not have it at all.\n\n2321\n02:08:18.900 --> 02:08:22.420\nUbuntu, Debian, those guys,\nthey don't ship with seLinux.\n\n2322\n02:08:22.420 --> 02:08:25.130\nYou can install it on there,\nbut they don't ship with it.\n\n2323\n02:08:25.130 --> 02:08:27.540\nRed Hat, CentOS, they do.\n\n2324\n02:08:27.540 --> 02:08:33.790\nSo I can see that not only do I have\nSELinux, but it is enabled, and enforcing.\n\n2325\n02:08:33.790 --> 02:08:36.460\nIf some software on my\nsystem tries to behave\n\n2326\n02:08:36.460 --> 02:08:40.000\noutside of the boundaries defined in my\ncurrent policies it's gonna block it.\n\n2327\n02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:41.440\nAnd that's what happened\nin that earlier episode.\n\n2328\n02:08:42.660 --> 02:08:45.220\nWhat your supposed to do when that happens\n\n2329\n02:08:45.220 --> 02:08:49.380\nis change SELinux into what's\ncalled Permissive mode.\n\n2330\n02:08:49.380 --> 02:08:52.430\nIn permissive mode it will\nlet the software run and\n\n2331\n02:08:52.430 --> 02:08:56.810\nit will log to your security log\nall the violations that occurred.\n\n2332\n02:08:56.810 --> 02:09:02.030\nYou can use those violations to then\ncreate an updated policy that reflects\n\n2333\n02:09:02.030 --> 02:09:07.440\nwhat you were trying to do and then you\ncan turn SELinux back to enforcing again.\n\n2334\n02:09:07.440 --> 02:09:09.540\nRight, cuz now you've\napproved that access.\n\n2335\n02:09:09.540 --> 02:09:13.480\nSo, you manually approve that behavior for\nthe software.\n\n2336\n02:09:13.480 --> 02:09:17.420\nIf a hacker tries to get in, you're not\ngonna approve that and it blocks them.\n\n2337\n02:09:17.420 --> 02:09:19.320\nIt is a great software.\n\n2338\n02:09:19.320 --> 02:09:22.445\nToo many people disabled it out of\nhand and you really shouldn't do that.\n\n2339\n02:09:22.445 --> 02:09:27.435\nOkay, if I wanna flip from enforcing the\npermissive, it's not a difficult thing.\n\n2340\n02:09:28.565 --> 02:09:33.245\nIf it's a temporary deal, there's a few\ncommands that you can use to do that but\n\n2341\n02:09:33.245 --> 02:09:37.570\nnormally we want it to be like you\nset it,cuz you have to reboot for\n\n2342\n02:09:37.570 --> 02:09:38.430\nit to take effect anyway.\n\n2343\n02:09:38.430 --> 02:09:40.290\nSo you might as well just set it and\nreboot.\n\n2344\n02:09:40.290 --> 02:09:45.460\nSo what I normally do is\nI edit a little file.\n\n2345\n02:09:45.460 --> 02:09:52.162\nSo I'm gonna do a sudo\nvi /etc/selinux/config.\n\n2346\n02:09:53.250 --> 02:09:58.440\nThat file right there is the file that\ncontains the configuration for SELinux.\n\n2347\n02:09:58.440 --> 02:09:59.960\nAnd you can go into it.\n\n2348\n02:09:59.960 --> 02:10:04.050\nSo that was /etc/selinux/config.\n\n2349\n02:10:04.050 --> 02:10:07.440\nAnd in there, you'll see the SELinux mode.\n\n2350\n02:10:07.440 --> 02:10:09.700\nRight now it's enforcing.\n\n2351\n02:10:09.700 --> 02:10:12.730\nAnd we can change it to permissive or\ndisabled.\n\n2352\n02:10:12.730 --> 02:10:15.750\nIf you're gonna disable it,\nthat's where you go, I don't recommend it.\n\n2353\n02:10:15.750 --> 02:10:17.870\nTake advantage of it,\nit's there for you, right?\n\n2354\n02:10:17.870 --> 02:10:21.570\nBut otherwise you can switch it to\npermissive and then you just reboot.\n\n2355\n02:10:21.570 --> 02:10:24.680\nAnd now you run whatever software\nit was you were trying to run and\n\n2356\n02:10:24.680 --> 02:10:26.970\nthe security log will keep\na track of what's happening.\n\n2357\n02:10:26.970 --> 02:10:30.020\nIt lets it run but\nit logs all the violations.\n\n2358\n02:10:30.020 --> 02:10:34.500\nAnd you then take those violations and\nyou create your policies, all right?\n\n2359\n02:10:34.500 --> 02:10:37.810\nFor distributions that ship with SE Linux,\n\n2360\n02:10:37.810 --> 02:10:43.020\nthose policies are already in place but\nit's kind of invisible to us.\n\n2361\n02:10:43.020 --> 02:10:48.655\nWhen I do an ls-la, I see my files and\nthat's really about it.\n\n2362\n02:10:48.655 --> 02:10:56.347\nIf I do a sudo ls- laZ.\n\n2363\n02:10:56.347 --> 02:11:02.630\nCapital Z will tell it to\nshow me the SELinux profiles.\n\n2364\n02:11:02.630 --> 02:11:05.327\nAnd so I can see some of\nthe policies that are attached here.\n\n2365\n02:11:05.327 --> 02:11:09.534\nAnd so for the system users,\nso for this object,\n\n2366\n02:11:09.534 --> 02:11:15.430\nI can see most of my stuff in here\nis in unconfined user object.\n\n2367\n02:11:15.430 --> 02:11:18.570\nI can see where it's a user home policy,\nand so\n\n2368\n02:11:18.570 --> 02:11:21.600\nthere's a policy somewhere\ncalled User Home.\n\n2369\n02:11:21.600 --> 02:11:25.890\nAnd it's defining what software is\nallowed to access and edit these files.\n\n2370\n02:11:25.890 --> 02:11:28.500\nEditing those policies is pretty complex.\n\n2371\n02:11:28.500 --> 02:11:31.670\nSo like I said in my notes,\nwhere are my notes?\n\n2372\n02:11:31.670 --> 02:11:34.280\nHere, at the end of the show notes today,\n\n2373\n02:11:34.280 --> 02:11:39.060\nI'm posting a link,\nwhich is the CentOS page on how to.\n\n2374\n02:11:39.060 --> 02:11:44.380\nRed Hat has one also, and\ntheirs is a little overly complex I think.\n\n2375\n02:11:44.380 --> 02:11:45.840\nI don't like theirs so much.\n\n2376\n02:11:45.840 --> 02:11:50.810\nBut the CentOs1, what it does,\nis it goes through and\n\n2377\n02:11:50.810 --> 02:11:55.210\nit shows you, well first it\nexplains why you want SELinux, and\n\n2378\n02:11:55.210 --> 02:11:58.920\nthen it talks about how to switch you to\npermissive like I was just showing you.\n\n2379\n02:11:58.920 --> 02:12:03.070\nBut then it goes and\nshows you how to create your policies.\n\n2380\n02:12:03.070 --> 02:12:05.630\nHow to define your own policy\nto restrict something.\n\n2381\n02:12:05.630 --> 02:12:07.170\nSo they show like here, HTTPD.\n\n2382\n02:12:07.170 --> 02:12:09.100\nIf you're running a web server,\n\n2383\n02:12:09.100 --> 02:12:12.150\nyour web server needs to have\naccess to certain directories.\n\n2384\n02:12:12.150 --> 02:12:14.770\nWhat if you have a virtual directory\nthat's on a separate hard drive?\n\n2385\n02:12:14.770 --> 02:12:17.360\nYou'll need to add that to the policy.\n\n2386\n02:12:17.360 --> 02:12:19.780\nOr here they're adding individual files or\nwhatever.\n\n2387\n02:12:19.780 --> 02:12:22.330\nSo they show how to do that and\nhow to troubleshoot it.\n\n2388\n02:12:22.330 --> 02:12:23.920\nIt's a great article.\n\n2389\n02:12:23.920 --> 02:12:25.170\nIt's not terribly long.\n\n2390\n02:12:25.170 --> 02:12:27.080\nIt'll take you about half\nan hour to read it and\n\n2391\n02:12:27.080 --> 02:12:29.630\nit will give you a great\nunderstanding of SELinux.\n\n2392\n02:12:29.630 --> 02:12:32.140\nSo, if you really want to improve\nthe security of your system,\n\n2393\n02:12:32.140 --> 02:12:33.600\nyou should look into this.\n\n2394\n02:12:33.600 --> 02:12:38.290\nAnd it's one of the main reasons that\nwhen I run an internet facing server,\n\n2395\n02:12:38.290 --> 02:12:43.500\nI almost always run CentOS because I like\nto have this, or Red Hat Enterprise Linux.\n\n2396\n02:12:43.500 --> 02:12:45.110\nI just wanted to talk about it\nhere at the end of the show.\n\n2397\n02:12:45.110 --> 02:12:47.520\nNot on the exam,\nSELinux is not on the exam.\n\n2398\n02:12:47.520 --> 02:12:49.598\nBut it's good to know.\n\n2399\n02:12:49.598 --> 02:12:53.730\nAll right,\nwell that pretty much wraps us up.\n\n2400\n02:12:53.730 --> 02:12:57.230\nThat is the end of\nthe Linux+ certification.\n\n2401\n02:12:57.230 --> 02:13:00.229\nWe covered both the LX0-101 and\n\n2402\n02:13:00.229 --> 02:13:04.875\nLX0- 102 exam certification topics\nwhatever, the whole shebang.\n\n2403\n02:13:04.875 --> 02:13:07.355\nI know this episode was a little bit of a\nlong one because we needed to get through\n\n2404\n02:13:07.355 --> 02:13:08.145\nthat last bit.\n\n2405\n02:13:08.145 --> 02:13:10.225\nBut, that's basically it.\n\n2406\n02:13:10.225 --> 02:13:13.000\nHopefully you guys enjoyed the show and\nyou learned a lot.\n\n2407\n02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:17.570\nI do wanna remind you if you have\nany questions, you
