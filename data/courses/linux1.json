          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.665\n[MUSIC]\n\n2\n00:00:07.665 --> 00:00:08.925\n>> In this segment,\n\n3\n00:00:08.925 --> 00:00:14.899\nwe're gonna give you a brief overview\nof the Linux+ LXO-103 and 104 exams.\n\n4\n00:00:14.899 --> 00:00:15.407\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yes,\n\n5\n00:00:15.407 --> 00:00:17.804\nthere are two of them\navailable from CompTIA.\n\n6\n00:00:17.804 --> 00:00:19.368\nAnd joining me today is Don.\n\n7\n00:00:19.368 --> 00:00:23.291\nHe's gonna give us a help here and give us\na good overview of what we can expect and\n\n8\n00:00:23.291 --> 00:00:24.711\nsee in the upcoming series.\n\n9\n00:00:24.711 --> 00:00:26.256\nSo Don, take it away.\n\n10\n00:00:26.256 --> 00:00:28.187\nWhat can we expect from this series?\n\n11\n00:00:28.187 --> 00:00:31.568\n>> Well, the CompTIA Linux+ certification\nis a great certification for\n\n12\n00:00:31.568 --> 00:00:33.549\npeople just getting started with Linux.\n\n13\n00:00:33.549 --> 00:00:35.953\nYou don't have to know one\nsingle bit about Linux, and\n\n14\n00:00:35.953 --> 00:00:38.356\nwe start with running through\nhow to get it installed,\n\n15\n00:00:38.356 --> 00:00:40.721\nsome of the different\ndistributions to choose from.\n\n16\n00:00:40.721 --> 00:00:43.221\nAnd then once it's installed,\nhow to support and operate it.\n\n17\n00:00:43.221 --> 00:00:47.043\nThe goal of the CompTIA Linux+\ncertification is to prove that you have\n\n18\n00:00:47.043 --> 00:00:49.701\nthe knowledge to support\nLinux workstations and\n\n19\n00:00:49.701 --> 00:00:51.734\nservers in a business environment.\n\n20\n00:00:51.734 --> 00:00:56.195\nAnd that's a pretty important thing to be\nable to do these days as Linux usage is\n\n21\n00:00:56.195 --> 00:00:57.423\nraising every year.\n\n22\n00:00:57.423 --> 00:00:59.310\nSeeing more and\nmore server deployments and\n\n23\n00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:01.709\neven a few more desktop\ndeployments that are out there.\n\n24\n00:01:01.709 --> 00:01:04.331\nNow, a couple of neat things\nabout the certification.\n\n25\n00:01:04.331 --> 00:01:06.889\nIt is two exams, like Daniel mentioned.\n\n26\n00:01:06.889 --> 00:01:08.963\nSo it divides the topics in\nhalf which is kind of nice.\n\n27\n00:01:08.963 --> 00:01:12.513\nMakes it where you have a smaller set\nof data to deal with for each exam, but\n\n28\n00:01:12.513 --> 00:01:16.237\nthe other thing is CompTIA developed\nthis in partnership with the LPI, and so\n\n29\n00:01:16.237 --> 00:01:18.207\nyou'll see like on their website here.\n\n30\n00:01:18.207 --> 00:01:24.728\nLet me pull up CompTIA's website where\nit's the CompTIA Linux+ powered by LPI.\n\n31\n00:01:24.728 --> 00:01:28.100\nNow LPI, they're an organization\nthat makes Linux certifications.\n\n32\n00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.749\nAnd when you get your CompTIA Linux+,\n\n33\n00:01:30.749 --> 00:01:35.089\nyou actually get your LPIC-1\ncertification at the same time.\n\n34\n00:01:35.089 --> 00:01:39.498\nYou get two certifications at once, and\nso that's a neat little benefit here.\n\n35\n00:01:39.498 --> 00:01:42.689\nIt's the same set of exams, and\nyou kind of get double certifications.\n\n36\n00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:47.638\nNow, the exams themselves are the LX-103\nand 104, and those divide up the content\n\n37\n00:01:47.638 --> 00:01:50.650\nlike I said, and\nthey divide it up in a pretty neat way.\n\n38\n00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:52.703\nLet me bring up the objectives here.\n\n39\n00:01:52.703 --> 00:01:55.710\nSo here's the exam objectives for\nthe LX0-103.\n\n40\n00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.844\nIt's the first part that\nwe cover in the series, and\n\n41\n00:01:58.844 --> 00:02:01.561\nit focuses on introducing\nyou guys to Linux.\n\n42\n00:02:01.561 --> 00:02:04.135\nSo if you've never worked\nwith Linux before,\n\n43\n00:02:04.135 --> 00:02:06.254\nit starts with system architecture.\n\n44\n00:02:06.254 --> 00:02:07.372\nWhat is Linux?\n\n45\n00:02:07.372 --> 00:02:08.205\nHow does it work?\n\n46\n00:02:08.205 --> 00:02:09.485\nWhat's going on under the hood?\n\n47\n00:02:09.485 --> 00:02:10.906\nHow does this thing even function?\n\n48\n00:02:10.906 --> 00:02:13.893\nWhat is it that makes Linux Linux?\n\n49\n00:02:13.893 --> 00:02:17.043\nAnd then it moves on to installation and\npackage management.\n\n50\n00:02:17.043 --> 00:02:21.533\nHow do I install the operating system,\nand how do I add software on top of that?\n\n51\n00:02:21.533 --> 00:02:25.109\nBecause it's not gonna be terribly useful\nunless I have some good software on there.\n\n52\n00:02:25.109 --> 00:02:28.217\nThen we learn about our standard GNU and\nUnix commands.\n\n53\n00:02:28.217 --> 00:02:29.939\nSo as we work with\nthe command line utilities,\n\n54\n00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:32.423\nwe've got a ton of programs we need\nto know, we learn about those.\n\n55\n00:02:32.423 --> 00:02:36.791\nAnd lastly, we talk about our hardware,\nour file systems, devices, the hierarchy,\n\n56\n00:02:36.791 --> 00:02:39.046\nhow it kind of arranges\nthings in the system.\n\n57\n00:02:39.046 --> 00:02:41.223\nSo this is a fairly low level course,\n\n58\n00:02:41.223 --> 00:02:45.440\nreally focusing on the operating\nsystem itself, getting it running on\n\n59\n00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.814\nyour computer and all the different\nways it interacts with the computer.\n\n60\n00:02:49.814 --> 00:02:52.772\nEverything you need to know\nto get started with Linux,\n\n61\n00:02:52.772 --> 00:02:56.903\nthat's the focus of the 103 exam,\nand it's all divided fairly evenly.\n\n62\n00:02:56.903 --> 00:03:00.384\nThe command line is really where\nthe majority of the exam is based, and\n\n63\n00:03:00.384 --> 00:03:01.446\nthat's important,\n\n64\n00:03:01.446 --> 00:03:05.295\ncuz we need that for the second exam where\nwe start to use all these utilities.\n\n65\n00:03:05.295 --> 00:03:10.049\nNow, the second exam is the 104 and\nlet me just pull that up real quick.\n\n66\n00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:13.824\nHere's the 104, and the exam\nobjectives are a little different here.\n\n67\n00:03:13.824 --> 00:03:16.993\nNow, it shifts from how does Linux work?\n\n68\n00:03:16.993 --> 00:03:19.920\nHow do I get Linux running\nto how do I use it?\n\n69\n00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.459\nNow that I got it up and\nrunning, what do I do with it?\n\n70\n00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:24.024\nSo how do we use the shell?\n\n71\n00:03:24.024 --> 00:03:26.359\nHow do we write scripts\nto automate things?\n\n72\n00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:28.006\nHow do we manage our data?\n\n73\n00:03:28.006 --> 00:03:30.810\nWhat kind of user interfaces and\ndesktops are available?\n\n74\n00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.165\nWhat are my end users going to see?\n\n75\n00:03:33.165 --> 00:03:37.665\nWhat are standard administrative tasks I\nneed to do keep Linux running smoothly and\n\n76\n00:03:37.665 --> 00:03:38.509\nefficiently?\n\n77\n00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:41.598\nThat's where we make our money\nby supporting these systems.\n\n78\n00:03:41.598 --> 00:03:44.685\nThen essential system services,\nthis is where it deviates.\n\n79\n00:03:44.685 --> 00:03:46.839\nIt stops talking about Linux and\n\n80\n00:03:46.839 --> 00:03:50.680\nstarts talking about the services\nwe run on top of Linux.\n\n81\n00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.121\nDo you want to run a web server?\n\n82\n00:03:52.121 --> 00:03:52.934\nWe talk about that.\n\n83\n00:03:52.934 --> 00:03:53.971\nWant to run a mail server?\n\n84\n00:03:53.971 --> 00:03:55.007\nA file server?\n\n85\n00:03:55.007 --> 00:03:56.895\nWe hit each of those kind of critical,\n\n86\n00:03:56.895 --> 00:03:59.496\nessential services that\na company is going to need.\n\n87\n00:03:59.496 --> 00:04:00.980\nThen we do networking.\n\n88\n00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:04.292\nIf you're deploying Linux, it is a network\noperating system under the hood.\n\n89\n00:04:04.292 --> 00:04:07.264\nSo we need to understand how to get\nthose systems to talk to each other, so\n\n90\n00:04:07.264 --> 00:04:08.355\nwe spend some time there.\n\n91\n00:04:08.355 --> 00:04:12.927\nAnd then lastly, what's probably\nthe most important section is security.\n\n92\n00:04:12.927 --> 00:04:15.262\nHow do we make sure that our\nLinux installs are safe?\n\n93\n00:04:15.262 --> 00:04:19.774\nThe desktops are always pretty safe, but\nthe servers, those are big attack targets.\n\n94\n00:04:19.774 --> 00:04:22.170\nThere's hackers out there that\nwant to get into your system.\n\n95\n00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:23.897\nSo how do we make sure\nthat doesn't happen?\n\n96\n00:04:23.897 --> 00:04:27.630\nAnd we talk about how to secure the files\nand the networking on our systems and\n\n97\n00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:28.632\nget those secured.\n\n98\n00:04:28.632 --> 00:04:34.330\nSo the second exam, the 104, is much more\nabout using Linux than the 103 exam is,\n\n99\n00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.570\nwhich is more about getting Linux up and\nrunning.\n\n100\n00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:40.545\nBut by dividing it in half like this,\nit makes it easier for\n\n101\n00:04:40.545 --> 00:04:42.568\nyou to focus in on one particular area.\n\n102\n00:04:42.568 --> 00:04:43.990\nTake that exam and pass it and\n\n103\n00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:48.035\nthen change your focus without having to\nbe distracted by too many crazy things.\n\n104\n00:04:48.035 --> 00:04:51.245\nNow if you pass one exam,\nyou do not get a certification.\n\n105\n00:04:51.245 --> 00:04:54.962\nYou have to pass both exams to\nget the Linux+ certification.\n\n106\n00:04:54.962 --> 00:04:58.477\nAnd when you pass them both,\nyou also get the LPIC-1 certification.\n\n107\n00:04:58.477 --> 00:05:01.567\nSo you do have to pass both,\ndon't think you can just do one.\n\n108\n00:05:01.567 --> 00:05:04.564\nThey really are a pair, and\nthat's why here on ITProTV,\n\n109\n00:05:04.564 --> 00:05:08.008\nyou'll notice that our show is both,\nthe 103 and the 104.\n\n110\n00:05:08.008 --> 00:05:09.023\nNow, we cover them in that order.\n\n111\n00:05:09.023 --> 00:05:12.070\nWe do divide it in half, but\nwe know you're gonna watch both.\n\n112\n00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:13.956\nSo we grouped them together,\nyou'll see them,\n\n113\n00:05:13.956 --> 00:05:16.397\nyou kind of move through them all and\nthen go and pass that exam.\n\n114\n00:05:16.397 --> 00:05:16.966\n>> Awesome stuff.\n\n115\n00:05:16.966 --> 00:05:19.614\nNow when you are ready to\ntake the exam should I say,\n\n116\n00:05:19.614 --> 00:05:23.938\nyou covered all the material, you watched\nour videos, you think, you know what?\n\n117\n00:05:23.938 --> 00:05:25.339\nI think I got this guy down.\n\n118\n00:05:25.339 --> 00:05:28.753\nDon, what do we got to do to get signed\nup for that exam so we can take it?\n\n119\n00:05:28.753 --> 00:05:32.653\n>> Well, CompTIA uses Pearson VUE for\ntheir testing exclusively.\n\n120\n00:05:32.653 --> 00:05:35.213\nSo you need to go to a Pearson VUE\ncenter to be able to take that.\n\n121\n00:05:35.213 --> 00:05:37.834\nFortunately, they've got\ncenters all over the world.\n\n122\n00:05:37.834 --> 00:05:43.259\nIf you wanna find one, the website to\ngo to is vue.com, and it's V-U-E.com.\n\n123\n00:05:43.259 --> 00:05:45.392\nAnd so I've got their\nwebsite pulled up right here.\n\n124\n00:05:45.392 --> 00:05:48.460\nSo this is Pearson Vue's website,\nV-U-E.com.\n\n125\n00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:50.857\nIt actually redirects to pearsonvue.com.\n\n126\n00:05:50.857 --> 00:05:55.733\nBut once you're here, you can see this\nlink here that says, For test takers.\n\n127\n00:05:55.733 --> 00:06:00.027\nAnd so you can go to the test taker web\npage, and on the test taker web page,\n\n128\n00:06:00.027 --> 00:06:04.809\nthey've got where you can come in and pick\nthe program that you're looking for and\n\n129\n00:06:04.809 --> 00:06:06.908\nthen find a location to take a test.\n\n130\n00:06:06.908 --> 00:06:10.894\nSo if I come in and say that I'm\nlooking for a CompTIA exam, and\n\n131\n00:06:10.894 --> 00:06:15.428\nit takes me to the official CompTIA\npage and starts to tell me about it.\n\n132\n00:06:15.428 --> 00:06:17.967\nAnd over here,\nit gives me the chance to sign in and\n\n133\n00:06:17.967 --> 00:06:20.873\ncreate a free account to then go and\nsign up for the exams.\n\n134\n00:06:20.873 --> 00:06:22.009\nNow, the exams are not free.\n\n135\n00:06:22.009 --> 00:06:24.697\nWhen you login, it will tell you how\nmuch they cost, cuz it's different for\n\n136\n00:06:24.697 --> 00:06:27.354\ndifferent countries, but the most\nimportant part is this guy right here.\n\n137\n00:06:27.354 --> 00:06:28.978\nFind a test center.\n\n138\n00:06:28.978 --> 00:06:33.591\nYou can choose that and find\na Pearson Vue testing center near you.\n\n139\n00:06:33.591 --> 00:06:36.659\nSo let's think of a city.\n\n140\n00:06:36.659 --> 00:06:37.451\n>> Cincinnati.\n\n141\n00:06:37.451 --> 00:06:38.832\n>> Cincinnati, you had to pick\none I don't know how to spell.\n\n142\n00:06:38.832 --> 00:06:42.164\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Cincinnati, that's what Ohio?\n\n143\n00:06:42.164 --> 00:06:42.835\n>> Yep.\n\n144\n00:06:42.835 --> 00:06:43.851\n>> Cincinnati, Ohio.\n\n145\n00:06:43.851 --> 00:06:46.330\nSo we'll go ahead and search for\nthat, which I'm sure I spelled wrong.\n\n146\n00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:47.671\nThere we go.\n\n147\n00:06:47.671 --> 00:06:50.100\nSo here it pulled up Cincinnati, Ohio, and\n\n148\n00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:54.050\nthere's five Pearson Vue testing\ncenters right there in Cincinnati.\n\n149\n00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:57.053\nAnd you can even pick small towns like\nwe're here in Gainesville, Florida, and\n\n150\n00:06:57.053 --> 00:06:58.743\nGainesville, Florida is a very small town.\n\n151\n00:06:58.743 --> 00:07:01.585\nAnd so if I do a search for\nGainesville, Florida,\n\n152\n00:07:01.585 --> 00:07:05.935\nyou'll see that there's actually more\nthan one testing center here also.\n\n153\n00:07:05.935 --> 00:07:07.419\nAnd so that's convenient.\n\n154\n00:07:07.419 --> 00:07:09.390\nActually, there's four\ntesting centers here.\n\n155\n00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:12.866\nYou'll find that a lot of\ncommunity colleges and\n\n156\n00:07:12.866 --> 00:07:18.898\neven just private training companies will\nhave testing centers available for you.\n\n157\n00:07:18.898 --> 00:07:22.046\nSo there's just a lot of opportunity to\nfind one that's nearby, you can go and\n\n158\n00:07:22.046 --> 00:07:22.677\ntake the test.\n\n159\n00:07:22.677 --> 00:07:25.988\nYou don't sign up for\nthe test at the testing center.\n\n160\n00:07:25.988 --> 00:07:28.142\nDon't go to the testing\ncenter expecting to sign up.\n\n161\n00:07:28.142 --> 00:07:31.260\nMake sure you go to the VUE website and\nsign up there and\n\n162\n00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:34.114\nthen pick your testing center and\ngo and take it.\n\n163\n00:07:34.114 --> 00:07:39.104\nAnd when you pass the exam, the testing\ncenter sends those results up to CompTIA,\n\n164\n00:07:39.104 --> 00:07:44.110\nand then CompTIA gets you a certificate\nthat shows you are now Linux+ certified.\n\n165\n00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:48.234\nNow keep in mind that there are continuing\neducation requirements for Linux+ that you\n\n166\n00:07:48.234 --> 00:07:52.258\nneed to recertify every two years, or you\nneed to do continuing education credits.\n\n167\n00:07:52.258 --> 00:07:54.221\nYou continue to watch shows and\n\n168\n00:07:54.221 --> 00:07:59.064\nattend other courses to get CE credits\nto keep your certification current.\n\n169\n00:07:59.064 --> 00:08:02.031\nYou can't just take it once and forget\nabout it, you do need to maintain it.\n\n170\n00:08:02.031 --> 00:08:02.877\n>> Awesome.\nNow Don,\n\n171\n00:08:02.877 --> 00:08:06.284\nis there anything else that we need to\nknow about the Linux+ certification exams\n\n172\n00:08:06.284 --> 00:08:09.609\nspecifically, or our series coming up\nthat you'd like to tell the audience?\n\n173\n00:08:09.609 --> 00:08:12.567\n>> So the series, we cover all\nthe objectives for the 103 and\n\n174\n00:08:12.567 --> 00:08:14.018\nthe 104 certifications.\n\n175\n00:08:14.018 --> 00:08:15.053\nSo we knock them all out.\n\n176\n00:08:15.053 --> 00:08:17.736\nWe cover everything you need to know\nto get in there and pass that exam.\n\n177\n00:08:17.736 --> 00:08:20.511\nYou may choose to supplement your\nstudies with a book if you want,\n\n178\n00:08:20.511 --> 00:08:22.285\nthere's plenty of great ones out there.\n\n179\n00:08:22.285 --> 00:08:25.970\nSybex has a wonderful Linux+ book you\ncan use, really good content there, but\n\n180\n00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:29.435\nour video is designed to be pretty\nall-inclusive to cover all those topics\n\n181\n00:08:29.435 --> 00:08:31.143\nand to make sure that you're ready.\n\n182\n00:08:31.143 --> 00:08:34.927\nWe do have practice exams\navailable on the website,\n\n183\n00:08:34.927 --> 00:08:38.376\nso we do practice exams\nthrough Transcenders.\n\n184\n00:08:38.376 --> 00:08:39.311\nThere we go, I almost forgot.\n\n185\n00:08:39.311 --> 00:08:42.209\nSo you can get practice exams to make\nsure that you're ready for it, but\n\n186\n00:08:42.209 --> 00:08:43.821\nit's a pretty straightforward exam.\n\n187\n00:08:43.821 --> 00:08:45.284\nThere's no trick questions on this one.\n\n188\n00:08:45.284 --> 00:08:46.808\nYou either know the commands,\nor you don't.\n\n189\n00:08:46.808 --> 00:08:47.680\nYou learn the content.\n\n190\n00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:48.899\nYou get in there and pass it.\n\n191\n00:08:48.899 --> 00:08:49.915\nDefinitely a great one.\n\n192\n00:08:49.915 --> 00:08:54.211\nOnce you're Linux+ certified,\nif you wanna move beyond Linux+,\n\n193\n00:08:54.211 --> 00:08:57.109\nit's a good idea to check\nout the LPI website.\n\n194\n00:08:57.109 --> 00:08:59.525\nThe LPI guys, they have a ton\nof other certifications too.\n\n195\n00:08:59.525 --> 00:09:03.975\nCompTIA just has the Linux+ which again,\nyou really don't have any prerequisites.\n\n196\n00:09:03.975 --> 00:09:06.215\nYou don't need to have any\nprior experience with Linux,\n\n197\n00:09:06.215 --> 00:09:07.942\nyou can just jump right in and\nget started and\n\n198\n00:09:07.942 --> 00:09:10.010\nlearn everything that you\nneed to know to deploy it.\n\n199\n00:09:10.010 --> 00:09:11.310\nIt's really good stuff.\n\n200\n00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:12.082\n>> Excellent, Don.\n\n201\n00:09:12.082 --> 00:09:13.646\nWell, thank you so much for that synopsis.\n\n202\n00:09:13.646 --> 00:09:15.170\nHopefully, that worked out for you.\n\n203\n00:09:15.170 --> 00:09:19.237\nAnd if Linux+ sounds like something\nthat's exciting, and it's entertaining or\n\n204\n00:09:19.237 --> 00:09:21.094\nsomething you need to do, well then,\n\n205\n00:09:21.094 --> 00:09:23.723\nwe look forward to seeing\nyou in our upcoming series.\n\n206\n00:09:23.723 --> 00:09:31.840\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

They begin by explaining the Transmission Control Protocol and how it is used to deliver data over the network. Then they show you how to use some of the built-in systems, like netstat, to see these connections. Finally they talk about the concepts and uses of TCP/UDP ports; giving you a list of common ports that you'll need to know for the exam.",
