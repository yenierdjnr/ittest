All right, so Linux for beginners,\na series we decided to create.\n\n7\n00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:21.970\nIt's really not built around\na structured process,\n\n8\n00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:26.868\nlike normally it's really just designed\nto help people get started with Linux.\n\n9\n00:00:26.868 --> 00:00:31.429\nAnd a lot of people out there have not\nused Linux even one single moment.\n\n10\n00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:32.368\nBut you hear about it.\n\n11\n00:00:32.368 --> 00:00:33.585\nIt sounds really interesting.\n\n12\n00:00:33.585 --> 00:00:36.090\nIt makes you seem really\ncool if you use it, right?\n\n13\n00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.630\nSo people want to get that experience.\n\n14\n00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:41.450\nAnd unfortunately, most of the training\nthat's out there jumps into\n\n15\n00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:43.980\nthe higher level, it expects you to\nhave a lot of previous knowledge.\n\n16\n00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.600\nSo we wanted to create\na series that didn't\n\n17\n00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.270\nrequire a lot of previous knowledge.\n\n18\n00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.640\nIt could let you hop in and start to learn\nabout what the Linux operating system is.\n\n19\n00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:53.420\nWhere it came from.\n\n20\n00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.120\nAnd get a chance to see how you can\nuse it or even if you should use it.\n\n21\n00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.120\nBecause it's not right for everybody and\nyou might need to know it.\n\n22\n00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.840\nCan you determine that?\n\n23\n00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.264\nShould I even bother looking at a Linux?\n\n24\n00:01:03.264 --> 00:01:05.108\nAnd this course is really\ndesigned to help with that.\n\n25\n00:01:05.108 --> 00:01:09.045\nIt's designed to be your first step in\nthe direction of learning to use the Linux\n\n26\n00:01:09.045 --> 00:01:10.939\noperating system as your primary OS.\n\n27\n00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:13.473\n&gt;&gt; Now who would benefit most\nfrom watching this series?\n\n28\n00:01:13.473 --> 00:01:16.796\n&gt;&gt; This series is absolutely geared\ntowards people with zero Linux\n\n29\n00:01:16.796 --> 00:01:18.110\nknowledge, right?\n\n30\n00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.730\nSo if you've never even installed Linux or\nmaybe this overview\n\n31\n00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:25.530\nis the very first time you've heard\nof the Linux operating system.\n\n32\n00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.220\nThen Linux for\nBeginners is gonna be perfect for you.\n\n33\n00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.090\nBecause we're gonna walk you through the\nprocess of understanding how the OS works\n\n34\n00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:33.120\nand how to use it.\n\n35\n00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.400\nAnd it can be intimidating.\n\n36\n00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.430\nYou go online and you see people all these\nshell scripts and doing programming.\n\n37\n00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:41.050\nIt doesn't start there, right?\n\n38\n00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.940\nIt starts with a graphically user\ninterface and being able to click around,\n\n39\n00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.180\nbeing able to run applications, and\ndo the things that you're used to.\n\n40\n00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.110\nMaybe you already use Microsoft Windows or\n\n41\n00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.710\nyou use Apple's Mac OS and\nyou know how those work.\n\n42\n00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.480\nWell, a lot of that knowledge can transfer\nright over into using Linux as well.\n\n43\n00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:01.380\nThere's a lot of similarities between\nthem, so that's where we'd get started.\n\n44\n00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.960\nIf you've already got a reasonable\nexperience with Linux,\n\n45\n00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.540\nif you've been using it even just\nas a hobbyist for a few months,\n\n46\n00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.370\nthen you've probably already got\nthe knowledge of this series.\n\n47\n00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:12.740\nAnd you probably wanna skip past and\ngo to one of our more advanced show.\n\n48\n00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.690\nBut if you've never used Linux,\nthis show is for you.\n\n49\n00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.400\n&gt;&gt; Is there a certification available for\nthis course?\n\n50\n00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.860\n&gt;&gt; No, we chose not to follow\na certification on this one,\n\n51\n00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.090\nbecause a lot of certifications are built\naround more advanced knowledge.\n\n52\n00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.680\nAnd we wanted to tailor\nthis towards the beginner.\n\n53\n00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.895\nSo don't worry about a test.\n\n54\n00:02:28.895 --> 00:02:30.770\nThere's no quiz on Monday, right?\n\n55\n00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:33.760\nIt's just getting you comfortable,\ngetting you where you're ready to learn.\n\n56\n00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.000\nAnd once you get through this and\n\n57\n00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.150\nyou become comfortable with the operating\nsystem and you're able to use it.\n\n58\n00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.440\nThen you can start focusing\non the more advanced topics.\n\n59\n00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.068\nAnd you can look at things like\nCompTIA Linux+ certification or LPIC-1 or\n\n60\n00:02:44.068 --> 00:02:47.307\nany of the other number of Linux\ncertifications that are out there.\n\n61\n00:02:47.307 --> 00:02:50.956\nBut at the beginner stage,\ndon't worry about certifications yet.\n\n62\n00:02:50.956 --> 00:02:53.268\nJust worry about getting\ncomfortable with the OS.\n\n63\n00:02:53.268 --> 00:02:55.782\n&gt;&gt; Now what kind of topics\nare covered in Linux for beginners?\n\n64\n00:02:55.782 --> 00:02:59.683\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\nthis show it's kind of a living project,\n\n65\n00:02:59.683 --> 00:03:02.430\nwe're always adding more stuff to it.\n\n66\n00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.190\nSo as we get feedback from users who say,\n\n67\n00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.460\nboy I'd really like to learn\nhow to do x or y or whatever.\n\n68\n00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:10.160\nWe'll film content and put it in there.\n\n69\n00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.906\nBut at a basics, we're gonna\nstart off with a history lesson.\n\n70\n00:03:12.906 --> 00:03:15.990\nRight, so, where did the Linux\noperating system come from?\n\n71\n00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.830\nWho created it?\n\n72\n00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:18.370\nWhy is it free?\n\n73\n00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:22.560\nThat kind of stuff cuz it seems really\nodd, don't they have to make money?\n\n74\n00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.590\nSo we talk a little about that,\nwhere Linux came from.\n\n75\n00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:29.250\nAnd then, we start to take\na look at how Linux works.\n\n76\n00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.740\nWe take a look at the desktop, and\nthe various desktops, cuz there's many,\n\n77\n00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:36.850\nmany different graphical user interfaces,\nand desktops, and windows managers,\n\n78\n00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:39.710\nand desktop compositors that you can use.\n\n79\n00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:43.040\nNow, some of those words I just used\nyou might not be familiar with,\n\n80\n00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.720\nwe explain that.\n\n81\n00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:48.190\nHow everything fits together to create\nwhat you see on your screen and\n\n82\n00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:49.448\nthe choices that are out there.\n\n83\n00:03:49.448 --> 00:03:52.557\nMan, it just amazing cuz you\nmight hate one window manager.\n\n84\n00:03:52.557 --> 00:03:54.634\nAnd you love another one, so switch.\n\n85\n00:03:54.634 --> 00:03:55.830\nIt's easy.\nIt's easy to do.\n\n86\n00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:58.652\nIt's not like Windows where\nyou have one Window manager or\n\n87\n00:03:58.652 --> 00:04:00.550\nMac OS where you have one Window manager.\n\n88\n00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:02.500\nOn Linux, you have a ton, you can pick.\n\n89\n00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.490\nSo we introduce you to that.\n\n90\n00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:08.500\nWe also take a look at how to install\nsoftware, how to remove software.\n\n91\n00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:12.110\nThat's kind of daily stuff that\nwe do in using a computer.\n\n92\n00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:14.710\nYou may have a web browser\nthat's your favorite.\n\n93\n00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:17.360\nAnd it doesn't really matter if\nyou're on Windows, or Mac OS or\n\n94\n00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:18.790\nLinux as long as you have\nyour favorite web browser.\n\n95\n00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:21.840\nSo how do we get that installed in Linux,\nhow do we use it and maintain it?\n\n96\n00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.410\nHow do we keep it up to date?\n\n97\n00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:26.696\nThose are all things that we're gonna\ntake a look at right here in Linux for\n\n98\n00:04:26.696 --> 00:04:27.283\nbeginners.\n\n99\n00:04:27.283 --> 00:04:30.544\n&gt;&gt; Well, if this series sounds like\nsomething you'd be interested in, and\n\n100\n00:04:30.544 --> 00:04:34.026\nit should be, you wanna check out Linux\nfor Beginners, thanks for watching.\n\n101\n00:04:34.026 --> 00:04:39.600\n[MUSIC]\n\n",
