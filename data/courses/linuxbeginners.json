All right, so Linux for beginners,\na series we decided to create.\n\n7\n00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:21.970\nIt's really not built around\na structured process,\n\n8\n00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:26.868\nlike normally it's really just designed\nto help people get started with Linux.\n\n9\n00:00:26.868 --> 00:00:31.429\nAnd a lot of people out there have not\nused Linux even one single moment.\n\n10\n00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:32.368\nBut you hear about it.\n\n11\n00:00:32.368 --> 00:00:33.585\nIt sounds really interesting.\n\n12\n00:00:33.585 --> 00:00:36.090\nIt makes you seem really\ncool if you use it, right?\n\n13\n00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.630\nSo people want to get that experience.\n\n14\n00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:41.450\nAnd unfortunately, most of the training\nthat's out there jumps into\n\n15\n00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:43.980\nthe higher level, it expects you to\nhave a lot of previous knowledge.\n\n16\n00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.600\nSo we wanted to create\na series that didn't\n\n17\n00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.270\nrequire a lot of previous knowledge.\n\n18\n00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.640\nIt could let you hop in and start to learn\nabout what the Linux operating system is.\n\n19\n00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:53.420\nWhere it came from.\n\n20\n00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.120\nAnd get a chance to see how you can\nuse it or even if you should use it.\n\n21\n00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.120\nBecause it's not right for everybody and\nyou might need to know it.\n\n22\n00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.840\nCan you determine that?\n\n23\n00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.264\nShould I even bother looking at a Linux?\n\n24\n00:01:03.264 --> 00:01:05.108\nAnd this course is really\ndesigned to help with that.\n\n25\n00:01:05.108 --> 00:01:09.045\nIt's designed to be your first step in\nthe direction of learning to use the Linux\n\n26\n00:01:09.045 --> 00:01:10.939\noperating system as your primary OS.\n\n27\n00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:13.473\n&gt;&gt; Now who would benefit most\nfrom watching this series?\n\n28\n00:01:13.473 --> 00:01:16.796\n&gt;&gt; This series is absolutely geared\ntowards people with zero Linux\n\n29\n00:01:16.796 --> 00:01:18.110\nknowledge, right?\n\n30\n00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.730\nSo if you've never even installed Linux or\nmaybe this overview\n\n31\n00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:25.530\nis the very first time you've heard\nof the Linux operating system.\n\n32\n00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.220\nThen Linux for\nBeginners is gonna be perfect for you.\n\n33\n00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.090\nBecause we're gonna walk you through the\nprocess of understanding how the OS works\n\n34\n00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:33.120\nand how to use it.\n\n35\n00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.400\nAnd it can be intimidating.\n\n36\n00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.430\nYou go online and you see people all these\nshell scripts and doing programming.\n\n37\n00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:41.050\nIt doesn't start there, right?\n\n38\n00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.940\nIt starts with a graphically user\ninterface and being able to click around,\n\n39\n00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.180\nbeing able to run applications, and\ndo the things that you're used to.\n\n40\n00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.110\nMaybe you already use Microsoft Windows or\n\n41\n00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.710\nyou use Apple's Mac OS and\nyou know how those work.\n\n42\n00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.480\nWell, a lot of that knowledge can transfer\nright over into using Linux as well.\n\n43\n00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:01.380\nThere's a lot of similarities between\nthem, so that's where we'd get started.\n\n44\n00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.960\nIf you've already got a reasonable\nexperience with Linux,\n\n45\n00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.540\nif you've been using it even just\nas a hobbyist for a few months,\n\n46\n00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.370\nthen you've probably already got\nthe knowledge of this series.\n\n47\n00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:12.740\nAnd you probably wanna skip past and\ngo to one of our more advanced show.\n\n48\n00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.690\nBut if you've never used Linux,\nthis show is for you.\n\n49\n00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.400\n&gt;&gt; Is there a certification available for\nthis course?\n\n50\n00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.860\n&gt;&gt; No, we chose not to follow\na certification on this one,\n\n51\n00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.090\nbecause a lot of certifications are built\naround more advanced knowledge.\n\n52\n00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.680\nAnd we wanted to tailor\nthis towards the beginner.\n\n53\n00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.895\nSo don't worry about a test.\n\n54\n00:02:28.895 --> 00:02:30.770\nThere's no quiz on Monday, right?\n\n55\n00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:33.760\nIt's just getting you comfortable,\ngetting you where you're ready to learn.\n\n56\n00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.000\nAnd once you get through this and\n\n57\n00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.150\nyou become comfortable with the operating\nsystem and you're able to use it.\n\n58\n00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.440\nThen you can start focusing\non the more advanced topics.\n\n59\n00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.068\nAnd you can look at things like\nCompTIA Linux+ certification or LPIC-1 or\n\n60\n00:02:44.068 --> 00:02:47.307\nany of the other number of Linux\ncertifications that are out there.\n\n61\n00:02:47.307 --> 00:02:50.956\nBut at the beginner stage,\ndon't worry about certifications yet.\n\n62\n00:02:50.956 --> 00:02:53.268\nJust worry about getting\ncomfortable with the OS.\n\n63\n00:02:53.268 --> 00:02:55.782\n&gt;&gt; Now what kind of topics\nare covered in Linux for beginners?\n\n64\n00:02:55.782 --> 00:02:59.683\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\nthis show it's kind of a living project,\n\n65\n00:02:59.683 --> 00:03:02.430\nwe're always adding more stuff to it.\n\n66\n00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.190\nSo as we get feedback from users who say,\n\n67\n00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.460\nboy I'd really like to learn\nhow to do x or y or whatever.\n\n68\n00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:10.160\nWe'll film content and put it in there.\n\n69\n00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.906\nBut at a basics, we're gonna\nstart off with a history lesson.\n\n70\n00:03:12.906 --> 00:03:15.990\nRight, so, where did the Linux\noperating system come from?\n\n71\n00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.830\nWho created it?\n\n72\n00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:18.370\nWhy is it free?\n\n73\n00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:22.560\nThat kind of stuff cuz it seems really\nodd, don't they have to make money?\n\n74\n00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.590\nSo we talk a little about that,\nwhere Linux came from.\n\n75\n00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:29.250\nAnd then, we start to take\na look at how Linux works.\n\n76\n00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.740\nWe take a look at the desktop, and\nthe various desktops, cuz there's many,\n\n77\n00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:36.850\nmany different graphical user interfaces,\nand desktops, and windows managers,\n\n78\n00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:39.710\nand desktop compositors that you can use.\n\n79\n00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:43.040\nNow, some of those words I just used\nyou might not be familiar with,\n\n80\n00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.720\nwe explain that.\n\n81\n00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:48.190\nHow everything fits together to create\nwhat you see on your screen and\n\n82\n00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:49.448\nthe choices that are out there.\n\n83\n00:03:49.448 --> 00:03:52.557\nMan, it just amazing cuz you\nmight hate one window manager.\n\n84\n00:03:52.557 --> 00:03:54.634\nAnd you love another one, so switch.\n\n85\n00:03:54.634 --> 00:03:55.830\nIt's easy.\nIt's easy to do.\n\n86\n00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:58.652\nIt's not like Windows where\nyou have one Window manager or\n\n87\n00:03:58.652 --> 00:04:00.550\nMac OS where you have one Window manager.\n\n88\n00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:02.500\nOn Linux, you have a ton, you can pick.\n\n89\n00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.490\nSo we introduce you to that.\n\n90\n00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:08.500\nWe also take a look at how to install\nsoftware, how to remove software.\n\n91\n00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:12.110\nThat's kind of daily stuff that\nwe do in using a computer.\n\n92\n00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:14.710\nYou may have a web browser\nthat's your favorite.\n\n93\n00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:17.360\nAnd it doesn't really matter if\nyou're on Windows, or Mac OS or\n\n94\n00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:18.790\nLinux as long as you have\nyour favorite web browser.\n\n95\n00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:21.840\nSo how do we get that installed in Linux,\nhow do we use it and maintain it?\n\n96\n00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.410\nHow do we keep it up to date?\n\n97\n00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:26.696\nThose are all things that we're gonna\ntake a look at right here in Linux for\n\n98\n00:04:26.696 --> 00:04:27.283\nbeginners.\n\n99\n00:04:27.283 --> 00:04:30.544\n&gt;&gt; Well, if this series sounds like\nsomething you'd be interested in, and\n\n100\n00:04:30.544 --> 00:04:34.026\nit should be, you wanna check out Linux\nfor Beginners, thanks for watching.\n\n101\n00:04:34.026 --> 00:04:39.600\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

episode,\n\n8\n00:00:20.725 --> 00:00:25.310\nwe're gonna be taking a look at how we\nwould go about choosing a distribution.\n\n9\n00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.710\nAnd here to guide us through this\nincredible maze of distributions is Mr.\n\n10\n00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:30.700\nDon Pezet, how you doing, Don?\n\n11\n00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:33.120\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great, Mike,\nI'm really excited about this episode,\n\n12\n00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.020\ncuz this is one of the most\nfun topics to talk about.\n\n13\n00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.570\nWhen you decide to make that plunge,\nI'm gonna run Linux!\n\n14\n00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.796\nIt's not as easy as just going and saying,\nI'm gonna grab Linux and install it,\n\n15\n00:00:44.796 --> 00:00:47.172\nbecause there's so many options out there.\n\n16\n00:00:47.172 --> 00:00:50.196\nIn the Linux world we have what\nare called distributions, and\n\n17\n00:00:50.196 --> 00:00:52.850\ndistributions are a lot\ndifferent than any other OS.\n\n18\n00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.870\nIf I want to go get Mac OS,\nthere's one version of it.\n\n19\n00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.258\nWell, I guess there's old versions and\nnew versions, but\n\n20\n00:00:59.258 --> 00:01:00.901\nyou're gonna get one current version.\n\n21\n00:01:00.901 --> 00:01:04.093\nIf I wanna get Windows, well,\nthere's two versions of it,\n\n22\n00:01:04.093 --> 00:01:07.237\nthere's the server and\nthe workstation, and that's it.\n\n23\n00:01:07.237 --> 00:01:13.396\nBut, in the Linux world, there are\nhundreds of different versions of Linux.\n\n24\n00:01:13.396 --> 00:01:17.886\nAnd these are called distributions, where\npeople have taken the Linux kernel and\n\n25\n00:01:17.886 --> 00:01:21.285\npackaged software with it to\ncreate a full operating system.\n\n26\n00:01:21.285 --> 00:01:24.773\nAnd different people do\nit different ways and\n\n27\n00:01:24.773 --> 00:01:28.269\nwhat you end up with is\na wide field of choice.\n\n28\n00:01:28.269 --> 00:01:31.469\nWhich is good because you can\nget something that's exactly\n\n29\n00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:35.573\nthe way you like it, if you know what you\nlike [LAUGH] and if you know it exists.\n\n30\n00:01:35.573 --> 00:01:37.275\nI mean,\nit is a massive field of confusion so\n\n31\n00:01:37.275 --> 00:01:39.903\nthat's what we're gonna take a look\nat right here in this episode.\n\n32\n00:01:39.903 --> 00:01:42.565\nIs what are some of the main\ndistributions out there, and\n\n33\n00:01:42.565 --> 00:01:44.735\nhow we go about even\npicking one to start with.\n\n34\n00:01:44.735 --> 00:01:46.900\n&gt;&gt; That would be my first question then,\nDon.\n\n35\n00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:51.401\nDo I have to scour the web and look for\nthese distributions in dark corners?\n\n36\n00:01:51.401 --> 00:01:55.188\nOr is there maybe somewhere I can\ngo to see all these distributions?\n\n37\n00:01:55.188 --> 00:01:55.817\n&gt;&gt; You can do both.\n\n38\n00:01:55.817 --> 00:01:59.992\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So I've used Linux for a long time,\n\n39\n00:01:59.992 --> 00:02:02.671\nI first got introduced to the Linux,\n\n40\n00:02:02.671 --> 00:02:07.696\nI mentioned the first episode how\nLinux really started in 1991.\n\n41\n00:02:07.696 --> 00:02:10.604\nI didn't use it in 1991,\nI wasn't that cool, but\n\n42\n00:02:10.604 --> 00:02:12.700\n1994 is when I started with Linux.\n\n43\n00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.430\nSo not too long after it was out, and\nat the time, it was a heck of a lot\n\n44\n00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.390\neasier cuz there were two or\nthree main distributions and that was it.\n\n45\n00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.990\nSo everybody was kind of picking between\nthese three distros that were out there.\n\n46\n00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:30.250\nWell, now there are tons,\nhundreds, thousands.\n\n47\n00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.450\nSometimes companies will create a custom\nversion of Linux just for use inside of\n\n48\n00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.400\nthat company, these are private distros\nthat don't even make it to the Internet.\n\n49\n00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.162\nSo if you're crawling around the deep\ncorners of the Internet like Mike\n\n50\n00:02:40.162 --> 00:02:44.050\nmentioned, you may find many distributions\nare out there that are very,\n\n51\n00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.939\nvery specific.\n\n52\n00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:48.031\nFor example, what is the one,\nI'm drawing a blank,\n\n53\n00:02:48.031 --> 00:02:51.985\nit used to be the Xbox media center,\nXBMC, they changed the name.\n\n54\n00:02:51.985 --> 00:02:54.113\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I can't think of it,\nI know what you're talking about.\n\n55\n00:02:54.113 --> 00:02:55.670\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well whatever that one is,\n\n56\n00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.440\nwhere here's a version of Linux that they\nmade specifically for video streaming.\n\n57\n00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:04.640\nYou hook it up to your TV, you wouldn't\nwanna use it as your daily computer, but\n\n58\n00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.690\nit's great hooked up to a TV for\nentertainment.\n\n59\n00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.030\nYou get specialized versions\nof Linux like that,\n\n60\n00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.130\nthat are really good at what they do.\n\n61\n00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.101\nBut not necessarily something that\nyou'd want to run on a normal computer.\n\n62\n00:03:15.101 --> 00:03:18.590\nSo on a normal computer though,\nyou can go to sites like,\n\n63\n00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.810\none of the sites I always\nrecommend is DistroWatch.\n\n64\n00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:26.525\nDistroWatch, I've got the website pulled\nup here, DistroWatch.com, this guy.\n\n65\n00:03:26.525 --> 00:03:28.862\nIt's a neat website,\nwebsite's kinda cluttered, so\n\n66\n00:03:28.862 --> 00:03:31.480\nit's a little intimidating\nwhen you first go here.\n\n67\n00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.150\nBut what they do is they\nactually try to catalog\n\n68\n00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.170\nall the Linux distributions\nthat are out there.\n\n69\n00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:41.608\nNow, be aware that some distributions\nare very stable, mature,\n\n70\n00:03:41.608 --> 00:03:45.502\nsupported by companies that\nhave been around 20 years.\n\n71\n00:03:45.502 --> 00:03:48.841\nOther distributions were released\nby a high school kid last week, and\n\n72\n00:03:48.841 --> 00:03:51.450\nthey won't be around a month from now.\n\n73\n00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:55.558\nBecause anybody can create a distribution,\nthat means there's gonna be some good,\n\n74\n00:03:55.558 --> 00:03:59.052\nthere's gonna be a lot of bad, and\nthere's gonna be tons of in between.\n\n75\n00:03:59.052 --> 00:04:03.330\nSo it is important that we make good\nchoices when we go to pick a distro.\n\n76\n00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:08.590\nNow, if I just said, hey, here's the list\nof distributions, it's intimidating.\n\n77\n00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:11.245\nOn the DistroWatch website,\nthey have this kind of neat thing.\n\n78\n00:04:11.245 --> 00:04:14.648\nIt's called the Linux family tree,\nand what they did is,\n\n79\n00:04:14.648 --> 00:04:18.090\nthey created a graphic,\none of the users on DistroWatch.\n\n80\n00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.997\nYou can go to their website,\nit's distrowatch.com/ I guess that's not\n\n81\n00:04:21.997 --> 00:04:24.609\nan easy URL,\nI'll put the link in the show notes.\n\n82\n00:04:24.609 --> 00:04:26.999\nBut [LAUGH] you can go and\nview the family tree, and\n\n83\n00:04:26.999 --> 00:04:30.710\nthey actually list all the distributions\nthat they are aware of.\n\n84\n00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:38.270\nAnd if you look at this list, it is\nmassive, it just goes on and on and on.\n\n85\n00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:42.490\nWell, its kinda zoomed out here,\nlet me flip to a local copy, here, so\n\n86\n00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:43.990\nwe can see it a little bit better.\n\n87\n00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:48.698\nAnd as you scroll down here,\nwhat you're going to notice is,\n\n88\n00:04:48.698 --> 00:04:51.662\nthere a ton of these distributions\nthat are out and about.\n\n89\n00:04:51.662 --> 00:04:54.531\n&gt;&gt; So, each one of those\ncolored dots is a distribution?\n\n90\n00:04:54.531 --> 00:04:58.255\nYes, each dot represents a distribution,\nand\n\n91\n00:04:58.255 --> 00:05:03.481\nnotice how some of them go on really\nlong lines, like the zencafe.\n\n92\n00:05:03.481 --> 00:05:06.021\nFor the record, I've never heard\nof zencafe prior to this moment.\n\n93\n00:05:06.021 --> 00:05:07.908\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But it's been going on,\n\n94\n00:05:07.908 --> 00:05:11.220\neach of these dark grey lines represents\na year, so for years and years,\n\n95\n00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:12.483\nthis one's been going on.\n\n96\n00:05:12.483 --> 00:05:17.142\nOther ones, though, like if you look at\nSlamPP, which, again, never heard of it,\n\n97\n00:05:17.142 --> 00:05:20.590\nit went on for three years and\nthen stopped receiving updates.\n\n98\n00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:26.269\nSometimes people have a great idea for\ndistribution, and they launch it, and\n\n99\n00:05:26.269 --> 00:05:28.332\nit's popular for a little while.\n\n100\n00:05:28.332 --> 00:05:32.427\nBut over time, people's needs change,\nand things start to dwindle, and\n\n101\n00:05:32.427 --> 00:05:34.780\neventually stop being supported.\n\n102\n00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:37.770\nAnd when they stop being supported,\nyou don't wanna run them anymore,\n\n103\n00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:40.282\nbecause that means they're\nnot getting security updates.\n\n104\n00:05:40.282 --> 00:05:44.130\nSo if you continue to run an unsupported\nOS, you're gonna be in trouble.\n\n105\n00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:47.780\nThat's why it's important that we pick\nones that are stable, that are mature,\n\n106\n00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:49.330\nthat are gonna be around awhile.\n\n107\n00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:51.943\nOr you might not have a choice,\nyou might have some very specific need.\n\n108\n00:05:51.943 --> 00:05:54.977\nLook at this guy right here,\nlive CD router, and\n\n109\n00:05:54.977 --> 00:05:59.010\nit didn't even go on a single year,\nmaybe six months.\n\n110\n00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:01.550\nThis, more than likely,\nhaven't heard of this one,\n\n111\n00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:06.110\nbut based on its name, was probably\na version of Linux designed to run on\n\n112\n00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:07.740\na specific piece of router hardware.\n\n113\n00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:12.090\nRouters usually are only sold for about\na year or two before they stop anyway, so\n\n114\n00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:14.190\nthat hardware probably\nstopped being supported.\n\n115\n00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:15.902\nNo need to keep maintaining that OS,\n\n116\n00:06:15.902 --> 00:06:18.233\nbecause the hardware's\nnot available anymore.\n\n117\n00:06:18.233 --> 00:06:22.271\nSo, there times where you need that\nkind of specific Linux distribution, but\n\n118\n00:06:22.271 --> 00:06:26.410\nnormally you want something stable,\nand there's plenty that are stable.\n\n119\n00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:28.948\nEven these shorter ones here that have\nbeen around for three years, well,\n\n120\n00:06:28.948 --> 00:06:30.695\nyou normally get a new\ncomputer every three years.\n\n121\n00:06:30.695 --> 00:06:35.817\nSo, that's a good life cycle, but notice\nhow most of these aren't just starting\n\n122\n00:06:35.817 --> 00:06:40.732\nout on their own, they've got a tail\nthat's running down to something else.\n\n123\n00:06:40.732 --> 00:06:43.610\nLook at this yellow line,\nthat's running across the bottom here.\n\n124\n00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:48.110\nThat yellow line represents\na distribution, and\n\n125\n00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:51.860\nthat distribution, in this case,\nlet's see who it is.\n\n126\n00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:54.975\nIf I scroll all the way left,\nit's Slackware, Slackware is\n\n127\n00:06:54.975 --> 00:06:59.449\none of the original Linux distributions,\nit's actually the one that I started with.\n\n128\n00:06:59.449 --> 00:07:03.481\nSo back in 1994, Slackware was\nthe first Linux that I installed.\n\n129\n00:07:03.481 --> 00:07:07.962\nI had a friend of mine,\nat the time, I was running,\n\n130\n00:07:07.962 --> 00:07:13.080\nI was either running OS2 or\nDeskview X, one or the other.\n\n131\n00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:17.470\nI think I was running OS2 at the time, and\nhe called me, it was my friend Nick, and\n\n132\n00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:20.370\nhe said, Don, you've gotta try Linux.\n\n133\n00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:22.881\nIt's got X Windows on it,\nand the multitasking on it,\n\n134\n00:07:22.881 --> 00:07:24.362\nit'll make you pee your pants.\n\n135\n00:07:24.362 --> 00:07:25.422\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I remember to this day,\n\n136\n00:07:25.422 --> 00:07:27.193\nthat's exactly what he said,\nit'll make you pee your pants.\n\n137\n00:07:27.193 --> 00:07:29.434\nAnd I said what, I wanna pee my pants.\n\n138\n00:07:29.434 --> 00:07:32.529\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So I went and I downloaded Slackware.\n\n139\n00:07:32.529 --> 00:07:35.266\nAnd what Slackware did is,\nthey took the Linux kernel, and\n\n140\n00:07:35.266 --> 00:07:36.651\nthen they took the software.\n\n141\n00:07:36.651 --> 00:07:40.183\nAnd they broke the software up into\nthese nice, easy-to-download chunks,\n\n142\n00:07:40.183 --> 00:07:42.816\nthat were exactly the size that\nwould fit on a floppy disc.\n\n143\n00:07:42.816 --> 00:07:46.120\nCuz we all used floppy disks back then,\nand it was neat, because if you\n\n144\n00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:50.221\nwanted the games, there were three floppy\ndisk images you downloaded, of the games.\n\n145\n00:07:50.221 --> 00:07:52.547\nAnd if you wanted\nthe word-processing suite,\n\n146\n00:07:52.547 --> 00:07:54.532\nthere were floppy disk images for that.\n\n147\n00:07:54.532 --> 00:07:59.035\nSo you picked the images you wanted,\nwe were downloading these over 2800 broad\n\n148\n00:07:59.035 --> 00:08:03.948\nmodems, I'm sorry, 2400 I might have had\na 288 by that point by I don't think so.\n\n149\n00:08:03.948 --> 00:08:05.715\nSo these were slow modems and so\n\n150\n00:08:05.715 --> 00:08:10.120\nit was nice to be able to download\non floppy that made it easy to get.\n\n151\n00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:12.850\nAnd Slackware is still around today.\n\n152\n00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:15.080\nIt's been around for over 20 years.\n\n153\n00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:19.530\nAnd they pride themselves in being\nas close to true Linux as possible.\n\n154\n00:08:19.530 --> 00:08:22.435\nThere is no true Linux cuz\nLinux is just the kernel.\n\n155\n00:08:22.435 --> 00:08:26.322\nAnd there's all this other stuff we add\non to it so they try and be as clean and\n\n156\n00:08:26.322 --> 00:08:27.330\ntrue as possible.\n\n157\n00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:33.270\nNow, the true part really is they're\nnot making decisions for us.\n\n158\n00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:36.380\nIn some of the other distro's,\nthey're making decisions for you.\n\n159\n00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:40.820\nThey're changing some things based\non their opinion on what is right\n\n160\n00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:43.510\nSlackware tries not to do that, they just,\nthey fill the software in there the way it\n\n161\n00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:46.180\nwas originally designed and\nthey turn you loose on it.\n\n162\n00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:50.600\nAnd, as a result, Slackware serves as\nthe basis for a number of distros.\n\n163\n00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:56.390\nSo you see, back in the diagram,\nwhere Slackware then branches out.\n\n164\n00:08:56.390 --> 00:08:57.620\nAnd it splits out.\n\n165\n00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:02.680\nAnd all these other distros on my screen,\nstart with slack ware.\n\n166\n00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:07.430\nSo somebody had an idea to start\nan operating system called Plamo, right?\n\n167\n00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:09.620\nNever heard of Plamo, but\nsomebody wanted to create it.\n\n168\n00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:13.310\nAnd they said instead of starting from\nscratch, we're gonna take Slackware and\n\n169\n00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:16.840\nnow will modify it to match our needs,\nand we'll rename it Plamo.\n\n170\n00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:17.830\nAnd that's how they released it.\n\n171\n00:09:17.830 --> 00:09:21.060\nAnd so now it's forked from\nthe Slackware project.\n\n172\n00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:26.630\nIf you look at the tree,\nyou kinda zoom out on the tree,\n\n173\n00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:30.090\nyou see all those Slackware\nbased distros right there.\n\n174\n00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:35.910\nAnd if I scroll down,\nhere's a bunch that are forked from\n\n175\n00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:40.570\na Distro called Fedora and\nif we keep scrolling down Fedora\n\n176\n00:09:40.570 --> 00:09:46.050\nitself is forked from\na Distro called Red Hat.\n\n177\n00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:49.415\nRed Hat is one of the core\ndistributions that's out there.\n\n178\n00:09:49.415 --> 00:09:53.380\nSlackware is one of the core distributions\nand the third one is Debian.\n\n179\n00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:57.990\nIf I scroll down a little further\nthe Debian one will blow your mind.\n\n180\n00:09:57.990 --> 00:10:02.127\nHere's all the ones that\nare forked from Debian.\n\n181\n00:10:02.127 --> 00:10:02.655\n&gt;&gt; Wow [LAUGH].\n\n182\n00:10:02.655 --> 00:10:03.855\nI'm half way through,\nlet me just keep going.\n\n183\n00:10:03.855 --> 00:10:05.010\n[LAUGH] Right.\n\n184\n00:10:05.010 --> 00:10:07.150\nIt is a massive list.\n\n185\n00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:12.530\nThese all come from Debian, right?\n\n186\n00:10:12.530 --> 00:10:14.790\nDebian is short for Deborah and Ian.\n\n187\n00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:17.050\nIt is two people, a husband and\nwife, they created,\n\n188\n00:10:17.050 --> 00:10:18.580\nI don't know if they were husband or wife.\n\n189\n00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:19.690\nBut they were a couple.\n\n190\n00:10:19.690 --> 00:10:20.555\nWell, either way.\n\n191\n00:10:20.555 --> 00:10:23.110\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; A couple that created\n\n192\n00:10:23.110 --> 00:10:24.220\nthe operating system.\n\n193\n00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:29.700\nAnd they basically made it as\nfriendly as possible for developers.\n\n194\n00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:30.990\nThey said if you wanna be a programmer,\n\n195\n00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:34.990\nwe're gonna put all the programming tools\nright here in the base distro ready to go\n\n196\n00:10:34.990 --> 00:10:38.490\nright next to the kernel and all the other\nstuff and it's gonna be super easy to use.\n\n197\n00:10:38.490 --> 00:10:41.963\nAnd programmers loved it and anytime\nsomebody wanted to create a distro,\n\n198\n00:10:41.963 --> 00:10:45.449\nthat was a great one to base on cuz you\nknew it had the tools that you wanted.\n\n199\n00:10:45.449 --> 00:10:50.487\nWell, over time, a company called\nCanonical used Debian as the basis for\n\n200\n00:10:50.487 --> 00:10:54.560\ntheir operating system called Ubuntu,\nwhich I will find.\n\n201\n00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:56.270\nRight here.\nHere's Ubuntu.\n\n202\n00:10:56.270 --> 00:11:00.680\nAnd ubuntu took Debian and said,\nyeah, yeah, programmers are great.\n\n203\n00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:02.110\nBut so are end users.\n\n204\n00:11:02.110 --> 00:11:06.630\nSo let's take that nice stable\nOS that programmers love, and\n\n205\n00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:10.130\nlet's, I'm gonna talk\na little bad about Ubuntu.\n\n206\n00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:12.020\nFor the record,\nI'm running Ubuntu on my laptop right now.\n\n207\n00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:13.110\nSo let me just say that.\n\n208\n00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:16.486\nBut they didn't say, well, junk it up with\nall this stuff end users want, right?\n\n209\n00:11:16.486 --> 00:11:19.855\nIt was pretty much a crappy web\nbrowsers and other things in there, and\n\n210\n00:11:19.855 --> 00:11:21.460\nmake it easy for end users.\n\n211\n00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:23.654\nAnd while I make fun of that,\nthere's a lot of value.\n\n212\n00:11:23.654 --> 00:11:26.690\nAnd you can see that that value because\nlook at how many distros base themselves\n\n213\n00:11:26.690 --> 00:11:27.680\noff of Ubuntu?\n\n214\n00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:30.760\nRight, and Ubuntu is live today, right?\n\n215\n00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:33.290\nIt is running full steam.\n\n216\n00:11:33.290 --> 00:11:37.200\nI think I just took\nan update two days ago, so\n\n217\n00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:41.090\nI mean, it's fully active and it's one of\nthe big distros that are out there today.\n\n218\n00:11:41.090 --> 00:11:45.210\nBut a lot of people don't realize that\nUbuntu itself Is based on Debian, so\n\n219\n00:11:45.210 --> 00:11:49.200\nit's reliant on another distribution,\nit's called and upstream distribution.\n\n220\n00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:52.300\nWhen an update happens\nin the Debian world,\n\n221\n00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:55.390\nthe update trickles downstream to Ubuntu.\n\n222\n00:11:55.390 --> 00:11:59.500\nAnd then it goes downstream to all these\nother distributions that we see that\n\n223\n00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:04.100\nare forking off into they\nreceive updates from there.\n\n224\n00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:07.318\nSo, the updates kind of travel down or\ntrickle down.\n\n225\n00:12:07.318 --> 00:12:09.510\n&gt;&gt; Very cool Don.\n\n226\n00:12:09.510 --> 00:12:13.660\nBut I've noticed on there that most of\nthem are branches of what you say the big\n\n227\n00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:16.840\nthree, but there are some that just\nstart in the middle of nowhere.\n\n228\n00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:17.730\nWhat are those guys?\n\n229\n00:12:17.730 --> 00:12:18.910\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, let's find somebody.\n\n230\n00:12:18.910 --> 00:12:23.070\nIt gets kind of hard to find them because\nthere are so many, but you will find,\n\n231\n00:12:23.070 --> 00:12:26.340\nhere, some that do just start right\nin the middle of nowhere, right?\n\n232\n00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:28.890\nOpenbsd, there it is,\nin the middle of nowhere.\n\n233\n00:12:28.890 --> 00:12:34.900\nOkay, what that means is that they didn't\nuse somebody else as the basis for their\n\n234\n00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:41.310\noperating system, then instead, they took\nthe Linux kernel or an alternative kernel.\n\n235\n00:12:41.310 --> 00:12:45.690\nOpen BSD actually uses the BSD kernel from\nBerkley which is based on the UNIX kernel.\n\n236\n00:12:45.690 --> 00:12:49.660\nSo they took their own kernel,\nor the Linux kernel, and\n\n237\n00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:54.650\npackaged software with it on their own and\nthey created their own distribution.\n\n238\n00:12:54.650 --> 00:12:59.650\nNow couple of things to think about\nbefore you choose one of those distros.\n\n239\n00:12:59.650 --> 00:13:03.242\nIt's very very hard to build\nyour own distro from scratch.\n\n240\n00:13:03.242 --> 00:13:04.690\nYou can do it.\n\n241\n00:13:04.690 --> 00:13:09.500\nThe hard part is not building it, again\nyou could probably do it in a day or two.\n\n242\n00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:11.690\nThe hard part is keeping it up to date.\n\n243\n00:13:11.690 --> 00:13:14.850\nIf you have 1000 packages in\nthere all little software pieces,\n\n244\n00:13:14.850 --> 00:13:16.280\nyou can keep everyone up to date.\n\n245\n00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:18.620\nAnd if one breaks another package,\nyou've gotta figure that out and\n\n246\n00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:19.180\nget it sorted out.\n\n247\n00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:20.330\nAnd you've gotta maintain that.\n\n248\n00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:22.480\nIt's a lot of work.\n\n249\n00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:26.420\nWhen Ubuntu based themselves off of\nDebian, Debian was already doing\n\n250\n00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:29.710\na lot that legwork, and so\nthey benefited and they added packages.\n\n251\n00:13:29.710 --> 00:13:32.020\nNow they just had to maintain\nthe packages they added, right?\n\n252\n00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:34.500\nAnd that's why they normally base\nthemselves on another distro,\n\n253\n00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:36.570\nas opposed to starting from scratch.\n\n254\n00:13:36.570 --> 00:13:38.930\nBut, there are advantages\nto starting from scratch.\n\n255\n00:13:38.930 --> 00:13:43.697\nOpenBSD, they used to have on\ntheir homepage where it said,\n\n256\n00:13:43.697 --> 00:13:48.753\nonly two remote exploits in\nthe base install in over 15 years.\n\n257\n00:13:48.753 --> 00:13:52.239\nAnd then over time,\nthey changed it to say over star years or\n\n258\n00:13:52.239 --> 00:13:55.120\nsomething cuz they just\nstopped keeping count.\n\n259\n00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:58.050\nAnd now, I think it just says\nlike a wildly secure OS.\n\n260\n00:13:58.050 --> 00:14:02.710\nTheir OS is designed with security\nin mind at the very base level.\n\n261\n00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:05.890\nSo it is probably one of the more\nsecure OS's you could deploy.\n\n262\n00:14:05.890 --> 00:14:09.173\nAnd in order to maintain that security\nthey couldn't base it off of somebody\n\n263\n00:14:09.173 --> 00:14:12.625\nelse's distro because nobody else was\nfanatic about security like they were.\n\n264\n00:14:12.625 --> 00:14:15.240\nRight, so they said screw it,\nwe're gonna do it on our own.\n\n265\n00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:20.406\nWe're gonna start from scratch they could\nhave based it off of FreeBSD or NetBSD.\n\n266\n00:14:20.406 --> 00:14:22.984\nThey could have based it off of any\nof the Linux distros, but instead,\n\n267\n00:14:22.984 --> 00:14:23.955\nthey went their own path.\n\n268\n00:14:23.955 --> 00:14:25.260\nAnd they've been very successful.\n\n269\n00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:30.400\nIf you look at OpenBSD, it has been around\nfor many, many years, and is active today.\n\n270\n00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:33.150\nBut there's a lot of people\nthat jump in and say, hey,\n\n271\n00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:36.230\nI'm gonna create a variation,\nlike BSD anywhere.\n\n272\n00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:37.930\nAnd it trickles off a few years later.\n\n273\n00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:39.400\nIt becomes to difficult to maintain.\n\n274\n00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:41.640\nPeople lose interest in the distro.\n\n275\n00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:43.280\nSo when you pick a distribution,\n\n276\n00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:46.770\nwhen you pick your first distribution if\nyou're just getting started with Linux,\n\n277\n00:14:46.770 --> 00:14:50.220\ndon't pick somebody who's a dot\nin the middle of nowhere.\n\n278\n00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:53.900\nI'm not saying it's a bad distro, but\nit's gonna be a tough one to learn on.\n\n279\n00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:54.720\nIt's too new.\n\n280\n00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:57.840\nThere's gonna be significant changes\nthat's not gonna be comparable to a lot of\n\n281\n00:14:57.840 --> 00:14:58.640\nthe other OSs.\n\n282\n00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:00.060\nIt's gonna be a lot of obstacles.\n\n283\n00:15:00.060 --> 00:15:01.771\nAfter you become more\ncomfortable with Linux,\n\n284\n00:15:01.771 --> 00:15:03.145\nyou become more of a power user right?\n\n285\n00:15:03.145 --> 00:15:06.650\nAnd at that point, yeah you can run\nwhatever distro you want, right?\n\n286\n00:15:06.650 --> 00:15:07.370\nAt the end of the day,\n\n287\n00:15:07.370 --> 00:15:10.940\nthey're all gonna have a fairly\nsimilar command set inside of it.\n\n288\n00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:12.850\nThe GUI might be wildly different.\n\n289\n00:15:12.850 --> 00:15:15.140\nThe permissions might be very different.\n\n290\n00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:17.400\nThat software that's\nincluded might be different.\n\n291\n00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:19.090\nBut when you drop to a terminal,\n\n292\n00:15:19.090 --> 00:15:22.530\nthe commands you run will typically\nbe the same, so you can get by.\n\n293\n00:15:22.530 --> 00:15:26.882\nBut when you're just getting started,\nyou're better off picking, what I like\n\n294\n00:15:26.882 --> 00:15:31.840\nto call the big four, you've got Debian\nand Ubuntu which are technically linked.\n\n295\n00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:35.330\nYou've got Red Hat and\nthen you've got Slackware.\n\n296\n00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:36.000\nRight?\nAnd\n\n297\n00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.900\neven Slackware's become\na little questionable lately.\n\n298\n00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:39.940\nThere's one gentleman,\n\n299\n00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:43.660\nwho's name I can never remember who\nheads up the Slackware project.\n\n300\n00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:46.551\nThousands of people work on Slackware,\nbut there's one guy who heads it up.\n\n301\n00:15:46.551 --> 00:15:50.611\nAnd it's been his life project,\nand now he's up there in years.\n\n302\n00:15:50.611 --> 00:15:52.490\nHe was actually really sick\na couple years ago, so\n\n303\n00:15:52.490 --> 00:15:55.013\nthe future of that project actually\nis a little bit questionable.\n\n304\n00:15:55.013 --> 00:15:56.958\nSo if I were just getting started today,\n\n305\n00:15:56.958 --> 00:15:59.474\nI wouldn't recommend\nSlackware as where to start,\n\n306\n00:15:59.474 --> 00:16:03.667\neven though that's where I started myself,\nbut it was very different 20 years ago.\n\n307\n00:16:03.667 --> 00:16:09.004\nBut Red Hat, Ubuntu, Debian, those guys,\nthey're going to be around a long time.\n\n308\n00:16:09.004 --> 00:16:12.451\nAnd you're seeing some of the most\nactive development in the Ubuntu world.\n\n309\n00:16:12.451 --> 00:16:14.468\nSo it's one of the safer\nones to start with.\n\n310\n00:16:14.468 --> 00:16:18.529\nIt's also very user friendly as far\nas the graphical user interface and\n\n311\n00:16:18.529 --> 00:16:19.890\ngetting in there.\n\n312\n00:16:19.890 --> 00:16:21.122\nBut it's got a server side, too.\n\n313\n00:16:21.122 --> 00:16:22.680\nSo very powerful on that one.\n\n314\n00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:27.070\nAnd Ubuntu is backed by a company called\nCanonical so they have a financial model\n\n315\n00:16:27.070 --> 00:16:29.310\nwhere they generate revenue, and\nthey're able to keep around.\n\n316\n00:16:29.310 --> 00:16:30.860\nSo, you know they're\ngonna be around awhile.\n\n317\n00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:33.440\nSo does Red Hat,\nthey've got the same thing.\n\n318\n00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:36.720\nDebian doesn't,\nthey don't have a commercial version.\n\n319\n00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:41.284\nBut Debian gets a ton of donations from\ncompanies like VMWare, Microsoft, Apple,\n\n320\n00:16:41.284 --> 00:16:41.809\nGoogle.\n\n321\n00:16:41.809 --> 00:16:45.922\nGoogle dumps a ton of money into Debian to\nkeep that operating system developing cuz\n\n322\n00:16:45.922 --> 00:16:47.580\nthey all build off of it, right?\n\n323\n00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:50.971\nThe Chrome books are actually\nrunning variance of the Debian.\n\n324\n00:16:50.971 --> 00:16:56.005\nSo that's an important thing for\nthem to be able to keep that alive.\n\n325\n00:16:56.005 --> 00:16:58.490\nSo those guys you know\nare gonna be around.\n\n326\n00:16:58.490 --> 00:17:00.819\nBut it changes,\ndepending on when you watch this episode,\n\n327\n00:17:00.819 --> 00:17:03.050\nthere may be other ones\nthat have come out or not.\n\n328\n00:17:03.050 --> 00:17:08.630\nSo there's another website on DistroWatch\nthat's the DistroWatch top ten.\n\n329\n00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:12.510\nAnd they show you the top ten\ndistributions by download.\n\n330\n00:17:12.510 --> 00:17:16.840\nSo if you go to their website you can pull\nup the top ten and it's kind of written\n\n331\n00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:21.730\na little small I guess, but you'll see\nthat they list number one as Linux Mint.\n\n332\n00:17:21.730 --> 00:17:25.342\nLinux Mint is a very\nuser-friendly operating system.\n\n333\n00:17:25.342 --> 00:17:29.223\nIt is built off of Ubuntu,\nwhich in turn is built off of Debian.\n\n334\n00:17:29.223 --> 00:17:33.085\nAnd you see a lot of this where\nthey kinda fork like this, but\n\n335\n00:17:33.085 --> 00:17:35.414\nLinux Mint they list as number one.\n\n336\n00:17:35.414 --> 00:17:37.110\nI'm not a big fan of Linux Mint.\n\n337\n00:17:37.110 --> 00:17:41.670\nThey've had a couple of security\nissues over the last few years so\n\n338\n00:17:41.670 --> 00:17:43.210\nI haven't been a big fan of them.\n\n339\n00:17:43.210 --> 00:17:45.060\nBut number two they list is Ubuntu.\n\n340\n00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:48.243\nUbuntu is massive, tons of people use it.\n\n341\n00:17:48.243 --> 00:17:51.422\nIt is built off of Debian so\nyou get the benefits of that.\n\n342\n00:17:51.422 --> 00:17:54.142\nAnd they themselves have\nbeen around since 2004.\n\n343\n00:17:54.142 --> 00:17:55.430\nThey've been around a long time.\n\n344\n00:17:55.430 --> 00:17:59.362\nAnd they are kind of becoming\nthe defacto standard for desktop Linux.\n\n345\n00:17:59.362 --> 00:18:03.795\nIf you're running Linux on your desktop,\nUbuntu is typically the most common.\n\n346\n00:18:03.795 --> 00:18:06.601\nThen we've got Debian itself, right?\n\n347\n00:18:06.601 --> 00:18:09.239\nWhich if you're a developer,\nDebian gives you a wide set of tools.\n\n348\n00:18:09.239 --> 00:18:12.480\nYou've got the same tools in Ubuntu,\nthough, so most people go that route.\n\n349\n00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:14.939\nBut Debian is out there on a server.\n\n350\n00:18:14.939 --> 00:18:16.851\nDebian actually does\na really good job there,\n\n351\n00:18:16.851 --> 00:18:19.019\ncuz you can kind of control\na lot of what goes into it.\n\n352\n00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:22.074\nAfter that we get a couple\nof interesting ones.\n\n353\n00:18:22.074 --> 00:18:25.080\nHere's Mageya,\nwhich I am probably saying wrong.\n\n354\n00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:29.750\nIt's been around,\nit is built off of Mandrake, or\n\n355\n00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:31.910\nwhat eventually became Mandreva.\n\n356\n00:18:31.910 --> 00:18:36.099\nTheir goal is to create a desktop that\nlooks as much like Microsoft Windows as\n\n357\n00:18:36.099 --> 00:18:36.757\npossible.\n\n358\n00:18:36.757 --> 00:18:39.543\nSo, if you're coming from the Windows\nworld, you can jump over here and\n\n359\n00:18:39.543 --> 00:18:40.099\nit works out.\n\n360\n00:18:40.099 --> 00:18:45.488\nNow, they aren't necessarily the greatest\nabout high technical advantage and stuff.\n\n361\n00:18:45.488 --> 00:18:47.790\nIt's really an end user OS.\n\n362\n00:18:47.790 --> 00:18:51.580\nBut it is one that's fairly popular.\n\n363\n00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:54.008\nFedora is another one that's out there,\nand,\n\n364\n00:18:54.008 --> 00:18:57.570\n[LAUGH] Google is really\ngoing with the essay.\n\n365\n00:18:57.570 --> 00:19:00.350\nFedora is from the company Red Hat.\n\n366\n00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:03.310\nNow let's talk a little bit about that,\nthe forks, right?\n\n367\n00:19:03.310 --> 00:19:07.630\nSo, RedHat, these guys, were the first\n\n368\n00:19:07.630 --> 00:19:12.720\npeople to release a commercial version\nof Linux, a pay version of Linux.\n\n369\n00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:15.950\nAnd, I know what you're thinking,\nisn't Linux free?\n\n370\n00:19:15.950 --> 00:19:18.050\nWell, what they did, is they said,\nlook, if you're a company,\n\n371\n00:19:18.050 --> 00:19:19.930\nand you're gonnao run Linux and it's free?\n\n372\n00:19:19.930 --> 00:19:22.140\nAnd something goes wrong, who do you call?\n\n373\n00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:24.260\nNobody, you're out of luck, right?\n\n374\n00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:26.090\nIf something goes wrong\nwith Mac OS you call Apple,\n\n375\n00:19:26.090 --> 00:19:28.330\nsomething goes wrong with\nWindows you call Microsoft.\n\n376\n00:19:28.330 --> 00:19:30.013\nWith Linux, you call nobody.\n\n377\n00:19:30.013 --> 00:19:32.988\nSo they said hey we're gonna offer Linux,\nthe Linux you know and\n\n378\n00:19:32.988 --> 00:19:34.322\nlove and we'll support it.\n\n379\n00:19:34.322 --> 00:19:36.157\nYou can call us, we'll help you.\n\n380\n00:19:36.157 --> 00:19:38.990\nAnd we'll make it available for pay.\n\n381\n00:19:38.990 --> 00:19:43.469\nYou pay to get the support from them, but\nit's the Linux that you know and love.\n\n382\n00:19:43.469 --> 00:19:45.059\nAll right, so that's Red Hat.\n\n383\n00:19:45.059 --> 00:19:48.164\nNow, Red Hat is pay, and\nyou're probably thinking to yourself,\n\n384\n00:19:48.164 --> 00:19:51.540\nI thought if it's open source\nthey can't charge money for it.\n\n385\n00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:55.320\nWell, they can, they can charge money for\nit, but they also have to give it away for\n\n386\n00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:58.354\nfree, and so what they do is they\nrelease the source code for free.\n\n387\n00:19:58.354 --> 00:20:01.500\nAnd there's another company\nout there called CentOS.\n\n388\n00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:05.270\nCentOS stands for the Community\nEnterprise Operating System and\n\n389\n00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:07.930\nthey take the source code from Red Hat.\n\n390\n00:20:07.930 --> 00:20:11.491\nThey remove all the Red Hat logos and\nthey recompile it as CentOS.\n\n391\n00:20:11.491 --> 00:20:15.902\nSo CentOS is Red Hat enterprise Linux,\nthey're the same, right?\n\n392\n00:20:15.902 --> 00:20:17.270\n&gt;&gt; Just without the support.\n\n393\n00:20:17.270 --> 00:20:19.170\n&gt;&gt; No support, completely free.\n\n394\n00:20:19.170 --> 00:20:21.600\nSo you can go and download this\nright now completely free and\n\n395\n00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:23.212\nyou're effectively running Red Hat.\n\n396\n00:20:23.212 --> 00:20:25.800\nThey look the same, well,\nminus the logos, right?\n\n397\n00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:29.760\nBut on the Red Hat side,\nyou can call them up and get support.\n\n398\n00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:34.340\nSo these really just differ based on\nwhether you pay for them or not, right?\n\n399\n00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:38.850\nAnd I'll tell you, for me personally,\nif I'm standing up a server in a business,\n\n400\n00:20:38.850 --> 00:20:41.840\nI almost always use\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux.\n\n401\n00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:47.030\nIt costs money, but you get support, and\nin a business you want that support.\n\n402\n00:20:47.030 --> 00:20:51.460\nNow, on my own laptop, well,\nI run Red Hat on a virtual machine.\n\n403\n00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:53.696\nI have a Red Hat license\nmyself cuz I like it.\n\n404\n00:20:53.696 --> 00:20:57.321\nBut for my regular daily use laptop,\nI don't run Red Hat, and\n\n405\n00:20:57.321 --> 00:21:00.880\nthat's because Red Hat\nfocuses on stability, right?\n\n406\n00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:03.751\nSo there'll be several versions\nbehind on software sometimes,\n\n407\n00:21:03.751 --> 00:21:07.105\neven on the Linux kernel they'll be\nbehind, because they want stability.\n\n408\n00:21:07.105 --> 00:21:10.536\nThey don't want cutting edge, they don't\nwant things that crash every now and then,\n\n409\n00:21:10.536 --> 00:21:11.489\nor act a little quirky.\n\n410\n00:21:11.489 --> 00:21:13.580\nThey want things that are tried and true.\n\n411\n00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:15.690\nSo in a business Red Hat is great.\n\n412\n00:21:15.690 --> 00:21:18.399\nBut on your own computer, you might\nwant something a little more edgy.\n\n413\n00:21:18.399 --> 00:21:22.943\nAnd so with Red Hat,\nthey have the Red Hat Enterprise Linux.\n\n414\n00:21:22.943 --> 00:21:25.522\nThere's CentOS, the free version of it,\nand then there's Fedora,\n\n415\n00:21:25.522 --> 00:21:26.890\nwhat got me on this train of thought.\n\n416\n00:21:26.890 --> 00:21:28.511\nLet me bring up Fedora's website.\n\n417\n00:21:28.511 --> 00:21:31.340\nFedora is also from Red Hat.\n\n418\n00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:33.080\nIt's completely free and\n\n419\n00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:37.380\nit is the bleeding edge of technology,\nall the latest and greatest stuff.\n\n420\n00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:38.940\nSo if you want all\nthe benefits of Red Hat,\n\n421\n00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:41.670\nor running the latest software,\nthis is where you go.\n\n422\n00:21:41.670 --> 00:21:45.450\nWell, that means that yeah, you'll get a\ncouple of crashes every now and then, and\n\n423\n00:21:45.450 --> 00:21:47.190\nthat Fedora is kind of a test bed.\n\n424\n00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:50.327\nWhen software is proven working in Fedora,\n\n425\n00:21:50.327 --> 00:21:54.917\nthen it gets integrated into\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux, right?\n\n426\n00:21:54.917 --> 00:21:58.010\nSo this one will be running the latest and\ngreatest.\n\n427\n00:21:58.010 --> 00:22:01.651\nSo if you wanna run Red Hat as\na daily driver on your regular laptop,\n\n428\n00:22:01.651 --> 00:22:03.418\nFedora is the way to go, right?\n\n429\n00:22:03.418 --> 00:22:06.298\nOn a server, you probably don't\nwanna use Fedora so much.\n\n430\n00:22:06.298 --> 00:22:09.091\nYou'll more than likely stick with\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux or CentOS,\n\n431\n00:22:09.091 --> 00:22:10.530\nthe free version, right?\n\n432\n00:22:10.530 --> 00:22:12.650\nSo that little ecosystem\nthere starts with Red Hat,\n\n433\n00:22:12.650 --> 00:22:16.720\nand then you've got Fedora and\nCentOS that branch off, right?\n\n434\n00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:18.990\nWith the Ubuntu world,\nit really starts with Debian.\n\n435\n00:22:18.990 --> 00:22:21.385\nSo I've got the Debian webpage\npulled up here, Debian.org.\n\n436\n00:22:21.385 --> 00:22:22.643\nYou can go to Debian and download it.\n\n437\n00:22:22.643 --> 00:22:27.763\nThe operating system is really designed\nto work well for developers, right?\n\n438\n00:22:27.763 --> 00:22:31.422\nIf you take a look, see,\nI have Debian running somewhere.\n\n439\n00:22:31.422 --> 00:22:33.417\nWell, let me show you guys.\n\n440\n00:22:33.417 --> 00:22:35.940\nThis is Red Hat Enterprise Linux here.\n\n441\n00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:39.259\nWhen I install\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux on a server,\n\n442\n00:22:39.259 --> 00:22:41.695\nI typically don't install\na graphical user interface, right?\n\n443\n00:22:41.695 --> 00:22:44.980\nBut on a workstation you can, and so\nthis is Red Hat Enterprise Linux.\n\n444\n00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:46.540\nJust a simple menuing structure.\n\n445\n00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:48.479\nYou can go in and run your applications,\n\n446\n00:22:48.479 --> 00:22:52.014\nyou can install whatever is that you need,\nand you can get it up and going,\n\n447\n00:22:52.014 --> 00:22:56.090\nand functioning, and that's basically it,\nlike what you'd expect.\n\n448\n00:22:56.090 --> 00:23:01.180\nWhen you install Debian, you'll see\nthat it's pretty similar, right?\n\n449\n00:23:01.180 --> 00:23:06.255\nI get in here, I punch in the password,\nI get a desktop, I can pull up my menus.\n\n450\n00:23:06.255 --> 00:23:08.690\nThe menus look a little different though,\ndon't they, right?\n\n451\n00:23:08.690 --> 00:23:11.850\nThat's because it's using a different\nversion of the desktop manager\n\n452\n00:23:11.850 --> 00:23:13.160\nthan what I'm using in Red Hat.\n\n453\n00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:15.352\nRed Hat's running NOM 2,\nthis is running NOM 3.\n\n454\n00:23:15.352 --> 00:23:18.490\nThese are changes that you'll see\nin the graphical user interface.\n\n455\n00:23:18.490 --> 00:23:21.402\nBut otherwise, I can get in here and\nI can launch a terminal and\n\n456\n00:23:21.402 --> 00:23:24.433\nit defaults to white background\ninstead of a black background.\n\n457\n00:23:24.433 --> 00:23:26.748\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But it's the same thing,\n\n458\n00:23:26.748 --> 00:23:31.580\nI can get in here and run commands just\nlike normal and everything works, right?\n\n459\n00:23:31.580 --> 00:23:35.995\nBut if I take a look at this,\nthis is Debian install that I did.\n\n460\n00:23:35.995 --> 00:23:41.127\nIt is running Linux DBN\n3.16 is its kernel, right?\n\n461\n00:23:41.127 --> 00:23:44.223\nSo 3.16 which is actually\na fairly old kernel,\n\n462\n00:23:44.223 --> 00:23:46.744\n4.1 is considered current right now.\n\n463\n00:23:46.744 --> 00:23:48.601\nIf I jump out of that,\n\n464\n00:23:48.601 --> 00:23:53.867\nlet me jump back over to my\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux system And\n\n465\n00:23:53.867 --> 00:23:59.042\nwe'll take a look at, whoops,\nthat's not what I wanted.\n\n466\n00:23:59.042 --> 00:24:03.830\n[LAUGH] See how much I can\nscrew up my commands here.\n\n467\n00:24:03.830 --> 00:24:05.540\nThere we are, that's what I wanted.\n\n468\n00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:10.300\nSo if we take a look at this one,\nI can see it's running 3.10, right?\n\n469\n00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:11.966\nSo it's even older.\n\n470\n00:24:11.966 --> 00:24:15.147\nSo I've got these older kernels, but\n\n471\n00:24:15.147 --> 00:24:19.980\nthen if I take a look at\nsomething like my actual laptop.\n\n472\n00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:23.390\nSo my laptop that I'm running on\nright now, I'm running Ubuntu.\n\n473\n00:24:23.390 --> 00:24:26.920\nAnd Ubuntu, they try and\nstay at that cutting edge.\n\n474\n00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:28.950\nThey offer a lot of interesting stuff.\n\n475\n00:24:28.950 --> 00:24:34.037\nAnd so when I take a look here at my\nown laptop, I'm running, oops, there,\n\n476\n00:24:34.037 --> 00:24:39.210\n4.10, right, a full generation\nhigher than what the other OSs are.\n\n477\n00:24:39.210 --> 00:24:42.880\nSo that's all stuff that we need to keep\nin mind when we choose a distribution is\n\n478\n00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:44.970\nhow close to the cutting\nedge we wanna stay.\n\n479\n00:24:44.970 --> 00:24:47.370\nOn a work station it's okay\nto crash every now and then.\n\n480\n00:24:47.370 --> 00:24:48.890\nOn a server it isn't.\n\n481\n00:24:48.890 --> 00:24:54.050\nSo in the business world we want those\nmore stable OSs, those things like\n\n482\n00:24:54.050 --> 00:24:58.200\nRed Hat and Debian where they're more\nstable versus things like Fedora and\n\n483\n00:24:58.200 --> 00:24:59.690\nUbuntu that are a little\nmore cutting edge.\n\n484\n00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:02.730\n&gt;&gt; All right, Don, so we've got an idea.\n\n485\n00:25:02.730 --> 00:25:05.940\nThere's a lot of choices to make\nwhen we go to pick our distribution.\n\n486\n00:25:05.940 --> 00:25:09.660\nWhat about applications that we\nwant to put on those distributions?\n\n487\n00:25:09.660 --> 00:25:12.342\n&gt;&gt; All right, so right now when\npeople write an application,\n\n488\n00:25:12.342 --> 00:25:13.850\nyou wanna get it installed.\n\n489\n00:25:13.850 --> 00:25:15.330\nBut with all these\ndifferent distributions,\n\n490\n00:25:15.330 --> 00:25:16.300\nit causes a lot of problems.\n\n491\n00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:19.070\nDifferent distributions store\nfiles different places and\n\n492\n00:25:19.070 --> 00:25:20.470\nit's hard for a developer.\n\n493\n00:25:20.470 --> 00:25:22.280\nSo developers are gonna write programs,\n\n494\n00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:25.660\nand they're generally only gonna\nsupport the bigger distros, right?\n\n495\n00:25:25.660 --> 00:25:28.940\nSo let me show you as an example here,\nI'm gonna go to Google's website.\n\n496\n00:25:28.940 --> 00:25:30.470\nAnd let's say I wanna download Chrome.\n\n497\n00:25:30.470 --> 00:25:33.280\nNow Google loves Linux more\nthan most companies do,\n\n498\n00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:36.890\nso they're obviously going to\nhave a Linux version of Chrome.\n\n499\n00:25:36.890 --> 00:25:39.623\nWell, we kind of know that\ncuz I'm running it right now.\n\n500\n00:25:39.623 --> 00:25:43.954\n[LAUGH] But if I go on here,\nI can download Chrome and\n\n501\n00:25:43.954 --> 00:25:48.390\nit even tells me right here\nthat I can download it for\n\n502\n00:25:48.390 --> 00:25:52.221\nDebian, Ubuntu, Fedora, and OpenSUSE.\n\n503\n00:25:52.221 --> 00:25:54.740\n&gt;&gt; Right,\nwe haven't talked about openSUSE at all.\n\n504\n00:25:54.740 --> 00:25:58.290\nOpenSUSE is a version of Linux's\npopular businesses in Europe, so\n\n505\n00:25:58.290 --> 00:26:00.930\nif you're European,\nyou've already probably heard of it.\n\n506\n00:26:00.930 --> 00:26:02.505\nIt is attached to Novell.\n\n507\n00:26:02.505 --> 00:26:06.190\nNovell, they used to make NetWare\nwhich is kinda dead now, but\n\n508\n00:26:06.190 --> 00:26:08.330\nthey do openSUSE now\nwhich is a great product.\n\n509\n00:26:08.330 --> 00:26:13.980\nIt is I believe forked from Debian,\nI believe is where it originates from.\n\n510\n00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:16.600\nIt's not a start out original one.\n\n511\n00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:17.690\nYou'll see other companies that do that,\n\n512\n00:26:17.690 --> 00:26:20.740\nlike Oracle Linux,\nwhich is forked from CentOS,\n\n513\n00:26:20.740 --> 00:26:25.040\nwhich in turn is forked from Red Hat, so\nyou get some of the branch out like that.\n\n514\n00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:30.045\nBut if I'm running Slackware, and\nI come here to download Chrome,\n\n515\n00:26:30.045 --> 00:26:33.390\nSlackware's not on that list,\nI'm gonna be in trouble.\n\n516\n00:26:33.390 --> 00:26:34.600\nHow do I install it, right?\n\n517\n00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:37.380\nSo that's gonna limit which\ndistribution we choose, too.\n\n518\n00:26:37.380 --> 00:26:38.460\nAnd when you go to download,\n\n519\n00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:44.770\nwhat you'll find out is that a number of\nproducts use different package installers.\n\n520\n00:26:44.770 --> 00:26:49.060\nAnd so when I go to download this, here's\nthe 64-bit version for Debian/Ubuntu, and\n\n521\n00:26:49.060 --> 00:26:52.450\nhere's the 64-bit version for\nFedora and openSUSE.\n\n522\n00:26:52.450 --> 00:26:54.500\nThat if they're built\noff of the same core,\n\n523\n00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:56.840\nthey'll use the same package manager.\n\n524\n00:26:56.840 --> 00:26:59.220\nNow openSUSE, I said I thought\nit was based off of Debian.\n\n525\n00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:01.690\nI guess it isn't if it uses RPMs.\n\n526\n00:27:01.690 --> 00:27:04.370\nRPM stands for\nthe Red Hat Package Manager.\n\n527\n00:27:04.370 --> 00:27:07.160\nAnd in the Red Hat world,\nthat's what you use to install programs.\n\n528\n00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:10.150\nFedora uses it, CentOS uses it.\n\n529\n00:27:10.150 --> 00:27:11.270\nOracle Linux uses it.\n\n530\n00:27:11.270 --> 00:27:14.020\nAnybody that's based off\nof Red Hat uses RPM.\n\n531\n00:27:14.020 --> 00:27:16.940\nAnybody based off of\nDebian uses .deb files.\n\n532\n00:27:16.940 --> 00:27:20.900\nSo Ubuntu, Linux Mint, they use these\n.deb files to get it installed.\n\n533\n00:27:20.900 --> 00:27:23.320\nSo if you pick a distro that\nis based on one of those,\n\n534\n00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:25.630\nyou'll likely be able to\ninstall this software.\n\n535\n00:27:25.630 --> 00:27:28.228\nBut if you pick a distro that's\noff on its own, that doesn't use\n\n536\n00:27:28.228 --> 00:27:31.470\none of these package managers,\nnow you've got a real problem, right?\n\n537\n00:27:31.470 --> 00:27:35.180\nSo when I download it, I need to make\nsure I download the appropriate one.\n\n538\n00:27:35.180 --> 00:27:37.670\nOtherwise it's not gonna work out so\nwell for me.\n\n539\n00:27:37.670 --> 00:27:41.435\nAnd what you'll find is that when\nyou go to install this software,\n\n540\n00:27:41.435 --> 00:27:45.400\nif you're in the Debian world,\nyou have a utility called apt, A-P-T.\n\n541\n00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:49.880\nAnd what apt does is it lets you\ninstall these Debian packages.\n\n542\n00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:52.100\nAnd in the Red Hat world,\nwe actually have several activities.\n\n543\n00:27:52.100 --> 00:27:54.367\nWe have RPM, the Red Hat Package Manager.\n\n544\n00:27:54.367 --> 00:27:59.633\nYou have YUM, the Yellow Dog Update\nManager which lets you apply the RPMs.\n\n545\n00:27:59.633 --> 00:28:03.501\nAnd then you also have DNF, which I\ncan't remember what DNF stands for, but\n\n546\n00:28:03.501 --> 00:28:06.403\ntheir newest cutting edge one\nthat's only in Fedora, so\n\n547\n00:28:06.403 --> 00:28:08.291\nyou don't have it in any others yet.\n\n548\n00:28:08.291 --> 00:28:11.900\nBut it lets you install the RPMs so\nyou're working with the same packages.\n\n549\n00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:14.240\n&gt;&gt; But that's important because\nwhen you go to download software,\n\n550\n00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:16.040\nyou need to get the right one for\nyour distro.\n\n551\n00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:19.132\nAnd if you've picked an obscure\ndistro that just has a cool name, or\n\n552\n00:28:19.132 --> 00:28:22.767\na neat wallpaper you like, you can end up\nin a situation where you're not able to\n\n553\n00:28:22.767 --> 00:28:24.360\nrun the software that you expect.\n\n554\n00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:25.224\n&gt;&gt; All right, Don,\n\n555\n00:28:25.224 --> 00:28:28.804\ngreat look there at all the different\ndistributions that are available.\n\n556\n00:28:28.804 --> 00:28:31.087\nI'm ready, I'm gonna have to\ngo buy some extra drives so\n\n557\n00:28:31.087 --> 00:28:34.720\nI can start downloading and creating\nvirtual machines and trying them all.\n\n558\n00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:36.090\nAll right, but anyway, thanks, Don, for\n\n559\n00:28:36.090 --> 00:28:38.600\nthat great information about the different\ndistributions we have available.\n\n560\n00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:41.100\nHope everybody out there\nenjoyed watching this one.\n\n561\n00:28:41.100 -->

00:00:06.580\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:08.208\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.208 --> 00:00:12.670\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:15.949\n&gt;&gt; Hello, welcome to another\nexciting episode here at ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:19.910\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick, and\ntoday we're doing Linux for Beginners.\n\n8\n00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.670\nIn this episode, we're gonna be\nlooking at choosing a desktop.\n\n9\n00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.382\nAnd here to guide us through this\nall-important decision is Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n10\n00:00:27.382 --> 00:00:28.175\nWelcome, Don.\n\n11\n00:00:28.175 --> 00:00:29.760\n&gt;&gt; Hey, thanks for having me back, Mike.\n\n12\n00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.549\nYeah, this is kind of a neat episode,\nbecause in the last episode we talked\n\n13\n00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:34.680\na little about picking your distribution,\nright?\n\n14\n00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.750\nWe talked about Red Hat,\nand Ubuntu, and Debian, and\n\n15\n00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.310\nall these different distributions\nthat are out there.\n\n16\n00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:45.990\nBut at the end of the day, for most users,\nfor most just regular Linux users,\n\n17\n00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:49.530\nthe distribution doesn't truly matter, as\nlong as you're getting security updates.\n\n18\n00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.010\nWhat really matters to you is\nwhat the desktop looks like.\n\n19\n00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.485\nAnd I know tons of people out there that\nchoose which Linux distro they wanna run\n\n20\n00:00:56.485 --> 00:00:57.603\nbecause of the desktop.\n\n21\n00:00:57.603 --> 00:01:03.380\nAnd they don't realize that the desktop\nyou use is independent of the distro.\n\n22\n00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:05.970\nYou can actually install\nthat desktop on any distro.\n\n23\n00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.940\nSo you can make Fedora look like Ubuntu,\nor you can make Ubuntu look like Debian.\n\n24\n00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:13.500\nIt's all kinda interchangeable.\n\n25\n00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.216\nSo I wanted to spend some\ntime in this episode, and\n\n26\n00:01:16.216 --> 00:01:20.176\ntalk about those desktops and what it\ntakes to pick the right one for you.\n\n27\n00:01:20.176 --> 00:01:22.560\nAnd kind of how they work and\nget a chance to see that.\n\n28\n00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.838\n&gt;&gt; All right, Don, so what makes up our\ndesktop environment in a Linux system?\n\n29\n00:01:26.838 --> 00:01:29.550\n&gt;&gt; There's a lot of confusion on this one,\nright?\n\n30\n00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:32.530\nWe use the term desktop environment or\njust desktop, right?\n\n31\n00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.632\nWhich is what we see when\nwe look at the screen.\n\n32\n00:01:35.632 --> 00:01:39.760\nBut there's actually a couple of different\npieces that go together to make up\n\n33\n00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:41.930\nwhat appears on your screen.\n\n34\n00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:47.092\nThe first thing is what we visually see\nas the user, we see windows, right?\n\n35\n00:01:47.092 --> 00:01:49.570\nNot Microsoft Windows,\nbut application windows.\n\n36\n00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:52.401\nEach application runs in a little box and\nwe see it on the screen.\n\n37\n00:01:52.401 --> 00:01:56.720\nAnd that is actually being powered\nby what is called a window manager.\n\n38\n00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.490\nAnd the window manager is what most\npeople think of as their desktop, but\n\n39\n00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:02.820\nit's really just one piece.\n\n40\n00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:03.415\nUnder the hood,\n\n41\n00:02:03.415 --> 00:02:08.260\nthere's an even more important piece that\nwe don't see called the display server.\n\n42\n00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:13.961\nAnd the display server is\nwhat's actually responsible for\n\n43\n00:02:13.961 --> 00:02:18.758\ngetting graphics to show\nup on your screen at all.\n\n44\n00:02:18.758 --> 00:02:22.486\nWhen you fire up true Linux, I'll call it\ntrue Linux, right, just the kernel, and\n\n45\n00:02:22.486 --> 00:02:24.970\nyou fire the basest of support,\nyou get a command line.\n\n46\n00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:29.710\nYou get a text based shell, and that's\nhow Linux was when it was first released.\n\n47\n00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:31.858\nThe whole graphics stuff got added on.\n\n48\n00:02:31.858 --> 00:02:33.630\nSo they added a display server, and\n\n49\n00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.500\nthe display server brought\nus into the graphical world.\n\n50\n00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.160\nBut the display server doesn't know\nabout applications and windows,\n\n51\n00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.230\nthe early display servers would just\nthrow an application up full screen.\n\n52\n00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:44.810\nYou'd run it, and\nit would run full screen.\n\n53\n00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.296\nSo with a window manager,\nit comes in and says, no,\n\n54\n00:02:47.296 --> 00:02:49.852\nthe application can actually\nrun in a smaller space.\n\n55\n00:02:49.852 --> 00:02:52.765\nAnd it'll be over here on this side of the\nscreen, or down here on this other side,\n\n56\n00:02:52.765 --> 00:02:54.160\nor whatever, you move around.\n\n57\n00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.590\nThat's what the window manager is doing.\n\n58\n00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.930\nThe display server is rendering it\nonscreen and managing the memory buffers.\n\n59\n00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.810\nThe window manager is basically\ncompartmentalizing these applications and\n\n60\n00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.230\nmaking it all useful.\n\n61\n00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.290\nSo that's really important stuff.\n\n62\n00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:12.040\nAnd it's true in the Windows world, in\nthe MacOS world, and in the Linux world.\n\n63\n00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.300\nAnd so\nwe need to understand those components.\n\n64\n00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:19.704\n&gt;&gt; So now, do we have to pick a display\nserver and pick a windows manager then?\n\n65\n00:03:19.704 --> 00:03:22.725\n&gt;&gt; If you search around on the Internet,\nyou would think the answer to that is yes.\n\n66\n00:03:22.725 --> 00:03:24.490\nYou'd think,\nI gotta pick a display server.\n\n67\n00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:27.980\nBut the reality is there's just one\ndisplay server that everybody runs and\n\n68\n00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:29.360\nthat's X.Org, right?\n\n69\n00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.740\nI've got their website pulled up here,\nthe X.Org Foundation.\n\n70\n00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:39.530\nOriginally this was built as\nthe first display server for Unix.\n\n71\n00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:43.510\nAnd back in the old days it\nwas called X11, all right?\n\n72\n00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:45.552\nAnd you had X11 and\nthese various releases.\n\n73\n00:03:45.552 --> 00:03:48.744\nThere was X11R4 or X11R5.\n\n74\n00:03:48.744 --> 00:03:51.325\nR5 ran for a long time,\nR6 ran for a long time.\n\n75\n00:03:51.325 --> 00:03:53.915\nNow we're up to X11R7, right?\n\n76\n00:03:53.915 --> 00:03:55.164\nAnd then they renamed it.\n\n77\n00:03:55.164 --> 00:03:57.983\nIt actually went through a couple\nof different names briefly before\n\n78\n00:03:57.983 --> 00:03:59.226\nsettling on X.Org, right?\n\n79\n00:03:59.226 --> 00:04:03.125\nSo this is more commonly\nknown as X Windows, right?\n\n80\n00:04:03.125 --> 00:04:06.285\nIn the original Unix versions,\nit was referred to as X Windows.\n\n81\n00:04:06.285 --> 00:04:09.601\nAnd the X Windows display server was\nresponsible for taking graphics and\n\n82\n00:04:09.601 --> 00:04:13.307\ndisplaying them on the screen, and making\nit where you could actually see that.\n\n83\n00:04:13.307 --> 00:04:17.535\nWhere we could have applications that were\nrunning separately and being rendered.\n\n84\n00:04:17.535 --> 00:04:22.380\nIt actually runs as a server,\nand when you view the screen,\n\n85\n00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:23.430\nyou're acting as the client.\n\n86\n00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.060\nNow, the server and the client on your\nown machine are right there together.\n\n87\n00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:32.963\nSo on my laptop, for example,\nI'm running the X.Org display server.\n\n88\n00:04:32.963 --> 00:04:37.400\nAnd I'm running an X Windows client\nto be able to connect to see it.\n\n89\n00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.954\nBut it's all part of my distro,\nand I just see the graphics and\n\n90\n00:04:39.954 --> 00:04:41.790\nthen what you guys see on my screen.\n\n91\n00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:47.440\nBut if you wanted to, you could\nhave X Windows, the display server,\n\n92\n00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.970\nrunning on one machine, and have\nX Windows as a client on another machine.\n\n93\n00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:54.880\nAnd so I could actually be viewing the\ngraphical applications that are running on\n\n94\n00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:58.330\na completely different system, and\nthat's really handy with headless servers.\n\n95\n00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.972\nI might have a server that doesn't\nhave a monitor or even a keyboard or\n\n96\n00:05:00.972 --> 00:05:01.852\nmouse attached to it.\n\n97\n00:05:01.852 --> 00:05:06.629\nBut I can fire up X Windows as a client\non my side and connect up to the display\n\n98\n00:05:06.629 --> 00:05:11.110\nserver on that actual server, and\nstart running the applications.\n\n99\n00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:12.412\nSo they look like they're running locally,\nbut\n\n100\n00:05:12.412 --> 00:05:13.563\nthey're actually running on the server.\n\n101\n00:05:13.563 --> 00:05:14.830\nIt's kind of a neat use for it.\n\n102\n00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:16.700\nNot very common, most of us don't do that.\n\n103\n00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:18.220\nBut that possibility is there.\n\n104\n00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:21.710\nWeb applications kind of killed that,\nwe don't really need it anymore.\n\n105\n00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:26.210\nBut for the most part, on your\nmachine you're gonna be running X.Org.\n\n106\n00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:28.763\nThere are a few others\nthat are worth mentioning.\n\n107\n00:05:28.763 --> 00:05:31.229\nWayland is one that's in\ndevelopment right now.\n\n108\n00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:33.827\nNow, you'll see a lot of\npeople talking about Wayland.\n\n109\n00:05:33.827 --> 00:05:36.168\nWayland is the display\nserver of the future.\n\n110\n00:05:36.168 --> 00:05:39.090\nX11 or X.Org is really old.\n\n111\n00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:41.960\nI mean, we're talking 30 years old,\nit's ancient.\n\n112\n00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:43.868\nAnd when it was originally designed,\n\n113\n00:05:43.868 --> 00:05:46.950\nthings like security weren't\nreally thought about.\n\n114\n00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:49.721\nSo remember how I mentioned there's\nthat client and server, well,\n\n115\n00:05:49.721 --> 00:05:53.070\nthere's absolutely no encryption\nbetween the client and server.\n\n116\n00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:54.880\nWell, if it's all on your machine,\nwhat do you care?\n\n117\n00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:57.840\nBut if it's over the network,\nthat's a real problem.\n\n118\n00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:01.490\nOr if somebody installed spyware on\nyour system, it could be intercepting\n\n119\n00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:04.372\nall of your display output because\nit's all being sent unencrypted.\n\n120\n00:06:04.372 --> 00:06:07.450\nSo there's no real security, there's a\ncouple other things that don't scale well.\n\n121\n00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:09.290\nX11 is just showing its age.\n\n122\n00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:12.910\nWayland is the future, I'll agree\nwith that, but it's not ready yet.\n\n123\n00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:15.630\nIf you run Wayland on your system,\nyou're gonna get some instability.\n\n124\n00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:17.030\nYou're gonna get some screen artifacts.\n\n125\n00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:18.930\nThe video drivers aren't complete.\n\n126\n00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:19.830\nIt's not perfect.\n\n127\n00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:21.348\nI'm not saying Wayland is bad.\n\n128\n00:06:21.348 --> 00:06:24.950\nI fully agree, Wayland is the future, and\nI can't wait for that to happen, right?\n\n129\n00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:27.633\nIt's actually really slick.\nIt's just not ready yet.\n\n130\n00:06:27.633 --> 00:06:30.980\nSo if you're learning and\nexperimenting, you can try out Wayland.\n\n131\n00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:35.311\nBut if you're working in a production\nenvironment, or if it's your daily laptop,\n\n132\n00:06:35.311 --> 00:06:37.460\nlike my laptop right here, I run X.Org.\n\n133\n00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:41.220\nSo most distros default to X.Org, and\n\n134\n00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:44.260\nthey give you the option\nto go Wayland if you want.\n\n135\n00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:44.790\n&gt;&gt; Gotcha.\n\n136\n00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:49.607\n&gt;&gt; There is one more I wanna mention\nthat I probably shouldn't, but Ubuntu.\n\n137\n00:06:49.607 --> 00:06:52.667\nCanonical, they decided they were gonna\ncreate their own window management that\n\n138\n00:06:52.667 --> 00:06:53.656\nwas gonna be even better.\n\n139\n00:06:53.656 --> 00:06:55.630\nOr I'm sorry, display server\nthat was gonna be even better.\n\n140\n00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:58.298\nAnd they created one called Mir, M-I-R,\n\n141\n00:06:58.298 --> 00:07:02.062\nlike the Russian satellite or\nwhatever, or a space station?\n\n142\n00:07:02.062 --> 00:07:02.671\nWell, whatever.\n\n143\n00:07:02.671 --> 00:07:05.472\nSo, they created [LAUGH] this\ndisplay server called Mir.\n\n144\n00:07:05.472 --> 00:07:10.373\nAnd Mir was designed to be able to handle\ndisplay serving on laptops, desktops,\n\n145\n00:07:10.373 --> 00:07:12.688\nservers, mobile phones, tablets.\n\n146\n00:07:12.688 --> 00:07:14.441\nIt was really supposed to be diverse, and\n\n147\n00:07:14.441 --> 00:07:17.361\nthey created a window manager called\nUnity to be able to handle that.\n\n148\n00:07:17.361 --> 00:07:19.430\nAnd it was the default in Ubuntu.\n\n149\n00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:21.560\nUbuntu is one of the most popular distros,\nso\n\n150\n00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:25.710\nyou might be thinking, hey, that's\nsomething I should really learn about.\n\n151\n00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:29.140\nMaybe three weeks ago,\nthey announced they're discontinuing that.\n\n152\n00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:32.720\nSo it was an experiment, and it ran for\na few years, they're discontinuing it.\n\n153\n00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:36.370\nSo if you're making a decision\nnow over what you wanna pick,\n\n154\n00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:39.200\nI would not recommend picking Unity and\nI wouldn't even mess with Mir.\n\n155\n00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:42.930\nMir was never actually in\na really usable state anyway.\n\n156\n00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:47.250\nSo those we kind of put out of our mind\nand we go back to saying we've got X.Org.\n\n157\n00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:48.506\nThat's really what we've got.\n\n158\n00:07:48.506 --> 00:07:51.932\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\nif there's really only one display server,\n\n159\n00:07:51.932 --> 00:07:55.852\nthen I'm assuming we do get to\nchoose our windows manager, maybe?\n\n160\n00:07:55.852 --> 00:07:57.379\nAbsolutely, yep, and on that one,\n\n161\n00:07:57.379 --> 00:07:59.662\nyou got a ton of window managers\nthat you can pick from.\n\n162\n00:07:59.662 --> 00:08:03.050\nAnd the window managers were really good\nabout creating versions that support\n\n163\n00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:06.950\nWayland as well as X.org, so\nthey're ready to make that switch too.\n\n164\n00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:09.840\nSo you can pick a window manager and\nsettle in on it.\n\n165\n00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:12.830\nAnd you don't necessarily care what the\ndisplay server is behind the scenes, or\n\n166\n00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:14.150\neven the distro, right?\n\n167\n00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:18.870\nIf I'm running Red Hat or Fedora or\nif I'm running Ubuntu or Debian.\n\n168\n00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:20.746\nIf I have the same window manager,\n\n169\n00:08:20.746 --> 00:08:24.770\nI'm gonna have the same type of user\nexperience across those platforms.\n\n170\n00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:27.890\nAnd that makes life really convenient and\neasy.\n\n171\n00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:31.397\nSo when most people's preference\nis simply how the desktop looks,\n\n172\n00:08:31.397 --> 00:08:35.065\nwhat they're really thinking about\nis choosing a window manager.\n\n173\n00:08:35.065 --> 00:08:39.900\nAnd there are a ton of very mature,\nstable, window managers available for\n\n174\n00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:42.599\nLinux, so you've got choices, right?\n\n175\n00:08:42.599 --> 00:08:46.753\nBut there's really just five or six that\nare truly popular that you see out there.\n\n176\n00:08:46.753 --> 00:08:51.607\nAnd it's gotten to the point where\na lot of distributions well,\n\n177\n00:08:51.607 --> 00:08:53.967\nany distro can support any window manager.\n\n178\n00:08:53.967 --> 00:08:56.852\nBut a lot of distributions have\nstarted shipping custom versions,\n\n179\n00:08:56.852 --> 00:08:59.167\nwhere they actually have one by default.\n\n180\n00:08:59.167 --> 00:09:04.702\nSo, for example, if we do like Ubuntu,\nlet me pull up the Ubuntu flavours page.\n\n181\n00:09:04.702 --> 00:09:08.638\nSo if you go and download Ubuntu today,\nwell, if you get Ubuntu 16,\n\n182\n00:09:08.638 --> 00:09:13.290\nit'll actually have that Unity window\nmanager I was talking about, right?\n\n183\n00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:16.860\nBut if you do Ubuntu 17,\nthey're moving back to GNOME,\n\n184\n00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:19.710\na different window manager that's\npretty standard out there.\n\n185\n00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:23.340\nBut they do various Ubuntu flavors.\n\n186\n00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:25.356\nYou can go to their website, and\n\n187\n00:09:25.356 --> 00:09:29.399\nyou can download these variations\nof the Ubuntu distribution.\n\n188\n00:09:29.399 --> 00:09:31.701\nAnd you'll see Kubuntu, Lubuntu,\n\n189\n00:09:31.701 --> 00:09:35.425\nwhich is I think they actually\ncall it Kubuntu and Lubuntu.\n\n190\n00:09:35.425 --> 00:09:41.700\nYou've got Ubuntu Budgie, Ubuntu GNOME,\nUbuntu MATE, and Xubuntu.\n\n191\n00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:44.880\nEach of these are Ubuntu.\n\n192\n00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:47.020\nIt's the Ubuntu that you're used to, but\n\n193\n00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:49.830\nit has a different window\nmanager by default.\n\n194\n00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:52.860\nEach one of these is\na popular window manager.\n\n195\n00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:54.950\nOther distros like Fedora,\nthey don't do that.\n\n196\n00:09:54.950 --> 00:09:57.960\nYou get one distro of Fedora,\nand once you're in it,\n\n197\n00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:00.670\nyou can choose which window\nmanager you wanna use, right?\n\n198\n00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:02.670\nBut Ubuntu, they try and make it easy.\n\n199\n00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:06.990\nSo hey, if you wanna use MATE,\njust download Ubuntu MATE.\n\n200\n00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:10.510\nAnd it defaults to that interface,\nand you get it and off you go.\n\n201\n00:10:10.510 --> 00:10:12.720\nBut it is all just Ubuntu.\n\n202\n00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:14.820\n&gt;&gt; Still the same OS under the hood.\n\n203\n00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:17.040\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, and so\nif you've learned something one way,\n\n204\n00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:19.510\nit's gonna work that way\nacross all of these guys.\n\n205\n00:10:19.510 --> 00:10:21.070\nNow, let's talk about each of these.\n\n206\n00:10:21.070 --> 00:10:24.480\nSome of these are more\npopular than others, right?\n\n207\n00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:28.200\nKubuntu uses KDE,\nthat's its Window Manager.\n\n208\n00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:31.030\nAnd the window manager in KDE\nis actually called Plasma but\n\n209\n00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:33.290\nmost people just refer to it as KDE.\n\n210\n00:10:33.290 --> 00:10:35.980\nIt's a really robust one, I'll show\nyou guys an example of it in a minute,\n\n211\n00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:37.831\nthat's known for\njust being very pretty, right?\n\n212\n00:10:37.831 --> 00:10:38.478\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n213\n00:10:38.478 --> 00:10:40.790\n&gt;&gt; It's pretty resource\nintensive in order to be pretty.\n\n214\n00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:43.242\nSo if you have a 3D video card,\nit'll take advantage of that,\n\n215\n00:10:43.242 --> 00:10:45.670\nit'll take a little extra memory and\nmake things looks nice.\n\n216\n00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:48.160\nIf you've got an older computer,\ndoesn't run so well.\n\n217\n00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:51.052\nBut if you got a nice new computer\nthen it runs really well,\n\n218\n00:10:51.052 --> 00:10:53.425\nit looks great,\nit has tons of functionality.\n\n219\n00:10:53.425 --> 00:10:55.936\nLubuntu is based off of LXDE.\n\n220\n00:10:55.936 --> 00:10:59.709\nLXDE is the opposite of KDE,\nit's very small, very thin,\n\n221\n00:10:59.709 --> 00:11:01.905\nnot a whole lot of flashy effects.\n\n222\n00:11:01.905 --> 00:11:05.455\nIt's designed to run fast, and\nif you've got old hardware,\n\n223\n00:11:05.455 --> 00:11:10.090\nit runs great, if you've got new hardware,\nit runs phenomenal, it's really good.\n\n224\n00:11:10.090 --> 00:11:12.050\nNow, LXDE isn't the first one to do that.\n\n225\n00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:16.110\nThere was one before that called Xfce that\nI liked, and you'll see that down here,\n\n226\n00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:16.640\nXubuntu.\n\n227\n00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:20.180\nThey run Xfce by default.\n\n228\n00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:23.615\nAnd Xfce is designed to be lightweight and\nrun fast.\n\n229\n00:11:23.615 --> 00:11:25.600\nThey've been around longer than LXDE.\n\n230\n00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:28.915\nLXDE gained a lot of popularity because\nthey jumped on the Raspberry Pi bandwagon\n\n231\n00:11:28.915 --> 00:11:30.050\nreally fast.\n\n232\n00:11:30.050 --> 00:11:32.495\nAnd so if you wanna use\na Raspberry Pi as a desktop,\n\n233\n00:11:32.495 --> 00:11:34.260\nLXDE is a great option for that.\n\n234\n00:11:35.265 --> 00:11:36.403\nXfce missed the boat on that one.\n\n235\n00:11:36.403 --> 00:11:37.285\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n236\n00:11:37.285 --> 00:11:39.968\nthen there's a couple of others\nthat are out there, GNOME and\n\n237\n00:11:39.968 --> 00:11:41.970\nMATE being two of the bigger ones.\n\n238\n00:11:41.970 --> 00:11:46.700\nEach one of these window managers has\ntheir own group that supports it.\n\n239\n00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:49.790\nSo, for example, here's the GNOME\nhomepage, if I go to Gnome.org.\n\n240\n00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:54.644\nThis is the GNOME window manager,\nirrespective of distro.\n\n241\n00:11:54.644 --> 00:11:58.170\nThis is not saying, this on RedHat,\nor Fedora, or even Linux, right?\n\n242\n00:11:58.170 --> 00:12:01.040\nBecause you can run GNOME on BSD.\n\n243\n00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:02.620\nYou can run GNOME on Windows.\n\n244\n00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:04.930\nThere's actually a version of\nGNOME you can run on Windows.\n\n245\n00:12:04.930 --> 00:12:08.400\nSo it doesn't care even what\noperating system you're running.\n\n246\n00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:10.300\nThis is the window manager and\n\n247\n00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:12.670\nthe desktop environment that\nyou're gonna be building up.\n\n248\n00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:14.653\nAnd it might be dependent on X Windows but\n\n249\n00:12:14.653 --> 00:12:17.930\nthere's versions of X Windows that\nrun on Windows and Mac OS also.\n\n250\n00:12:17.930 --> 00:12:23.640\nSo you really kind of break away from\nthe Linux bubble on this one, right?\n\n251\n00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:27.550\nSo let's run through each of these and\njust kinda get an idea of how they work,\n\n252\n00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:30.520\nwhat makes them tick, and\nwhat makes them attractive.\n\n253\n00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:33.340\nThe first one I wanna talk about is GNOME.\n\n254\n00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:37.300\nAnd unfortunately, GNOME is a little bit\ntricky because it is so popular, right?\n\n255\n00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:40.891\nA lot of distributions and\noperating systems use GNOME by default,\n\n256\n00:12:40.891 --> 00:12:42.970\nit's been around a long time.\n\n257\n00:12:42.970 --> 00:12:48.450\nAnd in the business world, GNOME is\nconsidered the standard Linux desktop.\n\n258\n00:12:48.450 --> 00:12:51.931\nNow the business world is where\nthis gets a little mucked up,\n\n259\n00:12:51.931 --> 00:12:53.784\nis that we had GNOME version 2.\n\n260\n00:12:53.784 --> 00:12:55.990\nGNOME version 2, wildy popular.\n\n261\n00:12:55.990 --> 00:12:57.780\nRed Hat defaulted to it.\n\n262\n00:12:57.780 --> 00:13:01.785\nEven on the BSD side,\nthings like Solaris defaulted to it.\n\n263\n00:13:01.785 --> 00:13:04.860\nDebian defaulted to it for a long time.\n\n264\n00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:08.470\nMany, many distros defaulted to\nGNOME version 2 as their default.\n\n265\n00:13:08.470 --> 00:13:11.950\nSo in the business world,\nthat's what people got used to, right?\n\n266\n00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:14.454\nWell, GNOME version 3 came out.\n\n267\n00:13:14.454 --> 00:13:18.170\nAnd when GNOME version 3 came out,\nthey changed stuff, right?\n\n268\n00:13:18.170 --> 00:13:20.224\nAnd if you're coming\nfrom the Windows world,\n\n269\n00:13:20.224 --> 00:13:22.173\nthink about like when\nWindows 8 came out and\n\n270\n00:13:22.173 --> 00:13:25.770\nthey changed to that stupid metro\ninterface, modern, whatever it was called.\n\n271\n00:13:25.770 --> 00:13:29.669\nSometimes they make bad decisions,\nsometimes they're good decisions, but\n\n272\n00:13:29.669 --> 00:13:31.730\npeople have to relearn.\n\n273\n00:13:31.730 --> 00:13:33.410\n&gt;&gt; Resistant to change.\n\n274\n00:13:33.410 --> 00:13:35.440\n&gt;&gt; People don't like to relearn, right?\n\n275\n00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:39.580\nSo when GNOME 3 came out,\nsome distros adopted it right away and\n\n276\n00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:41.100\nsaid, hey, we're gonna run GNOME 3.\n\n277\n00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:44.680\nOther distros said,\nI think we're gonna try something else.\n\n278\n00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:45.910\nLet's look elsewhere.\n\n279\n00:13:45.910 --> 00:13:49.070\nAnd so now we see where a lot of distros\nare defaulting to different things.\n\n280\n00:13:49.070 --> 00:13:51.720\nWell, not everybody gave up on GNOME.\n\n281\n00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:56.582\nSo there was one organization that said,\nyou know what, GNOME 3 is nice and all but\n\n282\n00:13:56.582 --> 00:14:01.375\nit looks so different that we're gonna\ntake GNOME 2 and we're gonna fork that and\n\n283\n00:14:01.375 --> 00:14:02.610\nchange it.\n\n284\n00:14:02.610 --> 00:14:07.200\nAnd so now, we have another\nwindows manager called MATE.\n\n285\n00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:10.830\nAnd what MATE is, if I go to\nthe MATE page here, what MATE is,\n\n286\n00:14:10.830 --> 00:14:15.720\nis really just a, says it right here\non the page, continuation of GNOME 2.\n\n287\n00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:18.340\nThey said, look, GNOME 2 wasn't broken.\n\n288\n00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:21.974\nLet's just keep it and update it and make\nit better, make it run fast and nice, and\n\n289\n00:14:21.974 --> 00:14:23.359\nso you can stick with GNOME 2.\n\n290\n00:14:23.359 --> 00:14:24.960\nThis gives businesses the choice.\n\n291\n00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:28.080\nThey can stay with GNOME 2 if they want or\n\n292\n00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:32.100\nthey can go on to GNOME 3 and\ngo that route, right?\n\n293\n00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:36.514\nMy own desktop here, if I well,\nif I'd minimize all this junk and\n\n294\n00:14:36.514 --> 00:14:40.308\nget down to my desktop,\nI'm running GNOME 3, right?\n\n295\n00:14:40.308 --> 00:14:42.920\nAnd GNOME 3 is characterized\nby a couple of things.\n\n296\n00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:46.030\nYou have this menu bar across the top,\nand by default,\n\n297\n00:14:46.030 --> 00:14:48.110\nit's showing things like the date and\ntime.\n\n298\n00:14:48.110 --> 00:14:52.388\nIt's got your little command buttons\nover here where I can jump in and\n\n299\n00:14:52.388 --> 00:14:57.648\nconnect to wireless networks, or log in\nand log out, power off the laptop, right?\n\n300\n00:14:57.648 --> 00:15:00.270\nThat's all controlled from\ncommand buttons up top.\n\n301\n00:15:00.270 --> 00:15:03.333\nBut the most important one is way\nover here on the left side is\n\n302\n00:15:03.333 --> 00:15:04.625\nthe Activities button.\n\n303\n00:15:04.625 --> 00:15:06.918\nAnd if I trigger that Activities button,\n\n304\n00:15:06.918 --> 00:15:09.680\nI get a number of different\nthings up on my screen.\n\n305\n00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:11.480\nLet me zoom back out here.\n\n306\n00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:14.780\nI get this little favorites\nbar on the left side,\n\n307\n00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:18.310\nwhere I can pin my favorite applications\nand so I can launch them quickly.\n\n308\n00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:19.890\nThese are the things\nthat I go into every day.\n\n309\n00:15:19.890 --> 00:15:23.303\nI go to my File Manager every day,\nI go to Chrome everyday.\n\n310\n00:15:23.303 --> 00:15:26.320\nVMware workstation,\nI fire that up every single day, right?\n\n311\n00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:28.790\nSo those are going to appear over here,\nyour favorites.\n\n312\n00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:32.510\nAlso, your most recently run things, so\nlike Chromium down here, I don't run every\n\n313\n00:15:32.510 --> 00:15:36.010\nday but I'm running it right now so\nit shows up down there in the list.\n\n314\n00:15:36.010 --> 00:15:38.070\nSo those are my favorites.\n\n315\n00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:41.594\nAnd then I've got this little,\nI don't know what you even call this,\n\n316\n00:15:41.594 --> 00:15:43.340\nthis little button square thing.\n\n317\n00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:47.770\nAnd if you click on that,\nit shows you all of your applications.\n\n318\n00:15:47.770 --> 00:15:50.835\nNow I get a list of all the applications\nthat are installed, well, actually,\n\n319\n00:15:50.835 --> 00:15:52.236\nI say all, this is still frequent.\n\n320\n00:15:52.236 --> 00:15:55.868\nAnd then if I go over here to All, now I\nsee all the applications I've installed\n\n321\n00:15:55.868 --> 00:15:58.523\nand you'll see that there's\nquite a bit there, right?\n\n322\n00:15:58.523 --> 00:16:03.550\nThis is a very touch screeny\ntype interface, right?\n\n323\n00:16:03.550 --> 00:16:07.120\nThis is what I would expect on a tablet or\na mobile phone, right?\n\n324\n00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:09.480\nAnd a lot of people didn't like that.\n\n325\n00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:11.240\nThat known 3 is different.\n\n326\n00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:15.770\nNow I like it, because I don't normally\nuse my mouse if I can avoid it, right?\n\n327\n00:16:15.770 --> 00:16:20.450\nIf I wanna run an application, I don't\nthink, man, I've got to click activities,\n\n328\n00:16:20.450 --> 00:16:22.680\nI've got to click this button thing,\nI've got to click on all,\n\n329\n00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:23.880\nI've got to find the application.\n\n330\n00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:24.830\nI don't think that way.\n\n331\n00:16:24.830 --> 00:16:28.450\nFor me,\nI press the super button on my keyboard.\n\n332\n00:16:28.450 --> 00:16:30.460\n&gt;&gt; Right, the super button.\n\n333\n00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:31.320\n&gt;&gt; The super button, yeah.\n\n334\n00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:34.030\nOn a US keyboard at least,\n\n335\n00:16:34.030 --> 00:16:37.490\nit's very common to have Windows keys,\nright, with the Microsoft Windows logo.\n\n336\n00:16:37.490 --> 00:16:39.900\nIn the Linux world,\nwe call that the super button, right?\n\n337\n00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:43.560\nAnd when you buy a laptop like mine,\nmy laptop actually came with Linux, and so\n\n338\n00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:46.970\nthey replaced it with the, actually\nmine has got the Ubuntu logo on it\n\n339\n00:16:46.970 --> 00:16:50.270\ninstead of the Windows key, so\nthey call it a super button.\n\n340\n00:16:50.270 --> 00:16:53.200\nBut when you push the super button, it's\nthe same thing as clicking activities, up\n\n341\n00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:57.490\nthere at the top, and if I just ignore all\nthe screen elements, I can start to type,\n\n342\n00:16:57.490 --> 00:17:04.080\nand maybe I want to run open shot, a video\neditor, so I can just type open shot.\n\n343\n00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:05.940\nAnd there it is, and I can press Enter.\n\n344\n00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:07.210\nSo I never even used the mouse.\n\n345\n00:17:07.210 --> 00:17:10.680\nI just hit the super key,\ntype the program I want, press Enter, and\n\n346\n00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:13.200\nnow it's gonna launch, and\nI'm in open shot, right?\n\n347\n00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:15.170\n&gt;&gt; And that wasn't in GNOME 2,\nthat was GNOME 3?\n\n348\n00:17:15.170 --> 00:17:16.560\n&gt;&gt; This is GNOME 3, yep.\n\n349\n00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:20.330\nGNOME 2 had a similar function but\nit was designed definitely more for\n\n350\n00:17:20.330 --> 00:17:21.430\nthe mouse side of things, right?\n\n351\n00:17:21.430 --> 00:17:22.607\nNavigable menus.\n\n352\n00:17:22.607 --> 00:17:24.520\nLet's take a look at that.\n\n353\n00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:26.835\nSo this is Gnome 3, right?\n\n354\n00:17:26.835 --> 00:17:33.870\nIn the background here, I've got that's\nactually a default that's Gnome 3 also.\n\n355\n00:17:33.870 --> 00:17:36.460\nSometimes it gets a little bit confusing.\n\n356\n00:17:36.460 --> 00:17:37.900\nI've got Ubuntu Matte.\n\n357\n00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:39.600\nMatte is that continuation of Gnome 2.\n\n358\n00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:42.920\nSo on this machine,\nif I get logged into it,\n\n359\n00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:48.580\nIt will look more like\nwhat Gnome two look like.\n\n360\n00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:52.770\nNow, in Gnome two, we had a menu bar,\nbut it was down here at the bottom.\n\n361\n00:17:52.770 --> 00:17:54.310\nYou can move it up to\nthe top if you wanted,\n\n362\n00:17:54.310 --> 00:17:57.370\nbut it was down here at the bottom,\nvery traditional like a Windows desktop.\n\n363\n00:17:57.370 --> 00:17:58.595\nLike a Microsoft Windows,\n\n364\n00:17:58.595 --> 00:18:01.850\nremember Microsoft Windows 95 was\npretty revolutionary at the time.\n\n365\n00:18:01.850 --> 00:18:04.696\nSo let's put this bar at the bottom,\nand give you a start button, and\n\n366\n00:18:04.696 --> 00:18:05.639\nall this crazy stuff.\n\n367\n00:18:05.639 --> 00:18:07.180\nIt is something you just got used to.\n\n368\n00:18:07.180 --> 00:18:09.280\nSo, even in the Unix world,\nwe'll see that.\n\n369\n00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:11.890\nAnd, I've got a menu button\nthat I can click, and\n\n370\n00:18:11.890 --> 00:18:14.500\nit brings up, well, look at that.\n\n371\n00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:16.170\nFavorite applications, right?\n\n372\n00:18:16.170 --> 00:18:20.560\nAnd, my folders that I can navigate\nthrough to come in and say, all right, I\n\n373\n00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:25.100\nwant graphics, and then here's my graphics\nprograms, and I can launch those programs.\n\n374\n00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:26.950\nSo, I'm navigating through a menu.\n\n375\n00:18:26.950 --> 00:18:31.370\nIt really is intended for\nmouse work, but you don't have to,\n\n376\n00:18:31.370 --> 00:18:35.810\nI could press the super button and\nI could start to type a program, and\n\n377\n00:18:35.810 --> 00:18:38.440\nI can press enter and\nit still functions that way, all right.\n\n378\n00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:42.190\nSo your muscle memory will be the same,\nbut most people didn't use it that way,\n\n379\n00:18:42.190 --> 00:18:45.170\nbecause it wasn't obvious that was\nthe way it was intended to be used.\n\n380\n00:18:45.170 --> 00:18:49.316\nVersus what we have now, where that\nis the way it's intended to be used,\n\n381\n00:18:49.316 --> 00:18:52.870\nthey anticipate you just hitting that\nsuperkey and typing in what you want,\n\n382\n00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:55.260\ninstead of trying to navigate\nyour way in and find things.\n\n383\n00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:57.540\nThat's a big difference,\npeople don't like change,\n\n384\n00:18:57.540 --> 00:18:59.790\nand that's why we have\na desktop like MATTE.\n\n385\n00:18:59.790 --> 00:19:05.170\nIf you've used a GNOME 2 desktop before,\nand you like it, then Matte is\n\n386\n00:19:05.170 --> 00:19:08.920\na good choice for you, because it is just\nGnome 2 that's continuing to be updated.\n\n387\n00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:12.350\nIf you go GNOME 3, it's still GNOME,\nbut it's very different.\n\n388\n00:19:12.350 --> 00:19:17.590\nAnd you can spend some time in GNOME,\nthere's a tool.\n\n389\n00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:19.250\nLet me get out of this one.\n\n390\n00:19:19.250 --> 00:19:22.500\nThere is a tool called\nthe Gnome tweak tool,\n\n391\n00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:24.430\nand it let's you tweak a lot of stuff.\n\n392\n00:19:24.430 --> 00:19:27.940\nLike you can move this menu bar back down\nto the bottom, and you can change stuff to\n\n393\n00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:32.240\nstart looking more Gnome 2ish, but you've\ngotta do it, right, so it's a lot of work.\n\n394\n00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:34.750\nIf you just go in Matte, you don't\nhave to worry about that, right, so\n\n395\n00:19:34.750 --> 00:19:38.030\nthat's certainly an option\nthat's available for people.\n\n396\n00:19:38.030 --> 00:19:42.310\nSo just remember that they're both\ntechnically GNOME under the hood,\n\n397\n00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:43.270\nif that's what you're used to.\n\n398\n00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:45.840\nAlright, some of the other ones, KDE.\n\n399\n00:19:47.030 --> 00:19:50.700\nIf you talk to a highschool kid running\nLinux, they're usually running KDE,\n\n400\n00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:52.460\nbecause it looks pretty,\nthat's what they want.\n\n401\n00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:53.158\nThey want it to look nice.\n\n402\n00:19:53.158 --> 00:19:55.885\nThis whole website's dedicated\nto creating themes and\n\n403\n00:19:55.885 --> 00:19:58.290\nstuff to make your interface look awesome.\n\n404\n00:19:58.290 --> 00:20:01.780\nYou know, people have the transparent\nshell prompts and all this crazy,\n\n405\n00:20:01.780 --> 00:20:03.560\nbecause it looks like a hacker type thing.\n\n406\n00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:05.990\n&gt;&gt; I wanna be cool, yeah.\n\n407\n00:20:05.990 --> 00:20:07.650\n&gt;&gt; I hate it.\n\n408\n00:20:07.650 --> 00:20:11.282\nBut I will say that KDE is probably one\nof the most powerful window managers,\n\n409\n00:20:11.282 --> 00:20:14.688\nnot so much because of how it handles\nwindows, because there's only so\n\n410\n00:20:14.688 --> 00:20:15.800\nmuch you can do there.\n\n411\n00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:21.661\nBut because they package so\nmany special custom applications with it.\n\n412\n00:20:21.661 --> 00:20:25.470\nKDE has its own web\nbrowser called Conquer.\n\n413\n00:20:25.470 --> 00:20:27.560\nIt's got its own text editor.\n\n414\n00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:28.570\nIt's got its own file manager.\n\n415\n00:20:28.570 --> 00:20:30.800\nAll the stuff is being custom-build.\n\n416\n00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:33.340\nAnd it shows that's where\ntheir attention is,\n\n417\n00:20:33.340 --> 00:20:36.780\nto make these things look\nas sharp as possible.\n\n418\n00:20:36.780 --> 00:20:39.370\nSo, if I go back to my\nvirtual machines here,\n\n419\n00:20:39.370 --> 00:20:42.550\nlet me fire up a machine running KDE.\n\n420\n00:20:42.550 --> 00:20:45.590\nSo, here is a machine running KDE,\nI am just going to get logged into it.\n\n421\n00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:49.630\nYou will notice that even the login\nscreen is really different on this one.\n\n422\n00:20:49.630 --> 00:20:53.520\nAnd then when I log in,\nwell similar to Gnome,\n\n423\n00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:55.210\nI've got a menu bar down on the bottom.\n\n424\n00:20:55.210 --> 00:20:56.380\nAnd my head's covering up some of it.\n\n425\n00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:58.670\nYou'll see most of the control\nitems are down here at the bottom.\n\n426\n00:20:58.670 --> 00:21:01.500\nI've got my clock and\nmy other little items,\n\n427\n00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:05.690\nthat are all part of what\nmakes up KDE down here.\n\n428\n00:21:05.690 --> 00:21:08.490\nAnd so we can customize all that.\n\n429\n00:21:08.490 --> 00:21:13.130\nIf I bring up my menu, here's my menu and\nit's got category tabs down here at\n\n430\n00:21:13.130 --> 00:21:16.030\nthe bottom, so i can say i want\nto browse my applications, and\n\n431\n00:21:16.030 --> 00:21:18.370\nhere they are by category,\ni can choose computer.\n\n432\n00:21:18.370 --> 00:21:22.840\nAnd now i can run commands or browse the\nfile system, i can pull up my history of\n\n433\n00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:27.260\nwhat i've done and i can go o my favorites\nwhere i pin things that i run frequently,\n\n434\n00:21:27.260 --> 00:21:29.610\nand we start to execute these.\n\n435\n00:21:29.610 --> 00:21:31.960\nEverything in KDE is customizable.\n\n436\n00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:35.360\nI can change the menu bars\nto be 3D accelerated.\n\n437\n00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:38.100\nI've got 3D acceleration\nturned off in this machine.\n\n438\n00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:40.090\nYou can tweak a ton of different things.\n\n439\n00:21:40.090 --> 00:21:43.660\nThe little icons that show up can\nall be customized, is a very very\n\n440\n00:21:43.660 --> 00:21:46.675\npowerful interface for people want\nto make their computer look awesome.\n\n441\n00:21:46.675 --> 00:21:48.610\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm\n&gt;&gt; And then people who want to have\n\n442\n00:21:48.610 --> 00:21:54.580\na canned suite of applications\nthat are basically fully featured,\n\n443\n00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:57.840\nif you want to have full productivity and\nso on.\n\n444\n00:21:57.840 --> 00:21:59.620\nIt's got it's own Instant Messenger.\n\n445\n00:21:59.620 --> 00:22:00.490\nIt's own web browser.\n\n446\n00:22:00.490 --> 00:22:04.840\nAll these different things that are all\njust built right in to the Window Manager.\n\n447\n00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:08.700\nAnd you may not care about that stuff, and\nso it may not be the right choice for you.\n\n448\n00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:12.680\nBut if you want to look slick and you've\ngot a good hardware, KDE is a good choice.\n\n449\n00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:14.070\n&gt;&gt; Very cool.\n\n450\n00:22:14.070 --> 00:22:15.744\n&gt;&gt; All right, we'll see,\nwho else do we have?\n\n451\n00:22:15.744 --> 00:22:17.890\nWe have the lightweight guys.\n\n452\n00:22:17.890 --> 00:22:20.389\nNow prior to this laptop that [LAUGH].\n\n453\n00:22:20.389 --> 00:22:22.414\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm running Unbuntu on this laptop, and\n\n454\n00:22:22.414 --> 00:22:23.600\nI am running Gnome three, right?\n\n455\n00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:25.591\nThat's what I'm running on\nmy own machine right now,\n\n456\n00:22:25.591 --> 00:22:28.320\ncuz I'm forcing myself,\nit's always good to learn other things.\n\n457\n00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:31.170\nSo I'm not the biggest fan of Ubuntu,\nbut I'm using it because it is so\n\n458\n00:22:31.170 --> 00:22:32.710\npopular right now.\n\n459\n00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:38.530\nBut prior to this, I almost always run\nFedora with Xfce as my window manager.\n\n460\n00:22:38.530 --> 00:22:41.270\nI love Xfce cuz it's lightweight.\n\n461\n00:22:41.270 --> 00:22:45.600\nNow, I'll have an i7 with 32 gigs of RAM,\nI'll have a fast, high end computer, and\n\n462\n00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:49.140\nI still run Xfce because I don't\ncare about the window dressing.\n\n463\n00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:53.030\nIf I run a program, I just want it to be\non screen as fast as possible, it doesn't\n\n464\n00:22:53.030 --> 00:22:55.440\nneed to look pretty while it does it\n&gt;&gt; You don't want it\n\n465\n00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:58.630\nto catch fire when you close it [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Some of them really crank up the video\n\n466\n00:22:58.630 --> 00:23:02.140\nadaptors to render things, you hear\nthe fans running on your laptop and stuff,\n\n467\n00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:04.340\nthat's not Not what, I'm all about.\n\n468\n00:23:04.340 --> 00:23:08.390\nSo what you'll notice when you\nstart getting into some of these,\n\n469\n00:23:08.390 --> 00:23:10.170\nis that they're extremely lightweight.\n\n470\n00:23:10.170 --> 00:23:13.458\nHere's XFCE, right,\nI've got a menu bar at the top,\n\n471\n00:23:13.458 --> 00:23:18.267\nvery similar to Gnome, and when I bring\ndown my menu, it's very sparse right.\n\n472\n00:23:18.267 --> 00:23:18.846\n&gt;&gt; Hm-mm.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n473\n00:23:18.846 --> 00:23:23.715\nI have a bunch of crazy tabs, I just have\nmy favorites and my categories over here.\n\n474\n00:23:23.715 --> 00:23:28.438\nIf I navigate into those, I'm seeing the\ndifferent programs that are tucked in each\n\n475\n00:23:28.438 --> 00:23:30.780\ncategory, and that’s really about it.\n\n476\n00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:33.480\nIt’s not incredibly flashy.\n\n477\n00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:37.490\nIt’s just here’s, oops,\nhere’s, here we go,\n\n478\n00:23:37.490 --> 00:23:40.710\nhere’s the menu and\nyou see your programs and that’s it.\n\n479\n00:23:40.710 --> 00:23:43.780\nIt’s not this really amazing\ngraphical experience.\n\n480\n00:23:43.780 --> 00:23:47.670\nBut it works very fast, and\nit takes a very small amount of memory.\n\n481\n00:23:47.670 --> 00:23:52.531\nThe XFCE window manager itself, it's\nonly a couple of megs in size, really,\n\n482\n00:23:52.531 --> 00:23:53.500\nreally small.\n\n483\n00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:57.056\nAnd that means it runs\ngreat on low end hardware,\n\n484\n00:23:57.056 --> 00:24:01.671\neven Raspberry Pis, but\nit runs amazing on high end hardware.\n\n485\n00:24:01.671 --> 00:24:06.021\nSo it is very flexible,\nit is missing a ton of bells and whistles.\n\n486\n00:24:06.021 --> 00:24:07.602\nWhen you drag and drop a window,\n\n487\n00:24:07.602 --> 00:24:10.070\nthe window will go transparent\nwhile you drag it.\n\n488\n00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:11.330\nYou don't see the contents.\n\n489\n00:24:11.330 --> 00:24:15.930\nOther window managers actually render that\nas it's dragging which takes up resources.\n\n490\n00:24:15.930 --> 00:24:18.380\nThere's no 3D elements to this.\n\n491\n00:24:18.380 --> 00:24:22.470\nI don't get texturing, and overlapping,\nand drop shadows, and And all the other\n\n492\n00:24:22.470 --> 00:24:25.850\ncrazy things you see in other\nWindow Managers, this one's simple, right?\n\n493\n00:24:25.850 --> 00:24:29.910\nSo, that's what XFC is designed for.\n\n494\n00:24:29.910 --> 00:24:32.300\nLXDE is kinda the same thing.\n\n495\n00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:38.170\nLXDE is designed to be simple,\nthat it is just lightweight.\n\n496\n00:24:38.170 --> 00:24:41.530\nIt is rendering wrong cuz I full\nscreened kind of weird on that, so\n\n497\n00:24:41.530 --> 00:24:42.250\nlet me try that again.\n\n498\n00:24:42.250 --> 00:24:45.007\nThere we go.\nSo LXD is, again, designed to be simple,\n\n499\n00:24:45.007 --> 00:24:49.886\nbut it follows the more traditional GNOME\ntype layout, where you've got the menu bar\n\n500\n00:24:49.886 --> 00:24:53.702\ndown at the bottom and you've got\nyour menu button, you can go in.\n\n501\n00:24:53.702 --> 00:24:57.000\nAnd this really looks straight\nout of Windows 95, right?\n\n502\n00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:00.660\nYou've got your old categories,\nyour applications are right under there.\n\n503\n00:25:00.660 --> 00:25:05.263\nIt's fully mouse driven there's no,\njust hit the super key and type thing.\n\n504\n00:25:05.263 --> 00:25:08.340\nYou'll see it's actually doing\na little files search up there.\n\n505\n00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:11.840\nIt does have multiple virtual desktops,\nwhich are kinda convenient.\n\n506\n00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:14.023\nAll the Window Management\nSupport Virtual Desktops,\n\n507\n00:25:14.023 --> 00:25:16.940\nsome of them just don't have it\nturned on by default, LXDE does.\n\n508\n00:25:16.940 --> 00:25:21.730\nSo I can come in and\nfire up an application on one desktop.\n\n509\n00:25:21.730 --> 00:25:25.550\nJump to another desktop and\nfire up another application there.\n\n510\n00:25:25.550 --> 00:25:30.070\nAnd by doing it this way,\nI can jump between desktops to get these\n\n511\n00:25:30.070 --> 00:25:33.480\ndifferent layouts and\nwhatever it is that I want to work with.\n\n512\n00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:35.680\nMost of the Window Managers support that,\n\n513\n00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:37.930\nyou just have to get in there and\nconfigure it.\n\n514\n00:25:37.930 --> 00:25:41.689\nFor example, in GNOME 3,\nlet me get back out of this.\n\n515\n00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:47.000\nIn Gnome 3, the virtual desktops\nare actually created dynamically.\n\n516\n00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:51.920\nSo if I get some of this\nstuff out of the way, there.\n\n517\n00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:54.050\nSo if I'm on my desktop,\nwhen I go up to that Activities button,\n\n518\n00:25:54.050 --> 00:25:56.250\nI showed you guys how you have\nyour favorites over here.\n\n519\n00:25:56.250 --> 00:25:59.670\nWhat I didn't point out was these\nlittle buttons over here on the side.\n\n520\n00:25:59.670 --> 00:26:03.690\nAnd it's showing my current desktop and\ngiving me the ability to create a new one.\n\n521\n00:26:03.690 --> 00:26:08.730\nI can take a window, like my Text Editor\nhere, this is Sublime text, I can take it,\n\n522\n00:26:08.730 --> 00:26:13.133\nand if I just right-click on it,\nI can choose to move to workspace down.\n\n523\n00:26:13.133 --> 00:26:18.056\nAnd now, what's happening is\nI've got my main workspace here,\n\n524\n00:26:18.056 --> 00:26:23.890\nwhere I'm running VMWare workstation and\nkind of navigating around.\n\n525\n00:26:23.890 --> 00:26:28.960\nAnd if I go up here, I can see Sublime\ntext is parked on this other desktop, and\n\n526\n00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:32.240\nit's created a third desktop for\nme ready to move applications down there.\n\n527\n00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:36.548\nAnd from the desktop I can just do\nthings like hitting Ctrl+Alt down,\n\n528\n00:26:36.548 --> 00:26:40.240\nto move to that next desktop,\nand Ctrl+Alt down again.\n\n529\n00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:44.720\nAnd I can move between those really\neasy and it's all done dynamically.\n\n530\n00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:47.120\nI didn't have to define these\nvirtual desktops ahead of time.\n\n531\n00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:50.040\nAnd that's a function of GNOME\n3 that's really convenient.\n\n532\n00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:54.190\nEach Window Manager brings bells and\nwhistles to it, that I like that.\n\n533\n00:26:54.190 --> 00:26:57.384\nThat are something that you may find\nthat you really like and you say, wow,\n\n534\n00:26:57.384 --> 00:26:58.920\nI want to stick with that.\n\n535\n00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:04.120\nSo for me no matter which distro I run\nit's nice to run the same Window Manager,\n\n536\n00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:07.180\nso that I have things like keyboard\nshortcuts that are the same across\n\n537\n00:27:07.180 --> 00:27:07.950\nthe different distros.\n\n538\n00:27:07.950 --> 00:27:09.850\nOr the way that I zoom in is the same.\n\n539\n00:27:09.850 --> 00:27:11.500\nThose are things that you want to like.\n\n540\n00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:15.660\nNow I've said,\nI really have used XFCE for a long time.\n\n541\n00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:20.310\nLately I've been forcing myself to use\nGNOME 3 because, GNOME 3 is very popular.\n\n542\n00:27:20.310 --> 00:27:24.287\nCanonical announced they were\nkilling off the unity interface,\n\n543\n00:27:24.287 --> 00:27:26.320\nthey're going back to GNOME 3.\n\n544\n00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:30.526\nAnd so, that's one of the most popular\ndistros that's gonna be using GNOME 3.\n\n545\n00:27:30.526 --> 00:27:34.017\nLinux Mint, another popular distro,\nthey're actually sticking with MATE.\n\n546\n00:27:34.017 --> 00:27:35.070\nThat's what they like.\n\n547\n00:27:35.070 --> 00:27:37.150\nOr their flavor of MATE\nis called cinnamon, but\n\n548\n00:27:37.150 --> 00:27:38.561\nit is kind of all tied together.\n\n549\n00:27:38.561 --> 00:27:42.050\nBut you'll see different distros\npick different desktops.\n\n550\n00:27:42.050 --> 00:27:44.590\nGNOME is probably one of\nthe best ones to start with.\n\n551\n00:27:44.590 --> 00:27:48.530\nThat's one that,\nit's gonna be around a long time,\n\n552\n00:27:48.530 --> 00:27:51.170\nit's very widely supported,\nyou'll run into it in business.\n\n553\n00:27:51.170 --> 00:27:53.640\nBut you might want to check out KDE and\n\n554\n00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:56.732\nsome of the others ones, because they've\ngot neat features that are pretty useful.\n\n555\n00:27:56.732 --> 00:27:58.060\n&gt;&gt; All right, Don,\n\n556\n00:27:58.060 --> 00:28:01.330\nfantastic look at how we would choose\na desktop in a Linux environment.\n\n557\n00:28:01.330 --> 00:28:03.390\nLooking at that display server,\n\n558\n00:28:03.390 --> 00:28:05.780\nwhich there's really one,\nwe don't have a lot of choice there.\n\n559\n00:28:05.780 --> 00:28:08.890\nBut when it comes to the Windows Manager\nwe've got a lot of choices.\n\n560\n00:28:08.890 --> 00:28:12.160\nAnd now we're educated so\nwe can make that choice even better.\n\n561\n00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:13.150\nWe thank you for that Don.\n\n562\n00:28:13.150 --> 00:28:15.410\nWe hope everyone out there\nenjoyed watching this one.\n\n563\n00:28:15.410 --> 00:28:18.550\nSigning off for ITPro TV,\nI've been your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n564\n00:28:18.550 --> 00:28:19.180\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n565\n00:28:19.180 --> 00:28:20.529\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n566\n00:28:20.529 --> 00:28:27.854\n[MUSIC]\n\n567\n00:28:27.854 --> 00:28:30.319\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

ITPRoTV.\n\n3\n00:00:11.373 --> 00:00:14.185\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and thank you for\nwatching ITPRoTV,\n\n4\n00:00:14.185 --> 00:00:16.600\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n5\n00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.421\nI'm you host Jack Memos,\nfor Linux for Beginners.\n\n6\n00:00:18.421 --> 00:00:21.540\nInstalling software is this episode.\n\n7\n00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:25.760\nAnd giving us all the information\nwe need is IT expert Don Pezet.\n\n8\n00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:26.770\nHey, Don.\nGood to see you again.\n\n9\n00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:27.550\nHow you feeling today?\n\n10\n00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:28.690\n&gt;&gt; I am feeling great, Zach.\n\n11\n00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:31.140\nReady to dive into installing\nsoftware inside of Linux.\n\n12\n00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.670\nAnd this is a pretty important show\nbecause, well, the Linux operating system,\n\n13\n00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:35.610\nit's free, right?\n\n14\n00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:36.640\nAnybody can go and download it.\n\n15\n00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.130\nIt doesn't cost you a dime.\n\n16\n00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.020\nYou install it, and you're up and running.\n\n17\n00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.333\nBut the base operating system only does so\nmuch.\n\n18\n00:00:43.333 --> 00:00:48.037\nAnd so you'll immediately start to\nrun into limitations like I need to\n\n19\n00:00:48.037 --> 00:00:49.870\nedit some documents.\n\n20\n00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:51.550\nWell, what software am I gonna use?\n\n21\n00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.510\nOr I wanna do a drawing.\n\n22\n00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:54.440\nWhat software am I gonna use?\n\n23\n00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:55.720\nI wanna browse the Internet.\n\n24\n00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.390\nAnd so typically,\nright after getting things installed,\n\n25\n00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.550\ngetting the operating system installed,\nwe then need to turn around and\n\n26\n00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.330\ninstall the software that we need\nto make ourselves productive.\n\n27\n00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.760\nSo that's what we're gonna take a look\nat right here in this episode is\n\n28\n00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.480\nhow to get that software installed and\nhow to work with it and manage it.\n\n29\n00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.810\nAnd really get the most out of\nthe Linux Operating System.\n\n30\n00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.425\n&gt;&gt; So then, the first question is where\ndo I get this software for this thing?\n\n31\n00:01:15.425 --> 00:01:16.470\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n32\n00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.770\nit's a great question\nbecause it used to be hard.\n\n33\n00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.880\nIt used to be really difficult\nthat when you got a Linux distro,\n\n34\n00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.490\nit came with a certain set of software,\nso that was easy.\n\n35\n00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.600\nBut if you wanted anything else,\nit was really difficult.\n\n36\n00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.730\nIn the early days you had to go and\n\n37\n00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:32.150\ndownload the source code for\nthe application and compile it yourself.\n\n38\n00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.510\nAnd it was a nightmare,\nit rarely worked right the first time.\n\n39\n00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:38.050\nAnd so it was really just very difficult.\n\n40\n00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:39.400\nNowadays though,\n\n41\n00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:45.030\nalmost every Linux distribution ships with\na software store, like a software app.\n\n42\n00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.700\nAnd I say store,\nit's almost entirely free.\n\n43\n00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.060\nMost of this is open source\nsoftware that doesn't cost a dime.\n\n44\n00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.820\nSo while it's presented as a storefront,\nyou're not paying for stuff,\n\n45\n00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:56.740\nyou just choose to download and\ninstall the apps.\n\n46\n00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.950\n&gt;&gt; So question, why would they do this?\n\n47\n00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.550\nWhy would they offer it for free?\n\n48\n00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:02.696\nThat's fantastic!\n&gt;&gt; A lot of this stuff is community\n\n49\n00:02:02.696 --> 00:02:05.340\ndriven, so somebody recognized a need.\n\n50\n00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.910\nHey, we need a graphics editor for Linux.\n\n51\n00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:11.260\nSo somebody else said hey,\nall right, well I'm in college, and\n\n52\n00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.670\nI need to do a project for my Master's\nthesis, or something like that.\n\n53\n00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:15.570\nAnd they start development of it.\n\n54\n00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.740\nAnd then, a couple of other people team\ntogether, and one person says, hey,\n\n55\n00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:22.230\nI really like your graphics software,\nbut I wish it had a filter that\n\n56\n00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.110\ncould turn photos black and\nwhite cuz I'm doing some vintage stuff.\n\n57\n00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:27.840\nSo they write the filter.\n\n58\n00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.162\nAnd it's not one person sits down and\nwrites the whole program,\n\n59\n00:02:30.162 --> 00:02:33.510\nit's usually hundreds or even thousands\nof people contributing just little bits.\n\n60\n00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.170\nAnd it all comes together to\ncreate a really powerful product.\n\n61\n00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.038\nAnd it's given away for free because\nit's not like a company made it.\n\n62\n00:02:39.038 --> 00:02:39.940\nIt's all these individuals.\n\n63\n00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.240\nNow, sometimes companies do make it.\n\n64\n00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.740\nCompanies make software and\nthey just choose to give away for free.\n\n65\n00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:47.099\nAnd it might be because it's promoting\nsome other product they have.\n\n66\n00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:49.884\nSo, for example, Google, right?\n\n67\n00:02:49.884 --> 00:02:52.127\nGoogle is a massive company, and\n\n68\n00:02:52.127 --> 00:02:56.305\nthey make billions of dollars\nthrough advertising revenue.\n\n69\n00:02:56.305 --> 00:02:57.685\nGoogle is an advertising company.\n\n70\n00:02:57.685 --> 00:02:58.995\nThat's how they make their money.\n\n71\n00:02:58.995 --> 00:03:02.835\nBut they make the Google Chrome web\nbrowser, which is open source, and\n\n72\n00:03:02.835 --> 00:03:04.135\nthey give it away for free.\n\n73\n00:03:04.135 --> 00:03:05.565\nAnybody can go and download Chrome.\n\n74\n00:03:05.565 --> 00:03:08.025\nYou can download the source code,\nmake your own web browser if you want.\n\n75\n00:03:08.025 --> 00:03:09.135\nIt's all free.\n\n76\n00:03:09.135 --> 00:03:13.370\nAnd Google knows, hey, if you use it,\nGoogle is the default search engine\n\n77\n00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.580\nin that browser, and it'll take you to\nGoogle, and you're seeing their name, and\n\n78\n00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:17.690\nit's good for business, right?\n\n79\n00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:18.430\nIt draws you to them.\n\n80\n00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.310\nSo that's another reason why\na lot of this software is free.\n\n81\n00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.611\nSo when we jump into an app\nstore to look at these things,\n\n82\n00:03:24.611 --> 00:03:28.423\nyou'll see that most of it has no\ncost associated with it at all.\n\n83\n00:03:28.423 --> 00:03:30.201\nIn the Linux world most things are free.\n\n84\n00:03:30.201 --> 00:03:31.001\nNot everything.\n\n85\n00:03:31.001 --> 00:03:33.640\nThere is pay software out there.\n\n86\n00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.690\nSo you may have to purchase something\nto install, but a lot of it is free.\n\n87\n00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.640\nSo let's say, for example, that I wanna\ninstall a graphics editor, right?\n\n88\n00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.970\nWell, the number one graphics editor\nthat's out there is Adobe Photoshop.\n\n89\n00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:45.530\nEverybody knows Adobe Photoshop.\n\n90\n00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:48.770\nWell, Adobe doesn't make a version for\nLinux.\n\n91\n00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:51.291\nBut fortunately,\nhundreds of people got together and\n\n92\n00:03:51.291 --> 00:03:54.104\nsaid we should really have\nsomething like Adobe Photoshop.\n\n93\n00:03:54.104 --> 00:03:56.921\nAnd so they created a program called GIMP,\n\n94\n00:03:56.921 --> 00:04:01.546\nwhich is the Genu Image Manipulation\nProgram or something like that.\n\n95\n00:04:01.546 --> 00:04:03.578\nAnd so, it's available and\nI can install it.\n\n96\n00:04:03.578 --> 00:04:06.703\nWell, if I'm on Fedora,\nor I'm on Ubuntu, or\n\n97\n00:04:06.703 --> 00:04:12.270\nanother operating system like that, they\nall ship with pretty much the same store.\n\n98\n00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:15.029\nBecause the app store is actually\npart of the GNOME desktop, and\n\n99\n00:04:15.029 --> 00:04:17.650\nthe GNOME desktop is a default\non a lot of different systems.\n\n100\n00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:22.100\nSo you can take a desktop, like mine,\nso this is a clean install of Ubuntu.\n\n101\n00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:24.020\nAnd I'm just gonna pull down my menu,\n\n102\n00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:26.970\nand in Fedora you actually\nhave a drop-down menu.\n\n103\n00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:29.440\nWell, I guess it depends on which\nversion of GNOME you're running, but\n\n104\n00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.190\nnormally you'll have a menu of some sort.\n\n105\n00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:34.740\nI'm gonna hit this activities one,\nand I'm just gonna type software.\n\n106\n00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.132\nThat software store is pretty\nubiquitous these days.\n\n107\n00:04:38.132 --> 00:04:42.920\nYou're gonna see the software program\non Fedora and Ubuntu and Mint and\n\n108\n00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:46.330\nDebian and all these other\ninstallations that are out there.\n\n109\n00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:50.220\nEven CentOS and Redhat have this\nsame basic store because, again,\n\n110\n00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:52.220\nit's part of the GNOME environment.\n\n111\n00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:57.130\nAnd when you launch it, it's gonna offer,\nI didn't plan this, but here's this big\n\n112\n00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:02.120\nadd for the Genu Image Manipulation\nProgram that I was just talking about.\n\n113\n00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:05.690\nIt's right there, but let's assume that\nit wasn't there for a moment, all right?\n\n114\n00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:07.392\nLet's pretend that we don't' see that.\n\n115\n00:05:07.392 --> 00:05:08.790\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's not there.\n\n116\n00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:09.590\n&gt;&gt; Nothing to see here.\n\n117\n00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:10.910\n&gt;&gt; Figment of your imagination.\n\n118\n00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:13.660\n&gt;&gt; That instead,\nright beneath it we see these categories.\n\n119\n00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:15.242\nI've got audio and video.\n\n120\n00:05:15.242 --> 00:05:16.420\nLet me zoom in a bit here.\n\n121\n00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:19.510\nAudio and video, games,\ncommunication, news, graphics and\n\n122\n00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:21.690\nphotography, productivity and add-ons.\n\n123\n00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:23.740\nSo I might go to graphics and photography.\n\n124\n00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:24.960\nAnd I go into that category, and\n\n125\n00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:28.710\nnow I start seeing tons of programs\nthat are available for me.\n\n126\n00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:31.170\nAnd some of these I may\nhave never heard of before.\n\n127\n00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:35.495\nI've never heard of AMI or\nAMIDE, whatever it is.\n\n128\n00:05:35.495 --> 00:05:37.220\nAnalysis tools for medical images.\n\n129\n00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:39.790\nWell, I don't work in the medical\nindustry so I don't care about that.\n\n130\n00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:41.282\nBut maybe you do, and\nit's really important.\n\n131\n00:05:41.282 --> 00:05:42.803\nNow, Blender I have heard of.\n\n132\n00:05:42.803 --> 00:05:46.550\nIt's a very popular 3D modeling software.\n\n133\n00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:49.410\nIt's right there,\nwe can click on it and install it.\n\n134\n00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:53.840\nBut I was looking for\nthat graphics program called GIMP.\n\n135\n00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:56.120\nWhich I’m not going to be able to\nzoom in here while it’s like that.\n\n136\n00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:57.130\nBut there we go.\n\n137\n00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:01.220\nSo, I can scroll around, and I can hunt\nin, and I can find it, and there it is.\n\n138\n00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:03.040\nNow, normally I wouldn’t\nnavigate this way.\n\n139\n00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:04.970\nNormally, if I knew exactly\nwhat I was looking for,\n\n140\n00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:07.860\nI would have just used the search\nback on the main page, right?\n\n141\n00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:10.300\nAnd then I would have found it.\nBut if you don't know,\n\n142\n00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:14.820\nif you're just saying,\nI need a word processor.\n\n143\n00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:15.640\nI don't know the name.\n\n144\n00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:16.850\nI don't know even know one exists.\n\n145\n00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:17.542\nI just need a word processor.\n\n146\n00:06:17.542 --> 00:06:21.750\nThen you'd want to browse around like\nthis and look at the different options.\n\n147\n00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:25.960\nAnd so I can take the GNU Image\nManipulation Program or GIMP,\n\n148\n00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:30.460\nI can click on it, and I get a screenshot\nthat shows me what it looks like.\n\n149\n00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:35.230\nI get a description down here\nof how it works or what it does.\n\n150\n00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:36.843\nI've got a link to their actual website.\n\n151\n00:06:36.843 --> 00:06:37.535\nAnd their website,\n\n152\n00:06:37.535 --> 00:06:39.865\nthey usually have a lot more\ninformation on how the software works.\n\n153\n00:06:39.865 --> 00:06:43.922\nAnd then down here I can see reviews\nthat other users have posted to find out\n\n154\n00:06:43.922 --> 00:06:45.500\nwhether or not this is good.\n\n155\n00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:48.730\nYou have to keep an eye out for\nthis because\n\n156\n00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:53.590\nthere's a good side to free open source\nsoftware, and there's a bad side.\n\n157\n00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:55.210\nThe good side is, it's free.\n\n158\n00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:56.140\nIt doesn't cost anything.\n\n159\n00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:56.850\n&gt;&gt; That's a good side.\n\n160\n00:06:56.850 --> 00:06:59.110\n&gt;&gt; And\ntons of people are contributing to it.\n\n161\n00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:03.130\nOn a negative side, some of these\nprojects are headed up by one person, or\n\n162\n00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:03.930\na small group.\n\n163\n00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:05.491\nAnd over time they might lose interest,\nand\n\n164\n00:07:05.491 --> 00:07:07.313\nthey just don't feel like\ndeveloping it any more.\n\n165\n00:07:07.313 --> 00:07:11.720\nAnd then the software starts to get old,\nand maybe it doesn't work right anymore.\n\n166\n00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:12.465\nAnd when that happens,\n\n167\n00:07:12.465 --> 00:07:14.374\nyou'll start to notice the reviews\nreally start to go down.\n\n168\n00:07:14.374 --> 00:07:18.271\nPeople start saying it won't\ninstall on Ubuntu 17.04, or\n\n169\n00:07:18.271 --> 00:07:22.270\nit won't install on Fedora 25,\nand this is my problem.\n\n170\n00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:23.140\nAnd it doesn't get fixed, right?\n\n171\n00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:26.405\nSo that's a good way to kind of measure\nwhether that software is good or not.\n\n172\n00:07:26.405 --> 00:07:29.380\nYou'll also get an idea of how\nmany people have installed it.\n\n173\n00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:33.650\nI can see over 1,200 have\nreviewed this software.\n\n174\n00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:35.560\nSo that's a pretty good number.\n\n175\n00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:37.350\nI know 1,200 people\ndoesn't sound like a lot.\n\n176\n00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:41.110\nBut that's 1,200 that took\ntime to write the review.\n\n177\n00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:42.328\nI've used this software,\nI never write reviews.\n\n178\n00:07:42.328 --> 00:07:45.656\nSo there's probably ten people\nthat don't write a review for\n\n179\n00:07:45.656 --> 00:07:47.197\nevery one person that does.\n\n180\n00:07:47.197 --> 00:07:48.079\nIt's probably even more than that.\n\n181\n00:07:48.079 --> 00:07:51.217\nSo it gives me an idea that this\nis a pretty popular program.\n\n182\n00:07:51.217 --> 00:07:53.680\nIf I come in here and\nthere's only one user doing a review,\n\n183\n00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:55.341\nthen it's not a very popular program,\n\n184\n00:07:55.341 --> 00:07:58.378\nand I might not want to use that one\ncuz it might not be around a long time.\n\n185\n00:07:58.378 --> 00:08:00.861\nBut if this is software that I want, and\n\n186\n00:08:00.861 --> 00:08:04.566\nI like it I can just click that\nInstall button right there.\n\n187\n00:08:04.566 --> 00:08:05.708\nAnd when I choose Install,\n\n188\n00:08:05.708 --> 00:08:08.640\nit's gonna automatically\ninstall it in the background.\n\n189\n00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:13.470\nNow most software does require you to\nbe an administrator to install it.\n\n190\n00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:16.900\nAnd so it's gonna prompt me for my\npassword, and I'll need to authenticate.\n\n191\n00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:19.735\nIf you're just a regular user, your\nnot allowed to install software and so\n\n192\n00:08:19.735 --> 00:08:20.641\nit'll stop you there.\n\n193\n00:08:20.641 --> 00:08:23.101\nSo if you're sharing your computer\nwith your kids or your coworkers and\n\n194\n00:08:23.101 --> 00:08:25.160\nthey are not administrators\nthey won't be able to do this.\n\n195\n00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:28.775\nBut if I install it now the software\nis available for everybody else on my\n\n196\n00:08:28.775 --> 00:08:32.766\ncomputer so if I have other accounts they\nwill be able to use it once it's done.\n\n197\n00:08:32.766 --> 00:08:37.047\nBut this installation couldn't be easier\nI click install it moves right along and\n\n198\n00:08:37.047 --> 00:08:37.853\nnow its done and\n\n199\n00:08:37.853 --> 00:08:41.592\nI've got the launch button right here\nwhere I can launch the software.\n\n200\n00:08:41.592 --> 00:08:43.776\nAnd here it comes,\nit's gonna launch up, and\n\n201\n00:08:43.776 --> 00:08:46.190\nI'll be able to start creating pictures,\nright?\n\n202\n00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:50.380\nDrawing, doing whatever it is that I want\nright here in this application that is\n\n203\n00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:55.300\nat near the same level of Adobe Photoshop\nall done right here in that free format.\n\n204\n00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:58.870\n&gt;&gt; Now, what if I want to install\nsoftware that's not in the repository?\n\n205\n00:08:58.870 --> 00:09:03.570\n&gt;&gt; Okay, that happens and actually, I'm\nglad you asked where that was cuz I didn't\n\n206\n00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:06.180\ncall a repository and\nI should have, right?\n\n207\n00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:08.270\nWhen I go into the software store,\n\n208\n00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:12.130\nwhat I'm looking at is what's\ncalled the curated repository.\n\n209\n00:09:12.130 --> 00:09:16.280\nThat means that somebody somewhere,\nin this case, the normal organization.\n\n210\n00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:19.410\nThey have created a list of software that\n\n211\n00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:22.525\nthey have at least lightly checked\nto make sure it's not illegal.\n\n212\n00:09:22.525 --> 00:09:23.700\n[LAUGH].\n\n213\n00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:25.883\nAnd, well cuz somebody could\ntake commercials software and\n\n214\n00:09:25.883 --> 00:09:26.580\nchuck it in there.\n\n215\n00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:27.560\nWe don't want that.\n\n216\n00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:29.900\nSo at least check that.\n\n217\n00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:32.650\nAnd then they put it right\nhere in that store so\n\n218\n00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:36.200\nthat we can go in and\ninstall it and use it, right.\n\n219\n00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:41.400\nWell there are plenty of software packages\nout there that aren't here in the store.\n\n220\n00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:44.040\nAnd in fact I gave an example\nof Google Chrome earlier.\n\n221\n00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:45.460\nIf I want that Chrome web browser.\n\n222\n00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:46.940\nWell when you install Ubuntu or\n\n223\n00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:50.600\nFedora, they almost all ship\nwith Firefox by default, right.\n\n224\n00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:52.290\nSo I've got Firefox.\n\n225\n00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:53.670\nBut I want Google Chrome.\n\n226\n00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:54.620\nThat's what I want.\n\n227\n00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:57.990\nSo I go into my apps store and\nlet me go back to the main page here,\n\n228\n00:09:57.990 --> 00:09:58.930\nthe apps store.\n\n229\n00:09:58.930 --> 00:10:01.300\nAnd I'll hit that search button up top.\n\n230\n00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:03.120\nAnd I'm gonna type Chrome.\n\n231\n00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:05.470\nAnd I'm gonna do a search for\nGoogle Chrome.\n\n232\n00:10:05.470 --> 00:10:09.850\nNow when I search, I may find it,\nI may not find it okay?\n\n233\n00:10:09.850 --> 00:10:13.950\nAnd in this case, it's just sitting here,\nso it's not finding it.\n\n234\n00:10:13.950 --> 00:10:15.590\nIt's not here in the store.\n\n235\n00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:19.690\nAll right,\nthe reason is that Google doesn't\n\n236\n00:10:19.690 --> 00:10:23.700\nallow that particular package to be\nredistributed through the stores.\n\n237\n00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:26.570\nSo if you want to get it you've\ngotta get it from Google.\n\n238\n00:10:26.570 --> 00:10:28.380\nIt's open source, Google gives it out.\n\n239\n00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:30.130\nThey just don't want it being\nredistributed through these app\n\n240\n00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:32.150\nstores unless they control the listing.\n\n241\n00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:34.120\nAnd in this scenario\nthey're not doing that.\n\n242\n00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:37.600\nSo I need to get that software but\nI can't get it from here.\n\n243\n00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:40.350\nWell, software doesn't have\nto come from the App Store.\n\n244\n00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:42.280\nWe're not in an Apple ecosystem.\n\n245\n00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:45.280\nWe're not on an iPhone where you have\nto get stuff from the App Store.\n\n246\n00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:47.930\nHere, we can just go wherever and get it.\n\n247\n00:10:47.930 --> 00:10:50.010\nSo if I know that Google\nhas a web browser and\n\n248\n00:10:50.010 --> 00:10:54.330\nI want to use it, I can fire up another\nweb browser, whichever one I have.\n\n249\n00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:56.190\nWe'll fire up Firefox here.\n\n250\n00:10:56.190 --> 00:11:01.777\nAnd I'm gonna browse to Google.com/chrome.\n\n251\n00:11:01.777 --> 00:11:04.191\nAnd that's gonna take me\nto the Chrome website.\n\n252\n00:11:04.191 --> 00:11:09.102\nAnd when I go to Google's website, here it\nlaunches the fancy little animation and\n\n253\n00:11:09.102 --> 00:11:12.530\nit gives me the option to\ndownload Google Chrome.\n\n254\n00:11:12.530 --> 00:11:15.810\nNow I'm not using an app store,\na software center or anything.\n\n255\n00:11:15.810 --> 00:11:18.770\nI'm just downloading it right from Google.\n\n256\n00:11:18.770 --> 00:11:19.650\nAnd when you do that,\n\n257\n00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:23.650\nthere's going to be a little bit\nof a question it's gonna ask us.\n\n258\n00:11:23.650 --> 00:11:27.330\nIn the Linux world when you\ndownload an application\n\n259\n00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:30.900\nthere's actually two different formats for\napplications to be delivered.\n\n260\n00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:34.660\nI guess in all fairness there's\nactually a ton of different formats but\n\n261\n00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:36.680\nthere's two primary formats.\n\n262\n00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:39.790\nAnd so Google is asking ymeou\nwhich format I want this in.\n\n263\n00:11:39.790 --> 00:11:43.710\nOne format is a file\nthat ends in .deb okay?\n\n264\n00:11:43.710 --> 00:11:45.153\nDB is short for Debian.\n\n265\n00:11:45.153 --> 00:11:48.840\nAnd this is a package format that was\ndesigned for the Debian operating system.\n\n266\n00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:52.040\nUbuntu and Linux Mint are based on Debian.\n\n267\n00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:55.104\nSo all three of those OS\nshare this one format.\n\n268\n00:11:55.104 --> 00:11:59.234\nBut in the Red Hat world,\nthey use a different format called RPM, or\n\n269\n00:11:59.234 --> 00:12:01.200\nRed Hat Package Manager.\n\n270\n00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:05.880\nAnd Red Hat, CentOS and\nFedora all use the RPM format.\n\n271\n00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:09.460\nSo when I go to download this\napplication from Google,\n\n272\n00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:11.180\nit's asking me which of\nthese formats I want.\n\n273\n00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:13.913\nDo I want it as a .deb or as a .rpm?\n\n274\n00:12:13.913 --> 00:12:16.600\nAnd I can pick the appropriate one.\n\n275\n00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:20.740\nNow, I'm on Ubuntu right now, so I want\nit as a .deb, and that's the default.\n\n276\n00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:23.210\nThey try and auto detect this but\nit doesn't always work.\n\n277\n00:12:23.210 --> 00:12:25.200\nSo you might need to choose\nthe appropriate one.\n\n278\n00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:27.750\nI'll stick with this one\nthough cuz it's what I want.\n\n279\n00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:29.730\nAnd I'll hit accept and install.\n\n280\n00:12:29.730 --> 00:12:32.810\nNow it's gonna download that file, and\n\n281\n00:12:32.810 --> 00:12:35.090\nif you notice up here what\nit's gonna do with it,\n\n282\n00:12:35.090 --> 00:12:38.630\nit's telling me hey we're gonna download\nit, and what are we gonna do with it?\n\n283\n00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:42.540\nSoftware install is the default, so\nit's going to install the software.\n\n284\n00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:43.770\nYou don't have to install it right now,\n\n285\n00:12:43.770 --> 00:12:47.420\nyou could choose to save it right to\nthe hard drive and then install it later.\n\n286\n00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:49.535\nThat's nice if you want to install\nit onto somebody else's computer.\n\n287\n00:12:49.535 --> 00:12:51.160\nIn fact, I'm gonna do that.\n\n288\n00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:53.880\nIt'll be one extra step, but\nI want you guys to see it.\n\n289\n00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:57.990\nI'm gonna choose to save it,\nand once it's saved,\n\n290\n00:12:57.990 --> 00:13:00.220\nit's gonna download it, and so\nit's downloading it right now.\n\n291\n00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:02.260\nIt's 57 megs so it doesn't take very long.\n\n292\n00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:06.030\nIn fact, I think it's already done,\nyep, there it is, already done.\n\n293\n00:13:06.030 --> 00:13:10.675\nSo there it is, it's downloaded that file,\nand all I have to do is open up that file.\n\n294\n00:13:10.675 --> 00:13:15.690\nI'm gonna double-click on it,\nand it takes me to the app store.\n\n295\n00:13:15.690 --> 00:13:18.900\nWell, wait a minute, I was just in the app\nstore and Google Chrome wasn’t there.\n\n296\n00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:19.750\nWell, it still isn’t.\n\n297\n00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:21.408\nIt’s still not in Chrome.\n\n298\n00:13:21.408 --> 00:13:26.800\nI mean in the app store, but when you run\nthis package file, the store handles it,\n\n299\n00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:30.270\nand that’s nice because you can see all\nyour installed software in one place.\n\n300\n00:13:30.270 --> 00:13:32.750\nThis just isn’t coming from\nthe standard repository.\n\n301\n00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:34.950\nIt’s coming from somewhere else.\n\n302\n00:13:34.950 --> 00:13:37.560\nAnd I can choose install and\nit's gonna run through and\n\n303\n00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:40.920\ninstall it just like we saw\nwith Gimp a few moments ago.\n\n304\n00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:45.980\nAnd when that's done I'll now have\nGoogle Chrome installed right on here.\n\n305\n00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:51.040\nAnd that would have worked under Red Hat\nand Fedora as well as here under Ubuntu or\n\n306\n00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:53.630\nDebian, that install process is the same.\n\n307\n00:13:53.630 --> 00:13:56.240\nIt makes it really easy to install those.\n\n308\n00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:59.098\nNow there is one more\nformat I want to mention,\n\n309\n00:13:59.098 --> 00:14:02.730\nnormally you're gonna find .deb and\n.rpm files.\n\n310\n00:14:02.730 --> 00:14:04.016\nRight?\nAnd those you can just\n\n311\n00:14:04.016 --> 00:14:07.792\ndouble-click on them it goes right into\nthe software installer and it's a breeze,\n\n312\n00:14:07.792 --> 00:14:10.715\nbut every now and\nthen you'll encounter software, let's see,\n\n313\n00:14:10.715 --> 00:14:12.488\ndid I leave Firefox in the background?\n\n314\n00:14:12.488 --> 00:14:16.268\nHere, so let me go into Firefox and\nI'm gonna pull up a company,\n\n315\n00:14:16.268 --> 00:14:18.373\nthey're called Max Interactive.\n\n316\n00:14:18.373 --> 00:14:23.465\nAnd they make a desktop that is basically\n\n317\n00:14:23.465 --> 00:14:27.370\na clone of the old SGI systems.\n\n318\n00:14:27.370 --> 00:14:30.600\nSGI were these graphical computers and\na lot of people really loved them.\n\n319\n00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:34.250\nAnd so they make the Mac's interactive\ndesktop which is kind of a clone of this\n\n320\n00:14:34.250 --> 00:14:35.960\nolder user interface.\n\n321\n00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:40.410\nAnd if you go and download it from them,\nwhen you download it\n\n322\n00:14:40.410 --> 00:14:44.360\nIt is not a .deb or a .RPM.\n\n323\n00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:47.070\nThey've chosen to distribute\nit a different way.\n\n324\n00:14:47.070 --> 00:14:53.930\nWhen I go to the downloads on here,\nif I pull up the right page, then the way\n\n325\n00:14:53.930 --> 00:14:59.160\nthey actually have it, if we, let me make\nthis a little bigger on the screen here.\n\n326\n00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:01.985\nSo here, I can see the download,\nthey actually don't have a download for\n\n327\n00:15:01.985 --> 00:15:03.880\nDebian right now, they just have Fedora.\n\n328\n00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:06.070\nBut, when I flow my mouse over it, man,\n\n329\n00:15:06.070 --> 00:15:08.100\nthat is really small at\nthe bottom of the screen there.\n\n330\n00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:11.830\nBut, you'll see where it's\nactually downloading a file.\n\n331\n00:15:11.830 --> 00:15:12.330\nHere we go.\n\n332\n00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:15.140\nNow we can see it.\n\n333\n00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:19.800\nMax-indiy-1.0.0-installer.sh.\n\n334\n00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:24.520\nHm, that's not .deb, that's not .rpm,\nthat's not .sh, what the heck is that?\n\n335\n00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:26.120\nIt's a shell script.\n\n336\n00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:29.730\nSometimes they'll give you a shell script\nand by doing a shell script, it can\n\n337\n00:15:29.730 --> 00:15:34.900\nperform more than one action and download\nthe software, install it, and so on.\n\n338\n00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:39.175\nThis shell script is only 2K in\nsize that's really really small.\n\n339\n00:15:39.175 --> 00:15:41.335\nThat means this is not the actual desktop.\n\n340\n00:15:41.335 --> 00:15:44.845\nThis is a script that's gonna run and\ndownload the desktop and\n\n341\n00:15:44.845 --> 00:15:47.285\nthen install it and\ndo some other activities.\n\n342\n00:15:47.285 --> 00:15:48.705\nNow this does work but\n\n343\n00:15:48.705 --> 00:15:53.242\nyou need to be really careful with these,\nbecause what's in the script?\n\n344\n00:15:53.242 --> 00:15:55.303\nIt could be doing all sorts of bad things,\nright?\n\n345\n00:15:55.303 --> 00:15:58.267\nWhen you run a script it could,\nformat your hard drive so,\n\n346\n00:15:58.267 --> 00:16:01.424\nwe need to make sure we only run\nscripts from trusted sources.\n\n347\n00:16:01.424 --> 00:16:04.511\nFrom people that we trust,\ncuz otherwise anything bad can happen.\n\n348\n00:16:04.511 --> 00:16:07.928\nWhen you use a .dev or\n.rpm, they're sandboxed.\n\n349\n00:16:07.928 --> 00:16:11.800\nThey're kind of restricted to where they\ncan put files and what they can update.\n\n350\n00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:13.020\nThose are safe.\n\n351\n00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:15.370\nBut a .sh, there's no limits on it.\n\n352\n00:16:15.370 --> 00:16:17.240\nSo this is far less common.\n\n353\n00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:19.330\nYou don't normally see this, but\nI wanted to show you guys so\n\n354\n00:16:19.330 --> 00:16:24.200\nyou are aware that, while it does work,\nyou can install software this way.\n\n355\n00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:27.320\nIt's certainly not the best idea,\nbecause of all the inherent dangers in it.\n\n356\n00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:29.350\n&gt;&gt; Now, Don, is there any\ngotchas we need to watch out for\n\n357\n00:16:29.350 --> 00:16:30.715\nwhen we're installing manually?\n\n358\n00:16:30.715 --> 00:16:35.400\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, when you install software through\nthe App Store, the nice part about it is\n\n359\n00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:39.060\nit guarantees that the software\ninstalls in the right spot.\n\n360\n00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:40.200\nIn the right place.\n\n361\n00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:41.440\nAnd when it's in the right place,\n\n362\n00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:43.310\neverything is going to work\nthe way that we expect it to.\n\n363\n00:16:43.310 --> 00:16:46.730\nAnd by work, I mean It's gonna do things,\nlet me close all this junk here.\n\n364\n00:16:46.730 --> 00:16:49.760\nIt's going to do things like\nmake sure we get menu items.\n\n365\n00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:52.960\nI installed the GIMP image editor.\n\n366\n00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:58.560\nSo when I go up here to my activities\nmenu, and I pull up my show applications.\n\n367\n00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:00.930\nIt's gonna pull up my list of\napplications and there it is.\n\n368\n00:17:00.930 --> 00:17:01.880\nThere's gimp.\n\n369\n00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:03.930\nIt's got an icon where\nit's supposed to be.\n\n370\n00:17:03.930 --> 00:17:08.460\nBut when you install software manually,\ndirectly from a developers website.\n\n371\n00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:11.620\nIt's possible they may not have\ndone everything correct for\n\n372\n00:17:11.620 --> 00:17:12.720\nthe OS that you're running.\n\n373\n00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:14.550\nAnd you might not have an icon here.\n\n374\n00:17:14.550 --> 00:17:19.030\nSo I know I installed GIMP, but\nI can't find it here on the screen and\n\n375\n00:17:19.030 --> 00:17:20.550\nI search and it's not showing up.\n\n376\n00:17:20.550 --> 00:17:23.110\nAnd that's because whoever developed it\nthey put the program in the right spot but\n\n377\n00:17:23.110 --> 00:17:26.670\nthen they didn't put the icon in the right\nspot or they didn't create the alias.\n\n378\n00:17:26.670 --> 00:17:28.800\nThose are problems that we can bump into.\n\n379\n00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:32.680\nThere's also something called dependencies\nthat an application is actually made up of\n\n380\n00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:36.470\na number different pieces,\nlike a library file and other things.\n\n381\n00:17:36.470 --> 00:17:39.635\nAnd when you install it from the App Store\nit makes sure we have all the dependencies\n\n382\n00:17:39.635 --> 00:17:40.660\nsquared away.\n\n383\n00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:44.380\nBut when you install directly from\na developers website, they might have old\n\n384\n00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:47.990\nlibraries in there, or they may have newer\nlibraries than what your OS supports.\n\n385\n00:17:47.990 --> 00:17:50.380\nAnd all of a sudden you go\nto run your application and\n\n386\n00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:53.830\nmaybe the new application runs fine but\nyour older applications are now broken.\n\n387\n00:17:53.830 --> 00:17:55.320\nThose are problems there, too.\n\n388\n00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:58.080\nSo, stick with the App Store\nwhenever you can.\n\n389\n00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:01.980\nIf you can get the application\nthrough the software app,\n\n390\n00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:03.680\nthat's the best way to do it.\n\n391\n00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:06.730\nBut, if it's not in the software app,\nyou've got to go to the other vendors,\n\n392\n00:18:06.730 --> 00:18:08.840\nyou've just got to keep an eye on it,\nmake sure that it's safe.\n\n393\n00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:11.370\nIf it's from somebody like Google,\n\n394\n00:18:11.370 --> 00:18:14.340\nthey're doing the work to make sure\neverything is gonna show up properly.\n\n395\n00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:18.500\nBut if it's from some one off developer\nthat you've never heard of before,\n\n396\n00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:22.740\nthere's no real guarantee that it's\ngonna work the way you expected to it.\n\n397\n00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:24.760\n&gt;&gt; So how do I update the software?\n\n398\n00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:26.430\nDoes that happen automatically?\n\n399\n00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:27.260\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n400\n00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:28.380\nSo we install software.\n\n401\n00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:29.380\nThat's just step one.\n\n402\n00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:30.740\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Software gets out of date.\n\n403\n00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:32.650\nThere's bugs, there's problems.\n\n404\n00:18:32.650 --> 00:18:36.120\nIn the open source community there's\nalways new features being added to things.\n\n405\n00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:37.160\nWe wanna make sure we have that.\n\n406\n00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:39.640\nOn the security side we absolutely\nneed to make sure we have all our\n\n407\n00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:40.910\nsecurity updates.\n\n408\n00:18:40.910 --> 00:18:44.980\nBut on just the regular functionality\nside, we wanna make sure we get those.\n\n409\n00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:48.650\nIf you're installing through the software\napp, it does the updates for you.\n\n410\n00:18:48.650 --> 00:18:49.710\nThey're automatic.\n\n411\n00:18:49.710 --> 00:18:52.060\nSo when I go back out to my software app.\n\n412\n00:18:53.310 --> 00:18:55.470\nAnd I go here where my software\napp's installing Chrome.\n\n413\n00:18:55.470 --> 00:18:56.980\nBut if I go back up to the main screen for\n\n414\n00:18:56.980 --> 00:19:00.750\nit, I can see up here at\nthe top that it says.\n\n415\n00:19:01.930 --> 00:19:04.650\nAll is where I'm at right now,\nI'm viewing all software.\n\n416\n00:19:04.650 --> 00:19:06.920\nBut I give you software that's installed.\n\n417\n00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:09.790\nAnd it's got a little one by it, letting\nme know that I've installed something new.\n\n418\n00:19:09.790 --> 00:19:11.390\nAnd so I can go and\nsee what I've installed new.\n\n419\n00:19:11.390 --> 00:19:12.967\nBut I've also got Updates.\n\n420\n00:19:12.967 --> 00:19:16.530\nAny software I've installed\nthrough the software app\n\n421\n00:19:16.530 --> 00:19:18.650\nwill update through the software app.\n\n422\n00:19:18.650 --> 00:19:21.788\nAnd so I can click on that and\nI can see I have a program right now.\n\n423\n00:19:21.788 --> 00:19:23.560\nMine is actually the operating system.\n\n424\n00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:25.870\nI have OS updates that\nare pending right now.\n\n425\n00:19:25.870 --> 00:19:29.460\nSo I've got this update screen and\nthat`s where we`ll normally go.\n\n426\n00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:31.820\nAnd a lot of distros will\nautomatically update so\n\n427\n00:19:31.820 --> 00:19:32.790\nwe don't even have to worry about that.\n\n428\n00:19:32.790 --> 00:19:34.330\nIt'll just happen on its own, but\n\n429\n00:19:34.330 --> 00:19:37.180\nI can come in here and\nmanually tell it to do an update.\n\n430\n00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:39.420\nAnd now I'll get those new features.\n\n431\n00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:44.140\nNow this update screen is not the only\nupdate screen that you'll encounter.\n\n432\n00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:46.680\nFor example when you\nbring down your menu and\n\n433\n00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:50.880\ntype software, you'll see\nthe software update app right there.\n\n434\n00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:55.020\nBut there's also this software updater and\nsoftware and updates.\n\n435\n00:19:55.020 --> 00:19:58.690\nThat really sounds like three\nprograms that do the same thing.\n\n436\n00:19:58.690 --> 00:20:04.595\nAnd what's going on is that the software\napp is where we go to get software.\n\n437\n00:20:04.595 --> 00:20:07.935\nAnd when it does updates in the background\nit's calling the software updater.\n\n438\n00:20:07.935 --> 00:20:08.705\nWe just don't see it.\n\n439\n00:20:08.705 --> 00:20:09.575\nIt's in the background.\n\n440\n00:20:09.575 --> 00:20:13.810\nBut you can run it directly, and when I\nrun that software updater It's gonna run\n\n441\n00:20:13.810 --> 00:20:17.480\nthis separate program that's actually\nscanning the apps that I've installed with\n\n442\n00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:21.650\nthe software app, looking for updates and\nthen it's going to install them.\n\n443\n00:20:21.650 --> 00:20:26.390\nNow, you can only run one update\nprogram [COUGH] at a time,\n\n444\n00:20:26.390 --> 00:20:28.620\ncuz they lock the update database.\n\n445\n00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:30.460\nAnd so see how mine it says, Waiting.\n\n446\n00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:33.090\nWell, my problem is Chrome is\ninstalling in the background and so\n\n447\n00:20:33.090 --> 00:20:35.570\nit's locked the update database and\nso, I have to wait for that to finish.\n\n448\n00:20:35.570 --> 00:20:36.600\nI'm not going to wait.\n\n449\n00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:39.080\nBut it will normally scan across here and\nit will say,\n\n450\n00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:40.040\nDo you want to apply the updates?\n\n451\n00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:40.970\nAnd you say yes or no.\n\n452\n00:20:40.970 --> 00:20:42.270\nAnd it applies the updates.\n\n453\n00:20:42.270 --> 00:20:45.860\nThat's no different than coming\nin here to the main app and\n\n454\n00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:47.410\nchoosing install right here.\n\n455\n00:20:47.410 --> 00:20:50.610\nBut then the other software\none that I saw, or\n\n456\n00:20:50.610 --> 00:20:52.830\nif I just type the word update\nI'll get them that way too.\n\n457\n00:20:52.830 --> 00:20:56.300\nThe other one is usually the one that's\nbuilt into your operating system,\n\n458\n00:20:56.300 --> 00:20:58.070\nUbuntu has its own update system.\n\n459\n00:20:58.070 --> 00:21:00.560\nFedora has its own update system.\n\n460\n00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:02.840\nAnd so that'll update the OS and\n\n461\n00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:06.550\neven some utilities that we've\ninstalled not through the software app.\n\n462\n00:21:06.550 --> 00:21:09.490\nSo these are all different\nways to do the updates.\n\n463\n00:21:09.490 --> 00:21:11.880\nBut for most of us with\nthe normal software we deal with,\n\n464\n00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:15.910\nwe wanna do the updates right\nhere through the software app.\n\n465\n00:21:15.910 --> 00:21:20.130\n&gt;&gt; So, now that I have the software\nbecause I'm a fickle minded individual,\n\n466\n00:21:20.130 --> 00:21:22.269\nwhat if I don't want the software anymore,\nwhat do I do?\n\n467\n00:21:22.269 --> 00:21:24.260\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That happens.\n\n468\n00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:26.455\nYou might just need software for\na little while.\n\n469\n00:21:26.455 --> 00:21:27.640\nI`m going to edit an image.\n\n470\n00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:29.370\nBut that`s not something I normally do.\n\n471\n00:21:29.370 --> 00:21:31.490\nSo the GIMP software is\nactually kind of big.\n\n472\n00:21:31.490 --> 00:21:35.510\nIt takes up a couple of hundred megabytes\non the hard drive and if I've got a small\n\n473\n00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:38.985\nSSD or something, I don`t want to waste\nthat space, so I want to reclaim it.\n\n474\n00:21:38.985 --> 00:21:40.710\nI'm done with the software,\nI can just delete it.\n\n475\n00:21:40.710 --> 00:21:42.600\nAnd then I can add it back later on.\n\n476\n00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:45.990\nWell, unfortunately,\ndeleting an application is pretty hard.\n\n477\n00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:48.320\nBecause when it installs,\nit puts files all over the place.\n\n478\n00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:52.366\nThere's a configurations in one folder,\nand libraries in another folder, and\n\n479\n00:21:52.366 --> 00:21:54.700\nbinaries in yet another folder, and links.\n\n480\n00:21:54.700 --> 00:21:56.650\nMy goodness,\nthese links are all over the place.\n\n481\n00:21:56.650 --> 00:22:00.250\nWell, fortunately the software app\ncan handle the uninstall as well.\n\n482\n00:22:00.250 --> 00:22:05.660\nInside of the software app If you\ngo to the Installed tab up top,\n\n483\n00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:08.150\nyou'll see all the applications\nyou've installed.\n\n484\n00:22:08.150 --> 00:22:11.360\nAnd there might be a ton of\nthings in here even if you've\n\n485\n00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:14.700\nnever launched the software app before and\nthat's because there's\n\n486\n00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:17.880\ndefault applications that are installed\nas part of your operating system.\n\n487\n00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:19.700\nSo I'll see the archive manager.\n\n488\n00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:21.030\nI didn't install that.\n\n489\n00:22:21.030 --> 00:22:23.230\nIt was installed as part of the OS.\n\n490\n00:22:23.230 --> 00:22:25.940\nSo it's there and\nI can remove it if I don't want it.\n\n491\n00:22:25.940 --> 00:22:29.650\nThere's a solitaire program, well maybe\nI don't want any games on my system.\n\n492\n00:22:29.650 --> 00:22:32.130\nI can just hit remove,\nand that'll uninstall it.\n\n493\n00:22:32.130 --> 00:22:35.360\nAnd it's all alphabetized, so if I wanna\nget rid of that graphic editor I'd go\n\n494\n00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:38.870\nthrough and I can find it,\nit will be in here somewhere.\n\n495\n00:22:38.870 --> 00:22:44.730\nAnd then we can take it in and pull it\nout and did I, there it is right there.\n\n496\n00:22:44.730 --> 00:22:47.258\nIt is tough because sometimes,\nlike this program,\n\n497\n00:22:47.258 --> 00:22:50.705\nyou'll see it referenced by its\nabbreviation, GIMP and other times,\n\n498\n00:22:50.705 --> 00:22:53.760\nyou'll see it referenced as\nGNU Image Manipulation Program.\n\n499\n00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:55.910\nSo you gotta kinda find\nit alphabetically there.\n\n500\n00:22:55.910 --> 00:22:58.900\nBut there it is and I can hit remove and\n\n501\n00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:03.100\nit kept track of all the files this\ncreated when it was installed and\n\n502\n00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:06.090\nall the links that it created,\nthe libraries and the other things.\n\n503\n00:23:06.090 --> 00:23:09.450\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic.\n&gt;&gt; And so when I give it my credentials,\n\n504\n00:23:09.450 --> 00:23:12.080\nit's gonna go and remove all those and\nmake sure it's done nice and\n\n505\n00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:16.130\nclean versus if I do it manually, I might\nmiss things and cause some problems.\n\n506\n00:23:16.130 --> 00:23:18.920\nThis is gonna be nice and clean and\nnow that software's removed.\n\n507\n00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:21.490\nAnd because it's free,\nif I ever need it again I can just go and\n\n508\n00:23:21.490 --> 00:23:23.945\ninstall it again,\nit only took a few minutes.\n\n509\n00:23:23.945 --> 00:23:27.220\nWell, Chrome, Chrome is taking forever\nto install in the background so\n\n510\n00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:28.827\nmaybe it isn't going to\ntake a few minutes but\n\n511\n00:23:28.827 --> 00:23:32.700\nlike GIMP installed very quickly,\nvery smoothly and it was done.\n\n512\n00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:35.380\nOther applications can take\na little longer, it just depends.\n\n513\n00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:39.840\nBut it is such an easy thing to do and\nthis software center makes life so\n\n514\n00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:40.950\nmuch easier.\n\n515\n00:23:40.950 --> 00:23:44.460\nBut, this is where you'll generally want\nto go to just completely manage the life\n\n516\n00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:48.710\ncycle of your software from installing\nto updating and to ultimately removing.\n\n517\n00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:51.620\nAnd one of the new versions, even a major\nversion of the software comes out it'll\n\n518\n00:23:51.620 --> 00:23:53.150\nsimply replace the old\nversion of software.\n\n519\n00:23:53.150 --> 00:23:54.670\nThat's part of the update cycle.\n\n520\n00:23:54.670 --> 00:23:57.000\nAnd then you remove it when you're done or\nyou find something better.\n\n521\n00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:58.940\nSo all easy stuff to deal with.\n\n522\n00:23:58.940 --> 00:23:59.990\n&gt;&gt; Well done, Don.\n\n523\n00:23:59.990 --> 00:24:05.080\nLinux for Beginners Installing Software,\nfascinating too.\n\n524\n00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:07.875\nSome things look very easy,\nsome things may be more tricky.\n\n525\n00:24:07.875 --> 00:24:09.760\nAnything else you wanna leave us with.\n\n526\n00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:13.370\n&gt;&gt; You know the only thing I really\nwanna mention is that sometimes\n\n527\n00:24:13.370 --> 00:24:16.190\nsoftware is written in a way where there\nmight be more than one version of it and\n\n528\n00:24:16.190 --> 00:24:19.100\nthey allow you to have more than one\nversion installed at the same time.\n\n529\n00:24:19.100 --> 00:24:23.340\nSo maybe I have like Libre Office.\n\n530\n00:24:23.340 --> 00:24:25.260\nThe open office software\nwhich is great software,\n\n531\n00:24:25.260 --> 00:24:28.390\nif you haven't heard of it before,\ndefinitely look up Libre Office.\n\n532\n00:24:28.390 --> 00:24:31.120\nThey may release a new version\nthat's significantly changed.\n\n533\n00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:33.690\nAnd so they leave the old\nversion available as well.\n\n534\n00:24:33.690 --> 00:24:35.370\nAnd you may be able to\ninstall them side by side.\n\n535\n00:24:35.370 --> 00:24:37.750\nIt is possible not always, but\n\n536\n00:24:37.750 --> 00:24:41.070\nin some scenarios to have multiple\nversions of the same software.\n\n537\n00:24:41.070 --> 00:24:45.005\nSo if you ever bring up your menu and\nyou see multiple icons for one program,\n\n538\n00:24:45.005 --> 00:24:47.890\nit usually means you've got\nan old version and a new version.\n\n539\n00:24:47.890 --> 00:24:51.630\nAnd to sort that out just go in to\nthe app store, in the software app and\n\n540\n00:24:51.630 --> 00:24:56.190\nfind where those programs are and you can\nuninstall the old version from there so\n\n541\n00:24:56.190 --> 00:24:58.380\nyou just have the new one\nthat helps to avoid that.\n\n542\n00:24:58.380 --> 00:25:01.050\nBut if you ever see multiple icons,\nthat's usually what that indicates.\n\n543\n00:25:01.050 --> 00:25:03.420\n&gt;&gt; And the app store the other\nname is repository, too.\n\n544\n00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:04.670\nYes?\n&gt;&gt; Right, absolutely.\n\n545\n00:25:04.670 --> 00:25:05.210\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n546\n00:25:05.210 --> 00:25:07.510\nWell, installing software,\nLinux for beginners.\n\n547\n00:25:07.510 --> 00:25:10.360\nI'm sure you like this episode and\nthere's all kinds of video content.\n\n548\n00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:12.590\nIn the links for beginners series,\nand make sure you watch all of them.\n\n549\n00:25:12.590 --> 00:25:15.960\nYou'll be glad you did, and\nthank you
