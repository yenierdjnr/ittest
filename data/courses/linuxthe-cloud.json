Well in this series we're gonna be\ntaking a look at what it's like to run\n\n6\n00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.100\nthe Linux operating system on\ntop of various cloud services.\n\n7\n00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.970\nA lot of people are virtualizing\nenvironments now, either doing\n\n8\n00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:26.130\nit in private clouds or public clouds and\nclinics is a big part of that.\n\n9\n00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.490\nFor the most, it runs kind of the same\non an actual hardware verses on cloud or\n\n10\n00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:32.300\nvirtualized hardware.\n\n11\n00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.550\nBut in this series we're gonna\nfocus on those little differences,\n\n12\n00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.650\nthe things that make it a little bit\ndifferent that people get intimidated by.\n\n13\n00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:40.630\nThe view it as a risk,\nthey don't want to deploy.\n\n14\n00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:43.910\nWe're gonna take a look at what's involved\nin that and see what it takes to actually\n\n15\n00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.990\nget this up and\nrunning in a modern cloud infrastructure.\n\n16\n00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:49.550\n&gt;&gt; Okay, and\nwho is this show targeted towards?\n\n17\n00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:51.968\n&gt;&gt; Mainly this is gonna be targeted\ntowards system administrators.\n\n18\n00:00:51.968 --> 00:00:55.424\nIf you're responsible for supporting\na Linux infrastructure, and you've got\n\n19\n00:00:55.424 --> 00:00:59.000\non-premises equipment and now you're\nstarting to make that step into the cloud.\n\n20\n00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.040\nBe it a private cloud with your\nown virtualization servers or\n\n21\n00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.930\na public cloud with Amazon,\nor Microsoft, or\n\n22\n00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.810\nsomebody like that,\nit's a little tricky to make that jump.\n\n23\n00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:10.920\nAnd so\nthis is really targeted towards you.\n\n24\n00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.740\n&gt;&gt; So Don,\nis there a certification involved in this?\n\n25\n00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.600\n&gt;&gt; There's a number of cloud\ncertifications out there, but\n\n26\n00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.660\nwe're not gonna focus on that.\n\n27\n00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:19.440\nWe're just gonna try and\nkeep this as an introductory type thing,\n\n28\n00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.020\nthat's general audience.\n\n29\n00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.350\nIf you just wanna learn and be aware,\nthat's what this series is all about.\n\n30\n00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.044\nSo it's more focused on a technical\nskill than it is a certification.\n\n31\n00:01:28.044 --> 00:01:30.039\n&gt;&gt; And,\nwhat topics are available in this show?\n\n32\n00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:33.520\n&gt;&gt; Well, we're really covering\npretty much anything people ask for.\n\n33\n00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.770\nBut the main ones that we're gonna cover\nhere initially are gonna be Linux on KVM.\n\n34\n00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.540\nKVM is tha Kernel Virtual Machine.\n\n35\n00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.810\nIt's the service that really Amazon\nweb services uses under the hood,\n\n36\n00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:44.840\nyou can run it privately.\n\n37\n00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.044\nSo we'll talk about it KVM host and\n\n38\n00:01:47.044 --> 00:01:50.315\nthen actually run Linux as\nKVM guest on top of that.\n\n39\n00:01:50.315 --> 00:01:54.112\nSo creating a virtualized environment\nentirely off of open source KVM.\n\n40\n00:01:54.112 --> 00:01:56.107\nThen we'll take a look at Amazon EC2.\n\n41\n00:01:56.107 --> 00:01:59.993\nSo if you're using the elastic compute\ncloud and you're deploying instances,\n\n42\n00:01:59.993 --> 00:02:03.949\nVM's there, we'll see what it's like to\nget Linux up and running inside of AWS.\n\n43\n00:02:03.949 --> 00:02:06.065\nThen we're gonna move into\nthe Microsoft side of thing,\n\n44\n00:02:06.065 --> 00:02:07.220\nI know it's funny to say that.\n\n45\n00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:08.840\nWell we're gonna talk about\nMicrosoft on a Linux show.\n\n46\n00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.424\nBut it's really important because\nMicrosoft Azure is the number two player\n\n47\n00:02:12.424 --> 00:02:16.019\nin cloud services right now, they have\ncreated a massive infrastructure.\n\n48\n00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:18.611\nSo we'll see how to build up\nour Linux virtual machines,\n\n49\n00:02:18.611 --> 00:02:20.075\nget them thrown on top of Azure.\n\n50\n00:02:20.075 --> 00:02:23.898\nAnd even though we're using a Microsoft\nservice we can still say in the Linux\n\n51\n00:02:23.898 --> 00:02:26.390\nworld and deploy things that we want.\n\n52\n00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.520\nAnd then we're also going to really\nbridge the gap and talk about Docker.\n\n53\n00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.520\nDocker is a IT industry buzz word and\nif you're a developer, you've\n\n54\n00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:38.080\ngot to learn that system administrators\nare largely being neglected on this.\n\n55\n00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.460\nAnd so I wanna take the time to show you\nguys what Docker is, how it works, and\n\n56\n00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:45.570\nwe'll see how we can run Linux\ninside of our Docker containers.\n\n57\n00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:49.340\nAs well as use Linux as our Docker host\nto be able to power that environment and\n\n58\n00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:50.570\ngive a chance to see that.\n\n59\n00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:53.810\nSo these are all pretty typical\ncloud type deployments, and\n\n60\n00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.570\nwe're gonna walk through them,\nget comfortable with it, and\n\n61\n00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:00.710\nmake it where we can all recognize how\nwe can be using Linux as a ,loud OS.\n\n62\n00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:01.340\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, Don.\n\n63\n00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:06.033\nSo Linux in the Cloud sounds like a show\nyou'd be interested in, and it should be,\n\n64\n00:03:06.033 --> 00:03:09.518\nwatch every single episode of\nLinux in the Cloud on ITProTV.\n\n65\n00:03:09.518 --> 00:03:14.243\n[MUSIC]\n\n",
