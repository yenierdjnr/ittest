overview of the upcoming\n\n4\n00:00:12.888 --> 00:00:16.553\nMac Integration Basic series that we\nhave coming up here on ITProTV, and\n\n5\n00:00:16.553 --> 00:00:17.810\njoining me here is Don.\n\n6\n00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:21.517\nAnd Don, we have a few questions we're\ngonna ask you maybe give you some answers\n\n7\n00:00:21.517 --> 00:00:23.747\nhere about this upcoming and\nexciting series.\n\n8\n00:00:23.747 --> 00:00:27.361\n[LAUGH] The first one is, generally, what\nare we going to experience when it comes\n\n9\n00:00:27.361 --> 00:00:31.190\nto Mac Integration Basics, what does\nthat mean, what can we expect to see?\n\n10\n00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:34.460\n>> All right, well, Mac Integration Basics\nis one of the two exams that you can take\n\n11\n00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.130\nto get the Apple Certified Associate, or\n\n12\n00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:38.620\nACA certification,\nyou only gotta pass one of them.\n\n13\n00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:39.260\nYou get to pick.\n\n14\n00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.070\nThis is just one of those two.\n\n15\n00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.030\nThe other one is Mac Management Basics.\n\n16\n00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:47.870\nNow, Mac Management Basics focuses\nstrictly on managing Macs, thus the name.\n\n17\n00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.690\nVersus this one, Mac Integration Basics,\nwhich actually focuses more\n\n18\n00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.640\non getting your Macs to play\nwell with Windows machines.\n\n19\n00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:54.740\nI know what you're saying.\n\n20\n00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:55.870\nWhat do I care about Windows, right?\n\n21\n00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:59.550\nBut in the business world,\nyou're gonna find where most environments\n\n22\n00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.240\nare not 100% Mac, or\neven 100% Windows anymore.\n\n23\n00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:06.650\nNow you oftentimes have environments\nwhere you've got a mixture of the two.\n\n24\n00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.120\nAnd getting them to play nice is kind\nof an important step that we have to go\n\n25\n00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:11.590\nthrough to get these things communicating.\n\n26\n00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.630\nSo what we find is that,\nif you work for a company,\n\n27\n00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.150\nif you're an IT administrator and\nyou're tasked with supporting Macs on your\n\n28\n00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.590\nnetwork, you need to have a knowledge\nof some of those functions,\n\n29\n00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.160\nhow these things work and Mac\nIntegration Basics is what covers that.\n\n30\n00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.920\n>> Yeah, Don, you actually started\nhinting at my next questions,\n\n31\n00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.870\nwhich is, who is this series intended for?\n\n32\n00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:36.070\n>> Yeah, it's really going to be\nthose IT administrators right?\n\n33\n00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.730\nSo, if you're a home user and you've got\na couple of Mac's, this is not for you.\n\n34\n00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:43.897\nIf you've got a, let's say you work for\na company that's 100% Mac based, well,\n\n35\n00:01:43.897 --> 00:01:45.210\nagain, this one's not for\n\n36\n00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.080\nyou cause we're gonna show you how\nto integrate systems you don't have.\n\n37\n00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.150\nSo for you to jump over to Mac Management\nBasics, that's a better one for you, cause\n\n38\n00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:56.110\nyou learn all the different ways to manage\nyour Macs and there's really cool stuff.\n\n39\n00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.620\nBut if you've got that mix,\nif you're an IT administrator and\n\n40\n00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:01.130\nyou're responsible for Windows and\nMac, this is the show for\n\n41\n00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.040\nyou cause we show how to\nmix those two together.\n\n42\n00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.600\n>> All right, now that we know\nwhat the show's gonna be about,\n\n43\n00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.625\ngenerally, and who it's for.\n\n44\n00:02:07.625 --> 00:02:11.900\nWet our appetites just a bit and\ngive us some topic details,\n\n45\n00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.040\nsome of the things that we're\ngonna see in the series.\n\n46\n00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.651\n>> Sure.\n\n47\n00:02:14.651 --> 00:02:17.860\nSo, I've got an exam outlined here\nthat we'll be using to guide the show.\n\n48\n00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.292\nLet me just bring this\nup here on the screen.\n\n49\n00:02:19.292 --> 00:02:21.750\nAnd basically we're gonna start off\ntalking about network accounts, right?\n\n50\n00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.670\nWhere are user accounts exist because\nyou've got like active directory,\n\n51\n00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:25.800\nan open directory, and all that stuff.\n\n52\n00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.285\nSo we're kind of start off with those.\n\n53\n00:02:27.285 --> 00:02:29.000\nWe'll talking about file sharing and\n\n54\n00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.400\nhow to get files to transfer over\nthe network between Windows and Macs.\n\n55\n00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.320\nAnd then we'll take a look at email,\ncalendars, and contacts so\n\n56\n00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.130\nI like to call it collaboration software.\n\n57\n00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.920\nWays that we can communicate where\nyour clients might be Macs but\n\n58\n00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.230\nyour servers might be Windows based and\nyou've got to handle that too.\n\n59\n00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.010\nWe'll also take a look at security.\n\n60\n00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.930\nThere are a ton of security\nfeatures inside of Mac OS and\n\n61\n00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:51.530\nthey all help protect you.\n\n62\n00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.900\nBut some of them get in the way\nof you communicating with other\n\n63\n00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:54.600\nmachines on the network.\n\n64\n00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.710\nSo we've gotta understand what\neach of those systems do and\n\n65\n00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:59.100\nfigure out how to get\nthat configured properly.\n\n66\n00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.410\nThen we take a look at printing.\n\n67\n00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:02.870\nPrinting is less important\nthese days than it used to be.\n\n68\n00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.050\nBut many,\nmany environments still have printers.\n\n69\n00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.460\nSo we've gotta be able to connect\nto those and manage that system.\n\n70\n00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:10.830\nAnd then,\nwe take a look at instant messaging.\n\n71\n00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:11.540\nRight?\n\n72\n00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.680\nThis is the messenger\napp inside of Mac OS.\n\n73\n00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.560\nA lot of people use it with iTunes and\niCloud.\n\n74\n00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.050\nBut, you can actually use\nit non Mac chat servers.\n\n75\n00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:23.510\nSo, we'll see a chance to work with that.\n\n76\n00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:26.390\nLastly, we get to see\nwhat's really important.\n\n77\n00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:27.710\nData management and back up.\n\n78\n00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:29.120\nRight?\nProtecting our data and\n\n79\n00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.300\nbeing able to restore it.\n\n80\n00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.910\nAnd cross platform compatibility.\n\n81\n00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:37.720\nIt might not be that I have a Mac and\na Windows machine, it might be that I have\n\n82\n00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.788\none machine that I need to do both,\nrun Mac and Windows applications.\n\n83\n00:03:41.788 --> 00:03:43.990\nSo, we talk about a few\ndifferent ways to do that and\n\n84\n00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:48.270\nsome really neat infrastructure that helps\nyou transition from one over to the other.\n\n85\n00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.790\n>> All right, Don.\n\n86\n00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:50.640\nSo now that we have some\nmore of the detail.\n\n87\n00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.170\nWe have some more of the basic\noverview of what we're looking at,\n\n88\n00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:57.060\nyou did mention an exam, and\nI'm guessing that most of the good\n\n89\n00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.170\npeople that are gonna be watching this\nare gonna want to take that exam.\n\n90\n00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:01.340\nGive us some of the details on that.\n\n91\n00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.940\nWhat can I do?\nI want to get signed up and take it.\n\n92\n00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:04.680\nWhat do I got to do?\n\n93\n00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:05.910\n>> This is one of the nice ones.\n\n94\n00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:07.480\nIf you want to get your ACA,\n\n95\n00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.780\nyou don't have to go to some\nspecial testing center somewhere.\n\n96\n00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:10.940\nYou don't have to go to Apple.\n\n97\n00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:12.960\nYou can actually take it from\nthe comfort of your own home.\n\n98\n00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:16.750\nYou could just go right over to Apple's\nwebsite and sign up for the exam and\n\n99\n00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:18.440\ntake it tonight, if you want.\n\n100\n00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:19.210\nIt's really nice.\n\n101\n00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:20.400\nAnd it's pretty inexpensive too.\n\n102\n00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.260\nIt's $65, which is a lot\nless than a lot of the other\n\n103\n00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:24.730\ncertification exams that are out there.\n\n104\n00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:27.960\nI've got the details kind of\npulled up here from their website.\n\n105\n00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:33.249\nIf you go to\ntraining.apple.com/itpro/macinteg,\n\n106\n00:04:33.249 --> 00:04:36.670\ni-n-t-e-g, /1011 exam.\n\n107\n00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:38.210\nRight, that's that URL right.\n\n108\n00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.880\nLet me zoom in on that.\n\n109\n00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:39.750\nThere we go.\n\n110\n00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.070\nSo you see that URL, but\nif you go to that webpage,\n\n111\n00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:46.500\nthey have all the exam information right\nthere and so you'll see it's $65, you get\n\n112\n00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:50.790\ntwo hours to take it, and you can take it\nright from the comfort of your own home.\n\n113\n00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:54.461\nThey’ve got the link right\nhere training.apple.com/acrs.\n\n114\n00:04:54.461 --> 00:04:58.490\nYou can take the exam, as soon as you’re\ndone you will immediately get a pass or\n\n115\n00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:01.460\na fail score so you will know that\nyou’ve passed, you’re certified.\n\n116\n00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:02.500\nAnd you're ready to rock.\n\n117\n00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:03.530\nIt's all right there.\n\n118\n00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:06.260\nAll in all one of the better testing\nexperiences that are out there.\n\n119\n00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:07.430\nAll right, that's basically it.\n\n120\n00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:11.980\nThat is the Mac Integration Basics ACE\nin a nutshell and it's a lot of fun.\n\n121\n00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:15.220\nIt's definitely a good time, if you\nare that person responsible for Macs and\n\n122\n00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:16.830\nWindows, this is the place to be.\n\n123\n00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:18.610\nSo that sounds exciting.\n\n124\n00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:19.140\nStay tuned.\n\n125\n00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:20.450\nThese episodes are coming up.\n\n126\n00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:24.120\nIf it doesn't sound too terribly exciting,\nif you just work in the Mac only world,\n\n127\n00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.230\nthen jump over and\ncheck out our Mac Management Basics.\n\n128\n00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:27.170\nIt's already filmed.\n\n129\n00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:28.520\nIt's already in our course library.\n\n130\n00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:29.680\nYou can certainly watch that.\n\n131\n00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.540\nAnd if you wanna learn more\nabout Windows or Linux,\n\n132\n00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:34.190\nwe've got plenty of other courses\non that in our library too.\n\n133\n00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:37.592\nBut for those of you that are sticking\nwith me from Mac Integration Basics,\n\n134\n00:05:37.592 --> 00:05:39.001\nwell, enough me rambling on.\n\n135\n00:05:39.001 --> 00:05:41.393\nLet's get this show started.\n\n136\n00:05:41.393 --> 00:05:47.834\n[MUSIC]\n\n",
