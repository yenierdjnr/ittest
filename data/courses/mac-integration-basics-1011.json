overview of the upcoming\n\n4\n00:00:12.888 --> 00:00:16.553\nMac Integration Basic series that we\nhave coming up here on ITProTV, and\n\n5\n00:00:16.553 --> 00:00:17.810\njoining me here is Don.\n\n6\n00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:21.517\nAnd Don, we have a few questions we're\ngonna ask you maybe give you some answers\n\n7\n00:00:21.517 --> 00:00:23.747\nhere about this upcoming and\nexciting series.\n\n8\n00:00:23.747 --> 00:00:27.361\n[LAUGH] The first one is, generally, what\nare we going to experience when it comes\n\n9\n00:00:27.361 --> 00:00:31.190\nto Mac Integration Basics, what does\nthat mean, what can we expect to see?\n\n10\n00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:34.460\n>> All right, well, Mac Integration Basics\nis one of the two exams that you can take\n\n11\n00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.130\nto get the Apple Certified Associate, or\n\n12\n00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:38.620\nACA certification,\nyou only gotta pass one of them.\n\n13\n00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:39.260\nYou get to pick.\n\n14\n00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.070\nThis is just one of those two.\n\n15\n00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.030\nThe other one is Mac Management Basics.\n\n16\n00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:47.870\nNow, Mac Management Basics focuses\nstrictly on managing Macs, thus the name.\n\n17\n00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.690\nVersus this one, Mac Integration Basics,\nwhich actually focuses more\n\n18\n00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.640\non getting your Macs to play\nwell with Windows machines.\n\n19\n00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:54.740\nI know what you're saying.\n\n20\n00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:55.870\nWhat do I care about Windows, right?\n\n21\n00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:59.550\nBut in the business world,\nyou're gonna find where most environments\n\n22\n00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.240\nare not 100% Mac, or\neven 100% Windows anymore.\n\n23\n00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:06.650\nNow you oftentimes have environments\nwhere you've got a mixture of the two.\n\n24\n00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.120\nAnd getting them to play nice is kind\nof an important step that we have to go\n\n25\n00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:11.590\nthrough to get these things communicating.\n\n26\n00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.630\nSo what we find is that,\nif you work for a company,\n\n27\n00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.150\nif you're an IT administrator and\nyou're tasked with supporting Macs on your\n\n28\n00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.590\nnetwork, you need to have a knowledge\nof some of those functions,\n\n29\n00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.160\nhow these things work and Mac\nIntegration Basics is what covers that.\n\n30\n00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.920\n>> Yeah, Don, you actually started\nhinting at my next questions,\n\n31\n00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.870\nwhich is, who is this series intended for?\n\n32\n00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:36.070\n>> Yeah, it's really going to be\nthose IT administrators right?\n\n33\n00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.730\nSo, if you're a home user and you've got\na couple of Mac's, this is not for you.\n\n34\n00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:43.897\nIf you've got a, let's say you work for\na company that's 100% Mac based, well,\n\n35\n00:01:43.897 --> 00:01:45.210\nagain, this one's not for\n\n36\n00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.080\nyou cause we're gonna show you how\nto integrate systems you don't have.\n\n37\n00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.150\nSo for you to jump over to Mac Management\nBasics, that's a better one for you, cause\n\n38\n00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:56.110\nyou learn all the different ways to manage\nyour Macs and there's really cool stuff.\n\n39\n00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.620\nBut if you've got that mix,\nif you're an IT administrator and\n\n40\n00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:01.130\nyou're responsible for Windows and\nMac, this is the show for\n\n41\n00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.040\nyou cause we show how to\nmix those two together.\n\n42\n00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.600\n>> All right, now that we know\nwhat the show's gonna be about,\n\n43\n00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.625\ngenerally, and who it's for.\n\n44\n00:02:07.625 --> 00:02:11.900\nWet our appetites just a bit and\ngive us some topic details,\n\n45\n00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.040\nsome of the things that we're\ngonna see in the series.\n\n46\n00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.651\n>> Sure.\n\n47\n00:02:14.651 --> 00:02:17.860\nSo, I've got an exam outlined here\nthat we'll be using to guide the show.\n\n48\n00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.292\nLet me just bring this\nup here on the screen.\n\n49\n00:02:19.292 --> 00:02:21.750\nAnd basically we're gonna start off\ntalking about network accounts, right?\n\n50\n00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.670\nWhere are user accounts exist because\nyou've got like active directory,\n\n51\n00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:25.800\nan open directory, and all that stuff.\n\n52\n00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.285\nSo we're kind of start off with those.\n\n53\n00:02:27.285 --> 00:02:29.000\nWe'll talking about file sharing and\n\n54\n00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.400\nhow to get files to transfer over\nthe network between Windows and Macs.\n\n55\n00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.320\nAnd then we'll take a look at email,\ncalendars, and contacts so\n\n56\n00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.130\nI like to call it collaboration software.\n\n57\n00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.920\nWays that we can communicate where\nyour clients might be Macs but\n\n58\n00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.230\nyour servers might be Windows based and\nyou've got to handle that too.\n\n59\n00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.010\nWe'll also take a look at security.\n\n60\n00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.930\nThere are a ton of security\nfeatures inside of Mac OS and\n\n61\n00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:51.530\nthey all help protect you.\n\n62\n00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.900\nBut some of them get in the way\nof you communicating with other\n\n63\n00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:54.600\nmachines on the network.\n\n64\n00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.710\nSo we've gotta understand what\neach of those systems do and\n\n65\n00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:59.100\nfigure out how to get\nthat configured properly.\n\n66\n00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.410\nThen we take a look at printing.\n\n67\n00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:02.870\nPrinting is less important\nthese days than it used to be.\n\n68\n00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.050\nBut many,\nmany environments still have printers.\n\n69\n00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.460\nSo we've gotta be able to connect\nto those and manage that system.\n\n70\n00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:10.830\nAnd then,\nwe take a look at instant messaging.\n\n71\n00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:11.540\nRight?\n\n72\n00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.680\nThis is the messenger\napp inside of Mac OS.\n\n73\n00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.560\nA lot of people use it with iTunes and\niCloud.\n\n74\n00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.050\nBut, you can actually use\nit non Mac chat servers.\n\n75\n00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:23.510\nSo, we'll see a chance to work with that.\n\n76\n00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:26.390\nLastly, we get to see\nwhat's really important.\n\n77\n00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:27.710\nData management and back up.\n\n78\n00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:29.120\nRight?\nProtecting our data and\n\n79\n00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.300\nbeing able to restore it.\n\n80\n00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.910\nAnd cross platform compatibility.\n\n81\n00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:37.720\nIt might not be that I have a Mac and\na Windows machine, it might be that I have\n\n82\n00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.788\none machine that I need to do both,\nrun Mac and Windows applications.\n\n83\n00:03:41.788 --> 00:03:43.990\nSo, we talk about a few\ndifferent ways to do that and\n\n84\n00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:48.270\nsome really neat infrastructure that helps\nyou transition from one over to the other.\n\n85\n00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.790\n>> All right, Don.\n\n86\n00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:50.640\nSo now that we have some\nmore of the detail.\n\n87\n00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.170\nWe have some more of the basic\noverview of what we're looking at,\n\n88\n00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:57.060\nyou did mention an exam, and\nI'm guessing that most of the good\n\n89\n00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.170\npeople that are gonna be watching this\nare gonna want to take that exam.\n\n90\n00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:01.340\nGive us some of the details on that.\n\n91\n00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.940\nWhat can I do?\nI want to get signed up and take it.\n\n92\n00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:04.680\nWhat do I got to do?\n\n93\n00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:05.910\n>> This is one of the nice ones.\n\n94\n00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:07.480\nIf you want to get your ACA,\n\n95\n00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.780\nyou don't have to go to some\nspecial testing center somewhere.\n\n96\n00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:10.940\nYou don't have to go to Apple.\n\n97\n00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:12.960\nYou can actually take it from\nthe comfort of your own home.\n\n98\n00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:16.750\nYou could just go right over to Apple's\nwebsite and sign up for the exam and\n\n99\n00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:18.440\ntake it tonight, if you want.\n\n100\n00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:19.210\nIt's really nice.\n\n101\n00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:20.400\nAnd it's pretty inexpensive too.\n\n102\n00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.260\nIt's $65, which is a lot\nless than a lot of the other\n\n103\n00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:24.730\ncertification exams that are out there.\n\n104\n00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:27.960\nI've got the details kind of\npulled up here from their website.\n\n105\n00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:33.249\nIf you go to\ntraining.apple.com/itpro/macinteg,\n\n106\n00:04:33.249 --> 00:04:36.670\ni-n-t-e-g, /1011 exam.\n\n107\n00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:38.210\nRight, that's that URL right.\n\n108\n00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.880\nLet me zoom in on that.\n\n109\n00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:39.750\nThere we go.\n\n110\n00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.070\nSo you see that URL, but\nif you go to that webpage,\n\n111\n00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:46.500\nthey have all the exam information right\nthere and so you'll see it's $65, you get\n\n112\n00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:50.790\ntwo hours to take it, and you can take it\nright from the comfort of your own home.\n\n113\n00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:54.461\nThey’ve got the link right\nhere training.apple.com/acrs.\n\n114\n00:04:54.461 --> 00:04:58.490\nYou can take the exam, as soon as you’re\ndone you will immediately get a pass or\n\n115\n00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:01.460\na fail score so you will know that\nyou’ve passed, you’re certified.\n\n116\n00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:02.500\nAnd you're ready to rock.\n\n117\n00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:03.530\nIt's all right there.\n\n118\n00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:06.260\nAll in all one of the better testing\nexperiences that are out there.\n\n119\n00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:07.430\nAll right, that's basically it.\n\n120\n00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:11.980\nThat is the Mac Integration Basics ACE\nin a nutshell and it's a lot of fun.\n\n121\n00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:15.220\nIt's definitely a good time, if you\nare that person responsible for Macs and\n\n122\n00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:16.830\nWindows, this is the place to be.\n\n123\n00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:18.610\nSo that sounds exciting.\n\n124\n00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:19.140\nStay tuned.\n\n125\n00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:20.450\nThese episodes are coming up.\n\n126\n00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:24.120\nIf it doesn't sound too terribly exciting,\nif you just work in the Mac only world,\n\n127\n00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.230\nthen jump over and\ncheck out our Mac Management Basics.\n\n128\n00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:27.170\nIt's already filmed.\n\n129\n00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:28.520\nIt's already in our course library.\n\n130\n00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:29.680\nYou can certainly watch that.\n\n131\n00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.540\nAnd if you wanna learn more\nabout Windows or Linux,\n\n132\n00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:34.190\nwe've got plenty of other courses\non that in our library too.\n\n133\n00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:37.592\nBut for those of you that are sticking\nwith me from Mac Integration Basics,\n\n134\n00:05:37.592 --> 00:05:39.001\nwell, enough me rambling on.\n\n135\n00:05:39.001 --> 00:05:41.393\nLet's get this show started.\n\n136\n00:05:41.393 --> 00:05:47.834\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

series,\n\n5\n00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:26.130\nMac integration basic series,\nshould I say, to get that right.\n\n6\n00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.860\nJoining us in the studio today is our good\nfriend and mentor in that very endeavor,\n\n7\n00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:31.170\nis our friend Don Bizet.\n\n8\n00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.400\nDon, welcome to the show, sir.\n\n9\n00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.520\n>> Thanks for having me back, Daniel,\n\n10\n00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.400\nand just ready to jump into\nanother exciting Mac series.\n\n11\n00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.360\nWe're gonna kick this one off big\nstyle and not mess around with\n\n12\n00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.350\nthe simple outlines or anything like that\nand dive right into directory servers.\n\n13\n00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.740\nNow this is pretty cool because I know\n\n14\n00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:48.130\nmany of you guys watch\nthe Mac Management Basic series.\n\n15\n00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:50.270\nWe've covered Apple's Open Directory,\n\n16\n00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:54.880\nwhich is a great way to have centralized\nuser accounts in an all Apple environment.\n\n17\n00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:56.830\nBut if you're dealing\nwith Windows servers,\n\n18\n00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:00.430\nyou might have a different directory\nserver, like Microsoft's Active Directory.\n\n19\n00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:04.090\nAnd in this episode, we're gonna take\na look at how we can get our Mac clients\n\n20\n00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:07.420\nto be all friendly and cozy up nice\nto Microsoft's Active Directory.\n\n21\n00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.760\nNow before I dive into those, let's start\nwith something a little bit more basic,\n\n22\n00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.530\ncuz this is the basic show.\n\n23\n00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.200\nWhat the heck is a directory server,\nright?\n\n24\n00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.030\nMaybe you don't know.\n\n25\n00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.660\nMaybe you haven't seen the Mac Management\nBasics series, and that's perfectly fine.\n\n26\n00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:24.050\nSo, a directory server is a centralized\ndatabase of user accounts.\n\n27\n00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:26.290\nNow, normally on a Mac,\nwhen you create a user account,\n\n28\n00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:28.730\nit's created right there\non that individual Mac.\n\n29\n00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:31.890\nSo, Daniel's got a Macbook right here,\nI've got a Macbook.\n\n30\n00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.060\nIf I create a user account on my Mac,\nI can't go to Daniel's laptop and\n\n31\n00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.010\nlog in as me.\n\n32\n00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:38.530\nThe account doesn't exist there.\n\n33\n00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.102\nThe account exists only on my laptop.\n\n34\n00:01:41.102 --> 00:01:42.780\nAnd you guys have probably\nworked with these before.\n\n35\n00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:43.890\nLet me just show you real quick here.\n\n36\n00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:44.900\nI'll take this one.\n\n37\n00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.740\nSo here's an El Capitan install.\n\n38\n00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.080\nIt's pretty much stock.\n\n39\n00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.340\nAnd I'm gonna go up here\ninto my System Preferences.\n\n40\n00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.680\nAnd into the Users and Groups system\npreference whenever it comes up.\n\n41\n00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.400\nThere it is, Users and Groups.\n\n42\n00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.900\nAnd when I go in here,\nwe're gonna see local users, right?\n\n43\n00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.850\nI've got my user that I created\nwhen I installed El Capitan, right?\n\n44\n00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.430\nIt asked me to pick a user name, so there\nI am, Don Pezet, and it made me an admin.\n\n45\n00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:09.610\nAnd then there's a guest account.\n\n46\n00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.940\nAnd the guest account's turned off\nunless you turn on find my Mac.\n\n47\n00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.010\nThat'll enable it.\n\n48\n00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.540\nBut in this case,\nI just have the one user account.\n\n49\n00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.780\nAnd if I start adding more user accounts,\nthey're just added right here on this Mac.\n\n50\n00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.150\nNow, for a home user, that's fine.\n\n51\n00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.160\nIf you're a home user,\nif this is your Mac, and\n\n52\n00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.600\nyou're the only one that uses it,\nwho cares?\n\n53\n00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.850\nYou just have the one account and\nthat's it.\n\n54\n00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.660\nBut if you work in a business or\na school and you've got hundreds or\n\n55\n00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.228\neven thousands of Macs, I want to be able\nto sit at one computer and log in as me,\n\n56\n00:02:38.228 --> 00:02:41.926\nand then get up and go to another\ncomputer and still log in as me.\n\n57\n00:02:41.926 --> 00:02:44.297\nAnd I don't want to have to create\na user account on every single\n\n58\n00:02:44.297 --> 00:02:45.710\nmachine to do that.\n\n59\n00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:48.060\nIt's even more important\nwhen it comes to changes.\n\n60\n00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.830\nWhat if I need to reset my password?\n\n61\n00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.890\nWell, I don't wanna go to 1,000\ncomputers and change my password.\n\n62\n00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:56.150\nI wanna do it in one place and\nbe done with it.\n\n63\n00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:57.750\nOr what if we terminate an employee?\n\n64\n00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.177\nLike, Daniel over here has been coasting\non the edge for quite some time.\n\n65\n00:03:00.177 --> 00:03:03.140\nIf we decide to cut him loose,\nI need to disable his account.\n\n66\n00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.130\nAnd I don't wanna have to go\nto 1,000 computers to do it,\n\n67\n00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:06.870\nthat's way too much time for\nhim to wreak some havoc.\n\n68\n00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.020\nI wanna have a central place that\nI go to to manage those accounts.\n\n69\n00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:12.965\nAnd that's what a directory does for us.\n\n70\n00:03:12.965 --> 00:03:17.480\nIt gives us that central user database\nwhere all the user accounts exist not on\n\n71\n00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.540\nan individual machine but\nin a centralized server.\n\n72\n00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.250\nNow Apple has a product that does that.\n\n73\n00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:27.440\nSo here I am on another Mac\nthat's running the server app,\n\n74\n00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.667\nso this is my OSX-SERVER01 machine.\n\n75\n00:03:29.667 --> 00:03:31.610\nIt's running the server app.\n\n76\n00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:34.680\nAnd in the server app if you\ndig down under Advanced,\n\n77\n00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.250\nyou'll see where there's\nthe Open Directory, right?\n\n78\n00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:41.910\nThat's Apple's own directory service,\nand it's based on OpenLDAP.\n\n79\n00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:45.550\nLDAP is\nthe Lightweight Directory Access Protocol.\n\n80\n00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:49.058\nIt's an open standard, there's a ton\nof people out there that support it.\n\n81\n00:03:49.058 --> 00:03:53.670\nAnd it is just a central repository for\nuser accounts and groups, right?\n\n82\n00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.850\nWe can group the users together.\n\n83\n00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:58.440\nApple took OpenLDAP and\n\n84\n00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.710\nmodified it a little bit to create\ntheir Open Directory Server.\n\n85\n00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:05.730\nAnd so if I want a quick and\neasy directory server, I can whip this up.\n\n86\n00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:08.750\nIt's pretty easy to start it here,\nI'll run through it real quick.\n\n87\n00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.450\nIf I choose Open Directory and just hit\nthe ON button, it’s gonna run me through\n\n88\n00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:16.710\na little wizard where I just need to tell\nit that I’m creating a new Open Directory\n\n89\n00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:20.290\ndomain, and then give it a little\ninformation about myself.\n\n90\n00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:21.780\nI need to have an administrator account.\n\n91\n00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:23.485\nSo it’s gonna create one called diradmin.\n\n92\n00:04:23.485 --> 00:04:25.860\nYou can change it to\nsomething else if you want.\n\n93\n00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.820\nI need to punch in a password for it.\n\n94\n00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:34.070\nAnd the challenge here is typing the same\npassword twice, and that's pretty much it.\n\n95\n00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:36.880\nIt's gonna ask me for\na company name eventually.\n\n96\n00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.460\nAnd so on the next screen,\nthere it is, Organization Name, right?\n\n97\n00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:44.603\nI'll say that I'm ITProTV, and\nan email address for the administrator.\n\n98\n00:04:44.603 --> 00:04:47.510\nSo maybe that's me,\nI'll just do don@itpro.tv.\n\n99\n00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:50.540\nAll right, so\nnow it's got all the information it needs.\n\n100\n00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:51.860\nAnd we can go ahead and get that set up.\n\n101\n00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:54.880\nAnd it's gonna create\nthat directory server.\n\n102\n00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:57.640\nNow, what it's doing is\nit's building a database.\n\n103\n00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:59.990\nAnd in that database,\nit's gonna have user accounts.\n\n104\n00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:04.420\nBut by default, it's gonna have one\naccount, diradmin, and that's it.\n\n105\n00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:06.780\nAnd that's not gonna work on\nany other computer out there.\n\n106\n00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:08.400\nIt's just here in the database.\n\n107\n00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:14.630\nSo what I have to do next is get my client\nto know to look to this directory, right?\n\n108\n00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:18.050\nNow the Open Directory is open, right?\n\n109\n00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:22.638\nApple's pretty freely documented,\nor whatever.\n\n110\n00:05:22.638 --> 00:05:25.530\nThey tell people how it works, so\nother people can integrate with it.\n\n111\n00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:27.220\nBut it's really designed for Macs.\n\n112\n00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:30.030\nAnd if I want my Mac to be able\nto connect to this directory,\n\n113\n00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:32.820\nI just need to do what's\ncalled binding the client.\n\n114\n00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:36.340\nWhen you bind the client that tells it,\nhey, you don't just have local user\n\n115\n00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:40.089\naccounts, you also have accounts stored\nout in this directory somewhere else.\n\n116\n00:05:40.089 --> 00:05:42.090\nAnd you can go and access that.\n\n117\n00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:45.960\nNow Apple's Open Directory,\nit's pretty easy to use.\n\n118\n00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:47.470\nYou saw it, I turned it on there.\n\n119\n00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:49.450\nIt just took a matter of seconds.\n\n120\n00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:53.820\nAnd now what I can do is I can go up here\nto my Accounts, to my Users and Groups.\n\n121\n00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:55.900\nAnd I can start creating accounts.\n\n122\n00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:58.830\nSo if I go under Users, let's say\nI want Daniel to have an account.\n\n123\n00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:01.211\nSo I can come in here and\nI can just hit my little plus sign.\n\n124\n00:06:01.211 --> 00:06:03.280\nAnd I'm gonna add an account.\n\n125\n00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:07.220\nAnd when I do that, notice how I can\npick between a local directory and\n\n126\n00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:08.730\na network directory.\n\n127\n00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:13.850\nLocal is just on this Mac, but network,\nthat's gonna be part of Open Directory.\n\n128\n00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:15.870\n>> So you have to be really\ncareful when you do this, right,\n\n129\n00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:19.595\nbecause if you leave it on local\nthen it's just gonna be for the Mac.\n\n130\n00:06:19.595 --> 00:06:21.336\nAnd it's not gonna work\nthroughout your Open Directory,\n\n131\n00:06:21.336 --> 00:06:22.375\nwhich is kinda what we're doing.\n\n132\n00:06:22.375 --> 00:06:23.235\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, and then you go\n\n133\n00:06:23.235 --> 00:06:25.535\nto other machines and you try and\nlog in and it doesn't work.\n\n134\n00:06:25.535 --> 00:06:27.075\nYeah, and\nthere's no easy way to change it.\n\n135\n00:06:27.075 --> 00:06:28.885\nYou have to delete the user and all that.\n\n136\n00:06:28.885 --> 00:06:31.455\nSo you definitely want to\nmake sure you get that right.\n\n137\n00:06:31.455 --> 00:06:34.100\nNow, when your logging into\nApple's Open Directory,\n\n138\n00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:36.410\nthere's two different formats for\nyour username.\n\n139\n00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:38.930\nThere's the full name and\nthere's the account name.\n\n140\n00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:42.340\nSo for the full name I might\nput Daniel Lowrie, right?\n\n141\n00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:47.240\nAnd then for the account name I might\ndo something like dlowrie, right, or\n\n142\n00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:50.030\nsomething, whatever variation it\nis you wanna use for usernames.\n\n143\n00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:52.810\nNow when he goes to login,\nhe can login with either of these.\n\n144\n00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:53.850\nEither one works, right?\n\n145\n00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:55.720\nOne's a little more user\nfriendly than the other.\n\n146\n00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:58.230\nBut be aware that there\nare two different formats for\n\n147\n00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:01.070\nthe usernames in the Open Directory.\n\n148\n00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:03.630\nThe rest of the data is pretty much\noptional except for the passwords.\n\n149\n00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:05.705\nSo I'm gonna punch in a password for\n\n150\n00:07:05.705 --> 00:07:09.970\nhim, kind of have to have that,\nand then we're pretty good to go.\n\n151\n00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:13.870\nThe only other thing that's really\nnecessary to change is the Home Folder.\n\n152\n00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:15.670\nThe Home Folder defaults to Local Only.\n\n153\n00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:18.350\nAnd what that means is that he's\ngonna have a user account here\n\n154\n00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:19.910\nthat is going to have a Home Folder.\n\n155\n00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:23.370\nSo if he were to log in on this server,\nhe'd have access.\n\n156\n00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:28.700\nBut I can actually change that to say,\nNone- Services Only.\n\n157\n00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:33.023\nAnd what that means is that Daniel will\nbe able to log in to the Open Directory.\n\n158\n00:07:33.023 --> 00:07:36.059\nHe'll be able to log in to other\nservices inside of the server app, but\n\n159\n00:07:36.059 --> 00:07:37.870\nhe won't be able to log into this server.\n\n160\n00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:39.542\nHe can't sit down in front of it and\nlog in.\n\n161\n00:07:39.542 --> 00:07:41.370\nAnd for a regular user,\nthat's typically what you want.\n\n162\n00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:45.000\nYou don't want them logging into your\nservers, so we can choose that if we want.\n\n163\n00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.170\nI'll leave them at Local Only cuz maybe\nI'll want to make an admin later on,\n\n164\n00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:50.140\nall right,\nwhich you've got that option right here,\n\n165\n00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:51.800\nAllow user to administer this server.\n\n166\n00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:53.829\nI'm not gonna do that, sorry Daniel.\n\n167\n00:07:53.829 --> 00:07:56.033\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So I'm gonna get that set, and\n\n168\n00:07:56.033 --> 00:07:56.708\nI'll create it.\n\n169\n00:07:56.708 --> 00:07:59.463\nAnd now I've got a network account for\nhim, right?\n\n170\n00:07:59.463 --> 00:08:01.839\nAnd I mean, it really didn't\ntake me very long to do that,\n\n171\n00:08:01.839 --> 00:08:03.254\nsetting this up very, very easy.\n\n172\n00:08:03.254 --> 00:08:05.631\nI start creating accounts,\nI'm in business.\n\n173\n00:08:05.631 --> 00:08:09.004\nBut my clients don't know\nto look to this server.\n\n174\n00:08:09.004 --> 00:08:11.860\nSo I've gotta go to my client and\nI've gotta tell that.\n\n175\n00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:16.036\nSee how looking at this client,\nDaniel doesn't show up in the list at all.\n\n176\n00:08:16.036 --> 00:08:18.289\nHe's not in there,\nwe've gotta tell it to look that way.\n\n177\n00:08:18.289 --> 00:08:22.248\nAnd if you look you've got this\nLogin Options button you can hit.\n\n178\n00:08:22.248 --> 00:08:25.474\nAnd right here Network Account Server.\n\n179\n00:08:25.474 --> 00:08:28.839\nThat's where we can point it to a domain\ncontroller to to be able to authenticate\n\n180\n00:08:28.839 --> 00:08:31.730\nand get access if we've\ngot a network server.\n\n181\n00:08:31.730 --> 00:08:36.093\nSo I'm gonna unlock here,\nso I can change that.\n\n182\n00:08:36.093 --> 00:08:39.088\nAnd I'm gonna hit Join\nto connect this one up.\n\n183\n00:08:39.088 --> 00:08:41.387\nAnd when you join, you just need\nto give it the name of the server.\n\n184\n00:08:41.387 --> 00:08:45.554\nSo my server was called osx-server01.\n\n185\n00:08:45.554 --> 00:08:48.676\nAnd actually,\nI think to need to add .local to the end.\n\n186\n00:08:48.676 --> 00:08:50.233\nAnd it needs the fully qualified name.\n\n187\n00:08:50.233 --> 00:08:54.325\nSo I’m gonna put that name in there,\nand I’ll go ahead and hit OK on that.\n\n188\n00:08:54.325 --> 00:08:56.455\nAnd it’s gonna reach out and\nfind the server.\n\n189\n00:08:56.455 --> 00:08:59.403\nAnd I need to trust the certificates on\nit which I didn’t create certificates, so\n\n190\n00:08:59.403 --> 00:09:01.090\nthey’re gonna be self signed certificates.\n\n191\n00:09:01.090 --> 00:09:02.760\nSo I’ll probably get two trust windows.\n\n192\n00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:03.883\nYeah, there’s the other one.\n\n193\n00:09:03.883 --> 00:09:07.862\nCuz it's not truly secure, cuz I don't\nnecessarily trust the certificates.\n\n194\n00:09:07.862 --> 00:09:10.161\nSo I continue past that, and there we go.\n\n195\n00:09:10.161 --> 00:09:13.640\nNow that it's done, see how I've\ngot that little green light there.\n\n196\n00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:16.008\nAnd that's gonna change\nthe behavior of this Mac.\n\n197\n00:09:16.008 --> 00:09:21.290\nNow I can log out and when I go to Login,\nI'm gonna have a new option.\n\n198\n00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:25.150\nNow normally, I would just see an icon for\nDon Pezet and that would be it.\n\n199\n00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:27.410\nBut now I see this new icon right here,\nOther.\n\n200\n00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:31.552\nWhen we connect to a directory server,\nyou can have a 1,000, 10,000,\n\n201\n00:09:31.552 --> 00:09:33.350\na 100,000 user accounts.\n\n202\n00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:36.710\nSo I don't want an icon for every\nsingle user, that would be ridiculous.\n\n203\n00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:41.540\nSo you have your local users and\nthen you have Other, for network accounts.\n\n204\n00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:43.410\nAnd when you choose that,\nyou can type in your Name.\n\n205\n00:09:43.410 --> 00:09:46.680\nIn here, I could type in dlowrie or\n\n206\n00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:51.720\nI can type in Daniel Lowrie,\nwhich ever format it was that I wanted.\n\n207\n00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:53.240\nThere were the two different formats.\n\n208\n00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:57.230\nThen I can punch in his password and\ntry and login.\n\n209\n00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:01.190\nSo I'm gonna try to login, and what's\nhappening in the background is my client\n\n210\n00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:03.050\nis reaching up to that server and\nsaying hey,\n\n211\n00:10:03.050 --> 00:10:07.770\nsomebody just typed in this username and\nthis password, I don't have that account.\n\n212\n00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:08.990\nIs it okay?\n\n213\n00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:11.660\nAnd the directory server will look at\nit and say, yeah, yeah, that's good.\n\n214\n00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:12.550\nThose match up perfect.\n\n215\n00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:14.820\nLet's let them login and here we are.\n\n216\n00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:18.210\nI'm logged in as Daniel Lowrie even\nthough he doesn't have an account on\n\n217\n00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:18.730\nthis machine.\n\n218\n00:10:18.730 --> 00:10:22.769\nWell even though he didn't have\nan account, because he does now.\n\n219\n00:10:22.769 --> 00:10:25.850\nNow, if I go into my\nSystem Preferences and\n\n220\n00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:30.780\nI go into Users & Groups,\nwhen I look, there is Daniel Lowrie.\n\n221\n00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:34.070\nHe's got an account, but\nsee how it shows Network.\n\n222\n00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:35.014\nIt's a Network account.\n\n223\n00:10:35.014 --> 00:10:36.788\nIt's not a local account.\n\n224\n00:10:36.788 --> 00:10:40.820\nAnd if he Logs Out,\nI'll just log him out real quick.\n\n225\n00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:43.160\nAnd then I'll log back in as myself.\n\n226\n00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:45.878\nI'll see that information has\nto stay there because it's\n\n227\n00:10:45.878 --> 00:10:47.439\ngotta have a home folder for him.\n\n228\n00:10:47.439 --> 00:10:49.031\nSo he's able to store his documents and\n\n229\n00:10:49.031 --> 00:10:52.360\nwe don't want all the documents\ndisappearing just because he logged out.\n\n230\n00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:54.400\nSo that data actually stays.\n\n231\n00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:57.880\nSo log back in as me,\nI can come in here and\n\n232\n00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:00.630\nI can go back into those Users & Groups.\n\n233\n00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:03.420\nAnd Daniel Lowrie's gone.\n\n234\n00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:04.510\nHe's gone aw, crap.\n\n235\n00:11:04.510 --> 00:11:05.665\nWe just lost all your data, Daniel.\n\n236\n00:11:05.665 --> 00:11:06.664\nSorry.\n\n237\n00:11:06.664 --> 00:11:07.302\n>> That's okay.\n\n238\n00:11:07.302 --> 00:11:08.985\n>> You like typing, right?\n\n239\n00:11:08.985 --> 00:11:10.344\nIt's not actually gone.\n\n240\n00:11:10.344 --> 00:11:11.750\nIt's just hidden from me.\n\n241\n00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:14.526\nIt's hidden from me, cuz I'm not\nlogged in with the directory account.\n\n242\n00:11:14.526 --> 00:11:17.479\nI logged in with my local account,\nbut that data is still there.\n\n243\n00:11:17.479 --> 00:11:19.126\nHe still has the home folder.\n\n244\n00:11:19.126 --> 00:11:21.590\nSo if he logs back in,\nthe data will reappear, but\n\n245\n00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:23.410\nthose network accounts do stay.\n\n246\n00:11:23.410 --> 00:11:24.310\n>> So Don really quickly.\n\n247\n00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:27.226\nWould it be improper to say that I now,\n\n248\n00:11:27.226 --> 00:11:30.883\nI don't have an account\non the machine per say?\n\n249\n00:11:30.883 --> 00:11:33.437\nI have an account in the open directory?\n\n250\n00:11:33.437 --> 00:11:34.732\n>> That's correct, yes.\n\n251\n00:11:34.732 --> 00:11:35.568\nThat's absolutely true.\n\n252\n00:11:35.568 --> 00:11:38.665\nYou are not in the user account\ndatabase for this machine.\n\n253\n00:11:38.665 --> 00:11:41.418\nAnd in fact, if I were to unbind\nthis machine from the directory,\n\n254\n00:11:41.418 --> 00:11:43.133\nyou wouldn't be able to login anymore.\n\n255\n00:11:43.133 --> 00:11:44.629\nYour account doesn't truly exist here,\n\n256\n00:11:44.629 --> 00:11:46.472\nthat's why it just\ndisappeared from that screen.\n\n257\n00:11:46.472 --> 00:11:48.608\nSo in fact, if we wanna unbind,\nthat's pretty easy.\n\n258\n00:11:48.608 --> 00:11:50.964\nI can just jump in on my\nSystem Preferences and\n\n259\n00:11:50.964 --> 00:11:55.242\nI can go back into Users & Groups and I'm\ngonna unbind it from that directory which\n\n260\n00:11:55.242 --> 00:11:59.750\nwill stop Daniel from being able to\nlog in, cuz he'll no longer be bound.\n\n261\n00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:01.210\nSo I'll just come in here,\nand I'll edit that.\n\n262\n00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:04.130\nAnd I'm gonna take that directory server.\n\n263\n00:12:04.130 --> 00:12:07.237\nAnd I'll just remove it and\nI'll stop using that server, and\n\n264\n00:12:07.237 --> 00:12:08.986\nnow it's not being done any more.\n\n265\n00:12:08.986 --> 00:12:12.370\nSo that's a quick overview of\ndirectory servers and how they work.\n\n266\n00:12:12.370 --> 00:12:16.100\nAnd that centralized management that we\ngot, the one place for our user accounts,\n\n267\n00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:17.510\nthat really helps out.\n\n268\n00:12:17.510 --> 00:12:19.904\nBut the title of this series\nis Mac Integration Base.\n\n269\n00:12:19.904 --> 00:12:22.040\nSo I'm supposed to be\nintegrating with other systems.\n\n270\n00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:24.113\nI just showed a Mac logging\ninto Apple's Open Directory,\n\n271\n00:12:24.113 --> 00:12:25.732\nthere's not a whole lot\nto integrate there.\n\n272\n00:12:25.732 --> 00:12:26.953\n>> Kind of threw yourself a softball, Don.\n\n273\n00:12:26.953 --> 00:12:27.487\n>> I know, I did.\n\n274\n00:12:27.487 --> 00:12:30.240\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I like to take the low hanging fruit.\n\n275\n00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:32.060\nSo let's kick this up a notch.\n\n276\n00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:34.990\nLet's say that, that central user\ndatabase is not Open Directory.\n\n277\n00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:37.976\nWe'll say that it's\nMicrosoft's Active Directory.\n\n278\n00:12:37.976 --> 00:12:40.650\nI have an Active Directory Server\nparked over here.\n\n279\n00:12:40.650 --> 00:12:44.173\nSo this is a Windows Server 2012 machine.\n\n280\n00:12:44.173 --> 00:12:47.910\nSo I got Windows Server 2012 here and\nI've got an active directory in place.\n\n281\n00:12:47.910 --> 00:12:51.645\nAnd let's just say, I go in here and\nI'm gonna create a new user account.\n\n282\n00:12:51.645 --> 00:12:56.620\nWe'll create an account for,\nlet's do Titus, our producer.\n\n283\n00:12:56.620 --> 00:12:59.523\nSo we're gonna throw Titus in here.\n\n284\n00:12:59.523 --> 00:13:00.423\nThis is where he starts getting nervous,\n\n285\n00:13:00.423 --> 00:13:01.011\ngives you-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n286\n00:13:01.011 --> 00:13:02.515\n>> The look off camera like\n\n287\n00:13:02.515 --> 00:13:03.461\ndon't you do it.\n\n288\n00:13:03.461 --> 00:13:05.249\nI'm gonna create an account for\nTitus though.\n\n289\n00:13:05.249 --> 00:13:08.174\nAnd when I create the account for Titus,\nthere's a few things that are going on\n\n290\n00:13:08.174 --> 00:13:10.600\nhere that's a lot different\nthat then Mac world.\n\n291\n00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:13.730\nIn the Mac Open Directory, remember\nhow I said there were two formats for\n\n292\n00:13:13.730 --> 00:13:14.640\nthe user name?\n\n293\n00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:17.405\nThere was Daniel's full name,\nDaniel Lowrie.\n\n294\n00:13:17.405 --> 00:13:20.770\nAnd then there was the account name\nwhich I made was just dlowrie.\n\n295\n00:13:20.770 --> 00:13:25.330\nWell in the Windows world,\nthere's actually three different forms for\n\n296\n00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:27.130\nthe user account name.\n\n297\n00:13:27.130 --> 00:13:28.040\nAnd the full name,\n\n298\n00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:31.060\nwhat works in the Mac world,\nthat doesn't work in the Windows world.\n\n299\n00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:32.190\nSo full name doesn't count.\n\n300\n00:13:32.190 --> 00:13:33.620\nSo that's not one of them.\n\n301\n00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:37.450\nIn the Windows world,\nthese two are the predominant ones.\n\n302\n00:13:37.450 --> 00:13:39.380\nSo you actually have a User Login Name.\n\n303\n00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:41.562\nSo in this case, I'm just making it titus.\n\n304\n00:13:41.562 --> 00:13:43.222\nSo titus, that's his user name.\n\n305\n00:13:43.222 --> 00:13:48.067\nHe can log in with that or\nhe can login with what's called the user\n\n306\n00:13:48.067 --> 00:13:52.934\nprincipal name which for\nhim would be titus@lab.itpro.tv.\n\n307\n00:13:52.934 --> 00:13:56.268\nThe name of this directory\nis lab.itpro.tv, and so\n\n308\n00:13:56.268 --> 00:13:58.649\nit's the username @ and the domain.\n\n309\n00:13:58.649 --> 00:14:00.474\nSo that's a second form, and\n\n310\n00:14:00.474 --> 00:14:03.913\nthen the third form is what's\ncalled the NetBIOS name.\n\n311\n00:14:03.913 --> 00:14:08.638\nAnd it's a throwback to pre-Windows 2000,\nfrom a long time ago, but\n\n312\n00:14:08.638 --> 00:14:10.589\nMicrosoft still supports it.\n\n313\n00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:16.557\nAnd so in my case, it would be LAB\\titus.\n\n314\n00:14:16.557 --> 00:14:19.290\nSo three different forms of that username.\n\n315\n00:14:19.290 --> 00:14:20.710\nWhy do I care about that?\n\n316\n00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:23.650\nBecause with a Mac I can login\nwith any of those three.\n\n317\n00:14:23.650 --> 00:14:25.000\nIt's up to me, whichever one's easier.\n\n318\n00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.220\nNow obviously, it would be easiest to\nlogin as titus and be done with it.\n\n319\n00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:31.480\nBut if I wanted to login with one of\nthese other names, I certainly could and\n\n320\n00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:32.730\nthat would be just fine.\n\n321\n00:14:32.730 --> 00:14:36.063\nAnd Microsoft recommends\nthat you login with the UPN,\n\n322\n00:14:36.063 --> 00:14:39.770\nthe full user principal name,\nso titus@lab.itpro.tv.\n\n323\n00:14:39.770 --> 00:14:41.949\nSo that's usually what we're gonna want.\n\n324\n00:14:41.949 --> 00:14:43.600\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\njust finish this wizard.\n\n325\n00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:48.398\nI need to give him a password,\nso I will do that and\n\n326\n00:14:48.398 --> 00:14:52.620\nI'll set his password to not expire on me.\n\n327\n00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:53.687\nI will try to do that.\n\n328\n00:14:53.687 --> 00:14:54.860\nThere we go.\n\n329\n00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:56.694\nAnd I'll finish that up.\n\n330\n00:14:56.694 --> 00:15:01.290\nSo now, Titus has an account right\nhere in the Active Directory.\n\n331\n00:15:01.290 --> 00:15:03.120\nHe does not have an account on that Mac.\n\n332\n00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:06.938\nBut he has an account right\nhere in the Active Directory.\n\n333\n00:15:06.938 --> 00:15:09.725\nAnd in the Active Directory,\nif I go to computers.\n\n334\n00:15:09.725 --> 00:15:11.407\nLet's say,\nthere's no computers in the list.\n\n335\n00:15:11.407 --> 00:15:15.414\nSo there's no computers joined to this\ndomain, his Mac has no way of seeing this,\n\n336\n00:15:15.414 --> 00:15:17.270\nit doesn't know it.\n\n337\n00:15:17.270 --> 00:15:22.860\nBut I combined his client with this Active\nDirectory, and now he'll be able to login.\n\n338\n00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:24.563\nSo let's see that.\n\n339\n00:15:24.563 --> 00:15:26.440\nSo I'm gonna jump back over to that Mac.\n\n340\n00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:29.718\nHere's the Mac that I had bound to\nOpen Directory just a few moments ago.\n\n341\n00:15:29.718 --> 00:15:35.900\nAnd if I go up into my System Preferences\nand actually, I'm about to forget a step.\n\n342\n00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:38.661\nIt wouldn't have worked.\n\n343\n00:15:38.661 --> 00:15:40.650\nWith Open Directory.\n\n344\n00:15:40.650 --> 00:15:44.910\nApple uses the Bonjour protocol and a few\nother protocols to make it where you can\n\n345\n00:15:44.910 --> 00:15:48.080\nfind it on the network, easy as pie,\nno big deal, you'll find it.\n\n346\n00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:50.380\nIt'll work, you saw how simple it was.\n\n347\n00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:54.890\nMicrosoft uses DNS,\nuses the domain naming system to do it.\n\n348\n00:15:54.890 --> 00:15:59.421\nAnd if I have my DNS server set wrong,\nI might not find the Active Directory.\n\n349\n00:15:59.421 --> 00:16:02.172\nAnd right now,\nI've got my DNS server set wrong.\n\n350\n00:16:02.172 --> 00:16:04.580\nIf I wanna bind to an Active Directory.\n\n351\n00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:09.494\nI've got to be able to do a lookup to\nfind the name of the active directory,\n\n352\n00:16:09.494 --> 00:16:12.510\nand right now, I'm not set to do that.\n\n353\n00:16:12.510 --> 00:16:15.650\nSo, what I need to do is\nchange my DNS servers\n\n354\n00:16:15.650 --> 00:16:18.700\nto point to that domain controller,\nor otherwise I'm not gonna find it.\n\n355\n00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:21.260\nAnd here in my lab, I'm going to\npoint to the domain controller.\n\n356\n00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:26.610\nIn your environment, it's whatever DNS\nserver stores your active directory zones.\n\n357\n00:16:26.610 --> 00:16:27.550\nIf you're not familiar with that,\n\n358\n00:16:27.550 --> 00:16:30.310\nlet me just show you real\nquick on my domain controller.\n\n359\n00:16:31.690 --> 00:16:37.435\nIf I go into the server manager and\ngo to tools and DNS.\n\n360\n00:16:37.435 --> 00:16:41.935\nRight here is my DNS Manager and inside of\nDNS, if I go into my Forward Lookup Zones.\n\n361\n00:16:41.935 --> 00:16:45.270\nRemember, I said my environment\nwas called lab.itpro.tv?\n\n362\n00:16:45.270 --> 00:16:46.517\nHere it is.\n\n363\n00:16:46.517 --> 00:16:51.309\nAnd see all these little folders,\n_msdcs, _sites, _tcp.\n\n364\n00:16:51.309 --> 00:16:55.220\nThose are all folders that help\nme find the active directory.\n\n365\n00:16:55.220 --> 00:16:59.060\nSo as long as I can see these records,\nI can find the active directory.\n\n366\n00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:02.518\nBut I'm only gonna see this records\nif I look at this DNS server, right?\n\n367\n00:17:02.518 --> 00:17:05.486\nWhich is called WIN-SERVER01 and\n\n368\n00:17:05.486 --> 00:17:10.184\nit's got an IP address of 192.168.0.200.\n\n369\n00:17:10.184 --> 00:17:14.300\nSo I need to change my client\nto use that DNS server, okay.\n\n370\n00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:16.684\nSo I'm gonna just do a couple\nof quick checks here.\n\n371\n00:17:16.684 --> 00:17:19.934\nLet me get in to my terminal.\n\n372\n00:17:19.934 --> 00:17:23.909\nAnd right now, if I do an NS lookup for\n\n373\n00:17:23.909 --> 00:17:29.184\nwin-server01.lab.itpro.tv., okay.\n\n374\n00:17:29.184 --> 00:17:30.900\nOkay, I'm gonna do a look up for that.\n\n375\n00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:34.920\nAnd it's gonna fail, because I'm not\nusing that server for DNS, and so\n\n376\n00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:36.390\nI'm not able to do the lookup, right?\n\n377\n00:17:36.390 --> 00:17:40.560\nSo I'm gonna try and find that server,\nit's gonna fail and I'll get nothing back.\n\n378\n00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:42.100\nApparently it's just\ngonna sit there forever.\n\n379\n00:17:43.230 --> 00:17:44.370\nAll right, well,\nI don't have to wait on it.\n\n380\n00:17:44.370 --> 00:17:45.010\nThere it goes.\n\n381\n00:17:45.010 --> 00:17:46.920\nConnection timed out,\nno servers could be reached.\n\n382\n00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:48.860\nDNS is not working for me, right?\n\n383\n00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:51.990\nSo, I'm gonna go into my settings and\nI'm gonna go into network.\n\n384\n00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:55.050\nAnd, I'll take my connection and\nI'm gonna go into advanced.\n\n385\n00:17:56.600 --> 00:18:00.360\nAnd, I'm using DACP but\nI can still override the DNS settings for\n\n386\n00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:02.820\nit, and that's exactly what I want to do.\n\n387\n00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:04.379\nSo, I'm gonna override those.\n\n388\n00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:09.730\nAnd I'm gonna point it to\nthat DNS server that has\n\n389\n00:18:09.730 --> 00:18:12.820\nthe active directory information so\nthat I'll be able to find it, okay?\n\n390\n00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:16.820\nSo I'm gonna go put that in place,\nlet me apply that, you know what?\n\n391\n00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:19.870\nAnother thing that is useful, you don't\nhave to do this, but it can help,\n\n392\n00:18:19.870 --> 00:18:24.000\nis in DNS you have these Search Domains,\nand my default is just localdomain.\n\n393\n00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.602\nIt's a good idea to add the name\nof your active directory domain.\n\n394\n00:18:26.602 --> 00:18:31.678\nYou don't have to do this, but it actually\ndoes help, because then I can do single\n\n395\n00:18:31.678 --> 00:18:36.476\nname look-ups like, I do a search for\nwin-server01.lab.itpro.tv.\n\n396\n00:18:36.476 --> 00:18:39.048\nBut if I had the search\ndomain defined like this,\n\n397\n00:18:39.048 --> 00:18:43.150\nI could have just done a search for\nwin-server01, and been done, right?\n\n398\n00:18:43.150 --> 00:18:45.120\nSo it makes life a little bit easier for\nus.\n\n399\n00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:47.720\nNot required, but definitely nice.\n\n400\n00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:51.680\nAll right, so I'm gonna go and apply that,\nso that's gonna get put in place and\n\n401\n00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:54.550\nnow I'm gonna try this look up again.\n\n402\n00:18:54.550 --> 00:18:57.810\nSo I'm gonna try and look that up and\nthis time I get a response, right?\n\n403\n00:18:57.810 --> 00:18:59.620\nNow, I'm gonna be able to\nfind my active directory.\n\n404\n00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:04.550\nIn fact, if I do a search for\nwin-server01, that works too, so\n\n405\n00:19:04.550 --> 00:19:06.530\nnow I can do single name lookups.\n\n406\n00:19:06.530 --> 00:19:07.370\nThat helps out.\n\n407\n00:19:07.370 --> 00:19:09.830\nIn Apple world we have Bonjour, so\nwe don't have to worry about this, but\n\n408\n00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:11.700\nin the Windows world we\nhave to have a name server.\n\n409\n00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:13.060\n>> It's all about integration, right Don?\n\n410\n00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:13.950\n>> That's it, and\n\n411\n00:19:13.950 --> 00:19:17.517\nthis is something you will absolutely\nbump into in the real world.\n\n412\n00:19:17.517 --> 00:19:19.360\nAll right, so\nnow let's go see if we can bind.\n\n413\n00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:22.930\nWe've done all this great work,\nlet's see if it actually works.\n\n414\n00:19:22.930 --> 00:19:26.260\nSo I’m gonna go back into\nmy system preferences and\n\n415\n00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:28.780\nwe're just gonna jump into users and\ngroups.\n\n416\n00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:32.590\nAnd my log in options, I’m gonna\nunlock that just like we did before.\n\n417\n00:19:32.590 --> 00:19:35.750\nSo far I’m doing exactly the same\nthing I did with open directory.\n\n418\n00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:38.720\nI’m gonna go to the network\naccount server, I’ll hit join.\n\n419\n00:19:39.850 --> 00:19:41.450\nAnd, I'm gonna put in the server.\n\n420\n00:19:41.450 --> 00:19:44.560\nNow, here's where it gets a little bit\nweird, cuz notice down here it says, you\n\n421\n00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:50.580\ncan enter the address of an open directory\nserver or an active directory domain.\n\n422\n00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:52.500\nNow, notice the verbiage there.\n\n423\n00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:55.100\nIt's not saying an active\ndirectory server,\n\n424\n00:19:55.100 --> 00:19:57.320\nit's saying an active directory domain.\n\n425\n00:19:57.320 --> 00:20:00.840\nSo, my server is called win-server01.\n\n426\n00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:02.940\nBut what's my active directory called?\n\n427\n00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:09.430\nWell, remember when I created\nTitus's account, way back here,\n\n428\n00:20:09.430 --> 00:20:13.728\nwhen I created Titus's account I\nsaw that User Principal Name and\n\n429\n00:20:13.728 --> 00:20:17.040\nI saw lab.itpro.tv.\n\n430\n00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:18.684\nThat's my domain name, right?\n\n431\n00:20:18.684 --> 00:20:20.000\nI actually didn't have to\nbrowse all the way in here.\n\n432\n00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.459\nI could have seen it just as\nclearly right here in the active\n\n433\n00:20:24.459 --> 00:20:27.380\ndirectory using computers utility.\n\n434\n00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:28.930\nIt's lab.itpro.tv.\n\n435\n00:20:28.930 --> 00:20:33.540\nSo that's what I need to type here,\nnot the server name, but the domain name.\n\n436\n00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:37.434\nSo lab.itpro.tv,\nI'm just gonna punch that in.\n\n437\n00:20:37.434 --> 00:20:41.184\nOops, I hit, there we go.\n\n438\n00:20:41.184 --> 00:20:42.978\nAll right, sorry, I hit enter by accident.\n\n439\n00:20:42.978 --> 00:20:46.452\nAnd so when I hit enter, it went ahead and\ndid a look up for lab.itpro.tv and\n\n440\n00:20:46.452 --> 00:20:47.059\nit found it.\n\n441\n00:20:47.059 --> 00:20:50.993\nAnd it found it and it said,\nokay, we're gonna connect you but\n\n442\n00:20:50.993 --> 00:20:55.440\nyou need a computer ID and you need\na user name and a password to join it.\n\n443\n00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:56.710\nSo I can give it a computer ID.\n\n444\n00:20:56.710 --> 00:20:58.234\nNow's it's gonna call it dons-mac.\n\n445\n00:20:59.270 --> 00:21:00.184\nI'll call it something different.\n\n446\n00:21:00.184 --> 00:21:04.601\nSo maybe I'll make this like,\nOSX-CLIENT01.\n\n447\n00:21:04.601 --> 00:21:06.220\nThere we go, all right.\n\n448\n00:21:06.220 --> 00:21:07.730\nSo I've got that one in there.\n\n449\n00:21:07.730 --> 00:21:11.030\nIt's happy, and now I can type in my\nadministrator account that's allowed to\n\n450\n00:21:11.030 --> 00:21:12.500\njoin computers to the domain.\n\n451\n00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:15.110\nYou need to have an account on\nthe domain already to do this.\n\n452\n00:21:15.110 --> 00:21:18.060\nSo I've got an administrator\naccount I can use.\n\n453\n00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:22.180\nAssuming I remember its password,\nand we'll say okay to that.\n\n454\n00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:26.200\nSo now, it's joining me to that domain.\n\n455\n00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:28.886\nRight?\nIt's connecting me to the lab.itpro.tv\n\n456\n00:21:28.886 --> 00:21:30.040\ndomain.\n\n457\n00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:33.690\nAnd, it's getting active directory\nsettings, it's getting things set up.\n\n458\n00:21:33.690 --> 00:21:36.200\nAnd there we go, now I'm connected, right?\n\n459\n00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:39.050\nNow, I changed the name of\nmy system when I joined.\n\n460\n00:21:39.050 --> 00:21:41.934\nAnd it's joined, see how it says\nnetwork account server LAB?\n\n461\n00:21:41.934 --> 00:21:42.435\nRight?\n\n462\n00:21:42.435 --> 00:21:43.840\nSo it found that server and\nit connected to it.\n\n463\n00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:46.010\nI got a green dot, so I am joined.\n\n464\n00:21:46.010 --> 00:21:48.360\nI probably wanna update\nmy host name though.\n\n465\n00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:50.870\nSo in system preference,\nI'm gonna go to sharing and\n\n466\n00:21:50.870 --> 00:21:52.535\nsee how my computer name is Don's Mac.\n\n467\n00:21:52.535 --> 00:21:54.035\nThat's where that came from.\n\n468\n00:21:54.035 --> 00:21:59.195\nAnd I'm just gonna change that cuz I\nwant it to be OSX-CLIENT01, right?\n\n469\n00:21:59.195 --> 00:22:02.195\nAgain, this is another one of those\nthings that I don't have to do this.\n\n470\n00:22:02.195 --> 00:22:05.005\nI'm just doing it for convenience sake.\n\n471\n00:22:05.005 --> 00:22:06.605\nHaving multiple host names for\n\n472\n00:22:06.605 --> 00:22:09.775\na Mac gets really confusing when\nyou're sifting through logs or\n\n473\n00:22:09.775 --> 00:22:12.555\ntroubleshooting a network, and a system\nhas two names, it's a pain in the butt.\n\n474\n00:22:12.555 --> 00:22:14.585\nSo I like to try and\nkeep things consistent, so\n\n475\n00:22:14.585 --> 00:22:15.346\nthat's why I'm renaming that.\n\n476\n00:22:16.450 --> 00:22:17.190\nAll right.\n\n477\n00:22:17.190 --> 00:22:21.020\nWhen that's done though, I'm now bound\nto the Microsoft active directory and\n\n478\n00:22:21.020 --> 00:22:24.350\nit really wasn't much different than\nwhen I bound to open directory.\n\n479\n00:22:24.350 --> 00:22:27.230\nIt just asked me for a username and\npassword and that was that but otherwise,\n\n480\n00:22:27.230 --> 00:22:28.680\nit was pretty much the same process.\n\n481\n00:22:29.770 --> 00:22:32.166\n>> So Don, now that we have\nthe bindings put together,\n\n482\n00:22:32.166 --> 00:22:35.543\nwe should be able to do just like what\nwe did before, I'm able to log out and\n\n483\n00:22:35.543 --> 00:22:37.727\nthen log in using our new credentials,\nright?\n\n484\n00:22:37.727 --> 00:22:38.560\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n485\n00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:43.000\nSo I'm gonna log out as me and\nI'm gonna log in as Titus, right?\n\n486\n00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.605\nNow, I've never created an account for\nTitus here on this machine, but\n\n487\n00:22:45.605 --> 00:22:47.228\nI'll go to other, and\nnow it's gonna ask for\n\n488\n00:22:47.228 --> 00:22:49.642\nthat name, and remember there\nwere the three different formats.\n\n489\n00:22:49.642 --> 00:22:52.434\nSo I could log in as Titus, right?\n\n490\n00:22:52.434 --> 00:22:57.422\nOr I can log as titus@lab.itpro.tv, which\nis the one that Microsoft recommends,\n\n491\n00:22:57.422 --> 00:23:00.410\ncuz you might have more than one domain.\n\n492\n00:23:00.410 --> 00:23:05.570\nOr I can login as LAB/titus.\n\n493\n00:23:05.570 --> 00:23:07.650\nAll three refer to the same account.\n\n494\n00:23:07.650 --> 00:23:08.990\nSo it's whichever one you want.\n\n495\n00:23:08.990 --> 00:23:11.610\nWhat I normally do when I set this up for\npeople, is set it up so\n\n496\n00:23:11.610 --> 00:23:13.430\nthe UPN matches their email address.\n\n497\n00:23:13.430 --> 00:23:15.290\nAnd then I say,\njust login with your email address.\n\n498\n00:23:15.290 --> 00:23:16.750\nSo people are kind of used to that.\n\n499\n00:23:16.750 --> 00:23:17.460\nOops.\n\n500\n00:23:17.460 --> 00:23:20.517\nI dallied too long, so\nI'm gonna log in that way.\n\n501\n00:23:20.517 --> 00:23:23.809\nI'll say titus@lab.itpro.tv, all right?\n\n502\n00:23:23.809 --> 00:23:27.511\nAnd then I'll punch in his password,\nsuper secret password, and\n\n503\n00:23:27.511 --> 00:23:29.530\nnow we're getting logged in.\n\n504\n00:23:29.530 --> 00:23:32.960\nAnd in the background, our computer's\nsaying, I don't have an account for Titus.\n\n505\n00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:35.670\nLet me reach out to that\nMicrosoft Active Directory.\n\n506\n00:23:35.670 --> 00:23:38.640\nAnd ask that server, hey,\nis this a good username and password?\n\n507\n00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:40.960\nAnd the active directory is gonna say,\nyeah, that's a good username and\n\n508\n00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:42.430\npassword, let him in.\n\n509\n00:23:42.430 --> 00:23:46.880\nAnd here we go, I'm logged in, and\nI'm able to access the system and work.\n\n510\n00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:48.255\nI'm logged in as Titus, all right?\n\n511\n00:23:48.255 --> 00:23:53.722\nAnd if I go to my System Preferences and\nI go into Users & Groups,\n\n512\n00:23:53.722 --> 00:23:58.297\nthere it is, Titus Rush,\nNetwork account Managed.\n\n513\n00:23:58.297 --> 00:24:01.335\nManaged means that the active directory\nserver's pushing some kind of\n\n514\n00:24:01.335 --> 00:24:02.254\nrestrictions on me.\n\n515\n00:24:02.254 --> 00:24:04.672\nRight?\n\n516\n00:24:04.672 --> 00:24:08.101\nMicrosoft has this default password policy\nthat makes you reset your password every\n\n517\n00:24:08.101 --> 00:24:11.640\ntwo months and use a certain complexity\nand all of that's what's coming down.\n\n518\n00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:13.372\nSo it just shows as a managed account.\n\n519\n00:24:13.372 --> 00:24:16.560\nAll right, you have to be careful\nbecause you'll also see that we have\n\n520\n00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:19.540\nparental controls turned on and\nthat's not what it means here,\n\n521\n00:24:19.540 --> 00:24:22.770\nit's a security policy stuff so\nit's not parental controls.\n\n522\n00:24:22.770 --> 00:24:24.950\n>> Big brothers watching you Don [LAUGH]\n>> That's right.\n\n523\n00:24:24.950 --> 00:24:27.600\nBut now he's logged in with the active\ndirectory he can go to other Windows\n\n524\n00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:30.060\ncomputers and log in with this account,\nhe can go to Macs now and\n\n525\n00:24:30.060 --> 00:24:30.910\nlogin with this account.\n\n526\n00:24:30.910 --> 00:24:33.420\nIt works on all those different systems.\n\n527\n00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:35.830\nAnd he just has one user name and\npassword that he has to remember.\n\n528\n00:24:35.830 --> 00:24:38.220\nHe's able to login and\nwork with the system.\n\n529\n00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:39.400\nIt's now part of the active directory.\n\n530\n00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:43.190\nIn fact, if I go back to my\nactive directory here, and\n\n531\n00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:46.950\nI go to Computers, I see nothing.\n\n532\n00:24:46.950 --> 00:24:47.860\nWell let me refresh that.\n\n533\n00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:48.610\nThere we go.\n[LAUGH]\n\n534\n00:24:48.610 --> 00:24:50.338\nIf I refresh the screen, I'll see it.\n\n535\n00:24:50.338 --> 00:24:53.250\nThere's and osx-client01, right?\n\n536\n00:24:53.250 --> 00:24:55.360\nThere's that computer\nright in active directory.\n\n537\n00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:59.690\nAnd if I pull it up and take a look at it,\nI can see it's got a workstation or\n\n538\n00:24:59.690 --> 00:25:01.860\na server it's got it's basic information.\n\n539\n00:25:01.860 --> 00:25:06.410\nOperating System Mac OS X version 10.11.3.\n\n540\n00:25:06.410 --> 00:25:07.640\nIt's a part of the active directory.\n\n541\n00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:10.860\nIt's playing nice with that\ncentral domain controller.\n\n542\n00:25:10.860 --> 00:25:13.250\nNow the cool part here from\nmanagement perspective.\n\n543\n00:25:13.250 --> 00:25:16.410\nIs I can do things in one place and\nhave it take effect everywhere.\n\n544\n00:25:16.410 --> 00:25:19.910\nSo, for example,\nlet's say that we fire Titus, right?\n\n545\n00:25:19.910 --> 00:25:22.460\nI have had enough of that guy,\nlet me tell you.\n\n546\n00:25:22.460 --> 00:25:25.330\nYou guys don't see him on camera, but\nreally he's just a pain to be around.\n\n547\n00:25:25.330 --> 00:25:28.680\nSo, I decide to fire him and\nhe's gonna do bad stuff on the network.\n\n548\n00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:31.390\nSo, I come in here and\nI just disable his account, right?\n\n549\n00:25:31.390 --> 00:25:34.050\nSo, I'm gonna come in here and\ndisable that account.\n\n550\n00:25:34.050 --> 00:25:36.060\nAnd now, he's disabled.\n\n551\n00:25:36.060 --> 00:25:38.570\nHe's not allowed to log in on the network,\nright?\n\n552\n00:25:38.570 --> 00:25:39.790\nI've kicked him out.\n\n553\n00:25:39.790 --> 00:25:43.820\nAnd if I jump back over here,\nwell he's still logged in here right, but\n\n554\n00:25:43.820 --> 00:25:44.702\nif he logs out.\n\n555\n00:25:44.702 --> 00:25:46.117\nLog him out.\n\n556\n00:25:46.117 --> 00:25:48.974\nAnd I've got the security to chase\nhim out of the office, so he's out,\n\n557\n00:25:48.974 --> 00:25:51.783\nand he just sneaks right back in\nthrough the break room or something and\n\n558\n00:25:51.783 --> 00:25:55.780\ngoes to somebody else's machine, he sits\ndown and says I'm going to log in, right?\n\n559\n00:25:55.780 --> 00:26:02.730\nWell, he comes in to log in and\nlet's get this punched in.\n\n560\n00:26:02.730 --> 00:26:06.070\nAnd the computer takes\nhis account information,\n\n561\n00:26:06.070 --> 00:26:10.460\nsends it over to the Active Directory and\nhe's not allowed to log in.\n\n562\n00:26:10.460 --> 00:26:12.030\nHis account's been disabled.\n\n563\n00:26:12.030 --> 00:26:13.470\nRight?\nHe can't get in.\n\n564\n00:26:13.470 --> 00:26:14.730\nThe system's now secure.\n\n565\n00:26:14.730 --> 00:26:16.030\nRight?\nThat's what centralized\n\n566\n00:26:16.030 --> 00:26:16.950\nmanagement gets us.\n\n567\n00:26:16.950 --> 00:26:19.110\nIf I have 1000 Macs.\n\n568\n00:26:19.110 --> 00:26:23.100\nI disable him in one place and now he\ncan't log into any of those thousand max.\n\n569\n00:26:23.100 --> 00:26:26.310\nRight that’s the importance of\na Central Directory Service and\n\n570\n00:26:26.310 --> 00:26:28.100\nit really does provide\nthe great functionality.\n\n571\n00:26:28.100 --> 00:26:32.230\nAnd if you got bought Windows and Mac.\n\n572\n00:26:32.230 --> 00:26:36.050\nUsing the Windows active directory really\nis gonna give you that one central place.\n\n573\n00:26:36.050 --> 00:26:39.096\nWindows machine can't\nauthenticate open directory yet\n\n574\n00:26:39.096 --> 00:26:42.020\nMacs can authenticate\nagainst the active directory.\n\n575\n00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:45.270\nSo when you've got both, you normally\nare gonna choose the active directory.\n\n576\n00:26:45.270 --> 00:26:47.540\nYou're not gonna choose open\ndirectory in that scenario.\n\n577\n00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:48.250\n>> Yeah.\nAnd\n\n578\n00:26:48.250 --> 00:26:52.200\nWindows active directory is\nprobably the soup du jour, right?\n\n579\n00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:55.050\nIt's most likely what you're gonna\nbe dealing with when it comes to\n\n580\n00:26:55.050 --> 00:26:55.890\na directory structure.\n\n581\n00:26:55.890 --> 00:26:57.980\nNot that you can't see the other,\nbut by and\n\n582\n00:26:57.980 --> 00:27:02.940\nlarge Windows active directory is taking\na large bite out of the market share.\n\n583\n00:27:02.940 --> 00:27:04.560\nSo I actually would have dealt with this.\n\n584\n00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:07.450\nI've worked in large active\ndirectory environments and\n\n585\n00:27:07.450 --> 00:27:10.630\nwe had some people go you know what,\nI'm a Mac user.\n\n586\n00:27:10.630 --> 00:27:12.260\nMaybe some graphics people,\n\n587\n00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:15.800\nprinting people, they enjoy their\nMac's cuz they do a great job at that.\n\n588\n00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:18.670\nAnd I would have been lost and\nit shows you how far they've come.\n\n589\n00:27:18.670 --> 00:27:20.870\nVery easy to integrate this.\n\n590\n00:27:20.870 --> 00:27:22.250\nInto the active directory environment.\n\n591\n00:27:22.250 --> 00:27:23.850\nThat was not difficult at all though.\n\n592\n00:27:23.850 --> 00:27:26.900\n>> No it isn't assuming you know\nthe quirks of active director.\n\n593\n00:27:26.900 --> 00:27:28.560\nI had to know to set the DNS server.\n\n594\n00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:30.760\nI had to know the formats of\nthe name of the server but\n\n595\n00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:33.320\nassuming you have that\nknowledge it really is easy.\n\n596\n00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:34.680\nNow they can act and\n\n597\n00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:37.550\nit's really no different than managing\na Windows machine at that point.\n\n598\n00:27:37.550 --> 00:27:40.490\nThere's no obstacle to bringing\nsystems into your network.\n\n599\n00:27:40.490 --> 00:27:42.280\n>> Now we can take that chocolate.\n\n600\n00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:43.200\nAnd the peanut butter and\n\n601\n00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:46.680\nput them together in a tasty\ntreat which we do enjoy.\n\n602\n00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:50.010\nDon is there anything else\nabout working with Macs and\n\n603\n00:27:50.010 --> 00:27:52.200\ndirectory services in general.\n\n604\n00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:52.840\n>> That's about it.\n\n605\n00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:55.710\nI mean, obviously there's a lot more power\nbehind all these directory servers, but\n\n606\n00:27:55.710 --> 00:27:57.890\nthe basic functionality is what\nwe need to know for the exam and\n\n607\n00:27:57.890 --> 00:27:59.320\nthat's what we've seen here.\n\n608\n00:27:59.320 --> 00:27:59.900\n>> All right Don.\n\n609\n00:27:59.900 --> 00:28:03.510\nWell thanks for stopping by and\nexplaining these Mac basics to us.\n\n610\n00:28:03.510 --> 00:28:06.930\nIntegrating our Mac systems inside\nof an active directory environment.\n\n611\n00:28:06.930 --> 00:28:10.750\nNot too difficult, and we need it for the\nexam, so it's definitely a good place for\n\n612\n00:28:10.750 --> 00:28:11.670\nyou to get started.\n\n613\n00:28:11.670 --> 00:28:13.590\nThat being said, looks like we've\nwrapped up another good show.\n\n614\n00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:15.710\nHopefully you guys have enjoyed it and\nlearned something.\n\n615\n00:28:15.710 --> 00:28:18.970\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n616\n00:28:18.970 --> 00:28:19.660\n>> And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n617\n00:28:19.660 --> 00:28:21.576\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n618\n00:28:21.576 --> 00:28:26.488\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

back, Daniel.\n\n10\n00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.520\nReady to jump right back into\nthe world of Mac integration basics.\n\n11\n00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.290\nAnd in this episode,\nwe're gonna take a look at file sharing.\n\n12\n00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:39.206\nHow we can exchange information\nbetween our Mac and other systems.\n\n13\n00:00:39.206 --> 00:00:42.422\nAnd we'll talk a little bit about\nfile sharing between Macs and\n\n14\n00:00:42.422 --> 00:00:44.310\nother Macs cuz that's kind of cool.\n\n15\n00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:46.290\nBut this is an integration show, right?\n\n16\n00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:48.500\nSo we need to be able to share files and\n\n17\n00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.382\nexchange data with other systems\nthat aren't necessarily Macs.\n\n18\n00:00:51.382 --> 00:00:53.846\nSo we'll talk about a few other\nprotocols that are out there for\n\n19\n00:00:53.846 --> 00:00:55.487\nUnix based systems and Windows systems.\n\n20\n00:00:55.487 --> 00:00:58.862\nAnd you'll find that it's actually\npretty easy to exchange files and\n\n21\n00:00:58.862 --> 00:00:59.785\nget things going.\n\n22\n00:00:59.785 --> 00:01:02.860\nNow, when we talk about file sharing,\nthere's two angles we wanna look at it.\n\n23\n00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.789\nWe wanna look at it from the side\nof a Mac being the client.\n\n24\n00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.820\nIn other words,\nour Mac reaching out on the network and\n\n25\n00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.390\ngetting files from somebody else.\n\n26\n00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.340\nBut we also wanna look at it from\nthe aspect of our Mac being the server,\n\n27\n00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.750\nthe person that's sharing out these\nfiles and giving them to other people.\n\n28\n00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:19.970\nAnd you'll find that you've\ngot a lot of compatibility.\n\n29\n00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.340\nA lot of stuff is built in that\njust makes it really easy to do.\n\n30\n00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.660\nAnd you can be exchanging data on\nyour network in a short order.\n\n31\n00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:30.949\nIt used to be really challenging\nto share files over the network.\n\n32\n00:01:30.949 --> 00:01:34.254\nI remember some of the first Macs I\nworked on that were networked, right?\n\n33\n00:01:34.254 --> 00:01:35.998\nSo a lot of use had Apple IIes and\n\n34\n00:01:35.998 --> 00:01:40.220\nthings like that back in the day\nthat just weren't on the network.\n\n35\n00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:45.010\nBut I had these SE20s back in the day\nthat had the old Apple Talk network.\n\n36\n00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:48.550\nAnd it was a lot of effort to\nget those adaptors hooked up, to\n\n37\n00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:51.260\nrun those little phone cables around, to\nget all that stuff hooked up and in place.\n\n38\n00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:52.506\nThen get everything configured to share.\n\n39\n00:01:52.506 --> 00:01:56.758\nToday, having a TCP/IP based\nnetwork is pretty ubiquitous.\n\n40\n00:01:56.758 --> 00:01:57.783\nPretty much everybody has that.\n\n41\n00:01:57.783 --> 00:02:00.120\nYou've got a wireless network or\na wired network.\n\n42\n00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.240\nYou plug right in,\nyou get your IP address.\n\n43\n00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.260\nAfter that, sharing things is\nactually really super easy.\n\n44\n00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.590\nBut it is important that we run\nthrough all the different options that\n\n45\n00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.810\nare available,\nbecause they do show up on the exam.\n\n46\n00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.680\n>> Yeah, I guess that can be a little\nconfusing to the newcomer of sharing\n\n47\n00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.580\nfiles, especially inside of Mac,\nsuch as myself.\n\n48\n00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.550\nI've only been running a Mac for\nabout a year, and\n\n49\n00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:21.030\nI don't do a lot of file sharing.\n\n50\n00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.800\nBut there are tons of ways and\n\n51\n00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.440\nprotocols that are available\nthrough the TCP/IP protocol itself,\n\n52\n00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.530\nto actually be able to make connections\nand share files, right, Don?\n\n53\n00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:30.430\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n54\n00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.310\nAnd it's all kinda built\ninto the Mac already.\n\n55\n00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.970\nWhere I say it can be super easy,\nlet me just show you an example here.\n\n56\n00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.030\nWe'll just use straight up Mac sharing and\nit's called personal file sharing.\n\n57\n00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:42.920\nKinda get a chance to see how that works.\n\n58\n00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.810\nAnd I'm just gonna take\na folder real quick.\n\n59\n00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.600\nI've got a server here, but actually\nI'm not gonna use the server piece.\n\n60\n00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.830\nLet me just,\nshare out a folder real quick.\n\n61\n00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.470\nSo I'm gonna jump into my\nsystem preferences and\n\n62\n00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:52.820\ngo into the sharing folder.\n\n63\n00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.690\nAnd I'm just gonna share something\nreal quick on this system.\n\n64\n00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:59.330\nAnd we'll share this software\nfolder I've got on my desktop.\n\n65\n00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.220\nAnd I want to make that\navailable on the network.\n\n66\n00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:02.790\nSo when I add that and\n\n67\n00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.700\nshare it out, I'm just kind of giving\naccess to people and there we go.\n\n68\n00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:11.620\nNow, for a client, if I'm on a Mac and\nI wanna browse and\n\n69\n00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.590\nconnect to another Mac's data\non the same network as me,\n\n70\n00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.510\nI really don't have to do\na whole lot of crazy stuff.\n\n71\n00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.012\nWhen you launch your Finder,\n\n72\n00:03:20.012 --> 00:03:23.448\nin your Finder you're normally\nlooking at your own stuff, right?\n\n73\n00:03:23.448 --> 00:03:27.728\nSo, I see my favorites, I see my devices\nlike my Macintosh hard drive, right?\n\n74\n00:03:27.728 --> 00:03:28.915\nThese are the things that I see.\n\n75\n00:03:28.915 --> 00:03:31.049\nBut right beneath it, I've got Shared.\n\n76\n00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:36.580\nAnd under Shared, I start to see\ncomputers on my network, right?\n\n77\n00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:39.600\nThese are other computers that\nare out there on the network and\n\n78\n00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.060\nyou'll see I'm connected to\nthe ITProTV studio network so\n\n79\n00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:43.775\nI've got all sorts of\nstuff showing up in here.\n\n80\n00:03:43.775 --> 00:03:47.330\nThomas' laptop, he's in the office\nover on the other side of that wall.\n\n81\n00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:49.410\nAnd a couple other things,\nour editing station.\n\n82\n00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.280\nThese are all different computers\nthat are showing up on the network,\n\n83\n00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.660\nincluding my laptop and other servers.\n\n84\n00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.980\nI can browse and connect to these guys.\n\n85\n00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:00.870\nAnd I didn't have to configure anything,\nit just found them.\n\n86\n00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.430\nSo your Macs,\nthey run a protocol called Bonjour.\n\n87\n00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:07.500\nAnd what Bonjour does it allows one Mac to\ndiscover other Macs on the network, and\n\n88\n00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.200\nit can even discover\nnon-Macs in some scenarios.\n\n89\n00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.300\nNotice how this OSX-SERVER01 right here,\nhow it's got a question mark on it?\n\n90\n00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:16.600\nThat probably means that device\nis not online right now, or\n\n91\n00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:18.450\nthat I'm not seeing it for some reason.\n\n92\n00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:20.600\nI might be on a different network,\nor whatever, or\n\n93\n00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.730\njust can't identify what the machine is.\n\n94\n00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:27.685\nBut some of these other ones,\nlike DPLAPTOP-OSX, that's my laptop.\n\n95\n00:04:27.685 --> 00:04:30.535\nAnd it shows its little icon cuz it knows\nthat it's a laptop because it's another\n\n96\n00:04:30.535 --> 00:04:34.575\nMac, and it's communicating to it,\nand OSX exchanges that information.\n\n97\n00:04:34.575 --> 00:04:37.421\nAnd I can browse to one of these\nguys to access the files and\n\n98\n00:04:37.421 --> 00:04:39.032\ninformation that's on there.\n\n99\n00:04:39.032 --> 00:04:43.388\nAnd when I browse to it, the only thing\nthat it's gonna do is it's gonna ask me to\n\n100\n00:04:43.388 --> 00:04:47.700\nauthenticate, and when I click on it,\nso like if I click on OSX-SERVER01.\n\n101\n00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:50.280\nI can see,\nthere's Don Pezet's Public Folder and\n\n102\n00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:54.200\nthere's that Software folder I\nshared just a moment ago, all right?\n\n103\n00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:57.450\nNow, sometimes you'll connect to\na system and you won't see anything.\n\n104\n00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:03.460\nAnd the reason is this little blurb\nright here, connected as guest.\n\n105\n00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:05.740\nI've connected to that system anonymously.\n\n106\n00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:07.760\nNo user name, no password.\n\n107\n00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:11.100\nAnd so I'm only seeing things that\nare available to basically everybody.\n\n108\n00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:13.170\nSometimes you'll connect and\nyou'll see nothing.\n\n109\n00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:15.905\nSo, for example, if I try and\nconnect to this editing station.\n\n110\n00:05:15.905 --> 00:05:18.470\nThis is the editing station\nhere in our studio,\n\n111\n00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:21.999\nwhere they store a lot of our videos\nas they're being produced and\n\n112\n00:05:21.999 --> 00:05:25.093\nI've connected to it,\nwell, no, I haven't, right?\n\n113\n00:05:25.093 --> 00:05:26.825\nSee how it says Not Connected?\n\n114\n00:05:26.825 --> 00:05:28.265\nThere's nothing in here.\n\n115\n00:05:28.265 --> 00:05:31.185\nI'm not connected because we don't\nallow anonymous access to that machine,\n\n116\n00:05:31.185 --> 00:05:33.065\nit's gotta be authenticated access.\n\n117\n00:05:33.065 --> 00:05:37.445\nAnd so I've got a little Connect As\nbutton here we can use to provide\n\n118\n00:05:37.445 --> 00:05:41.755\na registered user name and password to be\nable to connect to that system, all right?\n\n119\n00:05:41.755 --> 00:05:45.615\nSo when you connect to resources on the\nnetwork, some are going to be anonymous,\n\n120\n00:05:45.615 --> 00:05:48.625\nthat you can just connect to, and\nyou'll get certain levels of access.\n\n121\n00:05:48.625 --> 00:05:51.690\nOthers ones will require a username and\na password.\n\n122\n00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:54.970\nAnd depending on the type of system,\nit may be expecting that username and\n\n123\n00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:59.330\npassword in different formats, so as the\nclient, we just have to be aware of that.\n\n124\n00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:01.960\nIf it's Mac to Mac, like I'm doing\nright here, it's super easy.\n\n125\n00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.260\nWe just go under our Shared section,\n\n126\n00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:08.980\nwe find the system we want to connect\nto and we click on it, right?\n\n127\n00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:10.680\nAnd we might need to hit Connect As.\n\n128\n00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:12.190\nIf you're in an Open Directory\nenvironment,\n\n129\n00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:13.580\nyou're already authenticated and\nyou're fine.\n\n130\n00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:15.620\nBut if you're not in Open Directory,\nyou'll have to hit Connect As and\n\n131\n00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:16.640\nput in your username and password.\n\n132\n00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:18.730\nAnd you get connected up, and that's that.\n\n133\n00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:22.680\nSo being on the client side is not\na big deal, if it's Mac to Mac.\n\n134\n00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:30.600\nBut what if I'm connecting Mac to Linux or\nMac to Windows?\n\n135\n00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:32.870\nWell, that's where things\nget a little different.\n\n136\n00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:35.170\nThe protocol that's being used here,\nI mentioned Bonjour, right?\n\n137\n00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:36.500\nBonjour is a discovery protocol.\n\n138\n00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:40.460\nThat's how we find people on the network,\nbut that's not how we transfer files.\n\n139\n00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:42.090\nOnce you find them,\n\n140\n00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:45.990\nMac talking to Mac will exchange\nfiles using something called AFP.\n\n141\n00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:48.600\nAFP is the Apple File Protocol.\n\n142\n00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:51.360\nAnd it's just a simple file protocol\nthat Apple made that allows us to\n\n143\n00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:53.490\nexchange files over the network,\nworks great, right?\n\n144\n00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:56.930\nThat's AFP and that's what I was\ntechnically using there when I browsed and\n\n145\n00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:58.390\nsaw that content.\n\n146\n00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:03.700\nBut Windows machines don't run AFP,\nLinux machines don't run AFP.\n\n147\n00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:07.440\nSo if I want to talk to them, I'm going\nto have to use a different protocol.\n\n148\n00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:11.930\nAnd fortunately, your Mac, it's already\ngot those protocols built into it.\n\n149\n00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:13.780\nLet me show you what I mean there.\n\n150\n00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:16.550\nSo, when I browse into the Finder,\n\n151\n00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:21.610\nI'm only seeing devices that can\nbe discovered by Bonjour, right?\n\n152\n00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:23.530\nBut I'm not gonna find\nWindows machines that way.\n\n153\n00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:26.881\nIn fact, my Windows machine,\nI've got one parked right here, right?\n\n154\n00:07:26.881 --> 00:07:29.140\nSo this is a Windows 10 machine.\n\n155\n00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:31.470\nLet me see if I can get\nlogged into it real quick.\n\n156\n00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:34.680\nSo this is a Windows 10 machine\nthat's on the same network as my Mac.\n\n157\n00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:37.870\nAnd when I get logged into it, eventually.\n\n158\n00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:41.010\nIt's up and running on the same\nnetwork and it's called, my goodness,\n\n159\n00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:43.100\nthose are some giant icons.\n\n160\n00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:48.320\nBut anyhow, this machine is called,\nif I remember it right, Win-Client01.\n\n161\n00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:49.890\nSo that's the name of this machine.\n\n162\n00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:52.800\nAnd I'm just gonna verify that real quick.\n\n163\n00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:54.572\nI was wanting to change my font size.\n\n164\n00:07:54.572 --> 00:07:56.135\nThat's probably a good thing.\n\n165\n00:07:56.135 --> 00:07:56.780\nWoah, well, shoot.\n\n166\n00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:57.589\nI'm gonna log out.\nSo anyhow,\n\n167\n00:07:57.589 --> 00:07:59.544\nit is called Win-Client01,\nI'm pretty certain.\n\n168\n00:07:59.544 --> 00:08:02.257\nBut when I come over here to my Mac and\n\n169\n00:08:02.257 --> 00:08:06.692\nI look at what's in my list\nI don't see Win-Client01,\n\n170\n00:08:06.692 --> 00:08:12.800\nif I click all now I start to see a little\nmore and there it is, Win-Client01.\n\n171\n00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:16.150\nAnd it even knows it's\na windows machine an Apple,\n\n172\n00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:18.550\nthis is one of Apples\nhidden Easter eggs right?\n\n173\n00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:23.230\nBecause they make sure to use an CRT\nmonitor and the Windows blue screen of\n\n174\n00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:25.220\ndeath, that's what you see when\nthe Windows machine crashes.\n\n175\n00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:26.450\nThat's what they put in for the icon,\n\n176\n00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:29.000\nit's kind of a funny little\njab there that Microsoft.\n\n177\n00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.400\nBut it sees win-client01.\n\n178\n00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:33.820\nNow, my Windows client\nis not running Bonjour.\n\n179\n00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:36.860\nAnd it's not running\nthe Apple file protocol.\n\n180\n00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:38.520\nSo how do I see it?\n\n181\n00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:41.170\nWell your Mac is actually\nrunning a whole collection of\n\n182\n00:08:41.170 --> 00:08:43.350\nprotocols to be able to\nsee these other devices.\n\n183\n00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:44.560\nThere's some of them like NFS.\n\n184\n00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:47.120\nWhich is the network file system.\n\n185\n00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:49.650\nNSF is used by Unix and Linux systems.\n\n186\n00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:54.170\nRemember under the hood\nOS10 is running BSD.\n\n187\n00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:56.040\nBSD is a variant of Unix.\n\n188\n00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:58.590\nSo OS10 is a Unix based system.\n\n189\n00:08:58.590 --> 00:09:00.280\nIt makes sense for it to support NFS.\n\n190\n00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:02.260\nBut Windows that's completely different.\n\n191\n00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:05.370\nAnd so for\nWindows your Mac is running SMB.\n\n192\n00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:08.170\nSMB is the Server Message Block.\n\n193\n00:09:08.170 --> 00:09:11.140\nAnd Server Message Block is\na file transfer protocol that was\n\n194\n00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:12.940\noriginally developed by Intel.\n\n195\n00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:16.800\nBut Microsoft bought it and so it's\na Microsoft technology for communicating.\n\n196\n00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:17.880\nAnd your Mac supports it.\n\n197\n00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:19.020\nSo it can talk.\n\n198\n00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:21.280\nApple has actually licensed\nthat from Microsoft.\n\n199\n00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:24.700\nSo they pay for that, to have that\ncompatibility between the systems.\n\n200\n00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:26.070\nSo we've got SMB.\n\n201\n00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:30.340\nOn the exam, they'll usually call it SMB.\n\n202\n00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:35.700\nBut sometimes, every now and then, they'll\nrefer to it as CIFS, which is C-I-F-S.\n\n203\n00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:38.660\nAnd that's\nthe Common Internet File System.\n\n204\n00:09:39.970 --> 00:09:42.130\nSMB is a Microsoft thing, it's theirs.\n\n205\n00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:44.170\nThey own the rights to it.\n\n206\n00:09:44.170 --> 00:09:46.990\nBut they've started making it available\nfor free to other people, but\n\n207\n00:09:46.990 --> 00:09:51.560\nwhen they did that, they held on to\nthe SMB trademark; and so it's available\n\n208\n00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:57.180\npublicly as cifs, C-I-F-S and\nit's available licensed in private as SMB.\n\n209\n00:09:57.180 --> 00:10:00.763\nWell Apple is actually licensed, so\nthey can call it SMB if they want or\n\n210\n00:10:00.763 --> 00:10:02.540\nthey can call it CIFS if they want.\n\n211\n00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:03.900\nAnd so on the exam,\nyou might see either one but\n\n212\n00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:05.300\nit's really talking about the same thing,\nright?\n\n213\n00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:09.570\nSo the Common Internet File System,\nCIFS, and SMB, Server Message Block,\n\n214\n00:10:09.570 --> 00:10:10.950\nreally the same, same technology.\n\n215\n00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:15.330\n>> So Don, why would anyone license\nSMB if they can get CIFS for free?\n\n216\n00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:18.910\n>> So the deal is that Microsoft can\nchange SMB whenever they want, and\n\n217\n00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:19.560\nthey do, right?\n\n218\n00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:22.300\nSo the current version of\nSMB is SMB version four.\n\n219\n00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:25.084\nWhereas CIFS is actually\nat SMB version three.\n\n220\n00:10:25.084 --> 00:10:28.000\nAnd SMB version four they\nadded some encryption and\n\n221\n00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.880\nother features that\naren't present in three.\n\n222\n00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:31.470\nSo you can end up where things break.\n\n223\n00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:34.500\nSo Apple said you know what,\nour system is supposed to be magic,\n\n224\n00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:37.380\nit's supposed to just work right,\nso, let's license that and\n\n225\n00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:39.670\nmake sure it just works and that way\npeople don't have to fuss with it.\n\n226\n00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:41.635\nAnd I don't think Microsoft\ncharges that much for it anyway.\n\n227\n00:10:41.635 --> 00:10:45.140\n[LAUGH] So, any how,\nthat's kinda where it's at and\n\n228\n00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:47.930\nso I see that system on the network and\nI can browse to it and connect.\n\n229\n00:10:47.930 --> 00:10:53.420\nSo if I take that Win-client01 and I\ndouble click on it, it's gonna connect and\n\n230\n00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:58.100\nI'll see file shares that are available\non it and I may see something, I may not.\n\n231\n00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:02.000\nNow on a Windows machine, often times\nyou're not allowed to connect anonymous,\n\n232\n00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.380\nand so\nI kind of expect to see nothing here.\n\n233\n00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:07.560\nAnd well, that says it's connecting,\nit's just kind of sitting there.\n\n234\n00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:12.450\nI can hit Connect As, and specify a user\nname and password to connect, right?\n\n235\n00:11:12.450 --> 00:11:15.360\nAnd honestly, I don't remember what\nmy user name is on that system.\n\n236\n00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:17.360\nLet me go over there and\nlog in real quick, and\n\n237\n00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:18.500\nfigure out what my user name is.\n\n238\n00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:22.400\nSo when I get connected to this thing,\n\n239\n00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:26.780\nin Windows you have a user name\nthat's assigned to your account.\n\n240\n00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:27.850\nI just need to figure out what mine is.\n\n241\n00:11:27.850 --> 00:11:29.650\nI think it's Don Pezet.\n\n242\n00:11:29.650 --> 00:11:31.970\nThat's not where I wanted to be.\n\n243\n00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:33.725\nEventually I'll get there.\n\n244\n00:11:33.725 --> 00:11:37.205\nSo but basically when we connect we\njust need to provide a username and\n\n245\n00:11:37.205 --> 00:11:41.085\na password so we can get an established\nconnection to the system and\n\n246\n00:11:41.085 --> 00:11:45.085\nonce we're in there we can browse in and\nsee files and folders and so on.\n\n247\n00:11:45.085 --> 00:11:49.485\nSo, my,\nI guess my user account is don_pezet.\n\n248\n00:11:49.485 --> 00:11:51.555\nAll right, well, we can certainly do that.\n\n249\n00:11:51.555 --> 00:11:55.290\nSo, I'm gonna punch in my password and\nI'm gonna connect.\n\n250\n00:11:55.290 --> 00:11:58.350\nNow if I choose to remember the password\nin the keychain that's kind of nice\n\n251\n00:11:58.350 --> 00:12:00.990\nbecause I won't have to provide\nthat password every time I connect.\n\n252\n00:12:00.990 --> 00:12:04.306\nIt will just all ready be there, so I'm\ngonna go ahead and choose to save that.\n\n253\n00:12:04.306 --> 00:12:06.164\nAnd we're gonna reach out and\nconnect to that system.\n\n254\n00:12:06.164 --> 00:12:10.556\nSo now it's using SMB to communicate\nwith that Windows box and hand off this\n\n255\n00:12:10.556 --> 00:12:16.040\nusername and password and say hey this is\nme can I connect to this file or folder.\n\n256\n00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:17.400\nAnd the other side should be saying yeah,\n\n257\n00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:20.600\nsure, you can connect here's the list\nof folders that I've got have at it.\n\n258\n00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:21.340\nRight?\n\n259\n00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:24.870\nNow, I get my little spinning gear so\nsomething's going wrong right,\n\n260\n00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:26.950\nit's not connecting like it should.\n\n261\n00:12:26.950 --> 00:12:29.870\nSo, there could be any number of\nproblems that are stopping this.\n\n262\n00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:32.980\nAnd this is really the big challenge\nwith file communications is if you\n\n263\n00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:36.480\nhave network connectivity issues,\nif you have underlying problems.\n\n264\n00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:38.270\nYou're not gonna be\nable to exchange files.\n\n265\n00:12:38.270 --> 00:12:39.960\nSo, while this is trying to connect,\n\n266\n00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:43.020\nthere's a few things that we\ncan test to find out, right?\n\n267\n00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:44.420\nIf I take a look at my Windows machine,\n\n268\n00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:46.660\nI'm just gonna jump over\nto the Windows machine and\n\n269\n00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:49.117\nI know that it's called Win-Client01.\n\n270\n00:12:49.117 --> 00:12:50.280\nWell, I say I know that.\n\n271\n00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:55.190\nLet me just verify that it is\nactually called Win-Client01 and\n\n272\n00:12:55.190 --> 00:12:58.050\nit is,\nthat's the name that's assigned to it and\n\n273\n00:12:58.050 --> 00:13:01.430\nI'm gonna get the IP address also\nbecause with the Windows machine, or\n\n274\n00:13:01.430 --> 00:13:06.160\na Linux Unix machine,\nyou can connect via name or IP address.\n\n275\n00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:11.072\nAnd so I'm just looking for\nthat IP address,192.168.0.146.\n\n276\n00:13:11.072 --> 00:13:14.270\nAnd the reason I want that is on my Mac.\n\n277\n00:13:14.270 --> 00:13:16.850\nWell it did connect it just\ntook it a little while.\n\n278\n00:13:16.850 --> 00:13:19.300\nIf you're not connecting,\nwe can test that connectivity.\n\n279\n00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:20.970\nSo let's pretend that it didn't connect,\nright?\n\n280\n00:13:20.970 --> 00:13:22.160\nMine connected while I was away,\n\n281\n00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:25.670\nbut on your Mac you have what's\ncalled the network utility.\n\n282\n00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:27.780\nAnd you can fire up the network utility,\n\n283\n00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:30.980\nit's inside of the application\nfolder in the utility folder.\n\n284\n00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:35.420\nAnd it lets you do all sorts of things\nlike verify your own IP address, so\n\n285\n00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:38.570\nI can see my IP is in the same\nrange as that Windows machine.\n\n286\n00:13:38.570 --> 00:13:40.940\nBut I can also do things like ping.\n\n287\n00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:44.400\nAnd ping is really nice\nbecause I can use it to see,\n\n288\n00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:47.170\nhey, can I even ping the Windows machine?\n\n289\n00:13:47.170 --> 00:13:48.020\nCan I talk to it?\n\n290\n00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:51.030\nBecause if I can't ping it then I'm not\ngoing to be able to exchange files either.\n\n291\n00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:52.700\nSo I can run this ping.\n\n292\n00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:53.370\nAnd there it goes.\n\n293\n00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:57.340\nAnd I can see that I'm getting\nmessages back from the other side.\n\n294\n00:13:57.340 --> 00:14:00.330\nSo I'm sending the ping, and\nthese are responses I'm getting back.\n\n295\n00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:03.680\nIf it were to fail,\nI would see something like this.\n\n296\n00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:04.879\nI'm just gonna put a fake IP in here.\n\n297\n00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:07.290\nAnd I'll start that ping again.\n\n298\n00:14:08.670 --> 00:14:09.780\nThere it goes.\n\n299\n00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:11.700\nAnd see how it's saying request timed out?\n\n300\n00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:13.030\nI can't get to this host.\n\n301\n00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:15.920\nIf I can't get to the host with ping,\nI can't exchange files with it,\n\n302\n00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:18.540\nI've got a network issue to troubleshoot,\nall right?\n\n303\n00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:20.980\nWell, in my case it turned out\nI was just being impatient.\n\n304\n00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:23.560\nSo if I go back here,\nI can see that it did connect.\n\n305\n00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:25.860\nAnd there's that Work-Docs, right.\n\n306\n00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:29.610\nAnd if I browse in the Work-Docs, I can\nstart to see documents that are on that\n\n307\n00:14:29.610 --> 00:14:33.310\nmachine things that's being shared out\nover the network and I can copy these and\n\n308\n00:14:33.310 --> 00:14:36.440\npaste to my own computer or\nI can even add it them from right here,\n\n309\n00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:40.590\nI might go on this form letter and\ncrack it open and\n\n310\n00:14:40.590 --> 00:14:45.040\nso, here I am in Text Edit and I can just\ncome in and I can start working this.\n\n311\n00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:48.760\nAnd I can start say it is not full and\ncredible useful information.\n\n312\n00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:50.840\nYou can change it however you want and\nsave it.\n\n313\n00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:52.330\nI'm now working with that document.\n\n314\n00:14:53.680 --> 00:15:00.750\nAll right, now using the finder is,\nshoot, I'm getting a lot of warning here.\n\n315\n00:15:00.750 --> 00:15:02.750\nSorry, I thought it was\ndenying me writing.\n\n316\n00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:04.340\nWhen you share something on the network,\n\n317\n00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:07.120\nyou might only get read\npermission to it and not write.\n\n318\n00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:08.650\nI might be able to open it but not save.\n\n319\n00:15:08.650 --> 00:15:11.380\nAnd I thought I have the write\npermission when I saved it\n\n320\n00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:13.900\nI got this error and I thought it was\nstopping me from writing but it's actually\n\n321\n00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:16.000\nnot stopping me from writing,\nit was warning me about something else.\n\n322\n00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.860\nIt's saying the document Form Letter.rtf\nis on a volume that does not support\n\n323\n00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:23.690\npermanent version storage.\n\n324\n00:15:23.690 --> 00:15:25.570\nWhat is permanent version storage?\n\n325\n00:15:25.570 --> 00:15:29.160\nWell, we're gonna talk more about it\nin the Time Machine episodes, but\n\n326\n00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:31.810\nbasically it's storing multiple\nversions of a document so\n\n327\n00:15:31.810 --> 00:15:34.670\nI can roll it back if I have a problem,\nright?\n\n328\n00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:39.000\nHave you ever deleted some paragraphs out\nof a document and saved it, and said, ooh,\n\n329\n00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.650\nI wish I could get those back?\n\n330\n00:15:40.650 --> 00:15:42.020\nWell, they're gone.\n\n331\n00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:46.920\nWell, if you're storing your documents on\na volume that's formatted with the MacOS\n\n332\n00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:51.660\nextended journal format,\nthen we can have previous versions.\n\n333\n00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:55.070\nYou can restore those previous\nversions of the modified file.\n\n334\n00:15:55.070 --> 00:15:57.260\nIf I'm storing it on the network,\n\n335\n00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:01.648\nthat network drive is probably not\nformatted OSX extended journal.\n\n336\n00:16:01.648 --> 00:16:05.314\nIt's probably formatted NTSF,\nor FAT32, or EXT 2,3,4,\n\n337\n00:16:05.314 --> 00:16:09.765\nwhatever format it is of the day that we\ngot it there And so it doesn't support it,\n\n338\n00:16:09.765 --> 00:16:11.743\nshe was just warning me about that.\n\n339\n00:16:11.743 --> 00:16:16.010\nIt's saying, I will not be able to\naccess older versions once I close this.\n\n340\n00:16:16.010 --> 00:16:18.590\nThen I'm just going to have to\nbe okay with that because they,\n\n341\n00:16:18.590 --> 00:16:20.090\nI don't control the other file system.\n\n342\n00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:24.020\nAll right, so\nthere it is we made some changes.\n\n343\n00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:28.440\nAnd there we go now in the client side,\nusing the finder is probably the easiest.\n\n344\n00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:30.120\nBut it's not the only way.\n\n345\n00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:31.420\nWe actually have other ways.\n\n346\n00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:34.980\nFor example,\nI could have used my go menu up top.\n\n347\n00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:39.140\nWhen you choose go,\nyou can go to Connect to Server.\n\n348\n00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:42.720\nThen when you choose Connect to Server,\nyou can type in server address and\n\n349\n00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:44.570\nhere's we can really go crazy.\n\n350\n00:16:44.570 --> 00:16:50.214\nIf I'm connecting to an Apple system I can\ntype in afp, like Apple File Protocol,\n\n351\n00:16:50.214 --> 00:16:58.540\n:// and a server name/ and then the folder\nthat I wanna go talk to, right.\n\n352\n00:16:58.540 --> 00:17:00.940\nSo on that server,\nI have a folder called Software.\n\n353\n00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:04.870\nSo by punching it in like this,\nI'm telling it I wanna use\n\n354\n00:17:04.870 --> 00:17:07.990\nApple File Protocol, and I'm telling\nit the folder I wanna connect to.\n\n355\n00:17:07.990 --> 00:17:10.890\nAnd I can hit this little + and\nthe nice part is that's\n\n356\n00:17:10.890 --> 00:17:14.480\ngonna save it as a favorite, so I can\ncall this back up whenever I need it.\n\n357\n00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:15.180\nAll right.\n\n358\n00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:19.800\nNow one problem I'm gonna have is that,\nwell sorry that's my recent services,\n\n359\n00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:22.570\nis that when I connect I might need\nto provide a username and a password.\n\n360\n00:17:22.570 --> 00:17:25.420\nSo the first time I connect to this one,\nit may prompt me for that.\n\n361\n00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:26.020\nIt may not.\n\n362\n00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:28.550\nIf I can connect anonymously,\nthen it'll do that too.\n\n363\n00:17:28.550 --> 00:17:30.720\nBut there's me connecting\nto that AFP server, and\n\n364\n00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:31.790\nit's gonna reach out and connect to it.\n\n365\n00:17:31.790 --> 00:17:34.510\nNow I might get an error because\nI'm already connected to it, but\n\n366\n00:17:34.510 --> 00:17:36.030\nwe'll let it sit there and think.\n\n367\n00:17:36.030 --> 00:17:38.990\nAnd while it's doing that,\nI'm just gonna go right back in here.\n\n368\n00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:41.180\nAnd let me show you some of\nthe other ones that we can do.\n\n369\n00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:46.045\nFor example, that Windows server,\nI could type in\n\n370\n00:17:46.045 --> 00:17:53.300\nsmb://win-client01/Work-Docs and\nI can connect to that one.\n\n371\n00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:53.850\nSo that's a SNB.\n\n372\n00:17:53.850 --> 00:17:57.890\nSome of the other protocols that\nare out there, what did we get?\n\n373\n00:17:59.830 --> 00:18:02.510\nI must have typed in a wrong\nfolder name or something.\n\n374\n00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:07.740\nBut I can do FNS, so if there's a Linux\nsystem out there, I can say FNS and\n\n375\n00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:11.810\nwhatever that server is and\npoint to a server like that.\n\n376\n00:18:11.810 --> 00:18:14.150\nSome of the other ones that\nare a little less common.\n\n377\n00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:18.160\nYou can do web DAV.\n\n378\n00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:20.470\nWeb distributed authoring and versioning.\n\n379\n00:18:20.470 --> 00:18:24.900\nWeb DAV is not very common at all but\nit's another one that's out there.\n\n380\n00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:26.870\nAnd you connect to it with HTTP.\n\n381\n00:18:26.870 --> 00:18:30.060\nIt actually uses hyper text transport\nprotocol just like a webpage\n\n382\n00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:31.420\nto be able to exchange files.\n\n383\n00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:33.370\nAgain you don't see that one very often.\n\n384\n00:18:34.770 --> 00:18:36.690\nOne that you do though is ftp.\n\n385\n00:18:36.690 --> 00:18:40.980\nIf I wanna connect to a file transfer\nprotocol system, right ftp I can specify\n\n386\n00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:45.210\na server out there, and I know one by IP,\nso I'll just punch it in this way.\n\n387\n00:18:45.210 --> 00:18:49.660\nSo I'll just specify that, and\nnow I can connect to an ftp server.\n\n388\n00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:51.560\nAnd the cool part here is,\nwhen we go to connect to it,\n\n389\n00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:56.800\nI'll just connect as a guest,\nI'm connecting to an FTP server, but\n\n390\n00:18:56.800 --> 00:18:58.720\nit looks like a folder on my hard drive.\n\n391\n00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:01.340\nI can just browse through it like\na folder and come in and here,\n\n392\n00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:03.540\nI'll check out this 7941 folder.\n\n393\n00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:07.760\nAnd I start browsing in, and it's like\nany other folder on my network, right.\n\n394\n00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:15.350\nSo we saw SMB, AFP, FTP,\nWebDAV, and is that it?\n\n395\n00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:16.240\nI did the four?\n\n396\n00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:17.990\nAm I leaving one out?\n\n397\n00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:21.510\nWell six but that's just another name for\nthe same one.\n\n398\n00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:25.050\nFor the exam, you'll want to remember each\nof those because it's very common to get\n\n399\n00:19:25.050 --> 00:19:28.620\na question that's something like, which of\nthe following is not a protocol supported\n\n400\n00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:32.730\nby Apple, by file sharing in a Mac, right.\n\n401\n00:19:32.730 --> 00:19:35.710\nFTP and Web DVA and sifts and so on.\n\n402\n00:19:35.710 --> 00:19:39.530\nAnd then they'll throw in some\nkind of fake one like vines.\n\n403\n00:19:39.530 --> 00:19:41.380\nAnd you're like well\nI've never heard of that,\n\n404\n00:19:41.380 --> 00:19:43.360\nso that's obviously the wrong answer,\nright.\n\n405\n00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:46.030\nBut you want to be familiar with\nthe ones that are supported.\n\n406\n00:19:46.030 --> 00:19:48.870\n>> All right, Don well we've gone through\nmany different ways in which we can\n\n407\n00:19:48.870 --> 00:19:50.540\nconnect to a server.\n\n408\n00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:53.420\nGetting out files that we want to share,\nwe want to work with.\n\n409\n00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:54.730\nBut what if, and\n\n410\n00:19:54.730 --> 00:19:58.330\nwe kind of already let the cat out of this\nbag, what if I want to be the server?\n\n411\n00:19:58.330 --> 00:20:02.840\nI'm like, I have lots of really good\nresources on this particular computer.\n\n412\n00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:06.380\nI need to share that out with you or\nthe other people in my office.\n\n413\n00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:07.920\nHow do I do that.\n\n414\n00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:10.530\n>> That's a good point Daniel because\nyou know being a client is one thing,\n\n415\n00:20:10.530 --> 00:20:13.380\nbut being the server is another part\nthat we really do need to look at.\n\n416\n00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:15.940\nAnd on a Mac, there's two different\nways that you can be this server.\n\n417\n00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:16.750\nSo let me show you here.\n\n418\n00:20:16.750 --> 00:20:19.200\nWe'll start with the easy way,\nthe one that everybody can do.\n\n419\n00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:21.840\nAnd on my Mac I've got a folder\nhere called Ringtones.\n\n420\n00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:25.370\nAnd believe me, it is mission critical\nthat I get these ringtones out to as many\n\n421\n00:20:25.370 --> 00:20:26.070\npeople as possible.\n\n422\n00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:28.770\nSo I want to share those out\nto everybody on my network.\n\n423\n00:20:28.770 --> 00:20:31.910\nSo what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna turn\non what is called personal file sharing.\n\n424\n00:20:31.910 --> 00:20:33.900\nPersonal file sharing has been\ndesigned to be done on any Mac.\n\n425\n00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:35.980\nIt just makes it easy to\nshare your stuff out.\n\n426\n00:20:35.980 --> 00:20:39.420\nYou go into system preferences,\nand inside of system preferences,\n\n427\n00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:42.230\nyou can go into the sharing preference.\n\n428\n00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:45.610\nInside of sharing, you'll see a number\nof different things you can share and\n\n429\n00:20:45.610 --> 00:20:46.830\nwe want file sharing.\n\n430\n00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:48.320\nThat's what we're going to be handing out.\n\n431\n00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:50.570\nSo I'm going to turn on file sharing.\n\n432\n00:20:50.570 --> 00:20:53.150\nNow by default you're\nonly sharing one folder.\n\n433\n00:20:53.150 --> 00:20:54.300\nYour public folder.\n\n434\n00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:58.840\nEvery user account has a folder in\ntheir home directory called public and\n\n435\n00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:01.650\nit gives everybody on the network\nread access to that folder, so\n\n436\n00:21:01.650 --> 00:21:03.670\nthat's an easy way, if I just\nwanna quickly share something out,\n\n437\n00:21:03.670 --> 00:21:05.410\nI can just throw this up\nfrom my public folder.\n\n438\n00:21:05.410 --> 00:21:08.920\nI don't need to throw it into\na dedicated folder by itself but\n\n439\n00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:12.640\nif I wanna give other permissions\nI need to make my own folder.\n\n440\n00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:16.200\nSo I'm gonna hit add in\nthe Shared Folder list, and\n\n441\n00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:20.110\nthen I'm just gonna browse to my\ndesktop and find that ringtones folder.\n\n442\n00:21:20.110 --> 00:21:25.170\nSo I'm gonna add that ringtones folder in,\nand it's going to appear in my list.\n\n443\n00:21:25.170 --> 00:21:28.000\nNow I say it's gonna appear in my list,\nsometimes it can take a moment.\n\n444\n00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.600\nIf it does what mine's doing here and\nnot showing up,\n\n445\n00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:33.660\none thing you can do is just quickly\nclose the system preferences, and\n\n446\n00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:36.430\ngo right back into it, so\nthat's what I'm gonna do.\n\n447\n00:21:36.430 --> 00:21:38.740\nLet's see if that takes care of it for me.\n\n448\n00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:40.190\nAnd sure enough, like magic there it is.\n\n449\n00:21:40.190 --> 00:21:43.180\nSo I've got my file sharing,\nthere's my public folder,\n\n450\n00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:46.400\nand now I've got the ring\ntones folder right here.\n\n451\n00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:47.710\nTechnically I'm done.\n\n452\n00:21:47.710 --> 00:21:50.880\nI'm now sharing the ring\ntones folder on the network.\n\n453\n00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:52.520\nBut I might wanna tweak the permissions.\n\n454\n00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:57.330\nAnd if you look at the permissions\nover here you'll see me, staff and\n\n455\n00:21:57.330 --> 00:21:58.660\neveryone, okay.\n\n456\n00:21:58.660 --> 00:21:59.260\nSo who are this?\n\n457\n00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:02.680\nWell me Don Pezett that's the user I'm\nlogin as, so I get read and write.\n\n458\n00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:03.730\nI got full control of this thing.\n\n459\n00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:11.260\nStaff, staff is anyone else that has\na user account on this computer.\n\n460\n00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:14.940\nSo if have other local accounts on\nthis computer there part of staff and\n\n461\n00:22:14.940 --> 00:22:15.640\nthey'll read only.\n\n462\n00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:19.060\nAnd then everyone, that's everybody else.\n\n463\n00:22:19.060 --> 00:22:22.190\nThat's anybody else on the network that\nbrowses to this machine that doesn't login\n\n464\n00:22:22.190 --> 00:22:25.430\nwith the username and password,\nthey'll get read only access also.\n\n465\n00:22:25.430 --> 00:22:26.450\nAnd I might wanna tweak this.\n\n466\n00:22:26.450 --> 00:22:29.770\nI might wanna say, for example, no access.\n\n467\n00:22:29.770 --> 00:22:31.060\nThat everybody gets nothing.\n\n468\n00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:32.540\nYou've got to login.\n\n469\n00:22:32.540 --> 00:22:33.750\nYou have to have a user account.\n\n470\n00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:36.580\nAnd if you have a user account, maybe I\nwant you to be able to read and write.\n\n471\n00:22:36.580 --> 00:22:39.630\nSo I'll come here to staff and\nI'll change that to read and write.\n\n472\n00:22:39.630 --> 00:22:44.310\nSo now, if it's me or anyone else with\na local account on this computer, they can\n\n473\n00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:47.570\nbrowse over the network, and they'll be\nable to read and write to that folder.\n\n474\n00:22:47.570 --> 00:22:49.050\nBut if they come in anonymous,\n\n475\n00:22:49.050 --> 00:22:52.110\nthey're not gonna have any\naccess to that folder at all.\n\n476\n00:22:52.110 --> 00:22:54.320\nThere was one more permission in there,\nwell I guess two more.\n\n477\n00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:58.470\nThere's Read Only, right which makes\nsense, you can only read, you can't write.\n\n478\n00:22:58.470 --> 00:23:01.340\nAnd then there's Write Only Drop Box.\n\n479\n00:23:01.340 --> 00:23:02.450\nThis is a neat one.\n\n480\n00:23:02.450 --> 00:23:07.360\nWrite Only in other words you can\nwrite files but you can't read them.\n\n481\n00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:09.980\nSo if I want Daniel to send me a document\n\n482\n00:23:09.980 --> 00:23:12.870\nI might say hey Daniel just\nput it in my Drop Box, right.\n\n483\n00:23:12.870 --> 00:23:16.120\nHe can browse to my public folder\nthe folder that's already shared out and\n\n484\n00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:18.030\nthere's a folder in there called Drop Box.\n\n485\n00:23:18.030 --> 00:23:20.230\nAnd he can drop a file in there.\n\n486\n00:23:20.230 --> 00:23:24.190\nAnd he's allowed to write it,\nand then I'll get access to it.\n\n487\n00:23:24.190 --> 00:23:27.260\nBut if somebody else were to browse to it,\nthey don't have read.\n\n488\n00:23:27.260 --> 00:23:28.160\nThey can't read the file.\n\n489\n00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:28.960\nEven Daniel can't.\n\n490\n00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:30.680\nOnce he drops the file in there,\nit's gone.\n\n491\n00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:32.930\nHe can't see it anymore\nto get it back out.\n\n492\n00:23:32.930 --> 00:23:33.730\nIt's been delivered to me.\n\n493\n00:23:33.730 --> 00:23:36.470\nSo think of it as like\nthe dropbox at the bank.\n\n494\n00:23:36.470 --> 00:23:40.230\nOnce you drop that deposit slip in\nthere and close the drawer It's gone,\n\n495\n00:23:40.230 --> 00:23:42.690\nyou can't go and\nget that back out again, it's trapped.\n\n496\n00:23:42.690 --> 00:23:44.940\nThat's how the files would be\nwith the Dropbox permission.\n\n497\n00:23:44.940 --> 00:23:47.770\n>> Plus I'm not any of your other\nmaybe sensitive information.\n\n498\n00:23:47.770 --> 00:23:49.240\nJust even file names could be sensitive.\n\n499\n00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:50.330\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n500\n00:23:50.330 --> 00:23:52.470\nPeople get an idea of what you\ngot stored on your computer, so\n\n501\n00:23:52.470 --> 00:23:54.700\nit's a neat little\npermission that's available.\n\n502\n00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:57.610\nBut once those are set,\nnow we're sharing that out.\n\n503\n00:23:57.610 --> 00:23:59.930\nAnd those folders I was\ntalking about if I browse.\n\n504\n00:23:59.930 --> 00:24:01.810\nActually I don't think you\ncan browse to it from here.\n\n505\n00:24:01.810 --> 00:24:03.277\nBut if I go to my go menu up top.\n\n506\n00:24:03.277 --> 00:24:06.714\nYou'll see here in the go menu where\nyou can browse to your home folder.\n\n507\n00:24:06.714 --> 00:24:09.224\nAnd in your home folder.\n\n508\n00:24:09.224 --> 00:24:11.006\nThat's where that public folder is,\n\n509\n00:24:11.006 --> 00:24:13.634\nand if I browse in the public\ntheres the drop box folder.\n\n510\n00:24:13.634 --> 00:24:16.355\nI didn't make those,\nApple creates those by default, and\n\n511\n00:24:16.355 --> 00:24:19.248\nthen got the permission to set on\nthem the way that we want to be.\n\n512\n00:24:19.248 --> 00:24:23.307\nAll right, the other thing is here in\nmy system preference for file sharing,\n\n513\n00:24:23.307 --> 00:24:27.489\nyou got this options button, and right\nhere you can pick how you're gonna share\n\n514\n00:24:27.489 --> 00:24:30.580\nwithout a notice that by default\nto shares via SMB and AFP.\n\n515\n00:24:30.580 --> 00:24:33.598\nSo people using Apple file\nprotocol can browse and connect,\n\n516\n00:24:33.598 --> 00:24:36.571\nand people using Windows\nmachines can browse and connect.\n\n517\n00:24:36.571 --> 00:24:41.294\nSo now that I'm sharing out these\nringtones, if I jump over to another Mac\n\n518\n00:24:41.294 --> 00:24:44.644\nlike this one,\nI should be able to fire up my finder,\n\n519\n00:24:44.644 --> 00:24:49.288\nI should be able to browse and\nsee OS10 client one, and when I connect,\n\n520\n00:24:49.288 --> 00:24:54.700\nI'm gonna connect anonymous, and\nas an anonymous user, I get nothing.\n\n521\n00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:58.160\nBut if I connect as, and\nI provide a user account,\n\n522\n00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:02.820\nI have a user account on that system, so\nI'm gonna provide those credentials, and\n\n523\n00:25:02.820 --> 00:25:07.590\nnow when I connect,\nassuming I get the user name right.\n\n524\n00:25:07.590 --> 00:25:10.187\nWhat should happen [LAUGH] there we go,\n\n525\n00:25:10.187 --> 00:25:13.440\nis that I see the ringtones\nfolder right there.\n\n526\n00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:15.973\nNow, I logged in as an admin, so\nI also see the hard drive and\n\n527\n00:25:15.973 --> 00:25:17.350\nmy own folder and stuff.\n\n528\n00:25:17.350 --> 00:25:21.250\nBut I see the ringtones folder and I can\nbrowse in, and now I can start rocking out\n\n529\n00:25:21.250 --> 00:25:26.190\nto some sweet sweet ringtones that\nbring happiness and joy to the company.\n\n530\n00:25:26.190 --> 00:25:30.810\nNow I can do that from a Mac, and\nI can also do it from a Windows machine.\n\n531\n00:25:30.810 --> 00:25:35.400\nSo on the Windows machine, if I go and\nstart browsing the network, well I may or\n\n532\n00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:38.200\nmay not see it here in the network.\n\n533\n00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:39.810\nLet's see, I'm seeing WIN-CLIENT01.\n\n534\n00:25:39.810 --> 00:25:43.950\nWindows machines dont run Bonjour,\nso they're not as easily able to\n\n535\n00:25:43.950 --> 00:25:47.030\nfind the other clients that are out there\non the network, and it looks like it's not\n\n536\n00:25:47.030 --> 00:25:51.001\nfinding that Mac, but that's no big deal,\nI can always just browse to it manually.\n\n537\n00:25:51.001 --> 00:25:53.640\nWait, that whole Don\nhaving patience thing.\n\n538\n00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:56.731\nSo there, it did find it,\nthere's OSX-CLIENT01,\n\n539\n00:25:56.731 --> 00:26:00.780\nand if I click on that well,\nas an anonymous user,\n\n540\n00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:04.605\nI'm not gonna see much, I need to provide\nsome credentials to connect to it.\n\n541\n00:26:04.605 --> 00:26:06.288\nAnd so, it's gonna try and connect and\n\n542\n00:26:06.288 --> 00:26:09.348\nit should prompt me for a user name and\na password, I'm hoping it does,\n\n543\n00:26:09.348 --> 00:26:11.660\nbecause otherwise I have to\nput it in there manually.\n\n544\n00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:14.070\nSo we'll give it just a moment\nwhile it tries to do that, and\n\n545\n00:26:14.070 --> 00:26:17.140\nit should prompt me for user name and\npassword, and then I can connect.\n\n546\n00:26:17.140 --> 00:26:18.217\nThere we go.\n\n547\n00:26:18.217 --> 00:26:22.682\nSo I'm gonna log in, and we'll get that\nput in, I'll remember my credentials so\n\n548\n00:26:22.682 --> 00:26:25.260\nI don't have to do it again in the future.\n\n549\n00:26:25.260 --> 00:26:28.920\nAnd so now I'm logging in on that Mac, and\nI should be able to see the ringtones and\n\n550\n00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:31.210\nother folders that pop\nup as a result to that.\n\n551\n00:26:31.210 --> 00:26:35.060\nSo I can connect from Macs, and I can\nconnect from Windows assuming, shoot,\n\n552\n00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:36.430\nthe user name is wrong.\n\n553\n00:26:36.430 --> 00:26:40.760\nMy user name is actually dpezet,\nthere we go.\n\n554\n00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:43.745\nThat'll probably make a difference, you\ndo have to have the credentials correct.\n\n555\n00:26:43.745 --> 00:26:45.320\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> In order to connect.\n\n556\n00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:47.810\nNow when that connects,\nthe Windows machine is using SMB,\n\n557\n00:26:47.810 --> 00:26:52.245\nthe Mac is using AFP, but\nthey're both connected to the same folder.\n\n558\n00:26:52.245 --> 00:26:55.010\n[LAUGH] Assuming that I get\nmy credentials correct,\n\n559\n00:26:55.010 --> 00:26:57.280\npretty sure that's the right password.\n\n560\n00:26:57.280 --> 00:26:59.280\nAnd back way over here,\n\n561\n00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:04.150\nif I go into my server options,\nnotice here I've got shared files and\n\n562\n00:27:04.150 --> 00:27:07.830\nfolders using SMB, and my Mac must have\ntimed out so AFP is down to zero, but\n\n563\n00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:11.550\nI can see that one user connectivity SMB,\nthat's that Window's machine connecting.\n\n564\n00:27:11.550 --> 00:27:15.910\nSo that's us being a server\nusing personal file sharing.\n\n565\n00:27:15.910 --> 00:27:18.180\nNow there is another way that we\ncan share files out from a Mac, and\n\n566\n00:27:18.180 --> 00:27:19.760\nthat's if we have the server app.\n\n567\n00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:22.580\nIf you have the server app,\nyou don't want to come in and\n\n568\n00:27:22.580 --> 00:27:25.310\nconfigure file sharing from\nhere in system preferences.\n\n569\n00:27:25.310 --> 00:27:28.730\nInstead, what you want to\ndo is take your server and\n\n570\n00:27:28.730 --> 00:27:32.630\nfire up the server app, and\nyou've got file sharing in the server app.\n\n571\n00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:36.360\nIt's right here under services,\nand if I go under file sharing,\n\n572\n00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:40.500\nyou can see where I can turn that on, and\nright here I can define shared folders for\n\n573\n00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:42.170\npeople to access, all right.\n\n574\n00:27:42.170 --> 00:27:44.660\nSo you can come in and set,\nnow notice it's tied to personal folders.\n\n575\n00:27:44.660 --> 00:27:47.850\nIt actually leverages that on the back\nend, but it's managing it from here.\n\n576\n00:27:47.850 --> 00:27:51.330\nAnd the reason we wanna do this,\nis this is not going to rely on\n\n577\n00:27:51.330 --> 00:27:55.990\nlocal user accounts, it's going to allow\nus to use open directory accounts, right?\n\n578\n00:27:55.990 --> 00:27:57.970\nSo we can have user accounts\nthat are centralized and\n\n579\n00:27:57.970 --> 00:28:01.050\nmanage to be able to access these files,\nfolders, and permissions.\n\n580\n00:28:01.050 --> 00:28:04.960\nAnd so I can come in here, and I can add\nshared folders, and start to share them\n\n581\n00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:08.900\nout, and you'll see I've actually already\ngot this one software folder created.\n\n582\n00:28:08.900 --> 00:28:12.960\nAnd if I edit that folder's permissions,\nyou'll see there's a few more options here\n\n583\n00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:15.360\nthat we didn't have in\npersonal file sharing.\n\n584\n00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:20.585\nSo I do have SMB and AFP, but I also have\nWebDAV if I want to turn it on, right.\n\n585\n00:28:20.585 --> 00:28:24.655\nAnd we can allow encrypted connections,\nso we can get higher security.\n\n586\n00:28:24.655 --> 00:28:27.645\nWe can enable iOS access to devices for\n\n587\n00:28:27.645 --> 00:28:30.585\ndevices that we're managing\nwith the profile manager.\n\n588\n00:28:30.585 --> 00:28:34.305\nWe can get them to where we're able to\nsee the server and connect to files and\n\n589\n00:28:34.305 --> 00:28:35.175\nfolders on it.\n\n590\n00:28:35.175 --> 00:28:38.155\nSo you get some additional\nfunctionality by using the server app.\n\n591\n00:28:38.155 --> 00:28:40.215\nThat might not be something\neverybody out there uses, and\n\n592\n00:28:40.215 --> 00:28:44.390\nit is a little harder to get configured,\nbut, if that's functionality you want,\n\n593\n00:28:44.390 --> 00:28:45.580\nthe server app will give it to you.\n\n594\n00:28:45.580 --> 00:28:49.110\nSo, you can set up a dedicated file\nserver that's running the server app\n\n595\n00:28:49.110 --> 00:28:52.610\nthat has everything configured just the\nway you want it, or, you can use personal\n\n596\n00:28:52.610 --> 00:28:55.900\nfile sharing right there in your own Mac,\nand you don't need any special software.\n\n597\n00:28:55.900 --> 00:29:01.247\n>> Don, is one more robust than the other,\nshould I choose one versus the other or,\n\n598\n00:29:01.247 --> 00:29:04.016\nthey both have their specific purposes?\n\n599\n00:29:04.016 --> 00:29:07.217\n>> When it comes to a file server,\nI always use the server app, right.\n\n600\n00:29:07.217 --> 00:29:08.920\nBecause it is a little more robustness,\nbut\n\n601\n00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:12.141\nthe ability to use those network accounts\nand all, really does make it easier, and\n\n602\n00:29:12.141 --> 00:29:15.340\nyou get that centralized management of it,\nthat's what I like to use.\n\n603\n00:29:15.340 --> 00:29:17.830\nIf it's just quick and\ndirty one user sharing to another though,\n\n604\n00:29:17.830 --> 00:29:22.260\nthen I just use the regular, personal file\nsharing found right in the control panel.\n\n605\n00:29:22.260 --> 00:29:23.570\nSo, that's the way I look at it.\n\n606\n00:29:23.570 --> 00:29:27.270\nIf it's a file server, then use the server\napp, if it's a person's work station,\n\n607\n00:29:27.270 --> 00:29:28.490\njust use personal file sharing.\n\n608\n00:29:28.490 --> 00:29:32.960\n>> Well Don, the staff around here\nwill thank so much for allowing that\n\n609\n00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:36.000\nring tones folder to be opened up,\nwe've been desperately waiting for it.\n\n610\n00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:38.332\nThe musical stylings\nof say Ace of Bass or.\n\n611\n00:29:38.332 --> 00:29:39.590\n[LAUGH]\n>> That's right,\n\n612\n00:29:39.590 --> 00:29:42.785\nif you want to hear a flute rendition\nof any Lynyrd Skynyrd song,\n\n613\n00:29:42.785 --> 00:29:45.701\nyou've got to have some good ringtones and\nwe've got it.\n\n614\n00:29:45.701 --> 00:29:47.230\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Well Don thanks for\n\n615\n00:29:47.230 --> 00:29:47.921\nstopping by.\n\n616\n00:29:47.921 --> 00:29:51.352\nThanks for explaining how to\nboth access shared files, and\n\n617\n00:29:51.352 --> 00:29:53.990\nshare files ourselves from our own Macs.\n\n618\n00:29:53.990 --> 00:29:55.695\nThat is going to be a helpful benefit for\n\n619\n00:29:55.695 --> 00:30:00.380\nany of us who are watching this, and\nuse the Mac in a little more robust way.\n\n620\n00:30:00.380 --> 00:30:04.410\nIs there anything other tips, tricks or\nwords of wisdom otherwise you like to part\n\n621\n00:30:04.410 --> 00:30:05.120\nwith\n>> Yeah,\n\n622\n00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:07.380\nyou might have noticed when I was\nin the sharing system preference,\n\n623\n00:30:07.380 --> 00:30:10.030\nthat there was a lot of other stuff that\nwe could share like sharing printers.\n\n624\n00:30:10.030 --> 00:30:12.740\nWe're gonna take a look at sharing\nprinters in another episode, but\n\n625\n00:30:12.740 --> 00:30:16.570\nsharing your screen, sharing other\nresources, it's all possible.\n\n626\n00:30:16.570 --> 00:30:19.010\nYou can just kinda browse anything\nyou see you've got ton of options.\n\n627\n00:30:19.010 --> 00:30:19.560\n>> All right, Don.\n\n628\n00:30:19.560 --> 00:30:20.620\nWell thanks for stopping by and\n\n629\n00:30:20.620 --> 00:30:23.140\nexplaining us once again,\nthank you guys for

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.342 --> 00:00:17.782\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n4\n00:00:17.782 --> 00:00:22.100\nAnd in today's episode, we're moving\nforward with our, well, what is this show?\n\n5\n00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:25.220\nThis is Mac integration basics,\nthat's right.\n\n6\n00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.970\nI will remember good fellows out there,\n[LAUGH] and joining us in the studio to\n\n7\n00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:31.580\nhelp us in that endeavor is our\ngood friend, Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n8\n00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:32.700\nDon, welcome to the show.\n\n9\n00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.822\n>> Thanks for having me back Daniel, ready\nto jump right back into the world of Mac\n\n10\n00:00:36.822 --> 00:00:41.259\nintegration basics, and in this episode,\nwe are going to stop, collaborate, and\n\n11\n00:00:41.259 --> 00:00:43.389\nlisten as the-\n>> The poet.\n\n12\n00:00:43.389 --> 00:00:45.690\n>> The poet, Vanilla Ice said.\n\n13\n00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.680\nWe're gonna take a look at\ncollaboration software.\n\n14\n00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.630\nAnd what we've got is integrated,\n\n15\n00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:52.875\nI can tell our producer over here\nis giving me the face of bad joke.\n\n16\n00:00:52.875 --> 00:00:53.880\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n17\n00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.850\nSo we're gonna be taking a look\nat how we can get our Mac\n\n18\n00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:59.840\nto play nice with messaging systems.\n\n19\n00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.930\nMessaging systems that may or\nmay not be a part of the Mac world,\n\n20\n00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.450\nrather the Apple environment.\n\n21\n00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:11.130\nSo, if you have the server deployed,\nif you have Mac OS X Server, just a Mac\n\n22\n00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.860\nthat has the server app installed, it\nactually has a mail server built into it.\n\n23\n00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.490\nAnd you can fire that up and you can\nconnect your Mac to it and it runs great.\n\n24\n00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.090\nBut if you do that, you'll be one of\na select few people of these higher planet\n\n25\n00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.020\nwho actually do it, very few people\nmake use of that server app.\n\n26\n00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.630\nAnd the reason is there are so\nmany email service providers in the planet\n\n27\n00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.200\nthat are already doing it on a much,\nmuch larger scale.\n\n28\n00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.660\nSo we just don't see a high adoption\nrate for what's in the server app.\n\n29\n00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:37.399\nWell obviously, if you're running a Mac,\n\n30\n00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:40.885\nit's gonna integrate with the server app\njust fine, that's gonna work, no big deal.\n\n31\n00:01:40.885 --> 00:01:44.482\nAnd in fact, we even saw a little bit of\nthat in the profile manager episodes back\n\n32\n00:01:44.482 --> 00:01:46.320\nin Mac management basics.\n\n33\n00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.110\nBut here,\nwe're gonna take a look at integrating.\n\n34\n00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.440\nIntegrating with other\nsystem that are out there.\n\n35\n00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.390\nSo let's say you choose not\nto go with the server app.\n\n36\n00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.759\nMaybe you do Google Apps for\nBusiness, or maybe you do Yahoo!\n\n37\n00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:01.930\nMail for your company, or God forbid, AOL.\n\n38\n00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:04.050\nRight, maybe you do AOL.\n\n39\n00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:07.210\nWell, you've got software on your Mac.\n\n40\n00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:11.770\nYou've got a mail client, a contacts\nclient, a calendar client that can all\n\n41\n00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:16.520\nintegrate with these external systems so\nyou don't have to set up your own server.\n\n42\n00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.790\nAnd I'll tell you,\nI'm a network engineer by trade,\n\n43\n00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.280\nI've been working on servers\nlike these for a long time, and\n\n44\n00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.180\nI used to specialize in doing\nemail server migrations.\n\n45\n00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.960\nI've done hundreds of them,\nit's something that I've worked in a lot.\n\n46\n00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:32.840\nBut given the choice, I don't like to\nstand up my own mail server because\n\n47\n00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.340\nI don't wanna have to back it up,\n\n48\n00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.450\nI don't wanna have to restore\nit if there's a failure.\n\n49\n00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:40.750\nI don't wanna worry about that stuff, I've\ngot too much stuff on my plate already.\n\n50\n00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.780\nSo any chance where I can get that hosted\nby somebody else, I typically do that.\n\n51\n00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.290\nAnd fortunately,\nwe're set up to be able to handle it.\n\n52\n00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.991\nSo in this episode, we're gonna\ntake a look at that mail client and\n\n53\n00:02:48.991 --> 00:02:51.079\nhow we can get it connected\nto those other parties.\n\n54\n00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:54.120\nNow, when it comes to\nconnecting to other systems,\n\n55\n00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.024\nApple's already built\nsome functionality in for\n\n56\n00:02:57.024 --> 00:03:01.120\nus that makes it super easy to integrate\nand let me show you what I mean.\n\n57\n00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.221\nSo I've got a El Capitan system here\nthat I haven't messed with, right.\n\n58\n00:03:05.221 --> 00:03:08.860\nI installed El Capitan, and\nI set up a user account for myself.\n\n59\n00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.505\nSo I'm logged in as Don Pezet and\nhere I am on this base install.\n\n60\n00:03:12.505 --> 00:03:15.705\nAnd right down here in my dock,\nI'll see the Mail app.\n\n61\n00:03:15.705 --> 00:03:19.945\nRight, so it's just, people used to\ncall it Apple Mail or Mail.app, or\n\n62\n00:03:19.945 --> 00:03:23.925\nwhatever you wanna call it, but it's\njust a mail app that's a part of Mac OS.\n\n63\n00:03:23.925 --> 00:03:27.703\nAnd Apple really made some big\nupgrades to this back in Yosemite and\n\n64\n00:03:27.703 --> 00:03:30.069\nin El Capitan that's kind of carried on.\n\n65\n00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:31.964\nThere's some really neat\npreview functionality and\n\n66\n00:03:31.964 --> 00:03:33.900\nstuff we didn't have in\nthe old mail client.\n\n67\n00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.880\nSo some people who maybe hated the mail\nclient in the past, you might want to take\n\n68\n00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.280\na look at it again because they\nhave added some new features to it,\n\n69\n00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:41.940\nso it's kinda nice.\n\n70\n00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.650\nBut when you launch it,\nit's gonna fire up and\n\n71\n00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:47.550\nyou don't have any email\naccounts attached to it.\n\n72\n00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:51.640\nAnd so the first thing it's gonna do\nis say Choose a Mail account provider.\n\n73\n00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:53.300\nWell, let's take a look at this list.\n\n74\n00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.470\nNumber one, iCloud, right?\n\n75\n00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.820\nApple wants you to use iCloud for\nall your services.\n\n76\n00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:59.970\nThey provide you email,\ncontacts, calendaring,\n\n77\n00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:04.270\nall of the other various things like file\nstorage, and bookmark synchronization and\n\n78\n00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:05.930\nall that through iCloud.\n\n79\n00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:08.980\nSo if we choose that, obviously, we're\ngonna get the best compatibility, and\n\n80\n00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.070\nour data's gonna be synchronized\nacross all of our Macs,\n\n81\n00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:13.650\nthat's the way we wanna go, right?\n\n82\n00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:16.090\nBut that may not be what you have.\n\n83\n00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:19.530\nApple has really stayed away\nfrom the enterprise space.\n\n84\n00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:22.480\nSo if you have a business\nwith 300 employees,\n\n85\n00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:25.860\nthere's not really a great way\nto set up 300 people in iCloud.\n\n86\n00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:29.050\nThey just don't have that yet, they\nprobably will one day, but as of today,\n\n87\n00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:30.760\nthere's just really not\na great way to do it.\n\n88\n00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:34.140\nSo instead, you might say, you know what,\nI've got 300 employees, let me go and\n\n89\n00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:38.850\nset up with Microsoft Exchange,\nor Google Apps, or Yahoo!\n\n90\n00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:42.160\nor AOL, or somebody else, right?\n\n91\n00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.910\nAnd as I look at this list,\nthere's something that's missing.\n\n92\n00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:47.980\nRemember I mentioned that server app\nthat's part of that OS X Server,\n\n93\n00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:49.320\nit's not on the list.\n\n94\n00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:52.120\nIf you want to connect that,\nyou gotta choose other mail account\n\n95\n00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:54.890\neven though it's Apple's own product,\nwe have to go at it that way.\n\n96\n00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:58.230\nAnd the reason is almost every mail server\n\n97\n00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:00.860\nout there has a couple of common\nprotocols you'll see a lot.\n\n98\n00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:03.420\nAnd you'll need to remember these for\nthe exam, this is important.\n\n99\n00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:05.150\nSo when we connect to a mail server,\n\n100\n00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:07.650\nthere's three protocols\nthat come into play.\n\n101\n00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:12.720\nThere's SMTP, POP3, and IMAP4, all right?\n\n102\n00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:17.960\nSMTP is the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol\nand it's what we use for sending emails.\n\n103\n00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:23.190\nIt is the de facto standards for\nsending emails so everybody uses it.\n\n104\n00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:30.300\nIf you're using Google Apps, Yahoo!, AOL,\nOffice 365, Exchange, they all use SMTP.\n\n105\n00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:34.780\nAnd so when we send email,\nthat's a really, really common protocol.\n\n106\n00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:36.660\nWhen we receive email, on the other hand,\n\n107\n00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:39.050\nis when things start\nto get a little weird.\n\n108\n00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:43.150\niCloud and Exchange, they kind of have\ntheir own little protocols they used\n\n109\n00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:45.350\nwhich, iCloud is actually based on IMAP,\nbut\n\n110\n00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:47.750\nExchange is based on something\ncompletely different.\n\n111\n00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:51.240\nThey're own little RPC structure they\nuse for communicating, it's very,\n\n112\n00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:52.450\nvery different.\n\n113\n00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:54.460\nBut Google, Yahoo!, AOL,\n\n114\n00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:59.660\nif I wanna connect to them, I can use\none of two very standard protocols.\n\n115\n00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:03.280\nThere's POP3 which is\nthe Post Office Protocol version three,\n\n116\n00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:04.645\nwe don't care about the version 3 part.\n\n117\n00:06:04.645 --> 00:06:07.680\nNobody runs version one and\ntwo, they died out in the 80s.\n\n118\n00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:11.990\nSo POP3, the Post Office Protocol,\nor IMAP4,\n\n119\n00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:16.650\nwhich is the Internet message and\naddressing protocol or something.\n\n120\n00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:18.880\nI always forget what the A stands for.\n\n121\n00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:20.500\nBut IMAP4 is the other one.\n\n122\n00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:24.848\nNow IMAP4 is newer and\nmore feature rich than POP3.\n\n123\n00:06:24.848 --> 00:06:28.240\nAnd so IMAP4 is the one you're normally\ngonna use out there in the real world.\n\n124\n00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:29.750\nBut on the exam, you could see both so\n\n125\n00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:33.080\nthat's why I wanna bring them both up,\nPOP3 and IMAP4.\n\n126\n00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:35.670\nNow, both of them,\nwhat you receive in your email,\n\n127\n00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:39.462\nyou can check your email from the server\nbut they function a little bit different.\n\n128\n00:06:39.462 --> 00:06:43.290\nSo, POP3 for example, what it does\nis it reaches out to the server and\n\n129\n00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:46.520\nit says, I've got five new emails,\nlet me download the emails and\n\n130\n00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:48.526\ndelete them from the server, okay.\n\n131\n00:06:48.526 --> 00:06:51.260\nSo, it downloads the emails and then\nremoves them from the server which means\n\n132\n00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:55.490\nif I have more than one client, what if I\nhave an iPhone, and iPad, and a Mac Book.\n\n133\n00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:59.840\nWhen the Mac Book reaches out and\ndownloads the five emails, the iPhone and\n\n134\n00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:02.468\nthe iPad don't see them anymore,\nthey're gone, right.\n\n135\n00:07:02.468 --> 00:07:05.130\nSo POP3 is not very friendly\nwhen you have multiple devices,\n\n136\n00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:06.390\nit makes things difficult.\n\n137\n00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:09.460\nNow they've changed it a little\nbit over the years to say like\n\n138\n00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:11.860\ndownload the emails but\nleave them on the server.\n\n139\n00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:14.880\nBut then we still have other problems of\nlike whether they get marked read and so\n\n140\n00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:17.177\non, so\nit's various problems you have with POP3.\n\n141\n00:07:17.177 --> 00:07:22.070\nBut the biggest problem with POP3 is that\nit doesn't support subfolders, right.\n\n142\n00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:25.710\nIf you're one of those people where\nyour mailbox is just one big fat folder,\n\n143\n00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:29.930\nan inbox and there's all of your email,\nwell then POP3 might be fine for you.\n\n144\n00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:32.500\nBut if you're like me,\nI've got tons of subfolders.\n\n145\n00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:34.390\nAll these little folders\nwhere I organize my email and\n\n146\n00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:36.570\nstuff when I keep it,\nit's almost like a filing system.\n\n147\n00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:37.946\nVery sick, sad file system.\n\n148\n00:07:37.946 --> 00:07:38.929\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But\n\n149\n00:07:38.929 --> 00:07:42.700\nwhere I've got that data I want to\nrefer to and POP3 won't let me do that.\n\n150\n00:07:43.785 --> 00:07:46.633\nIMAP4 on the other hand,\nIMAP4 lets you have subfolders and\n\n151\n00:07:46.633 --> 00:07:49.886\nit's designed to be able to support\nmore than one client connecting.\n\n152\n00:07:49.886 --> 00:07:53.726\nSo they can see how I read this email\non my iPhone so it's mark it as read\n\n153\n00:07:53.726 --> 00:07:58.115\non my iPad and on my desktop too, so\nit's consistent across the environment.\n\n154\n00:07:58.115 --> 00:08:02.221\nSo IMAP4 is more feature rich and it is\nwhat you're gonna use in the real world\n\n155\n00:08:02.221 --> 00:08:05.712\nBut on the exam we need to know both\ncuz we do have support for both.\n\n156\n00:08:05.712 --> 00:08:08.150\nWell, if you stand up\nyour own mail server.\n\n157\n00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:09.190\nLet me just show you this real quick.\n\n158\n00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:11.470\nIf I whip over to a server, right.\n\n159\n00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:14.760\nSo here's an OSX box that's\nrunning the server app.\n\n160\n00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:17.093\nAnd if I look I've got\na mail service right here.\n\n161\n00:08:17.093 --> 00:08:20.890\nI can choose mail and\nI can come in here and turn it on, okay?\n\n162\n00:08:20.890 --> 00:08:26.820\nAnd if I turn it on, it's gonna fire up,\nand I'm now running a mail server.\n\n163\n00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:31.270\nAnd what I'm actually running in\nthe background is, well, four or\n\n164\n00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:33.420\nfive different services.\n\n165\n00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:36.600\nI'm running a post fix email server.\n\n166\n00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:39.640\nI'm running send mail as an SMTP server.\n\n167\n00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:45.000\nI'm running Dovecot,\nwhich is a POP3 and IMAP server, right.\n\n168\n00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.290\nSo it's actually building all\nthat support in the background,\n\n169\n00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:50.170\nto set up a mail environment for me.\n\n170\n00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:54.620\nBut at the end of the day when I\nconnect to it, POP3, IMAP4, SMTP.\n\n171\n00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:57.160\nThere's three standard protocols.\n\n172\n00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:00.100\nAnd so\nback here when I fire up my mail client.\n\n173\n00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:02.770\nIf I say I'm connecting to Google,\nor Yahoo, or\n\n174\n00:09:02.770 --> 00:09:06.710\nAOL, it really is gonna be POP3 or\nIMAP4, whatever.\n\n175\n00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:10.160\nSo I could set them up\nusing these easy wizards,\n\n176\n00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:13.070\nwhere Apple's already plugged\nin all the server names for me.\n\n177\n00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:14.810\nOr I can choose Other Mail Account.\n\n178\n00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:18.840\nAnd when I choose Other Mail Account,\nI need to provide the data.\n\n179\n00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:23.150\nI can hit continue, and now it's gonna ask\nme to put in my email address and so on.\n\n180\n00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:26.514\nNow the reason it's asking for the email\naddress, is that it's gonna try and\n\n181\n00:09:26.514 --> 00:09:28.655\nautomatically figure out\nmy account settings.\n\n182\n00:09:28.655 --> 00:09:35.493\nSo for example, if I were to put in here,\nlet's say I was dpezet@yahoo.com right?\n\n183\n00:09:35.493 --> 00:09:39.153\nI don't actually have that email address,\nso who knows who that is.\n\n184\n00:09:39.153 --> 00:09:39.960\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But if I put that in there\n\n185\n00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:40.820\n>> It's going to look at it and\n\n186\n00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:42.400\nsay, you're trying to connect to Yahoo.\n\n187\n00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:46.070\nI know what email servers you need there,\nand if you give me your password\n\n188\n00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:48.645\nright here then I'll be able\nto connect to that no problem.\n\n189\n00:09:48.645 --> 00:09:53.160\nSo it's gonna try and figure that out for\nus, but if it can't figure it out,\n\n190\n00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:56.790\nthen we'll have to give it the additional\ninformation to let it know.\n\n191\n00:09:56.790 --> 00:10:01.125\nSo maybe I wanna be John Doe,\nso I'll just put in John Doe.\n\n192\n00:10:01.125 --> 00:10:03.020\n[LAUGH] John Don.\n\n193\n00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:05.500\nJohn Doe and I'll be john@itpro.tv and\n\n194\n00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:08.030\nI'll put in a password of\nwhatever my password is.\n\n195\n00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:09.950\nWhat is my password actually?\n\n196\n00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:10.490\nThere we go.\n\n197\n00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:13.680\nSo I'll put in a password for\nthis account.\n\n198\n00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:16.370\nThere we go.\n\n199\n00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:17.290\nAnd I'll choose to sign in.\n\n200\n00:10:17.290 --> 00:10:19.620\nNow when it goes to sign in,\nwhat's it gonna do?\n\n201\n00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:23.010\nWell, it's gonna try and\nconnect to the server for ITProTV.\n\n202\n00:10:23.010 --> 00:10:28.770\nAnd if it can figure out the server,\nit'll automatically fill in the details.\n\n203\n00:10:28.770 --> 00:10:29.840\nBut in my case it failed.\n\n204\n00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:33.550\nIt didn't figure out the server, and\nnow I have to tell it how do I connect.\n\n205\n00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:37.440\nWhat's my username, what's my password,\nand what's the account type?\n\n206\n00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:42.232\nAnd so I'm gonna put in my username for\nthis person is actually his email address.\n\n207\n00:10:42.232 --> 00:10:46.810\nThe password is what I put in\na minute ago, and then account type.\n\n208\n00:10:46.810 --> 00:10:50.180\nI can drop that box down, and\nyou can see IMAP and POP.\n\n209\n00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:53.226\nNow it doesn't say POP3 and IMAP4,\nit just says IMAP and POP, but\n\n210\n00:10:53.226 --> 00:10:54.950\nit is version three and version four.\n\n211\n00:10:54.950 --> 00:10:56.420\nSo I need to tell it which kind.\n\n212\n00:10:56.420 --> 00:10:59.160\nThis is important cuz I can't\nreally change it later.\n\n213\n00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:00.350\nIf I picked the wrong one here,\n\n214\n00:11:00.350 --> 00:11:03.130\nI've gotta delete the account and\nre-add it in again, right?\n\n215\n00:11:03.130 --> 00:11:07.230\nSo if I'm connecting up to an external\nserver, I need to call my admins and say,\n\n216\n00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:09.020\nwhich one do you guys support?\n\n217\n00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:11.380\nDo you do IMAP or POP or do you do both?\n\n218\n00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:12.980\nIf they do both, I wanna pick IMAP,\n\n219\n00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:15.620\ncuz that's the one that's gonna\ngive me the best functionality.\n\n220\n00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:19.290\nBut if they only support POP, that's fine,\nI can choose it right here and pick it.\n\n221\n00:11:19.290 --> 00:11:23.680\nNow both of these are incoming\nemail protocols, right?\n\n222\n00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:26.100\nThis is how I receive my email.\n\n223\n00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:29.810\nBut in the send world, you only send with\nSMTP, so that's why I've only got this\n\n224\n00:11:29.810 --> 00:11:33.153\none drop down box and it asks for\nan incoming and an outgoing mail server.\n\n225\n00:11:33.153 --> 00:11:34.680\nFor the outgoing mail server,\n\n226\n00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:38.157\nit doesn't ask for a protocol because\nit knows I'm going to use SMTP.\n\n227\n00:11:38.157 --> 00:11:40.827\nAnd then I can specify\nthis information now.\n\n228\n00:11:40.827 --> 00:11:44.340\nEven this might not be enough.\n\n229\n00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:48.270\nIt might still fail, and the reason\nis in addition to a server name,\n\n230\n00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:51.100\nsometimes you'll have a custom\nport number to specify.\n\n231\n00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:52.250\nSo this might still fail and\n\n232\n00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:54.800\nI'll show you guys how to fix\nthat after it's done failing.\n\n233\n00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:56.390\nLet's see, maybe it won't.\n\n234\n00:11:56.390 --> 00:12:01.280\nSo for my incoming server,\nI'm gonna put, I'm using Office 365 so\n\n235\n00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:04.838\nI'll put outlook.office365.com,\n\n236\n00:12:04.838 --> 00:12:08.990\nand that's Microsoft's cloud\nhosted office solution.\n\n237\n00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:11.240\nIt's kinda like iCloud but\nMicrosoft's version of it.\n\n238\n00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:15.080\nSo I'm connecting to Microsoft's servers,\nand I'm gonna use IMAP to do it.\n\n239\n00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:18.850\nAnd for outgoing email,\nnow I need my SMTP server and for\n\n240\n00:12:18.850 --> 00:12:24.360\nthat one it is smtp.office365.com.\n\n241\n00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:26.640\nIt'll usually be two different servers.\n\n242\n00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:28.390\nIt could be the same server name, though.\n\n243\n00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:32.690\nSome systems do that, but\noftentimes it'll be separate ones.\n\n244\n00:12:32.690 --> 00:12:34.290\nSo I'm gonna choose those,\nand I'll hit sign in, and\n\n245\n00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:36.750\nwe'll see if that works out for us.\n\n246\n00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:39.570\nLet's give that a go, and\nwe'll see if it fails.\n\n247\n00:12:39.570 --> 00:12:44.050\nNow, what I'm setting up here is my email,\nokay?\n\n248\n00:12:44.050 --> 00:12:45.300\nAnd so it's gonna reach out, and\n\n249\n00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:49.060\nit's gonna connect to that system,\nand it's setting up email.\n\n250\n00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:52.170\nWell, it's also setting up Notes.\n\n251\n00:12:52.170 --> 00:12:53.360\nNow what are Notes?\n\n252\n00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:55.085\nNotes are almost like emails to myself.\n\n253\n00:12:55.085 --> 00:12:58.321\nAnd in IMAP4, a note is really\njust a folder in your inbox, and\n\n254\n00:12:58.321 --> 00:13:01.447\nit sticks these little emails\nto yourself to serve as notes.\n\n255\n00:13:01.447 --> 00:13:04.942\nBut on your Mac, we see them down\nin our Notes app down here, so\n\n256\n00:13:04.942 --> 00:13:09.600\nany time I make a note, it's actually\ngetting stuffed into my mailbox too.\n\n257\n00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:14.590\nThat's awesome, because if I have a laptop\nand a desktop, and an iPad and an iPhone,\n\n258\n00:13:14.590 --> 00:13:18.000\nI can make a note to myself on one, and\nI'll see the notes on all the other.\n\n259\n00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.360\nAnd in the background, it's really just\nhappening through the mail server.\n\n260\n00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:23.710\nI don't realize that,\nit's hidden from me right, it's magic.\n\n261\n00:13:23.710 --> 00:13:26.350\nBut in the end of the day it is just\nkinda converting it to an email.\n\n262\n00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:30.840\nSo I'm gonna go and hit done on that, and\nit's gonna connect up to the mailbox.\n\n263\n00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:33.830\nNow, I've got zero messages right now.\n\n264\n00:13:33.830 --> 00:13:37.230\nIt's reaching out to the server and it's\ndownloading the messages that I've got.\n\n265\n00:13:37.230 --> 00:13:39.800\nNow IMAP leaves the emails\nup on the server too.\n\n266\n00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:42.190\nAnd here we go, I can see I've\ngot an email from Don Pezet.\n\n267\n00:13:42.190 --> 00:13:44.970\nI'm logged in as John Doe,\na little schizophrenic today.\n\n268\n00:13:44.970 --> 00:13:47.510\nAnd so I've got this welcome\nto the company email, right.\n\n269\n00:13:47.510 --> 00:13:49.990\nAnd so we can see welcome.\n\n270\n00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:53.470\nNow notice how when I clicked on it, it\ntook a moment for the message to appear.\n\n271\n00:13:53.470 --> 00:13:56.190\nIMAP downloads the headers by default.\n\n272\n00:13:56.190 --> 00:13:59.090\nAnd it's only when you click on the email\nthat it then goes to download the rest of\n\n273\n00:13:59.090 --> 00:14:00.910\nthe message body to have it available.\n\n274\n00:14:00.910 --> 00:14:03.765\nAnd so now I can read the message and\nhello John, welcome to the company.\n\n275\n00:14:03.765 --> 00:14:06.810\nI'm sure you will be a valuable\nasset unlike Daniel Lowry.\n\n276\n00:14:06.810 --> 00:14:07.474\nSo-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n277\n00:14:07.474 --> 00:14:08.439\n>> [LAUGH] You know,\n\n278\n00:14:08.439 --> 00:14:11.090\nthis is how I get set up for\nthe show, Daniel.\n\n279\n00:14:11.090 --> 00:14:12.470\n>> Yeah. [LAUGH] >> So there we go.\n\n280\n00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:14.920\nSo I've got my email, I'm able to see it.\n\n281\n00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:17.440\nIt doesn't matter that I'm\nconnected to Microsoft's servers.\n\n282\n00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:22.890\nOr Yahoo, or AOL, or one of those guys,\nit's just POP3 or IMAP4 or SMTP.\n\n283\n00:14:22.890 --> 00:14:26.570\nThey're standard protocols, so\nwe can connect to just about any system.\n\n284\n00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:29.222\nAnd if I need to modify\nthis after the fact,\n\n285\n00:14:29.222 --> 00:14:31.220\nlet's say it failed to connect, right?\n\n286\n00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:33.280\nI might need to adjust some port numbers.\n\n287\n00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:36.900\nAnd so you can go up to your Mail\nmenu up here and go to Accounts.\n\n288\n00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:39.140\nYou got Preferences,\nyou can get that way too.\n\n289\n00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:44.660\nBut if I go to Mail > Accounts, then it's\ngonna launch my system preferences, and\n\n290\n00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:49.100\nI'll see mail and notes for IT pro right\nhere and I can start to customize things.\n\n291\n00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:55.280\nI can also go up to Mail > Preferences,\nand in the preferences you've\n\n292\n00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:58.840\ngot an accounts tab right here which is\nshowing basically the same information.\n\n293\n00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:01.490\nAnd so we can look in here and\nsee some basic data.\n\n294\n00:15:01.490 --> 00:15:06.220\nNow, I'm seeing my account type is IMAP,\nand see how it won't let me change it.\n\n295\n00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:08.940\nIf I wanna change to POP, I've gotta\ndelete it and re-add it, they're so\n\n296\n00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:10.550\ndifferent, the two protocols are so\ndifferent,\n\n297\n00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:12.360\nyou can't just flip between one and\nthe other.\n\n298\n00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:16.300\nAll right, but I wanted to point out this\nAdvanced tab, because under Advanced,\n\n299\n00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:21.390\nhere's where we can specify\na port number for communicating.\n\n300\n00:15:21.390 --> 00:15:25.012\nAnd see how mine's defaulted to\nport 143 and it's using SSL?\n\n301\n00:15:25.012 --> 00:15:28.867\nWell, some systems don't use 143 for IMAP.\n\n302\n00:15:28.867 --> 00:15:32.489\nSome of them use a different port like 99,\nwhat's the other one?\n\n303\n00:15:32.489 --> 00:15:35.583\nIt's 993, so some might use 993 and\nI might have to come in and\n\n304\n00:15:35.583 --> 00:15:38.900\nchange that to match,\notherwise I won't be able to connect.\n\n305\n00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:42.430\nSo those port numbers are important,\nno pun intended.\n\n306\n00:15:42.430 --> 00:15:45.970\nBut you can see them right here,\nI just went to, from the mail client,\n\n307\n00:15:45.970 --> 00:15:50.390\nI went to Mail > Preferences, and then\nI went to the Account tab to get that.\n\n308\n00:15:50.390 --> 00:15:54.154\nIf you go the other way,\nif you go into System Preferences,\n\n309\n00:15:54.154 --> 00:15:58.316\ninside of System Preferences you\ncan go into internet accounts.\n\n310\n00:15:58.316 --> 00:16:00.785\nAnd under internet accounts, we'll see,\n\n311\n00:16:00.785 --> 00:16:03.664\nthere's that ITPro that I\njust set up a minute ago.\n\n312\n00:16:03.664 --> 00:16:05.568\nAnd I can go to Advanced.\n\n313\n00:16:05.568 --> 00:16:08.254\nAnd when I got into Advanced there,\nI can see the hostname, but\n\n314\n00:16:08.254 --> 00:16:09.938\nsee how I can't change my port number?\n\n315\n00:16:09.938 --> 00:16:11.738\nIt's not that terribly Advanced, is it?\n\n316\n00:16:11.738 --> 00:16:13.618\nIt's pretty limited when you go this way.\n\n317\n00:16:13.618 --> 00:16:18.138\nSo, going to it through the mail client\ngives us a little bit more functionality.\n\n318\n00:16:18.138 --> 00:16:20.678\nSo that's basically, getting that setup.\n\n319\n00:16:20.678 --> 00:16:25.138\nNow I know what you're thinking and I\nactually don't, but one of the things that\n\n320\n00:16:25.138 --> 00:16:29.018\nyou might be thinking is why can I\nconfigure the account in two places?\n\n321\n00:16:29.018 --> 00:16:33.798\nWhy do I have it in the Mail app,\nas well as in the system preferences?\n\n322\n00:16:33.798 --> 00:16:35.358\nWhy is it in two places?\n\n323\n00:16:35.358 --> 00:16:38.938\nAnd the answer,\nit actually stems based on what you want.\n\n324\n00:16:38.938 --> 00:16:40.498\nI just setup a mail account.\n\n325\n00:16:40.498 --> 00:16:44.538\nIt's really just mail, but\nit's also notes, isn't it?\n\n326\n00:16:44.538 --> 00:16:45.958\nIt's more than one service.\n\n327\n00:16:45.958 --> 00:16:48.778\nWhen we talk about collaboration,\nthere's a lot of services involved.\n\n328\n00:16:48.778 --> 00:16:50.278\nWe've got mail.\n\n329\n00:16:50.278 --> 00:16:51.438\nWe've got notes.\n\n330\n00:16:51.438 --> 00:16:53.038\nWe've got calendars.\n\n331\n00:16:53.038 --> 00:16:54.518\nWe've got contacts.\n\n332\n00:16:54.518 --> 00:16:59.482\nYou've got other resources that\nyou can exchange as a part of\n\n333\n00:16:59.482 --> 00:17:03.678\nthat ecosystem and\nwhat I just setup was just mail.\n\n334\n00:17:03.678 --> 00:17:07.655\nAnd if you're just setting up mail, you\ncan do it right through the mail app, but\n\n335\n00:17:07.655 --> 00:17:09.308\nwhat if I wanna setup a calendar?\n\n336\n00:17:09.308 --> 00:17:10.728\nI've got a calendar app.\n\n337\n00:17:10.728 --> 00:17:11.968\nWhat if I wanna setup contacts?\n\n338\n00:17:11.968 --> 00:17:12.688\nI've got a contacts app.\n\n339\n00:17:12.688 --> 00:17:17.368\nI've got these separate apps and\neach one has their own preferences.\n\n340\n00:17:17.368 --> 00:17:21.236\nAnd so what Apple did is they said, look,\nif you've got an account that provides all\n\n341\n00:17:21.236 --> 00:17:23.918\nthese services,\nyou can set it up in system preferences.\n\n342\n00:17:23.918 --> 00:17:27.318\nAnd in system preferences, they've\nadded this internet accounts option.\n\n343\n00:17:27.318 --> 00:17:29.318\nAnd if we dive into that,\nhere I'll just pull it up real quick.\n\n344\n00:17:29.318 --> 00:17:33.884\nIf I dive into it, it's gonna offer for\nme to add more accounts and\n\n345\n00:17:33.884 --> 00:17:37.138\nthey can do a lot more then just mail and\nnotes.\n\n346\n00:17:37.138 --> 00:17:39.418\nAnd this one just does mail,\ncuz that's all I added.\n\n347\n00:17:39.418 --> 00:17:44.064\nBut if you look at some of the other ones\nthat were in that list, we got iCloud,\n\n348\n00:17:44.064 --> 00:17:46.798\nExchange, Google, Twitter and Facebook.\n\n349\n00:17:46.798 --> 00:17:50.500\nI didn't see that in the Mail app,\nbecause Twitter and\n\n350\n00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:54.378\nFacebook aren't email, but\nYahoo and AOL are, Vimeo.\n\n351\n00:17:54.378 --> 00:17:56.378\nVimeo is videos.\n\n352\n00:17:56.378 --> 00:18:00.638\nThese are other internet services that I\ncan integrate with that aren't email, but\n\n353\n00:18:00.638 --> 00:18:01.958\nprovide other services.\n\n354\n00:18:01.958 --> 00:18:06.226\nAnd so other apps like if I fire up iMovie\nand I start editing a movie, if I've got\n\n355\n00:18:06.226 --> 00:18:10.718\na Vimeo account added, I can publish right\nto Vimeo, right from inside if iMovie.\n\n356\n00:18:10.718 --> 00:18:14.669\nI'm integrated with that service,\ngot nothing to do with email and\n\n357\n00:18:14.669 --> 00:18:18.623\nsome of these services provide a lot\nof different functionality and\n\n358\n00:18:18.623 --> 00:18:23.158\nthe one they call out on the exam is\nthis one right here, Microsoft Exchange.\n\n359\n00:18:23.158 --> 00:18:27.830\nMicrosoft Exchange is Microsoft's\ncollaboration server and whether you like\n\n360\n00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:32.578\nor hate Microsoft, they really do have\nthe best email server that's out there.\n\n361\n00:18:32.578 --> 00:18:36.264\nAll of the email servers that are\navailable in the Unix world, Linux world,\n\n362\n00:18:36.264 --> 00:18:38.118\nMac world, they're all very basic.\n\n363\n00:18:38.118 --> 00:18:40.201\nThey have a basic set of functionality,\nbut\n\n364\n00:18:40.201 --> 00:18:42.238\nMicrosoft Exchange is extremely robust.\n\n365\n00:18:42.238 --> 00:18:43.298\nIt does so much.\n\n366\n00:18:43.298 --> 00:18:45.638\nIt does calendaring, contacts.\n\n367\n00:18:45.638 --> 00:18:48.394\nYou can do messaging through it,\nyou can do a ton of things and\n\n368\n00:18:48.394 --> 00:18:50.458\nApple's catching up with that with iCloud.\n\n369\n00:18:50.458 --> 00:18:53.689\nICloud is really close to Exchange,\nbut it's not ready for\n\n370\n00:18:53.689 --> 00:18:55.378\ncorporate environments yet.\n\n371\n00:18:55.378 --> 00:18:57.818\nMicrosoft Exchange is and so\nit's very widely deployed.\n\n372\n00:18:57.818 --> 00:18:58.618\nYou see it all over the place.\n\n373\n00:18:58.618 --> 00:19:01.339\nHeck, you can't turn on the news\ntoday without hearing about\n\n374\n00:19:01.339 --> 00:19:05.107\nHillary Clinton's Exchange server and that\nstems from, hey, the US Government had\n\n375\n00:19:05.107 --> 00:19:08.058\na set of mail servers, but\nshe wanted those features in Exchange.\n\n376\n00:19:08.058 --> 00:19:08.737\nThat's how good,\n\n377\n00:19:08.737 --> 00:19:11.078\nshe was willing to jeopardize her\npresidential campaign for it.\n\n378\n00:19:11.078 --> 00:19:12.178\nThat's how good it is.\n\n379\n00:19:12.178 --> 00:19:15.398\nSo even if you hate Microsoft,\nExchange is a really great product.\n\n380\n00:19:15.398 --> 00:19:19.838\nSo if I wanna connect to it I'm connecting\nto a heck of a lot more than email.\n\n381\n00:19:19.838 --> 00:19:21.678\nI'm connecting to a lot of other things.\n\n382\n00:19:21.678 --> 00:19:24.798\nSo let's see that, I'm gonna take\nold ITPro here and just delete it.\n\n383\n00:19:24.798 --> 00:19:26.608\nSo, I'm gonna get rid of that account and\n\n384\n00:19:26.608 --> 00:19:29.158\nI probably should have gotten\nout of my mail client first.\n\n385\n00:19:29.158 --> 00:19:30.958\nLet me quickly get out of mail.\n\n386\n00:19:30.958 --> 00:19:33.178\nSo, I've just deleted\nthat internet account.\n\n387\n00:19:33.178 --> 00:19:36.272\nAnd if I fire up mail now,\nI might have confused it.\n\n388\n00:19:36.272 --> 00:19:37.158\nNo, good.\n\n389\n00:19:37.158 --> 00:19:40.770\nSo it's prompting this and see how I\ncan connect to exchange for email, but\n\n390\n00:19:40.770 --> 00:19:44.551\nI'm gonna quit out of that and I'm gonna\ngo back into my system preferences and\n\n391\n00:19:44.551 --> 00:19:47.958\ngo back into internet accounts and\nI'm gonna add Exchange this time.\n\n392\n00:19:47.958 --> 00:19:52.546\nAnd when I add Exchange,\nI can punch in that I'm John Doe.\n\n393\n00:19:52.546 --> 00:19:55.566\nJohn@itpro.tv and\nI'm gonna punch in my password.\n\n394\n00:19:55.566 --> 00:19:59.431\nNow remember earlier when\nI punched in this data,\n\n395\n00:19:59.431 --> 00:20:04.226\nit tried to automatically\nconfigure my server and it failed.\n\n396\n00:20:04.226 --> 00:20:07.134\nBut this time, it knows that\nI'm running Microsoft Exchange.\n\n397\n00:20:07.134 --> 00:20:10.590\nIt knows some things to look at and\nit may actually be able to autodetect it\n\n398\n00:20:10.590 --> 00:20:13.494\nthis time even though it failed\nbefore when I was doing IMAP.\n\n399\n00:20:13.494 --> 00:20:14.854\nSo, let's see what happens.\n\n400\n00:20:14.854 --> 00:20:17.354\nI'm gonna hit Sign In and\nit could still fail, we'll see.\n\n401\n00:20:17.354 --> 00:20:21.484\nBut it's gonna reach out and try and\nautomatically configure me for Exchange,\n\n402\n00:20:21.484 --> 00:20:24.574\ncuz it knows the type of server\nI'm connected to and it did.\n\n403\n00:20:24.574 --> 00:20:27.174\nSo it said, all right,\nwe already know the servers to talk to,\n\n404\n00:20:27.174 --> 00:20:28.314\nyou don't need to tell us.\n\n405\n00:20:28.314 --> 00:20:30.314\nWe already know the port numbers to use.\n\n406\n00:20:30.314 --> 00:20:33.574\nAnd by the way,\nwe're not just gonna do mail and notes.\n\n407\n00:20:33.574 --> 00:20:37.160\nWe can also do Contacts,\nCalendars and Reminders too and\n\n408\n00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:39.934\nit's gonna connect all of those things up.\n\n409\n00:20:39.934 --> 00:20:43.799\nSo when I hit Done,\nI've now got a Microsoft Exchange account\n\n410\n00:20:43.799 --> 00:20:46.634\nthat's being used by\nmore than one program.\n\n411\n00:20:46.634 --> 00:20:50.780\nSo if I fire up Mail,\nI'm gonna launch the Mail app.\n\n412\n00:20:50.780 --> 00:20:53.860\nHere it goes into Mail and there's my\nmailbox, that doesn't look any different.\n\n413\n00:20:54.870 --> 00:20:59.595\nBut if I go down to my Calendar and\nI fire that up,\n\n414\n00:20:59.595 --> 00:21:02.798\nhere's John Doe's calendar.\n\n415\n00:21:02.798 --> 00:21:08.398\nAnd if we take a look at today, let's\nsee what's on John's agenda for today.\n\n416\n00:21:08.398 --> 00:21:11.180\nI can see that it's St.\nPatrick's Day in the US and\n\n417\n00:21:11.180 --> 00:21:14.758\nthat there's a software demo\nscheduled in Studio Two at 11 AM.\n\n418\n00:21:14.758 --> 00:21:19.711\nThat's his calendar that's stored up in\nOffice 365 is being loaded right here and\n\n419\n00:21:19.711 --> 00:21:21.858\nyou can see that I'm the organizer.\n\n420\n00:21:21.858 --> 00:21:25.231\nJohn Doe is a member, so\nhe's been invited to it and\n\n421\n00:21:25.231 --> 00:21:28.138\nhe can start to create\nnew calendar events.\n\n422\n00:21:28.138 --> 00:21:32.721\nAnd so, we'll maybe schedule\nanother software demo and\n\n423\n00:21:32.721 --> 00:21:35.498\nwe'll schedule it for right now.\n\n424\n00:21:35.498 --> 00:21:38.953\nSo here's another software\ndemo that I'm scheduling and\n\n425\n00:21:38.953 --> 00:21:43.758\nit's being added and put into his\ncalendar that his, well, actually, shoot.\n\n426\n00:21:43.758 --> 00:21:45.058\nWhich calendar did I go into?\n\n427\n00:21:45.058 --> 00:21:46.078\nYou do have more than one calendar.\n\n428\n00:21:46.078 --> 00:21:48.938\nIf I click that Calendar button over here,\nyou see these different calendars.\n\n429\n00:21:48.938 --> 00:21:53.918\nI've got a Home calendar,\na Work calendar and my Exchange calendar.\n\n430\n00:21:53.918 --> 00:21:55.418\nAnd so,\nthe color of these things are important.\n\n431\n00:21:55.418 --> 00:21:57.978\nWhen I created this software demo,\nsee how it's blue?\n\n432\n00:21:57.978 --> 00:22:00.918\nThat's cuz it's in my home calendar,\nthat's stored right here in my Mac.\n\n433\n00:22:00.918 --> 00:22:02.938\nI need it to be stored in Exchange.\n\n434\n00:22:02.938 --> 00:22:04.438\nSo, I stored it in the wrong place.\n\n435\n00:22:04.438 --> 00:22:10.298\nSo if I edit that, we can take it and\nmove it to the Exchange Calendar.\n\n436\n00:22:10.298 --> 00:22:12.738\nAnd now,\nit'll be stored up on Microsoft servers.\n\n437\n00:22:12.738 --> 00:22:14.889\nSo now it's up there in\nthe Microsoft servers and\n\n438\n00:22:14.889 --> 00:22:17.418\nI can synchronize it with other people,\nand off it goes.\n\n439\n00:22:17.418 --> 00:22:20.678\n>> So Don, this is really like a true\nelectronic personal assistant.\n\n440\n00:22:20.678 --> 00:22:22.218\nI mean, you got everything in there.\n\n441\n00:22:22.218 --> 00:22:25.338\nYou got your calendar,\nI also saw contacts in there.\n\n442\n00:22:25.338 --> 00:22:28.841\nThat's a huge one, cuz a lot of people not\nonly they have contacts that come from\n\n443\n00:22:28.841 --> 00:22:31.478\ntheir business, but\nthey have their own that they create.\n\n444\n00:22:31.478 --> 00:22:34.659\nCuz they're not inside their business and\nhaving all of those at the ready is very,\n\n445\n00:22:34.659 --> 00:22:35.438\nvery handy as well.\n\n446\n00:22:35.438 --> 00:22:37.838\n>> Yeah, well, let's say,\nwe hire an new employee.\n\n447\n00:22:37.838 --> 00:22:40.343\nSo we hire somebody at ITProTV,\nwe give them an account they login and\n\n448\n00:22:40.343 --> 00:22:42.038\nthey wanna email other\npeople in the company.\n\n449\n00:22:42.038 --> 00:22:43.298\nWell, they don't know everybody.\n\n450\n00:22:43.298 --> 00:22:46.111\nSo they need a company list,\na list of all of the employees and\n\n451\n00:22:46.111 --> 00:22:47.279\ntheir email addresses.\n\n452\n00:22:47.279 --> 00:22:51.478\nWell, if I fire up contacts, that's now\nconnected to our Exchange environment.\n\n453\n00:22:51.478 --> 00:22:54.157\nAnd so when they look at it,\nwell, I guess right now,\n\n454\n00:22:54.157 --> 00:22:56.198\nI'm just seeing my personal contacts.\n\n455\n00:22:56.198 --> 00:22:59.318\nBut after it syncs a little bit,\nwe have to give it some time to sync.\n\n456\n00:22:59.318 --> 00:23:02.266\nBut after it syncs,\nit'll connect up to ITProTV and\n\n457\n00:23:02.266 --> 00:23:04.278\nit'll show our list of employees.\n\n458\n00:23:04.278 --> 00:23:06.070\nAnd so we'll be able to reach out and\nyou'll see the host, and\n\n459\n00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:06.978\neveryone show up right there.\n\n460\n00:23:06.978 --> 00:23:11.614\nRight now, I'm seeing Don Pezet just\nbecause I had sent him an email already,\n\n461\n00:23:11.614 --> 00:23:14.718\nbut the other ones will\nstart to show up eventually.\n\n462\n00:23:14.718 --> 00:23:18.338\nSometimes you do have to wait, but\nlet me go to contacts and accounts.\n\n463\n00:23:18.338 --> 00:23:21.798\nSo, it is showing up and\ncontacts are showing up.\n\n464\n00:23:21.798 --> 00:23:24.747\nAnytime you sync with a server,\nyou do have to wait a little and\n\n465\n00:23:24.747 --> 00:23:27.318\nyou can turn some of these things off or\non if you want.\n\n466\n00:23:27.318 --> 00:23:30.678\nYou don't have to have them all turned on,\nbut it's kinda neat that we have that.\n\n467\n00:23:30.678 --> 00:23:34.374\nSo, even though Microsoft Exchange\nis kind of from the enemy,\n\n468\n00:23:34.374 --> 00:23:36.618\nfrom the direct competitor to Apple.\n\n469\n00:23:36.618 --> 00:23:38.318\nWe can still integrate nicely with it.\n\n470\n00:23:38.318 --> 00:23:40.850\nSo if that's the collaboration\nsoftware that our company uses,\n\n471\n00:23:40.850 --> 00:23:42.378\nwe can tie to it and we're in business.\n\n472\n00:23:42.378 --> 00:23:46.565\n>> And the cool thing about the contact is\nthat I've found, a lot of people like this\n\n473\n00:23:46.565 --> 00:23:49.718\nis if you create a contact,\nthat is not a corporate contact.\n\n474\n00:23:49.718 --> 00:23:52.478\nThat is your own contact,\nthat's just in your contact list.\n\n475\n00:23:52.478 --> 00:23:57.118\nIf I create a contact in my Mail app,\nDon does not see that.\n\n476\n00:23:57.118 --> 00:23:59.838\nOnly corporate contacts show up for\nboth of us.\n\n477\n00:23:59.838 --> 00:24:00.905\nThat way, we can collaborate.\n\n478\n00:24:00.905 --> 00:24:03.248\nIf we need a corporate contact,\nwe have to contact the admin,\n\n479\n00:24:03.248 --> 00:24:04.203\nwhich happens to be Don.\n\n480\n00:24:04.203 --> 00:24:04.748\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n481\n00:24:04.748 --> 00:24:06.780\n>> And say,\nwe need a new corporate contact.\n\n482\n00:24:06.780 --> 00:24:08.405\nFor maybe this project.\n\n483\n00:24:08.405 --> 00:24:11.411\n>> Yep, and I use Microsoft exchange,\nyou could iCloud and\n\n484\n00:24:11.411 --> 00:24:14.479\nApple will host it all for you or\nyou can use the server app,\n\n485\n00:24:14.479 --> 00:24:18.760\nlet me bring the server out back,\nwe're not at part of that, here it is.\n\n486\n00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:22.690\nSo, if I go to my server app, you'll see\nright over here under services that we've\n\n487\n00:24:22.690 --> 00:24:26.250\ngot a mail server a contact server.\n\n488\n00:24:26.250 --> 00:24:28.166\nWe've got a messaging server,\nthere's a calendar server.\n\n489\n00:24:28.166 --> 00:24:31.400\nThere's a lot of the same pieces that we\nhave in Exchange, but they're right here.\n\n490\n00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:34.190\nAnd what Apple's done, is they've taken\nseveral open source products, and\n\n491\n00:24:34.190 --> 00:24:36.420\nput them together to create\neach of these solutions.\n\n492\n00:24:36.420 --> 00:24:40.100\nSo we can use the server app\nas a collaboration service.\n\n493\n00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:43.400\nIt's far less expensive than\nMicrosoft Exchange, which is not cheap.\n\n494\n00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:47.500\nBut you can get that set up, and\nthen it's in place and off you go,\n\n495\n00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:48.410\nyou're ready to work.\n\n496\n00:24:48.410 --> 00:24:51.510\nSo, integrating with these other\ncollaboration system is not really that\n\n497\n00:24:51.510 --> 00:24:52.355\nbig of a challenge.\n\n498\n00:24:52.355 --> 00:24:56.691\nAll right, the other thing that I wanna\nmention, I guess I kinda already talked\n\n499\n00:24:56.691 --> 00:25:00.185\nabout it a little bit is it's easy\nto focus on mail and context and\n\n500\n00:25:00.185 --> 00:25:02.340\ncalendars cuz those are so important.\n\n501\n00:25:02.340 --> 00:25:08.220\nBut there's other things like I showed\nVimeo, Twitter, Facebook, and those guys.\n\n502\n00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:12.460\nNow, when I start adding those to my\nlaptop, those services become visible and\n\n503\n00:25:12.460 --> 00:25:14.930\nthe various applications\nthat use it right?\n\n504\n00:25:14.930 --> 00:25:19.610\nBut if I have a laptop and a desktop,\nI have to add the account to both.\n\n505\n00:25:19.610 --> 00:25:21.680\nAnd that starts to become\na bit of a challenge, right?\n\n506\n00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:22.740\nIf you have multiple computers.\n\n507\n00:25:22.740 --> 00:25:24.020\nNow if you only have one\ncomputer you don't care.\n\n508\n00:25:24.020 --> 00:25:25.500\nYou set it up on one and you're done.\n\n509\n00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:28.860\nBut if you're like me, well,\nI've got my laptop I use here on the show.\n\n510\n00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:30.760\nI've got my desktop that I use personally.\n\n511\n00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:32.510\nAnd they're different systems.\n\n512\n00:25:32.510 --> 00:25:34.570\nAnd I hate setting up\nthings more than once.\n\n513\n00:25:34.570 --> 00:25:37.680\nWell, if you use iCloud,\n\n514\n00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:42.520\nif you add iCloud to your internet\naccounts, once that's done every other\n\n515\n00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:46.290\naccount you add will get synchronized\nthrough iCloud to your other systems.\n\n516\n00:25:46.290 --> 00:25:50.430\nSo if I add an exchange server here on\nmy laptop it'll show up on my desktop.\n\n517\n00:25:50.430 --> 00:25:53.870\nAnd in fact now that I think about it this\nJohn Doe account is probably showing up on\n\n518\n00:25:53.870 --> 00:25:56.340\nmy laptop now so or my desktop.\n\n519\n00:25:56.340 --> 00:25:59.880\nSo, that's kind of a nice thing\nyou can use more than one.\n\n520\n00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:01.080\nYou're not tied to a single one.\n\n521\n00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:04.100\nSo I do have if I go into\nmy system preferences and\n\n522\n00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:06.470\ninternet accounts I do\nhave an exchange server.\n\n523\n00:26:07.490 --> 00:26:11.110\nBut that's not stopping m from\nhitting the old plus sign and\n\n524\n00:26:11.110 --> 00:26:12.450\nadding something else in.\n\n525\n00:26:12.450 --> 00:26:14.760\nSo I could come in and add iCloud.\n\n526\n00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:18.592\nAnd I could punch in a iCloud account and\nit's gonna connect it up and\n\n527\n00:26:18.592 --> 00:26:22.173\nI'll have mail, and note, and\ncalendar and stuff there too.\n\n528\n00:26:22.173 --> 00:26:25.706\nAnd I'll synchronize\nthe exchange amount of systems.\n\n529\n00:26:25.706 --> 00:26:28.710\nNow if I have more than one male account,\nwhat does that mean?\n\n530\n00:26:28.710 --> 00:26:29.453\nWhat does that do for me?\n\n531\n00:26:29.453 --> 00:26:30.970\nWell, let me show you.\n\n532\n00:26:30.970 --> 00:26:33.640\nThe software will actually\njust keep it separate.\n\n533\n00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:37.240\nIn the calendar,\nI've kind of already showed that, right?\n\n534\n00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:41.440\nIf I jump back into my calendar,\nyou've got your different calendars here.\n\n535\n00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:43.490\nYou would see here your\nexchange calendars and\n\n536\n00:26:43.490 --> 00:26:45.880\nthen your iCloud calendars afterward and\nso on.\n\n537\n00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:50.830\nSo you would see that information,\nor in mail, if you look,\n\n538\n00:26:50.830 --> 00:26:54.260\nit says Mailboxes, Inbox, Sent.\n\n539\n00:26:54.260 --> 00:26:56.690\nI'm in the Inbox for my Mailboxes.\n\n540\n00:26:56.690 --> 00:26:59.190\nAnd if I click on Mailbox, here,\nit will go show each of one that I've got.\n\n541\n00:26:59.190 --> 00:27:00.586\nI've only got one mailbox.\n\n542\n00:27:00.586 --> 00:27:05.520\nLet say I wanna add a I wanna\nadd an iCloud one, right?\n\n543\n00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:07.910\nSo, I'm gonna come in and\nadd my iCloud account, and\n\n544\n00:27:07.910 --> 00:27:08.880\nit'll just show up as a second one.\n\n545\n00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:12.410\nSo I'm just gonna jump up here to\ngood old system preferences, and\n\n546\n00:27:12.410 --> 00:27:13.910\nI'm gonna go to my accounts.\n\n547\n00:27:13.910 --> 00:27:15.155\nAnd this time I'm gonna add in iCloud.\n\n548\n00:27:15.155 --> 00:27:17.670\nYou can actually add in\niCloud in another place.\n\n549\n00:27:17.670 --> 00:27:21.520\nSee, you actually have a dedicated iCloud\nicon right here, so you can jump in and\n\n550\n00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:22.740\nstart to set it up this way.\n\n551\n00:27:24.670 --> 00:27:26.330\nIt kinda depends on how\nyou want to do this.\n\n552\n00:27:26.330 --> 00:27:30.280\nIf you add it here,\nthis is the main one for your computer.\n\n553\n00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:31.823\nSo you'll be able to log in\nwith the account and so on.\n\n554\n00:27:31.823 --> 00:27:34.360\nIf you just wanna add mail and\ncalendar and that stuff,\n\n555\n00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:37.520\nit's better to do it through internet\naccounts and add it this way.\n\n556\n00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:40.310\nThat way it doesn't take\nover your whole computer.\n\n557\n00:27:40.310 --> 00:27:44.600\nSo I'm gonna add an iCloud account and\nI'll add in good ol don at and\n\n558\n00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:48.291\nonce we get that put in place\nassuming I know my password.\n\n559\n00:27:48.291 --> 00:27:49.291\nIt's gonna sign in.\n\n560\n00:27:49.291 --> 00:27:52.992\nAnd I've got multi factor\nauthentication turned on so\n\n561\n00:27:52.992 --> 00:27:56.040\nit might make me verify my account.\n\n562\n00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:58.688\nAll right, I'll agree to\nthe licensing agreement and continue.\n\n563\n00:27:58.688 --> 00:28:02.340\nAnd there we go.\n\n564\n00:28:02.340 --> 00:28:04.700\n[COUGH] Now, it's added in,\n[COUGH] excuse me and\n\n565\n00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:07.160\nnotice how iCloud shows it's inactive.\n\n566\n00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:10.820\nI said you can turn on and\noff features if you want.\n\n567\n00:28:10.820 --> 00:28:13.280\nWhen it says inactive, that means\nnone of the features are turned on.\n\n568\n00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:16.720\nAnd now that I've got it added over here,\nI can see all the features.\n\n569\n00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:18.620\nI wanna turn on Mail.\n\n570\n00:28:18.620 --> 00:28:20.848\nContacts and Calendars, all right?\n\n571\n00:28:20.848 --> 00:28:25.240\nAnd so, I'm going to click on those,\nwith veracity.\n\n572\n00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:26.852\nThere we go.\nIt's still setting up.\n\n573\n00:28:26.852 --> 00:28:29.540\nI guess I'm being impatient, so\nlet me just hit Allow again.\n\n574\n00:28:29.540 --> 00:28:30.670\nThere we go.\nAll right, so\n\n575\n00:28:30.670 --> 00:28:33.980\nit's starting to turn this stuff on,\nand I can see I've got an iCloud Drive,\n\n576\n00:28:33.980 --> 00:28:35.190\nPhotos is starting to sync.\n\n577\n00:28:35.190 --> 00:28:37.110\nI'm gonna turn on Mail, right?\n\n578\n00:28:37.110 --> 00:28:40.200\nSo I'm turning on these\ndifferent settings, and.\n\n579\n00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:45.060\nDo I not have a,\nI guess I don't have iCloud address.\n\n580\n00:28:45.060 --> 00:28:46.138\nI wonder if Don's available.\n\n581\n00:28:46.138 --> 00:28:47.018\nProbably not.\n\n582\n00:28:47.018 --> 00:28:48.701\nLet's see if we can get that one.\n\n583\n00:28:48.701 --> 00:28:49.398\n>> I will be amazed.\n\n584\n00:28:49.398 --> 00:28:51.917\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] No one at Apple is named Don.\n\n585\n00:28:54.830 --> 00:28:55.660\nIt's already taken.\n\n586\n00:28:55.660 --> 00:28:58.118\nSo let's just call it donitpro.\n\n587\n00:28:58.118 --> 00:29:02.120\nAll right, [LAUGH] watch that be taken.\n\n588\n00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:03.540\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and attach that so\n\n589\n00:29:03.540 --> 00:29:06.900\nI'll have that email address and\nit is already taken.\n\n590\n00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:08.360\nNope there we go, being impatient again.\n\n591\n00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:12.140\nAll right, so now I'm got Mail,\nContacts, Calendars, Reminders,\n\n592\n00:29:12.140 --> 00:29:15.420\nPhotos, I might not want these other\nthings, like, I don't wanna sync photos,\n\n593\n00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:20.540\nlet me turn that off and yeah, go away.\n\n594\n00:29:20.540 --> 00:29:22.533\nStop, stop it you're driving me crazy.\n\n595\n00:29:22.533 --> 00:29:23.835\nAll right, well, we'll leave it be then.\n\n596\n00:29:23.835 --> 00:29:25.761\nSo [LAUGH] it really\nwants to leave photos on.\n\n597\n00:29:25.761 --> 00:29:28.479\nSo turning this stuff on and\noff or whatever.\n\n598\n00:29:28.479 --> 00:29:33.860\nAnd now it's all set up and I've got more\nthen one of these collaboration accounts.\n\n599\n00:29:33.860 --> 00:29:37.370\nSo if I jump back into my mail client.\n\n600\n00:29:37.370 --> 00:29:38.380\nLet's me just quite out it,\n\n601\n00:29:38.380 --> 00:29:43.130\nthe mail client It's not so friendly when\nyou add stuff in while it's running.\n\n602\n00:29:43.130 --> 00:29:46.000\nCalendar on the other hand,\nif you look at it, it's all ready updated.\n\n603\n00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.460\nSo I've got my exchange calendar, and\n\n604\n00:29:48.460 --> 00:29:51.250\nmy iCloud calendar all ready\nshowing up side by side here.\n\n605\n00:29:51.250 --> 00:29:52.438\nAnd I can turn them on and\n\n606\n00:29:52.438 --> 00:29:56.248\noff to make the display a little more\nfriendly if I want this all right there.\n\n607\n00:29:56.248 --> 00:30:02.330\nBut if I jump back into mail,\nwhat I'm gonna see is I'm in my inbox.\n\n608\n00:30:02.330 --> 00:30:05.680\nAnd this is what's called\nthe combined inbox.\n\n609\n00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:07.550\nSo this is my inbox for both accounts.\n\n610\n00:30:07.550 --> 00:30:09.470\nI can see here's an exchange email.\n\n611\n00:30:09.470 --> 00:30:10.820\nAnd here's an iCloud email.\n\n612\n00:30:10.820 --> 00:30:11.799\nSo I've got both of these showing up.\n\n613\n00:30:11.799 --> 00:30:15.281\nAnd if I click on mailboxes over here,\nit expands out.\n\n614\n00:30:15.281 --> 00:30:17.690\nAnd see how you've got your inbox.\n\n615\n00:30:17.690 --> 00:30:20.610\nAnd then you can break it down\ninto exchange and iCloud,\n\n616\n00:30:20.610 --> 00:30:24.030\nso I can see just my exchange mail and\njust my iCloud mail.\n\n617\n00:30:24.030 --> 00:30:26.730\nSo you can have more than one\nof these services set up.\n\n618\n00:30:26.730 --> 00:30:29.540\nI know I've got personal email and\nwork email and\n\n619\n00:30:29.540 --> 00:30:33.070\nI usually keep those separate but\nI combine the inbox so I see one view so\n\n620\n00:30:33.070 --> 00:30:34.770\nI just go one place to check for\nmy new email.\n\n621\n00:30:34.770 --> 00:30:35.720\n>> Let's be honest,\n\n622\n00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:39.300\nas IT people we probably have like\nfive different email addresses.\n\n623\n00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:40.890\n>> Yeah.\n>> And without something like this,\n\n624\n00:30:40.890 --> 00:30:41.610\nI would be lost,\n\n625\n00:30:41.610 --> 00:30:44.970\nhaving to log into each one of those\ndifferent accounts, that would be insane.\n\n626\n00:30:44.970 --> 00:30:48.090\nIt's nice that they built in that\nfunctionality, where I can combine them\n\n627\n00:30:48.090 --> 00:30:51.770\nall into one spot, look at all my email,\nmy contacts, and things of that nature.\n\n628\n00:30:51.770 --> 00:30:52.470\n>> Yep.\n\n629\n00:30:52.470 --> 00:30:55.730\nNow, the male client inside of OS 10,\nit's all right.\n\n630\n00:30:55.730 --> 00:30:57.290\nThere's better male clients\nthat are out there.\n\n631\n00:30:57.290 --> 00:30:59.690\nSo don't feel like you have to use these.\n\n632\n00:30:59.690 --> 00:31:03.600\nThere's other ones like post box,\nI know there's on that I like.\n\n633\n00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:05.940\nAnd there's a few other ones that\nare out there that you can use.\n\n634\n00:31:05.940 --> 00:31:07.500\nSo you don't have to use these, but\n\n635\n00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:09.510\nthese are nice because they\nintegrate with the operating system.\n\n636\n00:31:09.510 --> 00:31:11.920\nAnd so now, if I'm in a web browser and\n\n637\n00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:14.490\nI hit email this link,\nit'll launch this email client.\n\n638\n00:31:14.490 --> 00:31:17.010\nIt won't necessarily launch a third\nparty client in some scenarios, so\n\n639\n00:31:17.010 --> 00:31:20.150\nyou got to kinda pick and choose what\nyou want as far as functionality.\n\n640\n00:31:20.150 --> 00:31:23.200\nBut as far as integrating\nwith collaboration services,\n\n641\n00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:25.130\nApple's pretty much got you set up.\n\n642\n00:31:25.130 --> 00:31:28.540\nEmail's the critical one, and\nyou need to remember iMap, Pop3, and\n\n643\n00:31:28.540 --> 00:31:31.670\nSMTP, those three protocols,\nthey're important.\n\n644\n00:31:31.670 --> 00:31:35.370\nAfter that, all the other services\nare kinda extras that are a nice bonus.\n\n645\n00:31:35.370 --> 00:31:38.340\nContacts and calendars are the two\nthat will show up on the exam.\n\n646\n00:31:38.340 --> 00:31:41.350\nAnd be aware that iCloud and\nExchange will give you those.\n\n647\n00:31:41.350 --> 00:31:42.920\nThe other services just do email.\n\n648\n00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:45.250\nSo that's a bit of a challenge\nthat you might bump into.\n\n649\n00:31:45.250 --> 00:31:47.630\n>> Well, that's awesome stuff any way,\nshape or form.\n\n650\n00:31:47.630 --> 00:31:49.280\nThe good news is, like Don said, yeah,\n\n651\n00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:52.630\nthere are third party options you can go\nwith that might be a little bit better.\n\n652\n00:31:52.630 --> 00:31:53.800\nThey might be a lot better.\n\n653\n00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:55.230\nThat could be the case.\n\n654\n00:31:55.230 --> 00:31:57.900\nBut, if you're adjusting something\nthat's gonna get you working.\n\n655\n00:31:57.900 --> 00:32:01.850\nThey already have that built into\nthe operating system itself.\n\n656\n00:32:01.850 --> 00:32:04.450\nSo, go ahead and\nuse it if that's all you need it for.\n\n657\n00:32:04.450 --> 00:32:06.360\nThe basic functionality\nis there waiting for you.\n\n658\n00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:07.680\nJust turn it on and use it.\n\n659\n00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:10.500\nAnd of course,\nif you're trying to pass this exam,\n\n660\n00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:13.680\nit's probably a good idea if\nyou're familiar with that as well.\n\n661\n00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:16.190\nDon, thanks for stopping by and\nexplaining these concepts.\n\n662\n00:32:16.190 --> 00:32:19.940\nShowing us how to use these cool little\nfeatures of our operating system.\n\n663\n00:32:19.940 --> 00:32:22.990\nAnd thank you guys for watching, and we've\ncome to the end of another great episode.\n\n664\n00:32:22.990 --> 00:32:25.310\nHopefully you guys have enjoyed it,\nsigning off for ITProTV,\n\n665\n00:32:25.310 --> 00:32:26.677\nI've been

TV.\n\n3\n00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:18.430\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, and\n\n4\n00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:23.050\nin today's episode, well we're continuing\non with our Mac integration basic series.\n\n5\n00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:26.190\nJoining us, back in the studio again\ntoday, our guiding star in that endeavor.\n\n6\n00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:27.680\nIt is none other then our good friend Mr.\nDon Pezet.\n\n7\n00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:28.730\nDon, welcome back sir.\n\n8\n00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.890\n>> Thanks for\nhaving me back on the show, Daniel,\n\n9\n00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.850\nand ready to jump right back in\nthe world of Mac integration basics.\n\n10\n00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:36.715\nIn this episode, we're going to\nchange gears just a little bit.\n\n11\n00:00:36.715 --> 00:00:39.875\nIn the other episodes we've always been\ntalking about how to get our Mac to\n\n12\n00:00:39.875 --> 00:00:43.975\nintegrate with other systems on\nthe network, usually Windows machines.\n\n13\n00:00:43.975 --> 00:00:46.225\nIn this one we're gonna step\nback from that a second, and\n\n14\n00:00:46.225 --> 00:00:49.425\nwe're gonna look at some of\nthe security features in Mac OS.\n\n15\n00:00:49.425 --> 00:00:50.945\nNow I know what you're thinking, like hey,\n\n16\n00:00:50.945 --> 00:00:53.455\nthis is just security,\nit's not integrating at all, is it?\n\n17\n00:00:53.455 --> 00:00:56.465\nWell, security features\nare a double-edged sword.\n\n18\n00:00:56.465 --> 00:01:00.440\nOn one hand,\nthey secure your system and protect it.\n\n19\n00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:01.870\nOn the other hand,\n\n20\n00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.610\nthey make it hard to integrate with other\nsystems cuz we block so much stuff.\n\n21\n00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.670\nNow that doesn't mean you want\nto turn all these things off.\n\n22\n00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.651\nYou need to be familiar with each and\n\n23\n00:01:10.651 --> 00:01:13.369\nevery security feature\nthat's a part of Mac OS.\n\n24\n00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:17.588\nAnd what it does and\nhow to safely use it on the network.\n\n25\n00:01:17.588 --> 00:01:20.350\nWhen it's okay to say, you know what,\nI'm going to turn that feature off.\n\n26\n00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.820\nAnd when it's not okay, when you\nneed to have that feature turned on.\n\n27\n00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.400\nSo while its not directly integrating,\neverything we're about to talk about in\n\n28\n00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.570\nthis episode is something that can block\nus integrating with other systems.\n\n29\n00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.000\nSo that's why we need to be aware of it.\n\n30\n00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.800\nAnd this episode is, it's kind of\nlike a potluck of security features,\n\n31\n00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.830\na virtual cornucopia of features\nthat we can turn on and off.\n\n32\n00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:42.920\nAnd most of them are all\nready turned on for us.\n\n33\n00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.730\nWe just need to be aware of their names\nand their functionality for the exam.\n\n34\n00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:47.920\nSo it's gonna be a strange episode.\n\n35\n00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.110\nIt's more than likely way more than\nwe'd get through in one episode.\n\n36\n00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.100\nSo we'll probably break this up\nover two or three episodes so\n\n37\n00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.170\nwe can get through each one.\n\n38\n00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.660\nBut you'll be surprised all the really\ncool security technologies that are under\n\n39\n00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:00.600\nthe hood in Mac OS that most\npeople don't even know about.\n\n40\n00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.080\nDon't even realize.\n\n41\n00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.210\nSometimes that's a good thing, it's\nsecurity that doesn't get in your way.\n\n42\n00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.050\nOther times it's a bad thing because it's\nsecurity features that aren't turned on\n\n43\n00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.650\nby default.\n\n44\n00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:11.250\nAnd unless you know about them,\nyou don't know to turn them on and\n\n45\n00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.740\nthat means you're not\nbenefiting from them.\n\n46\n00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.809\nSo these are definitely things\nthat we need to be aware of.\n\n47\n00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.200\nSo let's kick this turkey off.\n\n48\n00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.910\nThe first one we're gonna start with is\none of those invisible security features.\n\n49\n00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.726\nIt's one that's turned on\nby default on Mac OS, and\n\n50\n00:02:24.726 --> 00:02:27.160\nit's called System Integrity Protection.\n\n51\n00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:33.190\nSystem Integrity Protection,\nit should be easier to say,\n\n52\n00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:40.030\nis a special feature of Mac OS where every\nprogram that gets run, gets sandboxed.\n\n53\n00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.000\nNow, I threw up my little aircodes,\n\n54\n00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.440\nI stressed the word Sandbox\nbecause if you take the exam and\n\n55\n00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.760\nyou don't see the word Sandbox once,\nthen it's like winning the lottery.\n\n56\n00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.790\nIt is gonna turn up on the exam somewhere.\n\n57\n00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:55.280\nSandboxing is where you isolate\napplications from other applications.\n\n58\n00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.530\nWhen a hacker breaks into your system or\nsome kind of network vulnerability\n\n59\n00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.430\ngets exploited, it's typically\na vulnerability found in one program.\n\n60\n00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.530\nBut, once they break through that program,\n\n61\n00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.490\nthey can then leapfrog throughout\nthe whole rest of your system.\n\n62\n00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:10.460\nWhen we sand box an application,\nthe application runs,\n\n63\n00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:13.340\nthe vulnerability might be there,\nthe hacker breaks into that application.\n\n64\n00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.800\nAnd then they're stuck\nin that little world,\n\n65\n00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.440\nthe little world of that application.\n\n66\n00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.330\nAnd they're not able to access\nthe rest of your resources.\n\n67\n00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:22.680\nIt's really a pretty\ncomplex thing to set up.\n\n68\n00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.060\nIf you work in the Unix world or the Linux\nworld, you have chroot that lets you\n\n69\n00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.530\nchange the root of various applications\nto create these little jails for them.\n\n70\n00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:31.945\nAnd it's kinda hard to do.\n\n71\n00:03:31.945 --> 00:03:33.940\nWell, in Mac OS it's done for\nyou automatically.\n\n72\n00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:34.760\nIt's already done,\n\n73\n00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.750\nas you launch these applications,\nthey run in their own little space.\n\n74\n00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.760\nAnd for most of us,\nwe never even notice it.\n\n75\n00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.150\nIt just happens in the background,\nand that's it.\n\n76\n00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.680\nBut there are times where we do see it.\n\n77\n00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.180\nYou see it anytime you go\nto install an application.\n\n78\n00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.020\nBecause when you install an application,\nwhat's it have to do?\n\n79\n00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:55.340\nIt has to write to some\nsensitive areas on the computer.\n\n80\n00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:58.260\nAnd those sensitive areas are protected.\n\n81\n00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:59.889\nLet me show you what I mean.\n\n82\n00:03:59.889 --> 00:04:01.839\nIf I browse into my finder, and\n\n83\n00:04:01.839 --> 00:04:05.770\nI go to my Macintosh hard drive,\nI only see four folders.\n\n84\n00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:07.420\nMy hard drive looks pretty empty.\n\n85\n00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:09.879\nThese four folders are important though.\n\n86\n00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:12.390\nApplications, that's where my programs go.\n\n87\n00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.500\nIf I put an application in\nthe Application folder,\n\n88\n00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.560\nthat's where I store it so it can run.\n\n89\n00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.500\nBut if one application gets compromised,\n\n90\n00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.820\nin theory it could start\nmodifying other applications.\n\n91\n00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:26.890\nAnd so I might've gotten\na malware installed via email,\n\n92\n00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:29.450\nand then it goes and\nit modifies my web browser.\n\n93\n00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:33.130\nAnd now every time I browse to a website,\nit's displaying pop-up ads and\n\n94\n00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:33.860\nthings like that.\n\n95\n00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:35.620\nOne application has modified another.\n\n96\n00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:38.510\nI don't want programs to be\nable to write to applications.\n\n97\n00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:39.090\nVery sensitive.\n\n98\n00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.530\nLibrary that's where all of\nmy system preferences are.\n\n99\n00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:45.630\nAll the configuration for my system.\n\n100\n00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:47.930\nAll the security features\nwe're about to talk about,\n\n101\n00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:50.020\nthey're configured inside\nof that library folder.\n\n102\n00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:52.890\nAnd so if I get infected with malware and\n\n103\n00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:57.570\nit modifies other systems,\nit could turn off security features.\n\n104\n00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:59.370\nSo it's another one that\nI want to be protecting.\n\n105\n00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:01.900\nBut I can't lock it completely down.\n\n106\n00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:03.970\nBecause every program has\ntheir own preferences, right?\n\n107\n00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:06.250\nIf I go on to the Library folder, and\n\n108\n00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:09.520\nI find the Preferences folder\nwhich is buried in here somewhere.\n\n109\n00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:10.940\nThere.\n\n110\n00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:13.700\nEvery application has its\nown set of preferences.\n\n111\n00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:17.060\nSo, if I browse around,\nthat's an interesting effect there.\n\n112\n00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:18.860\nSo, if I browse around in here and\nstart to look,\n\n113\n00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:21.150\nmost of the stuff is Apple stuff, right?\n\n114\n00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:22.560\nBut if I keep looking.\n\n115\n00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.310\nI guess I really don't have any third\nparty software installed on here.\n\n116\n00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:28.140\nBut, my third party software would all\nhave their own preference files too.\n\n117\n00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:31.290\nAnd those programs need to be able\nto write to their own preferences.\n\n118\n00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:34.550\nBut they shouldn't be allowed to\nwrite to other programs' preferences.\n\n119\n00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:37.870\nThat needs to be isolated and\nprotected access.\n\n120\n00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:42.180\nThat's exactly what\nthe System Integrity Protection is doing.\n\n121\n00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:46.030\nIt's restricting the access that\npeople have to these various folders.\n\n122\n00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:48.090\nAnd there's a lot more than these.\n\n123\n00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:50.580\nI just see these four folders\nwhen I look at my hard drive, but\n\n124\n00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:53.490\nif I drop into the terminal,\nlet's have some fun here.\n\n125\n00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:56.470\nSo I'm gonna drop into the terminal,\nI'm gonna change into my root.\n\n126\n00:05:56.470 --> 00:06:00.340\nAnd I'm gonna go do a quick ls- la so\nI'm gonna see everything.\n\n127\n00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:06.790\nYou'll see that there's a lot more folders\nin my root than what I saw in the finder.\n\n128\n00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:11.330\nThe finder showed me Applications,\nLibrary, Users,\n\n129\n00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:15.910\nand what was the other one, Application,\nLibrary, System, and Users.\n\n130\n00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:18.360\nDid I mention System?\n\n131\n00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:19.790\nSystem's kind of important.\n\n132\n00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:21.090\nThat's where Mac OS is.\n\n133\n00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:22.770\nThat's where the operating system is.\n\n134\n00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:27.150\nSo if malware gets installed, it would\nlove to modify the operating system.\n\n135\n00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:29.500\nIt can have it do all\nsorts of crazy things.\n\n136\n00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:31.360\nAnd that would be really, really bad news.\n\n137\n00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:33.420\nWe definitely don't want that.\n\n138\n00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:35.080\nIf you're ever bored,\n\n139\n00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:39.450\ngo check out the ITPro TV blog cuz we\ndid a special on the KeyRanger malware.\n\n140\n00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:42.400\nAnd I showed in there how once\nyour machine was infected,\n\n141\n00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:44.980\nit started dropping files\nin different places.\n\n142\n00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:47.040\nMost of which were in\nthe Library folder and so\n\n143\n00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:50.980\nit was dropping files into places where\nit shouldn't have normally had access to.\n\n144\n00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:54.360\nBut it got that access because\nwe ran the program and\n\n145\n00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:56.180\nbypassed System Integrity Protection.\n\n146\n00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:59.630\nSo that's a kind of\nan interesting way of seeing that.\n\n147\n00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:05.730\nBut all these other folders are pretty\nimportant too, like /bin, and /sbin.\n\n148\n00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:09.380\nThose are where the binaries for\nthe underlying BSD system reside.\n\n149\n00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:10.860\nThose are really low level.\n\n150\n00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:12.210\nEnd users don't normally see those.\n\n151\n00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:15.050\nAnd if malware can modify them,\nthat's a big problem.\n\n152\n00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:18.970\nSo a lot of these folders are protected\nby System Integrity Protection.\n\n153\n00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:21.970\nWhen you run a program,\nthey're not allowed to touch these.\n\n154\n00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:23.490\nIf they try it gets blocked.\n\n155\n00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:25.660\nAnd that stops malware from working.\n\n156\n00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:27.200\nThey can't modify these folders.\n\n157\n00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:29.700\nBut there's some folders we\ndo want them to write to.\n\n158\n00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:31.480\nWe want them to be able to\nwrite to their own preferences.\n\n159\n00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:33.960\nWe want them to be able to write to\ntheir own little library folder.\n\n160\n00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:35.510\nWhere they have their application support.\n\n161\n00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:37.610\nSo those are allowed.\n\n162\n00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:40.870\nSystem Integrity Protection is\na service that's configured by Apple.\n\n163\n00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:43.980\nThat says here's what you're\ngoing to have access to.\n\n164\n00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:45.890\nAnd for the most part, it's invisible.\n\n165\n00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:47.280\nMost people don't even know\nabout these folders, so\n\n166\n00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:48.540\nthey don't care if they're protected or\nnot.\n\n167\n00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:52.070\nIf they don't even know the folder exists,\nwhat do they care, right?\n\n168\n00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:55.855\nBut where we see it as an end user is\nreally through part of what's called\n\n169\n00:07:55.855 --> 00:07:56.811\nthe Gatekeeper.\n\n170\n00:07:56.811 --> 00:08:00.975\nWhen you go to install a program, so\nlet's say I go into my computer, and\n\n171\n00:08:00.975 --> 00:08:02.838\nI wanna install Google Chrome.\n\n172\n00:08:02.838 --> 00:08:03.523\nRight.\n\n173\n00:08:03.523 --> 00:08:07.258\nIf I want to install Google Chrome I\ncan just take it and\n\n174\n00:08:07.258 --> 00:08:09.090\nI can mount that DMG file.\n\n175\n00:08:09.090 --> 00:08:12.290\nSo, I'm going to mount that DMG file and\n\n176\n00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:16.540\nthen I just need to drag Google Chrome and\ndrop it in the applications folder.\n\n177\n00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:20.090\nNow, am I allowed to write\nto the applications folder?\n\n178\n00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:20.840\nI am.\n\n179\n00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:22.090\nIf I'm an administrator I am.\n\n180\n00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:24.200\nIf I'm an end user, I'm not.\n\n181\n00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:28.430\nIf I'm a regular user you're not allowed\nto write to the applications folder.\n\n182\n00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:32.370\nSo when you go to install Chrome and\nit asks you to drag Chrome and\n\n183\n00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:37.135\ndrop it into applications, if you're\nan administrator that'll get written to be\n\n184\n00:08:37.135 --> 00:08:40.270\n/applicationsfolder and\nI'm an administrator,\n\n185\n00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:42.280\nsee how it didn't prompt me for\na password or anything like that.\n\n186\n00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:43.880\nI have those permissions.\n\n187\n00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:47.260\nFor an end user though,\nsystem integrity protection kicks in and\n\n188\n00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.480\nsays you're not allowed\nto write to that folder.\n\n189\n00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:52.700\nSo instead,\nwe're going to virtualize that folder and\n\n190\n00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:55.380\nwe're going to put it in your\nown applications folder.\n\n191\n00:08:55.380 --> 00:09:00.860\nGoing back to the file system, Macs\nare supposed to be magical and easy and\n\n192\n00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:06.990\nall GUI, so I hate to do too much in the\nterminal but when I look at my root drive.\n\n193\n00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:08.510\nYou've got the applications folder.\n\n194\n00:09:08.510 --> 00:09:10.710\nRight?\nSo that's /applications.\n\n195\n00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:11.800\nThat's that folder.\n\n196\n00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:13.830\nSo if I change into that directory.\n\n197\n00:09:13.830 --> 00:09:15.860\nAnd I do like a PWD.\n\n198\n00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:16.620\nPrint Working Directory.\n\n199\n00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:18.100\nThere I'm in /applications.\n\n200\n00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:18.980\nRight?\n\n201\n00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:22.250\nBut if I change into my home directory.\n\n202\n00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:27.410\nSo if I go into /Users/dpezet and\nI take a look in there.\n\n203\n00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:32.330\nWell, just kinda looking at it,\nI have Documents, Downloads,\n\n204\n00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:34.840\nLibrary, Movies, Music and so on.\n\n205\n00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:38.170\nBut if I'm a regular user and\nI try to install an application,\n\n206\n00:09:38.170 --> 00:09:40.400\nI'll actually get an applications\nfolder in here and\n\n207\n00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:43.230\nI can have applications that\nare just tied to my user account.\n\n208\n00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:46.830\nThey're isolated, they're sandboxed to me\nbecause I brought them in and it's system\n\n209\n00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:49.710\nintegrity protection that's doing that I\ndon't have permission to modify it for\n\n210\n00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:53.500\nthe whole system and I can't override\nthat but I can have my own application.\n\n211\n00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:58.090\nSo you may see an applications folder\ndevelop right here for the end user.\n\n212\n00:09:58.090 --> 00:09:59.100\nAnd it pops up.\n\n213\n00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:00.690\nYou can make it yourself if you want.\n\n214\n00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:06.440\nYou can just do a quick\nmkdir Applications right?\n\n215\n00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:10.050\nAnd Apple even to an extent it expects\nyou to do that because if I go to my\n\n216\n00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:10.800\nhome folder.\n\n217\n00:10:12.930 --> 00:10:13.640\nI can see it.\n\n218\n00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:16.510\nAnd see how it applied\nthe applications icon to it.\n\n219\n00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:17.540\nI didn't do that.\n\n220\n00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:19.030\nI just made a folder called applications.\n\n221\n00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:21.180\nBut Apple said look there's your\npersonal applications folder,\n\n222\n00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:23.080\nlet me display that and\ngive it the right icon.\n\n223\n00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:24.530\nThey expect it to be there.\n\n224\n00:10:24.530 --> 00:10:26.820\nSo you may see that in your\nindividual user account.\n\n225\n00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:28.880\nThat's part,\nof system integrity protection.\n\n226\n00:10:30.610 --> 00:10:31.330\nI mentioned gatekeeper.\n\n227\n00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:33.450\nWe're gonna talk more\nabout gatekeeper later.\n\n228\n00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:36.835\nWhen you download a program from the\nInternet like I just did, and you copied\n\n229\n00:10:36.835 --> 00:10:40.310\ninto applications, even if you're allowed\nto do it like I was an administrator,\n\n230\n00:10:40.310 --> 00:10:44.922\nthe first time that I run it it's gonna\nrecognize that it's an internet program.\n\n231\n00:10:44.922 --> 00:10:46.830\nThat it's not one that was\nbuilt into the system.\n\n232\n00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:50.120\nAnd so I'm going to get a warning\nabout that, and there it is.\n\n233\n00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:52.710\nSee how it says it's an application\ndownloaded from the internet are you sure\n\n234\n00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:54.980\nyou want to open it right.\n\n235\n00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:58.560\nAnd that's part of really\ngatekeeper we'll talk about later.\n\n236\n00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:00.750\nBut it's also a part of\nsystem integrity protection.\n\n237\n00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:04.480\nSaying hey you're about to run this\nprogram, are you sure you want to do that?\n\n238\n00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:08.550\nCuz this program when it runs might\nbe able to modify other things.\n\n239\n00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:10.700\nNow, Chrome really doesn't\nmodify anything else, it's fine.\n\n240\n00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:13.860\nBut let's take something a little\nmore aggressive, like VirtualBox.\n\n241\n00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:16.860\nNow with Chrome,\nI just had an application, I drag and\n\n242\n00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:18.228\ndropped my application folder,\nthat was it.\n\n243\n00:11:18.228 --> 00:11:21.420\nBut with VirtualBox.\n\n244\n00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:24.380\nIt actually has software\ndrivers that it has to install.\n\n245\n00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:25.190\nDrivers.\n\n246\n00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:26.950\nThese are things that have\nto go in the library folder.\n\n247\n00:11:26.950 --> 00:11:29.510\nThese are things that have\nto modify the system.\n\n248\n00:11:29.510 --> 00:11:32.690\nSo when the system boots up I'm gonna have\nkernel extensions that are part of this.\n\n249\n00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:33.920\nNow I'm talking about the kernel.\n\n250\n00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:34.880\nOnto the hood.\n\n251\n00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:38.190\nThe core of the operating\nsystem in Mac OS.\n\n252\n00:11:38.190 --> 00:11:39.480\nWe're gonna modify that.\n\n253\n00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:41.120\nThat's pretty significant, right?\n\n254\n00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:44.034\nIt's gonna load virtual keyboard drivers,\nwhich are perfect for\n\n255\n00:11:44.034 --> 00:11:47.080\nlogging everything that you type and\nsending it to various websites.\n\n256\n00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:50.120\nThis is something that malware will do,\nbut this isn't malware though.\n\n257\n00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:53.870\nThis is software that I trust, this is\nsoftware I want to install and use.\n\n258\n00:11:53.870 --> 00:11:57.510\nBut because it modifies places\noutside of the applications folder,\n\n259\n00:11:57.510 --> 00:12:00.940\ninstalling it is not a matter of dragging\nand dropping like other programs.\n\n260\n00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:02.465\nWhoa, I shouldn't have done that.\n\n261\n00:12:02.465 --> 00:12:03.230\n[LAUGH] Whoops.\n\n262\n00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:04.120\nAll right there we go.\n\n263\n00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:08.830\nSo it's not a matter of dragging and\ndropping it which is what I almost did.\n\n264\n00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:11.190\nIt's got a pkg, a package file.\n\n265\n00:12:11.190 --> 00:12:13.150\nAnd the package file\nis more like a script.\n\n266\n00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:15.845\nIt's gonna go and\nit's gonna modify a lot of stuff.\n\n267\n00:12:15.845 --> 00:12:17.720\nThat we can't normally do.\n\n268\n00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:21.029\nSo when I run that, system integrity\nprotection is gonna kick in and\n\n269\n00:12:21.029 --> 00:12:23.600\nit's gonna go, whoa hold on a minute here.\n\n270\n00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:25.870\nYou're about to do some really bad stuff.\n\n271\n00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:27.540\nAre you sure you want to do that?\n\n272\n00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:29.530\nAre you okay with that?\n\n273\n00:12:29.530 --> 00:12:32.060\nAnd it's gonna try and modify things.\n\n274\n00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:33.970\nThat can't normally be modified.\n\n275\n00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:37.670\nAnd so it says right here we've gotta\ncheck and see if the software can run.\n\n276\n00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:38.940\nWe'll say okay to that.\n\n277\n00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:41.420\nBut as we move forward,\nit's gonna stop me.\n\n278\n00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:44.650\nAnd I'm gonna get a prompt\nfrom the system that says,\n\n279\n00:12:44.650 --> 00:12:46.480\nare you sure you want to do this?\n\n280\n00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:48.420\nYou've got to be\nan administrator to do it.\n\n281\n00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:50.180\nAnd it hasn't done it yet,\nbut it will do it.\n\n282\n00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:51.610\nThere, right here.\n\n283\n00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:53.300\nInstaller is trying to\ninstall new software.\n\n284\n00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:55.030\nType your password to allow this.\n\n285\n00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:59.870\nWhen we type that password,\nwhat we're doing is effectively disabling\n\n286\n00:12:59.870 --> 00:13:04.550\nsystem integrity protection,\nwe're saying just for a minute, allow this\n\n287\n00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:08.450\nprogram to write to folders it wouldn't\nnormally be allowed to write to, okay?\n\n288\n00:13:08.450 --> 00:13:12.080\nAnd so, I'm gonna grant that and this is\nthe dangerous part, I'm the administrator\n\n289\n00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:16.180\non this system so, I can provide that\npassword, I can install that software and\n\n290\n00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:19.470\nnow it's able to modify things\nthat are normally isolated.\n\n291\n00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:24.700\nSo the challenge here is, I'll refer\nback to that key ranger demo that I did\n\n292\n00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:29.290\nin our blog where when you downloaded it\nyou were downloading legitimate software.\n\n293\n00:13:29.290 --> 00:13:31.830\nYou thought you were downloading\na bit torrent client, but\n\n294\n00:13:31.830 --> 00:13:35.050\nwhen you installed it the malware was\ninjected in that bit torrent client.\n\n295\n00:13:35.050 --> 00:13:37.470\nSo, when you ran it, it would say,\ndo you want to allow this?\n\n296\n00:13:37.470 --> 00:13:38.190\nAnd you'd say, Well yeah!\n\n297\n00:13:38.190 --> 00:13:41.210\nThis is software I downloaded,\nI wanna give it my credentials.\n\n298\n00:13:41.210 --> 00:13:43.240\nAnd now it installs malware along with it.\n\n299\n00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:46.440\nAnd that malware is allowed to write to\nareas on the drive that it's not normally\n\n300\n00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:47.820\nallowed to write to.\n\n301\n00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:49.620\nAnd we've bypassed system\nintegrity protection.\n\n302\n00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:50.760\nThat's the risk.\n\n303\n00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:51.520\nOkay?\n\n304\n00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:53.910\nSo, it's really important\nthat we be aware of that.\n\n305\n00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:55.910\nThat we trust the software we download.\n\n306\n00:13:55.910 --> 00:13:58.170\nIf we're going to bypass that and\nlet it install.\n\n307\n00:13:58.170 --> 00:13:59.850\nWe've gotta be aware of that.\n\n308\n00:13:59.850 --> 00:14:02.250\nNow, one area where we don't have to worry\nabout it is if we're getting apps from\n\n309\n00:14:02.250 --> 00:14:03.200\nthe App Store.\n\n310\n00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:05.720\nIf you download an app from\nthe Apple App Store or\n\n311\n00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:09.190\nthe Mac App Store,\nthose are digitally signed by Apple,\n\n312\n00:14:09.190 --> 00:14:11.720\nthey've already approved it and\nso you won't get these prompts.\n\n313\n00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:14.550\nIt will actually allow it\nto be written down and\n\n314\n00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:16.690\nit'll do that without you\nhaving to get involved.\n\n315\n00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:18.460\nSo, for example,\nif I go into my app store,\n\n316\n00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:21.360\nwhoops I'm try to get into my apps store.\n\n317\n00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:23.320\nNot iBooks.\n\n318\n00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:27.180\nSo if I get into the app store here and\nI go to download some\n\n319\n00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:32.455\napp that I've purchased like\nI'll take MediaInfo for example.\n\n320\n00:14:32.455 --> 00:14:34.740\nMediaInfo is a little\nutility I bought forever ago.\n\n321\n00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:37.550\nIt lets you look at video files and\nkinda see what they're made out of.\n\n322\n00:14:37.550 --> 00:14:41.340\nIf I get this from the app store well.\n\n323\n00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:42.230\nWhy is it telling me to buy it?\n\n324\n00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:44.440\nI've already bought the darn thing.\n\n325\n00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:46.550\n>> Because you need it again don't you?\n\n326\n00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:47.690\n[LAUGH]\n>> Well sometimes it does that.\n\n327\n00:14:47.690 --> 00:14:50.210\nLet's see if I can remember\nwhat my password is.\n\n328\n00:14:50.210 --> 00:14:55.680\nSo anyhow it's going to ask me to\nauthenticate and it's going to install it.\n\n329\n00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:59.820\nNow the installer is digitally signed by\nApple because it's up there in the app\n\n330\n00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:02.030\nstore, they've got it,\nand it's digitally signed.\n\n331\n00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:05.990\nSo when it installs, it's not going to\nprompt me for administrative access.\n\n332\n00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:07.570\nIt's already trusted.\n\n333\n00:15:07.570 --> 00:15:10.520\nBut if I try to modify this file or\nchange it or whatever,\n\n334\n00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:13.630\nthat's not allowed,\nbecause it's protected by the app store.\n\n335\n00:15:13.630 --> 00:15:16.050\nAnd I will have to be\nan administrator to do that.\n\n336\n00:15:16.050 --> 00:15:17.450\nWell here we go with\npassword challenges again.\n\n337\n00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:20.780\nLet me try one more time to see if I\ncan't remember what my password is.\n\n338\n00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:22.500\nAnd I think it took it that time.\n\n339\n00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:24.340\nSo well apparently not.\n\n340\n00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:27.590\nSo anyhow I'm gonna try at some point and\nget this app,\n\n341\n00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:29.960\nand when I install it, there we go.\n\n342\n00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:32.630\nLet's set that to required,\nit did take my password.\n\n343\n00:15:32.630 --> 00:15:35.350\nSo it is going to install.\n\n344\n00:15:35.350 --> 00:15:39.110\nNow when it installs from the App Store,\nit's like it's blessed by Apple, right?\n\n345\n00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:41.260\nIt's digitally signed,\nthey know it's not modified,\n\n346\n00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:42.530\nthey've already checked it for malware.\n\n347\n00:15:42.530 --> 00:15:46.720\nIt's software that we can trust and it\ninstalls, see how it's gone to Open, and\n\n348\n00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:49.450\nnow I can fire that open, it's gonna\nlaunch, and here's MediaInfo, so\n\n349\n00:15:49.450 --> 00:15:52.080\nI'm in that software, and\nwe're up and running.\n\n350\n00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:56.590\nIt's trusted because it came\nfrom the App Store, right?\n\n351\n00:15:56.590 --> 00:15:59.936\nNow the neat part here is,\nI didn't see all that happen,\n\n352\n00:15:59.936 --> 00:16:02.884\nsystem integrity protection\nwas all invisible.\n\n353\n00:16:02.884 --> 00:16:06.492\nBut if I browse to the hard drive and\nI go into Applications, and\n\n354\n00:16:06.492 --> 00:16:08.750\nI find MediaInfo in here, there it is.\n\n355\n00:16:08.750 --> 00:16:10.275\nIf I try and get rid of it, right?\n\n356\n00:16:10.275 --> 00:16:13.651\nLike if I try uninstall, I'll just\ndrag that and drop it on my trash,\n\n357\n00:16:13.651 --> 00:16:16.480\nthat I have to be\nan administrator to uninstall it.\n\n358\n00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:19.508\nIf you try and modify this, in any way\nyou've got to be an administrator.\n\n359\n00:16:19.508 --> 00:16:22.680\nIf there's an update, you're gonna let\nthe update apply through the app store.\n\n360\n00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:25.830\nIf you try to do it outside of the app\nstore, you've gotta be an administrator.\n\n361\n00:16:25.830 --> 00:16:27.230\nSo it's protected, right?\n\n362\n00:16:27.230 --> 00:16:32.390\nIt's been sandboxed and isolated so\nthat it can't be tampered with, right?\n\n363\n00:16:32.390 --> 00:16:36.170\nBecause Apple has said this is\ntrustable software, if we modify it,\n\n364\n00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:37.950\nit's not trustable anymore, right?\n\n365\n00:16:37.950 --> 00:16:39.330\nSo that integrity is being protected.\n\n366\n00:16:39.330 --> 00:16:43.970\nSo, that's one of the built-in features\nthat, as far as I know, you can't disable,\n\n367\n00:16:43.970 --> 00:16:45.810\nother than overriding it at runtime.\n\n368\n00:16:45.810 --> 00:16:47.310\nAnd it takes a human to override it,\n\n369\n00:16:47.310 --> 00:16:49.060\nbecause you've gotta\ntype in your password.\n\n370\n00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:51.080\nYou can't really do that with a script or\nanything,\n\n371\n00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:52.670\nthat's part of that malware protection.\n\n372\n00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:56.310\nSo, system integrity protection, you\ndon't have to know how to configure it,\n\n373\n00:16:56.310 --> 00:16:57.020\nit's already on.\n\n374\n00:16:57.020 --> 00:16:59.710\nBut you do need to be aware of it for\nthe exam.\n\n375\n00:16:59.710 --> 00:17:01.480\n>> Well, Don, I'm glad that that is there.\n\n376\n00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:05.090\nBecause obviously the malicious\npeople that are out there\n\n377\n00:17:05.090 --> 00:17:08.440\ntrying to do their little dark\nmagic against our computers,\n\n378\n00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:11.760\nwell they typically go after us\nbecause we're the low-hanging fruit.\n\n379\n00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:13.550\nWe're usually the problem.\n\n380\n00:17:13.550 --> 00:17:16.223\nWe are having trouble\nwith our passwords or\n\n381\n00:17:16.223 --> 00:17:20.790\n[LAUGH] we're saying hey,\nyou know, I wanna install this.\n\n382\n00:17:20.790 --> 00:17:22.350\nI saw this cool app out on the internet.\n\n383\n00:17:22.350 --> 00:17:25.850\nI'm gonna download it, I'm gonna install\nit, and I'm gonna allow it to install.\n\n384\n00:17:25.850 --> 00:17:30.670\nThey trust that we will say yes to that\nwhen prompted, give our credentials and\n\n385\n00:17:30.670 --> 00:17:31.230\nour blessing.\n\n386\n00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:32.890\nKinda like what you were\nsaying about Apple.\n\n387\n00:17:32.890 --> 00:17:35.610\ngive it our blessing to install and\nnow they got their hooks in us.\n\n388\n00:17:35.610 --> 00:17:40.458\nAnd that being said, going back to\nthe idea of us being our own worst\n\n389\n00:17:40.458 --> 00:17:45.410\nenemy in a lot of cases, the password\nis both our friend and our foe.\n\n390\n00:17:45.410 --> 00:17:49.110\nIt's like we're fighting each other\ntrying to get at the same goal.\n\n391\n00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:51.070\nIt can be really difficult sometimes-\n>> Yeah.\n\n392\n00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:54.110\n>> Passwords are one of the most,\na commonly hated and\n\n393\n00:17:54.110 --> 00:17:56.930\nloved things that we\nuse with our computers.\n\n394\n00:17:56.930 --> 00:18:00.320\n>> Yeah and you know, obviously I screwed\nup my password like 20 times a minute ago\n\n395\n00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:03.560\nbut Apple does actually have\na security feature in Mac OS,\n\n396\n00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:04.695\njust a transition for us.\n\n397\n00:18:04.695 --> 00:18:06.420\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Called the password assistant that is\n\n398\n00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:09.460\nsuppose to help you come\nup with better passwords.\n\n399\n00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:11.750\nA lot of the times end\nusers pick easy passwords.\n\n400\n00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:14.590\nEasy passwords cuz they're easy to\nremember, but if they're easy to remember\n\n401\n00:18:14.590 --> 00:18:17.710\nthey're usually easy to guess also,\nand that makes the system weak.\n\n402\n00:18:17.710 --> 00:18:19.470\nSomebody could figure out\nwhat your password is.\n\n403\n00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:23.790\nSo the password assistant is designed\nto help us get better passwords.\n\n404\n00:18:23.790 --> 00:18:27.260\nAnd you'll see the password assistant pop\nup all sorts of places on the Mac, but\n\n405\n00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:29.230\nthe easiest place to see\nis under a user account.\n\n406\n00:18:29.230 --> 00:18:30.080\nLet me show you what I mean.\n\n407\n00:18:31.250 --> 00:18:35.310\nIf I go into my Mac and,\nI'm going to go into System Preferences,\n\n408\n00:18:35.310 --> 00:18:36.390\ngo into Users and Groups.\n\n409\n00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:38.490\nLet's say I want to create\na User Account for Daniel.\n\n410\n00:18:38.490 --> 00:18:39.070\nRight?\n\n411\n00:18:39.070 --> 00:18:42.630\nSo I'm going to come in here and\nprovide a password.\n\n412\n00:18:42.630 --> 00:18:43.470\nThere we go.\n\n413\n00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:45.920\nAnd I'm going to add a new account for\nDaniel in this system,\n\n414\n00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:47.960\nmaybe I want him to be an administrator.\n\n415\n00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:51.230\nAnd so we'll give him a account.\n\n416\n00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:54.110\nAnd we'll give him an account name.\n\n417\n00:18:54.110 --> 00:18:58.860\nAnd then I can give him an iCloud password\nand have it managed through iCloud or\n\n418\n00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:01.020\nI can have him use a separate password.\n\n419\n00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:03.650\nNow, If I choose iCloud there are some\nbenefits that I'm gonna talk about later\n\n420\n00:19:03.650 --> 00:19:07.700\nlike with multi-factor authentication\nIf I use a separate password,\n\n421\n00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:10.930\njust a stand alone account for\nhim, I can punch in a password.\n\n422\n00:19:10.930 --> 00:19:14.380\nAnd I can put in something secure,\nsomething insecure,\n\n423\n00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:15.540\nsomething easy to guess.\n\n424\n00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:17.880\nI can put one, two, three,\nfour, and it's gonna take it,\n\n425\n00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:19.750\nit's gonna be happy with it, but\n\n426\n00:19:19.750 --> 00:19:25.050\nit's not a good password, but notice this\nlittle key icon that appears right here.\n\n427\n00:19:25.050 --> 00:19:26.820\nThat's the password assistant, and\n\n428\n00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:30.880\nthe password assistant is designed\nto help us make better passwords.\n\n429\n00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:34.020\nIf you click on that key,\nthe password assistant will appear.\n\n430\n00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:42.420\nAnd the way it works is by giving you a\nfew options to generate a better password.\n\n431\n00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:44.260\nThe default is that it's going to try and\n\n432\n00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:48.790\ncreate a password that is memorable Yet\nsecure.\n\n433\n00:19:48.790 --> 00:19:52.110\nIn other words,\na good mix of letters, numbers, and\n\n434\n00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:57.240\nspecial characters, but that's still\nmemorable, and so see what it did.\n\n435\n00:19:57.240 --> 00:20:04.140\nIt took two words that aren't\nreally common like flu, we use flub\n\n436\n00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:09.510\nan unfortunate amount here at ITProTV, but\nwards Words is not a very common word.\n\n437\n00:20:09.510 --> 00:20:12.760\nAnd then there sticking 78* in the middle,\nright.\n\n438\n00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:14.380\nSo we've got letters,\nwe've got numbers and\n\n439\n00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:18.270\nwe've got a special character,\nflub78*wards.\n\n440\n00:20:18.270 --> 00:20:21.560\nThat really wouldn't be that\nhard to remember, right?\n\n441\n00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:23.350\nIt's complex but easy to remember.\n\n442\n00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:25.750\nAt the same time look at the quality.\n\n443\n00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:27.940\nI have a red bar on\nthe quality of this password.\n\n444\n00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:31.910\nSo it's not necessarily as good as it\ncould be I can start to customize it here\n\n445\n00:20:31.910 --> 00:20:32.980\nto make it better.\n\n446\n00:20:32.980 --> 00:20:34.910\nI can increase the length, and\n\n447\n00:20:34.910 --> 00:20:38.560\nas we make it longer,\nlook at that quality go up right?\n\n448\n00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:40.520\nAs I make it longer and longer and\n\n449\n00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:44.445\nlonger until we end up with something\nthat Is pretty hard to remember.\n\n450\n00:20:44.445 --> 00:20:49.731\nSidling97051/arteriorschelorsis which\nis some what morbid.\n\n451\n00:20:49.731 --> 00:20:51.280\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n452\n00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:51.950\n>> So\n\n453\n00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:55.560\nyou know you can pick that if you wanted.\n\n454\n00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:57.210\nThat's just a suggestion.\n\n455\n00:20:57.210 --> 00:20:59.540\nYou can drop it down and\nyou get more suggestions.\n\n456\n00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:03.015\nSo I can pick things that,\nwell those are some really long words,\n\n457\n00:21:03.015 --> 00:21:08.000\nvitamins2(establishmentarianism, which\nat one point was the longest word in\n\n458\n00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:12.900\nthe english language,\nthere's a lot of medical terms.\n\n459\n00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:15.520\nYeah just interesting ones that\nyou can pick from here that\n\n460\n00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:18.390\nare designed to be complex,\nand yet somewhat memorable.\n\n461\n00:21:19.910 --> 00:21:22.200\nThose aren't the only ones that we can do.\n\n462\n00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:24.840\nIf you drop that memorable box down,\nyou'll see there's a few others.\n\n463\n00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:29.800\nWe can do Manual, and Manual's cool\nbecause you can type in your own password,\n\n464\n00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:33.520\nand it'll show you how good it is,\nbut just be careful.\n\n465\n00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:37.600\nPassword is obviously not very secure,\nbut password123, that's great!\n\n466\n00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:39.290\nWell, it's not that great.\n\n467\n00:21:39.290 --> 00:21:41.090\nPeople can guess that one pretty easy.\n\n468\n00:21:41.090 --> 00:21:45.410\nSo the little meter here is only so\naccurate.\n\n469\n00:21:45.410 --> 00:21:48.960\nBut you can pick from other\nthings like letters and numbers.\n\n470\n00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:51.370\nBe careful with letters and\nnumbers, because letters and\n\n471\n00:21:51.370 --> 00:21:53.100\nnumbers really boils down to\nthe length of the password.\n\n472\n00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:54.590\nThe longer you make it,\nthe more secure it is.\n\n473\n00:21:54.590 --> 00:21:58.180\nThe shorter it is, the less secure,\nit's not really all that amazing.\n\n474\n00:21:58.180 --> 00:22:00.040\nNumbers only which is terrible.\n\n475\n00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:02.450\nComputers guess numbers very very quickly.\n\n476\n00:22:02.450 --> 00:22:04.520\nEven for\nlong ones they'll guess it pretty quickly.\n\n477\n00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:08.210\nSo even though the bar might be turning\ngreen it's still not a great password.\n\n478\n00:22:08.210 --> 00:22:12.120\nAnd then you've got a, let's see random.\n\n479\n00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:14.110\nJust a completely random set.\n\n480\n00:22:14.110 --> 00:22:16.860\nThese are usually some of the best\npasswords that we can get.\n\n481\n00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:20.230\nBecause it is letters, numbers,\nuppercase letters, lower case letters,\n\n482\n00:22:20.230 --> 00:22:23.480\nspecial characters really\njust a whole mix in there.\n\n483\n00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:26.020\nAnd then there FIPS-181 compliant.\n\n484\n00:22:26.020 --> 00:22:29.900\nNow, FIPS, that's one of the United States\ngovernment's movements for establishing\n\n485\n00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:35.500\nsecurity And FIPS-181 dictates like\na minimum password requirement.\n\n486\n00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:39.456\nAnd I know that sounds like really\nawesome, Like I'm FIPS-181 secured but\n\n487\n00:22:39.456 --> 00:22:41.930\nFIPS-181 is actually pretty old so\n\n488\n00:22:41.930 --> 00:22:45.030\nwhat you'll see is that it's\njust random letters, no numbers,\n\n489\n00:22:45.030 --> 00:22:47.250\nno special characters,\nno uppercase, just random letters.\n\n490\n00:22:47.250 --> 00:22:49.410\nAnd that means the passwords\nare pretty easy to guess.\n\n491\n00:22:49.410 --> 00:22:51.490\nSo, we might be FIPS 181 compliant but\n\n492\n00:22:51.490 --> 00:22:54.000\nthat doesn't mean we've\ngot a great password.\n\n493\n00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.080\nSo if you Start to strengthen it up.\n\n494\n00:22:56.080 --> 00:23:00.030\nSee how even on these higher\nnumbers I had to get way up there,\n\n495\n00:23:00.030 --> 00:23:02.640\nI had to get to 21 characters\nbefore it became secure.\n\n496\n00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:06.500\nEven at 20 characters, it's still not\nsecure, because it's just random letters\n\n497\n00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:09.170\nand computers can brute\nforce those pretty easy.\n\n498\n00:23:09.170 --> 00:23:11.630\nSo FIPS 181 is not the be all end all.\n\n499\n00:23:11.630 --> 00:23:14.780\nI mean, if you want to make sure the NSA\ncan access your data, then it's great,\n\n500\n00:23:14.780 --> 00:23:15.940\nuse that one.\n\n501\n00:23:15.940 --> 00:23:20.390\nBut if you care about your data\nthen you wanna pick something else.\n\n502\n00:23:20.390 --> 00:23:23.860\nThat's the password assistant, its just\na neat little tool that's built in.\n\n503\n00:23:23.860 --> 00:23:29.900\nIts designed to help users make sure pick\npasswords that are reliable, you know.\n\n504\n00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:31.240\nWe're in Gainesville, Florida and\n\n505\n00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:35.030\nI can guarantee you if we were able to\nlearn the password of everyone in town,\n\n506\n00:23:35.030 --> 00:23:38.460\nGators one, two, three would be like the\npassword or half the people on this town.\n\n507\n00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:42.440\nSo, they could come in here and\ntype that into the password assistant and\n\n508\n00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:46.770\nsee well, I did get in the green but,\nit's still kinda yellow it's not\n\n509\n00:23:46.770 --> 00:23:51.090\nnecessarily the best password I could have\npicked, I need to pick something better.\n\n510\n00:23:51.090 --> 00:23:54.840\n>> The Gainesville area's\ndefinitely ripe for the hacking.\n\n511\n00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:58.000\nSo anybody out there, Gators,\nany derivation thereof,\n\n512\n00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.340\nyou'll definitely be in some systems.\n\n513\n00:24:00.340 --> 00:24:01.928\nNow, Don, we're talking passwords here.\n\n514\n00:24:01.928 --> 00:24:04.225\nObviously, the password is a tried and\n\n515\n00:24:04.225 --> 00:24:08.274\ntrue security measure that we've\nall grown to know and love/hate.\n\n516\n00:24:08.274 --> 00:24:10.928\nAnd now we have the password\nassistant to help us out with that.\n\n517\n00:24:10.928 --> 00:24:14.453\nBut we're living in a modern time\nwhere we've realized the weakness of\n\n518\n00:24:14.453 --> 00:24:18.620\njust using a password and now we're\nmoving to the idea of multifactor, right?\n\n519\n00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:19.210\n>> Absolutely.\n\n520\n00:24:19.210 --> 00:24:21.420\nAnd mutlifactor's really\nwhere you wanna be.\n\n521\n00:24:21.420 --> 00:24:23.240\nNormally, when you log in,\nyou log in with a username and\n\n522\n00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:26.650\na password,\nwell the username is not a security item.\n\n523\n00:24:26.650 --> 00:24:28.150\nThat's something that everybody knows,\nright?\n\n524\n00:24:28.150 --> 00:24:29.920\nYour username is typically\nyour email address,\n\n525\n00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:32.920\nso people know your email address,\nthat's not security.\n\n526\n00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:36.810\nSo, when you log in, technically, the only\nform of authentication you have is your\n\n527\n00:24:36.810 --> 00:24:39.750\npassword, so\nthat's single factor authentication.\n\n528\n00:24:39.750 --> 00:24:43.830\nIf Daniel knows my password, he can log\nin as me, and the computer will think\n\n529\n00:24:43.830 --> 00:24:47.110\nthat he is me because he's got the one\nfactor of authentication that I have.\n\n530\n00:24:47.110 --> 00:24:50.750\nMultifactor is read more than one, and\n\n531\n00:24:50.750 --> 00:24:54.820\nthat more than one,\nit really improves that security level.\n\n532\n00:24:54.820 --> 00:24:58.980\nSo, if you think about other\nforms of authentication,\n\n533\n00:24:58.980 --> 00:25:00.620\nit might be something like biometrics.\n\n534\n00:25:00.620 --> 00:25:03.200\nYou might have a fingerprint scanner,\nright, every iPhone and\n\n535\n00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:04.280\niPad has those today.\n\n536\n00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:07.540\nThey're talking about adding them\nonto the MacBooks, eventually, but\n\n537\n00:25:07.540 --> 00:25:08.530\nthey haven't done it yet.\n\n538\n00:25:08.530 --> 00:25:12.570\nIf you have a MacBook or a Mac Pro,\nyou can get a USB fingerprint reader, and\n\n539\n00:25:12.570 --> 00:25:15.660\nyou can use that as your\nother form of authentication.\n\n540\n00:25:15.660 --> 00:25:18.430\nThere's also other things that you can do,\nthough.\n\n541\n00:25:18.430 --> 00:25:21.780\nAnd a lot of people are starting\nto use access codes or\n\n542\n00:25:21.780 --> 00:25:23.850\nother devices to authenticate your system.\n\n543\n00:25:23.850 --> 00:25:26.060\nAnd Apple has a few options there.\n\n544\n00:25:26.060 --> 00:25:29.294\nNone of which are baked into Mac OS alone.\n\n545\n00:25:29.294 --> 00:25:33.367\nThey all rely on a second thing,\nwhich is your Apple ID.\n\n546\n00:25:33.367 --> 00:25:35.541\nAlmost everybody has\nan Apple ID these days.\n\n547\n00:25:35.541 --> 00:25:38.724\nIf you bought a single app out of\nthe app store, you've got an Apple ID.\n\n548\n00:25:38.724 --> 00:25:41.630\nAnd your Apple ID is stored\nup on Apple servers.\n\n549\n00:25:41.630 --> 00:25:42.640\nAnd so, you can say,\n\n550\n00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:46.560\nwhen I log into my laptop, instead of\nlogging into my local account, that only\n\n551\n00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:51.240\nsupports single factor authentication,\nI can log in with my iTunes account.\n\n552\n00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:56.015\nAnd when I login with the iTunes account,\nnow I use their authentication.\n\n553\n00:25:56.015 --> 00:25:59.635\nAnd iTunes supports two different\nforms of multifactor authentication.\n\n554\n00:25:59.635 --> 00:26:02.720\nAll right,\none is where you get email verifications.\n\n555\n00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:05.560\nSo anytime you try and login, you get\nan email, and you gotta verify the email.\n\n556\n00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:06.950\nWell that's not a very good one.\n\n557\n00:26:06.950 --> 00:26:09.130\nIt's not very timely and\nit slows things down.\n\n558\n00:26:09.130 --> 00:26:12.990\nSo the one they really recommend is\nwhat's called device authentication,\n\n559\n00:26:12.990 --> 00:26:17.480\nwhere you have trusted devices,\ndevices that are part of your Apple ID.\n\n560\n00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:21.720\nSo, for example,\nmy iPhone is trusted on my Apple ID.\n\n561\n00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:26.100\nSo if I log in on a desktop with my\nApple ID, I get a message on my phone,\n\n562\n00:26:26.100 --> 00:26:29.470\na little pop up that says,\nyou're trying to log in on this device,\n\n563\n00:26:29.470 --> 00:26:31.830\ndo you trust it, and I say, okay.\n\n564\n00:26:31.830 --> 00:26:34.350\nSo, for\nsomebody to log in as me with my Apple ID,\n\n565\n00:26:34.350 --> 00:26:37.370\nthey have to know my password, and\nthey have to have my cell phone.\n\n566\n00:26:37.370 --> 00:26:41.170\nThey have to have my cell phone to\nbe able to accept that join message.\n\n567\n00:26:41.170 --> 00:26:44.740\nAll right, if they don't have both of\nthose devices, they can't log in as me.\n\n568\n00:26:44.740 --> 00:26:46.760\nThat's multifactor authentication.\n\n569\n00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:49.640\nSo, if you want to use\nmultifactor authentication,\n\n570\n00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:51.030\nyou have to use an Apple ID.\n\n571\n00:26:51.030 --> 00:26:53.770\nAnd let me just show you real quick,\nwhen we set up,\n\n572\n00:26:53.770 --> 00:26:55.350\nI'm just gonna cancel this real quick.\n\n573\n00:26:55.350 --> 00:26:58.980\nWhen we set up a new user account,\nit's one of the questions it asks us.\n\n574\n00:26:58.980 --> 00:27:02.080\nWhen you go to create that account,\nit asks the password,\n\n575\n00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:05.990\nis it going to be an iCloud password or\na separate password?\n\n576\n00:27:05.990 --> 00:27:11.350\nAnd if you choose iCloud, that's where\nyou put in that iCloud ID, and now\n\n577\n00:27:11.350 --> 00:27:15.390\nyou can set up that user, and now you'll\nbe able to log in with the iCloud ID.\n\n578\n00:27:15.390 --> 00:27:19.220\nAnd if your Apple ID has multifactor\nauthentication turned on,\n\n579\n00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:21.140\nyou're now using it for your Mac, also.\n\n580\n00:27:21.140 --> 00:27:21.710\nAll right?\n\n581\n00:27:21.710 --> 00:27:24.000\nSo while it's not supporting\nregular accounts,\n\n582\n00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:27.490\nthe ones with separate passwords,\nit is included with the iCloud ones.\n\n583\n00:27:27.490 --> 00:27:28.620\nSo we need to have that.\n\n584\n00:27:28.620 --> 00:27:30.282\nAll right?\nNow if you've already created your\n\n585\n00:27:30.282 --> 00:27:33.010\naccount, like I have, if we take\na look at like, Don Pezet, here.\n\n586\n00:27:33.010 --> 00:27:35.697\nAnd I go to change my password.\n\n587\n00:27:35.697 --> 00:27:37.079\nI'm a local account now, right?\n\n588\n00:27:37.079 --> 00:27:40.343\nSo I've already been made, if I want\nto switch over to an iCloud account,\n\n589\n00:27:40.343 --> 00:27:42.820\nI would need to create another account for\nme.\n\n590\n00:27:42.820 --> 00:27:48.260\nEven though I might have gone here and\ngone into iCloud and configured it.\n\n591\n00:27:48.260 --> 00:27:51.910\nWell, they actually introduced\na new little wizard where if you\n\n592\n00:27:51.910 --> 00:27:54.870\npunch in your username and password, it'll\ngive you a chance to convert over and\n\n593\n00:27:54.870 --> 00:27:55.980\nsay, would you like to log in with this?\n\n594\n00:27:55.980 --> 00:27:58.360\nSo we can kind of switch\ngears after the fact.\n\n595\n00:27:58.360 --> 00:28:00.640\nOften times, it's easier just to\nmake a second account though, so\n\n596\n00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:01.700\nyou can go either way.\n\n597\n00:28:01.700 --> 00:28:04.630\nBut now we can get connected and\nattach that iCloud account.\n\n598\n00:28:04.630 --> 00:28:08.149\nThat's important because it's the only\nway that Apple supports doing multifactor\n\n599\n00:28:08.149 --> 00:28:10.690\nauthentication on their\ndesktops right now.\n\n600\n00:28:10.690 --> 00:28:14.150\nOn your phone and on your tablet,\nyou can use Touch ID and a password.\n\n601\n00:28:14.150 --> 00:28:17.540\nYou can do multifactor, but on a desktop,\nyou gotta use your iCloud ID.\n\n602\n00:28:18.910 --> 00:28:22.660\nAll right, so, that's about it for\ntwo factor authentication.\n\n603\n00:28:22.660 --> 00:28:23.830\nLet's see, how much time do we have left?\n\n604\n00:28:23.830 --> 00:28:26.220\nWell, we probably don't have\nenough time for the next one.\n\n605\n00:28:26.220 --> 00:28:28.980\nI've got a whole, I mean,\nall this stuff here,\n\n606\n00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:30.520\nof security features\nwe want to go through.\n\n607\n00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:32.630\nAnd we've only talked\nabout a couple of them.\n\n608\n00:28:32.630 --> 00:28:34.590\nWe talked about, what did we start with?\n\n609\n00:28:34.590 --> 00:28:37.720\nWe did system integrity protection.\n\n610\n00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:39.890\nWe talked a bit about\nthe password assistant and\n\n611\n00:28:39.890 --> 00:28:41.890\nwe talked about multifactor\nauthentication.\n\n612\n00:28:41.890 --> 00:28:45.428\nI've still got building of the firewall,\nwe've got gate keeper,\n\n613\n00:28:45.428 --> 00:28:49.773\nwe've got file vault, we've got all sorts\nof other really cool security features\n\n614\n00:28:49.773 --> 00:28:52.400\nthat we're just gonna have\nto tackle in part two.\n\n615\n00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:55.620\n>> Well, you know, when you got a bunch\nof great bevy of interesting topics\n\n616\n00:28:55.620 --> 00:28:58.170\nlike that, especially when it comes\nto security, it's just best for\n\n617\n00:28:58.170 --> 00:29:01.490\nus to take them as they need and\ngive them the time that they require.\n\n618\n00:29:01.490 --> 00:29:03.100\nSo, Don, thanks for joining us today.\n\n619\n00:29:03.100 --> 00:29:04.410\nLook forward to seeing you in part two,\n\n620\n00:29:04.410 --> 00:29:06.610\nhopefully we'll see you\nguys there as well.\n\n621\n00:29:06.610 --> 00:29:09.150\nLooks like for this episode,\nthough, we're gonna call it a wrap.\n\n622\n00:29:09.150 --> 00:29:12.030\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowery.\n\n623\n00:29:12.030 --> 00:29:12.780\n>> And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n624\n00:29:12.780 --> 00:29:13.786\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n625\n00:29:13.786 --> 00:29:22.300\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

TV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.373 --> 00:00:18.080\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\n\n4\n00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.870\nin today's episode we are continuing on\nwith our Mac integration basic series.\n\n5\n00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:23.530\nJoining us back in\nthe studio again today for\n\n6\n00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:27.150\na part two on security, is none other\nthan our good friend, Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n7\n00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.700\nDon, welcome back to the show, sir.\n\n8\n00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.680\n>> I am glad to be back, and glad to\ncontinue on with my endless ramblings\n\n9\n00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.780\nabout the security\nfeatures inside of Mac OS.\n\n10\n00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:36.010\nFor those of you who\nwatched the first part,\n\n11\n00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.540\nyou know we got to see some great\ntechnologies that were all baked into\n\n12\n00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.010\nthe operating system.\n\n13\n00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:42.920\nMost of which are just already turned on\nfor us, we didn't have to turn them on.\n\n14\n00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.180\nWe're gonna continue with that but this\ntime we're gonna look at a few features\n\n15\n00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.320\nthat we do have to turn on, some things\nthat we might need to get configured.\n\n16\n00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.290\nAnd just kinda continuing that spirit of\ncool stuff behind the scenes in Mac OS.\n\n17\n00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:58.440\nNow the first one I wanna talk about is\nsomething that it's kind of important\n\n18\n00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.960\nthat if you're a home user.\n\n19\n00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.930\nIf you're just somebody who has one\nMac and then you use it and that's it.\n\n20\n00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.230\nYou might not worry about, but\n\n21\n00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:06.620\nin a corporate environment\nit's pretty important.\n\n22\n00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.110\nAnd that's called the screen lock.\n\n23\n00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.420\nThere's a number of sophisticated\nhacks and exploits out there.\n\n24\n00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.130\nPeople can try and guess your password\nwith brute force mechanisms and\n\n25\n00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.010\nall this crazy technology.\n\n26\n00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:23.660\nBut at the end of day, if I'm logged into\nmy computer and I get up and walk away.\n\n27\n00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.690\nIt doesn't take a rocket scientist to\nfigure out they can sit down at my\n\n28\n00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:28.310\ncomputer I'm already logged in.\n\n29\n00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:33.140\nAnd when you walk away from your computer\nyou're leaving the door wide open.\n\n30\n00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.088\nWhen you leave your house in the morning\nyou turn around and you lock that door.\n\n31\n00:01:36.088 --> 00:01:39.060\nAnd you walk away,\nyou know that your home is locked.\n\n32\n00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.110\nBut when you walk away from a computer,\na lot of people don't think about it.\n\n33\n00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:43.260\nThey just walk away from it and\n\n34\n00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.310\nthe computer's logged in,\nanybody can sit down.\n\n35\n00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.310\nNow we have this running joke\nkinda here in the office where.\n\n36\n00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.520\nDaniel, I think you've\nlearned this firsthand,\n\n37\n00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.680\nthat if you walk away from that\ncomputer and leave it unlocked,\n\n38\n00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.920\nyou come back, you're gonna have\na My Little Pony wallpaper.\n\n39\n00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.111\n>> Yes,\nyou'll become a brony really quick.\n\n40\n00:01:59.111 --> 00:02:00.900\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] And\n\n41\n00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.580\nI think we've seeing Rainbow Brite,\nwe've seen the Backstreet Boys.\n\n42\n00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:04.260\nThere's all sorts of stuff.\n\n43\n00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.347\n>> Winnie the Pooh was a favorite for\na while [LAUGH]\n\n44\n00:02:07.347 --> 00:02:08.782\n>> [LAUGH] So anyway,\n\n45\n00:02:08.782 --> 00:02:12.420\nyou kinda learn like when I walk away from\na computer, I probably don't wanna leave\n\n46\n00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.210\nthat screen unlocked because\nsomebody else could use it.\n\n47\n00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:18.090\nNow, that's just wallpaper,\nthat's us having fun, but\n\n48\n00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.840\nit could be far more serious, right?\n\n49\n00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.060\nSomebody could walk up to your computer,\nsit down,\n\n50\n00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.900\ngrab all your sensitive documents and\ne-mail them as an attachment.\n\n51\n00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.700\nOr send false e-mails as you,\non your behalf,\n\n52\n00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.148\nbecause they're sitting at your computer.\n\n53\n00:02:29.148 --> 00:02:32.670\nHaving a screen lock solves that, okay?\n\n54\n00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.030\nNow, the screen lock,\nIt can work two ways.\n\n55\n00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.410\nThere can be an automatic screen lock and\na manual screen lock.\n\n56\n00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.160\nAnd on the automatic side,\nit's tied to our screen saver.\n\n57\n00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:43.820\nYou can set a screen saver on your\ncomputer where if your computer sits\n\n58\n00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:45.790\nidle for long enough,\nthe screen saver comes up.\n\n59\n00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.830\nNow back in the 1980s and even in\nthe 1990s, screen savers were commonplace.\n\n60\n00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.280\nPeople were buying custom screen savers.\n\n61\n00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.360\nYou remember the toasters with wings and\nall that stuff.\n\n62\n00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.080\nPeople would buy that stuff.\n\n63\n00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:00.330\nBecause the old CRT monitors would burn\nin if they showed the same image for\n\n64\n00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:01.400\ntoo long.\n\n65\n00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.270\nOn modern day LED and LCD screens,\nwe don't have that problem.\n\n66\n00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:08.570\nIt takes them, you know, an image has\nto be on the screen for months and\n\n67\n00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:10.190\nmonths before it burns in.\n\n68\n00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.550\nSo modern monitors don't have\nthat problem and less and\n\n69\n00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:14.520\nless people use screen savers.\n\n70\n00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.570\nBut they're still useful,\nbecause if your computer idles for a while\n\n71\n00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:23.720\nit can cut to a screen saver and then when\nyou wake it up you can require a password.\n\n72\n00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.390\nThat way if somebody comes up behind\nit after you walk away from your\n\n73\n00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:27.715\ndesk and they sit down.\n\n74\n00:03:27.715 --> 00:03:30.155\nThey can't use it without\nproviding your password, right?\n\n75\n00:03:30.155 --> 00:03:31.845\nBut we've gotta turn\nthat on if we want it.\n\n76\n00:03:31.845 --> 00:03:33.715\nAnd fortunately it's not that hard to do,\n\n77\n00:03:33.715 --> 00:03:35.755\nwe just need to jump into our settings and\nenable it.\n\n78\n00:03:35.755 --> 00:03:39.015\nSo I've got a Mac here that's fired up,\nand I just wanna jump in and\n\n79\n00:03:39.015 --> 00:03:40.915\nkinda set some of this stuff.\n\n80\n00:03:40.915 --> 00:03:42.375\nSetting a screen timeout or\n\n81\n00:03:42.375 --> 00:03:46.215\na screen saver is easy enough,\nwe just go into our System Preferences.\n\n82\n00:03:46.215 --> 00:03:50.960\nAnd in our System Preferences, you've\nactually got a few different options but\n\n83\n00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:53.760\nthe one I want is under\nSecurity & Privacy, right here.\n\n84\n00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.330\nSo if I jump under Security & Privacy,\n\n85\n00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:00.090\nhere's where we're gonna have a log in\npassword has been set for the user,\n\n86\n00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:05.790\nrequire a password five minutes after\nsleep or screen saver begins, all right.\n\n87\n00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:08.500\nNotice it's doing sleep and screensaver.\n\n88\n00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.150\nSome people don't bother\nwith the screensaver,\n\n89\n00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:11.766\nthey have their screen go\nto sleep to save power.\n\n90\n00:04:11.766 --> 00:04:14.414\nWe see that on laptops and\nstuff, and we can set it.\n\n91\n00:04:14.414 --> 00:04:18.616\nNow, the default here, cuz I didn't turn\nthis on, this is the default setting.\n\n92\n00:04:18.616 --> 00:04:23.580\nRequire the password five minutes\nafter that screensaver sleep happens.\n\n93\n00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:27.840\nWell, if I get up and\nI walk away from my computer,\n\n94\n00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.270\nhow long is it gonna be before sleep or\nscreen saver happens?\n\n95\n00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:32.560\nI don't know, right?\n\n96\n00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.080\nI might have my screen saver not\nset to come up for 30 minutes.\n\n97\n00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:37.410\nSo now 30 minutes goes by.\n\n98\n00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:39.190\nAnd then the screen saver kicks in and\n\n99\n00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:43.040\nthen it's another five minutes\nbefore it even requires a password.\n\n100\n00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:45.090\nThat's a long, long time.\n\n101\n00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:49.080\nSo one of the things that I recommend\nis shortening that to immediately.\n\n102\n00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:50.350\nIf the computer goes to sleep or\n\n103\n00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:55.350\nthe screen saver kicks on,\nimmediately make it require a password.\n\n104\n00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:58.140\nOtherwise the screen saver could be up,\nsomebody hits the mouse, and\n\n105\n00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:00.360\nit wakes up and\nit doesn't ask for that password.\n\n106\n00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.190\nSo we wanna make sure that we\nadjust that if we need it.\n\n107\n00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:06.730\nNow, if you go back here to your main\nscreen, you've got our Settings,\n\n108\n00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:09.720\nwe've got Desktop &\nScreen Saver right here.\n\n109\n00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.830\nAnd that's we're we gonna\nset our screen saver.\n\n110\n00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:14.740\nAnd so you'll see mine's set to\nhave a picture screen saver.\n\n111\n00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:17.940\nAnd that's really all I've got,\nsorry that's my desktop.\n\n112\n00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:18.670\nLet me get to the right tab.\n\n113\n00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:19.310\nThere you go.\n\n114\n00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:21.620\nSo I've got a picture screen saver set and\nit's,\n\n115\n00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:24.500\nactually I've got the weird\nsquiggly aurora lines.\n\n116\n00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:25.580\nThat's it.\n\n117\n00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:28.020\nAnd it's set to start after 20 minutes.\n\n118\n00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:30.020\nSo, if I walk away from my computer,\n\n119\n00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:33.800\nit's actually gonna be 25 minutes\nbefore it requires a password.\n\n120\n00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:35.780\nThat's a long time, 25 minutes.\n\n121\n00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:38.180\nSo, I may want to set a shorter\nscreen saver timeout.\n\n122\n00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:41.900\nI might want to set\na faster password lock.\n\n123\n00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:43.540\nI might want to adjust both of those.\n\n124\n00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:47.445\nSo I might say hey, if I sit idle for 10\nminutes, make that screen saver kick on.\n\n125\n00:05:47.445 --> 00:05:51.951\nAnd then I can go back and\nI can go into my Security & Privacy and\n\n126\n00:05:51.951 --> 00:05:55.520\nI can make it require\na password immediately.\n\n127\n00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:59.370\nRight, don't wait do it right now,\nrequire that password.\n\n128\n00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:03.170\n>> Now Don if this is basically allowing\nanybody that walks up after you to\n\n129\n00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:04.730\njust jump on your computer.\n\n130\n00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:06.100\nAnd start making changes.\n\n131\n00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:08.630\nMaybe add a, maybe a keystroke logger.\n\n132\n00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:09.815\nThat'd be a fun idea, right?\n\n133\n00:06:09.815 --> 00:06:11.260\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And you do can that so easily.\n\n134\n00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.930\nSomebody walks away from their\ncomputer and it's not locking.\n\n135\n00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:17.570\nWhy would they set it to be 20 minutes\nbefore the screen saver comes on, and\n\n136\n00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:21.630\nthen 5 minutes before\nthe password kicks in by default?\n\n137\n00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:25.570\n>> So, what happens is maybe you're,\nmaybe you're on a webpage.\n\n138\n00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:28.070\nAnd you're reading this web page and\nit's a ton of data.\n\n139\n00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:30.090\nAnd so you're just sitting there reading.\n\n140\n00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:32.150\nAnd 20 minutes goes by, and\nyou're still reading, and\n\n141\n00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:33.570\nyou haven't touched your mouse or\nyour screen.\n\n142\n00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:35.820\nNow, 20 minutes is a long time,\nbut maybe you're a slow reader.\n\n143\n00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:38.235\nSo [LAUGH] it's just a long time.\n\n144\n00:06:38.235 --> 00:06:40.291\nOr maybe you're watching a video.\n\n145\n00:06:40.291 --> 00:06:43.229\nYou're on YouTube, and\nyou're watching a video.\n\n146\n00:06:43.229 --> 00:06:46.110\nAnd the 20th minute rolls by\n>> And the screensaver kicks on.\n\n147\n00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:47.420\nAnd you're like, ag shoot.\n\n148\n00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:48.470\nAnd you hit your mouse.\n\n149\n00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:50.400\nAnd the screensaver goes away.\n\n150\n00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:53.360\nIt's not gonna ask for a password\ncuz the screensaver just came up.\n\n151\n00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:54.600\nIt gives you that five minute window.\n\n152\n00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:55.750\nAnd now I think that's too long.\n\n153\n00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:57.070\nYou want to shorten that.\n\n154\n00:06:57.070 --> 00:06:57.780\nBut that's the default.\n\n155\n00:06:57.780 --> 00:06:58.660\nAnd that's kind of the thinking.\n\n156\n00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:00.760\nThat's the logic behind it.\n\n157\n00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:02.960\nApple wants to improve security but\n\n158\n00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:06.150\nat the same time not\ninconvenience the average Joe.\n\n159\n00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:07.820\nAnd so that's what those settings are.\n\n160\n00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:10.180\nBut in a corporate environment,\nyou're not the average Joe.\n\n161\n00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:13.110\nYou're somebody who has sensitive data and\nyou don't want to rely on that.\n\n162\n00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:16.590\nNow, one thing I didn't mention was,\nwe saw the screen saver timeout.\n\n163\n00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:17.890\nBut what about sleep timer?\n\n164\n00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:20.160\nYou have the sleep timer too,\nit's in a different place.\n\n165\n00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:23.596\nI went to desktop and\nscreen saver for the screen saver.\n\n166\n00:07:23.596 --> 00:07:27.850\nUnder Energy Saver is where we go for\nthe sleep timer.\n\n167\n00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:31.560\nAnd notice my computer sleep\ntime is set to ten minutes.\n\n168\n00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:33.570\nSo at ten minutes, it's gonna go to sleep.\n\n169\n00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:36.840\nMy screen saver is set to ten minutes, I'm\nactually never gonna see the screen saver\n\n170\n00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:39.000\nhere since in ten minutes\nthe computer will go to sleep.\n\n171\n00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.580\nAnd I have my password set to immediate,\nI can shorten that but\n\n172\n00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:44.430\nthat'll probably annoy the heck\noutta me so I'll leave it be.\n\n173\n00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.850\nAll right, so those are some of\nthe different things that we can adjust.\n\n174\n00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:50.980\nActually I'm gonna bump that up cuz I\ndon't want it going to sleep while I'm\n\n175\n00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:53.460\nhere in the show, cuz that'll annoy me.\n\n176\n00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:55.708\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and change that,\nand get it kinda put there.\n\n177\n00:07:55.708 --> 00:07:59.074\nAll right,\nnow those are gonna be automatic.\n\n178\n00:07:59.074 --> 00:08:02.906\nRight now if I idle for ten minutes,\nmy screen saver's gonna kick on.\n\n179\n00:08:02.906 --> 00:08:06.802\nAs soon as that screensaver kicks on,\nif somebody tries to wake it up,\n\n180\n00:08:06.802 --> 00:08:08.660\nit's gonna require a password.\n\n181\n00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:09.369\nSo if I get up and\n\n182\n00:08:09.369 --> 00:08:14.080\nwalk away, now there's only a 10 minute\nwindow that somebody can jump in there.\n\n183\n00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:16.160\nBut I don't like that, right?\n\n184\n00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:18.360\nWhat if I'm in the middle of something and\n\n185\n00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:21.380\nI'm ssh'd into three\nservers with root access.\n\n186\n00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:25.500\nAnd I've got some terminals open and some\nremote desktop sessions and other things.\n\n187\n00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:28.890\nI've got tools that are open that\npeople could do a lot of damage with.\n\n188\n00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:31.010\nI don't even wanna wait ten minutes,\nright?\n\n189\n00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:34.720\nSo let me show you guys a little trick\non how we can manually lock the screen.\n\n190\n00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:39.376\nNow these little screen locks that we saw\nwere dependent upon the screensaver and\n\n191\n00:08:39.376 --> 00:08:40.411\nthe sleep timer.\n\n192\n00:08:40.411 --> 00:08:42.043\nAnd I don't wanna set those too fast or\n\n193\n00:08:42.043 --> 00:08:44.950\nevery time I sit there reading\nan email it's gonna lock the screen.\n\n194\n00:08:44.950 --> 00:08:48.810\nSo I need it to be at least five\nminutes maybe even longer, right?\n\n195\n00:08:48.810 --> 00:08:52.622\nBut we can do it manually too by\nusing the keychain access program.\n\n196\n00:08:52.622 --> 00:08:55.702\nThe keychain,\nmost of us never mess with the key chain.\n\n197\n00:08:55.702 --> 00:08:58.040\nThe keychain runs in the background,\nit's a little database and\n\n198\n00:08:58.040 --> 00:08:59.900\nit's what stores your usernames and\npasswords.\n\n199\n00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:03.270\nWhen you access a network server like\nwe did in the file sharing episode,\n\n200\n00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:06.510\nI chose to save my password in\nthe keychain, stored in that database.\n\n201\n00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:08.240\nOr when you go to a website in Safari and\n\n202\n00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:10.600\nit saves a password,\nit's in your keychain.\n\n203\n00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:13.560\nYour wireless networks, their\npasswords are stored in the keychain.\n\n204\n00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:16.160\nSo the keychain is pretty sensitive,\nit's got a bunch of passwords in it.\n\n205\n00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:19.000\nYou don't want just anybody being\nable to get access to your keychain.\n\n206\n00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.550\nSo the keychain actually provides the\nfunctionality to lock the computer too.\n\n207\n00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:24.130\nIt's another way to go about it.\n\n208\n00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:27.510\nSo I'm gonna launch my keychain\nutility which is keychain access.\n\n209\n00:09:27.510 --> 00:09:30.010\nIt's in the Utilities folder\nin your applications.\n\n210\n00:09:30.010 --> 00:09:33.020\nAnd here you can start to see some\nof the passwords that I've saved.\n\n211\n00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:37.609\nAnd so we'll start to see information\nhere about iMessage encryption keys and\n\n212\n00:09:37.609 --> 00:09:39.356\nthere's win-client01.\n\n213\n00:09:39.356 --> 00:09:42.284\nThose are the credentials I used for\naccessing that workstation in the other\n\n214\n00:09:42.284 --> 00:09:44.190\nepisode if you've been\nwatching all of them.\n\n215\n00:09:44.190 --> 00:09:46.570\nSo, this is where that stuff gets saved.\n\n216\n00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:48.800\nWell, if I go up here\nto Keychain Access and\n\n217\n00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:54.200\nPreferences, I've got this option to show\nthe keychain status in the menu bar.\n\n218\n00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:56.310\nI'm gonna check that, all right?\n\n219\n00:09:56.310 --> 00:10:01.490\nAnd what it does is it makes this\nlittle lock appear up here in my bar.\n\n220\n00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:03.320\nAnd still it's unlocked.\n\n221\n00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:06.200\nIt's unlocked because well,\nmaybe you can't see that, let me try and\n\n222\n00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:07.390\nget a little closer, there we go.\n\n223\n00:10:07.390 --> 00:10:09.441\nIt's unlocked because I'm logged in.\n\n224\n00:10:09.441 --> 00:10:11.844\nI'm logged in and my keychain is open.\n\n225\n00:10:11.844 --> 00:10:14.112\nSo when I go to websites in Safari or\nI browse the network,\n\n226\n00:10:14.112 --> 00:10:17.270\nthe passwords are available and\nit's able to access it.\n\n227\n00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:19.500\nBut when I walk away from the computer,\n\n228\n00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:21.990\nI don't want people to be\nable to use my keychain.\n\n229\n00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:22.866\nRight, that would be bad.\n\n230\n00:10:22.866 --> 00:10:25.710\nThat's really kind of ruin everything,\nright?\n\n231\n00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:28.780\nSo by displaying it in the menu bar\nit gives me a neat little function.\n\n232\n00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:33.560\nI'm gonna get out of the keychain and\nsee how the lock stays right there.\n\n233\n00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:37.570\nAnd if I'm about to get up all I\nhave to do is hit that lock and\n\n234\n00:10:37.570 --> 00:10:38.680\nI can choose to lock the screen.\n\n235\n00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:41.920\nI can lock just the keychain,\nbut I want to lock my screen.\n\n236\n00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:44.140\nAnd this is what I do on my own computer.\n\n237\n00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:47.760\nSo everyday when I get up out of\nthe office and I go to the restroom,\n\n238\n00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:49.490\ngo to get a cup of coffee or whatever.\n\n239\n00:10:49.490 --> 00:10:53.860\nI just hit my little lock and\nI hit lock screen and it locks it and\n\n240\n00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:55.330\nit locks it immediately.\n\n241\n00:10:56.330 --> 00:10:58.210\nI say immediately, what is it doing?\n\n242\n00:10:58.210 --> 00:11:02.460\nJust kind of sitting there, [LAUGH]\nit's suppose to lock it immediately.\n\n243\n00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:07.270\nAnd then [LAUGH] it's locked and\nthen somebody can't access it.\n\n244\n00:11:07.270 --> 00:11:08.410\nWhat the heck have I done.\n\n245\n00:11:08.410 --> 00:11:10.440\nWell, you know what,\nlet me show you on my real computer.\n\n246\n00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:11.120\nThere we go.\n\n247\n00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:14.080\nSo that's one of my lab machines,\nthis is my real laptop right here and\n\n248\n00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:17.200\nthis is I'm running El Capitan.\n\n249\n00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:19.420\nWhich is important and\nsince that's what the show is all about.\n\n250\n00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:23.820\nSo I'm running El Capitan and\non my real honest to goodness laptop,\n\n251\n00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:26.390\nyou can see right up\nhere I've got that lock.\n\n252\n00:11:26.390 --> 00:11:30.100\nThat's that keychain access that I was\njust talking about and I can hit that and\n\n253\n00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:31.960\nI can choose to lock the screen.\n\n254\n00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:32.760\nAnd what do I get?\n\n255\n00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:36.660\nI get a black screen, and\nif somebody were to walk up and try and\n\n256\n00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:38.760\nget to it, it's at the login prompt.\n\n257\n00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:39.290\nRight?\n\n258\n00:11:39.290 --> 00:11:40.342\nSo now I can walk away.\n\n259\n00:11:40.342 --> 00:11:42.940\nThe screensaver hasn't turned on,\nthe computer hasn't gone to sleep.\n\n260\n00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:46.310\nEverything's up and running and\nI'm in the restroom.\n\n261\n00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:49.160\nDaniel comes over to use my computer and\nit's already locked.\n\n262\n00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:50.940\nIf he knows my password\nhe can punch it in.\n\n263\n00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:53.590\nAnd there he goes, he's in, right?\n\n264\n00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:54.920\nIf you know my password.\n\n265\n00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:55.950\nThere's always that problem.\n\n266\n00:11:55.950 --> 00:11:57.628\nIf they know your password, then one\nof this stuff really matters, right?\n\n267\n00:11:57.628 --> 00:12:02.726\nBut if they don't know my password, this\nprevents somebody from tailgating, right?\n\n268\n00:12:02.726 --> 00:12:05.530\nI get up and walk away, they jump\nright in and get on that computer.\n\n269\n00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:08.940\n>> Now Don, would you say that obviously\nwe have two different ways of locking this\n\n270\n00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:09.550\nscreen now.\n\n271\n00:12:09.550 --> 00:12:13.060\nWe have the automatic lock that we\ncan set using the screensaver and\n\n272\n00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:16.070\nthe sleep function and\nmaking it require a password.\n\n273\n00:12:16.070 --> 00:12:18.390\nWhen you're ready to jump back on,\nyou move the mouse or\n\n274\n00:12:18.390 --> 00:12:19.540\nsomething and it jumps up.\n\n275\n00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:22.115\nAnd you also have the little\nlock icon in the top.\n\n276\n00:12:22.115 --> 00:12:26.996\nWould you say it's the best practice\nwould be to use the lock icon as much as\n\n277\n00:12:26.996 --> 00:12:27.800\npossible?\n\n278\n00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:29.270\nGet that to become habit and\n\n279\n00:12:29.270 --> 00:12:34.490\nthen using your automatic lock on or\nthe lock as a backup?\n\n280\n00:12:34.490 --> 00:12:36.810\n>> Yes, that's usually how I have it set.\n\n281\n00:12:36.810 --> 00:12:40.245\nI do shorten the screensaver and\nsleep timers in case I forget.\n\n282\n00:12:40.245 --> 00:12:42.300\nCuz I had to do that manual,\nI had to manual hit that lock.\n\n283\n00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:44.300\nAnd if I ever forget,\nI wanna have that backup.\n\n284\n00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:45.560\nBut I usually use lock.\n\n285\n00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:48.100\nThere's one scenario where it's not so\ngood.\n\n286\n00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:49.800\nWhat if I share the computer?\n\n287\n00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:51.570\nRight?\nWhat if I've got a shared computer and\n\n288\n00:12:51.570 --> 00:12:52.800\nDaniel and I both use it?\n\n289\n00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:53.780\nOr my wife?\n\n290\n00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:54.950\nI let her use it.\n\n291\n00:12:54.950 --> 00:12:56.200\nWell, if I lock the screen and\n\n292\n00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:59.650\nwalk away, she's gotta know my\npassword to use the computer.\n\n293\n00:12:59.650 --> 00:13:01.240\nI don't wanna share a password.\n\n294\n00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:05.230\nSo there is another option and\nit's called fast user switching.\n\n295\n00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:07.830\nFast user switching is\nactually disabled by default.\n\n296\n00:13:07.830 --> 00:13:10.900\nIf you have more than one user\naccount in your computer though,\n\n297\n00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:13.960\nyou can actually be logged in as\nmore than one person at a time.\n\n298\n00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:17.160\nRight now I'm logged in as Don Pezet,\nif I were to log out, like here,\n\n299\n00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:18.170\nlet me log out.\n\n300\n00:13:18.170 --> 00:13:19.520\nAnd get to my log out screen.\n\n301\n00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:22.610\nSo when I go to log in to this computer,\nit's only got one user account.\n\n302\n00:13:22.610 --> 00:13:24.710\nRight there, Don Pezet, you see me.\n\n303\n00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:25.940\nIf I try and back out of that,\n\n304\n00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:28.790\nit doesn't really matter cuz that's\nthe only account that I've got.\n\n305\n00:13:28.790 --> 00:13:31.890\nAnd so I can log in and it's me.\n\n306\n00:13:31.890 --> 00:13:36.020\nBut if it's a shared computer,\nI might want to stay logged in, but\n\n307\n00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:37.930\nlet somebody else log in also.\n\n308\n00:13:37.930 --> 00:13:40.020\nMaybe I have some program\nI wanna keep running, but\n\n309\n00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:42.030\nI wanna let Daniel go ahead and\nuse the computer.\n\n310\n00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:44.150\nWell, I want to have two\npeople logged in at once and\n\n311\n00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:46.140\nfast user switching lets me do that.\n\n312\n00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:47.870\nSo I'm gonna jump into my\nsystem preferences and\n\n313\n00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:49.490\nlet me just add another\naccount here real quick.\n\n314\n00:13:49.490 --> 00:13:56.640\nI'm gonna add an account for Daniel, and\nonce I've done that I will have two users.\n\n315\n00:13:56.640 --> 00:14:00.130\nSo I'm gonna add in, I'll make you\nan admin, Daniel, we'll go crazy.\n\n316\n00:14:01.570 --> 00:14:02.660\n>> You're a brave man, Don.\n\n317\n00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:03.680\n>> I know.\nWho knows?\n\n318\n00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:05.640\nThis machine won't be running tomorrow,\nbut\n\n319\n00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:07.306\nat least for a few moments it will work.\n\n320\n00:14:07.306 --> 00:14:11.288\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and create that\naccount for him and punch that in, right?\n\n321\n00:14:11.288 --> 00:14:15.040\nSo, now there's two users on this system,\nright?\n\n322\n00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:17.390\nSo you've got me and\nyou've got this new account for Daniel.\n\n323\n00:14:17.390 --> 00:14:19.480\nTwo accounts, right?\n\n324\n00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:24.450\nNow, when somebody goes to log in,\nthey log in as their account and\n\n325\n00:14:24.450 --> 00:14:26.550\nif they lock the screen,\nthat's it, it's locked.\n\n326\n00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:31.030\nBut if I go down here to login options and\nlook at the login options.\n\n327\n00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:34.540\nYou got a few choices in here and the one\nI'm looking for is this guy right here.\n\n328\n00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:39.650\nShow fast user switching menu as and\nit's defaulting to full name.\n\n329\n00:14:39.650 --> 00:14:41.650\nWhat's the fast user switching menu?\n\n330\n00:14:41.650 --> 00:14:43.670\nWell, if you've only got\none user it's nothing.\n\n331\n00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:45.250\nThe menu doesn't show up.\n\n332\n00:14:45.250 --> 00:14:49.830\nBut the instant you have two or more\nusers, this magical menu will show up.\n\n333\n00:14:49.830 --> 00:14:53.240\nAnd the magical menu is\nright up here in my bar.\n\n334\n00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:56.100\nJust a moment ago we had the time\n\n335\n00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:59.090\nfollowed by the spotlight followed\nby the notification button.\n\n336\n00:14:59.090 --> 00:15:01.270\nNow my name is in the menu.\n\n337\n00:15:01.270 --> 00:15:02.310\nWhy is that?\n\n338\n00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:05.395\nWell, it's there because\nnow I can fast user switch.\n\n339\n00:15:05.395 --> 00:15:08.410\nI'm login as me and see how I've\ngot my system preference open.\n\n340\n00:15:08.410 --> 00:15:12.530\nMaybe I open photos, I start doing\nwhatever it is that I'm doing, right?\n\n341\n00:15:12.530 --> 00:15:14.740\nAnd then I say,\nI know Daniel runs and says, hey Don.\n\n342\n00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:15.930\nCan I use the computer real quick.\n\n343\n00:15:15.930 --> 00:15:19.620\nAnd I'm like, crap, I've got all these\nprograms open, I don't want to close them.\n\n344\n00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:24.450\nBut I don't want Daniel to use my stuff,\nlet me just lock my screen and\n\n345\n00:15:24.450 --> 00:15:25.750\nturn it over to him.\n\n346\n00:15:25.750 --> 00:15:28.400\nSo I can hit my name up here.\n\n347\n00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:32.630\nAnd when I drop that down,\nsee how I can choose Daniel.\n\n348\n00:15:32.630 --> 00:15:34.050\nAnd I can pick him and\n\n349\n00:15:34.050 --> 00:15:40.300\nwhat it's gonna do is it's gonna lock\nmy access and open it up for Daniel.\n\n350\n00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:46.430\nAnd so now he can log in and he's able to\nlog in and use the computer as himself.\n\n351\n00:15:46.430 --> 00:15:50.158\nMy stuff is still running in\nthe background, but he can't mess with it.\n\n352\n00:15:50.158 --> 00:15:52.240\nNow that's not 100% true\ncuz I made him an admin and\n\n353\n00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:54.014\nas an admin he can mess\nwith all sorts of stuff.\n\n354\n00:15:54.014 --> 00:15:58.170\nBut if he's a regular user,\nhe can't mess with my data.\n\n355\n00:15:58.170 --> 00:16:03.210\nSo if we get him to finish logging in\nIf he fires up the activity monitor,\n\n356\n00:16:03.210 --> 00:16:07.242\nhe'll see my program still\nrunning in the background but\n\n357\n00:16:07.242 --> 00:16:09.930\nhe would have to know to look for that.\n\n358\n00:16:09.930 --> 00:16:11.230\nA regular user isn't gonna do that.\n\n359\n00:16:11.230 --> 00:16:14.660\nSee he just sees the regular desktop,\nhe gets to work doing his stuff.\n\n360\n00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:18.330\nMaybe he gets squirrely one day and\nfires up the activity monitor and\n\n361\n00:16:18.330 --> 00:16:20.310\nit starts to take a look at the processes.\n\n362\n00:16:20.310 --> 00:16:23.800\nAnd when we look at the processes, see\nthe user for all of this stuff, dlowrle,\n\n363\n00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:28.380\ndlowrle that's all him, but\nif he keeps browsing around,\n\n364\n00:16:28.380 --> 00:16:34.480\nwell all he says is dlowrle,\nall that is just his own processes.\n\n365\n00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:37.090\nBut I know is I've got\nprocesses back there too, and\n\n366\n00:16:37.090 --> 00:16:41.490\nthe difference is he's just seeing what's\nin his user because of fast user switched.\n\n367\n00:16:41.490 --> 00:16:46.010\nHe's not seeing all the other stuff\nthat's being run by the other users.\n\n368\n00:16:46.010 --> 00:16:48.270\nBut now I can flip back and\nforth between these users and\n\n369\n00:16:48.270 --> 00:16:50.150\nits not locked to a single person.\n\n370\n00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:53.730\nIf Daniel's about to walk away, he can\ngo up here and hit that Daniel menu.\n\n371\n00:16:53.730 --> 00:16:56.240\nAnd, he can switch it back\nto me if I'm there or\n\n372\n00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:58.920\nif he's just gonna walk away he\ncan just choose login window.\n\n373\n00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:04.250\nAnd when he does that it\neffectively locks the screen but\n\n374\n00:17:04.250 --> 00:17:06.710\nit also makes it where\nI can login if I want.\n\n375\n00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:09.110\nIt's not just locked and\nno one else can get into it.\n\n376\n00:17:09.110 --> 00:17:11.500\nIt's now locked and\neither one of us can get in, right?\n\n377\n00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:15.200\nAnd I can come in here and\nI can pick the my account and\n\n378\n00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:18.950\nI can login and again,\nI'm separate from Daniel.\n\n379\n00:17:18.950 --> 00:17:20.750\nHere's photos still running for me.\n\n380\n00:17:20.750 --> 00:17:22.630\nAnd my system preferences\nare open in the background,\n\n381\n00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:24.200\neverything's back the way that I wanted.\n\n382\n00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:25.850\nI'm now logged in as two people at once.\n\n383\n00:17:25.850 --> 00:17:29.850\nSo on a shared computer,\ninstead of locking your screen,\n\n384\n00:17:29.850 --> 00:17:32.830\njust hit your name and\nreturn back to that login window.\n\n385\n00:17:32.830 --> 00:17:35.420\nGoing back to the login window means\nthat it's still gonna be available for\n\n386\n00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:36.400\nyour other users.\n\n387\n00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:38.520\n>> Well,\nobviously that's pretty cool stuff, right?\n\n388\n00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:41.720\nI can have actual multiple\nusers on the system.\n\n389\n00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:45.440\nEverybody saying separate and\nplaying nicely using their own resources,\n\n390\n00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:49.420\ntheir own stuff, without intruding\non the other user's system and\n\n391\n00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:51.520\nthings that they have set up for\nthemselves.\n\n392\n00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:54.070\nBut that's not always the case.\n\n393\n00:17:54.070 --> 00:17:56.460\nA lot of times we get computers and\n\n394\n00:17:56.460 --> 00:17:59.380\nusually this is how they\ncome out of the gate, right?\n\n395\n00:17:59.380 --> 00:18:02.170\nWe buy a computer, buy Mac,\nbuy whatever it is.\n\n396\n00:18:02.170 --> 00:18:04.830\nYou take it home,\nyou put it up and what does it do?\n\n397\n00:18:04.830 --> 00:18:06.410\nIt just logs you right in.\n\n398\n00:18:06.410 --> 00:18:09.670\nAnd that's the way you want it, because\nmaybe you've got everybody in the family's\n\n399\n00:18:09.670 --> 00:18:11.550\nusing the same, kinda like that scenario.\n\n400\n00:18:11.550 --> 00:18:12.420\nAnd who cares, right?\n\n401\n00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:13.900\nIt's just no big deal.\n\n402\n00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:16.275\nBut the fact that this is set\nup by default, right Don?\n\n403\n00:18:16.275 --> 00:18:18.140\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> That's the security flaw.\n\n404\n00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:20.950\n>> Yeah, what Daniel's talking\nabout is called automatic logon.\n\n405\n00:18:20.950 --> 00:18:25.080\nAnd if you've only got one user account,\nit's really tempting to set this up.\n\n406\n00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:28.720\nIf it's a laptop and you're the only user\nof it, you can set it to auto log on, so\n\n407\n00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:32.240\nwhen you power it on, it just goes\nstraight to your Mac OS desktop.\n\n408\n00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:32.760\nIt's convenient.\n\n409\n00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:34.910\nI didn't have to type the password,\nthat was nice.\n\n410\n00:18:34.910 --> 00:18:38.228\nBut, you know what, whoever steals your\nlaptop doesn't have to type the password.\n\n411\n00:18:38.228 --> 00:18:41.550\nSo, if somebody steals your laptop or\nsteals your desktop, they take it home,\n\n412\n00:18:41.550 --> 00:18:44.960\nthey plug it in and\nit automatically logs in for them.\n\n413\n00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:47.610\nWell you shut your computer off at\nthe end of the day and you go home, and\n\n414\n00:18:47.610 --> 00:18:50.580\nthe janitor walks up and\npresses that power button, and pow,\n\n415\n00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:52.590\nthey're in, they're on your computer.\n\n416\n00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:57.030\nSo automatic log in, it's okay for home\nusers, but for business users, people who\n\n417\n00:18:57.030 --> 00:19:00.400\nhave sensitive data on their computer,\nyou do not want automatic log in.\n\n418\n00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:02.860\nSo if you've turned it on,\nyou'll wanna turn it off.\n\n419\n00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:03.940\nAll right now how do we check?\n\n420\n00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:05.650\nThat's another thing in\nour system preferences.\n\n421\n00:19:05.650 --> 00:19:06.640\nIf I look at users and\n\n422\n00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:10.550\ngroups where I was a moment ago,\nI can go here into my login options right?\n\n423\n00:19:10.550 --> 00:19:13.380\nHere's my list of users and\nI've chosen login options.\n\n424\n00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:15.580\nIt's right here, automatic login.\n\n425\n00:19:15.580 --> 00:19:17.330\nMine's currently turned off.\n\n426\n00:19:17.330 --> 00:19:21.010\nI can turn it on and I can pick the user\nI want to automatically login so\n\n427\n00:19:21.010 --> 00:19:22.330\nI'll choose Don Pezet.\n\n428\n00:19:22.330 --> 00:19:23.070\nRight.\n\n429\n00:19:23.070 --> 00:19:25.050\nAnd it's gonna have me\ntype in my password.\n\n430\n00:19:25.050 --> 00:19:25.635\nNow, why?\n\n431\n00:19:25.635 --> 00:19:28.100\nCuz it's about to save my password.\n\n432\n00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:29.380\nIt's gonna save it, so\n\n433\n00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:33.890\nthat when the computer boots up, it can\njust put that password in for me, and now,\n\n434\n00:19:33.890 --> 00:19:38.500\nwhenever we power on,\nit'll automatically log in as me.\n\n435\n00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:41.200\nAnd so, if I were to go and\nreboot this computer.\n\n436\n00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:42.490\nSo I'm just gonna restart.\n\n437\n00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:45.410\nWhen it reboots.\n\n438\n00:19:45.410 --> 00:19:48.600\nIt's just warning me that\nother users are logged in and\n\n439\n00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:51.280\nit's gonna kick them out and\nI'm okay with that.\n\n440\n00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:55.680\nBut it's saying here that if we want to\nsave the other people's stuff then I need\n\n441\n00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:57.750\nto provide their credentials.\n\n442\n00:19:57.750 --> 00:19:59.470\nI really don't care about your account,\nDaniel.\n\n443\n00:19:59.470 --> 00:20:01.850\nSo, I'm just gonna force the restart.\n\n444\n00:20:01.850 --> 00:20:02.530\nThere we go.\n\n445\n00:20:02.530 --> 00:20:04.190\nSo it's gonna restart.\n\n446\n00:20:04.190 --> 00:20:07.350\nNow, when it reboots it's gonna\nsee that automatic login setting,\n\n447\n00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:09.730\nand it's gonna log in as Don Pezet.\n\n448\n00:20:09.730 --> 00:20:13.010\nIt's gonna put those in and\njust walk right into the operating system.\n\n449\n00:20:13.010 --> 00:20:16.580\nSo whoever sits down at this\ncomputer can quickly get in as me,\n\n450\n00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:18.630\nand now they've got access to my stuff.\n\n451\n00:20:18.630 --> 00:20:20.110\nThat's bad news.\n\n452\n00:20:20.110 --> 00:20:21.490\nSo make sure you turn that off.\n\n453\n00:20:21.490 --> 00:20:25.970\nIt was off by default on mine but\non yours, when you initially set it up,\n\n454\n00:20:25.970 --> 00:20:27.500\nyou may have chose it turn it on.\n\n455\n00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:28.660\nAnd see me, I wanna turn that on.\n\n456\n00:20:28.660 --> 00:20:29.620\n>> Yeah.\nAnd like you said,\n\n457\n00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:34.540\nit is super temptation to enable that\nbecause it is very very convenience.\n\n458\n00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:37.290\nBut obviously we've seen\nthe dangers of that.\n\n459\n00:20:37.290 --> 00:20:39.190\nI've always heard the analogy of,\n\n460\n00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:43.920\nyou'll think about security and\nusability as a scale, right.\n\n461\n00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:46.860\nYou got security on one side,\nand usability on the other.\n\n462\n00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:48.540\nYou move the one,\nthe other goes down, right?\n\n463\n00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:51.030\nSo it becomes super secure,\nit becomes very difficult to use,\n\n464\n00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:53.890\nit becomes very easy to use,\nit becomes very unsecure.\n\n465\n00:20:53.890 --> 00:20:56.440\nSo, you gotta try to\nfind that happy medium.\n\n466\n00:20:56.440 --> 00:21:00.090\nDefinitely, definitely wanna\ndisable this automatic log in\n\n467\n00:21:00.090 --> 00:21:02.040\nin any kind of secure environments.\n\n468\n00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:04.530\nThat being said,\nnow that we have your computer back up.\n\n469\n00:21:04.530 --> 00:21:06.020\n>> Yes.\n>> I was rambling perfectly.\n\n470\n00:21:06.020 --> 00:21:06.935\n>> Good timing.\n\n471\n00:21:06.935 --> 00:21:08.870\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So yeah, so\n\n472\n00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:11.710\nright here auto login, I didn't have to\nprovide a password, I went straight in,\n\n473\n00:21:11.710 --> 00:21:13.240\nnow it's at my desktop and\nthat's a problem.\n\n474\n00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:15.380\nAnd my biggest fear on this is again,\n\n475\n00:21:15.380 --> 00:21:18.380\npeople walking up behind us after\nwe've left, but also theft.\n\n476\n00:21:18.380 --> 00:21:21.560\nIf somebody steals my laptop,\nthey don't even have to have a password,\n\n477\n00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:23.310\nthey just power it on and\nthey get the data.\n\n478\n00:21:23.310 --> 00:21:24.030\nAll right.\nAnd\n\n479\n00:21:24.030 --> 00:21:25.970\nlet's continue on with that idea of theft,\nright.\n\n480\n00:21:25.970 --> 00:21:27.990\nLet's say that I go the extra mile, and\n\n481\n00:21:27.990 --> 00:21:31.190\nI go into system preferences and\nI turn off automatic login.\n\n482\n00:21:31.190 --> 00:21:33.330\nI know that's a problem,\nI don't want it there.\n\n483\n00:21:33.330 --> 00:21:35.820\nAnd so I get in here and\nI'm gonna turn that off.\n\n484\n00:21:35.820 --> 00:21:39.870\nAnd I'm gonna get rid of Daniel's account\ntoo, I'm gonna go back to just my account.\n\n485\n00:21:39.870 --> 00:21:41.520\nI don't wanna have multiple accounts.\n\n486\n00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:43.350\nSo I'll turn that off.\n\n487\n00:21:43.350 --> 00:21:46.060\nI'm gonna get rid of Daniel where\nit's gonna wreak all sorts of havoc.\n\n488\n00:21:47.170 --> 00:21:50.710\nWe'll delete his home folder,\n[INAUDIBLE] we'll just get rid of that.\n\n489\n00:21:50.710 --> 00:21:51.490\nThere we go.\n\n490\n00:21:51.490 --> 00:21:54.980\nSo, I've got my own user account,\nI'm not doing auto login.\n\n491\n00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:58.900\nI've got my screen saver and stuff set\nto lock the system pretty quickly and\n\n492\n00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:01.430\nI can always lock it myself\nwhen I'm done using it.\n\n493\n00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:04.370\nSo, that's easy and I'm protected.\n\n494\n00:22:04.370 --> 00:22:07.090\nIf somebody steals this computer and\ntakes it home and powers it on,\n\n495\n00:22:07.090 --> 00:22:09.770\nthey're gonna see a user prompt right?\n\n496\n00:22:09.770 --> 00:22:10.490\nLogin and password,\n\n497\n00:22:10.490 --> 00:22:12.840\nthey gotta provide that information\nto get in and work with the system.\n\n498\n00:22:14.050 --> 00:22:15.540\nOr do they?\n\n499\n00:22:15.540 --> 00:22:17.960\nIf you watched the Mac\nmanagement basics episodes,\n\n500\n00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:21.930\nI showed in that series how you\ncan boot a Mac into target mode.\n\n501\n00:22:21.930 --> 00:22:24.390\nWhen you push the power button,\nyou hold T on the keyboard and\n\n502\n00:22:24.390 --> 00:22:25.220\nit boots in target mode.\n\n503\n00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:29.260\nAnd at that point you can run\na thunderbolt cable from your laptop to\n\n504\n00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:33.290\na desktop or another Mac, and\nyour Mac shows up as a hard drive.\n\n505\n00:22:33.290 --> 00:22:33.790\nRight.\n\n506\n00:22:33.790 --> 00:22:37.390\nSo, let's say Daniel steals my laptop,\nboots in in target mode, he could hook it\n\n507\n00:22:37.390 --> 00:22:41.280\nup to his laptop and then, he can browse\nmy hard drive to his hards content and\n\n508\n00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:46.430\naccess all of my data because he never\nactually booted the operating system so,\n\n509\n00:22:46.430 --> 00:22:50.500\nit never hit a place where it has for\nusing a password, it's just a hard drive.\n\n510\n00:22:51.530 --> 00:22:52.180\nEven if he didn't.\n\n511\n00:22:52.180 --> 00:22:55.850\nLet's say Daniel wanted my data and\nhe didn't have a thunder bolt cable handy.\n\n512\n00:22:55.850 --> 00:22:57.640\nHe can boot into recovery mode.\n\n513\n00:22:57.640 --> 00:23:01.250\nBoot into recovery mode hold command R\nwhile you boot you boot into recovery mode\n\n514\n00:23:01.250 --> 00:23:03.150\ndrop to a terminal, and\nguess what you see?\n\n515\n00:23:03.150 --> 00:23:07.980\nThe whole stinking hard drive and\nall the data inside it's all right there.\n\n516\n00:23:07.980 --> 00:23:10.800\nThe world is your oyster,\nyou have at it, right?\n\n517\n00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:14.650\nSo just having a password is not enough.\n\n518\n00:23:14.650 --> 00:23:19.186\nWe have to do something to ensure that\nif somebody wants to look at my data,\n\n519\n00:23:19.186 --> 00:23:23.588\nthey've got to enter the password,\nthat there's no way to bypass it.\n\n520\n00:23:23.588 --> 00:23:27.212\nWe've gotta make sure that target mode and\nrecovery mode and\n\n521\n00:23:27.212 --> 00:23:29.068\nall those guys are secure too.\n\n522\n00:23:29.068 --> 00:23:31.060\nAnd it's really hard to do.\n\n523\n00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:31.940\nBack in the early days,\n\n524\n00:23:31.940 --> 00:23:34.760\nApple started releasing this\ntechnology called FileVault.\n\n525\n00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:38.460\nAnd what FileVault would do was it\nwould take your profile directory, so\n\n526\n00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:42.000\njust the profile directory for your\nuser account, and it would encrypt it.\n\n527\n00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.180\nThe whole rest of the hard\ndrive is unencrypted,\n\n528\n00:23:44.180 --> 00:23:47.060\njust your profile is encrypted,\nand it worked okay, right?\n\n529\n00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:49.019\nIt wasn't the greatest,\nit just worked okay.\n\n530\n00:23:49.019 --> 00:23:52.121\nWell, in newer versions of Mac OS really,\nI think,\n\n531\n00:23:52.121 --> 00:23:57.140\nthey introduced it in 10.7 if I remember\nright, they introduced FileVault 2.\n\n532\n00:23:57.140 --> 00:24:02.829\nAnd what FileVault 2 does is it\nencrypts your entire hard drive.\n\n533\n00:24:02.829 --> 00:24:05.469\nSo now if somebody wants to\nboot into target mode, or\n\n534\n00:24:05.469 --> 00:24:08.599\nif somebody wants to boot into\nrecovery mode, that's fine.\n\n535\n00:24:08.599 --> 00:24:10.830\nBut, they're just going to\nsee an encrypted hard drive.\n\n536\n00:24:10.830 --> 00:24:12.740\nAnd how do you decrypt it?\n\n537\n00:24:12.740 --> 00:24:14.460\nThey gotta have your username and\npassword.\n\n538\n00:24:14.460 --> 00:24:17.450\nThey've gotta have the password to be able\nto get at the key to decrypt the drive.\n\n539\n00:24:17.450 --> 00:24:19.700\nAnd if they don't have\nthat they can't do it,\n\n540\n00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:22.830\nthey can't decrypt the drive,\nit's encrypted that's it.\n\n541\n00:24:22.830 --> 00:24:27.400\nSo FileVault, the FileVault 2 in\nparticular, not the original FileVault,\n\n542\n00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:32.860\nFileVault 2 will encrypt your\nentire drive and coupled with\n\n543\n00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:37.380\na lock screen will ensure that if somebody\nsteals your computer, your data is safe.\n\n544\n00:24:37.380 --> 00:24:39.470\nIf somebody steals my laptop and\n\n545\n00:24:39.470 --> 00:24:42.750\nthey boot into recovery or\ntarget mode, I'm not worried.\n\n546\n00:24:42.750 --> 00:24:44.950\nIf they try and logon with my username and\n\n547\n00:24:44.950 --> 00:24:47.300\npassword, they don't know my password,\nI'm not worried.\n\n548\n00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:51.290\nEventually they might be able to guess\nthat password and that becomes a problem.\n\n549\n00:24:51.290 --> 00:24:55.770\nWell, we've got technologies like Apple\nProfile Manager where you can remote wipe\n\n550\n00:24:55.770 --> 00:24:57.750\nthe machines and so on,\nthat can help with that.\n\n551\n00:24:57.750 --> 00:25:03.030\nBut otherwise we have\na fairly secure system.\n\n552\n00:25:03.030 --> 00:25:05.930\nSo let's say that we wanna enable\nFileVault it's actually pretty easy to do.\n\n553\n00:25:05.930 --> 00:25:06.920\nLet me show you.\n\n554\n00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:09.450\nSo on this Mac I'm not\nusing FileVault right now.\n\n555\n00:25:09.450 --> 00:25:14.170\nIf I go into my system preferences and\nI go to the security and\n\n556\n00:25:14.170 --> 00:25:20.090\nprivacy app when I go into that preference\nscreen, I came in the screen earlier,\n\n557\n00:25:20.090 --> 00:25:22.720\ncuz that's where I was requiring a\npassword immediately when the screen went\n\n558\n00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:26.280\nto sleep but, you'll see I've\nalso got a FileVault tab and\n\n559\n00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:30.038\nif I choose FileVault, here's where\nwe can encrypt the entire disk.\n\n560\n00:25:30.038 --> 00:25:32.860\nAnd see where it says,\nFileVault secures the data on your disk\n\n561\n00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:37.330\nby encrypting it's contents automatically,\nit will encrypt the entire harddrive,\n\n562\n00:25:37.330 --> 00:25:41.150\nyour user profile, everybody\nelse's profile, the system folder,\n\n563\n00:25:41.150 --> 00:25:45.390\nthe preferences, the library folder,\nall that stuff, it all gets encrypted.\n\n564\n00:25:45.390 --> 00:25:46.520\nRight now, it's turned off.\n\n565\n00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:47.472\nNow, it does give you a warning.\n\n566\n00:25:47.472 --> 00:25:50.700\nHey, when we encrypt this,\nwe're gonna give you a key, and\n\n567\n00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:53.340\nif you lose that key, nobody else has it.\n\n568\n00:25:53.340 --> 00:25:55.680\nYou're the only one that has the key,\nit's up to you, so\n\n569\n00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:59.560\nif you lose that, you might have\nsome problems later in life.\n\n570\n00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:01.780\nSo we want to make sure\nthat we keep that safe, but\n\n571\n00:26:01.780 --> 00:26:03.540\nwe'll get that recovery key in a minute.\n\n572\n00:26:03.540 --> 00:26:05.900\nIf I want to turn this on I do\nneed to unlock the screen first,\n\n573\n00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:08.670\nit's locked on me, there we go.\n\n574\n00:26:08.670 --> 00:26:12.080\nAnd now I've got that turn on FileVault\noption, and I'm gonna turn that on.\n\n575\n00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:15.600\nAnd when I do it, it's gonna ask\nme how I want to do my recovery.\n\n576\n00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:19.710\nThe recovery key can just be\nan independent recovery key\n\n577\n00:26:19.710 --> 00:26:24.430\nthat it gives me right here on this screen\nthat I can save to a file or whatever.\n\n578\n00:26:24.430 --> 00:26:26.150\nI need to be careful with that.\n\n579\n00:26:26.150 --> 00:26:30.360\nLet's say I save it to a file and\nI leave it on a USB key on my desk.\n\n580\n00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:32.720\nWhat happens if somebody\ngets that USB key?\n\n581\n00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:37.530\nThey can now decrypt all my data, so\nthe recover key file is really important,\n\n582\n00:26:37.530 --> 00:26:38.970\nI need to keep it safe.\n\n583\n00:26:38.970 --> 00:26:42.660\nThey offer to keep it safe for me,\nwe can store it in our iCloud account.\n\n584\n00:26:42.660 --> 00:26:44.640\nSo you can pop it right\nup there in iCloud and\n\n585\n00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:47.192\nit'll tie it to your Apple ID and\nit's stored up there.\n\n586\n00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:50.105\nThat's cool, because now you don't\nhave to worry about backing up\n\n587\n00:26:50.105 --> 00:26:51.740\nthe recovery key, it's up there.\n\n588\n00:26:51.740 --> 00:26:55.140\nIt's not so cool, because Apple can be\nsubpoenaed and have to turn it over.\n\n589\n00:26:55.140 --> 00:26:58.030\nSo if you're a US citizen,\nit doesn't matter much,\n\n590\n00:26:58.030 --> 00:27:02.360\nbut if you're outside of the US, you're\neffectively having your keys stored in\n\n591\n00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:04.320\na place where the US\ngovernment can get at it.\n\n592\n00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:08.170\nSo you have to make that decision, get the\nsafety and security of a backed up key,\n\n593\n00:27:08.170 --> 00:27:11.400\nwith the tradeoff of US\ngovernment scrutiny.\n\n594\n00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:15.010\nIf you're a U.S. citizen though it's fine,\nit's really not a big deal cuz\n\n595\n00:27:15.010 --> 00:27:18.606\nthey're gonna get it one way or another,\n[LAUGH] is the way to look at that.\n\n596\n00:27:18.606 --> 00:27:19.693\n>> See you in the FISA court.\n\n597\n00:27:19.693 --> 00:27:21.980\n[LAUGH]\n>> I know, I know, but\n\n598\n00:27:21.980 --> 00:27:25.820\nif you really want to be safe you\nchoose to store the key yourself, and\n\n599\n00:27:25.820 --> 00:27:29.630\nyou put it on a USB key or burn it to\na CD and stick it in a vault somewhere.\n\n600\n00:27:29.630 --> 00:27:32.780\nAnd by vault I mean an actual safe not\nlike you know some software vault.\n\n601\n00:27:32.780 --> 00:27:35.280\nSo put it somewhere secure\nwhere you can get it at.\n\n602\n00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:36.960\nBecause if you every forget\nyour own password and\n\n603\n00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:40.510\nget locked out, this key is the only\nthing that's gonna let you get back in.\n\n604\n00:27:40.510 --> 00:27:43.830\nIf you call Apple tech support, they're\ngonna tell you to format your hard drive.\n\n605\n00:27:43.830 --> 00:27:47.430\nThe data's gone, sorry, they don't have a\nway to decrypt the data without this key.\n\n606\n00:27:48.650 --> 00:27:52.440\nSo I'm gonna choose the recovery\nkey option just to store it myself.\n\n607\n00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:53.390\nAnd here's my key.\n\n608\n00:27:53.390 --> 00:27:57.220\nSo they give you the key, and\nnotice there's no save button here.\n\n609\n00:27:57.220 --> 00:28:00.890\nThey want me to take this key and write\nit down and put it somewhere safe and\n\n610\n00:28:00.890 --> 00:28:04.710\nsecure, preferably not on my computer\nwhere someone else could get it or\n\n611\n00:28:04.710 --> 00:28:07.770\nI couldn't get it if I lose my encryption.\n\n612\n00:28:07.770 --> 00:28:12.190\nBut we can copy it, and then we can take\nit and paste it somewhere and save it.\n\n613\n00:28:12.190 --> 00:28:13.495\nBut if you don't write this down,\n\n614\n00:28:13.495 --> 00:28:16.750\nthat's the only way to recover your\nsystem if you forget your password.\n\n615\n00:28:16.750 --> 00:28:20.250\nNow, I know my password and\nI got a mind like a steel trap,\n\n616\n00:28:20.250 --> 00:28:22.810\nso I'm not worried about it,\nI'm not gonna write this down.\n\n617\n00:28:22.810 --> 00:28:24.560\nDon't do that, it's a big mistake.\n\n618\n00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:28.000\nBecause anything goes wrong with your\npassword, and now you're locked out,\n\n619\n00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:28.520\nyour data's gone.\n\n620\n00:28:30.430 --> 00:28:32.670\nSo now it's gonna ask me to restart.\n\n621\n00:28:32.670 --> 00:28:34.050\nWhy is it restarting?\n\n622\n00:28:34.050 --> 00:28:36.710\nWell, it's gonna encrypt\nthe entire hard drive,\n\n623\n00:28:36.710 --> 00:28:40.250\nincluding the places where\nthe operating system sits.\n\n624\n00:28:40.250 --> 00:28:43.360\nCan I encrypt the operating system while\nall the operating system is running?\n\n625\n00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:48.020\nNo, so it needs to restart so it can\nencrypt the area underneath the kernel.\n\n626\n00:28:48.020 --> 00:28:50.540\nAnd once that's done,\nit can then boot up the rest of the way,\n\n627\n00:28:50.540 --> 00:28:54.250\nand then it can encrypt the of\nthe system while it's online.\n\n628\n00:28:54.250 --> 00:28:56.880\nSo I'm gonna hit restart,\n[COUGH] and it's gonna restart and\n\n629\n00:28:56.880 --> 00:28:58.860\nkick into the encryption process.\n\n630\n00:28:58.860 --> 00:29:03.602\nAnd the first part is kind of exclusive,\nit has to do it, it has to encrypt\n\n631\n00:29:03.602 --> 00:29:07.380\nthe area where the kernel and some of the\nkey operating system files are, but once\n\n632\n00:29:07.380 --> 00:29:10.970\nit's done it'll boot up the rest of the\nway and I can actually keep using the Mac.\n\n633\n00:29:10.970 --> 00:29:14.670\nI can browse the web, check my email and\nit's encrypting the hard drive.\n\n634\n00:29:14.670 --> 00:29:17.370\nNow the whole hard drive\nis not encrypted yet.\n\n635\n00:29:17.370 --> 00:29:19.810\nIt can take hours for\nthe hard drive to encrypt.\n\n636\n00:29:19.810 --> 00:29:23.120\nSo what I normally recommend\nis just turn this on\n\n637\n00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:27.490\nat the end of the day when you're about\nto go home, turn it on and head home.\n\n638\n00:29:27.490 --> 00:29:31.250\nLet it encrypt overnight and by the time\nyou come in in the morning it's done and\n\n639\n00:29:31.250 --> 00:29:32.620\n100% of your drive is encrypted.\n\n640\n00:29:32.620 --> 00:29:38.160\nBut if you start using it while\nit's encrypting, your data isn't\n\n641\n00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:42.550\nsafe until the encryption is complete so\nyou don't necessarily know that it's done.\n\n642\n00:29:42.550 --> 00:29:44.040\nIt'll tell you when it's done.\n\n643\n00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:46.300\nBut you don't necessarily know what\nareas of the driver encrypted and\n\n644\n00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:47.370\nwhat areas are.\n\n645\n00:29:47.370 --> 00:29:47.989\nSo here.\nSo here it goes,\n\n646\n00:29:47.989 --> 00:29:49.420\nsee this little white bar at the bottom?\n\n647\n00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:51.490\nIt's going, and\nnotice how my screen is four by three.\n\n648\n00:29:51.490 --> 00:29:53.760\nI've got these black bars\non the side of my screen.\n\n649\n00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:55.840\nI'm not actually running MacOS right now.\n\n650\n00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:57.320\nI'm really running the recovery console,\n\n651\n00:29:57.320 --> 00:30:00.680\nthe really small OS it\nloads to decrypt the drive.\n\n652\n00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:02.900\nAnd it's encrypting that\nkernel area right now.\n\n653\n00:30:02.900 --> 00:30:07.050\nAnd as soon as it's done, then it's\ngonna boot to the operating system.\n\n654\n00:30:07.050 --> 00:30:07.840\nThere it goes.\n\n655\n00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:12.470\nAnd now my black bars are gone, I'm back\nto a nice 16 by 9 screen, and I'm in here.\n\n656\n00:30:12.470 --> 00:30:15.280\nBut it's still encrypting.\n\n657\n00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:17.850\nIt encrypted a little bit,\nbut it's got a little more.\n\n658\n00:30:17.850 --> 00:30:18.990\nThis is a base install.\n\n659\n00:30:18.990 --> 00:30:22.440\nI think I'm using probably about\nten gigs of hard drive space, so\n\n660\n00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:23.960\nI've only got nine minutes remaining.\n\n661\n00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:26.770\nBut if you're on a laptop\nwith 500 gigs of storage or\n\n662\n00:30:26.770 --> 00:30:30.150\na desktop with a terabyte,\nthis could take hours.\n\n663\n00:30:30.150 --> 00:30:32.760\nThe more data you have,\nthe longer it takes to encrypt.\n\n664\n00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:36.070\nThis one's going churn along,\nthree minutes remaining now.\n\n665\n00:30:36.070 --> 00:30:38.590\nBut when it's done,\nthe entire hard drive is encrypted.\n\n666\n00:30:38.590 --> 00:30:41.040\nI can use it right now,\nso I can fire up Safari,\n\n667\n00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:43.660\nlet's head on out,\nsee what's new in the world.\n\n668\n00:30:43.660 --> 00:30:46.610\nSo I can use the computer like\nnormal it will be a bit slower cuz\n\n669\n00:30:46.610 --> 00:30:48.910\nthere's a lot of disk IO\ngoing on right now but\n\n670\n00:30:48.910 --> 00:30:52.330\nwe can browse around,\ndo all the things that we normally do.\n\n671\n00:30:52.330 --> 00:30:55.800\nAnd when it's done,\nit'll let us know and off we go.\n\n672\n00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:57.220\nWe're now nice and encrypted.\n\n673\n00:30:57.220 --> 00:31:00.955\nIf somebody steals this computer,\nthey can power it on and\n\n674\n00:31:00.955 --> 00:31:03.020\nthey'll get to a login screen,\nthey have to know my password.\n\n675\n00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:07.100\nIf they don't know my password,\nthey can boot to recovery and\n\n676\n00:31:07.100 --> 00:31:09.010\nit's gonna ask them for my password.\n\n677\n00:31:09.010 --> 00:31:11.627\nIf they know that, they can boot to\ntarget mode and it's gonna ask for\n\n678\n00:31:11.627 --> 00:31:13.590\nmy password and if they don't provide it,\n\n679\n00:31:13.590 --> 00:31:16.980\nin target mode and recovery mode it\njust doesn't see the hard drive.\n\n680\n00:31:16.980 --> 00:31:19.860\nYou can't get at the data,\nthere is actually a way they can force it\n\n681\n00:31:19.860 --> 00:31:22.420\nto erase the drive but\nthat kind of works out in our favor.\n\n682\n00:31:22.420 --> 00:31:24.230\nThey couldn't get at our data.\n\n683\n00:31:24.230 --> 00:31:25.330\nThere's not a way for them to,\n\n684\n00:31:25.330 --> 00:31:30.370\neven if they rip the hard drive out of the\nMac and go and attach it to a Linux box.\n\n685\n00:31:30.370 --> 00:31:32.692\nIt's encrypted,\nthey can't get that data, it's safe.\n\n686\n00:31:32.692 --> 00:31:37.350\nSo, FileVault is really important,\nit is not on by default.\n\n687\n00:31:37.350 --> 00:31:39.160\nSo, it's a level of\nprotection you don't have.\n\n688\n00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:42.010\nYou can implement all the security\nthings we talk about in this show, and\n\n689\n00:31:42.010 --> 00:31:46.000\nif you're not using FileVault, you're\nstill susceptible to physical theft.\n\n690\n00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:47.120\nSomebody could steal your laptop and\n\n691\n00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:51.830\nget it your data, your password could be\n60 characters long, it doesn't matter.\n\n692\n00:31:51.830 --> 00:31:55.610\nBecause the drive is not encrypted right,\nit's really important.\n\n693\n00:31:55.610 --> 00:31:59.700\n>> Well, now that we know how to secure\nour data using that drive encryption,\n\n694\n00:31:59.700 --> 00:32:01.130\nwe should definitely go in it.\n\n695\n00:32:01.130 --> 00:32:03.950\nIf this is a business computer,\nyou gotta remember that the data on\n\n696\n00:32:03.950 --> 00:32:08.320\nthat computer is the most likely much more\nimportant than the actual device itself.\n\n697\n00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:11.840\nEven though these things can be expensive\nand it would be a financial loss it\n\n698\n00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:15.680\nwould be nowhere near if you had something\nlike, I don't know, business secrets or\n\n699\n00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:18.695\npractices that you guys,\nmaybe the new prototype for\n\n700\n00:32:18.695 --> 00:32:21.965\nwhatever object you guys are making for\nyour company.\n\n701\n00:32:21.965 --> 00:32:25.245\nThat will be far more valuable\nto someone that is stealing.\n\n702\n00:32:25.245 --> 00:32:28.955\nSo encrypting that data using FileVault 2,\nto that is definitely way to go.\n\n703\n00:32:28.955 --> 00:32:32.235\nMake sure you enable that because\nlike Don said, not on by default.\n\n704\n00:32:32.235 --> 00:32:35.415\nNow Don, that being said we've\ngot actually quite a few more\n\n705\n00:32:35.415 --> 00:32:38.365\nsecurity features, and\nthat's good, we got everything and\n\n706\n00:32:38.365 --> 00:32:43.620\nthe kitchen sink to throw again as\na defense against security breaches.\n\n707\n00:32:43.620 --> 00:32:45.290\nAnd we do want to make\nsure we get through those.\n\n708\n00:32:45.290 --> 00:32:47.930\nBut we are moving into\na part three on that.\n\n709\n00:32:47.930 --> 00:32:50.680\nSo that being said,\nthank you for stopping by.\n\n710\n00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:55.130\nThank you for explaining FileVault and how\nwe can secure our computers by locking it\n\n711\n00:32:55.130 --> 00:32:59.550\nor disabling automatic password and\nall the other things we showed you today.\n\n712\n00:32:59.550 --> 00:33:00.970\nBut I'll see you in part three.\n\n713\n00:33:00.970 --> 00:33:03.260\nHopefully we'll see you in part three,\nwe're going to go ahead and\n\n714\n00:33:03.260 --> 00:33:06.290\nsign off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lawry.\n\n715\n00:33:06.290 --> 00:33:07.173\n>> And I'm Don Piezet.\n\n716\n00:33:07.173 --> 00:33:08.810\n>> We'll see you next time.\n\n717\n00:33:08.810 -->

another great episode of\nITProTV, I'm your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n4\n00:00:18.141 --> 00:00:19.100\nAnd in today's episode,\n\n5\n00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.310\nwe are moving forward with our\nMac Integration Basic series.\n\n6\n00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.270\nSo he is back in the studio again today\nto be our guiding star with a part three.\n\n7\n00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:27.820\nYes, it is that long.\n\n8\n00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.820\nOn security is none other than\nour good friend, Mr Don Pezet.\n\n9\n00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:31.810\nDon, welcome back, sir.\n\n10\n00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:32.510\n>> What can I say?\n\n11\n00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:33.858\nI was born a rambling man, right?\n\n12\n00:00:33.858 --> 00:00:34.638\n>> Yes.\n\n13\n00:00:34.638 --> 00:00:35.840\n[LAUGH]\n>> So,\n\n14\n00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.840\nwe've talked about a lot\nof security concepts, and\n\n15\n00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.330\nwe're gonna talk about more\n[LAUGH] here in this episode.\n\n16\n00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:42.570\nBut I promise I'll try and\nkeep them a little more concise,\n\n17\n00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.560\ncuz the last ones are really\njust a couple of odds and ends.\n\n18\n00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:49.570\nThe last episode, if you watched part two,\nwe ended it by talking about FileVault.\n\n19\n00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.310\nAnd FileVault let us encrypt\nour entire hard drive so\n\n20\n00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:55.130\nif somebody stole our computer,\nthey could try and\n\n21\n00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:58.880\nbypass the operating system all they\nwanted but the data is still encrypted.\n\n22\n00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.232\nThey can get the data more safe.\n\n23\n00:01:01.232 --> 00:01:02.660\nSo, FileVault is a great thing,\n\n24\n00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.910\nwe definitely want that turned on,\nwe're protected.\n\n25\n00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:08.320\nBut there's one little problem,\nand this is a little problem.\n\n26\n00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:09.570\nIf you've got FileVault turned on, and\n\n27\n00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.100\nsomebody steals your laptop your\ndata is safe, don't get me wrong.\n\n28\n00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.820\nBut whoever stole your laptop, or\nwhoever stole your desktop, or\n\n29\n00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.950\nwhatever, they could just\nformat the hard drive.\n\n30\n00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.280\nThey look at it, go it's encrypted data,\nI can't get at it.\n\n31\n00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:23.270\nWell, forget that.\n\n32\n00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:24.540\nLet me just format it.\n\n33\n00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.990\nI'll re-install Mac OS cuz that's\npretty easy, use Internet Recovery.\n\n34\n00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.680\nAnd once it's re-installed,\nthey just sell it on eBay.\n\n35\n00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.810\nHey I can't get at your data but\nI can sell your laptop for $200.\n\n36\n00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.220\nSo that's what happens.\n\n37\n00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.650\nEven if you've got FileVault turned on.\n\n38\n00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.920\nIt doesn't stop somebody from\njust formatting your computer.\n\n39\n00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.870\nGiving it all the quick wipe.\n\n40\n00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:44.780\nEven if it trying to stop it,\nthey can just rip the hard drive and\n\n41\n00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.370\nthrow it in trash.\n\n42\n00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:47.030\nPop a new hard drive.\n\n43\n00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:48.650\nYou can get a hard drive for 50 bucks.\n\n44\n00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:50.380\nPut it in there, and now off you go.\n\n45\n00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:51.210\nYou got a new mac.\n\n46\n00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.380\nYou can sell on eBay or\nwherever it is you wanna sell it.\n\n47\n00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.740\nSo, that's a problem with FileVault.\n\n48\n00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.120\nSo if we wanna make sure that\nif somebody steals our laptop,\n\n49\n00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.830\nthey can't even use the hardware,\nwe need to go one step further.\n\n50\n00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.780\nAnd boy, this will really tick somebody\noff when they steal your stuff and\n\n51\n00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.920\nthey'll just throw the whole thing away.\n\n52\n00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.450\nBut at least they can't use it and\nmake some money off it.\n\n53\n00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.660\nSo what we need to do is we need to\nenable what's called a firmware password.\n\n54\n00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:16.660\nNow Macs,\n\n55\n00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.890\nApple in general doesn't like to let\nyou into the firmware of their devices.\n\n56\n00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.930\nRight?\nThey don't let you get into the BIOS,\n\n57\n00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.270\nlike on a Windows or a PC type machine.\n\n58\n00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.320\nYou can't get into the BIOS\nunderlying this thing and\n\n59\n00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:28.290\nstart to mess around with it.\n\n60\n00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:29.860\nThey lock all that away.\n\n61\n00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.770\nBut a firmware password is the one\ntime where they expose a little bit of\n\n62\n00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:33.940\nthat functionality.\n\n63\n00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.040\nAnd basically what it does is, it puts\na password on the motherboard of your Mac.\n\n64\n00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.170\nAnd so, if somebody steals your laptop or\nsteals Mac mini, your Mac Pro, whatever,\n\n65\n00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.510\nthey find your data as encrypted,\nthey fill the hard drive in the trash,\n\n66\n00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.230\nthey put the drive in,\nthey still can't boot.\n\n67\n00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.160\nBecause when they go to boot,\nthe motherboard ask for\n\n68\n00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.040\nthat password, all right?\n\n69\n00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.170\nNow, pros and cons that, right?\n\n70\n00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:54.870\nOn a positive side,\n\n71\n00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.840\npeople are gonna be less likely just steal\nyour equipment cuz they can't reuse it.\n\n72\n00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:58.590\nRight?\n\n73\n00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.970\nOn a negative side,\nif you forget your firmware password,\n\n74\n00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.580\nthat's gonna be a little bit of\na problem for you too, right,\n\n75\n00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:06.260\nbecause you're now locked out of a device.\n\n76\n00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.500\nWell, fortunately this one's little bit\ndifferent than an encryption password.\n\n77\n00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.310\nIf you forget your encryption password,\n\n78\n00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:17.600\nif you forget your recovery key, Apple\ncannot help you recover from FileVault.\n\n79\n00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.290\nBut if you forget your firmware password,\nApple can.\n\n80\n00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.020\nBut you have to take\nthe device to an Apple store.\n\n81\n00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:25.370\nThey can't do it over the phone.\n\n82\n00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:26.400\nThey can't walk you through it.\n\n83\n00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.220\nYou actually have to take your\ndevice to an Apple store and\n\n84\n00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.210\nthey'll reset that password for you.\n\n85\n00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:34.860\nNow, why make you take it into the store?\n\n86\n00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:36.980\nWell, the answer's simple,\nwhen you go into the store\n\n87\n00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.230\nthey run the serial number of that\nunit and make sure you own it.\n\n88\n00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.720\nAnd if you don't own it they\nwill not reset it for you.\n\n89\n00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.000\nSo if you stole the laptop,\nor you have it unlawfully,\n\n90\n00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.920\nyou won't be able to reset\nthat firmware password, right.\n\n91\n00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.900\nIt's a way for them to check whether\nyou should legally own it or not.\n\n92\n00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.220\nAnd if you don't own it, they can hold it.\n\n93\n00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.140\nThey can call the authorities and\nnow you can recover your equipment.\n\n94\n00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:58.680\nSo a firmware password is really nice.\n\n95\n00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.120\nEspecially on mobile devices.\n\n96\n00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:01.840\nDevices are easy to lose or have stolen,\n\n97\n00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.040\nthings like laptops,\nwe really want it there.\n\n98\n00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.671\nIf it's you Mac Pro that sits on\nyou desk at your office, day-in,\n\n99\n00:04:06.671 --> 00:04:10.210\nday-out in a locked office, you might\nnot worry about it so much there.\n\n100\n00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:13.210\nBut somebody could break in to your office\nand take it, it's very, very possible.\n\n101\n00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:15.380\nSo a firmware password helps, all right.\n\n102\n00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:18.090\nWell turning on a firmware password\nis a little bit challenging,\n\n103\n00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:22.120\nbecause you can't do it in the regular OS,\nyou have to boot to recovery.\n\n104\n00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.080\nAnd in recovery there's a special\nutility in there that lets us\n\n105\n00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:26.510\nturn on that firmware password.\n\n106\n00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:29.640\nSo I've got a little Mac\nmini sitting here with me.\n\n107\n00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:32.440\nAnd we're gonna turn on that firmware\npassword here on the Mac mini.\n\n108\n00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.941\nI'd do it on my laptop,\nbut I don't want to.\n\n109\n00:04:34.941 --> 00:04:39.540\n[LAUGH] So we're gonna do it on the Mac\nmini instead and get it set up here.\n\n110\n00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:42.000\nWhat I'm gonna do is start off\nright here on the Mac mini and\n\n111\n00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.090\nit's booted into Mac OS and\nI'm on the screen saver there.\n\n112\n00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:45.600\nRight, here we go.\nSo,\n\n113\n00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:49.190\nI'm running El Capitan but this is one of\nthose features where it really doesn't\n\n114\n00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:52.573\nmatter from running El Capitan or\nnot or I could be running or\n\n115\n00:04:52.573 --> 00:04:55.989\nwhatever cuz the former password\nis a part of your hardware, right.\n\n116\n00:04:55.989 --> 00:04:59.350\nOne thing I wanna mention, I just\nthought of this, older Mac's, right.\n\n117\n00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:02.900\nIf you start Googling around on\nthe Internet for how to reset the firmware\n\n118\n00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:06.930\npassword, you'll actually find some\narticles by people that are telling you.\n\n119\n00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:09.420\nHey, I know how to reset\nthat firmware password.\n\n120\n00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:13.350\nAll we did was open you're mac,\nand swap the memory sticks around.\n\n121\n00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:16.090\nIf you take the memory sticks in ports\none and two and swap them around,\n\n122\n00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:19.970\nthat will reset the firmware password,\nyou boot up and it's fine.\n\n123\n00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:22.890\nWell, It's true and it isn't true.\n\n124\n00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:25.290\nFor Macs made before 2010, it is true.\n\n125\n00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:26.450\nYou can do that.\n\n126\n00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:29.550\nYou can swap the memory sticks and\nthat'll reset the firmware password.\n\n127\n00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:33.360\nBut for\nMacs made after 2010 that doesn't work.\n\n128\n00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:34.760\nWell, it's the year 2016.\n\n129\n00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:37.210\nSo if you're running\na Mac made before 2010,\n\n130\n00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:39.280\nit's not supported by\nApple anymore anyway.\n\n131\n00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:41.070\nAnd so no new Mac can do that.\n\n132\n00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:43.510\nSo when you find those search results,\ndon't think that they're real.\n\n133\n00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:45.572\nYou do have to take it to an Apple store.\n\n134\n00:05:45.572 --> 00:05:47.820\nAll right,\nI'm going to shut this Mac down.\n\n135\n00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:51.370\nAnd the reason that I'm shutting it down\nis because I need to boot to recovery.\n\n136\n00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:54.170\nWhen we get into recovery mode that's\nwhere we're going to be able to set that\n\n137\n00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:55.360\nfirmware password.\n\n138\n00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:56.390\nSo it's going to shut down.\n\n139\n00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:58.630\nMy screen is going to go black for\na moment.\n\n140\n00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:03.550\nAnd what I'm going to do is I'm going\nto hold Command+R on my keyboard.\n\n141\n00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:04.840\nWhile I boot this thing up.\n\n142\n00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:06.678\nAnd, shoot, I slipped on a key.\n\n143\n00:06:06.678 --> 00:06:08.680\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] So we'll see.\n\n144\n00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:10.760\nI may or\nmay not make it into recovery on this one.\n\n145\n00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:13.810\nAnd once we get into recovery I'll be\nable to reset this firmware password.\n\n146\n00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:19.000\nSo remember, if you wanna boot to recovery\non your system there's two ways to do it.\n\n147\n00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.940\nIf you have a recovery\npartition on your system,\n\n148\n00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:25.640\nthen all you have to do is boot\nup holding the alt key, and\n\n149\n00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:28.730\nyou'll see the recovery partition\nas one of your bootable options.\n\n150\n00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:31.570\nIf you don't have a recovery partition,\nor even if you do,\n\n151\n00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:34.790\nreally, you can hold Command+R\nwhile you boot, it'll try and\n\n152\n00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:37.370\nboot straight to recovery\nwithout giving you the choice.\n\n153\n00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:39.670\nSo, I'm just going to boot to recovery,\nand, you know,\n\n154\n00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:42.860\nI'm saying I'm going to boot to recovery,\nlet me see if this is actually turned off,\n\n155\n00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:45.810\nI can't see my power, you know\nthe unit never actually turned off.\n\n156\n00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:47.700\nLet me just hold my power button here,\n\n157\n00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:51.790\nI need to make sure it turns off before\nI can truly boot it into recovery.\n\n158\n00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:54.660\nAlright, so now I'm going to\nhold Command+R on my keyboard.\n\n159\n00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:59.940\nI'm gonna press my old trusty power\nbutton and the unit is going to power on.\n\n160\n00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:02.160\nAnd we have to kinda sit here now.\n\n161\n00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:05.530\nWhen it boots up what's gonna happen\nis hopefully it's gonna boot into\n\n162\n00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:06.480\nrecovery for me.\n\n163\n00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:08.130\nYou're gonna see one of two things.\n\n164\n00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:11.020\nEither one, you'll see a black\nscreen like I am right now, and\n\n165\n00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:12.280\nthen eventually an Apple.\n\n166\n00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:14.250\nAnd eventually it'll\ntake me to the desktop.\n\n167\n00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:17.420\nOr two, I'll see a globe start to spin.\n\n168\n00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:18.860\nNow I'm hoping I don't see a globe.\n\n169\n00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:21.810\nBecause if I see a globe,\nit means I'm booting internet recovery.\n\n170\n00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:24.940\nAnd it's gotta reach out to Apple, and\ndownload the recovery partition, and\n\n171\n00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:25.800\nit's gonna take a while.\n\n172\n00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:28.610\nAnd I told you guys I was gonna try and\nget through this show quickly.\n\n173\n00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:30.450\nNot gonna happen with Internet recovery.\n\n174\n00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:32.950\nBut in my case,\nI do see the Apple, which is good.\n\n175\n00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:36.330\nThat means I'm I'm booting off of\nmy local recovery partition and\n\n176\n00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:37.750\nit's gonna boot up into that.\n\n177\n00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:42.860\nNow now once it boots into recovery,\nI'm gonna be given a smaller set of tools.\n\n178\n00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:46.900\nThe ability to instead OS 10,\nto restore from Time Machine, and\n\n179\n00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:50.860\nthen utilities, I'm gonna be\nable to set a firmware password.\n\n180\n00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:54.141\nSo I'll have that option in there\nto be able to set eventually.\n\n181\n00:07:54.141 --> 00:07:57.934\nSo this screen is gonna flicker\na few times as it moves to this and\n\n182\n00:07:57.934 --> 00:08:00.305\neventually we're gonna get in there.\n\n183\n00:08:00.305 --> 00:08:01.327\nAnd have [INAUDIBLE].\n\n184\n00:08:01.327 --> 00:08:02.326\nThere we go.\nAll right.\n\n185\n00:08:02.326 --> 00:08:06.324\nNow I do apologize for it being really\nsmall, when you boot into recovery it\n\n186\n00:08:06.324 --> 00:08:10.830\ndoesn't let you adjust your resolution and\nso this thing has jumped into what should\n\n187\n00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:15.460\nbe a high DPI resolution but it's doing\nit in regular DPI, it's really tiny.\n\n188\n00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:18.490\nBut if we go into our menus up here,\n\n189\n00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:23.740\nunder the Utility screen you'll see where\nwe've got our set firmware password and\n\n190\n00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:26.890\nso you can come and fire up this, it\nactually says firmware password utility,\n\n191\n00:08:26.890 --> 00:08:30.310\nI know it's microscopic but that's what\nit says firmware password utility.\n\n192\n00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:35.510\nAnd you can launch that and\nit's gonna let us set a firmware password,\n\n193\n00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:37.890\nand when I do that I can punch it in.\n\n194\n00:08:37.890 --> 00:08:41.000\nAnd it's now gonna be tied to\nthe motherboard of the system, so\n\n195\n00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.840\nwhenever it boots it's gonna ask for that.\n\n196\n00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:48.010\nSo I'm gonna punch in a password, and\n\n197\n00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:50.349\nDaniel help me remember here just\nin case I forget after the show.\n\n198\n00:08:50.349 --> 00:08:50.858\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n199\n00:08:50.858 --> 00:08:51.788\n>> I'm just gonna make it\n\n200\n00:08:51.788 --> 00:08:54.550\nthe word password, all lowercase.\nSo there, I've got it set and\n\n201\n00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:58.130\nit's in place, and I've now got\na firmware password on this system.\n\n202\n00:08:58.130 --> 00:09:00.790\nNow once it's set, I can remove it.\n\n203\n00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:04.470\nBy using the same feature I can\nboot to recovery and remove it.\n\n204\n00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:08.630\nBut in this case I've got it set,\nI now have that firmware password, and\n\n205\n00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:11.380\nI'm just gonna shut the system down again.\n\n206\n00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:15.380\nAnd once it's shut down, I'm gonna\nwait for it to actually power off, so\n\n207\n00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:17.590\nI'm gonna pretend like I'm an attacker,\nright?\n\n208\n00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:20.640\nI steal this computer, I just yank\nit out of the wall and run home.\n\n209\n00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:24.080\nAnd then once I get home I take it,\nI plug in and I go to power it on.\n\n210\n00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:27.040\nNow normally, when you power on a mac,\nit goes to boot off the hard drive.\n\n211\n00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:30.070\nBut on this one, it's gonna power on,\nand it's gonna ask me for\n\n212\n00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:31.460\nthe firmware password.\n\n213\n00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:32.920\nAnd I'm gonna punch the password in.\n\n214\n00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:36.010\nAnd if I don't have it,\nit's not gonna boot the operating system.\n\n215\n00:09:36.010 --> 00:09:39.200\nIt's not gonna let me,\npick to boot from a USB key.\n\n216\n00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:40.880\nLike, I can't even hold alt boot from USB.\n\n217\n00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:42.510\nIt won't let you do that.\n\n218\n00:09:42.510 --> 00:09:46.190\nIt's going to make you put in\nthat firmware password to get in.\n\n219\n00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:50.430\nNow, on some of our Macs, and I think this\nis one of them, it's gonna boot up and\n\n220\n00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:52.700\nI am actually gonna get\nthe operating system.\n\n221\n00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:56.020\nAnd you're gonna say to yourself well, why\ndidn't it give me the firmware password?\n\n222\n00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:58.870\nWell the reason it's not giving me\nthe firmware password is I'm booting to\n\n223\n00:09:58.870 --> 00:10:02.940\nthe OS, I've gotta have a username and\npassword to get into the OS.\n\n224\n00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:07.900\nAnd so it's only when I try and\nbypass this, when I try to bypass this and\n\n225\n00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:10.540\nnot boot to the OS that\nit's gonna make me do that.\n\n226\n00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:12.770\nSo if I shut it back down again.\n\n227\n00:10:12.770 --> 00:10:14.210\nI'm gonna turn it off.\n\n228\n00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:17.570\nAnd when I boot up this time, I'm gonna\nhold down the Alt key on my keyboard,\n\n229\n00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:19.430\nwhich is what I would normally\ndo if I was gonna try and\n\n230\n00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:24.260\nboot from USB or boot from CD,\nboot from something else like that.\n\n231\n00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:26.110\nAnd so when I hold the Alt key,\n\n232\n00:10:26.110 --> 00:10:30.200\nwhat I would normally get is a list\nof drives to try and boot from.\n\n233\n00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:33.570\nBut when this one comes up,\ninstead of giving me that list of drives\n\n234\n00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:36.830\nit's gonna give me the firmware\npassword screen right here.\n\n235\n00:10:36.830 --> 00:10:42.190\nI can't bypass the hard drive so,\nif I've got FileVault turned on,\n\n236\n00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:47.890\nI can boot to the encrypted drive and\nprovide my password or I can do nothing.\n\n237\n00:10:47.890 --> 00:10:51.420\nAnd if I rip this hard drive out and\nput a new hard drive in, doesn't matter.\n\n238\n00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:52.570\nI can still do nothing.\n\n239\n00:10:52.570 --> 00:10:56.380\nSo that firmware password supplements\nFileVault to give us the strongest\n\n240\n00:10:56.380 --> 00:10:57.440\npossible protection.\n\n241\n00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:59.600\nAnd it doesn't inconvenience us, does it?\n\n242\n00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:02.000\nCuz as long as I boot to\nthe hard drive I never see it.\n\n243\n00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.020\nBut if I try and bypass it,\nthat's where it's gonna prompt me and\n\n244\n00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:09.300\nI've gotta provide that password\nbefore I can try and bypass it.\n\n245\n00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:12.650\nAnd here I am, and I can pick between\nmy drive and recovery and so on.\n\n246\n00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:15.280\nSo, I'll need to boot to\nrecovery to remove that password.\n\n247\n00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:18.450\nBut as far as this one,\nthat's the firmware password.\n\n248\n00:11:18.450 --> 00:11:21.490\nWhen I'm done with it, I can just boot\nit into recovery, go right back into\n\n249\n00:11:21.490 --> 00:11:24.880\nthe firmware password utility, and\nremove the password so it's not there.\n\n250\n00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:27.350\nAnd I'm gonna do it here, cuz otherwise\nI'll forget what the password is.\n\n251\n00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:29.940\nTen minutes after this show's over.\n\n252\n00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:31.730\n>> [LAUGH] Well, and\nthat brings up a good point.\n\n253\n00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:33.920\nThis is a really quick way\nto brick your system, right?\n\n254\n00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:35.120\nIf you put in a password for\n\n255\n00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:38.660\nthis thing and you forget it,\nwell that is not a good thing, right?\n\n256\n00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:40.030\nYou're gonna have to either.\n\n257\n00:11:40.030 --> 00:11:42.970\nAre even able to take it Apple and\nthen fix it, Don?\n\n258\n00:11:42.970 --> 00:11:44.910\n>> Yeah.\n>> Okay, so you can take it to Apple.\n\n259\n00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:48.300\nThat's good but if you maybe, you bought\na third party, you got an eBay thing in.\n\n260\n00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:48.990\n>> That's a problem.\n\n261\n00:11:48.990 --> 00:11:53.260\n>> You've done that, you're in for a hard\ntime so, be aware and be careful and\n\n262\n00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:54.760\nthe password responsibly [LAUGH].\n\n263\n00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:56.190\n>> Yep.\n>> That being said or\n\n264\n00:11:56.190 --> 00:11:58.780\ngonna do something a little completely\ndifferent eventhough it's very security\n\n265\n00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:01.690\nrelated, that's the idea of anti-virus,\nright.\n\n266\n00:12:01.690 --> 00:12:06.300\nWe have viruses, we have bad things not\ndone then, here's the thing about Mac's.\n\n267\n00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:08.690\nEverybody says,\nyou don't need antivirus for Macs, right?\n\n268\n00:12:08.690 --> 00:12:10.700\nYou're safe,\nyou don't have to worry about that.\n\n269\n00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:13.580\nSo why are we talking about antiviruses?\n\n270\n00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:16.760\n>> Well, so, Macs are safe, right?\n\n271\n00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:17.570\nThat's what people say.\n\n272\n00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:18.420\nThey don't get viruses.\n\n273\n00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:22.675\nAnd for a long time that was true, and the\nmain reason it was true was just because\n\n274\n00:12:22.675 --> 00:12:25.275\nMac had such, Apple had such\na small market share, right?\n\n275\n00:12:25.275 --> 00:12:27.995\nThere was such a small percentage of\ncomputers out there that were running\n\n276\n00:12:27.995 --> 00:12:30.205\nMac OS that if you were a hacker,\n\n277\n00:12:30.205 --> 00:12:33.595\nan attacker that was out there, you'd\ntarget an OS that was widely deployed.\n\n278\n00:12:33.595 --> 00:12:38.400\nYou'd target Windows because there were\nMillions of Windows installs out there\n\n279\n00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:41.820\nversus targeting a Mac where there are\nonly hundreds of thousands of installs.\n\n280\n00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:44.270\nWell, Apple's been gaining market share.\n\n281\n00:12:44.270 --> 00:12:46.910\nThey've been growing and\ngrowing out there, year after year.\n\n282\n00:12:46.910 --> 00:12:50.650\nSo we're starting to see a lot more\nMacs out there than we used to and\n\n283\n00:12:50.650 --> 00:12:52.820\nit's making them more and\nmore of a target.\n\n284\n00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:56.460\nThey increased their attack\nsurface every single year.\n\n285\n00:12:56.460 --> 00:13:00.110\nThe other thing is, Apple,\nit's not that they never get a virus.\n\n286\n00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:02.850\nIt's not that they never get malware,\nthere's plenty of it out there, just do\n\n287\n00:13:02.850 --> 00:13:05.650\na Google search for Keyranger, you'll\nsee one that's out there right now for\n\n288\n00:13:05.650 --> 00:13:07.950\nMacs that does encryption,\nit's ransomware.\n\n289\n00:13:07.950 --> 00:13:14.150\nWell, but the thing is, unlike the other\nvendors, when a new malware or\n\n290\n00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:18.520\nvirus or whatever comes out for a Mac,\nApple pushes an update to fix it.\n\n291\n00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:19.450\nApple controls the hardware.\n\n292\n00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:20.790\nThey know what hardware you're running.\n\n293\n00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:21.760\nThey know the operating system.\n\n294\n00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:23.540\nThey control that entire ecosystem.\n\n295\n00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:27.170\nSo when there's a virus out\nthere they can push the fix.\n\n296\n00:13:27.170 --> 00:13:31.540\nVersus Microsoft where there might be\na virus that exploits a Dell driver and\n\n297\n00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:33.620\nMicrosoft can't fix that;\nDell has to fix it.\n\n298\n00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:35.340\nThere's too many parties involved.\n\n299\n00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:38.240\nBut, ont he Apple side,\nit's all Apple they made the hardware,\n\n300\n00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:41.250\nthey made the driver, they made the OS so,\nthey can push fixes whenever they want and\n\n301\n00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:42.290\nthey often do.\n\n302\n00:13:42.290 --> 00:13:46.760\nAnd so, most people don't\nworry about an antivirus but,\n\n303\n00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:50.890\nthose same people could still get like\nrun somewhere like the keyranger,\n\n304\n00:13:50.890 --> 00:13:56.290\nit run somewhere that's just last week so,\nit's very real, it's very possible.\n\n305\n00:13:56.290 --> 00:13:57.950\nAnd it's something we\nneed to protect against.\n\n306\n00:13:57.950 --> 00:14:01.540\nAnd so we are starting to see\nantivirus products come out for Mac.\n\n307\n00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:02.820\nNormally, we are taking care of it.\n\n308\n00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:05.960\nWay back in part one, we talked about\nsystem integrity protection and\n\n309\n00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:10.730\nhow it really sand boxes apps and\nprotects us from what a lot of viruses do.\n\n310\n00:14:10.730 --> 00:14:13.456\nBut if you wanna supplement that,\nyou can use third-party anti-virus.\n\n311\n00:14:13.456 --> 00:14:19.110\nFor example here on my laptop I\ngot a Mac client pulled up and\n\n312\n00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:22.280\nup here,\nI'm running the Sophos Home antivirus.\n\n313\n00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:23.230\nSophos Home is free.\n\n314\n00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:25.630\nYou can go to Sophos' website,\nyou can download it, install it.\n\n315\n00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:27.840\nI think they let you manage\nup to five computers with it.\n\n316\n00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:29.500\nThey've got it for Mac, Windows, Linux.\n\n317\n00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:33.490\nYou can install it and\nit's just antivirus for your Mac.\n\n318\n00:14:33.490 --> 00:14:35.320\nAnd so you can scan and\nit will protect you.\n\n319\n00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:37.580\nSee how I've got my\nautomatic virus protection.\n\n320\n00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:42.030\nI've got web filtering and potentially\nunwanted app protection all turned on, so\n\n321\n00:14:42.030 --> 00:14:44.840\nif I get an infection on this machine,\nor if I try and download malware,\n\n322\n00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:47.160\nit will pick it up, and it will stop it.\n\n323\n00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:51.490\nAnd I can do a scan on my files, and\nit's gonna look though and do a quick\n\n324\n00:14:51.490 --> 00:14:55.980\ncheck just to see, If I've got any\ninfected files on my systems right now.\n\n325\n00:14:55.980 --> 00:14:59.250\nAnd find out what's there and\nprotect us, right?\n\n326\n00:14:59.250 --> 00:15:03.300\nSo the guys over at Sophos they have a\nsecurity lab that's constantly researching\n\n327\n00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:04.950\nnew threats that are out\nthere on the internet.\n\n328\n00:15:04.950 --> 00:15:08.750\nAnd as soon as they detect one they add\nit to Sophos so they can detect it and\n\n329\n00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:09.430\nprotect us from it.\n\n330\n00:15:09.430 --> 00:15:10.830\nSo there it goes scanning.\n\n331\n00:15:10.830 --> 00:15:11.460\nI've got antivirus.\n\n332\n00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:14.070\nSo it's not that there aren't\nantivirus products out there.\n\n333\n00:15:14.070 --> 00:15:17.490\nAnd some people say, antivirus is a sham,\nthey're just doing that to make money.\n\n334\n00:15:17.490 --> 00:15:19.110\nWell, here's a product that's free.\n\n335\n00:15:19.110 --> 00:15:21.250\nThey're not making money off of this.\n\n336\n00:15:21.250 --> 00:15:24.000\nAnd you can deploy it and\nit's an extra level of security.\n\n337\n00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.720\nSo antivirus is not required on a Mac.\n\n338\n00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:29.500\nBut that doesn't mean\nthere's no purpose for it.\n\n339\n00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:32.000\nIt is good to have a second\nopinion somebody in addition to\n\n340\n00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.240\nApple monitoring those systems and\nletting you know that they're clean.\n\n341\n00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:38.100\n>> Yeah, now Don obviously\nanti-virus is a good thing.\n\n342\n00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:38.982\nWe wanna install.\n\n343\n00:15:38.982 --> 00:15:41.980\nYou wanna make sure it's just\nanother level of protection and\n\n344\n00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:43.600\nit never hurts to have that installed.\n\n345\n00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:45.560\nIt's not like it's killing your computer.\n\n346\n00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:48.660\nIt's actually doing something good for\nit so keep that in mind.\n\n347\n00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:51.180\nBack in a previous episode,\nactually one of our security episodes.\n\n348\n00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:54.000\nI think it was the last one,\npart two, or maybe it was part one.\n\n349\n00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:55.571\nAnd we talked about the Gatekeeper.\n\n350\n00:15:55.571 --> 00:15:59.198\nYou started dropping hints about\nGatekeeper and what it can do.\n\n351\n00:15:59.198 --> 00:16:02.127\nAnd this is built into the Mac\noperating system, correct?\n\n352\n00:16:02.127 --> 00:16:05.511\n>> Right, yeah, so one of the things\nthat we saw here with Sophos,\n\n353\n00:16:05.511 --> 00:16:09.500\nit has Potentially Unwanted App Detection,\nthis guy right here, right?\n\n354\n00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:12.560\nSo it's looking for applications\nthat you might not want to run, and\n\n355\n00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:14.170\nSophos keeps a list of that.\n\n356\n00:16:14.170 --> 00:16:17.200\nWell, Apple takes a different\napproach to that.\n\n357\n00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:18.020\nApple basically says,\n\n358\n00:16:18.020 --> 00:16:20.860\nif this is anything from the Internet\nwe probably don't want it.\n\n359\n00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:24.980\nApple says, if you want a safe app you\ncan trust, get it from our app store.\n\n360\n00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:28.140\nBut any app that comes from\na source other than the app store,\n\n361\n00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:29.620\nApple doesn't trust it.\n\n362\n00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:33.080\nSo when you download an app, and you go\nto run it for the first time, it's not\n\n363\n00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:36.930\ntrusted, and that's the Gatekeeper\nfunctionality that's kicking in there.\n\n364\n00:16:36.930 --> 00:16:41.140\nSo for example,\nlet's say that I want Firefox, right.\n\n365\n00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:44.935\nSo I want Mozilla Firefox for\nmy browser on the Mac.\n\n366\n00:16:44.935 --> 00:16:47.122\nSo I go out to the Internet,\nand I go to download it, so\n\n367\n00:16:47.122 --> 00:16:49.782\nI'm just gonna go out here and\ndownload it, and install it now.\n\n368\n00:16:49.782 --> 00:16:54.390\nThe Mozilla organization has\nbeen around a long time.\n\n369\n00:16:54.390 --> 00:16:59.530\nThe Firefox browser is widely downloaded,\ntons of people know this one and trust it.\n\n370\n00:16:59.530 --> 00:17:02.910\nThis is not some fly-by-night\ncompany we've never heard of,\n\n371\n00:17:02.910 --> 00:17:05.730\nthis is a legitimate product.\n\n372\n00:17:05.730 --> 00:17:08.530\nBut, your Mac is not gonna trust it,\nright?\n\n373\n00:17:08.530 --> 00:17:11.630\nSo it's gonna download, and\nwhen I add it to my Application folder and\n\n374\n00:17:11.630 --> 00:17:15.780\nrun it the first time,\nit's an untrusted application.\n\n375\n00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:19.030\nAnd so Gatekeeper kicks in and\nstops it from running.\n\n376\n00:17:19.030 --> 00:17:22.810\nIt is not allowed to run\nuntil we authorize it.\n\n377\n00:17:22.810 --> 00:17:25.430\nThat's the default functionality on a Mac.\n\n378\n00:17:25.430 --> 00:17:30.550\nSo if I take this Firefox installer, soon\nas it's done any moment now, there we go.\n\n379\n00:17:30.550 --> 00:17:34.272\nI can just drag and drop Firefox\ninto my Applications folder, and so\n\n380\n00:17:34.272 --> 00:17:37.689\nnow it's installed, well,\nas soon as it finishes copying.\n\n381\n00:17:37.689 --> 00:17:39.869\nAnd then I can go into my\nApplications folder and I can run it.\n\n382\n00:17:39.869 --> 00:17:43.487\nAnd when I run it, it's gonna tell me\nthat that application was downloaded from\n\n383\n00:17:43.487 --> 00:17:47.007\nthe Internet, and it's gonna ask me\nwhether or not I really want to run that.\n\n384\n00:17:47.007 --> 00:17:51.388\nSo, if I go under Applications,\nand I find Firefox.\n\n385\n00:17:51.388 --> 00:17:52.748\nThere it is.\n\n386\n00:17:52.748 --> 00:17:54.728\nAnd I'm gonna run Firefox.\n\n387\n00:17:54.728 --> 00:17:55.707\nAnd here it is.\n\n388\n00:17:55.707 --> 00:17:58.146\nFirefox is an application\ndownloaded from the Internet.\n\n389\n00:17:58.146 --> 00:18:01.746\nAre you sure you want to open it,\nyes or no, right?\n\n390\n00:18:01.746 --> 00:18:03.425\nI can Cancel it or I can Open it.\n\n391\n00:18:03.425 --> 00:18:06.536\nIf I trust it, and I say,\nyeah I trust it, I'll go ahead and do it,\n\n392\n00:18:06.536 --> 00:18:07.665\nI'll open it, right?\n\n393\n00:18:07.665 --> 00:18:11.505\nNow the KeRanger malware that I mentioned\nearlier, it distributed the same way.\n\n394\n00:18:11.505 --> 00:18:14.563\nThey packaged it with\nthe Transmission BitTorrent client, and so\n\n395\n00:18:14.563 --> 00:18:18.058\nwhen you installed Transmission,\nyou'd say yeah go ahead and open it, and\n\n396\n00:18:18.058 --> 00:18:21.184\nit would install the Ransomware KeRanger\nat the same time, right.\n\n397\n00:18:21.184 --> 00:18:23.100\nSo that's how things piggyback.\n\n398\n00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:25.349\nI really have to trust this to hit Open.\n\n399\n00:18:25.349 --> 00:18:28.851\nAnd if I do, I'm saying, it might be\nable to do all sorts of crazy stuff, but\n\n400\n00:18:28.851 --> 00:18:32.609\nI'm okay with that, I'm gonna run it, and\nlet's do it, let's just give it a go, and\n\n401\n00:18:32.609 --> 00:18:33.509\noff we are, right.\n\n402\n00:18:33.509 --> 00:18:37.329\nSo, that's a challenge that we\nhave when we override Gatekeeper.\n\n403\n00:18:37.329 --> 00:18:40.247\nBut Gatekeeper is something that\nwe can customize and change,\n\n404\n00:18:40.247 --> 00:18:42.569\nthe settings are available for\nus to manipulate.\n\n405\n00:18:42.569 --> 00:18:46.273\nIf you go into your System Preferences,\nand I'm getting a little window happy,\n\n406\n00:18:46.273 --> 00:18:47.969\nlet me close out of some of this junk.\n\n407\n00:18:47.969 --> 00:18:52.476\nIf you go into your System Preferences,\nand go into Security & Privacy,\n\n408\n00:18:52.476 --> 00:18:56.489\nGatekeeper has a tab in there we\ncan customize the settings of it.\n\n409\n00:18:56.489 --> 00:18:59.801\nSo eventually,\nmy system's running a little slower,\n\n410\n00:18:59.801 --> 00:19:01.849\ncuz I'm running that virus scan.\n\n411\n00:19:01.849 --> 00:19:02.597\nThere we go.\n\n412\n00:19:02.597 --> 00:19:04.597\nSo I'm gonna get into Security & Privacy.\n\n413\n00:19:04.597 --> 00:19:07.561\nAnd when I'm in here,\nif you take a look at some\n\n414\n00:19:07.561 --> 00:19:12.431\nof the stuff that we've got under\nthe General tab, you'll see right here,\n\n415\n00:19:12.431 --> 00:19:16.948\nAllow apps downloaded from, and\nit's got some choices, all right.\n\n416\n00:19:16.948 --> 00:19:21.608\nIt doesn't say Gatekeeper, but this is\nthe Gatekeeper functionality right here.\n\n417\n00:19:21.608 --> 00:19:24.807\nAnd what it's doing is\nit's basically saying,\n\n418\n00:19:24.807 --> 00:19:29.890\nwe're gonna trust apps from the Mac\nApp Store, and identified developers.\n\n419\n00:19:29.890 --> 00:19:31.820\nNow what's an identified developer?\n\n420\n00:19:31.820 --> 00:19:34.330\nI mean surely Mozilla is\nan identified developer.\n\n421\n00:19:34.330 --> 00:19:37.440\nOr in the earlier episode that Daniel\nmentioned I did Google Chrome.\n\n422\n00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:39.920\nI would assume Google's a known developer.\n\n423\n00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:43.120\nWell, they're talking about developers\nthat have had their application\n\n424\n00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:46.150\ndigitally signed by Apple.\n\n425\n00:19:46.150 --> 00:19:47.270\nAnd Google hasn't done that.\n\n426\n00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:48.390\nAnd Mozilla hasn't done that.\n\n427\n00:19:48.390 --> 00:19:49.949\nThey're not digitally signed by Apple.\n\n428\n00:19:49.949 --> 00:19:52.024\nIf they want that,\nApple says hey no problem,\n\n429\n00:19:52.024 --> 00:19:54.909\nwhy don't you distribute your\nbrowsers through our app store?\n\n430\n00:19:54.909 --> 00:19:57.637\nAnd then they will be digitally signed\nby us and you'll be protected, but\n\n431\n00:19:57.637 --> 00:19:58.829\nthat's not how it is normally.\n\n432\n00:19:58.829 --> 00:20:02.839\nSo, the other apps count as something\nbeing installed from Anywhere, and\n\n433\n00:20:02.839 --> 00:20:05.210\nthat's being blocked by default.\n\n434\n00:20:05.210 --> 00:20:10.370\nI can change this,\nif I unlock the screen, and I can say,\n\n435\n00:20:10.370 --> 00:20:13.001\nlet it from Anywhere, and that's\neffectively gonna disable Gatekeeper.\n\n436\n00:20:14.092 --> 00:20:16.480\nIt's gonna let me install applications,\nand\n\n437\n00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:19.050\nit's never gonna warn me about\nwhere they're coming from.\n\n438\n00:20:19.050 --> 00:20:22.360\nAnd notice what it's doing here, it's\nactually not gonna, Allow From Anywhere.\n\n439\n00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:26.859\nIt says, This selection will be reset\nautomatically if unused for 30 days.\n\n440\n00:20:26.859 --> 00:20:31.219\nSo if you don't use it for 30 days,\nit's gonna turn it back on, right?\n\n441\n00:20:31.219 --> 00:20:33.839\nAnd that's because you're weakening\nthe security of your system.\n\n442\n00:20:33.839 --> 00:20:36.738\nYou don't want unauthorized\napplications to be able to run,\n\n443\n00:20:36.738 --> 00:20:39.380\nbecause a virus isn't\nan authorized application.\n\n444\n00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:41.620\nIs a virus gonna be\ndigitally signed by Apple?\n\n445\n00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:42.179\nNo.\n\n446\n00:20:42.179 --> 00:20:43.878\n[LAUGH] Is it gonna be\nsigned by a known developer?\n\n447\n00:20:43.878 --> 00:20:45.098\nNo, that's not how it works.\n\n448\n00:20:45.098 --> 00:20:49.347\nSo, we're not going to be susceptible if\nthis is turned on, if we turned it off,\n\n449\n00:20:49.347 --> 00:20:50.418\nwe're in trouble.\n\n450\n00:20:50.418 --> 00:20:51.986\n>> That'd be an interesting day for\n\n451\n00:20:51.986 --> 00:20:54.455\nApple stock if they [LAUGH]\ndigitally signed a virus.\n\n452\n00:20:54.455 --> 00:20:55.516\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah,\n\n453\n00:20:55.516 --> 00:20:57.909\nthat would open some people's eyes.\n\n454\n00:20:57.909 --> 00:21:01.476\nBut we can make it more restrictive,\nwe can say just the app store,\n\n455\n00:21:01.476 --> 00:21:05.616\nI don't want third party apps at all,\nI'm gonna really limit it to here, and\n\n456\n00:21:05.616 --> 00:21:06.909\nlock that down, okay.\n\n457\n00:21:06.909 --> 00:21:09.768\nNow, once we've done that,\nyou're now kinda protected.\n\n458\n00:21:09.768 --> 00:21:13.008\nThere are some apps, if I get an app\nthat's completely unidentified,\n\n459\n00:21:13.008 --> 00:21:16.688\nthat's not digitally signed by anybody,\nit actually won't let me install it.\n\n460\n00:21:16.688 --> 00:21:20.043\nAnd the way that we get around that is\nif you need to install an app that's not\n\n461\n00:21:20.043 --> 00:21:22.929\ndigitally signed by anybody,\neven somebody you don't trust?\n\n462\n00:21:22.929 --> 00:21:27.204\nWhat you have to do,\nis if you take that application,\n\n463\n00:21:27.204 --> 00:21:33.289\nyou can Ctrl+click on it, and\nwhen you Ctrl+click, you can choose Open.\n\n464\n00:21:33.289 --> 00:21:37.175\nNow that's normally the same as\ndouble-clicking, but in the Gatekeeper it\n\n465\n00:21:37.175 --> 00:21:40.792\nsays, allow somebody to open this\neven if it's not digitally signed.\n\n466\n00:21:40.792 --> 00:21:42.830\nYou will still get a prompt that says,\nare you sure?\n\n467\n00:21:42.830 --> 00:21:44.239\nBut that's kind how you get around that.\n\n468\n00:21:44.239 --> 00:21:47.199\nBut the Gatekeeper's a feature\nthat's running in the background,\n\n469\n00:21:47.199 --> 00:21:48.739\nyou can tighten the security on it.\n\n470\n00:21:48.739 --> 00:21:51.619\nBut the default security's pretty good,\nand it's what we normally want.\n\n471\n00:21:51.619 --> 00:21:55.578\n>> All right, well obviously Gatekeeper,\nthat's a great little item for us to have.\n\n472\n00:21:55.578 --> 00:21:57.278\nSo jump in there and\ncheck out with your Mac.\n\n473\n00:21:57.278 --> 00:21:58.830\nStart playing with the Gatekeeper.\n\n474\n00:21:58.830 --> 00:22:00.135\nAnd you probably already have,\n\n475\n00:22:00.135 --> 00:22:02.590\nif you've worked with your\nMac at any length of time.\n\n476\n00:22:02.590 --> 00:22:04.260\nI know that I have,\nI remember the first time I ran into it,\n\n477\n00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:05.250\nI was like, what is this?\n\n478\n00:22:05.250 --> 00:22:06.350\nTrying to install this program.\n\n479\n00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:09.080\nI downloaded it from the Internet,\nI'm sure it's safe.\n\n480\n00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:11.548\nAnd it was like, hey yeah, probably not.\n\n481\n00:22:11.548 --> 00:22:14.440\nWe're just trying to keep a check and\nbalance on those types of things.\n\n482\n00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:15.980\nKeep the bad guys out of your system.\n\n483\n00:22:15.980 --> 00:22:18.075\nBut granted, there's some of\nthe things that Don just showed you,\n\n484\n00:22:18.075 --> 00:22:19.229\nand it was off to the races with that.\n\n485\n00:22:19.229 --> 00:22:20.767\nI think it was Firefox\nto be honest with you.\n\n486\n00:22:20.767 --> 00:22:21.287\n>> Probably.\n\n487\n00:22:21.287 --> 00:22:22.567\n>> Cuz I run that browser.\n\n488\n00:22:22.567 --> 00:22:28.000\nNow, let's move on to our final little\nitem that we have to talk about.\n\n489\n00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:32.560\nIn any operating system worth its salt,\nis going to have some level of\n\n490\n00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:37.040\nbuilt in security known as a firewall,\nand Mac is no different right, Don?\n\n491\n00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:38.970\n>> Right, so\nwe're talking about network security now.\n\n492\n00:22:38.970 --> 00:22:40.858\nSecuring our communications\nover a network.\n\n493\n00:22:40.858 --> 00:22:43.361\nIf you gotta stand alone Mac,\nyou don't care about this, but\n\n494\n00:22:43.361 --> 00:22:45.768\nwho's not connected to the Internet\nthese days, one way or\n\n495\n00:22:45.768 --> 00:22:47.859\nanother you are, and so\nwe need protection there.\n\n496\n00:22:47.859 --> 00:22:54.139\nWell, by default, a Mac will allow any\ncommunication to exit or come in, right.\n\n497\n00:22:54.139 --> 00:22:58.102\nSo there's a lot of features and services\navailable on your Mac that outside people\n\n498\n00:22:58.102 --> 00:22:59.940\nare allowed to connect to by default.\n\n499\n00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:01.700\nAnd you probably don't want that.\n\n500\n00:23:01.700 --> 00:23:05.400\nSo we can use the Mac firewall\nto protect us from that.\n\n501\n00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:08.790\nAnd it actually is configured a little\nbit by default to protect you from most\n\n502\n00:23:08.790 --> 00:23:11.170\nthings, but\nyou can tighten it up a little bit more.\n\n503\n00:23:11.170 --> 00:23:14.082\nSo there is a software\nfirewall built into your Mac,\n\n504\n00:23:14.082 --> 00:23:16.139\nyou just have to turn it on and use it.\n\n505\n00:23:16.139 --> 00:23:19.779\nSo let me show you that,\nif we go into our System Preferences,\n\n506\n00:23:19.779 --> 00:23:21.879\nand we go into Security & Privacy.\n\n507\n00:23:21.879 --> 00:23:23.610\nYou probably noticed it earlier, but\n\n508\n00:23:23.610 --> 00:23:26.319\nwhen I go into Security &\nPrivacy I've got a Firewall tab.\n\n509\n00:23:26.319 --> 00:23:30.539\nAnd when you go to the Firewall,\nit's off by default, right?\n\n510\n00:23:30.539 --> 00:23:31.703\nNow it's not 100% off,\n\n511\n00:23:31.703 --> 00:23:35.490\nthere are a few things that Apple's doing\nin the background to protect your system.\n\n512\n00:23:35.490 --> 00:23:38.030\nBut the Firewall itself for\nthe most part, is turned off,\n\n513\n00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:40.680\nthat it's allowing certain connections\nthat you may or may not want.\n\n514\n00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:44.210\nSo for example,\nlet's say I turn on Remote Management.\n\n515\n00:23:44.210 --> 00:23:49.570\nIf I turn on Remote Management, so if I go\nback here and I go to Sharing, and I turn\n\n516\n00:23:49.570 --> 00:23:55.100\non Remote Login or Remote Management,\nthat's gonna enable SSH access to my Mac.\n\n517\n00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:58.081\nTechnically, anybody in the world,\nif I go to a hotel,\n\n518\n00:23:58.081 --> 00:24:01.390\nanybody on that network at the hotel,\ncould SSH to my laptop.\n\n519\n00:24:01.390 --> 00:24:04.696\nNow, they're gonna need a username and\npassword and they're not gonna have that.\n\n520\n00:24:04.696 --> 00:24:07.590\nBut they can open a session and\nthey can brute force it and\n\n521\n00:24:07.590 --> 00:24:10.060\nthat may not be something that I want.\n\n522\n00:24:10.060 --> 00:24:15.420\nSo when I turn this on,\nI could then go into the firewall and\n\n523\n00:24:15.420 --> 00:24:18.960\nrestrict what IP's are allowed\nto connect to me via SSH.\n\n524\n00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:21.000\nI can go a step further, right?\n\n525\n00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:24.100\nAnd so to do that we need to turn it on,\nso the first thing I'm gonna do is unlock\n\n526\n00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:27.770\nthis screen and\nthen I'm gonna turn on the firewall.\n\n527\n00:24:27.770 --> 00:24:30.260\nNow it's on, I'm done,\nshortest feature ever, right?\n\n528\n00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:31.840\nWell you can turn it on and\n\n529\n00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:36.160\nonce it's on the default is,\nany outgoing communication is allowed.\n\n530\n00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:39.970\nAnd any incoming communication is gonna be\nblocked unless it's in response to one of\n\n531\n00:24:39.970 --> 00:24:41.570\nmy outgoing communications.\n\n532\n00:24:41.570 --> 00:24:44.030\nSo we're really limiting\nwho can talk to us.\n\n533\n00:24:44.030 --> 00:24:46.090\nBut you can go to firewall options and\n\n534\n00:24:46.090 --> 00:24:51.050\nright here you can start to enable and\nallow communications in and out.\n\n535\n00:24:51.050 --> 00:24:54.620\nNow out is allowed by default so\nwe don't have to mess with that, but\n\n536\n00:24:54.620 --> 00:24:58.300\nincoming you'll see mine's are all\nready allowing Apple file protocol.\n\n537\n00:24:58.300 --> 00:25:00.280\nBut SSH is not on the list, so\n\n538\n00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:04.820\neven if I enable SSH functionality, people\naren't gonna be able to connect, right?\n\n539\n00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:10.810\nSo, if I go back to Sharing, and\nI'm gonna turn on Remote Login,\n\n540\n00:25:10.810 --> 00:25:13.790\nand Remote Management, so\nI'm gonna turn those two on.\n\n541\n00:25:13.790 --> 00:25:18.370\nAnd we're not, I'm not using\nApple remote desktop right now,\n\n542\n00:25:18.370 --> 00:25:20.900\nbut maybe I wanna turn this on in\ncase I wanna use it in the future.\n\n543\n00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:26.070\nSo I'm just gonna turn these things on and\nget all that set up, there we go.\n\n544\n00:25:26.070 --> 00:25:29.250\nAnd now when I go back to my firewall,\ngo to Security and Privacy,\n\n545\n00:25:29.250 --> 00:25:32.610\nFirewall, Firewall Options,\nlook what it did.\n\n546\n00:25:32.610 --> 00:25:36.600\nSee it turned on Remote Login which is\nSSH, and it turn on Remote Management,\n\n547\n00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:37.490\nScreen Sharing,\n\n548\n00:25:37.490 --> 00:25:40.480\nthe firewall is automatically updating to\nreflect the features that I turned on.\n\n549\n00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:46.080\nAnd it's allowing those communications and\nit's just allowing them into this system.\n\n550\n00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:50.600\nBut I can manipulate that if I want to,\nto change I can add more things.\n\n551\n00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:53.540\nSo, maybe I install like a little\nApache server on my system,\n\n552\n00:25:53.540 --> 00:25:55.880\nand I want to allow web access to it.\n\n553\n00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:57.690\nI can hit Add, and I can come in and\n\n554\n00:25:57.690 --> 00:26:01.510\nI can pick the program that's\nrunning my web server and add it.\n\n555\n00:26:01.510 --> 00:26:05.350\nAnd now any port that it opens up,\nwill be allowed to come in and\n\n556\n00:26:05.350 --> 00:26:07.080\nI'll have that functionality.\n\n557\n00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:10.680\nNow this firewall is not the most\namazing advanced firewall in the world,\n\n558\n00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:12.850\nthere's software firewalls\nout there that are better.\n\n559\n00:26:12.850 --> 00:26:14.620\nBut this one's free,\nit's built into the OS,\n\n560\n00:26:14.620 --> 00:26:19.070\nyou can turn it on and it really limits\noutside traffic coming into your Mac.\n\n561\n00:26:19.070 --> 00:26:21.470\nSo that's one feature\nthat we have available,\n\n562\n00:26:21.470 --> 00:26:24.020\nthat can help improve our security.\n\n563\n00:26:24.020 --> 00:26:28.280\nAnd you've even got this one down here\nthat I kind of like which is stealth mode.\n\n564\n00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:31.400\nNormally, an attacker will do what's\ncalled a ping sweep on a network to see\n\n565\n00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:33.040\nwhat devices are out there.\n\n566\n00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:36.580\nAnd what they do is send out a ping and\nother machines will respond to the ping.\n\n567\n00:26:36.580 --> 00:26:39.570\nStealth mode will stop your\nmachine from responding.\n\n568\n00:26:39.570 --> 00:26:42.250\nAnd so now an attacker won't even\nsee you on the network and so\n\n569\n00:26:42.250 --> 00:26:43.270\nthen you're not a target.\n\n570\n00:26:43.270 --> 00:26:45.120\nIt helps to improve that security,\n\n571\n00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:47.770\nit does make it hard to\ntroubleshoot your network though.\n\n572\n00:26:47.770 --> 00:26:51.190\nLike hey, I can't see this computer on\nthe network, let me see if I can ping it.\n\n573\n00:26:51.190 --> 00:26:53.910\nI can't ping it,\nwell it was in stealth mode, right?\n\n574\n00:26:53.910 --> 00:26:54.570\nI couldn't see it.\n\n575\n00:26:54.570 --> 00:26:57.540\nSo you have to be aware of that but\nif you're in a hotel network or\n\n576\n00:26:57.540 --> 00:27:00.960\nsomewhere, you can turn these options\non to really improve that security.\n\n577\n00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:02.582\nBlocking those communications coming in.\n\n578\n00:27:02.582 --> 00:27:06.100\nAll right, there's one more\nthing that I want to point out,\n\n579\n00:27:06.100 --> 00:27:07.920\nthe exam doesn't go too heavy on it.\n\n580\n00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:11.640\nBut you've got the firewall,\nthat helps you secure traffic coming in.\n\n581\n00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:14.180\nBut if you're communicating\nacross the Internet,\n\n582\n00:27:14.180 --> 00:27:15.860\nit's an insecure network by default.\n\n583\n00:27:15.860 --> 00:27:19.980\nAnybody could intercept your traffic,\nso we need to encrypt our data.\n\n584\n00:27:19.980 --> 00:27:24.440\nAnd Mac OS supports VPNs,\nit has VPN functionality built into it.\n\n585\n00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:27.540\nIf I go back to my\nSystem Preferences here and\n\n586\n00:27:27.540 --> 00:27:30.680\nI'm just gonna go into my network screen.\n\n587\n00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:33.450\nAnd in the network screen I normally\nsee my physical interfaces,\n\n588\n00:27:33.450 --> 00:27:36.440\nlike here I see Ethernet,\nas my physical Ethernet adapter.\n\n589\n00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:40.210\nBut I can hit the little plus sign\ndown here and add a new connection.\n\n590\n00:27:40.210 --> 00:27:44.850\nAnd when you do, so I can pick VPN,\nI can create a Virtual Private Network,\n\n591\n00:27:44.850 --> 00:27:48.980\nan encrypted connection between me and\na remote location.\n\n592\n00:27:48.980 --> 00:27:52.480\nI use this all the time, when I'm at\na hotel or a conference center or\n\n593\n00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:53.550\nsomewhere like that.\n\n594\n00:27:53.550 --> 00:27:55.160\nI don't trust the network I'm own.\n\n595\n00:27:55.160 --> 00:28:00.780\nSo I'll VPN back to here or I'll VPN back\nto my home cuz I trust those networks and\n\n596\n00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:01.900\nI've got a secure communication.\n\n597\n00:28:01.900 --> 00:28:05.520\nSo you'll see I've got like IKEv2,\nwhich is the Internet or\n\n598\n00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:10.320\nkey exchange very very common used\nwith IPSec, we've got a Cisco IPSec,\n\n599\n00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:12.515\nwhich is really just a variation of IKEv2.\n\n600\n00:28:12.515 --> 00:28:15.770\nPoint-to-Point Tunneling Protocol\nwhich is the older and\n\n601\n00:28:15.770 --> 00:28:19.330\nweaker protocol, and\nLayer Two Tunneling Protocol over IPSec,\n\n602\n00:28:19.330 --> 00:28:21.410\nthat's usually used with\nMicrosoft networks.\n\n603\n00:28:21.410 --> 00:28:23.540\nSo, we've got four different\nprotocols we can pick from,\n\n604\n00:28:23.540 --> 00:28:27.860\nand then you can specify once you create\nit, you can specify all the settings.\n\n605\n00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:31.900\nThe server you connect to, your remote\nlocal IDs, your authentication settings,\n\n606\n00:28:31.900 --> 00:28:35.000\nall the different things you needed\nto do to connect to that network.\n\n607\n00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:39.550\nAnd now, your Mac can spin up an encrypted\nconnection whenever you need it, and\n\n608\n00:28:39.550 --> 00:28:43.930\nthat's kind of a nice feature to have, you\ncan whip up that connectivity in place.\n\n609\n00:28:43.930 --> 00:28:46.790\nIf you do that, I encourage you\nto use this option right here,\n\n610\n00:28:46.790 --> 00:28:48.990\nshow VPN status in menu bar.\n\n611\n00:28:48.990 --> 00:28:52.660\nAnd that way you can\nvisually look right here and\n\n612\n00:28:52.660 --> 00:28:54.520\nknow whether you're connected or not.\n\n613\n00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:56.950\nAnd if you're not connected\nyou can drop it down, and\n\n614\n00:28:56.950 --> 00:28:58.610\nyou can choose to connect to the VPN.\n\n615\n00:28:58.610 --> 00:29:00.930\nAnd this'll light up so\nyou know that you are connected,\n\n616\n00:29:00.930 --> 00:29:03.800\nand when you're disconnected it'll\nlook grey just like this one.\n\n617\n00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:08.215\nCuz there's nothing worse than\nthinking you're on a secured network\n\n618\n00:29:08.215 --> 00:29:11.405\nwhen you're actually just blasting\nstuff out unencrypted and\n\n619\n00:29:11.405 --> 00:29:14.215\nnow you're especially giving\nup your privacy, right?\n\n620\n00:29:14.215 --> 00:29:17.315\nSo we always want to make sure we\nadd that, it's definitely helpful.\n\n621\n00:29:17.315 --> 00:29:18.745\n>> Yes, it's very nice that\nwe've lived in a day and\n\n622\n00:29:18.745 --> 00:29:22.875\nage where all, all of these software,\nour operating system vendors out there\n\n623\n00:29:22.875 --> 00:29:24.400\nhave realized that\n>> Listen,\n\n624\n00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:26.350\nwe've got to put some sort\nof firewall on there, and\n\n625\n00:29:26.350 --> 00:29:32.280\nsince VPN connections are very very common\nas well, we have to add that support also.\n\n626\n00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:34.280\nDon, we've,\nI think we've actually done it,\n\n627\n00:29:34.280 --> 00:29:38.280\nwe might have actually [LAUGH] covered\nall the security topics for this episode.\n\n628\n00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:40.300\nHave we missed anything, or do you\nhave any parting words of wisdom for\n\n629\n00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:41.240\nour good viewers?\n\n630\n00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:45.210\nYou know, a lot of these features are\nreally good features, a lot of them were\n\n631\n00:29:45.210 --> 00:29:49.370\nturned off by default and\na lot of users don't even know they exist.\n\n632\n00:29:49.370 --> 00:29:52.190\nSo, if you go through and turn on every\none of them, you're gonna be very secure\n\n633\n00:29:52.190 --> 00:29:55.320\nbut like Daniel said, your system\nbecomes a little less convenient to use.\n\n634\n00:29:55.320 --> 00:29:58.850\nSo you've got to find that perfect\nbalance, which of the features that I can\n\n635\n00:29:58.850 --> 00:30:03.390\nturn on and gain the benefit from and\nnot inconvenience my users.\n\n636\n00:30:03.390 --> 00:30:04.780\nTurning on FileVault and\n\n637\n00:30:04.780 --> 00:30:09.450\nturning on the firmware password, your end\nuser won't even know it's there, right?\n\n638\n00:30:09.450 --> 00:30:10.450\nOnly people who try and\n\n639\n00:30:10.450 --> 00:30:13.830\nbypass it will know it's there,\nso definitely turn those on.\n\n640\n00:30:13.830 --> 00:30:16.650\nTurning on the firewall,\nthat might break some software,\n\n641\n00:30:16.650 --> 00:30:19.370\nwe might have to fidget with it\na bit to get it set kind of right.\n\n642\n00:30:19.370 --> 00:30:22.180\nAnd that can be a challenge,\nwe might not want to go that route.\n\n643\n00:30:22.180 --> 00:30:25.210\nInstalling antivirus,\nthat can slow your system down, but\n\n644\n00:30:25.210 --> 00:30:28.380\nthe trade-off might be worth it if you\nwant that extra level of protection.\n\n645\n00:30:28.380 --> 00:30:29.910\nIt's up to you to figure\nout which one's right for\n\n646\n00:30:29.910 --> 00:30:32.640\nthe exam, they just want you to\nbe aware of each of the options.\n\n647\n00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:34.360\nKnow what they are, know what they do,\n\n648\n00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:36.430\nthey're not gonna ask you to make the\njudgement call of whether it's right for\n\n649\n00:30:36.430 --> 00:30:37.800\nyour environment or not.\n\n650\n00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:39.280\n>> All right Don,\nawesome stuff, thank you so\n\n651\n00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:41.290\nmuch for stopping by and\nexplaining these concepts.\n\n652\n00:30:41.290 --> 00:30:44.680\nThese best practices and the cool features\nthat are built in to our operating\n\n653\n00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:47.760\nsystems, or maybe even third-party\nthat can help us do that.\n\n654\n00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:50.720\nAnd that being said, we're gonna wrap\nup the show, thanks for watching.\n\n655\n00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:53.370\nSigning off for ITPRO.TV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n656\n00:30:53.370 --> 00:30:54.190\n>> And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n657\n00:30:54.190 --> 00:30:56.048\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n658\n00:30:56.048 --> 00:31:02.680\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.581 --> 00:00:18.090\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n4\n00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.236\nAnd in today's episode,\n\n5\n00:00:19.236 --> 00:00:22.049\nwe are moving forward with our\nMac Integration Basics Series and\n\n6\n00:00:22.049 --> 00:00:23.314\nI did get it right this time.\n\n7\n00:00:23.314 --> 00:00:24.096\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n8\n00:00:24.096 --> 00:00:27.486\njoining us back in the studio again today\nto help us in that very endeavor is our\n\n9\n00:00:27.486 --> 00:00:29.532\ngood friend, our mentor, our guiding star.\n\n10\n00:00:29.532 --> 00:00:32.098\nThat is Mr. Don Pezet,\nI'm building up your mythos.\n\n11\n00:00:32.098 --> 00:00:33.914\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I know, it's starting to get creepy.\n\n12\n00:00:33.914 --> 00:00:37.594\n[LAUGH] So thanks for having me back,\nDaniel, I do appreciate it.\n\n13\n00:00:37.594 --> 00:00:39.920\nAnd we're gonna be jumping right\nback into Mac integration basics.\n\n14\n00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.703\nIn this episode, we're gonna be taking\na look at configuring printing on our Mac.\n\n15\n00:00:44.703 --> 00:00:47.247\nIn other words, getting our Mac to play\nnice with the printers on the network.\n\n16\n00:00:47.247 --> 00:00:52.010\nAnd hey, if you guys are anything like me,\nthen boy did you hate trees, right?\n\n17\n00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.494\nSo, if you have all this nice digital and\nenvironmentally friendly data,\n\n18\n00:00:55.494 --> 00:00:56.889\nwe gonna get that onto a tree.\n\n19\n00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:58.329\nSomehow, we gotta do it fast.\n\n20\n00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:01.863\nNow, I know it is somebody who's\nworking in help desk positions and\n\n21\n00:01:01.863 --> 00:01:04.170\nsupport positions over the years.\n\n22\n00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.430\nThat, for an end user,\n\n23\n00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.510\nthere is no travesty bigger\nthan their printer not working.\n\n24\n00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:10.300\nWe get this a lot.\n\n25\n00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.290\nPeople still need things on paper and\neven me.\n\n26\n00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.010\nI joke around about it but\nwhat do I have right here?\n\n27\n00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:16.250\nI got my paper show notes.\n\n28\n00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.450\nSo, people still need things on paper.\n\n29\n00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.090\nAnd so, when you've got a Mac\nfired up on your network,\n\n30\n00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.080\nthe odds are you're\ngoing to need to print.\n\n31\n00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.020\nNow, fortunately there are a number\nof different ways that\n\n32\n00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.790\nwe can set that up inside of Mac OS, and\nwe're gonna see some of them right here.\n\n33\n00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:37.930\nFirst one I wanna mention is probably\nthe most simple, and goes without saying.\n\n34\n00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.660\nIf you've got a printer,\nhonestly, it's got a cable and\n\n35\n00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:45.020\nyou plug it in to your computer and\nyou're probably done, right?\n\n36\n00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.790\nMost printers these days\nship with a USB cable and\n\n37\n00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.820\nthen plug it right in to\na USB port on your computer.\n\n38\n00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.250\nAnd Apple devices will just automatically\ndetect them, set them up and off you go.\n\n39\n00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.620\nApple is really good about building\nprinter drivers into their system, so\n\n40\n00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:02.710\nthat they just work,\nwe don't have to worry about it, right?\n\n41\n00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.900\nBut if you're gonna plugin that way,\nhere's a few things to remember.\n\n42\n00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.650\nFirst off, when you plug a printer\ndirectly into your device,\n\n43\n00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:12.000\nthat means you're going to use it.\n\n44\n00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.920\nFor a lot of times with the device\nbe shared amongst other people,\n\n45\n00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.800\nthen plugging it directly into your\ncomputer's not the best way to do it.\n\n46\n00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.100\nSo we're normally gonna\nhave a plug into a network.\n\n47\n00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.820\nAnd I'm gonna talk about the networking\nside of things here in a little bit.\n\n48\n00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.520\nBut let's stick with\nthis kind of local side.\n\n49\n00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.340\nYou plug it in locally into your computer.\n\n50\n00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.880\nWell, I said Apple did a really good\njob of including printer drivers.\n\n51\n00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.020\nThey did, but\nthey can't include drivers for everything.\n\n52\n00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.150\nNew printers come out all the time and\nsometimes things are missing.\n\n53\n00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.720\nSo if you're going to be\nconnecting a printer.\n\n54\n00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.170\nBefore you plug it in,\nyou might wanna check and\n\n55\n00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.730\nsee if you need to download drivers.\n\n56\n00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.480\nAnd you can go ahead and plug it in,\njust see if it works, right?\n\n57\n00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.081\nNine times out of ten it will and\nyou're done.\n\n58\n00:02:49.081 --> 00:02:51.000\nThat was the simplest\nyou were gonna do today.\n\n59\n00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.588\nBut if you need a driver, you're gonna\nhave to jump to the vendor website.\n\n60\n00:02:54.588 --> 00:02:56.610\nAnd so,\nlet me just show you an example of that.\n\n61\n00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:02.280\nSo I've got a printer here in the studio,\nit's a HP Laser Jet M400 or\n\n62\n00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.440\nsomething along those lines.\n\n63\n00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.160\nAnd if I wanna connect to that thing,\nI might need to go out and\n\n64\n00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.940\ndownload a driver for it.\n\n65\n00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.140\nSo I'm gonna jump over to\nHPs website which apparently\n\n66\n00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.010\nhas gone international on me.\n\n67\n00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:16.860\nSo where's the United States in this mess?\n\n68\n00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.135\nGot the Americas.\n\n69\n00:03:19.135 --> 00:03:21.150\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> This is the hardest part.\n\n70\n00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:22.900\nYou gotta find your country.\n\n71\n00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.120\nAnd there we go.\n\n72\n00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.889\nAnd so, I can come in here.\n\n73\n00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:27.872\nAnd I can type LaserJet M400.\n\n74\n00:03:27.872 --> 00:03:31.861\nI believe, it's actually an M400 dne,\nif I remember right.\n\n75\n00:03:31.861 --> 00:03:33.603\nBut that's not showing up, is it?\n\n76\n00:03:33.603 --> 00:03:37.590\nLet me jump over to a machine that's\nalready got it like this Windows machine.\n\n77\n00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.370\nAnd we're gonna see this a little bit\nlater in the episode too is that, you can\n\n78\n00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.040\nhave the printer set up on a Windows\nmachine, still connect to it from you Mac.\n\n79\n00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.103\nWe've got that flexibility.\n\n80\n00:03:46.103 --> 00:03:49.540\nSo there's a lot of\ndifferent things we can do.\n\n81\n00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.199\nIt's actually an M401dne.\n\n82\n00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:57.760\nSo let me just jump right back\nover here and we'll do an M401dne.\n\n83\n00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:58.970\nThere we go.\n\n84\n00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:01.030\nAll right, it helps if you\nget the right model number.\n\n85\n00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.786\nSo I'm gonna punch that in and it's\ngonna take me into HPs support page for\n\n86\n00:04:04.786 --> 00:04:05.586\nthis printer.\n\n87\n00:04:05.586 --> 00:04:08.105\nNow you probably have a different printer,\nright?\n\n88\n00:04:08.105 --> 00:04:09.710\nSo you wanna look up yours.\n\n89\n00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:13.390\nBut once you get in there, you're gonna\nstart seeing things like Download options.\n\n90\n00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:16.570\nNow, if you're coming from the Windows\nworld you're pretty used to this.\n\n91\n00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:20.460\nOn the Windows side, we almost always have\nto download drivers and install them.\n\n92\n00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:24.390\nBut on the Apple side, you don't, a lot\nof times the drivers are already there.\n\n93\n00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:28.860\nSo, when I browse into the driver section\nhere, I may not find any Apple drivers,\n\n94\n00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:30.540\nthat's very, very possible.\n\n95\n00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:34.560\nSo, we'll just have to see, this is\npart of the whole checking process.\n\n96\n00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.000\nSo it's asking me right here,\nwhat operating system am I running?\n\n97\n00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.200\nAnd I'm gonna drop that down and\nthere's old El Capitan right there,\n\n98\n00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:45.250\nOS 10, 10.11 and so I'll choose it.\n\n99\n00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:47.850\nAnd now that I've got it selected, well,\n\n100\n00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:50.900\nactually there is a driver available for\nit.\n\n101\n00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:51.970\nBut it's not a real driver.\n\n102\n00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:53.140\nIt's HP Easy Start.\n\n103\n00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:54.930\nOkay, what is HP Easy Start?\n\n104\n00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:55.935\nIt's just a little wizard,\n\n105\n00:04:55.935 --> 00:04:58.960\nthat you can run that will find the\nprinter on the network and get it set up.\n\n106\n00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.310\nIt's not actually a driver.\n\n107\n00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:02.920\nSo, that means we don't need a driver.\n\n108\n00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:06.310\nSometimes, you'll choose, this has\nactually PKG package files so, you can use\n\n109\n00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:09.420\nall the half of the driver for the\nprinter, in this case, I don't need one.\n\n110\n00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:12.140\nBut, this is really the first place we\nneed to start is the vendor's website,\n\n111\n00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:14.970\ngo to the website,\nsee whether you need to load a driver.\n\n112\n00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:18.420\nIf you do, it's always better\nto install the driver first and\n\n113\n00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:19.990\nthen plug in the printer.\n\n114\n00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:21.430\nVersus plugging in the printer first and\n\n115\n00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:23.930\ntrying to install the driver afterwards\ncuz that can cause some problems.\n\n116\n00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:27.190\nSo, that's why it's important to check for\nthis stuff, all right.\n\n117\n00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:30.770\nBut in my case, I'm covered,\nI can go ahead and get set up.\n\n118\n00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:33.570\nNow, if it's a USB printer,\n\n119\n00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:37.530\nI just plug it right into the USB port,\nmy Mac's gonna see it, and I'm done.\n\n120\n00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:40.580\nIt'll show up,\nif I go into my system preferences and\n\n121\n00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:44.110\nI go into the printing,\nright here, Printers & Scanners.\n\n122\n00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:46.420\nWe go in there, if I plug it in via USB,\n\n123\n00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:49.910\nit's just gonna show up right\nhere in the list and I'm done.\n\n124\n00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:52.230\nNow I can print to it to my\nheart's content and I'm done.\n\n125\n00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.250\nBut here's the thing about USB.\n\n126\n00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:58.370\nIf I plug it into my computer\nwith USB I can print to it.\n\n127\n00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:00.310\nWhat if I want Daniel to print to it?\n\n128\n00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:02.915\nWell, you can only plug a USB\ndevice into one system.\n\n129\n00:06:02.915 --> 00:06:04.366\nSo I could take the printer and\n\n130\n00:06:04.366 --> 00:06:08.093\nshare it on the network and he could\nconnect through my computer to get to it.\n\n131\n00:06:08.093 --> 00:06:11.030\nThat works, but\nwhat happens if I turn my computer off?\n\n132\n00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:14.090\nI've got a laptop, I take my laptop home.\n\n133\n00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:15.540\nNow Daniel can't print.\n\n134\n00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:17.840\nEverybody's relying on my computer.\n\n135\n00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:22.970\nSo, it's very uncommon these days that we\nplug a printer directly into our computer.\n\n136\n00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:27.060\nInstead, we usually plug our\nprinter into our network.\n\n137\n00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:30.350\nMost printers these days will either\nhave a physical network jack, or\n\n138\n00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:34.050\na wireless network antenna\nbuilt into the device.\n\n139\n00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:37.120\nAnd that way we can connect directly\nto the printer over the network.\n\n140\n00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:39.480\nAnd now, I can connect directly to it.\n\n141\n00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:41.000\nAnd Daniel can connect directly to it, and\n\n142\n00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.570\neverybody else in the office\ncan connect directly into it.\n\n143\n00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:47.300\nAnd I don't have to worry about, hey,\nwhat if I take my computer home, or\n\n144\n00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:49.010\nDaniel turns his laptop off?\n\n145\n00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:49.710\nIt doesn't matter.\n\n146\n00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:52.410\nEverybody else can still see the printer.\n\n147\n00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:56.460\nSo USB connectivity is there but\njust not very common.\n\n148\n00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:59.390\nNetwork connectivity is the one\nthat's really gonna be common.\n\n149\n00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:02.095\n>> Yeah, 1998 called and\nsaid they want their connection back.\n\n150\n00:07:02.095 --> 00:07:04.170\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And now we need to move in some more\n\n151\n00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:08.250\nuseful types of and net wireless if\nreally gonna be your best option.\n\n152\n00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:10.540\nBut just connecting it, I do this at home,\n\n153\n00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:14.440\nI have my router sitting on a table\nwith my cable modem and everything.\n\n154\n00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:18.260\nAnd I just plug it directly into\nthe little switch ports on the back,\n\n155\n00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:19.130\nmakes it easy.\n\n156\n00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:21.367\nBut if I don't have that option,\nI can obviously go wireless as well.\n\n157\n00:07:21.367 --> 00:07:23.562\nNetworking is the best way to connect.\n\n158\n00:07:23.562 --> 00:07:27.113\n>> Yeah, my house is not conducive\nto running cable through it and\n\n159\n00:07:27.113 --> 00:07:29.590\nso we've got a printer that's wireless.\n\n160\n00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:32.290\nAnd so it just jumps right onto the\nwireless network, we can all see it and\n\n161\n00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:33.810\nprint to it and it works really well.\n\n162\n00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:35.348\nSo those are some of\nthe options that we've got.\n\n163\n00:07:35.348 --> 00:07:38.861\nThe printer that we have here is on\nthe network, let's take a look at it and\n\n164\n00:07:38.861 --> 00:07:40.121\nsee what features it has.\n\n165\n00:07:40.121 --> 00:07:43.898\nNow, you would go to your printer,\nand you would look on the screen and\n\n166\n00:07:43.898 --> 00:07:48.140\nsee what IP address it had sitting on it,\nmine is 10.1.230.231.\n\n167\n00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:51.842\nThat's probably not the address\nthat yours is going to have,\n\n168\n00:07:51.842 --> 00:07:55.115\nbut that's the address I've\ngot in here I can see I've\n\n169\n00:07:55.115 --> 00:07:58.762\ngot this HP laser jet\n400M401dne There it is, right?\n\n170\n00:07:58.762 --> 00:08:01.872\nAnd the, apparently it's in sleep mode\nright now cuz it's sitting there idle,\n\n171\n00:08:01.872 --> 00:08:03.300\nnot really doing anything.\n\n172\n00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:06.210\nBut what I wanna look at is\nthis Networking tab right here.\n\n173\n00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:11.400\nSo I'm gonna jump on to Networking and\nhere I can see the IPv4 address and so on.\n\n174\n00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:15.370\nAnd what I'm trying to figure out is,\nis this one wired or wireless?\n\n175\n00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:17.330\nAnd, does it really matter to me?\n\n176\n00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:19.060\nActually, at the end of the day,\nit truly doesn't.\n\n177\n00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:21.800\nBecause it has an IP address, and\nthat's what I'm gonna connect to.\n\n178\n00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:25.076\nBut there are some services,\nlike AirPrint,\n\n179\n00:08:25.076 --> 00:08:29.278\nthat really rely on having\na wireless network they can see.\n\n180\n00:08:29.278 --> 00:08:31.596\nSo your iPad can come in the office, and\n\n181\n00:08:31.596 --> 00:08:35.258\nsee this special wireless network\nthat is just that printer.\n\n182\n00:08:35.258 --> 00:08:37.138\nAnd then we can print to it and\nwe get that access.\n\n183\n00:08:37.138 --> 00:08:40.118\nSo, you'll usually see Configuration\nsettings that center around that.\n\n184\n00:08:40.118 --> 00:08:44.402\nSo as I look at my settings on the left\nside, I've got my IPv4, and IPv6,\n\n185\n00:08:44.402 --> 00:08:46.578\nNetwork Identification, and so on.\n\n186\n00:08:46.578 --> 00:08:49.330\nThat's talking about my physical network,\nand then lo and behold,\n\n187\n00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:50.858\nthis one supports AirPrint, right?\n\n188\n00:08:50.858 --> 00:08:54.258\nSo it's actually got native AirPrint\nservice that's built right into it.\n\n189\n00:08:54.258 --> 00:08:57.931\nAnd if I choose that over here,\nI can see that AirPrint is on, and\n\n190\n00:08:57.931 --> 00:09:01.618\nit's identifying itself as this nice,\neasy to remember name.\n\n191\n00:09:01.618 --> 00:09:04.868\nAnd that's not necessarily the greatest\nname, because I might have two or\n\n192\n00:09:04.868 --> 00:09:06.010\nthree of these printers.\n\n193\n00:09:06.010 --> 00:09:09.005\nAnd so we might want to rename it, and\ncall it something that we can recognize.\n\n194\n00:09:09.005 --> 00:09:12.360\nSo, maybe I want to change this and,\nwhat should we call it?\n\n195\n00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:13.670\nHow about like studio printer.\n\n196\n00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:17.230\n>> Yeah, I like to be descriptive\nwith the names of location and\n\n197\n00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:20.288\nwhy it's being used or whose using it.\n\n198\n00:09:20.288 --> 00:09:22.928\nThat helps when you do see\nthese kind of things in a list.\n\n199\n00:09:22.928 --> 00:09:25.478\nThat's the studio printer for the host.\n\n200\n00:09:25.478 --> 00:09:28.458\nOr it's the, we've got editors here.\n\n201\n00:09:28.458 --> 00:09:30.420\nMaybe it's the editor printing station.\n\n202\n00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:31.730\nYeah, they wanted to print stuff out.\n\n203\n00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:33.220\nThat's what I'll typically do.\n\n204\n00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:35.382\n>> So, I'm just punching in\nsome data here to say that it\n\n205\n00:09:35.382 --> 00:09:38.000\nis the ITProTV Studio Printer,\nthat's sitting over there.\n\n206\n00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.580\nAnd it's at the Editor Station Desk.\n\n207\n00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:40.848\nThat's where it's sitting.\n\n208\n00:09:40.848 --> 00:09:41.868\nAnd it's in Gainesville, FL.\n\n209\n00:09:41.868 --> 00:09:44.430\nYou can put in latitude and longitude,\n\n210\n00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:47.540\nif you wanna really go\ncrazy with these things.\n\n211\n00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:48.460\nSo you can do that.\n\n212\n00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:50.430\nBut I'm just gonna punch it in like that.\n\n213\n00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:52.740\nAnd it's turned on, so\nI don't have to turn it on.\n\n214\n00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:56.230\nIt's already on and I can just apply that\nand that setting's gonna take effect.\n\n215\n00:09:56.230 --> 00:09:58.860\nSo now, it's got a nice little\nname that we can sorta recognize\n\n216\n00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:01.200\non the wireless side, right?\n\n217\n00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:05.158\nBut on the wired side, I've got a Network\nIdentification section here, too.\n\n218\n00:10:05.158 --> 00:10:11.138\nAnd you'll see it's got another\ngreat host name, this NPI5A93CA.\n\n219\n00:10:11.138 --> 00:10:13.018\n>> I already memorized it,\nI already memorized it.\n\n220\n00:10:13.018 --> 00:10:15.814\n>> Now that's just a host name, so there's\nonly so much that I can do with that.\n\n221\n00:10:15.814 --> 00:10:18.294\nYou can't have spaces in a host name and\nso on.\n\n222\n00:10:18.294 --> 00:10:25.674\nI might want to call this one,\nstudioprinter.studio.itpro.tv or\n\n223\n00:10:25.674 --> 00:10:28.934\nsomething like that, right?\n\n224\n00:10:28.934 --> 00:10:30.154\nYou can give it a host name.\n\n225\n00:10:30.154 --> 00:10:32.574\nI don't need all that,\nI'll just call it studioprinter.\n\n226\n00:10:32.574 --> 00:10:34.542\nThere, so that I can kinda\nrecognise what that it is.\n\n227\n00:10:34.542 --> 00:10:35.982\nI can give the domain name right here,\n\n228\n00:10:35.982 --> 00:10:37.962\nthat's why I deleted that\ndomain name out of there.\n\n229\n00:10:37.962 --> 00:10:40.910\nBut you'll see other things you\ncan specify, like DNS servers,\n\n230\n00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:42.042\nWIN servers, and so on.\n\n231\n00:10:42.042 --> 00:10:46.722\nSo we can set that however it is that\nwe need and get that put in place.\n\n232\n00:10:46.722 --> 00:10:49.790\nAnd then down here,\nthis is the important one for Apple.\n\n233\n00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:53.240\nYou've got a Bonjour Service Name and\nsee how it already grabbed the one from\n\n234\n00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:57.490\nAirPrint, so it's using that same name and\nthat's cool for me, so that works out.\n\n235\n00:10:57.490 --> 00:10:58.610\nAll right so, so\n\n236\n00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:01.510\nnow we've got that stuff kinda in place,\nso I'll go ahead and hit Apply.\n\n237\n00:11:02.810 --> 00:11:03.610\nAnd there we go.\n\n238\n00:11:03.610 --> 00:11:06.780\nIt's warning me if I change my IP\naddress I might lock myself out but\n\n239\n00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:07.280\nI didn't do that.\n\n240\n00:11:08.512 --> 00:11:12.440\nAll right, so once that's turned on,\nhow do I connect to this printer?\n\n241\n00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:15.750\nWell, there's actually several different\nways I can get connected to it.\n\n242\n00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:20.550\nThe easiest way is, I can connect\nto it right over the network and\n\n243\n00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:21.710\nestablish a connection.\n\n244\n00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:26.440\nIt's running Bonjour and so I should be\nable to discover it and find it, right?\n\n245\n00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:28.540\nWell, sometimes yes, sometimes no.\n\n246\n00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:29.840\nLet me show you what I mean.\n\n247\n00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:31.820\nWhen I want to browse and\nfind that printer, right?\n\n248\n00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:34.700\nSo I come in here and\nI look at my printers.\n\n249\n00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:36.510\nAnd it says, No printers are available.\n\n250\n00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:37.840\nClick Add to set one up.\n\n251\n00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:39.280\nSo I'll click add.\n\n252\n00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:41.951\nAnd when I go to add one,\nit's gonna scan the network and try and\n\n253\n00:11:41.951 --> 00:11:43.829\nfind people that are out there, all right?\n\n254\n00:11:43.829 --> 00:11:45.550\nAnd did it find anybody?\n\n255\n00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:46.440\nSure enough, it did.\n\n256\n00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:48.410\nIt found them right there.\n\n257\n00:11:48.410 --> 00:11:52.460\nHopefully, you discover the printer, but\n\n258\n00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:56.830\nprotocols like Bonjour don't like to pass\nthrough routers and firewalls, right?\n\n259\n00:11:56.830 --> 00:11:59.570\nThey're not routable,\nthey stay on their own local network.\n\n260\n00:11:59.570 --> 00:12:02.550\nSo if the printer is on\na different network than I am,\n\n261\n00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:05.070\nI might have to add it by hand, okay?\n\n262\n00:12:05.070 --> 00:12:07.500\nSo if it finds it automatically,\nthat's great.\n\n263\n00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:09.260\nAnd see how it says, Use AirPrint.\n\n264\n00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:11.880\nSo it found it and it's going to\nuse AirPrint to reach out to it.\n\n265\n00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:15.272\nAnd it's all automatic,\nI don't have to mess with anything.\n\n266\n00:12:15.272 --> 00:12:18.950\nI can hit Add and now I'm going to\nhave the ITProTV Studio Printer.\n\n267\n00:12:18.950 --> 00:12:22.730\nAnd I'm just gonna add to the end of\nthe name that this one is AirPrint, right?\n\n268\n00:12:22.730 --> 00:12:24.900\nSo that that we, we learn to this one.\n\n269\n00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:27.210\nAnd I'll add it into the system.\n\n270\n00:12:27.210 --> 00:12:29.000\nNow, it says setting up the device.\n\n271\n00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.130\nWhat does that mean?\n\n272\n00:12:30.130 --> 00:12:31.398\nIt's loading the driver.\n\n273\n00:12:31.398 --> 00:12:33.138\nI didn't have to go and\ndownload the driver.\n\n274\n00:12:33.138 --> 00:12:35.658\nApple's already taken care that for me.\n\n275\n00:12:35.658 --> 00:12:37.271\nSo, it is gonna set it up and\n\n276\n00:12:37.271 --> 00:12:40.960\nI'm now going to have this printer\nthat I found via AirPrint.\n\n277\n00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:43.720\nSuper simple, super easy, all right?\n\n278\n00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:45.770\nBut if I couldn't find the printer,\n\n279\n00:12:45.770 --> 00:12:48.270\nI'm gonna have to tell our\nsystem how to find it.\n\n280\n00:12:48.270 --> 00:12:50.180\nSo if it's on a different network,\nfor example.\n\n281\n00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:53.200\nSo I'll need to tell it the IP\naddress of the printer so\n\n282\n00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:54.470\nthat it'll be able to find it.\n\n283\n00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:59.950\nSo as soon as this is done,\nnotice how I've got this IP tab up here?\n\n284\n00:12:59.950 --> 00:13:04.640\nAnd I can chose that and\nI can add a printer in by its IP address.\n\n285\n00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:07.000\nAnd that way,\neven if it's on a different network,\n\n286\n00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.390\nI'll be able to pass through a router to\nget to it and still be able to print.\n\n287\n00:13:10.390 --> 00:13:12.140\nAnd so I'll do that here in just a moment.\n\n288\n00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:15.800\nNow, my setting up is\ntaking a nice long time.\n\n289\n00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:18.680\nSo we'll have to give that a second.\n\n290\n00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:22.270\nThere are times where the driver\nis supported by Apple but\n\n291\n00:13:22.270 --> 00:13:23.580\nnot on your own machine.\n\n292\n00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:26.270\nAnd your machine might have to\nreach out to Apple to download it.\n\n293\n00:13:26.270 --> 00:13:26.950\nOr even reach out to\n\n294\n00:13:26.950 --> 00:13:29.740\nthe vendor in some scenarios if\nthey've digitally signed with Apple.\n\n295\n00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:32.050\nSo mine maybe doing that\ndownload right now.\n\n296\n00:13:33.410 --> 00:13:36.708\nOr it's just deciding to test my patience,\nwhich is pretty common too.\n\n297\n00:13:36.708 --> 00:13:41.308\n>> Now, Don, could we, maybe we realize,\nmaybe we've got a more obscure printer.\n\n298\n00:13:41.308 --> 00:13:45.212\nWould it be beneficial to us, maybe even\nto just start like we did with our USB\n\n299\n00:13:45.212 --> 00:13:49.116\nwhere we went out to the vendor and\njust made sure there wasn't a download for\n\n300\n00:13:49.116 --> 00:13:51.438\nthe driver,\njust kinda beat it to the punch.\n\n301\n00:13:51.438 --> 00:13:53.953\nCuz like you said,\nthey try to put as much as they can and\n\n302\n00:13:53.953 --> 00:13:56.965\nnot everything is supported, so\nthere's just maybe like in this\n\n303\n00:13:56.965 --> 00:14:01.000\ninstance you just want to jump out to the\nvendor, grab that driver and install it.\n\n304\n00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:01.850\nKinda speed things up.\n\n305\n00:14:01.850 --> 00:14:02.780\n>> Yeah, you can certainly do that.\n\n306\n00:14:02.780 --> 00:14:05.550\nIf you're using AirPrint, you shouldn't\nhave to do it cuz that's kinda got it's\n\n307\n00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:08.300\nown standard language but\nif you're doing a direct connection, yeah,\n\n308\n00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:10.190\nit's a good idea to go out there and\nget it.\n\n309\n00:14:10.190 --> 00:14:11.760\nWell, I'll tell you what,\nwhile we're waiting on that,\n\n310\n00:14:12.830 --> 00:14:16.420\nwe've seen the AirPrint which uses Bonjour\nto find the printer, it was super easy.\n\n311\n00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:19.638\nI'm about to show you the IP connectivity\nas soon as this thing gets done.\n\n312\n00:14:19.638 --> 00:14:23.839\nAnd then the third thing is, if there's\nalready another computer on the network\n\n313\n00:14:23.839 --> 00:14:27.498\nset up to use it, we can just connect\nto their shared printer, right?\n\n314\n00:14:27.498 --> 00:14:29.670\nAnd I've already said\nthe negative of that,\n\n315\n00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:33.097\nlike if Daniel is already connected\nto the printer, and he shares it for\n\n316\n00:14:33.097 --> 00:14:36.430\nme, I can just connect to his printer and\nthat's it, right?\n\n317\n00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:38.740\nBut if he turns his computer off,\nthen I've got a problem.\n\n318\n00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:40.053\nWell, it's not ideal, but\n\n319\n00:14:40.053 --> 00:14:43.618\nthere are situations where that's\nstill something that's valuable to us.\n\n320\n00:14:43.618 --> 00:14:46.660\nSo for example, you might have\na Windows print server set up, and\n\n321\n00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:48.998\nthere's a number of different reasons for\nthat.\n\n322\n00:14:48.998 --> 00:14:52.420\nWe can actually use a shared printer\nfrom a Windows machine on our Mac,\n\n323\n00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:54.398\nthey're compatible, they'll talk.\n\n324\n00:14:54.398 --> 00:14:58.206\nMac support SMB which is server message\nblock and we normally use that for\n\n325\n00:14:58.206 --> 00:14:59.420\nfile transfers.\n\n326\n00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:02.570\nIf you watched our file sharing episode,\nwe talked about SMB a good bit there.\n\n327\n00:15:02.570 --> 00:15:06.738\nAnd I always talked about it in terms of\nfolders but it can share printers also.\n\n328\n00:15:06.738 --> 00:15:08.558\nAnd so I can connect to a Windows machine.\n\n329\n00:15:08.558 --> 00:15:11.550\nNow the Windows machine does\nnot have the driver for me.\n\n330\n00:15:11.550 --> 00:15:15.650\nIt's got the Windows driver, not the Apple\ndriver but we can get it if we need it and\n\n331\n00:15:15.650 --> 00:15:16.790\nhave that support.\n\n332\n00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:20.650\nSo in the background here I've\ngot a Windows machine somewhere.\n\n333\n00:15:20.650 --> 00:15:21.468\nHere we go.\n\n334\n00:15:21.468 --> 00:15:27.011\nAnd on this Windows machine I've\nconfigured that HP Laserjet M401dne and\n\n335\n00:15:27.011 --> 00:15:28.896\nshared it on the network.\n\n336\n00:15:28.896 --> 00:15:32.813\nSo it's being shared from that\nWindows machine on the network so\n\n337\n00:15:32.813 --> 00:15:36.816\nthat other devices can see it and\nconnect and find it, all right?\n\n338\n00:15:36.816 --> 00:15:41.180\nWell, way over here my work station\ndoesn't necessarily know about that, yet.\n\n339\n00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:43.340\nSo if I want to connect to it,\nI'm gonna have to tell it.\n\n340\n00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:48.490\nAnd if you look right up here,\nI've got Default, IP and Windows.\n\n341\n00:15:48.490 --> 00:15:51.592\nAnd we can use that Windows tab to connect\nto a Windows printer share that's out\n\n342\n00:15:51.592 --> 00:15:54.318\nthere on the network and reach out and\nget connected to it and have it.\n\n343\n00:15:54.318 --> 00:15:57.615\nSo, we can integrate with Windows,\nwhich is what this series is all about,\n\n344\n00:15:57.615 --> 00:15:59.995\nif you've already have got\nthose printers out there.\n\n345\n00:15:59.995 --> 00:16:01.376\nBut ideally, you won't.\n\n346\n00:16:01.376 --> 00:16:03.751\nIdeally, you'll connect\ndirectly to the printer, so\n\n347\n00:16:03.751 --> 00:16:05.223\nyou don't have to worry about it.\n\n348\n00:16:05.223 --> 00:16:08.720\nBut let's say your printer\ndoesn't support Airplay.\n\n349\n00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:12.180\nWell, it very well may support SNB.\n\n350\n00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:14.260\nAnd so, now you can connect to it and\nbrowse that way.\n\n351\n00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:17.800\nI didn't notice on this printer,\nlet me get back to that printer screen.\n\n352\n00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:19.520\nI didn't notice whether or\nnot it supported SMB.\n\n353\n00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:20.710\nIs that gonna stay up on me?\n\n354\n00:16:20.710 --> 00:16:23.360\nLet me just bump that out of the way.\n\n355\n00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:25.950\nAnd we'll browse back\nto that printer page.\n\n356\n00:16:25.950 --> 00:16:29.210\nSo, in the Windows world, they just\nuse SNB for all these communications.\n\n357\n00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:32.990\nSometimes it'll be called NetBIOS,\nit's basically the same thing.\n\n358\n00:16:32.990 --> 00:16:36.420\nThere is a difference, but\nfor what we need it's simple.\n\n359\n00:16:36.420 --> 00:16:39.840\nBut if I go under Networking here, I can\nstart to see some basic information on it.\n\n360\n00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:42.910\nAnd sometimes it will be very obvious\nabout whether or not they support it.\n\n361\n00:16:42.910 --> 00:16:44.210\nSometimes they won't.\n\n362\n00:16:44.210 --> 00:16:49.187\nLooking at this one,\nlet's just look down the list here.\n\n363\n00:16:49.187 --> 00:16:52.550\nUnless they're using some kind of\nproprietary name, I'm not seeing it.\n\n364\n00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:54.756\nNotice how I've got\nBonjour which is enabled?\n\n365\n00:16:54.756 --> 00:16:56.300\nThat's what Apple's using.\n\n366\n00:16:56.300 --> 00:17:00.610\nWe've got the Internet Print Protocol\nwhich Windows, Mac and Linux UNIX can use.\n\n367\n00:17:00.610 --> 00:17:02.072\nSo, that's another one, and it's enabled.\n\n368\n00:17:02.072 --> 00:17:07.550\nWS-Discovery, WS-Print,\nI wonder if that's Windows Sharing?\n\n369\n00:17:07.550 --> 00:17:09.100\nThat might be their name for it.\n\n370\n00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:12.230\nI don't know if they've given\nit a different name or not.\n\n371\n00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:13.930\nSo, it more than likely has that.\n\n372\n00:17:13.930 --> 00:17:14.770\nAnd all these are enabled.\n\n373\n00:17:14.770 --> 00:17:17.820\nYou'll see all the different\nways that we can connect to it.\n\n374\n00:17:17.820 --> 00:17:20.250\nLPD, the line printer daemon.\n\n375\n00:17:20.250 --> 00:17:23.980\nFTP printing which is not\nreally used very much anymore.\n\n376\n00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:26.900\nSo, all of these are different ways\nthat we can connect to the printer.\n\n377\n00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:29.570\nAnd your Mac, it supports several of them,\n\n378\n00:17:29.570 --> 00:17:31.440\nyou just have to find\nthe one that works for you.\n\n379\n00:17:32.970 --> 00:17:34.450\nAll right, well,\nwe get to watch me try and\n\n380\n00:17:34.450 --> 00:17:36.970\nbe patient which I'm not,\nwell, here we go, we're good.\n\n381\n00:17:36.970 --> 00:17:38.210\nSo, it just added it.\n\n382\n00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:39.810\nFor whatever reason that one took forever.\n\n383\n00:17:39.810 --> 00:17:42.530\nSo, I've got my ITProTV studio\nprinter right here, and\n\n384\n00:17:42.530 --> 00:17:45.280\nit's showing us the one I\nadded via AirPrint, right?\n\n385\n00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:46.480\nSo, I've got that.\n\n386\n00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:47.140\nSuper easy.\n\n387\n00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:48.650\nI've got the printer, we're in business.\n\n388\n00:17:48.650 --> 00:17:51.230\n>> Lovely graphic, even, so you can\nmake sure you get the right printer.\n\n389\n00:17:51.230 --> 00:17:53.749\n>> That's exactly what\nthe printer looks like, too.\n\n390\n00:17:53.749 --> 00:17:56.300\nSo, it got the image of that printer,\nwhich is cool.\n\n391\n00:17:56.300 --> 00:17:59.430\nNow, let's say that I got impatient and\nI was tired of waiting for\n\n392\n00:17:59.430 --> 00:18:01.020\nthat thing, which I technically was.\n\n393\n00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:05.067\nSo, at that point what I could have done\nis said, forget it, Bonjour, let's go and\n\n394\n00:18:05.067 --> 00:18:06.440\nreach out directly with IP.\n\n395\n00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:11.740\nBonjour doesn't like to pass through\nrouters, direct IP communications can.\n\n396\n00:18:11.740 --> 00:18:14.750\nSo, when I go to hit that\nlittle add button, and\n\n397\n00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:16.320\nI jump in the little printer wizard here.\n\n398\n00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:18.380\nIt's showing me these\nBonjour discovered printers,\n\n399\n00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:20.150\nthese things that it found on the network.\n\n400\n00:18:20.150 --> 00:18:22.240\nBut I can switch over to IP, and\n\n401\n00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:26.150\nI can just tell it the IP address of\nthe printer that I want to connect to.\n\n402\n00:18:26.150 --> 00:18:29.485\nAnd so, I can punch in the IP\naddress of that printer, and\n\n403\n00:18:29.485 --> 00:18:32.070\nit's reaching out on the network.\n\n404\n00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:35.520\nIt immediately started doing this\ngathering printer information.\n\n405\n00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:38.780\nAnd it's learned all that, and\nall I did was type in an address, right?\n\n406\n00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:41.490\nSo, it's trying to figure out\nwhat kind of printer that is.\n\n407\n00:18:41.490 --> 00:18:44.600\nAnd right here, I can see\nthe protocols that are supported.\n\n408\n00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:46.660\nIPP is supported.\n\n409\n00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:51.370\nThere's LPD and\nthe HP Jetdirect Socket communications.\n\n410\n00:18:51.370 --> 00:18:53.050\nAnd it's using IPP by default.\n\n411\n00:18:53.050 --> 00:18:53.590\nAnd that's fine,\n\n412\n00:18:53.590 --> 00:18:57.220\ncuz you guys saw when I was on the printer\nscreen, it supported IPP, also.\n\n413\n00:18:57.220 --> 00:19:00.315\nYou've gotta find a protocol that's\ncompatible with both your systems that\n\n414\n00:19:00.315 --> 00:19:01.753\nworks on the printer and on the Mac.\n\n415\n00:19:01.753 --> 00:19:04.210\nAnd these are the three here\nthat are kinda on the Mac side.\n\n416\n00:19:04.210 --> 00:19:06.360\nThere are technically four\nif you count AirPrint.\n\n417\n00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:07.880\nAll right, so I'll leave it at IPP.\n\n418\n00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:09.940\nIt found it,\nit did that just happy enough.\n\n419\n00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:11.160\nSo, I'm gonna leave that be.\n\n420\n00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:14.705\nBut it gave it a name of 10.1.230.231.\n\n421\n00:19:14.705 --> 00:19:15.773\nI don't like that one so much.\n\n422\n00:19:15.773 --> 00:19:17.510\nWho is the other one named?\n\n423\n00:19:17.510 --> 00:19:19.950\nI've already forgotten what\nthe other one was named.\n\n424\n00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:20.728\n>> Studio Printer?\n\n425\n00:19:20.728 --> 00:19:22.150\n>> Something like that.\nSo, I'm gonna add that in.\n\n426\n00:19:22.150 --> 00:19:26.633\nI think we called it, or\nit was HP Laserjet M400.\n\n427\n00:19:26.633 --> 00:19:28.291\n>> Yeah.\n>> M401 DNE.\n\n428\n00:19:28.291 --> 00:19:29.370\nSome mess like that.\n\n429\n00:19:29.370 --> 00:19:31.570\nAnyhow, I'm just gonna put Studio Printer.\n\n430\n00:19:31.570 --> 00:19:33.250\nAnd I'm gonna put IP at the end so\n\n431\n00:19:33.250 --> 00:19:37.190\nI can remember that this is the one that\nI added via direct IP address, right?\n\n432\n00:19:37.190 --> 00:19:40.420\nAnd I'll go ahead and hit Add, and that\none's gonna get thrown into my list, too.\n\n433\n00:19:40.420 --> 00:19:43.810\nAnd hopefully,\nit won't take as long as the last one did.\n\n434\n00:19:43.810 --> 00:19:44.630\nSo, there it goes.\n\n435\n00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:46.100\nSee how it says finding software,\n\n436\n00:19:46.100 --> 00:19:48.490\ndownloading printer software update,\nright?\n\n437\n00:19:48.490 --> 00:19:51.360\nSo, it's having to update to be able\nto communicate directly via IP.\n\n438\n00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:54.548\nAnd this is probably what\nthe other one was doing, too.\n\n439\n00:19:54.548 --> 00:19:56.950\nIt just took a long time and\ndidn't give me a little bar to watch and\n\n440\n00:19:56.950 --> 00:19:57.820\nbe bored with.\n\n441\n00:19:57.820 --> 00:19:58.550\nAll right.\n\n442\n00:19:58.550 --> 00:20:01.290\nNow, let's say that I didn't\nhave this option either.\n\n443\n00:20:01.290 --> 00:20:03.930\nI could still go the Windows route and\n\n444\n00:20:03.930 --> 00:20:06.250\nconnect to a Windows\nprinter on the network.\n\n445\n00:20:06.250 --> 00:20:09.740\nIf there's an SNB share setup for\na printer, then we could do it.\n\n446\n00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:11.880\nAnd Windows actually\nsets those up by default.\n\n447\n00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:13.900\nWhen you stick a printer onto\na computer in Windows and\n\n448\n00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:16.260\nrun through its little wizard,\nthe little check box for\n\n449\n00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:18.260\nshare this printer on the network\nis checked by default.\n\n450\n00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:21.610\nSo, it's not a hard thing to\nset up on the Windows side.\n\n451\n00:20:21.610 --> 00:20:24.500\nBut getting connected it here,\nwe just have to tell it to do it.\n\n452\n00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:28.330\nit's kind of our last ditch effort because\nyou don't want to be reliant on another\n\n453\n00:20:28.330 --> 00:20:29.420\ncomputer when you print.\n\n454\n00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:31.570\nYou want it to just be able to go\nstraight to the printer if you can.\n\n455\n00:20:31.570 --> 00:20:33.600\nSo for me, it's my last ditch,\nit's the last thing that I do.\n\n456\n00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:37.260\n>> Yeah, it's the whole idea\nof this is a print server,\n\n457\n00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:41.450\nand servers aren't really intended to be\noffline for any given length of time.\n\n458\n00:20:41.450 --> 00:20:44.330\nAnd if you're relying on somebody's\nlaptop or their desktop, which\n\n459\n00:20:44.330 --> 00:20:48.740\nthey probably turn off on a daily basis or\nit's disconnected from you, it's not\n\n460\n00:20:48.740 --> 00:20:52.840\nreally doing the job of a server per se,\neven though we're using it in that way.\n\n461\n00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:56.420\nSo, it's not really the best way to go,\nbut in a pinch it will work.\n\n462\n00:20:56.420 --> 00:20:57.190\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n463\n00:20:57.190 --> 00:21:00.230\nAnd my desktop at home,\nI never turn the thing off.\n\n464\n00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:02.240\nIt's on all the time.\n\n465\n00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:04.330\nSo, I can set it up that way,\nthat'd be fine.\n\n466\n00:21:04.330 --> 00:21:07.520\nBut maybe there's a power outage one day,\nand my desktop doesn't boot back up, but\n\n467\n00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:08.500\nthe printer does.\n\n468\n00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:10.620\nIt's not available on the network,\nso wireless is nice.\n\n469\n00:21:10.620 --> 00:21:14.930\nWireless is also nice, not just wireless,\nbut things like AirPrint are nice,\n\n470\n00:21:14.930 --> 00:21:17.570\nbecause you can use your iPad and\niPhone to print, too.\n\n471\n00:21:17.570 --> 00:21:20.341\nSo, there's been many times where\nI had a photo on my phone and\n\n472\n00:21:20.341 --> 00:21:22.590\nI just wanted to to print\na copy of it really quick.\n\n473\n00:21:22.590 --> 00:21:24.855\nAnd so,\nyou can do it directly to the printer.\n\n474\n00:21:24.855 --> 00:21:29.990\nAnd this one's gonna take awhile, too, so\nwe get our double exercise in patience.\n\n475\n00:21:29.990 --> 00:21:32.760\nI do want to show you guys the Windows\nside cuz on the exam they're\n\n476\n00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:34.850\nreally gonna hit you on\nthe three main ones.\n\n477\n00:21:34.850 --> 00:21:38.790\nThe exam doesn't really hit on connecting\nto a printer on a Mac because that\n\n478\n00:21:38.790 --> 00:21:39.480\njust works, right?\n\n479\n00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:40.160\nThat's easy.\n\n480\n00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:43.860\nSo, they want you to know that\nyou can use AirPrint in Bonjour.\n\n481\n00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:46.240\nYou can use direct IP and\nyou can use Windows.\n\n482\n00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:47.810\nAnd, it's just finished, all right.\n\n483\n00:21:47.810 --> 00:21:50.770\nSo, there's my studio printer\nthat I set up with IP.\n\n484\n00:21:50.770 --> 00:21:52.820\nThe other one, yeah,\nit does have a different name, doesn't it?\n\n485\n00:21:52.820 --> 00:21:54.420\nShoot, well, whatever.\n\n486\n00:21:54.420 --> 00:21:57.670\nSo, I'll rename it, I wanna be consistent.\n\n487\n00:21:57.670 --> 00:22:02.760\nSo, this would be my studio\nprinter via AirPrint, right?\n\n488\n00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:06.170\nSame printer, just a different protocol\nand method for connecting to it.\n\n489\n00:22:06.170 --> 00:22:07.130\nBut there we go.\n\n490\n00:22:07.130 --> 00:22:08.600\nThe third one I'm gonna\nadd is with Windows.\n\n491\n00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:10.857\nSo, I'm just gonna go right\nback into my little Add button,\n\n492\n00:22:10.857 --> 00:22:12.080\nand I'm gonna choose Windows.\n\n493\n00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:15.660\nAnd it immediately starts scanning\nthe network for Windows computers.\n\n494\n00:22:15.660 --> 00:22:17.630\nAnd Windows computers create\na workgroup by default.\n\n495\n00:22:17.630 --> 00:22:20.250\nSo, I see a workgroup here, but you might\nhave something like an active directory\n\n496\n00:22:20.250 --> 00:22:22.530\ndomain and the domain would show up here.\n\n497\n00:22:22.530 --> 00:22:24.640\nAnd then, inside of that workgroup,\n\n498\n00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:27.360\nyou'll see computers that\nare sharing out a printer.\n\n499\n00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:31.420\nNow, I don't see mine, so that's\na little bit of a problem, isn't it?\n\n500\n00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:34.890\nSo, for some reason, I'm not seeing that\nWindows machine that's on the network,\n\n501\n00:22:34.890 --> 00:22:36.480\nand there's a few things\nthat could cause that.\n\n502\n00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:40.110\nFirst off, I need to be on that\nnetwork to be able to see it.\n\n503\n00:22:40.110 --> 00:22:42.700\nBut I also need to be able to\nauthenticate against that machine.\n\n504\n00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:46.020\nAnd notice, I don't have any way to put\ncredentials in here to authenticate.\n\n505\n00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:49.040\nSo, I might need to connect to that\nmachine first before I actually see it.\n\n506\n00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:51.180\nSo, if I jump over to\nthat Windows machine,\n\n507\n00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:54.515\nI'm just gonna grab its IP address real\nquick so I can find it on the network.\n\n508\n00:22:54.515 --> 00:22:58.661\nAnd let me see, 192.168.0.146.\n\n509\n00:22:58.661 --> 00:23:02.620\nAnd what IP address do I have,\ncuz that is an odd network?\n\n510\n00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:07.971\nSo, if I just jump in here real\nquick to check my IP address,\n\n511\n00:23:07.971 --> 00:23:12.190\noops, if I can use the right command.\n\n512\n00:23:12.190 --> 00:23:14.760\nI am, okay, so\nI should be on the same network.\n\n513\n00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:18.260\nWhat I'm gonna do, is I'm just gonna\nestablish a quick connection to that node.\n\n514\n00:23:18.260 --> 00:23:19.840\nThis helps on a Windows machine.\n\n515\n00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:24.390\nSo, if you just go into Finder, let me get\nthis out of the way, just go into Finder.\n\n516\n00:23:24.390 --> 00:23:27.580\nAnd you can go to Go,\nand Connect to Server.\n\n517\n00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:29.420\nAnd I'm gonna connect to that server.\n\n518\n00:23:29.420 --> 00:23:34.519\nAnd so,\nI'm gonna do just snb//192.168.0.146.\n\n519\n00:23:34.519 --> 00:23:35.960\nAnd I'm gonna try and connect.\n\n520\n00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:40.080\nNow, the reason I'm doing this is, when I\ngo to connect, it's gonna prompt me for\n\n521\n00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:40.640\ncredentials.\n\n522\n00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:43.500\nI have to have a user account\non that other system to connect.\n\n523\n00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:45.978\nAnd once I give it those credentials,\n\n524\n00:23:45.978 --> 00:23:50.090\nthen I should be able to see\neverything that's on that system.\n\n525\n00:23:50.090 --> 00:23:53.098\nSo, I'm gonna do that right now,\nand I'll go ahead and\n\n526\n00:23:53.098 --> 00:23:54.897\nremember those in the key chain.\n\n527\n00:23:54.897 --> 00:23:59.357\nNow, using this Go menu is what I'd\nnormally do when I'm accessing files, But\n\n528\n00:23:59.357 --> 00:24:00.631\nI want to do printers.\n\n529\n00:24:00.631 --> 00:24:04.057\nBut remember what I said, S&B can be\nused for both files and printers.\n\n530\n00:24:04.057 --> 00:24:07.676\nSo I'm gonna get connected here, and\nnow it's showing me the volumes,\n\n531\n00:24:07.676 --> 00:24:10.659\nthe files that I can connect too,\nwhich there aren't any.\n\n532\n00:24:10.659 --> 00:24:11.748\nRight, well, that's okay.\n\n533\n00:24:11.748 --> 00:24:16.810\nI'm just gonna cancel that, because now\nwhen I go back to my screen here, I should\n\n534\n00:24:16.810 --> 00:24:20.500\nbe able to go in and find it because\nI'm authenticated on the machine now.\n\n535\n00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:24.720\nI'm gonna cancel that though, and\ngo back in to make it refresh, otherwise,\n\n536\n00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:26.050\nit doesn't refresh.\n\n537\n00:24:26.050 --> 00:24:29.530\nAnd now when I look, and,\nwell, shoot, nothing.\n\n538\n00:24:29.530 --> 00:24:33.740\nNow, troubleshooting this, this is\nactually not gonna be a Mac problem, this\n\n539\n00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:36.842\nis gonna be a Windows problem, the Windows\nmachine is not advertising its printer.\n\n540\n00:24:36.842 --> 00:24:39.540\nRemember how I said that\nit shares them by default?\n\n541\n00:24:39.540 --> 00:24:41.980\nWell it does, but\nit doesn't necessarily advertise it.\n\n542\n00:24:41.980 --> 00:24:46.320\nSo if I take a look at this Windows\nmachine, and I go into the printers on it,\n\n543\n00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:49.700\nso I'm just gonna go into devices and\nprinters,\n\n544\n00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:54.720\nI should be able to find that HP\nprinter in its printer list eventually,\n\n545\n00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:57.870\napparently, it's the slowest\nWindows machine on the planet.\n\n546\n00:24:57.870 --> 00:25:00.310\nBut I can find that printer and\nI can make sure it's shared out.\n\n547\n00:25:00.310 --> 00:25:04.537\nBut the other thing is that I need Windows\nfile and printer sharing turned on and\n\n548\n00:25:04.537 --> 00:25:06.790\nthat may or may not actually be turned on.\n\n549\n00:25:06.790 --> 00:25:10.410\nSo, let me get into my network and\nsharing center, and\n\n550\n00:25:10.410 --> 00:25:13.118\nwe can find out whether or\nnot that's even turned on.\n\n551\n00:25:13.118 --> 00:25:17.020\nSo, so when I jump in here,\nI'm connecting to a private network,\n\n552\n00:25:17.020 --> 00:25:22.025\nwhich is exactly what I wanted to see, and\nI've got network discovery turned on and\n\n553\n00:25:22.025 --> 00:25:23.650\nI've turned on file and\nprinter sharing, so\n\n554\n00:25:23.650 --> 00:25:28.910\nwe actually should be good to go, as far\nas advertising the printer on the network,\n\n555\n00:25:28.910 --> 00:25:31.750\nassuming that I'm actually\nsharing the printer.\n\n556\n00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:36.224\nSo, I'm assuming I've got a problem\nhere because my printer's control\n\n557\n00:25:36.224 --> 00:25:37.910\npanel never came up.\n\n558\n00:25:37.910 --> 00:25:39.140\nThere it is, all right.\n\n559\n00:25:39.140 --> 00:25:41.260\nOkay, so\nlooking at my printers in the list here,\n\n560\n00:25:41.260 --> 00:25:46.210\nI can find that HP LaserJet M401dne,\nthere it is,\n\n561\n00:25:46.210 --> 00:25:50.830\nthere is the printer on this system,\nand I'm just gonna go into my printer\n\n562\n00:25:50.830 --> 00:25:55.760\nproperties, and into sharing,\nand it is shared out.\n\n563\n00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:58.540\nIt's shared out with the name, and\nit could be that name is duplicated on\n\n564\n00:25:58.540 --> 00:26:00.460\nthe network, so\nI'm gonna give it a different name.\n\n565\n00:26:00.460 --> 00:26:03.110\nI'll call it Studio Printer Windows.\n\n566\n00:26:03.110 --> 00:26:05.900\nIf you have a duplicate name,\nthat can wreak all sorts of havoc.\n\n567\n00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:07.070\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and add that in.\n\n568\n00:26:07.070 --> 00:26:10.920\nAnd that should be all I need to do, and\n\n569\n00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:14.080\nonce that's done,\nnow we can jump back over to the Mac.\n\n570\n00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:16.500\nAnd it should start to detect\nthis printer on the network.\n\n571\n00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:19.410\nNow, one problem I've bumped into is Apple\n\n572\n00:26:19.410 --> 00:26:23.110\nreally doesn't like to refresh\nthe network detection that it does.\n\n573\n00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:26.734\nSo I just made a change to that printer\nand it may not show up in here right away\n\n574\n00:26:26.734 --> 00:26:29.030\nand, well, apparently, I'm a big,\nfat liar cuz now it's showing up.\n\n575\n00:26:29.030 --> 00:26:32.100\nSo, when I look, there it is,\nsure enough, I see win-client01.\n\n576\n00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:35.140\nWait, it didn't truly refresh though,\nbut I do see the client.\n\n577\n00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:37.250\nAnd now it's prompting me to authenticate.\n\n578\n00:26:37.250 --> 00:26:38.300\nThat's what I wanted to see.\n\n579\n00:26:39.740 --> 00:26:41.660\nAll right, and I'll go ahead and\nremember that.\n\n580\n00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:42.580\nSo I'm gonna authenticate and\n\n581\n00:26:42.580 --> 00:26:47.520\nconnect, and once that does,\nI should see the printer in the list.\n\n582\n00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:49.870\nAnd I'll be able to pick it and\nconnect to it.\n\n583\n00:26:49.870 --> 00:26:52.552\nOnce I do that,\nanytime I print to the printer,\n\n584\n00:26:52.552 --> 00:26:55.447\nI'm actually gonna print\nto the Windows machine.\n\n585\n00:26:55.447 --> 00:26:58.956\nAnd then it will send the print job\nto the printer on my behalf, right?\n\n586\n00:26:58.956 --> 00:27:02.096\nSo it's now like a proxy in between me and\nthat printer for\n\n587\n00:27:02.096 --> 00:27:04.320\nevery communication that I do.\n\n588\n00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:07.520\nNow I just have to wait for\nit to finish being slow.\n\n589\n00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:09.890\nThis whole episode is turning out\nto be an exercise in patience.\n\n590\n00:27:09.890 --> 00:27:13.430\nI'll give you a little\nanecdote while we're waiting.\n\n591\n00:27:13.430 --> 00:27:16.860\nI used to support an Apple network for\na law firm in Orlando.\n\n592\n00:27:16.860 --> 00:27:20.790\nAnd, we had this one giant laser printer\nin the middle of the office that we\n\n593\n00:27:20.790 --> 00:27:24.290\nprinted everything for, and all of our\nlegal documents had to be turned in by 4\n\n594\n00:27:24.290 --> 00:27:26.210\nPM at the courthouse every day.\n\n595\n00:27:26.210 --> 00:27:31.176\nAnd so, when it hit 3:30, all the\nattorneys would start printing like crazy.\n\n596\n00:27:31.176 --> 00:27:34.719\nAnd, if that laser printer hadn't been\nfired up yet, you'd have to wait for\n\n597\n00:27:34.719 --> 00:27:38.480\nit to warm up, and you'd just see people\nstanding around that printer waiting for\n\n598\n00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:41.640\nit to warm up, and we used to say it\nwas like boiling water, you know,\n\n599\n00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:43.860\nwhat is it a watched water-\n>> A watched pot never boils.\n\n600\n00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:44.370\n>> There we go.\n\n601\n00:27:44.370 --> 00:27:46.490\nAnd so, we would say a watched\nprinter never prints.\n\n602\n00:27:46.490 --> 00:27:49.430\nThat was kind of how this was and\nso it does require patience.\n\n603\n00:27:49.430 --> 00:27:51.030\nThere we go, all right.\n\n604\n00:27:51.030 --> 00:27:54.380\nSo now I see workgroup, win-client01, and\n\n605\n00:27:54.380 --> 00:27:57.040\nthere's that Studio Printer\nright there in the list.\n\n606\n00:27:57.040 --> 00:28:01.220\nAnd I can pick that but, look at this.\n\n607\n00:28:01.220 --> 00:28:03.170\nChose a Driver, right?\n\n608\n00:28:03.170 --> 00:28:06.820\nThe Windows machine is masking\nthe hardware of the printer,\n\n609\n00:28:06.820 --> 00:28:09.170\nso I can't really tell\nwhat the hardware is.\n\n610\n00:28:09.170 --> 00:28:12.960\nAnd the Windows machine only has a Windows\ndriver, it doesn't have an Apple driver.\n\n611\n00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:16.530\nSo on this side, I see the printer,\nI know it's there.\n\n612\n00:28:16.530 --> 00:28:18.040\nBut I don't know what driver to use.\n\n613\n00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:19.440\nAnd that's kind of annoying, but\n\n614\n00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:22.740\nthat's one of the things we have\nwhen we integrate Windows with Mac.\n\n615\n00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:24.740\nSometimes they don't\ncommunicate very nicely.\n\n616\n00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:29.310\nSo if I drop that down,\nI can pick from printer drivers.\n\n617\n00:28:29.310 --> 00:28:33.627\nAnd I can do a generic postscript or\nPCL, either one of those will work.\n\n618\n00:28:33.627 --> 00:28:37.075\nPCL is the printer control language,\nPostScript is the postscript language,\n\n619\n00:28:37.075 --> 00:28:38.522\nit doesn't stand for anything.\n\n620\n00:28:38.522 --> 00:28:42.170\nSo, both of those are kind of generic\nprinter languages that we can send.\n\n621\n00:28:42.170 --> 00:28:45.850\nAnd either one will work in this case,\nor I can just Select Software,\n\n622\n00:28:45.850 --> 00:28:49.235\nto pick from drivers that are already\ninstalled on my machine, or\n\n623\n00:28:49.235 --> 00:28:53.150\nI can choose Other to load a driver in.\n\n624\n00:28:53.150 --> 00:28:58.340\nBut here, I should be able\nto find the LaserJet M401,\n\n625\n00:28:58.340 --> 00:29:03.850\nthere we go, because I've already\nloaded it from other systems, right?\n\n626\n00:29:03.850 --> 00:29:05.540\nSo I can find that one and\npick it and that way,\n\n627\n00:29:05.540 --> 00:29:08.060\nit knows exactly what\ntype of printer that is.\n\n628\n00:29:08.060 --> 00:29:08.990\nAnd now I can add it in.\n\n629\n00:29:08.990 --> 00:29:11.549\nAnd when I'm done, I'm now connected, or\n\n630\n00:29:11.549 --> 00:29:14.946\nI will be connected to that\nprinter three different ways.\n\n631\n00:29:14.946 --> 00:29:20.485\nOne via Airprint and Bonjour,\none via Windows, and one via Direct IP.\n\n632\n00:29:20.485 --> 00:29:22.502\nNow I'm glad this screen popped up,\n\n633\n00:29:22.502 --> 00:29:26.810\nit's asking me to make sure I accurately\nreflect the hardware of the printer.\n\n634\n00:29:26.810 --> 00:29:32.050\nAgain, I can't see the hardware, so it's\nsaying, do we have the third tray option?\n\n635\n00:29:32.050 --> 00:29:35.730\nWhen you buy this printer, it's got two\ntrays in it, and there's an optional third\n\n636\n00:29:35.730 --> 00:29:39.460\ntray you can buy and stick on the bottom,\nit doesn't know if we have that or not.\n\n637\n00:29:39.460 --> 00:29:42.250\nSo I have to tell it whether we've\ngot the third tray, and we don't, so\n\n638\n00:29:42.250 --> 00:29:43.300\nI'm gonna leave that out.\n\n639\n00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:45.900\nThat's important because\nit can make that mistake\n\n640\n00:29:45.900 --> 00:29:48.180\neven when you directly\nconnect to the printer.\n\n641\n00:29:48.180 --> 00:29:49.940\nSome printers are super fancy.\n\n642\n00:29:49.940 --> 00:29:53.700\nThey have hole punchers and staplers and\nthings like that built into them.\n\n643\n00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:56.903\nSo you might need to come in here and\nchoose your printer,\n\n644\n00:29:56.903 --> 00:30:00.910\nregardless of which protocol,\nyou might have to choose your printer,\n\n645\n00:30:00.910 --> 00:30:03.379\ngo into Options and Supplies, and in here,\n\n646\n00:30:03.379 --> 00:30:07.759\nyou may need to tell it additional things\nabout the features of that printer.\n\n647\n00:30:07.759 --> 00:30:10.384\nAnd you'll see here,\nwhen I'm doing error print,\n\n648\n00:30:10.384 --> 00:30:12.480\nit's not giving me that option, right?\n\n649\n00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:17.214\nOr, when I go into IP, I don't\nreally see all that, actually I do,\n\n650\n00:30:17.214 --> 00:30:19.110\non IP, there we go.\n\n651\n00:30:19.110 --> 00:30:20.395\nIt's asking about tray three, and so\n\n652\n00:30:20.395 --> 00:30:22.530\nI can tell it whether I've\ngot tray three or not.\n\n653\n00:30:22.530 --> 00:30:25.550\nIf you got a really fancy printer,\nyou might have to tell it, yeah,\n\n654\n00:30:25.550 --> 00:30:29.320\nI've got a multiplexer unit on it,\nor I've got a stapler on it.\n\n655\n00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:32.040\nYou have to tell it those options so\nit knows what's available and\n\n656\n00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:32.940\nnow you're ready to work with this.\n\n657\n00:30:32.940 --> 00:30:33.880\nThat's kind of an important thing.\n\n658\n00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:37.170\n>> Yeah, Don, you might remember, Don and\nI worked together at an insurance company.\n\n659\n00:30:37.170 --> 00:30:38.510\nThey had a check printer.\n\n660\n00:30:38.510 --> 00:30:40.740\nAnd one day,\nthey bought a new check printer.\n\n661\n00:30:40.740 --> 00:30:44.770\nIt was basically an updated version\nof the one they had previously.\n\n662\n00:30:44.770 --> 00:30:46.260\nAnd the old driver would work, right?\n\n663\n00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:48.980\nYou could plug it in, turn it on,\nand just use the old connection.\n\n664\n00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:50.630\nYou had the same IP address.\n\n665\n00:30:50.630 --> 00:30:52.040\nSo everything seemed to\nbe working correctly.\n\n666\n00:30:52.040 --> 00:30:54.930\nAnd they said,\nthat tray isn't showing up, and it was\n\n667\n00:30:54.930 --> 00:30:58.140\nbecause that driver was not correct,\nit didn't have those functionalities\n\n668\n00:30:58.140 --> 00:31:01.710\nbecause it was a different printer\nthat didn't have that specific tray.\n\n669\n00:31:01.710 --> 00:31:03.858\nSo we had to get the new driver,\nupdate everybody, and\n\n670\n00:31:03.858 --> 00:31:05.037\nthen things started to work.\n\n671\n00:31:05.037 --> 00:31:08.267\n>> Yeah, you can really bump into\nsome troubles with that stuff.\n\n672\n00:31:08.267 --> 00:31:10.509\nAnd other differences\nit might have is like,\n\n673\n00:31:10.509 --> 00:31:14.403\nwhen you have printers that can print on\nboth sides of the paper, some of them,\n\n674\n00:31:14.403 --> 00:31:17.419\nwhen they go to print on the other side,\nflip it vertically.\n\n675\n00:31:17.419 --> 00:31:21.170\nOthers actually print on both sides,\nand some of them don't flip at all.\n\n676\n00:31:21.170 --> 00:31:23.190\nAnd so, your software has\nto know which way to do it.\n\n677\n00:31:23.190 --> 00:31:24.450\nThe drivers help determine that.\n\n678\n00:31:24.450 --> 00:31:26.910\nSo it is important to have\nthat right information.\n\n679\n00:31:26.910 --> 00:31:29.580\nBut what we just saw was three different\nways that we can add printers to\n\n680\n00:31:29.580 --> 00:31:30.130\nour systems.\n\n681\n00:31:30.130 --> 00:31:33.400\nSo, again, when we integrate into our\nnetwork, we don't have to have all Macs,\n\n682\n00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:35.860\nwe don't have to do all AirPrint,\nyou can do Direct IP,\n\n683\n00:31:35.860 --> 00:31:39.130\nyou can print through a shared Windows\nprinter, you just have to kind of get it\n\n684\n00:31:39.130 --> 00:31:42.180\nset up and, Windows was the hardest one\nthere, cuz I had to authenticate, right?\n\n685\n00:31:42.180 --> 00:31:43.930\nI had to kind of jump\nthrough those hurdles.\n\n686\n00:31:43.930 --> 00:31:46.514\nBut once I got through that,\nthen I was able to add the printer, and\n\n687\n00:31:46.514 --> 00:31:49.068\nnow I've got it and I don't have\nto worry about it again, right?\n\n688\n00:31:49.068 --> 00:31:52.167\nSo a lot of functionality there,\nall important to know.\n\n689\n00:31:52.167 --> 00:31:52.748\n>> All right.\n\n690\n00:31:52.748 --> 00:31:55.847\nNow, Don, I think we've got\na little bit of time left.\n\n691\n00:31:55.847 --> 00:31:58.308\nAnd I'm gonna pick your brain on this.\n\n692\n00:31:58.308 --> 00:31:59.505\nWe start sharing obviously.\n\n693\n00:31:59.505 --> 00:32:01.320\nWe're sharing that printer out in Windows.\n\n694\n00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:03.340\nCan we do the same thing in our Macs for\n\n695\n00:32:03.340 --> 00:32:07.450\nwe have our printer that's connected and\nshare it out for other Macs to connect to.\n\n696\n00:32:07.450 --> 00:32:08.010\n>> No.\n\n697\n00:32:08.010 --> 00:32:08.605\n>> All right.\nSweet.\n\n698\n00:32:08.605 --> 00:32:09.626\n[LAUGH] Thanks for watching everyone.\n\n699\n00:32:09.626 --> 00:32:11.660\n>> No, you can't.\n\n700\n00:32:11.660 --> 00:32:12.780\nAgain, it's not ideal.\n\n701\n00:32:12.780 --> 00:32:14.350\nWe don't wanna be dependent\nin our own machine.\n\n702\n00:32:14.350 --> 00:32:15.190\nBut certainly can.\n\n703\n00:32:15.190 --> 00:32:17.980\nSo, for example,\nI added this IP printer right here.\n\n704\n00:32:17.980 --> 00:32:20.010\nSo, I got the studio printer IP.\n\n705\n00:32:20.010 --> 00:32:23.590\nAnd if I wanna share that with other\npeople, the options right here, share this\n\n706\n00:32:23.590 --> 00:32:27.440\nprinter on the network, I can check that\nright there and I can go in my sharing\n\n707\n00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:31.290\npreferences and I can set how I wanna\nshare down now look where it took me.\n\n708\n00:32:31.290 --> 00:32:34.240\nIt took me right into the sharing\nsystem preferences and\n\n709\n00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:37.050\nthat's kind of an easier place\nto go to get that setup right.\n\n710\n00:32:37.050 --> 00:32:40.070\nIf I just go in to my system preferences.\n\n711\n00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:44.160\nAnd I go down to sharing, that's\nwhere all of my other sharing is and\n\n712\n00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:46.170\nprinter sharing has its own line item.\n\n713\n00:32:46.170 --> 00:32:49.150\nAnd so I can share all of\nmy printers out if I want.\n\n714\n00:32:49.150 --> 00:32:51.500\nBut the cool thing is that\nwhen you share these out,\n\n715\n00:32:51.500 --> 00:32:53.690\nyou can pick who gets what access.\n\n716\n00:32:53.690 --> 00:32:56.870\nNow I'm set so everyone can print,\nbut maybe I don't want that.\n\n717\n00:32:56.870 --> 00:33:00.310\nI can drop that down and set it so\nthat nobody can print, and\n\n718\n00:33:00.310 --> 00:33:02.090\nthen only other people can get access.\n\n719\n00:33:02.090 --> 00:33:05.850\nSo maybe I wanna add we'll add myself,\nright?\n\n720\n00:33:05.850 --> 00:33:10.030\nAnd so I'm gonna say Don Pezet can\nprint but everyone else gets no access.\n\n721\n00:33:10.030 --> 00:33:14.100\nSo now I'm picking and\nchoosing who I want to be able to print.\n\n722\n00:33:14.100 --> 00:33:15.550\nI've got that functionality.\n\n723\n00:33:15.550 --> 00:33:17.350\nAnd now I become the print server.\n\n724\n00:33:17.350 --> 00:33:19.040\nSo I may wanna go that route.\n\n725\n00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:24.180\nAnd if you've got a system\nthat's running the server app.\n\n726\n00:33:24.180 --> 00:33:26.760\nSo I've already got a server\nthat I'm setting up.\n\n727\n00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:31.360\nWhen I go into my server, you've got\nthat advanced file sharing here,\n\n728\n00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:34.760\nwhere you can set up your shared files and\nbuild up that server.\n\n729\n00:33:34.760 --> 00:33:36.250\nPrinting is not in that list.\n\n730\n00:33:36.250 --> 00:33:39.425\nI don't actually have\na print server in here.\n\n731\n00:33:39.425 --> 00:33:41.935\nBut there's no reason I\ncan't add my printers in and\n\n732\n00:33:41.935 --> 00:33:45.725\nshare them out when you're using the same\nsystem preferences in share it that way.\n\n733\n00:33:45.725 --> 00:33:49.835\nSo, the work station side is really the\nsame as the server side when it comes to\n\n734\n00:33:49.835 --> 00:33:50.625\nsharing out a printer.\n\n735\n00:33:50.625 --> 00:33:54.305\nBut yeah, we do it that way, you're other\nMacs will see it, and you're in business.\n\n736\n00:33:54.305 --> 00:33:55.015\n>> Very cool.\n\n737\n00:33:55.015 --> 00:33:59.745\nDon, obviously we got to kill some trees\ntoday, which is always a good time,\n\n738\n00:33:59.745 --> 00:34:02.510\nand we can't have,\nwe've got to deal with printers, right?\n\n739\n00:34:02.510 --> 00:34:06.090\nThey're just a part and partial of the IT\nlife, you gotta be able to support them,\n\n740\n00:34:06.090 --> 00:34:09.260\nyou gotta be able to connect them,\ntroubleshoot them, and work with them.\n\n741\n00:34:09.260 --> 00:34:12.550\nAnd hopefully this was a great primer for\nour users, I think you did a really good\n\n742\n00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:16.870\njob of explaining how we, the different\nways, anyway, that we can get connected\n\n743\n00:34:16.870 --> 00:34:22.360\nfrom our Macs, to either a Windows system\nor just network connect printers as well.\n\n744\n00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:24.990\nDon is there any closing remarks you'd\nlike to give to our viewers before\n\n745\n00:34:24.990 --> 00:34:25.840\nwe sign off?\n\n746\n00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:28.040\n>> That's about it.\n\n747\n00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:31.430\nI guess one other thing is the printer\nhere that I was dealing with this whole\n\n748\n00:34:31.430 --> 00:34:32.900\ntime is a physical printer.\n\n749\n00:34:32.900 --> 00:34:38.257\nYour Mac actually has a virtual printer\nloaded into it where it can print to PDF,\n\n750\n00:34:38.257 --> 00:34:39.370\nright.\n\n751\n00:34:39.370 --> 00:34:41.810\nAnd so be aware that that's\nkinda what's replacing paper, so\n\n752\n00:34:41.810 --> 00:34:44.680\nif I just wanna a copy of a webpage or\nsomething, I can print it to a PDF.\n\n753\n00:34:44.680 --> 00:34:49.270\nAnd so you'll see that if I go,\nlet me just take, can I do it in terminal,\n\n754\n00:34:49.270 --> 00:34:50.410\nof course not?\n\n755\n00:34:50.410 --> 00:34:54.960\nIf I go pull up a webpage, right, and\nI go out and, I'll go to CNN.com.\n\n756\n00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:58.129\nAnd so I find something on here,\nsome article, and I wanna print it out.\n\n757\n00:34:59.330 --> 00:35:00.770\nGood God, US declares genocide.\n\n758\n00:35:00.770 --> 00:35:01.960\nThat's not something I want to print out.\n\n759\n00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:04.110\nSea World says goodbye to Shamu,\nhow about that?\n\n760\n00:35:04.110 --> 00:35:05.510\nSo we'll go in here.\n\n761\n00:35:05.510 --> 00:35:06.860\nAnd I wanna print this thing out.\n\n762\n00:35:06.860 --> 00:35:10.500\nSo I can go up here and\nuse the Print option,\n\n763\n00:35:10.500 --> 00:35:12.390\nwhich, does Safari not\nhave a Print option?\n\n764\n00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:15.110\nWell, shoot.\n\n765\n00:35:15.110 --> 00:35:18.315\nAnyhow, I can go into\napps like TextEdit then.\n\n766\n00:35:18.315 --> 00:35:20.890\n[LAUGH] I'll find\nsomething that can print.\n\n767\n00:35:20.890 --> 00:35:24.490\nAnd once I'm in TextEdit I\ncan start typing a document.\n\n768\n00:35:24.490 --> 00:35:26.460\nSo this is a document.\n\n769\n00:35:26.460 --> 00:35:29.990\nAnd when I go to print it,\nI can print that to physical printers.\n\n770\n00:35:29.990 --> 00:35:34.600\nWhich is what we wanna do if we want\nto have everybody to have access to it.\n\n771\n00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:39.880\nOr when I go to print, so\nI go to File and I go to Print.\n\n772\n00:35:39.880 --> 00:35:40.860\nThere we go.\n\n773\n00:35:40.860 --> 00:35:45.920\nAnd when I go to print, see how my printer\nhere is chosen as studio printer, right?\n\n774\n00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:47.460\nBut way down here at the bottom,\n\n775\n00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:53.570\nsee how it's got this PDF option\nthat we can choose to save as PDF.\n\n776\n00:35:53.570 --> 00:35:55.490\nWrite or save as PostScript or whatever.\n\n777\n00:35:55.490 --> 00:35:59.340\nWe don't have to print two of printer,\nwe could print to a PDF or\n\n778\n00:35:59.340 --> 00:36:03.490\nsave it as a PDF and so,\nyou may have an option up here for but,\n\n779\n00:36:03.490 --> 00:36:06.970\nnormally we just uses PDF option down\nthere that's called Virtual printer.\n\n780\n00:36:06.970 --> 00:36:09.610\nAnd it's a virtual printer\nthat's a part of every Mac\n\n781\n00:36:09.610 --> 00:36:12.130\nthat you can just export to PDF\ninstead of printing to paper.\n\n782\n00:36:12.130 --> 00:36:13.130\nSo just be aware of that one.\n\n783\n00:36:13.130 --> 00:36:15.470\nIt's a nice alternative\nto killing some trees.\n\n784\n00:36:15.470 --> 00:36:17.450\n>> Yeah,\nit's actually is a nice little tip there.\n\n785\n00:36:17.450 --> 00:36:18.530\nSo I'm glad you remembered that.\n\n786\n00:36:18.530 --> 00:36:21.397\nWith that being said, I'm looking at the\nclock, it has ticked it's last tock, Don.\n\n787\n00:36:21.397 --> 00:36:23.241\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Thanks again for stopping by and\n\n788\n00:36:23.241 --> 00:36:24.238\nexplaining these things.\n\n789\n00:36:24.238 --> 00:36:25.377\nThank you guys for watching.\n\n790\n00:36:25.377 --> 00:36:27.837\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for itprotv.\n\n791\n00:36:27.837 -->

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:17.003 --> 00:00:18.429\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, and\n\n4\n00:00:18.429 --> 00:00:22.250\nin today's episode we're continuing on\nwith our Mac integration basics series.\n\n5\n00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.310\nJoining us back in the studio again\ntoday to lend his gigantic geek,\n\n6\n00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.790\nI mean brain to that very endeavor,\nis none other than our friend, Don Pezet.\n\n7\n00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:30.960\nDon, welcome to the show sir.\n\n8\n00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:31.880\n>> Thanks for having me back, Daniel.\n\n9\n00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.780\nReady to jump right back\ninto the world of Mac.\n\n10\n00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.920\nAnd today we're gonna be looking a very,\nvery important service,\n\n11\n00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.470\nwhich is instant messaging.\n\n12\n00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:41.090\nThat's right,\nwe're jumping in the way back machine.\n\n13\n00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:43.131\nAnd we're jumping back to 1997, and\n\n14\n00:00:43.131 --> 00:00:45.706\nwe are firing up our instant\nmessaging on top of Mac.\n\n15\n00:00:45.706 --> 00:00:49.981\nNow I like to make fun of it,\nit does still see a lot of use even today,\n\n16\n00:00:49.981 --> 00:00:51.035\nit is out there.\n\n17\n00:00:51.035 --> 00:00:55.296\nAnd it's another area where Apple has made\na client on your system that is compatible\n\n18\n00:00:55.296 --> 00:00:58.118\nwith a number of different\nother services out there, so\n\n19\n00:00:58.118 --> 00:01:02.140\nit's something we can integrate, and\nthus it makes it into this show.\n\n20\n00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.450\nSo, let's start here\nkind of simple just for\n\n21\n00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:06.960\nthose of you who aren't familiar\nwith what I'm talking about.\n\n22\n00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.360\nInside of Mac OS,\nthere's an app called iMessages, right?\n\n23\n00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.520\nWell it's just called Messages now,\nit used to be called iMessage,\n\n24\n00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.000\nthey change the name of things.\n\n25\n00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.910\nBut it actually used to be called iChat\nforever ago, but now it's Messages.\n\n26\n00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:22.404\nAnd the Messages app is designed to let\nyou chat, to do quick chats with other\n\n27\n00:01:22.404 --> 00:01:27.057\npeople that are out there on your network,\nor out in the Internet or whatever.\n\n28\n00:01:27.057 --> 00:01:32.210\nSo, for those of you younguns, think\nlike Snapchat or something like that.\n\n29\n00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.100\n>> It's just texting, sounds a lot\nlike texting to be honest with you.\n\n30\n00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.570\n>> It's very much like texting, but\nyou don't need a cell phone account,\n\n31\n00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:37.680\nit's just done via the Internet.\n\n32\n00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.420\nNow for those of you that have used the\nInternet a while you'll remember things\n\n33\n00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.990\nlike AOL Instant Messenger or\nYahoo Messenger.\n\n34\n00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.730\n>> ICQ?\n\n35\n00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:50.160\n>> ICQ is one of the original ones,\nMSN Messenger, the Microsoft one.\n\n36\n00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.950\nThere was a time, where every company\nout there had a messaging client, and\n\n37\n00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:55.550\nApple was one of them, right?\n\n38\n00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:57.360\nSo they had their own\nlittle messaging client.\n\n39\n00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.340\nBut Apple went a slightly\ndifferent angle with their's and\n\n40\n00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.450\nthey said,\nApple has a fairly small market share,\n\n41\n00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.510\nwe don't want to try and\nforce people over to our server, so\n\n42\n00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:09.340\nwhy don't we just create something\nthat's compatible with everybody else.\n\n43\n00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.890\nAnd that way you can pick whatever\nyou want, and connect up and work.\n\n44\n00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.011\nAnd that's what they did, and we still\nhave it available today in El Capitan.\n\n45\n00:02:16.011 --> 00:02:18.530\nSo let's take a look at the messaging app.\n\n46\n00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.720\nSo, when you install El Capitan in\nthe docking bar down at the very bottom,\n\n47\n00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.170\none of the default apps is Messages,\nright?\n\n48\n00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.300\nThat's what used to be iMessage, or\niChat, or whatever, we have Messages.\n\n49\n00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.745\nNow if I fire that up,\nit's not a terribly exciting program,\n\n50\n00:02:33.745 --> 00:02:36.920\nbecause it comes up and\nI can talk to myself.\n\n51\n00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.383\nWhich I can do without a chat program and\nbe just as sane, right?\n\n52\n00:02:40.383 --> 00:02:43.587\nSo, the program by itself\nis not terribly useful,\n\n53\n00:02:43.587 --> 00:02:47.420\nwe need to make it where can\nhave two people talk together.\n\n54\n00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.490\nAnd there's a number of\ndifferent ways to do it.\n\n55\n00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:54.160\nThe easiest and quickest way to\nget it going is to use Bonjour.\n\n56\n00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.510\nThe Bonjour protocol, it's running\nin the background on your Mac, and\n\n57\n00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.090\nit helps us discover and\nfind other devices.\n\n58\n00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.280\nWe can also use it to chat back and\nforth between devices.\n\n59\n00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.520\nSo, for example, I've got a Mac here, and\nI'm logged into it as me, as Don Pezet.\n\n60\n00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:12.680\nAnd then I've got another Mac here,\nthat I'm logged into as Daniel Lowrie.\n\n61\n00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.518\nAnd so here is a second Mac, these\nare separate they're not in the same open\n\n62\n00:03:15.518 --> 00:03:18.102\ndirectory, I don't have active\ndirectory or anything like that.\n\n63\n00:03:18.102 --> 00:03:22.129\nThese are just stand alone Macs that\nare logged in as these individual people,\n\n64\n00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:23.270\nall right.\n\n65\n00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:27.210\nBut once you're set up what you can\ndo is you can go into Messages, and\n\n66\n00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:30.830\nif you go up to Messages and Preferences,\n\n67\n00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:35.680\nwhen you dive into the Preferences,\nyou can go to Accounts, and\n\n68\n00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.810\nright here inside of Accounts you'll\nsee where you can get yourself set up.\n\n69\n00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:44.280\nNow, I'm connected to an Apple ID, and\nso it shows my Apple ID right here,\n\n70\n00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.120\nthat I'm attached, and that it's enabled.\n\n71\n00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.570\nAnd so, if anybody out there wants to chat\nwith me, or at least in this lab machine,\n\n72\n00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:54.130\nthen they could find my Apple ID and\nstart to send me messages.\n\n73\n00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:57.030\nBut that's not the default,\nif I look at Daniel's machine here, and\n\n74\n00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.850\nI fire up Messages,\n\n75\n00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:03.010\nand I'm gonna do the same thing on his,\nwell, see it's not set up for an Apple ID.\n\n76\n00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:06.811\nAnd you don't have to, I could say,\nNot Now, I don't wanna use the Apple ID,\n\n77\n00:04:06.811 --> 00:04:08.780\nright, so I can skip past that.\n\n78\n00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:13.646\nAnd it goes right into Messages, and\nit offers to connect to other people.\n\n79\n00:04:13.646 --> 00:04:18.500\nGoogle, Yahoo, AOL, and\njust plain old other, all right?\n\n80\n00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.300\nI'm gonna cancel that too.\n\n81\n00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:21.600\nBecause what I wanna do is,\n\n82\n00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.310\nI don't wanna have internet chat,\nI wanna have local network chat.\n\n83\n00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:29.288\nSo I'm gonna go to Messages and\nPreferences, and inside of here,\n\n84\n00:04:29.288 --> 00:04:34.130\nunder Accounts, see how he's got iMessage\nis inactive, Bonjour is inactive.\n\n85\n00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:36.592\nI'm gonna take Bonjour and\nI'm gonna turn it on.\n\n86\n00:04:36.592 --> 00:04:40.080\nI'm enabling Bonjour instant messaging,\nokay?\n\n87\n00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.850\nAnd then it's got Publish my email\nin instant message addresses,\n\n88\n00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:45.180\nBlock others from seeing\nmy status as idle.\n\n89\n00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.200\nWe can kind of customize it a little bit.\n\n90\n00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.830\nWe'll go ahead and\npublish our email out there, so\n\n91\n00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:53.160\nthat other people on the same network\nas me will be able to find that system.\n\n92\n00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:57.710\nAnd as soon as I did that,\nthis little window popped up.\n\n93\n00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:00.040\nAnd it's showing that Daniel is available.\n\n94\n00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:00.660\nHe's online.\n\n95\n00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:04.160\nHe supports video as well as text chat,\nbut\n\n96\n00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.330\nthere's nobody else out there,\nhe's very, very lonely.\n\n97\n00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:07.490\nYou can see it on his face.\n\n98\n00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:10.048\nSo I need to go ahead and\nget somebody else set up.\n\n99\n00:05:10.048 --> 00:05:11.280\nSo I'm gonna jump over to my machine,\n\n100\n00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:14.070\nand the first thing I'm gonna do is\nI'm gonna turn off that Apple ID.\n\n101\n00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:16.860\nSo I'm just gonna inactivate that,\nI don't need that.\n\n102\n00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:18.850\nAnd I'm gonna turn my Bonjour on.\n\n103\n00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:21.579\nSo I'm gonna turn that on, and\nI'll publish my email too.\n\n104\n00:05:21.579 --> 00:05:26.443\nNow unlike Daniel's, when I turn it on,\nI immediately see Daniel out there, right?\n\n105\n00:05:26.443 --> 00:05:29.105\nSo there he is, and I see myself.\n\n106\n00:05:29.105 --> 00:05:31.996\nOur machines found each\nother by using Bonjour.\n\n107\n00:05:31.996 --> 00:05:36.605\nAnd if I jump back to his machine,\nwell, he doesn't see me.\n\n108\n00:05:36.605 --> 00:05:37.129\nWhy not?\n\n109\n00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:39.780\nWell, he doesn't see me\nbecause it takes a moment.\n\n110\n00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:41.521\nBonjour is not constantly\nscanning the network,\n\n111\n00:05:41.521 --> 00:05:43.420\nit would generate too\nmuch network traffic.\n\n112\n00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:46.030\nSo it's scanning periodically to look and\nfind people.\n\n113\n00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:49.610\nI'll turn up here eventually,\nit just hasn't happened yet.\n\n114\n00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:52.560\nAnd you can kinda spur along if you want,\nlike you can.\n\n115\n00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:56.080\nThere is a way to force a refresh in here,\nwhich I just can't remember how to do,\n\n116\n00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:58.970\nbut the easiest way is to just\nquit out and go back into it, and\n\n117\n00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:00.540\nthen he should see me pop up.\n\n118\n00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:05.400\nSo I'll just go ahead and\nlaunch this again, and we'll wait and\n\n119\n00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:06.630\nsee if it spots it for us.\n\n120\n00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:09.570\nSo anyhow, we are showing as available,\nso we're up, so\n\n121\n00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:12.910\nwe should be good to go, and I'll just\nsend a message over, that'll help.\n\n122\n00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:15.581\nSo over here on my machine,\nI'm just gonna pick Daniel.\n\n123\n00:06:15.581 --> 00:06:17.271\nAnd if I double-click on him,\n\n124\n00:06:17.271 --> 00:06:20.132\nI'm now opening up a chat\nsession to Daniel Lowrie.\n\n125\n00:06:20.132 --> 00:06:24.575\nAnd see how how he's got a green light,\nIt means that he's online and I can say,\n\n126\n00:06:24.575 --> 00:06:26.790\nhey, how are you doing?\n\n127\n00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:28.920\nRight, and\nI can send that message over to him.\n\n128\n00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:31.460\nNow look what it says here, Bonjour IM,\n\n129\n00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:35.124\nit was an instant message sent\nwith the Bonjour protocol,\n\n130\n00:06:35.124 --> 00:06:40.304\nto dlowrie@osx-client02, that's his\ncomputer that I sent the message to.\n\n131\n00:06:40.304 --> 00:06:42.549\nSo we'll jump over to\nDaniel's machine now, and\n\n132\n00:06:42.549 --> 00:06:46.194\nsure enough over here in my friend list I\nsee Daniel Lowrie and Don Pezet, right?\n\n133\n00:06:46.194 --> 00:06:48.984\nI show up in that list now\nwhere I wasn't a moment ago,\n\n134\n00:06:48.984 --> 00:06:53.070\nright, just kinda sent that bullet\non the network and it picked it up.\n\n135\n00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:56.470\nAnd then over here, I can see,\nI've got a new message from Don, and\n\n136\n00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:57.680\nthere it is, right.\n\n137\n00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:59.110\nSo it's showing, Hey how are you doing?\n\n138\n00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:03.150\nAnd then we can respond back,\nI'm doing well.\n\n139\n00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:03.869\nHow about you?\n\n140\n00:07:03.869 --> 00:07:05.507\nThis is how Daniel and\nI's conversations go.\n\n141\n00:07:05.507 --> 00:07:07.080\n>> Yes, all of them.\n\n142\n00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:08.319\n>> So we can send that back.\n\n143\n00:07:08.319 --> 00:07:12.207\nAnd when I go back to my machine, there's\nthat response, and we're now chatting and\n\n144\n00:07:12.207 --> 00:07:13.944\njust having a great old time, right?\n\n145\n00:07:13.944 --> 00:07:18.480\nSo, getting this chat running\non a local network, super easy.\n\n146\n00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:19.520\nI don't need a server.\n\n147\n00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:20.590\nI don't need an external service.\n\n148\n00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:22.260\nI don't even need the Internet.\n\n149\n00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:23.910\nI just need two computers\non the same network,\n\n150\n00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:27.560\nwhere they can find each other, and\nwe can use Bonjour to communicate.\n\n151\n00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:31.650\nSo that's the first way of implementing\ninstant messaging inside of Mac OS,\n\n152\n00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:32.260\nsuper easy.\n\n153\n00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.440\nAnd it'll even do files and video too.\n\n154\n00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:36.900\nSo if I want to send Daniel\na file of some sort.\n\n155\n00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:39.940\nI don't know if I actually\nhave any files laying around.\n\n156\n00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:45.740\nSo let's say I'm working in TextEdit and,\nThis is a document.\n\n157\n00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:48.080\nAnd so\nI create just a super sweet document.\n\n158\n00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:51.260\nI'm like, my goodness, Daniel's gotta\nsee this document, it's so awesome.\n\n159\n00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:52.500\n>> It's gonna change my life forever.\n\n160\n00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:54.268\n>> It is, you will not believe it,\n\n161\n00:07:54.268 --> 00:07:56.965\nthere'll be a visible\ndifference in your step.\n\n162\n00:07:56.965 --> 00:08:00.581\nSo I'm gonna get this document made and,\nso\n\n163\n00:08:00.581 --> 00:08:04.407\nthis will be my Awesome Document,\nall right.\n\n164\n00:08:04.407 --> 00:08:06.486\nSo I'll go ahead and save that.\n\n165\n00:08:06.486 --> 00:08:09.951\nAnd if I wanna send him that awesome\ndocument, well I could always\n\n166\n00:08:09.951 --> 00:08:13.870\nset up file sharing, or I can just drag\nit and drop it right into iMessage.\n\n167\n00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:17.087\nSo here's the awesome document and\nI can send it along, right?\n\n168\n00:08:17.087 --> 00:08:20.772\nAnd so, Awesome Document shows up,\nI jump over to him, and\n\n169\n00:08:20.772 --> 00:08:24.331\nhere's the Awesome Document and\nhe can click Download.\n\n170\n00:08:24.331 --> 00:08:28.023\nAnd it's gonna download and open up so,\nhe's pulling that right through Bonjour,\n\n171\n00:08:28.023 --> 00:08:29.486\nand exchange that information.\n\n172\n00:08:29.486 --> 00:08:31.880\nSo that's the way that works.\n\n173\n00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:34.531\nThe download just finished.\n\n174\n00:08:34.531 --> 00:08:39.914\nAnd, woo the anticipation, it's so great.\n\n175\n00:08:39.914 --> 00:08:41.273\nAnd eventually-\n>> I think if you click on the word,\n\n176\n00:08:41.273 --> 00:08:43.473\nyou've got to click on the word-\n>> Yeah, I didn't click enough,\n\n177\n00:08:43.473 --> 00:08:43.982\nthere we go.\n\n178\n00:08:43.982 --> 00:08:46.500\nI didn't click with enough conviction,\nthere we go.\n\n179\n00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:47.755\nBut there, he's got the document.\n\n180\n00:08:47.755 --> 00:08:51.558\nAnd we can even do video camera,\nvideo chat, or\n\n181\n00:08:51.558 --> 00:08:56.610\nwhatever between it again,\nall based on just simple Bonjour.\n\n182\n00:08:56.610 --> 00:08:59.527\nI don't know if I can do it here in this\nvirtual machine, can't start video chat,\n\n183\n00:08:59.527 --> 00:09:01.411\ncomputer's busy in another chat,\nwell all right.\n\n184\n00:09:01.411 --> 00:09:02.830\n>> Gonna wig out on you.\n\n185\n00:09:02.830 --> 00:09:05.150\n>> So yeah,\nI got too many chats going I guess.\n\n186\n00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:07.160\nWell, whatever.\n\n187\n00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:09.500\nAll right, so we can do video chat,\nit is a good time.\n\n188\n00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:11.960\nSo that's one way that\nwe can implement this.\n\n189\n00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:13.390\nBut this show's all about integrations.\n\n190\n00:09:13.390 --> 00:09:15.540\nSo how do I integrate with other\nservices that are out there?\n\n191\n00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:17.980\nWell unfortunately it's\nactually kinda hard, right?\n\n192\n00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:20.980\nBecause different chat services\nuse different protocols.\n\n193\n00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:24.641\nSo like AOL Instant Messenger and\nICQ and all those guys,\n\n194\n00:09:24.641 --> 00:09:27.320\nthey have different protocols they use.\n\n195\n00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:31.091\nWell, about eight years ago,\na lot of them got together and\n\n196\n00:09:31.091 --> 00:09:34.713\nstarted to try and\nmake things a little more compatible,\n\n197\n00:09:34.713 --> 00:09:38.352\nmake things a little more\ncross-platform compatible.\n\n198\n00:09:38.352 --> 00:09:41.533\nAnd so\nwe started to see some new messages.\n\n199\n00:09:41.533 --> 00:09:44.027\nAnd there was,\nXMPP was one of the big ones,\n\n200\n00:09:44.027 --> 00:09:47.264\nwhere it was a common chat\nprotocol that we could use, and\n\n201\n00:09:47.264 --> 00:09:51.054\nmost people didn't call it XMPP,\nthey called it Jabber, right?\n\n202\n00:09:51.054 --> 00:09:53.406\nSo you guys might have heard of it,\ndescribed as Jabber,\n\n203\n00:09:53.406 --> 00:09:54.931\nApple always calls it Jabber, too.\n\n204\n00:09:54.931 --> 00:10:01.310\nSo, you got where AOL Instant Messenger\nand Google Chat, Google Hangouts?\n\n205\n00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:04.860\nWell it became Google Hangouts, but\noriginally it was Google Chat, I think.\n\n206\n00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:08.470\nAnd even other people like Facebook,\nstarted to support Jabber.\n\n207\n00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:11.850\nAnd so for a period of several years,\nyou could use Jabber and\n\n208\n00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:13.570\nconnect to darn near anything.\n\n209\n00:10:13.570 --> 00:10:15.050\nWell, in the last year or\n\n210\n00:10:15.050 --> 00:10:18.610\ntwo a lot of people have started\nshutting off their Jabber support.\n\n211\n00:10:18.610 --> 00:10:20.590\nGoogle's already pulled it,\nFacebook has pulled it,\n\n212\n00:10:20.590 --> 00:10:24.580\nother people are starting to pull it,\nso it's not as awesome as it used to be.\n\n213\n00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:27.040\nSo Apple tries to keep up with it,\nbut it's hard for\n\n214\n00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:28.500\nthem to keep up with all of them.\n\n215\n00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:32.739\nSo in Messages, when I go in here,\nif I go back to Messages and Preferences.\n\n216\n00:10:33.950 --> 00:10:39.260\nAnd I go to the Accounts tab, I can see\nthose two accounts, Bonjour, and iCloud.\n\n217\n00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:42.530\nObviously, Apple's gonna support both\nof those, those are Apple technologies.\n\n218\n00:10:42.530 --> 00:10:46.670\nBut when I go down here and hit the plus\nsign to add another service, I see Google,\n\n219\n00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:50.190\nYahoo, AOL, I don't see Facebook,\nthey're gone,\n\n220\n00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:52.130\nthey don't support Jabber anymore, right?\n\n221\n00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:54.479\nSo, they've got communications\nhere with these guys.\n\n222\n00:10:55.650 --> 00:10:57.300\nIf I want to connect to\nGoogle I just choose that and\n\n223\n00:10:57.300 --> 00:10:59.720\nprovide my authentication,\nand then I'm in.\n\n224\n00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:01.375\nSame with Yahoo, same thing with AOL.\n\n225\n00:11:01.375 --> 00:11:04.890\nIf I choose Other though,\nif I choose Other,\n\n226\n00:11:04.890 --> 00:11:08.534\nI can connect to any\nJabber system that I want.\n\n227\n00:11:08.534 --> 00:11:11.430\nAny Jabber based system I can plug\nin my details, get connected, and\n\n228\n00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:12.630\nbe ready to rock.\n\n229\n00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:16.888\nNow I've got AIM for\nthe AOL Instant Messenger.\n\n230\n00:11:16.888 --> 00:11:19.459\nAnd then I've got Jabber right here, okay?\n\n231\n00:11:19.459 --> 00:11:22.520\nAnd when you choose Jabber you'll see\na server and a port number appears, and\n\n232\n00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:25.230\nnow we can reach out and\nconnect to these other systems.\n\n233\n00:11:25.230 --> 00:11:27.880\nNow, why do I bring this up?\n\n234\n00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:30.520\nWell, the reason I bring it up\nis that Jabber is a standard.\n\n235\n00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:34.810\nAnd so if you want to have a chat\nthat runs between Windows, Linux and\n\n236\n00:11:34.810 --> 00:11:38.430\nMac, then you don't wanna rely\non AOL Instant Messenger.\n\n237\n00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:41.150\nYou don't wanna rely on Yahoo,\nbecause they don't have a Linux client.\n\n238\n00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:43.160\nYou don't wanna rely on\nthese different vendors,\n\n239\n00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:45.110\nbecause they don't give you\nthat cross-compatibility.\n\n240\n00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:47.970\nSo your best solution is to\nset up your own Jabber server.\n\n241\n00:11:47.970 --> 00:11:51.030\nAnd when you set up your own Jabber\nserver, you can have all your clients\n\n242\n00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:54.510\nconnect to it just fine,\nincluding your Macs right here, all right?\n\n243\n00:11:54.510 --> 00:11:58.100\nNow, I know what you're thinking,\nI don't wanna set up a Jabber server,\n\n244\n00:11:58.100 --> 00:12:00.540\nthat sounds like a lot of work and\nI don't wanna do it.\n\n245\n00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:02.720\nWell I don't blame you, but\nit is actually pretty easy.\n\n246\n00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:03.940\nIf you wanna set up a Jabber server,\n\n247\n00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:08.720\nthe easiest way to do it is to fire\nup Mac OS and load the Server app.\n\n248\n00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:12.580\nThe Server app actually has a Jabber\nserver built into it, and so\n\n249\n00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:17.340\nif I get logged into this machine here,\nand fire up my Server app.\n\n250\n00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:20.452\nWell that's different, right?\n\n251\n00:12:20.452 --> 00:12:24.303\nSo [LAUGH] I'm going to fire\nup my Server app, eventually.\n\n252\n00:12:24.303 --> 00:12:26.835\nAnd when I get into my Server app,\n\n253\n00:12:26.835 --> 00:12:31.826\nthere's actually a Messages service,\nright here, all right?\n\n254\n00:12:31.826 --> 00:12:37.364\nNow, that's not just a Mac Messages\nclient service, it's actually Jabber.\n\n255\n00:12:37.364 --> 00:12:40.942\nIn the background it's gonna run\nan open source Jabber server, and\n\n256\n00:12:40.942 --> 00:12:43.638\nI don't have to be a wizard\nto make this thing work,\n\n257\n00:12:43.638 --> 00:12:46.489\nit's just built into the system and\nit's easy to do.\n\n258\n00:12:46.489 --> 00:12:50.742\nSo I can come in here and I can say, if I\nwant to support Jabber, I can just turn it\n\n259\n00:12:50.742 --> 00:12:55.310\non, right, that's really all you have\nto do is turn the stinking thing on.\n\n260\n00:12:55.310 --> 00:12:58.470\nBut after that you choose one other\noption that's kind of important,\n\n261\n00:12:58.470 --> 00:13:00.390\nthis guy right here, Federation.\n\n262\n00:13:00.390 --> 00:13:01.585\nIf you choose Federation,\n\n263\n00:13:01.585 --> 00:13:05.298\nit's going to allow you to communicate\nwith external servers too.\n\n264\n00:13:05.298 --> 00:13:08.110\nAnd I could point to other companies,\nJabber servers, or\n\n265\n00:13:08.110 --> 00:13:11.230\neven out to some of the bigger\nones that are out there.\n\n266\n00:13:11.230 --> 00:13:14.010\nThis is gonna allow that\nInternet type communication.\n\n267\n00:13:14.010 --> 00:13:15.792\nIf you just wanted it internal,\nwe don't need that and\n\n268\n00:13:15.792 --> 00:13:18.447\nyou can turn it off, and it'll just be\npeople connected to your server, right?\n\n269\n00:13:18.447 --> 00:13:21.002\nAnd that's all I want here,\nso I'm gonna turn that off.\n\n270\n00:13:21.002 --> 00:13:24.480\nAll right so now, I've got a Jabber server\nup and running, people can connect.\n\n271\n00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:27.230\nNow, they're gonna need a user name and\na password, and so\n\n272\n00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:29.920\nI've gotta go under Users here,\nand create some accounts.\n\n273\n00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:31.850\nWell I've already got one,\nso that's convenient.\n\n274\n00:13:31.850 --> 00:13:33.780\nBut Daniel doesn't have one\nhere on this server, so\n\n275\n00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:35.500\nI'm gonna whip one up real quick.\n\n276\n00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:39.060\nSo I'll create an account for him,\nso that he'll be able to login.\n\n277\n00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:42.010\nAnd it doesn't have to match\nyour local user account.\n\n278\n00:13:42.010 --> 00:13:44.690\nIf you have Open Directory, you probably\nalready have an account here, so\n\n279\n00:13:44.690 --> 00:13:45.740\nthen it doesn't even matter.\n\n280\n00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:48.020\nYou just use the Open Directory account.\n\n281\n00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:49.970\nBut I don't have\nan Open Directory right now, so\n\n282\n00:13:49.970 --> 00:13:51.039\nI'll just create a regular old user.\n\n283\n00:13:52.510 --> 00:13:54.430\nAll right, so once that's done,\nnow I've got Daniel,\n\n284\n00:13:54.430 --> 00:13:56.830\nDon, we both got accounts\nright here on this server.\n\n285\n00:13:56.830 --> 00:14:01.160\nMessages is turned on and\nready to rock, and we should be good.\n\n286\n00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:04.940\nI can then go to my clients,\nand I can add a Jabber server.\n\n287\n00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:07.694\nApple didn't even put a dedicated\nentry here for their server,\n\n288\n00:14:07.694 --> 00:14:09.945\nbecause it's just Jabber,\nso I can choose Jabber.\n\n289\n00:14:09.945 --> 00:14:14.358\nI can put in the User Name, and\nsee the format that it wants,\n\n290\n00:14:14.358 --> 00:14:16.400\nfirst Name@ and a domain?\n\n291\n00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:19.341\nWell, that's kind of assuming that\nwe've got email addresses and\n\n292\n00:14:19.341 --> 00:14:22.160\nall that stuff assigned,\ncuz Jabber requires that.\n\n293\n00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:25.790\nAnd if I go back to my server when I\nlook at the User accounts, Don Pezet for\n\n294\n00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:29.290\nexample, I didn't attach any email\naddress, I'm not running a mail service,\n\n295\n00:14:29.290 --> 00:14:31.860\nso we really need to configure\nall of the other things.\n\n296\n00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:35.270\nI'm not really set up for that,\nso this one's gonna fail on me.\n\n297\n00:14:35.270 --> 00:14:40.000\nBut for the User Name I can just put in\nhere, let's say it's don@itpro.tv and\n\n298\n00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000\nwhatever my password happens to be.\n\n299\n00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.320\nOn the server side,\nI just need to point to the server,\n\n300\n00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:48.480\nwhich mine is called osx-server01.local.\n\n301\n00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:50.970\nYours might be called something different.\n\n302\n00:14:50.970 --> 00:14:55.656\nAnd then the Port, well, it's set to\nautomatically detect by default, and\n\n303\n00:14:55.656 --> 00:14:57.182\nyou probably want that.\n\n304\n00:14:57.182 --> 00:15:00.969\nBut on the exam, every now and then they\nask about that port number, so if they\n\n305\n00:15:00.969 --> 00:15:05.590\nrequire you to know it, there's only two\nports that you really need to remember.\n\n306\n00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:11.351\nRegular Jabber uses port 5222,\nright, 5222.\n\n307\n00:15:11.351 --> 00:15:13.440\nUnless you enable SSL.\n\n308\n00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:18.620\nIf you enable SSL it uses 5223,\njust the next one in line.\n\n309\n00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:21.290\nGood idea to remember those two numbers,\nthey can turn up on the exam.\n\n310\n00:15:21.290 --> 00:15:25.300\nBut, those are the ports\nthat it normally uses.\n\n311\n00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:28.560\nIf I leave that out, it'll auto detect,\nit'll try both, right?\n\n312\n00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:29.980\nSo you don't have to fill it in.\n\n313\n00:15:29.980 --> 00:15:33.852\nSame thing with the Server name,\nif I leave that out it'll look at my email\n\n314\n00:15:33.852 --> 00:15:37.861\naddress, and it'll try and find a Jabber\nserver registered to the domain.\n\n315\n00:15:37.861 --> 00:15:42.246\nProblem is, I don't have that domain set\nup, so there's nobody for it to look to,\n\n316\n00:15:42.246 --> 00:15:45.331\nso I might want to manually set it so\nthat doesn't happen.\n\n317\n00:15:45.331 --> 00:15:50.538\nNow, if I remember right, I don't think\nI can connect unless I actually have\n\n318\n00:15:50.538 --> 00:15:55.678\nan email address, but let's just try,\nlet's see if it'll let me Sign In.\n\n319\n00:15:55.678 --> 00:15:57.529\nSo I'm gonna try and\nsign into that server and\n\n320\n00:15:57.529 --> 00:16:00.560\nif it's successful I'll see it appear\nhere, and then it'll go active.\n\n321\n00:16:01.990 --> 00:16:07.090\nIn my case, it doesn't seem to be\ndoing much of anything, does it?\n\n322\n00:16:07.090 --> 00:16:09.830\nYeah, I'm pretty sure it's invalid,\nand so it's gonna fail out on me.\n\n323\n00:16:09.830 --> 00:16:13.050\nBut basically it would appear and\nthen we're connect up that Jabber server.\n\n324\n00:16:13.050 --> 00:16:16.450\nAnd all I have to do is go to each of my\nother machines, whether they were Macs, or\n\n325\n00:16:16.450 --> 00:16:18.070\nWindows, or whatever and get connected.\n\n326\n00:16:18.070 --> 00:16:21.318\nNow, on the Mac side we can just use the\nbuilt in Messages client, it works great,\n\n327\n00:16:21.318 --> 00:16:23.230\nyou guys have already seen that in use.\n\n328\n00:16:23.230 --> 00:16:26.590\nOn the Windows side,\nyou don't have an Apple Messages client.\n\n329\n00:16:26.590 --> 00:16:29.884\nSo on the Windows side,\nyou'd need a third-party client,\n\n330\n00:16:29.884 --> 00:16:33.967\nsomething like Trillian is a pretty\npopular one, a lot of people use that.\n\n331\n00:16:33.967 --> 00:16:39.470\nThere's, shoot, what's the one that's\na Greek letter, I never remember its name.\n\n332\n00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:42.153\nAnyhow, there's a few different\nclients that are out there,\n\n333\n00:16:42.153 --> 00:16:44.670\nTrillian is probably one\nof the more popular ones.\n\n334\n00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:46.830\nAnd you can load it up,\npoint right to the Jabber server and\n\n335\n00:16:46.830 --> 00:16:48.640\nget to chatting right away.\n\n336\n00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:51.340\nEven doing video chat, and\nthings like that, works really easy.\n\n337\n00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:56.367\nSo it doesn't have to be Mac to Mac,\nit can be Mac to something else.\n\n338\n00:16:56.367 --> 00:17:01.864\nAnd just remember that we've got Google,\nYahoo and AOL both built in.\n\n339\n00:17:01.864 --> 00:17:06.119\nBut when you go to Other, it's AOL if\nyou're running your own private AOL\n\n340\n00:17:06.119 --> 00:17:10.870\nserver, which I don't know anybody who\ndoes, but Jabber's the important one.\n\n341\n00:17:10.870 --> 00:17:17.080\nAnd with Jabber, we can connect to\na server running the OS X Server app,\n\n342\n00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:21.040\nor we can connect to any Jabber platform\nthat's out there that's supported.\n\n343\n00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:22.990\nSo, couple of neat\nthings you can do there.\n\n344\n00:17:22.990 --> 00:17:24.918\n>> Well, it's cool with having the chat.\n\n345\n00:17:24.918 --> 00:17:29.546\nYou think this, like you just talked\nabout, this is really popular kind of\n\n346\n00:17:29.546 --> 00:17:33.431\nstuff back in the late 90s and\nthroughout the 2000s really.\n\n347\n00:17:33.431 --> 00:17:34.528\nBut why would we wanna do this?\n\n348\n00:17:34.528 --> 00:17:37.500\nWell inside of an office situation,\nthey actually come in really handy and\n\n349\n00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:40.740\nI see them used a lot inside of offices.\n\n350\n00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:44.559\nSo being able to set up your users,\nregardless of whether you're using Mac or\n\n351\n00:17:44.559 --> 00:17:46.751\na Windows client, that's gonna help out.\n\n352\n00:17:46.751 --> 00:17:50.173\nCuz then you can quickly share little\ninformation, share files between each\n\n353\n00:17:50.173 --> 00:17:53.554\nother, you don't have to worry about\nnetwork shares and all of this stuff.\n\n354\n00:17:53.554 --> 00:17:55.667\nIt's a real convenience for\na lot of people, and so\n\n355\n00:17:55.667 --> 00:17:57.500\nthat's why you're still seeing it today.\n\n356\n00:17:58.580 --> 00:18:02.179\n>> Yeah, after that, once it's set up,\nit's just up and it's running, you use it,\n\n357\n00:18:02.179 --> 00:18:02.800\nit's great.\n\n358\n00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:05.330\nThere's plenty of people that are using\nthird-party systems though now.\n\n359\n00:18:05.330 --> 00:18:08.300\nThings like Slack is another\none that's pretty popular,\n\n360\n00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:09.740\ncuz you can do a lot more with it.\n\n361\n00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:14.730\nBut the service is built in, it's a way we\ncan integrate with existing services, and\n\n362\n00:18:14.730 --> 00:18:16.240\nthat's why we've got it right here.\n\n363\n00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:17.810\n>> All right, well Don,\nthank you so much for\n\n364\n00:18:17.810 --> 00:18:21.270\nexplaining how we can use these\ncommunication systems to our advantage.\n\n365\n00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:24.430\nObviously they're still\na little bit relevant for us.\n\n366\n00:18:24.430 --> 00:18:25.710\nThank you guys for watching.\n\n367\n00:18:25.710 --> 00:18:28.100\nLooks like we've wrapped up yet\nanother great episode.\n\n368\n00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:30.866\nSigning off for ITPro.TV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n369\n00:18:30.866 --> 00:18:31.740\n>> And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n370\n00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:33.803\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n371\n00:18:33.803 --> 00:18:41.309\n[SOUND]\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.628 --> 00:00:18.158\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, and\n\n4\n00:00:18.158 --> 00:00:22.040\ntoday's episode we are continuing on\nwith our Mac Integration Basics series.\n\n5\n00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.000\nJoining us back in the studio again today\nto lend his expertise on that very topic,\n\n6\n00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.930\nis our good friend, Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n7\n00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:28.340\nDon, welcome back to the show, sir.\n\n8\n00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:29.300\n>> Thanks for having me back, Daniel.\n\n9\n00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.492\nReady to jump right back into the world\nof Mac Integration Basics and\n\n10\n00:00:32.492 --> 00:00:34.738\nwe are really gonna do\nsome integration today.\n\n11\n00:00:34.738 --> 00:00:39.878\nWhat we're gonna focus on in this episode\nis migrating from Windows over to a Mac.\n\n12\n00:00:39.878 --> 00:00:42.612\nI know it's [LAUGH] it's not\nreally integration, like, hey,\n\n13\n00:00:42.612 --> 00:00:45.726\nwe could integrate with Windows, or\nwe can move away from it entirely.\n\n14\n00:00:45.726 --> 00:00:50.110\n[LAUGH] Go 100% Mac, well,\nthat certainly is an option, right?\n\n15\n00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:52.690\nAnd for a lot of people,\nthat is a direction you wanna go.\n\n16\n00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.590\nIf you've got users that are entrenched\nin the Windows environment, the Windows\n\n17\n00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:00.448\nworld, and all of a sudden you say, hey,\nhere's your new Macbook, good luck.\n\n18\n00:01:00.448 --> 00:01:03.148\nWell, there's gonna be some problems,\nthere's gonna be some growing pains.\n\n19\n00:01:03.148 --> 00:01:07.844\nAt a minimum, we've gotta be able to get\nthe data off of their Windows machine, and\n\n20\n00:01:07.844 --> 00:01:09.668\nmove it over to the Mac, right?\n\n21\n00:01:09.668 --> 00:01:13.198\nThat's at a minimum, but going beyond\nthat, there's other things, like,\n\n22\n00:01:13.198 --> 00:01:16.420\napplications that they might use on\nWindows that don't run on the Mac.\n\n23\n00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.390\nThen so, in the next couple of episodes,\nwe're gonna be taking a look\n\n24\n00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.120\nat technologies that help\nus to get around that.\n\n25\n00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:26.070\nTo help us do anything that we did\non Windows, to be able to do it\n\n26\n00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.650\nfrom within a Mac also and you'll see\nthere's some really neat technology.\n\n27\n00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.958\nSo in this episode,\nwe're gonna focus on the migration aspect.\n\n28\n00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:36.008\nHow do we get that user's data\noff of the Windows machine and\n\n29\n00:01:36.008 --> 00:01:37.628\nmove it over to the Mac?\n\n30\n00:01:37.628 --> 00:01:39.205\nAnd we can do network sharing,\n\n31\n00:01:39.205 --> 00:01:42.678\nwe can do some of the technology\nthat we've seen in other episodes.\n\n32\n00:01:42.678 --> 00:01:46.902\nBut Apple actually has a migration\nassistant that we can use that helps us to\n\n33\n00:01:46.902 --> 00:01:50.186\nget our data move over and\ni t's designed to be super easy,\n\n34\n00:01:50.186 --> 00:01:52.218\nalmost magical as Steve Jobs said.\n\n35\n00:01:52.218 --> 00:01:54.430\nAnd get that data moved over and\nhave somebody up and\n\n36\n00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.825\nrunning on a new system in short order,\nso they're not having to like, try and\n\n37\n00:01:57.825 --> 00:01:59.688\nfigure everything out right from day one.\n\n38\n00:01:59.688 --> 00:02:01.848\nWe love the people to have as good\nnew experience when they switch\n\n39\n00:02:01.848 --> 00:02:02.890\nover as possible.\n\n40\n00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.090\nAnd having all their data there is\ngonna be part of that good experience.\n\n41\n00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.570\n>> Now Don, just to make sure\nthat I'm following you correctly\n\n42\n00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:10.980\nbecause there are different\ntypes of migration.\n\n43\n00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:15.010\nWe're talking about taking someone that\nis using a PC and giving them a Mac and\n\n44\n00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.238\nwe want the data from the PC to\ngo to the new machine, right?.\n\n45\n00:02:18.238 --> 00:02:21.524\n>> Right, so say you have a Windows\nlaptop or a Windows desktop and\n\n46\n00:02:21.524 --> 00:02:23.890\nnow you're moving to an all-new computer.\n\n47\n00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.400\nYou got an all-new iMac, or\na MacBook, or something like that,\n\n48\n00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.680\nand you got two computers,\nthe old computer, and the new computer,\n\n49\n00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:31.755\nwe wanna get our data moved over.\n\n50\n00:02:31.755 --> 00:02:33.642\nNow, I'm saying Windows to Mac,\n\n51\n00:02:33.642 --> 00:02:37.688\nthe Migration Assistant we're gonna\nuse actually works Mac to Mac also.\n\n52\n00:02:37.688 --> 00:02:40.088\nThis could be,\nI've already got a Mac, right?\n\n53\n00:02:40.088 --> 00:02:41.908\nSo my laptop here, right?\n\n54\n00:02:41.908 --> 00:02:44.197\nI guess I'm only creeping up\non two years on my laptop, so\n\n55\n00:02:44.197 --> 00:02:46.170\nthis laptop's not that old.\n\n56\n00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.410\nBut if I get a new laptop,\nI need to get my data off of it, right?\n\n57\n00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.080\nAnd so, maybe,\nlike here's my laptop, right?\n\n58\n00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.449\nAnd if we look at it,\nlet's find out how old my Mac is.\n\n59\n00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:00.960\nI have a late 2013, so actually I'm\ncreeping up on three years on this thing.\n\n60\n00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.770\nAnd so, it might be about time for\nme to get a new laptop.\n\n61\n00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:08.090\nWell, for those of you that know me, I'm a\nbit of a tightwad, and so I look at it and\n\n62\n00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.730\nI'm like, well, this is an i7,\nI've got 16 gigs, I don't need to upgrade.\n\n63\n00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.740\nBut let's say I want to,\nI go out and I get a new laptop.\n\n64\n00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:18.680\nI still need to get my data off of this\nmachine and move it to the new machine.\n\n65\n00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.388\nAnd when I talk about my data,\nwhat am I talking about?\n\n66\n00:03:20.388 --> 00:03:22.576\nWell, we got our documents and\nthings like that.\n\n67\n00:03:22.576 --> 00:03:28.686\nIf I jump into my Finder, and I go into my\nDocuments, I gotta ton of stuff in here.\n\n68\n00:03:28.686 --> 00:03:33.913\nThe ISO files and other things, so\nI need to get this stuff backed up and\n\n69\n00:03:33.913 --> 00:03:38.533\nmoved over to my new Mac or\nif I've got a Windows machine like.\n\n70\n00:03:38.533 --> 00:03:41.230\n[LAUGH], this thing\na little zoomed in there.\n\n71\n00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.820\nSo here's a Windows machine and\nmaybe I've been using this and\n\n72\n00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:45.020\nI'm going crazy with it.\n\n73\n00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:46.770\nAnd I go into my documents and\n\n74\n00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:50.230\nI've got these documents that I\nneed to bring over or pictures,\n\n75\n00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.170\nI got a smiley face I made them myself,\nthat's my artistic ability there.\n\n76\n00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:57.930\nSo I got this stuff that I need to bring\nover and get onto my new computer, right?\n\n77\n00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.890\nSo Mac to Mac or Windows to Mac,\ndoesn't really matter.\n\n78\n00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:02.420\nI just need a way to move that data.\n\n79\n00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:05.060\nWell, the challenging part, and some of\nyou guys probably have been through this\n\n80\n00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:07.420\nbefore, is I could say you know what?\n\n81\n00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:11.430\nI'm just gonna take a USB key or\nmaybe like a USB hard drive like this one.\n\n82\n00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:14.430\nI'll just stick it on the side and\ncopy my data to it, right?\n\n83\n00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:15.060\nThat works.\n\n84\n00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:16.960\nYou can copy your data right to it,\n\n85\n00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:18.410\ncopy it over to your new computer and\nyou're done.\n\n86\n00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:22.590\nWell, there's some things that works\nwith it, some things that doesn't.\n\n87\n00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:25.360\nLet's say,\nthat I'm really good about saving\n\n88\n00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.710\nall of my data in my documents folder,\nright?\n\n89\n00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.150\nI can just go and copy the documents\nfolder, throw it on that USB drive,\n\n90\n00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:32.990\ngo to a new computer, and\nI've got all my data.\n\n91\n00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:36.050\nThat works great but\nwhat if I'm not so good about that?\n\n92\n00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:40.063\nWhat if I save some things to my desktop,\nsome things to the document folder,\n\n93\n00:04:40.063 --> 00:04:42.178\nsome things get saved to the root drive?\n\n94\n00:04:42.178 --> 00:04:45.056\nMy data is all over the place,\nhow do I know what to get?\n\n95\n00:04:45.056 --> 00:04:47.520\nHow do I know that I got all my data?\n\n96\n00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.690\nI don't,\nI might have left some stuff behind.\n\n97\n00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:52.840\nAnd that's a bit of a challenge we have as\nan end users, just make sure we keep our\n\n98\n00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:56.540\ndata neat and clean, and\nknowing where to go to get it, right?\n\n99\n00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:59.087\nThe other thing is there's some things\n\n100\n00:04:59.087 --> 00:05:03.498\nlike your desktop wallpaper maybe\nyou really love that wallpaper.\n\n101\n00:05:03.498 --> 00:05:05.728\nHow do I copy my wallpaper to a USB key?\n\n102\n00:05:05.728 --> 00:05:08.295\nI don't know where the wallpaper's stored,\nright?\n\n103\n00:05:08.295 --> 00:05:11.075\nOr my favorites in my web browser.\n\n104\n00:05:11.075 --> 00:05:14.319\nSo I have Internet Explorer for example,\nand I got all these favorites that I've\n\n105\n00:05:14.319 --> 00:05:17.433\nbuilt up and actually let's look at\nthis machine I'm pretty sure I got some.\n\n106\n00:05:17.433 --> 00:05:21.056\nSo if I fire up Internet Explorer and\nI go to my favorites and, yeah,\n\n107\n00:05:21.056 --> 00:05:24.826\nI've got CNN, Fox News, Roiders,\nInGadgets, Slashdot, right.\n\n108\n00:05:24.826 --> 00:05:27.944\nThese are my favorites and\nI've just got a hand full,\n\n109\n00:05:27.944 --> 00:05:31.836\non my actual computer I got I wanna\nsay at last count I broke 500.\n\n110\n00:05:31.836 --> 00:05:34.336\nI've got a ton of\nbookmarks on my computer.\n\n111\n00:05:34.336 --> 00:05:37.910\nI don't wanna lose all those,\nbut where do I go to copy those?\n\n112\n00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:41.040\nWell, maybe you know, maybe you don't,\nI do know where they are, and\n\n113\n00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:42.620\nI can go browse on the hard drive and\nget them.\n\n114\n00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:46.570\nBut when I go over to a Mac, I'm not\ngonna be running Internet Explorer, am I?\n\n115\n00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:49.390\nSo how do I get those bookmarks\nloaded back into Safari?\n\n116\n00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:51.540\nI don't know, right?\n\n117\n00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:53.520\nI gotta figure out how\nto make that happen.\n\n118\n00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:57.000\nThese are things that are challenging that\nstop people from wanting to switch, and\n\n119\n00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:57.960\nthey say, you know what?\n\n120\n00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:59.690\nForget it, I'm just gonna stay on Windows.\n\n121\n00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:02.540\nMy data's there, it's what I've got,\nI'm gonna stay with that.\n\n122\n00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:05.100\nWho cares if I'm running Windows XP and\nMicrosoft doesn't support it anymore,\n\n123\n00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:06.590\nI'm gonna stay with it, right?\n\n124\n00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:08.630\nA lot of people do that,\nbecause it's easier.\n\n125\n00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:09.870\n>> Not worth the effort for them.\n\n126\n00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:12.360\n>> That's exactly what, and\nit is a lot of effort, right?\n\n127\n00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:15.190\nSo, what Apple did is, they said,\nhow can we make this easier for people?\n\n128\n00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:16.900\nHow can we make this automatic?\n\n129\n00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:20.090\nAnd the way they did it, is with\nwhat's called the Migration Assistant.\n\n130\n00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:23.980\nThe Migration Assistant is a little\nprogram we run, and you start on your new\n\n131\n00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:27.810\ncomputer, you launch the Migration\nAssistant on your new computer.\n\n132\n00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:32.364\nAnd then it gives you instructions on how\nyou can launch the Migration Assistant on\n\n133\n00:06:32.364 --> 00:06:33.488\nyour old computer.\n\n134\n00:06:33.488 --> 00:06:35.358\nAnd so you go and\nyou run it on your old computer.\n\n135\n00:06:35.358 --> 00:06:40.378\nAnd as soon as it's running, the two see\neach other magically over the network and\n\n136\n00:06:40.378 --> 00:06:42.510\nthen they start to transmit data.\n\n137\n00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:45.690\nNow, let's throw that magic\nword away cuz it's not magic.\n\n138\n00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:49.550\nWhat it's using is the Bonjour protocol\nthat Apple distributes to build discover\n\n139\n00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:50.530\ndevices on the network.\n\n140\n00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:54.010\nAnd as soon as they discover each other,\nwhen you run that Migration Assistant,\n\n141\n00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:57.120\nit's creating an encryption key that\nallows it to talk to the other system on\n\n142\n00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:58.070\nthe other side.\n\n143\n00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:01.890\nAnd you get a secure communication over\nthe network between the two devices and\n\n144\n00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:03.950\nit transmits your data over.\n\n145\n00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:08.349\nAnd it grabs the favorites from Internet\nExplorer and it throws it in to Safari.\n\n146\n00:07:08.349 --> 00:07:11.085\nAnd it grabs the documents from\nyour folder in Windows and\n\n147\n00:07:11.085 --> 00:07:13.480\nputs them into appropriate\nplace on your new Mac.\n\n148\n00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:16.560\nOr, if you're going Mac to Mac,\nit doesn't have to translate things.\n\n149\n00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:19.030\nIt's just simple gather them and\nbring them over, and it does that.\n\n150\n00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:20.040\nIt grabs it all.\n\n151\n00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:20.680\nBrings it over.\n\n152\n00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:22.220\nPuts it in place.\n\n153\n00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:23.918\nAll right, so how does it work?\n\n154\n00:07:23.918 --> 00:07:27.060\nWell the Migration Assistant's\nactually built into Mac OS, so\n\n155\n00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:31.318\nif I go to my new Mac, so let's say here's\nmy brand new Mac, it's running El Capitan.\n\n156\n00:07:31.318 --> 00:07:35.868\nI just got it, haven't done a thing to it,\nthis is a complete stock install,\n\n157\n00:07:35.868 --> 00:07:40.490\nif I go into my Applications or\nwhatever, it's all default applications.\n\n158\n00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:44.020\nI've not customized this\nthing one single bit, right?\n\n159\n00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:45.650\nBut this if gonna be my new computer.\n\n160\n00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:48.710\nSo, maybe I come in here and\nI change its name cuz\n\n161\n00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:51.630\nI think right now it's got one\nof those auto generated names.\n\n162\n00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:52.646\nAnd yeah, it's just called Don's Mac.\n\n163\n00:07:52.646 --> 00:07:57.596\nAnd so maybe I wanna rename this and\nI'm gonna call it my OSX CLIENT01.\n\n164\n00:07:57.596 --> 00:08:00.558\nThere we go and so\nnow I've got this new computer.\n\n165\n00:08:00.558 --> 00:08:02.578\nThe only thing I've done\nis change its name.\n\n166\n00:08:02.578 --> 00:08:06.275\nAnd I'm gonna fire up my Spotlight,\nand I'm gonna search for\n\n167\n00:08:06.275 --> 00:08:07.920\nthe Migration Assistant.\n\n168\n00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:11.608\nIf you ever need to find it it's actually\nin your Applications/Utilities folder.\n\n169\n00:08:11.608 --> 00:08:14.730\nBut I'm gonna run that up, and that's\ngonna fire up the Migration Assistant.\n\n170\n00:08:14.730 --> 00:08:17.500\nNow I'm running this on my new computer.\n\n171\n00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:18.760\nNot the one that has my data,\n\n172\n00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:21.980\nthis is the one that has nothing on it,\nit's brand new, right?\n\n173\n00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:24.710\nAnd when I run it, it's gonna tell me\na little bit about what it's gonna do.\n\n174\n00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:28.530\nBut where it gets really interesting\nis when I hit Continue, it asks for\n\n175\n00:08:28.530 --> 00:08:29.920\nadministrative privileges.\n\n176\n00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:31.750\nIt needs to be an administrator so\n\n177\n00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:33.940\nthat it can access all of\nthe resources in my system.\n\n178\n00:08:35.108 --> 00:08:38.725\nAnd it's gotta make sure that\nI'm not holding any files open,\n\n179\n00:08:38.725 --> 00:08:41.740\ncuz it might have to remove\nsome things that are locked.\n\n180\n00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:45.350\nAnd so once I give it administrative\nprivileges, watch what it does.\n\n181\n00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:50.040\nI'm gonna say OK to that,\nand then it logs me out.\n\n182\n00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:53.260\nIt logged me out of the new Mac and,\n\n183\n00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:55.700\nin a second here the screen's\ngonna update, there we go.\n\n184\n00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:57.900\nAnd now I'm in the Migration Assistant.\n\n185\n00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:02.660\nTechnically we're in a single user mode\nright now, so that it can access any\n\n186\n00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:06.290\nfile on the hard drive it wants just short\nof the kernel and a few other things.\n\n187\n00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:10.079\nAnd so that it can grab favorites,\nwallpaper, documents, folders,\n\n188\n00:09:10.079 --> 00:09:12.428\nall those other things, and bring them in.\n\n189\n00:09:12.428 --> 00:09:15.830\nAnd it's not gonna have a conflict\nwhere a file's open, or being read, or\n\n190\n00:09:15.830 --> 00:09:17.420\nwritten to, or whatever.\n\n191\n00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:20.760\nNow it's nice and clean, but it means\nthat I can't use this computer anymore.\n\n192\n00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:23.420\nThat I'm now in the Migration Assistant,\nthe computer's locked.\n\n193\n00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:26.420\nI have to quit out of the Migration\nAssistant if I wanna start using it\n\n194\n00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:28.850\nas a regular computer again, all right?\n\n195\n00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:32.900\nOnce I'm in here it's gonna\nask me what I'm doing, right?\n\n196\n00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:36.720\nAm I migrating from a Mac,\na Time Machine backup, or\n\n197\n00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:38.760\na start up disk, and\nbringing it to this system?\n\n198\n00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:40.760\nIn other words, is this one the target?\n\n199\n00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:43.228\nAm I migrating from a Windows machine?\n\n200\n00:09:43.228 --> 00:09:46.240\nAnd again, this one is the target,\nthe Windows machine is the source.\n\n201\n00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:47.720\nOr am I migrating to another Mac?\n\n202\n00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:50.250\nIn other words, this one's the source, and\n\n203\n00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:53.030\nthere's another Mac somewhere\nelse that's gonna be my target.\n\n204\n00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:58.850\nSo the first two are from, from a Mac,\nfrom a Windows machine, we're the target.\n\n205\n00:09:58.850 --> 00:10:03.610\nThe last one is to another machine,\nwe're the source.\n\n206\n00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:04.950\nWhy is that important?\n\n207\n00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:09.660\nWell if I'm migrating Mac to Mac,\nthen I'm gonna choose this first option.\n\n208\n00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:13.040\nI'm migrating from a Mac\non my new machine.\n\n209\n00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:16.940\nAnd on my old machine, I'm gonna\nlaunch the Migration Assistant, and\n\n210\n00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:18.830\nI'm gonna choose to another Mac.\n\n211\n00:10:18.830 --> 00:10:21.550\nI'm gonna choose the other direction,\nand the two\n\n212\n00:10:21.550 --> 00:10:25.710\nwill find each other on the network, and\nit's gonna move that data over, right?\n\n213\n00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:29.360\nBut it doesn't necessarily have\nto be an online machine, right?\n\n214\n00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:32.750\nWe're assuming the two machines are online\nand I've got access to both of them.\n\n215\n00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:36.900\nMaybe the reason I'm doing this migration\nis because I lost my laptop and\n\n216\n00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:38.070\nit's gone, right?\n\n217\n00:10:39.130 --> 00:10:42.500\nOr it's got a bad hard drive and it died.\n\n218\n00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:44.920\nSo the machine died and\nI just bought a new computer.\n\n219\n00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:46.485\nWell instead of moving from a Mac,\n\n220\n00:10:46.485 --> 00:10:50.820\ncuz the Mac's offline,\nI can use a time machine backup instead.\n\n221\n00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:53.758\nSo I can take a Time Machine backup and\nhook it up, and migrate the data in.\n\n222\n00:10:53.758 --> 00:10:55.142\nNow you may be asking yourself,\n\n223\n00:10:55.142 --> 00:10:58.113\nwell wait a minute, Don, if I have\na Time Machine back up, why don't\n\n224\n00:10:58.113 --> 00:11:01.600\nI just restore the Time Machine back up\nto the system and then be done with it?\n\n225\n00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:03.170\nWell you certainly can do that.\n\n226\n00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:06.720\nBut what if your new Mac\nis running El Capitan, and\n\n227\n00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:11.590\nyour Time Machine backup is Yosemite,\nor Mavericks, or Snow Leopard?\n\n228\n00:11:11.590 --> 00:11:14.100\nI mean,\nit can be something ancient, right?\n\n229\n00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:16.690\nPink Bunnies,\n[LAUGH] whatever old OS you're running.\n\n230\n00:11:16.690 --> 00:11:21.850\nSo you can have an older OS on that\nTime Machine backup, and it'll just\n\n231\n00:11:21.850 --> 00:11:25.760\nmigrate your data, and bring your data in,\nand now you're running El Capitan.\n\n232\n00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:30.250\nVersus if I restore the Time Machine\nbackup, it's gonna restore me to whatever\n\n233\n00:11:30.250 --> 00:11:33.840\nversion operating system that Time Machine\nbackup had, and that can be problematic.\n\n234\n00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:36.230\nEspecially if you're moving\nbetween hardware, right?\n\n235\n00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:41.800\nMaybe the backup is from a Mac Mini, and\nI'm about to restore it to a MacBook Pro.\n\n236\n00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:44.430\nNow there's a little bit of a difference\nin that hardware, we're going from\n\n237\n00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:47.070\na desktop to a laptop, and that Time\nMachine backup can cause some problems.\n\n238\n00:11:47.070 --> 00:11:49.850\nSo using the Migration Assistant\nensures that I get\n\n239\n00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:54.190\nall the custom settings of the new system,\nbut all my data from the old system,\n\n240\n00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:56.230\nwhich is really important, all right?\n\n241\n00:11:56.230 --> 00:11:58.940\nThe last option here is,\nor a startup disk.\n\n242\n00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:00.450\nWhat the heck is that all about?\n\n243\n00:12:00.450 --> 00:12:02.220\nThe startup disk is\nthe disk I booted off of,\n\n244\n00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:04.700\nwhy would I wanna migrate\nfrom my own startup disk?\n\n245\n00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:07.400\nAnd the answer is you wouldn't, right?\n\n246\n00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:11.518\nBut let's say that maybe\nDaniel comes to me one day.\n\n247\n00:12:11.518 --> 00:12:16.168\nAnd he's like, hey Don, the display on my\nlaptop has died, I can't see my laptop.\n\n248\n00:12:16.168 --> 00:12:18.018\nAnd I say okay,\nwell I got another laptop here,\n\n249\n00:12:18.018 --> 00:12:20.310\nlet's just move you over to this one,\nright?\n\n250\n00:12:20.310 --> 00:12:21.756\nI could take his laptop and\n\n251\n00:12:21.756 --> 00:12:24.858\nboot it while holding the T\nkey to boot it in target mode.\n\n252\n00:12:24.858 --> 00:12:27.186\nAnd then I could hook it\nup to the new laptop and\n\n253\n00:12:27.186 --> 00:12:30.050\nit would just show up\nas another hard drive.\n\n254\n00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:33.118\nAnd I could say,\nlet's migrate from a startup disk.\n\n255\n00:12:33.118 --> 00:12:36.290\nAnd it would see that disk of his and\nmigrate it in.\n\n256\n00:12:36.290 --> 00:12:39.110\nSo I could actually use his computer,\nphysically attached to mine,\n\n257\n00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:39.990\nto migrate it in.\n\n258\n00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:42.091\nI would need physical\naccess to that system,\n\n259\n00:12:42.091 --> 00:12:46.086\nwhich I guess you're gonna really need\nanyway, but that's the third option there.\n\n260\n00:12:46.086 --> 00:12:49.406\nAll right, now in my case though,\nI'm not migrating from a Mac.\n\n261\n00:12:49.406 --> 00:12:50.800\nI'm gonna migrate from Windows.\n\n262\n00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:55.670\nI've got this Windows machine over here\nthat has my Internet Explorer favorites,\n\n263\n00:12:55.670 --> 00:13:01.100\nit's got this crazy windows wallpaper\nthat actually won't migrate over.\n\n264\n00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:01.940\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] But yeah,\n\n265\n00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:05.270\nApple doesn't like to migrate\nthe default Windows wallpaper over.\n\n266\n00:13:05.270 --> 00:13:08.110\nThey'll do custom ones, but not that one.\n\n267\n00:13:08.110 --> 00:13:12.180\nIf I go into my Documents, here's some\ndocuments that I've got, a form letter,\n\n268\n00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:14.560\na resume, gotta have a resume right?\n\n269\n00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:16.600\nSo it's got those things,\nit's got some pictures.\n\n270\n00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:19.830\nAll this stuff is gonna\ncome over to my new system.\n\n271\n00:13:19.830 --> 00:13:21.770\nAnd on my new system I don't\nhave any of that data yet.\n\n272\n00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:26.420\nSo my wizard here, I'm just gonna tell\nit I'm migrating from a Windows machine.\n\n273\n00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:29.570\nSo my source is Windows,\nand I'm going to a Mac.\n\n274\n00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:34.240\nNow when I continue,\nthe Mac already has everything it needs.\n\n275\n00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:38.520\nIt's got the Migration Assistant, and now\nit's ready to pair up with somebody else.\n\n276\n00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:42.050\nAnd it tells me it's looking for a source.\n\n277\n00:13:42.050 --> 00:13:45.460\nIt's looking for a Windows machine running\nthe Migration Assistant, all right?\n\n278\n00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:47.550\nSo, that's my next step,\ncuz I need to go to the Windows machine.\n\n279\n00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:50.910\nThe problem is Microsoft,\nI don't understand why, but\n\n280\n00:13:50.910 --> 00:13:54.260\nMicrosoft does not package Apple's\nMigration Assistant with their software.\n\n281\n00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:55.490\n>> Well, that's just crazy talk,\nDon [LAUGH].\n\n282\n00:13:55.490 --> 00:13:58.590\n>> I know, it's almost like they don't\nwant people to switch from Windows.\n\n283\n00:13:58.590 --> 00:14:00.500\nI guess that's some business decision.\n\n284\n00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:03.920\nSo we need to get the Migration Assistant\nloaded on the Windows machine.\n\n285\n00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:05.700\nAnd so that's what it's telling\nme here on this screen,\n\n286\n00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:07.460\nright down here at the bottom.\n\n287\n00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:11.706\nDownload and run the Migration Assistant\napp on your Windows PC from, and\n\n288\n00:14:11.706 --> 00:14:15.131\nit gives me the URL,\napple.com/migrate-to-mac, and\n\n289\n00:14:15.131 --> 00:14:18.708\nthat where we can pull the utility,\ndownload and install it.\n\n290\n00:14:18.708 --> 00:14:22.690\nSo I'm gonna jump over to that Windows\nmachine, and I'm gonna do exactly that.\n\n291\n00:14:22.690 --> 00:14:27.086\nI'm gonna fire up Internet Explorer and\n\n292\n00:14:27.086 --> 00:14:33.810\nI'm gonna browse to\nwww.apple.com/migrate-to-mac,\n\n293\n00:14:33.810 --> 00:14:36.146\nand we'll run that.\n\n294\n00:14:36.146 --> 00:14:40.670\nAnd here we go, the Windows Migration\nAssistant, version 1.0.5.7.\n\n295\n00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:42.650\nThat is actually kind of important.\n\n296\n00:14:42.650 --> 00:14:46.685\nWhenever a new version of Windows comes\nout, Apple has to upgrade this Assistant,\n\n297\n00:14:46.685 --> 00:14:49.140\nand so they update it and\nthey put out a new version.\n\n298\n00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:51.678\nAnd every time a new version\nof Mac OS comes out.\n\n299\n00:14:51.678 --> 00:14:55.017\nSo when El Capitan came out, for example,\nthey had update this Assistant so\n\n300\n00:14:55.017 --> 00:14:57.410\nthat it would be able to\ncommunicate properly.\n\n301\n00:14:57.410 --> 00:14:59.540\nSo always make sure you're\nusing the latest version, and\n\n302\n00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:02.490\njumping right to this website is\nthe great way to do it, all right?\n\n303\n00:15:02.490 --> 00:15:05.955\nAnd then down here it tells us it'll\nlet us migrate from Windows PCs running\n\n304\n00:15:05.955 --> 00:15:08.168\nWindows XP, Vista, Windows 7 or Windows 8.\n\n305\n00:15:08.168 --> 00:15:12.240\nWait a minute, I'm running Windows 10,\nis that gonna be a problem?\n\n306\n00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:13.640\nWell it actually will work,\n\n307\n00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:17.680\nbut the main thing is they just haven't\ndirectly supported Windows 10 yet.\n\n308\n00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:20.650\nApple has started supporting Windows\n10 with Boot Camp, for example.\n\n309\n00:15:20.650 --> 00:15:23.260\nBut they've been a little slow to pick\nit up here with the Migration Assistant.\n\n310\n00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:24.030\nBut it'll still work.\n\n311\n00:15:24.030 --> 00:15:26.695\n>> So if this doesn't work, they've\ntold you it's not their fault [LAUGH].\n\n312\n00:15:26.695 --> 00:15:28.420\n>> [LAUGH] That's basically it.\n\n313\n00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:31.170\nSo I'm going to go ahead and download this\nAssistant, and so I'll click on that.\n\n314\n00:15:31.170 --> 00:15:33.030\nIt's gonna download, and I'll just run it.\n\n315\n00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:36.460\nThe install is really straightforward,\nwe basically just click Next a few times.\n\n316\n00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:39.200\nSo here it is, we get a little\nwelcome screen, and like I said,\n\n317\n00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:41.338\nI'm gonna click Next,\nit's really challenging.\n\n318\n00:15:41.338 --> 00:15:46.670\nI'll accept their license agreement, we'll\nhit Install, and there it goes installing.\n\n319\n00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:50.180\nAnd it went by really fast, but for those\nof you that were sharp-eyed you might have\n\n320\n00:15:50.180 --> 00:15:51.998\nnoticed that it said Installing Bonjour.\n\n321\n00:15:51.998 --> 00:15:54.264\nIt was adding that Apple Bonjour protocol,\n\n322\n00:15:54.264 --> 00:15:57.142\nwhich is the discovery protocol\nwe used on the network so\n\n323\n00:15:57.142 --> 00:16:01.138\nthat this Windows machine will be able\nto find The Mac that's on the network.\n\n324\n00:16:01.138 --> 00:16:04.040\nAnd so when it's done, it's gonna run.\n\n325\n00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:09.210\nThere we go, it's starting to run\nin the background, and, shoot,\n\n326\n00:16:09.210 --> 00:16:11.510\napparently it needs the .NET framework so\nit's gonna have to download and\n\n327\n00:16:11.510 --> 00:16:13.270\ninstall that, so we'll let it do that.\n\n328\n00:16:13.270 --> 00:16:17.830\nSo it's gonna run and once it comes up\nIt's gonna start scanning the network and\n\n329\n00:16:17.830 --> 00:16:19.520\nit's gonna see the other Mac.\n\n330\n00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:23.820\nIt's gonna spot it and then we're gonna be\nable to communicate and exchange our data.\n\n331\n00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:27.170\nNow it needed the .NET Framework on\nWindows because this was a pretty\n\n332\n00:16:27.170 --> 00:16:27.790\nclean install.\n\n333\n00:16:27.790 --> 00:16:30.930\nSo its installing that for me right now,\nthey're trying to make it easy but\n\n334\n00:16:30.930 --> 00:16:33.920\nsometimes you have extra requirements so\nits just gonna install that.\n\n335\n00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:37.190\nA lot of Windows machines will\nalready have the .NET Framework and so\n\n336\n00:16:37.190 --> 00:16:38.960\nwe're not gonna have to worry about that.\n\n337\n00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:40.330\nBut in my case I didn't have it.\n\n338\n00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:43.755\n>> I've always found it interesting that\nall versions of Windows aren't coming\n\n339\n00:16:43.755 --> 00:16:47.050\npre-installed with whatever\nlatest version of .NET,\n\n340\n00:16:47.050 --> 00:16:51.410\nplus all the priors, because\neverything uses a .NET Framework, so.\n\n341\n00:16:51.410 --> 00:16:52.705\nNo wonder we're migrating.\n\n342\n00:16:52.705 --> 00:16:54.840\n[LAUGH]\n>> That one's really Microsoft's fault.\n\n343\n00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:56.720\n>> Yeah.\n>> Because the .NET Frameworks are not\n\n344\n00:16:56.720 --> 00:17:00.360\ncompatible with each other, so if you\nhave version 3 that's different from 3.5\n\n345\n00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:04.150\nwhich is different than 4 and you end\nup having to have a bunch of them so.\n\n346\n00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:05.630\nAnyhow, it installs pretty quick and\n\n347\n00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:08.420\nas soon as it's done,\nwe're gonna launch this wizard.\n\n348\n00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:11.030\nThere we go, it just finished,\nof course, I need to reboot.\n\n349\n00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:15.230\nSo we'll go ahead and\nhit close on that and we'll let it reboot.\n\n350\n00:17:15.230 --> 00:17:19.580\nNow once it reboots what it's done is\nis it's added the migration assistant.\n\n351\n00:17:19.580 --> 00:17:23.180\nAnd so, if I search my start\nmenu it will turn up eventually.\n\n352\n00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:25.910\nBut the migration assistant\nis now installed and\n\n353\n00:17:25.910 --> 00:17:29.730\nI'll have that available to be\nable to run and get connected.\n\n354\n00:17:29.730 --> 00:17:32.600\nSo, let me just give this\nguy a reboot real quick.\n\n355\n00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:34.330\nIt seems to be done.\n\n356\n00:17:34.330 --> 00:17:37.030\nAnd then as soon as we're rebooted,\nthen we'll launch in and\n\n357\n00:17:37.030 --> 00:17:39.340\nwe'll have some fun with this\nthing migrating it over.\n\n358\n00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:42.450\nNow back over here, my Mac it's still just\nsitting here saying, looking for source.\n\n359\n00:17:42.450 --> 00:17:43.340\nIt's gonna keep doing that.\n\n360\n00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:45.240\nIt's waiting for a computer to come up.\n\n361\n00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:47.780\nAnd one question I get from people is,\n\n362\n00:17:47.780 --> 00:17:52.420\nwell Don, what if somebody's kinda\nbeing malicious, like a hacker type?\n\n363\n00:17:52.420 --> 00:17:55.100\nAnd they fire up a computer and\nthey launch the migration assistant and\n\n364\n00:17:55.100 --> 00:17:56.550\nthey just sit there and wait?\n\n365\n00:17:56.550 --> 00:17:57.540\nRight?\nYou just let it run on\n\n366\n00:17:57.540 --> 00:17:58.720\nthe network all the time.\n\n367\n00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:01.330\nAnd then I go to migrate\nmy Windows machine and\n\n368\n00:18:01.330 --> 00:18:04.060\nit connects to the hacker instead of me,\nright?\n\n369\n00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:08.430\nAnd now I'm sending all of my data over to\nthis hacker and I just lost all my data.\n\n370\n00:18:08.430 --> 00:18:10.450\nI gave it up to somebody else, right?\n\n371\n00:18:10.450 --> 00:18:13.220\nWell as soon as these two\nmachines see each other.\n\n372\n00:18:13.220 --> 00:18:16.560\nIts gonna generate a code,\na code number, like a password.\n\n373\n00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:18.170\nNow I've got to enter that\nin on the other side too.\n\n374\n00:18:18.170 --> 00:18:19.550\nThat's going to serve as\nthe encryption key for\n\n375\n00:18:19.550 --> 00:18:21.990\nthese sessions to be allowing\nthem to communicate.\n\n376\n00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:23.210\nThat's how we get that protection.\n\n377\n00:18:23.210 --> 00:18:25.680\nSo you don't have to worry about\nsending your data to the wrong machine.\n\n378\n00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:29.570\nIt actually does have logic\nin place to pick that up and\n\n379\n00:18:29.570 --> 00:18:33.100\nstop us from sending our\ndata to the wrong person.\n\n380\n00:18:34.550 --> 00:18:36.030\nAll right, so\nmy machine just finished rebooting.\n\n381\n00:18:36.030 --> 00:18:37.780\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nget logged into it and\n\n382\n00:18:37.780 --> 00:18:39.820\nthen we'll get a chance to\nstart the migration assistant.\n\n383\n00:18:41.410 --> 00:18:45.200\nAll right, so I'm just gonna fire up old\nstart menu and actually I can see right\n\n384\n00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:48.780\nhere in my recently added that I now\nhave the Windows Migration Assistant.\n\n385\n00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:51.980\nAnd I know it says the Windows Migration\nAssistant but if you look at the icon.\n\n386\n00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:54.980\nThere's the old Mac OS icon\nright from way back in the day.\n\n387\n00:18:54.980 --> 00:18:58.140\nSo I'm gonna click on that and it's\ngonna launch that migration assistant.\n\n388\n00:18:58.140 --> 00:19:00.620\nSo here it goes starting up, and\n\n389\n00:19:00.620 --> 00:19:03.840\nit's gonna leverage Bonjour\nto scan the network.\n\n390\n00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:07.960\nAnd see that I've got a Mac sitting\nout there ready for this migration and\n\n391\n00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:10.240\nthen it's gonna start that process.\n\n392\n00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:13.183\nAll right, and yeah, it looks like\npatience is the secret sauce on this one,\n\n393\n00:19:13.183 --> 00:19:15.904\nso the Migration Assistant just came\nup and I've got that assistant and\n\n394\n00:19:15.904 --> 00:19:17.922\nit's gonna start walking\nme through that process.\n\n395\n00:19:17.922 --> 00:19:20.487\nSo here it's got,\nto begin, click Continue.\n\n396\n00:19:20.487 --> 00:19:21.955\nI guess we'll go ahead and do that, and\n\n397\n00:19:21.955 --> 00:19:24.583\nit's gonna let me know that\nWindows Updates are configured to install\n\n398\n00:19:24.583 --> 00:19:25.500\nautomatically.\n\n399\n00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:27.760\nTo avoid interrupting\nthe migration process,\n\n400\n00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:30.060\ndisable automatic installation of updates.\n\n401\n00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:33.730\nThe reason there is If an update\napplies from Microsoft it might reboot\n\n402\n00:19:33.730 --> 00:19:36.460\nthe computer, and it might reboot in\nthe middle of a Migration Assistant.\n\n403\n00:19:36.460 --> 00:19:39.350\nNow if you've got a lot of data\nthat's a very real problem.\n\n404\n00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:43.645\nIf you just have a little data like I do,\nthe odds of that happening are pretty low.\n\n405\n00:19:43.645 --> 00:19:46.294\nIt's up to you, you can go and disable\nthose automatic updates if you want.\n\n406\n00:19:46.294 --> 00:19:47.853\nI'm gonna leave mine be.\n\n407\n00:19:47.853 --> 00:19:49.370\nAnd then, here it's searching.\n\n408\n00:19:49.370 --> 00:19:51.510\nSee how it says waiting for\na Mac to connect?\n\n409\n00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:53.930\nSo it's looking at the network,\nit's scanning and\n\n410\n00:19:53.930 --> 00:19:55.650\ntrying to find a Mac that's out there.\n\n411\n00:19:55.650 --> 00:19:59.180\nAnd if I jump over to my Mac,\nwell it says looking for\n\n412\n00:19:59.180 --> 00:20:02.140\nother sources, WIN-CLIENT01 is right here.\n\n413\n00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:03.310\nAnd if I click on that one,\n\n414\n00:20:05.140 --> 00:20:08.340\nit's asking me to select a Windows PC to\ntransfer this information to the Mac.\n\n415\n00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:11.220\nI can choose it, and\nit's still reaching out and communicating.\n\n416\n00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:15.140\nBut I've now selected that node and\nback over here they're\n\n417\n00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:19.510\ngoing to start communicating and\nstart to kick us in that process.\n\n418\n00:20:19.510 --> 00:20:22.180\nNow it is taking it\na moment to communicate.\n\n419\n00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:23.630\nLets see what's going on there.\n\n420\n00:20:23.630 --> 00:20:26.620\nI know they're able to see each other\nbecause the client does show up here\n\n421\n00:20:26.620 --> 00:20:27.830\nthat's a good sign.\n\n422\n00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:31.030\nNow we just need to give it\na moment to make itself happy.\n\n423\n00:20:31.030 --> 00:20:33.121\nYou know actually I think I did continue.\n\n424\n00:20:33.121 --> 00:20:33.630\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n425\n00:20:33.630 --> 00:20:34.750\n>> So if I choose the client and\n\n426\n00:20:34.750 --> 00:20:36.520\nhit continue, there we go.\n\n427\n00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:37.880\nNow the code I was talking about.\n\n428\n00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:38.916\nGlad we didn't wait too long on that one.\n\n429\n00:20:38.916 --> 00:20:42.494\n>> [LAUGH] Wait for\nDon to stop being a moron.\n\n430\n00:20:42.494 --> 00:20:45.390\nSo anyhow, I've got a code here 492451.\n\n431\n00:20:45.390 --> 00:20:49.448\nI'm gonna jump over to\nthe Windows machine, 492451.\n\n432\n00:20:49.448 --> 00:20:51.059\nI need to make sure those match.\n\n433\n00:20:51.059 --> 00:20:54.333\nIf they don't match, I could have\nconnected to a hacker's machine,\n\n434\n00:20:54.333 --> 00:20:56.340\nnot necessarily super malicious hacker.\n\n435\n00:20:56.340 --> 00:20:59.370\nMaybe just somebody else's,\nthis is how I tell the difference, right?\n\n436\n00:20:59.370 --> 00:21:01.330\nHow do I know I'm sending\nthe data to the right place?\n\n437\n00:21:01.330 --> 00:21:03.970\nAs long as the numbers match,\nthen we can hit continue.\n\n438\n00:21:03.970 --> 00:21:06.370\nAnd notice,\nI can't hit continue here on the Mac.\n\n439\n00:21:06.370 --> 00:21:07.510\nit's grayed out.\n\n440\n00:21:07.510 --> 00:21:09.020\nI have to hit it on the Windows side.\n\n441\n00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:10.180\nThe numbers match.\n\n442\n00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:11.420\nI'm gonna hit continue.\n\n443\n00:21:11.420 --> 00:21:13.550\nAnd now it's gonna start\nmigrating my data.\n\n444\n00:21:13.550 --> 00:21:14.870\nIt's gathering up.\n\n445\n00:21:14.870 --> 00:21:15.540\nThe documents.\n\n446\n00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:16.640\nMy documents folder.\n\n447\n00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:18.340\nThe favorites from Internet Explorer.\n\n448\n00:21:18.340 --> 00:21:20.170\nThe other custom settings that I've got.\n\n449\n00:21:20.170 --> 00:21:22.050\nIt's gathering that data and\n\n450\n00:21:22.050 --> 00:21:26.580\ncopying it over the network\nto the Mac on the other side.\n\n451\n00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:29.890\nAnd so over here,\nit's gonna see all that data.\n\n452\n00:21:29.890 --> 00:21:32.280\nAnd now I can pick and choose what I want.\n\n453\n00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:35.010\nAnd so looking at here,\nit's gonna migrate over user accounts.\n\n454\n00:21:35.010 --> 00:21:37.170\nIf I've got more than one user,\nI can pick and\n\n455\n00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:39.660\nhere it says this user needs\nattention before migrating.\n\n456\n00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:41.030\nI wonder what's going on there.\n\n457\n00:21:41.030 --> 00:21:43.400\nLooks like we've got some conflicts.\n\n458\n00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:45.960\nI've got a conflict cuz I've already\ngot a user account called Don Pezet on\n\n459\n00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:47.190\nthis computer.\n\n460\n00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:49.780\nAnd the account on the old\ncomputer is called Don Pezet, so\n\n461\n00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:50.980\nthere's a conflict in names.\n\n462\n00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:52.680\nThat's why it's telling me\nit's got a problem there.\n\n463\n00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:53.820\nI probably shouldn't have done that.\n\n464\n00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:57.180\nBut you'll see all the things that it's\ngonna bring over, Music, Pictures, Movie,\n\n465\n00:21:57.180 --> 00:22:01.839\nDesktop, Downloads, Documents,\nmy OneDrive, if anybody uses that.\n\n466\n00:22:01.839 --> 00:22:05.630\nThere's my Bookmarks, and\nC OS showing Safari bookmarks,\n\n467\n00:22:05.630 --> 00:22:08.960\nthey're actually Internet Explorer but\nit's gonna bring them in to Safari.\n\n468\n00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:13.080\nAnd it's gonna get other files, Shared\nFiles, Performance Logs, Other Documents.\n\n469\n00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:14.330\nThis is gonna scan my hard drive and\nlook for\n\n470\n00:22:14.330 --> 00:22:16.575\ndocuments that I might have missed it,\nmissed.\n\n471\n00:22:16.575 --> 00:22:19.200\n[LAUGH] If I pretend to speak English,\nI guess.\n\n472\n00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:19.960\nSo there we go.\n\n473\n00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:21.560\nSo that's basically what it's gonna do.\n\n474\n00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:23.580\nIt's gonna bring all\nthat information over.\n\n475\n00:22:23.580 --> 00:22:26.470\nAnd if I move forward, here's the problem.\n\n476\n00:22:26.470 --> 00:22:30.200\nIt's saying, here look, you've already\ngot a user account called Don Pezet,\n\n477\n00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:32.370\nwe're about to bump it.\n\n478\n00:22:32.370 --> 00:22:36.200\nAnd I could replace it,\nexcept that's my admin account so\n\n479\n00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:37.460\nit won't let me replace it.\n\n480\n00:22:37.460 --> 00:22:38.110\nNormally I would do that.\n\n481\n00:22:38.110 --> 00:22:40.190\nSo I'm just gonna give it a new name.\n\n482\n00:22:40.190 --> 00:22:42.964\nYou know,\nmaybe we'll just say like Daniel Lowrie.\n\n483\n00:22:42.964 --> 00:22:46.680\nSo, that's gonna be the new\nAccount that it makes.\n\n484\n00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:49.470\nIdeally I shouldn't have created\nan account called Don Pezet on the new\n\n485\n00:22:49.470 --> 00:22:50.690\nmachine already.\n\n486\n00:22:50.690 --> 00:22:52.310\nAll right, so I've got that set,\nI'll go ahead and\n\n487\n00:22:52.310 --> 00:22:56.500\nhit continue, and now it's gonna bring\nthat one over under the new name.\n\n488\n00:22:56.500 --> 00:22:59.880\nI've got no red flags, and\nnow it's importing that data.\n\n489\n00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:01.570\nIt's dragging it from\nthe client over to the Mac.\n\n490\n00:23:01.570 --> 00:23:05.120\nNow I've got a pretty small set of data so\nthis should happen pretty quickly.\n\n491\n00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:08.570\nIf you have a large set of data though,\nyou've got a huge MP3 collection or\n\n492\n00:23:08.570 --> 00:23:13.150\nan iTunes library, you just have a ton\nof pictures, this could take an hour, or\n\n493\n00:23:13.150 --> 00:23:14.260\nit could take two hours.\n\n494\n00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:16.180\nIt also depends on\nthe speed of your network.\n\n495\n00:23:16.180 --> 00:23:19.120\nI'm on a wired network here,\nyou might be on a wireless network.\n\n496\n00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:21.700\nAnd over a wireless network\nit's gonna take longer also.\n\n497\n00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:24.970\nBut it's important that information\non the Windows machine, let\n\n498\n00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:29.738\nme check with the compatibility message\nthere which I might crashed out actually.\n\n499\n00:23:29.738 --> 00:23:30.630\nSo [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n500\n00:23:30.630 --> 00:23:31.910\n>> So, they crashed out and\n\n501\n00:23:31.910 --> 00:23:35.730\nobviously it might gonna migrate very,\nvery fast and no over here,\n\n502\n00:23:35.730 --> 00:23:40.250\nlooks like we're done if I,\npatience is my mortal enemy today.\n\n503\n00:23:40.250 --> 00:23:42.870\nSo, let's try migration is completed,\nit didn't crashed out so, it's done,\n\n504\n00:23:42.870 --> 00:23:45.390\nI'm gonna go ahead and quit that wizard.\n\n505\n00:23:45.390 --> 00:23:47.100\nHow do I know it's done?\n\n506\n00:23:47.100 --> 00:23:50.628\nWell, if it's done, I should have a user\naccount called Daniel Lowrie, and\n\n507\n00:23:50.628 --> 00:23:51.949\nsure enough, I do, right?\n\n508\n00:23:51.949 --> 00:23:55.921\nThat's the one, cuz I chose to rename\nthe account when I brought it over, and\n\n509\n00:23:55.921 --> 00:23:59.608\nif I click on that to login, the first\nthing I get is reset the password.\n\n510\n00:23:59.608 --> 00:24:01.858\nMicrosoft doesn't allow\nexporting your password.\n\n511\n00:24:01.858 --> 00:24:03.578\nSo I've gotta pick a new password for\nthat user.\n\n512\n00:24:03.578 --> 00:24:07.270\nAnd that's fine,\nit's fine if I can type it.\n\n513\n00:24:07.270 --> 00:24:10.910\nLet me jut try and\ndo that again, there we go.\n\n514\n00:24:10.910 --> 00:24:14.380\nSo I'll punch in a password for\nthe user, and I'm gonna reset it, so\n\n515\n00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:16.360\nthis is the first time I'm logging in.\n\n516\n00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:19.980\nAnd now when I log in,\nI'm gonna get his system.\n\n517\n00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:22.220\nAnd it's the new Mac.\n\n518\n00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:25.360\nBut all my documents, my favorites,\nthose other things, should be there.\n\n519\n00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:26.910\nAnd we should see that here in a moment.\n\n520\n00:24:26.910 --> 00:24:28.440\nIt's gonna offer for\nme to sign in with an Apple ID.\n\n521\n00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:30.010\nI'll take a pass on that.\n\n522\n00:24:30.010 --> 00:24:30.810\n>> James, in our chat room,\n\n523\n00:24:30.810 --> 00:24:34.430\nhe actually offers a little word of\nadvice if you're doing migrations.\n\n524\n00:24:34.430 --> 00:24:38.799\nConsistency is the key here because he\nsays he always keeps his old machine on\n\n525\n00:24:38.799 --> 00:24:41.200\nthe left and the new machine on the right.\n\n526\n00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:42.672\nThat way he doesn't get confused.\n\n527\n00:24:42.672 --> 00:24:43.704\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Is this the new machine,\n\n528\n00:24:43.704 --> 00:24:44.690\nis that the old machine?\n\n529\n00:24:44.690 --> 00:24:46.290\nAnd then you're migrating the wrong way.\n\n530\n00:24:46.290 --> 00:24:48.100\nThat's a bad thing, don't wanna do that.\n\n531\n00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:51.030\nThat little consistency tip right\nthere will help keep you out of that\n\n532\n00:24:51.030 --> 00:24:51.980\ndangerous water.\n\n533\n00:24:51.980 --> 00:24:53.011\n>> Absolutely.\n\n534\n00:24:53.011 --> 00:24:56.769\nAll right, now looking at mine, I didn't\nget my fancy Windows wallpaper, but\n\n535\n00:24:56.769 --> 00:25:00.640\nlike I said, Apple doesn't like the bring\nthe Microsoft Windows [LAUGH] wallpaper\n\n536\n00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:02.848\nover into the Mac, so\nI kind of expected that.\n\n537\n00:25:02.848 --> 00:25:06.180\nYeah, yeah, that's stupid smoky window or\nwhatever that thing is.\n\n538\n00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:07.417\nI don't even know.\n\n539\n00:25:07.417 --> 00:25:10.468\nBut looking at the desktop here,\nhow do I know my data came over?\n\n540\n00:25:10.468 --> 00:25:14.518\nWell, if I fire up Safari,\nlet's see if I have my favorites, right?\n\n541\n00:25:14.518 --> 00:25:18.196\nSo if I go into my bookmarks in Safari,\nam I gonna have those?\n\n542\n00:25:18.196 --> 00:25:20.558\nWell, I've got a nice\nlittle folder right here,\n\n543\n00:25:20.558 --> 00:25:23.145\nMigrated from Internet Explorer,\nand there's CNN,\n\n544\n00:25:23.145 --> 00:25:27.500\nEngadget, FOX News, and all the other guys\nright here, they've been brought over.\n\n545\n00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:30.730\nSo I can jump right into Slashdot, or\nwhatever other website it is I want\n\n546\n00:25:30.730 --> 00:25:34.080\nto go to, those favorites have been\nbrought over and brought into Safari.\n\n547\n00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:39.170\nAnd if I browse into the finder and\ngo into my documents,\n\n548\n00:25:39.170 --> 00:25:42.850\nthere's my form letter, my instructions,\nmy resume, those have been brought over.\n\n549\n00:25:42.850 --> 00:25:44.890\nIf I go into all my files,\n\n550\n00:25:44.890 --> 00:25:48.310\nI'll see there's my smiley face\npicture that we brought over.\n\n551\n00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:49.860\nSo we've got that.\n\n552\n00:25:49.860 --> 00:25:51.230\nIf I go to the enclosing folder on it,\n\n553\n00:25:51.230 --> 00:25:53.710\nyou'll see it's actually\nmoved it into my pictures.\n\n554\n00:25:53.710 --> 00:25:55.540\nIf I had gone up here to like,\n\n555\n00:25:55.540 --> 00:25:59.570\nGo, and, does pictures not\nshow up in Go by default?\n\n556\n00:26:00.750 --> 00:26:01.410\nI guess not.\n\n557\n00:26:01.410 --> 00:26:01.980\nHmph.\n\n558\n00:26:01.980 --> 00:26:04.070\nWell, if I go to my home folder,\nit will show up there.\n\n559\n00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:07.070\nAnd I've got pictures, I can browse into\npictures and there's that smiley face.\n\n560\n00:26:07.070 --> 00:26:10.770\nSo it brought that data over and\nnow I'm ready to go, all right?\n\n561\n00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:16.680\nIt brought the data over, but there is\na little caveat I need to throw in here.\n\n562\n00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:20.240\nThere's things that it doesn't bring over,\nlike applications.\n\n563\n00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:23.340\nSo, for example, if I had a bunch of\nWord documents in my documents folder,\n\n564\n00:26:23.340 --> 00:26:24.770\nit would have brought those over.\n\n565\n00:26:24.770 --> 00:26:27.850\nAnd when I go into documents,\nI'd have all these Word documents.\n\n566\n00:26:27.850 --> 00:26:29.980\nBut I wouldn't have Microsoft Word, and so\n\n567\n00:26:29.980 --> 00:26:31.390\nI wouldn't necessarily\nbe able to open those.\n\n568\n00:26:31.390 --> 00:26:36.360\nNow the preview app in Mac OS,\nit will open a ton of documents.\n\n569\n00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:38.060\nIt will open Word documents.\n\n570\n00:26:38.060 --> 00:26:41.240\nSo you'll be able to read them, but\nyou won't be able to edit them.\n\n571\n00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:42.397\nSo I still need applications.\n\n572\n00:26:42.397 --> 00:26:45.824\nI still need things like Microsoft Word or\nApple's Pages or whatever,\n\n573\n00:26:45.824 --> 00:26:49.381\nif I want to edit those documents, but\nI gotta make sure I get those put in.\n\n574\n00:26:49.381 --> 00:26:50.780\nSo there's a little more work to do.\n\n575\n00:26:50.780 --> 00:26:55.440\nBut as far as my data, the migration\nassistant brings it over, I've got it, and\n\n576\n00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:56.280\nnow I'm in business.\n\n577\n00:26:56.280 --> 00:26:59.490\n>> Yeah, Don, I used to run into that all\nthe time, migrating users over from old to\n\n578\n00:26:59.490 --> 00:27:03.100\nnew computers, maybe even doing\na migration such as this, and they said,\n\n579\n00:27:03.100 --> 00:27:05.660\nwell, I got all my QuickBooks' files,\nbut I can't open it.\n\n580\n00:27:05.660 --> 00:27:06.240\nWhat's going on?\n\n581\n00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:07.580\nI double-click on it, nothing happens.\n\n582\n00:27:07.580 --> 00:27:10.360\nWell, you have to install\nthe QuickBooks application,\n\n583\n00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:11.910\nbecause that is what those files go to.\n\n584\n00:27:11.910 --> 00:27:13.710\nIf you don't have the application,\nit's not gonna work.\n\n585\n00:27:13.710 --> 00:27:16.570\nSame thing here,\nif you've got the files, that's great.\n\n586\n00:27:16.570 --> 00:27:17.150\nThey are there.\n\n587\n00:27:17.150 --> 00:27:19.350\nBut you also need\nthe application to open them.\n\n588\n00:27:19.350 --> 00:27:22.440\nDon, this is actually a really\ncool piece of software.\n\n589\n00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:23.940\nIt looks like Apple did\na great job with it.\n\n590\n00:27:23.940 --> 00:27:25.220\nIt really worked really easily.\n\n591\n00:27:25.220 --> 00:27:29.522\nI gotta admit, the hacker in me [LAUGH]\nsays, man, that'd be a great Trojan.\n\n592\n00:27:29.522 --> 00:27:33.550\n[LAUGH] Cuz this is gonna cipher\nright through their stuff and\n\n593\n00:27:33.550 --> 00:27:34.950\ngive me everything I need.\n\n594\n00:27:34.950 --> 00:27:37.370\nIs there anything else about this\nthough that we need to know for\n\n595\n00:27:37.370 --> 00:27:38.880\nthe exam or for the show?\n\n596\n00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:41.520\n>> As far as the migration assistant\nis concerned, that's about it.\n\n597\n00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:44.770\nI did mention the applications, and don't\nworry, I'm not just gonna fluff over that,\n\n598\n00:27:44.770 --> 00:27:46.670\nwe're gonna have some\nmore episodes coming up.\n\n599\n00:27:46.670 --> 00:27:50.140\nWe're gonna talk about virtualization on a\nMac, and we're gonna talk about Boot Camp,\n\n600\n00:27:50.140 --> 00:27:54.770\nwhere we can actually run Windows from our\nMac, which are great ways to get around\n\n601\n00:27:54.770 --> 00:27:58.060\nmissing applications, or things that we\nhad in Windows that we need on the Mac.\n\n602\n00:27:58.060 --> 00:27:59.310\nSo, for people who say, yeah,\n\n603\n00:27:59.310 --> 00:28:01.770\nI don't want to go to a Mac because\nit doesn't have the software I need,\n\n604\n00:28:01.770 --> 00:28:02.880\nthere's ways we can work around that,\n\n605\n00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:05.120\nand we're gonna get a chance to see\nthose in the upcoming episodes.\n\n606\n00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:07.350\nBut in this one,\nwe focused on the migration assistant.\n\n607\n00:28:07.350 --> 00:28:10.220\nYou may never use it in your entire life,\nbut it is on the exam,\n\n608\n00:28:10.220 --> 00:28:12.440\nso you need to be aware of it,\nhow it works, and what it does.\n\n609\n00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:15.362\n>> Alright, well, Don,\nthank you again for stopping by, and\n\n610\n00:28:15.362 --> 00:28:16.796\nexplaining these concepts,\n\n611\n00:28:16.796 --> 00:28:20.480\nshowing us how to use the little manager\nhere that allows us to migrate over.\n\n612\n00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:22.858\nIt is a very nice little tool,\nI'm gonna look into it a little more.\n\n613\n00:28:22.858 --> 00:28:26.410\n[LAUGH] That being said, we'd like to\nthank you guys for watching today.\n\n614\n00:28:26.410 --> 00:28:28.590\nHopefully you enjoyed it and\nyou learned a little bit.\n\n615\n00:28:28.590 --> 00:28:31.560\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n616\n00:28:31.560 -->

ITPRO.TV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.720\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\n\n4\n00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.720\nin today's episode, we're continuing on\nwith our Mac integration basics series.\n\n5\n00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.500\nJoining us back in the studio today is\nour good friend and mentor Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n6\n00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:27.320\nDon welcome back sir.\n\n7\n00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:28.070\nHow are you doing?\n\n8\n00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:29.590\nI'm doing great Daniel thanks for\nhaving me back.\n\n9\n00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:32.560\nAnd ready to jump back into\nthe world of Mac integration basics.\n\n10\n00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:37.160\nIn this episode, we're going to be taking\na look at time machine inside of Mac OS.\n\n11\n00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.410\nAnd let me tell you this is one of those\nservices that if you're not using it you\n\n12\n00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:41.430\nabsolutely should.\n\n13\n00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.840\nTime machine is really pretty sweet.\n\n14\n00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.800\nAt its heart, it's just a simple way for\nus to back up our data so\n\n15\n00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.900\nwe can quickly restore if we ever\nhave some kind of a failure.\n\n16\n00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:51.765\nDo we get DeLoreans?\n\n17\n00:00:51.765 --> 00:00:52.868\nThat would be sweet.\n\n18\n00:00:52.868 --> 00:00:56.546\nThat would be awesome.\n[LAUGH] So, with Time Machine,\n\n19\n00:00:56.546 --> 00:01:00.550\nlet's think of this as a story,\nlet's go back in time.\n\n20\n00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:02.790\nI know I had this happen to me\nonce where I was in college,\n\n21\n00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:06.260\nand I was using my computer and\nit started acting a little funny and\n\n22\n00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.820\nI rebooted it and\nthen it wouldn't boot up.\n\n23\n00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.020\nAnd then I found out\nthe hard drive had failed.\n\n24\n00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:13.190\nRight, hard drives fail.\n\n25\n00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:14.530\nThey don't last forever.\n\n26\n00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.050\nUsually you're lucky if you can get three\nyears out of the darn things if they're\n\n27\n00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:20.660\nSSD if they're spinning usually\nyou know you don't get forever.\n\n28\n00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:21.800\nEventually they fail.\n\n29\n00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.348\nAnd when they do fail what\nhappens to your data?\n\n30\n00:01:24.348 --> 00:01:29.200\nWell, maybe,\nmaybe you can recover data off of it.\n\n31\n00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.210\nBut most of the time you\njust lose your information.\n\n32\n00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.120\nAnd if you don't have a backup,\nthat's a real bad place to be.\n\n33\n00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.550\nNow, thanks to cloud technologies and\na lot of the services we have these days,\n\n34\n00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:39.640\nlike if you're using your iCloud storage,\n\n35\n00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.000\nthen maybe all your data is backed up\nalready and you don't worry about it.\n\n36\n00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.280\nRight, there's plenty of\nalternatives to Time Machine.\n\n37\n00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.990\nThere's things like Dropbox and iCloud and\nOneDrive I don't like to talk about\n\n38\n00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.850\nthat one, and some of the others out there\nthat can back your data up to the cloud.\n\n39\n00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:54.510\nThose are great, but\nif you don't have those.\n\n40\n00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:56.030\nIf you don't have a good\nbackup solution and\n\n41\n00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.350\nyour hard drive fails\nyou're going to lose data.\n\n42\n00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.750\nAnd you know it's not even necessarily\njust about a hard drive failing.\n\n43\n00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.610\nMaybe it's just I do something\naccidental like I delete a file.\n\n44\n00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:06.510\nI deleted a file a week ago and\n\n45\n00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:10.670\nthen I realized today shoot I\nreally need that file, it's gone.\n\n46\n00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:12.440\nWell, if I deleted it, where does it go?\n\n47\n00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.810\nIt goes into the trash, right?\n\n48\n00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.900\nSo I can always get it out of the trash,\nif it's still there,\n\n49\n00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:22.150\nif I haven't emptied the trash on my Mac,\nor if I've deleted it and\n\n50\n00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.180\nit's gone from the trash,\nthen I'm out of luck, right?\n\n51\n00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.380\nOr what if I overwrite a file?\n\n52\n00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.650\nIf I open up a word document, and\nI deleted a paragraph out, and\n\n53\n00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.370\nI save the document, right?\n\n54\n00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.060\nWell I over-wrote the existing file,\nso it's not in the trash.\n\n55\n00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.930\nIt's just gone.\n\n56\n00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.610\nI've lost that paragraph forever, and\nif I want it back, well tough luck.\n\n57\n00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.370\nSo my hard drive didn't fail but\nI lost data.\n\n58\n00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:44.490\nThat's happens.\n\n59\n00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:46.430\nTime Machine protects us from both.\n\n60\n00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.530\nWhen you lose a hard drive,\nwhen you have hard drive failure, or\n\n61\n00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.160\nwhen you just lose data,\nit'll help you recover both.\n\n62\n00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.020\nAnd so it's a great idea to have it set up\nand running and backing up your system.\n\n63\n00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:56.860\nSo in this show I'm gonna\nwalk you through that.\n\n64\n00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:01.180\nBut different ways that we can use\nTime Machine and make it work for us.\n\n65\n00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.930\nI use it all the time.\n\n66\n00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.740\nIt's saved my bacon a few times so\nit's definitely something you want to use.\n\n67\n00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:08.700\nAll right, well let's just start\nwith basic Time Machine 101, right.\n\n68\n00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.100\nSo I wanna get Time Machine\nenabled on my Mac.\n\n69\n00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:12.140\nWell I'm not running it.\n\n70\n00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.340\nSo I've got this Mac here, and actually\nI had this one set up as a server,\n\n71\n00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.250\nwhich just means it's Mac OS\nwith the server app installed.\n\n72\n00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.280\nYou definitely want to back up a server,\nbut I probably want to\n\n73\n00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.160\nback up work stations too so\nyou configure this on work stations.\n\n74\n00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.470\nI run it on my own laptop,\nrunning it right now.\n\n75\n00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:32.290\nThe only you really need is some\nkind of external storage, right?\n\n76\n00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.240\nYou don't want to back up to your own\nhard drive, you always want to back up to\n\n77\n00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:38.290\nan external device because your\ninternal hard drive could die.\n\n78\n00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.410\nSo if I'm backing up my data to the\ninternal hard drive, what good is that?\n\n79\n00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:43.220\nIt's no good.\nIt's not going to help you.\n\n80\n00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:44.520\nSo we need an external device.\n\n81\n00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.930\nAnd so you'll see I've got two\nhard drives in this server.\n\n82\n00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.550\nI've got my Macintosh HD, and\nthen I've added a second storage drive.\n\n83\n00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:54.380\nNow, if you have a Mac Pro or\neven one of the older Mac Minis,\n\n84\n00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:56.320\nyou can fit two hard drives inside of it.\n\n85\n00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.170\nSo it doesn't have to be\nan external hard drive,\n\n86\n00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:59.909\nit could be a second drive inside of it.\n\n87\n00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:06.080\nBut if you have a MacBook Pro or a newer\nMac mini they don't have any space.\n\n88\n00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.970\nOr even an iMac.\n\n89\n00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:08.710\nThere's no space to add\na second hard drive.\n\n90\n00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:10.660\nIt's going to have to be\nan external device, and\n\n91\n00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:12.830\nthat's kind of what I'm\nusing here on my laptop.\n\n92\n00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:14.410\nSo, here I've got this second drive.\n\n93\n00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:18.610\nIt's a 500 gig drive and\nit's just sitting there doing nothing.\n\n94\n00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:20.650\nWell, any time you add\nexternal storage and\n\n95\n00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:24.800\nyou format it, your Mac is gonna try and\nturn on Time Machine for you.\n\n96\n00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.690\nSo, for example, if I go into Disk Utility\nand I choose that storage drive and\n\n97\n00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:31.340\nI'm going to erase it, right.\n\n98\n00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:32.560\nAnd I'm just gonna call it Time Machine.\n\n99\n00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:33.380\nNow, the name doesn't matter.\n\n100\n00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:34.410\nI can call it whatever I want.\n\n101\n00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:35.990\nI can call it Bob.\n\n102\n00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:37.580\nIt doesn't matter about the name.\n\n103\n00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:41.470\nWhenever you format a disk,\nif you're not already using Time Machine,\n\n104\n00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:43.310\nthe system is gonna ask\nyou if you wanna use it.\n\n105\n00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:45.190\nSee here.\nI just got my pop up, right.\n\n106\n00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:48.630\nAnd it's saying, hey I just\nnoticed you added another drive,\n\n107\n00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:50.870\nwould you like to use\nit with Time Machine?\n\n108\n00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:54.510\nAnd if you do, you just hit Use\nas backup disk, and you're done.\n\n109\n00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:57.880\nEasiest thing in the planet,\nyou're now backed up, all right?\n\n110\n00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.235\nOr you can say, don't use or\nor decide later.\n\n111\n00:05:00.235 --> 00:05:02.245\nI don't know,\nmaybe I'll make up my mind later.\n\n112\n00:05:02.245 --> 00:05:03.725\nI'm gonna say don't use for\n\n113\n00:05:03.725 --> 00:05:06.685\nright now, because this use as\nbackup disk button is too easy.\n\n114\n00:05:06.685 --> 00:05:08.235\nYou just push it and\neverything's done, and\n\n115\n00:05:08.235 --> 00:05:09.360\nI wanna make it look like this is hard.\n\n116\n00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.715\n[LAUGHS] So I'm gonna choose don't use.\n\n117\n00:05:11.715 --> 00:05:13.285\nIt's not that I want to make it hard,\n\n118\n00:05:13.285 --> 00:05:15.245\nit's that I want to show you\nguys each of the steps involved.\n\n119\n00:05:15.245 --> 00:05:16.975\nSo I'm gonna say don't use.\n\n120\n00:05:16.975 --> 00:05:17.810\nAll right.\n\n121\n00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:20.070\nNow I've got this extra\ndrive sitting here.\n\n122\n00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:21.940\nBut it's not a Time Machine disk yet.\n\n123\n00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:23.200\nNow how do I know that?\n\n124\n00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:24.130\nCuz of the icon.\n\n125\n00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:25.890\nThe icons just a regular hard drive icon.\n\n126\n00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:29.910\nWhen its set up for Time Machine it'll\nactually change into a blue disk with\n\n127\n00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:34.580\na little time machine logo on it so it's\nnot being used for Time Machine right now.\n\n128\n00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:35.340\nThat's my first hint.\n\n129\n00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:37.280\nMy second hint is that the drive is empty.\n\n130\n00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:39.860\nSo if it is a Time Machine disk,\nI'm not doing a very good job.\n\n131\n00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:42.550\nSo it's not set up for it yet.\n\n132\n00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:46.130\nSo what I'm going to do now is I'm\ngoing to fire up my spotlight and\n\n133\n00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:48.300\nI'm going to run Time Machine.\n\n134\n00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:50.620\nIt's in your applications folder,\nunder utilities.\n\n135\n00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:53.790\nI'm going to fire it up, and\nthe first thing its gonna do is say, hey\n\n136\n00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:57.650\nyou haven't selected a location for time\nmachine backups, we need to set it up now.\n\n137\n00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:59.560\nSo I'm gonna choose to\nset up Time Machine.\n\n138\n00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:02.360\nAll right now when we go to set it up,\n\n139\n00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:05.150\nwe're gonna have to pick the hard\ndrive that we want to back up to.\n\n140\n00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:07.880\nSo I've got select a back\nup disk right here and\n\n141\n00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:12.910\nI'm gonna choose that back up and\nI'll pick Time Machine, okay?\n\n142\n00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:14.730\nNow notice this second little note here,\n\n143\n00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:18.810\nI'm gonna talk about this later in\nthe show, Other AirPort Time Capsule.\n\n144\n00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:22.680\nNormally we're backing up to an external\ndrive attached to our system, but\n\n145\n00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:25.000\nwhat if I have four or five Macs?\n\n146\n00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.900\nI can buy the Time Capsule from Apple,\nwhich is a wireless access point you can\n\n147\n00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:33.580\nplug into your network, that has either\none or two terabytes of storage in it.\n\n148\n00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:35.450\nAnd you can back up over the network.\n\n149\n00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:38.570\nI'll show you how to do that even without\na Time Capsule, later in the show.\n\n150\n00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:44.840\nNow, when I pick this drive, the default\nis that it's gonna back up my data and\n\n151\n00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:46.760\nput it on this drive.\n\n152\n00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:49.020\nAnd if I, let me just cancel, if you look,\n\n153\n00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:50.330\nhere's where it tells you\nwhat you're going to do.\n\n154\n00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:53.820\nIt's going to do hourly back ups for\nthe past 24 hours.\n\n155\n00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:56.040\nWhen I turn this on,\nit's gonna do one big backup.\n\n156\n00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:58.030\nIt's gonna backup my whole system.\n\n157\n00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:02.650\nAnd then every hour it's\ngonna take a backup.\n\n158\n00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:06.440\nNow the backup it does every\nhour is not a full backup.\n\n159\n00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:10.680\nSo if I have 20 terabytes of data, it's\nnot gonna back up 20 terabytes of data.\n\n160\n00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:12.230\nIt will the first time.\n\n161\n00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:15.950\nBut every hour after that,\nit's only backing up what changes.\n\n162\n00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:19.180\nSo just the stuff that I modify,\nso the backups become very small.\n\n163\n00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:22.170\nThey happen very quickly, and\nit does it every hour, and\n\n164\n00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:24.410\nit's gonna save those for 24 hours.\n\n165\n00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:29.230\nAfter 24 hours, it's gonna roll\nthose down into one backup.\n\n166\n00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:33.560\nSo it's saving a backup every single\nday for the past month, so for\n\n167\n00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:35.120\nthe last 31 days.\n\n168\n00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:37.940\nAnd then after 31 days,\n\n169\n00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:43.380\nit saves one backup a week for\nas many weeks as it has room to store.\n\n170\n00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:45.030\nEventually your hard\ndrive runs out of space.\n\n171\n00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:48.887\nIt can't store any more backups, so it\ndeletes the old backups to make room for\n\n172\n00:07:48.887 --> 00:07:49.422\nnew ones.\n\n173\n00:07:49.422 --> 00:07:53.173\nThe cool part about this is I can restore\nback to various points in time, so\n\n174\n00:07:53.173 --> 00:07:56.211\nif I'm like man,\nI deleted that file at 3 PM today.\n\n175\n00:07:56.211 --> 00:08:00.747\nWell, it's 4 PM right now, so\na Time Machine backup ran.\n\n176\n00:08:00.747 --> 00:08:02.144\nLet me just go back to 2 PM.\n\n177\n00:08:02.144 --> 00:08:05.190\nAnd I can get the document\nas it was at 2 PM.\n\n178\n00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:08.490\nOr if I deleted it a week ago I\ncan go back a week and get to it.\n\n179\n00:08:08.490 --> 00:08:11.560\nAnd I can go back as far as I can as\nlong as I have disk space for it.\n\n180\n00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:13.030\nSo that's what it's going to do.\n\n181\n00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:17.070\nSo when I select that backup disk and\nI pick that time machine disk that I made,\n\n182\n00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:20.600\nit's going to start that\nfirst initial backup.\n\n183\n00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:23.210\nIt's going to backup my whole drive.\n\n184\n00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:24.840\nNow before I do that,\n\n185\n00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:27.870\nthere's a neat little option right\nhere to encrypt the backups.\n\n186\n00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:33.110\nIf you're using an internal drive,\nthis may or may not be necessary for you.\n\n187\n00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:36.270\nBut if you're using an external drive,\nthis is really important,\n\n188\n00:08:36.270 --> 00:08:40.740\nbecause what if you lose your external\ndrive and somebody gets a hold of it?\n\n189\n00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:42.910\nAll of your data is on that drive and\n\n190\n00:08:42.910 --> 00:08:46.980\nthey can hook it up to whatever Mac they\nwanted and restore it and now they've got\n\n191\n00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:51.480\nan exact copy of your computer with\nall your data, that's not good, right?\n\n192\n00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:55.510\nEven if it's an internal drive somebody\ncould still steal your physical computer.\n\n193\n00:08:55.510 --> 00:08:59.030\nSo if you're using file vault on your main\ndrive you might as well use encryption on\n\n194\n00:08:59.030 --> 00:09:00.840\nyour time machine also to encrypt it.\n\n195\n00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:02.900\nBut on a external drive\nit is really important.\n\n196\n00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:05.460\nSo I've got this external drive\nhooked up to my laptop and\n\n197\n00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:09.360\nI've got a big sticker on the front\nof it and it says Don's Backup.\n\n198\n00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:11.370\nAnd it's, Daniel you can vouch for me.\n\n199\n00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:13.410\nIt says D Pozent backup.\n\n200\n00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:15.060\nD Pozent backup I lied.\n\n201\n00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:17.890\nSo I've got a big sticker right on there.\n\n202\n00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:20.980\nAnybody could walk into this studio and\nsay ooh, that's Don's backup,\n\n203\n00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:22.890\nthat's gotta sticker on it,\nit must be accurate.\n\n204\n00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:25.850\nWe certainly wouldn't label\nsomething wrong around here.\n\n205\n00:09:25.850 --> 00:09:28.910\nSo they could take it, run home and\nnow they've got all my data.\n\n206\n00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:30.600\nSo I need to encrypt that.\n\n207\n00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:32.070\nWe've got that option and\nwe can turn it off.\n\n208\n00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:35.140\nI'm going to leave it off here in\nthe show, only because we've only got a 30\n\n209\n00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:37.340\nminute show and\nI don't want to take too long with this.\n\n210\n00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:39.990\nBut in real life land,\nI always turn that on.\n\n211\n00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:41.520\nAlways, always, always.\n\n212\n00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:44.360\nAnd it will generate a recovery\nkey that you will need to save.\n\n213\n00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:48.080\nBecause if you lose that recovery key, you\nwon't be able to open up that backup and\n\n214\n00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:49.250\nthen it's like you don't have a backup.\n\n215\n00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:50.230\nSo that would be bad.\n\n216\n00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:52.110\nBut I will leave that off for now.\n\n217\n00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:53.460\nAll right,\nI'm gonna choose to use that disk.\n\n218\n00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:55.670\nAnd as soon as I do that,\n\n219\n00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:59.420\nnow it's showing that I've got\n536 GB available on this disk.\n\n220\n00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:00.600\nThe oldest backup is none.\n\n221\n00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:01.640\nThe latest backup is none.\n\n222\n00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:03.900\nAnd it's gonna do a backup in two minutes.\n\n223\n00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:06.000\nIt just waits two minutes\nbefore it kicks in.\n\n224\n00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.560\nAnd so after two minutes,\nit's gonna start running that backup.\n\n225\n00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:12.270\nAnd the first full backup may take awhile.\n\n226\n00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:13.726\nIt's got a lot of data to back up.\n\n227\n00:10:13.726 --> 00:10:19.038\nBut once it's done, it's then gonna run\na backup once an hour for 24 hours.\n\n228\n00:10:19.038 --> 00:10:22.188\nReally, for now on it's gonna\nrun one backup every hour and\n\n229\n00:10:22.188 --> 00:10:25.657\nthen it just deletes the old backups\nto make room for the new ones.\n\n230\n00:10:25.657 --> 00:10:29.083\nNow that first backup can take a little\nwhile and I'm kind of impatient so\n\n231\n00:10:29.083 --> 00:10:30.891\nI want to show you guys this in action.\n\n232\n00:10:30.891 --> 00:10:33.160\nAnd we'll just look on my\nlaptop here in a moment.\n\n233\n00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:36.360\nThere's one more thing I want to\npoint out right here in this screen.\n\n234\n00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:40.070\nThere's a little button right here that\nsays show time machine in menu bar.\n\n235\n00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:42.190\nThat's a really useful thing.\n\n236\n00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:44.150\nI like to have that turned on.\n\n237\n00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:47.810\nAnd the reason is, it's really\neasy to forget about time machine.\n\n238\n00:10:47.810 --> 00:10:48.810\nIt runs in the background.\n\n239\n00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:49.550\nWe never see it.\n\n240\n00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:52.200\nYou kind of lose sight of\nthe fact that it's running.\n\n241\n00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:55.210\nI like to have some way to verify that and\nknow my backups are running.\n\n242\n00:10:55.210 --> 00:10:58.750\nIf you show it in the menu\nbar what it does is it adds\n\n243\n00:10:59.790 --> 00:11:01.580\nthis little icon right here.\n\n244\n00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:05.025\nAnd at any time you can go and click\non it, and you can see what it's doing.\n\n245\n00:11:05.025 --> 00:11:08.992\nMine says preparing the backup, and it'll\nlet me know if I've started a backup or\n\n246\n00:11:08.992 --> 00:11:09.868\nif I'm running.\n\n247\n00:11:09.868 --> 00:11:13.120\nThere it is, actually backing up\nhow much data I've got to back up.\n\n248\n00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:14.190\nAnd so I can see that.\n\n249\n00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:18.680\nJust a quick way to visually tell\nthe time machine is doing its job, right.\n\n250\n00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:21.070\nSo I like to turn that option on,\ndefinitely a good one to have.\n\n251\n00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:24.895\nNow that one's starting to run a back up,\nand\n\n252\n00:11:24.895 --> 00:11:28.752\nthis drive is now officially going\nto become a time machine back up.\n\n253\n00:11:28.752 --> 00:11:31.980\nIt isn't showing it now because\nApple does not refresh the desktop.\n\n254\n00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:35.210\nBut the next time that I\nreboot the icon will change,\n\n255\n00:11:35.210 --> 00:11:38.280\nand it'll be a blue icon with\na little time machine logo on it and\n\n256\n00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:43.090\nif I browse into it there's\na folder called backups.backupdb.\n\n257\n00:11:43.090 --> 00:11:47.670\nIt's a backup database for my laptop and\nit's backing up that information.\n\n258\n00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:50.170\nSo that's how you can spot\na time machine backup real easy.\n\n259\n00:11:50.170 --> 00:11:53.200\nYou know Don it seems like Apples really\ngone out of their way to make something\n\n260\n00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:56.400\nthat a lot of people find to\nbe a little overwhelming.\n\n261\n00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:57.980\nMaybe a bit scary right?\n\n262\n00:11:57.980 --> 00:12:00.520\nYeah I know I'm supposed\nto be taking backups,\n\n263\n00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:04.635\nbut that sounds like what tech guys do,\nand I'm not really tech savvy.\n\n264\n00:12:04.635 --> 00:12:07.820\nBut really you could've used\nthe one button option and\n\n265\n00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:09.450\nturned this on completely.\n\n266\n00:12:09.450 --> 00:12:12.940\nAnd even the other option, the other way\nthat you've shown us how to get to it,\n\n267\n00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:14.440\nreally wasn't that difficult.\n\n268\n00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:18.430\nIt's really helping us do one of\nthe best best practices we can do.\n\n269\n00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:21.550\nBecause like you said,\nhard drives are gonna die.\n\n270\n00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:22.380\nYou're gonna lose data.\n\n271\n00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:25.000\nIf you don't have it backed up,\nthat stuff's gonna be gone.\n\n272\n00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:25.890\nYeah, absolutely.\n\n273\n00:12:25.890 --> 00:12:27.670\nSo let's take a look at my laptop,\n\n274\n00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:29.890\nwhere we'll get a chance to see\nit kind of real and in action.\n\n275\n00:12:29.890 --> 00:12:31.100\nThis is just a lab machine here.\n\n276\n00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:32.110\nIt's not very exciting.\n\n277\n00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:34.740\nBut I'll show you my honest to\ngoodness real laptop, right?\n\n278\n00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:36.690\nSo here's the laptop that I use.\n\n279\n00:12:36.690 --> 00:12:40.980\nAnd you can see I've got my Macintosh HD,\nand there's my external time machine disk.\n\n280\n00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:42.890\nYou see how it's blue and\nit's got the little arrow?\n\n281\n00:12:42.890 --> 00:12:45.580\nI use slightly fancier icons so\nit's a little bit different.\n\n282\n00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:49.010\nBut that's basically what it looks like so\nthat I know that's my time machine disk.\n\n283\n00:12:49.010 --> 00:12:52.820\nAnd if I open that up, I can see\nthat it's got that Backups.backupdb.\n\n284\n00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:54.770\nThat's the backup for my laptop.\n\n285\n00:12:54.770 --> 00:12:57.930\nNow my laptop has a 500 gig disk.\n\n286\n00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:01.070\nThe external drive is 1 terabyte.\n\n287\n00:13:01.070 --> 00:13:03.650\nSo it's bigger than my disk and\nthe reason I do that is\n\n288\n00:13:03.650 --> 00:13:06.990\nbecause I want to be able to store\nbackups as far back as possible.\n\n289\n00:13:06.990 --> 00:13:09.893\nNow I actually don't go very far back\nbecause every time on the show I need\n\n290\n00:13:09.893 --> 00:13:13.040\na removable disk I end up formatting this\nand using it so I don't go back that far.\n\n291\n00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:17.630\nBut if I take a look at that disk.\n\n292\n00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:20.270\nLet me just pull up it's info here and\nsee what I'm using.\n\n293\n00:13:20.270 --> 00:13:24.810\nSo it's 1 terabyte and I've only got\n374 gigs available on it right now.\n\n294\n00:13:24.810 --> 00:13:27.080\nSo I'm using 625 gigs.\n\n295\n00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:29.700\nI'm using more space than\nmy internal hard drive is.\n\n296\n00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:33.580\nAnd that's because it's got everything\nthat's changed over time and\n\n297\n00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:36.580\nthat adds up to more than what my disk is,\nall right.\n\n298\n00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:41.680\nNow, you can see my time machine\nicon up on the menu bar up here.\n\n299\n00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:45.670\nAnd if I click on that,\nI'm actually running a back up right now.\n\n300\n00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:47.090\nI didn't start that, it's doing it.\n\n301\n00:13:47.090 --> 00:13:51.060\nAnd it's backing up 115 gigs of data?\n\n302\n00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:52.730\nI set it to only back\nup things that change.\n\n303\n00:13:52.730 --> 00:13:54.600\nWhat did I do that's that big?\n\n304\n00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:56.820\nWell, I use a lot of virtual\nmachines on the show and\n\n305\n00:13:56.820 --> 00:13:58.890\nthose virtual machines grow pretty fast.\n\n306\n00:13:58.890 --> 00:14:01.550\nAnd so that's why I've got 115\ngigs of changes in the last\n\n307\n00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:03.580\nhour as my virtual machine's changing.\n\n308\n00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:05.070\nSo that can be a bit of a problem.\n\n309\n00:14:05.070 --> 00:14:08.750\nI'm gonna hit Skip This Backup and\nstop it just don't have to wait on that.\n\n310\n00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:12.880\nAnd now it's telling me my latest back\nup was yesterday at 7:47 AM, all right.\n\n311\n00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:17.600\nYesterday I took this laptop out\nof my docking station, and so\n\n312\n00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:20.550\nit wasn't able to see the time\nmachine disk anymore.\n\n313\n00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:23.100\nAnd then I left it out of\nthe dock last night, and\n\n314\n00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:25.540\nit wasn't until right before this\nshow that I plugged it back in.\n\n315\n00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:27.006\nThat's why I was running that backup.\n\n316\n00:14:27.006 --> 00:14:30.310\nSo I haven't backed up since yesterday,\nbut I can quickly and\n\n317\n00:14:30.310 --> 00:14:31.940\neasily see that from the menu bar.\n\n318\n00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:35.868\nI can say I need to do a back up,\nlet me go hook up that drive and see it.\n\n319\n00:14:35.868 --> 00:14:40.122\nThat is really a great point to be honest\nwith you, because maybe that will give\n\n320\n00:14:40.122 --> 00:14:43.988\nyou a kind of question that says,\nhey you're running a time machine and\n\n321\n00:14:43.988 --> 00:14:46.969\nthe user has went home,\nthey shut their machine down.\n\n322\n00:14:46.969 --> 00:14:49.690\nAnd you don't see that it\ndid the hourly backup.\n\n323\n00:14:49.690 --> 00:14:50.220\nWhy not?\nWell,\n\n324\n00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:53.060\nthe machine wasn't connected,\ntherefore it could not do the backup.\n\n325\n00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:55.790\nIt's one of those things that they try to\nget you on, cuz it can be a little tricky.\n\n326\n00:14:55.790 --> 00:14:58.370\nCuz you're thinking, yeah,\nit's supposed to be hourly, and\n\n327\n00:14:58.370 --> 00:14:59.480\nit didn't do that hourly.\n\n328\n00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:00.150\nWhy is that?\n\n329\n00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:02.790\nAnd that's the kind of questions\nthey could throw at you.\n\n330\n00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:04.700\nBuilding on that, Daniel, and\nI'm glad you mentioned it,\n\n331\n00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:05.960\ncuz I completely forgot about this.\n\n332\n00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:09.130\nThere is a neat little feature\nin El Capitan called Power Nap.\n\n333\n00:15:09.130 --> 00:15:11.450\nAnd Power Nap was actually\nintroduced back in Yosemite.\n\n334\n00:15:11.450 --> 00:15:15.810\nBut if I go into my system preferences and\nI go into my energy saver.\n\n335\n00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:19.870\nIn the energy saver you've\ngot several options and\n\n336\n00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:21.700\none of them is to enable Power Nap.\n\n337\n00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:22.790\nAnd if you look at it,\n\n338\n00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:27.700\nit says, while sleeping your Mac\ncan back up using Time Machine and\n\n339\n00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:30.512\nperiodically check for new email,\ncalendar, and other iCloud updates.\n\n340\n00:15:30.512 --> 00:15:32.810\nAll right, if this is turned off and\n\n341\n00:15:32.810 --> 00:15:36.060\nyour Mac goes to sleep it's\nnot going to run backups.\n\n342\n00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:40.090\nBut if your Mac goes to sleep,\nonce an hour it will wake up,\n\n343\n00:15:40.090 --> 00:15:43.510\nrun a time machine backup, and\nthen go back to sleep again, right?\n\n344\n00:15:43.510 --> 00:15:45.420\nAnd then that way you're\ngetting backups even when\n\n345\n00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:46.780\nthe machine is in a power saving mode.\n\n346\n00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:49.186\nIt's called Power Nap and\nyou need to have that turned on.\n\n347\n00:15:49.186 --> 00:15:52.232\nI can't remember if that's\nturned on by default or not but\n\n348\n00:15:52.232 --> 00:15:56.353\nI've got it turned on on mine because my\nlaptop tends to go to sleep quite a bit.\n\n349\n00:15:56.353 --> 00:15:59.914\nSo that's a little option you can\nturn on that's kind of important.\n\n350\n00:15:59.914 --> 00:16:03.979\nNow I've been running backups on my\nmachine and they go back a certain ways,\n\n351\n00:16:03.979 --> 00:16:06.350\nright, cuz I got a ton of data.\n\n352\n00:16:06.350 --> 00:16:07.540\nHow do we get at that?\n\n353\n00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:11.100\nSo, maybe I've lost some data.\n\n354\n00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:12.110\nI need to restore.\n\n355\n00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:14.630\nI need to get this file back\nthat I deleted by accident.\n\n356\n00:16:14.630 --> 00:16:16.830\nLet's just take the show notes for\nthis episode.\n\n357\n00:16:16.830 --> 00:16:19.900\nSo, for the Mac integration basics show,\n\n358\n00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:24.060\nI've got show notes that I've made and\nmaybe I accidentally deleted a note.\n\n359\n00:16:24.060 --> 00:16:26.720\nOr I modified a file and changed it.\n\n360\n00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:28.700\nAnd I want it to go back to the old way.\n\n361\n00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:31.150\nWell, I can go back in time and\n\n362\n00:16:31.150 --> 00:16:33.700\nsee what the drive look liked\nbefore I made the mess up.\n\n363\n00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:35.980\nThe easiest way to do that is brow,\n\n364\n00:16:35.980 --> 00:16:39.220\nnot browse there, browse to wherever\nthe files are you're looking for.\n\n365\n00:16:39.220 --> 00:16:43.350\nSo I can browse under my show\nnotes in Mac integration basics.\n\n366\n00:16:43.350 --> 00:16:44.770\nHere we go.\n\n367\n00:16:44.770 --> 00:16:48.460\nAnd here I've got my show notes folder,\nand I can see all my latest and\n\n368\n00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:49.430\ngreatest stuff.\n\n369\n00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:52.410\nMany of these files were\nmodified just yesterday, so\n\n370\n00:16:52.410 --> 00:16:55.420\nI can see a few of those files\nthat were modified that way.\n\n371\n00:16:55.420 --> 00:16:58.480\nBut if I want to see some\nkind of previous version.\n\n372\n00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:00.940\nSo if I take a look at this file.\n\n373\n00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:01.640\nSo here it is.\n\n374\n00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:05.842\nAnd you can see I've got various notes and\njunk here on the instant messaging.\n\n375\n00:17:05.842 --> 00:17:10.960\nSo it's not terribly exciting and\nif I go back here to the file.\n\n376\n00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:13.860\nI can hit that time machine icon up top.\n\n377\n00:17:13.860 --> 00:17:16.370\nAnd I can enter time machine.\n\n378\n00:17:16.370 --> 00:17:18.740\nI want to enter the time machine.\n\n379\n00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:22.030\nAnd when I do that,\nsee how the folder appears.\n\n380\n00:17:22.030 --> 00:17:24.280\nIt looks like some kind of recursion.\n\n381\n00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:26.820\nWell, on the right side\nI've got a timeline, and\n\n382\n00:17:26.820 --> 00:17:28.440\nmy heads going to cover some of this up.\n\n383\n00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:30.330\nMaybe we can get my head out of the way.\n\n384\n00:17:30.330 --> 00:17:32.080\nGet my head out of the clouds.\n\n385\n00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:34.880\nAnd you can see as I\nfloat my mouse over it,\n\n386\n00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:38.180\nthat different things are appearing\nover here at the side.\n\n387\n00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:41.190\nAnd what those things are are dates and\ntimes.\n\n388\n00:17:41.190 --> 00:17:42.295\nHere's now.\n\n389\n00:17:42.295 --> 00:17:44.338\nWhat I'm looking at,\nhow does it look right now.\n\n390\n00:17:44.338 --> 00:17:47.729\nBut I can go back,\nto yesterday at 7:47 AM.\n\n391\n00:17:47.729 --> 00:17:50.097\nThat's the last time\nmachine backup that I had.\n\n392\n00:17:50.097 --> 00:17:55.415\nOr, 6:45, 5:44, 4:43, see how these\nare all one hour apart, right.\n\n393\n00:17:55.415 --> 00:17:57.285\nThese are the backups its done.\n\n394\n00:17:57.285 --> 00:18:01.095\nOne every hour, as I go back.\n\n395\n00:18:01.095 --> 00:18:06.260\nAnd then, after I get past 24 hours,\nit is going to switch to one a day.\n\n396\n00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:12.250\nSo here we got March 15th and\nthan we got Monday, Saturday,\n\n397\n00:18:12.250 --> 00:18:17.940\nMarch 11th, Thursday, Wednesday,\nTuesday, Monday, it's one a day.\n\n398\n00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:23.320\nIt is going to be one a day for\nthe last month, and then as I keep going,\n\n399\n00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:28.740\none a day for the last month and\nthen we start getting past February and\n\n400\n00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:30.710\nshoot, I must have formatted\nsomewhere around there.\n\n401\n00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:33.410\nSo I must have formatted the drive\nsomewhere back in February.\n\n402\n00:18:33.410 --> 00:18:37.340\nBut then it'll start\ngoing to one a week for\n\n403\n00:18:37.340 --> 00:18:39.140\nas long as we've got storage on the drive.\n\n404\n00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:40.680\nLike I said,\nI format this one periodically.\n\n405\n00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:42.760\nSo I apparently did back in February.\n\n406\n00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:48.610\nBut I can see that folder way back, and\nso if I deleted a file a few days ago,\n\n407\n00:18:48.610 --> 00:18:54.200\nso maybe I'll go back to,\nlet's go back to Monday.\n\n408\n00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:56.740\nSo I'll jump back to Monday and\nwhen I click on that\n\n409\n00:18:56.740 --> 00:19:00.960\nsee how it's rolling that folder back and\nnow I can see how it looked back then.\n\n410\n00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:02.640\nAnd here that's instant messaging file.\n\n411\n00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:07.800\nAnd if I choose that instant\nmessaging file, I can hit restore and\n\n412\n00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:11.250\nit will overwrite the new version\nof it with the old version.\n\n413\n00:19:11.250 --> 00:19:13.630\nSo it'll put me back to\nthe way that I had it.\n\n414\n00:19:13.630 --> 00:19:15.550\nBut I don't have to overwrite.\n\n415\n00:19:15.550 --> 00:19:17.890\nMaybe I just want to open it up and\ncopy something out of it.\n\n416\n00:19:17.890 --> 00:19:22.300\nSo I can just double click on it and\nit's gonna open up and\n\n417\n00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:26.930\nshow me a little bit about that data, and\nthen I've got the share button right here.\n\n418\n00:19:26.930 --> 00:19:30.780\nAnd if I click on that,\nwe can send it to another application.\n\n419\n00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:34.660\nSo I can open it and do stuff that way.\n\n420\n00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:36.000\nYou do have a few different choices.\n\n421\n00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.700\nI can also right click on it.\n\n422\n00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:40.950\nThere we go.\n\n423\n00:19:40.950 --> 00:19:46.290\nAnd you'll see restore, delete all back\nup, delete back up or just open it, right?\n\n424\n00:19:46.290 --> 00:19:49.340\nAnd we can open that up and well, it's\ngonna take me right back to the same one,\n\n425\n00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:52.060\nyou know cuz it's a mark down file and\n\n426\n00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:53.860\nTextEdit doesn't have a preview for\nthat one.\n\n427\n00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:55.998\nSo, I should have picked\nlike a non-marked down file.\n\n428\n00:19:55.998 --> 00:19:57.426\nI got like a PDF here.\n\n429\n00:19:57.426 --> 00:19:58.770\nI guess we could do that one.\n\n430\n00:19:58.770 --> 00:20:00.340\nAnd so when I open that, there we go.\n\n431\n00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:03.770\nInstead of getting that little mark\ndown note, I get the actual PDF.\n\n432\n00:20:03.770 --> 00:20:08.450\nAnd so I can see that document\nas it was before I overwrite\n\n433\n00:20:08.450 --> 00:20:10.580\nthe document that I've\ngot on my system now.\n\n434\n00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:12.580\nSo we get a little bit\nof flexibility there.\n\n435\n00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:16.790\nAnd the important part is that I\ncan just keep going back in time\n\n436\n00:20:16.790 --> 00:20:18.070\nto find the oldest version.\n\n437\n00:20:18.070 --> 00:20:21.030\nNow, some of these files I might\nnot have an older version of.\n\n438\n00:20:21.030 --> 00:20:25.070\nIf I go back too far this folder\nmight not have existed, and\n\n439\n00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:28.050\nin fact we just started planning\nthis show a few weeks ago so\n\n440\n00:20:28.050 --> 00:20:31.540\nI can't go that far back on it\nversus some of my other folders.\n\n441\n00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:34.470\nLike if I go to my\nvirtual machines folder,\n\n442\n00:20:34.470 --> 00:20:36.890\nthat thing, let's just browse into that.\n\n443\n00:20:36.890 --> 00:20:38.720\nHere we go.\nHere's my virtual machines folder and so\n\n444\n00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:41.820\nyou can see where I've got some of the\nvirtual machines I'm using in this show.\n\n445\n00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:44.760\nWell, that's changed a lot for\nme over the months, and\n\n446\n00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:48.918\nif I jump way back to February,\n\n447\n00:20:48.918 --> 00:20:53.090\nI don't have any Mac machines.\n\n448\n00:20:53.090 --> 00:20:55.010\nI've got several servers.\n\n449\n00:20:55.010 --> 00:20:57.350\nWhat show was I doing where\nI needed four servers?\n\n450\n00:20:57.350 --> 00:21:00.790\nBut I've got VMware server,\nXen server, Windows server, so\n\n451\n00:21:00.790 --> 00:21:04.130\nI've got a bunch of servers right here\nbecause I was doing another show.\n\n452\n00:21:04.130 --> 00:21:07.050\nSomething where I needed a bunch of\nservers versus now where it's different.\n\n453\n00:21:07.050 --> 00:21:08.850\nSo you can see how that looks and\nrestore back.\n\n454\n00:21:08.850 --> 00:21:10.070\nPretty cool stuff.\n\n455\n00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:12.790\nSo the back up we just saw I\nmean that works really well.\n\n456\n00:21:12.790 --> 00:21:14.130\nBut its got one weakness.\n\n457\n00:21:14.130 --> 00:21:15.980\nAnd the weakness is that external drive.\n\n458\n00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:18.920\nAnd we've already seen it with my system\nwhere I haven't done a back up since\n\n459\n00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:20.020\nyesterday morning.\n\n460\n00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:20.670\nAnd why is that?\n\n461\n00:21:20.670 --> 00:21:22.650\nI forgot to plug the drive in.\n\n462\n00:21:22.650 --> 00:21:24.690\nI didn't stick my laptop back\nin the docking station or\n\n463\n00:21:24.690 --> 00:21:27.030\nsomething like that caused\nit not to back up, right.\n\n464\n00:21:27.030 --> 00:21:29.940\nSo that's one of the big\nweaknesses that we have\n\n465\n00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:32.730\nwith regular time machine\nis this external drive.\n\n466\n00:21:32.730 --> 00:21:35.090\nSo what if we wanna shore that up?\n\n467\n00:21:35.090 --> 00:21:39.220\nWell, one of the best solutions that we\nhave is to do a network backup instead of\n\n468\n00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:40.900\nan individual local drive.\n\n469\n00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:43.570\nAnd I mentioned the time capsule\nat the beginning of the episode\n\n470\n00:21:43.570 --> 00:21:44.990\nthat works great, right?\n\n471\n00:21:44.990 --> 00:21:46.350\nI think they're $200 or $300.\n\n472\n00:21:46.350 --> 00:21:48.450\nYou buy it from Apple,\nit's a wireless access point and\n\n473\n00:21:48.450 --> 00:21:50.540\nrouter with hard drives in it.\n\n474\n00:21:50.540 --> 00:21:52.260\nAnd you stick it on your network.\n\n475\n00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:54.317\nAnd now when you bring your\nlaptop into the network and\n\n476\n00:21:54.317 --> 00:21:57.438\nit sees the wireless network, it sees\nthe Time Capsule and it starts backing up.\n\n477\n00:21:57.438 --> 00:22:00.453\nYou don't have to plug anything in, you\njust have to have it in the building and\n\n478\n00:22:00.453 --> 00:22:01.281\nthat's it, right?\n\n479\n00:22:01.281 --> 00:22:05.327\nIt's hard to forget that, now you'd\nhave to forget your whole laptop But\n\n480\n00:22:05.327 --> 00:22:08.050\nyou don't have to have a time capsule.\n\n481\n00:22:08.050 --> 00:22:11.780\nWe can actually set up a network\ntime machine storage location\n\n482\n00:22:11.780 --> 00:22:14.370\non any Mac that's running the server app.\n\n483\n00:22:14.370 --> 00:22:18.450\nThe server app allows you to become\na network storage repository for\n\n484\n00:22:18.450 --> 00:22:21.380\nbackups and\nit's actually pretty easy to get set up.\n\n485\n00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:24.800\nSo you can take any one of your Macs,\none that's preferably on all the time.\n\n486\n00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:27.950\nInstall the server app for\na blazing $20, and\n\n487\n00:22:27.950 --> 00:22:29.380\nthen fire up the time\nmachine service on it.\n\n488\n00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:30.760\nLet me show you how that works.\n\n489\n00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:36.160\nSo, I've got a server here, and it's just\na Mac that's running the server app, and\n\n490\n00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:39.190\nits got a 500 gig hard drive\nright here that I call Storage.\n\n491\n00:22:39.190 --> 00:22:40.300\nYou can call it whatever you want.\n\n492\n00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:41.200\nIt doesn't matter.\n\n493\n00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:43.350\nBut, you're going to have that storage and\n\n494\n00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:46.110\nyou're gonna set that up to\nbe a network time machine.\n\n495\n00:22:46.110 --> 00:22:49.160\nAnd all the devices on your network,\nnot one Mac, not two Macs, but\n\n496\n00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:52.420\nall the Macs on your network can\nsee this is a network location and\n\n497\n00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:56.640\nstart to back up to it so you have\na single place to go for all your backups.\n\n498\n00:22:56.640 --> 00:23:00.350\nAll right now, if we want to turn that on\nall we have to do is look right here in\n\n499\n00:23:00.350 --> 00:23:04.940\nthe OSX server in the server app,\nand you'll see over here on the left\n\n500\n00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:09.320\nthat there's a Time Machine service\nright here and I can choose a service.\n\n501\n00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:11.640\nAnd there's not a whole lot\nof configuration to it.\n\n502\n00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:14.300\nI'm gonna set who is allowed to backup.\n\n503\n00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:15.300\nThe default is everybody.\n\n504\n00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:18.110\nAnd then I'm gonna set\nthe backup destination.\n\n505\n00:23:18.110 --> 00:23:19.770\nWhere does the backup go?\n\n506\n00:23:19.770 --> 00:23:23.110\nAnd you need to pick somewhere\nthat got some space, right?\n\n507\n00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:26.394\nI need to pick, like,\nthat external driver, or an or\n\n508\n00:23:26.394 --> 00:23:29.370\nwhatever it is that I have that has\nenough storage for all of my backups.\n\n509\n00:23:29.370 --> 00:23:31.043\nAnd you have to think about that,\nright, think about capacity.\n\n510\n00:23:31.043 --> 00:23:33.981\nHow many machines are you going to back\nup, how much data do you want to save.\n\n511\n00:23:33.981 --> 00:23:36.872\nSo I'm going to hit the little\nplus sign in there and\n\n512\n00:23:36.872 --> 00:23:40.850\nI'm going to choose that storage\ndisk of mine, that 500 gig disk.\n\n513\n00:23:40.850 --> 00:23:44.740\nSo I'm going to pick that and you can\nlimit the amount of space for each backup.\n\n514\n00:23:44.740 --> 00:23:47.560\nThat way you don't have like one\nend user who goes rampant and\n\n515\n00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:49.030\nhas terabytes of data.\n\n516\n00:23:49.030 --> 00:23:50.810\nSo you can limit that if you want.\n\n517\n00:23:50.810 --> 00:23:52.600\nThe default is not to limit it.\n\n518\n00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:55.460\nEven if you do limit it,\npay attention to this note.\n\n519\n00:23:55.460 --> 00:23:59.257\nOnly Mavericks and higher so\n10.9 and higher will recognize that.\n\n520\n00:23:59.257 --> 00:24:02.192\nIf you're running 10.8 and earlier,\nthey'll ignore the limits,\n\n521\n00:24:02.192 --> 00:24:02.971\nkind of annoying.\n\n522\n00:24:02.971 --> 00:24:04.797\nBut that's how it works.\n\n523\n00:24:04.797 --> 00:24:07.074\nSo I'm gonna choose that and\nI'll hit Create.\n\n524\n00:24:07.074 --> 00:24:13.740\nAnd what it just did is it created a Time\nMachine backup database on my storage.\n\n525\n00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:18.500\nAnd if I open up Storage and look,\nI don't have backups.backupdb,\n\n526\n00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:20.790\nI have Shared Items.\n\n527\n00:24:20.790 --> 00:24:24.560\nAnd if I go into Shared Items, there's\nBackups, and inside of Backups, well,\n\n528\n00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:28.010\neventually there will be backups here,\nthat's why they named the folder that.\n\n529\n00:24:28.010 --> 00:24:30.600\nBut right now nobody's connected so\nI don't see that.\n\n530\n00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:32.390\nAll right, but\nwe're pretty much done here.\n\n531\n00:24:32.390 --> 00:24:34.880\nIf I go to the Backups tab,\nI can see I don't have any backups.\n\n532\n00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:36.870\nEverything is pretty much\nset the way I need it.\n\n533\n00:24:36.870 --> 00:24:38.830\nI'm just gonna hit the ON button, and\n\n534\n00:24:38.830 --> 00:24:42.550\nI'm now officially a network\nTime Machine backup.\n\n535\n00:24:42.550 --> 00:24:46.740\nOkay, once I've got that, I can jump\nback over to a client like this one,\n\n536\n00:24:48.850 --> 00:24:50.552\nand I can go into Time Machine.\n\n537\n00:24:50.552 --> 00:24:54.440\nAll right, and it's telling me I\nhaven't set up Time Machine yet, so\n\n538\n00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:56.200\nI'm gonna go ahead and set it up.\n\n539\n00:24:56.200 --> 00:25:00.580\nAnd when I do that, it's gonna show me\nthe screen where I pick my backup disk and\n\n540\n00:25:00.580 --> 00:25:05.210\nwhen I pick that, if I have an external\ndisk attached, I'll see it.\n\n541\n00:25:05.210 --> 00:25:08.530\nIf I have a Time Capsule, I'll see it or\n\n542\n00:25:08.530 --> 00:25:12.270\nif I have a network Time machine\nserver which is right there.\n\n543\n00:25:12.270 --> 00:25:13.080\nThat one showing up.\n\n544\n00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:14.750\nI see my OSX-SERVER01.\n\n545\n00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:16.720\nI'm gonna choose that.\n\n546\n00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:20.730\nI can still encrypt, still a good idea\nto encrypt on network storage cuz\n\n547\n00:25:20.730 --> 00:25:24.520\nsomebody else could access that on\nthe network and now your data's out.\n\n548\n00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:28.200\nAnd then I can just hit Use Disk and\nnow it's connecting to the server.\n\n549\n00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:30.410\nI've got to authenticate.\n\n550\n00:25:30.410 --> 00:25:34.820\nAnd I do have an account on that server,\nso I'll go ahead and connect.\n\n551\n00:25:34.820 --> 00:25:35.950\nThere it goes.\n\n552\n00:25:35.950 --> 00:25:38.650\nAnd so now it's connecting,\nit's showing about 500 gigs available.\n\n553\n00:25:38.650 --> 00:25:42.680\nThe next backup's gonna happen in 120\nseconds, in 2 minutes, it's gonna backup.\n\n554\n00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:46.500\nAnd the cool part here, I no longer\nhave to worry about plugging in a drive.\n\n555\n00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:48.920\nEverytime I bring this laptop into work or\nif it's a desktop,\n\n556\n00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:53.628\nit's gonna backup across the network to\nthat server and start backing up there.\n\n557\n00:25:53.628 --> 00:25:56.010\nNow, I'm gonna have to wait 100\nseconds before it shows up here.\n\n558\n00:25:56.010 --> 00:25:59.160\nBut once it does,\nI'll be able to go to Backups, and\n\n559\n00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:00.680\nthe backup will show right here.\n\n560\n00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:03.440\nAnd it's not gonna show\nup until it starts.\n\n561\n00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:06.430\nI guess we're gonna have\nto wait a minute there.\n\n562\n00:26:06.430 --> 00:26:08.510\nThat force start button there for us.\n\n563\n00:26:08.510 --> 00:26:11.122\nYeah, you don't really have that,\nit's not a good way to do it.\n\n564\n00:26:11.122 --> 00:26:14.500\nBut anyhow, so it runs automatic and\nthis really helps things.\n\n565\n00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:18.100\nWhile we're waiting on this,\nI talked about how we do restores, right?\n\n566\n00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:23.110\nAnd we saw me doing a restore of\na document from my Time Machine backup.\n\n567\n00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:24.400\nThat's one way to do a restore.\n\n568\n00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:26.580\nThere is another way that's\nworth mentioning here.\n\n569\n00:26:26.580 --> 00:26:30.400\nWhat if my hard drive fails and\nI have to go to a store and\n\n570\n00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:32.940\nbuy a blank hard drive and pop it in?\n\n571\n00:26:32.940 --> 00:26:35.010\nOkay, hard drive's blank.\n\n572\n00:26:35.010 --> 00:26:38.550\nHow can I get into Time Machine and\nrestore stuff?\n\n573\n00:26:38.550 --> 00:26:39.880\nThe answer is, you can't.\n\n574\n00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:42.740\nSo what you need to do\nis boot to recovery.\n\n575\n00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:45.010\nAnd if the hard drive is\nnot completely blank,\n\n576\n00:26:45.010 --> 00:26:49.040\nif it has the recovery partition on there,\nyou can power the computer on while\n\n577\n00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:53.590\nholding Command+R, and it'll boot recovery\nand you'll get into recovery mode.\n\n578\n00:26:53.590 --> 00:26:57.710\nIf the hard drive is truly blank,\nthe recovery partition is gone also.\n\n579\n00:26:57.710 --> 00:27:00.400\nAnd so when you hold Command+R,\nit'll do Internet recovery.\n\n580\n00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:04.280\nIt'll find Apple's servers, and it'll\ndownload the recovery image from there.\n\n581\n00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:06.356\nEither way, once you're in recovery,\n\n582\n00:27:06.356 --> 00:27:09.723\nmost of us jump straight to the option\nto install Mac OS X, right?\n\n583\n00:27:09.723 --> 00:27:13.090\nBut there's another option in there\nthat says restore from Time Machine.\n\n584\n00:27:13.090 --> 00:27:15.500\nAnd all you would have to do is\nplug in your external hard drive or\n\n585\n00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:17.170\nconnect to your network storage.\n\n586\n00:27:17.170 --> 00:27:18.740\nAnd choose that restore\nfrom Time Machine and\n\n587\n00:27:18.740 --> 00:27:22.790\nit will restore your entire system back,\nright through recovery mode.\n\n588\n00:27:22.790 --> 00:27:25.820\nSo if you ever have\na full hard drive loss,\n\n589\n00:27:25.820 --> 00:27:27.530\nthe Time Machine's got the whole thing.\n\n590\n00:27:27.530 --> 00:27:30.930\nSo the restore I did a few minutes ago is\nhow I would do it if I was missing a file\n\n591\n00:27:30.930 --> 00:27:32.470\nor missing a folder.\n\n592\n00:27:32.470 --> 00:27:34.020\nBut if I'm missing the whole machine,\n\n593\n00:27:34.020 --> 00:27:36.290\nwe're gonna want to go to recovery for\nthat.\n\n594\n00:27:36.290 --> 00:27:40.266\nNow Don, would this work as well with\nmaybe like a major operating system\n\n595\n00:27:40.266 --> 00:27:45.169\nupgrade where you're moving from, what was\nit, like Mavericks to El Capitan, right?\n\n596\n00:27:45.169 --> 00:27:47.608\nYou're like, okay, I'm making the jump,\nand you're like eh,\n\n597\n00:27:47.608 --> 00:27:50.483\nEl Capitan's not my cup of tea I want to\ngo back or maybe I'm having trouble with\n\n598\n00:27:50.483 --> 00:27:52.991\nsome software that's not truly\ncompatible and I want to jump back.\n\n599\n00:27:52.991 --> 00:27:54.700\nIs Time Machine good for that as well?\n\n600\n00:27:54.700 --> 00:27:56.660\nAbsolutely, in fact,\nI went through that myself.\n\n601\n00:27:56.660 --> 00:27:59.900\nWhen El Capitan first came out,\nI deployed it right away.\n\n602\n00:27:59.900 --> 00:28:02.050\nAnd it was running really well,\nso I said, all right, well,\n\n603\n00:28:02.050 --> 00:28:03.580\nlet me deploy it on my laptop.\n\n604\n00:28:03.580 --> 00:28:05.890\nWell, I use VMware Fusion a lot.\n\n605\n00:28:05.890 --> 00:28:08.600\nI use it for virtual machines for\nall the shows that I do.\n\n606\n00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:13.930\nAnd the early versions of El Capitan\nmade VMware Fusion run super slow.\n\n607\n00:28:13.930 --> 00:28:15.010\nIt was painful.\n\n608\n00:28:15.010 --> 00:28:17.650\nAnd so for the show, I couldn't have that.\n\n609\n00:28:17.650 --> 00:28:20.100\nI needed to roll my\nlaptop back to Yosemite.\n\n610\n00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:25.520\nAnd all I had to do was hook up my Time\nMachine drive and boot to recovery and\n\n611\n00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:30.130\ntell it to restore an image from\nbefore I upgraded to El Capitan.\n\n612\n00:28:30.130 --> 00:28:33.580\nAnd so, on Monday I'd upgraded to El\nCapitan, I restored a backup from Sunday.\n\n613\n00:28:33.580 --> 00:28:37.090\nAnd when I restored it, it booted up and\nI was back in Yosemite again.\n\n614\n00:28:37.090 --> 00:28:39.649\nIt can actually roll back\nthe operating system upgrade.\n\n615\n00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:45.540\nThe Time Machine backup\nis your entire data set,\n\n616\n00:28:45.540 --> 00:28:50.140\neverything, operating system, files,\nfolders, favorites, preferences.\n\n617\n00:28:50.140 --> 00:28:53.960\nAll of that is a part of it and\nyou can roll the whole thing back.\n\n618\n00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:55.740\nYour machine gets infected with a virus.\n\n619\n00:28:55.740 --> 00:28:58.610\nWell, you just roll back\nto that last backup and\n\n620\n00:28:58.610 --> 00:28:59.680\nnow you're not infected anymore.\n\n621\n00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:02.440\nSo it is a really great\nway to get about that.\n\n622\n00:29:03.690 --> 00:29:05.400\nAll right,\nlooks like my backup finally started.\n\n623\n00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:07.470\nI've already backed up\nabout 500 MBs of data.\n\n624\n00:29:07.470 --> 00:29:11.040\nThis backup's gonna run slower\nbecause it's over the network, right.\n\n625\n00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:14.007\nBacking up to direct attached storage is\nalways gonna be faster, but backing up,\n\n626\n00:29:14.007 --> 00:29:16.420\nhere it's telling me,\nis gonna take about 12 minutes.\n\n627\n00:29:16.420 --> 00:29:20.130\nBut if I jump back over to the server,\nhere we go.\n\n628\n00:29:20.130 --> 00:29:23.910\nI see OSX-CLIENT01, backup in progress.\n\n629\n00:29:23.910 --> 00:29:25.890\nIt's calculating what\nthe total size is gonna be.\n\n630\n00:29:25.890 --> 00:29:31.760\nAnd if I browsed that hard drive,\nI can go into Shared Items > Backups and\n\n631\n00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:34.190\nthere's a folder for OSX-CLIENT01.\n\n632\n00:29:34.190 --> 00:29:37.500\nIt gets its own folder because I might\nhave ten different computers backed up\n\n633\n00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:39.690\nhere, each one would\nhave their own folder.\n\n634\n00:29:39.690 --> 00:29:42.730\nAnd I know it doesn't look like a folder,\nbut it actually is.\n\n635\n00:29:42.730 --> 00:29:46.670\nIf we do Show Package Contents,\nyou can browse inside of it.\n\n636\n00:29:46.670 --> 00:29:49.760\nAnd here I start to see my\nTime Machine settings and\n\n637\n00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:51.620\nour backups are getting thrown into here.\n\n638\n00:29:51.620 --> 00:29:54.680\nSo we start to see all these\ndifferent backup files\n\n639\n00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:57.520\nthat are breaking that up by version.\n\n640\n00:29:57.520 --> 00:29:59.070\nSo it's all getting thrown in there.\n\n641\n00:29:59.070 --> 00:30:01.490\nNow I've got a network backup location.\n\n642\n00:30:01.490 --> 00:30:04.280\nAwesome, well Time Machine is definitely,\n\n643\n00:30:04.280 --> 00:30:05.870\nthis is something you need to be doing,\nright?\n\n644\n00:30:05.870 --> 00:30:07.200\nIt's obviously very easy to do.\n\n645\n00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:11.810\nThere's nothing too difficult about it and\nyou're really just doing yourself a favor\n\n646\n00:30:11.810 --> 00:30:13.670\nbecause one day you're\ngonna lose that file.\n\n647\n00:30:13.670 --> 00:30:15.680\nIt's happened to me,\nI know it's happened to Don.\n\n648\n00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:19.610\nAnybody that's used a computer for\nmore than maybe a year,\n\n649\n00:30:19.610 --> 00:30:24.390\nyou'll probably have experienced\nsome form of, no, that file is gone.\n\n650\n00:30:24.390 --> 00:30:26.240\nMy changes didn't get saved.\n\n651\n00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:27.250\nWhat do I do?\n\n652\n00:30:27.250 --> 00:30:30.040\nTime Machine is so\neasy to turn on and set up and\n\n653\n00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:32.290\nusing it is greatly to your advantage.\n\n654\n00:30:32.290 --> 00:30:35.100\nDon, is there anything else about\nTime Machine that you want to explain to\n\n655\n00:30:35.100 --> 00:30:35.880\nhow we can use it?\n\n656\n00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:38.410\nSo as far as backup and\nrestore, that was it, but\n\n657\n00:30:38.410 --> 00:30:41.270\nwe can actually use the Time Machine for\nother things too.\n\n658\n00:30:41.270 --> 00:30:44.170\nIf any of you watched\nthe migration episode,\n\n659\n00:30:44.170 --> 00:30:46.440\nI mentioned Time Machine\nvery briefly in there.\n\n660\n00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:50.610\nLet's say that my laptop's perfectly fine,\nhard drive's not bad or anything.\n\n661\n00:30:50.610 --> 00:30:51.640\nBut I get a new one.\n\n662\n00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:55.150\nA nice, new shiny Macbook comes out,\nso I decide I'm gonna upgrade.\n\n663\n00:30:55.150 --> 00:30:58.210\nI need to move my data from my\nold Macbook to my new Macbook.\n\n664\n00:30:58.210 --> 00:30:59.290\nHow do I move the data?\n\n665\n00:30:59.290 --> 00:31:00.960\nWell, there's a couple of different ways,\nbut\n\n666\n00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:03.910\none of the easiest ways is to\ntake a Time Machine backup.\n\n667\n00:31:03.910 --> 00:31:06.360\nTake a Time Machine back up, and\nthen you can take that hard drive and\n\n668\n00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:07.500\nhook it up to your new computer.\n\n669\n00:31:08.620 --> 00:31:11.530\nAnd on your new computer you can\nrun the Migration Assistant.\n\n670\n00:31:11.530 --> 00:31:13.150\nLet me run it here real quick.\n\n671\n00:31:13.150 --> 00:31:16.410\nSo if I run the Migration Assistant,\nright,\n\n672\n00:31:16.410 --> 00:31:19.590\nand I did this in the migration episode so\nif you haven't seen it, it's there.\n\n673\n00:31:19.590 --> 00:31:22.610\nBut when you fire up\nthe Migration Assistant,\n\n674\n00:31:22.610 --> 00:31:27.490\nit's really designed to help you migrate\nfrom Windows to Mac or whatever.\n\n675\n00:31:27.490 --> 00:31:32.200\nBut one of the options in there is\nthat it can use a Time Machine backup\n\n676\n00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:32.960\nas the source.\n\n677\n00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:34.930\nAnd we'll see it appear\nhere in just a second.\n\n678\n00:31:34.930 --> 00:31:40.490\nAnd so I can say, migrate from this\nTime Machine backup to this computer.\n\n679\n00:31:40.490 --> 00:31:44.580\nSo see how it says right here as a source,\nFrom a Mac, Time Machine backup or\n\n680\n00:31:44.580 --> 00:31:45.690\nstartup disk.\n\n681\n00:31:45.690 --> 00:31:49.380\nSo I can take a Time Machine backup from\nmy old computer, hook it up to the new\n\n682\n00:31:49.380 --> 00:31:54.960\ncomputer, run the Migration Assistant, and\nchoose that I want to do this from a Mac.\n\n683\n00:31:54.960 --> 00:32:01.360\nAnd then when I move forward, it's\nlooking, and see how it sees OSX-Server01?\n\n684\n00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:03.590\nIt knows that's a Time Machine source.\n\n685\n00:32:03.590 --> 00:32:06.470\nAnd so I can choose that, and\nsay that's gonna be the source of my data,\n\n686\n00:32:06.470 --> 00:32:08.040\nmy Time Machine backup.\n\n687\n00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:10.640\nAnd I can continue forward, and.\n\n688\n00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:13.530\nWell, I gotta give it a user account to be\nable to access and my backup's not done,\n\n689\n00:32:13.530 --> 00:32:14.460\nso it's gonna break.\n\n690\n00:32:14.460 --> 00:32:18.150\nBut you can point to that and\nit'll put your documents, your wallpaper,\n\n691\n00:32:18.150 --> 00:32:20.672\nyour preferences,\nyour various things like that.\n\n692\n00:32:20.672 --> 00:32:22.560\nIt's gonna put them all\non the new machine.\n\n693\n00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:26.600\nInstead of having to restore the old OS,\nhere it's just restoring your data.\n\n694\n00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:31.278\nSo that's another way we can use\nthe Time Machine software to really make\n\n695\n00:32:31.278 --> 00:32:33.050\nthings convenient for us.\n\n696\n00:32:33.050 --> 00:32:35.370\nIt's really flexible stuff,\nit's built into the OS,\n\n697\n00:32:35.370 --> 00:32:37.230\nthere's no reason not to use it.\n\n698\n00:32:37.230 --> 00:32:38.250\nIt's only gonna help you.\n\n699\n00:32:38.250 --> 00:32:40.490\nYeah, that is actually very sweet.\n\n700\n00:32:40.490 --> 00:32:42.000\nA computer gets old, right?\n\n701\n00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:43.900\nIt's time to upgrade,\ntime to get new hardware.\n\n702\n00:32:43.900 --> 00:32:45.090\nYou get the new hardware.\n\n703\n00:32:45.090 --> 00:32:48.340\nMan I wish I had all my old\nsettings cuz that is a pain\n\n704\n00:32:48.340 --> 00:32:50.590\nif you've ever had to\ndo a manual migration.\n\n705\n00:32:50.590 --> 00:32:53.440\nJust jump on,\nuse that Time Machine server.\n\n706\n00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:54.124\nBoot it right to that,\n\n707\n00:32:54.124 --> 00:32:55.890\ncuz you get everything restored\nright to the way you were.\n\n708\n00:32:55.890 --> 00:32:59.043\nNow you've got the better hardware\nplus your old familiar desktop.\n\n709\n00:32:59.043 --> 00:33:00.350\nAwesome stuff Don.\n\n710\n00:33:00.350 --> 00:33:01.290\nYou mentioned booting,\n\n711\n00:33:01.290 --> 00:33:04.450\nanother thing that I forgot is,\nwhen you backup to a hard drive and\n\n712\n00:33:04.450 --> 00:33:08.060\nmake it a Time Machine drive, Apple, they\ndon't go out of their way to say this,\n\n713\n00:33:08.060 --> 00:33:12.210\nbut they actually put a copy of your\nrecovery partition on that drive also.\n\n714\n00:33:12.210 --> 00:33:16.470\nSo the scenario I gave earlier of where\nyou have a completely blank hard drive,\n\n715\n00:33:16.470 --> 00:33:19.680\nyou could hook up your Time Machine\nbackup, turn your computer on\n\n716\n00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:24.210\nwhile holding the Alt key, and it'll\nsee the Time Machine drive as bootable.\n\n717\n00:33:24.210 --> 00:33:27.820\nAnd you can actually boot recovery\nfrom the Time Machine drive and\n\n718\n00:33:27.820 --> 00:33:29.620\nthen restore your Time Machine\nbackup to the hard drive.\n\n719\n00:33:29.620 --> 00:33:31.310\nSo just another really cool thing,\n\n720\n00:33:31.310 --> 00:33:34.330\nApple's really thought this one through,\nthere's some good stuff in there.\n\n721\n00:33:34.330 --> 00:33:37.491\nYeah, it's definitely the crown\njewel of some of their software.\n\n722\n00:33:37.491 --> 00:33:40.450\nVery, very nice stuff and\nsuper easy to use.\n\n723\n00:33:40.450 --> 00:33:44.680\nSo don't be afraid of it, jump in, use it,\nturn it on, make sure that it's enabled.\n\n724\n00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:45.750\nDon, anything else?\n\n725\n00:33:45.750 --> 00:33:48.980\nObviously it's the China or\nthe Russian doll.\n\n726\n00:33:48.980 --> 00:33:52.520\nWe keep opening and there's more and\nmore cool stuff inside.\n\n727\n00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:55.430\nThere's plenty more that we'll get into\nwhen we get into the server shows.\n\n728\n00:33:55.430 --> 00:33:57.690\nBut for now, that's enough that\nwe need for the workstations.\n\n729\n00:33:57.690 --> 00:34:00.280\nWe actually went a little bit beyond\nwhat's in the integration basics exam.\n\n730\n00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:02.940\nBut it's good stuff, definitely\nsomething you'll implement in real life.\n\n731\n00:34:02.940 --> 00:34:04.360\nAll right, well Don thanks so much for\n\n732\n00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:06.830\nstopping by,\nshowing us how to use Time Machine.\n\n733\n00:34:06.830 --> 00:34:09.890\nObviously, yet again,\nsuch a great tool for us to use.\n\n734\n00:34:09.890 --> 00:34:13.580\nSo get in there and use it,\nlearn how to abuse it if you can, and\n\n735\n00:34:13.580 --> 00:34:16.010\nhave a good time with it and\nkeep your data safe.\n\n736\n00:34:16.010 --> 00:34:17.920\nThat being said it's time to sign off.\n\n737\n00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:20.480\nFor ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n738\n00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:21.160\nAnd I'm Don Pezet.\n\n739\n00:34:21.160 --> 00:34:22.542\nAnd we'll see you next time.\n\n740\n00:34:22.542 --> 00:34:28.389\n[SOUND]\n\n",

another great\nepisode of ITPRO.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.452 --> 00:00:18.994\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\nin today's episode,\n\n5\n00:00:18.994 --> 00:00:21.931\nwe are moving forward with our\nMac integration basics series.\n\n6\n00:00:21.931 --> 00:00:25.899\nJoining us back in the studio today to be\nour guiding star in that endeavor is none\n\n7\n00:00:25.899 --> 00:00:28.170\nother than our good friend, Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n8\n00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.490\nDon, welcome back to the show, sir.\n\n9\n00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:30.520\n>> Thanks for having me back, Daniel,\n\n10\n00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.650\nI'm excited to jump into this one\nbecause we're gonna be taking a look at\n\n11\n00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:37.310\novercoming one of the big obstacles that\npeople have with switching over to a Mac.\n\n12\n00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:40.714\nSo one of the things I hear a lot is that\npeople have been using Windows computers\n\n13\n00:00:40.714 --> 00:00:41.435\nfor a long time,\n\n14\n00:00:41.435 --> 00:00:44.442\nyou have a lot of line of business\napplications that work in Windows.\n\n15\n00:00:44.442 --> 00:00:47.890\nAnd so you don't wanna move to a Mac.\n\n16\n00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.140\nSomebody says, I'm not gonna switch\nto a Mac, it'd be too hard and\n\n17\n00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:51.990\nthey don't have the software that I need.\n\n18\n00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:54.260\nWell, that certainly can be true.\n\n19\n00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.490\nThere is some software that\nis only available on Windows,\n\n20\n00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:58.150\nthat's not available on a Mac.\n\n21\n00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.500\nAnd it is certainly an encouraging\nreason to just stay on Windows,\n\n22\n00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.990\nand not to do anything different, right?\n\n23\n00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:06.960\nBut, it's not really\na great excuse anymore.\n\n24\n00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.120\nBecause there are ways that we can get\nthat Windows applications to run on\n\n25\n00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:11.460\nour Mac.\n\n26\n00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.400\nAnd even do it really really reliable.\n\n27\n00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.950\nIt's not so\nreliable ways that are out there.\n\n28\n00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.580\nAnd free ways that just don't really work.\n\n29\n00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.160\nBut there's other technologies.\n\n30\n00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:21.720\nBut what's we're gonna\nsee here in this episode,\n\n31\n00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.050\nin our next episode is\nhow do we overcome that?\n\n32\n00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:28.220\nHow do we overcome when there's no\ncorresponding application in Mac\n\n33\n00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.960\nthat works, you know,\nfrom our Windows environment, right?\n\n34\n00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.480\nSo, it gets a little confusing.\n\n35\n00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:33.580\nLet me give you an example.\n\n36\n00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.330\nRight.\nA great example is QuickBooks.\n\n37\n00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:37.560\nInuit QuickBooks.\n\n38\n00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.420\nThere are a lot of businesses out\nthere that run QuickBooks, and\n\n39\n00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:41.850\nuse it to manage their accounting.\n\n40\n00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.910\nWell, there's a Windows version of\nQuickBooks that's really, really good.\n\n41\n00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:48.770\nAnd for a little while there was a Mac\nversion of QuickBooks that was really,\n\n42\n00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:49.940\nreally bad.\n\n43\n00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.570\nAnd what the guys at Intuit finally\ndid is they said you know what?\n\n44\n00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.640\nForget this, we're not gonna develop for\na bunch of different platforms.\n\n45\n00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.380\nWe're gonna make it web based.\n\n46\n00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.520\nYou can go to our webpage and\nyou can use it there.\n\n47\n00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.240\nBut if you wanna run QuickBooks yourself,\nwell you need Windows.\n\n48\n00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.880\nThat's what it runs under.\n\n49\n00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:05.750\nMicrosoft Office.\n\n50\n00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.900\nIt's gotten a lot better with\nthe latest version of Office.\n\n51\n00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:13.850\nBut in the past,\nif you compared Microsoft Office 2000\n\n52\n00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:17.122\nto Microsoft Office 2011 on a Mac.\n\n53\n00:02:17.122 --> 00:02:21.320\nBut 2000 version of Office was\nway better than 2011 on a Mac.\n\n54\n00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:26.440\nThe Mac one was always so far behind on\nfeatures, and it just wasn't the same.\n\n55\n00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.390\nIt was a crippled or damaged version\n\n56\n00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.550\nbecause it was developed by an entirely\nseparate team at Microsoft's headquarters,\n\n57\n00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.150\nand they really just weren't\nputting a lot of effort into it.\n\n58\n00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.400\nThey worked really hard to\nfix that in newer versions.\n\n59\n00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.070\nBut the older versions were\ndefinitely not that way.\n\n60\n00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:42.020\nAdobe Photoshop, right?\n\n61\n00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:48.150\nAdobe Photoshop, it used to be that\nAdobe would develop it on a Mac,\n\n62\n00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:49.650\nand then port it over to Windows.\n\n63\n00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.660\nAnd so if you were a graphics designer,\n\n64\n00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:56.590\nyou wanted to run that on a Mac because\nthat's when you got the best one.\n\n65\n00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.780\nAdobe switched and now they develop on\nWindows first and port over to the Mac.\n\n66\n00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.274\nAnd it's starting to become\na little bit of a different world.\n\n67\n00:03:01.274 --> 00:03:05.429\nAnd so there's sometimes some new features\nthat come out on Windows that aren't out\n\n68\n00:03:05.429 --> 00:03:07.785\non the Mac side yet, but\na lot of them are close.\n\n69\n00:03:07.785 --> 00:03:10.525\nAnd so when it comes to Adobe Photoshop,\n\n70\n00:03:10.525 --> 00:03:14.890\nswitching from a Mac to a windows\nnot normally that big of a deal.\n\n71\n00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.690\nWe can just jump right in and off we go.\n\n72\n00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:23.140\nBut sometimes there's no compatibility\nwhatsoever, like Microsoft Vizio.\n\n73\n00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.510\nMicrosoft Vizio is a graphics program\nwe can use to create maps and diagrams.\n\n74\n00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:32.210\nIt works really well, I really like it but\nit only runs on Windows.\n\n75\n00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:33.440\nOr even some free software!\n\n76\n00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.414\nLike let me fire up Safari here.\n\n77\n00:03:36.414 --> 00:03:37.467\nNotepad++.\n\n78\n00:03:37.467 --> 00:03:43.320\nIf you've never heard Notepad++, it's\na little text editor that I really like,\n\n79\n00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:46.520\nand in the Windows world, it's free.\n\n80\n00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:47.300\nYou can download it.\n\n81\n00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:48.340\nYou can install it.\n\n82\n00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:51.810\nIt's got tab based editing and\nsyntax highlighting and all that stuff.\n\n83\n00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.530\nIt's a great product except\nthat only runs on Windows.\n\n84\n00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:56.720\nThere is no Mac.\n\n85\n00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:57.920\nMac version of it, right?\n\n86\n00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:02.070\nThey do distribute source code for it,\nI believe, but they don't compile it for\n\n87\n00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:04.000\nMac, so if you want that,\nyou're kinda out of luck.\n\n88\n00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.520\nOr are you?\n\n89\n00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:10.740\nIf the vendor has a corresponding product,\nAdobe Photoshop, Microsoft Office,\n\n90\n00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:13.890\nwe can always run their version of the\nsoftware on Mac, and you're fine, right?\n\n91\n00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:16.940\nYou just find the corresponding software,\nthey match up, and you're done.\n\n92\n00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:22.220\nBut if they don't have support from Mac OS\nlike notepad++ here, I'm gonna need\n\n93\n00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:26.110\nto go a different route, and certainly\none route is I just stay with Windows.\n\n94\n00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:29.600\nProblem solved right,\nI got notepad++, I'm safe right?\n\n95\n00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:34.670\nBut if I want it to run on a Mac,\nI can't, I can't get it to run natively.\n\n96\n00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:36.460\nApple doesn't give us the tools for that.\n\n97\n00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:38.290\nBut this is where third\nparty providers come in.\n\n98\n00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:41.230\nThere's plenty of third party solutions\nout there that help us to run this\n\n99\n00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:42.720\nsoftware, right?\n\n100\n00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:49.510\nOne solution that's out there is a\nsoftware product called Crossover, right?\n\n101\n00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:54.450\nIt's from a group called, it's actually\nCodeWeavers, is the company, but\n\n102\n00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:56.370\nCrossover Over is the product, so\n\n103\n00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:00.950\nlet me just do a quick search here for\nCodeWeavers CrossOver.\n\n104\n00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:03.520\nI gotta try and remember,\nthe name gets a little challenging.\n\n105\n00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:07.200\nBut this product, what it does,\nlet me make this a little bit bigger,\n\n106\n00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:10.420\nI'm kind of running it in\nthe world's smallest window here.\n\n107\n00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:16.020\nBut what it does is, it runs like\na virtualized Windows layer on your Mac.\n\n108\n00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:19.380\nAnd you can then run Windows\nsoftware on top of it.\n\n109\n00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:23.650\nAnd these guys what they're doing is\nthey're constantly reverse-engineering\n\n110\n00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:26.930\nthe Windows operating system and figuring\nout all the API calls that Windows\n\n111\n00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:31.170\nsupports, and then recreating\nthose to make them work on a Mac.\n\n112\n00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:32.280\nAnd they also do Linux, too.\n\n113\n00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.360\nSo it's Mac and Linux from these guys.\n\n114\n00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:36.520\nThese are the same people\nthat developed Wine.\n\n115\n00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:39.150\nWine is a, I'm gonna call it an emulator,\n\n116\n00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:42.090\nalthough Wine stands for\nWine is not an emulator.\n\n117\n00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:47.630\nBut it is basically an emulator that\nis taking the Windows API calls,\n\n118\n00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:50.950\nand making them work on Linux,\nor making them work on a Mac.\n\n119\n00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:55.570\nIt's translating them into the official\nMac or Linux calls so things function.\n\n120\n00:05:55.570 --> 00:06:00.100\nSo that your Windows software can run\nregardless of the operating system\n\n121\n00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:00.780\nthat's underneath it.\n\n122\n00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:03.500\nNow, CrossOver, I use it for\nmyself for a few things.\n\n123\n00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:08.450\nBut the way that it works is It just\n\n124\n00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:13.710\nsimulates these calls, and so\nyou can run the native Windows software.\n\n125\n00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:19.150\nBut the problem is, with crossover,\nif they haven't supported all the calls,\n\n126\n00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:20.940\nThe software becomes unstable.\n\n127\n00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:24.010\nThings can crash,\nthings can not work properly.\n\n128\n00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:26.840\nSome functions might work,\nsome functions might not.\n\n129\n00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:30.570\nSo, for example, if I take Crossover, see,\nhere's Crossover, I've got it installed.\n\n130\n00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:34.570\nThen you can see where I've got\nMicrosoft Visio and Microsoft Project.\n\n131\n00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:39.810\nThere is no Microsoft Visio for Mac,\nthere is no Microsoft Project for Mac.\n\n132\n00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:42.470\nSo I can run it in Crossover,\nand it will run, but\n\n133\n00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:44.910\nnotice how I'm running Project 2010,\nI'm running Visio 2010.\n\n134\n00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:47.090\nWhat if I wanna run 2013?\n\n135\n00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:49.240\nWhat if I wanna run the new ones,\nthe 2016s?\n\n136\n00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:53.570\nCrossover doesn't support it yet,\nthey haven't built in support for\n\n137\n00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:55.010\nall those API calls.\n\n138\n00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:58.550\nSo some software works great Some\nsoftware doesn't work at all.\n\n139\n00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:01.430\nAnd if I wanna come in here and\nadd some new software.\n\n140\n00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:04.640\nSo if I'm gonna add a new,\nthey call them bottles.\n\n141\n00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:06.870\nRight here,\nI can do install a Windows application.\n\n142\n00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:11.340\nThey've got a number that they\nalready support including Notepad++.\n\n143\n00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:14.470\nAnd I can choose that, and\nhere it says it runs great.\n\n144\n00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:18.590\nThey've tested it and it runs great,\nwe can continue and get this installed.\n\n145\n00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:20.740\nAnd it's gonna install and build it up and\n\n146\n00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:24.790\nI'll be able to run Notepad ++ right\nhere on top of my Mac, all right?\n\n147\n00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:27.850\nFor simple software,\nsoftware that doesn't do anything crazy or\n\n148\n00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:29.450\nadvanced, this works out.\n\n149\n00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:33.150\nAnd I'll be able to run Notepad\n++ right here on top of my Mac.\n\n150\n00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:36.610\nHere I see the installer, and so I'm going\nto run through the installer just like I\n\n151\n00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:39.530\nwas on Windows I'm gonna read all of this.\n\n152\n00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:42.610\nIt's gonna install of this\ndifferent features, and\n\n153\n00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:45.760\nI'm just gonna leave it all\ndefaults here and let it install.\n\n154\n00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:46.870\nSo it's installing.\n\n155\n00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:51.940\nNow Notepad++ thinks it's running\non top of Windows, but is it?\n\n156\n00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:52.460\nNo.\n\n157\n00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:56.487\nEvery time it goes to talk to Windows,\ncrossover is intercepting that.\n\n158\n00:07:56.487 --> 00:08:01.103\nAnd putting it in contact with Mac OS and\nhiding that fact that it is Mac OS.\n\n159\n00:08:01.103 --> 00:08:03.204\nNotepad++ thinks.\n\n160\n00:08:03.204 --> 00:08:05.712\nThat it's running on Windows.\n\n161\n00:08:05.712 --> 00:08:10.610\nAnd so when we launch it, here it goes,\nI'm now running Notepad++.\n\n162\n00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:13.010\nBut things get a little weird\nwhen we're running this way.\n\n163\n00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:17.140\nSo for example,\nif I create a new document and\n\n164\n00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:20.800\nI start typing,\nthis is my document, right?\n\n165\n00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:25.942\nIf I go to save it, well,\nit sees the Notepad++ folder.\n\n166\n00:08:25.942 --> 00:08:28.720\nIt thinks that's where it's gonna save,\nand if I go and\n\n167\n00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:33.280\nstart browsing around, my folder\nstructure gets a little bit weird.\n\n168\n00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:33.890\nRight?\n\n169\n00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:37.100\nAnd things don't necessarily match up\nquite the way that we want them to\n\n170\n00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:40.790\nbecause, at the end of the day,\nit thinks it's on Windows, but\n\n171\n00:08:40.790 --> 00:08:41.820\nit's actually on a Mac.\n\n172\n00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:44.300\nThings don't quite sync up just right.\n\n173\n00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:48.400\nThis offer actually works fine,\nthere's other software like Visio and\n\n174\n00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:51.720\nProject where I've had them running\non Crossover and after ten or\n\n175\n00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:54.520\n15 minutes they just crash and they close\nand they go away and you lose your data,\n\n176\n00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:56.360\nand boy, does it make me angry.\n\n177\n00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:59.420\nSo these types of compatibility\nlayers like Crossover and\n\n178\n00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:04.210\nWine, they work, but they're not\nreally good for production use,\n\n179\n00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:08.190\nthey're just not stable enough, and if any\nof you guys out there in TV land work for\n\n180\n00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:11.020\nthe Codeweavers Team, I'm sorry but\nthat's just the reality of it.\n\n181\n00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:13.860\nIf you wanna try and get something\nrunning that way you can, but\n\n182\n00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:15.480\nat the end of the day it's not perfect.\n\n183\n00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:16.120\nRight?\n\n184\n00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:20.440\nThey can't keep up with all of the API\nhooks that Microsoft creates, because\n\n185\n00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:24.820\nevery day Microsoft is creating new ones\nand the Codeweavers team is a small team.\n\n186\n00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:27.170\nIt's impossible to keep up, right?\n\n187\n00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:31.210\nSo if we want true compatibility,\nif I want real compatibility,\n\n188\n00:09:31.210 --> 00:09:34.110\nbe able to run this application, have it\nrun stable and have it production ready,\n\n189\n00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:38.500\nI need an emulator,\nI need a virtualization platform.\n\n190\n00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:43.120\nAnd all Apple hardware that's\non sale today has support for\n\n191\n00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:46.270\nvirtualization technology,\nyou just need software to manage it.\n\n192\n00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:48.440\nThere's free software,\nthere's paid software.\n\n193\n00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:50.280\nOne of the biggest free\nproducts that's out there,\n\n194\n00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:51.970\nlet me just get out of Cross Over here.\n\n195\n00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:58.470\nOne of the biggest ones that's\nout there is Virtual Box.\n\n196\n00:09:58.470 --> 00:10:01.870\nVirtual Box is actually\ncreated by Oracle and\n\n197\n00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:05.480\nit was created independently originally,\nOracle acquired them.\n\n198\n00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:10.250\nBut what Virtual Box does is it\nallows you to run Windows, or\n\n199\n00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:13.560\nLinux, on top of your Mac.\n\n200\n00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:17.980\nSo you've got your Mac OS running, and now\nyou've got Windows running, side by side.\n\n201\n00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:20.410\nThe nice thing about\nVirtualBox is that it's free.\n\n202\n00:10:20.410 --> 00:10:21.230\nDoesn't cost you a dime.\n\n203\n00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:22.420\nYou can download it, install it.\n\n204\n00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:25.820\nAnd you can get Windows and\nLinux machines up and running, no problem.\n\n205\n00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:26.590\nAll right.\n\n206\n00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:30.470\nBut because it's free,\nit's not as feature rich as some of\n\n207\n00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:32.890\nthe other virtualization\nplatforms that are out there.\n\n208\n00:10:32.890 --> 00:10:36.780\nPersonally, even here in the show,\nI use VMWare Fusion.\n\n209\n00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:44.470\nVMWare Fusion is not free, I think it\ncosts $80 for the personal version.\n\n210\n00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:45.990\nLike, if you just go and\nbuy the personal version it's $80.\n\n211\n00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:50.000\nThe version I use is the Pro\nversion which is, I believe, $120.\n\n212\n00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.165\nSo it's not free,\nit's not even cheap, right?\n\n213\n00:10:52.165 --> 00:10:52.810\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n214\n00:10:52.810 --> 00:10:54.140\n>> 120 bucks, I gotta pay for it.\n\n215\n00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:56.700\nBut it is very robust.\n\n216\n00:10:56.700 --> 00:11:00.420\nIt has a lot of great features in it,\na lot of bells and whistles.\n\n217\n00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:03.910\nAnd let's find out how much it actually\nis so I can tell you a real price.\n\n218\n00:11:03.910 --> 00:11:06.380\nSo it's $80 for the regular version.\n\n219\n00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:08.730\nAnd then if we go to the Pro,\nit's another $50.\n\n220\n00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:11.190\nSo it ends up being $130\nif you want to Pro version.\n\n221\n00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:13.860\nMost people just need the regular one,\nand it's 80 bucks.\n\n222\n00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:17.900\nBut once you've got it, you can start\nrunning other operating systems.\n\n223\n00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:21.620\nAnd I'm not talking about\npieces of the operating system,\n\n224\n00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:23.270\nlike what Crossover does.\n\n225\n00:11:23.270 --> 00:11:26.410\nI'm taking about the whole\nstinking operating system.\n\n226\n00:11:26.410 --> 00:11:30.100\nEvery bit of it, so\nwhen you run your software, it is\n\n227\n00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:34.460\ntruly running under that platform, not\nrunning under some kind of virtual subset.\n\n228\n00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:38.550\nAnd so the software works just as well as\nif it was installed on the native machine.\n\n229\n00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:41.390\n>> So Don, you would say that\nthe software then really is\n\n230\n00:11:41.390 --> 00:11:44.820\nstill not compatible with\nthe Mac operating system.\n\n231\n00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:45.990\nSo I don't know this.\n\n232\n00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:47.190\nI can't work with this.\n\n233\n00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:48.780\nWe're giving it another platform,\n\n234\n00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:51.580\nwhich it is compatible with,\non which to run, right?\n\n235\n00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:54.690\n>> Absolutely, yep, so let's say,\nfor example, I wanted Notepad++.\n\n236\n00:11:54.690 --> 00:11:59.280\nBut I tried it under CrossOver, and\nit crashed, something didn't work out.\n\n237\n00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:01.630\nSo I say, all right, well,\nlet's run it natively under Windows.\n\n238\n00:12:01.630 --> 00:12:03.090\nI need a Windows machine.\n\n239\n00:12:03.090 --> 00:12:03.850\nBut I'm on a Mac.\n\n240\n00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:06.880\nAnd I don't wanna format it,\nI wanna run Mac OS.\n\n241\n00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:09.210\nI just need Notepad++ to work, right?\n\n242\n00:12:09.210 --> 00:12:14.120\nSo I can create a Windows machine that's\nvirtual, that runs on top of Mac OS.\n\n243\n00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:15.600\nSo let me show you how I would do that.\n\n244\n00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:17.950\nI would take VMware Fusion, whoops.\n\n245\n00:12:17.950 --> 00:12:23.100\nActually hang on a second, let me get\ninto my My Virtual Machine Library,\n\n246\n00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:24.750\nthat's where I wanna be, there we go.\n\n247\n00:12:24.750 --> 00:12:29.940\nI can take VMWare Fusion and\nI can create a new virtual machine,\n\n248\n00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:33.820\nand so I'm gonna whip up a new machine\nhere, and it's gonna ask me, hey, I'm\n\n249\n00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:37.810\ngonna create a new computer for you and\nwe need to install an operating system.\n\n250\n00:12:37.810 --> 00:12:39.860\nWhere can we get that\noperating system from?\n\n251\n00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:44.200\nAnd so it needs an image,\na DVD or a USB installer or\n\n252\n00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:46.560\nsomething where it can get\nthe operating system from.\n\n253\n00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:50.070\nSo if you have a Windows installer disk,\nyou can pop that in,\n\n254\n00:12:50.070 --> 00:12:54.130\nalthough in my laptop I don't have\na removable media bay like that.\n\n255\n00:12:54.130 --> 00:12:58.180\nSo I'm gonna need to provide an ISO image\nand you can get ISO images from Microsoft.\n\n256\n00:12:58.180 --> 00:13:00.860\nAnd I'm saying Windows,\nthis could be Linux too, right?\n\n257\n00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:04.660\nSo you can get ISO images from any of\nthe Linux distros that are out there.\n\n258\n00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:07.890\nSo I'm gonna install from a disk image.\n\n259\n00:13:07.890 --> 00:13:10.300\nAnd, I've got one laying\non my hard drive right now.\n\n260\n00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:12.200\nYou just need to browse and\nfind the one that you've got.\n\n261\n00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:14.950\nSo I'm gonna take a Windows\n10 image on this one.\n\n262\n00:13:14.950 --> 00:13:16.420\nAnd I'll go ahead and move forward.\n\n263\n00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:18.790\nAnd it's gonna start what's\ncalled an easy install.\n\n264\n00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:22.310\nVMware Fusion will already create my\nuser account and set up those things for\n\n265\n00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:25.626\nme, so I'm gonna let it do that just\nto make my life a little bit easier.\n\n266\n00:13:27.808 --> 00:13:30.030\nAnd it needs a Windows Product Key.\n\n267\n00:13:30.030 --> 00:13:31.640\nI'm gonna leave that blank for now.\n\n268\n00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:35.150\nAnd we'll choose to do Windows 10 Pro.\n\n269\n00:13:35.150 --> 00:13:39.872\n>> I do like that how about the VM Fusion,\nthey want a product key.\n\n270\n00:13:39.872 --> 00:13:41.953\nBut if you don't have one, or\nyou've misplaced it, and you're like,\n\n271\n00:13:41.953 --> 00:13:43.340\nI just wanna get this installed then.\n\n272\n00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:45.690\nYou can move forward without it and\nstill get it installed.\n\n273\n00:13:45.690 --> 00:13:47.980\n>> Yeah, it'll just install as\nlike an evaluation version.\n\n274\n00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:50.850\nAnd I'll have to activate it after 60\ndays or 90 days, something like that.\n\n275\n00:13:50.850 --> 00:13:55.160\nAll right, now, it's asking me if\nI wanna go seamless or isolated.\n\n276\n00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:57.970\nI'm gonna choose isolated for now, I'll\nexplain the difference here in a minute.\n\n277\n00:13:57.970 --> 00:14:00.770\nBut for right now, I'm just gonna do\nisolated and I'll continue forward.\n\n278\n00:14:00.770 --> 00:14:02.810\nAnd then you're gonna see\nwhat it's going to do.\n\n279\n00:14:02.810 --> 00:14:04.810\nIt's going to create a Windows 10 machine.\n\n280\n00:14:04.810 --> 00:14:07.240\nIt's gonna give it two gigs of RAM.\n\n281\n00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:11.540\nIt's gonna give it 60 gigs of hard\ndrive space what's it talking about?\n\n282\n00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:14.320\nWell, it's gonna create\na virtual set of hardware.\n\n283\n00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:18.500\nIt's gonna create a fake\ncomputer inside of my Mac, right?\n\n284\n00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:21.380\nWhat the virtualization software\nis is what's called a hypervisor.\n\n285\n00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:25.260\nAnd the hypervisor can build fake hardware\n\n286\n00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:27.700\nthat this operating system's\ngonna think is real.\n\n287\n00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:29.980\nWindows is gonna think\nthat it has real hardware,\n\n288\n00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:34.530\nwhen in reality, It just has a subset of\nthe hardware that my Mac is already using.\n\n289\n00:14:34.530 --> 00:14:38.310\nSo, I have 16 gigs of ram in my laptop.\n\n290\n00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:40.230\nBut this machine is only\ngoing to see two gigs of it.\n\n291\n00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:41.400\nI'm giving it just a small piece.\n\n292\n00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:44.740\nNow, that might not be enough, I might\nneed to give it more but, in this case,\n\n293\n00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:45.240\nit's enough for me.\n\n294\n00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:46.920\nI can give it a network adaptor.\n\n295\n00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:47.970\nI can give hard drive space.\n\n296\n00:14:47.970 --> 00:14:51.460\nI need to give it the hardware\nthat I want it to have.\n\n297\n00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:54.720\nIf the defaults are okay, which they\nare for me, you can just hit Finish.\n\n298\n00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:57.700\nAnd now it's just gonna ask me\nwhere to save it on the hard drive.\n\n299\n00:14:57.700 --> 00:14:59.680\nI'll just throw it right\nhere in this default folder.\n\n300\n00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:02.450\nAnd there it goes.\n\n301\n00:15:02.450 --> 00:15:04.020\nAnd now it's gonna boot up.\n\n302\n00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:06.930\nHere it's booting up a virtual computer.\n\n303\n00:15:06.930 --> 00:15:08.890\nNot a real computer, not real hardware.\n\n304\n00:15:08.890 --> 00:15:09.850\nFake hardware.\n\n305\n00:15:09.850 --> 00:15:13.550\nFake memory, fake hard drive,\nfake CPU, fake network adapter.\n\n306\n00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:17.210\nAll fake stuff but\nWindows is going to think it's real.\n\n307\n00:15:17.210 --> 00:15:19.810\nAnd so Windows is now booting up and\n\n308\n00:15:19.810 --> 00:15:23.150\nit's going to launch the installer and\nI installed just like I would on\n\n309\n00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:26.270\nreal hardware cuz it has no\nidea that it's different.\n\n310\n00:15:26.270 --> 00:15:27.670\nBut in the meantime this is just a window.\n\n311\n00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:29.140\nI can move it over to the side.\n\n312\n00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:31.340\nAnd now I'm back on my Mac and\n\n313\n00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:34.390\nI can start to do all they Macky\nthings that I like to do, right?\n\n314\n00:15:34.390 --> 00:15:38.722\nSo I can fire up, let's see,\nI guess I don't have pages installed or\n\n315\n00:15:38.722 --> 00:15:43.746\nanything, but I can fire up iTunes or\nwhatever it is that I wanna to run, right?\n\n316\n00:15:43.746 --> 00:15:48.203\nSo here's my Mac applications, meanwhile\nI've got a window right here with my\n\n317\n00:15:48.203 --> 00:15:51.861\nWindows applications and\nI can use installed programs in here and\n\n318\n00:15:51.861 --> 00:15:55.207\nthey'll run just fine cuz it's\nrunning on top of Windows.\n\n319\n00:15:55.207 --> 00:15:56.997\nNow I'm not gonna wait for that to finish,\n\n320\n00:15:56.997 --> 00:15:59.899\nlet me switch over to a machine that\nI've already got up and running.\n\n321\n00:15:59.899 --> 00:16:00.420\nRight here.\n\n322\n00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:04.489\nNow what you guys see is me\njust sliding screens, but\n\n323\n00:16:04.489 --> 00:16:07.520\nthis is actually a separate machine.\n\n324\n00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:09.610\nLet me move it back into a window.\n\n325\n00:16:09.610 --> 00:16:10.570\nHere.\n\n326\n00:16:10.570 --> 00:16:14.020\nI've got Windows 10 running\nin a virtual machine.\n\n327\n00:16:14.020 --> 00:16:17.910\nAnd as far as Windows 10 is concerned,\nit's on, it's own machine.\n\n328\n00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:20.850\nBut in reality it's just running\non this virtual set of hardware.\n\n329\n00:16:20.850 --> 00:16:25.610\nAnd so if I take it and\nmake it full screen again,\n\n330\n00:16:25.610 --> 00:16:28.830\nnow it's the same thing as if I\nwas sitting at a Windows machine.\n\n331\n00:16:28.830 --> 00:16:30.580\nI don't even necessarily\nsee that I'm on a Mac,\n\n332\n00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:33.096\nexcept for\nthe logos that I see on my computer.\n\n333\n00:16:33.096 --> 00:16:36.270\nBut I see Windows, and\n\n334\n00:16:36.270 --> 00:16:41.190\nif I go into the Windows let's go\nto the Device Manager for example.\n\n335\n00:16:43.190 --> 00:16:44.110\nGo into that.\n\n336\n00:16:44.110 --> 00:16:48.310\nIf I go into my Device Manager in Windows\nto look at my hardware, what do I see?\n\n337\n00:16:48.310 --> 00:16:52.650\nWell as I look at it,\nit's gonna see things like a process.\n\n338\n00:16:52.650 --> 00:16:57.300\nAnd when I look at the processor\nit sees Intel Core i7s.\n\n339\n00:16:57.300 --> 00:17:00.130\nThat's what iMac has, right.\n\n340\n00:17:00.130 --> 00:17:02.440\nIt's sharing the CPUs.\n\n341\n00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:06.470\nAnd if I look at things like memory and\nstorage, it sees a hard drive, right.\n\n342\n00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:09.570\nSo if I go to disk drives,\nit sees that I've got a hard drive.\n\n343\n00:17:09.570 --> 00:17:13.710\nBut look at that hard drive,\nVMware Virtual S SCSI Disk Device,\n\n344\n00:17:13.710 --> 00:17:16.770\nit's a fake hard drive but\nWindows thinks it's real.\n\n345\n00:17:16.770 --> 00:17:20.830\nAnd if I look at the network adapters and\nI look at those, it thinks it's got\n\n346\n00:17:20.830 --> 00:17:25.080\nan Intel Gigabit Network Connection but\nit doesn't, that's fake, right.\n\n347\n00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:27.250\nBut it's been faked by\nthe virtualization software,\n\n348\n00:17:27.250 --> 00:17:30.210\nWindows doesn't realized that\nit thinks that it's real.\n\n349\n00:17:30.210 --> 00:17:34.650\nSo when it runs when it does it's work,\n\n350\n00:17:34.650 --> 00:17:37.050\nas far as it's concerned,\nit's on real hardware.\n\n351\n00:17:37.050 --> 00:17:41.500\nIt sees this one I gave 4 gigs of RAM,\nso it sees 4 gigs of RAM, it's up,\n\n352\n00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:44.980\nit's running, it's happy,\nand it's ready to do work.\n\n353\n00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:47.860\n>> Well Don, now that we have\nthe virtualization platform installed,\n\n354\n00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:51.750\nit's running, that's cool, now we can\ninstall all those excellent applications\n\n355\n00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:54.250\nthat we know and\nlove that won't run on Mac.\n\n356\n00:17:54.250 --> 00:17:55.570\nI needed the Windows platform,\n\n357\n00:17:55.570 --> 00:17:58.810\nwe can throw that on there,\nwe can run them two side by side.\n\n358\n00:17:58.810 --> 00:18:02.530\nNow there are some interesting\nthings about that, right.\n\n359\n00:18:02.530 --> 00:18:06.860\nThe way that the two computers can\ninteract or not interact, right.\n\n360\n00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:09.340\n>> Yeah, so the biggest complaint\nyou get about this solution,\n\n361\n00:18:09.340 --> 00:18:13.290\nthis solution works really well, the\nsoftware is gonna run extremely stable.\n\n362\n00:18:13.290 --> 00:18:16.400\nBecause it is actually\nrunning on top of Windows.\n\n363\n00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:19.950\nSo when I install notepad++,\nand I'm accepting the defaults,\n\n364\n00:18:19.950 --> 00:18:21.890\njust cruising right through the installer.\n\n365\n00:18:21.890 --> 00:18:25.700\nAs soon as that's done,\nwhen I launch that software,\n\n366\n00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:27.810\nit's running the way that\nit was intended to run.\n\n367\n00:18:27.810 --> 00:18:32.410\nAnd so if I type a document here's\na document, and I go to save it,\n\n368\n00:18:32.410 --> 00:18:37.380\nwhen I go to save it, Well right here\nI've got my Window shortcuts and\n\n369\n00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:41.360\nI can jump to my desktop or my libraries,\nI can get to my documents folder\n\n370\n00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:45.740\nwhen I drop this down, I see my documents\nfolder right here and I can save to it,\n\n371\n00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:49.890\nit works the way that it was intended cuz\nthis is how the software was designed.\n\n372\n00:18:49.890 --> 00:18:53.050\nI'm not seeing crazy pads,\nI'm seeing my C drive,\n\n373\n00:18:53.050 --> 00:18:55.290\nI'm seeing my folders like I expect.\n\n374\n00:18:55.290 --> 00:19:01.120\nThings are nice and stable, except it\nis a completely separate environment.\n\n375\n00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:05.821\nIf I'm over here on my Mac,\nI'm working and I say, I need no pen++.\n\n376\n00:19:05.821 --> 00:19:09.530\nI'm gonna switch over to Windows,\nand now I gotta do the work here.\n\n377\n00:19:09.530 --> 00:19:12.720\nThe end users sees it,\nit's very visible to the end user.\n\n378\n00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:13.870\n>> And some end users don't like that.\n\n379\n00:19:13.870 --> 00:19:15.630\nAnd they say, you know what,\njust give me a Windows machine, so\n\n380\n00:19:15.630 --> 00:19:16.880\nI don't have to switch at all.\n\n381\n00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:19.110\nNow I can just jump right over there and\ndo it.\n\n382\n00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:22.790\nBut some of the virtualization software,\nnot the free stuff,\n\n383\n00:19:22.790 --> 00:19:23.750\nlike VirtualBox, doesn't do it.\n\n384\n00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:27.250\nBut the pay stuff, like VMware Fusion and\nParallels Desktop,\n\n385\n00:19:27.250 --> 00:19:32.270\nthey have a mode that mixes the two\noperating systems, and it is a lot of fun.\n\n386\n00:19:32.270 --> 00:19:33.480\nI use this all the time.\n\n387\n00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:35.770\nIn VMware Fusion they call it Unity Mode.\n\n388\n00:19:35.770 --> 00:19:41.000\nAnd with unity mode, what they do is\nrun a program in the virtual machine.\n\n389\n00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.550\nBut you see it on your mac.\n\n390\n00:19:44.550 --> 00:19:47.070\nSo for example,\nlet me just kill this machine.\n\n391\n00:19:47.070 --> 00:19:51.990\nSince I don't really need it,\nso I'll shut it down.\n\n392\n00:19:51.990 --> 00:19:53.910\nI have a virtual machine on here.\n\n393\n00:19:53.910 --> 00:19:56.090\nAnd this is the one I really use.\n\n394\n00:19:56.090 --> 00:19:56.770\nRight here.\n\n395\n00:19:56.770 --> 00:19:58.701\nIt's called Don Pezet's Windows VM.\n\n396\n00:19:58.701 --> 00:20:00.280\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n397\n00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:03.660\nso this is a Windows virtual machine that\nruns in the background of my computer.\n\n398\n00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:04.450\nI never see it.\n\n399\n00:20:04.450 --> 00:20:05.740\nSee that little thumbnail.\n\n400\n00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:08.010\nHow it's got like a gray desktop and\nit's really plain.\n\n401\n00:20:08.010 --> 00:20:10.220\nI don't care about that\nbecause I never see it.\n\n402\n00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:12.160\nI never actually look at this machine.\n\n403\n00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:14.140\nBecause it runs n the background.\n\n404\n00:20:14.140 --> 00:20:19.030\nAnd I install Windows programs on it and\nthose Windows programs,\n\n405\n00:20:19.030 --> 00:20:24.990\nif I look up here in my Mac menu bar,\nI've got a VM fusion menu bar item.\n\n406\n00:20:24.990 --> 00:20:29.140\nAnd if I hit that item,\nhere's Don's Windows VM.\n\n407\n00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:31.750\nAnd I see programs,\nI see Microsoft Project,\n\n408\n00:20:31.750 --> 00:20:35.720\nMicrosoft Visio, MarkdownPad,\nthese are all programs.\n\n409\n00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:39.040\nThat don't have a Mac equivalent.\n\n410\n00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:43.060\nSo let's say that one of the viewers\nin the chatroom says, hey Don,\n\n411\n00:20:43.060 --> 00:20:45.820\nI'm viewing the website in\nInternet Explorer, and it's broken.\n\n412\n00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:49.620\nAnd I say, well boy I'd like to\ncheck that but I'm on a Mac.\n\n413\n00:20:49.620 --> 00:20:52.030\nI've got Chrome, I've got Firefox,\nI've got Safari,\n\n414\n00:20:52.030 --> 00:20:55.400\nI don't have Internet Explorer\ncuz it only runs on Windows.\n\n415\n00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:59.540\nWell I have Internet Explorer\nrunning in my Windows VM.\n\n416\n00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:01.770\nAnd I can run that, and when I do.\n\n417\n00:21:03.870 --> 00:21:07.730\nHere it is and I'm now running\nInternet Explorer on my Mac.\n\n418\n00:21:07.730 --> 00:21:11.400\nOkay, now I say I'm running\nInternet Explorer on my Mac.\n\n419\n00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:13.480\nAnd you see the window right here.\n\n420\n00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:18.880\nI'm running it and I'm not I'm\nnot in a virtual machine window.\n\n421\n00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:21.990\nI'm just looking at Internet Explorer.\n\n422\n00:21:21.990 --> 00:21:24.220\nAll right, this is it.\n\n423\n00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:28.070\nIf I pull up my little option here and\nI go to about Internet Explorer.\n\n424\n00:21:28.070 --> 00:21:32.320\nThis is Internet Explorer 11 and\nit's running on my Mac.\n\n425\n00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:35.960\nRight, know having to switch to\na different operating system this is just,\n\n426\n00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:37.500\nright here.\n\n427\n00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:38.990\nAlong with my other system.\n\n428\n00:21:38.990 --> 00:21:43.940\nAnd if I continue to do that, if I drop it\ndown, I launch like my Microsoft project.\n\n429\n00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:45.060\nRight.\nSo there it goes project.\n\n430\n00:21:45.060 --> 00:21:47.060\nI can open up a blank project and\nget to work.\n\n431\n00:21:47.060 --> 00:21:51.830\nAnd I can fire up Vizio and so\nhere it's launching Microsoft Vizio.\n\n432\n00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:55.820\nAnd let me just do like\nbasic network diagram.\n\n433\n00:21:55.820 --> 00:21:57.880\nOkay, so there it goes.\n\n434\n00:21:57.880 --> 00:22:02.410\nAnd I'm running these just like\nany other app on my Mac, and\n\n435\n00:22:02.410 --> 00:22:07.160\neven if I look down here at my doc, they\njust show up as apps that are running.\n\n436\n00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:09.160\nThis is not a separate machine anymore.\n\n437\n00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:10.780\nIt's blent in.\n\n438\n00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:13.700\nIt's a unity view with my Mac.\n\n439\n00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:18.210\nThis removes that user argument of I don't\nwanna have to maintain two environments.\n\n440\n00:22:18.210 --> 00:22:22.030\nI don't wanna have to switch from\nmy Mac to my Windows machine.\n\n441\n00:22:22.030 --> 00:22:24.500\nBut I've got these apps that\nhave to run on Windows.\n\n442\n00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:25.050\nYou can do that.\n\n443\n00:22:25.050 --> 00:22:28.490\nSo my apps are running on Windows,\nbut I don't see that.\n\n444\n00:22:28.490 --> 00:22:33.430\nAs the end user, I just see these\napps that are running right here,\n\n445\n00:22:33.430 --> 00:22:34.930\nalongside my Mac apps.\n\n446\n00:22:34.930 --> 00:22:36.400\nSo I can fire up Safari.\n\n447\n00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:42.240\nAnd so here's my Safari window, and\nI can park that on one side of my screen.\n\n448\n00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:44.890\nAnd then I can take Internet Explorer and\n\n449\n00:22:44.890 --> 00:22:47.190\nI can park that on the other\nside of my screen.\n\n450\n00:22:47.190 --> 00:22:48.890\nAnd now I can go and look at web sites.\n\n451\n00:22:48.890 --> 00:22:52.030\nAnd I can say,\nyou know what let me compare the web site.\n\n452\n00:22:52.030 --> 00:22:53.260\nAnd I can pull it up here.\n\n453\n00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:56.080\nWe'll pull up ITProTV in Safari and\n\n454\n00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:59.720\nthen over here I can pull up\nITProTV in Internet Explorer.\n\n455\n00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:01.170\nAnd I can say, let's compare it and see.\n\n456\n00:23:01.170 --> 00:23:02.400\nIs it broken?\n\n457\n00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:03.180\nI don't know.\n\n458\n00:23:03.180 --> 00:23:04.970\nNo, they are currently working.\n\n459\n00:23:04.970 --> 00:23:05.980\nSo if you're a web developer,\n\n460\n00:23:05.980 --> 00:23:10.495\nthis is really handy because I can't run\nthe true version of Safari on Windows.\n\n461\n00:23:10.495 --> 00:23:13.645\nThey have that lame one that\nhasn't been updated in five years,\n\n462\n00:23:13.645 --> 00:23:14.905\nthat runs on Windows.\n\n463\n00:23:14.905 --> 00:23:18.695\nBut I can run the full version of Safari,\nthe full version of Firefox,\n\n464\n00:23:18.695 --> 00:23:21.375\nthe full version of Chrome, and\nthe full version of Internet Explorer.\n\n465\n00:23:21.375 --> 00:23:23.985\nAll side by side, and make use of those.\n\n466\n00:23:23.985 --> 00:23:26.135\nSo it's really neat stuff, and\n\n467\n00:23:26.135 --> 00:23:29.305\nit removes that argument of,\nI don't want two environments.\n\n468\n00:23:29.305 --> 00:23:30.485\nWell here you just have one environment.\n\n469\n00:23:30.485 --> 00:23:31.470\nYou just run it.\n\n470\n00:23:31.470 --> 00:23:34.080\nAnd these icons,\nthey even show up in your applications, so\n\n471\n00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:38.910\nlike if I browse into my Applications\nfolder and start poking around in here.\n\n472\n00:23:38.910 --> 00:23:41.960\nI might have turned it off,\nlet's see if it's on.\n\n473\n00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:46.654\nNo it is on, so nope, no it's not,\nI don't see Microsoft Visio in there.\n\n474\n00:23:46.654 --> 00:23:50.942\nYou can turn it on as an option where Dell\nactually show up in here and you'll able\n\n475\n00:23:50.942 --> 00:23:55.359\nto see them as regular old applications,\nfrom mine I've got that turned off there\n\n476\n00:23:55.359 --> 00:23:59.667\nin my menu bar up top, this show up in\nthe spotlight too though, if I type Visio.\n\n477\n00:23:59.667 --> 00:24:00.318\nIt'll turn up.\n\n478\n00:24:00.318 --> 00:24:01.385\nNo, I must have that turned off too.\n\n479\n00:24:01.385 --> 00:24:04.749\nA lot of this stuff is customizable, so\nyou can tweak it so they show up here or\n\n480\n00:24:04.749 --> 00:24:07.640\nthey don't show up and\nI must have turned that one off.\n\n481\n00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:11.640\nBut, for me, if I want to launch them\nI just have the little bar right here.\n\n482\n00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:14.420\nI see my start menu from Windows, and\n\n483\n00:24:14.420 --> 00:24:16.890\nI can launch whatever app I want and\nthen I'm in there.\n\n484\n00:24:16.890 --> 00:24:20.710\n>> Don, is this really the answer to\nall our prayers that it seems to be?\n\n485\n00:24:20.710 --> 00:24:24.300\nAre there any caveats like little weird,\nyou know how it always is,\n\n486\n00:24:24.300 --> 00:24:28.490\nthere's always something about it\nthat doesn't work quite the same.\n\n487\n00:24:28.490 --> 00:24:30.140\nIt really looks like it does though.\n\n488\n00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:32.230\n>> Yeah, the challenge here\nis just the learning curve.\n\n489\n00:24:32.230 --> 00:24:35.260\nSo if you go with Parallel's desktop,\nor you go with VMware Fusion,\n\n490\n00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:37.480\nyou've gotta learn how to get\na lot of this stuff set up.\n\n491\n00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:40.910\nThings like, when I save to the hard\ndrive I wanna have one documents folder.\n\n492\n00:24:40.910 --> 00:24:43.389\nI don't wanna have a documents\nfolder in my Windows VM and\n\n493\n00:24:43.389 --> 00:24:44.690\na documents folder in my Mac.\n\n494\n00:24:44.690 --> 00:24:46.725\nAnd so,\nthe software will take care of that.\n\n495\n00:24:46.725 --> 00:24:49.420\nThey will make sure you have\nthat one documents folder.\n\n496\n00:24:49.420 --> 00:24:54.740\nSo, for example, if I switch back\nover to the Vizio for example, right?\n\n497\n00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:56.120\nWe'll do project.\n\n498\n00:24:56.120 --> 00:24:58.920\nSo, if I go on to project and\nI start adding some tasks.\n\n499\n00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:01.560\nAnd so, I'm doing some work and\nI go to save.\n\n500\n00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:03.820\nWhen I save that, where do I save it?\n\n501\n00:25:03.820 --> 00:25:07.580\nWell, notice where how the computer\nis listed it says, VMware-host,\n\n502\n00:25:07.580 --> 00:25:09.590\nshared folders, Dropbox.\n\n503\n00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:12.710\nI've got it tied to my Dropbox, so\nit'll show up on all of my computers.\n\n504\n00:25:12.710 --> 00:25:15.730\nBut I could just choose regular\nold documents here, and\n\n505\n00:25:15.730 --> 00:25:17.290\nsave into My Documents.\n\n506\n00:25:17.290 --> 00:25:20.050\nBut that's saving into my Windows VM.\n\n507\n00:25:20.050 --> 00:25:24.610\nAnd not saving to my Mac, and so I can\nconfigure it where I do have a share set\n\n508\n00:25:24.610 --> 00:25:26.420\nup between those,\nthat's done in the VMWare properties.\n\n509\n00:25:26.420 --> 00:25:29.828\nI just don't have it set up here\nbecause I use my Dropbox instead.\n\n510\n00:25:29.828 --> 00:25:33.458\nSo you do have to take some little extra\nsteps like that, but once it's set up,\n\n511\n00:25:33.458 --> 00:25:37.366\nit is completely seamless, the end-users\ndon't even necessarily have to realize\n\n512\n00:25:37.366 --> 00:25:39.859\nthat they've got this VM\nrunning in the background.\n\n513\n00:25:39.859 --> 00:25:42.810\nThey're just additional apps that\nare running right here on the Mac.\n\n514\n00:25:42.810 --> 00:25:44.130\nIt works really well.\n\n515\n00:25:44.130 --> 00:25:45.110\nAnd what I showed you here,\n\n516\n00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:48.520\nthese were Windows machines\nrunning on top of the Mac.\n\n517\n00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:50.370\nI can run Linux machines, too.\n\n518\n00:25:50.370 --> 00:25:52.420\nIt's not limited to just Windows.\n\n519\n00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:55.090\nA lot of these advanced features,\nthese Unity-type view things,\n\n520\n00:25:55.090 --> 00:25:56.630\nthose might be tied to Windows.\n\n521\n00:25:56.630 --> 00:25:59.510\nBut as far as the operating systems are\nconcerned, you can do whatever you want.\n\n522\n00:25:59.510 --> 00:26:05.250\nIf I fire up VMware Fusion again,\nlet me go back into my lab.\n\n523\n00:26:05.250 --> 00:26:07.120\nAnd let's say I need a Linux machine for\nthis show.\n\n524\n00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:09.020\nSo I can just come in here and\nadd a new Linux machine.\n\n525\n00:26:09.020 --> 00:26:15.150\nAnd when it asks for an image or\na disk I can pick CentOS-7 or\n\n526\n00:26:15.150 --> 00:26:19.030\nDebian, or\nwhatever other Linux distro I want.\n\n527\n00:26:19.030 --> 00:26:22.280\nAnd I can jump in and\nwhip up one of those machines and\n\n528\n00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:23.810\nhave it running in short order.\n\n529\n00:26:23.810 --> 00:26:27.220\nSo once I save that,\nthat's gonna get created.\n\n530\n00:26:27.220 --> 00:26:30.110\nAnd now it's gonna boot up and\nit's gonna start installing Linux.\n\n531\n00:26:30.110 --> 00:26:31.720\nAnd so now I can run Linux on the machine.\n\n532\n00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:34.510\nIf you just wanna learn Linux, but you\ndon't wanna necessarily format your hard\n\n533\n00:26:34.510 --> 00:26:37.520\ndrive, you can do it right here,\ninside of a virtual machine.\n\n534\n00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:41.120\nAnd you're gonna be good to go.\n\n535\n00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:43.820\nOther things you can do,\nyou can virtualize Mac OS.\n\n536\n00:26:43.820 --> 00:26:45.690\nI do that all the,\nI'm doing it here on the show.\n\n537\n00:26:45.690 --> 00:26:48.030\nYou guys have seen where I'll\nhave a server, and a client, and\n\n538\n00:26:48.030 --> 00:26:49.160\nall these different things.\n\n539\n00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:51.750\nI don't have ten Macs laying on\nthe desk here in front of me,\n\n540\n00:26:51.750 --> 00:26:53.170\nthey're mostly virtual machines.\n\n541\n00:26:53.170 --> 00:26:55.280\nThere's some things where I\nhave this Mac Mini right here,\n\n542\n00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:58.450\nbecause I have to have physical hardware,\nbut if it's something like,\n\n543\n00:26:58.450 --> 00:27:04.170\nif you go back and watch the profile of\nmanager episode right, I had a server.\n\n544\n00:27:04.170 --> 00:27:07.560\nAnd I was pushing settings to a client,\nwill both the server and\n\n545\n00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:11.360\nclient, those are just virtual machines\nthat are right here in VMware fusion.\n\n546\n00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:16.100\nThat if you take a look,\nI've got a OS 10 server,\n\n547\n00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:19.190\nan OS 10 client, a Windows server,\nand a Windows client.\n\n548\n00:27:19.190 --> 00:27:22.220\nBecause we're doing Mac integration,\nI gotta integrate this stuff.\n\n549\n00:27:22.220 --> 00:27:26.630\nAnd so, I can fire up that server when\nI want it, and here it goes, it's gonna\n\n550\n00:27:26.630 --> 00:27:30.110\nlaunch, and while that's launching,\nI can fire up this client, whoops.\n\n551\n00:27:30.110 --> 00:27:31.300\nClick on the right thing.\n\n552\n00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:35.230\nI can fire up the client and\nthese are gonna boot up and when I need to\n\n553\n00:27:35.230 --> 00:27:38.110\nshow something that's on the system\nthat has the server app installed,\n\n554\n00:27:38.110 --> 00:27:39.920\nit's ready to go, I've got this machine.\n\n555\n00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:41.340\nAnd then I can just flip over and\n\n556\n00:27:41.340 --> 00:27:44.704\nI've got this other machine that's\nrunning El Capitan with a stock install.\n\n557\n00:27:44.704 --> 00:27:47.740\nAnd I can do my demonstrations and\nat the end of the day\n\n558\n00:27:47.740 --> 00:27:50.800\nI can delete these machines, and\nmy regular desktop is just fine.\n\n559\n00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:54.770\nSo if you're doing the test environments,\nlabs, just practice type things,\n\n560\n00:27:54.770 --> 00:27:58.250\nthese workout really well, and I can\nvirtualize Macs to my heart's content.\n\n561\n00:27:58.250 --> 00:28:01.440\nNow, one question that\nI usually get is well,\n\n562\n00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:05.620\ncan I just keep my Windows machine and\nrun Mac OS in a virtual machine?\n\n563\n00:28:05.620 --> 00:28:07.070\nAnd the answer to that is no.\n\n564\n00:28:07.070 --> 00:28:10.120\nApple doesn't allow that,\nApple's license is very strict.\n\n565\n00:28:10.120 --> 00:28:14.860\nThey say that you can only virtualize\nMac OS if it's running on top of Mac OS.\n\n566\n00:28:14.860 --> 00:28:18.798\nSo when I'm running VMWare Fusion on\nMac OS, I can have Mac virtual machines,\n\n567\n00:28:18.798 --> 00:28:22.813\nthat's exactly what I'm doing here and\nI can have Windows and I can have Linux.\n\n568\n00:28:22.813 --> 00:28:27.097\nBut if I'm running Windows as my base OS,\nI can't have Mac VMs.\n\n569\n00:28:27.097 --> 00:28:30.774\nAnd so if you ever wondered like if you\nwatch my other shows, I do Window shows,\n\n570\n00:28:30.774 --> 00:28:33.692\nI do Cisco and so on and\npeople ask me Don, why do you have a Mac?\n\n571\n00:28:33.692 --> 00:28:35.363\nYou must be an Apple fan boy.\n\n572\n00:28:35.363 --> 00:28:39.493\nWell, the answer is no, actually I'm\npretty agnostic, I don't care like Linux,\n\n573\n00:28:39.493 --> 00:28:42.120\nMac, Windows I don't care,\nI use them all, right?\n\n574\n00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:45.955\nBut I have a Mac just to conform with\nApple's licensing right because I\n\n575\n00:28:45.955 --> 00:28:50.310\nneed to Mac VMs here for the show, and you\ncan only do that on Apple hardware, and\n\n576\n00:28:50.310 --> 00:28:51.750\nso I have an Apple laptop.\n\n577\n00:28:51.750 --> 00:28:55.550\nThat's the main reason I've got it is so\nthat I can do those VMs.\n\n578\n00:28:55.550 --> 00:28:56.760\nOtherwise, you're right.\n\n579\n00:28:56.760 --> 00:28:59.710\nWhat's the difference on the hardware if I\ncan run a virtual machine that's whatever\n\n580\n00:28:59.710 --> 00:29:00.440\nOS I want?\n\n581\n00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:04.330\nI don't really care what the hardware is,\nso licensing is an important thing.\n\n582\n00:29:04.330 --> 00:29:07.250\nBut aside from that\nthey all work the same.\n\n583\n00:29:07.250 --> 00:29:08.820\nSo I'm getting logged into my client and\n\n584\n00:29:08.820 --> 00:29:14.250\nmy server here, and on my client\nhere's my stock install of Yosemite.\n\n585\n00:29:14.250 --> 00:29:16.850\nAnd that's important on a show like this\nbecause I want to show you guys that\n\n586\n00:29:16.850 --> 00:29:19.420\nbase machine that hasn't been modified.\n\n587\n00:29:19.420 --> 00:29:23.730\nVersus me showing you my desktop where\non my desktop, I've installed tons of\n\n588\n00:29:23.730 --> 00:29:28.490\nsoftware, and I've changed my wallpaper,\nand I've messed with my doc, and so\n\n589\n00:29:28.490 --> 00:29:33.595\nyou're not seeing the true default\nsolution versus here you are.\n\n590\n00:29:33.595 --> 00:29:36.965\nSo these are all different ways that we\ncan use virtualization on our Mac, and\n\n591\n00:29:36.965 --> 00:29:40.095\nhelp integrate with\nother operating systems.\n\n592\n00:29:40.095 --> 00:29:42.675\nBe it Windows, be it Linux,\nbe it whatever.\n\n593\n00:29:42.675 --> 00:29:46.785\nRight, and my Linux installer\nthat's sitting right here.\n\n594\n00:29:46.785 --> 00:29:48.745\nAnd there it is,\nasking me what langauge and\n\n595\n00:29:48.745 --> 00:29:50.395\nkind of moving forward with that install.\n\n596\n00:29:50.395 --> 00:29:53.280\nSo virtualization software\nlike this is very valuable.\n\n597\n00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:56.840\nIn the Mac world,\nParallels Desktop and VMware Fusion.\n\n598\n00:29:56.840 --> 00:29:59.250\nThose are the kinda market\nleaders in the environment.\n\n599\n00:29:59.250 --> 00:30:02.100\nI prefer VMware Fusion,\na lot of people prefer Parallels Desktop.\n\n600\n00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:03.940\nThey both are very similar.\n\n601\n00:30:03.940 --> 00:30:06.140\nVirtualBox is good, also,\nbecause it's free, but\n\n602\n00:30:06.140 --> 00:30:07.840\nit's not as feature-rich\nas the other ones.\n\n603\n00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:10.040\nSo those are three products that\nyou'll definitely wanna check out.\n\n604\n00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:11.190\n>> Excellent stuff, Don.\n\n605\n00:30:11.190 --> 00:30:15.520\nThank you so much for stopping by and\nexplaining how we can use virtualization\n\n606\n00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:18.590\nto get that compatibility\nbecause if we're mixing modes,\n\n607\n00:30:18.590 --> 00:30:23.490\nwe got people running a Mac hardware and\nI still need to support those\n\n608\n00:30:23.490 --> 00:30:27.270\nline of business type of applications\nthat only run on a Windows environment.\n\n609\n00:30:27.270 --> 00:30:30.190\nWell this is a great way for\nus to be able to do that.\n\n610\n00:30:30.190 --> 00:30:33.500\nAny other parting words of wisdom for\nour viewers before we wrap it up?\n\n611\n00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:36.060\n>> That's about it,\ndefinitely I would take a look at those.\n\n612\n00:30:36.060 --> 00:30:38.082\nThere is one other thing though,\n\n613\n00:30:38.082 --> 00:30:42.635\nis sometimes you have an application\nthat runs on Windows that also has some\n\n614\n00:30:42.635 --> 00:30:47.551\nspecial hardware requirement that makes\nit not work in a virtual environment and\n\n615\n00:30:47.551 --> 00:30:51.046\nthat solution, or\nthat environment you need Boot Camp.\n\n616\n00:30:51.046 --> 00:30:53.246\nAnd we didn't talk about\nBoot Camp in this episode,\n\n617\n00:30:53.246 --> 00:30:56.247\nstay tuned though cuz we've got a whole\nepisode on Boot Camp coming up.\n\n618\n00:30:56.247 --> 00:31:01.019\nAnd that's where we actually run the\nWindows operating system directly on our\n\n619\n00:31:01.019 --> 00:31:02.340\nApple hardware.\n\n620\n00:31:02.340 --> 00:31:04.130\nAnd there are some situations\nwhere you need that.\n\n621\n00:31:04.130 --> 00:31:06.310\nSo we are going to take a look at it,\nin the next episode.\n\n622\n00:31:06.310 --> 00:31:08.520\n>> Well that's going to be a lot of fun,\nI look forward to that.\n\n623\n00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:09.910\nThanks again for stopping by and\n\n624\n00:31:09.910 --> 00:31:12.120\nexplaining these concepts\nto our good viewers there.\n\n625\n00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:15.340\nHopefully you guys learned a lot out of\nthis, and you can take that knowledge and\n\n626\n00:31:15.340 --> 00:31:16.920\napply it to your environment.\n\n627\n00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:19.040\nThat being said,\nwe're going to go ahead and sign off.\n\n628\n00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:21.470\nFor IT Pro TV, I've been your host,\nDaniel

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.916 --> 00:00:19.432\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\nin today's episode,\n\n4\n00:00:19.432 --> 00:00:22.580\nwe're continuing on with our\nMac Integration Basics series.\n\n5\n00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.749\nJoining us back in the studio again\ntoday to lend his very high expertise on\n\n6\n00:00:26.749 --> 00:00:27.891\nthat topic-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n7\n00:00:27.891 --> 00:00:30.131\n>> It's none other than the man, the myth,\n\n8\n00:00:30.131 --> 00:00:31.860\nthe legend, that is Don Pezet.\n\n9\n00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:32.980\nDon, welcome to the show, sir.\n\n10\n00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:35.840\n>> Thanks for having me back, Daniel,\nand you know, I'm excited to jump into\n\n11\n00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.490\nwhat's probably gonna be the weirdest\nepisode of this entire series because,\n\n12\n00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:43.190\nall this time we've been talking about\nhow we can get our Mac to integrate and\n\n13\n00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.660\nplay nice with other operating systems and\nother devices out there in the network.\n\n14\n00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.175\nIn this episode,\nwe're just gonna say forget it,\n\n15\n00:00:49.175 --> 00:00:50.936\nlet's install Windows on our Mac.\n\n16\n00:00:50.936 --> 00:00:52.978\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Thanks for the great hardware.\n\n17\n00:00:52.978 --> 00:00:54.499\n>> [LAUGH] I know.\n\n18\n00:00:54.499 --> 00:00:56.776\nSo when you buy a Mac,\nobviously, it ships with Mac OS.\n\n19\n00:00:56.776 --> 00:00:57.765\nThat's typically what you're running.\n\n20\n00:00:57.765 --> 00:01:02.015\nThis whole exam thing is based on OS X,\nthat's what we expect to see, but\n\n21\n00:01:02.015 --> 00:01:06.547\nthere are some times where you just need\nWindows, where you have to have it for\n\n22\n00:01:06.547 --> 00:01:10.400\nsome particular reason and\nit might be a very legitimate reason.\n\n23\n00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.210\nYou might have a line of business\napplication that was specifically\n\n24\n00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.150\ndeveloped for your company that only\nruns in Windows and when you run it in\n\n25\n00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:20.750\na virtual environment, it doesn't work and\nso you can't run it on a Mac.\n\n26\n00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.300\nSo does that mean that's it,\nyou can't have a Mac?\n\n27\n00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.690\nWell, no, you can actually keep your Mac.\n\n28\n00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:30.100\nYou can keep running Mac OS, and\nyou can do what's called dual booting.\n\n29\n00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:35.830\nYou can have Mac OS and Windows\nrunning side by side on your hardware.\n\n30\n00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:38.050\nNow I say side by side,\nwe can't run both at the same time.\n\n31\n00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.640\nIf you want both at the same time,\nyou need virtualization.\n\n32\n00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.030\nIn the last episode,\nwe saw how to use VMware Fusion for\n\n33\n00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.270\nthat, then you can run\nboth at the same time.\n\n34\n00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.600\nIt works great.\n\n35\n00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.520\nBut if I need it to run\non actual hardware,\n\n36\n00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.930\nif I need Windows to be the base operating\nsystem and it's seeing the RAM and\n\n37\n00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.950\nthe CPU and the hard drive and\nall that directly, well I got two choices.\n\n38\n00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.490\nChoice number one, I could just format\nthe hard drive, wipe out Mac OS entirely,\n\n39\n00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.500\njust load Windows on the machine and\noff I go.\n\n40\n00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.440\nNow I've got a Windows PC that\njust happens to have an Apple\n\n41\n00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.610\nlogo stuck on the case, and\nI probably paid too much for it.\n\n42\n00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.103\nSo, that's option one, right?\n\n43\n00:02:16.103 --> 00:02:21.844\nOption two though is, hey, I might need\nWindows, but not necessarily all the time,\n\n44\n00:02:21.844 --> 00:02:26.468\nso what if we have them both installed and\nwhen I turn the computer on,\n\n45\n00:02:26.468 --> 00:02:30.134\nwhen I push that power button,\nhow about I get to pick,\n\n46\n00:02:30.134 --> 00:02:34.178\ndo I wanna boot into Windows,\nor do I wanna boot into Mac OS?\n\n47\n00:02:34.178 --> 00:02:38.150\nAnd if I boot into Mac OS, then OS X comes\nup and I get my desktop and everything\n\n48\n00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.580\nworks like normal, and then I reboot and\nthis time when I boot, I pick Windows.\n\n49\n00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.990\nAnd now we boot into Microsoft Windows and\nit's running natively on the hardware and\n\n50\n00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:49.230\nI've got all all of the system\naccess that we need, all right?\n\n51\n00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.935\nNow from a business standpoint, there's\nactually not a whole lot of need for\n\n52\n00:02:52.935 --> 00:02:53.680\nthis, right?\n\n53\n00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.610\nFrom a business standpoint, usually a line\nof business application will run just fine\n\n54\n00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:02.160\nin a virtual machine, unless it's\nexpecting some kind of physical\n\n55\n00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.720\nhardware that you can't\nhave in a virtual machine.\n\n56\n00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.980\nSo sometimes there's USB devices for\nexample,\n\n57\n00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.280\nthat can't connect into a virtual machine\nor even physical ports in some scenarios.\n\n58\n00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.690\nThere might be PCI boards.\n\n59\n00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:17.375\nYou see this on servers all the time where\nyou need like SSL Accelerator boards or\n\n60\n00:03:17.375 --> 00:03:20.570\nmodem cards or whatever that you\ncan't attach to a virtual machine.\n\n61\n00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:23.101\nThey need to be on a physical machine but\nin this show,\n\n62\n00:03:23.101 --> 00:03:25.030\nwe're really talking about desktops.\n\n63\n00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.821\nAnd on the desktop side, there's really\nonly one scenario I can think of where\n\n64\n00:03:28.821 --> 00:03:31.625\nthis really comes in handy and\nthat's video games.\n\n65\n00:03:31.625 --> 00:03:33.000\nAnd if you're a big video gamer,\n\n66\n00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.410\nwell you can get Macs with\ngreat video cards in them.\n\n67\n00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:41.090\nAt home I've got an iMac, and in my iMac,\nit's got an NVIDIA GTX 980 video card,\n\n68\n00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:47.190\nwhich is a great video card, but\nif I boot into Mac OS, there's not\n\n69\n00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:51.570\na whole lot of video games, and the ones\nthat are there are not very well tuned for\n\n70\n00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:55.410\nrunning under Mac, or running under OS X,\nso they run pretty crummy.\n\n71\n00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:59.270\nBut if I shut my computer down and\nI boot up into Windows,\n\n72\n00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:03.260\nall of a sudden they run miraculously\ngreat and things run off just fine.\n\n73\n00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:04.150\nWhy is that?\n\n74\n00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.540\nWell if you're a developer,\nif you're creating a game or\n\n75\n00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.170\na software application or\nwhatever, you develop for\n\n76\n00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:13.540\nthe platform that's gonna give\nyou the biggest install base.\n\n77\n00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:18.013\nAnd right now in the business world,\nMicrosoft has\n\n78\n00:04:18.013 --> 00:04:22.620\nan 85% share of the desktop space\nout there in the real world.\n\n79\n00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:26.550\nThat's a huge share, so developers will\nusually develop for Windows first.\n\n80\n00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:29.360\nIt's even worse in video gaming,\nwhere video games,\n\n81\n00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.570\nWindows is 95% of the computer systems\nout there for people playing games and\n\n82\n00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:37.490\nit's just a huge dominated\nmarket there for Windows.\n\n83\n00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:40.810\nSo if you wanna run these applications\nto get the best experience,\n\n84\n00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:42.160\nsometimes there's no substitute for\n\n85\n00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:46.650\njust booting up into Windows and\nfortunately, Apple makes that easy for us.\n\n86\n00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:49.450\nWe don't have to format OS X,\nwe don't have to get rid of it and\n\n87\n00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:52.290\nlose it entirely,\nyou can just have it, and\n\n88\n00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:54.740\nhave Windows sitting there on\nthe sideline when you need it.\n\n89\n00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:56.732\nAnd that's exactly what\nI do on my iMac at home,\n\n90\n00:04:56.732 --> 00:05:00.710\nthat it's booted into\nOS X almost all the time.\n\n91\n00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:02.520\nRight now, at this very moment,\nit's booted into OS X.\n\n92\n00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:06.950\nAnd then, I'll go home, I'll work on my\nshow notes, I'll do other things, all\n\n93\n00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:12.490\nunder Mac OS, and then if I feel the need\nto go shoot some aliens in the face or\n\n94\n00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:15.750\nfly a spaceship or whatever, then I'll\nreboot into Windows and I can do that.\n\n95\n00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:18.400\nAnd then when I'm done,\nI just reboot right back into Mac OS.\n\n96\n00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.930\nSo I can now flip between the two.\n\n97\n00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:22.010\nIt's not virtualization.\n\n98\n00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:26.730\nI'm not running VMware Fusion or\nParallels Desktop or anything like that.\n\n99\n00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:29.960\nI'm running Apple's Boot Camp technology.\n\n100\n00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:34.190\nAnd Boot Camp lets you pick between the\ndifferent operating systems when you boot\n\n101\n00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:37.910\nup, so that you can run both on\nthe same set of hardware, all right?\n\n102\n00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:39.820\nNow for most users, this isn't for you.\n\n103\n00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:41.190\nThis isn't something you're gonna need.\n\n104\n00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:44.134\nBut if you fall into one of those\nuser-case scenarios, and I use video games\n\n105\n00:05:44.134 --> 00:05:47.124\ncuz that's probably the most common\nexample, but you may actually have some\n\n106\n00:05:47.124 --> 00:05:50.543\nkind of business application that needs\nthis, well, here's your option right here.\n\n107\n00:05:50.543 --> 00:05:53.295\nAnd from a business standpoint,\nI'll give you a great example.\n\n108\n00:05:53.295 --> 00:05:57.086\nThere's a lot of business software out\nthere that runs on Windows that you could\n\n109\n00:05:57.086 --> 00:06:00.820\nrun in a virtual environment, but they\nhave it in their support agreement that\n\n110\n00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:03.270\nthey will not support it\nin a virtual environment.\n\n111\n00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:05.403\nThey say it's gotta run\nan actual hardware.\n\n112\n00:06:05.403 --> 00:06:08.780\nAnd [COUGH] the reason they're doing that,\nis that if you have a problem and\n\n113\n00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:11.690\nyou call tech support,\nthey don't wanna have to figure out well,\n\n114\n00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:14.160\nis the problem with the software or\nis the problem with virtualization?\n\n115\n00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.140\nSo they just tell you, no,\nwe don't support it on virtualization.\n\n116\n00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:17.800\nYou have to run it on actual hardware.\n\n117\n00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:20.860\nAnd so you'd call and you say well, I'm on\na Mac but I'm running it in VMware Fusion.\n\n118\n00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:24.100\nAnd they say oops, can't help you,\nthanks, call back later and hang up or\n\n119\n00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:24.898\ndon't call back later.\n\n120\n00:06:24.898 --> 00:06:25.880\n[LAUGH] Hang up.\n\n121\n00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:27.040\nSo you get that,\n\n122\n00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:30.610\nand you need to run them on actual\nhardware just to be able to get support.\n\n123\n00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:33.420\nSo leveraging Boot Camp lets us do that.\n\n124\n00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:37.780\nAnd if you have Boot Camp and something\nlike VMware Fusion, VMware Fusion does\n\n125\n00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:41.800\nthis cool thing where it will let you boot\nup your Boot Camp install as a virtual\n\n126\n00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:44.480\nmachine so you can have it both ways and\nthat really works out well too.\n\n127\n00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:46.810\nSo there's kind of some neat\ntechnologies out there.\n\n128\n00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:50.140\nBut let's take a look at what's actually\ninvolved in getting this set up.\n\n129\n00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:54.490\nNow when you buy a Mac, it's gonna have\nMac OS on it and that's it, right?\n\n130\n00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:58.195\nAnd so I've got a Mac mini sitting\nright here on the desk with me, and\n\n131\n00:06:58.195 --> 00:07:01.760\nit's running El Capitan,\nit's just a base install on it.\n\n132\n00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:06.016\nI think I installed, this is one, if you\nwatched our Mac Management Basics show,\n\n133\n00:07:06.016 --> 00:07:08.065\nwe deployed this Mac mini on that show.\n\n134\n00:07:08.065 --> 00:07:12.503\nSo it's got Google Chrome and CyberDoc\ninstalled on it, but otherwise it's\n\n135\n00:07:12.503 --> 00:07:17.298\na pretty base install, but it's just\nrunning Mac OS, and that's it, all right?\n\n136\n00:07:17.298 --> 00:07:18.624\nLet's take a look at the hardrive in this\n\n137\n00:07:18.624 --> 00:07:20.270\nmachine to get an idea of\nwhat I'm talking about.\n\n138\n00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:24.920\nSo here's the Mac mini that I'm on,\nand if I fire up\n\n139\n00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:29.740\nmy disk utility, and\ntake a look at the hard drive, this one's\n\n140\n00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:33.910\ngot a one terabyte hard drive in it\nwhich we'll find here in just a moment.\n\n141\n00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:34.620\nThere we go.\n\n142\n00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:39.362\nSo I can see I've got a one terabyte\nhard drive on it, and it's mostly empty.\n\n143\n00:07:39.362 --> 00:07:40.931\nI don't have anything crazy on here.\n\n144\n00:07:40.931 --> 00:07:45.241\nSo what we're gonna do is we're\ngonna install Windows on here, but\n\n145\n00:07:45.241 --> 00:07:49.700\nmy problem that I'm gonna have is\nthat the hard drive is one terabyte,\n\n146\n00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:53.856\nit's got a ton of space, but\nit's formatted as OS X, or OS 10,\n\n147\n00:07:53.856 --> 00:07:58.883\nExtended Journaled and that is a great\nfile system, if you're running a Mac.\n\n148\n00:07:58.883 --> 00:08:01.745\nBut if you're booting to Windows,\nWindows doesn't know that file system.\n\n149\n00:08:01.745 --> 00:08:02.977\nDoesn't make any sense to it.\n\n150\n00:08:02.977 --> 00:08:04.860\nAnd so Windows can't read this hard drive.\n\n151\n00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:06.900\nThis hard drive is unusable to Windows.\n\n152\n00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:09.210\nSo, what I'm gonna have\nto do is a few things.\n\n153\n00:08:09.210 --> 00:08:11.250\nI'm gonna have to create\na Windows Installer.\n\n154\n00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:15.870\nI'm gonna have to create a spot on the\nhard drive where Windows can run with its\n\n155\n00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:17.580\nown file system.\n\n156\n00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:20.540\nAnd once all that's done,\nI'm gonna have to install Windows.\n\n157\n00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:24.941\nNow, when you install Mac OS, Apple makes\nthe hardware that you're running on.\n\n158\n00:08:24.941 --> 00:08:28.080\nAnd so Mac OS includes all the drivers for\nyour hardware,\n\n159\n00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:31.010\nwe never have to worry about drivers\nwhen we're dealing with Macs,\n\n160\n00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:33.930\nwell with the hardware that\nit comes with at least.\n\n161\n00:08:33.930 --> 00:08:37.403\nBut on a Windows machine, Microsoft\ndoesn't know what hardware you're\n\n162\n00:08:37.403 --> 00:08:41.043\ngonna have, and so they don't have all\nthe drivers that are built into it, so\n\n163\n00:08:41.043 --> 00:08:43.976\nwhen we install Windows it's\ngonna be missing some drivers.\n\n164\n00:08:43.976 --> 00:08:47.661\nAnd that's the last thing that we have\nto do, is we have to give Windows\n\n165\n00:08:47.661 --> 00:08:51.594\nthe additional files that it needs to\nsupport the sound card, and the video\n\n166\n00:08:51.594 --> 00:08:55.730\ncard, and the Bluetooth connectivity,\nthe network adapter and all of that.\n\n167\n00:08:55.730 --> 00:08:58.799\nSo there's a lot of pieces of this\npuzzle that if we go together to create\n\n168\n00:08:58.799 --> 00:09:00.400\na bootcamp install.\n\n169\n00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:01.460\nAt the end of the day, it's not so\n\n170\n00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:04.360\nbad though you'll see we've got a wizard\nthat guides us through most of this and\n\n171\n00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:06.870\nwe just have to get a few\npieces in the puzzle together.\n\n172\n00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:09.060\n>> Now, Don,\nbefore we get started into this endeavor,\n\n173\n00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:12.510\nis there any kind of precautions\nthat we need to take?\n\n174\n00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:16.030\nObviously, we've got a machine that's\nworking, cost us a little bit of money,\n\n175\n00:09:16.030 --> 00:09:20.950\nand we're starting to mess with operating\nsystems and files and hard drives.\n\n176\n00:09:20.950 --> 00:09:24.710\nSo, is there anything we need\nto do before we start into this?\n\n177\n00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:28.740\nSo, step number one,\nback up your system, right.\n\n178\n00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:30.110\nWhen you're messing with the hard drive,\n\n179\n00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:32.970\nthere's always a chance that you could\naccidentally erase the hard drive and\n\n180\n00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:35.955\nif you've got data on there that's\nimportant, well you don't anymore.\n\n181\n00:09:35.955 --> 00:09:37.860\n[LAUGH] So that would be bad.\n\n182\n00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:41.190\nNow I'll tell you guys I've worked\nwith boot camp a ton of times and\n\n183\n00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:43.330\nI've never once lost data.\n\n184\n00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:45.180\nBut it's definitely possible right?\n\n185\n00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:47.380\nBecause we gotta take this\nbig terabyte hard drive and\n\n186\n00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:51.880\nshrink it down to make room for Windows\nno we got to stick Windows on there and\n\n187\n00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:54.260\nthere is a moment,\nI'll show you when we're setting it up.\n\n188\n00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.824\nThere's a moment where if\nyou made a wrong choice,\n\n189\n00:09:56.824 --> 00:10:00.166\nyou could erase the hard drive that\ncontains all of your Mac data and\n\n190\n00:10:00.166 --> 00:10:03.940\nI haven't made that wrong choice yet\nbut who knows one day it might happen.\n\n191\n00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:06.710\nI'm in a hurry,\nI've taken too much cold medicine, and\n\n192\n00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:10.248\nI clicked on a wrong drive [LAUGH] and\nall of a sudden, I format my machine.\n\n193\n00:10:10.248 --> 00:10:12.951\nI'm like, no,\nI've got Windows, it can boot.\n\n194\n00:10:12.951 --> 00:10:17.180\nAt least I've got that are in junk,\nbut I can't [LAUGH] my day anymore.\n\n195\n00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:20.590\nAnd it's terribly difficult to recover,\nhopefully you got your time machine right?\n\n196\n00:10:20.590 --> 00:10:23.220\nTake a backup,\neither a Time Machine backup or\n\n197\n00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:26.120\nat least copy your files off somewhere\nelse but back up your system before you\n\n198\n00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:29.330\nstart to mess with this just\nin case something goes wrong.\n\n199\n00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:33.555\nThe other thing to throw out is\nif you're going to enable this,\n\n200\n00:10:33.555 --> 00:10:38.350\nFileVault can cause some weird stuff\nsometimes when you enable it, and\n\n201\n00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:42.230\nso if you start seeing problems with Boot\nCamp getting turned on, you might need to\n\n202\n00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:47.200\nturn FileVault off, put Boot Camp in place\nand then you can turn FileVault back on.\n\n203\n00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:50.310\nAnd remember FileVault,\nthat's the disc encryption in Mac OS, and\n\n204\n00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:53.480\na lot of times in runs just fine,\ndoesn't cause any problems, but\n\n205\n00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:57.010\nI've had a few times where doing\nBoot Camp caused some problems and\n\n206\n00:10:57.010 --> 00:10:58.990\nturning off FileVault is\nwhat got me past that.\n\n207\n00:10:58.990 --> 00:11:02.440\nOnce you're done you just turn it back on\nagain, it will encrypt the Mac partition,\n\n208\n00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:05.370\nFileVault will not encrypt\nthe Windows partition, so\n\n209\n00:11:05.370 --> 00:11:07.290\nyour Windows data's not protected.\n\n210\n00:11:07.290 --> 00:11:09.590\nIt's up to Windows to protect that data.\n\n211\n00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:11.250\nApple's gonna protect theirs.\n\n212\n00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:14.730\nSo those are a few things that we need to\nbe aware of before we dive into this and\n\n213\n00:11:14.730 --> 00:11:16.650\nstart getting it set-up.\n\n214\n00:11:16.650 --> 00:11:20.610\nThe other thing is, I mentioned that\nwe had to have drivers for Windows.\n\n215\n00:11:20.610 --> 00:11:22.380\nIt had to have drivers to be\nable to support the hardware.\n\n216\n00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:24.160\nWhere do those drivers come from?\n\n217\n00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:26.120\nWell, they come from Apple.\n\n218\n00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:30.830\nAnd Apple sends them to you through the\nsoftware update services inside of Mac OS.\n\n219\n00:11:30.830 --> 00:11:33.420\nSo before you get started with Boot Camp,\nthis is gonna sound weird, but\n\n220\n00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:36.710\nbefore you get started with Boot Camp,\nyou need to update MacOS.\n\n221\n00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:40.300\nI know we're about to install Windows but\nupdating Mac OS will ensure that we have\n\n222\n00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:43.320\nthe latest version of the drivers\nto hand over to our Windows system.\n\n223\n00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:46.910\nSo make sure you run any software\nupdates that are available beforehand.\n\n224\n00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:48.000\nTake a backup.\n\n225\n00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.310\nRun your software updates.\n\n226\n00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:53.230\nSo let's go ahead and get started with\ngetting this set up and step one.\n\n227\n00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:55.580\nWell, I guess I kinda missed some\nrequirements there, didn't I?\n\n228\n00:11:55.580 --> 00:11:56.470\nI was thinking software.\n\n229\n00:11:56.470 --> 00:11:58.490\nSo on the software side,\nwe need to take a backup.\n\n230\n00:11:58.490 --> 00:12:01.490\nWe need to make sure\nwe do all our updates.\n\n231\n00:12:01.490 --> 00:12:04.760\nOn a hardware side, there's another\nthing I forgot to mention which is in\n\n232\n00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:09.720\norder to set up Boot Camp, you have to\nhave some kind of removable storage right?\n\n233\n00:12:10.830 --> 00:12:13.410\nI got this USB hard drive\nthat I'm gonna use.\n\n234\n00:12:13.410 --> 00:12:16.190\nI could also use something\nlike a memory stick but\n\n235\n00:12:16.190 --> 00:12:18.930\nyou gotta have some kind of removable\nstorage and what made me remember that,\n\n236\n00:12:18.930 --> 00:12:22.080\nis the other thing that we're gonna\nneed which is we need a copy a Windows.\n\n237\n00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:25.548\nSo, I've got a copy of Windows on this\nremovable storage I'm just gonna plug this\n\n238\n00:12:25.548 --> 00:12:26.214\nin real quick.\n\n239\n00:12:26.214 --> 00:12:29.660\nWhich is, why is this harder than,\nI'm just going to plug it in, that's all.\n\n240\n00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:30.770\n>> It's USB man.\n\n241\n00:12:30.770 --> 00:12:34.000\n>> So, I'm gonna plug this thing\ninto the ultra convenient USB port.\n\n242\n00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:39.450\nAnd on this removable media, I've\nactually got a copy of a Windows 10 iso,\n\n243\n00:12:39.450 --> 00:12:42.480\nan image of the CD, all right?\n\n244\n00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:47.180\nNow, in order to install this, you are\ngoing to need, that was seriously zoomed.\n\n245\n00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:50.030\nYou are going to need an iso\nfile of the Windows installer.\n\n246\n00:12:50.030 --> 00:12:52.030\nIf you don't have one,\njust go to Microsoft's website.\n\n247\n00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:53.660\nYou'll have to search through\nthere site a little bit but\n\n248\n00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:55.130\nthey have it to where you can download it.\n\n249\n00:12:55.130 --> 00:12:59.880\nApple officially supports Windows 7,\nWindows 8 and Windows 10, all right?\n\n250\n00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:01.100\nThey don't support Vista and earlier.\n\n251\n00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:04.680\nAnd actually, they've been talking about\ndropping the Windows 7 support, so\n\n252\n00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:07.480\nby the time you watch this video,\nWindows 7 support might be gone.\n\n253\n00:13:08.590 --> 00:13:10.430\nIf you're gonna do it though,\nyou might as well go Windows 10.\n\n254\n00:13:10.430 --> 00:13:13.050\nApple has full support for\nWindows 10 on Boot Camp.\n\n255\n00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:17.123\nSo, I'm gonna take that iso image and\nI'm just gonna copy it to my desktop.\n\n256\n00:13:17.123 --> 00:13:17.945\nSo, I've got it right here.\n\n257\n00:13:17.945 --> 00:13:22.415\nNow the reason I'm copying it to my\ndesktop is that whatever removable media I\n\n258\n00:13:22.415 --> 00:13:24.820\nuse, is going to get formatted.\n\n259\n00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:30.880\nIt's got to format it because again, my\nremoval media is OS 10 journaled, right?\n\n260\n00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:32.400\nWindows can't read that.\n\n261\n00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:36.920\nI need a USB key or USB hard drive that I\ncan boot off of that Windows can read so,\n\n262\n00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:40.230\nwe're gonna think it's gonna\ndrive format it and ready for it.\n\n263\n00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:41.990\nI guess I'm not necessarily\nhave to use that disk,\n\n264\n00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:45.480\nI could use my handy dandy palm drive\ninstead so, let me plug this one in.\n\n265\n00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:48.540\nAgain, if you watched our\nMac Management Basics series,\n\n266\n00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:51.600\nthis thumb drive is one that I\nused in our net install episode.\n\n267\n00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:53.430\nSo it's got a net install image on it.\n\n268\n00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:54.920\nOr actually it's a net restore image,\nisn't it?\n\n269\n00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:59.900\nSo I've got my Lab Mac Mini Restore\nthat we used in that one.\n\n270\n00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:03.450\nSo it's got a net boot installer on it and\nall that good stuff.\n\n271\n00:14:03.450 --> 00:14:04.860\nAs you can see it right there.\n\n272\n00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:08.390\nBut it is OS 10 journaled, so\nthat one's gonna get formatted.\n\n273\n00:14:08.390 --> 00:14:13.620\nAnd let me just bring up the disk\nutility again so we can see that.\n\n274\n00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:19.250\nIn my disk utility, here's that\nPatriot Memory, that's my little USB key.\n\n275\n00:14:19.250 --> 00:14:24.090\nAnd if I take a look at it here,\nit shows as being OS X Extended, right?\n\n276\n00:14:24.090 --> 00:14:25.840\nSo it's that extended journal.\n\n277\n00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:28.740\nMy thumb drive is 16 gigs in size.\n\n278\n00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:32.380\nYou're going to need one that's\nat least 8 gigs in size,\n\n279\n00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:36.400\nbecause the Windows installer disk\nis actually a little over four gigs,\n\n280\n00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:41.690\nand the drivers from Apple are close to\n1 gig in size or about 800 megs in size.\n\n281\n00:14:41.690 --> 00:14:44.526\nSo, combined, it's more than a 4\ngig memory stick it handles,\n\n282\n00:14:44.526 --> 00:14:47.990\nwe're gonna need an 8 gig or\na larger memory stick, right.\n\n283\n00:14:47.990 --> 00:14:52.120\nSo, I've got my Windows ISO\nimage right here, and\n\n284\n00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:56.280\nI've got my thumb drive that I'm gonna\nbe wiping to use to make this installer.\n\n285\n00:14:57.580 --> 00:14:59.355\nI'll pretend and say I did a backup.\n\n286\n00:14:59.355 --> 00:15:01.330\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I didn't do a backup.\n\n287\n00:15:01.330 --> 00:15:02.930\nSo we'll say I did a backup.\n\n288\n00:15:02.930 --> 00:15:04.830\nAnd, what about updates?\n\n289\n00:15:04.830 --> 00:15:06.710\nWell, I'm pretty sure\nI did my updates too.\n\n290\n00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:12.200\nBut we can fire up the App Store and\ncheck for updates real quick.\n\n291\n00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:15.120\nI likely don't have any but\nwe can always check.\n\n292\n00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:17.020\nAw, shoot, I've got updates,\nI'm a big liar.\n\n293\n00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:18.700\nSo I was hoping we didn't have updates.\n\n294\n00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:19.890\nAnd yeah, there's a software update.\n\n295\n00:15:19.890 --> 00:15:22.630\nWell, digital camera RAW compatibility.\n\n296\n00:15:22.630 --> 00:15:25.700\nI'm probably okay without updating\nmy digital camera on this one.\n\n297\n00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:27.020\n>> You might make it through, Don.\n\n298\n00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:28.370\n>> So we'll see.\n\n299\n00:15:28.370 --> 00:15:30.330\nSo now I'm ready for Boot Camp.\n\n300\n00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:32.070\nUnfortunately, we've got\na neat little wizard,\n\n301\n00:15:32.070 --> 00:15:34.630\nwe can run this called\nthe Boot Camp assistant.\n\n302\n00:15:34.630 --> 00:15:38.291\nSo, I'm just gonna fire up my spotlight\nand I'll type in boo tcamp but,\n\n303\n00:15:38.291 --> 00:15:40.526\neventually I'll see boot camp assistant.\n\n304\n00:15:40.526 --> 00:15:42.144\n>> This should change\nthat to camp counselor.\n\n305\n00:15:42.144 --> 00:15:44.522\n[LAUGH] That'd be awesome.\n\n306\n00:15:44.522 --> 00:15:46.205\n>> So, I'm gonna fire this up.\n\n307\n00:15:46.205 --> 00:15:48.619\nHere I am.\nIt's got the boot camp help that explains\n\n308\n00:15:48.619 --> 00:15:49.670\nthis whole process and\n\n309\n00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:52.834\ntells you all the different things\nthat we're about to go through.\n\n310\n00:15:52.834 --> 00:15:54.540\nBut it gives you a nice\nlittle summary right here.\n\n311\n00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:57.991\nAnd, All right, well, actually,\nI clicked on it, I guess.\n\n312\n00:15:57.991 --> 00:16:01.598\nSo here, it's just telling me, giving\nme those steps that I can use a USB,\n\n313\n00:16:01.598 --> 00:16:04.750\nhard drive or a flash drive and\nI can run through that installer and\n\n314\n00:16:04.750 --> 00:16:06.890\nit's got all the different steps and\nso on.\n\n315\n00:16:06.890 --> 00:16:10.210\nBut I kind of already know them so\nwe'll skip past that.\n\n316\n00:16:10.210 --> 00:16:11.560\nAll right, so in the Boot Camp Assistant,\n\n317\n00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:13.830\nmostly we're just gonna be clicking\nNext a bunch of times, right?\n\n318\n00:16:13.830 --> 00:16:16.930\nSo I'm gonna hit the Continue\nbutton down here.\n\n319\n00:16:16.930 --> 00:16:18.670\nAnd it's gonna ask me for\n\n320\n00:16:18.670 --> 00:16:21.120\nthe things that I kind of already\ntold you that we needed, right.\n\n321\n00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:24.720\nSo first off, it's gonna say do\nwe want to create a Windows 7 or\n\n322\n00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:26.860\nlater version install disk.\n\n323\n00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:31.020\nI've got to create removable media that\nwill let me install Windows 7 or later.\n\n324\n00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:33.000\nSo we support Windows 7,\nWindows 8, Windows 10.\n\n325\n00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.590\nBut like I said, Apple's already\ntalking about dropping Windows 7 so\n\n326\n00:16:36.590 --> 00:16:39.600\ndon't be surprised that that's\ngone by the time you get to this.\n\n327\n00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:42.300\nThe next one I can't turn off, right.\n\n328\n00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:43.770\nThe first one I can turn off.\n\n329\n00:16:43.770 --> 00:16:47.317\nMaybe I've already made a bootcamp\ninstaller on another computer.\n\n330\n00:16:47.317 --> 00:16:49.595\nI don't have to make a new one,\nI can reuse it over and over and\n\n331\n00:16:49.595 --> 00:16:50.417\nover again if I want.\n\n332\n00:16:50.417 --> 00:16:51.810\nSo, I can turn that off.\n\n333\n00:16:51.810 --> 00:16:55.640\nBut the second one is automatically\nturned on if I check the first one, and\n\n334\n00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:59.510\nwhat this one says is, download the latest\nWindows support software from Apple.\n\n335\n00:16:59.510 --> 00:17:03.500\nIn other words, get the latest Windows\ndrivers from Apple and we want that.\n\n336\n00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:05.760\nWe want the latest and greatest so\nthat's why it's checked.\n\n337\n00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:08.050\nAnd then lastly,\ninstall Windows 7 or later.\n\n338\n00:17:08.050 --> 00:17:09.170\nNow I'm gonna do Windows 10.\n\n339\n00:17:09.170 --> 00:17:11.870\nSo we're gonna blow past 7 and\n8 and go straight to it but\n\n340\n00:17:11.870 --> 00:17:13.970\nthis is gonna let me install it.\n\n341\n00:17:13.970 --> 00:17:16.309\nAll right, so we'll go ahead and\nhit Continue on that and\n\n342\n00:17:16.309 --> 00:17:18.880\nnow it's gonna say all right,\nwhere is the ISO image.\n\n343\n00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:23.390\nWhere can I find that image of Windows\n10 and actually it already found mine.\n\n344\n00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:25.370\nIt apparently just jumped right\nto the desktop and got it.\n\n345\n00:17:25.370 --> 00:17:28.480\nBut if it doesn't for you, you can\nalways just hit Choose and Browse and\n\n346\n00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:33.460\nhunt it down and find that ISO image for\nyou and get it in there.\n\n347\n00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:35.130\nAnd now it's asking\nwhich disk I wanna use.\n\n348\n00:17:35.130 --> 00:17:40.280\nNow I've got this ASMT 2115 Media,\nthat's my external SSD sitting here.\n\n349\n00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:42.520\nI could use that,\nthat would probably be the fastest, but\n\n350\n00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:45.710\nI also have this Patriot Memory,\nthat's a little USB key I popped in, and\n\n351\n00:17:45.710 --> 00:17:50.190\nI wanna use that one because it was\nformatted as OSX Extended Journaled.\n\n352\n00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:51.880\nWe saw that.\nIt's gonna get reformatted, and\n\n353\n00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:54.360\nyou'll see that in a minute, and\nthat's what it's telling me here.\n\n354\n00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:58.130\nThe data in this selected drive\nwill be lost after it is formatted.\n\n355\n00:17:58.130 --> 00:17:59.700\nSo it doesn't matter\nthat it's formatted for\n\n356\n00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:02.150\nMac right now, it's gonna be formatted for\nWindows when we're done.\n\n357\n00:18:02.150 --> 00:18:05.200\nAll right, so I'm gonna go ahead and\nhit Continue on that.\n\n358\n00:18:06.710 --> 00:18:08.860\nAnd now,\nit's just warning me one more time,\n\n359\n00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:13.220\nhey, Don, we're serious, this is where\nyou're gonna lose your data, and I'm okay.\n\n360\n00:18:13.220 --> 00:18:16.815\nSo, it's gonna format the drive and\nit's gonna erase it, then,\n\n361\n00:18:16.815 --> 00:18:21.118\nit's gonna take the Windows 10 ISO image\nand it's gonna break it open, it's\n\n362\n00:18:21.118 --> 00:18:25.383\ngonna open that file up and grab data from\ninside of it and copy it to the USB key.\n\n363\n00:18:25.383 --> 00:18:29.022\nSo, it's gonna move the Windows\ninstallation over to that key, and\n\n364\n00:18:29.022 --> 00:18:31.156\nonce that's done it's then gonna go and\n\n365\n00:18:31.156 --> 00:18:35.697\ndownload the Windows driver software from\nApple, it's about 800 megs in sizes.\n\n366\n00:18:35.697 --> 00:18:39.270\nIt's gonna download that and\nput that on the USB key also.\n\n367\n00:18:39.270 --> 00:18:44.290\nSo the USB key will be bootable, and\nwhen it boots it'll install Windows 10 and\n\n368\n00:18:44.290 --> 00:18:47.305\nwhen it installs Windows 10 it'll\ninstall the Apple drivers also.\n\n369\n00:18:47.305 --> 00:18:49.950\nIt's got everything we need.\n\n370\n00:18:49.950 --> 00:18:51.280\nWe're almost done.\n\n371\n00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:52.060\nI say almost.\n\n372\n00:18:52.060 --> 00:18:53.890\nIt's gonna take a while to copy.\n\n373\n00:18:53.890 --> 00:18:58.850\nThe only other thing it'll have to do is\nmake a place for us to install Windows.\n\n374\n00:18:58.850 --> 00:19:02.070\nWell, it's gotta take my hard drive and\nfree up some space.\n\n375\n00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:04.560\nAnd how much space did I have\navailable on the hard drive?\n\n376\n00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:05.580\nI didn't have any, right?\n\n377\n00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:10.720\nIf I go back in my disk utility, we'll\njust leave that running in the background,\n\n378\n00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:11.640\nand look at my disk utility.\n\n379\n00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:13.380\nHere's my Macintosh HD.\n\n380\n00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:16.193\nAnd I can see it,\nI got a terabyte drive, but\n\n381\n00:19:16.193 --> 00:19:18.866\nthe whole drive is OSX Extended Journal.\n\n382\n00:19:18.866 --> 00:19:21.003\nI don't have any empty\nspace on this drive.\n\n383\n00:19:21.003 --> 00:19:23.266\nSo if I go in here and go to partition,\n\n384\n00:19:23.266 --> 00:19:26.340\nthe whole thing is eaten\nup by this one partition.\n\n385\n00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:28.250\nI got a one terabyte drive.\n\n386\n00:19:28.250 --> 00:19:33.660\nI need to make some room to have\na spot to install Windows, okay?\n\n387\n00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:38.190\nBut how do I make room if Mac OS is\nalready eating up the whole drive?\n\n388\n00:19:38.190 --> 00:19:39.730\nWell, the wizard will\ntake care of that for me.\n\n389\n00:19:39.730 --> 00:19:43.910\nIt'll shift data around,\nassuming that I've got room for that.\n\n390\n00:19:43.910 --> 00:19:49.430\nIf I have a terabyte assigned to Mac OS,\nand I've filled it up with data,\n\n391\n00:19:49.430 --> 00:19:52.690\nthen there's no room for Windows and\nthe Boot Camp installer will fail.\n\n392\n00:19:52.690 --> 00:19:53.790\nIt just won't work.\n\n393\n00:19:53.790 --> 00:19:58.127\nYou're gonna need at least 40\ngigs of space for boot camp.\n\n394\n00:19:58.127 --> 00:20:01.565\nIt actually I like to have a little bit\nmore, but Windows kind of recommended\n\n395\n00:20:01.565 --> 00:20:05.660\nstorage is 40 gigabytes, so we wanna\nhave at least 40 gigabytes of space.\n\n396\n00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:10.080\nIf you have a laptop that only has\n256 gigs of SSD storage in it, right,\n\n397\n00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:11.940\nit's how a lot of the laptop\nI show these days.\n\n398\n00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:13.300\nThat 40 gigs, that's precious.\n\n399\n00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:16.610\nReally, every gigabyte is precious\nwhen you've only got 256 gigs.\n\n400\n00:20:16.610 --> 00:20:19.170\nSo you might not wanna give\nit more than you need.\n\n401\n00:20:19.170 --> 00:20:21.180\nBut on this computer,\nheck, I've got a terabyte.\n\n402\n00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:21.940\nI can give up a ton.\n\n403\n00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:24.450\nAnd I could say, you know what,\nlet's split the drive in half.\n\n404\n00:20:24.450 --> 00:20:30.350\nAnd we're gonna make it where it's 500\ngig for Mac OS and 500 gig for Windows.\n\n405\n00:20:30.350 --> 00:20:31.780\nAnd you can go that route.\n\n406\n00:20:31.780 --> 00:20:35.280\nJust remember that while I can\nshrink my drive to make room for\n\n407\n00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:39.450\nWindows, once this is done,\nI can't really change it.\n\n408\n00:20:39.450 --> 00:20:41.770\nI can't change it unless I delete Windows.\n\n409\n00:20:41.770 --> 00:20:43.080\nAnd so that's a lot of work.\n\n410\n00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:46.358\nSo plan for storage now.\n\n411\n00:20:46.358 --> 00:20:49.620\nDon't wait until later and you're like,\nI wish I had more space on this side or\n\n412\n00:20:49.620 --> 00:20:51.280\nthat side cuz it's really hard to change.\n\n413\n00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:52.210\nYou have to delete Windows.\n\n414\n00:20:52.210 --> 00:20:55.090\n>> Yeah, and don't forget,\nwe're not just installing Windows.\n\n415\n00:20:55.090 --> 00:20:57.576\nI mean, we are just installing Windows,\nthat's what we're gonna do on the show.\n\n416\n00:20:57.576 --> 00:20:58.117\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But later,\n\n417\n00:20:58.117 --> 00:20:59.449\nwhy are we installing Windows?\n\n418\n00:20:59.449 --> 00:21:02.542\nWell, because I have some line of business\napplication that needs to run on it.\n\n419\n00:21:02.542 --> 00:21:03.340\nWell, guess what?\n\n420\n00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:07.110\nWhen you install that, that takes\nup some hard drive space as well so\n\n421\n00:21:07.110 --> 00:21:11.300\nyou have to really figure out exactly\nhow much space you're gonna need\n\n422\n00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:14.230\nat least to get everything you want\ninstalled, plus the operating system.\n\n423\n00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:16.210\nAnd then think about growth in the future.\n\n424\n00:21:16.210 --> 00:21:17.450\nSo it is good.\n\n425\n00:21:17.450 --> 00:21:20.771\nI know it feels like you're\nsacrificing hard drive space, but\n\n426\n00:21:20.771 --> 00:21:25.173\nyou are taking advantage of both of them,\nand so don't be afraid to use that space.\n\n427\n00:21:25.173 --> 00:21:25.845\nRight, Don?\n\n428\n00:21:25.845 --> 00:21:27.135\n>> Yeah.\nAbsolutely.\n\n429\n00:21:27.135 --> 00:21:28.625\nAll right, well, right now,\nthis thing's churning along.\n\n430\n00:21:28.625 --> 00:21:30.195\nIt's copying the Windows files over and\n\n431\n00:21:30.195 --> 00:21:34.185\nthen it's gonna download the drivers\nfrom Apple and copy those over too,\n\n432\n00:21:34.185 --> 00:21:37.325\nand that process takes a little while,\nso we're gonna leverage the magic of\n\n433\n00:21:37.325 --> 00:21:40.595\ntelevision here to let this kinda cruise\nalong, but as soon as it's done, we'll\n\n434\n00:21:40.595 --> 00:21:43.810\npick right back up and we're gonna get to\nthe spot where we edit the hard drive.\n\n435\n00:21:43.810 --> 00:21:45.510\nThe hard drive's gotta get resized.\n\n436\n00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:47.810\nOnce that's done, then we're gonna reboot.\n\n437\n00:21:47.810 --> 00:21:50.390\nAnd that's when we're actually\ngonna see the really cool stuff,\n\n438\n00:21:50.390 --> 00:21:52.180\ncuz we'll install Windows.\n\n439\n00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:53.870\nSo let's just give this a moment, and\n\n440\n00:21:53.870 --> 00:21:55.860\nthen we'll be able to\nprogress through the wizard.\n\n441\n00:21:55.860 --> 00:21:57.860\nAll right, so it's had a good\namount of time here to churn along.\n\n442\n00:21:57.860 --> 00:21:59.880\nAnd now, it's prompting me for a password.\n\n443\n00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:04.039\nAnd that means that we've finished copying\nour files, we've finished downloading our\n\n444\n00:22:04.039 --> 00:22:08.030\nfiles from Apple, and now it's getting\nready to start formatting disks and, well,\n\n445\n00:22:08.030 --> 00:22:09.760\nreformatting hard disks, I guess.\n\n446\n00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:13.930\nLet me go ahead and give it the\nadministrative privileges it needs, and\n\n447\n00:22:13.930 --> 00:22:14.622\nnow's the time.\n\n448\n00:22:14.622 --> 00:22:16.970\nAll right,\nnow here's where things get a little fun.\n\n449\n00:22:16.970 --> 00:22:20.310\nIt's showing me, here's my OSX drive,\n\n450\n00:22:20.310 --> 00:22:23.060\nit's a terrabyte drive,\nbut it wants to shrink it.\n\n451\n00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:27.072\nLook how it's making 32 gigs\navailable to Windows, right there.\n\n452\n00:22:27.072 --> 00:22:27.873\nSo 32 gigs.\n\n453\n00:22:27.873 --> 00:22:29.250\nNow I said 40 gigs earlier.\n\n454\n00:22:29.250 --> 00:22:30.670\nThat's Microsoft's recommended minimum.\n\n455\n00:22:30.670 --> 00:22:34.130\nThis is actually a little bit below\nMicrosoft's recommended minimum.\n\n456\n00:22:34.130 --> 00:22:39.000\nNow the actual minimum is 20 gigs, like\nMicrosoft, that's their true requirement.\n\n457\n00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:42.400\nSo, you've got some flexibility in\nwhat that size is going to be and\n\n458\n00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:45.390\nyou can just grab this slider here and\nmove it.\n\n459\n00:22:45.390 --> 00:22:51.240\nAnd I can't go any smaller than 32 gigs,\nthat's what Apple sets as our minimum.\n\n460\n00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:52.880\nBut you can certainly go bigger.\n\n461\n00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:55.300\nSo, if you want 40,\nyou can try and get it right, and\n\n462\n00:22:55.300 --> 00:22:58.110\napparently I'm going to\nfail to get it right on 40.\n\n463\n00:22:58.110 --> 00:22:59.480\nBut you can go bigger, too.\n\n464\n00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:02.280\nRight, and remember what I said earlier,\nyou want to try and pick\n\n465\n00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:06.920\nthe right size early on, [LAUGH] cuz it's\nreally hard to fix this stuff later on.\n\n466\n00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:09.070\nSo you can fix it here.\n\n467\n00:23:09.070 --> 00:23:12.170\nIf you know you're gonna be using it\na lot, though, then you might just\n\n468\n00:23:12.170 --> 00:23:15.920\nwanna go ahead and divide things evenly\nand have it square down the middle.\n\n469\n00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:18.617\nAnd so they give you a nice little button\nthat will do that, Divide Equally.\n\n470\n00:23:18.617 --> 00:23:22.500\nAnd we can hit that and\nthere we go, 500 GB on each side.\n\n471\n00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:27.300\nNow, it's not happening to me here but\nword of caution to you.\n\n472\n00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:32.688\nYou may find where you have a terabyte\ndrive, and you're only using 300 GB of it.\n\n473\n00:23:32.688 --> 00:23:34.459\nSo you've got 700 GB free, but\n\n474\n00:23:34.459 --> 00:23:38.932\nit won't let you make a Windows partition\nmore than 80 GB or something really small.\n\n475\n00:23:38.932 --> 00:23:39.977\nAll right?\n\n476\n00:23:39.977 --> 00:23:44.831\nWhat happens is that sometimes, time\nmachine, time machine can start to write\n\n477\n00:23:44.831 --> 00:23:49.370\nfiles to the end of the drive instead\nof the middle or the beginning.\n\n478\n00:23:49.370 --> 00:23:52.096\nAnd it can cause you not to be able\nto resize your windows partition.\n\n479\n00:23:52.096 --> 00:23:53.211\nAll right,\nit's happened to me more than once.\n\n480\n00:23:53.211 --> 00:23:56.336\nIt's not happening here but\nit has happened to me more than once.\n\n481\n00:23:56.336 --> 00:23:58.274\nIf that happens.\n\n482\n00:23:58.274 --> 00:24:00.016\nIt's really, really hard to fix it,.\n\n483\n00:24:00.016 --> 00:24:04.154\nCuz you can't see where those files\nare stored out on the hard drive to move\n\n484\n00:24:04.154 --> 00:24:04.770\nthem off.\n\n485\n00:24:04.770 --> 00:24:06.750\nApple doesn't really\ngive us a way to do that.\n\n486\n00:24:06.750 --> 00:24:10.780\nAnd the best way to fix it, take\na Time Machine backup of your computer,\n\n487\n00:24:11.820 --> 00:24:15.730\nformat the computer, and\nrestore the Time Machine backup.\n\n488\n00:24:15.730 --> 00:24:18.950\nWhat that does, it puts you exactly back\nwhere you were before you formatted.\n\n489\n00:24:18.950 --> 00:24:22.390\nBut since you've formatted, all your files\nare moved to the beginning of the drive,\n\n490\n00:24:22.390 --> 00:24:26.030\nand now you'll have that freedom to\nresize the drive however you want.\n\n491\n00:24:27.370 --> 00:24:32.320\nSo just be aware that if you ever can't\nmove it to a certain size, it either means\n\n492\n00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:36.920\nthe drive is full, or it means that\nthe files are just in a bad spot, and\n\n493\n00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:38.520\nformat and\nrestore is a way to get around that.\n\n494\n00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:39.860\nBut I'm gonna go ahead and\njust divide equally.\n\n495\n00:24:39.860 --> 00:24:42.960\nWe'll split the drive in half,\nand off we go.\n\n496\n00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:44.970\nSo I'm cool there.\n\n497\n00:24:44.970 --> 00:24:46.600\nNow, it's gonna go and\npartition that drive.\n\n498\n00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:48.750\nSo I can go ahead and hit Install.\n\n499\n00:24:48.750 --> 00:24:50.560\nAnd now the magic's gonna happen.\n\n500\n00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:52.510\nSo when we go to install\nit's partitioning the disk,\n\n501\n00:24:52.510 --> 00:24:56.010\nit's shrinking the OS10\npartition down to 500 gigs.\n\n502\n00:24:56.010 --> 00:24:58.830\nAnd then,\nit's gonna take the remaining 500 gigs and\n\n503\n00:24:58.830 --> 00:25:01.630\nit's gonna create a partition\nthat is Windows readable.\n\n504\n00:25:01.630 --> 00:25:04.491\nNow, only so much.\n\n505\n00:25:04.491 --> 00:25:09.079\nApple has made it where NTFS and\nNTFS is the file system that Windows uses,\n\n506\n00:25:09.079 --> 00:25:12.060\nApple has made where NTFS is readable.\n\n507\n00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:16.315\nBut not writable, if you wanna write to\nNTFS you have to license that technology\n\n508\n00:25:16.315 --> 00:25:20.633\nfrom Microsoft and there's a limit how\nmuch Apple wants to pay to Microsoft, and\n\n509\n00:25:20.633 --> 00:25:22.491\nin this case they didn't want to.\n\n510\n00:25:22.491 --> 00:25:26.280\nSo we can't write NTFS partitions and\nit can't format it for me, so\n\n511\n00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:29.544\nit's actually gonna format\nthe partition the wrong way.\n\n512\n00:25:29.544 --> 00:25:32.970\n[LAUGH] And so, when we boot up and\nwe go into the Windows install,\n\n513\n00:25:32.970 --> 00:25:37.160\nonce we're in the Windows installer,\nwe're at the format that partition and\n\n514\n00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:39.650\nthat's the place where\nwe can make a mistake.\n\n515\n00:25:39.650 --> 00:25:43.230\nRemember how I said you can make a mistake\nand accidentally format your Mac?\n\n516\n00:25:43.230 --> 00:25:44.308\nWell, that's gonna be it.\n\n517\n00:25:44.308 --> 00:25:46.110\nNow, it's rebooted on me.\n\n518\n00:25:46.110 --> 00:25:48.430\nSo I get black screen here\nthat's going to boot up.\n\n519\n00:25:48.430 --> 00:25:50.656\nAnd what's it's gonna do\nis it's gonna reboot.\n\n520\n00:25:50.656 --> 00:25:51.970\nAnd look what it's doing.\n\n521\n00:25:51.970 --> 00:25:53.231\nIt's booting Windows.\n\n522\n00:25:53.231 --> 00:25:55.668\nI'm now booting Windows on my hardware and\n\n523\n00:25:55.668 --> 00:26:01.170\nit's actually booting from that USB key\nto get us to where we can do the install.\n\n524\n00:26:01.170 --> 00:26:04.785\nSo as it starts to boot up,\nit's booting the Windows installer.\n\n525\n00:26:04.785 --> 00:26:09.230\nIf I look over here my USB key's little\nread light is, yep, flashing away.\n\n526\n00:26:09.230 --> 00:26:10.530\nSo I gotta pop off camera to look.\n\n527\n00:26:10.530 --> 00:26:13.030\nBut it's flashing away so it's reading.\n\n528\n00:26:13.030 --> 00:26:13.700\nAnd so, letting up.\n\n529\n00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:19.875\nNow, if you have a USB 3.0, USB key,\nthen this could be pretty fast.\n\n530\n00:26:19.875 --> 00:26:24.590\nIf you have a USB 2.0, then it's gonna be\na bit slower and it could take a while.\n\n531\n00:26:24.590 --> 00:26:29.870\nNow, unfortunately, for me I got a USB\n3.0 key and no, I am in a 3 spots.\n\n532\n00:26:29.870 --> 00:26:31.510\nSo I should be going fast.\n\n533\n00:26:31.510 --> 00:26:34.840\nBut sometimes you can have like a USB 3\nkey and you plug it to a USB 2 port and\n\n534\n00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:36.220\nthen it's nice and slow again.\n\n535\n00:26:36.220 --> 00:26:37.950\nSo it's just kinda depends.\n\n536\n00:26:37.950 --> 00:26:38.560\nBut here it goes.\n\n537\n00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:40.480\nIt's starting the Windows installer.\n\n538\n00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:42.850\nAnd for\nthe most part when you install Windows,\n\n539\n00:26:42.850 --> 00:26:46.410\nwe're talking about click in next\njust a bunch of times and that's it.\n\n540\n00:26:46.410 --> 00:26:48.750\nBut there's gonna be a screen\nwhen we format our hard drive and\n\n541\n00:26:48.750 --> 00:26:50.710\nwe've really gotta pay attention.\n\n542\n00:26:50.710 --> 00:26:54.570\nIt's even harder here because I\nchose to divide the drives equally,\n\n543\n00:26:54.570 --> 00:26:58.430\nlet's say you don't divide the drives\nequally, let's say I left 750 gigs for\n\n544\n00:26:58.430 --> 00:27:01.320\nMac and just 250 gigs for Windows.\n\n545\n00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:03.500\nWell, when it comes time\nto format the disc,\n\n546\n00:27:03.500 --> 00:27:06.450\nI know exactly which one to pick\nbecause they're different sizes.\n\n547\n00:27:06.450 --> 00:27:08.310\nBut I chose to divide it evenly.\n\n548\n00:27:08.310 --> 00:27:11.869\nAnd so, it's that much harder to\nfigure out which disk to format.\n\n549\n00:27:11.869 --> 00:27:13.063\nIt's asking me what language I speak.\n\n550\n00:27:13.063 --> 00:27:14.720\nI'm gonna stick with English for today.\n\n551\n00:27:15.790 --> 00:27:17.340\nAnd now it's asking for a product key.\n\n552\n00:27:17.340 --> 00:27:20.150\nThey want us to make sure we have\na valid license for the software.\n\n553\n00:27:20.150 --> 00:27:22.980\nSo I'm gonna punch in a license key.\n\n554\n00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:26.080\nAnd the key I'm using is\na special key from Microsoft that\n\n555\n00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:28.360\nlets you do the install but\ndoesn't activate.\n\n556\n00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:31.685\nSo you're welcome to use this key if\nyou want and you already install but\n\n557\n00:27:31.685 --> 00:27:35.622\nit won't activate which means Windows will\nstop working after I think to 60 days,\n\n558\n00:27:35.622 --> 00:27:37.246\n90 days, something like that.\n\n559\n00:27:37.246 --> 00:27:37.991\n>> [CROSSTALK] Something like that.\n\n560\n00:27:37.991 --> 00:27:40.866\n>> So if you just need Windows for\na little while,\n\n561\n00:27:40.866 --> 00:27:45.239\nthis will certainly do a trick but\nnot one you wanna use all of the time.\n\n562\n00:27:45.239 --> 00:27:48.987\nWe'll see, one more or set of keys, this\nis one of the advantages that you have in\n\n563\n00:27:48.987 --> 00:27:51.910\nMac OS over Windows is that Apple,\nthey sell you the hardware so\n\n564\n00:27:51.910 --> 00:27:55.030\nthey don't require some kinda\nlicense on their software.\n\n565\n00:27:55.030 --> 00:27:58.034\nWindows on the other hand doesn't sell the\nhardware so they wanna get their money.\n\n566\n00:27:58.034 --> 00:27:58.534\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n567\n00:27:58.534 --> 00:27:59.763\n>> And so, you gotta have that\n\n568\n00:27:59.763 --> 00:28:00.560\nlicense key.\n\n569\n00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:02.010\n>> You mean they're in\nbusiness to make money?\n\n570\n00:28:02.010 --> 00:28:02.882\n>> It's crazy, isn't it?\n>> That's strange,\n\n571\n00:28:02.882 --> 00:28:03.922\nstrange ideas that they make.\n\n572\n00:28:03.922 --> 00:28:05.233\n>> Yeah.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n573\n00:28:05.233 --> 00:28:06.090\n>> So I'm gonna punch that in.\n\n574\n00:28:06.090 --> 00:28:06.780\nHopefully it'll take it.\n\n575\n00:28:06.780 --> 00:28:08.680\nIf it doesn't,\nI do have a little skip button down here.\n\n576\n00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:10.760\nBut it gets kinda nasty with\nyou if you skip the key.\n\n577\n00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:12.390\nSo there we go.\n\n578\n00:28:12.390 --> 00:28:14.600\nSo I'm installing Windows 10 Pro.\n\n579\n00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:18.230\nAnd I'll hit Next and now the glory.\n\n580\n00:28:18.230 --> 00:28:20.590\nIt's gonna look at, I should give\nan end-user license agreement.\n\n581\n00:28:20.590 --> 00:28:21.400\nThere it is.\n\n582\n00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:23.150\nAnd so, I'll sign away on that.\n\n583\n00:28:23.150 --> 00:28:25.010\nYeah, sure Microsoft, great.\n\n584\n00:28:25.010 --> 00:28:26.630\nI won't sue you, I promise.\n\n585\n00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:28.340\nAnd now the hard part, formatting it.\n\n586\n00:28:28.340 --> 00:28:31.430\nAnd I know this is kinda small on the\nscreen and Windows won't let me zoom in on\n\n587\n00:28:31.430 --> 00:28:35.110\nit but basically it's listing all\nthe partitions on my hard drive.\n\n588\n00:28:35.110 --> 00:28:39.616\nAnd it's telling me, Windows can't be\ninstalled on the current partition.\n\n589\n00:28:39.616 --> 00:28:41.519\nWell, the current partition\nis the EFI partition.\n\n590\n00:28:41.519 --> 00:28:45.079\nThat's the boot partition, and\nthen if I start looking at the other ones,\n\n591\n00:28:45.079 --> 00:28:47.580\nI don't necessarily know which one is for\nWindows.\n\n592\n00:28:47.580 --> 00:28:50.090\nWell, Apple left me a hint.\n\n593\n00:28:50.090 --> 00:28:52.910\nApple couldn't format the drive NTFS for\nme, but\n\n594\n00:28:52.910 --> 00:28:56.950\nwhat they did is they gave\nit a title of Boot Camp.\n\n595\n00:28:56.950 --> 00:28:59.369\nAnd that way, it's the wrong format, but\n\n596\n00:28:59.369 --> 00:29:04.110\nit's labeled Boot Camp so I know\nwhich one, so I can go in and format.\n\n597\n00:29:04.110 --> 00:29:08.945\nSo I can choose that partition, and then\nI can hit Format, and I'm just gonna say\n\n598\n00:29:08.945 --> 00:29:12.820\nOK to that, and it's gonna erase that\npartition, and get it set up for NTFS,\n\n599\n00:29:12.820 --> 00:29:16.230\nwhich is what Windows wants,\nthat's what's gonna make Windows happy.\n\n600\n00:29:16.230 --> 00:29:19.540\nAnd as soon as that's done,\nnow the warning message goes away and\n\n601\n00:29:19.540 --> 00:29:20.940\nI'm able to install.\n\n602\n00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:23.460\nBut there's that moment of\ntrepidation where you're like, no,\n\n603\n00:29:23.460 --> 00:29:24.140\nis that the right one?\n\n604\n00:29:24.140 --> 00:29:25.590\nAm I gonna format the wrong one?\n\n605\n00:29:25.590 --> 00:29:26.540\nLook for the title.\n\n606\n00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:28.970\nThe title of that disk will be Boot Camp.\n\n607\n00:29:28.970 --> 00:29:32.530\nNow, the other ones won't have a title,\nbecause the other ones are formatted\n\n608\n00:29:32.530 --> 00:29:35.760\nOSX extended journal,\nwhich Windows doesn't support.\n\n609\n00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:38.380\nWindows can't read that, so\nthey can't read the title.\n\n610\n00:29:38.380 --> 00:29:39.110\nBut this one it can't.\n\n611\n00:29:39.110 --> 00:29:39.980\nSo there we go.\n\n612\n00:29:39.980 --> 00:29:41.620\nI formatted, I'm good to go.\n\n613\n00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:45.810\nIf you format the Boot Camp partition and\nyou still have that warning on there,\n\n614\n00:29:45.810 --> 00:29:48.340\nI've seen that before,\nusually that means you've got\n\n615\n00:29:48.340 --> 00:29:51.610\nan extra removable drive attached to your\ncomputer and you just need to unplug it.\n\n616\n00:29:51.610 --> 00:29:54.750\nSo for example,\nmy little SSD here is still plugged in.\n\n617\n00:29:54.750 --> 00:29:57.400\nIn theory I could\naccidentally have chosen it.\n\n618\n00:29:57.400 --> 00:30:00.220\nAnd I can just unplug not\nwould make the other way.\n\n619\n00:30:00.220 --> 00:30:03.240\nBut in my case, I picked the one\nthat I want, I'll hit Next and\n\n620\n00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:06.220\nat this point,\nit's got all the information it needs.\n\n621\n00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:08.910\nSince we couldn't create a new\npartition or locate an existing one for\n\n622\n00:30:08.910 --> 00:30:13.210\nmore information see to set up,\nit got a little angry with me there so,\n\n623\n00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:18.410\nwell, I just got done saying all that\nstuff about the removal of disk.\n\n624\n00:30:18.410 --> 00:30:21.620\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nyank my removal disk, not the USB key,\n\n625\n00:30:21.620 --> 00:30:24.220\nI need the USB key cuz\nthat's were my installer is.\n\n626\n00:30:24.220 --> 00:30:27.330\nBut I'm gonna remove that one,\nand I'll hit refresh, and so\n\n627\n00:30:27.330 --> 00:30:30.110\ndrive one should disappear and\nI'll just have drive zero.\n\n628\n00:30:30.110 --> 00:30:33.100\nAnd at that point, I should be able to\nchoose this partition and move forward, so\n\n629\n00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:33.930\nwe'll give that a second.\n\n630\n00:30:33.930 --> 00:30:34.890\nThere we go.\n\n631\n00:30:34.890 --> 00:30:36.731\nSo now I just have the internal drive.\n\n632\n00:30:36.731 --> 00:30:39.390\nI'm gonna choose that partition four and\nhit Next.\n\n633\n00:30:39.390 --> 00:30:40.970\nNow, it's happy, right, Dan?\n\n634\n00:30:40.970 --> 00:30:43.460\nSee, the removable drive, every time.\n\n635\n00:30:43.460 --> 00:30:44.160\n>> Be on the lookout.\n\n636\n00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:46.864\n>> You'd think I'd listen to\nthe things that I say out loud.\n\n637\n00:30:46.864 --> 00:30:49.180\nAnd if follow my own advise but\n\n638\n00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:50.900\nI also didn't do those\nupdates earlier in the show.\n\n639\n00:30:50.900 --> 00:30:52.043\nSo I'll probable regret that, too.\n\n640\n00:30:52.043 --> 00:30:58.040\n[LAUGH] So now it's going to install\nWindows and this takes a little bit.\n\n641\n00:30:58.040 --> 00:31:00.510\nIt takes 15 or\n20 minutes while it installs it.\n\n642\n00:31:00.510 --> 00:31:03.460\nIt's got a 500 gig drive\nthat its installing.\n\n643\n00:31:03.460 --> 00:31:05.790\nAnd when it's done,\nit's gonna boot into Windows.\n\n644\n00:31:05.790 --> 00:31:08.850\nI'm gonna have an operative\nWindows environment.\n\n645\n00:31:08.850 --> 00:31:12.650\nAnd I'll still have my\noperative Mac environment.\n\n646\n00:31:12.650 --> 00:31:15.148\nAnd when I boot I'll be able\nto flip between the two.\n\n647\n00:31:15.148 --> 00:31:16.890\nThen, there's a few\ndifferent ways to do that.\n\n648\n00:31:16.890 --> 00:31:21.462\nIn Windows, you'll have this little thing\ncalled the Bootcamp Assistant that you can\n\n649\n00:31:21.462 --> 00:31:23.352\nuse to tell it to restart in OS10.\n\n650\n00:31:23.352 --> 00:31:27.642\nIn MacOS, you can use the startup disk\nsystem preference to say I wanna start up\n\n651\n00:31:27.642 --> 00:31:29.050\nfor Windows.\n\n652\n00:31:29.050 --> 00:31:33.730\nOr what I do, is just when you boot the\ncomputer, if you hold down the Alt key on\n\n653\n00:31:33.730 --> 00:31:37.650\nyour keyboard, it will show the Macintosh\nhard drive and the Windows hard drive.\n\n654\n00:31:37.650 --> 00:31:38.970\nAnd so, you can pick Windows to boot or\n\n655\n00:31:38.970 --> 00:31:43.500\nyou can pick Mac to boot at boot time just\nby holding the Alt key on your keyboard.\n\n656\n00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:45.360\nSo we have a chance to see that\nafter this install is done,\n\n657\n00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:47.230\nand we'll flip between the two systems.\n\n658\n00:31:47.230 --> 00:31:49.000\nThis is actually pretty straightforward.\n\n659\n00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:52.507\nBut again, we'll use the magic of\ntelevision here to advance this install.\n\n660\n00:31:52.507 --> 00:31:56.762\nAnd as soon as it's done, we'll get\na chance to see this boot into Windows and\n\n661\n00:31:56.762 --> 00:31:58.409\nsee the Boot Camp installer.\n\n662\n00:31:58.409 --> 00:32:00.765\nAll right ladies and gentleman so\nit looks like we're back in business now.\n\n663\n00:32:00.765 --> 00:32:03.770\nWhen the installer's done it's\ngonna boot up into Windows and\n\n664\n00:32:03.770 --> 00:32:05.930\nthere's just a little\nbit more we have to do.\n\n665\n00:32:05.930 --> 00:32:07.470\nI've got it right here on my Mac.\n\n666\n00:32:07.470 --> 00:32:10.090\nSo when Windows boots up you'll\nsee your Windows desktop and\n\n667\n00:32:10.090 --> 00:32:12.870\nyou'll be greeted by\nthe Boot Camp installer.\n\n668\n00:32:12.870 --> 00:32:15.640\nWhat's happened is it's\ninstalled Windows and\n\n669\n00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:18.420\nit's loaded some of the hardware drivers\nbut there's still a little bit of\n\n670\n00:32:18.420 --> 00:32:21.110\nApple software it wants to load and\nthat's what this wizard is.\n\n671\n00:32:21.110 --> 00:32:23.220\nSo all you have to do is kinda\ncruise right through it,\n\n672\n00:32:23.220 --> 00:32:26.600\nthere's no insane amount of\nbrain cells needed on this one.\n\n673\n00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:28.080\nWe just click next a few times.\n\n674\n00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:30.590\nIt's gonna load a few extra drivers and\n\n675\n00:32:30.590 --> 00:32:33.430\nthe boot camp service,\nwhich is really important\n\n676\n00:32:33.430 --> 00:32:36.230\nbecause that's what's gonna make this\nkinda play nice with the other systems.\n\n677\n00:32:36.230 --> 00:32:38.840\nSo it's gonna get that installed and\nput in place, and\n\n678\n00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:42.750\nwhen it's done we'll have a new\nlittle option that'll show up.\n\n679\n00:32:42.750 --> 00:32:46.270\nMy head's gonna cover it up, but down here\nin the bottom right by my system clock,\n\n680\n00:32:46.270 --> 00:32:50.100\nwhen I pull this up, I'm gonna see\na little diamond up here in here.\n\n681\n00:32:50.100 --> 00:32:54.170\nI don't have it now, I have bluetooth and\nIntel Irish graphics, and so on.\n\n682\n00:32:54.170 --> 00:32:58.060\nBut a little grey diamond will appear and\nthat's the Boot Camp Service.\n\n683\n00:32:58.060 --> 00:33:00.090\nAnd for the most part, we just ignore it.\n\n684\n00:33:00.090 --> 00:33:02.670\nBut when you pull up\nthe properties of that diamond,\n\n685\n00:33:02.670 --> 00:33:05.710\none of the options is to restart in OS X.\n\n686\n00:33:05.710 --> 00:33:09.270\nSo if I boot to Windows, and I say, all\nright, I'm ready to go back to Mac Land.\n\n687\n00:33:09.270 --> 00:33:11.320\nThen I just go over there, and\nI hit that little diamond.\n\n688\n00:33:11.320 --> 00:33:12.732\nAnd I tell it to restart in OS X.\n\n689\n00:33:12.732 --> 00:33:14.753\nAnd it boots up, and I'm in OS X.\n\n690\n00:33:14.753 --> 00:33:17.633\nAnd then, when I'm in OS X,\nif I wanna reboot into Windows,\n\n691\n00:33:17.633 --> 00:33:19.450\nI just go into my system preferences.\n\n692\n00:33:19.450 --> 00:33:21.280\nI go into my target startup disk.\n\n693\n00:33:22.410 --> 00:33:25.230\nAnd I choose the Windows drive,\nnow while it's installing one\n\n694\n00:33:25.230 --> 00:33:28.680\nthing that I like to do, well, one thing\nI like to do is finish the installer,\n\n695\n00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:30.130\nit seems to be just kind of sitting there.\n\n696\n00:33:30.130 --> 00:33:32.530\nBut, one thing I like to\ndo is rename my hard drive.\n\n697\n00:33:32.530 --> 00:33:33.269\nIn Windows,\n\n698\n00:33:33.269 --> 00:33:37.783\nthey'll always name the hard drive\nsomething silly like this, WinInstall D.\n\n699\n00:33:37.783 --> 00:33:39.580\nYou know, that's not terribly convenient.\n\n700\n00:33:39.580 --> 00:33:41.980\nBut when I look at my C drive\nit's just called local disc\n\n701\n00:33:41.980 --> 00:33:44.970\nI like to rename it to kinda\nmatch the Mac naming convention.\n\n702\n00:33:44.970 --> 00:33:48.060\nOn the Mac side,\nour hard drive is called Macintosh HD, so\n\n703\n00:33:48.060 --> 00:33:53.360\nI'm gonna rename this disk so,\nthat it's called WindowsHD.\n\n704\n00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:57.380\nAnd that way when I look at my boot\nloader, when I boot up and I hold alt on\n\n705\n00:33:57.380 --> 00:34:01.832\nthe keyboard then, I see my two drives\nI'll see Macintosh HD and Windows HD.\n\n706\n00:34:01.832 --> 00:34:05.960\nIt's pretty obvious which one is which,\nversus seeing Macintosh HD and Local Disk,\n\n707\n00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:08.845\nbecause I don't necessarily\nknow which is the local disk.\n\n708\n00:34:08.845 --> 00:34:09.681\n>> Are they the same?\n\n709\n00:34:09.681 --> 00:34:10.845\nYeah.\n\n710\n00:34:10.845 --> 00:34:12.890\nThat sounds like things I see.\n\n711\n00:34:12.890 --> 00:34:15.810\nPeople get confused with that\nkind of thing very, very easily.\n\n712\n00:34:15.810 --> 00:34:19.210\nThey don't see, aren't they the same\nthing cuz it's the local disk.\n\n713\n00:34:19.210 --> 00:34:23.250\nIs where my Macintosh HD is, so it is good\nto do some sort of labeling like this.\n\n714\n00:34:23.250 --> 00:34:26.640\nAgain, just simple little things,\nconsistency-type deals,\n\n715\n00:34:26.640 --> 00:34:28.900\nthat'll keep you out of trouble,\nand that's what it's all about.\n\n716\n00:34:28.900 --> 00:34:31.140\n>> The other thing we do while\nwe're waiting on that is,\n\n717\n00:34:31.140 --> 00:34:34.760\nI still have my boot disk set up,\nthis WININSTALL (D:).\n\n718\n00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:36.110\nAnd I just wanna show you guys,\n\n719\n00:34:36.110 --> 00:34:39.450\nthe majority of these files\nare a default Windows installer.\n\n720\n00:34:39.450 --> 00:34:41.340\nSo all this efi and sources,\n\n721\n00:34:41.340 --> 00:34:44.020\nthe boot manager,\nthat's all Windows normal installer.\n\n722\n00:34:44.020 --> 00:34:48.320\nBut this folder right here, Boot Camp,\nthat's the folder where it reached out to\n\n723\n00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:51.090\nApple and it downloaded all\nthe drivers and copied them here.\n\n724\n00:34:51.090 --> 00:34:54.650\nThis setup file is the wizard that's\nactually running here in the background.\n\n725\n00:34:54.650 --> 00:34:56.690\nSo, if this were to ever get interrupted,\nI could always come and\n\n726\n00:34:56.690 --> 00:34:58.310\nrerun it right here.\n\n727\n00:34:58.310 --> 00:35:02.080\nBut in there's a folder called drivers,\nand that's where all the hardware drivers\n\n728\n00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:06.380\nare that are going to enable the Windows\nmachine to recognize the Apple hardware.\n\n729\n00:35:06.380 --> 00:35:11.320\nSo, you'll see drivers for the wireless\ncard, bluetooth, the motherboard,\n\n730\n00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:12.320\nall that other stuff.\n\n731\n00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:13.380\nThe drivers are all right here.\n\n732\n00:35:13.380 --> 00:35:15.190\nSo, that's partly what it copied over.\n\n733\n00:35:15.190 --> 00:35:16.190\n>> Now, Don, really quickly.\n\n734\n00:35:16.190 --> 00:35:20.926\nIf this does get interrupted, will we\nbe able to come back in and start where\n\n735\n00:35:20.926 --> 00:35:25.811\nwe left off, or will we only be able to\nget into the Windows operating system or\n\n736\n00:35:25.811 --> 00:35:26.958\nwill we be hosed?\n\n737\n00:35:26.958 --> 00:35:28.629\n>> All right, once you're to this point,\n\n738\n00:35:28.629 --> 00:35:30.701\nyou'll always be able to\nget back into either OS.\n\n739\n00:35:30.701 --> 00:35:34.080\nBut if we were doing the Boot Camp\ninstall and we got interrupted,\n\n740\n00:35:34.080 --> 00:35:36.360\nwell you might not be\nable to get to Windows.\n\n741\n00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:38.170\nYour Windows installer is probably dead,\nso\n\n742\n00:35:38.170 --> 00:35:41.550\nin that case you're gonna have\nto boot back into Mac OS.\n\n743\n00:35:41.550 --> 00:35:43.680\nAnd then you can just rerun\nthe Boot Camp assistant.\n\n744\n00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:45.850\nAnd when you run that Boot Camp assistant,\n\n745\n00:35:45.850 --> 00:35:49.182\nit has an option there to remove the\nWindows partition, and you wanna do that.\n\n746\n00:35:49.182 --> 00:35:51.640\nYou wanna remove it and\ndelete everything that it did.\n\n747\n00:35:51.640 --> 00:35:54.110\nAnd then you can rerun the Boot Camp\nassistant and start over again, and\n\n748\n00:35:54.110 --> 00:35:54.960\nrun through that process.\n\n749\n00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:57.660\nSo, hopefully you don't get interrupted\nwhile you're doing it, but if you do,\n\n750\n00:35:57.660 --> 00:35:59.290\nit is not the end of the world.\n\n751\n00:35:59.290 --> 00:36:00.580\nYou'll survive.\n\n752\n00:36:00.580 --> 00:36:01.760\nAll right, so it's still churning along.\n\n753\n00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:04.942\nSee, it's installing a driver for the\nsound card right now, the Realtek Audio.\n\n754\n00:36:04.942 --> 00:36:06.136\nThere we go, Cirrus Audio.\n\n755\n00:36:06.136 --> 00:36:09.400\nI think Cirrus Audio is the microphone,\nif I remember right.\n\n756\n00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:12.240\nThe Apple External Optical Drive,\nwhich I don't have one, but\n\n757\n00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:14.070\nit loads the driver for it anyway.\n\n758\n00:36:14.070 --> 00:36:15.900\nThe Cinema Display, which I can't afford.\n\n759\n00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:19.170\nBut [LAUGH] it has the driver for that.\n\n760\n00:36:19.170 --> 00:36:21.780\nSo all these drivers are getting\nkinda put in and loaded.\n\n761\n00:36:21.780 --> 00:36:24.010\nIt's all part of Boot Camp.\n\n762\n00:36:24.010 --> 00:36:27.490\nAnd almost done, we are so close there.\n\n763\n00:36:27.490 --> 00:36:29.120\nThere we go and it's finished up.\n\n764\n00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:31.840\nNow, in the Windows world when you install\ndrivers you get the reboot for them to\n\n765\n00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:35.670\ntake effect but, it's not telling me to\nreboot, I think it will, there we go.\n\n766\n00:36:35.670 --> 00:36:38.890\nSo, now it's telling me that I need to\nrestart for this to take effect and so\n\n767\n00:36:38.890 --> 00:36:42.250\nwe can go ahead and say yes to that and\nit's gonna restart.\n\n768\n00:36:42.250 --> 00:36:45.010\nNow, at this point\nWindows is ready to rock.\n\n769\n00:36:45.010 --> 00:36:46.100\nIt's ready to use.\n\n770\n00:36:46.100 --> 00:36:49.270\nI've got a system that's\nrunning Boot Camp.\n\n771\n00:36:49.270 --> 00:36:53.100\nAnd when I boot up,\nwhich OS is it going to go to?\n\n772\n00:36:53.100 --> 00:36:57.230\nWell, the default is that it's\ngonna go to Mac OS, normally.\n\n773\n00:36:57.230 --> 00:37:00.520\nBut here during the install,\nit'll actually default to Windows.\n\n774\n00:37:00.520 --> 00:37:04.550\nAnd so it's gonna reboot, and when it\ncomes up, it should go into Windows.\n\n775\n00:37:04.550 --> 00:37:08.480\nNow I'm gonna throw my technical should in\nthere, just in case it does go to Mac OS.\n\n776\n00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:10.520\nEither way, we'll make it we'll survive.\n\n777\n00:37:10.520 --> 00:37:12.120\nIf it goes to Mac,\nwe can just boot into Windows.\n\n778\n00:37:12.120 --> 00:37:13.590\nBut, yeah, here it's going to Windows.\n\n779\n00:37:13.590 --> 00:37:17.560\nSo we need to figure out which\none we want to be the default.\n\n780\n00:37:17.560 --> 00:37:19.630\nBecause what if I'm travelling?\n\n781\n00:37:19.630 --> 00:37:20.480\nAnd I have a power outage.\n\n782\n00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:22.050\nThis machine reboots, right?\n\n783\n00:37:22.050 --> 00:37:23.460\nIn the OS back in my office.\n\n784\n00:37:23.460 --> 00:37:24.890\nSo, what does it go to?\n\n785\n00:37:24.890 --> 00:37:26.220\nWindows or Mac OS?\n\n786\n00:37:26.220 --> 00:37:29.780\nWell, it's gonna to whichever one you\nwere in last that's what it's set for.\n\n787\n00:37:29.780 --> 00:37:31.390\nSo, you've always gotta remember that.\n\n788\n00:37:31.390 --> 00:37:34.850\nKind of this thing has to make\na decision when it boots up.\n\n789\n00:37:34.850 --> 00:37:38.190\nSo it's booting right now into Windows,\nand at this point, it'll be done.\n\n790\n00:37:38.190 --> 00:37:39.500\nI got a full version of Windows, and\n\n791\n00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:41.960\nit's running right here on\nthe Mac Mini's hardware.\n\n792\n00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:43.020\nI'm not in a virtual machine.\n\n793\n00:37:43.020 --> 00:37:45.240\nI'm not using virtualization software.\n\n794\n00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:47.830\nI'm not using VMware Fusion or\nparallels desktop.\n\n795\n00:37:47.830 --> 00:37:51.020\nIt's Windows running directly on\ntop of the hardware for the Mac.\n\n796\n00:37:51.020 --> 00:37:53.412\nAnd thanks to that driver\npackage that was installed.\n\n797\n00:37:53.412 --> 00:37:56.200\nWe're gonna have full support for\neverything including the video adapter,\n\n798\n00:37:56.200 --> 00:37:58.630\nwhich is showing me just\na black screen right now.\n\n799\n00:37:58.630 --> 00:38:02.200\nIt takes a minute to initialize that,\nthe problem is on the Mac mini\n\n800\n00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:06.180\nit's using that display port out and\nthere's also and HDMI port out.\n\n801\n00:38:06.180 --> 00:38:08.050\nAnd Windows actually\nprefers the HDMI port.\n\n802\n00:38:08.050 --> 00:38:12.050\nSo it's probing that HDMI port and\nas soon as it's clear, there we go.\n\n803\n00:38:12.050 --> 00:38:14.260\nIt'll switch over to display port and\nnow we see it.\n\n804\n00:38:14.260 --> 00:38:16.940\nSo that's a little bit of an odd behavior.\n\n805\n00:38:16.940 --> 00:38:19.839\nYou'll see little odd\nbehaviors like that because.\n\n806\n00:38:20.990 --> 00:38:24.706\nApple, they've really tuned this\nhardware to work with Mac OS.\n\n807\n00:38:24.706 --> 00:38:26.885\nAnd so when we start running\na different OS on it,\n\n808\n00:38:26.885 --> 00:38:29.770\nthings aren't necessarily perfect,\nbut it's gonna come up.\n\n809\n00:38:29.770 --> 00:38:32.350\nI can get fired up, and now,\nI'm just in Windows, and\n\n810\n00:38:32.350 --> 00:38:35.370\nonce you're in the Windows world, you\ntreat it like any other Windows machine.\n\n811\n00:38:35.370 --> 00:38:36.650\nYou don't treat it like a Mac.\n\n812\n00:38:36.650 --> 00:38:37.960\nYou install your software.\n\n813\n00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:38.500\nYou work with it.\n\n814\n00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:39.690\nYou do everything you need.\n\n815\n00:38:39.690 --> 00:38:43.400\nThe only real difference is gonna be that\nlittle diamond down in the system tray,\n\n816\n00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:47.460\nwhich is what I'm dying to show you\nguys here as soon as I get logged in.\n\n817\n00:38:47.460 --> 00:38:50.645\nBut it's an exercise in patience I guess.\n\n818\n00:38:50.645 --> 00:38:51.145\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n819\n00:38:51.145 --> 00:38:52.957\nThey don't want you to get in a rush,\n\n820\n00:38:52.957 --> 00:38:55.459\nthere's no hurry.\nLet's just sit back, relax,\n\n821\n00:38:55.459 --> 00:38:56.645\nsip a pina colada.\n\n822\n00:38:56.645 --> 00:38:58.385\nAnd now welcome to Windows 10.\n\n823\n00:38:58.385 --> 00:38:59.585\n>> There we go, all right.\n\n824\n00:38:59.585 --> 00:39:00.805\nSo now we're booted up.\n\n825\n00:39:00.805 --> 00:39:02.725\nAnd if we get my giant\nhead out of the way,\n\n826\n00:39:02.725 --> 00:39:06.485\nthen down here in our system tray\nI should see my little diamond.\n\n827\n00:39:06.485 --> 00:39:08.295\nAnd wow, shoot, it hasn't appeared yet.\n\n828\n00:39:08.295 --> 00:39:09.475\nBut we'll give it just a moment.\n\n829\n00:39:09.475 --> 00:39:11.360\nThere it is, there's my diamond.\n\n830\n00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:14.170\nAnd so you can see that little diamond\nright down there in the system tray.\n\n831\n00:39:14.170 --> 00:39:15.110\nIt's hidden by default.\n\n832\n00:39:15.110 --> 00:39:16.940\nYou gotta hit this up arrow to see it.\n\n833\n00:39:16.940 --> 00:39:18.340\nCome on.\n\n834\n00:39:18.340 --> 00:39:19.760\nI don't want to use OneDrive.\n\n835\n00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:21.030\nOneDrive is lame.\n\n836\n00:39:21.030 --> 00:39:21.812\nThere we go.\nAll right.\n\n837\n00:39:21.812 --> 00:39:25.850\nSo I can see that diamond, and if I right\nclick on the diamond, I get a few options.\n\n838\n00:39:25.850 --> 00:39:28.260\nThe bottom one is the one I really\nwanna point out to you guys.\n\n839\n00:39:28.260 --> 00:39:29.820\nRestart in OS X.\n\n840\n00:39:29.820 --> 00:39:31.310\nSo I'm done with Windows.\n\n841\n00:39:31.310 --> 00:39:34.520\nI wanna get back to the Mac,\nI can choose to restart in OS 10 and\n\n842\n00:39:34.520 --> 00:39:35.870\nthat'll put me back in there.\n\n843\n00:39:35.870 --> 00:39:38.530\nI can also go to my\nBoot Camp control panel and\n\n844\n00:39:38.530 --> 00:39:42.590\nin the Boot Camp control panel you'll\nsee there's not a whole ton of options.\n\n845\n00:39:42.590 --> 00:39:46.940\nBut here I can say select the system you\nwant to use to start up the computer.\n\n846\n00:39:46.940 --> 00:39:50.030\nDo I wanna start in OS X or\ndo I wanna start in Windows?\n\n847\n00:39:50.030 --> 00:39:52.770\nAnd so I can pick and\nchoose right from here.\n\n848\n00:39:52.770 --> 00:39:54.410\nAnd boot to the appropriate one.\n\n849\n00:39:54.410 --> 00:39:55.888\nI've got that option.\n\n850\n00:39:55.888 --> 00:39:58.423\nYou also have some other options\nhere like whether you wanna enable\n\n851\n00:39:58.423 --> 00:39:59.379\nthe infrared receiver.\n\n852\n00:39:59.379 --> 00:40:01.063\nOn a Mac Mini,\nyou have an infrared receiver.\n\n853\n00:40:01.063 --> 00:40:03.060\nOn a Macbook Pro, you don't.\n\n854\n00:40:03.060 --> 00:40:04.325\nOn power.\n\n855\n00:40:04.325 --> 00:40:06.462\nDo we restart automatically\non a power failure or not?\n\n856\n00:40:06.462 --> 00:40:09.370\nAnd these are options that you\nhave if you boot to OS X, also.\n\n857\n00:40:09.370 --> 00:40:11.490\nIt's just giving you\na little exposure here.\n\n858\n00:40:11.490 --> 00:40:15.450\nWell, if I wanna boot to Mac OS,\nI can just choose this and hit OK.\n\n859\n00:40:15.450 --> 00:40:19.490\nAnd then we'll be able to boot to it or\nhit Restart, and it'll restart right now.\n\n860\n00:40:19.490 --> 00:40:24.970\nThe other thing is,\nif I browse to my hard drive, whoops.\n\n861\n00:40:24.970 --> 00:40:26.670\nIf I try and browse to my hard drive.\n\n862\n00:40:26.670 --> 00:40:27.820\nThere we go.\n\n863\n00:40:27.820 --> 00:40:32.250\nI've got that Windows HD, Macintosh HD,\nso I'm pretty good there.\n\n864\n00:40:32.250 --> 00:40:34.500\nI still have my installation media.\n\n865\n00:40:34.500 --> 00:40:37.810\nTechnically I'm done with my installation\nmedia though, I can get rid of that, so\n\n866\n00:40:37.810 --> 00:40:40.420\nI'm just gonna go in and\neject that and unplug it.\n\n867\n00:40:40.420 --> 00:40:43.260\nBecause otherwise, if I leave it,\nit can cause some problems.\n\n868\n00:40:43.260 --> 00:40:46.290\nIf I accidentally boot to the removable\nmedia that would be bad, so\n\n869\n00:40:46.290 --> 00:40:47.750\nI'm just gonna unplug that.\n\n870\n00:40:47.750 --> 00:40:50.960\nThere we go, and now I just have\nmy two internal hard drives.\n\n871\n00:40:50.960 --> 00:40:53.320\nNow what I'm gonna do is instead of\nusing the automated way to boot,\n\n872\n00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:54.720\nI'm just gonna power this thing off.\n\n873\n00:40:54.720 --> 00:40:58.580\nSo I'm gonna completely shut down, all\nright I'm gonna push my limits here and\n\n874\n00:40:58.580 --> 00:40:59.630\ntry to do two things at once.\n\n875\n00:40:59.630 --> 00:41:02.340\nI'm gonna hold Alt on my keyboard and\nI'm gonna hit Power\n\n876\n00:41:02.340 --> 00:41:06.290\non the Mac at the same time, and\nI'm gonna keep holding that Alt key down.\n\n877\n00:41:06.290 --> 00:41:08.330\nAnd what's gonna happen,\nis this gonna boot up?\n\n878\n00:41:08.330 --> 00:41:11.010\nAnd as long as I'm holding the Alt\nkey down it's gonna show me all of\n\n879\n00:41:11.010 --> 00:41:12.750\nmy bootable drives.\n\n880\n00:41:12.750 --> 00:41:14.520\nThere we go, and\nit takes it just a moment.\n\n881\n00:41:14.520 --> 00:41:16.530\nBut I can see I've got Macintosh HD.\n\n882\n00:41:16.530 --> 00:41:21.190\nI've got Windows and\nI've got recovery 10.11.3.\n\n883\n00:41:21.190 --> 00:41:24.210\nI had to look real close there,\nit's kinda small.\n\n884\n00:41:24.210 --> 00:41:25.990\nSo those are my disks right there.\n\n885\n00:41:25.990 --> 00:41:29.440\nIf I choose Macintosh HD,\nguess what I'm gonna boot OS X.\n\n886\n00:41:29.440 --> 00:41:31.960\nIf I choose Windows,\nI'm probably gonna boot Windows.\n\n887\n00:41:31.960 --> 00:41:34.540\nIf I choose Recovery,\nI'm probably going to boot Recovery.\n\n888\n00:41:34.540 --> 00:41:38.440\nSo I can certainly use the little\nBoot Camp wizard to pick who I'm gonna\n\n889\n00:41:38.440 --> 00:41:39.540\nstart up as.\n\n890\n00:41:39.540 --> 00:41:42.260\nAnd I can use the startup\ndisk option in Mac OS.\n\n891\n00:41:42.260 --> 00:41:44.620\nOr if I'm physically\nthere at the computer,\n\n892\n00:41:44.620 --> 00:41:46.810\nI can just hold the Alt\nkey while I power it on.\n\n893\n00:41:46.810 --> 00:41:50.000\nAnd I can fire up Macintosh HD,\nand then I'm gonna be in business.\n\n894\n00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:53.010\nSo this stuff works really well,\ngets us in there.\n\n895\n00:41:53.010 --> 00:41:54.590\nAnd off you go, right?\n\n896\n00:41:54.590 --> 00:41:57.620\nSo, I'm gonna boot up into Mac OS now, and\nI just want to show you guys that start up\n\n897\n00:41:57.620 --> 00:41:59.980\ndisc real quick, and\nthen we'll kinda be done with boot camp.\n\n898\n00:41:59.980 --> 00:42:02.928\nWhile waiting on that booting,\nlet me just tell you guys a little story.\n\n899\n00:42:02.928 --> 00:42:07.620\nI do wanna mention one thing, which is,\nMacs are a lot different than PCs.\n\n900\n00:42:07.620 --> 00:42:11.160\nOn a PC, like from Dell or Toshiba,\nor whoever, you boot them up,\n\n901\n00:42:11.160 --> 00:42:14.290\nyou can go right into their BIOS and mess\nwith all sorts of stuff on the back end.\n\n902\n00:42:14.290 --> 00:42:15.490\nOn an Apple, you can't.\n\n903\n00:42:15.490 --> 00:42:17.240\nThey don't let you get into the BIOS.\n\n904\n00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:18.330\nAnd for the most part you don't need to.\n\n905\n00:42:18.330 --> 00:42:20.720\nBut there are some settings\nthat we might wanna tweak.\n\n906\n00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:23.760\nWhen you boot Windows\non top of Mac hardware,\n\n907\n00:42:23.760 --> 00:42:28.410\non top of Apple hardware, for the most\npart everything just works and that's it.\n\n908\n00:42:28.410 --> 00:42:30.350\nBut there are some things\nthat can be a little quirky.\n\n909\n00:42:30.350 --> 00:42:33.460\nAnd one example is\nthe virtualization support.\n\n910\n00:42:33.460 --> 00:42:37.430\nThere's hardware virtualization support\nbuilt into intel I7s like mine here.\n\n911\n00:42:37.430 --> 00:42:43.310\nAnd when you boot up Windows it won't\nalways see that virtualization support.\n\n912\n00:42:43.310 --> 00:42:46.130\nSometimes you need to\nboot to Mac OS first.\n\n913\n00:42:46.130 --> 00:42:49.540\nAnd then reboot into Windows to\nhave those features activated.\n\n914\n00:42:49.540 --> 00:42:52.660\nAnd I've seen that with,\nlike the intel VTX instructions.\n\n915\n00:42:52.660 --> 00:42:55.690\nIf you just cold boot and\ngo right into Windows,\n\n916\n00:42:55.690 --> 00:42:57.830\nthere's some advanced functionality\nthat might be missing.\n\n917\n00:42:57.830 --> 00:42:59.430\nAnd the virtual technology extensions,\n\n918\n00:42:59.430 --> 00:43:01.570\nthose are the real ones\nthat I'm thinking of.\n\n919\n00:43:01.570 --> 00:43:04.200\nSo if you're running things\nlike Hyper-V on Windows,\n\n920\n00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:05.740\nthat can be a little bit of a problem.\n\n921\n00:43:05.740 --> 00:43:08.400\nBut otherwise all of your other\nfunctionality works great.\n\n922\n00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:12.760\nYou boot into Windows and you're now up\nand rocking with a full Windows system.\n\n923\n00:43:12.760 --> 00:43:14.320\nAnd here I'm booted into OS 10.\n\n924\n00:43:14.320 --> 00:43:19.630\nAnd if I go into my System Preferences,\nI can fire that up.\n\n925\n00:43:19.630 --> 00:43:24.030\nI can go to Startup Disc, and right here\nunder Startup Disc, I see Macintosh HD,\n\n926\n00:43:24.030 --> 00:43:26.840\nand if I wait just a moment\nthere's Windows HD.\n\n927\n00:43:26.840 --> 00:43:30.210\nRight, remember I renamed it in\nthe system so now it's called Windows HD.\n\n928\n00:43:30.210 --> 00:43:33.580\nI can select that and\nmake that my startup disk so\n\n929\n00:43:33.580 --> 00:43:38.360\nwhen I reboot it's gonna reboot and\nboot right into Windows instead of booting\n\n930\n00:43:38.360 --> 00:43:40.870\ninto the Macintosh HD\nwhich is the default.\n\n931\n00:43:40.870 --> 00:43:44.180\nSo we can certainly do that,\nI guess I kinda need to unlock it\n\n932\n00:43:44.180 --> 00:43:48.080\nfirst before that'll work out, but\nonce that's done, there we go.\n\n933\n00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:51.220\nSo now I can go and pick between the two,\nand I can say when you reboot,\n\n934\n00:43:51.220 --> 00:43:52.790\nI want you to reboot to Windows.\n\n935\n00:43:52.790 --> 00:43:55.080\nAnd I can hit restart and\nit'll do it, or I can just wait, and\n\n936\n00:43:55.080 --> 00:43:57.890\nnext time it's gonna boot up to that disk,\nall right?\n\n937\n00:43:57.890 --> 00:44:01.810\nNow also remember that the Windows\npartition is formatted NTFS, and\n\n938\n00:44:01.810 --> 00:44:06.150\nyour Mac can read NTFS,\nbut it can only read it.\n\n939\n00:44:06.150 --> 00:44:10.280\nSo if I browse into my system,\nI see Windows HD showing up\n\n940\n00:44:10.280 --> 00:44:15.030\nunder my devices now, and if I browse to\nWindows HD, there's my Windows hard drive,\n\n941\n00:44:15.030 --> 00:44:19.590\nI can browse into my user profile, and\nthere's Don Pezet, and I can go into my\n\n942\n00:44:19.590 --> 00:44:24.540\nDocuments or my Desktop, but if I go into\none of these, I don't have any files so\n\n943\n00:44:24.540 --> 00:44:27.450\nit's kind of boring, but\nlet's say I try and create a file, right?\n\n944\n00:44:27.450 --> 00:44:30.680\nIf I wanna try and save something,\nit won't let me and I'll just try and\n\n945\n00:44:30.680 --> 00:44:34.880\ntake this ISO and copy it over here to my\nDocuments see how it didn't let me do it?\n\n946\n00:44:36.328 --> 00:44:41.450\nOS X can read NTFS, it can't write to\nit because Apple didn't license that,\n\n947\n00:44:41.450 --> 00:44:44.580\nso if you want that functionality there\nare third party vendors out there,\n\n948\n00:44:44.580 --> 00:44:47.030\nI use a little program\ncalled Paragon NTFS for\n\n949\n00:44:47.030 --> 00:44:51.770\nMac, I think it costs maybe $15,\nit's not expensive,\n\n950\n00:44:51.770 --> 00:44:55.080\nyou can install it, and now your Mac\ncan read and write to NTFS drives.\n\n951\n00:44:55.080 --> 00:44:56.980\nSo if you need that functionality,\nit's out there.\n\n952\n00:44:56.980 --> 00:44:59.790\nBut by default,\nyour Mac can only read NTFS.\n\n953\n00:44:59.790 --> 00:45:03.170\n>> Yeah, if you've already thrown down\nthe multi-thousands of dollars for\n\n954\n00:45:03.170 --> 00:45:07.100\nthe system itself, and then plus the\nlicensing of the Windows operating system,\n\n955\n00:45:07.100 --> 00:45:09.130\nanother 15 bucks is probably\nworth the effort, right?\n\n956\n00:45:09.130 --> 00:45:10.630\n>> Yeah, and\nI'm glad you mentioned that, Daniel.\n\n957\n00:45:10.630 --> 00:45:14.020\nThe licensing in the Windows\noperating system with Mac OS we don't\n\n958\n00:45:14.020 --> 00:45:16.700\nhave to pay for a license because\nthey know we bought their hardware.\n\n959\n00:45:16.700 --> 00:45:18.820\nBut with Windows you've\ngotta have a license,\n\n960\n00:45:18.820 --> 00:45:20.560\nthat license key I was entering earlier.\n\n961\n00:45:20.560 --> 00:45:24.360\nSo for me to install Windows Pro here I\nhave to go buy a copy of Windows Pro.\n\n962\n00:45:24.360 --> 00:45:27.250\nI have to have that license to install it.\n\n963\n00:45:27.250 --> 00:45:28.030\nIt's not just free.\n\n964\n00:45:28.030 --> 00:45:30.400\nI mean, you can get the trial version\nfrom Microsoft and run that way for\n\n965\n00:45:30.400 --> 00:45:32.190\na little while but\nyou really do need to buy it.\n\n966\n00:45:32.190 --> 00:45:35.380\nSo you are paying for\nthat extra operating system.\n\n967\n00:45:35.380 --> 00:45:39.180\n>> Well Don, this is obviously\na very cool thing that we can do.\n\n968\n00:45:39.180 --> 00:45:41.521\nAnd not only just for business\napplications, to be honest with you.\n\n969\n00:45:41.521 --> 00:45:46.750\nI remember when I started here, this\nwas really my foray into a Mac system.\n\n970\n00:45:46.750 --> 00:45:51.080\nAnd one of the suggestions you\ngave me was use Boot Camp, right?\n\n971\n00:45:51.080 --> 00:45:54.690\nThat will help me be able to still\nfunctionally use my computer while I'm\n\n972\n00:45:54.690 --> 00:45:55.600\nlearning Mac.\n\n973\n00:45:55.600 --> 00:45:56.850\nSo maybe that's your case, right?\n\n974\n00:45:56.850 --> 00:45:58.850\nYou're in the way of.\n\n975\n00:45:58.850 --> 00:46:02.890\nI don't know Macs yet and I need that\ncomfort zone of having Windows there,\n\n976\n00:46:02.890 --> 00:46:04.530\nwe can use Boot Camp to that end, or\n\n977\n00:46:04.530 --> 00:46:08.490\nif you just got that line of business\napplication that is just gonna need that\n\n978\n00:46:08.490 --> 00:46:11.480\nWindows operating system,\nwe can use Boot Camp for that as well.\n\n979\n00:46:11.480 --> 00:46:14.410\nDon, anything else we need to let our\nviewers know before we close the show?\n\n980\n00:46:14.410 --> 00:46:16.780\n>> That's about it, it's a lot fun,\nyou can have a good time in boot camp,\n\n981\n00:46:16.780 --> 00:46:17.300\ndo a lot of stuff,\n\n982\n00:46:17.300 --> 00:46:20.430\nit does give you that safety net that\nother OS, definitely take advantage of it.\n\n983\n00:46:20.430 --> 00:46:22.030\nApple makes all that\nsoftware available for\n\n984\n00:46:22.030 --> 00:46:26.480\nfree and as new versions of Windows come\nout, Apple's always updating boot camp.\n\n985\n00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:27.680\nSo it's a good thing to use.\n\n986\n00:46:27.680 --> 00:46:29.350\n>> All right, well Don,\nthanks for stopping by.\n\n987\n00:46:29.350 --> 00:46:31.258\nThanks for\nshowing us how to use boot camp,\n\n988\n00:46:31.258 --> 00:46:33.967\nobviously a very cool feature\nof our Mac operating systems.\n\n989\n00:46:33.967 --> 00:46:36.528\nThat being said looks like we've come\nto the end of another great show.\n\n990\n00:46:36.528 --> 00:46:39.138\nHopefully guys have enjoyed it and\nlearned a little bit of something.\n\n991\n00:46:39.138 --> 00:46:41.330\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for ITproTV.\n\n992\n00:46:41.330 --> 00:46:42.597\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n993\n00:46:42.597 --> 00:46:45.244\n>> And I'm Don Pezet and\nwe'll see you next time.\n\n994\n00:46:45.244 --> 00:46:52.050\n[SOUND]\n\n",
