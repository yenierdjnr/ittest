00:00:11.918\n&gt;&gt; Your watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.918 --> 00:00:15.827\n&gt;&gt; Hello, welcome to another\nexciting episode here at ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:15.827 --> 00:00:19.863\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick, and today\nwe're doing our Mac Integration Basics.\n\n6\n00:00:19.863 --> 00:00:21.531\nAnd specifically in this episode,\n\n7\n00:00:21.531 --> 00:00:24.510\nwe're gonna be taking a look\nat directory services.\n\n8\n00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.570\nAnd here to help us with that is Mr.\nDon Pezet.\n\n9\n00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:27.540\nWelcome Don.\n\n10\n00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:29.390\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for having me, Mike,\nwe're ready to dive right in and\n\n11\n00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:31.470\ntackle some directory services.\n\n12\n00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.860\nNow, we probably need to kick things off\nwith, what do you think, some basics?\n\n13\n00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.470\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nI'm thinking what is a directory service?\n\n14\n00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:38.482\nWhat do we mean by that?\n\n15\n00:00:38.482 --> 00:00:40.253\nIt'd be a good place to start, right?\n\n16\n00:00:40.253 --> 00:00:43.506\n&gt;&gt; All right, well for a lot of us, when\nyou buy a new Mac, you power it on, and\n\n17\n00:00:43.506 --> 00:00:46.326\nit asks you what your name is,\nand you punch it in there, right?\n\n18\n00:00:46.326 --> 00:00:48.480\nAnd maybe you choose to set a password,\nmaybe you don't.\n\n19\n00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.710\nAnd when you're done,\nnow you've got your Mac.\n\n20\n00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.210\nA lot of people set their Macs up\nto do automatic logins, right?\n\n21\n00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.600\nSo you just turn on your laptop or\nyour desktop, and\n\n22\n00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.060\nit powers on, goes right into\nthe operating system, and off you go.\n\n23\n00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:04.210\nAnd for a home user, that's fine,\nthat works out great, right?\n\n24\n00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:05.830\nBut even for\n\n25\n00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.580\na home user there are scenarios where\nthat can start to become problematic.\n\n26\n00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.320\nWhat if I have two or three Macs?\n\n27\n00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.812\nOkay, well I can set them up\nto automatically log on too.\n\n28\n00:01:13.812 --> 00:01:16.196\nAnd then we'll just go or\nI set them up with the same password.\n\n29\n00:01:16.196 --> 00:01:17.509\nI'll put the same password on all three,\ngreat.\n\n30\n00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:19.695\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right, but\n\n31\n00:01:19.695 --> 00:01:23.730\nwhat if I have Macs that I want to share,\nright?\n\n32\n00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:25.250\nFor a home, this might be your family.\n\n33\n00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.180\nYou might have a husband, wife, kids,\nwhatever, that all wanna share a Mac.\n\n34\n00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:31.970\nBut they want separate profiles, right?\n\n35\n00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.360\nSeparate wallpapers, separate documents,\n\n36\n00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.510\nthey want to kind of keep\ntheir stuff separate.\n\n37\n00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:41.070\nOr maybe it's a workplace, where maybe\nyou're a real estate organization, and\n\n38\n00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.010\nyou've got a hundred realtors.\n\n39\n00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:47.260\nMeanwhile, you just have\nten computers set up.\n\n40\n00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:48.430\nI don't need 100 computers,\n\n41\n00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:51.280\ncuz the realtors should be out there\nin the field showing houses, right?\n\n42\n00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.000\nBut when they come back,\nthey use shared computers but\n\n43\n00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.290\nI want them to have separate\nidentities on these computers.\n\n44\n00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:58.760\nWell that means we're gonna have\nto set up separate user accounts.\n\n45\n00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.870\nAnd that's easy on one computer.\n\n46\n00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:03.280\nBut what if I have five computers?\n\n47\n00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:03.807\nWhat if I have ten?\n\n48\n00:02:03.807 --> 00:02:05.800\nWhat if I have 1,000 computers?\n\n49\n00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:10.290\nThink about a school, a university,\nyou might have thousands of computers.\n\n50\n00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:14.540\nAnd every time a new student enrolls,\nI don't wanna have to go and\n\n51\n00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.900\ncreate an account for them,\non all of the computers.\n\n52\n00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.460\nIf I have 3,000 computers, I don't\nwanna have to go to 3,000 computers and\n\n53\n00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:21.780\ncreate that account.\n\n54\n00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.840\nAnd god forbid if somebody\nwants to change their password.\n\n55\n00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.430\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I don't want them have\n\n56\n00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.770\nto go to 3,000 computers to\nchange their password, right?\n\n57\n00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:29.650\nIt's just not possible.\n\n58\n00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.250\nWhen you start getting into environments\nlike that, things become too complex.\n\n59\n00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.340\n&gt;&gt; So there's gotta be some way then\nthat we can kind of centralize this.\n\n60\n00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.780\nA place where I don't have to have\na separate account for each and\n\n61\n00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:38.620\nevery machine.\n\n62\n00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.779\n&gt;&gt; And that's exactly what\na directory service does, right?\n\n63\n00:02:40.779 --> 00:02:43.607\nIt says, hey,\ninstead of storing the user accounts and\n\n64\n00:02:43.607 --> 00:02:47.414\npasswords right there in each individual\nmachine, which is the default.\n\n65\n00:02:47.414 --> 00:02:49.454\nWe'll store the user accounts and\n\n66\n00:02:49.454 --> 00:02:53.334\npasswords in a centralized\ndatabase stored somewhere, right?\n\n67\n00:02:53.334 --> 00:02:54.089\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n68\n00:02:54.089 --> 00:02:55.313\n&gt;&gt; That somewhere is hopefully\n\n69\n00:02:55.313 --> 00:02:58.000\nmanaged by your IT department and\nin their server room.\n\n70\n00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.742\nBut it could be even further remote,\nsomething like an Apple ID, right?\n\n71\n00:03:01.742 --> 00:03:04.850\nA lot of us use Apple IDs\nto log in to Macs now.\n\n72\n00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:09.840\nAnd those are stored in a directory server\nthat's located in Apple's data centers,\n\n73\n00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:10.890\nright, so that's one option.\n\n74\n00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.010\nNow we don't control that option.\n\n75\n00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:18.120\nIf we wanna control it ourselves, any IT\ndepartment can set up a directory server.\n\n76\n00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.690\nAnd a directory server is a server\nthat runs a directory service.\n\n77\n00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.279\nAnd a directory service is merely\na database of user accounts and passwords,\n\n78\n00:03:26.279 --> 00:03:26.780\nright?\n\n79\n00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:30.680\nAnd they can do a lot more, there's a ton\nof bells and whistles that they can have.\n\n80\n00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:36.990\nBut at the deep down brass tacks of it,\nit's just a database of user accounts.\n\n81\n00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:40.267\nAnd when you go to log in to a computer,\nyou sit down, and you go to punching your\n\n82\n00:03:40.267 --> 00:03:43.900\nusername and your password, your computer\nis not looking at its own users.\n\n83\n00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.878\nNow it's reaching out over the network.\n\n84\n00:03:45.878 --> 00:03:47.550\nAnd it's asking a directory\nservice saying,\n\n85\n00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:50.490\nhey, somebody just gave me\nthis username and password.\n\n86\n00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:51.407\nIs it any good?\n\n87\n00:03:51.407 --> 00:03:53.460\nAnd it shares it with that server.\n\n88\n00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:55.450\nAnd the directory server will look at it.\n\n89\n00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:59.120\nAnd it will say, yeah, that's good,\nor, no, that's not good.\n\n90\n00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:00.750\nAnd then your laptop, your desktop,\n\n91\n00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:03.860\nwhatever it is that you're logging into,\nwill make a decision based on that.\n\n92\n00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:07.500\nSo directory service is really\nimportant in the enterprise space,\n\n93\n00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:08.590\nin the business world.\n\n94\n00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:10.415\n&gt;&gt; Does that help us with\nthe whole password thing?\n\n95\n00:04:10.415 --> 00:04:12.888\nDo still have to change my password\nin all these different places?\n\n96\n00:04:12.888 --> 00:04:14.870\n&gt;&gt; Well, since it's all stored centrally,\n\n97\n00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:18.825\nif I change my password on one computer,\nit's effectively changed everywhere.\n\n98\n00:04:18.825 --> 00:04:20.350\nIt's not truly changed everywhere,\n\n99\n00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:22.590\nits just changed at one place,\nin the directory.\n\n100\n00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:24.210\nCuz that's where everybody looks, right?\n\n101\n00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:28.040\nSo Mike if your laptop was joined to\na directory and my laptop was joined to\n\n102\n00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:31.900\na directory, I can log in on my\ncomputer and change my password.\n\n103\n00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.250\nI can immediately walk over to yours and\n\n104\n00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:37.540\nlog in with my new password and\nit'll work.\n\n105\n00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:41.060\nBecause Mike's laptop would also be\nlooking to the directory server and\n\n106\n00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:41.770\nnot looking locally.\n\n107\n00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:44.560\nIf it was looking locally, I'd have\nto go and change it on every machine.\n\n108\n00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:45.699\nIt's a nightmare, it's just not possible.\n\n109\n00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:50.250\n&gt;&gt; All right, Don, so now we've got\nan idea of what a directory service is,\n\n110\n00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:52.730\nare there different ones available?\n\n111\n00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:53.812\nHow do we know which one to use?\n\n112\n00:04:53.812 --> 00:04:56.000\n&gt;&gt; So there's a ton available.\n\n113\n00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.810\nAnd as far as which one we use,\n\n114\n00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:59.820\nit's usually not even a decision\nwe get to make, right?\n\n115\n00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:03.445\nSo if you work in an enterprise\nenvironment, your business,\n\n116\n00:05:03.445 --> 00:05:05.660\nwe'll already have a directory.\n\n117\n00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:06.570\nEven small and\n\n118\n00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:10.650\nmedium sized businesses will typically\nalready have a directory of some sort.\n\n119\n00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:12.940\nSo the decision is likely\nalready been made.\n\n120\n00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:16.589\nAnd well, the name of the show is Mac\nIntegration Basics which we're trying to\n\n121\n00:05:16.589 --> 00:05:19.700\nintegrate our Mac into whatever\nenvironment we've already got.\n\n122\n00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:24.140\nWell fortunately, most directory\nservers conform to a certain standard.\n\n123\n00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:26.270\nAnd that means it's pretty\neasy to get connected.\n\n124\n00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:30.386\nSo there's a standard out\nthere that's called LDAP.\n\n125\n00:05:30.386 --> 00:05:32.870\nAnd well LDAP is actually\nthe protocol we use to talk, so\n\n126\n00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:36.290\nthe Lightweight Directory Access Protocol.\n\n127\n00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:40.390\nAnd LDAP let's us talk to a directory\nof user accounts and say, hey,\n\n128\n00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:41.910\nI just got this username and password.\n\n129\n00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:43.120\nIs everything good?\n\n130\n00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:45.400\nAnd get an answer back,\nright, that's what LDAP does.\n\n131\n00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:47.650\nWell, there's a number of vendors\nout there that have created\n\n132\n00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:49.270\ndirectory services.\n\n133\n00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:53.100\nAnd most of them have taken the time\nto make those directory services\n\n134\n00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:54.820\ncompatible with LDAP.\n\n135\n00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:57.810\nAnd so we have this thing called OpenLDAP,\n\n136\n00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:00.290\nwhich is an open-source\nimplementation of LDAP.\n\n137\n00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:03.240\nAnd as long as the systems are conforming\nwith that, we can connect and\n\n138\n00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:04.740\nwe can join up, right?\n\n139\n00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:07.375\nSo the two directories that we need\nto know for the exam are probably\n\n140\n00:06:07.375 --> 00:06:10.310\nthe two more common ones that\nyou'll see out there in the field.\n\n141\n00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:15.610\nAnd that is Apple's Open Directory and\nMicrosoft's Active Directory.\n\n142\n00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:17.860\nBoth of which use LDAP.\n\n143\n00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:19.330\nThey both use LDAP to communicate.\n\n144\n00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:20.610\nAnd so that means it's very easy for\n\n145\n00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:22.452\nus to integrate our Macs\nto be able to support them.\n\n146\n00:06:22.452 --> 00:06:23.628\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n\n147\n00:06:23.628 --> 00:06:26.870\n&gt;&gt; Now it does depend on\nwhich one your business runs.\n\n148\n00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:30.350\nAnd I'll be honest with you,\nit doesn't matter if you love Microsoft or\n\n149\n00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:31.480\nhate Microsoft, but\n\n150\n00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:34.790\nMicrosoft's Active Directory is actually\none of the best directory servers.\n\n151\n00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:37.070\nAnd as a result it is the most common one.\n\n152\n00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:39.510\nWhen you're out there for\nsmall business, medium business,\n\n153\n00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:43.620\nenterprise, government, Microsoft's\nActive Directory is one of the biggest.\n\n154\n00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:45.780\nYou'll find it most everywhere.\n\n155\n00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:47.100\nThere are other ones.\n\n156\n00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:51.140\nApple's own Open Directory is part of\nthe server app that you can install.\n\n157\n00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:53.949\nSo if you've got the server app installed,\nyou can bring up Mac's or\n\n158\n00:06:53.949 --> 00:06:55.460\nApple's Open Directory.\n\n159\n00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:59.330\nIt works well but it's a very,\nvery limited feature set.\n\n160\n00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:04.150\nIt really focuses just on authenticating\nusers, that's its primary goal.\n\n161\n00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:07.690\nSo Apple's Open Directory is a good\nproduct, it's very easy to deploy, right?\n\n162\n00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:10.400\nThat's the point of most Apple products,\nright, it just works.\n\n163\n00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:13.650\nBut as a trade off,\nwe lose a lot of functionality,\n\n164\n00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:17.710\na lot of powerful features that a lot\nof businesses have come to count on.\n\n165\n00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:19.740\nWith Microsoft's Active Directory, boy,\n\n166\n00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:21.970\nyou've got a ton of features\njammed into that thing.\n\n167\n00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:23.730\nIt's very, very powerful.\n\n168\n00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:26.600\nIt's also very complex,\nvery hard to set up.\n\n169\n00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:28.810\nIt's not a click a button and\nit's up running,\n\n170\n00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:30.910\nthere's a lot of planning\nthat has to go into it.\n\n171\n00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:32.330\nBut there is a lot of power there.\n\n172\n00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:35.400\nAnd so you'll see it used\nin a lot of organizations.\n\n173\n00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:36.600\nThere's other ones, too.\n\n174\n00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:38.840\nNovell eDirectory comes to mind.\n\n175\n00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:42.969\nSome people still use domains,\nwhich are from the Unix world.\n\n176\n00:07:42.969 --> 00:07:45.780\nKerberos Realms which\nare also from the Unix world.\n\n177\n00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:47.670\nThere's a few other technologies\nthat are out there.\n\n178\n00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:51.570\nAnd because Mac OS is running\non top of a BSD kernel,\n\n179\n00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:55.949\nit actually supports a lot of that,\nyou can tie to those.\n\n180\n00:07:55.949 --> 00:07:59.762\nBut for the exam, and in the graphical\nuser interface on our system,\n\n181\n00:07:59.762 --> 00:08:02.722\nwhat you're really going to\nsee is a tendency towards\n\n182\n00:08:02.722 --> 00:08:06.243\nMicrosoft's Active Directory and\nthe Apple Open Directory.\n\n183\n00:08:06.243 --> 00:08:07.990\nThose are the two that we're gonna see.\n\n184\n00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:08.760\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic Don.\n\n185\n00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:13.120\nSo now you're saying Microsoft\nActive Directory, I'm running a Mac.\n\n186\n00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:17.430\nCan I still bring this to work,\nand am I able to join that domain?\n\n187\n00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:18.120\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n188\n00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:19.720\nYeah, the support is baked right in.\n\n189\n00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:22.002\nWe just need to get it configured and\nget it up and running.\n\n190\n00:08:22.002 --> 00:08:25.620\nSo the configuration side of this\nis really gonna be two pieces.\n\n191\n00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:28.376\nThere's the server side piece\nconfiguring the directory and\n\n192\n00:08:28.376 --> 00:08:31.609\nthen there's the work station side\npiece which is what we need to know for\n\n193\n00:08:31.609 --> 00:08:34.420\nthe exam,\nhow to get our Mac join to that directory.\n\n194\n00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:36.170\nYou'll find the server side piece.\n\n195\n00:08:36.170 --> 00:08:39.590\nIt's actually pretty similar across\nthe different products that are out there.\n\n196\n00:08:39.590 --> 00:08:42.300\nAnd I know this is a Mac show, but\nlet me show you what it looks like.\n\n197\n00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:46.240\nI'm gonna jump over to a Windows\nserver here, I've got one here.\n\n198\n00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:50.720\nSo this is a Windows server that is up and\nacting as an Active Directory.\n\n199\n00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:55.395\nAnd if I go into its Active Directory\nusers and computers.\n\n200\n00:08:55.395 --> 00:08:59.545\nI'm just gonna drill into this real quick,\nand\n\n201\n00:08:59.545 --> 00:09:04.947\nwhat we're going to see is\nbasically a list of user accounts.\n\n202\n00:09:04.947 --> 00:09:07.243\nAnd i'm gonna see user\naccounts as well as groups, so\n\n203\n00:09:07.243 --> 00:09:08.885\nit's actually kind of mixture here.\n\n204\n00:09:08.885 --> 00:09:11.591\nLet me just kinda get the users together,\nso\n\n205\n00:09:11.591 --> 00:09:15.040\nactually I got three users\nout of this whole giant list.\n\n206\n00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:15.596\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n207\n00:09:15.596 --> 00:09:20.750\nhere's these user accounts that are being\nstored in a centralized directory.\n\n208\n00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:23.470\nAnd if I want somebody like\nMike to be able to login and\n\n209\n00:09:23.470 --> 00:09:28.380\nauthenticate, I would need to come\nin here and create that account.\n\n210\n00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:31.570\nSo I can come in here and\nI can create a new user.\n\n211\n00:09:32.590 --> 00:09:35.410\nAnd when I specify the user,\nI just need to provide some information.\n\n212\n00:09:35.410 --> 00:09:39.491\nSo this might be Mike Rodrick,\nand I'll give him a log in name,\n\n213\n00:09:39.491 --> 00:09:42.200\nhowever it is I want it to be, right?\n\n214\n00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:44.310\nNow notice the different\nlog in names that show up.\n\n215\n00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:47.810\nThis is kind of important,\nbecause in the Apple world,\n\n216\n00:09:47.810 --> 00:09:49.700\nwe're used to just seeing one name.\n\n217\n00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:53.850\nIt's usually our full names so\nlike mine would be Don space Pezet.\n\n218\n00:09:53.850 --> 00:09:56.990\nBut in the background,\nyou've actually got Unix under the hood.\n\n219\n00:09:56.990 --> 00:09:59.490\nAnd you'll have a second\nuser name that you don't\n\n220\n00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:01.590\nusually see inside of the Mac world right?\n\n221\n00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:02.572\nSo there's this kind of hidden user name.\n\n222\n00:10:02.572 --> 00:10:05.891\nWell in Microsoft's Active Directoty\nis the same way,\n\n223\n00:10:05.891 --> 00:10:08.650\nyou've got different\nforms of the username.\n\n224\n00:10:08.650 --> 00:10:13.565\nAnd so that's what I'm seeing\nhere when I look at this I've got\n\n225\n00:10:13.565 --> 00:10:15.993\nmrodrick@lab.itpro.tv.\n\n226\n00:10:15.993 --> 00:10:18.720\nBut I've also got LAB slash mrodrick.\n\n227\n00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:21.930\nAnd these are different formats for\nthe name.\n\n228\n00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:23.660\nThe name up here is the actual name.\n\n229\n00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:28.600\nSo mrodrick@lab.itpro.tv,\nthat's Mike's actual user account.\n\n230\n00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:31.176\nSo mrodrick is his user name and then at\n\n231\n00:10:31.176 --> 00:10:36.560\nlab.itpro.tv is describing the database\nwhere the user accounts are stored.\n\n232\n00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:38.940\nA lot of companies will make\nthese match your email address.\n\n233\n00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:39.708\nIt's easier to log in, right?\n\n234\n00:10:39.708 --> 00:10:43.209\nI don't wanna have to tell people,\nhey here's this address you log in your\n\n235\n00:10:43.209 --> 00:10:46.501\ncomputer with, and then you have\na different email address, right?\n\n236\n00:10:46.501 --> 00:10:50.137\nBut if we make them the same,\nnow you log in with your email address and\n\n237\n00:10:50.137 --> 00:10:52.029\nthat makes a lot more sense, okay?\n\n238\n00:10:52.029 --> 00:10:57.380\nThen, we've got the second piece\nhere which is LAB slash mrodrick.\n\n239\n00:10:57.380 --> 00:11:01.660\nThis is the old format for Microsoft name,\nsee it was pre-Windows 2000.\n\n240\n00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:05.031\nAnd so it says mrodrick, but\nbefore it's got LAB slash.\n\n241\n00:11:05.031 --> 00:11:09.910\nLAB slash is what's called\nthe NetBIOS name for that domain.\n\n242\n00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:12.810\nThe new way of writing it would\nbe lab.itpro.tv which looks like\n\n243\n00:11:12.810 --> 00:11:13.490\na DNS name, right?\n\n244\n00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:15.640\nIt's called a fully qualified domain name.\n\n245\n00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:18.310\nThe old way was a NetBIOS name.\n\n246\n00:11:18.310 --> 00:11:19.710\nBut they're both still support.\n\n247\n00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:21.911\nAnd why are they still supported?\n\n248\n00:11:21.911 --> 00:11:25.921\nWell because a lot of non-Microsoft\noperating systems used the old way to\n\n249\n00:11:25.921 --> 00:11:26.510\nconnect.\n\n250\n00:11:26.510 --> 00:11:29.020\nAnd so they keep support for that.\n\n251\n00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:32.550\nAnd we'll find in our Macs\nthat they can use the old way.\n\n252\n00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:33.769\nThey can use the new way too,\nthey support both.\n\n253\n00:11:33.769 --> 00:11:34.785\nBut if you have an older Mac.\n\n254\n00:11:34.785 --> 00:11:38.151\nIf you've got something\nrunning like a 10.6 or\n\n255\n00:11:38.151 --> 00:11:41.833\n10.7, then they'll still\nuse the older method for\n\n256\n00:11:41.833 --> 00:11:46.702\nconnecting and that support is still\nthere, so we'll see that in place.\n\n257\n00:11:46.702 --> 00:11:50.541\nBut from here I can come in and\njust specify a password for Mike so\n\n258\n00:11:50.541 --> 00:11:52.144\nthat he can get logged in.\n\n259\n00:11:52.144 --> 00:11:53.406\n&gt;&gt; Abc123.\n\n260\n00:11:53.406 --> 00:11:55.799\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, 1234 is the standard password.\n\n261\n00:11:55.799 --> 00:11:57.268\n[LAUGH] Put your secure password,\n\n262\n00:11:57.268 --> 00:12:00.360\nwe'll talk more about passwords\nin the security episodes.\n\n263\n00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:03.340\nAnd then any other information\nI wanna specify for him.\n\n264\n00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:06.550\nBut basically we just need to get this\nsetup the way that he needs it for\n\n265\n00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:07.930\nhis user account.\n\n266\n00:12:07.930 --> 00:12:10.050\nAnd now he's got an account.\n\n267\n00:12:10.050 --> 00:12:13.210\nAnd if I have one computer\nconnected to this directory or\n\n268\n00:12:13.210 --> 00:12:17.090\nif I have 10,000 computers connected to\nthis directory, he can now go to any of\n\n269\n00:12:17.090 --> 00:12:22.230\nthem and login with his username and\nhis password, it will be his account.\n\n270\n00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:23.800\nAnd if he changes his password,\n\n271\n00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:26.252\nhe'd be able to use the new password\non any of those machines, right?\n\n272\n00:12:26.252 --> 00:12:28.050\nThat's the power of having\ncentralized directory.\n\n273\n00:12:28.050 --> 00:12:31.980\n&gt;&gt; Big advantage over trying to do that\non each and every individual machine.\n\n274\n00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:32.750\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n275\n00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:36.376\nAnd what I just did was\non the Microsoft side.\n\n276\n00:12:36.376 --> 00:12:38.680\nOn the Apple side,\nit's not much different, right?\n\n277\n00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:43.239\nSo here I am on a MAC server which\nremember that a Mac's server is really\n\n278\n00:12:43.239 --> 00:12:48.080\njust to assist the running Mac OS, so\nyou could take any MacBook or iMac.\n\n279\n00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:51.358\nA lot of people take Mac minis and use\nthem for servers they were great for that.\n\n280\n00:12:51.358 --> 00:12:53.388\nBut it's just the standard\nInsult to Mac OS here.\n\n281\n00:12:53.388 --> 00:12:56.002\nAnd now I turned the wallpaper\noff because I don't know,\n\n282\n00:12:56.002 --> 00:12:57.540\nI just have a habit of doing that.\n\n283\n00:12:57.540 --> 00:12:58.219\n&gt;&gt; It's a bit more like the server.\n\n284\n00:12:58.219 --> 00:13:00.948\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You you don't help me remember I'm on\n\n285\n00:13:00.948 --> 00:13:03.242\na server And\nthen I deleted a bunch of icons down here.\n\n286\n00:13:03.242 --> 00:13:06.049\nLike I didn't want to have\nthe mail icon or contacts, or\n\n287\n00:13:06.049 --> 00:13:08.939\nreminders because I'm not\ngoing to use that on a server.\n\n288\n00:13:08.939 --> 00:13:10.600\nSo I've turned a lot of that stuff off.\n\n289\n00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:14.790\nBut at the end of the day this\nis basically a Mac OS install.\n\n290\n00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:20.070\nAnd I've installed the server app right\nfrom the app store to become that server.\n\n291\n00:13:20.070 --> 00:13:23.120\nAnd in the server app it's got a number\nof different things that it can\n\n292\n00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:24.490\nprovide for us.\n\n293\n00:13:24.490 --> 00:13:27.750\nIf you wanna set up a file server or\na web server.\n\n294\n00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:32.320\nIf you wanna do a messaging server or\nemail, it can do all of that.\n\n295\n00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:36.820\nBut what I'm concerned about here\nis the directory side of things.\n\n296\n00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:41.270\nAnd if I look at all the services that are\navailable way down here under advanced,\n\n297\n00:13:41.270 --> 00:13:43.010\nyou'll see Open Directory.\n\n298\n00:13:43.010 --> 00:13:46.140\nAnd I've got this server set up\nas an Open Directory server.\n\n299\n00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:51.200\nAnd this one is called od.itpro.tv\nwhich is the Open Directory ProTV.\n\n300\n00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:55.068\nYou can call it whatever you want,\ncall it bob.itpro.tv it will work fine,\n\n301\n00:13:55.068 --> 00:13:58.177\nbut it's really, really hard to\nbe change the name later on.\n\n302\n00:13:58.177 --> 00:14:01.430\nSo you wanna try and\npick something consistent.\n\n303\n00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:03.854\nFor those of you that go on\nto do Mac management basics,\n\n304\n00:14:03.854 --> 00:14:06.855\nwho actually go through how\nto set up an Open Directory.\n\n305\n00:14:06.855 --> 00:14:10.105\nBut what I wanna highlight here is not so\nsuch how to get a setup but how to use it.\n\n306\n00:14:10.105 --> 00:14:15.150\nAnd you'll see right up here,\nI've got users in groups.\n\n307\n00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:17.690\nAnd I can set up users in\ngroups on this server.\n\n308\n00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:22.070\nAnd there's going to be accounts that are\nright here on this server, local accounts.\n\n309\n00:14:22.070 --> 00:14:26.290\nNotice my help desk account\nshows up as Local Directory.\n\n310\n00:14:26.290 --> 00:14:30.680\nBut then my Don Pezet account shows\nup as Local Network Directory.\n\n311\n00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:32.021\nThat's a network account, right?\n\n312\n00:14:32.021 --> 00:14:35.020\nThat's a domain account, so\nif somebody's on the network and\n\n313\n00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:37.462\nthey wanna authenticate against this,\nthey can.\n\n314\n00:14:37.462 --> 00:14:40.460\nAnd that's really that key piece\nof setting up a directory.\n\n315\n00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:44.730\nAnd so anytime I add a new user, when I go\nto create this new user it's gonna ask me\n\n316\n00:14:44.730 --> 00:14:48.070\nam I doing a local account or\na network directory account.\n\n317\n00:14:48.070 --> 00:14:49.810\nAnd we'll usually want\nnetwork directories.\n\n318\n00:14:49.810 --> 00:14:53.440\nSo I could come in here and\nI could set up a account for Mike Rodrick.\n\n319\n00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:56.940\nAnd then noticed how I actually\ndo see the two names, right?\n\n320\n00:14:56.940 --> 00:14:58.920\nThe full name and the account name.\n\n321\n00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:01.140\nThe full name is what we see in Mac OS and\n\n322\n00:15:01.140 --> 00:15:03.922\nthe account name is what we see\nin UNIX under the hood, right?\n\n323\n00:15:03.922 --> 00:15:06.460\nThat's the other name is kind\nof hidden behind the scenes.\n\n324\n00:15:08.130 --> 00:15:10.310\nAnd then we can specify a password\njust like we did under Windows,\n\n325\n00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:11.370\nnot much difference there.\n\n326\n00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:16.330\nAnd any other settings that we need\nto specify that pertain to that user.\n\n327\n00:15:16.330 --> 00:15:20.886\nAnd once that's done, we just create the\naccount and now I've got an account for\n\n328\n00:15:20.886 --> 00:15:22.570\nMike here in this directory.\n\n329\n00:15:22.570 --> 00:15:23.610\nSo I've got accounts for\n\n330\n00:15:23.610 --> 00:15:27.730\nMike in both, in my Open Directory as\nwell as my Microsoft Active directory.\n\n331\n00:15:27.730 --> 00:15:30.850\nNow I'm rooting both here just for\nthe show to demonstrate to you guys,\n\n332\n00:15:30.850 --> 00:15:36.310\nin real life land, you really don't want\nto run two different directory servers.\n\n333\n00:15:36.310 --> 00:15:38.120\nYou normally gonna run one.\n\n334\n00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:40.280\nBecause it's very difficult,\nusually it's not\n\n335\n00:15:41.370 --> 00:15:45.920\neasily possible to synchronize accounts\nbetween two directory servers, right?\n\n336\n00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:48.320\nYou don't have to set up what is called\na federation or those sort of stuffs.\n\n337\n00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:51.010\nAnd you quickly get outside\nof what Apple supports.\n\n338\n00:15:51.010 --> 00:15:54.220\nApple supports basic authentication\nwith Open Directory and that's it.\n\n339\n00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:56.850\nIf you go beyond that like\nsynchronizing to another directory,\n\n340\n00:15:56.850 --> 00:15:57.830\nthey won't support you there.\n\n341\n00:15:57.830 --> 00:15:58.788\nThey're not gonna be able\nto help you with that.\n\n342\n00:15:58.788 --> 00:16:01.468\nSo we've gotta keep that in\nmind as we get this set up.\n\n343\n00:16:01.468 --> 00:16:04.230\nYou wanna pick one directory and\nstick with it.\n\n344\n00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:06.260\n[LAUGH] That's typically.\n\n345\n00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:08.981\nGood advice with any\ntechnology these days.\n\n346\n00:16:08.981 --> 00:16:11.710\nAll right so,\nbasically I've got these accounts set up.\n\n347\n00:16:11.710 --> 00:16:15.890\nThe only thing that I'm missing\nis getting my Mac set up.\n\n348\n00:16:15.890 --> 00:16:21.980\nOn the Mac when you log into your Mac, so\nif I take this one here for example and\n\n349\n00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:27.220\nI'm gonna go in and\njust kinda log out here.\n\n350\n00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:32.050\nWhen we're looking at the log in screen\nfor a Mac, if you power it on, if you have\n\n351\n00:16:32.050 --> 00:16:35.540\nit set for automatic logon it just logs\nyou in and you never see anything, right?\n\n352\n00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:37.660\nBut, if you're not set up for\nautomatic login,\n\n353\n00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:40.190\nwhen you login to the computer you're\ngonna see this screen right here.\n\n354\n00:16:40.190 --> 00:16:44.440\nAnd what we're normally looking\nat is our user account name.\n\n355\n00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:45.150\nAnd then the password field.\n\n356\n00:16:45.150 --> 00:16:47.220\nAnd if you've only got one account,\nthat's it.\n\n357\n00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:49.280\nYou may have added more local accounts,\nand so\n\n358\n00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:52.540\nyou'd see more than one little\nbubble here for that, right.\n\n359\n00:16:52.540 --> 00:16:54.966\nBut if you've only added one account,\nyou're just gonna see that.\n\n360\n00:16:54.966 --> 00:16:57.470\nIn fact, I think on my other Mac,\nlet me go to this one.\n\n361\n00:16:57.470 --> 00:16:59.590\nPretty sure I've got more than\none account set up on this one.\n\n362\n00:17:00.790 --> 00:17:03.158\nAnd so, we'll see multiple bubbles.\n\n363\n00:17:03.158 --> 00:17:05.990\nActually, I kind of need\nto hit my back arrow.\n\n364\n00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:09.860\nSo, I'm already clicked on this by\ndefault, if I hit my back arrow it's gonna\n\n365\n00:17:09.860 --> 00:17:13.770\ntake me back where I see my actual list\nof users, and yeah I just have one user.\n\n366\n00:17:13.770 --> 00:17:16.870\nSo I don't have a Don Pezet\naccount on this computer,\n\n367\n00:17:16.870 --> 00:17:20.312\nI have a Mike Roderick account on this\ncomputer, I just have, help desk.\n\n368\n00:17:20.312 --> 00:17:22.840\nLet see account I created\nwhen I first installed this.\n\n369\n00:17:22.840 --> 00:17:27.590\nAnd so, I'm gonna log in as that user and\n\n370\n00:17:27.590 --> 00:17:30.400\nonce I'm logged in,\nthis is all just local, right?\n\n371\n00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:32.810\nSo, you had nothing to do with\nany other computer on my network.\n\n372\n00:17:32.810 --> 00:17:35.660\nI need to connect this to the directory\nto be able to participate in.\n\n373\n00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:38.570\nSo, I'm gonna go up into\nmy system preferences.\n\n374\n00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:43.610\nAnd inside of System Preferences,\nyou'll find your users and groups.\n\n375\n00:17:43.610 --> 00:17:46.490\nAnd this is where we would go if we wanna\ncreate more local user accounts, right?\n\n376\n00:17:46.490 --> 00:17:48.150\nSo, I've got a local user account for\nhelp desk.\n\n377\n00:17:48.150 --> 00:17:48.870\nI could add more.\n\n378\n00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:51.050\nI could add a Don Pezet or a Mike Rodrick.\n\n379\n00:17:51.050 --> 00:17:55.210\nBut they would exist solely\non this computer, right?\n\n380\n00:17:55.210 --> 00:17:59.560\nSo if I come in here, and I go into\nwell let me unlock this real quick.\n\n381\n00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:02.490\nYou have to be an administrator to\nmake changes so I have to unlock it.\n\n382\n00:18:02.490 --> 00:18:09.210\nIf I were to add in a new user,\nlike Christopher Watkin.\n\n383\n00:18:09.210 --> 00:18:10.460\nWe'll give him a login,\n\n384\n00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:14.840\nthat's a long username so maybe I'll\nshorten that up a bit, there we go.\n\n385\n00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:16.730\nSo, I'm gonna create a user account for\nhim, right?\n\n386\n00:18:16.730 --> 00:18:20.660\nWell, when I do that it's\ncreating that user account\n\n387\n00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:24.210\nright here straight on this computer.\n\n388\n00:18:24.210 --> 00:18:27.520\nOkay, so this computer now has\nthat Christopher Watkin account.\n\n389\n00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:31.380\nIf I jump over to my other Mac,\nit's not gonna see that,\n\n390\n00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:33.380\nright it's separate systems.\n\n391\n00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:36.690\nThere's no synchronization of\nthose accounts by default and\n\n392\n00:18:36.690 --> 00:18:37.730\nthat's not gonna show up.\n\n393\n00:18:37.730 --> 00:18:42.444\nSo, if I jump into my system\npreferences and my users and groups,\n\n394\n00:18:42.444 --> 00:18:45.260\nno Christopher Walken, okay?\n\n395\n00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:48.930\nSo, that's the main problem\nwith not having a directory.\n\n396\n00:18:48.930 --> 00:18:53.420\nBut over here if I take it,\nwhen I'm looking at my user accounts,\n\n397\n00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:57.330\nI can hit the gear, actually not the gear,\nthe log in options.\n\n398\n00:18:57.330 --> 00:18:59.960\nThere we go,\nI can hit the log in options button.\n\n399\n00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:03.180\nAnd I'll see a bunch of settings that\nwe can tweak, like automatic login.\n\n400\n00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:05.220\nIf I have more than one user,\nI don't want automatic login, so\n\n401\n00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:06.710\nI can turn that off, right?\n\n402\n00:19:06.710 --> 00:19:08.080\nIt's pretty common.\n\n403\n00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:11.390\nBut what I'm looking for is this one\nright here, Network Account Server,\n\n404\n00:19:11.390 --> 00:19:13.000\nand there's a Join button.\n\n405\n00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:16.370\nThis means we're gonna connect\nour Mac to a directory server.\n\n406\n00:19:16.370 --> 00:19:18.880\nRight, we're gonna get connected\nto a Microsoft Active Directory or\n\n407\n00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:22.250\nOpen Directory, Open LDAP, whatever it is\nthat we're gonna choose to connect to.\n\n408\n00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:27.330\nWhen we hit Join, it's gonna ask us for\nsome basic information.\n\n409\n00:19:27.330 --> 00:19:31.520\nAnd what we need to provide\nare really three things.\n\n410\n00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:34.230\nOne, the name of the server\nthat's holding the directory,\n\n411\n00:19:34.230 --> 00:19:37.262\nand there might be more than one server so\nusually any one will do, right?\n\n412\n00:19:37.262 --> 00:19:40.320\nYou're gonna pick one server\nthat is hosting that directory.\n\n413\n00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:43.500\nIn the Microsoft world they call them\ndomain controllers ,so this would be\n\n414\n00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:45.720\nthe name of a domain\ncontroller on your network.\n\n415\n00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:49.620\nIn the Mac world they're just servers\nthat run open directory [LAUGH] be\n\n416\n00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:52.590\nwhichever server your\nadministrator tells you.\n\n417\n00:19:52.590 --> 00:19:54.400\nBut we're gonna punch in\nthat name right here.\n\n418\n00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:56.035\nSometimes you can browse and find them,\n\n419\n00:19:56.035 --> 00:19:58.211\nthey'll actually show up\nhere in your drop down box.\n\n420\n00:19:58.211 --> 00:20:01.680\nAnd you'll see LAB-SERVERlab01.local\nis showing up for me.\n\n421\n00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:03.640\nIt found that one on the network.\n\n422\n00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:05.940\nThat works out great if\nyou have a single sub net.\n\n423\n00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:10.390\nIf you just have one IP network, one IP\nsubnet, you'll find and discover them.\n\n424\n00:20:10.390 --> 00:20:12.733\nYou don't even have know the server name,\nright?\n\n425\n00:20:12.733 --> 00:20:14.576\nBut if you have more than one subnet,\n\n426\n00:20:14.576 --> 00:20:18.860\nit's possible that the server's gonna\nbe on the other side of the router.\n\n427\n00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:20.590\nAnd you won't be able to\ndiscover it anymore and\n\n428\n00:20:20.590 --> 00:20:24.850\nyou'll have to type in the name to\nbe able to connect to it, correct?\n\n429\n00:20:24.850 --> 00:20:28.410\nThe other thing that you have here\nis the open directory utility.\n\n430\n00:20:28.410 --> 00:20:31.230\nIf you are not sure if it's the right\nserver you can fire that utility and\n\n431\n00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:33.410\nprovide some credentials to see if\nyou can run some ports against it.\n\n432\n00:20:33.410 --> 00:20:35.820\nIt's a pretty advanced tool\nthat was not designed for\n\n433\n00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:38.260\nn users and\nyou've got to understand how to write\n\n434\n00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:41.180\nthe add up query which are not\nthe easiest thing on the world to write.\n\n435\n00:20:42.470 --> 00:20:44.740\nAll right, now I said we needed to\ngive it three pieces of information,\n\n436\n00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:46.200\nI've only given it one, a server name.\n\n437\n00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:50.000\nThe other two pieces of information\nare a valid username and\n\n438\n00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.410\npassword on the directory.\n\n439\n00:20:52.410 --> 00:20:56.180\nSomebody that has permissions to\nadd a computer to the directory.\n\n440\n00:20:56.180 --> 00:20:58.330\nNot just anybody can do that right?\n\n441\n00:20:58.330 --> 00:21:00.209\nSo, when I say okay to this.\n\n442\n00:21:01.350 --> 00:21:03.380\nIt's gonna try, and find that server.\n\n443\n00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:04.900\nAnd when it finds it.\n\n444\n00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:10.410\nIt found the serverLAB-SERVERlab01.local,\nand it's validating your certificate.\n\n445\n00:21:10.410 --> 00:21:12.870\nWe need to have an encrypted\nconnection between us, and the server,\n\n446\n00:21:12.870 --> 00:21:15.550\ncuz we're passing user names,\nand passwords.\n\n447\n00:21:15.550 --> 00:21:19.217\nWe're not actually passing the password,\nwe're sending out a hashed version of it.\n\n448\n00:21:19.217 --> 00:21:22.230\nBut it's still something that somebody\ncan attack so it needs to be encrypted.\n\n449\n00:21:22.230 --> 00:21:25.447\nSo, I'm gonna trust\nthe certificate from my server and\n\n450\n00:21:25.447 --> 00:21:29.418\nthen actually I didn't bother to set\nup my server for certificates so\n\n451\n00:21:29.418 --> 00:21:32.095\nall right I'm just gonna\ncontinue past that.\n\n452\n00:21:32.095 --> 00:21:33.680\nSo [LAUGH] ideally we wanna set that up.\n\n453\n00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:36.777\nI set my server up real quick so\nI didn't set up a certificate.\n\n454\n00:21:36.777 --> 00:21:38.550\nSo, now I'm connected.\n\n455\n00:21:38.550 --> 00:21:40.490\nAnd I've established a connection now.\n\n456\n00:21:40.490 --> 00:21:44.510\nIt didn't ask for a username and\na password, why not?\n\n457\n00:21:44.510 --> 00:21:49.170\nWell it didn't because I'm\nlogged in as help desk, and\n\n458\n00:21:49.170 --> 00:21:53.180\nI created a help desk account on that\nserver also and the password's the same.\n\n459\n00:21:53.180 --> 00:21:55.550\nSo, it handed off the user name and\npassword for\n\n460\n00:21:55.550 --> 00:21:57.400\nme because they already matched.\n\n461\n00:21:57.400 --> 00:22:00.670\nIf you didn't do that though, if I was\nlogged in as Don Pezet for example, or\n\n462\n00:22:00.670 --> 00:22:03.370\nChristopher Watkin fo that matter,\nthen it would prompt me and say,\n\n463\n00:22:03.370 --> 00:22:05.490\nplease give me the username and\npassword, right?\n\n464\n00:22:05.490 --> 00:22:07.880\nBut because I all ready\nhad matching credentials,\n\n465\n00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:10.860\nthey cross authenticate it and they let me\nthrough I didn't have to provide the other\n\n466\n00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:12.180\ntwo pieces of information.\n\n467\n00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:13.610\n&gt;&gt; And I think you said this already, Don,\n\n468\n00:22:13.610 --> 00:22:16.100\nbut Christopher wouldn't be\nable to add himself, right?\n\n469\n00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:18.570\nHe would need somebody with\nspecial permissions for that.\n\n470\n00:22:18.570 --> 00:22:21.370\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, he would have to have\nthat account in the directory, right?\n\n471\n00:22:21.370 --> 00:22:25.520\nAnd if I were to go back, so what I just\nconnected to was the Apple Open Directory.\n\n472\n00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:28.350\nAnd so if I jump over here\nto my Open Directory server,\n\n473\n00:22:28.350 --> 00:22:30.450\nsee how the HelpDesk account is here and\ngranted?\n\n474\n00:22:30.450 --> 00:22:34.940\nIt's a local directory one, but\nit is part of the Open Directory.\n\n475\n00:22:34.940 --> 00:22:36.760\nBecause it was what created\nthe open directory.\n\n476\n00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:38.950\nIt was kind of the one\nexception to the rule.\n\n477\n00:22:38.950 --> 00:22:40.630\nAnd so, that one already matched.\n\n478\n00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:42.400\nBut Christopher Watkins\naccount is not here.\n\n479\n00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:45.750\nSo if he provided his credentials,\nthey wouldn't work, but you or\n\n480\n00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:48.690\nI could because we have\nvalid user accounts.\n\n481\n00:22:48.690 --> 00:22:52.540\nNow, I can cuz I'm an admin,\nyou can and you're not an admin.\n\n482\n00:22:52.540 --> 00:22:55.390\nBut that's because you're\na valid user on the directory,\n\n483\n00:22:55.390 --> 00:22:57.810\nit will make sense that you'll\nneed a computer, right?\n\n484\n00:22:57.810 --> 00:23:00.160\nI mean otherwise how are you\ngonna connect to the directory?\n\n485\n00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:03.290\nSo, as long as you have a valid\nuser account, you can connect up.\n\n486\n00:23:03.290 --> 00:23:08.030\nSo that kidding, you don't have to be\nthe administrator to join your computer.\n\n487\n00:23:08.030 --> 00:23:09.890\nYou can't be any person though,\n\n488\n00:23:09.890 --> 00:23:12.650\nyou gotta have valid credentials\nin the directory to do it.\n\n489\n00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:17.080\nAll right, now once that's done,\nI'm now connected.\n\n490\n00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:18.280\nSo, I get this little green light\n\n491\n00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:20.560\nthat let's me know that I'm\nconnected to the directory.\n\n492\n00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:25.370\nAnd when I log out, things aren't\ngonna look too terribly different.\n\n493\n00:23:25.370 --> 00:23:27.190\nBut they're gonna look different enough,\n\n494\n00:23:27.190 --> 00:23:31.760\nbecause when I log out,\nI'll see the little bubbles.\n\n495\n00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:34.600\nAnd now I've gotChristopher Watkin and\nHelpDesk, right?\n\n496\n00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:36.390\nCuz those are the two local accounts.\n\n497\n00:23:36.390 --> 00:23:38.360\nBut I've got this new bubble.\n\n498\n00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:42.380\nIt's easy to spot a Mac that's been\njoined to a directory cuz it'll have\n\n499\n00:23:42.380 --> 00:23:44.000\nother listed.\n\n500\n00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:47.720\nAnd other is saying, hey I'm\nconnected to a directory server and\n\n501\n00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:49.880\nthere might be thousands of user accounts,\n\n502\n00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:52.490\nso I'm not gonna draw a thousand\nbubbles on the screen.\n\n503\n00:23:52.490 --> 00:23:54.290\nSo instead,\nI'm just gonna give you this other.\n\n504\n00:23:54.290 --> 00:23:56.990\nAnd when you click on it\nyou've got to type your name.\n\n505\n00:23:56.990 --> 00:24:01.543\nWe don't normally do that right, the names\nusually pre populated to hear I've got to\n\n506\n00:24:01.543 --> 00:24:05.352\ntype my name and so I could type in\nMike Roderick or Don Pezet or whoever.\n\n507\n00:24:05.352 --> 00:24:09.750\nOn this computer I have Christopher Walken\nand I have helpdesk, and that's it.\n\n508\n00:24:09.750 --> 00:24:11.250\nThere is no Don Pezet account.\n\n509\n00:24:11.250 --> 00:24:16.186\nSo, if I log in Don Pezet and I punch\nin my password from the directory and\n\n510\n00:24:16.186 --> 00:24:17.171\nI go to log in,\n\n511\n00:24:17.171 --> 00:24:23.270\nthat's not gonna work cuz the account\ndoesn't exist here on the computer.\n\n512\n00:24:23.270 --> 00:24:26.891\nBut it exists on the directory server and\nnotice how it's taking a moment,\n\n513\n00:24:26.891 --> 00:24:30.168\nthis is my first log in, the first\nlog in always takes the longest but\n\n514\n00:24:30.168 --> 00:24:32.490\nalso it's having to reach\nacross the network.\n\n515\n00:24:32.490 --> 00:24:34.010\nSorry I left it zoomed in there.\n\n516\n00:24:34.010 --> 00:24:36.950\nIt's gotta reach across the network so\nit took a little\n\n517\n00:24:36.950 --> 00:24:39.750\nlonger to log in because my computer just\nsaid okay I just got this username and\n\n518\n00:24:39.750 --> 00:24:42.620\npassword it doesnt match\nanybody that I have.\n\n519\n00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:44.690\nLet me go talk to this open\ndirectory server and say,\n\n520\n00:24:44.690 --> 00:24:46.470\nhey I got this username and\npassword, is it any good?\n\n521\n00:24:46.470 --> 00:24:49.609\nAnd the directory server said,\nlet me take a look at that.\n\n522\n00:24:49.609 --> 00:24:51.204\nYeah, it's okay, that's good.\n\n523\n00:24:51.204 --> 00:24:56.590\nPassword matches, let them log in, and so\nnow I'm logged in and I'm on the computer.\n\n524\n00:24:56.590 --> 00:24:59.420\nNow if I were to go into my system\n\n525\n00:25:01.730 --> 00:25:07.210\npreferences oops and\ngo into my users and groups.\n\n526\n00:25:07.210 --> 00:25:11.390\nWhen I jump in here,\nnotice how Don Pezet shows up right?\n\n527\n00:25:11.390 --> 00:25:13.270\nI've got a local account now.\n\n528\n00:25:13.270 --> 00:25:13.960\nWell, not really.\n\n529\n00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:16.478\nSee how it says Don Pezet network.\n\n530\n00:25:16.478 --> 00:25:18.230\nThese say standard or admin down here,\n\n531\n00:25:18.230 --> 00:25:20.760\nthese are local accounts\nI'm on the network.\n\n532\n00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:23.911\nWhen I log out, I'll disappear\nfrom this list, I won't show up.\n\n533\n00:25:23.911 --> 00:25:26.652\nI'm not gonna see thousands of\npeople here in this list cuz I'm\n\n534\n00:25:26.652 --> 00:25:27.850\nconnected to a directory.\n\n535\n00:25:29.270 --> 00:25:34.070\nNow in this scenario I connected\nto an open directory server.\n\n536\n00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:35.521\nIt's really not any different for\n\n537\n00:25:35.521 --> 00:25:37.830\nconnecting to\na Microsoft Active Directory, right?\n\n538\n00:25:37.830 --> 00:25:40.590\nOn the Microsoft Active Directory side,\nthough, it is a little more involved.\n\n539\n00:25:40.590 --> 00:25:42.610\nLet me jump over to my other Mac,\nthis one.\n\n540\n00:25:42.610 --> 00:25:43.338\nAll right, so here's my other one.\n\n541\n00:25:43.338 --> 00:25:46.100\nThis one's still not connected\nto a directory server, right?\n\n542\n00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:49.323\nSo join down here is not listing anything.\n\n543\n00:25:49.323 --> 00:25:54.571\nIf I unlock that, there we go I can go and\nI can choose to join.\n\n544\n00:25:54.571 --> 00:25:57.433\nNow Microsoft Active Directory\nservers typically won't be\n\n545\n00:25:57.433 --> 00:25:59.190\nautomatically discovered.\n\n546\n00:25:59.190 --> 00:26:03.125\nSo when I drop this down I saw\na LAB-SERVER01.local which was my\n\n547\n00:26:03.125 --> 00:26:04.608\nopen directory server.\n\n548\n00:26:04.608 --> 00:26:08.450\nI didn't see my Microsoft server\nwhich is actually called LAB-DC01.\n\n549\n00:26:08.450 --> 00:26:10.985\nIt's not showing up in the list, okay.\n\n550\n00:26:10.985 --> 00:26:14.071\nIf I wanna connect to a Microsoft Active\nDirectory server I usually have to\n\n551\n00:26:14.071 --> 00:26:15.190\ntype in a name.\n\n552\n00:26:15.190 --> 00:26:18.054\nAnd when I typed in the name I\nhave to be able to resolve that.\n\n553\n00:26:18.054 --> 00:26:22.080\nAnd when you set up a Microsoft Active\nDirectory server it is pretty common that\n\n554\n00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:24.582\nyou'll have a dedicated\nDNS infrastructure for\n\n555\n00:26:24.582 --> 00:26:26.920\ndoing name resolution\nto be able to find it.\n\n556\n00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:29.900\nSo I need to make sure that\nI'm using the right server for\n\n557\n00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:32.170\nDNS before I even get in here and join it.\n\n558\n00:26:32.170 --> 00:26:34.290\nSo I'm gonna go on to my network.\n\n559\n00:26:34.290 --> 00:26:37.950\nAnd right now I'm using DHCP which\nmeans I'm dynamically getting an IP\n\n560\n00:26:37.950 --> 00:26:38.640\naddress, right?\n\n561\n00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:42.040\nA random IP address\nissued to me by a server.\n\n562\n00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:45.699\nAnd what I need to do is I need\nto override the DNS values.\n\n563\n00:26:45.699 --> 00:26:49.405\nRight now I'm getting a DNS\nserver of 192.168.0.2.\n\n564\n00:26:49.405 --> 00:26:52.460\nI need to make sure I'm using\nmy Active Directory DNS server.\n\n565\n00:26:52.460 --> 00:26:54.840\nSo I'm gonna come in here and\nspecify that.\n\n566\n00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:57.239\nAnd I'm gonna override what DNS is doing.\n\n567\n00:26:58.930 --> 00:27:03.320\nAll right so, I'm overriding what dacp\nis doing, sorry let me say that right.\n\n568\n00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:06.240\nSo now I still have my\nDHCP address up here, but\n\n569\n00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:09.080\nfor DNS I'm using my Microsoft server.\n\n570\n00:27:10.178 --> 00:27:16.188\nAnd from here I can apply that and now I'm\ngonna go back out to my user accounts.\n\n571\n00:27:16.188 --> 00:27:19.918\nAnd my log in options and\nI'm gonna choose to join a directory.\n\n572\n00:27:19.918 --> 00:27:24.328\nAnd because it's not discovering it,\nI'm gonna have to type in\n\n573\n00:27:24.328 --> 00:27:29.074\nthe name of the directory and\nI called my directory lab.itpro.tv.\n\n574\n00:27:29.074 --> 00:27:33.110\nThe apple one was called od.itpro.tv for\nopen directory.\n\n575\n00:27:33.110 --> 00:27:34.040\nThis one I just called lab.\n\n576\n00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:36.850\nThis is my Microsoft Active Directory.\n\n577\n00:27:36.850 --> 00:27:38.640\nAnd when I go to connect.\n\n578\n00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:40.200\nIt's having to ask me for a username and\n\n579\n00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:43.920\npassword because I didn't create\na HelpDesk account on that side.\n\n580\n00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:45.950\nIt doesn't have a matching password,\nso I've got to provide it.\n\n581\n00:27:45.950 --> 00:27:50.973\nSo I'll throw in an account,\nThat I have on that\n\n582\n00:27:50.973 --> 00:27:55.520\nsystem which is just called administrator,\nAnd I'm gonna get logged in.\n\n583\n00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:57.929\nNow, it's asking for a Client Computer ID.\n\n584\n00:27:57.929 --> 00:27:59.547\nWhat's this computer's name?\n\n585\n00:27:59.547 --> 00:28:02.420\nAnd I had named mine labclient02.\n\n586\n00:28:02.420 --> 00:28:05.600\nWhen you first turn on a mac it\nusually gives us a name based on\n\n587\n00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:06.340\nthe name you put in.\n\n588\n00:28:06.340 --> 00:28:08.100\nSo if I created a user\naccount called help desk,\n\n589\n00:28:08.100 --> 00:28:11.070\nit would call this help\ndesk's MacBook Pro.\n\n590\n00:28:11.070 --> 00:28:13.920\nWhich isn't necessarily\nthe greatest computer name.\n\n591\n00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:15.560\nSo here's a chance for us to change it.\n\n592\n00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:17.929\nYou can actually change it\nright here when we join it.\n\n593\n00:28:17.929 --> 00:28:21.270\nAnd it's going to show up in the Active\nDirectory so administrators will see it.\n\n594\n00:28:21.270 --> 00:28:23.650\nYou can give it a name that's\na little more appropriate.\n\n595\n00:28:23.650 --> 00:28:25.110\nI'm gonna go ahead and hit OK.\n\n596\n00:28:25.110 --> 00:28:28.160\nAnd now it's gonna reach out to\nthe Microsoft Active Directory and\n\n597\n00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:29.480\nget us connected.\n\n598\n00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:30.600\nAnd once we're connected,\n\n599\n00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:34.540\nsees us binding to active directory once\nwe're bound, then we'll be able to login\n\n600\n00:28:34.540 --> 00:28:37.770\nwith user accounts that are stored\nin the Microsoft Active Directory.\n\n601\n00:28:37.770 --> 00:28:40.900\nSo even though Microsoft and Apple aren't\nnecessarily the best of friends on most\n\n602\n00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:45.350\ndays, they do work together and here's\none of those chances where we'll see it.\n\n603\n00:28:45.350 --> 00:28:46.420\nNow it's taking a moment.\n\n604\n00:28:46.420 --> 00:28:49.400\nIt seems kinda like it's doing, but down\nhere I can see my green light just lit up,\n\n605\n00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:53.610\nso it is actually going through the\nprocess of sending our client data over to\n\n606\n00:28:53.610 --> 00:28:57.060\nthe Active Directory put in there and\nfeeding it back.\n\n607\n00:28:57.060 --> 00:29:01.420\nAnd when it's done, there we go,\nnow I'm connected to that lab network.\n\n608\n00:29:01.420 --> 00:29:06.588\nAnd notice how I typed lab.itprotv,\nthe new FQDN?\n\n609\n00:29:06.588 --> 00:29:11.409\nBut what's showing up is just plain\nold lab which is the old way, right.\n\n610\n00:29:11.409 --> 00:29:13.720\nSo the Apple side is kinda seeing both.\n\n611\n00:29:14.790 --> 00:29:16.919\nSo in other words Joy we\ncan just log right out.\n\n612\n00:29:16.919 --> 00:29:20.410\nAnd well hopefully login with one of\nour Active Directory accounts right.\n\n613\n00:29:20.410 --> 00:29:22.830\nSo this is gonna look just\nlike the open directory.\n\n614\n00:29:22.830 --> 00:29:25.628\nWhen I come out here I'll have that\nother bubble that we saw before.\n\n615\n00:29:25.628 --> 00:29:28.443\nAnd when I click on other I'll have\nthe opportunity to type in a name and\n\n616\n00:29:28.443 --> 00:29:28.980\na password.\n\n617\n00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:31.550\nSo I can just punch in\nwhatever that is going to be.\n\n618\n00:29:31.550 --> 00:29:36.929\nSo I have a user account in the Active\nDirectory which it oops I talk too long so\n\n619\n00:29:36.929 --> 00:29:39.260\nwhy don't I so type in.\n\n620\n00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:42.850\nAnd I can log in with the new style name\nthe fully qualified name which in my case\n\n621\n00:29:42.850 --> 00:29:50.170\nbe dpzet@lab.itpro.tv or I can log in as\nlab/dpzet which is the old sound name.\n\n622\n00:29:50.170 --> 00:29:54.640\nEither one will work and\nI'll punch in whatever my password is.\n\n623\n00:29:56.100 --> 00:29:58.849\nAnd it's gonna think for a second right.\n\n624\n00:29:58.849 --> 00:30:00.932\nRemember it hands off\nover to the network and\n\n625\n00:30:00.932 --> 00:30:04.040\nthen as soon as it gets that response\nback, then we get logged in.\n\n626\n00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:07.478\nAnd once I'm logged in,\nnow I'm up and running.\n\n627\n00:30:07.478 --> 00:30:09.479\nAgain just like a connection\nto open directory here,\n\n628\n00:30:09.479 --> 00:30:12.730\nit's just Microsoft's Active Directory,\nand I'm working with a network account.\n\n629\n00:30:12.730 --> 00:30:18.530\nIf I go into my System Preferences and\nMy User Accounts when I go in here\n\n630\n00:30:18.530 --> 00:30:23.760\nI'll see that I show up in a little bit of\nscreen glitch there cuz I have no name.\n\n631\n00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:25.530\nBut, [LAUGH] Show up there with your name.\n\n632\n00:30:25.530 --> 00:30:29.260\nAnd you'll see that your logged\nin with that network account.\n\n633\n00:30:29.260 --> 00:30:30.821\nAnd see online it says Managed.\n\n634\n00:30:30.821 --> 00:30:33.640\nThat means it's a managed security\npolicy that's being applied to me\n\n635\n00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:36.670\nfrom a network server that's\nnot Microsoft Active Directory.\n\n636\n00:30:36.670 --> 00:30:38.870\nThat's really the main reason\nwhy Active Directory is so\n\n637\n00:30:38.870 --> 00:30:42.970\npopular is hey, as far as logging in,\nas far as using a password,\n\n638\n00:30:42.970 --> 00:30:47.140\nApple's Open Directory is just as\nrobust as Microsoft's Active Directory.\n\n639\n00:30:47.140 --> 00:30:51.270\nBut beyond that, the managed security\npolicies, group policy objects,\n\n640\n00:30:51.270 --> 00:30:54.350\npassword policies, all those things, are\nthings that Microsoft's Active Directory\n\n641\n00:30:54.350 --> 00:30:56.770\ndoes really well, that manged piece.\n\n642\n00:30:56.770 --> 00:30:59.260\nAnd so we lose that when we do\njust an Apple Open Directory.\n\n643\n00:30:59.260 --> 00:31:01.780\nThat's why there product\nis not as popular.\n\n644\n00:31:01.780 --> 00:31:04.737\nAnd if you ever ask yourself\nwhy don't they change that?\n\n645\n00:31:04.737 --> 00:31:07.950\nWell it's one of those areas where Apple\nfocuses mostly on the consumer, and\n\n646\n00:31:07.950 --> 00:31:11.164\non small businesses, where you wouldn't\nnecessarily have a directory, so\n\n647\n00:31:11.164 --> 00:31:12.513\nit's just not a high priority.\n\n648\n00:31:12.513 --> 00:31:16.119\nThere's many other things that\nthey get prioritized over that.\n\n649\n00:31:16.119 --> 00:31:18.147\n&gt;&gt; Now Don is there any way\nthat I could join both,\n\n650\n00:31:18.147 --> 00:31:21.300\nis there any reason I would wanna\njoin both with a single machine?\n\n651\n00:31:21.300 --> 00:31:23.925\n&gt;&gt; There's plenty of reason to want to,\nbut you can't do it.\n\n652\n00:31:23.925 --> 00:31:27.018\n[LAUGH] What happens\nis if I go in here and\n\n653\n00:31:27.018 --> 00:31:31.308\nI go into my user accounts, and\nlog in options and I go to rejoin,\n\n654\n00:31:31.308 --> 00:31:36.450\nnotice how I don't have a Join button\nanymore I just have Edit, right?\n\n655\n00:31:36.450 --> 00:31:38.180\nI can edit who I'm connected to.\n\n656\n00:31:38.180 --> 00:31:40.740\nSo I could switch from one to the other,\nbut\n\n657\n00:31:40.740 --> 00:31:43.480\nI couldn't be connected\nto both at the same time.\n\n658\n00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:45.500\nSo you gotta pick one.\n\n659\n00:31:45.500 --> 00:31:48.240\nLike I said at the beginning of\nthe episode, pick one and stick with it.\n\n660\n00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:49.740\nThat's gonna give you\nthe best environment.\n\n661\n00:31:49.740 --> 00:31:53.060\n&gt;&gt; And like you said, mostly like,\nit's whatever we're running at work and\n\n662\n00:31:53.060 --> 00:31:54.360\nI just have to join to that one.\n\n663\n00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:54.941\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah and\n\n664\n00:31:54.941 --> 00:31:57.441\nat home you're not normally gonna\nhave a directory service like this.\n\n665\n00:31:57.441 --> 00:32:00.130\nBut if you do, you would specify that.\n\n666\n00:32:00.130 --> 00:32:02.750\nIf you have a laptop that went back and\nforth between work and home,\n\n667\n00:32:02.750 --> 00:32:04.740\nnow you've got a challenge.\n\n668\n00:32:04.740 --> 00:32:09.390\nBecause it doesn't really allow you to\nbe connected to more than one directory\n\n669\n00:32:09.390 --> 00:32:10.028\nservice.\n\n670\n00:32:10.028 --> 00:32:13.320\n&gt;&gt; All right Don, fantastic look\nthere at directory services.\n\n671\n00:32:13.320 --> 00:32:16.950\nWe've talked about Integrating our\nMac into our workplace or wherever.\n\n672\n00:32:16.950 --> 00:32:20.850\nAnd working with either with Active\nDirectory, if we got a Microsoft solution\n\n673\n00:32:20.850 --> 00:32:23.820\nor that open directory if\nwe've got a Mac solution.\n\n674\n00:32:23.820 --> 00:32:25.152\nBut, we thank you for that and\n\n675\n00:32:25.152 --> 00:32:27.562\nhope everybody out there\nenjoyed watching this one.\n\n676\n00:32:27.562 --> 00:32:30.870\nSigning for ITProTv,\nI've been your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n677\n00:32:30.870 --> 00:32:31.450\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Don Pozet.\n\n678\n00:32:31.450 --> 00:32:33.241\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time\n\n679\n00:32:33.241 --> 00:32:39.210\n[MUSIC]\n\n680\n00:32:39.210 -->

00:00:08.522\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.522 --> 00:00:11.204\n&gt;&gt; Your watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.204 --> 00:00:15.974\n&gt;&gt; Hello, welcome to another\nexciting episode here at ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.974 --> 00:00:20.130\nI am your host, Mike Rodrick and today,\nwe are doing our Mac integration basics.\n\n7\n00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.310\nAnd specifically in this episode,\n\n8\n00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:23.890\nwe are gonna be taking a look\nat file sharing, right?\n\n9\n00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:27.700\nIn a previous episode, we had talked\nabout directory services, and\n\n10\n00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.802\ngetting our MacBook joined\nto different directories.\n\n11\n00:00:30.802 --> 00:00:33.458\nNow that we're part of the network,\nmaybe we wanna take a look and\n\n12\n00:00:33.458 --> 00:00:34.920\nsee what file shares are out there.\n\n13\n00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.937\nWe needed to know how to connect to those,\n\n14\n00:00:36.937 --> 00:00:40.560\nand here to help us with that is\nMr Don Pezet, welcome back, Don.\n\n15\n00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:41.566\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for having me, Mike,\n\n16\n00:00:41.566 --> 00:00:43.997\ngetting ready to begin our journey in\nto the land of share a lot, right?\n\n17\n00:00:43.997 --> 00:00:48.010\n[LAUGH] So, we're gonna get in here and\nsee how we can exchange files and\n\n18\n00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.818\nother content in between\ndifferent computers.\n\n19\n00:00:50.818 --> 00:00:57.020\nNow, when you're dealing with Macs,\nI've got a MacBook, if Mike has a MacBook,\n\n20\n00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.150\nsuper easy to share files in between us,\nnot really a big deal.\n\n21\n00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:02.988\nWhere it becomes a challenge\nthough is on the network.\n\n22\n00:01:02.988 --> 00:01:06.743\nThere are so many different operating\nsystems that are out there, so\n\n23\n00:01:06.743 --> 00:01:11.081\nmany different ways to store and share\nfiles and folders that it's not as cut and\n\n24\n00:01:11.081 --> 00:01:14.836\ndry as just, hey, the two systems\nautomatically find each other and\n\n25\n00:01:14.836 --> 00:01:16.030\nthere you go.\n\n26\n00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.470\nSo, when it comes to Mac integration,\nright,\n\n27\n00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:20.700\nwe're integrating with other\nsystems that are out there,\n\n28\n00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.340\nwe need to be able to talk to\nthese different types of systems.\n\n29\n00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.540\nAnd fortunately, Apple has taken\ncare of a lot of that for us.\n\n30\n00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.430\nYou'll find that your Mac is able to\ntalk to any number of different services\n\n31\n00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.970\nthat are out there, that make it where\nyou should be able to exchange files with\n\n32\n00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.750\npretty much any other operating\nsystem that you encounter.\n\n33\n00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.580\nNow there's a handful of standard\nprotocols that are used for\n\n34\n00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.690\ncommunicating across the network and\nsome of them happen automatically.\n\n35\n00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.810\nYou don't even know it,\nyou just browse and that's that.\n\n36\n00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.900\nOthers have to get a little\nbit more involved, right?\n\n37\n00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.128\nIf you happen to be working\nin an all Apple environment,\n\n38\n00:01:55.128 --> 00:02:00.457\nthen your MacBooks, your iMacs,\nyour Mac minis, all your MacOS devices,\n\n39\n00:02:00.457 --> 00:02:04.210\nand even your iOS devices are using\na protocol called Bonjour.\n\n40\n00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:06.230\nAnd Bonjour lets them find each other.\n\n41\n00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:07.420\nThey see each other on the network.\n\n42\n00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:08.620\nThey exchange information and\n\n43\n00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:13.390\nthey use that protocol to make it super\neasy to see what's out there, right?\n\n44\n00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.280\nAnd then, they can connect to the file\nshares and start to exchange files or\n\n45\n00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.088\nconnect to a printer or whatever.\n\n46\n00:02:19.088 --> 00:02:23.443\nAnd once they start to do that, they're\nactually flipping to another protocol\n\n47\n00:02:23.443 --> 00:02:26.650\na protocol called AFP,\nor Apple File Protocol.\n\n48\n00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.900\nAnd AFP is like the name implies,\n\n49\n00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.360\ndeveloped by Apple for\nexchanging files between systems.\n\n50\n00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.180\nAnd, print jobs really are just\nfile exchanges, right?\n\n51\n00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.334\nI take a print job, we turn it into\na graphics file, which is just a file and\n\n52\n00:02:39.334 --> 00:02:42.818\nwe transmit it over the network\nto a printer or other device and\n\n53\n00:02:42.818 --> 00:02:45.170\nthey take that file and they print it out.\n\n54\n00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.090\nSo it really is a file transfer even\nthough it's going to a printer.\n\n55\n00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.210\nThat technology is all kind of seamless,\nit's in the background,\n\n56\n00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:55.220\nwe don't even notice it,\nyou don't even really get aware of it.\n\n57\n00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.257\nLike, most Mac users have\nnever even heard of AFP, and\n\n58\n00:02:57.257 --> 00:02:59.484\nthey really shouldn't have\nthey don't need to know that.\n\n59\n00:02:59.484 --> 00:03:01.857\nAnd they may not have heard\nof Bonjour either and again,\n\n60\n00:03:01.857 --> 00:03:04.860\nthey shouldn't have it to,\nit should be automatic.\n\n61\n00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.290\nBut when you're connecting to Windows\nsystems, or if you're connecting to\n\n62\n00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.710\nLinux systems, it's not like that,\nthey don't run Bonjour by default.\n\n63\n00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:15.590\nAlthough there are versions of Bonjour\nthat you can put on those to make it where\n\n64\n00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:17.730\nyou can discover them,\nthey don't have it by default.\n\n65\n00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.900\nSo, we're not gonna find\nWindows machines automatically.\n\n66\n00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.720\nAnd even if we did, Windows and\nLinux use different protocols for\n\n67\n00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.870\nexchanging files, right?\n\n68\n00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:32.380\nIt doesn't mean we can't talk to them,\nit's just not automatic anymore, right?\n\n69\n00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:34.420\nLet's take a quick look at what\nthe automatic piece looks like.\n\n70\n00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.980\nSo here I am on a macOS Sierra machine.\n\n71\n00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.831\nAnd, this is a stock install, I haven't\nreally messed with it too much and\n\n72\n00:03:41.831 --> 00:03:46.228\nwhen I fire up my finder,\nit's gonna show me, well, all my files.\n\n73\n00:03:46.228 --> 00:03:47.589\nThis is a new machine, so\nI don't have any files.\n\n74\n00:03:47.589 --> 00:03:48.910\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So that's blank.\n\n75\n00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:52.150\nBut, you can look at your Documents,\nand your Downloads, your Desktop,\n\n76\n00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.840\nall these things.\n\n77\n00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.642\nThese are files that are right\nhere on your own machine, right?\n\n78\n00:03:55.642 --> 00:03:59.048\nAnd if you choose your Devices, so\nhere I'm looking at my hard drive,\n\n79\n00:03:59.048 --> 00:04:02.630\nmy Macintosh HD is what it actually says,\nthere we go, right?\n\n80\n00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:07.480\nBut, if I keep scrolling down,\nI get to the Shared section, okay,\n\n81\n00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:08.740\nand what is that?\n\n82\n00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:12.910\nWell now, we're seeing devices\non the network, all right.\n\n83\n00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:14.770\nAnd your not seeing all\nthe devices your seeing a subset.\n\n84\n00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:17.060\nThese are usually the devices\nthat are found first.\n\n85\n00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.770\nSo Cameron's Macbook Pro, that's one\nof our developers across the building.\n\n86\n00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:22.240\nI'm seeing his MacBook.\n\n87\n00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.820\nDon's MacBook Pro, that's the machine\nI'm actually on right now.\n\n88\n00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:27.360\nEditing Station, Editing Station 2,\n\n89\n00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:31.750\nthat's our editors over there,\nright, it's finding these machines.\n\n90\n00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:35.660\nNow, there's a nice little consistent\npattern across all of these.\n\n91\n00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:38.370\nEvery one of these that we're seeing,\nactually not every one,\n\n92\n00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:41.460\nalmost every one is a Mac, right?\n\n93\n00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:44.108\nCameron's machine, my machine,\nthe Editing stations, those are all Macs.\n\n94\n00:04:44.108 --> 00:04:45.965\nlab-server02, that's a Mac.\n\n95\n00:04:45.965 --> 00:04:50.230\nLAB-SERVER01, it's got a question mark,\nit doesn't know what that is, right?\n\n96\n00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:52.490\nWell, I actually messed with\nLAB-SERVER01 a good bit.\n\n97\n00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:53.840\nSo it's a Windows machine now, but\n\n98\n00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.910\nit was a Mac before, and so\nit's probably cached that.\n\n99\n00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:01.140\nMac Mini Studio 2, I'm assuming\nis a Mac Mini over in Studio 2.\n\n100\n00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:02.840\nI haven't been over there recently,\nso I don't know.\n\n101\n00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:07.100\nBut, it found Macs, and when I go to All,\n\n102\n00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:10.340\nnow it's gonna look a little more and\nsee what it can find out there.\n\n103\n00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:13.800\nAnd, there's a few more things that\nare showing up, Ronnie's MacBook Pro,\n\n104\n00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:18.220\nProductron's Encoding Mac,\nTim's iMac 27, all these other systems.\n\n105\n00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:19.520\n&gt;&gt; Still all Macs there, Don.\n\n106\n00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:23.154\n&gt;&gt; Still all Macs, and actually though,\nif I look at lab-server02,\n\n107\n00:05:23.154 --> 00:05:27.420\nnow I'm questioning because over here,\nit had the little computer screen icon.\n\n108\n00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:30.993\nIt's a little insider joke with Apple\nthat when they detect a Windows machine,\n\n109\n00:05:30.993 --> 00:05:34.190\nthey show a monitor that has the blue\nscreen of death from Windows on it,\n\n110\n00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:36.190\nwhich is what Windows\ndoes when it crashes.\n\n111\n00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:39.000\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, that's their little joke.\n\n112\n00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.570\nAnd it's an old style CRT also, anyhow.\n\n113\n00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:43.980\n&gt;&gt; One little dig.\n\n114\n00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:48.378\n&gt;&gt; So lab-server02, now I'm curious,\nwhat is lab-server02?\n\n115\n00:05:48.378 --> 00:05:50.312\nLab-server02, actually doesn't exist,\n\n116\n00:05:50.312 --> 00:05:52.790\nI don't know,\nlab-server02 now I'm really confused.\n\n117\n00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:57.414\nSo, but it found it on the network,\neither way, it's finding this machines and\n\n118\n00:05:57.414 --> 00:06:01.850\nhopefully I can browse them and\naccess files and folders, right?\n\n119\n00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:04.198\nBut, when it comes to\nconnecting to other protocols,\n\n120\n00:06:04.198 --> 00:06:07.174\nwe're not normally gonna be able\nto take advantage of this, right?\n\n121\n00:06:07.174 --> 00:06:10.195\nI'll show you how to get this part\nset up a little bit later, but\n\n122\n00:06:10.195 --> 00:06:14.244\nit doesn't necessarily help us, we're\nconnecting to another operating system.\n\n123\n00:06:14.244 --> 00:06:16.247\nWhen your connecting to\nanother operating system,\n\n124\n00:06:16.247 --> 00:06:19.120\nyou will typically have to tell\nthe Mac how to get there, right?\n\n125\n00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:22.110\nIn my finder,\nI don't have a ton of options here for\n\n126\n00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:23.790\nconnecting to other systems.\n\n127\n00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:28.667\nBut, up top in my menus up here, you\nsee the Go menu and we could choose Go,\n\n128\n00:06:28.667 --> 00:06:32.162\nand right down here,\nyou have, Connect to server.\n\n129\n00:06:32.162 --> 00:06:33.320\nAnd this is what we can use for\n\n130\n00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:36.500\nconnecting to systems that\nweren't automatically discovered.\n\n131\n00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:40.340\nWhen you chose Connect to Server, you get\nthis little dialogue box that pops up\n\n132\n00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:42.860\nthat'll let you type in a Server Address,\nright?\n\n133\n00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:47.000\nNow, you can choose Browse, and browse\nwill let you browse the network to try to\n\n134\n00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.250\nfind things, but, we just saw how\neffective that was on my system.\n\n135\n00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:50.760\nI know for\n\n136\n00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:54.160\na fact there's at least one Windows server\nout there that didn't get detected.\n\n137\n00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:56.570\nSo, there's systems that it's not finding.\n\n138\n00:06:56.570 --> 00:07:02.910\nSo, Browse works sometimes, but\nit's not perfect, Server Address, though.\n\n139\n00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:06.610\nI can manually type in the address of\na server that I wanna connect to, and\n\n140\n00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:07.830\nI can get there.\n\n141\n00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:08.867\nNow when I, go ahead.\n\n142\n00:07:08.867 --> 00:07:10.436\n&gt;&gt; And Don, when this says server,\n\n143\n00:07:10.436 --> 00:07:14.023\nwhat if my buddy has a MacBook that he\nshared something with, is this only for\n\n144\n00:07:14.023 --> 00:07:16.485\nconnecting to servers or\nother machines as well?\n\n145\n00:07:16.485 --> 00:07:17.935\n&gt;&gt; It could really be anything, right?\n\n146\n00:07:17.935 --> 00:07:21.005\nBecause the way a server shares files is\nnot really any different than the way\n\n147\n00:07:21.005 --> 00:07:21.885\na workstation shares files.\n\n148\n00:07:21.885 --> 00:07:24.355\nThe only thing that's really different\nis how we authenticate, right?\n\n149\n00:07:24.355 --> 00:07:27.315\nWorkstations normally have\ntheir own unique user database.\n\n150\n00:07:27.315 --> 00:07:29.055\nServers are typically\na part of a directory but\n\n151\n00:07:29.055 --> 00:07:31.520\nthey might have their own unique\ndatabase too, it just depends.\n\n152\n00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:34.035\nAt this point,\nwhen we connect to a network share,\n\n153\n00:07:34.035 --> 00:07:37.030\nwe don't really know if it's a server or\na workstation.\n\n154\n00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:39.060\nIt could be either one, all right?\n\n155\n00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:41.264\nThe other thing is,\nthere's more than one protocol out there.\n\n156\n00:07:41.264 --> 00:07:43.602\nSo when we specify a server here,\n\n157\n00:07:43.602 --> 00:07:48.876\nwhat we actually need to specify is at\na minimum two pieces of information.\n\n158\n00:07:48.876 --> 00:07:54.470\nA protocol, and then the user will be\nlike, ://, and then a server name, right?\n\n159\n00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:58.627\nThose are the two pieces of information\nit needs to connect to a server.\n\n160\n00:07:58.627 --> 00:08:02.100\nYou might also be able to pass a user\nname and a password in this URL.\n\n161\n00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:06.020\nAnd the way that looks\nis you'll see where it's\n\n162\n00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:11.220\na username:password@ and\nthe servername like that.\n\n163\n00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:14.560\nRight starting to get a little\nmore complex on that line.\n\n164\n00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:18.120\nWe don't normally do that, because if\nit requires a username and a password\n\n165\n00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:21.540\nthen when you browse through it through\na prompt, the username and the password.\n\n166\n00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:23.120\nThe other thing is if you\never put the username and\n\n167\n00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:26.160\npassword right here in line with the URL,\nit sent unencrypted over the network.\n\n168\n00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:27.930\nAnd that's not a great thing either.\n\n169\n00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:30.080\nWe'd rather wait and\nlet it prompt us and then, hopefully,\n\n170\n00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:32.010\nwe'll have a secured session from there.\n\n171\n00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:34.510\nBut, these are the two pieces of\ninformation I need to provide.\n\n172\n00:08:34.510 --> 00:08:35.880\nA protocol and a server name.\n\n173\n00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:37.440\nSo let's start with protocol.\n\n174\n00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:39.610\nThe protocol can be any number of things.\n\n175\n00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:43.890\nI mentioned with Apple we normally\nuse AFP, Apple file protocol.\n\n176\n00:08:43.890 --> 00:08:45.920\nSo if you're connecting to another\nApple device, you can use it.\n\n177\n00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:49.040\nBut if you're connecting with another\nApple device you probably would have just\n\n178\n00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:50.730\nused browse because\nyou'll find it that way.\n\n179\n00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:52.350\nUnless it's on a different network, right?\n\n180\n00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:54.740\nMaybe you're reaching through\na router to a different subnet and\n\n181\n00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:57.840\nBonjour doesn't work in\nbetween subnets like that.\n\n182\n00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:01.440\nSo we have to manually specify\nthe DNS name or the IP address.\n\n183\n00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:06.610\nSo the system that we're connecting to and\nthen the protocol.\n\n184\n00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:10.080\nOther protocols that are support though.\n\n185\n00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:13.210\nIf I'm connecting to Linux or Unix server,\n\n186\n00:09:13.210 --> 00:09:19.200\nremember that Maco S is running Unix under\nhood, so BST environment under the hood.\n\n187\n00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:22.810\nSo it can connect those using NFS,\nthe Network File System.\n\n188\n00:09:22.810 --> 00:09:26.780\nNFS has been around a long time,\nsince the 1980s.\n\n189\n00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:30.210\nIt's supported by every Linux and\nUnix distribution that's out there and\n\n190\n00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:31.300\nevery BSD.\n\n191\n00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:36.060\nSo if you're connecting to any Linux\ndistro, Free BSD, Open BSD, those guys,\n\n192\n00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:39.060\nSolaris, any of those\nother Unix like systems,\n\n193\n00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:40.400\nyou can use NFS to connect to them.\n\n194\n00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:42.550\nAnd there's even NFS servers for\nWindows too.\n\n195\n00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:45.300\nSo NFS is the one that you\ncan kind of get working on\n\n196\n00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:46.630\nevery operating system if you need to.\n\n197\n00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:51.530\nThere's FTP,\nFTP's been around a long time also.\n\n198\n00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:53.750\nFile Transfer Protocol.\n\n199\n00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:56.760\nFTP is nice in that everybody supports it,\nbut\n\n200\n00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:59.650\nit's not nice in that it's\ncompletely unencrypted,\n\n201\n00:09:59.650 --> 00:10:02.520\neven the user name and password are\ntransmitted across the network insecurely.\n\n202\n00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:04.450\nSo it's not perfect by any means.\n\n203\n00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:09.680\nBut it is something that is still\nsupported, because if you're\n\n204\n00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:14.980\njust doing non sensitive transfers, FTP\nis quick and easy to get up and running.\n\n205\n00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:19.160\nThen we've got things like HTTP,\nright, if you were browsing the web,\n\n206\n00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:22.810\nnow, I'm not browsing the web, if I was,\nI'd usually fire up Safari, or Chrome, or\n\n207\n00:10:22.810 --> 00:10:24.210\nsomething like that, and\nbrowse to it that way, so\n\n208\n00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:28.950\nwe wouldn't normally do it here but\nthere is a service called WebDAV.\n\n209\n00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:33.220\nWebDAV is web distributed authoring and\nversioning.\n\n210\n00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:36.360\nAnd what it allows you to do is to\nconnect to a file server using HTTP.\n\n211\n00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:39.320\nAnd this was popular in\nthe early days of the Internet\n\n212\n00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:42.300\nwhere you had web developers that\nwanted to connect to a web server and\n\n213\n00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:45.720\nbe able to edit the HTML files and\nthings like it was a file system.\n\n214\n00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:48.170\nAnd so they would connect to\na WebDAV server this way,\n\n215\n00:10:48.170 --> 00:10:52.710\nand you'd have to provide authentication\nin the connection string here.\n\n216\n00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:55.090\nSo it wasn't the greatest protocol.\n\n217\n00:10:55.090 --> 00:10:57.540\nSSL helped with that a good bit,\nbut by and large,\n\n218\n00:10:57.540 --> 00:10:59.400\nmost people have moved away from WebDAV.\n\n219\n00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:03.390\nLet's see, what else do we have\nas far as other protocols?\n\n220\n00:11:03.390 --> 00:11:04.700\nI think those are the main ones.\n\n221\n00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:06.860\nThe one I haven't mentioned is\nthe most important one though,\n\n222\n00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:11.370\nthe one we really need to know for\nthe exam, and that is SMB.\n\n223\n00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:14.520\nSMB, it stands for Server Message Block.\n\n224\n00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:19.090\nAnd this is the file protocol used\nby Microsoft Windows machines.\n\n225\n00:11:19.090 --> 00:11:22.645\nIf you have Windows file shares in your\nnetwork that you want to connect too.\n\n226\n00:11:22.645 --> 00:11:25.315\nThen you're gonna connect\nto them using SMB.\n\n227\n00:11:25.315 --> 00:11:28.125\nSo it'll be smb:// and\nthen the name of the server.\n\n228\n00:11:28.125 --> 00:11:30.675\nAnd we specify who it is that\nwe're gonna connect to, right?\n\n229\n00:11:30.675 --> 00:11:36.155\nSo for example if I wanted to do,\nlet's start with FTP cuz that one's easy.\n\n230\n00:11:36.155 --> 00:11:39.495\nIf I would say FTP I would say ftp:// and\nthen the server I wanted to connect to.\n\n231\n00:11:39.495 --> 00:11:43.393\nI brought a quick server\nup at 192.168.0.10.\n\n232\n00:11:43.393 --> 00:11:47.910\nI'm typing in the IP,\nyou can do DNS domain names also,\n\n233\n00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:50.450\nthat usually makes it a little\nbit easier on your users.\n\n234\n00:11:50.450 --> 00:11:52.490\nBut, I'm going to point there.\n\n235\n00:11:52.490 --> 00:11:58.110\nNow, when I go to connect, it's going\nto ask me how I want to login, right?\n\n236\n00:11:58.110 --> 00:12:02.460\nNow, guest is an option that lets me login\nwithout a username and a password, and\n\n237\n00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:05.500\nthat works when you're logging\ninto macs and Windows machines.\n\n238\n00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:09.020\nBut with FTP, it doesn't actually\nhave a true guest function, instead,\n\n239\n00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:11.930\nit has a user account called anonymous,\nand so\n\n240\n00:12:11.930 --> 00:12:15.860\nI need to specify it that way, so\nI'm gonna log in as this anonymous user.\n\n241\n00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:19.800\nAnd when I connect,\nit's gonna reach out and there we go,\n\n242\n00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:24.110\nI'm now connected to this FTP server, and\nsee how it shows up under Shared now?\n\n243\n00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:28.250\nIt shows up, as if it was automatically\ndeleted, it wasn't, I had to tell it, but\n\n244\n00:12:28.250 --> 00:12:28.870\nit shows up there.\n\n245\n00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:31.400\nAnd it's even got a nice little\neject button which means\n\n246\n00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:35.850\nit's gonna stay here for the rest of\nthe time that I'm logged in, right?\n\n247\n00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:39.540\nAnd in your finder options you might've\nchosen to have it show network options on\n\n248\n00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:42.540\nyour desktop and the little icon will\nstay right there on your desktop.\n\n249\n00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:44.040\nI don't have that turned on,\n\n250\n00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:47.360\nand actually I don't know if I\nremember where that option is here.\n\n251\n00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:50.860\nSo I just went up to my Finder and\nPreferences.\n\n252\n00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:53.810\nAnd then right in here you've got the\noption to say show connected servers on\n\n253\n00:12:53.810 --> 00:12:54.940\nthe desktop.\n\n254\n00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:56.920\nAnd when I do that there we go.\n\n255\n00:12:56.920 --> 00:13:01.360\nNow I get a nice little icon right\nhere for anonymous at 192.168.0.10,\n\n256\n00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:05.420\ndoesn't really roll off the tongue,\nbut there's the files.\n\n257\n00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:09.180\nIf I need access to that network share,\nI can jump right over to it.\n\n258\n00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:13.410\nAnd when I get there,\nI can open up this amazing text file,\n\n259\n00:13:13.410 --> 00:13:16.300\nthere it is in a microscopic\nfont that I can't read.\n\n260\n00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:18.050\nThere we go, this is a shared file.\n\n261\n00:13:18.050 --> 00:13:20.890\nAnd now I know because I was able\nto access it via the network.\n\n262\n00:13:20.890 --> 00:13:22.510\nBut that's just FTP.\n\n263\n00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:26.390\nAnd the reality is we don't see\nFTP used that much anymore.\n\n264\n00:13:26.390 --> 00:13:28.890\nFor quick and dirty access though,\nthat's it, right?\n\n265\n00:13:28.890 --> 00:13:29.670\nWe've got it.\n\n266\n00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:32.770\nBut, if we really want to\nparticipate in a corporate network,\n\n267\n00:13:32.770 --> 00:13:36.910\nwe're normally going to see SMB, Server\nMessage Block, the Windows Fileshare.\n\n268\n00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:39.760\n&gt;&gt; Now Don, before we move off of FTP,\nthere was a good question in the chatroom.\n\n269\n00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:41.560\nDoes Apple support secure FTP?\n\n270\n00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:46.740\n&gt;&gt; They do from the command line,\nnot from the GUI.\n\n271\n00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:49.260\nSo in the GUI side we've\ngotta do it here as FTP.\n\n272\n00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:52.550\nIf you wanna do it from anything else\nyou'd have to drop to the command line and\n\n273\n00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:54.390\ndo it, so\nit makes it a little bit trickier.\n\n274\n00:13:54.390 --> 00:13:59.600\nOr you can set up an SSH tunnel first,\nand then do FTP right on top of it.\n\n275\n00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:01.200\nWhich is all SFTP is, right.\n\n276\n00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:04.530\nSFTP is regular FTP with\nan SSH tunnel built up.\n\n277\n00:14:04.530 --> 00:14:07.950\nSo that's one way you can kind of cheat\nand do it where it still works in the GUI.\n\n278\n00:14:07.950 --> 00:14:10.270\nBut for the most part you've\ngotta drop to command line.\n\n279\n00:14:10.270 --> 00:14:11.420\n&gt;&gt; Okay, very good.\n\n280\n00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:13.160\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and always remember that,\n\n281\n00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:16.900\nthat in the GUI Apple tries to keep\nthings simple and easy, right?\n\n282\n00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:20.680\nBut you can always drop to a terminal and\nit's straight up BSD.\n\n283\n00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:24.170\nAnything that you can do on a Unix server\nyou can do right from the command line,\n\n284\n00:14:24.170 --> 00:14:26.750\nso you've got that access on the system.\n\n285\n00:14:28.010 --> 00:14:28.700\nAll right.\n\n286\n00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:30.080\nLet's talk about Windows.\n\n287\n00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:33.850\nThat server that I just connected to,\n192.168.0.10.\n\n288\n00:14:33.850 --> 00:14:36.820\nIt's an FTP server, but\nit's also a Windows server.\n\n289\n00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:42.130\nAnd it's got that same exact folder shared\nout using SMB, using server message block.\n\n290\n00:14:42.130 --> 00:14:43.980\nAnd that's how our clients\nwould normally connect.\n\n291\n00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:46.420\nOur Windows machines will\nautomatically find it and connect.\n\n292\n00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:50.030\nBut on a Mac, I just need to\ntell it what I wanna connect to.\n\n293\n00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:51.990\nNow, this connection can\nbe a little bit different.\n\n294\n00:14:51.990 --> 00:14:53.210\nI'm gonna go back to my machine here.\n\n295\n00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:56.280\nI'm gonna use that go menu,\nand hit Connect to Server.\n\n296\n00:14:56.280 --> 00:15:00.260\nWhich I normally hit Cmd+K,\nthat's the keyboard shortcut for that.\n\n297\n00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:04.040\nI'm not exactly sure where K\nfits into that as the shortcut.\n\n298\n00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:05.650\nBut anyhow it's Cmd+K\nis what I normally hit.\n\n299\n00:15:05.650 --> 00:15:09.530\nAnd we're gonna connect to a server and\nwhen I connect to it,\n\n300\n00:15:09.530 --> 00:15:14.590\nit's the same server name, but instead\nof FTP, I'm just gonna change it to SMB.\n\n301\n00:15:15.610 --> 00:15:19.490\nAll right, now,\nif I just connect this way,\n\n302\n00:15:19.490 --> 00:15:22.410\nthere might be more than\none folder on that server.\n\n303\n00:15:22.410 --> 00:15:25.150\nAnd I might have different\npermissions on different folders.\n\n304\n00:15:25.150 --> 00:15:29.410\nIf I just connect straight up to\nthe server I'm gonna authenticate and\n\n305\n00:15:29.410 --> 00:15:32.380\nit'll show me the folders\nthat I'm allowed to see.\n\n306\n00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:34.990\nIf I wanted to do different credentials\nfor different folders though,\n\n307\n00:15:34.990 --> 00:15:38.030\nI would actually need to extend\nthis line out a little more and\n\n308\n00:15:38.030 --> 00:15:41.490\nadd which folder it is I wanted\nto connect to, all right?\n\n309\n00:15:41.490 --> 00:15:45.800\nBut if you're anything like me I can\nnever remember the name of the folders.\n\n310\n00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:48.120\nAnd so I usually just leave that off.\n\n311\n00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:52.839\nAnd so I'm gonna connect via SMB2,\n192.168.0.10.\n\n312\n00:15:52.839 --> 00:15:55.810\nAnd when I hit connect,\nit's gonna reach out the server and\n\n313\n00:15:55.810 --> 00:15:57.248\nmake sure we can contact it.\n\n314\n00:15:57.248 --> 00:15:59.777\nAnd then it's gonna prompt me for\ncredentials.\n\n315\n00:15:59.777 --> 00:16:01.640\nAnd once I give it the credentials, and\n\n316\n00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:04.250\nso I need to give it a valid\nuser account on that server.\n\n317\n00:16:05.970 --> 00:16:09.290\nBoy, this is a challenges and what is\na valid account tha I have of that server?\n\n318\n00:16:09.290 --> 00:16:11.135\nLet's try this one.\n\n319\n00:16:11.135 --> 00:16:12.886\nWe'll see.\n\n320\n00:16:12.886 --> 00:16:15.210\nThere we go.\nSo I'm gonna provide it the account, and\n\n321\n00:16:15.210 --> 00:16:19.090\nonce that's done I get\na list of the folders and\n\n322\n00:16:19.090 --> 00:16:21.170\nthat's what I like cuz I can't remember.\n\n323\n00:16:21.170 --> 00:16:23.430\nBut the problem here is I'm\nconnecting to the server and\n\n324\n00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:26.140\nthis is just showing me here under\nthe one credential that I provided.\n\n325\n00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:29.450\nNow for most of us we just have one\ncredential this works perfect, but\n\n326\n00:16:29.450 --> 00:16:32.200\nif you have multiple accounts on that\nserver, different ones with different\n\n327\n00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:36.250\naccess then you'll wanna put the folder\nname in the connection string.\n\n328\n00:16:36.250 --> 00:16:40.050\nEither way works, so I'm gonna go\nahead and connect to file share and\n\n329\n00:16:40.050 --> 00:16:41.430\nI'll just hit OK.\n\n330\n00:16:41.430 --> 00:16:42.420\nAnd that's gonna connect up.\n\n331\n00:16:42.420 --> 00:16:43.970\nNow once it connects,\n\n332\n00:16:45.190 --> 00:16:49.000\nsee over here how I get the icon on my\ndesktop cuz I turn that option on, and\n\n333\n00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.930\nover here, it shows up under share but\nI've got a bit of a problem.\n\n334\n00:16:52.930 --> 00:16:56.980\nNow I've got two different connections,\none via FTP, one via SMB.\n\n335\n00:16:56.980 --> 00:16:57.560\nWhich is fine.\n\n336\n00:16:57.560 --> 00:17:00.190\nIt just can't render it twice\nin the shared window so\n\n337\n00:17:00.190 --> 00:17:03.150\nit actually doesn't show up\ntwice here like you'd expect.\n\n338\n00:17:03.150 --> 00:17:07.970\nBut I am connected, I am able to see that,\nI can browse right into it.\n\n339\n00:17:07.970 --> 00:17:13.330\nI can access that file and I'm doing\nit via SMB now, Server Message Block.\n\n340\n00:17:13.330 --> 00:17:18.070\nNow SMB supports encrypted sessions,\nit encrypts the username and\n\n341\n00:17:18.070 --> 00:17:22.400\npassword when it's sent in transit and it\nsupports other features, other bells and\n\n342\n00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:25.170\nwhistles that are built into it that\nmake it far more efficient than FTP.\n\n343\n00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:29.670\nYou can make the argument that\nI'm connected via FTP and SMB so\n\n344\n00:17:29.670 --> 00:17:33.400\nif they both work the same and\nFTP is easier why not just use it?\n\n345\n00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:36.440\nWell there's a lot of advanced\nfunctionality baked into SMB that make it\n\n346\n00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:38.660\nmore attractive, and\nthat's the one you want to use.\n\n347\n00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:41.030\nSo that's typically what you'll see, and\n\n348\n00:17:41.030 --> 00:17:42.540\nit's the one that shows up on the exam,\nright?\n\n349\n00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:44.930\nSMB is the one you're gonna\nsee on most of the questions.\n\n350\n00:17:44.930 --> 00:17:50.160\nAll right now a couple other things\nI just wanna highlight here.\n\n351\n00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:52.979\nIn that connect to server screen,\nlet me just close all these.\n\n352\n00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:58.370\nWhen you connect to a server,\nI was typing in the server information and\n\n353\n00:17:58.370 --> 00:17:59.520\nthen hitting Connect.\n\n354\n00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:03.140\nBut if it's something you connect to\nfrequently, you can come in here and\n\n355\n00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:04.120\ntype in the information.\n\n356\n00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:09.015\nAnd then you hit the plus sign and\nthat's gonna save it, right?\n\n357\n00:18:09.015 --> 00:18:10.265\nIt doesn't actually connect you, right?\n\n358\n00:18:10.265 --> 00:18:12.995\nYou don't connect 'til you hit,\nwell the labels connect.\n\n359\n00:18:12.995 --> 00:18:15.305\nBut we hit pause and\njust saves us a bookmark and\n\n360\n00:18:15.305 --> 00:18:17.745\nthat way in the future if you like me,\nyou can never remember.\n\n361\n00:18:17.745 --> 00:18:20.755\nYou just double click on that and\nit will connect right up to the server and\n\n362\n00:18:20.755 --> 00:18:23.325\ngo right to that folder and\nget us where we want to be and\n\n363\n00:18:23.325 --> 00:18:26.235\nyou can set up favorites for\nany number of things, right?\n\n364\n00:18:26.235 --> 00:18:30.070\nSo, I might have that FTP server\nthat I want to connect to also.\n\n365\n00:18:30.070 --> 00:18:33.260\nAnd so I can come in here and\nspecify the FTP server.\n\n366\n00:18:34.510 --> 00:18:36.330\nAnd we'll get that thrown in there.\n\n367\n00:18:36.330 --> 00:18:39.910\nAnd now they're all kind of remembered and\nstored right there when you get them.\n\n368\n00:18:39.910 --> 00:18:41.870\n&gt;&gt; And these are connecting\nautomatically when you log in or\n\n369\n00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:44.500\nI'm still gonna have to go in this dialog\nand choose which one I want to connect?\n\n370\n00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:46.080\n&gt;&gt; You still have to come into the dialog,\nright.\n\n371\n00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:48.190\nThere is an option buried away\nin the settings where you\n\n372\n00:18:48.190 --> 00:18:51.000\ncan tell it to reconnect when you log in,\nbut by default they're gonna go away.\n\n373\n00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.620\nSo when I log out they're gonna eject,\nright?\n\n374\n00:18:53.620 --> 00:18:57.260\nKinda like removing USB media and they\nwon't reconnect until I come in here and\n\n375\n00:18:57.260 --> 00:19:00.270\ndouble click on them and\ngive it a go like that.\n\n376\n00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:04.950\nNow, with each of this,\nI've been talking about file sharing,\n\n377\n00:19:04.950 --> 00:19:06.470\nthere is more that you can do from here.\n\n378\n00:19:06.470 --> 00:19:08.620\nFor example, screen sharing, right?\n\n379\n00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:13.360\nAnd if I had another Mac on the network\nI can actually type in vnc://,\n\n380\n00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:17.940\nthis will work with Windows or, or\nLinux boxes that are running VNC also.\n\n381\n00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:19.330\nVNC is virtual network computing.\n\n382\n00:19:19.330 --> 00:19:23.890\nAnd it's a technology that lets you\nsee the screen of another computer.\n\n383\n00:19:23.890 --> 00:19:26.730\nWell, our Macs have screen\nsharing built into them.\n\n384\n00:19:26.730 --> 00:19:30.780\nBut what they don't tell you is it's\nactually using VNC the standard protocol.\n\n385\n00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:33.100\nAnd so you could type in vnc:// and\n\n386\n00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:39.770\nthe name of a client you wanted to connect\nto and store that in here just the same.\n\n387\n00:19:39.770 --> 00:19:42.750\nAnd now whenever you wanted to\npull the screen up you'd get it.\n\n388\n00:19:42.750 --> 00:19:45.720\nIt's not file sharing right, you're\nactually doing streaming of the screen.\n\n389\n00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:49.110\nBut it's another thing that we can\nput in here as a book mark for us.\n\n390\n00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:52.740\nAll right once that's done we\nare able to jump onto connect,\n\n391\n00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:54.830\nI got into that file share just fine.\n\n392\n00:19:54.830 --> 00:19:59.570\nSo we saw FTP and SMB,\nthat's what these two were.\n\n393\n00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:04.890\nWe could also do NFS it\nlooks exactly the same.\n\n394\n00:20:04.890 --> 00:20:06.390\nSo not really anything too exciting there.\n\n395\n00:20:06.390 --> 00:20:10.310\nEven WebDAV looks exactly the same and\nonce it's done.\n\n396\n00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:12.448\nIt's just a matter of providing\nthe right protocol name when we connect.\n\n397\n00:20:12.448 --> 00:20:14.170\n&gt;&gt; Very good.\n\n398\n00:20:14.170 --> 00:20:17.100\n&gt;&gt; Now, I've been looking at\neverything from the client side, right?\n\n399\n00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:18.990\nWhat about the server side?\n\n400\n00:20:18.990 --> 00:20:21.370\nWell, for those of you that go\ninto Mac management basics,\n\n401\n00:20:21.370 --> 00:20:23.500\nwe'll take a look at file\nsharing on the server.\n\n402\n00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:24.980\nIt's actually not even that hard.\n\n403\n00:20:24.980 --> 00:20:25.760\nWhere is my server?\n\n404\n00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:27.010\nI've got a server parked here.\n\n405\n00:20:27.010 --> 00:20:29.250\nHere, here's my server and\n\n406\n00:20:29.250 --> 00:20:33.850\nin the OS10 server Service application,\nWhatever you wanna call it.\n\n407\n00:20:33.850 --> 00:20:35.560\nUnder services you got File Sharing and\n\n408\n00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:39.050\nyou can specify the folders that you\nwanna share in the permissions and so on.\n\n409\n00:20:39.050 --> 00:20:42.000\nIn looks,\nlike it's all fancy service stuff.\n\n410\n00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:42.660\nBut in reality,\n\n411\n00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:46.840\nthis is just a pretty face stuck on\nwhat's called personal file sharing.\n\n412\n00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:50.400\nPersonal file sharing is built\nin the every Mac Any Mac\n\n413\n00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:55.020\ncan become a file server, it doesn't have\nto be a server, it can be a Mac mini,\n\n414\n00:20:55.020 --> 00:21:00.150\na Mac Book, you wouldn't normally use a\nlaptop because laptops come and go right?\n\n415\n00:21:00.150 --> 00:21:01.590\nFile servers you want to\nbe there all the time, so\n\n416\n00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:04.830\nit's normally gonna be like an iMac,\na Mac Pro, a Mac Mini.\n\n417\n00:21:04.830 --> 00:21:07.210\nMac Mini makes great file servers\nbecause they're cheap and\n\n418\n00:21:07.210 --> 00:21:11.860\nyou can stick a bunch of external storage\non them so they do really good with that.\n\n419\n00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:15.840\nBut you don't need the server\napp to be a file server.\n\n420\n00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:18.750\nIt's built into every single Mac.\n\n421\n00:21:18.750 --> 00:21:20.400\nThat at the end of the day,\n\n422\n00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:25.380\nMac OS server is the same operating\nsystem as Mac OS on a work station.\n\n423\n00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:28.540\nIts the same, it's just one has\nan extra little utility for\n\n424\n00:21:28.540 --> 00:21:31.280\nmanaging the services in the background,\notherwise they're identical.\n\n425\n00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:36.550\nSo on a regular Mac OS system you\ncan turn on personal file sharing,\n\n426\n00:21:36.550 --> 00:21:39.060\nand share files and\nfolders right from your own Mac,\n\n427\n00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:41.650\nand you'll find where it's actually\nalready set up for a lot of that,\n\n428\n00:21:41.650 --> 00:21:44.290\nso let's run over that system,\nand kind of see how that works.\n\n429\n00:21:44.290 --> 00:21:47.380\nI'm gonna jump into my System Preferences,\nand\n\n430\n00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:52.440\nin my System Preferences, you'll see\none preference called Sharing, and\n\n431\n00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:56.630\nif we go into Sharing Here is where we\ncan turn on sharing for our system.\n\n432\n00:21:56.630 --> 00:22:00.610\nAnd this is also coincidently where\nwe identify the name of our system.\n\n433\n00:22:00.610 --> 00:22:03.130\nWhen I first set this up I created\nan account called Help Desk.\n\n434\n00:22:03.130 --> 00:22:06.010\nAnd so\nthis was called Help Desk's Mac Book Pro.\n\n435\n00:22:06.010 --> 00:22:08.680\nAnd I changed it to make\nit LAB-CLIENT101 but\n\n436\n00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:10.280\nthis is where you can change\nthe name of your machine.\n\n437\n00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:12.420\nMake it more identifiable, right?\n\n438\n00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:15.250\nMike's laptop is probably called\nsomething like Mike's Mac Book.\n\n439\n00:22:15.250 --> 00:22:19.590\nWell what if I have more than one Mike,\nI don't know which Mike it is right,\n\n440\n00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:22.270\nso it might be lame Mike, it might be\ncool Mike, I don't know which one.\n\n441\n00:22:22.270 --> 00:22:25.670\nSo he could change his to be lame Mike and\nthen we know yeah all right that's his.\n\n442\n00:22:25.670 --> 00:22:29.240\nSo that's an important thing just\nto be able to identify systems but\n\n443\n00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:32.040\nthe other thing is we can\nconfigure what we share and\n\n444\n00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:34.040\nyou'll see what you've\ngot printer sharing.\n\n445\n00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:36.850\nYou've got screen sharing that\nI talked about a moment ago.\n\n446\n00:22:36.850 --> 00:22:38.810\nAnd more importantly\nyou've got file sharing.\n\n447\n00:22:38.810 --> 00:22:43.410\nAnd this is the personal file sharing\nwhich technically is the same as what's\n\n448\n00:22:43.410 --> 00:22:47.440\non the server, except that's server,\nfile sharing it's fancier.\n\n449\n00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:50.070\nBut here basically if we turn this on\n\n450\n00:22:50.070 --> 00:22:53.950\nwe can now start to share\nresources on this laptop.\n\n451\n00:22:53.950 --> 00:22:57.010\nAnd if you look,\nI'm already sharing a few things, right?\n\n452\n00:22:57.010 --> 00:22:59.450\nIn the last episode,\nwe talked about directory services.\n\n453\n00:22:59.450 --> 00:23:01.030\nI created an account for\nChristopher Walkins.\n\n454\n00:23:01.030 --> 00:23:04.590\nSo, I've got a Helpdesk account and\na Christopher Walkin account.\n\n455\n00:23:04.590 --> 00:23:06.660\nYou'll see that by default,\n\n456\n00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:10.300\nthere's one folder shared out for\nevery user on your system.\n\n457\n00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:13.350\nAs you add more users, they'll start\nto get these folders shared out.\n\n458\n00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:16.130\nAnd it'll be whatever their name is,\nand then it'll say Public folder.\n\n459\n00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:21.110\nSo for example,\nif I go back here to Users and\n\n460\n00:23:21.110 --> 00:23:23.690\nI don't have an account for\nmyself, actually I do.\n\n461\n00:23:23.690 --> 00:23:25.100\nI guess I've never logged in.\n\n462\n00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:27.250\nIf you've never logged in,\nthe folder doesn't exist yet.\n\n463\n00:23:27.250 --> 00:23:33.850\nSo I must not have every logged it but\neach user has a home directory.\n\n464\n00:23:33.850 --> 00:23:37.140\nAnd that home directory if we\nwere to browse our hard drive.\n\n465\n00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:42.680\nSo I'm gonna go to Macintosh HD,\nand Go into Users.\n\n466\n00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:45.260\nEvery user has their own folder.\n\n467\n00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:48.590\nSo here's helpdesk, that's me,\nthen there's dpezet, and cwalken and\n\n468\n00:23:48.590 --> 00:23:49.180\neach of the user.\n\n469\n00:23:49.180 --> 00:23:52.510\nAnd when you browse into there\nthey have folders inside of it.\n\n470\n00:23:52.510 --> 00:23:55.539\nAnd there's one folder called Public.\n\n471\n00:23:55.539 --> 00:23:58.410\nThis Public folder is the one\nthat's shared by default.\n\n472\n00:23:58.410 --> 00:24:01.964\nAnd this is one that says, hey, I want\nother people to have access to this data.\n\n473\n00:24:01.964 --> 00:24:06.980\nAnything that I put in here,\nI'm considering public, all right?\n\n474\n00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:08.730\nWhat do we mean by public?\n\n475\n00:24:08.730 --> 00:24:12.300\nWell, if you look back here at\nthe sharing permissions, and\n\n476\n00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:17.410\nI take Help Desk Public Folder,\nI can see over here where,\n\n477\n00:24:17.410 --> 00:24:20.530\nme, Help Desk,\nI have Read and Write access.\n\n478\n00:24:20.530 --> 00:24:21.990\nI can put whatever I want in there.\n\n479\n00:24:21.990 --> 00:24:23.690\nI can change this, I can delete it.\n\n480\n00:24:23.690 --> 00:24:27.840\nBut everybody else,\neveryone else, has read only.\n\n481\n00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:30.770\nSo, that means anybody on my network,\nwhether they login or not, they\n\n482\n00:24:30.770 --> 00:24:35.510\ncould be a guest, and they come in and\nthey can see whatever's in that folder.\n\n483\n00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:37.720\nNow, what's in that folder by default?\n\n484\n00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:38.470\nAbsolutely nothing.\n\n485\n00:24:38.470 --> 00:24:39.750\nIt's empty.\n\n486\n00:24:39.750 --> 00:24:41.970\nSo, Apple shares it by default,\nit's available for\n\n487\n00:24:41.970 --> 00:24:44.490\nyou to make available, and off you go.\n\n488\n00:24:44.490 --> 00:24:47.540\nYou can also create your own folders.\n\n489\n00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:51.720\nAnd when you create your own folders,\nyou put your data in there and\n\n490\n00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:54.270\nyou determine what you want\nthose provisions to be.\n\n491\n00:24:54.270 --> 00:25:00.008\nSo for example, maybe I have a folder,\nlet me go to my documents here,\n\n492\n00:25:00.008 --> 00:25:04.029\nand I might have a folder in here called\n\n493\n00:25:05.590 --> 00:25:09.460\nDon's Secret Info, right?\n\n494\n00:25:09.460 --> 00:25:12.660\nThis is only I should have access to.\n\n495\n00:25:12.660 --> 00:25:15.930\nAnd then, maybe I create\nanother folder which will be\n\n496\n00:25:15.930 --> 00:25:20.340\nlike a corporate report, okay.\n\n497\n00:25:20.340 --> 00:25:23.770\nAnd I have different permissions\nI want to apply to these.\n\n498\n00:25:23.770 --> 00:25:28.226\nWell back in my system preferences\nI can add these folders in.\n\n499\n00:25:28.226 --> 00:25:31.943\nAnd when I go to add the folders, see I\ncan just browse to my documents folders\n\n500\n00:25:31.943 --> 00:25:35.830\nwhere it goes by default, and\nI can pick the corporate report folder.\n\n501\n00:25:35.830 --> 00:25:36.720\nAnd I can add that one in.\n\n502\n00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:39.170\nAnd then I can hit Add again.\n\n503\n00:25:39.170 --> 00:25:43.440\nAnd this time I'm gonna go back to\ndocuments and add in Don's Secret Info.\n\n504\n00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:47.320\nAnd so now I've got Don's Secret Info and\ncorporate okay?\n\n505\n00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:54.366\nFor the corporate report, I want Mike to\nbe able to come in and see that data okay.\n\n506\n00:25:54.366 --> 00:25:56.538\nOr I want Christopher Walken\nto be able to come in and\n\n507\n00:25:56.538 --> 00:25:59.540\nsee that data because he reviews\nall of our corporate data here.\n\n508\n00:25:59.540 --> 00:26:04.290\nSo I don't want everyone to have access,\nI can come and\n\n509\n00:26:04.290 --> 00:26:06.140\ntake that and set it to no access.\n\n510\n00:26:06.140 --> 00:26:09.980\nEveryone gets no access, and then staff.\n\n511\n00:26:09.980 --> 00:26:11.300\nGets read only, who is Staff?\n\n512\n00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:14.070\nStaff is anybody that has a user\naccount on this computer.\n\n513\n00:26:14.070 --> 00:26:15.340\nMaybe I don't want that.\n\n514\n00:26:15.340 --> 00:26:18.680\nMaybe I really wanted to just be me and\nChristopher Walken.\n\n515\n00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:22.420\nWell, when I pull this list up,\nsee how I can't really change it?\n\n516\n00:26:22.420 --> 00:26:24.820\nI don't have a No Access for Staff.\n\n517\n00:26:24.820 --> 00:26:29.540\nSo this folder is going to be visible\nto other people on this computer.\n\n518\n00:26:29.540 --> 00:26:31.690\nThat's the big difference between this and\nthe server side.\n\n519\n00:26:31.690 --> 00:26:34.900\nOn the server side, we can be a lot more\nrestrictive on who would have that access.\n\n520\n00:26:34.900 --> 00:26:36.880\nBut here it's kind of limiting me on that.\n\n521\n00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:39.970\nAnd then I've got the HelpDesk,\nwhich is my user.\n\n522\n00:26:39.970 --> 00:26:44.560\nBut I can come in and\nI can add in Christopher Walken.\n\n523\n00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:48.270\nOr if I was connected to a directory\nservice, I can add in any user that was in\n\n524\n00:26:48.270 --> 00:26:51.100\nthat directory service and\nspecify who they were and\n\n525\n00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:56.390\nI can give them that elevated access,\nlike read and write.\n\n526\n00:26:56.390 --> 00:26:59.680\nOkay, read means they can just view\nthe file, but they can't change it.\n\n527\n00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:03.180\nRead and write means they can change,\nand even delete the file too, right?\n\n528\n00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:05.390\nSo now I can pick those permissions.\n\n529\n00:27:05.390 --> 00:27:09.641\nAnd I can go and kind of tweak\nthings based on what it is exactly,\n\n530\n00:27:09.641 --> 00:27:12.304\nthat I wanna have that access, right.\n\n531\n00:27:12.304 --> 00:27:15.950\nOnce that's done I'm now sharing this\nthey're available on the network right?\n\n532\n00:27:15.950 --> 00:27:19.640\nThere was one other permission, and\nit really talk about it which was Dropbox.\n\n533\n00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:24.150\nDropbox is an interesting permission,\nit says that people can drop files.\n\n534\n00:27:24.150 --> 00:27:26.850\nThey can upload files into this folder,\nbut that's it.\n\n535\n00:27:26.850 --> 00:27:29.270\nThey can't read the folder,\nthey can't see what's in there.\n\n536\n00:27:29.270 --> 00:27:32.570\nThink of it's like,\na night deposit box in a bank.\n\n537\n00:27:32.570 --> 00:27:35.020\nYou drive up to the box,\nyou can drop your envelope in there.\n\n538\n00:27:35.020 --> 00:27:37.680\nYou can't see how many other\nenvelopes are in the box already, and\n\n539\n00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:39.710\nyou can't even get your envelope back.\n\n540\n00:27:39.710 --> 00:27:40.840\nOnce it's in, it's in there.\n\n541\n00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:44.290\nSo if I have, maybe I'm a teacher, and\nI have a classroom full of students, and\n\n542\n00:27:44.290 --> 00:27:46.460\nI want them all to give me their papers.\n\n543\n00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:49.140\nThey could go and they would see my\ndrop-box, but it would look empty to them.\n\n544\n00:27:49.140 --> 00:27:52.260\nAnd they could drop their\npaper into the drop-box.\n\n545\n00:27:52.260 --> 00:27:54.410\nAnd then it would disappear.\n\n546\n00:27:54.410 --> 00:27:56.600\nAnd they wouldn't see the other students,\nthey wouldn't even see theirs.\n\n547\n00:27:56.600 --> 00:27:59.440\nBut I would log into the folder, and\nI would see all of their papers.\n\n548\n00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:01.430\nThat's what that drop box permission is,\nit's kinda neat.\n\n549\n00:28:01.430 --> 00:28:03.220\nAnd you actually have\na drop box by default.\n\n550\n00:28:03.220 --> 00:28:05.680\nIf you look in your Documents folder, so\n\n551\n00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:08.940\nlet me browse back into\nmy Documents folder.\n\n552\n00:28:10.630 --> 00:28:11.620\nAnd, or not in Documents, sorry.\n\n553\n00:28:11.620 --> 00:28:14.620\nIf I go into my actual Home folder.\n\n554\n00:28:14.620 --> 00:28:20.080\nWhen you go to your Home folder, you'll\nsee that Public folder, there we go.\n\n555\n00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:23.980\nAnd if I go into my Public folder,\nthere's a Drop Box folder.\n\n556\n00:28:23.980 --> 00:28:27.170\nSo when you share out your Public folder,\nthe Public folder is public for\n\n557\n00:28:27.170 --> 00:28:28.720\neverybody to read and write.\n\n558\n00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:32.080\nBut then the Dropbox folder is\nthat one that's kinda protected\n\n559\n00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:35.250\nwhere they can drop data in there and then\nit kinda disappears so that one exists.\n\n560\n00:28:35.250 --> 00:28:37.430\nBut you can create your own Dropbox\nthe permission is easy to set.\n\n561\n00:28:38.892 --> 00:28:42.390\nAll right, the other thing I wanna\nhighlight back here in my share settings,\n\n562\n00:28:42.390 --> 00:28:44.732\nis that all the sharing\nthat we're setting up,\n\n563\n00:28:44.732 --> 00:28:48.250\nnotice up here where it\nsays file sharing is on.\n\n564\n00:28:48.250 --> 00:28:51.638\nAnd other users can access\nthe shared folders and\n\n565\n00:28:51.638 --> 00:28:57.592\nadministrators can access all\nvolumes at smb://192.168.0.129.\n\n566\n00:28:57.592 --> 00:28:58.827\nAll right, what is that?\n\n567\n00:28:58.827 --> 00:29:03.290\nWell, it's telling me that\nI've enabled the smb protocol.\n\n568\n00:29:03.290 --> 00:29:04.750\nI'm sharing this the Windows way.\n\n569\n00:29:04.750 --> 00:29:06.080\nBut I'm on Mac.\n\n570\n00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:08.070\nBut it's defaulting to the Windows way.\n\n571\n00:29:08.070 --> 00:29:11.640\nBecause that's the default protocol\nthat most businesses are using,\n\n572\n00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:16.010\nthis Mac is gonna participate that\nway to increase compatibility, right?\n\n573\n00:29:16.010 --> 00:29:18.670\nAnd then the IP address is listed here\ncuz I didn't use a DNS name when I set\n\n574\n00:29:18.670 --> 00:29:19.650\nall this stuff up.\n\n575\n00:29:19.650 --> 00:29:24.170\nYou'll see your Bonjour ID up here, which\nis just how people normally find you on\n\n576\n00:29:24.170 --> 00:29:26.950\nthe network when you're using\nthings like Apple File Protocol.\n\n577\n00:29:26.950 --> 00:29:28.220\nBut if you go to Options right here,\n\n578\n00:29:28.220 --> 00:29:31.780\nyou can actually tweak which\nprotocols you support.\n\n579\n00:29:31.780 --> 00:29:34.200\nAnd see how mine is set to Share files and\nfolders using SMB,\n\n580\n00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:37.590\nand it's got AFP turned off.\n\n581\n00:29:37.590 --> 00:29:42.140\nIn Mac OS Sierra,\nAFP is turned off by default.\n\n582\n00:29:42.140 --> 00:29:45.820\nI'm on a Mac,\nI could be in an all-Mac environment, and\n\n583\n00:29:45.820 --> 00:29:49.790\nif we're all running Mac OS Sierra,\nwe're still gonna be using SMB.\n\n584\n00:29:49.790 --> 00:29:52.780\nAnd that's just because\nSMB is the de facto\n\n585\n00:29:52.780 --> 00:29:54.970\nprotocol that's used on business networks.\n\n586\n00:29:54.970 --> 00:29:57.590\nYou might wanna switch to AFP,\nor you might wanna support both,\n\n587\n00:29:57.590 --> 00:29:59.410\nand you certainly can.\n\n588\n00:29:59.410 --> 00:30:03.050\nIf you check both boxes,\nnow you do both, AFP and SMB,\n\n589\n00:30:03.050 --> 00:30:06.570\nor you can turn SMB off, and\nnow you're only supporting AFP.\n\n590\n00:30:06.570 --> 00:30:11.000\nNow, if you just do AFP Windows machines\nwill no longer be able to connect to you.\n\n591\n00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:12.150\nWindows doesn't support AFP.\n\n592\n00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:15.900\nNeither does Linux for that matter,\nthey won't be able to connect to you.\n\n593\n00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:20.730\nBut if you leave SMB on, Windows can\nnatively connect to you, and Linux boxes\n\n594\n00:30:20.730 --> 00:30:24.670\ncan use a service called Samba, and that\nwill allow them to connect in here also.\n\n595\n00:30:24.670 --> 00:30:29.189\nSo, Linux and Windows can both connect via\nSMB and that's another reason why that one\n\n596\n00:30:29.189 --> 00:30:32.733\nis enabled by default, is for\nthat cross compatibility, right.\n\n597\n00:30:32.733 --> 00:30:35.284\nAnd then you can dictate which\nuser accounts are valid for\n\n598\n00:30:35.284 --> 00:30:37.940\nWindows file sharing when\na Windows client connects.\n\n599\n00:30:37.940 --> 00:30:41.290\nCuz you might not want somebody to\nconnect as Christopher Walken or\n\n600\n00:30:41.290 --> 00:30:41.930\nHelp Desk or whatever.\n\n601\n00:30:41.930 --> 00:30:44.740\nSo you can kind of filter out which\nusers you didn't want to support.\n\n602\n00:30:46.450 --> 00:30:50.650\nAll right, now see how the screen changed\nto show the two different addresses,\n\n603\n00:30:50.650 --> 00:30:52.030\nAFP and SNB.\n\n604\n00:30:52.030 --> 00:30:55.300\nPeople can now browse the network and\nconnect and access those resources.\n\n605\n00:30:55.300 --> 00:30:57.628\nAnd I can jump over to a Mac now.\n\n606\n00:30:57.628 --> 00:30:59.663\nI'll just close that window.\n\n607\n00:30:59.663 --> 00:31:02.454\nAnd let me jump over to my other Mac.\n\n608\n00:31:02.454 --> 00:31:07.485\nAnd on this client if I go and\nbrowse the network,\n\n609\n00:31:07.485 --> 00:31:11.535\nwhen we go and look at the shared systems\n\n610\n00:31:11.535 --> 00:31:16.352\nthat are on the network\ndo I see the lab client?\n\n611\n00:31:16.352 --> 00:31:17.255\nHere we go.\n\n612\n00:31:17.255 --> 00:31:19.964\nI see lab client01 and\nit's got a question mark,\n\n613\n00:31:19.964 --> 00:31:23.430\na question mark because I haven't\nauthenticated it against it?\n\n614\n00:31:23.430 --> 00:31:25.830\nI haven't given it a username and\na password and so\n\n615\n00:31:25.830 --> 00:31:30.160\nI need to hit this connect as button and\nI can tell it who I am, right.\n\n616\n00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:32.120\nHey, I'm help desk.\n\n617\n00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:35.740\nSo I'm gonna provide that\nlogin information and connect.\n\n618\n00:31:35.740 --> 00:31:37.150\nAnd now, I see the folders.\n\n619\n00:31:37.150 --> 00:31:41.440\nAnd I see HelpDesk's Public or\nChristopher Watkin's Public.\n\n620\n00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:45.040\nI see the Corporate Report and\nDon's Secret Info that we shared out.\n\n621\n00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:48.230\nI see the HelpDesk folder cuz\nI'm logged in his HelpDesk.\n\n622\n00:31:48.230 --> 00:31:49.910\nSo I see my own home folder and\n\n623\n00:31:49.910 --> 00:31:52.690\nthen I see the hard drive itself\nbecause I'm an administrator.\n\n624\n00:31:52.690 --> 00:31:56.020\nThe administrator sees the entire hard\ndrive so we now have access to that.\n\n625\n00:31:56.020 --> 00:32:00.710\nSo I'm able to connect and exchange that\ninformation and it works seamlessly.\n\n626\n00:32:00.710 --> 00:32:05.620\nNow did I connect via AFP or\nSMB when I did this?\n\n627\n00:32:05.620 --> 00:32:06.440\n&gt;&gt; That's a good question.\n\n628\n00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:08.830\n&gt;&gt; We it actually defaults to SMB, and\n\n629\n00:32:08.830 --> 00:32:11.730\nunless I disable SMB it's gonna\ndefault to that one, right.\n\n630\n00:32:11.730 --> 00:32:16.375\nSo it did use it, even though is Mac\nto Mac I did use SMB when I connected.\n\n631\n00:32:16.375 --> 00:32:18.280\nIt's seamless to me,\nit's invisible, right.\n\n632\n00:32:18.280 --> 00:32:20.199\nWe don't see that but\nthat's what happened in the background.\n\n633\n00:32:21.660 --> 00:32:24.240\nAll right so\nlet's see that is a pretty good run,\n\n634\n00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:26.030\nI'm trying to think if I\nmissed anything on this Mike.\n\n635\n00:32:26.030 --> 00:32:27.760\n&gt;&gt; That's a pretty thorough look.\n\n636\n00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:28.840\n&gt;&gt; That's pretty much it,\n\n637\n00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:31.670\ndo keep in mind if you go onto Mac\nmanagement basics we will cover file\n\n638\n00:32:31.670 --> 00:32:35.370\nsharing again from the server perspective\nif you're setting up OS 10 Server.\n\n639\n00:32:35.370 --> 00:32:37.920\nIt's a little bit different,\nit's got some logging and\n\n640\n00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:39.420\nsome advanced functionality there.\n\n641\n00:32:39.420 --> 00:32:42.150\nBut on the personal file sharing\nit's pretty straight forward as\n\n642\n00:32:42.150 --> 00:32:43.590\nlong as you know your protocol types.\n\n643\n00:32:43.590 --> 00:32:45.260\nMake sure you remember those for the exam.\n\n644\n00:32:45.260 --> 00:32:46.700\n&gt;&gt; All right Don, great information there.\n\n645\n00:32:46.700 --> 00:32:48.600\nShowing us how we can\ntake our Mac book and\n\n646\n00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:51.690\nconnect to different file shares on our\nnetworks, on our corporate networks, and\n\n647\n00:32:51.690 --> 00:32:55.880\nour home networks using the different\nprotocols, like the Apple File Protocol.\n\n648\n00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:58.910\nOr server message block and\na couple of others in there.\n\n649\n00:32:58.910 --> 00:33:00.120\nSo we appreciate that.\n\n650\n00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:02.350\nWe hope everybody out there\nenjoyed watching this one.\n\n651\n00:33:02.350 --> 00:33:05.291\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n652\n00:33:05.291 --> 00:33:06.171\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n653\n00:33:06.171 --> 00:33:08.250\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n654\n00:33:08.250 --> 00:33:14.159\n[MUSIC]\n\n655\n00:33:14.159 -->

00:00:08.256\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.256 --> 00:00:12.230\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.040\n&gt;&gt; Hello, welcome to another\nexciting episode here at ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:20.131\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick and today we're\ndoing your MAC integration basics and\n\n7\n00:00:20.131 --> 00:00:24.221\nspecifically in this episode, we're gonna\nbe taking a look at collaboration and\n\n8\n00:00:24.221 --> 00:00:24.829\nsoftware.\n\n9\n00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:28.090\nAnd here to help us with that of course\nis Mr. Don Pezet, welcome back Don.\n\n10\n00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:29.630\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for having me back Mike.\n\n11\n00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:32.730\nReady to dive right into collaboration and\nthis is one of the episodes that's\n\n12\n00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.260\na little bit weird for me cuz all through\nMac integration basis we're talking about\n\n13\n00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.620\ntaking a Mac and\nintegrating it into your business, right?\n\n14\n00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.220\nAnd the idea is that you've got things\n\n15\n00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.520\nother than Apple products somewhere in\nyour business that you need to connect to.\n\n16\n00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.189\nBut when it comes to\ncollaboration software,\n\n17\n00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.360\nthere's not really this native\ncollaboration software on\n\n18\n00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.790\nthe Mac side that's any different\nthan on Windows or whatever.\n\n19\n00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:58.782\nSo it's not like we're really trying to\nintegrate into something that's truly\n\n20\n00:00:58.782 --> 00:01:01.874\ndifferent, it's standards and protocols\nthat everybody has to integrate with.\n\n21\n00:01:01.874 --> 00:01:05.108\nSo, it's a little bit different than\nthe other episodes here coz this is pretty\n\n22\n00:01:05.108 --> 00:01:06.181\nmuch just run of the mill.\n\n23\n00:01:06.181 --> 00:01:10.310\nHow we get connected to an email server or\ncounter server or contact server,\n\n24\n00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.578\nthe different ways that we collaborate.\n\n25\n00:01:12.578 --> 00:01:15.960\nNow later on in this series we\nare gonna talk a little bit about like\n\n26\n00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.924\ninstant messaging and that's where\nthings really start to get different.\n\n27\n00:01:19.924 --> 00:01:23.130\nThat there are native messaging protocols\nthat are part of Mac OS that are not\n\n28\n00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.370\na part of other OS's.\n\n29\n00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:27.000\nAnd then do we need to integrate with\nother OS's first test, kinda works.\n\n30\n00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.460\nSo we'll see more of that as this\nseries progresses but in this episode,\n\n31\n00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:37.600\nwe're really focusing on three key things,\nemail, calendar, contacts, right?\n\n32\n00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.170\nWhen it comes to the Internet, the\nInternet is not really a required tool for\n\n33\n00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.010\nmost people to do their work.\n\n34\n00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.710\nI know, it's shocking.\n\n35\n00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.490\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If I'm a insurance agent,\n\n36\n00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.180\nI don't necessarily need access to\nYouTube to sell insurance, right?\n\n37\n00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.940\nBut email, contacts, calendar,\nnow we're looking at something different,\n\n38\n00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:00.210\nthis is something that is a pivotal\nimportant piece in most people's job\n\n39\n00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.023\nfunction, and\nit's critical that we have it.\n\n40\n00:02:03.023 --> 00:02:05.595\nAnd as a result, people don't like\nto mess with their email servers,\n\n41\n00:02:05.595 --> 00:02:07.210\nif their email servers are up and\nrunning and\n\n42\n00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.548\nworking a certain way,\npeople typically don't change them.\n\n43\n00:02:09.548 --> 00:02:10.475\n&gt;&gt; Don't touch it.\n\n44\n00:02:10.475 --> 00:02:13.103\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nyeah really cuz if someone doesn't\n\n45\n00:02:13.103 --> 00:02:15.882\nknow how to access email\nthat is a nightmare.\n\n46\n00:02:15.882 --> 00:02:19.318\nIt's like it used to be, you remember in\nthe olden days if someones printer stopped\n\n47\n00:02:19.318 --> 00:02:20.904\nworking you never heard the end of it.\n\n48\n00:02:20.904 --> 00:02:23.655\nNow if they can't get into\ntheir email that's a big deal.\n\n49\n00:02:23.655 --> 00:02:26.900\nNow I understand right for a lot of\ncompanies that's how they communicate with\n\n50\n00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.420\ntheir customers, email's pretty critical.\n\n51\n00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.380\nCalendar pretty critical too because\nhow do I know what I'm doing today?\n\n52\n00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:35.160\nIf I don't have a calendar I don't know,\nheck I have a calendar and\n\n53\n00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.808\ndon't know what I'm doing most days.\n\n54\n00:02:36.808 --> 00:02:41.250\nBut at least it helps somewhat and\nthen contacts.\n\n55\n00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.263\nWho was that person that I met\nat that conference last year,\n\n56\n00:02:44.263 --> 00:02:47.164\nI need to reach out to them,\nwhat was their phone number?\n\n57\n00:02:47.164 --> 00:02:49.321\nI need contacts to be able to see that.\n\n58\n00:02:49.321 --> 00:02:54.750\nNow when you install Mac OS,\nit has mail right, the mail app.\n\n59\n00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.308\nIt's got contacts, and\nit's got a calendars app right?\n\n60\n00:02:57.308 --> 00:03:00.597\nAll just natively built in and\nappropriately named mail, contacts,\n\n61\n00:03:00.597 --> 00:03:01.219\ncalendars.\n\n62\n00:03:01.219 --> 00:03:03.320\nSo we kind of have an idea\nof what each one does.\n\n63\n00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:04.840\n&gt;&gt; Easy breezy episode done then.\n\n64\n00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:05.430\nWhat else do I need?\n\n65\n00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:06.910\n&gt;&gt; Yeah super simple right?\n\n66\n00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:11.942\nWell, the thing here that really starts to\ncause the need for us to have an episode\n\n67\n00:03:11.942 --> 00:03:16.387\non this, is that Apple doesn't\nactually make their own email server.\n\n68\n00:03:16.387 --> 00:03:18.387\nAnd they don't make their\nown contacts server,\n\n69\n00:03:18.387 --> 00:03:21.640\nthey don't make their own calendar server,\nor do they?\n\n70\n00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.028\nActually they do as a part\nof the iCloud service.\n\n71\n00:03:25.028 --> 00:03:26.746\nIf you're using an iCloud account, and\n\n72\n00:03:26.746 --> 00:03:29.015\nremember this is an extension\nof the old .Me stuff.\n\n73\n00:03:29.015 --> 00:03:33.780\nRight so some of us that are older\nApple users will have .me accounts.\n\n74\n00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.546\nWhere Apple provided us\na cloud email server and\n\n75\n00:03:37.546 --> 00:03:40.564\na cloud contacts and cloud calendar.\n\n76\n00:03:40.564 --> 00:03:43.120\nAnd it was great,\nI shouldn't say was it still exist, right?\n\n77\n00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:48.070\nSo it is great because then I could\ntake my Mac and throw it in the thrash.\n\n78\n00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:52.530\nBuy a brand new one log in and\nimmediately connect up to iCloud and\n\n79\n00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.170\nhave access to my mail, contacts,\nand calendars it's all right there.\n\n80\n00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:58.121\nSo that's the native Apple solution.\n\n81\n00:03:58.121 --> 00:04:02.400\nBut who controls those servers, Apple.\n\n82\n00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.140\nIf I work at a hospital or\n\n83\n00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:07.970\na financial institution,\nthey have regulatory compliance issues.\n\n84\n00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:09.930\nThey have to control their own servers.\n\n85\n00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:13.110\nThey need their own email\ncontact calendar services.\n\n86\n00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:14.410\nThey can't use Apple's.\n\n87\n00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:16.870\nAnd now is where we get\ninto the integration part.\n\n88\n00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:21.900\nWe need to connect our Macs to what's\nusually an on premises email solution.\n\n89\n00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:25.308\nNot a cloud solution like .me or\niCloud or whatever, but\n\n90\n00:04:25.308 --> 00:04:27.305\nsomething that's on premises.\n\n91\n00:04:27.305 --> 00:04:29.488\nFortunately, in the email world,\n\n92\n00:04:29.488 --> 00:04:34.530\nthere's really just a couple of standard\nprotocols that almost everybody uses.\n\n93\n00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:36.852\nAnd I'm being careful to\nsay things like should and\n\n94\n00:04:36.852 --> 00:04:38.958\nalmost here cuz there's always exceptions.\n\n95\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:42.727\nIn the email world,\nthere's two main protocols for\n\n96\n00:04:42.727 --> 00:04:46.419\nreceiving mail and\none protocol for sending mail.\n\n97\n00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:50.249\nWhen it comes to sending\nemail there's SMTP,\n\n98\n00:04:50.249 --> 00:04:54.373\nthe Simple Message Transport\nProtocol SMTP, and\n\n99\n00:04:54.373 --> 00:04:57.834\nwhat SMTP does, Simple Mail Transport.\n\n100\n00:04:57.834 --> 00:04:58.360\n&gt;&gt; Mail.\n\n101\n00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:59.975\n&gt;&gt; Okay we got to get this right,\nnot message.\n\n102\n00:04:59.975 --> 00:05:02.240\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\nSimple Mail Transport Protocol.\n\n103\n00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:05.624\nAnd what it does it allows two e-mail\nservers to forward e-mails between\n\n104\n00:05:05.624 --> 00:05:07.699\neach other, but\nour clients can use it too for\n\n105\n00:05:07.699 --> 00:05:10.936\nsending e-mail up to the servers to\nget it routed to wherever it goes.\n\n106\n00:05:10.936 --> 00:05:13.930\nSMTP is how we send an e-mail.\n\n107\n00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:17.570\nAnd to put it to the analogy\nof like physical mail.\n\n108\n00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:20.160\nIf I want to send a physical letter\nto somebody, I write the letter,\n\n109\n00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:25.160\nI stick it in an envelope I walk out my\nfront door and I put it in a mailbox.\n\n110\n00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.553\nThat's an outbound mailbox right.\n\n111\n00:05:27.553 --> 00:05:31.534\nThe mailman pulls up and sees the flag\nup on the box and grabs the letter and\n\n112\n00:05:31.534 --> 00:05:32.530\ngoes right?\n\n113\n00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:33.793\nThat's what SMTP does.\n\n114\n00:05:33.793 --> 00:05:37.299\nSMTP is how I take that letter and\nI give it to the server and I say, hey,\n\n115\n00:05:37.299 --> 00:05:39.340\ncan you send this to where it needs to go?\n\n116\n00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:42.560\nAnd the server takes it and\nruns with it from there right?\n\n117\n00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:46.810\nAlmost every mail server\nin the world supports SMTP,\n\n118\n00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:51.160\nbecause it is the standard for\nforwarding mail between servers.\n\n119\n00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:54.566\nSo, even if I connect to my ISO mail\nserver with a different protocol,\n\n120\n00:05:54.566 --> 00:05:58.282\nwhen it goes to forward to the next\nserver in line it's gonna switch to SMTP.\n\n121\n00:05:58.282 --> 00:05:59.790\nSo that makes it easy, right?\n\n122\n00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:03.340\nWe don't have to worry about whether we're\nintegrating with Microsoft or Novell.\n\n123\n00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:07.120\nOr some open-source solution\nlike Sendmail or whatever,\n\n124\n00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:09.776\nwe know that they're all gonna use SMTP.\n\n125\n00:06:09.776 --> 00:06:12.230\nSo that makes life a little easier there.\n\n126\n00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:15.600\nOn the receiving side though,\nif I wanna receive email.\n\n127\n00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:17.600\nThere's two main protocols that we see.\n\n128\n00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:23.218\nThere's Post Office Protocol, POP,\nand IMAP, the Internet Message,\n\n129\n00:06:23.218 --> 00:06:28.660\nwell I'm gonna screw this one up, [LAUGH]\nThe Internet Message Access Protocol.\n\n130\n00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:29.935\nThere we go that's why\nwe should have notes.\n\n131\n00:06:29.935 --> 00:06:33.870\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And, [LAUGH] What they do is they let\n\n132\n00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:38.760\nme log into a mailbox and retrieve email,\nI receive the email right?\n\n133\n00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:42.513\nNow the two protocols are very very\nsimilar, they're both very old,\n\n134\n00:06:42.513 --> 00:06:46.088\nthey both let me connect to my\nmailbox nad let me retrieve my email.\n\n135\n00:06:46.088 --> 00:06:50.486\nPOP 3, Post Office Protocol\nversion 3 is the most common,\n\n136\n00:06:50.486 --> 00:06:53.330\nwell it's the oldest of the two.\n\n137\n00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:56.740\nAnd it allows you to quickly use it to get\nin your mailbox and get your messages.\n\n138\n00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:58.480\nBut it doesn't have\na whole lot of features,\n\n139\n00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:00.440\ndoesn't have a whole lot of bells and\nwhistles.\n\n140\n00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:03.750\nAnd one of the biggest problems with\nit is it doesn't support sub folders.\n\n141\n00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:06.760\nAnd I use the heck out of\nfolders in my mailbox.\n\n142\n00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:10.060\nAnd also,\nit doesn't support multiple devices.\n\n143\n00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:13.371\nSo if I check an email on my phone,\nand then I go, and\n\n144\n00:07:13.371 --> 00:07:17.310\ncheck email on my laptop,\nI'm not gonna see the same thing.\n\n145\n00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:20.838\nThe phone stole an email, the laptop\ndidn't, or if I leave it on the server\n\n146\n00:07:20.838 --> 00:07:24.260\nthe phone might have marked it as red,\nbut the laptop doesn't see that.\n\n147\n00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.640\nThe pop doesn't work that way.\n\n148\n00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:30.611\nPop was designed in the earlier day when\nthe idea of somebody having more than one\n\n149\n00:07:30.611 --> 00:07:31.921\ncomputer was crazy talk.\n\n150\n00:07:31.921 --> 00:07:36.067\nVersus today where you've probably got\na computer on your wrist right now,\n\n151\n00:07:36.067 --> 00:07:40.162\nnot to mention your tablet and your\nphone and your laptop and your desktop.\n\n152\n00:07:40.162 --> 00:07:42.310\nAnd so\nwe check email from all over the place.\n\n153\n00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:44.840\nAnd that's where IMAP comes in.\n\n154\n00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:48.458\nIMAP supports sub folders and\nit lets you mark an email as read and\n\n155\n00:07:48.458 --> 00:07:51.547\nall of your other devices\nsee that it's already read.\n\n156\n00:07:51.547 --> 00:07:54.282\nAnd when you reply,\nthe replies all go to a sent items box and\n\n157\n00:07:54.282 --> 00:07:56.439\neverybody kinda sees it\nall in this one place.\n\n158\n00:07:56.439 --> 00:08:01.129\nSo IMAP 4, the IMAP Version 4, is the most\ncommon one that's supported today\n\n159\n00:08:01.129 --> 00:08:04.530\nbecause of those extra bells and\nwhistles, right?\n\n160\n00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:06.100\nPOP 3 is the oldest.\n\n161\n00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:09.790\nIMAP 4 is a little bit newer,\nbut it's still pretty old.\n\n162\n00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:11.810\nThey were both developed\nback in the 1980s, so\n\n163\n00:08:11.810 --> 00:08:15.660\nthey're not new by any means but\nthey are pretty widely supported.\n\n164\n00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:17.300\nSo when we go to integrate\nwith the system,\n\n165\n00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:21.230\nwe're normally gonna be using\none of those protocols, right?\n\n166\n00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:24.680\nSo if I take a mark like mine right\nhere and I wanna get it connected.\n\n167\n00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:29.760\nWell, if I was gonna use iCloud, I will\njump up here into my system preferences.\n\n168\n00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:31.980\nAnd in my system preferences,\n\n169\n00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:36.310\nI could go down here to iCloud and\nI could sign in with my Apple Id and\n\n170\n00:08:36.310 --> 00:08:40.180\nit could get me set up for\nusing all of that stuff through iCloud.\n\n171\n00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:44.450\nBut if I'm integrating with\nsomebody elses system,\n\n172\n00:08:44.450 --> 00:08:46.670\nthan I'm gonna need to set\nit up a different way.\n\n173\n00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:51.190\nAnd we've got internet\naccounts right here.\n\n174\n00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:53.830\nAnd internet accounts is\nkind of a generic term.\n\n175\n00:08:53.830 --> 00:08:55.140\nIt's not just mail, but\n\n176\n00:08:55.140 --> 00:09:00.000\nit's also calendar, contacts, instant\nmessaging falls under there, cideo chat.\n\n177\n00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.700\nThere's a few different things\nthat all fall into that.\n\n178\n00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:03.430\nThat's why they keep it nice and generic.\n\n179\n00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:04.810\nInternet accounts.\n\n180\n00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:07.810\nBut when I go in here,\nI can add an internet account.\n\n181\n00:09:07.810 --> 00:09:12.190\nAnd I can add a connection to iCloud,\nor Microsoft Exchange,\n\n182\n00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:14.850\nor Twitter, or Facebook, or whatever.\n\n183\n00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:17.410\nAnd if I go down here\nto add Other Account,\n\n184\n00:09:17.410 --> 00:09:20.240\nwe'll see where I can add a mail account.\n\n185\n00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:24.650\nOr a calendar, or a contact,\nor whatever, right.\n\n186\n00:09:24.650 --> 00:09:28.520\nNow as we look at these Mail\naccount's pretty generic, right?\n\n187\n00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:34.480\nWell that's gonna be POP3, or IMAP, or\nSMTP the one's I've been talking about.\n\n188\n00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:35.400\nUnder calendar,\n\n189\n00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:40.110\nyou have CalDAV which is calendar\ndistributed authoring and versioning.\n\n190\n00:09:40.110 --> 00:09:43.500\nIt's a protocol that's used for\nexchanging calendar items.\n\n191\n00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:47.390\nPOP three, IMAP four, they're designed for\nemail, not calendars.\n\n192\n00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:48.550\nThey don't do that, right?\n\n193\n00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:51.220\nSo calendars are technically\na separate technology.\n\n194\n00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:55.370\nAnd same thing with contacts,\nthere's card dab for business cards.\n\n195\n00:09:55.370 --> 00:10:00.340\nCard distributed offering and versioning\nthat we can log into a Contact server and\n\n196\n00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:01.900\nget all of our contacts.\n\n197\n00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:03.160\nNow that's complex.\n\n198\n00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:05.490\nWhen it's just email, it's one thing.\n\n199\n00:10:05.490 --> 00:10:09.440\nBut now when I start bringing calendars\nand contacts, it gets really complex.\n\n200\n00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:14.070\nSo some vendors, like Microsoft,\ncombine things together.\n\n201\n00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:19.600\nWhen I go back out to my internet\naccounts, and well I try to go back.\n\n202\n00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:21.780\nIf I scroll up instead\nof trying to go back.\n\n203\n00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:23.970\nI've got Exchange right nere.\n\n204\n00:10:23.970 --> 00:10:28.580\nMicrosoft Exchange is an email server,\nbut it's more than email.\n\n205\n00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:31.790\nIt also does contacts and calendars.\n\n206\n00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:35.860\nIt does shared calendars,\nit does chats and other things.\n\n207\n00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:40.830\nIt's got a lot of different collaboration\nmechanisms all built into one technology.\n\n208\n00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:44.770\nAnd so I can connect to a Microsoft\nExchange Server and it will automatically\n\n209\n00:10:44.770 --> 00:10:50.760\nconnect up My contacts,\nmy calendar and my email all at once.\n\n210\n00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:53.100\nWe can integrate right\ninto that environment, and\n\n211\n00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:56.320\nExchange is very popular amongst\nenterprises and businesses.\n\n212\n00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:59.720\nSo we've got that support natively built\ninto the operating system right here,\n\n213\n00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:02.840\nwe use our standard Apple apps but\nwe're connecting to the Microsoft server.\n\n214\n00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:08.300\nRight but for a moment let's just back\nup and say we just wanna do email.\n\n215\n00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:09.890\nSo let's do a standard email example and\n\n216\n00:11:09.890 --> 00:11:12.200\nthen we'll get into\nExchange afterwards right?\n\n217\n00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:15.720\nSo the easiest way to add these\nif you're just doing email for\n\n218\n00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:19.000\nexample is not to go to that\ninternet accounts page at all right?\n\n219\n00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.390\nI can just fire up.\n\n220\n00:11:20.390 --> 00:11:21.440\nMail.\n\n221\n00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:23.870\nOr I can fire up Contacts or Calendar.\n\n222\n00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:25.980\nI'm gonna fire up the Mail app, okay?\n\n223\n00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:29.710\nAnd when I launch the Mail app,\nby default it has no account.\n\n224\n00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:32.620\nAnd so it's asking me what\ndo I wanna use for email?\n\n225\n00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:35.800\nAnd if I'm using Google, Yahoo!, AOL.\n\n226\n00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:39.970\niCloud exchange I can just choose that and\nit'll already have most of the options to\n\n227\n00:11:39.970 --> 00:11:45.130\nfind that server and get connected or\nI can say other mail account.\n\n228\n00:11:45.130 --> 00:11:49.010\nAnd when I say other, now I can\nthe provide the key information to\n\n229\n00:11:49.010 --> 00:11:51.460\nauthenticate now this is where\nthings get a little tricky.\n\n230\n00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:55.670\nSome systems have set up\nwhat's called auto discover.\n\n231\n00:11:55.670 --> 00:12:00.080\nAuto discover is where if I\njust give my email address\n\n232\n00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:05.380\nIt can automatically find the servers that\nI'm connected to in the other information.\n\n233\n00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:08.990\nBut if my administrators haven't\nset up auto detect it won't be able\n\n234\n00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:09.550\nto figure that out.\n\n235\n00:12:09.550 --> 00:12:11.810\nAnd I'll have to give server names.\n\n236\n00:12:11.810 --> 00:12:13.480\nAnd other information.\n\n237\n00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:16.140\nSo I'm gonna connect with\na demo account that I have.\n\n238\n00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:19.830\nAnd so I'm gonna connect with this one.\n\n239\n00:12:19.830 --> 00:12:25.230\nAnd I don't remember if we\nset up Autodiscover or not.\n\n240\n00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:26.050\nI think we did.\n\n241\n00:12:26.050 --> 00:12:27.740\nSo, I am going to punch this one in.\n\n242\n00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:33.001\nAnd see if I can remember what\nthe password is for this one.\n\n243\n00:12:36.371 --> 00:12:38.770\nAnd, oops, there we go.\n\n244\n00:12:38.770 --> 00:12:41.200\nAll right, so I'm gonna reach out.\n\n245\n00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:43.870\nSo it's gonna try to find that for me.\n\n246\n00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:47.160\nAnd if it can auto discover it as great,\nit will find it.\n\n247\n00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:52.030\nIf it can't it's then gonna start\nasking me about the server to connect.\n\n248\n00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:55.390\nAnd notice here the account type\nI can pick between IMAP and\n\n249\n00:12:55.390 --> 00:12:58.860\nPOP, SMTP doesn't show up on the list,\nwhy?\n\n250\n00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:02.800\nBecause SMTP is the only protocol for\nsending, so there's no choice there,\n\n251\n00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:07.730\nit knows I'm gonna use SMTP, but for\nreceiving, I can pick between IMAP and\n\n252\n00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:09.580\nPOP, so\nthat's what it's asking right here.\n\n253\n00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:12.760\nAnd that's why we don't see the third\noption and so I can tell it.\n\n254\n00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:17.820\nI understand that most systems support\nboth, that you can do POP or I Map.\n\n255\n00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:21.670\nIf you get to pick,\nyou always wanna pick I Map right\n\n256\n00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:24.670\nthat's the one that's got the advanced\nfunctions that's what you want.\n\n257\n00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:29.680\nBut I'm gonna need to specify what my\nusername is right which in my case.\n\n258\n00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:30.480\nUnless I typed it wrong.\n\n259\n00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:32.970\nIt's actually saying unable to\nverify account name or passwords.\n\n260\n00:13:32.970 --> 00:13:35.430\nBut I either typed the username or\nthe password wrong.\n\n261\n00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:38.360\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; I'm thinking I got the username right\n\n262\n00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:39.810\nso I'm assuming I typed\nthe password wrong.\n\n263\n00:13:39.810 --> 00:13:43.320\nSo I'm just gonna type that again.\n\n264\n00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:50.370\nAnd then I need to specify\nthe incoming and outgoing mail server.\n\n265\n00:13:50.370 --> 00:13:51.980\nNow the outgoing mail\nserver's gonna use SMTP.\n\n266\n00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:54.920\nBut the incoming server is not.\n\n267\n00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:57.900\nSo I need to provide the email server\nthat I'm gonna connect to for iMap for\n\n268\n00:13:57.900 --> 00:13:59.190\nthe incoming server.\n\n269\n00:13:59.190 --> 00:14:00.660\nAnd they might be the same server.\n\n270\n00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:03.540\nYou might have mail.itpro.tv.\n\n271\n00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:05.130\nOr something like that, okay?\n\n272\n00:14:05.130 --> 00:14:06.590\nAnd it might be the same for both.\n\n273\n00:14:06.590 --> 00:14:09.470\nThere's plenty of places that do that,\nright?\n\n274\n00:14:09.470 --> 00:14:12.090\nBut there's plenty of places\nthat keep them separate\n\n275\n00:14:12.090 --> 00:14:15.280\nalso because the SMTP server's\nnormally exposed to the internet\n\n276\n00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:17.730\nversus the IMF server which\nis a little more private.\n\n277\n00:14:17.730 --> 00:14:21.260\nSo you'll need to specify your credentials\nfor whatever it is that your using.\n\n278\n00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:24.070\nIn this case this is actually\na Office 365 account,\n\n279\n00:14:24.070 --> 00:14:26.240\nit's one that's hosted by Microsoft.\n\n280\n00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:30.860\nSo for the incoming mail server, I'm gonna\ncome in and specify what that server is.\n\n281\n00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:33.350\nIn my case,\nit would be outlook.office365.com, and\n\n282\n00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:38.130\nthen for the Outgoing Server,\n\n283\n00:14:38.130 --> 00:14:44.430\nit's going to be smtp.office365.com, now,\nwhere did I get that information from?\n\n284\n00:14:44.430 --> 00:14:47.290\nFrom Microsoft, from whoever your\nadministrator is, whoever set up your\n\n285\n00:14:47.290 --> 00:14:49.490\nemail servers, they'll give you this\ninformation to be able to connect.\n\n286\n00:14:50.610 --> 00:14:53.700\nAnd I see that it conveniently\nwrite down my user name.\n\n287\n00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:58.600\nSo let me take that and\npunch that back in.\n\n288\n00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:05.790\nAnd pretty sure I typed that password\nwrong so try that one more time, okay.\n\n289\n00:15:05.790 --> 00:15:10.750\nAnd we'll go and sign in.\n\n290\n00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:14.610\nNow when you sign in,\nit's reaching out to both servers.\n\n291\n00:15:14.610 --> 00:15:17.080\nIt's gonna reach out to the incoming and\nthe outbound servers.\n\n292\n00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:18.370\nIt's got to test your credentials on both.\n\n293\n00:15:18.370 --> 00:15:20.910\nIf it doesn't work you'll\nget a warning about that.\n\n294\n00:15:20.910 --> 00:15:22.250\nAnd then it's getting connected.\n\n295\n00:15:22.250 --> 00:15:24.580\nNow notice this connecting mail and notes.\n\n296\n00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:27.230\nI'm only connecting to a mail server,\nwhat the heck is this notes thing?\n\n297\n00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:30.540\nWell all a note is,\nis an email to yourself.\n\n298\n00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:34.010\nIMap will actually create a folder called\nnotes and it's full of emails to yourself.\n\n299\n00:15:34.010 --> 00:15:37.590\nNow, In the client it renders\nthem as like Post-it notes.\n\n300\n00:15:37.590 --> 00:15:40.100\nBut in reality they are just\nemails stored on the server and\n\n301\n00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:41.340\nthey just don't go anywhere.\n\n302\n00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:43.680\nSo mail and\nnotes are technically the same thing,\n\n303\n00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:45.710\nthey're just rendered different visually.\n\n304\n00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:48.920\nBut once that's one,\nI'm now connected to my mail server.\n\n305\n00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:50.760\nAnd, here I am.\n\n306\n00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:52.885\nAnd here comes some emails, right, sweet.\n\n307\n00:15:52.885 --> 00:15:54.292\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; So I got some email, I'm in here.\n\n308\n00:15:54.292 --> 00:15:57.930\nLooks like Joey and Lance and\na few other people have all been talking.\n\n309\n00:15:57.930 --> 00:15:59.469\nAnd Here we go, we're connected.\n\n310\n00:15:59.469 --> 00:16:01.626\nI'm ready to collaborate and\nwe talked to the boys in the band.\n\n311\n00:16:01.626 --> 00:16:05.450\nNow, once I'm in here though,\nthis is just mail.\n\n312\n00:16:05.450 --> 00:16:06.890\nWhat about my contact?\n\n313\n00:16:06.890 --> 00:16:07.950\nWhere are the contacts coming from?\n\n314\n00:16:07.950 --> 00:16:09.380\nWhat about my calendar?\n\n315\n00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:11.070\nWhere's my calendar coming from?\n\n316\n00:16:11.070 --> 00:16:12.930\nWell, other servers, right?\n\n317\n00:16:12.930 --> 00:16:16.850\nI would need to come in here and\nfire up the calendar app.\n\n318\n00:16:16.850 --> 00:16:20.670\nAnd in the calendar app it's gonna come\nup and hey, I don't have calendar.\n\n319\n00:16:20.670 --> 00:16:21.710\nSo I need to get one set up.\n\n320\n00:16:21.710 --> 00:16:25.280\nAnd when I continue,\nit's gonna create a local calendar.\n\n321\n00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:26.980\nThis current calendar stored\nright here in this laptop.\n\n322\n00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:28.997\nIf I get a new laptop,\nwhat happens to this calendar?\n\n323\n00:16:28.997 --> 00:16:31.180\nIt's gone right.\n\n324\n00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:34.530\nSo I need to add in a network\naccount of some sort.\n\n325\n00:16:34.530 --> 00:16:39.740\nAnd if I go up here to Calendar,\nI can choose, under the calendar menu,\n\n326\n00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:46.220\nI can go to Accounts, and\nin here we can add an account.\n\n327\n00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:50.130\nAnd it's even showing the email\naccount that we connected to before.\n\n328\n00:16:50.130 --> 00:16:54.005\nAssuming hey, maybe that server\nsupports contacts, maybe it doesn't.\n\n329\n00:16:54.005 --> 00:16:57.739\nBut, if I hit my little plus sign to add\na new account, we can come down here and\n\n330\n00:16:57.739 --> 00:16:59.310\nchoose to add another account.\n\n331\n00:16:59.310 --> 00:17:03.350\nAnd we can specify a CalDAV server, right?\n\n332\n00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:06.284\nAnd I can specify the calendar server\nthat I'm going to be reaching out and\n\n333\n00:17:06.284 --> 00:17:07.290\nconnecting to, right?\n\n334\n00:17:07.290 --> 00:17:10.200\nSo we can connect to that server and\nthen sync our contacts.\n\n335\n00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:14.727\nAnd we can do the same thing in contacts\nand connect to it that way, right?\n\n336\n00:17:14.727 --> 00:17:19.380\nBut, CalDAV and\nCarDAV actually not very popular at all.\n\n337\n00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:23.484\nIf you have an Apple OS10 server fired up,\nyou can bring your own CardDAV and\n\n338\n00:17:23.484 --> 00:17:25.331\nCalDAV app, it's not that hard.\n\n339\n00:17:25.331 --> 00:17:28.620\nBut most of the time when people\ndo collaboration like this,\n\n340\n00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:31.530\nit's gonna be using one\nof Microsoft's protocols.\n\n341\n00:17:31.530 --> 00:17:34.650\nThe Microsoft's Exchange Servers\ntypically the way that that's handled.\n\n342\n00:17:34.650 --> 00:17:36.710\nSo what I'm gonna do is,\nI'm gonna cancel out of this.\n\n343\n00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:43.710\nAnd I'm gonna go back to my email here and\nin my email, let me go to Accounts.\n\n344\n00:17:43.710 --> 00:17:45.610\nAnd I'm gonna get rid of\nthe accounts that we added.\n\n345\n00:17:45.610 --> 00:17:51.050\nSo, this is the Jowie account that\nwe added, I'm gonna remove that.\n\n346\n00:17:51.050 --> 00:17:54.370\nSo we'll just get rid of it, so\nI've got no email accounts now.\n\n347\n00:17:54.370 --> 00:17:58.394\nAnd this is where the Internet\naccount part comes in really handy.\n\n348\n00:17:58.394 --> 00:18:02.926\nThat if I go into my System Preferences,\nand I go into Internet Accounts, and\n\n349\n00:18:02.926 --> 00:18:05.787\nI connect to something like iCloud or\nExchange,\n\n350\n00:18:05.787 --> 00:18:08.500\nit can connect all three at the same time.\n\n351\n00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:11.030\nMail, Contacts, Calendar, all at once.\n\n352\n00:18:11.030 --> 00:18:13.740\nSo when I choose Microsoft Exchange,\nI'm logging into\n\n353\n00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:16.500\na Microsoft Exchange server that maybe\nis on premises that we can control.\n\n354\n00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:19.920\nOr maybe it's Office 365 and\nit's hosted up in the Cloud, right,\n\n355\n00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:21.720\nor whatever it is that we need.\n\n356\n00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:22.680\nIt supports that.\n\n357\n00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:25.040\nApple actually pays a licensing\nfee to Microsoft for\n\n358\n00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:27.500\nthe support,\nto make sure that it works perfectly.\n\n359\n00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:30.180\nThis isn't something that was like\ncobbled together as an Open Source\n\n360\n00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:31.580\nproject on the side.\n\n361\n00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:33.690\nBelieve me there's some of that\nbaked into the Operating System.\n\n362\n00:18:33.690 --> 00:18:36.550\nBut in this case,\nit's a truly licensed connection\n\n363\n00:18:36.550 --> 00:18:39.290\nto make it where we fully\nsupport everything in exchange.\n\n364\n00:18:39.290 --> 00:18:44.720\nWhich includes Calendars and Contacts,\nand all of this stuff inside of that.\n\n365\n00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:54.230\nSo if I log in as Joey again, Got to\nstick a shorter domain on that thing.\n\n366\n00:18:54.230 --> 00:18:56.790\nSo I'm gonna just punch that in and\nI'll try and\n\n367\n00:18:56.790 --> 00:18:58.300\nget the password right the first time.\n\n368\n00:19:00.986 --> 00:19:02.630\nThere we go that should do it.\n\n369\n00:19:03.650 --> 00:19:05.760\nSo it's gonna reach out,\nit's trying to do auto discover.\n\n370\n00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:08.380\nSo it's trying to find the server\nto be able to connect to.\n\n371\n00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:10.600\nIf it doesn't, no sweat, I'll type it in.\n\n372\n00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:14.105\nBut it's gonna try and find it,\nit should auto discover it.\n\n373\n00:19:14.105 --> 00:19:17.565\nAnd it's gonna connect my mail,\nmy contacts, and my calendar.\n\n374\n00:19:17.565 --> 00:19:19.785\nSee, I don't just see mail and\nnotes this time.\n\n375\n00:19:19.785 --> 00:19:21.755\nNow I've got contacts,\ncalendars, and reminders.\n\n376\n00:19:21.755 --> 00:19:24.715\nReminders are just calendar items that\nare hidden with a timer on them, right?\n\n377\n00:19:24.715 --> 00:19:26.325\nSo those are kind of part of that.\n\n378\n00:19:26.325 --> 00:19:29.075\nSo it's connecting all of them at once.\n\n379\n00:19:29.075 --> 00:19:32.961\nAnd when I say done, now I'm connected,\nthe same thing would have happened for\n\n380\n00:19:32.961 --> 00:19:33.838\niCloud, right?\n\n381\n00:19:33.838 --> 00:19:41.790\nAnd if I fire up my calendar, and\nI go into the calendar, see what I've got?\n\n382\n00:19:41.790 --> 00:19:42.910\nCalendar items now?\n\n383\n00:19:42.910 --> 00:19:44.640\nThose weren't there a minute ago, right?\n\n384\n00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:47.710\nThose are coming from Exchange.\n\n385\n00:19:47.710 --> 00:19:50.170\nI've got exchange, calendar, birthdays.\n\n386\n00:19:50.170 --> 00:19:51.910\nI still have the local\nstuff that's on my MAC.\n\n387\n00:19:51.910 --> 00:19:54.530\nBut I don't wanna use that because\nit is not stored up in the Cloud.\n\n388\n00:19:54.530 --> 00:19:56.580\nIt's not synchronized between machines.\n\n389\n00:19:56.580 --> 00:19:57.500\nThese is.\n\n390\n00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:02.970\nAnd if I go into Contacts,\nwe can jump into the contacts.\n\n391\n00:20:04.390 --> 00:20:07.490\nAnd again, I've got the stuff that's\non my computer,but I've also got\n\n392\n00:20:07.490 --> 00:20:08.440\nthings in Exchange.\n\n393\n00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:09.980\nApparently, I don't have\nany contacts there.\n\n394\n00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:12.600\nBut these are ones that are stored\non the server that are synchronized\n\n395\n00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:13.230\nbetween devices.\n\n396\n00:20:13.230 --> 00:20:14.390\nSo if I have a mobile phone,\n\n397\n00:20:14.390 --> 00:20:17.986\nlike if I check my iPhone and I connect it\nto Exchange, cuz that works perfectly too.\n\n398\n00:20:17.986 --> 00:20:22.516\nAnd then I'll see those contacts in place\nand be able to work from there, and mail.\n\n399\n00:20:22.516 --> 00:20:24.320\nI guess that kind of goes without saying,\nright?\n\n400\n00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:29.020\nIf I fire up mail, it'll be connected,\nwhich it might actually be mad at me.\n\n401\n00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:29.960\nI sort of doubt.\n\n402\n00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:32.440\nCause I was connected with iMap first and\nthen Flip.\n\n403\n00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:34.070\nBut it sorted it out.\n\n404\n00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:37.200\nSo we're connected and there we go.\n\n405\n00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:38.950\nNow we're into that one too, right?\n\n406\n00:20:38.950 --> 00:20:43.550\nSo for mail, contacts, and calendar, three\nthings that are very important to most\n\n407\n00:20:43.550 --> 00:20:45.370\nof your employees,\nwe're pretty well covered.\n\n408\n00:20:45.370 --> 00:20:47.390\nIf you use iCloud for\nhome users that's great,\n\n409\n00:20:47.390 --> 00:20:49.220\nthat's really the perfect solution for\na home user.\n\n410\n00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:52.590\nJust use iCloud it's all hosted and\ntaken care of for you and you're done.\n\n411\n00:20:52.590 --> 00:20:53.540\nBut for a business,\n\n412\n00:20:53.540 --> 00:20:57.110\nif you need to manage your own solution,\nyou're welcome to do that.\n\n413\n00:20:57.110 --> 00:21:00.350\nYou can bring up\nMicrosoft Exchange if you want, or\n\n414\n00:21:00.350 --> 00:21:03.780\nyou can do, what's it Novels and,\nwhat's it called?\n\n415\n00:21:03.780 --> 00:21:07.270\nI've gotten the other.\n\n416\n00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:08.980\n&gt;&gt; That's at their mail?\n\n417\n00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:11.097\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] I already forgot the name.\n\n418\n00:21:11.097 --> 00:21:14.364\nIt's still used in quite\na few places out there.\n\n419\n00:21:14.364 --> 00:21:18.900\nYou can fire up a Unix server\nrunning SendMail or Squirrelmail, or\n\n420\n00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:23.780\nany of the various products that\nare in the OpenSource world.\n\n421\n00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:25.500\nAnd your Mac will connect\nto them just fine, right.\n\n422\n00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:27.050\nBecause Pop3, iMac4, and\n\n423\n00:21:27.050 --> 00:21:32.050\nSMTP are standards that are supported\nby every email system that's out there.\n\n424\n00:21:32.050 --> 00:21:35.370\n&gt;&gt; CardDAV and CalDAV are open\nstandards that are supported by most\n\n425\n00:21:35.370 --> 00:21:36.440\nthings that are out there.\n\n426\n00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:38.520\nSo you can build up this type\nof collaborative environment.\n\n427\n00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:39.710\nAnd it's not really a big deal.\n\n428\n00:21:39.710 --> 00:21:44.052\nAnd there's more and more cloud services\ncoming out all the time like Zoho.\n\n429\n00:21:44.052 --> 00:21:46.205\nWhere businesses can connect to that.\n\n430\n00:21:46.205 --> 00:21:49.545\nAnd usually, they piggy back off of\nExchange, where you tell it your\n\n431\n00:21:49.545 --> 00:21:52.435\nconnecting to an Exchange server\nthat's actually a third party service.\n\n432\n00:21:52.435 --> 00:21:56.465\nGoogle did that for a long time, where\nit looked like an Exchange server but\n\n433\n00:21:56.465 --> 00:21:58.815\nin reality it was Google on the backend.\n\n434\n00:21:58.815 --> 00:22:01.205\nSo there are different ways that you\nconnect that way that you would get that\n\n435\n00:22:01.205 --> 00:22:01.835\nfull support.\n\n436\n00:22:01.835 --> 00:22:06.180\nSo really, not a challenge getting\nintegrated into that type of environment.\n\n437\n00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:08.442\n&gt;&gt; All right, Don, again, fantastic look.\n\n438\n00:22:08.442 --> 00:22:11.410\nReally making it easy when it\ncomes to integrating our Mac.\n\n439\n00:22:11.410 --> 00:22:17.400\nTying into our mail services, our calendar\nservices, our contacts, so we can work and\n\n440\n00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:21.150\nbe functional in a business environment-\n&gt;&gt; As productive as we ever are,\n\n441\n00:22:21.150 --> 00:22:21.760\nright [LAUGH]?\n\n442\n00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:24.520\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH].\nAll right, Don, we appreciate that.\n\n443\n00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:26.700\nWe hope everybody out there\nenjoyed watching this one.\n\n444\n00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:29.500\nSigning off for ITPRO.TV,\nI've been your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n445\n00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:30.173\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n446\n00:22:30.173 --> 00:22:35.954\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n447\n00:22:35.954 --> 00:22:38.426\n[MUSIC]\n\n448\n00:22:38.426 --> 00:22:40.752\nThank you for watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n",

00:00:11.132\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPROTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.132 --> 00:00:12.300\n&gt;&gt; Hello.\n\n5\n00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.191\nWelcome to another exciting\nepisode here at ITPROTV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.191 --> 00:00:19.970\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick and today we\nare doing our Mac integration basics and\n\n7\n00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:23.480\nspecifically in this episode We're gonna\nbe diving into some of the security\n\n8\n00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.490\nfeatures that we can implement in our Mac\nOS, and here to help us with that is Mr.\n\n9\n00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:28.860\nDon Pezet, welcome back, Don.\n\n10\n00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:29.750\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for having me back, Mike,\n\n11\n00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:32.610\nyeah, ready to dive into security,\nand we're gonna take a look at really\n\n12\n00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.620\ntwo different types of security\nfeatures in this episode.\n\n13\n00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.050\nThere's features that we can implement,\n\n14\n00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.210\nthings that we can turn on that just\naren't turned on by default and\n\n15\n00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.060\nwe're gonna take a look at some that\nactually are turned on by default, that we\n\n16\n00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:46.640\ncan't even mess with that are just a part\nof the system and that's just how it is.\n\n17\n00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.620\nSo it's kind of neat to see\nthe different spectrums here.\n\n18\n00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:54.950\nBut Apple has spent a lot of time ensuring\nthat Mac OS is a secure operating system.\n\n19\n00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:57.510\nAnd with every update,\nwith every major update, and\n\n20\n00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.950\nminor update, they're patching security\nflaws and making things more secure.\n\n21\n00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:05.770\nYou'll hear a lot of people say things\nwhich are sometimes nonsensical like,\n\n22\n00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.880\nmy Mac can't get hacked or I don't\nneed anti virus software on my Mac.\n\n23\n00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.300\nAnd those statements as like\nan absolute are false but\n\n24\n00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.020\nthe reality is Apple does probably\nthe best job in the industry of\n\n25\n00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.410\nmaking sure the operating\nsystem is secure, patched and\n\n26\n00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:24.370\nupdated so that we don't have to\nworry about a lot of that stuff.\n\n27\n00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:29.180\nSo it's not that we can't get hacked it's\nthat it's very very difficult to do it and\n\n28\n00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.090\nas a result attackers usually focus on\n\n29\n00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.860\nwell easier targets which\nthere are plenty of out there.\n\n30\n00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.780\nBut if you take advantage of all\nthe security features available in Mac OS,\n\n31\n00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.910\nyou can have a very stable,\nvery safe operating system,\n\n32\n00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:45.930\nand probably one of the best\nones that's available today.\n\n33\n00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.740\nRight, so let's start off with\none of the features that is\n\n34\n00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.790\nintegrated into the operating system\nthat we're not allowed to mess with and\n\n35\n00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.280\nthat's called application sandboxing.\n\n36\n00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.540\nIn Mac OS Sierra, it implements\napplication sandboxing to ensure that\n\n37\n00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:04.240\none application can't tamper\nwith other applications.\n\n38\n00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:10.140\nThere are a couple of viruses that are out\nthere for Mac OS and almost all of them\n\n39\n00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.880\ntake the form of Trojan horse malware,\nwhere you download one application and\n\n40\n00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.960\nyou run the application, and meanwhile,\nthere's a hitchhiker on board.\n\n41\n00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.110\nThere's a second application,\n\n42\n00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.620\na malicious application, that is\npiggybacked on top of the first one.\n\n43\n00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.350\nAnd by running one, it runs the other,\nand you then infect your system.\n\n44\n00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:29.450\nAnd so there's been a few.\n\n45\n00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:36.210\nThere was the Key Ranger, which was\na ransomware for Mac OS that came out,\n\n46\n00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:40.040\nwhere they had piggybacked it on\nthe transmission bit torrent client, so\n\n47\n00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.450\nif you used transmission as a bit torrent\nclient for a little while you could\n\n48\n00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.750\ndownload that client and it had the key\nrange or ransomware tagged right on to it.\n\n49\n00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.150\nAnd when you ran it, it start encrypting\nyour files kind of a bad thing.\n\n50\n00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:57.150\nSo application sandboxing works to\nfix that to isolate applications,\n\n51\n00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.390\nto keep them separate from each other\nas well as to ensure that only approved\n\n52\n00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.110\napplications run.\n\n53\n00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:05.620\nSome people really really hate this.\n\n54\n00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.190\nBut it's really a great way to\nprovide a lot of security to\n\n55\n00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.080\nensure that our system is protected.\n\n56\n00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.050\nSo let's talk a little\nbit about how that works.\n\n57\n00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:17.470\nFirst off,\napply introduced the Mac OS app store.\n\n58\n00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:18.540\nAnd this is not a new thing.\n\n59\n00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:23.440\nIt's been around for a long time but the\nreason they introduced it was they wanted\n\n60\n00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.700\nto have a place where you could download\napplications where you knew it was safe.\n\n61\n00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:32.220\nThe key ranger attack, the way it worked\nis the transmission bit torrent client was\n\n62\n00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.060\navailable from the transmission website,\nand\n\n63\n00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:39.820\nhackers broke into where the files\nwere stored on the transition website.\n\n64\n00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:43.329\nAnd we're able to modify the files and\nstore them right there, okay?\n\n65\n00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:46.810\nSo they compromise where we got\nthe files from, so Apple said, hey,\n\n66\n00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:51.074\nwe're gonna have an app store, and we're\ngonna control it, so now, if the hackers\n\n67\n00:03:51.074 --> 00:03:55.036\nwant to break in and tamper with files,\nthey'll have to break into Apple, and\n\n68\n00:03:55.036 --> 00:03:59.400\nApple has a lot more money, and a lot more\nresources, than most companies out there.\n\n69\n00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.456\nA lot of the software we run Is\ndeveloped by teams of one, two,\n\n70\n00:04:03.456 --> 00:04:05.173\nmaybe five or six people.\n\n71\n00:04:05.173 --> 00:04:08.488\nThey're not all Microsoft Office,\nwhere they have hundreds of thousands of\n\n72\n00:04:08.488 --> 00:04:11.297\npeople working on it,\na lot of these are very, very small shops.\n\n73\n00:04:11.297 --> 00:04:14.959\nThey don't have the resources behind\nthem to implement the right security,\n\n74\n00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:16.140\nApple does.\n\n75\n00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:19.020\nSo the app store Is their\nimplementation of that.\n\n76\n00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:22.470\nHey, you can download apps right from\nthe app store, and you know they're safe,\n\n77\n00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:23.170\nthey've been checked,\n\n78\n00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:27.860\nif the files are tampered with, they're\nimmediately yanked, and you're protected.\n\n79\n00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.630\nSo that whole key ranger ransomware\n\n80\n00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:33.840\nreally could have been stopped if\nthat client, and I don't even know if\n\n81\n00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.880\ntransmission is available through\nthe app store, it might be.\n\n82\n00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:40.110\nBut if it was pulled from the app store,\nthen it would have been a safe download,\n\n83\n00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:42.840\nand this whole attack wouldn't\nhave happened, right?\n\n84\n00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.610\nNow, there's pros and\n\n85\n00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:49.115\ncons about the app store, but\nthe app store is doing really two things.\n\n86\n00:04:49.115 --> 00:04:51.685\nSo one is the remote side which is\nApple side where they make sure\n\n87\n00:04:51.685 --> 00:04:52.365\nthe apps are safe.\n\n88\n00:04:52.365 --> 00:04:58.015\nAnd the second part is where it integrates\nwith System Integrity Protection,\n\n89\n00:04:58.015 --> 00:04:59.405\nor SIP, S-I-P.\n\n90\n00:04:59.405 --> 00:05:03.985\nSystem Integrity Protection is\na part of the Mac operating\n\n91\n00:05:03.985 --> 00:05:06.235\nsystem that runs under the hood, right?\n\n92\n00:05:06.235 --> 00:05:08.520\nRuns behind what we see on our desktop.\n\n93\n00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:13.190\nAnd it ensures that the system\ndoes not get tampered with.\n\n94\n00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:15.810\nAnd when you download\nan app from the app store,\n\n95\n00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:20.458\nit has to completely conform to\nthe rules that Apple sets apart.\n\n96\n00:05:20.458 --> 00:05:23.570\nNow, l et me tell you what some of those\nrules are and it's kind of easier for\n\n97\n00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:28.670\nme to show you so, I'm gonna take my Mac\nhere and I'm gonna drop to a terminal.\n\n98\n00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:35.740\nNow, with Mac OS, the goal is to make\na easy to use modern operating system.\n\n99\n00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:38.550\nAnd for most people,\nyou can fire up a Mac for the first time,\n\n100\n00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:43.290\nhave you never used a Mac before and you\ncan kind of fumble your way through and\n\n101\n00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:46.640\nfigure things out, its pretty\nintuitive and easy to use interface.\n\n102\n00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:50.540\nSo we normally see the GUI side of things.\n\n103\n00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:53.300\nBut to really see how stuff\nworks under the hood,\n\n104\n00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:55.520\nwe've gotta drop down to\nthe base operating system.\n\n105\n00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:59.630\nUnder the hood, OS X is running BSD.\n\n106\n00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:02.330\nBSD is a Unix-like operating system.\n\n107\n00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:04.720\nAnd when I drop to a terminal like this,\n\n108\n00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:06.765\nI'm dropping down Into\nthat operating system.\n\n109\n00:06:06.765 --> 00:06:09.715\nSo, if you ever hear\nsomebody mention Darwin,\n\n110\n00:06:09.715 --> 00:06:14.695\nDarwin is the bsd Kernel\nthat powers Mac OS.\n\n111\n00:06:14.695 --> 00:06:18.905\nAnd so all this pretty easy-to-use\ngraphical user interface that we work with\n\n112\n00:06:18.905 --> 00:06:22.865\nis running on top of an incredibly\ncomplex network operating system that's\n\n113\n00:06:22.865 --> 00:06:25.120\nactually really, really hard to use.\n\n114\n00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:27.070\nBut you don't see that, right?\n\n115\n00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:30.350\nBut under the hood there's\na lot of files and\n\n116\n00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:33.280\ninformation that's going\non behind the scenes, and\n\n117\n00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:37.850\none of the big areas that we have to worry\nabout is a folder called Applications.\n\n118\n00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:40.680\nAnd the applications folder is where.\n\n119\n00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:42.370\nWell, oddly enough,\nour applications are, right?\n\n120\n00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:44.170\nSo this is where all of\nour programs are stored.\n\n121\n00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:47.630\nSo if I'm running a program,\nI'm gonna use Forklift as an example.\n\n122\n00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:50.050\nSo I run a program called Forklift,\nand I'll find it in here.\n\n123\n00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:52.098\nAnd it is right here.\n\n124\n00:06:52.098 --> 00:06:54.908\nForklift.app, okay.\n\n125\n00:06:54.908 --> 00:06:58.680\nNow, Forklift is a program that is\navailable in the App store, and\n\n126\n00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:00.330\nit's available via the vendor's website.\n\n127\n00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:03.300\nYou can go to either place\nto get the application and\n\n128\n00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:06.710\nthere is a difference which I'll\nexplain here in just a minute.\n\n129\n00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:11.020\nBut the main thing I wanna point\nout here is that by default,\n\n130\n00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:15.660\nfiles that are stored here in\nthe applications folder are protected.\n\n131\n00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:17.190\nAnd when I say they're protected,\n\n132\n00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:20.390\nlet me just pull up this\ndirectory a little but different.\n\n133\n00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:24.380\nAnd what I'm gonna show you here\nare Applications that are downloaded from\n\n134\n00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:28.880\nthe App Store and applications that\nare downloaded directly from a website.\n\n135\n00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:30.300\nSo for example,\n\n136\n00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:35.080\nmy copy of Forklift, I downloaded\nright from the vendor's website.\n\n137\n00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:40.300\nAnd so when I look at the Forklift app,\nnotice who the owner is.\n\n138\n00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:43.590\nThe owner is dpezet, it's me,\nit's my user account.\n\n139\n00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:45.500\nI own the Forklift app.\n\n140\n00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:46.752\nWell, I paid for it, but\n\n141\n00:07:46.752 --> 00:07:50.045\nin this case ownership is in\nreference to the permissions right?\n\n142\n00:07:50.045 --> 00:07:51.270\nI have permissions.\n\n143\n00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:53.002\nI can do whatever I want to this app.\n\n144\n00:07:53.002 --> 00:07:55.819\nI can read, write, and execute it.\n\n145\n00:07:55.819 --> 00:07:58.090\nIf I wanna stick malicious software on it.\n\n146\n00:07:58.090 --> 00:08:00.099\nI can cuz, I own it now.\n\n147\n00:08:00.099 --> 00:08:01.734\nI'd be dumb to do that,\nbut I could, right?\n\n148\n00:08:01.734 --> 00:08:03.097\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Meanwhile,\n\n149\n00:08:03.097 --> 00:08:04.930\nif we take an app like Pixelmator, right?\n\n150\n00:08:04.930 --> 00:08:10.610\nPixelmator is graphics editing software,\nand it's like a poor man's Photoshop.\n\n151\n00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:14.876\nAnd if you look at Pixelmator I bought\nit through the App Store, right?\n\n152\n00:08:14.876 --> 00:08:17.130\nSo, I logged into the Apple App Store.\n\n153\n00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:21.000\nI paid $15 or something like that and\ndownloaded the app.\n\n154\n00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.569\nWell look who owns that one root, okay?\n\n155\n00:08:23.569 --> 00:08:26.856\nRoot is the administrator\naccount that the Kernel uses for\n\n156\n00:08:26.856 --> 00:08:31.753\nperforming all of it's various operations\nare really it's what our operating system\n\n157\n00:08:31.753 --> 00:08:33.309\nuses to access the Kernel.\n\n158\n00:08:33.309 --> 00:08:37.900\nSo that root, that's a very,\nvery low level account that has very,\n\n159\n00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:39.570\nvery high permissions.\n\n160\n00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:42.210\nIt can do anything.\n\n161\n00:08:42.210 --> 00:08:44.590\nI'm not allowed to interact with root.\n\n162\n00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:47.840\nIf I try and modify this file,\nI'm not allowed to.\n\n163\n00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:48.740\nI'm not root.\n\n164\n00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:53.150\nIn fact, I'm gonna fall in this everyone\ngroup where I have read and execute.\n\n165\n00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:55.070\nI can run the app, but\n\n166\n00:08:55.070 --> 00:08:59.390\nI can't change the app, I can't manipulate\nit I don't have those permissions, right?\n\n167\n00:08:59.390 --> 00:09:03.660\nAnd if I start to tamper with it,\nthat's where system integrity protection\n\n168\n00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:07.920\ncomes in,\nSIP will stop me from modifying that file,\n\n169\n00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:10.264\nit will show its damaged,\nand what will the Mac do?\n\n170\n00:09:10.264 --> 00:09:11.730\nIt will re-download it\nfrom the app store and\n\n171\n00:09:11.730 --> 00:09:13.790\nit will fix it again, so it self heals,\n\n172\n00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:18.710\nit fixes the problem or if it can't self\nheal, it just stops the app from running.\n\n173\n00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:22.250\nIt won't let it run cuz it will show\nthat it's been tampered with, right.\n\n174\n00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:24.470\nSo those are protected applications.\n\n175\n00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:29.370\nBut it's not just the application\nthat gets protected, an application,\n\n176\n00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:30.937\nwell you have this .app file,\n\n177\n00:09:30.937 --> 00:09:35.120\nwhich in reality the .app file it's\nnot one file, it's actually a folder.\n\n178\n00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:38.460\nIf I were to change into we'll take\nPixelmator here as an example.\n\n179\n00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:39.695\nThat's a folder, and\n\n180\n00:09:39.695 --> 00:09:43.537\nwhen I go in there, we can start to\nsee what makes up that application.\n\n181\n00:09:43.537 --> 00:09:48.720\nAnd there's a lot of stuff that'll\nbe a part of that application.\n\n182\n00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:52.082\nSo, if I start digging\nreally into this thing.\n\n183\n00:09:52.082 --> 00:09:56.278\nHere's all these like tiff fonts that\nare a part, or actually tiffs are images,\n\n184\n00:09:56.278 --> 00:09:57.480\naren't they?\n\n185\n00:09:57.480 --> 00:10:01.050\nSo here's a bunch of images that are a\npart of it, and all these other files.\n\n186\n00:10:01.050 --> 00:10:03.650\nThis is what actually makes up Pixelmator.\n\n187\n00:10:03.650 --> 00:10:04.968\n&gt;&gt; And\nall of these falls under the protection?\n\n188\n00:10:04.968 --> 00:10:07.310\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; All of it, every bit of it.\n\n189\n00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:10.420\nYeah cuz it, the operating system treating\neverything inside of that .app folder.\n\n190\n00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:12.550\nSo, if I start injecting stuff into this,\n\n191\n00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:15.660\nit's immediately going to\nflag the app as compromised.\n\n192\n00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:18.970\nBut when I run an app,\n\n193\n00:10:18.970 --> 00:10:21.650\napplications are not allowed to\nwrite to the applications folder.\n\n194\n00:10:21.650 --> 00:10:25.590\nOne application cannot modify another\napplication, that's forbidden.\n\n195\n00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:28.270\nSo, applications have to\nstore their data somewhere.\n\n196\n00:10:28.270 --> 00:10:30.200\nAnd there's two places they store data.\n\n197\n00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:33.110\nWell, technically it's one place and\nthere's two copies of it.\n\n198\n00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:35.230\nAnd that is the library folder.\n\n199\n00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:40.480\nThe library folder you can find right off\nof the root of the disk, /Library right?\n\n200\n00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:43.080\nAnd all all of your applications\n\n201\n00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:47.380\nwill store information right\nhere under application support.\n\n202\n00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:51.600\nAnd these settings, these are like\nthe preferences for an application.\n\n203\n00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:57.050\nSo when I go in here, apparently I\nhaven't saved anything from Pixelmator,\n\n204\n00:10:57.050 --> 00:10:59.580\nbut you'll see other things in\nhere that don't have permissions.\n\n205\n00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:01.820\nNow, I have a lot of applications, and\n\n206\n00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:04.975\nI'm always seeing a handful\nof folders here, why is that?\n\n207\n00:11:04.975 --> 00:11:08.420\nWel, I mentioned there were two\ncopies of the library folder.\n\n208\n00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:13.190\nThis library folder that I'm\nin right now is /Library.\n\n209\n00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:16.100\nAnd that's the global library folder.\n\n210\n00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:20.580\nAnything that I change here\naffects every user of this laptop.\n\n211\n00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:23.450\nAnd so, I'm only seeing\na handful of applications here,\n\n212\n00:11:23.450 --> 00:11:25.480\nbecause most applications.\n\n213\n00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:28.810\nTrack separate preferences for each user.\n\n214\n00:11:28.810 --> 00:11:34.400\nSo, if I change into my home directory,\nso I'm gonna get into /Users/dpezet.\n\n215\n00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:37.690\nAnd in my folder,\nI've got a library folder.\n\n216\n00:11:37.690 --> 00:11:40.090\nAnd in there I've got application support.\n\n217\n00:11:41.550 --> 00:11:45.625\nSo I'm in\n/Users/dpezet/Library/Application Support.\n\n218\n00:11:45.625 --> 00:11:49.130\nAnd when I look in there,\nthere's a lot more, right?\n\n219\n00:11:49.130 --> 00:11:52.070\nIn fact, there's forkLift right there.\n\n220\n00:11:52.070 --> 00:11:55.359\nAnd we'll probably find Pixelmator\nhiding in here somewhere, or maybe not.\n\n221\n00:11:55.359 --> 00:11:57.110\nOr, say, you know what?\n\n222\n00:11:57.110 --> 00:11:59.350\nI might not have launched\nPixelmator on this laptop.\n\n223\n00:11:59.350 --> 00:12:00.890\nSo, if you haven't launched it yet,\n\n224\n00:12:00.890 --> 00:12:04.740\nit hasn't had a chance to create its\npreferences and all that good stuff.\n\n225\n00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:06.366\nSo let me just fire it up.\n\n226\n00:12:06.366 --> 00:12:10.061\nIt won't let you do it,\nit's staying in the background.\n\n227\n00:12:10.061 --> 00:12:14.743\nBut basically you'll see where,\nit's right there, all right,\n\n228\n00:12:14.743 --> 00:12:16.550\nits launching there we go.\n\n229\n00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:20.164\nSo, basically, what you'll see is your\napplications are storing their preferences\n\n230\n00:12:20.164 --> 00:12:23.490\nin these folders, and they're doing it\nthat way so that they can be protected.\n\n231\n00:12:23.490 --> 00:12:26.950\nSo that they can be, ensure that they're\nnot tampered with, that they're stored in\n\n232\n00:12:26.950 --> 00:12:31.200\nseparate locations, that my preferences\ncan't interact with Mike's preferences and\n\n233\n00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:32.370\nyou start overwriting things.\n\n234\n00:12:32.370 --> 00:12:35.050\nWe need that isolation,\nthat separation, right?\n\n235\n00:12:35.050 --> 00:12:40.370\nNow, for the most part,\nsandboxing is a really good thing.\n\n236\n00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:42.580\nBut there can be some problems with it,\nright?\n\n237\n00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:46.040\nPreferences are just one of the things\nthat applications like to tamper with.\n\n238\n00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:50.083\nWe wanna change the user\ninterface to be friendly for us or\n\n239\n00:12:50.083 --> 00:12:52.620\nwork the way that we want it to work.\n\n240\n00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:53.960\nThat kind of stuff.\n\n241\n00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:56.840\nBut, there's other things that\napplications might have to\n\n242\n00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:59.520\ntamper with that are a little\nmore deep in the system.\n\n243\n00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:02.570\nWhen we download a video game,\nright, it's just a game.\n\n244\n00:13:02.570 --> 00:13:04.750\nYou play the game,\nit doesn't really change your system.\n\n245\n00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:08.180\nBut there are a lot of utilities\nthat do tamper with the system.\n\n246\n00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:11.690\nThere's advanced clients that\nlet you manage hardware,\n\n247\n00:13:11.690 --> 00:13:14.350\nthat let you connect to\nstorage area networks,\n\n248\n00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:18.470\nor special graphics hardware that\nyou might be adding to your system.\n\n249\n00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:20.260\nYou might need to load drivers for that.\n\n250\n00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:22.940\nAnd drivers are implemented\nat the kernel level.\n\n251\n00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:24.620\nThey're system level applications.\n\n252\n00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:27.720\nAnd that means they can do a lot of\ndamage if they're left unchecked.\n\n253\n00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:30.320\nSo, with system integrity protection,\n\n254\n00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:34.450\nthere's system folders that\nare even more protected.\n\n255\n00:13:34.450 --> 00:13:37.240\nOnes that nobody is\nallowed to tamper with.\n\n256\n00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:40.510\nAnd it's pretty much anything that\ncomes with a default install of\n\n257\n00:13:40.510 --> 00:13:41.790\nthe operating system.\n\n258\n00:13:41.790 --> 00:13:44.540\nWhen you do a default install of MacOS,\n\n259\n00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:47.870\nall of the system folders that\nare created are protected.\n\n260\n00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:49.610\nAnd a lot of them\nare hidden from our view.\n\n261\n00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:52.500\nFor example, if I browse to Macintosh HD.\n\n262\n00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:55.740\nSo, I look at it, here's my hard drive.\n\n263\n00:13:55.740 --> 00:14:01.420\nI see applications, library,\nopt, system, and users.\n\n264\n00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:04.230\nFour of these are Mac specific, right?\n\n265\n00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:06.350\nApplications, that's where my programs go.\n\n266\n00:14:06.350 --> 00:14:10.610\nLibrary, there's where all my support\nfiles for the applications go.\n\n267\n00:14:10.610 --> 00:14:13.020\nSystem, that's where MacOS is.\n\n268\n00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:15.720\nAnd then Users,\nthat's where our user profiles are.\n\n269\n00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:17.970\nSo those are all part of MacOS.\n\n270\n00:14:17.970 --> 00:14:21.090\nOpt well, you may or\nmay not see that one, right?\n\n271\n00:14:21.090 --> 00:14:25.038\nThat's the optional folder, and that's\nactually a UNIX folder, in the UNIX world,\n\n272\n00:14:25.038 --> 00:14:28.446\nwhen you install custom applications,\nthey usually go in the opt folder,\n\n273\n00:14:28.446 --> 00:14:31.470\nthere will be a slash opt slash local,\nor slash opt slash user, and\n\n274\n00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:33.066\nthey'll go in there, all right?\n\n275\n00:14:33.066 --> 00:14:36.602\nI have installed some UNIX software on\nmy laptop, which is why I see that,\n\n276\n00:14:36.602 --> 00:14:40.023\nif you haven't done that on yours,\nyou may not see it, so that one may or\n\n277\n00:14:40.023 --> 00:14:41.300\nmay not show up.\n\n278\n00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:43.551\nWhich is appropriate cuz his name nuptial.\n\n279\n00:14:43.551 --> 00:14:48.570\nNow, but what I'm seeing here is\nactually a filtered view of this.\n\n280\n00:14:48.570 --> 00:14:54.930\nIf I go back to my terminal and\nI'm gonna go into the root folder,\n\n281\n00:14:54.930 --> 00:14:59.020\nright time and just slash the root\nof my Mackintosh hard drive.\n\n282\n00:14:59.020 --> 00:15:02.291\nAnd when I took a look in here,\nthere's a lot of more folders, right?\n\n283\n00:15:02.291 --> 00:15:07.446\nAnd some of these folders are really,\nreally important.\n\n284\n00:15:07.446 --> 00:15:09.849\nSome of these folders are empty, right?\n\n285\n00:15:09.849 --> 00:15:10.973\nSome of them,\n\n286\n00:15:10.973 --> 00:15:16.730\nlike net may not have much in it\nunless I've joined a directory server.\n\n287\n00:15:16.730 --> 00:15:20.450\nIf I am not bound to a directory server,\nthat net folder is probably empty.\n\n288\n00:15:20.450 --> 00:15:24.760\nOther ones are really important,\nlike bin, bin is a binary folder.\n\n289\n00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:28.160\nIt's got the UNIX binaries for\nperforming system operations.\n\n290\n00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:29.780\nIt's stored right in there.\n\n291\n00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:33.090\nDev, that's where we map our devices,\nall of our hardware.\n\n292\n00:15:33.090 --> 00:15:36.910\nWhen you plug in a USB key or connect\na graphics adapter, it's mounted under\n\n293\n00:15:36.910 --> 00:15:40.450\nthe dev folder structure to be able\nto interact with that hardware.\n\n294\n00:15:40.450 --> 00:15:43.970\nETC, that's where our system\nconfiguration is stored.\n\n295\n00:15:43.970 --> 00:15:46.872\nAll the UNIX configuration\nfiles are stuck in there.\n\n296\n00:15:46.872 --> 00:15:51.183\nYou've got other ones that are important\ntoo, like shared binaries or usr,\n\n297\n00:15:51.183 --> 00:15:54.249\nwhich is where user binaries\nend up in user libraries.\n\n298\n00:15:54.249 --> 00:15:57.308\nThese are all things that you\ndo not want To tamper with and\n\n299\n00:15:57.308 --> 00:16:00.624\nyou don't want application to\nbe able to tamper with either,\n\n300\n00:16:00.624 --> 00:16:04.480\nunless you've got one of those\nspecialized applications.\n\n301\n00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:06.650\nLet me give you an example\nof specialized application.\n\n302\n00:16:06.650 --> 00:16:12.520\nSo I use a program called Forklift, and\nForklift if I can get it up on my screen.\n\n303\n00:16:13.610 --> 00:16:15.080\nIs a file manager.\n\n304\n00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:16.580\nAll right.\n\n305\n00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:19.220\nI like Forklift for\na few different reasons.\n\n306\n00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:20.600\nYou could just use the finder.\n\n307\n00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:22.110\nThe finder works fine, but\n\n308\n00:16:22.110 --> 00:16:24.140\nit gives me some features that\nI don't have in the finder.\n\n309\n00:16:24.140 --> 00:16:28.560\nThe main reason I use it is because of\nthis, I get a two pane experience, right?\n\n310\n00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:31.410\nI doubled the pane in this file manager.\n\n311\n00:16:31.410 --> 00:16:33.630\nOn the left side I can be\nnavigating the one folder and\n\n312\n00:16:33.630 --> 00:16:36.710\non the right side I can navigate to\na completely separate folder, right?\n\n313\n00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:40.290\nSo, here I'm in the applications\nfolder on the left and\n\n314\n00:16:40.290 --> 00:16:42.890\nmeanwhile on the right I've\nnavigated into our show notes.\n\n315\n00:16:42.890 --> 00:16:47.000\nAnd so I can move things back and forth or\nwhatever based on what my need is.\n\n316\n00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.260\nIt has a couple other features that\nI like, but one of the main features\n\n317\n00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:53.130\nthat I really like is that it\nconnects to the Cloud storage, so\n\n318\n00:16:53.130 --> 00:16:57.150\nyou'll see I'm connected to\nAmazon S3 storage, right?\n\n319\n00:16:57.150 --> 00:17:00.850\nThat's Cloud storage, and one of\nthe challenges with Cloud storage is it's\n\n320\n00:17:00.850 --> 00:17:02.850\ndifficult to get connected to, right?\n\n321\n00:17:02.850 --> 00:17:06.980\nI don't wanna have to install some\nspecialized client to be able to get to\n\n322\n00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:12.230\nit, I just wanna access it like my normal\nstorage well, that's kinda hard to do.\n\n323\n00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:15.600\nBut inside the Forklift,\nyou actually have this neat feature.\n\n324\n00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:18.205\nAll right, I'm gonna sound\nlike a Forklift salesman here.\n\n325\n00:17:18.205 --> 00:17:19.130\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n326\n00:17:19.130 --> 00:17:22.780\nyou can define your cloud storage and\nyou can mount it as a disk.\n\n327\n00:17:22.780 --> 00:17:26.080\nAnd when you do that, it'll show up\nright alongside your hard drive.\n\n328\n00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:28.580\nJust as a regular disk,\nyou can browse right into it.\n\n329\n00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:31.490\nAnd now, you can treat your cloud\nstorage as if it was local.\n\n330\n00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:35.630\nIt might be SFTP it might be amazon S3 or\ndropbox or\n\n331\n00:17:35.630 --> 00:17:39.370\nsomething else but it just shows\nup like a regular old drive and\n\n332\n00:17:39.370 --> 00:17:42.920\nthat's a really cool function to have\n&gt;&gt; Forklift might want to hire you because\n\n333\n00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:45.004\nI think you sold me.\n\n334\n00:17:45.004 --> 00:17:49.600\n&gt;&gt; So the neat thing here though is\nit's doing it by faking a hard drive and\n\n335\n00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:53.470\nto fake a hard drive, I think system\nintegrity protection would pick that up,\n\n336\n00:17:53.470 --> 00:17:56.358\nwe're having a modified device mapping,\nwhich\n\n337\n00:17:56.358 --> 00:17:59.640\nis something that happens inside a slassh\ndev and we're having to melt the discs and\n\n338\n00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:03.890\nwe're having to upload drivers to handle\nwhat is basically a fake file system\n\n339\n00:18:03.890 --> 00:18:09.000\nbecause you know the S3 is not formatted,\nApple extended journaling or\n\n340\n00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:14.160\nwhatever is going to be just completely\nproprietary so all that has to be hidden.\n\n341\n00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:17.120\nSo how does a developer do that?\n\n342\n00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:21.420\nIf all of this is protected and\nisolated, how do they do that?\n\n343\n00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:26.220\nWell, if you deploy an app through\nthe app store, the answer is simple.\n\n344\n00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:27.050\nYou don't.\n\n345\n00:18:27.050 --> 00:18:30.950\nApple doesn't allow you to\nmess with the system, right?\n\n346\n00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:34.580\nBut if you have\nan Apple Developer account.\n\n347\n00:18:34.580 --> 00:18:37.820\nYou can become an authorised developer and\n\n348\n00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:40.330\nyou can digitally sign\nyour applications so\n\n349\n00:18:40.330 --> 00:18:44.330\nit's got a signature attached to it that\nyou've signed off on but Apple hasn't.\n\n350\n00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:48.160\nAnd if people download your\napplication from your website,\n\n351\n00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:52.440\nnot from the App Store,\nnow it can work around the sandbox,\n\n352\n00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:57.000\nbecause it is digitally signed and you'll\nsee that with applications like Forklift.\n\n353\n00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:58.370\nSo, I just showed you Forklift and\n\n354\n00:18:58.370 --> 00:19:02.700\nI've got that feature to mount to a disk\nright there it's a feature that I use.\n\n355\n00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:07.740\nIf I were to go to the app store and,\nwhoops, that's not the app store.\n\n356\n00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:09.950\nIf I were to go to the app store,\nthere we go.\n\n357\n00:19:09.950 --> 00:19:11.490\nWhen I go to the app store, if I go and\n\n358\n00:19:11.490 --> 00:19:14.570\nfind Forklift,\nlet's just see if we can find it in here.\n\n359\n00:19:14.570 --> 00:19:18.720\nAnd I pull it up, so\nhere's Forklift, right?\n\n360\n00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:21.660\nAnd I start reading a little bit about\nwhat it's saying, blah blah blah,\n\n361\n00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:23.810\nkind of goes through and\nsays all this stuff.\n\n362\n00:19:23.810 --> 00:19:27.120\nThat as we look in there,\nthere's this big note.\n\n363\n00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:31.010\nApp store versions do not\ncontain the Disklet feature and\n\n364\n00:19:31.010 --> 00:19:34.410\ncannot perform privileged file operations.\n\n365\n00:19:34.410 --> 00:19:38.830\nIn other words, if you install\nthe application from the app store\n\n366\n00:19:38.830 --> 00:19:43.220\nsystem integrity projection is\napplying at it's fullest level.\n\n367\n00:19:43.220 --> 00:19:46.450\nAnd this application can't\ndo some of the extra things\n\n368\n00:19:46.450 --> 00:19:48.740\nthat we would do when we\npull it from the website.\n\n369\n00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:50.100\nOkay.\nNow,\n\n370\n00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:52.785\nsome of you right now are probably\nthinking, wow the App Store sucks.\n\n371\n00:19:52.785 --> 00:19:54.870\n[LAUGH] Why would I want to use that.\n\n372\n00:19:54.870 --> 00:19:55.460\nRight.\n\n373\n00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:57.170\nBut don't think of it that way,\nthink it the other way.\n\n374\n00:19:57.170 --> 00:19:59.150\nThink of the good side of this, right.\n\n375\n00:19:59.150 --> 00:20:02.590\nIf I only install apps from the App Store,\n\n376\n00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:08.060\nthen I know that I'm safe, I know that\nnone of my applications are able to\n\n377\n00:20:08.060 --> 00:20:10.050\nperform system operations and\nI'm protected.\n\n378\n00:20:10.050 --> 00:20:14.110\nAnd so yes, I might lose the ability\nto map Amazon S3 as a hard drive.\n\n379\n00:20:14.110 --> 00:20:18.310\nBut you know what,\nthere's other ways to get into S3.\n\n380\n00:20:18.310 --> 00:20:20.450\nI can access it via a web interface.\n\n381\n00:20:20.450 --> 00:20:21.540\nAnd now, I'm safe.\n\n382\n00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:24.430\nSo it's a matter of choosing between\nsafety and convenience, right?\n\n383\n00:20:24.430 --> 00:20:26.148\nAnd in my case I chose convenience.\n\n384\n00:20:26.148 --> 00:20:27.950\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But you know,\n\n385\n00:20:27.950 --> 00:20:30.390\nit's up to you how you\nwanna go about that.\n\n386\n00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:32.770\nBut that's what system integrity\nprotection's all about.\n\n387\n00:20:32.770 --> 00:20:36.240\nNow, unfortunately there's several\ndevelopers who start pulling their apps\n\n388\n00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:40.460\nfrom the app store, saying,\nhey if I can't have all of my features.\n\n389\n00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:42.060\nThen why will I distribute this way.\n\n390\n00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:46.390\nAnd now there is this schism where\nsometimes you need an app and\n\n391\n00:20:47.850 --> 00:20:50.060\nthe only place you can get it\nis from the Vendor Website.\n\n392\n00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:51.720\nSo it starts to hurt\nsecurity a little bit.\n\n393\n00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:53.970\nI think we will see that shake\nup over the next few years.\n\n394\n00:20:53.970 --> 00:20:56.350\nBut know that it is system\nintegrate protection that has that.\n\n395\n00:20:56.350 --> 00:20:58.490\nThere are other applications\nlike Pixometer though.\n\n396\n00:20:58.490 --> 00:21:03.040\nWhere it doesn't need to modify\nyour operating system or\n\n397\n00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:05.300\nor whatever just so you can add a graphic.\n\n398\n00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:08.440\nAnd so it's only available via\nthe App Store, and that's perfectly fine!\n\n399\n00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:11.240\nYou get all the functionality you want,\nand that's a great way to get it and\n\n400\n00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:12.130\nhave it available.\n\n401\n00:21:12.130 --> 00:21:15.980\nSo, there's two different sides to the App\nStore that we need to be aware of, but\n\n402\n00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:18.540\nit's all system integrity\nprotection that's driving that.\n\n403\n00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:20.360\nAll right.\n\n404\n00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:23.400\nUnderstand that if you're a developer,\nyou can digitally sign your own apps.\n\n405\n00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:26.760\nAnd when you do that,\nthat's going to be making sure that\n\n406\n00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:29.080\nthey're able to be installed,\nand your digital signature,\n\n407\n00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:32.880\nif somebody tampers with the app,\nthe signature will be invalidated.\n\n408\n00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:35.600\nIn theory, there are ways around that,\nwhich is kind of what we saw with\n\n409\n00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:38.150\nthe transmission exploit, so\nyou always have to be careful with that.\n\n410\n00:21:39.670 --> 00:21:42.270\nAlright, couple other little odds and\n\n411\n00:21:42.270 --> 00:21:44.980\nends here that I wanna throw i here that\nfall under system integrity protection.\n\n412\n00:21:46.460 --> 00:21:48.750\nMac OS does some really crazy stuff\n\n413\n00:21:48.750 --> 00:21:49.430\nin the background\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n414\n00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:50.200\n&gt;&gt; To help protect you.\n\n415\n00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:53.165\nStuff that you don't even know about Know\nabout that you don't need to know about,\n\n416\n00:21:53.165 --> 00:21:55.305\nwell, unless you're gonna take and\npass this test.\n\n417\n00:21:55.305 --> 00:21:57.415\nBut in real life, we take it for granted.\n\n418\n00:21:57.415 --> 00:22:01.625\nA lot of people take it for granted\nwhat all Mac OS does in the background.\n\n419\n00:22:01.625 --> 00:22:05.210\nOne thing that it does that's really neat\nis something called library randomization.\n\n420\n00:22:05.210 --> 00:22:07.870\nWhen I fire up MacOS or when you do and\n\n421\n00:22:07.870 --> 00:22:12.550\nyou new launch an application, there's all\nthese libraries and what libraries are,\n\n422\n00:22:12.550 --> 00:22:16.040\nare basically,\nthink of them as shared code, right?\n\n423\n00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:17.800\nIf you're a developer and\nyou wanna write an application,\n\n424\n00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:21.860\nyou wanna put a button on your screen\nare you the first person to ever coming up\n\n425\n00:22:21.860 --> 00:22:23.760\nwith the idea of putting\na button in your application?\n\n426\n00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:24.275\n&gt;&gt; I don't think so.\n\n427\n00:22:24.275 --> 00:22:26.000\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, very unlikely.\n\n428\n00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:27.890\nWhat about a radio button or\na drop down box?\n\n429\n00:22:27.890 --> 00:22:29.770\n&gt;&gt; Now that's something\nthat I've never seen.\n\n430\n00:22:29.770 --> 00:22:30.640\n&gt;&gt; Let's get wild here.\n\n431\n00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:32.770\nNo, other people have done it, right?\n\n432\n00:22:32.770 --> 00:22:35.430\nYou're application might be unique.\n\n433\n00:22:35.430 --> 00:22:37.330\nBut the interface for the application or\n\n434\n00:22:37.330 --> 00:22:41.010\nthe tasks it performs behind the scene,\nthose are things other people have done.\n\n435\n00:22:41.010 --> 00:22:46.500\nAnd so with libraries, they take this\ncode that's easily reusable and they\n\n436\n00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:50.250\nput it in a place where it can be shared,\nwhere multiple applications can use it.\n\n437\n00:22:50.250 --> 00:22:50.890\nRight?\n\n438\n00:22:50.890 --> 00:22:53.490\nAnd so, now when I wanna render a button\nI don't have to write a button code\n\n439\n00:22:53.490 --> 00:22:53.990\nfrom scratch.\n\n440\n00:22:53.990 --> 00:22:56.040\nI can just call this library who's\nalready got the button, right?\n\n441\n00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:58.980\nOr if I want talk to the network card or\ndo a DNS look up,\n\n442\n00:22:58.980 --> 00:22:59.880\nI don't have to figure that out.\n\n443\n00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:00.900\nI can just talk to this library.\n\n444\n00:23:01.990 --> 00:23:04.810\nBut, let's say I know that's how it works.\n\n445\n00:23:04.810 --> 00:23:09.020\nLet's say I wanna perform some kind of DNS\npoisoning and I know that anytime somebody\n\n446\n00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:11.052\ndoes a DNS look up they're\npulling on a network library and\n\n447\n00:23:11.052 --> 00:23:14.480\ngetting it, what if I tampered\nwith the network library.\n\n448\n00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:17.740\n&gt;&gt; Maybe redirect where they're going for\ntheir DNS queries.\n\n449\n00:23:17.740 --> 00:23:21.920\n&gt;&gt; And not just for one app but for every\napp that would be the perfect target.\n\n450\n00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:25.500\nWell, the library on disk is protected so\nI don't have to worry about that.\n\n451\n00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:28.180\nIf somebody tries to tamper with\nthe library on disk it is not gonna work,\n\n452\n00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:29.900\nsystem integrity protector will stop that.\n\n453\n00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:32.230\nBut libraries aren't\nusually run from disk.\n\n454\n00:23:32.230 --> 00:23:33.770\nThey're taken from disk and\nloaded into RAM.\n\n455\n00:23:33.770 --> 00:23:35.400\nAnd they're stored in RAM.\n\n456\n00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:39.190\nSo what if the attacker gets really smart\nand says, hey, I'm gonna attack it in RAM.\n\n457\n00:23:39.190 --> 00:23:41.040\nThese are the memory\naddresses I need to look for\n\n458\n00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:42.980\nto reach out and hit that library.\n\n459\n00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:44.950\nWell, they could do that.\n\n460\n00:23:44.950 --> 00:23:49.590\nSo what Apple does is anytime a library is\nloaded, they randomized it's addressing.\n\n461\n00:23:49.590 --> 00:23:51.220\nIt gets stored at a different place.\n\n462\n00:23:51.220 --> 00:23:54.389\nAnd so it's, I don't wanna say it's\nnever stored in the same place twice,\n\n463\n00:23:54.389 --> 00:23:56.430\nyou only have so much memory so\neventually it is.\n\n464\n00:23:56.430 --> 00:24:00.278\nBut each time a library is loaded,\nit's loaded in a different place.\n\n465\n00:24:00.278 --> 00:24:02.700\nAnd that makes it very difficult for\nan attacker to target.\n\n466\n00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:05.380\nAnd it's not just libraries,\neven the kernel is done that way,\n\n467\n00:24:05.380 --> 00:24:08.520\nthe kernel itself, which is incredibly\ndifficult to tamper with anyway.\n\n468\n00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:11.620\nBut better safe then sorry,\nApple takes that extra step and\n\n469\n00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:12.780\nmakes sure that that's being randomized.\n\n470\n00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:15.560\nSo library randomization,\nit's not something we have to turn on.\n\n471\n00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:17.050\nIt's not even something\nI can really show you.\n\n472\n00:24:17.050 --> 00:24:19.490\nIt's just something that\nhappens in the background,\n\n473\n00:24:19.490 --> 00:24:21.490\nit is an extra step\nprotecting us from attackers.\n\n474\n00:24:22.990 --> 00:24:24.385\nAnd then the last one I wanna mention,\n\n475\n00:24:24.385 --> 00:24:26.358\nis actually a function of your processor,\nyour CPU.\n\n476\n00:24:26.358 --> 00:24:31.736\nThere's a function in Intel processors,\ncalled execute disable, right.\n\n477\n00:24:31.736 --> 00:24:33.886\nAnd sometimes it's called\nthe no execute bit, but\n\n478\n00:24:33.886 --> 00:24:36.370\nexecute disables what\nit's actually called.\n\n479\n00:24:36.370 --> 00:24:39.370\nAnd, what it does is it\nsays when a program runs,\n\n480\n00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:45.686\na program is expected to access\na certain area of memory.\n\n481\n00:24:45.686 --> 00:24:46.800\nAnd there's other areas of memory that\na program is not expected to access.\n\n482\n00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:48.750\nLike where our kernel's running from.\n\n483\n00:24:48.750 --> 00:24:51.210\nAnd so the processor can recognize that.\n\n484\n00:24:51.210 --> 00:24:56.530\nAnd when an application tries to\nexecute code in the wrong memory space,\n\n485\n00:24:56.530 --> 00:25:00.550\nit can stop that, it can disable\nthe executor, do a no execute.\n\n486\n00:25:00.550 --> 00:25:04.510\nAnd prevent an application from reaching\ninto another application's memory space.\n\n487\n00:25:04.510 --> 00:25:07.770\nNow, that should never happen anyway,\nright?\n\n488\n00:25:07.770 --> 00:25:11.200\nBut attackers love to do\nbuffer overflow attacks.\n\n489\n00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:15.960\nAnd buffer overflow are where they throw\nso much junk into memory that it fills up\n\n490\n00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:19.660\nthe memory assigned to an application, and\nit overflows into the next application.\n\n491\n00:25:19.660 --> 00:25:22.760\nAnd that's when they might be able\nto overflow into the kernel or\n\n492\n00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:25.450\nsome of the privileged space and\ngain higher privileges.\n\n493\n00:25:25.450 --> 00:25:30.210\nWhile your CPU can stop that, assuming\nthat your Operating System is aware.\n\n494\n00:25:30.210 --> 00:25:35.140\nAnd Mac OS is fully aware, and Apple\nonly uses Intel processors, so it's got\n\n495\n00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:38.920\nthat functionality baked in and that's\nanother one we can take advantage of.\n\n496\n00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:42.992\nWe don't turn it on or turn it off, right,\nyou usually see it on a regular computer,\n\n497\n00:25:42.992 --> 00:25:45.810\nlike a Windows machine,\nyou'd see it as a BIOS option.\n\n498\n00:25:45.810 --> 00:25:48.490\nBut on a Mac you don't\nhave access to the BIOS.\n\n499\n00:25:48.490 --> 00:25:51.160\nIt's enabled, it's turned on,\nthere's no way to disable it.\n\n500\n00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:53.460\nAnd it's protecting you\non a regular basis.\n\n501\n00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:57.610\nSo, system integrity protection,\nlibrary randomization,\n\n502\n00:25:57.610 --> 00:25:59.460\nthe execute disable functionality.\n\n503\n00:25:59.460 --> 00:26:02.660\nThese are all things that are working\nbehind the scenes to protect us.\n\n504\n00:26:02.660 --> 00:26:06.060\nAnd, I didn't show you guys a single\nconfiguration command this whole episode.\n\n505\n00:26:06.060 --> 00:26:07.860\nWe dont' have to turn them on,\nthey're just running, they're there,\n\n506\n00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:10.200\nand they protect us and make it safer.\n\n507\n00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:13.080\n&gt;&gt; All right Don, fantastic look\nat some of the security features\n\n508\n00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:17.360\nbuilt into Mac OS that, as you said,\nare just there helping keep us safe.\n\n509\n00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:21.690\nSo we appreciate that great explanation\nof how it uses the sandboxing and\n\n510\n00:26:21.690 --> 00:26:24.530\nthe system integrity\nprotection to keep us safe.\n\n511\n00:26:24.530 --> 00:26:25.320\nSo we thank you for that.\n\n512\n00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:27.640\nWe hope everybody out there\nenjoyed watching this one.\n\n513\n00:26:27.640 -->

00:00:08.220\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.640\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.430\n&gt;&gt; Hello, welcome to another\nexciting episode here at ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:19.190\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick and today\nwe're doing our Mac integration basics.\n\n7\n00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:24.320\nAnd specifically in this episode, we're\ngonna be looking at our security features.\n\n8\n00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.218\nAnd here to help us with\nthat is Mr Don Pezet.\n\n9\n00:00:26.218 --> 00:00:27.595\nWelcome back, Don.\n\n10\n00:00:27.595 --> 00:00:28.505\n&gt;&gt; Welcome back, Mike.\n\n11\n00:00:28.505 --> 00:00:31.355\nI'm ready to jump right back\ninto the hole, security world.\n\n12\n00:00:31.355 --> 00:00:33.825\nWe got a lot of security topics to cover.\n\n13\n00:00:33.825 --> 00:00:37.231\nSo, it's just a ton of neat little\nadd ons, little pieces that\n\n14\n00:00:37.231 --> 00:00:41.170\nare part of Mac OS that all together\ncreate a really secure environment.\n\n15\n00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:42.994\nWe got to see a couple of\nthose in part one, but\n\n16\n00:00:42.994 --> 00:00:44.638\nnow we're gonna pick up with a few more.\n\n17\n00:00:44.638 --> 00:00:47.570\nAnd we're gonna start with\nsomething that is kind of important\n\n18\n00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:48.846\nwhich is password security.\n\n19\n00:00:48.846 --> 00:00:49.931\n&gt;&gt; Right, that's very important.\n\n20\n00:00:49.931 --> 00:00:54.568\n&gt;&gt; I mention it here because, Macs, Apples\nin general, one of their marketing angles\n\n21\n00:00:54.568 --> 00:00:57.590\nis the fact that their devices\nare easy to use you know?\n\n22\n00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:01.178\nIf you get an iPod, or\nan iPhone, an iPad, an iMac,\n\n23\n00:01:01.178 --> 00:01:06.410\na MacBook, they're all designed\nto be super easy and convenient.\n\n24\n00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:09.068\nWell, what is easy and\nconvenient about typing in a password?\n\n25\n00:01:09.068 --> 00:01:10.464\n&gt;&gt; Nothing.\n&gt;&gt; Nothing.\n\n26\n00:01:10.464 --> 00:01:12.000\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, for a lot of people,\n\n27\n00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.150\nwhen they get a new MacBook Air or\nMacBook Pro or\n\n28\n00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.240\nwhatever and\nthey run through that initial setup, and\n\n29\n00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.470\nthey see the password is optional,\nthey might not set a password.\n\n30\n00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.093\nOr they set a password but\nthen they turn on automatic log on, so\n\n31\n00:01:25.093 --> 00:01:28.181\nthat when they turn on their computer,\nit just immediately logs them in.\n\n32\n00:01:28.181 --> 00:01:31.590\nAll right, well,\nthat can be a problem, right?\n\n33\n00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.930\nIf you lose your laptop, if I leave\nit on a cab, and somebody gets it and\n\n34\n00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:37.110\nopens it up at auto logs in,\n\n35\n00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.510\nthat's gonna give somebody access to your\nsystem and potentially access your files.\n\n36\n00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:46.250\nSo, we generally, wants to make sure\nthat we have a password set and\n\n37\n00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.350\nthen it's a strong password,\nnot an easy one to guess.\n\n38\n00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.500\nThat is not password one, two, three.\n\n39\n00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.600\nOr what Mike use is one, two, three, four\nor just your, [LAUGH] pause the video or\n\n40\n00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.112\nour birthday that you people know\nyour birthday, if you celebrate it.\n\n41\n00:02:01.112 --> 00:02:03.628\nSo, those are things\nthat people can guess.\n\n42\n00:02:03.628 --> 00:02:05.880\nAnd we wanna make sure that we have\nstrong passwords that are hard for\n\n43\n00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.020\npeople to guess.\n\n44\n00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.520\nAnd so to help with that, Apple has\na feature called the Password Assistant.\n\n45\n00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.280\nAnd the Password Assistant helps you\nto generate a password that is secure.\n\n46\n00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.240\nAnd, it usually, I'm gonna say,\nusually shows up,\n\n47\n00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:18.569\nit shows up in the important places.\n\n48\n00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:21.890\nIt shows up when you're assigning\na password to a user account.\n\n49\n00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.100\nBut it also shows up in a number of\nother password fields throughout macOS.\n\n50\n00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.230\nSo, anytime you go to get to a field\nwhere you're generating a password,\n\n51\n00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.740\nyou may see a special little key icon,\n\n52\n00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.810\nit's letting you know the password\nassistant is ready to help you.\n\n53\n00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.520\nLet me show you one user account.\n\n54\n00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.880\nSo I'm gonna go into my\nSystem Preferences, and\n\n55\n00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.650\nI'm gonna dig into my Users and\nGroups, right?\n\n56\n00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.760\nSo when I go into Users and\nGroups, I'll see all the users and\n\n57\n00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.060\ngroups here on my system.\n\n58\n00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.591\nAnd, if I wanna make any changes,\nhere I need to unlock it.\n\n59\n00:02:47.591 --> 00:02:52.420\nAnd actually, that's a good, well,\nI gotta remember my password here.\n\n60\n00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.581\nBut, a good thing to point out is, even if\nyour user account is set to auto log in,\n\n61\n00:02:56.581 --> 00:03:00.318\nwhen you perform an administrative task,\nyou do still have to unlock and\n\n62\n00:03:00.318 --> 00:03:01.710\nprovide a password.\n\n63\n00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:05.360\nSo that automated log in, isn't\nnecessarily gonna compromise the safety of\n\n64\n00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.280\nyour system, but it will compromise\nthe safety of your data, right.\n\n65\n00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.560\nSomebody could turn on your laptop,\nit automatically logs you in, and\n\n66\n00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.100\nnow they can get to your\ndocuments folder and\n\n67\n00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.610\nthey can save it all to a USB key and\nwalk away with your data, right?\n\n68\n00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:18.810\nBut, they wouldn't be able to come in and\n\n69\n00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.570\nreset the password of an account,\nunless they had your password.\n\n70\n00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:24.810\nSo there's that,\nunless you left your password empty,\n\n71\n00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.950\nif you didn't have a password, in which\ncase then you'd have a bigger problem.\n\n72\n00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:29.200\nSo if I wanna take a user though,\n\n73\n00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.360\nI'll take somebody like old\nChristopher Walkin here, and this user,\n\n74\n00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.580\nI can reset their password, and\nI can assign a password to them.\n\n75\n00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:40.350\nAnd usually, we just type in whatever\nthat password is gonna be and\n\n76\n00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:42.200\nmaybe we put in a hint or maybe we don't.\n\n77\n00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.200\nI generally don't put\na hint on my accounts, but\n\n78\n00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.320\nyou might wanna have to put\none out to help you remember.\n\n79\n00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:50.000\nRemember that a password hint\nnot only helps you remember, but\n\n80\n00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.870\nhelps an attacker guess, right?\n\n81\n00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:53.490\nSo it needs to be a cryptic hint,\n\n82\n00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:56.340\nwhich in my opinion at that point\nyou might as well not have.\n\n83\n00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:57.044\nSo, that's up to you.\n\n84\n00:03:57.044 --> 00:03:57.962\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n85\n00:03:57.962 --> 00:03:59.795\nthis key icon that's what\nI really wanna talk about.\n\n86\n00:03:59.795 --> 00:04:03.580\nThat key icon is the Password Assistant.\n\n87\n00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:08.033\nAnd when you hit it, it launches this\nlittle window down here, which is well,\n\n88\n00:04:08.033 --> 00:04:11.550\nthe Password Assistant and\nit helps you generate a password.\n\n89\n00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:15.620\nAnd there's several different\nways it can generate a password,\n\n90\n00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:18.590\nthe default is called Memorable.\n\n91\n00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:21.390\nMemorable is where it takes\na couple of words and\n\n92\n00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:24.340\nit strings together a few\nspecial characters in it to\n\n93\n00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:29.240\ncreate something that is complex but\neasy to remember, right?\n\n94\n00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:33.926\nSo here roses3, looks like a quote\nmark and then jives, so roses3\"jives,\n\n95\n00:04:33.926 --> 00:04:36.626\nall right', that's not hard to remember.\n\n96\n00:04:36.626 --> 00:04:37.764\n&gt;&gt; Not too bad.\n\n97\n00:04:37.764 --> 00:04:39.890\nYeah, yeah the four things it'll\nbe like remembering four letters,\n\n98\n00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:40.656\nit's pretty easy to do.\n\n99\n00:04:40.656 --> 00:04:44.725\nNow these are dictionary words, so\nin theory a dictionary attack might get it\n\n100\n00:04:44.725 --> 00:04:47.980\nbut the special characters\nin the middle help.\n\n101\n00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:52.370\nThis password though isn't necessarily\nas strong as we'd like to see, right?\n\n102\n00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:54.330\nThe official Apple recommendation,\n\n103\n00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:58.330\nthe one you'll see on the exam\nis at least eight characters.\n\n104\n00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:01.145\nWell, we've got more than eight\ncharacters here so, we're good.\n\n105\n00:05:01.145 --> 00:05:04.855\nAt least one upper case and\none lower case character.\n\n106\n00:05:04.855 --> 00:05:06.655\nWell, that's where this one breaks down,\nright,\n\n107\n00:05:06.655 --> 00:05:10.015\nthere's no uppercase characters in here,\nit's all lower case.\n\n108\n00:05:10.015 --> 00:05:13.867\nSo we might need to modify that if we\nneeded to meet our recommendations.\n\n109\n00:05:13.867 --> 00:05:17.279\nAt least one number, we've got 3,\nand at least one special character,\n\n110\n00:05:17.279 --> 00:05:19.010\nwe've got a quote mark, all right?\n\n111\n00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:23.420\nSo, it's generating a password here and\nsuggesting it to me.\n\n112\n00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:27.860\nAnd, if I wanna modify that, it's gonna\nrank the quality here to determine\n\n113\n00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:30.620\nwhether it's a better or\na weaker password.\n\n114\n00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:34.820\nNow, this little Quality marker here,\nnotice how it's just saying Entropy 0.0.\n\n115\n00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:37.740\nIt's not actually measuring anything\nright now, cuz it's auto generated.\n\n116\n00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:41.880\nBut if I start to modify the password,\nnow it generates, right?\n\n117\n00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:45.660\nAnd so I can see that, I've got\na certain level of entropy now, 79.4.\n\n118\n00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:51.820\nAnd if I go back and I take something out,\nlike if I just did rosesjives.\n\n119\n00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:54.650\nSee how my score dropped way low and\n\n120\n00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:57.291\nit did that because now I\njust got two dictionary word.\n\n121\n00:05:57.291 --> 00:06:01.870\nThat can be brute forced, somebody can\nguess that with a multiple attempt,\n\n122\n00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:03.360\nit's not that hard.\n\n123\n00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:07.250\nBut the moment we added that number in,\nthat number,\n\n124\n00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:09.780\nthat quality number jumped quite a bit,\nright?\n\n125\n00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:12.402\nI went from 13 to 56.9.\n\n126\n00:06:12.402 --> 00:06:17.660\nAnd then when we added the \" mark in,\nnow we've gone even higher to 73.3.\n\n127\n00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:22.360\nWell, the more complexity you introduce,\nthe stronger this is getting.\n\n128\n00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:24.590\nSee how that numbers\nkinda continues to go up?\n\n129\n00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:28.557\nThere is a diminishing return at one\npoint where it won't get stronger\n\n130\n00:06:28.557 --> 00:06:29.640\nanymore, right?\n\n131\n00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:31.890\nWhere it's just like, hey,\nyou're passwords strong enough.\n\n132\n00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:34.970\nBut, the point is here, that you\nwanna create a strong password that\n\n133\n00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:37.350\nmeets the needs of you and\nyour organization.\n\n134\n00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:38.610\nYou want it to be secure.\n\n135\n00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:41.500\nBut not so\nsecure that you can't remember it.\n\n136\n00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:42.970\nNow, Memorable is one way,\n\n137\n00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:45.675\nsee how it changed to Manual\nnow cuz I messed with it.\n\n138\n00:06:45.675 --> 00:06:46.380\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n139\n00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:49.536\n&gt;&gt; If you drop that box down,\nyou'll see there's other ones too, right,\n\n140\n00:06:49.536 --> 00:06:51.430\nlike Letters &amp; Numbers.\n\n141\n00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:55.000\nLetters and numbers are nice cuz,\nwell, they're letters and numbers,\n\n142\n00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.590\nright, no special characters.\n\n143\n00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:00.640\nWell, you can still get a strong\npassword without special characters.\n\n144\n00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:02.940\nYou just have to have a lot of them,\nright?\n\n145\n00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:06.160\nAnd try and have true randomness,\nwhich is hard for humans to do.\n\n146\n00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:09.520\nSo, here it's a pretty strong password,\neven though it has no special characters.\n\n147\n00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:12.590\nIf I stuck even one special character\non there, though, it would help.\n\n148\n00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:15.810\nBut without that, it's still\na certain degree of strength, right?\n\n149\n00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:19.040\nThere's capital and or\nuppercase and lowercase letters.\n\n150\n00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:22.370\nThere's numbers, so this is really just\nmissing the special characters item.\n\n151\n00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:25.667\n&gt;&gt; But\nnot really easy to remember on that one.\n\n152\n00:07:25.667 --> 00:07:26.805\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No, this is one that would end up on\n\n153\n00:07:26.805 --> 00:07:27.993\na Post-it notes stuck to your monitor.\n\n154\n00:07:27.993 --> 00:07:30.068\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So, all right,\n\n155\n00:07:30.068 --> 00:07:32.800\nif we drop that down,\nthen you'll see there's Numbers Only.\n\n156\n00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:36.865\nNotice with Numbers Only, it really\ndidn't get a good strength, right,\n\n157\n00:07:36.865 --> 00:07:39.136\nbecause numbers are easy to brute force.\n\n158\n00:07:39.136 --> 00:07:43.276\nThey can start with 1, and then 2,\nand then 3, and then 4 and\n\n159\n00:07:43.276 --> 00:07:47.960\nafter enough attempts eventually,\nthey come across whatever this is,\n\n160\n00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:50.670\n77 trillion 808 billion whatever.\n\n161\n00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:53.020\nSo, it would take them a while,\nbut they'd get there eventually.\n\n162\n00:07:54.632 --> 00:07:59.473\nAll right, we have Random, which is\ntrying to achieve true randomness.\n\n163\n00:07:59.473 --> 00:08:00.867\nAll letters, all numbers,\n\n164\n00:08:00.867 --> 00:08:03.897\nall special characters are involved\nhere in being rendered.\n\n165\n00:08:03.897 --> 00:08:07.260\nNow When we look at this,\nthere was one that was numbers only,\n\n166\n00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:11.270\nversus this one that has letters and,\nI'm sorry, it was numbers only but\n\n167\n00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:14.650\nwe also saw letters and\nnumbers without special characters.\n\n168\n00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:16.707\nAnd here we have a lot\nof special characters.\n\n169\n00:08:16.707 --> 00:08:18.880\nWhy the hate for special characters?\n\n170\n00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:21.400\nWell, special characters\nare hard to remember, right?\n\n171\n00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:24.240\nRemember the roses 3 jives,\nthat's easy to say.\n\n172\n00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:27.310\nHow about roses 3 quote mark jives.\n\n173\n00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:31.303\nOr I'm sure there's some official name for\nthe quote mark.\n\n174\n00:08:31.303 --> 00:08:34.890\nBut, anyhow it just doesn't flow off\nthe tongue, it hard to remember.\n\n175\n00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:38.400\n&gt;&gt; Also thinking about entering them in\non certain devices can be challenging.\n\n176\n00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:41.070\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely and\nnot only entering them in, like so\n\n177\n00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:45.100\non a iPhone keyboard, you might have\nto change the alternate keyboard and\n\n178\n00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:49.060\nthen change the second alternate screen\nbefore you get to the percent sign or\n\n179\n00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:50.460\nwhatever that can be a challenge.\n\n180\n00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:53.340\nBut also some software like\nwhen you got to websites,\n\n181\n00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:56.690\nsome websites might not allow you to use\nthings like the parenthesis character,\n\n182\n00:08:56.690 --> 00:08:59.490\nbecause they might think that you're\ndoing a SQL injection attack.\n\n183\n00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:01.540\nThat might get sanitized out\nof the password field or\n\n184\n00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:03.430\nwhatever, it shouldn't but it does happen.\n\n185\n00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:06.560\nSo, sometimes special\ncharacters can cause problems.\n\n186\n00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:08.028\nBut boy do they generate secure passwords.\n\n187\n00:09:08.028 --> 00:09:12.256\n[LAUGH] Really, really difficult to\nguess these because they don't match\n\n188\n00:09:12.256 --> 00:09:16.100\na dictionary word anymore and\nnow they're very very challenging, right?\n\n189\n00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:18.020\nYou can get a high entropy level.\n\n190\n00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:21.940\nNow the one that I get the biggest kick\nout of though, is if I drop down random\n\n191\n00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:27.308\nand I choose the next one,\nFIPS-181 compliant, all right?\n\n192\n00:09:27.308 --> 00:09:30.965\nFIPS is one of our U.S.\nfederal government programs.\n\n193\n00:09:30.965 --> 00:09:32.197\nThat helps companies and\n\n194\n00:09:32.197 --> 00:09:35.901\norganizations develop a minimum level\nof security that they need to meet.\n\n195\n00:09:35.901 --> 00:09:40.162\nAnd so FIPS-181 compliance requires that\nyou have a password of a certain length\n\n196\n00:09:40.162 --> 00:09:41.550\nand a certain complexity.\n\n197\n00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:44.025\nAnd so by choosing that it'll\ngenerate you a password.\n\n198\n00:09:44.025 --> 00:09:49.665\nBut if you look at the password it's all\nlower case letters and that's it right.\n\n199\n00:09:49.665 --> 00:09:54.372\nSo you have 26 possible characters for\neach character.\n\n200\n00:09:54.372 --> 00:09:56.111\nOr 26 values for\neach character there we go.\n\n201\n00:09:56.111 --> 00:09:57.366\nThat's how I should have said that.\n\n202\n00:09:57.366 --> 00:10:00.708\nAnd so that means this is\nextremely easy to brute force,\n\n203\n00:10:00.708 --> 00:10:03.136\nbut you'll be 681 compliant right?\n\n204\n00:10:03.136 --> 00:10:06.800\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So\nit's not really truly viable anymore.\n\n205\n00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:10.620\nThis was made back in a Safer\nworld I guess I don't know.\n\n206\n00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:12.560\nAnd these passwords\nare really hard to remember.\n\n207\n00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:17.310\nI guess maybe you could try and make some\nkinda word out of this, like dewyonwuwnec.\n\n208\n00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:20.519\nSo when I log in every day,\nI'm gonna log in as dewyonwuwnec.\n\n209\n00:10:20.519 --> 00:10:23.588\nWhich If that's your name on there,\n\n210\n00:10:23.588 --> 00:10:26.495\nsorry but, [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You might be able to make something out\n\n211\n00:10:26.495 --> 00:10:27.060\nof it like that.\n\n212\n00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:30.800\nBut it's just not, even for\na long password, its got low entropy.\n\n213\n00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:33.811\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I was gonna say it's a lot of\ntyping, it's difficult to remember and\n\n214\n00:10:33.811 --> 00:10:35.660\nstill doesn't give me\nthat much protection.\n\n215\n00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:39.000\n&gt;&gt; Right and know that you\ncan tweak all of these right?\n\n216\n00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.400\nSo, I can tweak the length\nright here with this slider.\n\n217\n00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:44.380\nSo I can bump it up and say,\nnah I need 18 characters or\n\n218\n00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:45.940\nwhatever if you wanna go crazy.\n\n219\n00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:50.067\nAnd I could have done that with any\nof them so if I did truly random and\n\n220\n00:10:50.067 --> 00:10:54.489\nbumped it up to 18, you can get a high\nlevel of entropy right there, so\n\n221\n00:10:54.489 --> 00:10:57.010\nyou can generate what you need.\n\n222\n00:10:57.010 --> 00:11:00.561\nThe other thing is under the Suggestion if\nyou hit the drop-down box, I think I've\n\n223\n00:11:00.561 --> 00:11:04.022\ndone it a few times by accident so far It\ngenerates more than one password for you.\n\n224\n00:11:04.022 --> 00:11:05.902\nSo if you don't like\nthe first one that you get,\n\n225\n00:11:05.902 --> 00:11:09.110\nyou can try another one that's\nreally useful and memorable.\n\n226\n00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:15.368\nBecause you might get one\nlike this paddock8086#traded.\n\n227\n00:11:15.368 --> 00:11:18.334\nLet me move that back down to\n12 characters there we go.\n\n228\n00:11:18.334 --> 00:11:19.830\nWell, this one's got\na capital letter in it.\n\n229\n00:11:19.830 --> 00:11:20.935\nThis one's a little bit better.\n\n230\n00:11:20.935 --> 00:11:23.132\nCole79@mates.\n\n231\n00:11:23.132 --> 00:11:27.317\nAll right, [CROSSTALK] But if you don't\nlike it you hit your down arrow and\n\n232\n00:11:27.317 --> 00:11:31.297\nnow you get a bunch of other ones\nthat are out there baa76#Downey,\n\n233\n00:11:31.297 --> 00:11:33.374\nsounds like something on Twitter.\n\n234\n00:11:33.374 --> 00:11:36.778\nspire7@sadlyit sounds like a hacker name,\nso\n\n235\n00:11:36.778 --> 00:11:40.020\nyou've just been hacked by spire7@sadly.\n\n236\n00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:43.789\nSo anyhow,\nyou have these options that are available.\n\n237\n00:11:43.789 --> 00:11:47.100\nThe whole point of the password assistant\nis to help you choose a strong password.\n\n238\n00:11:48.950 --> 00:11:51.823\nAll right, what else do we have?\n\n239\n00:11:51.823 --> 00:11:54.570\nTwo factor authentication all right.\n\n240\n00:11:54.570 --> 00:11:57.320\nThe recurring theme over the last\n15 minutes has been that passwords\n\n241\n00:11:57.320 --> 00:11:58.100\ncan get guessed.\n\n242\n00:11:58.100 --> 00:11:59.170\nThey can be brute forced.\n\n243\n00:11:59.170 --> 00:12:01.530\nPeople can break into them Mike,\nyou work with that.\n\n244\n00:12:01.530 --> 00:12:04.465\nYou've done brute force test\nin your security shows, right?\n\n245\n00:12:04.465 --> 00:12:05.222\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely yeah,\n\n246\n00:12:05.222 --> 00:12:08.310\nthere's programs out there that can\nautomate it with our processors today.\n\n247\n00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:11.282\nThey can do billions\nof guesses per second.\n\n248\n00:12:11.282 --> 00:12:12.840\nIt doesn't take long.\n\n249\n00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:14.640\n&gt;&gt; So what we're starting to see now,\n\n250\n00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:17.750\nis where we don't just have\nan username and a password.\n\n251\n00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:21.137\nInstead, we have a username,\na password, and something else.\n\n252\n00:12:21.137 --> 00:12:23.120\nWhen you log in, you've got a username.\n\n253\n00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:25.810\nBut the username is not a secret,\nthat's public.\n\n254\n00:12:25.810 --> 00:12:27.860\nHey, you've been watching this show,\nyou know my name is Don Pezet.\n\n255\n00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:30.460\nYou've got a pretty good idea\nwhat my username is gonna be.\n\n256\n00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:31.980\nMaybe it's DonPezet, maybe it's DPezet,\n\n257\n00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:36.080\nbut you've got a pretty good idea The\npassword though, that's the secret part,\n\n258\n00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:37.510\nthat's the part that's right up here.\n\n259\n00:12:37.510 --> 00:12:39.540\nAnd so when I log into the computer,\n\n260\n00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:42.980\nthe computer knows it's me\nif I type the password.\n\n261\n00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:45.090\nBut I can give my password to Mike.\n\n262\n00:12:45.090 --> 00:12:47.713\nAnd now Mike can login on my computer,\nhe's got my user name,\n\n263\n00:12:47.713 --> 00:12:50.349\nhe's got my password,\nthe computer will think that he is me.\n\n264\n00:12:50.349 --> 00:12:52.910\nIt has no way to know the difference.\n\n265\n00:12:52.910 --> 00:12:55.340\nSo, what people have started doing, and\n\n266\n00:12:55.340 --> 00:13:00.220\nApple is no different, are introducing\nadditional factors of authentication.\n\n267\n00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:02.200\nAt a minimum, two factors.\n\n268\n00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:03.980\nSo two factor authentication.\n\n269\n00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:06.373\nYou hear people talk about MFA also,\nMulti Factor Authentication,\n\n270\n00:13:06.373 --> 00:13:07.660\nthat's when you have more than two.\n\n271\n00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:09.650\nBut two is usually enough.\n\n272\n00:13:09.650 --> 00:13:13.980\nTo say, I am who I say I am, and\nI'm not somebody pretending to be me.\n\n273\n00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:17.895\nA password is one factor, but it can\nbe shared, so we normally combine that\n\n274\n00:13:17.895 --> 00:13:22.329\nwith another factor that can't be shared,\nsomething like a fingerprint, right?\n\n275\n00:13:22.329 --> 00:13:26.563\nOn an iPhone, you have Touch ID, that's a\nfingerprint, I can tell Mike my password,\n\n276\n00:13:26.563 --> 00:13:28.249\nbut can I tell him my fingerprint?\n\n277\n00:13:28.249 --> 00:13:29.430\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n278\n00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:32.010\n&gt;&gt; No, right, so\nthat fingerprint is important.\n\n279\n00:13:32.010 --> 00:13:35.640\nIn a security world, they have\nthis principles of authentication.\n\n280\n00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:40.774\nThere's something you have, something\nyou are, and something you know, right?\n\n281\n00:13:40.774 --> 00:13:44.073\nSo something you know would be\nlike a password in your mind but\n\n282\n00:13:44.073 --> 00:13:45.710\nit can be shared.\n\n283\n00:13:45.710 --> 00:13:49.175\nSomething you are, that would be\nbiometrics like fingerprint or\n\n284\n00:13:49.175 --> 00:13:49.999\nretinal scan.\n\n285\n00:13:49.999 --> 00:13:55.750\nAnd then something you have would be a\nphysical object that's in your possession.\n\n286\n00:13:55.750 --> 00:14:00.290\nAnd that is probably the most common\nsecond factor that we're seeing today.\n\n287\n00:14:00.290 --> 00:14:02.001\nWell, I guess finger prints.\n\n288\n00:14:02.001 --> 00:14:05.488\nWell, that's a tough call which is more\npopular today, used to be fingerprints.\n\n289\n00:14:05.488 --> 00:14:10.940\nBut now I can use something like\nmy cell phone as my second factor.\n\n290\n00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:14.460\nSo I can say hey, when I go to log in,\nI'm gonna give a user name and password.\n\n291\n00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:19.720\nThat's factor number one, and\nthen it can send a code to my phone,\n\n292\n00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:22.900\nand I can use my phone\nas the second factor.\n\n293\n00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:25.170\nSo now if Mike has my password,\nhe doesn't have my phone.\n\n294\n00:14:25.170 --> 00:14:28.190\nHe'd have to get that also to login.\n\n295\n00:14:28.190 --> 00:14:29.551\nApple's no different, they support that.\n\n296\n00:14:29.551 --> 00:14:32.040\nThey support two factor authentication.\n\n297\n00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:34.970\nIf you're authenticating with iCloud.\n\n298\n00:14:34.970 --> 00:14:36.629\nThat's the important part.\n\n299\n00:14:36.629 --> 00:14:40.950\nThe Mac OS itself does not support\ntwo-factor authentication.\n\n300\n00:14:40.950 --> 00:14:43.865\nLike that login screen screen where\nyou see the bubbles with usernames,\n\n301\n00:14:43.865 --> 00:14:45.840\nit does not support\ntwo-factor on that screen.\n\n302\n00:14:46.890 --> 00:14:50.676\nBut, within applications and\nin other areas, we can require it,\n\n303\n00:14:50.676 --> 00:14:54.471\nespecially in things like the App Store\nwhere the Apple ID is used.\n\n304\n00:14:54.471 --> 00:14:59.116\nAnd what we're gonna see is over the next\nfew years more and more parts of the Apple\n\n305\n00:14:59.116 --> 00:15:03.697\necosystem starting to use that App Store\nlogin until finally you'll be logging\n\n306\n00:15:03.697 --> 00:15:08.100\ninto Mac OS using your iCloud ID and\nthen we'll have two factor throughout.\n\n307\n00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:11.493\nBut for right now it is tied to that ID so\nlet me show you how that kinda works.\n\n308\n00:15:11.493 --> 00:15:16.738\nSo on this Mac I've created a user account\nfor myself right, so there's Don Pezet.\n\n309\n00:15:16.738 --> 00:15:18.865\nI'm an admin,\napparently I'm also a parrot,\n\n310\n00:15:18.865 --> 00:15:20.628\nmaybe this is my pirate admin account.\n\n311\n00:15:20.628 --> 00:15:24.273\nAnd when I log in,\nI've got a password assigned right.\n\n312\n00:15:24.273 --> 00:15:27.220\nAnd we're gonna test myself and\nsee if I remember what that password is.\n\n313\n00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:30.340\nSo let me log out, cuz I'm logged in\nas my help desk account right now.\n\n314\n00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:31.480\nSo I'm gonna log in as me.\n\n315\n00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:33.000\nAnd I don't think I've logged in before so\n\n316\n00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.100\nI might have to set up my\nprofile we'll find out here.\n\n317\n00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:37.437\nBut once it logs in,\nI just wanna give it the password.\n\n318\n00:15:37.437 --> 00:15:39.610\nRight, that's all that I gave it and\nthat's that.\n\n319\n00:15:39.610 --> 00:15:42.280\nSo if somebody knows my password,\nthey can log in as me and\n\n320\n00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:44.440\nhave access to,\nwell effectively nothing on this machine.\n\n321\n00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:47.349\nBut maybe this is my daily driver and\nso I do have documents and\n\n322\n00:15:47.349 --> 00:15:50.444\nall sorts of stuff on here I don't\nwant people to have access to.\n\n323\n00:15:50.444 --> 00:15:53.873\nIf we authenticate with\nan iCloud account though.\n\n324\n00:15:53.873 --> 00:15:57.947\nIf I go into system preferences,\nand set it up for iCloud here, or\n\n325\n00:15:57.947 --> 00:16:00.109\neven just inside of the app store.\n\n326\n00:16:00.109 --> 00:16:02.509\nIf you sign into the app store\nwith your account From there,\n\n327\n00:16:02.509 --> 00:16:05.781\nyou can enable two factor authentication,\nif you haven't enabled it already.\n\n328\n00:16:05.781 --> 00:16:08.590\nOn my account,\nit's already enabled because, well,\n\n329\n00:16:08.590 --> 00:16:10.472\nI don't anybody taking my account.\n\n330\n00:16:10.472 --> 00:16:10.972\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n331\n00:16:10.972 --> 00:16:12.384\n&gt;&gt; So, when I come in here and\n\n332\n00:16:12.384 --> 00:16:13.153\nI go to log in,\n\n333\n00:16:13.153 --> 00:16:15.330\nI'm gonna log in with my Apple ID.\nAnd so\n\n334\n00:16:15.330 --> 00:16:16.558\nI'll punch that in.\nAnd\n\n335\n00:16:16.558 --> 00:16:20.379\nthen I'll punch in whatever my password\nis, which, unfortunately, I don't worry\n\n336\n00:16:20.379 --> 00:16:24.070\nabout people stealing my password\nbecause I can barely remember it myself.\n\n337\n00:16:24.070 --> 00:16:25.050\n&gt;&gt; It's a little lengthy.\n\n338\n00:16:25.050 --> 00:16:26.130\n&gt;&gt; I know, let's see if I got that right.\n\n339\n00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:32.370\nIt's roses three quote jives,\nby the way, I wouldn't do that.\n\n340\n00:16:32.370 --> 00:16:33.680\nIt's actually roses four.\n\n341\n00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:37.440\nSo yeah, what it's doing right now\nis it's reaching out to Apple.\n\n342\n00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:42.610\nAnd it's saying hey, I've got this user\nname and password and does it work?\n\n343\n00:16:42.610 --> 00:16:44.990\nAnd Apple is gonna look at it and\nrespond back.\n\n344\n00:16:44.990 --> 00:16:47.750\nSo like back in our\ndirectory services episode,\n\n345\n00:16:47.750 --> 00:16:50.330\nhere it's Apple as that directory service.\n\n346\n00:16:50.330 --> 00:16:52.080\nAnd what it's gonna do is when\nit's gonna check my account,\n\n347\n00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:55.820\nit's gonna say all right, that username\nand password is good, but wait a minute.\n\n348\n00:16:55.820 --> 00:16:58.250\nDon's got two factor\nauthentication turned on.\n\n349\n00:16:58.250 --> 00:17:00.700\nSo you can't log in with just a name and\na password.\n\n350\n00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:03.147\nWe need more, and here it is.\n\n351\n00:17:03.147 --> 00:17:04.877\nAnd so this is two factor authentication.\n\n352\n00:17:04.877 --> 00:17:07.110\nIt's saying you need to\nverify your identity.\n\n353\n00:17:07.110 --> 00:17:11.130\nIt's not enough to just have\na username and a password.\n\n354\n00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:13.130\nIt's gonna send me a code.\n\n355\n00:17:13.130 --> 00:17:19.100\nAnd it can send me a code as\na text message to my cell phone or\n\n356\n00:17:19.100 --> 00:17:21.940\nit can have a message pop up on my iPad.\n\n357\n00:17:21.940 --> 00:17:25.810\nNow it's interesting that just one iPad is\nshowing up, cuz I have several devices.\n\n358\n00:17:25.810 --> 00:17:27.590\nBut anyhow, so there's at least one iPad.\n\n359\n00:17:27.590 --> 00:17:31.190\nSo, this is the extra\nauthentication I have.\n\n360\n00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:34.720\nIf I have my iPad with me,\nit's gonna send a code to me.\n\n361\n00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:36.340\nI'll be able to see that code.\n\n362\n00:17:36.340 --> 00:17:37.690\nOr if I have my phone with me,\n\n363\n00:17:37.690 --> 00:17:41.230\nwhich fortunately I do,\nit's gonna send me a text message.\n\n364\n00:17:41.230 --> 00:17:44.700\nAnd so I'm gonna hit continue,\nand we're just gonna wait and\n\n365\n00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:47.020\nsee if that code comes up.\n\n366\n00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:51.110\nLet me, here I'll set my phone up\non the table here so we can see it.\n\n367\n00:17:51.110 --> 00:17:52.610\nAnd there we go.\n\n368\n00:17:52.610 --> 00:17:55.710\nSo I just got a message, actually I\ngot a bunch of messages apparently.\n\n369\n00:17:55.710 --> 00:17:57.180\nBut we'll take a look at this one.\n\n370\n00:17:57.180 --> 00:17:58.640\nRight here is the one that I want.\n\n371\n00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:01.530\nI guess that's gonna make me\nunlock to get at it here.\n\n372\n00:18:01.530 --> 00:18:04.840\nHang on a second, let's,\nthis whole upside-down thing, there we go!\n\n373\n00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:10.050\nAnd what you can see is actually,\na whole chain of codes that I've received\n\n374\n00:18:10.050 --> 00:18:14.640\nover the last week or month or whatever\nthis, probably goes back in a long time.\n\n375\n00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:17.840\nAnd I don't mind showing\nthese codes on camera because\n\n376\n00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:19.870\nthe codes are only good one time.\n\n377\n00:18:19.870 --> 00:18:22.180\nSo I've used each of these codes, and\n\n378\n00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:24.240\nthey're burned,\nthey're dead once you use them.\n\n379\n00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:26.960\nSo my code right now is 4080.\n\n380\n00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:31.480\nSo when I go to log in back on the\ncomputer, it's asking me for that code.\n\n381\n00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:33.480\nAnd so I type in 4080.\n\n382\n00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:36.730\nAnd it's gonna verify that that's right.\n\n383\n00:18:36.730 --> 00:18:40.340\nOkay, if it's wrong,\nwell then I gotta try again right?\n\n384\n00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:43.060\nBut if it's right,\nthat code is now invalidated.\n\n385\n00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:47.540\nSo if Mike knew my password and\nnow he goes 4080, he could go and log in.\n\n386\n00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:48.630\nThis code just got burned right?\n\n387\n00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:50.050\nSo they're one time use codes.\n\n388\n00:18:50.050 --> 00:18:53.430\nThey're called OTPs, one time passwords.\n\n389\n00:18:53.430 --> 00:18:57.620\nSo that one's now been burned, and\nnow I'm gonna authenticate with iCloud.\n\n390\n00:18:57.620 --> 00:18:59.750\nThe nice part here is we can secure and\n\n391\n00:18:59.750 --> 00:19:04.650\nprotect our device with an iCloud account,\nand we get two factor authentication.\n\n392\n00:19:04.650 --> 00:19:09.370\nSo if we turn on things like Find My Mac,\nand somebody steals your laptop, and\n\n393\n00:19:09.370 --> 00:19:13.870\nthey go to try and hide it, right,\ntry and disable Find My Mac.\n\n394\n00:19:13.870 --> 00:19:15.840\nThey won't be able to cuz they don't\nhave two factor authentication.\n\n395\n00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:17.750\nThey'll have to just\nerase the whole thing.\n\n396\n00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:20.980\nWhich can lead to other problems,\nand here you'll see it's offering to\n\n397\n00:19:20.980 --> 00:19:23.270\nturn on Find My Mac and\nsome of those other features.\n\n398\n00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:27.060\nSo that's what two factor authentication\nhelps us with, and not just that,\n\n399\n00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:28.670\nbut app purchases.\n\n400\n00:19:28.670 --> 00:19:32.950\nSo if I were to go into the App Store and\n\n401\n00:19:32.950 --> 00:19:36.750\ngo to buy something for example,\nI need to be signed into the App Store.\n\n402\n00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:39.480\nWell, not just my credentials but\n\n403\n00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:42.620\nmy credit card information\nis tied to the App Store.\n\n404\n00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:44.402\nAnd so I don't want that to get out.\n\n405\n00:19:44.402 --> 00:19:47.790\nAnd so we tie two factor\nauthentication to that too.\n\n406\n00:19:47.790 --> 00:19:50.870\nWe talk about how great Apple security is,\nand I can tell you guys,\n\n407\n00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:56.740\nin my entire life, I've only had\none account ever get compromised.\n\n408\n00:19:56.740 --> 00:19:58.492\nAnd it was my Apple App Store account.\n\n409\n00:19:58.492 --> 00:20:01.800\nJust started all the sudden started\nseeing these Korean charges popping up.\n\n410\n00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:02.890\nIt was really bizarre.\n\n411\n00:20:02.890 --> 00:20:06.410\nSo you reset the password,\nyou turn on two factor.\n\n412\n00:20:06.410 --> 00:20:08.710\nThis was before two factor authentication,\nso\n\n413\n00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:10.760\nit's one of the things\nthat's kind of been fixed.\n\n414\n00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:12.350\nAnd that's what this is designed for.\n\n415\n00:20:12.350 --> 00:20:16.180\nSo you'll see here that it's automatically\nsignedme into the App Store.\n\n416\n00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:18.590\nAnd now I'm ready to make\ncredit card purchases, right?\n\n417\n00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:21.450\nWell if I go to make a credit card\npurchase, I've gotta be authenticated.\n\n418\n00:20:21.450 --> 00:20:22.850\nI'm gonna provide my password,\n\n419\n00:20:22.850 --> 00:20:26.880\nI'm gonna have to pass the two factor\ncheck in order to buy something.\n\n420\n00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:28.275\nSo I can't just go in here and,\n\n421\n00:20:28.275 --> 00:20:31.080\nwhat's the most expensive thing\nwe can find in the App Store?\n\n422\n00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:34.357\nProbably Final Cut, which I think is $300.\n\n423\n00:20:34.357 --> 00:20:38.130\nSo I can jump in here and\nbuy, yeah 299.99-\n\n424\n00:20:38.130 --> 00:20:38.710\n&gt;&gt; That's close-\n\n425\n00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:39.380\n&gt;&gt; Not quite 300.\n\n426\n00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:40.980\nSo I can't just jump in here and\n\n427\n00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:45.620\nmake a $300 purchase without actually\nhaving the credentials to do so, right.\n\n428\n00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:50.017\nSo if we go in here and try to buy it,\nthen it's gonna come up and\n\n429\n00:20:50.017 --> 00:20:53.775\n[LAUGH] it says I don't\nhave four gigs of memory.\n\n430\n00:20:53.775 --> 00:20:54.790\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm\n\n431\n00:20:54.790 --> 00:20:56.990\nin a virtual machine that doesn't\nhave four gigs of RAM, got it.\n\n432\n00:20:56.990 --> 00:20:58.410\nAll right, so it stopped me there.\n\n433\n00:20:58.410 --> 00:21:02.020\nBut if I had enough memory in this\nvirtual machine, then it would let me and\n\n434\n00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:04.840\nthen we'd be back to business, so\nif I was like on my regular laptop.\n\n435\n00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:07.020\nBut that's part of what two\nfactor authentication does, and\n\n436\n00:21:07.020 --> 00:21:10.030\nyou're seeing more and\nmore companies pushing that out.\n\n437\n00:21:10.030 --> 00:21:11.490\nBecause it is so important, right?\n\n438\n00:21:11.490 --> 00:21:14.370\nWhen you log into Facebook or Twitter,\na lot of them have two factor now, and\n\n439\n00:21:14.370 --> 00:21:16.316\nwe're going to see that\nintegrated more and more.\n\n440\n00:21:16.316 --> 00:21:18.906\nSo, MacOS supports that with iCloud.\n\n441\n00:21:18.906 --> 00:21:20.670\nThat's important to remember for the exam.\n\n442\n00:21:20.670 --> 00:21:22.950\nIt doesn't support it with just\nyour regular local account.\n\n443\n00:21:22.950 --> 00:21:25.710\nMy local account still\njust has a password.\n\n444\n00:21:25.710 --> 00:21:28.550\nAnd that's why it's so\nimportant to not neglect your password.\n\n445\n00:21:28.550 --> 00:21:30.328\nSome people say, I've got two factors.\n\n446\n00:21:30.328 --> 00:21:33.484\nI'll use is an easy password,\npassword 123, what do I care?\n\n447\n00:21:33.484 --> 00:21:35.536\nBut you still don't\nwant people to know it,\n\n448\n00:21:35.536 --> 00:21:37.480\nyou still need to protect that password.\n\n449\n00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:38.880\n&gt;&gt; All right Don, fantastic look there.\n\n450\n00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:40.956\nSome of the ways that Mac OS\ntries to keep us safe.\n\n451\n00:21:40.956 --> 00:21:42.962\nWe took a look at\nthe The Password Assistant.\n\n452\n00:21:42.962 --> 00:21:47.612\nHow we can help generate strong passwords\nas well as looking at multifactor or\n\n453\n00:21:47.612 --> 00:21:52.090\ntwofactor authentication,\nways to again improve our authentication.\n\n454\n00:21:52.090 --> 00:21:53.410\nSo we appreciate that Don.\n\n455\n00:21:53.410 --> 00:21:55.450\nHope everybody out there\nenjoyed watching this one.\n\n456\n00:21:55.450 -->

00:00:08.200\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.310\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:15.180\n&gt;&gt; Hello welcome to another\nexciting episode here at ITProTV,\n\n6\n00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:19.310\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick and today\nwe're doing our Mac integration basics.\n\n7\n00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:22.310\nIn this episode we're\nactually continuing on.\n\n8\n00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:23.180\nBut they're security features.\n\n9\n00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.480\nWe've already seen quite a few that we can\nimplement to help keep our system safe and\n\n10\n00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.900\nthere are more that we need to go over for\nthis exam.\n\n11\n00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.160\nAnd here to guide us through that is Mr.\nDon Pezet.\n\n12\n00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.090\nWelcome back Don.\n\n13\n00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.170\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for having me back Mike.\n\n14\n00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.540\nAnd yeah, just kinda continuing\nour security adventure.\n\n15\n00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.230\nIn the last episode we talked\na lot about passwords.\n\n16\n00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.760\nAnd how important it was to have\na password on your user account.\n\n17\n00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.650\nOr two factor authentication and so on.\n\n18\n00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:49.160\nBut let's put ourselves in the mind of\nan attacker for a moment and say that,\n\n19\n00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.160\nor maybe not just an attacker,\nmaybe just an opportunist, right?\n\n20\n00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.170\nSo, one day you call a taxi cab or an Uber\nor whatever and the cab pulls up and\n\n21\n00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.670\nyou hop in the backseat,\nsomebody left their laptop right there.\n\n22\n00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.800\nNow, the good Samaritan\nwould take their laptop and\n\n23\n00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.539\nsay I need to find the owner and\nlet's return it and go to that process,\n\n24\n00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.490\nthe opportunist,\nthe rogue opportunist will look at it and\n\n25\n00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.080\nsay, hm, wonder what I can get for\nthat on eBay, right?\n\n26\n00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.100\nI wonder information I could find on that.\n\n27\n00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.640\nAnd so if they open up the laptop and\npower it on.\n\n28\n00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.750\nYou got a password,\ncan't do anything right?\n\n29\n00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.610\n&gt;&gt; Oops stuck\n&gt;&gt; Not necessarily, right?\n\n30\n00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:32.710\nOn a Mac yes, it's protected when\nyou boot into the operating system.\n\n31\n00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:34.390\nBut what if you don't boot\ninto the operating system?\n\n32\n00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.360\nWhat if you boot into something else,\nright?\n\n33\n00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.796\nI could take a USB key and stick it on the\nside of the laptop and I could boot Linux.\n\n34\n00:01:41.796 --> 00:01:42.370\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n35\n00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:44.050\n&gt;&gt; I could boot some\nother operating system.\n\n36\n00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:46.980\nI could even boot off a MacOS installer.\n\n37\n00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:49.440\nAnd when I do that,\nit's not gonna have a password is it?\n\n38\n00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.470\nAnd I can then mount the Mac\nhard drive and browse in and\n\n39\n00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:59.260\nstart accessing files and resources\nwithout a user name and password, right?\n\n40\n00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.850\nSo physical security in\na laptop is pretty important,\n\n41\n00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.960\nif somebody is a USB key away from\nbooting your laptop to an alternate means\n\n42\n00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.810\nwe've gotta stop that from happening.\n\n43\n00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.350\nAnd so, there is another type\nof password that we can set,\n\n44\n00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.130\nthat we didnt' cover the last episode.\n\n45\n00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.900\nAnd that's what's called\nthe firmware password.\n\n46\n00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.130\nWhen you push the power\nbutton on your Mac.\n\n47\n00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.630\nAnd I wish I could show this, but\nit doesn't initialize the video\n\n48\n00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.750\nadapters in the right order for\nme to show it on camera.\n\n49\n00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.070\nBut when you push the power button on\na MacBook and really it's the same for\n\n50\n00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:31.470\nan iMac or a MacPro,\nit's kind of the same process.\n\n51\n00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.952\nYou hit the power button and\nthe system BIAS kicks in,\n\n52\n00:02:34.952 --> 00:02:37.310\nthe firmware what's built into\nthe motherboard kicks in.\n\n53\n00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.480\nAnd it does things like\nsome basic hardware checks.\n\n54\n00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.080\nAnd it looks for the operating system and\nthen it starts up the Apple operating\n\n55\n00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.670\nsystem, so that can boot up and\nwe can get logged in.\n\n56\n00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:48.780\nAll of this is happening.\n\n57\n00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:50.770\nKind of in the background.\n\n58\n00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:53.570\nWhat we see on the screen is a little\nwhite apple appears in the middle of\n\n59\n00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:56.930\nthe screen, and then a little\nstatus bar zooms across the bottom.\n\n60\n00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.820\nA lot of times, it goes so fast you don't\neven see it, and it's just the apple\n\n61\n00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:04.470\nsitting there for a moment, and\nthen you're at the Mac OS login screen.\n\n62\n00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.900\nBut if somebody puts in a USB key and\n\n63\n00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.050\nbypasses that,\nthey never get to the login screen.\n\n64\n00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:13.140\nThey see the little apple, and\nthen they boot off of their USB key, and\n\n65\n00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.940\nthey see whatever operating system\nit is they're booting, right?\n\n66\n00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:20.230\nSo what we can do is we can put\na password on the firmware so\n\n67\n00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.040\nthat when you push power on your device,\n\n68\n00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.380\nthe moment it powers on,\nit's gonna go to boot off the hard drive.\n\n69\n00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.350\nAnd if somebody tries to bypass\nthat to boot off a USB key for\n\n70\n00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:37.690\nexample, it's not going to let them unless\nthey provide the firmware password.\n\n71\n00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:42.050\nIt stops somebody from\nbypassing the operating system.\n\n72\n00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:43.790\nNow, firmware passwords\nhave been around for\n\n73\n00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.877\na long time and\nmost people hate them, right?\n\n74\n00:03:46.877 --> 00:03:48.870\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I was getting ready to ask,\n\n75\n00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.440\ndo you see this implemented a lot,\n\n76\n00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:54.075\nbecause it is adding another\nstep to my logon process.\n\n77\n00:03:54.075 --> 00:03:56.380\n&gt;&gt; Right,and think about the old way,\nright?\n\n78\n00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:59.250\nYou push power, you have to provide\na firmware password, and then it will boot\n\n79\n00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.850\nthe operating system, and then you've\ngotta log in with your account.\n\n80\n00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:04.330\nTwo passwords, that's annoying, right?\n\n81\n00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:09.170\nBut the way Apple did it is Apple said\nlook, if you push power and you're\n\n82\n00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:12.460\nbooting into your regular OS, we're not\ngonna bother with the firmware password.\n\n83\n00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:14.120\nThat's okay, that's expected behavior.\n\n84\n00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.650\nYou're allowed to boot into the OS.\n\n85\n00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:21.530\nBut if you try and bypass the OS,\nif you try and boot any other way Now,\n\n86\n00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:23.760\nwe're gonna ask for\nthe firmware password, okay?\n\n87\n00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.350\nNow, how do you boot another way.\n\n88\n00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:27.490\nWell, when you push the power button.\n\n89\n00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:31.100\nIf you immediately hold the option\nkey on your keyboard or\n\n90\n00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:33.860\nalternate depending on what kind of\nkeyboard you have with option key on a Mac\n\n91\n00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:36.960\nkeyboard, if you're holding Option,\n\n92\n00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.950\nwhen that apple appears, it'll then give\nyou a list of all the drives attached.\n\n93\n00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:45.030\nAnd you'll normally see your Mac OS\nhard drive, which is where Mac OS sits.\n\n94\n00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:47.935\nYou'll normally see\na recovery partition and\n\n95\n00:04:47.935 --> 00:04:52.365\nyou'll see any USB removable media laid\nout to the side okay and you might see\n\n96\n00:04:52.365 --> 00:04:55.935\nan option about internet recovery too\nthat shows up on some and not on others.\n\n97\n00:04:55.935 --> 00:04:57.915\nSo those are what are all gonna appear.\n\n98\n00:04:57.915 --> 00:05:03.065\nIf I chose a USB disk I'm bypassing\nthe operating system aren't I, right?\n\n99\n00:05:03.065 --> 00:05:06.105\nAnd so, when you hold that Option\nkey on the keyboard and you go and\n\n100\n00:05:06.105 --> 00:05:08.480\nget that list of what media to boot from.\n\n101\n00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:11.800\nThat's when it's gonna say, all right,\ngive, give me a firmware password.\n\n102\n00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:13.470\n&gt;&gt; You've got to have a password\nif you want to bypass this.\n\n103\n00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:15.250\nOtherwise, I'm gonna boot from Mac OS.\n\n104\n00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:17.200\nWe're gonna go through\nthe regular operation.\n\n105\n00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:20.720\nSo it stops an attacker from being\nable to bypass your OS, all right?\n\n106\n00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:23.990\nThe thing about a firmware password is,\nthough, it, it's not turned on by default.\n\n107\n00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:26.050\nWe've got to turn it on.\n\n108\n00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:28.000\nAnd if this is your\ndesktop in your office,\n\n109\n00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.240\nyou probably don't care\nabout it that much.\n\n110\n00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:30.750\nBut if you have a laptop.\n\n111\n00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:32.480\nRight?\nSomething that could easily be stolen and\n\n112\n00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:33.460\ntaken away.\n\n113\n00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:36.450\nThat is a great place to\nassign a firmware password.\n\n114\n00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:39.810\nThe way you do it is first\nyou need boot into recovery.\n\n115\n00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:42.650\nYou can't do it in the regular system,\nright?\n\n116\n00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:45.240\nFor whatever reason it can't write\nto the bios once the system is up.\n\n117\n00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:46.480\nSo we need to boot into recovery.\n\n118\n00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:50.610\nNow, how do you boot to recovery is\npretty much the same on every Mac.\n\n119\n00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:56.170\nOn a Mac mini all the way up to a Mac Pro,\non a Macbook you push the power button,\n\n120\n00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:58.930\nand you hold command R, right?\n\n121\n00:05:58.930 --> 00:05:59.850\nAnd this another one I can't\n\n122\n00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:02.560\nreally show you on camera because\nall you would see is a black screen.\n\n123\n00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:06.490\nSo what you're doing, is that you\nare holding command R on the keyboard.\n\n124\n00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:11.400\nWhat I normally do is push the power\nbutton and then immediately command R.\n\n125\n00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:14.800\nAnd then you're going to hold command R.\n\n126\n00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:16.860\nUntill you see the Apple menu and\n\n127\n00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:21.120\nthe status bar starts growing across,\nall right, then you can look And\n\n128\n00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:24.880\nthen what it's gonna do is instead of\nbooting to your regular operating system\n\n129\n00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:28.230\nit's gonna boot to the screen\nthat I've got up right now, okay.\n\n130\n00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:31.560\nSo this screen right here,\nthis is Recovery.\n\n131\n00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:33.960\nThis is the recovery menu on the Mac and\n\n132\n00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:37.770\nit's installed by default on every match\nso unless you've formatted yours and\n\n133\n00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:41.590\ndone something weird to it, you have\nrecovery built right into the system.\n\n134\n00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:44.950\nIf you have formatted it or you maybe got\na new hard drive that's completely blank.\n\n135\n00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:46.680\nAnd you can build a recovery disk.\n\n136\n00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:49.320\nActually, any Mac OS\ninstall media will do it.\n\n137\n00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:53.410\nSo if you create a USB key that\nhas macOS Sierra on there,\n\n138\n00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:56.800\nyou can boot off of that USB key and\ngo to recovery that way.\n\n139\n00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:58.800\nBut it requires booting off a USB key,\ndoesn't it?\n\n140\n00:06:58.800 --> 00:06:59.950\nRight?\nSo, that's where we\n\n141\n00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:02.150\nhave that firmware password\nwe have to remember.\n\n142\n00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:04.040\nNow, when you go into recovery.\n\n143\n00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:07.940\nRecovery is a very very stripped\ndown version of macOS, right?\n\n144\n00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:09.530\nI use a lot of features.\n\n145\n00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:12.920\nOne feature you've seen me use in\nthe show is I use the zoom in feature.\n\n146\n00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:15.020\nIn recovery I don't have\nmy zoom in feature.\n\n147\n00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:18.820\nSo, I'm gonna apologize now for things\nbeing on a little bit on the tiny side but\n\n148\n00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:20.580\nwhat you're seeing are four options here.\n\n149\n00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:24.050\nRestore from time machine,\nre-install Mac OS.\n\n150\n00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:26.610\nGet help online, and disk utility.\n\n151\n00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:29.390\nOkay, I don't actually want any of these.\n\n152\n00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:34.445\nWhat I want, is hidden In a way\nup here under the Utilities menu.\n\n153\n00:07:34.445 --> 00:07:39.785\nAnd under Utilities, you'll see\nFirmware Password Utility, okay.\n\n154\n00:07:39.785 --> 00:07:44.445\nNow, I'm doing this on my actual\nlaptop right here on the desk.\n\n155\n00:07:44.445 --> 00:07:47.990\nI can't do this in a virtual machine\ncuz virtual machines don't run\n\n156\n00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:49.430\nApple firmware, right?\n\n157\n00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:52.935\nAnd on a desktop, well I wouldn't have\na screen to see what I was doing so\n\n158\n00:07:52.935 --> 00:07:54.699\nI'm doing it on my actual machine.\n\n159\n00:07:54.699 --> 00:07:57.473\nSo this is what its like\non an actual device and\n\n160\n00:07:57.473 --> 00:08:00.176\nI'll go to the firmware password utility.\n\n161\n00:08:00.176 --> 00:08:03.783\nAnd when that launches It's gonna offer\nfor me to turn on the firmware password,\n\n162\n00:08:03.783 --> 00:08:06.895\nthere's only one button to hit,\nit's kinda hard to screw this one up\n\n163\n00:08:06.895 --> 00:08:07.800\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n164\n00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:09.040\n&gt;&gt; We turn on and we just pick what we\n\n165\n00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:10.180\nwant our password to be.\n\n166\n00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:17.650\nSo you're gonna punch in a password that\nis strong but not something you'll forget.\n\n167\n00:08:17.650 --> 00:08:18.720\nCuz if you forget it,\nboy, are you screwed.\n\n168\n00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:22.360\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right, so, [LAUGH] I'm gonna ask this\n\n169\n00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:25.780\nquestion for, if I forget my firmware\npassword, how do I get it reset?\n\n170\n00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:30.280\nWell, what you do is you take your\ninvoice from where you bought the device.\n\n171\n00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:32.450\nAnd you take the device and\nyou go to an Apple store.\n\n172\n00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:36.250\nAnd you've gotta show them that you own\nthe device, and then they can reset it for\n\n173\n00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:36.895\nyou at the Apple store.\n\n174\n00:08:36.895 --> 00:08:38.135\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n&gt;&gt; They can do it but\n\n175\n00:08:38.135 --> 00:08:40.900\nyou've got to show proof of ownership.\n\n176\n00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:41.460\nYou're gonna have to\n\n177\n00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:44.300\nhave that invoice that shows you\nbought the device, or a receipt.\n\n178\n00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:47.430\nAll right, so I'm gonna go and\nset my password, and there we go.\n\n179\n00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:51.170\nAnd now I've only got one option,\nQuit Firmware Password Utility.\n\n180\n00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:52.760\nSo I'll quit, all right.\n\n181\n00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:56.210\nNow, I have a firmware password,\nvery exciting.\n\n182\n00:08:56.210 --> 00:09:00.030\nIf I were to reboot right now,\nthings are gonna boot just like normal.\n\n183\n00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:01.550\nIt's really not gonna be any different.\n\n184\n00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:04.300\nSo if I go up here and\nhit my Apple menu and\n\n185\n00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:07.075\nhit Restart, my device is gonna reboot.\n\n186\n00:09:07.075 --> 00:09:08.656\nIt's gonna go to a black screen, right,\n\n187\n00:09:08.656 --> 00:09:10.475\nthis is the really exciting\nmoment on the show.\n\n188\n00:09:10.475 --> 00:09:11.962\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; The cliffhanger here,\n\n189\n00:09:11.962 --> 00:09:13.440\nwhat's gonna happen next?\n\n190\n00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:14.970\nAnd then it's gonna boot.\n\n191\n00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:18.181\nAnd what we'll see is, well I guess\nI've got two screens, right, so\n\n192\n00:09:18.181 --> 00:09:20.753\nit's not gonna do a screen\nmirroring right off the bat.\n\n193\n00:09:20.753 --> 00:09:23.940\nBut I see my little Apple menu and\nthe line goes across.\n\n194\n00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:27.020\nAnd then it takes me right\nhere to my login screen.\n\n195\n00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:28.660\nAnd I end up with my login screen, right?\n\n196\n00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:30.530\n[INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; So nothing different.\n\n197\n00:09:30.530 --> 00:09:32.030\n&gt;&gt; No firmware password at all, right?\n\n198\n00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:36.650\nSo it doesn't inconvenience me as\nthe end user one single bit, okay?\n\n199\n00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:39.920\nBut if I were to shut down, right,\nso it's gonna shut down now.\n\n200\n00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:41.720\nAnd once it's shut down,\n\n201\n00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:46.510\nif I boot up while holding the option key,\nI'm gonna bypass it.\n\n202\n00:09:46.510 --> 00:09:49.530\nThen now it's gonna prompt for\nthat password.\n\n203\n00:09:49.530 --> 00:09:52.080\n&gt;&gt; So no inconvenience for\nan end user that's booting normally.\n\n204\n00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:54.629\nCould you show us what it looks like when\nan attacker tries to boot this machine?\n\n205\n00:09:54.629 --> 00:09:56.221\n&gt;&gt; I was hoping you wouldn't ask.\n\n206\n00:09:56.221 --> 00:09:57.709\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n207\n00:09:57.709 --> 00:09:58.932\n&gt;&gt; So it's a little bit challenging but\n\n208\n00:09:58.932 --> 00:09:59.726\nI can show you, let me.\n\n209\n00:09:59.726 --> 00:10:01.950\nI'm gonna unhook my laptop here.\n\n210\n00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:05.350\nSo, basically what I need to do is\nshow you what's on my screen but\n\n211\n00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:08.620\nit's a locked screen so it hasn't\npowered on the display port or HDMI.\n\n212\n00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:10.560\nSo it's just on the native screen.\n\n213\n00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:13.650\nSo we're gonna flip around\nto our little Skycam here.\n\n214\n00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:16.630\nAnd I'll show you the process that\nan attacker would go through.\n\n215\n00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:22.690\nThat basically what's gonna happen is\nthey're gonna take my laptop or whatever.\n\n216\n00:10:22.690 --> 00:10:25.940\nAnd they're gonna power it on, normally\nwe just hit the power button, right?\n\n217\n00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:30.190\nBut if I hold the option button\ndown while we boot, right, so\n\n218\n00:10:30.190 --> 00:10:33.170\nI'm gonna hold option and\nI'm gonna hit that power button.\n\n219\n00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:33.950\nNow it's gonna boot and\n\n220\n00:10:33.950 --> 00:10:38.600\nthis would normally show me the media\nthat was available for me to select.\n\n221\n00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:40.550\nBut that's not what I get, right?\n\n222\n00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:43.455\nInstead of being shown the media list,\nI get a lock.\n\n223\n00:10:43.455 --> 00:10:45.160\nThis is the firmware lock.\n\n224\n00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:49.856\nAnd it only shows up when we try and\nbypass the normal boot order.\n\n225\n00:10:49.856 --> 00:10:53.359\nIf I boot it to regular old Mac OS,\nwhich has my user account and password,\n\n226\n00:10:53.359 --> 00:10:54.720\nwe're protected.\n\n227\n00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:56.860\nIf I try and bypass, we get this.\n\n228\n00:10:56.860 --> 00:11:00.277\n&gt;&gt; Very cool, so\ngreat security feature, yet it still,\n\n229\n00:11:00.277 --> 00:11:04.980\nit doesn't add any extra inconvenience or\nsecond logon for that end user.\n\n230\n00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:07.130\nSo it's not something\nthey're gonna complain about.\n\n231\n00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:08.512\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nthey'll find a way to complain, right?\n\n232\n00:11:08.512 --> 00:11:09.410\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n233\n00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:12.400\nhopefully it's not that\nbig of an issue for us.\n\n234\n00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:16.620\nThe main thing though is that it does\nprotect your laptop if it gets stolen.\n\n235\n00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:20.502\nAnd we're gonna talk more probably in\nthe next episode about FileVault and\n\n236\n00:11:20.502 --> 00:11:21.866\nfull-disk encryption.\n\n237\n00:11:21.866 --> 00:11:27.810\nAnd with full-disk encryption, when you\nlog in that decrypts your disk, right?\n\n238\n00:11:27.810 --> 00:11:31.080\nIf you don't log in,\nyour disk is encrypted.\n\n239\n00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:36.130\nYou'd have to bypass the boot\nto see even the encrypted disk,\n\n240\n00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:37.660\nand here we wouldn't be\nable to bypass the disk.\n\n241\n00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:40.890\nSo you'd have perfect\nprotection of your data.\n\n242\n00:11:40.890 --> 00:11:44.770\nFirmware passwords work together\nwith full-disk encryption,\n\n243\n00:11:44.770 --> 00:11:47.020\nto really give you that\nsecure information base.\n\n244\n00:11:47.020 --> 00:11:48.161\nSo definitely something you\nwant to take advantage on.\n\n245\n00:11:48.161 --> 00:11:52.695\nOn any mobile device you have, any device\nthat you run the risk of losing physical\n\n246\n00:11:52.695 --> 00:11:55.050\naccess to, that's gonna be important.\n\n247\n00:11:55.050 --> 00:11:56.110\nAnd sorry if I look distracted.\n\n248\n00:11:56.110 --> 00:12:00.310\nI'm trying to login to my laptop here\nin the background and get back in.\n\n249\n00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:03.784\nThe normal way, cuz I had my firmware\npassword, so I was able to do that and\n\n250\n00:12:03.784 --> 00:12:04.745\nget logged back in.\n\n251\n00:12:04.745 --> 00:12:09.930\nAll right, speaking of passwords, so we\nsaw account passwords in the last episode.\n\n252\n00:12:09.930 --> 00:12:12.040\nWe just saw firmware passwords right here.\n\n253\n00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:13.820\nIf I want to turn that password off,\nby the way,\n\n254\n00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:15.550\nI'd have to move back into Recovery.\n\n255\n00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:17.960\nAnd go back into the firmware utility and\nturn that off,\n\n256\n00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:20.450\nwhich I'll need to do after this show or\nI'll forget the password.\n\n257\n00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:23.900\nBut easy enough to just turn off\nonce you boot back into Recovery.\n\n258\n00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:26.980\nThere is another thing that\nwe need to be aware of.\n\n259\n00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:31.790\nAnd that is once you've logged in,\nso I fire up the computer,\n\n260\n00:12:31.790 --> 00:12:34.920\nI punch in my username and\nmy password, and I start work.\n\n261\n00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:37.970\nAnd then I decide I'm gonna pop off and\nget a glass of water.\n\n262\n00:12:37.970 --> 00:12:41.530\nOr take a lunch break, or whatever,\nand I walk away from the computer.\n\n263\n00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:43.310\nWell, once you walk away\nfrom your computer,\n\n264\n00:12:43.310 --> 00:12:46.250\nif you leave your self logged in,\nanybody could just come.\n\n265\n00:12:46.250 --> 00:12:49.100\nAnd sit down in your chair and\nstart using your computer, right?\n\n266\n00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:52.700\nSo we need to make sure that we\ndon't leave our computer where\n\n267\n00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:54.450\nanybody can log in.\n\n268\n00:12:54.450 --> 00:12:57.374\nBut we don't want the inconvenience of\nhaving to do something crazy like, hey,\n\n269\n00:12:57.374 --> 00:12:59.610\nI'm about to go get some water so\nlet me shut my computer down.\n\n270\n00:12:59.610 --> 00:13:00.482\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n271\n00:13:00.482 --> 00:13:03.080\n&gt;&gt; And then I'll go get some water, and\nwhen I get back I'll boot it back up.\n\n272\n00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:04.870\nThat's not realistic, right?\n\n273\n00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:08.040\nSo we've got ways we that can\ndo what's called screen locking.\n\n274\n00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:09.830\nWe can lock the screen so\n\n275\n00:13:09.830 --> 00:13:12.770\nthat if somebody wants to use the computer\nthey've got to provide a password.\n\n276\n00:13:12.770 --> 00:13:15.010\nAgain, making sure that a password\nhas to be presented for\n\n277\n00:13:15.010 --> 00:13:16.790\nthem to access the system.\n\n278\n00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:19.590\nIt is not turned on by default.\n\n279\n00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:23.150\nSo by default when you set up a Mac,\nyou can provide a username and password.\n\n280\n00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:26.528\nYou can setup for automatic log\nin with no screen locking and\n\n281\n00:13:26.528 --> 00:13:29.128\nthat means just anybody has\naccess to the device at anytime.\n\n282\n00:13:29.128 --> 00:13:31.400\nAnd that might be fine for\nyour home computer.\n\n283\n00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:34.630\nBut in a work environment,\nwe don't want that to happen.\n\n284\n00:13:34.630 --> 00:13:38.692\nSo what we can do is we can piggyback\noff of the power saving and\n\n285\n00:13:38.692 --> 00:13:40.430\nscreensaver functions.\n\n286\n00:13:40.430 --> 00:13:43.524\nA power saving says, hey, if my\ncomputer has been sitting here idle for\n\n287\n00:13:43.524 --> 00:13:46.300\na certain amount of time,\nturn the screen off.\n\n288\n00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:49.444\nOr display pictures of polar bears or\nwhatever it is that they set up for\n\n289\n00:13:49.444 --> 00:13:50.043\nus, right?\n\n290\n00:13:50.043 --> 00:13:51.560\nSo, you can have it do that.\n\n291\n00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:55.110\nWell, when somebody wakes the computer\nback up, right, if they touch a key,\n\n292\n00:13:55.110 --> 00:13:59.060\nthe polar bears go away or\nthe screen turns back on.\n\n293\n00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:01.250\nAnd we can make it require\na password at that time.\n\n294\n00:14:01.250 --> 00:14:07.380\nAnd it is a good idea to do this because\nno matter how security conscious you are,\n\n295\n00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:10.540\nI mean I'm guilty of this too,\nI lock my screen like crazy.\n\n296\n00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:13.450\nI do it by hand,\nI don't like to wait for timers.\n\n297\n00:14:13.450 --> 00:14:15.050\nBut every now and then you forget.\n\n298\n00:14:15.050 --> 00:14:17.998\n&gt;&gt; You think you're gonna be gone for\njust a second, and then something happens,\n\n299\n00:14:17.998 --> 00:14:19.766\nyou end up talking to somebody,\nyou get stuck.\n\n300\n00:14:19.766 --> 00:14:20.860\nAnd before you know it,\n\n301\n00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:24.180\nit's ten,15 minutes before you\nmake it back to your laptop.\n\n302\n00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:24.940\n&gt;&gt; Yep, absolutely.\n\n303\n00:14:24.940 --> 00:14:27.838\nSo that's happened to me,\nit happens to everybody.\n\n304\n00:14:27.838 --> 00:14:29.857\nIf we wanna set it up where it\npiggybacks off of the regular timer,\n\n305\n00:14:29.857 --> 00:14:30.862\nit's always pretty easy to do.\n\n306\n00:14:30.862 --> 00:14:32.460\nLet me show you how to do that.\n\n307\n00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:35.180\nSo I'm gonna jump back into\nmy System Preferences.\n\n308\n00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:39.080\nAnd inside of System Preferences,\nthere's a lot of stuff in here, right?\n\n309\n00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:43.624\nUnder Energy Saver is where you can set\nwhether the display gets turned off,\n\n310\n00:14:43.624 --> 00:14:44.127\nright?\n\n311\n00:14:44.127 --> 00:14:48.102\nSo if the display gets turned off\nafter a certain amount of time,\n\n312\n00:14:48.102 --> 00:14:50.910\nit's gonna have to be\nwoken up to get back in.\n\n313\n00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:56.280\nBut notice there's nothing in here that\nreally talks about a password, right?\n\n314\n00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:58.880\nSo put the hard disk to sleep,\nwait for network access,\n\n315\n00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:01.790\nenable power nap,\nnothing about a password.\n\n316\n00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:04.920\nAnd that's because it's actually\nburied under the General option.\n\n317\n00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:11.180\nAnd if we go under General, and, or\nI'm sorry, I'm in the wrong General.\n\n318\n00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:15.300\nIf I go to Security and Privacy, and\ninside of the Security and Privacy,\n\n319\n00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:17.388\nI go to that General, the other General.\n\n320\n00:15:17.388 --> 00:15:18.620\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n&gt;&gt; Here's what we get.\n\n321\n00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:20.650\nA login password has been set for\nthis user.\n\n322\n00:15:20.650 --> 00:15:22.660\nI do have a password.\n\n323\n00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:28.980\nAnd then, require the password, 5 minutes\nafter sleep, or screen saver begins.\n\n324\n00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:31.906\nSo if I've got a screen saver,\nor if I've got sleep configured,\n\n325\n00:15:31.906 --> 00:15:34.688\nthat powering off the screen,\nand powering down the system.\n\n326\n00:15:34.688 --> 00:15:39.240\nThen, if five minutes passes,\nthen it's gonna require a password.\n\n327\n00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:42.160\nNow, that means after\nthe screen saver comes up.\n\n328\n00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:43.620\nSo if my screen saver doesn't come up for\n\n329\n00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:47.920\n15 minutes, it'll actually be 20\nminutes before the screen locks.\n\n330\n00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:49.790\nSo I might want to lower that.\n\n331\n00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:52.843\nIn fact you might want to go immediate,\nright?\n\n332\n00:15:52.843 --> 00:15:56.859\nSo as soon as the screen saver kicks on,\nif somebody wakes it back up,\n\n333\n00:15:56.859 --> 00:15:58.882\nimmediately require a password.\n\n334\n00:15:58.882 --> 00:16:01.904\nSome people don't like that because Hey,\nyou're sitting there and\n\n335\n00:16:01.904 --> 00:16:03.113\nyou're reading a letter.\n\n336\n00:16:03.113 --> 00:16:06.002\nYou've been reading, reading, reading, and\nall of a sudden the screen saver kicks on.\n\n337\n00:16:06.002 --> 00:16:09.319\nWell, you can hit your mouse real quick,\nscreen saver goes away,\n\n338\n00:16:09.319 --> 00:16:11.330\nunless it's set to immediate.\n\n339\n00:16:11.330 --> 00:16:15.248\nNow they're gonna have to punch in\nthe password to clear it every time it\n\n340\n00:16:15.248 --> 00:16:15.843\ncomes up.\n\n341\n00:16:15.843 --> 00:16:17.210\nSo you might wanna set a little gap.\n\n342\n00:16:17.210 --> 00:16:18.550\n5 seconds,\n\n343\n00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:22.980\n1 minute, you can set something nice and\nshort to achieve your goal, right?\n\n344\n00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:26.480\nSo now if the screen saver comes up, I've\ngot a minute that I can hit the mouse, and\n\n345\n00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:30.200\nstop that screen saver from\nrequiring that password.\n\n346\n00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:32.700\nBut you can designate that right here,\nset t.\n\n347\n00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:36.730\nIf you unlock, you actually have a few\nother options that are kinda buried in\n\n348\n00:16:36.730 --> 00:16:40.430\nhere, like show a message when\nthe screen is locked, right?\n\n349\n00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:42.333\nSo it'll have a little\nmessage that pops up.\n\n350\n00:16:42.333 --> 00:16:46.390\nThat's useful if you think you're gonna\nlose the device that the screen might be\n\n351\n00:16:46.390 --> 00:16:50.700\nlocked, but somebody would see a message\nlike If found, please call blah blah blah.\n\n352\n00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:55.810\nYou can kinda define that,\nand disable automatic log in.\n\n353\n00:16:55.810 --> 00:16:59.720\nIf you care about password security\nenough to set a password for\n\n354\n00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:03.520\nwhen the screen saver kicks on,\nyou need to not have automatic log in.\n\n355\n00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:05.132\nSo, by having one option on,\n\n356\n00:17:05.132 --> 00:17:08.561\nwe can invalidate the other one\nif we're not careful, right?\n\n357\n00:17:08.561 --> 00:17:10.940\nSo, they don't play nice together.\n\n358\n00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:15.931\nGenerally you don't want automatic login\nif you're caring about your damn all\n\n359\n00:17:15.931 --> 00:17:16.470\nright.\n\n360\n00:17:16.470 --> 00:17:19.390\nSo once these are set, after that\nI'm in pretty good shape, right?\n\n361\n00:17:19.390 --> 00:17:20.671\nThere's still a matter\nof the screen saver.\n\n362\n00:17:20.671 --> 00:17:25.628\nIf I go into desktop and saver,\nhere's where I can set my screen saver.\n\n363\n00:17:25.628 --> 00:17:29.350\nAnd right now my screen saver,\n[COUGH] Is set to start after 30 minutes.\n\n364\n00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:34.010\nSo my screen will never go to sleep I have\nmy power options turned off because of,\n\n365\n00:17:34.010 --> 00:17:34.646\nwell, this show.\n\n366\n00:17:34.646 --> 00:17:37.920\n[LAUGH] And then I have a screen\nsaver that kicks on after 30 minutes.\n\n367\n00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:43.470\nSo if I walk away there's a 30 minute\nwindow that somebody could come in and\n\n368\n00:17:43.470 --> 00:17:45.530\nsit down at my computer and\nstart to use it.\n\n369\n00:17:45.530 --> 00:17:49.770\nAnd it's actually 31 minutes,\nyeah cuz that delay I set just moment ago.\n\n370\n00:17:49.770 --> 00:17:52.136\nSo we've gotta kinda figure\nout what's the best for\n\n371\n00:17:52.136 --> 00:17:55.493\nour environment we might wanna go\nmuch shorter on this like 10 minutes.\n\n372\n00:17:55.493 --> 00:17:58.835\nYou can do that just to meet\nwhatever your particular needs are.\n\n373\n00:17:58.835 --> 00:18:00.350\n&gt;&gt; Nice, very convenient.\n\n374\n00:18:00.350 --> 00:18:03.259\n&gt;&gt; There is another technology that we\ncan use called fast user switching.\n\n375\n00:18:03.259 --> 00:18:08.625\nAnd fast user switching is something\nthat a lot of Mac owners don't use.\n\n376\n00:18:08.625 --> 00:18:12.816\nWhen I get a Mac,\nit's mine it's my Mac right I don't share.\n\n377\n00:18:12.816 --> 00:18:14.630\n[LAUGH] It's not what we do.\n\n378\n00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:16.400\nBut, a lot of people do share, right.\n\n379\n00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:19.950\nMaybe you're a family so\nyou've got a spouse, the kids, and\n\n380\n00:18:19.950 --> 00:18:21.440\nyou all share one computer.\n\n381\n00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:24.190\nOr you're at a work environment,\nlike a school or\n\n382\n00:18:24.190 --> 00:18:29.270\na university, where you might be one\nstudent assigned to one computer for\n\n383\n00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:33.020\nthat class, but a different student will\nbe at that computer in the next class.\n\n384\n00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:35.010\nSo, those are shared computers.\n\n385\n00:18:35.010 --> 00:18:38.225\nAnd with a shared computer,\nwe can create more than one user account,\n\n386\n00:18:38.225 --> 00:18:40.254\nwe talked about that\nin an earlier episode.\n\n387\n00:18:40.254 --> 00:18:45.040\nBut with multiple user accounts, one user\nhas to log out and the next user logs in.\n\n388\n00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:47.320\nWell, what if I locked the screen?\n\n389\n00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:50.280\nIf I locked the screen\nnobody else can log in.\n\n390\n00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:52.438\nThey'd have to have my password.\n\n391\n00:18:52.438 --> 00:18:54.276\nSo a fast user switching does,\n\n392\n00:18:54.276 --> 00:18:57.820\nis it lets more than one user to\nbe logged in at the same time.\n\n393\n00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:03.030\nSo that if the screen is locked, I can\nleave the session running with all its\n\n394\n00:19:03.030 --> 00:19:06.240\napplications and things, but\nthen I can log in as a second user and\n\n395\n00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:10.580\nget an all new session and that's able to\nuse the computer and do what they needed.\n\n396\n00:19:10.580 --> 00:19:15.680\nFast user switching is a nice feature\nbecause it makes it really easy to lock\n\n397\n00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:19.600\nthe screen but not tie up the computer so\nthat other people are unable to use it.\n\n398\n00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:21.650\nAll right, but\nwe do have to turn it on, so for\n\n399\n00:19:21.650 --> 00:19:26.540\nexample, if I go into my System\nPreferences, and I'm gonna go into Users.\n\n400\n00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:29.619\nNow I'm on my regular laptop so\nI just have the one account.\n\n401\n00:19:29.619 --> 00:19:32.287\nWell, I got the guest account,\nI guess, but\n\n402\n00:19:32.287 --> 00:19:37.080\nI'm gonna add another account real quick,\nand so I'll add an account for Mike.\n\n403\n00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:40.080\nCuz, he might need to\nuse my laptop one day.\n\n404\n00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:43.515\nSo we'll give him an account\nwith a super secure password.\n\n405\n00:19:43.515 --> 00:19:46.067\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Which is mikestinks123.\n\n406\n00:19:46.067 --> 00:19:46.900\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And so there we go.\n\n407\n00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:50.290\nSo now Mike's got an account too,\njust like me, all right?\n\n408\n00:19:50.290 --> 00:19:51.260\nSo now we both have accounts.\n\n409\n00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:54.732\nBut if I lock the screen,\nMike can't really do anything about it.\n\n410\n00:19:54.732 --> 00:19:56.032\nThere is one thing Mike could do about it.\n\n411\n00:19:56.032 --> 00:19:58.794\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'll just power the computer off.\n\n412\n00:19:58.794 --> 00:19:59.705\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n413\n00:19:59.705 --> 00:20:00.750\n&gt;&gt; And power it back on But\n\n414\n00:20:00.750 --> 00:20:03.320\nthen any programs that I had\nopen I would lose my data,\n\n415\n00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:05.530\nI might get kinda mad about that.\n\n416\n00:20:05.530 --> 00:20:10.035\nWell Mac OS is really good about saving\nyour data during a failed shutdown or\n\n417\n00:20:10.035 --> 00:20:12.468\nwhatever so it'd probably be okay, but\n\n418\n00:20:12.468 --> 00:20:16.780\nfast user switching would allow us\nboth to be logged in at the same time.\n\n419\n00:20:16.780 --> 00:20:20.880\nSo if I wanna turn this on,\nif I go down here to login options.\n\n420\n00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:23.772\nUnder login options,\nyou'll see this guy right here.\n\n421\n00:20:23.772 --> 00:20:27.090\nShow fast users switching\nmenu as full name, right.\n\n422\n00:20:27.090 --> 00:20:31.600\nThis is saying, do we show and item up\nhere in the menu that shows a name?\n\n423\n00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:34.050\nNow, that wasn't there a moment ago.\n\n424\n00:20:34.050 --> 00:20:36.090\nA moment ago if you\nwill rewind this video.\n\n425\n00:20:36.090 --> 00:20:38.630\nMy name did not appear\nup here in the menu.\n\n426\n00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:40.310\nBecause I only have one user account.\n\n427\n00:20:40.310 --> 00:20:45.340\nBut the moment you create a second user\naccount, you get this menu up here.\n\n428\n00:20:45.340 --> 00:20:47.340\nAnd this is the first user switching menu.\n\n429\n00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:52.270\nAnd from here, what we can do is we\ncan say I'm gonna stay logged in but\n\n430\n00:20:52.270 --> 00:20:55.270\nI'm gonna switch to this other user.\n\n431\n00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:58.084\nAnd so that's what this option is\ncontrolling here is showing that menu.\n\n432\n00:20:58.084 --> 00:21:01.193\nAnd by default it shows full name but\nyou could change it to icon or whatever to\n\n433\n00:21:01.193 --> 00:21:04.740\ntake a little less space, cuz it does\neat up a good bit of space on your bar.\n\n434\n00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:08.090\nBut now If I'm doing something, right, so\n\n435\n00:21:08.090 --> 00:21:11.750\nmaybe I'm in Safari, and\nI'm doing something very important,\n\n436\n00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:16.000\nlike checking the sports scores, that I\ndon't wanna lose this page that I'm on.\n\n437\n00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.056\nAnd we'll watch some advertisement.\n\n438\n00:21:18.056 --> 00:21:20.777\n[COUGH] So I don't wanna lose\nthis page that I'm on, but\n\n439\n00:21:20.777 --> 00:21:23.030\nMike needs to use the computer real quick.\n\n440\n00:21:23.030 --> 00:21:28.690\nI can come up here and hit my name,\nand I can flip it over to Mike.\n\n441\n00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:34.275\nAnd now, here's Mike,\nand he can log in, and\n\n442\n00:21:34.275 --> 00:21:39.042\nwhen he logs in,\nhe's gonna have his own session.\n\n443\n00:21:39.042 --> 00:21:42.770\nI left Safari running, you can kinda see\nit in the screen imprint back there.\n\n444\n00:21:42.770 --> 00:21:46.080\nI left Safari running with\nthe ESPN page pulled up.\n\n445\n00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:48.540\nBut Mike's gonna get an all new session.\n\n446\n00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:51.870\nAnd so when he logs in, well it's\nhis first time logging in, right?\n\n447\n00:21:51.870 --> 00:21:55.270\nSo it's, I gotta say,\nI don't want to do an Apple ID.\n\n448\n00:21:55.270 --> 00:21:57.198\nWe'll skip past that,\nand then we'll get in.\n\n449\n00:21:57.198 --> 00:21:59.300\nHe's not gonna see Safari running right?\n\n450\n00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:01.490\nAnd all right we'll take a pass on Siri.\n\n451\n00:22:01.490 --> 00:22:05.628\nAnd eventually it's gonna ask\nus if we wanna import data and\n\n452\n00:22:05.628 --> 00:22:07.296\nall these good things.\n\n453\n00:22:07.296 --> 00:22:10.140\nBut eventually they'll get in and\nSafari won't be running, right?\n\n454\n00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:12.860\nThere's no Safari on this screen okay?\n\n455\n00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:17.070\nAnd if he launches Safari,\nit's not showing ESPN.\n\n456\n00:22:17.070 --> 00:22:18.590\nIt's his own session, right?\n\n457\n00:22:18.590 --> 00:22:20.710\nI'm still logged in to\nthe background though.\n\n458\n00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:22.240\nBut now, Mike has logged in.\n\n459\n00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:26.400\nSo I could come back up here and\nhit that Name menu.\n\n460\n00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:29.162\nAnd I can choose my name.\n\n461\n00:22:29.162 --> 00:22:33.647\nAnd now, it's gonna flip over to me and\nI can put in my password and it's gonna\n\n462\n00:22:33.647 --> 00:22:38.170\nreturn me back to my session and\nthere's safari with ESPN waiting for me.\n\n463\n00:22:38.170 --> 00:22:39.256\nGot two separate sessions.\n\n464\n00:22:39.256 --> 00:22:42.197\nOkay, so now I can have more\nthan one person logged in and\n\n465\n00:22:42.197 --> 00:22:46.150\nusing the computer no one person can\nlock it and take it away from the other.\n\n466\n00:22:46.150 --> 00:22:50.291\nThe other thing is if I'm about to get up\nand walk away I don't have to wait for\n\n467\n00:22:50.291 --> 00:22:51.700\na screen saver.\n\n468\n00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:54.395\nI can just come up here and\nhit my name and\n\n469\n00:22:54.395 --> 00:22:57.752\ninstead of Mike I can\nchoose Login Window right?\n\n470\n00:22:57.752 --> 00:23:03.060\nIf I choose Login Window,\nwhen I do that, it doesn't log me out.\n\n471\n00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:04.166\nI'm still logged in, and\n\n472\n00:23:04.166 --> 00:23:07.150\nI can tell that because of the little\norange check mark there, right?\n\n473\n00:23:07.150 --> 00:23:08.310\nSee the orange check mark by Mike?\n\n474\n00:23:08.310 --> 00:23:09.640\nThat was just means that we're logged in.\n\n475\n00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:14.245\nI'm still logged in, but now the screen is\nlocked in a way that somebody else could\n\n476\n00:23:14.245 --> 00:23:18.280\nstill use the computer, but\nall my stuff is still waiting, too right.\n\n477\n00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:20.220\nThis is an even better option.\n\n478\n00:23:20.220 --> 00:23:22.775\nBecause now as long as I remember\nto do it, I'm gonna get up and\n\n479\n00:23:22.775 --> 00:23:23.820\nI'm going to walk away.\n\n480\n00:23:23.820 --> 00:23:25.964\nI can lock the screen,\nmy data is safe, but\n\n481\n00:23:25.964 --> 00:23:28.062\nother people can still use the computer.\n\n482\n00:23:28.062 --> 00:23:29.470\nSo that's fast user switching.\n\n483\n00:23:29.470 --> 00:23:31.806\n&gt;&gt; Now, Don, you've said that you\ndon't like to wait on the timers and\n\n484\n00:23:31.806 --> 00:23:32.750\nyou like to do it manually.\n\n485\n00:23:32.750 --> 00:23:35.304\nIs that how you do it when\nyou lock your screen?\n\n486\n00:23:35.304 --> 00:23:38.098\n&gt;&gt; Actually, no it's not what I use.\n\n487\n00:23:38.098 --> 00:23:40.510\n[LAUGH] I don't use fast user switching.\n\n488\n00:23:40.510 --> 00:23:43.620\nSo when I have a device that's usually\nassigned to just me, so I'm not gonna\n\n489\n00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:46.940\nhave that fast user switching menu up\nthere to be able to use to lock it.\n\n490\n00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:50.274\nSo instead, I take advantage of another\napplication running in the background\n\n491\n00:23:50.274 --> 00:23:51.080\ncalled key chain.\n\n492\n00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:53.321\nAs you work with your Mac and\nyou start entering in passwords for\n\n493\n00:23:53.321 --> 00:23:55.985\ndifferent things like network servers,\nit'll offer to remember them and\n\n494\n00:23:55.985 --> 00:23:58.369\nwhen it does that it's storing it\nin what's called the key chain.\n\n495\n00:23:58.369 --> 00:24:00.459\nLet me show you the key chain real quick,\n\n496\n00:24:00.459 --> 00:24:04.284\nif you just bring up your It's actually\nthe last thing I pulled up here.\n\n497\n00:24:04.284 --> 00:24:07.960\nIf you bring up your spotlight,\nyou can search for key chain access.\n\n498\n00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:12.320\nAnd the key chain access utility is\ntracking all those passwords and\n\n499\n00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:15.250\nstoring them in a secure\nencrypted database.\n\n500\n00:24:15.250 --> 00:24:17.070\nNow, how does it encrypt it?\n\n501\n00:24:17.070 --> 00:24:20.740\nIt uses your password, the password for\nyour user account is used as the private\n\n502\n00:24:20.740 --> 00:24:23.230\nkey to encrypt the passwords\nin this database.\n\n503\n00:24:23.230 --> 00:24:26.900\nSo this is tied through\na user account's password.\n\n504\n00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:29.590\nAnd the key chain unlocks when you login.\n\n505\n00:24:29.590 --> 00:24:32.980\nBecause that's you providing the private\nkey to unlock the key chain.\n\n506\n00:24:32.980 --> 00:24:35.980\nSo the key chain can\nalso lock your screen.\n\n507\n00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:38.361\nBecause it's tied into that process.\n\n508\n00:24:38.361 --> 00:24:42.315\nSo, this is what I normally do is under\nkeychain access, if you go to Preferences,\n\n509\n00:24:42.315 --> 00:24:45.365\ninside of the Preferences you'll\nsee an option here that says,\n\n510\n00:24:45.365 --> 00:24:47.015\nshow key chain status in menu bar.\n\n511\n00:24:47.015 --> 00:24:49.788\nAnd what's that gonna do is gonna\nshow whether your keychain is locked\n\n512\n00:24:49.788 --> 00:24:50.353\nor unlocked.\n\n513\n00:24:50.353 --> 00:24:54.753\nNow, normally, when you log in,\nthe keychain's automatically unlocked, and\n\n514\n00:24:54.753 --> 00:24:56.810\nthen when you log out, it relocks.\n\n515\n00:24:56.810 --> 00:24:58.825\nSo we typically don't\nworry about it right?\n\n516\n00:24:58.825 --> 00:25:00.803\nAnd then most people don't\nwant this option on.\n\n517\n00:25:00.803 --> 00:25:03.891\nBut I like it because if I\nlook up in my menu bar now,\n\n518\n00:25:03.891 --> 00:25:07.654\nI've got a new menu bar item,\nthis lock that just appeared.\n\n519\n00:25:07.654 --> 00:25:10.797\nAnd if I click on the lock,\nI can lock my keychain, or\n\n520\n00:25:10.797 --> 00:25:14.060\nunlock it which we don't\nnormally need to do.\n\n521\n00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:17.350\nBut I can also lock my screen and\nthat's the part that I like.\n\n522\n00:25:17.350 --> 00:25:21.416\nI'll leave that up there, so that if I'm\nabout to get up, I just reach up here,\n\n523\n00:25:21.416 --> 00:25:24.730\nhit the lock, hit lock screen and\nthen it locks it, right?\n\n524\n00:25:24.730 --> 00:25:28.175\nSo, I kinda play a bit of mess with\nthe camera here, but it's gonna dim for\n\n525\n00:25:28.175 --> 00:25:30.960\na second and\nthen it's gonna go to the lock screen.\n\n526\n00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:33.645\nAnd as soon as it locks,\nnow I'm good to go, right?\n\n527\n00:25:33.645 --> 00:25:37.898\nAnd I can walk away and I don't have to\nworry about somebody sitting down right\n\n528\n00:25:37.898 --> 00:25:39.933\nbehind me and accessing the system.\n\n529\n00:25:39.933 --> 00:25:41.018\nAnd there we go.\n\n530\n00:25:41.018 --> 00:25:44.752\n[LAUGH] When you have a second monitor\nhooked up, it kinda behaves a little odd,\n\n531\n00:25:44.752 --> 00:25:47.538\nbut when it's on a single monitor,\nit pops up right away.\n\n532\n00:25:47.538 --> 00:25:50.810\nSo there we go, and now it's locked.\n\n533\n00:25:50.810 --> 00:25:53.905\nAnd I don't have the fast user switching,\nright?\n\n534\n00:25:53.905 --> 00:25:56.000\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; So Mike has an account,\n\n535\n00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:59.440\nfast user switching is on, but\nthat doesn't help him, does it?\n\n536\n00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:00.765\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n537\n00:26:00.765 --> 00:26:04.945\nsort of way down here is Switch User,\nright?\n\n538\n00:26:04.945 --> 00:26:06.855\nSo he could hit that, and\n\n539\n00:26:06.855 --> 00:26:11.155\nnow it's gonna convert us over to fast\nuser switching if you've got that enabled.\n\n540\n00:26:11.155 --> 00:26:13.860\nSo it does play nice across them.\n\n541\n00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:15.900\nThat is a feature that's available.\n\n542\n00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:17.550\nIt's up to you which one you want to use.\n\n543\n00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:21.830\nAll right one last thing that I wanna\nmention here before we wrap this one up.\n\n544\n00:26:21.830 --> 00:26:24.340\nAll these password stuff\nreally doesn't matter\n\n545\n00:26:24.340 --> 00:26:27.360\nif you have automatic log on turned on,\nright?\n\n546\n00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:30.310\nAutomatic log on is where you say,\nhey if somebody logs into or turns on this\n\n547\n00:26:30.310 --> 00:26:33.540\ncomputer, they don't need to provide\na password, we'll provide it for you.\n\n548\n00:26:33.540 --> 00:26:36.010\nAnd the way the laptop does that,\nor desktop or whatever,\n\n549\n00:26:36.010 --> 00:26:39.810\nis by storing the password on the hard\ndrive, so that when you log in, it just\n\n550\n00:26:39.810 --> 00:26:43.840\nautomatically provides it, thus negating\nany real security that password provided.\n\n551\n00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:45.820\nSo, that's a bad thing.\n\n552\n00:26:45.820 --> 00:26:49.299\nWe don't want to do it, But,\nif you wanted to set that up,\n\n553\n00:26:49.299 --> 00:26:52.120\nit's actually not that hard to do.\n\n554\n00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:55.820\nYou pull up your user account and\nlet me get logged back into this things.\n\n555\n00:26:56.960 --> 00:26:58.470\nAnd we're gonna go into\nsystem preferences.\n\n556\n00:26:58.470 --> 00:27:00.840\nLet me get out of all of this mess.\n\n557\n00:27:02.070 --> 00:27:06.360\nAnd inside of system preferences,\nwe're gonna go into our users and groups.\n\n558\n00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:11.130\nAnd inside of our users and groups, you're\ngonna go down here to log in options.\n\n559\n00:27:11.130 --> 00:27:14.990\nAnd under log in options,\nyou'll see automatic log in is turned off.\n\n560\n00:27:14.990 --> 00:27:16.530\nIt's off by default.\n\n561\n00:27:16.530 --> 00:27:18.270\nBut, if I unlock the settings,\n\n562\n00:27:18.270 --> 00:27:21.780\nbecause you have to be an administrator\nto turn this on, I can come in here and\n\n563\n00:27:21.780 --> 00:27:24.950\nsay I'm going to automatically\nlog in as one of these users.\n\n564\n00:27:24.950 --> 00:27:29.460\nAnd you can pick any user you want, but\nwhen you pick it, it's gonna prompt for\n\n565\n00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:33.410\nthat user's password cuz it has to\nknow the password to log in, right?\n\n566\n00:27:33.410 --> 00:27:37.840\nAnd so when I provide that password,\nwhere do you think that password is going?\n\n567\n00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:41.550\nIt's getting stored on the system and\nit's getting stored so\n\n568\n00:27:41.550 --> 00:27:44.815\nthat It won't prompt when\nit boots up the next time.\n\n569\n00:27:44.815 --> 00:27:47.935\nSo now if an attacker gets my laptop,\nall they have to do is turn it on, and\n\n570\n00:27:47.935 --> 00:27:49.105\nthey log right in.\n\n571\n00:27:49.105 --> 00:27:50.485\nAnd so that's a problem, and\n\n572\n00:27:50.485 --> 00:27:53.775\nif we're going through the trouble\nof configuring lock screens and\n\n573\n00:27:53.775 --> 00:27:57.557\nfast user switching, and all that,\nwe really shouldn't have automatic log on.\n\n574\n00:27:57.557 --> 00:28:00.937\nSo you not normally gonna use that\noutside of a home environment.\n\n575\n00:28:00.937 --> 00:28:03.697\nIn your home, that's probably fine,\nbut in a business,\n\n576\n00:28:03.697 --> 00:28:05.667\nin any environment that you don't control,\n\n577\n00:28:05.667 --> 00:28:10.117\nthe people have physical access to the\nsystem, you don't want it to be turned on.\n\n578\n00:28:10.117 --> 00:28:11.837\n&gt;&gt; All right, Don, and again,\nanother great look there.\n\n579\n00:28:11.837 --> 00:28:15.527\nSome of the great security features\nthat we can implement in Mac OS.\n\n580\n00:28:15.527 --> 00:28:16.327\nWe thank you for that.\n\n581\n00:28:16.327 --> 00:28:17.650\nI know we've got more to go.\n\n582\n00:28:17.650 --> 00:28:20.220\nBut unfortunately we're out of time for\nthis particular episode.\n\n583\n00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:23.070\nWe're gonna have to cut it there,\nwe'll come back with another part.\n\n584\n00:28:23.070 --> 00:28:25.920\nSo in the meantime, I hope everybody\nout there enjoyed watching this one.\n\n585\n00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:28.710\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n586\n00:28:28.710 -->

00:00:08.188\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.188 --> 00:00:12.720\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:13.750\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings, everyone and\n\n6\n00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:17.060\nwelcome to another exciting\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:19.970\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie, and\nin today's episode we are coming back at\n\n8\n00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:23.040\nyou with more of our\nMAC Integration Basic Series.\n\n9\n00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.980\nAnd joining us, well,\nmake sure that you get it right,\n\n10\n00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.350\nthis is 10.1 I'm too if I'm not mistaking.\n\n11\n00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:30.736\nThis Sierra update, and of course\njoining us in the studio, here again,\n\n12\n00:00:30.736 --> 00:00:32.111\nour good friend Mr Don Pezet.\n\n13\n00:00:32.111 --> 00:00:32.960\nDon, welcome back.\n\n14\n00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:33.930\nSir, how's it going today?\n\n15\n00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.990\n&gt;&gt; It is going great Danny, ready to\ndive right back into security, and\n\n16\n00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:39.220\nas you may have noticed we've\nswapped that old Mike for Daniel,\n\n17\n00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:42.660\nbecause\n&gt;&gt; On the better security host.\n\n18\n00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.202\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, there we go.\n\n19\n00:00:44.202 --> 00:00:45.510\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] What's he know?\n\n20\n00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.600\n&gt;&gt; We left off talking about a lot of\nthe security features that were a part of\n\n21\n00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:49.690\nMac OS Sierra.\n\n22\n00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:52.365\nAnd now, we're gonna kinda wrap\nthings up with a few really\n\n23\n00:00:52.365 --> 00:00:54.835\nReally important ones that\nare baked in under the hood.\n\n24\n00:00:54.835 --> 00:00:57.859\nA lot of the ones that we've talked about\npreviously were ones that were kind of on\n\n25\n00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:00.498\nalready, that we didn't really have\nto configure, but some we did.\n\n26\n00:01:00.498 --> 00:01:03.228\nMost of what we're gonna talk about here\nin this episode is stuff that you do have\n\n27\n00:01:03.228 --> 00:01:05.315\nto configure if you want\nto take advantage of.\n\n28\n00:01:05.315 --> 00:01:08.714\nAnd the first one that I want\nto talk about is FileVault.\n\n29\n00:01:08.714 --> 00:01:11.764\nFileVault was introduced and\nMac OS many many versions ago.\n\n30\n00:01:11.764 --> 00:01:14.800\nI think it was and 10.6, a long time ago.\n\n31\n00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.690\nBut it's changed a good bit, and\n\n32\n00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.340\nwhat we have in Mac OS Sierra\nis FileVault version 2.\n\n33\n00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.600\nIt's also what we had in the previous\nlike last two or three versions.\n\n34\n00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.890\nBut what it does is it allows us to\nencrypt the entire hard drive of our Mac.\n\n35\n00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.690\nAnd the reason I mention the older\nversions, Is that way back in 10.6,\n\n36\n00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:34.870\nyes, you could do FileVault encryptions.\n\n37\n00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:37.700\nBut it encrypted just your home folder.\n\n38\n00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.660\nHere with FileVault 2 we can\nencrypt our entire hard drive.\n\n39\n00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:44.110\nNow, why is that important?\n\n40\n00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:46.360\nWhy do I care if my hard\ndrive is encrypted?\n\n41\n00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.620\nWell, in the last episode, I showed you\nguys how to create user accounts, right,\n\n42\n00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:52.380\nand how we can do fast user switching and\npeople can share computers, and\n\n43\n00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.990\nyou can lock your screen.\n\n44\n00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.840\nSo, if I walk away from my computer and\nthe screen is locked and Daniel jumps over\n\n45\n00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.990\nhere and tries to use my computer,\nhe can't, screen's locked, right?\n\n46\n00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.810\nAnd well, all right,\nhe could power it off, and\n\n47\n00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.010\nmaybe stick a USB key on there and\nboot from a USB key.\n\n48\n00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:14.840\nMaybe he's got a bootable Linux installer\nor heck, even a bootable MAC OS install.\n\n49\n00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.250\nUSB key will let you do it.\n\n50\n00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.730\nYou boot off of that key and\nnow you bypass the operating system and\n\n51\n00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.700\nyou can browse the hard drive, right?\n\n52\n00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.660\nWell, we saw the firmware\npassword that you could turn on.\n\n53\n00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.350\nAnd if you've got firmware password,\nif Daniel were to try and\n\n54\n00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:30.990\nboot my laptop off of that USB key,\nit would prompt him for a password.\n\n55\n00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:32.710\nSo, we just stopped that, right?\n\n56\n00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:36.470\nSo, locking the screen, stop them from\ngetting in the machine while it was on.\n\n57\n00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.690\nHaving a firmware password stopped him\nfrom booting from alternate media.\n\n58\n00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.510\nWell, what's next, have we won?\n\n59\n00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.313\nNo, cuz there's still one\nmore attack that he can do.\n\n60\n00:02:46.313 --> 00:02:49.395\nIt's the fun one if where you break\nopen the laptop, it's not his laptop, so\n\n61\n00:02:49.395 --> 00:02:50.497\nwhat does he care, right?\n\n62\n00:02:50.497 --> 00:02:55.557\nYou take a hammer, you bash it open, and\nyou get at the storage media on the disc.\n\n63\n00:02:55.557 --> 00:02:57.233\nAnd you take that storage media out so\n\n64\n00:02:57.233 --> 00:03:00.260\nif it's a spinning hard drive\nyou can just pop it right out.\n\n65\n00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:05.200\nIf it is SSD some Mac's\nhave removable SSD,\n\n66\n00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.270\nsome Mac's have it soldered on to the\nmotherboard, in either scenario though it\n\n67\n00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:12.140\ncan be removed it's just a lot\nharder if it's soldered on.\n\n68\n00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.400\nBut he can remove that media.\n\n69\n00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.870\nAnd once the media is removed, he can take\nit and attach it to another computer.\n\n70\n00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.330\nA computer that doesn't\nhave a firmware password,\n\n71\n00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.920\na computer that he knows the password of.\n\n72\n00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.550\nAnd now, he can browse right in and\nget to the files.\n\n73\n00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:29.660\nThe files all right there\non the hard drive and\n\n74\n00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:31.770\nhe bypassed the operating system.\n\n75\n00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:32.710\nThat's a real risk, right?\n\n76\n00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:34.320\nThat's a real challenge that we face that,\n\n77\n00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.320\nthat could happen,\nespecially with laptops.\n\n78\n00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.290\nWhat if I forget and\nleave my laptop in a cab?\n\n79\n00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.658\nWell, somebody could get at it, right?\n\n80\n00:03:42.658 --> 00:03:46.600\nAnd the reality is most of us don't\nthink about setting firmware passwords.\n\n81\n00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.800\nSo, booting up in target mode or\n\n82\n00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:53.430\nbooting up off of USB media is enabled on\nthe majority of Macs that are out there.\n\n83\n00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.110\nSo how do we protect our data on\nthat drive to stop somebody who has\n\n84\n00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:59.710\nphysical access to the device,\nfrom getting at it?\n\n85\n00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:02.350\nAnd that's where whole\ndisk encryption comes in.\n\n86\n00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:08.200\nIf the entire hard drive is encrypted,\nwhen someone powers on the computer,\n\n87\n00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:13.710\nthey have got to log in order to\ndecrypt the drive and access the data.\n\n88\n00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:17.330\nAnd if they don't login, if they're\naccessing it from some separate computer,\n\n89\n00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:20.450\nthey bypass the operating system,\nthe whole hard drive is encrypted and\n\n90\n00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:21.860\nthey can't get at that data.\n\n91\n00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:26.280\nSo on any mobile device, like a cellphone\nor like a MacBook, like what I've got in\n\n92\n00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:31.100\nfront of me, It's really important to\ndo file vault dis-encryption right?\n\n93\n00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:32.650\n&gt;&gt; I come from more of\na Windows background.\n\n94\n00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:33.969\nI've been using a Mac for\na little while now.\n\n95\n00:04:33.969 --> 00:04:36.134\nBut I haven't really\ndelved into encryption,\n\n96\n00:04:36.134 --> 00:04:38.920\nit sounds very similar to\nsomething like Bitlocker.\n\n97\n00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:41.533\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's a number of solutions\nthat are out there Bitlocker in\n\n98\n00:04:41.533 --> 00:04:42.306\nthe Windows world.\n\n99\n00:04:42.306 --> 00:04:44.441\nYou've got Veracrypt in the Unix world or\n\n100\n00:04:44.441 --> 00:04:47.710\nLux or there's a few different\nones in the Lennox world.\n\n101\n00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:50.300\nSo, there's different\nsolutions on different OSs.\n\n102\n00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:54.330\nWith Apple they control the ecosystem,\nso they created a file vault as\n\n103\n00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.500\none solution that works really well and\nit's baked into the operating system.\n\n104\n00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.320\nIt's really easy to turn on, right?\n\n105\n00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:00.520\nLet me show you how it works?\n\n106\n00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.160\nI'm gonna take this install here.\n\n107\n00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.470\nI've got a Mac OS Sierra machine and\nthis is a default install.\n\n108\n00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:07.350\nI really haven't done\nmuch other than sign in.\n\n109\n00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:12.580\nThe iTunes store on it and what I'm gonna\ndo is go into my system preferences.\n\n110\n00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:16.654\nAnd inside of the system preferences,\nwe're gonna go to security and privacy and\n\n111\n00:05:16.654 --> 00:05:19.725\ninside of security and\nprivacy you'll see a couple of tabs for\n\n112\n00:05:19.725 --> 00:05:21.749\ndifferent security features, right?\n\n113\n00:05:21.749 --> 00:05:25.049\nAnd what we're gonna talk about a few\nmore of these as the show goes on but\n\n114\n00:05:25.049 --> 00:05:27.990\nthe one I want is this guy right here,\nFileVault.\n\n115\n00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:31.155\nAnd on my computer,\nthis is a clean install, right?\n\n116\n00:05:31.155 --> 00:05:35.120\nSo, basically I've formatted the machine,\ninstalled MacOS Sierra.\n\n117\n00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:39.186\nThen you can see, FileVault is\nturned off for disk Macintosh HD.\n\n118\n00:05:39.186 --> 00:05:42.530\nThis is a feature that\nis not on by default.\n\n119\n00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:44.900\nWe've gotta turn it on ourselves,\nall right?\n\n120\n00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:47.636\nSo, if we want to turn it on,\nWe can encrypt the disk and\n\n121\n00:05:47.636 --> 00:05:49.570\nit's giving us a warning here.\n\n122\n00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:53.580\nYou will need your login password or\nrecovery key to access your data.\n\n123\n00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:57.900\nIf you don't have that information, you\ncan't get at your data and it's encrypted.\n\n124\n00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:59.420\nSo even Apple can't get at the data.\n\n125\n00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:00.930\nIf you take it down to the genius bar and\n\n126\n00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:04.370\nyou say I've forgot my password,\ncan you recover my data?\n\n127\n00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:05.490\nAnd they'll say, I'm sorry.\n\n128\n00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:10.110\nWe can format the laptop and put a new OS\non there but we can't recover your data.\n\n129\n00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:12.500\nThat's basically what happens, right?\n\n130\n00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:15.200\nWell, getting it turned on\nis actually pretty easy.\n\n131\n00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:18.110\nNotice it's you didn't need to be an\nadministrator, so I'm gonna have to unlock\n\n132\n00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:22.300\nit, so let me just hit my unlock here, and\nhopefully I remember what my password is?\n\n133\n00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:25.580\nThere we go, and once we're unlocked,\nwe can jump in here and\n\n134\n00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:28.100\nturn on the FileVault.\n\n135\n00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:31.105\nAnd when we turn it on, there's a few\nthings that happen here, all right?\n\n136\n00:06:31.105 --> 00:06:33.283\nFirst off, in that warning,\n\n137\n00:06:33.283 --> 00:06:38.871\nit's telling me here that I need my\nlogin password or a recovery key, okay?\n\n138\n00:06:38.871 --> 00:06:42.930\nA recovery key is a really long code that\ncan be used in the event that you forget\n\n139\n00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:44.240\nyour password.\n\n140\n00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:47.740\nWell, if you forgot your password there's\nno way you're gonna remember this recovery\n\n141\n00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:49.710\nkey, cuz it's really long.\n\n142\n00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:53.830\nSo, when we generate our recovery key,\nit needs to be stored somewhere.\n\n143\n00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:55.690\nAnd you kinda get two choices,\n\n144\n00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:58.760\nchoice number one is you write it\ndown in a piece of paper, right?\n\n145\n00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:01.510\nWell, what happens if somebody\ngets that piece of paper?\n\n146\n00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:04.410\nThey've got your recovery code, so\nyou need to be careful with that.\n\n147\n00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:08.419\nChoice number two, you can store\nit in your iTunes account, right?\n\n148\n00:07:08.419 --> 00:07:10.740\nAnd so when I hit Turn on FileVault,\nthat's what it's asking me here.\n\n149\n00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:12.480\nAnd I keep saying iTunes,\nI mean iCloud, right.\n\n150\n00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:14.762\nSo, it's my iCloud,\nit all came from iTunes.\n\n151\n00:07:14.762 --> 00:07:17.450\nBut it wants to store it\nin my iCloud account.\n\n152\n00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:19.180\nNow, why would I wanna do that?\n\n153\n00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:22.450\nWhy would I wanna store my\nrecovery key in my iCloud account?\n\n154\n00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:26.230\nBecause if you lose access\nto your iCloud account?\n\n155\n00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:28.420\nThere is a password reset procedure.\n\n156\n00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:31.110\nYou can reset your password,\nit verifies you have your email address.\n\n157\n00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:34.090\nSo that it can send you a text\ncode to your cell phone.\n\n158\n00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:37.520\nOr you can answer some security questions,\nyou can do a password reset.\n\n159\n00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:39.130\nAnd now you can get\naccess to your account.\n\n160\n00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:42.050\n&gt;&gt; And you can get access from\nany web enabled device, right?\n\n161\n00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:43.260\nSo it doesn't matter\nwhere I'm at that point?\n\n162\n00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:43.870\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\nYeah.\n\n163\n00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:46.527\n&gt;&gt; So my laptop is stolen,\nI just borrowed Don's laptop.\n\n164\n00:07:46.527 --> 00:07:48.089\nI log into iCloud and there you go.\n\n165\n00:07:48.089 --> 00:07:48.885\nThere's my recovery.\n\n166\n00:07:48.885 --> 00:07:50.458\n&gt;&gt; Right, so\nthat's the big advantage, right?\n\n167\n00:07:50.458 --> 00:07:51.818\nYou get a lot of convenience there.\n\n168\n00:07:51.818 --> 00:07:53.137\nYou can recover your data.\n\n169\n00:07:53.137 --> 00:07:56.544\nOn a negative side, it means you're\nstoring your encryption key with Apple.\n\n170\n00:07:56.544 --> 00:08:00.122\nNow, it is encrypted with your iCloud\naccount and stored up there, so\n\n171\n00:08:00.122 --> 00:08:04.309\nit's just kinda like you're encrypting\nthe key that's encrypted your laptop,\n\n172\n00:08:04.309 --> 00:08:07.604\nit's like multiple layers,\nit's like that Inception movie.\n\n173\n00:08:07.604 --> 00:08:10.300\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; How many levels of dreams\n\n174\n00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:11.059\ncan we stumble through here?\n\n175\n00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:14.450\nBut you're trusting\nApple to store that key.\n\n176\n00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:16.430\nSome people are okay with that,\nsome people aren't.\n\n177\n00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:18.350\nAnd if you're not okay with that\nthen your gonna store it yourself.\n\n178\n00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:23.330\nAnd you'll see that option to say, allow\nmy iCloud account to unlock my disk, or\n\n179\n00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:26.950\ncreate a recovery key and\ndo not use my iCloud account.\n\n180\n00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:27.870\nAll right, now,\n\n181\n00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:32.540\nif I choose to use iCloud, the key gets\nmerged into my iCloud account, and\n\n182\n00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:36.170\nthen those are the credentials that I'll\nuse to be able to decrypt the disk, right?\n\n183\n00:08:36.170 --> 00:08:37.975\nBut in my case,\nI'm gonna choose not to use iCloud and\n\n184\n00:08:37.975 --> 00:08:38.990\nwe'll just store it as a key.\n\n185\n00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:43.050\nWhen I move forward, here's my key, right?\n\n186\n00:08:43.050 --> 00:08:44.380\nAnd if any of you guys\nare writing this down\n\n187\n00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:45.250\nfast-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n188\n00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:46.730\n&gt;&gt; You would know my key, right?\n\n189\n00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:50.470\nAnd if you came here into the building and\nstole my laptop,\n\n190\n00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:54.230\nyou could use this key to decrypt\nthe hard drive and get at it, right?\n\n191\n00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:56.592\nNow, notice that there's\nno option here for\n\n192\n00:08:56.592 --> 00:08:59.148\nme to save this to a text\nfile on the disk, right?\n\n193\n00:08:59.148 --> 00:09:00.588\nI can't just hit save.\n\n194\n00:09:00.588 --> 00:09:03.821\nAnd that's because Apple doesn't\nwant you to store it on this disk,\n\n195\n00:09:03.821 --> 00:09:06.060\nthis disk is about to get encrypted.\n\n196\n00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:09.520\nSo you're supposed to write this\ndown on a piece of paper, right?\n\n197\n00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:13.459\nNow you can highlight it and\ncopy it and paste it, right?\n\n198\n00:09:13.459 --> 00:09:18.448\nSo you can do that, but the key thing\nis if anybody gets a hold of this code,\n\n199\n00:09:18.448 --> 00:09:24.210\nthey can decrypt your laptop, so it needs\nto be stored somewhere securely, right?\n\n200\n00:09:24.210 --> 00:09:27.340\n&gt;&gt; So Don, I've got a quick question, does\nthis mean that we need this key every time\n\n201\n00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:31.420\nwe try to access data on our hard drive\nif we've done the FileVault encryption?\n\n202\n00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:34.179\nAm I gonna have to type this\nlong string of characters, or\n\n203\n00:09:34.179 --> 00:09:36.200\ncopy and paste it from my iCloud account?\n\n204\n00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:36.929\n&gt;&gt; Fortunately, no, right?\n\n205\n00:09:36.929 --> 00:09:37.445\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n206\n00:09:37.445 --> 00:09:38.764\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, and thank goodness, right?\n\n207\n00:09:38.764 --> 00:09:39.900\nCuz it is a long one.\n\n208\n00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:42.400\nThe only time you would need this key\n\n209\n00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:45.010\nis if you forget your account password,\nright?\n\n210\n00:09:45.010 --> 00:09:47.710\nBecause what it's actually doing\nis generating two keys, right?\n\n211\n00:09:47.710 --> 00:09:51.247\nAnd this is one of the keys on the screen,\nand then the other key is the password for\n\n212\n00:09:51.247 --> 00:09:52.480\nmy account.\n\n213\n00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:56.740\nAnd so, when I log in and I provide my\nusername and password, those credentials\n\n214\n00:09:56.740 --> 00:10:02.050\nright there are accessing the other\nkey that's able to decrypt the drive.\n\n215\n00:10:02.050 --> 00:10:04.620\nYou can actually issue many,\nmany different keys, right?\n\n216\n00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:06.969\nIf I have five different\nusers on this computer,\n\n217\n00:10:06.969 --> 00:10:08.643\nI would need five different keys.\n\n218\n00:10:08.643 --> 00:10:10.540\nEach user would need\nto have their own key.\n\n219\n00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:12.730\nNow, why not just share one key?\n\n220\n00:10:12.730 --> 00:10:15.430\nWell, what if you get mad at the user and\nyou kick them out?\n\n221\n00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:18.360\nWell, they still have a key,\nthey could decrypt the drive.\n\n222\n00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:21.560\nSo it's important that each user has their\nown key, so that if you kick somebody out,\n\n223\n00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:23.990\nthey can't decrypt the drive anymore,\nthat's important for businesses,\n\n224\n00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:27.505\nnot really important for individuals, but\nthat is how it works in the background.\n\n225\n00:10:27.505 --> 00:10:30.405\nSo this is just one more key, and\nnormally I'd write it down but\n\n226\n00:10:30.405 --> 00:10:32.338\nI know this is gonna get formatted later.\n\n227\n00:10:32.338 --> 00:10:33.528\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So I don't really care about it, and\n\n228\n00:10:33.528 --> 00:10:34.176\nI'll hit continue.\n\n229\n00:10:34.176 --> 00:10:37.623\nBut normally you write this down and\nstick it on a vault somewhere, stick it\n\n230\n00:10:37.623 --> 00:10:41.529\nsomewhere safe that you know somebody\ncan't get at it unless they're authorized.\n\n231\n00:10:41.529 --> 00:10:46.622\nAll right, when I hit continue, now,\nit's gonna ask me about the other users.\n\n232\n00:10:46.622 --> 00:10:48.492\nRemember I said more than one key.\n\n233\n00:10:48.492 --> 00:10:50.428\nThere was the key on\nthe screen a moment ago, and\n\n234\n00:10:50.428 --> 00:10:54.160\nthere's the key that's tied to my account,\nI've got a little green circle.\n\n235\n00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:56.760\nAnd now, I could turn it on for\nother users.\n\n236\n00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:59.530\nMaybe I want Christopher Walken to\nbe able to access my laptop, or\n\n237\n00:10:59.530 --> 00:11:02.210\nI want the help desk to be\nable to access my laptop.\n\n238\n00:11:02.210 --> 00:11:07.200\nI can then enable those users, and when\nyou do that, see how it's prompting for\n\n239\n00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:08.910\ntheir password, right?\n\n240\n00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:13.436\nNot for me to make up a password,\nthis is wanting their current password so\n\n241\n00:11:13.436 --> 00:11:15.563\nthat they can login to the system.\n\n242\n00:11:15.563 --> 00:11:17.655\nSo you might have think about and\nget that person and say hey,\n\n243\n00:11:17.655 --> 00:11:19.393\ncome over here I need you\nto type in your password.\n\n244\n00:11:19.393 --> 00:11:24.095\nAnd they'll type it in, and that's\ngoing to add their access to my key so\n\n245\n00:11:24.095 --> 00:11:28.880\nthat they'll be able to get in here and\naccess that data too, right?\n\n246\n00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:30.080\nSo you can punch those in.\n\n247\n00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:33.173\nAnd we can always come back and\nchange this later, but\n\n248\n00:11:33.173 --> 00:11:35.732\nit's always best to kind\nof do it right now.\n\n249\n00:11:35.732 --> 00:11:37.485\nAll right, so I'll go ahead and continue.\n\n250\n00:11:37.485 --> 00:11:39.070\nAnd then it's gonna ask to restart.\n\n251\n00:11:39.070 --> 00:11:40.910\nOkay, now, why the restart?\n\n252\n00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:44.690\nWell, there's a couple of things that\nare gonna happen here during the restart.\n\n253\n00:11:44.690 --> 00:11:48.580\nFirst off,\nalthough we call it whole disk encryption,\n\n254\n00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:51.550\nit doesn't actually\nencrypt the whole disk.\n\n255\n00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:55.641\nThere's one little partition that's\ncreated on the disk, it's a,\n\n256\n00:11:55.641 --> 00:12:00.144\nI believe it's like 100 megs or\n200 megs in size, very very small, and\n\n257\n00:12:00.144 --> 00:12:03.572\nit stores the unencrypted boot loader for\nmacOS, right?\n\n258\n00:12:03.572 --> 00:12:05.975\nAnd that's it,\nno personal data, no user data,\n\n259\n00:12:05.975 --> 00:12:09.642\nno operating system information beyond\nthe boot loader for macOS, because\n\n260\n00:12:09.642 --> 00:12:13.930\nwhen you press the power button on your\ncomputer does it have an encryption key?\n\n261\n00:12:13.930 --> 00:12:17.375\nNo, so it needs to be able to\nread the boot loader first.\n\n262\n00:12:17.375 --> 00:12:22.275\nAnd then, once the boot loader fires up,\nthen it can get us to authenticate and\n\n263\n00:12:22.275 --> 00:12:23.373\nlog in, right?\n\n264\n00:12:23.373 --> 00:12:27.168\nAnd now, its got a key so\nthat it can boot the operating system and\n\n265\n00:12:27.168 --> 00:12:31.817\naccess the rest of the drive, so it needs\nto test to make sure that's working.\n\n266\n00:12:31.817 --> 00:12:33.667\nAnd that's what this first\nrestart is all about,\n\n267\n00:12:33.667 --> 00:12:35.175\nto test to make sure that it's working.\n\n268\n00:12:35.175 --> 00:12:39.055\nAnd assuming it is, then it can proceed\nwith encrypting the rest of the disk.\n\n269\n00:12:39.055 --> 00:12:43.440\nIf it doesn't work, it can fail and\nstop before encrypting anything, so\n\n270\n00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:45.980\nyou're not locked out of your own data,\nright?\n\n271\n00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:49.730\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and hit restart,\nand when I do that, it's gonna reboot.\n\n272\n00:12:49.730 --> 00:12:52.120\nNow, when I boot normally, what do I see?\n\n273\n00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:53.530\nI see the little Apple logo, and\n\n274\n00:12:53.530 --> 00:12:56.610\nI see a little status bar crawl\nacross the screen as it boots, right?\n\n275\n00:12:56.610 --> 00:12:59.470\nSo we're gonna see some of that\nhere as this machine reboots.\n\n276\n00:12:59.470 --> 00:13:04.090\nAnd then we see the gray screen that\nhas our little user bubbles that show\n\n277\n00:13:04.090 --> 00:13:04.980\nup, right?\n\n278\n00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:07.920\nAnd each of the user bubbles there, these\nwill appear if we just keep watching,\n\n279\n00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:10.920\nit'll be a black screen here for\njust a moment while it reboots.\n\n280\n00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:14.210\nAnd then, we'll see those\nuser bubbles pop up, right?\n\n281\n00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:16.990\nAnd each user bubble\ncorresponds to a user.\n\n282\n00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:20.340\nWell, did you see the Apple\nlogo appear this time?\n\n283\n00:13:21.450 --> 00:13:22.420\nNo.\n\n284\n00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:25.510\nOkay, the Apple logo\ndidn't appear this time\n\n285\n00:13:25.510 --> 00:13:29.760\nbecause it hasn't read\nthe full operating system yet.\n\n286\n00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:32.530\nIt's only dealing with the boot loader,\nand\n\n287\n00:13:32.530 --> 00:13:37.810\nthe boot loader is just enough to\ndisplay this screen right here.\n\n288\n00:13:37.810 --> 00:13:42.776\nThis screen that shows me my user\naccounts, so I can pick my account and\n\n289\n00:13:42.776 --> 00:13:44.219\nput in my password.\n\n290\n00:13:44.219 --> 00:13:48.285\nAnd it needs my password because once\nI've authenticated it can unlock\n\n291\n00:13:48.285 --> 00:13:52.146\nthe private key that allow it to\ndecrypt the whole rest of the disk and\n\n292\n00:13:52.146 --> 00:13:54.590\naccess all of my information, right?\n\n293\n00:13:54.590 --> 00:13:58.370\nSo, that's why the log in screen looks\ndifferent once you've turned on FileVault.\n\n294\n00:13:58.370 --> 00:14:04.740\nAnd then once I provide my password, I can\nget in and go the rest of the way, right?\n\n295\n00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:09.518\nSo now, this is where I would normally see\nthe Apple logo with that bar going across,\n\n296\n00:14:09.518 --> 00:14:12.885\nbut now I see my account because\nI'm decrypting the drive so\n\n297\n00:14:12.885 --> 00:14:16.585\nthat we can actually read the OS and\ncontinue to work and boot up and\n\n298\n00:14:16.585 --> 00:14:19.030\ndo everything that we needed to do.\n\n299\n00:14:19.030 --> 00:14:22.720\nSo, the boot process changes a little bit,\nbut once it's up and\n\n300\n00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:25.850\nrunning, everything else is\ngonna be the same for us.\n\n301\n00:14:25.850 --> 00:14:27.530\nIn fact, once it's up and running,\n\n302\n00:14:27.530 --> 00:14:30.037\nit hasn't actually encrypted\nthe drive yet, right?\n\n303\n00:14:30.037 --> 00:14:33.590\nIt did a test there with the boot loader,\nso that it could recover ESE.\n\n304\n00:14:33.590 --> 00:14:37.080\nOnce it boots up, it's then gonna proceed\nto encrypt the rest of the drive, and\n\n305\n00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:40.030\nthe neat part about this,\nit does it in the background, right?\n\n306\n00:14:40.030 --> 00:14:43.687\nIt's basically just creating a,\nthat's an interesting screen, isn't it?\n\n307\n00:14:43.687 --> 00:14:46.227\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's creating an extra copy of each\n\n308\n00:14:46.227 --> 00:14:50.121\nfile, so my screen's gonna go just\na little bit weird, there we go,\n\n309\n00:14:50.121 --> 00:14:54.487\nbecause when you're doing that boot and\nthe video flips over it hasn't quite\n\n310\n00:14:54.487 --> 00:14:57.392\nloaded that driver yet,\nso that's what that was.\n\n311\n00:14:57.392 --> 00:14:58.757\nYou probably won't see\nthat on your machine,\n\n312\n00:14:58.757 --> 00:15:00.960\nit's cuz of the way I'm\ndoing my screen sharing.\n\n313\n00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:06.220\nNow, once it comes up, it's gonna\ntake me back to my FileVault screen,\n\n314\n00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:11.320\nand on my FileVault screen, here we've got\nwhere it's actually encrypting the disk.\n\n315\n00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:15.521\nSee how it says one hour remaining,\n50 minutes, it just got a lot faster.\n\n316\n00:15:15.521 --> 00:15:17.409\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You can't ever trust the time on\n\n317\n00:15:17.409 --> 00:15:20.435\nthese things, but it's gonna go and\nencrypt my drive, and\n\n318\n00:15:20.435 --> 00:15:23.600\nI can continue to use the system\neven while it's encrypting.\n\n319\n00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:25.910\nI need to minimize this,\nyou can even close the window and\n\n320\n00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:27.520\nit'll continue to do it in the background.\n\n321\n00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:30.530\nBecause what it's doing is,\nif I've got file A,\n\n322\n00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:34.830\nit creates a copy of file A that's\nencrypted, makes the copy,\n\n323\n00:15:34.830 --> 00:15:38.490\nencrypts it, activates it, and\nthen removes the unencrypted copy.\n\n324\n00:15:38.490 --> 00:15:41.499\nAnd then it goes on, and the next file\nit encrypts it puts on top of where\n\n325\n00:15:41.499 --> 00:15:44.100\nthe unencrypted file was to\noverwrite that data securely and\n\n326\n00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:46.147\nensure that everything is nice and\nprotected.\n\n327\n00:15:46.147 --> 00:15:49.538\n&gt;&gt; So, Don, I'm assuming at that point,\nthen I'm going to need enough\n\n328\n00:15:49.538 --> 00:15:52.424\nfree space on my disks so\nthat it can perform that function.\n\n329\n00:15:52.424 --> 00:15:53.895\nYou do need a little bit of free space.\n\n330\n00:15:53.895 --> 00:15:54.958\nYou don't need a ton, though.\n\n331\n00:15:54.958 --> 00:15:58.160\nIt actually gets by with,\nit's something really, really small.\n\n332\n00:15:58.160 --> 00:15:59.140\nI forget the actual number.\n\n333\n00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:00.790\n&gt;&gt; Cuz it's just doing\nthat one thing at a time.\n\n334\n00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:01.960\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and it's doing it in blocks.\n\n335\n00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:03.836\nSo it's something like 128K.\n\n336\n00:16:03.836 --> 00:16:04.443\n&gt;&gt; Wow, that is small.\n\n337\n00:16:04.443 --> 00:16:06.940\n&gt;&gt; It really doesn't need a lot of\nspace available to do its shoves.\n\n338\n00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:07.932\nSo we don't normally worry about that.\n\n339\n00:16:07.932 --> 00:16:11.160\nBut, well I guess they could be a serial\nif you were chock-a-block full.\n\n340\n00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:11.757\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Then,\n\n341\n00:16:11.757 --> 00:16:14.090\nyou could probably run\ninto an issue there.\n\n342\n00:16:14.090 --> 00:16:15.361\nBut, it'll warn you about that.\n\n343\n00:16:15.361 --> 00:16:16.882\nBut, it's churning along here.\n\n344\n00:16:16.882 --> 00:16:20.024\nIt's gonna encrypt, and in about two\nminutes, I'll have an encrypted system.\n\n345\n00:16:20.024 --> 00:16:23.599\nAnd the neat part here is,\nas far as the end user, the only thing\n\n346\n00:16:23.599 --> 00:16:28.340\nthat's different is when I boot up, I get\nto that user screen a lot faster, right?\n\n347\n00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:30.265\nIt comes up right away and then we login.\n\n348\n00:16:30.265 --> 00:16:32.380\nThat the only variation a user sees,\n\n349\n00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:35.460\nonce you're logged in,\neverything else runs like normal.\n\n350\n00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:37.510\nBut now, I've got protection.\n\n351\n00:16:37.510 --> 00:16:40.860\nIf somebody steals my entire laptop,\neven if I don't have a firmware password,\n\n352\n00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:42.260\nthey could steal the whole laptop and\n\n353\n00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:44.350\nI don't have to worry about\nthem getting at my data.\n\n354\n00:16:44.350 --> 00:16:47.190\nBecause I know it's encrypted,\nit's secured,\n\n355\n00:16:47.190 --> 00:16:50.175\nit uses AES 128 encryption\nwhich is very strong.\n\n356\n00:16:50.175 --> 00:16:54.023\nAnd, so my data's saved and protected,\nthat meets most government regulations and\n\n357\n00:16:54.023 --> 00:16:54.669\ncompliance.\n\n358\n00:16:54.669 --> 00:16:57.585\nIt actually goes beyond a lot of\nwhat the regulations call for so,\n\n359\n00:16:57.585 --> 00:16:59.060\nthat's really good.\n\n360\n00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:01.312\nIf you don't have\na firmware password though,\n\n361\n00:17:01.312 --> 00:17:04.914\nsomebody could take your laptop and\nthen just boot off a USB key, format it,\n\n362\n00:17:04.914 --> 00:17:08.145\nthrow another version of MacOS on\nthere and sell it on eBay, right?\n\n363\n00:17:08.145 --> 00:17:08.947\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n364\n00:17:08.947 --> 00:17:10.090\n&gt;&gt; And that's what usually happens.\n\n365\n00:17:10.090 --> 00:17:12.029\nWhen people steal a laptop,\nthey're not stealing it for themselves,\n\n366\n00:17:12.029 --> 00:17:13.205\nthey're usually just selling on it eBay.\n\n367\n00:17:13.205 --> 00:17:17.860\nSo, this type of file vault\nencryption protects your data.\n\n368\n00:17:17.860 --> 00:17:21.600\nIt doesn't protect your laptop\nfrom being resold or whatever so\n\n369\n00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:22.940\nwe definitely have to keep that in mind.\n\n370\n00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:23.830\n&gt;&gt; Yes, now, Don,\n\n371\n00:17:23.830 --> 00:17:27.510\nwhat we're talking about here is, I guess\nwhat we like to call data address, right?\n\n372\n00:17:27.510 --> 00:17:28.290\nIt's on the computers.\n\n373\n00:17:28.290 --> 00:17:30.015\nIt's not moving, it's not doing anything.\n\n374\n00:17:30.015 --> 00:17:34.254\nBut what about my data that is actually\nmoving, right, it's in motion?\n\n375\n00:17:34.254 --> 00:17:39.345\nIt's going from my computer to a website\nand a website back to my computer.\n\n376\n00:17:39.345 --> 00:17:40.643\nHow do we protect that data?\n\n377\n00:17:40.643 --> 00:17:43.155\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so a really good point there.\n\n378\n00:17:43.155 --> 00:17:47.651\nMy data is encrypted on the drive, but, if\nI'm copying something over the network or\n\n379\n00:17:47.651 --> 00:17:51.711\nI'm receiving an attachment by email or\nwhatever, when the data's read off\n\n380\n00:17:51.711 --> 00:17:55.290\nthe hard drive it's unencrypted and\nput into memory unencrypted.\n\n381\n00:17:55.290 --> 00:17:58.237\nAnd then it's sent over the network\nunencrypted to the other side.\n\n382\n00:17:58.237 --> 00:17:59.997\nAnd the other side might\nhave file vault also, and so\n\n383\n00:17:59.997 --> 00:18:02.877\nwhen it gets saved to their drive it gets\nencrypted again, but while it's in motion,\n\n384\n00:18:02.877 --> 00:18:05.600\nwhile it's passing between the two\nsystems, it's not encrypted.\n\n385\n00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:10.183\nSo if you need full end-to-end encryption,\nfile vault is one part of it,\n\n386\n00:18:10.183 --> 00:18:11.875\nbut a VPN is the other part.\n\n387\n00:18:11.875 --> 00:18:14.270\nAnd, MacOS has built-in VPN support.\n\n388\n00:18:14.270 --> 00:18:17.940\nIf I go back into my system preferences,\nand\n\n389\n00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:19.760\nyou kinda look at all\nthe stuff you've got here.\n\n390\n00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:20.850\nIf you got here in the Network,\n\n391\n00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:25.690\ninside of the Network is where we'll see\nyour physical network adapters, right?\n\n392\n00:18:25.690 --> 00:18:27.910\nSo, I've got an Ethernet\nadapter in this system.\n\n393\n00:18:27.910 --> 00:18:31.715\nIf I hit the little plus sign,\nI can add in another connection and\n\n394\n00:18:31.715 --> 00:18:34.265\nyou'll see that I've got the VPN option.\n\n395\n00:18:34.265 --> 00:18:35.173\nAnd if I choose VPN,\n\n396\n00:18:35.173 --> 00:18:38.933\nyou'll see where Apple supports several\nof the main standards that are out there.\n\n397\n00:18:38.933 --> 00:18:41.553\nRight, the layer 2 tunneling protocol or\nthe IP sect,\n\n398\n00:18:41.553 --> 00:18:44.360\nthat's used by a lot of\nMicrosoft Windows systems.\n\n399\n00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:47.590\nYou've got a Cisco IP sect,\nwhich use by probably by Cisco.\n\n400\n00:18:47.590 --> 00:18:50.080\nThey make that ASA firewalls\nthat are very popular.\n\n401\n00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:54.290\nAnd then, you've got IKE version two which\nis the Internetwork Key Exchange version\n\n402\n00:18:54.290 --> 00:18:58.230\n2, that, is a standard tunneling protocol,\n\n403\n00:18:58.230 --> 00:19:01.540\nthat's supported by everything,\nWindows, Linux, MacOS.\n\n404\n00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:04.710\nAnd so, that's the one that we like to use\nif we can, but these other tool is very,\n\n405\n00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:05.800\nvery popular.\n\n406\n00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:08.280\nSo Apple has support for\nall three built in.\n\n407\n00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:11.640\nVPN tunnels are what we use to\nprotect our data when it's in motion,\n\n408\n00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:13.130\nwhen it's crossing the network.\n\n409\n00:19:13.130 --> 00:19:17.271\nThese other technology out there too like\nSSL and TLS, the Secure Socket Layer and\n\n410\n00:19:17.271 --> 00:19:19.010\nTransport Layer Security.\n\n411\n00:19:19.010 --> 00:19:22.410\nThat's what you use with a lot of your\nweb and email traffic these days.\n\n412\n00:19:22.410 --> 00:19:24.005\nBut, those aren't enabled by default.\n\n413\n00:19:24.005 --> 00:19:25.066\nWith the VPN,\n\n414\n00:19:25.066 --> 00:19:30.830\nit encrypts everything that passes off\nof your computer across the network.\n\n415\n00:19:30.830 --> 00:19:34.233\nSo, that's the solution for\ndata in motion.\n\n416\n00:19:34.233 --> 00:19:38.547\n&gt;&gt; All right, well Don, we need to talk\nabout the actual protections, right?\n\n417\n00:19:38.547 --> 00:19:42.763\nSo a couple of, I'm gonna use the term\ngatekeepers, all right, and which is upper\n\n418\n00:19:42.763 --> 00:19:47.140\npaw because, one of those gatekeepers\nis actually called Gatekeeper, right?\n\n419\n00:19:47.140 --> 00:19:51.767\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we talked a little bit in earlier\nepisodes about how we have digital signed\n\n420\n00:19:51.767 --> 00:19:54.500\napplications like comes\nfrom the Apple Store.\n\n421\n00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:58.132\nAnd when you download an app from\nthe app store, you trust it.\n\n422\n00:19:58.132 --> 00:20:01.580\nIt's a trustable application,\nyou can run it and things work great.\n\n423\n00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:03.750\nThe example I used was Forklift, right?\n\n424\n00:20:03.750 --> 00:20:07.460\nWhere I went to the app store and if I\npull down Forklift, I can install it and\n\n425\n00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:08.990\nit can do all sorts of crazy things.\n\n426\n00:20:08.990 --> 00:20:13.440\nBut, if I go and\nget Forklift from the vendor's website,\n\n427\n00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:18.350\nit can actually do even more things than\nthe what the App Store version can do.\n\n428\n00:20:18.350 --> 00:20:19.910\nAnd that's because of the sandboxing.\n\n429\n00:20:19.910 --> 00:20:22.745\nRight, we were talking about it way back\nat the beginning of the security series,\n\n430\n00:20:22.745 --> 00:20:24.440\nwe were talking about sandboxing.\n\n431\n00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:27.130\nWell, there's another little protection\n\n432\n00:20:27.130 --> 00:20:29.790\nmechanism that we have in\nthere called the Gatekeeper.\n\n433\n00:20:29.790 --> 00:20:31.310\nAnd what the Gatekeeper does,\n\n434\n00:20:31.310 --> 00:20:35.990\nis it helps to ensure that only trusted\napplications are allowed to run.\n\n435\n00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:37.520\nOkay, now what do I mean\nby trusted applications?\n\n436\n00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:38.640\nWell, let me show you what I mean.\n\n437\n00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:42.818\nI'm gonna go to my system preferences, and\nI'm gonna go back to Security &amp; Privacy.\n\n438\n00:20:42.818 --> 00:20:45.830\nAnd inside of Security and Privacy,\n\n439\n00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:50.950\nwhat we'll see in here is actually tucked\nunder the General tab, here we go.\n\n440\n00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:54.780\nDown here this little box, and\nlet me just unlock here quick so\n\n441\n00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:58.160\nit will be all grayed out, there we go.\n\n442\n00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:02.910\nSo it says, Allow apps downloaded\nfrom the App Store, and\n\n443\n00:21:02.910 --> 00:21:04.830\nfrom App Store and identified developers.\n\n444\n00:21:04.830 --> 00:21:06.560\nRight, we've get two options.\n\n445\n00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:10.490\nNow, if you're coming from a previous\nversion of MacOS, which I assume most of\n\n446\n00:21:10.490 --> 00:21:15.160\nyou are, then, there used to be a third\noption here, which was anywhere.\n\n447\n00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:17.850\nAnywhere is gone now, right,\nanywhere doesn't exist.\n\n448\n00:21:17.850 --> 00:21:19.830\nSo now we just have these two options.\n\n449\n00:21:19.830 --> 00:21:23.241\nAnd what it's saying is that by default,\non your Mac,\n\n450\n00:21:23.241 --> 00:21:27.486\nyou can run any application from\nthe App Store and you'll trust it.\n\n451\n00:21:27.486 --> 00:21:31.760\nAnd, you'll trust any application\nfrom an identified developer.\n\n452\n00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:36.364\nNow, an identified developer is somebody\nwho has a developer account with Apple,\n\n453\n00:21:36.364 --> 00:21:39.849\nand every time they create a new\nversion of their application,\n\n454\n00:21:39.849 --> 00:21:42.039\nthey get it digitally signed by Apple.\n\n455\n00:21:42.039 --> 00:21:43.581\nAnd they actually sign it themselves,\n\n456\n00:21:43.581 --> 00:21:46.360\nwith a certificate that was\nissued to them from Apple.\n\n457\n00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:50.640\nSo, if they have a signed application,\nwe'll allow it to run.\n\n458\n00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:52.980\nSo you can download the application,\nyou can launch,\n\n459\n00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:56.310\nit will run and you're in business, okay?\n\n460\n00:21:56.310 --> 00:22:02.150\nBut, there are times that we need to run\napplications that are not signed by Apple.\n\n461\n00:22:02.150 --> 00:22:03.870\nWere aren't in the App Store,\n\n462\n00:22:03.870 --> 00:22:06.760\nthat aren't from a developer that\nhas a tight relationship with Apple.\n\n463\n00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:09.670\nThere might be, usually,\nsuits with like independent projects,\n\n464\n00:22:09.670 --> 00:22:14.360\nwhere Apple may charged too much\nmoney to have it in the App Store.\n\n465\n00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:16.032\nAnd so an independent developer might say,\nyou know what,\n\n466\n00:22:16.032 --> 00:22:16.909\nI'm just gonna do it on my own.\n\n467\n00:22:16.909 --> 00:22:21.020\nAnd, we'll throw it right out there and\nyou can download it and install it, right?\n\n468\n00:22:21.020 --> 00:22:23.645\nAnd if you go that route,\nwhen you run the application,\n\n469\n00:22:23.645 --> 00:22:25.775\nit's gonna be blocked by default.\n\n470\n00:22:25.775 --> 00:22:29.177\nNow you can get really strict and say,\nI only want apps from the App Store and\n\n471\n00:22:29.177 --> 00:22:29.775\nthat's it.\n\n472\n00:22:29.775 --> 00:22:31.485\nI'm not gonna allow installs\nfrom anywhere else.\n\n473\n00:22:31.485 --> 00:22:35.041\nNow like an iPhone or an iPad, right,\nyou're limited to the App Store.\n\n474\n00:22:35.041 --> 00:22:39.607\nBut, with identified developers, at least\nyou know that Apple is checked off and so\n\n475\n00:22:39.607 --> 00:22:42.005\nthese applications were okay to an extent.\n\n476\n00:22:42.005 --> 00:22:44.870\nThe ones from the App Store are the ones\nthat really get a good look.\n\n477\n00:22:44.870 --> 00:22:48.111\nThe ones that are from identified\ndevelopers are just ones where Apple has\n\n478\n00:22:48.111 --> 00:22:50.162\nverified the identity of who made it,\nright?\n\n479\n00:22:50.162 --> 00:22:53.297\nAnd they can ensure that it wasn't\ntampered with from the format it was when\n\n480\n00:22:53.297 --> 00:22:54.840\nit was signed, right?\n\n481\n00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:57.570\nBut if you download an application\nfrom an independent developer,\n\n482\n00:22:57.570 --> 00:23:00.150\nthat's where things get a little dicey,\nright?\n\n483\n00:23:00.150 --> 00:23:03.700\nSo for example, I have an application\nthat I use called Haroopad.\n\n484\n00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:06.499\nRight, Haroopad is just a little mark\ndown editor I use to write a lot of\n\n485\n00:23:06.499 --> 00:23:07.600\nmy notes in.\n\n486\n00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:11.220\nAnd, if you go to their website,\nyou can go and you can download it and\n\n487\n00:23:11.220 --> 00:23:17.520\nthey've got the MacOS binaries are buried\nin here somewhere, right here.\n\n488\n00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:20.976\nSo, they've got MacOS binaries,\nwe can download it as a DMG.\n\n489\n00:23:20.976 --> 00:23:23.795\n&gt;&gt; A little have a use the old style Mac.\n\n490\n00:23:23.795 --> 00:23:25.382\n&gt;&gt; This is a really old style.\n\n491\n00:23:25.382 --> 00:23:29.473\nBut, if we go in here, you can see\nI've already downloaded it here, and\n\n492\n00:23:29.473 --> 00:23:31.700\nif I open that up, it's a DMG, right?\n\n493\n00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:34.731\nIt's a disk image, so\nit's gonna mount it like a hard drive, and\n\n494\n00:23:34.731 --> 00:23:38.661\nthen I'll be able to browse into that,\nand then I'll see the application, right?\n\n495\n00:23:38.661 --> 00:23:41.577\nAnd like most installers,\nwe just take and we drag it and\n\n496\n00:23:41.577 --> 00:23:45.445\nwe drop it in the applications folder and\nwe just install the app, right?\n\n497\n00:23:45.445 --> 00:23:49.089\nBut when we did that,\nIt never verified a certificate.\n\n498\n00:23:49.089 --> 00:23:52.634\nIt never verified that it was signed,\nor from Apple, or from the App Store, or\n\n499\n00:23:52.634 --> 00:23:53.620\nanything like that.\n\n500\n00:23:53.620 --> 00:23:56.370\nIt's just some random application\nyou chucked in there.\n\n501\n00:23:56.370 --> 00:24:00.140\nSo the gate keeper is running,\nand it's looking for\n\n502\n00:24:00.140 --> 00:24:02.110\napplications that were downloaded\nfrom the Internet like that.\n\n503\n00:24:02.110 --> 00:24:04.510\nThat were downloaded from,\nwhat they call side loaded,\n\n504\n00:24:04.510 --> 00:24:06.060\nright loaded not from the App Store.\n\n505\n00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:11.910\nAnd when you try and run it,\nwhat's gonna happen is, if it was signed\n\n506\n00:24:11.910 --> 00:24:16.940\nby Apple it will allow to run right now\nbecause I have that option turned on.\n\n507\n00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:18.710\nBut, this was not signed by Apple.\n\n508\n00:24:18.710 --> 00:24:23.720\nSo, here we go, Haroopad can't be opened\nbecause it's from unidentified developer.\n\n509\n00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:26.670\nApple can't verify the identify\nof who ever wrote this.\n\n510\n00:24:26.670 --> 00:24:30.150\nAnd since they don't even know who wrote\nit, how can they verify that it's safe?\n\n511\n00:24:30.150 --> 00:24:31.143\nWho knows what's in this thing, right?\n\n512\n00:24:31.143 --> 00:24:33.690\nIt could have all sorts of crazy\nstuff running in the background.\n\n513\n00:24:33.690 --> 00:24:35.170\nAnd so, they're blocking it.\n\n514\n00:24:35.170 --> 00:24:37.400\nNope, sorry, can't do it, right?\n\n515\n00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:40.000\nBut it is telling me a little bit,\nlike where it came from.\n\n516\n00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:44.060\nSo this one actually came from\nanonymous S3 bucket, which, again,\n\n517\n00:24:44.060 --> 00:24:46.110\nAmazon doesn't guarantee any\nsafety on this either, so\n\n518\n00:24:46.110 --> 00:24:48.210\nthat doesn't make me feel any better,\nright.\n\n519\n00:24:48.210 --> 00:24:50.390\nAnd so\nat that point I can't run the application.\n\n520\n00:24:51.490 --> 00:24:53.700\nBy default, you are locked.\n\n521\n00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:56.720\nBut if you are an administrator, so\nI am logged in as an admin account.\n\n522\n00:24:56.720 --> 00:25:02.160\nIf you are an administrator, you can\nright-click on any app and choose open.\n\n523\n00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:02.860\nAnd when you do that,\n\n524\n00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:05.310\nI say right click if you've got\na physical mouse it's a right-click.\n\n525\n00:25:05.310 --> 00:25:06.930\nOtherwise it's control click, right.\n\n526\n00:25:06.930 --> 00:25:11.400\nSo if I do a control click, then,\nyou get the same warning, right?\n\n527\n00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:13.700\nHaroopad is from\nan unidentified developer.\n\n528\n00:25:13.700 --> 00:25:17.163\nBut instead of just saying, your settings\nprevent opening it, here it says,\n\n529\n00:25:17.163 --> 00:25:18.532\nare you sure you wanna open it?\n\n530\n00:25:18.532 --> 00:25:20.370\nRight, cuz I’m and admin.\n\n531\n00:25:20.370 --> 00:25:23.770\nAnd if I am and admin I can chose Open.\n\n532\n00:25:23.770 --> 00:25:27.050\nAnd by doing that it makes a little\nnote in the system and it says,\n\n533\n00:25:27.050 --> 00:25:29.440\nokay, we’re gonna trust this application.\n\n534\n00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:31.600\nAnd now the application can run.\n\n535\n00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:32.552\nAnd now we can get in here.\n\n536\n00:25:32.552 --> 00:25:38.270\nWe can type whatever it\nis that we're doing.\n\n537\n00:25:38.270 --> 00:25:40.390\nAnd off we go, right.\n\n538\n00:25:40.390 --> 00:25:42.100\nAnd the next time that I run it.\n\n539\n00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:46.100\nSo if I quit,\nlet me quit out of the application, right.\n\n540\n00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:48.870\nAnd the next time that I run it,\nI'm just gonna double click on it.\n\n541\n00:25:48.870 --> 00:25:50.910\nThis time I don't keep the warning.\n\n542\n00:25:50.910 --> 00:25:53.965\nIt has added an entry in\nthe Gatekeeper that says this is okay.\n\n543\n00:25:53.965 --> 00:25:59.570\nThe whole purpose of the Gatekeeper\nis to prevent drive by installs.\n\n544\n00:25:59.570 --> 00:26:00.840\nThere is a lot of websites and\n\n545\n00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:04.690\nother places that when you hit the website\nit has malicious code in the background,\n\n546\n00:26:04.690 --> 00:26:07.720\nthat automatically downloads\nan application to your computer.\n\n547\n00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:11.032\nAnd then, if the application were to run,\nit could encrypt your files,\n\n548\n00:26:11.032 --> 00:26:12.951\ndisplay advertisements, lock you out.\n\n549\n00:26:12.951 --> 00:26:15.150\nIt could do all sorts of crazy things,\nright?\n\n550\n00:26:15.150 --> 00:26:17.270\nBut Gatekeeper will stop it from running.\n\n551\n00:26:17.270 --> 00:26:22.700\nThis malicious software is not even\nallowed to run, unless we allow it, right?\n\n552\n00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:25.909\nThere was a ransomware attack called\nKeyranger that was out for Mac OS.\n\n553\n00:26:25.909 --> 00:26:31.940\nAnd it didn't hit that many machines,\nit was packaged as a Trojan horse.\n\n554\n00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:35.640\nIt was tacked onto a BitTorrent client.\n\n555\n00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:38.550\nAnd if you installed the bit torrent\nclient, yeah, it came from the Internet.\n\n556\n00:26:38.550 --> 00:26:41.280\nAnd so,\nyou would bypass GateKeeper to run it.\n\n557\n00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:44.830\nAnd then, it would launch the malicious\nprocess that would start to encrypt\n\n558\n00:26:44.830 --> 00:26:45.630\nyour disk.\n\n559\n00:26:45.630 --> 00:26:49.320\nSo, it basically tricked people\nto get around GateKeeper.\n\n560\n00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:52.980\nThe only way to bypass GateKeeper is\nto trick the person who's an admin.\n\n561\n00:26:52.980 --> 00:26:55.050\nRight and\nunfortunately that's all to easy.\n\n562\n00:26:55.050 --> 00:26:56.160\nSo, we gotta be careful there but\n\n563\n00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:59.290\nGatekeeper is s great process\nis running by default.\n\n564\n00:26:59.290 --> 00:27:02.370\nSo the only thing we do, is choose\nwhether we wanna limit ourselves to\n\n565\n00:27:02.370 --> 00:27:05.540\njust the App Store or\nApp Store and trusted developers.\n\n566\n00:27:05.540 --> 00:27:07.570\nAnd App Store and\ntrusted developers is the default.\n\n567\n00:27:07.570 --> 00:27:08.890\nThat's what it's set to.\n\n568\n00:27:08.890 --> 00:27:10.960\n&gt;&gt; All right, well Don that's\na very cool application, right?\n\n569\n00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:14.600\nSay hey, we're gonna give you some\nprotections to make sure that\n\n570\n00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:18.290\neverything that you can work with, unless\nyou're an administrator and you can verify\n\n571\n00:27:18.290 --> 00:27:21.490\nthe source then we're gonna try, and\nkeep you in a more a safe environment.\n\n572\n00:27:21.490 --> 00:27:23.517\nWe're gonna pad the walls for you, [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n573\n00:27:23.517 --> 00:27:24.778\n&gt;&gt; Don't want you hitting you head on\n\n574\n00:27:24.778 --> 00:27:26.224\nanything sharp or anything like that.\n\n575\n00:27:26.224 --> 00:27:30.120\nAlso, a thing we gonna\nwork with is the firewall.\n\n576\n00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:32.770\nCuz, people like me,\nI'm looking from the outside.\n\n577\n00:27:32.770 --> 00:27:36.547\nI'm not In your network or per se or\nnot in your computer per se, but\n\n578\n00:27:36.547 --> 00:27:39.724\nI wanna see if I can find any\navenues from the outside in.\n\n579\n00:27:39.724 --> 00:27:42.310\nAnd a firewall helps protect us from that,\ncorrect?\n\n580\n00:27:42.310 --> 00:27:44.928\n&gt;&gt; It does, and\nfirewalls are kinda a tricky thing, right?\n\n581\n00:27:44.928 --> 00:27:45.485\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n582\n00:27:45.485 --> 00:27:47.835\n&gt;&gt; Because a firewall is designed\nto sit on your network and\n\n583\n00:27:47.835 --> 00:27:50.820\ncontrol what traffic is allowed\nto pass through it, right?\n\n584\n00:27:50.820 --> 00:27:54.840\nWell, in an ideal world you\nhave a physical firewall that's\n\n585\n00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:56.860\non your network that's actually\nprotecting your system.\n\n586\n00:27:56.860 --> 00:27:58.420\nIt'll do a great job, but\n\n587\n00:27:58.420 --> 00:28:00.800\na lot of operating systems\nhave a software firewall.\n\n588\n00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:02.970\nA firewall that can run right\nthere inside of the OS.\n\n589\n00:28:02.970 --> 00:28:07.460\nNow technically, if somebody is attacking\nyour device, by the time it hits\n\n590\n00:28:07.460 --> 00:28:10.210\nthe software firewall, the attack\nhas already made it to the device.\n\n591\n00:28:10.210 --> 00:28:12.000\nIf we have a network firewall,\n\n592\n00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:15.390\nit's stopped before it even gets to\nyour device, which is the best way.\n\n593\n00:28:15.390 --> 00:28:19.080\nBut, there's no harm in doing\nwhich called defense in depth.\n\n594\n00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:21.060\nMore than one layer defense, right?\n\n595\n00:28:21.060 --> 00:28:25.660\nSo you might have a network firewall and a\nsoftware firewall here to control access.\n\n596\n00:28:25.660 --> 00:28:29.430\nWell, back OS does have\na firewall builded with.\n\n597\n00:28:29.430 --> 00:28:32.010\nIt is turned off by default but\nit is there.\n\n598\n00:28:32.010 --> 00:28:32.800\nAnd so we can go in and\n\n599\n00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:36.840\nconfigure that if we really wanna control\nwhat network access our system has.\n\n600\n00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:39.250\nAnd it's just tucked away inside\nof our System Preferences.\n\n601\n00:28:39.250 --> 00:28:42.640\nIf I go, let me get back into\nmy System Preferences here.\n\n602\n00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:47.250\nAnd if I go into Security &amp; Privacy,\nyou'll see a Firewall tab right there.\n\n603\n00:28:47.250 --> 00:28:49.720\nAnd notice that my Firewall is turned off.\n\n604\n00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:51.320\nAnd I know what you're thinking.\n\n605\n00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:52.420\nIt's my gosh, what?\n\n606\n00:28:52.420 --> 00:28:54.700\nWhy would Apple not have\ntheir Firewall turned on?\n\n607\n00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:57.260\nMicrosoft has their firewall\nturned on by default.\n\n608\n00:28:57.260 --> 00:29:01.090\nWell, the reason is,\nin Windows there's a lot of exposure.\n\n609\n00:29:01.090 --> 00:29:03.910\nThere's a lot of junk in there\nthat's just not properly secured, so\n\n610\n00:29:03.910 --> 00:29:05.890\nthe firewall helps to protect that.\n\n611\n00:29:05.890 --> 00:29:08.592\nApple's taken the approach of,\nlet's secure the OS.\n\n612\n00:29:08.592 --> 00:29:13.020\nLet's make sure the OS is really secure so\nwe don't need the firewall.\n\n613\n00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:15.830\nThat they don't have a bunch of extra\nservices running that don't need to\n\n614\n00:29:15.830 --> 00:29:16.740\nbe running.\n\n615\n00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:19.388\nSo we don't need the fire wall by default,\n\n616\n00:29:19.388 --> 00:29:23.657\nbut you start installing a bunch\nof applications, each application\n\n617\n00:29:23.657 --> 00:29:28.604\nstart increasing your text service making\nthe desktop more and more insecure.\n\n618\n00:29:28.604 --> 00:29:32.610\nAnd so, we can come in and\nturn the firewall on to help with that.\n\n619\n00:29:32.610 --> 00:29:36.780\nAnd when you turn the firewall on\nwhich is just a simple click, right?\n\n620\n00:29:36.780 --> 00:29:39.170\nYou can then go into the firewall options,\nand\n\n621\n00:29:39.170 --> 00:29:43.750\nyou can dictate what incoming\nconnections are allowed.\n\n622\n00:29:43.750 --> 00:29:47.060\nNow, by default,\noutbound connections are allowed, right?\n\n623\n00:29:47.060 --> 00:29:50.060\nSo if I fire up a web browser,\nI'm allowed to browse out.\n\n624\n00:29:50.060 --> 00:29:52.640\nIf I fire up an FTP client,\nI'm allowed to FTP out.\n\n625\n00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:56.100\nIt's connections coming to me, so\n\n626\n00:29:56.100 --> 00:29:59.570\nwe usually don't have connections coming\nto us unless we're a server, right?\n\n627\n00:29:59.570 --> 00:30:01.270\nSo you may not have anything in here.\n\n628\n00:30:01.270 --> 00:30:02.610\nI don't want any incoming connections.\n\n629\n00:30:02.610 --> 00:30:05.899\nI can block all incoming connections,\nright?\n\n630\n00:30:05.899 --> 00:30:09.764\nBut if I'm a server, if I got shared\nfolders or shared printers or\n\n631\n00:30:09.764 --> 00:30:13.985\nif I'm running something like that\nI'll need to allow those different\n\n632\n00:30:13.985 --> 00:30:16.680\nconnections to come in and\nhere I can do that.\n\n633\n00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:20.809\nI can control it, and I can dictate what's\nallowed to come into this system and\n\n634\n00:30:20.809 --> 00:30:22.280\nwhat isn't, right.\n\n635\n00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:24.280\nSo that's gives us that extra control.\n\n636\n00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:26.530\nIf you're just a work station though,\n\n637\n00:30:26.530 --> 00:30:29.210\nyou don't have any servers\nto provide access to.\n\n638\n00:30:29.210 --> 00:30:32.031\nSo, the only thing you have to worry about\nthere are things like shared folders.\n\n639\n00:30:32.031 --> 00:30:35.840\nSo you'll see here where\nI've got the shared folders.\n\n640\n00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:38.590\nIt was actually enabled by\ndefault to allow that access when\n\n641\n00:30:38.590 --> 00:30:39.100\nI turn the firewall.\n\n642\n00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:40.560\nAnd I didn't have to add that.\n\n643\n00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:42.890\nBut I can come in and\nI can add other things.\n\n644\n00:30:42.890 --> 00:30:47.560\nAnd when you hit the little + sign It's\nasking you to pick the applications.\n\n645\n00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:51.460\nWhat applications am I running that\nI might want to allow to pass through\n\n646\n00:30:51.460 --> 00:30:52.520\nthe firewall?\n\n647\n00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:55.480\nAnd then, whatever services start in\nthat application are then allowed to\n\n648\n00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:56.430\npass through.\n\n649\n00:30:56.430 --> 00:30:59.100\nAnd again, we really wouldn't see that\non a work station, but on a server,\n\n650\n00:30:59.100 --> 00:31:01.660\nthat functionality is there and\nit gives you that extra control.\n\n651\n00:31:01.660 --> 00:31:05.790\nDo note that it is turned off by default,\nso just be aware of that.\n\n652\n00:31:05.790 --> 00:31:09.580\n&gt;&gt; All right, well, Don, as you’ve\nkinda showed us here in this little,\n\n653\n00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:13.220\nquite a few little parts that\nwe have as far as security goes,\n\n654\n00:31:13.220 --> 00:31:17.370\nis that there are many options for\nus in security inside of our Mac OS.\n\n655\n00:31:17.370 --> 00:31:20.570\nSo definitely start learning around\nwith them, playing with them,\n\n656\n00:31:20.570 --> 00:31:23.678\nenable some of them obviously,\nthey could be very helpful here.\n\n657\n00:31:23.678 --> 00:31:27.700\nThat full file firewall disk encryption,\nthat's something that's easily done and\n\n658\n00:31:27.700 --> 00:31:28.670\ncan really help you out.\n\n659\n00:31:28.670 --> 00:31:30.990\nSo, I would suggest that one\njust right out of the gate.\n\n660\n00:31:30.990 --> 00:31:34.000\nAnd we do thank you, Don, for\nshowing us each one of those options and\n\n661\n00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:34.990\nhow to work with them.\n\n662\n00:31:34.990 --> 00:31:38.620\nHopefully, you guys got a lot out of this\nepisode but it is time for us to sign off.\n\n663\n00:31:38.620 --> 00:31:41.940\nWe do thank you for watching for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n664\n00:31:41.940 --> 00:31:42.576\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Don

00:00:07.849\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:11.669\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.669 --> 00:00:13.676\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone, and\n\n6\n00:00:13.676 --> 00:00:16.380\nwelcome to another exciting\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:20.770\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie, and in\ntoday's episode, we are back with more Mac\n\n8\n00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:27.146\nintegrations of version 10.12 that's\nright, we're up to 12 as it is today,\n\n9\n00:00:27.146 --> 00:00:31.900\nyou'll get see it and joining us back in\nthe studio, our good friend Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n10\n00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.110\nDon welcome back sir, how is it going?\n\n11\n00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.230\n&gt;&gt; It is going swell Daniel ready\nto talk about the latest and\n\n12\n00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.555\ngreatest in high tech technology,\nand that is, printing.\n\n13\n00:00:39.555 --> 00:00:43.020\n[LAUGH] It's kind of funny, I know.\n\n14\n00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.090\nA lot of us in the IT world kind of\nlaugh at it, that we've gone paperless,\n\n15\n00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.880\neverything's digital.\n\n16\n00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.155\nWhat do you need printing for?\n\n17\n00:00:48.155 --> 00:00:51.787\nBut when you get out there in the real\nworld and you're supporting a business or\n\n18\n00:00:51.787 --> 00:00:54.180\na school,\nyou'll find that people still print.\n\n19\n00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.088\nAnd not only do they still print,\nthey print a lot and so\n\n20\n00:00:57.088 --> 00:01:00.899\nsetting up printers on your system is\ngoing to be a routine task for you.\n\n21\n00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.544\nFortunately printing couldn't\nbe easier inside of Mac OS.\n\n22\n00:01:04.544 --> 00:01:09.504\nNow one thing we need to remember is\na little bit of Unix history right.\n\n23\n00:01:09.504 --> 00:01:14.226\nUnder the hood,\nunderneath the nice graphical interface\n\n24\n00:01:14.226 --> 00:01:18.140\nthat we have with Mac OS is BSD Unix,\nright?\n\n25\n00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.673\nAnd Unix is a very, very powerful,\nvery, very complex operating system.\n\n26\n00:01:22.673 --> 00:01:25.480\nIt is extremely non-user-friendly.\n\n27\n00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.200\nBut we don't know that\ncuz we get this nice,\n\n28\n00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.370\npretty user interface that makes things so\neasy.\n\n29\n00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:31.414\nThat's why Max OS has been so successful.\n\n30\n00:01:31.414 --> 00:01:33.440\nIt's got the power under the hood.\n\n31\n00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.223\nWell, one of the problems in the Unix\nworld, for years, and years, and\n\n32\n00:01:37.223 --> 00:01:40.157\nyears was that every printer\nwas treated differently.\n\n33\n00:01:40.157 --> 00:01:44.320\nAnd that meant that you had to know\na tone of details about your printer.\n\n34\n00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.003\nHow it work what features it had\nwhat drivers had a specialised\n\n35\n00:01:47.003 --> 00:01:48.280\ndriver's pelodum.\n\n36\n00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.696\nSome applications had their own drivers to\ntalk to the printers, it was a nightmare.\n\n37\n00:01:51.696 --> 00:01:56.580\nWell, when Apple adopted, OS 10 so\nthis is I mean 15 years ago,\n\n38\n00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.408\na long time they sat down and they said,\n\n39\n00:01:59.408 --> 00:02:03.370\nwe are gonna create a new\nprinting subsystem for Unix.\n\n40\n00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:07.010\nAnd they did, they created a system called\nCUPS, the common unit printing service.\n\n41\n00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:11.637\nAnd what cups does is it makes\na consistent single way to\n\n42\n00:02:11.637 --> 00:02:14.170\ninteract with printers.\n\n43\n00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.490\nAnd Apple actually release\nthis as open source.\n\n44\n00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:20.398\nSo a number of different projects,\nalmost every Linux distribution today\n\n45\n00:02:20.398 --> 00:02:22.950\nuses the CUPS printing system but\nso does Mac OS.\n\n46\n00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.154\nAnd that means that when a hardware\ndeveloper creates a new printer,\n\n47\n00:02:27.154 --> 00:02:30.040\nthey used to just create drivers for\nWindows.\n\n48\n00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.392\nThey'd say, yeah, most people run windows,\nnot enough people run Mac.\n\n49\n00:02:32.392 --> 00:02:35.754\nWell now, because macOS and\nall the Linux distros and\n\n50\n00:02:35.754 --> 00:02:38.979\nthe other BSD and\nUnix variance that are out there.\n\n51\n00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:43.545\nThey all use this cup system combined\nthey are big enough than most\n\n52\n00:02:43.545 --> 00:02:47.960\nvendors do make drivers for Mac and\nWindows on a regular basis.\n\n53\n00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:51.283\nIn fact it's pretty uncommon to find\na printer that doesn't have Mac\n\n54\n00:02:51.283 --> 00:02:54.934\ndrivers anymore and you can thank Apple\nfor that they rewrote that system.\n\n55\n00:02:54.934 --> 00:02:59.970\nWell, as a result it means that printing\ninside of Mac OS is really easy and\n\n56\n00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.390\ndrivers aren't something we have\nto worry about so much at all.\n\n57\n00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.377\nBetter yet, having to go out and\nfind and download, and so on.\n\n58\n00:03:05.377 --> 00:03:08.673\nLot of vendors do still make their drivers\navailable for download on their website.\n\n59\n00:03:08.673 --> 00:03:11.669\nSo I can go to the LexMark website,\nright, and I can download drivers.\n\n60\n00:03:11.669 --> 00:03:13.491\nBut most of the time, we don't need that.\n\n61\n00:03:13.491 --> 00:03:17.324\nBecause any hardware manufacturer can\nregister their drivers with Apple, and\n\n62\n00:03:17.324 --> 00:03:19.912\nthen you can just download\nthem straight from Apple.\n\n63\n00:03:19.912 --> 00:03:23.093\nAnd when I say you can download them I\nmean your operating system can download\n\n64\n00:03:23.093 --> 00:03:25.941\nthem automatically for you so\nyou don't even have to know about it.\n\n65\n00:03:25.941 --> 00:03:27.381\n&gt;&gt; That's the better way, [LAUGH].\n\n66\n00:03:27.381 --> 00:03:28.768\n&gt;&gt; It really is, you know,\n\n67\n00:03:28.768 --> 00:03:32.152\ncuz I have hard time remembering\nwhat kind of printer I have.\n\n68\n00:03:32.152 --> 00:03:33.547\nBetter yet getting in there and\ndoing configuration.\n\n69\n00:03:33.547 --> 00:03:37.275\nSo the main thing today is that\nprinting is easy and we have so\n\n70\n00:03:37.275 --> 00:03:41.100\nmany different options for\nhow we connect right?\n\n71\n00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:42.490\nUSB connections.\n\n72\n00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:46.490\nWhen you go and buy a printer, just about\nevery printer has a USB connection.\n\n73\n00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:48.300\nSo you can plug it right\ninto your computer.\n\n74\n00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:50.494\nNow at first,\nthat sounds like a great way to connect.\n\n75\n00:03:50.494 --> 00:03:52.220\nBut I'll tell you it really isn't.\n\n76\n00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:59.170\nWhen you connect the printer to a MacBook\nor a Mac Pro via USB only that one device\n\n77\n00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:03.540\nhas access to the printer, and it can turn\naround and share it on the network, right.\n\n78\n00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.160\nAnd then everybody connects to it.\n\n79\n00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:10.036\nBut what happens if I plug a printer into\nmy laptop, I share it out on the network,\n\n80\n00:04:10.036 --> 00:04:11.779\nand my laptop goes to sleep?\n\n81\n00:04:11.779 --> 00:04:14.000\nNobody can print to the printer, right.\n\n82\n00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.750\nSo they just lost that access.\n\n83\n00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:19.890\nSo that type of physical connection for\na printer is becoming more and\n\n84\n00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:21.180\nmore uncommon.\n\n85\n00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.920\nInstead, we normally take our printers and\nwe attach them to the network.\n\n86\n00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:28.252\nAlmost every printer that you'll find\ntoday will have a network jack on\n\n87\n00:04:28.252 --> 00:04:28.760\nthe back.\n\n88\n00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:33.625\nA physical, like a RJ45 connector for\nplugging in a network connection or\n\n89\n00:04:33.625 --> 00:04:35.381\nwireless or both, right?\n\n90\n00:04:35.381 --> 00:04:36.960\nWe've got a printer over here that's both.\n\n91\n00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.350\nWe've got a physical network jack and\nit's got WiFi built right into it.\n\n92\n00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:42.807\nAnd that way you can have laptops,\nand desktops, and\n\n93\n00:04:42.807 --> 00:04:46.147\nother devices all across your network and\nthey can all hit that printer.\n\n94\n00:04:46.147 --> 00:04:48.521\nAnd it doesn't matter if\none computer goes to sleep,\n\n95\n00:04:48.521 --> 00:04:52.400\nbecause you're not talking to a computer,\nyou're talking straight to the printer.\n\n96\n00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:53.768\nSo that's what we're normally going to do.\n\n97\n00:04:53.768 --> 00:04:58.400\nIf you have a USB printer then\nthis is the shortest episode ever.\n\n98\n00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.895\nBecause what you do you take the cable,\nyou plug it in.\n\n99\n00:05:00.895 --> 00:05:01.835\n&gt;&gt; And you print.\n\n100\n00:05:01.835 --> 00:05:02.834\n&gt;&gt; And you print.\n\n101\n00:05:02.834 --> 00:05:05.040\nYeah, it's as simple as that, right?\n\n102\n00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:08.220\nBut in a network printer that's where\nthings get a little bit different, right?\n\n103\n00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:10.206\nLet me show you here on\nthis particular machine.\n\n104\n00:05:10.206 --> 00:05:13.305\nSo I'm gonna go to my system preferences,\nand\n\n105\n00:05:13.305 --> 00:05:18.350\ninside the system preferences you'll\nsee a printers and scanners icon.\n\n106\n00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:21.010\nThis guy right here, and\nif I go into printers and\n\n107\n00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:23.450\nscanners, it'll pull up this list.\n\n108\n00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:25.048\nAnd I'll see my printers and scanners.\n\n109\n00:05:25.048 --> 00:05:27.208\nAnd there's nothing here.\n\n110\n00:05:27.208 --> 00:05:29.031\nIf I plug in a USB cable,\n\n111\n00:05:29.031 --> 00:05:33.880\nit'll detect the printer odds\nare Apple will have the driver.\n\n112\n00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:36.180\nAnd it will automatically show up here,\nand we're done.\n\n113\n00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:37.628\nIt's as simple as that.\n\n114\n00:05:37.628 --> 00:05:41.564\nBut if it's a network printer,\nwe've got to tell it.\n\n115\n00:05:41.564 --> 00:05:43.676\nWe've got to tell it that\nnetwork printer exists.\n\n116\n00:05:43.676 --> 00:05:46.679\nWell, there's a few different\nways we can tell it,\n\n117\n00:05:46.679 --> 00:05:51.061\nranging from super mega easy to a little\nmore complex and involved, right?\n\n118\n00:05:51.061 --> 00:05:53.965\nHopefully, the super mega easy part\nis the one that's gonna work for us.\n\n119\n00:05:53.965 --> 00:05:57.482\nEvery Mac has a protocol\non it called Bonjour.\n\n120\n00:05:57.482 --> 00:06:00.811\nAnd Bonjour is a discovery protocol,\nit searches your network and\n\n121\n00:06:00.811 --> 00:06:03.663\nit looks for stuff, and\nwhen I say stuff I mean printers,\n\n122\n00:06:03.663 --> 00:06:05.579\nright what we're talking about now.\n\n123\n00:06:05.579 --> 00:06:09.653\nBut it also looks for things like network\nconnected speakers, time machine,\n\n124\n00:06:09.653 --> 00:06:13.972\nthe network airport, time machine backups,\ntime capsules, so it's looking for\n\n125\n00:06:13.972 --> 00:06:15.350\nother Windows machines.\n\n126\n00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:18.721\nIt's looking for shared folders, it's just\ntrying to discover stuff on the network.\n\n127\n00:06:18.721 --> 00:06:23.626\nAnd if your printer is Bonjour-compatible,\nit'll find it right?\n\n128\n00:06:23.626 --> 00:06:27.520\nYour Mac will find it, and it's just\na matter of picking it out of a list.\n\n129\n00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:30.491\nSo when I hit this little\nplus-sign button to add a printer,\n\n130\n00:06:30.491 --> 00:06:32.073\nit's gonna search my network.\n\n131\n00:06:32.073 --> 00:06:34.383\nAnd see how I've already\nfound three printers and\n\n132\n00:06:34.383 --> 00:06:35.927\nI just hit the plus sign, right?\n\n133\n00:06:35.927 --> 00:06:40.470\nAnd over here I can see Bonjour,\nBonjour Shared, and Bonjour.\n\n134\n00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:41.945\nI see three printers.\n\n135\n00:06:41.945 --> 00:06:47.470\nWell, what I actually see our two\nprinters and one computer, right.\n\n136\n00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:52.094\nThis first one, is an HP Color Laser\nJet M553, I have no idea what that is.\n\n137\n00:06:52.094 --> 00:06:54.114\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It sounds fancy.\n\n138\n00:06:54.114 --> 00:06:55.960\n&gt;&gt; It's a color printer, I know that.\n\n139\n00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:59.614\nActually I do know that this is\na printer in Tim's office cuz he's got\n\n140\n00:06:59.614 --> 00:07:00.437\nthe color one.\n\n141\n00:07:00.437 --> 00:07:03.510\nSo this one in Tim's office\nhere in our building.\n\n142\n00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:05.200\nAnd we found that via Bonjour.\n\n143\n00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:08.044\nI can see his printer directly.\n\n144\n00:07:08.044 --> 00:07:14.150\nThe bottom one, ITProTV Office BW HP\nLaser Jet M506, I know that printer.\n\n145\n00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:16.634\nThat's the printer I\nprint my show notes on.\n\n146\n00:07:16.634 --> 00:07:19.697\nSo that's the printer over\nhere by our host tables, and\n\n147\n00:07:19.697 --> 00:07:23.420\nis that one I see directly,\nI can talk to it directly, right?\n\n148\n00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:27.290\nThose printers are natively\nrunning Bonjour.\n\n149\n00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:28.565\nAnd so we're able to find them and\ndiscover them.\n\n150\n00:07:28.565 --> 00:07:34.172\nThis other one though,\nit's a HP LaserJet 400 M401dne, right?\n\n151\n00:07:34.172 --> 00:07:38.317\nAnd it more than likely supports Bonjour.\n\n152\n00:07:38.317 --> 00:07:43.843\nBut I'm not finding it that way, because\nnotice hot it says @Editing Station.\n\n153\n00:07:43.843 --> 00:07:48.442\nThis printer must have been hooked\nup to one of our editing stations.\n\n154\n00:07:48.442 --> 00:07:51.000\nWe've got couple of editing computers\nback there for when they edit our videos.\n\n155\n00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.690\nAnd they've got a printer hooked\nup to one of those machines.\n\n156\n00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:54.835\nA machine called editing station.\n\n157\n00:07:54.835 --> 00:07:56.633\nAnd it's shared out.\n\n158\n00:07:56.633 --> 00:07:59.647\nAnd so\nI'm seeing it through that computer.\n\n159\n00:07:59.647 --> 00:08:03.037\nNow if they were to shut that\ncomputer off, if we were to go and\n\n160\n00:08:03.037 --> 00:08:05.902\nshut off the editing station then,\nwhat happens?\n\n161\n00:08:05.902 --> 00:08:08.600\nThat printer goes away and\nI can't get to it, okay.\n\n162\n00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:12.560\nSo that's the problem with having\na physical connection to a printer like\n\n163\n00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:16.330\nthat, is it's tied to that computer and\nwe can lose that access, all right.\n\n164\n00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:19.140\nBut the nice thing here is if I wanna\nprint, let's say I wanna print to that\n\n165\n00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:21.230\nblack and white printer, right,\nor I'll do the color one.\n\n166\n00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:22.980\nWe're gonna print to Tim's printer.\n\n167\n00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:23.520\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, he'll love it.\n\n168\n00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:26.110\n&gt;&gt; He'll sit there wondering what's all\nthis stuff coming out of the printer?\n\n169\n00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:30.160\nWhen you choose it, right down here you'll\nsee where you can specify a name for it so\n\n170\n00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:31.000\nyou can remember it.\n\n171\n00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.954\nAnd when I look at this\nHP Color LaserJet M553.\n\n172\n00:08:34.954 --> 00:08:36.255\nWhat does that mean, right?\n\n173\n00:08:36.255 --> 00:08:39.151\nThat might not mean anything to me,\nso I might even come in here and\n\n174\n00:08:39.151 --> 00:08:41.110\nchange that and say this is Tim's printer.\n\n175\n00:08:43.770 --> 00:08:44.730\nI can remember that.\n\n176\n00:08:44.730 --> 00:08:45.690\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; I wanna print,\n\n177\n00:08:45.690 --> 00:08:47.070\nwhich printer do I wanna print to?\n\n178\n00:08:47.070 --> 00:08:48.830\nTim's printer, let me do that.\n\n179\n00:08:48.830 --> 00:08:50.380\nAnd where is it located?\n\n180\n00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:52.038\nWell, we don’t have a really\nbig office here, so\n\n181\n00:08:52.038 --> 00:08:54.066\nI normally just type something\nlike Tim’s office, right?\n\n182\n00:08:54.066 --> 00:08:55.227\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Which I kind of already know,\n\n183\n00:08:55.227 --> 00:08:56.184\ncuz I put Tim’s Printer, right?\n\n184\n00:08:56.184 --> 00:08:58.260\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But let’s say you’re in a hospital.\n\n185\n00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.333\n&gt;&gt; Tim’s Printer, in the break room.\n\n186\n00:09:00.333 --> 00:09:01.058\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So\n\n187\n00:09:01.058 --> 00:09:05.225\nthis might be in room 1401 or\nwhatever it is, right?\n\n188\n00:09:05.225 --> 00:09:10.709\nSo you’d kinda put in however it is\nthat you identify where that printer is,\n\n189\n00:09:10.709 --> 00:09:13.463\nso you can go there and find it, okay?\n\n190\n00:09:13.463 --> 00:09:16.210\nSo I'm gonna punch that in,\nI'm just gonna hit Add.\n\n191\n00:09:16.210 --> 00:09:19.780\nAnd when I do that, it's setting it up.\n\n192\n00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:22.130\nAnd did it ask me for a driver?\n\n193\n00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:26.520\nNo, it knew the printer and the driver\nwas registered with Apple and so\n\n194\n00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:27.920\nit's already loaded it.\n\n195\n00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:30.560\nIt even got a little picture,\nthat's what Tim's printer looks like.\n\n196\n00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:34.090\nRight, see,\nit's got the little HP logo right there.\n\n197\n00:09:34.090 --> 00:09:36.050\nThey're actually trying to pull that in.\n\n198\n00:09:36.050 --> 00:09:38.730\nIf I were to add the other one,\nthat black and white printer,\n\n199\n00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:41.580\nit would come come in and actually looks\ndifferent, we'll see it in a minute.\n\n200\n00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:46.413\nBut it's added, and here it shows\nas in Room 1401, Tim's Printer.\n\n201\n00:09:46.413 --> 00:09:49.327\nI've got that printer right here,\nand it's ready to rock, right?\n\n202\n00:09:49.327 --> 00:09:50.590\nThat's what Bonjour does.\n\n203\n00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:52.450\nBonjour really helps with that.\n\n204\n00:09:52.450 --> 00:09:55.116\nThere's another protocol you might see\nthat helps with that too which is called\n\n205\n00:09:55.116 --> 00:09:55.809\nAirPrint, right?\n\n206\n00:09:55.809 --> 00:09:59.554\nIf you have an iPad, iPad's don't let\nyou install hardware drivers into them,\n\n207\n00:09:59.554 --> 00:10:02.400\nthey either have the driver or they don't.\n\n208\n00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:06.490\nSo what a lot of printer manufacturers\ndid is they said, look, if we can't load\n\n209\n00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:09.230\na driver onto these tablets,\nhow are we supposed to let them print?\n\n210\n00:10:09.230 --> 00:10:12.630\nAnd Apple said, well how about this,\nwe'll create a protocol called AirPrint.\n\n211\n00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:15.890\nAnd we'll create print jobs\nalways in this one format.\n\n212\n00:10:15.890 --> 00:10:17.250\nAnd we can send it to your printer, and\n\n213\n00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:19.840\nyour printer can then take it and\nreformat it however needed.\n\n214\n00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:24.010\nAnd so anybody who manufactures a printer,\ncan make it AirPrint compatible.\n\n215\n00:10:24.010 --> 00:10:26.843\nAnd when we do that, you can go to\nan iPad or an iPhone and you'll\n\n216\n00:10:26.843 --> 00:10:30.591\nfind the printer and it can print to it,\nno problem without loading drivers at all.\n\n217\n00:10:30.591 --> 00:10:33.025\nBecause there's just one format, AirPrint.\n\n218\n00:10:33.025 --> 00:10:34.850\n&gt;&gt; We just use AirPrint for everything?\n\n219\n00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:35.584\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n220\n00:10:35.584 --> 00:10:39.205\ngood question right, so\nI use Bonjour here why not AirPrint?\n\n221\n00:10:39.205 --> 00:10:43.300\nWell, AirPrint doesn't know anything at\n\n222\n00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:46.670\nall about the printer it's printing\nto other than it's IP address, right?\n\n223\n00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:49.640\nIt knows it exists, it doesn't know\nif it's color or black and white.\n\n224\n00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:52.348\nIt doesn't know if it has a stapler or\na hole puncher.\n\n225\n00:10:52.348 --> 00:10:54.570\nIt doesn't know if it has multiple trays,\nit's just says,\n\n226\n00:10:54.570 --> 00:10:56.670\nhere's a job, print it for me, right?\n\n227\n00:10:56.670 --> 00:11:00.282\nWith Bonjour,\nwe can learn all about that printer.\n\n228\n00:11:00.282 --> 00:11:03.426\nBecause, hey, our printer here,\nthis is a simple one but Daniel, you of\n\n229\n00:11:03.426 --> 00:11:07.310\nanybody here in this company know printers\ncan have a lot of crazy features, right?\n\n230\n00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:08.808\n&gt;&gt; Yeah they get super crazy.\n\n231\n00:11:08.808 --> 00:11:12.590\nI mean, just think about things like\naccounting they have specific check\n\n232\n00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:14.977\nprinters, trays for\nthe right kind of paper.\n\n233\n00:11:14.977 --> 00:11:19.380\nYou name it, they get a really crazy,\ncollation, stapling.\n\n234\n00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:22.310\nAll these features are something that,\nif you're in a larger office environment\n\n235\n00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:24.571\nthey're probably gonna want to\ntake advantage of that stuff.\n\n236\n00:11:24.571 --> 00:11:26.221\nHence the reason why they got it.\n\n237\n00:11:26.221 --> 00:11:26.875\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n238\n00:11:26.875 --> 00:11:31.300\nyeah, just shoveling jobs to it is nice to\nbe able to do it from a phone or an iPad.\n\n239\n00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:34.090\nBut yeah, you're gonna want to take\nadvantage of all the functionality that\n\n240\n00:11:34.090 --> 00:11:35.300\nyou have inside of your printer.\n\n241\n00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:39.140\n&gt;&gt; Right, and with AirPrint it's really\ndesigned for wireless networks too.\n\n242\n00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:42.230\nIt's really designed for\nthat come and go type of network.\n\n243\n00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:45.310\nAirPrint does work over regular wireless,\nit also works over Bluetooth.\n\n244\n00:11:45.310 --> 00:11:48.360\nYou can Bluetooth connect to a printer and\nprint to it that way.\n\n245\n00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:51.710\nNot as common because it's kind of a pain\nto connect to something via Bluetooth.\n\n246\n00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:54.910\nYou have to physical access and you gotta\npunch in the code and all that mess.\n\n247\n00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:56.512\nSo but that support is there.\n\n248\n00:11:56.512 --> 00:12:03.720\nSo you've got regular Wi-Fi,\nwhich is like 802.11 A, B, G, N, AC, B.\n\n249\n00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:04.314\nThere's another one.\n\n250\n00:12:04.314 --> 00:12:05.305\n&gt;&gt; There's another one.\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n\n251\n00:12:05.305 --> 00:12:07.483\n&gt;&gt; AF or something like that whatever,\n\n252\n00:12:07.483 --> 00:12:08.995\nnew stuff all the time.\n\n253\n00:12:08.995 --> 00:12:12.295\nThere's all those, there's Bluetooth,\nthere's different wireless connectivity.\n\n254\n00:12:12.295 --> 00:12:15.193\nAnd that's nice cuz you don't have\nto plug anything in and again,\n\n255\n00:12:15.193 --> 00:12:18.058\nyou're talking directly to the printer so\nthat saves some time.\n\n256\n00:12:18.058 --> 00:12:18.902\nAll right, now,\n\n257\n00:12:18.902 --> 00:12:22.741\nwhat I did here when I added Tim's printer\nwas kind of the automatic way, right?\n\n258\n00:12:22.741 --> 00:12:25.284\nIt found it on the network, it was easy,\n&gt;&gt; The right way [LAUGH].\n\n259\n00:12:25.284 --> 00:12:26.594\n&gt;&gt; The right way.\n\n260\n00:12:26.594 --> 00:12:29.324\nBut Bonjour has a limitation,\nso does AirPrint,\n\n261\n00:12:29.324 --> 00:12:32.080\nwhich is it operates\ninside of one IP subnet.\n\n262\n00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:34.910\nIn a complex network,\nyou may have more than one network.\n\n263\n00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:37.410\nAnd when you send out\nyour Bonjour discovery,\n\n264\n00:12:37.410 --> 00:12:39.160\nit's not gonna discover the entire world.\n\n265\n00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:41.303\nIt's limited to the network\nthat you're on.\n\n266\n00:12:41.303 --> 00:12:42.960\nYou might not find your printer.\n\n267\n00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:46.030\nAnd if it doesn't find your printer,\nyou're gonna have to manually add it in.\n\n268\n00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:48.300\nSo when I go back in here, so\nI'm back in my printer list.\n\n269\n00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:50.410\nI'm gonna hit that + sign again.\n\n270\n00:12:50.410 --> 00:12:53.870\nAnd this time I'm gonna\nignore what it finds, and\n\n271\n00:12:53.870 --> 00:12:57.190\nI'm gonna tell it about a printer\nthat is on the network.\n\n272\n00:12:57.190 --> 00:13:03.000\nWell, if you look up here, you'll ll see\nthese two buttons, IP and Windows, okay?\n\n273\n00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:08.442\nIf I choose IP, I can punch in the IP\naddress of a printer on the network and\n\n274\n00:13:08.442 --> 00:13:10.776\ntalk directly to the printer.\n\n275\n00:13:10.776 --> 00:13:13.860\nAnd the printer could be on\na different network than me.\n\n276\n00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:17.960\nSo maybe I wanna connect to that\nediting station printer, or\n\n277\n00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:21.350\nthe one on the host's row, that one over\nthere that I printed to this morning.\n\n278\n00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:24.790\nI can punch in its IP address,\nIf I can remember it, right,\n\n279\n00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:25.690\nthat's our real challenge.\n\n280\n00:13:25.690 --> 00:13:27.770\n&gt;&gt; Well, which is an interesting\nfact that you bring it up.\n\n281\n00:13:27.770 --> 00:13:29.520\nThese are things that we have to know,\n\n282\n00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:31.830\nwhereas Bonjour found those things out for\nus.\n\n283\n00:13:31.830 --> 00:13:33.780\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely,\nthat is the convenience of Bonjour, and\n\n284\n00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:35.860\nthat's why you normally\nwant to use it if you can.\n\n285\n00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:39.810\nIn this case, I need to know the IP or\nmaybe we've registered a DNS name for\n\n286\n00:13:39.810 --> 00:13:40.640\nit and we can punch that in.\n\n287\n00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:41.980\nBut I'm gonna punch it in.\n\n288\n00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:45.510\nNot only do I need to know the IP,\nI need to know how to talk to it.\n\n289\n00:13:45.510 --> 00:13:47.520\nNow, your Mac is gonna try and guess.\n\n290\n00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:50.310\nIt's gonna guess, and\nit usually does good enough, right?\n\n291\n00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:52.030\nBut you may need to come in and\nmanipulate that.\n\n292\n00:13:52.030 --> 00:13:54.992\nNotice the default here is\nInternet Printing Protocol or IPP.\n\n293\n00:13:54.992 --> 00:13:58.460\nIf you drop it down, you'll see LPD,\nthe Line Printer Daemon.\n\n294\n00:13:58.460 --> 00:14:02.380\nThat's the old way that Unix used to\nuse to communicate to the printers and\n\n295\n00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:04.180\nit's line printer, right?\n\n296\n00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:07.151\nRemember the old dot matrix\nprinters that would go,\n\n297\n00:14:07.151 --> 00:14:11.352\nhad the little ribbon and hammers that\nwould basically punch in the dots.\n\n298\n00:14:11.352 --> 00:14:14.866\nAnd so it would go [NOISE] one line and\nthen [NOISE] a second line?\n\n299\n00:14:14.866 --> 00:14:17.220\nThat's how old the line printer daemon is.\n\n300\n00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:18.520\nVery, very old technology.\n\n301\n00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:19.930\nStill works today though, right?\n\n302\n00:14:19.930 --> 00:14:22.540\nAnd so we can communicate to\na lot of printers that way.\n\n303\n00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:26.540\nBut you also have HP Jetdirect,\nand this is an HP printer, right?\n\n304\n00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:32.310\nIf it was a Lexmark, or Canon, or somebody\nelse, then we might see a different\n\n305\n00:14:32.310 --> 00:14:35.240\ntype of socket connection here,\ncuz it tries to figure that out for us.\n\n306\n00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:38.120\nIn my case, it is an HP, so\nI can go ahead and choose that, and\n\n307\n00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:40.830\nthen I can provide any other\ninformation that I need.\n\n308\n00:14:40.830 --> 00:14:43.340\nNow the name is defaulting\nto the IP address.\n\n309\n00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:45.680\nAnd I don't want that,\ncuz I'm not gonna remember it.\n\n310\n00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:48.534\nSo I'm going to call\nthis the Host's Printer.\n\n311\n00:14:48.534 --> 00:14:51.180\nAll right,\nthis is the one that we all print to.\n\n312\n00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:55.538\nThe location, this one is,\nwe'll say this one's in Room 1402.\n\n313\n00:14:55.538 --> 00:14:57.753\nWe don't actually have room\nnumbers here in the building,\n\n314\n00:14:57.753 --> 00:14:59.370\nthis is just me making it up.\n\n315\n00:14:59.370 --> 00:15:00.140\nAnd then lastly,\n\n316\n00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:03.900\nthere's this bit here where it says,\nuse Generic PostScript Printer.\n\n317\n00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:05.250\nWhat is that?\n\n318\n00:15:05.250 --> 00:15:06.580\nWell, when you drop it down,\n\n319\n00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:10.760\nyou'll see there's a few different choices\nabout how we talk to that printer.\n\n320\n00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:16.410\nIn the printer world, when we send\na print job to it, in the olden days,\n\n321\n00:15:16.410 --> 00:15:20.290\nyour computer would basically make\na picture of what it wanted to print.\n\n322\n00:15:20.290 --> 00:15:24.080\nAnd then your printer was just taking\nthat picture and printing it out,\n\n323\n00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:25.200\nwhich is really inefficient.\n\n324\n00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:29.120\nIt caused a large amount of data to be\nsent, it made print jobs take a long time.\n\n325\n00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:32.277\nAnd so what they found was,\nif we store the fonts for\n\n326\n00:15:32.277 --> 00:15:34.706\neverything that we're gonna render.\n\n327\n00:15:34.706 --> 00:15:37.489\nIf we store the fonts\non the printer itself,\n\n328\n00:15:37.489 --> 00:15:41.170\nthen all we have to do is\nsend the text to the printer.\n\n329\n00:15:41.170 --> 00:15:43.560\nAnd the printer can render it\nfrom there and print it out.\n\n330\n00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:45.060\nIt's much, much faster.\n\n331\n00:15:45.060 --> 00:15:47.670\nThat's why printers today are a lot\nfaster than they used to be.\n\n332\n00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:50.933\nWell, the challenge is how do\nwe communicate that, right?\n\n333\n00:15:50.933 --> 00:15:54.918\nAnd there's two main ways of doing that,\nPostScript and PCL, or\n\n334\n00:15:54.918 --> 00:15:56.880\nthe printer control language.\n\n335\n00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:59.698\nHP was a big push behind PCL.\n\n336\n00:15:59.698 --> 00:16:02.066\nAdobe was a big push behind PostScript.\n\n337\n00:16:02.066 --> 00:16:03.532\nBoth are generally supported.\n\n338\n00:16:03.532 --> 00:16:07.620\nIf you buy a printer today, the odds\nare they support both of these, all right?\n\n339\n00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:09.070\nWhich one do you pick?\n\n340\n00:16:09.070 --> 00:16:09.930\nKind of up to you.\n\n341\n00:16:09.930 --> 00:16:11.460\nMost people aren't gonna care, right?\n\n342\n00:16:11.460 --> 00:16:13.240\nAs long as I can print,\nthat's all I care about.\n\n343\n00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:14.790\nBut if you're a typesetter, right?\n\n344\n00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:19.303\nif you're a professional, if you create\nmarketing materials as your job,\n\n345\n00:16:19.303 --> 00:16:23.763\nyou may find that you get better results\nwith one language verses another.\n\n346\n00:16:23.763 --> 00:16:26.750\nAnd then there is this third option,\nSelect Software, what is that all about?\n\n347\n00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:29.510\nWell, some manufacturers\ngo even a step further and\n\n348\n00:16:29.510 --> 00:16:32.860\nwrite their own custom software for\ninteracting with the printer and\n\n349\n00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:36.390\nthe more advances and fancy the printer\nis, the more that this is true.\n\n350\n00:16:36.390 --> 00:16:39.240\nYou'll have to download that\nsoftware from the vendor and then,\n\n351\n00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:41.050\nyou are able to select\nthat software right here,\n\n352\n00:16:41.050 --> 00:16:43.460\nto pick which language to\nuse to talk to that printer.\n\n353\n00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:46.869\nOkay, so\nyou have that option available as well.\n\n354\n00:16:46.869 --> 00:16:50.019\nAll right, in my case though, I'm gona\nstick with PostScript because, again,\n\n355\n00:16:50.019 --> 00:16:51.860\nthat's gonna work fine for most of us.\n\n356\n00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:54.840\nAnd when I hit Add,\nIt's gonna talk to that printer.\n\n357\n00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:57.680\nSo here it is, it's talking to it, making\nsure that it actually sees it, that it\n\n358\n00:16:57.680 --> 00:17:01.890\nreally does exist, and then it's gonna\ntry to identify what driver it needs.\n\n359\n00:17:01.890 --> 00:17:04.020\nIt's talking to the printer.\n\n360\n00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:06.720\nAnd so when it does that,\nit'll say, you're in HPM506, or\n\n361\n00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:09.040\nwhatever it said a second ago.\n\n362\n00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:11.700\nAnd it'll say, all right, well let me\nsee if I have that driver registered.\n\n363\n00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:13.010\nAnd, I do.\n\n364\n00:17:13.010 --> 00:17:13.620\nOkay, good.\n\n365\n00:17:13.620 --> 00:17:16.460\nSo I've got that and\nlet me load it here into the system, and\n\n366\n00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:17.620\nnow you'll be able to print.\n\n367\n00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:19.481\nBut see how it's taking a lot longer?\n\n368\n00:17:19.481 --> 00:17:21.559\nJust kinda sitting here,\nactually getting kinda bored.\n\n369\n00:17:21.559 --> 00:17:23.625\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And\n\n370\n00:17:23.625 --> 00:17:26.450\nthat's one of the negatives here,\nof it having to figure out this.\n\n371\n00:17:26.450 --> 00:17:28.410\nIf it's talking to that printer,\nit's taking inventory,\n\n372\n00:17:28.410 --> 00:17:30.600\nit's pulling down a bunch of settings and\nfiguring it out.\n\n373\n00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:33.920\nBut when it's done, that printer will\nget added to my list over here, or\n\n374\n00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:35.250\nI'll get an error.\n\n375\n00:17:35.250 --> 00:17:37.715\nIf I get an error,\nthat will mean I need to go and\n\n376\n00:17:37.715 --> 00:17:40.607\ndownload a driver or I need to-\n&gt;&gt; Do some network troubleshooting\n\n377\n00:17:40.607 --> 00:17:41.137\nor whatever.\n\n378\n00:17:41.137 --> 00:17:44.860\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, or switch from PostScript to\nPCL or whatever it is that I need to do.\n\n379\n00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:46.585\nSo, that's all gonna happened.\n\n380\n00:17:46.585 --> 00:17:49.200\nNow, while waiting on that,\nlet me talk about the other option.\n\n381\n00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:54.300\nI'm talking to this printer VIP, there was\na third option up here that says, Windows.\n\n382\n00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:55.571\n&gt;&gt; You'll notice it's always grayed out.\n\n383\n00:17:55.571 --> 00:17:59.088\n[LAUGH] Well, it doesn't like\nto talk to Windows very much.\n\n384\n00:17:59.088 --> 00:18:02.941\n&gt;&gt; It's grayed out right now maybe\nbecause I have my configure menu open.\n\n385\n00:18:02.941 --> 00:18:06.910\nBut basically, when you browse\na Windows network, you can use SMB,\n\n386\n00:18:06.910 --> 00:18:08.494\nthe Server Message Block.\n\n387\n00:18:08.494 --> 00:18:12.772\nBack in our file sharing episode,\nwe talked about SMB a little bit, and\n\n388\n00:18:12.772 --> 00:18:17.359\nwith SMB, you can detect not just\nfolders and files, but printers as well.\n\n389\n00:18:17.359 --> 00:18:21.111\nAnd to these is telling you that you wanna\nbrowse the network using SMB to look for\n\n390\n00:18:21.111 --> 00:18:22.450\nprinters, okay?\n\n391\n00:18:22.450 --> 00:18:24.140\nThat's one way that you can connect.\n\n392\n00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:26.770\nI do wanna highlight something that might\nturn up on the exam or might not but\n\n393\n00:18:26.770 --> 00:18:29.290\nis either ways,\nit's good information for you to know.\n\n394\n00:18:29.290 --> 00:18:32.460\nMacs can print to SMB printers, right,\nthat's why I have that Windows option so\n\n395\n00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:35.360\nI can find a Windows machine\nthat sharing a printer.\n\n396\n00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:37.760\nAlways better to talk directly\nto the printer if you can, but\n\n397\n00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:39.790\nif you got to go through like\na Windows print server, you can.\n\n398\n00:18:40.810 --> 00:18:44.000\nMacs can also share\nprinters on the network.\n\n399\n00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.970\nAnd when it shares the printer,\nit sharing it using AFP,\n\n400\n00:18:47.970 --> 00:18:50.620\nthe Apple File Protocol and Bonjour.\n\n401\n00:18:50.620 --> 00:18:53.170\nIt's not sharing with SMB\nat least not by default.\n\n402\n00:18:53.170 --> 00:18:57.550\nSo by default, Windows machine\nwon't see Mac printers, but\n\n403\n00:18:57.550 --> 00:18:59.650\nMacs can see Windows printer.\n\n404\n00:18:59.650 --> 00:19:02.630\nSo, remember that,\nthere are ways to make it work.\n\n405\n00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:04.440\nActually, you know while I'm\nwaiting on this, let's see,\n\n406\n00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:08.060\nwell let me go, okay, while we are waiting\non that, I'm just gonna ignore that\n\n407\n00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:10.850\nwindow on the background and\nit's taking way longer than it should.\n\n408\n00:19:10.850 --> 00:19:13.558\nI might have put the wrong IP in,\n[LAUGH], yeah.\n\n409\n00:19:13.558 --> 00:19:17.635\nSo, anyhow, while we're waiting on that,\nif I go in my Sharing system preference,\n\n410\n00:19:17.635 --> 00:19:21.736\nhere is where you got your sharing and see\nhow you've got Printer Sharing right here.\n\n411\n00:19:21.736 --> 00:19:25.248\nAnd when you choose Printer Sharing,\nit tells us, hey, you won't allows\n\n412\n00:19:25.248 --> 00:19:29.000\nother people in the network to connect,\nand so I can choose that and I can share.\n\n413\n00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.460\nSo, like Tim's Printer, for example.\n\n414\n00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:35.030\nI'm talking directly to Tim's Printer,\nright?\n\n415\n00:19:35.030 --> 00:19:37.980\nAnd now, I can share that out and\n\n416\n00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:41.690\nother people can find it through me,\nand we can set permissions.\n\n417\n00:19:41.690 --> 00:19:47.448\nI can say, everyone can print or\njust me, maybe just Don Pezet can print.\n\n418\n00:19:47.448 --> 00:19:50.610\nI can kind of tailor this however I want.\n\n419\n00:19:50.610 --> 00:19:54.970\nSo, if we say, Don Pezet, I'm the owner,\nso I don't have a little permissions box.\n\n420\n00:19:54.970 --> 00:19:58.070\nI can't manipulate it, but\nthen we can take everybody else and\n\n421\n00:19:58.070 --> 00:20:01.810\nwe can say they have no access or\nthey can print or whatever.\n\n422\n00:20:01.810 --> 00:20:05.670\nSo here now, I can print to it and\nnobody else can, right?\n\n423\n00:20:05.670 --> 00:20:06.510\nSo we can so that,\n\n424\n00:20:06.510 --> 00:20:10.980\nwe can setup a sharing right from here,\nassuming we've got our printers in place.\n\n425\n00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:13.120\nNow, printers sharing is off right now.\n\n426\n00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:17.600\nAnd I checked it, and it went on, and\nthen it went off again, which more than\n\n427\n00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:20.870\nlikely is indicating that it's unhappy\nabout what's going on back here.\n\n428\n00:20:20.870 --> 00:20:24.930\nCuz I'm kinda doing two settings at the\nsame time, or it indicates that I clicked\n\n429\n00:20:24.930 --> 00:20:28.531\ntwice, apparently, is what I did cuz\nit just turned fine right there.\n\n430\n00:20:28.531 --> 00:20:30.355\nBut now I'm sharing this printer out.\n\n431\n00:20:30.355 --> 00:20:34.065\nBut do remember that I'm sharing it out\nwith Bonjour and Apple File Protocol.\n\n432\n00:20:34.065 --> 00:20:36.165\nAnd Windows machines don't look for\nthat by default.\n\n433\n00:20:36.165 --> 00:20:37.115\nSo, other Macs,\n\n434\n00:20:37.115 --> 00:20:41.225\nlike Daniel's Macbook, it'll probably\nsee me sharing this Tim printer, right?\n\n435\n00:20:41.225 --> 00:20:43.285\nBut, if I were to go to a Windows\nmachine here in the building,\n\n436\n00:20:43.285 --> 00:20:45.075\nit probably won't see me sharing that,\n\n437\n00:20:45.075 --> 00:20:47.580\nunless we've configured third-party\nsoftware or other things.\n\n438\n00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:49.660\nThat's one limitation that we have.\n\n439\n00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:53.510\nBut, we can connect to those\nWindows printers without an issue.\n\n440\n00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:54.961\nAll right, let's go back and\nlook at the other printer,\n\n441\n00:20:54.961 --> 00:20:56.150\nthat's kind of sitting\nhere taking forever.\n\n442\n00:20:56.150 --> 00:20:58.526\nAnd actually,\nI have a theory why it's taking so long.\n\n443\n00:20:58.526 --> 00:21:02.321\nYou'll remember I mentioned earlier in\nthe episode that, one of the negatives of\n\n444\n00:21:02.321 --> 00:21:05.621\nadding a printer via like air print\nis that, it doesn't have a great way\n\n445\n00:21:05.621 --> 00:21:08.890\nto sense a lot of the features\nthat are on that printer remotely.\n\n446\n00:21:08.890 --> 00:21:11.675\nWell the same thing can happen\nwhen I add in a printer by IP and\n\n447\n00:21:11.675 --> 00:21:15.402\nI bet what's going on here sl let's\njump back here and take a look at it.\n\n448\n00:21:15.402 --> 00:21:19.430\nSays, that is setting up my host printer\nand it's setting up the device, right?\n\n449\n00:21:19.430 --> 00:21:23.440\nAnd it's just kinda sitting here,\nI'm gonna hit Configure and\n\n450\n00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:26.420\nit's trying to detect the hardware\nthat's on that printer and\n\n451\n00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:28.270\nit's more than like failing to detect it,\nright?\n\n452\n00:21:28.270 --> 00:21:29.759\nSo it's just not figuring\nout what's on there.\n\n453\n00:21:29.759 --> 00:21:32.600\nSo, it's trying to remove\nthis duplexing unit.\n\n454\n00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:36.130\nA duplexing unit is what allows to print\non two sides on a piece of paper, right?\n\n455\n00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:39.650\nPrinter is, no matter how fancy they are,\n\n456\n00:21:39.650 --> 00:21:43.180\nprinters only print on one\nside of a piece of paper.\n\n457\n00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:46.330\nBut, some of them have a duplex where\nthe piece of paper goes through,\n\n458\n00:21:46.330 --> 00:21:50.820\nhits a roller, and flips over and comes\nback and so it prints on the other side.\n\n459\n00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:53.220\nSo it's actually flipping\nthe piece of paper to print on it.\n\n460\n00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:56.130\nThe printer itself is only\nprinting on one side,\n\n461\n00:21:56.130 --> 00:21:57.900\nit's the piece of paper that is flipping.\n\n462\n00:21:57.900 --> 00:22:01.570\nSo you obviously need a piece\nof hardware to do that, and so\n\n463\n00:22:01.570 --> 00:22:02.700\nit's asking whether I've got that.\n\n464\n00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:06.375\nNow I bet if I tell it yes or no, I could\nprobably leave that empty but I'll say,\n\n465\n00:22:06.375 --> 00:22:09.071\npretty sure our printer has a duplex unit,\ndoesn't it?\n\n466\n00:22:09.071 --> 00:22:10.398\n&gt;&gt; I don't know.\n\n467\n00:22:10.398 --> 00:22:12.993\n&gt;&gt; And see here is the problem, I could be\nwrong, I could say, yeah, we're going to\n\n468\n00:22:12.993 --> 00:22:15.571\nduplexing unit and then it could be wrong,\nwe could always fix that afterwards.\n\n469\n00:22:15.571 --> 00:22:16.880\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and just say, OK.\n\n470\n00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:18.620\n&gt;&gt; And I'll bet, yeah, there we go.\n\n471\n00:22:18.620 --> 00:22:20.870\nAnd once we clear that up,\nthen it gets added and\n\n472\n00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:22.900\nsure enough there it is, Host's Printer.\n\n473\n00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:23.620\nWe got it right there.\n\n474\n00:22:23.620 --> 00:22:26.130\nIt's idle, it hasn't been used at all.\n\n475\n00:22:26.130 --> 00:22:29.660\nBut it says, it was the last one I used,\ncuz I just added it.\n\n476\n00:22:29.660 --> 00:22:34.890\nBut now, it's got it, and, the printer\nicon here is a little more generic, right,\n\n477\n00:22:34.890 --> 00:22:36.950\nbecause I punched this in via IP.\n\n478\n00:22:36.950 --> 00:22:39.340\nBecause I'm using a generic\nPostScript printer,\n\n479\n00:22:39.340 --> 00:22:43.550\nit didn't identify what that printer was,\nright?\n\n480\n00:22:43.550 --> 00:22:47.970\nSo, that's why I kind of had that\nproblem of, what hardware does it have?\n\n481\n00:22:47.970 --> 00:22:48.931\nWhat does it support?\n\n482\n00:22:48.931 --> 00:22:51.645\nAnd you've got this button here,\nOptions &amp; Supplies.\n\n483\n00:22:51.645 --> 00:22:55.197\nAnd if I get into that,\nhere's where I can see the Options and\n\n484\n00:22:55.197 --> 00:22:58.203\nif I was wrong in that duplexing unit,\nI can fix it.\n\n485\n00:22:58.203 --> 00:23:00.740\nI can uncheck that,\nI can put it back, all right?\n\n486\n00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:05.890\nNow, if I go back to add, and\nI'm gonna add that same printer,\n\n487\n00:23:05.890 --> 00:23:07.910\nbut this time I'm gonna do it via Bonjour,\nright?\n\n488\n00:23:07.910 --> 00:23:10.560\nSo here's that Office BW, whatever, right?\n\n489\n00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:13.960\nSo this is that same printer that\nI just called the host's printer.\n\n490\n00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:18.350\nIn fact, here, let me just call it\nthe host's Printer 2, the revenge.\n\n491\n00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:23.310\nAnd, you'll see the protocol,\nit's defaulting to Secure AirPrint, right?\n\n492\n00:23:23.310 --> 00:23:26.547\nIt's saying, we're gonna do an encrypted\nAirPrint communication to that printer,\n\n493\n00:23:26.547 --> 00:23:27.402\nwhich is really good.\n\n494\n00:23:27.402 --> 00:23:31.417\nOr, we could drop that down and\nwe could pick PostScript or PCL, right?\n\n495\n00:23:31.417 --> 00:23:35.120\nWhatever languages that we wanna talk to\nit, and I'll leave it as Secure AirPrint.\n\n496\n00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:36.500\nAnd I'll go ahead and hit Add.\n\n497\n00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:39.350\nNow when I do it this way,\nit's connecting, and\n\n498\n00:23:39.350 --> 00:23:42.770\nsee how I didn't get you stack\non that configured devices?\n\n499\n00:23:42.770 --> 00:23:46.253\nAnd that's because, with AirPrint,\nor not with AirPrint, sorry,\n\n500\n00:23:46.253 --> 00:23:50.240\nbut with Bonjour, we're able to see\nthe information about that printer.\n\n501\n00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:53.450\nAnd here is Host's Printer 2, and\nsee how the icon is customized.\n\n502\n00:23:53.450 --> 00:23:55.691\nThat's what that printer\nactually looks like.\n\n503\n00:23:55.691 --> 00:23:56.474\nIt found it.\n\n504\n00:23:56.474 --> 00:24:01.312\nAnd if I go into Options &amp; Supplies,\nI don't see the options tab.\n\n505\n00:24:01.312 --> 00:24:02.396\nAnd the reason I don't,\n\n506\n00:24:02.396 --> 00:24:04.930\nis because it already knows\nthe options that printer has.\n\n507\n00:24:04.930 --> 00:24:08.020\nI don't need to tweak it,\nit can detect and auto-sense them.\n\n508\n00:24:08.020 --> 00:24:11.798\nSo that's the difference we have\nbetween these different protocols.\n\n509\n00:24:11.798 --> 00:24:14.820\nAnd obviously, Bonjour is the one\nwe want to use if we can.\n\n510\n00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:16.540\nBut the other protocols are available.\n\n511\n00:24:16.540 --> 00:24:19.710\nAnd the only one I didn't show was\nthe Windows one, because we were waiting.\n\n512\n00:24:19.710 --> 00:24:22.090\nAnd so\nif I go back here to the Windows tab,\n\n513\n00:24:22.090 --> 00:24:25.880\nit's gonna use SMB to start\nscanning the network.\n\n514\n00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:30.700\nAnd so what I'm seeing here is a list of\nworkgroup names in the Windows world.\n\n515\n00:24:30.700 --> 00:24:34.920\nWhen you fire up a Windows machine,\nthe default workgroup name is workgroup.\n\n516\n00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:38.210\nAnd so here we go,\nI've got a bunch of devices showing up.\n\n517\n00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:40.030\nA lot of these are Macs, right?\n\n518\n00:24:40.030 --> 00:24:44.720\nMacs that are running file sharing with\nwindows support, they show up with SMB.\n\n519\n00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:47.208\nBut when I come in here and\nfind a printer, well,\n\n520\n00:24:47.208 --> 00:24:49.776\nactually I don't know that\nwe have any printers.\n\n521\n00:24:49.776 --> 00:24:50.794\n&gt;&gt; I don't know that we do.\n\n522\n00:24:50.794 --> 00:24:54.560\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH] that would be the real\nchallenge is finding one that does.\n\n523\n00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:57.738\nBut, I don't know,\nI guess maybe the editing station.\n\n524\n00:24:57.738 --> 00:25:01.220\n[SOUND] It asking me to authenticate.\n\n525\n00:25:01.220 --> 00:25:03.450\nSo if I have a user account or\n\n526\n00:25:03.450 --> 00:25:05.820\nI can try and go anonymous,\nI don't have a user account.\n\n527\n00:25:05.820 --> 00:25:08.330\nSo we'll try anonymous and\ndenied, all right.\n\n528\n00:25:08.330 --> 00:25:11.020\nWell, you'd basically browse and\nyou'd find them right here and\n\n529\n00:25:11.020 --> 00:25:12.620\nyou can add them in.\n\n530\n00:25:12.620 --> 00:25:15.940\nYou'll have a lot of the same problems\nthat we have with other technologies that\n\n531\n00:25:15.940 --> 00:25:17.980\nit can be hard to sense the settings.\n\n532\n00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:20.190\nBut here, you're not really\nsensing the printer itself,\n\n533\n00:25:20.190 --> 00:25:23.170\nyou're sensing a shared version\nof the printer from that machine.\n\n534\n00:25:23.170 --> 00:25:27.060\nSo you normally do get all your options\nstuff comes across pretty well.\n\n535\n00:25:27.060 --> 00:25:31.160\nBut, if it's a multifunction printer,\nsomething like a scanner kind of combo,\n\n536\n00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:34.260\nyou see that with office printers a lot,\nusually the extra stuff doesn't work,\n\n537\n00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:37.460\njust the printing function, the scanning\nand fax won't work over the network.\n\n538\n00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:39.810\nSo, stuff to keep in\nmind as you add these in.\n\n539\n00:25:39.810 --> 00:25:41.265\nA lot of different methods here for\n\n540\n00:25:41.265 --> 00:25:45.020\ngetting those printers added to our\nsystem and getting that support baked in.\n\n541\n00:25:45.020 --> 00:25:49.350\n&gt;&gt; Now Don, speaking of options on\nthe printer's features that might be\n\n542\n00:25:49.350 --> 00:25:50.620\nthere for us.\n\n543\n00:25:50.620 --> 00:25:55.140\nHow do we go inside of a Mac OS and say,\nhey, I've added some functionality,\n\n544\n00:25:55.140 --> 00:26:00.190\nmaybe I bought a new tray that plugs in or\nI don't see this option and\n\n545\n00:26:00.190 --> 00:26:01.060\nI need to configure that.\n\n546\n00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:02.080\nHow would I do that?\n\n547\n00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:05.880\n&gt;&gt; All right, well, if you picked\nit with Bonjuor, you don't have to.\n\n548\n00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:08.880\nIt will sense that cuz it's talking to\nthe printer every time you boot up,\n\n549\n00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:11.630\nevery time you go to print, it's actually\nsending a little ping to talk to those\n\n550\n00:26:11.630 --> 00:26:12.800\nprinters, and it'll sense it.\n\n551\n00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:16.560\nSo the only time we had to manipulate\nthat is if we added it by IP.\n\n552\n00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:19.660\nSo you do what I did a moment ago and\nhere let me just come back in here and\n\n553\n00:26:19.660 --> 00:26:20.520\nI'll show you.\n\n554\n00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:22.480\nSo I take the one that I added by IP.\n\n555\n00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:25.830\nThis one I'm talking to periodically also,\nbut if I didn't detect the options in\n\n556\n00:26:25.830 --> 00:26:27.625\nthe beginning,\nI'm not gonna detect it now either.\n\n557\n00:26:27.625 --> 00:26:29.200\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So if we go on modify,\n\n558\n00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:30.330\nyou would go into options and\n\n559\n00:26:30.330 --> 00:26:35.110\nsupplies and you'd have that options\ntab right there to be able to set it.\n\n560\n00:26:35.110 --> 00:26:37.660\nAnd this particular printer only has so\nmany options.\n\n561\n00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:41.040\nSo I've got duplexing and that's it,\nbut you'll see other things like\n\n562\n00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:44.040\nmultiple trays, some printers will\nhave five or six different trays.\n\n563\n00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:47.130\nAnd a, what's it called like\na bypass feed, or what is that?\n\n564\n00:26:47.130 --> 00:26:48.660\nA manual feed?\n\n565\n00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:49.590\nManual tray?\n\n566\n00:26:49.590 --> 00:26:50.410\nSomething.\n&gt;&gt; Something.\n\n567\n00:26:50.410 --> 00:26:52.190\n&gt;&gt; Where you can manually add in stuff.\n\n568\n00:26:52.190 --> 00:26:55.710\nSome of them have hole punchers,\nstaplers, folders.\n\n569\n00:26:55.710 --> 00:26:58.680\nThey actually have a name for that,\nwhere it can print basically booklets and\n\n570\n00:26:58.680 --> 00:26:59.580\nfold them.\n\n571\n00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:03.810\nPrinters get pretty fancy, and\nyou'll see all those options under here,\n\n572\n00:27:03.810 --> 00:27:06.370\nyou can check them off,\nif you actually have that.\n\n573\n00:27:06.370 --> 00:27:08.110\n&gt;&gt; All right, well, there we go.\n\n574\n00:27:08.110 --> 00:27:11.960\nWhen it comes to printers inside\nof your Mac operating system,\n\n575\n00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:13.630\nactually it's not too difficult\nto be honest with you.\n\n576\n00:27:13.630 --> 00:27:14.770\nIt's quite painless.\n\n577\n00:27:14.770 --> 00:27:17.580\nBonjour is basically doing most\nof the heavy lifting for you.\n\n578\n00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:20.170\nUnless you get into the IP world,\nwhich does happen.\n\n579\n00:27:20.170 --> 00:27:22.910\nSo you've got to be prepared for that, you\nhave to have a little bit of knowledge.\n\n580\n00:27:22.910 --> 00:27:26.700\nBut Don, you did a fantastic job of\nshowing us each one of the options that we\n\n581\n00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:29.460\nhave available for us,\nhow we can work with them.\n\n582\n00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:30.650\nVery simple.\n\n583\n00:27:30.650 --> 00:27:33.700\nI like the way that Apple has\nset up their printing services.\n\n584\n00:27:33.700 --> 00:27:36.995\nThey want you to be able to print because\nthey know that the heads will roll.\n\n585\n00:27:36.995 --> 00:27:39.700\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; if you cannot print out the lyrics to\n\n586\n00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:41.690\nyour favorite Metallica song,\nor whatever the case is.\n\n587\n00:27:41.690 --> 00:27:42.200\n&gt;&gt; It happens.\n\n588\n00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:45.940\n&gt;&gt; It does happen, I've not seen\nan angry person, until they're like,\n\n589\n00:27:45.940 --> 00:27:47.962\nthis is not printing my\nMetallica lyrics [LAUGH].\n\n590\n00:27:47.962 --> 00:27:49.400\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That being said,\n\n591\n00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:53.200\nit does look like it is time for us to\ncall it a day, at least for this episode.\n\n592\n00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:56.060\nWe do thank you good folks for\nwatching, but signing off for\n\n593\n00:27:56.060 --> 00:27:58.330\nITProTV,

watching ITPRO.TV\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n4\n00:00:12.859 --> 00:00:16.797\ngreetings everyone and welcome to\nanother great episode of ITPRO.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:16.797 --> 00:00:20.020\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\nin today's episode where\n\n6\n00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:24.249\ncoming back at you with more of our\nMac Integration Basics, Sierra update.\n\n7\n00:00:24.249 --> 00:00:27.725\nAnd joining us in the studio to lend\nhis expertise on the very topic is\n\n8\n00:00:27.725 --> 00:00:29.377\nour good friend Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n9\n00:00:29.377 --> 00:00:32.060\nDon, we're so glad to have you again,\nhow is it going on?\n\n10\n00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:36.530\n&gt;&gt; Things are going great Daniel,\nI feel like we've done this before,\n\n11\n00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.400\nalmost like we're in a time machine.\n\n12\n00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:40.490\n&gt;&gt; Called dark brown right?\n\n13\n00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:42.005\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Pretty good segway right there\n\n14\n00:00:42.005 --> 00:00:42.628\n[CROSSTALK].\n\n15\n00:00:42.628 --> 00:00:44.010\nAll right, so they're pretty bad.\n\n16\n00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.590\nIn this episode we're gonna talk about\nTime Machine which is the backup software\n\n17\n00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:53.315\npackage with every OS 10 system\nreleased in the last, I don't know,\n\n18\n00:00:53.315 --> 00:00:54.240\n8 years or something.\n\n19\n00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:55.760\nIt's been quite a while and\n\n20\n00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.240\nit's one of those technologies that\nreally hasn't changed all that much.\n\n21\n00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:01.900\nSo if you used it in previous versions of\nMac OS, it's pretty much the same here.\n\n22\n00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.470\nBut don't let me downplay it,\n\n23\n00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:07.240\nbecause Time Machine is one of\nthe single greatest features in Mac OS.\n\n24\n00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.210\nThat if you've used any\nother operating system,\n\n25\n00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.390\nif you used any Linux distribution\ndoesn't matter which one.\n\n26\n00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.120\nAnd if you've used pretty\nmuch any version of Windows,\n\n27\n00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:20.050\nnone of them have an easy reliable\nsolution for backing up your files.\n\n28\n00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:21.880\nThat makes it easy to recover your files.\n\n29\n00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.910\nI mean the time machine system\nthe Apple has created is honestly,\n\n30\n00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:29.900\nit is the best solution for\nbacking up a workstation or a laptop or\n\n31\n00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.360\na personal machine that's out there,\nright?\n\n32\n00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.990\nAt the enterprise level there's other\nsoftware that might be able to automate\n\n33\n00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.870\nthings and centrally manage it and\nbecomes valuable, but for small and\n\n34\n00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:42.590\nmedium businesses, for home users,\nTime Machine is simply amazing.\n\n35\n00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.010\nSo that's what we're going to be talking\nabout right here in this episode.\n\n36\n00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:46.739\n&gt;&gt; And Don, it is really cool.\n\n37\n00:01:46.739 --> 00:01:49.552\nWhen you see this thing absolutely, you've\nnever seen Time Machine work before.\n\n38\n00:01:49.552 --> 00:01:52.260\nYou're gonna be like, wow, that's no bad.\n\n39\n00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.190\nThat interface is actually kinda neat.\n\n40\n00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:57.070\nAnd it just makes it super easy for\nus to create backups.\n\n41\n00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:02.120\nSo that just brings us to\nour first foray into this.\n\n42\n00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.720\nWhere do we begin?\n\n43\n00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:03.310\nWhat do we start?\n\n44\n00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:04.330\nHow do we set it up?\n\n45\n00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:05.140\nHow do we start working with it?\n\n46\n00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:06.610\n&gt;&gt; All right, so I've hyped it up a bit.\n\n47\n00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:08.130\nAnd let's just assume for\na moment that you,\n\n48\n00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:10.200\nthe viewer,\ngave never heard of Time Machine.\n\n49\n00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.420\nYou don't know what the heck\nI'm talking about and\n\n50\n00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.230\nyou think I'm crazy cuz we've been\nrambling on for three minutes now.\n\n51\n00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.520\nSo, what the heck is Time Machine?\n\n52\n00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.430\nIt's a backup solution, it takes the files\nthat you have on your system and\n\n53\n00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.360\nbacks them up to some other location.\n\n54\n00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.850\nAnd that other location is normally going\nto be removable storage attached to\n\n55\n00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.890\nyour computer, like a USB hard drive.\n\n56\n00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.060\nBut it can be a network location also.\n\n57\n00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.390\nApple sells what are called Time Capsules.\n\n58\n00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.760\nThese little routers that have\nhard drives built into them.\n\n59\n00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.300\nYou can stick it right n your network and\n\n60\n00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.670\nyour computer will find it over\nthe network and back up to it.\n\n61\n00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.100\nOr you can have a server,\n\n62\n00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:45.090\nany system running OS 10 server\ncan be a Time Machine server.\n\n63\n00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.950\nAnd now you're backed up gets stored\nright on that server instead of\n\n64\n00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:49.200\nsomewhere movable media.\n\n65\n00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.560\nSo got a couple options\nwhere you back up to.\n\n66\n00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.600\nBut it's designed to be simple.\n\n67\n00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.730\nThe idea is that you get\nsomething like a USB hard drive,\n\n68\n00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:02.000\njust a removal media device and\nyou plug it in your computer and\n\n69\n00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.865\nthen it backs up, and\nthen you just forget about it.\n\n70\n00:03:05.865 --> 00:03:08.445\nAnd every time you walk up to your\ncomputer and plug in you're good to go.\n\n71\n00:03:08.445 --> 00:03:09.615\nSo for example,\n\n72\n00:03:09.615 --> 00:03:14.505\nthis is the hard drive, this is the actual\nhard drive that I use is my Time Machine.\n\n73\n00:03:14.505 --> 00:03:18.805\nSo my laptop that I'm using here\nin the show which I've had for\n\n74\n00:03:18.805 --> 00:03:20.285\na couple a years now.\n\n75\n00:03:20.285 --> 00:03:22.655\nBacks up to this drive and\nit's been backed up to this drive for\n\n76\n00:03:22.655 --> 00:03:23.385\na couple of years now.\n\n77\n00:03:23.385 --> 00:03:25.420\nSo I've got a quite a bit of data on this.\n\n78\n00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:30.120\nAnd if I ever lose my laptop or\naccidentally delete a file or\n\n79\n00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.290\nsomething like that.\n\n80\n00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.010\nI know that right here in this hand\ndrive I can go and get that data and\n\n81\n00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:36.400\nbe able to recover it.\n\n82\n00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.890\nAnd the best part is all I have to do is\nis remember to plug this in every now and\n\n83\n00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:41.910\nthen, right?\n\n84\n00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:43.680\nAnd I normally have it at my desk.\n\n85\n00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.740\nAt my desk I have a little USB hub and\nthis stays plugged into my USB hub.\n\n86\n00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:50.360\nAnd so whenever I go back\nto my desk in my office,\n\n87\n00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.850\nI plug my USB hub into my laptop that's\nhow I get my keyboard and mouse and\n\n88\n00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:58.270\nother things, and this is automatically\nplugged in at the same time.\n\n89\n00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:03.320\nAnd Time Machine runs once an hour,\nonce an hour it backs up your laptop or\n\n90\n00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:06.730\ndesktop, right, this could be\na desktop machine or whatever.\n\n91\n00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:10.770\nAnd so, let me just plug this back in\nhere while I'm talking about it, there.\n\n92\n00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:13.250\nSo, it runs once an hour.\n\n93\n00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:15.090\nThe first time you set up Time Machine,\n\n94\n00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:19.000\nit backs up your entire computer,\neverything that's on your computer.\n\n95\n00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.690\nAnd then once an hour it looks for\nwhat changed, everything that changed.\n\n96\n00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:26.400\nAnd then it just backs up what changed.\n\n97\n00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.080\nSo the first back up might take a long\ntime, it might take 30 minutes,\n\n98\n00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.460\nit might take an hour to\ndo that first backup.\n\n99\n00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:33.590\nBut after that every other\nbackup runs really fast.\n\n100\n00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:35.760\nAnd it backs up every hour.\n\n101\n00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:38.640\nSo if I'm working on a document\nthroughout the day, and\n\n102\n00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:41.970\nmaybe I deleted a paragraph out\nof a document at 10 o'clock.\n\n103\n00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:43.869\nAnd now it's 3 o'clock, and\n\n104\n00:04:43.869 --> 00:04:47.270\nI'm like, I really wish I had\nthat paragraph back again.\n\n105\n00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:51.450\nI could go and pull the document\nback up how it looked at 10 AM.\n\n106\n00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:54.930\nAnd I can see that document and\nI can get that paragraph back, right?\n\n107\n00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:58.680\nOr I could recover the entire file or\nthe entire laptop.\n\n108\n00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:01.430\nMaybe I'd drop my laptop\nin a bucket of water.\n\n109\n00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:02.593\nHappens all the time right.\n\n110\n00:05:02.593 --> 00:05:06.410\n[LAUGH] If it ends up on a bucket of\nwater, I'd go and but a new laptop right?\n\n111\n00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:07.710\nOr maybe I should just upgrade.\n\n112\n00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:10.080\nI'd but a new laptop anyway, right?\n\n113\n00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.670\nWhen you first fire up a new Mac.\n\n114\n00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:13.870\nWhat does it ask you to do?\n\n115\n00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:15.380\nIt asked you an import your data.\n\n116\n00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:19.150\nYou can import it from iCloud or\na Time Machine backup.\n\n117\n00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:21.600\nAnd I can hook up my time\nmachine hard drive and\n\n118\n00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:24.530\nit'll restore all my\ndata to this new laptop.\n\n119\n00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:28.150\nI got an entirely new laptop completely\nconfigured exactly the way that\n\n120\n00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:31.270\nI had with all of my data.\n\n121\n00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:32.500\nThat easy, right?\n\n122\n00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:37.970\nTime machine is all about having reliable\nbackups and making them easy to use.\n\n123\n00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:39.920\nAll right, so how do we get it to set up?\n\n124\n00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:41.350\nIt's actually really not that hard.\n\n125\n00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:45.141\nStep one, you get something to backup\nonto like this one little drive.\n\n126\n00:05:45.141 --> 00:05:50.200\nYou can buy 1 terabyte hard drive these\ndays for $80, really, really inexpensive.\n\n127\n00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:51.751\nYou can buy two or three of these things,\n\n128\n00:05:51.751 --> 00:05:54.550\nyou can kind of cycle them out that\nway you can store one offsite, right?\n\n129\n00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:57.680\nBecause if this building burns down and\nmy laptop and\n\n130\n00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:01.290\nmy Time Machine hard driver right here,\nit's not gonna help me much, is it?\n\n131\n00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:02.360\nThey both burned up.\n\n132\n00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:06.860\nSo having it stored in iCloud that can\nhelp, but having an offsite backup\n\n133\n00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:09.780\nvia some kind of removable media\nis another great way to handle it.\n\n134\n00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:15.782\nAfter that I plug my removable media\nin and the first time a Mac sees a new\n\n135\n00:06:15.782 --> 00:06:19.840\nstorage, it ask if you wanna use for\nTime Machine, right?\n\n136\n00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:23.180\nSo for example here on my lab machine,\nright?\n\n137\n00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:25.950\nI have an extra hard drive in here.\n\n138\n00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:30.050\nAnd so if I go to my disk utility, you'll\nsee this extra hard drive that I have.\n\n139\n00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:30.990\nIt's unformatted.\n\n140\n00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:32.770\nIt has no partitions on it.\n\n141\n00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:36.830\nSo, I'm gonna erase it real quick and I'm\ngonna call it my Time Machine drive, but\n\n142\n00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:38.400\nyou can call it whatever you want.\n\n143\n00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:39.310\nI'm just calling it Time Machine so\n\n144\n00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:41.130\nI'm gonna remember what\nI was gonna use it for.\n\n145\n00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:44.860\nAnd I'm gonna format it as\nMac OS extended journal.\n\n146\n00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:49.890\nThe removable media does need to\nbe in Mac OS extended journal.\n\n147\n00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:54.420\nSo like when I bought this USB drive that\nI have here beside me it, originally\n\n148\n00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:58.890\nshipped with FAT32 as the file system, cuz\nthey wanted it to work on Windows and Mac.\n\n149\n00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:01.990\nSo when I plugged it in it asked if I\nwanted to use it for Time Machine and\n\n150\n00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:06.460\nwhen I said yes It then formatted it\nto make it Mac OS Extended Journaled.\n\n151\n00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:08.140\nSo I'm formatting this one ahead of time.\n\n152\n00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:11.690\nSo I'm just gonna format it,\nand I'll erase the drive.\n\n153\n00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:13.920\nAnd so it's gonna do that,\nit's gonna format it.\n\n154\n00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:16.960\nAnd now I've got this new drive.\n\n155\n00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:20.830\nAnd I can see it right up here,\nso it found this new drive.\n\n156\n00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:23.224\nI just called it Time Machine, that's\njust a name, I could have called it Bob.\n\n157\n00:07:23.224 --> 00:07:29.390\nAnd the moment it sees that new drive,\nit makes this pop up appear, okay?\n\n158\n00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:31.990\nIt says do you wanna use Time Machine,\n\n159\n00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:35.920\nin this case 1.1 terabyte to\nbackup with Time Machine.\n\n160\n00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:37.370\nTime Machines the name of the drive, so\n\n161\n00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:40.990\nif I call it Bob it will say you want\nto use Bob to backup Time Machine.\n\n162\n00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:43.690\nSo it's just asking about when\nyou use this as a location.\n\n163\n00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:47.760\nAnd I can choose, I can say I'll decide\nlater or I can say no this is something\n\n164\n00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:51.590\namusing for another purpose or\nyes I wanna backup to this disk, right?\n\n165\n00:07:51.590 --> 00:07:55.852\nNow, if I choose to back up to it,\nwe can configure Time Machine and\n\n166\n00:07:55.852 --> 00:07:58.300\nit will start with an initial back up.\n\n167\n00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:00.859\nIt's gonna back up my entire computer.\n\n168\n00:08:00.859 --> 00:08:06.450\nRight, or I can choose to encrypt.\n\n169\n00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:10.370\nNow when I encrypt, now it's gonna make\nsure the data on the drive is encrypted.\n\n170\n00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:11.820\nNow, why would I care about that?\n\n171\n00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:15.400\nIn a previous episode, we talked about\nFileVault and whole disk encryption.\n\n172\n00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:18.270\nAnd if somebody rips the hard\ndrive out of my computer,\n\n173\n00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:20.600\nthey can plug it into another computer and\nread the data.\n\n174\n00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:22.860\nUnless, I used FileVault to encrypt it.\n\n175\n00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:25.870\nWell, here,\nI'm talking about the USB drive, right?\n\n176\n00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:28.030\nThat's way easier to steal.\n\n177\n00:08:28.030 --> 00:08:30.560\nSomebody can walk into my\noffice while I wasn't there and\n\n178\n00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:33.660\njust snag the USB drive right\noff my USB hub and walk out.\n\n179\n00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:34.920\nI might not even notice, right?\n\n180\n00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:38.550\nCuz I don't mess with the drive very\noften, just when I'm missing something.\n\n181\n00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:42.420\nAnd so, I might not even notice until the\nwarning bubbles from Time Machine pop-up\n\n182\n00:08:42.420 --> 00:08:45.180\nwhich I believe by\ndefault is like 14 days.\n\n183\n00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:47.930\nWe're start saying hey,\nwe haven't backup in 14 days.\n\n184\n00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:51.625\nAnd I would look at it and say,\nmy drive is missing for two weeks.\n\n185\n00:08:51.625 --> 00:08:52.549\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's not good.\n\n186\n00:08:52.549 --> 00:08:53.948\n&gt;&gt; That could be bad.\n\n187\n00:08:53.948 --> 00:08:57.600\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, especially with the backup,\nit's got everything.\n\n188\n00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:01.380\nSo, it's a good idea to\nencrypt your backup but\n\n189\n00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:04.810\nyou've got to be careful\nif you encrypt your backup.\n\n190\n00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:09.777\nIt's being encrypted using your\nprivate keys, your password, right?\n\n191\n00:09:09.777 --> 00:09:11.280\nWhat happens if you forget your password?\n\n192\n00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:15.519\nYou can't restore your backup and\nApple can't help you.\n\n193\n00:09:15.519 --> 00:09:18.670\nIt's encrypted, that's the private key,\nonly you knew it.\n\n194\n00:09:18.670 --> 00:09:22.710\nSo, if you encrypt it,\ndo not forget your password,\n\n195\n00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:24.220\nthat's a double whammy right there.\n\n196\n00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:26.630\nYou definitely don't want that to happen,\nso be careful with that.\n\n197\n00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:30.960\nAnd what I'll find is a lot of people\nwill say, I won't forget my password, but\n\n198\n00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:33.490\nthen they turn on\nsomething like auto log on.\n\n199\n00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:35.794\nAnd so, when they turn on their Mac,\ntheir Mac just automatically logs in and\n\n200\n00:09:35.794 --> 00:09:37.030\nthey don't type their password.\n\n201\n00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:42.560\nMonths go by and they haven't had to type\ntheir password and then they do forget.\n\n202\n00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:44.600\nThey forget their password and\nso, that's what can happen.\n\n203\n00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:45.840\nSo, we've gotta be careful with that.\n\n204\n00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:49.180\nNow for the show, I'm not going to\nencrypt but in real life, absolutely.\n\n205\n00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:53.120\nI encrypt my USB drive because, really,\nanybody could walk into the office and\n\n206\n00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:56.800\nsnag that drive and\nnow an entire set of my data is out there.\n\n207\n00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:59.670\nThey could take another MacBook somewhere,\nhook that drive up and\n\n208\n00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:02.296\nrestore the Time Machine backup and\nnow, they've got a clone of my laptop.\n\n209\n00:10:02.296 --> 00:10:07.690\nAnd that's definitely not something that I\nwant, so you usually want to encrypt that.\n\n210\n00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:10.850\nI'm gonna go ahead and say I'm gonna\nuse this as my backup disc, and\n\n211\n00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:14.060\nwhen I do that,\nit's going to configure Time Machine.\n\n212\n00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:16.070\nNow, it's already\nconfigured most of it for\n\n213\n00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:18.060\nme, it's saying that it's gonna back up.\n\n214\n00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:21.100\nIt's got 1.1 terabyte of space\navailable on this disk, and\n\n215\n00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:23.850\nthe next backup is gonna happen in,\nwell, two minutes.\n\n216\n00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:26.730\nIt started at 120 seconds,\nand is counting down.\n\n217\n00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:30.980\nIt's just creating a little two minute\ngap, and I don't actually know why it does\n\n218\n00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:34.260\nthat, as opposed to just jumping in and\nstarting to do the backup right away.\n\n219\n00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:37.200\nWe can actually force it to do\nthe backup right away if you want, or\n\n220\n00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:39.050\nyou can wait two minutes, either way.\n\n221\n00:10:39.050 --> 00:10:41.240\nBut see how it says to\nbackup automatically, so\n\n222\n00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:42.970\nit's automatically gonna\nback up the system.\n\n223\n00:10:42.970 --> 00:10:47.410\nIt's gonna do a full backup here, as soon\nas this two minute counter is done, and\n\n224\n00:10:47.410 --> 00:10:50.040\nthen it's gonna keep the backups.\n\n225\n00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:54.370\nIt will keep hourly backups for\nthe last 24 hours, so 24 backups,\n\n226\n00:10:54.370 --> 00:10:59.440\nand then after that, it will keep\ndaily backups for the last month.\n\n227\n00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:04.290\nJust one backup a day for the last 31\ndays, and then, weekly backups for\n\n228\n00:11:04.290 --> 00:11:08.640\nas far back as it can go until\nyour hard drive fills up.\n\n229\n00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:10.315\nEventually, your hard drive does fill up,\n\n230\n00:11:10.315 --> 00:11:14.530\nit has to overwrite old stuff to make\nroom for new stuff, so be aware of that.\n\n231\n00:11:14.530 --> 00:11:17.610\nYou wanna make sure that you pick a backup\nmedium that's bigger than the drive in\n\n232\n00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:19.080\nyour computer.\n\n233\n00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:22.717\nSo in my computer,\nI actually don't know how big my drive is.\n\n234\n00:11:22.717 --> 00:11:26.470\n[LAUGH] I was in disk utility,\nlet's see, if it'll tell me.\n\n235\n00:11:27.850 --> 00:11:29.370\nYeah.\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]\n\n236\n00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:30.850\n&gt;&gt; Well, this is a virtual machine so\n\n237\n00:11:30.850 --> 00:11:32.050\nit's something smaller, so yes,\n\n238\n00:11:32.050 --> 00:11:35.510\nin this case, like a 42 gig\ndrive apparently is what I have.\n\n239\n00:11:35.510 --> 00:11:37.950\nBut let's say, what you were saying,\n\n240\n00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:41.020\nin my physical machine I've\nactually got a 500 gig drive.\n\n241\n00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:42.760\nSo, if I have a 500 gig drive and\n\n242\n00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:46.920\nI have a 500 gig USB disk,\nhow many backups can I store?\n\n243\n00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:52.190\nWell, if my drive is completely full,\nonly one backup, right,but\n\n244\n00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:55.310\nif my drive is only half full then\nyou've got room for changes and so on.\n\n245\n00:11:55.310 --> 00:12:00.282\nBut if I have a 500 gig drive,\nand I get a 2 terabyte USB drive,\n\n246\n00:12:00.282 --> 00:12:06.087\nI'll be able to store a full copy of my\nsystem and changes for years on there.\n\n247\n00:12:06.087 --> 00:12:08.411\nRemember, we're only\nbacking up the changes and\n\n248\n00:12:08.411 --> 00:12:11.940\nthe bulk of what eats up your\ndisk space doesn't change.\n\n249\n00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:15.430\nApplication files,\nthey don't change unless there's updates,\n\n250\n00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:17.960\nMac OS really doesn't change\nunless there's an update.\n\n251\n00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:21.730\nSo, the bulk of what's on your hard\ndrive doesn't change and as a result,\n\n252\n00:12:21.730 --> 00:12:23.420\ndoesn't inflate your backup.\n\n253\n00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:26.290\nBut you'll wanna make sure that your\nbackup disk is larger than whatever\n\n254\n00:12:26.290 --> 00:12:28.220\nthe disk is in your system.\n\n255\n00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:31.870\nSo, in my case, it's significantly larger\nso it's gonna be able to handle that, and\n\n256\n00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:33.040\nthe backup is running.\n\n257\n00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:37.160\nAnd see how while my virtual machine here\nhad about 40 gigs of hard drive space,\n\n258\n00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:39.772\nit's only backing up 9 gigs,\ncuz most of my disk was empty.\n\n259\n00:12:39.772 --> 00:12:42.750\nIt's gotta basic install\nof macOS Sierra and\n\n260\n00:12:42.750 --> 00:12:45.440\nthat's it,\na basic install is about nine gigs.\n\n261\n00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:47.510\nThen, all the applications we load and\n\n262\n00:12:47.510 --> 00:12:50.980\nthe other software we load that's what\nstarts to inflate and make that bigger.\n\n263\n00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:55.777\nSo, be aware that your disutilization\nis going to impact how\n\n264\n00:12:55.777 --> 00:12:58.610\nmuch data you can actually backup.\n\n265\n00:12:58.610 --> 00:13:01.450\nAll right, that backup is running and\nwhat does that mean to me?\n\n266\n00:13:01.450 --> 00:13:06.030\nWell, if we go in here and\nbrowse into our hard drive, and\n\n267\n00:13:06.030 --> 00:13:07.720\nI'm browsing into that Time Machine disk.\n\n268\n00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:10.830\nYou'll see it created a folder\ncalled backups.backupdb,\n\n269\n00:13:10.830 --> 00:13:16.060\nthis is the backup database, and when\nyou browse into that, here's my laptop.\n\n270\n00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:19.740\nMy laptop's called LAB-CLIENT01,\nand if I browse into that,\n\n271\n00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:22.960\nhere's a backup that's in progress and\nit's got a timestamp.\n\n272\n00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:23.930\nOkay, well,\n\n273\n00:13:23.930 --> 00:13:27.260\nlooking at this back up its not very\nexciting because it's just running down.\n\n274\n00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:28.956\nSo, I going to show you one\nof my actual backups, so\n\n275\n00:13:28.956 --> 00:13:31.080\nyou guys can see what\na production system looks like.\n\n276\n00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:33.290\nBut I also wanna highlight this up here,\n\n277\n00:13:33.290 --> 00:13:36.310\nTime Machine is backing up\non an unencrypted disc.\n\n278\n00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:40.560\nIt's warning me, so, if I say, ooh,\nI really should have encrypted that.\n\n279\n00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:42.800\nThat would been the smart thing to do,\nright?\n\n280\n00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:48.032\nWell, you can go into your settings for\nTime Machine and you can change it.\n\n281\n00:13:48.032 --> 00:13:52.530\nNow as far as changing it, notice I don't\nreally have the whole lot options here.\n\n282\n00:13:52.530 --> 00:13:56.710\nIf I go to the Options menu,\nI can see the disk but\n\n283\n00:13:56.710 --> 00:13:59.820\neven here, I can't change it, all right.\n\n284\n00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:02.610\n&gt;&gt; Is that because you're in the middle\nof a current backup right now?\n\n285\n00:14:02.610 --> 00:14:05.100\n&gt;&gt; That's a part of it but\nthe other part is.\n\n286\n00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:08.320\nIt's got data on it that's unencrypted and\nwe'd have to cycle through to encrypt\n\n287\n00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:11.150\nthat, kinda like what FileVault does and\nit really doesn't like to do that.\n\n288\n00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:16.540\nIt's always best to enable encryption when\nyou're adding the disk to time machine.\n\n289\n00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:19.200\nFor two reason, one, it's easier and\n\n290\n00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:23.280\ntwo, the disk is empty at that point so\nthe encryption is very fast.\n\n291\n00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:26.860\nIf the disk is packed full of\nbackups it gonna take hours, well,\n\n292\n00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:28.410\ncycles through to encrypt that.\n\n293\n00:14:28.410 --> 00:14:31.930\nAnd on removable media,\nit's almost always slower than the storage\n\n294\n00:14:31.930 --> 00:14:35.160\ninside of your computer so\nit's gonna take a lot longer.\n\n295\n00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:39.170\nSo that's why we don't normally wanna\nenable this stuff after the fact, okay?\n\n296\n00:14:39.170 --> 00:14:43.140\nThere is one little option in here that I\ndo like to check though, right down here.\n\n297\n00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:47.420\nShow Time Machine in menu bar, I turn\nthis on in every computer that I use.\n\n298\n00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:52.380\nAnd what it does is it makes\nthe Time Machine icon appear right up here\n\n299\n00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:53.550\nat the top.\n\n300\n00:14:53.550 --> 00:14:54.160\nAnd it's nice,\n\n301\n00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:57.240\nbecause if you click on it you can see\nif you're doing a backup right now.\n\n302\n00:14:57.240 --> 00:14:59.710\nThere's times where I feel like my\ncomputer is running a little slow and\n\n303\n00:14:59.710 --> 00:15:00.980\nI'm like, what's going on?\n\n304\n00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:04.185\nAnd I'll hit that and I'm taking a backup,\nI just need to wait, right?\n\n305\n00:15:04.185 --> 00:15:05.870\nSo that it can help you, but\n\n306\n00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:09.500\nit also lets you do things like\ntake a backup immediately.\n\n307\n00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:12.430\nI see that it's backing up right now,\nbut if it wasn't\n\n308\n00:15:12.430 --> 00:15:15.880\nI'd have a different option here, telling\nit to go ahead and do a backup right now.\n\n309\n00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:17.870\nHey, go ahead and\ndo a backup right now, don't wait.\n\n310\n00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:20.570\nMaybe I'm about to make some change,\nso I want it to do a backup right now.\n\n311\n00:15:22.430 --> 00:15:26.110\nAll right, so I'm just gonna leave this\nsystem alone, it's doing it's backup and\n\n312\n00:15:26.110 --> 00:15:27.800\nI'm gonna switch over to my actual laptop.\n\n313\n00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:32.749\nSo, this is my actual laptop that\nI use here for the show, and\n\n314\n00:15:32.749 --> 00:15:36.452\non this system, I do have a 500 gig drive.\n\n315\n00:15:36.452 --> 00:15:41.583\nSo, here's my hard drive and\nit's 499.42 gigabytes.\n\n316\n00:15:41.583 --> 00:15:43.070\n&gt;&gt; It's not 500 though.\n\n317\n00:15:43.070 --> 00:15:46.320\n&gt;&gt; Well, it's close,\nthe way they advertise it,\n\n318\n00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:48.870\nit's advertised as a 512 gig,\nwhere's my 12 gig?\n\n319\n00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:49.529\n&gt;&gt; Liars.\n\n320\n00:15:49.529 --> 00:15:52.646\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's all differences\nin how we measure disk space.\n\n321\n00:15:52.646 --> 00:15:55.633\nBut either way,\nI've got my USB drive attached,\n\n322\n00:15:55.633 --> 00:15:58.209\nwhich is this other time machine, right?\n\n323\n00:15:58.209 --> 00:15:59.514\nSo, I plug that in.\n\n324\n00:15:59.514 --> 00:16:01.781\nAnd my system is set to use it.\n\n325\n00:16:01.781 --> 00:16:04.710\nNow if I look up here in my menu bar,\nthere's the icon.\n\n326\n00:16:04.710 --> 00:16:07.120\nRemember how I said I'd turn\nthat on in every system, and\n\n327\n00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:10.320\nI can see my latest backup\ntoday was at 11:22.\n\n328\n00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:11.371\nWell, what time is it?\n\n329\n00:16:11.371 --> 00:16:12.939\n11:37.\n\n330\n00:16:12.939 --> 00:16:15.110\nWell that's just a handful of minutes ago.\n\n331\n00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:17.920\nThat's while this show was going on,\nright?\n\n332\n00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:22.738\nSo back in the very beginning of this\nshow when Daniel is introducing himself,\n\n333\n00:16:22.738 --> 00:16:25.228\nmy laptop was probably taking a backup.\n\n334\n00:16:25.228 --> 00:16:27.200\nOr when I plugged it in it\nmight have taken a backup.\n\n335\n00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:29.800\nSomething at the beginning of the show,\nit started that backup process.\n\n336\n00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:32.700\nI didn't even notice,\nbecause it's only backing up what changed.\n\n337\n00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:35.900\nAnd what changed could be a very, very\nsmall amount of data, may not be anything.\n\n338\n00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:39.181\nMaybe nothing's changed on my\nlaptop since the last backup, but\n\n339\n00:16:39.181 --> 00:16:43.012\nI do have the Back Up Now option, so\nI can say, go and take a backup right now.\n\n340\n00:16:43.012 --> 00:16:45.730\nAnd it will get in there and\nback up whatever's changed.\n\n341\n00:16:45.730 --> 00:16:47.750\nAnd so if I hit that, it's gonna start.\n\n342\n00:16:47.750 --> 00:16:48.920\nSee, It's preparing the backup.\n\n343\n00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:51.728\nAnd by preparing, it's really just\nlooking for whatever's changed.\n\n344\n00:16:51.728 --> 00:16:54.900\nSo it's gonna find any changes in the\nsystem, and then it will take that backup.\n\n345\n00:16:54.900 --> 00:16:58.360\nAnd we'll find that it actually\nhappens much, much faster, right?\n\n346\n00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:02.320\nAnd I can skip this backup if I wanted\nto stop it, and then move on from there.\n\n347\n00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:05.560\nIf I open my Time Machine preferences,\nI can get in here and\n\n348\n00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:10.800\nsee that on my hard drive,\nI have 1 TB of storage.\n\n349\n00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:15.649\nBut it this is my Time Machine hard drive,\nbut I'm only using 627 gigs of it, right?\n\n350\n00:17:15.649 --> 00:17:18.076\nAnd that's because each backup\nisn't backing one change.\n\n351\n00:17:18.076 --> 00:17:19.355\nHere, I'm doing a backup.\n\n352\n00:17:19.355 --> 00:17:21.871\n3.4 gigs of data haven't changed.\n\n353\n00:17:21.871 --> 00:17:26.334\nWell, I just took a backup,\n12 minutes ago.\n\n354\n00:17:26.334 --> 00:17:29.050\nHow did I have three gigs in changes?\n\n355\n00:17:29.050 --> 00:17:31.730\nWell I'm running a virtual machine and\nvirtual machines, they\n\n356\n00:17:31.730 --> 00:17:34.500\nchange their files, the entire file has\nto be backed up, so that means I'm gonna\n\n357\n00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:38.250\nhave some rapid changes and see it will\ntake about 30 minutes to back that up.\n\n358\n00:17:38.250 --> 00:17:39.131\n&gt;&gt; That keeps rising too.\n\n359\n00:17:39.131 --> 00:17:41.268\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well the virtual machine,\n\n360\n00:17:41.268 --> 00:17:42.583\n[CROSSTALK] is still running.\n\n361\n00:17:42.583 --> 00:17:44.805\nAnd yeah,\nit kind of mucks things up a bit.\n\n362\n00:17:44.805 --> 00:17:46.483\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\ncancel this cancel this backup so\n\n363\n00:17:46.483 --> 00:17:47.658\nwe don't have to wait on that to happen.\n\n364\n00:17:47.658 --> 00:17:50.150\nBut basically,\nit's backing up that system.\n\n365\n00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:51.170\nI can control it right from here.\n\n366\n00:17:51.170 --> 00:17:53.130\nI can see what's going on.\n\n367\n00:17:53.130 --> 00:17:54.370\nI see those backups.\n\n368\n00:17:54.370 --> 00:17:59.220\nAnd as we look in here, I can come in and\nsee how when I choose that\n\n369\n00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:01.960\nTime Machine backup,\nencrypt backups is still grayed out.\n\n370\n00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:04.120\nEven though I'm not running a backup,\nit is still grayed out.\n\n371\n00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:06.570\nI'd really need to remove the disc, and\n\n372\n00:18:06.570 --> 00:18:11.090\nbring it back in in order to choose\nto encrypt it and get it that way.\n\n373\n00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:13.730\nNow notice how Time Machine\nshows up twice.\n\n374\n00:18:13.730 --> 00:18:17.050\nSee how it's up here as a backup disc and\nthen it's down here as an available disc.\n\n375\n00:18:17.050 --> 00:18:20.700\nAnd if I choose as an available disc,\nI can choose to encrypt it now, right?\n\n376\n00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:24.270\nThat's because there's free space on the\ndrive and it can leverage that free space.\n\n377\n00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:26.780\nBut that's not a good idea,\nbecause now I'm gonna have\n\n378\n00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:29.770\nsome backups that are unencrypted and\nsome that are encrypted.\n\n379\n00:18:29.770 --> 00:18:34.380\nThe best thing to do is to remove it and\nthen re-add it and choose to encrypt\n\n380\n00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:38.280\nthe whole thing at that point, and that\nwill give you the better protection there.\n\n381\n00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:40.250\nNow let's take a look at that disk.\n\n382\n00:18:40.250 --> 00:18:43.400\nWhen I showed you the one on my lab\nmachine it wasn't very full, but\n\n383\n00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:47.590\non this one, when I go into\nbackups.backupdb I see Don's MacBook Pro,\n\n384\n00:18:47.590 --> 00:18:52.400\nand when I browse into there I\nsee a lot of folders, right?\n\n385\n00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:54.280\nAnd these are all backups.\n\n386\n00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:59.220\nNow, today's date is April 17th,\nso there's today.\n\n387\n00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:04.040\nAnd if I look, I've got backups going\nall the way back to March 16th, okay?\n\n388\n00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:06.500\nSo I've got over a month\nworth of backups right here.\n\n389\n00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:10.308\nNow, that means one or two things,\neither a month ago I replaced this drive,\n\n390\n00:19:10.308 --> 00:19:12.373\nwhich I think is actually what happened.\n\n391\n00:19:12.373 --> 00:19:15.194\nOr today if we ran out\nof hard drive space, so\n\n392\n00:19:15.194 --> 00:19:19.292\nI started deleting stuff from\na month ago to do that backup.\n\n393\n00:19:19.292 --> 00:19:23.475\nActually March 16th, I remember what\nhappened, I went on vacation and\n\n394\n00:19:23.475 --> 00:19:26.330\nI sent my laptop in for warranty repair.\n\n395\n00:19:26.330 --> 00:19:30.365\nAnd when that happened,\nI reset my laptop and wiped it and\n\n396\n00:19:30.365 --> 00:19:31.315\nrestored it from a backup.\n\n397\n00:19:31.315 --> 00:19:33.275\nAnd so\nmy backup started over again right there.\n\n398\n00:19:33.275 --> 00:19:34.865\nSo that's what happened.\n\n399\n00:19:34.865 --> 00:19:37.635\nI actually did reset it back then.\n\n400\n00:19:37.635 --> 00:19:40.247\nBut each of these backups\nare tied to a date.\n\n401\n00:19:40.247 --> 00:19:44.067\nAnd if we look the April 17th one,\n\n402\n00:19:44.067 --> 00:19:48.567\nit's got back up in here each hour,\nthat is doing a back up, right?\n\n403\n00:19:48.567 --> 00:19:51.037\nBut then before that we\nstart getting in today's.\n\n404\n00:19:51.037 --> 00:19:55.458\nAnd so will see the 12th, the 11th,\nthe 10th, the 9th, the 8th, right?\n\n405\n00:19:55.458 --> 00:19:58.478\nSo there's backups that\nare going everyday and\n\n406\n00:19:58.478 --> 00:20:02.318\nthen as we go back a little bit further,\nit'll start to jump to weeklies, right?\n\n407\n00:20:02.318 --> 00:20:03.660\nWell mine is has been running long enough.\n\n408\n00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:06.010\nBut see how there's a gap\nbetween the 16th and the 20th,\n\n409\n00:20:06.010 --> 00:20:09.053\nthat's either skipping weeklies or it\nmeans unhook the drive for a few days and\n\n410\n00:20:09.053 --> 00:20:10.454\ndidn't plug in, one or the other.\n\n411\n00:20:10.454 --> 00:20:11.625\nBut it's backing this up.\n\n412\n00:20:11.625 --> 00:20:15.153\nNow if I wanted to find the file,\nthis gets really challenging cuz when I'm\n\n413\n00:20:15.153 --> 00:20:18.857\nbrowsing into one of these folders,\nlike when I'm browsing to April 10th.\n\n414\n00:20:18.857 --> 00:20:22.622\nI see Macintosh HD and\nI can browse in there and I see users, and\n\n415\n00:20:22.622 --> 00:20:25.200\nI browse in there and I see D Pezet,\n&gt;&gt; It just\n\n416\n00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:29.100\nlooks just like it does when you click\non my hard drive or whatever inside.\n\n417\n00:20:29.100 --> 00:20:32.580\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the difference here is just I'm\nseeing older versions of these files.\n\n418\n00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:34.530\nAnd I can browse in and\nI can look at my desktop, and\n\n419\n00:20:34.530 --> 00:20:37.440\nhere if you look at my desktop,\nI've got a folder called paragon.\n\n420\n00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:42.070\nAnd I've got a couple of our podcast\nepisodes that are sitting right there.\n\n421\n00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:45.728\nBut if I look at my desktop right now,\nI've got a folder called podcast.\n\n422\n00:20:45.728 --> 00:20:47.920\nI don't have folder called paragon, and\n\n423\n00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:49.500\nthe individual podcast\nfiles are sitting here.\n\n424\n00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:53.490\nSo back on April whatever this was.\n\n425\n00:20:53.490 --> 00:20:54.710\nI forget what folder I clicked on.\n\n426\n00:20:54.710 --> 00:20:56.080\nBut back on whatever date this was,\n\n427\n00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:58.960\nI had different things on my\ndesktop than I do now, all right?\n\n428\n00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:01.830\nThe thing is, navigating this\nway is kind of annoying, right?\n\n429\n00:21:01.830 --> 00:21:03.630\nEspecially if I don't know\nwhen I deleted a file.\n\n430\n00:21:03.630 --> 00:21:05.780\nI'm like, man when did I delete that file?\n\n431\n00:21:05.780 --> 00:21:08.550\nSo one of the things that\nmakes life a little easier\n\n432\n00:21:08.550 --> 00:21:11.390\nis that you can do what's\ncalled entering Time Machine.\n\n433\n00:21:11.390 --> 00:21:13.126\nWhen I pull down that menu up top,\n\n434\n00:21:13.126 --> 00:21:15.868\nI had an option up here that\nsays enter Time Machine.\n\n435\n00:21:15.868 --> 00:21:21.050\nAnd when you enter that Time Machine,\nthe view's gonna change like this.\n\n436\n00:21:21.050 --> 00:21:24.620\nAll right, and\nwhat we're seeing is a folder.\n\n437\n00:21:24.620 --> 00:21:26.660\nI'm seeing my desktop, right?\n\n438\n00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:30.090\nAnd this is my desktop\nright now as it is today.\n\n439\n00:21:30.090 --> 00:21:32.930\nSo it actually says that, today now, okay?\n\n440\n00:21:32.930 --> 00:21:37.650\nBut over here on the right side of\nmy screen, I've got this timeline.\n\n441\n00:21:37.650 --> 00:21:41.230\nAnd it's showing me all the back\nups that are available.\n\n442\n00:21:41.230 --> 00:21:44.420\nAnd I can click on any particular date.\n\n443\n00:21:44.420 --> 00:21:46.790\nAnd I can say,\nboy what happened to my paragon folder?\n\n444\n00:21:46.790 --> 00:21:47.860\nWhere is that, right?\n\n445\n00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:51.190\nI want the most recent copy\nof the paragon folder.\n\n446\n00:21:51.190 --> 00:21:54.130\nI know I can go back to something really\nold, and I'll have the paragon folder.\n\n447\n00:21:54.130 --> 00:21:55.690\nBut I want the most recent one.\n\n448\n00:21:55.690 --> 00:21:59.473\nI don't know when I deleted it, you can\npick kind of a random date over here.\n\n449\n00:21:59.473 --> 00:22:02.530\nSo I'm gonna pick April 1st, right?\n\n450\n00:22:02.530 --> 00:22:06.814\nSo I'm gonna jump all the way back to\nApril 1st, no paragon folder, right?\n\n451\n00:22:06.814 --> 00:22:09.299\nNo podcast folder either, right?\n\n452\n00:22:09.299 --> 00:22:11.356\nSo those have changed, so\nI can keep going back.\n\n453\n00:22:11.356 --> 00:22:16.156\nI'll jump back to March 24th and\nnow my desktop is empty,\n\n454\n00:22:16.156 --> 00:22:18.720\nand we'll just keep going.\n\n455\n00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:19.766\nMy goodness, where-\n&gt;&gt; Don,\n\n456\n00:22:19.766 --> 00:22:22.237\ndoes not believe in his\ndesktop being a folder.\n\n457\n00:22:22.237 --> 00:22:23.114\n&gt;&gt; I know, yeah.\n\n458\n00:22:23.114 --> 00:22:25.200\n&gt;&gt; He keeps it clean.\n\n459\n00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:26.680\n&gt;&gt; I generally don't keep\na whole lot on there.\n\n460\n00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:28.940\nAnd shoot, did I just see it pop up?\n\n461\n00:22:28.940 --> 00:22:31.380\nSo this is the hardest part,\nit's just kinda finding the thing.\n\n462\n00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:34.950\nNow, here's the thing, I might have had\nthat paragon folder just for one day.\n\n463\n00:22:34.950 --> 00:22:35.537\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n464\n00:22:35.537 --> 00:22:37.790\n&gt;&gt; And you have to find that exact-\n&gt;&gt; I'd have to find that exact days.\n\n465\n00:22:37.790 --> 00:22:40.330\nThat is one of the challenges\nthat we have to face with this.\n\n466\n00:22:40.330 --> 00:22:44.416\nBut when you get kind of close,\nyou can find a folder like this one, and\n\n467\n00:22:44.416 --> 00:22:48.790\nyou can use these up and down arrows\nover here to just move individual days.\n\n468\n00:22:48.790 --> 00:22:53.426\nAnd move back between what's changed, so I\ncan step back and view it on the 14th and\n\n469\n00:22:53.426 --> 00:22:53.962\n13th.\n\n470\n00:22:53.962 --> 00:22:57.570\nAnd I kind of keep going like this,\nuntil that paragon folder pops up.\n\n471\n00:22:57.570 --> 00:23:01.090\nAnd if I collapse this.\n\n472\n00:23:01.090 --> 00:23:03.823\nEvery now and then, you'll see\nwhere it skips more than one day.\n\n473\n00:23:03.823 --> 00:23:04.470\nHave you noticed that?\n\n474\n00:23:04.470 --> 00:23:07.250\nLike there just went one,\nand then here just one.\n\n475\n00:23:08.270 --> 00:23:08.990\nThere.\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n\n476\n00:23:08.990 --> 00:23:11.030\n&gt;&gt; There it went like three or\nfour, right?\n\n477\n00:23:11.030 --> 00:23:14.120\nThat means three or four days went\nby with no changes to that folder.\n\n478\n00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:17.126\nAnd so it just skips over those days,\nthere were no changes, why show them?\n\n479\n00:23:17.126 --> 00:23:22.147\nSo from April 5th to April 6th,\nthere's that paragon folder.\n\n480\n00:23:22.147 --> 00:23:25.771\nAnd then I can move forward and say, all\nright, well from April 6th all the way to\n\n481\n00:23:25.771 --> 00:23:29.410\nApril 10th, it must have been\non April 10th that I deleted it.\n\n482\n00:23:29.410 --> 00:23:33.390\nSo I can go back to April 6th,\nthere's my paragon folder and\n\n483\n00:23:33.390 --> 00:23:35.770\nI can just right click on that and\nrestore it.\n\n484\n00:23:35.770 --> 00:23:36.980\nAnd if I restore it, it'll put it back.\n\n485\n00:23:36.980 --> 00:23:39.070\nNow, I have to be careful.\n\n486\n00:23:39.070 --> 00:23:44.660\nIf I have a paragon folder right now, it's\ngonna overwrite that folder with this one.\n\n487\n00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:45.570\nI may not want that.\n\n488\n00:23:45.570 --> 00:23:49.120\nMaybe I want my new folder and I just\nwanna get something out of the old one.\n\n489\n00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:51.448\nSo if that's the case,\nyou don't have to restore it,\n\n490\n00:23:51.448 --> 00:23:52.925\nyou can just browse right into it.\n\n491\n00:23:52.925 --> 00:23:56.668\nAnd when you browse into it, you can\nget the files that you need, right?\n\n492\n00:23:56.668 --> 00:23:57.864\nThis is Paragon Software,\n\n493\n00:23:57.864 --> 00:24:00.420\nthey make software that lets\nyou read other file systems.\n\n494\n00:24:00.420 --> 00:24:01.461\nSo if you wanna read like a.\n\n495\n00:24:01.461 --> 00:24:06.009\nA Windows hard drive on your Mac,\nyou can use their NTFS software.\n\n496\n00:24:06.009 --> 00:24:10.342\nSo I can come in here, and\nI can take that file that I wanted,\n\n497\n00:24:10.342 --> 00:24:12.570\nand I can just copy it.\n\n498\n00:24:12.570 --> 00:24:16.370\nOr I can restore it, or I can copy it and\nsend it to a different location.\n\n499\n00:24:16.370 --> 00:24:17.820\nI can run it right from here.\n\n500\n00:24:17.820 --> 00:24:21.208\nBut if I copy it, now I can take it,\nI go right to my desktop and\n\n501\n00:24:21.208 --> 00:24:24.864\nI can paste it there or wherever it\nis I need it without overwriting\n\n502\n00:24:24.864 --> 00:24:29.205\nthe existing data, makes it supper easy\nto get in and out of this, all right?\n\n503\n00:24:29.205 --> 00:24:34.128\nThe other is, if I wanna restore\nan individual file this is great, but\n\n504\n00:24:34.128 --> 00:24:37.840\nwhat if I wanna restore my whole laptop,\nright?\n\n505\n00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:41.350\nWhat if just my whole laptop is messed\nup maybe I got ransomware right?\n\n506\n00:24:41.350 --> 00:24:44.210\nAnd some files got encrypted well\n\n507\n00:24:44.210 --> 00:24:49.000\ndon't break out your Bitcoins\ninstead you can boot to recovery.\n\n508\n00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:53.580\nAnd in recovery you have the option to\nrestore your Mac from Time Machine.\n\n509\n00:24:53.580 --> 00:24:57.800\nAnd it can read your Time Machine backup\nand restore the entire laptop or desktop.\n\n510\n00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:01.400\nIt will format the drive Including\nall these encrypted files and\n\n511\n00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:02.500\nwhatever it is that did it, right?\n\n512\n00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:03.540\nThe nasty stuff.\n\n513\n00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:07.350\nAnd then restore it from the Time Machine\ndrive and put everything back.\n\n514\n00:25:07.350 --> 00:25:10.260\nIt didn't even cost you a single Bitcoin,\nright?\n\n515\n00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:11.490\nAnd it's super easy.\n\n516\n00:25:11.490 --> 00:25:14.820\nThat's really what Time Machine is all\nabout, is this being super convenient.\n\n517\n00:25:14.820 --> 00:25:17.490\nSo definitely a nice thing to have.\n\n518\n00:25:17.490 --> 00:25:22.600\nYou also see Time Machine as\na mechanism for moving to a new laptop.\n\n519\n00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:24.940\nSo Daniel is about to upgrade his laptop,\nright.\n\n520\n00:25:24.940 --> 00:25:27.580\nSo your MacBook is-\n&gt;&gt; Two and a half years old.\n\n521\n00:25:27.580 --> 00:25:31.140\n&gt;&gt; So creeping up on that three\nyear limit for a warranty, right.\n\n522\n00:25:31.140 --> 00:25:33.400\nAnd so you get a new MacBook.\n\n523\n00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:37.070\nNow you gotta reinstall your applications,\nyou gotta setup all your stuff.\n\n524\n00:25:37.070 --> 00:25:41.960\nYou you got text, editors and things, that\nyou've customized and it's a nightmare.\n\n525\n00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:44.780\nLike, how long did it take you to get\na new laptop setup a few from scratch?\n\n526\n00:25:44.780 --> 00:25:47.390\n&gt;&gt; My goodness, It's gonna take you\nforever depending on how much data.\n\n527\n00:25:48.570 --> 00:25:50.240\nOn these laptops it's gonna\ntake me a little while.\n\n528\n00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:51.818\nGot a bunch of virtual machines on here.\n\n529\n00:25:51.818 --> 00:25:54.220\nIt's just gonna gonna take a lot of\n\n530\n00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:57.430\neffort on my part if I'm not using\nsomething like Time Machine.\n\n531\n00:25:57.430 --> 00:25:58.410\n&gt;&gt; But if you get a new laptop and\n\n532\n00:25:58.410 --> 00:26:02.260\nyou have a Time Machine backup when that\ninitial configuration wizard launches it\n\n533\n00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:04.320\nasks where you want to\ntransfer your settings from.\n\n534\n00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:06.904\nAnd you can plug in that\nTime Machine drive and\n\n535\n00:26:06.904 --> 00:26:10.308\nit will restore everything from\nthere onto the new laptop.\n\n536\n00:26:10.308 --> 00:26:12.800\nAnd now you're ready to go,\nand it took maybe an hour.\n\n537\n00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:15.970\nHowever long it took to restore the data\noff of that drive to the internal disk-\n\n538\n00:26:15.970 --> 00:26:18.030\n&gt;&gt; And it's not you, like, working, going,\n\n539\n00:26:18.030 --> 00:26:19.260\nokay, I gotta copy these files.\n\n540\n00:26:19.260 --> 00:26:21.260\nI gotta copy that files,\nlet me put those in the right spot.\n\n541\n00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:25.090\nLet me put this here,\nyeah you could delete this.\n\n542\n00:26:25.090 --> 00:26:27.468\nYou just plug it in and say transfer.\n\n543\n00:26:27.468 --> 00:26:29.540\nAnd you step back,\ngo get a cup of coffee or do whatever,\n\n544\n00:26:29.540 --> 00:26:30.520\nand have a good time, right?\n\n545\n00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:31.900\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely right, yeah.\n\n546\n00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:35.370\nAnd let's say you have a laptop\nthat's not under warranty, right?\n\n547\n00:26:35.370 --> 00:26:38.190\nSo maybe you bought the three\nyear Apple Care, whatever, and\n\n548\n00:26:38.190 --> 00:26:41.050\nyou're on year four,\ncuz laptops will run for a long time.\n\n549\n00:26:41.050 --> 00:26:43.855\nWell, my laptop,\nthe warranty's up in 10 days, right?\n\n550\n00:26:43.855 --> 00:26:45.460\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's not like my laptop's gonna\n\n551\n00:26:45.460 --> 00:26:46.440\ndie in ten days.\n\n552\n00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:50.540\nBut, in 11 days, if something goes\nwrong with it, I got to fix it myself.\n\n553\n00:26:50.540 --> 00:26:53.930\nSo if the hard drive dies in it, I might\ngo out and buy a different hard drive and\n\n554\n00:26:53.930 --> 00:26:55.280\npop it in here.\n\n555\n00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:57.820\nWhen I do that the hard\ndrive is completely blank.\n\n556\n00:26:57.820 --> 00:26:59.940\nSo when I push the power on\nmy Mac what am I gonna get?\n\n557\n00:26:59.940 --> 00:27:04.010\nI'm wanna get a little sad Mac icon,\nright a little friendly face.\n\n558\n00:27:04.010 --> 00:27:07.210\nIs not gonna be able to boot, I don't\nthink it do a sad Mac anymore now is like\n\n559\n00:27:07.210 --> 00:27:09.180\na question mark on a drive\nthat's gonna come up.\n\n560\n00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:13.350\nSo what I can do is I can plug\nin a time Time Machine disk and\n\n561\n00:27:13.350 --> 00:27:17.120\none thing is not really well\ndocumented on Apple site Is that\n\n562\n00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:20.580\nthe recovery partition on your laptop,\nor on your desktop.\n\n563\n00:27:20.580 --> 00:27:23.770\nThis actually a copy that recovery\npartition stored on your Time Machine\n\n564\n00:27:23.770 --> 00:27:27.530\ndisk, so\nyou can boot off of the Time Machine disk.\n\n565\n00:27:27.530 --> 00:27:31.630\nSo I can plug in my USB drive, and\nwhen I power the computer I can hold down\n\n566\n00:27:31.630 --> 00:27:34.690\nthe option key, and\nI'll see the list of bootable disks, so\n\n567\n00:27:34.690 --> 00:27:37.630\nmy internal disk won't be bootable\nbecause it's completely blank.\n\n568\n00:27:37.630 --> 00:27:40.910\nBut the Time Machine disk is and\nI can choose it and it'll load recovery.\n\n569\n00:27:40.910 --> 00:27:45.040\nAnd when it loads recovery I can specify\nto restore everything from Time Machine.\n\n570\n00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:48.470\nAnd it'll put this completely blank\nhard drive back into straight up,\n\n571\n00:27:48.470 --> 00:27:50.180\nready to work, operational shape.\n\n572\n00:27:50.180 --> 00:27:51.900\nAnd then we're back in business.\n\n573\n00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:54.010\nYou can also use Internet recovery.\n\n574\n00:27:54.010 --> 00:27:57.090\nIf you don't have either, if you don't\nhave a drive you can boot off of and\n\n575\n00:27:57.090 --> 00:27:58.570\nyour internal disk is blank.\n\n576\n00:27:58.570 --> 00:28:02.190\nEvery Mac made in the last four\nyears will reach out to Apple,\n\n577\n00:28:02.190 --> 00:28:03.540\nif it's got wireless connectivity.\n\n578\n00:28:03.540 --> 00:28:07.230\nIt will reach out to Apple, connect up,\nand download recovery from them.\n\n579\n00:28:07.230 --> 00:28:10.380\nIt's slow, but it does work and\nit'll get you in.\n\n580\n00:28:10.380 --> 00:28:13.320\nSo booting off of that\nTime Machine disk is a lot faster.\n\n581\n00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:17.120\n&gt;&gt; Well that's definitely a nice option\nthat the good folks over at Apple.\n\n582\n00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:19.620\nHave a whole lot to ask for,\nbecause you know what?\n\n583\n00:28:19.620 --> 00:28:23.990\nWhen it comes to laptops, comes to\npersonal computers, things happen, people.\n\n584\n00:28:23.990 --> 00:28:25.240\nYou gotta be prepared for that, and\n\n585\n00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:27.970\nthat's the whole purpose of\nbeing able to use something.\n\n586\n00:28:27.970 --> 00:28:31.330\nAnd they've developed the whole\nTime Machine backup system.\n\n587\n00:28:31.330 --> 00:28:33.660\nIs because A,\nthey want to make it super easy for\n\n588\n00:28:33.660 --> 00:28:39.180\nyou to be able to recover From loss of\ndata, or even loss of the entire system.\n\n589\n00:28:39.180 --> 00:28:42.400\nYou never know, but Don talked about\ndropping in a five-gallon bucket.\n\n590\n00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:46.865\nYou'd be surprised at how many laptops\nfind their way into some sort of liquid.\n\n591\n00:28:46.865 --> 00:28:50.080\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It happens more than you would think.\n\n592\n00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:52.600\nAnd when that does occur,\nyou wanna be able to restore,\n\n593\n00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:56.230\nyou wanna be able to recover, and\nnot have too much pain in doing so.\n\n594\n00:28:56.230 --> 00:28:59.200\nAnd they've done a great job of\nmaking that a reality for us.\n\n595\n00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:02.150\nNow, is there anything else that we\nneed to cover when it comes to backing\n\n596\n00:29:02.150 --> 00:29:03.230\nup using Time Machine.\n\n597\n00:29:03.230 --> 00:29:05.810\nOr just any Time Machine features\nthat we'd need to know about?\n\n598\n00:29:05.810 --> 00:29:07.370\n&gt;&gt; We've covered all the ones\nthat are on the exam, but\n\n599\n00:29:07.370 --> 00:29:11.510\nfor real life land, just remember\nthat you can cycle out USB disks.\n\n600\n00:29:11.510 --> 00:29:14.100\nSo you can actually take\nthree removable drives and\n\n601\n00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:15.250\nset them all up for Time Machine.\n\n602\n00:29:15.250 --> 00:29:17.610\nAnd then rotate them out.\n\n603\n00:29:17.610 --> 00:29:20.330\nThat can be useful if you\nwanna take one off site.\n\n604\n00:29:20.330 --> 00:29:23.310\nIf you're just trying to retain data over\na long period of time you get a big enough\n\n605\n00:29:23.310 --> 00:29:24.500\ndisk you don't need that.\n\n606\n00:29:24.500 --> 00:29:26.580\nBut you might have one that\nyou wanna keep at home and\n\n607\n00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:27.550\none that you keep at the office.\n\n608\n00:29:27.550 --> 00:29:29.820\nThat way if the office burns\ndown you've got a second copy.\n\n609\n00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:31.460\nSo you can always do that.\n\n610\n00:29:31.460 --> 00:29:34.200\nAnd then as far as Time Machine\ndestinations I keep talking about\n\n611\n00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:39.400\nremovable disks but remember, you can have\ntime capsule or you can have a server.\n\n612\n00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:43.430\nAnother machine set up with OS X server\non it and you can back up to that too.\n\n613\n00:29:43.430 --> 00:29:46.414\nThat's nice cuz you can\nhave all the laptops and\n\n614\n00:29:46.414 --> 00:29:49.854\ndesktops in your business\nall back up to one location.\n\n615\n00:29:49.854 --> 00:29:53.258\nSo now your back up is stored with\none place and that's a nice thing if\n\n616\n00:29:53.258 --> 00:29:57.411\na laptop got stolen or whatever you know\nthe backup are right there on that server.\n\n617\n00:29:57.411 --> 00:30:01.644\nAnd if you have a network backup like that\nis really cool because if I take my laptop\n\n618\n00:30:01.644 --> 00:30:04.740\nhome its not gonna see\nthe network backups, right?\n\n619\n00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:07.680\nBut as soon as I come in to the office and\nconnects to network it finds that and\n\n620\n00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:08.780\nits start backing up.\n\n621\n00:30:08.780 --> 00:30:10.650\nThe end users don't even\nhave to know about it.\n\n622\n00:30:10.650 --> 00:30:12.830\nIt just backs up silently in\nthe background right over the network.\n\n623\n00:30:12.830 --> 00:30:15.910\nSo those are some more advanced used\ncase scenarios for Time Machine.\n\n624\n00:30:15.910 --> 00:30:19.190\nDefinitely ones that you want to take\nadvantage of in a business environment.\n\n625\n00:30:19.190 --> 00:30:20.300\n&gt;&gt; Definitely very cool stuff.\n\n626\n00:30:20.300 --> 00:30:22.700\nYou gotta love that automated thing,\nI don't have to touch it.\n\n627\n00:30:22.700 --> 00:30:25.810\nI just connect and it's done for me.\n\n628\n00:30:25.810 --> 00:30:27.850\nThat's the thing that I like in my life.\n\n629\n00:30:27.850 --> 00:30:29.430\nEspecially when it comes to my computers.\n\n630\n00:30:29.430 --> 00:30:31.570\nThat being said it does look\nlike we are out of time for\n\n631\n00:30:31.570 --> 00:30:36.020\nthis episode but good news is we\ngot it all right into one series or\n\n632\n00:30:36.020 --> 00:30:39.080\none episode right instead of jumping\napart two, five, seven, and nine.\n\n633\n00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:42.190\nThat's a lot of work, Don likes to talk\n&gt;&gt; Yeah\n\n634\n00:30:42.190 --> 00:30:43.670\n&gt;&gt; So, keep him down to a minimum so\n\n635\n00:30:43.670 --> 00:30:46.590\ngood job Don and\nit does like I said it's time for\n\n636\n00:30:46.590 --> 00:30:48.968\nus to sign off we do appreciate\nyou guys watching us though.\n\n637\n00:30:48.968 --> 00:30:51.920\nAnd for\nITProTV I've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n638\n00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:52.640\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n639\n00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:55.271\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n640\n00:30:55.271 --> 00:31:01.292\n[MUSIC]\n\n641\n00:31:01.292 --> 00:31:04.191\nThank you for watching, ITPRO.TV.\n\n",
