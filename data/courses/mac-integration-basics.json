          "transcript": "1\n00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,102\n[MUSIC]\n\n2\n00:00:08,102 --> 00:00:12,159\nSo I want to take a moment to talk about\nthe Apple Certified Associates and\n\n3\n00:00:12,159 --> 00:00:14,886\nparticularly the Mac\nIntegration Basics Exam,\n\n4\n00:00:14,886 --> 00:00:19,825\nthat we can take to obtain the Apple\nCertified Associate Certification.\n\n5\n00:00:19,825 --> 00:00:22,775\nFirst off, the ACA,\nthe Apple Certified Associate,\n\n6\n00:00:22,775 --> 00:00:24,990\nwe'll see how many times\nI can say it in a minute.\n\n7\n00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:29,392\n[LAUGH] So the ACA it's an entry\nlevel certification with Apple\n\n8\n00:00:29,392 --> 00:00:34,112\nthat shows that you have or\nthe tester has a basic understanding of\n\n9\n00:00:34,112 --> 00:00:38,792\nhow to use Mac OS in a corporate or\nenterprise environment.\n\n10\n00:00:38,792 --> 00:00:42,612\nThere's two versions of this,\nthe Mac Management Basics,\n\n11\n00:00:42,612 --> 00:00:46,640\nwhich we cover in another show, and\nthis one the Mac Integration Basics.\n\n12\n00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:51,630\nWith Mac Integration we're looking\nat topics that surround using a Mac,\n\n13\n00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:55,075\na machine specifically\nrunning OS X Mavericks or\n\n14\n00:00:55,075 --> 00:00:58,130\nOS 10 Mavericks in\na corporate environment.\n\n15\n00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:01,310\nSo an environment where you\nhave more than one Mac.\n\n16\n00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:04,240\nAnybody can fire up a Mac laptop or\ndesktop and get to work.\n\n17\n00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:06,960\nRight?\nUsing it by itself is really pretty easy.\n\n18\n00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,990\nBut when we start integrating, using the\nMac with other systems, there's a couple\n\n19\n00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:15,060\nof things that we need to be aware of, and\nthat's what this certification covers.\n\n20\n00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:18,530\nWe take a look at getting Macs to\nparticipate together on a network, so\n\n21\n00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:20,320\njust sharing files, printers,\n\n22\n00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:24,100\nother things like that between\nmultiple systems running Mac OS.\n\n23\n00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:28,340\nWe also take a look at integrating\nour systems with Windows machines,\n\n24\n00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:29,600\nbecause in a lot of corporate and\n\n25\n00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,780\nbusiness environments, you're going to\nhave Microsoft Windows pretty heavily.\n\n26\n00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:36,930\nI think it's something like 80% of\nthe business market share right now.\n\n27\n00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:41,810\nSo while you might be firmly entrenched\nin the Mac world, many people aren't.\n\n28\n00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:45,160\nAnd so we need to get our\nsystems playing nicely together.\n\n29\n00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,990\nSo we take a look at doing file\nsharing and sharing printers,\n\n30\n00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:51,090\nstuff like that, between a Mac and\na Windows machine.\n\n31\n00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:54,470\nAnd we'll look at how we can migrate,\nso maybe you're making the switch or\n\n32\n00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:57,430\nyou're getting rid of those Windows\nmachines, and you're moving over to Mac.\n\n33\n00:01:57,430 --> 00:02:00,870\nSo we'll take a look at how to bring\nour user data over, our settings,\n\n34\n00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:04,450\nour files, all that good stuff, and\nmake that transition a little bit easier.\n\n35\n00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:08,460\nBecause you know how it is with end users,\nthey're always resistant to change.\n\n36\n00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:11,630\nWe wanna make things as painless as\npossible to get them to move over.\n\n37\n00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:14,730\nSo those are some of the topics\nthat we take a look at,\n\n38\n00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:17,310\nas we go through this certification.\n\n39\n00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:20,890\nNow, let me talk just a little bit\nabout attaining this certification.\n\n40\n00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:23,680\nThe certification itself\nis pretty straight forward.\n\n41\n00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:28,180\nThis is one of the ones I really like,\nbecause it is so straight forward.\n\n42\n00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:32,430\nThe exam is a 50 question,\nI'm sorry a 45 question\n\n43\n00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:37,840\nexam that is based entirely\non the content from one book.\n\n44\n00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,780\nOne book that is made available for\nfree online.\n\n45\n00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:42,120\nThat's part of what makes this so awesome.\n\n46\n00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,190\nThis is an extremely low\ncost certification to get.\n\n47\n00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:46,030\nAnd for an entry level certification,\n\n48\n00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:47,660\nthere's absolutely no\nreason you shouldn't do it.\n\n49\n00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:49,640\nIt looks great on the resume.\n\n50\n00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,110\nSo where do we get that book?\n\n51\n00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:53,610\nWell, what we do is we\ngo to Apple's website.\n\n52\n00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:56,430\nAnd Apple has a website dedicated\nto their certifications,\n\n53\n00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:00,074\nit's training.apple.com/certification.\n\n54\n00:03:00,074 --> 00:03:01,910\nAnd if you jump over to that website,\n\n55\n00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:04,760\nyou'll see on there where they've got\ntheir creative certifications for\n\n56\n00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:09,400\nthe design professionals, and then the IT\nprofessionals, that's what we're doing.\n\n57\n00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,570\nThis is a Maverick certification, so\n\n58\n00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:16,030\nevery time a new version of Mac OS comes\nout they update the certifications.\n\n59\n00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:17,220\nIt's usually not right away.\n\n60\n00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:20,070\nSo for example at this time,\n\n61\n00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:23,080\nI know you guys are probably watching\nthis video later on in the future.\n\n62\n00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:27,804\nBut at this time they've announced\nMac OS Yosemite the next version which is\n\n63\n00:03:27,804 --> 00:03:28,899\ngoing to be 10.10.\n\n64\n00:03:28,899 --> 00:03:32,330\nBut the 10.10 certifications\nwon't come out until well\n\n65\n00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:34,710\nafter the OS is actually in our hands.\n\n66\n00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:36,990\nSo right now Mavericks\nis the most recent on,\n\n67\n00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:40,410\nand if you go into that\nMavericks certifications link.\n\n68\n00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:44,120\nYou'll see where they detail the four\ncertification exams that they\n\n69\n00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,520\nhave right now.\n\n70\n00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:49,130\nActually, it's five,\nit's a four certifications, five tests.\n\n71\n00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:53,880\nThe Apple certified associate, you'll see\nthere's two different ones listed here.\n\n72\n00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:56,020\nOne for Mac Management Basics, and one for\n\n73\n00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:59,360\nMac Integration Basics,\nthey're both very similar.\n\n74\n00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,100\nAnd see how it says,\nthat they're available online.\n\n75\n00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:06,240\nIf you want to pursue your Apple Certified\nAssociate, you just come in here.\n\n76\n00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,060\nAnd if you click on it,\n\n77\n00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:09,880\nyou'll see where they tell you what\nyou need to do to get certified.\n\n78\n00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,810\nYou need to take that exam,\nand here's the PDF.\n\n79\n00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:17,170\nYou can download this manual right here.\n\n80\n00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:18,720\nThis is the book.\n\n81\n00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,040\nIt's not very, very giant at all.\n\n82\n00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,630\nYou can sit down and read this over\nthe course of one or maybe two days and\n\n83\n00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:25,830\nget the material.\n\n84\n00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:28,570\nAll the test questions come\nright from this book, so\n\n85\n00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:30,040\nit's a great resource to have.\n\n86\n00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:34,060\nWe really don't need too much\nelse to get ready for the exam.\n\n87\n00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:36,580\nWhen you're ready to actually take\nthe exam, you'll see back here,\n\n88\n00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:38,090\nwhere it says available online.\n\n89\n00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:40,350\nI'm just gonna hit that\navailable online link.\n\n90\n00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:43,700\nAnd it takes you to a page and\ndescribes the exam itself.\n\n91\n00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:48,530\nSo it tells you it is $65, and\nthat you can take it through Pearson VUE.\n\n92\n00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:53,580\nPearson VUE is a company that does\ncertification exams all across the world.\n\n93\n00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:57,080\nThis is one of the special exams\nthough that you can take online.\n\n94\n00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,830\nYou don't actually have to go\nto a Pearson VUE Center or\n\n95\n00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:01,860\nto an Apple Authorized Training Center.\n\n96\n00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:04,650\nYou can, if you want,\nyou can go to an AATC.\n\n97\n00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:09,150\nBut if you're like me, the nearest\nAATC to me is two hours drive away.\n\n98\n00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:11,480\nI have to drive two hours\nto go take this exam.\n\n99\n00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,400\nBut you can take this one online.\n\n100\n00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:16,170\nIf you wanna do it online,\nnotice this code.\n\n101\n00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:19,990\nEnter MavOSX109, right there.\n\n102\n00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:23,830\nSo that code is what will allow you\nto take it online instead of going\n\n103\n00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:24,410\nto a center.\n\n104\n00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:28,050\nAnd it's right here on the webpage,\nso you just copy that code.\n\n105\n00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:32,340\nSo you've got it, if you can master\nthe copy the command here which,\n\n106\n00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:36,570\nI'm screwing up, and then we can jump\non over to Pearson's website, and\n\n107\n00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:38,290\nsign up to take the exam.\n\n108\n00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:41,100\nSo when you go here,\nyou'll be able to purchase the exam.\n\n109\n00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:46,300\nYou log in as your account, and you put\nin your code, and once you've done that\n\n110\n00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:52,250\nyou buy the exam for $65, and then\nyou'll have 48 hours to take the exam.\n\n111\n00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:55,850\nAt some point in the next 48 hours\nyou need to log in to the website and\n\n112\n00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:56,580\ntake the exam.\n\n113\n00:05:56,580 --> 00:06:00,200\nRight there, from the comfort of your\nown home move through it and go.\n\n114\n00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,510\nIt's a really honest exam.\n\n115\n00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:07,110\nSome exams get really trick questions, and\nquestions outside of the course material.\n\n116\n00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:08,900\nThis one is really straight forward.\n\n117\n00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,680\nThe questions do come\nright out of this book.\n\n118\n00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,780\nSo if you've read the book, if you've\ndone the labs, you've done the exercises,\n\n119\n00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:17,060\nyou understand the concept,\nyou won't have a problem passing the exam.\n\n120\n00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:22,400\nNow, to show you that code, I'm just\ngonna go to Pearson's main page here.\n\n121\n00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,685\nAnd when we go to their page, and\nwe want to get information about a test,\n\n122\n00:06:26,685 --> 00:06:31,063\nwe can go to this Test Taker's Services,\nand we can go in here and pick IT.\n\n123\n00:06:31,063 --> 00:06:35,093\nAnd you will see Apple has two\ndivisions in here, Apple IT and\n\n124\n00:06:35,093 --> 00:06:37,530\npro apps as well as AppleCare.\n\n125\n00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:40,490\nAppleCare that is for\nthe people seeking to do warranty work for\n\n126\n00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:42,510\nApple, warranty hardware repair.\n\n127\n00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:44,560\nThat's not what we're doing,\nso we'll go to Apple IT,\n\n128\n00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,200\nand when you go in here you'll\nsee information about the exams.\n\n129\n00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:52,480\nAnd you can go in and\nactually sign up, to take an exam.\n\n130\n00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,700\nAnd if you go through,\n\n131\n00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:57,500\nwhen you go to sign up, you'll see a blank\nto punch in the code for that exam.\n\n132\n00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:01,440\nSo let's see, I don't necessarily\nwant to sign in with my account,\n\n133\n00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,520\nlet me see if it will,\nlet me do it from here.\n\n134\n00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,570\nIt's gonna make me sign in.\n\n135\n00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:07,670\nWell anyhow, once you sign in,\n\n136\n00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:10,580\nyou go to purchase exam,\njust remember to put in that code.\n\n137\n00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:14,400\nYou'll see the exam listed even if,\nyou don't put in the code.\n\n138\n00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:18,495\nThe exam that's listed by default,\nthat's the one that requires you to go to\n\n139\n00:07:18,495 --> 00:07:21,082\nan Apple Authorized Training Center,\nan AATC.\n\n140\n00:07:21,082 --> 00:07:24,330\nYou'll have to physically go to\nthe center to take the exam.\n\n141\n00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:28,060\nBut when you put in\nthe code the exam changes.\n\n142\n00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:31,560\nThe exam changes and it now is the one\nthat'll be able to be taken online.\n\n143\n00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:34,370\nSo that it is really\nimportant that you do that,\n\n144\n00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:37,740\nto make sure that you go in and\nget that chance.\n\n145\n00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:42,760\nAnd I wanted to show you that because\nthe exam number, I just wanted to\n\n146\n00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:46,190\nget information of about the exam without\nlogging in, apparently its gonna make me.\n\n147\n00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:49,560\nBut the exam number is\nlisted there on the site,\n\n148\n00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:53,800\nI can't remember it off hand its\nlike 4L0-109 or something like that.\n\n149\n00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:57,535\nAnd when you put in the code\nthe exam number changes and\n\n150\n00:07:57,535 --> 00:08:00,545\nit adds NP to the end of the number.\n\n151\n00:08:00,545 --> 00:08:04,215\nAnd that means non proctored in other\nwords your not going to the center.\n\n152\n00:08:04,215 --> 00:08:06,545\nSo make sure you do that, once you do it,\n\n153\n00:08:06,545 --> 00:08:10,507\nyou now have access to the online exam,\nthey give you two hours.\n\n154\n00:08:10,507 --> 00:08:14,967\nSo 45 questions over two hours,\nwhich is plenty of time.\n\n155\n00:08:14,967 --> 00:08:18,087\nI think most people say\nthey finish under one hour.\n\n156\n00:08:18,087 --> 00:08:22,137\nSo it's not a high pressure exam, you\ncan take your time and move through it.\n\n157\n00:08:22,137 --> 00:08:24,307\nSo that's definitely a good thing.\n\n158\n00:08:24,307 --> 00:08:27,647\nOnce you're through it, you get your\nresults right at the end of the exam.\n\n159\n00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:29,520\nSo you'll know if you passed or failed.\n\n160\n00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,310\nYou get a pass if you get\n80% of the questions right.\n\n161\n00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:34,020\nSo that's not bad.\n\n162\n00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:37,510\nFour out of five questions you\ngotta get right out of your 45.\n\n163\n00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:41,910\nNow, there are five questions\non the exam that are not scored.\n\n164\n00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:45,160\nThat means that Apple is basically\nputting in a couple of questions that\n\n165\n00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,040\nthey're not sure are ready for prime time.\n\n166\n00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,640\nThey're kind of testing them out to see,\nhow it goes?\n\n167\n00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:52,900\nSo those questions, they look at\nyour results to determine whether or\n\n168\n00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:55,990\nnot they should incorporate those\nas real questions later on, but for\n\n169\n00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:57,300\nyour exam the won't be scored.\n\n170\n00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:00,600\nNow, I tell you that,\nbecause you'll see a message about it,\n\n171\n00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,200\nwhen you go to take the exam.\n\n172\n00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:05,580\nBut don't worry about it,\nbecause you don't know\n\n173\n00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:08,670\nwhich five questions are not scored,\nthey don't tell you.\n\n174\n00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:11,110\nSo just treat it like a 45 question exam.\n\n175\n00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:13,790\nDon't try and figure out which ones\nare not scored, cuz you can't.\n\n176\n00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:18,484\nSo just go through,\ntake your 45 questions and pass the exam.\n\n177\n00:09:18,484 --> 00:09:20,300\nAn 80% will get you a pass.\n\n178\n00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:24,130\nMost of the questions are multiple choice,\nso your just picking an answer.\n\n179\n00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:28,390\nSome are choose all that apply, so you'll\nhave to check off various options there's\n\n180\n00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:31,770\nmore than one answer and\nthen others are picture questions.\n\n181\n00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:33,640\nI love the picture questions\nit'll show you a picture,\n\n182\n00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:37,790\nand it'll say things like, where would\nyou click to perform this activity?\n\n183\n00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:40,250\nAnd so you just select, where on\nthe screen you would click to go and\n\n184\n00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:41,710\nperform that activity.\n\n185\n00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:43,140\nLike I said, really straight forward.\n\n186\n00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:44,140\nI do like these exams.\n\n187\n00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:49,240\nAll right, so that's a little bit about\nthe Apple Certified Associate Exam.\n\n188\n00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,350\nAnd how we take it and\nhow we get the certification?\n\n189\n00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:54,720\nNow, who would be a good candidate\nto take this certification?\n\n190\n00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,400\nWell, just about anybody.\n\n191\n00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:00,750\nIf you're working in an IT environment and\nyou support Macintosh PCs and\n\n192\n00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:04,030\nLaptops, then this is a great\ncertification for you.\n\n193\n00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:09,370\nIf you're a Windows admin, and you're\nlooking to start supporting Apple stuff,\n\n194\n00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:11,490\nthis is a great certification for you.\n\n195\n00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:15,710\nIf you just a home user, and you want to\nlearn a little bit more about the advanced\n\n196\n00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:19,530\nfunctionality of having more then one Mac,\nthis is a great certification for you.\n\n197\n00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:22,300\nBut if your just a home user with one\nmachine or you're a business user with\n\n198\n00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:26,150\njust one machine, it's not necessarily\nthe greatest certification for\n\n199\n00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:28,700\nyou, cuz it is all about\nintegrating with other systems.\n\n200\n00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:32,680\nSo that is really the key component,\nanybody who is supporting more than one\n\n201\n00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:37,559\nPC, were one of the PCs is running Mac OS\nthen you're gonna benefit from this exam.\n\n202\n00:10:37,559 --> 00:10:41,580\nSo definitely a great one,\nI hope to see you guys in this show.\n\n203\n00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:44,940\nIf you're gonna take the exam,\nbest of luck to you.\n\n204\n00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:48,730\nAlways keep in mind that with us, you\nget our shows where we cover the exams.\n\n205\n00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:51,410\nSo we'll go over all these topics\nin each of our episodes, but\n\n206\n00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:52,880\nyou also have the Q and A forum.\n\n207\n00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,040\nSo if you have any questions on\nthe material as you go through it,\n\n208\n00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,550\nmake sure that you reach out to us

Integration episodes coming up soon.\n\n214\n00:11:08,779 --> 00:11:14,442\n[MUSIC]\n\n",
