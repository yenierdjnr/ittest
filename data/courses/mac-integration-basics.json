          "transcript": "1\n00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,102\n[MUSIC]\n\n2\n00:00:08,102 --> 00:00:12,159\nSo I want to take a moment to talk about\nthe Apple Certified Associates and\n\n3\n00:00:12,159 --> 00:00:14,886\nparticularly the Mac\nIntegration Basics Exam,\n\n4\n00:00:14,886 --> 00:00:19,825\nthat we can take to obtain the Apple\nCertified Associate Certification.\n\n5\n00:00:19,825 --> 00:00:22,775\nFirst off, the ACA,\nthe Apple Certified Associate,\n\n6\n00:00:22,775 --> 00:00:24,990\nwe'll see how many times\nI can say it in a minute.\n\n7\n00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:29,392\n[LAUGH] So the ACA it's an entry\nlevel certification with Apple\n\n8\n00:00:29,392 --> 00:00:34,112\nthat shows that you have or\nthe tester has a basic understanding of\n\n9\n00:00:34,112 --> 00:00:38,792\nhow to use Mac OS in a corporate or\nenterprise environment.\n\n10\n00:00:38,792 --> 00:00:42,612\nThere's two versions of this,\nthe Mac Management Basics,\n\n11\n00:00:42,612 --> 00:00:46,640\nwhich we cover in another show, and\nthis one the Mac Integration Basics.\n\n12\n00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:51,630\nWith Mac Integration we're looking\nat topics that surround using a Mac,\n\n13\n00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:55,075\na machine specifically\nrunning OS X Mavericks or\n\n14\n00:00:55,075 --> 00:00:58,130\nOS 10 Mavericks in\na corporate environment.\n\n15\n00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:01,310\nSo an environment where you\nhave more than one Mac.\n\n16\n00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:04,240\nAnybody can fire up a Mac laptop or\ndesktop and get to work.\n\n17\n00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:06,960\nRight?\nUsing it by itself is really pretty easy.\n\n18\n00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,990\nBut when we start integrating, using the\nMac with other systems, there's a couple\n\n19\n00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:15,060\nof things that we need to be aware of, and\nthat's what this certification covers.\n\n20\n00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:18,530\nWe take a look at getting Macs to\nparticipate together on a network, so\n\n21\n00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:20,320\njust sharing files, printers,\n\n22\n00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:24,100\nother things like that between\nmultiple systems running Mac OS.\n\n23\n00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:28,340\nWe also take a look at integrating\nour systems with Windows machines,\n\n24\n00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:29,600\nbecause in a lot of corporate and\n\n25\n00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,780\nbusiness environments, you're going to\nhave Microsoft Windows pretty heavily.\n\n26\n00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:36,930\nI think it's something like 80% of\nthe business market share right now.\n\n27\n00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:41,810\nSo while you might be firmly entrenched\nin the Mac world, many people aren't.\n\n28\n00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:45,160\nAnd so we need to get our\nsystems playing nicely together.\n\n29\n00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,990\nSo we take a look at doing file\nsharing and sharing printers,\n\n30\n00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:51,090\nstuff like that, between a Mac and\na Windows machine.\n\n31\n00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:54,470\nAnd we'll look at how we can migrate,\nso maybe you're making the switch or\n\n32\n00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:57,430\nyou're getting rid of those Windows\nmachines, and you're moving over to Mac.\n\n33\n00:01:57,430 --> 00:02:00,870\nSo we'll take a look at how to bring\nour user data over, our settings,\n\n34\n00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:04,450\nour files, all that good stuff, and\nmake that transition a little bit easier.\n\n35\n00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:08,460\nBecause you know how it is with end users,\nthey're always resistant to change.\n\n36\n00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:11,630\nWe wanna make things as painless as\npossible to get them to move over.\n\n37\n00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:14,730\nSo those are some of the topics\nthat we take a look at,\n\n38\n00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:17,310\nas we go through this certification.\n\n39\n00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:20,890\nNow, let me talk just a little bit\nabout attaining this certification.\n\n40\n00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:23,680\nThe certification itself\nis pretty straight forward.\n\n41\n00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:28,180\nThis is one of the ones I really like,\nbecause it is so straight forward.\n\n42\n00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:32,430\nThe exam is a 50 question,\nI'm sorry a 45 question\n\n43\n00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:37,840\nexam that is based entirely\non the content from one book.\n\n44\n00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,780\nOne book that is made available for\nfree online.\n\n45\n00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:42,120\nThat's part of what makes this so awesome.\n\n46\n00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,190\nThis is an extremely low\ncost certification to get.\n\n47\n00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:46,030\nAnd for an entry level certification,\n\n48\n00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:47,660\nthere's absolutely no\nreason you shouldn't do it.\n\n49\n00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:49,640\nIt looks great on the resume.\n\n50\n00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,110\nSo where do we get that book?\n\n51\n00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:53,610\nWell, what we do is we\ngo to Apple's website.\n\n52\n00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:56,430\nAnd Apple has a website dedicated\nto their certifications,\n\n53\n00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:00,074\nit's training.apple.com/certification.\n\n54\n00:03:00,074 --> 00:03:01,910\nAnd if you jump over to that website,\n\n55\n00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:04,760\nyou'll see on there where they've got\ntheir creative certifications for\n\n56\n00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:09,400\nthe design professionals, and then the IT\nprofessionals, that's what we're doing.\n\n57\n00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,570\nThis is a Maverick certification, so\n\n58\n00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:16,030\nevery time a new version of Mac OS comes\nout they update the certifications.\n\n59\n00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:17,220\nIt's usually not right away.\n\n60\n00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:20,070\nSo for example at this time,\n\n61\n00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:23,080\nI know you guys are probably watching\nthis video later on in the future.\n\n62\n00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:27,804\nBut at this time they've announced\nMac OS Yosemite the next version which is\n\n63\n00:03:27,804 --> 00:03:28,899\ngoing to be 10.10.\n\n64\n00:03:28,899 --> 00:03:32,330\nBut the 10.10 certifications\nwon't come out until well\n\n65\n00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:34,710\nafter the OS is actually in our hands.\n\n66\n00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:36,990\nSo right now Mavericks\nis the most recent on,\n\n67\n00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:40,410\nand if you go into that\nMavericks certifications link.\n\n68\n00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:44,120\nYou'll see where they detail the four\ncertification exams that they\n\n69\n00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,520\nhave right now.\n\n70\n00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:49,130\nActually, it's five,\nit's a four certifications, five tests.\n\n71\n00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:53,880\nThe Apple certified associate, you'll see\nthere's two different ones listed here.\n\n72\n00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:56,020\nOne for Mac Management Basics, and one for\n\n73\n00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:59,360\nMac Integration Basics,\nthey're both very similar.\n\n74\n00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,100\nAnd see how it says,\nthat they're available online.\n\n75\n00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:06,240\nIf you want to pursue your Apple Certified\nAssociate, you just come in here.\n\n76\n00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,060\nAnd if you click on it,\n\n77\n00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:09,880\nyou'll see where they tell you what\nyou need to do to get certified.\n\n78\n00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,810\nYou need to take that exam,\nand here's the PDF.\n\n79\n00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:17,170\nYou can download this manual right here.\n\n80\n00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:18,720\nThis is the book.\n\n81\n00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,040\nIt's not very, very giant at all.\n\n82\n00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,630\nYou can sit down and read this over\nthe course of one or maybe two days and\n\n83\n00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:25,830\nget the material.\n\n84\n00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:28,570\nAll the test questions come\nright from this book, so\n\n85\n00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:30,040\nit's a great resource to have.\n\n86\n00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:34,060\nWe really don't need too much\nelse to get ready for the exam.\n\n87\n00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:36,580\nWhen you're ready to actually take\nthe exam, you'll see back here,\n\n88\n00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:38,090\nwhere it says available online.\n\n89\n00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:40,350\nI'm just gonna hit that\navailable online link.\n\n90\n00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:43,700\nAnd it takes you to a page and\ndescribes the exam itself.\n\n91\n00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:48,530\nSo it tells you it is $65, and\nthat you can take it through Pearson VUE.\n\n92\n00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:53,580\nPearson VUE is a company that does\ncertification exams all across the world.\n\n93\n00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:57,080\nThis is one of the special exams\nthough that you can take online.\n\n94\n00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,830\nYou don't actually have to go\nto a Pearson VUE Center or\n\n95\n00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:01,860\nto an Apple Authorized Training Center.\n\n96\n00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:04,650\nYou can, if you want,\nyou can go to an AATC.\n\n97\n00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:09,150\nBut if you're like me, the nearest\nAATC to me is two hours drive away.\n\n98\n00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:11,480\nI have to drive two hours\nto go take this exam.\n\n99\n00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,400\nBut you can take this one online.\n\n100\n00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:16,170\nIf you wanna do it online,\nnotice this code.\n\n101\n00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:19,990\nEnter MavOSX109, right there.\n\n102\n00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:23,830\nSo that code is what will allow you\nto take it online instead of going\n\n103\n00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:24,410\nto a center.\n\n104\n00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:28,050\nAnd it's right here on the webpage,\nso you just copy that code.\n\n105\n00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:32,340\nSo you've got it, if you can master\nthe copy the command here which,\n\n106\n00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:36,570\nI'm screwing up, and then we can jump\non over to Pearson's website, and\n\n107\n00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:38,290\nsign up to take the exam.\n\n108\n00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:41,100\nSo when you go here,\nyou'll be able to purchase the exam.\n\n109\n00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:46,300\nYou log in as your account, and you put\nin your code, and once you've done that\n\n110\n00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:52,250\nyou buy the exam for $65, and then\nyou'll have 48 hours to take the exam.\n\n111\n00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:55,850\nAt some point in the next 48 hours\nyou need to log in to the website and\n\n112\n00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:56,580\ntake the exam.\n\n113\n00:05:56,580 --> 00:06:00,200\nRight there, from the comfort of your\nown home move through it and go.\n\n114\n00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,510\nIt's a really honest exam.\n\n115\n00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:07,110\nSome exams get really trick questions, and\nquestions outside of the course material.\n\n116\n00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:08,900\nThis one is really straight forward.\n\n117\n00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,680\nThe questions do come\nright out of this book.\n\n118\n00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,780\nSo if you've read the book, if you've\ndone the labs, you've done the exercises,\n\n119\n00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:17,060\nyou understand the concept,\nyou won't have a problem passing the exam.\n\n120\n00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:22,400\nNow, to show you that code, I'm just\ngonna go to Pearson's main page here.\n\n121\n00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,685\nAnd when we go to their page, and\nwe want to get information about a test,\n\n122\n00:06:26,685 --> 00:06:31,063\nwe can go to this Test Taker's Services,\nand we can go in here and pick IT.\n\n123\n00:06:31,063 --> 00:06:35,093\nAnd you will see Apple has two\ndivisions in here, Apple IT and\n\n124\n00:06:35,093 --> 00:06:37,530\npro apps as well as AppleCare.\n\n125\n00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:40,490\nAppleCare that is for\nthe people seeking to do warranty work for\n\n126\n00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:42,510\nApple, warranty hardware repair.\n\n127\n00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:44,560\nThat's not what we're doing,\nso we'll go to Apple IT,\n\n128\n00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,200\nand when you go in here you'll\nsee information about the exams.\n\n129\n00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:52,480\nAnd you can go in and\nactually sign up, to take an exam.\n\n130\n00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,700\nAnd if you go through,\n\n131\n00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:57,500\nwhen you go to sign up, you'll see a blank\nto punch in the code for that exam.\n\n132\n00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:01,440\nSo let's see, I don't necessarily\nwant to sign in with my account,\n\n133\n00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,520\nlet me see if it will,\nlet me do it from here.\n\n134\n00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,570\nIt's gonna make me sign in.\n\n135\n00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:07,670\nWell anyhow, once you sign in,\n\n136\n00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:10,580\nyou go to purchase exam,\njust remember to put in that code.\n\n137\n00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:14,400\nYou'll see the exam listed even if,\nyou don't put in the code.\n\n138\n00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:18,495\nThe exam that's listed by default,\nthat's the one that requires you to go to\n\n139\n00:07:18,495 --> 00:07:21,082\nan Apple Authorized Training Center,\nan AATC.\n\n140\n00:07:21,082 --> 00:07:24,330\nYou'll have to physically go to\nthe center to take the exam.\n\n141\n00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:28,060\nBut when you put in\nthe code the exam changes.\n\n142\n00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:31,560\nThe exam changes and it now is the one\nthat'll be able to be taken online.\n\n143\n00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:34,370\nSo that it is really\nimportant that you do that,\n\n144\n00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:37,740\nto make sure that you go in and\nget that chance.\n\n145\n00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:42,760\nAnd I wanted to show you that because\nthe exam number, I just wanted to\n\n146\n00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:46,190\nget information of about the exam without\nlogging in, apparently its gonna make me.\n\n147\n00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:49,560\nBut the exam number is\nlisted there on the site,\n\n148\n00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:53,800\nI can't remember it off hand its\nlike 4L0-109 or something like that.\n\n149\n00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:57,535\nAnd when you put in the code\nthe exam number changes and\n\n150\n00:07:57,535 --> 00:08:00,545\nit adds NP to the end of the number.\n\n151\n00:08:00,545 --> 00:08:04,215\nAnd that means non proctored in other\nwords your not going to the center.\n\n152\n00:08:04,215 --> 00:08:06,545\nSo make sure you do that, once you do it,\n\n153\n00:08:06,545 --> 00:08:10,507\nyou now have access to the online exam,\nthey give you two hours.\n\n154\n00:08:10,507 --> 00:08:14,967\nSo 45 questions over two hours,\nwhich is plenty of time.\n\n155\n00:08:14,967 --> 00:08:18,087\nI think most people say\nthey finish under one hour.\n\n156\n00:08:18,087 --> 00:08:22,137\nSo it's not a high pressure exam, you\ncan take your time and move through it.\n\n157\n00:08:22,137 --> 00:08:24,307\nSo that's definitely a good thing.\n\n158\n00:08:24,307 --> 00:08:27,647\nOnce you're through it, you get your\nresults right at the end of the exam.\n\n159\n00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:29,520\nSo you'll know if you passed or failed.\n\n160\n00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,310\nYou get a pass if you get\n80% of the questions right.\n\n161\n00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:34,020\nSo that's not bad.\n\n162\n00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:37,510\nFour out of five questions you\ngotta get right out of your 45.\n\n163\n00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:41,910\nNow, there are five questions\non the exam that are not scored.\n\n164\n00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:45,160\nThat means that Apple is basically\nputting in a couple of questions that\n\n165\n00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,040\nthey're not sure are ready for prime time.\n\n166\n00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,640\nThey're kind of testing them out to see,\nhow it goes?\n\n167\n00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:52,900\nSo those questions, they look at\nyour results to determine whether or\n\n168\n00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:55,990\nnot they should incorporate those\nas real questions later on, but for\n\n169\n00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:57,300\nyour exam the won't be scored.\n\n170\n00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:00,600\nNow, I tell you that,\nbecause you'll see a message about it,\n\n171\n00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,200\nwhen you go to take the exam.\n\n172\n00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:05,580\nBut don't worry about it,\nbecause you don't know\n\n173\n00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:08,670\nwhich five questions are not scored,\nthey don't tell you.\n\n174\n00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:11,110\nSo just treat it like a 45 question exam.\n\n175\n00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:13,790\nDon't try and figure out which ones\nare not scored, cuz you can't.\n\n176\n00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:18,484\nSo just go through,\ntake your 45 questions and pass the exam.\n\n177\n00:09:18,484 --> 00:09:20,300\nAn 80% will get you a pass.\n\n178\n00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:24,130\nMost of the questions are multiple choice,\nso your just picking an answer.\n\n179\n00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:28,390\nSome are choose all that apply, so you'll\nhave to check off various options there's\n\n180\n00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:31,770\nmore than one answer and\nthen others are picture questions.\n\n181\n00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:33,640\nI love the picture questions\nit'll show you a picture,\n\n182\n00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:37,790\nand it'll say things like, where would\nyou click to perform this activity?\n\n183\n00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:40,250\nAnd so you just select, where on\nthe screen you would click to go and\n\n184\n00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:41,710\nperform that activity.\n\n185\n00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:43,140\nLike I said, really straight forward.\n\n186\n00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:44,140\nI do like these exams.\n\n187\n00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:49,240\nAll right, so that's a little bit about\nthe Apple Certified Associate Exam.\n\n188\n00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,350\nAnd how we take it and\nhow we get the certification?\n\n189\n00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:54,720\nNow, who would be a good candidate\nto take this certification?\n\n190\n00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,400\nWell, just about anybody.\n\n191\n00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:00,750\nIf you're working in an IT environment and\nyou support Macintosh PCs and\n\n192\n00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:04,030\nLaptops, then this is a great\ncertification for you.\n\n193\n00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:09,370\nIf you're a Windows admin, and you're\nlooking to start supporting Apple stuff,\n\n194\n00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:11,490\nthis is a great certification for you.\n\n195\n00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:15,710\nIf you just a home user, and you want to\nlearn a little bit more about the advanced\n\n196\n00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:19,530\nfunctionality of having more then one Mac,\nthis is a great certification for you.\n\n197\n00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:22,300\nBut if your just a home user with one\nmachine or you're a business user with\n\n198\n00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:26,150\njust one machine, it's not necessarily\nthe greatest certification for\n\n199\n00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:28,700\nyou, cuz it is all about\nintegrating with other systems.\n\n200\n00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:32,680\nSo that is really the key component,\nanybody who is supporting more than one\n\n201\n00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:37,559\nPC, were one of the PCs is running Mac OS\nthen you're gonna benefit from this exam.\n\n202\n00:10:37,559 --> 00:10:41,580\nSo definitely a great one,\nI hope to see you guys in this show.\n\n203\n00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:44,940\nIf you're gonna take the exam,\nbest of luck to you.\n\n204\n00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:48,730\nAlways keep in mind that with us, you\nget our shows where we cover the exams.\n\n205\n00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:51,410\nSo we'll go over all these topics\nin each of our episodes, but\n\n206\n00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:52,880\nyou also have the Q and A forum.\n\n207\n00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,040\nSo if you have any questions on\nthe material as you go through it,\n\n208\n00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,550\nmake sure that you reach out to us and\nask.\n\n209\n00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:59,790\nWe definitely want to help and\nmake sure you're ready for\n\n210\n00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:01,480\nthat exam when you go and take it.\n\n211\n00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,140\nAll right.\n\n212\n00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:04,090\nSo I hope to see you then.\n\n213\n00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:08,779\nStay tuned, because we've got more\nMac Integration episodes coming up soon.\n\n214\n00:11:08,779 --> 00:11:14,442\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

and welcome back\nto another episode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:38,851 --> 00:00:40,571\nI'm your host Don Pizet.\n\n5\n00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:44,950\nToday jumping into Mac Integration Basics.\n\n6\n00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:47,142\nSo this is a new show for us.\n\n7\n00:00:47,142 --> 00:00:49,880\nWell we've done an Apple\ncertified associate show already.\n\n8\n00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,320\nWe did the Mac management basics but\n\n9\n00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:55,020\nthis is the first episode\nof Mac Integration Basics.\n\n10\n00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:59,000\nSo we're gonna be jumping in to a lot\nof neat topics as we take a look at\n\n11\n00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,020\nhow to get our Macs to play\nnice in a network environment.\n\n12\n00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:03,970\nIt's not very hard.\n\n13\n00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:05,250\nRight?\n\n14\n00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:10,435\nUnder the hood of OS 10,\nwe have BSD, the UNIX-like operating\n\n15\n00:01:10,435 --> 00:01:14,515\nsystem which was developed as a network\noperating system from the very beginning.\n\n16\n00:01:14,515 --> 00:01:18,695\nSo you've got over 30 years\nof networking technology\n\n17\n00:01:18,695 --> 00:01:21,495\nunder the hood on an Apple system.\n\n18\n00:01:21,495 --> 00:01:25,870\nSo it makes sense that it's gonna\nplay nice in a network environment.\n\n19\n00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:27,690\nBut a lot of those features\nare not played up.\n\n20\n00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:31,870\nA lot of the features inside of Mac OS\nare kind of hidden away behind the scenes,\n\n21\n00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:34,860\nbecause your average home\nuser doesn't need them.\n\n22\n00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:38,800\nA lot of the operating system is\ntweaked more towards a home user.\n\n23\n00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,360\nBut as a network admin,\n\n24\n00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:43,660\nall we have to do is just go in and\nset a couple of little values.\n\n25\n00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:46,460\nAnd all of a sudden, we've got a very\npowerful network operating system,\n\n26\n00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:48,990\nit's all there just waiting for\nus to turn it on.\n\n27\n00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:51,120\nSo that's what we're gonna take a look at.\n\n28\n00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:54,560\nNow, one of the big problems we\nhave in network environments,\n\n29\n00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,980\nwhen you have more than one computer on\nthe network, when they access each other,\n\n30\n00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:01,540\nwe have to do it in\na method that is secure.\n\n31\n00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:05,050\nAnd by secure I mean we don't wanna just\nmake it where anybody on the network can\n\n32\n00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:06,490\nsee our stuff.\n\n33\n00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:09,940\nBecause then if you took\nyour laptop to Starbucks and\n\n34\n00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:13,150\nyou went in the Starbucks and you jumped\non their wireless to get on the Internet.\n\n35\n00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:16,270\nWell, what about all the other customers\nthat are on the wireless there also.\n\n36\n00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:19,010\nThey'd be able to see your files and\nyour information.\n\n37\n00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:22,720\nSo we need ways to make sure\nthat things are secure.\n\n38\n00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,830\nAnd the easiest way to do that is\nthrough requiring authentication,\n\n39\n00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:28,280\nrequiring a username and a password.\n\n40\n00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:31,960\nSo I'll make my folders available on\nthe network to the other machines.\n\n41\n00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:34,812\nAs long as they have a valid username and\npassword on my machine.\n\n42\n00:02:34,812 --> 00:02:35,690\nAll right.\n\n43\n00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:39,150\nWell, if you have two computers,\nthat's not a big deal.\n\n44\n00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:42,370\nYou create user accounts on the individual\nmachines and you're ready to rock.\n\n45\n00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:46,650\nIf you have three computers, or four\ncomputers, again, you can go around and\n\n46\n00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:49,670\ncreate accounts on the individual\nmachines and you'll be fine.\n\n47\n00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:52,100\nBut what if we have 3,000 computers?\n\n48\n00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:54,710\nWell, you don't want to go to each and\n\n49\n00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:56,910\nevery one of those machines\nto add an account.\n\n50\n00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:58,340\nSo you hire a new employee.\n\n51\n00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:02,230\nYou don't wanna go and add that\nemployee's account on 3,000 machines.\n\n52\n00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:05,900\nSo in a network environment,\nit's very common for\n\n53\n00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:09,060\nus to use a centralized user database.\n\n54\n00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:13,440\nInstead of having user accounts on\neach and every individual machine.\n\n55\n00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,780\nWe maintain a centralized\ndatabase somewhere on our network\n\n56\n00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,890\nthat has all of our user accounts.\n\n57\n00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:21,340\nAnd that way when we add a new employee,\n\n58\n00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:26,610\nwe just add them to that central database\nand the other 3,000 machines just see it.\n\n59\n00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:28,510\nAnd then if an employee gets terminated or\n\n60\n00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:32,120\nleaves the company, we just go and cancel\ntheir account in that central database.\n\n61\n00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:35,110\nAnd the other 3,000 machines see it,\nand that's it.\n\n62\n00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:35,630\nRight?\n\n63\n00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:39,950\nSo, a centralized user database\nis pretty important, and\n\n64\n00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:44,590\nif you've got a network that is four\ncomputers, you might not worry about it.\n\n65\n00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:47,430\nIf it's a small network you\nmight just manage it by hand.\n\n66\n00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:50,340\nBut as your network grows, even when\nyou're just at like ten computers,\n\n67\n00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:54,980\nit becomes a bit of a hassle to manage\nwithout that centralized database.\n\n68\n00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:58,770\nWell, OS 10,\nby default when you boot up Mac OS,\n\n69\n00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:01,615\nit's expecting a user account\nright on your own machine.\n\n70\n00:04:01,615 --> 00:04:03,510\nRight?\nLet me show you what I'm talking about.\n\n71\n00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:06,592\nSo on this machine if I log out.\n\n72\n00:04:06,592 --> 00:04:08,740\nAll right.\n\n73\n00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:12,210\nWhen I sit down at this machine and I go\nto log in, I see a screen like this and\n\n74\n00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:15,160\nI'll see little bubbles\nhere that are reflecting\n\n75\n00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,660\nwhat user accounts I can log in.\n\n76\n00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:19,460\nAs of now I've only got\none called Help Desk, and\n\n77\n00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:24,210\nI can log in and, but if I can\nremember the password, I can login.\n\n78\n00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:26,490\n[LAUGH] I might have to call\nthe Help Desk, there we go.\n\n79\n00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:28,710\nAnd we can get in there and\nuse the machine.\n\n80\n00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:31,100\nThis is what's called a local account,\n\n81\n00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:35,930\nlocal accounts are defined in\nsystem preferences, jump in here.\n\n82\n00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:39,390\nWe have the users and\ngroup system preference.\n\n83\n00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:41,380\nAnd here's our local accounts.\n\n84\n00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:43,580\nRight?\nThese are local accounts that are right\n\n85\n00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:47,400\nhere on this one machine and that's it.\n\n86\n00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,610\nSo if I have three other Macs,\n\n87\n00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:52,810\nif I created a user account right here\nthe other three macs don't know about it.\n\n88\n00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:54,110\nThey don't see it.\n\n89\n00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:56,200\nSo I've got this Help Desk account.\n\n90\n00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:59,590\nAnd if I go in here and, well I'm\ngonna unlock so I have permission.\n\n91\n00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,860\nI can add in a new user account.\n\n92\n00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:08,570\nAnd I can create a administrator\nwhich has full access to my system.\n\n93\n00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:13,370\nOr just a standard, regular,\nold user or a child account.\n\n94\n00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:14,790\nRight?\nAn account that's managed by\n\n95\n00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:18,490\nparental controls or\nI could create one for sharing only.\n\n96\n00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:21,760\nWe'll talk about that in episode two,\nwhen we start Sharing Folders.\n\n97\n00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:24,224\nOr I could create a group of users,\nif I wanted.\n\n98\n00:05:24,224 --> 00:05:26,360\nI'm gonna create standard user for myself.\n\n99\n00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,490\nRight?\nSo I'm just gonna create\n\n100\n00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:30,840\na Don Pezet account, and\nI'll set my password.\n\n101\n00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,530\nAll right.\n\n102\n00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:35,530\nAnd so I just created an account for\nmyself.\n\n103\n00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:37,130\nThere I am, Don Pezet.\n\n104\n00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:42,980\nNow, once that account is created,\nit's right here on this machine.\n\n105\n00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:47,750\nIf I go into my system preferences and\nI go back into users and\n\n106\n00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:50,390\ngroups, I'll see that\nDon Pezet account there.\n\n107\n00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:56,630\nAnd if I log out, I'll see a new bubble\non the log in screen for Don Pizet.\n\n108\n00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:59,000\nSo, I can log in as Don Pizet or\nHelp Desk.\n\n109\n00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,686\nThose are local accounts.\n\n110\n00:05:59,686 --> 00:06:00,300\nAll right.\n\n111\n00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:03,300\nBut, I've got another machine right here.\n\n112\n00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:06,820\nAnd, if I log out of it, so\nI'm just gonna log out of this one.\n\n113\n00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:12,770\nAnd notice,\nI don't have a Don Pezet bubble here.\n\n114\n00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:13,330\nRight?\n\n115\n00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:17,869\nAnd if I log into the machine and\nI go into its system preferences.\n\n116\n00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,850\nAnd go into its users and groups.\n\n117\n00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:25,400\nI'll see that there's no\nDon Pezet here either.\n\n118\n00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:30,320\nAnd that's because each Mac maintains\nit's own user database separate.\n\n119\n00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,470\nSeparate from everybody else.\n\n120\n00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:37,100\nAnd that's fine but if we have a lot of\ncomputers it becomes difficult to manage.\n\n121\n00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:39,920\nI don't want to have to go\nto each machine to add this.\n\n122\n00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:43,690\nSo instead,\nwe can use a centralized database and\n\n123\n00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:46,950\nMac OS supports two right out of the box.\n\n124\n00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:49,050\nThe first is called open directory and\n\n125\n00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:50,810\nthat's the one we're gonna take\na look at here in the beginning.\n\n126\n00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:55,370\nOpen Directory is a product from,\nI'm gonna say from Apple.\n\n127\n00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:56,620\nThey didn't develop it entirely.\n\n128\n00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:59,890\nIt's based on an open LDAP,\nwhich is an open source initiative.\n\n129\n00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:02,270\nA lot of different operating\nsystems out there support it.\n\n130\n00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:07,680\nSo it's a very mature and accepted\nsolution for centralized databases.\n\n131\n00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,160\nThe other solution it supports is\nwhat's called the Active Directory and\n\n132\n00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,580\nthat's Microsoft's product.\n\n133\n00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:14,780\nMicrosoft Windows uses or\n\n134\n00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:18,200\ncan use the Active Directory\nas it's centralized database.\n\n135\n00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:22,580\nThe Active Directory has been around for\ngee, I don't know.\n\n136\n00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:23,600\n20 something odd years?\n\n137\n00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,110\nOh no, not 20 probably about 15 years now.\n\n138\n00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:27,900\nAnd It's been out for\n\n139\n00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:30,540\na while and it's very heavily\nused in a Windows environment.\n\n140\n00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:34,570\nNow, you might ask yourself, what do I\ncare about Windows, I'm using a Mac.\n\n141\n00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:38,420\nAnd the thing is,\nin corporate environments and business and\n\n142\n00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:43,190\nenterprise environments, Microsoft has\nsome 80% of the market shares still.\n\n143\n00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:46,222\nAnd so you're going to frequently\nsee Microsoft Solutions out their in\n\n144\n00:07:46,222 --> 00:07:47,800\nthe business and enterprise world.\n\n145\n00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:52,200\nSo You might have an all Mac household or\nyou might have an all Mac small business,\n\n146\n00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:55,695\nbut when you start getting into\nlarger business it is very rare to\n\n147\n00:07:55,695 --> 00:07:57,590\nfind an all Apple large business.\n\n148\n00:07:57,590 --> 00:08:00,460\nSo we need to have some kind of\nintegration there to support it.\n\n149\n00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:03,660\nAnd so Apple has support,\nfor Active Directory.\n\n150\n00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:04,860\nThose are our two choices.\n\n151\n00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:08,410\nOpen Directory, which is the Apple path,\nor Active Directory,\n\n152\n00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:09,890\nwhich is the Microsoft path.\n\n153\n00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:13,730\nAnd you pick, you can actually do both\nif you want, it's kind of a mess but\n\n154\n00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:16,080\nyou normally want to pick one or\nthe other.\n\n155\n00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,890\nIf you do both, you've lost\nthe benefit of having centralization.\n\n156\n00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:22,030\nNow when you add a user account\nyou've got to add to both and\n\n157\n00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:23,580\nit kind of defeats the purpose.\n\n158\n00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:28,720\nCorporations, companies they're usually\ngoing to pick one or the other.\n\n159\n00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:33,150\nLet's take a look at Open Directory first\nif you've never heard of Open Directory,\n\n160\n00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:36,660\ngetting it configured is a little bit\nbeyond the scope of this certification,\n\n161\n00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:38,350\nbut it's really not hard.\n\n162\n00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:43,460\nAll you do is, somewhere on your network,\nyou set up a Mac OS server.\n\n163\n00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:44,990\nNow a Mac OS server is not a big deal.\n\n164\n00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:48,760\nYou just go in your App Store and\nyou buy the server app.\n\n165\n00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:53,650\nSo if I go into my app store\nhere on this machine and\n\n166\n00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:58,450\nI just do a search for Mac server, or\nI just did a search for server app.\n\n167\n00:08:58,450 --> 00:08:59,560\nIt normally comes up.\n\n168\n00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,550\nThere it is.\n\n169\n00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:02,850\nThere's my OS X server.\n\n170\n00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:06,250\nAnd I can click on that and\ninstall that application.\n\n171\n00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:08,795\nAnd if you haven't bought it already,\nit costs $20 or $18.99.\n\n172\n00:09:08,795 --> 00:09:11,815\nSo you purchase that app and\nyou install it.\n\n173\n00:09:11,815 --> 00:09:12,895\nAnd now you got a server.\n\n174\n00:09:13,905 --> 00:09:17,745\nNow the server provides all sorts of\nfeatures that you may or may not use.\n\n175\n00:09:17,745 --> 00:09:18,965\nYou can set up a Website.\n\n176\n00:09:18,965 --> 00:09:20,035\nYou have a Wiki.\n\n177\n00:09:20,035 --> 00:09:24,055\nYou can set up Messaging, Mail,\nCalendar, all sorts of crazy stuff.\n\n178\n00:09:24,055 --> 00:09:24,805\nAll right.\n\n179\n00:09:24,805 --> 00:09:28,435\nBut the feature that I'm concerned\nabout is the Open Directory.\n\n180\n00:09:28,435 --> 00:09:31,386\nWhen you install the server app.\n\n181\n00:09:33,348 --> 00:09:37,979\nYou can fire it up, and in its Advanced\nsection, we'll see the Open Directory.\n\n182\n00:09:37,979 --> 00:09:41,480\nIt's not in the normal section, so\nyou'll kinda have to dig a little bit.\n\n183\n00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,020\nLet me just get into mine here.\n\n184\n00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:46,520\nSo when you first launch it,\nthis is what you'll see.\n\n185\n00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:50,070\nHere's the services, and you'll see\nCalendar, Contacts, Mail, Messages,\n\n186\n00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:51,630\nall that other good stuff.\n\n187\n00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:53,460\nBut down here under Advanced.\n\n188\n00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:57,860\nIf you hit show,\nyou'll see the Open Directory right there.\n\n189\n00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:00,710\nAnd you can set up\nan Open Directory server.\n\n190\n00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:03,805\nA centralized user database.\n\n191\n00:10:03,805 --> 00:10:07,145\nAll you do is flip the on switch and\nit'll run you through a little\n\n192\n00:10:07,145 --> 00:10:10,885\nwizard where it'll ask you what you\nwant to name your Open Directory and\n\n193\n00:10:10,885 --> 00:10:13,215\nyou can see mine,\nI didn't change the name.\n\n194\n00:10:13,215 --> 00:10:14,445\nI just called it what my server is.\n\n195\n00:10:14,445 --> 00:10:16,783\nMy server is OSX-Server1.\n\n196\n00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:20,765\nI see osx-server1.local\nis the master server and\n\n197\n00:10:20,765 --> 00:10:24,265\nI didn't give it any special name or\nanything like that, just turned it on.\n\n198\n00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:27,350\nRight?\nOnce it's on,\n\n199\n00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:31,030\nyou can go up here to Users and Groups.\n\n200\n00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:36,530\nAnd when you go under Users, you'll now\nhave two types of users you can create.\n\n201\n00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:42,630\nLocal users, those are users right here\non this Mac, and local network users.\n\n202\n00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:46,350\nBoth the network users are ones\nthat are stored in Open Directory.\n\n203\n00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:49,660\nThat's that centralized database that's\ngonna be shared among to our machine.\n\n204\n00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:54,070\nAnd you'll see I've created a bunch\nof local network users here.\n\n205\n00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:56,700\nStudent one two three,\nteacher one two three.\n\n206\n00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:59,980\nThey're right here stored\nin Open Directory.\n\n207\n00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:03,270\nIf I switch that to just local users\nI'll see there's my help desk account.\n\n208\n00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:05,400\nThat's just a local\naccount that I created.\n\n209\n00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:09,570\nIt's not in the Open Directory,\nor you can choose all and\n\n210\n00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:11,560\nyou'll see a mixture of them.\n\n211\n00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:15,270\nYou'll see and if you add one,\nso if I go and add a new user.\n\n212\n00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:20,320\nI need to change this to network first\nto make sure I'm adding a network user.\n\n213\n00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,110\nWhen we add a new user you\njust give them a name.\n\n214\n00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:24,990\nYou specify their basic information and\nit creates them and\n\n215\n00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:26,725\npops them into the Open Directory.\n\n216\n00:11:29,076 --> 00:11:32,836\nNow once we've got our users\nin the Open Directory,\n\n217\n00:11:32,836 --> 00:11:35,322\nhow does our client know to use it?\n\n218\n00:11:35,322 --> 00:11:39,575\nSo if I jump back to my client here, see\nit's got the local users in this list and\n\n219\n00:11:39,575 --> 00:11:40,290\nthat's it.\n\n220\n00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:44,700\nI don't see any information about\nlogging in via Open Directory.\n\n221\n00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:48,670\nWhat we need to do is\nwhat is called binding.\n\n222\n00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:53,370\nBinding is where we connect a client\nto that centralized user data base.\n\n223\n00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:55,640\nWhat you bind to a directory.\n\n224\n00:11:55,640 --> 00:12:00,270\nAnd OS 10 can support binding to\nActive Directory and Open Directory.\n\n225\n00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:01,980\nAnd it's actually done the same way.\n\n226\n00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:04,570\nSo let's take a look\nhere at Open Directory.\n\n227\n00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:06,553\nI'm gonna log back into this machine and\n\n228\n00:12:06,553 --> 00:12:08,897\nI'm gonna go back into\nmy system preferences.\n\n229\n00:12:12,685 --> 00:12:14,844\nAnd in my system preferences.\n\n230\n00:12:14,844 --> 00:12:17,415\nI'm going to go down here to Users and\nGroups.\n\n231\n00:12:17,415 --> 00:12:19,465\nIt was already there but\nI want to show the complete path.\n\n232\n00:12:19,465 --> 00:12:23,065\nI'm going into System Preferences and\nUsers and Groups.\n\n233\n00:12:23,065 --> 00:12:24,635\nHere's my Local Users.\n\n234\n00:12:26,305 --> 00:12:33,570\nBut, if we unlock you'll see this\nLogin Options button right here.\n\n235\n00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:36,380\nAnd if you choose Login Options, it'll\nshow some things like whether you wanna do\n\n236\n00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:38,490\nautomatic login and stuff like that.\n\n237\n00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:43,000\nBut down here at the bottom, Network\nAccount Server, and there's a Join button.\n\n238\n00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:46,800\nThis is what we use to\nbind to a directory.\n\n239\n00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,190\nI know it doesn't use the word bind there,\nbut I can guarantee you on the exam,\n\n240\n00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:51,220\nyou'll see that word bind.\n\n241\n00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:53,580\nSo make sure you remember it.\n\n242\n00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:55,190\nBut network account server.\n\n243\n00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:57,790\nWe're just saying, hey when I login.\n\n244\n00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:59,530\nWhere do my accounts come from?\n\n245\n00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:04,290\nBy default, they come right here from my\nLocal Users, but we can join a directory\n\n246\n00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:07,820\nand once it's found, then we can log\nin with accounts from there also.\n\n247\n00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:10,570\nYou can also still login as your\nlocal users if you want, or\n\n248\n00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:11,700\nyou can login with your network.\n\n249\n00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,590\nYou'll have both choices.\n\n250\n00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:17,720\nSo I'm going to go ahead and\nchoose to Join, and it's gonna ask me for\n\n251\n00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:20,190\nan Open Directory or\nActive Directory domain.\n\n252\n00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:25,410\nIf you're running Open Directory, a lot of\ntimes you'll just be able to hit the down\n\n253\n00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:27,550\narrow and it will find it on the network.\n\n254\n00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:30,440\nThat's one of the nice things about\nApple is Apple makes it easy, right?\n\n255\n00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,490\nWe can just search the network and\nfind it.\n\n256\n00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:35,460\nSo if you're running Open Directory\nit'll normally turn up pretty fast.\n\n257\n00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:36,370\nAll right.\n\n258\n00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:39,210\nWith Active Director we'll see\nlater it usually doesn't find it.\n\n259\n00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:40,460\nWe have to type it in.\n\n260\n00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:41,620\nSo you can go either way.\n\n261\n00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:45,090\nYou can type it in the name\nof the Open Directory master.\n\n262\n00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:47,410\nThe server you set up\nthe Open Directory on.\n\n263\n00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:49,220\nOr you can just browse\nto find it like this.\n\n264\n00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:50,750\nAnd so it found it for me.\n\n265\n00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:53,200\nI see osx-server1.local.\n\n266\n00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:53,700\nThere it is.\n\n267\n00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,170\nNow notice the spinning wheel.\n\n268\n00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:59,560\nIt's just kind of probing that server\nto make sure that it's actually there\n\n269\n00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,140\nand okay.\n\n270\n00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:02,180\nWe don't have to wait for\nit, I could've just hit OK.\n\n271\n00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:04,340\nIf you're not sure if\nthat's the right server,\n\n272\n00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:06,880\nyou can hit the Open Directory Utility.\n\n273\n00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,790\nBut since we're not bound yet, it's\ngonna have some authentication issues.\n\n274\n00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:13,590\nThe Open Directory Utility,\nit's utility that,\n\n275\n00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:18,280\nit lets you look into the database,\ninto that central user database, so\n\n276\n00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:21,120\nyou can see the various values and\nsettings that are inside of there.\n\n277\n00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,160\nMost users will never have\na need to go into that.\n\n278\n00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,390\nEven administrators, most administrators\nwill never have a need to go into that.\n\n279\n00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:29,820\nBut there may be some advanced\nsettings that you need to tweak and\n\n280\n00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:30,945\nyou can use that utility for.\n\n281\n00:14:32,511 --> 00:14:33,440\nI'm gonna go ahead and hit OK.\n\n282\n00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,940\nAnd now it's gonna go and\nbind to that server.\n\n283\n00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:39,180\nIt's reaching out to that open\ndirectory server and saying,\n\n284\n00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:40,720\nhey, we want to participate.\n\n285\n00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:46,040\nWell, it's got to negotiate some security\ninformation, so here I'm getting prompted.\n\n286\n00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:50,210\nIt's just letting me know that this server\ndoes not provide a secure SSL connection,\n\n287\n00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:51,850\ndo I want to continue.\n\n288\n00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:54,130\nWell, when I set up that\nserver on the other side,\n\n289\n00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:56,320\nI never did set up SSL certificates.\n\n290\n00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,360\nThis is a local network so\nI'm not too terribly worried about it.\n\n291\n00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:04,140\nIf I was pushing this over the internet,\nI'd either want to use SSL or\n\n292\n00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:07,800\nlike an IP SEC VPN or something of that\nnature to secure my communications.\n\n293\n00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,600\nIt's just giving me a little warning here.\n\n294\n00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,827\nI'm going to go ahead and hit continue.\n\n295\n00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:15,186\nAnd now it's gonna connect up and\nwe'll be bound.\n\n296\n00:15:15,186 --> 00:15:18,990\nYou see it's updating its search path.\n\n297\n00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:20,600\nA couple little messages flip by.\n\n298\n00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:24,160\nYou'll know it's successful if you get\na little green circle by the name.\n\n299\n00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,020\nSo I can see network account server.\n\n300\n00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:30,140\nIs set to osxserver1.local.\n\n301\n00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:34,490\nNow, once that's done our server doesn't\nreally look any different does it?\n\n302\n00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:37,530\nI mean our server, our client,\nit's still the same client.\n\n303\n00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:39,270\nBut, here's the difference, if I log out.\n\n304\n00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:44,780\nWhen I log out I'm going\nto see my little bubbles.\n\n305\n00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:46,720\nIt really doesn't look\nany different at all.\n\n306\n00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,230\nBut if you wait just a moment.\n\n307\n00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:49,270\nThere it goes.\n\n308\n00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:51,150\nYou'll see this other bubble appear.\n\n309\n00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:53,340\nNow, why did it take a moment to appear?\n\n310\n00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:55,677\nWhat happens is when you\nget to the log in screen,\n\n311\n00:15:55,677 --> 00:15:58,130\nthe local accounts are right\nhere in this machine.\n\n312\n00:15:58,130 --> 00:15:59,840\nThey pop up immediately.\n\n313\n00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:02,370\nBut That other.\n\n314\n00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:06,491\nIn the background your Mac is reaching\nout on the network to see if that open\n\n315\n00:16:06,491 --> 00:16:12,350\ndirectory server is available, and only if\nit can talk to it, will the bubble appear.\n\n316\n00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:15,490\nSo, you may have to wait a moment,\nlike I did before it appears because it's\n\n317\n00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:19,260\nchecking on the back end to make sure\nthat a server is there, all right?\n\n318\n00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:24,260\nNow if I log in with an account, a lot\nof times we end up here on this screen,\n\n319\n00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:27,280\nright, if you log out it might\nshow the most recent user and so\n\n320\n00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:30,330\nif you're on this screen you might\nneed to use, you need to use this gray\n\n321\n00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:34,390\narrow here to move back to this screen\nto see that other prompt, all right?\n\n322\n00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:37,880\nAnd if it hasn't reached out to that other\nserver they gray arrow might not appear\n\n323\n00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:42,770\nyet if you only have one user account and\nthat's it, then that gray arrow might not\n\n324\n00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:45,220\nappear until the other\nserver's been contacted, so\n\n325\n00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:49,170\nyou may need to wait a moment here before\nthe little gray circle appears, all right.\n\n326\n00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:52,100\nI've got two accounts here, so\nthat's not happening to me.\n\n327\n00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:53,225\nLet me show you what I mean,\n\n328\n00:16:53,225 --> 00:16:56,778\nbecause I do want you guys to be\nprepared if you see it in real life.\n\n329\n00:16:56,778 --> 00:17:00,690\nI'm going to delete that\nDon Pezet account, just so\n\n330\n00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:02,410\nyou can see what I'm talking about.\n\n331\n00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:04,560\nSo if I take Don Pezet and wipe him out.\n\n332\n00:17:07,986 --> 00:17:10,660\nWe'll just take him and\nknock him out of there.\n\n333\n00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:13,910\nWe'll delete his home folder.\n\n334\n00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:16,560\nAll right.\n\n335\n00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,660\nSo now I've only got one user account.\n\n336\n00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:22,620\nSo when I log out,\nthere's only one local user, so\n\n337\n00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:26,090\nit defaults to showing me the log\nin prompt for that one user, right?\n\n338\n00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:28,420\nAnd there is no other showing up for me.\n\n339\n00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:30,890\nI don't have an other to pick from.\n\n340\n00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:32,800\nBut if I wait just a moment,\n\n341\n00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:36,930\nit's reaching out on the back end to see\nif that open directory server is there and\n\n342\n00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:41,290\nif it can talk to it and it's happy,\nthen the gray arrows, and there it goes.\n\n343\n00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:44,410\nIt just appeared for me, and\nthat's when I'll be able to go back.\n\n344\n00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:47,710\nAnd hit other, so\nyou may see it like that.\n\n345\n00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:48,990\nA slight difference in the UI.\n\n346\n00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:54,090\nNow on this screen it's a little\ndifferent than what we're used to seeing.\n\n347\n00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:57,400\nThe username is not pre-populated\nbecause there's the whole directory.\n\n348\n00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,830\nThere could be thousands of accounts.\n\n349\n00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:01,390\nIt doesn't want to draw thousands\nof bubbles on the screen.\n\n350\n00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:03,420\nSo we have to type in our username.\n\n351\n00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:06,910\nAll right, our username and our password.\n\n352\n00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:09,620\nNow the username we set that\nwhen we create the user account.\n\n353\n00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:10,750\nSo like here's student one.\n\n354\n00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:15,930\nAnd if I take a look at student one they\nhave a full name of well, student one.\n\n355\n00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:19,130\nBut they have an account name\nof student and the number one.\n\n356\n00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:21,479\nSo when I go to log in I\nneed to remember that.\n\n357\n00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:27,170\nAnd if I punch that in as their full name,\nit's gonna reach out to\n\n358\n00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:31,390\nthat directory server and say, can I\nidentify who this user is, and it does.\n\n359\n00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:34,340\nI could have also logged in the student,\nand the number one.\n\n360\n00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:37,640\nStudent one like that and gotten in,\nbecause that's their account names.\n\n361\n00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,650\nSo you have that full name and\naccount name.\n\n362\n00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:41,540\nBoth of them work, all right.\n\n363\n00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:45,890\nAnd once we're logged in,\nI'm now logged in as student one.\n\n364\n00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:51,550\nI can start to do work on the system and\naccess files and browse the internet.\n\n365\n00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:53,000\nDo whatever it is that I need.\n\n366\n00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,300\nMy user account does not\nexist on this machine.\n\n367\n00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:00,770\nMy user account exist in\nthe open directory, all right.\n\n368\n00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:02,100\nSo now we can work here.\n\n369\n00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:02,700\nI can log out.\n\n370\n00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:06,140\nI can go log in on another computer and\nmy account will work there too.\n\n371\n00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:10,260\nIf I change my password on one machine,\nwell it's not actually on the machine,\n\n372\n00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:11,190\nit's on the directory.\n\n373\n00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:12,460\nSo when I go to the next machine,\n\n374\n00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:15,430\nmy new password is already\nthere waiting for me, right?\n\n375\n00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:17,770\nWe get that nice centralize management.\n\n376\n00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:19,940\nAnd things run nice and smooth, all right.\n\n377\n00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:24,030\nSo this is really handy in corporate and\nenterprise networks.\n\n378\n00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:26,720\nWe hire a new employee,\nwe just create the account once, and\n\n379\n00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,110\nit works across the machines.\n\n380\n00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:32,740\nAll right, so now they can work,\nthey can do their stuff.\n\n381\n00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:35,660\nNow this user account is just\na regular old user account.\n\n382\n00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:37,870\nSo if I try and\ngo into system preferences and\n\n383\n00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:41,240\nstart to mess with things in here,\nI'll see that any time I try and\n\n384\n00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:44,740\ndo something administrative related, I'm\ngoing to have to provide administrative\n\n385\n00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:48,100\ncredentials which\na student might not have.\n\n386\n00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:52,360\nSo they are still limited, but you can see\nthe local user accounts are still there.\n\n387\n00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:57,290\nBut I'm also bound to that\nopen directory server.\n\n388\n00:19:57,290 --> 00:19:57,880\nAll right.\n\n389\n00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:00,410\nSo, that's an example of\nusing open directory.\n\n390\n00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:04,300\nFor the exam, they don't really\ncover setting up open directory.\n\n391\n00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:06,230\nThey don't really cover\nlike the LDAP utility.\n\n392\n00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:08,600\nThey really just cover\nthe binding process.\n\n393\n00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:12,020\nMake sure you know how to bind\nthe client to open directory so\n\n394\n00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:16,510\nyou can have that centralized\nuser accounts, all right.\n\n395\n00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:20,130\nThe next thing that I want to take a look\nat it is using the active directory,\n\n396\n00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:22,500\nwhich is Microsoft solution, all right.\n\n397\n00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,350\nSo we'll take a look at that next.\n\n398\n00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:26,950\nBut this is probably a pretty good\nspot to stop and take a break.\n\n399\n00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:27,600\nLet's do that.\n\n400\n00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,140\nLet's stop here and take a pause.\n\n401\n00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:31,950\nAnd when we get back,\nI'll repeat the process, but\n\n402\n00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:33,540\nusing Microsoft's Active Directory.\n\n403\n00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:34,680\nSo stay tuned.\n\n404\n00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,324\nWe'll be back with that after this.\n\n405\n00:20:36,324 --> 00:20:43,707\n[MUSIC]\n\n406\n00:20:43,707 --> 00:20:45,200\nAll right, welcome back.\n\n407\n00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:49,040\nSo, now I want to take a look at the other\ncentralized directory we need to learn\n\n408\n00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,310\nabout, which is the Microsoft\nactive directory.\n\n409\n00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:55,260\nNow the Microsoft active directory,\nit's very similar to Open Directory,\n\n410\n00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:58,240\nexcept a heck of a lot more complex and\ndifficult to get set up.\n\n411\n00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:02,020\nSo if you've worked with it for years and\nyears and years, then it's not a big deal,\n\n412\n00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:05,070\nbut if you're just getting started,\nit's a lot harder than Open Directory.\n\n413\n00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:08,140\nWith Open Directory, you just flip\na switch, and it turns on, and\n\n414\n00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:10,460\nyou're pretty much ready\nto rock from there.\n\n415\n00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:13,080\nYou don't have to do anything too\ncrazy because that's the easy mode.\n\n416\n00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:16,740\nNow, open directory does have some\nadvanced functionality we can turn on, but\n\n417\n00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:17,940\nmost people don't need it.\n\n418\n00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:19,865\nSo, it really is just flipping a switch.\n\n419\n00:21:19,865 --> 00:21:20,735\nWith active directory,\n\n420\n00:21:20,735 --> 00:21:22,885\nit's like going into advanced mode\nright from the very beginning.\n\n421\n00:21:22,885 --> 00:21:24,995\nThere's no easy mode with it.\n\n422\n00:21:24,995 --> 00:21:27,525\nBut once it's configured,\nit works very similar.\n\n423\n00:21:27,525 --> 00:21:28,905\nAnd let me just show you,\n\n424\n00:21:28,905 --> 00:21:32,665\nwe don't want to spend too much\ntime looking at a Microsoft server,\n\n425\n00:21:32,665 --> 00:21:37,870\nbut I basically whipped up a quick active\ndirectory here with some student accounts,\n\n426\n00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:42,120\nstudent one, two, and three, and teacher\naccounts, teacher one, two, and three.\n\n427\n00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:46,540\nAnd I set them up just like I did in open\ndirectory, so if I take my students and\n\n428\n00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:51,050\nI go into student one, I can see that\nthey have a full name of student one and\n\n429\n00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:53,480\na username of student and the number one.\n\n430\n00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,590\nSo just like I had in open directory.\n\n431\n00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:59,040\nNow, you might ask yourself, wait a minute\nDon, if you set them up the same way,\n\n432\n00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:01,030\nhow do we know we're actually\nlogging in to the other one.\n\n433\n00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:02,550\nWell, I used different passwords.\n\n434\n00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:04,990\nThat way I would make sure\nI knew the difference.\n\n435\n00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,000\nBetween the two accounts.\n\n436\n00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,040\nBut basically I just whipped up those same\naccounts in this centralized database,\n\n437\n00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,145\nall right.\n\n438\n00:22:12,145 --> 00:22:16,230\nNow if I jump back over here to my client.\n\n439\n00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:20,210\nMy client is already bound\nto the open directory.\n\n440\n00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:24,240\nBut I can just turn around and\nrebind it over to the active directory.\n\n441\n00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,070\nNow it will authenticate\nagainst that system.\n\n442\n00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:29,422\nSo I'm going to go back\ninto my system preferences.\n\n443\n00:22:32,428 --> 00:22:34,430\nAnd I'll go into my users and groups.\n\n444\n00:22:36,468 --> 00:22:39,400\nAnd I'm going into my, actually before\nI dive in there and turn it on,\n\n445\n00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,680\nlet me give you one comment here.\n\n446\n00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:44,490\nOn the Apple side,\nwhen we do open directory,\n\n447\n00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:49,510\nwe can find an open directory\nserver by DNS or by bonjour.\n\n448\n00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:54,040\nAnd the bonjour protocol where we can\njust discover systems on the network.\n\n449\n00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,180\nSo that makes life really easy.\n\n450\n00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:57,350\nWe don't have to do anything crazy.\n\n451\n00:22:57,350 --> 00:23:01,390\nWith active directory, with Microsoft's\nactive directory, it's a Microsoft thing.\n\n452\n00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:05,010\nSo we on the Apple side can't\njust automatically discover it.\n\n453\n00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:08,540\nSo when I go to bind to it,\nI can't just browse and find it.\n\n454\n00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:11,380\nSo, what's going happen\nhere is usually two things.\n\n455\n00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:14,710\nOne, whoever the Microsoft admin is,\n\n456\n00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:18,310\nis going to tell you the name\nof the active directory domain.\n\n457\n00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:20,240\nThey call it a domain under\nthe active directory.\n\n458\n00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,600\nSo they're going to tell you the name\nof that active directory install.\n\n459\n00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,420\nAnd then the second thing\nthey're going to tell you\n\n460\n00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:29,830\nare the DNS servers that you have to use.\n\n461\n00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:34,070\nYou have to use name servers that\ncontain the records that tell us\n\n462\n00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:36,440\nhow to get to the active directory,\nall right.\n\n463\n00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:40,070\nSo I mention that here because I was\njust about to go in here and bind, but\n\n464\n00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:44,180\nstep one might be for\nus to go into our network settings and\n\n465\n00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:48,100\nadjust the DNS that we're\nusing on our ethernet adaptor.\n\n466\n00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:52,550\nSo we might need to go in here and tweak\nthe DNS servers that we're using to point\n\n467\n00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:54,460\nto the ones our admins tell us, all right.\n\n468\n00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:56,230\nYou may not have to do that.\n\n469\n00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:58,550\nA lot of networks use\nautomatic configuration.\n\n470\n00:23:58,550 --> 00:24:01,893\nAnd so you may already have\nthe appropriate DNS servers to be able to\n\n471\n00:24:01,893 --> 00:24:02,500\nwork with.\n\n472\n00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,302\nBut I just wanted you to be aware of that,\n\n473\n00:24:04,302 --> 00:24:06,960\nthat active directory does\nrequire you to use DNS servers.\n\n474\n00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,670\nThat have specific records, and\nnot every DNS server has those.\n\n475\n00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:15,836\nAll right, so I'm just gonna go\nback to my users accounts now, and\n\n476\n00:24:15,836 --> 00:24:19,896\nI need to modify my login options, so\nI'm gonna have to unlock this screen.\n\n477\n00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:24,890\nThere we go.\n\n478\n00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:28,310\nAnd you can see,\nI'm still bound to the OSX/server1.local.\n\n479\n00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:30,300\nI'll just edit that.\n\n480\n00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:33,080\nAnd so there's my Open Directory Server.\n\n481\n00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:36,810\nI'm just gonna hit my plus sign here,\nand remember,\n\n482\n00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:39,880\nit'll find the Open Directory Servers\non the network.\n\n483\n00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:42,430\nIt's not finding my\nActive Directory servers,\n\n484\n00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:45,970\nso I need to type in the name\nof the domain I'm gonna join.\n\n485\n00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:50,060\nSo I call up my admin, which is me,\none of the many conversations I have with\n\n486\n00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:52,770\nmyself in a day, and I say,\nhey, what is the domain name?\n\n487\n00:24:52,770 --> 00:24:57,229\nAnd they tell me it's lab.itpro.tv.\n\n488\n00:24:57,229 --> 00:24:58,760\nSo I punch that in.\n\n489\n00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:01,500\nNow the instant you punch\nin a name like that,\n\n490\n00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:04,630\nyour Mac will realize that\nsomething weird is happening here.\n\n491\n00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:07,190\nNot weird, it just knows that you're\nconnecting to an Active Directory.\n\n492\n00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:10,350\nSo see how it's switched,\nand I see this dialogue box.\n\n493\n00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:12,950\nIf you don't get this dialogue box,\n\n494\n00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:16,690\nthat's a great indicator that\nyou're using the wrong DNS servers.\n\n495\n00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:19,660\nOr that the DNS server that you're\npointing at just doesn't have the records\n\n496\n00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:20,580\nnecessary.\n\n497\n00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:23,580\nSo if I start to punch\nextra numbers in here or\n\n498\n00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:26,030\nwhatever, see how it's\ndoing the spinning wheel?\n\n499\n00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:30,810\nNow it's trying to find lab2.itpro.tv,\nwhich doesn't exist,\n\n500\n00:25:30,810 --> 00:25:33,940\nand, well, wait a minute, I say it doesn't\nexist, I think Nate might have made that.\n\n501\n00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:34,670\nThere we go.\n\n502\n00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:39,610\nSo it didn't find it, and so\nI don't get the prompts to enter in data.\n\n503\n00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:42,670\nWhen I put in lab.itpro.tv, it found it.\n\n504\n00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:47,470\nThat means it successfully found the DNS\nrecords, the records for this host,\n\n505\n00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:50,828\nfor the Active Directory and\nwe're ready to proceed.\n\n506\n00:25:50,828 --> 00:25:53,720\nSo, that would be your indicator right\nthere that DNS wasn't set up right.\n\n507\n00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,650\nNow it's asking for\nthree pieces of information.\n\n508\n00:25:57,650 --> 00:25:59,260\nI really only need two.\n\n509\n00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:01,220\nTo connect to the Active Directory,\n\n510\n00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:05,350\nit only does secure credential\nconnections, which means,\n\n511\n00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:10,200\nin order to bind to it, you have to\nhave a valid user name and password.\n\n512\n00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:13,650\nSo it's asking for\nan Active Directory admin user and\n\n513\n00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:16,290\nadmin password to be\nable to connect to it.\n\n514\n00:26:16,290 --> 00:26:18,130\nOpen Directory's a little more trusting.\n\n515\n00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:20,820\nWhen I connected to it,\nit didn't prompt me for that.\n\n516\n00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:23,420\nIt warned me about SSL and\nthen it connected and that was that.\n\n517\n00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:25,860\nBut here, it's asking for\nthat admin password.\n\n518\n00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:28,470\nSo I've gotta provide\none to get connected.\n\n519\n00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:31,160\nThe third piece of information\nis this client computer ID.\n\n520\n00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:33,320\nAnd you'll see what it is showing here.\n\n521\n00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:34,910\nIt's showing the name I gave this system.\n\n522\n00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:41,288\nBy default, your Mac will have a name of\nwell, you know when you did the initial,\n\n523\n00:26:41,288 --> 00:26:45,037\nturn it on for the first time,\nand asked you what your name was.\n\n524\n00:26:45,037 --> 00:26:47,020\nSo let's say you put in Don Pezet, right?\n\n525\n00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:53,185\nSo it would say Don's MacBook Pro, or\nDon's Mac Pro, or Don's Macbook Air.\n\n526\n00:26:53,185 --> 00:26:56,470\nThat's what it would say as\nthe name of that machine.\n\n527\n00:26:56,470 --> 00:26:59,940\nAnd if you just have one machine,\nthat's fine.\n\n528\n00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:02,680\nBut if this is a shared machine that\nfive people use, it's not really\n\n529\n00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:07,190\nDon's Macbook Pro, it's the IT Pro TV\nMacbook Pro, or something of that nature.\n\n530\n00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:11,030\nSo the name doesn't quite match up right,\nand so we may want to change that.\n\n531\n00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:15,420\nAnd you can change it right here,\nby specifying that client computer ID.\n\n532\n00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:17,370\nThat's the name of your computer,\n\n533\n00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:21,360\nof this client, not the name of\nthe active directory server, or anything.\n\n534\n00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,830\nThat's where it gets confusing.\n\n535\n00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:24,730\nIt's something you need to remember for\nthe exam.\n\n536\n00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:26,740\nThis is the client computer ID,\n\n537\n00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:29,140\nthe computer you're sitting at,\nnot the server.\n\n538\n00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:35,080\nNow, if you want to change that name ahead\nof time, let me just cancel out of this.\n\n539\n00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:38,390\nIf you want to change it ahead of time,\nback here in System Preferences,\n\n540\n00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:41,010\nyou've got the Sharing System Preference.\n\n541\n00:27:41,010 --> 00:27:44,150\nAnd it's right in here that you'll\nsee the name of that machine.\n\n542\n00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:48,110\nAnd so this one used to say, well I\ncreated a user on here called Help Desk.\n\n543\n00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:51,158\nAnd so this used to say,\nhelps MacBook Pro, right?\n\n544\n00:27:51,158 --> 00:27:52,864\nIt is what it used to say,\nand then I changed it.\n\n545\n00:27:52,864 --> 00:27:55,604\nSay OSX-CLIENT1.\n\n546\n00:27:55,604 --> 00:27:58,000\nSo you can modify that\nname ahead of time here.\n\n547\n00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,540\nAnd you can modify that name,\neven if you're not using Active Directory.\n\n548\n00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:03,310\nIf you're just using it as a stand\nalone machine, I normally rename mine.\n\n549\n00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:06,240\nBut, I'm gonna go back and bind.\n\n550\n00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:09,058\nSo, let me go back into my users,\nand my log in options.\n\n551\n00:28:09,058 --> 00:28:11,380\nAnd I'm gonna go in here and Edit,\n\n552\n00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:15,080\nand I'll add in that\nActive Directory Server again.\n\n553\n00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:18,459\nNow I'm happy with osx-client1.\n\n554\n00:28:18,459 --> 00:28:21,860\nI'm not gonna change that, and\nthen I'll punch in an admin user.\n\n555\n00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:30,620\nAnd that's an account that already exists\nin the active directory, so there it goes.\n\n556\n00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:34,298\nAnd now I've got lab in my list.\n\n557\n00:28:34,298 --> 00:28:39,860\nI've got osx-server1.local, and I've got\nlab, which is an Active Directory domain.\n\n558\n00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:42,300\nSo I see it there in the list,\nand I can hit Done.\n\n559\n00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:47,970\nNow notice what I've got right now,\nmultiple.\n\n560\n00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:51,720\nI'm set up to authenticate\nagainst multiple sources.\n\n561\n00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:56,170\nI can authenticate against\nOpen Directory and Active Directory.\n\n562\n00:28:56,170 --> 00:28:59,930\nNow, that might seem like a good thing\nto begin with, but it really isn't.\n\n563\n00:28:59,930 --> 00:29:02,070\nThe multiple environments are a mess.\n\n564\n00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:05,760\nEvery time I add a new user account, I'm\ngonna have to add them in Open Directory\n\n565\n00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:09,080\nand Active Directory,\nwhich makes things less convenient.\n\n566\n00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,730\nThe other thing is,\nI always run the risk of having a user\n\n567\n00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:13,960\nname in each environment\nwith the same name.\n\n568\n00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,370\nI have that right now.\n\n569\n00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:19,828\nI've got Student One on Open Directory and\nI've got Student One on Active Directory,\n\n570\n00:29:19,828 --> 00:29:21,918\nand they've got different passwords.\n\n571\n00:29:21,918 --> 00:29:25,754\nSo when I go to log in, It's gonna have to\ntry both servers to figure out which one\n\n572\n00:29:25,754 --> 00:29:28,890\nI'm talking about, and\nthat can be problematic, too.\n\n573\n00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:32,590\nSo, we don't typically want to have\ntwo connected, and on the exam,\n\n574\n00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:34,040\nyou won't see with two connected.\n\n575\n00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:37,770\nSo, I'm gonna go in here and\nremove my Open Directory Server.\n\n576\n00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:40,850\nSo I'll just highlight it and\nhit the minus to get rid of it, and\n\n577\n00:29:40,850 --> 00:29:45,680\nI'll say to stop using that server, so now\nI just have that active directory domain.\n\n578\n00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:50,748\nAnd I'll see it updates here to\nshow that I am connected to LAB.\n\n579\n00:29:50,748 --> 00:29:52,758\nNow over on the Microsoft side,\n\n580\n00:29:52,758 --> 00:29:57,210\nI don't really see any difference\nhere because I added that Mac.\n\n581\n00:29:57,210 --> 00:30:00,750\nIf I go under My Computers,\nI do see that it created a client.\n\n582\n00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:04,940\nSo I've got my Windows client one, and\nnow I've got my Mac OSX client one, and\n\n583\n00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:06,350\nit is showing up in Active Directory.\n\n584\n00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:08,240\nSo it created that computer account.\n\n585\n00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,270\nAnd I'm now bound to the AD, all right?\n\n586\n00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:13,860\nAnd that means when I go\nto log into this Mac,\n\n587\n00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:16,010\nI can now login with my\nActive Directory account.\n\n588\n00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:18,140\nSo, let's give it a shot.\n\n589\n00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:22,170\nNow I'm logged in as student1 right now,\nwhich was a network account that came from\n\n590\n00:30:22,170 --> 00:30:24,270\nOpen Directory,\nwhich I've now disconnected.\n\n591\n00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:27,660\nSo I'm gonna move to a different\naccount to make sure we do a fair test.\n\n592\n00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:29,510\nI'm gonna login as teacher1.\n\n593\n00:30:29,510 --> 00:30:31,140\nAll right, so let me log out.\n\n594\n00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:35,770\nAnd when I log out,\nit's gonna take me to log in screen.\n\n595\n00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:39,250\nAnd again, I'm gonna have to wait a\nmoment, while it reaches out to make sure\n\n596\n00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:41,820\nthe Active Directory Server\nis able to be contacted.\n\n597\n00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:44,480\nAnd my little gray arrow will\nappear here any moment now.\n\n598\n00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,910\nThis is where I start to get impatient.\n\n599\n00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:49,330\nThe more you click the mouse,\nthe faster it will happen.\n\n600\n00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:55,383\nBut eventually, my little arrow\nwill appear in time [LAUGH].\n\n601\n00:30:55,383 --> 00:30:57,682\nAll right, apparently it's\ngonna test my patience here.\n\n602\n00:30:57,682 --> 00:31:02,888\n[LAUGH] Well, if it doesn't appear,\n\n603\n00:31:02,888 --> 00:31:06,995\nif you don't get your other window, there\nis actually a keyboard shortcut you can\n\n604\n00:31:06,995 --> 00:31:11,060\nhit to force it to come up, and I cannot\nremember what that keyboard shortcut is.\n\n605\n00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:14,090\nWow, it is taking, oh, there we go.\n\n606\n00:31:14,090 --> 00:31:17,390\nAll right, it took a nice long time for\nthat to pop up, but there we go.\n\n607\n00:31:17,390 --> 00:31:19,200\nSo I can hit it and I can go to my other,\n\n608\n00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:23,150\nand I'm gonna log in\nas teacher1 this time.\n\n609\n00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:28,250\nNow, I disconnected from Open Directory,\nand\n\n610\n00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:31,480\nI'm only connected to Active Directory.\n\n611\n00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,475\nAnd I know that user name, and\nI'm punching in the password, and\n\n612\n00:31:33,475 --> 00:31:35,056\nthe password was different for\nActive Directory.\n\n613\n00:31:35,056 --> 00:31:36,865\nSo I know that I'm punching\nin the information for\n\n614\n00:31:36,865 --> 00:31:38,740\nthe one from Active Directory.\n\n615\n00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:42,220\nAnd when I go to log in,\nwe should see success.\n\n616\n00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:44,720\nNow, there is one other\nthing that's important.\n\n617\n00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:48,380\nI'll get to it in just a second,\nbut for the most part, that's it.\n\n618\n00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:49,610\nI just logged in.\n\n619\n00:31:49,610 --> 00:31:50,980\nI'm now teacher one.\n\n620\n00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:54,508\nThis is the teacher one account that\ncame over from the Active Directory, and\n\n621\n00:31:54,508 --> 00:31:55,710\nI can work with my system.\n\n622\n00:31:55,710 --> 00:31:57,551\nI can browse the Internet,\n\n623\n00:31:57,551 --> 00:32:01,880\ndo whatever it is that I need to do\nto have a good time on my system.\n\n624\n00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:06,340\nAnd if I go into my System Preferences.\n\n625\n00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:09,000\nAnd I take a look at my users and groups.\n\n626\n00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,630\nI'll see that I'm Teacher1, and\nit's a network account, and\n\n627\n00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:14,420\nI'm showing as being managed.\n\n628\n00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:16,449\nActive directors are treated\nas managed by default.\n\n629\n00:32:16,449 --> 00:32:20,428\nThat let's us know that it's actually\ncoming from the active directory, and\n\n630\n00:32:20,428 --> 00:32:22,899\nthen it's got certain\npolicies assigned to it,\n\n631\n00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:25,749\nwhich we talked a bit in\nthe Mac Management Basics show.\n\n632\n00:32:25,749 --> 00:32:30,027\nBut we don't really go too crazy on,\nbut that means that the account can be\n\n633\n00:32:30,027 --> 00:32:34,380\ndisabled and we can do some\nremote wipe type functionality.\n\n634\n00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:37,580\nAll right, so I can see that I'm there,\nI'm connected.\n\n635\n00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:41,540\nI still show that I'm bound to the lab\ndirectory, so I'm connected there,\n\n636\n00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:45,510\nthat's where my account came from,\nand I'm able to log in and work.\n\n637\n00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:47,910\nAll right, now I mentioned there's\none other thing that was important.\n\n638\n00:32:47,910 --> 00:32:52,676\nBack on that log in screen, when I went\nto log in, I logged in as Student1.\n\n639\n00:32:52,676 --> 00:32:58,570\nRight, so back here at my logout screen,\n\n640\n00:32:58,570 --> 00:33:02,070\nand I guess I could wait 20 minutes for\nthat grey arrow to appear again, but\n\n641\n00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:05,710\nwhen I went to log in it had\nthe username and password blanks, right?\n\n642\n00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:09,250\nAnd for the username blank I just typed\nin Teacher1, that was my username.\n\n643\n00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:10,160\nAll right?\n\n644\n00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:14,920\nWhen we were connected to open directory,\nI could log in with Student1,\n\n645\n00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:20,570\nas in student and the number 1,\nor I could log in as Student one,\n\n646\n00:33:20,570 --> 00:33:23,538\nthe word its really confusing\nto say let me write these out.\n\n647\n00:33:23,538 --> 00:33:27,290\nSeems like I got a notepad\nwindow around here somewhere.\n\n648\n00:33:29,970 --> 00:33:31,290\nHere we go, okay.\n\n649\n00:33:31,290 --> 00:33:39,220\nSo when bound to open directory right,\nso I was able to enter in for\n\n650\n00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:44,310\nthe user name I was able to login as\nStudent One which was my full name.\n\n651\n00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:49,750\nAnd I was able to log in as\nStudent1 which was my account name.\n\n652\n00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:50,410\nRight.\n\n653\n00:33:50,410 --> 00:33:57,450\nSo that's account name and full name.\n\n654\n00:33:57,450 --> 00:34:00,060\nThose were the two values that\nI could provide there for\n\n655\n00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:01,800\nmy username with open directory.\n\n656\n00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:02,600\nAll right?\n\n657\n00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,643\nBut with active directory it's different.\n\n658\n00:34:11,179 --> 00:34:12,859\nWith active directory,\n\n659\n00:34:12,859 --> 00:34:18,450\nthere's actually three ways that we\ncan provide the username, all right?\n\n660\n00:34:18,450 --> 00:34:21,800\nThe first way is using the account name,\nwhat I just did a moment ago.\n\n661\n00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:24,950\nSo I did Teacher1 like that, all right?\n\n662\n00:34:24,950 --> 00:34:27,960\nSo that is the account name.\n\n663\n00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:33,020\nI could also log in as\n\n664\n00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:40,730\nTeacher1@lab.itpro.tv, okay?\n\n665\n00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:43,190\nNow remember when I bound\nto the active directory and\n\n666\n00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:47,650\nhad to type in the name of the directory,\nI typed in lab.itpro.tv.\n\n667\n00:34:47,650 --> 00:34:50,811\nThat is the fully qualified.\n\n668\n00:34:53,969 --> 00:34:55,620\nAccount name, all right?\n\n669\n00:34:55,620 --> 00:35:01,050\nAnd fully qualified means that I'm telling\nit exactly what domain it's a part of.\n\n670\n00:35:01,050 --> 00:35:03,920\nIn the Active Directory,\nit's very powerful.\n\n671\n00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:06,720\nAnd so it can handle extremely large\norganizations where we might have\n\n672\n00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:09,340\nmore than one domain\ninside of our company,\n\n673\n00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:11,728\nwhere we might have more than one\ndivision inside of our company.\n\n674\n00:35:11,728 --> 00:35:15,236\nOpen directory doesn't support that,\nwell shouldn't say that way.\n\n675\n00:35:15,236 --> 00:35:19,230\nOpen directory as Apple has implemented\nit, doesn't support that natively.\n\n676\n00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:20,630\nIt's not right there.\n\n677\n00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:25,425\nYou can make it do it, but not the way\nthat Apple has it set up default.\n\n678\n00:35:25,425 --> 00:35:27,085\nIn the active directory,\nit's got that support.\n\n679\n00:35:27,085 --> 00:35:30,895\nSo this other username is specifying\nnot just the username, but\n\n680\n00:35:30,895 --> 00:35:33,005\nalso the domain to log into.\n\n681\n00:35:33,005 --> 00:35:35,445\nNow that's the new way\nthat Microsoft does it.\n\n682\n00:35:35,445 --> 00:35:37,757\nThey've been doing that since 2000.\n\n683\n00:35:37,757 --> 00:35:40,747\nPrior to 2000 there was\nan old way to do it\n\n684\n00:35:40,747 --> 00:35:43,787\nwhich was to type in the alias for\nthat domain.\n\n685\n00:35:43,787 --> 00:35:46,577\nThey call it a net bios name,\ndon't worry about it.\n\n686\n00:35:46,577 --> 00:35:50,927\nBut the other way would be\nto type in lab\\teacher1.\n\n687\n00:35:50,927 --> 00:35:54,367\nRemember when I logged in,\nit said that I was bound to lab.\n\n688\n00:35:54,367 --> 00:35:59,637\nThat's that alias for the domain,\nand so that would be the old style.\n\n689\n00:36:01,510 --> 00:36:05,480\nLog in where you're specifying\ndomain slash user name, all right.\n\n690\n00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:09,750\nSo three different ways,\nnone of which are the full name.\n\n691\n00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:13,310\nI couldn't type in Teacher1 as words,\nlike this.\n\n692\n00:36:13,310 --> 00:36:15,670\nIt's got to be one of these three formats.\n\n693\n00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:20,240\nSo usernames are a little less flexible\ninside of active directory, and\n\n694\n00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:23,330\nit's because they have\nto make allowance for\n\n695\n00:36:23,330 --> 00:36:25,980\nhaving multiple users with the same name,\nright?\n\n696\n00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:29,100\nI might have two users named John Doe.\n\n697\n00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:32,350\nWell, the open directory doesn't\naccount for that very well.\n\n698\n00:36:33,570 --> 00:36:35,500\nYou know I hate to make it sound negative.\n\n699\n00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:37,030\nOpen directory is very powerful.\n\n700\n00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:38,500\nIt can do a lot of stuff.\n\n701\n00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:42,490\nThe native way, the way that it's set\nup by default doesn't account for\n\n702\n00:36:42,490 --> 00:36:44,150\ntwo people with the same name very well.\n\n703\n00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:45,900\nSo that's where we start\nto have the problems.\n\n704\n00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:48,884\nAnd you can tweak it and\nmake it handle that better if you want.\n\n705\n00:36:48,884 --> 00:36:52,160\nBut active directory handles it\nlike that from the very beginning.\n\n706\n00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:55,690\nIt's part of the reason why active\ndirectory is so complex to set up.\n\n707\n00:36:55,690 --> 00:36:56,817\nBecause it's already planning for\n\n708\n00:36:56,817 --> 00:36:58,889\nthese eventualities right from\nthe very beginning, all right.\n\n709\n00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:03,410\nSo, three different usernames,\nthat's all the same person.\n\n710\n00:37:03,410 --> 00:37:07,250\nIf I log in as any of those three,\nwe'll see the same information, and\n\n711\n00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:08,500\nwe could test that.\n\n712\n00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:11,600\nProbably extremely boring,\nbut we could test that out\n\n713\n00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:15,460\nif we wanted to by changing the wallpaper,\nor something that to see each one.\n\n714\n00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:18,407\nBut if I wanna log in\nhere as lab/ Teacher1.\n\n715\n00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:24,100\nThat'll be that same account and\nI can get logged in and work with my data.\n\n716\n00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:26,740\nIt's not a new, in fact,\nsee how it automatically opened this\n\n717\n00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:30,190\nfolder that I had open before\ncuz it's still my same account.\n\n718\n00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:33,550\nIf I go into system preferences and users.\n\n719\n00:37:33,550 --> 00:37:36,220\nI'll see there's only one teacher one,\nit didn't add a second one.\n\n720\n00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:36,880\nIt's the same account.\n\n721\n00:37:38,792 --> 00:37:41,880\nAll right, so\nthat's the process right there for\n\n722\n00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:45,410\nbinding to open directory and\nbinding to active directory.\n\n723\n00:37:45,410 --> 00:37:50,350\nThose are the two supported directory\nservices that are out there on your Macs.\n\n724\n00:37:50,350 --> 00:37:53,790\nNow there are other directory services\navailable, but these are the two that\n\n725\n00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:57,020\nApple supports out of the box and\nhonestly they're probably the two best.\n\n726\n00:37:57,020 --> 00:38:00,220\nActive directory being the most common,\nopen directory being the one that's\n\n727\n00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:04,190\ndirectly Apple supported and\njust super stable and easy to deploy.\n\n728\n00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:05,210\nLots of benefits there, so.\n\n729\n00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:10,380\nAll right, well that's about all\nwe've got for network accounts.\n\n730\n00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:13,080\nIn the next show we're going to\nbe tackling file sharing, and\n\n731\n00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:16,530\nwith file sharing we're gonna talk\nabout how to provide network access,\n\n732\n00:38:16,530 --> 00:38:19,460\nand that's where our network accounts\nare really gonna come in handy too.\n\n733\n00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:22,270\nSo we'll get a chance to see\nthat in our next episodes, so\n\n734\n00:38:22,270 --> 00:38:24,050\nmake sure you stay tuned for that.\n\n735\n00:38:24,050 --> 00:38:28,080\nIn the meantime, if you have any questions\non what we covered in this show,\n\n736\n00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:33,350\nmake sure, if it's live, live during the\nshow you can go to http://itpro.tv/live,\n\n737\n00:38:33,350 --> 00:38:35,580\nyou'll see the chat box\nright beneath the video.\n\n738\n00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:37,280\nBut if you're watching this recorded,\n\n739\n00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:40,130\nmake sure you take advantage\nof our Q&A section.\n\n740\n00:38:40,130 --> 00:38:43,647\nAt the top of every page of my itpro.tv\nyou'll see a link that says Q&A.\n\n741\n00:38:43,647 --> 00:38:46,660\nIt'll take you into the forms and\nyou can post your questions there.\n\n742\n00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:47,650\nWe monitor and answer.\n\n743\n00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:49,940\nWe wanna make sure you guys get\nthe information you need so\n\n744\n00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:51,630\nyou can be successful on that exam.\n\n745\n00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:54,880\nSo definitely take advantage of\nthat resource, it's there for you.\n\n746\n00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:57,080\nAll right,\nwell I hope you guys enjoyed the show.\n\n747\n00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:59,408\nSigning off for itpro.tv, I Don Pezet.\n\n748\n00:38:59,408 --> 00:39:01,334\nAnd I'll see you next time.\n\n749\n00:39:01,334 --> 00:39:11,334\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

evening.\n\n4\n00:00:36,171 --> 00:00:41,047\nAnd, welcome back to another episode of\nITProTV, I am your slightly uncoordinated\n\n5\n00:00:41,047 --> 00:00:45,447\nhost Don Pezet, back with another\nepisode of Apple Certified Associates,\n\n6\n00:00:45,447 --> 00:00:49,150\nmore specifically the Mac\nintegration basics show.\n\n7\n00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:50,700\nSo this is episode number 2, and\n\n8\n00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,970\nwe're going to be diving in,\nor episode number 3?\n\n9\n00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:55,440\nI don't know.\nWhatever episode number it is.\n\n10\n00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:00,120\nWe're going t o be diving into file\nsharing, so how can we share information\n\n11\n00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:04,570\nthat's on one Mac with the other Macs on\nour network, or maybe not even a Mac.\n\n12\n00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:07,580\nMaybe we have a Unix system or a Windows\nsystem or something like that, and\n\n13\n00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:10,430\nwe want to share data\nbetween the two systems.\n\n14\n00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:11,070\nAll right.\n\n15\n00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:15,360\nWell, Mac OS has a full suite\nof connectivity protocols, so\n\n16\n00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,260\nwe actually have a lot of power.\n\n17\n00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:18,640\nJust right here, ready to do.\n\n18\n00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,140\nSo, let's take a look at that.\n\n19\n00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:23,650\nNow, I want to start out just\nkind of covering the different\n\n20\n00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:27,950\nways that are supported, because you know\nthat you can share content between Macs.\n\n21\n00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:28,940\nThat makes sense.\n\n22\n00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:32,340\nBut, you can also share between Mac and\nWindows, or Mac and Linux.\n\n23\n00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:34,740\nSo, you do have a lot of flexibility.\n\n24\n00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:40,130\nThat flexibility comes from all of the\ndifferent protocols that Mac OS supports.\n\n25\n00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:43,820\nSo, let's take a look\nat all those protocols.\n\n26\n00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:45,290\nLet me just move some of stuff off here.\n\n27\n00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:46,550\nHere we go.\n\n28\n00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:49,130\nMac OS right out of the box,\nhave native support for\n\n29\n00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:52,430\nsix different file sharing protocols,\nall right?\n\n30\n00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:53,960\nSome of these are very popular,\n\n31\n00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:57,560\nones you'll use all the time, others\nare ones that you'll use very rarely.\n\n32\n00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:00,230\nSo let me just run down the list and\nkind of show you.\n\n33\n00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:03,690\nThe first one is AFP,\nthe Apple file protocol and of course\n\n34\n00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:07,330\nit makes sense we're going to support\nthat one because it's an Apple product.\n\n35\n00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:11,360\nSo when you're sharing data\nbetween two Macs You're using AFP.\n\n36\n00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:17,350\nBut if you're going from Mac to Windows,\nwell, Windows doesn't support AFP.\n\n37\n00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:23,345\nWindows uses a file sharing protocol\ncalled server message block, or SMB.\n\n38\n00:02:23,345 --> 00:02:24,075\nAll right.\n\n39\n00:02:24,075 --> 00:02:27,005\nYou'll here some people on\nthe internet call it SAMBA.\n\n40\n00:02:27,005 --> 00:02:30,815\nSAMBA's actually an open source\nimplementation of SMB, so\n\n41\n00:02:30,815 --> 00:02:33,015\nSAMBA is a program, not the protocol.\n\n42\n00:02:33,015 --> 00:02:34,400\nThe protocol itself is SMB.\n\n43\n00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,262\nAnd server message block is it's private.\n\n44\n00:02:37,262 --> 00:02:41,172\nIt was developed originally by Intel,\nbut it's now owned by Microsoft, and\n\n45\n00:02:41,172 --> 00:02:43,032\nit's a Microsoft thing.\n\n46\n00:02:43,032 --> 00:02:46,812\nSo if somebody wants to support SMB,\nthey have to license it, and\n\n47\n00:02:46,812 --> 00:02:47,642\nthat's what Apple did.\n\n48\n00:02:47,642 --> 00:02:49,930\nApple reached out to Microsoft and\nbought a license so\n\n49\n00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:52,940\nthat we could integrate with those\nWindows machines, all right?\n\n50\n00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:57,660\nNow, SMB is the name for\nthe proprietary software.\n\n51\n00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:03,510\nMicrosoft has open sourced some of it and\nso the open source freely available one\n\n52\n00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:08,550\nis called CIFTS or\ncommon internet file system, all right?.\n\n53\n00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:11,390\nSNB and\nCIFTS are obviously the same thing.\n\n54\n00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:14,010\nThey're fully compatible\nwith each other and so,\n\n55\n00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:16,380\nyou can use the names interchangeably.\n\n56\n00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:20,310\nJust remember that CIFTS is like\nthe open standard that anyone can run\n\n57\n00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:21,630\nwithout licensing.\n\n58\n00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:23,960\nSMB is the one that\ndoes require licensing.\n\n59\n00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:27,840\nSMB has some extra security features\nthat are not included in SIFS, but\n\n60\n00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,330\nfunctionality wise the two\nare completely compatible.\n\n61\n00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:34,530\nSo when we connect to one\nof these file shares,\n\n62\n00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:37,610\nwhether it's SMB of SIFS,\nwe actually connect the same way.\n\n63\n00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:43,774\nSee here with AFP, when we connect\nto a server, we specify afp://,\n\n64\n00:03:43,774 --> 00:03:49,460\nkind of like a web address,\nhttp://, here it's afp://.\n\n65\n00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:51,140\nFollowed by the server name and\n\n66\n00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:53,980\nthen the folder name that we're\nconnecting to, all right?\n\n67\n00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:58,970\nWith CIFS and SMB,\nin both scenarios we say smb:// whatever.\n\n68\n00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:09,420\nNow, Mac OS, the user interface, all the\nvisual elements of it, that's 100% Apple.\n\n69\n00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:14,610\nBut under the hood, it's running BSD,\nwhich is a Unix based operating system.\n\n70\n00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:15,700\nAnd in the Unix world,\n\n71\n00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:20,390\nthe most common file sharing system\nis NFS, the Network File System.\n\n72\n00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:22,770\nAnd so, we have NSF support.\n\n73\n00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:23,490\nAnd again,\n\n74\n00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:27,530\nconnect to that would just be NSF://\nfollowed by the server and folder name.\n\n75\n00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:33,390\nThere are a few less common\nones supported, like webdav.\n\n76\n00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:37,090\nWebdav is web distributed authoring and\nversioning.\n\n77\n00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:42,160\nIt's a file protocol that actually uses\nweb standards, or HTTP, to connect.\n\n78\n00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,180\nIt's not very popular because there's been\nsome high visibility security flaws and\n\n79\n00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:47,380\nweb dab over the years.\n\n80\n00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:51,495\nSo, a lot of network admins and\npeople like me really hate to\n\n81\n00:04:51,495 --> 00:04:55,785\nimplement it if they can avoid it,\nso it's not popular as the others.\n\n82\n00:04:55,785 --> 00:04:59,935\nAnd then there's good old FTP,\nthe File Transfer Protocol.\n\n83\n00:04:59,935 --> 00:05:04,585\nFTP is a super easy way to transfer\nfiles between any system, Windows,\n\n84\n00:05:04,585 --> 00:05:09,465\nLinux, Mac, whatever, but it does\neverything in a very nonsecure way.\n\n85\n00:05:09,465 --> 00:05:12,195\nYou have usernames and passwords,\nbut they're sent in plain\n\n86\n00:05:12,195 --> 00:05:15,700\ntext over the network, so\nit's a securities professionals nightmare.\n\n87\n00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:17,490\nBut we do have support for that one too.\n\n88\n00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:21,800\nFTP, colon, slash, slash,\nfollowed by server name and folder name.\n\n89\n00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,860\nSupport for\nall of these protocols is native.\n\n90\n00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:25,630\nIt's cooked in.\n\n91\n00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:28,710\nIt's built right in to\nthe operating system.\n\n92\n00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:31,780\nYou might have other systems\nthat you want to connect to.\n\n93\n00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:34,060\nWell, just because it's not native\ndoesn't mean you can't do it.\n\n94\n00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:36,720\nThere's plenty of third part software\nthat's out there that you can use.\n\n95\n00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,310\nIn fact, I use here on my desktop.\n\n96\n00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:40,380\nLet's see which one of these icons.\n\n97\n00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:41,260\nThis one.\n\n98\n00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:45,250\nI use a program called Expand Drive, and\nthat lets me connect to Amazon S3 and\n\n99\n00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:49,840\nGoogle Drive and\nother file systems that are out there and\n\n100\n00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,220\nmount them as folders or\ndrives on my system.\n\n101\n00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:56,300\nSo you can always expand\nthe functionality of MacOS if you want.\n\n102\n00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:59,930\nBut native, built right in here,\nyou've got a lot of functionality.\n\n103\n00:06:01,012 --> 00:06:05,200\nAll right, so let's say that we\nwant to share some data, and\n\n104\n00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,890\nlet's just do between Macs to start.\n\n105\n00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:09,180\nWe'll do Windows later.\n\n106\n00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:13,880\nSo if I want to share data between\nMacs I need to pick which Mac\n\n107\n00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:18,130\nhas the files I want to share, so\nsomebody is holding onto that data, and\n\n108\n00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:20,190\nthat might be a file server.\n\n109\n00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:24,010\nI might actually have a Mac that's\ndedicated to be my file server, or\n\n110\n00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:26,150\nit might just be somebody's work station.\n\n111\n00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:29,810\nSo let's go at it from the perspective\nof just a regular Joe shmoe user.\n\n112\n00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:34,900\nSo on this client right here,\nI am just a regular Joe Schmo user.\n\n113\n00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:35,960\nSo I'm just Don Pizet.\n\n114\n00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,720\nI'm logged in.\n\n115\n00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:40,520\nI want to share some data,\nsome data that I have.\n\n116\n00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:44,790\nWell the easiest way to do it\nis to use personal file sharing.\n\n117\n00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:48,030\nPersonal file sharing is one\nof the most simple methods.\n\n118\n00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:52,390\nEvery user has a folder that's a part\nof their home directory called\n\n119\n00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:54,030\nPublic files, all right?\n\n120\n00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:56,970\nAnd this is where we can put files,\nand quickly share them out so\n\n121\n00:06:56,970 --> 00:06:58,820\nother people can access them.\n\n122\n00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:03,330\nIf you've never seen it, you can just\ngo up to your Go menu in the Finder and\n\n123\n00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:06,950\nchoose to go into your Home directory,\nright here.\n\n124\n00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:11,523\nSo I'm going to go Home, and\nin my Home Directory I see my Desktop,\n\n125\n00:07:11,523 --> 00:07:14,230\nmy Documents, my Downloads.\n\n126\n00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:16,840\nAnd this folder right here, public.\n\n127\n00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:17,570\nAll right?\n\n128\n00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:20,070\nNow, when I go into public,\nthere's not much in there by default.\n\n129\n00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:22,210\nLooks like I've got my drop box.\n\n130\n00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:26,930\nBut, and that's not Dropbox the website,\nit's drop box as in, this is\n\n131\n00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:30,500\na folder people will be able to put things\nin but not actually be able to get at.\n\n132\n00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,290\nWe'll talk about that later.\n\n133\n00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:34,150\nBut basically I could\nstart to put files and\n\n134\n00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:38,820\nfolders in here and\ngive other people access to them, right?\n\n135\n00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:45,320\nSo, you know, I could have, you know,\nmaybe, I'll create a public music folder.\n\n136\n00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,860\nAnd so I can put some MP3s in there and\n\n137\n00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,086\nother people can browse in and\naccess them.\n\n138\n00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:52,300\nWell just having the folder is not enough.\n\n139\n00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:54,106\nI actually need to turn on file sharing.\n\n140\n00:07:54,106 --> 00:07:56,972\nAnd file sharing is not\nturned on by default.\n\n141\n00:07:56,972 --> 00:08:01,163\nSo I would need to go up here\ninto my system preferences.\n\n142\n00:08:01,163 --> 00:08:04,940\nAnd go into the sharing system preference.\n\n143\n00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:07,440\nAnd from here you'll see a bunch of\ndifferent things that we can share.\n\n144\n00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,660\nThe one I wantt is file sharing.\n\n145\n00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:12,340\nAnd see how it's not checked by default?\n\n146\n00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:13,890\nWell I'm not going to check it just yet.\n\n147\n00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:16,550\nBecause I want to point out\nsome of these defaults.\n\n148\n00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:20,530\nNotice that when I click on file\nsharing I can see my shared files.\n\n149\n00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:25,790\nAnd by default I've got Don Pezet's\npublic folder, help desk's public folder.\n\n150\n00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:29,570\nI have two user accounts on this machine,\nDon Pezet and help desk.\n\n151\n00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:31,740\nIf I had five I'd see all five of them.\n\n152\n00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:36,320\nWhen we turn file sharing on the default\nis to enable it for our public folders,\n\n153\n00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,552\nthat's the personal file sharing.\n\n154\n00:08:38,552 --> 00:08:43,290\nAll right, well when we turn that on\nIf you look at the permissions that\n\n155\n00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:45,630\nare assigned and,\napparently I can't resize that window.\n\n156\n00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:47,380\nAll right well, when we turn it on,\n\n157\n00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:50,950\nif you look at the permissions that\nare being assigned, Don Pezet,\n\n158\n00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:54,660\non the Don Pezet folder here I'll have\nread and write, I can do whatever I want.\n\n159\n00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:57,690\nBut everyone else will have read only.\n\n160\n00:08:57,690 --> 00:08:59,580\nSo when you turn on file sharing,\n\n161\n00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:02,260\nall you have to do is come in here and\ncheck this little box.\n\n162\n00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:07,610\nAnd automatically,\nyour public folder will be shared out, and\n\n163\n00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:12,870\neveryone can access it, and read, they can\nread the data, they can see your files.\n\n164\n00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:13,840\nThey can't delete them,\n\n165\n00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:18,050\nthey can't change them,\nthey can just see the files, all right?\n\n166\n00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:19,930\nYou on the other hand,\nyou can do whatever you want.\n\n167\n00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:22,550\nYou get read, and write,\nyou can make whatever change you want.\n\n168\n00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,370\nAll right.\n\n169\n00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:26,750\nNow, there's several different\npermissions that we're going to see.\n\n170\n00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:27,980\nAnd I'll talk about them later.\n\n171\n00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:31,930\nBut for right now, these two, read only\nmeans you can just see the files and\n\n172\n00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:35,370\nthat's it, read and\nwrite means you can see the files and\n\n173\n00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:38,210\nyou can delete, change,\nand add more if you want.\n\n174\n00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:39,300\nSo you can actually do quite a bit.\n\n175\n00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:41,320\nAll right.\n\n176\n00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:45,910\nIf I look at help desk, see how, when I'm\non Don Pezet, it shows me as having read\n\n177\n00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:49,450\nand write, but when I click on help desk,\nDon Pezet's no longer listed.\n\n178\n00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:50,530\nNow it's help desk.\n\n179\n00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:51,870\nHelp desk has read and write.\n\n180\n00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:53,875\nEverybody else can only only read.\n\n181\n00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:57,125\nMe if I log in as Dom Pezet, I would\nonly have read access to that folder.\n\n182\n00:09:58,687 --> 00:10:01,366\nAll right,\nnow notice the little note here, it says,\n\n183\n00:10:01,366 --> 00:10:04,221\nother users can access shared\nfolders in this computer and\n\n184\n00:10:04,221 --> 00:10:08,260\nadministrators can access all volumes at,\nand then it tells us where to point to.\n\n185\n00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:14,366\nAnd see how it says AFP://192.68.46.201.\n\n186\n00:10:14,366 --> 00:10:16,840\nThat's the IP address of this machine.\n\n187\n00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:20,000\nAnd AFP, that's Apple file protocol.\n\n188\n00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:25,774\nBut then it says or SMB://192.68.46.201.\n\n189\n00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:29,760\nWhat it did, is it turned on both.\n\n190\n00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,670\nApple file protocol and server message\nlog, it turned on both of them.\n\n191\n00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:37,590\nAnd if we're connecting\nfrom a Mac we'll use AFP,\n\n192\n00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:41,530\nand if we're connecting from\na Window's machine we'll use SMB.\n\n193\n00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:44,780\nSo the support is there,\nit's turned on, and it's ready to rock.\n\n194\n00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:46,580\nAll right.\n\n195\n00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:49,730\nNow If I just wanna do personal\nfile sharing then I'm done.\n\n196\n00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:50,730\nAll I had to do was check that box.\n\n197\n00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:52,270\nAnd that's it.\n\n198\n00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:53,310\nNow I'm done.\n\n199\n00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:57,080\nIf I don't wanna share out help desk's\npublic folder I can just hit the minus\n\n200\n00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,840\nsign to get rid of it.\n\n201\n00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,460\nAnd so we'll bump that one out of there.\n\n202\n00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:03,270\nAnd now I'm just sharing that\nDon Pezet public folder.\n\n203\n00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:05,200\nSo you can manipulate that if you want.\n\n204\n00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,990\nAnd you can change the permissions\ntoo if you wanna change that.\n\n205\n00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:09,060\nYou certainly can.\n\n206\n00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:14,260\nAlso if you hit the options button,\nyou'll see where you can turn on or\n\n207\n00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:16,280\noff SMB or AFP.\n\n208\n00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:20,310\nMaybe you don't want to support Windows,\nand so you can turn of SMB.\n\n209\n00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:23,220\nAnd now, you're just supporting\nconnections from Apple.\n\n210\n00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:25,650\nOr you can do it the other way around and\njust support SMB.\n\n211\n00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:29,900\nApple will do both, so you could\nchoose to go just SMB if you wanted.\n\n212\n00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:30,960\nAll right.\n\n213\n00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,280\nSo we got a couple choices there.\n\n214\n00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:35,120\nI'm going to talk about the Windows\nfile sharing options later, so\n\n215\n00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,529\nlet me just hit done on that for now.\n\n216\n00:11:37,529 --> 00:11:40,950\nBut at a minimum, just to get file sharing\ngoing, we just hit this check mark.\n\n217\n00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:44,140\nAnd once you hit the check mark,\nnow your public folder is shared out.\n\n218\n00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,110\nAll right.\n\n219\n00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:48,390\nSo let's see that in action.\n\n220\n00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:50,670\nNow I can just jump over to another Mac.\n\n221\n00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:52,170\nSo here I am on another Mac.\n\n222\n00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:53,390\nThis is my little server.\n\n223\n00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:59,130\nAnd I can go up here to the go menu,\nand choose connect to server.\n\n224\n00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:03,710\nAnd in the server I can\npunch in the server address,\n\n225\n00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:05,780\nthe address of who it is that\nI'm trying to connect to.\n\n226\n00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:08,620\nAnd, you know it says server,\nit doesn't have to be an actual server,\n\n227\n00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:10,230\nit doesn't have to run the server app.\n\n228\n00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:14,719\nIt can just be a regular workstation, and\nI can punch in AFP, colon, slash, slash.\n\n229\n00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:20,234\nAnd I will punch in the IP\naddress of that system.\n\n230\n00:12:22,335 --> 00:12:27,036\nAnd if you just point to the server's\nIP address itself, you'll try and\n\n231\n00:12:27,036 --> 00:12:28,895\nconnect to that entire box.\n\n232\n00:12:28,895 --> 00:12:31,819\nBut if you know the specific folder\nyou're trying to connect to,\n\n233\n00:12:31,819 --> 00:12:34,810\nyou could punch in the name, and\nI didn't pay attention earlier.\n\n234\n00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:36,140\nIt's just the public folder, but\n\n235\n00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:39,290\nI'll just connect to the actual\nserver name like that.\n\n236\n00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:44,250\nAll right, now when we connect,\nthe default is to connect and\n\n237\n00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:46,550\nthen kinda forget about it\nafter you're connected.\n\n238\n00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:48,570\nBut if this is a server you're\ngonna be connecting to a lot,\n\n239\n00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:50,880\nyou've got a little plus sign right here.\n\n240\n00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,164\nAnd if you hit that plus symbol,\nit'll add it to your favorites so\n\n241\n00:12:54,164 --> 00:12:56,986\nyou can quickly connect to\nit in the future, all right?\n\n242\n00:12:56,986 --> 00:13:01,607\nSo, I'm gonna leave that there and\njust hit connect, and it's gonna try and\n\n243\n00:13:01,607 --> 00:13:02,257\nconnect.\n\n244\n00:13:02,257 --> 00:13:05,411\nNow, if I had a, bound to a directory, and\n\n245\n00:13:05,411 --> 00:13:10,058\nI was logged in with a network account and\nmy network account had\n\n246\n00:13:10,058 --> 00:13:15,870\naccess to the folder I would\nautomatically get access to the folder.\n\n247\n00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:17,700\nBut in my case,\nI don't have a bound account,\n\n248\n00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:21,040\nI'm not bound to a directory so\nI'm logged in with local accounts here.\n\n249\n00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:24,410\nSo when I go to connect it's gonna\nprompt me for a username and password.\n\n250\n00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:26,750\nI need a valid password to connect.\n\n251\n00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:31,800\nWell, if I punch in that Don Pezet\naccount, I'll have read and write access.\n\n252\n00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,940\nIf I plug in any other account,\nbecause it was set to everyone.\n\n253\n00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:37,930\nIf I plug in anybody else,\nI'll just get read only.\n\n254\n00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:41,220\nWell, maybe I wanna connect as Don Pizet,\nso I'll get full access.\n\n255\n00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:43,390\nSo I'll punch in that information.\n\n256\n00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:46,200\nAnd I can choose to save that\npassword in my key chain if I want,\n\n257\n00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,540\nthat way I don't have to\npunch it in every time.\n\n258\n00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:50,820\nBut if this isn't my normal computer\nI might not choose to do that.\n\n259\n00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:52,690\nSo I'll go ahead and connect.\n\n260\n00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:57,870\nNow because I didn't tell it\na specific folder I get a list.\n\n261\n00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:01,470\nNow, Don Pezet's public folder\neverybody see that, right?\n\n262\n00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:04,510\nBecause everyone has access to it,\nat least read.\n\n263\n00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:07,570\nBut I punched in my Don Pezet credentials,\nand\n\n264\n00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:10,080\nDon Pezet is an administrator\non that other machine.\n\n265\n00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:13,120\nSo not only do I see that,\nI see my home folder, and\n\n266\n00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:17,580\nI see the entire hard drive,\nMacintosh HD, that's why I see that.\n\n267\n00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:20,940\nIf I had logged in as just\na regular Joe Schmo user,\n\n268\n00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:24,940\nI would just see Don Pezet's\npublic folder, and that's it.\n\n269\n00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:26,500\nWell that's the one I want\nto connect to anyway, so\n\n270\n00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:29,920\nI'm just gonna choose it and\nhit okay, and now I'm connected.\n\n271\n00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:30,420\nAnd there it is,\n\n272\n00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:35,270\nI can see the Dropbox that was in there\nalready and Public Music is right there.\n\n273\n00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:39,020\nAnd because I have read write access,\nI can go in here and I can create more\n\n274\n00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:43,220\nfolders and do whatever I want, so\nI can create Public Videos, all right.\n\n275\n00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:46,000\nAnd I can start to put things in\nthere because I have that access.\n\n276\n00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,078\nSo I'm on one Mac, but I'm accessing\nfolders across the network on another Mac.\n\n277\n00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:57,480\nNow I used the Go option here and\nConnect to Server, but\n\n278\n00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,797\nyou don't have to go that way.\n\n279\n00:14:59,797 --> 00:15:04,640\nJust inside of your finder, On the left\nside of the screen you'll see the listed\n\n280\n00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:09,485\nhost that it finds out on the network and\nso see I've got like my local devices and\n\n281\n00:15:09,485 --> 00:15:10,954\nthen I've got shared.\n\n282\n00:15:10,954 --> 00:15:15,582\nAnd I can start to see all these other\nsystems that are out there on the network\n\n283\n00:15:15,582 --> 00:15:17,907\nand OSX dash client one is in the list.\n\n284\n00:15:17,907 --> 00:15:20,822\nAnd there I see the different\nsystems that are attached to it.\n\n285\n00:15:20,822 --> 00:15:24,387\nThat's an easier way than using\nthe go menu to type things in it just\n\n286\n00:15:24,387 --> 00:15:25,221\ndiscovers it.\n\n287\n00:15:25,221 --> 00:15:28,710\nThat works out great if all of your\nmachines are on the same network, and\n\n288\n00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:31,910\nif you've got more than one network\nyou'll need to use that go and\n\n289\n00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:33,340\nconnect to server option.\n\n290\n00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:38,057\nSo that's definitely one\nway we can get in there.\n\n291\n00:15:38,057 --> 00:15:39,340\nAll right.\n\n292\n00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:42,400\nSo this is a great example\nof a Mac-to-Mac connection.\n\n293\n00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,900\nWe had that shared folder,\nand we were in business.\n\n294\n00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:47,740\nBut, that was just personal file sharing,\nright.\n\n295\n00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:49,519\nJust turning on that public folder.\n\n296\n00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:52,375\nWhat if I wanna do something\na little more advanced, okay?\n\n297\n00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:56,079\nMaybe I do want to make use of bound\naccounts, and all that good stuff.\n\n298\n00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:59,578\nAnd I want to have some kind of\ncentralized folder that's shared out for\n\n299\n00:15:59,578 --> 00:16:02,210\neverybody to be able to access, all right.\n\n300\n00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:07,050\nWell, I actually kind of have that here\non my, this is my pseudo server, right?\n\n301\n00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:10,500\nSo I have this image storage that\nI used in some of the other shows.\n\n302\n00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,980\nAnd I created a folder\non there called data.\n\n303\n00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:16,150\nAnd in my data folder,\nI've got my employee handbook,\n\n304\n00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:19,830\nmy IT department documents,\nmarketing, sales.\n\n305\n00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:22,980\nIf I go in here I can find,\nhere's my employee handbook.\n\n306\n00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:27,230\nAnd I want to use this as centralized\nstorage for all of my employees.\n\n307\n00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:29,620\nI don't want to have to back up all\nthe clients around the network.\n\n308\n00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:32,750\nI just want to back up this server,\nand that's it, okay.\n\n309\n00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:36,260\nSo I tell all my employees, hey guys, from\nnow on don't save anything to your own\n\n310\n00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:37,980\ncomputer, cuz I'm not gonna back that up.\n\n311\n00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:42,610\nInstead, save all of your work to the\nserver, right here in this data folder.\n\n312\n00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:45,620\nSo you wanna connect to that and\nthat's where you wanna work from.\n\n313\n00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:49,430\nSo if I wanna set something up like that,\nthe process is a little bit different.\n\n314\n00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:52,650\nWhat I have to do is I\nhave to turn on sharing,\n\n315\n00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:55,180\nI'm on a different Mac this time so\nI'll need to turn it on again.\n\n316\n00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:02,550\nSo I'm going to go in here, into Sharing\n> File Sharing and I'm gonna turn it on.\n\n317\n00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:03,591\nNow, since this is a server,\n\n318\n00:17:03,591 --> 00:17:06,670\nI probably don't want to share\nthings like my public folder.\n\n319\n00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:10,210\nSo I'm just gonna remove that and\nget rid of it.\n\n320\n00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:15,450\nSo now file sharing is turned on, but I'm\nnot actually making anything available.\n\n321\n00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:17,820\nAdministrators would be able to\nconnect and see the hard drive,\n\n322\n00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:20,360\nbut regular users would connect and\nsee nothing.\n\n323\n00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:23,730\nSo now I'm gonna add in that data folder.\n\n324\n00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:27,580\nSo I'm gonna hit Add, and\nI'll browse to my Image Storage and\n\n325\n00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:29,980\nthat data folder, and I'm gonna add it in.\n\n326\n00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:31,390\nSo now I've got data.\n\n327\n00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:37,160\nAnd now I can start to customize who\nit is that's going to have access.\n\n328\n00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,770\nSo, see how Help Desk is read and write.\n\n329\n00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:41,710\nI've got this System Group\nthat I'm not really using.\n\n330\n00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:44,470\nAnd I've got the Everyone Group\nwith read only access.\n\n331\n00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:47,030\nWell, I don't want my\nemployees to have read only.\n\n332\n00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:51,020\nI probably need to create a group and\nbe able to manage this better.\n\n333\n00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:54,970\nSo you can use the plus sign here\nto add in additional people.\n\n334\n00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:59,500\nAnd notice it shows not just local users,\nbut network users and groups.\n\n335\n00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,230\nThese are ones that are coming\nfrom the open directory.\n\n336\n00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:05,900\nSo maybe I'm a school.\n\n337\n00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:10,830\nAnd, at my school, I've got teachers, and\nI want the teachers to have access to\n\n338\n00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:12,850\nthis folder, and\nthey need to be able to read and write.\n\n339\n00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:15,800\nThey should be able to store\ntheir own data, and so on.\n\n340\n00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,559\nSo I can go back to my server app.\n\n341\n00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,305\nAnd I've already got\na group called Teachers.\n\n342\n00:18:22,305 --> 00:18:27,100\nAnd in that are all these users,\nTeacher One, Teacher Two, Teacher Three.\n\n343\n00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:32,870\nAnd I want to give teachers the ability\nto write changes into that folder.\n\n344\n00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:36,240\nI want students to be able\nto read stuff from there, so\n\n345\n00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,380\nthey need to be able to see data but\nnot be able to change it.\n\n346\n00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:42,330\nSo maybe this like lesson plans or\nsomething of that nature.\n\n347\n00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:44,020\nSo, I want the students\nto be able to see it.\n\n348\n00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:46,270\nI want the teachers to\nbe able to change it.\n\n349\n00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:48,469\nSo, I can go back to my sharing screen.\n\n350\n00:18:50,745 --> 00:18:51,930\nHere.\n\n351\n00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:54,740\nAnd I've got data in the list,\nand I'm gonna add in,\n\n352\n00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:58,590\nand I'll go to Network Groups > Teachers.\n\n353\n00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:02,130\nAnd then I'll do the same\nthing a second time,\n\n354\n00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:04,080\nI'll go to Network Groups > Students.\n\n355\n00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:10,610\nAnd I'm gonna remove the other entries in\nhere, like System Group I'm not gonna use,\n\n356\n00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:13,560\nand Everyone,\nI don't want everyone to have access.\n\n357\n00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:16,440\nBut notice I can't remove Everyone.\n\n358\n00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,810\nI don't have that minus.\n\n359\n00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:22,250\nEveryone is always there, so all you\ncan do is go over to Permissions and\n\n360\n00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:25,230\nchange it to No Access.\n\n361\n00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:26,920\nThat's the only time you see No Access.\n\n362\n00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:30,740\nThe other ones don't have No Access\nbecause, well, you can just remove them.\n\n363\n00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:32,900\nYou highlight and\nhit the minus button and they're gone.\n\n364\n00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:35,740\nBut Everyone,\nEveryone has that No Access option.\n\n365\n00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:40,780\nSo, I can choose that, I've got\nEveryone in my list now as No Access.\n\n366\n00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,800\nTeachers, well, they're set to read only.\n\n367\n00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,900\nI'm gonna change that to read and write.\n\n368\n00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:48,550\nAnd then Students,\nI'll leave them at read only.\n\n369\n00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:52,340\nThey can see what's there, but\nthey can't change anything.\n\n370\n00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:56,780\nAll right, so that's a pretty good\nsetup right there for my data folder.\n\n371\n00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:00,510\nSo I've got that set,\nI've got everything in place.\n\n372\n00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:03,950\nI'll go ahead and just close out of that,\nand take a look at my client.\n\n373\n00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:06,720\nNow my client,\nI'm logged in as a local user, so\n\n374\n00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,410\nlet me log in as one of\nthose network accounts.\n\n375\n00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:10,810\nI'm gonna log out as me.\n\n376\n00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,861\nAnd I'll log in as one of the teachers.\n\n377\n00:20:15,869 --> 00:20:17,042\nEventually.\n\n378\n00:20:17,042 --> 00:20:18,946\nSo [LAUGH] I'm gonna log in as a teacher.\n\n379\n00:20:18,946 --> 00:20:23,684\nNow when I'm logged in as a teacher\nI'll have the ability to connect to\n\n380\n00:20:23,684 --> 00:20:24,902\nthat file share.\n\n381\n00:20:24,902 --> 00:20:27,937\nAnd, once I'm connected to the file\nshare I'll be able to, well,\n\n382\n00:20:27,937 --> 00:20:31,206\nhopefully create data inside of it,\nI should have/read write access.\n\n383\n00:20:31,206 --> 00:20:32,970\nSo I'm gonna login as teacher one.\n\n384\n00:20:36,627 --> 00:20:40,590\nAll right, so here I am, I'm logged in.\n\n385\n00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:42,560\nNeeds to repair my library.\n\n386\n00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:46,254\nAll right, well, apparently I shut down\nthe machine inappropriately earlier or\n\n387\n00:20:46,254 --> 00:20:48,520\nsomething, so we'll let it do its thing.\n\n388\n00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:52,340\nBut I can just jump into my finder,\nall right?\n\n389\n00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:53,727\nAnd if I'm patient.\n\n390\n00:20:55,364 --> 00:20:57,604\nApparently I've done\nsomething to this machine.\n\n391\n00:21:02,585 --> 00:21:05,473\nAll right, well, so\nif I'm patient over here it will\n\n392\n00:21:05,473 --> 00:21:08,950\neventually discover the network\nresources that are out there.\n\n393\n00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:11,450\nThis is the first time that Teacher One\nhas logged in on this machine so\n\n394\n00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:13,920\nit hasn't done it yet,\nit doesn't have any cached entries.\n\n395\n00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:17,940\nSo I can wait for it or I can just go\nup here to Go > Connect to Server and\n\n396\n00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:20,030\nkind of force it along,\nwhich is what I'm gonna do.\n\n397\n00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:23,800\nSo I'm gonna connect via\nApple File Protocol to my server.\n\n398\n00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:27,570\nNow my server, I know on the screens it\nsays you need to type the IP address,\n\n399\n00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:30,040\nbut you can actually type\nthe name if you know it.\n\n400\n00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:33,395\nSo I'm gonna type in OSX-serverone.local,\nand\n\n401\n00:21:33,395 --> 00:21:36,990\nI want to connect to data,\nthat folder specifically.\n\n402\n00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:40,632\nSo I'm going to go ahead and connect.\n\n403\n00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:43,540\nIt found it, it's just prompting for\nmy password.\n\n404\n00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:46,330\nAnd I'm gonna tell it to\nremember my password.\n\n405\n00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:47,830\nAnd I'll connect.\n\n406\n00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:48,960\nAnd there we go.\n\n407\n00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,170\nI'm connected up.\n\n408\n00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:51,560\nI see the server.\n\n409\n00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,870\nAnd here's the files\nthat are inside of it.\n\n410\n00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:58,470\nAnd now I can go in and, maybe I create\na new folder called lesson plans.\n\n411\n00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:02,033\nAnd I start to put my\nlesson plans in there.\n\n412\n00:22:02,033 --> 00:22:04,650\nHere, maybe I'll, let's see.\n\n413\n00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:07,870\nI don't have permission to see its,\noh, shoot.\n\n414\n00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:10,460\nBecause I used a directory account,\nthere's actually some file permissions\n\n415\n00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:13,410\nthat need to be tweaked a bit,\nwhich I have not done.\n\n416\n00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:16,310\nSo, I'll need to fix that.\n\n417\n00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:18,360\nWhen we're dealing with local accounts,\n\n418\n00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:21,980\nlocal accounts will have the access by\ndefault so we don't have to sweat it much.\n\n419\n00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:26,080\nBut with a directory account like this,\nif I go to the server and\n\n420\n00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:31,500\nI browse to my data folder,\nthat data folder right here, it's shared.\n\n421\n00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:36,180\nBut these files have permissions here\ninside of the Unix operating system,\n\n422\n00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:39,110\nin the BSD that's under the hood\nthat's stopping access.\n\n423\n00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:45,346\nAnd so we have to kind of tweak\nthat a little bit to get access.\n\n424\n00:22:45,346 --> 00:22:50,700\nNotice down here, oh, shoot,\nis it not gonna show it for me?\n\n425\n00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,880\nActually, you know what,\nit is saying that it's set.\n\n426\n00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:55,912\nTeachers have read and write.\n\n427\n00:22:58,698 --> 00:22:59,198\nHm.\n\n428\n00:23:07,277 --> 00:23:09,415\nLet me see if I can square\nthis away real quick.\n\n429\n00:23:09,415 --> 00:23:11,285\nThe permissions were set right.\n\n430\n00:23:11,285 --> 00:23:14,415\nI'm kind of curious why that didn't work.\n\n431\n00:23:18,072 --> 00:23:20,275\nI'm just double checking\nmy permissions here.\n\n432\n00:23:20,275 --> 00:23:22,945\nOn any of these,\nif you ever want to view the permissions,\n\n433\n00:23:22,945 --> 00:23:27,240\nyou can just take a folder and\nyou can Cmd+I is what I'm doing, but\n\n434\n00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:31,490\nyou can right-click and choose Get Info,\nwhatever method is easiest for you.\n\n435\n00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:34,850\nAnd down at the very bottom,\nyou'll see Sharing and Permissions.\n\n436\n00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:37,774\nAnd if you expand that out,\nyou can see what permissions are assigned.\n\n437\n00:23:37,774 --> 00:23:42,092\nAnd that's important because as you browse\ninto folders, you can change permission at\n\n438\n00:23:42,092 --> 00:23:45,372\neach folder level if you want,\nit can create kind of a complexity.\n\n439\n00:23:45,372 --> 00:23:49,331\nAnd when you look, what you should see\nare those sharing permissions assigned.\n\n440\n00:23:49,331 --> 00:23:51,676\nSo I can see teachers have read and write.\n\n441\n00:23:51,676 --> 00:23:56,134\nAnd everyone has no access and students\nare not populating right it's fetching, so\n\n442\n00:23:56,134 --> 00:23:59,440\nthere's something going on, on my system.\n\n443\n00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,140\nBut it's trying to retrieve it there.\n\n444\n00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:03,520\nSo, it looks like my\npermissions are right,\n\n445\n00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,000\nlet me go back here and try this again.\n\n446\n00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:12,230\nYes, now it's working, all right.\n\n447\n00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:16,710\nSo the only thing I did, let me show you\nguys what I did there is, it's sometimes\n\n448\n00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:21,090\nhappens where the permissions don't\nget properly reset on the subfolders.\n\n449\n00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:26,030\nAnd so what I did is I went up to\nthe parent folder, up here to data.\n\n450\n00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:28,700\nAnd I took that parent folder and\nI did a little get info,\n\n451\n00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:31,230\nand pulled up the sharing and\npermissions, and\n\n452\n00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:35,890\nI saw the permissions were right, but then\nif you hit the little gear at the bottom.\n\n453\n00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:37,580\nAnd I had to unlock to do it.\n\n454\n00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:40,520\nSee this apply to\nan enclosed items option?\n\n455\n00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,060\nThat's what I hit that fixed the problem.\n\n456\n00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:46,220\nAnd what that does is it says,\ntake the permissions on this object.\n\n457\n00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:47,770\nThese permissions right here.\n\n458\n00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:52,030\nAnd apply them to everything in\nthe folder and so it went through and\n\n459\n00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:55,560\nit reset the permissions on all\nthe stuff inside of the folder.\n\n460\n00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:59,190\nSo for some reason, those didn't' get set,\nthis kind of forced it along.\n\n461\n00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:00,520\nYou shouldn't have to do that.\n\n462\n00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:03,120\nI'm not sure why mine didn't set there.\n\n463\n00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,950\nI'm on a virtual machine so\nmaybe some squarely happened.\n\n464\n00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:09,450\nBut that reset the permissions and did\nit across everything that was in there.\n\n465\n00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:13,040\nSo that teacher over here who couldn't\naccess the folder a moment ago,\n\n466\n00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,170\nnow they can.\n\n467\n00:25:14,170 --> 00:25:16,230\nNow they can browse right in there and\nthey see the data.\n\n468\n00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:19,330\nYou know,\nI've got these little red circles on,\n\n469\n00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:21,220\nthat are telling me I don't have access.\n\n470\n00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:26,440\nWell that screen just needs to refresh and\nyou can just do cmd+R.\n\n471\n00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:29,740\nWell, normally you can do cmd auto refresh\nthat and get it to update that, but\n\n472\n00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:31,750\nit'll update on its own eventually.\n\n473\n00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:35,770\nAnd when it does,\nthose little circles will go away.\n\n474\n00:25:35,770 --> 00:25:39,365\nBut I can go in here and I can see\nthe data, I just wanted to copy that and\n\n475\n00:25:39,365 --> 00:25:44,710\nappoint him, that's all I wanted to do,\nand stick that in my lesson plan.\n\n476\n00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:48,650\nSo, I have read and write access, so\nI can get in and make these changes.\n\n477\n00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:56,410\nAnd [LAUGH]\napparently right clicking, there we go.\n\n478\n00:25:56,410 --> 00:26:00,490\nSo I can make whatever changes I want in\nhere and do whatever it is I need to do\n\n479\n00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:03,910\non this file to get things\nworking the way that I want.\n\n480\n00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:08,210\nAs a student, I'll have access to\nthis also but just read access.\n\n481\n00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:12,580\nSo if I log out and\nlog back in as a student.\n\n482\n00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:15,200\nI should be able to connect\nthe same exact way I just did,\n\n483\n00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:18,140\nexcept when I connect,\nI'll have read access.\n\n484\n00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:22,490\nSo, let me give it a second while it\nlogs out and is thinking about it.\n\n485\n00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:25,990\nAnd then I've got to wait for\nmy other two up here.\n\n486\n00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:28,030\nThis is my patience shortage day.\n\n487\n00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:29,970\nMondays are always my impatient days.\n\n488\n00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:31,900\nSo, all right, so I'm going to\nlogin as one of those students.\n\n489\n00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:35,100\nI'll login in as student3.\n\n490\n00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:37,650\nAnd so I'm getting logged in, I've never\nlogged into student three before, so\n\n491\n00:26:37,650 --> 00:26:39,650\nI might see a registration screen.\n\n492\n00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:41,160\nOr I might not.\n\n493\n00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,230\nThere we go.\n\n494\n00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:46,918\nAll right, so\nI'm going to connect to that server.\n\n495\n00:26:46,918 --> 00:26:53,730\nAnd I'll just punch in the server.\n\n496\n00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:56,370\nSo, afp:// and then maybe I'll\ndo the IP address this time.\n\n497\n00:26:56,370 --> 00:26:57,920\nI did the name last time.\n\n498\n00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:03,303\nAll right, so I'm going to go ahead and\nconnect to that one, and\n\n499\n00:27:03,303 --> 00:27:06,426\nI'll add it to my favorites, because\nyou know I'm going to connect a lot, so\n\n500\n00:27:06,426 --> 00:27:08,510\nI want to remember this one.\n\n501\n00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:11,460\nAnd I'll get connected,\npunch in my password, and\n\n502\n00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:13,470\nI'll tell it to remember it, so\nI don't have to do that every time.\n\n503\n00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:15,080\nAnd there we go.\n\n504\n00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:19,410\nSo now I've got access, now I do only\nhave read access, and that's it.\n\n505\n00:27:19,410 --> 00:27:21,580\nSo I can't go in here and change things.\n\n506\n00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:26,730\nIf I go into this lesson plan, and I open\nit up, right, it'll take me in here,\n\n507\n00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:32,150\nhere it is, and before the show I grabbed\nthe text of 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea,\n\n508\n00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:36,620\nso here it is, I can see the lesson plan,\nso if I try and\n\n509\n00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:39,360\nmake changes, See this warning?\n\n510\n00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:43,590\nYou don't own the file Employee Handbook\nand don't have permission to write to it.\n\n511\n00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:46,010\nYou can duplicate it and\nedit the duplicate.\n\n512\n00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:47,900\nOnly the duplicate will\ninclude your changes.\n\n513\n00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:50,955\nSo it sees that I don't\nhave access to save it, and\n\n514\n00:27:50,955 --> 00:27:53,495\nit's stopping me from making a mistake,\nall right?\n\n515\n00:27:53,495 --> 00:27:57,225\nIf I hit Duplicate, it's going to try and\nduplicate it there into the network share,\n\n516\n00:27:57,225 --> 00:27:59,495\nbut I'm not going to have access for\nthat either.\n\n517\n00:27:59,495 --> 00:28:03,445\nAnd so when I go to save this,\nsee how it's switched to Untitled, and\n\n518\n00:28:03,445 --> 00:28:06,395\nI'm going to need to\nsave it somewhere else.\n\n519\n00:28:06,395 --> 00:28:11,260\nIf I try and save it, and put it in\nthat same folder, It won't let me.\n\n520\n00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:14,600\nAnd in fact that folder's not even\nshowing up here for me as an option.\n\n521\n00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,610\nSo I'll have to save it somewhere else.\n\n522\n00:28:16,610 --> 00:28:18,510\nLike into my own documents or whatever.\n\n523\n00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:19,640\nJust because I don't have that access.\n\n524\n00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:27,020\nSo there we have our file access,\nand With Apple File Protocol,\n\n525\n00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:30,190\nit's pretty easy, and\nif I had been more patient, there it is.\n\n526\n00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:33,320\nThe servers will show up,\nand so I can see data, and\n\n527\n00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:37,010\nI have a student folder on that account,\nso it's showing up there too.\n\n528\n00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:40,020\nSo I can see that information get\nconnected and I don't have to do the,\n\n529\n00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:41,640\ngo connect to server.\n\n530\n00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,635\nIf you're a more patient person.\n\n531\n00:28:42,635 --> 00:28:47,990\n[LAUGH] All right, so\nthat is a Mac to Mac connection.\n\n532\n00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:52,340\nI want to take a look at Windows to Mac,\ndoing that kind of connectivity and\n\n533\n00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:56,270\nvice versa, and a few other protocols like\nFTP, I just want to kind of show those and\n\n534\n00:28:56,270 --> 00:28:57,530\nlet you see them.\n\n535\n00:28:57,530 --> 00:28:59,070\nSo we'll do that in the next segment.\n\n536\n00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:01,630\nBut right now is a pretty good\nspot to stop and take a break.\n\n537\n00:29:01,630 --> 00:29:04,418\nSo let's take a pause here,\nwhen we get back,\n\n538\n00:29:04,418 --> 00:29:07,003\nmore connectivity protocols after this.\n\n539\n00:29:07,003 --> 00:29:10,747\n[SOUND] All right,\n\n540\n00:29:10,747 --> 00:29:16,244\nwelcome back everybody.\n\n541\n00:29:16,244 --> 00:29:20,307\nSo before the break I connected\nto a Apple sever, right?\n\n542\n00:29:20,307 --> 00:29:25,480\nSo I went from a Mac to a Mac, now I want\nto go from a Mac to our Windows machine.\n\n543\n00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:29,820\nSo maybe I want to do that same thing,\nI want to have a centralized file share.\n\n544\n00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:33,740\nBut for whatever reason, I don't want that\ncentralize file share to be on the Mac,\n\n545\n00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:35,490\nI want it to be on a Windows machine.\n\n546\n00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:38,400\nSo, maybe we've all ready got\nWindows servers in place, and\n\n547\n00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:41,680\nthat's where our file share is, and I just\nneed my Mac to connect to it, all right?\n\n548\n00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:45,330\nWell, we can do that using SMB or SIFS.\n\n549\n00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:48,950\nSo we would just go up here to Go and\nConnect to Server.\n\n550\n00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:51,680\nAnd we would punch in that other\nhost that we want to connect to.\n\n551\n00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:56,710\nSo I created this same basic data file\nsharer over on a Windows box and so\n\n552\n00:29:56,710 --> 00:30:02,270\nI'm just going to punch in SMB://,\nand then either the IP address or\n\n553\n00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:04,630\nfully qualified name of\nthe machine I want to connect to.\n\n554\n00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:12,338\nSo the machine I want to connect to\nis win-server1.lab.itpro.tv/Data.\n\n555\n00:30:12,338 --> 00:30:14,880\nSo it's a Windows box,\nthat's why I'm putting in smb,\n\n556\n00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:18,810\nand I'll add it to my favorites in\ncase I want to connect to it again.\n\n557\n00:30:18,810 --> 00:30:22,890\nAnd I'll connect, when I go to connect,\nit's going to ask for credentials, for\n\n558\n00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:24,800\nusername and password to connect up.\n\n559\n00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:27,500\nI'm logged in as student3,\nso I can go ahead and\n\n560\n00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:31,400\nprovide that if that account has access or\nI can provide some other account,\n\n561\n00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,710\nwhich I think this account has access,\nlet's give it a shot.\n\n562\n00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:39,380\nThere we go and now I can get in and\nI can access the files.\n\n563\n00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:42,310\nNow, this is just a copy of that one\nthat we saw in the first segment,\n\n564\n00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:43,650\nit's not the same folder.\n\n565\n00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:47,380\nBut this one is hosted over on a Windows\nmachine and I can browse in and\n\n566\n00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:48,540\nwork with it.\n\n567\n00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:52,940\nI don't think I set permissions on this\none so I think I have full control.\n\n568\n00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:57,470\nSo I can go in and make changes\non this one if I remember right.\n\n569\n00:30:57,470 --> 00:30:58,760\nAnd yeah, I sure can.\n\n570\n00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:01,290\nSo yeah, I didn't bother setting\npermissions on the Windows side.\n\n571\n00:31:01,290 --> 00:31:04,350\nSo we can go in there and\n\n572\n00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:08,090\nit's just warning me about not\nhaving permanent version storage.\n\n573\n00:31:08,090 --> 00:31:13,210\nWhen you write to a Mac hard drive\nthat's using the Apple file system,\n\n574\n00:31:13,210 --> 00:31:14,420\nyou can store versions.\n\n575\n00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:17,320\nSo you can store previous versions of\na file if it's been changed a few times,\n\n576\n00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:19,000\nall part of the time machine system.\n\n577\n00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,840\nWell, that doesn't work in Windows, and so\n\n578\n00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:23,010\nit's just warning me that\nI'm not going to have that.\n\n579\n00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:25,510\nSo I just overwrote the employee handbook.\n\n580\n00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:31,520\nSo there we've got that data punched in,\nand now we're connected up and\n\n581\n00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,970\nwe're accessing that Windows machine.\n\n582\n00:31:32,970 --> 00:31:36,180\nAnd I see my Windows server\nover here in the finders also.\n\n583\n00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:38,258\nAnd so,\nI connect into that data folder but\n\n584\n00:31:38,258 --> 00:31:42,153\nthere were other folders on that server I\ncould have connected to if I needed to.\n\n585\n00:31:42,153 --> 00:31:47,160\nSo, connecting to a Windows box,\nnot really any different than\n\n586\n00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:51,812\nconnecting to an Apple box when\nit comes to network access.\n\n587\n00:31:51,812 --> 00:31:53,790\nAll right.\n\n588\n00:31:54,870 --> 00:31:58,540\nSome of the other things that we need to\npay attention to, there's other protocols.\n\n589\n00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:01,280\nOther protocols like FTP,\nI mentioned, right.\n\n590\n00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:04,770\nIf I wanted to connect to an FTP server,\nI could just go up here and choose go,\n\n591\n00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:07,350\nconnect to server, and\npunch in the server.\n\n592\n00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:12,610\nSo I could say FTP:// and\nthe server I wanted to connect to.\n\n593\n00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:14,700\nAll right?\nAnd if I knew the subfolders and\n\n594\n00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:17,140\nall that that I wanted to connect to,\nI could specify that or\n\n595\n00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:17,920\nI could just leave it out.\n\n596\n00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,990\nSo I'll punch that one in and hit connect.\n\n597\n00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:22,800\nIt's going to ask for\na username and password.\n\n598\n00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:25,680\nFor this one,\nI'm going to choose to connect as guest.\n\n599\n00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:28,670\nA lot of FTP servers support\nanonymous access, and so\n\n600\n00:32:28,670 --> 00:32:31,600\nyou don't need to provide a username and\npassword.\n\n601\n00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,610\nSo I'll give that a shot.\n\n602\n00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:33,440\nThere we go.\n\n603\n00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:36,530\nAnd now I've got FTP access\nto that same folder.\n\n604\n00:32:36,530 --> 00:32:40,440\nNow FTP, it can't determine a server name,\nso see how it's got the IP\n\n605\n00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:44,580\naddress shown over here, and\nI'm able to browse in and work with it.\n\n606\n00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:47,300\nOnce I'm connected, it looks\nthe same as any other share folder,\n\n607\n00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:50,780\nit's just using a completely\ndifferent protocol on the back end.\n\n608\n00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:51,370\nAll right.\n\n609\n00:32:51,370 --> 00:32:55,090\nSo that's pretty important, you know, just\nsome of the stuff that's supported there.\n\n610\n00:32:55,090 --> 00:32:57,270\nThere's some other like,\nnon-file transfer stuff.\n\n611\n00:32:57,270 --> 00:33:01,280\nFor example, if you choose to go and\nconnect to server,\n\n612\n00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:04,620\nI've been doing all file protocols, right?\n\n613\n00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:07,950\nThis one's not on the exam, but just so\nyou know, it also supports doing things\n\n614\n00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:13,610\nlike VNC, so I could specify VNC and\nhost that's on the network.\n\n615\n00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:16,290\nNow I got to try and\nthink of some host that I can connect to.\n\n616\n00:33:16,290 --> 00:33:19,660\nLet's try this guy.\n\n617\n00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:22,940\nAnd we can connect in.\n\n618\n00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:24,390\nThis is our director's machine.\n\n619\n00:33:24,390 --> 00:33:25,650\nLet's see what he's doing right now.\n\n620\n00:33:25,650 --> 00:33:27,480\nSo, you can punch it in and\nconnect in and view.\n\n621\n00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:29,930\nOh he's watching the show\nwhat a coincidence.\n\n622\n00:33:29,930 --> 00:33:33,050\nSo we can jump in there and connect in and\nso now I'm viewing another machine.\n\n623\n00:33:33,050 --> 00:33:36,590\nSo that go connect to server option,\nthere's a lot of power in there.\n\n624\n00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:41,118\nA lot of stuff that isn't\njust file All right.\n\n625\n00:33:41,118 --> 00:33:43,050\nLet's see, what else am I leaving out?\n\n626\n00:33:43,050 --> 00:33:44,660\nI feel like I'm leaving\nsomething important out.\n\n627\n00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:45,690\nOh, permissions.\n\n628\n00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:48,440\nI wanted to talk a little\nbit more about permissions.\n\n629\n00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:52,050\nIn the permissions drop down box, there\nwere actually several options in there,\n\n630\n00:33:52,050 --> 00:33:53,280\nand I didn't really talk about them.\n\n631\n00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:56,610\nAnd that was because I wanted to\nwait until now and do it separately.\n\n632\n00:33:56,610 --> 00:33:59,380\nSo in the permissions box,\nwe really have four choices, and\n\n633\n00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:03,300\nI kind of wrote them out here in my little\nnotes, so let me just bring this up.\n\n634\n00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:06,390\nWhen you choose your permissions,\nJason can we bring this up?\n\n635\n00:34:06,390 --> 00:34:07,680\nMy notes?\n\n636\n00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:08,520\nPerfect.\n\n637\n00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:11,317\nSo, he's distracted cause\nI took over his computer.\n\n638\n00:34:11,317 --> 00:34:15,780\nSo [LAUGH] so we look at the permissions,\nthe most common ones are these two\n\n639\n00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:20,020\nin the middle, read and write, and\nread only, those two guys, all right?\n\n640\n00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:21,620\nRead and write just like the name implies.\n\n641\n00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:24,380\nThat means that someone can view\nthe data that's in there, and\n\n642\n00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:26,510\nthey can write changes to it.\n\n643\n00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:28,420\nRead only means they\ncan just see the data.\n\n644\n00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:30,440\nSo those are the two that we normally use.\n\n645\n00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:34,140\nBut there were two others:\nwrite only drop box.\n\n646\n00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:36,400\nThis is a really neat one, all right.\n\n647\n00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:39,260\nIn our public folder,\nwe have a drop box folder by default, and\n\n648\n00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:40,970\nthe permissions are set this way.\n\n649\n00:34:40,970 --> 00:34:44,660\nWith drop box, somebody can write data.\n\n650\n00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:45,840\nBut not read.\n\n651\n00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,280\nAnd that sounds really weird.\n\n652\n00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:50,470\nWhy would I want somebody to be able to\nmake changes but not be able to read?\n\n653\n00:34:50,470 --> 00:34:54,210\nAnd the answer is if we want somebody\nto be able to drop off something,\n\n654\n00:34:54,210 --> 00:34:56,260\na lot of schools make use of this.\n\n655\n00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:58,290\nThey tell their students, all right,\nyou've got a homework assignment.\n\n656\n00:34:58,290 --> 00:34:59,740\nYou've got to write a paper and\n\n657\n00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:02,960\nwhen you're done You've got to\nput it in the drop box, right?\n\n658\n00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:06,460\nAnd once they throw it in there,\nthey can't see what's in there.\n\n659\n00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:08,010\nThey can't see the other students' work.\n\n660\n00:35:08,010 --> 00:35:10,430\nThey can't just go and\ngrab somebody else's work.\n\n661\n00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:13,670\nAnd, once they've dropped it in there,\nthey can't take it back.\n\n662\n00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:16,950\nSo, if they drop it in there and change\ntheir mind about something, too late.\n\n663\n00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:21,154\nNow they'll have to drop in another one,\nand we can look at the time stamps to say\n\n664\n00:35:21,154 --> 00:35:25,300\n\"Oh, they've submitted a change after the\ndeadline, or something of that nature.\" So\n\n665\n00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:28,610\nthat drop box feature's really\nuseful in that type of environment,\n\n666\n00:35:28,610 --> 00:35:29,970\nschools use it a lot.\n\n667\n00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:33,080\nIn businesses you don't see it as much,\nbut it can be useful.\n\n668\n00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:36,030\nAll right, so\nthat's what the write only drop box is.\n\n669\n00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:40,440\nAnd then no access, no access we\nonly see the everyone account, and\n\n670\n00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:43,810\nthat's because you can't remove\nthe everyone account, it's always there.\n\n671\n00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:46,640\nSo it has this one special\nvalue of no access which says,\n\n672\n00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:49,670\nby default nobody has access to this.\n\n673\n00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:53,360\nBut you then override it with\nour specific other entries.\n\n674\n00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,750\nSo that when you add in users and\n\n675\n00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:58,340\ngroups into the list that\noverrides the everyone setting.\n\n676\n00:35:58,340 --> 00:35:59,800\nSo this is just your default permission.\n\n677\n00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:02,410\nAll right.\n\n678\n00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:05,280\nSo those are the four different\npermissions that we set.\n\n679\n00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:08,720\nWe provide them and just keep in\nmind that we do have the permissions\n\n680\n00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:11,550\nin the little sharing\nscreen that we saw earlier.\n\n681\n00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:14,450\nBut then there's the permissions as\nthey're set to the actual files,\n\n682\n00:36:14,450 --> 00:36:18,650\nand normally,they automatically\nget set and it's done for you, but\n\n683\n00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:21,580\nlike you saw with me in that\nfirst segment, I had to go and\n\n684\n00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:23,460\noverride it cause something,\nsomething went wrong.\n\n685\n00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:26,350\nSomething didn't quite apply right,\nall right.\n\n686\n00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:29,990\nBut there are other times you need to go\nto the file system, which is, you know,\n\n687\n00:36:29,990 --> 00:36:32,930\njust to, to kind of use my\nsame example from before,\n\n688\n00:36:32,930 --> 00:36:36,310\nwhen I go up in here\nto system preferences.\n\n689\n00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:38,490\nAnd into sharing.\n\n690\n00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:41,470\nAnd I choose to set up that data share.\n\n691\n00:36:41,470 --> 00:36:46,690\nI set these permissions and it applies to\nthe data folder and everything underneath.\n\n692\n00:36:46,690 --> 00:36:49,960\nIf I want to have custom\npermissions on different folders,\n\n693\n00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,840\nI can't do that from here, all right.\n\n694\n00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:52,840\nThis data folder,\n\n695\n00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:56,140\neverything underneath it is going to\nhave the same set of permissions.\n\n696\n00:36:56,140 --> 00:37:00,330\nSo if I want to customize stuff inside of\nthat, I do have to go to the file system.\n\n697\n00:37:00,330 --> 00:37:03,750\nSo maybe I do want to have\na drop box in here, right?\n\n698\n00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:06,587\nSo I could create a folder\ncalled assignments.\n\n699\n00:37:09,186 --> 00:37:13,280\nThere, and I could set its permissions.\n\n700\n00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,470\nI can do the.\n\n701\n00:37:14,470 --> 00:37:15,780\nGet info.\n\n702\n00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:18,050\nAnd go down here to permissions.\n\n703\n00:37:18,050 --> 00:37:23,780\nAnd I could come in and\nsay everyone gets write only dropbox.\n\n704\n00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:24,400\nAll right.\n\n705\n00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:29,092\nBut then I could come in and\nsay teachers, let me just add teachers.\n\n706\n00:37:32,933 --> 00:37:33,548\nAll right.\n\n707\n00:37:33,548 --> 00:37:39,980\nTeachers get read only or read and\nwrite, whichever one I chose.\n\n708\n00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:44,820\nSo if a teacher connects, they can see\neverything in the assignments folder and\n\n709\n00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:48,235\ndo whatever they want, but\nif a student connects, sure you know.\n\n710\n00:37:48,235 --> 00:37:49,145\nEveryone else.\n\n711\n00:37:49,145 --> 00:37:51,895\nWhen they connect they'll\nsee an empty folder.\n\n712\n00:37:51,895 --> 00:37:55,045\nThey can drag and drop stuff into it,\nor copy and paste stuff into it,\n\n713\n00:37:55,045 --> 00:37:56,845\nand then it'll disappear.\n\n714\n00:37:56,845 --> 00:37:59,855\nSo it's there but\nthey can't see it anymore.\n\n715\n00:37:59,855 --> 00:38:02,797\nBecause they have ability to write and\nthat's it.\n\n716\n00:38:02,797 --> 00:38:06,537\nAll right, so that is the basic\nway we do something like that, and\n\n717\n00:38:06,537 --> 00:38:11,067\nI had to go in here to the file system to\ndo it because otherwise the permissions\n\n718\n00:38:11,067 --> 00:38:15,777\nassigned to the data folder, this folder\nhere, they trickle down to apply to\n\n719\n00:38:15,777 --> 00:38:20,697\nall these folders, and I wanted different\npermissions on this assignments folder, so\n\n720\n00:38:20,697 --> 00:38:22,230\nI had to go to the file system.\n\n721\n00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:23,590\nSo sometimes we got to mix and\n\n722\n00:38:23,590 --> 00:38:27,830\nmatch that sharing system preference\nwith the file system settings.\n\n723\n00:38:29,410 --> 00:38:30,500\nAll right.\n\n724\n00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:31,770\nWhat else do we have?\n\n725\n00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:32,890\nThose are the main ones.\n\n726\n00:38:32,890 --> 00:38:35,220\nI think I've covered\neverything that's on the exam.\n\n727\n00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:36,460\nLet's see.\n\n728\n00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:38,960\nWe just skim over my notes here,\nmake sure I didn't miss anything else.\n\n729\n00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,950\nI think that's basically it.\n\n730\n00:38:40,950 --> 00:38:44,760\nDo keep in mind that people get prompted\nfor credentials when they connect.\n\n731\n00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:45,970\nAnd they can choose to remember it,\n\n732\n00:38:45,970 --> 00:38:48,470\nand then they're not going\nto be prompted every time.\n\n733\n00:38:48,470 --> 00:38:52,280\nAnd you can set up your favorites in\nthat connect to server dialogue so\n\n734\n00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:56,614\nthat you can access them\nagain pretty easily.\n\n735\n00:38:56,614 --> 00:38:58,770\nAll right.\n\n736\n00:38:58,770 --> 00:39:02,440\nOkay, so\nDave made some comments in the chat room.\n\n737\n00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,840\nLet me pull up my chat room.\n\n738\n00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:06,350\nAbout some of the finer details\n\n739\n00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:09,780\nwhen we deal with this because each\nprotocol is a little bit different.\n\n740\n00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:15,210\nSo he's just kind of letting you\nknow if you connect to a server and\n\n741\n00:39:15,210 --> 00:39:18,130\nyou just punch in the IP\nthat it does default to AFP.\n\n742\n00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:23,040\nAnd that's Apple defaulting to Apple which\nis typically what you want if you're\n\n743\n00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:27,390\non a Mac and you can use AFP, you really\nshould because you get better performance.\n\n744\n00:39:27,390 --> 00:39:31,370\nWhen you connect using SMB,\nyou can get degraded performance.\n\n745\n00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:35,130\nAlthough there are security professionals\nout there that'll tell you SMB has some\n\n746\n00:39:35,130 --> 00:39:37,670\nadditional security features\nyou might want to use.\n\n747\n00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:38,750\nI don't trust either of them.\n\n748\n00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:40,230\nSo if you're really\nworried about security,\n\n749\n00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:43,320\nyou really need to look into doing IP sec,\nor something on top of that.\n\n750\n00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:45,990\nAnd then at that point, it really\ndoesn't matter which protocol you use.\n\n751\n00:39:45,990 --> 00:39:47,750\nAll right.\n\n752\n00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:50,670\nBut yes, so just keep in mind\nthere is a lot more to it.\n\n753\n00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:53,160\nThe exam really just touches on\nthat basic connectivity though, so\n\n754\n00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:57,320\nbe aware that you can connect with AFP,\nyou can connect with SMD.\n\n755\n00:39:57,320 --> 00:40:00,110\nIt's a good idea to\nremember the whole list.\n\n756\n00:40:00,110 --> 00:40:04,030\nSo back in my show notes, and\nI'll post these notes with the episode.\n\n757\n00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:07,440\nI made that big list of all\nthe protocols that could be supported.\n\n758\n00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,835\nIt's a good idea to remember those,\n\n759\n00:40:08,835 --> 00:40:12,220\ncause you may see questions on which you\ncan connect to and which you can't, and\n\n760\n00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:15,410\njust to avoid confusion,\nmake sure you remember that SMB and\n\n761\n00:40:15,410 --> 00:40:19,410\nCIPS are really the same thing, so\nYou can kind of use those interchangeably.\n\n762\n00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:24,280\nAll right, well,\nthat's about it for file sharing.\n\n763\n00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:27,500\nSo we've covered user accounts,\nnow we've covered file sharing.\n\n764\n00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:30,530\nSo those are two steps in\ngetting our Macs set up, and\n\n765\n00:40:30,530 --> 00:40:31,990\nin working in network environment.\n\n766\n00:40:31,990 --> 00:40:33,590\nWe've got a lot more to talk about.\n\n767\n00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:36,300\nWe haven't even touched printers and\nsome of the other things.\n\n768\n00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:39,750\nSo look for more episodes coming\nsoon as we move through Through\n\n769\n00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:41,780\nthe rest of those objectives.\n\n770\n00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:44,850\nAll right, but this is a pretty good\nspot for us to wrap this episode up.\n\n771\n00:40:44,850 --> 00:40:49,280\nSo let me just remind you guys,\nif you have any questions on any of this,\n\n772\n00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,380\ncheck out our website.\n\n773\n00:40:50,380

right, good morning,\ngood afternoon and good evening.\n\n5\n00:00:35,921 --> 00:00:38,450\nAnd welcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:39,380\nI'm your host,\n\n7\n00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:44,450\nDon Pezet Back again with another\nepisode of Apple Certified Associate.\n\n8\n00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:46,816\nWe've got a softball episode coming up.\n\n9\n00:00:46,816 --> 00:00:51,170\n[LAUGH] I hate to say, but it is one\nof the easier sections of this exam.\n\n10\n00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:55,090\nWe need to take a look\nat integrating our Mac.\n\n11\n00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:57,930\nWith the various collaboration\nsolutions that are out there.\n\n12\n00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:01,505\nAnd collaboration, that's a really big\nword that just means email and calendars.\n\n13\n00:01:01,505 --> 00:01:04,350\n[LAUGH] And so\nthat's really not a big one,\n\n14\n00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:05,909\nthis should be one of the easier\nsections for you guys.\n\n15\n00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,550\nWhen you use a computer these days,\n\n16\n00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:13,910\nsome of the primary communication methods\nare via the internet or via our network.\n\n17\n00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:16,910\nSo we need to get our system\nset up to handle that.\n\n18\n00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:20,780\nWell your Apple machine comes\nwith the Mac mail client,\n\n19\n00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:23,870\nwhich is actually a really\ngood email client.\n\n20\n00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:27,350\nThere's a ton of e-mail clients that\nare out there like Microsoft Outlook and\n\n21\n00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:31,820\nMozilla Thunderbird,\nI think they still make Eudora,\n\n22\n00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:33,770\nthings like that that you can use.\n\n23\n00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:35,740\nAnd they're decent,\nsome are better than others.\n\n24\n00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:38,970\nThe mail client in Mac OS is\nactually pretty sharp, and\n\n25\n00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:41,010\na lot of people make use of it.\n\n26\n00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:42,030\nIt's good.\n\n27\n00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:46,470\nWell, fortunately, it supports connecting\nto all sorts different systems for\n\n28\n00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:51,370\ngetting your e-mail, your calendars,\nyour contacts you know,\n\n29\n00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:54,220\njust all of the various things that\nyou need to work with on a given day.\n\n30\n00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:56,190\nSo how do we get that set up?\n\n31\n00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:59,120\nWell, it's pretty straightforward\nbecause Apple has made it easy for us.\n\n32\n00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:02,510\nThey took all the major providers for\ncollaboration and\n\n33\n00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:04,130\nthey kind of pre built a wizard for us.\n\n34\n00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:04,839\nLet me show you what I mean.\n\n35\n00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,710\nAlright so here's my Mac, and this is,\n\n36\n00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:11,540\nit's not a fresh install anymore because\nwe've been using it here in the episodes.\n\n37\n00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:14,100\nBut you guys have seen I haven't\ninstalled anything on here so\n\n38\n00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,740\nthis is pretty much stock.\n\n39\n00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:18,960\nAnd if you look, you have that\nMac mail client right down here.\n\n40\n00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:22,450\nYou also have your contacts and\nyour calendar.\n\n41\n00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:23,800\nNow, by default,\n\n42\n00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:29,060\nwhen I fire these things up like if I fire\nup the calendar It's pretty much empty.\n\n43\n00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:31,220\nIt's got US holidays\nbecause I'm in the US,\n\n44\n00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:32,490\nbut other than that\nit's pretty much empty.\n\n45\n00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:36,510\nAnd the reason is, I haven't\nconnected it to any external sources.\n\n46\n00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:41,210\nIt's just connected right here to my Mac,\nit's own little local instance.\n\n47\n00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:42,710\nAnd if I look at some of the other ones,\n\n48\n00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:45,830\nlike my contacts I'm not going to have\na whole heck of a lot of in here either.\n\n49\n00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:48,840\nI've got Apple Incorporated and\nthat's it, right?\n\n50\n00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,310\nAgain, because it's just pulling from\nmy local database and that's it.\n\n51\n00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:57,430\nAnd if I got to mail, when I fire up\nmy email client, it's not set up for\n\n52\n00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:59,880\nanything and so it's going to\nask me who I want to connect to.\n\n53\n00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,490\nNow I'm going to cancel that for\nright now and\n\n54\n00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:04,778\njust get out of that because on the exam\nyou're not going to see that way.\n\n55\n00:03:04,778 --> 00:03:06,430\nYou're going to see the way\nthat they're configuring it\n\n56\n00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:07,720\nthrough the system preferences.\n\n57\n00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,770\nSo if we go into our system preferences.\n\n58\n00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:13,790\nI'll just go to my Apple menu and\nthe system preferences.\n\n59\n00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:16,920\nWe'll see in here Internet accounts.\n\n60\n00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:20,620\nIt's right here, net to iCloud and\nyour network settings.\n\n61\n00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:22,090\nSo internet accounts.\n\n62\n00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:24,350\nNow why did they give\nit such a generic name?\n\n63\n00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:24,890\nInternet account.\n\n64\n00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:26,980\nYou don't, you don't need\nan account to use the internet.\n\n65\n00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:28,260\nWell these are just accounts for\n\n66\n00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:30,990\nservices that we might be\naccessing via the internet.\n\n67\n00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:34,250\nEmail is the most common,\nbut calendar, contacts,\n\n68\n00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:35,600\nand the other ones are in there too.\n\n69\n00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:39,500\nNow, when you launch Internet accounts,\nit'll show any accounts you've\n\n70\n00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:42,600\ncurrently got set up, and on a new\nmachine you're not going to have any.\n\n71\n00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:46,265\nAnd then on the right side you'll see\nall the ones that we can add, right?\n\n72\n00:03:46,265 --> 00:03:49,955\nA lot of you guys will have all ready\nadded iCloud because iCloud is the service\n\n73\n00:03:49,955 --> 00:03:53,095\nthat allows you to back up a lot\nof your information from your Mac\n\n74\n00:03:53,095 --> 00:03:54,915\nto the Apple Cloud.\n\n75\n00:03:54,915 --> 00:03:57,175\nAnd if you have more than one machine,\nit synchronizes it and\n\n76\n00:03:57,175 --> 00:03:58,780\nif you lose your first machine.\n\n77\n00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,070\nYou've always got your data backed up.\n\n78\n00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:03,920\nSo really valuable resource, so\na lot of people already have that, right?\n\n79\n00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,550\nBut iCloud itself,\ndoesn't let you send emails,\n\n80\n00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:09,510\ndoesn't let you send\ncommunications like that.\n\n81\n00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:11,600\nIt does messaging, but that's about it.\n\n82\n00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,310\nAnd we cover messaging in another section,\nalright?\n\n83\n00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:19,880\nBut these other ones Microsoft Exchange,\nGoogle, Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn.\n\n84\n00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:24,870\nThese are all other services that allow us\nto collaborate and exchange information.\n\n85\n00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:28,200\nNow on the exam they're not going\nto delve into social media, so\n\n86\n00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,300\nyou're not going to see Twitter,\nFacebook, LinkedIn.\n\n87\n00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:34,140\nThey're focused on mail,\ncalendars, contacts.\n\n88\n00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:36,290\nRight, in fact,\nthat's the name of this section.\n\n89\n00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:39,310\nEmail, calendars and contacts,\nI just looked in the book.\n\n90\n00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:43,040\nSo that's really what we need to focus on.\n\n91\n00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,600\nIn the business world,\none of the most common platforms for\n\n92\n00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,640\nthat is Microsoft Exchange.\n\n93\n00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:51,660\nAnd so you'll see that's the second\noption, right after iCloud.\n\n94\n00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:54,750\nSo Microsoft Exchange, we can connect\nup to one of their servers and\n\n95\n00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:57,730\nwe can get email, contacts, calendar.\n\n96\n00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:00,500\nAll synchronized at that central server,\nall right?\n\n97\n00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,530\nDoesn't mean you have to use exchange,\nthough.\n\n98\n00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:03,890\nA lot of businesses do.\n\n99\n00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:08,600\nMany businesses, like us, ITProTV,\nwe actually use Google Apps, so we have\n\n100\n00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:13,790\na Google Apps account, and that's what\nhandles our email, calendar, and contacts.\n\n101\n00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:17,830\nSo all the employees here have accounts\nthere, and we log in and synchronize, and\n\n102\n00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:20,410\nso you can pull right from\nthere if you want, all right?\n\n103\n00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:23,840\nSo if you've got one of those two systems,\nit's really easy.\n\n104\n00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:27,520\nIt sets up all of those services at once,\nright?\n\n105\n00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,310\nIf you've got something else.\n\n106\n00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:31,860\nIf you have something that's\nnot here in the list.\n\n107\n00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:32,640\nDon't worry.\n\n108\n00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:35,580\nAll the way at the bottom\nyou have add other account.\n\n109\n00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:38,130\nAnd you can add one in and\nmanually give the settings.\n\n110\n00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:41,180\nSo you can connect to any\nsystem that you want, right.\n\n111\n00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:43,890\nLet's start by looking at some\nof the more automatic ones.\n\n112\n00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:45,750\nGoogle is probably the easiest one right?\n\n113\n00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:50,370\nBecause with Google, you just punch\nin your email address and password.\n\n114\n00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:54,930\nThe Apple account will reach out,\nconnect to your account and\n\n115\n00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:56,560\nset up everything for\nyou to be ale to communicate.\n\n116\n00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,400\nIt's really straight forward and\nreally easy.\n\n117\n00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:03,000\nWith Microsoft exchange,\nit can be easy, but\n\n118\n00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000\nit can also be a little\nbit more difficult.\n\n119\n00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,480\nMicrosoft Exchange Server supports\nsomething called auto configure or\n\n120\n00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:12,115\nauto detect, you'll hear different names\nfor it, where it's a lot like Gmail.\n\n121\n00:06:12,115 --> 00:06:16,115\nYou punch in your email address and\npassword, it'll go out and find you and\n\n122\n00:06:16,115 --> 00:06:18,804\nget you connected and get you set up.\n\n123\n00:06:18,804 --> 00:06:23,367\nBut not every Exchange server is set up\nfor that, so if it fails, then it's going\n\n124\n00:06:23,367 --> 00:06:27,660\nto start asking you questions about\nwhat the server is and so on.\n\n125\n00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:31,290\nSo you'll have provide that additional\ninformation to get it to connect.\n\n126\n00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:36,280\nSo for example, if I say,\nwell here it's got student3 and\n\n127\n00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:41,230\nI put in an email address\nof student3@lab.itpro.tv,\n\n128\n00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:43,810\nand I put in a password.\n\n129\n00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:47,840\nLike this, and I hit continue,\nit's going to reach out, and\n\n130\n00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,250\nit's trying to connect to a server.\n\n131\n00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:52,580\nHere it's warning me that the certificate\nfor that server is not trusted.\n\n132\n00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:53,800\nSo, it did find that server,\n\n133\n00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,600\nI'm just going to trust that\ncertificate real quick.\n\n134\n00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,880\nAnd so it's going to reach\nout to that server now.\n\n135\n00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,710\nNow this student doesn't actually\nhave an account on that server, and\n\n136\n00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:07,380\nyou know I thought it would give\nme the manual option here but\n\n137\n00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:10,440\nit would help if I put\nin the right password.\n\n138\n00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,870\nThere we go.\n\n139\n00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:15,670\nSo if it reaches out to the server and\nit can't figure out things on it's own.\n\n140\n00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:19,750\nThen you'll see a screen like this where\nyou can punch in some basic information\n\n141\n00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:22,400\nincluding the server address.\n\n142\n00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,970\nSo with Google,\nit always knows the servers, right?\n\n143\n00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:26,230\nThey're Google servers.\n\n144\n00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:28,950\nBut with Microsoft Exchange,\nyou're probably running your\n\n145\n00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:32,170\nown Exchange servers and so\nit doesn't know the server name.\n\n146\n00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:33,910\nAnd so you've got to punch that in so\n\n147\n00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:36,650\nyou might see a more\ndetailed screen like this.\n\n148\n00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:40,490\nIf your IT admins have not\nset up auto detect properly.\n\n149\n00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:44,310\nIf auto detect is properly\nset up like in my case.\n\n150\n00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:48,699\nIf I add Don Pizet and\nmy email address is,\n\n151\n00:07:48,699 --> 00:07:56,210\nI think it's dpizet@lab.itpro.tv,\nAll right.\n\n152\n00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:59,053\nSo if I punch that it,\nit's going to reach out, and\n\n153\n00:07:59,053 --> 00:08:01,250\nit's going to connect to that server.\n\n154\n00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:03,920\nIt should find my information, and\nit shouldn't ask me anything else.\n\n155\n00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,960\nIt connects right up.\n\n156\n00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,630\nAnd sets me up.\n\n157\n00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:09,961\nNow, when I say it sets me up,\nit's setting up my email, my contacts and\n\n158\n00:08:09,961 --> 00:08:11,150\nmy calendar.\n\n159\n00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:14,380\nAnd it's synchronizing them\nall with the Exchange server.\n\n160\n00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:17,270\nSo it's just giving me a note here\nthat it was able to connect, and\n\n161\n00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:17,990\nI can hit continue.\n\n162\n00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:22,400\nAnd now it's letting me pick mail,\ncontacts, calendar.\n\n163\n00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,090\nIf I don't want one,\nI can uncheck it and turn it off.\n\n164\n00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:28,460\nYou'll see it's also getting notes and\nreminders, which are a good idea.\n\n165\n00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:31,450\nYou may or may not actually use\nthe note system in Exchange.\n\n166\n00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:34,380\nYou know you've got your own\nlocal note system right here, but\n\n167\n00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,740\nit's gonna connect those two.\n\n168\n00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:38,045\nSo now when you make a note\nhere on your Apple device,\n\n169\n00:08:38,045 --> 00:08:40,690\nit'll synchronize that up to the server.\n\n170\n00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:42,980\nNice thing there,\nif you lose your Apple device,\n\n171\n00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:45,830\nall of your information is backed up there\non the exchange server, so pretty useful.\n\n172\n00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:49,110\nAll right,\nI'm gonna go ahead and hit done.\n\n173\n00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:50,160\nAnd let that connect up.\n\n174\n00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,930\nSo there it goes, Exchange and\nit's connecting up, it's synchronizing.\n\n175\n00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:56,490\nI'm just gonna let it finish\nits initial synchronization and\n\n176\n00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:58,640\nnow I've got it in place.\n\n177\n00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,060\nNow, when I go fire up\nthose apps from earlier.\n\n178\n00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:02,430\nLike if I fire up my calendar,\n\n179\n00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,930\nyou know I really should have\nused a trusted certificate.\n\n180\n00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:08,850\nWhen you connect to an Exchange server,\n\n181\n00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:13,570\nthe certificate that it uses,\nit's using that to encrypt everything.\n\n182\n00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:17,050\nYou build an SSL session and\nif you don't trust the certificate,\n\n183\n00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:18,850\nyou'll get warnings like this every time.\n\n184\n00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:21,070\nIf you trust it,\nthat'll solve that problem.\n\n185\n00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:28,410\nAll right so, there we go.\n\n186\n00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:30,300\nSo, I just launched my calendar.\n\n187\n00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:33,590\nAnd see how I'm starting\nto get some alerts up here,\n\n188\n00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:35,700\nletting me know that\nI've got a show today.\n\n189\n00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,350\nI've got Mac integration\nbasics starting today.\n\n190\n00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:41,720\nAnd I've got a show starting at 1:30,\nand so on.\n\n191\n00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,950\nSo, it's letting me know that\nthese events are happening.\n\n192\n00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:45,410\nSo, I know it's synchronizing.\n\n193\n00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:48,310\nCuz these events had to\ncome from somewhere, right?\n\n194\n00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:51,350\nAnd if I fire open my calendar and\n\n195\n00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:55,950\ntake a look at it, I can jump in there and\nstart to see here's some events.\n\n196\n00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:58,590\nI've got Mac integration\nbasics going on all week,\n\n197\n00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:02,510\nI've got shows that are going on,\nI've got a party on Friday to get to.\n\n198\n00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:06,570\nSo, I can start to see this information\nall coming from my Exchange server.\n\n199\n00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:11,930\nAnd as we create new events, so\nwhen I go to add a new event here.\n\n200\n00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:17,450\nSo I can say Wednesday at 3 PM,\n\n201\n00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:21,593\nturn in progress report.\n\n202\n00:10:21,593 --> 00:10:24,090\nAll right, so there it goes.\n\n203\n00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:26,400\nIt creates it, it adds that entry.\n\n204\n00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:30,200\nAnd you've got these little boxes where\nyou can choose whether it's going just on\n\n205\n00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,310\nyour Mac or to Exchange.\n\n206\n00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:34,680\nAnd see how mine defaulted to Exchange.\n\n207\n00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:38,780\nIf I had chosen one of these up here\nit would stay just on this machine and\n\n208\n00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:40,830\nnot synchronize up to the server.\n\n209\n00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:44,639\nBut if I choose this option which was\nthe default, it will go up to the server.\n\n210\n00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:47,310\nAll right.\n\n211\n00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:51,930\nSo now, I've got my calendar piece\nconnected up to exchange and\n\n212\n00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:52,680\nworking happy.\n\n213\n00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:56,190\nIf I had chosen Google, then this would\nbe linked up with Google Calendar.\n\n214\n00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:59,160\nAnd I would see my Google Calendar\ninformation in there too.\n\n215\n00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,170\nAnd you can have more than one calendar,\nright?\n\n216\n00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:04,660\nSo on the left side, if I click I\nsee my exchange calendar on my Mac.\n\n217\n00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:07,740\nI could go back to my Internet\naccount options, and add Google.\n\n218\n00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:09,700\nAnd then I could have it\nlike Google calendar also.\n\n219\n00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:13,400\nOr if you're like me, you have seven or\neight Google calendars that are all in\n\n220\n00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,830\nthere for\ntracking what's going on on a given week.\n\n221\n00:11:16,922 --> 00:11:20,430\nAll right, so\nthat's the calendar side of things.\n\n222\n00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:22,450\nContacts, same thing.\n\n223\n00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:25,460\nUnder contacts I didn't have\nanything before, I just had Apple.\n\n224\n00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:28,240\nNow I have Christopher Walken and\nRonnie Wong, right?\n\n225\n00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,540\nThose are my contacts over\non the exchange server.\n\n226\n00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:35,863\nThey've synchronized and\nI can see there's rwong@lab.itpro.tv and\n\n227\n00:11:35,863 --> 00:11:38,030\ncwalken@lab.itpro.tv.\n\n228\n00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,290\nSo I've got those people\ncoming in from my contacts.\n\n229\n00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:45,380\nAnd if we add a new contact,\nwhen we go to add one,\n\n230\n00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:48,770\nbasically we have the new account,\nnew contact that's gonna be created.\n\n231\n00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:51,680\nAnd that'll get synchronized\nup to the server.\n\n232\n00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:57,350\nSo if I create one for,\nhere we'll create one for Bob Dole.\n\n233\n00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:02,388\nAnd he'll be, maybe I just have\na phone number for him, right?\n\n234\n00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:07,346\nSo I can put in 555-1212, all right.\n\n235\n00:12:07,346 --> 00:12:08,680\nWhy is it upset about that number?\n\n236\n00:12:12,305 --> 00:12:14,400\nOh, it wasn't upset about it,\nI just deleted it.\n\n237\n00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,030\nThere we go, all right.\n\n238\n00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:18,010\nSo we're gonna punch that in,\nso now I've got a Bob Dole.\n\n239\n00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:20,970\nAnd that's gonna synchronize up\nto the server to be there and\n\n240\n00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:23,060\nyou know on the left side you\ncan filter these things out.\n\n241\n00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:27,280\nSaying show me my Exchange contacts or\nmy local contacts or whatever.\n\n242\n00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,860\nAnd under Exchange I can\nsee Bob Dole right there.\n\n243\n00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:32,610\nSo that's now been synchronized,\nit's on the server.\n\n244\n00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:33,370\nPretty cut and dry.\n\n245\n00:12:34,682 --> 00:12:38,670\nAll right the last part was email and\nso if I go and fire up my mail client.\n\n246\n00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:42,460\nBefore I didn't see anything,\nnow I'm going to see my Exchange mailbox.\n\n247\n00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:46,750\nSo when it fires up, I'm being impatient.\n\n248\n00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:51,800\nSo ii fires up and then what we'll see\nwhen we get in here is this right here.\n\n249\n00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,800\nSo I see the emails on the left side.\n\n250\n00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:56,860\nAnd if I click on one I can\nread the actual message body.\n\n251\n00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,860\nThere it is, I've got my email.\n\n252\n00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:01,040\nAgain, all connected\nwith the Exchange server.\n\n253\n00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,890\nI didn't have to punch in server names, or\nport numbers, or anything crazy like that.\n\n254\n00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:08,540\nThe built in native support for\nGoogle Apps, iCloud and\n\n255\n00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:12,660\nExchange makes it where I just type\nin an email address and password.\n\n256\n00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:16,420\nAnd everything else synchronizes, set up\ncouldn't be easier for those services.\n\n257\n00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,960\nAll right.\n\n258\n00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:23,980\nBut what if I had a server that was out\nthere that wasn't Microsoft Exchange,\n\n259\n00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:26,000\nor Google Apps, or iCloud, right?\n\n260\n00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,440\nWhat if I just had my own,\nif I was running a Postfix server or\n\n261\n00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,140\nSquirrelMail or something like that.\n\n262\n00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:36,300\nAnd I wanted to be able to connect up and\nwork with that system?\n\n263\n00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:37,340\nWell, that's not in the list.\n\n264\n00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:40,110\nI don't have that as my option\nof servers to connect to, so\n\n265\n00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:43,030\nthat's where we go to the other options.\n\n266\n00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,840\nAll right, let's take a look at that.\n\n267\n00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:48,880\nSo I'm gonna go back into my system\npreferences and Internet Accounts.\n\n268\n00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,761\nAnd I'm gonna take Exchange, and I'm\njust gonna go ahead and remove that one,\n\n269\n00:13:51,761 --> 00:13:52,930\nI'll get that one out of there.\n\n270\n00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,950\nAll right, so now it's gone.\n\n271\n00:13:55,950 --> 00:14:00,210\nAnd when you remove it,\nnotice how my notifications are gone here.\n\n272\n00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:03,720\nIf I go back into my calendar,\nthe calendar entries are gone.\n\n273\n00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:06,404\nSo when you remove that server anything\nthat is synchronized up to it,\n\n274\n00:14:06,404 --> 00:14:08,730\nit gets wiped out you don't\nmaintain a copy of it by default.\n\n275\n00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:12,230\nAll right.\n\n276\n00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:15,060\nSo now what I'm gonna do, because\nI'm gonna do a non standard service.\n\n277\n00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:19,513\nI'll go down here to add other account and\nwhen you add another account.\n\n278\n00:14:19,513 --> 00:14:24,690\nYou get some choices, mail, messages, and\nthen things start to get weird, right.\n\n279\n00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:28,530\nCalDAV, CardDAV, LDAP, OS X.\n\n280\n00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:30,020\nWhat are these things, right?\n\n281\n00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:32,730\nWell, starting at the top,\nadd a mail account.\n\n282\n00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:34,050\nIt's pretty obvious right?\n\n283\n00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:35,330\nWe're adding an email account and\n\n284\n00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:40,490\nit's going to let us pick a POP3 or\nIMAP4 server.\n\n285\n00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:44,820\nPOP3 and IMAP4, those are other\nemail protocols that are out there\n\n286\n00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:48,320\nthat allow us to connect and\ndownload and read emails.\n\n287\n00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,660\nWe can also send emails.\n\n288\n00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:51,790\nSo it's gonna take care\nof getting those set up.\n\n289\n00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:54,730\nNow, we're gonna need to provide it with\nmore information than the other one,\n\n290\n00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:55,610\nthe other wizard.\n\n291\n00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:58,770\nWe can't just do an email address and\na password, that's not gonna be enough.\n\n292\n00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:02,520\nWe're gonna have to provide it server\nnames, and port names, and so on.\n\n293\n00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,190\nSo if I choose to add a mail account and\n\n294\n00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:07,700\nhit create, the next screen is gonna\nask me for that email and password.\n\n295\n00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:10,210\nBecause it's gonna try and\nfigure things out.\n\n296\n00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:14,435\nSo I might come in here and\nsay, yeah I'm student three and\n\n297\n00:15:14,435 --> 00:15:17,638\nthe server is, let's see, WinServer 1.\n\n298\n00:15:20,306 --> 00:15:24,805\nAnd, I'll punch in my password,\nactually here we'll use my account,\n\n299\n00:15:24,805 --> 00:15:26,640\ndpezet, all right.\n\n300\n00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:31,495\nAnd it's telling me the account must be\nmanually configured, and I'll hit next.\n\n301\n00:15:31,495 --> 00:15:35,765\nAnd now it's asking is it IMAP,\nor is it POP, okay?\n\n302\n00:15:35,765 --> 00:15:38,665\nSo I need to tell it right here, and\nit's important that we pick the right one.\n\n303\n00:15:38,665 --> 00:15:40,505\nBecause it doesn't like\nyou to change it later,\n\n304\n00:15:40,505 --> 00:15:43,835\nit's actually easier just to delete\nthe account and re-add it at that point.\n\n305\n00:15:43,835 --> 00:15:46,185\nSo which one is it going to be?\n\n306\n00:15:46,185 --> 00:15:48,255\nThere's pros and cons for each one.\n\n307\n00:15:48,255 --> 00:15:52,345\nPOP, you download the emails and\nyou typically delete them off the server.\n\n308\n00:15:52,345 --> 00:15:55,540\nSo they no longer exist on the server,\nyou might not want that.\n\n309\n00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:58,300\nIMAP by default,\nsynchronizes with the server.\n\n310\n00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:01,420\nSo the emails stay in both places and\nyou just mark them as read.\n\n311\n00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:04,050\nThat's generally the big\ndifference between the two.\n\n312\n00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:08,390\nThere's others, other differences,\nlike IMAP has much better folder support,\n\n313\n00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:10,750\nwhereas POP3 is not\nvery good with folders.\n\n314\n00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:13,330\nBut it does vary based on your server too.\n\n315\n00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:16,930\nSo don't take that as\na always true statement.\n\n316\n00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:18,930\nAll right so\nlet's say I'm going to go, IMAP and\n\n317\n00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:23,855\nI'll say that my server is that\nwinserver1.lab.itpro.tv and\n\n318\n00:16:23,855 --> 00:16:27,130\nI'll punch in my username of dpezet.\n\n319\n00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:28,300\nAnd my password.\n\n320\n00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:32,830\nIt's going to try and connect using IMAP.\n\n321\n00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:36,030\nIt's going to reach out to that server and\nsee if it runs IMAP.\n\n322\n00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:39,510\nIt's going to try IMAP with SSL first,\na secure connection.\n\n323\n00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:43,220\nAnd if that fails then it will drop down\nand use a non-secure version of IMAP.\n\n324\n00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:44,640\nSo be careful with that.\n\n325\n00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:47,600\nSometimes you'll end up with\na non-encrypted connection.\n\n326\n00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,949\nIt all depends on the server.\n\n327\n00:16:50,029 --> 00:16:55,965\nNow IMAP and POP3 are designed to\nreceive email, but when we send email,\n\n328\n00:16:55,965 --> 00:17:01,136\nwe generally send with SMTP,\nSimple Mail Transport Protocol,\n\n329\n00:17:01,136 --> 00:17:05,349\njust for reference,\nPOP is Post Office Protocol and\n\n330\n00:17:05,349 --> 00:17:09,788\nIMAP is the Internet Message and\nsomething protocol.\n\n331\n00:17:09,788 --> 00:17:13,240\n[LAUGH] Now I've forgotten\nwhat IMAP stands for.\n\n332\n00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:16,610\nBut they're just different messaging\nprotocols that are available.\n\n333\n00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:19,330\nI'm going to look it up because it's\ngoing to kill me if I can't remember.\n\n334\n00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:24,506\nInternet Message Access Protocol,\nthere we go, quick google search.\n\n335\n00:17:24,506 --> 00:17:29,548\nSMTP we should specify server,\noften times it's the same exact server,\n\n336\n00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:32,080\nand that's exactly how it is for me.\n\n337\n00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,950\nAnd we'll have to punch in\nthe username and password.\n\n338\n00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:38,450\nNot every SMTP sever requires\na username and password,\n\n339\n00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:40,980\nif you're on the same network\nas that server you might not.\n\n340\n00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:44,330\nBut in my case it will, so\nI will go ahead and put that in there.\n\n341\n00:17:47,489 --> 00:17:51,660\nNow it's going to get it created and\nI got an email client again.\n\n342\n00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:54,400\nThis is now set up to\nuse IMAP with my server.\n\n343\n00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:57,800\nDown here I was saying use with mail?\n\n344\n00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:00,520\nI can also use this for\nnotes if I want to.\n\n345\n00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:03,100\nSo I could check that off\nto synchronize my notes.\n\n346\n00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:05,900\nAnd now the notes are going to\nsynchronize on my iMac server also.\n\n347\n00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,060\nAll right.\n\n348\n00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:10,580\nIf I fire up email, I can see I've already\ngot some emails coming through, right.\n\n349\n00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:12,400\nSo there's those emails from before.\n\n350\n00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:16,260\nAnd if I fire up my notes, well, I don't\nreally have any notes, I don't think.\n\n351\n00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:18,270\nBut I could come through and create one.\n\n352\n00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:19,190\nThis is a new note.\n\n353\n00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:22,590\nThere, all right, so\nnow we've got a new note.\n\n354\n00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:23,229\nVery exciting.\nAnd\n\n355\n00:18:23,229 --> 00:18:26,418\nit's going to synchronize\nthat up with me email server.\n\n356\n00:18:27,917 --> 00:18:33,168\nIf I go on the calendar, still nothing\nthere, and that's because what we just\n\n357\n00:18:33,168 --> 00:18:38,610\ndid was just for email, well email and\nnotes, now that I checked that box.\n\n358\n00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:40,530\nIf I still want contacts, and\n\n359\n00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:44,140\nothers, I've got to go through and\nadd those to my system.\n\n360\n00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:48,010\nSo, that was just one piece,\nthat was just email.\n\n361\n00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:51,470\nIf I go to add other account,\nI'll see the other things that I can do.\n\n362\n00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:54,480\nAdd a Messages Account, we're going\nto talk about in another episode,\n\n363\n00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,200\nthat's Instant Messaging, like Chats.\n\n364\n00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:02,655\nWe've got CalDAV,\nthat's Calendar Distributed Authoring and\n\n365\n00:19:02,655 --> 00:19:07,670\nVersioning ,CalDAV, and\nwhat CalDAV is, is an open standard\n\n366\n00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:13,130\nthat any software vendor can use to allow\nyou to synchronize with their calendars.\n\n367\n00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:16,530\nIf somebody has a third\nparty calendaring system,\n\n368\n00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:18,520\nas long as they're CalDAV compliant or\n\n369\n00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:21,500\ncompatible, then we can connect to\nthem and synchronize our calendar.\n\n370\n00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:26,410\nNow I don't honestly know if Exchange\nis a CalDAV compliant system,\n\n371\n00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:28,800\nit's Exchange that I'm\nconnecting to right now.\n\n372\n00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,560\nSo I can give it a shot.\n\n373\n00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,392\nWe'll see.\n\n374\n00:19:31,704 --> 00:19:36,755\nI'll tell it here that I'm going to try\nand do automatic we'll see if this works.\n\n375\n00:19:36,755 --> 00:19:38,020\n[LAUGH] we'll find out live on the air.\n\n376\n00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:39,250\nThat's the best time to test something.\n\n377\n00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:43,120\nSo I'm going to reach out and\nwe shall see if it's compatible.\n\n378\n00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,271\nI don't think it is.\n\n379\n00:19:46,963 --> 00:19:49,100\nA secure connection it\nmust not be running.\n\n380\n00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:52,640\nYou do need to have some system out\nthere to be CalDAV compliant, and\n\n381\n00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:56,050\nyou can connect to it and\nsynchronize your calendar that way.\n\n382\n00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:59,660\nSame thing goes for the CardDAV.\n\n383\n00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:02,690\nCardDAV, that's for contacts.\n\n384\n00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:04,330\nWhy is it called CardDAV?\n\n385\n00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:06,750\nIt's kind of like a play\non the old Rolodex.\n\n386\n00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:10,900\nIn the Rolodex, you'd have a card for each\ncontact, each person that you'd called.\n\n387\n00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:15,350\nSo they call it CardDAV, that's the open\nstandard for contact synchronization.\n\n388\n00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:18,590\nAdd an LDAP account.\n\n389\n00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:22,160\nLDAP is\nLightweight Directory Access Protocol.\n\n390\n00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:26,380\nA lot of centralized directory\nservices like Open Directory and\n\n391\n00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:31,240\nActive Directory, use LDAP under\nthe hood for all of their accounts.\n\n392\n00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:34,950\nIf you connect to an LDAP server that's\na great place to pull your contacts from.\n\n393\n00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:39,090\nSo you can reach out and\nget your contact list from there.\n\n394\n00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:43,120\nAnd then lastly you've got add an OS X or\nOS 10 server account and\n\n395\n00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:47,400\nthat's where, if we're running our own\nmail server inside of the server app.\n\n396\n00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,204\nSo if I go to my server app over here.\n\n397\n00:20:51,504 --> 00:20:52,980\nAnd let me just get connected to it.\n\n398\n00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:58,370\nInside of the server app, it has its\nown email server and calendaring and\n\n399\n00:20:58,370 --> 00:21:01,760\ncontacts and\nall of that built into the server app.\n\n400\n00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,690\nRight here I've got Calendar,\nContacts, and Mail.\n\n401\n00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:07,520\nAnd I've got those turned on for\nmy system.\n\n402\n00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10,660\nSo any account that I create,\nif I go under users, all these\n\n403\n00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:15,230\nlocal network users, they're all getting\na calendar, they're getting contacts,\n\n404\n00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:20,640\nthey're getting email support, set up for\nthem right here on the server.\n\n405\n00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:24,030\nI could go over here and say,\nadd an OS X account, and\n\n406\n00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:27,860\nhit create, and I could specify the sever,\nand see how it found it for me.\n\n407\n00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:28,689\nIt right there on the network.\n\n408\n00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,830\nAnd now I can start to\npunch in the information.\n\n409\n00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:34,875\nI'm logged in right now as student three.\n\n410\n00:21:37,917 --> 00:21:41,140\nWhich is apparently really hard to type,\nand I'll go ahead hit set up.\n\n411\n00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:42,930\nIt's going to reach out to\nthat server to connect.\n\n412\n00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:45,750\nAnd see I get the whole suite of options,\nMail, Contacts,\n\n413\n00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:48,520\nCalendar, Reminders, the whole shebang.\n\n414\n00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:51,290\nAll right off of that Mac OS server.\n\n415\n00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:52,090\nAll right.\n\n416\n00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:54,620\nNow that it's on there,\nit's going to synchronize real quick.\n\n417\n00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:58,920\nI'm now pulling email from two\ndifferent places, but the rest of this,\n\n418\n00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:02,490\nlike my calendar, and so on,\nis all coming from that server.\n\n419\n00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:05,830\nAnd, if I go back into my\ncalendar now let's see,\n\n420\n00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:09,170\ncan't verify the identity of\nanother untrusted certificate.\n\n421\n00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:12,510\nI'm using self signed certificates here,\nand so they're not trusted.\n\n422\n00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:14,240\nI think, did I not bind this?\n\n423\n00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,420\nI might not have bound it.\n\n424\n00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:20,150\nWhen you bind a client to a server,\nfor that directory service,\n\n425\n00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:24,620\nyou'll automatically trust its certificate\nand I'm guessing that I haven't done that.\n\n426\n00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:30,030\nLet me go into my user accounts and\nsee no, it is bound.\n\n427\n00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:33,330\nI'm not sure why it's not trusting it,\nbut I'll just trust it right here.\n\n428\n00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:34,890\nI'll just say always trust it, and\n\n429\n00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:39,000\nyou can verify right here under the trust\ndrop down box that it's got always trust.\n\n430\n00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,067\nThat should make it happy.\n\n431\n00:22:46,325 --> 00:22:48,050\nThere we go all right.\n\n432\n00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:50,720\nNow I'm in my inbox and\nit's still synchronizing.\n\n433\n00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,210\nBut if I drop this down I can\nsee my separate inboxes and\n\n434\n00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:58,950\nmy OS X server one that ones empty I\ndon't have any email in there yet.\n\n435\n00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:01,920\nIf I go into my Windows one\nI'll see those emails, and\n\n436\n00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:05,130\nif I go in the default inbox,\nit's actually merging the two.\n\n437\n00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:09,710\nSo I'm seeing both my Mac OS server,\nand my Exchange server.\n\n438\n00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:12,310\nAnd the same thing would go for\nCalendar, Contacts,\n\n439\n00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:15,340\nall of the other ones,\nit's merging them together.\n\n440\n00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:17,986\nThat's why you have these\nlittle filters on the sides, so\n\n441\n00:23:17,986 --> 00:23:19,936\nyou can kinda adjust\nwho it is that you see.\n\n442\n00:23:22,631 --> 00:23:27,157\nI don't have a lot that's terribly\nexciting to see in there, but\n\n443\n00:23:27,157 --> 00:23:28,730\nthat is basically it.\n\n444\n00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:32,170\nAll right, what else was there?\n\n445\n00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:32,820\nLet's take a look.\n\n446\n00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:36,350\nLet me go back into my Internet Accounts.\n\n447\n00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:39,950\nAnd, so I've got that OS 10 server set up,\nI've got that Windows server.\n\n448\n00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:41,570\nI can continue to set up more.\n\n449\n00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:44,040\nAs many different system as you have.\n\n450\n00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:47,840\nAdd in Facebook, Flickr,\nwhatever it is that you're gonna be using,\n\n451\n00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:51,040\nget those put in there,\npretty straightforward.\n\n452\n00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:54,680\nOnce they're added in,\nyou just go off and run.\n\n453\n00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:57,550\nYou don't usually have to mess\nwith it again, it just runs.\n\n454\n00:23:57,550 --> 00:24:00,620\nThe mail client is fully integrated\nwith the notification center,\n\n455\n00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:04,300\nwhich is nice regardless of\nwhat server you connect to.\n\n456\n00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:08,650\nAny new emails and other notices will come\nright up here in your notification center.\n\n457\n00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:12,160\nIf it's Microsoft Exchange or iCloud or\nwhatever, it will all show there.\n\n458\n00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:15,470\nIt's nice to have that real\ntight integration with the OS,\n\n459\n00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:17,100\nif you're using this client.\n\n460\n00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:21,130\nIf you're using something like\nMozilla Thunderbird, well you can.\n\n461\n00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:25,070\nThere is a Mac version for it, but\nit doesn't integrate as kindly.\n\n462\n00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:26,970\nI shouldn't say that because I\nhaven't run the newest version so\n\n463\n00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:27,720\nmaybe they've added it.\n\n464\n00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:30,180\nThe last version I ran didn't\nsupport the notification center.\n\n465\n00:24:32,262 --> 00:24:35,540\nAll right that is basically it, let me\njust make sure I haven't missed anything.\n\n466\n00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:38,420\nI think I've covered each\nof the elements there.\n\n467\n00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:42,750\nHopefully you're using a mail system that\nis just supported right there in the basic\n\n468\n00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:46,100\nconfig, so you just pick the system, punch\nyour username and password in and you're\n\n469\n00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:50,710\ndone, but if you've got your own system,\nyour own third party system, you can go\n\n470\n00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:54,610\nthrough and do just a custom install there\nyou specify your servers port numbers,\n\n471\n00:24:54,610 --> 00:24:59,300\nwhatever, and then off you go, so getting\nconnected is pretty easy, and then each\n\n472\n00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:03,220\nuser is users logout and log back on they\ncan configure their own settings so you\n\n473\n00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:08,210\nmay have more than one user profile set\nup, so just takes care of what you need.\n\n474\n00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:11,070\nAnother option,\nif you're using the OS X server, so\n\n475\n00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:16,030\nI did it here manually, another option\nwould be to use the Profile Manager.\n\n476\n00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:19,250\nAnd you can actually use the Profile\nManager to push that configuration\n\n477\n00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:22,730\nout to the clients so\nthey're already set up before they launch.\n\n478\n00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:24,350\nYou can't really do that\nwith the other ones.\n\n479\n00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:26,782\nThat's kind of a nice thing\nabout using the Mac OS server.\n\n480\n00:25:28,082 --> 00:25:29,270\nAll right.\n\n481\n00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:31,980\nWell, I know this is going to be one\nof our shorter episodes here, but\n\n482\n00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:35,090\nthat's really about it for\nadding Internet Accounts.\n\n483\n00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:36,480\nWe didn't talk about Messaging, but\n\n484\n00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,850\nthat's because we have\na dedicated section on that.\n\n485\n00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:42,320\nWe've got to jump into some slightly\nmore complex stuff with messaging.\n\n486\n00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,500\nBut for the most part that's it.\n\n487\n00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:47,860\nNow you got Email, Contacts and Calendar.\n\n488\n00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:53,330\nWell let me just remind you guys if you\nhave any questions on this as always,\n\n489\n00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:55,410\nlive during the show you\ncan go to itpro.tv/live.\n\n490\n00:25:55,410 --> 00:25:58,310\nYou can post your questions right

00:00:39,483\nWelcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:39,483 --> 00:00:40,383\nI'm Don Pezet and\n\n5\n00:00:40,383 --> 00:00:45,110\nI'm gonna be kicking off another episode\nof Apple Certified Associate this morning.\n\n6\n00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:48,430\nI say this morning,\nwho knows what time it is anymore.\n\n7\n00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:52,310\nBut, we're gonna be jumping right back\nin to our Mac integration basics.\n\n8\n00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:56,220\nAnd we've got what's probably one of\nthe more important episodes today.\n\n9\n00:00:56,220 --> 00:01:00,290\nIt's the episode on security and\nMac OS, it has\n\n10\n00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:04,704\na ton of security features built into it\nthat are really cool and really useful.\n\n11\n00:01:05,945 --> 00:01:07,965\nUnfortunately, a lot of\nthem are turned off.\n\n12\n00:01:07,965 --> 00:01:12,455\nAnd, the reason they're turned off\nis not because Mac OS is not secure.\n\n13\n00:01:12,455 --> 00:01:16,335\nIt's because different people\nhave different security needs and\n\n14\n00:01:16,335 --> 00:01:21,140\nsome things are pretty big overkill for\njust a regular home user.\n\n15\n00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:22,960\nBut for a corporate, enterprise,\n\n16\n00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,060\nbusiness user, these are features\nyou're gonna want to use.\n\n17\n00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:29,180\nSo, we need to be familiar with them and\nthat's what we're gonna do here.\n\n18\n00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:33,260\nWe're just gonna run through this laundry\nlist of all the security bells and\n\n19\n00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:38,640\nwhistles that we can enable, get going,\nand get our system running more secure.\n\n20\n00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,020\nAll right,\nnow when we talk about security,\n\n21\n00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:46,180\none of the most visible aspects of\nsecurity is how we log into our system.\n\n22\n00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:50,790\nIf you're a home user and\nyou just have a single Mac laptop, right?\n\n23\n00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:54,830\nSo you got a Macbook and that's it and\nyou're the only one that uses it,\n\n24\n00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:58,430\nyou may have set your system up\nto do automatic logon, right?\n\n25\n00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:01,350\nAutomatic logon is where when you boot\nyour Mac up it doesn't even ask for\n\n26\n00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:05,200\nusername and password, it just goes\nright in and it's pretty easy to setup.\n\n27\n00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,970\nFrom a security stand point that's not\nreally the best thing to do because if you\n\n28\n00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:13,950\nwere to leave your laptop laying on a park\nbench and somebody were to grab it or\n\n29\n00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:17,880\nsomebody breaks in and\nsteals your laptop, they can take it home,\n\n30\n00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:20,660\nturn it on and\nit's gonna automatically login.\n\n31\n00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:24,540\nAnd they'll have access to all of\nthe information that's on your system.\n\n32\n00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:29,474\nSo one of the first steps that we can\ntake in securing our system better Is\n\n33\n00:02:29,474 --> 00:02:32,280\nto disable automatic log on, alright?\n\n34\n00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,670\nNow how do we know if it's turned on?\n\n35\n00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:37,480\nWell it's real easy you turn your\nsystem on, and if it takes you strait\n\n36\n00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:42,250\nto the Mac OS desktop, then there you go,\nyou must have had it turned on.\n\n37\n00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:44,880\nSo we can just turn it off really\nquickly if we don't need it.\n\n38\n00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,480\nSo it's in our system preference,\nso let me go in and do that, so\n\n39\n00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,850\nI'll just go into my system preferences.\n\n40\n00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:54,400\nAnd I'll go down here to users and groups.\n\n41\n00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,150\nInside of users and\n\n42\n00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:59,950\ngroups, you'll see the user accounts and,\nyou've got this log-in options button and\n\n43\n00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:04,190\nthis is the same place we go to, like,\nbind to a directory service or whatever.\n\n44\n00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:07,860\nBut when we're in here, you'll see\nthe automatic log in option right there.\n\n45\n00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:10,780\nNow mine's grayed out because\nI'm not authenticated yet so\n\n46\n00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:13,250\nI'm gonna hit my lock to unlock this.\n\n47\n00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:14,800\nThere we go.\nAnd you'll see where you\n\n48\n00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,070\ncan turn that automatic log on on or off.\n\n49\n00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:20,650\nAnd when you turn it on you basically\npick what user it's gonna log in as.\n\n50\n00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:23,020\nSo we can specify that right here.\n\n51\n00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:26,710\nIf you're worried about security,\nthis is not an option you're going to use.\n\n52\n00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:31,130\nYou're gonna make sure that you choose\noff to ensure that you're secure.\n\n53\n00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,920\nThere are a few other little options\nhere you can do to help with security.\n\n54\n00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,630\nBy default when you turn your Mac\non even if automatic log on is off,\n\n55\n00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:41,030\nwhat do you see?\n\n56\n00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:43,920\nWell, you see a screen that shows\n\n57\n00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,940\nthe user accounts that are on your\nsystem all the local user accounts.\n\n58\n00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:50,550\nSo you'll see a little bubble for\neach of your local users, all right.\n\n59\n00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:55,910\nWell, we may want to harden that a little\nbit more and say when somebody logs in,\n\n60\n00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:59,940\nthere's two pieces of information they\ngive, a user name and a password.\n\n61\n00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:02,380\nWell, when you're displaying\nthose login bubbles,\n\n62\n00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:04,800\nthe user name is already\nright there on the screen.\n\n63\n00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:08,900\nWe can see it, so we've already given\naway one piece of information, and so\n\n64\n00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,450\nnow it's just a password.\n\n65\n00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:13,080\nThe passwords the only thing you\nneed to get in at that point.\n\n66\n00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,690\nSo we might choose to say, you know what,\n\n67\n00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:19,400\ninstead of displaying the login window as\na list of users, maybe we display name and\n\n68\n00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:23,660\npassword, and that way when somebody\nlogs in they have to provide both.\n\n69\n00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:27,160\nIf they stole your laptop they have\nto guess both the username and\n\n70\n00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,510\nthe password, not just the password.\n\n71\n00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:31,710\nNow that's not the greatest\nsecurity in the world but\n\n72\n00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:35,080\nit does build a little bit of\nextra protection for your system.\n\n73\n00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:40,488\nAll right, so those are a couple of\noptions right there with just how we get\n\n74\n00:04:40,488 --> 00:04:42,240\nlogged in to the system.\n\n75\n00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,010\nNow I mentioned there were two pieces to\nit, right, the user name and the password.\n\n76\n00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:49,080\nThe password is the other\npart that's important for us.\n\n77\n00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,950\nYour user account, so if I take, like,\n\n78\n00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:55,680\nmy Help Desk account here, it should have\na password assigned to it, all right.\n\n79\n00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,090\nIf you don't have a password assigned\nto it, then you've got a weak login and\n\n80\n00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:00,510\nso anybody could login.\n\n81\n00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:03,240\nIt might as well automatic\nlog-in at that point, all right.\n\n82\n00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,210\nSo you need to make sure\nthat you have a good and\n\n83\n00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:07,620\nstrong password assigned to your account.\n\n84\n00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,110\nIf I come down here and\ncreate a new account.\n\n85\n00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:13,660\nSo maybe I'll create an account for\nmyself and I'm not gonna do an admin here,\n\n86\n00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:17,070\nI'll just do a standard user and\nsee how I've got the password field here.\n\n87\n00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:20,000\nIf I just hit create user,\nit's gonna warn me that I'm creating\n\n88\n00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,260\na user without a password,\nam i sure that I wanna do that?\n\n89\n00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:26,060\nAnd if I do it, it lets me do it, right.\n\n90\n00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:31,270\nI now have an account with no password and\nif an attacker wants to get into my system\n\n91\n00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:34,130\nthey can just click on this account,\nand they'll get right in, all right.\n\n92\n00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:36,730\nSo we need to make sure\nthat we set passwords,\n\n93\n00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:39,870\non our system and\nnot just set a password, right.\n\n94\n00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:43,180\nSo if I click on this reset password here,\nI can pick a password.\n\n95\n00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:48,440\nWell what if I put the word,\npassword, all lowercase, right?\n\n96\n00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:51,150\nOr something silly like 1234?\n\n97\n00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:52,990\nIt's the same password\nI use on my luggage.\n\n98\n00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:55,200\nSo I'll do one, two, three, four, right.\n\n99\n00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,380\nAnd I'll hit change password.\n\n100\n00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,000\nIt lets me do it.\n\n101\n00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,210\nIt will let you use extremely simple,\n\n102\n00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:06,210\nextremely easy to guess\npasswords if you want.\n\n103\n00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:10,280\nAll right, now if you're using\nan extremely simple password like that,\n\n104\n00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,580\nit kinda defeats the purpose\nof even having a password.\n\n105\n00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,850\nThey're very easy to brute force and\nget in.\n\n106\n00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:19,500\nSo you need to make sure that you use\ngood strong passwords, all right.\n\n107\n00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:23,080\nSo to help with that,\nwe have our password assistant.\n\n108\n00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:26,300\nYou might've noticed when I\nwas on that password screen\n\n109\n00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:30,860\nthis little button here with a key on it,\nall right, that's our Password Assistant.\n\n110\n00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:35,070\nAnd if you hit the Password Assistant,\nit's got several modes that it works\n\n111\n00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:40,250\nthrough to help you evaluate\nthe strength of your password, how good\n\n112\n00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:44,100\nof a password you're picking, or how bad\nof a password you're picking, all right.\n\n113\n00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,640\nNotice that it's got right here this type.\n\n114\n00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:53,140\nThe type has several different modes\nwhere it will suggest passwords to us.\n\n115\n00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:54,570\nLet's start with the manual mode.\n\n116\n00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:58,510\nIn manual mode you type in the password\nthat you want to specify so\n\n117\n00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:01,640\nI did one two three four, okay?\n\n118\n00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:04,290\nNotice this quality rating down here.\n\n119\n00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:06,980\nMy quality rating for\nthat password is pretty poor.\n\n120\n00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:10,130\nI've got a red line,\nit's not a good rating.\n\n121\n00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:13,810\nIf I put the word password, all lowercase.\n\n122\n00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:18,310\nAgain, not a very good rating and it tells\nme that, it says mix upper and lower case,\n\n123\n00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:21,590\npunctuation and\nnumbers to get a better password.\n\n124\n00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:26,740\nThis password is in the dictionary so\nthat's why it got such a low rating, okay.\n\n125\n00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:31,140\nIf I type jumbled letters,\nwell that's not in the dictionary, but\n\n126\n00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:34,080\nit's telling me that I'm not\nmixing upper and lower case.\n\n127\n00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,050\nAnd so again,\nthis is an easy password to guess.\n\n128\n00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:40,610\nIt wants me to pick something better,\nall right.\n\n129\n00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:42,326\nSo it's up to me to do that,\n\n130\n00:07:42,326 --> 00:07:46,678\nto be able to pick a password that is\ngoing to be a little bit stronger.\n\n131\n00:07:46,678 --> 00:07:51,101\nAnd you know, we could do something\nlike Password123, all right.\n\n132\n00:07:51,101 --> 00:07:53,260\nNow notice I got a much better rating.\n\n133\n00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:55,432\nIt's still a crappy password, right.\n\n134\n00:07:55,432 --> 00:07:59,970\nBut it's better because I've got uppercase\nand lowercase, and I've got letters and\n\n135\n00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:00,630\nnumbers.\n\n136\n00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:02,702\nThings are starting to\nget a little bit better.\n\n137\n00:08:02,702 --> 00:08:03,740\nAll right.\n\n138\n00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:08,130\nSo if we come up with a secure password\nthat mixes all these elements together,\n\n139\n00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:09,860\nwe can create something really cool.\n\n140\n00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:12,980\nNow the problem is the more\ncomplex your password gets,\n\n141\n00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:15,270\nthe harder it becomes to remember.\n\n142\n00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:18,800\nSo one of the problems we have is end\nusers just write it on a post-it note and\n\n143\n00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,220\nstick it on their monitor anyway.\n\n144\n00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:22,940\nSo now you've again defeated the purpose.\n\n145\n00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:26,660\nSo what I find is more helpful is\nto use something like a passphrase.\n\n146\n00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:31,020\nInstead of a password, one word, you can\ndo a phrase, like an entire sentence.\n\n147\n00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:33,920\nSentences are awesome because\nthey have spaces in them and\n\n148\n00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:36,210\npunctuation marks as part of the sentence.\n\n149\n00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:37,520\nAnd they have capital letters and\n\n150\n00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:40,670\nlower case letters,\nbecause again, it's a sentence.\n\n151\n00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:48,278\nSo if we were to type in here,\nsomething like My name is Don and I am 37.\n\n152\n00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:48,854\nOkay?\n\n153\n00:08:48,854 --> 00:08:52,871\nThat password right there is long.\n\n154\n00:08:52,871 --> 00:08:53,820\nRight?\n\n155\n00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:55,070\nIt's a long password.\n\n156\n00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:56,670\nThat's a lot of characters.\n\n157\n00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:59,210\nIt's got uppercase and lowercase letters.\n\n158\n00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:00,310\nIt's got spaces.\n\n159\n00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:01,220\nIt's got numbers.\n\n160\n00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:03,790\nIt's got punctuation, so\nit's got special characters.\n\n161\n00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:07,240\nIt's got all the elements of a good,\nstrong password.\n\n162\n00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,680\nAnd you'll see my quality\nis through the roof.\n\n163\n00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,560\nIs that a hard password to remember?\n\n164\n00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,550\nNo.\nIt's pretty easy.\n\n165\n00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:15,240\nI had to remember my name and\nmy age but otherwise right there,\n\n166\n00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:18,390\nI can type it out and there's my password.\n\n167\n00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:19,550\nOr it can be something more generic.\n\n168\n00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:21,020\nRight?\nBecause that might be kind of easy to\n\n169\n00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:22,580\nguess I suppose.\n\n170\n00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:25,420\nI love the number 4.\n\n171\n00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:26,270\nAll right?\n\n172\n00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:27,500\nIt's kind of a nonsensical thing.\n\n173\n00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:32,090\nI don't have any emotional attachment\nto the number four, but as my password,\n\n174\n00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:36,260\nI've got upper and lowercase, special\ncharacters and numbers all mixed together.\n\n175\n00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:37,960\nIt's a good, strong password.\n\n176\n00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,265\nAll right?\n\n177\n00:09:39,265 --> 00:09:41,695\nNow, the problem with\nthe passwords I'm showing you\n\n178\n00:09:41,695 --> 00:09:43,615\nis they're not really random, are they?\n\n179\n00:09:43,615 --> 00:09:47,695\nThere is some logic behind it, and that\nmight lend themselves to being guessed.\n\n180\n00:09:47,695 --> 00:09:53,580\nSo Apple provides another feature to\nhelp us generate truly unique passwords.\n\n181\n00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:55,430\nUnder the type here, I went with manual.\n\n182\n00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:56,790\nRight?\nAnd with manual,\n\n183\n00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:58,550\nall you're really getting\nis the ranking system,\n\n184\n00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:01,340\nyou get a ranking of how\ngood your password is.\n\n185\n00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:05,890\nBut if you drop that down, you'll see\nfive other options that don't just\n\n186\n00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:11,200\nrank a password, but they give you\na suggestion, they suggest the password.\n\n187\n00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,960\nSo like the first one, Memorable.\n\n188\n00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:19,030\nWhat memorable does is it mixes dictionary\nwords with a couple of special characters.\n\n189\n00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:23,820\nSo these are easy to remember, because\nyou can read dictionary words in there.\n\n190\n00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,665\nSo I've got Juno 79/Farrad.\n\n191\n00:10:25,665 --> 00:10:27,205\nAll right.\n\n192\n00:10:27,205 --> 00:10:30,445\nSo, when I look at that,\nI see well, there's some words.\n\n193\n00:10:30,445 --> 00:10:31,445\nJuno and Farrad.\n\n194\n00:10:31,445 --> 00:10:33,075\nI can remember that.\n\n195\n00:10:33,075 --> 00:10:34,005\nAnd 79 slash.\n\n196\n00:10:34,005 --> 00:10:36,545\nThat's not so bad.\n\n197\n00:10:36,545 --> 00:10:40,595\nSo, Juno79/Farrad, with a capital J at the\nbeginning, that's not so bad to remember.\n\n198\n00:10:40,595 --> 00:10:44,785\nThis is a memorable password and\nits quality is pretty decent.\n\n199\n00:10:44,785 --> 00:10:45,345\nRight?\n\n200\n00:10:45,345 --> 00:10:48,680\nIt's not the greatest because\nthe password's not terribly long.\n\n201\n00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:53,470\nIt's also using some dictionary words,\nwhich a dictionary attack could turn up.\n\n202\n00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:56,650\nI could bump up its length\nusing the length slider here.\n\n203\n00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:58,890\nSo maybe I want to go 15 characters.\n\n204\n00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:01,840\nAnd so,\nnow it changed it to grant96/flatley.\n\n205\n00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,470\nAll right.\n\n206\n00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:07,490\nSo again, dictionary words, couple more\ncharacters, and the strength of that\n\n207\n00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:10,309\npassword just went up higher, but\nit's gonna be a little harder to remember.\n\n208\n00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:13,762\nAll right, let me put this back to 12.\n\n209\n00:11:13,762 --> 00:11:16,490\nAll right.\n\n210\n00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:21,140\nAnd Gods532Llama, there we go,\nthere's an interesting one.\n\n211\n00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:23,890\nSo now let me try one of the other\nones like letters and numbers.\n\n212\n00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:27,350\nLetters and numbers is doing exactly\nwhat it says, it's mixing letters and\n\n213\n00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:30,910\nnumbers uppercase letters,\nlowercase letters, and numbers.\n\n214\n00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:34,680\nThese passwords are usually pretty hard to\nremember because there's no logic to them.\n\n215\n00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:40,370\nIt's just kind of a jumbled mess that's in\nthere and so we'll see kind of it listed.\n\n216\n00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:42,870\nYou would pick the the length and\nthe quality is all right.\n\n217\n00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:45,570\nWe also have numbers only.\n\n218\n00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:47,270\nSo now it's just straight up numbers.\n\n219\n00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:49,800\nYou'll get a pretty poor\nrating on just numbers though.\n\n220\n00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,886\nBecause again, it lends itself to\nbrute force attacks pretty easy.\n\n221\n00:11:54,845 --> 00:11:56,510\nThen you've got random.\n\n222\n00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:59,090\nRandom is actually\nthe most secure of them.\n\n223\n00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:03,170\nBecause it mixes letters and\nnumbers, uppercase and lowercase,\n\n224\n00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:06,870\nspecial characters\nwithout dictionary words.\n\n225\n00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:09,450\nSo you'll normally get a higher\nrating here than memorable.\n\n226\n00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:10,780\nAlthough in my case I didn't.\n\n227\n00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:13,360\nI actually got same rating.\n\n228\n00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,740\nNo, it's a little bit better.\n\n229\n00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:17,040\nSo notice memorable,\nI've got my green mark here, and\n\n230\n00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,880\nwhen I switch to random,\nit goes up just a little bit.\n\n231\n00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:27,800\nBut look how hard that would\nbe to remember this password,\n\n232\n00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:32,600\nit's E:/Q*-&U,EG Open square bracket,\nwhatever that thing is.\n\n233\n00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:37,370\nSo that's really, really hard to remember,\nbut it's a truly random and\n\n234\n00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:40,100\nsecure password, so\nit's a good one to use.\n\n235\n00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,900\nIf we bump up its length\na little bit more,\n\n236\n00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:45,220\nyou'll see the quality starts to increase.\n\n237\n00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,260\nAll right.\n\n238\n00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:49,570\nThe very last one is FIPS 181 compliant.\n\n239\n00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:54,310\nHere in the United States we have\na collection of standards that\n\n240\n00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:59,220\nthe US government publishes and FIPS 81,\nor 181 is one of our security standards.\n\n241\n00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:02,180\nSo here it's gonna generate your\npassword that is FIPS 181 compliant.\n\n242\n00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:04,530\nNow while you might say, well, hey,\n\n243\n00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:06,360\nthe US government says\nthat's a good policy to use.\n\n244\n00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,240\nI should use it.\n\n245\n00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:11,680\nThe reality is that standard is pretty\ngarbage and so look at what it did.\n\n246\n00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,480\nIt's random letters.\n\n247\n00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:16,980\nBut they're all lower case,\nno numbers, no special characters.\n\n248\n00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:21,660\nSo just random lower case letters and\nthat results in a pretty poor password.\n\n249\n00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:23,420\nEven with a high length.\n\n250\n00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:23,980\nRight?\n\n251\n00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:27,240\nI'd have to get to 26 characters\nto get a pretty decent one but\n\n252\n00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,550\neven at 15 characters, it's poor.\n\n253\n00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:32,660\nIf I go down to 12 characters or\nsomething that's memorable.\n\n254\n00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:33,230\nRight?\n\n255\n00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:36,110\nThere was this big scientific\nstudy that showed ten digits\n\n256\n00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:37,760\nwas what most people could remember.\n\n257\n00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,970\nAnd at ten digits that's\na pretty bad rating.\n\n258\n00:13:43,511 --> 00:13:44,430\nAll right.\n\n259\n00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:48,810\nSo, we can use this password\nassistant to pick a better password.\n\n260\n00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:49,350\nRight?\n\n261\n00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:50,500\nSo we can pick it.\n\n262\n00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:55,490\nAnd notice how it's typing it in for\nme over here and it only types it in once.\n\n263\n00:13:55,490 --> 00:14:00,330\nIt wants you to type it in the second\ntime to make sure that you can actually\n\n264\n00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:01,438\nremember what it is.\n\n265\n00:14:01,438 --> 00:14:05,710\nSo I'm gonna go in and\ntype in this suggested password.\n\n266\n00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:06,360\nAll right?\n\n267\n00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,810\nAnd we'll go ahead and change it.\n\n268\n00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:09,900\nAnd my passwords don't match.\n\n269\n00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:10,630\nGreat.\n\n270\n00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:13,520\nSo apparently I cannot type\nthe password that they recommended.\n\n271\n00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,261\nWhat did I, oh I did the wrong bracket.\n\n272\n00:14:15,261 --> 00:14:15,803\nI see.\n\n273\n00:14:18,095 --> 00:14:19,230\nThere we go.\n\n274\n00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:21,511\nSo I'll just go in here and type it.\n\n275\n00:14:24,178 --> 00:14:26,303\nAnd there we go.\n\n276\n00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:27,145\nAll right.\n\n277\n00:14:27,145 --> 00:14:29,045\nSo that's the password assistant.\n\n278\n00:14:29,045 --> 00:14:29,885\nPretty useful.\n\n279\n00:14:29,885 --> 00:14:32,175\nFor the exam you would want to be\nfamiliar with those five modes and\n\n280\n00:14:32,175 --> 00:14:33,945\nhow they generate of their passwords.\n\n281\n00:14:33,945 --> 00:14:35,470\nEach one has a different benefit.\n\n282\n00:14:39,178 --> 00:14:41,578\nAll right,\nnow that I'm password protected,\n\n283\n00:14:41,578 --> 00:14:45,868\nif somebody wants to login as me they're\ngoing to have to know my password.\n\n284\n00:14:45,868 --> 00:14:47,900\nSo, I'm gonna go to my\nlogin screen here and\n\n285\n00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:51,800\nI'm gonna flip it to that name and\npassword mode for login.\n\n286\n00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,636\nSo, I just switch that over and\nthen I'm going to logout.\n\n287\n00:14:57,595 --> 00:15:02,428\nNow normally when I log out, [COUGH] I\nwould see bubbles for each of my users.\n\n288\n00:15:02,428 --> 00:15:06,678\nI would see Help Desk and Don Pezet and\neach of the ones that were on this system.\n\n289\n00:15:06,678 --> 00:15:08,436\n[COUGH] Now I don't see any.\n\n290\n00:15:08,436 --> 00:15:09,355\nAll right?\n\n291\n00:15:09,355 --> 00:15:12,575\nAnd so I can come in and I can try and\nlog in as my user account.\n\n292\n00:15:12,575 --> 00:15:16,835\nI have to remember that password,\nwhich I think I remember.\n\n293\n00:15:17,945 --> 00:15:19,137\nOh, shoot I don't remember it.\n\n294\n00:15:19,137 --> 00:15:21,275\nAll right, well,\nlet me log in as help desk instead.\n\n295\n00:15:21,275 --> 00:15:25,305\nSo I can punch in and\nlog in as that account and\n\n296\n00:15:25,305 --> 00:15:27,775\nget into the system and start to work.\n\n297\n00:15:27,775 --> 00:15:30,375\nSo [LAUGH] I've already forgotten\nthat password that I assigned.\n\n298\n00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:33,270\nSo I can go and\nreset that password or whatever.\n\n299\n00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:35,010\nBut even if you have password set,\n\n300\n00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:39,610\nif you've got automatic log on turned on,\nthat is weakening your security.\n\n301\n00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:45,345\nSo like if I were to go in here and\nturn that on, Right?\n\n302\n00:15:45,345 --> 00:15:47,178\nI'll set it to my helpdesk account.\n\n303\n00:15:47,178 --> 00:15:49,105\nAll right.\nSo I've got a password set and\n\n304\n00:15:49,105 --> 00:15:49,942\nthat's great.\n\n305\n00:15:49,942 --> 00:15:50,674\nRight?\n\n306\n00:15:50,674 --> 00:15:52,856\nBut if I were to reboot.\n\n307\n00:15:55,979 --> 00:15:58,719\nWhen I restart I've got a password set,\nbut\n\n308\n00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:03,720\nwhen it boots up it's just gonna\nautomatically log in as Help Desk, right?\n\n309\n00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:07,040\nSo it doesn't matter that I had\na password, I effectively disabled it,\n\n310\n00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,370\nto an extent, right?\n\n311\n00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:11,340\nSomebody will get into the system, but if\nthey try and do any kind of administrative\n\n312\n00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:13,840\nactivity, they're going to\nhave to authenticate then.\n\n313\n00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:16,300\nSo they won't know the password\nto be able to do that.\n\n314\n00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:17,340\nBut, they could try and\n\n315\n00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:20,490\nstage a number of other attacks to\nget into the system at that point.\n\n316\n00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:23,070\nSo, automatic login is\nbest to be disabled.\n\n317\n00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:26,690\nAll right.\n\n318\n00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:28,530\nWell, eventually that'll reboot.\n\n319\n00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:32,820\nI'm using VMWare Fusion and VMWare fusion\nalways seems to have a problem with\n\n320\n00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:36,150\nthe little spinning circle that\nappears right here during boot time.\n\n321\n00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:39,410\nSo it is booting up, I just have to\nbe patient and it'll get in there.\n\n322\n00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:40,190\nThere it is.\n\n323\n00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:40,780\nAll right.\n\n324\n00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:43,650\nAnd see how it didn't ask me for\na user account or anything like that?\n\n325\n00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:45,110\nIt just logged me in.\n\n326\n00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:51,930\nAnd, if I log out and I go to the log-in\nscreen, now I have to provide a password.\n\n327\n00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:53,760\nBut that initial boot-up it didn't and\n\n328\n00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:57,690\nso, if I was an attacker I could take\nthis machine and just reboot it.\n\n329\n00:16:57,690 --> 00:16:59,730\nRight?\nYou know, hold its power button and\n\n330\n00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:03,560\nreboot it that way and then come back\nin and have access to the system.\n\n331\n00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:09,089\nAll right, I'm gonna turn off automatic\nlog on real quick just cuz I don't wanna\n\n332\n00:17:09,089 --> 00:17:09,910\nleave that on.\n\n333\n00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:11,990\nAnd I'll put my other settings\nback to the way they were.\n\n334\n00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:14,300\nSee here, I'm about to perform\nan administrative activity so\n\n335\n00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,650\nI still have to authenticate for that.\n\n336\n00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:18,550\nSo, we do have some protection,\nbut not a ton.\n\n337\n00:17:22,112 --> 00:17:27,090\nAll right, so those are some things\nwith the passwords on our accounts\n\n338\n00:17:27,090 --> 00:17:28,750\nthat we want to make sure we set.\n\n339\n00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:31,600\nThere is another thing; if I\nhave a password on my account,\n\n340\n00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,170\nwhen I log into the computer\nit's going to ask for it right?\n\n341\n00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:36,547\nThat's what logging in is all about.\n\n342\n00:17:36,547 --> 00:17:42,620\nWhat if I walk away from my computer,\nand I just leave myself logged in?\n\n343\n00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:46,420\nWell, anybody could run up, sit down at\nthe computer, and start to use it, right?\n\n344\n00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:51,320\nAnd there was actually a really high\nprofile case about this not too long ago.\n\n345\n00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,340\nThere was a website called Silk Road, and\n\n346\n00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:57,870\nthey were facilitating\nthe sales of illegal drugs and\n\n347\n00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:01,530\nnarcotics, to the tune of millions\nupon millions of dollars, right?\n\n348\n00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:03,570\nI think it was hundreds\nof millions of dollars.\n\n349\n00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:08,560\nAnd the guy who was running the show\nhad a fully encrypted laptop with very\n\n350\n00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:13,670\nstrong passwords and really high security,\ncuz he knew he was doing illegal stuff.\n\n351\n00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:16,070\nWell, when they arrested him,\nthey were tracking him,\n\n352\n00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:17,910\nthey knew that he was\ngoing to this library and\n\n353\n00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:22,420\nhe was using this public network to\nconnect up and then manage the site.\n\n354\n00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:26,520\nAnd so what they did is they put agents in\nthe library, they were stationed in all of\n\n355\n00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:30,170\nthe various book rows and stuff, and\nthey waited for this guy to sit down.\n\n356\n00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:34,800\nHe sat down and he logged into his\ncomputer and as soon as the computer was\n\n357\n00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:37,490\nunlocked, they jumped out and\ngrabbed him and arrested him.\n\n358\n00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:42,150\nAll right, they arrested him after\nhe unlocked his computer all right.\n\n359\n00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:44,830\nBecause now the computer's\nunlocked all that encryption,\n\n360\n00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:47,360\nall that security out the window, right?\n\n361\n00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,400\nThey were able to sit down and have\nfull access to everything on his laptop\n\n362\n00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,370\nbecause they got him at the right time.\n\n363\n00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:56,160\nWell, that's an extreme example there of\nsomebody doing something very illegal.\n\n364\n00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,380\nBut even for\nus just as regular administrators,\n\n365\n00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:02,670\nif you have administrative access to\nyour machine, you can do a lot of stuff.\n\n366\n00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:04,100\nYou have access to a lot of records.\n\n367\n00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:07,100\nAnd if you get up and walk away to run\nto the restroom or get some water or\n\n368\n00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:11,760\nwhatever, someone else could sit down at\nyour machine and now they've got access.\n\n369\n00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,850\nSo we need to prevent that and\nthere's a few different ways to do it, but\n\n370\n00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:19,920\none of the easiest ways is to\nuse a locking screen saver.\n\n371\n00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:23,660\nThat your monitor, if you're walking away,\nyou don't want it to just sit there and\n\n372\n00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:25,170\nstay on while it's idle.\n\n373\n00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:27,530\nYou want it to save power,\nyou know, have it turn off.\n\n374\n00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:31,760\nAnd you can set your system to\nrequire a password when it wakes up.\n\n375\n00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:35,540\nAnd that way if you walk away from your\nmachine and leave yourself logged in,\n\n376\n00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:39,960\nthat idle time will kick in and\nlock your screen, all right.\n\n377\n00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,720\nSo locking the screen is really easy.\n\n378\n00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:44,440\nThe easiest way to do it is\nwith a screen timeout, right?\n\n379\n00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:49,780\nHere are my system preferences, if I go\ninto my energy saver, in energy saver,\n\n380\n00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:52,990\nyou have computer sleep,\nand display sleep.\n\n381\n00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:55,570\nAnd so right here, you can set a value for\nthat display slate.\n\n382\n00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:59,480\nNow on the show I always disable mine,\nthat's why mine are set to never, but\n\n383\n00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:02,936\nwe might want to set this to something\nextremely low like five minutes,\n\n384\n00:20:02,936 --> 00:20:04,601\nall right?\n\n385\n00:20:04,601 --> 00:20:08,780\nIf my computer is sitting idle for\nfive minutes it'll turn the screen off,\n\n386\n00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:09,670\nall right?\n\n387\n00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:12,110\nThat's just energy saving right there,\nthat makes sense.\n\n388\n00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:14,210\nWe want to have that in place, right?\n\n389\n00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:18,250\nAnd in fact, the default I think when you\nbuy a new Mac are ten minutes on this one,\n\n390\n00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,660\nbut it's gonna have this turned on anyway.\n\n391\n00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:23,470\nSo that's gonna make\nour screen go to sleep.\n\n392\n00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:25,330\nWhen the screen goes to sleep,\n\n393\n00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:29,290\nwe can set it to require\na password to wake it back up.\n\n394\n00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:33,080\nSo if I walk away, within five minutes,\nmy computer will automatically\n\n395\n00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:36,430\nput the screen to sleep and if anybody\ntries to come behind me and wake it up,\n\n396\n00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:38,270\nthey're going to have\nto put in a password.\n\n397\n00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:39,040\nSo if they want to get in,\n\n398\n00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:41,860\nthey'll have to do it within five\nminutes of me using the computer last.\n\n399\n00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:45,690\nThat shortens that window of time\nthat they have access to it.\n\n400\n00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:46,320\nAll right.\n\n401\n00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,490\nSo, going in here and setting this\noption that's part of the mix,\n\n402\n00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:51,040\nthere is a little bit more to it.\n\n403\n00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:55,080\nIf I go back to my system preferences,\nyou'll see Security and\n\n404\n00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,860\nPrivacy right here.\n\n405\n00:20:56,860 --> 00:21:01,040\nAnd if we go to Security and\nPrivacy, right here under General,\n\n406\n00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:06,610\nrequire password immediately after\nsleep or screensaver begins.\n\n407\n00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:10,070\nIf the computer goes to sleep,\nor if a screen saver kicks in,\n\n408\n00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:14,660\nwhich includes the screen turning off,\nand you could set a screen saver.\n\n409\n00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:18,000\nIf I go back here in my system\npreferences to desktop and\n\n410\n00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,870\nscreen saver,\nyou can set a screen saver right here, but\n\n411\n00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:23,430\nsee I normally have mine\nset to start after never.\n\n412\n00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:25,310\nI normally turn the screen saver off.\n\n413\n00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:27,760\nBut you might have a screen saver and\nthat's fine.\n\n414\n00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:32,280\nSo if you have that option set,\nthen under Security and Privacy here,\n\n415\n00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:36,190\nif we have require password immediately,\nanytime your screen goes to sleep, or\n\n416\n00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:38,900\nanytime the screen saver kicks on,\n\n417\n00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:41,730\nit's gonna require a password\nto come back in, all right?\n\n418\n00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:43,310\nAnd the default is immediately.\n\n419\n00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:46,300\nNow immediately can be annoying,\nbecause what if you're reading a web page,\n\n420\n00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:50,590\nand it takes you more than five minutes to\nread it, and you don't touch your mouse?\n\n421\n00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:52,420\nWell all of a sudden your\nscreen goes to sleep.\n\n422\n00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:55,230\nAnd, you're going to have to wake\nit back up, and put in a password.\n\n423\n00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:58,832\nSo, what you might want to do is set\na little delay, like five seconds.\n\n424\n00:21:58,832 --> 00:22:00,470\nAll right.\nThis is what I normally do,\n\n425\n00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:01,590\nis five seconds.\n\n426\n00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:03,920\nThat way, if the screen goes to sleep,\nI can just,\n\n427\n00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:07,650\nreal quick, tap the mouse to wake it back\nup, and not have to put my password in.\n\n428\n00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:10,240\nHey, I was using the system,\ndon't lock me out.\n\n429\n00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,000\nBut if the screen goes to sleep and\n\n430\n00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,520\nI take more than five seconds to wake it\nback up then that means I'm not there.\n\n431\n00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:19,670\nAnd if I'm not there, yes,\nI want it to require a password.\n\n432\n00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:20,240\nAll right.\n\n433\n00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:24,010\nSo that can help ensure that\nsomebody doesn't come behind and\n\n434\n00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:26,372\naccess the machine after I've walked away.\n\n435\n00:22:26,372 --> 00:22:27,810\nAll right.\n\n436\n00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:31,020\nThe other cool part is if I go\nback to my screen saver page,\n\n437\n00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:33,250\non the screen saver page.\n\n438\n00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:37,210\nSo I'm going to system preferences,\nand desktop, and screen saver.\n\n439\n00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:38,620\nAnd I'll pick a screen saver,\n\n440\n00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:41,032\nI'll go with these floating\nNational Geographic pictures.\n\n441\n00:22:41,032 --> 00:22:42,460\nAll right.\n\n442\n00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:45,700\nYou can set it to start,\nafter I'll set it to five minutes, and\n\n443\n00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:48,290\nyou can set Hot Corners.\n\n444\n00:22:48,290 --> 00:22:50,970\nHot Corners are cool, because what\nI can do is I can take like my,\n\n445\n00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:56,140\nI'll take my top right corner and\nI'll set that one to start my screensaver.\n\n446\n00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:59,120\nOr if you're not using a screensaver,\nyou can say put display to sleep.\n\n447\n00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,380\nRight, so\nI'll set mine to start screensaver.\n\n448\n00:23:02,947 --> 00:23:04,080\nAll right.\n\n449\n00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:08,370\nAnd what I can do,\nis if I'm gonna walk away from my desk,\n\n450\n00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:12,920\nI can just throw my mouse up into\nthat corner, and what happens?\n\n451\n00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:15,140\nMy screen saver kicks in, right?\n\n452\n00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:17,740\nWhich apparently is just\ngoing to a black screen.\n\n453\n00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:22,990\n[LAUGH] So it makes my screen saver kick\nin, and so now if somebody comes back and\n\n454\n00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:27,000\nthey move the mouse, like I just did,\nthey get the log in screen, right?\n\n455\n00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,440\nAnd they have to provide\na log in to gain access.\n\n456\n00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:35,200\nSo, if I walk away and forget,\nwithin five minutes that will happen.\n\n457\n00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,300\nSo, somebody has a five minute\nattack window to get at my machine.\n\n458\n00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:40,142\nBut, if I walk away and I think about it,\n\n459\n00:23:40,142 --> 00:23:43,249\nI can just throw my mouse right up\nthere in the corner and there we go.\n\n460\n00:23:43,249 --> 00:23:46,936\nNow my screen is locked,\nI moved my mouse within five seconds and\n\n461\n00:23:46,936 --> 00:23:49,065\nit took me right back to the desktop.\n\n462\n00:23:49,065 --> 00:23:49,669\nRight?\n\n463\n00:23:49,669 --> 00:23:53,989\nBut if I move my mouse up there And\nI let it sit for five seconds, so\n\n464\n00:23:53,989 --> 00:23:57,290\nwe'll wait approximately five seconds.\n\n465\n00:23:57,290 --> 00:24:00,820\nAfter that it's going to require the\npassword cause that's what I set, and so\n\n466\n00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:03,030\nI come in here and\nI move my mouse and there we go.\n\n467\n00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:05,790\nNow I've got to provide that password,\nall right?\n\n468\n00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:10,900\nSo that's a quick easy way to make\nit where we can lock our computer so\n\n469\n00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:12,290\nusers don't get access.\n\n470\n00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:17,000\nSo I used hot corners there, there are a\nfew other ways that we can go about it.\n\n471\n00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,360\nFor example, we could turn on fast user\nswitching, I've already got it turned on.\n\n472\n00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,950\nSee how it shows my name up here?\n\n473\n00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:26,430\nHelp desk, all right,\nthat's who I'm logged in as.\n\n474\n00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:32,130\nWell if you click that name, see how\nyou've got this Login window option?\n\n475\n00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:35,690\nYou can choose Login window, and\nit'll take you right back here.\n\n476\n00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:36,300\nAll right.\n\n477\n00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:37,930\nAnd it shows that I'm still logged in.\n\n478\n00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:39,060\nSee that orange check mark?\n\n479\n00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:43,950\nThat lets me know I'm still logged in, but\nnow, I can walk away from this computer\n\n480\n00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:47,230\nand if I come back, I've got to log in,\nbut if somebody else comes,\n\n481\n00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:51,807\nthey'll have to try and log in too, and\nso they can click that account and login.\n\n482\n00:24:51,807 --> 00:24:54,705\nAll right, now just because you are going\nout to the logout window that doesn't mean\n\n483\n00:24:54,705 --> 00:24:55,635\nyou lose your data, right.\n\n484\n00:24:55,635 --> 00:25:00,765\nSo, if I were to fire up something like,\nokay, let me fire up text edit,\n\n485\n00:25:02,405 --> 00:25:06,499\nand I'm going to type a message in\nhere like, this is a test message.\n\n486\n00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:08,410\nAll right.\n\n487\n00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:11,910\nAnd, I'm not going to save this and I'm\njust going to go up to my Apple menu and\n\n488\n00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:13,200\nchoose to log out.\n\n489\n00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:13,780\nAll right?\n\n490\n00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:16,470\nWhen I log out it says,\n\"are you sure you want to log out?\" and\n\n491\n00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:18,950\nI've got the option to relaunch programs.\n\n492\n00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:22,610\nWhen I log out,\nit's actually logging me out and\n\n493\n00:25:22,610 --> 00:25:25,884\nclosing the programs that I was running,\nall right?\n\n494\n00:25:25,884 --> 00:25:29,930\nAnd I don't have an orange check mark here\nbecause all the stuff that I was running\n\n495\n00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:31,350\nis now closed.\n\n496\n00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:34,779\nAnd when I come back in as Help desk,\nand I log back in,\n\n497\n00:25:34,779 --> 00:25:37,540\nI told it to reopen\nthe programs that I had.\n\n498\n00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:40,180\nSo it'll reopen what I had left, but\n\n499\n00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:44,050\nthis was actually closed\nwhile I was logged out.\n\n500\n00:25:44,050 --> 00:25:46,220\nSo if this was a program that\nwas supposed to be running and\n\n501\n00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:49,920\ndoing something, backing up files or\nwhatever, that didn't happen.\n\n502\n00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:50,550\nRight?\n\n503\n00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:52,570\nVersus, when it use fast user switching,\n\n504\n00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:57,010\nif I return to the login window,\nmy programs are still running.\n\n505\n00:25:57,010 --> 00:25:58,490\nThey're still running in the background,\nso\n\n506\n00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:00,370\nif they were doing something\nlike backing up my computer or\n\n507\n00:26:00,370 --> 00:26:02,540\nwhatever, they're still doing that.\n\n508\n00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:05,450\nThat's the advantage of using this screen\nis you can keep your programs running.\n\n509\n00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:09,360\nAnd I can punch in my password and\nget logged back in.\n\n510\n00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:12,960\nAnd see how this was instantly here.\n\n511\n00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:15,410\nA moment ago when I logged\nin it had to relaunch.\n\n512\n00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:19,480\nThe text utility and text that it\npreserves even your unsaved documents.\n\n513\n00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:22,480\nNot every program does that,\nbut it had a relaunch before.\n\n514\n00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,090\nThis time it didn't because\nit was already there.\n\n515\n00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:29,620\nAll right.\nNow, I have fast user switching turned on.\n\n516\n00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:30,490\nYou may not.\n\n517\n00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:31,020\nOkay.\n\n518\n00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:34,670\nIf you don't see your username, so\nlike, if I go to my actual desktop.\n\n519\n00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:38,980\nSo here's my actual laptop I don't\nhave fast user switching on because\n\n520\n00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:40,700\nI'm the only one that uses it,\nnobody else does,\n\n521\n00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:43,080\nso what do I need fast user switching for?\n\n522\n00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:47,060\nSo if you're not using fast user switching\nyou can turn it on pretty easily.\n\n523\n00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:51,148\nIf you go up to your system preferences,\nand\n\n524\n00:26:51,148 --> 00:26:57,238\nyou go to your users and groups,\nand you go to your Logon Options.\n\n525\n00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:03,820\nAnd I'll just unlock here, all right?\n\n526\n00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:07,530\nSee this show fast user\nswitching menu as option?\n\n527\n00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:08,920\nI've got to set the full name right now.\n\n528\n00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:12,620\nIf I turn that off, do you see how my\nname just disappeared from up there.\n\n529\n00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:16,890\nIf I turn it on, now I've got my name,\nand I can do the fast user switching.\n\n530\n00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:20,050\nAnd you can tell it to say full name or\naccount name if you want.\n\n531\n00:27:20,050 --> 00:27:23,840\nAnd so you'll see account name in\nthe menu, not in the drop down.\n\n532\n00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:28,470\nOr you could have it show the icon,\nso now you get the person's icon and\n\n533\n00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:31,430\nyou can pull it that way if you don't want\nto eat up too much screen real estate.\n\n534\n00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:33,440\nSo you can choose how you want to go.\n\n535\n00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:33,950\nAll right.\n\n536\n00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:35,140\nSo pretty easy option to turn on.\n\n537\n00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:37,000\nAll right.\n\n538\n00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,950\nBut what if you're like me and\nyou don't want to use fast user switching?\n\n539\n00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:42,810\nI don't want to use fast\nuser switching on my laptop\n\n540\n00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:46,690\nbecause I'm the only person who uses it\nand you can see I've got a ton of junk up\n\n541\n00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:49,900\nhere already with all these different\nprograms running in the background and\n\n542\n00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:53,990\nso I don't want add my full name up there,\neven my icon, for that matter.\n\n543\n00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:55,180\nIt's just too much stuff.\n\n544\n00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:58,000\nSo, what option do I have there?\n\n545\n00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,390\nWell, there is a third option.\n\n546\n00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:02,230\nIt probably won't show up on the exam,\nbut it's the option that I use.\n\n547\n00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:05,780\nYou might notice on my screen I've\ngot this little lock up here.\n\n548\n00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:08,620\nAnd if I drop that down I\nhave the lock screen option.\n\n549\n00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:10,850\nThat's actually part of\nthe key chain service,\n\n550\n00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:13,510\nthe key chain service that\nremembers your passwords.\n\n551\n00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:16,380\nAnd that key chain service can put that\nlock up there to give you a way to\n\n552\n00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:19,710\nmanually lock your screen if you're\ngoing to be walking away from it.\n\n553\n00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:21,270\nIt's an option that I like to turn on.\n\n554\n00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:23,400\nI have it on my home computer,\nI have it on my laptop,\n\n555\n00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,330\nit's something that I\nusually turn on on machines.\n\n556\n00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:31,250\nIf you want to go that route, you can\njust, I usually use spotlight here to\n\n557\n00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:35,691\nsearch for Key chain and\nI'll pull up my Key chain access utility.\n\n558\n00:28:35,691 --> 00:28:40,225\nIf you want to browse to it, it's on\nyour hard drive under applications and\n\n559\n00:28:40,225 --> 00:28:42,255\nthen utilities,\nyou'll find the Key chain access.\n\n560\n00:28:42,255 --> 00:28:46,755\nAnd when you go into your Key chain\naccess, it's in the settings of\n\n561\n00:28:46,755 --> 00:28:50,537\nKey chain access that you can tell\nthat you want to turn that on.\n\n562\n00:28:50,537 --> 00:28:55,027\nSo, if I go up here to Key chain Access\nand Preferences, in the Preferences,\n\n563\n00:28:55,027 --> 00:28:58,697\nI've got Show key chain\nstatus in menu bar and\n\n564\n00:28:58,697 --> 00:29:01,137\nthat's what adds that\nlittle lock up there.\n\n565\n00:29:01,137 --> 00:29:02,997\nAnd you've got that lock screen option.\n\n566\n00:29:02,997 --> 00:29:05,397\nIt also shows whether your\nkey chain is unlocked, so\n\n567\n00:29:05,397 --> 00:29:08,460\nwhether you've authenticated that\nability to use your passwords, so\n\n568\n00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:11,210\nyou can choose the lock pick key\nchain instead of your screen.\n\n569\n00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:12,940\nSo it gives you a little bit of control.\n\n570\n00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:16,010\nI personally like that, so\nI keep that option there.\n\n571\n00:29:16,010 --> 00:29:19,840\nAnd that gives you the ability\nto quickly lock your screen.\n\n572\n00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:25,630\nNow locking the screen, which worked\nreally well for me right there.\n\n573\n00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:27,200\nWhat is going on?\n\n574\n00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:27,830\nOh, shoot.\n\n575\n00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:33,520\nI'm using Air Display to replicate my\nscreen so that you guys can see it.\n\n576\n00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:36,100\nAnd you can't lock your screen\nwhile you're on Air Display,\n\n577\n00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:37,870\nso it's angry about that.\n\n578\n00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:38,980\nYeah, so it's not going to let me do it.\n\n579\n00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:40,320\nShoot.\n\n580\n00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,400\nWell, anyhow, what I would\nnormally do is lock the screen.\n\n581\n00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,930\nNow, locking your screen is different\n\n582\n00:29:44,930 --> 00:29:48,080\nthan returning to the fast\nuser switching screen.\n\n583\n00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:51,760\nOn the fast user switching screen,\nwe go back to this Login window.\n\n584\n00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,410\nOther people could log in.\n\n585\n00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:56,880\nI can log in as me and\nhelp desk would still be logged in.\n\n586\n00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,110\nNow, more than one person\nwould be logged in.\n\n587\n00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:03,780\nBut when we lock our screen,\nonly we can unlock it.\n\n588\n00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:07,350\nSo another user wouldn't be able to log\nin unless they were an administrator.\n\n589\n00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:10,870\nSo it makes it where we've really\nlocked it down to just us and\n\n590\n00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:13,580\nthat's what I do because I'm\nthe only one who uses my laptop.\n\n591\n00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:14,720\nNobody else does.\n\n592\n00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:18,950\nSo if I'm going to walk away from my\nlaptop, I just jump right up here and\n\n593\n00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:23,390\nI lock my screen, that's typically what I\ndo, the same thing as if you use the hot\n\n594\n00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:27,220\ncorners for doing a screen saver lockout\nor whatever, you could go that route too.\n\n595\n00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:31,290\nI generally don't do the hot\ncorners cause I constantly\n\n596\n00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:34,140\naccidentally move my mouse up in there and\nforget about it and\n\n597\n00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:39,480\nso that's why I don't use it,\nI like this option, all right.\n\n598\n00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:44,080\nSo those were a few different ways that\nwe can lock our screen to ensure that\n\n599\n00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:46,860\npeople can't come behind us and\nstart to user our machine, right?\n\n600\n00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:51,510\nSo to kind of summarize things I've\ntalked about so far, use a password.\n\n601\n00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:53,640\nUse a strong password.\n\n602\n00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:57,360\nAnd then make sure your screen locks one\nway or another when you walk away from it.\n\n603\n00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:00,470\nEither via screen saver,\na screen timeout, or\n\n604\n00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:03,860\nby you manually locking it through\nsome kind of a short cut, right?\n\n605\n00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:05,930\nUse one of those options\nto secure your system.\n\n606\n00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:10,000\nAll right.\nWell I've got a lot more security features\n\n607\n00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,760\nto talk about in this show.\n\n608\n00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,660\nBut I've run out of time\non the first segment.\n\n609\n00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:15,270\nSo let's stop here and take a break.\n\n610\n00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:17,860\nWhen we get back, we're going to look at\nsome of the other security features that\n\n611\n00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:20,840\nare available inside of our Macs that we\njust need to turn on to take advantage of.\n\n612\n00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:22,360\nSo stay tuned.\n\n613\n00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:23,655\nWe'll be back after this.\n\n614\n00:31:23,655 --> 00:31:27,351\n[SOUND] All right,\n\n615\n00:31:27,351 --> 00:31:32,776\nwelcome back everybody.\n\n616\n00:31:32,776 --> 00:31:36,778\nSo in the last segment, I was talking\nabout passwords, and how if you get up and\n\n617\n00:31:36,778 --> 00:31:40,905\nyou walk away from your computer, somebody\nelse could jump right in behind you,\n\n618\n00:31:40,905 --> 00:31:45,110\nhop into your chair, and start to use your\ncomputer because you left it logged in.\n\n619\n00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:47,996\nSo we talked about ways that\nwe can lock the screen and\n\n620\n00:31:47,996 --> 00:31:49,708\nprevent that from happening.\n\n621\n00:31:49,708 --> 00:31:53,748\nBut, if it's a determined attacker,\nthere's something else they can do.\n\n622\n00:31:53,748 --> 00:31:55,960\nYou've walked away from your computer.\n\n623\n00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:58,200\nMaybe you shut your\ncomputer completely down,\n\n624\n00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,852\nmaybe that screen's locked or whatever.\n\n625\n00:31:59,852 --> 00:32:02,510\nSo, that they can't get\ninto the system that way.\n\n626\n00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:05,900\nBut, what they can do is they\ncan turn your computer off.\n\n627\n00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:09,840\nAnd then, they can,\nwell I guess they have two options, right?\n\n628\n00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:14,159\nOn a Mac, when you boot your Mac, If you\nhold the letter t down on the keyboard,\n\n629\n00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:17,709\nyou boot in to what's called target mode,\nt is for target mode.\n\n630\n00:32:17,709 --> 00:32:23,350\nAnd, when you're in target mode, your\nlaptop becomes an external hard drive.\n\n631\n00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:27,561\nYou can take a Thunderbolt or FireWire\ncable and plug your laptop into another\n\n632\n00:32:27,561 --> 00:32:31,016\ncomputer, and it can just access\nit like a regular hard drive.\n\n633\n00:32:31,016 --> 00:32:36,252\nAnd, that means the attacker could take\nyour laptop, could boot it in target mode,\n\n634\n00:32:36,252 --> 00:32:40,920\nattach it to another computer, and\naccess your files without logging in.\n\n635\n00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:46,690\nNow, if you've disabled that functionality\n,or maybe you don't have those ports,\n\n636\n00:32:46,690 --> 00:32:49,650\nthen what they could also do is they\ncan crack open your computer and\n\n637\n00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:51,290\njust rip the hard drive out.\n\n638\n00:32:51,290 --> 00:32:55,640\nTake that hard drive out and add it as\na second hard drive to another computer.\n\n639\n00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:58,790\nAnd, when they do that, they're\nbooting off their own hard drive, and\n\n640\n00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:03,210\nthey see your hard drive as a second\ndrive which they can then browse to\n\n641\n00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:04,545\nand get at your data.\n\n642\n00:33:04,545 --> 00:33:06,535\nEven if you're password protected,\n\n643\n00:33:06,535 --> 00:33:11,435\nthe passwords really only apply when\nyou boot up off of your hard drive.\n\n644\n00:33:11,435 --> 00:33:13,505\nIf you boot up off of\nsomebody else's hard drive,\n\n645\n00:33:13,505 --> 00:33:17,215\nyour passwords don't apply anymore,\nand now they can access your data.\n\n646\n00:33:17,215 --> 00:33:19,325\nSo, that's a problem.\n\n647\n00:33:19,325 --> 00:33:21,085\nThose attacks that I just described,\n\n648\n00:33:21,085 --> 00:33:25,690\nevery one of them requires\nphysical access to your machine.\n\n649\n00:33:25,690 --> 00:33:27,800\nThey've got to physically\nget ahold of your device.\n\n650\n00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:31,910\nSo, the easiest way to prevent\nthis is good physical security.\n\n651\n00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:35,880\nIf it's a desktop computer,\nlock your office at the end of the day.\n\n652\n00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:39,520\nWhen you have a laptop, make sure you\nstick it in a drawer and lock the drawer.\n\n653\n00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:42,820\nBut, if you're taking your\nlaptop to a hotel room, or\n\n654\n00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:46,370\nsomething like that, you may not have\nthe facilities to lock things down.\n\n655\n00:33:46,370 --> 00:33:49,190\nSo, how do we protect our\ndata in that scenario?\n\n656\n00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:54,530\nWell, all Macs have support\nfrom what's called FileVault.\n\n657\n00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:58,765\nFileVault is disc encryption\nsoftware that's a part of Mac OS.\n\n658\n00:33:58,765 --> 00:34:02,435\nIt is very similar to other products\nthat are out there like TrueCrypt and\n\n659\n00:34:02,435 --> 00:34:06,805\nBitLocker, those types of solutions,\nwhere what it does\n\n660\n00:34:06,805 --> 00:34:10,615\nis it takes your hard drive and all\nthe data that's on it, and encrypts it.\n\n661\n00:34:11,765 --> 00:34:15,960\nWhen you boot up the machine, you log in,\nand it's decrypting that data for\n\n662\n00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:16,550\nyou to use it.\n\n663\n00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:17,830\nSo, you don't even notice it's happening.\n\n664\n00:34:17,830 --> 00:34:20,780\nIt's all just in the background,\nkind of invisible to you.\n\n665\n00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:25,070\nBut, if an attacker were to boot\nyour system into target mode,\n\n666\n00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:28,850\nor rip your hard drive out, and add it\nas a second hard drive to their system,\n\n667\n00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:32,610\nall they're going to see\nis a fully encrypted drive.\n\n668\n00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:35,480\nThey won't be able to see any\nof the data that's inside of it.\n\n669\n00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:39,280\nSo, it's a very secure way to prevent\nthose attackers from being able to get at\n\n670\n00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:42,980\nyour data when you're not able to\nphysically secure the machine.\n\n671\n00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:46,160\nAny machine you've deployed in\nan environment that you don't control,\n\n672\n00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:50,580\nso like public areas, libraries, places\nlike that, you should use FileVault.\n\n673\n00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:54,400\nAny time you've got laptops,\nmobile devices that are very easy to lose,\n\n674\n00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:57,050\nthat are easy to steal,\nyou should use FileVault.\n\n675\n00:34:58,310 --> 00:35:02,840\nOn most systems when you enable FileVault,\nthere's not a great performance hit.\n\n676\n00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:05,920\nThere's a very small performance hit,\nand on your newer ones,\n\n677\n00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:08,400\nlike on my MacBook Pro,\nit's not even noticeable.\n\n678\n00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,200\nIf you have SSD,\n\n679\n00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:13,900\nif you have solid state digital storage on\nyour system, you won't notice it at all.\n\n680\n00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:18,190\nEven on regular SATA, the traditional\nspinning disk, it's a very,\n\n681\n00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:20,540\nvery small performance hit\nwhen you run FileVault.\n\n682\n00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:22,780\nSo, there's not really\nany reason not to run it.\n\n683\n00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:26,430\nYou should go ahead and turn it on if you\nare at risk of having your machine stolen.\n\n684\n00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:30,990\nIt is the ultimate protection\nthat can't be bypassed.\n\n685\n00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:35,430\nYou can't bypass it like you can a user\nname and password in some scenarios.\n\n686\n00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:40,010\nThe only option an attacker has if they\nsteal your FileVault encrypted drive\n\n687\n00:35:40,010 --> 00:35:41,030\nis to format the drive.\n\n688\n00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:45,910\nThey can format it, just repartition it,\nand then reinstall Mac OS on top of it.\n\n689\n00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:50,330\nSo, now they're able to use your machine,\nbut they didn't get any of your data.\n\n690\n00:35:50,330 --> 00:35:51,600\nThat's what FileVault does.\n\n691\n00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,920\nFileVault protects your data.\n\n692\n00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,450\nIt doesn't protect the machine, itself.\n\n693\n00:35:54,450 --> 00:35:56,040\nThey already stole it, right?\n\n694\n00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:58,630\nBut, it does protect your data.\n\n695\n00:35:58,630 --> 00:36:02,460\nSo, if you're working in a medical\nenvironment, a financial environment, if\n\n696\n00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:06,980\nyou're handling sensitive records on your\nsystem, FileVault should be a requirement.\n\n697\n00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:09,330\nYou shouldn't even bat an eye,\nyou should run it.\n\n698\n00:36:09,330 --> 00:36:13,370\nBut, even in a personal level, like for\nme, my laptop, I use FileVault,\n\n699\n00:36:13,370 --> 00:36:18,550\nand that's because I know that I log into\nmy email, I log into my company resources.\n\n700\n00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:20,490\nIf somebody were to steal my laptop,\n\n701\n00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:22,390\nI don't want them being\nable to get at that stuff.\n\n702\n00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:25,630\nSo, I need to make sure that\nmy system is protected too.\n\n703\n00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:27,880\nSo, FileVault is a great alternative.\n\n704\n00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:30,420\nIt's super easy to get it configured, and\n\n705\n00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:33,737\nI want to walk you through that process,\nso let's take this workstation here.\n\n706\n00:36:33,737 --> 00:36:36,430\nSo, here's a workstation,\nand how do I even know?\n\n707\n00:36:36,430 --> 00:36:39,050\nI might already have FileVault turned on.\n\n708\n00:36:39,050 --> 00:36:43,790\nWell, we need to go into our\nSystem Preferences, and just double check.\n\n709\n00:36:43,790 --> 00:36:46,350\nInside of System Preferences\nif we go to Security and\n\n710\n00:36:46,350 --> 00:36:49,805\nPrivacy, you'll see a tab up top for\nFileVault.\n\n711\n00:36:49,805 --> 00:36:51,260\nWe've already looked at the general tab.\n\n712\n00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:52,990\nNow, we are going to FileVault.\n\n713\n00:36:52,990 --> 00:36:57,570\nAnd, looking at FileVault,\nI can see that FileVault is turned off for\n\n714\n00:36:57,570 --> 00:36:59,562\nthe disk Macintosh HD.\n\n715\n00:36:59,562 --> 00:37:02,300\nAll right, so\nit is not turn on for my system.\n\n716\n00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:03,640\nAnd, I can turn it on if I want.\n\n717\n00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:05,670\nNow, it is great out here,\ncuz I am not unlocked, so\n\n718\n00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:07,840\nlet me just unlock really quick.\n\n719\n00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:08,810\nThere we go.\n\n720\n00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:10,110\nAnd now, I can turn it on.\n\n721\n00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:10,640\nAll right?\n\n722\n00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:13,450\nSo, it's pretty easy\nto get this turned on.\n\n723\n00:37:13,450 --> 00:37:14,300\nThere's only one button.\n\n724\n00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:17,730\nSo, we'll just hit that Turn on FileVault.\n\n725\n00:37:17,730 --> 00:37:22,433\nNow, by default,\nwhen a system running FileVault turns on,\n\n726\n00:37:22,433 --> 00:37:27,880\nit boots up, you see the Apple logo,\nand then you get a log-on screen.\n\n727\n00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:31,780\nAnd, the log-in screen is where you'll\nprovide a username and password.\n\n728\n00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:33,990\nAnd that username and\npassword, in their keychain,\n\n729\n00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:38,700\nthey'll have the encryption key that lets\nthem decrypt the hard drive to access it.\n\n730\n00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:42,880\nSo, by default, you are enabled.\n\n731\n00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:45,200\nYou are able to unlock that.\n\n732\n00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:48,600\nBut, if you share your laptop with other\npeople, you share your desktop with other\n\n733\n00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:51,630\npeople, then they may have\nlocal accounts here also.\n\n734\n00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:54,200\nAnd, with those local accounts,\n\n735\n00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:59,120\nyou need to pick who's allowed\nto boot this computer up.\n\n736\n00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:02,020\nOnce the computer is booted up,\nyou can use fast user switching and\n\n737\n00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:03,150\nswitch to anybody.\n\n738\n00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:06,270\nBut, just to boot it up,\njust to get into the OS,\n\n739\n00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:10,960\nit has to be a user who has the decryption\nkey to access that hard drive.\n\n740\n00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,600\nAnd, by default, that's just gonna be you.\n\n741\n00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:16,710\nI'm logged in as Help Desk, so\nit's just me that will have that access.\n\n742\n00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:19,620\nBut, I have a Don Pizet account,\nit's not enabled,.\n\n743\n00:38:20,730 --> 00:38:22,760\nThat means that that account is real.\n\n744\n00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:25,430\nIf the system is already booted up,\nI can use fast user switching and\n\n745\n00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:27,090\njump over to that other user.\n\n746\n00:38:27,090 --> 00:38:29,260\nBut, if the system is just booting up,\n\n747\n00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:32,750\nthen this account will not\nbe able to start the system.\n\n748\n00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:35,450\nI'll have to use this Help Desk account.\n\n749\n00:38:35,450 --> 00:38:38,290\nNow, in another caveat here,\nlook at these users.\n\n750\n00:38:38,290 --> 00:38:40,990\nThese are just local users.\n\n751\n00:38:40,990 --> 00:38:45,010\nAt this point, when the system is booting\nup, and getting to this log on screen,\n\n752\n00:38:45,010 --> 00:38:47,830\nit hasn't really initialized\nall the networking systems yet.\n\n753\n00:38:47,830 --> 00:38:51,960\nAnd so, it can't reach out to a directory\nserver, like an active directory server or\n\n754\n00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,960\na open directory server.\n\n755\n00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:55,150\nSo, it's not going to connect to this.\n\n756\n00:38:55,150 --> 00:38:56,810\nI think I am bound to a server, aren't I?\n\n757\n00:38:56,810 --> 00:38:58,720\nLet me go double check that.\n\n758\n00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:01,720\nSo, if I go in here and look,\nno I'm not bound to a server.\n\n759\n00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:04,625\nBut, even if I were bound, I'm not\ngoing to see those network accounts,\n\n760\n00:39:04,625 --> 00:39:06,140\ncuz they're not there yet.\n\n761\n00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:09,715\nSo, we need to have a local account\nthat's able to decrypt the system.\n\n762\n00:39:09,715 --> 00:39:14,620\nAnd, while I'm in here,\nlet me do a couple of things here.\n\n763\n00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:18,060\nI'm gonna reset my password,\nbecause I don't remember what it was\n\n764\n00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:20,730\nfrom the other module, so\nlet me just change that.\n\n765\n00:39:20,730 --> 00:39:22,470\nThere we go, all right.\n\n766\n00:39:22,470 --> 00:39:25,446\nSo, I'll go ahead and\nadd maybe a third account here, so\n\n767\n00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:26,936\nI'll do a John Doe account.\n\n768\n00:39:30,071 --> 00:39:31,760\nAnd, this will just be a standard user.\n\n769\n00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:35,380\nYou don't have to be an administrator\nto unlock the system.\n\n770\n00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:37,110\nYou just have to be enabled, right?\n\n771\n00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:38,700\nYou have to have that decryption key.\n\n772\n00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:43,402\nSo, even a standard user can have\nthe decryption key, if we want them to.\n\n773\n00:39:43,402 --> 00:39:46,072\nSo, I'm going to go back in\nmy security and preferences,\n\n774\n00:39:46,072 --> 00:39:48,859\nI'm going to turn on FileVault And\nthere's my three users.\n\n775\n00:39:48,859 --> 00:39:52,090\nAnd I'm gonna enable my Don Pezet account.\n\n776\n00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:54,680\nNow when I enable the account,\nlook what it's asking.\n\n777\n00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:57,550\nIt says entering this account password\n\n778\n00:39:57,550 --> 00:40:00,460\nallows this user to decrypt\nall files on the startup disk.\n\n779\n00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:03,710\nSo I need to provide that\nperson's password, all right.\n\n780\n00:40:03,710 --> 00:40:06,840\nIf I don't know it,\nI'm gonna have to get them to come and\n\n781\n00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:10,050\npunch in their password or I'm gonna have\nto reset it to something I do know so\n\n782\n00:40:10,050 --> 00:40:11,980\nthat I can complete the wizard, right.\n\n783\n00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:13,550\nI just enabled that one.\n\n784\n00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:18,650\nSo now help desk can log in and unlock\nthe system, Don Pizet can log in and\n\n785\n00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:23,420\nunlock the system but John Doe cannot,\nthey're not in that list.\n\n786\n00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:25,340\nAnd we'll see that when we\ntest it here in a few minutes.\n\n787\n00:40:26,990 --> 00:40:28,840\nAll right, I'm gonna go ahead and\nhit Continue.\n\n788\n00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:33,300\nAnd now is something really important.\n\n789\n00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:37,950\nAll right, what happens if, maybe I just\nenable one user, I just enable Don Pezet,\n\n790\n00:40:37,950 --> 00:40:40,260\nand then I forget my password?\n\n791\n00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:40,980\nOkay.\n\n792\n00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:47,160\nIf you forget your password then there\nis no way for you to decrypt your drive.\n\n793\n00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:49,200\nThat's how you decrypt\nthe drive is by authenticating.\n\n794\n00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:52,040\nThe decryption key is attached\nto your user account and\n\n795\n00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:55,480\nif you can't log in as your user account,\nyou are in big trouble.\n\n796\n00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:57,980\nAll right?\nYou can't decrypt the drive.\n\n797\n00:40:57,980 --> 00:40:59,420\nSo Apple gives you a safety net.\n\n798\n00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:01,050\nA back up plan.\n\n799\n00:41:01,050 --> 00:41:02,910\nThe backup plan is this guy right here.\n\n800\n00:41:02,910 --> 00:41:05,130\nThis is what's called a recovery key.\n\n801\n00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:06,130\nAll right.\n\n802\n00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:08,400\nWrite this key down.\n\n803\n00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,080\nPut it somewhere secure.\n\n804\n00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:13,590\nWith this key,\nif you forget your password,\n\n805\n00:41:13,590 --> 00:41:17,000\nyou can use this key to\ndecrypt your hard drive.\n\n806\n00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:17,550\nAll right.\nAnd\n\n807\n00:41:17,550 --> 00:41:20,170\nthen you can get into reset\nyour user password and\n\n808\n00:41:20,170 --> 00:41:21,630\ngain access to the system again.\n\n809\n00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:22,350\nAll right.\n\n810\n00:41:22,350 --> 00:41:23,890\nThis is the only way.\n\n811\n00:41:23,890 --> 00:41:27,940\nIf you don't want to have that safety net,\nyou don't have to.\n\n812\n00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:29,080\nYou can just click Continue.\n\n813\n00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:33,030\nDon't write it down,\njust move on past it, all right.\n\n814\n00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:35,860\nBut if you want to have that safety net,\nyou need to write this down.\n\n815\n00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:37,130\nNow here's the problem.\n\n816\n00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:39,980\nIf you write this down and you leave it on\na piece of paper sitting on your desk and\n\n817\n00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:41,520\nsomebody else gets it?\n\n818\n00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:43,390\nNow they can decrypt your drive.\n\n819\n00:41:43,390 --> 00:41:45,120\nSo this is very sensitive.\n\n820\n00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:49,230\nYou need to write this down and\nthen store it somewhere secure.\n\n821\n00:41:49,230 --> 00:41:51,140\nPut it in a vault, lock it somewhere,\n\n822\n00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:53,460\nsomewhere where nobody\nelse has access to it.\n\n823\n00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:55,880\nDo not email it to yourself.\n\n824\n00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:56,590\nA lot of people do that.\n\n825\n00:41:56,590 --> 00:41:58,700\nLike, I'll email it to myself,\nit'll be right there.\n\n826\n00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:01,520\nWell, your emails are not encrypted.\n\n827\n00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:04,860\nSo, people can see it in transit,\npeople can attack your mailbox and\n\n828\n00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:05,650\nget access to it.\n\n829\n00:42:05,650 --> 00:42:07,370\nDo not email it to yourself.\n\n830\n00:42:07,370 --> 00:42:11,090\nWrite it on a piece of paper, stick the\npiece of paper somewhere secure, right?\n\n831\n00:42:11,090 --> 00:42:14,270\nOr if you're gonna save it to a text file,\nburn it to a CD or\n\n832\n00:42:14,270 --> 00:42:17,070\nDVD and then store the CD or\nDVD somewhere, right?\n\n833\n00:42:17,070 --> 00:42:19,460\nSo do some kind of secure storage for it.\n\n834\n00:42:21,225 --> 00:42:24,135\nIf you don't think that\nyou can do that all right.\n\n835\n00:42:24,135 --> 00:42:26,855\nIf you just don't have somewhere\nsecure that you can store it,\n\n836\n00:42:26,855 --> 00:42:27,935\nthere is another option.\n\n837\n00:42:27,935 --> 00:42:29,145\nOn the very next screen,\n\n838\n00:42:29,145 --> 00:42:33,945\nwhen I hit Continue, it's going to ask\nif I'd like to store it with Apple.\n\n839\n00:42:33,945 --> 00:42:38,857\nWe can store our FileVault\ndecryption key in iCloud.\n\n840\n00:42:38,857 --> 00:42:41,340\nAll right,\nwe can store it up on Apple servers.\n\n841\n00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:45,030\nThis is kind of a pro and\na con thing,right.\n\n842\n00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:49,235\nOn the pro side, we know that it's\nstored securely out there with Apple and\n\n843\n00:42:49,235 --> 00:42:50,786\nit's tied to our Apple ID.\n\n844\n00:42:50,786 --> 00:42:54,543\nSo if I ever get locked out of my system,\nI can't remember my password, I can use my\n\n845\n00:42:54,543 --> 00:42:57,809\nApple ID to gain access to this key and\nthen I can decrypt my hard drive and\n\n846\n00:42:57,809 --> 00:43:01,185\nI don't have to worry about storing\nit securely, Apple's doing that for\n\n847\n00:43:01,185 --> 00:43:02,640\nme, right?\n\n848\n00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:07,560\nThe negative side is Apple is a company\nthat's based in the United States of\n\n849\n00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:12,260\nAmerican and the U.S. government is\nvery aggressive about having these keys.\n\n850\n00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:14,905\nSo when you choose to store\nthose keys with Apple,\n\n851\n00:43:14,905 --> 00:43:18,320\nyou in turn are basically giving\nthem access to the U.S. government.\n\n852\n00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:20,650\nSo, if you're in the US, that's fine.\n\n853\n00:43:20,650 --> 00:43:21,950\nThey got all your stuff anyway, right?\n\n854\n00:43:21,950 --> 00:43:23,510\nWe have no privacy any more.\n\n855\n00:43:23,510 --> 00:43:25,870\nBut if you're outside of the US,\n\n856\n00:43:25,870 --> 00:43:27,610\nthat's probably not very\nattractive to you, right?\n\n857\n00:43:27,610 --> 00:43:29,210\nThat's probably not\nsomething that you want.\n\n858\n00:43:29,210 --> 00:43:34,750\nAnd so in that case, you probably don't\nwant to store them with Apple, okay?\n\n859\n00:43:34,750 --> 00:43:36,530\nSo, it's up to you how\nyou wanna go about that.\n\n860\n00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:37,970\nIf you do choose to store them with Apple,\n\n861\n00:43:37,970 --> 00:43:41,310\nyou'll see that it gives you\nthree security questions.\n\n862\n00:43:41,310 --> 00:43:44,480\nYou have to pick from\nan assortment of questions and\n\n863\n00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:49,520\nwhen you want to recover that key you\ncan get on the phone with Apple or\n\n864\n00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:53,260\naccess the site and\nanswer these three questions and\n\n865\n00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:57,070\nthen that will give you the key so that\nyou can decrypt your drive, all right.\n\n866\n00:43:57,070 --> 00:44:01,760\nI'm gonna say do not store with Apple for\nright now and we'll just continue.\n\n867\n00:44:03,490 --> 00:44:05,050\nThat's it for the setup.\n\n868\n00:44:05,050 --> 00:44:06,410\nNow that's it's done,\n\n869\n00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:10,250\nit needs to reboot the system\nto start the encryption process.\n\n870\n00:44:10,250 --> 00:44:13,830\nNow the way the encryption\nprocess works is really cool.\n\n871\n00:44:13,830 --> 00:44:15,150\nWatch how long it takes.\n\n872\n00:44:15,150 --> 00:44:18,430\nWhen I restart,\nmy system's going to reboot and\n\n873\n00:44:18,430 --> 00:44:21,060\nI'm not going to notice any\ndifference in the boot time.\n\n874\n00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:22,550\nThe boot's just going to happen.\n\n875\n00:44:22,550 --> 00:44:24,560\nIt'll come right up and\ntake me to my login screen.\n\n876\n00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:26,590\nEventually.\n\n877\n00:44:26,590 --> 00:44:27,750\nThere we go.\n\n878\n00:44:27,750 --> 00:44:28,640\nSo it's gonna reboot.\n\n879\n00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:32,340\nNow, when it reboots, it's gonna come up,\nand it's gonna come up really fast.\n\n880\n00:44:33,390 --> 00:44:35,330\nDid it just encrypt my whole hard drive?\n\n881\n00:44:35,330 --> 00:44:36,110\nNo.\n\n882\n00:44:36,110 --> 00:44:41,270\nWhat it did is, it just encrypted a small\npart of the drive that it needed to move\n\n883\n00:44:41,270 --> 00:44:45,670\nthe boot files, not the boot files,\nsorry, the hard disc access,\n\n884\n00:44:45,670 --> 00:44:48,110\nthe extensions that allow us\nto access the hard drive.\n\n885\n00:44:48,110 --> 00:44:49,960\nSo it moved those to an encrypted area.\n\n886\n00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:53,110\nNow it can boot, and\nit can take it's time and\n\n887\n00:44:53,110 --> 00:44:56,340\nmove the rest of my hard\ndrive into encrypted storage.\n\n888\n00:44:56,340 --> 00:45:00,640\nSo it's started to encrypt now, but\nit's doing it in the background.\n\n889\n00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:02,690\nSo you can keep using your system.\n\n890\n00:45:02,690 --> 00:45:05,950\nThat's important,\nbecause if you have an SSD, right,\n\n891\n00:45:05,950 --> 00:45:08,410\nso I'm on a Solid State Digital drive.\n\n892\n00:45:08,410 --> 00:45:13,010\nIt'll probably take 15 to 20\nminutes to encrypt my drive.\n\n893\n00:45:13,010 --> 00:45:14,390\nIf you're on a SATA drive,\n\n894\n00:45:14,390 --> 00:45:18,340\nthe traditional spinning drives,\nit could take hours to encrypt your drive.\n\n895\n00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:21,660\nThe more data you have on the drive,\nthe longer it'll take to encrypt, so\n\n896\n00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:22,770\njust be aware of that.\n\n897\n00:45:22,770 --> 00:45:26,100\nIt could happen very quickly on\nan SSD with not much storage.\n\n898\n00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:29,370\nIt could take a long time if you have\nlike a terabyte SATA drive with a ton\n\n899\n00:45:29,370 --> 00:45:30,220\nof data on it.\n\n900\n00:45:30,220 --> 00:45:31,200\nSo it could take hours.\n\n901\n00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:34,030\nSo that's why it's so important\nthat it happens in the background.\n\n902\n00:45:34,030 --> 00:45:36,320\nNow here I'm on my unlock screen and\n\n903\n00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:40,350\nnotice I don't see John Doe\nin the unlock list.\n\n904\n00:45:40,350 --> 00:45:42,620\nAnd that's because\nJohn Doe is not enabled.\n\n905\n00:45:42,620 --> 00:45:45,590\nHe doesn't have the encryption key,\nor decryption key.\n\n906\n00:45:45,590 --> 00:45:47,740\nHe can't decrypt the drive\nto get access to it.\n\n907\n00:45:47,740 --> 00:45:50,330\nBut, Help Desk and Don Pezet do.\n\n908\n00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:54,930\nSo, if I log in as Don Pizet,\nright, I'll punch in my password.\n\n909\n00:45:54,930 --> 00:45:56,430\nAnd now I log in as an n user,\n\n910\n00:45:56,430 --> 00:45:59,150\nI don't even notice that\nencryption was in the mix, do I?\n\n911\n00:45:59,150 --> 00:46:01,610\nI just log in and off we go.\n\n912\n00:46:01,610 --> 00:46:05,670\nBut notice I logged in and\nnow I'm seeing the boot screen.\n\n913\n00:46:05,670 --> 00:46:09,060\nThis screen that shows the little\nspinning wheel would normally be\n\n914\n00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:10,700\nhere VMware is killing it.\n\n915\n00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:15,310\nBut normally I'd see that spinning wheel\nwell that's because I had to log in\n\n916\n00:46:15,310 --> 00:46:17,560\nprior to the operating system booting.\n\n917\n00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:20,820\nThe operating system hadn't\nactually booted at that stage.\n\n918\n00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:23,340\nNormally you see this screen first, and\n\n919\n00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:26,290\nthen you see the Mac OS login screen,\nright?\n\n920\n00:46:26,290 --> 00:46:30,570\nSo now things are reversed,\ncuz I had to unlock the system, right?\n\n921\n00:46:30,570 --> 00:46:35,580\nJohn Doe didn't have that access so\nhe couldn't unlock at that main screen.\n\n922\n00:46:35,580 --> 00:46:42,610\nNow once I get into my OS though,\nwhich is, anytime, there we go.\n\n923\n00:46:42,610 --> 00:46:43,940\nThis is the first time I've logged in so\n\n924\n00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:45,800\nit wants me to do my Apple ID\nwhich I'm not going to do.\n\n925\n00:46:48,350 --> 00:46:51,140\nThat Don Pezet account,\nI just created during the show earlier, so\n\n926\n00:46:51,140 --> 00:46:53,640\nit's never logged in before, so\nit's doing the Setting Up Your Mac.\n\n927\n00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:56,390\nNormally you won't see that if\nyou're just turning on encryption.\n\n928\n00:46:56,390 --> 00:46:58,500\nBut Don Pezet was able to log in,\nso here I am.\n\n929\n00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:02,290\nAnd as an end user,\ndo I know the drive's encrypted?\n\n930\n00:47:02,290 --> 00:47:04,650\nNo, I use it just like normal.\n\n931\n00:47:04,650 --> 00:47:07,290\nIn the background it's chugging along,\nencrypting my drive.\n\n932\n00:47:07,290 --> 00:47:09,830\nBut for me, I see my hard drive,\n\n933\n00:47:09,830 --> 00:47:14,290\nI just work with stuff and\nI don't even notice the difference, right?\n\n934\n00:47:14,290 --> 00:47:17,320\nTo me this is all the same as\nit's always been, all right?\n\n935\n00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:20,560\nSo that's why it's so easy to turn this\non, it's such a reliable thing to do, it's\n\n936\n00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:25,520\nwhy everybody should do it cuz there's\nreally no reason not to, all right.\n\n937\n00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:27,690\nNow, I'm logged in as Don Pezet.\n\n938\n00:47:27,690 --> 00:47:33,130\nIf I go to my login window now,\nnotice that I can log in as John Doe.\n\n939\n00:47:33,130 --> 00:47:35,180\nThe system is already booted up.\n\n940\n00:47:35,180 --> 00:47:36,874\nThe decryption key has been provided,\n\n941\n00:47:36,874 --> 00:47:39,093\nthe operating system has\naccess to the hard drive.\n\n942\n00:47:39,093 --> 00:47:44,142\nSo now even non-enabled users\ncan come in and log in and work.\n\n943\n00:47:44,142 --> 00:47:47,637\nSo a non-enabled user just\ncan't boot the system.\n\n944\n00:47:47,637 --> 00:47:52,312\nSo if I had a directory service like Open\nDirectory I could still use those users on\n\n945\n00:47:52,312 --> 00:47:56,140\nthe machine, they just wouldn't\nbe able to boot the system.\n\n946\n00:47:56,140 --> 00:47:59,630\nThey need to have a local account\nto be able to boot the system and\n\n947\n00:47:59,630 --> 00:48:01,505\nthen they could log in with\ntheir network account.\n\n948\n00:48:02,575 --> 00:48:05,555\nAnd yeah, I haven't logged in as this guy\neither, so let me just get past that.\n\n949\n00:48:05,555 --> 00:48:08,405\nAnd then we'll see that.\n\n950\n00:48:08,405 --> 00:48:12,335\nAll right, now I mentioned that FileVault\nis running in the background and\n\n951\n00:48:12,335 --> 00:48:13,855\nencrypting my drive.\n\n952\n00:48:13,855 --> 00:48:14,915\nHow do I know that, right?\n\n953\n00:48:14,915 --> 00:48:16,335\nHow do I know when it's done?\n\n954\n00:48:16,335 --> 00:48:19,035\nWell you do get a little notification\nbubble when it's done, but\n\n955\n00:48:19,035 --> 00:48:21,745\nif you're like me you like\nto stay on top of it.\n\n956\n00:48:21,745 --> 00:48:26,180\nSo you can go into your system preferences\nand go right back to the FileVault screen,\n\n957\n00:48:26,180 --> 00:48:32,450\nso System Preferences > Security and\nPrivacy, and the FileVault tab.\n\n958\n00:48:32,450 --> 00:48:34,720\nAnd on there, you'll see your status.\n\n959\n00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:37,440\nSo mine shows that it's encrypting,\nlooks like it's about a third of the way\n\n960\n00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:40,570\nthrough, and I've got an estimated\ntwo minutes remaining on mine.\n\n961\n00:48:40,570 --> 00:48:44,829\nNow I'm encrypting a virtual machine\nwith a hard drive that is, I think,\n\n962\n00:48:44,829 --> 00:48:46,008\nincredibly small.\n\n963\n00:48:46,008 --> 00:48:50,490\nI want to say it's 20 gigs or\nsomething, let's see how small it is.\n\n964\n00:48:50,490 --> 00:48:56,640\nIt is 27 gigs, or no actually its 40.\n\n965\n00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:58,630\nSo I've got a 40 gig hard drive and\n\n966\n00:48:58,630 --> 00:49:01,880\nit's on SSD so\nit's gonna encrypt pretty quickly.\n\n967\n00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:04,910\nIt's also mostly empty because I\nhaven't installed any software.\n\n968\n00:49:04,910 --> 00:49:08,380\nSo in real life land,\nthis could take hours.\n\n969\n00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:10,520\nWhat I normally do,\nlike when I encrypted my laptop.\n\n970\n00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:12,830\nNow I've got tons of data on my laptop.\n\n971\n00:49:12,830 --> 00:49:15,080\nAnd so what I did is one\nnight before going to bed,\n\n972\n00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:17,100\nI just turned on FileVault and\nthen went to bed.\n\n973\n00:49:17,100 --> 00:49:19,150\nAnd then in the morning,\nit was done, right?\n\n974\n00:49:19,150 --> 00:49:23,220\nBut the process could take hours\nif you've got a lot of data.\n\n975\n00:49:23,220 --> 00:49:25,610\nAll right now notice this little\nwarning that I've got down here.\n\n976\n00:49:25,610 --> 00:49:28,260\nSome users are not able\nto unlock the disc.\n\n977\n00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:32,330\nThat's just letting me know that I've got\nsome local users that aren't enabled.\n\n978\n00:49:32,330 --> 00:49:34,870\nI can ignore that if I want or\nI can go in and\n\n979\n00:49:34,870 --> 00:49:38,690\nI can add those other users if I want to.\n\n980\n00:49:40,630 --> 00:49:42,200\nIf I can remember my password.\n\n981\n00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:46,670\nSo I can go in here, and hit enable user,\nand we can enable some of the other users,\n\n982\n00:49:46,670 --> 00:49:47,990\nlike John Doe.\n\n983\n00:49:47,990 --> 00:49:49,950\nAnd we can enable them, and\nallow them to be crypted.\n\n984\n00:49:49,950 --> 00:49:53,660\nNow notice,\nI can't disable somebody, right?\n\n985\n00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:56,020\nIt doesn't show the people\nthat are already enabled.\n\n986\n00:49:56,020 --> 00:49:58,870\nAnd the reason is,\nthey've already got the encryption key.\n\n987\n00:49:58,870 --> 00:50:00,740\nThe encryption key is already in use.\n\n988\n00:50:00,740 --> 00:50:03,490\nYou can't take it away from them,\nthey already know it.\n\n989\n00:50:03,490 --> 00:50:08,880\nSo if you need to get rid of somebody\nyou've got to turn off FileVault,\n\n990\n00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:11,470\nwhich will decrypt the drive and\n\n991\n00:50:11,470 --> 00:50:16,990\nthen you can turn it back on again which\nwill re-encrypt it with a different key.\n\n992\n00:50:16,990 --> 00:50:20,880\nOkay that's how you disable users because\nthen you can pick the users again and\n\n993\n00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:22,610\nyou can exclude anybody you don't want.\n\n994\n00:50:22,610 --> 00:50:27,380\nSo it's a little bit of a challenging\nprocess but it's important because\n\n995\n00:50:27,380 --> 00:50:30,370\nyou gotta be encrypted with\na different key at that point.\n\n996\n00:50:30,370 --> 00:50:33,500\nSo but firewall pretty simple, right?\n\n997\n00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:35,260\nFor your average end user?\n\n998\n00:50:35,260 --> 00:50:38,280\nThey just come right into the screen,\nhit turn on FileVault.\n\n999\n00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:40,340\nThey're already checked for\nbeing enabled and\n\n1000\n00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:41,560\nthey just run through the process there.\n\n1001\n00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:43,030\nLet is reboot and you're done.\n\n1002\n00:50:43,030 --> 00:50:44,630\nIt's really easy to turn on.\n\n1003\n00:50:44,630 --> 00:50:47,688\nIn an enterprise environment we want\nto make sure we backup these keys,\n\n1004\n00:50:47,688 --> 00:50:48,890\nthese recovery keys.\n\n1005\n00:50:48,890 --> 00:50:52,520\nThat way if an employee does something\ncrazy, they change the passwords you can't\n\n1006\n00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:56,210\nget in, you still have that recovery\nkey to be able to get into the system.\n\n1007\n00:50:56,210 --> 00:50:58,780\nSo, a little bit of management there.\n\n1008\n00:50:58,780 --> 00:51:04,200\nYou can also control FileVault\nwith the profile manager.\n\n1009\n00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:09,320\nSo, if you have a Mac OS server set up\nsomewhere that's running the server app\n\n1010\n00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:12,750\nyou can use profile manager to push\nout profiles to do things like\n\n1011\n00:51:12,750 --> 00:51:16,635\nturn on FileVault, or turn it off, maybe\nyou just want to forbid people from using\n\n1012\n00:51:16,635 --> 00:51:19,272\nFileVault, you can do that too,\nall via the profile manager.\n\n1013\n00:51:19,272 --> 00:51:24,570\nAll right, it looks like this one's\nalmost done, there we go, now it's done,\n\n1014\n00:51:24,570 --> 00:51:29,130\nso it is done, my hard drive is encrypted.\n\n1015\n00:51:29,130 --> 00:51:33,090\nNow I didn't bother to write\ndown the recovery key, and\n\n1016\n00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:36,080\nI didn't choose to store\nit with Apple either.\n\n1017\n00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:38,310\nSo at this point, I have no recovery key.\n\n1018\n00:51:38,310 --> 00:51:42,780\nI guess I could go back and watch this\nepisode and I could get the recovery key\n\n1019\n00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:46,280\nfrom the video, but if I didn't have that,\nI've got no recovery key.\n\n1020\n00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:49,990\nSo, if I can't remember the password for\nan enabled user.\n\n1021\n00:51:49,990 --> 00:51:52,840\nIf I can't remember help desk's\npassword or Don Pizet's password,\n\n1022\n00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:55,740\nif I can't remember those,\nI'm locked out of this system and\n\n1023\n00:51:55,740 --> 00:51:57,580\nthere's no way that it can be recovered.\n\n1024\n00:51:57,580 --> 00:52:02,550\nIf you take it to the Apple store,\nthey'll offer to format the machine and\n\n1025\n00:52:02,550 --> 00:52:05,170\nreload Mac OS on there, but\nyou've lost your data at that point.\n\n1026\n00:52:05,170 --> 00:52:07,630\nNow, if you've got\nTime Machine back-ups or\n\n1027\n00:52:07,630 --> 00:52:11,240\nif you've been backing up to iCloud,\nthen you can re-install Mac OS and\n\n1028\n00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:14,700\nthen you'll just restore your Time Machine\nbackup, or you'll restore from iCloud and\n\n1029\n00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:18,010\nyou're back in business, so\nit's not the end of the world, right?\n\n1030\n00:52:18,010 --> 00:52:22,020\nBut an attacker who steals you laptop,\nare they gonna have access to your iCloud,\n\n1031\n00:52:22,020 --> 00:52:24,470\nare they gonna have access to\nyour Time Machine backups?\n\n1032\n00:52:24,470 --> 00:52:25,090\nNo.\n\n1033\n00:52:25,090 --> 00:52:28,070\nSo they just have this\nencrypted hard drive.\n\n1034\n00:52:28,070 --> 00:52:32,100\nAnd so when they get it,\nthey can't do anything with it except\n\n1035\n00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:35,620\nformat the machine and install Mac OS and\nthen sell your laptop on eBay.\n\n1036\n00:52:35,620 --> 00:52:36,680\nThat's what they normally do.\n\n1037\n00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:39,420\nSo that's kind of\nthe route that goes there.\n\n1038\n00:52:40,690 --> 00:52:43,370\nAll right so now I'm running FileVault,\nI'm in business.\n\n1039\n00:52:43,370 --> 00:52:45,290\nNot much else to do.\n\n1040\n00:52:45,290 --> 00:52:49,190\nNow the tab does say just plain old\nFileVault, that's all it says, but\n\n1041\n00:52:49,190 --> 00:52:51,340\nthis is actually FileVault 2.\n\n1042\n00:52:51,340 --> 00:52:55,441\nIn Maverick's we've got FileVault version\n2 which is a little bit stronger.\n\n1043\n00:52:55,441 --> 00:52:57,585\nIt uses AES-128 encryption.\n\n1044\n00:52:57,585 --> 00:52:59,925\nIt's a good thing to remember for\nthe exam.\n\n1045\n00:52:59,925 --> 00:53:02,965\nBut AES-128 encryption,\nwhich is pretty strong.\n\n1046\n00:53:02,965 --> 00:53:06,905\nThere are stronger ones that are out\nthere, but the stronger the encryption\n\n1047\n00:53:06,905 --> 00:53:10,545\nalgorithm you use, the more of\na performance hit that you take.\n\n1048\n00:53:10,545 --> 00:53:15,520\nAnd so Apple had to pick a balance, a\nbalance between performance and security.\n\n1049\n00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:17,600\nAs it stands AES-128,\n\n1050\n00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:23,110\nif someone were to use a single computer\nto try and break your encryption key,\n\n1051\n00:53:23,110 --> 00:53:29,380\nit would take over 2 billion years for\none computer to break that key.\n\n1052\n00:53:29,380 --> 00:53:33,280\nA distributed attack might leverage\nthousands of machines and so you're still\n\n1053\n00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:38,640\ntalking about a time of over 100 million\nyears, so you're pretty safe, right?\n\n1054\n00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:40,400\nAES 128 is really safe.\n\n1055\n00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:43,760\nYou have a greater risk of\nhaving your key compromised.\n\n1056\n00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:48,220\nThat's why it's so important to store\nthat recovery key somewhere, and\n\n1057\n00:53:48,220 --> 00:53:49,930\nknow that that's the weakest link.\n\n1058\n00:53:49,930 --> 00:53:52,250\nIf somebody gets that recovery key,\nthey can get in, right?\n\n1059\n00:53:52,250 --> 00:53:56,340\nBut as long as you've got secure passwords\non your account FileVault provides\n\n1060\n00:53:56,340 --> 00:53:57,750\ngreat protection.\n\n1061\n00:53:57,750 --> 00:53:59,260\nAll right, there is always that option.\n\n1062\n00:53:59,260 --> 00:54:01,730\nSomebody could try and brute force\nyour password at the login screen.\n\n1063\n00:54:01,730 --> 00:54:04,950\nSo if you picked a weak password\nthen they could get in.\n\n1064\n00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:06,340\nSo keep that in mind too.\n\n1065\n00:54:06,340 --> 00:54:09,557\nYour own password becomes a weak\nlink in the security chain.\n\n1066\n00:54:11,310 --> 00:54:14,140\nAll right well that is FileVault.\n\n1067\n00:54:14,140 --> 00:54:18,130\nI've got a few other things on my list\nhere to cover, but looking at the timer,\n\n1068\n00:54:18,130 --> 00:54:20,820\nthis is a pretty good spot to stop and\ntake a break.\n\n1069\n00:54:20,820 --> 00:54:23,790\nAfter the break,\nI wanna take a look at the firewall and\n\n1070\n00:54:23,790 --> 00:54:27,840\ngatekeeper that are built into Mac OS,\nwhich has some pretty cool features.\n\n1071\n00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:34,015\nSo, let's stop here and take a break, when\nwe get back, more security after this.\n\n1072\n00:54:34,015 --> 00:54:42,410\n>> [SOUND]\n>> All right, welcome back, everybody.\n\n1073\n00:54:42,410 --> 00:54:44,760\nSo, in this segment,\nI want to take a look at some of the,\n\n1074\n00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:47,580\njust the grab bag of security\nfeatures that we have.\n\n1075\n00:54:47,580 --> 00:54:50,960\nI got a handful of other ones that we're\nnot going to go into crazy depth on, but\n\n1076\n00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:56,370\nwe need to be familiar with, lots of\nlittle bells and whistles waiting for us.\n\n1077\n00:54:56,370 --> 00:54:58,620\nBut first what I want to talk about is\none of the easiest because we don't\n\n1078\n00:54:58,620 --> 00:55:01,430\nreally have to do anything and\nthat's antivirus.\n\n1079\n00:55:01,430 --> 00:55:04,566\nAll right, you know there are a lot\nof viruses, worms, trojans,\n\n1080\n00:55:04,566 --> 00:55:09,160\nthings like that that are out there on the\ninternet and every computer Is vulnerable.\n\n1081\n00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:14,770\nAnd for a very, very long time, the Mac OS\nworld has been pretty insulated from that.\n\n1082\n00:55:14,770 --> 00:55:19,330\nWe just haven't seen a large proliferation\nin those types of viruses in\n\n1083\n00:55:19,330 --> 00:55:20,800\nthe Mac world, all right.\n\n1084\n00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:23,440\nSo the mantra for the longest time was,\nwe don't need anti-virus.\n\n1085\n00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:27,180\nThe main reason was simply because\nthe market share of Mac OS was so\n\n1086\n00:55:27,180 --> 00:55:29,660\nsmall that it just wasn't\na very viable target.\n\n1087\n00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:32,240\nWell that market share is much larger now.\n\n1088\n00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:34,040\nIt's become a bigger target.\n\n1089\n00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:36,090\nSo we are starting to see some viruses and\n\n1090\n00:55:36,090 --> 00:55:40,147\nexploits that are out there that are\nstarting to target the Mac OS environment.\n\n1091\n00:55:40,147 --> 00:55:43,792\nWell fortunately, Apple is taking\na very proactive stance on that.\n\n1092\n00:55:43,792 --> 00:55:48,843\nAnd so when a new virus is detected or\nsome attack like that.\n\n1093\n00:55:48,843 --> 00:55:53,225\nApple comes up with a fix and a patch,\nso a patch to stop it from spreading and\n\n1094\n00:55:53,225 --> 00:55:56,495\na fix to correct people that\nwere already infected, and\n\n1095\n00:55:56,495 --> 00:55:59,410\nthey push it out with\nthe software updates.\n\n1096\n00:55:59,410 --> 00:56:01,650\nSo as long as you're doing\nyour software updates for\n\n1097\n00:56:01,650 --> 00:56:05,390\nyour operating system,\nthe various viruses, Trojans, worms,\n\n1098\n00:56:05,390 --> 00:56:07,962\nthings like that that are out\nthere are gonna be blocked.\n\n1099\n00:56:07,962 --> 00:56:11,220\nThey're gonna be stopped from infecting\nyour machine and that'll take care of it.\n\n1100\n00:56:11,220 --> 00:56:12,820\nSo what do we need to do?\n\n1101\n00:56:13,860 --> 00:56:14,950\nJust do our updates.\n\n1102\n00:56:14,950 --> 00:56:17,430\nYou don't actually have to configure it,\nyou don't turn it on, anything like that,\n\n1103\n00:56:17,430 --> 00:56:20,000\nit's just a part of the update system.\n\n1104\n00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,940\nSo when it comes to antivirus,\nthat's really it.\n\n1105\n00:56:22,940 --> 00:56:25,710\nThey do mention in the book for\nthis course that,\n\n1106\n00:56:25,710 --> 00:56:30,040\nthere are a couple of third party\nantivirus solutions that are out there.\n\n1107\n00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:32,267\nI know Symantec has one, and\na couple other companies.\n\n1108\n00:56:32,267 --> 00:56:36,360\nYou can certainly run those if you like,\nbut it's not necessary for\n\n1109\n00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:39,590\nmost environments because as long\nas you're doing your updates,\n\n1110\n00:56:39,590 --> 00:56:40,390\nyou should be taken care of.\n\n1111\n00:56:41,810 --> 00:56:46,280\nAll right, the other thing,\nI wanna talk about is Gatekeeper viruses.\n\n1112\n00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:50,410\nViruses can spread on their own across\nthe network, but more often than not,\n\n1113\n00:56:50,410 --> 00:56:52,980\nwe see viruses in the form of Trojans.\n\n1114\n00:56:52,980 --> 00:56:57,190\nAn end user goes to install software,\nthinking it's one thing and\n\n1115\n00:56:57,190 --> 00:56:58,880\nit's actually something else.\n\n1116\n00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:03,260\nOr they install the software they wanted,\nbut piggy backing along with that software\n\n1117\n00:57:03,260 --> 00:57:06,430\nis malicious software that\nthey're now going to install.\n\n1118\n00:57:06,430 --> 00:57:09,890\nSo in Mac OS we have a little\nservice called Gatekeeper.\n\n1119\n00:57:09,890 --> 00:57:11,350\nAnd Gatekeeper, if I can say it,\n\n1120\n00:57:11,350 --> 00:57:15,570\nit's another one of those that's super\neasy because it's on by default.\n\n1121\n00:57:15,570 --> 00:57:16,760\nWe don't have to turn it on.\n\n1122\n00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:19,220\nWe don't have to configure it,\nalthough we can.\n\n1123\n00:57:19,220 --> 00:57:23,690\nThe was that it works is when\nyou get a new Mac OS machine,\n\n1124\n00:57:23,690 --> 00:57:28,760\nit will let you run programs that are from\nthe App Store, and it will let you\n\n1125\n00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:33,760\nrun programs that are from known\ndevelopers that Apple has dealt with.\n\n1126\n00:57:34,980 --> 00:57:37,280\nAnd those are programs you're\ngonna be allowed to run.\n\n1127\n00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:39,660\nAny other program,\nany other App that you try and\n\n1128\n00:57:39,660 --> 00:57:41,780\nrun from any other source will be blocked.\n\n1129\n00:57:42,850 --> 00:57:45,810\nAnd that's the nature of Gatekeeper.\n\n1130\n00:57:45,810 --> 00:57:50,090\nGatekeeper is saying hey, if you get\nan App from the Apple App Store,\n\n1131\n00:57:50,090 --> 00:57:53,000\nthat had to pass the App Store\napproval process, so\n\n1132\n00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:56,780\nit's already been looked at, we know\nthe software is safe, you can run that.\n\n1133\n00:57:56,780 --> 00:58:01,170\nAnd Apple's official stance is the safest\nplace to get software is the App Store.\n\n1134\n00:58:01,170 --> 00:58:04,980\nSo that does need to be our number\none place to go and get Apps.\n\n1135\n00:58:06,130 --> 00:58:07,750\nBut not everything is in the App Store.\n\n1136\n00:58:07,750 --> 00:58:10,630\nSo we may need to get things from\nindividual vendor web sites,\n\n1137\n00:58:10,630 --> 00:58:12,100\nthings like that.\n\n1138\n00:58:12,100 --> 00:58:17,404\nWhen that happens, whoever developed that\nsoftware can register with Apple and\n\n1139\n00:58:17,404 --> 00:58:19,205\nget an Apple developer ID.\n\n1140\n00:58:19,205 --> 00:58:23,610\nAnd when they compile their software,\nthey can digitally sign it.\n\n1141\n00:58:23,610 --> 00:58:27,480\nThey basically use like an SSL\ncertificate, but it's not SSL.\n\n1142\n00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:31,841\nSo they use a certificate to digitally\nsign it with their developer ID.\n\n1143\n00:58:31,841 --> 00:58:33,639\nAnd when you run that app on your Mac,\n\n1144\n00:58:33,639 --> 00:58:37,468\nit'll see the developer ID in the\ncertificate, it'll run it against Apple,\n\n1145\n00:58:37,468 --> 00:58:40,730\nand if it says that it's valid,\nthen you can run the application.\n\n1146\n00:58:41,890 --> 00:58:47,600\nBut if you get a non-signed application\nfrom somewhere, it'll be blocked.\n\n1147\n00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:52,800\nAnd it happens, even with legitimate\nsoftware, it's just stuff that\n\n1148\n00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:58,730\nis not necessarily, well and\nI'm trying to think of the,\n\n1149\n00:58:58,730 --> 00:59:01,250\nbest way to phrase this where\nI don't insult any software.\n\n1150\n00:59:01,250 --> 00:59:04,810\nWe normally see it with\nOpen Source projects.\n\n1151\n00:59:04,810 --> 00:59:06,950\nOpen Source projects that don't\nhave a ton of funding and\n\n1152\n00:59:06,950 --> 00:59:10,490\ndon't wanna go through the App approval\nprocess with Apple or you see it with\n\n1153\n00:59:10,490 --> 00:59:14,170\napplications that are updated super\nfrequently, because they don't wanna\n\n1154\n00:59:14,170 --> 00:59:17,850\ngo through the process of getting approved\nthrough Apple for every single update.\n\n1155\n00:59:17,850 --> 00:59:21,800\nSo you'll see some software out there\nwhere they choose not to use the App Store\n\n1156\n00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:24,640\nand may not even digitally\nsign with a developer ID.\n\n1157\n00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:29,960\nAnd so in those scenarios, we might need\nto override the Gatekeeper functionality.\n\n1158\n00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:33,532\nSo the Gatekeeper functionality,\nlet's take a look at that default first.\n\n1159\n00:59:33,532 --> 00:59:36,290\nI'm gonna go into my system preferences,\nand\n\n1160\n00:59:36,290 --> 00:59:39,100\nthen I'm gonna go into my Security and\nPrivacy.\n\n1161\n00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:45,180\nAnd if I go back to my general tab,\nthe Gatekeeper\n\n1162\n00:59:45,180 --> 00:59:49,550\nsettings are right here at the bottom,\nand notice mine are at the default.\n\n1163\n00:59:49,550 --> 00:59:52,860\nLet me unlock this real quick.\n\n1164\n00:59:52,860 --> 00:59:57,240\nMine's in the default which says\nMac App Store and identify developers.\n\n1165\n00:59:57,240 --> 01:00:00,800\nSo any App I get from the App Store's\nallowed to run, and any App,\n\n1166\n01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:05,580\nI get from an identified developer,\nsomebody who got authorized with Apple,\n\n1167\n01:00:05,580 --> 01:00:08,310\nwho digitally signed their software,\nI will be able to run their software.\n\n1168\n01:00:09,790 --> 01:00:12,760\nMac App Store would cut\nout the developers.\n\n1169\n01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:16,485\nNow, I will only allow Apps to run\nthat were pulled from the App Store.\n\n1170\n01:00:18,105 --> 01:00:21,545\nAnd notice, when I chose that it's sitting\nhere and thinking for a moment, and\n\n1171\n01:00:21,545 --> 01:00:24,605\nthat's because it's a pretty\nsignificant change on the backend to\n\n1172\n01:00:24,605 --> 01:00:28,125\nget the system to start blocking\nall of these unauthorized apps.\n\n1173\n01:00:28,125 --> 01:00:30,375\nI could've also chosen Anywhere.\n\n1174\n01:00:30,375 --> 01:00:34,165\nAnd had I chosen Anywhere,\nthen that would let any App run.\n\n1175\n01:00:34,165 --> 01:00:36,750\nAnd see,\nhow I just got sound error up there?\n\n1176\n01:00:36,750 --> 01:00:38,010\nI'm running VMware.\n\n1177\n01:00:38,010 --> 01:00:41,580\nAnd so when I flip to Mac App Store,\nmy VMware tools,\n\n1178\n01:00:41,580 --> 01:00:46,090\nthe extensions that allow my system to\npower, they are identified developers,\n\n1179\n01:00:46,090 --> 01:00:47,560\nthey're allowed to run normally.\n\n1180\n01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:50,050\nNow, I just blocked them,\nand so my sound card died.\n\n1181\n01:00:50,050 --> 01:00:54,433\nSo blocking some of those other Apps\ncan have some unexpected consequences\n\n1182\n01:00:54,433 --> 01:00:55,180\nsometimes.\n\n1183\n01:00:55,180 --> 01:00:56,730\nWe've gotta be careful with that.\n\n1184\n01:00:58,220 --> 01:01:01,110\nNow, what if I have an app that I want\nto run that's not digitally signed, and\n\n1185\n01:01:01,110 --> 01:01:02,450\nI need to run it?\n\n1186\n01:01:02,450 --> 01:01:05,510\nWell, we can override the gatekeeper.\n\n1187\n01:01:05,510 --> 01:01:09,560\nIf you go and get an App,\nlet's see if I could find one.\n\n1188\n01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:10,850\nWho would not sign their App?\n\n1189\n01:01:10,850 --> 01:01:11,780\nI bet VLC.\n\n1190\n01:01:12,790 --> 01:01:15,510\nThere's an organization called VideoLAN.\n\n1191\n01:01:15,510 --> 01:01:17,610\nAnd they make a video player called VLC.\n\n1192\n01:01:17,610 --> 01:01:19,880\nIt's a very popular video player.\n\n1193\n01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:20,880\nIt's open source.\n\n1194\n01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:26,065\nAnd it uses some decoding libraries\nthat are legal in some countries,\n\n1195\n01:01:26,065 --> 01:01:29,145\nnot legal in some other countries,\nso they're of a debatable backgroun.\n\n1196\n01:01:29,145 --> 01:01:32,945\nSo that's the exact type of thing\nthat Apple wouldn't like to approve.\n\n1197\n01:01:32,945 --> 01:01:34,065\nSo I don't know for certain, but\n\n1198\n01:01:34,065 --> 01:01:37,405\nI assume that they are not\ndigitally signing their stuff.\n\n1199\n01:01:37,405 --> 01:01:40,385\nSo I am just downloading it real quick,\nand we'll try and run it.\n\n1200\n01:01:41,555 --> 01:01:44,930\nNow, when I go to run it,\nif it's digitally signed,\n\n1201\n01:01:44,930 --> 01:01:47,120\nthen my system's gonna say okay,\nand let it run.\n\n1202\n01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:51,250\nBut if it's not, I'm gonna get a message\ntelling me that it's not allowed to run\n\n1203\n01:01:51,250 --> 01:01:53,880\nbecause it's not from a trusted\ndeveloper or from the App Store.\n\n1204\n01:01:55,120 --> 01:01:56,910\nLooks like that download\nis almost done there.\n\n1205\n01:01:58,310 --> 01:02:01,890\nThat last little bit of a download\nalways seems to take forever.\n\n1206\n01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:04,730\nNow, I'm gonna get impatient and\nI'm gonna mess it up.\n\n1207\n01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:08,897\nThat's what generally happens.\n\n1208\n01:02:08,897 --> 01:02:10,267\nOh, come on.\n\n1209\n01:02:10,267 --> 01:02:15,120\n[LAUGH] It's gonna sit\nright here like 99%.\n\n1210\n01:02:15,120 --> 01:02:17,840\nSo when it's done though,\nI'm gonna install this software.\n\n1211\n01:02:17,840 --> 01:02:21,210\nMost installers you're just dragging\nan application into your application\n\n1212\n01:02:21,210 --> 01:02:22,010\nfolder, right?\n\n1213\n01:02:22,010 --> 01:02:24,610\nThat's basically it, and\nyou can do that with any App.\n\n1214\n01:02:24,610 --> 01:02:27,750\nGatekeeper does not stop you\nfrom installing programs.\n\n1215\n01:02:27,750 --> 01:02:29,800\nYou can drag it over and throw it.\n\n1216\n01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:31,108\nSee here.\nI'll do that right now.\n\n1217\n01:02:31,108 --> 01:02:36,600\nSo I'm gonna pull up VLC and\nI'm going to install the software.\n\n1218\n01:02:37,710 --> 01:02:39,560\nSo as soon as that is up, I will do it.\n\n1219\n01:02:39,560 --> 01:02:40,430\nThere we go.\n\n1220\n01:02:40,430 --> 01:02:44,780\nAnd so I'm just gonna drag VLC and\nchuck it into my applications.\n\n1221\n01:02:44,780 --> 01:02:48,492\nLooks like I need to authenticate\nas an administrator real quick.\n\n1222\n01:02:51,094 --> 01:02:55,060\nOh, that's right, I'm logged in as John\nDoe, that's why it made me authenticate.\n\n1223\n01:02:55,060 --> 01:02:57,070\nSo I'm just gonna throw that in there.\n\n1224\n01:02:57,070 --> 01:03:02,180\nNow, random App I got off the Internet,\nnot from the Apple App Store, and\n\n1225\n01:03:02,180 --> 01:03:06,960\nif I go into my,\nif I get my Mac angry at me.\n\n1226\n01:03:09,050 --> 01:03:13,807\nIf I go into my applications, whenever\nit let's me, I'll see VLC is in there.\n\n1227\n01:03:13,807 --> 01:03:16,193\nAnd then, I'll try and run it and that's\nwhen we're gonna find out whether or\n\n1228\n01:03:16,193 --> 01:03:17,110\nnot it's digitally signed.\n\n1229\n01:03:19,650 --> 01:03:23,380\nWell, whenever the system\ndecides to let me do that.\n\n1230\n01:03:23,380 --> 01:03:26,470\nNow, one of the things that\nI'm bumping into here is,\n\n1231\n01:03:26,470 --> 01:03:28,900\nwe encrypted my hard drive\nin that last segment.\n\n1232\n01:03:28,900 --> 01:03:32,596\nAnd I'm doing it in VMWare, so\nit's actually doing the encryption and\n\n1233\n01:03:32,596 --> 01:03:33,957\ndecryption in software.\n\n1234\n01:03:33,957 --> 01:03:36,630\nAnd so that might be causing a bit\nof my performance hit there.\n\n1235\n01:03:36,630 --> 01:03:39,505\nNormally, you're doing it in hardware,\non your actual system, and\n\n1236\n01:03:39,505 --> 01:03:41,565\nso you don't see that\nperformance degradation.\n\n1237\n01:03:41,565 --> 01:03:43,388\nThat's probably what's going on there.\n\n1238\n01:03:43,388 --> 01:03:46,349\nAll right, so I'm gonna go in here and\nI'm gonna try and run VLC.\n\n1239\n01:03:46,349 --> 01:03:50,720\nNow, when I run it- If it was an\nauthorized application, then it would run,\n\n1240\n01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:55,431\nbut in this case, I'm seeing it's an\napplication downloaded from the Internet,\n\n1241\n01:03:55,431 --> 01:03:57,690\nare you sure you want to open it?\n\n1242\n01:03:57,690 --> 01:03:59,150\nAnd I've got that open button.\n\n1243\n01:03:59,150 --> 01:03:59,720\nAll right.\n\n1244\n01:03:59,720 --> 01:04:05,030\nThis is the warning that I get because\nthe software is not from the app store and\n\n1245\n01:04:05,030 --> 01:04:06,420\nit's not authorized.\n\n1246\n01:04:06,420 --> 01:04:10,460\nNow I've provided administrative\ncredentials just a few seconds ago, so\n\n1247\n01:04:10,460 --> 01:04:14,910\nit's still got me flagged as administrator\nand I can hit that open button and do it.\n\n1248\n01:04:14,910 --> 01:04:18,250\nIf I hadn't authenticated as\nan administrator a moment ago,\n\n1249\n01:04:18,250 --> 01:04:22,190\nI wouldn't even see that open button, I\nwould just see this message warning me and\n\n1250\n01:04:22,190 --> 01:04:22,790\nthat would be it.\n\n1251\n01:04:22,790 --> 01:04:26,200\nI'd not be able to fire it up, all right.\n\n1252\n01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:29,690\nSo, what happens if I don't see that\nmessage, and I really want to open it?\n\n1253\n01:04:29,690 --> 01:04:35,340\nThe normal way to bypass gatekeeper is if\nyou do a command click on the application.\n\n1254\n01:04:38,680 --> 01:04:42,520\nI'm gonna try really hard to do my\ncommand click on the application.\n\n1255\n01:04:42,520 --> 01:04:43,460\nThere we go.\n\n1256\n01:04:43,460 --> 01:04:47,161\nAnd when you do a command click or a right\nclick if you've got a mouse with the right\n\n1257\n01:04:47,161 --> 01:04:50,500\nclick on it, you can do a command click,\nand in here you can choose open.\n\n1258\n01:04:50,500 --> 01:04:54,680\nAnd when you choose open like that,\nthat is gonna create\n\n1259\n01:04:54,680 --> 01:04:58,670\nan exception in the gatekeeper for\nthat application, all right.\n\n1260\n01:04:58,670 --> 01:05:01,930\nSo if you just double click on the app,\nit's gonna try and open it and\n\n1261\n01:05:01,930 --> 01:05:04,440\ngatekeeper might block it,\nbut if you right click and\n\n1262\n01:05:04,440 --> 01:05:08,550\nchoose open, that will bypass gatekeeper\nand add it to the exception list.\n\n1263\n01:05:08,550 --> 01:05:10,600\nSo I've got my little open button there.\n\n1264\n01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:11,780\nAnd I'll hit that.\n\n1265\n01:05:11,780 --> 01:05:16,370\nAnd now there's my VLC Player fired\nright up and I can access it.\n\n1266\n01:05:16,370 --> 01:05:19,370\nFor now on, there's an exception for VLC.\n\n1267\n01:05:19,370 --> 01:05:21,940\nSo, if I go and fire that up,\nI didn't really exit there.\n\n1268\n01:05:21,940 --> 01:05:22,890\nLet me do that again.\n\n1269\n01:05:22,890 --> 01:05:23,530\nThere.\n\n1270\n01:05:23,530 --> 01:05:27,140\nSo, if I fire that up,\nI'm not getting my warning about the app.\n\n1271\n01:05:27,140 --> 01:05:27,870\nThe app's already running.\n\n1272\n01:05:27,870 --> 01:05:31,650\nNow it's trying to do updates, but\nit runs and I don't get the warning.\n\n1273\n01:05:31,650 --> 01:05:34,720\nThe exception has been put in for\nGatekeeper, all right.\n\n1274\n01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:39,130\nSo, it's super easy to bypass this if\nsomebody has administrative access to\n\n1275\n01:05:39,130 --> 01:05:41,930\ntheir machine they can bypass\nthe gatekeeper pretty easy.\n\n1276\n01:05:41,930 --> 01:05:46,490\nIf you want to enforce the Gatekeeper, you\nreally need to use the profile manager.\n\n1277\n01:05:46,490 --> 01:05:49,620\nWith profile manager you can\ncreate a policy that stops\n\n1278\n01:05:49,620 --> 01:05:51,170\npeople from overriding the Gatekeeper.\n\n1279\n01:05:52,260 --> 01:05:55,861\nSo, if they go and download some\napplication over the Internet,\n\n1280\n01:05:55,861 --> 01:05:58,746\nthey won't be able to run it and\nbypass Gatekeeper.\n\n1281\n01:05:58,746 --> 01:06:02,964\nAll right, okay, so that is Gatekeeper,\n\n1282\n01:06:02,964 --> 01:06:07,063\nnot too much more to\nsee on that one right,\n\n1283\n01:06:07,063 --> 01:06:11,063\nwhen we go into our system preferences.\n\n1284\n01:06:12,839 --> 01:06:17,340\nAnd into that Security and\nPrivacy and into the General tab.\n\n1285\n01:06:17,340 --> 01:06:20,590\nThe Gatekeeper, you just have a couple\nlittle buttons there and that's about it.\n\n1286\n01:06:20,590 --> 01:06:21,526\nNot too much to it.\n\n1287\n01:06:23,208 --> 01:06:27,310\nAll right, another one that can get\na lot more complex is the Firewall.\n\n1288\n01:06:27,310 --> 01:06:28,720\nSo I'll see right here on my Security and\n\n1289\n01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:31,680\nPrivacy screen I've also\ngot the Firewall option.\n\n1290\n01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:36,990\nMac OS includes a software based firewall\nas part of the operating system.\n\n1291\n01:06:36,990 --> 01:06:41,490\nAnd you can turn it on to control any\nconnection, any network connection,\n\n1292\n01:06:41,490 --> 01:06:43,730\ncoming in and out of your Mac.\n\n1293\n01:06:43,730 --> 01:06:44,830\nIt's a pretty handy thing to have.\n\n1294\n01:06:44,830 --> 01:06:47,000\nIf you've got a hardware firewall,\n\n1295\n01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:50,560\nyou might choose to rely on that\ninstead of the software firewall, but\n\n1296\n01:06:50,560 --> 01:06:54,360\nif you're somebody who travels a lot,\nyou go to hotels, conference centers,\n\n1297\n01:06:54,360 --> 01:06:58,100\nthings like that, you're not gonna tote\nyour hardware firewall around with you.\n\n1298\n01:06:58,100 --> 01:07:02,280\nSo this software firewall is nice because\nit works no matter where you are.\n\n1299\n01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:07,170\nWherever you go and log into a network,\nyour firewall is functional, all right.\n\n1300\n01:07:07,170 --> 01:07:11,739\nMine's turned off here by default,\nso I'm gonna turn it on.\n\n1301\n01:07:11,739 --> 01:07:14,650\nSo I'm just gonna hit that\nturn on firewall button.\n\n1302\n01:07:14,650 --> 01:07:17,210\nAnd that's going to turn it on\nwith a default configuration.\n\n1303\n01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:19,790\nAll right, so we'll let that turn on.\n\n1304\n01:07:19,790 --> 01:07:23,220\nAnd you know what, I'm going to\nswitch to a unencrypted machine here.\n\n1305\n01:07:23,220 --> 01:07:27,790\nOh no, actually you know what, it's not\nthe virtual machine that's the problem,\n\n1306\n01:07:27,790 --> 01:07:28,530\nit's my desktop.\n\n1307\n01:07:28,530 --> 01:07:30,200\nSo apparently I've done something, but\n\n1308\n01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:32,440\nI'll give it a second while\nthat firewall turns on.\n\n1309\n01:07:32,440 --> 01:07:34,480\nWhen it turns on it's got\na basic set of rules and\n\n1310\n01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:38,140\nthe basic set of rules state\nthat I can go anywhere I want,\n\n1311\n01:07:38,140 --> 01:07:43,140\nI can access whatever I want and\neverybody else cannot access me.\n\n1312\n01:07:43,140 --> 01:07:48,742\nSo it's got limitations put on the system\nto stop outside people from accessing me,\n\n1313\n01:07:48,742 --> 01:07:49,600\nall right?\n\n1314\n01:07:49,600 --> 01:07:51,920\nSo there it is,\nthe firewall is turned on, and\n\n1315\n01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:55,450\nI can go into the Firewall Options\nto actually see what's set.\n\n1316\n01:07:55,450 --> 01:07:59,520\nAnd so I've got block all\nincoming connections, and\n\n1317\n01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:04,990\nif I turn that on,\nno one will be able to connect to me.\n\n1318\n01:08:04,990 --> 01:08:09,130\nI'll have to put exceptions in\nto allow people to connect in.\n\n1319\n01:08:09,130 --> 01:08:13,140\nNow normally we want that off and\nthen we'll add in the exceptions.\n\n1320\n01:08:13,140 --> 01:08:14,835\nIf you don't have any exceptions,\n\n1321\n01:08:14,835 --> 01:08:17,728\nthen you basically are blocking\nall incoming connections.\n\n1322\n01:08:17,728 --> 01:08:22,055\nSo the default behavior is to\nblock those incoming connections,\n\n1323\n01:08:22,055 --> 01:08:25,830\nbut you have one big\nexception put in by default.\n\n1324\n01:08:25,830 --> 01:08:29,810\nAutomatically allow signed software\nto receive incoming connections.\n\n1325\n01:08:29,810 --> 01:08:32,820\nIf you install software\nfrom the app store, or\n\n1326\n01:08:32,820 --> 01:08:36,600\ndigitally signed software that was\nsigned by somebody with a valid Apple\n\n1327\n01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:40,940\ndeveloper ID, then that software\nis allowed to receive connections.\n\n1328\n01:08:40,940 --> 01:08:46,180\nNow, that's important, because what\nif you get software like Adium?\n\n1329\n01:08:46,180 --> 01:08:47,980\nAdium is a chat client.\n\n1330\n01:08:47,980 --> 01:08:48,480\nRight?\n\n1331\n01:08:48,480 --> 01:08:51,280\nOr, you get an email client,\nor something like that.\n\n1332\n01:08:51,280 --> 01:08:54,150\nIt needs to be able to receive messages.\n\n1333\n01:08:54,150 --> 01:08:56,790\nNow, it can reach out and\ngrab messages whenever it wants.\n\n1334\n01:08:56,790 --> 01:08:58,980\nWe allow those outgoing communications.\n\n1335\n01:08:58,980 --> 01:09:01,960\nBut it needs to be able to\nreceive notifications, too.\n\n1336\n01:09:01,960 --> 01:09:04,420\nAnd so signed software will\nbe allowed to do that,\n\n1337\n01:09:04,420 --> 01:09:07,170\nby default,\nyou can turn that off if you want.\n\n1338\n01:09:07,170 --> 01:09:10,380\nIf you do, then you just need to\ngo in here and add the exception.\n\n1339\n01:09:10,380 --> 01:09:12,012\nSo I can come in and I can add,\n\n1340\n01:09:12,012 --> 01:09:15,075\nand I pick a program I want\nto create an exception for.\n\n1341\n01:09:15,075 --> 01:09:17,990\nSo maybe I want to create an exception for\nVLC.\n\n1342\n01:09:17,990 --> 01:09:21,470\nSo I can add that in, and\nthen it says allow incoming connection.\n\n1343\n01:09:21,470 --> 01:09:25,460\nSo it will allow any connection that's\ntrying to reach out to VLC to be\n\n1344\n01:09:25,460 --> 01:09:27,600\nable to reach out and connect to it.\n\n1345\n01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:30,940\nBut you can tweak that and say block\nincoming connections if you're trying to\n\n1346\n01:09:30,940 --> 01:09:34,510\nblock this software from receiving\ncommunications from the outside world.\n\n1347\n01:09:34,510 --> 01:09:36,700\nSo you can kind of tweak\nthat to suit your needs.\n\n1348\n01:09:38,430 --> 01:09:42,008\nYou also have another option down here at\nthe bottom that says enable stealth mode.\n\n1349\n01:09:42,008 --> 01:09:46,320\nIf we turn that on our laptop will\nbasically become invisible to the network.\n\n1350\n01:09:46,320 --> 01:09:47,240\nAnd what do I mean by that?\n\n1351\n01:09:47,240 --> 01:09:51,590\nWell, we can scan our network to see\nwhat other machines are out there.\n\n1352\n01:09:51,590 --> 01:09:54,960\nWe can see if they've got shared folders,\nwe can do what are called pings,\n\n1353\n01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:57,750\njust to see if they're there and\nturned on, all right.\n\n1354\n01:09:57,750 --> 01:10:01,090\nNow normally you want that, you want other\npeople to be able to discover your machine\n\n1355\n01:10:01,090 --> 01:10:05,220\non the network to be able to facilitate\nfile sharing and things, but if you're in\n\n1356\n01:10:05,220 --> 01:10:09,890\na hotel, or you're at a conference center,\nyou're probably not doing file sharing.\n\n1357\n01:10:09,890 --> 01:10:11,457\nSo you can turn on stealth mode,\n\n1358\n01:10:11,457 --> 01:10:14,140\nand no one will be able to see\nthat your laptop is there.\n\n1359\n01:10:14,140 --> 01:10:15,570\nThey won't be able to ping it.\n\n1360\n01:10:15,570 --> 01:10:18,190\nThey won't be able to see\nfile shares that are there.\n\n1361\n01:10:18,190 --> 01:10:20,370\nThey won't be able to access the machine,\nright?\n\n1362\n01:10:20,370 --> 01:10:21,880\nWell, that's not entirely true.\n\n1363\n01:10:21,880 --> 01:10:25,980\nIf you put exceptions in here, and\nthey know what your IP address is,\n\n1364\n01:10:25,980 --> 01:10:27,330\nthey could build those connections.\n\n1365\n01:10:27,330 --> 01:10:29,160\nSo they would just have\nto know the information,\n\n1366\n01:10:29,160 --> 01:10:31,270\nthey wouldn't be able to discover it.\n\n1367\n01:10:31,270 --> 01:10:36,676\nSo you're really killing off discovery\nwhen you turn on stealth mode.\n\n1368\n01:10:36,676 --> 01:10:39,298\nAll right,\njust be aware with each of these settings,\n\n1369\n01:10:39,298 --> 01:10:43,890\nthat if you start to tweak these settings,\nit's possible you can break your software.\n\n1370\n01:10:43,890 --> 01:10:48,878\nSo for example, the Adium chat client, it\ncould reach out and get new chat messages.\n\n1371\n01:10:48,878 --> 01:10:53,099\nI can send chat messages, but I might\nnot be able to receive chat messages if\n\n1372\n01:10:53,099 --> 01:10:55,713\nI've blocked incoming connections to it,\nor\n\n1373\n01:10:55,713 --> 01:11:00,620\nif I'm blocking all incoming connections,\nthat's gonna stop those from coming in.\n\n1374\n01:11:01,770 --> 01:11:03,240\nAll right, so that's the Firewall,\n\n1375\n01:11:03,240 --> 01:11:05,900\nit's not the most powerful\nFirewall in the world.\n\n1376\n01:11:05,900 --> 01:11:09,190\nThere are alternative Firewalls that\nyou can load on your clients, but\n\n1377\n01:11:09,190 --> 01:11:11,510\nthis one gets the job done for\nmost people.\n\n1378\n01:11:11,510 --> 01:11:15,468\nSo, it will suit the needs to protect your\nsystem when you're on untrusted networks.\n\n1379\n01:11:15,468 --> 01:11:19,360\nSpeaking of untrusted networks,\nlet me just turn that off.\n\n1380\n01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:22,533\nSpeaking of untrusted networks, that\nbrings me to the last one that I want to\n\n1381\n01:11:22,533 --> 01:11:24,540\ntalk about in this segment,\nwhich is a VPN.\n\n1382\n01:11:24,540 --> 01:11:27,295\nA virtual private network.\n\n1383\n01:11:27,295 --> 01:11:30,684\nIf you're at a hotel or a conference\ncenter, you're on a wireless network,\n\n1384\n01:11:30,684 --> 01:11:33,344\nthat's likely public,\nthat other people have access to and\n\n1385\n01:11:33,344 --> 01:11:35,280\nyou don't know who those people are.\n\n1386\n01:11:35,280 --> 01:11:37,077\nYou don't know whether\nthey're trustworthy or not.\n\n1387\n01:11:37,077 --> 01:11:41,350\nYou need to protect your network data\nwhile you're on that public network, and\n\n1388\n01:11:41,350 --> 01:11:44,816\none of the best ways to do that is\nwith a virtual private network.\n\n1389\n01:11:44,816 --> 01:11:48,222\nA VPN creates a tunnel\nbetween your computer And\n\n1390\n01:11:48,222 --> 01:11:52,660\nusually your home office,\nback wherever it is that you work.\n\n1391\n01:11:52,660 --> 01:11:56,250\nAnd you can send all of your\ndata across that tunnel,\n\n1392\n01:11:56,250 --> 01:12:00,010\nto your office,\nto a network that you do trust.\n\n1393\n01:12:00,010 --> 01:12:04,580\nAnd while your data is in that tunnel,\nit's fully encrypted, all right?\n\n1394\n01:12:04,580 --> 01:12:07,550\nYour data that gets sent over\nthe network is not encrypted by default.\n\n1395\n01:12:07,550 --> 01:12:12,360\nYou can use things like SSL, or\nVPN tunnels to create that encryption.\n\n1396\n01:12:12,360 --> 01:12:14,930\nBut most of your traffic like\nbrowsing through web pages and\n\n1397\n01:12:14,930 --> 01:12:18,470\nsending email, all that stuff\nis not encrypted by default.\n\n1398\n01:12:18,470 --> 01:12:21,010\nSo the VPN tunnels really\nhelp to solve that.\n\n1399\n01:12:21,010 --> 01:12:24,490\nNow Apple has support for the major\nVPN protocols that are out there.\n\n1400\n01:12:24,490 --> 01:12:28,250\nIf I go back to my system preferences,\nand I go down to network\n\n1401\n01:12:29,530 --> 01:12:33,370\nI'll see my network adapters,\nand I can unlock.\n\n1402\n01:12:36,530 --> 01:12:39,760\nAnd I can add in a new network adapter\nwith the plus sign at the bottom.\n\n1403\n01:12:41,010 --> 01:12:44,620\nAnd when I add it in, I'll get a choice\nof different systems to pick from,\n\n1404\n01:12:44,620 --> 01:12:47,490\ndifferent networks that I can add in.\n\n1405\n01:12:47,490 --> 01:12:49,470\nAnd I'll see VPN in the list.\n\n1406\n01:12:49,470 --> 01:12:53,530\nAnd when I choose VPN,\nI'll see the ones that are supported.\n\n1407\n01:12:53,530 --> 01:12:55,540\nFor the exam you need to remember these.\n\n1408\n01:12:55,540 --> 01:13:00,770\nRemember that it supports L2TP,\nthat's the layer two tunneling protocol.\n\n1409\n01:13:00,770 --> 01:13:05,680\nIt also supports PPTP, which is\nthe point to point tunneling protocol.\n\n1410\n01:13:05,680 --> 01:13:09,770\nAnd then lastly it supports Cisco IPSAC.\n\n1411\n01:13:09,770 --> 01:13:13,996\nCisco firewalls run their own kind\nof customized version of IP set,\n\n1412\n01:13:13,996 --> 01:13:16,528\nthe internet protocol security suite.\n\n1413\n01:13:16,528 --> 01:13:20,650\nAnd so people who wanna support that\nhave to have custom support for it.\n\n1414\n01:13:20,650 --> 01:13:23,360\nCisco is the number one vendor for\nnetworking equipment out there.\n\n1415\n01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:25,240\nSo it's the one you're gonna\nrun into the most, and\n\n1416\n01:13:25,240 --> 01:13:28,460\nso Apple has direct support for that.\n\n1417\n01:13:28,460 --> 01:13:31,510\nSo the default here is it wants to add\na Bluetooth personal area network and\n\n1418\n01:13:31,510 --> 01:13:33,430\nI'm just gonna change that to VPN.\n\n1419\n01:13:33,430 --> 01:13:37,060\nAnd now I'll see my VPN choices,\n\n1420\n01:13:37,060 --> 01:13:41,750\nL2TP over IPsec, PPTP and Cisco IPsec.\n\n1421\n01:13:41,750 --> 01:13:45,820\nLayer 2 tunnelling protocol, it's\nactually using IPsec for its encryption.\n\n1422\n01:13:45,820 --> 01:13:48,130\nThat's why it says over IPsec.\n\n1423\n01:13:48,130 --> 01:13:50,520\nCisco IPsec doesn't use L2TP.\n\n1424\n01:13:50,520 --> 01:13:52,650\nIt just uses straight up IPsec, but\n\n1425\n01:13:52,650 --> 01:13:56,220\nthey're both customizations\nof IPsec itself, all right?\n\n1426\n01:13:56,220 --> 01:13:59,540\nSo I would just pick which ever\none it was that I was using.\n\n1427\n01:13:59,540 --> 01:14:01,410\nAnd then I would create it.\n\n1428\n01:14:01,410 --> 01:14:03,850\nSo here I'm gonna create\nan L2TP connection.\n\n1429\n01:14:03,850 --> 01:14:05,650\nWhen I create it, I'm not done.\n\n1430\n01:14:05,650 --> 01:14:10,090\nI need to specify the server, the VPN\nend point that I'm gonna connect to.\n\n1431\n01:14:10,090 --> 01:14:12,670\nSo right here,\nI'll see my configuration values.\n\n1432\n01:14:12,670 --> 01:14:18,610\nI've got a server so maybe I've got\nVPN.ITpro.tv and my account names.\n\n1433\n01:14:18,610 --> 01:14:23,790\nSo maybe I'll log in as dpezet, and I can\nspecify any other settings that I need to,\n\n1434\n01:14:23,790 --> 01:14:26,169\nto connect up to that VPN, all right?\n\n1435\n01:14:26,169 --> 01:14:29,962\nNow when I'm out on the road,\nI'll just punch this in,\n\n1436\n01:14:29,962 --> 01:14:32,000\nI might have a shared secret.\n\n1437\n01:14:33,140 --> 01:14:37,887\nThese are all values that we could\nget from our network admins.\n\n1438\n01:14:39,060 --> 01:14:41,270\nSo we punch in those VPN values.\n\n1439\n01:14:41,270 --> 01:14:43,540\nNow, whenever I'm out on the road and\n\n1440\n01:14:43,540 --> 01:14:47,200\ntraveling, I'm on a network that I don't\ntrust, I can fire up my VPN tunnel.\n\n1441\n01:14:47,200 --> 01:14:50,560\nAnd my connections will get\nsent over that VPN server.\n\n1442\n01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:51,670\nOr a VPN connection.\n\n1443\n01:14:51,670 --> 01:14:52,900\nAnd I'll know it's secure.\n\n1444\n01:14:52,900 --> 01:14:57,160\nI like to turn this option on right here,\nthe Show VPN status in the menu bar.\n\n1445\n01:14:57,160 --> 01:15:00,020\nBecause, that way when I'm traveling,\n\n1446\n01:15:00,020 --> 01:15:02,960\nI just have the little\nVPN icon right up there.\n\n1447\n01:15:02,960 --> 01:15:07,417\nAnd you can quickly click on it,\nand choose to connect to the VPN.\n\n1448\n01:15:07,417 --> 01:15:11,250\nAnd so it's easy to connect and\nget going, all right?\n\n1449\n01:15:11,250 --> 01:15:16,880\nNow, if you don't have a VPN server,\nthere is an easy solution, the Server app.\n\n1450\n01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:18,940\nIf you, $20 in the App Store,\n\n1451\n01:15:18,940 --> 01:15:24,400\nif you buy the Server app,\nIt has a VPN component to it.\n\n1452\n01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:28,160\nAnd so you can go in there, and you can\nset up a VPN server just using a server\n\n1453\n01:15:28,160 --> 01:15:32,660\napp, eventually, [LAUGH] so there we go.\n\n1454\n01:15:32,660 --> 01:15:34,750\nSo you'll see right here under\nmy services I've got VPN.\n\n1455\n01:15:34,750 --> 01:15:37,380\nThis is a little outside\nof the scope of the exam,\n\n1456\n01:15:37,380 --> 01:15:40,040\nthe exam doesn't cover the server piece.\n\n1457\n01:15:40,040 --> 01:15:43,470\nBut you'll see here,\nI've put my host name, my shared secret.\n\n1458\n01:15:43,470 --> 01:15:45,480\nYou use these user accounts up here.\n\n1459\n01:15:45,480 --> 01:15:48,010\nThat where the username and\npassword come from.\n\n1460\n01:15:48,010 --> 01:15:48,970\nSo you get to set up here.\n\n1461\n01:15:48,970 --> 01:15:51,590\nYou pick which protocol\nyou're going to support.\n\n1462\n01:15:51,590 --> 01:15:55,200\nL2TP or L2TP and PPTP.\n\n1463\n01:15:55,200 --> 01:15:59,800\nPPTP is less secure, so\nwe don't wanna use that unless we have to.\n\n1464\n01:15:59,800 --> 01:16:03,860\nBut it's also the most compatible so\noften times we'll need to support it.\n\n1465\n01:16:03,860 --> 01:16:07,320\nBut you can come through and specify\ninformation and then turn it on and\n\n1466\n01:16:07,320 --> 01:16:08,800\nnow you've got a VPN server.\n\n1467\n01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:10,620\nIt does need to be publicly available, so\n\n1468\n01:16:10,620 --> 01:16:12,440\nit's gotta have a public\nIP on the internet for\n\n1469\n01:16:12,440 --> 01:16:15,960\npeople outside to connect to it, but\nthat's about it for setting it up.\n\n1470\n01:16:15,960 --> 01:16:17,950\nIt's not a terribly difficult\nthing to get in place.\n\n1471\n01:16:20,612 --> 01:16:24,100\nAll right, so\nthat's the VPN side of things.\n\n1472\n01:16:24,100 --> 01:16:27,360\nAnd that will make sure that\nwe're secure while we're out and\n\n1473\n01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:29,380\nabout traveling,\non networks we don't trust.\n\n1474\n01:16:31,410 --> 01:16:33,960\nAlright, so\nlots of little bells and whistles,\n\n1475\n01:16:33,960 --> 01:16:36,840\nlots of little features we\ncan turn on inside of OS X.\n\n1476\n01:16:36,840 --> 01:16:39,990\nYou need to be familiar with each of\nthem because all of them can turn up\n\n1477\n01:16:39,990 --> 01:16:40,600\non the exam.\n\n1478\n01:16:40,600 --> 01:16:42,210\nSo we definitely want to be aware.\n\n1479\n01:16:42,210 --> 01:16:43,620\nMost of them are just automatic.\n\n1480\n01:16:43,620 --> 01:16:45,350\nRight?\nGatekeeper,\n\n1481\n01:16:45,350 --> 01:16:47,630\nantivirus protection\nthat stuff is automatic.\n\n1482\n01:16:47,630 --> 01:16:51,450\nWe don't really have to mess with it,\nbut some of them, like the firewall,\n\n1483\n01:16:51,450 --> 01:16:54,990\nlike VPN, we do need to get setup,\nall right.\n\n1484\n01:16:54,990 --> 01:16:57,900\nNow I've got one more feature we need\nto talk about in this episode and\n\n1485\n01:16:57,900 --> 01:16:59,690\nthat's a firmware password.\n\n1486\n01:16:59,690 --> 01:17:02,220\nUnfortunately, I can't do\nfirmware passwords in VMware so\n\n1487\n01:17:02,220 --> 01:17:04,950\nI'm gonna have to do it\non my actual laptop.\n\n1488\n01:17:04,950 --> 01:17:08,240\nAnd I can't share out my screen\nwhen I'm in the firmware mode.\n\n1489\n01:17:08,240 --> 01:17:11,430\nSo what we're gonna do is we're gonna\nswitch our cameras around here for\n\n1490\n01:17:11,430 --> 01:17:12,280\nthe last segment.\n\n1491\n01:17:12,280 --> 01:17:16,090\nSo that I can show you my actual laptop\nscreen and walk through that last process.\n\n1492\n01:17:16,090 --> 01:17:18,160\nSo we'll stop here and take a break.\n\n1493\n01:17:18,160 --> 01:17:21,090\nWhen we get back we're gonna\ntackle that last little bit, and\n\n1494\n01:17:21,090 --> 01:17:22,370\nthen we'll wrap up security.\n\n1495\n01:17:22,370 --> 01:17:25,014\nSo stay tuned, we'll be back in a few.\n\n1496\n01:17:25,014 --> 01:17:30,677\n[MUSIC]\n\n1497\n01:17:32,454 --> 01:17:36,220\nAll right welcome back everybody so\n[LAUGH] after a little bit.\n\n1498\n01:17:36,220 --> 01:17:40,652\nI am having a hard time not laughing\nabout this because our original plan.\n\n1499\n01:17:40,652 --> 01:17:42,620\nWe wanna do firmware passwords.\n\n1500\n01:17:42,620 --> 01:17:47,198\nAnd that means I'm gonna have to boot into\nsomething other than my main operating\n\n1501\n01:17:47,198 --> 01:17:48,820\nsystem on the laptop.\n\n1502\n01:17:48,820 --> 01:17:51,606\nSo getting a display that I can show\nyou guys is kind of challenging.\n\n1503\n01:17:51,606 --> 01:17:57,020\nI originally was gonna use an external\nmonitor, but after a series of odd events.\n\n1504\n01:17:57,020 --> 01:17:59,840\nWe kind of ended up with a solution where\n\n1505\n01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:01,710\nI have my laptop turned\nupside down beside me.\n\n1506\n01:18:01,710 --> 01:18:04,620\nSo as goofy as it is,\nthis is gonna work, trust me.\n\n1507\n01:18:04,620 --> 01:18:06,081\nI saw it on tv, all right.\n\n1508\n01:18:06,081 --> 01:18:08,320\nSo let's take a look at this.\n\n1509\n01:18:08,320 --> 01:18:11,320\nFirst off, why the heck do we even need\nto worry about firmware passwords?\n\n1510\n01:18:11,320 --> 01:18:16,270\nWell I mentioned earlier that if you\nhave user passwords on your system,\n\n1511\n01:18:16,270 --> 01:18:18,120\nand somebody boots up Mac OS.\n\n1512\n01:18:18,120 --> 01:18:20,550\nThey can't log in unless they\nhave your password, right?\n\n1513\n01:18:21,650 --> 01:18:24,610\nBut they could your hard drive out,\nstick it in another computer,\n\n1514\n01:18:24,610 --> 01:18:25,610\nand access your files.\n\n1515\n01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:30,610\nLikewise, they could boot off of a CD,\nright?\n\n1516\n01:18:30,610 --> 01:18:35,160\nThere's a lot of of Linux distributions\nthat have live CDs that are out there.\n\n1517\n01:18:35,160 --> 01:18:39,450\nThere's all sorts of hacking utilities and\nthings that you can boot right off a CD.\n\n1518\n01:18:39,450 --> 01:18:41,250\nThere's USB hard drives you can boot from.\n\n1519\n01:18:41,250 --> 01:18:43,607\nHeck, you can boot Windows off\na USB hard drive these days.\n\n1520\n01:18:43,607 --> 01:18:46,730\nSo you can boot something like that up.\n\n1521\n01:18:46,730 --> 01:18:49,470\nAnd now without even having to take your\nhard drive out they could boot off this\n\n1522\n01:18:49,470 --> 01:18:50,090\nother system.\n\n1523\n01:18:51,240 --> 01:18:55,710\nGrab your files and then just reboot\nyour computer and off they go.\n\n1524\n01:18:55,710 --> 01:18:58,830\nThe problem with this is,\nit would be next to impossible for\n\n1525\n01:18:58,830 --> 01:19:00,180\nyou to know that it happened.\n\n1526\n01:19:00,180 --> 01:19:03,730\nIt would just look like a system reboot to\nyou versus if they stole your hard drive.\n\n1527\n01:19:03,730 --> 01:19:05,600\nYou're probably gonna notice that, right.\n\n1528\n01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:08,800\nBut, if they just access the system\none time and then bolted.\n\n1529\n01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:10,520\nYou probably won't even notice.\n\n1530\n01:19:10,520 --> 01:19:11,900\nSo, that's a big problem.\n\n1531\n01:19:11,900 --> 01:19:16,560\nNow if we use, Disklog,\nI mean Disklogger, if we use,\n\n1532\n01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:21,870\nthat's a whole other product,\nif we use Biovault then they could try and\n\n1533\n01:19:21,870 --> 01:19:24,180\nreboot and\nthey won't be able to get to your stuff.\n\n1534\n01:19:24,180 --> 01:19:26,080\nBut they could format the drive, right.\n\n1535\n01:19:26,080 --> 01:19:28,770\nThey could format it and\nput their own operating system on there.\n\n1536\n01:19:28,770 --> 01:19:31,380\nSo now they can take your laptop and\nsell it on eBay or\n\n1537\n01:19:31,380 --> 01:19:33,280\nwhatever it is that they want to do.\n\n1538\n01:19:33,280 --> 01:19:37,460\nWell, with a firmware password,\nyou stop even that.\n\n1539\n01:19:37,460 --> 01:19:41,990\nWith a firmware password,\nyou make it where If that system boots up.\n\n1540\n01:19:41,990 --> 01:19:45,200\nIt will only boot from the hard\ndrive that's inside of it,\n\n1541\n01:19:45,200 --> 01:19:47,296\nfrom your main operating system, and\n\n1542\n01:19:47,296 --> 01:19:51,577\nif somebody tries to pick anything else\nThey'll have to provide a password.\n\n1543\n01:19:51,577 --> 01:19:54,986\nSo, if they were to boot from a CD, or if\nthey want to boot from a USB hard drive,\n\n1544\n01:19:54,986 --> 01:19:57,886\nor whatever, they'll have to\nprovide an alternate password, or\n\n1545\n01:19:57,886 --> 01:19:59,500\na password that you define.\n\n1546\n01:19:59,500 --> 01:20:01,940\nAnd, if they don't have that password,\nthey can't do it.\n\n1547\n01:20:01,940 --> 01:20:03,590\nThey can't choose to\nboot from another drive.\n\n1548\n01:20:03,590 --> 01:20:06,250\nThey can only boot from the hard\ndrive that is already in the system.\n\n1549\n01:20:06,250 --> 01:20:09,660\nThat hard drive, which hopefully\nyou've protected with FileVault, and\n\n1550\n01:20:09,660 --> 01:20:12,580\nyou have a proper user name and\npassword set on it.\n\n1551\n01:20:12,580 --> 01:20:13,120\nAll right?\n\n1552\n01:20:13,120 --> 01:20:14,280\nNow, if they steal your drive,\n\n1553\n01:20:14,280 --> 01:20:17,650\neven if they swap the hard drive, they\nwon't be able to install Mac OS on it.\n\n1554\n01:20:17,650 --> 01:20:19,760\nSo, they won't be able to use the machine.\n\n1555\n01:20:19,760 --> 01:20:22,363\nThey've effectively stolen a paperweight.\n\n1556\n01:20:22,363 --> 01:20:26,580\nNow, for any Mac, wait,\nit gets a little weird.\n\n1557\n01:20:26,580 --> 01:20:28,900\nWell, this whole segment's weird.\n\n1558\n01:20:28,900 --> 01:20:35,670\nFor most Macs that were manufactured after\n2010, so Macs made in the last four years,\n\n1559\n01:20:35,670 --> 01:20:39,330\nif you forget your password, or if you\nstole a laptop and it's got a firmware\n\n1560\n01:20:39,330 --> 01:20:44,120\npassword on it, the only way you can clear\nthat is to take it to an Apple store.\n\n1561\n01:20:44,120 --> 01:20:46,870\nIf you take it down to the Apple store,\nthey can clear it.\n\n1562\n01:20:46,870 --> 01:20:49,200\nNow of course, they're going to run\nthe serial number to see if it has been\n\n1563\n01:20:49,200 --> 01:20:50,090\nreported as stolen.\n\n1564\n01:20:50,090 --> 01:20:53,000\nAnd, if it's been reported as stolen,\nthey're not gonna clear it,\n\n1565\n01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,490\nand they are going to call the police,\nright?\n\n1566\n01:20:55,490 --> 01:20:59,770\nBut, if it shows that you're the one who\nowns it, that you bought the laptop.\n\n1567\n01:20:59,770 --> 01:21:02,446\nThen, they can clear the password for\nyou right there, all right?\n\n1568\n01:21:02,446 --> 01:21:07,444\nSo, on most Macs, manufactured after 2010,\nyou gotta take it to an Apple store if\n\n1569\n01:21:07,444 --> 01:21:11,696\nyou forget what the password is, so\nmake sure you remember the password.\n\n1570\n01:21:11,696 --> 01:21:14,530\nIf you remember the password, you can\nturn it on and off whenever you want.\n\n1571\n01:21:14,530 --> 01:21:17,660\nBut, if you forget the password,\nyou gotta go to the Apple store.\n\n1572\n01:21:17,660 --> 01:21:22,020\nNow, on most Macs\nmanufactured before 2010,\n\n1573\n01:21:22,020 --> 01:21:24,060\nYou could actually clear\nthe password yourself.\n\n1574\n01:21:25,220 --> 01:21:30,980\nThe way it works is the password was\nstored in firmware on the system,\n\n1575\n01:21:30,980 --> 01:21:35,180\nbut if the amount of memory in your\nsystem, the amount of RAM in your system,\n\n1576\n01:21:35,180 --> 01:21:39,020\nif that changed,\nit would trigger that password to reset.\n\n1577\n01:21:39,020 --> 01:21:43,800\nSo, on most Macs prior to 2010, what you\ncould do is you could shut them down.\n\n1578\n01:21:43,800 --> 01:21:46,210\nOpen them up, you did that to open them.\n\n1579\n01:21:46,210 --> 01:21:49,370\nAnd, if there were two memory sticks,\nor three memory sticks in there,\n\n1580\n01:21:49,370 --> 01:21:50,560\nyou just remove one.\n\n1581\n01:21:50,560 --> 01:21:53,670\nSo, take a memory stick out, and\nthen boot your system one time,\n\n1582\n01:21:53,670 --> 01:21:56,390\nand it'll boot with different memory.\n\n1583\n01:21:56,390 --> 01:21:58,310\nAnd, when it does that\nit'll clear the password.\n\n1584\n01:21:58,310 --> 01:22:02,430\nAnd then, you shut it down, and\nyou put the extra memory back in.\n\n1585\n01:22:02,430 --> 01:22:05,280\nAnd now, you're back to your original\namount of memory, and you boot up, and\n\n1586\n01:22:05,280 --> 01:22:08,440\nnow you can go in, and\nthere's no firmware password anymore.\n\n1587\n01:22:09,480 --> 01:22:11,780\nThat stopped in the middle of 2010.\n\n1588\n01:22:11,780 --> 01:22:16,030\nAnd, that's why I keep saying most Macs,\nmost Macs before or most Macs after.\n\n1589\n01:22:16,030 --> 01:22:20,460\nIn 2010, there was this division where\nsome could and some couldn't be reset.\n\n1590\n01:22:20,460 --> 01:22:24,900\nIf you've downloaded the book for this\ncertification, they've actually got a link\n\n1591\n01:22:24,900 --> 01:22:28,490\nto the Apple site that gives\nthe specific list of all the devices.\n\n1592\n01:22:28,490 --> 01:22:31,330\nI know mine is a 2013 model, so\n\n1593\n01:22:31,330 --> 01:22:36,450\nit has to be taken to the store\nif I forget my password.\n\n1594\n01:22:36,450 --> 01:22:37,060\nAll right so, enough of that.\n\n1595\n01:22:37,060 --> 01:22:40,110\nLet's take a look at\nwhat this password is.\n\n1596\n01:22:40,110 --> 01:22:44,560\nNormally, when you boot up your laptop,\nIt's gonna boot to your hard drive,\n\n1597\n01:22:44,560 --> 01:22:48,070\nto your Macintosh HD where you've got\nMac OS installed, and it's gonna boot and\n\n1598\n01:22:48,070 --> 01:22:48,790\ntake you there, so right?\n\n1599\n01:22:48,790 --> 01:22:50,710\nThat's what happens normally.\n\n1600\n01:22:50,710 --> 01:22:53,960\nIf we want to boot to something\nelse though, there's a few options.\n\n1601\n01:22:55,130 --> 01:22:58,110\nFor example, if you want to boot to\nRecovery, when you boot your system up,\n\n1602\n01:22:58,110 --> 01:23:02,970\nyou can hold Cmd+R, and\nCmd+R will cause it to boot to Recovery.\n\n1603\n01:23:02,970 --> 01:23:04,050\nOr, what I normally do,\n\n1604\n01:23:04,050 --> 01:23:08,430\ncuz I forget Cmd+R, is when I boot,\nif you hold the Alt key.\n\n1605\n01:23:08,430 --> 01:23:13,440\nSo, if you hit the Alt/Option key,\nif you hold that Option key, when your\n\n1606\n01:23:13,440 --> 01:23:18,530\nsystem boots up, you get a menu that will\nask you which device you wanna boot from.\n\n1607\n01:23:18,530 --> 01:23:20,340\nAnd usually,\nyou'll see at least two things,\n\n1608\n01:23:20,340 --> 01:23:25,440\nyour hard drive, your Macintosh HD, and\nyour recovery partition, if you have one.\n\n1609\n01:23:25,440 --> 01:23:29,459\nBut, you might also see your CD drive,\nThunderbolt drives, USB drives, other\n\n1610\n01:23:29,459 --> 01:23:33,613\ndrives that you might have attached that\nhave bootable operating systems on them.\n\n1611\n01:23:33,613 --> 01:23:36,670\nThen, you can pick from any of them and\nboot up.\n\n1612\n01:23:36,670 --> 01:23:40,180\nBut, that's what the attackers can\nuse to try and bypass your security.\n\n1613\n01:23:40,180 --> 01:23:43,770\nAnd, that's what we're trying to prevent\nwith a firmware password, all right?\n\n1614\n01:23:43,770 --> 01:23:46,490\nSo, let me show you turning a firmware\npassword on on my laptop, and\n\n1615\n01:23:46,490 --> 01:23:48,352\nwe'll get a chance to see\nwhat this process is like.\n\n1616\n01:23:48,352 --> 01:23:51,100\nAll right, so here's my laptop.\n\n1617\n01:23:51,100 --> 01:23:55,860\nI apologize, normally we'd do a digital\nduplicate of my screen, so it's nice and\n\n1618\n01:23:55,860 --> 01:23:56,613\nsharp here.\n\n1619\n01:23:56,613 --> 01:23:59,051\nI literally have a camera\npointed at the screen, so\n\n1620\n01:23:59,051 --> 01:24:02,250\nit's going to look a little\nbit less sharp than normal.\n\n1621\n01:24:02,250 --> 01:24:05,942\nBut, here's my laptop,\nit's booted up, I got stuff on it,\n\n1622\n01:24:05,942 --> 01:24:09,280\nso there it is, and\nI'm going to go ahead and reboot it.\n\n1623\n01:24:09,280 --> 01:24:10,570\nSo, I'm just gonna hit Restart.\n\n1624\n01:24:11,890 --> 01:24:17,120\nAnd, when it restarts, I'm gonna hold\ndown the Alt key on the keyboard,\n\n1625\n01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:20,380\nthat Option/Alt key, so\nI'm just reaching over here.\n\n1626\n01:24:20,380 --> 01:24:21,620\nI'm very low tech.\n\n1627\n01:24:21,620 --> 01:24:23,495\nI have a Bluetooth\nkeyboard in front of me,\n\n1628\n01:24:23,495 --> 01:24:27,795\nbut Bluetooth won't work at that\nstage in the boot process, right?\n\n1629\n01:24:27,795 --> 01:24:30,425\nWe're talking about a firmware operation.\n\n1630\n01:24:30,425 --> 01:24:32,895\nSo, when you boot up,\nyour operating system is not running.\n\n1631\n01:24:32,895 --> 01:24:34,875\nYou're not really going to be\npaired with Bluetooth, and\n\n1632\n01:24:34,875 --> 01:24:36,654\nall those other good things.\n\n1633\n01:24:36,654 --> 01:24:37,622\nAll right, so\n\n1634\n01:24:37,622 --> 01:24:41,252\nI'm gonna let this reboot and\nI'm just holding that Alt key over here.\n\n1635\n01:24:41,252 --> 01:24:44,572\nI'm actually holding it early,\nI haven't actually rebooted yet.\n\n1636\n01:24:44,572 --> 01:24:48,740\nSo, if I had a little more patience\nI could wait, there it goes.\n\n1637\n01:24:48,740 --> 01:24:50,960\nNow, I'm just going to hold\ndown that Option button.\n\n1638\n01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:54,510\nIt's booting up.\n\n1639\n01:24:54,510 --> 01:24:57,390\nNormally, it would just go and\nboot off the first hard drive it finds,\n\n1640\n01:24:57,390 --> 01:24:59,750\nbut now I get a list.\n\n1641\n01:24:59,750 --> 01:25:03,590\nI can see right here on the screen\nthat I get my hard drive and\n\n1642\n01:25:03,590 --> 01:25:07,600\nmy recovery partition and\nI can pick between them.\n\n1643\n01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:09,200\nI just pick which one I wanna boot.\n\n1644\n01:25:09,200 --> 01:25:14,850\nThis is the same system that attackers can\nuse to bypass your security, all right?\n\n1645\n01:25:14,850 --> 01:25:19,870\nNow, to set a firmware password,\nyou cannot boot to your operating system.\n\n1646\n01:25:19,870 --> 01:25:22,740\nYou've got to boot to Recovery,\nor boot off of,\n\n1647\n01:25:22,740 --> 01:25:26,400\nlike if you made a USB Mavericks\ninstaller, you can boot off of that.\n\n1648\n01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:29,930\nI normally boot right off of Recovery, so\nI'm gonna go into my Recovery partition.\n\n1649\n01:25:32,330 --> 01:25:33,430\nAnd so, we'll let that boot up.\n\n1650\n01:25:34,710 --> 01:25:37,660\nOnce we're in the Recovery partition,\nit's gonna ask to do things like\n\n1651\n01:25:37,660 --> 01:25:42,450\nrestore from Time Machine, or reinstall\nMac OS, and that's not what we want.\n\n1652\n01:25:42,450 --> 01:25:45,080\nUp in our menu bar, though,\nwe'll have some utilities.\n\n1653\n01:25:45,080 --> 01:25:48,190\nAnd one of the utilities is to\ninstall a firmware password.\n\n1654\n01:25:48,190 --> 01:25:49,449\nAnd, that's the one that\nI'm going to choose.\n\n1655\n01:25:50,900 --> 01:25:51,955\nI'll go ahead and use English,\n\n1656\n01:25:51,955 --> 01:25:54,670\ncuz I at least have a basic\nmastery of that language.\n\n1657\n01:25:54,670 --> 01:25:58,366\nAnd so, I'm going to go here,\nhere's the reinstall OS x and\n\n1658\n01:25:58,366 --> 01:26:00,405\nso on, I don't want that stuff.\n\n1659\n01:26:00,405 --> 01:26:02,986\nBut, up top if I go to utilities,\n\n1660\n01:26:02,986 --> 01:26:07,238\nright there I've got\nthe firmware password utility.\n\n1661\n01:26:07,238 --> 01:26:10,881\nNow, when we choose it it gives us\na little message here that is kind\n\n1662\n01:26:10,881 --> 01:26:15,060\nof washing out, let me see if I can get\nthat to show up better, well, shoot.\n\n1663\n01:26:16,170 --> 01:26:17,680\nYeah, it's kind of washed out.\n\n1664\n01:26:17,680 --> 01:26:21,740\nWell, what it is is just a simple\nmessage here that's telling me,\n\n1665\n01:26:21,740 --> 01:26:25,340\nit says password protection is off,\nturn on a password, blah,\n\n1666\n01:26:25,340 --> 01:26:27,560\nblah, blah, and\nthere's just one button right here.\n\n1667\n01:26:27,560 --> 01:26:28,740\nOh, thanks Jason.\n\n1668\n01:26:28,740 --> 01:26:29,530\nSo, there we go.\n\n1669\n01:26:29,530 --> 01:26:33,380\nSo, we can kind of see that button right\nthere that says turn on firmware password.\n\n1670\n01:26:33,380 --> 01:26:35,530\nSo, I'm going to hit that button, and\n\n1671\n01:26:35,530 --> 01:26:38,500\nnow it's going to ask me what\nI want the password to be.\n\n1672\n01:26:38,500 --> 01:26:42,630\nSo, I can just punch in my desired\npassword, and it does make\n\n1673\n01:26:42,630 --> 01:26:47,160\nyou type it twice, which is kind of\nconvenient, because I'm a horrible typer.\n\n1674\n01:26:47,160 --> 01:26:49,113\nAnd, if you get it wrong and can't log in,\n\n1675\n01:26:49,113 --> 01:26:51,405\nthen you've got to make\na trip to the Apple store.\n\n1676\n01:26:51,405 --> 01:26:55,620\nAnd, if you're like me, the nearest Apple\nstore, it's an hour and a half away.\n\n1677\n01:26:55,620 --> 01:26:57,530\nI think there might be a service\ncenter here in town, but\n\n1678\n01:26:57,530 --> 01:26:59,530\nthere's no Apple store here.\n\n1679\n01:26:59,530 --> 01:27:02,630\nAnd, a lot of Apple authorized\nservice centers are able to reset\n\n1680\n01:27:02,630 --> 01:27:03,700\nthe password, too.\n\n1681\n01:27:03,700 --> 01:27:05,462\nSo, you can go to them sometimes.\n\n1682\n01:27:05,462 --> 01:27:08,300\nAll right, I'm gonna go ahead and\nset that password.\n\n1683\n01:27:09,750 --> 01:27:10,720\nAll right.\nNow, that it's set,\n\n1684\n01:27:10,720 --> 01:27:13,540\nI can see that password\nprotection is enabled.\n\n1685\n01:27:13,540 --> 01:27:14,180\nAll right?\n\n1686\n01:27:14,180 --> 01:27:15,730\nWell, how do I test it out?\n\n1687\n01:27:15,730 --> 01:27:19,830\nWell, to test it out,\nyou can simply restart, and try and\n\n1688\n01:27:19,830 --> 01:27:20,960\nboot from an alternate drive.\n\n1689\n01:27:20,960 --> 01:27:22,060\nSo, that's what I'm going to do.\n\n1690\n01:27:22,060 --> 01:27:25,140\nI'm going to go in here and\njust tell it to restart, and\n\n1691\n01:27:25,140 --> 01:27:28,680\nI'm going to hold that Alt key\njust like I did a moment ago.\n\n1692\n01:27:28,680 --> 01:27:31,320\nAnd, when I hold that Alt key,\nI'm telling it, hey,\n\n1693\n01:27:31,320 --> 01:27:33,110\nI want to boot from something else.\n\n1694\n01:27:33,110 --> 01:27:35,060\nAnd, there we go.\n\n1695\n01:27:35,060 --> 01:27:37,360\nIt's not letting me pick something else.\n\n1696\n01:27:37,360 --> 01:27:43,693\nI have to provide my firmware password if\nI want to pick something else, all right?\n\n1697\n01:27:43,693 --> 01:27:46,978\nAnd, I can punch that in.\n\n1698\n01:27:46,978 --> 01:27:51,692\nAnd now,\nI can pick from the hard drives All right.\n\n1699\n01:27:51,692 --> 01:27:55,559\nNow, I'm gonna move back\ninto recovery real quick.\n\n1700\n01:27:55,559 --> 01:27:59,215\nAll right, now, I had to punch\nin my password there because\n\n1701\n01:27:59,215 --> 01:28:02,740\nI was booting from an alternate\nboot source, all right?\n\n1702\n01:28:02,740 --> 01:28:03,791\nWhat if I didn't?\n\n1703\n01:28:03,791 --> 01:28:05,358\nWhat if I just wanted to\nboot from a hard drive?\n\n1704\n01:28:05,358 --> 01:28:10,120\nI don't wanna have to enter in a firmware\npassword every time I turn on my laptop.\n\n1705\n01:28:10,120 --> 01:28:12,460\nWell, fortunately, you don't.\n\n1706\n01:28:12,460 --> 01:28:16,620\nSo, if I go back forward here,\nlet me restart this machine.\n\n1707\n01:28:16,620 --> 01:28:19,450\nI'm not gonna hold the Alt key this time.\n\n1708\n01:28:19,450 --> 01:28:23,170\nI'm just gonna let it boot up,\nand go right in.\n\n1709\n01:28:23,170 --> 01:28:25,060\nAnd what we're gonna see is it boots.\n\n1710\n01:28:25,060 --> 01:28:29,070\nI see my Apple logo, and\nthen it's gonna boot to my hard drive.\n\n1711\n01:28:29,070 --> 01:28:30,570\nIt only asks for\n\n1712\n01:28:30,570 --> 01:28:34,330\nthe firmware password if you're trying\nto boot from an alternate location.\n\n1713\n01:28:35,550 --> 01:28:38,830\nSo, if you're booting from\nyour regular disk like normal,\n\n1714\n01:28:38,830 --> 01:28:40,376\nyou never even see that firmware password.\n\n1715\n01:28:40,376 --> 01:28:41,985\nSo, it's no inconvenience.\n\n1716\n01:28:41,985 --> 01:28:45,695\nYou might as well go ahead and set it,\nas long as you don't forget it.\n\n1717\n01:28:45,695 --> 01:28:47,465\nRight?\nThis is not like the rotisserie chicken.\n\n1718\n01:28:47,465 --> 01:28:49,985\nWe do not want to set it and forget it.\n\n1719\n01:28:49,985 --> 01:28:54,125\nSo, as long as we've got that, we can\nget logged in and access our system.\n\n1720\n01:28:54,125 --> 01:28:56,750\nAnd so, I'll just come in here and\nlog in as me.\n\n1721\n01:28:56,750 --> 01:29:00,591\nI will come in here and\nattempt to log in as me.\n\n1722\n01:29:00,591 --> 01:29:04,980\nMy keyboard is upside down over here,\nso I can't use it.\n\n1723\n01:29:04,980 --> 01:29:09,007\nSo, I'm using a bluetooth keyboard and\nmouse, which have a little bit of lag.\n\n1724\n01:29:09,007 --> 01:29:10,086\nThere we go.\n\n1725\n01:29:10,086 --> 01:29:13,825\nAll right, so, I can work like normal\nwithout having to do anything special.\n\n1726\n01:29:13,825 --> 01:29:18,305\nAnd if I wanna turn that\nfirmware password off,\n\n1727\n01:29:18,305 --> 01:29:23,580\nall I need to do is restart and\ngo back into recovery.\n\n1728\n01:29:23,580 --> 01:29:28,030\nAnd in recovery,\nI can turn that password off.\n\n1729\n01:29:29,640 --> 01:29:30,298\nSo, I'll go and let this restart.\n\n1730\n01:29:33,039 --> 01:29:37,834\nSo, each of these three pieces makes\nup a part of our secure system.\n\n1731\n01:29:37,834 --> 01:29:46,880\nIf you combine a strong user password\nwith file vault and a firmware password.\n\n1732\n01:29:46,880 --> 01:29:51,049\nIf you have all three of those things and\nsomebody steals your laptop or desktop,\n\n1733\n01:29:51,049 --> 01:29:52,409\nit's worthless to them.\n\n1734\n01:29:52,409 --> 01:29:55,752\nThey can't use it, they can't get\nat the data, it's a paperweight.\n\n1735\n01:29:55,752 --> 01:29:58,299\nAll right, so,\nthose are the three pieces that you\n\n1736\n01:29:58,299 --> 01:30:01,805\nneed to have in place to have true and\ntotal security over that system.\n\n1737\n01:30:01,805 --> 01:30:06,378\niCloud, the Find My iPhone, that kind of\nfeature to be able to locate and remote\n\n1738\n01:30:06,378 --> 01:30:11,228\nwipe systems, that's great, but if the\nsystem never comes back up on the network,\n\n1739\n01:30:11,228 --> 01:30:15,250\nthen you're not going to\nbe able to remote-wipe it.\n\n1740\n01:30:15,250 --> 01:30:16,490\nSo, those are somewhat limited.\n\n1741\n01:30:16,490 --> 01:30:20,240\nYou can't trust them to protect your data.\n\n1742\n01:30:20,240 --> 01:30:22,740\nYou've got to go that extra step\non your own to protect the data,\n\n1743\n01:30:22,740 --> 01:30:23,900\nand this is the way to do it.\n\n1744\n01:30:23,900 --> 01:30:26,750\nSo, just to recap, set a password for\n\n1745\n01:30:26,750 --> 01:30:30,730\nyour user account, use FileVault\nto encrypt your hard drive, and\n\n1746\n01:30:30,730 --> 01:30:35,930\nset a firmware password to stop people\nfrom bypassing your encrypted hard drive.\n\n1747\n01:30:38,140 --> 01:30:42,540\nSo, those are the secrets to getting in\nand making sure that our system is secure.\n\n1748\n01:30:42,540 --> 01:30:43,440\nAnd I'm just gonna go in here and\n\n1749\n01:30:43,440 --> 01:30:46,170\nturn that firmware password off,\nand then we'll be back in business.\n\n1750\n01:30:47,760 --> 01:30:51,710\nAll right.\nSo, there are obviously a lot of security\n\n1751\n01:30:51,710 --> 01:30:55,320\nissues out there, and things we need to\nbe aware of, but for the Mac integration\n\n1752\n01:30:55,320 --> 01:30:59,780\nbasic show and for the exam, those are the\nones that we need to be familiar with.\n\n1753\n01:30:59,780 --> 01:31:01,420\nSo, quite a bit of stuff there.\n\n1754\n01:31:01,420 --> 01:31:02,820\nMake sure you're up on it.\n\n1755\n01:31:02,820 --> 01:31:05,860\nSome of the stuff we don't use a whole\nlot, so make sure you study and\n\n1756\n01:31:05,860 --> 01:31:09,820\nget some practice with it,\nbut that's basically it.\n\n1757\n01:31:09,820 --> 01:31:13,350\nHere, as soon as my\nmagic pad wakes back up.\n\n1758\n01:31:13,350 --> 01:31:16,640\nThere we go.\nI'll go in here and turn my password off.\n\n1759\n01:31:16,640 --> 01:31:20,170\nTurning the password off, we just go right\nback into that firmware password utility,\n\n1760\n01:31:21,640 --> 01:31:25,125\nand you can change the password or\nyou can turn it off.\n\n1761\n01:31:25,125 --> 01:31:27,225\nSorry, it was legible for a second there.\n\n1762\n01:31:27,225 --> 01:31:28,165\nSo, I'm just gonna turn it off.\n\n1763\n01:31:28,165 --> 01:31:30,585\nAnd when you turn it off, it just\nprompts you for the password again.\n\n1764\n01:31:30,585 --> 01:31:33,615\nSo, I'll punch that in, and there we go.\n\n1765\n01:31:33,615 --> 01:31:36,415\nSo, now it's disabled, and\nI can reboot without it.\n\n1766\n01:31:36,415 --> 01:31:39,795\nSorry, the studio lights were hitting\nthat and kind of washing it out a bit.\n\n1767\n01:31:39,795 --> 01:31:41,696\nThat's why we normally do\nthe digital screen share,\n\n1768\n01:31:41,696 --> 01:31:42,888\nit makes things look a lot nicer.\n\n1769\n01:31:44,565 --> 01:31:46,420\nAll right.\nSo, there we go.\n\n1770\n01:31:46,420 --> 01:31:48,910\nSo, that pretty much wraps this one up.\n\n1771\n01:31:48,910 --> 01:31:49,880\nLet me just remind everybody.\n\n1772\n01:31:49,880 --> 01:31:52,605\nIf you have questions on any\nof the different

00:00:38,850\nWelcome back to another\nepisode of IT Pro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:41,606\nI'm your host Don Pezet today with Mr.\n\n5\n00:00:41,606 --> 00:00:46,045\nHP LaserJet 5200,\nhow's it going HP LaserJet 5200?\n\n6\n00:00:46,045 --> 00:00:48,120\nAll right,\nwell that's not gonna work out so well.\n\n7\n00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,942\nSo I have a electronic co\nhost today who's not talking.\n\n8\n00:00:51,942 --> 00:00:55,380\n[LAUGH] So we are going to\nbe tackling printers today,\n\n9\n00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:58,280\ncause you gotta do it sooner or later.\n\n10\n00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:02,430\nPrinters are one of those things that,\neverybody's got one,\n\n11\n00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:04,470\nand hopefully you don't use it anymore.\n\n12\n00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:08,470\nMost people have gone all digital or\nelectronic documentation, but\n\n13\n00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:09,390\nnot everybody, and\n\n14\n00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:13,590\nthere's a lot of organizations\nbusiness models that rely on paper.\n\n15\n00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:17,740\nFor example, if you are a retailer of any\nsort, you've got to give receipts, and\n\n16\n00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:20,280\nthose receipts almost\nalways have to be on paper.\n\n17\n00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,530\nSo printers are still a very\ncommon thing out there, and\n\n18\n00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:26,150\nwe need to be able to\nuse them on our Macs.\n\n19\n00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:31,050\nFortunately the Apple support for printers\nis a second to none, it is really good.\n\n20\n00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:33,320\nSo we have a lot of excellent support.\n\n21\n00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,760\nMost printers work without even driver,\n\n22\n00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,525\nyou just stick it on the thing and\nit will work.\n\n23\n00:01:36,525 --> 00:01:39,140\n[COUGH] And you're in business.\n\n24\n00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:41,030\nBut sometimes it takes\na little more than that.\n\n25\n00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:43,185\nSo that's what we're gonna\nlook at in this episode.\n\n26\n00:01:43,185 --> 00:01:45,600\nIf we take a look at adding\nprinters to our system.\n\n27\n00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,642\nAnd the different types of\nprinters that Mac OS supports.\n\n28\n00:01:49,642 --> 00:01:52,840\nAll right, well the first one that\nwe're gonna tackle is a USB printer.\n\n29\n00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:57,070\nWhen you buy a printer these days, most\nof them have one of two connectivities.\n\n30\n00:01:57,070 --> 00:02:00,150\nThey either connect via your network or\nvia USB.\n\n31\n00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:02,600\nIn the old days, we had the LPT ports,\n\n32\n00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:06,430\nthe line printer ports that were\nthose gigantic syntronics connectors.\n\n33\n00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:07,890\nWe don't really see those anymore.\n\n34\n00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:09,700\nHopefully you don't see those anymore.\n\n35\n00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:12,000\nSo it really just is USB, which is,\n\n36\n00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,520\nyou know a physical cable that we plug in,\nor a network, and\n\n37\n00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:19,050\nthe network might be a physical\nnetwork jack or it might be wireless.\n\n38\n00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:22,920\nThese days a lot of printers\nsupport wireless connectivity.\n\n39\n00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,000\nAnd that way things like your iPad, and\n\n40\n00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,030\nyour iPhone that don't have network\njacks can see the printer and\n\n41\n00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:30,680\nconnect up and print to it without\nhaving to physically connect.\n\n42\n00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:37,104\nSo, if we have network enabled printers,\nwhy would I want a USB printer, right?\n\n43\n00:02:37,104 --> 00:02:40,640\nWell they specifically call out, and\nthis is in Apple's recommendation, so\n\n44\n00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:45,480\nit's important to know, is that if your\nprinter has a scanner built into it, and\n\n45\n00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,670\nyou scan sensitive documents,\n\n46\n00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:50,380\nyou may not want those sensitive\ndocuments to go over your network.\n\n47\n00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:52,270\nEspecially if it's a wireless network.\n\n48\n00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:56,610\nBut if it's a network printer and you\nleave a document on the flatbed scanner,\n\n49\n00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:00,440\nsomeone else can connect to it and pull\na scan and get that document from you.\n\n50\n00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,990\nSo, scanning printers are not very secure.\n\n51\n00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:04,230\nThey just, they aren't.\n\n52\n00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:08,380\nSo if you're gonna be using a scanner,\nyou'll want to have it USB connected.\n\n53\n00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:11,660\nOr maybe you're like me and\nyou're a tightwad.\n\n54\n00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:14,300\nAnd you refuse to buy a new printer\njust to get wireless, and so\n\n55\n00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,490\nyou still have USB, right?\n\n56\n00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:17,350\nSo there are plenty of reasons.\n\n57\n00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:21,760\nWell, USB support in\nMac OS is pretty good.\n\n58\n00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,960\nNew printers come out all the time,\nthough.\n\n59\n00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:27,260\nSo, your version of Mac OS that\nyou're running on your system\n\n60\n00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:29,320\nmight not have the drivers for\nyour printer.\n\n61\n00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:33,460\nSo, before we even plug the printer in,\nwe need to do one of two things.\n\n62\n00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:35,280\nOne, you can go to the vendor and\n\n63\n00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,170\ndownload the updated driver from\ntheir site in a lot of cases.\n\n64\n00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:40,240\nBut that's not what you're\ngonna see on the exam.\n\n65\n00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:44,120\nOn the exam, what we're gonna see it,\ndo your updates.\n\n66\n00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,560\nMake sure that Mac OS is up to date,\nright?\n\n67\n00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,810\nWhen you do system updates,\nyou're not just getting security fixes and\n\n68\n00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:54,130\napplication updates, you're also\ngetting driver updates, support for\n\n69\n00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:57,700\nnew hardware, and that's not just\nprinters, it's other devices, too.\n\n70\n00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:01,303\nSo any time you're about to add\na new hardware to your system,\n\n71\n00:04:01,303 --> 00:04:03,250\nupdate Mac OS first, right?\n\n72\n00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:05,320\nAnd I don't mean update to\nthe entire new version.\n\n73\n00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,540\nYou can just go into the App Store and\ndo your updates.\n\n74\n00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:08,230\nWhatever's available.\n\n75\n00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:10,520\nI've got updates for\nthis machine right now I need to do.\n\n76\n00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:13,570\nBut when you do those updates it ensures\nthat you've got the latest drivers, and\n\n77\n00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:17,570\nyou'll get the best compatibility and\ndetection rate possible, all right?\n\n78\n00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:22,130\nSo once you've done your update,\nstep two, USB printer, plug it in.\n\n79\n00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:23,710\nUsually that's all it takes.\n\n80\n00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:24,550\nI'm gonna take this one and\n\n81\n00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:28,780\nplug it into my system,\nwhich apparently I can't seem to achieve.\n\n82\n00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:29,820\nThere we go.\n\n83\n00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:32,830\nAnd I'm on a virtual machine so I have\nto tell it to actually connect to that\n\n84\n00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:35,760\nclient, so\nI'm gonna have it connect to my client.\n\n85\n00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:38,770\nAnd when you plug it in,\nyou might not see anything happen for\n\n86\n00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:41,920\na moment but it is actually detecting\nthat the printer is there, and\n\n87\n00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,990\nyou should get this box right here.\n\n88\n00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:47,040\nYour system might already\nhave the software for it.\n\n89\n00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:47,640\nMine doesn't.\n\n90\n00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:50,160\nSo it's saying hey,\nI just picked up an HP LaserJet 5200.\n\n91\n00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,380\nDo you wanna download and\ninstall the software?\n\n92\n00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:54,830\nAnd I'll go ahead and hit install.\n\n93\n00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:57,940\nSo it's gonna reach out\nto get that software.\n\n94\n00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:00,550\nSo there it is, it's going out and\nit's pulling it from Apple.\n\n95\n00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:04,210\nIt's 115 megabytes in size,\nso that's pretty big.\n\n96\n00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:06,760\nSo this is where one of those\ncaching servers, or whatever,\n\n97\n00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:10,160\ncan really help if you got a ton of\ncomputers that are gonna need this driver.\n\n98\n00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,570\nYou can save some bandwidth.\n\n99\n00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:14,050\nBut I'll let that download and\nget on the system.\n\n100\n00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:18,120\nOnce I've got it, my system will\nknow how to talk to this printer.\n\n101\n00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,980\nSo USB printers, really,\n\n102\n00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:22,420\nthey're the easiest of the ones\nthat we set up on our systems.\n\n103\n00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:25,645\nUsually you just plug it in and if you\nneed a driver you hit install, right?\n\n104\n00:05:25,645 --> 00:05:29,095\nIf it's already got the driver then\nit would have added it already and\n\n105\n00:05:29,095 --> 00:05:31,935\njust told me that the printer\nwas ready and I could go ahead.\n\n106\n00:05:31,935 --> 00:05:34,985\nOkay, so pretty straight\nforward process there for USB.\n\n107\n00:05:34,985 --> 00:05:38,555\nNow that's not the only way\nthat a printer can connect.\n\n108\n00:05:38,555 --> 00:05:39,605\nI mentioned networks.\n\n109\n00:05:39,605 --> 00:05:42,255\nSo I might have a network\nattached printer.\n\n110\n00:05:42,255 --> 00:05:45,950\nSince it's network attached, my computer\nis not gonna give me a dialogue box\n\n111\n00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:47,600\nsaying, hey we just found this printer.\n\n112\n00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,630\nIt's gonna be up to me,\nto tell it yeah I want to add that one.\n\n113\n00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:54,430\nCause you might have 10, 20 or\n50 printers on the network.\n\n114\n00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:57,370\nYou don't wanna add all 50,\nso you might want to pick and\n\n115\n00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:00,222\nchoose that's why it doesn't\nautomatically add them.\n\n116\n00:06:00,222 --> 00:06:01,370\nAll right, there it goes,\n\n117\n00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:04,120\njust installing that driver now\nthat it finished downloading.\n\n118\n00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,610\nYou know, it said two minutes but\nthe install is normally faster.\n\n119\n00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:08,020\nSo it'll churn through and\n\n120\n00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:11,130\nfinish that up, then we can see\nabout adding some other printers.\n\n121\n00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:13,820\nNow, this printer that I'm using\nhere is not a new printer.\n\n122\n00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,100\nIt's been out for several years.\n\n123\n00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:17,010\nIt's an HP LaserJet 5200.\n\n124\n00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:18,560\nIt's pretty widely supported.\n\n125\n00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,460\nIt doesn't have too many bells and\nwhistles, but\n\n126\n00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:22,900\nit does have things like\nmultiple paper trays.\n\n127\n00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:25,350\nAnd so Mac OS has to detect that.\n\n128\n00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:28,510\nIt's gonna look at the printer,\nand it's gonna figure out\n\n129\n00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:31,670\nthe options that pertain to tha printer\nand make sure they're set up right.\n\n130\n00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:35,170\nWe'll unfortunately,\nit's not always right.\n\n131\n00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:38,540\nSometimes printers don't report\nback all of the information about\n\n132\n00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:39,720\nthe device itself.\n\n133\n00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,960\nAnd so we might have to get a little\nmore involved to let this printer know\n\n134\n00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,420\nthat we're ready to use it, all right.\n\n135\n00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:49,620\nSo my dialogue just disappeared, so\nthat means the printer is ready to go.\n\n136\n00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:50,950\nWell how do I know that?\n\n137\n00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:54,546\nWell I can go into my system preferences.\n\n138\n00:06:54,546 --> 00:06:58,010\nAnd in my system preferences,\nI can go to Printers and Scanners, and\n\n139\n00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:01,536\nI should see an HP LaserJet 5200,\nand hopefully it's got a little\n\n140\n00:07:01,536 --> 00:07:05,680\ngreen circle on there letting me\nknow that I can communicate with it.\n\n141\n00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,290\nAll right.\n\n142\n00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:09,590\nNow, if it picked up my printer 100%,\neverything's configured right,\n\n143\n00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:11,500\nI don't need to mess with it anymore.\n\n144\n00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:15,170\nBut if there's features on this printer\nthat it didn't automatically detect,\n\n145\n00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:17,545\nI might need to come in and\ntweak it a little bit.\n\n146\n00:07:17,545 --> 00:07:20,530\nUntil you'll see options and\nsupplies right here.\n\n147\n00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:22,340\nWhen you go into options and supplies,\n\n148\n00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:26,750\nhere's where you can tell it additional\nhardware that your printer might have.\n\n149\n00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:30,502\nSo, if I go to my options tab,\nI can see tray number three.\n\n150\n00:07:30,502 --> 00:07:31,010\nAll right.\n\n151\n00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:35,490\nIf I look at this thing, looking at\nthe front of it I see tray number one,\n\n152\n00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:37,340\ntray number two, tray number three.\n\n153\n00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:40,520\nSo I've got three trays and\ntray number three,\n\n154\n00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:43,550\nit's saying it's a 500 sheet input tray.\n\n155\n00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:44,130\nSo I need to look.\n\n156\n00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,530\nIs that a 500 sheet input tray?\n\n157\n00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:47,990\nLooks like it to me, right?\n\n158\n00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:48,760\nBut maybe it's not.\n\n159\n00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,220\nMaybe it's not even installed.\n\n160\n00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,170\nAnd so I could choose that\nnot installed option and\n\n161\n00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:54,160\nit'll never use tray number three.\n\n162\n00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,468\nOr here, collation in printer.\n\n163\n00:07:56,468 --> 00:08:00,208\nDo we have enough memory in\nthe printer to do collation or no?\n\n164\n00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:03,647\nWell, it wasn't able to figure that out\nand so, well maybe it did figure it out,\n\n165\n00:08:03,647 --> 00:08:04,467\ncause it said yes.\n\n166\n00:08:04,467 --> 00:08:07,067\nBut we may need to override that.\n\n167\n00:08:07,067 --> 00:08:08,809\nWhether it's got a duplex unit.\n\n168\n00:08:08,809 --> 00:08:10,631\nNow, I'm looking at\nthe back of this one and\n\n169\n00:08:10,631 --> 00:08:12,460\nI'm pretty sure I don't see a duplex unit.\n\n170\n00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:13,980\nLet me just peak off camera here.\n\n171\n00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:16,930\nNo. Yep. So this one does not have\na duplex unit, so that's not checked,\n\n172\n00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:17,790\nthat's a good thing.\n\n173\n00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:21,790\nBut if there was one I could check it here\nand now it'll try to use the duplexer.\n\n174\n00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:24,510\nAnd remember a duplexer just\nmeans that we can print to both\n\n175\n00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:28,180\nsides of a piece of paper instead\nof just one side, all right.\n\n176\n00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,860\nIt's also got options for\ntelling it whether or\n\n177\n00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:33,710\nnot it's got a hard drive in it and\nwhether or not we can fit to a page.\n\n178\n00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:36,000\nSo those are all things\nwe might need to tweak,\n\n179\n00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,980\nif they weren't automatically detected.\n\n180\n00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:42,190\nWell, this is an HP printer,\nif you get an HP, or a Canon, or\n\n181\n00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:44,790\na Lexmark, they're pretty much\ngoing to automatically detect.\n\n182\n00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:47,560\nThose companies are really\ngood about that stuff.\n\n183\n00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,900\nIt's when you start going\nwith the weird off brands,\n\n184\n00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:54,500\nthe things like the Apollos and\nprinters like that, then it's hit or\n\n185\n00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,780\nmiss whether or\nnot the features are gonna get picked up.\n\n186\n00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:59,700\nSo you may or\nmay not have to come in here.\n\n187\n00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:01,960\nAll right.\n\n188\n00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:02,730\nSo I'm good there.\n\n189\n00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:05,210\nThere's my printer and I'm ready to rock.\n\n190\n00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:08,360\nNow how do we know if\nit's actually working?\n\n191\n00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,530\nWell we can test it.\n\n192\n00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:11,850\nYou've got this open\nprint queue button and\n\n193\n00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:15,850\nthat will show you anything that's\nwaiting to be printed on that printer.\n\n194\n00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:17,750\nI can see right now I've got nothing.\n\n195\n00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,520\nAnd if I go into my settings,\nthat should look familiar.\n\n196\n00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,930\nThat's the same as\nthe other settings screen.\n\n197\n00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:22,600\nAll right.\n\n198\n00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,230\nBut here I can see anything\nthat's waiting to be printed.\n\n199\n00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:29,170\nAnd I can send a print job to it, and\nI should see it up here, right here.\n\n200\n00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:31,550\nSo let me try and print something.\n\n201\n00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:37,480\nHere, I'll just fire up a note, all right.\n\n202\n00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,750\nThis is a test note.\n\n203\n00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:40,342\nAll right.\n\n204\n00:09:40,342 --> 00:09:43,890\nAnd I'll go in here and I will print it.\n\n205\n00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:46,060\nAnd I will print it to\nthat HP LaserJet 5200.\n\n206\n00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:49,680\nAnd keep an eye over here in my print\nqueue because it'll only show up briefly.\n\n207\n00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,240\nIt's a very small print job, and I don't\nexpect it to be in there very long.\n\n208\n00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:53,960\nThere it is.\n\n209\n00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,680\nThis is a test note.\n\n210\n00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,730\nIt's sending it to the printer,\nand the printer,\n\n211\n00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:00,720\nI can hear it starting to wind up.\n\n212\n00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,240\nI don't know if you guys can hear\nthat on the microphone or not.\n\n213\n00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:07,945\nThe print job is gone, and There we go.\n\n214\n00:10:07,945 --> 00:10:08,785\nThis is a test note.\n\n215\n00:10:08,785 --> 00:10:12,535\nVery exciting moment in\nInternet television history.\n\n216\n00:10:12,535 --> 00:10:13,657\nDon was able to print.\n\n217\n00:10:13,657 --> 00:10:16,315\n[LAUGH] So not the most rewarding thing.\n\n218\n00:10:16,315 --> 00:10:18,592\nBut I'll tell you, in real life land.\n\n219\n00:10:18,592 --> 00:10:20,262\nIf you're out there in the business world,\nand\n\n220\n00:10:20,262 --> 00:10:23,122\nsomebody's printer stops working,\nit's the end of their world.\n\n221\n00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:26,682\nYou could think of no more critical\ncomputer failure than their\n\n222\n00:10:26,682 --> 00:10:27,662\nprinter not working.\n\n223\n00:10:27,662 --> 00:10:32,072\nSo, while this seems really basic,\nit is very important to a lot of people.\n\n224\n00:10:32,072 --> 00:10:35,822\nAll right, now, USB printers\nlike this one are a dying breed.\n\n225\n00:10:35,822 --> 00:10:38,302\nWe really don't see a lot of\nphysical connections anymore, and\n\n226\n00:10:38,302 --> 00:10:40,810\nthe reason is only one person can use it.\n\n227\n00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:42,060\nI've got this USB printer.\n\n228\n00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:43,800\nI hook it up to my computer.\n\n229\n00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,180\nOnly I can use it.\n\n230\n00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:48,850\nIf I want other people to use it,\nwell, I can share it.\n\n231\n00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:52,780\nI can share that printer from my machine\nand then other people can connect.\n\n232\n00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:56,050\nBut what happens if I\nturn my computer off?\n\n233\n00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:59,100\nWell, if I turn my computer off nobody\ncan get to that printer anymore.\n\n234\n00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,680\nSo that's the negative of a USB printer.\n\n235\n00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,970\nBut just for completeness,\n\n236\n00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:06,140\nlet me show you guys how to share\nthis out so other people can see it.\n\n237\n00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:07,630\nAll right.\nIf I go back into my system\n\n238\n00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:10,360\npreferences, right.\n\n239\n00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:13,870\nSo here's my printer, and you'll see,\nso I'm under printers and\n\n240\n00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:15,040\nscanner and my printer.\n\n241\n00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,600\nHere's share this printer on the network.\n\n242\n00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,600\nIn sharing preferences.\n\n243\n00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,130\nSo if I want to share it\nout I can check that, and\n\n244\n00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:24,210\nI can hit my sharing preferences and\nI'll see the options.\n\n245\n00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:27,780\nNow notice where it took me, it took\nme into my sharing system preference,\n\n246\n00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:30,250\nso I could've cut straight to\nthe chase and gone here and\n\n247\n00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:33,980\nset it up, you hit that check mark\nto turn on printer sharing and\n\n248\n00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:37,300\nthen you pick which of your\nprinters you want to share.\n\n249\n00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:39,700\nAnd then you set who's allowed to use it.\n\n250\n00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,740\nYou may not want everyone\nto be able to use it, so\n\n251\n00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:45,960\nyou might choose, no access there and\nadd other people to let them print to it.\n\n252\n00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,010\nSo you can kind of pick and choose.\n\n253\n00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:48,770\nBut now,\n\n254\n00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:53,590\nother people on my network can connect\nto this printer and try and print it.\n\n255\n00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:56,700\nAll right, so\nif I jump over to another box,\n\n256\n00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,920\nlike here I'll jump over to my server.\n\n257\n00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:04,070\nIf I go in to my System Preferences and\nPrinters & Scanners,\n\n258\n00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:08,860\nthis one has Cannon Image runner attached\nto it, but if I hit the plus symbol to add\n\n259\n00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:15,360\na printer, see how it found\nHP Laserjet 5200 at OSX client one?\n\n260\n00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,460\nThat's the one that's shared out from\nmy client on the other side, and\n\n261\n00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:19,730\nit can choose it.\n\n262\n00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:20,590\nIt's going to set it up.\n\n263\n00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:22,450\nIt's loading the driver.\n\n264\n00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:26,050\nAnd it's going to have to download and\ninstall it, but it'll have that access.\n\n265\n00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:31,020\nOn a positive side, now this machine\ncan print to the same printer.\n\n266\n00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:34,920\nOn a negative side, if I go and\nshut down client one,\n\n267\n00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,520\nthen I'm not going to be able to print\nto it from this system any more, right?\n\n268\n00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,600\nThat's the biggest negative\nabout setting up that way.\n\n269\n00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:42,810\nAll right.\n\n270\n00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:46,690\nSo, the new way to do things, the way that\nwe're going to see this more often in real\n\n271\n00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:51,100\nlife land,\nis to use network attached printers.\n\n272\n00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:55,430\nPrinters that are directly plugged\ninto either an ethernet jack or\n\n273\n00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:56,961\ninto your wireless network.\n\n274\n00:12:56,961 --> 00:13:00,390\nWith a network attached printer,\nyou can have one or\n\n275\n00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:04,560\n50 or 500 people all connect to\nthat printer over the network.\n\n276\n00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,750\nAnd no one person controls it.\n\n277\n00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:09,440\nIf you shut off your laptop,\neverybody else can still print,\n\n278\n00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,770\nbecause they're going\nstraight to that printer.\n\n279\n00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:15,010\nAnd you're not limited to\njust one little USB cable.\n\n280\n00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:18,760\nIt's a network connection, so\nall your people can connect to it.\n\n281\n00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:21,980\nThe problem is, we're not going\nto automatically detect it.\n\n282\n00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:26,370\nSo we need to go in and tell our Mac\nthat that network printer exists and\n\n283\n00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:28,150\nthat we want to connect, all right?\n\n284\n00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:32,260\nAnd it's a pretty straight forward\nprocess, there's two ways to go about it\n\n285\n00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:35,980\nin real life I only use one way but\non the exam you may see both so\n\n286\n00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:39,440\nI do want to show you guys\nthe two ways to deal with it.\n\n287\n00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:44,110\nThe way that I normally go I go\ninto System Preferences, and\n\n288\n00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:48,770\ninto Printers & Scanners, and\nI use this little plus button right here.\n\n289\n00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:53,440\nAnd when you hit the plus button, you can\nadd a printer, and it'll scan to try and\n\n290\n00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,900\nfind printers.\n\n291\n00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:57,950\nBut a lot of times it'll turn up there,\nand you're done, right?\n\n292\n00:13:57,950 --> 00:14:01,130\nIf not though,\nyou can go to Add Printer or Scanner.\n\n293\n00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:06,520\nAnd now in here you can tell it what kind\nof printer you're looking for, all right.\n\n294\n00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:09,250\nUnder the default side here you'll\njust see the ones that it's found.\n\n295\n00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:15,510\nSo it's finding that one over on\nmy server, or you can go to IP.\n\n296\n00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:18,340\nAnd under IP you can type\nin the information for\n\n297\n00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:20,730\nthe network printer that\nyou want to attach to.\n\n298\n00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:21,330\nAll right?\n\n299\n00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:24,620\nSo, that printer that's sitting beside me,\nit's got a network jack in it, and\n\n300\n00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:28,260\nit's plugged into the network, and\nmaybe I want to print to it, so\n\n301\n00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:32,540\nI can come in and punch in its IP address,\nif I can remember it.\n\n302\n00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:33,470\nThere we go.\n\n303\n00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:36,280\nAnd it's reaching out to that\nprinter right now to see if it can\n\n304\n00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:39,920\nfigure out what kind of printer it is,\nand if it does, we'll see it update.\n\n305\n00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:40,870\nIn fact, right there.\n\n306\n00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:42,170\nUse HP Laserjet 5200.\n\n307\n00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:43,240\nIt figured it out.\n\n308\n00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,570\nIt knows what that printer is.\n\n309\n00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:47,310\nNow the name is the IP address.\n\n310\n00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:50,080\nI'm going to change that cause otherwise\nI'll never remember what this is.\n\n311\n00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:54,270\nSo I'm just going to call\nit the HP Laserjet 5200.\n\n312\n00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:58,570\nFor the protocol, see there's three\ndifferent protocols to choose from.\n\n313\n00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:01,010\nThe internet printing protocol IPP?\n\n314\n00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:04,260\nThat's one we can use to print\nacross wide area networks.\n\n315\n00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:06,940\nWe've got LPD, the line printer demon.\n\n316\n00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:12,350\nThat is the UNIX printing protocol, which\nApple had a large part in influencing.\n\n317\n00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:14,620\nThere's a whole subsystem called cups.\n\n318\n00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:19,350\nThe Common UNIX Printing System and\nApple practically wrote the whole thing.\n\n319\n00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:21,780\nSo, LPD is what we normally want.\n\n320\n00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:26,490\nBut then we also have\nHP Jet Direct Socket.\n\n321\n00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:28,520\nNow this is an HP printer, and\n\n322\n00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:31,850\nif I crack it open it's actually\ngot a JetDirect card in it.\n\n323\n00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:34,070\nSo I know that's what it is.\n\n324\n00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:35,740\nIf I choose that,\n\n325\n00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:40,160\nI may get better compatibility with\nthat printer because it's a JetDirect.\n\n326\n00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,890\nBut the HP is fully LPD compatible also.\n\n327\n00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:46,300\nSo it's up to me which\none I want to choose.\n\n328\n00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:49,100\nThere may be a feature with one\nthat I prefer over the other but\n\n329\n00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,330\nI'm going to go ahead and\njust stick with the LPD.\n\n330\n00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:50,830\nAll right.\n\n331\n00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:54,010\nSo I'll go ahead and add that.\n\n332\n00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:57,260\nAnd now, it's just letting me know\nthat it already exists because I've\n\n333\n00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:58,090\nalready connected to it.\n\n334\n00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:01,020\nI'm going to go ahead and\ncontinue to create a new one.\n\n335\n00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:01,724\nThere we go.\n\n336\n00:16:01,724 --> 00:16:07,585\nNow, when I connected via USB, it was able\nto identify all of my hardware for me.\n\n337\n00:16:07,585 --> 00:16:11,324\nBut going over the network,\nit's not able to identify it.\n\n338\n00:16:11,324 --> 00:16:14,460\nSo see here how it's asking\nme all these questions?\n\n339\n00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:17,810\nI need to go through and tell it what\nhardware it's got and whether or\n\n340\n00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:21,010\nnot it supports some of\nthe features that we saw earlier.\n\n341\n00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:23,300\nAnd so I'm just gonna come through and\n\n342\n00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:27,970\ntell it some of the different options that\nI wanna set there, and then I'll say OK.\n\n343\n00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:29,440\nAnd now I've got it.\n\n344\n00:16:31,462 --> 00:16:35,040\nAll right, so when I look at\nthese I can see the printer.\n\n345\n00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:40,210\nI've got one that's idle and one that\nis offline and that's because you can't\n\n346\n00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:43,750\nreally be, actually this one's offline\nbecause I unplugged the USB connection.\n\n347\n00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:45,270\nSo that's my USB one.\n\n348\n00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:47,400\nI'm going to get rid of it,\ncuz I don't need it anymore.\n\n349\n00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,150\nSo, I'll just delete\nthat one out of there.\n\n350\n00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:51,920\nAnd now I've just got this one\nwhich is the one that was connected\n\n351\n00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,320\nvia the network.\n\n352\n00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,040\nAll right.\n\n353\n00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:57,230\nAnd I can share it out if I want to but\nit's a network printer so\n\n354\n00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:59,120\nthere's really no need to share it out.\n\n355\n00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,590\nOther people can do just what I did and\nconnect direct to that printer and\n\n356\n00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:05,090\nnot depend on my machine to get there.\n\n357\n00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:08,700\nThat's really the better\nway to go about it.\n\n358\n00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:09,200\nAll right.\n\n359\n00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:14,390\nWe've seen an IP printer, and\nwe've seen a USB printer.\n\n360\n00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:16,440\nNow, I did do an HP both times.\n\n361\n00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:21,330\nLet me just add another one, just so\nwe can see a completely different server.\n\n362\n00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:22,120\nI'll go to IP here.\n\n363\n00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:26,010\nI'm going to punch in one\nthat's across our office.\n\n364\n00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:31,660\nThis one is a Canon imageRUNNER 7065\nAdvanced, or something like that.\n\n365\n00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:34,150\nAnd, you'll see that it\nwasn't able to identify it.\n\n366\n00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:36,790\nIt knows it's a generic\npost script printer, so\n\n367\n00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:41,230\nif nothing else it supports post script,\nbut it's just kind of leaving me there and\n\n368\n00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:42,970\nthat's all the information I get.\n\n369\n00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:46,010\nWell, the printer is a post script\nprinter, so that's compatible,\n\n370\n00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:46,995\nI can stick with that.\n\n371\n00:17:46,995 --> 00:17:53,171\nI'm just going to rename it as\na Canon imageRunner 7065 advanced.\n\n372\n00:17:53,171 --> 00:17:53,671\nAll right.\n\n373\n00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:55,680\nAnd I'll go ahead and add that.\n\n374\n00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,450\nNow, because I'm going so\n\n375\n00:17:57,450 --> 00:18:02,150\ngeneric on this one,\nit's not identifying any of the hardware.\n\n376\n00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:06,260\nNow I know that printer,\nit's a huge office printer.\n\n377\n00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:09,483\nIt's got a magazine attachment to it,\nit's got a stapler, it's got\n\n378\n00:18:09,483 --> 00:18:13,750\na three hole puncher, it's got all sorts\nof crazy bells and whistles on it.\n\n379\n00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:17,094\nBut here we weren't able\nto identify any of that.\n\n380\n00:18:17,094 --> 00:18:20,789\nAnd so now I've added this,\nwhat I know is a massive printer and\n\n381\n00:18:20,789 --> 00:18:23,393\nmy system is gonna see it very,\nvery basic.\n\n382\n00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:24,388\nAll right.\n\n383\n00:18:24,388 --> 00:18:28,492\nIn this scenario this is not going\nto be the best solution for me.\n\n384\n00:18:28,492 --> 00:18:31,926\nI really need to go out and\nget the third party driver.\n\n385\n00:18:31,926 --> 00:18:36,501\nThe driver from the vendors that I have\nthe full ability to be able to work with\n\n386\n00:18:36,501 --> 00:18:37,797\nthis stuff, right.\n\n387\n00:18:37,797 --> 00:18:41,700\nSo that's something that I would need to\ndo to get this one completely correct.\n\n388\n00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:44,070\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and remove it.\n\n389\n00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:47,730\nAnd we can go to Cannon's webpage or\nwhatever.\n\n390\n00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:50,490\nIf I can remember it all.\n\n391\n00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:51,860\nAnd we can find their driver.\n\n392\n00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:55,040\nAnd their website is\nnot the easiest to use,\n\n393\n00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:58,400\nso let's see if we can do this\nin a short amount of time.\n\n394\n00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,880\nSo that is office equipment.\n\n395\n00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:05,000\nWe've got a color imageRUNNER advance.\n\n396\n00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,810\nAnd it is a 7065, there it is.\n\n397\n00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:11,094\nAnd I'll go into my drivers.\n\n398\n00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:15,460\nAnd so I'm just going to go in here and\nfind my driver.\n\n399\n00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:18,710\nIt recognized that I'm running Maverick so\nthat's useful.\n\n400\n00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:21,680\nAnd then I've got lots of\ndrivers to pick from here.\n\n401\n00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,380\nOkay.\n\n402\n00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:25,960\nI've got some that support the fax\nsystem if I want to be able to send fax.\n\n403\n00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:29,420\nI've got others that are post script and\nyet others,\n\n404\n00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:32,530\nI probably have some in here that\nare PCL so like different languages.\n\n405\n00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:37,280\nBut they have a unified driver, and that's\nwhat I'm gonna use is this UFRII one.\n\n406\n00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,560\nSo I'll go ahead and take that one.\n\n407\n00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,610\nAnd let me just sign their agreement.\n\n408\n00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:46,010\nWhich I read thoroughly before clicking\non it by the way, just so you know.\n\n409\n00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:48,294\nA responsible legal agreement.\n\n410\n00:19:48,294 --> 00:19:50,487\n[LAUGH] And so\nI'm gonna download this driver.\n\n411\n00:19:50,487 --> 00:19:54,704\nNow the big advantage here is,\nwhen I use their driver my system is going\n\n412\n00:19:54,704 --> 00:19:58,656\nto get full support for all the bells and\nwhistles of that printer.\n\n413\n00:19:58,656 --> 00:20:02,340\nAnd it's got a lot of bells and whistles,\nit's got more than I care to know.\n\n414\n00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:05,780\nSo, it's just a little package file\nhere so I'll get that installed, and\n\n415\n00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:08,510\nwe'll be able to add that printer in.\n\n416\n00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:10,570\nAll right, the install for\na driver like this,\n\n417\n00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:13,910\nyou're really just clicking next\na bunch of times so I'm just gonna hit.\n\n418\n00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:16,980\nWell, I'm gonna hit next a bunch\nof times and let it install.\n\n419\n00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:20,160\nBut once it installs then I have to\ngo through the process of adding that\n\n420\n00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,940\nprinter so\nwe'll get that done here in just a minute.\n\n421\n00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,290\nAll right.\n\n422\n00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:26,960\nSo, we've seen just\nregular Apple printing.\n\n423\n00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,850\nRight?\nAdding a printer is real easy and\n\n424\n00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:29,490\nsharing it out.\n\n425\n00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:33,284\nAnd then we can obviously connect that\nfrom other Macs really, really easy.\n\n426\n00:20:33,284 --> 00:20:34,584\nDirect IP printing.\n\n427\n00:20:34,584 --> 00:20:36,200\nAgain, not a very hard thing.\n\n428\n00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:40,050\nWe just have to plug in the IP address and\nthe information on the printer.\n\n429\n00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:44,460\nThe other connection we have is\nto connect to a Windows printer.\n\n430\n00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:45,110\nAll right.\n\n431\n00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:48,000\nIf somebody has a printer\non a Windows based machine.\n\n432\n00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,120\nWindows 7 or Windows Server or whatever,\nwe can connect to that printer\n\n433\n00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:55,560\ntoo using SMB,\nusing the server message block Protocol.\n\n434\n00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,948\nAll right?\nSo, to do that I want to show you guys\n\n435\n00:20:57,948 --> 00:20:59,935\nthe other way to add a printer.\n\n436\n00:20:59,935 --> 00:21:02,980\nI'm waiting on this driver to install\nanyway, so it's a good enough time.\n\n437\n00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:06,660\nSo, a moment ago, I went into system\npreferences, and I went into printers and\n\n438\n00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:09,700\nscanners, and\nI used the plus sign to add a printer.\n\n439\n00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:12,490\nBut on the exam, you're just as\nlikely to see this other way.\n\n440\n00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:15,950\nThe other way we can add a printer\nis to go into an application\n\n441\n00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:17,560\nthat we want to print from.\n\n442\n00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:21,620\nSo if I want to print from here,\nwe can go to File and Print.\n\n443\n00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:26,030\nSo I just launch notes, and\nin notes I'm going to File and Print, and\n\n444\n00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:29,490\nfrom here you'll see the default\nprinter that it's gonna print to.\n\n445\n00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:32,830\nIf you drop that down\nyou can add a printer\n\n446\n00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:34,940\nright from the system print dialogue.\n\n447\n00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:37,510\nAll right, so this is the other\nway that we can add a printer.\n\n448\n00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:41,670\nYou just go into any software,\nchoose the print option and\n\n449\n00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:44,200\nfrom the print dialogue,\nchoose to add a printer.\n\n450\n00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:48,470\nWhen you do that, it's gonna take you to\nthe same place as system preferences.\n\n451\n00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:52,160\nSo just be aware there's two different\nways to get to the same place.\n\n452\n00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,220\nAnd from here we can add a printer.\n\n453\n00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:59,100\nIf it's a Windows printer, we just choose\nWindows and it will scan the network.\n\n454\n00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:02,120\nAnd so mine just found the lab domain.\n\n455\n00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:05,400\nAnd there's WinClient 1, and\nmaybe that's the one I want to connect to.\n\n456\n00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,300\nSo it's prompting me for\n\n457\n00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:09,980\na password to connect,\na password that I apparently don't know.\n\n458\n00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:12,200\nOh, my username's wrong.\n\n459\n00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:12,700\nThere we go.\n\n460\n00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:19,000\nSo it'll connect, and\nif there's a printer there we'll see it.\n\n461\n00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:19,700\nApparently there is not.\n\n462\n00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:20,460\nLet me try the server.\n\n463\n00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:24,680\nSomewhere I have a Windows printer.\n\n464\n00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,350\nWe will find one.\n\n465\n00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:27,144\nThere we go.\n\n466\n00:22:27,144 --> 00:22:30,924\nSo on this Windows server\nI've got a Lexmark E323.\n\n467\n00:22:30,924 --> 00:22:33,915\nSo I'll choose that, and\ndown here it's got the Lexmark, and\n\n468\n00:22:33,915 --> 00:22:35,902\nthen I can pick a driver\nthat I want to use.\n\n469\n00:22:35,902 --> 00:22:39,336\nIf I've got specific software for\nthat one I can use it or\n\n470\n00:22:39,336 --> 00:22:42,610\nif I just want to try PCL or\nPostscript, I can.\n\n471\n00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:46,880\nPostscript is a generic printing language\nthat almost every printer supports, so\n\n472\n00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:47,800\nI'm gonna go with Postscript.\n\n473\n00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,240\nAnd I'll just add that in,\nand there we go.\n\n474\n00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:53,440\nNow, just like the Canon,\n\n475\n00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:58,090\nthis Lexmark E323 probably has some other\nfeatures that aren't showing up here, so\n\n476\n00:22:58,090 --> 00:23:01,410\nI won't see that unless I go and\ninstall the full-fledged driver.\n\n477\n00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:04,980\nBut right there I just connected\nto that Windows machine, and\n\n478\n00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:06,460\nI should now have its printer.\n\n479\n00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:11,250\nIf I go into my printer preferences\nI've got an HP Laserjet 5200 and\n\n480\n00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:12,880\na Lexmark E323.\n\n481\n00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,710\nThat's the one that's coming\nfrom the Windows server.\n\n482\n00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:19,730\nAll right, let's go see how my\nother add dialogue is going.\n\n483\n00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:25,490\nSo this is that Canon software I was\ninstalling, and it looks like it is done.\n\n484\n00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:27,468\nNow that installed the software.\n\n485\n00:23:27,468 --> 00:23:32,510\nNow I need to go back to Add a Printer and\nI can add in that printer now\n\n486\n00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:37,484\nI've already added oh no that's\nthe server let's add it here.\n\n487\n00:23:37,484 --> 00:23:43,843\nSo I'm going to add in 10.1.10.23, and\nfor my protocol I can stick with LDP.\n\n488\n00:23:43,843 --> 00:23:47,061\nAnd down here it's trying to\nidentify the printer, and\n\n489\n00:23:47,061 --> 00:23:50,840\nwhen I go to identify it,\nI've got this Select Software option.\n\n490\n00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:56,170\nAnd we can choose that, and now in the\nSelect Software, I see a nice big list.\n\n491\n00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:59,437\nAnd since I installed that\nCanon imageRUNNER software,\n\n492\n00:23:59,437 --> 00:24:03,392\nI should be able to find that printer\nin this list somewhere, there.\n\n493\n00:24:03,392 --> 00:24:06,548\nCannon imageRunner advanced, 6075.\n\n494\n00:24:06,548 --> 00:24:11,646\nSo I used the Select Software option\nto be able to pick the correct driver.\n\n495\n00:24:11,646 --> 00:24:17,285\nSo now I pick that Canon\nimage runner at Advance 6075.\n\n496\n00:24:17,285 --> 00:24:18,330\nAnd let me just name it that.\n\n497\n00:24:23,623 --> 00:24:25,320\nThere we go.\n\n498\n00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:28,520\nAnd so it's going to add it in and\nnow I've got that printer.\n\n499\n00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,640\nAnd so I can print to it.\n\n500\n00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:33,560\nAnd if I, let me just cancel out of that.\n\n501\n00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:38,630\nIf I go back to my system preferences and\ngo into that printer section,\n\n502\n00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:42,730\nI'll go into that Canon ImageRunner,\nand I'll go into options and supplies.\n\n503\n00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:46,740\nAnd before, the only option I had was\nwhether I had a duplex unit or not.\n\n504\n00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:49,540\nNow when I go into options,\nI've got a lot more.\n\n505\n00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:51,350\nDo I have a paper deck unit?\n\n506\n00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:53,205\nWhat are my output options?\n\n507\n00:24:53,205 --> 00:24:55,760\nRight?\nDo I wanna use the staple finisher or\n\n508\n00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,250\nthe booklet finisher?\n\n509\n00:24:57,250 --> 00:25:01,800\nI've got a ton of choices because\nthat driver enabled all of this.\n\n510\n00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,290\nThat one's got five trays of paper.\n\n511\n00:25:04,290 --> 00:25:05,660\nIt's a massive printer.\n\n512\n00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:09,100\nIt's one of those super\npowerful office printers.\n\n513\n00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:11,970\nSo now I've got all\nthat full functionality\n\n514\n00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:13,745\nbecause I installed\nthe appropriate driver.\n\n515\n00:25:13,745 --> 00:25:15,750\nRight?\nSo that is a big piece.\n\n516\n00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:19,830\nIf you do your software updates for\nMac OS, you should have the latest printer\n\n517\n00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:23,140\ndrivers for most printers, and so\nyou won't have to do this step.\n\n518\n00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:27,310\nBut if it's a really fancy printer, or\nif it's a printer that's just not very\n\n519\n00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:31,542\npopular, then you may need to go out and\ndownload the software for it.\n\n520\n00:25:31,542 --> 00:25:33,000\nAll right.\nThere's a lot of software that's\n\n521\n00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:33,870\nalready included.\n\n522\n00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:38,090\nAnd if I hit add a printer,\nand I take a look at\n\n523\n00:25:39,810 --> 00:25:44,130\nthe select software screen,\nmine is packed full of Canon software, but\n\n524\n00:25:44,130 --> 00:25:48,160\nif I scroll down there's a bunch of HP,\nand is that about it?\n\n525\n00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:48,900\nYeah, that's about it.\n\n526\n00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:52,170\nSo I don't have\nthe Lexmark E323 that I had.\n\n527\n00:25:52,170 --> 00:25:53,280\nIt is not in the list.\n\n528\n00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:55,880\nSo I'd want to go out and\ndownload that software from them so\n\n529\n00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:58,680\nI can enable all the features\nof that printer.\n\n530\n00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,958\nBut as far as basic printing,\nthat's all I need.\n\n531\n00:26:00,958 --> 00:26:02,964\nAll right?\n\n532\n00:26:02,964 --> 00:26:04,460\nSo, remember for the exam,\n\n533\n00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:07,526\nthe three main printer types we're\ngonna see are Apple Printers.\n\n534\n00:26:07,526 --> 00:26:10,470\nRight?\nPrinters shared from other Apple systems.\n\n535\n00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:12,830\nThere's IP based printers.\n\n536\n00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:15,803\nAnd, IP printers are available\nvia ethernet or wireless.\n\n537\n00:26:15,803 --> 00:26:17,596\nRight?\nThere's not really much difference.\n\n538\n00:26:17,596 --> 00:26:21,490\nAnd then the last one is through\na Windows system, through SMB, and\n\n539\n00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:23,080\nwe just have those options right here.\n\n540\n00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:27,043\nThey really don't hit facts on the exam\nanymore, cuz because who uses facts.\n\n541\n00:26:27,043 --> 00:26:27,624\nRight?\n\n542\n00:26:27,624 --> 00:26:32,190\n[LAUGH] I'm sure somebody still uses\nfacts, if you're a lawyer or whatever.\n\n543\n00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:35,510\nLet's see, what am I missing,\nI feel like I'm forgetting something.\n\n544\n00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:40,620\nSo those are some of the main things with\nour printer, we can easily share them\n\n545\n00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:45,200\nI showed you sharing, adding, removing\nthem, there's not really too much to them.\n\n546\n00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,160\nAs far as the sharing side,\nit's really just like sharing a folder for\n\n547\n00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,230\nthe file sharing.\n\n548\n00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:51,470\nWe do need to make sure\nthat sharing is turned on.\n\n549\n00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:54,200\nAnd for me, I went a roundabout\nway to it a moment ago.\n\n550\n00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,540\nLet me go back to that.\n\n551\n00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:57,590\nIf I go into my system preferences and\n\n552\n00:26:57,590 --> 00:27:01,100\nI go to sharing, you'll see that\nprinter sharing right there.\n\n553\n00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:06,480\nSo if I wanted to turn on sharing for\nthat Canon image runner, I could turn\n\n554\n00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:10,580\nthat on and set it to everyone can print,\nnow people could use me to print to it.\n\n555\n00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:11,320\nBut, like I said,\n\n556\n00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:13,990\nif it's a network printer you\nreally shouldn't use this option.\n\n557\n00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:15,630\nPeople should print to it directly,\n\n558\n00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:17,940\nthat way you're not dependent\non a single machine.\n\n559\n00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:18,540\nAll right.\n\n560\n00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:21,930\nSo pros and cons of any solution, but\nthat's kind of the recommendation.\n\n561\n00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:24,200\nAll right.\n\n562\n00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:27,910\nIf you no longer need a printer, you just\ngo back in your system preferences and\n\n563\n00:27:27,910 --> 00:27:28,750\ninto printers and\n\n564\n00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:32,280\nscanners, and you can take any of\nthose printers and just remove them.\n\n565\n00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:34,750\nHit that minus sign and off it goes.\n\n566\n00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:35,280\nAll right.\n\n567\n00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:37,260\nJust keep in mind if it's shared out,\n\n568\n00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:40,830\nthe other people who might have connected\nto it will still have entries for it.\n\n569\n00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:44,080\nSo they might start to get errors or\nstuck print jobs in their queue.\n\n570\n00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:47,530\nSo you'll wanna make sure you communicate\nthat to anybody that was connected to it\n\n571\n00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:48,412\nvia the share system.\n\n572\n00:27:48,412 --> 00:27:49,200\nAll right?\n\n573\n00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,690\nBut, otherwise if it was just you,\nyou can remove it, no big deal.\n\n574\n00:27:52,690 --> 00:27:55,050\nIt's gone and\nnow you don't have to worry anymore.\n\n575\n00:27:55,050 --> 00:27:56,000\nAll right.\n\n576\n00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,990\nSo that's about it for printing.\n\n577\n00:27:57,990 --> 00:28:01,700\nThere's not too much else we can\nreally talk about on this one.\n\n578\n00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:05,390\nSo for the exam,\nthose are the main things to remember, and\n\n579\n00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:06,960\nthose are the main things\nyou'll see in real life.\n\n580\n00:28:08,150 --> 00:28:11,130\nAll right, well let me just remind you\nguys that if you have any questions\n\n581\n00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:13,510\non

00:00:38,260\nwelcome back to another\nepisode of ITProtv.\n\n4\n00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:44,640\nI'm your host Don Pezet back again with\nanother episode of MAC Integration Basics.\n\n5\n00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,120\nAll right, this show's gonna be a short\none because we got a really simple topic\n\n6\n00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,750\nto hit here which is Instant Messaging.\n\n7\n00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:54,550\nI know, some of you are like hey,\nI remember AOL.\n\n8\n00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:57,750\nWe were joking about ICQ before the show.\n\n9\n00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:00,770\nInstant messaging has kind of seen\nits day in the sun and gone away.\n\n10\n00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:03,970\nBut there is still a lot of use for\nit in various organization.\n\n11\n00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:07,400\nWe use it here in the studio\nactually quite a bit.\n\n12\n00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,360\nIf there's a show going on,\n\n13\n00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,510\nlike right now, our desks are just right\nover here in the other side of the studio.\n\n14\n00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:17,310\nSo the guys can't really talk and\nshare information during the show, so\n\n15\n00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:18,420\nthey use instant messaging.\n\n16\n00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:22,000\nWe just kinda chat on the PCs between\neach other to be able to communicate.\n\n17\n00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,900\nSo it is still a very useful thing\nto have in the business world, but\n\n18\n00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:28,130\nit is useful on a personal level, too.\n\n19\n00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:31,250\nApple has really upgraded\ntheir messaging client.\n\n20\n00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:36,640\nNow, Apple or iMessage is a software\npackage that's included with Mac OS and\n\n21\n00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,520\nwe can use it for instant messaging.\n\n22\n00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,100\nAnd we can use it not just\nwith Apple services, but\n\n23\n00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,310\nwith all sorts of services\nthat are out there.\n\n24\n00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:48,690\nSo it's kind of, your one-stop shop for\nmessaging connectivity inside of Mac OS.\n\n25\n00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:51,890\nAll right, so let's take a quick look at\niMessage and how it works and what it\n\n26\n00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:55,162\ndoes and kinda get an example of some of\nthe things we need to know for the exam.\n\n27\n00:01:55,162 --> 00:01:56,450\nAll right,\n\n28\n00:01:56,450 --> 00:02:02,330\nnow iMessage by default if we fire it\nup it wants to work with well iMessage.\n\n29\n00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:08,090\nThat name iMessage the app itself is\nactually just called messages and\n\n30\n00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:09,590\nwhen we launch it you see iMessage.\n\n31\n00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:14,140\nNow In real life land,\npeople use those terms interchangeably.\n\n32\n00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:17,700\nBut on the exam, I want you to\nseparate it out in your mind.\n\n33\n00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:20,640\nMessages is the program,\n\n34\n00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,570\niMessage is actually a chat service\nthat's integrated with iCloud.\n\n35\n00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:28,010\nIt's part of the Apple iCloud solution.\n\n36\n00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:32,570\nSo, when you sign in to iMessage, you're\nactually signing in to that iCloud part,\n\n37\n00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:36,570\nand that's why it's asking for\nan Apple ID and password.\n\n38\n00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:41,060\nIf I wanna connect to iMessage,\nI'm gonna have to punch in whatever my\n\n39\n00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:46,290\nApple ID is, and let me just punch in.\n\n40\n00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:49,810\nMy little lab one here and Sign In.\n\n41\n00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:51,560\nAnd so it's gonna connect up to iCloud.\n\n42\n00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,540\nIf you've already got an apple\nidea you can do this.\n\n43\n00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:56,080\nIt's free, so\nit doesn't cost anything extra.\n\n44\n00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,400\nBut it'll connect up, and\n\n45\n00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:01,805\nnow I'm ready to chat away with all\nmy buddies, in which I have none.\n\n46\n00:03:01,805 --> 00:03:05,185\n[LAUGH] if I had any friends,\nthey'd be over hear in my list.\n\n47\n00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:06,420\nRight?\nSo,\n\n48\n00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,740\niMessage which is integrated with Apple.\n\n49\n00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:12,980\nYou do need an Apple ID and\nit goes entirely through their services.\n\n50\n00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:14,730\nNow it is a secure communication.\n\n51\n00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:19,660\nIt uses SSL to encrypt your chats when\nit sends them up to Apple servers and\n\n52\n00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:20,980\nback again.\n\n53\n00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:23,330\nAll right?\nSo, you do have some basic security there,\n\n54\n00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:24,930\nbut you can chat with people.\n\n55\n00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:29,580\nOne of the biggest advantages of\niMessage is that if you have an iPhone\n\n56\n00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:33,390\nthat you can run iMessage, or\nconnect to iMessage on your iPhone.\n\n57\n00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:36,300\nAnd then you can send SMS text through it.\n\n58\n00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:40,380\nThat means that from your desktop,\nyou could come in here and craft a text\n\n59\n00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:44,200\nmessage in that to field, instead of\na person you could put in a phone number,\n\n60\n00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,968\nand then it would then send\na text message to that number.\n\n61\n00:03:46,968 --> 00:03:51,990\nSo you kinda get integrated chat and\nSMS, or text messaging, in one client.\n\n62\n00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:52,976\nSo kind of a cool thing.\n\n63\n00:03:52,976 --> 00:03:54,212\nAll right.\n\n64\n00:03:54,212 --> 00:03:55,910\nNow, iMessage.\n\n65\n00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:59,890\nIt's great for home users,\npersonal users but in a business,\n\n66\n00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:02,770\nthere's some little\nproblems with iMessage.\n\n67\n00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:05,100\nProblem number one,\nyou gotta have an Apple ID.\n\n68\n00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:07,050\nRight?\nSo all of your people that wanna use\n\n69\n00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:08,140\nit have to go out and sign up for\n\n70\n00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:10,970\nan Apple ID,\nwhich is something beyond your control.\n\n71\n00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:12,400\nAn account that you don't control.\n\n72\n00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,050\nAll right?\n\n73\n00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:16,300\nThe second thing is you\ndon't get chat records.\n\n74\n00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:19,710\nSo you don't get recordings or\narchives of all the chats that happen.\n\n75\n00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:22,070\nSo your employees could be chatting\nabout all sorts of stuff, and\n\n76\n00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:23,210\nyou don't necessarily know about it.\n\n77\n00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:26,910\nBecause it's going through secure\ncommunications to Apple servers\n\n78\n00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:28,610\nthat you don't have access to.\n\n79\n00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:32,790\nSo in a corporate environment,\niMessage is not a great solution.\n\n80\n00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:35,570\nSo that means we just throw out\nthe messaging client altogether.\n\n81\n00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:36,230\nRight?\n\n82\n00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:37,480\nWell, no.\n\n83\n00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:40,675\nWhile it never mentioned it to me here,\n\n84\n00:04:40,675 --> 00:04:45,920\niMessages does actually support quite\na few other connectivity methods.\n\n85\n00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,880\niMessage is just one of them.\n\n86\n00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,400\nAnd that's where it's confusing.\n\n87\n00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:55,000\nFor an end user, they view iMessage and\nMessages as the same thing, but Messages\n\n88\n00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,520\nis a client that can connect to several\ntypes of servers, not just iMessage.\n\n89\n00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,240\nAll right.\n\n90\n00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:05,120\nIf we go up top here to our messages menu,\nand go into preferences,\n\n91\n00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,375\nin our preferences you see some of\nthe accounts that we're connected to.\n\n92\n00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:10,500\nRight?\nIf you start on\n\n93\n00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,500\nthe general tab you might have\nto switch to accounts, but\n\n94\n00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,920\nunder the accounting tab you'll\nsee who you're setup for.\n\n95\n00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,770\nAnd I can see right now\nI'm tied to iMessage, and\n\n96\n00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:20,362\nit's listed as inactive cuz\nI'm not chatting right now.\n\n97\n00:05:20,362 --> 00:05:21,560\nAll right.\n\n98\n00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,640\nIt also has another entry here for\nBonjour.\n\n99\n00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,080\nWhat's that all about?\n\n100\n00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:30,140\nWell, all of your Mac OS devices are\nrunning the Bonjour protocol which allows\n\n101\n00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:33,460\nthem to discover other\ndevices on the network.\n\n102\n00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:39,000\nIf we turn on Bonjour instant messaging,\nit's gonna look out\n\n103\n00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,302\nonto the network and see if it can find\nanybody else with Bonjour turned on.\n\n104\n00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:45,310\nAll right.\nAnd\n\n105\n00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:49,470\nif they are then it will automatically\nfind them and now you can chat locally.\n\n106\n00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:53,390\nNow that's a direct chat going from\nyour client to their client and\n\n107\n00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:54,900\nyou can exchange information.\n\n108\n00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:57,620\nIt does it securely and\nyou can communicate.\n\n109\n00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:00,100\nBut there's not really a whole\nlot of authentication here.\n\n110\n00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:01,530\nSo if you go into a Starbucks and\n\n111\n00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:04,450\nyou've got this turned on,\nother people might have it on, too.\n\n112\n00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:06,900\nAnd then you might start\ngetting communications.\n\n113\n00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:10,530\nSo you'll see other things here,\nlike blocking people from seeing your idle\n\n114\n00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:16,050\nstatus, publishing your email and instant\nmessage addresses so people can see it.\n\n115\n00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:22,120\nYou may or may not want to turn those on,\nbased on your own privacy requirement.\n\n116\n00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:22,880\nAll right.\n\n117\n00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,060\nSo, I'm gonna turn that one off here.\n\n118\n00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:29,280\nThat one still has some of\nthe same problems of iMessage,\n\n119\n00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,230\nwhich is if you're\na corporate environment,\n\n120\n00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:33,760\nyou don't have a lot of control\nover the Bonjour connections.\n\n121\n00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,490\nPeople are connective independently, and\n\n122\n00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:37,680\nyou're not necessarily\nin the middle of that.\n\n123\n00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,700\nSo for a business we might rely on\na separate server to manage things.\n\n124\n00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:48,540\nWell, iMessages is actually compatible\nwith a lot of different servers.\n\n125\n00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:51,480\nUnder Accounts,\nif we hit the plus sign down here,\n\n126\n00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:54,830\nyou'll see that we can connect to Google,\nYahoo!, and AOL.\n\n127\n00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:58,090\nRight?\nThose are some of the three major chat\n\n128\n00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:00,410\nproviders out there on the Internet.\n\n129\n00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:02,850\nGoogle through their Google Hangouts now,\nbut\n\n130\n00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:05,260\nwhat used to be their little chat service.\n\n131\n00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:09,830\nYou've got Yahoo for their Yahoo chat,\nand AOL Instant Messenger, AIM.\n\n132\n00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:14,100\nAnd so you could choose any of these\nservices and hit Continue, and\n\n133\n00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:18,350\nyou just punch in your email address and\npassword to log into that service, and\n\n134\n00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:20,730\nnow you're communicating with AOL.\n\n135\n00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:21,360\nRight?\nAnd\n\n136\n00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,130\nyou could actually add all of these in.\n\n137\n00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:26,140\nYou could add in ten different services\nand now you're connected to all of them,\n\n138\n00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:29,100\nand you have one single chat client\nmanaging it, which is kind of nice.\n\n139\n00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:31,360\nAll right, but\n\n140\n00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:37,200\nin a corporate environment we probably\nwanna set up our own chat server.\n\n141\n00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:37,810\nAll right?\n\n142\n00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:41,910\nAnd, if you've got a server\nthat's running the server app,\n\n143\n00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:46,372\nyou can go to messages and\nit's actually got its own chat server.\n\n144\n00:07:46,372 --> 00:07:47,780\nAll right?\n\n145\n00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:50,030\nIn the instant messaging world,\n\n146\n00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:54,982\nthere's a open source protocol that is\nvery commonly used that's called Jabber.\n\n147\n00:07:54,982 --> 00:07:55,780\nAll right.\n\n148\n00:07:55,780 --> 00:08:02,360\nIt's also called the extensible messaging,\nsomething XMPP, I forget exactly what it\n\n149\n00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:07,840\nstands for but XMPP is another name for\nit Jabber and XMPP are the same thing.\n\n150\n00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:12,325\nAnd that is an open protocol\nthat a lot of people support.\n\n151\n00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:15,575\nI mentioned that we use it and\nwe use chat here in the office,\n\n152\n00:08:15,575 --> 00:08:19,755\nwell we have a voice over IP\nsystem here for our phones.\n\n153\n00:08:19,755 --> 00:08:25,840\nOur phones are all network phones and\nit provides XMPP chat services also.\n\n154\n00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,300\nAnd so we take our systems.\n\n155\n00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:32,050\nLike my Mac, I've got my messaging app\nset up to connect up to our Voip system.\n\n156\n00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:34,590\nSo I can get chat messages as\nwell as my phone calls and\n\n157\n00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:36,220\nother things via that same system.\n\n158\n00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:37,800\nIt's kind of convenient.\n\n159\n00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:38,460\nAll right.\n\n160\n00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:41,500\nSo here I've just turned\non that messages system.\n\n161\n00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:44,750\nWhen you turn it on there's not\nreally a whole lot to configure.\n\n162\n00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:49,310\nAnybody you've got defined in users\nwill now be able to connect up and\n\n163\n00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:50,230\nstart to chat.\n\n164\n00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:52,340\nStart to exchange information.\n\n165\n00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:55,500\nSo I can jump back over here and\n\n166\n00:08:55,500 --> 00:09:00,210\nif I go to add an account I can\nchoose other messages account.\n\n167\n00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:04,750\nAnd when I hit Continue, I'll see\nAOL Instant Messenger, Google Talk,\n\n168\n00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:07,070\nYahoo and Jabber.\n\n169\n00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:07,670\nAll right.\n\n170\n00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:09,420\nFor the exam, remember that Jabber and\n\n171\n00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:12,265\nXMPP are the same thing,\nit's the same protocol.\n\n172\n00:09:12,265 --> 00:09:15,005\nSo I can connect to any Jabber\nserver that's out there.\n\n173\n00:09:15,005 --> 00:09:15,855\nSo I'm gonna connect to mine.\n\n174\n00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:17,515\nIt's asking for an account name.\n\n175\n00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:20,785\nNow in the XMPP world,\nthe accounts work like this,\n\n176\n00:09:20,785 --> 00:09:25,045\nit's your user name,\n@, and the server name.\n\n177\n00:09:25,045 --> 00:09:29,115\nSo my server is osx.server1.local.\n\n178\n00:09:29,115 --> 00:09:31,865\nSo I'll put that in,\nthen I'll put in my password.\n\n179\n00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:36,410\nAnd next, you can put in the server name.\n\n180\n00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:42,570\nSo, mine was osxserver1.local, and\nthen whether or not you're using SSL.\n\n181\n00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:43,560\nAll right?\n\n182\n00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:47,400\nI didn't think about it before the show,\nso I didn't attach a certificate to mine.\n\n183\n00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,700\nBut you can choose that if\nyou're going to use SSL.\n\n184\n00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:50,490\nI'll leave that off.\n\n185\n00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:56,460\nAll right, when I hit Create,\nit's gonna connect up to that server, and\n\n186\n00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:59,080\nthere we go, I'm connected and\nI see my buddy list.\n\n187\n00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:02,760\nI can see old John Doe right there,\nwho I'm connected, and\n\n188\n00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:06,390\nif I want to start chatting with him,\nI can.\n\n189\n00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:10,430\nNow the nice thing about this\nIs it's going through my server.\n\n190\n00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:12,010\nSo I now have control over it.\n\n191\n00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:15,230\nI can jump over to my server and\ngo back to messages and\n\n192\n00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:18,390\nI can say archive all messages.\n\n193\n00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:18,960\nAll right.\n\n194\n00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,470\nNow when we do that, we do need to\nstop the server and start it again for\n\n195\n00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:23,100\nthat to take effect.\n\n196\n00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:26,270\nBut it's going to keep\na record now of the messaging.\n\n197\n00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:29,750\nIf you are working for\nlike a government agency where you have to\n\n198\n00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:32,110\nkeep a record of this stuff,\nthis is a great system.\n\n199\n00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:37,240\nSo now everybody's chat is gonna\nbe passing through our server and\n\n200\n00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,470\na record of that will be made.\n\n201\n00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:43,540\nAll right, so I'm gone offline here\nbecause I restarted that service, and\n\n202\n00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:47,240\nif I just come and try and go available\nagain, it will try and reconnect.\n\n203\n00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:50,166\nIt'll reconnect on its own eventually but\nI'll just force it along.\n\n204\n00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:51,260\nThere we go.\n\n205\n00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:53,010\nI can see old John Doe's gone offline.\n\n206\n00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:54,210\nHe got kicked out too.\n\n207\n00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:57,210\nBut now we're up and I'm ready to go.\n\n208\n00:10:57,210 --> 00:10:59,560\nI'm ready to start messaging and\nchatting away.\n\n209\n00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:02,650\nLet me get John Doe back to active.\n\n210\n00:11:08,014 --> 00:11:10,140\nAnd then he'll be ready to rock too.\n\n211\n00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:12,560\nSo at this point, we're up,\n\n212\n00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:17,020\nwe're good, we're ready to communicate,\nand things are in business.\n\n213\n00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:19,348\nSo there we go.\n\n214\n00:11:19,348 --> 00:11:21,745\nAll right.\n\n215\n00:11:21,745 --> 00:11:23,540\nWhoops.\n\n216\n00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:24,990\nI will try and get myself available.\n\n217\n00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:25,760\nThere we go.\n\n218\n00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,460\nAll right.\n\n219\n00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:29,120\nSo now I can see John Doe has gone online.\n\n220\n00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,790\nAnd I can come in and I can open up a chat\nand I can say, things are going great.\n\n221\n00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:37,500\nThis is the sad part of the episode\nwhere I start to chat with myself, and\n\n222\n00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,680\nthen back here I can see he's\nalready received that message.\n\n223\n00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,970\nThings are going great.\n\n224\n00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:41,810\nAnd he can respond.\n\n225\n00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:42,310\nWonderful.\n\n226\n00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,600\nThere it is.\n\n227\n00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,190\nAnd see how in the chat input box here,\nit actually says Jabber.\n\n228\n00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:50,720\nThat's reminding me which server I'm on,\n\n229\n00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,830\nbecause I might have multiple\nmessaging clients attached over here.\n\n230\n00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:56,860\nAnd I need to know which\nI'm using to communicate.\n\n231\n00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:59,620\nIf you got an iPhone attached,\nyou might even see SMS there,\n\n232\n00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:01,840\nif you punched in a phone\nnumber as a destination.\n\n233\n00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,879\nSo you can see a couple\nof different things.\n\n234\n00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:08,420\nThere's a few other neat features\nwith this, that when you've got\n\n235\n00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:12,820\nthe messages client fired up, and\nsomebody you're chatting with is\n\n236\n00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:17,250\nalso running the messages client we get\nthis nice little video button up here.\n\n237\n00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:18,780\nYou can do video chats.\n\n238\n00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:21,450\nAnd I'm in a virtual machine\nthat doesn't have a camera, so\n\n239\n00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:24,480\nI can see share my screen with John Doe.\n\n240\n00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,730\nI don't see show my camera.\n\n241\n00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:29,620\nSo I can hit that share my screen,\nand now it's going to try and\n\n242\n00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:30,660\ncreate a screen share over here.\n\n243\n00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:34,220\nI'll see you know would you like\nto do that and I'll say Accept.\n\n244\n00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:38,110\nAnd now it's gonna connect up and\nthere we go.\n\n245\n00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:41,560\nNow I'm doing screen sharing\nthrough the messaging client.\n\n246\n00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:44,110\nRight?\nSo, I'm seeing the other side or\n\n247\n00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:48,288\nwe could do a video, so\nif you wanted to have a video chat.\n\n248\n00:12:48,288 --> 00:12:54,240\nIt does H.264 video encoding, and that's\na very common protocol that's out there on\n\n249\n00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:59,600\nthe Internet for encoding video, and that\ngives us high quality but low bandwidth.\n\n250\n00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,780\nH.264 is very efficient, and so\nit's going to encode the video,\n\n251\n00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:06,490\nchuck it across the Internet,\nand send it onto the other side.\n\n252\n00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:08,610\nSo, and you get voice also,\nit's not just video.\n\n253\n00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:12,140\nSo you can have voice and\nvideo chat that way, or\n\n254\n00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:16,000\nyou can just stick with the text chat\nif that's what you're going for.\n\n255\n00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,620\nSo you got a few different options\nabout how you wanna go on that.\n\n256\n00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:23,620\nSo, I'm just gonna end that screen share,\nand go back here.\n\n257\n00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:24,950\nAll right.\n\n258\n00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:27,360\nSo the messaging client very powerful.\n\n259\n00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,720\nNow that its in place and its running as\na server admin if I ever need to I can\n\n260\n00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:35,690\nalways take it offline if I want or\nit is being archived.\n\n261\n00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:39,170\nSo I'll have a record and I could come\nin here to my message archives, and\n\n262\n00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:41,210\nhere I can find my messages log.\n\n263\n00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:45,530\nAnd, oh I don't have access to it.\n\n264\n00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:47,580\nActually, can we view\nthat in the log screen?\n\n265\n00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:48,270\nI think we can.\n\n266\n00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:48,875\nLet's see.\n\n267\n00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:53,100\nMulti-user chatlog, there we go.\n\n268\n00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,320\nAnd I can come in here and\nI can start to look and\n\n269\n00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,470\nsee where we've got those chat messages.\n\n270\n00:13:57,470 --> 00:14:00,518\nAnd no, actually this is\nthe wrong log file, isn't it?\n\n271\n00:14:00,518 --> 00:14:01,452\nI'm sure it is.\n\n272\n00:14:01,452 --> 00:14:03,880\nYeah, so\nI'm not logged in as the administrator.\n\n273\n00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,500\nI'm logged in with one of\nmy directory accounts.\n\n274\n00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,510\nSo, I don't have access to it.\n\n275\n00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:10,640\nI can get to it from the shell though,\nthat would work just fine.\n\n276\n00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:11,810\nBut it stores that right there.\n\n277\n00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:14,580\nThere's that record of chat messages.\n\n278\n00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:16,560\nYou know, who said what to who.\n\n279\n00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,260\nAnd you've now got it in archive.\n\n280\n00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:20,040\nThe end users don't have access to this.\n\n281\n00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:23,880\nSo it's kind of protected even if they\ncompletely wipe out their client format,\n\n282\n00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:24,790\ntheir laptop, whatever.\n\n283\n00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:25,740\nIt doesn't matter.\n\n284\n00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,580\nThis is stored on the server.\n\n285\n00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:30,700\nSo, in a corporate environment,\nthat's a very useful thing.\n\n286\n00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,770\nThe other nice thing about\nrunning your own chat server.\n\n287\n00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:33,885\nIt's not connected to the Internet.\n\n288\n00:14:33,885 --> 00:14:36,470\nRight?\nThis is my own private chat server\n\n289\n00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:37,750\nin my company.\n\n290\n00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:40,010\nSo I don't have to worry about people\nchatting with their friends from\n\n291\n00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:44,092\nhigh school and doing things like that\nthat create a non-efficient workplace.\n\n292\n00:14:44,092 --> 00:14:45,380\nRight?\nNow we control\n\n293\n00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:47,420\nwho it is that they're\nable to communicate with.\n\n294\n00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:49,719\nSo there are many organizations our\nthere that take advantage of that.\n\n295\n00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:52,360\nAll right?\nBut even on a personal level,\n\n296\n00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,690\nyou can still use messages.\n\n297\n00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:54,560\nIt's great.\n\n298\n00:14:54,560 --> 00:15:00,060\nIt connects to anything that is Jabber\ncompatible, as well as AOL, Google.\n\n299\n00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:05,060\nIt does, who else did we see, iMessage\nobviously is probably the biggest one,\n\n300\n00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:06,220\nthe most important one.\n\n301\n00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:07,490\nEspecially if you have an iPhone.\n\n302\n00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:09,223\nThat's a real big benefit.\n\n303\n00:15:09,223 --> 00:15:10,410\nAll right.\n\n304\n00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:12,660\nSo, that's pretty much messaging.\n\n305\n00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:16,480\nWe just need to be aware of a few\nthings that you might see on the exam.\n\n306\n00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:21,080\nThe H.264 video conferencing is one\nthat almost always shows up because\n\n307\n00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:24,860\nit's a cool feature and not a lot people\nuse it if they just knew about it.\n\n308\n00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:26,910\nYou have things like Facetime.\n\n309\n00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:30,810\nFacetime is great if you're running a Mac,\nand the other person's running a Mac.\n\n310\n00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:36,820\nBut, the video chat here, the H.264 video\nchat, that's actually a part of Jabber.\n\n311\n00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:41,670\nAnd so the other person can be on\na Windows PC running Trillian or\n\n312\n00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:42,990\nsome other client.\n\n313\n00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:46,640\nAnd you can be on a Mac running Messages\nand you can actually do that video chat.\n\n314\n00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:50,390\nSo that's a pretty cool thing it kind of\nbreaks down the barriers that we have\n\n315\n00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:51,848\nwith integrating with other systems.\n\n316\n00:15:51,848 --> 00:15:56,080\nSo all right,\nwell not a whole lot there but\n\n317\n00:15:56,080 --> 00:16:01,275\nthat is the message messaging system and\nthe messaging services inside of a Mac OS.\n\n318\n00:16:01,275 --> 00:16:05,395\nIf you're reading the book, the book\nit goes on and repeats the process\n\n319\n00:16:05,395 --> 00:16:09,445\nof installing the account like five\ndifferent times for the different ones.\n\n320\n00:16:09,445 --> 00:16:10,835\nBut they really are all the same,\n\n321\n00:16:10,835 --> 00:16:14,160\nyou just add it in punch in your username,\nand your password.\n\n322\n00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:14,720\nAll right?\n\n323\n00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,000\nThat's really about it.\n\n324\n00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,420\nI will make one more\ncomment on SSL though.\n\n325\n00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:21,280\nIf you do enable SSL on your system,\n\n326\n00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:25,210\nyou need to trust the server\nthat issued the SSL certificate,\n\n327\n00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:27,880\notherwise you'll get a warning\nwhen connect your Jabber account.\n\n328\n00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:32,150\nAnd you can just choose to trust the\ncertificate at that point or you can push\n\n329\n00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:36,650\nthe certificate out in advance using\nsomething like the profile manager and\n\n330\n00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:37,520\nthen that won't happen.\n\n331\n00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,070\nSo there's ways to get around that,\n\n332\n00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:42,890\nbut just be aware if you're doing SSL that\nthe certificate does need to be trusted.\n\n333\n00:16:44,672 --> 00:16:47,600\nAll right, well that's a pretty good\nspot for us to wrap this one up.\n\n334\n00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,460\nI know it's a short episode, but\nthat's all we've got on Messages.\n\n335\n00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:53,060\nSo let me just remind\nyou guys if you have any\n\n336\n00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:56,980\nquestions on this you can always ask\nduring the show at itpro.tv/live.\n\n337\n00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:59,590\nYou'll see the chat box beneath the video.\n\n338\n00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:03,290\nIf you have questions after\nthe show use our Q&A forms.\n\n339\n00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:06,780\nYou'll see the link that says Q&A\nat the top of every page, hit it.\n\n340\n00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:09,940\nIt takes you into the forums you can post\nyour questions there and we monitor and\n\n341\n00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:11,025\nanswer whenever.\n\n342\n00:17:11,025 --> 00:17:14,160\n[LAUGH] All right,\nwell I hope you guys enjoyed the show.\n\n343\n00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,730\nI'll see you in the next episode.\n\n344\n00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:16,910\nDefinetly stay tuned for that.\n\n345\n00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:21,132\nSo signing out for ITProTV,\nI'm Don Pezet and I'll see you then.\n\n346\n00:17:21,132 --> 00:17:31,132\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:36,676\nAll right, good morning,\ngood afternoon, and good evening and\n\n5\n00:00:36,676 --> 00:00:38,886\nwelcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:38,886 --> 00:00:45,420\nI'm your host Don Pezet, back again with\nanother episode of Mac Integration Basics.\n\n7\n00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,940\nWe're getting kinda towards the end\nof the objectives on this one.\n\n8\n00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:54,380\nWe're on our second to last section\nwhich is on data backup, wait\n\n9\n00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:58,780\nlet me give you the official name of this\none, it is data management and backup.\n\n10\n00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:03,220\nSo we're gonna start talking about\nhow we move our data around and\n\n11\n00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:06,750\nthen we're gonna end talking about how we\ncan back up our information, so we don't\n\n12\n00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:09,990\nlose it in the event that we have a hard\ndrive failure or something like that.\n\n13\n00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:12,900\nSo definitely important\nstuff to take a look at.\n\n14\n00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:18,140\nOn the data management side,\nwhat they're really alluding to\n\n15\n00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:20,050\nwhen they say data management,\nyou think of all sorts of things.\n\n16\n00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:22,080\nLike how do I limit my data and\nso forth but\n\n17\n00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:27,540\nwhat they're really alluding to is if\nyou currently have a Windows computer,\n\n18\n00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:32,330\nand you want to start using a Mac instead,\nyou've gotta have some way to\n\n19\n00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:36,620\nget your data off that Windows machine and\nbring it over to your Mac.\n\n20\n00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:38,970\nThere's a number of different\nways to go about that.\n\n21\n00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:42,050\nThere's tons of third party software\nout there that'll do it but\n\n22\n00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:45,500\nwe actually have a solution right\nfrom Apple that makes it pretty easy.\n\n23\n00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:50,250\nSo if you're trying to make that\ntransition from Windows to Mac,\n\n24\n00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:51,990\nwe've got options.\n\n25\n00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:55,855\nNow, we're gonna talk in the next\nsection about how we do what's called\n\n26\n00:01:55,855 --> 00:01:57,959\ncross-platform compatibility,\ntalking about\n\n27\n00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:03,560\nsoftware under Windows that you depend on\nand you need it to work under Mac OS also.\n\n28\n00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:07,590\nSo there's a whole different can of worms,\nand we'll see that in the next episode but\n\n29\n00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:10,510\nfor this episode,\nlet's just focus on our data.\n\n30\n00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:13,350\nI need to get my data off\nof that old computer and\n\n31\n00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:18,220\nbrought over to my new computer,\nwhat kind of data am I talking about?\n\n32\n00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:23,730\nI've got a Windows machine right here and\nwe can take a look at some of the stuff.\n\n33\n00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:28,430\nWe might have things like our custom\nwallpaper, our favorite wallpaper.\n\n34\n00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:29,490\nI've got to have that, right?\n\n35\n00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:32,310\nSo if I go to my new Mac,\nit's gotta have this wallpaper.\n\n36\n00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:35,520\nI might have things like\nInternet Explorer favorites,\n\n37\n00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:40,590\nbookmarks in my web browser and\nSafari is a very popular browser\n\n38\n00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:45,370\non MacOS because it comes with it but\nthere is a Windows version of Safari.\n\n39\n00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:46,610\nIt's not being updated anymore,\n\n40\n00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:50,950\nit was never very popular, so the odds\nare you're not using that same browser.\n\n41\n00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:55,160\nIf we have things like our favorites,\nso I've got Ingadget and Slashdot and\n\n42\n00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,830\nother websites listed here,\nthese are my favorites,\n\n43\n00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:00,800\nI wanna have those over on my Mac.\n\n44\n00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,400\nI might have documents, so\nif I go into my documents here,\n\n45\n00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,449\nstuff that I might've saved, let me\njust whip something up here real quick.\n\n46\n00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:14,703\nSo maybe this is my Christmas\n\n47\n00:03:14,703 --> 00:03:18,680\nwish list, here's everything\nthat I want for Christmas.\n\n48\n00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:24,380\nThese documents that I build,\nmy pictures, there's my wallpaper.\n\n49\n00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:26,530\nSo my pictures that I've\nsaved up over the years,\n\n50\n00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:31,500\nI want to bring those over to the Mac,\nthen other things like software settings.\n\n51\n00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,330\nI've got my email client right here.\n\n52\n00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:37,510\nSo it's logged into my email account and\nI've got some emails from Ronnie and\n\n53\n00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:41,410\nChristopher Watkin and so on,\nI want to bring those over.\n\n54\n00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:44,330\nMy contacts, stuff like that right.\n\n55\n00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:47,650\nSo how can I easily get all of this\nmoved over to the other system?\n\n56\n00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:48,562\nWe could do it piece meal.\n\n57\n00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:54,200\nI could copy this stuff to USB drive,\nbring it over one by one, or\n\n58\n00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,480\nI can use the Mac migration assistant.\n\n59\n00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,840\nSo Apple has a utility called\nthe migration assistant and\n\n60\n00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,030\nthere's two different versions of it.\n\n61\n00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:03,990\nThere's one that runs on Mac,\nand one that runs on Windows.\n\n62\n00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:09,690\nSo what you do is you is basically\nfire up the migration assistant\n\n63\n00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:14,220\non Windows and\nyou fire it up on your brand new Mac.\n\n64\n00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:17,930\nThey'll see each other over\nthe network and you can quickly and\n\n65\n00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:19,860\neasily transfer the data between the two.\n\n66\n00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:21,090\nIt makes life really easy.\n\n67\n00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:24,020\nYou can do the same thing\nbetween two Macs, if you want.\n\n68\n00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:26,960\nYou just run the Mac migration\nsystem on both of them.\n\n69\n00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,940\nSo easy enough to move them there but\n\n70\n00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:32,020\nwhat you're going to see on\nthe exam is Windows to Mac.\n\n71\n00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:37,890\nThere are a few things we need to be\naware of before we start this process.\n\n72\n00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:42,660\nThing number one is, while on the Mac,\nthe migration assistant is included,\n\n73\n00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:43,830\non Windows, it isn't.\n\n74\n00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:47,990\nMicrosoft is not gonna package the Mac\nmigration assistant with their OS.\n\n75\n00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:49,826\nThey're crazy but they're not that crazy.\n\n76\n00:04:49,826 --> 00:04:53,120\nSo, you're gonna have to go out and\ndownload it.\n\n77\n00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,050\nIn the book, is the actual URL for\nwhere you can go download it and\n\n78\n00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:59,820\nI'll post it with the show notes so you'll\nhave that URL but to be honest with you,\n\n79\n00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:04,270\nI always just go and hit Google and\ndo a search for Mac migration assistant.\n\n80\n00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:07,280\nSo you can just search for that and\n\n81\n00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,460\nit will come up in the first\ncouple of links here.\n\n82\n00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:12,950\nYou've got the Migration Assistant\nfrom Apple Support and\n\n83\n00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:16,710\nI'll click on that link, and\nhere it tells me all about it.\n\n84\n00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:20,210\nTells me what it does, how it works,\nwhat we can do with it, and\n\n85\n00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:24,050\nthen it'll have a link right here to\nuse the Windows Migration Assistant\n\n86\n00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:29,340\nand when we link to that,\nit's got the link to download it.\n\n87\n00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:33,280\nSo on the PC, download the Windows\nMigration Assistant installer, from\n\n88\n00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:37,110\nApple support downloads and we can browse\nthat link and download it right there.\n\n89\n00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:40,210\nSo it's all right on Apple's website,\nyou can go and download it.\n\n90\n00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:43,120\nEven if you already have a copy,\nI do encourage to go and\n\n91\n00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,890\ndownload it from the site because\nApple pushes out updates.\n\n92\n00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:47,260\nThis is version 1.0.5.6.\n\n93\n00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:51,380\nWith each version that comes out,\nthey add support for\n\n94\n00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:53,830\nnew software and\nthey make it a little bit more reliable.\n\n95\n00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:59,420\nThat leads me to my second caveat,\nwhich is not gonna show up on the exam but\n\n96\n00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:01,675\nthe migration assistant\nis not very reliable.\n\n97\n00:06:01,675 --> 00:06:06,860\n[LAUGH] The problem is,\neverybody uses their computers\n\n98\n00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:11,050\ndifferently and people have their\ninformation stored in different ways, so\n\n99\n00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:14,500\nthe migration assistant has really\ngot its work cut out for it.\n\n100\n00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,110\nIt's trying to back up your data but\n\n101\n00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:19,220\nit doesn't necessarily know\nhow you store your data.\n\n102\n00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:23,100\nSo it does a pretty good job of\ngetting your information but\n\n103\n00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:26,820\nthere's some things where it\njust isn't quite perfect.\n\n104\n00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:31,170\nIf I go back to that Apple article here,\nthe one explaining how\n\n105\n00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:33,440\nthe Migration Assistant works,\nsee how it's got this link.\n\n106\n00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,580\nWhat gets transferred and to where?\n\n107\n00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:40,900\nBasically, they have a table that we can\nview and it shows what gets backed up.\n\n108\n00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:44,640\nSo my machine that I've got over\nhere is a Windows 7 machine and\n\n109\n00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,920\nit's showing the things\nthat are getting backed up.\n\n110\n00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:50,090\nSee how it says it will back\nup from Microsoft Outlook?\n\n111\n00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:54,800\nWell, on the exam, you need to understand\nthat Microsoft Outlook is supported,\n\n112\n00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,250\nthat you can back that up but\nin real life, I have never once,\n\n113\n00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:03,990\nnot one single time, gotten the migration\nassistant to actually backup Outlook data.\n\n114\n00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:07,200\nIt just doesn't happen,\nI don't know why that is.\n\n115\n00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,450\nSome quirk in the software,\n\n116\n00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:11,620\na quirk with the server setup,\nI'm not sure, it just doesn't work.\n\n117\n00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:14,850\nThe Windows Live Mail and Windows Mail\non the other hand, those work for\n\n118\n00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:16,000\nme every time.\n\n119\n00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,355\nSo some of this stuff is very consistent,\nsome isn't.\n\n120\n00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:21,880\nWhat I'm trying to drive home is not\nthat the migration assistant is bad.\n\n121\n00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,810\nIt's a good product.\n\n122\n00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:25,130\nYou should use it but always double check.\n\n123\n00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:29,010\nDouble check to make sure that everything\ntransferred over that you wanted to\n\n124\n00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:32,320\nbecause you might have to go behind and\ncatch some things that got missed.\n\n125\n00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,730\nThe nice thing about this is when\nyou run the migration assistant,\n\n126\n00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:37,390\nit doesn't make any changes\nto the source machine.\n\n127\n00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:40,189\nYour Windows machine is left alone and\nthen it copies data\n\n128\n00:07:40,189 --> 00:07:44,034\nover to the new machine, to your Mac, so\nif anything was left out, you can just\n\n129\n00:07:44,034 --> 00:07:47,677\njump right back over to your Windows\nmachine and grab it and bring it over.\n\n130\n00:07:47,677 --> 00:07:52,033\nJust be aware that's it's not infallible,\nit can make some mistakes but\n\n131\n00:07:52,033 --> 00:07:56,175\nit does try to back up your email\nsettings, it tries to get your email,\n\n132\n00:07:56,175 --> 00:07:59,502\nyour POP3 configuration or\nyour iMap configuration.\n\n133\n00:07:59,502 --> 00:08:02,459\nIf you're connected to\nan Exchange server using Outlook,\n\n134\n00:08:02,459 --> 00:08:05,840\nit will actually get your Calendar,\nand your Contacts, and so on.\n\n135\n00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,370\nIf you're using Windows Live Mail,\nif can't get the Calendar.\n\n136\n00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:12,130\nSee, how under Windows Live Mail here for\nContacts,\n\n137\n00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:13,770\nit doesn't have that checked off.\n\n138\n00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:15,790\nAnd for Calendar,\nit doesn't have it checked off, so\n\n139\n00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:17,060\nit's not gonna get that data.\n\n140\n00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:25,520\nSo, If I take a look at my email again,\nI'll see that I have Calendar entries,\n\n141\n00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,800\nbut they're not gonna come over cuz it's\nnot supported from Windows Live Mail.\n\n142\n00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,620\nSo, if I can manage to get\nin my account over there.\n\n143\n00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:34,190\nSo, I've got some Mac Management\nbasic stuff in there.\n\n144\n00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:36,320\nAnd that's not gonna come over.\n\n145\n00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:41,570\nSo, just be aware that there\nare limitations to what it can grab.\n\n146\n00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:43,720\nOnce we go to the website,\nand download it, though.\n\n147\n00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:46,940\nIt's just this little package right\nhere that we download to our system, and\n\n148\n00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:47,680\nwe can install it.\n\n149\n00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,070\nThe installer's really straightforward.\n\n150\n00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:52,100\nYou just, basically,\nclick Next a few times.\n\n151\n00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:52,920\nEmail's upset with me.\n\n152\n00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:53,790\nLet me get rid of that.\n\n153\n00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:54,765\nThere we go.\n\n154\n00:08:54,765 --> 00:08:59,010\nSo, I'm just gonna run through this\nlittle installer real quick, and\n\n155\n00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:00,648\nwe'll install the software.\n\n156\n00:09:00,648 --> 00:09:04,520\nI'm not gonna change any defaults, I'm\njust accepting the license agreement, and\n\n157\n00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,360\nthen we'll let it install.\n\n158\n00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:10,130\nNow, when the software is installed,\nit's not actually doing anything.\n\n159\n00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:12,110\nWe need to run it, to get it working.\n\n160\n00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:18,341\nAnd when you run it,\nhere's that Windows Migration Assistant,\n\n161\n00:09:18,341 --> 00:09:21,848\nit seems to think that\nI'm already running it.\n\n162\n00:09:21,848 --> 00:09:25,265\n[LAUGH] But I'm pretty sure I'm not.\n\n163\n00:09:27,181 --> 00:09:28,670\nLet's see what's going on here.\n\n164\n00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:29,460\nThere it is.\n\n165\n00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:31,510\nI guess, it already launched on its own.\n\n166\n00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:34,390\nSo, it's warning me that I've got\nWindows Live Mail running right now.\n\n167\n00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:37,580\nAnd the Migration Assistant can't work\nwhile Windows Mail is running, so,\n\n168\n00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:39,110\nI'm just gonna go, and close that.\n\n169\n00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:45,267\nAnd it may, or may not detect it, but\nI'm impatient, so I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n170\n00:09:45,267 --> 00:09:46,720\nhit Quit, and I'll just re-launch it.\n\n171\n00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:50,930\nSo, I'll fire up that\nWindows Migration System again.\n\n172\n00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:51,930\nThere we go.\n\n173\n00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:53,530\nStill saying I've got the email open.\n\n174\n00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:57,730\nSee, this is the glory of trying\nto get stuff, to run on Windows.\n\n175\n00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:59,380\nLet me just make sure it actually closed.\n\n176\n00:10:01,973 --> 00:10:05,574\nSo, I'm just gonna double-check\nthat real quick, and\n\n177\n00:10:05,574 --> 00:10:09,932\nmake sure I don't see the Live Mail\nin my Task Manager, and I don't.\n\n178\n00:10:09,932 --> 00:10:11,682\nGood.\nLet's try this again.\n\n179\n00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:17,334\nIf it still complains about having\nsoftware opened, mine got over it, but\n\n180\n00:10:17,334 --> 00:10:18,348\nif it still complains,\n\n181\n00:10:18,348 --> 00:10:21,305\nan easy way to get around that is\nto just quickly reboot the machine.\n\n182\n00:10:21,305 --> 00:10:23,325\nIf you reboot that'll make sure\nall the software's closed, and\n\n183\n00:10:23,325 --> 00:10:23,895\nyou don't have a problem.\n\n184\n00:10:23,895 --> 00:10:25,685\nBut here it is, it's running.\n\n185\n00:10:25,685 --> 00:10:29,835\nNow, on the PC side,\nthere's really not much we do.\n\n186\n00:10:29,835 --> 00:10:33,895\nWe run the Assistant, we hit Continue,\nit tells us what it's about to do.\n\n187\n00:10:33,895 --> 00:10:39,230\nSo, we hit Continue again, and\nthen it's gonna sit, and wait.\n\n188\n00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:42,860\nAnd what it's doing is it's\nusing the Bonjour protocol, and\n\n189\n00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:44,540\nadvertising out on the network.\n\n190\n00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:46,180\nIt's saying hey,\nI'm a Windows machine, and\n\n191\n00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:50,390\nI'm running the Migration Assistant, is\nthere anybody out there, I can migrate to?\n\n192\n00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:52,260\nAnd It's just gonna sit here, like this.\n\n193\n00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:53,392\nAnd that's what we wanna do.\n\n194\n00:10:53,392 --> 00:10:56,640\nWe wanna leave it right there,\nand just let it sit.\n\n195\n00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:02,750\nAnd then we can jump over to our brand\nnew Mac, where is my brand new Mac here.\n\n196\n00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:06,160\nSo, here I am on this brand new Mac,\nand when I set it up,\n\n197\n00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,850\nI just create an account called Help Desk.\n\n198\n00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:09,770\nSo, I have a user account\nhere called Help Desk.\n\n199\n00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:11,860\nAnd that's what I've logged in as,\nbut that's it,\n\n200\n00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:16,750\nif I go into my System Preferences,\nand into my Users, and Groups.\n\n201\n00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:20,720\nI can see that, I don't have\na user account called Don Pezet.\n\n202\n00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,030\nI'm not bound to any directory service,\nor whatever.\n\n203\n00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:25,780\nSo, the only account that's\non the system is Help Desk.\n\n204\n00:11:27,525 --> 00:11:30,525\nWell, now I'm gonna run\nthe Migration Assistant here, and\n\n205\n00:11:30,525 --> 00:11:33,125\nit's gonna find that PC on the network.\n\n206\n00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:36,855\nAnd we're gonna be able to bring all\nthat data over, and when it does it.\n\n207\n00:11:36,855 --> 00:11:40,050\nIt's gonna create that Don Pezet user for\nme.\n\n208\n00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:41,720\nAnd I can set a password.\n\n209\n00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,120\nIt can't import the password.\n\n210\n00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,670\nThere's no way to decrypt\nthe password from Windows.\n\n211\n00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:49,973\nSo, we'll reset the password, and\nit will import those settings.\n\n212\n00:11:49,973 --> 00:11:55,140\nSo I'm gonna go in here, and\nI'll just punch in Migration Assistant.\n\n213\n00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:02,856\nAnd I use Spotlight, and just typed\nin Migration there to find it, but\n\n214\n00:12:02,856 --> 00:12:05,610\nif you wanna know where it\nactually is on the hard drive.\n\n215\n00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:07,200\nIt's in the Applications folder, and\n\n216\n00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,250\nthen inside of there it's\nin the Utilities folder.\n\n217\n00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:11,310\nSo, the Migration Assistant\nis sitting right there.\n\n218\n00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:13,910\nI'm gonna go ahead, and hit Continue.\n\n219\n00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:15,230\nAnd you do have to be an Administrator,\n\n220\n00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:18,670\nso I'll unlock you with my\nadministrative account.\n\n221\n00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:20,580\nAnd then it's gonna launch\nthe Migration Assistant.\n\n222\n00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:25,020\nAnd when the Migration Assistant launches,\nit's asking where my data is coming from.\n\n223\n00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:30,720\nAm I pulling it from a Mac, from a Windows\nPC, or am I sending to another Mac?\n\n224\n00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,050\nRemember, when I said if\nI was going Mac to Mac,\n\n225\n00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:35,510\nyou just run the Migration Assistant\non both of them?\n\n226\n00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:39,370\nOn one you would say, to another Mac,\non the other you would say, from a Mac.\n\n227\n00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:41,380\nThat's how you do Mac to Mac.\n\n228\n00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:43,740\nBut we wanna do it from a Windows PC.\n\n229\n00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:48,130\nThere's a Windows PC out there somewhere,\nand I wanna get my data.\n\n230\n00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:50,430\nSo, I'll hit Data, and I'll hit Continue.\n\n231\n00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:52,280\nNow, it's gonna search the network for\n\n232\n00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:58,160\nanybody running the Windows Migration\nAssistant, and it found WIN-CLIENT1.\n\n233\n00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,180\nThat's my machine.\n\n234\n00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:01,050\nYou might see two, three, eight machines,\n\n235\n00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:03,060\nif you're running this\non multiple machines.\n\n236\n00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:05,120\nSo, you would pick the appropriate one.\n\n237\n00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,240\nSo, I'm picking that one.\n\n238\n00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,508\nIt's still scanning for others that might\nbe out there, so I'm gonna pick it.\n\n239\n00:13:10,508 --> 00:13:13,910\nNow, another caveat,\nit's using bonjour to do this, and\n\n240\n00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:16,410\nthat means that it's using broadcasts.\n\n241\n00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:21,750\nAnd it expects the Windows machine, and\nthe Mac machine to be on the same network.\n\n242\n00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,820\nSo, if you're connected to\nthe same wireless network,\n\n243\n00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:26,900\nor physically plugged into the same\nnetwork, you'll find each other.\n\n244\n00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:30,420\nBut if you're plugged into two different\nnetworks, you won't find each other, and\n\n245\n00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:32,730\nthen it's not going to work out so well.\n\n246\n00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:33,940\nSo, we need to be on the same network.\n\n247\n00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:36,010\nIn my case they are, so it finds it.\n\n248\n00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:36,790\nAnd I can hit Continue.\n\n249\n00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:39,190\nNow, here's a really important part.\n\n250\n00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:42,400\nThis is a broadcast technology, so\n\n251\n00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:46,000\nan attacker in theory could\nfire up their own software.\n\n252\n00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,960\nAnd connect to your system, and\ndownload your account, and all your data.\n\n253\n00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,285\nAnd you don't want that.\n\n254\n00:13:50,285 --> 00:13:54,125\nSo, before it'll work,\non the Mac it displays a code.\n\n255\n00:13:54,125 --> 00:14:01,635\nMine is 932716, and then on your PC it\nshould be displaying the same code.\n\n256\n00:14:01,635 --> 00:14:04,410\nIf an attacker has connected,\nthe code won't match.\n\n257\n00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:09,510\nOnly if the code matches, do hit Continue?\n\n258\n00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:11,810\nAnd if we hit Continue, now,\n\n259\n00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:16,840\nthe PC is gonna tell the Mac, here's\nall the stuff I have, what do you want?\n\n260\n00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:21,110\nAnd so back on the Mac, I get a screen,\nwhere I get to pick what I want.\n\n261\n00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,800\nHere's my user account, Don Pezet.\n\n262\n00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,420\nI'll go ahead, and bring that over.\n\n263\n00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:27,410\nAnd notice my icon,\nI can't even tell what that is.\n\n264\n00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:29,220\nA number one, or something?\n\n265\n00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:31,830\nSo, there's my icon,\nit's gonna bring that over.\n\n266\n00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:35,370\nMy Music, Pictures, Movies,\nDesktop, Downloads.\n\n267\n00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:39,450\nI can go through, and pick, and\nchoose what I want to bring over.\n\n268\n00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:44,110\nAnd here it's getting my Mail account,\nany email messages that I've got.\n\n269\n00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:47,620\nContacts, Bookmarks,\nOther Settings, so you can\n\n270\n00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:50,600\nturn any of this stuff off if you want,\nbut you pick, and choose what you want.\n\n271\n00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,280\nAnd then you hit Continue.\n\n272\n00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:55,950\nNow, it's copying that data over.\n\n273\n00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:58,670\nIf you have a lot of data,\nthis can take a long time.\n\n274\n00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:00,200\nIt's copying over the network.\n\n275\n00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,710\nMy account's almost empty.\n\n276\n00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:04,940\nBookmarks, and simple things like\nthat don't take a lot of space, so\n\n277\n00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:06,060\nmine will happen pretty quick.\n\n278\n00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:13,270\nWhen it's done, you can hit Quit,\nand your Mac will log out.\n\n279\n00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:17,220\nAnd now, you can log in with\nyour brand new shiny user.\n\n280\n00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:21,540\nSo, it created a user called Don Pezet, it\nimported my icon from that other machine.\n\n281\n00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:25,870\nAnd so, I can click on that,\nand I don't have a password.\n\n282\n00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:30,720\nIt wasn't able to bring the password over,\nso I do need to punch in a new password.\n\n283\n00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,640\nSo, I'll go ahead, and do that.\n\n284\n00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,650\nAnd then it's going to log in.\n\n285\n00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:37,840\nNow, it tried to bring over as\nmany settings as it could, but\n\n286\n00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:40,740\nI need to double-check, and make sure\nthat it brought over my stuff, so\n\n287\n00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,020\nI can be ready to rock.\n\n288\n00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:46,016\nSo, as soon as it gets logged in, well,\nit's gonna ask me about an Apple ID.\n\n289\n00:15:46,016 --> 00:15:47,265\nI'm gonna say, don't sign in.\n\n290\n00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:53,720\nAnd then it's gonna log me in,\nand I'll see my desktop.\n\n291\n00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,591\nAnd from there,\nI can start to double-check things.\n\n292\n00:15:56,591 --> 00:16:00,248\nNow, it didn't bring my wallpaper over,\nsometimes it does,\n\n293\n00:16:00,248 --> 00:16:04,251\nsometimes it doesn't, in my case\nit didn't So I lost my wallpaper.\n\n294\n00:16:04,251 --> 00:16:07,997\nWell, I'm not too worried about that cuz\nmy wallpaper was saved in my pictures\n\n295\n00:16:07,997 --> 00:16:10,610\nfolder, and\nit should have brought that over.\n\n296\n00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:11,590\nSo, I'm gonna double-check that.\n\n297\n00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:14,050\nI'm just going to go up here to Go,\nand Home.\n\n298\n00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:18,220\nAnd I'll start to take a look\ninto some of my files here.\n\n299\n00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:21,600\nSo if I go into pictures,\nwell, there's my picture,\n\n300\n00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,190\nthat beach resort picture that I had.\n\n301\n00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:28,510\nSo I can always reassign that as my\ndesktop picture here in a moment.\n\n302\n00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:32,240\nI can also go in to Documents, and\nthere's my Christmas Wish List.\n\n303\n00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,970\nSo that came over too, so I've got that.\n\n304\n00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:36,620\nI'll get all the presents that I want.\n\n305\n00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:38,200\nSo I got that data.\n\n306\n00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,450\nWhat else do we bring over?\n\n307\n00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:41,520\nOur bookmarks, right?\n\n308\n00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,660\nI'm gonna fire up Safari.\n\n309\n00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:47,140\nAnd if I go into Safari, I now\n\n310\n00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:52,308\nhave a new folder in my Favorites here\ncalled Migrated from Internet Explorer.\n\n311\n00:16:52,308 --> 00:16:55,242\nOr if you go up here, it's a little easier\nto see, Migrated from Internet Explorer.\n\n312\n00:16:55,242 --> 00:16:58,140\nAnd there's Engadget, Google, Slashdot, so\n\n313\n00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:02,070\nI can fire up Slashdot, and\njump right in there and see stuff.\n\n314\n00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:07,756\nSo, I can try if I ever\nget out there [LAUGH].\n\n315\n00:17:07,756 --> 00:17:10,530\nAll right,\nmaybe I'll try Engadget instead.\n\n316\n00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:13,210\nLet's find out if something works,\nthere we go.\n\n317\n00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:14,550\nSo I can get out there and\n\n318\n00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:17,120\nbrowse the Internet with all\nof my favorites, all right?\n\n319\n00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,770\nSo that came over, what else did we bring?\n\n320\n00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:22,090\nOh, email, email was the other one, right?\n\n321\n00:17:22,090 --> 00:17:26,360\nSo if I got into my email client,\nso I'll fire up my mail.\n\n322\n00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:31,610\nAnd when I launch that, sure enough,\nI can see I've got an email client.\n\n323\n00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:34,834\nI've got some emails that came in,\nso there's an email from Ronnie and\n\n324\n00:17:34,834 --> 00:17:35,865\nChristopher Walken.\n\n325\n00:17:35,865 --> 00:17:39,347\nAnd if I go up to my mail and accounts.\n\n326\n00:17:42,784 --> 00:17:44,400\nI can see that it did set me up.\n\n327\n00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,070\nIt actually kinda doubled it up,\ndidn't it?\n\n328\n00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:51,550\nSo I've got one for lab.itpro.tv.\n\n329\n00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:55,260\nThat's my POP3 account that I had which,\napparently,\n\n330\n00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:58,000\nit didn't bring the password over for,\nso I'll just punch that in.\n\n331\n00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:01,260\nOh, you know what, I've got that\nserver turned off right now, so\n\n332\n00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:02,380\nit's not able to connect to the server.\n\n333\n00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:03,580\nThat's why it's prompting.\n\n334\n00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:06,980\nAnd the next one, lab.itprotv here,\nthis one is for notes.\n\n335\n00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:09,300\nSo one for mail, one for notes.\n\n336\n00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:14,000\nNotice it didn't bring in anything for\ncalendar, or contacts, or whatever.\n\n337\n00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,030\nAnd that was cuz I was\nusing Windows Live Mail,\n\n338\n00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:18,840\nwhich it just gets the email portion of.\n\n339\n00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:21,240\nBut it did try to bring\nover whatever it could.\n\n340\n00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:25,611\nSo it's got that, and\nwe're ready to rock, all right?\n\n341\n00:18:25,611 --> 00:18:28,854\nSo the Mac Migration Assistant,\nyou guys see it.\n\n342\n00:18:28,854 --> 00:18:30,060\nIt's decent.\n\n343\n00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:31,500\nIt's got its shortcomings.\n\n344\n00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,195\nIt works fairly well, though.\n\n345\n00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:35,770\nIt's definitely quick and\neasy for moving files,\n\n346\n00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:38,450\nbecause the two machines just\nhave to be on the same network.\n\n347\n00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:41,730\nBonjour takes care of the rest and\nyou can transfer it.\n\n348\n00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:45,880\nSo that's an effective way to get\nour Windows systems moved over.\n\n349\n00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,580\nLet's see.\nWhat are some other things?\n\n350\n00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:52,770\nLet's see, what else do we need\nto be aware of on that one?\n\n351\n00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:55,010\nI think that's basically it.\n\n352\n00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:58,140\nThere is third party software that's\nout there that you can use, but\n\n353\n00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:59,770\nyou're not gonna see that on the exam.\n\n354\n00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:02,260\nOn the exam,\nyou'll see the Migration Assistant.\n\n355\n00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:05,900\nAnd on the exam, they really focus\non the Windows to Mac side, but\n\n356\n00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:08,700\njust be aware that you can use this for\nMac to Mac also.\n\n357\n00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,590\nThe Migration Assistant works there.\n\n358\n00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:12,570\nIt's a heck of a lot more reliable,\nMac to Mac,\n\n359\n00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:15,490\nand that's because Apple\ncontrols all that software.\n\n360\n00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:19,330\nOn the Windows side, you know Apple\ncan build in perfect support,\n\n361\n00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:21,320\nand then Microsoft changes something.\n\n362\n00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:23,300\nAnd now it's broken,\nnow they've gotta fix it.\n\n363\n00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:26,050\nAnd that's where I go back to saying,\nit's so important to go and\n\n364\n00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:29,510\ndownload the latest version of the\nMigration Assistant to run on your Windows\n\n365\n00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:33,620\nbox, cuz otherwise, it will get out of\ndate and then you're gonna have problems.\n\n366\n00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:40,260\nAll right, well that's pretty much it for\nthe data management piece, right?\n\n367\n00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:43,620\nJust migrating that data from Windows\nto a Mac, pretty straightforward.\n\n368\n00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:46,140\nThere are other options that\nthey call out in the book,\n\n369\n00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:50,270\nthey're kinda low tech,\ncopying files to external storage, right?\n\n370\n00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:52,770\nIf I don't wanna mess around\nwith a Migration Assistant,\n\n371\n00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:56,090\nthen what I can do is I can take\nsomething, like an external hard drive.\n\n372\n00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:59,180\nThis is a USB 3.0 hard\ndrive that I tote around.\n\n373\n00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:00,945\nI've got a Thunderbolt one also.\n\n374\n00:20:00,945 --> 00:20:03,720\nBut, you might say why don't\nyou use the Thunderbolt one?\n\n375\n00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,370\nThat one's awesome.\n\n376\n00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:09,360\nAnd the reason is, Apple's really the only\ncompany that is supporting thunderbolt in\n\n377\n00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,160\nany great number right now.\n\n378\n00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,570\nSo if you get an Apple machine,\n\n379\n00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:16,040\nyeah, you're gonna have those Thunderbolt\nports, but when you go to a Windows PC,\n\n380\n00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:19,080\nI've never seen a Windows PC\nwith a Thunderbolt port.\n\n381\n00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,440\nIt doesn't mean they're not out there.\n\n382\n00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,890\nI've just never seen one.\n\n383\n00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:26,320\nUSB 3.0, on the other hand,\nworks on Windows, works on Mac.\n\n384\n00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,760\nSo you can take an external drive\nlike this, plug it into your PC,\n\n385\n00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:35,860\ncopy your data to it, and then take it\nover to your Mac, and transfer it there.\n\n386\n00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:38,050\nSome of the things to worry\nabout with this method.\n\n387\n00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:40,920\nFirst off, it's up to you to make\nsure you get the right data.\n\n388\n00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:47,220\nSecond, you've got to use a file system\nthat's compatible between the two OS's.\n\n389\n00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:49,260\nIf I connect this to a Windows machine and\n\n390\n00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:53,800\nI allow Windows to format it,\nit's going to format it as NTFS.\n\n391\n00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:57,380\nThat's the Windows NT file\nsystem that Microsoft uses.\n\n392\n00:20:57,380 --> 00:21:03,080\nMac OS has support for\nNTFS, but read-only.\n\n393\n00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:07,210\nSo your Mac can read NTFS,\nbut it can't write to it.\n\n394\n00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:10,310\nSo if you're just transferring data\nfrom Windows to Mac, that's fine.\n\n395\n00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:14,340\nYou can format this NTFS, copy your\ndata to it, throw it on your Mac, and\n\n396\n00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:16,766\ncopy it in to your Mac, all right?\n\n397\n00:21:16,766 --> 00:21:21,030\nBut if you want to move data back and\nforth, between a Windows and\n\n398\n00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:25,610\na Mac machine, this won't work, because\nyour Mac won't be able to write to it.\n\n399\n00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:29,820\nSo we need to format it in a way\nthat's compatible with both systems.\n\n400\n00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:34,606\nWell, you'll see a lot of websites, and\nI think they even mention it in the book\n\n401\n00:21:34,606 --> 00:21:39,552\nsomewhere, that you can format the hard\ndrive with FAT, File Allocation Table.\n\n402\n00:21:39,552 --> 00:21:45,660\nThe problem with FAT is it doesn't\nsupport files over two gigabytes in size.\n\n403\n00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:47,450\nAnd that used to not be a big deal, but\n\n404\n00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:52,090\ntoday, a lot of us deal with files\nover two gigs on a regular basis.\n\n405\n00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:58,460\nI have ISOs, DVD images that are over\ntwo gigs, videos, our episodes.\n\n406\n00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:02,060\nWhen we film an episode like this, the\noriginals are way over two gigs in size.\n\n407\n00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:04,930\nSo that's definitely something\nthat's gonna be a problem.\n\n408\n00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:07,950\nSo there's got to be a better\nmiddle ground, and there is.\n\n409\n00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:11,978\nThere's a file system called exFAT,\nE-X-FAT.\n\n410\n00:22:11,978 --> 00:22:15,360\nIt's Extended File Allocation Table.\n\n411\n00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:18,530\nAnd what it is,\nis it's still really based on FAT, but\n\n412\n00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:21,620\nit supports files over 2 gigs in size.\n\n413\n00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:23,860\nAnd if you format your drive with exFAT,\n\n414\n00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:25,840\nyou'll be able to move it\nbetween the two systems.\n\n415\n00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,730\nSo let me show you that process.\n\n416\n00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:30,243\nI'm going to plug this drive in.\n\n417\n00:22:32,414 --> 00:22:37,557\nAnd I'm going to try and\nplug this drive in, there we go.\n\n418\n00:22:37,557 --> 00:22:38,381\nAnd you know what?\n\n419\n00:22:38,381 --> 00:22:41,153\nI'll just use my actual desktop here,\n\n420\n00:22:41,153 --> 00:22:44,690\ninstead of using my virtual\nmachines on this one.\n\n421\n00:22:46,562 --> 00:22:49,770\nAll right, so I just plugged that\nhard drive in and I've got it,\n\n422\n00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:52,100\nhere it is, DPIZET_USB.\n\n423\n00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:54,631\nAnd I'm gonna go into my disk utility.\n\n424\n00:22:57,568 --> 00:22:59,280\nLet me just fire that up.\n\n425\n00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:03,637\nAnd I can see that DPEZET_USB\nhard drive right there.\n\n426\n00:23:03,637 --> 00:23:07,157\nNow if I click on it,\nI can see it's got this one little drive.\n\n427\n00:23:07,157 --> 00:23:10,735\nAnd I can look down here and I can see\nthat it is Windows NT File System,\n\n428\n00:23:10,735 --> 00:23:12,060\nit's NTFS.\n\n429\n00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:14,070\nSo right now it is NTFS.\n\n430\n00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:17,420\nI could hook it up to a Windows box,\ncopy data to it, and\n\n431\n00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:19,180\nthen send it over to a Mac.\n\n432\n00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:21,940\nBut the Mac won't be able to write to it.\n\n433\n00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:28,540\nSo if I want to write to it, what I need\nto do is I need to go to my Erase screen.\n\n434\n00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:33,050\nSo, in Disk Utility, I just clicked\non a disk, and I went to Erase, and\n\n435\n00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:36,470\nyou can drop down the box and\npick your file system.\n\n436\n00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:41,440\nIf you pick Mac OS, the extended\njournal file system, that's the one\n\n437\n00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:44,480\nthat's gonna be most reliable for\nyou, but it's not gonna work on a PC.\n\n438\n00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:50,310\nIf you choose FAT,\nthat'll work on both PC and Mac, but\n\n439\n00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:52,070\nyou can't store files over two gigs.\n\n440\n00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:53,255\nSo that's a problem.\n\n441\n00:23:53,255 --> 00:23:56,638\nBut if you choose exFAT,\nthat's that middle ground.\n\n442\n00:23:56,638 --> 00:23:58,558\nThat's the one that both work with.\n\n443\n00:23:58,558 --> 00:24:00,386\nAnd so I can hit Erase.\n\n444\n00:24:00,386 --> 00:24:05,599\nAnd now I'm gonna have a good stable\ndrive that I can move between systems,\n\n445\n00:24:05,599 --> 00:24:06,444\nall right.\n\n446\n00:24:06,444 --> 00:24:08,540\nNow, a little caveat with exFAT,\n\n447\n00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:13,700\nexFAT is a sensitive file system and\nI don't mean sensitive like emotionally.\n\n448\n00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:16,050\nI mean sensitive as far as data integrity.\n\n449\n00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:21,250\nIf you unplug this drive just by yanking\nthe cable out it can corrupt the drive so\n\n450\n00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:22,600\nyou have to be careful with that.\n\n451\n00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,177\nSo when you are using exFAT,\n\n452\n00:24:24,177 --> 00:24:28,265\nmake sure you properly eject the drive\nwhen you're not using it, right.\n\n453\n00:24:28,265 --> 00:24:32,149\nSo you need to make that\nanytime you are not using it,\n\n454\n00:24:32,149 --> 00:24:36,848\nproperly drag over it and eject it or\ncan use the finder to do it.\n\n455\n00:24:36,848 --> 00:24:40,350\nUse your eject button any time you\nare going to disconnect that drive.\n\n456\n00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:42,520\nSo that it doesn't get corrupted.\n\n457\n00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:47,473\nBut now I've got a drive that I can tote\nbetween my systems and pack my data up.\n\n458\n00:24:47,473 --> 00:24:48,515\nAll right.\n\n459\n00:24:48,515 --> 00:24:51,554\nThe last way they mention it in the book\nis probably the least practical which is\n\n460\n00:24:51,554 --> 00:24:53,090\nto email yourself the data.\n\n461\n00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:57,650\nThat you can log into your old computer,\ngather your data up, and\n\n462\n00:24:57,650 --> 00:24:59,780\nattach it to an email and\nemail it to yourself,\n\n463\n00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:03,280\nand then you can go to your new machine\nand just check the email and get it.\n\n464\n00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,860\nThere's two problems with that.\n\n465\n00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:08,370\nFirst off, most mail servers\nout there block attendance over\n\n466\n00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:11,650\nten megabytes in size, so\nit really needs to be something small, and\n\n467\n00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:15,290\nin the book they even say it should be\nless than five megabytes of data, so\n\n468\n00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:18,360\nif you have very little data that\nyou want to transfer, that works.\n\n469\n00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:21,580\nThe other problem is email\nis unencrypted by default,\n\n470\n00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:24,810\nso when you email your data,\nyou're putting your data at risk,\n\n471\n00:25:24,810 --> 00:25:27,680\nsomebody might be able to\ngain access to it in transit.\n\n472\n00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,470\nSo we wanna be careful with those options.\n\n473\n00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:31,460\nThey're not the most reliable.\n\n474\n00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:35,200\nRight?\nJust be careful with that one.\n\n475\n00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:35,710\nAll right.\nSo\n\n476\n00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:39,500\nthose are the ways that Apple recommends\nas far as moving our data between\n\n477\n00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:41,010\nthe systems.\n\n478\n00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:44,840\nOnce we get our data moved over to\nthe Mac now we're ready to rock, right.\n\n479\n00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:47,310\nWe turn off that Windows machine,\nnow we're on our Mac and\n\n480\n00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:51,020\nwe're in business we just run\nabout business as usual, right.\n\n481\n00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:55,760\nWell, the next thing we need to do is to\nmake sure that our Mac is being backed up.\n\n482\n00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,920\nSo that if something ever happens,\na hard drive failure or\n\n483\n00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:00,600\nwhatever, we can recover our data,\nall right.\n\n484\n00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:03,690\nAnd that's what we're going to take\na look at next, but, looking at the time,\n\n485\n00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:05,630\nthis is a good spot to stop and\ntake a break.\n\n486\n00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:07,080\nSo let's do that, we'll take a break,\n\n487\n00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:11,010\nand when we get back we're gonna look\nat backing up our data on a Mac.\n\n488\n00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:13,390\nSo stay tuned, we'll be back in a few.\n\n489\n00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:20,931\n[SOUND].\n\n490\n00:26:20,931 --> 00:26:22,800\nAll right welcome back everybody.\n\n491\n00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:27,556\nSo know we've got our data moved over\nto our Mac and we're all happy right?\n\n492\n00:26:27,556 --> 00:26:29,260\nNow we wanna stay happy.\n\n493\n00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:31,160\nThe problem is things happen, right,\n\n494\n00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:35,330\nthings happen that make our\ncomputers either lose data, fail, or\n\n495\n00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:38,150\nsomething happens where we're no\nlonger able to access our information.\n\n496\n00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:41,200\nSo we need a way to recover, and\nthis used to be something that we\n\n497\n00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:45,140\nreally struggled with just in\ngeneral backing up our systems.\n\n498\n00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:48,900\nWell several years ago Apple\nintroduced Time Machine.\n\n499\n00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:52,810\nAnd Time Machine is probably\none of the most singularly\n\n500\n00:26:52,810 --> 00:26:57,760\nawesome features inside of Mac OS\nbecause it makes backups so simple,\n\n501\n00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:01,800\nso easy, that we don't really have to\nworry about them too much anymore.\n\n502\n00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,181\nSo let's take a look at that feature.\n\n503\n00:27:03,181 --> 00:27:07,593\nNow, what time machine does\nis it runs in the background,\n\n504\n00:27:07,593 --> 00:27:12,815\nwithout you having to mess with it too\nmuch and it backs up your data and\n\n505\n00:27:12,815 --> 00:27:17,460\nwhat it's doing is it's doing\nbackups every single hour.\n\n506\n00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:20,640\nSo, once an hour it's trying\nto backup your information.\n\n507\n00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,890\nNow, if you have a lot of data,\nyou might say to yourself, wait,\n\n508\n00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:27,930\nhow does it backup all\nof my data once an hour?\n\n509\n00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:29,410\nAnd the answer is it doesn't.\n\n510\n00:27:29,410 --> 00:27:32,400\nWhat it does is it just\nbacks up what changed.\n\n511\n00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,610\nThe first time machine\nbackup that you run,\n\n512\n00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:40,010\nwill backup your entire set\nof data the whole shebang.\n\n513\n00:27:40,010 --> 00:27:43,940\nAnd then every hour after that it\njust had to catch what changes.\n\n514\n00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:46,350\nAnd that means it can run very, very fast.\n\n515\n00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:49,810\nIt's just getting that changed data,\nwhich is really cool.\n\n516\n00:27:49,810 --> 00:27:57,130\nAnd what it'll do, is it'll maintain\nan hourly backup, for the last 24 hours.\n\n517\n00:27:57,130 --> 00:28:02,545\nAnd then it will maintain a daily\nbackup for the last 30 days or month.\n\n518\n00:28:02,545 --> 00:28:05,389\nFor the last month or,\nwell yeah 30 days, whatever.\n\n519\n00:28:05,389 --> 00:28:09,690\nSome months have 31 days, some have 28,\nwhatever, but it's for the last month.\n\n520\n00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:12,420\nSo it'll maintain daily backups.\n\n521\n00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:17,190\nAnd then it will maintain weekly\nbackups for the time before that\n\n522\n00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:20,445\nall the way until you fill up your\nTime Machine hard drive, all right.\n\n523\n00:28:20,445 --> 00:28:21,860\nAnd you know, eventually,\nyou run out of space.\n\n524\n00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:23,306\nYou can't save the backups forever.\n\n525\n00:28:23,306 --> 00:28:27,320\nSo, you'll have hourly backups from today.\n\n526\n00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:30,400\nYou'll have daily backups\nfrom the last 30 days.\n\n527\n00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:35,070\nAnd then, prior to that, so, last month\nand before, we'll have weekly backups,\n\n528\n00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:37,800\nas far back as we can go,\nuntil we fill up our hard drive.\n\n529\n00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:38,420\nAll right.\n\n530\n00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:40,770\nSo, that's what Time Machine does.\n\n531\n00:28:40,770 --> 00:28:44,140\nIt's running, backing up our data.\n\n532\n00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:47,700\nIf we ever have some kind of a failure,\nwe can recover our data from there.\n\n533\n00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:50,240\nNow, what type of failures could we have?\n\n534\n00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,350\nWell, there's the old\nclassic hard drive failure.\n\n535\n00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:57,590\nWhen you have traditional SATA drives,\nthe Serial ATA drive,\n\n536\n00:28:57,590 --> 00:29:00,030\nthey have spinning\nplatters inside of them.\n\n537\n00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:01,220\nThey're moving parts.\n\n538\n00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:04,820\nAnd if you've got a laptop that\ngets jostled around a lot, well,\n\n539\n00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:06,260\nthose drives can get damaged.\n\n540\n00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:09,600\nMost of those drives are rated for\nthree years of life anyway.\n\n541\n00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,860\nSo even if don't jostle it,\n\n542\n00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:15,130\neven if you baby your laptop,\nafter three years, the chance of that\n\n543\n00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:19,370\ndrive failing starts to increase\nexponentially as each year goes on.\n\n544\n00:29:19,370 --> 00:29:23,050\nYou'll hear about people who have had hard\ndrives last for eight years, all right.\n\n545\n00:29:23,050 --> 00:29:25,970\nBut you hear about people who had a hard\ndrive die in the first year they had it.\n\n546\n00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:28,750\nIt's not a factual thing.\n\n547\n00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:31,850\nWe don't know precisely when\na drive is going to die.\n\n548\n00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:35,380\nBut on average the drives are rated for\nthree years.\n\n549\n00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:38,890\nSo, after three years you definitely\nwant to make sure you have that backup.\n\n550\n00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:40,310\nThat drive could fail.\n\n551\n00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:44,490\nWe see the same thing with the new\nsolid state digital drives, the SSDs.\n\n552\n00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:47,910\nSSDs have a limit to how many\ntimes you can write to them,\n\n553\n00:29:47,910 --> 00:29:51,680\nand every time you write data\nto them it decreases the life.\n\n554\n00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:54,110\nNow they're normally rated for\nmillions of writes, so\n\n555\n00:29:54,110 --> 00:29:55,530\nyou can write to it quite a lot.\n\n556\n00:29:55,530 --> 00:29:58,550\nBut after a few years,\nyou'll start to hit that limit, and\n\n557\n00:29:58,550 --> 00:30:01,750\nthen the integrity of that drive\nstarts to drop, all right.\n\n558\n00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:06,070\nSo we had Tim here in the office just a\nfew weeks ago had this happened, where he\n\n559\n00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:11,850\nhad two hard drives in his Mac, he's got\na MacPro, and one of the drives died.\n\n560\n00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:15,840\nAnd it was the one he had his operating\nsystem on, and he couldn't boot up and\n\n561\n00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,210\nhe lost that data.\n\n562\n00:30:17,210 --> 00:30:20,460\nWell fortunately,\nhe had Time Machine backups, and\n\n563\n00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:22,890\nso all he had to do was\nget that drive replaced.\n\n564\n00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:26,200\nIt was under warranty, so\nhe took it down to the Apple store, and\n\n565\n00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:29,630\nthey replaced the hard drive, and\nwhen Apple replaces the hard drive for\n\n566\n00:30:29,630 --> 00:30:34,515\nyou, it's already got Mac OS on it,\nso he didn't put the hard drive in.\n\n567\n00:30:34,515 --> 00:30:35,355\nThey put it in for him.\n\n568\n00:30:35,355 --> 00:30:39,235\nHe just brought it back to the office and\npowered it on, and it's running Mac OS.\n\n569\n00:30:39,235 --> 00:30:41,305\nBut it's a clean install, right?\n\n570\n00:30:41,305 --> 00:30:44,940\nIt's a regular old install that\ndoesn't have any of his stuff.\n\n571\n00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:48,990\nAnd then he was able to fire up Time\nMachine, and restore all his data to it.\n\n572\n00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:50,790\nAnd it was like he hadn't lost anything.\n\n573\n00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:53,130\nTime Machine had been\ndoing backups every hour.\n\n574\n00:30:53,130 --> 00:30:54,971\nSo when he had that failure,\n\n575\n00:30:54,971 --> 00:30:58,515\nhe really at a maximum would\nlose about an hour of data.\n\n576\n00:30:58,515 --> 00:31:01,801\nWell fortunately for him, one day ended,\nhe went home, he came in,\n\n577\n00:31:01,801 --> 00:31:03,740\nin the morning, and the drive was dead.\n\n578\n00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:07,020\nSo, it was after an evening\nof no changes happening, and\n\n579\n00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:09,180\nso, he didn't lose any data at all.\n\n580\n00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:11,060\nAnd, that's a common scenario.\n\n581\n00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:12,860\nNow, that's a hardware failure.\n\n582\n00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:16,290\nYou can also have a people failure too.\n\n583\n00:31:16,290 --> 00:31:18,920\nHave you ever accidentally\ndeleted a document?\n\n584\n00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:22,520\nWell you know, the recycle bin is kind\nof helpful, we can go in there and\n\n585\n00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:25,990\npull it out of the trash so\nwe don't actually lose that data.\n\n586\n00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:30,860\nBut what if you make some changes\nto a document and save it?\n\n587\n00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:35,390\nSo you just saved over the previous\ndocument, and then you say, oh,\n\n588\n00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:38,470\nshoot, I deleted a paragraph and\nI want that paragraph back.\n\n589\n00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:40,290\nWell, the document's not gone.\n\n590\n00:31:40,290 --> 00:31:41,520\nThe document's not in your trash.\n\n591\n00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:44,715\nYou just saved over a piece of it,\nnow it's gone.\n\n592\n00:31:44,715 --> 00:31:48,995\nWith Time Machine, you can see that\ndocument as it was an hour ago, or\n\n593\n00:31:48,995 --> 00:31:51,125\nfive hours ago, or two weeks ago.\n\n594\n00:31:51,125 --> 00:31:52,889\nSo you can start to look back and\nsee that data.\n\n595\n00:31:52,889 --> 00:31:55,215\nSo that's the real power\nthat Time Machine gives us.\n\n596\n00:31:55,215 --> 00:31:56,471\nAll right.\n\n597\n00:31:56,471 --> 00:32:01,208\nNow when you fire up a brand new Mac It's\nnot, well, it's running time machine,\n\n598\n00:32:01,208 --> 00:32:04,310\nbut time machine's not doing anything,\nall right.\n\n599\n00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:06,280\nAnd we'll use my laptop as an example,\nright.\n\n600\n00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:09,450\nSo this is a Macbook Pro and\nI've got a 500,\n\n601\n00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:13,580\nI think I've got a 500 gig SSD\nin it is what my hard drive is.\n\n602\n00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:15,100\nLet me just double-check.\n\n603\n00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:17,982\nYeah, so\nI've got a 500 gig drive in my laptop,\n\n604\n00:32:17,982 --> 00:32:22,640\nall right, and when I fire it\nup it's just got that one drive.\n\n605\n00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,980\nIf I lose that drive, I lose everything.\n\n606\n00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:26,780\nWell, I do my backups too,\n\n607\n00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:29,920\nbut I lose everything that's\nhere on this drive, right.\n\n608\n00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:35,020\nSo I can see up here in my menu bar,\nthis little\n\n609\n00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:39,760\nit looks like a clock with an arrow going\naround it and it's kind of grayed out.\n\n610\n00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,260\nThat's time machine.\n\n611\n00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:44,160\nYou're running time machine by default.\n\n612\n00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,980\nBut it's not doing anything.\n\n613\n00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:51,140\nAnd the reason is you can't back\nup one drive to the same drive.\n\n614\n00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:52,630\nThat defeats the purpose.\n\n615\n00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:55,560\nBecause if you have a drive failure\nyou'd lose the backups too.\n\n616\n00:32:55,560 --> 00:33:00,710\nSo, by default when you take that new\nApple machine out of the box Time Machine\n\n617\n00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:05,200\ncan't do its job because it doesn't have\nanywhere to store your backup, all right?\n\n618\n00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:09,290\nSo if I click on that,\nI can see Time Machine Not Configured, and\n\n619\n00:33:09,290 --> 00:33:10,750\nit's just sitting there.\n\n620\n00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:11,860\nAll right.\n\n621\n00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:15,960\nSo what I need to do is I need\nto configure time machine\n\n622\n00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,750\nto be able to backup.\n\n623\n00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:21,100\nAnd there's really two places\nthat we can backup to.\n\n624\n00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:25,720\nThe first place is if we wanted\nto backup to a hard drive.\n\n625\n00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:26,900\nAnd that's what we\nare normally going to do.\n\n626\n00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:31,310\nWe are normally going to take an external\nhard drive and use it for time machine.\n\n627\n00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:34,250\nThe advantage of an external hard\ndrive is you can back up to it and\n\n628\n00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:36,620\nthen you can disconnect it and\ntake it off site.\n\n629\n00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:38,240\nYou can store it somewhere else.\n\n630\n00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,370\nAnd that way if you have\na building burn down,\n\n631\n00:33:40,370 --> 00:33:43,530\nyou've got that time machine\nstored somewhere else.\n\n632\n00:33:43,530 --> 00:33:47,060\nThe other thing is,\nif my entire laptop dies and\n\n633\n00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:50,160\nI have to send it in for warranty\nrepair I can just pop this disk off.\n\n634\n00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:50,670\nSo I've got it.\n\n635\n00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:55,480\nAnd they can just send me a new laptop and\nI can just stick this on it and restore.\n\n636\n00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:58,180\nWe can even use it as a migration\nmethod if we get a new laptop.\n\n637\n00:33:58,180 --> 00:34:01,050\nWe can take our time machine back up and\ngo pull data to the new machine.\n\n638\n00:34:01,050 --> 00:34:04,690\nSo, a lot of flexibility when\nyou do an external drive.\n\n639\n00:34:04,690 --> 00:34:08,090\nThe other option is that we\ncould use a network share.\n\n640\n00:34:08,090 --> 00:34:13,220\nWe could have a location on our network,\nwe could mount that network drive and\n\n641\n00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:15,930\nthen we could do a time\nmachine back up to that.\n\n642\n00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:21,240\nYou know what, I wasn't planning on it,\nbut I'll show an example here in the show.\n\n643\n00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:24,710\nThe only limitation with that is that the\nFile Share needs to be mounted using AFP.\n\n644\n00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:26,730\nIt's got to be Apple File Protocol.\n\n645\n00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:33,240\nSo, you can't do a time machine backup\ndown to NFS or SMB, or a Windows Share.\n\n646\n00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:35,350\nIt has to be something\nusing Apple File Protocol,\n\n647\n00:34:35,350 --> 00:34:37,312\nand then we can back up to that, too.\n\n648\n00:34:37,312 --> 00:34:40,510\nAll right, so if I want o configure\nTime Machine with an external drive,\n\n649\n00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:41,540\nit's super easy.\n\n650\n00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:44,130\nYou just take your external drive and\nyou plug it in, and\n\n651\n00:34:44,130 --> 00:34:48,760\nif it's the first time you've plugged\nin that drive, then you'll get\n\n652\n00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:53,620\na message asking you if you want to use\nthis drive for Time Machine, all right?\n\n653\n00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:57,750\nNow if you say yes to that It's\ngoing to format your drive.\n\n654\n00:34:57,750 --> 00:34:58,760\nAll right.\n\n655\n00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:02,330\nThe drive has to be used exclusively for\ntime machine.\n\n656\n00:35:02,330 --> 00:35:06,090\nSo if I have this drive, this one, I use\nthis on the show earlier, talking about\n\n657\n00:35:06,090 --> 00:35:10,340\nmoving data from a Windows machine to\na Mac, if I'm using it for other stuff,\n\n658\n00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:13,550\nwhen I tell it to use this drive for\ntime machine I'm going to lose that.\n\n659\n00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:18,440\nI'm not going to be able to use it.\n\n660\n00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:23,390\nSo, once separate time machine,\nit's just separate time machine.\n\n661\n00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:26,100\nI cleared that dialogue message\nthat I got earlier and said,\n\n662\n00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:28,680\n\"No, I don't want to use this.\" That's\nwhy I'm not getting a pop-up here.\n\n663\n00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:31,690\nIf I want to see that pop-up again,\nI can just format the driver real quick.\n\n664\n00:35:31,690 --> 00:35:33,980\nThat'll cause the pop-up to reappear.\n\n665\n00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:37,310\nSo let me fire up my Disk Utility, and\nI'll take that one and I'll format it.\n\n666\n00:35:37,310 --> 00:35:40,210\nNow, it doesn't really matter\nwhat file system I format it.\n\n667\n00:35:40,210 --> 00:35:46,000\nFor Time Machine, it has to use the Mac\nOS Extended Journaling file system.\n\n668\n00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,189\nI can format it whatever I want because\nwhen you turn on Time Machine it's going\n\n669\n00:35:49,189 --> 00:35:50,170\nto reformat it anyway.\n\n670\n00:35:50,170 --> 00:35:54,700\nSo even if it's already\nrunning the Mac OS format\n\n671\n00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:58,170\nit's still going to reformat it just\nto make sure that it's clean and empty.\n\n672\n00:35:58,170 --> 00:36:01,170\nSo I'll go ahead and\njust do the Mac OS extended journal.\n\n673\n00:36:01,170 --> 00:36:02,660\nAll right.\n\n674\n00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,170\nSo, I'm going to go ahead and erase it.\n\n675\n00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:06,710\nAnd when it erases it it'll\nsee it as a new drive and\n\n676\n00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:09,120\nthat's going to make that\ndialog box pop back up.\n\n677\n00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:11,420\nEventually.\n\n678\n00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:12,850\nI got to wait for it to finish.\n\n679\n00:36:12,850 --> 00:36:13,920\nI guess I'm being impatient.\n\n680\n00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:14,750\nThere we go.\n\n681\n00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:17,600\nAnd so now I get the dialog box and\nI can go back into it and\n\n682\n00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,190\ndo it this way, all right.\n\n683\n00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:22,430\nNow, if you don't want to format it,\nyou don't have to.\n\n684\n00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:24,230\nSo I could say decide Later.\n\n685\n00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:24,920\nRight?\n\n686\n00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:27,410\nAnd so\nI'm just going to clear that dialog box.\n\n687\n00:36:27,410 --> 00:36:30,300\nIf I wanted to use it, I could have\njust hit yeah, use it for backup.\n\n688\n00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:33,140\nBut if you want to choose it without\nwaiting for that pop-up, you can always go\n\n689\n00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:38,620\nto your time machine up here, and you can\nchoose Open Time Machine Preferences,\n\n690\n00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:42,680\nand in the preferences,\nyou can select a backup disk.\n\n691\n00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:46,590\nAnd so I could've also gone right here and\npicked it without the dialogue box.\n\n692\n00:36:46,590 --> 00:36:48,510\nSo either way works.\n\n693\n00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:51,710\nAll right, so I'm going to go ahead and\nchoose that drive and I'll hit use disc.\n\n694\n00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:56,220\nNow there is an option here\nthat says encrypt back-ups.\n\n695\n00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:59,630\nDave mentioned this is the chat room\nduring one of the episodes we were doing\n\n696\n00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:02,630\nearlier we were talking about File Vault.\n\n697\n00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:06,350\nAnd now we can use File Vault\nto encrypt our Macintosh HD.\n\n698\n00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:10,410\nAnd that way, if somebody steals our\nlaptop, the hard drive encrypted.\n\n699\n00:37:10,410 --> 00:37:14,740\nWell, Time Machine backups\nare not encrypted by default.\n\n700\n00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:17,210\nSo they're not encrypted.\n\n701\n00:37:17,210 --> 00:37:21,200\nThat means that somebody got this disk,\nthey would have an unencrypted copy of\n\n702\n00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,960\nyour data that they could then try\nto restore to their own machine.\n\n703\n00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:24,670\nAll right.\n\n704\n00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:27,570\nSo if you're worried about that\nlevel of security, if you're worried\n\n705\n00:37:27,570 --> 00:37:31,230\nabout losing that drive if you're not\nmaintaining good physical security,\n\n706\n00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:35,320\nyou'll want to encrypt the back ups, but\nhere's a word of caution, all right?\n\n707\n00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:38,920\nI mentioned in the file vault show\nthat you have that recovery key.\n\n708\n00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:42,690\nAnd if you forget your administrator\npassword or your password for logging into\n\n709\n00:37:42,690 --> 00:37:48,250\nthe machine, then you need that recovery\nkey to decrypt your hard drive.\n\n710\n00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:53,080\nWell you'll need that recovery key to\ndecrypt your Time Machine backup also.\n\n711\n00:37:54,210 --> 00:37:59,290\nIf you forget your username or password,\nand you don't have that recovery key,\n\n712\n00:37:59,290 --> 00:38:02,230\nnot only do you not have\naccess to your PC anymore, but\n\n713\n00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:05,400\nyou don't have access to your\ntime machine backup either.\n\n714\n00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:08,000\nSo, you could effectively lock\nyour self out of that backup.\n\n715\n00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,960\nSo, be careful with that.\n\n716\n00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,430\nIf you encrypt the backups,\n\n717\n00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:15,150\nmake doubly sure that you're\nbacking up that recovery key.\n\n718\n00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:16,550\nJust in case.\n\n719\n00:38:16,550 --> 00:38:18,080\nAnd store it somewhere securely.\n\n720\n00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:18,630\nAll right.\n\n721\n00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:20,490\nAnother option would be not to encrypt it,\nbut\n\n722\n00:38:20,490 --> 00:38:22,740\nstore the physical hard\ndrive somewhere securely.\n\n723\n00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:26,120\nLock them in a safe or something when\nthey're not attached to your computer,\n\n724\n00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:28,780\nso it just kind of depends on how\nyou want to go about with that.\n\n725\n00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:31,910\nBut you do have that option\nto encrypt the backup.\n\n726\n00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:33,150\nAll right.\nI'm not going to do that for right now.\n\n727\n00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:37,130\nI'll just hit Use the Disk,\nand now I'm using it.\n\n728\n00:38:37,130 --> 00:38:39,835\nAnd see how it turned on\ntime machine automatically.\n\n729\n00:38:39,835 --> 00:38:41,985\nJust flipped that switch to on for me.\n\n730\n00:38:41,985 --> 00:38:42,615\nNow it's running.\n\n731\n00:38:44,085 --> 00:38:48,945\nIt's right now going to kick off and\ndo my first time machine back up.\n\n732\n00:38:48,945 --> 00:38:50,702\nSo it's looking at my hard drive.\n\n733\n00:38:50,702 --> 00:38:52,072\nAnd it's starting to do the backup.\n\n734\n00:38:52,072 --> 00:38:55,272\nAnd see how it says next backup in,\nit was two minutes, right?\n\n735\n00:38:55,272 --> 00:38:58,138\nSo now it's counting down to\nkick off that first backup.\n\n736\n00:38:58,138 --> 00:39:03,102\nSo it's going to start backing up\ndata from my Macintosh HD over here\n\n737\n00:39:03,102 --> 00:39:04,152\nto the hard drive.\n\n738\n00:39:04,152 --> 00:39:06,092\nNow the first backup is\ngoing to take a while.\n\n739\n00:39:06,092 --> 00:39:11,532\nIf I look at my hard drive, it's 500\ngigs and I'm using about 350 gigs of it.\n\n740\n00:39:11,532 --> 00:39:15,640\nSo it's got to back up 350 gigs of data.\n\n741\n00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:18,420\nI can use the system while\nit's doing the backup, but\n\n742\n00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:20,340\nit'll make the backup take longer.\n\n743\n00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:24,680\nSo what you normally do is start this up,\nand then go to sleep, or go home and\n\n744\n00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:27,460\nlet it run overnight for\nthat first backup.\n\n745\n00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:31,510\nFrom then on,\nit's going to backup once an hour, and\n\n746\n00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:34,730\nit's backing up every hour and\nit's just getting the changes.\n\n747\n00:39:34,730 --> 00:39:38,000\nSo it's a much faster backup,\ndoesn't take as much time.\n\n748\n00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,410\nAnd it churns along and\nkeeps you up to date.\n\n749\n00:39:40,410 --> 00:39:44,940\nNow my hard drive is one terabyte in size,\nthis external hard drive.\n\n750\n00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:48,140\nSo it's going to back up\nthe 350 gigs of data.\n\n751\n00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:52,560\nAnd then every hour it's backing up\nthe changes, and then it'll maintain daily\n\n752\n00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:56,141\nbackups for 30 days and\nweekly backups until the drive is full.\n\n753\n00:39:56,141 --> 00:40:00,154\nI'll probably be able to get several\nmonths of backups to fit in this 1\n\n754\n00:40:00,154 --> 00:40:04,045\nterabyte drive, because my hard\ndrive is only 500 gigs in size.\n\n755\n00:40:04,045 --> 00:40:04,674\nRight.\nSo\n\n756\n00:40:04,674 --> 00:40:09,557\nI would have to change the entire contents\nof my hard drive in order to fill up\n\n757\n00:40:09,557 --> 00:40:12,640\nthis one terabyte drive,\nit would take a lot.\n\n758\n00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,822\nSo I'll probably be able to get\nquite a bit of data on there.\n\n759\n00:40:14,822 --> 00:40:16,370\nAll right.\n\n760\n00:40:16,370 --> 00:40:17,690\nAnd it's letting me know down here.\n\n761\n00:40:17,690 --> 00:40:20,590\nHourly backups, daily backups,\nand weekly backups, and\n\n762\n00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:22,290\ngiving me that interval\nright there on the screen.\n\n763\n00:40:23,410 --> 00:40:27,060\nIf you go into options, you'll see just a\nfew little things in here, like whether or\n\n764\n00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:30,720\nnot we want to allow backups while\non battery power, you might not,\n\n765\n00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:34,080\nbecause the back up operations\ncan drain the battery a good bit.\n\n766\n00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:37,250\nNotify after old backups are deleted.\n\n767\n00:40:37,250 --> 00:40:40,420\nThat's a good option to have on, because\nit will let you know when your drive is\n\n768\n00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:43,510\nfinally full, cuz it might be months\nfrom now that it's actually full.\n\n769\n00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:45,260\nSo it can tell us about that.\n\n770\n00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:46,050\nAll right.\n\n771\n00:40:46,050 --> 00:40:51,450\nAlso, you can have more than one hard\ndrive that you use for Time Machine.\n\n772\n00:40:51,450 --> 00:40:52,870\nSo you could add a second drive or\n\n773\n00:40:52,870 --> 00:40:56,230\na third drive and set them for\nTime Machine also and do rotations.\n\n774\n00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:56,930\nThat's always nice.\n\n775\n00:40:56,930 --> 00:40:59,400\nYou might have one off site and\none on site, and\n\n776\n00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:03,160\nyou switch them out every few days to\nget a nice, reliable backup strategy.\n\n777\n00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:05,730\nSo another good system to have.\n\n778\n00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:06,540\nAll right.\n\n779\n00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:09,810\nAnd you could also exclude\nthings from the backups.\n\n780\n00:41:09,810 --> 00:41:14,490\nSo, for example, I've got a bunch of\nvirtual machines on my system, and\n\n781\n00:41:14,490 --> 00:41:19,150\nso I might want to exclude\nmy virtual machine's folder.\n\n782\n00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:22,470\nSee how my virtual machine's\nfolder has 109 gigs.\n\n783\n00:41:22,470 --> 00:41:29,650\nI had 350 gigs on my system,\n109 gigs of it is my virtual machine's.\n\n784\n00:41:29,650 --> 00:41:32,500\nSo, I might not want to back those up so\nI can exclude that, and\n\n785\n00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:36,010\nthat'll make my backups a little bit\nsmaller and a little bit faster.\n\n786\n00:41:36,010 --> 00:41:36,850\nAnd see what it just did.\n\n787\n00:41:36,850 --> 00:41:38,760\nIt's going to have to restart the backup.\n\n788\n00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:41,880\nNow that I made that change\nIt's got to start over again.\n\n789\n00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:43,370\nAnd it'll do that back up on my system.\n\n790\n00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:50,130\nSo those are some of the things that\nwe can tweak with Time Machine.\n\n791\n00:41:50,130 --> 00:41:54,133\nAnd notice on my desktop the icon for\nthat hard drive changed.\n\n792\n00:41:54,133 --> 00:41:57,385\nSo now it's letting me know that\nthis is a Time Machine drive.\n\n793\n00:41:57,385 --> 00:42:00,635\nI shouldn't use it to try and\nstore data on it.\n\n794\n00:42:00,635 --> 00:42:04,505\nAnd if I double click on it, I can see my\nbackups, you can actually navigate in and\n\n795\n00:42:04,505 --> 00:42:06,405\nsee what's being put in there.\n\n796\n00:42:06,405 --> 00:42:08,125\nWell mine's kinda empty right now.\n\n797\n00:42:08,125 --> 00:42:10,535\nYou shouldn't use it for\nregular data at that point,\n\n798\n00:42:10,535 --> 00:42:12,672\nyou should just use it for Time Machine.\n\n799\n00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:15,830\nAll right.\n\n800\n00:42:15,830 --> 00:42:17,264\nWell, let's do this.\n\n801\n00:42:17,264 --> 00:42:20,142\nI wasn't planning on it, but I think\nit would be a good idea to show you\n\n802\n00:42:20,142 --> 00:42:23,186\nguys using Time Machine with a network\ndrive, so I want to show you that.\n\n803\n00:42:23,186 --> 00:42:27,376\nThis backup's going to take a little\nwhile, so why don't we stop and\n\n804\n00:42:27,376 --> 00:42:32,144\ntake a break, and I'll let that backup\nrun, and I'll whip up a network server\n\n805\n00:42:32,144 --> 00:42:37,011\nreal quick to be able to demonstrate using\na network location for Time Machine.\n\n806\n00:42:37,011 --> 00:42:40,193\nSo if you're watching this recorded,\nthrough the magic of television,\n\n807\n00:42:40,193 --> 00:42:43,528\nthis'll happen pretty quickly, but\nif you're watching this live, give me\n\n808\n00:42:43,528 --> 00:42:47,051\na few minutes while I get this set up, and\nthen we'll be able to jump in and see it.\n\n809\n00:42:47,051 --> 00:42:49,570\nSo stay tuned, we'll be back in a few.\n\n810\n00:42:49,570 --> 00:42:52,197\n[SOUND]\n\n811\n00:42:52,197 --> 00:42:57,453\nAll right.\n\n812\n00:42:57,453 --> 00:42:58,720\nWelcome back everybody.\n\n813\n00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:03,200\nSo my Time Machine back up on my laptop\nsays that it's got three hours remaining,\n\n814\n00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:04,250\nand I'm a little impatient.\n\n815\n00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:05,730\nSo I'm not going to wait for that.\n\n816\n00:43:05,730 --> 00:43:08,160\nBut I do want to show you guys, backing up\n\n817\n00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:12,320\nto a network share instead of an external\ndrive like we were doing a moment ago.\n\n818\n00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:15,320\nBacking up to the network\nshare is actually pretty easy.\n\n819\n00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:17,830\nBasically, you pick a machine\nto host your backup.\n\n820\n00:43:17,830 --> 00:43:20,650\nThere's some Apple machine in\nyour environment somewhere, and\n\n821\n00:43:20,650 --> 00:43:22,920\nyou can create a hard drive,\nI mean a folder.\n\n822\n00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:25,160\nI created a folder called Backups.\n\n823\n00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:26,040\nAll right?\n\n824\n00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:27,150\nThen you can just share it out.\n\n825\n00:43:27,150 --> 00:43:29,170\nJust like we did in the sharing episodes.\n\n826\n00:43:29,170 --> 00:43:30,850\nWe share out that folder.\n\n827\n00:43:30,850 --> 00:43:33,020\nI created this Backups folder.\n\n828\n00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:36,090\nAnd whoever we want to allow to back up\nto it, we'll need to give them read and\n\n829\n00:43:36,090 --> 00:43:39,170\nwrite access to it, so\nI'm just using my HelpDesk account here.\n\n830\n00:43:39,170 --> 00:43:43,310\nSo set up a shared folder just like\nwe did in the sharing episode.\n\n831\n00:43:44,810 --> 00:43:47,200\nTwo caveats here to get this to work.\n\n832\n00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:51,460\nFirst, that folder you set up needs to be\nstored on a hard drive that's formatted\n\n833\n00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:57,110\nwith the Mac OS extended\njournaling file system.\n\n834\n00:43:57,110 --> 00:43:59,190\nDon't try and store it on a FAT,\nor exFAT drive.\n\n835\n00:43:59,190 --> 00:44:01,890\nIt's got to be the Mac OS drive format.\n\n836\n00:44:01,890 --> 00:44:05,840\nThe other thing is, when we share it out,\n\n837\n00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:09,120\nTime Machine only works over\nApple file protocol, over AFP.\n\n838\n00:44:10,390 --> 00:44:13,190\nEven when you connect between Macs,\n\n839\n00:44:13,190 --> 00:44:16,420\nsometimes they'll connect\nusing SMB instead.\n\n840\n00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:21,330\nSo if you find that your share is not\nshowing up in your Time Machine list,\n\n841\n00:44:21,330 --> 00:44:25,140\none little trick is to just disable SMB,\nif you're not using it, right?\n\n842\n00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:26,900\nIf you've got an all Apple environment.\n\n843\n00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:29,320\nSo when you go into your\nsharing preferences, so\n\n844\n00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:35,080\nif I go into my system preferences,\nand sharing, what you can do is\n\n845\n00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:40,380\nyou can go in here into your options,\nand you can turn off that SMB sharing.\n\n846\n00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:43,960\nSee how I've actually got connections\non AFP and SMB right now, and\n\n847\n00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:47,120\nthat's because every now and\nthen SMB takes precedence over AFP,\n\n848\n00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:50,140\nit's a weird thing, so\nyou might need to turn that off.\n\n849\n00:44:50,140 --> 00:44:52,840\nYou might not, so\ndon't turn it off just right off the bat,\n\n850\n00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:54,160\ncuz you might not need to.\n\n851\n00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:55,780\nJust, if I ever see quirky behavior,\n\n852\n00:44:55,780 --> 00:44:58,370\nthat's one of the things\nthat I usually jump to.\n\n853\n00:44:58,370 --> 00:45:02,050\nAll right, so once we've got a shared\nfolder, we jump over to the machine we\n\n854\n00:45:02,050 --> 00:45:05,925\nwanna back up, so I want to back up my\nserver, and so I'm going to go into my\n\n855\n00:45:05,925 --> 00:45:11,155\nTime Machine preferences here, and\nwe'll just go to Select a Backup Disk.\n\n856\n00:45:11,155 --> 00:45:15,665\nAnd in my backup disk list, I see my\nlocal disk that I could back up to, and\n\n857\n00:45:15,665 --> 00:45:18,135\nI also see that backup share.\n\n858\n00:45:18,135 --> 00:45:20,735\nNow, I only see the backup share\nhere because I'm already connected.\n\n859\n00:45:20,735 --> 00:45:24,700\nSo if I wasn't connected, I would need\nto go to Go and Connect to Server and\n\n860\n00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:27,620\nconnect to that share.\n\n861\n00:45:27,620 --> 00:45:28,440\nAnd see, when I connect to it,\n\n862\n00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:32,680\nI'm doing AFP:// the client name and\nthe folder name.\n\n863\n00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:33,890\nAll right.\n\n864\n00:45:33,890 --> 00:45:37,294\nMaking sure that I use\nthat Apple file protocol.\n\n865\n00:45:37,294 --> 00:45:39,987\nBut, assuming I'm connected,\nI can pick that network share, and\n\n866\n00:45:39,987 --> 00:45:41,590\nI can choose to use the disk.\n\n867\n00:45:41,590 --> 00:45:45,800\nI need to provide my credentials to do it,\nand it's going to connect up, and\n\n868\n00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:48,652\nnow I've got a network Time Machine drive.\n\n869\n00:45:48,652 --> 00:45:49,820\nAll right.\n\n870\n00:45:49,820 --> 00:45:52,797\nAnd so it's gonna start backing\nup to that other system, so\n\n871\n00:45:52,797 --> 00:45:55,476\nwhatever data I've got here\nit's gonna back up, and\n\n872\n00:45:55,476 --> 00:45:59,066\nthen it's gonna start doing hourly\nbackups to that network location.\n\n873\n00:45:59,066 --> 00:46:00,385\nA couple of advantages here,\n\n874\n00:46:00,385 --> 00:46:03,827\none, we're not having to worry about\nan external drive, so there's that.\n\n875\n00:46:03,827 --> 00:46:08,850\nAnd then two, this network share can be\nused by more than one machine at once.\n\n876\n00:46:08,850 --> 00:46:10,680\nI can create separate\nfolders that I share out for\n\n877\n00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:12,740\neach of my machines I\nwant to back up to it.\n\n878\n00:46:12,740 --> 00:46:14,730\nAnd it can even be on a separate network.\n\n879\n00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:16,760\nSo it doesn't even have to be\nin the same building as me.\n\n880\n00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:21,320\nI can automate an offsite backup right\nhere, where once an hour, I'm backing up\n\n881\n00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:24,280\nmy changes to a system that's in\nanother building, in another location.\n\n882\n00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:27,110\nSo pretty cool stuff there\nto be able to do that.\n\n883\n00:46:27,110 --> 00:46:30,530\nNow network backups\nare going to be slower.\n\n884\n00:46:30,530 --> 00:46:33,120\nThey do take longer because\nnetwork bandwidth is\n\n885\n00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:35,840\nmuch much smaller then what\nwe have with disc access.\n\n886\n00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:39,320\nIf you've got a USB 3 drive well it\nwas telling me mine was going to\n\n887\n00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:40,810\ntake 3 hours a minute ago.\n\n888\n00:46:40,810 --> 00:46:45,190\nDoing that same backup over the network\nit might take 9 hours or even longer,\n\n889\n00:46:45,190 --> 00:46:47,790\nso it can take a significantly\nlonger amount of time.\n\n890\n00:46:47,790 --> 00:46:48,950\nSo be aware of that.\n\n891\n00:46:50,330 --> 00:46:52,680\nAll right.\nNow once we've set our backups, and\n\n892\n00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:54,480\nwe've turned on Time Machine, that's it.\n\n893\n00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:55,230\nWe just walk away.\n\n894\n00:46:55,230 --> 00:46:56,100\nIt's done.\nit runs.\n\n895\n00:46:56,100 --> 00:46:57,510\nIt does it's backups.\n\n896\n00:46:57,510 --> 00:47:00,350\nIf you every need to get\ndata out of it again,\n\n897\n00:47:00,350 --> 00:47:03,710\nall you have to do is pull down\nyour Time Machine menu and\n\n898\n00:47:03,710 --> 00:47:07,770\nyou'll see this option right here,\nenter Time Machine, all right.\n\n899\n00:47:07,770 --> 00:47:10,630\nYou're entering the Time Machine and\ngoing back in time.\n\n900\n00:47:10,630 --> 00:47:15,900\nAnd what it basically does is it\nopens up a special Finder window,\n\n901\n00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:19,090\nand it's gonna, well shoot,\nI don't have any backups.\n\n902\n00:47:19,090 --> 00:47:22,800\nBut it's a special Finder window,\nbasically, that allows you to go through\n\n903\n00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:27,600\nand search for files, and see all of\nthe previous versions that were backed up.\n\n904\n00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:31,580\nYou should see, and it's based on changes,\nso if the file didn't change today,\n\n905\n00:47:31,580 --> 00:47:33,600\nyou're not gonna see one every hour.\n\n906\n00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:36,210\nSo you'll see the most recent\nversion in that file and\n\n907\n00:47:36,210 --> 00:47:38,750\nthen the previous changes that\nwere stored in the backups.\n\n908\n00:47:39,910 --> 00:47:43,700\nAnd you can recover the most\nrecent one if you've got it or\n\n909\n00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:47,620\nyou can recover older ones if\nthat's what you need to get back to\n\n910\n00:47:47,620 --> 00:47:50,160\nbefore the change that\nyou're trying to undo.\n\n911\n00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:51,250\nSo it's pretty straight forward.\n\n912\n00:47:51,250 --> 00:47:53,700\nPretty easy to use, and\nyou can get at your data.\n\n913\n00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:58,130\nNow if your computer completely failed,\nthen you'd be taking your Time Machine\n\n914\n00:47:58,130 --> 00:48:01,820\ndisk and plugging it into\na completely different computer.\n\n915\n00:48:01,820 --> 00:48:05,830\nAnd so on that computer,\nwhen you go to enter Time Machine, well,\n\n916\n00:48:05,830 --> 00:48:08,100\nit's gonna try and\nenter its own Time Machine backup.\n\n917\n00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:11,780\nSince you may need to go into your\nTime Machine preferences, and add in that\n\n918\n00:48:11,780 --> 00:48:15,610\nalternate disk to be able to see it and\npull data out of that, all right.\n\n919\n00:48:15,610 --> 00:48:17,010\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n920\n00:48:17,010 --> 00:48:20,140\nBut otherwise,\nTime Machine's pretty straightforward.\n\n921\n00:48:20,140 --> 00:48:21,880\nThis one's gonna churn through and\ndo its backup, but\n\n922\n00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:23,380\nI'm not gonna wait for it either.\n\n923\n00:48:23,380 --> 00:48:26,820\nAll right, so\ncouple of caveats with the network side.\n\n924\n00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:31,680\nWe need to make sure we used AFP, and\nthe folder needs to be stored on something\n\n925\n00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:35,750\nthat's formatted with the Mac OS\nextended journaling file system.\n\n926\n00:48:35,750 --> 00:48:38,910\nSo if we have that, we're good to go.\n\n927\n00:48:38,910 --> 00:48:41,460\nThere is a third option that's\nnot covered on the exam,\n\n928\n00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:43,480\nwhich is when you do your backup,\n\n929\n00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:47,900\nyou can actually back up to systems\nthat are called time capsules, right?\n\n930\n00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:51,410\nAnd these are the ones that are attached\nto like our airport wireless devices.\n\n931\n00:48:51,410 --> 00:48:54,990\nSo if you choose to use one of those,\nwhen you hit setup, it's going to launch\n\n932\n00:48:54,990 --> 00:48:58,530\nthe airport utility to try and connect\nout and find one of those to backup.\n\n933\n00:48:58,530 --> 00:49:00,020\nSo that's another option.\n\n934\n00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:02,950\nAnd then theres always iCloud, you know,\nyou can synchronize your data with\n\n935\n00:49:02,950 --> 00:49:07,880\niCloud as a type of backup, but there are\nlimits to what you can place into iCloud.\n\n936\n00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:10,400\nSo lots of different options out there.\n\n937\n00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:14,050\nTime Machine's probably the easiest and\ndefinitely a good one.\n\n938\n00:49:15,590 --> 00:49:16,096\nAll right.\n\n939\n00:49:16,096 --> 00:49:18,700\nSo that's about it for\ndata management and back-up.\n\n940\n00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:20,550\nI don't think I'm leaving\nanything else out.\n\n941\n00:49:20,550 --> 00:49:24,460\nLet me just double check real quick,\nand yeah, that's about it.\n\n942\n00:49:24,460 --> 00:49:28,210\nAll right, so that's about all we've got\non time machine and on migrating our data,\n\n943\n00:49:28,210 --> 00:49:32,310\nso pretty straight forward, should be\na pretty easy section for you on the exam.\n\n944\n00:49:32,310 --> 00:49:35,260\nAll right well, we're gonna wrap this\nepisode up here, so let me just remind you\n\n945\n00:49:35,260 --> 00:49:39,800\nguys, if you have any questions\non any of this, feel free to ask.\n\n946\n00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:42,490\nLive during the show,\nyou can go to itpro.tv/live, and\n\n947\n00:49:42,490 --> 00:49:45,140\nyou'll see the chat box\nright beneath the video.\n\n948\n00:49:45,140 --> 00:49:48,710\nYou can post your questions there, and we\nanswer and sometimes we shoot the breeze.\n\n949\n00:49:48,710 --> 00:49:52,290\nWe were talking about expensive\ncable costs during the break.\n\n950\n00:49:52,290 --> 00:49:54,380\nSo there's the various things there.\n\n951\n00:49:54,380 --> 00:49:58,490\nIf you have questions after the show,\njump into our Q and A forums.\n\n952\n00:49:58,490 --> 00:50:00,920\nIf you hit that Q and\nA link up at the top of

--> 00:00:38,840\nTo another episode of IT Pro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,920\nI'm your host Don Pezet,\n\n5\n00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:45,220\ncoming back at you with another\nepisode of Mac integration basics.\n\n6\n00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:47,630\nNot just another episode,\nbut our final episode.\n\n7\n00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:51,720\nAs we move into our last topic for\nthe exam objectives, and\n\n8\n00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:55,110\nthat is cross platform compatibility.\n\n9\n00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:59,410\nThat's a really long way of saying\nman I just moved over from Windows,\n\n10\n00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:02,340\nnow I'm on a Mac but\nthere's some software that I miss.\n\n11\n00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:07,950\nFor a home user, moving from Windows\nto Mac is really not a big deal right?\n\n12\n00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:11,110\nYour average home user needs\nweb browsing capabilities and\n\n13\n00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:14,286\nsome basic file sharing and\nthat kind of stuff, nothing too crazy.\n\n14\n00:01:14,286 --> 00:01:19,130\nAnd your Mac will do that, so there's\nnot much of a hindrance there at all for\n\n15\n00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:21,830\na home user to jump from\none platform to another.\n\n16\n00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:24,430\nBut in the business world\nit's a different story.\n\n17\n00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:25,370\nIn the business world,\n\n18\n00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:29,190\nif there's a developer out there\nwriting a line of business application,\n\n19\n00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:33,120\nthey're gonna write it for the platform\nthat has the biggest install base.\n\n20\n00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:36,010\nAnd in the business world\nthat's Microsoft Windows.\n\n21\n00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:39,630\nSo there are many applications that\nare available on the Windows platform\n\n22\n00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:42,410\nthat are not available\non the Mac platform.\n\n23\n00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:46,350\nAnd so making that switch in the business\nworld can be very challenging, all right.\n\n24\n00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:47,600\nSo what do we do?\n\n25\n00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,340\nDo we just give up and\nsay alright we'll run Windows forever?\n\n26\n00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:51,690\nNo, we don't have to do that.\n\n27\n00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:55,070\nThere's several different routes\nwe can go to get it where\n\n28\n00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:59,090\nwe can still take advantage of that\nsoftware, even on the Mac platform.\n\n29\n00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:05,220\nNow obviously, the best case scenario is,\nif I had software on the Windows side,\n\n30\n00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:08,560\nhopefully they make that same software\non the Mac side, and more and\n\n31\n00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,770\nmore we're seeing that where\ncompanies make it for both.\n\n32\n00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:16,160\nSo, let's say you really like\nthe Google Chrome web browser.\n\n33\n00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:21,320\nWell, google chrome came out\non Microsoft Windows first.\n\n34\n00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,680\nThat was the first platform\nthey released it for.\n\n35\n00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,470\nThen they released it for\nLinux and Mac OS.\n\n36\n00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:29,450\nSo it did come out on Mac OS and\nit's been out for years now.\n\n37\n00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:30,670\nVery, very popular.\n\n38\n00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:37,750\nSo when I switch from Windows to Mac,\nI just download the Mac version of Chrome.\n\n39\n00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:40,568\nAnd it can be even more complex\napplications than that.\n\n40\n00:02:40,568 --> 00:02:45,320\nApplications like Quicken,\ninto it Quicken.\n\n41\n00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,430\nOr Microsoft Office.\n\n42\n00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:48,770\nThe entire Office suite.\n\n43\n00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:50,290\nMicrosoft has a Mac version.\n\n44\n00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:52,050\nI've got their website\npulled up right here.\n\n45\n00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:55,800\nSo, maybe you're used to\nMicrosoft Word and Microsoft Excel.\n\n46\n00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:01,420\nWell, we have the numbers and\napplications like that on the Mac side.\n\n47\n00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:04,030\nWe have iWork and\nall that that we could use.\n\n48\n00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:06,550\nOr we can just get Microsoft Office for\nMac.\n\n49\n00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:10,080\nIt's Excel, Word, PowerPoint,\nOutlooks and One Note.\n\n50\n00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,960\nThe same applications you run on Windows,\nyou run them on a Mac, right?\n\n51\n00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,340\nSo now that learning curve.\n\n52\n00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:18,080\nThat resistance to jumping over\nto the new platform is gone,\n\n53\n00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,780\nbecause it's the same\napplication that you're used to.\n\n54\n00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:22,350\nThat's really the best solution.\n\n55\n00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:27,240\nIf you can do that If you can\nget a native Mac OS application\n\n56\n00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:30,090\nthat matches the application\nyou have under Windows.\n\n57\n00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:33,720\nThen you get zero resistance from\nthe users, very smooth transition, and\n\n58\n00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,320\noff you go.\n\n59\n00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:37,230\nAnd like I said, more and\nmore we're starting to see that.\n\n60\n00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:42,330\nBut sometimes there are applications\nthat don't run on both platforms.\n\n61\n00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:43,600\nSo for example,\n\n62\n00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:49,096\none of my favorite Windows applications\nis a program called Notepad++.\n\n63\n00:03:49,096 --> 00:03:52,380\nNotepad++, it's a simple text editor.\n\n64\n00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:57,550\nAnd There are many text editors available\non the Mac side, but not this one.\n\n65\n00:03:57,550 --> 00:04:00,100\nNotepad ++ doesn't have a Mac version.\n\n66\n00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:04,120\nAnd on the Mac side the closest ones match\n\n67\n00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:09,290\nthis cost like $80, $90, but\nthis is completely free so\n\n68\n00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:12,330\nI really like this solution, but\nit's not available on the Mac.\n\n69\n00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:13,250\nSo what do I do?\n\n70\n00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:16,110\nWell, you've got a few choices there too.\n\n71\n00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:18,570\nOne, you could find an alternative,\n\n72\n00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:22,100\nsome other kind of software that\nmatches up with what you want.\n\n73\n00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:25,580\nSo, you might talk to some people and\nsay, hey what do you guys use for\n\n74\n00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:26,300\na text editor?\n\n75\n00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,440\nYou could search the App store.\n\n76\n00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,385\nI like this website called alternativeTo.\n\n77\n00:04:30,385 --> 00:04:34,920\nAlternativeTo.net, you go there and\nyou punch in the software that you use.\n\n78\n00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,348\nSo I'm gonna say Notepad++, all right?\n\n79\n00:04:37,348 --> 00:04:39,660\nI use Notepad++ and I like it.\n\n80\n00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:41,580\nSo here it is, Notepad++.\n\n81\n00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:44,880\nAnd then down here it's\ngonna show me alternatives,\n\n82\n00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,600\nother programs that match up.\n\n83\n00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,710\nAnd so I can change that to say,\nyou know what?\n\n84\n00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:52,530\nJust show me Mac OS X or OS10 apps.\n\n85\n00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:56,920\nAnd it's gonna recommend Sublime Text,\nor Vim, gedit, Aptana,\n\n86\n00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,500\nall these different ones, all right?\n\n87\n00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:01,370\nWow, kind of down the list is TextMate,\nthat's the one that I use.\n\n88\n00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:04,080\nSo you'll see like when I have\nmy show notes up on the screen,\n\n89\n00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,100\nI almost always use TextMate.\n\n90\n00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:09,050\nWhich I find gives me\neverything that Notepad++ did,\n\n91\n00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:10,910\nso that's the one that I use.\n\n92\n00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:14,330\nBut here's how we can start to see\nwhat other people are voting for.\n\n93\n00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:17,980\nSublime Text has 609 votes, so\nthat's a pretty good one, right?\n\n94\n00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:22,190\nSo we can go and look at that and see if\nthat's gonna be a good alternative for us.\n\n95\n00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:25,550\nAnd maybe Sublime Text is the choice for\nme.\n\n96\n00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:27,060\nSo we can find that.\n\n97\n00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,490\nNow we have to relearn\nsome software though.\n\n98\n00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:31,080\nAnd so you'll get resistance on this.\n\n99\n00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,870\nYou'll get where people say,\nwell I don't want to learn new software,\n\n100\n00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:36,850\nI was happy with what I had,\nmaybe I'll just stay on Windows.\n\n101\n00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:37,520\nIf you can't,\n\n102\n00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:42,049\nyou know, run my program over on your Mac,\nthen I'll just stick with Windows.\n\n103\n00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:46,320\nOr there may not be an alternative.\n\n104\n00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:50,620\nYou may have a custom application\nthat was written specifically for\n\n105\n00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:53,670\nyour business and\nit was only written for Windows.\n\n106\n00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:55,360\nAnd so, there is no alternative.\n\n107\n00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:00,550\nThat was a custom application and\nto pay a developer to rewrite it as\n\n108\n00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:06,240\na native Mac app, might be prohibitively\nexpensive, just outrageously expensive.\n\n109\n00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,380\nSo, do you just stay on Windows?\n\n110\n00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:10,290\nWell, you could, right?\n\n111\n00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:15,650\nOr you could go ahead and switch over\nto Mac and use virtualization software,\n\n112\n00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:19,700\nto virtualize a Windows environment\nright on top of your Mac.\n\n113\n00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,670\nThere's several programs that\nare out there that do it,\n\n114\n00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:27,010\nthe two main leaders in it\nare Parallels and VMWare.\n\n115\n00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:27,590\nAll right.\n\n116\n00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:31,860\nParallels is a company that makes a\nproduct called Parallels Desktop for Mac.\n\n117\n00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:35,270\nYou install it on your Mac and\nit allows you to run Windows,\n\n118\n00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:37,540\nas a virtual machine, on top of your Mac.\n\n119\n00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:41,920\nVMware has a product called VMware Fusion,\nand\n\n120\n00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:44,780\nit allows you to run Windows on your Mac.\n\n121\n00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:49,430\nIt's the same thing, so\nyou're running your Mac OS, and\n\n122\n00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:51,760\nthen you have a Windows\noperating system on top of it.\n\n123\n00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:55,850\nAnd I've actually been using\nVMware Fusion all throughout this show.\n\n124\n00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:59,423\nEvery time I've brought up a Mac client or\na Windows client or whatever,\n\n125\n00:06:59,423 --> 00:07:02,100\nit's been in my VMWARE Fusion environment.\n\n126\n00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,940\nSo let me show you that one.\n\n127\n00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:07,470\nBecause I have been running it all show,\nbut I hide it.\n\n128\n00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:10,210\nSo here is VMware Fusion.\n\n129\n00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:12,910\nAnd you can see my virtual machines,\nI had others,\n\n130\n00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:14,960\nI've removed them as the show has gone on.\n\n131\n00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,190\nBut I've got a Windows client,\nthat's running Windows 7,\n\n132\n00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:20,100\nand it's kind of parked\nhere in the background.\n\n133\n00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:24,560\nAnd if I pull it up, here it is,\nand I'm still on my Mac, right?\n\n134\n00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,100\nSo I can fire up my app store, right here.\n\n135\n00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:31,740\nAnd I can browse in and\ntake a look at stuff, shop for\n\n136\n00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:34,590\nthe latest angry birds game,\nwhatever it is I'm gonna do.\n\n137\n00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:38,340\nAnd meanwhile I've got this Windows\n7 desk top sitting right here.\n\n138\n00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:45,768\nAnd I can fire it up and I can go\nto the internet and find Notepad++.\n\n139\n00:07:45,768 --> 00:07:48,628\nThere we go.\n\n140\n00:07:48,628 --> 00:07:52,298\nAnd so I can go in and install it and\nrun Notepad++ just like I used to.\n\n141\n00:07:52,298 --> 00:07:52,958\nOkay?\n\n142\n00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:57,960\nNow, on a positive side,\nyou can run any Windows software this way.\n\n143\n00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:02,010\nSo I can run my Windows software\nright here in the virtual machine.\n\n144\n00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:05,990\nOn a negative side,\nit's not the greatest user experience.\n\n145\n00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:09,440\nYour end user now has two machines.\n\n146\n00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,870\nThey've got their Mac and they've\ngot this Windows virtual machine and\n\n147\n00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:14,520\nthey're kind of going back and forth.\n\n148\n00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:19,200\nAnd if they use this application a lot,\nwhat you'll find they end up doing\n\n149\n00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:22,460\nis they'll full screen this\nvirtual machine, right?\n\n150\n00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:26,630\nSo if I take it and\nI full-screen it like this, so\n\n151\n00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:31,280\nif they're always running the Windows\nmachine, they may full screen it and\n\n152\n00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,550\nstart working in it and\nnever go to the Mac desk top.\n\n153\n00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:37,360\nAnd so now, why bother going to a Mac?\n\n154\n00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,768\nYou might as well just stuck with the PC.\n\n155\n00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:42,230\nIf they're gonna run right here in\ntheir Windows environment all the time,\n\n156\n00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:46,360\nyou lose all the benefits\nof going the Mac route.\n\n157\n00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:50,880\nSo, this type of an experience is\nnot a true integrated experience.\n\n158\n00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,090\nIt's really separate.\n\n159\n00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:54,640\nYou've got your Windows virtual machine,\nand you got your Mac.\n\n160\n00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,830\nAnd sure, we can switch back and\nforth between them really easily, right?\n\n161\n00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:01,930\nA little three finger swipe on the touch\npad will move between those, but\n\n162\n00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:03,290\nit is not the same.\n\n163\n00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:07,200\nIt's not the same as having one platform,\nall right?\n\n164\n00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,720\nWell, both Parallels and\n\n165\n00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:14,160\nVMware Fusion support an integrated view\nand they have different names for it.\n\n166\n00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,630\nVMware calls theirs the Unity View.\n\n167\n00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:19,450\nIf I go into the Unity View,\nwhich I'm gonna click this button here,\n\n168\n00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:23,130\nand I'll minimize some\nof this other stuff.\n\n169\n00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:28,250\nWhen I go into Unity view, it actually\ntakes my Windows applications and\n\n170\n00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:33,505\nmakes them appear as if they\nwere native Mac applications.\n\n171\n00:09:33,505 --> 00:09:36,945\nSo here's my App Store,\nhere's Notepad++, and\n\n172\n00:09:36,945 --> 00:09:41,355\nit looks like I'm running\nNotepad++ right on my Mac.\n\n173\n00:09:41,355 --> 00:09:44,915\nAnd so now, I've got one user experience.\n\n174\n00:09:44,915 --> 00:09:47,215\nI see my Mac, I see its applications,\n\n175\n00:09:47,215 --> 00:09:51,210\nI see my Windows applications running\nside by side In one interface.\n\n176\n00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:52,790\nThat's a better solution.\n\n177\n00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:56,680\nNow you could have your line of business\napplication running right beside your\n\n178\n00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:01,020\nMac applications, and the user has that\none user interface they deal with.\n\n179\n00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:06,106\nWith VMware, the way it works is you get\nthis little VMware icon up here, and if\n\n180\n00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:10,391\nyou click on it, it basically brings down\nthe Start Menu for your Windows machine.\n\n181\n00:10:10,391 --> 00:10:15,407\nAnd so there's Notepad++, and\nI can fire up Internet Explorer,\n\n182\n00:10:15,407 --> 00:10:19,960\nand now I'm running Internet Explorer\nas a window on my Mac.\n\n183\n00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:24,240\nSo it looks like I'm running the crappiest\nweb browser ever right here on my Mac.\n\n184\n00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,560\nWhich, if you're a web developer you\nneed Internet Explorer just to do\n\n185\n00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,880\ntesting to make sure your page is\ncompatible, so you might have that.\n\n186\n00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:35,070\nAnd now we can just browse around,\nhit the Internet.\n\n187\n00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:41,000\nIt's running kinda slow for me, but browse\nthe Internet, do whatever it is we need,\n\n188\n00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:47,070\nand do it in what seems like our regular\nenvironment, although considerably slower.\n\n189\n00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:48,270\nI'm not sure what I've done to this thing.\n\n190\n00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:52,610\nHere, we'll just try like Google News or\nsomething.\n\n191\n00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:54,810\nI think it's just running incredibly slow.\n\n192\n00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:57,060\nAll right, well,\nwe don't have to wait on that.\n\n193\n00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,200\nSo we can fire it up and\n\n194\n00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,040\nuse it, browse around,\ndo whatever we need, and there we go.\n\n195\n00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,710\nSo that's kind of cool stuff.\n\n196\n00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:04,280\nIt is third party software.\n\n197\n00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,920\nNeither Parallels or\nVMWare Fusion is free.\n\n198\n00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:13,061\nBoth of them cost money, but\nthey kind of solve part of that issue.\n\n199\n00:11:13,061 --> 00:11:14,441\nThe other options, so\n\n200\n00:11:14,441 --> 00:11:18,884\nwhat we talked about finding a native\nversion of our app that runs on Mac.\n\n201\n00:11:18,884 --> 00:11:22,647\nWe're talking about finding alternative\nsoftware, just some other software that\n\n202\n00:11:22,647 --> 00:11:26,920\ndoes the same thing that we can relearn,\nand now I've talked about virtualization.\n\n203\n00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:30,240\nAnd so with virtualization,\nwe're running Windows on top of our Mac.\n\n204\n00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:34,320\nThere is another option for us.\n\n205\n00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,820\nAnd that option is called Boot Camp.\n\n206\n00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:42,650\nYou might have an application that\nis a Windows-only application, and\n\n207\n00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:44,590\nyou can run it in a virtual machine.\n\n208\n00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:49,220\nBut, one of the problems with virtual\nmachines, is you don't get the same\n\n209\n00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:53,920\nperformance as you do when you run\nthe software on actual hardware.\n\n210\n00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:58,560\nWhen you run the software in a virtual\nmachine, it's seeing a virtual processor,\n\n211\n00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,090\nvirtual memory, a virtual hard drive.\n\n212\n00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:04,280\nAnd so every time they write to memory,\nevery time they write to the hard drive,\n\n213\n00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,270\nevery time they talk to the CPU,\n\n214\n00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:09,920\nyour virtualization software\nhas to translate that and\n\n215\n00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:13,520\nsend it to the physical processor, send it\nto the physical memory, and vice versa.\n\n216\n00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:16,750\nSo, you've got this little software\napplication sitting in between\n\n217\n00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:19,960\nevery read and write operation that's\ngoing on inside of your virtual machine,\n\n218\n00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,340\nand that results in slower performance.\n\n219\n00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:26,400\nNow, for something like Notepad++,\nI'll probably never notice it.\n\n220\n00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:30,340\nBut, in something like Internet Explorer,\nthat might have accelerated\n\n221\n00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:33,630\ngraphic support for\nsmooth scrolling, we notice it.\n\n222\n00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:35,810\nWe start to notice these\nperformance degradations.\n\n223\n00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:38,990\nIf you're running something like\nAutoCAD or Adobe Photoshop, or\n\n224\n00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:41,410\nwhatever, if you get a native Mac version,\n\n225\n00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:43,900\nit's running right on your hardware,\nit runs super fast.\n\n226\n00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:46,890\nIf you run it in a virtual machine,\nit starts to run slower.\n\n227\n00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:55,050\nSo, what would be nice is if we could do\na dual boot type solution on our device.\n\n228\n00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:59,230\nSo when I boot up my laptop,\nit normally boots right into Mac OS.\n\n229\n00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:01,940\nBut, we could set up\na dual boot situation,\n\n230\n00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:06,060\nwhere instead of booting to Mac OS,\nI could choose to boot to Windows.\n\n231\n00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:10,170\nAnd then I'm running Windows\nright on my Apple hardware.\n\n232\n00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:12,730\nThat way,\nmy applications can run at native speed.\n\n233\n00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:16,850\nThey run at full hardware speed,\nbecause I'm running Windows on the Mac.\n\n234\n00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:18,910\nNow, you used to not be able to do that.\n\n235\n00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:22,830\nMacs used to ship with PowerPC processors,\nor PPCs.\n\n236\n00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:28,540\nThey changed to Intel years ago now, and\nso all the Macs that are going out today\n\n237\n00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:31,690\nhave Intel processors,\nwhich is what Windows runs on too, so\n\n238\n00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:35,100\nyou can run the Windows\noperating system on your Mac.\n\n239\n00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:39,580\nDon't normally have a need for that, but\nif you've got an application that requires\n\n240\n00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:42,670\nthat extra boost,\nyou might choose to do it.\n\n241\n00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:46,130\nI do it on mine normally, just because\nsometimes I'm doing a Mac show,\n\n242\n00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:47,580\nsometimes I'm doing a Windows show.\n\n243\n00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:50,680\nAnd on a Windows show, I don't wanna\nhave people seeing a Mac desktop.\n\n244\n00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:54,060\nAnd so I'll boot to a Windows\nenvironment and run from there.\n\n245\n00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:58,910\nSo it just kinda depends on your use\ncase scenario, how it works for you.\n\n246\n00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:00,390\nNow even if you don't care about that,\n\n247\n00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:03,090\nif you don't want to run Windows\nin your machine, that's fine.\n\n248\n00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:06,200\nBut it's on the exam, so we need to\nbe familiar with how to set that up.\n\n249\n00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,730\nAnd Apple makes it really easy for us.\n\n250\n00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:10,625\nApple has what's called Boot Camp.\n\n251\n00:14:10,625 --> 00:14:14,160\nAnd let me get out of Internet Explorer,\nand all this other stuff.\n\n252\n00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:19,299\nIn fact let me just get out of\n\n253\n00:14:19,299 --> 00:14:24,680\nVMware Fusion altogether.\n\n254\n00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:27,540\nIt's easy to get lost in the various\nvirtual machines when you have\n\n255\n00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:29,080\ntoo many of them.\n\n256\n00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,752\nI need to cheat this real quick.\n\n257\n00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:36,709\nAll right, so\nI'm just gonna get rid of all that.\n\n258\n00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:40,273\nAll right, so boot camp,\nit's a part of Mac OS, and\n\n259\n00:14:40,273 --> 00:14:43,849\nit's a part of any hardware\nthat you buy from Apple.\n\n260\n00:14:43,849 --> 00:14:49,150\nAnd it's a quick and easy way to\nget Windows running on your Mac.\n\n261\n00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:51,950\nBasically, you've got an Intel processor.\n\n262\n00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:53,610\nThat's great,\nWindows already supports that.\n\n263\n00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:55,900\nBut you've got a lot\nof other hardware too.\n\n264\n00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:58,230\nYou've got a Retina Display, right?\n\n265\n00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,850\nAnd Windows PCs don't\nhave Retina Displays.\n\n266\n00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:04,530\nAnd you've got touch pads with\nall sorts of gesture support.\n\n267\n00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:06,500\nMost Windows machines don't have that.\n\n268\n00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:11,300\nSo, you've got a lot of different hardware\nthat Windows doesn't have support for.\n\n269\n00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:12,090\nThunderbolt, right?\n\n270\n00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:14,990\nThunderbolt ports you rarely\nsee support for in Windows.\n\n271\n00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:18,710\nSo, what Apple did is they\nput together a neat system.\n\n272\n00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:20,950\nThey have what's called\nthe Boot Camp Wizard.\n\n273\n00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:24,620\nIt's a wizard we run through,\nthat will allow you to create\n\n274\n00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:27,920\na partition on your hard drive\nthat you can install Windows to.\n\n275\n00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:32,320\nAnd when you boot up, you can boot\nto Mac OS, or boot to Windows.\n\n276\n00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,980\nAnd then they put together\na set of support software.\n\n277\n00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:38,661\nThe support software\nare all the drivers and\n\n278\n00:15:38,661 --> 00:15:43,460\nother utilities we need to get Windows\nto play nicely with our Apple hardware.\n\n279\n00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:46,750\nAnd so\nthat support software gets installed, and\n\n280\n00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:50,130\nthen you can run Windows\nwithout issue on your Mac.\n\n281\n00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:51,170\nIt works really well.\n\n282\n00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:52,920\nI've done it many times.\n\n283\n00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:56,300\nAnd so, I definitely want to show you guys\nhow to do it on the show for two reasons.\n\n284\n00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:59,414\nOne, you might use it in real life,\nand two, it's on the exam,\n\n285\n00:15:59,414 --> 00:16:01,450\nso we need to know how to do it.\n\n286\n00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:02,190\nAll right?\n\n287\n00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:05,880\nWell, one of the first things you want\nto do if you're going to use Boot Camp\n\n288\n00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,280\nis to do your software updates.\n\n289\n00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,946\nYou gotta do your software updates.\n\n290\n00:16:09,946 --> 00:16:14,883\nBecause, Apple is constantly updating\nBoot Camp to correct for new hardware,\n\n291\n00:16:14,883 --> 00:16:19,780\nnew updates from Microsoft,\nnew operating systems, things like that.\n\n292\n00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:22,060\nSo, you've got to make sure\nyou do your software updates.\n\n293\n00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:25,140\nThe other thing is you've\ngot to backup your machine.\n\n294\n00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:27,280\nYou don't have to, but you should.\n\n295\n00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,580\nYou should back it up, and\n\n296\n00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:31,290\nthe reason is we're going to\nbe repartitioning the drive.\n\n297\n00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:36,590\nWe've got to shrink our Mac partition\non the hard drive to make room for\n\n298\n00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:38,070\na Windows partition.\n\n299\n00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:40,350\nAnd, we need that, cuz that's where\nwe're gonna install Windows to.\n\n300\n00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:43,420\nAnd, anytime you resize\na partition on a hard drive,\n\n301\n00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:46,040\nthere's always a chance\nyou could lose some data.\n\n302\n00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:50,890\nSo, make sure you've got a good backup\nof your system before you get started.\n\n303\n00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:55,620\nOnce that's done, so\nyou've backed up your system, and\n\n304\n00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:57,540\nyou've done your software updates.\n\n305\n00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:01,321\nThe next thing we do is we\nrun the Boot Camp wizard.\n\n306\n00:17:01,321 --> 00:17:04,360\nAnd, it's gonna run\nthrough some simple steps.\n\n307\n00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:07,550\nThrough those steps,\nit's gonna download the support utilities,\n\n308\n00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:09,860\nit's gonna grab your Windows install, and\n\n309\n00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:12,630\nit's gonna kick off the process\nof getting Boot Camp set up.\n\n310\n00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:17,670\nSo, if I'm going to started, there's\na few things I need to get together.\n\n311\n00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:20,110\nSo, I do my backups,\nI do my software updates.\n\n312\n00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:25,320\nNext, I need an installation image for\nWindows.\n\n313\n00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:28,550\nSo, Microsoft Windows normally\nships on a CD or DVD.\n\n314\n00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:30,420\nIt's all on a DVD now.\n\n315\n00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:34,950\nAnd, we need to have an image of that,\nan ISO image that has the install ready.\n\n316\n00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:38,550\nSo, if you're a Microsoft Enterprise\ncustomer, they make those where you\n\n317\n00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:41,039\ndownload them right off the website,\nand you can get the ISO image.\n\n318\n00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:45,770\nThe second thing I need\nis either a blank CD, or\n\n319\n00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:49,005\nDVD, or a USB hard drive that I can use.\n\n320\n00:17:49,005 --> 00:17:51,357\nBecause that support software,\n\n321\n00:17:51,357 --> 00:17:57,310\nwe need the support software to install\nin our new Windows operating system.\n\n322\n00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:58,700\nBut, when we download\nthe support software,\n\n323\n00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:01,340\nit's gonna download right here on our Mac.\n\n324\n00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:05,950\nMy Mac hard drive is formatted with the\nMac OS extended journaling file system.\n\n325\n00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:07,380\nWindows can't read that.\n\n326\n00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:11,370\nSo, Windows won't be able to see\nthe support files to install them.\n\n327\n00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:15,830\nSo, to get the install going, I'm going\nto need to copy those support files\n\n328\n00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:20,630\nto a CD or DVD, that can be formatted,\nand allow a Windows machine to see it.\n\n329\n00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:24,700\nOr, a USB hard drive that also can be\nformatted to allow Windows to see it.\n\n330\n00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:28,440\nSo, I normally use a USB hard drive for\nthis, so\n\n331\n00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,660\nI get that hooked up, and\nget the installer running from there.\n\n332\n00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:37,540\nOnce that's going,\nwe launch our Boot Camp Assistant.\n\n333\n00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:41,390\nIt sees our Windows ISO,\nour installation image.\n\n334\n00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:44,090\nIt sees the support files\nthat it downloaded.\n\n335\n00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:47,890\nIt re-partitions our drive, and\nit gets things set up and reboots.\n\n336\n00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:51,140\nAnd, when it reboots,\nit starts a full Windows install.\n\n337\n00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:52,462\nAnd, I wanna show that to you guys.\n\n338\n00:18:52,462 --> 00:18:55,860\nI wanna show you the whole process, cuz\nyou might not want to do this on your own\n\n339\n00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:57,590\nMac, so we'll make mine the guinea pig.\n\n340\n00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:59,040\nI'll show it to you here.\n\n341\n00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:02,770\nBut, I've gotta switch to that other\ncamera angle, because I'm gonna have to\n\n342\n00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:05,510\nreboot a few times, and\nyou won't be able to see it here normally.\n\n343\n00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:08,059\nSo, we're gonna have to\nswitch to our sky cam, so\n\n344\n00:19:08,059 --> 00:19:11,113\nwhat I'm gonna do is I'm gonna\ndo that in the next segment.\n\n345\n00:19:11,113 --> 00:19:14,410\nWe'll have to get my laptop set up for\nthat.\n\n346\n00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:16,520\nBut we'll have to get a couple\nof other things together too,\n\n347\n00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,680\njust to be able to show this.\n\n348\n00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:20,720\nSo, I've gotta get my Windows\ninstall image, and so on.\n\n349\n00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,450\nAnd, I guess something I left out,\n\n350\n00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:27,710\nBoot Camp supports booting\nWindows from your hardware.\n\n351\n00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:31,100\nIt supports Windows 7 and Windows 8, so\n\n352\n00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:34,590\nif you wanna do Windows 8 or\n8.1, whatever, you can do that.\n\n353\n00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:37,410\nIf you wanna do Windows 7,\nwhich is more common, you can do that too.\n\n354\n00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:38,760\nSo, it has support for both.\n\n355\n00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:42,770\nAll right, so let's do this.\n\n356\n00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:43,710\nLet's stop here.\n\n357\n00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:44,910\nWe'll take a break.\n\n358\n00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:47,883\nAnd, during the break, we'll get our\ncameras kind of rearranged, and stuff so\n\n359\n00:19:47,883 --> 00:19:50,655\nI can show you my laptop, and then you\ncan kind of run through that process.\n\n360\n00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:54,880\nAnd, we'll get a chance to\nsee Boot Camp in action.\n\n361\n00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:59,492\nSo, stay tuned, we'll be back after this.\n\n362\n00:19:59,492 --> 00:20:02,698\n[SOUND] All right,\n\n363\n00:20:02,698 --> 00:20:07,405\nwelcome back everybody.\n\n364\n00:20:07,405 --> 00:20:09,110\nIt's time to take the plunge.\n\n365\n00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:12,750\nNow, what we're gonna do is\nwe're gonna use my laptop here.\n\n366\n00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:16,980\nAnd, I'm currently running Mac OS,\nI'm running 10.9 Mavericks.\n\n367\n00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:23,170\nAnd, I wanna add a Boot Camp partition,\nso that I can boot off of Windows 8.\n\n368\n00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:27,430\nSo, I thought about the things\nthat I need to get ahead of time.\n\n369\n00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:30,400\nI've got my USB hard drive here,\nso that says DPEZET_USB.\n\n370\n00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:35,400\nI've also got my Windows 8 installation\n\n371\n00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,490\nimage that I downloaded from Microsoft,\nso I've got it right there.\n\n372\n00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:42,210\nIf you have a physical disc, you can use\nsoftware to make an image, there's plenty\n\n373\n00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:45,690\nof disc imaging software out there, or\nyou can even use disc utility to do it.\n\n374\n00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:48,730\nBut here,\nI downloaded it right from Microsoft.\n\n375\n00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:51,090\nSo now, I'm ready to get started.\n\n376\n00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:55,360\nSo, I'm going to fire up\nmy Boot Camp Assistant.\n\n377\n00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:59,870\nI'll just use Spotlight here, it's\nactually buried under Applications and\n\n378\n00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:01,460\nUtilities.\n\n379\n00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:04,710\nI'll fire up the Boot Camp Assistant,\nand it's going to warn me about some of\n\n380\n00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:06,580\nthe things I've mentioned\nin the earlier segment.\n\n381\n00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:10,830\nFor example, you really need to\nbackup your disk before you do this.\n\n382\n00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:13,815\nSo, make sure you got that good\nbackup before you jump through here,\n\n383\n00:21:13,815 --> 00:21:16,760\ncuz there's always a possibility\nwe could mess things up.\n\n384\n00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:23,700\nThough, the main thing being, if I go into\nmy Disk Utility, here's my Macintosh HD.\n\n385\n00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:28,480\nI've got a 500 gig hard drive,\nand it's got one partition on it.\n\n386\n00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,980\nThat's my Macintosh HD right there,\n\n387\n00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:33,680\nit's a 500 gig partition,\nit's filling the whole drive.\n\n388\n00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:37,570\nAs part of the Boot Camp install,\nit's going to shrink this.\n\n389\n00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:42,000\nIt’s going to shrink the partition to\nmake some empty space where we can put\n\n390\n00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,350\nthe Windows install.\n\n391\n00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:45,910\nSo, anytime we mess with\nthe partition like that,\n\n392\n00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:47,480\nthere's a chance we could lose data.\n\n393\n00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,350\nSo, that's why we gotta make\nsure we've got that backed up.\n\n394\n00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:53,720\nSo, I'll go ahead and hit Continue,\nand now it's gonna ask what I'm doing.\n\n395\n00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:58,380\nSo, do I wanna create a Windows 7 or\nlater version install disc?\n\n396\n00:21:58,380 --> 00:21:59,800\nYes I do.\n\n397\n00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:04,800\nI've got my ISO, but that's not gonna help\nme much when I reboot to do my install.\n\n398\n00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,950\nSo, it's going to take\nthe files from the ISO and\n\n399\n00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:11,100\ncopy that over to make it ready for\nmy installer.\n\n400\n00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:15,180\nAnd then, we'll see actually\ninstalled Windows 7, or later.\n\n401\n00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:16,340\nNotice there's another check mark here.\n\n402\n00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:19,910\nIt says download the latest\nWindows Support software from Apple,\n\n403\n00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:21,380\nand it's checked.\n\n404\n00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:22,860\nI can't uncheck it.\n\n405\n00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:26,390\nWell, the reason is that's part\nof this creative a Windows 7 or\n\n406\n00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:28,040\nlater version install disc.\n\n407\n00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:32,670\nIf you check that, it will automatically\ndownload the latest files.\n\n408\n00:22:32,670 --> 00:22:36,740\nIf you uncheck that, you could\nchoose to download them yourself.\n\n409\n00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:40,480\nAnd, then you can install Windows 7 or\nlater by actually booting off of the disc.\n\n410\n00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:43,230\nIt's up to you how you\nwant to go about it.\n\n411\n00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:47,070\nIf you do download it,\nI downloaded it here in the background.\n\n412\n00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:48,820\nNow, I've got it sitting right here.\n\n413\n00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:50,678\nIt's about 800 megs in size.\n\n414\n00:22:50,678 --> 00:22:51,580\nOh, nope, I'm lying.\n\n415\n00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:54,880\nIt is 925 megs in size,\na bit bigger than I remember it.\n\n416\n00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:59,410\nSo, it's a decent sized file,\nit may take a little while to download.\n\n417\n00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:02,090\nIf you let the wizard do it then\nit's gonna have to download that.\n\n418\n00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:06,760\nNow, it's in my opinion, best to let\nthe wizard do the download for you,\n\n419\n00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,500\nand there's a reason for that.\n\n420\n00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:14,900\nThe Windows support software is different\nbased on which Apple device you have.\n\n421\n00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,590\nSo, if I go to Apple's website,\n\n422\n00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:21,530\nhere's where we can download\nthe Boot Camp Support Software.\n\n423\n00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:25,488\nAnd this is the most recent version,\nthis 5.1.5640.\n\n424\n00:23:25,488 --> 00:23:29,260\nAnd, if you want to get here, the easiest\nway is to just do like a Google search.\n\n425\n00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:37,860\nIf you do a Google search for\nBoot Camp Support Software, there we go.\n\n426\n00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:39,690\nThat'll take you into Apple's site.\n\n427\n00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:44,670\nAnd, we can go into that Boot Camp page,\nand you have your downloads.\n\n428\n00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:48,456\nAnd, inside of the downloads notice\nhow there's two versions right here,\n\n429\n00:23:48,456 --> 00:23:49,830\nof that support software.\n\n430\n00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:51,339\nWell newer laptops and\n\n431\n00:23:51,339 --> 00:23:56,670\ndesktops from Apple have different\nsupport software than the older ones.\n\n432\n00:23:56,670 --> 00:24:00,340\nSo, if I choose the new one, what I\ndownloaded, you'll see in the notes here.\n\n433\n00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:04,550\nIt will say, if you're using\none of the Macs listed below,\n\n434\n00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:07,560\nyou should use the older software and\nthen it lists quite the selection.\n\n435\n00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:12,230\nNow, I have a 13 inch Mac book pro with\na retina screen so that's like this one.\n\n436\n00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:17,780\nBut see how it says early 2013,\nmine's the late 2013 model.\n\n437\n00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:20,480\nWell, not everybody knows\nwhether they've got the early or\n\n438\n00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,740\nthe later,\nwhether there even was an early or a late.\n\n439\n00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,710\nSo, you might not know, and\nif you click on the other one,\n\n440\n00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:32,310\nhere it's got that Mac Book Pro Retina\n13 inch, late 2013, that's my model.\n\n441\n00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:34,650\nSo, if I know that,\nI can go and download it.\n\n442\n00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:37,520\nBut, if you don't know,\nyou could get the wrong one.\n\n443\n00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,940\nSo, letting the wizard download it.\n\n444\n00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:43,830\nLetting this Bootcamp assistant download\nit will ensure that you get the right one.\n\n445\n00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:44,850\nAnd so that's what I normally do.\n\n446\n00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:48,100\nAll right, we move forward.\n\n447\n00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:51,390\nIt's then gonna ask me\nwhere my ISO image is.\n\n448\n00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:55,750\nAnd so I'm gonna choose one and\nI just stuck mine right on my desktop.\n\n449\n00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:56,940\nYou can have it wherever.\n\n450\n00:24:57,940 --> 00:24:59,130\nSo, here's my WIndows 8.1 image.\n\n451\n00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:03,600\nI'm gonna go ahead and select that,\nand it's asking what I want to use for\n\n452\n00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,750\nmy installation disc, all right.\n\n453\n00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:09,960\nNow, it picked up my USB drive, and\nit's warning me, it will be lost,\n\n454\n00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:12,720\nbecause it's going to format the drive.\n\n455\n00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,960\nIf I go back into my disc utility.\n\n456\n00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,950\nI don't remember what I have that drive\nformatted, so I'm just going to look in\n\n457\n00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:22,790\nhere and I can see that my drive is\nformatted Mac OS extended journal.\n\n458\n00:25:23,938 --> 00:25:27,200\nThat's not gonna work for Windows, so\nit's going to format that drive, and\n\n459\n00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,970\nI'm gonna lose the information on it.\n\n460\n00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:33,890\nOnce it formats it, it's going to copy all\nthe Windows installation files to it and\n\n461\n00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:37,400\nit's gonna copy the support\nsoftware over to it also.\n\n462\n00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:40,242\nSo I'll hit continue so\nit can start that process.\n\n463\n00:25:40,242 --> 00:25:43,180\nAll right, it's just warning me one\nmore time that that drives it gonna\n\n464\n00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:45,890\nbe erased and I'll hit continue and\nthere it goes.\n\n465\n00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:48,560\nNow while it's formating\nthat drive will disappear\n\n466\n00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:51,480\nnow it's actually repositioning it and\nformatting it.\n\n467\n00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:55,090\nYou may get prompted to use that disk for\nboot camp.\n\n468\n00:25:55,090 --> 00:25:57,350\nYou need to make sure,\nI mean not boot camp, time machine.\n\n469\n00:25:57,350 --> 00:26:02,660\nSo you need to make sure you say, Don't\nUse so it doesn't mess with it, right.\n\n470\n00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:04,320\nWhile it's working with the drive,\n\n471\n00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:07,080\nit's really important that\nyou don't mess with it.\n\n472\n00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:10,050\nDon't try an browse into the drive and\nsee whats in there,\n\n473\n00:26:10,050 --> 00:26:11,160\ndon't do anything like that.\n\n474\n00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,290\nBecause it could mess\nup the copy operation.\n\n475\n00:26:13,290 --> 00:26:16,180\nSo, that's what it's doing right right\nnow, it's formatting the drive, and\n\n476\n00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:19,520\nnotice what it's called it,\nit's called it Win Install.\n\n477\n00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,620\nIt's gonna have my installation files for\nWindows on there, but\n\n478\n00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:26,010\nit's also going to have\nthe support files copied over too.\n\n479\n00:26:27,050 --> 00:26:28,510\nSo it'll take it a little while.\n\n480\n00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:30,960\nSee how it still says\nformatting selected drive?\n\n481\n00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,940\nIt's really already done formatting,\nand, or actually is it?\n\n482\n00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:38,440\nThe drive disappeared and\nreappeared again, am I bumping it?\n\n483\n00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,330\n[LAUGH] I might be doing\nsomething dumb here.\n\n484\n00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:43,170\nThere we go, so\nnow it's copying the files over and\n\n485\n00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:48,420\nif you've got a thunderbolt or a USB\nthree connection, it'll go pretty quick.\n\n486\n00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:51,350\nIf you're doing USB two\nthis can take a while.\n\n487\n00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:54,790\nThe Windows installation is normally\naround 3 gigs in size, and so\n\n488\n00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:57,210\nthat can take a while to copy\nover a USB two connection.\n\n489\n00:26:59,022 --> 00:27:02,090\nAll right, while I'm waiting on that\nI'm gonna go back into my disk utility.\n\n490\n00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:08,480\nAnd in my Disk Utility, I can come in here\nand I see that Win Install right there,\n\n491\n00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,680\nand notice that it's\nformatted MS-DOS FAT32.\n\n492\n00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:16,810\nFAT32 means that it won't be able\nto hold files over 2 GB in size.\n\n493\n00:27:17,810 --> 00:27:21,360\nYou can have way more that\ntwo gigs of files, but\n\n494\n00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:26,060\nno one file can be over two gigs in size,\nthat's the limit it's imposed.\n\n495\n00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:30,495\nSo I could have 100 gigs of data, but no\none file would be over two gigs in size.\n\n496\n00:27:30,495 --> 00:27:33,945\nWell the Windows installation I mentioned\nearlier was like 3 gigs in size.\n\n497\n00:27:33,945 --> 00:27:34,825\nSo how does that work?\n\n498\n00:27:34,825 --> 00:27:37,005\nWell it's actually un-archiving it.\n\n499\n00:27:37,005 --> 00:27:39,785\nThat installation contains\nthousands of files.\n\n500\n00:27:39,785 --> 00:27:42,725\nSo it's just breaking them up into those\nindividual files and copying them over.\n\n501\n00:27:42,725 --> 00:27:44,227\nSo there are they're all very small.\n\n502\n00:27:44,227 --> 00:27:48,447\nI think the largest file actually ends up\nbeing something like 70 megs or something,\n\n503\n00:27:48,447 --> 00:27:49,977\nso it's not very big at all.\n\n504\n00:27:49,977 --> 00:27:53,247\nThe support files we saw all\nready were about 900 megs, so\n\n505\n00:27:53,247 --> 00:27:54,677\nthat falls within that limit too.\n\n506\n00:27:54,677 --> 00:27:57,332\nSo it works fine doing FAT32.\n\n507\n00:27:57,332 --> 00:28:02,990\nAll right, so\nit's gonna copy those files over,\n\n508\n00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:07,870\nand when it's done, then it's gonna move\non to the partitioning phase, right.\n\n509\n00:28:07,870 --> 00:28:11,110\nWe have to have this done, cuz that's what\nwe're gonna boot off of to do the install.\n\n510\n00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:13,570\nBut, once it's done,\nwe're ready to partition, and it's gonna\n\n511\n00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:18,220\nask me how much hard drive space I want\nto allocate to the Windows install.\n\n512\n00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:23,260\nI have a 500 gig drive I can\nchoose to give as little or\n\n513\n00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:25,260\nas much to Windows as I want.\n\n514\n00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:27,850\nIf I'm just running Windows\nbecause of one application,\n\n515\n00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:30,370\nI probably don't need all that much space.\n\n516\n00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:33,030\nAs a general rule of thumb,\nyou want to allow\n\n517\n00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:37,820\nabout 30 gigs of hard drive space just for\nthe operating system for Windows.\n\n518\n00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:41,890\nAll right, so\nplan on your application after that.\n\n519\n00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:45,450\nI normally do 40 gigs to 100 or even more.\n\n520\n00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:48,560\nIf you're gonna install like Steam and\ndo video gaming, you might want to\n\n521\n00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,430\nassign a couple of hundred gigs to\nallow for the games to be stored.\n\n522\n00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:53,820\nBut if you're running a line\nof business application,\n\n523\n00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:59,290\nyou probably won't need much more\nthan 50 gigs or something like that.\n\n524\n00:28:59,290 --> 00:29:01,360\nMaybe I'll pick 64 gigs,\ncuz it's a nice round binary number.\n\n525\n00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:04,520\nSo we'll do that.\n\n526\n00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:07,800\nNow it is copying those files, I do have a\nUSB three drive which is pretty quick but\n\n527\n00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,100\nit does seem to be taking a while.\n\n528\n00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:13,730\nSo, let's do this, let's take\nadvantage of the magic of television.\n\n529\n00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:18,150\nWait, the instant I say something it\njust switched from copying software\n\n530\n00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:20,710\nto downloading Windows support software.\n\n531\n00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:25,380\nWhat it's doing now is it's copied over\nall the Windows installation stuff.\n\n532\n00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:28,750\nNow it's reaching out to the internet and\ndownloading that support software, and\n\n533\n00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:33,110\nyou know it's downloading the right stuff\nas supposed to if we had done it we might\n\n534\n00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:35,710\nhave picked incorrectly, right,\nand got the wrong version.\n\n535\n00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:39,240\nSo it's gonna do that and\nit's gonna copy this USB drive also.\n\n536\n00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:44,430\nThe last thing it does is it blesses\nthe drive to that partition, so\n\n537\n00:29:44,430 --> 00:29:45,930\nit will be able to boot off of it.\n\n538\n00:29:45,930 --> 00:29:49,090\nCuz when we reboot, we're gonna\nhave to boot off of that drive to\n\n539\n00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:52,350\ndo the installation, so\nthat's what it's doing right now.\n\n540\n00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:54,505\nNow, I don't I don't know how\nlong that download is gonna take.\n\n541\n00:29:55,545 --> 00:29:57,175\nWe're on a 40-megabit connection here,\n\n542\n00:29:57,175 --> 00:29:59,245\nbut it's also Apple's\nservers that are in the mix,\n\n543\n00:29:59,245 --> 00:30:02,215\nand they get a lot of people downloading,\nso we may have to wait for that.\n\n544\n00:30:02,215 --> 00:30:05,155\nNow it's actually safe for me to browse\ninto that disk and look at it, though, so\n\n545\n00:30:05,155 --> 00:30:07,760\nlet's take a look and see what's in there.\n\n546\n00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,540\nWhen I browse into that disc,\n\n547\n00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:12,930\nthe most important folder is\nthis EFI folder right here.\n\n548\n00:30:12,930 --> 00:30:16,890\nWhen your Mac reboots,\nit's gonna look to that EFI folder and\n\n549\n00:30:16,890 --> 00:30:19,510\nthat's where it's gonna find\nthe Microsoft boot loader\n\n550\n00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:23,070\nthat's going to allow it to launch\nthe Windows Installer, right.\n\n551\n00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:25,790\nThat's one of the most\nimportant things that it does.\n\n552\n00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:29,180\nAfter that it's gonna reach into,\nlet's see,\n\n553\n00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:34,070\nsources and\nin here is a file called install.win.\n\n554\n00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:35,470\nThat guy right there.\n\n555\n00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:41,090\nSo it's gonna grab that file to be able\nto actually perform the install and\n\n556\n00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:43,020\nget everything loaded onto our system.\n\n557\n00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:46,850\nSo that's basically the process that's\ngonna happen as it moves through and\n\n558\n00:30:46,850 --> 00:30:47,550\ndoes that boot up.\n\n559\n00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:51,550\nSo that's what it did and then it's now\ncreating this folder called Support and\n\n560\n00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:55,580\nit's gonna drop in that support software,\n\n561\n00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:58,090\nthe Windows support software as\nsoon as it's done downloading.\n\n562\n00:30:58,090 --> 00:31:00,720\nI think it actually downloads\nto our hard drive first and\n\n563\n00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,550\nthen copies it across\nthe wire to the other side.\n\n564\n00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:06,640\nSo that softwares not there yet\nbut it will be.\n\n565\n00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:10,480\nAll right so this is that part where I\ndebate, if I'm say I'm gonna stop and\n\n566\n00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,965\ntake a break then it's all\nof a sudden gonna finish.\n\n567\n00:31:12,965 --> 00:31:17,560\n[LAUGH] All right let's do this, we're\ntake advantage of the magic of television\n\n568\n00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:20,730\nand do a TV time out while\nthis finishes downloading, and\n\n569\n00:31:20,730 --> 00:31:24,530\nthen as soon as it's done we'll pick back\nup and get a chance to see the partition.\n\n570\n00:31:24,530 --> 00:31:28,178\nAll right, so stay tuned we'll\nbe back in just a few seconds.\n\n571\n00:31:28,178 --> 00:31:33,436\n[SOUND] All right,\n\n572\n00:31:33,436 --> 00:31:37,295\nthere we go.\n\n573\n00:31:37,295 --> 00:31:39,630\nSo just waiting for\nthat admin window to pop up.\n\n574\n00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:42,030\nSo now it's done copying\nthat over to the drive and\n\n575\n00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:44,670\nit's just asking to create\nit's little helper tool.\n\n576\n00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:48,800\nSo I will punch in my\npassword which is not that.\n\n577\n00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,500\nI have to remember my password.\n\n578\n00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:51,830\nThere we go.\n\n579\n00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:54,520\nAnd now I get to resize my disc.\n\n580\n00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:58,230\nNow notice it's allocating\nabout 20 gigs to Windows 8.\n\n581\n00:31:58,230 --> 00:32:00,320\nThat is the bare minimum.\n\n582\n00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,730\nI can't do any less the 20 gigs.\n\n583\n00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:08,340\nIf I just do 20 gigs, I probably wont\nhave any room for extra software.\n\n584\n00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:11,370\nSo we're normally gonna need\nto add a bit more to it.\n\n585\n00:32:11,370 --> 00:32:14,440\nI need to leave space for\nmy Mac partition, right?\n\n586\n00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:18,470\nI need OS X to work, but\nI also need Windows to work well too.\n\n587\n00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:22,700\nSo I can just move this little slider\nuntil I hit the number that I want.\n\n588\n00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:26,980\nAnd I said I wanted to do 64 gigs, which\nsometimes getting this little slider to\n\n589\n00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:29,940\nhit right on a number is\npretty challenging, so\n\n590\n00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:31,700\nI'll just get as close as I can here.\n\n591\n00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,190\n65, that sounds good.\n\n592\n00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:36,198\nAll right, so I'm gonna use 65 gigs for\nmy Windows install.\n\n593\n00:32:36,198 --> 00:32:39,540\nSo it's gonna take away that space\nfrom my Mac OS partition and\n\n594\n00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:43,200\nit's gonna create a new partition just for\nWindows.\n\n595\n00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,870\nSo I'll go ahead and hit Install.\n\n596\n00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:46,880\nAnd it's gonna do that right now, okay?\n\n597\n00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:49,130\nSo I can see it's partitioning the disk.\n\n598\n00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:50,820\nAnd this is that kind of high risk area.\n\n599\n00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:53,100\nAnytime you adjust partitions\nthere's always some risk.\n\n600\n00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:55,580\nNow, I've done this, I don't know,\n\n601\n00:32:55,580 --> 00:33:00,740\nprobably 20 times and never had an issue\nwith it, but it's always possible, right?\n\n602\n00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:03,450\nSo more than likely what's gonna happen\nis it's just gonna shrink here and\n\n603\n00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:06,730\ncreate the partition and we won't have\nany issues whatsoever, and we can\n\n604\n00:33:06,730 --> 00:33:10,200\ngo into our disk utility to verify that\nit's done, but it's gonna finish it here.\n\n605\n00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:13,370\nIt doesn't take long at all cuz most\nof the space at the end of your drive\n\n606\n00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:14,710\nis empty anyway.\n\n607\n00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:19,810\nNow, notice how it says I have\n226 Gigs of free space here.\n\n608\n00:33:19,810 --> 00:33:21,170\nYou do have to have free space.\n\n609\n00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:23,910\nYou can't shrink your drive if\nyou don't have any empty space.\n\n610\n00:33:23,910 --> 00:33:26,930\nSo make sure you kind of\nclean things up a bit.\n\n611\n00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:28,170\nThere, it's almost done.\n\n612\n00:33:28,170 --> 00:33:32,510\nAnd when it's done, not I've got a drive\nwhere I can install Windows without\n\n613\n00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:36,910\nmessing up my Mac system, and from there\n\n614\n00:33:36,910 --> 00:33:40,830\nit created that little boot camp partition\nand then it rebooted my computer.\n\n615\n00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:43,795\nSo now I need to switch\nover to using our skycam so\n\n616\n00:33:43,795 --> 00:33:47,073\nthat we'll be able to see\nthe actual desktop there.\n\n617\n00:33:47,073 --> 00:33:51,203\nSo, lets stop here and we'll switch that\ncamera around and then we'll get a chance\n\n618\n00:33:51,203 --> 00:33:54,463\nto see that, so give me just a moment\nwhile we flip around to that.\n\n619\n00:33:54,463 --> 00:33:59,493\n[SOUND] All right, so once that finished,\n\n620\n00:33:59,493 --> 00:34:04,962\nthe laptop automatically reboots, right?\n\n621\n00:34:04,962 --> 00:34:07,500\nSo let's cut over and\nsee what happens here.\n\n622\n00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:10,500\nSo it finished the partitioning and\nthen it rebooted, and\n\n623\n00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:12,250\nwhen it booted up what do I see?\n\n624\n00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:13,960\nI see my Windows 8 installer.\n\n625\n00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:17,070\nIt booted off of that USB hard\ndrive that we attached, and\n\n626\n00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:19,750\nit has all the installation files there.\n\n627\n00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:22,120\nNow, if you have a retina display,\n\n628\n00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:24,130\nlike I do,\nyou'll notice something right off the bat.\n\n629\n00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:28,350\nGosh, that is small text,\nit's microscopic, and\n\n630\n00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:32,040\nthe reason is,\nWindows based PCs don't normally\n\n631\n00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:35,570\nhave the high resolution screens\nthat we have with a retina display.\n\n632\n00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:39,550\nSo Microsoft hasn't really planned for\nthat font wise.\n\n633\n00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:42,100\nSo it is going to be\nmicroscopic on the screen.\n\n634\n00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:45,240\nIt is really hard,\nI know it's hard to see on the TV.\n\n635\n00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:48,806\nIn real life I can barely read what\nthat stuff says, it's so small.\n\n636\n00:34:48,806 --> 00:34:54,710\nOnce the install is done, though, we'll be\nable to install the support software and\n\n637\n00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:57,750\nApple takes care of correcting that for\nus.\n\n638\n00:34:57,750 --> 00:35:00,845\nSo once we install a support software,\nit'll make everything scale nice and\n\n639\n00:35:00,845 --> 00:35:01,615\nfit on the screen.\n\n640\n00:35:01,615 --> 00:35:05,126\nSo what I'm gonna do is,\nI'm just gonna squint my eyes here and\n\n641\n00:35:05,126 --> 00:35:07,660\nsee that I'm about to\ndo an English install.\n\n642\n00:35:08,970 --> 00:35:12,140\nAnother problem,\nI'm using my keyboard here,\n\n643\n00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:17,320\nI usually use my Magic Pad too but\nMicrosoft doesn't support the Magic Pad.\n\n644\n00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:20,940\nSo after we install our support software,\nwe'll have support for that too, so\n\n645\n00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:22,820\nI'll be able to use my Magic Pad again.\n\n646\n00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:26,886\nBut for right now, I'm just gonna\nworry about getting the install done.\n\n647\n00:35:26,886 --> 00:35:30,490\nSo I'm gonna advance here on\nthe install and we'll let that move.\n\n648\n00:35:30,490 --> 00:35:34,820\nA Windows 8 install usually happens pretty\nquickly, so this won't take too long.\n\n649\n00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:38,380\nThere's no difference here than\ninstalling on a normal PC.\n\n650\n00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:42,940\nWindows doesn't actually know that it's\nbeing installed inside of a partition\n\n651\n00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:43,800\non a Mac.\n\n652\n00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:46,367\nIt thinks it's just being\ninstalled on a regular old PC.\n\n653\n00:35:46,367 --> 00:35:48,851\nAnd what is it asking for here?\n\n654\n00:35:52,605 --> 00:35:55,849\nOh, it wants me to put in my\nproduct key but I am gonna, oops!\n\n655\n00:35:55,849 --> 00:35:59,536\nI'm going to just skip past that.\n\n656\n00:36:03,347 --> 00:36:07,301\nI'm going to try and skip past that,\nit's gonna make me punch in a product key,\n\n657\n00:36:07,301 --> 00:36:08,910\nsee this is good old Microsoft.\n\n658\n00:36:08,910 --> 00:36:12,600\nOne of the big advantages with Apple\nis when you buy an Apple device\n\n659\n00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:15,833\nyou're really buying the hardware,\nnot the software.\n\n660\n00:36:15,833 --> 00:36:18,980\nSo they don't do any crazy product keys or\nanything like that but\n\n661\n00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:22,084\non the Microsoft side,\nthey make their money on the software.\n\n662\n00:36:22,084 --> 00:36:25,310\nSo to do the install,\nI've gotta punch in a product key.\n\n663\n00:36:25,310 --> 00:36:27,890\nWell, the install itself\nisn't very exciting anyway.\n\n664\n00:36:27,890 --> 00:36:30,753\nI'm gonna punch in the product key and\nthen just press Next a bunch of times,\n\n665\n00:36:30,753 --> 00:36:31,977\nit is really what it amounts to.\n\n666\n00:36:31,977 --> 00:36:34,009\nSo, let me do that during the break.\n\n667\n00:36:34,009 --> 00:36:35,786\nI can't type a product key in on the air,\n\n668\n00:36:35,786 --> 00:36:37,996\nbecause then everybody\nwill have my product key.\n\n669\n00:36:37,996 --> 00:36:39,749\nSo, let me do that.\n\n670\n00:36:39,749 --> 00:36:41,589\nI'll punch it in and advance the install.\n\n671\n00:36:41,589 --> 00:36:45,627\nAnd, then, as soon as that's done, as\nsoon as it's advanced to a point enough,\n\n672\n00:36:45,627 --> 00:36:48,670\nI'll go ahead and bring it back on,\nand we'll continue on and\n\n673\n00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:51,207\nget that support software installed,\nall right?\n\n674\n00:36:51,207 --> 00:36:52,119\nSo, stay tuned.\n\n675\n00:36:52,119 --> 00:36:53,639\nWe'll be back after this.\n\n676\n00:36:53,639 --> 00:36:57,653\n[SOUND] All right, so\nI was gonna go ahead and\n\n677\n00:36:57,653 --> 00:37:02,001\njust breeze through the install for\nyou guys,\n\n678\n00:37:02,001 --> 00:37:06,480\nso that we didn't have to sit here and\nwatch it.\n\n679\n00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:09,633\nBut then I remembered there's something\nthat's not in the book that I definitely\n\n680\n00:37:09,633 --> 00:37:10,600\nwanted to show you guys.\n\n681\n00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:14,229\nWhen we reboot,\nit boots into the Windows 8 installer and\n\n682\n00:37:14,229 --> 00:37:19,110\nit asks me for a product key which I\npunched in while we were off camera.\n\n683\n00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:24,910\nBut now it's asking me whether I want\nto do a upgrade or a custom install,\n\n684\n00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:28,900\nand this is really weird terminology that\nwe might not be ready for, and I apologize\n\n685\n00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:32,160\nfor it being so small, but again,\nthe retina display makes it that way.\n\n686\n00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,700\nThere's not that much I can do here.\n\n687\n00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:35,690\nI've got it zoomed in as much as I can.\n\n688\n00:37:35,690 --> 00:37:38,500\nBut, what we wanna do here is,\nwe wanna actually go down and\n\n689\n00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:42,370\nchoose the custom install option,\nall right?\n\n690\n00:37:42,370 --> 00:37:46,050\nYou can't do an upgrade cuz there isn't\na version of Windows 8 already there, or\n\n691\n00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:47,270\nWindows 7, or whatever.\n\n692\n00:37:47,270 --> 00:37:48,540\nSo we gotta do a custom install.\n\n693\n00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:52,440\nAnd when you do a custom install,\nit asks what drive you want to install on.\n\n694\n00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:56,730\nNow you'll see a whole\nlist of drives here,\n\n695\n00:37:56,730 --> 00:38:00,920\nmost of which are either your boot\npartitions or your Mac hard drive.\n\n696\n00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,500\nAnd you don't wanna mess with those.\n\n697\n00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:06,290\nSo you can really cause some problems\nif you messed with one of those.\n\n698\n00:38:06,290 --> 00:38:10,360\nBut the thing I wanted to point out is\nno matter which one of these you pick,\n\n699\n00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:12,980\nthey all have this little warning on them,\n\n700\n00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:16,820\ndown her at the bottom that says Windows\ncannot be installed to that partition.\n\n701\n00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:19,570\nNone of them will let you install,\nall right.\n\n702\n00:38:19,570 --> 00:38:23,060\nAnd the reason is,\nnone of them are formatted properly.\n\n703\n00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:27,680\nSo what you have to do is you have to\npick the right drive and format it.\n\n704\n00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:32,220\nThe only way you can recognize which one\nis the right drive is based on the sizes.\n\n705\n00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:36,227\nSo I know I made a 65 gig drive,\nso I need to look for\n\n706\n00:38:36,227 --> 00:38:40,060\nthat partition that is\nroughly 65 gig in size.\n\n707\n00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:43,584\nNow, Apple and Microsoft measure\nthe sizes a little bit different and so\n\n708\n00:38:43,584 --> 00:38:44,756\nit may be slightly off.\n\n709\n00:38:44,756 --> 00:38:46,608\nIt probably won't be exactly 65.\n\n710\n00:38:46,608 --> 00:38:48,534\nSo I'm just gonna look down my list here,\nand\n\n711\n00:38:48,534 --> 00:38:50,770\nI've got 200 megs that\nwill be a boot partition.\n\n712\n00:38:50,770 --> 00:38:56,643\nI've got 400 gigs, that will be my\nMac hard drive, and then I've got 619\n\n713\n00:38:56,643 --> 00:39:01,654\nmegabytes, that's probably\na recovery partition or something.\n\n714\n00:39:01,654 --> 00:39:06,217\nAnd then I've got this one,\n60.9 gigabytes.\n\n715\n00:39:06,217 --> 00:39:09,096\nSo almost 61 gigabytes.\n\n716\n00:39:09,096 --> 00:39:12,079\nThat's really close to the 65\nI picked in the slider and\n\n717\n00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:14,430\nthis is likely gonna be the right one.\n\n718\n00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:17,150\nI can just double check the others to make\nsure there aren't any others that are in\n\n719\n00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:17,900\nthat range.\n\n720\n00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:20,742\nThere aren't and so I'll pick this one.\n\n721\n00:39:20,742 --> 00:39:22,700\nAll right, so\nthat's the one I'm gonna install to.\n\n722\n00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:25,530\nNow, it still says that\nit's not supported, and\n\n723\n00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:30,870\nwhat I need to do is I need to click\nthis format option, which is right here.\n\n724\n00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:34,840\nSo I'm just gonna hit format and\nthat's gonna format that drive and\n\n725\n00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,810\nget it ready for Windows.\n\n726\n00:39:36,810 --> 00:39:41,630\nRemember that Apple can read the Microsoft\nformat, but it can't write it.\n\n727\n00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:45,670\nSo Apple wasn't able to write\nthe format on that disk for me.\n\n728\n00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:49,420\nAnd now that it's done,\nnow that it's been formatted.\n\n729\n00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:52,680\nI can go back in here and\nI can pick the drive that I want, and\n\n730\n00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:54,210\nnow when I pick that drive,\n\n731\n00:39:54,210 --> 00:39:58,620\nthe warning is gone from the bottom saying\nthat we can't install on the drive.\n\n732\n00:39:58,620 --> 00:39:59,860\nSo there it is, so\n\n733\n00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:03,180\na little bit tricky and I wanted to make\nsure that I showed that to you guys,\n\n734\n00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:06,260\nbecause that's something you'll run into\nin real life, and it's not in the book.\n\n735\n00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:09,880\nIn the book it just says all right,\nnow install Windows, and, off you go.\n\n736\n00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:11,920\nIt doesn't really give you that hint.\n\n737\n00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:16,410\nAnd, if you make the wrong choice here,\nyou can damage your Apple install and\n\n738\n00:40:16,410 --> 00:40:17,600\nyou definitely don't want that.\n\n739\n00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:20,760\nYou still need Mac OS to work,\nafter this is all done.\n\n740\n00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:22,650\nThat's kind of the whole point.\n\n741\n00:40:22,650 --> 00:40:24,440\nSo, we definitely want that.\n\n742\n00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:25,970\nNow, the installer is going to kick in,\n\n743\n00:40:25,970 --> 00:40:28,690\nand it's still just going\nto be super microscopic.\n\n744\n00:40:28,690 --> 00:40:30,880\nThe install happens pretty quickly,\nthough.\n\n745\n00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:34,940\nSo it's going to perform its installation,\nand then it's going to reboot again and\n\n746\n00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:37,042\nit will boot into Windows.\n\n747\n00:40:37,042 --> 00:40:39,950\nAll right.\nAnd once it boots into Windows,\n\n748\n00:40:39,950 --> 00:40:43,460\nwe can install the support software and\nthen our font size will return to normal,\n\n749\n00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:46,130\nwe'll actually be able to\nread what's on the screen.\n\n750\n00:40:46,130 --> 00:40:50,190\nWe'll also have other things like\nthe ability to use our Magic Pad and\n\n751\n00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:53,605\nall that as soon as it's done.\n\n752\n00:40:53,605 --> 00:40:57,570\n[COUGH] It's churning along,\nit's already 12% of the way through, but\n\n753\n00:40:57,570 --> 00:41:01,080\nI'm going to get bored just standing here\ntwiddling my thumbs so maybe we'll let it\n\n754\n00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:05,050\nchurn through and we'll do another magic\nof TV moment and let it do its thing.\n\n755\n00:41:05,050 --> 00:41:06,860\nWhen it's done though, it will reboot.\n\n756\n00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:09,200\nIt will go back into\nthe Windows 8 operating system,\n\n757\n00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,778\nand then we'll be ready to get started.\n\n758\n00:41:10,778 --> 00:41:15,326\nAll right, so let's take another break and\nwe will be back after this.\n\n759\n00:41:15,326 --> 00:41:23,161\n[MUSIC]\n\n760\n00:41:23,161 --> 00:41:27,528\nAll right so the installer just finished\ncopying it's files and it rebooted and\n\n761\n00:41:27,528 --> 00:41:32,027\nit booted automatically back into Windows\n8 now that's kinda important thing,\n\n762\n00:41:32,027 --> 00:41:36,068\nit's gonna continue to boot right into\nWindows 8 until we tell it not to,\n\n763\n00:41:36,068 --> 00:41:38,050\nwhich we will do soon enough.\n\n764\n00:41:38,050 --> 00:41:40,830\nBut for right now we need it to boot\ninto Windows 8 cause we've gotta\n\n765\n00:41:40,830 --> 00:41:45,390\nreboot a few times, in a little\nbit we'll change that behavior.\n\n766\n00:41:45,390 --> 00:41:47,850\nBut now it's just asking for a PC name so\n\n767\n00:41:47,850 --> 00:41:52,300\nI'll call this maybe DP-Win8 or\nsomething like that.\n\n768\n00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:53,560\nSo I'll just punch in a name.\n\n769\n00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:56,230\nI'm going to go with the express\nsettings which you know,\n\n770\n00:41:56,230 --> 00:41:58,780\nprobably compromises my privacy somehow,\nbut\n\n771\n00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:04,700\nI'll just punch in some of this basic\ninformation to get the system set up.\n\n772\n00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,428\nAnd I have to type a password hint.\n\n773\n00:42:11,153 --> 00:42:12,402\nThere we go.\n\n774\n00:42:12,402 --> 00:42:15,120\nAll right, so that's just gonna\nfinish up creating my profile and\n\n775\n00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:16,750\nthen it's gonna boot into Windows 8.\n\n776\n00:42:16,750 --> 00:42:20,860\nNow, at that point we do have a fully\nusable Windows 8 machine, but\n\n777\n00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:22,850\nit's not quite right.\n\n778\n00:42:22,850 --> 00:42:26,610\nAnd that's gonna be evidenced by how\nsmall things are on the screen and\n\n779\n00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:28,050\nhow hard they are to read.\n\n780\n00:42:28,050 --> 00:42:32,152\nWe need to go an extra step to get it\nworking fully with our Apple hardware.\n\n781\n00:42:32,152 --> 00:42:33,210\nAll right.\n\n782\n00:42:33,210 --> 00:42:36,480\nSo that's where installing that support\nsoftware is gonna make a difference.\n\n783\n00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,235\nOh, hi laptop.\n\n784\n00:42:37,235 --> 00:42:41,220\n[LAUGH]\nWe're setting things up for you, so\n\n785\n00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:43,395\nnow there's more than one\nperson inside of my laptop.\n\n786\n00:42:43,395 --> 00:42:46,800\n[LAUGH] This is confidence inspiring.\n\n787\n00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:49,940\nAll right, so it's just kind of\nsquaring away the last things there.\n\n788\n00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:52,610\nIt's [LAUGH] getting\napps from the App Store,\n\n789\n00:42:52,610 --> 00:42:55,805\nwhich took just a second because there's\nno apps in the Microsoft App Store.\n\n790\n00:42:55,805 --> 00:42:58,492\n[LAUGH] Anyhow.\n\n791\n00:42:58,492 --> 00:43:03,250\nAll right, now I'm done,\nI'll stop making fun of Microsoft.\n\n792\n00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:08,160\nHere, I've got my modern UI screen for\nWindows 8, and I'm ready to go, right?\n\n793\n00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:10,310\nHey, this is my Windows\n8 operating system.\n\n794\n00:43:10,310 --> 00:43:10,890\nI'm ready to rock.\n\n795\n00:43:11,970 --> 00:43:13,730\nWell, I don't wanna stop, here.\n\n796\n00:43:13,730 --> 00:43:15,920\nI do need to install the support software.\n\n797\n00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:21,740\nThe support software was copied to the USB\ndrive, along side my install files.\n\n798\n00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:25,950\nSo in Windows 8, I just need to go\nahead and browse, and there's that\n\n799\n00:43:25,950 --> 00:43:30,960\nwind install drive, and I can browse\nthere, and I'll see a bunch of files.\n\n800\n00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,080\nAnd the one I'm looking for\n\n801\n00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:36,750\nis this set up file right here,\nwhich is gonna help me to install.\n\n802\n00:43:36,750 --> 00:43:39,270\nOr I'm sorry, shoot,\nthat's going install Windows.\n\n803\n00:43:39,270 --> 00:43:40,950\nI want to go into Boot Camp first.\n\n804\n00:43:40,950 --> 00:43:42,980\nSee the Boot Camp folder right there?\n\n805\n00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:46,552\nAnd inside of Boot Camp I want that setup,\nthat's the one that Apple put there.\n\n806\n00:43:46,552 --> 00:43:51,845\nAll right, so I'll go ahead and\nrun that I have to clear it for\n\n807\n00:43:51,845 --> 00:43:55,005\nadministrative access,\nand it's going to install.\n\n808\n00:43:55,005 --> 00:43:59,685\nSo, this is really just a collection of\ndrivers, and one small software program\n\n809\n00:43:59,685 --> 00:44:03,837\nthat's gonna help my windows install\nplay nice with my Apple hardware.\n\n810\n00:44:03,837 --> 00:44:04,915\nAll right.\n\n811\n00:44:04,915 --> 00:44:06,475\nSo we'll let that install,\n\n812\n00:44:06,475 --> 00:44:10,855\nit does take just a moment while it\ngets those drivers in place, and\n\n813\n00:44:10,855 --> 00:44:16,670\nwhen that's done, now I'll have a system\nthat's really truly ready to rock.\n\n814\n00:44:16,670 --> 00:44:21,630\nOkay, now if you're using somebody else's\ncomputer that has Boot Camp on it and\n\n815\n00:44:21,630 --> 00:44:23,750\nyou're not sure if they've\ncompleted this process or\n\n816\n00:44:23,750 --> 00:44:25,740\nnot there's a really easy way to tell.\n\n817\n00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:30,090\nDown here in the system tray, when you've\ngot the support software installed,\n\n818\n00:44:30,090 --> 00:44:31,900\nthere'll be a little icon down here.\n\n819\n00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:33,250\nIt will be a little Apple icon, so\n\n820\n00:44:33,250 --> 00:44:35,720\nthat you'll know that it's\ngot the software installed.\n\n821\n00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:37,150\nSo we'll see that when this is done.\n\n822\n00:44:37,150 --> 00:44:39,420\nIt'll have that little\ngray icon down there.\n\n823\n00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:42,090\nNow I've point that out,\nbecause we're gonna need to use it.\n\n824\n00:44:42,090 --> 00:44:44,700\nRight now,\nafter we've installed Boot Camp,\n\n825\n00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:48,140\nWindows is now the default\noperation system for our laptop.\n\n826\n00:44:48,140 --> 00:44:50,930\nSo every time I boot,\nit's gonna boot to Windows.\n\n827\n00:44:50,930 --> 00:44:53,390\nWhat if I want to boot to Mac OS?\n\n828\n00:44:53,390 --> 00:44:55,140\nWell I've got two choices.\n\n829\n00:44:55,140 --> 00:45:00,690\nOne, every time I boot I can hold\ndown the Alt key on my keyboard.\n\n830\n00:45:00,690 --> 00:45:06,575\nAnd as I hold it down, or the option key,\nit's alternate and option.\n\n831\n00:45:06,575 --> 00:45:09,725\nI'll hold that key down while I boot,\nand then it'll let me pick.\n\n832\n00:45:09,725 --> 00:45:11,825\nDo I want to boot off of my Windows disc,\nor\n\n833\n00:45:11,825 --> 00:45:15,885\ndo I wanna boot off of my Mac disc,\nright, and so I can choose that way.\n\n834\n00:45:15,885 --> 00:45:19,845\nOr I can change my default operating\nsystem, and I can set it so that\n\n835\n00:45:19,845 --> 00:45:23,990\nMac OS is my default OS, and it'll boot\nfrom that one, that's what I normally do.\n\n836\n00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:28,790\nSo when I run Windows, that's when I\nhold the option button down when I boot.\n\n837\n00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:32,790\nWhen I want Mac,\nit just boots right up into it.\n\n838\n00:45:32,790 --> 00:45:35,880\nSo we'll let it do its thing here,\nit's almost done.\n\n839\n00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:38,330\nAnd I see new things are starting\nto appear on my screen,\n\n840\n00:45:38,330 --> 00:45:41,710\nlike that little wireless icon wasn't\nthere a moment ago, and that was because\n\n841\n00:45:41,710 --> 00:45:46,430\nWindows didn't recognize the wireless\ndriver for this laptop, now it does.\n\n842\n00:45:46,430 --> 00:45:48,430\nRight, that's the type of stuff\nthat we're adding in here.\n\n843\n00:45:50,310 --> 00:45:51,170\nAll right.\n\n844\n00:45:51,170 --> 00:45:54,810\nWe've got a little white flag which\nI think means that it surrendered and\n\n845\n00:45:54,810 --> 00:45:57,340\nit's still just kind of doing it's thing.\n\n846\n00:45:57,340 --> 00:45:58,790\nWe'll give it just a moment there.\n\n847\n00:45:58,790 --> 00:46:02,810\nA lot of the hardware that's used in your\nMac is standard hardware from companies\n\n848\n00:46:02,810 --> 00:46:07,840\nlike Intel and AMD so\nnot anything too terribly special but\n\n849\n00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:10,980\nsome things like the bluetooth\ndriver those are special.\n\n850\n00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:14,140\nApple does some cool stuff with those\nto make it more compatible with\n\n851\n00:46:15,310 --> 00:46:17,980\nthe wireless keyboards and\nthe Magic Pads and all those devices.\n\n852\n00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:19,920\nSo, we're just getting\nall that squared away.\n\n853\n00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:21,190\nYour screen may flicker.\n\n854\n00:46:21,190 --> 00:46:22,130\nIt may resize.\n\n855\n00:46:22,130 --> 00:46:23,710\nIt may blank out.\n\n856\n00:46:23,710 --> 00:46:27,690\nYou might've noticed mine zoomed in super\nfar for a few moments there earlier.\n\n857\n00:46:27,690 --> 00:46:30,080\nThat's all stuff because it's\nloading video card drivers,\n\n858\n00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:32,860\nit's gotta get the video\ncard drivers put in place.\n\n859\n00:46:32,860 --> 00:46:37,840\nNow when I got this laptop, I didn't opt\nfor the 3D card option, this one just has\n\n860\n00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:43,310\nthe Intel Iris adapter in it, but if you\ndid the 3D one, if you got the Nvdia card,\n\n861\n00:46:43,310 --> 00:46:46,280\nyou're screen will do all sorts of\nweird stuff during this install.\n\n862\n00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:49,020\nJust let it finish It'll move through and\nget it in place.\n\n863\n00:46:50,852 --> 00:46:54,880\nAll right I can see it's installing\nthe SD card reader software now.\n\n864\n00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:57,100\nSo this laptop has an SD card slot on it.\n\n865\n00:46:57,100 --> 00:46:58,350\nYours may or may not.\n\n866\n00:46:58,350 --> 00:46:59,890\nAnd if it's a desktop you may or may not.\n\n867\n00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:01,670\nAnd then it's done.\n\n868\n00:47:03,952 --> 00:47:06,440\nAll right, now those were\ndrivers that were installed so\n\n869\n00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:08,400\nI'm going to have to\nreboot to let that finish.\n\n870\n00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:09,690\nSo I'll go ahead and let it reboot.\n\n871\n00:47:11,190 --> 00:47:14,970\nAnd then, we should be in Windows 8.\n\n872\n00:47:14,970 --> 00:47:17,950\nWe'll give it a moment while it restarts.\n\n873\n00:47:17,950 --> 00:47:20,330\nNow, I'm not holding any\nkeys on the keyboard.\n\n874\n00:47:20,330 --> 00:47:24,000\nSo my Mac is just booting up and\nit's booting right in to Windows.\n\n875\n00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,490\nSo that helps to remind me,\nWindows is my default OS.\n\n876\n00:47:27,490 --> 00:47:31,340\nAt this point, I basically have a Windows\nlaptop instead of a Mac laptop and\n\n877\n00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:34,130\nthat's It's probably not what\nwe want at the end of the day.\n\n878\n00:47:34,130 --> 00:47:35,549\nSo let me get logged in here.\n\n879\n00:47:40,756 --> 00:47:42,130\nAll right.\n\n880\n00:47:42,130 --> 00:47:46,906\nAnd once we're logged in, what I\nshould see is my nice normal desktop,\n\n881\n00:47:46,906 --> 00:47:52,179\nwhich might be microscopic again, and\nit's just depends on where it left me.\n\n882\n00:47:52,179 --> 00:47:56,760\nAnd I should see in my system tray\na little Apple utility running down there,\n\n883\n00:47:56,760 --> 00:48:02,130\nand that's what I can use to change back\nto having Mac OS, as my startup disk.\n\n884\n00:48:02,130 --> 00:48:04,220\nSo I'm gonna give it a moment\nwhile it finishes booting.\n\n885\n00:48:04,220 --> 00:48:05,780\nAnd that'll be one of\nthe first things that I check.\n\n886\n00:48:07,340 --> 00:48:09,310\nSo, I'll just drop to my desktop.\n\n887\n00:48:09,310 --> 00:48:10,886\nAnd now, the screen is not too bad.\n\n888\n00:48:12,886 --> 00:48:15,553\nSo here I am, I'm on my Mac.\n\n889\n00:48:15,553 --> 00:48:17,210\nIt's now got all the drivers ready.\n\n890\n00:48:17,210 --> 00:48:18,220\nI'm running Windows.\n\n891\n00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:22,020\nAnd now, any of those propriety\napplications that I had, line-of-business\n\n892\n00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:25,720\napplications of whatever that required\nWindows, I can run them right here.\n\n893\n00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:31,120\nAnd they'll run at the performance level\nbeing run, right on the real hardware.\n\n894\n00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:33,530\nI don't have a virtualization\nlayer slowing me down.\n\n895\n00:48:33,530 --> 00:48:37,740\nSo, VMware Fusion,\nParallels the really good software, but\n\n896\n00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:39,960\nthey do hurt performance a bit.\n\n897\n00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:41,730\nHere, I'm running on native hardware.\n\n898\n00:48:42,830 --> 00:48:46,310\nThe biggest negative being though that\nI'm in Windows, I'm not in Mac OS.\n\n899\n00:48:46,310 --> 00:48:50,000\nSo, that's not really the ideal solution,\nbut it does work and it is very effective.\n\n900\n00:48:51,020 --> 00:48:56,470\nSo, the last step for me is going to\nbe making sure that I put Mac OS,\n\n901\n00:48:56,470 --> 00:48:58,390\nback to being my default OS.\n\n902\n00:48:58,390 --> 00:49:00,410\nSo, down here in my system tray,\n\n903\n00:49:01,630 --> 00:49:05,890\nI can see that little Apple\nlogo right there for Boot Camp.\n\n904\n00:49:05,890 --> 00:49:11,862\nAnd if I right-click on it you'll\nsee About Boot Camp, Boot Camp Help.\n\n905\n00:49:11,862 --> 00:49:15,260\nAnd then I want this\nBoot Camp Control Panel.\n\n906\n00:49:15,260 --> 00:49:16,940\nThat's what I want.\n\n907\n00:49:16,940 --> 00:49:20,650\nAnd the Boot Camp Control Panel\ndoesn't have a ton of options in it.\n\n908\n00:49:20,650 --> 00:49:24,440\nWhen you look at it,\nit really just has whether we want to boot\n\n909\n00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:29,310\ninto Mac OSX as our default,\nor Windows as our default.\n\n910\n00:49:29,310 --> 00:49:31,522\nAnd so, I can choose which one I want.\n\n911\n00:49:31,522 --> 00:49:34,480\nI'm gonna go ahead, and\nchoose the Macintosh HD.\n\n912\n00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:37,678\nI want that to be my default,\nand then I'll just hit Restart.\n\n913\n00:49:39,886 --> 00:49:41,570\nSo, we'll go ahead, and say OK to that.\n\n914\n00:49:41,570 --> 00:49:44,095\nAnd it's gonna restart.\n\n915\n00:49:44,095 --> 00:49:50,880\nFrom now on, whenever I reboot,\nit's gonna go to Mac OS by default.\n\n916\n00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:53,960\nAnd so, I see my Apple logo there,\nand then it should kick over,\n\n917\n00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:57,530\nI should get my little spinning wheel,\nand then it'll jump into Mac OS.\n\n918\n00:49:57,530 --> 00:49:58,990\nSo, we'll give it a moment\nwhile it does that.\n\n919\n00:50:00,630 --> 00:50:04,020\nAfter it boots up, I'm gonna go ahead,\nand do another restart.\n\n920\n00:50:04,020 --> 00:50:08,190\nAnd I'll hold down the Option\nslash Alt key while we boot,\n\n921\n00:50:08,190 --> 00:50:10,480\nand we'll get a chance to see it there.\n\n922\n00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:14,512\nSo, I'm gonna go ahead, and log in cuz\nthat always makes it a little bit faster.\n\n923\n00:50:19,511 --> 00:50:22,550\nSo there we go, I'm back into my Mac.\n\n924\n00:50:22,550 --> 00:50:24,920\nNow, notice my hard drives here.\n\n925\n00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:27,680\nI can see that WinINSTALL\nthat was created earlier.\n\n926\n00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:29,340\nThat's the USB drive.\n\n927\n00:50:29,340 --> 00:50:31,020\nI'm done with the USB drive now, so\n\n928\n00:50:31,020 --> 00:50:33,120\nI don't really need to\nkeep that hanging around.\n\n929\n00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:36,940\nAnd I can go ahead, and\neject that, and disconnect it.\n\n930\n00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:40,330\nSo, I'm done with it,\nlet me just get off of the laptop here.\n\n931\n00:50:41,980 --> 00:50:44,570\nBut I still have this\npartition called Boot Camp.\n\n932\n00:50:44,570 --> 00:50:46,670\nThat is my Windows drive.\n\n933\n00:50:46,670 --> 00:50:49,010\nThat's where we just installed Windows to.\n\n934\n00:50:49,010 --> 00:50:52,970\nMac OS can read that drive,\nbut it can't write to it.\n\n935\n00:50:52,970 --> 00:50:54,810\nSo, I browse into it.\n\n936\n00:50:54,810 --> 00:50:57,540\nAnd if I had some Windows files there,\nI could browse right in here, and\n\n937\n00:50:57,540 --> 00:50:59,419\nfind them, and get out.\n\n938\n00:51:00,540 --> 00:51:03,100\nBut what I can't do,\nis I can't write to it.\n\n939\n00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:05,740\nSo I can't go, and start creating folders,\nand putting files in there.\n\n940\n00:51:05,740 --> 00:51:06,410\nThat's not gonna work.\n\n941\n00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:12,136\nAnd then if I restart, so\nI'm gonna just go ahead, and hit Restart.\n\n942\n00:51:14,636 --> 00:51:19,291\nWhen we reboot, I'm gonna hold down\nthe Alt, and Option button here,\n\n943\n00:51:19,291 --> 00:51:21,630\nthis Option button on my keyboard.\n\n944\n00:51:21,630 --> 00:51:23,820\nI guess,\nI couldn't wait till it actually reboots.\n\n945\n00:51:23,820 --> 00:51:28,300\nAnd when it boots, I'll get that choice to\npick which hard drive I'm gonna boot from,\n\n946\n00:51:28,300 --> 00:51:30,430\nand I'll just tell it, hey,\nboot from the Windows one.\n\n947\n00:51:30,430 --> 00:51:33,100\nSo, that should come up here any time now.\n\n948\n00:51:34,510 --> 00:51:36,875\nThis is where my patience\nstarts to get tested.\n\n949\n00:51:36,875 --> 00:51:42,345\n[LAUGH] It doesn't matter how fast\ncomputers are, they're never fast enough.\n\n950\n00:51:46,310 --> 00:51:47,261\nWell, this is exciting.\n\n951\n00:51:47,261 --> 00:51:49,678\nSo anyhow, when it reboots\nbasically we have the choice.\n\n952\n00:51:49,678 --> 00:51:51,846\nNow, we can switch between Mac OS, and\n\n953\n00:51:51,846 --> 00:51:54,490\nWindows just by holding\ndown on our option key.\n\n954\n00:51:54,490 --> 00:51:58,020\nSo, I'm holding down option right now,\nwhile it reboots, and there we go.\n\n955\n00:51:58,020 --> 00:52:01,810\nSo, I can pick, if I wanna boot from\nmy Macintosh hard drive, I can.\n\n956\n00:52:01,810 --> 00:52:04,420\nIf I wanna boot from my\nWindows hard drive, I can.\n\n957\n00:52:04,420 --> 00:52:07,140\nAnd if I wanna boot from Recovery, I can.\n\n958\n00:52:07,140 --> 00:52:08,890\nThere's my choice, right there.\n\n959\n00:52:09,950 --> 00:52:13,090\nSo, I can pick Windows, and\nit'll take me right back into Windows 8.\n\n960\n00:52:13,090 --> 00:52:16,060\nSo now,\nI've got a dual boot configuration.\n\n961\n00:52:16,060 --> 00:52:19,360\nI can move back, and\nforth between the two, as I choose.\n\n962\n00:52:21,370 --> 00:52:26,020\nNow, if I decide that I don't really\ncare for Windows, I'm done with it,\n\n963\n00:52:26,020 --> 00:52:27,040\nI don't need it anymore.\n\n964\n00:52:28,420 --> 00:52:31,380\nGetting rid of it is actually pretty easy.\n\n965\n00:52:31,380 --> 00:52:35,060\nTo get rid of it,\nwe just boot back into Mac OS, and\n\n966\n00:52:35,060 --> 00:52:39,260\nwe can use our Disk Utility\nto remove that partition.\n\n967\n00:52:39,260 --> 00:52:43,170\nBut the better thing to do, is to actually\nrun the Boot Camp Assistant again.\n\n968\n00:52:43,170 --> 00:52:46,220\nAnd the Boot Camp Assistant\ncan take care of it for us.\n\n969\n00:52:46,220 --> 00:52:48,310\nIf we use the Boot Camp Wizard to do it,\n\n970\n00:52:48,310 --> 00:52:51,180\nthe Boot Camp Assistant,\nthen it will also take care of\n\n971\n00:52:51,180 --> 00:52:55,790\nstretching our partition back to fill up\nthe space that we made for Boot Camp.\n\n972\n00:52:55,790 --> 00:53:00,160\nSo, when it's time to get rid of it,\nwe can just fire that back up.\n\n973\n00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:02,180\nAnd it'll have the Option in their,\nto knock that out.\n\n974\n00:53:02,180 --> 00:53:04,011\nSo, let me get logged back in.\n\n975\n00:53:06,011 --> 00:53:08,450\nAnd we'll take care of that here.\n\n976\n00:53:08,450 --> 00:53:09,820\nSo actually, let me do this.\n\n977\n00:53:09,820 --> 00:53:14,210\nI'm gonna switch back to my digital\ndisplay because that's a little bit\n\n978\n00:53:14,210 --> 00:53:14,770\nfaster.\n\n979\n00:53:14,770 --> 00:53:18,690\nLet me, Not that faster, but it's clearer.\n\n980\n00:53:18,690 --> 00:53:22,980\nSo, Jason,\ncan we flip back to the digital display?\n\n981\n00:53:22,980 --> 00:53:26,557\nThis where my director starts\nto get really angry at me,\n\n982\n00:53:26,557 --> 00:53:30,861\nwhen I start coming up with crazy\ncamera change in this mid-show.\n\n983\n00:53:30,861 --> 00:53:34,850\n[LAUGH] So,\nwe're gonna switch over to that, so\n\n984\n00:53:34,850 --> 00:53:36,410\nit's a little easier for you guys to see.\n\n985\n00:53:36,410 --> 00:53:37,020\nThere!\nThere we go.\n\n986\n00:53:37,020 --> 00:53:38,620\nSee?\nIt looks so much better.\n\n987\n00:53:38,620 --> 00:53:43,010\nSo, what I'm gonna do is go\nback to my Boot Camp Assistant.\n\n988\n00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:46,428\nOr my notifications one, or the other.\n\n989\n00:53:49,970 --> 00:53:52,160\nAnd so,\nI'm gonna launch my Boot Camp Assistant.\n\n990\n00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:55,347\nNow, we use Boot Camp Assistant,\nto install Boot Camp, and\n\n991\n00:53:55,347 --> 00:53:57,470\ninstall Windows 8 a minute ago.\n\n992\n00:53:57,470 --> 00:54:03,086\nBut when you re-run it, you'll see here\nwhere it's offering to remove Windows 7,\n\n993\n00:54:03,086 --> 00:54:06,670\nor a later version,\nwhich includes Windows 8.\n\n994\n00:54:06,670 --> 00:54:08,220\nSo, I wanna remove it.\n\n995\n00:54:08,220 --> 00:54:12,470\nI'll just hit Continue, and it's gonna\nshow me what my drive will look like,\n\n996\n00:54:12,470 --> 00:54:13,380\nwhen it's done.\n\n997\n00:54:13,380 --> 00:54:15,380\nSo, it's gonna get Windows 8 out of there,\nand\n\n998\n00:54:15,380 --> 00:54:19,940\nit's gonna stretch my Mac OS partition\nback, to fill the whole drive.\n\n999\n00:54:19,940 --> 00:54:21,560\nSo, I'll go ahead and hit Restore.\n\n1000\n00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:24,710\nNow, I hate that it says the word restore.\n\n1001\n00:54:24,710 --> 00:54:29,090\nIt's not restoring your data, so if you\nhad data that was lost, or whatever,\n\n1002\n00:54:29,090 --> 00:54:31,960\nit's not like it's restoring from backup,\nor anything.\n\n1003\n00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:36,450\nIt's just putting your partition\nlayout back, to the way that it was.\n\n1004\n00:54:36,450 --> 00:54:40,750\nI can see my WinINSTALL disc\ndisappeared from my desktop, and\n\n1005\n00:54:40,750 --> 00:54:44,030\nnow I just have my\nMacintosh HD on the desktop.\n\n1006\n00:54:44,030 --> 00:54:45,353\nAnd now, it's sorting it back out again.\n\n1007\n00:54:45,353 --> 00:54:49,880\nSo, getting the Boot Camp setup,\nnot very hard.\n\n1008\n00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:52,310\nUndoing it, not very hard either.\n\n1009\n00:54:52,310 --> 00:54:55,960\nNow, regardless of whether you're\ngonna use this in real life,\n\n1010\n00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:58,640\nyou need to be familiar with it for\nthe exam.\n\n1011\n00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:03,070\nAnd the exam is gonna expect you to know\nthings like the steps that I just went\n\n1012\n00:55:03,070 --> 00:55:05,690\nthrough, and\nthe order that they happen in.\n\n1013\n00:55:05,690 --> 00:55:06,890\nThe most important thing for\n\n1014\n00:55:06,890 --> 00:55:11,740\nyou to remember is step one,\ndo your software updates.\n\n1015\n00:55:11,740 --> 00:55:14,780\nYou've gotta have the latest\nsoftware updates for this to work.\n\n1016\n00:55:14,780 --> 00:55:16,490\nOtherwise, it can cause problems.\n\n1017\n00:55:16,490 --> 00:55:21,260\nAnd then step two, make sure you\nhave your install images, and\n\n1018\n00:55:21,260 --> 00:55:25,500\na USB disk, or CD,\nDVD to be able to use to do the install.\n\n1019\n00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:28,960\nYou gotta kinda have those pieces together\nto before you even fire up the boot\n\n1020\n00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:29,810\ncamp assistant.\n\n1021\n00:55:32,140 --> 00:55:35,980\nSo, when it comes to\ncross-platform compatibility,\n\n1022\n00:55:35,980 --> 00:55:38,450\nBoot Camp is definitely a solution.\n\n1023\n00:55:38,450 --> 00:55:40,590\nI don't think of it as\ncompatibility though,\n\n1024\n00:55:40,590 --> 00:55:42,910\nbecause we're really just skipping,\nMac OS at that point.\n\n1025\n00:55:42,910 --> 00:55:45,119\nSo, we're really just getting\ncompatibility with our hardware, but\n\n1026\n00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:45,990\nnot software.\n\n1027\n00:55:45,990 --> 00:55:50,620\nSolutions like VMware Fusion, and\nParallels, that's a little closer because\n\n1028\n00:55:50,620 --> 00:55:56,640\nwe can run Mac OS as our main OS, and\nthen run our Windows apps on top of it.\n\n1029\n00:55:56,640 --> 00:56:00,760\nEven better is finding native\napplications, that perform our needs so\n\n1030\n00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:04,260\nthat we can run just Mac OS, and not have\nto worry about the Windows platform.\n\n1031\n00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:05,130\nThat's the best solution.\n\n1032\n00:56:07,550 --> 00:56:11,220\nWell, that pretty much wraps up Boot Camp,\nand how it works.\n\n1033\n00:56:11,220 --> 00:56:15,330\nAnd it wraps up the Apple certified\nassociate the exam objective for\n\n1034\n00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:18,040\nMac Integration Basics.\n\n1035\n00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:20,832\nLet me just remind you guys if you\nhave
