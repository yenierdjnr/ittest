          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:03.912\n[SOUND] In this series,\n\n2\n00:00:03.912 --> 00:00:08.432\nwe're gonna be looking at\n\n3\n00:00:08.432 --> 00:00:12.753\nMac Management Basics.\n\n4\n00:00:12.753 --> 00:00:15.212\nDon, can you tell us a little\nbit about this certification?\n\n5\n00:00:15.212 --> 00:00:20.084\n>> Sure, the Mac Management Basics exam,\nit's designed to introduce\n\n6\n00:00:20.084 --> 00:00:24.410\npeople to the world of, well,\nmanaging Macs, basically.\n\n7\n00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.060\n[LAUGH] And so, it's kind of a neat one.\n\n8\n00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.670\nIt's part of Apple's training and\ncertification path.\n\n9\n00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.060\nAnd they've got several certifications.\n\n10\n00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:32.963\nLet me just bring it up\nhere on their webpage.\n\n11\n00:00:32.963 --> 00:00:36.040\nThe OS10 Training and\nCertification Roadmap.\n\n12\n00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.910\nThey've got several, and it's gotten\na little confusing cuz some have been\n\n13\n00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.290\nupgraded to El Capitan and some haven't.\n\n14\n00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:43.840\nBut basically you have these\ntwo certifications that\n\n15\n00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.420\nare Mac Integration Basics and\nMac Management Basics.\n\n16\n00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.588\nThere are two exams you can take.\n\n17\n00:00:49.588 --> 00:00:51.966\nAnd when you pass either one of them,\n\n18\n00:00:51.966 --> 00:00:56.129\nyou get the Apple Certified\nAssociate Cerification, the ACA.\n\n19\n00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.079\nAnd an Apple certified associate is\nsupposed to be some who's out there in\n\n20\n00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:04.490\nthe field, who's supporting Macs in\na business or education type environment.\n\n21\n00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:06.710\nSo the ACA certification\nis that entry step,\n\n22\n00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.250\nthat first step on your journey to\ngetting certified in the Mac world.\n\n23\n00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.540\n>> Now when it comes to\ndemographics on all exams,\n\n24\n00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.810\nwe have a certain body of\npeople that this is for,\n\n25\n00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.670\nwhether it be introductory,\nwhether it be advanced or intermediate.\n\n26\n00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.200\nDon, what can we expect?\n\n27\n00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.340\n>> This one is definitely beginner.\n\n28\n00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.620\nSo you don't have to know a whole heck\nof a lot to be able to jump in and\n\n29\n00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:29.690\ntackle this one.\n\n30\n00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:33.090\nIt's actually, I say it's one of\nthe easier certifications to get.\n\n31\n00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.550\nIt's not that it's super easy.\n\n32\n00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:37.754\nIt's just that it It's really\nstuff you use everyday.\n\n33\n00:01:37.754 --> 00:01:42.290\nSome certifications cover topics that\nare such fringe knowledge that you're not\n\n34\n00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:43.580\ngonna need.\n\n35\n00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.310\nBut this one, it's all practical stuff\nthat you are gonna use in the real world.\n\n36\n00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.560\nI know I really enjoy this one,\n\n37\n00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.130\nit's one you can find an easy tangible\nway to apply in your workplace.\n\n38\n00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:53.730\nSo, you don't need\na tome of experience but\n\n39\n00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:55.490\nyou do need to be familiar with Mac OS.\n\n40\n00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.490\nYou do need to already know how\nto get the system preferences and\n\n41\n00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.720\nhow to change basic operations,\nthings like that.\n\n42\n00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.180\nJust really simple stuff.\n\n43\n00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.049\nAnd then what we do is we basically\ntake those skills and we say,\n\n44\n00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:08.105\nall right you know how\nto do it on 1 computer,\n\n45\n00:02:08.105 --> 00:02:11.921\nlet's show you how to do it on 1,000\ncomputers, and do it all at once, right?\n\n46\n00:02:11.921 --> 00:02:15.690\nHow to really manage these larger\nenvironments that go beyond what a home\n\n47\n00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.010\nuser would make use of.\n\n48\n00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.990\nSo, if you've got a little bit of\nexposure to the operating system,\n\n49\n00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:21.830\nyou'll do fine with the rest of it.\n\n50\n00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:24.910\n>> As with any certification,\nthere are gonna be a series of topics and\n\n51\n00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.250\ncontent that you're gonna have to be\naware of to be able to pass the exam.\n\n52\n00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.210\nDon, what kinda topics can we expect\nto see inside of Mac Management Basics?\n\n53\n00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:34.260\n>> All right, well I've got a little\noutline kinda fired up here.\n\n54\n00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.047\nThis is what we're gonna\nbuild the show of.\n\n55\n00:02:36.047 --> 00:02:40.087\nAnd basically it gets broken down into\nsix or seven different topics areas.\n\n56\n00:02:40.087 --> 00:02:42.380\nWe're gonna start with\ncreating system images.\n\n57\n00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.421\nMost of us never have to install Mac OS\ncuz it comes on our Macs when we buy them.\n\n58\n00:02:46.421 --> 00:02:50.399\nBut if you wanna have a standard image\non all of your machines in your entire\n\n59\n00:02:50.399 --> 00:02:53.110\ncompany, you'll need to\ncreate a system image.\n\n60\n00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:54.671\nSo we take a look at how to do that.\n\n61\n00:02:54.671 --> 00:02:58.767\nAnd then we take a look at how to deploy\nthose images, so roll it out on hundreds,\n\n62\n00:02:58.767 --> 00:03:03.110\nthousands, tens of thousands of computers\nso you have a consistent environment for\n\n63\n00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:04.130\nall of your users.\n\n64\n00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:06.550\nThen we take a look at\nmanaging those next.\n\n65\n00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:07.475\nOnce you've deployed them,\n\n66\n00:03:07.475 --> 00:03:09.590\nhow do you keep them nice and clean and\nrunning the way that you want?\n\n67\n00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.997\nHow do you lock them down for\nsecurity purposes and\n\n68\n00:03:11.997 --> 00:03:14.680\njust keep them configured\nthe way you want?\n\n69\n00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.140\nWe take a look at how to do\nthat with Apple Remote Desktop,\n\n70\n00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.370\nwhich is really cool utility from Apple.\n\n71\n00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.940\nAnd we also use the Profile Manager\nwhich is another one.\n\n72\n00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:23.870\nTwo different tools.\n\n73\n00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.480\nThey perform a similar action but\n\n74\n00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.460\nyou'll see in the show there's\nactually a difference between the two.\n\n75\n00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:31.327\nTowards the end of the show we jump into\nsoftware updates cuz you've gotta keep\n\n76\n00:03:31.327 --> 00:03:32.421\nyour Macs up to date, right?\n\n77\n00:03:32.421 --> 00:03:35.925\nGotta keep them with the latest security\npatches and application updates so\n\n78\n00:03:35.925 --> 00:03:36.754\nthey run smooth.\n\n79\n00:03:36.754 --> 00:03:38.815\nAnd then we jump into the caching service,\n\n80\n00:03:38.815 --> 00:03:41.171\nwhich helps us to save\nbandwidth on the network.\n\n81\n00:03:41.171 --> 00:03:44.555\nAnd we wrap up just talking a little bit\nabout the differences between those cuz\n\n82\n00:03:44.555 --> 00:03:46.000\nyou have to pick one or the other.\n\n83\n00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.797\nYou can't deploy both.\n\n84\n00:03:46.797 --> 00:03:49.726\nSo, those are some of the topics that\nwe're gonna be hitting throughout\n\n85\n00:03:49.726 --> 00:03:50.310\nthis series.\n\n86\n00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.110\nAnd like I said,\nevery one of these are real world,\n\n87\n00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:56.780\npractical skills that you will use in a\ncorporate environment where you use Macs.\n\n88\n00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:59.740\n>> Now, you've done your studying,\nyou've watched the videos,\n\n89\n00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:01.330\nyou've gone out there and\nyou've researched.\n\n90\n00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:02.740\nNow it's time to sit the seat.\n\n91\n00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:04.421\nDon, how do I take this exam?\n\n92\n00:04:04.421 --> 00:04:05.023\n>> All right, well,\n\n93\n00:04:05.023 --> 00:04:07.660\nthis exam's a little different than a lot\nof the others that we do on ITProTV.\n\n94\n00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:12.110\nMost of the time you've gotta go over\nPearson VUE's website or somewhere to take\n\n95\n00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:16.730\nthe exam, but for this one you can\ntake it online right from Apple.\n\n96\n00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:19.800\nThat's another reason that this one\nis great to start out with because\n\n97\n00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:21.630\nthe content is good content.\n\n98\n00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.070\nAnd it's real world stuff.\n\n99\n00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:24.610\nIt's not a ton of content.\n\n100\n00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:27.020\nYou can actually get used\nto it pretty quick, and\n\n101\n00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:28.920\nthen the exam is inexpensive and\navailable online.\n\n102\n00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.310\nSo it's like a perfect storm of great\nthings to make this a wonderful\n\n103\n00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:32.340\ncert to get.\n\n104\n00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:37.380\nNow, as of the filming of this episode,\nthe 10.11 exam is not officially out.\n\n105\n00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:38.820\nIt's due out any day now.\n\n106\n00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:42.631\nSo for right now if you wanna take it,\nyou'll have to take the 10.10 exam, but\n\n107\n00:04:42.631 --> 00:04:45.420\nthe 10.10 and\n10.11 exams are almost identical.\n\n108\n00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:49.962\nThere's very little difference\nbetween Yosemite and El Capitan.\n\n109\n00:04:49.962 --> 00:04:52.540\nIn fact, the only real difference\nis in the disk utility.\n\n110\n00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:54.260\nThe disk utility changed in El Capitan.\n\n111\n00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.650\nOtherwise it's really about the same.\n\n112\n00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:01.512\nSo, if you go to Apple's website though,\nyou can browse to\n\n113\n00:05:01.512 --> 00:05:07.172\ntraining.apple.com/itpro/macmanagement101-\n0/exam.\n\n114\n00:05:07.172 --> 00:05:09.932\nAnd be sure to check if the 1011/exam is\n\n115\n00:05:09.932 --> 00:05:14.600\navailable because by the time you\nwatch this it may very well be.\n\n116\n00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:17.850\nOnce you go to that site, here's where\nit tells you all about the exam and\n\n117\n00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:19.320\nhow you can register for it.\n\n118\n00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:21.680\nIt is a two hour exam.\n\n119\n00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:22.800\nIt's taken online.\n\n120\n00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.440\nYou can take it from\nthe comfort of your own home.\n\n121\n00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:26.540\nYou don't have to go to an Apple center or\nanything like that,\n\n122\n00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:28.220\nyou can just do it right\nfrom your own computer.\n\n123\n00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:32.570\nIt costs $65.00, and you can take\nthe exam, and you'll get a pass or\n\n124\n00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:33.520\nfail score right then.\n\n125\n00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.090\nYou'll know if you're certified.\n\n126\n00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:37.300\nAnd now you're a Apple\ncertified associate.\n\n127\n00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:41.296\nTo take it you go to\ntraining.apple.com/acrs.\n\n128\n00:05:41.296 --> 00:05:44.560\nAnd on that website,\nthey'll have where you can register for\n\n129\n00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:47.087\nthe exam, take it,\npass it and get certified.\n\n130\n00:05:47.087 --> 00:05:50.587\nSo, like I said it's a great\nplace to get started.\n\n131\n00:05:50.587 --> 00:05:52.755\nI shouldn't say it's an easy exam,\nbut I feel like saying that.\n\n132\n00:05:52.755 --> 00:05:55.195\nYou'll find that it's just\nnot a huge volume of content.\n\n133\n00:05:55.195 --> 00:05:56.905\nSo it's easier to grasp the material and\n\n134\n00:05:56.905 --> 00:05:58.485\nit' something that you'll\nmake use of in real life.\n\n135\n00:05:58.485 --> 00:06:00.285\nSo, definitely one that I recommend.\n\n136\n00:06:00.285 --> 00:06:02.145\nAnd one that I think really works out for\n\n137\n00:06:02.145 --> 00:06:05.635\nthe people that are wanting to get\nstarted in the world of Mac management.\n\n138\n00:06:05.635 --> 00:06:08.235\nSo, if that sounds exciting to you\nthen you are in the right place.\n\n139\n00:06:08.235 --> 00:06:10.575\nStay tuned cuz we've got\nMac Management Basics for\n\n140\n00:06:10.575 --> 00:06:15.760\nEl Capitan OSX 10.11 coming up next.\n\n141\n00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:18.010\nIf that doesn't sound like\nyour cup of tea, don't worry.\n\n142\n00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:18.972\nYou're not hurting my feelings.\n\n143\n00:06:18.972 --> 00:06:21.290\nYou've got plenty of Linux and\nWindows training available on the site.\n\n144\n00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:23.410\nBe sure to check out our course library.\n\n145\n00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:26.000\nBut otherwise, enough of me rattling on.\n\n146\n00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.421\nLet's get started with some\nMac Management Basics.\n\n147\n00:06:28.421 --> 00:06:35.089\n[SOUND]\n\n",
