          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:03.912\n[SOUND] In this series,\n\n2\n00:00:03.912 --> 00:00:08.432\nwe're gonna be looking at\n\n3\n00:00:08.432 --> 00:00:12.753\nMac Management Basics.\n\n4\n00:00:12.753 --> 00:00:15.212\nDon, can you tell us a little\nbit about this certification?\n\n5\n00:00:15.212 --> 00:00:20.084\n>> Sure, the Mac Management Basics exam,\nit's designed to introduce\n\n6\n00:00:20.084 --> 00:00:24.410\npeople to the world of, well,\nmanaging Macs, basically.\n\n7\n00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.060\n[LAUGH] And so, it's kind of a neat one.\n\n8\n00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.670\nIt's part of Apple's training and\ncertification path.\n\n9\n00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.060\nAnd they've got several certifications.\n\n10\n00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:32.963\nLet me just bring it up\nhere on their webpage.\n\n11\n00:00:32.963 --> 00:00:36.040\nThe OS10 Training and\nCertification Roadmap.\n\n12\n00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.910\nThey've got several, and it's gotten\na little confusing cuz some have been\n\n13\n00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.290\nupgraded to El Capitan and some haven't.\n\n14\n00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:43.840\nBut basically you have these\ntwo certifications that\n\n15\n00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.420\nare Mac Integration Basics and\nMac Management Basics.\n\n16\n00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.588\nThere are two exams you can take.\n\n17\n00:00:49.588 --> 00:00:51.966\nAnd when you pass either one of them,\n\n18\n00:00:51.966 --> 00:00:56.129\nyou get the Apple Certified\nAssociate Cerification, the ACA.\n\n19\n00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.079\nAnd an Apple certified associate is\nsupposed to be some who's out there in\n\n20\n00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:04.490\nthe field, who's supporting Macs in\na business or education type environment.\n\n21\n00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:06.710\nSo the ACA certification\nis that entry step,\n\n22\n00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.250\nthat first step on your journey to\ngetting certified in the Mac world.\n\n23\n00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.540\n>> Now when it comes to\ndemographics on all exams,\n\n24\n00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.810\nwe have a certain body of\npeople that this is for,\n\n25\n00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.670\nwhether it be introductory,\nwhether it be advanced or intermediate.\n\n26\n00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.200\nDon, what can we expect?\n\n27\n00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.340\n>> This one is definitely beginner.\n\n28\n00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.620\nSo you don't have to know a whole heck\nof a lot to be able to jump in and\n\n29\n00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:29.690\ntackle this one.\n\n30\n00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:33.090\nIt's actually, I say it's one of\nthe easier certifications to get.\n\n31\n00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.550\nIt's not that it's super easy.\n\n32\n00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:37.754\nIt's just that it It's really\nstuff you use everyday.\n\n33\n00:01:37.754 --> 00:01:42.290\nSome certifications cover topics that\nare such fringe knowledge that you're not\n\n34\n00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:43.580\ngonna need.\n\n35\n00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.310\nBut this one, it's all practical stuff\nthat you are gonna use in the real world.\n\n36\n00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.560\nI know I really enjoy this one,\n\n37\n00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.130\nit's one you can find an easy tangible\nway to apply in your workplace.\n\n38\n00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:53.730\nSo, you don't need\na tome of experience but\n\n39\n00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:55.490\nyou do need to be familiar with Mac OS.\n\n40\n00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.490\nYou do need to already know how\nto get the system preferences and\n\n41\n00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.720\nhow to change basic operations,\nthings like that.\n\n42\n00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.180\nJust really simple stuff.\n\n43\n00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.049\nAnd then what we do is we basically\ntake those skills and we say,\n\n44\n00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:08.105\nall right you know how\nto do it on 1 computer,\n\n45\n00:02:08.105 --> 00:02:11.921\nlet's show you how to do it on 1,000\ncomputers, and do it all at once, right?\n\n46\n00:02:11.921 --> 00:02:15.690\nHow to really manage these larger\nenvironments that go beyond what a home\n\n47\n00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.010\nuser would make use of.\n\n48\n00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.990\nSo, if you've got a little bit of\nexposure to the operating system,\n\n49\n00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:21.830\nyou'll do fine with the rest of it.\n\n50\n00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:24.910\n>> As with any certification,\nthere are gonna be a series of topics and\n\n51\n00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.250\ncontent that you're gonna have to be\naware of to be able to pass the exam.\n\n52\n00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.210\nDon, what kinda topics can we expect\nto see inside of Mac Management Basics?\n\n53\n00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:34.260\n>> All right, well I've got a little\noutline kinda fired up here.\n\n54\n00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.047\nThis is what we're gonna\nbuild the show of.\n\n55\n00:02:36.047 --> 00:02:40.087\nAnd basically it gets broken down into\nsix or seven different topics areas.\n\n56\n00:02:40.087 --> 00:02:42.380\nWe're gonna start with\ncreating system images.\n\n57\n00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.421\nMost of us never have to install Mac OS\ncuz it comes on our Macs when we buy them.\n\n58\n00:02:46.421 --> 00:02:50.399\nBut if you wanna have a standard image\non all of your machines in your entire\n\n59\n00:02:50.399 --> 00:02:53.110\ncompany, you'll need to\ncreate a system image.\n\n60\n00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:54.671\nSo we take a look at how to do that.\n\n61\n00:02:54.671 --> 00:02:58.767\nAnd then we take a look at how to deploy\nthose images, so roll it out on hundreds,\n\n62\n00:02:58.767 --> 00:03:03.110\nthousands, tens of thousands of computers\nso you have a consistent environment for\n\n63\n00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:04.130\nall of your users.\n\n64\n00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:06.550\nThen we take a look at\nmanaging those next.\n\n65\n00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:07.475\nOnce you've deployed them,\n\n66\n00:03:07.475 --> 00:03:09.590\nhow do you keep them nice and clean and\nrunning the way that you want?\n\n67\n00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.997\nHow do you lock them down for\nsecurity purposes and\n\n68\n00:03:11.997 --> 00:03:14.680\njust keep them configured\nthe way you want?\n\n69\n00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.140\nWe take a look at how to do\nthat with Apple Remote Desktop,\n\n70\n00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.370\nwhich is really cool utility from Apple.\n\n71\n00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.940\nAnd we also use the Profile Manager\nwhich is another one.\n\n72\n00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:23.870\nTwo different tools.\n\n73\n00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.480\nThey perform a similar action but\n\n74\n00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.460\nyou'll see in the show there's\nactually a difference between the two.\n\n75\n00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:31.327\nTowards the end of the show we jump into\nsoftware updates cuz you've gotta keep\n\n76\n00:03:31.327 --> 00:03:32.421\nyour Macs up to date, right?\n\n77\n00:03:32.421 --> 00:03:35.925\nGotta keep them with the latest security\npatches and application updates so\n\n78\n00:03:35.925 --> 00:03:36.754\nthey run smooth.\n\n79\n00:03:36.754 --> 00:03:38.815\nAnd then we jump into the caching service,\n\n80\n00:03:38.815 --> 00:03:41.171\nwhich helps us to save\nbandwidth on the network.\n\n81\n00:03:41.171 --> 00:03:44.555\nAnd we wrap up just talking a little bit\nabout the differences between those cuz\n\n82\n00:03:44.555 --> 00:03:46.000\nyou have to pick one or the other.\n\n83\n00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.797\nYou can't deploy both.\n\n84\n00:03:46.797 --> 00:03:49.726\nSo, those are some of the topics that\nwe're gonna be hitting throughout\n\n85\n00:03:49.726 --> 00:03:50.310\nthis series.\n\n86\n00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.110\nAnd like I said,\nevery one of these are real world,\n\n87\n00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:56.780\npractical skills that you will use in a\ncorporate environment where you use Macs.\n\n88\n00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:59.740\n>> Now, you've done your studying,\nyou've watched the videos,\n\n89\n00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:01.330\nyou've gone out there and\nyou've researched.\n\n90\n00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:02.740\nNow it's time to sit the seat.\n\n91\n00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:04.421\nDon, how do I take this exam?\n\n92\n00:04:04.421 --> 00:04:05.023\n>> All right, well,\n\n93\n00:04:05.023 --> 00:04:07.660\nthis exam's a little different than a lot\nof the others that we do on ITProTV.\n\n94\n00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:12.110\nMost of the time you've gotta go over\nPearson VUE's website or somewhere to take\n\n95\n00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:16.730\nthe exam, but for this one you can\ntake it online right from Apple.\n\n96\n00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:19.800\nThat's another reason that this one\nis great to start out with because\n\n97\n00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:21.630\nthe content is good content.\n\n98\n00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.070\nAnd it's real world stuff.\n\n99\n00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:24.610\nIt's not a ton of content.\n\n100\n00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:27.020\nYou can actually get used\nto it pretty quick, and\n\n101\n00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:28.920\nthen the exam is inexpensive and\navailable online.\n\n102\n00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.310\nSo it's like a perfect storm of great\nthings to make this a wonderful\n\n103\n00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:32.340\ncert to get.\n\n104\n00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:37.380\nNow, as of the filming of this episode,\nthe 10.11 exam is not officially out.\n\n105\n00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:38.820\nIt's due out any day now.\n\n106\n00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:42.631\nSo for right now if you wanna take it,\nyou'll have to take the 10.10 exam, but\n\n107\n00:04:42.631 --> 00:04:45.420\nthe 10.10 and\n10.11 exams are almost identical.\n\n108\n00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:49.962\nThere's very little difference\nbetween Yosemite and El Capitan.\n\n109\n00:04:49.962 --> 00:04:52.540\nIn fact, the only real difference\nis in the disk utility.\n\n110\n00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:54.260\nThe disk utility changed in El Capitan.\n\n111\n00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.650\nOtherwise it's really about the same.\n\n112\n00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:01.512\nSo, if you go to Apple's website though,\nyou can browse to\n\n113\n00:05:01.512 --> 00:05:07.172\ntraining.apple.com/itpro/macmanagement101-\n0/exam.\n\n114\n00:05:07.172 --> 00:05:09.932\nAnd be sure to check if the 1011/exam is\n\n115\n00:05:09.932 --> 00:05:14.600\navailable because by the time you\nwatch this it may very well be.\n\n116\n00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:17.850\nOnce you go to that site, here's where\nit tells you all about the exam and\n\n117\n00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:19.320\nhow you can register for it.\n\n118\n00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:21.680\nIt is a two hour exam.\n\n119\n00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:22.800\nIt's taken online.\n\n120\n00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.440\nYou can take it from\nthe comfort of your own home.\n\n121\n00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:26.540\nYou don't have to go to an Apple center or\nanything like that,\n\n122\n00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:28.220\nyou can just do it right\nfrom your own computer.\n\n123\n00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:32.570\nIt costs $65.00, and you can take\nthe exam, and you'll get a pass or\n\n124\n00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:33.520\nfail score right then.\n\n125\n00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.090\nYou'll know if you're certified.\n\n126\n00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:37.300\nAnd now you're a Apple\ncertified associate.\n\n127\n00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:41.296\nTo take it you go to\ntraining.apple.com/acrs.\n\n128\n00:05:41.296 --> 00:05:44.560\nAnd on that website,\nthey'll have where you can register for\n\n129\n00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:47.087\nthe exam, take it,\npass it and get certified.\n\n130\n00:05:47.087 --> 00:05:50.587\nSo, like I said it's a great\nplace to get started.\n\n131\n00:05:50.587 --> 00:05:52.755\nI shouldn't say it's an easy exam,\nbut I feel like saying that.\n\n132\n00:05:52.755 --> 00:05:55.195\nYou'll find that it's just\nnot a huge volume of content.\n\n133\n00:05:55.195 --> 00:05:56.905\nSo it's easier to grasp the material and\n\n134\n00:05:56.905 --> 00:05:58.485\nit' something that you'll\nmake use of in real life.\n\n135\n00:05:58.485 --> 00:06:00.285\nSo, definitely one that I recommend.\n\n136\n00:06:00.285 --> 00:06:02.145\nAnd one that I think really works out for\n\n137\n00:06:02.145 --> 00:06:05.635\nthe people that are wanting to get\nstarted in the world of Mac management.\n\n138\n00:06:05.635 --> 00:06:08.235\nSo, if that sounds exciting to you\nthen you are in the right place.\n\n139\n00:06:08.235 --> 00:06:10.575\nStay tuned cuz we've got\nMac Management Basics for\n\n140\n00:06:10.575 --> 00:06:15.760\nEl Capitan OSX 10.11 coming up next.\n\n141\n00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:18.010\nIf that doesn't sound like\nyour cup of tea, don't worry.\n\n142\n00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:18.972\nYou're not hurting my feelings.\n\n143\n00:06:18.972 --> 00:06:21.290\nYou've got plenty of Linux and\nWindows training available on the site.\n\n144\n00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:23.410\nBe sure to check out our course library.\n\n145\n00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:26.000\nBut otherwise, enough of me rattling on.\n\n146\n00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.421\nLet's get started with some\nMac Management Basics.\n\n147\n00:06:28.421 --> 00:06:35.089\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:20.350\nAnd we've got a great show for you today,\nas we dive in to Mac management basics.\n\n4\n00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:24.080\nAnd we've got none other than\nMister Don Pezet here to help us out.\n\n5\n00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:25.400\nDon, how are you doing sir?\n\n6\n00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.670\n>> I am doing great Wes,\nready to kick this turkey off and\n\n7\n00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:30.260\njump in to the exciting world\nof installation images.\n\n8\n00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.420\nInside of our Mac\nmanagement basics training.\n\n9\n00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:36.410\nAnd this is kind of an important\ntechnology to understand.\n\n10\n00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.390\nIt's obviously the first thing that\nwe're covering for Mac managment basic.\n\n11\n00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.610\nSo, let's just start off with a little\nbit of, what is an installation image and\n\n12\n00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:45.000\nwhy we care about it?\n\n13\n00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.950\nNow the short answer is,\nthat most people don't care about it.\n\n14\n00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:50.920\nIt's really not something most\npeople have to deal with.\n\n15\n00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.680\nIf you think about it,\nyou go and you buy a Macbook or\n\n16\n00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.070\nan iMac or a Mac Mini or MacPro.\n\n17\n00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.650\nWhatever it is, you buy a Mac and\nit's already got OS10 loaded on it,\n\n18\n00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:01.790\nit's already installed.\n\n19\n00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:04.780\nYou push that power button,\nit asked you what your name is and\n\n20\n00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:05.780\nwhat password you want to use.\n\n21\n00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.760\nOr, you can sign in with your\niCloud account and off you go.\n\n22\n00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.640\nSo very, very simple process.\n\n23\n00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:17.190\nMost Mac users never have to install OS10,\nbut if you do have to install OS10.\n\n24\n00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.310\nThen you're going to need to know\nabout installation images and\n\n25\n00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.990\nthe different types that are available.\n\n26\n00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.710\nAnd from an enterprise or\nfrom a business environment.\n\n27\n00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.680\nYou might need to do this not just once or\ntwice, but hundreds or\n\n28\n00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.660\neven thousands of times, right.\n\n29\n00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:31.410\nLet me give you a scenario here.\n\n30\n00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:32.880\nLet's say that you work for\n\n31\n00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.100\na school and your school has certain\neducational software you use.\n\n32\n00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.970\nAnd you've decided, hey,\nwe've finally got some budget money in and\n\n33\n00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.330\nwe are going to refresh all\nthe computers in the school.\n\n34\n00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.810\nSo, we're going to buy 1,000 computers and\nwe need to get them deployed.\n\n35\n00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.460\nThey needed to be running\nthe latest version of OSX, so\n\n36\n00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.200\nwe need to be running El Capitan, right.\n\n37\n00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.490\nAnd, we need to have our educational\nsoftware loaded on them.\n\n38\n00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:55.780\nWell, I got a choice.\n\n39\n00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.930\nI could, one by one,\nfire up all 1,000 of those computers.\n\n40\n00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.400\nI could run through that little startup\nwizard and give it a name and a password.\n\n41\n00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.510\nI could then install the school\nsoftware on those machines one by one.\n\n42\n00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:10.970\nAnd I could do it 1000 times,\nand it would take forever.\n\n43\n00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.460\nNow, if you're an hourly\nemployee that's cool, right.\n\n44\n00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:15.560\nHey, it's job security.\n\n45\n00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.570\nYou are going to be working hours and\nhours for months on end.\n\n46\n00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.250\nBut if your goal is to have it\ndone by the end of the week, and\n\n47\n00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.510\nyou've got a very small IT department.\n\n48\n00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.030\nWhich most companies do,\nyou need a way to get it done faster.\n\n49\n00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.720\nAnd so, what we can do is,\nwe can build installation images.\n\n50\n00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.040\nThat have OSX setup,\nexactly the way that we wanted.\n\n51\n00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.120\nThat has the user accounts that we need,\nthat has the software that we want in\n\n52\n00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.862\nthere, that has everything\nalready baked in.\n\n53\n00:02:41.862 --> 00:02:44.060\nSo that,\nwhen I get those thousand machines,\n\n54\n00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.620\nall I have to do is power them on and\nstart the installation process.\n\n55\n00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.310\nIt'll install OS10 and have it completely\nset up the way that we wanted.\n\n56\n00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:54.312\nAnd now, you can rapidly provision\nlarge quantities of machines.\n\n57\n00:02:54.312 --> 00:02:56.910\nNow, you see why I say most\npeople don't care about this.\n\n58\n00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.690\nIs your home user gonna do this?\n\n59\n00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:00.350\nNo.\n\n60\n00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:03.890\nIf you have five computers to set up or\neven ten computers to set up.\n\n61\n00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:06.600\nIt's typically faster just\ndoing them by hand, right.\n\n62\n00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.290\nApple calls that a hands-off deployment.\n\n63\n00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.520\nAnd I think it's funny,\nbecause it's not hands-off.\n\n64\n00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.720\nYou actually have to do a lot\nof work to get them done.\n\n65\n00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.721\nBut it's technically your hands off,\nright.\n\n66\n00:03:16.721 --> 00:03:19.996\n[LAUGH] You could give them, I could\ngive Wes here a new laptop and say,\n\n67\n00:03:19.996 --> 00:03:21.334\nhere you go Wes, set it up.\n\n68\n00:03:21.334 --> 00:03:26.040\n[LAUGH] And he can run through that\nwizard and create his account.\n\n69\n00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.420\nAnd start installing his software and\ndo it all himself, my hands are off.\n\n70\n00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:36.490\nBut if I want a true hands off, they call\nit a ZTI, a Zero Touch Installation.\n\n71\n00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:39.920\nWhere you bring up the Mac and\nit just gets installed,\n\n72\n00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:41.620\nhas everything set up the way you want it.\n\n73\n00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.310\nWell for that,\nyou're going to need installation images.\n\n74\n00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:46.000\nAnd so, in this episode and\nin the next couple of episodes,\n\n75\n00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.920\nwe're going to see those.\n\n76\n00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.120\nAnd in this episode,\n\n77\n00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.390\nI want to start off with just what\nthe different image types are.\n\n78\n00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:54.570\nAnd give us an introduction to\nthe most common type of images.\n\n79\n00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:56.310\nAnd then, we'll work through some\nof the more advanced ones in\n\n80\n00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:57.270\nthe next few episodes.\n\n81\n00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:01.600\n>> Now Don, I've worked with some imaging\nsystems before, where you do create files.\n\n82\n00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:04.820\nThat you can push out to these machines\nand you can have that operating system.\n\n83\n00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:06.490\nAnd one of the things that\nI've always noticed is,\n\n84\n00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:09.300\nthat you got to pay attention to\nwhat kind of image file you have.\n\n85\n00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:10.810\nAnd what certain scenario,\n\n86\n00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.130\nbecause it's not necessarily a one\nsize fits all, when we do this.\n\n87\n00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:16.880\nSo, we do have multiple things we\nhave to take into consideration here.\n\n88\n00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.810\n>> Absolutely, and\nif you're a network administrator and\n\n89\n00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:22.760\nyou do this type of thing for\nMicrosoft Windows.\n\n90\n00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:23.867\nIt's actually kind of a nightmare,\n\n91\n00:04:23.867 --> 00:04:25.446\nit's really difficult\nthrough the Windows world.\n\n92\n00:04:25.446 --> 00:04:27.910\nBecause you have the licensing and\nthe other things to deal with.\n\n93\n00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:30.117\nIn the Mac world,\nit's really not that hard,\n\n94\n00:04:30.117 --> 00:04:32.505\nbecause we don't have to\nworry about licensing.\n\n95\n00:04:32.505 --> 00:04:36.174\nAnd the hardware drivers are all already\nbaked into the operating system, so\n\n96\n00:04:36.174 --> 00:04:37.680\nit actually is easy.\n\n97\n00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.451\nBut one of the things we have\nto understand very early on,\n\n98\n00:04:40.451 --> 00:04:43.239\nis that there's four different\ntypes of system images.\n\n99\n00:04:43.239 --> 00:04:46.880\nThat we can make and we need to know\nwhich is the right one for our needs.\n\n100\n00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:48.440\nNow, we're going to see all\nfour of them here in this show,\n\n101\n00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:49.180\nbut let's just start off.\n\n102\n00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:53.105\nI've got just a list of them right here,\nthe four different types.\n\n103\n00:04:53.105 --> 00:04:55.435\nSo, the first is just\nstraight up disk image and\n\n104\n00:04:55.435 --> 00:04:56.995\nwe're going to see that\none in this episode.\n\n105\n00:04:56.995 --> 00:05:01.315\nThese are the little dmg files, that you\ndownload from the web all over the place.\n\n106\n00:05:01.315 --> 00:05:05.755\nIf you want to install software on your\nmachine, people can take that software and\n\n107\n00:05:05.755 --> 00:05:07.155\nwrap it up in a dmg file.\n\n108\n00:05:07.155 --> 00:05:11.030\nAnd that just stands for disk image and\nyou can quickly deploy that out.\n\n109\n00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:13.470\nNow, DMG files are great for\ndistributing software.\n\n110\n00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:15.270\nThey're not great for\n\n111\n00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:18.500\ndistributing operating systems,\nbecause they're not bootable.\n\n112\n00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:21.590\nThe images that are inside\nof a DMG are not bootable.\n\n113\n00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:24.030\nAnd, if you install using one of them,\n\n114\n00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:26.810\nthey can't carry things like\na recovery partition in them.\n\n115\n00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:30.600\nSo, there's a few things that\nare not present in a DMG file.\n\n116\n00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.560\nSo, great for distributing software,\nnot great for\n\n117\n00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:35.210\nsetting up a new Mac from scratch.\n\n118\n00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:38.400\nLike formatting the hard drive and\nbringing it up from nothing.\n\n119\n00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.940\nThe other three though,\n\n120\n00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:45.410\ngive us full bootable operating\nsystems that are installable.\n\n121\n00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:48.380\nThere's NetBoot,\nNetInstall, and NetRestore.\n\n122\n00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:50.600\nAnd all three of them,\nthey have names that are very similar.\n\n123\n00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:53.030\nSo, they're super easy\nto mix up on the exam.\n\n124\n00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:56.020\nYou need to make sure you know\nthe difference between each.\n\n125\n00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:59.540\nNow the first one is NetBoot,\nI mean they all start with Net, right.\n\n126\n00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:02.140\nWhich means that these images\nare going to be coming from a server.\n\n127\n00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:04.500\nAnd we're going to install and\ndeploy those out to our machines.\n\n128\n00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:06.030\nWhich, If you've got 1000 computers,\n\n129\n00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:08.950\nyou don't want to have to go around with\na USB key to every single one of them.\n\n130\n00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:10.950\nSo, you're just going to pull\nthem right off the network,\n\n131\n00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:12.870\nget thrown in and off we go.\n\n132\n00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:15.590\nSo after that, we have to figure out\nwhat it is we're trying to do and\n\n133\n00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:16.960\nthe name gives us that hint.\n\n134\n00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:18.500\nRight, boot, install and restore.\n\n135\n00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:21.710\nNow, NetBoot, the first one,\n\n136\n00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:26.800\nthis is where I need to boot a computer\nup, directly off of the network.\n\n137\n00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:29.570\nNow, most of us aren't really\ngoing to have to do this.\n\n138\n00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:33.480\nBut let's say for example, you have\na Mac and the hard drive has failed.\n\n139\n00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:35.570\nIf the hard drive has\nfailed can you boot it up?\n\n140\n00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:37.190\nNo, it's dead in the water, right.\n\n141\n00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:40.800\nSo, if I want to boot it up and\ngo what they call disk-less.\n\n142\n00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.230\nRight?\nYou boot the system up with no\n\n143\n00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:43.290\nhard drive in it.\n\n144\n00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:44.660\nWell we can use NetBoot.\n\n145\n00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:49.360\nNetBoot can reach across the network,\nfind a bootable image, and\n\n146\n00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:50.830\nboot your Mac up using it.\n\n147\n00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:52.660\nNow, I know I said diskless,\n\n148\n00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:54.740\nNetBoot actually does expect\nyou to have a hard drive.\n\n149\n00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:57.880\nBecause it's caching the operating\nsystem files that it loads.\n\n150\n00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:01.150\nUnless you make an operating system\nimage that's so small it can fit in RAM.\n\n151\n00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:02.780\nIf you do that,\nit can actually run without a disk, but\n\n152\n00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:04.940\nit does expect to have a hard drive.\n\n153\n00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:08.370\nSo, If you've got a system where you\nhave the hard drive that's suspect.\n\n154\n00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:09.620\nMaybe you think it's failing.\n\n155\n00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:13.390\nMaybe the hard drive just has a bunch of\njunk on it and you want to format the Mac.\n\n156\n00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:15.790\nWell, you can do that by using NetBook.\n\n157\n00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:17.770\nAn internet recovery is\na great example of that.\n\n158\n00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:20.570\nWhen you boot your Mac up and\nit connects to Apple's servers and\n\n159\n00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:22.400\nwe'll see that in another episode.\n\n160\n00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:23.560\nBut when you do internet recovery,\n\n161\n00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:25.740\nyou're technically using\nNetBoot across the Internet.\n\n162\n00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:29.820\nNow the key thing about NetBoot,\nis it doesn't install an operating system.\n\n163\n00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:32.930\nYou turn the computer on,\nit loads the OS from the network.\n\n164\n00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:35.890\nAnd you're now running from that\nnetwork image and when you turn it off,\n\n165\n00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:37.000\nit throws it all away.\n\n166\n00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.590\nRight, so it's a temporary operating\nsystem that's just run from the network.\n\n167\n00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:43.990\nAnd that's cool if you've got something\nlike, let's say, you have a lab set up for\n\n168\n00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:44.520\nstudents.\n\n169\n00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:46.960\nI'll go back and\nuse that school environment again, right.\n\n170\n00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:49.270\nYou get a group of high\nschool kids on a computer and\n\n171\n00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:51.650\nyou'd be shocked at what you end\nup with at the end of the day.\n\n172\n00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:52.880\nWallpapers are changed.\n\n173\n00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:55.225\nAnd software's installed and\nwho knows what.\n\n174\n00:07:55.225 --> 00:07:58.626\nSo if you're using netboot images,\nyou just turn that computer off and\n\n175\n00:07:58.626 --> 00:07:59.711\nturn it back on again.\n\n176\n00:07:59.711 --> 00:08:02.189\nAnd when it boots back up,\nit reloads that boot image and\n\n177\n00:08:02.189 --> 00:08:03.736\nit's It's back fresh and clean.\n\n178\n00:08:03.736 --> 00:08:07.143\nSo if you want a fresh and clean computer\nevery day, NetBoot works great, but\n\n179\n00:08:07.143 --> 00:08:08.410\nit doesn't install the OS.\n\n180\n00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:09.510\nIt's not permanent.\n\n181\n00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:12.030\nAnd that's when the next one comes in,\nwhich is NetInstall.\n\n182\n00:08:12.030 --> 00:08:17.830\nNetInstall, we can actually\ninstall OS X over the network.\n\n183\n00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:21.490\nSo you can fire up that Mac,\nit can reach out and grab a copy of OS X,\n\n184\n00:08:21.490 --> 00:08:23.250\nand install it.\n\n185\n00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:24.690\nAnd that's a great way.\n\n186\n00:08:24.690 --> 00:08:27.330\nIf you've got a whole building full of,\n\n187\n00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:31.860\nlet's say you've got a bunch of Macs all\nrunning Yosemite or Mavericks, and you\n\n188\n00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:36.560\nwant to upgrade to El Capitan you could\nbuild a NetInstall image of El Capitan and\n\n189\n00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:39.190\nthen you could go to all of those\nmachines and install it over the network.\n\n190\n00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:42.330\nNow, I know what you're saying, hey I\ncould just log into the app store and\n\n191\n00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:43.550\ndo it that way too, right?\n\n192\n00:08:43.550 --> 00:08:45.910\nWell you certainly could, but\n\n193\n00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:48.200\nyou'd have to log into\nthe App Store on all those Macs.\n\n194\n00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:51.500\nWhat if you don't want to log into\nthe App Store on a thousand Macs to be\n\n195\n00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:53.190\nable to go and download and install it?\n\n196\n00:08:53.190 --> 00:08:55.030\nThis way we can do it without\neven configuring the App Store.\n\n197\n00:08:55.030 --> 00:08:56.040\nWe don't even have to use it, right?\n\n198\n00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:57.670\nIt's just on via the network.\n\n199\n00:08:57.670 --> 00:09:01.670\nYou can also use things like the automator\nutility to customize that image.\n\n200\n00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:05.060\nSo that it can do things like creating\nuser accounts inside of it or\n\n201\n00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:08.090\npartitioning the hard drive a certain way,\nsetting permissions,\n\n202\n00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:09.800\nyou can do all sorts\nof really cool things.\n\n203\n00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:13.500\nAnything you can do in the automator,\nyou can do on that NetInstall image.\n\n204\n00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:15.190\nAnd then the last one is NetRestore.\n\n205\n00:09:15.190 --> 00:09:19.470\nNetRestore is probably the coolest one,\nbecause with NetRestore what we do, is you\n\n206\n00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:24.450\ntake one Mac, and you build it up and you\nget it set up the exact way you want it.\n\n207\n00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:27.610\nYou install all the software you want,\nit can be third-party software.\n\n208\n00:09:27.610 --> 00:09:29.330\nYou can install Microsoft Office for\n\n209\n00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:34.600\nMac, you can install Firefox or\nGoogle Chrome, whatever browsers you want.\n\n210\n00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:37.790\nYou can set up bookmarks, get everything\nset up exactly the way you want it.\n\n211\n00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:40.710\nAnd then you take an image\nof that machine, and\n\n212\n00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:42.600\nyou build a NetRestore image out of it.\n\n213\n00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:45.980\nAnd then you can go to those thousand\nMacs in your school, or business, or\n\n214\n00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:48.970\nwherever, and\ndeploy that Net Restore image.\n\n215\n00:09:48.970 --> 00:09:51.490\nAnd when you do it,\nall that third party software,\n\n216\n00:09:51.490 --> 00:09:53.940\nall that configuration\ncomes right along with it.\n\n217\n00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:59.100\nAnd now, you have a brand new Mac that\nyou just took out of the box an hour ago\n\n218\n00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:01.160\nthat's now completely set up and\nready to run.\n\n219\n00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:03.980\nThat is the fastest form\nof provisioning Macs\n\n220\n00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:05.530\nto get them out in your business network.\n\n221\n00:10:05.530 --> 00:10:08.610\nThen again, home users don't care about\nanything that I just said, right?\n\n222\n00:10:08.610 --> 00:10:10.140\nThey just go through and do it.\n\n223\n00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:13.750\nBut in a business environment where\nyou've got a large quantity of machines,\n\n224\n00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:16.420\nthis saves you a ton of time.\n\n225\n00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:18.980\n>> Don, so let's go back real\nquick to your hour-by-hour.\n\n226\n00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:22.400\nI'm the hourly employee and\nI've got 1000 computers to provision.\n\n227\n00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:23.905\nI'm happy right?\n\n228\n00:10:23.905 --> 00:10:24.808\nCuz I've got job security.\n\n229\n00:10:24.808 --> 00:10:29.115\nSo in some of the install types that\nyou've shown us, would you say that this\n\n230\n00:10:29.115 --> 00:10:32.953\ngives you also that centralized\nadministration over them, versus\n\n231\n00:10:32.953 --> 00:10:38.070\na decentralized approach of, or are we not\nquite into the decentralized approach yet?\n\n232\n00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:41.250\n>> So, it sets us up, for\ncentralized management.\n\n233\n00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:41.970\n>> Gotcha, gotcha.\n>> Because,\n\n234\n00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:44.320\nwhat's gonna happen is I get\nthose thousand Macs, right?\n\n235\n00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:45.340\nAnd I deploy this image.\n\n236\n00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:48.569\nAnd so, at that very moment,\nall 1,000 of those Macs are identical.\n\n237\n00:10:49.630 --> 00:10:52.790\nBut then I turn them over to my users,\nand the users start messing with them.\n\n238\n00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:53.770\nThey start changing them,\n\n239\n00:10:53.770 --> 00:10:56.540\nthey start modifying them,\nnow they're not the same anymore.\n\n240\n00:10:56.540 --> 00:10:57.500\n>> Those darn users.\n\n241\n00:10:57.500 --> 00:11:00.360\n>> But I've already rolled the image out,\nI'm not gonna roll it out again.\n\n242\n00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:03.560\nIf I roll out NetRestore again,\nit's gonna format their hard drive.\n\n243\n00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:05.790\nWe'll see later, you can actually\nmake it where it doesn't do that,\n\n244\n00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:06.820\nwhere you don't format their hard drive.\n\n245\n00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:08.110\nYou normally want that, right?\n\n246\n00:11:08.110 --> 00:11:10.260\nSo you format the hard drive,\nthey lose their data.\n\n247\n00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:12.900\nSo this gives us consistency\nin centralized management,\n\n248\n00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:14.440\nas far as the deployment goes.\n\n249\n00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:18.430\nBut when it comes to managing them after\nthe fact, that's where we're gonna need\n\n250\n00:11:18.430 --> 00:11:21.280\nthings like Profile Manager,\nthat we're gonna see later in the series.\n\n251\n00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:25.240\nWhere we can create policies, where we\ncan force people, and I can say hey,\n\n252\n00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:28.760\nI want every Mac in this building\nto have an ITPro.tv wallpaper, and\n\n253\n00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:29.490\nI can deploy it out.\n\n254\n00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:32.660\nAnd if somebody changes it, the policy\nwill change it right back again.\n\n255\n00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:34.850\nOr it'll just stop them from\nchanging it in the first place.\n\n256\n00:11:34.850 --> 00:11:36.640\nYou can do that with different settings.\n\n257\n00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:39.720\nI can enforce password policies,\nand screen saver settings, and\n\n258\n00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:42.700\nall that stuff, and that'll take\naffect for the life of that system and\n\n259\n00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:43.910\nnow I have true central management.\n\n260\n00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:45.350\nSo this sets us up,\n\n261\n00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:48.900\nthis is that first step on that\njourney to being centrally managed.\n\n262\n00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:52.020\nBut if I stop here,\nI'm not actually centrally managed yet.\n\n263\n00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:53.170\n>> Sure.\n\n264\n00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:56.650\n>> All right, so let's start with\nthe simplest of these image types,\n\n265\n00:11:56.650 --> 00:11:59.050\nand that is the disc image, right.\n\n266\n00:11:59.050 --> 00:12:01.390\nSo we're gonna take a look at disc images,\nand how they work.\n\n267\n00:12:01.390 --> 00:12:03.540\nThese are probably the ones\nthat are the most common.\n\n268\n00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:04.900\nA lot of you out there,\n\n269\n00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:07.052\nif you work in a business environment\nmaybe you've done NetInstall,\n\n270\n00:12:07.052 --> 00:12:11.050\nNetRestore or NetBoot, maybe you done\nthose before, but maybe you haven't.\n\n271\n00:12:11.050 --> 00:12:13.660\nAnd if you haven't really worked in\nthe business environment then you probably\n\n272\n00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:17.250\nonly dealt with DMGs, disc images,\nvery very common files.\n\n273\n00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:20.510\nAny time you going to download\nsoftware is almost always a .dmg\n\n274\n00:12:20.510 --> 00:12:23.490\nfile that you're downloading and\nit's an image of a disk.\n\n275\n00:12:23.490 --> 00:12:25.400\nAnd when you double click on it,\n\n276\n00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:30.544\nit appears on your computer as\na disk just sitting right there.\n\n277\n00:12:30.544 --> 00:12:35.960\nFor example, here, I'll take my computer\nand if I just go to My Downloads folder,\n\n278\n00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:39.160\nI'm sure I have downloaded\na ton of .dmg files.\n\n279\n00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:41.150\nIn fact here, you can see I've got a ton.\n\n280\n00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:44.060\nNow these are all different\nfiles that I've downloaded.\n\n281\n00:12:44.060 --> 00:12:47.000\nAnd so you'll see things that I've\ndownloaded like Java for OS X,\n\n282\n00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.820\nthe Java Runtime environment, XQuartz,\nBlackmagic converters, and so on.\n\n283\n00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:53.130\nThis is all various software\nthat I've used, right?\n\n284\n00:12:53.130 --> 00:12:54.180\nSo like Virtual Box.\n\n285\n00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:56.180\nVirtual Box is a virtualization\nsoftware and so\n\n286\n00:12:56.180 --> 00:12:58.930\nI downloaded it and\nthey gave me a .dmg file.\n\n287\n00:12:58.930 --> 00:13:01.060\nI'm gonna copy that to my desktop.\n\n288\n00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:03.990\nAnd so\nwhen I copy it over it's just right there,\n\n289\n00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:06.320\nit's a .dmg file, nothing too fancy.\n\n290\n00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:09.440\nAnd when I double click\non that what happens?\n\n291\n00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:13.310\nWell, see how it says, opening the .dmg,\nand it's verifying it.\n\n292\n00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:15.420\nIt's checking it to make\nsure it's not corrupt.\n\n293\n00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:20.500\nAnd assuming it's fine, for just\na brief moment there it said mounting.\n\n294\n00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:22.400\nIt mounts it like a hard drive.\n\n295\n00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:24.760\nAnd when it's done, I see this, right?\n\n296\n00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:28.310\nI see VirtualBox, I see it's got\na package in here that I can install.\n\n297\n00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:31.900\nThat's the actual application, and\nthey want me to double click on that and\n\n298\n00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:34.900\nthen I can go to Applications and\nfind the applications, very exciting.\n\n299\n00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:40.270\nBut, what's going on behind the scenes,\nis that it shows up, like a hard drive.\n\n300\n00:13:40.270 --> 00:13:44.080\nSo right there, I can see that I've\ngot this VirtualBox hard drive\n\n301\n00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:45.580\nsitting right there.\n\n302\n00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:47.230\nThat's that disk image.\n\n303\n00:13:47.230 --> 00:13:53.000\nSomebody somewhere made this image and\nwhen I double-clicked on it,\n\n304\n00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.870\nit knows the image file's right there,\nbut it mounted it like a hard drive.\n\n305\n00:13:56.870 --> 00:13:59.330\nAnd we can see that if we\njump into our terminal.\n\n306\n00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:03.480\nAnd, kind of browse into where\nour hard drives get mounted.\n\n307\n00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:06.190\nSo, in our terminal whenever you\n\n308\n00:14:06.190 --> 00:14:10.190\nattach a hard drive it gets mounted\ninto these slash volumes folder.\n\n309\n00:14:10.190 --> 00:14:15.760\nAnd if I jump in there, see how I've\ngot a folder called VirtualBox.\n\n310\n00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:17.990\nNow, I don't have an actual\nhard drive called VirtualBox.\n\n311\n00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:20.610\nI have a hard drive called Macintosh HD.\n\n312\n00:14:20.610 --> 00:14:22.810\nI've got a hard drive called external SSD.\n\n313\n00:14:22.810 --> 00:14:26.940\nThose I have, but VirtualBox,\nthat's that .dmg file.\n\n314\n00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:29.380\nThat's now mounted as if\nit were a hard drive and so\n\n315\n00:14:29.380 --> 00:14:33.200\nI can browse into that and there's\nthe files that we saw a minute ago,\n\n316\n00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:35.550\nyou'll see the packets,\nthe .pkg files sitting right there.\n\n317\n00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:37.510\nSo its treating it like a hard drive, and\n\n318\n00:14:37.510 --> 00:14:41.610\nif I go into the Disc Utility, so I'm just\ngoing to fire up the Disc Utility here,\n\n319\n00:14:41.610 --> 00:14:44.090\nit'll show up in here\nas a hard drive also.\n\n320\n00:14:44.090 --> 00:14:48.580\nSo looking at my list of disks right\nhere under Disk Images, I can see\n\n321\n00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:54.120\nan Apple UDIF read-only compressed (bzip2)\nMedia, rolls right off the tongue.\n\n322\n00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:57.270\nAnd there's that VirtualBox hard drive.\n\n323\n00:14:57.270 --> 00:14:59.540\nSo this is the first\nexample of a disk image.\n\n324\n00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:02.240\nWe've made of an image disk somewhere.\n\n325\n00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:03.630\nSomebody at Oracle,\n\n326\n00:15:03.630 --> 00:15:07.950\ncuz Oracle made VirtualBox, somebody\nat Oracle sat down and made this file.\n\n327\n00:15:07.950 --> 00:15:11.730\nAnd while we might not use this for\ndeploying operating systems, we can use it\n\n328\n00:15:11.730 --> 00:15:15.430\nfor deploying software, and so you might\nneed to make one of these yourself.\n\n329\n00:15:15.430 --> 00:15:18.540\nMore importantly you might get\nquestions on this on the exams, so\n\n330\n00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:22.120\nI want to show you guys how to make\nthese .dmg files, and how they work.\n\n331\n00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:23.810\nSo let's say that we want to make our own,\n\n332\n00:15:23.810 --> 00:15:27.640\nwe want to distribute some kind\nof software using a .dmg file.\n\n333\n00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:30.700\nWell, we're actually gonna use\nthe Disk Utility to do it.\n\n334\n00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:33.730\nSo let me ditch some of these other\nwindows that I've broken open here.\n\n335\n00:15:33.730 --> 00:15:36.760\nAnd I'm just gonna start right\nhere on my Disk Utility.\n\n336\n00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:39.050\nLet's say that I've got some\nsoftware I wanna distribute.\n\n337\n00:15:39.050 --> 00:15:40.220\nLet me find some software here.\n\n338\n00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:43.190\nLet's do, how about iBooks?\n\n339\n00:15:43.190 --> 00:15:44.780\nEverybody likes iBooks, right?\n\n340\n00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:46.710\nSo I'm just gonna take iBooks,\n\n341\n00:15:46.710 --> 00:15:51.550\nand I wanna distribute the iBook\nsoftware out to my users.\n\n342\n00:15:51.550 --> 00:15:55.144\nSo I'm gonna create .dmg\nfile that contains iBooks.\n\n343\n00:15:55.144 --> 00:15:58.412\nSo inside of the Disk Utility\nwhat you can do is,\n\n344\n00:15:58.412 --> 00:16:01.126\nwell you can do a few different things.\n\n345\n00:16:01.126 --> 00:16:04.458\nIf you go up to your Images\nmenu in the disk utility,\n\n346\n00:16:04.458 --> 00:16:07.335\nSee how you've got Scan Image for Restore?\n\n347\n00:16:07.335 --> 00:16:11.041\nThat lets you take an image that already\nexists and bring it in to Disk Utility so\n\n348\n00:16:11.041 --> 00:16:13.200\nyou can then restore it somewhere else.\n\n349\n00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:15.710\nBut I'm not ready to restore,\nI'm trying to make something.\n\n350\n00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:18.910\nAnd if you want to make something, you've\ngotta go under your Disk Utility menu, or\n\n351\n00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:20.840\nI'm sorry, under your File menu,\nthere we go.\n\n352\n00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:23.150\nAnd under File, you've got New Image.\n\n353\n00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:26.300\nAnd here's where we've got\na few different options.\n\n354\n00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:28.640\nAnd one option is to make a Blank Image.\n\n355\n00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:33.770\nI can just make an empty DMG file, and\nthen I can throw files into it later.\n\n356\n00:16:33.770 --> 00:16:35.760\nThat's one way to go about it.\n\n357\n00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:41.580\nOr if everything I want to package is in a\nfolder, I can turn that folder into a DMG.\n\n358\n00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:43.900\nSo if I put all of my\nsoftware elements together,\n\n359\n00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:47.210\nI can then choose to make a DMG out\nof that and then it'll build it.\n\n360\n00:16:47.210 --> 00:16:50.520\nOr I can make a DMG\nfile from a hard drive.\n\n361\n00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:53.770\nAnd so see how I've got this\nVirtualBox is showing up here?\n\n362\n00:16:53.770 --> 00:16:54.930\nI can make a DMG based on that.\n\n363\n00:16:54.930 --> 00:16:58.420\nSo if I have physical disk,\nlike my external SSD.\n\n364\n00:16:58.420 --> 00:16:59.530\nSo here's my external SSD,\n\n365\n00:16:59.530 --> 00:17:04.090\nand if I look at it, inside of that\nexternal SSD I've got some data.\n\n366\n00:17:04.090 --> 00:17:05.940\nWhat do I have in that thing?\n\n367\n00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:06.860\nLet's find out.\n\n368\n00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:09.870\nSo, if I take my external SSD,\nI've got some installers.\n\n369\n00:17:09.870 --> 00:17:13.050\nRight, so I've got an El Capitan\ninstaller and a Yosemite installer so\n\n370\n00:17:13.050 --> 00:17:16.000\nthis is actually about\nprobably 10 gigs of data here.\n\n371\n00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.620\nIf I wanna make an image of that,\n\n372\n00:17:18.620 --> 00:17:22.620\nwell in the Disk Utility I just need\nto highlight the External SSD first.\n\n373\n00:17:22.620 --> 00:17:23.340\nSo I'm gonna highlight that.\n\n374\n00:17:23.340 --> 00:17:28.953\nAnd then you can go up to File >\nNew Image > Image from External SSD.\n\n375\n00:17:28.953 --> 00:17:32.630\nAnd it will create a DMG file\nbased on that hard drive.\n\n376\n00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:35.565\nAnd you could do that for\nan entire computer if you want.\n\n377\n00:17:35.565 --> 00:17:38.340\nOn the desk next to me here,\nI've got a Mac Mini, and\n\n378\n00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:41.240\nthe Mac Mini has been\nbooted up into target mode.\n\n379\n00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:44.040\nAnd in target mode it shows\nup as an external hard drive,\n\n380\n00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:48.780\nthat's what this, if you're wondering\nwhy I had two Macintosh HDs, right?\n\n381\n00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:51.090\nSee I have one Macintosh HD\nthat's internal,\n\n382\n00:17:51.090 --> 00:17:53.330\nthat's the SSD that's in my laptop.\n\n383\n00:17:53.330 --> 00:17:55.970\nBut then I've got this other Macintosh HD,\n\n384\n00:17:55.970 --> 00:17:59.820\nthat's this Mac Mini hooked up in target\nmode, so I see it as a hard drive.\n\n385\n00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:05.130\nSo if I wanna make an image of that\nentire computer, I can do that, right?\n\n386\n00:18:05.130 --> 00:18:07.500\nNow, I'll have some\nchallenges if I wanna do it.\n\n387\n00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:12.134\nFor example, the hard drive in\nmy laptop is 500 megs in size.\n\n388\n00:18:12.134 --> 00:18:18.640\nOkay, the hard drive in that Mac Mini is\na terabyte, it's bigger than my laptop.\n\n389\n00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:22.736\nSo if I try and do a straight up image\nof it, it's gonna image the whole drive.\n\n390\n00:18:22.736 --> 00:18:26.480\nIt'll create a 1 terabyte file,\nit's too big for my computer.\n\n391\n00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:29.825\nBut DMGs do support compression and\nwhen you compress them,\n\n392\n00:18:29.825 --> 00:18:32.523\nthey only take the amount\nof space that's used.\n\n393\n00:18:32.523 --> 00:18:36.820\nAnd on this Mac you'll see it's actually\nusing very, very little of its space.\n\n394\n00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:38.510\nSo I'm gonna make an image of that.\n\n395\n00:18:38.510 --> 00:18:43.641\nI'm gonna take that Macintosh hard drive,\nI'm gonna go up here to File > New Image,\n\n396\n00:18:43.641 --> 00:18:46.583\nand I'll create an image\nfrom the Macintosh HD.\n\n397\n00:18:46.583 --> 00:18:49.580\nAnd when I choose that,\nit's gonna ask me a few questions.\n\n398\n00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:50.650\nI'm gonna save it to make desktop and\n\n399\n00:18:50.650 --> 00:18:55.610\nI'm just called this my Mac mini Image,\nI'll save it right to my desktop.\n\n400\n00:18:55.610 --> 00:19:00.710\nThe format is read-only, but if I drop\nthat down, I got a few different choices.\n\n401\n00:19:00.710 --> 00:19:02.200\nNow I'm gonna choose compressed.\n\n402\n00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:04.370\nI need it to be compressed cuz otherwise\nI don't have enough hard drive\n\n403\n00:19:04.370 --> 00:19:06.020\nspace for this thing.\n\n404\n00:19:06.020 --> 00:19:08.220\nSo I'm gonna choose compressed,\nand I'll hit Save.\n\n405\n00:19:09.430 --> 00:19:12.480\nWhat's gonna happen now is\nit's gonna start reading\n\n406\n00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:14.428\nthe hard drive from that Mac Mini.\n\n407\n00:19:14.428 --> 00:19:18.293\nIts a terabyte in size but there's only,\nI don't really know how much is in there.\n\n408\n00:19:18.293 --> 00:19:22.440\nIt says 13.88 gigabytes,\nright down here, is actually used.\n\n409\n00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:25.800\nSo it's about to read 13.88 gigs,\nand then it's gonna write it.\n\n410\n00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:27.711\nNow I do need to be an administrator so\n\n411\n00:19:27.711 --> 00:19:31.363\nI have to kinda clear the credential\nhurdle here, and we'll do that.\n\n412\n00:19:31.363 --> 00:19:33.330\nAnd it's then gonna start\nwriting that image.\n\n413\n00:19:33.330 --> 00:19:35.280\nSo it's gonna churn along,\nand there it goes.\n\n414\n00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:39.731\nSee how it says Reading whole disk,\nit's gonna read that whole thing,\n\n415\n00:19:39.731 --> 00:19:41.003\nit's a 1 TB drive.\n\n416\n00:19:41.003 --> 00:19:43.870\nMost of it's empty though so\nthis'll happen pretty quick.\n\n417\n00:19:43.870 --> 00:19:46.360\nIf you've got data on your drive\nthough this can take a long time.\n\n418\n00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:51.040\nIf I had a full terabyte of data on there\nI might need to go take a lunch break and\n\n419\n00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:53.720\ncome back for part two and\nfinish this later.\n\n420\n00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:57.240\nBut since it's only a handful of data,\nabout 13 gigs, and it's gonna get\n\n421\n00:19:57.240 --> 00:20:00.630\ncompressed and become even smaller,\nthis should happen pretty quickly.\n\n422\n00:20:00.630 --> 00:20:02.780\nNow, I'm using Thunderbolt,\nso that'll be kinda fast.\n\n423\n00:20:02.780 --> 00:20:05.830\nBut if you're using FireWire,\nor USB, or something like that,\n\n424\n00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:08.940\nthen it might be slower and\nit could take you even longer.\n\n425\n00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:12.030\nAll right, so that one's gonna churn\nalong, it's gonna create that image.\n\n426\n00:20:12.030 --> 00:20:16.940\nThat's one example of a DMG,\nI'm creating a DMG file of this computer.\n\n427\n00:20:16.940 --> 00:20:19.020\nNow what can I do with that DMG?\n\n428\n00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:21.158\nWell, the short answer is not a whole lot.\n\n429\n00:20:21.158 --> 00:20:26.210\n[LAUGH] So I can't really restore it,\ncuz if I restore it, it's not bootable.\n\n430\n00:20:26.210 --> 00:20:27.211\nI could restore it, but\n\n431\n00:20:27.211 --> 00:20:29.923\nthen I'd have to take extra steps\nto make that system bootable.\n\n432\n00:20:29.923 --> 00:20:34.110\nSo in the Mac world at bootable\npartition is called, blessed.\n\n433\n00:20:34.110 --> 00:20:37.341\nA blessed partition is one that has\nthe proper entries for the boot loader,\n\n434\n00:20:37.341 --> 00:20:39.143\nthat's allowed to fire up and function.\n\n435\n00:20:39.143 --> 00:20:42.519\nWe'll see that if I were to restore this,\nit's not blessed, and so\n\n436\n00:20:42.519 --> 00:20:44.130\nI'd have to go that extra step.\n\n437\n00:20:44.130 --> 00:20:46.699\nWell, we're gonna see that in another\nepisode when we start talking about\n\n438\n00:20:46.699 --> 00:20:47.610\ndeploying these things.\n\n439\n00:20:47.610 --> 00:20:51.021\nBut for right now, just know that this\none won't be so its not really bootable.\n\n440\n00:20:51.021 --> 00:20:53.330\nBut I could use it to recover files,\nright?\n\n441\n00:20:53.330 --> 00:20:56.740\nI've got a snapshot of this machine at\na certain point and time it'll be a DMG.\n\n442\n00:20:56.740 --> 00:21:01.580\nI could mount that DMG on any Mac here\nin the building and browse into it and\n\n443\n00:21:01.580 --> 00:21:02.610\nget files out of it.\n\n444\n00:21:02.610 --> 00:21:06.188\nI've basically got a portable\ntime machine backup, right?\n\n445\n00:21:06.188 --> 00:21:09.240\nIt's a backup of this computer\nthat I can then send wherever and\n\n446\n00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:10.210\nhave access to those files.\n\n447\n00:21:10.210 --> 00:21:13.830\nSo that's really the utility for\nit as far as imaging a system.\n\n448\n00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:16.380\nBut normally we're doing it for\nsoftware, right?\n\n449\n00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:20.050\nI just want to distribute some software\nand that's what I'm gonna use and\n\n450\n00:21:20.050 --> 00:21:22.960\nso I need to be able to\npackage those together.\n\n451\n00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:28.120\nWell, if we wanna do software, you need to\ncreate a DMG that's not based on a disk,\n\n452\n00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:30.700\nbut it's basically just a container in and\nof itself.\n\n453\n00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:33.630\nAnd when you do that, you've gotta\nbe really careful because DMGs,\n\n454\n00:21:33.630 --> 00:21:36.820\nby default, have a fixed size.\n\n455\n00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:39.010\nSo when I make a DMG I have to\ntell it what size I want it to be.\n\n456\n00:21:39.010 --> 00:21:42.230\nI can tell it hey I want it\nto be 100 megabytes in size.\n\n457\n00:21:42.230 --> 00:21:45.470\nAnd when I do that,\nit'll make a 100 megabyte file.\n\n458\n00:21:45.470 --> 00:21:49.355\nEven if the file is completely empty\nit will still be 100 megabytes.\n\n459\n00:21:49.355 --> 00:21:52.150\nThe DMG contains a bit-for-bit\n\n460\n00:21:52.150 --> 00:21:56.460\nreplica of whatever data it is you're\nputting in there, including empty bits.\n\n461\n00:21:56.460 --> 00:22:02.520\nSo when I create my own DMGs, I've\ngotta pick between doing a traditional\n\n462\n00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:08.190\nfixed DMG, that's just the normal one,\nor what's called a sparse disk image.\n\n463\n00:22:08.190 --> 00:22:11.337\nAnd a sparse disk image is where it says,\nif there's empty blocks,\n\n464\n00:22:11.337 --> 00:22:13.173\ndon't bother putting those in there.\n\n465\n00:22:13.173 --> 00:22:15.160\nRight, why have blocks that\nrepresent something empty?\n\n466\n00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:16.790\nAnd just leave those out.\n\n467\n00:22:16.790 --> 00:22:20.020\nAnd so now if I create\na 100 megabyte DMG file and\n\n468\n00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:23.180\nI don't put anything it,\nit'll be significantly smaller.\n\n469\n00:22:23.180 --> 00:22:25.995\nAnd as I put data in there\nthe file will grow and grow and\n\n470\n00:22:25.995 --> 00:22:27.443\ngrow to match that, okay?\n\n471\n00:22:27.443 --> 00:22:30.169\nSo I wanna show you guys an example\nof that so you can see it.\n\n472\n00:22:30.169 --> 00:22:31.570\nIt's important to remember for the exam.\n\n473\n00:22:31.570 --> 00:22:34.420\nAnd my disk image of that\nMac Mini just finished.\n\n474\n00:22:34.420 --> 00:22:36.600\nI can see right here,\nOperation successful,\n\n475\n00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:38.410\nit finished imaging that system.\n\n476\n00:22:38.410 --> 00:22:43.050\nIt took two and a half minutes,\nand I can see here my file size.\n\n477\n00:22:44.060 --> 00:22:48.723\nI saw, back here in my disk manager,\nthat we were using 13.88 gigs.\n\n478\n00:22:48.723 --> 00:22:50.355\nBut my disk image is only seven and\n\n479\n00:22:50.355 --> 00:22:52.933\na half gigs, and\nthat's cuz it compressed it down.\n\n480\n00:22:52.933 --> 00:22:56.580\nAnd I don't have to worry about that\ndisk being a terabyte when mine isn't.\n\n481\n00:22:56.580 --> 00:23:04.443\nAnd if look on my desktop, I've got my Mac\nMini Image.dmg, that's what I just made.\n\n482\n00:23:04.443 --> 00:23:09.476\nAnd if I pull up its information,\nit's seven and a half gigs.\n\n483\n00:23:09.476 --> 00:23:13.030\nRight, there's that DMG and I can mount it\nand browse into it and see all the files\n\n484\n00:23:13.030 --> 00:23:15.920\nthat were on that Mac Mini,\nI've now got a copy of it, all right.\n\n485\n00:23:17.010 --> 00:23:19.850\nSo let's take a look at creating\na DMG from scratch, right.\n\n486\n00:23:19.850 --> 00:23:24.943\nSo if I come in here to my Macintosh hard\ndrive, and I want to distribute iBooks.\n\n487\n00:23:24.943 --> 00:23:28.410\nI think that was the example I gave,\nwhat, feels like forever ago now.\n\n488\n00:23:28.410 --> 00:23:33.523\nAnd I'm gonna go up here to File > New\nImage, and I'm gonna create a Blank Image.\n\n489\n00:23:33.523 --> 00:23:35.587\nAll right,\nwe're just gonna make a blank one, and\n\n490\n00:23:35.587 --> 00:23:37.630\nI'll put the data in there myself.\n\n491\n00:23:37.630 --> 00:23:39.210\nNow when I go to create it\nI need to give it a name.\n\n492\n00:23:39.210 --> 00:23:42.460\nAnd so maybe I'll say this is\niBooks version, well here,\n\n493\n00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:44.390\nI need to give it a file name.\n\n494\n00:23:44.390 --> 00:23:50.075\nSo we'll just say ibooks-v1.2.\n\n495\n00:23:50.075 --> 00:23:51.731\nI don't know what version\niBooks is on right now, so\n\n496\n00:23:51.731 --> 00:23:53.133\nI'll just say version 1.2, all right?\n\n497\n00:23:53.133 --> 00:23:56.850\nI'm gonna save it to my desktop,\nand I'll give it a nice name.\n\n498\n00:23:56.850 --> 00:23:59.746\nNow the Save As, that's the file name.\n\n499\n00:23:59.746 --> 00:24:03.014\nThe name here is the name that'll show\nup on the desktop when it's mounted.\n\n500\n00:24:03.014 --> 00:24:04.762\nSo it's nice to give\nit a pretty name here.\n\n501\n00:24:04.762 --> 00:24:07.525\nSo I'll say this is iBooks v1.2.\n\n502\n00:24:07.525 --> 00:24:10.227\nAnd I'm gonna make it a 100MB just\nlike I said in a minute ago, right?\n\n503\n00:24:10.227 --> 00:24:11.446\nSo, just a 100 megs.\n\n504\n00:24:11.446 --> 00:24:14.451\nIt's gonna be formatted OS X Extended,\nright?\n\n505\n00:24:14.451 --> 00:24:16.910\nIt's like a regular hardrive,\nyou gotta format it.\n\n506\n00:24:16.910 --> 00:24:19.340\nAnd so, I could choose to go ExFAT or\nwhatever,\n\n507\n00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:22.730\nbut we typically want the OS X Extended.\n\n508\n00:24:22.730 --> 00:24:25.580\nAnd then, down here at the bottom\nI can pick the image format.\n\n509\n00:24:25.580 --> 00:24:27.340\nAnd the default is\na read write disk image.\n\n510\n00:24:27.340 --> 00:24:29.880\nThat's the normal mode that we want.\n\n511\n00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:34.960\nAnd if I do that, I'm telling it to create\na 100 MB file, it's going to be 100 MBs.\n\n512\n00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:37.110\nThat's what it's going to create.\n\n513\n00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:38.290\nSo, I'm gonna go ahead and hit Save.\n\n514\n00:24:38.290 --> 00:24:40.110\nAnd it's gonna create that one.\n\n515\n00:24:40.110 --> 00:24:41.210\nAll right.\n\n516\n00:24:41.210 --> 00:24:44.520\nThe larger the DMG you created,\nthe longer it'll take to create.\n\n517\n00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:46.200\nMine's only 100 MBs, so\nit'll create really fast.\n\n518\n00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:48.700\nI'm gonna do another one.\n\n519\n00:24:48.700 --> 00:24:52.320\nSo, I'm just gonna go back to New Image,\nBlank Image.\n\n520\n00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:56.075\nAnd let's call this one ibooks-v1.3,\nall right?\n\n521\n00:24:56.075 --> 00:25:01.420\nSo, this will be another file,\nexcept this time,\n\n522\n00:25:01.420 --> 00:25:06.190\ninstead of doing the standard read write\ndisk image, I'm gonna change that.\n\n523\n00:25:06.190 --> 00:25:09.270\nAnd you'll see we've got\na few other options in here,\n\n524\n00:25:09.270 --> 00:25:12.630\nincluding the sparse disk image\nthat I mentioned earlier.\n\n525\n00:25:12.630 --> 00:25:18.440\nA sparse disk image is just like the DMG,\nexcept it leaves out the empty stuff.\n\n526\n00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:20.390\nWhy make a file that contains empty stuff?\n\n527\n00:25:20.390 --> 00:25:22.600\nWe can just leave that stuff out, okay?\n\n528\n00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:25.930\nSo, I'm gonna go ahead and\ndo that, and I'll hit Save.\n\n529\n00:25:25.930 --> 00:25:29.370\nAnd so, now,\nI've created two of these files.\n\n530\n00:25:29.370 --> 00:25:32.420\nAnd if I look on my desktop,\nwhere did those thing end up?\n\n531\n00:25:32.420 --> 00:25:34.480\nThey're way over here.\n\n532\n00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:35.410\nThere we go.\n\n533\n00:25:35.410 --> 00:25:37.320\nI can see I created these two files.\n\n534\n00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:39.330\nAnd I guess my head's kind\nof sitting on top of those.\n\n535\n00:25:40.380 --> 00:25:41.850\nBut I can see those two files.\n\n536\n00:25:41.850 --> 00:25:47.460\nI've got iBooks version 1.2 dot dmg, and\niBooks version 1.3 dot sparse image.\n\n537\n00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:48.720\nRight?\nSo, it's actually calling out\n\n538\n00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:53.060\nthe fact that it is a sparse image and\nnot a traditional DMG.\n\n539\n00:25:53.060 --> 00:25:56.790\nIt's a little bit different, and I can\ndouble click on those guys to mount them.\n\n540\n00:25:56.790 --> 00:25:58.380\nSo, that's what I'm gonna do.\n\n541\n00:25:58.380 --> 00:26:00.310\nSo, I'll mount the first one.\n\n542\n00:26:00.310 --> 00:26:04.020\nAnd then, I'll mount the second one, which\napparently it's gonna take it's time for,\n\n543\n00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:05.970\nI'm guessing cuz I still\nhave that window open.\n\n544\n00:26:05.970 --> 00:26:06.660\nThere we go.\n\n545\n00:26:06.660 --> 00:26:10.230\nAnd so, now I've got those two\nguys mounted right here, right?\n\n546\n00:26:10.230 --> 00:26:12.300\nAnd see how it's that friendly\nname that I typed in?\n\n547\n00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:13.420\nThat's why we have two names.\n\n548\n00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:17.500\nThe file name, and then the friendly\nname so that I can see those.\n\n549\n00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:20.430\nAnd what I'm gonna do now is\nI'm gonna take iBooks, and\n\n550\n00:26:20.430 --> 00:26:22.570\nif I look at iBooks, how big is it?\n\n551\n00:26:22.570 --> 00:26:25.700\nIt's 51 MB in size, right?\n\n552\n00:26:25.700 --> 00:26:30.220\nSo, 62.9 MB on disk, but\n51 MB in size of the actual file.\n\n553\n00:26:30.220 --> 00:26:34.920\nAnd I'm gonna send a copy\nof it to my version 1.2.\n\n554\n00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:37.010\nAnd I'll send a copy of it to version 1.3.\n\n555\n00:26:37.010 --> 00:26:39.190\nSo, I'm just gonna copy it to those guys.\n\n556\n00:26:39.190 --> 00:26:40.360\nAll right.\n\n557\n00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:46.668\nAnd if I browse into them, here's iBooks\nv1.2, and I can see iBooks is right there.\n\n558\n00:26:46.668 --> 00:26:50.110\nAnd iBooks v1.3,\nI can see it's got the file, too, right?\n\n559\n00:26:50.110 --> 00:26:52.330\nSo, both discs now contain that.\n\n560\n00:26:52.330 --> 00:26:54.520\nAnd if I go back up to my desktop and\n\n561\n00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:59.710\nI look at the details of these files,\nwhat I can see is the size.\n\n562\n00:26:59.710 --> 00:27:06.240\nAnd if you look, iBooks version\n1.2 is exactly 100 megabytes.\n\n563\n00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:11.830\nA DMG will be a fixed size,\neven the empty space, by default.\n\n564\n00:27:11.830 --> 00:27:13.363\nBut the sparse image?\n\n565\n00:27:13.363 --> 00:27:15.827\n37.8, right?\n\n566\n00:27:15.827 --> 00:27:22.390\nNot only did it make an image of the file,\nit compressed it, too.\n\n567\n00:27:22.390 --> 00:27:25.572\nAnd it left out the empty space and\nends up being pretty small, okay?\n\n568\n00:27:25.572 --> 00:27:27.950\nAnd at the end of the day,\nthe sparseimage is a dmg.\n\n569\n00:27:27.950 --> 00:27:30.781\nI can rename it to a dot dmg,\nand it'll work just fine.\n\n570\n00:27:30.781 --> 00:27:33.198\nAnd that's what you'd normally\ndo before you distribute it, and\n\n571\n00:27:33.198 --> 00:27:34.548\nnobody distributes a sparseimage.\n\n572\n00:27:34.548 --> 00:27:36.120\nThey distribute a dmg, right?\n\n573\n00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:38.090\nSo, you can just rename that,\nand then you're in business.\n\n574\n00:27:38.090 --> 00:27:39.770\nThey'll work the same\nonce they're created.\n\n575\n00:27:39.770 --> 00:27:40.480\nBut that is important.\n\n576\n00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:45.740\nSo, on the exam, you'll see that\ndifference between a sparse disk image and\n\n577\n00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:47.810\na regular read write disk image.\n\n578\n00:27:47.810 --> 00:27:52.012\nRegular read write has a fixed size\nwhether you put data in it or not.\n\n579\n00:27:52.012 --> 00:27:52.800\nAll right.\n\n580\n00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:56.550\nOnce you've got these created, they can\nbe distributed however you want, right?\n\n581\n00:27:56.550 --> 00:28:00.060\nSo, if I go down here, I need to eject\nthem before I mess around with them.\n\n582\n00:28:00.060 --> 00:28:02.580\nSo, I'm just gonna eject\nthose two virtual disks.\n\n583\n00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:04.860\nAnd we'll give that a second\nwhile it gets rid of them.\n\n584\n00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:07.489\nAnd then, once they're gone, like I said,\n\n585\n00:28:07.489 --> 00:28:10.492\nI can rename that version\n1.3 file eventually.\n\n586\n00:28:10.492 --> 00:28:13.430\nWow, apparently really likes those files.\n\n587\n00:28:13.430 --> 00:28:14.480\nThere we go.\n\n588\n00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:17.870\nSo, I can take that version 1.3 file and\nI'm just gonna rename it.\n\n589\n00:28:17.870 --> 00:28:18.683\nSo, it's a dmg.\n\n590\n00:28:20.390 --> 00:28:22.230\nAnd we'll do that.\n\n591\n00:28:22.230 --> 00:28:23.090\nThere we go.\n\n592\n00:28:23.090 --> 00:28:26.540\nAnd now, I've effectively got two\nfiles that I can distribute out and\n\n593\n00:28:26.540 --> 00:28:31.130\npeople can use and be happy with and\nthe world is a safer place, right?\n\n594\n00:28:31.130 --> 00:28:33.520\nSo, this is what you're getting when\nyou download software from vendors.\n\n595\n00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:35.950\nThey're distributing these DMG files.\n\n596\n00:28:35.950 --> 00:28:39.430\nAll right, now that is one of\nthe file types, the image types,\n\n597\n00:28:39.430 --> 00:28:40.940\nthat we're going to talk\nabout in this series.\n\n598\n00:28:40.940 --> 00:28:43.895\nAnd it's probably the, I don't want\nto say it's the least important,\n\n599\n00:28:43.895 --> 00:28:46.190\ncuz there's exam questions and\nthat makes it important.\n\n600\n00:28:46.190 --> 00:28:49.260\nBut in real life land, it's the one\nyou're least likely to create, right?\n\n601\n00:28:49.260 --> 00:28:52.350\nBecause, normally, if you're a software\ndeveloper, then, yes, you'll create them.\n\n602\n00:28:52.350 --> 00:28:56.040\nBut otherwise, the rest of us are going\nto create Net Install, Net Boot, or\n\n603\n00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:56.990\nNet Restore images.\n\n604\n00:28:56.990 --> 00:29:00.040\nAnd those are the ones that we're gonna\ncover in the next couple of episodes.\n\n605\n00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:00.950\n>> All right, Don.\n\n606\n00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:01.950\nGreat information.\n\n607\n00:29:01.950 --> 00:29:03.170\nLot of good stuff in there.\n\n608\n00:29:03.170 --> 00:29:06.240\nWe're going to just touch base\nwith the different image types.\n\n609\n00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:06.762\nThey're coming up.\n\n610\n00:29:06.762 --> 00:29:09.170\nWe're gonna get into them\na lot more coming up.\n\n611\n00:29:09.170 --> 00:29:11.540\nDon, do you have anything else for\nus in this episode?\n\n612\n00:29:11.540 --> 00:29:12.770\n>> Those are the key things there.\n\n613\n00:29:12.770 --> 00:29:14.730\nJust remember those images\nwe created are not bootable.\n\n614\n00:29:14.730 --> 00:29:16.180\nI think I've probably\nsaid it 20 times now.\n\n615\n00:29:16.180 --> 00:29:17.370\nThat's a key element to remember.\n\n616\n00:29:17.370 --> 00:29:19.640\nAnd then, just remember the difference\nbetween a sparse image and\n\n617\n00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:21.080\na traditional DMG.\n\n618\n00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:22.200\nJust that size difference.\n\n619\n00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:23.630\nSo, the key components.\n\n620\n00:29:23.630 --> 00:29:24.130\n>> Very good.\n\n621\n00:29:24.130 --> 00:29:27.170\nWell, it looks like we've come to\nthe end of another exciting episode here\n\n622\n00:29:27.170 --> 00:29:28.080\nat ITProTV.\n\n623\n00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:32.180\nBut stick around, cuz we got plenty of\nmore episodes to come with Mac, here.\n\n624\n00:29:32.180 --> 00:29:34.820\nSo s,igning off for\nITPRO.TV, I'm Wes Brian.\n\n625\n00:29:34.820 --> 00:29:35.530\n>> And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n626\n00:29:35.530 --> 00:29:37.222\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n627\n00:29:37.222 --> 00:29:43.561\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

--> 00:00:17.361\nI'm your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n4\n00:00:17.361 --> 00:00:20.020\nIn todays episode we're\ngonna be continuing along\n\n5\n00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:24.310\nwith our Mac management basics 10.11,\nalso known as El Capitan.\n\n6\n00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:27.650\nAnd we've got Don Pezet here to\nhelp us out with our episode today.\n\n7\n00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:29.190\nDon, how you doing and welcome?\n\n8\n00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:30.460\n>> I'm doing swell, Wes,\n\n9\n00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.710\nready to jump right back in to\nthe world of Mac management basics.\n\n10\n00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.730\nAnd in this episode we're gonna be\ntaking a look at NetInstall, well,\n\n11\n00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:39.080\nand to a lesser extent, NetBoot also.\n\n12\n00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:40.140\nBuilding up NetInstall and\n\n13\n00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.310\nNetBoot images to be able to deploy Mac OS\nout to our production environments and\n\n14\n00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:48.600\nget hundred, thousands, tens of thousands\nof machines all set up simultaneously.\n\n15\n00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.400\nSo you'll see the process actually not\nthat complex it goes pretty smooth and\n\n16\n00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.811\nit's a really valuable asset to have for\na corporate environment.\n\n17\n00:00:56.811 --> 00:01:00.380\nAll right, well lets kick things off let\nme just do a quick recap of the difference\n\n18\n00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:06.330\nbetween net install and net boot right so\nNetBoot images are operating\n\n19\n00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.050\nsystem images that we build with Mac OS\nthat are available via the network.\n\n20\n00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:15.090\nAnd you can start up any Mac on your\nnetwork and it can find that NetBoot image\n\n21\n00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.540\nacross the network, it can load\nit locally, and boot up, and run.\n\n22\n00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:20.750\nAll right?\n\n23\n00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.580\nBut the key piece here is with NetBoot\nit doesn't install to the hard drive.\n\n24\n00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.830\nIt caches files on the hard drive but\nit doesn't actually install the OS.\n\n25\n00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:30.970\nSo if you power the computer off again,\nthat data's now gone.\n\n26\n00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:32.770\nAnd when you fire the computer back up,\n\n27\n00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.500\nit's gotta reload the operating\nsystem over the network again, right.\n\n28\n00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.300\nNetBoot is just designed to, like\nthe name implies, boot off the network.\n\n29\n00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:41.720\nJust to get us up and running.\n\n30\n00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.480\nIt's great for troubleshooting, for\ntesting, or in environments where we\n\n31\n00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:50.060\njust don't want our machines to save\nchanges, things like a student lab\n\n32\n00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.290\nwhere you might not want the students\nto modify things and it stays around.\n\n33\n00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:56.620\nHere you can just reboot the system and\nit'll come up nice and clean every time.\n\n34\n00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:58.530\nNetInstall is a little different.\n\n35\n00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.950\nYou boot up the computer,\nit reaches out on the network,\n\n36\n00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.330\nit finds the NetInstall image and now\ninstead of just loading it via network,\n\n37\n00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.200\nit actually installs it to the hard\ndrive so that the next time you boot up\n\n38\n00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.510\nyou just boot up off of your hard\ndrive instead of the network.\n\n39\n00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.890\nIt's a great way to get OS 10 installed or\neven upgraded on your system.\n\n40\n00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.170\nThe example I gave in the last episode,\nwas you might have 1,000 computers that\n\n41\n00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:25.780\nare out there that are all running OS\n10.10, right, so you're running Mavericks.\n\n42\n00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.670\nAnd you wanna upgrade, or\n10.10 is Yosemite, well, whatever.\n\n43\n00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.200\nWe want to upgrade to El Capitan, right?\n\n44\n00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.580\nSo when I wanna upgrade to El Capitan,\n\n45\n00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.510\nI could log in to the app store on all\n1,000 machines and install it that way.\n\n46\n00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.030\nBut I don't wanna log\nin on those machines.\n\n47\n00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.190\nI don't want to share credentials or\nwhatever.\n\n48\n00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.690\nSo instead I could take\nthe El Capitan installer and\n\n49\n00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.080\nserve it up as a NetInstall image.\n\n50\n00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.990\nAnd now when systems boot up\nthey can install from that and\n\n51\n00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:52.550\nthey don't even have to\nhave an iTunes account.\n\n52\n00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:55.040\nWe can push it out and\nget it deployed in our systems.\n\n53\n00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:00.000\nSo NetInstall installs locally,\nnet boot run temporarily.\n\n54\n00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.660\nThat's the big difference between the two.\n\n55\n00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.680\n>> Now with the imaged on itself,\nis this a stock image?\n\n56\n00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.520\nIs this something we can maybe leverage\nsome kind of customization if we need to\n\n57\n00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.650\npeek and tweak it to suit our needs if\nthe stock install doesn't, you know,\n\n58\n00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:12.760\nsuit what we're doing?\n\n59\n00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.150\nYeah, so normally we do kinda what I\nsaid a minute ago, which is we take the,\n\n60\n00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.560\nin this case the El Capitan installer and\nwe use that as our source image.\n\n61\n00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.410\nSo at a minimum,\nyou could just deploy that stock, right?\n\n62\n00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.540\nIt would be a, just like Apple\nintended installation of El Capitan.\n\n63\n00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:28.710\nAnd that works out great,\n\n64\n00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:32.140\nuse the El Capitan installer as\nyour source, and you're done.\n\n65\n00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:34.060\nBut usually we wanna do\na little more than that, right?\n\n66\n00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.370\nMaybe you wanna configure\nOpen Directory on the machines or\n\n67\n00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.540\nyou wanna have some kind of help desk\nuser account created or some other\n\n68\n00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:45.220\nconfiguration change on the system may\nbe as simple as changing the wallpaper.\n\n69\n00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:46.240\nWell, you can do that.\n\n70\n00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:50.490\nYou can customized your NetInstall images\nand your NetBoot images to contain\n\n71\n00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:54.740\nthe changes that make it match your\nenvironment, so it's really up to you.\n\n72\n00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:58.250\nYou can do stock, that's the easiest, or\nyou can tweak it and change it, and so\n\n73\n00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:59.550\nthat's what we're gonna\nlook at in this episode.\n\n74\n00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:04.480\nWe're gonna start with just kinda building\na stock image and getting that set up, and\n\n75\n00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.400\nthen we'll move on to creating one\nthat's customized that has a lot of\n\n76\n00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.450\nadditional bells and whistles or changes\nor whatever it is that we want to modify.\n\n77\n00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:14.620\n>> Very good, and in the last episode\nyou did mention a tool that we can use,\n\n78\n00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:15.630\nthe Disk Utility.\n\n79\n00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:18.390\nNow, Don, is that something that\nwe're gonna use, the Disk Utility,\n\n80\n00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:20.790\nhere when we Start\nworking with net install?\n\n81\n00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:21.940\n>> No, it really isn't.\n\n82\n00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:25.270\nI mean, it's a great tool, but one of the\nthings I mentioned in the last episode was\n\n83\n00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:26.780\nthat Disk Utility has some problems.\n\n84\n00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:30.540\nIt doesn't make bootable images by\ndefault, it just makes these DMGs.\n\n85\n00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:35.280\nAnd it doesn't back up recovery\npartitions, so we can't\n\n86\n00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:39.380\nreally build more than one partition\nto the same DMG using Disk Utility.\n\n87\n00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:40.470\nFor that,\n\n88\n00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:44.350\nwe have a different utility we're gonna\nuse called the System Image Utility.\n\n89\n00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:47.330\nNow the System Image Utility,\nit's actually a part of Mac OS.\n\n90\n00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.770\nIf you're on a Mac, you've already got it.\n\n91\n00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:51.480\nBut it's kind of hidden away.\n\n92\n00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:52.690\nIt's not like our normal stuff.\n\n93\n00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:55.640\nYou know, normally,\nif I want to find the Disk Utility,\n\n94\n00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:57.550\nI would browse into my\napplications folder.\n\n95\n00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:58.950\nLet me do it here on my laptop.\n\n96\n00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:00.880\nI would browse into\nthe applications folder.\n\n97\n00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:05.220\nAnd in the applications folder I\nwould find the utilities folder,\n\n98\n00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:06.980\nwhich is buried way down in here.\n\n99\n00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:09.320\nAnd when I browse in the utilities folder,\n\n100\n00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:13.510\nthat's where I'm gonna see things like\nActivity Monitor and Disk Utility, right,\n\n101\n00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:15.330\nthat's what we were using\nin the last episode.\n\n102\n00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:17.010\nSo those utilities are right there.\n\n103\n00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:21.870\nBut if I look for the System Image\nUtility, it's not here, right?\n\n104\n00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:27.190\nThis is one of those that's kind of buried\naway deep in the dark confines of Mac OS.\n\n105\n00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:30.290\nIt's part of the operating system hidden\naway inside of what's called the core\n\n106\n00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:31.640\nservices, right?\n\n107\n00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:33.610\nIf you wanna find it the easiest way,\n\n108\n00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:35.430\nhonestly the easiest way\nis to just use Spotlight.\n\n109\n00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:40.140\nIf I do a Spotlight search and I type\nSystem Image Utility, It'll find it,\n\n110\n00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:43.710\nand then I can run it, and there we go,\nI'm in the System Image Utility, right?\n\n111\n00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:46.190\nBut if you ever want to actually\nfind it on the hard drive,\n\n112\n00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:47.190\nit's kind of buried away.\n\n113\n00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:48.460\nLet me show you where it is.\n\n114\n00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:53.340\nI’m just going to use finders Go Menu and\nI'll choose, Go to Folder.\n\n115\n00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:54.600\nYou can see, right?\n\n116\n00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:55.750\nI've done it before.\n\n117\n00:05:55.750 --> 00:06:00.270\nWhen you just go to folder you can\ntype this in and it's /System,\n\n118\n00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:07.050\nit's hidden away in the system folder,\n/Library/CoreServices/Applications.\n\n119\n00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:10.010\nIn that folder are a couple\nof special utilities,\n\n120\n00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:11.760\nutilities that Apple has set aside.\n\n121\n00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:14.610\nAnd I know that there's probably a few\nof you out there that are saying Don,\n\n122\n00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:17.170\nI think you're wrong, I'm pretty\nsure it's in the Utilities folder.\n\n123\n00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:18.660\nIt used to be, right?\n\n124\n00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:23.570\nBack in the day I think they changed\nit in 10.5 or 10.6, one of the Lions\n\n125\n00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:27.550\nwhere they changed it so that it\nwas going to be in this folder now.\n\n126\n00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:30.370\nSo back in the day yes it did used\nto be in that Utilities folder.\n\n127\n00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:31.810\nNot anymore, now it's here.\n\n128\n00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:35.470\nAnd if you browse that folder,\nwell it's a hidden folder by default.\n\n129\n00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:36.380\nI can't get to it.\n\n130\n00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:40.330\nSo I could turn on hidden folders in\nthe finder which is always a mess or\n\n131\n00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:41.190\nI could just type it in.\n\n132\n00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:45.880\nSo\n/System/Library/CoreServices/Applications\n\n133\n00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:47.300\nand when you browse into that folder,\n\n134\n00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:49.020\nyou'll see there's a couple\nof different things.\n\n135\n00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:51.680\nArchived utility,\ndirectory utility, and so on.\n\n136\n00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:53.010\nThe network utility.\n\n137\n00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:56.101\nThat's another one that used to be over\nin the regular utility folder, but\n\n138\n00:06:56.101 --> 00:06:58.860\nthe one that we want is this guy\nright here, System Image Utility.\n\n139\n00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:00.010\nThat's where it's parked.\n\n140\n00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:04.020\nAnd this is the one that's gonna let\nus create these installation images.\n\n141\n00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:09.100\nThis is the same tool that's gonna let us\ndo NetBoot, NetInstall, and NetRestore.\n\n142\n00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:11.560\nYou create all three of those\nusing the System Image Utility.\n\n143\n00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:15.570\nSo in this episode and in our next episode\nwe're get intimately familiar with this\n\n144\n00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:17.389\ntool, because we're gonna use it\nto make all these various images.\n\n145\n00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:21.260\nAlright now, when you fire this thing up,\n\n146\n00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.600\nthere's a few different things\nthat you might see here.\n\n147\n00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:24.890\nOkay.\n\n148\n00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:28.080\nFor example, you might just see a drop\ndown box that contains one item.\n\n149\n00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:29.880\nThis has no sources.\n\n150\n00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:33.610\nAnd if that's what you got, if it says no\nsources, then you can stop, you're done.\n\n151\n00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:36.290\nThere's nothing that it\ncan build an image from.\n\n152\n00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:38.930\nIt expects one of two things.\n\n153\n00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:43.950\nIt expects either an installer for\nOS 10 and it can be any version.\n\n154\n00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:47.958\nIt can be El Capitan, Maverick,\nYosemite, whatever it is that you have.\n\n155\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:51.078\nIt expects an installer for that or\n\n156\n00:07:51.078 --> 00:07:55.388\nan actual hard drive from\na computer hooked up.\n\n157\n00:07:55.388 --> 00:07:57.528\nNow, what do I mean by a hard drive for\na computer hooked up?\n\n158\n00:07:57.528 --> 00:08:01.224\nI mean, you take a A MacMini,\na MacBook, a MacPro,\n\n159\n00:08:01.224 --> 00:08:03.828\nwhatever get booted in target mode.\n\n160\n00:08:03.828 --> 00:08:07.000\nAnd when you boot it in target mode\nit'll show up as an external drive.\n\n161\n00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.790\nYou can hook it up to the computer and\nyou can build images from that.\n\n162\n00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:11.590\nWe're gonna see that with NetRestore.\n\n163\n00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:14.550\nNetRestore uses that pretty heavily,\nso we'll do that in the next episode.\n\n164\n00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:15.750\nBut for doing this, for\n\n165\n00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:20.490\ndoing net boot and net install, it's\nreally expecting an installation source.\n\n166\n00:08:20.490 --> 00:08:24.460\nSo I'm expected to have an installer and\non mine, I should have it, yeah.\n\n167\n00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:29.560\nSo if I drop it down, see how I've got\npackage only no OS installation, or\n\n168\n00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:32.560\ninstall OS ten El Capitan, right?\n\n169\n00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:34.390\nThat means it found the installer.\n\n170\n00:08:34.390 --> 00:08:37.790\nIf yours doesn't find the install, let me\nshow you what it's actually looking for.\n\n171\n00:08:37.790 --> 00:08:42.480\nI'm just gonna browse to my hard drive,\nand browse to my applications folder.\n\n172\n00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:45.990\nInside of your applications folder,\nit's looking for a file.\n\n173\n00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:49.740\nLet's see if we can find it here online,\nhere we go.\n\n174\n00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:53.680\nIt's looking for\nInstall OS X El Capitan, right?\n\n175\n00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:56.690\nNow notice I have installed\nOS X Yosemite also and\n\n176\n00:08:56.690 --> 00:08:57.900\nthat didn't show up in my drop down box.\n\n177\n00:08:58.970 --> 00:08:59.980\nWhy is that?\n\n178\n00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:01.560\nWell it takes the newest one to find.\n\n179\n00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:03.310\nApple is only distributing the older one.\n\n180\n00:09:03.310 --> 00:09:04.540\nThat's what it's gonna do.\n\n181\n00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:06.050\nSo if I was on Yosemite system,\n\n182\n00:09:06.050 --> 00:09:08.860\nI might be able to to build that\nYosemite net installed disk.\n\n183\n00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:12.310\nBut because I'm on an El Capitan system,\nit was looking for El Capitan and\n\n184\n00:09:12.310 --> 00:09:13.070\nthat's why I found.\n\n185\n00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:15.860\nBut it's looking for\nthat installer file right there and\n\n186\n00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:20.210\nthat installer file is the full\ninstallation of El Capitan.\n\n187\n00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:22.470\nSee how it's 6.2 gigs in size?\n\n188\n00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:23.870\nIt's not a regular application.\n\n189\n00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:26.590\nI'm not gonna run it and\nall of a sudden experience a machine.\n\n190\n00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:29.490\nI'm gonna run it, and it's gonna try and\nreinstall El Capitan.\n\n191\n00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:31.920\nAll right now, where did I get that file?\n\n192\n00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:33.040\nHow did I get it?\n\n193\n00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:36.800\nWell if you've got a brand new Mac\nthat's already running El Capitan,\n\n194\n00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:38.410\nyou're not going to have that file.\n\n195\n00:09:38.410 --> 00:09:42.300\nOr if you were running Yosemite and\nyou upgraded the El Capitan,\n\n196\n00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:44.010\nyou're not going to have that file.\n\n197\n00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:48.280\nYou have to go out and get it and the way\nyou get it through the Mac app store.\n\n198\n00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:51.400\nSo you'll need to take a machine and\nfire up your app store.\n\n199\n00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:57.790\nIn the Mac app store you can just\ndo a search for El Capitan, right?\n\n200\n00:09:57.790 --> 00:10:01.840\nAnd maybe you're watching this show on\nthe next version of OS X that's come out,\n\n201\n00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:04.020\nyou just search for\nwhatever that current version is,\n\n202\n00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:07.240\nwhatever crazy monument they've\nnamed it after this time.\n\n203\n00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:09.360\nSo you'll go ahead and find that, but\n\n204\n00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:14.380\nnotice how I've got it right here,\nOS X El Capitan, and it's got download.\n\n205\n00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:15.540\nI'm already running El Capitan.\n\n206\n00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:18.310\nI don't need to install it,\nI need to download it.\n\n207\n00:10:18.310 --> 00:10:20.230\nAnd so I can come in here and\nI can choose to download it.\n\n208\n00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:23.870\nAnd if you do that, they don't\ncharge any money for it, it's free.\n\n209\n00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:25.280\nAnd it'll download.\n\n210\n00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:27.550\nIt's 6.2 gigs,\nit'll take a while to download it,\n\n211\n00:10:27.550 --> 00:10:29.490\nespecially if it just came out.\n\n212\n00:10:29.490 --> 00:10:32.950\nWhen these things come out, the app\nstore gets hammered for these files.\n\n213\n00:10:32.950 --> 00:10:35.300\nIt can take days for\nit to actually finish.\n\n214\n00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:38.640\nBut, if you do it now,\nit usually takes about an hour, right?\n\n215\n00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:41.410\nAnd it'll download from Apple, and\nnow you'll have that installer.\n\n216\n00:10:41.410 --> 00:10:44.660\nSo if you're missing the installer,\njust go in the app store, search for\n\n217\n00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:48.750\nOS10, or OSX, El Capitan, and hit that\ndownload link and you'll download it.\n\n218\n00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:51.120\nYou do have to sign in for it,\nso, do it on your laptop or\n\n219\n00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:53.300\nwhatever, you only have\nto download it once.\n\n220\n00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:56.800\nI always download these and I copy them\nto an external drive I keep in my office.\n\n221\n00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:00.040\nAnd so I've got this external drive\nthat has installers for the last\n\n222\n00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:04.740\nprobably six versions of OS 10 and\nyou just never know when you'll need one.\n\n223\n00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:06.120\nI like to keep them around.\n\n224\n00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:08.490\nBut you can them copy it between\ncomputers to your heart's content.\n\n225\n00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:13.730\nAll right so once we've got that file\nthough now we're ready to get in there and\n\n226\n00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:19.540\nbuild that net install image or\na net boot image for that matter, right?\n\n227\n00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:20.350\nSo I'm gonna come in here.\n\n228\n00:11:20.350 --> 00:11:21.660\nI'm gonna tell it what I want.\n\n229\n00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:25.970\nI'll tell it that I want to\ndo OS 10 El Capitan, right?\n\n230\n00:11:25.970 --> 00:11:29.830\nAnd then when I hit next on the next\nscreen it ask me what I'm doing.\n\n231\n00:11:29.830 --> 00:11:31.900\nAnd see how it's defaulted to NetInstall?\n\n232\n00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:33.370\nBecause that's what Apple\nassumes you're gonna do.\n\n233\n00:11:33.370 --> 00:11:34.520\nThat's the most common one.\n\n234\n00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:37.530\nI'm wanna install El Capitan on\nas many machines as possible, so\n\n235\n00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:39.210\nI'm gonna go NetInstall Image.\n\n236\n00:11:39.210 --> 00:11:42.280\nBut if I wanna do NetBoot,\nI can choose it right here, right.\n\n237\n00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:43.280\nI'm gonna build a NetBoot image.\n\n238\n00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:46.350\nGreat, a NetBoot image doesn't\ninstall on the hard drive,\n\n239\n00:11:46.350 --> 00:11:50.370\nit runs cached on the system,\nit runs in RAM and it just does.\n\n240\n00:11:50.370 --> 00:11:53.840\nWhat it does until you reboot\nthe system and then it's gone, right?\n\n241\n00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:56.490\nAt the end of the day the images\nare basically the same.\n\n242\n00:11:56.490 --> 00:11:59.280\nIt's basically the same image, it's just\nwhether or not we choose to install.\n\n243\n00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:03.460\nAnd so we're telling it right here how\nthis image is going to be deployed.\n\n244\n00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:07.730\nAnd you need to make that decision right\nhere cuz it's very difficult to convert\n\n245\n00:12:07.730 --> 00:12:10.373\none to the other later on, even though\nthe image types are very similar.\n\n246\n00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:14.530\nSo I want to do a Netinstall image,\nso I’m gonna choose that.\n\n247\n00:12:14.530 --> 00:12:15.940\nAnd I’ll just hit next on that one.\n\n248\n00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:19.460\nAnd now I've gotta sign\nmy license agreement.\n\n249\n00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:23.480\nNow when you first power up a brand new\nMac, you see the license agreement and\n\n250\n00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:24.750\nyou have to agree to it.\n\n251\n00:12:24.750 --> 00:12:27.300\nBut I might be doing\nan automated installation, so\n\n252\n00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:29.520\nthe end user never clicks on anything.\n\n253\n00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:31.610\nWho's gonna click on\nthe licensing agreement?\n\n254\n00:12:31.610 --> 00:12:33.760\nYou, as the administrator has to do it,\nso I'm gonna go ahead and agree.\n\n255\n00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:36.360\nI'll do that.\n\n256\n00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:41.230\nAnd now it's asking about configurations,\npackages, and post-install scripts.\n\n257\n00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:43.420\nI want this to be a stock install,\nI don't want to mess with it, so\n\n258\n00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:45.170\nI'm just gonna hit next.\n\n259\n00:12:45.170 --> 00:12:48.730\nAnd it's going to ask for\nme to generate a file, right?\n\n260\n00:12:48.730 --> 00:12:52.160\nYou can give it a host name for\nyour computer's.\n\n261\n00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:54.220\nWhen it deploys your computer\nits gotta have a name.\n\n262\n00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:55.150\nWe could choose to give it one.\n\n263\n00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:56.140\nI'm just going to leave it empty here.\n\n264\n00:12:56.140 --> 00:12:59.230\nIt should generate its own strings and\nI shouldn't have to mess with that.\n\n265\n00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:04.320\nAnd then if I've got directory servers\nthat I want to join these machines to.\n\n266\n00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:06.730\nI don't have one so I'll leave that be.\n\n267\n00:13:06.730 --> 00:13:09.070\nAnd then where we would\nwant to install it to.\n\n268\n00:13:09.070 --> 00:13:13.810\nOkay, I'm just going to leave that blank\ntoo and we'll go ahead and finish this up.\n\n269\n00:13:13.810 --> 00:13:20.100\nSo when I finish it up, now I've got\na net install of install OS X El Capitan.\n\n270\n00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:22.810\nI'm just going to get rid of that word\ninstall so it makes a little more sense.\n\n271\n00:13:22.810 --> 00:13:27.660\nSo this is a NetInstall of OS\n10.11.3 in this case, right?\n\n272\n00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:32.090\nSo I'm just gonna assign it and\noff we go, right?\n\n273\n00:13:32.090 --> 00:13:33.420\nSo getting that put in place,\n\n274\n00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:37.720\nwhen that's done, I guess I have to choose\nwhich computer models I want to support.\n\n275\n00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:40.080\nI'll support them all.\n\n276\n00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:42.580\nSo I'll go ahead and finish that.\n\n277\n00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:43.410\nI'm not gonna filter any.\n\n278\n00:13:43.410 --> 00:13:45.630\nWe'll talk about some of these\ncustomization options here in a minute.\n\n279\n00:13:45.630 --> 00:13:47.430\nI just want to go with most\nof this stuff as the default.\n\n280\n00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:50.500\nSo I'm going to go ahead and\nstick that right on my desktop.\n\n281\n00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:52.620\nAnd actually, you know what?\n\n282\n00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:54.400\nLet me make a new folder here.\n\n283\n00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:58.690\nI'm going to make a folder\nhere called installed images\n\n284\n00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:02.260\non my desktop and\nI'm going to park it right in there.\n\n285\n00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:03.510\nOkay, so I'm gonna do that.\n\n286\n00:14:03.510 --> 00:14:07.320\nNow you'll notice that I clicked next\non almost every one of those screens.\n\n287\n00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:09.250\nI really didn't change anything.\n\n288\n00:14:09.250 --> 00:14:13.180\nAnd so what I've created\nhere is a stock installer,\n\n289\n00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:17.530\na net install image that I can serve\nup in my network, and people can\n\n290\n00:14:17.530 --> 00:14:21.700\ninstall El Capitan on their systems\nwithout having to go to the app store,\n\n291\n00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:23.970\nwithout having to have iCloud\ncredentials when you roll it out.\n\n292\n00:14:23.970 --> 00:14:28.670\nAnd this will be a stock\ndefault install of El Capitan.\n\n293\n00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:30.670\nSo that's basically the net install image.\n\n294\n00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:36.050\nNow having a stock image is nice, but\n\n295\n00:14:36.050 --> 00:14:38.790\nhaving a customized image is better,\nright?\n\n296\n00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:41.890\nAnd we may need to tweak this, and\ncustomize it, and change it, and\n\n297\n00:14:41.890 --> 00:14:46.280\nkinda rework it to match our own\nenvironment and we can certainly do that.\n\n298\n00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:49.100\nYou guys saw a lot of those screens\nthat I just clicked next on\n\n299\n00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:51.150\nwere giving me the option\nto customize things.\n\n300\n00:14:51.150 --> 00:14:55.990\nCustomizing them based on the name\nof the computer and so on.\n\n301\n00:14:55.990 --> 00:14:59.340\nAnd a lot of those are options\nthat we will want to tweak and\n\n302\n00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:00.930\ncustomize to build it up.\n\n303\n00:15:00.930 --> 00:15:03.810\nNow what I just did was\nbuild that stock image.\n\n304\n00:15:03.810 --> 00:15:06.550\nAnd that's normally what I start out,\nI always do like to have a stock image cuz\n\n305\n00:15:06.550 --> 00:15:09.130\nif something's ever going wrong\nI can use it to troubleshoot.\n\n306\n00:15:09.130 --> 00:15:10.570\nWe build a stock image.\n\n307\n00:15:10.570 --> 00:15:15.420\nBut then we can build a customized image\nthat matches our company needs, right.\n\n308\n00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:17.960\nAnd you can really get advanced\nwith some of this stuff.\n\n309\n00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:19.500\nLet me show you what I mean.\n\n310\n00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:22.650\nI just finished this one,\nso I'll just hit done.\n\n311\n00:15:22.650 --> 00:15:23.590\nI should hit start over.\n\n312\n00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:26.690\nSo if you start over,\nit lets you create an all new image.\n\n313\n00:15:26.690 --> 00:15:28.870\nLet me just get back into\nthe system image utility.\n\n314\n00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:31.250\nAnd I'm gonna come in here and\n\n315\n00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:36.360\ncreate another image based on that\ninstall OS 10 El Capitan image.\n\n316\n00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:39.900\nAnd I'm gonna do a NetInstall image.\n\n317\n00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:43.130\nNow as I run through we saw a lot of\ncustomization options that were just part\n\n318\n00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:44.330\nof the wizard.\n\n319\n00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:46.840\nAnd as you go through it on\n\n320\n00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:50.500\nevery screen there's a little button\ndown here that says customize, right?\n\n321\n00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:53.452\nWe've got options of what is\ncustomized here in the Wizard and\n\n322\n00:15:53.452 --> 00:15:57.328\nthere's even more that are hidden inside\nof that customize button right there.\n\n323\n00:15:57.328 --> 00:16:01.458\nOkay, but let's just step through some of\nthese and kind of identify what they are.\n\n324\n00:16:01.458 --> 00:16:04.888\nThis first one Add configuration profiles,\nright?\n\n325\n00:16:04.888 --> 00:16:06.958\nSo what is a configuration profile?\n\n326\n00:16:06.958 --> 00:16:09.120\nI know I've mentioned them before.\n\n327\n00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:11.030\nWe're not gonna normally do\nconfiguration profiles here.\n\n328\n00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:14.630\nWhat they are, are rules, they're\npolicies that apply to this machine that\n\n329\n00:16:14.630 --> 00:16:16.880\nrestrict people's ability\nto change things.\n\n330\n00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:19.660\nThat force the machine to be\nconfigured a certain way, right?\n\n331\n00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:23.100\nSo when I deploy an image If I\ndeploy it on the network,\n\n332\n00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:28.030\nthat machine will be the way that I\nintended it right there on day one.\n\n333\n00:16:28.030 --> 00:16:32.800\nBut on day two, day three, day 300,\nthe end user starts messing with it.\n\n334\n00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:34.040\nThey change the wallpaper,\n\n335\n00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:37.670\nthey disable the screen saver, they do\nall the little things that end users do.\n\n336\n00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:41.360\nI can do a configuration profile\nthat forces those settings and\n\n337\n00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:43.360\ndoesn't let the end user change them.\n\n338\n00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:46.800\nThat's a profile and\nyou can do it as a part of the image but\n\n339\n00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:49.360\ntypically I usually do it as\npart of the profile manager.\n\n340\n00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:50.660\nSo we can push it over the network, right.\n\n341\n00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:52.150\nGive you that centralized manager.\n\n342\n00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:55.620\nSo we're gonna see that in a later episode\nwhen we configure the profile manager.\n\n343\n00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:59.650\nPackages, that can be\nthird party software,\n\n344\n00:16:59.650 --> 00:17:04.530\nhardware drivers, or other things that\nI want to make a part of this image.\n\n345\n00:17:04.530 --> 00:17:08.910\nI might want this image to come\nwith Virtual Box installed.\n\n346\n00:17:08.910 --> 00:17:12.720\nWell, Virtual Box has a .pkg file,\na package that I can load in and\n\n347\n00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:13.740\nthen I want to be a part of this image.\n\n348\n00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:16.170\nSo when I deploy the image, it will\nalready have Virtual Box loaded on it.\n\n349\n00:17:16.170 --> 00:17:19.080\nSo you can do that as\nanother pretty handy thing.\n\n350\n00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:20.850\nAnd post install scripts.\n\n351\n00:17:20.850 --> 00:17:23.970\nWhen the install is done,\nit can fire off a script.\n\n352\n00:17:23.970 --> 00:17:25.840\nAnd when we launch a script,\nwhat can we do?\n\n353\n00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:27.460\nWes, what can you do with the script?\n\n354\n00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:28.820\n>> Just about anything you want.\n\n355\n00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:30.360\n>> You're limited by\nyour own intelligence.\n\n356\n00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:30.919\n>> That's right.\n\n357\n00:17:30.919 --> 00:17:32.840\n>> [LAUGH] Well, let's change that.\n\n358\n00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:34.399\nYou're limited by your\nown ability to Google.\n\n359\n00:17:34.399 --> 00:17:35.940\n[LAUGH]\n>> I was gonna say, copy cut and\n\n360\n00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:37.620\npaste is your friend on scripting.\n\n361\n00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:38.530\n>> That's right.\n\n362\n00:17:38.530 --> 00:17:40.720\nSo we kind of have a limitation there but\nnot really.\n\n363\n00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:43.910\nI mean, once you're into a script,\nyou can do whatever the heck you want and\n\n364\n00:17:43.910 --> 00:17:46.400\nyou can really have some\nadvance things go on.\n\n365\n00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:49.220\nAnd so that's a great example right\nthere how we customize and so\n\n366\n00:17:49.220 --> 00:17:53.780\nwe would just hit our little plusibly\nensure to add it in those various things\n\n367\n00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:55.090\nwhatever it was that you wanted.\n\n368\n00:17:55.090 --> 00:17:58.960\nIf they were PKG files,\nif they're script files or\n\n369\n00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:02.810\nwhatever you would add those in and now\nwe have that functionality as part of it.\n\n370\n00:18:02.810 --> 00:18:07.930\nSo, I gave the example of Of Virtual Box,\nwhich I think I have downloaded.\n\n371\n00:18:07.930 --> 00:18:09.260\nLet me see if I've got\nthat one downloaded.\n\n372\n00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:11.060\nI'm pretty sure I do.\n\n373\n00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:11.900\nI usually have a copy.\n\n374\n00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:12.700\nThere we go, Virtual Box.\n\n375\n00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:14.310\nSo let me just crack this.\n\n376\n00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:19.220\nI've got a DMG for Virtual Box, but\nit installs with a package file.\n\n377\n00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:20.280\nSo I'm just gonna open that up and\n\n378\n00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:26.170\nthere should be a package file inside\nof it which we should see here shortly.\n\n379\n00:18:26.170 --> 00:18:27.170\nThere we go.\n\n380\n00:18:27.170 --> 00:18:28.970\nSo it's got this little package file,\nright.\n\n381\n00:18:28.970 --> 00:18:31.820\nI'm gonna add that package\nfile into my image.\n\n382\n00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:35.560\nSo when I go in here to\nmy system image utility.\n\n383\n00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:41.920\nI'm just gonna hit the plus sign and\nI'll browse and find that image, that pkg.\n\n384\n00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:42.920\nThere it is.\n\n385\n00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:45.700\nAnd I'll load it in now virtual box\nprobably isn't software I want all of my\n\n386\n00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:48.880\nusers to have but you guys get the idea\nthat you can use any software here.\n\n387\n00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:51.900\nAnd it can be drivers, it can be all\nsorts of stuff in that package file.\n\n388\n00:18:52.990 --> 00:18:56.130\nAll right, so now that's gonna be\npart of this image when I deploy.\n\n389\n00:18:56.130 --> 00:19:00.410\nIt's a stock install with virtual box,\nright?\n\n390\n00:19:00.410 --> 00:19:02.610\nAs I continue to move forward,\nmy host name.\n\n391\n00:19:02.610 --> 00:19:04.400\nHow do I wanna name the computer?\n\n392\n00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:08.730\nWell, you can actually build a text file\nthat contains a list of names to use for\n\n393\n00:19:08.730 --> 00:19:11.060\nthe computer, or\nit can just generate them.\n\n394\n00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:14.840\nAnd it's gonna generate them automatically\nwith a little random string or\n\n395\n00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:16.880\nyou can add like a prefix to it.\n\n396\n00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:21.230\nSo if this image is gonna be used at one\nlocation, maybe at my Orlando office.\n\n397\n00:19:21.230 --> 00:19:26.040\nI might want every branch to start with\nORL, so I know it's an Orlando machine and\n\n398\n00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:28.520\nthen proceeded by a random string.\n\n399\n00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:31.300\nSo you can start to\ncustomize the computer name.\n\n400\n00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:34.560\nAnd you can even say let the host pick,\nright?\n\n401\n00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:37.680\nI can do it by host preference,\nmatch to client after install.\n\n402\n00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:40.420\nSo when it installs and then they can look\nat whatever the name was on the system\n\n403\n00:19:40.420 --> 00:19:41.810\nprior to that and match it.\n\n404\n00:19:41.810 --> 00:19:44.430\nThere's a few different options on\nhow we want to name those machines.\n\n405\n00:19:46.250 --> 00:19:47.860\nIf we wanna map to a directory server.\n\n406\n00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:51.360\nIf you've got an open directory server\nwhich we'll see more in the Mac\n\n407\n00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:55.310\nintegration basic show and in the server\nshows than we will here in this one.\n\n408\n00:19:55.310 --> 00:19:59.320\nBut if you've got a directory server for\nuser accounts you can pre-define it\n\n409\n00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:02.360\nhere and that way when the VM comes\nup it'll automatically connect to it.\n\n410\n00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:06.230\nAll you have to do is put the server and\nthe identifier and the username and\n\n411\n00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:07.250\npassword to connect to it.\n\n412\n00:20:07.250 --> 00:20:08.710\nRight?\nSo that you can establish that initial\n\n413\n00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:11.830\nconnection and from then on it'll\nbe able to work with the system.\n\n414\n00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:15.639\nAll right,\na few other things we can tweak.\n\n415\n00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:19.190\nAutomatically install to,\nthis is a really important setting.\n\n416\n00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:24.060\nOf all the customization options,\nthey're fully optional.\n\n417\n00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:28.000\nRemember the first image that I built,\nI just hit Next 20 times and that was it.\n\n418\n00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:29.750\nEverything was optional.\n\n419\n00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:32.790\nBut the image that I created is\ngonna require user interaction.\n\n420\n00:20:32.790 --> 00:20:36.040\nThe user is going to have to answer\na few questions during that install\n\n421\n00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:38.060\ncuz I did I a stock install.\n\n422\n00:20:38.060 --> 00:20:41.760\nBut if I want it to be\ncompletely automated,\n\n423\n00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:43.450\nthis is the one option I have to do.\n\n424\n00:20:43.450 --> 00:20:47.900\nI have to tell it where to install to,\nI have to tell it the hard drive.\n\n425\n00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:51.350\nIf I give it this option,\nI've already signed the license agreement,\n\n426\n00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:54.160\nnow the whole install can happen\nwith no user interaction,\n\n427\n00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:55.750\nthey just see the install happen and\nthat's it.\n\n428\n00:20:55.750 --> 00:20:57.250\nThey don't have to provide any data and\n\n429\n00:20:57.250 --> 00:20:59.210\nthat's great if you don't\nwanna deal with your end user.\n\n430\n00:20:59.210 --> 00:21:01.120\nRight, if you don't want\nto do those support calls.\n\n431\n00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:02.270\nSo I've got to do this and\n\n432\n00:21:02.270 --> 00:21:06.190\nyou can specify a target volume,\nyou can specify it by name, right?\n\n433\n00:21:06.190 --> 00:21:08.490\nThose Macs have Macintosh HD.\n\n434\n00:21:08.490 --> 00:21:11.710\nSo we're gonna install to that and\nerase the volume before installing.\n\n435\n00:21:11.710 --> 00:21:15.990\nNow this can get broken if there\nisn't a Macintosh HD, right?\n\n436\n00:21:15.990 --> 00:21:18.923\nIf the system is been repartitioned or\nmodified, but\n\n437\n00:21:18.923 --> 00:21:21.020\nmost of them already are set the same.\n\n438\n00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:23.019\nAnd so we can automatically install it.\n\n439\n00:21:23.019 --> 00:21:26.747\nAnd if we do this, now the user\nwon't be prompted for anything.\n\n440\n00:21:26.747 --> 00:21:28.628\nSo this is really one of the most\nimportant customization options.\n\n441\n00:21:31.478 --> 00:21:34.428\nAll right and that's really the last\ncustomization option we get right\n\n442\n00:21:34.428 --> 00:21:36.408\nup to here where I can\ntell what we're gonna do.\n\n443\n00:21:36.408 --> 00:21:43.755\nI'm going to call this a NetInstall of\nCustomized OS X El Capitan, like that and\n\n444\n00:21:43.755 --> 00:21:49.940\nso I'm gonna be doing a customized\ninstallation on this one.\n\n445\n00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:53.020\nAnd down here, it's got where it's\ngonna assign a random index or\n\n446\n00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:56.140\nI could give it a specific image name,\nimage number and\n\n447\n00:21:56.140 --> 00:21:59.010\nwhether it's gonna be serve\nfrom multiple servers.\n\n448\n00:21:59.010 --> 00:22:01.600\nThis is kind of important\nbecause If I have\n\n449\n00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:05.300\noffices all over the world I might want\nthis image stored on more than one\n\n450\n00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:07.620\nserver to get it geographically\nclose to people.\n\n451\n00:22:07.620 --> 00:22:08.790\nAnd so I'm gonna tell it,\nI'm gonna say yeah,\n\n452\n00:22:08.790 --> 00:22:12.670\nI'm gonna store this on more than\none server that's out there.\n\n453\n00:22:13.730 --> 00:22:17.700\nNow when I do that I've gotta have\nan index number assigned to it, right?\n\n454\n00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:21.070\nAnd so it's got right down here where it's\ngonna assign a random image index number.\n\n455\n00:22:21.070 --> 00:22:24.880\nOr I can tell it one specifically and\nI can say hey, I'm gonna store this,\n\n456\n00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:26.400\nthis is gonna be image number one.\n\n457\n00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:27.550\nOr it's gonna be image number ten.\n\n458\n00:22:27.550 --> 00:22:30.710\nAnd so I can put that so\nI can start to tell my images apart.\n\n459\n00:22:30.710 --> 00:22:33.660\n>> Don on that index number,\nis that a, you know where\n\n460\n00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:36.490\nplaying darts here blindfolded,\nwe're throwing the dart at the board,\n\n461\n00:22:36.490 --> 00:22:39.050\nwhatever number it hits,\nthat's the number we're gonna have.\n\n462\n00:22:39.050 --> 00:22:41.280\nIs it random or\nis there a significance behind it.\n\n463\n00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:42.940\nThere actually is a significance.\n\n464\n00:22:42.940 --> 00:22:44.750\nIt's somewhat random.\n\n465\n00:22:44.750 --> 00:22:48.390\nNotice here it's giving me a choice,\n1-65535, but\n\n466\n00:22:48.390 --> 00:22:54.150\nif you float your mouse over it,\ndid you see that popup?\n\n467\n00:22:54.150 --> 00:22:57.000\nThere it goes,\n1 through 4095 are standalone,\n\n468\n00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:01.200\n4096 all the way through\n65535 are load-balanced.\n\n469\n00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:02.590\nAnd what does that mean?\n\n470\n00:23:02.590 --> 00:23:07.434\nWell, if you give it an index\nnumber of one through 4,095\n\n471\n00:23:07.434 --> 00:23:12.520\nthat means that this image exists on one,\nand only one, server, right?\n\n472\n00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:13.820\nIt's not present anywhere else.\n\n473\n00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:15.430\nThere's only one copy of this image and\n\n474\n00:23:15.430 --> 00:23:17.650\nthis is where you have to get it from,\nright?\n\n475\n00:23:17.650 --> 00:23:20.070\nSo regardless of where my\nclient is in the world,\n\n476\n00:23:20.070 --> 00:23:21.950\nthere's only one place\nhe can get that image.\n\n477\n00:23:21.950 --> 00:23:26.320\nIf I have two images with\nthe same index number,\n\n478\n00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:30.930\nbeneath 4,095,\nit's gonna treat those as different and\n\n479\n00:23:30.930 --> 00:23:33.320\nyour server will only be able to\nserve up one or the other, right.\n\n480\n00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:36.450\nYou can't have two with the same\nindex number below that number.\n\n481\n00:23:36.450 --> 00:23:39.325\nBut if it's higher, if it's 4,096 or\n\n482\n00:23:39.325 --> 00:23:42.160\nhigher, Then it's a little different,\nright?\n\n483\n00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:46.620\nNow it's a matter of, I could have this\nsame image stored on more than one server.\n\n484\n00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:49.800\nWhen my client boots up, it can just\ngrab the first server that it finds.\n\n485\n00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:52.530\nThe one that's fastest,\nthe one that's closest to it, right?\n\n486\n00:23:52.530 --> 00:23:55.438\nSo I need to make sure when I build my\nimages that I don't duplicate numbers.\n\n487\n00:23:55.438 --> 00:23:57.104\nBut I also need to anticipate whether or\n\n488\n00:23:57.104 --> 00:23:59.688\nnot these are going to be served\nup from more than one system.\n\n489\n00:23:59.688 --> 00:24:02.999\nSo if you use the top here where it says,\nassign a random index number,\n\n490\n00:24:02.999 --> 00:24:04.418\nit does pick a random number.\n\n491\n00:24:04.418 --> 00:24:08.860\nIf you check this box,\nit'll be a random number higher than 4096.\n\n492\n00:24:08.860 --> 00:24:12.200\nIf you don't check this box it'll\nbe a random number below 4095,\n\n493\n00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:16.610\nor, I guess, below or\nequal to 4095, there we go.\n\n494\n00:24:16.610 --> 00:24:19.190\nSo, that's really what\nthis option is doing.\n\n495\n00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:21.660\nI usually assign a specific index.\n\n496\n00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:23.485\nThat way, I don't worry about duplicates,\n\n497\n00:24:23.485 --> 00:24:25.860\ncuz it can randomly\ngenerate the same number.\n\n498\n00:24:25.860 --> 00:24:26.730\nAnd so I might do it this way.\n\n499\n00:24:26.730 --> 00:24:28.760\nI'm going to serve this one\nup from more than one system.\n\n500\n00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:31.760\nSo I'm going to give it 5000, right?\n\n501\n00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:33.980\n5000 is a nice big number\nto pick that's above 4096.\n\n502\n00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:36.939\nAnd now I can serve it\non more than one system.\n\n503\n00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:40.900\nAll right, the last thing I wanna\ndo before I finish this up is,\n\n504\n00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:43.780\nI wanna hit that customize button to\nshow you guys something really neat.\n\n505\n00:24:43.780 --> 00:24:45.630\nThe customization options\nthat I've been doing so\n\n506\n00:24:45.630 --> 00:24:47.340\nfar were just built into the Wizard.\n\n507\n00:24:47.340 --> 00:24:51.400\nBut when you hit the customize button,\nnotice what it launches.\n\n508\n00:24:52.530 --> 00:24:57.200\nIt launches this crazy workflow,\nthis very complex interface.\n\n509\n00:24:57.200 --> 00:25:02.110\nAnd it should look familiar to you\nbecause It's the automator, right?\n\n510\n00:25:02.110 --> 00:25:06.280\nThe automator, the same system we use\nto automate simple tasks on our Mac,\n\n511\n00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:08.560\nyou can use to automate these images.\n\n512\n00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:11.700\nAnd now, sky's the limits as\nfar as what we wanna do, right?\n\n513\n00:25:11.700 --> 00:25:14.630\nWe can deploy a stock install if we want,\nor\n\n514\n00:25:14.630 --> 00:25:17.650\nwe can jump in there and\nreally customize things.\n\n515\n00:25:17.650 --> 00:25:21.390\nAnd by using this, if we look over\nhere on the right side at my workflow\n\n516\n00:25:21.390 --> 00:25:23.470\nlook at how the workflow is structured.\n\n517\n00:25:23.470 --> 00:25:27.390\nI've got define image source and\nlet's say I hadn't messed with this.\n\n518\n00:25:27.390 --> 00:25:31.340\nIf this was a stock install it would\nstart with define image source and\n\n519\n00:25:31.340 --> 00:25:37.970\nthen way down at the bottom,\nit would have, what's the last one?\n\n520\n00:25:37.970 --> 00:25:40.510\nShoot, or\nactually I think that's all it would have.\n\n521\n00:25:40.510 --> 00:25:42.660\nIf I did a stock and so\nI think that is all it would have.\n\n522\n00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:46.370\nIt might have the perform installation or\nsomething like that as the last option.\n\n523\n00:25:46.370 --> 00:25:47.590\nBut since I customized things,\n\n524\n00:25:47.590 --> 00:25:49.960\nyou'll see there's more stuff\ninjected in this work flow.\n\n525\n00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:53.610\nFor example, I've got define image source,\n\n526\n00:25:53.610 --> 00:25:56.480\nand then next, add packages and\npost-install scripts.\n\n527\n00:25:56.480 --> 00:25:58.660\nThere's that VirtualBox\npackage that I added.\n\n528\n00:25:58.660 --> 00:26:00.710\nRight, I did that as part of the wizard.\n\n529\n00:26:00.710 --> 00:26:04.490\nAnd then if I keep scrolling down,\nI've got add configuration profiles.\n\n530\n00:26:04.490 --> 00:26:08.830\nI didn't add any, but I could continue\nto add more right here if I wanted.\n\n531\n00:26:08.830 --> 00:26:10.770\nApply system configuration settings,\nright,\n\n532\n00:26:10.770 --> 00:26:14.960\nhere's where it connects to a directory\nserver or assigns a computer name, right?\n\n533\n00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:17.890\nGenerate a unique computer name,\nthat's what I chose.\n\n534\n00:26:17.890 --> 00:26:21.240\nAnd then lastly, that real important\noption, enable automated install.\n\n535\n00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:22.780\nThat way the users don't see options.\n\n536\n00:26:22.780 --> 00:26:27.560\nSo each of these have been laid out but I\ncan come in and add even more stuff to it.\n\n537\n00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:28.950\nIt's just the automator and\n\n538\n00:26:28.950 --> 00:26:33.850\nthe automator is packed full of actions,\npacked full of stuff.\n\n539\n00:26:33.850 --> 00:26:37.560\nBut I can throw in there,\nfrom adding PDF's and albums,\n\n540\n00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:42.550\nto formatting hard drives, partitioning\ndisks, creating user accounts, right?\n\n541\n00:26:42.550 --> 00:26:44.280\nThere's a ton of stuff in here.\n\n542\n00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:46.580\nIf I go into most used,\nyou'll see a couple of examples.\n\n543\n00:26:46.580 --> 00:26:50.170\nBut the most used stuff is usually the\nthings that are already in there, right?\n\n544\n00:26:50.170 --> 00:26:52.550\nSystem configuration,\npackage, and post install.\n\n545\n00:26:52.550 --> 00:26:54.330\nThat's stuff that we've\nalready got in there.\n\n546\n00:26:54.330 --> 00:26:55.990\nSo that's not too helpful.\n\n547\n00:26:55.990 --> 00:26:57.830\nBut if I jump into like utilities or\n\n548\n00:26:57.830 --> 00:27:02.270\nsystem that's where we can really\nstart to see some interesting things.\n\n549\n00:27:02.270 --> 00:27:05.390\nYou know,\nfrom setting my desktop picture, right?\n\n550\n00:27:05.390 --> 00:27:06.590\nAnd you set the wallpaper.\n\n551\n00:27:06.590 --> 00:27:09.750\nAnd now I can have my company logo\non the wallpaper fore this image.\n\n552\n00:27:09.750 --> 00:27:12.150\nIt's customizing this default install.\n\n553\n00:27:12.150 --> 00:27:13.620\nYou can set all sorts of things.\n\n554\n00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:16.030\nSleep and wake timers, right?\n\n555\n00:27:16.030 --> 00:27:18.990\nLet's say I wanna do my sleep and\nwake timers, right?\n\n556\n00:27:18.990 --> 00:27:23.600\nSo I know that my company\nis open from 9 to 5 and\n\n557\n00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:27.760\novernight the computer sit there idle from\n5 pm to 9 am just eating up electricity.\n\n558\n00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:29.360\nSo I want them to go to sleep.\n\n559\n00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:33.540\nSo I can add this into my automator,\nright?\n\n560\n00:27:33.540 --> 00:27:37.280\nNow be careful when you add these,\nbecause the order is important.\n\n561\n00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:40.740\nThe very first step has to\nbe define image source.\n\n562\n00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:43.520\nIf it's anything else,\nthe image breaks, it doesn't work.\n\n563\n00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:49.310\nOkay and the very last step has to\neither be enable automated install or\n\n564\n00:27:49.310 --> 00:27:52.190\nperform installation, that default one\nthat's gone on mine because I chose\n\n565\n00:27:52.190 --> 00:27:53.180\nthe automated install, right.\n\n566\n00:27:53.180 --> 00:27:54.880\nSo that has to be the last one.\n\n567\n00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:56.810\nAnything we add has to go in-between.\n\n568\n00:27:56.810 --> 00:28:01.310\nIf you added before or after the steps\nthat already exist it breaks the image and\n\n569\n00:28:01.310 --> 00:28:02.090\nthe image doesn't work.\n\n570\n00:28:02.090 --> 00:28:03.650\nSo you got to add it in between.\n\n571\n00:28:03.650 --> 00:28:07.850\nSo I can take some like set sleep and\nwake and we can just drag that and\n\n572\n00:28:07.850 --> 00:28:09.210\nI'll drop it in here.\n\n573\n00:28:09.210 --> 00:28:14.960\nAnd I usually like to put it towards\nthe end because what's it gonna do is.\n\n574\n00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:20.110\nZooming like crazy here today Is going\nto apply system configuration settings.\n\n575\n00:28:20.110 --> 00:28:22.520\nAnd those might be things that\nI choose to push out later.\n\n576\n00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:26.790\nAnd only when that's done is it then going\nto come and do set, sleep, and wake.\n\n577\n00:28:26.790 --> 00:28:30.200\nThese will override the system\nconfiguration settings in the last step.\n\n578\n00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:31.450\nIf I put it the other way around,\n\n579\n00:28:31.450 --> 00:28:33.460\nthe system configuration\nsettings could override this.\n\n580\n00:28:33.460 --> 00:28:35.620\nSo you have to choose that priority.\n\n581\n00:28:35.620 --> 00:28:38.660\nBut now I can come in, I can say I\nwanna put this computer to sleep,\n\n582\n00:28:38.660 --> 00:28:42.370\nif it's been sitting for\none hour inactive, let it go to sleep.\n\n583\n00:28:42.370 --> 00:28:46.370\nSo 5 PM happens, people leave, it's 6 PM,\nall the machines go to sleep, and\n\n584\n00:28:46.370 --> 00:28:49.530\nthen all night long, they're asleep\nuntil people come in and wake them up.\n\n585\n00:28:49.530 --> 00:28:53.550\nWe can make the display go\ninactive much faster, 15 minutes.\n\n586\n00:28:53.550 --> 00:28:56.720\nHard disks, we'll make the hard disk\ngo to sleep at 30 minutes, right?\n\n587\n00:28:56.720 --> 00:28:59.260\nI can put these in, get them set up.\n\n588\n00:28:59.260 --> 00:29:01.990\nAnd then maybe there's days when I\nwanna do network administration, so\n\n589\n00:29:01.990 --> 00:29:04.420\nI might choose to wake\nover ethernet access.\n\n590\n00:29:04.420 --> 00:29:06.580\nSo if I start sending signals\nto them they'll wake up.\n\n591\n00:29:06.580 --> 00:29:10.000\nWe'll set them to restart automatically\nif there's a power failure,\n\n592\n00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:15.290\nand I don't know if we want the power\nbutton to sleep, I'll just leave that be.\n\n593\n00:29:15.290 --> 00:29:19.120\nSo I can customize these options and\nthat's now part of my image.\n\n594\n00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:22.430\nAnything you can do in the automator\ncan be baked into your imaging and\n\n595\n00:29:22.430 --> 00:29:23.960\nreally create something cool and custom.\n\n596\n00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:28.790\n>> Now Don, I would assume you can add\nadditional task because every option you\n\n597\n00:29:28.790 --> 00:29:32.840\ngrab from the automator and bring it\nover to the right hand panel there.\n\n598\n00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:38.960\nIs it safe to say that add a task,\na sequential task within the work flow.\n\n599\n00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:40.210\n>> Yes, that's what you're doing.\n\n600\n00:29:40.210 --> 00:29:42.650\nYou're adding these tasks and\nsome of them get combined together, but\n\n601\n00:29:42.650 --> 00:29:44.570\nmost of them are separate little entities.\n\n602\n00:29:44.570 --> 00:29:45.990\nAnd you can make this as big as you want.\n\n603\n00:29:45.990 --> 00:29:47.440\nYou can go super crazy with it and\n\n604\n00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:51.750\nget it mega complex, or\nyou can kinda keep it all rolled together.\n\n605\n00:29:51.750 --> 00:29:54.920\nNow where that creates a challenge\nis if I'm trying to create\n\n606\n00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:58.580\none universal image for my entire company,\n\n607\n00:29:58.580 --> 00:30:03.390\nwell it's hard to get one thing set\nup exactly the way you want it.\n\n608\n00:30:03.390 --> 00:30:08.680\nImagine if you had one department\nwhere the users had scripts\n\n609\n00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:13.470\nthat ran at night and we just made their\ncomputers go to sleep at night and so\n\n610\n00:30:13.470 --> 00:30:15.890\nthey come in the morning and their scripts\ndidn't run and they're all mad and\n\n611\n00:30:15.890 --> 00:30:18.900\nangry like hey I left this running last\nnight and the computer went to sleep and\n\n612\n00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:20.860\nwe need to stop that.\n\n613\n00:30:20.860 --> 00:30:24.520\nThere's times when one universal image\nis just not going to be enough and so\n\n614\n00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:28.130\nI can get really complex here,\nbut the more complex I get,\n\n615\n00:30:28.130 --> 00:30:32.070\nthe less generic my image becomes and\nI start to run into problems there.\n\n616\n00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:38.720\nNow, I could start to create\na bunch of separate images, right.\n\n617\n00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:42.720\nOkay, let's say, for example,\nthat I've got teachers and students.\n\n618\n00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:48.790\nThey might have very different needs, or\nI might have accounts and salespeople.\n\n619\n00:30:48.790 --> 00:30:49.720\n>> Salespeople, yeah.\n\n620\n00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:53.780\n>> And they've got different needs,\nso I might want different images for\n\n621\n00:30:53.780 --> 00:30:55.270\nthem but\nI don't want to build from scratch.\n\n622\n00:30:55.270 --> 00:30:57.270\nI don't want to rebuild all this stuff.\n\n623\n00:30:57.270 --> 00:31:01.660\nSo what you can do is you can take\none image and you can copy it.\n\n624\n00:31:01.660 --> 00:31:03.800\nAnd then you can make packages, right?\n\n625\n00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:06.880\nPackages that contain just\nthe stuff that they want.\n\n626\n00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:08.440\nLet me say this real quick,\nand get out of it.\n\n627\n00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:13.110\nI'm gonna just, we've kinda got this\none set the way that we want it.\n\n628\n00:31:13.110 --> 00:31:17.420\nSo that should be good enough on that one,\nso I'm just gonna get out of it.\n\n629\n00:31:17.420 --> 00:31:21.020\n>> So Don, with the packages,\nnow that gives me the ability that if I\n\n630\n00:31:21.020 --> 00:31:23.990\ndo have an image that has\nspecific settings in,\n\n631\n00:31:23.990 --> 00:31:27.430\nmaybe your accounting group versus\nyour sales group that you can set\n\n632\n00:31:27.430 --> 00:31:31.120\ncustomizations to each image to\nmatch whatever the demographic or\n\n633\n00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:35.230\nthe role is within the company and you\ndon't have to maintain one gigantically,\n\n634\n00:31:35.230 --> 00:31:39.810\nmassive individual image, that might have\n70% of the stuff you don't even need,\n\n635\n00:31:39.810 --> 00:31:41.260\nbased on whatever that department is.\n\n636\n00:31:41.260 --> 00:31:42.500\n>> Yeah, that's exactly it.\n\n637\n00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:45.940\nAnd the place I see it the most\ncommonly used is with software.\n\n638\n00:31:45.940 --> 00:31:50.400\nMy accountants might need certain\nsoftware that my sales people don't.\n\n639\n00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:51.938\nAnd I don't want to pay licensing.\n\n640\n00:31:51.938 --> 00:31:54.856\nI don't want to buy a thousand copies\nof that software when I only have 20\n\n641\n00:31:54.856 --> 00:31:55.858\nemployees that need it.\n\n642\n00:31:55.858 --> 00:31:59.759\nSo instead of baking into one image\nI might have one base image But\n\n643\n00:31:59.759 --> 00:32:02.008\nthen use packages for the software.\n\n644\n00:32:02.008 --> 00:32:05.620\nI show that with like virtual box, right,\nI threw it in as a package for this image.\n\n645\n00:32:05.620 --> 00:32:08.660\nWell I might not have it,\nas a package for other images.\n\n646\n00:32:08.660 --> 00:32:11.030\nOr have it as some kind of an option.\n\n647\n00:32:11.030 --> 00:32:13.810\nAnd, if you ever need to\nmake your own package,\n\n648\n00:32:13.810 --> 00:32:18.100\nmake a package that just contains certain\nsettings, it's actually not hard to do.\n\n649\n00:32:18.100 --> 00:32:21.940\nThe system image utility, when I fired it\nup at the very beginning, it asked me for\n\n650\n00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:22.980\na source.\n\n651\n00:32:22.980 --> 00:32:24.700\nAnd for the source, what did I choose?\n\n652\n00:32:24.700 --> 00:32:30.150\nI chose the El Capitan installer, but\nit also had the option to create a package\n\n653\n00:32:30.150 --> 00:32:34.360\nwith no source, and that's where\nyou can make your own package.\n\n654\n00:32:34.360 --> 00:32:37.130\nAnd so as soon as this thing\nis done creating that image,\n\n655\n00:32:37.130 --> 00:32:38.190\nI'll show you that real quick.\n\n656\n00:32:38.190 --> 00:32:41.790\nBut basically, we just run the system\nimage utility, and you choose a no source,\n\n657\n00:32:41.790 --> 00:32:46.670\na package and then you can build it with\nfiles or settings or whatever that's\n\n658\n00:32:46.670 --> 00:32:50.460\na part of that package, and you can\ndeploy just that package out to machine.\n\n659\n00:32:50.460 --> 00:32:53.450\nSo you might deploy the base\nimage to everyone and\n\n660\n00:32:53.450 --> 00:32:57.050\nthen you deploy the accounting package to\nthe accounting department and the sales\n\n661\n00:32:57.050 --> 00:33:00.520\npackage to the sales department and now\nyou've got what's called a modular image.\n\n662\n00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:04.010\nYou've got the base image that's\ncommon for everybody and the modules,\n\n663\n00:33:04.010 --> 00:33:06.150\nthe packages that we\ndeploy to everybody else.\n\n664\n00:33:06.150 --> 00:33:07.510\nAll right, it just finished.\n\n665\n00:33:07.510 --> 00:33:08.590\nI'm gonna hit start over.\n\n666\n00:33:08.590 --> 00:33:12.820\nAnd when I started over, here's that\nscreen where I picked my, OS 10 El Capitan\n\n667\n00:33:12.820 --> 00:33:18.800\nsource, but if I choose package only,\nno install, no, OS installation.\n\n668\n00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:22.750\nWhen I hit next on that, now it just\ntakes me straight to my packages.\n\n669\n00:33:22.750 --> 00:33:24.160\nAnd I can add in virtual box,\n\n670\n00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:26.890\nI can add in the other resources\nthat I want to be a part of this.\n\n671\n00:33:26.890 --> 00:33:28.460\nIf I have other packages I\ncan throw them in there.\n\n672\n00:33:28.460 --> 00:33:31.870\nOther scripts, other files,\nwhatever it is that I want to put in here.\n\n673\n00:33:31.870 --> 00:33:36.280\nAnd I've got customize, so I can do\nautomator steps and really get complex.\n\n674\n00:33:36.280 --> 00:33:38.120\nAgain, whatever it is I want in this.\n\n675\n00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:40.600\nAnd then the big difference\nis that when I'm done,\n\n676\n00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:44.320\nthis is going to be a much more\nstreamlined system, right?\n\n677\n00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:47.860\nJust a package to roll out to machines\nthat already have the operating systems,\n\n678\n00:33:47.860 --> 00:33:49.560\nthat already have the general image.\n\n679\n00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:51.940\nAnd so I'll just run this and in fact,\nI might not want to generate a name.\n\n680\n00:33:51.940 --> 00:33:54.430\nI may just match the name of\nthe machine's already got,\n\n681\n00:33:54.430 --> 00:33:57.700\nbecause this is a package\nthe machine's already been named.\n\n682\n00:33:57.700 --> 00:34:00.920\nAnd you know so\nwe've got what we can customize here.\n\n683\n00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:03.900\nI do need to be a little careful here\nbecause if I'm rolling out a package,\n\n684\n00:34:03.900 --> 00:34:07.830\nerase target volume before install is\nprobably not something that I want.\n\n685\n00:34:07.830 --> 00:34:11.710\nAnd in fact, I might not even want to\nautomate this at all because I do need to\n\n686\n00:34:11.710 --> 00:34:14.330\ndeploy the package out, and it's going\nto carry that software along with it.\n\n687\n00:34:14.330 --> 00:34:16.860\nSo I might not want to choose that, and\n\n688\n00:34:16.860 --> 00:34:23.120\nthen when I'm done I can say this is\na NetInstall of VirtualBox, right?\n\n689\n00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:26.680\nBecause that's all that I've got\non this is just VirtualBox and\n\n690\n00:34:26.680 --> 00:34:31.310\nI can give it a image number, I'll make\nthis 5001, and I'll finish this one up.\n\n691\n00:34:31.310 --> 00:34:33.530\nIt's viable on any hardware,\nas far as I know.\n\n692\n00:34:33.530 --> 00:34:36.880\nAnd I don't want to\nfilter my MAC addresses.\n\n693\n00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:37.590\nAnd so here it is.\n\n694\n00:34:37.590 --> 00:34:38.480\nWe're gonna go ahead and create that.\n\n695\n00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:41.580\nI'll stick it in the same folder as\nthe other guys, and we'll save that.\n\n696\n00:34:41.580 --> 00:34:43.230\nSo now I've got a package.\n\n697\n00:34:43.230 --> 00:34:45.380\nI can roll out my base image and\nthen I can turn right around and\n\n698\n00:34:45.380 --> 00:34:48.080\nI can roll this one out and\nnow these people get VirtualBox.\n\n699\n00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:50.350\nAnd I can pick and choose, so\nvery cool functionality there and\n\n700\n00:34:50.350 --> 00:34:52.840\nit does make streamlizing\nadministration a lot easier.\n\n701\n00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:56.160\n>> Now there's a lot of options in there,\nif you've looked at him scrolling through\n\n702\n00:34:56.160 --> 00:34:58.390\nautomator, a lot of different\nthings that you can set.\n\n703\n00:34:58.390 --> 00:35:00.440\nAnd I know, Don, I'm not a developer, so\n\n704\n00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:03.420\ndo we have a way that can make\nthis a little bit easier?\n\n705\n00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:07.340\nMaybe even simply the process for me in\nhelping make some of those decisions?\n\n706\n00:35:07.340 --> 00:35:10.080\nCuz it looks like it can\nkinda become overwhelming.\n\n707\n00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:12.740\n>> It certainly is, and\nthere are options that are out there.\n\n708\n00:35:12.740 --> 00:35:14.380\nApple, it's part of the exam objectives.\n\n709\n00:35:14.380 --> 00:35:16.350\nThey want you to be aware that\nthere are third party solutions.\n\n710\n00:35:16.350 --> 00:35:18.900\nSo if you're not a big script writer,\ndon't worry,\n\n711\n00:35:18.900 --> 00:35:20.610\nthere's ways to make it easier.\n\n712\n00:35:20.610 --> 00:35:25.990\nSo I've got a few examples here on my\ncomputer, like JAMF, or J-A-M-F Software.\n\n713\n00:35:25.990 --> 00:35:29.300\nThey have have a product called\nComposer and what Composer does,\n\n714\n00:35:29.300 --> 00:35:32.320\nit's part of a bigger suite,\nthe Casper suite and\n\n715\n00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:36.460\nit lets you build automations and\nworkflows and stuff that do all sorts of\n\n716\n00:35:36.460 --> 00:35:40.840\namazing things that can then be baked into\nand then installed in deployment images.\n\n717\n00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:44.470\nSo you can build deployment images\nusing something like composer and\n\n718\n00:35:44.470 --> 00:35:46.210\nit really does make life a lot easier.\n\n719\n00:35:46.210 --> 00:35:49.360\nIt's not necessarily great for\noperating system images,\n\n720\n00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:52.260\ncuz you just use the El Capitan installer.\n\n721\n00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:55.040\nBut for building software packages and\nautomation packages,\n\n722\n00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:58.240\nit does an amazing job, and\nyou don't have to know coding.\n\n723\n00:35:58.240 --> 00:35:59.410\nYou don't have to know scripting.\n\n724\n00:35:59.410 --> 00:36:00.730\nIt can do it for you.\n\n725\n00:36:00.730 --> 00:36:02.730\nAnother product that's out\nthere is from absolute.\n\n726\n00:36:02.730 --> 00:36:06.810\nThere's InstallEase, which,\nam I on on the right page?\n\n727\n00:36:06.810 --> 00:36:09.440\nWell anyhow, it's InstallEase\nis their product and they,\n\n728\n00:36:09.440 --> 00:36:11.430\nthey might have renamed it on me.\n\n729\n00:36:11.430 --> 00:36:12.600\nBut they do the same thing, right.\n\n730\n00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:14.670\nThey make it where it's easy to deploy and\n\n731\n00:36:14.670 --> 00:36:16.860\nbuild these images without\nhaving to write code.\n\n732\n00:36:16.860 --> 00:36:19.020\nYou certainly can write the scripts and\n\n733\n00:36:19.020 --> 00:36:22.720\ncode if you want, but\nInstallEase is their product.\n\n734\n00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:25.690\nAnd then there's even free ones,\nthe first two I showed you are pay.\n\n735\n00:36:25.690 --> 00:36:29.540\nThere's a free package called Iceburg,\nand I know a lot of people that use this.\n\n736\n00:36:29.540 --> 00:36:32.560\nAnd if you look at Iceburg it's\nvery similar to the automator.\n\n737\n00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:35.520\nThat you can start to build up packages\nwith the software and the settings that\n\n738\n00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:39.570\nyou want and it'll create that PKG\nfile that you can then distribute and\n\n739\n00:36:39.570 --> 00:36:40.910\nit'll automatically deploy and\n\n740\n00:36:40.910 --> 00:36:44.560\ninstall software without having to be\na super crazy expert on this stuff.\n\n741\n00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:46.290\nIt's free which is kind of nice, but\n\n742\n00:36:46.290 --> 00:36:48.700\nit also means it's not as feature\nrich as some of the other ones.\n\n743\n00:36:48.700 --> 00:36:51.120\nSo just be aware there's third party\nsoftware out there that can help.\n\n744\n00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:52.260\n>> A lot of good information.\n\n745\n00:36:52.260 --> 00:36:53.870\nWe talked about net install and\n\n746\n00:36:53.870 --> 00:36:56.880\nsome of the things that you\ncan do by adding packages and\n\n747\n00:36:56.880 --> 00:36:59.730\nsome of the customization that you can do\nto the image because remember not every\n\n748\n00:36:59.730 --> 00:37:02.740\nimage is going to be one size fits all and\nget different departments done.\n\n749\n00:37:02.740 --> 00:37:03.875\nGreat information.\n\n750\n00:37:03.875 --> 00:37:05.865\nGot anything else for us in this one?\n\n751\n00:37:05.865 --> 00:37:08.475\n>> I touch very lightly on\nconfiguration profiles.\n\n752\n00:37:08.475 --> 00:37:09.995\nRemember, we will see those again.\n\n753\n00:37:09.995 --> 00:37:13.255\nWe'll have at least one episode, probably\nmore than one, on the profile manager.\n\n754\n00:37:13.255 --> 00:37:14.495\nAnd so\nthat's where we're gonna tackle those.\n\n755\n00:37:14.495 --> 00:37:16.212\nSo don't think I'm skipping over it.\n\n756\n00:37:16.212 --> 00:37:19.162\nAnd then the other thing is, because\nthis will probably be an exam question,\n\n757\n00:37:19.162 --> 00:37:22.892\nremember how important it is to\nchoose the installation destination,\n\n758\n00:37:22.892 --> 00:37:24.492\nthe hard drive you're going to install to.\n\n759\n00:37:24.492 --> 00:37:27.462\nIf you don't choose that option,\nthe end user will see choices.\n\n760\n00:37:27.462 --> 00:37:29.300\nThey will have a wizard\nthey have to complete.\n\n761\n00:37:29.300 --> 00:37:32.920\nIf we tell it what hard drive to install\nto, it can be a fully automated install.\n\n762\n00:37:32.920 --> 00:37:34.670\nThe end user just sees it happen.\n\n763\n00:37:34.670 --> 00:37:36.190\nThey don't have to check anything.\n\n764\n00:37:36.190 --> 00:37:37.620\nIt's much more streamlined.\n\n765\n00:37:37.620 --> 00:37:38.330\n>> All right, Don.\n\n766\n00:37:38.330 --> 00:37:39.750\nThat's a wealth of good information.\n\n767\n00:37:39.750 --> 00:37:40.560\nBut it does look like,\n\n768\n00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:43.590\nwe've come to the end of another\nexciting episode here at ITProTV.\n\n769\n00:37:43.590 --> 00:37:44.870\nSo we're gonna go ahead and sign out.\n\n770\n00:37:44.870 --> 00:37:46.150\nAnd I've been your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n771\n00:37:46.150 -->

Bryan.\n\n3\n00:00:16.405 --> 00:00:20.325\nAnd in today's episode, we're gonna be\nmoving through Mac management basics.\n\n4\n00:00:20.325 --> 00:00:23.525\nAnd we got Mr. Don Pezet here to help\nus out with the knowledge there.\n\n5\n00:00:23.525 --> 00:00:25.005\nDon, how you doing, man?\n\n6\n00:00:25.005 --> 00:00:25.745\n>> I am doing great, Wes.\n\n7\n00:00:25.745 --> 00:00:28.215\nReady to jump right back into\ntaking system images and\n\n8\n00:00:28.215 --> 00:00:29.265\nI know what you're thinking.\n\n9\n00:00:29.265 --> 00:00:31.485\nHey, haven't we been doing this for\ntwo episodes now?\n\n10\n00:00:31.485 --> 00:00:33.490\nHow much more system imaging do we need?\n\n11\n00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:36.020\nWell, we've seen traditional disk images.\n\n12\n00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:37.420\nWe saw NetInstall,\n\n13\n00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.860\nwe saw NetBoot, which are basically\nthe same thing, used differently.\n\n14\n00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:43.690\nI don't wanna oversimplify.\n\n15\n00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:46.780\nBut there's one that we haven't gotten\nto yet, and that's NetRestore and\n\n16\n00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.360\nthat's the one we're gonna\ntake a look at today.\n\n17\n00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.180\nNow, NetRestore, the process for\n\n18\n00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.860\ncreating it is very similar to what\nwe've seen in the other episodes.\n\n19\n00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:58.172\nBut the source of the data is what's\nreally different about Net Restore.\n\n20\n00:00:58.172 --> 00:01:02.870\nWith Netinstall, we got to choose\nhow to take a straight up El Capitan\n\n21\n00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.790\ninstaller and\nmake a stock deployment of OS10.\n\n22\n00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.770\nAnd we saw how to use\nthe automator to customize that and\n\n23\n00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.090\nthat was really cool if you liked\nto use the automator right?\n\n24\n00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.930\nBut the automator can be a little tricky,\nit can be a little complex and so\n\n25\n00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:19.210\nsome people don't like to do that.\n\n26\n00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.120\nNet Restorer takes that\nautomator piece away.\n\n27\n00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.770\nIt doesn't stop you from using it,\n\n28\n00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.420\nyou can still use the automator, but\nwhat Net Restorer allows you to do\n\n29\n00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.440\nis to create a source image without having\nto know any scripting or automation.\n\n30\n00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.160\nAnd the way it works is by\nusing a source machine.\n\n31\n00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:39.990\nWe take a source computer, so you have a\nMac on your network somewhere, a MacBook.\n\n32\n00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.040\na Mac Pro, iMac, whatever it is right,\nso you take your Mac,\n\n33\n00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.700\nand you sit down in front of it\nwith a keyboard and mouse and\n\n34\n00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.240\nyou get it set up exactly\nthe way you want it.\n\n35\n00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.150\nNo scripting.\n\n36\n00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.570\nIf you want Office 2016 installed on it,\nyou go to Microsoft's site,\n\n37\n00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:55.950\nyou download it, you install it.\n\n38\n00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.320\nIf you want Cyber Docker or\nwhatever other software installed,\n\n39\n00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:00.920\nyou just download it and you install it.\n\n40\n00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.340\nIf you wanna change the wallpaper,\nyou just change the wallpaper.\n\n41\n00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.820\nYou do things just the way that\nyou're used to doing them.\n\n42\n00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.770\nBy hand.\nAnd once you get that computer set up\n\n43\n00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.080\nexactly the way you want it,\n\n44\n00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.830\nwe can then use that computer\nas the source of our image.\n\n45\n00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.998\nSo instead of using an El Capitan\ninstaller like we were doing with\n\n46\n00:02:18.998 --> 00:02:23.100\nNetinstall and Netboot,\nhere we use a source computer.\n\n47\n00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.170\nIt does require us to have one extra\ncomputer, but it's far easier to do.\n\n48\n00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:27.710\nBecause you're just installing stuff.\n\n49\n00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:30.130\nYou don't even have to\nlook at the automator.\n\n50\n00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:31.950\nYou just do everything right\nthere on that machine.\n\n51\n00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.270\nYou get it set up.\n\n52\n00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.930\nAnd then we build a netrestore\nimage based on that machine.\n\n53\n00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.390\nOnce we've got it,\nwe can take that restore image and\n\n54\n00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.550\ndeploy it thousands of times and every\ncomputer that we deploy that net restore\n\n55\n00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:46.480\nto will be configured\nexactly the same way.\n\n56\n00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.110\nIt'll have the software,\nit'll have the settings.\n\n57\n00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.200\nIt'll be set up just the way that\nyou want it for mirror image.\n\n58\n00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.560\nSo that's the cool part about net restore.\n\n59\n00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.040\nNow, I know what you're thinking,\n\n60\n00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.680\nhey Don that sounds really easy I\ndon't have to mess with automator,\n\n61\n00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.940\nwhy would I bother with Netinstall\nif I can just do Net restore right?\n\n62\n00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:06.160\nWell there's some pros and cons,\none of the cool things about net install\n\n63\n00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:11.110\nis that underneath is really just\na Yosemite I'm sorry not a Yosemite but\n\n64\n00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:14.960\nwhatever it is we're doing in the show and\nso you've got the el capitan installer.\n\n65\n00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:18.340\nAnd then the automator customizes\neverything, you add packages,\n\n66\n00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:19.560\nyou add steps.\n\n67\n00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.450\nAnd if I wanna change that later on,\nright, remember\n\n68\n00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:27.550\nin the last episode I added Virtualbox as\na package to one of our NetInstall images.\n\n69\n00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:30.820\nSo a new version of Virtualbox comes out,\nwhat do I do?\n\n70\n00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:35.950\nWell, I just edit that image that we made,\nedit the automator steps.\n\n71\n00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:41.080\nAnd I take the old virtualbox package out\nand I put the new virtualbox package in.\n\n72\n00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.105\nAnd now the next time I deploy\nit we'll have the new version of\n\n73\n00:03:43.105 --> 00:03:44.190\nvirtualbox just like that.\n\n74\n00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.730\nI just swapped out that package and\nI was done.\n\n75\n00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:50.550\nBut with net restore, it's not like\nthat because with net restore I've\n\n76\n00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:54.410\nalready installed virtualbox\ninside of the machine.\n\n77\n00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:57.300\nAnd then I made an image of it\nwith VirtualBox already in there.\n\n78\n00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.320\nIt's not an automator\nstep I can just swap out.\n\n79\n00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.360\nThe software's already installed.\n\n80\n00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:05.820\nNow we can edit the image file, and so\nsome applications, it's really just\n\n81\n00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:09.570\na matter of swapping out the application\nin the applications folder, and that's it.\n\n82\n00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:13.650\nBut if it was a package, then it\nprobably installed some kind of drivers.\n\n83\n00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:15.650\nAnd you can't just swap those out.\n\n84\n00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:20.910\nWhat you would have to do is deploy\nthe net restore image to a machine,\n\n85\n00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:25.360\nmake the changes that you wanted,\nand then re-image it again.\n\n86\n00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.760\nSo net restore is easier to create but\nit's harder to maintain,\n\n87\n00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:32.050\nit takes a little bit\nmore work to maintain.\n\n88\n00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:36.560\nNet install is harder to create,\nbut it's easier to maintain.\n\n89\n00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.350\nSo, I always look at it this way.\n\n90\n00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:41.200\nIf this is an image that I'm gonna\nbe using for years and years and\n\n91\n00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:45.590\nyears, I'm gonna be constantly updating\nand working with, I'll do netinstall, but\n\n92\n00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:47.390\nif this is just a one time thing,\n\n93\n00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:51.050\nI've got 50 machines that I need to\nspin up right now all the same way.\n\n94\n00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:53.030\nI'll use net restore, it's faster.\n\n95\n00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:55.380\nSo it just kind of depends\non how I intend on using it.\n\n96\n00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:57.700\nIf it's a one time thing,\nI'll use net restore.\n\n97\n00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:00.330\nIf it's something I'm gonna\nconstantly use, I use netinstall, and\n\n98\n00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:03.335\nthat's kind of where I fall on those,\nand then netboot I never use.\n\n99\n00:05:03.335 --> 00:05:05.130\n[LAUGH] I shouldn't say I never use it.\n\n100\n00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:07.778\nWhen you do Internet recovery, you're\nusing netboot, but I don't normally build\n\n101\n00:05:07.778 --> 00:05:11.190\nnetboot images, cuz when do you\nnecessarily wanna build a workstation that\n\n102\n00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:14.660\nboots off of a network, well we\ntalked about that in the netboot up.\n\n103\n00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:16.610\nLabs, things like that, might use it.\n\n104\n00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:20.700\nSo, with netrestore,\nthe key difference is that source machine.\n\n105\n00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:23.040\nNow, one quick thing I wanna throw out,\nand\n\n106\n00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:25.490\nany of you guys watching live\nwould've already heard us say this,\n\n107\n00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:31.910\nbut If we wanna build in that restore\nimage, we need two Macs not one.\n\n108\n00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:34.350\nYou need one Mac to be the source.\n\n109\n00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:36.200\nTo be the set up the way you want.\n\n110\n00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:39.170\nAnd you need another\nMac to take the image.\n\n111\n00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:44.320\nAnd when you do that, the Macs have to\nbe running the same version of Mac OS.\n\n112\n00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:47.620\nSo if I'm running El Capitan\non my source machine\n\n113\n00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:50.590\nI need to run El Capitan on a machine\nthat's going to take an image.\n\n114\n00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:54.020\nRight, for those of you watching live\nyou got to see me make that mistake,\n\n115\n00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:56.960\nmy Mac Mini is sitting here on\nthe table was running Yosemite earlier,\n\n116\n00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:59.560\nmy laptop was running El Capitan so\nI couldn't image it.\n\n117\n00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:01.670\nBut now I've got a,\nwe're all El Capitan, right?\n\n118\n00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:05.130\nSo I've got El Capitan on my source\nmachine, I've got El Capitan on my laptop,\n\n119\n00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:08.460\nand so I'll use my laptop to take\nan image of this Mac mini and\n\n120\n00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:10.460\nwe'll build that netrestore\nimage from there.\n\n121\n00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:12.670\n>> Now Don, one of the things\nthat I was wondering here,\n\n122\n00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:15.200\nyou said you have two Macs, you're\ngonna have to have a connection, right?\n\n123\n00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:17.830\nAnd Apple has various\nconnections throughout the air,\n\n124\n00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:20.260\nwhat kinda connections might\nwe be thinking about here?\n\n125\n00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.450\n>> All right, so we need to take\nan image of the hard drive.\n\n126\n00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:25.070\nAnd obviously we can't do that\nwhile the hard drive is in use.\n\n127\n00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:28.170\nIt's not gonna let us do it so\nwe need to connect it.\n\n128\n00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:30.140\nAnd we'll get a chance to see this\nwhen I start demonstrating it.\n\n129\n00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:31.710\nBut we're gonna use target mode.\n\n130\n00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:32.230\n>> Okay.\n>> So\n\n131\n00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:34.790\nwe're gonna boot our source\nmachine in target mode so\n\n132\n00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:36.860\nit just shows up as\na removable hard drive.\n\n133\n00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:40.820\nAnd to do that, we're gonna connect up and\nthere's only two connections for\n\n134\n00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:42.730\nprotocols that are supported right now.\n\n135\n00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:46.530\nThe first one is FireWire so if they're\nolder Macs, they've got FireWire ports,\n\n136\n00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:48.190\nyou can run FireWire between them.\n\n137\n00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:50.830\nBut if you've got newer Macs\nlike the two that I've got here,\n\n138\n00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:53.430\nI don't have FireWire ports\non either of these machines.\n\n139\n00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:55.070\nI'm gonna use Thunderbolt.\n\n140\n00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:57.640\nAnd Thunderbolt is a little\nbit challenging because\n\n141\n00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:00.450\nApple doesn't really include\nThunderbolt cables with anything.\n\n142\n00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:03.760\nSo you're gonna need to go out, and\nif you wanna build netrestore images,\n\n143\n00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:07.220\nyou're gonna need to go out and\nbuy a Thunderbolt cable.\n\n144\n00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:10.600\nAnd be careful with these, because there's\nThunderbolt cable that actually have\n\n145\n00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:12.860\na little lightning bolt on the cable.\n\n146\n00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:16.880\nAnd then there is display pole cables\nwhich have a little monitor on the cable.\n\n147\n00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:20.860\nThe connector is the same and if you\ngo to Amazon or somewhere like that,\n\n148\n00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:25.210\nif you wanna buy a display pole cable you\ncan find one for $5 it's no big deal.\n\n149\n00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:28.580\nBut the Thunderbolt Cable start at $35,\nright.\n\n150\n00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:29.750\nWhy are they so expensive?\n\n151\n00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:33.790\nWell, for Thunderbolt, there's\nactually a little bit of, there's like\n\n152\n00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:37.890\nsome microprocessors that are actually in\nthe connector that they use for DRM and\n\n153\n00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:39.330\ntransfer monitoring and\n\n154\n00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:41.640\nexcessive power and all that other stuff\nthat they check on the connectors.\n\n155\n00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:43.930\nAt the end of the day, it's really DRM.\n\n156\n00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:44.780\nSo.\n\n157\n00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:46.740\nSo they enforce that in the cable, and\n\n158\n00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:48.960\nthat means that I can't just\nuse a regular display port.\n\n159\n00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:54.004\nThere has to be an actual FireWire cable\nto connect between the two machines.\n\n160\n00:07:54.004 --> 00:07:55.712\nWith NetInstall we didn't need that,\nright?\n\n161\n00:07:55.712 --> 00:07:59.754\nBecause NetInstall used the El Capitan\ninstaller as its source.\n\n162\n00:07:59.754 --> 00:08:00.713\nBut here I need to use a hard drive.\n\n163\n00:08:00.713 --> 00:08:03.629\nI've gotta have a target so\nI'm gonna need a Thunderbolt cable.\n\n164\n00:08:03.629 --> 00:08:05.919\nAnd I'll need Thunderbolt\nports on my two systems or\n\n165\n00:08:05.919 --> 00:08:07.749\na FireWire if you've got older systems.\n\n166\n00:08:07.749 --> 00:08:12.452\n>> Those darn proprietary cables, I tell\nyou, and they all pick on me around here.\n\n167\n00:08:12.452 --> 00:08:16.945\nI've had probably ten tablets in the last\nfive years, and I've had about four iPads.\n\n168\n00:08:16.945 --> 00:08:19.525\nAnd Don, I remember when\nthe Lightning adapter first came out.\n\n169\n00:08:19.525 --> 00:08:24.055\nYou couldn't just any plug, I don't know\nif they hadn't licensed it, and try to\n\n170\n00:08:24.055 --> 00:08:27.605\nplug into the Lightning because it would\nsay this is not a recognized charger.\n\n171\n00:08:27.605 --> 00:08:29.557\nAnd it wouldn't charge your device.\n\n172\n00:08:29.557 --> 00:08:32.088\n>> Yeah, and that's how Thunderbolt is,\nit's built into that cable.\n\n173\n00:08:32.088 --> 00:08:35.070\nSo you gotta have the right cable,\nthat's an important piece.\n\n174\n00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:37.820\nAll right well, let's say we want to\nbuild one of these NetRestore images,\n\n175\n00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:38.790\nthat's the way that I wanna go.\n\n176\n00:08:38.790 --> 00:08:41.360\nSo step one, get a source machine, right?\n\n177\n00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:44.578\nSo, right here on my desk I've got\na little Mac Mini sitting here that we're\n\n178\n00:08:44.578 --> 00:08:46.304\ngonna use and it's running El Capitan.\n\n179\n00:08:46.304 --> 00:08:49.940\nI haven't really done much to it,\nI think I did install Cyberduck on it.\n\n180\n00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:52.470\nBut we'll take it,\nwe'll customize it a little bit,\n\n181\n00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:54.430\nwe'll get it set the way we want.\n\n182\n00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:57.010\nAnd the nice part about that is, it's just\nlike using a regular computer, right.\n\n183\n00:08:57.010 --> 00:08:58.330\nSo let's pull up this little Mac Mini.\n\n184\n00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:00.550\nSo I've got my Mac Mini here\nwhich is gonna be our source.\n\n185\n00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:03.810\nAnd it's running El Capitan, we got\nour nice little cloudy mountains here.\n\n186\n00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:07.840\nAnd I'm just gonna customize it a bit,\nright, and just start to make changes.\n\n187\n00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:12.804\nMaybe I don't like the mountain wallpaper\ncuz I don't actually know where\n\n188\n00:09:12.804 --> 00:09:16.133\nEl Capitan is and\nI'm not some giant fan of parks.\n\n189\n00:09:16.133 --> 00:09:19.790\nSo I might want to go into my System\nPreferences, start to change my wallpaper.\n\n190\n00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:21.840\nAnd I click on the wrong thing here.\n\n191\n00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:23.420\nSo I might wanna jump into that.\n\n192\n00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:25.410\nI might want to install some software,\nright.\n\n193\n00:09:25.410 --> 00:09:27.690\nWhatever it is that I wanna do,\nI start customizing it.\n\n194\n00:09:27.690 --> 00:09:30.210\nAnd again,\nI'm not using the Automator here,\n\n195\n00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:32.160\nI'm not doing any crazy scripting or\nanything.\n\n196\n00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:35.730\nI'm just coming in here and\ncustomizing things the way that I want.\n\n197\n00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:38.530\nI can set my power saver options,\n\n198\n00:09:38.530 --> 00:09:40.720\nwhich I probably should have done\nin there while I was in there.\n\n199\n00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:43.280\nSo I can go into my Energy Saver and\nI can start to tweak these.\n\n200\n00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:46.204\nMaybe I never want this machine to go to\nsleep or I want to adjust these values.\n\n201\n00:09:46.204 --> 00:09:50.141\nSo I can kinda bump them around\nto whatever it is that we need.\n\n202\n00:09:50.141 --> 00:09:54.448\nAnd Files and Applications, right,\nI can go and install something,\n\n203\n00:09:54.448 --> 00:09:56.420\nwhat do I want to install today?\n\n204\n00:09:56.420 --> 00:10:00.230\nMaybe I want the,\nhow about the, Google Chrome.\n\n205\n00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:02.950\nI want the Chrome web browser\non this machine, or Vivaldi, or\n\n206\n00:10:02.950 --> 00:10:04.720\nwhatever browser we're using this week.\n\n207\n00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:07.301\nSo I can just go in and install it.\n\n208\n00:10:07.301 --> 00:10:10.045\nAnd I don't have to worry about\nwhether they have a package file.\n\n209\n00:10:10.045 --> 00:10:13.310\nCuz a lot of software we download\ndoesn't come with a package file.\n\n210\n00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:16.410\nAnd so it's a little bit harder\nto deploy it with an Automator\n\n211\n00:10:16.410 --> 00:10:18.970\nscript because Automator's\nexpecting a package file.\n\n212\n00:10:18.970 --> 00:10:21.210\nSo with this,\nI don't care if it has a package file.\n\n213\n00:10:21.210 --> 00:10:23.850\nIf it does, I can just run the package,\nit'll install it.\n\n214\n00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:27.254\nBut if it just has a DMG with an\napplication inside, then that's fine too.\n\n215\n00:10:27.254 --> 00:10:31.321\nI'll open it up and I'll drop it\ninto my Applications folder so\n\n216\n00:10:31.321 --> 00:10:33.250\nwe'll get that fired along.\n\n217\n00:10:33.250 --> 00:10:36.570\nAnd I would just install\nthings however I want.\n\n218\n00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:40.420\nMaybe the dock down here,\nI know I'm not gonna use Notes.\n\n219\n00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:43.060\nAnd so I can go down here and\nI can remove these from the dock.\n\n220\n00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:45.420\nAnd we'll just kinda get\nthat one out of there.\n\n221\n00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:47.480\niTunes, when am I gonna use that thing?\n\n222\n00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:48.220\nSo I'll go in here and\n\n223\n00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:51.970\nI'll remove iTunes and anything I don't\nwant my end users to have to deal with.\n\n224\n00:10:51.970 --> 00:10:55.530\nI know my average end user's never\ngoing to go into System Preferences, so\n\n225\n00:10:55.530 --> 00:10:57.530\nwe can get that one out of there.\n\n226\n00:10:57.530 --> 00:10:59.880\nAnd so I'm just customizing the machine,\nright,\n\n227\n00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:01.420\nmaking it a little more like what we want.\n\n228\n00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:03.080\nI'll get rid of iBooks.\n\n229\n00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:06.839\n>> Don, would you say that in this you\nmight want to really pay attention to what\n\n230\n00:11:06.839 --> 00:11:08.856\napplications you do have in your image?\n\n231\n00:11:08.856 --> 00:11:14.138\nBcause you said of the complexities of\ntrying to add an application later?\n\n232\n00:11:14.138 --> 00:11:14.989\nJust in general?\n>> Yeah,\n\n233\n00:11:14.989 --> 00:11:18.450\nthese are the things we\nwant our users to have.\n\n234\n00:11:18.450 --> 00:11:20.450\nAnd if there's something that\nrequires a lot of steps,\n\n235\n00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:22.110\nlike installing Microsoft Office, right?\n\n236\n00:11:22.110 --> 00:11:22.950\nMicrosoft Office has\n\n237\n00:11:22.950 --> 00:11:25.400\nquite a few little steps you have\nto go through to get it installed.\n\n238\n00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:27.557\nIt's not as simple as, drag the icon and\n\n239\n00:11:27.557 --> 00:11:30.296\ndrop it cuz it's got its\nupdater that it has to run.\n\n240\n00:11:30.296 --> 00:11:33.000\nAnd I can't automate it\nrunning the updater.\n\n241\n00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.304\nBut here I could install it, and\nI could manually run the updater.\n\n242\n00:11:35.304 --> 00:11:38.244\nAnd now I know I'm pushing out an updated\nversion of Office every time I roll\n\n243\n00:11:38.244 --> 00:11:39.430\nout this deployment.\n\n244\n00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:40.550\nThere could be other software,\n\n245\n00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:46.310\nlike the Adobe Creative Suite,\nwhere you don't install Adobe Photoshop.\n\n246\n00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:49.120\nInstead, you install\nthe Adobe Creative Suite launcher,\n\n247\n00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:52.458\nand then from inside of the launcher\nyou install the other applications.\n\n248\n00:11:52.458 --> 00:11:55.709\nSo I could go through those steps, but I\nhave to make sure to log out of that first\n\n249\n00:11:55.709 --> 00:11:57.696\ncuz otherwise my credentials\nwould stay in it.\n\n250\n00:11:57.696 --> 00:12:00.895\nAnd then I roll out this NetRestore image\nand everybody's logged in as me, and\n\n251\n00:12:00.895 --> 00:12:02.720\nit just wreaks havoc on the network.\n\n252\n00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:05.710\nSo those are all things that I've\ngotta remember as we roll that out.\n\n253\n00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:08.080\nAll right, so\nnow I've got Chrome installed.\n\n254\n00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:11.245\nAnd maybe I'll launch Chrome one time\njust to make sure it actually works.\n\n255\n00:12:11.245 --> 00:12:14.430\nCuz, who knows, maybe it got damaged.\n\n256\n00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:16.160\nSo we'll go ahead and open that one.\n\n257\n00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:19.290\nAnd even that security setting right\nthere, we saw a gatekeeper warning me,\n\n258\n00:12:19.290 --> 00:12:20.900\nhey, this program was\ndownloaded from the Internet.\n\n259\n00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:22.410\nAre you sure you want to run it?\n\n260\n00:12:22.410 --> 00:12:25.610\nSo I'm authorizing it to run and\n\n261\n00:12:25.610 --> 00:12:29.680\nletting it fire up here and,\nmy goodness, that is small.\n\n262\n00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:32.366\nI can't see, whatever, we'll pick this\nbutton, I'm sure this button's fine.\n\n263\n00:12:32.366 --> 00:12:33.973\nSo [LAUGH] we can get this stuff set so\n\n264\n00:12:33.973 --> 00:12:36.310\nour end users don't have to deal with it,\nright?\n\n265\n00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:40.320\nThey're already going to be cleared\non this stuff and it's all set up and\n\n266\n00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:40.969\nready to go.\n\n267\n00:12:40.969 --> 00:12:45.094\nAll right, so once I've got this all set\nup just the way I want it, the next thing\n\n268\n00:12:45.094 --> 00:12:49.304\nI need to do is to boot into target mode\nand take the image of this machine, right?\n\n269\n00:12:49.304 --> 00:12:52.023\nAnd I did hardly anything here,\nbut for you you guys,\n\n270\n00:12:52.023 --> 00:12:55.294\nyou're gonna install all your\nline of business applications.\n\n271\n00:12:55.294 --> 00:12:58.691\nYou're gonna set up maybe even\na local user account for Help Desk,\n\n272\n00:12:58.691 --> 00:13:02.430\nwhatever you wanna do, you get it set\nup just the way you want it, right.\n\n273\n00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:05.500\nAnd once we've got all that in place,\nthen I'm just gonna shut the machine down,\n\n274\n00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:06.850\ncuz I need to boot into target mode.\n\n275\n00:13:06.850 --> 00:13:10.110\nSo booting in the target\nmode's actually pretty simple.\n\n276\n00:13:10.110 --> 00:13:11.992\nWe start by shutting the system down and\n\n277\n00:13:11.992 --> 00:13:16.412\nwhile it's shut down,\nI'm gonna hook up that Thunderbolt cable.\n\n278\n00:13:16.412 --> 00:13:19.840\nI'm gonna hook it up between\nthe Mac Mini here and my laptop.\n\n279\n00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:22.720\nSo that's gonna shut down,\nI'm gonna plug in this cable.\n\n280\n00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:26.680\nAnd then what I'm gonna do is, after I've\ngot the Thunderbolt cable hooked up,\n\n281\n00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:28.350\ncuz it does need to be\nhooked up when you boot.\n\n282\n00:13:29.388 --> 00:13:34.170\nAnd once I've got that hooked up,\nI'm gonna power on the Mac Mini.\n\n283\n00:13:34.170 --> 00:13:37.480\nAnd while I'm doing it I'm gonna\nhold the letter T on the keyboard.\n\n284\n00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:40.810\nSo I'm holding T on the keyboard and\npressing Power.\n\n285\n00:13:40.810 --> 00:13:43.230\nSo T for target mode and\nwe're gonna power up.\n\n286\n00:13:43.230 --> 00:13:46.740\nNow if you see the Apple logo up here and\na little status bar,\n\n287\n00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:50.200\nthen you've missed it and you're gonna\nhave to power it down again and try again.\n\n288\n00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:51.830\nBut what you should see is\nwhat we've got right here.\n\n289\n00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:54.380\nYou should see the big Thunderbolt\nicon appears on the screen, and\n\n290\n00:13:54.380 --> 00:13:56.690\nit moves around as like\na mini screen saver.\n\n291\n00:13:57.790 --> 00:14:02.250\nOnce we boot in target mode, this\nMac Mini is now a removable hard drive.\n\n292\n00:14:02.250 --> 00:14:04.370\nIt just thinks that it's a hard drive.\n\n293\n00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:07.250\nAnd I can take it and\nI can plug it into other computers, and\n\n294\n00:14:07.250 --> 00:14:09.520\nthey'll just see it as storage.\n\n295\n00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:15.580\nSo the cool part there is the internal\nhard drive of this Mac Mini is now active,\n\n296\n00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:16.910\nbut not in use.\n\n297\n00:14:16.910 --> 00:14:18.840\nI'm not running the OS from it.\n\n298\n00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:21.360\nSo I can take an image of this machine,\nI can image it.\n\n299\n00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:25.290\nI can't image my own machine,\ncuz I'm running it, right, I'm using it.\n\n300\n00:14:25.290 --> 00:14:28.330\nBut with this one I can, right, so\nit's now disconnected and it's available.\n\n301\n00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:31.570\nAnd so from here, that's really all\nI need to do on my source machine.\n\n302\n00:14:31.570 --> 00:14:34.330\nMy source machine is technically done and\n\n303\n00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:40.070\nI can jump over to another machine\nsomewhere and start to take that image.\n\n304\n00:14:40.070 --> 00:14:42.710\nSo let me, I've got so\nmany keyboards on the desk today,\n\n305\n00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:45.030\nlet me bump this keyboard out of the way.\n\n306\n00:14:45.030 --> 00:14:48.440\nAnd switch back over here to my\nlaptop where I can take that image.\n\n307\n00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:52.830\nSo on my laptop,\nit's gonna see that hard drive and\n\n308\n00:14:52.830 --> 00:14:56.150\nwe'll be able to jump in there and\ngrab an image, if I know my password.\n\n309\n00:14:57.750 --> 00:14:58.840\nAll right, so here we go.\n\n310\n00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:01.440\nSo now I'm on my laptop and if we look\nover here you can see where I've got my\n\n311\n00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:04.550\nMacintosh hard drive,\nthat's my hard drive.\n\n312\n00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:06.750\nI've got an External SSD, right,\n\n313\n00:15:06.750 --> 00:15:10.200\nthat's the little solid state drive\nI got sitting here beside my laptop.\n\n314\n00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:13.430\nAnd then I've got Macintosh HD, right?\n\n315\n00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:16.330\nWell, I've already got Macintosh HD\nup here, now I've got another one.\n\n316\n00:15:16.330 --> 00:15:19.530\nThe first one is the one in my laptop,\nthat's the SSD here in my laptop.\n\n317\n00:15:19.530 --> 00:15:21.758\nThis one is the one for my Mac Mini.\n\n318\n00:15:21.758 --> 00:15:24.825\nNow, how do I know that,\nhow do I know that for sure?\n\n319\n00:15:24.825 --> 00:15:27.814\nCuz, boy it would really stink to\noverwrite one when you thought you were\n\n320\n00:15:27.814 --> 00:15:30.667\noverwriting the other one, or\naccidentally image your own laptop.\n\n321\n00:15:30.667 --> 00:15:33.484\nAnd then you send out your own personal\ndata out to 1,000 machines on the network,\n\n322\n00:15:33.484 --> 00:15:34.520\nthat would be bad.\n\n323\n00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:37.260\nSo we can always verify,\nthere's a few different ways.\n\n324\n00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:39.360\nThe easiest way to identify\nit is simply the icon.\n\n325\n00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:41.400\nRemovable media has a different icon.\n\n326\n00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:44.640\nAnd so it shows that a yellow drive\ninstead of the little hard drive picture\n\n327\n00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:46.590\nthat we see on our own, right.\n\n328\n00:15:46.590 --> 00:15:48.799\nBut the other place you can\nsee it is in Disk Utility.\n\n329\n00:15:48.799 --> 00:15:53.800\nIf I fire up my Disk Utility, it's gonna\nlook at all the disks in my system.\n\n330\n00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:56.620\nAnd when I look at it,\nthere's Macintosh HD, and\n\n331\n00:15:56.620 --> 00:15:59.046\nsee how this section is labeled Internal?\n\n332\n00:15:59.046 --> 00:16:02.546\nSo that's the Apple SSD from my laptop.\n\n333\n00:16:02.546 --> 00:16:04.910\nAnd so I've got it, it's 500 gigs.\n\n334\n00:16:04.910 --> 00:16:07.690\nAnd then when I look\ndown here under External,\n\n335\n00:16:07.690 --> 00:16:10.200\nI can see here's the other Macintosh HD.\n\n336\n00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:13.910\nIt's external to my system, and\nit's an Apple hard drive in the Mac Mini,\n\n337\n00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:15.970\nand it's 1 TB in size.\n\n338\n00:16:15.970 --> 00:16:19.910\nThat's the one that is the Mac Mini that\nwe're gonna use for our NetRestore source.\n\n339\n00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:23.566\n>> Now Don, throughout the images that\nwe've been discussing over the last couple\n\n340\n00:16:23.566 --> 00:16:26.050\nof episodes,\nwe've had a couple utilities, right?\n\n341\n00:16:26.050 --> 00:16:27.867\nOne of them, we've just seen there,\nthe Disk Utility.\n\n342\n00:16:27.867 --> 00:16:31.938\nNow, is this gonna be the utility that\nwe're gonna use in order to create\n\n343\n00:16:31.938 --> 00:16:32.617\nthe image?\n\n344\n00:16:32.617 --> 00:16:36.275\n>> No, now you actually can use Disk\nUtility to create an image of a disk, but\n\n345\n00:16:36.275 --> 00:16:39.040\nit's not suitable for NetRestore, right.\n\n346\n00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:40.951\nSo for example, I'm in DiskUtility.\n\n347\n00:16:40.951 --> 00:16:46.243\nIf I click on that Macintosh HD, so\nthis is the hard drive for that Mac Mini,\n\n348\n00:16:46.243 --> 00:16:52.200\nI can go up to my File menu and I can say\nNew Image > Image from \"MacIntosh HD\".\n\n349\n00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:56.370\nThat will create a DMG, right,\na disk image of that hard drive.\n\n350\n00:16:56.370 --> 00:16:59.370\nAnd then I've got it, and\nwhat do I do with it?\n\n351\n00:16:59.370 --> 00:17:03.830\nNot much, you can't boot off a DMG file,\nor at least I don't know how to.\n\n352\n00:17:03.830 --> 00:17:05.680\nIt doesn't contain a recovery partition.\n\n353\n00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:10.028\nIt doesn't have everything needed,\nit's just an image of that hard drive.\n\n354\n00:17:10.028 --> 00:17:12.350\nSo I could get files out of it,\nif I wanted to use it as a backup,\n\n355\n00:17:12.350 --> 00:17:13.660\nI could do that.\n\n356\n00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:15.940\nBut otherwise the utility\nof that is pretty limited.\n\n357\n00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:17.270\nSo instead,\n\n358\n00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:20.870\nwe're gonna jump back to our System Image\nUtility that we saw in the last episode.\n\n359\n00:17:20.870 --> 00:17:23.830\nSo I'm gonna fire up\nthe System Image Utility and\n\n360\n00:17:23.830 --> 00:17:27.360\nwhat it's gonna do is ask what\nI'm gonna use as a source.\n\n361\n00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:31.890\nAnd in the last episode we were doing\nNetInstall, or NetBoot, either one.\n\n362\n00:17:31.890 --> 00:17:36.370\nAnd for those, your source is going\nto be your El Capitan installer, and\n\n363\n00:17:36.370 --> 00:17:39.020\nthat's exactly what I chose before, right?\n\n364\n00:17:39.020 --> 00:17:42.840\nBut this time,\nright there I can see Macintosh HD,\n\n365\n00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:46.770\nand it's got that icon that lets\nme know it's an external drive.\n\n366\n00:17:46.770 --> 00:17:49.050\nThat's the hard drive of the Mac Mini,\nall right?\n\n367\n00:17:49.050 --> 00:17:51.830\nNow, if any of you guys are watching live,\nyou saw it before the show.\n\n368\n00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:54.860\nWhen I fired this up the first time,\nthat hard drive didn't show up.\n\n369\n00:17:54.860 --> 00:17:57.670\nAnd the reason was the Mac Mini\nwas running Yosemite.\n\n370\n00:17:57.670 --> 00:18:00.450\nAnd if I'm running a different version,\nI can't image it.\n\n371\n00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:03.200\nWe've gotta be at the same version,\nand now I am.\n\n372\n00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:06.440\nSo I've got El Capitan on my laptop,\nEl Capitan on the Mac Mini,\n\n373\n00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:08.380\nand it sees it just fine.\n\n374\n00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:10.390\nThat's going to to be my source.\n\n375\n00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:14.610\nAnd it's letting me know that as of\nright now, yes, it's a 1TB drive.\n\n376\n00:18:14.610 --> 00:18:18.100\nBut I'm gonna have 15 gigs\nof data that I'm backing up.\n\n377\n00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:21.590\nNow, 15 gigs of data,\nthat sounds a little odd, right?\n\n378\n00:18:21.590 --> 00:18:25.540\nIf I go back into my Disk Utility and\nI look at that disk here,\n\n379\n00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:28.784\nwhen I look at the External S,\nor, not that one.\n\n380\n00:18:28.784 --> 00:18:32.972\nIf I look at the Macintosh HD, there we\ngo, and I look at it, well it shows right\n\n381\n00:18:32.972 --> 00:18:37.242\nhere, used 15.49 gigs, right,\nthat's what we're using on that disk.\n\n382\n00:18:37.242 --> 00:18:43.076\nAnd so the image is gonna be 15.49 gigs or\n15.5 gigs, right.\n\n383\n00:18:43.076 --> 00:18:46.008\nIt'll actually be a little bigger cuz\nit'll bake in recovery into this thing\n\n384\n00:18:46.008 --> 00:18:48.050\ntoo, but\nthat's basically what it's gonna build.\n\n385\n00:18:48.050 --> 00:18:51.420\nSo I need to make sure I have that\nmuch disk space and fortunately I do.\n\n386\n00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:53.740\nSo it doesn't matter that\nMac Mini's drive is a terabyte and\n\n387\n00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:55.670\nmy hard drive is only 500 gigs.\n\n388\n00:18:55.670 --> 00:18:58.980\nCuz it's gonna compress this down and\nwe saw that in some of the other episodes.\n\n389\n00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:04.150\nAll right, now from there on my next\nscreen it's gonna ask what I'm gonna do.\n\n390\n00:19:04.150 --> 00:19:07.780\nAnd notice how NetInstall is not\neven an option anymore, right.\n\n391\n00:19:07.780 --> 00:19:13.650\nNetInstall, you use the El Capitan\nInstaller as your source image, right?\n\n392\n00:19:13.650 --> 00:19:16.600\nI've already told it I'm not gonna\nuse the El Capitan installer,\n\n393\n00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:17.970\nI'm gonna use a hard drive.\n\n394\n00:19:17.970 --> 00:19:19.380\nSo NetInstall's gone.\n\n395\n00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:21.458\nI can still do NetBoot though.\n\n396\n00:19:21.458 --> 00:19:24.030\nI could NetBoot off of this image,\n\n397\n00:19:24.030 --> 00:19:25.950\nan image built exactly\nthe way that I want it.\n\n398\n00:19:25.950 --> 00:19:28.440\nAnd so I can build that and\nthen have it available.\n\n399\n00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:30.390\nBut what I want is NetRestore.\n\n400\n00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:33.750\nI wanna be able to take this image and\nmaybe I wanna restore it back to this\n\n401\n00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:35.310\nmachine in case I have\na hard drive failure.\n\n402\n00:19:35.310 --> 00:19:36.410\nAnd I just wanna use it as a backup.\n\n403\n00:19:36.410 --> 00:19:39.020\nYou can do that.\nYou do one NetRestore backup on every\n\n404\n00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:41.590\nsingle Mac on your network and\nnow you can restore any of them.\n\n405\n00:19:41.590 --> 00:19:45.180\nIt's faster to use Time Machine but\nit certainly would work, right.\n\n406\n00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:48.590\nOr I could take this one image, and\nrestore it to 1,000 machines and\n\n407\n00:19:48.590 --> 00:19:49.360\nhave them all be identical.\n\n408\n00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:50.689\nThat's how we're gonna use this.\n\n409\n00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:54.950\nAll right, the rest of the wizard\nreally plays out just like we saw with\n\n410\n00:19:54.950 --> 00:19:56.940\nNetInstall and the other guys, right.\n\n411\n00:19:56.940 --> 00:19:59.000\nSo it's got the Customize button.\n\n412\n00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:00.880\nI can go into the automator and\n\n413\n00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:03.924\nautomate things just like I did\nwith NetInstall if I want, right.\n\n414\n00:20:03.924 --> 00:20:06.240\nBut I don't have to because, technically,\n\n415\n00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:09.330\nI've already got the machine\nset up the way that I want.\n\n416\n00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:13.120\nAnd so as I move forward, I may just leave\nall these blank because the machine's\n\n417\n00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:15.570\nalready set up the way that I want.\n\n418\n00:20:15.570 --> 00:20:18.190\nBut there are some things,\nlike the computer name,\n\n419\n00:20:18.190 --> 00:20:19.590\nthat we might need to change.\n\n420\n00:20:19.590 --> 00:20:23.020\nYou don't wanna have 1,000 computers\nthat all have the same name, right?\n\n421\n00:20:23.020 --> 00:20:25.290\nSo we'll wanna give\nthat some kinda prefix.\n\n422\n00:20:25.290 --> 00:20:28.710\nAnd maybe these are lab machines so I'll\nprefix it with just the word LAB, right?\n\n423\n00:20:28.710 --> 00:20:30.899\nSo I'll have some kind of\ndifferentiation there.\n\n424\n00:20:32.470 --> 00:20:35.159\nThen as we move forward,\nif I wanna connect to a directory server,\n\n425\n00:20:35.159 --> 00:20:35.742\nI can do that.\n\n426\n00:20:35.742 --> 00:20:40.832\nIf I want to automatically install to\na drive, and remember, just like with\n\n427\n00:20:40.832 --> 00:20:45.620\nNetInstall, if I don't check this\nthen the user is gonna see a wizard.\n\n428\n00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:48.620\nThey're going to have pick\nthe hard drive they deploy to.\n\n429\n00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:53.127\nBut if I check this and I tell a hard\ndrive to deploy it to like Macintosh HD,\n\n430\n00:20:53.127 --> 00:20:57.670\nthen on the machine it'll automatically\nerase the drive, download this,\n\n431\n00:20:57.670 --> 00:20:59.310\nand drop it on the system.\n\n432\n00:20:59.310 --> 00:21:02.260\nAnd the user will have a fairly\nunattended installation, right,\n\n433\n00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:03.230\nthey don't have to get involved in it.\n\n434\n00:21:03.230 --> 00:21:06.430\nSo that's what I'm gonna do,\nI'm gonna set that, all right.\n\n435\n00:21:06.430 --> 00:21:07.610\nAnd then we can give it a name and so\n\n436\n00:21:07.610 --> 00:21:13.780\nI'm just gonna call this\na NetRestore of the Lab Mac Mini.\n\n437\n00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:15.760\nSo that I can remember what it is.\n\n438\n00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:22.170\nAnd I'm gonna give this one a, let me get\na specific index number, I'll do 5002.\n\n439\n00:21:22.170 --> 00:21:25.784\nI think yesterday we did 5000 and 5001.\n\n440\n00:21:25.784 --> 00:21:28.160\nLet me go to 5003 just to make\nsure I don't have any duplicates.\n\n441\n00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:29.663\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So I'm gonna give it a name cuz if I'm\n\n442\n00:21:29.663 --> 00:21:32.445\nusing this for a lab I might wanna\nstore this on more than one server, so\n\n443\n00:21:32.445 --> 00:21:35.130\nI'm setting myself up to be\nable to do that right now.\n\n444\n00:21:35.130 --> 00:21:37.090\nSo, I'll get all of that kinda plugged in.\n\n445\n00:21:37.090 --> 00:21:41.210\nNotice this last option,\nInclude OS X Recovery Partition.\n\n446\n00:21:41.210 --> 00:21:43.870\nThis is the big difference\nbetween this and a regular DMG,\n\n447\n00:21:43.870 --> 00:21:48.020\nis that here I'm gonna have\na recovery partition baked into this.\n\n448\n00:21:48.020 --> 00:21:48.950\nI don't have to do that.\n\n449\n00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:51.480\nYou don't have to distribute\nthe recovery partition.\n\n450\n00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:53.620\nPretty much every Mac made in the last,\nI think,\n\n451\n00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:56.370\nfour years, you can do Internet recovery.\n\n452\n00:21:56.370 --> 00:21:58.690\nSo if you don't the recover\npartition on your hard drive,\n\n453\n00:21:58.690 --> 00:22:03.570\nyou boot up holding Cmd+R, then it's\ngonna boot up, see no recovery, and\n\n454\n00:22:03.570 --> 00:22:04.980\nit's gonna go out on the Internet.\n\n455\n00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:07.950\nIt'll ask you for wireless if it needs\nit or it'll use your wired connection.\n\n456\n00:22:07.950 --> 00:22:11.230\nAnd it'll pull down a recovery\nimage right from Apple's website.\n\n457\n00:22:11.230 --> 00:22:12.310\nAnd that works great.\n\n458\n00:22:12.310 --> 00:22:14.070\nSo we don't have to distribute it.\n\n459\n00:22:14.070 --> 00:22:16.670\nI like to, I like to have recovery\npartitions on my system so\n\n460\n00:22:16.670 --> 00:22:18.370\nI'm gonna leave that checked, all right.\n\n461\n00:22:18.370 --> 00:22:19.950\nThen we'll just move forward on that,\n\n462\n00:22:19.950 --> 00:22:22.430\nand it's gonna ask if I\nwanna pick the hardware.\n\n463\n00:22:22.430 --> 00:22:26.860\nNow, I've got a Mac Mini, and\nI built the image on a Mac Mini.\n\n464\n00:22:26.860 --> 00:22:29.120\nAnd so that might be all that\nit's really suitable for.\n\n465\n00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:32.390\nI might have power settings in\nthere that are not really good for\n\n466\n00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:35.480\na MacBook, for example.\n\n467\n00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:39.600\nAnd so I might want to restrict\nthe hardware that I deploy it to.\n\n468\n00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:44.290\nAnd you can even get really strict on\nthis, you can say particular Mac Minis.\n\n469\n00:22:44.290 --> 00:22:47.800\nLike, hey, this one's got enough hardware\non it that it's not gonna work for\n\n470\n00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:48.870\nthe older Mac Minis.\n\n471\n00:22:48.870 --> 00:22:50.740\nIt's only gonna work on the newer ones.\n\n472\n00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:54.050\nAnd so we can go through and\nstart to kinda cut this down and\n\n473\n00:22:54.050 --> 00:22:56.090\nlimit the amount of systems\nthat it'll be supported on.\n\n474\n00:22:56.090 --> 00:22:59.580\nSo you can really restrict that and\ncontrol it and kinda define that.\n\n475\n00:22:59.580 --> 00:23:01.600\nI'm gonna leave mine open right now but\n\n476\n00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:03.680\nin real life land you'll\nusually wanna tweak that a bit.\n\n477\n00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:08.390\nAll right, after that I can filter\nthe MAC addresses that are allowed to\n\n478\n00:23:08.390 --> 00:23:11.340\neven see this image, cuz I might not\nwant everybody to be able to see it.\n\n479\n00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:14.370\nIf this is a backup of my computer,\n\n480\n00:23:14.370 --> 00:23:17.040\nI don't want everybody in\nthe network to see that backup.\n\n481\n00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:20.460\nCuz anybody who's bored could boot\nup their computer to the network and\n\n482\n00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:22.310\nsay yeah, restore Don's image.\n\n483\n00:23:22.310 --> 00:23:23.760\nAnd now they've got a copy of all my data.\n\n484\n00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:25.520\nI don't want that, right?\n\n485\n00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:27.080\nIf it's just a lab machine,\nwhat do I care, right?\n\n486\n00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:29.340\nBut if I'm doing backups of people's\nmachines I don't want that.\n\n487\n00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:32.300\nSo I might say hey,\nI'm gonna back up Don's Mac.\n\n488\n00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:34.270\nAnd when I do that, for\n\n489\n00:23:34.270 --> 00:23:39.320\nthat image, I'm only going to allow\nthis particular client to see it.\n\n490\n00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:42.367\nSo now they'd have to be at my\ncomputer to restore my image.\n\n491\n00:23:42.367 --> 00:23:45.659\nAnd if they're at my computer, I've got\nbigger problems to worry about, right?\n\n492\n00:23:45.659 --> 00:23:48.172\nSo that one's ind of\nalready dealt with for me.\n\n493\n00:23:48.172 --> 00:23:51.745\nNow, if I lose my computer and I have to\nreplace it, someone's gonna have to edit\n\n494\n00:23:51.745 --> 00:23:54.691\nthis image and come back and\nadd those additional MAC addresses for\n\n495\n00:23:54.691 --> 00:23:57.130\nthe new computer so\nit'll be supported and detected.\n\n496\n00:23:57.130 --> 00:23:58.921\nSo that's one way that we can do it.\n\n497\n00:23:58.921 --> 00:24:01.004\nThis only applies for network installs.\n\n498\n00:24:01.004 --> 00:24:04.115\nI'm gonna show you in another episode\nhow we can do USB installs too, and\n\n499\n00:24:04.115 --> 00:24:05.750\nthis doesn't apply to USB installs.\n\n500\n00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:10.290\nAll right, after that, it's got enough\ninformation so I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n501\n00:24:10.290 --> 00:24:10.810\nthrow this.\n\n502\n00:24:10.810 --> 00:24:14.554\nI'll put it on my external SSD so\nI don't run out of hard drive space.\n\n503\n00:24:14.554 --> 00:24:19.365\nAnd I'll throw it right over there\nwith our other images from yesterday,\n\n504\n00:24:19.365 --> 00:24:20.460\nand there we go.\n\n505\n00:24:20.460 --> 00:24:22.610\nIt's going to start\nbuilding that net restore.\n\n506\n00:24:22.610 --> 00:24:25.220\nIt's gathering all the data\noff that other machine.\n\n507\n00:24:25.220 --> 00:24:26.940\nIt's building that 15 gig image.\n\n508\n00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:31.670\nIt's putting in a recovery partition,\nand it's going to compress it.\n\n509\n00:24:31.670 --> 00:24:34.580\nSo I don't expect this image to be 15 and\na half gigs.\n\n510\n00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:36.650\nI think we saw with\nthe images we took yesterday,\n\n511\n00:24:36.650 --> 00:24:38.630\nit ended up being more like 7 and\na half gigs.\n\n512\n00:24:38.630 --> 00:24:40.560\nSo I expect to see something like that.\n\n513\n00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:45.720\nSo it's gonna build up and\nnow I'm going to have a net restore image.\n\n514\n00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:48.790\n>> We had a good question that\ncome in the chat room there, Don.\n\n515\n00:24:48.790 --> 00:24:51.240\nIn some other systems that we have,\nwe have to strip off things,\n\n516\n00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:53.350\nlike unique IDs and stuff like this.\n\n517\n00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:54.660\nNow, do you have to do this?\n\n518\n00:24:54.660 --> 00:24:57.895\nDo you have to make this more of a generic\nimage to apply to those different\n\n519\n00:24:57.895 --> 00:24:58.437\nmachines?\n\n520\n00:24:58.437 --> 00:24:59.730\n>> No, you don't.\n\n521\n00:24:59.730 --> 00:25:04.045\nSo the question is kinda centering on\nSysprep, which is a Microsoft utility.\n\n522\n00:25:04.045 --> 00:25:06.250\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> In the Microsoft Windows world,\n\n523\n00:25:06.250 --> 00:25:10.650\nevery Windows installation that\nyou do has this unique identifier.\n\n524\n00:25:10.650 --> 00:25:12.680\nIt's called a SID, a security identifier.\n\n525\n00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:15.120\nEvery machine has one,\nevery user account has one.\n\n526\n00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:18.940\nAnd if you clone a machine in\nthe Windows world and you have\n\n527\n00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:22.600\ntwo machines with the same security\nidentifier, it causes a lot of problems.\n\n528\n00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:24.579\nSo for you network admins that\nare out there that work with Windows,\n\n529\n00:25:24.579 --> 00:25:26.380\nyou know that, you're familiar with that.\n\n530\n00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:30.214\nWell, remember that Mac OS\nunder the hood is running BSD,\n\n531\n00:25:30.214 --> 00:25:31.940\nit's running a flavor of Unix.\n\n532\n00:25:31.940 --> 00:25:36.440\nAnd in the Unix world, you don't have\na unique identifier for your computer.\n\n533\n00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:41.390\nYou can have 1,000 machines built\noff of the same exact image, and\n\n534\n00:25:41.390 --> 00:25:42.230\nit doesn't matter.\n\n535\n00:25:42.230 --> 00:25:43.630\nIt doesn't affect things.\n\n536\n00:25:43.630 --> 00:25:48.830\nIt can be a little hairy if you have 1,000\nmachines all at the same name, right,\n\n537\n00:25:48.830 --> 00:25:50.170\nand Apple won't let you do that.\n\n538\n00:25:50.170 --> 00:25:52.670\nThat if I deploy multiple\nmachines with the same name,\n\n539\n00:25:52.670 --> 00:25:54.050\nthey'll automatically rename themselves.\n\n540\n00:25:54.050 --> 00:25:56.320\nAnd you might have seen this,\nthere was a bug.\n\n541\n00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:57.830\nLet me see if my laptop has hit it.\n\n542\n00:25:57.830 --> 00:26:01.500\nThere was a bug in the earliest versions\nof El Capitan, where your machine would\n\n543\n00:26:01.500 --> 00:26:06.900\nboot up, and like, my machine is\ncalled I think DPLAPTOP-OSX, right?\n\n544\n00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:11.930\nSo if I go into my System Preferences,\nand I go into\n\n545\n00:26:11.930 --> 00:26:16.960\nSharing, so I'm in my System Preferences,\nand I'm gonna go into Sharing.\n\n546\n00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:20.000\nSo right here,\nyou can see the name on my laptop, okay?\n\n547\n00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:23.400\nIf there was another machine on\nthe network with the same name,\n\n548\n00:26:24.410 --> 00:26:29.030\nthe second device to come up\nwould rename itself like that.\n\n549\n00:26:29.030 --> 00:26:31.610\nAnd you might have seen this where\nthere's a parentheses and a one.\n\n550\n00:26:31.610 --> 00:26:35.590\nAnd there was a bug in the earlier\nversions of El Capitan, where\n\n551\n00:26:35.590 --> 00:26:39.240\nlike your laptop would see itself, thanks\nto some DNS caching that was going on.\n\n552\n00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:42.370\nAnd so my laptop was\nincrementing like once a week.\n\n553\n00:26:42.370 --> 00:26:44.880\nAnd I remember right before\nI applied the last bug fix,\n\n554\n00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:51.110\nI was at like DPLAPTOP-OSX 12, like it\nrenamed itself that many times as it went.\n\n555\n00:26:51.110 --> 00:26:51.804\nSo that'll happen.\n\n556\n00:26:51.804 --> 00:26:55.307\nSo the reality is you can do an exact\nbit for bit clone for a machine and\n\n557\n00:26:55.307 --> 00:26:58.212\nroll it out 1,000 times,\nand it doesn't matter.\n\n558\n00:26:58.212 --> 00:27:00.240\nBut in the net restore wizard,\n\n559\n00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:04.144\nwe had that option to randomize\nthe computer name, right.\n\n560\n00:27:04.144 --> 00:27:07.260\nAnd I turned that on, I gave it a little\nprefix and the rest of it's randomized.\n\n561\n00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:10.290\nSo the one thing that can cause\na problem is already taken care for\n\n562\n00:27:10.290 --> 00:27:10.834\nus in the wizard.\n\n563\n00:27:10.834 --> 00:27:13.130\nYep, so that definitely makes life easy.\n\n564\n00:27:13.130 --> 00:27:16.000\nIt also makes life easier on like\nsoftware activations and stuff.\n\n565\n00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.660\nBecause in the Windows world,\nwhen you run the Sysprep,\n\n566\n00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:21.630\nall your software deactivates, and\nyou've gotta deal with all the licensing.\n\n567\n00:27:21.630 --> 00:27:22.510\nHere, we don't, right?\n\n568\n00:27:22.510 --> 00:27:23.990\nIt's just that same machine.\n\n569\n00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:28.630\nAll right, so that restore image\nis running in the background.\n\n570\n00:27:28.630 --> 00:27:32.730\nAnd one thing you guys might notice\nis that it's taking a lot longer\n\n571\n00:27:32.730 --> 00:27:33.780\nthan NetInstall did.\n\n572\n00:27:33.780 --> 00:27:36.290\nRemember when we did NetInstall,\nit went really fast.\n\n573\n00:27:36.290 --> 00:27:37.350\nWhy was that?\n\n574\n00:27:37.350 --> 00:27:41.650\nWell, it had the El Capitan installer,\nand that's what it uses as source, so\n\n575\n00:27:41.650 --> 00:27:43.870\nit already had the source built.\n\n576\n00:27:43.870 --> 00:27:46.790\nAnd it just needed to stick our automator\nstuff on there, and it was done.\n\n577\n00:27:46.790 --> 00:27:50.370\nBut here,\nit's gonna read that entire hard drive.\n\n578\n00:27:50.370 --> 00:27:54.420\nIt's gonna read all that data and\nbring it over and that takes longer.\n\n579\n00:27:54.420 --> 00:27:56.530\nAnd so it's gonna churn along and\ndo that, and\n\n580\n00:27:56.530 --> 00:27:59.950\nwhen it's done,\nwe're going to have a net restore image.\n\n581\n00:27:59.950 --> 00:28:03.000\nAnd the image itself really doesn't\nlook much different than the image\n\n582\n00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:04.820\nthat we did for net install earlier,\n\n583\n00:28:04.820 --> 00:28:07.290\nthe difference here being that it's\njust got a lot of customizations in it.\n\n584\n00:28:07.290 --> 00:28:08.720\nIt's got a full install.\n\n585\n00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:10.910\nAnd that's really\nthe power of net restore.\n\n586\n00:28:10.910 --> 00:28:11.590\n>> Very good.\n\n587\n00:28:11.590 --> 00:28:14.380\nSo in this episode,\nwe've been looking at net restore and\n\n588\n00:28:14.380 --> 00:28:18.910\nhow you can use it to apply an image to\nyour machine, or well, 1,000 machines,\n\n589\n00:28:18.910 --> 00:28:20.730\ndepending on what your\ndeployment might be.\n\n590\n00:28:20.730 --> 00:28:22.840\nDon, have anything else for\nus in this episode?\n\n591\n00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:24.850\n>> Just a comment about\nthe source machine.\n\n592\n00:28:24.850 --> 00:28:27.720\nThat when we're done, we've got the image,\nwe're ready to go and\n\n593\n00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:29.440\ndeploy, what do we do\nwith the source machine?\n\n594\n00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:32.460\nWell, you can boot it back up and\nit's already got the image on it,\n\n595\n00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:33.850\ncuz we used it as the source.\n\n596\n00:28:33.850 --> 00:28:35.310\nSo you can then turn it\nloose to the wild and\n\n597\n00:28:35.310 --> 00:28:36.337\ndistribute it with your other machines.\n\n598\n00:28:36.337 --> 00:28:39.930\nOr you could set it aside,\nand you could say,\n\n599\n00:28:39.930 --> 00:28:42.886\nhey, this is my dedicated source machine.\n\n600\n00:28:42.886 --> 00:28:45.520\nAnd that's kind of useful cuz\nthere's one thing that I like to do,\n\n601\n00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:48.940\nwhich is if you have a dedicated\nsource machine, once a week,\n\n602\n00:28:48.940 --> 00:28:51.420\nyou can log into it and\napply all the updates, right.\n\n603\n00:28:51.420 --> 00:28:55.845\nApply the app store updates, just the\noperating system updates that come out,\n\n604\n00:28:55.845 --> 00:28:59.495\nany software updates for\nother applications you gotta install.\n\n605\n00:28:59.495 --> 00:29:00.640\nYou can just update it.\n\n606\n00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:03.060\nAnd then take a new image and\nwe take a new image you updated so\n\n607\n00:29:03.060 --> 00:29:05.900\nthat you always know when you're deploying\nthat image, it's the most recent.\n\n608\n00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:09.020\nSo if you have a dedicated source machine,\n\n609\n00:29:09.020 --> 00:29:12.410\nit makes it easier to do the continual\nmanagement of net restorer.\n\n610\n00:29:12.410 --> 00:29:16.377\nIf I send this net restorer machine out,\nthis is the source machine out to whoever,\n\n611\n00:29:16.377 --> 00:29:20.001\nany end user to use it, any time I want\nto update the image, I've got to go and\n\n612\n00:29:20.001 --> 00:29:20.814\nget a computer.\n\n613\n00:29:20.814 --> 00:29:24.510\nI've got to deploy the net restore\nimage that I made, update it, and\n\n614\n00:29:24.510 --> 00:29:27.360\ntake the image, so\nit's extra steps involved.\n\n615\n00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:31.230\nSo if you can keep your source machine\nas dedicated, that makes sense.\n\n616\n00:29:31.230 --> 00:29:33.030\nBut if you're on a shoestring budget,\n\n617\n00:29:33.030 --> 00:29:36.680\nhaving a machine sitting there doing\nnothing most of the time is not great.\n\n618\n00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:39.630\nSo, that may not be an option,\nand you would just have to go and\n\n619\n00:29:39.630 --> 00:29:42.470\nredeploy the net restore image to\nmake your changes and reimage it.\n\n620\n00:29:42.470 --> 00:29:44.450\nSo, yeah, a little extra headache there.\n\n621\n00:29:44.450 --> 00:29:45.790\n>> All right, Don, great information.\n\n622\n00:29:45.790 --> 00:29:50.160\nWe've got a lot more good information\nto come in our Mac Management Basics.\n\n623\n00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:53.000\nBut looks like we're coming to the end\nof this one, so we're gonna go ahead and\n\n624\n00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:54.440\nsign out for ITProTV.\n\n625\n00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:56.210\nI've been your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n626\n00:29:56.210 --> 00:29:56.734\n>> And I'm Don Pizet.\n\n627\n00:29:56.734 --> 00:29:57.960\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n628\n00:29:57.960 --> 00:30:06.490\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:16.403\nI'm your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n4\n00:00:16.403 --> 00:00:17.591\nAnd in today's episode,\n\n5\n00:00:17.591 --> 00:00:20.645\nwere gonna be continuing along\nin our Mac management basics.\n\n6\n00:00:20.645 --> 00:00:24.245\nAnd joining me in the studio today is\na man that makes the geniuses look\n\n7\n00:00:24.245 --> 00:00:24.895\nlike fools.\n\n8\n00:00:24.895 --> 00:00:26.038\nYes, that's Don Pezet.\n\n9\n00:00:26.038 --> 00:00:27.177\nHow are you doing, Don?\n\n10\n00:00:27.177 --> 00:00:29.105\n>> Why do you gotta build me\nup on such a pedestal, Wes?\n\n11\n00:00:29.105 --> 00:00:30.295\nNow I get to disappoint for 30 minutes.\n\n12\n00:00:30.295 --> 00:00:33.117\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, I am glad to be back though.\n\n13\n00:00:33.117 --> 00:00:36.730\nWe're gonna jump right back\ninto Mac management basics.\n\n14\n00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:41.800\nAnd I know some of you out there\nare saying, all right, this Don guy,\n\n15\n00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.040\nhe showed us how to do a lot of stuff.\n\n16\n00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.330\nThe last three episodes\nwe built a lot of images.\n\n17\n00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:47.040\nBut what have we done with those images?\n\n18\n00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:48.450\nWhat have those images done for us lately?\n\n19\n00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:49.450\nAnd the answer is nothing, right?\n\n20\n00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:51.840\nWe haven't used the images at all.\n\n21\n00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.230\nAnd so, in our next two episodes what\nwe're gonna do is we're gonna focus on\n\n22\n00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.100\nusing those images,\ndeploying them back out.\n\n23\n00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.468\nAnd when it comes to deploying NetInstall,\nNetRestore restore, even NetBoot, well,\n\n24\n00:01:02.468 --> 00:01:04.227\nI guess to a lesser extent NetBoot.\n\n25\n00:01:04.227 --> 00:01:08.520\nWith NetInstall and NetRestore,\nthere's two ways to really deploy them.\n\n26\n00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.890\nThere's via removable media,\nor via the network.\n\n27\n00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:14.730\nNow, via the network, that's the way that\nyou really wanna do it in a business or\n\n28\n00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:15.750\ncorporate environment.\n\n29\n00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.110\nBut sometimes you don't have\nthe infrastructure in place.\n\n30\n00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:20.990\nAnd so, removable media is\nanother great way to do it.\n\n31\n00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.950\nSo, we've got both options.\n\n32\n00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.310\nAnd when I say removable media,\nit's not just any old media.\n\n33\n00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.010\nYou used to be able to get\nDVDs to install and so on.\n\n34\n00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:29.720\nNow, it's pretty much just USB keys.\n\n35\n00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.420\nSo, if you have a USB key, or\na USB hard drive of some sort,\n\n36\n00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.360\nyou can use that to boot your system and\ndo an install off of it and go from there.\n\n37\n00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.150\nSo, the one that doesn't quite\nwork with both is NetBoot.\n\n38\n00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.320\nBecause NetBoot, by definition you're\nsupposed to be booting your computer from\n\n39\n00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:50.340\nthe network, not booting from\na USB key attached to your system.\n\n40\n00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.180\nBut there is actually a way to get\nNetBoot to work from a USB key,\n\n41\n00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.390\nit just kind of defeats\nthe whole purpose of it, right?\n\n42\n00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:00.080\nSo, when we go to a Mac and we wanna\ndeploy an image, we've got choices.\n\n43\n00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.200\nAnd the reality is you'll probably\nuse both, a mixture of both.\n\n44\n00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.170\nYou'll use the network when\nit's available, but if for\n\n45\n00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:06.730\nsome reason the network isn't available,\n\n46\n00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:09.310\nyou'll want USB keys available too,\nall right?\n\n47\n00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.020\nSo, in this episode we're gonna\ntackle that USB side of things.\n\n48\n00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:16.990\nSo, let's say that I need to deploy\nEl Capitan out to my systems and\n\n49\n00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:18.890\nI wanna do it with a USB key.\n\n50\n00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.730\nOkay, well, in our NetInstall episodes,\n\n51\n00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.280\nwe built some images for\ninstalling El Capitan.\n\n52\n00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.450\nAnd we built one that was just\na stock image of El Capitan.\n\n53\n00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.660\nAnd then,\nwe built one that was customized,\n\n54\n00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.600\nthat had a lot of modifications to it.\n\n55\n00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:33.710\nRight?\n\n56\n00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:35.590\nAnd, I say a lot,\nI don't think we customized all that much,\n\n57\n00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.740\njust power settings and\na few other things.\n\n58\n00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.970\nBut if I wanna deploy those out,\nthey actually deployed very similarly.\n\n59\n00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.420\nIn fact, if you wanna deploy a stock\nversion of El Capitan via USB,\n\n60\n00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.690\nI usually don't even bother\nbuilding a NetInstall image\n\n61\n00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.130\nbecause the El Capitan installer can\nactually create that USB key for us.\n\n62\n00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.640\nAll right?\n\n63\n00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.770\nSo, I wanna show you guys how to do that,\nand we'll just start with the stock one.\n\n64\n00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:59.590\nAnd then, we'll take our customized one,\nwe'll build a USB key for\n\n65\n00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:00.810\nthat one too, all right?\n\n66\n00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.100\nSo, let's start with the stock one.\n\n67\n00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.970\nThe first thing that we're\ngonna need is a USB key, right?\n\n68\n00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:06.440\nA little bit of USB storage.\n\n69\n00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:07.610\nIt could be a hard drive.\n\n70\n00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:10.500\nI've got both, I've got a hard\ndrive here and I've got a USB key.\n\n71\n00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:16.310\nBut all you really need if you wanna do\na stock install of El Capitan is just\n\n72\n00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:22.430\na eight gig USB key, which you can pick\nup for $5 or $10 on Amazon pretty easy.\n\n73\n00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:23.640\nSo, they're not expensive.\n\n74\n00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.040\nBut it does need to be 8 gigabyte.\n\n75\n00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.220\n4 gigabyte is not going to be enough.\n\n76\n00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:30.680\nThe other thing you need is\nthe El Capitan installer.\n\n77\n00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.440\nSo, if you haven't downloaded\nthe El Capitan installer,\n\n78\n00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.180\nwe covered it in another episode,\nyou are gonna need it here.\n\n79\n00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.730\nAnd so, you can see on mine where I've got\nthat Install OS X El Capitan right there.\n\n80\n00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:42.030\nSo, I can build my installer.\n\n81\n00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.262\nI could build Yosemite also.\n\n82\n00:03:43.262 --> 00:03:44.467\nI still have that one laying around.\n\n83\n00:03:44.467 --> 00:03:47.140\nBut El Capitan is the one that I want,\nright?\n\n84\n00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:50.410\nNow, to build it,\nwe are gonna have to drop to our terminal.\n\n85\n00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.150\nAnd the first thing we need to\ndo is we need to make sure that\n\n86\n00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:57.700\nour USB key is plugged in and that we\ndon't care about the data that's on it\n\n87\n00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:00.650\nbecause it's gonna have to be\nformatted as we build this image.\n\n88\n00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:04.300\nSo, I've got a USB key plugged and it's\njust showing up over here as untitled.\n\n89\n00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:06.400\nAnd so,\nI know it doesn't have any data on it.\n\n90\n00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.270\nBut just to be sure, I could go\ninto disc utility and format it.\n\n91\n00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:12.820\nTechnically, you don't have to do this,\nyou don't have to format it,\n\n92\n00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:14.770\nthe creator will format it for us.\n\n93\n00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:18.470\nBut you can jump in and find your\nmemory and just erase it real quick.\n\n94\n00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:19.890\nYou can name it whatever you want.\n\n95\n00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:23.180\nIt does need to have a name cuz we're\ngonna need it in the command line.\n\n96\n00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:27.460\nBut I'll leave mine untitled, or a lot\nof times you see no name, or whatever.\n\n97\n00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.610\nThe name doesn't matter,\nwe just need to know the name.\n\n98\n00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:35.250\nAnd I'll do OS X Extended Journal to\nstart kinda default format there.\n\n99\n00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:38.030\nSo, I'm just gonna format that disk real\nquick to make sure I don't have any data\n\n100\n00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:39.190\non it and it's ready to go.\n\n101\n00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:43.550\nAll right, from there I'm gonna\njump back to my terminal.\n\n102\n00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:46.760\nAnd now, we can start to\nbuild that installer image.\n\n103\n00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:50.230\nNow, there's the command that\nshows up on the exam, and\n\n104\n00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:51.660\nthere's a command used in real life.\n\n105\n00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:54.080\nSo, let me show you the command\nthat's on the exam first.\n\n106\n00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.890\nAnd then,\nI'll show you the one that you really use.\n\n107\n00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:58.630\nSo, the command they want you to\nremember for the exam is this.\n\n108\n00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:00.368\nYou need run the Yosemite install,\n\n109\n00:05:00.368 --> 00:05:05.260\nthe El Capitan install, whatever install\nit is you're building USB key for.\n\n110\n00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:09.370\nThis is an El Capitan show, so\nI should probably do that one.\n\n111\n00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:15.550\nSo, I'm gonna do /Applications/Install\n\\ OS\\ X\\ El\\ Capitan.app/.\n\n112\n00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:19.310\nAnd I'm using the tab autocomplete here\nin Terminal because it saves you so\n\n113\n00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:20.250\nmuch time.\n\n114\n00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:22.960\nBecause every time you have\na space in a filename,\n\n115\n00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.600\nyou have to escape it with a backslash,\nright?\n\n116\n00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.150\nAnd so, by using tab auto-complete,\nit's doing that for me.\n\n117\n00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:31.080\nYou just start to type it and\nhit tab, and it finishes it out.\n\n118\n00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:34.620\nSo, I'm calling the application\nslash applications\n\n119\n00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:38.000\nslash install OS X El Capitan dot app.\n\n120\n00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:38.810\nRight?\n\n121\n00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:43.330\nBut, I don't want to run the installer cuz\nthat would install it here on my laptop.\n\n122\n00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:47.590\nI wanna run a program that's\ninside of the installer.\n\n123\n00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:52.380\nInside of that installer is a little\nprogram called createinstallmedia, and\n\n124\n00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:53.950\nthat's exactly what I wanna call.\n\n125\n00:05:53.950 --> 00:06:00.940\nSo, I'm gonna say\n/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia,\n\n126\n00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:03.450\nand it's gonna screen wrap on\nme cuz it's just a long command.\n\n127\n00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:10.430\nBut createinstallmedia, that utility\nIs inside of the El Capitan installer.\n\n128\n00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:12.130\nI can't browse to it.\n\n129\n00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:15.320\nYou can browse to it graphically if you\nwant, but you can't run it graphically.\n\n130\n00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:16.422\nYou gotta run it from the terminal.\n\n131\n00:06:16.422 --> 00:06:18.670\nAll right?\nThis is the command that will show\n\n132\n00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:19.290\nup on the exam.\n\n133\n00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:21.450\nJust this part right here, okay?\n\n134\n00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:22.560\nBut in real life land,\n\n135\n00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:25.700\nif you run this, it's gonna start\nasking you a bunch of questions.\n\n136\n00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:27.900\nThere's a lot more\ninformation that it needs.\n\n137\n00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:30.190\nAnd so, I could run this, and\nit would just start to prompt me for\n\n138\n00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:31.700\nthose other things, right?\n\n139\n00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:35.300\nAnd, yeah, so, here, it's actually warning\nme, even, that I'm not running as root,\n\n140\n00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:37.270\nI'm not running with\nadministrative privileges.\n\n141\n00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:41.300\nAnd it's telling me, hey, you forgot to\ntell me what volume to install from, and\n\n142\n00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:44.690\nwhere my application is, and\nall this other stuff, right?\n\n143\n00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:47.230\nSo, while this is the command\nwe need to remember for\n\n144\n00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:51.680\nthe exam, the command we run in real life\nwill be a little bit different, all right?\n\n145\n00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:53.900\nFirst off,\nI need to run it as an administrator.\n\n146\n00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:58.390\nSo, I'm gonna add sudo\nto the beginning sudo.\n\n147\n00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:01.350\nOkay, that's super user do.\n\n148\n00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:04.510\nRun this is the super user,\nrun on this root, all right?\n\n149\n00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:07.430\nAnd then, the command that\nApple wants us to remember.\n\n150\n00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:10.610\nAnd then, I'm gonna provide it\nwith some additional data, right?\n\n151\n00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:13.000\nI need to tell it where my USB key is.\n\n152\n00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:18.170\nSo, I'm gonna say --volume,\nand point it to that USB key,\n\n153\n00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:22.800\nwhich is /volumes/ and\nwhatever the name of your USB key is.\n\n154\n00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:24.390\nRemember, I said you need\nto remember the name.\n\n155\n00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:25.420\nHere's where I need it.\n\n156\n00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:28.140\nMine's just called Untitled, okay?\n\n157\n00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:31.453\nSo, I'm gonna point it\nto /Volumes/Untitled.\n\n158\n00:07:31.453 --> 00:07:40.030\nAnd then, I need to do --applicationpath\nto tell it where the installer is.\n\n159\n00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:41.250\nAnd I know this is kind of silly.\n\n160\n00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:44.160\nWhy do I have to tell it where\nthe installer is if it's inside of\n\n161\n00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:44.910\nthe installer?\n\n162\n00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:47.200\nBut it makes you do it anyway, right?\n\n163\n00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:48.587\nYou gotta tell it where to pull it from.\n\n164\n00:07:48.587 --> 00:07:57.338\nSo, I need to point to \\ Applications\n\\Install\\OS\\X\\ El\\ Capitan.app, right?\n\n165\n00:07:57.338 --> 00:08:00.379\nSo, I need to point to That application,\nright?\n\n166\n00:08:00.379 --> 00:08:03.337\nI'm just gonna get rid of that little\nbackslash, you don't need that.\n\n167\n00:08:03.337 --> 00:08:05.353\nTechnically, this is all we need but\n\n168\n00:08:05.353 --> 00:08:08.960\nmost people will add one more\nthing which is --nointeraction.\n\n169\n00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:10.940\nIn other words,\ndon't wanna ask me any questions,\n\n170\n00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:13.360\ndon't ask me if it's okay to\noverwrite the disk or whatever.\n\n171\n00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:15.180\nJust do it and leave me be, right?\n\n172\n00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:16.720\nSo, I'm gonna add that onto the end.\n\n173\n00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:20.450\nSo, the command for\nthe exam was pretty short, right?\n\n174\n00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:26.200\nIt was just slash application, slash\ninstall, slash OS X El Capitan dot app,\n\n175\n00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:29.680\nslash content, slash resources,\nslash create install media.\n\n176\n00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:30.605\nIt's short, right?\n\n177\n00:08:30.605 --> 00:08:32.590\n[LAUGH]\n>> That's a great command.\n\n178\n00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:36.160\n>> But the command in real life is going\nto be longer, because we have to specify\n\n179\n00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:39.770\nthe volume to overwrite, where application\nis, and tell it not to do interaction.\n\n180\n00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:41.500\nSo, it's a bit more to it.\n\n181\n00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:44.460\nBut when I run that,\nassuming I didn't type it wrong.\n\n182\n00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:46.830\nWell, I have to give it my password here,\n\n183\n00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:49.840\nthen what it's going to do is it's\ngoing to start by erasing the disks.\n\n184\n00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:50.480\nSo there it goes.\n\n185\n00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:52.680\nIt just formatted my USB key.\n\n186\n00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:55.180\nRemember when I said you\ndidn't have to format it?\n\n187\n00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:57.560\nI did it just because I wanted\nto make sure it was empty.\n\n188\n00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:01.470\nAnd then, now it's copying\nthe installer files to the disk.\n\n189\n00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:06.180\nSo it's getting ready to move\nthose installer files over and\n\n190\n00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:07.350\nget that disk set up.\n\n191\n00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:11.710\nNow, it's doing more than just copying the\ninstaller files, cuz you could do that,\n\n192\n00:09:11.710 --> 00:09:14.090\nyou can copy the files over,\nit's no big deal.\n\n193\n00:09:14.090 --> 00:09:19.030\nThe extra thing that it's doing is\nwhat's called blessing the disk.\n\n194\n00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:22.160\nIt's getting it ready so\nthat the disk will be bootable, right?\n\n195\n00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:25.240\nMaking that USB key bootable\nis kind of an important thing.\n\n196\n00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:27.600\nIf I just copy the install files\nto the disk, I can't boot off it.\n\n197\n00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:31.020\nI've got to bless it first, so\nthat's what's gonna happen here.\n\n198\n00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:34.790\nIt's taken care of all that for\nme, and it's copying it.\n\n199\n00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:39.015\nNow, depending on the speed of your USB\nkey, this can be fast, this can be slow.\n\n200\n00:09:39.015 --> 00:09:42.990\nIt's gonna copy about six\ngigabytes of data to your USB key.\n\n201\n00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:47.920\nAnd if you have a USB 2.0 key,\nwell, you go get some coffee,\n\n202\n00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:50.160\ntake a lunch break,\nit will take an hour, right?\n\n203\n00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:52.950\nBut if you're on USB 3.0, usually it\nonly takes a couple of minutes and\n\n204\n00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:54.630\nthen it'll finish, all right?\n\n205\n00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:57.950\nBut while we're waiting on that, because\nI'm impatient and I don't wanna wait.\n\n206\n00:09:57.950 --> 00:10:02.290\nWhile we're waiting on that, we can\ntake a look at how to build this image,\n\n207\n00:10:02.290 --> 00:10:08.140\nnot with a El Capitan installer,\nbut with our own installer.\n\n208\n00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:11.740\nSo what if I made a customized\nnet install image?\n\n209\n00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:13.830\nOr what if I made a net restore image?\n\n210\n00:10:13.830 --> 00:10:15.390\nNot net install, but net restore, right?\n\n211\n00:10:15.390 --> 00:10:17.760\nI've got a clone of a computer.\n\n212\n00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:21.570\nIf I wanna do that,\nI can deploy those with USB keys also.\n\n213\n00:10:21.570 --> 00:10:23.730\nMy first challenge is simply\ngoing to be the size, though.\n\n214\n00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:25.840\nI've gotta make sure the USB\nkey is the right size.\n\n215\n00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:28.260\nAnd once you started\ncustomizing the installer,\n\n216\n00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:29.920\nyou don't necessarily\nknow the size any more.\n\n217\n00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:31.450\nYours can be very, very large.\n\n218\n00:10:31.450 --> 00:10:36.370\nSo you may not be able to buy a USB device\nthat's big enough to store your image.\n\n219\n00:10:36.370 --> 00:10:38.610\nYou probably can, right, but\nit might not be a USB key.\n\n220\n00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:40.620\nYou may have to go to\nan actual USB hard drive.\n\n221\n00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:44.460\nSo I've got a 128 gig USB hard drive\nhere attached that I could use.\n\n222\n00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:47.600\nBut you can get terabyte, two terabyte,\nfour terabyte drives if you need to.\n\n223\n00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:48.470\nSo you can really go crazy.\n\n224\n00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:54.020\nThen, once we know the size,\nwe can get ready to build the disk.\n\n225\n00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:55.800\nSo let me walk you through that process.\n\n226\n00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:57.650\nSo the first thing that\nI wanna verify my size.\n\n227\n00:10:57.650 --> 00:11:00.740\nSo I'm gonna browse to\nwhere my images are and\n\n228\n00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:03.490\nthese are all the images that we\nmade in our previous shows, right?\n\n229\n00:11:03.490 --> 00:11:10.170\nSo we had a NetInstall of OS X El Capitan,\njust straight up, not modified.\n\n230\n00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:13.100\nWe had one that was customized,\nwhere I added VirtualBox to it and\n\n231\n00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:15.030\nI added a few other little things.\n\n232\n00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:19.410\nThis is just a package of VirtualBox by\nitself, that's not an actual disk image so\n\n233\n00:11:19.410 --> 00:11:20.650\nI wouldn't deploy that.\n\n234\n00:11:20.650 --> 00:11:24.440\nAnd then I've got a NetRestore\nwe made of a Mac Mini.\n\n235\n00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:28.280\nAnd remember when I did it, it said\nthe hard drive of that Mac Mini had 15 and\n\n236\n00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:30.420\na half gigs of data on it.\n\n237\n00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:33.990\nWell, when I built the image,\nit probably compressed it, so\n\n238\n00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:35.360\nI expect it to be a little smaller.\n\n239\n00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:38.660\nBut let's see what it actually\nended up being size wise.\n\n240\n00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:40.325\nAnd sure enough.\n\n241\n00:11:40.325 --> 00:11:42.850\n9.3 gigs, so significantly smaller.\n\n242\n00:11:42.850 --> 00:11:44.820\nIt'll fit on my 16 gig USB key just fine.\n\n243\n00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:50.490\nI was a little worried because at 15 and\na half gigs, my USB key's only 16 gigs.\n\n244\n00:11:50.490 --> 00:11:52.140\nThat's really tight.\n\n245\n00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:54.650\nWhen you start throwing\na recovery partition or whatever,\n\n246\n00:11:54.650 --> 00:11:56.900\nyou'll break that 16 gigs\nis not enough anymore.\n\n247\n00:11:56.900 --> 00:11:58.420\nBut in my case it will fit.\n\n248\n00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:01.470\nAll right, so\nif I wanna make a USB installer for\n\n249\n00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:04.420\none of my images,\nit's actually really easy.\n\n250\n00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:08.400\nCuz all you have to do is take\nyour USB key and format it, right?\n\n251\n00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:11.350\nFormat it as OS X Extended Journaled.\n\n252\n00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:14.200\nSo we want it to be that\nextended partition type.\n\n253\n00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:18.200\nAnd then copy your NetInstall or\nNetResource folder over to it.\n\n254\n00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:21.400\nJust take this folder,\nthe folder that ends in .nbi.\n\n255\n00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:22.910\nRight, that's NetBoot image.\n\n256\n00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:27.130\nWe're gonna take that folder and\njust copy it to the USB key.\n\n257\n00:12:27.130 --> 00:12:30.770\nAnd once that's done, I've now got a USB\nkey with my installation media on it.\n\n258\n00:12:30.770 --> 00:12:35.260\nBut it's not blessed, right,\nI can't actually boot off of it.\n\n259\n00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:39.820\nSo to actually make it bootable, we're\ngonna have to get the automator involved.\n\n260\n00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:44.410\nOkay, and if you fire up your automator,\nso I'm gonna fire up the automator.\n\n261\n00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:50.140\nAnd I'm just gonna come in here and we'll\ncreate a new document in the automator.\n\n262\n00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:54.840\nAnd we're gonna see an automator\nworkflow pop up here just like we saw in\n\n263\n00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:57.960\nthe earlier episodes when we were\ndoing NetInstall and those other guys.\n\n264\n00:12:57.960 --> 00:12:59.360\nI'm gonna do a workflow.\n\n265\n00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:00.680\nSo I'll just leave that one selected.\n\n266\n00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:01.560\nThat's my default.\n\n267\n00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:03.080\nSo I'll chose that.\n\n268\n00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:05.340\nAnd now I can start to build a workflow.\n\n269\n00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:08.380\nAnd the workflow that I need to\nbuild here is really simple.\n\n270\n00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:11.728\nOn the left side, if I go down to system,\n\n271\n00:13:11.728 --> 00:13:16.550\nthere's a system called\nBless NetBoot Image Folder.\n\n272\n00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:19.280\nOr Bless NetBoot Server,\nwe're not gonna mess with that here.\n\n273\n00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:21.140\nBut Bless the NetBoot Image Folder.\n\n274\n00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:24.870\nAnd what this is gonna do is I can take\nthat USB key that I just copied my NBI\n\n275\n00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:28.770\nfolder over to, and I can bless it and\nmake it bootable, right?\n\n276\n00:13:28.770 --> 00:13:31.550\nThat's really important cuz\nit's not bootable otherwise.\n\n277\n00:13:31.550 --> 00:13:33.440\nAnd so by doing that,\n\n278\n00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:36.790\nit's gonna make sure that it\nactually does what I need it to do.\n\n279\n00:13:36.790 --> 00:13:40.370\nAnd you'll see here we can give it\na custom label, apply a custom icon.\n\n280\n00:13:40.370 --> 00:13:42.150\nYou can do all that crazy stuff to it.\n\n281\n00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:44.680\nBut the important part is that\nwe need to choose a folder.\n\n282\n00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:48.510\nNow mine is actually kinda broken\nhere cuz I skipped the step that\n\n283\n00:13:48.510 --> 00:13:52.630\nthe first thing I need to do is\nI need to get the folder itself.\n\n284\n00:13:52.630 --> 00:13:54.910\nSo here it doesn't actually\nhave anything to Bless.\n\n285\n00:13:54.910 --> 00:13:58.570\nSo on the left side if I go back\nunder Utilities, I think it's, no,\n\n286\n00:13:58.570 --> 00:14:00.290\nno actually it's Files & Folders.\n\n287\n00:14:00.290 --> 00:14:05.230\nIf I go to Files & Folders,\nyou'll see there is Get Folder Contents,\n\n288\n00:14:05.230 --> 00:14:08.680\nand Get Specified Finder items, and so on.\n\n289\n00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:12.500\nThe one I want is\nGet Specified Finder Items, specified,\n\n290\n00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:15.880\nthere we go, not selected, and\nI'm gonna throw that into my workflow.\n\n291\n00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:17.810\nNow I do have a slight problem\ncuz I got these backwards, so\n\n292\n00:14:17.810 --> 00:14:20.420\nI need to kinda rearrange a little bit.\n\n293\n00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:22.980\nAnd, whoops, I guess I did.\n\n294\n00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:24.109\nCome on.\nYou want to rearrange.\n\n295\n00:14:24.109 --> 00:14:26.730\nYou want to participate.\n\n296\n00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:27.560\nThere we go, perfect [LAUGH].\n\n297\n00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:30.145\nSo, if we can get\nthe automator to play nice,\n\n298\n00:14:30.145 --> 00:14:34.475\nwhat you want is Get Specified Finder\nItems to be your first workflow item.\n\n299\n00:14:34.475 --> 00:14:37.450\nOkay, and here is where we can\n\n300\n00:14:37.450 --> 00:14:41.600\nadd that nbi folder that we've\ncopied over to the key, okay.\n\n301\n00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:46.690\nAnd once we've got that, then it\ncan Bless the NetBoot Image Folder.\n\n302\n00:14:46.690 --> 00:14:49.230\nAnd it'll know what to bless because\nit already got it right here.\n\n303\n00:14:49.230 --> 00:14:51.600\nIt gets the folder and then it blesses it.\n\n304\n00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:53.060\nI don't have to give it a custom label.\n\n305\n00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:54.420\nI don't have to give it a custom icon.\n\n306\n00:14:54.420 --> 00:14:56.050\nI don't have to mess with those at all.\n\n307\n00:14:56.050 --> 00:14:58.330\nI just need to add the folder right here.\n\n308\n00:14:58.330 --> 00:14:59.770\nAnd then when I run this,\n\n309\n00:14:59.770 --> 00:15:02.830\nby using that run button up there,\nit'll bless that folder.\n\n310\n00:15:02.830 --> 00:15:06.650\nAnd I've now made a USB key\nthat can do that, all right?\n\n311\n00:15:06.650 --> 00:15:09.520\nNow, what I'm doing now is kinda\nstalling a little bit to see if\n\n312\n00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:10.390\nthis other one finishes.\n\n313\n00:15:10.390 --> 00:15:11.030\nThere we go.\n\n314\n00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:12.090\nIt finished.\n\n315\n00:15:12.090 --> 00:15:14.580\nAnd so I can see right here\nthat it finished building up\n\n316\n00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:18.200\nthat OS X installer for\nthat stock install, and\n\n317\n00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:21.260\nthat one's ready to go, built right\noff of the El Capitan installer.\n\n318\n00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:23.633\nI've now got a USB media that'll do that,\nand in fact,\n\n319\n00:15:23.633 --> 00:15:25.109\nI should see that on my hard drive.\n\n320\n00:15:26.693 --> 00:15:30.576\nRight here you can see I have a USB\nkey mounted that's showing us\n\n321\n00:15:30.576 --> 00:15:32.130\nInstall OS X El Capitan.\n\n322\n00:15:32.130 --> 00:15:36.190\nThat's that default installer,\nand if I take this USB key and\n\n323\n00:15:36.190 --> 00:15:42.070\nplug it into one of my Macs,\nI can boot up off the USB key and\n\n324\n00:15:42.070 --> 00:15:44.820\nIt's going to install OSX.\n\n325\n00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:46.720\nRight, and it's gonna install\nusing the default installer.\n\n326\n00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:49.836\nSo, users are gonna have questions,\nthey're gonna have to answer them,\n\n327\n00:15:49.836 --> 00:15:51.921\nthey're gonna pick the hard\ndrive to install to.\n\n328\n00:15:51.921 --> 00:15:54.962\nThey're gonna have to choose whether or\nnot they wanna sign into iCloud.\n\n329\n00:15:54.962 --> 00:15:55.881\nThey'll have to do all that stuff.\n\n330\n00:15:55.881 --> 00:15:57.754\nIt's not automated, right?\n\n331\n00:15:57.754 --> 00:16:02.046\nIf I wanted to be automated, that's what\nI've got to use my installers, okay.\n\n332\n00:16:02.046 --> 00:16:05.900\nSo, let's say that we wanna build one\nof those, it's our own installer.\n\n333\n00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:07.720\nI'm gonna fire up the Disk Utility.\n\n334\n00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:11.610\nAnd I'm gonna take that nice USB\ninstaller that we just made,\n\n335\n00:16:11.610 --> 00:16:14.410\nthat was built off of the default\nEl Capitan installer, right.\n\n336\n00:16:14.410 --> 00:16:17.950\nAnd I'm gonna format it, cuz a job\nworth doing is worth doing twice.\n\n337\n00:16:17.950 --> 00:16:20.400\nSo I'm gonna erase that one,\nand I'm gonna call this my,\n\n338\n00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:27.325\nactually it would be NetRestore,\nthis would be a NetRestore disk, okay.\n\n339\n00:16:27.325 --> 00:16:33.990\nOr I might call this my\nLab Mac Mini Restore.\n\n340\n00:16:33.990 --> 00:16:36.420\nSo I'm gonna put that\nLab Mac Mini NetRestore on here.\n\n341\n00:16:36.420 --> 00:16:38.440\nI could do one of our other\ninstallers if I wanted,\n\n342\n00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:40.840\nany of the NetInstalls or\nNetRestores will work.\n\n343\n00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:42.480\nSo I'm gonna do the NetRestore one and\n\n344\n00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:47.190\nI'll format it as\nOS X Extended [Journaled].\n\n345\n00:16:47.190 --> 00:16:52.040\nAnd then once it's formatted,\nI'm gonna take that image that we've got,\n\n346\n00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:54.580\nthat image we made in the last episode.\n\n347\n00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:57.050\nSo I'll browse into my drive and find it.\n\n348\n00:16:57.050 --> 00:16:58.203\nSo this guy right here,\n\n349\n00:16:58.203 --> 00:17:01.789\nI'm gonna take this NetRestore of\nLab Mac Mini that we made last episode.\n\n350\n00:17:01.789 --> 00:17:06.053\nAnd I'm just gonna drag it and\ndrop it right onto that USB key,\n\n351\n00:17:06.053 --> 00:17:08.930\nright there, that Lab Mac Mini Restore.\n\n352\n00:17:08.930 --> 00:17:11.650\nNow, again, if you're on USB\n2.0 this could take a while,\n\n353\n00:17:11.650 --> 00:17:14.150\nif you're on USB 3.0 it shouldn't be so\nbad.\n\n354\n00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:17.930\nBut that one's gonna run, I can see it's\ngiving me an estimate of about 6 minutes\n\n355\n00:17:17.930 --> 00:17:21.770\nand, as amazing as my stalling skills are,\nI don’t think I can stall for 6 minutes.\n\n356\n00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:23.640\nSo we might wanna take a pause and\npick it up.\n\n357\n00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:26.230\nBut it’s gonna copy this over, and\n\n358\n00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:29.260\nonce that’s copied over,\nI’ll be ready to bless it.\n\n359\n00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:31.880\nAnd in fact, we can actually start\nthat process while we're waiting.\n\n360\n00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:33.360\nIf I go back to my Automator,\n\n361\n00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:35.590\none of the first things that\ncopy does is create the folder.\n\n362\n00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:38.190\nSo I actually should be able\nto bless the folder right now.\n\n363\n00:17:38.190 --> 00:17:41.230\nFor Get Specified Finder Items,\nI'm gonna go ahead and hit Add.\n\n364\n00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:44.419\nAnd I'm gonna browse to that USB key.\n\n365\n00:17:46.911 --> 00:17:50.560\nRight here, my Lab Mac Mini Restore.\n\n366\n00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:54.070\nAnd it's still copying it but\nas soon as it's done copying,\n\n367\n00:17:54.070 --> 00:17:56.160\nI'll be able to choose that\ncuz it is just a folder.\n\n368\n00:17:56.160 --> 00:18:00.200\nAnd so I'll be able to choose that and\nadd it in to make that one bootable,\n\n369\n00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:02.268\nto have it blessed and be ready to go.\n\n370\n00:18:02.268 --> 00:18:04.112\nBut for right now, why don't we do this,\n\n371\n00:18:04.112 --> 00:18:07.554\nwe'll use the magic of television to\ntake a quick pause while that finishes.\n\n372\n00:18:07.554 --> 00:18:09.491\nAnd when we get back,\nwe'll jump right into that and\n\n373\n00:18:09.491 --> 00:18:12.192\nget a chance to see blessing that and\nthen booting from that NetRestore.\n\n374\n00:18:12.192 --> 00:18:13.600\nSo that should about do it.\n\n375\n00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:16.369\nLooks like we are done and [LAUGH]\nwe'll just jump right back in here and\n\n376\n00:18:16.369 --> 00:18:17.289\nget this one added in.\n\n377\n00:18:17.289 --> 00:18:19.630\nSo I'm gonna go right\nback into my Automator.\n\n378\n00:18:19.630 --> 00:18:23.740\nAnd when I got to Get Specified\nFinder Items, I can just hit Add.\n\n379\n00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:26.370\nAnd I'm gonna browse right\nback to that USB key.\n\n380\n00:18:26.370 --> 00:18:30.470\nAnd let me just find it,\nit is right here, Lab Mac Mini Restore.\n\n381\n00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:32.980\nAnd there's that nbi folder\nthat copied over and\n\n382\n00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:35.340\nI can select it now cuz it's done copying.\n\n383\n00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:37.630\nSo I'll add that one in, and there we go.\n\n384\n00:18:37.630 --> 00:18:40.362\nSo now I've got NetRestore\nof Lab Mac Mini.nbi,\n\n385\n00:18:40.362 --> 00:18:42.904\nthat's the folder that\nit's going to bless.\n\n386\n00:18:42.904 --> 00:18:45.548\nAnd it's giving the location\nof it being on the USB key and\n\n387\n00:18:45.548 --> 00:18:46.990\nthen we're blessing it here.\n\n388\n00:18:46.990 --> 00:18:49.600\nAnd we can apply custom label if we want.\n\n389\n00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:52.220\nThis will be the label that\nthe drive will show up as so\n\n390\n00:18:52.220 --> 00:18:56.410\nI might just call this Lab Mac Mini or\nsomething like that.\n\n391\n00:18:56.410 --> 00:18:59.210\nI forget the maximum characters that\nwe've got so I don't wanna push it.\n\n392\n00:18:59.210 --> 00:19:02.030\nBut maybe Lab Mac Restore.\n\n393\n00:19:02.030 --> 00:19:03.620\nAll right, so I'll give it a name.\n\n394\n00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:07.110\nSo now that it's got that,\nI can just take this and I can run it.\n\n395\n00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:09.330\nAnd when I run it,\nit's gonna bless that folder.\n\n396\n00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:13.080\nSo I'll hit Run and it\"s gonna prompt me\ncuz I gotta be an administrator to do\n\n397\n00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:16.860\nthis, so I will throw in a password.\n\n398\n00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:19.748\nAnd you gotta pay real close attention\nwith the Automator down here at the bottom\n\n399\n00:19:19.748 --> 00:19:20.750\nand make sure it finishes.\n\n400\n00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:24.600\nSee what it says Get Specified Finder\nItems completed, so it found the folder.\n\n401\n00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:28.050\nBless the Netboot Image,\nit did that and now it's done.\n\n402\n00:19:28.050 --> 00:19:31.060\nSo it's done,\nI don't need to save this workflow.\n\n403\n00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:34.972\nIt's already done all that it needs\nto do so I can just get out of it and\n\n404\n00:19:34.972 --> 00:19:36.974\nI'll delete what it's created.\n\n405\n00:19:36.974 --> 00:19:40.790\nAnd I've now got a blessed USB\ndrive that's ready to rock.\n\n406\n00:19:40.790 --> 00:19:43.240\nNow the USB drive itself isn't\ngonna look any different.\n\n407\n00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:45.400\nIt shows Lab Mac Mini Restore.\n\n408\n00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:50.540\nIf I browse into it really just the nbi,\nnot really anything has changed.\n\n409\n00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:53.870\nThe thing that's changed is that\nit's flagged the partition and\n\n410\n00:19:53.870 --> 00:19:58.050\nflagged that folder to be what we boot of\nso our Mac will be able to find it, right?\n\n411\n00:19:58.050 --> 00:20:01.580\nAt the end of the day, I end up\nwith a USB key that's now bootable.\n\n412\n00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:06.700\nAnd it doesn't matter if it's a stock El\nCapitan installer like I did first, or if\n\n413\n00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:11.230\nit's one of our NetInstall images which I\ndidn't do, or if it's a NetRestore image.\n\n414\n00:20:11.230 --> 00:20:15.520\nAt the end of the day,\nyou result with a bootable USB key.\n\n415\n00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:20.260\nNow you don't have to bless it if you\nuse the default El Capitan installer,\n\n416\n00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:21.620\nit does it itself.\n\n417\n00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:24.210\nIf you do NetInstall or\nNetRestore you do have to bless it,\n\n418\n00:20:24.210 --> 00:20:25.150\nthose are the two times you do.\n\n419\n00:20:25.150 --> 00:20:27.890\nAnd there's actually a little\nshortcut I know some people use.\n\n420\n00:20:27.890 --> 00:20:31.970\nIf you're building the image and\nyou're putting the image right\n\n421\n00:20:31.970 --> 00:20:36.622\nonto a USB drive at the build time, in\nthe System Image Utility you can bless it.\n\n422\n00:20:36.622 --> 00:20:40.175\nRight, cuz remember, in the System Image\nUtility we can fire up the Automator,\n\n423\n00:20:40.175 --> 00:20:42.750\nright, and\ncustomize that whole installation.\n\n424\n00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:44.686\nAnd so you've got the option\nto bless it right there too.\n\n425\n00:20:44.686 --> 00:20:47.824\nNow, for me, I'm usually building\nthese to put them on a server.\n\n426\n00:20:47.824 --> 00:20:49.616\nAnd you don't bless them on a server,\n\n427\n00:20:49.616 --> 00:20:52.130\nyou bless them when they\ngo on removable media.\n\n428\n00:20:52.130 --> 00:20:54.959\nSo I never really do it through\nthe System Image Utility, but\n\n429\n00:20:54.959 --> 00:20:57.743\nthat option is there just in case\nit ever pops up on the exam.\n\n430\n00:20:57.743 --> 00:21:01.460\nAll right, now let's take a look\nat this key in action, right.\n\n431\n00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:05.540\nSo I'm gonna eject this USB key really\nquick, let me just pop that thing out.\n\n432\n00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:07.965\nAnd we're gonna take it over to\nanother Mac and boot off of it.\n\n433\n00:21:07.965 --> 00:21:09.844\nAll right, so\nI'm gonna switch over to my Mac Mini here,\n\n434\n00:21:09.844 --> 00:21:11.655\nwhich we've got a black\nscreen cuz it's powered off.\n\n435\n00:21:11.655 --> 00:21:15.640\nAnd I'm going to hold the Alt key\non my keyboard while I power it on.\n\n436\n00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:19.890\nSo I'm holding down Alt, and\nnormally you'd see the Apple logo up here.\n\n437\n00:21:19.890 --> 00:21:21.991\nBut instead of seeing\nthe Apple logo up here,\n\n438\n00:21:21.991 --> 00:21:24.158\nI'm gonna see a list of\nthe disks in my system.\n\n439\n00:21:24.158 --> 00:21:26.540\nAnd it's gonna turn up and\nusually you'll see,\n\n440\n00:21:26.540 --> 00:21:29.048\ntypically you'll see three things here,\nright.\n\n441\n00:21:29.048 --> 00:21:32.987\nYou'll see a recovery drive,\nyou'll see your Macintosh HD,\n\n442\n00:21:32.987 --> 00:21:36.940\nand you'll see your USB,\nyour removable media, right?\n\n443\n00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:40.521\nIn my case I'm seeing two, I'm seeing\nmy recovery and my removable media.\n\n444\n00:21:40.521 --> 00:21:44.878\nAnd the reason is the Macintosh hard drive\nin this computer, it doesn't have Mac OS\n\n445\n00:21:44.878 --> 00:21:49.300\ninstalled on it, right, it's just\na blank hard drive and that's it, okay?\n\n446\n00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:51.450\nSo if you got a blank drive\nit can't boot that and so\n\n447\n00:21:51.450 --> 00:21:52.640\nit's not gonna show up here in the list.\n\n448\n00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:57.077\nSo this would be kind of like if\nmaybe I had a hard drive fail.\n\n449\n00:21:57.077 --> 00:21:59.786\nAnd I took the hard drive out of the Mac\nand I put a brand new hard drive in there\n\n450\n00:21:59.786 --> 00:22:02.163\nand it's completely empty,\nthis is what I would see right here.\n\n451\n00:22:02.163 --> 00:22:05.201\nRight, I would just see the recovery and\nthe removable media.\n\n452\n00:22:05.201 --> 00:22:07.630\nAnd in fact,\nI might not even see the recovery.\n\n453\n00:22:07.630 --> 00:22:08.860\nIf I had to replace the hard drive,\n\n454\n00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:10.920\nthe new hard drive might not\nhave recovery on it at all.\n\n455\n00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:13.210\nAnd so\nthen I would only see the USB media.\n\n456\n00:22:13.210 --> 00:22:16.900\nSo it may be different for you, but you'll\nnormally see something along these lines.\n\n457\n00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:20.653\nAnd I'm just gonna choose that removable\nmedia that we just finished making and\n\n458\n00:22:20.653 --> 00:22:22.175\nit's gonna to boot off of that.\n\n459\n00:22:22.175 --> 00:22:25.538\nNow I see the Apple logo, and\nit's starting to load the system.\n\n460\n00:22:25.538 --> 00:22:28.981\nAnd it's gonna take a little while,\nnormally we boot off the hard drive and\n\n461\n00:22:28.981 --> 00:22:32.560\nhard drives are pretty quick, got a lot\nof bandwidth and throughput to them.\n\n462\n00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:37.590\nBut when you boot off a USB,\nif it's USB 2.0, it's pretty darn slow.\n\n463\n00:22:37.590 --> 00:22:40.450\nIf it's USB 3.0, it can be a lot faster.\n\n464\n00:22:40.450 --> 00:22:43.160\nBut what it's doing it's booting recovery.\n\n465\n00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:47.180\nAnd the recovery partition that it's got,\nit's really about 600 megabytes in size,\n\n466\n00:22:47.180 --> 00:22:47.950\nit's not too bad.\n\n467\n00:22:47.950 --> 00:22:50.530\nSo it's booting up and\ncopying that into RAM.\n\n468\n00:22:50.530 --> 00:22:54.750\nAnd what that recovery is kind of\nlike a miniaturized version of OS X.\n\n469\n00:22:54.750 --> 00:22:56.950\nSo, a mini version of El Capitan.\n\n470\n00:22:56.950 --> 00:23:01.900\nAnd once it comes up,\nit's gonna see the blessed NetBoot folder.\n\n471\n00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:05.490\nAnd it's gonna find that NetRestore\nimage that we put on there, or\n\n472\n00:23:05.490 --> 00:23:07.350\nthe NetInstall image, whichever one it is.\n\n473\n00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:10.110\nAnd it's gonna start the restore.\n\n474\n00:23:10.110 --> 00:23:14.093\nNow, if I checked the option that said\nI want to install to the Macintosh HD,\n\n475\n00:23:14.093 --> 00:23:16.971\ngo ahead and erase it,\nthen it's gonna go automatic.\n\n476\n00:23:16.971 --> 00:23:17.761\nIt's just gonna go and\n\n477\n00:23:17.761 --> 00:23:21.100\nI'm not gonna have to tell it anything,\nit'll start the restore.\n\n478\n00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:25.490\nBut if you've got a blank hard drive or\na hard drive where the name doesn't match,\n\n479\n00:23:25.490 --> 00:23:27.050\nthen it's gonna have to ask\nme where to install it.\n\n480\n00:23:27.050 --> 00:23:29.570\nAnd so we'll see one of those two\nthings appear here in just a moment,\n\n481\n00:23:29.570 --> 00:23:30.830\nas that little bar ticks across.\n\n482\n00:23:30.830 --> 00:23:34.430\nAnd, in my case,\nit found the Macintosh HD,\n\n483\n00:23:34.430 --> 00:23:38.250\ndidn't ask me a single question,\nand started the restore.\n\n484\n00:23:38.250 --> 00:23:39.370\nAnd so here I see it's going,\n\n485\n00:23:39.370 --> 00:23:42.720\nit's restoring that image and\nit's fully automated.\n\n486\n00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:46.354\nAnd it was that option that we checked\nthat said, Install to McIntosh HD and\n\n487\n00:23:46.354 --> 00:23:47.866\ngo ahead and erase it, right.\n\n488\n00:23:47.866 --> 00:23:49.088\nThat's what made it\nwhere it was automated.\n\n489\n00:23:49.088 --> 00:23:50.408\nIf I hadn't chosen that,\n\n490\n00:23:50.408 --> 00:23:53.837\nI would have seen a screen asking\nme to pick which hard drive format.\n\n491\n00:23:53.837 --> 00:23:57.625\nAnd then it would format it and deploy,\nand so that's a little variation that\n\n492\n00:23:57.625 --> 00:24:00.962\nwe get there But, now it's putting\nthat NetRestore image on here.\n\n493\n00:24:00.962 --> 00:24:05.050\nAnd then that restore image was\nEl Capitan, with CyberDoc, and\n\n494\n00:24:05.050 --> 00:24:10.048\nGoogle Chrome installed, and some icons\nremoved out of the doc at the bottom,\n\n495\n00:24:10.048 --> 00:24:14.387\nand the wallpaper changed to\nthe space layout, or whatever it was.\n\n496\n00:24:14.387 --> 00:24:17.192\nAnd the power settings,\nwe changed the power settings in it, and\n\n497\n00:24:17.192 --> 00:24:18.270\nit's doing that stuff.\n\n498\n00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:23.270\nIf this was our NetInstall image,\nand it was the stock El Capitan,\n\n499\n00:24:23.270 --> 00:24:26.110\nit would just be copying that hard\ndrive and that's the end of it.\n\n500\n00:24:26.110 --> 00:24:29.130\nIf it was our customized NetInstall image,\n\n501\n00:24:29.130 --> 00:24:34.370\nit would copy the install over and then\nit would run through the Automator steps.\n\n502\n00:24:34.370 --> 00:24:37.770\nAnd remember, we had Automator steps\nthat installed VirtualBox, right, and\n\n503\n00:24:37.770 --> 00:24:39.750\nset the power saving settings on.\n\n504\n00:24:39.750 --> 00:24:42.250\nIt would run through each of\nthose after it copies over.\n\n505\n00:24:42.250 --> 00:24:44.962\nBut, basically,\nat this point you get to sit here and\n\n506\n00:24:44.962 --> 00:24:48.535\nwatch the status bar creep across\nthe green screen slowly and slowly.\n\n507\n00:24:48.535 --> 00:24:51.188\nMy image is about nine gigs in size.\n\n508\n00:24:51.188 --> 00:24:54.743\nSo copying nine gigs on a USB 3 disk\nwill take probably four or five minutes.\n\n509\n00:24:54.743 --> 00:24:57.136\nSo we can let that churn along.\n\n510\n00:24:57.136 --> 00:25:01.390\nIf you really have big image though, let's\nsay your image is 200 gigs and you've got\n\n511\n00:25:01.390 --> 00:25:05.145\nit on an external USB hard drive, and\nyou hook it up, this could take an hour.\n\n512\n00:25:05.145 --> 00:25:06.740\nIt could take two hours, right?\n\n513\n00:25:06.740 --> 00:25:09.530\nAnd that's not a big deal if\nyou're just restoring one machine.\n\n514\n00:25:09.530 --> 00:25:12.560\nBut what if I have 1,000\nmachines to restore?\n\n515\n00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:16.040\nI take my one little USB key and\nI go to the first machine and I start it.\n\n516\n00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:17.570\nI come back two hours from now.\n\n517\n00:25:17.570 --> 00:25:21.370\nAnd then I take that USB key and I come\nback to the second one, and I restart it.\n\n518\n00:25:21.370 --> 00:25:22.660\nAnd then the third one,\nand the fourth one.\n\n519\n00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:25.820\nI can only do one at a time cuz\nI've only got one USB disk.\n\n520\n00:25:25.820 --> 00:25:26.840\nSo what are my options?\n\n521\n00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:29.180\nWell, I could buy a lot more USB disks.\n\n522\n00:25:29.180 --> 00:25:29.888\nWe could do that.\n\n523\n00:25:29.888 --> 00:25:30.799\nI got 1,000 computers.\n\n524\n00:25:30.799 --> 00:25:35.097\nI could buy 1,000 USB keys and plug one\ninto each computer, boot them all holding\n\n525\n00:25:35.097 --> 00:25:39.590\nthe alt key, and choose that USB key,\nand now my 1,000 machines are done.\n\n526\n00:25:39.590 --> 00:25:41.890\nHonestly, it's not so bad, right?\n\n527\n00:25:41.890 --> 00:25:43.140\nYou gotta build 1,000 USB keys.\n\n528\n00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:46.080\nThat's not any fun, but it does work.\n\n529\n00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:48.270\nBut the better option would be to say,\n\n530\n00:25:48.270 --> 00:25:50.620\nlet's just do this over the network,\ninstead.\n\n531\n00:25:50.620 --> 00:25:54.150\nOver the network, I don't need all\nthese USB keys any more, right?\n\n532\n00:25:54.150 --> 00:25:58.550\nI can boot from the network resource, and\nI can load the NBI from the network, and\n\n533\n00:25:58.550 --> 00:25:59.940\npull it that way.\n\n534\n00:25:59.940 --> 00:26:02.790\nAnd now I don't have to have all of\nthese USB keys that are out there.\n\n535\n00:26:02.790 --> 00:26:03.560\nI mean you can still do it.\n\n536\n00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:06.370\nYou can still put the USB keys in,\nand go that route if you want.\n\n537\n00:26:06.370 --> 00:26:10.180\nIf you're doing one, or five, or\nten, the USB keys work great.\n\n538\n00:26:10.180 --> 00:26:14.330\nBut if you were doing 1,000, the network\ndeployment's gonna be the better option.\n\n539\n00:26:14.330 --> 00:26:17.200\nSo I'm just kinda stalling\nwhile this finishes.\n\n540\n00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:18.760\nSo what we've seen here in this episode,\n\n541\n00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:22.670\nwe built a USB key that was a stock,\nOS X El Capitan installer.\n\n542\n00:26:22.670 --> 00:26:24.570\nWe built that right from\nthe installation app.\n\n543\n00:26:25.610 --> 00:26:30.020\nWe copied a NetRestore image,\nidentical for NetInstall.\n\n544\n00:26:30.020 --> 00:26:33.170\nYou would copy it over,\ncuz it doesn't really care what it is.\n\n545\n00:26:33.170 --> 00:26:34.630\nAnd then we saw blessing that folder.\n\n546\n00:26:34.630 --> 00:26:35.810\nThat's really important to set that.\n\n547\n00:26:35.810 --> 00:26:37.280\nThere will be a question\non the exam about that.\n\n548\n00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:39.460\nThere always is about\nblessing that folder.\n\n549\n00:26:39.460 --> 00:26:42.750\nAnd then after that,\nwe just boot off the USB key, and we go.\n\n550\n00:26:42.750 --> 00:26:46.180\nOnce you boot off the USB key, it really\ndoesn't matter where that image came from.\n\n551\n00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:47.780\nIt all deploy its kind of the same way.\n\n552\n00:26:47.780 --> 00:26:50.060\nIt's gonna churn along,\nand then it'll be done.\n\n553\n00:26:50.060 --> 00:26:54.910\nNow, when this finishes, the systems gonna\nreboot, and I'm done with the USB key.\n\n554\n00:26:54.910 --> 00:26:56.190\nI can take it out, and\n\n555\n00:26:56.190 --> 00:27:00.330\nnow I've got a machine with built\nexactly around that NetRestore image.\n\n556\n00:27:00.330 --> 00:27:02.780\nAlright, let's check on our progress and\nsee where we're at on this one.\n\n557\n00:27:02.780 --> 00:27:04.050\nLooks like it's almost done.\n\n558\n00:27:04.050 --> 00:27:09.590\nNow what you'll see sometimes is where\nit'll copy over files that are compressed,\n\n559\n00:27:09.590 --> 00:27:11.260\nand then it's gotta decompress them.\n\n560\n00:27:11.260 --> 00:27:14.040\nSo sometimes this last step\ncan take a little bit.\n\n561\n00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:18.120\nSo our status bar, that we just\nsaw reach all the way to the side,\n\n562\n00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:20.600\nnow it jumps back to the beginning\nas it starts to decompress.\n\n563\n00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:24.100\nAnd again, our image is small,\nshould happen pretty fast.\n\n564\n00:27:24.100 --> 00:27:28.420\nBut once it's done,\nwe'll have our good system ready to go.\n\n565\n00:27:28.420 --> 00:27:30.840\nAll right, well, I make this comment Wes,\n\n566\n00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:35.650\nthat I've spent a good 50% of my career\nwatching bars like these scroll across\n\n567\n00:27:35.650 --> 00:27:39.590\nthe screen, and\nit's better than digging a ditch.\n\n568\n00:27:39.590 --> 00:27:41.360\n>> It certainly is [LAUGH].\n\n569\n00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:45.600\nI think, one time, you told me 30% of\nyour IT career is waiting for a reboot.\n\n570\n00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:48.870\n>> Those are all the kind of\nthings that fall into this.\n\n571\n00:27:48.870 --> 00:27:53.060\nFortunately, it's all automated, and\nit could have been much more involved.\n\n572\n00:27:53.060 --> 00:27:56.600\nIf I'd done the stock installer,\nit has to do all sorts of things.\n\n573\n00:27:56.600 --> 00:28:00.380\nYou have to give it a user name, you pick\na password, you pick the icon for your\n\n574\n00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:04.400\naccount, you pick what drive to install,\nyou sign off on the licensing agreement.\n\n575\n00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:07.240\nAll of those are things that\nhappen during that process.\n\n576\n00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:09.460\nBut here, I didn't tell it a single thing.\n\n577\n00:28:09.460 --> 00:28:12.280\nI just booted off the USB key,\nand then walked away.\n\n578\n00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:15.540\nAnd now it's done, and\nit's actually booting from the hard drive.\n\n579\n00:28:15.540 --> 00:28:17.190\nRight?\nAnd I didn't have to tell it to do that.\n\n580\n00:28:17.190 --> 00:28:18.140\nIt's doing it on it's own.\n\n581\n00:28:18.140 --> 00:28:19.510\nIt's gonna move through that, and\n\n582\n00:28:19.510 --> 00:28:22.020\nit's gonna get everything put\nback the way that I want it.\n\n583\n00:28:22.020 --> 00:28:25.320\nSo now it's booting it, and\nyou guy's cant see this the way I can,\n\n584\n00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:26.940\nbut I'm looking at the USB key here.\n\n585\n00:28:26.940 --> 00:28:28.850\nIt's got a little red light\nthat flashes when it's reading,\n\n586\n00:28:28.850 --> 00:28:30.140\nand it's not flashing, right?\n\n587\n00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:32.410\nWe're not reading from the USB\nkey at all at this point.\n\n588\n00:28:32.410 --> 00:28:34.530\nIt's booting from the hard drive.\n\n589\n00:28:34.530 --> 00:28:35.900\nAnd when we're done,\n\n590\n00:28:35.900 --> 00:28:39.080\nwe'll end up with a system whose\nresolution might not be right.\n\n591\n00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:40.390\nWe'll see here in a second.\n\n592\n00:28:40.390 --> 00:28:42.475\nI got a little black screen coming up.\n\n593\n00:28:42.475 --> 00:28:45.300\nIt can reboot a few times,\ndepending on what it's doing.\n\n594\n00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:46.920\nSo it might actually have\nto go into one more reboot.\n\n595\n00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:50.500\nAnd then when it's done, we'll be greeted\nwith our El Capitan installer cuz it has\n\n596\n00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:52.098\nto do a few things in the background.\n\n597\n00:28:52.098 --> 00:28:54.118\nThere's like Automator steps,\nand stuff that goes on.\n\n598\n00:28:54.118 --> 00:28:56.463\nAll right, actually,\nlooks like it finished booting.\n\n599\n00:28:56.463 --> 00:28:59.169\nSo I'm now booted up,\nI'm on my Mac screen, and, honestly,\n\n600\n00:28:59.169 --> 00:29:03.410\nI should have unplugged my USB key before,\nbut I'm not running from the USB key.\n\n601\n00:29:03.410 --> 00:29:07.720\nAnd I can get logged into this thing and\nwhat I should see when I log in,\n\n602\n00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:12.865\nI'm gonna fill my IT should in there,\nis that we're running El Capitan, and\n\n603\n00:29:12.865 --> 00:29:14.010\nthat it's setup the way we want.\n\n604\n00:29:14.010 --> 00:29:17.020\nAlready I can see we've got\nthe space wallpaper instead of\n\n605\n00:29:17.020 --> 00:29:20.750\nthe shadowy mountains, or wherever\nthat we normally have with El Capitan.\n\n606\n00:29:20.750 --> 00:29:25.670\nAnd as it gets in, what I expect to see\nis Google Cyber Docs, Google Chrome,\n\n607\n00:29:25.670 --> 00:29:26.910\nand sure enough there they are.\n\n608\n00:29:26.910 --> 00:29:28.950\nSo I've got the applications\nthat I wanted,\n\n609\n00:29:28.950 --> 00:29:32.060\nthey're already there,\niBooks is out of the dock, right?\n\n610\n00:29:32.060 --> 00:29:35.630\nAll those other things that get in there\nthat get in the way of my end users,\n\n611\n00:29:35.630 --> 00:29:38.498\nthose are all gone, and\nwe're up, and we're running.\n\n612\n00:29:38.498 --> 00:29:40.070\nIt's pretty slick stuff.\n\n613\n00:29:40.070 --> 00:29:43.970\nSo I could take this, this USB key right\nhere, and go to as many machines as I\n\n614\n00:29:43.970 --> 00:29:48.700\nwant, and create this exact system,\nthat has the software,\n\n615\n00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:51.620\nthe configuration settings,\neverything in place, and off we go.\n\n616\n00:29:51.620 --> 00:29:54.670\nIn fact, the only thing that\nreally got randomized on this\n\n617\n00:29:54.670 --> 00:29:55.850\nwould be the computer name.\n\n618\n00:29:55.850 --> 00:29:59.550\nSo if I jump into System Preferences,\nand go into Sharing, I told it,\n\n619\n00:29:59.550 --> 00:30:01.370\nyou know honestly I don't remember.\n\n620\n00:30:01.370 --> 00:30:04.600\nI think I told it to prefix\nit with the word lab, and\n\n621\n00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:07.620\nthen add a random string to the end\nof it when we were in that wizard.\n\n622\n00:30:07.620 --> 00:30:09.670\nI probably should have\npaid more attention.\n\n623\n00:30:09.670 --> 00:30:12.655\nAnd if I look at it, sure enough,\nI can see where it says lab, and\n\n624\n00:30:12.655 --> 00:30:15.600\nthen it's followed by kind\nof a random mess there.\n\n625\n00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:17.620\nSo it's given it that unique name, but\n\n626\n00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:20.890\neverything else is exactly\nas that image was built.\n\n627\n00:30:20.890 --> 00:30:24.190\nThis guy is ready to be distributed\nto my end users or whoever.\n\n628\n00:30:24.190 --> 00:30:25.090\n>> Great information.\n\n629\n00:30:25.090 --> 00:30:28.370\nNow in this episode, keep in mind, that\nwe've been looking at how you can deploy\n\n630\n00:30:28.370 --> 00:30:31.980\nyour operating system with removable\nmedia, typically a USB device, and\n\n631\n00:30:31.980 --> 00:30:33.540\nhow to format that USB device.\n\n632\n00:30:33.540 --> 00:30:34.420\nGreat information Don.\n\n633\n00:30:34.420 --> 00:30:36.040\nGot anything else for us in this one?\n\n634\n00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:39.810\nWell, remember that the USB stuff sure is\nconvenient, but it doesn't work at scale.\n\n635\n00:30:39.810 --> 00:30:41.980\nAnd so in the next episode we're\ngonna see the same thing, but\n\n636\n00:30:41.980 --> 00:30:43.670\nby using a NetInstall server.\n\n637\n00:30:43.670 --> 00:30:46.720\nSo we're gonna do it over the network,\nand that's the far cooler way to do it.\n\n638\n00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:48.290\nSo you'll definitely wanna tune in for\nthat one.\n\n639\n00:30:48.290 --> 00:30:49.370\n>> Great information.\n\n640\n00:30:49.370 --> 00:30:54.180\nSo much more exciting content to come\nin our Mac Management Basics but\n\n641\n00:30:54.180 --> 00:30:56.260\nwe're gonna go ahead and\nsign out for this episode.\n\n642\n00:30:56.260 --> 00:30:57.390\nI've been your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n643\n00:30:57.390 --> 00:30:58.410\n>> And I'm Don Pazet.\n\n644\n00:30:58.410 --> 00:31:00.098\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n645\n00:31:00.098 -->

00:00:16.227\nI'm your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n4\n00:00:16.227 --> 00:00:20.005\nAnd in today's episode, we're gonna be\nmoving through Mac management basics.\n\n5\n00:00:20.005 --> 00:00:22.635\nAnd we've got none other than Mr.\nDon Pezet here to help us out.\n\n6\n00:00:22.635 --> 00:00:24.075\nDon, how are you doing today, sir?\n\n7\n00:00:24.075 --> 00:00:24.925\n>> I'm doing great, Wes.\n\n8\n00:00:24.925 --> 00:00:28.405\nReady to jump right back into\nthe world of deploying Mac OS over,\n\n9\n00:00:28.405 --> 00:00:30.837\nwell, whatever system it is\nthat we're gonna be doing.\n\n10\n00:00:30.837 --> 00:00:33.773\nIn our last episode, we got a chance\nto see how to deploy our NetInstall and\n\n11\n00:00:33.773 --> 00:00:37.390\nNetRestore images by using USB keys or\nremovable media.\n\n12\n00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.180\nIn this episode,\nwe're gonna do the fun one,\n\n13\n00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.090\nwhich is deploying those same images but\ndoing it via the network,\n\n14\n00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:46.160\nwhich is far more efficient when you've\ngot a large quantity of systems.\n\n15\n00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.350\nSo, still working with those\nsame NetInstall, same NetRestore\n\n16\n00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.610\nimages as before but this time,\nwe're gonna send them over the network.\n\n17\n00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.280\nAnd that means we don't need\nthose removable keys any more and\n\n18\n00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.710\nwe get a much more scalable solution.\n\n19\n00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.150\nAll right, well let's kick things off.\n\n20\n00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:03.150\nI just kinda wanna start by identifying\nthe differences here cuz what we're about\n\n21\n00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.440\nto do is actually very similar to\nwhat we did in the last episode.\n\n22\n00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:10.310\nIn the last episode, we took a Mac Mini,\nand I stuck a USB key in it and\n\n23\n00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.070\nthat USB key had my\nNetRestore image on it.\n\n24\n00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.040\nAnd it was blessed so\nthat it would boot and\n\n25\n00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.970\nwe got a chance to see booting\nup off that USB key, and\n\n26\n00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.650\nI did that by holding down the Alt key\non that client while we turned it on.\n\n27\n00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.380\nAnd it showed the USB key.\n\n28\n00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:25.030\nWe booted from it.\n\n29\n00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.080\nAnd then it automatically installed OS X.\n\n30\n00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:28.540\nAnd we were up and running in short order.\n\n31\n00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:31.950\nI think the whole process took less\nthan ten minutes to get that Mac\n\n32\n00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.140\ndeployed and ready to rock.\n\n33\n00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.120\nOkay and that worked fine,\nexcept for that USB key part, right?\n\n34\n00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:38.170\nThe fact that I got to have a key.\n\n35\n00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.990\nAnd the comment I made in\n\n36\n00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.460\nthe last episode was this works\ngreat if I have one machine.\n\n37\n00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.530\nBut what if I wanna do\n1000 machines at once?\n\n38\n00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.784\nWell, if I want to do them all at the same\ntime I would need 1000 USB keys and\n\n39\n00:01:48.784 --> 00:01:50.623\nthat's just not ideal, right.\n\n40\n00:01:50.623 --> 00:01:52.661\nI don't want to have to go out and\nget all this different,\n\n41\n00:01:52.661 --> 00:01:54.161\nthese different USB keys laying around.\n\n42\n00:01:54.161 --> 00:01:57.211\nSo by setting up\na centralized network server,\n\n43\n00:01:57.211 --> 00:02:01.341\nwe can take this a step further and\nmake things a lot more simple.\n\n44\n00:02:01.341 --> 00:02:05.772\nWhen our Macs boot up, you can tell\nthem not to boot from a USB key but\n\n45\n00:02:05.772 --> 00:02:08.080\ninstead to boot from the network.\n\n46\n00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.194\nAnd when they boot from the network,\nthey'll look out at the network and\n\n47\n00:02:11.194 --> 00:02:13.607\nthey'll look for\nwhat's called a NetInstall server.\n\n48\n00:02:13.607 --> 00:02:17.304\nAnd a NetInstall server is just a Mac\nsomewhere on your network that's\n\n49\n00:02:17.304 --> 00:02:21.610\nholding a copy of your images and\nmaking them available via the network.\n\n50\n00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.113\nAnd so I can boot 1000 machines to\nthe network without using USB key.\n\n51\n00:02:26.113 --> 00:02:29.922\nAnd they find a NetInstall server where I\ncan have all my images stored right there\n\n52\n00:02:29.922 --> 00:02:31.050\nand we can boot from it.\n\n53\n00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.550\nAnd if I decide to update my images,\nI just update them on the server.\n\n54\n00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.087\nAnd now when I start deploying, we'll\nbe deploying the new image versus if I\n\n55\n00:02:39.087 --> 00:02:42.858\nhad made 1000 USB keys, and I decide to\nupdate my image, what do I have to do?\n\n56\n00:02:42.858 --> 00:02:44.553\nI'm gonna update a 1000 USB keys.\n\n57\n00:02:44.553 --> 00:02:45.465\nThat's not realistic.\n\n58\n00:02:45.465 --> 00:02:46.780\nNobody is gonna do that.\n\n59\n00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.015\nUnless you're an hourly employee.\n\n60\n00:02:48.015 --> 00:02:51.660\n[LAUGH] And you're trying to justify your\nbudget, whatever it is, maybe there.\n\n61\n00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.010\nBut realistically,\nnobody's gonna do that, right?\n\n62\n00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.330\nSo the NetInstall server\nis really the way to go.\n\n63\n00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:01.190\nAnd what I always tell people is for me,\nif it's five computers, ten computers, and\n\n64\n00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.208\nI'm just doing this deployment one time.\n\n65\n00:03:03.208 --> 00:03:07.910\nI'll use NetRestore, I'll do boots\noff of a USB and I'll go that route.\n\n66\n00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:11.070\nBut if it's gonna be hundreds or\nthousands of machines and\n\n67\n00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:14.460\nI'm not just doing it one time,\nI'm gonna be doing this periodically and\n\n68\n00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:18.880\nthe images have to update, I'm gonna\ndo NetInstall and NetInstall Servers.\n\n69\n00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.243\nRight, so NetInstall images cuz\nthey're really easy to update and\n\n70\n00:03:22.243 --> 00:03:25.470\na NetInstall Server so\nI can make it available via the network.\n\n71\n00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.580\nNow what we're gonna see in this episode,\n\n72\n00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:29.630\nI'm gonna show you guys how to\nset up a NetInstall server.\n\n73\n00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:31.620\nAnd I'm gonna call it that\ncuz Apple calls it that.\n\n74\n00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.350\nThey call it a NetInstall server.\n\n75\n00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:36.510\nBut you can serve up NetRestore\nimages from a NetInstall server.\n\n76\n00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.810\nAnd you can serve up NetBoot images.\n\n77\n00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:43.270\nSo even though it's a NetInstall server,\nNetBoot, NetInstall, NetRestore,\n\n78\n00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:45.930\nthose images all work from\nthe NetInstall server.\n\n79\n00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:49.820\nAll right and you'll see that it's\nactually pretty easy to get it going.\n\n80\n00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:53.490\nThe first thing that we're gonna need to\nget this guy up and running is we're going\n\n81\n00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:58.460\nto need a Mac server somewhere, and\nWes was asking about this before the show.\n\n82\n00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:01.600\nA Mac server's really not anything\nspecial, it's just a Mac that you picked\n\n83\n00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:04.950\nand you say, I want that to be\na server right, and that's it.\n\n84\n00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:09.293\nSo you might already have\na Mac Mini laying around or\n\n85\n00:04:09.293 --> 00:04:12.121\na Mac Pro or something like that.\n\n86\n00:04:12.121 --> 00:04:13.452\nI'm gonna use my laptop here on the show.\n\n87\n00:04:13.452 --> 00:04:16.269\nYou probably don't wanna do that because\nyou want something that's always\n\n88\n00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:17.070\navailable, right.\n\n89\n00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.650\nAnd since we're pushing\nimages over the network,\n\n90\n00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:23.010\nyou want something that's physically\nplugged into the network.\n\n91\n00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.520\nI don't want to do this over\nthe wireless because it's gonna be\n\n92\n00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.510\nreally slow over wireless.\n\n93\n00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:29.870\nBut if I have a physical network\nconnection, that's gonna work better.\n\n94\n00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:31.750\nSo laptops aren't the greatest candidate.\n\n95\n00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:32.455\nYou can certainly do it.\n\n96\n00:04:32.455 --> 00:04:33.454\nI'm about to do it.\n\n97\n00:04:33.454 --> 00:04:37.558\nBut ideally, you'll have a Mac Mini\nstashed away somewhere, or\n\n98\n00:04:37.558 --> 00:04:42.648\na Mac Pro that is wired into the network\nand is serving as that NetInstall server.\n\n99\n00:04:42.648 --> 00:04:45.769\nNow, in this show we've seen a lot\nof different technologies, and\n\n100\n00:04:45.769 --> 00:04:47.920\nmay be you have or\nhaven't set up a server yet.\n\n101\n00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:50.430\nIf you've watched our profile manager\nepisodes we messed with server\n\n102\n00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:51.780\nthere a little bit.\n\n103\n00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:54.240\nBut getting a NetInstall server in place,\n\n104\n00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.280\nthe first step is getting\nOS X Server installed.\n\n105\n00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.595\nAll right, and the way we do\nthat if you don't have it is,\n\n106\n00:04:59.595 --> 00:05:01.010\nI'll show you here on my laptop.\n\n107\n00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:03.145\nI've already got it installed but\nI'll walk through the process.\n\n108\n00:05:03.145 --> 00:05:05.606\nStep one, we fire up our App Store, right.\n\n109\n00:05:05.606 --> 00:05:08.312\nWe need to go into the Apple App Store and\nin there,\n\n110\n00:05:08.312 --> 00:05:10.769\nyou just need to do a quick search for\nserver.\n\n111\n00:05:10.769 --> 00:05:12.860\nRight, and\nmy App Store is running really slow today.\n\n112\n00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:13.380\nThere we go.\n\n113\n00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:17.680\nSo I could do Lego Avengers but instead,\nI think I'm gonna do OS X Server.\n\n114\n00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:21.430\nSo I'm just gonna do a quick search for\nserver and when I search for\n\n115\n00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:22.070\nthat, it'll turn up.\n\n116\n00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:23.290\nIt'll be one of the first results.\n\n117\n00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:26.710\nThere it is, little OS X Server and\nit's from Apple, right?\n\n118\n00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:27.910\nThere's other products that are out there.\n\n119\n00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:28.790\nThat's not what I want.\n\n120\n00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:30.410\nI don't want a Blockhead Server.\n\n121\n00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:32.420\nI want that OS X Server.\n\n122\n00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:34.500\nI've already bought it and\nit's already installed for me.\n\n123\n00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:35.680\nSo it says Open.\n\n124\n00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.290\nBut if you haven't bought it yet\nit cost $20.\n\n125\n00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:42.620\nAnd it used to be super annoying because\nevery version of OS X that came out,\n\n126\n00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:43.530\nyou had to buy it again.\n\n127\n00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:46.924\nSo if I have Mavericks and\nI bought it, I paid $20.\n\n128\n00:05:46.924 --> 00:05:50.042\nNow when Yosemite came out,\nI paid $20 again to buy for Yosemite.\n\n129\n00:05:50.042 --> 00:05:51.038\nThey don't do that anymore.\n\n130\n00:05:51.038 --> 00:05:54.350\nNow you buy it once and\nit works on all the newer platforms.\n\n131\n00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:56.150\nSo, it's only $20 and\n\n132\n00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:59.990\nyou can install it on any machine you're\nlogged in with your iTunes account, right?\n\n133\n00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:02.740\nSo, if I wanna bring up five servers,\nit's only 20 bucks.\n\n134\n00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:04.260\nIt's a really easy thing to do.\n\n135\n00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:05.790\nSo, we need to get that installed.\n\n136\n00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:08.140\nSo, you buy it and then you install it.\n\n137\n00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:09.120\nAnd once it's installed,\n\n138\n00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:13.020\nyou just crack it open and that's gonna\ntake us into the server software.\n\n139\n00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:14.790\nSo, I'm gonna go ahead and\nopen that right here.\n\n140\n00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:19.210\nAnd so here I am,\nit's connected to DPLAPTOP-OSX, and again,\n\n141\n00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:21.900\nyou probably don't wanna use a laptop for\nthis, because at the end of the day,\n\n142\n00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:25.970\nif I turn my laptop off and\ntake it home, can people deploy images?\n\n143\n00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:27.535\nNo, I just took the imaging\nserver with me.\n\n144\n00:06:27.535 --> 00:06:30.971\nRIght, so we want it to be a stable\nsystem that's available on our network.\n\n145\n00:06:30.971 --> 00:06:35.003\nNow, once you're into OS X server,\non the left side you'll see\n\n146\n00:06:35.003 --> 00:06:40.390\nall the different services that we've\ngot and NetInstall is not one of them.\n\n147\n00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:43.316\nAnd that's because a lot\nof people don't use it.\n\n148\n00:06:43.316 --> 00:06:46.243\nA lot of people have usually have small\nshops and they just use the USB keys and\n\n149\n00:06:46.243 --> 00:06:47.080\nthat's it.\n\n150\n00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:50.770\nBut it's down here under Advanced,\nand so if I Iook under Advance,\n\n151\n00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:55.360\nyou'll see there's more services and\nthere is NetInstall right there.\n\n152\n00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:59.740\nSo, here where I can come in, and\nI can turn on the NetInstall server.\n\n153\n00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:02.020\nNow, it's installed by default.\n\n154\n00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:06.470\nNetInstall is installed when you install\nOS X server but it's not turned on,\n\n155\n00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:08.370\nsee I got my little off button here.\n\n156\n00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:11.640\nAnd that's important because there's\ngonna be some things that I wanna change\n\n157\n00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:12.940\nbefore I turn it on.\n\n158\n00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:14.300\nAnd I need to give it images anyway.\n\n159\n00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:16.540\nIt doesn't have any images,\nnot really gonna work.\n\n160\n00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:21.190\nSo when we get this setup, there's not\na whole heck of a lot we have to do.\n\n161\n00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:24.160\nTechnically, you could just\nflip the on switch and\n\n162\n00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:25.880\ncopy your images into it and you're done.\n\n163\n00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:28.020\nIt's that easy right?\n\n164\n00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:31.100\nBut I usually like to customize a few\nthings so let me walk you through those.\n\n165\n00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:33.820\nWe start on the Settings tab and\nthen you got the Connections tab.\n\n166\n00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:36.810\nConnections, you can see who's\nconnected and getting images right now.\n\n167\n00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:38.840\nI'm just gonna start\non my Settings tab and\n\n168\n00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:43.340\nas you go down the first one is the most\nimportant one Storage Locations.\n\n169\n00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:44.750\nI'm on my laptop.\n\n170\n00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:47.212\nI don't have a ton of\nstorage here on my laptop.\n\n171\n00:07:47.212 --> 00:07:50.046\nAnd if you get a Mac Mini, you might not\nhave a ton of storage on the Mac Mini.\n\n172\n00:07:50.046 --> 00:07:53.004\nSo you might have an external\ndrive attached to your Mac.\n\n173\n00:07:53.004 --> 00:07:56.837\nAnd that's where you want your images to\nbe Your images can get to be really large.\n\n174\n00:07:56.837 --> 00:07:59.171\nSo we probably went some\nexternal storage for that.\n\n175\n00:07:59.171 --> 00:08:03.450\nSo one of the first things that I do is\nchange where that storage is going to be.\n\n176\n00:08:03.450 --> 00:08:05.200\nSo I'm gonna go and\nedit my Storage Location.\n\n177\n00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:09.465\nAnd it's got my Macintosh hard drive,\nI'm I'm gonna choose my External SSD.\n\n178\n00:08:09.465 --> 00:08:13.315\nThat's where I wanna be storing my images\nbecause I've got more room over there.\n\n179\n00:08:13.315 --> 00:08:15.465\nAnd then you can choose\nwhat to store there.\n\n180\n00:08:15.465 --> 00:08:17.155\nAnd see they both say None right now.\n\n181\n00:08:17.155 --> 00:08:20.415\nI don't have any data to store so\nthere's nothing available.\n\n182\n00:08:20.415 --> 00:08:25.635\nBut if I drop that down there's two\ndifferent things I can store, Images and\n\n183\n00:08:25.635 --> 00:08:27.780\nClient Data, okay?\n\n184\n00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:29.710\nImages, those are the images\nwe've been building.\n\n185\n00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:33.990\nThe net install images,\nthe net boot images, those things.\n\n186\n00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:39.150\nClient data, that's where we're doing\nthings like back ups of the client.\n\n187\n00:08:39.150 --> 00:08:42.070\nThat you can take time machine backups\neven and throw them in here and\n\n188\n00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:42.760\nrestore from it.\n\n189\n00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:44.170\nIt's kind of an interesting process.\n\n190\n00:08:44.170 --> 00:08:46.350\nYou can restore somebody's\ncomputer via the network.\n\n191\n00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:48.870\nSo there's a few different things\nyou can do there with client data.\n\n192\n00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:51.690\nMost people don't use that but I usually\njust come in here and say I'm gonna store\n\n193\n00:08:51.690 --> 00:08:55.540\nimages and client data on that drive, but\nyou could split them off if you wanted.\n\n194\n00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:59.300\nIf you wanted to make sure that your\nimages drive always had storage, and\n\n195\n00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:01.330\nyour client data never filled\nup the whole hard drive and\n\n196\n00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:03.440\nstopped your images from\nworking you can do that.\n\n197\n00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:06.070\nI'm just gonna leave them together,\nimages & Client Data.\n\n198\n00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:07.990\nAnd I'm not gonna put anything\non my internal hard drive,\n\n199\n00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:09.310\njust because I've got limited space.\n\n200\n00:09:10.690 --> 00:09:13.300\nAll right,\nnow notice this little message right here.\n\n201\n00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:14.580\nA lot of people overlook this.\n\n202\n00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:17.370\nI get a lot of emails from people saying,\nhey Don, you did this in the show and\n\n203\n00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:18.520\nit's not working for me.\n\n204\n00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:23.140\nAnd this is the one that people usually\nmiss is, I chose my external hard drive.\n\n205\n00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:25.490\nI need to put my images on\nthat external hard drive.\n\n206\n00:09:25.490 --> 00:09:27.050\nWell, mine are already there.\n\n207\n00:09:27.050 --> 00:09:30.090\nIf I browse my external hard drive, right.\n\n208\n00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:33.590\nI made this folder called Install Images,\nand inside of Install Images,\n\n209\n00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:35.230\nhere's all the images we made on the show.\n\n210\n00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:38.700\nIf you've been watching all of\nour Building an Image episodes,\n\n211\n00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:40.622\nthese are the images we built, right.\n\n212\n00:09:40.622 --> 00:09:46.310\nCustomized OSX El Capitan, just a straight\nup NetInstall of OSX El Capitan,\n\n213\n00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:50.970\na package install of Virtualbox and\na net restore of my Mac Mini, right?\n\n214\n00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:52.490\nSo those are all one's we've built.\n\n215\n00:09:52.490 --> 00:09:55.290\nBut it's not gonna find these.\n\n216\n00:09:55.290 --> 00:09:58.550\nIf I start up my NetInstall\nserver it's gonna show no images.\n\n217\n00:09:58.550 --> 00:10:02.070\nAnd the reason is they've gotta\nbe in a very particular path.\n\n218\n00:10:02.070 --> 00:10:08.610\nThey've got to be in \\Library,\n\\Netboot, \\NetBootSP0.\n\n219\n00:10:08.610 --> 00:10:10.770\nThat's the folder that these\nthings have to be in, and\n\n220\n00:10:10.770 --> 00:10:12.690\nif they're not in that\nfolder it won't find them.\n\n221\n00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:15.040\nThat's the number one mistake people make.\n\n222\n00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:16.808\nClient data's the same thing.\n\n223\n00:10:16.808 --> 00:10:19.180\n\\Library, \\NetBoot, \\NetBootClients0.\n\n224\n00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:24.610\nSo those are the two different\nlocations that we want those to be.\n\n225\n00:10:24.610 --> 00:10:26.370\nBut I don't really have any client data.\n\n226\n00:10:26.370 --> 00:10:28.240\nI'm just dealing with my images and so\n\n227\n00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:30.700\nthat's the folder that\nI need to be aware of.\n\n228\n00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:35.090\nNow, when I say OK to that,\nit's now setup for my external hard drive.\n\n229\n00:10:35.090 --> 00:10:37.640\nWhen I start this thing up,\nit's going to see that folder or\n\n230\n00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:38.790\ncreate it if it's missing.\n\n231\n00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:40.870\nSo I don't have to go and\ncreate the folder although you can.\n\n232\n00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:43.020\nYou can go and create it if you want it,\nit doesn't really matter.\n\n233\n00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:44.810\nIt will create that for me.\n\n234\n00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:48.080\nThe next thing is,\nEnable Netinstall on, and\n\n235\n00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:50.720\nI get to pick what adapter I'm gonna use.\n\n236\n00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:56.080\nNow, notice the adapter that it shows in\nhere, USB 10/100/1000 LAN, well that's\n\n237\n00:10:56.080 --> 00:11:00.450\na USB network adapter I use when I plug\ninto the docking station in my office.\n\n238\n00:11:00.450 --> 00:11:04.520\nI'm here in the studio, that adapter's\nnot even there It's not gonna work.\n\n239\n00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:07.100\nI need to pick the adapter I wanna use.\n\n240\n00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:11.620\nAnd on a laptop, we have to be doubly\ncareful because you might have wireless,\n\n241\n00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:14.060\nas well as wired connections and\n\n242\n00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:15.990\nwe definitely wanna prefer\nthe wired connection.\n\n243\n00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:20.910\nSo, on my laptop, I've got a Thunderbolt\nethernet adapter plugged in.\n\n244\n00:11:20.910 --> 00:11:23.120\nThat's gonna give me the best\nconnection I can have.\n\n245\n00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:26.320\nI'm gonna check that off and\nsee how they're both lit up.\n\n246\n00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:28.900\nNow my laptop can respond\neither one of these.\n\n247\n00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:30.640\nI let people connect on either one.\n\n248\n00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:32.940\nWell, I'm gonna turn off that USB one.\n\n249\n00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:36.810\nI'm only gonna serve up NetInstall\nfrom my Thunderbolt adapter.\n\n250\n00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:37.870\nRight.\nWe need to make sure we choose\n\n251\n00:11:37.870 --> 00:11:38.520\nthe right one there.\n\n252\n00:11:40.690 --> 00:11:44.440\nAll right, then we can restrict access\nto the images If you've got an image,\n\n253\n00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:47.070\nI think I gave an example of\nthis in the last episode,\n\n254\n00:11:47.070 --> 00:11:50.380\nlet's say I've got an image of my laptop.\n\n255\n00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:53.710\nI don't want just anybody in the company\ndownloading and installing my image and so\n\n256\n00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:57.190\nwe saw where in the image we can\nbuild in Mac address filters and so\n\n257\n00:11:57.190 --> 00:11:59.050\non to control who gets that access.\n\n258\n00:11:59.050 --> 00:12:04.700\nI can also restrict it here by limiting\nMac addresses to the server itself.\n\n259\n00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:07.730\nThis is effective, not for stopping\nsomebody getting to one image cuz it\n\n260\n00:12:07.730 --> 00:12:11.220\ndoesn't let me pick an image here, but for\nstopping people from seeing the server.\n\n261\n00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:15.410\nYou wouldn't want somebody from\noutside of your company to come in,\n\n262\n00:12:15.410 --> 00:12:18.780\nspin up a virtual machine,\nboot the VM from the network,\n\n263\n00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:21.630\nsee your net install server,\nand install one of your images.\n\n264\n00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:23.630\nCuz you might have licensed software.\n\n265\n00:12:23.630 --> 00:12:25.240\nThat they now have a copy of.\n\n266\n00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:28.570\nSo I could limit it just to MAC\naddresses from within my company, and\n\n267\n00:12:28.570 --> 00:12:29.510\nwe could set that up and say,\n\n268\n00:12:29.510 --> 00:12:32.180\nthese are the only people that are allowed\nto see this Netinstall server.\n\n269\n00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:34.760\nIt takes a lot of work, you gotta\npunch in a lot of MAC addresses, and\n\n270\n00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:36.410\nnobody wants to do that,\nbut it certainly does work.\n\n271\n00:12:38.285 --> 00:12:41.135\nSo I'm gonna leave mine unrestricted\nthere and then my images.\n\n272\n00:12:41.135 --> 00:12:43.915\nAnd right now I've got no images\navailable, and I'm okay with that.\n\n273\n00:12:43.915 --> 00:12:45.465\nSo that's what we've got.\n\n274\n00:12:45.465 --> 00:12:47.095\nI kind of have my settings in place.\n\n275\n00:12:47.095 --> 00:12:51.465\nThere's not really anything else that I\nneed to customize on it, and I can go and\n\n276\n00:12:51.465 --> 00:12:52.775\nturn it on.\n\n277\n00:12:52.775 --> 00:12:54.815\nNow when I go and turn it on,\nsee the message I got?\n\n278\n00:12:54.815 --> 00:12:58.971\nTo start NetInstall you must have at\nleast one image available to access by\n\n279\n00:12:58.971 --> 00:13:02.220\nmyClients and\nI don't have any images right now.\n\n280\n00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:04.900\nSo the server fails and\nit doesn't start, right?\n\n281\n00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:10.500\nSo I need to go and get an image put\nin and so I can browse my external SSD.\n\n282\n00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:13.860\nAnd notice on my external SSD,\nI've got a library folder now.\n\n283\n00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:16.350\nI didn't have that a moment ago.\n\n284\n00:13:16.350 --> 00:13:18.840\nAnd if I expand that\nout there's NetBoot And\n\n285\n00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:22.380\nthe NetBoot SP0 made the folder for me.\n\n286\n00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:26.220\nAnd so I'm gonna take all of my\ninstall images from earlier and\n\n287\n00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:28.880\nI'm just gonna drag them and\ndrop them right down in NetBoot.\n\n288\n00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:31.110\nActually, shoot, I'll do it, whatever.\n\n289\n00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:36.090\nSo that virtual box package,\nthat's a just a package installer,\n\n290\n00:13:36.090 --> 00:13:39.940\nI can't netboot off of that,\nthere's no operating system behind it and\n\n291\n00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:43.180\nI can't really deploy it that way so\nthere's not any point in me moving it in\n\n292\n00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:45.560\nhere, so\nI might as well get that out of there.\n\n293\n00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:49.010\nSo I'll just put that back up here.\n\n294\n00:13:49.010 --> 00:13:50.920\nThere we go.\nI just don't wanna confuse the system.\n\n295\n00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:55.610\nSo I've got my customized OS 10 installer,\n\n296\n00:13:55.610 --> 00:14:00.220\nI got my stock OS 10 installer and\nI've got that net restore image of\n\n297\n00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:03.700\nthe lab Mac meetings so\nthose are all right in that boot SP0.\n\n298\n00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:09.180\nNow when I get back to server\nIt doesn't show those images.\n\n299\n00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:11.230\nAnd there's a few ways we\ncan get them to show up.\n\n300\n00:14:11.230 --> 00:14:14.940\nWe can exit the server and\ncome back in and it'll do it.\n\n301\n00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:18.690\nBut there's actually a little\nfeature somewhere in here,\n\n302\n00:14:18.690 --> 00:14:20.120\nI think it's undocumented actually.\n\n303\n00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:21.380\nYeah, it's not up here in the Windows.\n\n304\n00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:24.660\nBut Cmd+R Is a keyboard\nshortcut we can hit.\n\n305\n00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:26.140\nIt's undocumented, we don't see it.\n\n306\n00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:30.135\nLike normally there's a View and Refresh,\nno, actually, there it is, View and\n\n307\n00:14:30.135 --> 00:14:30.649\nRefresh.\n\n308\n00:14:30.649 --> 00:14:34.072\n[LAUGH] All right, so\nwe can just go to View and Refresh.\n\n309\n00:14:34.072 --> 00:14:34.940\nIt would just Cmd+R.\n\n310\n00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:38.710\nI'm in the habit of just hitting\nCmd+R to make it refresh this screen.\n\n311\n00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:42.100\nAnd when you do that,\nit'll show those images.\n\n312\n00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:45.010\nAnd see how it automatically\nturned the server on for me.\n\n313\n00:14:45.010 --> 00:14:47.710\nbecause it know I tried to turn it\non earlier when I had no images.\n\n314\n00:14:47.710 --> 00:14:48.850\nNow it's going to turn it on for me.\n\n315\n00:14:48.850 --> 00:14:53.180\nNow you might think you're done, but\nthere is one more thing you need to do,\n\n316\n00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:56.100\nso I'm gonna turn this off really\nquick while I do my one more thing.\n\n317\n00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:59.460\nWhich is, we need to pick a default image.\n\n318\n00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:02.240\nWhen I power on a computer and\nI boot it from the network and\n\n319\n00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:06.790\nit sees my server It needs to have\na default image that it can go to.\n\n320\n00:15:06.790 --> 00:15:09.820\nThey can pick between the different\nimages that are available but\n\n321\n00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:11.580\nwhich one's gonna be the default?\n\n322\n00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:16.230\nAnd so, you can pick and maybe I want\nit to be my customized OS 10 installer.\n\n323\n00:15:16.230 --> 00:15:17.780\nI want that to be the default.\n\n324\n00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:20.980\nSo I can highlight that,\nhit my drop down box, and\n\n325\n00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:24.140\nI can choose Use as Default Boot Image.\n\n326\n00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:26.830\nAnd so I'm gonna do that,\nthat one's now my default.\n\n327\n00:15:26.830 --> 00:15:30.520\nNow visually, I don't really see any\ndifference there right if I refresh my\n\n328\n00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:32.190\nscreen it doesn't look any different.\n\n329\n00:15:32.190 --> 00:15:34.010\nSo it's something you\njust to remember to do.\n\n330\n00:15:34.010 --> 00:15:38.421\nRemember to set one as the default and\nthen that will be the default boot image.\n\n331\n00:15:38.421 --> 00:15:41.211\nAnd you can do a little bit\nmore like I can take this and\n\n332\n00:15:41.211 --> 00:15:45.209\nchoose Edit Image Settings and when I\ndo that it brings up another screen And\n\n333\n00:15:45.209 --> 00:15:49.078\nhere's where we can start to tweak\na little bit of the things that we saw in\n\n334\n00:15:49.078 --> 00:15:51.004\nthe system image manager, right.\n\n335\n00:15:51.004 --> 00:15:53.200\nRemember in the system image manager,\n\n336\n00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:58.220\nthe system image utility, when we built an\nimage It asked us to set an image index.\n\n337\n00:15:58.220 --> 00:15:59.087\nHere it is.\n\n338\n00:15:59.087 --> 00:16:02.455\nI give this one an image index of 5000 cuz\nI knew I was gonna host it on more than\n\n339\n00:16:02.455 --> 00:16:03.630\none server.\n\n340\n00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:05.760\nAnd that was just\nthe first number available.\n\n341\n00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:08.360\nI can edit that and change it if I want.\n\n342\n00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:11.310\nAnd so I can move it to a different\nnumber here after the fact.\n\n343\n00:16:11.310 --> 00:16:16.120\nYou can also restrict access\nto the individual image and\n\n344\n00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:17.590\nnow I can put MAC Addresses.\n\n345\n00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:18.860\nSo if it's a net restore for\n\n346\n00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:21.260\nmy laptop, here's where I\ncan put that MAC Address in.\n\n347\n00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:23.940\nSo if we didn't do with\nthe system image utility,\n\n348\n00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:26.800\nwe can do it right here on\nthe server after the fact.\n\n349\n00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:30.790\nAll right, and then we've also got\nwhat Mac model it's available to,\n\n350\n00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:33.310\nthat was another thing we saw\nin the system image utility.\n\n351\n00:16:33.310 --> 00:16:36.330\nAnd then how we wanna\nmake the file available.\n\n352\n00:16:36.330 --> 00:16:39.080\nWhen a client connects,\nthey've gotta download the image, and\n\n353\n00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:41.290\nthe default is to do it via HTTP.\n\n354\n00:16:41.290 --> 00:16:44.460\nWell, what if I have\nsensitive data in there?\n\n355\n00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:47.550\nIn theory, somebody with a network\nsniffer could capture the whole string\n\n356\n00:16:47.550 --> 00:16:51.460\ntransmission and reassemble it, and\nthey've now got an image of my computer.\n\n357\n00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:52.470\nThat's not good.\n\n358\n00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:55.570\nSo you can choose to use\nother protocols like NFS or\n\n359\n00:16:55.570 --> 00:17:00.210\nsomething to change the way\nthat's being transmitted.\n\n360\n00:17:00.210 --> 00:17:03.790\nNow, notice how I don't have\nHTTPS as an option here.\n\n361\n00:17:03.790 --> 00:17:06.500\nIf I enable certificates in my system,\nwhich I haven't done here,\n\n362\n00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:09.560\nit'll automatically do that and\nit'll start to use HTTPS.\n\n363\n00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:10.390\nBut by default,\n\n364\n00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:13.880\nit's got HTTP and NFS, neither of\nwhich are encrypted out of the box.\n\n365\n00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:17.230\nNow, NFS can be a little bit more\nefficient for transmitting files, but\n\n366\n00:17:17.230 --> 00:17:19.770\nHTTP passes through firewalls\na little bit more easily,\n\n367\n00:17:19.770 --> 00:17:22.240\ncuz most people don't open NFS ports.\n\n368\n00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:24.620\nBut I can choose that protocol\nthat it's gonna be available in.\n\n369\n00:17:24.620 --> 00:17:26.650\nI'll just leave mine HTTP for now.\n\n370\n00:17:26.650 --> 00:17:29.930\nAnother option is you can use like IPsec\nto secure all your communications,\n\n371\n00:17:29.930 --> 00:17:32.910\nbut you have problems when you\nboot somebody from the network,\n\n372\n00:17:32.910 --> 00:17:35.990\ngetting them to participate in IPsec, so\nthat's a little bit more of a challenge.\n\n373\n00:17:37.442 --> 00:17:41.350\nAll right, so I'm gonna go and say OK to\nthat and now I'm gonna turn this thing on,\n\n374\n00:17:41.350 --> 00:17:43.120\nI'm gonna try and turn this thing on.\n\n375\n00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:46.730\nThere we go, and\nnow I'm in NetInstall server.\n\n376\n00:17:46.730 --> 00:17:48.800\nI'm up and I'm serving this up.\n\n377\n00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:51.210\nI'm serving up on our studio network here,\nand so\n\n378\n00:17:51.210 --> 00:17:56.080\nif anybody in ITProTV studios right now\nwere to boot their Mac from network,\n\n379\n00:17:56.080 --> 00:18:01.855\nthey would see my laptop and they'd see\nthese three images they can install.\n\n380\n00:18:01.855 --> 00:18:05.350\nAndI mentioned earlier that visually\nwe couldn't really see which one was\n\n381\n00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:06.090\nthe default image.\n\n382\n00:18:06.090 --> 00:18:08.683\nBut I guess it was just off my screen\ncuz I can see that little note right\n\n383\n00:18:08.683 --> 00:18:09.412\nthere, default.\n\n384\n00:18:09.412 --> 00:18:12.702\nSo I can tell which one\nis the default now.\n\n385\n00:18:12.702 --> 00:18:15.640\nYeah, so guess it was just maybe my\nresolution was wrong or something.\n\n386\n00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:17.030\nSo it was off a little bit.\n\n387\n00:18:17.030 --> 00:18:19.000\nBut we got it there.\n\n388\n00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:19.560\nIt's up.\n\n389\n00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:20.840\nIt's good to go.\n\n390\n00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:22.230\nThe server's done.\n\n391\n00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:25.670\nSo now it's time for the fun part,\nwhich is to go to a client, and\n\n392\n00:18:25.670 --> 00:18:27.580\nget them to install this image.\n\n393\n00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:29.500\nAnd so I've got my Mac Mini here.\n\n394\n00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:32.424\nAnd in our last episode I deployed\na net restore image to it, so\n\n395\n00:18:32.424 --> 00:18:34.260\nit's got a customized install.\n\n396\n00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:35.244\nWe changed the wallpaper.\n\n397\n00:18:35.244 --> 00:18:38.230\nIt had CyberDoc and\nGoogle Chrome installed.\n\n398\n00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:42.780\nSo this is a computer that's out on the\nnetwork and let's say I put it in a lab\n\n399\n00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:45.260\nand some students used it and\nI just don't know what they did.\n\n400\n00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:51.560\nIt's all junky, they put their own stuff\non there, and I'm not happy with it.\n\n401\n00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:54.890\nSo I'm like, it's got Chrome and\nCyberDuck and all this other mess.\n\n402\n00:18:54.890 --> 00:18:56.840\nI wanna put it back to normal.\n\n403\n00:18:56.840 --> 00:19:02.016\nWell, I can use my NetInstall\nserver to roll out our customized\n\n404\n00:19:02.016 --> 00:19:06.912\nNetInstall of OSX El Capitan,\nand get it set nice and neat.\n\n405\n00:19:06.912 --> 00:19:10.750\nRight, so, what I need to do first off,\nis shut this machine down.\n\n406\n00:19:10.750 --> 00:19:12.290\nAll right, so I'm gonna shut it down.\n\n407\n00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:17.710\nAnd once it shut down,\nwe're gonna boot it from network.\n\n408\n00:19:17.710 --> 00:19:21.490\nNow, when I boot it from USB,\nremember how we booted up and\n\n409\n00:19:21.490 --> 00:19:24.090\nthen hold the Alt key on the keyboard?\n\n410\n00:19:24.090 --> 00:19:25.470\nOr when we went into target mode.\n\n411\n00:19:25.470 --> 00:19:26.427\nThat's fun.\n\n412\n00:19:26.427 --> 00:19:30.580\nSo, when I went into target mode,\nwe had to hold T on the keyboard.\n\n413\n00:19:30.580 --> 00:19:32.900\nWell this time I wanna boot\nin the network mode and so\n\n414\n00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:35.450\nI'm gonna hold N on the keyboard.\n\n415\n00:19:35.450 --> 00:19:39.020\nWhen it boots up we'll know it works,\nif we see a little glow, but\n\n416\n00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:42.160\nif you see the Apple logo then\nit might not be right, but\n\n417\n00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:44.110\nif you see a little flashing glow,\nthere it is.\n\n418\n00:19:44.110 --> 00:19:47.660\nIt's flashing and that let's us now\nthat it's reaching element network.\n\n419\n00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:50.100\nAnd it's looking for our server.\n\n420\n00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:54.670\nNow, when it finds a server, it's actually\nusing a little protocol in the background\n\n421\n00:19:54.670 --> 00:19:58.680\nwhich is the Boot Service Discovery\nProtocol or BSDP or something like that.\n\n422\n00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:00.411\nBut it's got this little\nprotocol that it uses.\n\n423\n00:20:00.411 --> 00:20:04.695\nIt reaches out and tries to find that\nsystem on the network to boot up, and\n\n424\n00:20:04.695 --> 00:20:08.994\nyou'll know it finds it if it switches and\nshows the Apple logo, right.\n\n425\n00:20:08.994 --> 00:20:11.469\nNow you can take a little while for\nphysical machine like this, so\n\n426\n00:20:11.469 --> 00:20:12.911\nlet me jump over to a virtual machine.\n\n427\n00:20:12.911 --> 00:20:15.490\nI'll show you it's a little faster on VM,\nright, from my laptop here.\n\n428\n00:20:15.490 --> 00:20:18.760\nSo I'm going to take a VM and\nI'm basically going to do the same thing.\n\n429\n00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:21.452\nI'm going to start this up and\nI'm going to hold M on my keyboard.\n\n430\n00:20:21.452 --> 00:20:23.330\nAnd so here I see VMWare booting up and\n\n431\n00:20:23.330 --> 00:20:27.388\nI get a little message up there letting\nme know it's doing EFI Network boot, and\n\n432\n00:20:27.388 --> 00:20:31.090\nit's going to look for my NetInstall\nserver and it's going to find it.\n\n433\n00:20:31.090 --> 00:20:32.580\nSo I'll see that little glow flash, but\n\n434\n00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:36.040\nit's going to happen way faster\nbecause it's right here on my laptop.\n\n435\n00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:39.390\nSo see how the globe isn't flashing\nanymore, now it's spinning?\n\n436\n00:20:39.390 --> 00:20:41.411\nAnd I get the Apple logo.\n\n437\n00:20:41.411 --> 00:20:45.630\nIt's found the NetInstall server at this\npoint, and it's reaching out to it and\n\n438\n00:20:45.630 --> 00:20:50.048\nsaying hey can you please give me some\nkind of operating system to boot.\n\n439\n00:20:50.048 --> 00:20:51.960\nAnd the NetInstall\nserver's gonna say sure,\n\n440\n00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:56.310\nhere, let me give you a smaller\nversion of Mac OS that you can boot.\n\n441\n00:20:56.310 --> 00:20:58.820\nIt's basically the recovery\nconsole is what it's giving it.\n\n442\n00:20:58.820 --> 00:21:02.590\nSo it's 6 or\n700 megs of data that it's gonna transmit.\n\n443\n00:21:02.590 --> 00:21:05.630\nSo we can sit here and\nwait while it transmitted those 6 or\n\n444\n00:21:05.630 --> 00:21:11.660\n700 megs of data and once that was done,\nit would boot into the kind of recovery.\n\n445\n00:21:11.660 --> 00:21:13.860\nNow the recoveries are little\nbit more automated though.\n\n446\n00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:15.590\nAnd so what's gonna happen\nthis is gonna boot up and\n\n447\n00:21:15.590 --> 00:21:19.126\nit's gonna say, hey NetInstall server,\nwhat's your default image?\n\n448\n00:21:19.126 --> 00:21:22.860\nAnd the install server's gonna say,\nyeah default image, no problem,\n\n449\n00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:25.970\nI've got that right here and\nit's gonna start downloading.\n\n450\n00:21:25.970 --> 00:21:28.950\nSo I've got another virtual machine\nthat's kinda parked at that stage.\n\n451\n00:21:28.950 --> 00:21:29.869\nSo this is what you'll see.\n\n452\n00:21:29.869 --> 00:21:33.980\nAnd once it's at the point,\nit's installing, right?\n\n453\n00:21:33.980 --> 00:21:36.820\nSo it's grabbing that default image and\n\n454\n00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:39.740\nit's starting to install it, and\nprovision it, right here on the machine.\n\n455\n00:21:39.740 --> 00:21:42.590\nSo it's now downloading\nright over the network.\n\n456\n00:21:42.590 --> 00:21:47.827\nAnd I didn't have to use a,\nlet me go back here.\n\n457\n00:21:47.827 --> 00:21:50.600\nI didn't have to use a USB key or\nanything like that.\n\n458\n00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:53.950\nIt just happened right over the network\nfrom holding N while I booted.\n\n459\n00:21:53.950 --> 00:21:55.640\nSo if I go back to my\nNetInstall server and\n\n460\n00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:58.000\nI jump over to the Connections tab,\nthere it is.\n\n461\n00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:59.380\nI can see I've got a connection.\n\n462\n00:21:59.380 --> 00:22:03.210\nit says Mac.local cuz it's one of\nmy virtual machines connected.\n\n463\n00:22:03.210 --> 00:22:08.820\nThe status is NetInstall and the current\nprogress is 0% so it's not very far along.\n\n464\n00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:10.310\nBut it's gonna start transmitting.\n\n465\n00:22:10.310 --> 00:22:14.466\nNow my image, I don't remember how big\nmy image is it was like nine gigs or\n\n466\n00:22:14.466 --> 00:22:15.911\n15 gigs or something.\n\n467\n00:22:15.911 --> 00:22:20.202\nSo it's gonna have to transmit 9 gigs\nof data across the data to that client.\n\n468\n00:22:20.202 --> 00:22:22.988\nOn a fast network that can\nhappen in a manner of minutes,\n\n469\n00:22:22.988 --> 00:22:27.260\nnormally it's gonna take or like an hour\nor maybe even longer, but I don't care.\n\n470\n00:22:27.260 --> 00:22:29.080\nI let it run and I walk away.\n\n471\n00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:30.400\nI go to the next machine.\n\n472\n00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:33.630\nSo if I have a thousand Macs\nthat I need to image like this,\n\n473\n00:22:33.630 --> 00:22:37.100\nI just boot each one of them while\nholding N on the keyboard and\n\n474\n00:22:37.100 --> 00:22:39.620\nthen I walk away, and\nit's gonna install the default image.\n\n475\n00:22:39.620 --> 00:22:43.410\nWhatever I have flagged as a default\nright now is what's going to install, and\n\n476\n00:22:43.410 --> 00:22:46.560\nI can activate all 1,000 of them and\nthey all start imaging.\n\n477\n00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:50.920\nAnd it might take a few hours, but I don't\ncare, I'm in the break room relaxing.\n\n478\n00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:53.590\n>> One of the things that I\nwas gonna ask on this, Don.\n\n479\n00:22:53.590 --> 00:22:57.200\nWould you be then pretty much just\nlimited by how much bandwidth you have on\n\n480\n00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:57.880\nyour network?\n\n481\n00:22:57.880 --> 00:22:59.320\nWould that be the bottleneck?\n\n482\n00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:02.030\n>> Yeah, bandwidth is definitely\nan issue on this one.\n\n483\n00:23:02.030 --> 00:23:05.750\nThat as you start transmitting these\nimages, the more simultaneous machines you\n\n484\n00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:08.890\nhave going at once, the more that\nbandwidth is getting divided up.\n\n485\n00:23:08.890 --> 00:23:10.980\nAnd that can hurt the system a little bit.\n\n486\n00:23:10.980 --> 00:23:13.730\nSo performance-wise,\nyou don't normally wanna do a ton.\n\n487\n00:23:13.730 --> 00:23:15.980\nYou wouldn't wanna do 1,000 at once.\n\n488\n00:23:15.980 --> 00:23:18.365\nNow there are some third-party\ntechnologies out there that can do\n\n489\n00:23:18.365 --> 00:23:19.320\nmulti-casting.\n\n490\n00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:22.770\nWhich means you send the image once and\nit goes to multiple machines.\n\n491\n00:23:22.770 --> 00:23:25.550\nBut by default,\nthe NetInstall server doesn't do that.\n\n492\n00:23:25.550 --> 00:23:28.720\nIt's sending one dedicated\nstream to each client.\n\n493\n00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:31.850\nCuz each client might be at a different\nstatus point of that install.\n\n494\n00:23:31.850 --> 00:23:35.060\nYou might have some people that are 5%\ndone, some people that are 20% done.\n\n495\n00:23:35.060 --> 00:23:37.080\nSo they're getting different bits, and\n\n496\n00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:39.050\nthe third-party software has\nways that it works around that.\n\n497\n00:23:39.050 --> 00:23:41.140\nBut here, we would definitely\nneed to worry about bandwidth.\n\n498\n00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:44.609\nAll right, but at that point,\nour NetInstall server is up,\n\n499\n00:23:44.609 --> 00:23:45.587\nit's serving the image.\n\n500\n00:23:45.587 --> 00:23:48.835\nAnd if we wanted this to be a really long\nepisode, we could sit here for an hour and\n\n501\n00:23:48.835 --> 00:23:49.962\nwait for that VM to finish.\n\n502\n00:23:49.962 --> 00:23:52.796\nBut when it's done,\nit's no different than the USB key.\n\n503\n00:23:52.796 --> 00:23:54.003\nIt reboots.\n\n504\n00:23:54.003 --> 00:23:55.921\nAnd now it's in that operating system.\n\n505\n00:23:55.921 --> 00:23:59.573\nSo the cool thing here is if you\nget a NetInstall server setup,\n\n506\n00:23:59.573 --> 00:24:02.100\nyou can turn it on,\nget it put in place, and\n\n507\n00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:06.570\nthen anytime you're troubleshooting\na computer, what, what?\n\n508\n00:24:06.570 --> 00:24:07.660\nI used to work for an insurance company.\n\n509\n00:24:07.660 --> 00:24:09.170\nWe had this 30 minute rule.\n\n510\n00:24:09.170 --> 00:24:10.930\nYou'd go to a client's machine.\n\n511\n00:24:10.930 --> 00:24:13.590\nAnd if you couldn't fix\nthe problem in 30 minutes,\n\n512\n00:24:13.590 --> 00:24:15.496\nif 30 minutes went by, that was enough.\n\n513\n00:24:15.496 --> 00:24:17.680\nYou re-image the machine.\n\n514\n00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:21.120\nAnd so you'd spend your 30 minutes\ntroubleshooting trying to solve it, and\n\n515\n00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:24.609\nthen at the end of 30 minutes if the\nproblem wasn't solved, shut the computer\n\n516\n00:24:24.609 --> 00:24:28.120\ndown, you boot it up while holding the N\nkey, and you picked our company image.\n\n517\n00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:32.222\nAnd it would re-image that machine,\nwhich would take another 30 minutes, and\n\n518\n00:24:32.222 --> 00:24:35.314\nthen within an hour,\nthat computer was backup and running and\n\n519\n00:24:35.314 --> 00:24:37.590\nthe people are ready to hop into it and\nuse it.\n\n520\n00:24:37.590 --> 00:24:40.407\nI know what you're thinking, what about\nthe user data that was on the computer?\n\n521\n00:24:40.407 --> 00:24:44.229\nWell it's gone and so we have a very\nsimple rule in the company where we said,\n\n522\n00:24:44.229 --> 00:24:47.880\ndon't store data on your own computer,\nit doesn't get backed up.\n\n523\n00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:51.493\nYou've got to store to our network shares,\nyou've got to store it in company approved\n\n524\n00:24:51.493 --> 00:24:53.534\nlocations, otherwise\nyou're at risk of data.\n\n525\n00:24:53.534 --> 00:24:56.087\nAnd that really shortened\nour troubleshooting time and\n\n526\n00:24:56.087 --> 00:24:59.669\nour troubleshooting tickets, that we knew\nno matter how bad a problem was with\n\n527\n00:24:59.669 --> 00:25:03.488\nsomebody's computer, we could always have\nthem back up and going within an hour.\n\n528\n00:25:03.488 --> 00:25:05.125\nAnd so the help desk was\nreally proficient at that.\n\n529\n00:25:05.125 --> 00:25:07.669\nThose guys can get out there\nan knock out those problems,\n\n530\n00:25:07.669 --> 00:25:09.688\nNetInstall was kind of\nthe key piece of that.\n\n531\n00:25:09.688 --> 00:25:13.234\nAnd you have similar concepts\nover in Windows and other areas I\n\n532\n00:25:13.234 --> 00:25:17.500\ndo wanna show you just a little bit of\nthe behind the scenes of NetInstall.\n\n533\n00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:19.560\nSo let's jump back into my\nServer Manger real quick.\n\n534\n00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:22.281\nLet me get rid of some of this\nother stuff I've got open.\n\n535\n00:25:22.281 --> 00:25:28.360\nAnd in the NetInstall system,\nif I go back up here to Logs,\n\n536\n00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:32.020\ninside of the logs you can filter\nthe logs that you're viewing.\n\n537\n00:25:32.020 --> 00:25:34.140\nAnd see how I can get my System log,\nand Caching,\n\n538\n00:25:34.140 --> 00:25:36.770\nand so on, you've also got\nyour NetInstall service log.\n\n539\n00:25:36.770 --> 00:25:41.620\nNow, this service log is the same log\nused by a lot of the other services.\n\n540\n00:25:41.620 --> 00:25:44.430\nAnd so, just because I'm choosing\nNetInstall service log doesn't mean I'm\n\n541\n00:25:44.430 --> 00:25:46.260\nonly going to see NetInstall.\n\n542\n00:25:46.260 --> 00:25:49.595\nAnd you'll notice that, because you'll see\na few places up here where we get like\n\n543\n00:25:49.595 --> 00:25:55.020\nnon-NetInstall stuff, which I say,\nbut I'm not actually seeing.\n\n544\n00:25:55.020 --> 00:25:57.570\nEverything here seems to\nbe NetInstall related.\n\n545\n00:25:57.570 --> 00:26:01.800\nBut what I wanted to point out is that\nyou can see right here in the background,\n\n546\n00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:05.230\nthat it's using bootp, the bootp daemon.\n\n547\n00:26:05.230 --> 00:26:07.002\nAnd that's the bootstrap protocol.\n\n548\n00:26:07.002 --> 00:26:10.184\nAnd Wes, you asked earlier,\nis this standards based stuff?\n\n549\n00:26:10.184 --> 00:26:11.640\nAnd the answer is yes.\n\n550\n00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:17.140\nBehind the scenes, it is bootp and that\nis a standard, pixie type boot solution,\n\n551\n00:26:17.140 --> 00:26:21.750\nbut where it gets different\nis this guy right here, BSDP.\n\n552\n00:26:22.930 --> 00:26:25.350\nThat's that\nBoot Service Discovery Protocol.\n\n553\n00:26:25.350 --> 00:26:29.390\nAnd so when your Mac boots up,\nit's using Bonjour and\n\n554\n00:26:29.390 --> 00:26:32.580\nother protocols like that to\nfind the NetInstall server.\n\n555\n00:26:32.580 --> 00:26:36.490\nAnd so\nhere I'm getting this BSDP messages.\n\n556\n00:26:36.490 --> 00:26:40.590\nAnd those are clients that are looking for\nme and I'm responding.\n\n557\n00:26:40.590 --> 00:26:46.480\nHere's a BSDP INFORM, BSDP DISCOVER,\nthat's a client trying to find me.\n\n558\n00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:52.330\nAnd then BSDP INFORM, that's me\ntelling them, hey, I'm available.\n\n559\n00:26:52.330 --> 00:26:53.850\nI've got some images.\n\n560\n00:26:53.850 --> 00:26:55.290\nWould you like one?\n\n561\n00:26:55.290 --> 00:26:56.850\nAnd then offering it up, right?\n\n562\n00:26:56.850 --> 00:27:00.220\nSo that BSDP DISCOVER inform is important.\n\n563\n00:27:00.220 --> 00:27:02.360\nAnd notice how I've got\nmore than one inform.\n\n564\n00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:05.370\nWell, if I look at it, those informs\nare all going to the same client.\n\n565\n00:27:05.370 --> 00:27:07.690\nSo I must have had some\nkind of connectivity issue,\n\n566\n00:27:07.690 --> 00:27:10.060\nwhere it had to send\nthe inform more than once.\n\n567\n00:27:10.060 --> 00:27:14.730\nThese informs are sent as broadcasts and\nso they could get blocked or\n\n568\n00:27:14.730 --> 00:27:16.740\nstopped or whatever and\nnot make it to the other side.\n\n569\n00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:19.225\nAnd so we can then switch and\ntry as unicast.\n\n570\n00:27:19.225 --> 00:27:23.300\nWhen the image is transmitted, the image\nis being transmitted as a unicast.\n\n571\n00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:27.730\nSo you'll here where there is\nthe BSDP acknowledging list.\n\n572\n00:27:27.730 --> 00:27:29.450\nAnd then acknowledging select.\n\n573\n00:27:29.450 --> 00:27:32.530\nThe list, that's where we're giving\nthe list of images that we've got.\n\n574\n00:27:32.530 --> 00:27:33.940\nAnd then select, that's where it picks.\n\n575\n00:27:33.940 --> 00:27:37.610\nNow, when you boot a Mac from the network,\nby default, it picks the default image.\n\n576\n00:27:37.610 --> 00:27:39.890\nSo I never actually saw\na list on the screen.\n\n577\n00:27:39.890 --> 00:27:42.340\nIt just said, I'm gonna take\nthe default and run with it.\n\n578\n00:27:42.340 --> 00:27:43.570\nAnd so that's what it did.\n\n579\n00:27:43.570 --> 00:27:45.210\nAnd it's now deploying and running.\n\n580\n00:27:45.210 --> 00:27:47.310\nBut you can see some other things\nin here which are useful for\n\n581\n00:27:47.310 --> 00:27:51.250\ntroubleshooting, like all the different\ninterfaces that I've got on my computer.\n\n582\n00:27:51.250 --> 00:27:53.970\nRemember how I enabled it for\nmy Thunderbolt interface,\n\n583\n00:27:53.970 --> 00:27:55.200\nthis guy right here?\n\n584\n00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:57.940\nBut it does see my other interfaces,\nand I could turn those on or\n\n585\n00:27:57.940 --> 00:28:00.500\noff as needed to serve this up.\n\n586\n00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:02.510\nBut this is a great way\nto troubleshoot and\n\n587\n00:28:02.510 --> 00:28:05.430\nfind out if a client's not connecting,\nwhy not?\n\n588\n00:28:05.430 --> 00:28:07.280\nAm I even seeing it here on the server?\n\n589\n00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:09.830\nMaybe they're not even\nmaking it to the server and\n\n590\n00:28:09.830 --> 00:28:11.740\nI don't see the communication here, right?\n\n591\n00:28:11.740 --> 00:28:14.710\nSo that can certainly happen and\nthis is a great place to go for that,\n\n592\n00:28:14.710 --> 00:28:16.450\nthe troubleshooting side.\n\n593\n00:28:16.450 --> 00:28:19.917\nBut you've also got your connection\nscreen, so when you go under NetInstall,\n\n594\n00:28:19.917 --> 00:28:21.300\nwhere'd my NetInstall go?\n\n595\n00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:22.020\nHere.\n\n596\n00:28:22.020 --> 00:28:24.160\nWhen you go into NetInstall, you can\ngo and view those connections,, and\n\n597\n00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:27.010\nyou can see each person that's connected\nand how much data they've transferred.\n\n598\n00:28:27.010 --> 00:28:29.770\nSo that's another way to verify\nthat your system is working, and\n\n599\n00:28:29.770 --> 00:28:31.550\ntransmitting, right.\n\n600\n00:28:31.550 --> 00:28:33.050\nNot to mention just\nwatching on the client.\n\n601\n00:28:33.050 --> 00:28:35.780\nCuz you'll see that status bar crawling\nalong right on that client site.\n\n602\n00:28:37.110 --> 00:28:41.520\nAll right, so as far as NetInstall goes,\nsetting up the server is pretty easy.\n\n603\n00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:43.770\nGetting clients connected\nto it's pretty easy.\n\n604\n00:28:43.770 --> 00:28:45.910\nIt's really just a matter of\nthrowing those images in there.\n\n605\n00:28:45.910 --> 00:28:49.370\nSo, great solution,\nit does require the server apps so\n\n606\n00:28:49.370 --> 00:28:52.480\nwe got to make sure we go to our\nApp Store, buy that, and install it, and\n\n607\n00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:54.870\nthen after that it's just a matter\nof flipping a few switches.\n\n608\n00:28:54.870 --> 00:28:57.540\n>> Great information that we've\nseen in our Mac management basics,\n\n609\n00:28:57.540 --> 00:29:00.390\nremember today we we're at looking at how\nyou can deploy an image and not being\n\n610\n00:29:00.390 --> 00:29:04.230\nrestricted to the physical media, and\nit can make mass deployments a lot easier.\n\n611\n00:29:04.230 --> 00:29:05.400\nDon, thank you for that information.\n\n612\n00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:06.695\nAnd do you got anything else for\nus in this one?\n\n613\n00:29:06.695 --> 00:29:09.269\n>> One more thing worth mentioning,\n\n614\n00:29:09.269 --> 00:29:13.500\nwhen I booted that Mac Mini,\nI held N on the keyboard.\n\n615\n00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:16.090\nAnd that's usually the one\nthat shows up on the exam.\n\n616\n00:29:16.090 --> 00:29:18.230\nBut there is one other way to do it.\n\n617\n00:29:18.230 --> 00:29:22.240\nIf you've got a NetInstall server on your\nnetwork and you boot a virtual machine,\n\n618\n00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:25.850\nyou can actually go into your\nstartup disks system preference.\n\n619\n00:29:25.850 --> 00:29:29.739\nAnd once you're in there, if there's\na NetInstall system on the network,\n\n620\n00:29:29.739 --> 00:29:32.253\nit will see it,\nit will show up as a start up disk.\n\n621\n00:29:32.253 --> 00:29:36.370\nI'm actually restoring, let me take\none of these VMs and roll it back.\n\n622\n00:29:36.370 --> 00:29:38.330\nI'm formatting my virtual machine.\n\n623\n00:29:38.330 --> 00:29:39.670\nSo it's kinda hard for me to show it here.\n\n624\n00:29:39.670 --> 00:29:42.350\nBut let me roll this one back and\nI'll show you real quick.\n\n625\n00:29:42.350 --> 00:29:47.480\nWhen you go into one of the start up\ndisks, you can pick the NetInstall\n\n626\n00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:51.280\nfrom there, and then you don't have to\nworry about holding N on your keyboard,\n\n627\n00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:55.800\nso if I'm sitting on my laptop, or\nI could probably go to Wes' laptop for\n\n628\n00:29:55.800 --> 00:29:59.120\nthat matter, and\nwhen I go into his startup discs,\n\n629\n00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:03.490\nhe should see my NetInstall server and\nthen be able to pick it and run with that.\n\n630\n00:30:03.490 --> 00:30:07.210\nSo let me just fire this one up here and\nI'll show you once it's booted.\n\n631\n00:30:07.210 --> 00:30:11.050\nNow, obviously it expects to be able to\nfind the NetInstall system on the network.\n\n632\n00:30:11.050 --> 00:30:14.030\nSo I need to be on the same\nsubnet as the NetInstall server,\n\n633\n00:30:14.030 --> 00:30:15.680\notherwise I'm not gonna find it.\n\n634\n00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:18.710\nBut once I find it,\nit'll just show up automatically.\n\n635\n00:30:18.710 --> 00:30:21.630\nSo that's another way that that\ncould show up on the exams.\n\n636\n00:30:21.630 --> 00:30:23.913\nSo I can boot it and hold N, right?\n\n637\n00:30:23.913 --> 00:30:26.818\nWell, before the Apple shows\nup I could have held N and\n\n638\n00:30:26.818 --> 00:30:29.150\ntold it to boot from network.\n\n639\n00:30:29.150 --> 00:30:33.620\nBut if I'm remoting into this machine, if\nI'm providing remote connectivity support,\n\n640\n00:30:33.620 --> 00:30:36.070\nI'd have to tell the end user,\nhey, can you do me a favor?\n\n641\n00:30:36.070 --> 00:30:40.420\nTurn your machine off and\nhold N on your keyboard and press Power.\n\n642\n00:30:40.420 --> 00:30:42.650\nSome end users can do that, some can't.\n\n643\n00:30:42.650 --> 00:30:46.900\nSo if I'm remoted into it, I can just go\ninto the Startup Disk System Preference\n\n644\n00:30:46.900 --> 00:30:48.720\nand tell it to boot from\nthe NetBoot server.\n\n645\n00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:51.470\nAnd then I could reboot it and\nthat would save me a lot of time.\n\n646\n00:30:51.470 --> 00:30:54.443\nThat's kind of an artsy little [LAUGH].\n\n647\n00:30:54.443 --> 00:30:55.291\nThere we go.\n\n648\n00:30:55.291 --> 00:30:59.180\nSo let me get logged into this one and\nwe'll see how fast this goes.\n\n649\n00:30:59.180 --> 00:31:00.970\nAnd I gotta make sure I’m\non the right network too.\n\n650\n00:31:00.970 --> 00:31:02.360\nLet me get on the right network.\n\n651\n00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:02.990\nThat’s the other thing,\n\n652\n00:31:02.990 --> 00:31:07.840\nI said I needed to be on the same network\nas that server, or it doesn’t work, right?\n\n653\n00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:12.620\nSo, I’m just gonna verify that\nI’m on the right network and\n\n654\n00:31:12.620 --> 00:31:14.880\nthen we'll be able to verify and\nget that working.\n\n655\n00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:18.369\nSo, if I check my IP address.\n\n656\n00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:21.850\nI am on the 10.1.230 network.\n\n657\n00:31:21.850 --> 00:31:22.350\nPerfect.\n\n658\n00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:26.340\nAnd now that I'm on that network,\n\n659\n00:31:26.340 --> 00:31:29.490\nI should just be able to go up\nto my System Preferences, and\n\n660\n00:31:29.490 --> 00:31:32.710\nin System Preference I can go to my\nstartup disks whenever it comes up.\n\n661\n00:31:33.810 --> 00:31:38.400\nAnd once I'm in my startup disk,\n\n662\n00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:43.040\nhere's where it's got Macintosh HD and\nlook what's showing up here.\n\n663\n00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:49.230\nWhen I boot holding N on my keyboard,\nit boots and installs the default image.\n\n664\n00:31:49.230 --> 00:31:52.820\nBut here, I see all of my images.\n\n665\n00:31:52.820 --> 00:31:56.590\nAnd so, I've got the NetRestore for\nmy lab Mac Mini.\n\n666\n00:31:56.590 --> 00:31:57.780\nI could choose that one.\n\n667\n00:31:57.780 --> 00:32:00.650\nI've got the El Capitan,\n\n668\n00:32:00.650 --> 00:32:04.950\nthis is the regular clean install, and\nthen here's the customized install.\n\n669\n00:32:04.950 --> 00:32:06.428\nAnd so I can unlock that.\n\n670\n00:32:08.506 --> 00:32:11.750\nAnd maybe I'll wanna do\nthat lab Mac Mini restore.\n\n671\n00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:14.670\nAnd so I can come in and\nI can choose that one.\n\n672\n00:32:14.670 --> 00:32:18.200\nAnd now when I hit Restart, it's gonna\nboot off the network automatically and\n\n673\n00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:19.520\nit's gonna load that image.\n\n674\n00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:21.370\nSo this is where the list comes in.\n\n675\n00:32:21.370 --> 00:32:23.050\nWhen you hold N, you don't see the list.\n\n676\n00:32:23.050 --> 00:32:24.760\nWhen you do it this way,\nyou do see the list.\n\n677\n00:32:24.760 --> 00:32:27.740\n>> Great information on\nMac management basics.\n\n678\n00:32:27.740 --> 00:32:28.986\nBut stick around with us,\n\n679\n00:32:28.986 --> 00:32:32.340\nbecause we got more episodes coming\nup with a lot more content in them.\n\n680\n00:32:32.340 --> 00:32:34.400\nBut we're gonna go ahead and\nsave that for the next episode.\n\n681\n00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:37.124\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nsign off here at ITproTV.\n\n682\n00:32:37.124 --> 00:32:39.470\nI've been your host Wes Bryan-\n>> And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n683\n00:32:39.470 --> 00:32:41.469\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n684\n00:32:41.469 -->

00:00:16.590\n>> I'm your host, Wes Bryan and\n\n4\n00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.730\nin this episode we're gonna be continuing\nalong with our Mac Management basics.\n\n5\n00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:21.960\n>> And we got none other than Mr.\n\n6\n00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.630\nDon Pezet here to help us out,\nDon, how you doing today, sir?\n\n7\n00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:25.330\n>> I'm doing great\n\n8\n00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:27.840\nWes ready to jump right back into\nthe world of Mac Management Basics.\n\n9\n00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.200\nAnd in this episode,\n\n10\n00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:33.060\nI'm kind of excited cuz this is the first\ntime that we're truly managing something.\n\n11\n00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:38.880\nWe spent so many episodes now talking\nabout ways that we can deploy systems and\n\n12\n00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:39.836\nhave them correct.\n\n13\n00:00:39.836 --> 00:00:43.660\nI guess not even profile manager we talked\na little how to keep things reeled in but\n\n14\n00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.722\nin Apple remote desktop, in this section,\nwhat we're going to do in this episode.\n\n15\n00:00:46.722 --> 00:00:50.860\nWe're gonna see a great way to take\nour existing clients and monitor them,\n\n16\n00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:52.770\nmake sure they're staying configured\nthe way that we want them.\n\n17\n00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.560\nThat they're staying up to\ndate as well as deploying and\n\n18\n00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.640\nreplacing software on those machines.\n\n19\n00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.500\nAnd all throughout we're gonna be\nusing a really cool utility called\n\n20\n00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.250\nApple Remote Desktop.\n\n21\n00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.830\nAnd it's a neat set of software\nthat's really easy to implement and\n\n22\n00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:07.290\ngives you a lot of power.\n\n23\n00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.820\nSo this is a true management episode here,\n\n24\n00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.029\nwe're gonna be managing\nsome Macs basically.\n\n25\n00:01:13.029 --> 00:01:14.094\n>> Basically?\n\n26\n00:01:14.094 --> 00:01:18.250\n[LAUGH] Alright so\nlet's get started with this thing.\n\n27\n00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.510\nIf you wanna implement\nApple Remote Desktop,\n\n28\n00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:23.500\nstep one very much like the server\nproduct is we've gotta buy it.\n\n29\n00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.390\nIt's part of the Apple app store, so\nyou can jump in the app store and find it.\n\n30\n00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.470\nSo for example,\nlet me just fire up my app store here and\n\n31\n00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:37.820\nif I go into my Apple app store, and\nwe won't buy Lego Avengers this time.\n\n32\n00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:43.550\nBut we are gonna look for Apple Remote\nDesktop and we're gonna find that.\n\n33\n00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:45.880\nAnd you'll find it right there\nApple Remote Desktop and\n\n34\n00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:46.830\nI've already bought it on my own.\n\n35\n00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:48.410\nSo it just got little open option,\n\n36\n00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:52.633\nbut if you haven't bought it I believe\nit's $80 dollars or $79.99 or something.\n\n37\n00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:57.240\nIt's not cheap for somebody who\njust wants to goof around with it.\n\n38\n00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.930\nBut it's extremely cheap for\na corporation or\n\n39\n00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.250\nenterprise that's trying to\nmanage Macs for what it does.\n\n40\n00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.730\nIt's very powerful and we'll get a chance\nto see some of the things that it does\n\n41\n00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:07.240\nright here in this episode.\n\n42\n00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.390\nright, so step one we gotta buy it and\nget it installed.\n\n43\n00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.640\nBut once you install it, it's actually\na really straightforward program.\n\n44\n00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:20.140\nSo here I am on a Mac that I've got set up\nand I've named this one OS X- Server 01.\n\n45\n00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.320\nAnd remember that a server all it is\na regular old mac that we've installed\n\n46\n00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.110\nthe server app on and so I've done that.\n\n47\n00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:27.630\nBut When I set up a server,\n\n48\n00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.080\none of the things I like to do is\nturn off all the flashy garbage.\n\n49\n00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.780\nSo I get rid of the mountain wallpaper,\n\n50\n00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.990\nI get rid of all the extra\nstuff in the dock.\n\n51\n00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.900\nAnd I get it set up for the real\nserver type utilities that I need.\n\n52\n00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.810\nSo that's what I've done\nhere on this server so\n\n53\n00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.070\nit's kind of set-up the way that I\nlike to set these up in the field.\n\n54\n00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:44.290\nAnd I got my server app here but\n\n55\n00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.840\nwe're doing Apple remote desktop we\ndon't actually need the server app.\n\n56\n00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.110\nWe need the Apple Remote Desktop app,\nwhich is what I've got right here.\n\n57\n00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.490\nAnd so when I fire up Remote Desktop,\n\n58\n00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:57.490\nI'm gonna see a panel that looks\nsomething like this, okay.\n\n59\n00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:02.090\nAnd the way the Apple Remote Desktop app\nworks is actually really straightforward.\n\n60\n00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:08.260\nWhat it does is kind of the first\nstage of it is, it scans your network.\n\n61\n00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.700\nIt's scanning your network,\nlooking for other Macs.\n\n62\n00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.820\nAnd so when I take a look at this one,\nI can see I've got a scanner and\n\n63\n00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:19.030\nit's scanning the network and\nit's found a Mac Mini.\n\n64\n00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.340\nIt found a Mac Mini for Studio 2 and\nhere's the IP address of it,\n\n65\n00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.450\nand it's apparently set up for\nApple Remote Desktop already.\n\n66\n00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:26.600\nSo here it is.\n\n67\n00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.950\nIt found this Mac.\n\n68\n00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.460\nIt's scanning your network looking for\nMacs that are out there and\n\n69\n00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:34.340\nit's not just using one protocol.\n\n70\n00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.410\nSo bonjour is kinda the default one,\n\n71\n00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:40.290\nthat's the Apple protocol they use to\nfind things on the network very easily.\n\n72\n00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:45.270\nBut if I drop that down it can scan\nthe local network by IP address.\n\n73\n00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:49.940\nWe can do ranges of IPs to search,\nwe can do a particular IP\n\n74\n00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:52.720\naddress a particular network\naddress if we wanna find one.\n\n75\n00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.780\nWe can do a file import if\nyou have a CSV built-up that\n\n76\n00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.170\nlists all the machines on the network.\n\n77\n00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:01.770\nYou can use a task server which\nthe second app will remote desktop server\n\n78\n00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:02.790\nsomewhere else.\n\n79\n00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.840\nOr you can use a directory server\nif you have active directory or\n\n80\n00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.470\nopen directory, they can have computer\naccounts in there and they can use those.\n\n81\n00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:12.599\nSo it can find machines on your\nnetwork a number of different ways\n\n82\n00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:15.520\nThat being said bonjour is the easiest.\n\n83\n00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:18.260\nBonjour just looks in the local\nnetwork and it finds them, and\n\n84\n00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.990\nif you've only got one\nsubnet that works great.\n\n85\n00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:23.800\nIf you've got more than one\nsubnet that's a bit of a problem.\n\n86\n00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.890\nAnd so the solution if you\nhave more than one subnet\n\n87\n00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:30.890\nis to either use file importer or\ndirector server.\n\n88\n00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:34.710\nOr to take advantage of\nApple Remote Desktop's Task Server,\n\n89\n00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:36.480\nnow what's a Task Server?\n\n90\n00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:39.270\nWell, Apple Remote Desktop\nis made up of two pieces.\n\n91\n00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:41.510\nThere's the user interface that\nwe're looking at right now, so\n\n92\n00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:43.990\nthis is the user interface for ARD.\n\n93\n00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:47.530\nAnd then there's the Task Server,\nthat's what runs in the background and\n\n94\n00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:48.930\ndoes all the work.\n\n95\n00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:52.680\nWhen you install ARD, you're\ninstalling both the user interface and\n\n96\n00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:53.320\nthe Task Server.\n\n97\n00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:57.920\nIf I work for\na company that has a headquarters and\n\n98\n00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:02.450\n50 branch offices, at my headquarters\nI might install ARD on a system.\n\n99\n00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:06.590\nJust like I've got right here, right\nboth the front end and the task server.\n\n100\n00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:09.940\nBut at all of my branches\nI might do the same thing.\n\n101\n00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:15.160\nI might deploy a Mac Mini at every branch,\nthis running ARD and the task server.\n\n102\n00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.160\nThey're installed at the same time, it's\nnot like you have to do anything special,\n\n103\n00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:19.610\nyou just click next and it's done.\n\n104\n00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:24.810\nSo they've got it out there, but\nI can take the user interface here and\n\n105\n00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:27.480\nconnect to the task\nserver in other places.\n\n106\n00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:28.410\nAnd when I do that,\n\n107\n00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:32.390\nwhen I'm connected to somebody else's\ntask server I see their network.\n\n108\n00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:35.100\nI see the Macs on their network,\nso we drop that down and\n\n109\n00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:37.360\nchoose task server, right?\n\n110\n00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:41.240\nIt's gonna identify other task\nservers I've got on the network, and\n\n111\n00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:44.365\nthen let me see what they're finding okay?\n\n112\n00:05:44.365 --> 00:05:48.245\nAnd so I don't have any right now, so\nI can manually add some in if I had them.\n\n113\n00:05:48.245 --> 00:05:51.835\nBut otherwise I'm only gonna see what's\nlocal on my network which is what that\n\n114\n00:05:51.835 --> 00:05:52.985\nBonjour is doing.\n\n115\n00:05:52.985 --> 00:05:56.345\nSo we've got a few different ways we can\nget out there to find those systems.\n\n116\n00:05:56.345 --> 00:05:59.835\nNow, to find a system we do have to be\non the same network as them, and so\n\n117\n00:05:59.835 --> 00:06:01.125\nif I look at this machine.\n\n118\n00:06:02.195 --> 00:06:04.763\nSo this machine is on what network?\n\n119\n00:06:04.763 --> 00:06:06.680\nLet's just find out.\n\n120\n00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:09.620\nSo this one is on the 192.168.0 network,\nright?\n\n121\n00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:12.480\nSo there it is, 192.168.0.\n\n122\n00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:18.870\nI want to manage, I wanna control a client\nthat's on a different network, okay?\n\n123\n00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:22.150\nSo, I've got this client right here,\nit's running Yosemite.\n\n124\n00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:26.120\nIt's up and it's happy, Not Yosemite,\nEl Capitán, or whatever this is, right.\n\n125\n00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:30.560\nSo it's running Mac OS is the important\npart, and I wanna get it managed.\n\n126\n00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:34.280\nWell if I wanna take\na look at its terminal and\n\n127\n00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:40.234\nI do a quick ifconfig and\nlook at its internet address.\n\n128\n00:06:40.234 --> 00:06:45.472\nIt's 192.160.0.150, my server is 0.151\n\n129\n00:06:45.472 --> 00:06:51.560\nthe client is 150,\nthey're on the same network, right?\n\n130\n00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:53.700\nWhy didn't this guy show up?\n\n131\n00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:58.690\nWell Apple Remote Desktop,\nit has two server pieces and\n\n132\n00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:00.660\nit's got a client piece also.\n\n133\n00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:04.060\nSo on the server side we have the GY and\nthe task server, and\n\n134\n00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:07.880\non the client side you've\ngot remote management.\n\n135\n00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:12.860\nAnd you've got to enable remote management\nif you want to remotely manage it.\n\n136\n00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:14.390\nI guess that's why they call it that,\nright?\n\n137\n00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:17.580\nSo if remote management is not turned\non on the Mac, we're not gonna see it.\n\n138\n00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:20.700\nSo when I fire up ARD,\nor if you fire it up for\n\n139\n00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:24.940\nthe first time, don't be\nsurprised if you get nothing back.\n\n140\n00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:28.890\nYou get no systems back and that's it,\nthere's just nobody else out there, right?\n\n141\n00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:31.140\nDon't be surprised if that happens,\n\n142\n00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:33.440\nyou've gotta go to your clients and\nget it turned on.\n\n143\n00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:36.470\nAnd so what I normally do is that\nwe build a net install image\n\n144\n00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:37.760\nto deploy on our network.\n\n145\n00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:40.640\nI'll normally turn on management\nin the net install image.\n\n146\n00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:43.680\nSo that when I roll that out to all of my\nclients, they've already got it turned on.\n\n147\n00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:46.760\nBut if you wanna do it after the fact it's\npretty easy and let me show you here.\n\n148\n00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:50.569\nI'm gonna go to this client and\nlet me just get out of the Terminal.\n\n149\n00:07:50.569 --> 00:07:54.205\nAnd I'm gonna go into my\nSystem Preferences, so when I jump\n\n150\n00:07:54.205 --> 00:07:58.806\ninto System Preferences the preference\nthat I'm looking for is Sharing.\n\n151\n00:07:58.806 --> 00:08:01.509\nI know it seems kinda weird sharing\nis where I wanna go for this,\n\n152\n00:08:01.509 --> 00:08:04.212\nbut it's a network function so\nI'm gonna go into Sharing, and\n\n153\n00:08:04.212 --> 00:08:06.060\nthen inside of Sharing I\ncan give it a name.\n\n154\n00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:07.510\nAnd right now it's just called Don's Mac,\nbut\n\n155\n00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:11.450\nI'm gonna rename it, I'm gonna call this\nOSX-CLIENT01, that's what I wanna call it.\n\n156\n00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:18.350\nAnd then in the Services list over here,\nI'm gonna find Remote Management.\n\n157\n00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:21.940\nAnd see our Remote Management is\nturned off, I need to turn it on.\n\n158\n00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:26.600\nI need to enable this so that people can\nremotely connect and manage the system.\n\n159\n00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:29.790\nNow here's the thing,\nwhen you turn on Remote Management,\n\n160\n00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:31.440\nit's a little bit of a security concern,\nisn't it?\n\n161\n00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:34.190\nWhen we turn on our Remote Management,\n\n162\n00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:37.650\nthere's a number of different things\nwe're allowing somebody to do.\n\n163\n00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:43.760\nSo when I turn that on It's gonna ask me,\nwhat do I wanna allow people to do?\n\n164\n00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:48.680\nAnd, it's saying, all local users.\n\n165\n00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:51.890\nAnybody who has a user\naccount on this computer\n\n166\n00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:56.760\nwill be able to remotely connect and\ndo any of these things.\n\n167\n00:08:56.760 --> 00:09:01.820\nWell, I don't want that, I'm just gonna\nleave it empty like this and say okay.\n\n168\n00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:06.140\nNow when I do that, technically\nI've enabled Remote Management but\n\n169\n00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:10.350\nI haven't turned on any functionality so\nit's not gonna be happy about that, right?\n\n170\n00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:15.230\nSo what we normally do is we normally\ncreate some kind of local user account for\n\n171\n00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:19.310\nRemote Management like a help desk\naccount is what I see a lot and so\n\n172\n00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:22.970\nI'm gonna back up out of this and\nI'm gonna go into Users and Groups, and\n\n173\n00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:27.380\nI'm gonna add a new user account, and\nthis user account is gonna be used for\n\n174\n00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:30.870\nremote management for the company.\n\n175\n00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:34.750\nSo once I've got that enabled,\nI can add a new user account and\n\n176\n00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:39.210\nI'll just call it Remote Management,\nor I might wanna call it ARD,\n\n177\n00:09:39.210 --> 00:09:42.930\nlike this is just going to be\ndedicated for Apple Remote Desktop.\n\n178\n00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:46.140\nSo we can set that up.\n\n179\n00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:50.620\nName is already taken by the application\nitself, so I'll just call it ARD so\n\n180\n00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:54.820\nthat the account name itself is\njust straight up ard like that, and\n\n181\n00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:56.820\nthen I'm just gonna not do iCloud for\n\n182\n00:09:56.820 --> 00:10:00.580\nthis one, we'll just do a regular one and\nI'll set a nice secure password.\n\n183\n00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:03.260\nWe don't want our users to know\nthis cuz I'm gonna make the account\n\n184\n00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:04.340\nan administrator.\n\n185\n00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:08.240\nRight, if you look up here,\nI've got administrator, I want it to be\n\n186\n00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:12.720\nan administrator so it can do all the\nvarious things in this system, all right.\n\n187\n00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:15.380\nSo now I've got that account created,\nit shows up right there.\n\n188\n00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:17.860\nThere's that ARD and, aw, it's a flower.\n\n189\n00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:19.110\nMaybe we wanna change that.\n\n190\n00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:21.410\nSo [LAUGH] here we'll make it an owl.\n\n191\n00:10:21.410 --> 00:10:24.980\nARD is always watching you,\nso we've got an owl.\n\n192\n00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:28.360\nSo now I've got that in place,\nI've got a user account that ARD can use.\n\n193\n00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:34.320\nSo if I go back to my sharing screen\ninside of that Remote Management option\n\n194\n00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:39.030\ninstead of turning it on for\neverybody, I can say only these users.\n\n195\n00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:45.530\nI only want certain users to use ARD,\nand I'm gonna add the ARD account.\n\n196\n00:10:45.530 --> 00:10:47.040\nRight I'm gonna select that.\n\n197\n00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:49.380\nSo the ARD users gonna be\nable to remotely connect, and\n\n198\n00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:53.010\nnow instead of saying all local users,\nit just says ARD\n\n199\n00:10:53.010 --> 00:10:56.980\ncan access this computer to do, and\nI'm just gonna enable everything.\n\n200\n00:10:56.980 --> 00:10:58.070\nI want them to be able to do everything.\n\n201\n00:10:58.070 --> 00:11:02.560\nSo let's talk about what these things are,\nall right?\n\n202\n00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:07.210\nWhen I have Apple Remote Desktop,\nI can remotely connect to 1 machine,\n\n203\n00:11:07.210 --> 00:11:12.170\n10 machines, 100 machines, 1,000 machines,\ntens of thousands of machines, and\n\n204\n00:11:12.170 --> 00:11:17.210\nperform actions all at once, and this list\nright here, these are some of the actions.\n\n205\n00:11:17.210 --> 00:11:19.190\nThe first one, Observe.\n\n206\n00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:21.970\nObserve is really handy for help desk.\n\n207\n00:11:21.970 --> 00:11:24.980\nYou're on the phone with somebody and\nthey, yeah, I'm trying to do this and\n\n208\n00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:26.330\nit just won't work.\n\n209\n00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:28.630\nAnd you say, well,\ncan you tell me what you're doing?\n\n210\n00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:30.739\nAnd they say,\nI'm clicking on this button right here.\n\n211\n00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:33.130\nI can't see their computer,\n\n212\n00:11:33.130 --> 00:11:36.840\nI don't know what they're talking about,\nObserve lets me see their screen.\n\n213\n00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:39.880\nI can see their screen and\nthey can show me exactly what's going on.\n\n214\n00:11:40.930 --> 00:11:45.350\nEven better, if we turn on the control\noption I can control their screen and\n\n215\n00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:48.770\nI can say, can you just give me a minute\nand I can pull up their screen and\n\n216\n00:11:48.770 --> 00:11:50.750\ntake over, I can use the mouse.\n\n217\n00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:54.050\nSo now instead of me saying, okay,\nwell, can you click on the Apple and\n\n218\n00:11:54.050 --> 00:11:55.360\ngo to System Preferences?\n\n219\n00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:57.130\nCan you go here and change this?\n\n220\n00:11:57.130 --> 00:11:58.120\nI can just do it for them.\n\n221\n00:11:58.120 --> 00:11:58.880\nIt's faster.\n\n222\n00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:01.810\nIt's like those old Nick Burns\nSaturday Night Live sketch, move,\n\n223\n00:12:01.810 --> 00:12:04.900\nget out of the way let me do it,\nthat's how this is.\n\n224\n00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:06.830\nWe can connect and do it.\n\n225\n00:12:06.830 --> 00:12:08.149\nShow when being observed.\n\n226\n00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:13.460\nIf we turn this off, they won't even\nknow that we're watching, and so\n\n227\n00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:15.610\nyou can spy on the user.\n\n228\n00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:18.730\nAnd now I kinda put in quotes,\nthis is really handy for teachers.\n\n229\n00:12:18.730 --> 00:12:21.530\nIf you got a teacher that's running a lab\nand they've got students in all of these\n\n230\n00:12:21.530 --> 00:12:24.680\ncomputers, a teacher can be connecting\nto each of the student machines to\n\n231\n00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:26.830\nmake sure they're working, that they're\non task, to see what they're doing.\n\n232\n00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:28.240\nSo, you've got that option.\n\n233\n00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:31.700\nThen we've got Generate Reports.\n\n234\n00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:34.480\nWe can pull reports on these\nmachines to see what version of\n\n235\n00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:36.900\nsoftware they're running,\nwhat type of hardware they've got,\n\n236\n00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:40.270\nthis is a great way to do asset inventory\nof all the Macs on your network.\n\n237\n00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:43.590\nOpen and quit applications.\n\n238\n00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:46.720\nWe can actually launch and close\napplications running on these systems\n\n239\n00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:49.450\nremotely, so if you wanna start\nsomething up, you can do that.\n\n240\n00:12:49.450 --> 00:12:50.980\nWe can change settings, right?\n\n241\n00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:54.660\nWe can actually modify the system\npreferences of a computer without\n\n242\n00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:57.140\nactually logging in to the computer.\n\n243\n00:12:57.140 --> 00:12:58.750\nDelete and replace items.\n\n244\n00:12:58.750 --> 00:13:01.440\nThat's part of what we use for\nrolling out software and applications.\n\n245\n00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:06.260\nYou can push programs out and upgrade\napplications by deleting and replacing.\n\n246\n00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:08.410\nWe can start a text chat and\nsend messages.\n\n247\n00:13:08.410 --> 00:13:10.480\nSo, maybe you don't wanna be\non the phone with a person,\n\n248\n00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:13.780\nyou just want to send an onscreen\nmessage to them, you've got that option.\n\n249\n00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:14.980\nRestart and shut down.\n\n250\n00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:17.640\nI can reboot the computer,\nI can turn it off.\n\n251\n00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:19.190\nAnd then, copy items.\n\n252\n00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:23.420\nYou can send files to it or\nretrieve files from the client.\n\n253\n00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:25.870\nThat's another great way that\nwe can upgrade applications.\n\n254\n00:13:25.870 --> 00:13:28.410\nThese are all cool features of ARD.\n\n255\n00:13:28.410 --> 00:13:32.190\n>> Don, I got a little security concept\nkinda like the whole angel devil on one\n\n256\n00:13:32.190 --> 00:13:35.670\nside here I got little security concept\nthat keeps whispering in my ear and\n\n257\n00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:39.000\nthe way you’re setting up ARD\nreally looks like a concept\n\n258\n00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:40.970\nthat we know as principle\nof least privilege.\n\n259\n00:13:40.970 --> 00:13:44.520\nYou didn’t want every local user to be\nable to log in to this machine, You set up\n\n260\n00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:48.290\na privileged account that is only gonna\nbe used for that specific purpose.\n\n261\n00:13:48.290 --> 00:13:49.610\nIs that what's going on here?\n\n262\n00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:53.590\n>> Yeah, that's basically it cuz if\nI leave it to any local account,\n\n263\n00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:57.430\nthen technically that person who\nhas the login on the machine,\n\n264\n00:13:57.430 --> 00:14:02.320\nthey could bring their own Macbook from\nhome and fire up ARD that they bought\n\n265\n00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:04.497\nfrom the app store and\nthey could remotely connect in and\n\n266\n00:14:04.497 --> 00:14:07.230\nRemote Manage their own system and\nI might not want that.\n\n267\n00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:09.760\nSo we're just trying to keep\nit as limited as possible and\n\n268\n00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:11.930\nthat's why I created\na dedicated ARD account.\n\n269\n00:14:11.930 --> 00:14:15.010\nYou don't have to do that, we could\njust use the local user accounts, but\n\n270\n00:14:15.010 --> 00:14:18.240\nhaving a dedicated account is kind of\na better way to go about it in my opinion.\n\n271\n00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:20.270\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n272\n00:14:20.270 --> 00:14:24.990\nsay OK to that and now,\nthis client says remote management on.\n\n273\n00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:27.320\nIt is on, it's ready to go and\n\n274\n00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:30.858\nthis ARD account is allowed to connect and\nwork with the system.\n\n275\n00:14:30.858 --> 00:14:31.432\nAll right,\n\n276\n00:14:31.432 --> 00:14:36.040\nso I'm gonna stop messing with the client\nand I'm gonna jump back over to my server.\n\n277\n00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:38.590\nOn my server Look what the scanner did.\n\n278\n00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:43.020\nThe scanner already found OSX-CLIENT01,\nit already found it.\n\n279\n00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:49.484\nIt sees it on the network and it's\nrunning ARD version 3.8.5, it's got it.\n\n280\n00:14:49.484 --> 00:14:51.170\nNow, I can remotely manage the system.\n\n281\n00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:56.200\nRemember how I mentioned that we\ncan remotely manage the system and\n\n282\n00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:59.740\nwe can really manage, hundreds or\neven thousands of systems.\n\n283\n00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:04.580\nWell, the way we do that is by\norganizing our computers in the groups.\n\n284\n00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:08.660\nYou've actually, what's called a list\nright here, the All Computers list.\n\n285\n00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:11.920\nAnd when I go to All Computers,\nI see nothing.\n\n286\n00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:16.600\nMy scanner found the machines, but\nI'm not actually managing them yet, and\n\n287\n00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:20.080\nthe reason is, I haven't told it\na user account to use to manage it.\n\n288\n00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:23.210\nWe found it, but\nwe can't do anything to it yet.\n\n289\n00:15:23.210 --> 00:15:27.664\nI need to take that computer and\nput it in a list before I can manage it.\n\n290\n00:15:27.664 --> 00:15:31.190\nSo I'm gonna take this OSX-CLIENT01 and\ndrag it and\n\n291\n00:15:31.190 --> 00:15:33.670\ndrop it right into All Computers, and\n\n292\n00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:39.220\nwhen I do that it says what's a valid\nuser account for managing this system.\n\n293\n00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:44.069\nAnd I'm gonna punch in that ard account\nthat I made and the password that I\n\n294\n00:15:44.069 --> 00:15:49.492\nassigned to it, and once I've got that\nin place, now I'll be able to manage it.\n\n295\n00:15:49.492 --> 00:15:52.137\nAnd so I'm gonna add that one in,\nthere it goes, and\n\n296\n00:15:52.137 --> 00:15:54.614\nsee how it's got a little\nblue dot beside it now?\n\n297\n00:15:54.614 --> 00:15:56.180\nThat lets me know it's managed.\n\n298\n00:15:56.180 --> 00:16:00.240\nRight, versus Mac Mini Studio\n2 doesn't have a blue dot.\n\n299\n00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:01.800\nIt's not managed.\n\n300\n00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:05.633\nAnd if I go to my All Computers,\nthere's OSX-CLIENT01.\n\n301\n00:16:05.633 --> 00:16:09.505\nIt's available,\nthe IP address is 192.168.0.150.\n\n302\n00:16:09.505 --> 00:16:11.654\nThe current application is Finder and\n\n303\n00:16:11.654 --> 00:16:15.070\nthe current person logged\ninto it is Don Pezet, right?\n\n304\n00:16:15.070 --> 00:16:18.690\nWatch this, if I go back over to that\nclient, and I fire up a different program,\n\n305\n00:16:18.690 --> 00:16:22.490\nmaybe I fire up Safari and so\nI'm browsing the Internet.\n\n306\n00:16:22.490 --> 00:16:26.760\nWhen I jump back over here, current\napplication Safari, it's communicating\n\n307\n00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:30.468\nwith that client, it sees it and\ndid I have to wait for that to happen?\n\n308\n00:16:30.468 --> 00:16:32.047\nIt was near instantaneous.\n\n309\n00:16:32.047 --> 00:16:36.210\nThe client knows, hey, when I launch\na new application, report that to ARD.\n\n310\n00:16:36.210 --> 00:16:40.492\nIt's talking to the server, they're\ncommunicating and exchanging that data,\n\n311\n00:16:40.492 --> 00:16:43.283\nand so, I can see who's\nlogged in in the machine, and\n\n312\n00:16:43.283 --> 00:16:45.781\nwhat application they're\nrunning right now.\n\n313\n00:16:45.781 --> 00:16:49.013\nAnd if they have more than\none application, right, so\n\n314\n00:16:49.013 --> 00:16:52.370\nmaybe they fire up photos,\nmessages, right?\n\n315\n00:16:52.370 --> 00:16:55.560\nMessages, or iMessages,\nthe one I've got in the foreground, and so\n\n316\n00:16:55.560 --> 00:17:00.360\nwhen I go back over here, it's showing me\nthe one that I'm actually using right now.\n\n317\n00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:03.090\nI've got other ones in the background,\nthis is the one I'm using right now,\n\n318\n00:17:03.090 --> 00:17:04.510\nmessages, right?\n\n319\n00:17:04.510 --> 00:17:07.020\nSo now you get an idea of whether\nthe computer's actually in use.\n\n320\n00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:08.020\n>> And that's fairly quick, too.\n\n321\n00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:09.870\nI mean, that's almost in real time, so\n\n322\n00:17:09.870 --> 00:17:15.300\nI can see where a teacher, sleight of hand\nby the kids, yeah, I'm doing my work.\n\n323\n00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:18.330\nI've got my calculator open, but\nyou're not looking at your calculator,\n\n324\n00:17:18.330 --> 00:17:19.780\nyou're looking at Safari.\n\n325\n00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:22.520\n>> Yeah, you spot that really easy,\nit's right there.\n\n326\n00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:26.660\nSo the other thing though is, I've got\none list called all computers, and\n\n327\n00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:30.680\nif I want to perform an activity against\nall of my computers, that works out great.\n\n328\n00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:34.780\nBut I probably want to divide my\nnetwork up into smaller lists, and\n\n329\n00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:39.770\nso I can go up to my File menu up here and\ngo to File > New List.\n\n330\n00:17:39.770 --> 00:17:44.234\nAnd we just start making other lists,\nand so I might have,\n\n331\n00:17:44.234 --> 00:17:47.340\nlike teachers, I might have students.\n\n332\n00:17:47.340 --> 00:17:50.090\nI'm just hitting Cmd+N to make more lists.\n\n333\n00:17:50.090 --> 00:17:54.150\nI might have servers, oops, server.\n\n334\n00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:58.980\nI might have servers, you can rename any\nof these however you want, so we just go\n\n335\n00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:02.940\nin and we start naming them, so servers\nand so on, I name each one of them.\n\n336\n00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:06.300\nAnd now, I can drag and\ndrop the computers into the list and\n\n337\n00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:10.010\na computer can be in more than one list.\n\n338\n00:18:10.010 --> 00:18:13.410\nAnd that's because I might\nhave lists that are based on\n\n339\n00:18:13.410 --> 00:18:15.140\nthe type of person that uses it.\n\n340\n00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:17.730\nI might have lists that are based\non the hardware, right,\n\n341\n00:18:17.730 --> 00:18:24.570\nI could have a list that was maybe\na laptops versus desktops, right?\n\n342\n00:18:24.570 --> 00:18:27.720\nSo I might have certain things that\nI want to perform against my laptops,\n\n343\n00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:31.320\nI want to set up a power management\nprofile on all my laptops.\n\n344\n00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:34.860\nThat might be different than a desktop so,\nI start to organize.\n\n345\n00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:38.020\nSo, now I can go to all computers and I\ncan take that client and I can say, well,\n\n346\n00:18:38.020 --> 00:18:40.880\nthat's a student and so\nI'll throw it over there and\n\n347\n00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:43.130\nI'll take it and throw it on to desktops.\n\n348\n00:18:43.130 --> 00:18:46.780\nSo, now when I go to Students, there's\nthat client, and when I go to Desktops,\n\n349\n00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:50.700\nthere's that client, when I go to\nLaptops they're not there, right?\n\n350\n00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:54.970\nThis is what's going to enable me to pick\nand choose who I deploy applications to,\n\n351\n00:18:54.970 --> 00:18:58.230\nwho I run reports on,\nwho I'm monitoring and so on.\n\n352\n00:18:58.230 --> 00:19:01.474\nIt gives us organization,\nand those are called lists,\n\n353\n00:19:01.474 --> 00:19:04.178\nright they're just groupings of computers.\n\n354\n00:19:04.178 --> 00:19:08.696\nOnce I've got that, now the real\nfun starts, I've got them managed,\n\n355\n00:19:08.696 --> 00:19:10.480\nwhat do I do with it?\n\n356\n00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:12.798\nWell, it's actually already\ndoing stuff in the background,\n\n357\n00:19:12.798 --> 00:19:14.910\neven without me messing with it.\n\n358\n00:19:14.910 --> 00:19:18.340\nI mean we already saw the application,\nit's harvesting that, but\n\n359\n00:19:18.340 --> 00:19:20.130\nnow I can really start to make use of it.\n\n360\n00:19:20.130 --> 00:19:24.590\nIf I take that client and click on it,\nyou'll see I've got a few options up here,\n\n361\n00:19:24.590 --> 00:19:27.040\nright, these little buttons, like Observe.\n\n362\n00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:30.387\nObserve, I wanna watch that machine, so\nI'm an admin, I get a phone call from\n\n363\n00:19:30.387 --> 00:19:33.448\nsomebody, they're having a problem,\nI want to observe the machine.\n\n364\n00:19:33.448 --> 00:19:37.930\nI find them in ARD,\nI click on them, and I hit Observe.\n\n365\n00:19:37.930 --> 00:19:42.390\nAnd now I see their desktop, here's\nthat client, they're in iMessage, okay?\n\n366\n00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:47.530\nAnd if I try and do anything,\nwell I can't right?\n\n367\n00:19:47.530 --> 00:19:48.510\nI'm clicking and\n\n368\n00:19:48.510 --> 00:19:53.400\nnothing is happening because I'm just\nobserving, I'm just watching, right?\n\n369\n00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:56.230\nAnd over here,\nhere's the person who's being observed,\n\n370\n00:19:56.230 --> 00:20:00.270\nand I don't know that I'm being observed,\ndo I?\n\n371\n00:20:00.270 --> 00:20:05.210\nI can't really see that, I just see\nthat I'm working like normal because we\n\n372\n00:20:05.210 --> 00:20:07.830\nturned on that option that said we didn't\nhave to show that we were being observed.\n\n373\n00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:12.850\nAnd it's just watching at this point, but\nwe also enabled the ability to control,\n\n374\n00:20:12.850 --> 00:20:16.500\nand so looking up top you'll see\nwhere I've got other options up here\n\n375\n00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:18.150\nwhere we can switch to control.\n\n376\n00:20:18.150 --> 00:20:22.280\nIf I get out of this, actually I think,\nI got the shortcut button right here,\n\n377\n00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:25.640\nsee how it says Switch between Control and\nObserve Mode?\n\n378\n00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:28.280\nAnd if I switch into Control Mode,\n\n379\n00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:33.170\nnow I'm actually working on their system,\nand I can take over, and\n\n380\n00:20:33.170 --> 00:20:35.700\nI can say, well here, let me just go in\nand I'm gonna change the setting for you.\n\n381\n00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:40.370\nI'm gonna go into System Preferences, and\nI'm gonna go in and change your desktop or\n\n382\n00:20:40.370 --> 00:20:43.460\nyour wallpaper or whatever, so we go\nin there and we start messing with it.\n\n383\n00:20:43.460 --> 00:20:46.980\nAnd the client is seeing all that in real\ntime, and they still have control, too, so\n\n384\n00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:49.790\nthey can say, woah,\nI don't want that wallpaper, it stinks.\n\n385\n00:20:49.790 --> 00:20:53.350\nThen they can kinda back out, but\nas the admin, we've got that access and\n\n386\n00:20:53.350 --> 00:20:54.910\nwe're now controlling it.\n\n387\n00:20:54.910 --> 00:20:57.280\nSo really cool that we can\nkinda manage that and see it.\n\n388\n00:20:57.280 --> 00:21:00.920\nAnd if you're on a low bandwidth link,\nyou'll see when you're observing,\n\n389\n00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:04.770\nthere's a few neat little options that\nwe've got up here, up towards the top,\n\n390\n00:21:04.770 --> 00:21:06.760\nwhere you can adjust the image quality.\n\n391\n00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:11.430\nSo if it's like a really poor network\nconnection, you can drop this way down and\n\n392\n00:21:11.430 --> 00:21:12.810\nit'll go black and white like this.\n\n393\n00:21:12.810 --> 00:21:16.530\nI know it looks terrible but it's actually\nenough to be able to support and help\n\n394\n00:21:16.530 --> 00:21:22.880\nsomebody, it gives us enough visibility\nwith very, very little bandwidth required.\n\n395\n00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:25.970\nAnd so you can do things like loading\nimages like the ITProTV website,\n\n396\n00:21:25.970 --> 00:21:29.380\nwhere it's got that video that plays.\n\n397\n00:21:29.380 --> 00:21:31.770\nAnd normally when a video launches,\n\n398\n00:21:31.770 --> 00:21:36.270\nit really bogs down our remote connection,\ncuz it's having to load all that.\n\n399\n00:21:36.270 --> 00:21:39.850\nWell here, because it's gone black and\nwhite, because it's gone low quality,\n\n400\n00:21:39.850 --> 00:21:42.780\nit can load and it actually runs\npretty smooth because of that,\n\n401\n00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:47.150\nso neat that we can flip between those and\nadjust based on our needs.\n\n402\n00:21:47.150 --> 00:21:49.117\nIf you got a great network\nthat's high bandwidth,\n\n403\n00:21:49.117 --> 00:21:52.058\nyou can pump it all the way up and get\nreally high quality on that connection.\n\n404\n00:21:52.058 --> 00:21:53.985\nYou can also do what's called curtaining.\n\n405\n00:21:53.985 --> 00:22:01.510\nSo I've got this curtain option here and\nif I hit the curtain option,\n\n406\n00:22:01.510 --> 00:22:07.243\nwe can say system maintenance please wait,\nright.\n\n407\n00:22:07.243 --> 00:22:11.440\nI'm just going to type my message\nin there and we will set that.\n\n408\n00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:14.660\nAnd on my side, I'm now just\nworking on their system, right, so\n\n409\n00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:17.500\nI'm working on this person's computer and\nmaybe I want to go to some website\n\n410\n00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:22.070\nthat's just for admins and\nI don't want them to see that, you know.\n\n411\n00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:25.780\nMaybe I don't know what the problem is and\nso I'm like I need to Google this one,\n\n412\n00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:27.510\nbut I don't want them to\nknow I'm Googling right,\n\n413\n00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:30.920\nI want to look smart, so\nI curtain the system.\n\n414\n00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:35.370\nWell, on my side I still see\ntheir computer, they see this,\n\n415\n00:22:35.370 --> 00:22:39.840\nSystem Maintenance Please Wait, screen\nlocked by Don Pezet, the system is locked.\n\n416\n00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:43.260\nThey just see this curtain and\nthey don't know what's going on.\n\n417\n00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:46.440\nSo, if I know I'm going to be typing in\nsome administrative passwords or doing\n\n418\n00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:50.350\nsome shell commands that I don't want\nthem to see, we can lock it like that.\n\n419\n00:22:50.350 --> 00:22:53.190\nAnd when we turn the curtain off,\nthere we go,\n\n420\n00:22:53.190 --> 00:22:55.580\nnow they see their desktop again, right?\n\n421\n00:22:55.580 --> 00:22:59.420\nAnd they're right back in there, and able\nto work and see it, so, really need stuff\n\n422\n00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:03.640\nthere with a remote control, for\na help desk, this is extremely valuable.\n\n423\n00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:08.230\nDefinitely useful to be able to connect to\nthat client, and just see what's going on.\n\n424\n00:23:08.230 --> 00:23:11.978\nIt's a lot easier than having\nthe end user describe it to us.\n\n425\n00:23:11.978 --> 00:23:16.416\nAll right, some of the other things that\nyou can do, so I was doing Control and\n\n426\n00:23:16.416 --> 00:23:17.520\nObserve, right?\n\n427\n00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:19.315\nThose were the two that we just saw.\n\n428\n00:23:19.315 --> 00:23:26.562\nThere's also Send Message, I can send\na message and say, please stop doing that.\n\n429\n00:23:26.562 --> 00:23:30.609\n[LAUGH] If I see them doing something\nthey're not supposed to do, and\n\n430\n00:23:30.609 --> 00:23:35.162\nI can pick one or more clients, I can send\nit to more than one person if I want.\n\n431\n00:23:35.162 --> 00:23:38.719\nI can schedule the message to appear\nif I've got a maintenance window, but\n\n432\n00:23:38.719 --> 00:23:42.049\nI'm gonna go ahead and send it right now,\nand I can send that message,\n\n433\n00:23:42.049 --> 00:23:45.800\nand when I go look at the client, there\nit is, please stop doing that, right?\n\n434\n00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:50.605\nThey get that message that pops up,\nand maybe I'll telling them hey,\n\n435\n00:23:50.605 --> 00:23:53.627\nthe Lab is closing in 30 minutes, right?\n\n436\n00:23:53.627 --> 00:23:55.587\nAnd I schedule it to\noccur at that right time.\n\n437\n00:23:55.587 --> 00:23:58.600\nAnd now they all get a notice, they know I\nneed to start wrapping up what I'm doing.\n\n438\n00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:01.910\nAnd then hey, lab is gonna close in\nfive minutes, save your documents.\n\n439\n00:24:01.910 --> 00:24:03.890\nAnd now they know, hey, I gotta save it.\n\n440\n00:24:03.890 --> 00:24:06.200\nAnd then heck, I can send out\nthe Shut Down command, right?\n\n441\n00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:07.390\nWe've got that.\n\n442\n00:24:07.390 --> 00:24:13.930\nWhen we're in ARD, you can take a client,\none of these guys.\n\n443\n00:24:13.930 --> 00:24:17.210\nAnd we can send them a Shut Down\ncommand and turn them off.\n\n444\n00:24:17.210 --> 00:24:20.835\nNow I don't have a little button\nup here for Shut Down, right?\n\n445\n00:24:20.835 --> 00:24:23.490\nAnd when I right-click,\nI don't see Shut Down as an option.\n\n446\n00:24:23.490 --> 00:24:25.810\nSome options aren't used a lot.\n\n447\n00:24:25.810 --> 00:24:28.490\nAnd so Apple moves them up\ninto our upper menus here.\n\n448\n00:24:28.490 --> 00:24:32.650\nIf I pull down the Manage menu and look at\nsome of the things that we've got up here,\n\n449\n00:24:32.650 --> 00:24:38.050\nyou'll see Sleep, Wake, Restart,\nShut Down, Power On, Log Out Current User.\n\n450\n00:24:38.050 --> 00:24:39.640\nSo I can log somebody out.\n\n451\n00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:40.730\nI can kick them out.\n\n452\n00:24:40.730 --> 00:24:41.890\nI can shut the machine down.\n\n453\n00:24:41.890 --> 00:24:44.540\nI've got that control right here.\n\n454\n00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:48.540\nAll right, so, controlling a lab,\nreally, really good way to do that.\n\n455\n00:24:48.540 --> 00:24:50.430\nLet's see,\nsome of the other things that we can do.\n\n456\n00:24:50.430 --> 00:24:51.544\nLet me check.\n\n457\n00:24:51.544 --> 00:24:53.160\nI wanna make sure I don't\nleave anything out here.\n\n458\n00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:56.669\nSo we saw remote management,\nwhich is lot of fun.\n\n459\n00:24:56.669 --> 00:25:00.012\nDeploying software,\nway back to the beginning of the series,\n\n460\n00:25:00.012 --> 00:25:02.975\nwhere we did NetInstall and\nNetRestore and those guys,\n\n461\n00:25:02.975 --> 00:25:07.240\nwe showed how to bake applications\ninto our images to roll them out.\n\n462\n00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:09.150\nBut, what if you didn't do that?\n\n463\n00:25:09.150 --> 00:25:13.600\nWhat if you've got 1000 Macs out there\nin your network and you're like boy,\n\n464\n00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:16.520\nI wish I would have installed\nVirtualBox in all those machines?\n\n465\n00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:19.280\nOr I wish I would have installed\nGoogle Chrome on all those?\n\n466\n00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:20.794\nI don't wanna go do a NetInstall image.\n\n467\n00:25:20.794 --> 00:25:23.720\nNothing will boot up from network and\nall that mess.\n\n468\n00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:24.810\nWell, you don't have to.\n\n469\n00:25:24.810 --> 00:25:27.669\nYou can deploy software\nright here from ARD.\n\n470\n00:25:27.669 --> 00:25:29.400\nAnd it's actually pretty easy.\n\n471\n00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:33.140\nThe first thing you gotta figure out is\nhow your application is packaged, right.\n\n472\n00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:34.640\nApplications come in two forms.\n\n473\n00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:38.510\nThey either come as pkg files or they\ncome as just the straight up application.\n\n474\n00:25:38.510 --> 00:25:39.739\nLet me show you here on my server.\n\n475\n00:25:40.740 --> 00:25:42.660\nBefore this show,\nI downloaded two programs.\n\n476\n00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:45.450\nI downloaded Google Chrome and VirtualBox.\n\n477\n00:25:45.450 --> 00:25:46.820\nThey're both dmg files, right?\n\n478\n00:25:46.820 --> 00:25:47.850\nThat's how they were shipped to me.\n\n479\n00:25:47.850 --> 00:25:49.560\nSo I'm just going to mount those dmgs.\n\n480\n00:25:50.690 --> 00:25:52.650\nAnd so we're going to get those connected.\n\n481\n00:25:52.650 --> 00:25:54.065\nBut they're different.\n\n482\n00:25:54.065 --> 00:25:57.530\nVirtualBox ships as a package,\nas a pkg file.\n\n483\n00:25:57.530 --> 00:26:00.730\nChrome is just the application\nstuck in a dmg.\n\n484\n00:26:00.730 --> 00:26:03.540\nWhen it's just the application,\nall you do is drag the app and\n\n485\n00:26:03.540 --> 00:26:06.270\ndrop it in your Applications folder and\nit's installed.\n\n486\n00:26:06.270 --> 00:26:09.427\nBut when it's a package,\nyou gotta double click and run it and\n\n487\n00:26:09.427 --> 00:26:10.711\ndo the install that way.\n\n488\n00:26:10.711 --> 00:26:12.610\nAnd you have to hit Next a few times,\nright?\n\n489\n00:26:12.610 --> 00:26:16.690\nSo packages are different\nthan raw applications.\n\n490\n00:26:16.690 --> 00:26:18.560\nWell, ARD can distribute both.\n\n491\n00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:20.370\nIt's got that functionality.\n\n492\n00:26:20.370 --> 00:26:22.300\nSo, let's say that I wanna\nroll these guys out.\n\n493\n00:26:22.300 --> 00:26:23.380\nWe'll start with VirtualBox.\n\n494\n00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:25.960\nSo I wanna install\nVirtualBox on client one.\n\n495\n00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:29.510\nIf I jump over to my client, let's just\nmake sure that I don't have it already.\n\n496\n00:26:29.510 --> 00:26:33.800\nSo, I'll just use my spotlight and,\nsure enough, I don't have it.\n\n497\n00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:35.650\nOr I can go into the Applications folder.\n\n498\n00:26:35.650 --> 00:26:38.050\nQuit being lazy, I guess, and look here.\n\n499\n00:26:38.050 --> 00:26:43.730\nSo looking in here, no VirtualBox in\nmy list and no Chrome in my list.\n\n500\n00:26:43.730 --> 00:26:46.000\nSo I don't have either application\ninstalled in this client.\n\n501\n00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:47.780\nI want to install them both.\n\n502\n00:26:47.780 --> 00:26:53.130\nSo back here in ARD,\nI can pick either an entire list or\n\n503\n00:26:53.130 --> 00:26:56.020\nindividual machines or all computers.\n\n504\n00:26:56.020 --> 00:26:58.200\nI can pick who I wanna roll this out to.\n\n505\n00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:00.930\nMaybe I wanna roll this\nout to all of my students.\n\n506\n00:27:00.930 --> 00:27:05.660\nAnd I can go up to Manage, and\nI can choose one of two things.\n\n507\n00:27:05.660 --> 00:27:09.230\nIf I have a package,\nI wanna do Install Packages.\n\n508\n00:27:09.230 --> 00:27:13.500\nBut if I just have the application,\nI wanna do Copy Items, okay.\n\n509\n00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:14.530\nLet's start with VirtualBox.\n\n510\n00:27:14.530 --> 00:27:15.200\nSo that's a package.\n\n511\n00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:17.240\nI'll choose to install the package.\n\n512\n00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:19.220\nAnd now I can add in one or more packages.\n\n513\n00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:22.776\nAnd so I'm gonna hit add, and\nI'm gonna find VirtualBox and\n\n514\n00:27:22.776 --> 00:27:25.460\nI'm gonna add that package in.\n\n515\n00:27:25.460 --> 00:27:26.750\nSo I'll go ahead and open that.\n\n516\n00:27:26.750 --> 00:27:29.040\nAnd now I've got the VirtualBox package.\n\n517\n00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:32.860\nNow, what if somebody already\nhas VirtualBox installed?\n\n518\n00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:34.390\nI need to tell it what to do.\n\n519\n00:27:34.390 --> 00:27:35.800\nAnd so I'm gonna tell it a few things.\n\n520\n00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:40.050\nFirst off, I'm gonna say, hey,\nVirtualBox requires a reboot.\n\n521\n00:27:40.050 --> 00:27:42.020\nSo let's attempt to do a restart.\n\n522\n00:27:42.020 --> 00:27:43.360\nBut let the people save the documents.\n\n523\n00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:45.440\nIf they're in the middle of something,\nlet them save, but\n\n524\n00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:48.240\nwe do want to attempt to do the restart.\n\n525\n00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:50.840\nI’m gonna run the task from this server.\n\n526\n00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:53.160\nRight, I don’t have another\ntask server on the network.\n\n527\n00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:57.358\nIf a problem occurs, stop the copy\non everybody or just keep going?\n\n528\n00:27:57.358 --> 00:27:59.700\nRight, if a problem occurs,\nit'll stop on this one,\n\n529\n00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:02.600\nbut I don’t want it to stop everywhere\nelse, so I’ll leave that be.\n\n530\n00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:05.980\nI can encrypt,\nI can allow untrusted certificates.\n\n531\n00:28:05.980 --> 00:28:10.320\nThe software I’m installing,\nif the software is digitally signed\n\n532\n00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:14.500\nvia a cert that's trusted by Apple,\nI don't need this option.\n\n533\n00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:17.250\nBut if it's third-party software, it might\nbe signed by somebody I don't trust.\n\n534\n00:28:17.250 --> 00:28:18.670\nAnd so\nI might need to allow an untrusted one.\n\n535\n00:28:18.670 --> 00:28:22.150\nBut I'm pretty sure VirtualBox is\nthat way, so I'm gonna choose that.\n\n536\n00:28:22.150 --> 00:28:24.200\nAnd now I can pick who I wanna install to.\n\n537\n00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:27.120\nI wanna install to OSX-CLIENT01.\n\n538\n00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:30.680\nAll right, I could schedule\nthe install to happen after hours.\n\n539\n00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:33.105\nOr we could just throw caution to\nthe wind and install it right now,\n\n540\n00:28:33.105 --> 00:28:34.461\nwhich is exactly what I'm gonna do.\n\n541\n00:28:34.461 --> 00:28:36.252\nI'm gonna install VirtualBox.\n\n542\n00:28:36.252 --> 00:28:41.570\nAll right, as soon as that happens,\nI see something appear in my Active Tasks.\n\n543\n00:28:41.570 --> 00:28:43.900\nUnder Active Tasks,\nI see Install Packages and there it is,\n\n544\n00:28:43.900 --> 00:28:46.770\nthe client, it's receiving the item.\n\n545\n00:28:46.770 --> 00:28:51.470\nAnd as soon as it's received, it's copying\nthat PKG, there it is, it's installing.\n\n546\n00:28:51.470 --> 00:28:54.790\nSo it's installing that\npackage 0% complete.\n\n547\n00:28:54.790 --> 00:28:58.940\nSo it's gonna churn through that,\nget it installed, and now it's succeeded.\n\n548\n00:28:58.940 --> 00:29:01.840\nIt's got VirtualBox, all right.\n\n549\n00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:04.650\nBut that was one thing, and\nI wanted to roll out Chrome also.\n\n550\n00:29:04.650 --> 00:29:07.890\nSo I'm gonna go back here\nto my student's list.\n\n551\n00:29:07.890 --> 00:29:09.660\nAnd I'll go to Manage, and\n\n552\n00:29:09.660 --> 00:29:12.930\nthis time I'm gonna choose Copy Items\ninstead of Install Packages.\n\n553\n00:29:12.930 --> 00:29:16.510\nSo I'm gonna go to Copy Items,\nbecause I don't have a package for Chrome,\n\n554\n00:29:16.510 --> 00:29:18.740\nI just have an application I wanna copy.\n\n555\n00:29:18.740 --> 00:29:21.110\nSo I'm gonna add that application.\n\n556\n00:29:21.110 --> 00:29:24.690\nAnd so I'll browse into the Chrome\nInstaller, I'll choose Google Chrome.\n\n557\n00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:27.160\nWe'll open that up.\n\n558\n00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:29.410\nNow unlike a package,\n\n559\n00:29:29.410 --> 00:29:33.140\na package knows where to copy itself,\nan application doesn't.\n\n560\n00:29:33.140 --> 00:29:34.960\nI have to tell it where to put it.\n\n561\n00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:39.350\nSo it says Place items in, and\nI need to tell it where to go.\n\n562\n00:29:39.350 --> 00:29:40.240\nThe default's the desktop.\n\n563\n00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:41.540\nThat's absolutely not where I want it.\n\n564\n00:29:42.540 --> 00:29:46.640\nIf I drop that down,\nI can pick from well-known folders, or\n\n565\n00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:48.500\nI can specify a path.\n\n566\n00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:51.590\nI wanna copy it to\nthe Applications Folder.\n\n567\n00:29:51.590 --> 00:29:55.970\nI'm copying the Google Chrome app\ninto the Applications Folder.\n\n568\n00:29:55.970 --> 00:29:57.980\nIf it already exists,\n\n569\n00:29:57.980 --> 00:30:03.060\nwell, I wanna replace it,\nunless they've got a newer version.\n\n570\n00:30:03.060 --> 00:30:05.660\nSo I'm gonna say replace\nif existing item is older.\n\n571\n00:30:05.660 --> 00:30:08.870\nIf they've got an older copy of Chrome,\ngo ahead and replace it or\n\n572\n00:30:08.870 --> 00:30:10.500\nif they don't have it, install it.\n\n573\n00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:12.370\nBut if they got a new version of Chrome,\ndon't mess with it.\n\n574\n00:30:12.370 --> 00:30:14.550\nThey've got a newer one,\nI'm fine with that.\n\n575\n00:30:14.550 --> 00:30:18.440\nSet the item ownership, we'll leave that\nat the destination folders permissions,\n\n576\n00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:20.250\nI'm not gonna mess with that.\n\n577\n00:30:20.250 --> 00:30:22.550\nAnd then the other options here\nare all very similar, right.\n\n578\n00:30:22.550 --> 00:30:24.732\nI can actually tell it after copying\nto open the item, to go ahead and\n\n579\n00:30:24.732 --> 00:30:25.850\nlaunch Chrome.\n\n580\n00:30:25.850 --> 00:30:28.170\nThis would be useful if I was\ncopying a script to the machine and\n\n581\n00:30:28.170 --> 00:30:30.460\nI wanted the script to\nrun after it was copied.\n\n582\n00:30:30.460 --> 00:30:32.589\nSo I could say open it, and\nthen that script would run.\n\n583\n00:30:33.790 --> 00:30:37.169\nAnd then we can limit our network\nusage and I can pick my client.\n\n584\n00:30:37.169 --> 00:30:41.328\nOkay, so I'm gonna pick that\nOSXCLIENT01 and I'm gonna hit Copy, so\n\n585\n00:30:41.328 --> 00:30:43.110\nthat's gonna copy right now.\n\n586\n00:30:43.110 --> 00:30:45.550\nIt's reaching out and\nit's gonna send it over.\n\n587\n00:30:45.550 --> 00:30:50.510\nAll right, now when I did VirtualBox,\nI told it to restart.\n\n588\n00:30:50.510 --> 00:30:53.540\nIf that machine had restarted,\nit wouldn't show as available here.\n\n589\n00:30:53.540 --> 00:30:55.840\nAnd this job would be kind of frozen,\nit would wait and\n\n590\n00:30:55.840 --> 00:30:58.120\nI have to retry the job\nto install it later.\n\n591\n00:30:58.120 --> 00:31:01.351\nSo it's cool if all of your Macs aren't\non right now, you gonna always just come\n\n592\n00:31:01.351 --> 00:31:04.640\nback and restart the ones that were off\nlater, and they'll get that application.\n\n593\n00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:08.110\nBut I see it succeeded, and so\nnow I should have Chrome and\n\n594\n00:31:08.110 --> 00:31:09.770\nVirtualBox in that client.\n\n595\n00:31:09.770 --> 00:31:13.200\nI'm using my should operator to\ngive me a little bit of leeway,\n\n596\n00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:14.930\nbut let's go find out.\n\n597\n00:31:15.930 --> 00:31:19.130\nSo on my client, the client did\nreboot cuz I'm at the lock screen.\n\n598\n00:31:19.130 --> 00:31:20.950\nRight, and so, I'm gonna log in as me.\n\n599\n00:31:23.230 --> 00:31:26.670\nAnd it doesn't look any different.\n\n600\n00:31:26.670 --> 00:31:30.407\nRight, but if I go into my\nApplications Folder, or my launchpad or\n\n601\n00:31:30.407 --> 00:31:32.410\nhowever I wanna get there.\n\n602\n00:31:32.410 --> 00:31:34.920\nWhen I go to my applications,\nright off the bat,\n\n603\n00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:39.880\nI can see Chrome, oops,\nif I can stop scrolling like a mad man.\n\n604\n00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:43.125\nI've got Google Chrome right there and\nif I keep scrolling down,\n\n605\n00:31:43.125 --> 00:31:44.722\nthere's VirtualBox, right?\n\n606\n00:31:44.722 --> 00:31:47.512\nSo I've got these\napplications installed and\n\n607\n00:31:47.512 --> 00:31:50.250\nI didn't have to update\na NetInstall image.\n\n608\n00:31:50.250 --> 00:31:53.807\nI didn't have to redeploy NetRestore or\nanything like that I just pushed\n\n609\n00:31:53.807 --> 00:31:56.740\nthe application, it's out there and\nthere it is, right?\n\n610\n00:31:56.740 --> 00:32:02.690\nSo that's another cool feature of ARD,\nit can do a lot of stuff, right?\n\n611\n00:32:02.690 --> 00:32:04.830\nYou can even run Unix commands with this.\n\n612\n00:32:04.830 --> 00:32:09.770\nSo if I wanna see what version\nof the Linux current RU,\n\n613\n00:32:09.770 --> 00:32:11.370\nBSD current it's got right?\n\n614\n00:32:11.370 --> 00:32:14.600\nI can choose that client and\nI can hit the Unix button and\n\n615\n00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:17.494\nI can give it a UNIX command like UNAME-A,\nright?\n\n616\n00:32:17.494 --> 00:32:20.900\nAnd I can tell it who I want it to\nrun it as, rude or a current user or\n\n617\n00:32:20.900 --> 00:32:24.790\nwhatever, and we're going to display\nthat output and I can send it, and\n\n618\n00:32:24.790 --> 00:32:26.910\nit's going to run it and\nhere's the output right here.\n\n619\n00:32:26.910 --> 00:32:30.240\nIt ran the command on the client and\nthis is what it got back, right?\n\n620\n00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:33.600\nSo you can run command line utilities,\nscripts, you can do all sorts of crazy\n\n621\n00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:38.470\nthings, all remotely, which is really\none of the big advantages of ARD.\n\n622\n00:32:39.710 --> 00:32:42.440\nThe other thing, I know we're short on\ntime, Wes is giving me the eye over here.\n\n623\n00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:45.940\nBut one other thing I need to point out,\ncuz it turns up on the exam,\n\n624\n00:32:45.940 --> 00:32:50.430\nis a really useful feature of ARD,\nis the reporting piece, right?\n\n625\n00:32:50.430 --> 00:32:52.880\nThat we might need to gather\ninformation about our systems.\n\n626\n00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:56.330\nMaybe a new version of OSX comes out,\nright?\n\n627\n00:32:56.330 --> 00:33:01.650\nSo OS 10,\nI can't think of any more national parks.\n\n628\n00:33:01.650 --> 00:33:04.460\nSo anyhow, something,\nOcala National Forest.\n\n629\n00:33:04.460 --> 00:33:05.065\n>> There we go.\n\n630\n00:33:05.065 --> 00:33:06.590\n>> [LAUGH] Terrible name for a park.\n\n631\n00:33:06.590 --> 00:33:09.580\nBut so anyhow, that version comes out.\n\n632\n00:33:09.580 --> 00:33:12.480\nI wanna see what hardware I've got\nout there that can support it.\n\n633\n00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:17.180\nSo you've got a whole reporting piece in\nhere, which you see right here, reports.\n\n634\n00:33:17.180 --> 00:33:21.570\nAnd you can click on that and see all\nthe different reports that we can run.\n\n635\n00:33:21.570 --> 00:33:24.390\nWe can look for files present on systems.\n\n636\n00:33:24.390 --> 00:33:29.350\nI can look for software versions or\nsoftware differences, memory reports.\n\n637\n00:33:29.350 --> 00:33:32.610\nYou can pull up hardware data there,\nnetwork interfaces,\n\n638\n00:33:32.610 --> 00:33:34.160\nadministration settings.\n\n639\n00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:38.010\nYou can look for all sort of things\nacross all the computers in your network.\n\n640\n00:33:38.010 --> 00:33:40.680\nSo, for example, there was a hot news\n\n641\n00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:45.490\nitem last week about a ransomware\nthat was out there for Macs.\n\n642\n00:33:45.490 --> 00:33:47.840\nAnd so, on my Macs, I might know that hey,\n\n643\n00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:50.510\nthat ransomware was a part of\napplication called transmission.\n\n644\n00:33:50.510 --> 00:33:53.029\nSo, I wanna find every computer\nthat's running transmission.\n\n645\n00:33:54.310 --> 00:33:58.460\nI could come in here and\nI could do a Software Version Report and\n\n646\n00:33:58.460 --> 00:34:02.110\nI could look for people that were running\ntransmission and see what version it was.\n\n647\n00:34:02.110 --> 00:34:03.380\nI'd see all their software.\n\n648\n00:34:03.380 --> 00:34:06.650\nOr I could do a file search and\nI could look specifically for\n\n649\n00:34:06.650 --> 00:34:07.600\nthat file name right?\n\n650\n00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:11.130\nBecause it was Transmission.app, right?\n\n651\n00:34:11.130 --> 00:34:16.140\nSo I could look for\nTransmission.app on everybody's system and\n\n652\n00:34:16.140 --> 00:34:19.210\nI can have it returned,\nI don't necessarily care about the path.\n\n653\n00:34:19.210 --> 00:34:20.690\nRight?\n\n654\n00:34:20.690 --> 00:34:23.140\nBut, what I care about\nis the version number.\n\n655\n00:34:23.140 --> 00:34:27.250\nSo, I can say get me that file, get me the\ndate modified, get me the version number.\n\n656\n00:34:27.250 --> 00:34:30.740\nUnless you're sure, cuz I need to look for\neverybody who's got that and\n\n657\n00:34:30.740 --> 00:34:32.070\nit's compromised.\n\n658\n00:34:32.070 --> 00:34:35.670\nNow, I don't have that on my machine so\nmaybe I wanna look for iBooks or whatever.\n\n659\n00:34:35.670 --> 00:34:38.290\nYou can specify those\nfiles you wanna look for.\n\n660\n00:34:38.290 --> 00:34:41.670\nAnd what it's gonna do is search\nacross all the machines you select.\n\n661\n00:34:41.670 --> 00:34:44.590\nAnd when you run that\nsearch it's gonna look and\n\n662\n00:34:44.590 --> 00:34:47.200\nit's gonna see if it can\nfind that on those machines.\n\n663\n00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:50.240\nNow these reports can take a little\nwhile cuz it's got to reach out and\n\n664\n00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:54.310\nsearch all of those machines so they may\nstay in your active tasks for a while.\n\n665\n00:34:54.310 --> 00:34:57.160\nSome of the other reports happen really\nfast cuz we already have the data.\n\n666\n00:34:57.160 --> 00:35:01.440\nSo like if I go back in reports and\nI pull something like a just a straight up\n\n667\n00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:04.200\nsoftware version report and\nI wanna look for\n\n668\n00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:09.460\nthe software version for, you know I did a\nsearch for iBooks and is it, there it is.\n\n669\n00:35:09.460 --> 00:35:11.360\nSoftware version for iBooks, there we go.\n\n670\n00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:11.880\nOn these guys,\n\n671\n00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:15.920\nI can generate that report and this\nreport will usually happen much faster.\n\n672\n00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:18.680\nAnd so, once that's done it'll pop up and\nI'll get that report.\n\n673\n00:35:18.680 --> 00:35:21.380\nBut, actually it looks like it's\nstuck collecting the other data.\n\n674\n00:35:21.380 --> 00:35:24.060\nSo, we just kind of let it run,\nand it'll get that information.\n\n675\n00:35:24.060 --> 00:35:26.750\nAnd when it's done,\nit'll show up down here on my history.\n\n676\n00:35:26.750 --> 00:35:29.050\nAnd I can view that report,\nand get that information.\n\n677\n00:35:29.050 --> 00:35:31.900\nSo the reporting piece is really,\nreally useful.\n\n678\n00:35:31.900 --> 00:35:34.490\n>> Great information in\nour Mac management basics.\n\n679\n00:35:34.490 --> 00:35:37.520\nWe've looked at the power\nof Apple remote desktop.\n\n680\n00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:38.760\nSome of the things that we can do.\n\n681\n00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:40.390\nKeep in mind, it's great for help desks.\n\n682\n00:35:40.390 --> 00:35:42.710\nLab environments for things like teachers.\n\n683\n00:35:42.710 --> 00:35:44.920\nSoftware and update deployment as well.\n\n684\n00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:45.910\nTask automation.\n\n685\n00:35:45.910 --> 00:35:47.250\nWe finish with reports.\n\n686\n00:35:47.250 --> 00:35:49.180\nDon, got anything else for us on this one?\n\n687\n00:35:49.180 --> 00:35:50.800\n>> I know you hate it when I do this, Wes.\n\n688\n00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:53.010\nBut I just wanted to show real quick.\n\n689\n00:35:53.010 --> 00:35:55.480\nSo the reports did finish.\n\n690\n00:35:55.480 --> 00:35:56.360\nAnd so they popped up.\n\n691\n00:35:56.360 --> 00:35:59.660\nAnd so right here I can see,\nhere's that software version report.\n\n692\n00:35:59.660 --> 00:36:02.710\nAnd OSX-CLIENT01 has iBooks,\nit's version 1.4.\n\n693\n00:36:02.710 --> 00:36:05.050\nHere I could see a list\nof all my computers and\n\n694\n00:36:05.050 --> 00:36:06.970\nthe version of iBooks\non every one of them.\n\n695\n00:36:06.970 --> 00:36:09.560\nAnd in the background here,\nhere's that File Search that I did.\n\n696\n00:36:09.560 --> 00:36:12.536\nAnd I can see OSX-CLIENT01\nhas the iBooks.app, or\n\n697\n00:36:12.536 --> 00:36:14.470\ntransmission.app, or whatever.\n\n698\n00:36:14.470 --> 00:36:15.970\nAnd the version number that it tracks,\nactually,\n\n699\n00:36:15.970 --> 00:36:17.730\nversion number would be way over here.\n\n700\n00:36:17.730 --> 00:36:18.550\nSo I can get it that way too.\n\n701\n00:36:18.550 --> 00:36:20.680\nSo all different ways to use the reports.\n\n702\n00:36:20.680 --> 00:36:24.640\nThe other thing that I forgot to mention\nis I showed you how to send a message from\n\n703\n00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:26.300\na remote desktop to a client like a popup.\n\n704\n00:36:26.300 --> 00:36:28.380\nBut there's a chat also.\n\n705\n00:36:28.380 --> 00:36:30.750\nAnd I didn't show you the chat and\nit can turn up on the exam.\n\n706\n00:36:30.750 --> 00:36:32.370\nSo just real quick.\n\n707\n00:36:32.370 --> 00:36:38.000\nIn ARD if you pick a client, in your menus\nup top there's a menu labeled interact and\n\n708\n00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:42.390\nwhen you go into interact there's\nthe control stuff, but there's also chat.\n\n709\n00:36:42.390 --> 00:36:44.520\nAnd that's where you can\nenter into the chat.\n\n710\n00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:47.160\nAnd you can say, you know,\nhey, how you doing?\n\n711\n00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:48.670\nOr whatever it is that you want to do.\n\n712\n00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:52.750\nSo we can punch that in, right?\n\n713\n00:36:52.750 --> 00:36:54.230\nAnd now I'm in a two way chat.\n\n714\n00:36:54.230 --> 00:36:55.880\nSo if I go take a look\nat the other client.\n\n715\n00:36:55.880 --> 00:36:58.070\nWhoops, which I just closed it,\nthere we go.\n\n716\n00:36:58.070 --> 00:37:00.050\nThey've got the chat.\n\n717\n00:37:00.050 --> 00:37:03.770\nAnd they can respond I've having issues.\n\n718\n00:37:03.770 --> 00:37:05.580\nAnd you get a two-way chat, so\nyou don't have to pick up the phone and\n\n719\n00:37:05.580 --> 00:37:06.160\ntalk to these people.\n\n720\n00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:07.840\nYou can just do it right through chat,\n\n721\n00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:10.670\nhelp them out, remote control their\nmachine and get it all solved.\n\n722\n00:37:10.670 --> 00:37:13.760\nSo all a part of ARD,\nreally a neat product to us.\n\n723\n00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:15.700\n>> Lot of great information in this one,\nDon.\n\n724\n00:37:15.700 --> 00:37:18.460\nAnd we still got a lot of\ngreat information coming in\n\n725\n00:37:18.460 --> 00:37:20.730\nfuture episodes of Mac Management Basics.\n\n726\n00:37:20.730 --> 00:37:23.010\nBut it looks like we're going to have\nto save that for another episode.\n\n727\n00:37:23.010 --> 00:37:25.270\nSo we're going to go ahead and\nsign off here at IT PRO TV.\n\n728\n00:37:25.270 --> 00:37:27.130\nI've been your host Wes Bryan.\n\n729\n00:37:27.130 --> 00:37:27.760\n>> And I'm Don Peset.\n\n730\n00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:29.927\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n731\n00:37:29.927 --> 00:37:31.240\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:16.680\nI'm your host Wes Bryan and\n\n4\n00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.020\nin today's episode we're moving\nthrough our Mac management basics.\n\n5\n00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.380\nWe got non other than Mr. Don Pezet here.\n\n6\n00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:23.530\nDon, how you doing Sir?\n\n7\n00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:24.470\n>> I'm doing great, Wes,\n\n8\n00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.530\nready to jump right back into\nthe world of Mac management basics.\n\n9\n00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:28.450\nAnd in this episode,\n\n10\n00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:31.300\nwe're actually gonna go a little\nbit off the exam objective track.\n\n11\n00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.210\nSo normally we make our episodes\nwhere they really do align with\n\n12\n00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:36.490\nthe exam objectives so\nyou learn everything you need to do.\n\n13\n00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:40.080\nThe next thing that's coming\nup is the profile manager and\n\n14\n00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.650\nit's a really important tool,\nthere's a lot of ins and outs of it, so\n\n15\n00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:44.450\nwe wanna spend some time on it.\n\n16\n00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.740\nBut you can't deploy the profile\nmanager without having a good\n\n17\n00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:53.730\nOpen Directory set up and open directory\nis not technically on the exam objectives.\n\n18\n00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.460\nBut if you don't know how to set it up,\n\n19\n00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.220\nit's kind of hard to get\nthe profile manager working.\n\n20\n00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.580\nSo I wanted to spend a little extra time,\nand just go off the beaten path and\n\n21\n00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:04.310\ntake a look at open directory and how\nit works, and how we can get it set up.\n\n22\n00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:06.776\nNow, if you've never heard of\nthe Open Directory before,\n\n23\n00:01:06.776 --> 00:01:09.740\nlet me just start off really\nbasic here with the heck it is.\n\n24\n00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.112\nNormally, when you set up a Mac, you\ncreate a user account with that Mac, so\n\n25\n00:01:13.112 --> 00:01:15.660\nthat you can log in to it and\nwork with it.\n\n26\n00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:18.650\nWell, if you get up,\nwalk across your office and\n\n27\n00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.775\nsit down somebody else's computer,\ncan you log in with that account?\n\n28\n00:01:22.775 --> 00:01:25.170\nNo, accounts on a Mac\nare local by default.\n\n29\n00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.020\nThey're local accounts, and\n\n30\n00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.990\nthat means they only work on the computer\nthey're created on, and that's it.\n\n31\n00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:31.510\nAnd for a home user, that's fine,\n\n32\n00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:33.980\nor if you have a dedicated computer,\nthat's fine.\n\n33\n00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:34.520\nBut in an office,\n\n34\n00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.220\nwhere you might have hundreds or thousands\nof computers, in an environment where\n\n35\n00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.830\nyou have shared computers where\nmore than one person uses it.\n\n36\n00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.300\nIt starts to become really\nchallenging to manage and\n\n37\n00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:48.190\nmaintain those local accounts and so\nwhat Open Directory does is it creates\n\n38\n00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:53.610\na centralized database, one big place\nwhen we create our user accounts.\n\n39\n00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:59.290\nAnd then I can log in on any Mac in my\ncompany using the exact same user account.\n\n40\n00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:02.610\nSo centralized user account database,\nthat's what Open Directory is all about.\n\n41\n00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.080\nAnd Open Directory's not the only\nsolution that's out there,\n\n42\n00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.430\nthere's a ton of them, but\nthis is the one that's from Apple.\n\n43\n00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:09.440\nSo in this episode we're gonna\nget a chance to see how to set up\n\n44\n00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.719\nthe Open Directory and\njust kind of see it in action.\n\n45\n00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.780\nNow when it comes to deploying this,\n\n46\n00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.780\nthere are a few things that we need to be\naware of, some little basic knowledge that\n\n47\n00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.900\nwe need to have, and it could be that\nyou don't even need Open Directory.\n\n48\n00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.710\nAnd what I mean by that is you may\nalready have a directory service in\n\n49\n00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:25.660\nyour environment.\n\n50\n00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.010\nYou don't have to have\nApple's Open Directory.\n\n51\n00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.030\nYou could use\nMicrosoft's Active Directory, for example.\n\n52\n00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.150\nThat's very prominent out\nthere in the business world.\n\n53\n00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.220\nIf you want to learn more about that one,\n\n54\n00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.630\nwe're gonna cover it in the Mac\nintegration basic series.\n\n55\n00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.670\nThat's where we focus on integrating Macs\nwith Windows, so we'll see it more there.\n\n56\n00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.413\nHere, I wanted to focus\non the Apple side of it,\n\n57\n00:02:42.413 --> 00:02:45.310\nbecause this is Mac management basics,\nnot Windows management basics.\n\n58\n00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.610\nSo, we're going to take\na look at the Open Directory.\n\n59\n00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.970\nBut Open Directory is actually very\nsimilar to Microsoft's Active Directory.\n\n60\n00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.620\nThey both work with an underlying\nprotocol called LDAP.\n\n61\n00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.210\nAnd LDAP is\nthe Lightweight Directory Access Protocol.\n\n62\n00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:02.510\nIt's an open standard that\nanybody can use, and as you see,\n\n63\n00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.800\nmost people are, that allows you to\nhave a database with user accounts and\n\n64\n00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.700\nthen your clients can query that database.\n\n65\n00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.980\nSo when your computer boots up and\nasks for a username it's not looking for\n\n66\n00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.640\na local user name, it's looking for\none in a database across the network.\n\n67\n00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.990\nAnd it uses LDAP to reach out to that\nserver to ask it that question and say,\n\n68\n00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:23.640\nhey, I just got a username and\npassword, is this valid?\n\n69\n00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:24.360\n>> Very good, Don.\n\n70\n00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.750\nOne of the things that we know\nabout like the Macintosh or\n\n71\n00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:32.540\nMac systems is that under the hood as\nyou've shown us with the terminal and\n\n72\n00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.010\neverything they're Unix based, right?\n\n73\n00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:37.490\nSo they spring off of an operating\nsystem that's been around there for\n\n74\n00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:38.695\na long time now.\n\n75\n00:03:38.695 --> 00:03:41.735\nOpen Directory's got some\nsimilarity to that, right?\n\n76\n00:03:41.735 --> 00:03:44.885\nIt springs off of an underlying\ntechnology as well, right?\n\n77\n00:03:44.885 --> 00:03:46.705\n>> Yeah,\nApple didn't write this one from scratch.\n\n78\n00:03:46.705 --> 00:03:49.615\nAnd most of the server apps aren't written\nfrom scratch, some of them are, but\n\n79\n00:03:49.615 --> 00:03:50.875\nmost of them aren't.\n\n80\n00:03:50.875 --> 00:03:53.860\nOpen Directory is one of\nthose where it isn't.\n\n81\n00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:55.830\nIn the open source world,\nlike in the Linux and\n\n82\n00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:58.920\nUnix world,\nthere's a product called Open LDAP.\n\n83\n00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.320\nAnd it's just a open source Lightweight\nDirectory Access Protocol Server,\n\n84\n00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:03.690\nan open LDAP server.\n\n85\n00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:07.090\nAnd so when Apple created their directory,\nthey just took Open LDAP and\n\n86\n00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:08.660\nmodified it to suit their needs.\n\n87\n00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:10.550\nThey call that forking the software.\n\n88\n00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:14.630\nSo they split it off the main Open LDAP\nproject and created Open Directory.\n\n89\n00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:17.400\nNow what they've ended up with is\n\n90\n00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.230\nsomething that's now\ntechnically proprietary.\n\n91\n00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:22.490\nActive Directory is\nproprietary to Microsoft,\n\n92\n00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:24.782\nOpen Directory is proprietary to Apple.\n\n93\n00:04:24.782 --> 00:04:27.350\nOpen LDAP, that's an open standard,\n\n94\n00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:30.820\nyou can run it anywhere and\nit's not proprietary to anybody.\n\n95\n00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:32.970\nNow all three of them\nare compatible though.\n\n96\n00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:35.754\nYou can actually get all three of\nthem to talk to each other and\n\n97\n00:04:35.754 --> 00:04:39.300\nthey work just fine because deep down\nunder the hood all through using the LDAP\n\n98\n00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:42.212\nprotocols or using standards\nbased communications, right?\n\n99\n00:04:42.212 --> 00:04:46.685\nWe have LDAP for doing our lookup or\nKerberos or Kerberos or however you want\n\n100\n00:04:46.685 --> 00:04:50.805\nto say it for doing authentication\nwhich Microsoft uses by default,\n\n101\n00:04:50.805 --> 00:04:54.460\nApple uses by default, and\nOpen LDAP makes use of also.\n\n102\n00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:58.620\nSo it's all nice and\nstandards based, makes it kinda easy.\n\n103\n00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:01.570\nSo when we turn on Open Directory\non our Apple machines,\n\n104\n00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:04.530\nwhat we're actually doing in\nthe background is turning on a modified\n\n105\n00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:06.490\nversion of Open LDAP,\nthat's where this all stems from.\n\n106\n00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:10.780\nAll right, now one of the biggest\nadvantages of doing this,\n\n107\n00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:13.390\ncuz some of you guys might be asking\nabout that right now, thinking well,\n\n108\n00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:15.070\nDon, this sounds like a lot.\n\n109\n00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:16.240\nI don't wanna mess with it.\n\n110\n00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.800\nI can just create local accounts and\nrun that way, right?\n\n111\n00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.340\nLet me give you a few scenarios where\nthis really, really makes it valuable.\n\n112\n00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:27.194\nLet's say you've got 1,000 computers and\n\n113\n00:05:27.194 --> 00:05:32.254\nyou're hiring a new person and\nthey're gonna start on Monday.\n\n114\n00:05:32.254 --> 00:05:34.500\nAnd so you need to create\na user account for them, but\n\n115\n00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:37.380\nyou don't know what computer\nthey're gonna use, right?\n\n116\n00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:40.020\nI don't know what computer they're gonna\nbe on but I need to create this account.\n\n117\n00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:44.060\nWell, if I had a central database I can\njust go and create it in the database.\n\n118\n00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:47.430\nI don't have to go and\ncreate it on a particular computer.\n\n119\n00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:50.455\nNow they can go to any computer and\nlog in and it's gonna work.\n\n120\n00:05:50.455 --> 00:05:53.170\nWhat if I want to reset my password?\n\n121\n00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:55.130\nMaybe I have a local accounts,\n\n122\n00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:57.780\nin this room right now I\nsee three computers right?\n\n123\n00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:01.480\nSo I go and create a user account for\nDon Pezet on computer one, computer two,\n\n124\n00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:02.900\ncomputer three.\n\n125\n00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:03.720\nAnd then one day I say,\n\n126\n00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:07.162\nyou know my password's kind of weak,\nI wanna change my password.\n\n127\n00:06:07.162 --> 00:06:08.970\nI've gotta go computer one, computer two,\n\n128\n00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:11.630\ncomputer three and\nI’ve gotta change in all three places.\n\n129\n00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:15.490\nWhat if a thousand computers, I'd have to\ngo and chase it in a thousand places, and\n\n130\n00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:17.290\nthat's not fun at all.\n\n131\n00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:18.190\nWell, I'll go back to that.\n\n132\n00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:21.130\nAnd unless you're an hourly employee,\nthen it's great.\n\n133\n00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:22.810\nSo for most of us we don't want that.\n\n134\n00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:26.640\nIf I had a central database, I just go and\nchange the password in one place.\n\n135\n00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:27.820\nI change it in that database, and\n\n136\n00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:30.890\nnow it's changed everywhere,\nthat makes life a lot easier.\n\n137\n00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:33.700\nFrom an administrative stand\npoint it's also great when\n\n138\n00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:35.330\nyou need to disable an account.\n\n139\n00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:37.620\nLet's say you have a disgruntled employee,\nright?\n\n140\n00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:41.940\nSomebody's angry and so they get fired,\nthey get escorted out of the building.\n\n141\n00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:44.310\nWell, they could sneak right back in and\nlog in on a computer and\n\n142\n00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:45.320\nstart doing some damage.\n\n143\n00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:48.000\nSo I need to disable their\naccount as quickly as possible.\n\n144\n00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.650\nIf they've got an account\non 1,000 computers\n\n145\n00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:52.710\nI can't do that very quickly, can I?\n\n146\n00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:54.110\nBut if this is a centralized database,\n\n147\n00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:57.100\nI just go to the database,\ntake that user, disable them, right?\n\n148\n00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:59.700\nAnd delete them, change their password,\nwhatever it is you wanna do.\n\n149\n00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:01.850\nAny of those will lock that person out and\n\n150\n00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:04.570\nnow they can't get into the system again,\nright?\n\n151\n00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:08.730\nSo those are all advantages of\nhaving a centralized directory and\n\n152\n00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:09.890\nthe Apple's Open Directory does that.\n\n153\n00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:13.270\nThe Open Directory is part\nof the server app, so\n\n154\n00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:14.500\ngetting it installed is super easy.\n\n155\n00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:16.780\nYou just install the server app,\nand you've got it.\n\n156\n00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:20.120\nSo if we take a look at my server here,\nI haven't configured it on this one,\n\n157\n00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:21.210\nI just fired it up.\n\n158\n00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:26.130\nHere's my server app and Open Directory\nis actually part of the Advanced servers.\n\n159\n00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:29.350\nSo, it's hidden by default,\nyou'll have to expand that out.\n\n160\n00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:33.200\nAnd then you'll see Open Directory\nright there on the list, right?\n\n161\n00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:38.980\nNow, the Open Directory is turned\noff by default and with a lot\n\n162\n00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:44.500\nof the servers here you can normally kind\nof configure them and then turn them on.\n\n163\n00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:45.810\nOpen Directory is a little bit different.\n\n164\n00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:48.910\nIt makes you turn on first and\nthen configure it.\n\n165\n00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:51.550\nSo it's a little bit backwards compared\nto some of the other services.\n\n166\n00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:55.199\nSo, when you go to set this up your first\nstep is really just to hit that On button,\n\n167\n00:07:55.199 --> 00:07:57.202\neven before you've done a configuration.\n\n168\n00:07:57.202 --> 00:07:58.329\nAnd the reason is,\n\n169\n00:07:58.329 --> 00:08:02.994\nit's going to then pop up the wizard\nthat walks us through the configuration.\n\n170\n00:08:02.994 --> 00:08:06.838\nOpen Directory is one of the more\ndifficult ones to get set up because it's\n\n171\n00:08:06.838 --> 00:08:09.090\njust a lot of questions that it asks.\n\n172\n00:08:09.090 --> 00:08:11.810\nMost of the other services,\nyou can kinda stumble through them,\n\n173\n00:08:11.810 --> 00:08:13.200\nlike I wanna configure mail.\n\n174\n00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:17.740\nSo I'll just turn it on and fumble through\nthe options until we get it right.\n\n175\n00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:19.170\nAnd it's not that hard.\n\n176\n00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:23.810\nOpen Directory, you can make mistakes\nearly on that can't be fixed,\n\n177\n00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:26.230\nthat break the directory,\nthat break the functionality.\n\n178\n00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:29.750\nSo we need to make sure we understand each\ndecision along the way that we're making.\n\n179\n00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:31.130\nAnd so it is a little bit different.\n\n180\n00:08:31.130 --> 00:08:33.690\nAnd that's why I wanted to spend some\ntime in this episode covering it,\n\n181\n00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:36.580\neven though it's not on\nthe exam objectives, all right.\n\n182\n00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:38.822\nThe first thing your gonna\nsee when you launch this is,\n\n183\n00:08:38.822 --> 00:08:40.585\nit's gonna ask what you're trying to do.\n\n184\n00:08:40.585 --> 00:08:44.360\nAre you trying to create\na new Open Directory domain?\n\n185\n00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:45.710\nThat's usually what we want.\n\n186\n00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:49.635\nA domain, think of domain as like that\nthat database, the database of users.\n\n187\n00:08:49.635 --> 00:08:51.150\nSo we have a domain,\n\n188\n00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:55.840\nit's a name that identifies the users\nthat are grouped together, right.\n\n189\n00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:57.000\nWhen I create a new database,\n\n190\n00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.200\nI'm creating a new Open Directory\ndomain to gather these users together.\n\n191\n00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:04.836\nI could join an existing\nOpen Directory domain.\n\n192\n00:09:04.836 --> 00:09:08.491\nWhich means I've already got Open\nDirectory configured somewhere else, and\n\n193\n00:09:08.491 --> 00:09:09.330\nI want a replica.\n\n194\n00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:13.290\nWhen you configure your first\nOpen Directory server it's called\n\n195\n00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:14.260\na master, right?\n\n196\n00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:17.140\nIt's the one that's in\ncharge of that database.\n\n197\n00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:19.670\nWell, what happens if your master fails?\n\n198\n00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:23.656\nIf the master fails and all of my\nuser accounts were on that master,\n\n199\n00:09:23.656 --> 00:09:27.410\nI can't log in to my Macs anymore, right?\n\n200\n00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:31.680\nI might have 1,000 Macs on my network,\nand now I can't log in to any of them.\n\n201\n00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:33.850\nThat's not where we wanna be, right?\n\n202\n00:09:33.850 --> 00:09:38.330\nSo it is a rare day that you deploy\njust one Open Directory server.\n\n203\n00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:40.820\nI mean, you gotta be really\nconfident in your network, and\n\n204\n00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:44.090\nreally confident in your career\n[LAUGH] to just have one of these.\n\n205\n00:09:44.090 --> 00:09:45.090\nYou're going to want more.\n\n206\n00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:49.010\n>> Now Don, the replica, is that a\nread-only copy or is that a writable copy\n\n207\n00:09:49.010 --> 00:09:53.730\nof that centralized database that's so\nimportant that we maintain redundancy?\n\n208\n00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:57.279\n>> So it is just readable, right,\nso when you, I shouldn't say right.\n\n209\n00:09:57.279 --> 00:10:03.100\n[LAUGH] So when you have a database,\nyou need consistent writes to a database.\n\n210\n00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:08.120\nWhat if I go to two different computers\nand, or maybe Wes knows my password.\n\n211\n00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:10.419\nAnd he sits down on one computer and\nhe goes to change my password and\n\n212\n00:10:10.419 --> 00:10:12.608\nI sit down on another computer and\nI try and change my password.\n\n213\n00:10:12.608 --> 00:10:14.390\nWe try and change it at the same time.\n\n214\n00:10:14.390 --> 00:10:17.000\nWell, if we're writing to\nthe same database that's fine,\n\n215\n00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.900\nit's just the last one wins.\n\n216\n00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:20.930\nBut if we're writing to\ndifferent databases,\n\n217\n00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:22.950\nnow there's a conflict,\nthere's a challenge.\n\n218\n00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:25.340\nSo your master is the one that's\ngonna be doing all the work.\n\n219\n00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:27.820\nYour replicas are there for redundancy.\n\n220\n00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:31.020\nIf the master fails,\na replica can take over.\n\n221\n00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:33.200\nSo you're not allowed to write\nto the replica by default but\n\n222\n00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:34.480\nyou can read from it.\n\n223\n00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:35.680\nAnd that's exactly gonna happen.\n\n224\n00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:38.241\nWhen your master fails,\nall of your clients,\n\n225\n00:10:38.241 --> 00:10:41.865\nyou'll still be able to log in cuz\nthey can read from the replica.\n\n226\n00:10:41.865 --> 00:10:42.983\nAnd then you've got a choice.\n\n227\n00:10:42.983 --> 00:10:45.999\nYou can either go and fix your master and\nget it back online, or\n\n228\n00:10:45.999 --> 00:10:49.672\nyou can take one of your replicas and\npromote it up and make it into a master.\n\n229\n00:10:49.672 --> 00:10:53.358\nWhich goes beyond the scope of what\nwe're gonna do here in this show.\n\n230\n00:10:53.358 --> 00:10:57.966\nBut you'll see, if you go up to the more\nadvanced shows like the ACTC shows,\n\n231\n00:10:57.966 --> 00:10:59.625\nwe walk into how to do that.\n\n232\n00:10:59.625 --> 00:11:02.042\nBut that's kinda creating a replica,\nthat's out second option.\n\n233\n00:11:02.042 --> 00:11:05.650\nAnd the third one is Restore Open\nDirectory domain from an archive.\n\n234\n00:11:05.650 --> 00:11:08.617\nAnd I mentioned if your master fails,\nyou need to bring it back online,\n\n235\n00:11:08.617 --> 00:11:09.835\nthat's how you would do it.\n\n236\n00:11:09.835 --> 00:11:13.296\nYou'd be restoring a backup of your Open\nDirectory to get the master back online,\n\n237\n00:11:13.296 --> 00:11:14.340\nall right.\n\n238\n00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:15.770\nSo for your first server,\n\n239\n00:11:15.770 --> 00:11:19.239\nyou're gonna want this one right here,\nCreate a new Open Directory domain.\n\n240\n00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:24.790\nOn the next screen it's gonna ask\nme to set up an admin account.\n\n241\n00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:26.536\nI need to have an administrator\nin this domain so\n\n242\n00:11:26.536 --> 00:11:27.809\nthat I'll be able to work with it.\n\n243\n00:11:27.809 --> 00:11:32.860\nAnd the default is Directory Administrator\nwith an account name of diradmin.\n\n244\n00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:36.460\nYou can leave it that way, but,\n\n245\n00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:38.930\neverybody on the Internet knows\nthis account exists, right?\n\n246\n00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:42.090\nEverybody who can do two\nseconds of Google searching or\n\n247\n00:11:42.090 --> 00:11:46.640\nread Apple's documentation will know that\nthere's a directory admin called dradmin.\n\n248\n00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:48.620\nSo here's my chance to change\nthat to something else,\n\n249\n00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:52.010\nif I wanna name it something else to\nmake it a little harder to guess, right?\n\n250\n00:11:52.010 --> 00:11:55.780\nSo I might wanna call this one,\nitprotvadmin, or\n\n251\n00:11:55.780 --> 00:11:57.880\nsomething completely unrelated.\n\n252\n00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:00.520\nMaybe I just want it to be me,\nor a fake name.\n\n253\n00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:03.870\nMaybe I want it to be Benjamin Franklin,\nright?\n\n254\n00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:06.178\nAnd so bfranklin, there.\n\n255\n00:12:06.178 --> 00:12:08.830\nSo there that's gonna be an administrator\naccount and I can remember that.\n\n256\n00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:10.280\nYeah, it's Benjamin Franklin.\n\n257\n00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:12.600\nBut, a hacker isn't gonna\nknow that I renamed it.\n\n258\n00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:15.160\nSo you can choose what you\nwant that account to be.\n\n259\n00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:18.330\n>> It sounds like this is in the lines of\nsome of the security, even though we're\n\n260\n00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:22.120\nnot really going into security in this\nepisode, of renaming defaults, right.\n\n261\n00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:24.950\nDoesn't matter if you got a wireless\naccess point, doesn't matter if you got\n\n262\n00:12:24.950 --> 00:12:28.136\na default admin account,\nhere we're always renaming those, right?\n\n263\n00:12:28.136 --> 00:12:31.140\n>> Absolutely, absolutely, all right,\nso I'm gonna hit Next on that one.\n\n264\n00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:35.440\nNow comes some important decisions,\nthings that I can't change after the fact,\n\n265\n00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:37.080\nlike my organization name.\n\n266\n00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:38.777\nWhen you set up an organization name,\n\n267\n00:12:38.777 --> 00:12:41.116\nthis is what is effectively\nthe name of your domain.\n\n268\n00:12:41.116 --> 00:12:46.100\nAnd, it can be changed after the fact,\nbut it's really, really hard to do it.\n\n269\n00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:47.820\nIt gets hooks into a lot of places.\n\n270\n00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:50.004\nSo we wanna make sure that\nwe have this stuff correct,\n\n271\n00:12:50.004 --> 00:12:51.857\nthat you name it the way\nthat you want it to be.\n\n272\n00:12:51.857 --> 00:12:56.260\nHere it's asking for the name of the\norganization, I'll just call mine ITProTV.\n\n273\n00:12:56.260 --> 00:13:01.035\nAnd for an admin email address, maybe\nI'll just put in myself, so don@itpro,\n\n274\n00:13:01.035 --> 00:13:02.590\nwhich I can sort of spell.\n\n275\n00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:04.650\nThere we go, itpro.tv, all right.\n\n276\n00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:08.030\nSo we get that punched in and\nthen we go to our next screen.\n\n277\n00:13:08.030 --> 00:13:12.030\nAnd now it's just kinda giving me that\nsummary of what we've defined and\n\n278\n00:13:12.030 --> 00:13:12.610\nwe'll set that up.\n\n279\n00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:17.656\nAll right, so now it's creating that\nOpen Directory in the background.\n\n280\n00:13:17.656 --> 00:13:22.526\nAnd as soon as that's done, I'll now be\nready to be that centralized database for\n\n281\n00:13:22.526 --> 00:13:23.240\nmy system.\n\n282\n00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:24.760\nNow it's gonna take it a moment.\n\n283\n00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:27.640\nIt's getting that created in\nthe background, it's setting it up,\n\n284\n00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:31.060\nit's getting things put in place and\nthen it's starting the services.\n\n285\n00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:34.410\nAnd so we can't really monitor the logs\nwhile this little window is up,\n\n286\n00:13:34.410 --> 00:13:36.390\nit's got us locked, but\nit doesn't take that long.\n\n287\n00:13:36.390 --> 00:13:40.760\nThere it goes, creating some default\naccounts, and it's done, there we go.\n\n288\n00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:42.910\nAnd so now I can see that I'm up and\nrunning.\n\n289\n00:13:42.910 --> 00:13:48.725\nHere's my Master server that we just made,\nwhich is just called OSX-SERVER01.local.\n\n290\n00:13:48.725 --> 00:13:50.015\nI left mine called .local,\n\n291\n00:13:50.015 --> 00:13:52.415\nyou could change it to something\nelse ahead of time if you want it.\n\n292\n00:13:52.415 --> 00:13:54.475\nAgain, we see that in the server shows.\n\n293\n00:13:54.475 --> 00:13:56.355\nBut there's my Master that's up and\n\n294\n00:13:56.355 --> 00:14:00.665\nI'm serving my Open Directory\nagainst all of my local networks.\n\n295\n00:14:00.665 --> 00:14:03.710\nThere's no other real\noptions in here to change.\n\n296\n00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:06.090\nIf I choose the Master I\ncan hit this gear and\n\n297\n00:14:06.090 --> 00:14:08.180\nyou can see where I can take an archive,\nright?\n\n298\n00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:10.092\nThat's how I can backup\nthe Open Directory.\n\n299\n00:14:10.092 --> 00:14:13.241\nAnd if this was a replica,\nI've got Promote Replica to Master,\n\n300\n00:14:13.241 --> 00:14:15.860\nright, that's how I\nwould bump a replica up.\n\n301\n00:14:15.860 --> 00:14:19.050\nBut other than that, there's not\nreally anything to change here.\n\n302\n00:14:19.050 --> 00:14:23.980\nOnce the Open Directory is up, really all\nthe work we do is adding user accounts and\n\n303\n00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:26.090\nadding groups and that's about it.\n\n304\n00:14:26.090 --> 00:14:30.490\nWhich we don't do from here, we actually\ndo from way up here, under Accounts.\n\n305\n00:14:30.490 --> 00:14:34.110\nNow, on a normal server, when you bring up\nthe server app the first time, the users\n\n306\n00:14:34.110 --> 00:14:39.330\nor groups that you create here are local\nusers and groups, just on that server.\n\n307\n00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:43.440\nBut now that I'm an Open Directory Master,\nwhen I go to create user accounts,\n\n308\n00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:44.920\nI'll have the choice.\n\n309\n00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:46.360\nDo I want to make it a network account or\n\n310\n00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:48.850\ndo I want it to be an account\nright here in this system?\n\n311\n00:14:48.850 --> 00:14:51.250\nAnd so,\nI'll have that choice as we set this up.\n\n312\n00:14:51.250 --> 00:14:54.720\nIn fact, notice here's that Don Pezet\naccount that I've been using this whole\n\n313\n00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:57.630\nshow, and\nit shows that I'm Local Directory.\n\n314\n00:14:58.650 --> 00:15:02.250\nBut then there's Benjamin Franklin\nthat we created in the wizard, and\n\n315\n00:15:02.250 --> 00:15:06.390\nit shows as Local Network Directory.\n\n316\n00:15:06.390 --> 00:15:08.650\nAll right, the difference there,\nLocal Directory,\n\n317\n00:15:08.650 --> 00:15:11.660\nthat just means that I'm\nin the Mac user database.\n\n318\n00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:15.166\nThe Local Network Directory\nmeans I'm in the Open Directory.\n\n319\n00:15:15.166 --> 00:15:18.556\nAnd so from now on when I create my user\naccounts, I don't wanna create them on\n\n320\n00:15:18.556 --> 00:15:21.268\nthe local system, I wanna create\nthem in the Open Directory so\n\n321\n00:15:21.268 --> 00:15:23.600\nthey can be shared across other systems.\n\n322\n00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:28.670\nSo for example, let's say that I want Wes\nto be able to log in on this machine,\n\n323\n00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:33.276\nor any of my machines, right,\nI want to create a user account for Wes.\n\n324\n00:15:33.276 --> 00:15:37.100\nSo I'm gonna go down here and hit Add,\nand when you got to add an account,\n\n325\n00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:38.820\nI've got this drop-down box.\n\n326\n00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:41.260\nNow, you don't get\nthe drop-down box normally.\n\n327\n00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:43.929\nIt's only once we've created the Open\nDirectory that we see this drop-down box.\n\n328\n00:15:43.929 --> 00:15:49.000\nAnd we can now pick, do I want this to\nbe a local account or a network account?\n\n329\n00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.940\nAnd I'm gonna create a network account for\nWes.\n\n330\n00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:56.385\nSo we'll get one put in here,\nwhich we'll just make you wbryan.\n\n331\n00:15:56.385 --> 00:15:58.729\nAnd if I've got his email address,\nI can put his email address in.\n\n332\n00:15:58.729 --> 00:16:00.444\nI can assign him a password.\n\n333\n00:16:00.444 --> 00:16:02.922\nWe'll go ahead and punch one of those in.\n\n334\n00:16:02.922 --> 00:16:07.820\nThere we go, and do I wanna allow\nhim to be an administrator?\n\n335\n00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:08.840\nI'll probably take a pass on that.\n\n336\n00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:09.955\nWes is kind of dangerous.\n\n337\n00:16:09.955 --> 00:16:11.840\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We'll do limited privileges.\n\n338\n00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:14.580\nNow, home folder,\nwhat's the home folder about?\n\n339\n00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:18.730\nWell, every user account gets a directory\nwhere they can store their stuff, and so\n\n340\n00:16:18.730 --> 00:16:24.010\nwhen I look at that, I've got two options\nhere, Local Only and None-Services Only.\n\n341\n00:16:24.010 --> 00:16:24.560\nAll right?\n\n342\n00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:27.890\nLocal Only means that Wes could sit\ndown on this computer, login, and\n\n343\n00:16:27.890 --> 00:16:28.910\nhave a directory.\n\n344\n00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:29.560\nRight?\n\n345\n00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:32.280\nWell, he's never gonna\nsit down ay this server.\n\n346\n00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:35.140\nHe's gonna use his laptop or\na desktop somewhere else.\n\n347\n00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:39.070\nSo, I could choose Services Only, which\nmeans he's not gonna have a folder here on\n\n348\n00:16:39.070 --> 00:16:43.080\nthe server, he's just gonna be able to\nlogin, which is normally what I'd want.\n\n349\n00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:46.600\nBut, maybe I want him to be an admin or\nwhatever, I'll choose that Local Only so\n\n350\n00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:47.290\nhe'll get a folder too.\n\n351\n00:16:49.010 --> 00:16:51.530\nWe can always change that after\nthe fact too if you want.\n\n352\n00:16:51.530 --> 00:16:55.600\nOnce that's created, now I've got\na Wes Bryan account right here, and\n\n353\n00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:59.580\nif I look over, he's not an admin,\nand it's a Local Network account.\n\n354\n00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:01.030\nRight?\nNetwork Directory Account.\n\n355\n00:17:03.130 --> 00:17:07.030\nAfter that's done, now I can get\nWes to login on my clients, and\n\n356\n00:17:07.030 --> 00:17:08.810\nhe doesn't have to have a local account.\n\n357\n00:17:08.810 --> 00:17:10.910\nHe can login through the directory, right?\n\n358\n00:17:10.910 --> 00:17:13.750\nWell there's exactly a little bit\nI needed to on with my clients.\n\n359\n00:17:13.750 --> 00:17:16.610\nThe clients don't know about\nthe directory by default, so\n\n360\n00:17:16.610 --> 00:17:20.730\nwhen they login on a client you just see\nthe local database and that's it, right?\n\n361\n00:17:20.730 --> 00:17:25.080\nIf I take my client here,\nlet's jump over this one, all right.\n\n362\n00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:27.520\nAnd this the client I've been using\nthrough each of the shows and\n\n363\n00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:32.239\nif I go on my system preferences and\nI go into Users and Groups,\n\n364\n00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:39.350\nI've got Don Pezet, no Wes Bryan,\nno Benjamin Franklin, none of those guys.\n\n365\n00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:41.800\nJust me and that's it, right?\n\n366\n00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:48.960\nAnd if I logout and I go to my login\nscreen when I go to login to this Mac,\n\n367\n00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:52.390\nit's going to ask me who I want to login\nas and it's going to show Don Pezet.\n\n368\n00:17:52.390 --> 00:17:54.120\nRight, because that's\nthe last person to login.\n\n369\n00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:56.140\nAnd if I hit this back arrow,\n\n370\n00:17:56.140 --> 00:17:59.288\nnow it's gonna show me the available\nusers to choose from and\n\n371\n00:17:59.288 --> 00:18:03.330\njust Don Pezet, that's it, right, and\nthat's the only person I can login as.\n\n372\n00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:04.578\nSo how can Wes login?\n\n373\n00:18:04.578 --> 00:18:07.245\nWell, the short answer is he can't.\n\n374\n00:18:07.245 --> 00:18:10.490\nHe can't because the client doesn't\nknow about the Open Directory.\n\n375\n00:18:10.490 --> 00:18:11.670\nSo we need to educate it.\n\n376\n00:18:11.670 --> 00:18:13.260\nWe need to tell it about\nthe Open Directory and\n\n377\n00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:15.230\nyou do that through what's called binding.\n\n378\n00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:18.970\nI need to bind this client\nwith the Open Directory.\n\n379\n00:18:18.970 --> 00:18:22.660\nAnd you can bind with Apple's Open\nDirectory or Microsoft's Active Directory.\n\n380\n00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:23.430\nYou can bind to either one.\n\n381\n00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:26.140\nThat's why I said at the beginning of the\nshow, you might not need Open Directory.\n\n382\n00:18:26.140 --> 00:18:28.290\nYou might already have\nMicrosoft's Active Directory.\n\n383\n00:18:28.290 --> 00:18:29.490\nYou can just use that.\n\n384\n00:18:29.490 --> 00:18:32.996\nAll right, the way we do the bind is\nyou go into System Preferences and\n\n385\n00:18:32.996 --> 00:18:36.216\nyou go to Users and Groups,\nright where I was just a moment ago.\n\n386\n00:18:37.841 --> 00:18:41.781\nBut your directory might have hundreds or\nthousands or tens of thousands of users,\n\n387\n00:18:41.781 --> 00:18:44.031\nso we don't want a big\nlist of users right here,\n\n388\n00:18:44.031 --> 00:18:47.030\nthat could make this screen\ntake forever to come up.\n\n389\n00:18:47.030 --> 00:18:50.540\nSo instead what you have are your\nlogging options right here.\n\n390\n00:18:50.540 --> 00:18:53.610\nAnd in your logging options,\nyou'll see this guy right here,\n\n391\n00:18:53.610 --> 00:18:58.330\nNetwork Account Server where I can choose\nto connect to Microsoft's Active Directory\n\n392\n00:18:58.330 --> 00:19:01.242\nor to an Apple Open Directory\nserver somewhere on my network.\n\n393\n00:19:01.242 --> 00:19:05.860\nI do need to unlock it,\njust let me do that.\n\n394\n00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:10.680\nAnd now, I can join my directory,\nand I'm going to choose to join it,\n\n395\n00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:12.470\nwhich is that binding\nthat I was talking about.\n\n396\n00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:15.260\nNow notice that you haven't\nseen the word bind anywhere?\n\n397\n00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:18.210\nOn the exam you will so\nmake sure you remember that word.\n\n398\n00:19:18.210 --> 00:19:23.310\nI need to point to a server and\nmy server was called osx/server01.local,\n\n399\n00:19:23.310 --> 00:19:26.600\nthat was the name of the server.\n\n400\n00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:28.610\nSo I'm gonna specify that.\n\n401\n00:19:28.610 --> 00:19:31.640\nYou'd specify whatever the name of\nyour server happened to be, and\n\n402\n00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:32.650\nthen we can try and connect.\n\n403\n00:19:32.650 --> 00:19:35.580\nNow if it fails we have the Open Directory\nutility, but hopefully we wont need that.\n\n404\n00:19:36.650 --> 00:19:37.360\nAnd there we go.\n\n405\n00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:39.490\nIt's telling me that server\nprovides SSL certificates,\n\n406\n00:19:39.490 --> 00:19:41.920\nbecause it has to encrypt\nall the communications.\n\n407\n00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:42.870\nDo I want to trust them?\n\n408\n00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:46.030\nAnd I'll go ahead and say yes to trust it.\n\n409\n00:19:46.030 --> 00:19:50.775\nAll right, and then it says we also have,\nlet's see, it does secure and unsecure, so\n\n410\n00:19:50.775 --> 00:19:52.790\nit's asking if I want to allow that.\n\n411\n00:19:52.790 --> 00:19:54.020\nI'll go ahead and continue on that.\n\n412\n00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:55.630\nWe haven't assigned any certificates.\n\n413\n00:19:55.630 --> 00:19:57.620\nAgain, if you go into the server episodes,\n\n414\n00:19:57.620 --> 00:20:00.700\nwe'll show how to attach certificates\nto all this stuff to encrypt it.\n\n415\n00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:05.020\nBut assuming we bind correctly,\nwhat you should see is this right here.\n\n416\n00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:08.200\nNetwork Account Server\nwith the green light and\n\n417\n00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:10.020\nthe name of the server you connected to.\n\n418\n00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:12.610\nI know I’m bound to that directory\nnow because I got a green light\n\n419\n00:20:12.610 --> 00:20:13.530\nand its working.\n\n420\n00:20:13.530 --> 00:20:14.880\nIf I had a red light,\nor something like that,\n\n421\n00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:16.780\nthat’ll let me know there’s a problem.\n\n422\n00:20:16.780 --> 00:20:17.290\nHere I’m connected.\n\n423\n00:20:18.340 --> 00:20:20.650\nAll right now notice that my\nUser Account list is still the same.\n\n424\n00:20:20.650 --> 00:20:23.480\nI don’t see Wes, but that’s okay.\n\n425\n00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:26.193\nBecause now when I login,\nI can login against the directory, so\n\n426\n00:20:26.193 --> 00:20:27.310\nI'm gonna go and logout.\n\n427\n00:20:28.650 --> 00:20:33.160\nAnd this time, when I logout,\nthe screen's actually gonna look the same,\n\n428\n00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:36.058\nexcept I've got a new little\nentry right here, Other.\n\n429\n00:20:36.058 --> 00:20:37.606\nAll right.\n\n430\n00:20:37.606 --> 00:20:40.900\nNow on some Macs, it does actually go\nright back into the user, you see this\n\n431\n00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:44.070\nscreen here, and you just have to\nremember to hit that back arrow, right?\n\n432\n00:20:44.070 --> 00:20:46.730\nHit the back arrow, and\nnow you've got Other.\n\n433\n00:20:46.730 --> 00:20:52.090\nAnd when you choose Other, what it's\nreally saying is use a Directory Server.\n\n434\n00:20:52.090 --> 00:20:58.620\nAnd so I'm gonna put in that\nI want to be Wes Bryan.\n\n435\n00:20:58.620 --> 00:21:00.430\nOkay, now Wes had two usernames.\n\n436\n00:21:00.430 --> 00:21:02.620\nHe had the full name, Wes Bryan, and\n\n437\n00:21:02.620 --> 00:21:05.550\nalso the username I gave him of WBryan,\nI can use either one.\n\n438\n00:21:07.130 --> 00:21:11.070\nAnd I'm gonna punch in his password and\nwe're gonna login.\n\n439\n00:21:11.070 --> 00:21:15.320\nIn the background, the Mac is reaching\nout to the Open Directory server and\n\n440\n00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:17.860\nsaying hey,\nsomebody just typed in Wes Bryan for\n\n441\n00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:22.380\na name and they typed in this password,\nis that okay, does that match?\n\n442\n00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:25.390\nAnd the Directory Server's\ngonna look at it and say yeah,\n\n443\n00:21:25.390 --> 00:21:26.900\nthat matches, let them in.\n\n444\n00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:29.780\nOr no that doesn't match,\ndon't let them in.\n\n445\n00:21:29.780 --> 00:21:31.915\nThe computer itself can't do the check,\n\n446\n00:21:31.915 --> 00:21:34.790\nbecause it doesn't have the Wes Bryan\naccount but the directory does.\n\n447\n00:21:34.790 --> 00:21:36.630\nAnd it doesn't actually send the password,\n\n448\n00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:38.960\ni don't want to go too crazy\non the specs on this stuff.\n\n449\n00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:41.970\nBut it sends a hash of the password and\nthe server hashes it too and\n\n450\n00:21:41.970 --> 00:21:43.190\nit's comparing hashes.\n\n451\n00:21:43.190 --> 00:21:46.030\nSo if somebody intercepts this traffic on\nthe network, they don't get your password.\n\n452\n00:21:46.030 --> 00:21:47.820\nThey just get a hash which is useless.\n\n453\n00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:51.020\n>> Don, from the client standpoint\non this, this binding of it to\n\n454\n00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:54.830\nthe Open Directory almost seems like\na trust relationship that it's forming.\n\n455\n00:21:54.830 --> 00:21:59.320\nIt's saying hey, if that username, if that\naccount is up on that server and you trust\n\n456\n00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:02.720\nhim when you login their credentials here,\nI'll go ahead and trust them as well.\n\n457\n00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:06.490\n>> That is a great description of it\nbecause that's exactly what's happening.\n\n458\n00:22:06.490 --> 00:22:08.920\nWe don't know all the user\naccounts on the directory server.\n\n459\n00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:11.855\nAnd there could be a brand new user\naccount that was created two minutes ago.\n\n460\n00:22:11.855 --> 00:22:15.160\nYour work station doesn't know about it\nbut when that person logs in the first\n\n461\n00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:18.560\ntime we'll trust it because it\nexists on the directory server.\n\n462\n00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:22.140\nSo now I'm logged in and\nI'm logged in as Wes.\n\n463\n00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:27.940\nAnd if he goes into System Preferences and\ngoes into Users and Groups.\n\n464\n00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:31.290\nWhen we jump in here, look what it did?\n\n465\n00:22:31.290 --> 00:22:33.790\nWes Bryan, Network account.\n\n466\n00:22:33.790 --> 00:22:34.290\nRight?\n\n467\n00:22:34.290 --> 00:22:37.268\nNot a local account like these guys\ndown here but a network account.\n\n468\n00:22:37.268 --> 00:22:40.404\nHe's coming from the directory but\nnow he's able to login and work and\n\n469\n00:22:40.404 --> 00:22:41.470\nuse this system.\n\n470\n00:22:41.470 --> 00:22:41.990\nRight?\n\n471\n00:22:41.990 --> 00:22:46.030\nThis works station is now bound\nto the Open Directory and\n\n472\n00:22:46.030 --> 00:22:48.120\npeople can login using\nthe Network account.\n\n473\n00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:52.670\nAnd if Wes were to change his password by\nusing Change Password button it's actually\n\n474\n00:22:52.670 --> 00:22:57.110\ngonna change it on the server,\nnot changing it here on the client.\n\n475\n00:22:57.110 --> 00:23:00.340\nAnd that way if he goes to any of\nthe other computers in the network,\n\n476\n00:23:00.340 --> 00:23:02.460\nhis new password already takes effect.\n\n477\n00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:06.760\nAnd as an administrator if I wanna kill\noff his account I can come right here\n\n478\n00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:11.330\nin to the Users list and I can disable\nhis account and cut his access off or\n\n479\n00:23:11.330 --> 00:23:14.180\nreset his password or\ndelete the user, right?\n\n480\n00:23:14.180 --> 00:23:17.580\nAnd once that happens,\nhe's now lost access to the network and\n\n481\n00:23:17.580 --> 00:23:18.940\nhe's not been able to get in.\n\n482\n00:23:18.940 --> 00:23:20.470\nSo we've got that functionality.\n\n483\n00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:22.540\nWe have centralized management or\nour User Accounts,\n\n484\n00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:25.170\nand that's kind of\nthe critical piece here.\n\n485\n00:23:25.170 --> 00:23:28.570\nThe other thing is,\nlet's say you've got a help desk.\n\n486\n00:23:28.570 --> 00:23:31.750\nAnd your help desk needs to be able to\nlogin to people's computers to help them.\n\n487\n00:23:31.750 --> 00:23:35.070\nWell, normally we have to create a help\ndesk account on everybody's machine.\n\n488\n00:23:35.070 --> 00:23:37.060\nHere I can have a help desk\naccount that's centralized,\n\n489\n00:23:37.060 --> 00:23:39.040\nthat they can then reach out and\nlogin to these systems.\n\n490\n00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:40.980\nSo, it makes administration\na lot easier and\n\n491\n00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:43.970\nthat also doubles back to the reason\nwhy I wanted to film this episode.\n\n492\n00:23:43.970 --> 00:23:46.690\nIn the next episode we're gonna\ndo the Profile Manager, and\n\n493\n00:23:46.690 --> 00:23:50.540\nthe Profile Manager is gonna push out\nconfiguration settings to the clients.\n\n494\n00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:53.020\nAnd it needs some kind of\ncredentials to do that.\n\n495\n00:23:53.020 --> 00:23:56.790\nAnd when we bind to a directory server\nlike this, it makes that possible,\n\n496\n00:23:56.790 --> 00:23:57.810\nmakes that easy.\n\n497\n00:23:57.810 --> 00:24:01.940\nYou actually can use the profile\nmanager without an Open Directory, but\n\n498\n00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:04.950\nit's not designed to work that way and\nit makes things a lot more difficult.\n\n499\n00:24:04.950 --> 00:24:09.020\nSo, Apple's official recommendation is,\nif you're gonna use Profile Manager,\n\n500\n00:24:09.020 --> 00:24:11.260\nyou really do need to have\nan Open Directory in place.\n\n501\n00:24:11.260 --> 00:24:12.360\n>> Very good.\nIn this episode,\n\n502\n00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:15.740\nwe've been looking at Open Directory and\nthe benefits of the centralized\n\n503\n00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:18.110\nadministration that it can give you and\nyour network.\n\n504\n00:24:18.110 --> 00:24:20.090\nDon, you have anything else for\nus in this episode?\n\n505\n00:24:20.090 --> 00:24:20.950\n>> That's about it on this one.\n\n506\n00:24:20.950 --> 00:24:22.310\nI know it's a little bit\nshorter of an episode but\n\n507\n00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:24.750\nstay tuned because we're gonna\nget into Profile Manager next and\n\n508\n00:24:24.750 --> 00:24:26.200\nthat's where we're gonna\nleverage all of this.\n\n509\n00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:26.720\n>> All right.\n\n510\n00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:29.070\nWell, we're gonna go ahead and\nsign off here at ITProTV.\n\n511\n00:24:29.070 --> 00:24:30.550\nI've been your host Wes Bryan.\n\n512\n00:24:30.550 --> 00:24:31.680\n>> And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n513\n00:24:31.680 -->

00:00:16.934\nI'm your host Wes Bryan, and\n\n4\n00:00:16.934 --> 00:00:21.491\nin today's episode we're gonna be diving\nin to the world of Mac and Mac management.\n\n5\n00:00:21.491 --> 00:00:25.440\nSo, here with Mac management basics\nto help us out is Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n6\n00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:26.740\nDon, how are you doing today, sir?\n\n7\n00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:27.764\n>> I'm doing great, Wes.\n\n8\n00:00:27.764 --> 00:00:31.110\nFired up, jump into another exciting\nepisode, because in this episode, we're\n\n9\n00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:35.330\ngonna take a look at the Profile Manager,\nwhich is a insanely powerful piece of\n\n10\n00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:39.040\nsoftware that is built into the Server\napp inside of Mac OS, so it's a fun one.\n\n11\n00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.530\nThere's a lot of a really cool stuff.\n\n12\n00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.010\nYou'll see, this is one of those\ntechnologies that you cover that, yeah,\n\n13\n00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.550\nit's kinda hard to get it turned on and\nset up.\n\n14\n00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.670\nBut once it's set up,\nthe world is your oyster.\n\n15\n00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:50.970\nThere are so\nmany options inside of this thing.\n\n16\n00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:54.490\nYou can do so much stuff with it, that\nit gets the gears moving in your head.\n\n17\n00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:56.320\nYou know like,\nwhat all can I do with this?\n\n18\n00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:57.710\nIt's pretty amazing stuff.\n\n19\n00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.860\nSo, if you've never heard of the Profile\nManager, I guess let me back up.\n\n20\n00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:04.100\nI'm hyping it up here and\nI haven't even told you what it is.\n\n21\n00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.370\nWhen we deploy a Mac,\nit's got a lot of settings on it.\n\n22\n00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:10.330\nSome of the settings are simple,\nlike what's your wallpaper.\n\n23\n00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.270\nSome are more complex,\nlike what apps do you have, or\n\n24\n00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.550\nwhat's your energy saving settings,\nand so on.\n\n25\n00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.180\nAll of those are configuration\nsettings that are stored in preference\n\n26\n00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:20.520\nfiles on your Mac.\n\n27\n00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.100\nAnd if I have one Mac, and I want to\nget it set up the way that I want,\n\n28\n00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:25.670\nI just sit down and I do it,\nand that's the end of it.\n\n29\n00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:26.880\nIt is that easy.\n\n30\n00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.120\nBut if I have a thousand Macs and\nI want them all set up\n\n31\n00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:34.110\nthe particular way that I want,\nit becomes a lot more difficult.\n\n32\n00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.080\nAnd we talked about this back in\nthe NetInstall episodes, right?\n\n33\n00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.460\nThat I said, if I'm about to deploy\na thousand Macs in my network and\n\n34\n00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.950\nI want them all set the same way, well,\nI can create an installation image.\n\n35\n00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.789\nI can make a NetInstall image or\n\n36\n00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:49.907\na NetRestore image that has everything\nset exactly the way I want it.\n\n37\n00:01:49.907 --> 00:01:53.660\nAnd then I can roll it out to all\nthousand computers, and I'm done, right?\n\n38\n00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.659\nWell, I'm done that day.\n\n39\n00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:58.572\nWhat about tomorrow or the next day?\n\n40\n00:01:58.572 --> 00:02:02.270\nWell, I'm not buying a thousand\nnew computers every single day.\n\n41\n00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.430\nBut, I turn them over to my end users,\nand the end users start doing, well,\n\n42\n00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:08.461\nthe stuff that end users do, right?\n\n43\n00:02:08.461 --> 00:02:11.862\nThey start changing that wallpaper and\ninstalling garbage apps, and doing all\n\n44\n00:02:11.862 --> 00:02:15.225\nthe crazy things that happens when you\nput a computer into somebody's hands.\n\n45\n00:02:15.225 --> 00:02:18.160\nAnd it starts to get away from\nthe way that we had it set up, right?\n\n46\n00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.400\nLet's use power savings as an example.\n\n47\n00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.170\nLet's say that my company is open\nfrom 9 AM to 5 PM every day.\n\n48\n00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.230\nAnd I know that a lot of people leave\ntheir computers on at the end of the day,\n\n49\n00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.170\nso when 5 PM rolls around and people\nleave their computer on, they go home.\n\n50\n00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.230\nAnd the computer's just sitting there,\n\n51\n00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:37.970\nrunning up my electric\nbill all night long.\n\n52\n00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:39.950\nSo I want the computer to go to sleep.\n\n53\n00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.710\nSo, I set it, so that every computer,\nif it sits there idle for\n\n54\n00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:47.620\n30 minutes, goes to sleep, and\nwe'll push those out into the field.\n\n55\n00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.490\nWell, then my end users get a hold of it,\nand throughout the day,\n\n56\n00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:53.050\nthey're like, I hate it when I come back\nfrom lunch and the computer's asleep.\n\n57\n00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:55.840\nI'm gonna turn that off,\nand they turn it off.\n\n58\n00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.140\nWell, it just ruined my perfect\nvision of energy savings.\n\n59\n00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.990\nRight?\nSo, I need a way to enforce those settings\n\n60\n00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:06.120\nafter the image is out, right?\n\n61\n00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.400\nAfter the computer's already\nin somebody's hands.\n\n62\n00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.300\nI've already got it set the way I want it.\n\n63\n00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:13.000\nHow do I keep it set the way that I want?\n\n64\n00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.440\nAnd the answer is, the Profile Manager.\n\n65\n00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.510\nThe Profile Manager lets you do that.\n\n66\n00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.300\nYou can build a collection of settings.\n\n67\n00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:25.030\nAnd not only can you push it out to\nthe clients, you can enforce it.\n\n68\n00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.620\nYou can force them to do things\na certain way, and they can't change it.\n\n69\n00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.960\nOr, if through some miraculous\nhappenstance they do manage to change it,\n\n70\n00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:34.270\nit just gets put right back,\n\n71\n00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:37.460\nthe next time the policy applies\nwhich is usually every 24 hours.\n\n72\n00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:39.930\nSo, it's gonna happen pretty quickly.\n\n73\n00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:41.790\nAnd now it gets put back\nto the way that it was.\n\n74\n00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.690\nSo, that's what the Profile Manager\nis designed for.\n\n75\n00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:45.820\nNow, some of this might sound familiar.\n\n76\n00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:48.610\nIf you're an old school Mac person,\nif you've been working with it for\n\n77\n00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:52.220\na while, you might remember something\ncalled a managed preference, right?\n\n78\n00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:54.080\nManaged preferences were the old system,\nand\n\n79\n00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:56.390\nProfile Manager replaced it\na couple of versions ago.\n\n80\n00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:58.540\nSo I doubt you'll see that on the exam,\nbut just in case some of\n\n81\n00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:01.630\nyou guys are going I thought this\nwas called Manage Preferences?\n\n82\n00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:02.810\nWell you're right,\nthat's what it used to be.\n\n83\n00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:05.370\nAnd what Manage Preferences was,\nit was a lot more manual.\n\n84\n00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:09.860\nWe're gonna see with the Profile Manager,\nwe can do this entirely over the network.\n\n85\n00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:12.540\nAnd not just our network,\nwe can do it all over the world.\n\n86\n00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.820\nYou can have people with Macs on networks\nthat you've never even heard of.\n\n87\n00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:18.050\nThey can be at a hotel somewhere.\n\n88\n00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:21.250\nAnd their system can connect\nup to your Profile Manager and\n\n89\n00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:23.930\nhave the settings apply to it,\njust the way that you want.\n\n90\n00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:27.448\nSo you can control machines\nin the building with you, and\n\n91\n00:04:27.448 --> 00:04:30.170\nyou can control them\neven after they leave.\n\n92\n00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:32.940\nAnd that's when we start\ngetting into what's called MDM.\n\n93\n00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:34.980\nMobile Device Management.\n\n94\n00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:37.290\nLet's say, you've got a company laptop.\n\n95\n00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:41.050\nAnd you're at airport and\nsomebody steals the laptop.\n\n96\n00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:42.770\nYou just loss control of it.\n\n97\n00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:45.560\nWhat about all your company\ndata that's on that laptop?\n\n98\n00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.600\nWell, with Profile Manager\nwe can remote wipe it.\n\n99\n00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.630\nWe can send a wipe command.\n\n100\n00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:52.910\nAnd the next time that laptop\ngets an Internet connection,\n\n101\n00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:54.690\nit will erase your data, right?\n\n102\n00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:58.090\nSo you can actually preserve and\nprotect your information by using this.\n\n103\n00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:59.590\nIt's really powerful stuff.\n\n104\n00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:00.380\nIt's a neat product.\n\n105\n00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:01.850\nIt's kinda why I get so excited.\n\n106\n00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:06.090\nI get fired up about this because I\nknow there's so much power in this.\n\n107\n00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:07.984\nBut just getting it turned on\nis a little bit rough, and so\n\n108\n00:05:07.984 --> 00:05:09.968\nwe're gonna walk through that\nright here in this episode.\n\n109\n00:05:09.968 --> 00:05:12.261\nHow do we get it turned on,\nget it put in place, and\n\n110\n00:05:12.261 --> 00:05:14.570\nthen we'll start pushing\nsome settings with it.\n\n111\n00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:19.100\n>> Don, you showed us in\nthe caching software the notes.\n\n112\n00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:21.140\nYou guys sometimes don't see\nthe notes beforehand, and\n\n113\n00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:26.320\nDon had almost no, barely anything for\nnotes on the caching server.\n\n114\n00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:28.885\nThis one here,\nI've got five pages of notes.\n\n115\n00:05:28.885 --> 00:05:31.880\n[LAUGH] So guys,\ngood information coming up.\n\n116\n00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:34.530\nDon, there are some\nprerequisites that we need.\n\n117\n00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:36.960\nRight?\nSome things that are required in order to\n\n118\n00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:38.586\nset this profile manager up?\n\n119\n00:05:38.586 --> 00:05:40.640\n>> Yeah, you know, Profile Manager,\nit wasn't always around.\n\n120\n00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:41.940\nWe used to have those managed preferences.\n\n121\n00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:44.845\nAnd so,\nit was really introduced in OS 10.7.\n\n122\n00:05:44.845 --> 00:05:47.344\nSo you have to really be running 10.7 and\nhigher.\n\n123\n00:05:47.344 --> 00:05:51.394\nAnd some of the options that we're gonna\nsee as we set it up were introduced in\n\n124\n00:05:51.394 --> 00:05:53.820\n10.9, just back in Mavericks.\n\n125\n00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:57.961\nSo, if you're running the newer Mac OSs,\nif you're running Mavericks and higher,\n\n126\n00:05:57.961 --> 00:06:00.220\n100% of what you see here works just fine.\n\n127\n00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:03.788\nBut if you're running\nsome of the older OSs,\n\n128\n00:06:03.788 --> 00:06:07.463\nif you're running any of the Snow Leopards\nor cat ones, any of those,\n\n129\n00:06:07.463 --> 00:06:10.164\nwell some of the features work,\nsome don't work.\n\n130\n00:06:10.164 --> 00:06:12.000\nPrior to 10.7,\nnone of the features worked.\n\n131\n00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.608\nSo you really do need to have newer ones,\nand\n\n132\n00:06:13.608 --> 00:06:15.990\nApple's starting to be a little\nmore strict about that.\n\n133\n00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:19.945\nThey're not going back and supporting\nOSs back to the beginning of time.\n\n134\n00:06:19.945 --> 00:06:21.550\nThey're kinda keeping it\nwith their newer ones.\n\n135\n00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:25.280\nYou gotta stay up to date, which is why\nwe're filming these El Capitan episodes\n\n136\n00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:28.050\nright now,\nbecause we've got to stay up to date.\n\n137\n00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:30.690\nAll right, so\nthat's one set of requirements we've got.\n\n138\n00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:33.250\nThe other thing is you are gonna\nneed a server somewhere.\n\n139\n00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:36.360\nWhich is really just a Mac OS machine\nthat has the Server app installed.\n\n140\n00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:38.020\nThat's kind of the critical thing.\n\n141\n00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:41.760\nYou're also going to need an Apple ID,\nright?\n\n142\n00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:44.610\nYou've gotta have an Apple ID, because\nthis one has to register with Apple.\n\n143\n00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:46.960\nRemember how I said it works\nanywhere in the world?\n\n144\n00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:48.790\nWell, that means we\ngotta check in somehow.\n\n145\n00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:50.650\nAnd we check in through Apple's server.\n\n146\n00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:52.570\nSo you gotta have an Apple ID too,\nall right?\n\n147\n00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:54.280\nNow when we get this set up,\n\n148\n00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:56.770\nthe Profile Manager's actually\nmade up of three different pieces.\n\n149\n00:06:56.770 --> 00:07:01.250\nThere's the three chunks that we largely\ndon't have to deal with specifically.\n\n150\n00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:04.920\nThe key thing is, there's a web\npage that we use to administer it.\n\n151\n00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:08.380\nThat's different than all of the other\nservers that we set up in the Server app.\n\n152\n00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:11.010\nAll the other stuff we manage right\nfrom inside of the Server app.\n\n153\n00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:13.790\nWith the Profile Manager we turn\nit on in the Server app, but\n\n154\n00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:17.060\nthen we have a web portal we\nactually go to to administer it.\n\n155\n00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:21.040\nThere's a separate web portal for your end\nusers, so that end users can login and\n\n156\n00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:22.240\nmanage their own device.\n\n157\n00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:26.100\nIf an end user loses a phone, they could\nactually go to the Profile Manager\n\n158\n00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:30.370\nwebsite, login and erase their own phone\nwithout getting us involved, right?\n\n159\n00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:32.100\nThey wanna get the admins\ninvolved eventually,\n\n160\n00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:35.370\nbut they can actually take\ncertain actions on their own.\n\n161\n00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:38.907\nAnd then the other part is the MDM piece,\nthe Mobile Device Management.\n\n162\n00:07:38.907 --> 00:07:43.722\nAnd that's where we basically have these\nlittle agents that are running on our iOS\n\n163\n00:07:43.722 --> 00:07:46.883\nor Mac OS systems that allow\nus to do that remote wipe.\n\n164\n00:07:46.883 --> 00:07:49.650\nAnd that's already built into the systems,\nwe don't have to sweat that too much.\n\n165\n00:07:50.890 --> 00:07:54.541\nAll right, so after that what we're gonna\nneed to do, what we're gonna see here in\n\n166\n00:07:54.541 --> 00:07:57.318\nthis episode is we're gonna\ncreate a Profile Manager server.\n\n167\n00:07:57.318 --> 00:07:59.557\nAnd then we need to get our\nclients connected to it, and\n\n168\n00:07:59.557 --> 00:08:01.368\nthat can be a little bit tricky,\nall right.\n\n169\n00:08:01.368 --> 00:08:05.272\nThere's three different ways we can get\na client connected to our profile manager.\n\n170\n00:08:05.272 --> 00:08:07.720\nThey've gotta be connected or\nthey don't know to look for it.\n\n171\n00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:09.700\nYou wouldn’t want your Mac to turn on and\n\n172\n00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:12.940\nconnect to somebody else’s profile\nmanager, cuz then they'd have control.\n\n173\n00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:14.362\nSo we've gotta create an agreement.\n\n174\n00:08:14.362 --> 00:08:17.800\nAnd the agreement is kinda tricky\nbecause it is all built around as\n\n175\n00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:19.437\na cells certificate, right?\n\n176\n00:08:19.437 --> 00:08:22.803\nWe have to have certificates to\nauthenticate our systems and\n\n177\n00:08:22.803 --> 00:08:27.926\nto encrypt and secure the data, and there\nhas to be a trust for that to happen.\n\n178\n00:08:27.926 --> 00:08:31.030\nNow, if you've got an open\ndirectory deployed,\n\n179\n00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:33.410\nthen your profile manager is\npart of that open directory.\n\n180\n00:08:33.410 --> 00:08:36.900\nYour clients are part of that open\ndirectory and the trust already exists.\n\n181\n00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:39.450\nYou already trust the certificates that\nare gonna be issued as part of your\n\n182\n00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:40.770\nprofile manager.\n\n183\n00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:42.610\nBut if you don't have an open directory,\n\n184\n00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:45.750\nthen your clients don't\ntrust the profile manager.\n\n185\n00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:47.300\nThat trust doesn't exist.\n\n186\n00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:51.135\nAnd so, what we have to do is we have to\ngenerate a little package in our profile\n\n187\n00:08:51.135 --> 00:08:52.070\nmanager.\n\n188\n00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:53.910\nThat contains our root certificate.\n\n189\n00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:56.710\nNot the private key, but\nthe public key for our root certificate.\n\n190\n00:08:56.710 --> 00:09:00.480\nSo that we can give that out to\nour clients and they can trust it.\n\n191\n00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:03.162\nAnd you can do it a few ways,\nprobably the easiest way is email.\n\n192\n00:09:03.162 --> 00:09:05.740\nYou can actually email that package,\nsomebody gets the email,\n\n193\n00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:08.980\nthey run it, and now they trust and\nknow about your profile manager.\n\n194\n00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:11.360\nAnd from then on, they'll start getting\ntheir settings from the profile manager.\n\n195\n00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:12.370\nSo emailing is one way.\n\n196\n00:09:12.370 --> 00:09:14.660\nYou can do user download.\n\n197\n00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:17.370\nSomebody can browse to\na particular webpage and\n\n198\n00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:19.380\ndownload that little package,\nit's gonna make them trust it.\n\n199\n00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:22.840\nAnd the package,\nit really is just the route certificate.\n\n200\n00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:25.850\nAnd then the third way is through MDM,\nthrough the Mobile Device Management,\n\n201\n00:09:25.850 --> 00:09:29.060\nwe can actually push it that way\ntoo if we've got MDM deployed.\n\n202\n00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:33.880\nSo there's a few ways, but email and user\ndownload are probably the two most common.\n\n203\n00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:36.100\nA pretty straight forward\nway to push them out.\n\n204\n00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:41.760\nNow, when you get a new computer, you\nneed to enroll it in the profile manager.\n\n205\n00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:43.120\nThe first time is manually.\n\n206\n00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:45.580\nYou've got to do it by hand,\nyou've got to get that attachment.\n\n207\n00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:48.772\nAfter that, from now on it will always\ncheck in with the profile manager and\n\n208\n00:09:48.772 --> 00:09:52.440\neverything else we can do hands-off,\nright from that central management panel.\n\n209\n00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:53.959\nSo it becomes a heck of\na lot easier down the road.\n\n210\n00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:57.070\nAll right.\nSo I think that's about it as far as\n\n211\n00:09:57.070 --> 00:09:57.595\nthe general stuff.\n\n212\n00:09:57.595 --> 00:10:00.720\nBut one thing I do wanna comment on,\nI know commented on the last episode,\n\n213\n00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:05.280\nis that while the clients don't have\nto be bound to the open directory,\n\n214\n00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:07.450\nyou do have to have an open directory.\n\n215\n00:10:07.450 --> 00:10:10.540\nAnd if you don't have one,\nwhen you install a profile manager,\n\n216\n00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:11.800\nit will create one for you.\n\n217\n00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:12.860\nIt'll launch that wizard.\n\n218\n00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:16.740\nSo that's why we filmed the last episode\nwhere we covered open directory.\n\n219\n00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:18.390\nIt's not in the exam objectives,\nbut it's good for\n\n220\n00:10:18.390 --> 00:10:20.540\nyou to know because you'll see\nit here with profile manager.\n\n221\n00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:24.330\nSo if you haven't watched it,\nwatch that last episode on open directory\n\n222\n00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:26.620\nbecause I've already got it\nturned on in my machine so\n\n223\n00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:28.810\nthat profile manager\nwill be able to use that.\n\n224\n00:10:28.810 --> 00:10:30.920\nAll right.\nSo, once we got that ready,\n\n225\n00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:33.380\nwe're ready to jump in and\nturn this thing on.\n\n226\n00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:37.320\nNow, to do that,\nI'm gonna jump into my server app and, so\n\n227\n00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:40.000\nhere I am in the server app for\nmy system and you can see, it's just up.\n\n228\n00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.621\nI've got my system called\nOSX-SERVER01.local and\n\n229\n00:10:43.621 --> 00:10:45.630\nit's running the server app.\n\n230\n00:10:45.630 --> 00:10:49.781\nI installed the open directory in our last\nepisode, so I've got that running here,\n\n231\n00:10:49.781 --> 00:10:50.959\nOSX-SERVER.local.\n\n232\n00:10:50.959 --> 00:10:52.660\nWe really didn't do\nanything special there.\n\n233\n00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:55.350\nWe just completed the wizard and\nthat was it.\n\n234\n00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:57.230\nSo, there's not anything too crazy.\n\n235\n00:10:57.230 --> 00:10:59.666\nAnd again,\nif you don't have an open directory,\n\n236\n00:10:59.666 --> 00:11:01.875\nthe profile manager will create one for\nyou.\n\n237\n00:11:01.875 --> 00:11:04.923\nNow, I need the profile manager,\nand if I look under my services,\n\n238\n00:11:04.923 --> 00:11:07.280\nyou'll see profile manager right there.\n\n239\n00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:08.960\nAnd I can choose it.\n\n240\n00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:10.750\nAnd the first thing we'll\nnotice is there's actually\n\n241\n00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:12.730\nquite a few different settings here,\nright?\n\n242\n00:11:12.730 --> 00:11:14.960\nI've got permissions,\nwhich we've seen on every service.\n\n243\n00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:17.990\nYou can control who's\nallowed to access the system.\n\n244\n00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:19.900\nThen, device management.\n\n245\n00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:21.643\nThere's that MDM piece, right?\n\n246\n00:11:21.643 --> 00:11:23.910\nDo I have device management turned on?\n\n247\n00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:25.040\nAnd I can turn that on if I want.\n\n248\n00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:29.570\nIt's disabled by default and there's\ntwo special programs that are optional.\n\n249\n00:11:29.570 --> 00:11:31.080\nWe're going to want device management.\n\n250\n00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:32.025\nWe'll want that.\n\n251\n00:11:32.025 --> 00:11:34.368\nBut these other two programs are optional.\n\n252\n00:11:34.368 --> 00:11:36.520\nNow, what are they?\n\n253\n00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:39.950\nNow, I mentioned that the first\ntime I get a new client,\n\n254\n00:11:39.950 --> 00:11:41.680\nI need to enroll it with\nmy profile manager.\n\n255\n00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:44.430\nI need to get that set up, and\nI have to do it by hand, right?\n\n256\n00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:47.360\nSo the first time I bring up a new\ncomputer, I've got to enroll it.\n\n257\n00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:49.860\nWhat if I'm buying tens of thousands or\n\n258\n00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:52.210\nhundreds of thousands of\ncomputers from Apple?\n\n259\n00:11:52.210 --> 00:11:53.890\nWell first off,\nyou're making them very happy.\n\n260\n00:11:53.890 --> 00:11:56.180\nSo they want you to buy that equipment.\n\n261\n00:11:56.180 --> 00:11:57.260\nAnd so secondly,\n\n262\n00:11:57.260 --> 00:12:00.560\nin order to keep you happy, they're\ngonna help you with that enrollment.\n\n263\n00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:01.810\nSo Apple has two programs.\n\n264\n00:12:01.810 --> 00:12:04.253\nThey have\nthe Device Enrollment Program and\n\n265\n00:12:04.253 --> 00:12:08.688\nthey have the Volume Purchase Program,\nand you could be in either one of these.\n\n266\n00:12:08.688 --> 00:12:13.125\nWhen you're a part of that program, what\nwill happen is anytime you buy a Mac from\n\n267\n00:12:13.125 --> 00:12:17.302\nApple, they'll send you a file ahead\nof time that has the serial numbers for\n\n268\n00:12:17.302 --> 00:12:20.656\nall of those devices and\ninformation for all those devices.\n\n269\n00:12:20.656 --> 00:12:24.500\nSo you can preload it here\ninto the profile manager.\n\n270\n00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:27.350\nAnd so that way on day one,\nwhen that new Mac shows up.\n\n271\n00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:30.410\nIt's already provisioned,\nit's already ready to go,\n\n272\n00:12:30.410 --> 00:12:32.840\nwe don't have to do it by hand, right?\n\n273\n00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:34.100\nNow these two programs are very similar.\n\n274\n00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:36.070\nThe bottom one,\nthe Volume Purchase Program, that's for\n\n275\n00:12:36.070 --> 00:12:37.990\npeople who buy a lot of equipment.\n\n276\n00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:41.820\nSo if your buying tens of thousands of\ncomputers, Apple will get you set up.\n\n277\n00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:45.030\nThey will take care of you because,\ncuz you gave them a lot of money, right?\n\n278\n00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:47.870\nSo they'll do that,\nthat's the Volume Purchase Program.\n\n279\n00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:50.170\nBut let's say you're\na company like ITProTV.\n\n280\n00:12:50.170 --> 00:12:52.890\nWe're small, we don't have\na ton of employees, we've got,\n\n281\n00:12:52.890 --> 00:12:57.140\nwe do kinda have a lot of Macs around\nhere but not that many, 20 or 25 Macs.\n\n282\n00:12:57.140 --> 00:12:59.990\nSo if I call Apple and I say,\nhey, I've got 20 Macs,\n\n283\n00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:02.250\ncan I get in your Volume Purchase Program?\n\n284\n00:13:02.250 --> 00:13:03.720\nThey're probably gonna laugh at me.\n\n285\n00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:05.780\nThey might not laugh on the phone but\nas soon as they hang up,\n\n286\n00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:08.250\nthey're laughing,\ncuz it's such a small, small number.\n\n287\n00:13:08.250 --> 00:13:10.030\nSo I can't participate in\nthe Volume Purchase Program.\n\n288\n00:13:11.045 --> 00:13:14.440\nBut if I say, okay, I've got 20 Macs,\nand I know that's not a lot but\n\n289\n00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:17.780\nI'm willing pay you,\nall of the it sudden changes, right?\n\n290\n00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:20.082\nYou can join\nthe Device Enrollment Program.\n\n291\n00:13:20.082 --> 00:13:24.250\nDevice Enrollment Program is, hey, I'm not\ngonna buy tens of thousands of Macs, but\n\n292\n00:13:24.250 --> 00:13:26.206\nI still want to auto provision, right?\n\n293\n00:13:26.206 --> 00:13:28.785\nAnd so, I pay for it,\nto join that device enrollment program.\n\n294\n00:13:28.785 --> 00:13:33.400\nAnd now when I buy one or two Macs,\nwhich is more like what we do.\n\n295\n00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:36.890\nThen, they can send me that information,\nit's pre-provision, it's ready to rock.\n\n296\n00:13:36.890 --> 00:13:39.210\nSo the two programs kind\nof work in the same way.\n\n297\n00:13:39.210 --> 00:13:41.530\nThe difference is the volume\npurchase side, you kinda get it for\n\n298\n00:13:41.530 --> 00:13:43.280\nfree cuz you're buying a ton of junk.\n\n299\n00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:45.450\nI mean,\n[LAUGH] gotta stop saying stuff like that.\n\n300\n00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:47.265\nYou're buying a ton of computers, right?\n\n301\n00:13:47.265 --> 00:13:51.490\n[LAUGH] But\nthe device enrollment program is not free.\n\n302\n00:13:51.490 --> 00:13:53.730\nWe gotta get enrolled in that and\nwe pay for that, so\n\n303\n00:13:53.730 --> 00:13:55.230\nyou've got those options right there.\n\n304\n00:13:55.230 --> 00:13:57.620\nThey're both turned off for\nme cuz I'm not in either program.\n\n305\n00:13:57.620 --> 00:13:59.510\nWe just don't have enough to need it.\n\n306\n00:13:59.510 --> 00:14:00.230\nAll right.\n\n307\n00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:01.880\nSome of the other things you'll see.\n\n308\n00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:03.970\nThe default configuration profile.\n\n309\n00:14:03.970 --> 00:14:08.550\nSo the profile manager let's you\ncreate different, well, profiles.\n\n310\n00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:10.430\nDifferent collections of settings.\n\n311\n00:14:10.430 --> 00:14:14.220\nAnd I might have accounting computers\nthat need one group of settings.\n\n312\n00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:16.780\nAnd I might have sales computers that\nneed a different group of settings.\n\n313\n00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:19.970\nOr I might have teachers and\nstudents with very different settings.\n\n314\n00:14:19.970 --> 00:14:22.640\nRight?\nThose are all profiles that I create.\n\n315\n00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:24.770\nBut you can have a default profile,\n\n316\n00:14:24.770 --> 00:14:27.960\none that applies to everybody in\nthe event that no other profile applies.\n\n317\n00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:29.270\nAnd these are the settings for everyone.\n\n318\n00:14:29.270 --> 00:14:33.350\nSo I can jump into those settings right\nhere and start to work with them, right?\n\n319\n00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:35.460\nSign configuration profiles.\n\n320\n00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:38.000\nThis is for digitally signing any profile.\n\n321\n00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.330\nNow, a profile can contain\nall sorts of stuff.\n\n322\n00:14:40.330 --> 00:14:42.890\nLike you can create an administrator\naccount on your system.\n\n323\n00:14:42.890 --> 00:14:44.679\nSo, imagine if you're a malicious person.\n\n324\n00:14:44.679 --> 00:14:49.804\nAnd you create a profile that creates\nan admin account for you, right?\n\n325\n00:14:49.804 --> 00:14:52.888\nYou could just go to somebody's computer\nand run it, and install it, couldn't you?\n\n326\n00:14:52.888 --> 00:14:53.905\nYou could.\n\n327\n00:14:53.905 --> 00:14:55.975\nHow do we know if it's valid or not?\n\n328\n00:14:55.975 --> 00:14:59.145\nWell, to install a profile you have to be\nthe administrator, so that it already have\n\n329\n00:14:59.145 --> 00:15:02.675\nto had administrative accounts since\nthat kind of eliminates that attack.\n\n330\n00:15:02.675 --> 00:15:05.765\nBut the other thing is we can\ndigitally sign it with a certificate.\n\n331\n00:15:05.765 --> 00:15:08.295\nAnd that way, if somebody took it and\ntry to modify it,\n\n332\n00:15:08.295 --> 00:15:11.565\nthe signature would be invalid and\nthe profile wouldn't work anymore, right?\n\n333\n00:15:11.565 --> 00:15:16.305\nSo we've that protection because\nof how that file was applied.\n\n334\n00:15:16.305 --> 00:15:18.452\nAll right, it's not on by default,\nbut we can turn that on.\n\n335\n00:15:18.452 --> 00:15:21.927\n>> Don, and to jump in here, would that\nbe something that you would need to,\n\n336\n00:15:21.927 --> 00:15:23.735\nlike say, if you were doing iPhones.\n\n337\n00:15:23.735 --> 00:15:26.863\nWould you have to pre-provision\nthe certification or certificate,\n\n338\n00:15:26.863 --> 00:15:29.998\nif I could say it, to be trusted like\nyou have to do on other platforms?\n\n339\n00:15:29.998 --> 00:15:31.290\n>> Absolutely you would, yep.\n\n340\n00:15:31.290 --> 00:15:33.638\nAnd we're gonna see,\nonce I get this turned on,\n\n341\n00:15:33.638 --> 00:15:36.800\nthat we're gonna generate\na certificate from Apple.\n\n342\n00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:38.194\nSo that way, when the phones check in,\n\n343\n00:15:38.194 --> 00:15:40.830\nthey're actually seeing the cert come\nfrom Apple, but it's tied to us.\n\n344\n00:15:40.830 --> 00:15:44.776\nSo we'll get a chance to see that\nas we go on and get this turned on.\n\n345\n00:15:44.776 --> 00:15:47.932\nBut by default,\nthose devices aren't gonna trust us, and\n\n346\n00:15:47.932 --> 00:15:50.218\nthey've gotta have that cert to trust it.\n\n347\n00:15:50.218 --> 00:15:53.302\nThe last two buttons down here\nat the bottom are actually just\n\n348\n00:15:53.302 --> 00:15:55.320\nshortcuts to a webpage.\n\n349\n00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:56.570\nMy Devices and Profile Manager.\n\n350\n00:15:56.570 --> 00:15:58.968\nThey both say open in Safari, right?\n\n351\n00:15:58.968 --> 00:16:03.470\nMy Devices,\nthat's the end-user's webpage they go to.\n\n352\n00:16:03.470 --> 00:16:05.330\nThey can see their devices\nthat are connect to them.\n\n353\n00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:06.980\nThey can remote, wipe, and so on, right?\n\n354\n00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:08.620\nThat's the end-user interface.\n\n355\n00:16:08.620 --> 00:16:11.200\nAnd Profile Manager,\nthat's the administrator interface.\n\n356\n00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:12.890\nThat's the one we're gonna use, right?\n\n357\n00:16:12.890 --> 00:16:15.060\nAnd these are just links to pop\nthem open in a web browser.\n\n358\n00:16:15.060 --> 00:16:17.930\nRemember I said, this is different than\nall the other services because we have\n\n359\n00:16:17.930 --> 00:16:20.170\na web portal that we use to manage it,\nso those are the links there.\n\n360\n00:16:20.170 --> 00:16:23.080\nIt's grayed out cuz mine's not turned on.\n\n361\n00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:24.580\nSo those are the basic settings here.\n\n362\n00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:27.450\nThere's not a whole heck of a lot for\nme to modify.\n\n363\n00:16:27.450 --> 00:16:31.530\nI really just need to turn it on, and\nthat's kind of our first step here.\n\n364\n00:16:31.530 --> 00:16:33.910\nIf I wanna get this set up,\nI need to turn it on.\n\n365\n00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:35.028\nSo we'll turn it on.\n\n366\n00:16:35.028 --> 00:16:36.530\nNow it's gonna start, and\n\n367\n00:16:36.530 --> 00:16:39.470\nit can take a moment while it gets started\nbecause its actually doing a lot, right?\n\n368\n00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:40.775\nIt's gotta set up a web server.\n\n369\n00:16:40.775 --> 00:16:42.252\nIt's gotta set up the ports for that.\n\n370\n00:16:42.252 --> 00:16:43.440\nIt's gotta enable it.\n\n371\n00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:45.580\nAnd so unlike some other services\nwhere you turn them on and\n\n372\n00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:49.130\nthey're done, I started this one and\nit took it a moment.\n\n373\n00:16:49.130 --> 00:16:53.240\nAnd then as soon as it's done,\nit tells me that it's available, and\n\n374\n00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:57.780\nI can get to it by browsing to\nmy servername/profilemanager.\n\n375\n00:16:57.780 --> 00:17:00.970\nWhich coincidentally is what\nthis button now points to.\n\n376\n00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:03.118\nSo now I can launch.\n\n377\n00:17:03.118 --> 00:17:05.888\nThese buttons light up because I'm\nnow running the profile manager.\n\n378\n00:17:05.888 --> 00:17:08.720\nSo where were up and we're good.\n\n379\n00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:12.160\nNow I do need to do one\nmore thing Wes mentioned.\n\n380\n00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:13.730\nWhat about those mobile devices?\n\n381\n00:17:13.730 --> 00:17:16.310\nWhat about an iPhone or an iPad?\n\n382\n00:17:16.310 --> 00:17:17.900\nThey're not gonna trust me.\n\n383\n00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:20.890\nAnd those devices are locked down, right?\n\n384\n00:17:20.890 --> 00:17:21.980\nThey call it a jail.\n\n385\n00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:23.340\nThey're put in a walled garden.\n\n386\n00:17:23.340 --> 00:17:26.550\nI can't just go ejecting\ncertificates into them, can I?\n\n387\n00:17:26.550 --> 00:17:27.840\nWell, no, you can't.\n\n388\n00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:29.180\nBut Apple can.\n\n389\n00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:31.510\nSo if I need to do device management for\nthose guys,\n\n390\n00:17:31.510 --> 00:17:32.920\nI'm gonna need to turn that on.\n\n391\n00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:36.130\nSo I'm gonna hit the configure button,\nall right.\n\n392\n00:17:36.130 --> 00:17:39.670\nAnd it's gonna launch a little wizard, and\nthis is configuring Device Management.\n\n393\n00:17:39.670 --> 00:17:43.230\nAnd what it's gonna do is it's\ngonna reach out to Apple, and\n\n394\n00:17:43.230 --> 00:17:48.230\nit's going to create a certificate\noff of Apple servers.\n\n395\n00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:50.440\nWell guess who iPhones trust?\n\n396\n00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:51.830\nGuess who iPads trust?\n\n397\n00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:53.230\nThey trust Apple servers.\n\n398\n00:17:53.230 --> 00:17:56.590\nAnd if Apple gives me a certificate\nto use, the iPhones and\n\n399\n00:17:56.590 --> 00:17:59.330\nthe iPads already trust it and\nnow I'll be able to manage those.\n\n400\n00:17:59.330 --> 00:18:00.630\nAll right, not to mention desktops, too.\n\n401\n00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:04.010\nAll right, so when I start to move\nforward on this, it's gonna ask me for\n\n402\n00:18:04.010 --> 00:18:06.640\nan organization name,\nmy email address, phone number, right?\n\n403\n00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:12.670\nSo I start to punch in the various data\nthat identifies the company and us.\n\n404\n00:18:12.670 --> 00:18:14.840\nAnd you wanna be accurate on this stuff.\n\n405\n00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:17.710\nApple's not going to fact check you\non this they don't really care, but\n\n406\n00:18:17.710 --> 00:18:18.420\nyour end users do.\n\n407\n00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:20.620\nIf an end user see's\na certificate pop up and\n\n408\n00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:24.530\nit doesn't match your actual data,\nwhat are they going to do?\n\n409\n00:18:24.530 --> 00:18:27.790\nThey're going to assume that\nthe certificate is not a valid one, right.\n\n410\n00:18:27.790 --> 00:18:28.985\nWoops that's not what I wanted [LAUGH].\n\n411\n00:18:28.985 --> 00:18:34.262\nSorry, I was trying to get to\nthe next line of the, why is it?\n\n412\n00:18:34.262 --> 00:18:36.580\nAll right, apparently it's going crazy.\n\n413\n00:18:36.580 --> 00:18:39.500\nSo, normally, you would go ahead and type\nin the city and state and all that stuff,\n\n414\n00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:41.240\nwhich for\nsome reason is not letting me do.\n\n415\n00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:44.180\nSo, you punch in all this information so\nthat when your end users see it,\n\n416\n00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:47.740\nthey know, yeah, yeah, the showing\nas ITProTV and yeah, that's Don,\n\n417\n00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:51.620\nand that's the company phone number so,\nit's all valid data.\n\n418\n00:18:51.620 --> 00:18:53.020\nSomebody could spoof this information.\n\n419\n00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:54.330\nThat's definitely possible,\n\n420\n00:18:54.330 --> 00:18:57.189\nbut, this helps a little bit at\nleast as far as identifying that.\n\n421\n00:18:58.560 --> 00:18:59.560\nAll right, now as I move forward,\n\n422\n00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:02.470\nhere's the certificate that\nit's trying to generate.\n\n423\n00:19:02.470 --> 00:19:05.600\nAnd you'll see it's generating\nthis OSX-SERVER01.local,\n\n424\n00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:10.970\ncuz that's my server, and\nit's doing it as an intermediate CA, okay?\n\n425\n00:19:10.970 --> 00:19:12.198\nAn intermediate CA,\n\n426\n00:19:12.198 --> 00:19:17.250\nand that's because technically Apple is\nthe true CA and we're an intermediate.\n\n427\n00:19:17.250 --> 00:19:19.670\nBut see how I was saying this\ncertificate isn't signed by a trusted\n\n428\n00:19:19.670 --> 00:19:20.860\ncertificate authority?\n\n429\n00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:23.930\nThat's because we're generating it,\nit's not like a true public one.\n\n430\n00:19:23.930 --> 00:19:27.870\nIf you jump over to our server episodes,\nlike the ACTC episodes, I show you guys\n\n431\n00:19:27.870 --> 00:19:30.800\nhow to setup a true certificate authority\nand link to an external one and\n\n432\n00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:33.010\nall that stuff, so\nwe can get a little bit more advanced.\n\n433\n00:19:33.010 --> 00:19:35.880\nBut for this, what we need,\nit's okay that it's being self signed.\n\n434\n00:19:37.394 --> 00:19:41.763\nAll right, now, in order for the push\nnotifications to work, in order for us to\n\n435\n00:19:41.763 --> 00:19:46.375\nsend signals out to those mobile devices,\nwe've gotta be registered with Apple.\n\n436\n00:19:46.375 --> 00:19:49.840\nAnd, so here's the part where\nwe're gonna sign up with Apple\n\n437\n00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:52.470\nto have that certificate\nstored up with them.\n\n438\n00:19:52.470 --> 00:19:55.540\nIt's gonna take my self-signed\ncertificate, and basically push that,\n\n439\n00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:58.750\nand that's associated with my Apple\ncertificate to allow the pushes.\n\n440\n00:19:58.750 --> 00:20:02.180\nBut I do need a valid Apple ID for\nthat, so\n\n441\n00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:06.920\nI'll punch in an Apple ID and a password.\n\n442\n00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:10.500\nAnd I thought that was my password,\nbut that looks incredibly long.\n\n443\n00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:13.460\nMaybe I'm an over achiever and\nI use a long password this time,\n\n444\n00:20:13.460 --> 00:20:14.880\nwe'll see if that works [LAUGH].\n\n445\n00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:17.740\nIf you don't have an Apple ID you\ncan create one right here, but\n\n446\n00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:19.890\nyou are gonna have to have\nan Apple ID to do this.\n\n447\n00:20:19.890 --> 00:20:20.640\nWe'll see if that works.\n\n448\n00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:21.610\nI think my password might be wrong.\n\n449\n00:20:21.610 --> 00:20:25.280\nAnd down here, see how it says,\nacquiring push certificate?\n\n450\n00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:30.250\nIt's reaching out to Apple, and it's\nhaving Apple issue a certificate that is\n\n451\n00:20:30.250 --> 00:20:34.723\nsigned and trusted by all those mobile\ndevices, this is a critical part.\n\n452\n00:20:34.723 --> 00:20:37.650\nAll right,\nwell I got error getting push certificate.\n\n453\n00:20:37.650 --> 00:20:39.690\nNow in my case,\nI'm sure it's the wrong password.\n\n454\n00:20:39.690 --> 00:20:41.250\nBut there's a number of things\nthat can generate that error,\n\n455\n00:20:41.250 --> 00:20:42.510\nand it's not very detailed.\n\n456\n00:20:42.510 --> 00:20:45.660\nSo you might have network connectivity\nissues where you can't get to Apple.\n\n457\n00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:47.460\nThere's other things like that.\n\n458\n00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:51.280\nAnother thing where I've seen this\nif you're putting in an Apple ID\n\n459\n00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:53.480\nthat's not verified.\n\n460\n00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:55.740\nYou can create an Apple ID\nwith no credit card.\n\n461\n00:20:55.740 --> 00:20:57.060\nBut then it's not verified, and\n\n462\n00:20:57.060 --> 00:20:58.940\na lot of times it won't generate\na certificate because of that.\n\n463\n00:20:58.940 --> 00:21:00.110\nSo it needs to be verified.\n\n464\n00:21:00.110 --> 00:21:03.270\nOr you get an email saying, hey you\ncreated this account, click here to\n\n465\n00:21:03.270 --> 00:21:06.850\nverify, and you've got to do that, so\nthat it can also generate that error.\n\n466\n00:21:06.850 --> 00:21:09.880\nI think in my case it's just a bad\npassword, so let me try that again and\n\n467\n00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:10.740\nwe'll see what happens.\n\n468\n00:21:10.740 --> 00:21:11.640\nThere we go.\n\n469\n00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:14.450\nAnd assuming you're verified,\nassuming everything's okay,\n\n470\n00:21:14.450 --> 00:21:18.390\nyou should get a message back that says,\nfinished and ready to enable.\n\n471\n00:21:18.390 --> 00:21:22.190\nAnd when that's done,\nnow my device management is enabled and\n\n472\n00:21:22.190 --> 00:21:24.370\nyou can see I can turn\non device enrollment or\n\n473\n00:21:24.370 --> 00:21:27.200\nvolume purchase if I'm in\neither of those programs.\n\n474\n00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:30.330\nI'm not, but they are there, and it would\nbe nice to be in them, but I'm not.\n\n475\n00:21:30.330 --> 00:21:34.120\nSo once that's done,\nI've now actually got two certificates.\n\n476\n00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:36.920\nI got one certificate that's\nthe self-signed one that we generated\n\n477\n00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:37.454\nourselves.\n\n478\n00:21:37.454 --> 00:21:41.560\nAnd then I got another one\nthat's truly signed by Apple and\n\n479\n00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:44.080\ntrusted by mobile devices\nthat are out there.\n\n480\n00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:48.190\nIf I enroll them in my profile manager,\nI'll now be able to push settings to them.\n\n481\n00:21:48.190 --> 00:21:51.310\nThat's really important that we have that\nbecause that's us sending signals to\n\n482\n00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:55.770\nthe phone, not the phone having\nto come and find data from us.\n\n483\n00:21:55.770 --> 00:21:58.930\nOnce that's done,\nI'm now running the profile manager.\n\n484\n00:21:58.930 --> 00:22:00.520\nWe're up and we're happy now.\n\n485\n00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:02.060\nThere’s still a lot of work to be done.\n\n486\n00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:03.900\nWe've gotta get in and\ncreate some profile.\n\n487\n00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:05.950\nWe've gotta put some settings in place.\n\n488\n00:22:05.950 --> 00:22:09.260\nAnd we gotta tell our clients\nto use the profile manager.\n\n489\n00:22:09.260 --> 00:22:11.280\nI'm getting to enroll them\nin the profile manager.\n\n490\n00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:15.040\nSo right now I’m kind of here, but\n\n491\n00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:17.470\nnow I need to start going\ndoing a little more work.\n\n492\n00:22:17.470 --> 00:22:19.860\nNow, right beneath here,\nbefore I move pass the server,\n\n493\n00:22:19.860 --> 00:22:23.650\nwe've got this default configuration\nprofile settings for everyone, right?\n\n494\n00:22:23.650 --> 00:22:25.110\nIf you hit Configure,\n\n495\n00:22:26.550 --> 00:22:29.710\nyou'll see that there's not a whole\nlot that we can do here, right?\n\n496\n00:22:29.710 --> 00:22:32.350\nYou can set the name for that and\nby default it's Settings for Everyone,\n\n497\n00:22:32.350 --> 00:22:33.960\nthat's what I normally leave it as.\n\n498\n00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:37.970\nBut you've also got, include\nconfiguration for services, all right,\n\n499\n00:22:37.970 --> 00:22:39.960\nNo Services Enabled.\n\n500\n00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:42.960\nAs we get this set up, we're gonna be\nable to put service settings in there and\n\n501\n00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:45.020\nthey're gonna be included here by default.\n\n502\n00:22:45.020 --> 00:22:46.260\nYou may not want that.\n\n503\n00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:48.390\nYou may just want to be\npushing other settings,\n\n504\n00:22:48.390 --> 00:22:50.130\nlike doing remote deployment software.\n\n505\n00:22:50.130 --> 00:22:52.850\nAnd you may choose to turn this off,\nbut it is on by default.\n\n506\n00:22:52.850 --> 00:22:54.200\nAnd for\nmost people if you don't set it up,\n\n507\n00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:56.050\nit doesn't really make a difference and,\nso we can leave it there.\n\n508\n00:22:56.050 --> 00:22:57.860\nBut I wanted to highlight that setting.\n\n509\n00:22:57.860 --> 00:23:01.029\nThat is one that you may or\nmay not need to mess with.\n\n510\n00:23:02.070 --> 00:23:04.590\nIf we turn that off, now my service\nsettings aren't gonna go with it.\n\n511\n00:23:04.590 --> 00:23:07.650\nIn my case, I don't have any services\nenabled, so I don't see anything.\n\n512\n00:23:07.650 --> 00:23:08.450\nLet me show you.\n\n513\n00:23:08.450 --> 00:23:11.910\nFor example,\nlet's say I turn on my mail server.\n\n514\n00:23:11.910 --> 00:23:14.080\nSo I'm gonna turn on\nthe mail server real quick.\n\n515\n00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:16.950\nAnd it is starting, and\nas soon as that's done.\n\n516\n00:23:16.950 --> 00:23:19.380\nOr I should have picked an easier one.\n\n517\n00:23:19.380 --> 00:23:20.380\nMail has a lot of stuff to it.\n\n518\n00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:21.790\nI'm gonna turn on messages.\n\n519\n00:23:21.790 --> 00:23:22.620\nSo we'll turn on messages.\n\n520\n00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:23.570\nThere we go.\n\n521\n00:23:23.570 --> 00:23:25.850\nAll right, so\nnow I'm running messages and mail.\n\n522\n00:23:25.850 --> 00:23:29.140\nAnd if I go back to my Profile Manager and\nI go into this Settings for\n\n523\n00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:34.370\nEveryone, notice how it shows\na little messages icon.\n\n524\n00:23:34.370 --> 00:23:36.820\nAnd if I uncheck that,\nit's not gonna push it.\n\n525\n00:23:36.820 --> 00:23:38.488\nBut if I leave it checked,\nit is gonna push it.\n\n526\n00:23:38.488 --> 00:23:43.312\nWhat that means is, if I have a client\nthat's managed by this profile manager,\n\n527\n00:23:43.312 --> 00:23:47.992\nthey'll automatically configure\nthemselves to use our messaging server,\n\n528\n00:23:47.992 --> 00:23:52.030\nor our mail server, or whatever\nother service it is that I turn on.\n\n529\n00:23:52.030 --> 00:23:54.148\nMail is still getting set up,\nthat's why I don't see messages.\n\n530\n00:23:54.148 --> 00:23:56.780\nBut they'll automatically get set up for\nthis.\n\n531\n00:23:56.780 --> 00:23:57.698\nAnd I might not want that.\n\n532\n00:23:57.698 --> 00:23:59.618\nI don't necessarily want\nthem to use my services.\n\n533\n00:23:59.618 --> 00:24:01.190\nI just wanna push settings to them.\n\n534\n00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:03.250\nAnd so, I could turn that off and\nthat wouldn't be a problem, right?\n\n535\n00:24:03.250 --> 00:24:05.068\nSo, just be aware that that's\nsomething you can do here.\n\n536\n00:24:05.068 --> 00:24:08.240\nIf you forget about it,\nit can push the settings out already, and\n\n537\n00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:10.850\nthen you gotta go through and\nturn them off to undo it.\n\n538\n00:24:10.850 --> 00:24:13.940\nSo, it's kinda better to fix this\nbeforehand than it is afterwards.\n\n539\n00:24:15.660 --> 00:24:17.840\nAll right, so we're pretty good there.\n\n540\n00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:22.100\nThe only other thing I guess that's\nworth mentioning is certificates.\n\n541\n00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:25.020\nRight, I mentioned I have a couple of\ncertificates now and if I go back up to my\n\n542\n00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:29.040\ncertificates folder, I'll see where\nit's created these IntermeidateCA ones.\n\n543\n00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:31.955\nSo, there's my main certificate and\nmy code signing certificate.\n\n544\n00:24:31.955 --> 00:24:35.140\nI didn't turn on signing for\nthe profile, did I?\n\n545\n00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:39.090\nSo, back in to the profile manager you've\ngot that sign configuration profiles you\n\n546\n00:24:39.090 --> 00:24:40.290\ncan turn on.\n\n547\n00:24:40.290 --> 00:24:41.750\nAnd so,\nnow when we start to push the profiles,\n\n548\n00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:43.700\nthey'll be digitally signed\nwith our certificate.\n\n549\n00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:46.170\nYou normally do want that.\n\n550\n00:24:46.170 --> 00:24:49.338\nThe end users will just get\na warning if it's not turned on.\n\n551\n00:24:49.338 --> 00:24:54.051\nAll right, at this point,\nI'm kinda good to go on the, shoot.\n\n552\n00:24:54.051 --> 00:24:56.072\nI chose to assign\nthe configuration profile and\n\n553\n00:24:56.072 --> 00:24:59.354\nI just need to pick the certificate,\nyou've only got the one in this case, so\n\n554\n00:24:59.354 --> 00:25:01.090\nit makes it easy, so I'll choose that.\n\n555\n00:25:02.110 --> 00:25:06.076\nAll right, so at this point,\nI'm kinda up and good to go on the server.\n\n556\n00:25:06.076 --> 00:25:09.054\nMy next step is really enrolling\na client in the profile manager, so\n\n557\n00:25:09.054 --> 00:25:10.532\nI can start to manage it, right?\n\n558\n00:25:10.532 --> 00:25:13.820\nWell, in order to enroll it,\nthey need to be able to see each other and\n\n559\n00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:16.201\nthe best thing to do is to\nhave an open directory and\n\n560\n00:25:16.201 --> 00:25:19.179\nhave an open directory where they\ncan login and be bound to it.\n\n561\n00:25:19.179 --> 00:25:20.970\nWe saw that in the last episode.\n\n562\n00:25:20.970 --> 00:25:23.200\nSo, you usually have user\naccounts created here and\n\n563\n00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:25.410\nyou'll see like I've got an account for\nWes, and\n\n564\n00:25:25.410 --> 00:25:29.040\nWes is in the Local Network Directory,\nso he's already a network user.\n\n565\n00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:31.290\nI might wanna create groups also.\n\n566\n00:25:31.290 --> 00:25:32.550\nTo be able to group the users together.\n\n567\n00:25:32.550 --> 00:25:37.090\nThat's important, because when I push\na profile out, I might say I want this\n\n568\n00:25:37.090 --> 00:25:41.210\nprofile to apply to teachers and\nnot students, or vice versa.\n\n569\n00:25:41.210 --> 00:25:43.860\nThen so, we can use groups inside of\nthe profile manager to apply that, and\n\n570\n00:25:43.860 --> 00:25:45.580\nwe can also use it for permissions.\n\n571\n00:25:45.580 --> 00:25:49.450\nSo, that's all stuff that you may\nuse optionally choose to set up for\n\n572\n00:25:49.450 --> 00:25:50.220\nyour profile manager.\n\n573\n00:25:51.860 --> 00:25:56.790\nAll right, in my case,\nI'm not gonna set up any of the others.\n\n574\n00:25:56.790 --> 00:25:57.423\nWe've got you.\n\n575\n00:25:57.423 --> 00:25:58.392\nWe'll use you, Wes, as our guinea pig.\n\n576\n00:25:58.392 --> 00:25:59.053\n>> Okay.\n\n577\n00:25:59.053 --> 00:26:01.520\n>> I've got a profile that I\nwanna push out to mess with you.\n\n578\n00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:04.527\nSo, at this point, I'm good to go.\n\n579\n00:26:04.527 --> 00:26:07.210\nLet's jump in and\ntake a look at the Profile Manager.\n\n580\n00:26:07.210 --> 00:26:11.260\nAll right, now I mentioned that we\nhave a web interface that we use and\n\n581\n00:26:11.260 --> 00:26:12.310\nif we go back here and\n\n582\n00:26:12.310 --> 00:26:15.540\nit's telling me that we're available\nright there at that Profile Manager link.\n\n583\n00:26:15.540 --> 00:26:18.590\nAnd right down here at the bottom I\ncan use that shortcut to launch it.\n\n584\n00:26:18.590 --> 00:26:22.330\nThere's actually another little\nshortcut that you can use.\n\n585\n00:26:22.330 --> 00:26:22.890\nThis one right here.\n\n586\n00:26:22.890 --> 00:26:24.290\nLearn about configuring devices for\n\n587\n00:26:24.290 --> 00:26:27.052\nthis service that you can hit that'll\ntake you into the web browser too.\n\n588\n00:26:27.052 --> 00:26:30.890\nBut, the one that most of us want is\nthis guy down here, profile manager.\n\n589\n00:26:30.890 --> 00:26:32.960\nI'm gonna open that up in Safari.\n\n590\n00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:36.748\nAnd it's gonna browse to my server and\nit's gonna make me log in.\n\n591\n00:26:36.748 --> 00:26:40.567\nAll right, now when I log in, I need to\nlog in as an administrator on the system,\n\n592\n00:26:40.567 --> 00:26:43.120\nso that I can well administer things,\nright?\n\n593\n00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:46.930\nAnd I do have an administrator account,\ncalled Don Pazet, and\n\n594\n00:26:46.930 --> 00:26:49.240\nassuming I can remember my password,\nI can get logged in.\n\n595\n00:26:50.270 --> 00:26:53.480\nAnd we should be greeted\nwith the profile manager.\n\n596\n00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:55.970\nI'm gonna break security practices\nhere and save my password.\n\n597\n00:26:55.970 --> 00:26:58.680\nI know people are cringing out there.\n\n598\n00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:01.700\nBut, once we get logged in,\nwe see what is actually a pretty\n\n599\n00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:05.218\nrobust management interface for\nthe profile manager.\n\n600\n00:27:05.218 --> 00:27:09.138\nAnd there's this quite a bit of\nstuff nest their way in here.\n\n601\n00:27:09.138 --> 00:27:12.839\nIt's designed to be a pretty easy and\nstraightforward system to use, but\n\n602\n00:27:12.839 --> 00:27:15.540\nthere's so\nmany options that it gets overwhelming.\n\n603\n00:27:16.620 --> 00:27:20.182\nNow, when I come in here,\nI'm in my Profile Manager, and\n\n604\n00:27:20.182 --> 00:27:25.219\nit defaults to the groups folder, and\nit defaults to the everyone group, right?\n\n605\n00:27:25.219 --> 00:27:29.134\nAnd it's doing that because these\nare the settings that are the settings for\n\n606\n00:27:29.134 --> 00:27:33.180\neveryone, the settings that apply\nto everyone in my environment.\n\n607\n00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:36.510\nI can start to create more groups for\nother people.\n\n608\n00:27:36.510 --> 00:27:38.540\nI mentioned like students and teachers.\n\n609\n00:27:38.540 --> 00:27:39.730\nAnd so, I can create more groups.\n\n610\n00:27:39.730 --> 00:27:42.980\nNow notice, I don't have like an add\nbutton, I just have this refresh button,\n\n611\n00:27:42.980 --> 00:27:47.010\nbecause I've gotta create those\ngroups over in the server app.\n\n612\n00:27:47.010 --> 00:27:49.760\nAnd then, when I hit refresh they'll show\nup in here, so I can create teachers,\n\n613\n00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:55.000\nstudents, laptops, desktops, whatever it\nis that I wanna use to divide up systems.\n\n614\n00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.180\nAnd people can be in more than one group.\n\n615\n00:27:57.180 --> 00:28:01.610\nI might have somebody who's a teacher, but\nthey're also administrative staff, and so\n\n616\n00:28:01.610 --> 00:28:03.080\nI have them in two different groups and\n\n617\n00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:05.820\nthey'll get kinda\na combination of the settings.\n\n618\n00:28:05.820 --> 00:28:10.530\nAnd then over here, we get our first kind\nof highlight of what those settings are.\n\n619\n00:28:10.530 --> 00:28:12.280\nYou'll see that there's\na lot of stuff in here.\n\n620\n00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:13.880\nJust basic restrictions.\n\n621\n00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:18.370\nWe've got apps and books,\nactivity and so on.\n\n622\n00:28:18.370 --> 00:28:21.530\nEach one of these\nare collections of Settings.\n\n623\n00:28:21.530 --> 00:28:27.300\nWhen I go under Settings, I don't see\na whole lot, but I do see messages, right?\n\n624\n00:28:27.300 --> 00:28:31.520\nI'm pushing a configuration for messages\ncuz I had that option turned on in\n\n625\n00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:33.520\nsettings for\neveryone back in the server app.\n\n626\n00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:36.440\nIf I turn that off, this wouldn't be here\nand I actually wouldn't see anything.\n\n627\n00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:39.330\nOkay, well,\nyou always see Enrollment Settings.\n\n628\n00:28:39.330 --> 00:28:42.140\nUnder apps, I see nothing, no apps.\n\n629\n00:28:42.140 --> 00:28:44.420\nUnder books, I see nothing, no books.\n\n630\n00:28:44.420 --> 00:28:46.730\nI haven't configured any of that yet,\nright?\n\n631\n00:28:46.730 --> 00:28:51.480\nSo, when you first fire this up,\nmost of what you see is empty.\n\n632\n00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:52.900\nAnd then it's up to us to go and\n\n633\n00:28:52.900 --> 00:28:57.480\nconfigure all of those settings\nexactly the way that we want, so\n\n634\n00:28:57.480 --> 00:29:00.780\nthat we can start managing those services,\nthose settings, and those other features.\n\n635\n00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:03.590\nSo, if you go into an environment where\nthey've been running the profile manager\n\n636\n00:29:03.590 --> 00:29:08.270\na long time, you might come to one of\nthese screens and see tons of data on it,\n\n637\n00:29:08.270 --> 00:29:11.180\nor you might just see two little boxes\nlike I'm seeing cuz it's brand new.\n\n638\n00:29:11.180 --> 00:29:13.860\nAll right, but in the next episode\nwhat we're gonna do is run through and\n\n639\n00:29:13.860 --> 00:29:16.280\nget these set up and you'll start\nto see a ton of these options.\n\n640\n00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:18.337\nIn fact,\nthose really the next two steps we need.\n\n641\n00:29:18.337 --> 00:29:23.132\nStep one, we need to create some profiles.\n\n642\n00:29:23.132 --> 00:29:27.153\nAnd in step two, we need to apply\nthem to a client to see it in action.\n\n643\n00:29:27.153 --> 00:29:29.550\nSo, we're gonna see that, but\nI know I don't have enough time for that.\n\n644\n00:29:29.550 --> 00:29:30.810\nBut let me just show you one more thing.\n\n645\n00:29:30.810 --> 00:29:33.560\nI mentioned those groups, and\nhow we can get them created.\n\n646\n00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:35.490\nThere's two types of groups.\n\n647\n00:29:35.490 --> 00:29:39.490\nThere's groups for user accounts,\nand there's groups for devices.\n\n648\n00:29:39.490 --> 00:29:41.910\nFor your user accounts,\nyou can actually go under users.\n\n649\n00:29:41.910 --> 00:29:44.760\nAnd I can create profiles\nthat apply to a single user,\n\n650\n00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:46.590\nif I wanna be really specific.\n\n651\n00:29:46.590 --> 00:29:50.750\nBut groups work better, and with the\ngroups, I can go back to my server app,\n\n652\n00:29:50.750 --> 00:29:54.020\nI can go to groups and\nI can create my groups right here.\n\n653\n00:29:54.020 --> 00:29:57.850\nI just have to be careful, when you create\na group it's gotta be a network group.\n\n654\n00:29:57.850 --> 00:30:00.130\nIf I choose a local group\nit's not gonna work.\n\n655\n00:30:00.130 --> 00:30:02.752\nAnd so,\nI'm gonna create a network group and\n\n656\n00:30:02.752 --> 00:30:05.657\nmaybe I'll create one called Teachers,\nright?\n\n657\n00:30:05.657 --> 00:30:09.460\nAnd, I'll say okay to that one.\n\n658\n00:30:09.460 --> 00:30:11.370\nAnd then,\nI'll create another one called Students.\n\n659\n00:30:15.570 --> 00:30:16.360\nWe'll say okay to that.\n\n660\n00:30:17.610 --> 00:30:19.940\nAll right, so now I've created\nthe students and the teachers.\n\n661\n00:30:19.940 --> 00:30:21.880\nAnd I can put user accounts into those, so\n\n662\n00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:24.180\nI know who's a teacher and\nwho's a student.\n\n663\n00:30:24.180 --> 00:30:27.870\nAnd if I go back here to profile manager,\nthey already showed up.\n\n664\n00:30:27.870 --> 00:30:30.350\nSometimes they don't show up right away,\nand that's why there's a refresh button,\n\n665\n00:30:30.350 --> 00:30:31.760\nwhich is what I was just\nabout to point out,\n\n666\n00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:33.620\nbut I don't need it cuz\nthey show up right away.\n\n667\n00:30:33.620 --> 00:30:34.520\nSo, there we go.\n\n668\n00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:37.430\nI've got students and teachers, right?\n\n669\n00:30:37.430 --> 00:30:40.160\nBut you can group your computers also.\n\n670\n00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:42.750\nI might have laptops and desktops.\n\n671\n00:30:42.750 --> 00:30:46.720\nWell, the server app doesn't\ndo computer objects.\n\n672\n00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:48.230\nIt doesn't give you a way to do that.\n\n673\n00:30:48.230 --> 00:30:50.660\nSo, that's why we have\ndevice groups up here.\n\n674\n00:30:50.660 --> 00:30:52.920\nSo, you can start to create\ndevices in device groups.\n\n675\n00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:55.057\nNow under devices,\nI don't have any devices yet, so\n\n676\n00:30:55.057 --> 00:30:57.320\nI just see the space to\nthe enrollment screen.\n\n677\n00:30:57.320 --> 00:31:00.379\nBut if I go to device groups,\nI can start to create device groups.\n\n678\n00:31:00.379 --> 00:31:05.416\nAnd so, I'm gonna add one here,\njust called new device group,\n\n679\n00:31:05.416 --> 00:31:09.239\nand once it gets created\nI can change its name, so\n\n680\n00:31:09.239 --> 00:31:14.299\nI'm gonna make this one laptops,\nright, and I'll save that.\n\n681\n00:31:14.299 --> 00:31:20.984\nAnd then, I can create another one and\nI'll call this one Desktops, right?\n\n682\n00:31:20.984 --> 00:31:24.450\nI might have one power management profile\nthat I wanna roll out for laptops.\n\n683\n00:31:24.450 --> 00:31:27.530\nThat's aggressive and a different power\nmanagement profile that I roll out to\n\n684\n00:31:27.530 --> 00:31:29.640\ndesktop that's not as aggressive, right?\n\n685\n00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:32.029\nSo, now I can do that cuz\nI've created the groups.\n\n686\n00:31:32.029 --> 00:31:35.032\nAnd as I enroll computers\nin my profile manager,\n\n687\n00:31:35.032 --> 00:31:37.608\nI'll be able to put them in these groups.\n\n688\n00:31:37.608 --> 00:31:40.482\nSo, I can say yeah, that's a laptop or\nyeah that's a desktop by putting it in\n\n689\n00:31:40.482 --> 00:31:42.400\nthe right group and\nstarting to work with it there.\n\n690\n00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:46.046\nSo, that's another kinda basic framework\nthing you've gotta do early on in setting\n\n691\n00:31:46.046 --> 00:31:47.118\nup the profile manager.\n\n692\n00:31:47.118 --> 00:31:49.345\n>> All right, looks like we're\nout of time for this episode.\n\n693\n00:31:49.345 --> 00:31:51.145\nDon, got anything else for us?\n\n694\n00:31:51.145 --> 00:31:54.933\n>> I've got a ton Wes, but we definitely\ncan't cover it in this last minute,\n\n695\n00:31:54.933 --> 00:31:57.235\nso stay tuned,\nwe're gonna have a part two.\n\n696\n00:31:57.235 --> 00:31:59.860\nWe gotta get a client join, we gotta\nget some settings in place, we've seen\n\n697\n00:31:59.860 --> 00:32:02.377\nthe rate of the profile manager,\nwe haven't actually utilized it yet.\n\n698\n00:32:02.377 --> 00:32:03.151\nAnd that's where the real fun is.\n\n699\n00:32:03.151 --> 00:32:04.205\nSo, stay tuned for that.\n\n700\n00:32:04.205 --> 00:32:08.376\n>> Plenty more to come but signing off for\nIT PRO.TV, I've been your host Wes Bryan.\n\n701\n00:32:08.376 --> 00:32:09.120\n>> And I'm Don Peset.\n\n702\n00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:11.082\n>> And we'll see you next

00:00:16.041\nI'm your host Wes Bryan,\nand in this episode,\n\n4\n00:00:16.041 --> 00:00:19.972\nwe're gonna be moving along\nin our Mac Management basics.\n\n5\n00:00:19.972 --> 00:00:23.728\nAnd we're coming at you with a part two,\nyeah, we talked a lot in the first one.\n\n6\n00:00:23.728 --> 00:00:25.986\nBut we still got plenty\nof more good information.\n\n7\n00:00:25.986 --> 00:00:30.829\nWe have a man that I'm still convinced\nthat has binary and not DNA, Mr.\n\n8\n00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:31.646\nDon Pezet.\n\n9\n00:00:31.646 --> 00:00:33.922\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Wes, thanks for\nhaving me back on the show.\n\n10\n00:00:33.922 --> 00:00:37.684\nAnd yeah, like I said, we're continuing\noff of where we left on profile managers.\n\n11\n00:00:37.684 --> 00:00:42.166\nSo if you watched our last episode,\nI showed you guys how to set up a profile\n\n12\n00:00:42.166 --> 00:00:45.222\nmanager on a server, and\nto get it up and running.\n\n13\n00:00:45.222 --> 00:00:48.151\nAnd then we didn't actually\nuse the darn thing, right?\n\n14\n00:00:48.151 --> 00:00:49.581\nWe spent the whole episode\njust getting fired up.\n\n15\n00:00:49.581 --> 00:00:52.456\nSo in this episode,\nwe're going to actually use it.\n\n16\n00:00:52.456 --> 00:00:54.019\nWe're gonna take it and\nkind of put it to some use.\n\n17\n00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:57.980\nSo basically there's two main tasks that\nwe didn't get to in the last episode.\n\n18\n00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.855\nThe first is just creating profiles,\nI need to create some collections\n\n19\n00:01:01.855 --> 00:01:04.650\nof settings that I can\npush out to my clients.\n\n20\n00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.390\nAnd then the second thing is,\nwell pushing that to the clients,\n\n21\n00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.180\nactually using those profiles and\ngetting them in place.\n\n22\n00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.940\nSo we're gonna take a look at both\nof those right here in this episode,\n\n23\n00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:13.790\nand well we'll just get started.\n\n24\n00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.536\nSo in the last episode, in case you\nmissed it, I created a couple of groups.\n\n25\n00:01:17.536 --> 00:01:20.344\nI created a group called laptops and\na group called desktops, so\n\n26\n00:01:20.344 --> 00:01:23.450\nthat I could create profiles and\npush them out based on those.\n\n27\n00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.840\nAnd I created a group called students and\na group called teachers,\n\n28\n00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.730\nbecause I might have really,\nreally tight restrictions on students.\n\n29\n00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:34.130\nAnd less restrictions on teachers so\nthey can go in and modify things.\n\n30\n00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.739\nSo we created those groups and\nthose are gonna serve as the framework for\n\n31\n00:01:37.739 --> 00:01:41.063\nour profiles, but we didn't\nactually create profiles on them.\n\n32\n00:01:41.063 --> 00:01:43.116\nAnd there's one profile\nthat was already created.\n\n33\n00:01:43.116 --> 00:01:47.379\nWe did see that in the last episode,\nwhich is the settings for everyone, right?\n\n34\n00:01:47.379 --> 00:01:50.979\nSettings for everyone, that's where we\nhave settings that apply to everybody\n\n35\n00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:52.872\nregardless of what profile they're in.\n\n36\n00:01:52.872 --> 00:01:55.070\nIt's kind of like a default profile.\n\n37\n00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.300\nSo when we decide to implement\nthe profile manager,\n\n38\n00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:01.210\nfirst thing we need to do is think about\nwhere we want our settings to apply.\n\n39\n00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.570\nIf I have settings I want\nto apply to everybody,\n\n40\n00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.210\nI should put them in the settings for\neveryone profile.\n\n41\n00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.513\nBut if I just have them for\na particular group of people,\n\n42\n00:02:08.513 --> 00:02:10.184\nI need to create a group to support that.\n\n43\n00:02:10.184 --> 00:02:13.380\nSo we've kind of already done that and\nwe're ready to dive in.\n\n44\n00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.002\nOne thing I do wanna tweak though,\nI'm gonna go on my server.\n\n45\n00:02:16.002 --> 00:02:17.807\nAnd I know I highlighted\nthis in the last episode.\n\n46\n00:02:17.807 --> 00:02:22.117\nBut when we have services like Messages,\nconfigured or whatever.\n\n47\n00:02:22.117 --> 00:02:26.325\nThe Profile Manager can automatically push\ntheir settings out to our clients, and\n\n48\n00:02:26.325 --> 00:02:27.479\nI left that turned on.\n\n49\n00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:30.648\nSo here we've got this default\nconfiguration profile settings for\n\n50\n00:02:30.648 --> 00:02:31.860\neveryone.\n\n51\n00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.720\nAnd in the configuration for it,\nI'm including a configuration for\n\n52\n00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:35.760\nthose services.\n\n53\n00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.360\nI'm just gonna uncheck that so\nthat I don't include it.\n\n54\n00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.380\nI can always change my mind later and\nput them back.\n\n55\n00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.150\nBut for right now, I wanna make sure\nthat the only settings in the profile\n\n56\n00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.949\nare ones that I put there myself,\nnot ones that are automatically made.\n\n57\n00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.550\nAll right, once that's done, I can jump\ninto my profile manager and get to work.\n\n58\n00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:54.940\nSo to get into the Profile Manager I just\nneed to go, well into Safari, right?\n\n59\n00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.050\nYou can browse to your server\nname slash profile manager.\n\n60\n00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:02.254\nOr since I'm already in the server app I\ncan just use this short cut right here,\n\n61\n00:03:02.254 --> 00:03:04.368\nto open the Profile Manager in Safari.\n\n62\n00:03:04.368 --> 00:03:08.144\nAll right, now once I'm in there, what I'm\ngonna see are the different groups, and\n\n63\n00:03:08.144 --> 00:03:10.310\nsettings, and\nthings that I've already made.\n\n64\n00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.390\nSo here we can see the everyone group,\nthat's the settings for\n\n65\n00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:15.370\neveryone I was talking about.\n\n66\n00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.639\nAnd then there's Students,\nthere's Teachers.\n\n67\n00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:20.506\nIf I go under my Device Groups,\nI'll see Laptops and Desktops.\n\n68\n00:03:20.506 --> 00:03:23.240\nThose are all the ones we\nmade in the last episode.\n\n69\n00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:26.380\nWell if I have a setting I\nwant to apply to everyone,\n\n70\n00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.050\nthen I need to go right here to this\nEveryone group and put it there.\n\n71\n00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:33.830\nUsually there's not a whole lot we want\nto apply to everyone in our company.\n\n72\n00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:35.936\nBut a great example is a password policy,\nright?\n\n73\n00:03:35.936 --> 00:03:40.935\nA lot of companies have a minimum password\nstrength policy or a password rotation.\n\n74\n00:03:40.935 --> 00:03:42.308\nSo let's say, 90 days,\n\n75\n00:03:42.308 --> 00:03:46.570\nI wanna make sure that all of my employees\nchange their password every 90 days.\n\n76\n00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:49.560\nWell if you have a local\nMAC account on a MAC,\n\n77\n00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.640\nhow often does it make\nyou change password?\n\n78\n00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:54.910\nNever, your password lasts forever.\n\n79\n00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:57.499\nIf you have an open directory account, how\noften do you have to change your password?\n\n80\n00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.290\nNever, it doesn't make you do it.\n\n81\n00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:04.350\nSo the default configurations on a Mac are\nthat you could have a password forever.\n\n82\n00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:07.143\nBut I can enforce a password expiration\nright here, and I'm gonna do that.\n\n83\n00:04:07.143 --> 00:04:11.530\nI'm gonna go under Everyone, and then\nover here I start to see the Settings.\n\n84\n00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:14.920\nAnd we're gonna see a lot of different\nsettings that pertain to these profiles,\n\n85\n00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.380\nmost of which we aren't really\ngoing to even mess with.\n\n86\n00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:19.511\nSome of them you'll see\nare pretty important,\n\n87\n00:04:19.511 --> 00:04:21.647\nlike Allow configuration\nprofile downloads.\n\n88\n00:04:21.647 --> 00:04:24.590\n[LAUGH] I kinda need them to be\nable to download it to install it.\n\n89\n00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:27.560\nOtherwise, I'm gonna have to put the\nprofile on a USB key and take it over and\n\n90\n00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:28.870\ninstall it, which is a little bit of work.\n\n91\n00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.854\nWe've got device enrollment and\nunenrollment,\n\n92\n00:04:31.854 --> 00:04:35.194\nwhether I wanna allow people to join into\nthis or not, and typically, we want that.\n\n93\n00:04:35.194 --> 00:04:39.380\nAllow device lock, allow passcodes\nto be cleared, allow device wipe.\n\n94\n00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:41.110\nDo I want to enable that functionality?\n\n95\n00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:44.750\nYou don't have to, but honestly,\nit's a great functionality.\n\n96\n00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:45.658\nWhy would you want to turn that off?\n\n97\n00:04:45.658 --> 00:04:49.701\nWell you might not want a student\nto figure out a Teacher's password.\n\n98\n00:04:49.701 --> 00:04:52.221\nAnd then remote wipe their machine,\nbecause they're being funny, right?\n\n99\n00:04:52.221 --> 00:04:56.655\nYou could potentially do that, so that's\nwhy you wanna turn those things off.\n\n100\n00:04:56.655 --> 00:05:02.766\nWhen you go into the Settings tab,\nthis is where we see all of the settings,\n\n101\n00:05:02.766 --> 00:05:05.679\nand I don't see a lot here, right?\n\n102\n00:05:05.679 --> 00:05:09.830\nI see allow activation lock\ncommand after an MDM enrollment.\n\n103\n00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:12.860\nIn other words,\nonce they sign it up into MDM,\n\n104\n00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:16.890\ndo I want to allow them to\nbe able to lock the machine?\n\n105\n00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:18.610\nAs far as activating it to work, right?\n\n106\n00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:20.400\nSo can I block the machine off and\n\n107\n00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.370\nnot allow it to be activated\non anybody else's system?\n\n108\n00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:24.954\nWell, if I'm not\nsupporting mobile devices,\n\n109\n00:05:24.954 --> 00:05:26.666\nthat doesn't really mean anything to me,\nright?\n\n110\n00:05:26.666 --> 00:05:29.700\nIf I'm just supporting laptops and\ndesktops, I don't care about that.\n\n111\n00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:31.315\nBut for mobile phones, that really helps.\n\n112\n00:05:31.315 --> 00:05:33.884\nCuz when people steal a phone,\na lot of times what they do,\n\n113\n00:05:33.884 --> 00:05:35.995\nis they just erase the phone and\nsell it on eBay.\n\n114\n00:05:35.995 --> 00:05:39.142\nWell if I do an activation lock on it,\nif they erase the phone,\n\n115\n00:05:39.142 --> 00:05:42.664\nthey won't be able to activate it,\nwhich means they can't sell it.\n\n116\n00:05:42.664 --> 00:05:45.983\nSo you basically kind of killed off\nthe ability to sell that phone,\n\n117\n00:05:45.983 --> 00:05:47.119\nwhich is a good thing.\n\n118\n00:05:47.119 --> 00:05:49.640\nBut under general settings here,\nI've got basically nothing.\n\n119\n00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:53.970\nIt just says general and that's it, and\nthere's no real setting in this profile.\n\n120\n00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:55.870\nEven the activation lock is not turned on,\nso\n\n121\n00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:58.660\nthis profile is effectively\nempty by default.\n\n122\n00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:00.280\nI need to add settings.\n\n123\n00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:02.750\nSo I'm gonna go under General,\nand I'll hit Edit.\n\n124\n00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:06.870\nAnd now, we get our first glance at\nwhat a Configuration Profile looks like.\n\n125\n00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:09.543\nThe Configurations Profiles,\nthey're broken up into three sections.\n\n126\n00:06:09.543 --> 00:06:13.417\nSo on the left side here, I'm gonna see\nall the different things I can configure,\n\n127\n00:06:13.417 --> 00:06:17.080\nGeneral, Passcode, Mail, Exchange,\nLDAP, Contacts, and so on.\n\n128\n00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:20.604\nIt's actually a very long list, okay?\n\n129\n00:06:20.604 --> 00:06:25.250\nNow when you look at it you might notice\nthat there's some duplicates in here.\n\n130\n00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:28.745\nThere's some items that show up more\nthan once, and you might wonder why.\n\n131\n00:06:28.745 --> 00:06:30.677\nIs Apple just trying to make\nit look like there's more?\n\n132\n00:06:30.677 --> 00:06:34.800\nWell, it's actually divided up\nbased on the type of devices.\n\n133\n00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:39.239\nThere's some settings that\napplied both to OS X and iOS,\n\n134\n00:06:39.239 --> 00:06:42.208\nthere is other settings that don't.\n\n135\n00:06:42.208 --> 00:06:47.679\nIf I keep scrolling down here is a section\nof things that only work on iOS.\n\n136\n00:06:47.679 --> 00:06:52.013\nAnd beyond that, here is a section\nthings that only work on OS X.\n\n137\n00:06:52.013 --> 00:06:54.724\nAnd so there might be a duplicate,\nthere might be a setting that shows\n\n138\n00:06:54.724 --> 00:06:56.940\nup under both, but\nit's implemented a different way.\n\n139\n00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:00.280\nSo they had to split them out,\nthey couldn't group them together, right?\n\n140\n00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:04.280\nSo when I go to make my settings, I need\nto be aware of that differentiation,\n\n141\n00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:08.700\nthat there's some things that only work in\nOS X, some things that only work in iOS,\n\n142\n00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:12.800\nand other things that work in both, right?\n\n143\n00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:15.060\nAnd for me, I'm just looking for\npasswords, right?\n\n144\n00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:17.380\nI want to set a maximum password age so\n\n145\n00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:20.390\nthat people have to change\ntheir password every 90 days.\n\n146\n00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:22.687\nSo that's gonna be under Passcode.\n\n147\n00:07:22.687 --> 00:07:25.711\nAnd when I go under Passcode, right\nover here, I can see Configure Passcode.\n\n148\n00:07:25.711 --> 00:07:29.420\nAnd it's empty right now, which means\nI have not passcode configuration.\n\n149\n00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:31.680\nSo I can hit the Configure button, and\n\n150\n00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:34.470\nnow it's gonna add those\nsetting to the profile.\n\n151\n00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:37.627\nSo the profile was empty,\nnow it's got all these settings in it.\n\n152\n00:07:37.627 --> 00:07:40.183\nWell, most of them aren't set, but\nI can come in and define that.\n\n153\n00:07:40.183 --> 00:07:45.964\nAnd so we can specify what we want people\nto use, as far as their restriction now.\n\n154\n00:07:45.964 --> 00:07:52.266\nIf I want to set a Maximum Age,\nsomewhere in here, we can find that.\n\n155\n00:07:52.266 --> 00:07:54.339\nLet's see, Passcode History, so\n\n156\n00:07:54.339 --> 00:07:57.458\nsometimes the trick is just\nfinding the one you want.\n\n157\n00:07:57.458 --> 00:07:58.676\nThere it is, Maximum Passcode Age.\n\n158\n00:07:58.676 --> 00:08:01.237\nThat's the one I want, and\nI want it to be 90 days.\n\n159\n00:08:01.237 --> 00:08:03.613\nSo I'm gonna set that limit, 90 days.\n\n160\n00:08:03.613 --> 00:08:06.654\nIf your password gets over 90 days,\nyou're gonna have to reset it, all right.\n\n161\n00:08:06.654 --> 00:08:08.390\nBut that's just one of\nthe various settings.\n\n162\n00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:09.530\nThere is a ton of other things in here.\n\n163\n00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:11.030\nI can set a minimum length.\n\n164\n00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:12.650\nHey, you've got to be 8 characters or\n\n165\n00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:15.900\nmore, ops, my mouse jumps all over,\nthere we go.\n\n166\n00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:18.700\nYou have 8 characters or more or\nit's not just a strong password.\n\n167\n00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:19.350\nWe can say,\n\n168\n00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:23.360\nhey you've gotta have at least one\ncomplex character, one non alphanumeric.\n\n169\n00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:29.050\nI might want an auto-lock if somebody\ngets passwords wrong enough times,\n\n170\n00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:30.350\nwe lock them out.\n\n171\n00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:33.240\nHistory, I don't want people\nto reuse their passwords.\n\n172\n00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:35.210\nSo I might set that to five, right.\n\n173\n00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:41.120\nSo you can't reuse a pass code unless\nyou had five other passwords between it.\n\n174\n00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:42.440\nGrace period for device lock.\n\n175\n00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:44.910\nThere's all sorts of different little\nthings we can kind of tweak in here to\n\n176\n00:08:44.910 --> 00:08:48.640\nhave fun with to tighten\nup that password policy.\n\n177\n00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:50.600\nSo, I can define all of that right here.\n\n178\n00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:55.430\nAnd now when I save it, what it's gonna\ndo it's gonna take all these settings and\n\n179\n00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:57.460\nit's gonna put it in the profile.\n\n180\n00:08:57.460 --> 00:08:59.480\nSo, when I say okay to that,\n\n181\n00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:04.760\nnow a minute ago it just said general\nnow it says general and passcode.\n\n182\n00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:07.480\nRight?\nSo, I can visually see that I've got these\n\n183\n00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:09.070\nextra settings that\nare part of this profile.\n\n184\n00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:12.630\nAnd if I ever edit this,\nI can just go right back in here and\n\n185\n00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:15.880\nfind that profile bit, and\nfind passcode, and we can edit it.\n\n186\n00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:17.810\nAnd you can always spot\nthe ones that are installed,\n\n187\n00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:19.770\ncuz the ones that aren't\nsay not configured.\n\n188\n00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:23.300\nAnd the ones that are, will say\nsomething like this, payload configured.\n\n189\n00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:25.370\nThose settings have been\nput into the profile.\n\n190\n00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:30.450\nAll right, but now that that's\nset that's on my everyone group.\n\n191\n00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:33.790\nAnd so this is going to apply to everyone\nthat's registered to this server,\n\n192\n00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:34.790\nall the users.\n\n193\n00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:37.070\n&gt;&gt; Now, Don,\nlike you said the everyone group there.\n\n194\n00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:38.830\nBut what if I need to get\na little bit more specific.\n\n195\n00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:41.170\nI don't want a setting\napplying to everyone.\n\n196\n00:09:41.170 --> 00:09:43.710\nFor example,\nI've got some settings for students.\n\n197\n00:09:43.710 --> 00:09:44.530\nAnd I've got some settings for\n\n198\n00:09:44.530 --> 00:09:48.850\nstudents on those groups there\nnot necessarily the same.\n\n199\n00:09:48.850 --> 00:09:53.930\nYeah, for school we see a lot of times\nlike a lockdown policy for your students.\n\n200\n00:09:53.930 --> 00:09:56.350\nI don't want my students getting\ninto the system preferences or\n\n201\n00:09:56.350 --> 00:09:58.750\nchanging wallpapers or installing apps.\n\n202\n00:09:58.750 --> 00:10:01.940\nSo I can create a profile that's\nvery restrictive for them and\n\n203\n00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:03.570\nlocks those machines down.\n\n204\n00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:06.340\nMeanwhile, I can have a different\nprofile for teachers.\n\n205\n00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:09.780\nSo when teachers log in they can do all\nthat stuff and we just break it down.\n\n206\n00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:11.230\nNow I don't want to put\nthat in my settings for\n\n207\n00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:14.500\neveryone group cuz that's one\npolicy that applies to everybody.\n\n208\n00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:16.600\nI need to split things off.\n\n209\n00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:19.560\nAnd splitting them off per\nusers is actually really easy.\n\n210\n00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:22.070\nFirst off, we create a group,\nwhich we did in the last episode.\n\n211\n00:10:22.070 --> 00:10:24.170\nSo we created a teachers and\na students group.\n\n212\n00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:28.390\nAnd now, inside of the profile manager,\nI've got my students and teachers,\n\n213\n00:10:28.390 --> 00:10:29.500\nthey show up right here.\n\n214\n00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:33.330\nAnd all I have to do is choose them, oops,\nforgot to save my settings a minute ago.\n\n215\n00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:37.440\nAll we have to do is choose them, and now\nwe're editing the profile just for them.\n\n216\n00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:41.070\nSee how when I choose Everyone,\nI see General and Passcode?\n\n217\n00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:43.860\nBut if I choose Teachers,\nI only see General again.\n\n218\n00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:46.350\nAnd that's because there's no\nsettings inside of this one yet.\n\n219\n00:10:46.350 --> 00:10:48.260\nI need to go in and customize that.\n\n220\n00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:50.090\nSo let's say I wanna lock down Students.\n\n221\n00:10:50.090 --> 00:10:51.090\nSo we're gonna lock them down.\n\n222\n00:10:51.090 --> 00:10:54.540\nI'll choose the Students, and\nover here I'm gonna take my Settings, and\n\n223\n00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:56.290\nI'll just edit the General setting.\n\n224\n00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:00.130\nAnd inside of the general settings\nI'll start going through and\n\n225\n00:11:00.130 --> 00:11:02.950\nfinding all the different\nthings that I wanna restrict.\n\n226\n00:11:02.950 --> 00:11:04.970\nSo for example, let's see.\n\n227\n00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:09.160\nWhat do I wanna tweak here?\n\n228\n00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:10.910\nWell, let's say it's OS 10, right.\n\n229\n00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:13.740\nSo these are desktops and I don't want\nthem to get into system preferences.\n\n230\n00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:16.790\nSo I can jump down to the OS 10 section.\n\n231\n00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:21.770\nAnd I can find, let's see, restrictions.\n\n232\n00:11:21.770 --> 00:11:22.650\nThere we go.\n\n233\n00:11:22.650 --> 00:11:24.470\nI'm going to find restrictions.\n\n234\n00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:27.050\nI'm just going to go into\nconfigure on that one.\n\n235\n00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:32.140\nNow we start to see a ton of stuff where\nstrict items and system preferences.\n\n236\n00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:34.000\nI can restrict them all.\n\n237\n00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.540\nOr I can turn on and off the different\noptions that I want them to have,\n\n238\n00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:40.990\ncuz I might want to allow them to get\nto certain things, but not to others.\n\n239\n00:11:40.990 --> 00:11:44.010\nSo I might say restrict items\nin system preferences, and\n\n240\n00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:47.550\nI want to enable just the selected ones.\n\n241\n00:11:47.550 --> 00:11:49.120\nSo I'm gonna hit select none.\n\n242\n00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:51.580\nAnd now I can go through and\npick what I want them to get.\n\n243\n00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:54.520\nSo maybe I want them to be able\nto get to Accessibility, right?\n\n244\n00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:56.930\nIf I have a student\nwho's got disabilities,\n\n245\n00:11:56.930 --> 00:11:58.940\nI want them to be able to get in and\nconfigure that.\n\n246\n00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:02.520\nBut I don't want them to go into App Store\nor Software Update, Bluetooth, right,\n\n247\n00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:04.920\nthose are the things that I\ndon't want them to mess with.\n\n248\n00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:07.930\nScreensaver, Display, Doc, Energy Saver.\n\n249\n00:12:07.930 --> 00:12:10.790\nWhat else is something I\nmight want them to mess with?\n\n250\n00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:13.070\n&gt;&gt; I mean, the mouse?\n\n251\n00:12:13.070 --> 00:12:14.460\n&gt;&gt; Honestly, maybe mouse.\n\n252\n00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:16.770\nWe could turn on mouse and maybe sound.\n\n253\n00:12:16.770 --> 00:12:19.910\nOr we want them to adjust volume I\nsuppose or choose and output device.\n\n254\n00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:22.900\nSwitch between headphones and\ninternal speakers.\n\n255\n00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:24.790\nSo we just pick a couple\nof things like that.\n\n256\n00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:27.890\nJust the things that we want\nthem to have access to.\n\n257\n00:12:27.890 --> 00:12:30.730\nEverything else is going to be restricted.\n\n258\n00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:32.070\nAnd then up top, I can keep going.\n\n259\n00:12:32.070 --> 00:12:33.680\nI can go under apps.\n\n260\n00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:36.090\nAnd here I can pick\nwhat I want them to do.\n\n261\n00:12:36.090 --> 00:12:39.510\nAllow use of Game Center, well,\nno, not for students in school.\n\n262\n00:12:39.510 --> 00:12:41.980\nThey need to be doing their work,\nI'm gonna turn that off.\n\n263\n00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:46.250\nAllow App Store app adoption,\nallow Safari Autofill, and so on.\n\n264\n00:12:46.250 --> 00:12:49.260\nWe start to pick and\nchoose what behaviors we want for\n\n265\n00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:53.480\nthem require admin password to install or\nupdate apps.\n\n266\n00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:54.940\nThat's probably a good one.\n\n267\n00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:59.180\nIt's just whatever it is that we need and\nto really tighten down that environment.\n\n268\n00:12:59.180 --> 00:13:01.870\nYou've got the same thing with widgets,\nmedia.\n\n269\n00:13:01.870 --> 00:13:04.320\nWhether we want to allow them\nto do things like air drop.\n\n270\n00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:06.769\nWe probably don't want them to use\nair drop to move files around.\n\n271\n00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:10.520\nExternal discs you might\nnot want to allow.\n\n272\n00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:13.610\nIf somebody brings in a disc with\nmalware on it and plugs it in,\n\n273\n00:13:13.610 --> 00:13:16.080\nyou might not want that, so\nI might turn that off entirely.\n\n274\n00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:18.420\nYou can't use the CD drive or USB keys.\n\n275\n00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:21.960\nDisc images, we usually see those for\ninstalling software, so\n\n276\n00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:23.750\nmaybe I don't want to allow that.\n\n277\n00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:25.800\nDVD, we'll turn that off.\n\n278\n00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:28.590\nWhat else, a disk media access,\nI'm just gonna turn all of those off.\n\n279\n00:13:28.590 --> 00:13:30.650\nWhoops, I'm gonna try to, at least.\n\n280\n00:13:30.650 --> 00:13:31.630\nThere we go.\n\n281\n00:13:31.630 --> 00:13:35.460\nSo, really tightening up those\nrestrictions here on the students.\n\n282\n00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:38.500\nSame thing with sharing, what do you\nwant to be available and what don't you?\n\n283\n00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:41.140\nWe can just go right through and\nturn all of these off.\n\n284\n00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:43.340\nHey, I don't want them to share anything,\nright?\n\n285\n00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:48.030\nSo, just getting more and more restrictive\non these to limit what they can do.\n\n286\n00:13:48.030 --> 00:13:49.530\nAnd then last I got functionality here.\n\n287\n00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:53.110\nI'm gonna lock the desktop picture cuz I\ndon't want them changing that desktop.\n\n288\n00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:57.110\nI can hard code a picture path I might\nhave a company logo I wanna put.\n\n289\n00:13:57.110 --> 00:14:00.980\nAllow use of the camera we might allow\nthat I'm gonna turn off iCloud and\n\n290\n00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:02.470\nspotlight suggestions there we go.\n\n291\n00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:06.110\nSo we'll just kind of get that\ntightened up exactly the way we want.\n\n292\n00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:08.200\nSo we're building a policy\nthat's pretty restrictive and\n\n293\n00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:11.330\nI'm doing it all right here inside\nof the restrictions Object, but\n\n294\n00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:13.560\nthere's a lot of other\nstuff that we can tweak.\n\n295\n00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:16.700\nYou'll see things like login items and\nmobility, the doc.\n\n296\n00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:21.300\nDo we want the doc to auto-hide or\ndo we want it to always be visible, right?\n\n297\n00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:23.520\nWe can jump in and\nstart to configure that.\n\n298\n00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:26.200\nIf you ever get board,\njust browse through the profile.\n\n299\n00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:28.970\nI mean, you'll see there's\nhundreds of settings in there\n\n300\n00:14:28.970 --> 00:14:31.060\nthat can do all sorts of stuff.\n\n301\n00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:34.310\nMaybe I wanna have some\nmagnification on the doc.\n\n302\n00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:36.120\nI want it at the bottom.\n\n303\n00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:41.060\nWe'll do the genie effect, and\nautomatically hide and show the doc.\n\n304\n00:14:41.060 --> 00:14:41.790\nThat's not a default.\n\n305\n00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:43.550\nBy default, the doc is always up.\n\n306\n00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:47.170\nSo if I look at this client,\nthe doc is always up.\n\n307\n00:14:47.170 --> 00:14:49.759\nAnd when I move my mouse over those icons,\nsee how they don't change?\n\n308\n00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:52.930\nThey're always there, okay?\n\n309\n00:14:52.930 --> 00:14:57.110\nBut in my profile here, I'm saying\nturn on the magnification effect and\n\n310\n00:14:57.110 --> 00:14:58.870\nautomatically hide the dock, right?\n\n311\n00:14:58.870 --> 00:15:02.160\nSo we're changing some things to\nmake it behave a little different.\n\n312\n00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:05.740\nYou can even set the apps that\nwill appear in the user's dock.\n\n313\n00:15:05.740 --> 00:15:07.760\nCuz there's a ton of\napps in there by default.\n\n314\n00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:10.040\nI might wanna come in and change that.\n\n315\n00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:10.900\nAnd so I can come in and\n\n316\n00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:15.230\nstart to customize it, and pick\nthe apps that I wanna see in that doc.\n\n317\n00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:18.910\nWe may wanna really limit it,\nso that they only see\n\n318\n00:15:18.910 --> 00:15:21.980\nstuff that we think they're actually\ngonna need or use, or whatever.\n\n319\n00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:25.707\nSo maybe we'll configure\nthat setting another day.\n\n320\n00:15:25.707 --> 00:15:27.620\n[LAUGH] So we can come in and\nput all those.\n\n321\n00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:30.890\nThere's just a ton of stuff in here.\n\n322\n00:15:30.890 --> 00:15:33.730\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\njust say okay on that one.\n\n323\n00:15:33.730 --> 00:15:34.410\nAnd get that set.\n\n324\n00:15:34.410 --> 00:15:36.960\nBut like I said, spend some time,\nbrowse through there.\n\n325\n00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:39.990\nThere's a ton of iOS settings for\niPads and iPhones.\n\n326\n00:15:39.990 --> 00:15:41.090\nThere's a ton of OS 10 settings and\n\n327\n00:15:41.090 --> 00:15:43.300\nthere's a ton of settings\nthat apply to both.\n\n328\n00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:48.860\nYou can customize just about\nevery behavior of OS 10 and iOS.\n\n329\n00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:52.464\nAll right, and so now notice how\nI've got my General settings,\n\n330\n00:15:52.464 --> 00:15:55.603\nI've got doc settings, and\nI've got restrictions for\n\n331\n00:15:55.603 --> 00:15:58.302\nOS X all configured as\npart of this one profile.\n\n332\n00:15:58.302 --> 00:16:01.422\nAnd I haven't even touched Apps and\nBooks, where we can start to tweak and\n\n333\n00:16:01.422 --> 00:16:01.986\npush those.\n\n334\n00:16:01.986 --> 00:16:05.935\nYou can actually deploy software using\nthe Profile Manager if you want.\n\n335\n00:16:05.935 --> 00:16:09.537\nBut most important, though,\nis the Members tab.\n\n336\n00:16:09.537 --> 00:16:10.245\nUnder Members,\n\n337\n00:16:10.245 --> 00:16:13.535\nI can see that I currently don't have\nany members inside the Students group.\n\n338\n00:16:13.535 --> 00:16:18.010\nSo it's gonna be hard for this policy\nto apply if nobody is in the group.\n\n339\n00:16:18.010 --> 00:16:20.930\nSo I probably need to take care of\nthat and put somebody in the group.\n\n340\n00:16:20.930 --> 00:16:22.500\nI'm gonna go ahead and save this.\n\n341\n00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:24.488\nAnd now I've got that profile written.\n\n342\n00:16:24.488 --> 00:16:26.710\nAnd we should be pretty well set to go.\n\n343\n00:16:26.710 --> 00:16:28.910\nI'm gonna take that account I created for\nWes in the last episode.\n\n344\n00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:29.930\nI'm gonna make Wes a student.\n\n345\n00:16:29.930 --> 00:16:33.033\nSo let me go back to my Server Manager,\nand back to Groups.\n\n346\n00:16:33.033 --> 00:16:35.080\nAnd I'm gonna take that Students group.\n\n347\n00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:41.030\nAnd in it, I'm gonna add Wes as a member.\n\n348\n00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:43.330\nThere we go, all right,\nso Wes is now a student.\n\n349\n00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:46.690\nStudent in the School of Life,\nthere we go.\n\n350\n00:16:46.690 --> 00:16:48.710\nSo I've got you in there, Wes.\n\n351\n00:16:48.710 --> 00:16:50.240\nNow, he is a student.\n\n352\n00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:52.162\nI've got a profile on the Students group.\n\n353\n00:16:52.162 --> 00:16:54.911\nSo it's going to apply to\nWes whenever he logs onto\n\n354\n00:16:54.911 --> 00:16:58.160\na machine that's managed\nby our Profile Manager.\n\n355\n00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:02.080\n&gt;&gt; Very good, now Don, I've noticed we've\nbeen really focusing in on the users.\n\n356\n00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:03.295\nYou've got the Everyone group.\n\n357\n00:17:03.295 --> 00:17:05.680\nYou've got the groups that you've created.\n\n358\n00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:07.320\nWell, how about our Macs?\n\n359\n00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:09.240\nHow about the devices themselves\nthat we're gonna use?\n\n360\n00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:11.270\nCan we configure them as well and\nis it different?\n\n361\n00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:13.338\n&gt;&gt; You can, and\nwe're missing a key step here.\n\n362\n00:17:13.338 --> 00:17:16.820\nWhich is I still don't have any Macs\nbeing managed by this Profile Manager.\n\n363\n00:17:16.820 --> 00:17:19.680\nThe moment you get them enrolled,\nthen they show up and\n\n364\n00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:20.645\nwe can put them in groups.\n\n365\n00:17:20.645 --> 00:17:25.080\nSo if I go into my Profile Manager\nright now, and I go to Device Groups.\n\n366\n00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:26.600\nI created two groups,\nDesktops and Laptops.\n\n367\n00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:28.520\nAnd they don't have any members either.\n\n368\n00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:30.180\nSee how it says No Members.\n\n369\n00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:34.190\nWell, if I go over here to Devices,\nI'm not managing any devices right now.\n\n370\n00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:35.283\nSo I can't put them into the groups.\n\n371\n00:17:35.283 --> 00:17:38.100\nI need to enroll my first device, okay?\n\n372\n00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:38.990\nSo let's do that.\n\n373\n00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:40.242\nLet's get a device enrolled.\n\n374\n00:17:40.242 --> 00:17:42.716\nI'm gonna jump over to\nthis client right here.\n\n375\n00:17:42.716 --> 00:17:44.900\nSo here's a client.\n\n376\n00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:48.230\nAnd I want this client to be\nmanaged by the Profile Manager.\n\n377\n00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:51.460\nSo to do that,\nwhat I need to do is just fire up Safari.\n\n378\n00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:54.784\nAnd I'm gonna browse to that server.\n\n379\n00:17:54.784 --> 00:17:58.413\nSo I'm gonna browse to\n\n380\n00:17:58.413 --> 00:18:06.056\nosx-server01.local/profilemanager.\n\n381\n00:18:06.056 --> 00:18:07.680\nSo I'm gonna browse that\nProfile Manager page.\n\n382\n00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:11.990\nNow, when I log in as an administrator,\nI got the administration pages.\n\n383\n00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:18.478\nBut when I log in as a user, so when I log\nin as Wes Bryan, and I choose to log in.\n\n384\n00:18:18.478 --> 00:18:21.692\nIt's gonna recognize that I'm\njust a regular old user and\n\n385\n00:18:21.692 --> 00:18:24.440\nnot like some kind of super administrator.\n\n386\n00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:27.150\nAnd so it's gonna take me to\nthe regular management portal.\n\n387\n00:18:27.150 --> 00:18:31.350\nAnd I say that, but I might not\nremember the password that I gave you.\n\n388\n00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:36.219\nLet's try that again, there we go.\n\n389\n00:18:36.219 --> 00:18:37.870\nSo once I log in,\nI see this screen right here.\n\n390\n00:18:37.870 --> 00:18:41.900\nThis is a far cry different\nfrom this screen, isn't it?\n\n391\n00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:43.499\nHere, I really just have\na couple of options.\n\n392\n00:18:43.499 --> 00:18:46.710\nBut the main option is\nto enroll my device.\n\n393\n00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:50.210\nNow notice how the enrollment button\nright there, we just click it and\n\n394\n00:18:50.210 --> 00:18:51.610\nit downloads a file.\n\n395\n00:18:51.610 --> 00:18:54.090\nThat file is the profile.\n\n396\n00:18:54.090 --> 00:18:56.380\nI didn't have to install\nit via the web page.\n\n397\n00:18:56.380 --> 00:18:58.537\nI could have taken that profile and\ncopied it to a USB key and\n\n398\n00:18:58.537 --> 00:19:00.000\nbrought it over here and installed it.\n\n399\n00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.150\nOr made it a part of my NetInstall image.\n\n400\n00:19:03.150 --> 00:19:05.990\nWe could have it already done,\nbut this way, it's quicker.\n\n401\n00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:10.600\nSo it's downloading, and here it's asking,\ndo I want to install Remote Management?\n\n402\n00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:13.510\nAnd look what it's installing,\ntwo certificates.\n\n403\n00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:16.820\nIt's gotta trust the certificates that\nare coming from that Profile Manager.\n\n404\n00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:19.920\nSo when I continue that,\nit's gonna recognize it.\n\n405\n00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:23.740\nI'm gonna install it and I've got to\nbe an administrator to install it.\n\n406\n00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:26.800\nSo I've got a local account\nas administrator on this one,\n\n407\n00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:28.590\nat least I think I do.\n\n408\n00:19:28.590 --> 00:19:31.630\nSo we'll say OK to that, and\nnow it's gonna install that.\n\n409\n00:19:31.630 --> 00:19:35.000\nAnd what's happening is,\nI'm gonna trust those certificates.\n\n410\n00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.190\nI'm gonna enable Remote Management.\n\n411\n00:19:37.190 --> 00:19:40.320\nAnd now,\nI'm connected to the Profile Manager.\n\n412\n00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:42.690\nI'm connected and\nit's managing my identity.\n\n413\n00:19:43.950 --> 00:19:47.720\nNow Wes was already logged in\nwhen I connected up and did this.\n\n414\n00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:49.790\nAnd as I start to look at it,\nlook at some of these rights.\n\n415\n00:19:49.790 --> 00:19:53.170\nErase all data on this computer,\nchange settings, lock the screen.\n\n416\n00:19:53.170 --> 00:19:55.720\nThese are all things that\nthe Profile Manager can do.\n\n417\n00:19:55.720 --> 00:20:00.021\nThese have been applied,\nand now we're up and going.\n\n418\n00:20:00.021 --> 00:20:04.380\nNow just to make sure all my settings\napply, I'm gonna log out real quick.\n\n419\n00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:05.573\nSo we're gonna log out Wes Bryan.\n\n420\n00:20:05.573 --> 00:20:08.490\nAnd then I'm just gonna log him back in.\n\n421\n00:20:08.490 --> 00:20:11.390\nThere are some settings that don't\nactually take effect until you log out and\n\n422\n00:20:11.390 --> 00:20:12.000\nlog back in.\n\n423\n00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:13.230\nSome things take a moment.\n\n424\n00:20:13.230 --> 00:20:16.084\nSome settings require a reboot of\nthe computer before they take effect.\n\n425\n00:20:16.084 --> 00:20:18.240\nSo you always have to be aware of that.\n\n426\n00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:20.950\nBut for the most part, that should do.\n\n427\n00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:25.305\nNow, while we're waiting on that,\nback here in the Profile Manager,\n\n428\n00:20:25.305 --> 00:20:27.547\nlooking under Devices,\nlook what we've got.\n\n429\n00:20:27.547 --> 00:20:30.410\nDon's Mac,\nthat's the name of that other machine,\n\n430\n00:20:30.410 --> 00:20:34.360\nI didn't give it a very creative name,\nis logged in by Wes Bryan.\n\n431\n00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:36.450\nSo, Wes, you're logged into\nthis machine right here.\n\n432\n00:20:36.450 --> 00:20:37.999\nIt now shows up in my Devices.\n\n433\n00:20:37.999 --> 00:20:43.710\nAnd I can take that and\nI can put it in one of the device groups.\n\n434\n00:20:43.710 --> 00:20:46.259\nSo this Device Groups,\nif I take the Laptops device group, and\n\n435\n00:20:46.259 --> 00:20:49.380\nI go over here to the Members,\nthere's nobody in the Members.\n\n436\n00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:53.391\nBut unlike the User Groups, Device\nGroups I can add somebody right here.\n\n437\n00:20:53.391 --> 00:20:55.850\nAnd so I can add a device.\n\n438\n00:20:55.850 --> 00:20:57.930\nAnd I'm gonna add in Don's Mac.\n\n439\n00:20:57.930 --> 00:21:02.430\nSo there it is, and now Don's Mac\nis a part of the Laptops group.\n\n440\n00:21:02.430 --> 00:21:06.640\nAnd so any policies I write here on\nthe Laptops group will apply to Don's Mac.\n\n441\n00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:10.570\nSo I might go under Settings, and\nlet's say I wanna do power management.\n\n442\n00:21:10.570 --> 00:21:15.030\nI can edit the settings, and we can go in\nhere and we can find the energy saver.\n\n443\n00:21:15.030 --> 00:21:18.250\nAnd let me just make sure I'm\nin the OS 10 section, I am.\n\n444\n00:21:18.250 --> 00:21:21.430\nAnd I figured out, you have power\nmanagement on the iPhone and\n\n445\n00:21:21.430 --> 00:21:22.420\niOS devices also.\n\n446\n00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:25.730\nSo I'm gonna say put the computer\nto sleep after 30 minutes.\n\n447\n00:21:25.730 --> 00:21:27.940\nPut the display to sleep after 10 minutes.\n\n448\n00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:29.272\nWe don't wanna be too annoying.\n\n449\n00:21:29.272 --> 00:21:33.397\nSo I set the policy the way that\nI want it, and I'll say OK.\n\n450\n00:21:33.397 --> 00:21:36.280\nAnd now, I've got some energy saver\nsettings that are going to be applied\n\n451\n00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:36.800\nto Laptops.\n\n452\n00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:40.690\nThat's tied to the base computer.\n\n453\n00:21:40.690 --> 00:21:44.530\nWe've got the Students policy that's\napplied to Wes's user account.\n\n454\n00:21:44.530 --> 00:21:46.050\nAnd the two are gonna merge together.\n\n455\n00:21:46.050 --> 00:21:47.150\nThe computer policy and\n\n456\n00:21:47.150 --> 00:21:52.450\nthe user policy will combine to\ncreate a super mega amazing policy.\n\n457\n00:21:52.450 --> 00:21:57.600\nAnd the trick here is, once I apply it,\nwell, when does it take effect?\n\n458\n00:21:57.600 --> 00:21:59.190\nIt can actually take a little while.\n\n459\n00:21:59.190 --> 00:22:04.490\nWhat happens is,\nsee how it says Push Settings Laptop?\n\n460\n00:22:04.490 --> 00:22:07.891\n1 succeeded 3/14/16, so\nMarch 14, 2016 at 2:08 PM.\n\n461\n00:22:07.891 --> 00:22:09.250\nI just did a push to Apple.\n\n462\n00:22:11.070 --> 00:22:12.690\nI told Apple, hey,\nI wrote this new policy.\n\n463\n00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:15.260\nNow it's up to the clients to check in.\n\n464\n00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:18.367\nAnd at some point, the clients are gonna\ncheck in and say, look, a new policy,\n\n465\n00:22:18.367 --> 00:22:19.540\nI need to get it.\n\n466\n00:22:19.540 --> 00:22:22.330\nAnd they're gonna get it,\nall relays through Apple.\n\n467\n00:22:22.330 --> 00:22:24.920\nThese are push notifications\nthat'll come out.\n\n468\n00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:27.790\n&gt;&gt; Don, with the multiple policies and\na potential for\n\n469\n00:22:27.790 --> 00:22:32.910\nsomebody to be in a user location, versus\na user group, versus a device group here.\n\n470\n00:22:32.910 --> 00:22:34.864\nIs there a potential for\na policy conflict?\n\n471\n00:22:34.864 --> 00:22:36.472\nCould you have conflicting settings?\n\n472\n00:22:36.472 --> 00:22:38.110\nAnd if so, how are they resolved?\n\n473\n00:22:38.110 --> 00:22:41.050\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so you absolutely can\nhave conflicts, it does happen.\n\n474\n00:22:41.050 --> 00:22:44.632\nThe device settings apply first, and\nthen the user settings apply afterwards.\n\n475\n00:22:44.632 --> 00:22:45.989\nAnd so, for the most part,\n\n476\n00:22:45.989 --> 00:22:49.480\nuser settings can override those\ndevice settings on a per user basis.\n\n477\n00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:51.450\nSo you can have conflicts like that.\n\n478\n00:22:51.450 --> 00:22:53.970\nIt's up to you to really manage that and\nmake sure it doesn't happen.\n\n479\n00:22:53.970 --> 00:22:55.080\nIt's a difficult thing to track.\n\n480\n00:22:56.390 --> 00:22:58.950\nSo at this point I've got\na couple of devices written up.\n\n481\n00:22:58.950 --> 00:23:02.390\nI shouldn't have any active tasks\nat this point, and I don't.\n\n482\n00:23:02.390 --> 00:23:03.430\nAnd so it looks good.\n\n483\n00:23:03.430 --> 00:23:04.860\nWe've pushed out to Apple.\n\n484\n00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:07.040\nAnd now it's up for\nour clients to check in.\n\n485\n00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:08.180\nNow on our clients,\n\n486\n00:23:08.180 --> 00:23:12.083\nI actually know that at least one\nof the policies is already applied.\n\n487\n00:23:12.083 --> 00:23:16.240\nCuz I'm logged in as Wes and I don't see\nmy dock at the bottom of the screen.\n\n488\n00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:20.130\nAnd if I move my mouse down,\nthere it is, it was auto hidden.\n\n489\n00:23:20.130 --> 00:23:22.766\nAlthough it looks like my\nmagnification is not quite working.\n\n490\n00:23:22.766 --> 00:23:26.650\nSo part of it is there, so [LAUGH] anyhow.\n\n491\n00:23:26.650 --> 00:23:29.045\nSo there's that bar and\nit is actually auto hiding.\n\n492\n00:23:29.045 --> 00:23:30.790\nSo at least that part is working.\n\n493\n00:23:30.790 --> 00:23:34.965\nIf I go into my System Preferences,\nlook at my System Preferences.\n\n494\n00:23:34.965 --> 00:23:37.946\nNow I see all the icons, but do you\nsee how most of them are grayed out?\n\n495\n00:23:37.946 --> 00:23:42.880\nI can't run them, I don't know if you\nguys can hear me clicking feverishly.\n\n496\n00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:44.530\nI can't run these things.\n\n497\n00:23:44.530 --> 00:23:48.150\nI can run Mouse and\nSound and Accessibility.\n\n498\n00:23:48.150 --> 00:23:51.340\nThe ones that we enabled in the policy,\nI can run those.\n\n499\n00:23:51.340 --> 00:23:53.750\nI can't run any of those,\nthey've all been locked out.\n\n500\n00:23:53.750 --> 00:23:57.090\nSo that's that profile\napplying to this machine.\n\n501\n00:23:57.090 --> 00:24:00.616\nAnd so now we've stopped it where\nif a student wants to come in and\n\n502\n00:24:00.616 --> 00:24:04.404\nchange the desktop background Well,\nthey can try all they want, but\n\n503\n00:24:04.404 --> 00:24:06.125\nit's not gonna work, right?\n\n504\n00:24:06.125 --> 00:24:09.588\nThey can't get in to that System\nPreference and they can't change it.\n\n505\n00:24:09.588 --> 00:24:11.080\nNow the background's locked down, right?\n\n506\n00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:13.094\nThese are the types of things\nwe might want to apply.\n\n507\n00:24:13.094 --> 00:24:16.639\nAnd the password, I guess if we\nwanted to do a really long show, Wes,\n\n508\n00:24:16.639 --> 00:24:19.533\nwe could wait 90 days,\nthat would be a big recording.\n\n509\n00:24:19.533 --> 00:24:22.606\nBut we could wait 90 days, and\nwhen our password to reset, right?\n\n510\n00:24:22.606 --> 00:24:25.565\nAnd we'll have to go and change it.\n\n511\n00:24:25.565 --> 00:24:27.905\nBut you guys see the profile\nis actually working.\n\n512\n00:24:27.905 --> 00:24:31.294\nAnd the cool part is,\nif the student or teacher or\n\n513\n00:24:31.294 --> 00:24:33.863\nwhoever were to lose their machine.\n\n514\n00:24:33.863 --> 00:24:38.834\nThey could browse to the Profile Manager\nserver and they could log in,\n\n515\n00:24:38.834 --> 00:24:42.972\nand when they log in they're\ngonna see their own devices.\n\n516\n00:24:42.972 --> 00:24:45.170\nThey're gonna see the devices\nthat they're managing.\n\n517\n00:24:45.170 --> 00:24:49.909\nSo when I log in as Wes here,\nI say when I log in,\n\n518\n00:24:49.909 --> 00:24:53.933\nthere we go, he sees this Mac, right?\n\n519\n00:24:53.933 --> 00:24:58.974\nThat's the Mac that I'm on right now,\nand he can lock it, and he can wipe it.\n\n520\n00:24:58.974 --> 00:25:00.419\nSo if he loses the laptop, right?\n\n521\n00:25:00.419 --> 00:25:01.789\nAt a minimum, he can lock it real quick.\n\n522\n00:25:01.789 --> 00:25:03.562\nLet me lock that thing, right?\n\n523\n00:25:03.562 --> 00:25:07.064\nBut if he knows it's gone,\nhe can wipe it and do a remote wipe, and\n\n524\n00:25:07.064 --> 00:25:08.745\nI'll flush that machine out.\n\n525\n00:25:08.745 --> 00:25:10.216\nAnd I'm doing it here from a laptop, but\n\n526\n00:25:10.216 --> 00:25:11.829\nyou can do it from any\ncomputer in the world.\n\n527\n00:25:11.829 --> 00:25:15.438\nYou can fire open and\nbrowse through the server and log in.\n\n528\n00:25:15.438 --> 00:25:17.873\nAnd remote wipe or remote lock it, right?\n\n529\n00:25:17.873 --> 00:25:20.073\nAnd if I were to lock it,\nlet me just hit that.\n\n530\n00:25:20.073 --> 00:25:23.489\nI'm gonna lock it, and\nI'll put in a passcode to use.\n\n531\n00:25:23.489 --> 00:25:25.934\nActually, I guess I'll\njust use his password.\n\n532\n00:25:25.934 --> 00:25:28.456\nSo we'll punch that in, and we'll lock it.\n\n533\n00:25:28.456 --> 00:25:32.841\nAnd it's gonna send,\nit's gotta be a six digit number?\n\n534\n00:25:32.841 --> 00:25:34.942\nBet you can't guess what\nsix digit number I'm using.\n\n535\n00:25:34.942 --> 00:25:37.588\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's the same password as my\n\n536\n00:25:37.588 --> 00:25:38.502\nluggage, all right.\n\n537\n00:25:38.502 --> 00:25:40.263\nSo I'm gonna send that lock, there we go.\n\n538\n00:25:40.263 --> 00:25:41.329\nSo they're saying are you sure?\n\n539\n00:25:41.329 --> 00:25:45.920\nI'm gonna say, okay, and what's happening\nis I'm sending a lock message up to Apple.\n\n540\n00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:49.064\nAnd then Apple is pushing a lock\nmessage down to this Mac.\n\n541\n00:25:49.064 --> 00:25:55.257\nAnd at some point in the next few moments,\nwhat I expect to see is the system lock.\n\n542\n00:25:55.257 --> 00:25:57.891\nAnd in fact, there it goes.\n\n543\n00:25:57.891 --> 00:26:01.079\nI was about to say, my mouse already\nstopped working, and there it goes.\n\n544\n00:26:01.079 --> 00:26:04.663\nThis is a virtual machine, so it just\nkicked me out, and now it's rebooting.\n\n545\n00:26:04.663 --> 00:26:07.015\nAnd the machine is effectively locked,\nright?\n\n546\n00:26:07.015 --> 00:26:11.539\nSo that's a really cool thing that you can\ndo remotely even after you've lost that\n\n547\n00:26:11.539 --> 00:26:12.140\nmachine.\n\n548\n00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:13.554\nPretty neat stuff.\n\n549\n00:26:13.554 --> 00:26:17.775\nAnother thing I wanna point out is the\ndevice, we had to add that device, right?\n\n550\n00:26:17.775 --> 00:26:19.678\nSo we wouldn't hear under devices.\n\n551\n00:26:19.678 --> 00:26:23.051\nWe had to register it, and\nthen after it was registered,\n\n552\n00:26:23.051 --> 00:26:25.664\nI had to put it in the Laptops group,\nright?\n\n553\n00:26:25.664 --> 00:26:29.169\nBut for a brief while, it was registered,\nand it wasn't in the Laptops group,\n\n554\n00:26:29.169 --> 00:26:31.170\nso it didn't have that\npolicy applied to it.\n\n555\n00:26:31.170 --> 00:26:34.151\nIf you know that you're about\nto get a bunch of laptops,\n\n556\n00:26:34.151 --> 00:26:36.254\nyou can actually preseed them in here.\n\n557\n00:26:36.254 --> 00:26:39.459\nThis goes back to the enrollment\nprogram that Apple has or\n\n558\n00:26:39.459 --> 00:26:42.230\nthe volume purchase agreements.\n\n559\n00:26:42.230 --> 00:26:45.795\nThey'll actually send you a big list\nof serial numbers when you buy 20 or\n\n560\n00:26:45.795 --> 00:26:47.935\n1,000 or 100 laptops or whatever.\n\n561\n00:26:47.935 --> 00:26:50.559\nThey'll send you the serial numbers and\nyou can just come in here and\n\n562\n00:26:50.559 --> 00:26:51.489\nyou can add the device.\n\n563\n00:26:51.489 --> 00:26:57.078\nSo here under Devices, if I hit the little\nplus sign, I can add a Placeholder.\n\n564\n00:26:57.078 --> 00:27:00.215\nImport Placeholders, if you're in\nthe volume purchase agreement,\n\n565\n00:27:00.215 --> 00:27:03.469\nthey'll send you a file and you just\nimport it right in and you're done.\n\n566\n00:27:03.469 --> 00:27:06.443\nBut if you do it by hand,\nyou can choose Add Placeholder and\n\n567\n00:27:06.443 --> 00:27:08.398\nit will create a placeholder device.\n\n568\n00:27:08.398 --> 00:27:12.750\nSo I can tell it, hey, this is going to\nbe a, maybe it's a Macbook Pro, right?\n\n569\n00:27:12.750 --> 00:27:18.270\nSo I might call this Wes Bryan's Laptop,\nright?\n\n570\n00:27:18.270 --> 00:27:21.310\nAnd then you need to put\nin the serial number, so\n\n571\n00:27:21.310 --> 00:27:25.750\nyou will put in whatever that\nserial number happens to be, right?\n\n572\n00:27:25.750 --> 00:27:28.652\nAnd this is important because\nwhen I add that place holder,\n\n573\n00:27:28.652 --> 00:27:30.170\nit's gonna add it to the list.\n\n574\n00:27:30.170 --> 00:27:34.505\nSo here is the Wes' new laptop,\nand I can take that laptop and\n\n575\n00:27:34.505 --> 00:27:37.320\nI can put it in the other device groups.\n\n576\n00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:42.567\nSo I can go under the Device groups and\nLaptops, and go in the Members.\n\n577\n00:27:42.567 --> 00:27:46.933\nAnd I can add his new laptop\nto the Laptops group.\n\n578\n00:27:46.933 --> 00:27:49.957\nAnd by doing that,\nwhen we actually get the real laptop,\n\n579\n00:27:49.957 --> 00:27:52.351\nwhen it shows up in our hands and\nwe enroll it,\n\n580\n00:27:52.351 --> 00:27:56.075\nit'll automatically be in the laptops\ngroup from moment number one.\n\n581\n00:27:56.075 --> 00:27:57.469\nIt'll always have them restrictions.\n\n582\n00:27:57.469 --> 00:27:59.716\nYou don't wanna give a laptop\nto a student, and for\n\n583\n00:27:59.716 --> 00:28:02.338\na brief while they have\nunrestricted access to it, right?\n\n584\n00:28:02.338 --> 00:28:03.953\nYou want it to be restricted\nfrom the very beginning, right?\n\n585\n00:28:03.953 --> 00:28:04.738\nFrom enrollment.\n\n586\n00:28:04.738 --> 00:28:07.731\nAnd so by doing this, by preseeding.\n\n587\n00:28:07.731 --> 00:28:11.540\nThey call it seeding,\nS-E-E-D, seeding the device.\n\n588\n00:28:11.540 --> 00:28:14.960\nWe put it in here, it's early provisioned,\nand it's just ready to rock.\n\n589\n00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:16.720\nSo kind of a neat function there.\n\n590\n00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:20.563\n&gt;&gt; Great, in this episode, we've been\nlooking at our Profile Manager, and\n\n591\n00:28:20.563 --> 00:28:22.761\na lot of good information in this episode.\n\n592\n00:28:22.761 --> 00:28:24.780\nDon, you have anything else for\nus on this one?\n\n593\n00:28:24.780 --> 00:28:27.500\n&gt;&gt; The only other thing is,\nif you're not gonna have a device anymore,\n\n594\n00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:31.130\nif you get rid of a device, you can\nremove them from the Profile Manager.\n\n595\n00:28:31.130 --> 00:28:34.399\nWhen you remove them, you can just go in.\n\n596\n00:28:34.399 --> 00:28:36.229\nHere, let me just show you real quick.\n\n597\n00:28:36.229 --> 00:28:38.827\nSo let's say that we don't\nhave Don's Mac anymore.\n\n598\n00:28:38.827 --> 00:28:40.336\nSo you can go into these devices and\n\n599\n00:28:40.336 --> 00:28:44.040\nyou can just hit the little minus button\ndown here at the bottom to remove it.\n\n600\n00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:46.590\nNow when you remove it,\nit's got two choices.\n\n601\n00:28:46.590 --> 00:28:50.100\nOne to revert it to a placeholder, which\nmeans we keep all the policy settings, but\n\n602\n00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:52.190\nthe device is now no\nlonger being spoken to.\n\n603\n00:28:52.190 --> 00:28:55.690\nOr we can Unenroll where we\ncompletely disconnect the device.\n\n604\n00:28:55.690 --> 00:28:58.645\nAnd so that's what I'm gonna choose there,\nand we'll unenroll it and\n\n605\n00:28:58.645 --> 00:28:59.884\nit's gonna come out, okay?\n\n606\n00:28:59.884 --> 00:29:03.456\nNow when that happens,\nwhat happens to the device?\n\n607\n00:29:03.456 --> 00:29:04.930\nWell it's not managed anymore.\n\n608\n00:29:04.930 --> 00:29:08.320\nSo it's got all these settings on it,\nbut now the user can over ride them.\n\n609\n00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:11.282\nThey can go in and change things,\nthey can go in and manipulate that.\n\n610\n00:29:11.282 --> 00:29:14.695\nSo that's unenrolling or\ngetting the device kind of chucked out.\n\n611\n00:29:14.695 --> 00:29:18.386\nAnd you'll see that mine's got this\nlittle kinda dashed circle thing.\n\n612\n00:29:18.386 --> 00:29:21.713\nIt'll stay like that for a little while,\ncuz we're talking to the other device.\n\n613\n00:29:21.713 --> 00:29:25.079\nAnd it's only once we get full\nconfirmation that it actually comes out of\n\n614\n00:29:25.079 --> 00:29:27.957\nthere, and it can take a little\nbit of time for that to happen.\n\n615\n00:29:27.957 --> 00:29:30.985\n&gt;&gt; Great information Don here,\nbut I gotta go columbo on you.\n\n616\n00:29:30.985 --> 00:29:33.914\nBecause just one more thing you\ndid mention that lock screen,\n\n617\n00:29:33.914 --> 00:29:35.786\nare we gonna get a chance to see that?\n\n618\n00:29:35.786 --> 00:29:39.452\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I didn't show it cuz the machine\nhas to, it reboots and we saw that and\n\n619\n00:29:39.452 --> 00:29:40.500\nI kinda gave up on it.\n\n620\n00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:43.985\nBut after it reboots it boots up into kind\nof a almost like the recovery console in\n\n621\n00:29:43.985 --> 00:29:46.757\na way, it's a special console\nthat has that lock screen in it.\n\n622\n00:29:46.757 --> 00:29:48.990\nLet me just flip over to it, there we go.\n\n623\n00:29:48.990 --> 00:29:52.383\nSo if you had that device\nthat was locked out, right?\n\n624\n00:29:52.383 --> 00:29:56.318\nThat it had been remotely locked, you'd\nturn it on and this is all you'd get.\n\n625\n00:29:56.318 --> 00:29:58.949\nYou see there's not a whole lot\nof options to be found here.\n\n626\n00:29:58.949 --> 00:30:04.884\nYou've got Sleep, Restart, Shut Down,\nand then your six digit pin code.\n\n627\n00:30:04.884 --> 00:30:08.138\nSo once we recover this laptop,\nthen we can punch in the code.\n\n628\n00:30:08.138 --> 00:30:09.310\nWithout that code, you can't use it.\n\n629\n00:30:09.310 --> 00:30:13.400\nNow, a quick word of caution on that one,\nif you're not using File Vault,\n\n630\n00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:16.120\npeople can still boot in target mode and\nget at your data.\n\n631\n00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:18.899\nSo if you're using File Vault,\nyour drive's encrypted and\n\n632\n00:30:18.899 --> 00:30:19.940\nnow it really is safe.\n\n633\n00:30:19.940 --> 00:30:23.211\nYou don't have to worry about\nanybody getting in there,\n\n634\n00:30:23.211 --> 00:30:25.606\nunless they have your super secret code.\n\n635\n00:30:25.606 --> 00:30:27.622\nAnd you probably don't wanna\nuse the one that I used.\n\n636\n00:30:27.622 --> 00:30:30.759\nBut if they have the code, then they can\nunlock it, and it's gonna boot up and\n\n637\n00:30:30.759 --> 00:30:31.594\nyou'll be back in.\n\n638\n00:30:31.594 --> 00:30:35.084\nSo that's what that locked screen looks\nlike, and you can remote wipe anywhere\n\n639\n00:30:35.084 --> 00:30:38.436\nthat machine has a network connection,\nyou'll see it and lock the screen.\n\n640\n00:30:38.436 --> 00:30:39.094\n&gt;&gt; That's awesome.\n\n641\n00:30:39.094 --> 00:30:42.234\nWell, I'm gonna have to go and\nchange my passcode myself now.\n\n642\n00:30:42.234 --> 00:30:43.805\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna go ahead and\n\n643\n00:30:43.805 --> 00:30:45.027\nsign off here at ITPro.TV.\n\n644\n00:30:45.027 --> 00:30:46.546\nI've been your host Wes Bryan.\n\n645\n00:30:46.546 --> 00:30:47.303\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n646\n00:30:47.303 --> 00:30:49.210\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n647\n00:30:49.210 --> 00:30:55.880\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:16.346\nI'm your host Wes Bryan.\n\n4\n00:00:16.346 --> 00:00:20.120\nAnd in today's episode we're gonna be\nmoving through our Mac Management Basics.\n\n5\n00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:23.540\nAnd we got our in house Mac expert,\nnone other than Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n6\n00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:24.608\nDon, how you doing today, sir?\n\n7\n00:00:24.608 --> 00:00:25.595\n>> I'm doing great, Wes.\n\n8\n00:00:25.595 --> 00:00:28.331\nReady to jump right back into\nthe world of Mac Manager Basics, and\n\n9\n00:00:28.331 --> 00:00:31.717\nin this episode we're gonna take a look\nat something that's pretty important,\n\n10\n00:00:31.717 --> 00:00:33.280\nit's the software update service.\n\n11\n00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.340\nIt's a part of the server app in OS10 and\nit's been around a while,\n\n12\n00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.290\nbut it's right here in El Capitan, too,\nand it is extremely important, more so\n\n13\n00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:42.590\ntoday than even in the past.\n\n14\n00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.539\nBecause we are seeing a lot of security\nupdates getting pushed out and\n\n15\n00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:54.320\nthings happen, things happen where hackers\nfind a vulnerability inside of Mac OS and\n\n16\n00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.600\nthey start to exploit it, and\nApple recognizes that pretty quick and\n\n17\n00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.310\nas soon as they spot something like that,\nthey push out an update.\n\n18\n00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:04.540\nWell, if you've got one or five Macs,\n\n19\n00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.690\nyou can just go and manually update them,\nbut it is up to you to go and update them.\n\n20\n00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:13.220\nIf you have 1,000 Macs, how do you\nknow they're all getting updated?\n\n21\n00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.620\nWell the software update service lets us\ncontrol that and there's times when we\n\n22\n00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:21.140\nwanna get updates out as fast as possible\nand there's other times where we\n\n23\n00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.590\nmight wanna hold off and say,\nyou know what, my guys aren't ready for\n\n24\n00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.490\nthis particular update just yet,\nlet's hold off on that for a little while.\n\n25\n00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:33.900\nAnd so the software update service gives\nus that ability to control the updates and\n\n26\n00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.550\nput the ball in our court.\n\n27\n00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:37.960\nLet us control it, let us determine\nwhen the updates go out and\n\n28\n00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.090\nensure that they're getting out there and\nkeep our systems up to date.\n\n29\n00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.869\nAll right, so let's talk a little bit\nabout, well I definitely wanna talk about\n\n30\n00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.940\nthe software update service,\nthat's why I said all that stuff.\n\n31\n00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:50.935\nBut before we jump in and implement it,\n\n32\n00:01:50.935 --> 00:01:53.600\nI wanna talk about some of\nApple's best practices.\n\n33\n00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.140\nThere's some updates,\nlike critical security updates,\n\n34\n00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.420\nthat you need to get out\nas fast as possible.\n\n35\n00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.270\nSo, for example, just last week there\nwas a new ransomware that was out there,\n\n36\n00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.280\nit was called KeRanger and\n\n37\n00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.490\nit would encrypt your data on\na Mac if you got infected with it.\n\n38\n00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:14.560\nApple had an update put out within hours\nof detection of this ransomware, and\n\n39\n00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.220\nso they revoked a certificate to\ninvalidate the application that would run\n\n40\n00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.350\nto allow that virus or\nransomware to install.\n\n41\n00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.490\nWell when they revoke a certificate,\nthat's done on their end,\n\n42\n00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:27.680\nthat's on their servers, you actually\ndon't have to change your Macs at all.\n\n43\n00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.510\nAnd so that's a very quick thing that\nApple fixes on their servers and\n\n44\n00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.050\nyou don't even have an update.\n\n45\n00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.950\nSo there's sometimes where\nthe critical updates aren't\n\n46\n00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.610\nsomething we have to push out,\nit's already done for us.\n\n47\n00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.770\nThere's other times though, where there's\nmalicious applications that are out there\n\n48\n00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:47.090\nand Apple will push an update out to the\nGatekeeper software inside of your Mac,\n\n49\n00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:48.730\nand if you're not\nfamiliar with Gatekeeper,\n\n50\n00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.690\nit's one of those things that runs in\nthe background that we don't normally see.\n\n51\n00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.530\nSo for example,\nif I go on the internet and\n\n52\n00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:59.430\nI download a program, the first time I\nrun it, my Mac might say, hey, this is\n\n53\n00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.760\na program that was downloaded from the\ninternet, are you sure you wanna open it?\n\n54\n00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.840\nAnd I can say open it or\nnot, that's Gatekeeper.\n\n55\n00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.940\nGatekeeper doesn't allow\njust any old program to run\n\n56\n00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.320\nunless you authorize it first.\n\n57\n00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.690\nThat stops viruses running\nin the background.\n\n58\n00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.890\nWell occasionally hackers find\na way to get around that.\n\n59\n00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:17.740\nAnd so they push out a virus and\n\n60\n00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:20.090\nit starts running on your\nmachines without you knowing it.\n\n61\n00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.850\nApple will push an update out\nto GateKeeper to tell it to\n\n62\n00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:23.810\nwatch out for that.\n\n63\n00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.230\nAnd these are security updates that\nApple rolls out from time to time.\n\n64\n00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:31.030\nThose need to go out as soon as you can,\nvery, very fast.\n\n65\n00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.760\nGet them on your network,\n\n66\n00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.940\nget them deployed out to\nyour machines very quickly.\n\n67\n00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:37.190\nAnd so what a lot of people do is they\njust configure their Macs to update\n\n68\n00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:38.660\nautomatically.\n\n69\n00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:40.650\nLet me show you for example, here.\n\n70\n00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:41.850\nI've got a client,\n\n71\n00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:44.690\nactually, I can probably even\nshow you here on my own laptop.\n\n72\n00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:49.520\nSo here's my laptop and\nI'm running El Capitan and\n\n73\n00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:56.000\nif I go into my system preferences and\nI go into my app store, right\n\n74\n00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.850\nhere in the App store you'll see where it\nset to automatically check for updates.\n\n75\n00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:03.440\nAnd it's gonna download newly\navailable updates in the background,\n\n76\n00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:08.600\nit's gonna install them and it's doing\napp updates as well as OS X update.\n\n77\n00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:12.840\nSo I'm getting my operating system\nupdates and the apps from the app store.\n\n78\n00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.930\nNot apps that are outside the apps store,\nif I downloaded the app myself,\n\n79\n00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:19.490\nI've gotta update it myself, but\nones from the app store are gonna updated.\n\n80\n00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:22.790\nAnd then install system data files and\nsecurity updates.\n\n81\n00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:26.460\nSo it's set to check for\nthose and get them.\n\n82\n00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.410\nAnd then it says automatically download\napps that I purchased or whatever, right.\n\n83\n00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:31.930\nSo all of these things are set here to\nbe able to go and get those updates.\n\n84\n00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:36.170\nNow Here's the thing,\nhow often is it checking?\n\n85\n00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:38.780\nWell, there's actually some\nlittle variations out there, but\n\n86\n00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:43.350\nmost Macs are checking every four to seven\ndays, so it's not checking terrible often.\n\n87\n00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:45.540\nIt's not checking every\nsingle day by default.\n\n88\n00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:48.960\nAnd security updates can come out very\nquickly and we need to get them out there.\n\n89\n00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.660\nSo, just because a client\nis set to be checking for\n\n90\n00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:54.490\nupdates, doesn't mean\nit's doing it rapidly.\n\n91\n00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:58.760\nAnd, if you've got 1,000 Macs, how do\nyou know that these settings are proper?\n\n92\n00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:02.090\nWell, you can use things like Profile\nManager, and you could push these update\n\n93\n00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:06.320\nsettings out or you could bake it into\nyour net insult images that you push out.\n\n94\n00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:10.830\nYou could use Apple Remote Desktop\nto push out the configurations, but\n\n95\n00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:12.250\nthere's an easier way.\n\n96\n00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:16.960\nAnd the easier way is to set up your own\nsoftware update server and control it.\n\n97\n00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:18.700\nThe other thing is I just\ncheck those boxes there.\n\n98\n00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:20.260\nI said, do the updates.\n\n99\n00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.970\nBut that's gonna do the updates and\nI don't get to pick and choose.\n\n100\n00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:26.990\nI can turn that off and make it a manual\nprocess but now if I forget to do it,\n\n101\n00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:28.310\nI don't get updated.\n\n102\n00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:31.260\nBut there's times where updates\ncome out that I don't wanna do.\n\n103\n00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.700\nI know what you're thinking,\nwhen would I not want an update?\n\n104\n00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:34.950\nWell, for example,\n\n105\n00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:39.480\nwhen El Capitan first came out, it wasn't\nexactly a smooth ride for a lot of users.\n\n106\n00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:42.380\nThere was a lot of software that didn't\nplay nice with El Capitan when it\n\n107\n00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:43.330\nfirst came out.\n\n108\n00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:45.530\nSo you might be running Yosemite,\nand you say,\n\n109\n00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:48.580\nhey I don't wanna do that upgrade yet,\nI wanna wait.\n\n110\n00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:51.710\nWell, Apple doesn't like that and they're\ngonna keep bugging you to update and\n\n111\n00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:53.600\nupdate and update,\nyou keep getting that message.\n\n112\n00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:56.200\nWell if I've got 1,000 Macs\nthat are deployed out there,\n\n113\n00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:58.270\nI might not be ready for El Capitan yet.\n\n114\n00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:03.120\nAnd so if I have my own software update\nserver, I can take that update and\n\n115\n00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:04.530\nnot approve it.\n\n116\n00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:07.390\nI can approve all the other updates and\nleave that one out.\n\n117\n00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:11.060\nSo you can start to pick and choose, and\nthat's what a software update server does.\n\n118\n00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:14.830\nWe will have to have it, your clients can\nautomatically check on their own, but\n\n119\n00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:17.240\nhaving a software update\nserver gives us that control.\n\n120\n00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:19.670\nSo there's our first best\npractice in a corporate or\n\n121\n00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:23.360\nenterprise environment with a large amount\nof machines, take control of the updates.\n\n122\n00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:31.040\nThe second best practice is to set up a\ndeployment process, a deployment schedule.\n\n123\n00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:34.670\nWhen an update comes out,\nif it's a critical security update,\n\n124\n00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:37.000\nwe want it to go out as fast as possible.\n\n125\n00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.453\nBut when it's a big update\nlike a new operating system or\n\n126\n00:06:40.453 --> 00:06:45.096\neven the smaller updates,\nEl Capitan I think I'm on 10.11.3 now.\n\n127\n00:06:45.096 --> 00:06:49.495\nAnd 10.11.4 is in beta,\nI think they're on like 5th beta,\n\n128\n00:06:49.495 --> 00:06:54.985\nsome ridiculous amount of betas for it,\nbut 10.11.4 is gonna come out soon.\n\n129\n00:06:54.985 --> 00:06:57.423\nBy the time you watch this video\nit will probably already be out.\n\n130\n00:06:57.423 --> 00:07:00.195\nWhen it comes out,\nit's gonna fix some bugs, and\n\n131\n00:07:00.195 --> 00:07:02.870\nit's going to add some new features.\n\n132\n00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:06.370\nAnd those new features,\nthey could break software that I've got.\n\n133\n00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:07.410\nI've need to do some testing,\n\n134\n00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:11.150\nI might not wanna roll that out to\nmy entire environment on day one.\n\n135\n00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:14.500\nSo apple recommends\na three phase deployment.\n\n136\n00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:17.120\nPhase one, they call their cooldown.\n\n137\n00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:18.300\nIf an update comes out and\n\n138\n00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:23.490\nit's not a critical security update,\nthey recommend waiting seven days.\n\n139\n00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:25.360\nDon't roll it out today.\n\n140\n00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:26.500\nWe're gonna wait seven days,\n\n141\n00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:29.260\nwe're gonna wait one week before\nwe start to look at that update.\n\n142\n00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:30.930\nNow, why wait one week?\n\n143\n00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:33.080\nWell, if it's an application update or\n\n144\n00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:36.365\neven if it's an Apple update,\nsometimes there's bugs.\n\n145\n00:07:36.365 --> 00:07:39.740\nThis new update rolls out and\nbreaks something.\n\n146\n00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:43.910\nAnd if you updated to it right away,\nnow you gotta try to roll back the update.\n\n147\n00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:48.170\nAnd in Mac OS it's easy to do it,\niOS they don't allow you to roll back,\n\n148\n00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:50.095\nit's really hard to roll back.\n\n149\n00:07:50.095 --> 00:07:53.793\nSo, we wanna make sure that we're ready,\nso they recommended waiting a week,\n\n150\n00:07:53.793 --> 00:07:56.731\nnot for a critical security but\nif any other update wait a week.\n\n151\n00:07:56.731 --> 00:08:01.512\nAfter a week If the vendor hasn't had to\nissue any new updates to fix their update,\n\n152\n00:08:01.512 --> 00:08:06.450\nthen it's probably safe but even then, we\ndon't wanna roll up the update just yet.\n\n153\n00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:11.280\nPhase two is a test phase.\n\n154\n00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:15.140\nWhat we do is we have a small\nselection of computers.\n\n155\n00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:17.250\nI'm might have 1,000\nMacs on my network but\n\n156\n00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:20.090\nI pick ten computers to be my test bed.\n\n157\n00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:23.965\nThese are the people I'm gonna roll out\nto next, so we can test that update.\n\n158\n00:08:23.965 --> 00:08:27.210\n>> Don, a little bit about the demographic\nof the people that you might roll this out\n\n159\n00:08:27.210 --> 00:08:31.070\nto and other patch management systems,\na lot of times,\n\n160\n00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:34.270\nit's people like your tech savvy users,\nlike your IT.\n\n161\n00:08:34.270 --> 00:08:36.400\nMaybe not the top admins but at least,\n\n162\n00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:39.810\nsomebody that if you as an admin came to\nthem and said what are you seeing now,\n\n163\n00:08:39.810 --> 00:08:43.480\nthey wouldn't be saying things, the\nthingamajigger next to the doamahickey.\n\n164\n00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:46.150\nSomebody who knows a little\nbit about what's going on.\n\n165\n00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:47.450\nWould you do something like that?\n\n166\n00:08:47.450 --> 00:08:50.940\n>> Yeah, and you gotta be careful with who\nyou pick for this, for the test group.\n\n167\n00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:54.175\nI know a lot of companies, they say,\nwe'll use the IT department.\n\n168\n00:08:54.175 --> 00:08:56.165\nWe're gonna pick all of the IT\ndepartment computers to update\n\n169\n00:08:56.165 --> 00:08:57.375\ncuz they'll know what to do.\n\n170\n00:08:57.375 --> 00:09:02.515\nBut here's the thing, I used to work for\na bank, and at the bank, we had mortgage\n\n171\n00:09:02.515 --> 00:09:07.546\nsoftware and financial software, we had\nthe teller system, all these packages.\n\n172\n00:09:07.546 --> 00:09:10.893\nGuess how many time I ran\nthe mortgage software?\n\n173\n00:09:10.893 --> 00:09:11.520\nNot once.\n\n174\n00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:14.250\nThe entire time I worked at the bank\nI never once ran it because\n\n175\n00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:15.420\nI don't do mortgage.\n\n176\n00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:18.910\nI'm an IT guy, I support the computers,\nI don't do mortgages.\n\n177\n00:09:18.910 --> 00:09:20.140\nI'm not a teller,\n\n178\n00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:23.175\nI'm not gonna help you withdraw money\nfrom your account, I don't wanna do that.\n\n179\n00:09:23.175 --> 00:09:28.160\n[LAUGH] An IT guy isn't using the software\n\n180\n00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:33.030\nthat the regular end-users are.\n\n181\n00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:37.530\nLet's go with the bank example,\nyou need to pick a loan officer, a teller,\n\n182\n00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:41.680\na branch manager, people that are in\nfield working with your line of business\n\n183\n00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:44.550\napplications, they need to\nbe the ones you test with.\n\n184\n00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:47.335\nBut do what Wes said,\npick ones who are really more tech savvy,\n\n185\n00:09:47.335 --> 00:09:51.390\nones that are little more friendly that\ncan help you troubleshoot a problem.\n\n186\n00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:53.380\nIf you pick somebody who's clueless and\nthey have a problem,\n\n187\n00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:55.790\nthey're not gonna know,\nthey're gonna just complain.\n\n188\n00:09:55.790 --> 00:09:57.740\nBut if they're tech savvy,\nthen they can help to identify and\n\n189\n00:09:57.740 --> 00:10:01.180\nsay here's the steps that I was\ndoing when this crash occurred and\n\n190\n00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:03.870\nlet's see if it's that\nupdate that caused it.\n\n191\n00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:07.450\nYou pick a small sampling, a small group\nof people in your organization and\n\n192\n00:10:07.450 --> 00:10:09.000\nuse them as the test bed.\n\n193\n00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.200\nFor phase two,\nwe roll the update out to those people,\n\n194\n00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:16.300\nthey get the update and\nyou let them run for five days.\n\n195\n00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:19.520\nWe had seven days for the first phase,\nfive days for the second phase.\n\n196\n00:10:20.530 --> 00:10:21.600\nI'm not just making these numbers up,\n\n197\n00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:24.680\nthese are the official\nApple best practice.\n\n198\n00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:29.110\nNow after five days pass,\nwe know the first seven days went by,\n\n199\n00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:32.180\nthe vendor's okay with the update,\nthe next five days went by,\n\n200\n00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:34.650\nmy test group is okay with the update.\n\n201\n00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:38.660\nNow we're ready to roll out to everybody\nelse and we deploy the update through our\n\n202\n00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:42.050\nentire environment 12 days\nafter the update came out.\n\n203\n00:10:42.050 --> 00:10:43.920\nCritical security updates,\nroll them out right away.\n\n204\n00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:49.100\nFeature updates, app updates,\nother things like that, 12 days.\n\n205\n00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:51.600\nWe're gonna wait 12 days for phase one and\nphase two and then in phase tjree,\n\n206\n00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:53.490\nwe roll out to the company.\n\n207\n00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:57.810\nNow when we set up the software update\nserver, what it's gonna do is it's\n\n208\n00:10:57.810 --> 00:11:01.320\ngonna take our server and it's gonna\ngo and download the updates from Apple.\n\n209\n00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:06.580\nNow, for our clients, instead of\nthem going to Apple to get updates,\n\n210\n00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:10.950\nthey're gonna come to our server, and\non our server, we can green light or\n\n211\n00:11:10.950 --> 00:11:12.040\nred light the update.\n\n212\n00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:14.440\nGreen light says yes, we're gonna\nroll it out, red light we're not and\n\n213\n00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:15.960\nwe don't want people to download it yet.\n\n214\n00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:17.344\nWe start to control those updates.\n\n215\n00:11:17.344 --> 00:11:24.740\nNow the problem is, if I wanna have\na test group and a production group,\n\n216\n00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:27.330\nthe software update server really doesn't\nsupport grouping, at least, not yet.\n\n217\n00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:28.870\nOne day they'll add that update but\nfor now,\n\n218\n00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:31.360\nyou actually have to set up two servers.\n\n219\n00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:34.770\nI'm gonna have a test server and\na production server.\n\n220\n00:11:34.770 --> 00:11:37.560\nWhoever's gonna be in my test bed,\nI attach them to the test server and\n\n221\n00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:40.880\nthey get those updates\non phase two schedule.\n\n222\n00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:43.550\nAnd then everybody else,\nI attach to my production server and\n\n223\n00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:46.000\nthey get everything on\nphase three schedule.\n\n224\n00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.600\nSo that's how we wanna manage this.\n\n225\n00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:51.210\nYou're really gonna set up\ntwo software update servers.\n\n226\n00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:52.690\nFortunately, it's not hard to do.\n\n227\n00:11:52.690 --> 00:11:54.220\nIt's a pretty easy process to get set up.\n\n228\n00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:58.170\nIt is a little time consuming but\notherwise, it's not so bad.\n\n229\n00:11:58.170 --> 00:11:59.190\nLet's see that process.\n\n230\n00:11:59.190 --> 00:12:02.840\nWhat I'm gonna do is I'm gonna\nset up a software update server.\n\n231\n00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:07.510\nHere I've got a system, it's running\nOSX El Capitan or at least, I think it is.\n\n232\n00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:11.970\nYeah, so we're running El Capitan and\nI've got the server app installed.\n\n233\n00:12:11.970 --> 00:12:16.210\nWhen you install the server app, if you\nlook along the left side here, you can go\n\n234\n00:12:16.210 --> 00:12:21.680\nunder Advanced and software update is way\ndown there under the Advanced section.\n\n235\n00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:23.310\nWhen we got to turn this on,\n\n236\n00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:26.410\nthere's not a whole heck of a lot\nthat we have to change here.\n\n237\n00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:30.200\nFor starters, you've got your settings and\n\n238\n00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:32.980\nthen your updates, the settings\nare the configuration of the server.\n\n239\n00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:36.040\nThe updates are the updates that\nwe've downloaded from Apple.\n\n240\n00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:37.500\nRight now, I don't have any.\n\n241\n00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:40.760\nOnce you have updates,\nyou'll be able to control them.\n\n242\n00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:44.900\nRight here, you'll where you can choose\nto download the update, download and\n\n243\n00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:46.850\nenable the update.\n\n244\n00:12:46.850 --> 00:12:49.840\nThat means I've downloaded it and\nI'm okay, I want people to get it.\n\n245\n00:12:51.150 --> 00:12:54.010\nDisable the update says,\nI don't want people to get it.\n\n246\n00:12:54.010 --> 00:12:55.450\nThat's red light, green light.\n\n247\n00:12:55.450 --> 00:12:57.980\nGreen light is enable,\nred light is disable.\n\n248\n00:12:57.980 --> 00:13:01.510\nYou can remove the update,\nI don't want that update to exist anymore.\n\n249\n00:13:01.510 --> 00:13:05.600\nMaybe it was an update for\none of the really old Mac OS's and\n\n250\n00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:07.110\nyou're not running that in\nyour environment anymore.\n\n251\n00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:10.290\nYou don't waste storage here on your\nserver, so you delete that out.\n\n252\n00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:12.560\nAnd then View the Update,\nyou can actually look for it.\n\n253\n00:13:13.570 --> 00:13:14.810\nNow I mentioned storage,\n\n254\n00:13:14.810 --> 00:13:17.690\nstorage is one of those things that\nwe do wanna configure ahead of time.\n\n255\n00:13:17.690 --> 00:13:19.750\nWe're gonna download updates from Apple.\n\n256\n00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:21.170\nThose updates can add up.\n\n257\n00:13:21.170 --> 00:13:24.270\nLittle updates, the security updates,\nthey're normally really small,\n\n258\n00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:27.681\n2 to 300K in size, they're really tiny.\n\n259\n00:13:27.681 --> 00:13:32.700\nBut if El Capitan comes out,\nand that was like 6 gigs,\n\n260\n00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:36.180\nand that's gonna be space\nthat we occupy on our server.\n\n261\n00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:38.060\nAs you have more apps getting updated,\n\n262\n00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:41.990\nmore OS updates come out,\nyou start to run out of hard drive space.\n\n263\n00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:45.070\nOn the storage side, I always recommend\nthat you have an extra hard drive on your\n\n264\n00:13:45.070 --> 00:13:46.220\nserver and you'll see I've got two.\n\n265\n00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:47.410\nI've got my Macintosh HD.\n\n266\n00:13:47.410 --> 00:13:50.520\nThat's the hard drive where\nmy operating system is and\n\n267\n00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:53.550\nthen I've got this storage one,\nit's just a 500 gig drive\n\n268\n00:13:53.550 --> 00:13:56.759\nthat I've added to the server\nto be able to store the updates.\n\n269\n00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:02.540\nOne thing you might have noticed is\nback here under settings, it doesn't\n\n270\n00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:07.390\nreally give me an option to change where\nthese updates are gonna be stored.\n\n271\n00:14:07.390 --> 00:14:10.820\nWe saw that with, what service was\nit we were doing the other day\n\n272\n00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:12.400\nwhere I moved the storage, net install.\n\n273\n00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:16.600\nWith the net install server,\nyou go down here to net install and\n\n274\n00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:19.150\nyou can edit the storage\nlocation right there.\n\n275\n00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:20.280\nBut with software update, for\n\n276\n00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:22.170\nwhatever reason,\nthey didn't give us a button for that.\n\n277\n00:14:22.170 --> 00:14:23.640\nIt doesn't mean we can't move the storage.\n\n278\n00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:26.670\nIt just means that it's\nnot obvious how we do it.\n\n279\n00:14:26.670 --> 00:14:30.640\nThe way you do it is you go all the way\nup here to your server settings.\n\n280\n00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:33.490\nWhen I go up here to server,\nand the name of your server,\n\n281\n00:14:33.490 --> 00:14:35.810\nmine is called OSX-SERVER01.\n\n282\n00:14:35.810 --> 00:14:41.340\nWhen you go there,\nover here you'll see Overview, Settings,\n\n283\n00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:47.250\nStorage, and Access and under Settings,\nyou've got Service Data.\n\n284\n00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:52.490\nThis is the default storage location for\nall of your services.\n\n285\n00:14:52.490 --> 00:14:54.840\nSo, if there's a service that\ndoesn't let you move it's storage,\n\n286\n00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:58.440\nlike software updates, you just have\nto change the default location.\n\n287\n00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:01.560\nIt's gonna move not just software update\nbut it'll move all the other stuff too,\n\n288\n00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:02.880\nto this other location.\n\n289\n00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:05.530\nI'm gonna do that real quick cuz I\ndon't want the updates to go on my\n\n290\n00:15:05.530 --> 00:15:08.040\nMacintosh Hard Drive,\nI want it to go here, to storage.\n\n291\n00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:11.690\nMy Mac hard drive's really small,\nI want it to go to this other one.\n\n292\n00:15:11.690 --> 00:15:16.840\nNow, just be aware that that's\nmoving not just software update but\n\n293\n00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:20.180\nall the other services too and\nit can take a little bit of time.\n\n294\n00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:21.430\nIt's just warning me about that.\n\n295\n00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:24.280\nNow this is kinda critical,\n\n296\n00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:28.560\nI'm doing this before I've even\nturned on the software updates.\n\n297\n00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:32.740\nIf I did this after\nthe updates were turned on,\n\n298\n00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:35.460\nI've already downloaded from Apple and\nit's gotta move them all and\n\n299\n00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:38.940\nthat's kind of an involved process so\nwe wanna change this early.\n\n300\n00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:41.400\nNow, I got a warning on mine and\nlet me explain this warning real quick.\n\n301\n00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:45.494\nIt says, the volume Storage has\nignore permissions enabled.\n\n302\n00:15:45.494 --> 00:15:49.169\nMy storage drive is a removable drive and\non removable drives,\n\n303\n00:15:49.169 --> 00:15:53.204\nApple knows you're gonna move them\nfrom device to device to device.\n\n304\n00:15:53.204 --> 00:15:56.331\nAnd so,\nthey ignore the file permissions on there.\n\n305\n00:15:56.331 --> 00:15:57.352\nI may or may not want that.\n\n306\n00:15:57.352 --> 00:15:59.621\nNow For this it's an update drive.\n\n307\n00:15:59.621 --> 00:16:02.935\nIf somebody comes and steals this hard\ndrives and plugs in on their own computer,\n\n308\n00:16:02.935 --> 00:16:04.540\nwhat are they gonna see?\n\n309\n00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:05.120\nApple updates.\n\n310\n00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:06.790\nI don't care about that.\n\n311\n00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:08.710\nBut all the other services.\n\n312\n00:16:08.710 --> 00:16:11.340\nIf I've open directory,\nmy open directory can be stored\n\n313\n00:16:11.340 --> 00:16:14.710\nin this drives somebody could steal the\ndrive hook it up to their own computer and\n\n314\n00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:17.630\nnow they've got access to it so\nthat's why it's warning me about it.\n\n315\n00:16:17.630 --> 00:16:21.730\nIf I ignore it and if I just say okay,\nwell, it didn't move it.\n\n316\n00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:23.750\nAnd that's because of\nthe security setting.\n\n317\n00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:25.460\nSo I just need to fix that real quick.\n\n318\n00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:28.430\nSo, I'm gonna go pull up\nthe information for that drive.\n\n319\n00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:31.530\nAnd, when you look at the information for\nthe drive,\n\n320\n00:16:31.530 --> 00:16:34.640\nway down at the bottom you've\ngot Sharing & Permissions.\n\n321\n00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:38.820\nAnd way down below that,\nIgnore ownership on this volume.\n\n322\n00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:41.640\nAnd it will be turned on for\nremovable drives by default.\n\n323\n00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:44.310\nIf I had done an internal drive,\nthat wouldn't have happened, right.\n\n324\n00:16:44.310 --> 00:16:47.140\nInternal drives, they know you're\nnot going to be moving them around.\n\n325\n00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:49.230\nSo, let me just turn that option off.\n\n326\n00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:53.590\nAnd, there we go.\n\n327\n00:16:53.590 --> 00:16:56.370\nAnd so now,\npermissions are going to apply.\n\n328\n00:16:56.370 --> 00:16:59.880\nAnd so we'll go ahead and get rid of that,\nand we'll move that location again,\n\n329\n00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:01.460\nand it should be happy this time.\n\n330\n00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:04.320\nThere we go.\nSo am I sure I wanna move it?\n\n331\n00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:06.240\nI'll say OK and there it goes moving.\n\n332\n00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:07.910\nAnd see how it's copying files?\n\n333\n00:17:07.910 --> 00:17:11.440\nAgain if I had already turned on\nthe updates, this could take an hour,\n\n334\n00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:14.190\ntwo hours, it can take a while depending\non how many updates it's gonna move.\n\n335\n00:17:14.190 --> 00:17:18.900\nSo, I always recommend turning this\non before you download your updates.\n\n336\n00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:19.550\nAll right.\n\n337\n00:17:19.550 --> 00:17:23.320\nNow, as soon as that's done, now, I go and\nturn on my software updates server and\n\n338\n00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:25.850\nit will start downloading updates and\nmoving to this other drive.\n\n339\n00:17:25.850 --> 00:17:29.110\nBut, see how it's moving data location for\ncalendar.\n\n340\n00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:31.010\nI saw profile manager a minute ago.\n\n341\n00:17:31.010 --> 00:17:32.970\nIt's all of these services\ngoing along with it.\n\n342\n00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:36.270\nAll right.\nNow, we're gonna turn on the software\n\n343\n00:17:36.270 --> 00:17:36.940\nupdate server here.\n\n344\n00:17:36.940 --> 00:17:39.030\nWe're gonna get it enabled and\nup and running.\n\n345\n00:17:39.030 --> 00:17:41.800\nAnd once that's done,\nit's gonna download updates from Apple and\n\n346\n00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:43.140\nthat process takes a while.\n\n347\n00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:47.850\nIt'll take a good 45 minutes to an hour\nto just get the initial list of all of\n\n348\n00:17:47.850 --> 00:17:50.760\nthe updates that are available better yet\nto start downloading them.\n\n349\n00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:54.840\nAnd in fact, it usually won't download\nthem automatically until you kinda trigger\n\n350\n00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:57.120\nit so we have to tell it\nto automatically download.\n\n351\n00:17:57.120 --> 00:18:01.620\nNow, after we get the server set up,\nwe've gotta get the clients connected to\n\n352\n00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:03.885\nit also, so there's a little\nbit more work to be done there.\n\n353\n00:18:03.885 --> 00:18:06.080\nOop, looks like my move\njust finished there, so.\n\n354\n00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:10.250\nAll right, so I'm gonna go back\ndown here to Software Update, and\n\n355\n00:18:10.250 --> 00:18:15.150\nthe only real setting I have\nis Automatic or Manual mode.\n\n356\n00:18:15.150 --> 00:18:17.100\nAutomatic mode is normally what we want.\n\n357\n00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:20.140\nAll updates are downloaded from Apple and\nimmediately enabled for\n\n358\n00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:21.470\nclients to install.\n\n359\n00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:25.040\nSo, it's gonna download these and\nmake them immediately available.\n\n360\n00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:27.380\nUpdates no longer supported\nby Apple are removed.\n\n361\n00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:30.910\nSo if you've got older systems that\nare no longer supported by Apple,\n\n362\n00:18:30.910 --> 00:18:32.690\nit won't get those updates, right.\n\n363\n00:18:32.690 --> 00:18:36.580\nAnd as the time goes on it will prune\nthose updates off and throw them away.\n\n364\n00:18:36.580 --> 00:18:40.580\nYou might wanna go manual and I am gonna\ngo manual just here on the show because I\n\n365\n00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:43.320\ndon't wanna wait an hour for\nit to download all the updates.\n\n366\n00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:45.300\nI just wanna pick and\nchoose one or two updates.\n\n367\n00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:49.450\nSo when you do it this way, what it's\ngonna do is it's gonna download a list\n\n368\n00:18:49.450 --> 00:18:52.750\nof the available updates, but it's not\ngonna actually download the updates.\n\n369\n00:18:52.750 --> 00:18:54.900\nNow, why would I want just a list?\n\n370\n00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:58.950\nWell, If you have the list you can\nstill enable and disable updates.\n\n371\n00:18:58.950 --> 00:19:01.640\nAnd people will just have to\ndownload them from Apple.\n\n372\n00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:03.070\nSo they'll just reach out to Apple and\nget them.\n\n373\n00:19:03.070 --> 00:19:04.820\nIt still works, right?\n\n374\n00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:08.430\nBut if I wanna save bandwidth,\nI wanna download the updates to here.\n\n375\n00:19:08.430 --> 00:19:12.370\nThink about, if I have one computer,\nI go out to Apple, I download the update.\n\n376\n00:19:12.370 --> 00:19:13.270\nBig deal.\n\n377\n00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:16.810\nBut, if I have 1,000 computers, that's\n1,000 computers, all going to Apple,\n\n378\n00:19:16.810 --> 00:19:18.310\nall downloading the same update.\n\n379\n00:19:18.310 --> 00:19:19.970\nIt's wasting bandwidth.\n\n380\n00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:25.570\nSo, instead, what I can do is I can\ndownload the update here to the server,\n\n381\n00:19:25.570 --> 00:19:29.610\nand now the 1,000 people just get it right\nhere from me, off my local area network.\n\n382\n00:19:29.610 --> 00:19:31.030\nThey're not eating up my WAN bandwidth.\n\n383\n00:19:31.030 --> 00:19:32.900\nSo, ideally, we want to download.\n\n384\n00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:35.530\nBut, here,\nwe have to download them manually and\n\n385\n00:19:35.530 --> 00:19:37.520\nthen it will save them\nuntil we delete them.\n\n386\n00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:39.040\n>> Don, with that automatic setting,\n\n387\n00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:42.970\nyou had mentioned how you control\nusing this server in this process.\n\n388\n00:19:42.970 --> 00:19:46.610\nYou can control when or\nif somebody gets an update.\n\n389\n00:19:46.610 --> 00:19:48.130\nDoes this kind of negate that process?\n\n390\n00:19:48.130 --> 00:19:50.990\nCuz it says automatically enable them for\nusers?\n\n391\n00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:52.849\nDo you not get to pick and choose,\nor don't get to pick and choose?\n\n392\n00:19:52.849 --> 00:19:55.630\n>> So, you still get to pick and\nchoose, sort of.\n\n393\n00:19:55.630 --> 00:19:59.270\nThey're gonna be enabled by default but\nyou can go and disable them.\n\n394\n00:19:59.270 --> 00:20:00.320\n>> Okay.\n>> Right.\n\n395\n00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:04.160\nAnd so you can do that process to come and\ndisable them but if you're just trying to\n\n396\n00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:07.010\nsave bandwidth, you put in automatic and\nit automatically enables and that's that.\n\n397\n00:20:07.010 --> 00:20:09.350\nBut if you're trying to\ncontrol the roll-out,\n\n398\n00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:10.930\nyou'll wanna be in manual like I'm doing.\n\n399\n00:20:10.930 --> 00:20:12.590\n>> And\none other question too about bandwidth.\n\n400\n00:20:12.590 --> 00:20:13.410\nYou had mentioned, obviously,\n\n401\n00:20:13.410 --> 00:20:16.830\nwe know that WAN links are a little bit\nslower than the internal LAN links.\n\n402\n00:20:16.830 --> 00:20:20.820\nNow if you do deploy, and we're gonna see\nhere in a bit how to configure the client.\n\n403\n00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:25.270\nIf the clients, let's say, do all of them\nconnect back to that centralized server,\n\n404\n00:20:25.270 --> 00:20:28.500\ncould you see some performance hits\non your internal network as well?\n\n405\n00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:30.500\nIs it like any network communication?\n\n406\n00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:32.470\n>> You could, yeah,\nit's like any network communication.\n\n407\n00:20:32.470 --> 00:20:33.950\n>> Okay.\n>> It's just file transfers that are\n\n408\n00:20:33.950 --> 00:20:37.260\nhappening on the network and they'll use\nApple file protocol and exchange the data.\n\n409\n00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:40.360\nOr actually, they use HTTPS for\na lot of it.\n\n410\n00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:42.760\nAnd they use Apple file protocol for\nother parts.\n\n411\n00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:45.790\nBut it'll basically reach out and get\nthose and you could saturate the system.\n\n412\n00:20:45.790 --> 00:20:47.949\nIt's something you just\nhave to keep an eye on.\n\n413\n00:20:47.949 --> 00:20:48.449\nAll right.\n\n414\n00:20:48.449 --> 00:20:52.323\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and turn this on, so\nI'll flip my little switch here to on and\n\n415\n00:20:52.323 --> 00:20:54.530\nnow, I'm up and running.\n\n416\n00:20:54.530 --> 00:20:55.540\nWell, I say I'm up and running.\n\n417\n00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:58.180\nI don't have any updates so\nit's not really doing anything.\n\n418\n00:20:58.180 --> 00:21:02.160\nSo, I'm gonna jump over\nto my update tab and\n\n419\n00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:05.350\nhere's that automatically download new\nupdates and see how it's not checked?\n\n420\n00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:08.000\nCuz I didn't choose that,\nI chose manual but if I change my mind,\n\n421\n00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.120\nI can flip right over to that.\n\n422\n00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:14.360\nAnd then down here at the bottom is where\nI can force it to check for updates.\n\n423\n00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:17.280\nSo I'm gonna have a check for\nupdates right now and when it checks for\n\n424\n00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:21.540\nupdates it's reaching out to Apple and\nit's pulling down a list of updates to\n\n425\n00:21:21.540 --> 00:21:25.450\nsee what's available and\nthis can take a while.\n\n426\n00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:29.470\nIf you're just sitting and watching it, I\nhave nothing on the screen here that helps\n\n427\n00:21:29.470 --> 00:21:32.200\nme know that anything is happening at all.\n\n428\n00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:34.820\nI just don't see anything, okay?\n\n429\n00:21:34.820 --> 00:21:36.860\nSo, if I wanna keep track of this,\n\n430\n00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:39.090\nin real life land what I do\nis I go take a lunch break.\n\n431\n00:21:39.090 --> 00:21:40.040\nI just leave.\n\n432\n00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:41.770\n[LAUGH] Come back later.\n\n433\n00:21:41.770 --> 00:21:45.260\nBut, if we actually wanna verify it's\nworking, you can look in the server logs.\n\n434\n00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:47.560\nSo if I go up here to my Server Logs.\n\n435\n00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:50.010\nAnd I've filtered this down\nto my Software Update.\n\n436\n00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:54.320\nSo I'm just gonna go in here and\nfind Software Update.\n\n437\n00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:55.920\nYou got an Error Log and a Service Log.\n\n438\n00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:58.242\nAnd if I go into the Service Log,\n\n439\n00:21:58.242 --> 00:22:03.323\nhere I can see Retrieving remote\ncatalog and Updating local catalog.\n\n440\n00:22:03.323 --> 00:22:06.139\nSo here it is reaching out to\nApple looking for that data and\n\n441\n00:22:06.139 --> 00:22:08.449\ndownloading it and\ngetting that information.\n\n442\n00:22:08.449 --> 00:22:11.368\nAnd you'll see the different OSes\nthat it's pulling for, mountainlion,\n\n443\n00:22:11.368 --> 00:22:13.080\nsnowleopard, leopard, and so on.\n\n444\n00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:16.850\nIt's gonna move through each of them as it\ngets Mavericks, and Elkepiton, Yosemite,\n\n445\n00:22:16.850 --> 00:22:17.510\nall those guys too.\n\n446\n00:22:17.510 --> 00:22:22.267\nSo, it's [INAUDIBLE] it is working but\nit's just kind of in the background.\n\n447\n00:22:22.267 --> 00:22:25.259\nIt's silent and\nI don't necessarily get to see that.\n\n448\n00:22:25.259 --> 00:22:27.878\nAnd now you'll see my screen's\nchanged to Reading Updates,\n\n449\n00:22:27.878 --> 00:22:29.700\nit's parsing all those files that it got.\n\n450\n00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:32.799\nAll right, well, that's sitting right\nthere the next thing I need to do is I\n\n451\n00:22:32.799 --> 00:22:34.699\nneed to get my clients connected,\nall right?\n\n452\n00:22:34.699 --> 00:22:40.750\nNow, if I've got a production update\nserver and a test update server.\n\n453\n00:22:40.750 --> 00:22:43.970\nI might want the test update server\nto automatically download enable, but\n\n454\n00:22:43.970 --> 00:22:46.030\nthe production one is manual so\nthat I can pick and\n\n455\n00:22:46.030 --> 00:22:47.960\nchose right that's how\nwe normally set this up.\n\n456\n00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:51.230\nAnd then I would go to the clients and\nconnect them to the server that was part\n\n457\n00:22:51.230 --> 00:22:54.010\nof the group I wanted them to be in,\neither test or production.\n\n458\n00:22:54.010 --> 00:22:56.640\nThere's three different ways\nwe can connect a client\n\n459\n00:22:56.640 --> 00:22:58.080\nto the software update server.\n\n460\n00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:01.100\nOne way is using the profile\nmanager which we covered\n\n461\n00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:02.360\nback in the profile manager episode.\n\n462\n00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:05.530\nSo we can specify there and\npoint to the server that we wanna use.\n\n463\n00:23:05.530 --> 00:23:07.420\nThat's probably the easiest way.\n\n464\n00:23:07.420 --> 00:23:10.030\nAnother way is we can do\nit from the command line.\n\n465\n00:23:10.030 --> 00:23:13.315\nAnd from the command line,\nwe can either go right to the client and\n\n466\n00:23:13.315 --> 00:23:16.700\nmanually put it in or we can use\nsomething like Apple Remote Desktop.\n\n467\n00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:19.670\nIn the Apple Remote Desktop episodes,\nI showed you guys how we can send a Unix\n\n468\n00:23:19.670 --> 00:23:23.730\ncommand out to your clients, well,\nyou can send command line commands and\n\n469\n00:23:23.730 --> 00:23:25.910\nconnect your clients to\nthe particular server that you want.\n\n470\n00:23:25.910 --> 00:23:29.750\nSo, Profile Manager is the easiest\nbecause it's kind of GUI.\n\n471\n00:23:29.750 --> 00:23:33.200\nThe Apple remote desktop\nworks using command line or\n\n472\n00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:34.640\njust straight up using the command line.\n\n473\n00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:35.510\nAnd that's what I'm going to do here.\n\n474\n00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:37.230\nI'm going to just straight\nup use the command line.\n\n475\n00:23:37.230 --> 00:23:40.150\nIf you want to see the profile\nmanager way you can jump over\n\n476\n00:23:40.150 --> 00:23:41.210\nto the profile manager episode.\n\n477\n00:23:41.210 --> 00:23:42.580\nWe do it in there.\n\n478\n00:23:42.580 --> 00:23:44.710\nSo, if I take a look at my client.\n\n479\n00:23:44.710 --> 00:23:46.630\nSo here's my client.\n\n480\n00:23:46.630 --> 00:23:48.698\nBy default, it's gonna go out to Apple.\n\n481\n00:23:48.698 --> 00:23:51.194\nSo when it does update its\ngonna reach out to Apple and\n\n482\n00:23:51.194 --> 00:23:53.421\nthat's where its gonna\nget the updates from.\n\n483\n00:23:53.421 --> 00:23:56.899\nBut, if I want to point\nit to my own server,\n\n484\n00:23:56.899 --> 00:24:01.458\nWhat I need to do is fire open\na command prompt like this.\n\n485\n00:24:01.458 --> 00:24:05.963\nAnd then there's a nice little command we\ncan run to tell it to use our own internal\n\n486\n00:24:05.963 --> 00:24:07.450\nupdate server.\n\n487\n00:24:07.450 --> 00:24:08.959\nSo I'm gonna do that right here.\n\n488\n00:24:08.959 --> 00:24:15.003\nWe're just gonna punch this one in and\nI'm gonna say defaults write.\n\n489\n00:24:15.003 --> 00:24:17.100\nSo I'm changing one of the default value.\n\n490\n00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:22.667\nSo defaults write, and then I need to\ntell the preference that I'm changing.\n\n491\n00:24:22.667 --> 00:24:24.724\nSo I'm gonna point\n\n492\n00:24:24.724 --> 00:24:31.417\n/Library/Preferences/com.apple.SoftwareUp-\ndate.\n\n493\n00:24:31.417 --> 00:24:39.002\nSo I'm modifying the software update,\nand I'm gonna modify the CatalogURL.\n\n494\n00:24:39.002 --> 00:24:41.882\nWhen you do an update,\nyou reach out to Apple server and\n\n495\n00:24:41.882 --> 00:24:45.020\nyou look for\na particular file called the catalog.\n\n496\n00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:48.124\nAnd the catalog is just the list of all\nthe available updates, and you compare\n\n497\n00:24:48.124 --> 00:24:51.209\nthat list to what you have, and\nwhat's different is what you're missing.\n\n498\n00:24:51.209 --> 00:24:53.090\nThe catalog file's what drives all this.\n\n499\n00:24:53.090 --> 00:24:55.430\nSo I'm gonna tell you a new CatalogURL.\n\n500\n00:24:55.430 --> 00:24:59.060\nDon't go to Apple, go to this other URL.\n\n501\n00:24:59.060 --> 00:25:01.876\nAnd then I'm gonna point it to the server,\nand you gotta put it in quotes.\n\n502\n00:25:01.876 --> 00:25:06.042\nSo I'm gonna say, http:// and\nthen I'm gonna put my server.\n\n503\n00:25:06.042 --> 00:25:11.502\nSo my server's called OSX server01 or\nyou can do the IP address if you wanted\n\n504\n00:25:11.502 --> 00:25:16.459\nif you didn't have DNS names,\nand then you've gotta do :8088.\n\n505\n00:25:16.459 --> 00:25:21.664\nThe update server runs its own little web\nserver, but it can't go on port 80 because\n\n506\n00:25:21.664 --> 00:25:27.042\nyou have the actual website's service in\nthe server app, so it uses 8088 instead.\n\n507\n00:25:27.042 --> 00:25:34.675\nAnd then we'll do /index.sucatalog and\ndid I spell that wrong?\n\n508\n00:25:34.675 --> 00:25:36.834\nSu catalog, no that's right.\n\n509\n00:25:36.834 --> 00:25:39.022\nSo I'm pointing to a new catalog,\n\n510\n00:25:39.022 --> 00:25:42.650\na catalog that's on my own\nserver not on Apple's.\n\n511\n00:25:42.650 --> 00:25:43.623\nIf you have a production and\n\n512\n00:25:43.623 --> 00:25:45.917\na test you would have two different\ncommand lines for you to run.\n\n513\n00:25:45.917 --> 00:25:46.978\nOne on production systems,\n\n514\n00:25:46.978 --> 00:25:49.650\none on test systems and\npoint them at the different servers.\n\n515\n00:25:49.650 --> 00:25:52.430\nAnd again, if I’m using Apple Remote\nDesktop this is just the command I would\n\n516\n00:25:52.430 --> 00:25:54.850\npush out with Apple Remote Desktop.\n\n517\n00:25:54.850 --> 00:26:00.032\nAnd when I run that it will push it and\nlet see it fail.\n\n518\n00:26:00.032 --> 00:26:01.126\nDo I need to sudo this one?\n\n519\n00:26:01.126 --> 00:26:02.700\nI might need to be an administrator for\nthis.\n\n520\n00:26:02.700 --> 00:26:04.084\nLet me do a sudo.\n\n521\n00:26:06.709 --> 00:26:09.377\nAnd apparently I need to know my password.\n\n522\n00:26:09.377 --> 00:26:10.390\nThere we go!\n\n523\n00:26:10.390 --> 00:26:12.626\nWell, I’m gonna rerun it again\njust to make sure that worked.\n\n524\n00:26:12.626 --> 00:26:13.835\nThere we go, perfect.\n\n525\n00:26:13.835 --> 00:26:15.127\nSo I didn’t need to be an administrator.\n\n526\n00:26:15.127 --> 00:26:18.048\nSo I had to add to sudo to the beginning\nof that and then it ran, and\n\n527\n00:26:18.048 --> 00:26:21.420\napparently I typed my password wrong,\nbut I got it right the second time.\n\n528\n00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:26.210\nSo now it’s written and now,\nI'm set to use that other server.\n\n529\n00:26:26.210 --> 00:26:31.290\nSo instead of going out to Apple,\nI'm gonna go to my server for the update.\n\n530\n00:26:31.290 --> 00:26:33.510\nNow on the client,\nwe still have our update settings.\n\n531\n00:26:33.510 --> 00:26:35.900\nIf I go into system preferences and\n\n532\n00:26:35.900 --> 00:26:42.110\nI go into the App Store icon,\nwe've still got these settings right here.\n\n533\n00:26:42.110 --> 00:26:44.554\nAutomatically check for updates,\nDownload updates when available,\n\n534\n00:26:44.554 --> 00:26:45.334\nInstall the updates.\n\n535\n00:26:45.334 --> 00:26:47.834\nI'm gonna install OS X updates.\n\n536\n00:26:47.834 --> 00:26:51.252\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nspecify those settings and now,\n\n537\n00:26:51.252 --> 00:26:53.710\nI'm set to where I'll do those updates.\n\n538\n00:26:53.710 --> 00:26:58.127\nI'll get that information, and\nI'm getting it from my own server.\n\n539\n00:26:58.127 --> 00:27:00.919\nSo that's getting the client set up and\nthis client is now ready to rock.\n\n540\n00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:03.376\nSo what's my next step?\n\n541\n00:27:03.376 --> 00:27:07.870\nWell my next step is to\napprove some updates.\n\n542\n00:27:07.870 --> 00:27:10.120\nIf I'm set for automatic,\nI'm actually done.\n\n543\n00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:12.440\nEverything's gonna work,\nit's working off my server now.\n\n544\n00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:15.580\nBut I chose manual and so\nI've gotta get my server set up.\n\n545\n00:27:15.580 --> 00:27:18.500\nAnd I don't know if my\nserver's done there we go.\n\n546\n00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:22.627\nGoing back to my server, I've got a lot\nmore information here than I had before.\n\n547\n00:27:22.627 --> 00:27:26.166\nSo I'm under my software updates,\nand now we'll look at these updates.\n\n548\n00:27:26.166 --> 00:27:29.876\nThere's some that are old like\nOS X Mavericks Developer Preview.\n\n549\n00:27:29.876 --> 00:27:33.310\nI don't know why I'd want a developer\npreview of an OS that's already gone gold.\n\n550\n00:27:33.310 --> 00:27:34.834\nBut there it is, I could get it.\n\n551\n00:27:34.834 --> 00:27:39.190\nThere's some voice updates, there's\nsome other ones, multilingual updates.\n\n552\n00:27:39.190 --> 00:27:43.209\nI'm just gonna sort by date here and\nhere we go.\n\n553\n00:27:43.209 --> 00:27:47.747\nSo I can see for example the iTunes\nProducer had an update on March 7,\n\n554\n00:27:47.747 --> 00:27:49.084\njust a few days ago.\n\n555\n00:27:49.084 --> 00:27:52.940\nSo that's the one out there it's 260 megs,\nit's available but\n\n556\n00:27:52.940 --> 00:27:54.709\nI haven't downloaded it yet.\n\n557\n00:27:54.709 --> 00:27:58.596\nI don't know how to copy local right here,\nbut this is an update that is currently\n\n558\n00:27:58.596 --> 00:28:01.430\navailable and\nI might wanna role out to my systems.\n\n559\n00:28:01.430 --> 00:28:04.460\nAs you start looking down the list here,\nyou'll see more things that have come out.\n\n560\n00:28:04.460 --> 00:28:07.834\nPhoto Content,\nApple Directory, AppleConnect.\n\n561\n00:28:07.834 --> 00:28:13.030\nEach of these are different services\nthat Apple has been pushing updates for.\n\n562\n00:28:13.030 --> 00:28:16.584\nSome printer updates, very exciting.\n\n563\n00:28:16.584 --> 00:28:17.251\nWhat else do we got?\n\n564\n00:28:17.251 --> 00:28:19.792\nHere, El Capitan updates.\n\n565\n00:28:19.792 --> 00:28:22.459\nHere is 10.11.3.\n\n566\n00:28:22.459 --> 00:28:25.700\nSo there's the update and\nsee how there's two versions of it?\n\n567\n00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:30.640\nThere's one that's 660 megs and\nthere's one that's 1.4 gigs, and\n\n568\n00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:33.600\nthese are just updates to El Capitan.\n\n569\n00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:35.730\nNow, why the two different sizes?\n\n570\n00:28:35.730 --> 00:28:39.484\nWell it's based on what operating\nsystem you are updating from and\n\n571\n00:28:39.484 --> 00:28:40.834\nwhat updates you have.\n\n572\n00:28:40.834 --> 00:28:44.814\nSo each of those kind of influence that,\nbut here's some security updates and\n\n573\n00:28:44.814 --> 00:28:47.640\nsecurity updates are really\nsuper important.\n\n574\n00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:50.083\nI wanna get this updates\nout as fast as possible.\n\n575\n00:28:50.083 --> 00:28:52.709\nSo I see them and\nI recognize their important.\n\n576\n00:28:52.709 --> 00:28:56.489\nSo over here it says, available I'm\ngonna hit that drop down arrow and\n\n577\n00:28:56.489 --> 00:28:59.580\nsee I've got Download,\nand Download and Enable.\n\n578\n00:28:59.580 --> 00:29:02.680\nDownload's just gonna put a copy right\nhere but not necessarily turn it on.\n\n579\n00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:04.530\nI wanna Download and Enable,\n\n580\n00:29:04.530 --> 00:29:07.870\nand I'm gonna do both of those\nsecurity updates right there.\n\n581\n00:29:07.870 --> 00:29:11.860\nI want those guys ready to go on\nmy network rolling out right now.\n\n582\n00:29:13.060 --> 00:29:16.740\nOther ones, I might just wanna\ndownload them to have them ready, and\n\n583\n00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:18.680\nthen enable them later on.\n\n584\n00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:21.831\nSo I'm gonna have a test server\nI'm already enabling, but\n\n585\n00:29:21.831 --> 00:29:23.667\nhere I'm just downloading them.\n\n586\n00:29:23.667 --> 00:29:26.390\nSo when the time comes,\nall I have to do is click enable.\n\n587\n00:29:26.390 --> 00:29:29.142\nAnd you can highlight more\nthan one at a time, and\n\n588\n00:29:29.142 --> 00:29:33.250\nuse a little box down here to come in and\nDownload and Enable or whatever.\n\n589\n00:29:33.250 --> 00:29:38.131\nAnd if you ever wonder what the update is,\nlike I can choose that Security Update and\n\n590\n00:29:38.131 --> 00:29:40.584\nyou've got the View Update option here.\n\n591\n00:29:40.584 --> 00:29:44.084\nAnd when you view the update it'll give\nyou a little more information about it and\n\n592\n00:29:44.084 --> 00:29:47.360\ngive you a link to Apple, so you can\ngo and find out what the heck it is.\n\n593\n00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:50.390\nFind out why it's important or\nwhy I need that.\n\n594\n00:29:50.390 --> 00:29:52.335\nBut it's going and\ndownloading that in the background.\n\n595\n00:29:52.335 --> 00:29:55.709\nAnd when it downloads it, it's gonna\nbe throwing it into my storage drive.\n\n596\n00:29:55.709 --> 00:29:57.949\nAnd there's not really a whole\nlot of reason to do it but\n\n597\n00:29:57.949 --> 00:29:59.910\nif we browse in to the storage drive.\n\n598\n00:29:59.910 --> 00:30:04.061\nYou'll see that you've got a Library\nfolder and then Server, and\n\n599\n00:30:04.061 --> 00:30:06.001\nthen in here Software Update.\n\n600\n00:30:06.001 --> 00:30:08.500\nAnd inside of Software Update there's\nData, and that's where the updates go.\n\n601\n00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:10.126\nAnd I think it's protected.\n\n602\n00:30:10.126 --> 00:30:11.280\nIs it gonna let me in there?\n\n603\n00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:12.470\nIt let me in there.\n\n604\n00:30:12.470 --> 00:30:15.840\nSo if I browse int here,\nhere's the HTML file, the catalog.\n\n605\n00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:19.470\nSo this is the catalog file that\nit's gonna reach out to, to get.\n\n606\n00:30:19.470 --> 00:30:25.050\nAnd then inside of content here's the\ndownloads and here's the actual updates.\n\n607\n00:30:25.050 --> 00:30:30.390\nAnd they have an organization system that\nI'm not really aware of how it works.\n\n608\n00:30:30.390 --> 00:30:33.750\nSo as far finding those security updates,\nI'm not sure what folder they would ended\n\n609\n00:30:33.750 --> 00:30:37.880\nup in, but\nthere's usually a place holder item.\n\n610\n00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:40.020\nAnd then when you download it\nthe actual update comes in here.\n\n611\n00:30:40.020 --> 00:30:44.083\nSo see these little smd files, these\nare just notes that the update exists, and\n\n612\n00:30:44.083 --> 00:30:48.042\nthen when we download it the actual update\nwill be present in this folder too.\n\n613\n00:30:48.042 --> 00:30:49.830\nSo we get the download placed in here.\n\n614\n00:30:49.830 --> 00:30:54.389\nSo all that's kind of happening in the\nbackground and as those get downloaded and\n\n615\n00:30:54.389 --> 00:30:57.751\nupdated, we can then come back in and\nmake them available.\n\n616\n00:30:57.751 --> 00:31:00.001\nSo why is this taking so long?\n\n617\n00:31:00.001 --> 00:31:01.639\nSometimes it's not that\nit takes a long time,\n\n618\n00:31:01.639 --> 00:31:03.650\nit's just that the screen doesn't refresh.\n\n619\n00:31:03.650 --> 00:31:05.000\nI just forced to refresh on mine and\n\n620\n00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.760\nI can see this one Downloading,\nthe other one is still Waiting.\n\n621\n00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:10.959\nSo let's go ahead and\ndownload them to get them in placed.\n\n622\n00:31:10.959 --> 00:31:14.880\nSo once that’s all in place,\nI’m now good to go.\n\n623\n00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:17.146\nI can go here and download updates,\nI can enable them,\n\n624\n00:31:17.146 --> 00:31:20.115\nI can disable them if I don’t want\nanybody else to get the updates.\n\n625\n00:31:20.115 --> 00:31:22.538\nI need to change my mind on that one,\nlet me disable it, and\n\n626\n00:31:22.538 --> 00:31:24.376\nnow it will stop rolling\nout on the network.\n\n627\n00:31:24.376 --> 00:31:25.120\n>> All right, good Don.\n\n628\n00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:26.180\nI’m gonna throw you curve ball.\n\n629\n00:31:26.180 --> 00:31:27.360\nI got a scenario for you.\n\n630\n00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:31.280\nHundred of those thousand computers\nthat just we just set up for\n\n631\n00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:34.800\nthe software update to apply.\n\n632\n00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:37.980\nLet's say, 100 of those computers, I'm\ndeciding we're gonna give them to charity.\n\n633\n00:31:37.980 --> 00:31:40.639\nWe're gonna to give them to the school and\nwe no longer want\n\n634\n00:31:40.639 --> 00:31:43.751\nthem pointed to our server,\nbecause they're not on our networks.\n\n635\n00:31:43.751 --> 00:31:46.373\nIs this a one way street once we set\nthem up for the software update and\n\n636\n00:31:46.373 --> 00:31:47.850\nwe point them to our internal server?\n\n637\n00:31:47.850 --> 00:31:50.491\nCan we configure a Mac the other way?\n\n638\n00:31:50.491 --> 00:31:52.676\n>> Yeah,\nyou can just delete that preference and\n\n639\n00:31:52.676 --> 00:31:54.984\nthen the system will recreate it and\nput it back.\n\n640\n00:31:54.984 --> 00:31:58.461\nBut the best thing, if you're gonna be\nsending a computer at to somebody else.\n\n641\n00:31:58.461 --> 00:32:02.048\nIt's best to format it and\nput a clean OS back on it and that way,\n\n642\n00:32:02.048 --> 00:32:03.760\nall those settings are gone.\n\n643\n00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:05.310\nThat'll give you a better reinstall.\n\n644\n00:32:05.310 --> 00:32:06.650\nBut if it's just in a pinch.\n\n645\n00:32:06.650 --> 00:32:11.330\nIf, for example, maybe somebody's\ngonna start working from home.\n\n646\n00:32:11.330 --> 00:32:12.592\nAnd s,o they're gonna\ntake their computer home.\n\n647\n00:32:12.592 --> 00:32:14.500\nAnd you don't wanna it to have to\nreach back into your corporate\n\n648\n00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:15.259\nnetwork to get updates.\n\n649\n00:32:15.259 --> 00:32:16.810\nYou want them to just go to Apple.\n\n650\n00:32:16.810 --> 00:32:20.410\nJust delete that preference, and\nI use that defaults write command.\n\n651\n00:32:20.410 --> 00:32:22.530\nYou can use the defaults delete and\nchange it.\n\n652\n00:32:22.530 --> 00:32:24.260\nOr you can get the actual Apple URI.\n\n653\n00:32:24.260 --> 00:32:25.780\nI don't know Apple's URL offhand.\n\n654\n00:32:27.020 --> 00:32:30.380\nBut, yeah, I don't know that one offhand.\n\n655\n00:32:30.380 --> 00:32:32.050\nBut if you delete the preference,\nit'll recreate it.\n\n656\n00:32:32.050 --> 00:32:33.390\nIt'll just go right back to Apple.\n\n657\n00:32:33.390 --> 00:32:35.090\nSo, there's always that option.\n\n658\n00:32:35.090 --> 00:32:37.150\nAnd even if we left it at our server,\n\n659\n00:32:37.150 --> 00:32:40.590\nif it fails to connect after\nenough times it'll bug the user.\n\n660\n00:32:40.590 --> 00:32:42.370\nAnd then,\nthen they'll get a little help document.\n\n661\n00:32:42.370 --> 00:32:44.100\nIt'll show them how to reset that, too.\n\n662\n00:32:44.100 --> 00:32:45.370\nSo, there's a few\ndifferent ways it can go.\n\n663\n00:32:46.690 --> 00:32:49.291\nAll right.\nBut at this point, we're in business.\n\n664\n00:32:49.291 --> 00:32:52.680\nThere's positives to the system and\nthere's negatives.\n\n665\n00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:54.872\nOn the positive side,\nit's pretty easy to implement, wasn't it?\n\n666\n00:32:54.872 --> 00:32:58.450\nI mean, I really just flipped a switch and\nmoved some storage, and that was about it.\n\n667\n00:32:58.450 --> 00:33:00.040\nOn negative side,\n\n668\n00:33:00.040 --> 00:33:04.200\nthere's two things that it doesn't\ndo that people usually ask about.\n\n669\n00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:08.925\nOne thing is, I can't see who all\ngot the update and who all didn't.\n\n670\n00:33:08.925 --> 00:33:09.960\nAll right?\n\n671\n00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:12.380\nI just approved a critical\nsecurity update.\n\n672\n00:33:12.380 --> 00:33:14.240\nHow do I know everybody got it?\n\n673\n00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:15.090\nI don't, right?\n\n674\n00:33:15.090 --> 00:33:18.560\nThe Software Update service can't do that,\nbut Apple Remote Desktop can.\n\n675\n00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:22.980\nI can go into Apple Remote Desktop and\nI can pull the software versions from my\n\n676\n00:33:22.980 --> 00:33:25.100\nclients and see the updates\nthat are installed and get it.\n\n677\n00:33:25.100 --> 00:33:28.170\nSo, by itself Software Update\ncan't show that.\n\n678\n00:33:28.170 --> 00:33:29.370\nBut Apple Remote Desktop can.\n\n679\n00:33:29.370 --> 00:33:31.950\nSo, use the two together to\nget that perfect environment.\n\n680\n00:33:31.950 --> 00:33:34.218\nAnd the second thing is,\nI approved this update.\n\n681\n00:33:34.218 --> 00:33:35.200\nSo, it's rolling out.\n\n682\n00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:38.100\nClients are gonna start getting it now,\nright?\n\n683\n00:33:38.100 --> 00:33:40.810\nAnd let's say that I find\nsome kind of problem.\n\n684\n00:33:40.810 --> 00:33:42.420\nIt breaks an application.\n\n685\n00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:47.810\nWell, I can come in here and disable\nthe update so nobody else is gonna get it.\n\n686\n00:33:47.810 --> 00:33:50.650\nBut what about the people\nwho already got it?\n\n687\n00:33:50.650 --> 00:33:52.640\nI don't have a way to revoke the update.\n\n688\n00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:55.340\nI can't take the update\nback once it's out.\n\n689\n00:33:55.340 --> 00:33:59.420\nAnd that's why Apple recommends\nthe phased approach to deploying.\n\n690\n00:33:59.420 --> 00:34:03.410\nSo, remember for the exam, the best\npractice, the phase one is seven days.\n\n691\n00:34:03.410 --> 00:34:07.240\nWait seven days for rolling out an update\nin case the vendor updates it again.\n\n692\n00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:10.130\nPhase two, spend five days testing.\n\n693\n00:34:10.130 --> 00:34:12.510\nJust a couple of test machines\nto make sure it's okay.\n\n694\n00:34:12.510 --> 00:34:16.950\nBut make sure those machines are typical\nuse machines, not just IT people.\n\n695\n00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:19.580\nAnd then phase three,\ngeneral deployment, right?\n\n696\n00:34:19.580 --> 00:34:20.660\nRoll it out to everybody else.\n\n697\n00:34:20.660 --> 00:34:22.130\nSo, follow that phased approach, and\n\n698\n00:34:22.130 --> 00:34:25.680\nthen you won't need to worry about\nrevoking that update, and you'll be fine.\n\n699\n00:34:25.680 --> 00:34:27.230\n>> All right.\nThanks for that information, Don.\n\n700\n00:34:27.230 --> 00:34:29.100\nGot anything else for us on this one?\n\n701\n00:34:29.100 --> 00:34:30.400\n>> Just one quick word of caution,\n\n702\n00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:32.658\nwe're gonna do another episode\non the cacheing service.\n\n703\n00:34:32.658 --> 00:34:35.890\nAnd the cacheing service overlaps a little\nbit with the software update service.\n\n704\n00:34:35.890 --> 00:34:37.940\nIn fact, the two are not compatible.\n\n705\n00:34:37.940 --> 00:34:40.760\nYou gotta pick one or\nthe other, you can't have both.\n\n706\n00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:43.440\nSo, I really encourage you\nto watch our cacheing,\n\n707\n00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:44.700\nyou just watched software update.\n\n708\n00:34:44.700 --> 00:34:47.840\nBut watch our cacheing episode cuz that'll\ngive you the information you need to\n\n709\n00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:50.170\npick which one is gonna benefit you.\n\n710\n00:34:50.170 --> 00:34:51.470\nYou absolutely can't have both.\n\n711\n00:34:51.470 --> 00:34:53.010\nThey don't work together.\n\n712\n00:34:53.010 --> 00:34:54.121\nThere's pros and cons to each.\n\n713\n00:34:54.121 --> 00:34:55.750\nI'll explain it all in\nthe cacheing episodes.\n\n714\n00:34:55.750 --> 00:34:56.900\nSo, definitely check that one out.\n\n715\n00:34:56.900 --> 00:34:58.250\n>> Looking forward to seeing that episode.\n\n716\n00:34:58.250 --> 00:35:00.940\nBut we're gonna go ahead and\nsign out for ITProTV.\n\n717\n00:35:00.940 --> 00:35:02.720\nI've been your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n718\n00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:03.470\n>> And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n719\n00:35:03.470 --> 00:35:07.015\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n720\n00:35:07.015 --> 00:35:12.850\n[SOUND]\n\n",

and\n\n3\n00:00:16.317 --> 00:00:20.450\nin today's episode, we're gonna be\nmoving along our Mac Management Basics.\n\n4\n00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:22.950\nWe've got none other than Mr.\nDon Pezet to help us out with that.\n\n5\n00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:24.500\nDon, how are you doing today, sir?\n\n6\n00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:25.270\n>> I'm doing great, Wes,\n\n7\n00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:27.630\nready to jump right back into\nthe world of Mac Management Basics.\n\n8\n00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.710\nIn this episode, we're gonna be kind of\nmoving along from our conversation we\n\n9\n00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:32.460\nhad in our last episode.\n\n10\n00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.940\nIf you didn't watch our last episode,\nit was on the software update service.\n\n11\n00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.910\nNow we can push out\nupdates to our systems.\n\n12\n00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.990\nToday, we're gonna take a look\nat the caching service, and\n\n13\n00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:44.260\nthe caching service is very similar\nto software updates we'll see,\n\n14\n00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.500\nthere's a little bit of\noverlap between the two.\n\n15\n00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.210\nThe comment I made at the end\nof the last episode was\n\n16\n00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.740\nwhen you go to deploy this stuff in\nthe real world, you have to pick\n\n17\n00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.920\nbetween the software update service we\ntalked about in the last episode and\n\n18\n00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.750\nthe caching service we're gonna\ntalk about in this episode.\n\n19\n00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.750\nEach one has their pros and cons,\ntheir benefits and drawbacks, so you've\n\n20\n00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.290\ngotta figure out which one is the most\nrealistic for you and in your environment.\n\n21\n00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:07.980\nSo that's what we're gonna be taking\na look at right here in this episode.\n\n22\n00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:12.620\n>> Don, when it comes to caching,\nin caching platforms in general,\n\n23\n00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.040\nit's about a common set of data\nthat we need access to, and\n\n24\n00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.200\nit can kinda speed up performance and\nstuff.\n\n25\n00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.080\nIs that where we're heading\nwith caching server?\n\n26\n00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.000\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n27\n00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.890\nLet's think in terms of updates,\nI don't wanna pigeonhole us to updates but\n\n28\n00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:24.570\nwe'll start it there.\n\n29\n00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.560\nLet's say that Apple\nreleases a big OS update,\n\n30\n00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.600\nright now, I'm running Mac OS 10.11.3, so\n\n31\n00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.611\nEl Capitan's had three minor revisions and\nI'm on 10.11.3.\n\n32\n00:01:39.611 --> 00:01:45.080\nLet's say tomorrow 10.11.4 comes out and\nthe update is 600 megabytes in size.\n\n33\n00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.240\nThey're usually like 600 to a gig in size,\n\n34\n00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.580\nsomewhere around there but that update\ncomes out and that's the size of it.\n\n35\n00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.520\nMy Mac is gonna reach out to Apple and\ncheck in and say, look,\n\n36\n00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.060\nthere's an update available and it's gonna\ndownload it and it's gonna install it.\n\n37\n00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.710\nThat's fine, that system works great,\nwe don't need to mess with it.\n\n38\n00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.377\nBut what if I had 1,000 Macs?\n\n39\n00:02:04.377 --> 00:02:06.610\nIf I have 1,000 Macs,\n\n40\n00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:12.350\nthey all reach out to Apple, they all see\nthat update and they all download it.\n\n41\n00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:17.410\nWhen they downloaded 1,000 machines\ndownloading 600 megs of data,\n\n42\n00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.740\nyou end up with over terabyte of\ndata that's being transferred,\n\n43\n00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:24.260\nactually several terabytes of data that's\nbeing pulled down and that's a lot.\n\n44\n00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.290\nDepending on your wide area network,\ndepending on your internet connectivity\n\n45\n00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.220\nand other things, it can really affect\nthe performance of your network.\n\n46\n00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:31.640\nWe don't necessarily want that,\n\n47\n00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.230\nespecially since all the machines\nare getting the same data.\n\n48\n00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:39.430\nWhat you said, Wes, is that common set of\ndata, it's one update that's identical for\n\n49\n00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.740\neverybody but\neverybody's downloading it independently.\n\n50\n00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.920\nIn the last episode, we saw where we\ncould use a software update server\n\n51\n00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.040\nwhere you can download that update and\nhave it on your own update server.\n\n52\n00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.730\nAnd then your 1,000 Macs,\n\n53\n00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:55.340\ninstead of them all going out to\nthe internet to get the update,\n\n54\n00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.390\nthey just reach out to the software\nupdate server and they get it from there.\n\n55\n00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:02.190\nNow you have 1,000 Macs that\nall update locally, and\n\n56\n00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.760\nonly the update server goes out to Apple.\n\n57\n00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.540\nNow that works really well, and it has\nthe added benefit of letting us pick and\n\n58\n00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.310\nchoose which updates apply and\nwhich updates don't, so\n\n59\n00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:12.980\nwe get some benefits there.\n\n60\n00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.190\nBut It only works for updates.\n\n61\n00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:18.770\nWhat about other stuff?\n\n62\n00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:22.120\nWhat about apps that I\ninstall from the App Store?\n\n63\n00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.600\nWhat about books that we\npurchase through iBooks?\n\n64\n00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:33.790\nWhat about iOS, the software update\nserver that we saw, that was just for\n\n65\n00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.480\nMac OS updates, for OS 10.\n\n66\n00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.520\nBut what if I have iPads and\niPhones and they've got apps and\n\n67\n00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:44.480\ntheir operating systems, the IOS platform,\nall of those get updated too.\n\n68\n00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.040\nSoftware update server\ndoesn't take care of that.\n\n69\n00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.030\nIt doesn't provide any caching or\ndata reduction for\n\n70\n00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.890\nthose technologies but\ncaching service does.\n\n71\n00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:57.826\nThe caching service can be turned on,\non any Mac OS server.\n\n72\n00:03:57.826 --> 00:04:00.200\nAny OS 10,\nwhere we've installed the server app,\n\n73\n00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:05.880\nwe can turn on caching and that caching\nserver will just watch the network.\n\n74\n00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.450\nAnd the first time somebody\ndownloads something,\n\n75\n00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:10.660\nthe caching server will get a copy of it.\n\n76\n00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:14.190\nAnd then anytime anyone else\ntries to get that file,\n\n77\n00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.030\nthe caching server's already got it and\n\n78\n00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:19.550\nit saves us from having to download\nthose files over and and over again.\n\n79\n00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:22.000\nAnd it goes beyond software updates.\n\n80\n00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.230\nIt does do software updates,\nthe caching server does do that but\n\n81\n00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:29.660\nit also does apps that were purchased\nthrough the App Store, either iOS or\n\n82\n00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:31.380\nMac OS, either of the App Stores.\n\n83\n00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:34.700\nIt does, I already said software updates,\nI'm getting redundant now.\n\n84\n00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:40.070\nIt does iBooks purchases, it does\nthe crazy corporate account type of stuff.\n\n85\n00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:42.370\nIf you've got one of those special\naccounts set up with Apple,\n\n86\n00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:43.210\nif you're school, for\n\n87\n00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:47.090\nexample, you might buy textbooks where\nit rolls out to all the devices.\n\n88\n00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:49.024\nYou gonna cache those too, so\nit caches a lot of things.\n\n89\n00:04:49.024 --> 00:04:50.576\nI feel like I'm leaving something out.\n\n90\n00:04:50.576 --> 00:04:51.940\nWhat am I leaving out?\n\n91\n00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:54.040\nNo, that's pretty much it.\n\n92\n00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:58.650\n[LAUGH] It caches all that stuff,\nand then any time somebody goes\n\n93\n00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:02.860\nto download it again, it's got it\nright there on the caching server.\n\n94\n00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:04.560\nIt could be a software\nupdate that's critical,\n\n95\n00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.340\nthat's really important, or it could\nbe Angry Birds from the iOS App Store.\n\n96\n00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:10.780\nDoesn't matter,\nthey get cached on the caching server.\n\n97\n00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:13.460\nThe second time somebody\ngoes to download it,\n\n98\n00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:14.529\nit pulls right from the caching server.\n\n99\n00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:17.870\nNow, how does this work?\n\n100\n00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:19.630\nIt actually works on a pretty neat system.\n\n101\n00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:23.210\nI told Wes before the show, that usually\nwe have these labs in the show, and\n\n102\n00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:24.550\nI've got all these steps written out.\n\n103\n00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:26.612\nYou guys have probably seen\nthe papers on the desk.\n\n104\n00:05:26.612 --> 00:05:29.340\nNormally, they're just littered\nwith step after step after step for\n\n105\n00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:30.960\nwhat we're going to do in the labs.\n\n106\n00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:34.000\nThe caching server is so\ninsanely easy to turn on though,\n\n107\n00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.620\nthat I don't even have lab\nsteps written down cuz\n\n108\n00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:38.870\nyou really just flip an on switch and\nthe caching service is on.\n\n109\n00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:42.970\nIt's designed to be as\nautomatic as possible,\n\n110\n00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:47.080\nwhich begs the question of if it's\ncompletely automatic, how does it work?\n\n111\n00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:50.740\nWhen we did software updates, we had\nto turn on the software update server.\n\n112\n00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:52.380\nWe had to tell it to download the updates.\n\n113\n00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:55.615\nWe had to approve the updates for\ndistribution.\n\n114\n00:05:55.615 --> 00:05:58.580\nThen we had to go to our clients, we had\nto point the clients to the update server.\n\n115\n00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:01.230\nIt was a very manual process,\nwe had to do all that stuff by hand.\n\n116\n00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:05.720\nBut with the caching server,\nI just flip an on switch.\n\n117\n00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:06.520\nHow does that work?\n\n118\n00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:07.780\nIt works like this.\n\n119\n00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:12.170\nWhen you turn on a caching server, your\ncaching server reaches out to Apple and\n\n120\n00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:16.810\nsays hey, I'm a brand new caching server,\nnice to meet you and Apple says,\n\n121\n00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:17.380\nokay, good.\n\n122\n00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:20.740\nYou're a caching server,\nI'm gonna write down your IP address.\n\n123\n00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:24.010\nIt writes down the public IP\naddress of your caching server.\n\n124\n00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:28.080\nNow normally, you're passing\nthrough a router or a firewall, and\n\n125\n00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:30.750\nyou're going through what's called NAT,\nor network address translation.\n\n126\n00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:33.900\nSo your computer, your caching server,\nprobably has a private address,\n\n127\n00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:36.800\na fake internal address that\nonly works on your network.\n\n128\n00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:39.890\nBut when it goes out to the internet,\nit goes with the real IP,\n\n129\n00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:42.960\nan IP that's being shared by\nthe computers on your network.\n\n130\n00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:49.920\nApple writes that IP down, the real IP,\nand then once it's registered,\n\n131\n00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:55.490\nanyone else that goes to contact Apple,\nApple will look at their IP.\n\n132\n00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:58.950\nIf it sees their IP address matches\nthe caching server's address,\n\n133\n00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:03.640\nif it sees they match, Apple tells that\nclient hey, don't download from me,\n\n134\n00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:05.730\ndownload it from your caching server.\n\n135\n00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:09.370\nThe clients learn about\nthe caching server through Apple.\n\n136\n00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:13.940\nAs long as they share the same IP\naddress as the caching server,\n\n137\n00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:16.890\nthey'll find it automatically and\nthey'll pull their files from there.\n\n138\n00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:19.050\n>> Now that's pretty interesting, Don.\n\n139\n00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:21.980\nI can only imagine that this is\na way you can proactively be\n\n140\n00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:25.807\na little bit easier on your bandwidth\ngoing across those lengths and\n\n141\n00:07:25.807 --> 00:07:27.604\nit's all done in the background for you?\n\n142\n00:07:27.604 --> 00:07:30.690\n>> Yeah, Wes, it's almost deceptively\nsimple, how easy it is to get it going.\n\n143\n00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:32.040\nLet me show you for an example.\n\n144\n00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:33.510\nI'll get this server fired up and\n\n145\n00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:36.940\nwe'll get it turned on and\nthen we get a chance to see it in action.\n\n146\n00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:41.370\nHere I am on a server and\nremember a server is not anything special,\n\n147\n00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:46.390\nit's just a Mac with El Capital installed\nand I have also installed the server app.\n\n148\n00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:49.466\nThat's it, so\nif I take a look at About this Mac,\n\n149\n00:07:49.466 --> 00:07:54.886\nit says I'm running OS 10 El Capitan\n10.11.3 and there it is, up and happy.\n\n150\n00:07:54.886 --> 00:07:59.849\nI'm gonna fire up my server app, and\nactually, before I even do that,\n\n151\n00:07:59.849 --> 00:08:04.812\nOne of the requirements I said was that\nI needed to make sure I had the same\n\n152\n00:08:04.812 --> 00:08:07.080\naddress as my clients, right?\n\n153\n00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:08.750\nMy clients and\nI need to share the same address.\n\n154\n00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:12.190\nWell, let me show you what I meant\nby that before I turn this on.\n\n155\n00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:14.534\nSo I'm gonna go into my\nSystem Preferences here on the server.\n\n156\n00:08:14.534 --> 00:08:16.709\nAnd I'm gonna go into Network.\n\n157\n00:08:16.709 --> 00:08:18.879\nAnd I'm gonna find my Ethernet\nconnection right there.\n\n158\n00:08:18.879 --> 00:08:24.450\nAnd you can see I'm using a DHCP address,\nso I've got 192.168.0.151.\n\n159\n00:08:24.450 --> 00:08:26.870\nThat's my server, right.\n\n160\n00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:30.468\nAnd if I jump over to my client and\nI look over here,\n\n161\n00:08:30.468 --> 00:08:35.783\nI can go into its System Preferences and\ngo into its Ethernet connection,\n\n162\n00:08:35.783 --> 00:08:38.897\nand it's 192.168.0.150.\n\n163\n00:08:38.897 --> 00:08:40.610\nThey don't match, right.\n\n164\n00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:43.430\nWell, that make sense cuz you can't\nhave two computers on the same\n\n165\n00:08:43.430 --> 00:08:44.270\nnetwork with the same IP.\n\n166\n00:08:44.270 --> 00:08:44.890\nYou can't do it.\n\n167\n00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:47.120\nIt would be like two people\nhaving the same cellphone number.\n\n168\n00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:47.659\nYou can't do that.\n\n169\n00:08:47.659 --> 00:08:48.942\nThere's no way to tell them apart.\n\n170\n00:08:48.942 --> 00:08:53.630\nThese clients have to have\ndifferent IPs on the local network.\n\n171\n00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:55.580\nBut remember I mentioned that\nwe're passing through a router or\n\n172\n00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:57.270\nwe're passing through a firewall.\n\n173\n00:08:57.270 --> 00:09:02.612\nWhen you see an IP address like this,\nif it starts with 192.168,\n\n174\n00:09:02.612 --> 00:09:07.429\nor if it starts with 10., or\nif it starts with 172.16 all\n\n175\n00:09:07.429 --> 00:09:11.830\nthe way through 172.31,\nthose are fake addresses.\n\n176\n00:09:11.830 --> 00:09:13.020\nI shouldn't say they're fake.\n\n177\n00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:14.970\nThey're private addresses.\n\n178\n00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:19.410\nThere's a RFC, it's RFC 1918 for people\nwho get bored and love to read that stuff,\n\n179\n00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:23.890\nthat identifies addresses that are only\nusable on your own private network.\n\n180\n00:09:23.890 --> 00:09:26.190\nAnd this IP, the IP that I've got here,\nis one of those.\n\n181\n00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:27.370\nIt's on my private network.\n\n182\n00:09:27.370 --> 00:09:30.110\nThese IPs are not allowed\nout on the Internet.\n\n183\n00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:33.260\nSo if I go to the Internet using this IP,\nmy traffic gets dropped.\n\n184\n00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.210\nThen I can't talk to anybody.\n\n185\n00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:40.170\nSo I pass through a router, or I pass\nthrough a firewall, and that firewall is\n\n186\n00:09:40.170 --> 00:09:45.120\nchanging my IP address into a public,\nreal address.\n\n187\n00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:46.840\nAnd that's happening behind the scenes.\n\n188\n00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:48.430\nYour end users don't see that.\n\n189\n00:09:48.430 --> 00:09:50.940\nSo, for example, if I take my server,\n\n190\n00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:56.110\nand I'm just gonna fire up Safari,\nand I'm gonna browse to a website.\n\n191\n00:09:56.110 --> 00:09:57.377\nLet's see,\nwhat website do I want to use today?\n\n192\n00:09:57.377 --> 00:09:59.142\nWe'll use IP Chicken.\n\n193\n00:09:59.142 --> 00:10:01.216\nSo I'm gonna go to ipchicken.com, and\n\n194\n00:10:01.216 --> 00:10:04.638\nit's just a simple website that\ntells you what your IP address is.\n\n195\n00:10:04.638 --> 00:10:11.958\nAnd see how it's showing me here,\nmy current IP address is 209.251.159.179.\n\n196\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:16.129\nBut we just saw my address\nwas 192.160.0.151.\n\n197\n00:10:16.129 --> 00:10:17.018\nWhat's happening?\n\n198\n00:10:17.018 --> 00:10:19.670\nWell, I'm getting\ntranslated on the way out.\n\n199\n00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:24.205\nAnd by the time I get to Apple, this is\nthe address that Apple is going to see.\n\n200\n00:10:24.205 --> 00:10:27.420\nOkay, now I brought it up\nhere through IP Chicken.\n\n201\n00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:29.541\nYou can actually see it\nin the server app too.\n\n202\n00:10:29.541 --> 00:10:34.010\nSo if I go into the server app, which\napparently I have never launched before.\n\n203\n00:10:34.010 --> 00:10:38.438\nSo, if I get into the server app it will\nactually show me what my public address\n\n204\n00:10:38.438 --> 00:10:40.330\nis; and it's right in there.\n\n205\n00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:43.480\nBut, that doesn't help us on a client\nwhere you don't have the server app.\n\n206\n00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:44.640\nI don't have the server app here,\n\n207\n00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:46.770\nso it's hard for me to launch that and\nsee what my public address is.\n\n208\n00:10:46.770 --> 00:10:48.540\nSo it's easier to use\nthose external sites.\n\n209\n00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:50.149\nAnd so\nI'll do the same thing here on this one.\n\n210\n00:10:50.149 --> 00:10:52.927\nI'm gonna go to IP Chicken, or\nif you don't like chickens,\n\n211\n00:10:52.927 --> 00:10:55.766\nyou can do ipmonkey.com,\nthat's one of the ones out there.\n\n212\n00:10:55.766 --> 00:11:00.130\nAnd I can see right there,\nsame thing, 209.251.159.179.\n\n213\n00:11:00.130 --> 00:11:04.260\nSo I've got different internal IPs,\nbut my public IP,\n\n214\n00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:07.650\nby the time I make it out there\non the Internet, is the same.\n\n215\n00:11:07.650 --> 00:11:11.720\nSo when we get to Apple,\nApple is gonna see my client and\n\n216\n00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:13.800\nmy server as having the same IP address.\n\n217\n00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:17.660\nThat's important because what happens,\nthis is a laptop.\n\n218\n00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:20.372\nSo what happens if I take my laptop and\nI go home?\n\n219\n00:11:20.372 --> 00:11:22.310\nI can't communicate with\nmy caching server anymore.\n\n220\n00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:26.140\nThe caching server is back in the office,\nso I need to stop using it, right?\n\n221\n00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:27.310\nSo that's why Apple does that.\n\n222\n00:11:27.310 --> 00:11:30.240\nThey make sure that you show up\nwith the same address, all right?\n\n223\n00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:31.730\nThen you'll start using\nthat caching server.\n\n224\n00:11:32.910 --> 00:11:37.720\nAll right, well back on my server here,\nit's still firing up.\n\n225\n00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:39.910\nThe first time you fire up the server app,\nit takes awhile cuz you've got to\n\n226\n00:11:39.910 --> 00:11:41.860\ninitialize each of those\ndifferent applications.\n\n227\n00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:44.570\nSo it's getting started with that and\ngetting set up.\n\n228\n00:11:44.570 --> 00:11:46.570\nNow, on this one,\nonce the server app is up,\n\n229\n00:11:46.570 --> 00:11:49.850\nwhat I'm gonna do, is I'm gonna\ngo into the caching service, and\n\n230\n00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:52.900\nthe caching service is one of\nthe basic services in the server app.\n\n231\n00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:54.630\nSo it's not even tucked\naway under advanced like we\n\n232\n00:11:54.630 --> 00:11:56.080\nsaw some of the other stuff.\n\n233\n00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:59.270\nAnd, unlike a lot of the other services,\n\n234\n00:11:59.270 --> 00:12:01.710\nthe configuration on this\none is extremely minimal.\n\n235\n00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:02.240\nThere we go.\n\n236\n00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:03.600\nSo mine just fired up.\n\n237\n00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:08.372\nSo here we go, and notice in the server\napp right here on the front it\n\n238\n00:12:08.372 --> 00:12:13.079\nsays Internet Reachable\nat 209.251.159.179.\n\n239\n00:12:13.079 --> 00:12:16.953\nSo on the server, I don't need IP chicken,\nor IP monkey, or IP whatever,\n\n240\n00:12:16.953 --> 00:12:18.119\nipmarsupial.com-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n241\n00:12:18.119 --> 00:12:19.363\n>> Is that taken?\n\n242\n00:12:19.363 --> 00:12:20.074\n>> Some animal.\n\n243\n00:12:20.074 --> 00:12:21.450\n>> Yeah, [LAUGH] I don't need all that.\n\n244\n00:12:21.450 --> 00:12:24.010\nI can just see it right here on a client,\nit's a little bit harder.\n\n245\n00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:28.320\nBut, the server is up, and\nthe caching service is right here.\n\n246\n00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:32.650\nNow, normally, when I go into a service,\nlike if I go into mail or messages or\n\n247\n00:12:32.650 --> 00:12:35.620\nwhatever, see you've got all\nthese settings and options and\n\n248\n00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:37.070\nstuff that we can tweak.\n\n249\n00:12:37.070 --> 00:12:41.350\nWhen we go to the caching server, there's\nnot a whole lot that you can tweak.\n\n250\n00:12:41.350 --> 00:12:43.580\nThe caching server is really,\nreally simple.\n\n251\n00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:48.820\nIn fact, if you just flip the switch\nto ON, that's typically all it takes.\n\n252\n00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:50.780\nRight there, the caching server's\nnow running and you're done.\n\n253\n00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:51.659\nYou can walk away.\n\n254\n00:12:51.659 --> 00:12:54.199\nAll right, everything else on\nhere is completely optional.\n\n255\n00:12:54.199 --> 00:12:57.970\nYou don't necessarily have to\nmess with it unless you want to.\n\n256\n00:12:57.970 --> 00:13:00.530\nSo let's run through these options and\nkind of talk about what they are.\n\n257\n00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:05.550\nFirst off, permissions, who do I want\nto allow to use the caching server?\n\n258\n00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:09.200\nThe default is that it's Local Subnets, so\nother people on the same local network as\n\n259\n00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:11.870\nyou are allowed to use this caching\nserver, and that's what most of us want.\n\n260\n00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:12.456\nBut you can tweak that.\n\n261\n00:13:12.456 --> 00:13:15.559\nYou might have some subnets you\nwant to use the caching server and\n\n262\n00:13:15.559 --> 00:13:19.122\nsome subnets that you don't, some people\nyou might want to go right out or\n\n263\n00:13:19.122 --> 00:13:21.680\nyou might want to block or deny.\n\n264\n00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:23.620\nThen we've got the Cache Location.\n\n265\n00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:27.150\nThe cache, it's files,\nright, downloaded files, and\n\n266\n00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:29.130\nsome of them can be pretty large.\n\n267\n00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:31.310\nAnd it can start to fill up\nyour hard drive over time.\n\n268\n00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:34.040\nSo on your server you've only got so\nmuch storage right?\n\n269\n00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:38.250\nSo if I go to my server here, and I go\nto Storage, I can see that I've only got\n\n270\n00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:42.570\nlooks like, I don't know how big this hard\ndrive is, 30 gigs or something like that.\n\n271\n00:13:42.570 --> 00:13:44.580\nSo it says I've got 30 gigs available.\n\n272\n00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:45.360\nThere we go.\n\n273\n00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:47.310\nSo I've got 30 gigs of storage available.\n\n274\n00:13:47.310 --> 00:13:49.900\nWhat if I wanna cache more\nthan 30 gigs of data?\n\n275\n00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:53.680\nI might want to attach an external drive,\nor an additional hard drive to the system.\n\n276\n00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:57.640\nAnd so back under Caching, I can change\nlocation and put the cache on a different\n\n277\n00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:00.400\ndrive if I want, all right,\nso a couple of things there.\n\n278\n00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:02.050\nAfter that I've got the Cache Size.\n\n279\n00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:03.770\nThe Cache Size right now is unlimited.\n\n280\n00:14:03.770 --> 00:14:06.830\nAnd you've gotta be careful with\nthat especially if you're using your\n\n281\n00:14:06.830 --> 00:14:10.320\nMacintosh HD because I could fill up\nmy system drive and that would be bad.\n\n282\n00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:12.160\nSo we probably wanna put a limit on it.\n\n283\n00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:15.870\nI'm gonna limit mine to 25 gigs, right,\n\n284\n00:14:15.870 --> 00:14:18.510\nthe smallest setting it'll let me go,\n25 gigs.\n\n285\n00:14:18.510 --> 00:14:23.305\nSo by limiting it to that, I'm gonna start\ncaching files, but if I get over 25 gigs,\n\n286\n00:14:23.305 --> 00:14:24.830\nwhat happens?\n\n287\n00:14:24.830 --> 00:14:27.660\nIt deletes old stuff to make room for\nnew stuff.\n\n288\n00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:30.327\nSo it's automatically gonna cycle\nout old things that it thinks aren't\n\n289\n00:14:30.327 --> 00:14:30.991\nneeded anymore.\n\n290\n00:14:30.991 --> 00:14:33.498\nIt bumps those out and\nmakes room for the new stuff.\n\n291\n00:14:33.498 --> 00:14:37.996\nNow, 25 gigs might sound like a lot,\nand if we're talking software updates,\n\n292\n00:14:37.996 --> 00:14:38.666\nit is a lot.\n\n293\n00:14:38.666 --> 00:14:43.064\nBut if you're talking about iBooks,\nand especially IOS apps,\n\n294\n00:14:43.064 --> 00:14:46.578\nsome of those IOS apps add up really,\nreally fast.\n\n295\n00:14:46.578 --> 00:14:48.618\nThere's many, many IOS apps,\n\n296\n00:14:48.618 --> 00:14:52.864\nI know a lot of schools use\nEndless Alphabet, and Endless Reader.\n\n297\n00:14:52.864 --> 00:14:53.885\nThose Endless apps,\n\n298\n00:14:53.885 --> 00:14:57.185\nthey're a gig each once you get all\nthe voice files loaded into them.\n\n299\n00:14:57.185 --> 00:15:00.536\nAnd so that adds up really fast,\nand you'll want more space.\n\n300\n00:15:00.536 --> 00:15:02.090\nAnd that's where an external drive or\n\n301\n00:15:02.090 --> 00:15:04.137\nsome other kind of storage\nreally comes in handy.\n\n302\n00:15:04.137 --> 00:15:07.735\n>> Now Don, one of the things you talked\nabout in software, your software updates,\n\n303\n00:15:07.735 --> 00:15:10.100\nright, you had to go in there,\nvery manual process.\n\n304\n00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:13.210\nYou would see the updates that you\nwanted to push out to the machines, but\n\n305\n00:15:13.210 --> 00:15:14.230\nyou had to do a couple of things, right?\n\n306\n00:15:14.230 --> 00:15:17.142\nYou had to approve or deny them\nbefore they would be made available,\n\n307\n00:15:17.142 --> 00:15:18.789\nobviously setting up the client too.\n\n308\n00:15:18.789 --> 00:15:20.580\nNow, what do we have here?\n\n309\n00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:23.420\nWe got Apple software updates,\niOS software updates,\n\n310\n00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:26.570\nMac, Apple Store, iBooks,\nwhole bunch of stuff.\n\n311\n00:15:26.570 --> 00:15:29.000\nSo are we gonna approve and deny these?\n\n312\n00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.870\n>> Well, you might have noticed as I\nwas here in the configuration utility,\n\n313\n00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:34.930\nI don't have any other options, right?\n\n314\n00:15:34.930 --> 00:15:37.800\nLet's go back to the update server.\n\n315\n00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:42.580\nSo when we did Software Update back here,\nI had my Settings.\n\n316\n00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:45.195\nAnd then under Updates I would\nget the big list of updates, and\n\n317\n00:15:45.195 --> 00:15:47.167\nremember I can approve and\ndeny them, right?\n\n318\n00:15:47.167 --> 00:15:50.438\nYou can enable them and remove them,\nso we've got that Enable option and\n\n319\n00:15:50.438 --> 00:15:51.250\nDisable option.\n\n320\n00:15:51.250 --> 00:15:52.280\nWe can turn them on and off.\n\n321\n00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:54.160\nSo you pick and choose what rolls out.\n\n322\n00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:56.378\nWith the caching server,\nyou don't have that.\n\n323\n00:15:56.378 --> 00:15:59.083\nWhen I go back to my caching server,\nthere is no other tab up here.\n\n324\n00:15:59.083 --> 00:16:02.624\nThere's just these options,\nand that's it, nothing else.\n\n325\n00:16:02.624 --> 00:16:04.622\nWhat's that all about?\n\n326\n00:16:04.622 --> 00:16:08.190\nWell, caching server is\ndesigned to be dead simple.\n\n327\n00:16:08.190 --> 00:16:09.210\nSuper easy.\n\n328\n00:16:09.210 --> 00:16:10.820\nYou turn it on, and you walk away, and\n\n329\n00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:14.050\nthat's the end of it; that's\nwhat it's designed for, right?\n\n330\n00:16:14.050 --> 00:16:16.960\nSo it doesn't give us\nthat granular control.\n\n331\n00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:19.990\nAnd more importantly, it can actually\nruin things for us a little bit\n\n332\n00:16:19.990 --> 00:16:23.165\nbecause you can't use the caching server\nwith the software updates server.\n\n333\n00:16:23.165 --> 00:16:25.030\nCuz the caching server is\ngonna get all the updates,\n\n334\n00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:27.500\nit's gonna get everything that\neverybody else downloads, right?\n\n335\n00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:28.800\nAnd it's gonna cache those.\n\n336\n00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:30.700\nBut if it's the software update\nserver that's going out and\n\n337\n00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:33.420\ndownloading the updates,\nit bypasses the caching server.\n\n338\n00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:35.150\nAnd then it serves that\nstuff up to the clients, and\n\n339\n00:16:35.150 --> 00:16:37.790\nthen again, bypasses the caching server.\n\n340\n00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:40.630\nSo, you got to pick one or the other,\nwhich one's more valuable.\n\n341\n00:16:40.630 --> 00:16:42.720\nIf you need that granular control,\n\n342\n00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:46.210\nlike Wes was asking about,\nthen you need the software update server.\n\n343\n00:16:46.210 --> 00:16:48.340\nBut if you're just trying\nto save bandwidth,\n\n344\n00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:49.520\nthen you need the caching server.\n\n345\n00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:52.450\nThey're designed for\na different solution, different problem.\n\n346\n00:16:52.450 --> 00:16:55.150\n>> So the software updater,\nyou can pick and choose.\n\n347\n00:16:55.150 --> 00:16:56.920\nThe caching server, all or nothing.\n\n348\n00:16:56.920 --> 00:17:02.150\n>> That's it, yep, and there's no way that\nI'm aware of to change that behavior.\n\n349\n00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:04.920\nAnd in fact, if you do software\nupdate server, you can tell it hey,\n\n350\n00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:06.230\nenable everything.\n\n351\n00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:10.516\nAnd now, it's kind of doing everything but\neverything to the update software server\n\n352\n00:17:10.516 --> 00:17:13.387\nis just updates, not iBooks,\nnot apps, not iOS at all.\n\n353\n00:17:13.387 --> 00:17:16.096\nCaching server is those other things,\nright?\n\n354\n00:17:16.096 --> 00:17:19.444\nSo that's where I said in the last episode\nyou gotta pick which one of these you\n\n355\n00:17:19.444 --> 00:17:20.530\nreally want.\n\n356\n00:17:20.530 --> 00:17:22.040\nDo you wanna say bandwidth?\n\n357\n00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:24.580\nOr do you wanna control deployment, right?\n\n358\n00:17:24.580 --> 00:17:26.089\nSoftware update lets\nyou control deployment.\n\n359\n00:17:27.150 --> 00:17:29.110\nNow, once we get this thing set up and\n\n360\n00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:33.620\nin place, well, it's turned on and\nit's running, we're done.\n\n361\n00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:35.390\nWell, how do we know if it's working?\n\n362\n00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:37.790\nKinda tricky, right?\n\n363\n00:17:37.790 --> 00:17:39.570\nBecause I don't necessarily know.\n\n364\n00:17:39.570 --> 00:17:41.690\nThis is completely\ninvisible to the clients.\n\n365\n00:17:41.690 --> 00:17:44.040\nThe client knows that\nthere's a caching server.\n\n366\n00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:46.530\nWhen I turn this thing on,\nwhen I flip that on switch,\n\n367\n00:17:46.530 --> 00:17:50.090\nwe registered with Apple and now,\nany of my clients that go out and\n\n368\n00:17:50.090 --> 00:17:52.370\ndownload updates and\nthings they're going to see that.\n\n369\n00:17:52.370 --> 00:17:55.390\nSo if I go to, let's see,\nlet's go to my logs.\n\n370\n00:17:55.390 --> 00:17:57.100\nWe'll see if anything pops up in the logs.\n\n371\n00:17:57.100 --> 00:17:59.760\nThe logs are really one of the only\nplaces you can go to see anything\n\n372\n00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:02.220\nabout the caching service.\n\n373\n00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:03.710\nSo I'm just go here to my logs and\n\n374\n00:18:03.710 --> 00:18:07.669\nI'm gonna find the caching service,\nright here and go into its service log.\n\n375\n00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:13.460\nAnd not a whole lot to be found in here,\nbut you'll see Caching Server started.\n\n376\n00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:16.910\nFailed to load optimized model at path,\nblah, blah, blah,\n\n377\n00:18:16.910 --> 00:18:18.200\nI'm not quite sure what that one is.\n\n378\n00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:22.320\nSome kind of AssetCache problem,\nprobably because it was brand new, so\n\n379\n00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:23.550\nit didn't have the AssetCache.\n\n380\n00:18:23.550 --> 00:18:25.730\nSo it more than likely created that,\nbut this is the important one.\n\n381\n00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:29.090\nThis is what I was looking for\nright here, Registration succeeded.\n\n382\n00:18:29.090 --> 00:18:30.387\nWhat does it mean, registration?\n\n383\n00:18:30.387 --> 00:18:32.097\nWe've registered with Apple.\n\n384\n00:18:32.097 --> 00:18:35.340\nWe've registered with Apple,\nand we're now good to go.\n\n385\n00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:39.900\nAnd clients that start looking for\nthe server, will find it.\n\n386\n00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:41.820\nWhen the client goes to download\nsomething, it will ask Apple,\n\n387\n00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:43.190\nhey do I have an attaching server?\n\n388\n00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:44.500\nAnd Apple will tell them yes or no.\n\n389\n00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:47.880\n>> So, at this point Don, it's reached out\nto Apple, Apple has said, okay, we see\n\n390\n00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:51.710\nyour public IP address, we're gonna put\nthat in our probably database somewhere.\n\n391\n00:18:51.710 --> 00:18:55.580\nScratch it down on a Post-it note, and\nthen when your clients connect out,\n\n392\n00:18:55.580 --> 00:18:58.840\nthey're gonna notice that that\ncaching server is recognized and say,\n\n393\n00:18:58.840 --> 00:18:59.970\nhey, you don't come to us.\n\n394\n00:18:59.970 --> 00:19:01.400\nSo you're gonna stay on your internal LAN.\n\n395\n00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:02.510\n>> Yeah, that's basically it.\n\n396\n00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:06.030\nAnd if I jump over, I'll take a client and\nso, I'm on my client.\n\n397\n00:19:06.030 --> 00:19:09.220\nI'm just gonna jump into the App Store,\nand let's see if I have any updates.\n\n398\n00:19:09.220 --> 00:19:12.773\nI can't remember if I did all\nthe updates for this machine.\n\n399\n00:19:12.773 --> 00:19:14.757\nShoot, I must have automatic\nupdates turned on,\n\n400\n00:19:14.757 --> 00:19:18.440\nI knew this update had just come out a few\nday ago, and I've already got it applied.\n\n401\n00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:22.557\nSo there's no updates available for\nme right now, I guess I could probably.\n\n402\n00:19:22.557 --> 00:19:26.620\nLet's download something, maybe not\nLego Avengers, let's find something free.\n\n403\n00:19:26.620 --> 00:19:31.595\nSo if we go and download something on an\niBook, an update, those types of things.\n\n404\n00:19:31.595 --> 00:19:33.012\nThose are going to get cached.\n\n405\n00:19:33.012 --> 00:19:36.160\nNow I can't just go to the web and\nthen download a file there.\n\n406\n00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:37.740\nThat doesn't use the caching server,\nright?\n\n407\n00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:40.650\nSo it's gotta be done\nthrough Apple Services,\n\n408\n00:19:40.650 --> 00:19:43.070\notherwise it doesn't know\nto use the caching server.\n\n409\n00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:45.138\nSo, let's see, let's find something free.\n\n410\n00:19:45.138 --> 00:19:47.886\nI'm gonna go to Great Free Apps & Games.\n\n411\n00:19:47.886 --> 00:19:49.190\nHere, we'll get Twitter.\n\n412\n00:19:49.190 --> 00:19:50.556\nSo I'm gonna download Twitter, all right?\n\n413\n00:19:50.556 --> 00:19:53.529\nSo, we'll go ahead and\ninstall that app, and\n\n414\n00:19:53.529 --> 00:19:56.512\nit wants our password\nwhich I might remember.\n\n415\n00:19:56.512 --> 00:20:01.261\nLet's see if I do and\n[LAUGH] there we go, all right.\n\n416\n00:20:01.261 --> 00:20:03.473\nSo, it's gonna download and\ninstall that app.\n\n417\n00:20:03.473 --> 00:20:07.030\nNow, what's gonna happen is when it goes\nto download it, it knows this caching\n\n418\n00:20:07.030 --> 00:20:10.554\nserver and so it's gonna ask the caching\nserver, hey, do you have this file?\n\n419\n00:20:10.554 --> 00:20:13.346\nAnd my caching server's gonna say,\nno, I'm sorry I don't.\n\n420\n00:20:13.346 --> 00:20:16.920\nAnd so, then we're gonna say, no big deal,\nwe're gonna go and download it.\n\n421\n00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:20.580\nAnd when we download it, it's gonna\ngo on the caching server as well,\n\n422\n00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:22.180\nas my own machine.\n\n423\n00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:26.300\nAnd so, we're gonna get it, and\nit'll be stored in both places.\n\n424\n00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:30.810\nNow, it seems to be taking its time,\nI I'm pretty sure I put the right\n\n425\n00:20:30.810 --> 00:20:34.610\npassword in [LAUGH] that's my biggest\nchallenge is remembering my own password.\n\n426\n00:20:34.610 --> 00:20:36.715\nSo let's see if there's any\nactivity back over here.\n\n427\n00:20:36.715 --> 00:20:40.980\nNo, no, no crazy activity here,\nthis ones just kind of sitting by.\n\n428\n00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:42.760\nWhile we wait on that\none to sort itself out,\n\n429\n00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:45.030\nlet me show you a few more\nthings about the caching server.\n\n430\n00:20:45.030 --> 00:20:47.429\nVerifying its operation is\nkind of the tough part.\n\n431\n00:20:47.429 --> 00:20:50.334\nThe cache is stored right on the drive\nthough, and you can go in there and\n\n432\n00:20:50.334 --> 00:20:53.130\nkind of you look at it and\nsee if there's anything in it.\n\n433\n00:20:53.130 --> 00:20:57.235\nThe cache is protected and that's\nimportant because lets say you cache\n\n434\n00:20:57.235 --> 00:21:01.972\na file somebody malicious comes in and\nmodified that file in your caching server.\n\n435\n00:21:01.972 --> 00:21:05.661\nYou can start serving up malware right out\nof your own caching server that could be\n\n436\n00:21:05.661 --> 00:21:07.137\nbad but the cache is protected.\n\n437\n00:21:07.137 --> 00:21:10.776\nBut if we drop into our terminal,\nwe can kind of see you in a little bit so\n\n438\n00:21:10.776 --> 00:21:13.263\nI'm just gonna zoom in\non this little bit here.\n\n439\n00:21:13.263 --> 00:21:20.890\nSo the cache it actually\nstored in /Library /Server.\n\n440\n00:21:20.890 --> 00:21:23.790\nLet me get into the right place here.\n\n441\n00:21:23.790 --> 00:21:29.660\nSo it's stored in\n/Library/server/caching and\n\n442\n00:21:29.660 --> 00:21:34.110\nin there, is where you'll see\nyour config and your data, right?\n\n443\n00:21:34.110 --> 00:21:35.030\nWell, and the logs, too, right?\n\n444\n00:21:35.030 --> 00:21:36.900\nThe config, that's the configuration for\nthe caching server,\n\n445\n00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:39.720\nwhich we already know is\nnot very complex at all.\n\n446\n00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:43.000\nAnd then the data,\nthat’s our actual cache and then the logs,\n\n447\n00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.270\nthat’s what I’m viewing in the server app.\n\n448\n00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:49.710\nSo, if I get into that data folder,\nI can see all the data it's cached, right?\n\n449\n00:21:49.710 --> 00:21:52.420\nWell, not exactly, Permission denied.\n\n450\n00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:57.440\nIt is restricted, but you can do\na little sudo to get around that and\n\n451\n00:21:57.440 --> 00:21:59.480\nstart to look into that folder.\n\n452\n00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:00.790\nApple just protects it\nagain cuz they wanna\n\n453\n00:22:00.790 --> 00:22:03.250\nmake sure that somebody doesn't get\nin there and start modifying things.\n\n454\n00:22:03.250 --> 00:22:07.440\nAnd what we're gonna see,\nis at a minimum these three files, right.\n\n455\n00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:10.540\nAnd what these three files\nare is the asset info database.\n\n456\n00:22:10.540 --> 00:22:13.530\nSo I've got a database of all\nthe stuff that's being cached.\n\n457\n00:22:13.530 --> 00:22:15.980\nNow normally, you'll see this database and\n\n458\n00:22:15.980 --> 00:22:20.140\nyou'll see some other folders\nwhere your actual cached data is.\n\n459\n00:22:20.140 --> 00:22:22.721\nIn my case, I just see\nthe database file and that's it.\n\n460\n00:22:22.721 --> 00:22:24.584\nAnd so that's what's telling me,\n\n461\n00:22:24.584 --> 00:22:27.887\nI haven't cached anything like\nthere's nothing cached yet.\n\n462\n00:22:27.887 --> 00:22:29.310\nI don't have anything.\n\n463\n00:22:29.310 --> 00:22:30.770\nI just have the database.\n\n464\n00:22:30.770 --> 00:22:33.320\nAnd some of these other\nones like the SHM file,\n\n465\n00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:37.270\nwe're actually doing hashes of the file,\nso that we can identify what they are.\n\n466\n00:22:37.270 --> 00:22:38.700\nWhen somebody goes and download a file,\n\n467\n00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:41.620\nthey get a hash from Apple that says\nthis is the file you're looking for.\n\n468\n00:22:41.620 --> 00:22:44.290\nAnd we can send that hash up\nto the caching server here and\n\n469\n00:22:44.290 --> 00:22:46.220\nit just looks to see if that hash matches.\n\n470\n00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:49.900\nThat way if it's a gig file,\nI don't have to have all\n\n471\n00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:53.090\none gigabyte of it to be able to compare\nand make sure this is the right one.\n\n472\n00:22:53.090 --> 00:22:57.080\nI can just do a simple hash that's\nusually less than one K in size, very,\n\n473\n00:22:57.080 --> 00:22:58.620\nvery small, all right.\n\n474\n00:22:58.620 --> 00:22:59.680\nSo check in on the client here,\n\n475\n00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:02.770\nand sure enough I get Twitter\nnow shows as Open, right?\n\n476\n00:23:02.770 --> 00:23:04.740\nSo Twitter has installed.\n\n477\n00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:08.179\nAnd I know that I reached out to Apple and\nI was able to download that.\n\n478\n00:23:08.179 --> 00:23:09.929\nBut did it get cached?\n\n479\n00:23:09.929 --> 00:23:11.050\nI don't know.\n\n480\n00:23:11.050 --> 00:23:13.000\nRemember, we didn't change\nanything in our client.\n\n481\n00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:13.950\nThere's no setting.\n\n482\n00:23:13.950 --> 00:23:14.600\nNo option.\n\n483\n00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:15.290\nNo preference.\n\n484\n00:23:15.290 --> 00:23:18.670\nWe didn't do a darn thing on this\nclient other than just go out and\n\n485\n00:23:18.670 --> 00:23:20.430\nsaw an app like normal, right?\n\n486\n00:23:20.430 --> 00:23:21.387\nDid it get cached?\n\n487\n00:23:21.387 --> 00:23:23.849\nWell, let's zoom back up over\nto the server and remember,\n\n488\n00:23:23.849 --> 00:23:25.929\nright here I was watching that database,\nright?\n\n489\n00:23:25.929 --> 00:23:30.640\nAnd that's all I've got is a database,\nwell, this is the moment of truth Wes.\n\n490\n00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:32.080\nIf I just see the database then no,\n\n491\n00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:35.736\nmy caching server's broken,\nhopefully, there we go.\n\n492\n00:23:35.736 --> 00:23:38.720\n[LAUGH] The moment of IT hesitation there.\n\n493\n00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:43.990\nSo looking at it, I can see I've got\na little more in that folder now.\n\n494\n00:23:43.990 --> 00:23:47.880\nI had just a database, right,\nmy AssetInfo database.\n\n495\n00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:52.410\nNow I've got a new folder\nwith this long crazy name.\n\n496\n00:23:52.410 --> 00:23:53.450\nWhat's that name?\n\n497\n00:23:53.450 --> 00:23:54.905\nWell, that's a GUID.\n\n498\n00:23:54.905 --> 00:23:59.877\nIt's a global unique identifier that\nidentifies this particular file that\n\n499\n00:23:59.877 --> 00:24:03.914\nwe've just cached,\nwhich I assume is Twitter [LAUGH] itself,\n\n500\n00:24:03.914 --> 00:24:07.953\ncuz it doesn't say Twitter,\nit says But it's a directory and\n\n501\n00:24:07.953 --> 00:24:13.340\nthe reason it's a directory is that an app\nis usually made up of more than one file.\n\n502\n00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:16.830\nAnd so each of the pieces of that\napp are being cached into there.\n\n503\n00:24:16.830 --> 00:24:17.940\nAnd so if I wanna try and\n\n504\n00:24:17.940 --> 00:24:22.210\nlook inside of it,\nis it going to let me look inside of it?\n\n505\n00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:26.540\nIt's gonna be a little protected here.\n\n506\n00:24:26.540 --> 00:24:31.050\nAgain, they wanna make sure that you\ndon't mess with the updates and so\n\n507\n00:24:31.050 --> 00:24:33.620\nit is all kind of protected in there.\n\n508\n00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:38.860\nAnd as I kinda drill down into it,\nlet's see, there's the actual asset cache.\n\n509\n00:24:38.860 --> 00:24:41.200\nAnd that file size,\nI guess that's about right.\n\n510\n00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:44.180\nSo here's the actual asset cache file.\n\n511\n00:24:44.180 --> 00:24:48.270\nAnd you can see that it is\nabout 4 MB in size, right?\n\n512\n00:24:48.270 --> 00:24:50.410\nSo 4.8 MB right there.\n\n513\n00:24:50.410 --> 00:24:53.660\nThat's the Twitter application that\ngot cached and it's stored here.\n\n514\n00:24:53.660 --> 00:24:55.890\nIf I jump back to my server app,\n\n515\n00:24:55.890 --> 00:24:59.250\nI can see something a little more\nreadable here in the logs, right?\n\n516\n00:24:59.250 --> 00:25:04.070\nSo the last time I was here we had stopped\nright here, registration succeeded.\n\n517\n00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:06.730\nBut now as we look at it,\nhere's a get request.\n\n518\n00:25:06.730 --> 00:25:09.792\nWe received a get request\nfrom MacAppStore/2.1.\n\n519\n00:25:09.792 --> 00:25:13.452\nWell that's my laptop reaching out\ntrying to get Twitter, right, and\n\n520\n00:25:13.452 --> 00:25:14.800\nI'm requesting a file.\n\n521\n00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:18.010\nHere's the file that I wanted, and\nit's an encrypted package, right,\n\n522\n00:25:18.010 --> 00:25:21.180\nbecause Apple distributes this stuff\nencrypted so you can't tamper with it.\n\n523\n00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:25.912\nAnd then we see served all 4.8\nmegabytes of 4.8 megabytes,\n\n524\n00:25:25.912 --> 00:25:32.550\n0 bytes from cache, 4.8 megabytes\nfrom Internet, zero bytes from peers.\n\n525\n00:25:32.550 --> 00:25:33.800\nWhat does that mean?\n\n526\n00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:37.810\nWell, when we cache something,\nif it's not there,\n\n527\n00:25:37.810 --> 00:25:41.910\nif I don't have it in the cache it's\nnot the client that reaches out,\n\n528\n00:25:41.910 --> 00:25:44.230\nit's actually the caching serving\nthat reaches out and downloads it.\n\n529\n00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:47.100\nSo the caching server went to\nthe internet and got a copy of it and\n\n530\n00:25:47.100 --> 00:25:48.510\nhanded it over to the client.\n\n531\n00:25:48.510 --> 00:25:51.310\nOkay, now what about this peers part?\n\n532\n00:25:51.310 --> 00:25:54.103\nI understand the server's involved, and I\nunderstand the client is downloading, but\n\n533\n00:25:54.103 --> 00:25:54.985\nwhat does he mean by peers?\n\n534\n00:25:54.985 --> 00:25:59.360\nYour caching server isn't the only\nplace that things can get cached.\n\n535\n00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:02.090\nYour clients can cache data too,\nand in fact, they do.\n\n536\n00:26:02.090 --> 00:26:06.690\nThere may be times where one of your\nclients already has something cached, and\n\n537\n00:26:06.690 --> 00:26:08.520\nit's just not on the caching server.\n\n538\n00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:11.420\nYou can actually serve\nthat up from up here.\n\n539\n00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:13.670\nOr from another caching\nserver on the same network,\n\n540\n00:26:13.670 --> 00:26:15.020\nyou can have more than one, right?\n\n541\n00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:17.250\nAnd so,\nthat's what it's talking about there.\n\n542\n00:26:17.250 --> 00:26:23.161\nAnd then after that,\nI can see 4.8 MB stored, right?\n\n543\n00:26:23.161 --> 00:26:25.774\nThat's it adding the file to the cache.\n\n544\n00:26:25.774 --> 00:26:28.038\nAnd so, it's now in my cache and\nit's ready to go.\n\n545\n00:26:28.038 --> 00:26:31.588\nAnd then right after that,\nI hit the button twice, right,\n\n546\n00:26:31.588 --> 00:26:33.506\nwhen I did that password thing?\n\n547\n00:26:33.506 --> 00:26:38.235\nSo you can see I received another\nGET request but this time,\n\n548\n00:26:38.235 --> 00:26:42.689\nserved all 4.8 MB,\nserved all 4.8 MB from cache.\n\n549\n00:26:42.689 --> 00:26:44.339\nIt came entirely out of the cache and\n\n550\n00:26:44.339 --> 00:26:46.485\nwe didn't have to serve\nit up a different way.\n\n551\n00:26:46.485 --> 00:26:49.449\nAnd then it's just giving me a little\nstatus report here saying, so\n\n552\n00:26:49.449 --> 00:26:52.360\nfar we've served up 9.7 megabytes of data.\n\n553\n00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:55.746\n>> Don, in the software update,\nyou'd mentioned how, and I believe you did\n\n554\n00:26:55.746 --> 00:26:59.423\nmention this, where you mentioned it's\nHTTP that this is connecting to Apple?\n\n555\n00:26:59.423 --> 00:27:03.290\nI saw that get request, I can only imagine\nthat maybe this is also HTTP here?\n\n556\n00:27:03.290 --> 00:27:05.630\n>> Yeah, it's on a different port.\n\n557\n00:27:05.630 --> 00:27:06.755\n>> I got you.\n>> And it's encrypted.\n\n558\n00:27:06.755 --> 00:27:08.540\nApple's done stuff to\nmake it a non standard.\n\n559\n00:27:08.540 --> 00:27:11.090\nBut at the end of the day\nit really is an HTTP call.\n\n560\n00:27:11.090 --> 00:27:14.880\nSo, you'll see that kind of\ncommunication around here.\n\n561\n00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:17.470\nBut basically, that's it,\nwe're now caching server.\n\n562\n00:27:17.470 --> 00:27:20.690\nAnd If I start downloading more stuff,\nif I fire up another client, and\n\n563\n00:27:20.690 --> 00:27:24.287\nI continually do this on all my different\nsystems, the cache is going to grow and\n\n564\n00:27:24.287 --> 00:27:25.003\ngrow and grow.\n\n565\n00:27:25.003 --> 00:27:27.639\nAnd that leads to one of the only\nmaintenance tasks that we have with\n\n566\n00:27:27.639 --> 00:27:30.410\nthe caching server,\nwhich is simply monitoring storage.\n\n567\n00:27:30.410 --> 00:27:32.630\nAnd if I go back to my server app and\n\n568\n00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:36.240\nI go into caching, you'll see where\nyou get a little note right here.\n\n569\n00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:43.340\nAnd see how it's telling me 4.8 MB used of\n25 GB, and so that's why my 25 GB cache.\n\n570\n00:27:43.340 --> 00:27:48.100\nNotice down here though,\n25 GB, 5.65 GB available.\n\n571\n00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:52.320\nNow, that seems odd for\na cache that is almost entirely empty,\n\n572\n00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:53.910\nwhy is it saying that?\n\n573\n00:27:53.910 --> 00:27:57.660\nWell, there's a lot of files that we treat\nas cache that aren't necessarily a part of\n\n574\n00:27:57.660 --> 00:27:58.260\nthe cache.\n\n575\n00:27:58.260 --> 00:27:59.460\nAnd so,\n\n576\n00:27:59.460 --> 00:28:02.590\nit's basically identifying some of those,\nsome of the like operating system files\n\n577\n00:28:02.590 --> 00:28:05.270\nthat we've already got in the machine\nthat we don't have to put in the cache.\n\n578\n00:28:05.270 --> 00:28:07.540\nAnd so\nit's got my numbers a little skewed.\n\n579\n00:28:07.540 --> 00:28:11.020\nIf you ever wanna flush your cache,\nyou can use that Reset button and\n\n580\n00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:14.390\nit'll reset it'll empty out your cache,\ninvalidate everything and re-download, and\n\n581\n00:28:14.390 --> 00:28:15.520\nso you can kind of get a clean start.\n\n582\n00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:19.310\nAnd you can also bump it up\nif you need a larger cache\n\n583\n00:28:19.310 --> 00:28:20.720\nto be able to allocate that to.\n\n584\n00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:23.700\nSo, you've got a few different things\nthat you can do in there, but for\n\n585\n00:28:23.700 --> 00:28:27.320\nthe most part,\nwe just turn it on and walk away.\n\n586\n00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:29.750\nThat's it, it's done and\nyou've got a caching server.\n\n587\n00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:30.890\n>> Great information.\n\n588\n00:28:30.890 --> 00:28:34.780\nNow, keep in mind that we've been talking\nabout the caching software inside of\n\n589\n00:28:34.780 --> 00:28:35.640\nthis episode.\n\n590\n00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:37.180\nDon, got anything else for us?\n\n591\n00:28:37.180 --> 00:28:38.410\n>> That's about it.\nRemember the key thing you\n\n592\n00:28:38.410 --> 00:28:42.290\nyou can only use caching, or\nsoftware update, you can't use both so\n\n593\n00:28:42.290 --> 00:28:44.470\nlook at them and figure out which\none's going to be the winner for you.\n\n594\n00:28:44.470 --> 00:28:46.620\nAfter that,\nneither one of them's very hard to set up.\n\n595\n00:28:46.620 --> 00:28:49.840\nSoftware update was harder to set up I\nguess in general, but it wasn't that hard,\n\n596\n00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:51.250\nI mean at the end of the day.\n\n597\n00:28:51.250 --> 00:28:53.110\nCaching is super easy.\n\n598\n00:28:53.110 --> 00:28:54.050\nYou flip an on switch.\n\n599\n00:28:54.050 --> 00:28:57.550\n>> All comes down to whether you\nwant control versus bandwidth.\n\n600\n00:28:57.550 --> 00:29:00.020\nAnd looks like this one's\nall about bandwidth.\n\n601\n00:29:00.020 --> 00:29:01.190\nSo thanks for that information.\n\n602\n00:29:01.190 --> 00:29:04.380\nLooks like we've come to the end of\nanother great episode here at ITProTV.\n\n603\n00:29:04.380 --> 00:29:06.100\nI've been your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n604\n00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:07.030\n>> And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n605\n00:29:07.030 --> 00:29:08.715\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n606\n00:29:08.715 --> 00:29:13.475\n[SOUND]\n\n",
