          "transcript": "1\r\n00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,800\r\n[Music]\r\n\r\n2\r\n00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:16,966\r\nLet's take a moment to look at the Apple Certified Associate Certification.  It's designed to be an entry level certification for you to get \r\n\r\n3\r\n00:00:16,966 --> 00:00:25,199\r\nintroduced into the world of managing Macintosh PCs, and as such, it starts out pretty basic.  We have a couple of different certifications we \r\n\r\n4\r\n00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:33,033\r\ncan go through.  The one I want to look at specifically is the Mac Management Basics, the show that this video is going to be a part of.  \r\n\r\n5\r\n00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:40,499\r\nMac Management Basics is showing, well, kind of like what the name implies, that you have a grasp of the basic tasks necessary to \r\n\r\n6\r\n00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:47,366\r\nadminister a network pack full of Macs.  So, you might be in a school or a business, any kind of environment.  If you've got a lot of Macintosh \r\n\r\n7\r\n00:00:47,366 --> 00:00:55,166\r\nPCs then it is something you're going to have to support, and there are a lot of really cool utilities and features and functions that your average end \r\n\r\n8\r\n00:00:55,166 --> 00:01:02,966\r\nuser just never even sees but that we can really take advantage of to create a smooth networking environment.  So let's start talking about the \r\n\r\n9\r\n00:01:02,966 --> 00:01:10,032\r\ncertification itself.  If you weren't already aware, Apple does have a series of certifications you can pursue to show your knowledge in \r\n\r\n10\r\n00:01:10,033 --> 00:01:18,333\r\nsupporting Macintosh machines.  If you go to training.apple.com/certification, you can learn about them.  They've got their creative side as \r\n\r\n11\r\n00:01:18,333 --> 00:01:26,233\r\nwell as their ITPro side and that's what we want to see, ITPro.  You'll see the Mavericks 10.9 certifications.  That's where I'm going to go.  All \r\n\r\n12\r\n00:01:26,233 --> 00:01:34,766\r\nright, on the OS X side, you'll see several different certs that we can pursue, and let me just zoom in a little bit here.  It basically breaks \r\n\r\n13\r\n00:01:34,766 --> 00:01:42,599\r\ndown like this.  You start off with a couple of lower level Apple Certified Associate certifications, and from there you work up to the \r\n\r\n14\r\n00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:51,166\r\nhigher level Apple Certified Support Professional and the Apple Certified Technical Coordinator, that ACTC being at the highest level of this block \r\n\r\n15\r\n00:01:51,166 --> 00:01:59,132\r\nof certifications.  There are other certifications that are out there for people who are doing Apple warranty work that are actually repairing \r\n\r\n16\r\n00:01:59,133 --> 00:02:05,833\r\ncomputers.  These certifications focus more on the software side. actually managing and operating them, right?  If you get your Apple \r\n\r\n17\r\n00:02:05,833 --> 00:02:12,066\r\nCare warranty, you don't really need to know how to fix the hardware.  They take care of that for you, but managing the software, that's what \r\n\r\n18\r\n00:02:12,066 --> 00:02:19,166\r\nyou have to deal with.  So, we start right here with this one.  Mac Management Basics.  The Mac Management Certification is a great one to \r\n\r\n19\r\n00:02:19,166 --> 00:02:27,499\r\nget started with because it is geared towards people like you and me that have to support these machines, and it is not a very over-the-top \r\n\r\n20\r\n00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:35,400\r\ncertification so it's a pretty easy one to get started with and get your feet wet.  It is expected that you already know how to operate \r\n\r\n21\r\n00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:44,566\r\nat least a single Macintosh PC, that you know how to use the finder and install software, uninstall software, those kind of activities that \r\n\r\n22\r\n00:02:44,566 --> 00:02:51,766\r\nare just day-to-day operations.  So, you are expected to be, well, a Mac user, right, just to have that regular end-user knowledge, but then \r\n\r\n23\r\n00:02:51,766 --> 00:02:59,532\r\nwe add on the server knowledge on top of that to be able to manage these environments.  The certification consists of one course, right,  \r[\r\n\r\n24\r\n00:02:59,533 --> 00:03:06,599\r\ninaudible] knowledge and then one exam, and some of the nice things about it, well, they make the book for it, The Mac Management \r\n\r\n25\r\n00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:13,900\r\nBasics Guide, right there?  It is available for free.  You can download it right from Apple's website.  Every single question on the exam comes right \r\n\r\n26\r\n00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:21,200\r\nout of that book so everything that you need to know is right here.  It is just a .pdf that you can go and download, so if I click on it, it is going to \r\n\r\n27\r\n00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:29,333\r\ndownload here and, I'm not joking, everything you need to know is right here.  The book is not that bad.  It is about 90 pages long, and it goes \r\n\r\n28\r\n00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:36,833\r\nstep by step through all the various activities, and that's what we're going to use as a guideline for this show for our ITProTV Mac Management \r\n\r\n29\r\n00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:43,966\r\nBasic Show.  We're basically going to run right down this list and cover all the content that's in the book.  So, if you're a book reader, grab this.  \r\n\r\n30\r\n00:03:43,966 --> 00:03:50,799\r\nIt's got everything you need, but if you're not a book reader, if you want to see all this done in action, well, that's where we come in.  All right, \r\n\r\n31\r\n00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:58,700\r\nthe exam itself, you can take the exam two different ways.  Notice here it says available online.  You can take it in person at an Apple \r\n\r\n32\r\n00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:08,033\r\nAuthorized Training Center, (AATC).  If there is an AATC near you, then you can find that, jump on over there and take the exam.  The nearest \r\n\r\n33\r\n00:04:08,033 --> 00:04:15,966\r\nAATC for me is about two hours away, so that's not the coolest thing.  I don't like to have to drive two hours just to take an exam, so fortunately, \r\n\r\n34\r\n00:04:15,966 --> 00:04:23,232\r\nthis one is available online, also.  Now, a quick word about that, when you go in here to sign up for the exam, it's going to tell you you need to \r\n\r\n35\r\n00:04:23,233 --> 00:04:32,233\r\nsign up through Pearson VUE.  Pearson VUE is a third-party testing provider.  Here is the link right here to go and sign up for that exam.  Well, \r\n\r\n36\r\n00:04:32,233 --> 00:04:42,099\r\nthe Pearson VUE website defaults to the physically proctored exam, the one that you take at the AATC.  If you want to take it online, \r\n\r\n37\r\n00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:49,166\r\nyou actually have to, pay attention, you have to read what the website says.  It says right here that you get an exam key code, this Mac \r\n\r\n38\r\n00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:57,899\r\nMGMT 109, that's a special code that will let you sign up to take the exam online.  If you don't do that, it's going to assume you want to \r\n\r\n39\r\n00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:07,266\r\ntake it at a physical center.  The exam is $65, so, it's not terribly expensive.  It is 45 questions, although it doesn't say that here.  It's 45 \r\n\r\n40\r\n00:05:07,266 --> 00:05:17,066\r\nquestions long, and you get two hours to take it.  Plenty of time.  You won't be under pressure on this one.  Two hours for 45 questions is pretty \r\n\r\n41\r\n00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:27,432\r\nroomy, as far as time is concerned.  Five of the questions won't count toward your score.  They're like beta questions or things they're \r\n\r\n42\r\n00:05:27,433 --> 00:05:36,033\r\ntesting out just to see how well they work, so really only 40 of the questions are scored, and you need an 80% to pass.  So, an 80% will get \r\n\r\n43\r\n00:05:36,033 --> 00:05:43,999\r\nyou to pass.  Now, the five beta questions I mentioned, you don't know which ones they are, so you might as well just treat all 45 as scored \r\n\r\n44\r\n00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:51,900\r\nquestions.  You don't know which ones are going to be thrown out, but of the 40 remaining, you've got to get 80% right to pass.  To sign up \r\n\r\n45\r\n00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:58,266\r\nfor the exam, we just click on that Pearson VUE link, and it will take us over there to sign up, and you'll see where you can purchase an exam \r\n\r\n46\r\n00:05:58,266 --> 00:06:06,766\r\nfrom here or learn more.  Notice there are Apple Care certs.  Those are for the hardware repair personnel, and then you've got the Apple IT and \r\n\r\n47\r\n00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:14,266\r\nPro Apps.  That's the one that we want, right, where they are doing the IT side, and when you go to purchase the exam, here is where it will \r\n\r\n48\r\n00:06:14,266 --> 00:06:19,699\r\nwant you to sign in with your Pearson VUE account to go that route.  \r\n\r\n49\r\n00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:25,366\r\nNow, I don't want to sign in with my account here, but let me just go to the main \rPearson site, and on the main Pearson site, if \r\n\r\n50\r\n00:06:25,366 --> 00:06:34,266\r\nwe go to sign up for a test, I'm just going to go in here and tell it I'm going to do an IT and I want Apple IT and Pro Apps.   All right.  So, from \r\n\r\n51\r\n00:06:34,266 --> 00:06:42,066\r\nhere, you can go in and you can tell it, like, you want to view available exams, and it is going to list the Apple exams and I'll see Mac \r\n\r\n52\r\n00:06:42,066 --> 00:06:51,999\r\nManagement Basics right there, right, and it says 9L0-418.  That's my exam number!  But the problem is this one is referring to the AATC \r\n\r\n53\r\n00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:59,000\r\nproctored one, the one where you actually have to go to a training center.  But you'll see up here, do you have a private access code, and if \r\n\r\n54\r\n00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:07,366\r\nwe paste in that private access code from the website, that Mac MGMT 109, when you enter that, notice what happens to the exam number \r\n\r\n55\r\n00:07:07,366 --> 00:07:16,699\r\n-418, right, that was the exam, and you'll see here it says 9L0-418NP.  That means nonproctored.  In other words, you're going to \r\n\r\n56\r\n00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:23,900\r\ntake it yourself.  You'll take it via your web browser right here online, so you don't have to go to an AATC to do it.  All right, so that's the \r\n\r\n57\r\n00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:31,700\r\none we want.  You can choose that and now it will take us to the sign-up process.  You pick your language, and you pay your bill.  You know, \r\n\r\n58\r\n00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:38,933\r\nit does cost $65 to sign up for it, so when we purchase it, that's the next step for us is to pay that money.  You'll have 48 hours to take the \r\n\r\n59\r\n00:07:38,933 --> 00:07:44,933\r\nexam, so just because you purchase it right now doesn't mean you have to take the exam right now.  You get 48 hours.  You do have to \r\n\r\n60\r\n00:07:44,933 --> 00:07:52,833\r\ntake it.  If you don't take it at the end of the 48-hour period, you lose your $65, and you'll have to sign up again.  All right?  Once you sign up, \r\n\r\n61\r\n00:07:52,833 --> 00:07:59,999\r\nthough, you sit down and take the exam.  It's not a very bad one.  It's a reasonable exam, I think, compared to some of the other vendors.  \r\n\r\n62\r\n00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:07,166\r\nOnce you pass it, you're certified.  You'll get an email from Apple letting you know that they received your results, and it usually takes a \r\n\r\n63\r\n00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:14,099\r\nweek or two before you actually get your final notification from them letting you know that your certification is now active.  So, you'll be an \r\n\r\n64\r\n00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:21,933\r\nApple Certified Associate.  Keep in mind that every time a new version of OS X comes out, they update these exams.  So, right now we're \r\n\r\n65\r\n00:08:21,933 --> 00:08:28,999\r\ndoing the Mavericks exams, and when the next one comes out, you know, we'll have to update again and do that.  Now the exam really doesn't \r\n\r\n66\r\n00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:37,766\r\nchange all that much from OS to OS, so like if you did the Snow Leopard Exam, comparing it to the Mavericks exam they are almost identical \r\n\r\n67\r\n00:08:37,766 --> 00:08:44,332\r\nbecause the management software we used hasn't changed all that much from time to time.  But you'll get, you know, a couple of things that \r\n\r\n68\r\n00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:53,499\r\nchange, so it is important to recertify to show that you're good to go on the new OSs.  So that's our first leg of the journey.  People who \r\n\r\n69\r\n00:08:53,500 --> 00:09:00,800\r\nare kind of setting out on this course normally don't stop with the Mac Management Basics.  They normally continue on, and let me just go \r\n\r\n70\r\n00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:12,000\r\nback a bit here to...  Oh, did I, I closed the tab.  Let me go back to the Apple Training site.  They will normally continue on to do some of the other \r\n\r\n71\r\n00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:19,833\r\ncertifications, like Mac Integration Basics.  That's when we start integrating our Macs with Windows PCs.  A lot of environments have \r\n\r\n72\r\n00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:27,199\r\nWindows machines, either because they have to or for software they want or something like that and so you might need to mix your Mac and \r\n\r\n73\r\n00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:35,700\r\nyour Windows environment and that is what that exam focuses on.  If you want to continue on and go to do the ACSP or ACTC, well, for those \r\n\r\n74\r\n00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:44,066\r\nyou can read the book, you can do the training, whatever, but the exam has to be proctored.  You have to take that at an Apple Authorized \r\n\r\n75\r\n00:09:44,066 --> 00:09:52,999\r\nTraining Center (AATC).  So, it's a little bit different there, but that's kind of the progression we go through as we get certified.  All right, so \r\n\r\n76\r\n00:09:53,000 --> 00:10:02,233\r\nfor this show, we're going to be tackling that Mac Management Basics, and, basically, we're going to use that .pdf that they've got, that book, \r\n\r\n77\r\n00:10:02,233 --> 00:10:08,899\r\nthat's going to be our guide as we go through, and we're just going to kind of move right through it, and it covers some really cool stuff.  \r\n\r\n78\r\n00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:18,000\r\nIt starts out showing how to create images of PCs, of Mac machines, and be able to deploy those to other systems, so if you have 100 \r\n\r\n79\r\n00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:25,133\r\nMacs and you want them all to have the same software and same configuration, that's where we start out.  We image one.  We deploy it out \r\n\r\n80\r\n00:10:25,133 --> 00:10:31,933\r\nacross as many as we need.  So, that's the first two sections that we do, creating images and deploying them.  From there, we cover things \r\n\r\n81\r\n00:10:31,933 --> 00:10:40,199\r\nlike Apple Remote Desktop, which is a really cool software package that lets you remotely deploy software, do screen control, do all sorts \r\n\r\n82\r\n00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:47,100\r\nof desktop management functionality.  We do policy management where we can get the configurations across Macs to be the same.  \r\n\r\n83\r\n00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:53,666\r\nWe will see software updates and keeping our systems up to date.  We'll talk about caching software downloads so that you're not having to \r\n\r\n84\r\n00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:58,999\r\ndownload over and over again on all of your individual machines.  You can download once and cache it and then distribute that out to your \r\n\r\n85\r\n00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:07,000\r\nmachines.  So, all of these are really cool things, things that your average home user has no need to do, but if your managing a school or \r\n\r\n86\r\n00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:13,500\r\na business, these are things you'll do all the time, so they're really important tasks and it's all stuff that we're going to cover in this show.  So, \r\n\r\n87\r\n00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:21,566\r\nif that sounds interesting to you, you're in the right place.  Stay tuned.  We've got Mac Management Basics episodes coming up soon.  \r\n\r\n88\r\n00:11:21,566 --> 00:11:27,699\r\n[Music] \r\n\r\n",

I'm your host, Don Pezet, \r\n\r\n3\r\n00:00:40,133 --> 00:00:51,433\r\ntoday with the first episode of our Apple Certified Associate Certification show.  We're diving into Mac Management Basics today, and you know, \r\n\r\n4\r\n00:00:51,433 --> 00:00:57,533\r\nwe might as well just get started, right.  Normally, I have my co-host here so I can do some witty banter here at the beginning, but I've \r\n\r\n5\r\n00:00:57,533 --> 00:01:04,899\r\nfound that when I try and do witty banter with myself, it just doesn't turn out very well.  So let's go ahead and get started and jump into creating \r\n\r\n6\r\n00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:12,166\r\nsystem images.  Now, for most of us if you've worked with a Mac, you buy it, right.  You go to apple.com or wherever and you buy it.  They \r\n\r\n7\r\n00:01:12,166 --> 00:01:18,666\r\nship it to you.  It's already got the operating system on there. And you're good to go, right.  No messing with it.  You just fire it up, and off \r\n\r\n8\r\n00:01:18,666 --> 00:01:29,232\r\nyou go, right?  Well, that works out fine for a lot of people, but what if you have hundreds of Macs and that default configuration that comes \r\n\r\n9\r\n00:01:29,233 --> 00:01:37,533\r\nfrom Apple isn't quite what you want.  You want to modify that a little bit.  Well, to have to go to hundreds of computers and change those \r\n\r\n10\r\n00:01:37,533 --> 00:01:48,233\r\nsettings, that's quite a burden.  So, wouldn't it be nice if we could create a new default image for that machine that we could roll out and have \r\n\r\n11\r\n00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:53,899\r\nit change it, have it meet our needs and do it quickly across hundreds, thousands of machines and get them all set up the way we \r\n\r\n12\r\n00:01:53,900 --> 00:02:02,333\r\nneed.  That's one example where a system image can come in handy.  Another example would be, let's say you work in a school and \r\n\r\n13\r\n00:02:02,333 --> 00:02:09,133\r\nyou've got middle school kids and high school kids that are using those computers, what are they going to do?  They're going to mess with \r\n\r\n14\r\n00:02:09,133 --> 00:02:14,833\r\nthings.  They're going to install software.  They're going to do all sorts of things to mess those computers up.  Wouldn't it be nice to have \r\n\r\n15\r\n00:02:14,833 --> 00:02:20,933\r\na way to quickly reset that machine and put it back to the way that you wanted it, the way that you needed it with your software, your \r\n\r\n16\r\n00:02:20,933 --> 00:02:28,433\r\nconfiguration settings, putting everything back nice and clean and removing all that other junk?  That's another scenario where we can use \r\n\r\n17\r\n00:02:28,433 --> 00:02:38,699\r\nsystem images.  So what is an image?  An image, like a computer image, it's really like a photograph or a snapshot.  We take a computer \r\n\r\n18\r\n00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:46,866\r\nand we get it set up exactly the way that we want it.  We install our software.  We do any we need, and then we freeze it in a point in time.  \r\n\r\n19\r\n00:02:46,866 --> 00:02:56,599\r\nWe take a capture of that machine.  We basically copy the entire hard drive. Exactly as it is at that moment.  We copy that hard drive \r\n\r\n20\r\n00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:03,366\r\nand we store it somewhere.  We store it on our server somewhere, and then whenever we want, we can bring that copy right back down again.  \r\n\r\n21\r\n00:03:03,366 --> 00:03:09,532\r\nNow, you don't have to maintain a single copy of each and every computer in your entire environment.  If all of your computers are set up  \r\n\r\n22\r\n00:03:09,533 --> 00:03:17,533\r\nbasically the same way, then you can create one copy and use it over and over and over again for your machines.  It makes it a lot easier on \r\n\r\n23\r\n00:03:17,533 --> 00:03:27,633\r\nus, but it also makes it a lot more consistent for your end users.   All of your computers are set up the same way.  Now, if you've never heard of \r\n\r\n24\r\n00:03:27,633 --> 00:03:35,266\r\nsystem imaging before, well you've actually used it.  You've used it without knowing it.  When you install Mac OS, when you pop in that \r\n\r\n25\r\n00:03:35,266 --> 00:03:40,466\r\nDVD, if you still have one, or that thumb drive or download it from the app store, what you're doing is you're actually getting\r\n\r\n26\r\n00:03:40,466 --> 00:03:50,332\r\nan image, a disk image, of a computer somewhere in Cupertino that has the exact setup that you want, or that they want, and you \r\n\r\n27\r\n00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:57,799\r\ndeploy that to your machine and it's installed and off you go.  You're running an install that they've already created for you.  You can \r\n\r\n28\r\n00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:04,100\r\ncustomize however you want from there.  Well, they're not the only ones that can do that.  They give us the tools.  They don't make it very \r\n\r\n29\r\n00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:10,333\r\nobvious.  It is kind of hidden away, because it is not something that an end user would need.  It is something that a network admin, a systems \r\n\r\n30\r\n00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:19,833\r\nadministrator, we're the ones who would need it, but it is built in.  Now in Mac OS, we actually have three different types of images that we can \r\n\r\n31\r\n00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:29,199\r\nwork with.  There are the NetBoot images, NetInstall images, and the NetRestore images.  Those are our three image types that we work \r\n\r\n32\r\n00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:36,733\r\nwith.  So, let me just talk talk briefly about the three of them.  NetBoot, that's the one the we're going to use the least.  It's not very common.  \r\n\r\n33\r\n00:04:36,733 --> 00:04:42,499\r\nMost people never mess with them, and it doesn't really show up on the exam but I want to mention it here because it is important to know.  \r\n\r\n34\r\n00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:50,533\r\nNetBoot is where you can have a \rMac with no hard drive, no hard drive whatsoever, and you can have it boot right up off \r\n\r\n35\r\n00:04:50,533 --> 00:04:59,199\r\nof the network and it can reach out onto the network and it can find an operating system out there and boot its operating system entirely from \r\n\r\n36\r\n00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:08,166\r\nthe network.  On a positive side, there is no configuration we need to do on the individual Mac and there is no hard drive we have to worry \r\n\r\n37\r\n00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:16,466\r\nabout losing and every time you reboot it it's fresh and clean so those are the positive sides.  The negative side, it's a slow process.  Most \r\n\r\n38\r\n00:05:16,466 --> 00:05:22,766\r\nnetworks that are out there are not really set to perform at that level.  If you have a bunch of machines that are all running their operating \r\n\r\n39\r\n00:05:22,766 --> 00:05:30,766\r\nsystem off the network, you run out of band width, you get congestion, and you just don't get the performance that you want so NetBoot is not \r\n\r\n40\r\n00:05:30,766 --> 00:05:39,966\r\nvery common.  You know a Mavericks installed by itself is gonna be usually, if you just do the base plain install, it is usually going to be \r\n\r\n41\r\n00:05:39,966 --> 00:05:47,799\r\nsomewhere in the 9 GB range so imagine booting your system and having to get 9 GB of data.  It's not something that's ideal.  It takes a \r\n\r\n42\r\n00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:55,266\r\nlong time to reboot.  So, normally when you see NetBoot, it's with very, very small operating systems. They create a very stripped down \r\n\r\n43\r\n00:05:55,266 --> 00:06:03,432\r\nversions of Mac OS that just runs a single application or something like that, again, not very common.  The other two solutions, on the \r\n\r\n44\r\n00:06:03,433 --> 00:06:12,899\r\nother hand, are very common and that's NetInstall and NetRestore.  NetInstall, that's where we install Mac OS via our network and \r\n\r\n45\r\n00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:23,666\r\ntechnically you do that when you do an update through like the app store.  So, if you buy a MacBook Pro and it ships with Mac OS 10.8 \r\n\r\n46\r\n00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:32,099\r\nand then you go into your app store and you see that Mavericks is available so you update to 10.9, well it's downloading an image of 10.9 and \r\n\r\n47\r\n00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:39,666\r\ninstalling it on your machine.  It's very similar to what NetInstall does.  The only difference is with NetInstall, it is us that creates the server.  We \r\n\r\n48\r\n00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:46,466\r\ncontrol the server; it's not the app store, and when our machines boot on our own network, they can reach out and grab that installer and \r\n\r\n49\r\n00:06:46,466 --> 00:06:57,532\r\ninstall their operating system from a central location.  That's what NetInstall is.  NetInstall is designed to push default installs, the installation \r\n\r\n50\r\n00:06:57,533 --> 00:07:05,399\r\nfrom Apple, you know, as they designed it and when a user runs it, they're going to see the installation procedure just just like they booted \r\n\r\n51\r\n00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:13,366\r\noff a DVD or a thumb drive so they're going to walk through the full installation options as they do it.  So, NetInstall, that's one option, and I'll \r\n\r\n52\r\n00:07:13,366 --> 00:07:19,732\r\nshow you guys later, we can automate it.  We can make it where they don't have to answer questions, where it just does the install and gets \r\n\r\n53\r\n00:07:19,733 --> 00:07:28,733\r\nit in place.  You can customize it, but it was designed to push the default install.  That's what NetInstall does.  NetRestore, on the other hand, \r\n\r\n54\r\n00:07:28,733 --> 00:07:39,033\r\nNetRestore is designed where you can take a Mac, right, take a MacBook or a MacPro or whatever on your network, fire it up, install your \r\n\r\n55\r\n00:07:39,033 --> 00:07:44,999\r\ncustom third party software, get everything set the way that you want it, right, whatever software you need, whatever files you need, \r\n\r\n56\r\n00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:53,900\r\nfolders, user accounts.  You create all the stuff that you need, and then we take an image of that machine.  We clone that machine and a file \r\n\r\n57\r\n00:07:53,900 --> 00:08:03,833\r\nwill get stored up on the server that contains that machine as it was at that point in time, and then you can use NetRestore over the network.  \r\n\r\n58\r\n00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:11,366\r\nYou can take a, you know, maybe get new MacBook.  You fire it up on the network. It can reach out, grab that image, and copy it down, \r\n\r\n59\r\n00:08:11,366 --> 00:08:18,132\r\ninstantly making your MacBook look exactly like the machine that you imaged.  So, maybe you installed 20 different software programs.  \r\n\r\n60\r\n00:08:18,133 --> 00:08:25,533\r\nWell, all 20 software programs will now be on your MacBook.  It downloads them from the server as one big chunk, one big image, deploys \r\n\r\n61\r\n00:08:25,533 --> 00:08:33,466\r\nit on your system, and now you're configured identically to that reference machine. It takes a little more work to do this, but it can save you a \r\n\r\n62\r\n00:08:33,466 --> 00:08:40,199\r\nlot of time.  If you've got to deploy software on 1000 different machines, wouldn't it be nice if they just already had that software on there so \r\n\r\n63\r\n00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:48,266\r\nyou didn't have to deploy it?  Using an image like this is one way to do it.  Now we're going to see, it'll probably be episode number three or \r\n\r\n64\r\n00:08:48,266 --> 00:08:54,966\r\nso, we'll cover another utility called Remote Desktop, and we can actually deploy software to machines that are already installed, so there are \r\n\r\n65\r\n00:08:54,966 --> 00:09:01,166\r\nother ways to do this but this is one method.  And you're going to see that repeatedly throughout the show.  You might say, well, wait \r\n\r\n66\r\n00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:07,499\r\na minute, Don, didn't we see another way we could do this and often times, that is the case.  There is more than one way to do same thing.  \r\n\r\n67\r\n00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:13,633\r\nYou just need to pick the one that works for you.  Pick the one that's right for your environment.  There's always more than one way to get the job \r\n\r\n68\r\n00:09:13,633 --> 00:09:22,066\r\ndone.  All right, so if I want to work with one of these, one of the first requirements that I'm going to need is an image.  I'm going to have to \r\n\r\n69\r\n00:09:22,066 --> 00:09:28,799\r\ncreate an image, so I want to walk you guys through that process creating a NetInstall image as well as creating a NetRestore image.  I want \r\n\r\n70\r\n00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:37,666\r\nto show you that.  This episode, we're just going to focus on creating the images.  In episode number two, I'll show you guys how to actually \r\n\r\n71\r\n00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:44,732\r\ndeploy the images, how to send them out.  There's a little more to it to deploy it because to deploy it we actually need a machine that's \r\n\r\n72\r\n00:09:44,733 --> 00:09:52,599\r\nrunning Mac OS X Server so we need the server application running and so I'll talk all about that in episode number two.  But here in episode \r\n\r\n73\r\n00:09:52,600 --> 00:10:00,766\r\nnumber one, we're just creating the image and to create the image you don't need a server.  You can use any Mac to create the image that \r\n\r\n74\r\n00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:09,699\r\nyou need.  So that's where we're going to start and I want to start with just NetInstall, the default, the basic, just getting Mac OS 10 or \r\n\r\n75\r\n00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:18,000\r\nMAC OS X loaded onto a machine and in place.  So to do that we can start out on a machine, and actually I'm going to start out over here.  \r\n\r\n76\r\n00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:26,966\r\nThis machine, this is one that I've got that just has a plain old install.  I haven't done anything to it.  It's got default wallpaper, default applications.  \r\n\r\n77\r\n00:10:26,966 --> 00:10:35,932\r\nI did do some updates on it but that's about it so this is just a plain Jane install right here, but here is a machine that I've messed with a little \r\n\r\n78\r\n00:10:35,933 --> 00:10:44,499\r\nbit, and you'll see I've called OSX-Server1.  If you've never worked with a server piece, I guess let me talk about that real quick.  There really is \r\n\r\n79\r\n00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:56,700\r\nno difference between a Mac OS 10 Client and a Mac OS 10 Server.  They really are identical.  The only difference is we've installed the server \r\n\r\n80\r\n00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:04,066\r\napplication on a server.  So here's a server and I've installed this application right here, the server application.  You can get it right out of the \r\n\r\n81\r\n00:11:04,066 --> 00:11:10,766\r\napp store.  It costs $20.00, and now you're a server.  It is the same hardware.  It is the same operating system.  It is the same everything, \r\n\r\n82\r\n00:11:10,766 --> 00:11:18,499\r\nexcept for this one little application.  I say little.  I don't think it's very big at all.  I think it's like 20 MB or something.  Here, let me fire up my app \r\n\r\n83\r\n00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:31,100\r\nstore, and I will tell you.  I'm just going to go into the app store here.  There it is, OS X Server, and, you know I thought it said the size.  Oh, \r\n\r\n84\r\n00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:38,866\r\nthere it is, 179 MB.  All right, it's bigger than I thought, 179 MG, but it's $20.00.  You buy it, you install it, and now you've got a server.  Many \r\n\r\n85\r\n00:11:38,866 --> 00:11:46,732\r\nof you might remember that Apple used to sell a dedicated operating system that was called OS X Server.  They kind of did away with that years \r\n\r\n86\r\n00:11:46,733 --> 00:11:56,066\r\nago, and now we just have this app that we install, so on this machine, I've removed some things.  I've removed like the iLife stuff.  I didn't \r\n\r\n87\r\n00:11:56,066 --> 00:12:02,466\r\nneed iPhoto and all that, so I have kind of either \rdisabled or removed or just deleted the icon because sometimes you can't delete the \r\n\r\n88\r\n00:12:02,466 --> 00:12:10,332\r\nsoftware.  So I just kind of cleaned that up to just have my server-related stuff on here, and I ditched the fancy wallpaper.  It's just stuff that I \r\n\r\n89\r\n00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:17,966\r\ndo on a server.  But otherwise it's just a regular machine, and I can use this to make images, if I want, or I could use a regular machine, if I \r\n\r\n90\r\n00:12:17,966 --> 00:12:28,132\r\nwanted to.  It works either way.  The first step to making a Mavericks NetInstall disc is the disk part.  We don't have a disc.  If you buy it, like \r\n\r\n91\r\n00:12:28,133 --> 00:12:35,433\r\nmy laptop here, so I've got a MacBook Pro Retina.  It's the, you know, the ...  I bought it this year, but it's the late 2013 model.  It \r\n\r\n92\r\n00:12:35,433 --> 00:12:44,566\r\nshipped with Mavericks, had it on there already.  I didn't get any discs.  It didn't come with a DVD for me.  So, how do I get that installer?  And we \r\n\r\n93\r\n00:12:44,566 --> 00:12:53,666\r\nget it from the app store.  If you go into the app store and just and just do a search for Mavericks, all right, so I'll just do a search for \r\n\r\n94\r\n00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:59,532\r\nMavericks.  You'll find it right there, OS X Mavericks.  Now, if you were running Snow Leopard or an earlier operating system, this is \r\n\r\n95\r\n00:12:59,533 --> 00:13:05,033\r\nhow you do the update.  You would come in here to Mavericks and you would choose download, and it would download and launch the \r\n\r\n96\r\n00:13:05,033 --> 00:13:12,866\r\nupdater and update you into Mavericks.  That's your upgrade process.  But if you've already got it, you still see this option here, and the reason \r\n\r\n97\r\n00:13:12,866 --> 00:13:20,899\r\nis, if you choose download, what it's doing is it's downloading the installation image.  And if we're going to be working with NetInstall, we're going \r\n\r\n98\r\n00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:28,700\r\nto need that installation image.  So, you'll go ahead and download it.  Now, be aware, it's like 8 GB in size, I think.  Let me see.  It is, oop, I'm \r\n\r\n99\r\n00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:36,833\r\nlying to you.  It's 5.3 GB in size.  It's not small, though, so it is going to take a little while to download, so download that image.  Now, when \r\n\r\n100\r\n00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:43,166\r\nyou download it, you know, you'll just hit this download link.  When it finishes, it will probably try and run.  It'll probably try and run and \r\n\r\n101\r\n00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:51,032\r\nupgrade your system to Mavericks.  Just cancel it.  Just quit out of that.  When that's done you now have the installation image, and it will be \r\n\r\n102\r\n00:13:51,033 --> 00:14:00,499\r\nsitting on your hard drive.  If you browse into your finder and go under applications, when it's done you'll have an application in here called \r\n\r\n103\r\n00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:13,166\r\nInstall OS X Mavericks.  That's the install image.  If I pull up my little information screen, you can see there is 5.3 GB.  It's an application.  That's \r\n\r\n104\r\n00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:23,799\r\nmy installer.  That's got all of the installation files to set up a new machine to run OS X 10.9.  Now, that file, it's all kind of wrapped up in a \r.\r\n\r\n105\r\n00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:30,866\r\ndmg into a disk image, but that's fine.  That's just what we need right there.  So we download it and just let it sit right there.  If you've already \r\n\r\n106\r\n00:14:30,866 --> 00:14:36,966\r\ndownloaded it on one machine, you can just copy it.  You know, I copy it up to a network share here, but you can copy it around.  You \r\n\r\n107\r\n00:14:36,966 --> 00:14:44,999\r\ndon't have to download it from the app store.  You just need to get it from somewhere.  Once we've got it, we're ready to make that NetInstall \r\n\r\n108\r\n00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:54,500\r\nimage.  It's not in the NetInstall format.  We can't just use this .dmg file the way that it is.  We've got to get it updated.  To do that, we use \r\n\r\n109\r\n00:14:54,500 --> 00:15:02,000\r\na utility that doesn't have an icon in here.  Some of you guys might be used to things like the disk utility, and, you know, disk utility I don't see \r\n\r\n110\r\n00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:10,800\r\nhere under applications.  It is buried under utilities and then in here we can find like the disk utility, right there.  So the disk utility where \r\n\r\n111\r\n00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:19,833\r\nwe can mount .dmg files and do things like that, but to create images we have a separate utility called the System Image Utility.  It's kind of \r\n\r\n112\r\n00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:26,733\r\nappropriately named.  Now, if you're an old school Mac user, you might be saying, \"Wait a minute, Don.  I can create images with the disk \r\n\r\n113\r\n00:15:26,733 --> 00:15:36,999\r\nutility,\" and you're right.  You can.  That's the old way to do it, and with the newer OSs, like with Mavericks, if you use the disk utility here to \r\n\r\n114\r\n00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:44,266\r\ncreate your disk images, it will not create the recovery partition and if you don't care about that, then fine, you're in good shape.  You don't \r\n\r\n115\r\n00:15:44,266 --> 00:15:52,032\r\nneed the recovery partition.  But, I kind of like to have it.  That recovery partition is pretty handy, and the disk utility won't do that for Mavericks.  \r\n\r\n116\r\n00:15:52,033 --> 00:15:59,866\r\nSo, we need to use the system image \rutility because it will create that recovery petition and it's what's on the exam so if you \r\n\r\n117\r\n00:15:59,866 --> 00:16:06,299\r\nplan on passing, then you're going to want to use the system image utility.  Now, we don't have to download it or anything.  It is on the hard \r\n\r\n118\r\n00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:15,900\r\ndrive.  It just doesn't have an icon in our \rapplications folder.  So, if you browse into your hard drive and you go under system and library \r\n\r\n119\r\n00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:29,733\r\nand into core services.  So, I went into system, library, core services.  Inside of core services, you'll see a ton of stuff in here, a lot of things \r\n\r\n120\r\n00:16:29,733 --> 00:16:40,833\r\nthat are system preference tools and things of that nature, and buried down in here you will find the system image utility right there.  That's the \r\n\r\n121\r\n00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:47,033\r\nguy we want to use to create NetInstall images as well as NetRestore, and in fact when you launch it there we see the three image types I \r\n\r\n122\r\n00:16:47,033 --> 00:16:53,199\r\nwas talking about, NetBoot, NetInstall, and NetRestore, all three of them right there.  If I wanted to create that NetBoot image, I could \r\n\r\n123\r\n00:16:53,200 --> 00:17:03,300\r\nuse this.  When you create an image, it is being created either from a Mac OS install disc or from a hard drive, a hard drive that's got a \r\n\r\n124\r\n00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:12,833\r\nsystem setup the way that you want it.  So, it automatically detected that Mavericks disk that I downloaded.  It knows that because it's in my \r\n\r\n125\r\n00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:18,533\r\napplications folder.  If it wasn't in my applications folder, it wouldn't have been able to find it and this little drop down box here would've \r\n\r\n126\r\n00:17:18,533 --> 00:17:27,433\r\nbeen empty.  But if you downloaded it like I showed you, it'll show up, it'll find it, there we go, I've got it.  From there, I can choose to \r\n\r\n127\r\n00:17:27,433 --> 00:17:34,399\r\ncreate a type of image.  Now, I'm going to do a NetInstall image, for now.  I'm going to do a NetRestore next, but with a NetInstall, I'm \r\n\r\n128\r\n00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:41,733\r\nsaying I want to create a network installation disk, something where somebody can install Mavericks just right off of the network.  So, I'll \r\n\r\n129\r\n00:17:41,733 --> 00:17:51,033\r\nchoose NetInstall and hit continue.  Then we give it a name.  So, you know, we can call it NetInstall of OS X Mavericks.  This is what your \r\n\r\n130\r\n00:17:51,033 --> 00:17:57,466\r\nend users are going see.  When they go to boot off of this, they'll have to pick what they want to boot, and they'll see this information right here.  \r\n\r\n131\r\n00:17:57,466 --> 00:18:07,532\r\nI normally change it a little bit to say something like Network install of OS X Mavericks, and, you know, you might even want to get rid of the \r\n\r\n132\r\n00:18:07,533 --> 00:18:12,966\r\nMavericks part.  You know, your end user might not necessarily need to see that, so you just want to make it something that's easy for them \r\n\r\n133\r\n00:18:12,966 --> 00:18:19,966\r\nto understand what they're about to do.  And you can punch in some descriptive information here.  You know the default is just telling you about the \r\n\r\n134\r\n00:18:19,966 --> 00:18:28,466\r\nOS, but you might want to put other things in there, other warnings.  The default deployment scenario is that we're going to deploy this just \r\n\r\n135\r\n00:18:28,466 --> 00:18:34,466\r\nfrom one server, and you'll see a checkmark down here that says image will be served from more than one server.  I'm going to explain that \r\n\r\n136\r\n00:18:34,466 --> 00:18:40,199\r\noption a little bit later.  There is something special we need to do, if we're going to have this image in more than one place, but the default is \r\n\r\n137\r\n00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:50,633\r\nit is just going to be on one server and I'll stick with that.  When we hit create, it's going to let us agree to the End User License Agreement, \r\n\r\n138\r\n00:18:50,633 --> 00:18:59,733\r\nso we're going to agree to that, and it's going to go and create the NetInstall disk.  Now, where we save it is kind of up to us.  The default \r\n\r\n139\r\n00:18:59,733 --> 00:19:09,566\r\nlocation is into this NetBoot folder.  You can put it there, if you want, but typically, we're going to need it to be in the root of a hard drive, if you \r\n\r\n140\r\n00:19:09,566 --> 00:19:15,966\r\nwant to go the easy route.  We can park it here, if we want, but when we run the wizards in the second episode, when we're actually deploying \r\n\r\n141\r\n00:19:15,966 --> 00:19:21,366\r\nthis, they're all going to expect to find these images in the root of a hard drive and you don't normally want to just put it in the root of your \r\n\r\n142\r\n00:19:21,366 --> 00:19:29,066\r\nmain hard drive so we'll typically have removable storage.  So, like I've got this image storage here.  It's an external hard drive I've got \r\n\r\n143\r\n00:19:29,066 --> 00:19:35,266\r\nattached, but it can be an internal hard drive, too.  It doesn't have to be external.  And we can save the image there, and that's what I'm going \r\n\r\n144\r\n00:19:35,266 --> 00:19:45,032\r\nto do.  So, I'm going to just bump mine over to image storage, and this will be my network install of OS X.  And now it's going to create it.  \r\n\r\n145\r\n00:19:45,033 --> 00:19:52,533\r\nIt is basically taking that .dmg file and it's converting it into the NetInstall format.  You do have to be an admin to do this, so it's prompting \r\n\r\n146\r\n00:19:52,533 --> 00:20:02,766\r\nme for my credentials, and now it is going to churn along.  It does take a little while, because it is effectively copying 5.5 GB of data, so if \r\n\r\n147\r\n00:20:02,766 --> 00:20:09,766\r\nyou've got a really fast hard drive, this might go very quickly.  If you've got a slow hard drive, it might take longer.  Mine, this is actually going \r\n\r\n148\r\n00:20:09,766 --> 00:20:19,399\r\nover Thunderbolt, so it's decently fast, but it can still take a while, as it churns through and does it.  When it's done, I'll have a NetInstall disk.  \r\n\r\n149\r\n00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:28,700\r\nNow, the NetInstall disk itself, if I boot a machine off the network and go to deploy this, it is just going to be a straight-up, normal install of \r\n\r\n150\r\n00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:35,166\r\nOS X, the difference being, you know from like installing it from the app store, instead of having to go out to the app store and download it over \r\n\r\n151\r\n00:20:35,166 --> 00:20:42,866\r\nthe internet, now I can do the install right from servers on my own network.  And that's often times going to be much, much faster than what \r\n\r\n152\r\n00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:50,632\r\nwe get off of the internet.  There are other advantages of doing this, like I can customize it.  I didn't.  When I did this, I didn't customize \r\n\r\n153\r\n00:20:50,633 --> 00:20:57,299\r\nanything.  I just let it go.  This is going to be a straight, normal install.  The end users will have to walk through that installation wizard, as they \r\n\r\n154\r\n00:20:57,300 --> 00:21:05,000\r\ndeploy Mavericks on their machine.  So, if that's what we want, great.  We're done.  Well, we will be down eventually, and the image is in \r\n\r\n155\r\n00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:13,733\r\nbusiness.  But you can customize it, too.  We could've gone in there and done all sorts of other tweaks, and I'll show this at the end of the \r\n\r\n156\r\n00:21:13,733 --> 00:21:19,699\r\nepisode.  We can change things like how big we want the hard drive partition to be or what the partition layout should be, what the computer \r\n\r\n157\r\n00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:28,733\r\nname will be, what user accounts are created, what software is installed.  We can tweak all of that with these installation images. On one of \r\n\r\n158\r\n00:21:28,733 --> 00:21:35,433\r\nthe earlier screens, there was a customize button, and when you go in there, you can create Automater activities.  You can create a \r\n\r\n159\r\n00:21:35,433 --> 00:21:44,033\r\nbunch of tasks that will happen when this image gets deployed that completely customizes what it does, but if you just need a basic install, \r\n\r\n160\r\n00:21:44,033 --> 00:21:50,133\r\nthose steps right there, that's what you need.  Pretty simple, right?  I mean, I really just clicked next a couple of times.  I think the only option I \r\n\r\n161\r\n00:21:50,133 --> 00:22:01,633\r\nchanged was to change the name of the image.  So that's NetInstall.  Let's talk about NetRestore while that's running.  NetRestore is where \r\n\r\n162\r\n00:22:01,633 --> 00:22:12,299\r\ninstead of basing my image off of a Mavericks install disk, like I just did, I can base my image off of a machine, off of a Mac, MacBook, or \r\n\r\n163\r\n00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:22,433\r\nMacPro, or whatever, that I get set up the way that I want.  The way that works is we take a machine, like I'll take this guy over here.  This is \r\n\r\n164\r\n00:22:22,433 --> 00:22:32,999\r\nthat machine that I said I did just a plain install on.  I didn't do anything crazy.  I just did a basic install here, and now I can go in and customize \r\n\r\n165\r\n00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:41,233\r\nit.  So, I start to customize.  I do things like I add Chrome, so maybe I want Google Chrome as a web browser instead of just Safari.  So, I \r\n\r\n166\r\n00:22:41,233 --> 00:22:50,366\r\ncan go in and I can install Chrome, which is apparently going to run incredibly slow [Laughter].  All right, well, maybe I should stick \r\n\r\n167\r\n00:22:50,366 --> 00:22:58,199\r\nwith Safari, right?  Oh, there we go.  So, we can get Chrome installed and so that's what I want my web browser to be for these end users.  You \r\n\r\n168\r\n00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:09,300\r\nknow, don't ask me that.  And so I can get that set up.  I can install other software.  Maybe I've got line of business applications or educational \r\n\r\n169\r\n00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:16,666\r\napplications or whatever that I want to install on here so I can in and start to provide those settings, just get everything set the way that we \r\n\r\n170\r\n00:23:16,666 --> 00:23:26,266\r\nwant.  You know, my son loves this video game called Block Story, so maybe I want to install \rBlock Story on here, right, so I'll go here and \r\n\r\n171\r\n00:23:26,266 --> 00:23:36,699\r\ninstall it.  You, basically, install the applications that you need.  So, we'll go ahead and install this one.  Once it's all set up the way that you \r\n\r\n172\r\n00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:45,700\r\nwant it, then we need to take an image, and this is the tricky part.  You can't take an image of a machine while it's running.  I can't take an image \r\n\r\n173\r\n00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:53,400\r\nof this computer from itself.  It won't let me do that.  You can't build an image from the own machine, so for example, if I were to go in here \r\n\r\n174\r\n00:23:53,400 --> 00:24:10,500\r\nand try and do that, if I were to go into my system and library and core services, there we go, and go into my system image utility, if I can \r\n\r\n175\r\n00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:19,133\r\nfind it.  If I go into my system image utility, on this machine I haven't downloaded the Mavericks installer and I can't pick my own hard drive.  It's \r\n\r\n176\r\n00:24:19,133 --> 00:24:28,133\r\nnot even here in the list.  I can't do it.  So, if I want to do a NetRestore or whatever, it's not going to do it.  Now, notice, it will offer that if I \r\n\r\n177\r\n00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:35,799\r\nhave a recovery partition, I could build a NetRestore image from my recovery partition or I could boot to recovery and take the image that \r\n\r\n178\r\n00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:42,500\r\nway.  That's another way to go about it, but on this machine I don't have a recovery petition and there is no way for me to be able to do it.  So all \r\n\r\n179\r\n00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:51,333\r\nof my options are grayed out.  I can't use the wizard.  So, what I normally do is, I don't like to go the recovery partition way.  It's kind of messy.  \r\n\r\n180\r\n00:24:51,333 --> 00:25:01,066\r\nWhat I like to use is the target mode for Mac.  Every Mac has this really cool setting, and you might not be familiar with it.  When you boot \r\n\r\n181\r\n00:25:01,066 --> 00:25:10,932\r\nyour Mac up, if you hold down the letter T on the keyboard, T for target, if you hold down the letter T, your Mac will boot into target mode.  It \r\n\r\n182\r\n00:25:10,933 --> 00:25:19,633\r\nbasically turns your entire Mac into a removable hard drive and then what you can do is you can run a Firewire or Thunderbolt cable from your \r\n\r\n183\r\n00:25:19,633 --> 00:25:27,499\r\nMac to another Mac and when you plug it into that other Mac the second Mac will see the first Mac as a hard drive.  It will see it as a \r\n\r\n184\r\n00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:35,566\r\nremovable hard drive that's not booted and because it is set up that way you can take an image of it.  It's really easy.  So, if I get my \r\n\r\n185\r\n00:25:35,566 --> 00:25:45,499\r\nlaptop set up just the way that I want, I can shut it down, boot it up holding down the letter T, and when it boots up, I'll see a little icon appear and \r\n\r\n186\r\n00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:53,366\r\nit will either be a Thunderbolt or a Firewire icon.  It depends on your Mac.  On mine, it would be a Thunderbolt icon.  And then I can run my \r\n\r\n187\r\n00:25:53,366 --> 00:26:01,366\r\nThunderbolt cable from this Mac to another one and on that other Mac I could fire up the system image utility and I'd be able to pick this one's \r\n\r\n188\r\n00:26:01,366 --> 00:26:08,932\r\nhard drive.  Okay?  And from there I could make my image and then I could take that image and deploy it out.  So, that target mode is pretty \r\n\r\n189\r\n00:26:08,933 --> 00:26:15,699\r\nhandy.  Target modes are also useful if have a Mac like a laptop where the screen has died and you just want to get your data off of it.  You can \r\n\r\n190\r\n00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:24,333\r\nuse Target mode to kind of get around that.  But one word of advice.  When you go into target mode, your hard drive will show up as whatever \r\n\r\n191\r\n00:26:24,333 --> 00:26:32,066\r\nit's named, so like my hard drive is named Macintosh HD, a pretty common name.  On my other Mac, it's probably going to have a hard \r\n\r\n192\r\n00:26:32,066 --> 00:26:39,999\r\ndrive called Macintosh HD.  So, when I bring this one up in target mode, I'm going to see two hard drives, both called Macintosh HD, so it can get \r\n\r\n193\r\n00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:46,933\r\na little confusion.  To help with that you might want to change the name of your hard drive before you do that, before you go and take it to \r\n\r\n194\r\n00:26:46,933 --> 00:26:54,699\r\nthe other side.  It's up to you.  You don't have to do that because remember I said you can't take an image of a hard drive that you're running from \r\n\r\n195\r\n00:26:54,700 --> 00:27:03,433\r\nso on that second Mac it might have two hard drives now called Macintosh HD but it won't let you image the one for that Mac.  You'd only be \r\n\r\n196\r\n00:27:03,433 --> 00:27:12,166\r\nable to see this one so we don't have to rename it but if you want to you can just jump over into your disc utility and in your disk utility you'll see \r\n\r\n197\r\n00:27:12,166 --> 00:27:20,532\r\nthe option in here where you can come in and rename it.  You see the option in here somewhere.  Actually, am I wrong?  Maybe you \r\n\r\n198\r\n00:27:20,533 --> 00:27:27,466\r\ncan't rename it from in here.  I thought you could.  Yeah, sure enough, you can't rename it from in here.  I guess you learn something new \r\n\r\n199\r\n00:27:27,466 --> 00:27:40,032\r\nevery day.  All right.  Well, hmmm, I could've sworn you could.  All right, well apparently renaming it is not a good option for us, but like I \r\n\r\n200\r\n00:27:40,033 --> 00:27:46,999\r\nsaid, it is kind of hard to get them confused, because it won't let you pick the other one so you at least have a little bit of protection there.  \r\n\r\n201\r\n00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:54,500\r\nAll right so, if I get this machine set up exactly the way that I want, right, so I installed Chrome and I installed Block Story so I've got some little \r\n\r\n202\r\n00:27:54,500 --> 00:28:04,633\r\nprograms there.  Now, I can take this machine, shut it down, boot it into target mode, and I'll be able to take that image of it.  Okay?  So, \r\n\r\n203\r\n00:28:04,633 --> 00:28:11,733\r\nunfortunately, if I shut this thing down and go into target mode, I'm going to lose my little shared video for a minute, so let's do this.  \r\n\r\n204\r\n00:28:11,733 --> 00:28:17,733\r\nLooking at the clock it's about time for a break anyway, let's stop and take a break and during the break, I'll boot it up into target mode and \r\n\r\n205\r\n00:28:17,733 --> 00:28:24,566\r\nhook it to that other system and when we come back from break, I'll be ready to take that image.  So this is a pretty good spot to stop for that.  \r\n\r\n206\r\n00:28:24,566 --> 00:28:27,166\r\nSo, stay tuned.  We'll be back in a few.  \r\n\r\n207\r\n00:28:27,166 --> 00:28:35,199\r\n[Music]  \r\n\r\n208\r\n00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:41,166\r\nAll right, welcome back, every body.  So, during the break, I went ahead and took my work station, shut it down, and booted it up holding \r\n\r\n209\r\n00:28:41,166 --> 00:28:50,899\r\nthe letter T on my keyboard to go into target mode.  Now that it is in target mode, I've plugged it into the back of my server, and I'm \r\n\r\n210\r\n00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:58,700\r\nready to create a NetRestore image of it.  Now, when you boot up, you're going see something interesting.  Well, I guess it kind of depends on \r\n\r\n211\r\n00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:07,366\r\nhow you have your desktop set up what you're going to see.  I've got this snap to grid turned on.  Let me turn that off.  I've actually got two \r\n\r\n212\r\n00:29:07,366 --> 00:29:13,832\r\nMacintosh HDs now.  I didn't see that at first because they were sitting right on top of each other, but they were there.  One of them is for \r\n\r\n213\r\n00:29:13,833 --> 00:29:21,433\r\nmy server, and one of them is for my other work station that I've hooked up in target mode.  They both have the same name.  I didn't rename \r\n\r\n214\r\n00:29:21,433 --> 00:29:27,833\r\nthem.  You know, now that I think about it, at the end of the last segment, I was trying to rename them in Disk Utility, which I could've sworn you \r\n\r\n215\r\n00:29:27,833 --> 00:29:34,466\r\ndid it from there, but just for your reference, if you ever need to rename a volume, you can do it right from the finder.  It's actually easier than I \r\n\r\n216\r\n00:29:34,466 --> 00:29:44,132\r\nwas making it out to be.  You can find your disk and if you right click or two-finger click, you can get that rename Macintosh HD right there.  So, \r\n\r\n217\r\n00:29:44,133 --> 00:29:52,133\r\nhad I renamed it, I would know which one of these was my server versus which one of these was my machine I'm trying to clone but if I ever \r\n\r\n218\r\n00:29:52,133 --> 00:30:00,366\r\nneed to just find out real quick, if you open them up, see how they both contain the same contents because they both have Mac OS \r\n\r\n219\r\n00:30:00,366 --> 00:30:08,632\r\ninstalled on them but notice how the folders here have icons on them for applications, library, and so on but up here they're all just blank folders.  \r\n\r\n220\r\n00:30:08,633 --> 00:30:17,299\r\nOkay?  Well, what that means is that these are the active folders for my current running operating system versus these, which are \r\n\r\n221\r\n00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:23,666\r\nfolders for some other operating system that is not the current one running.  It's a quick, easy way to visually identify which one is your hard \r\n\r\n222\r\n00:30:23,666 --> 00:30:31,932\r\ndrive versus which one is the target system you just plugged in.  Now, once I get, I guess I don't even really need to know which is which \r\n\r\n223\r\n00:30:31,933 --> 00:30:39,666\r\nbecause when we run the system image utility here in a few minutes it won't let you image the hard drive that you booted from.  So, I booted \r\n\r\n224\r\n00:30:39,666 --> 00:30:51,066\r\nfrom this drive right.  It won't let me image that, so this will be the only Macintosh HD in the list.  So, at this stage, I'm ready to take an image of \r\n\r\n225\r\n00:30:51,066 --> 00:30:57,666\r\nthat other machine so I can then deploy it out across my network and it'll have the Chrome web browser and Block Story installed and all \r\n\r\n226\r\n00:30:57,666 --> 00:31:07,299\r\nthat other good stuff will be ready to rock.  So, I am going to go ahead and dive into my hard drive and you know having two hard drives with \r\n\r\n227\r\n00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:16,200\r\nthe same name is always kind of a pain in the butt.  I'm going to browse in here into my system and library and core services and I'm \r\n\r\n228\r\n00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:25,133\r\ngoing to hunt down my system image utility.  Hear it is.  And when I fire that up, it's going to find that MacIntosh HD.  Mine's actually finding \r\n\r\n229\r\n00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:32,033\r\ntwo Mavericks installers now because there is one on my hard drive and one on that hard drive so now I get two choices.  And, you know, if we \r\n\r\n230\r\n00:31:32,033 --> 00:31:38,799\r\nchoose one of those Mavericks installers, say we've got all three options that we talked about in the first segment, but when I choose \r\n\r\n231\r\n00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:47,366\r\nMacIntosh HD, I lose the ability to do NetInstalls because NetInstalls are built from the installed media not built from a hard drive but I still \r\n\r\n232\r\n00:31:47,366 --> 00:31:56,366\r\nhave NetBoot, if I wanted to do that or NetRestore, which is what I want.  We can continue forward, and we give it a name and it \r\n\r\n233\r\n00:31:56,366 --> 00:32:05,332\r\nbuilds the image just like it built the one from the installer.  Not much difference there.  Now the process takes longer to build a NetRestore \r\n\r\n234\r\n00:32:05,333 --> 00:32:15,066\r\nimage, and the reason is the size of the data.  The install disc or the .dmg file for Mavericks was 5.5 GB in size, so that's how big that is, \r\n\r\n235\r\n00:32:15,066 --> 00:32:24,899\r\nbut my hard drive here from that other machine, I've booted it up, I did a bunch of updates, I updated to 10.9.4, I installed Chrome and Block \r\n\r\n236\r\n00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:32,333\r\nStory, you know, so it ended up being 15.7 GB so the larger that data the longer it's going to take to backup so I could go ahead and hit \r\n\r\n237\r\n00:32:32,333 --> 00:32:40,666\r\ncreate here and it would run through that process.  But before I do that, I want to do one other thing.  When we create these, if we just \r\n\r\n238\r\n00:32:40,666 --> 00:32:50,366\r\nwant a straight-up clone of the original machine, then we're done here.  We just hit create and we let it run, but more often than not, we want to \r\n\r\n239\r\n00:32:50,366 --> 00:32:58,466\r\ncustomize things at least a little bit and there are a lot of options in here that we can customize.  You just don't see them by default.  \r\n\r\n240\r\n00:32:58,466 --> 00:33:07,699\r\nIf I go back a screen, back here, where I've got that I'm cloning my Mac HD, I choose NetRestore, you'll see this customize button, \r\n\r\n241\r\n00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:16,133\r\nand what we can do is if we hit customize, we can agree to the end user license agreement and then we get an Automator work flow.  You \r\n\r\n242\r\n00:33:16,133 --> 00:33:24,299\r\ncan create an Automator work flow that allows you to add in all sorts of custom activities to change the image that you're about to deploy, \r\n\r\n243\r\n00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:31,533\r\nand so what I want to do is I want to walk through a few of these until we get close to break time and when we get to break I'll start \r\n\r\n244\r\n00:33:31,533 --> 00:33:39,266\r\nthis image process running so it can run over the break and be there when we get back.  So, let's walk through a few things on this, and you \r\n\r\n245\r\n00:33:39,266 --> 00:33:45,866\r\nknow what, I'm doing this here on a NetRestore image.  I could have done this on the NetInstall image, also.  Just because we're building off of \r\n\r\n246\r\n00:33:45,866 --> 00:33:54,199\r\nthat official Mac OS installer from Apple doesn't  mean we have to be the default install.  We have all these Automator libraries available to us \r\n\r\n247\r\n00:33:54,200 --> 00:34:00,900\r\nthere, too.  So, you've got a ton of choices when you go to do your initial install, if you want to build off the disk or if you want to build off a \r\n\r\n248\r\n00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:08,200\r\nsource machine, like I'm doing here.  A few things to note before we start to work with it.  The way the Automator activities work is really \r\n\r\n249\r\n00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:17,433\r\nsimple.  You find the one you want on the right and you just drag it and drop it over here.  The work flow right now is just two steps.  Step one: \r\n\r\n250\r\n00:34:17,433 --> 00:34:23,933\r\nDefine your image source.  That was the drop-down box on the first page of the wizard.  Step two:  Create the image.  That's what we're telling \r\n\r\n251\r\n00:34:23,933 --> 00:34:33,766\r\nit to do as we run through that wizard.  If we want to manipulate it, we can drag and drop any of these activities over here and drop them in the \r\n\r\n252\r\n00:34:33,766 --> 00:34:41,432\r\nmiddle of that work flow.  Now that's important.  It's got to go in between define image source and create image.  Anything in between will be \r\n\r\n253\r\n00:34:41,433 --> 00:34:48,566\r\nrun.  If you drag and drop something to the bottom down here, let's say I take this one.  I'll just drag and drop it down here to the bottom.  It \r\n\r\n254\r\n00:34:48,566 --> 00:35:00,066\r\nwill let you do it but notice what it did.  You can see the little triangle and half circle right there that shows those two are connected.  See how \r\n\r\n255\r\n00:35:00,066 --> 00:35:07,299\r\nthere's no symbol right there.  This is an activity that will never get executed and actually it will cause the work flow to fail.  So if I were to leave \r\n\r\n256\r\n00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:14,433\r\nit like this, it's going to fail and it's not going to work.  So its important that these go in between and when they go in between see how it \r\n\r\n257\r\n00:35:14,433 --> 00:35:24,066\r\nconnected it to that process?  It will define the image source.  It'll take these actions and then it'll create the image.  Now, by default it's \r\n\r\n258\r\n00:35:24,066 --> 00:35:30,132\r\nshowing us some of the really common ones over here.  So that's usually what we want is what's here in this list, and you'll see there's like \r\n\r\n259\r\n00:35:30,133 --> 00:35:37,333\r\nthis most used, recently added.  And some of these there's a lot of duplicates that are in here.  Some of these you may need, some of these \r\n\r\n260\r\n00:35:37,333 --> 00:35:43,566\r\nyou don't, but the ones that are on the exam are the ones that are right here under just the default library screen.  These are the important \r\n\r\n261\r\n00:35:43,566 --> 00:35:52,432\r\nones.  So, lets walk through a few of these.  Add configuration profiles, I'm going to hold off on that one.  We've got an entire section on \r\n\r\n262\r\n00:35:52,433 --> 00:36:00,733\r\npolicies and policies that we can push out to machines.  So, we're going to see that.  I think it's episode 3 or 4.  What is that one?  Yeah, \r\n\r\n263\r\n00:36:00,733 --> 00:36:07,366\r\nepisode 4, where we'll do policy management.  So, I'll tackle that one on that side.  We've got a few others.  In fact, let me, I'll just go out of \r\n\r\n264\r\n00:36:07,366 --> 00:36:14,866\r\norder here so I can get the ones that I really want.  We've got like add user account.  When I cloned that client that I made there were some \r\n\r\n265\r\n00:36:14,866 --> 00:36:21,299\r\nuser accounts on it.  Well, what if this is going to be an image I'm giving to somebody who wasn't on that original machine?  I may want to \r\n\r\n266\r\n00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:28,866\r\nadd user accounts, and I can do it right here.  If I've got local user accounts, great, I can whip them up using add user.  What if I have a \r\n\r\n267\r\n00:36:28,866 --> 00:36:38,532\r\ndirectory.  What if I have open LDAP or an open directory running on my OS X server.  Well, if that's the case, I can go to to apply system \r\n\r\n268\r\n00:36:38,533 --> 00:36:45,766\r\nconfiguration settings, and in that one, it will give me the option to connect to my directory server.  Let's take a look at each of these.  I'll take add a \r\n\r\n269\r\n00:36:45,766 --> 00:36:54,166\r\nuser account and drag that one out here, and you can see I can do a name, short name, password, so I could create an account for Don \r\n\r\n270\r\n00:36:54,166 --> 00:37:05,199\r\nPezet.  I could set the short name to be Don Pezet and set a password to be whatever I want it to be.  Set that hint, password in plain text, \r\n\r\n271\r\n00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:12,566\r\nthere we go, and I can specify whether that user is an administrator or not and whether they should log in automatically.  So, I can define \r\n\r\n272\r\n00:37:12,566 --> 00:37:20,932\r\nthat here.  If I want more than one user, I just drag that over more than one time.  So, now it's going to add multiple users, and we can even \r\n\r\n273\r\n00:37:20,933 --> 00:37:27,566\r\nget as detailed as to change their icon in case you don't like the gingerbread man that it picked by default.  I can go in here and pick something \r\n\r\n274\r\n00:37:27,566 --> 00:37:35,899\r\nelse, chalkboard, there.  All right, so, we can start to add those users, get them put into the system.  I think I already have a user called Don \r\n\r\n275\r\n00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:48,033\r\nPezet, so I'll add somebody else.  Let me add Christopher Walken.  He's my normal test user, so there we go.  Now, if instead I chose applied \r\n\r\n276\r\n00:37:48,033 --> 00:37:56,066\r\nsystem configuration settings, this has quite a few options in there, but the main option I'm concerned about is this guy, connect computers \r\n\r\n277\r\n00:37:56,066 --> 00:38:03,866\r\nto directory servers.  If I have a directory server somewhere where my user accounts are stored, I can specify it right here and it'll connect up.  \r\n\r\n278\r\n00:38:03,866 --> 00:38:12,199\r\nSo, I can add that in and specify who that server is going to be and the other information about it, you know whatever that system is.  Now in my \r\n\r\n279\r\n00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:20,266\r\ncase, the server that I'm on is a directory server, so it's already picked that up and so I could punch that in specifying a username and \r\n\r\n280\r\n00:38:20,266 --> 00:38:28,899\r\npassword to bind with and it would get connected.  You'll also see apply computer name and local host name settings from a file.  I \r\n\r\n281\r\n00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:35,066\r\ncan pull a username from a file stored somewhere else or a computer name so the computer is named something different.  If you \r\n\r\n282\r\n00:38:35,066 --> 00:38:41,466\r\nare going to deploying this image to 1000 machines, you don't want them all to have the same name.  You could also say generate \r\n\r\n283\r\n00:38:41,466 --> 00:38:52,166\r\nunique computer name starting with, and if you do something like this, if you say lab machine, then it's going to generate unique names that \r\n\r\n284\r\n00:38:52,166 --> 00:38:59,766\r\nare lab machine- and then a unique number.  So now, you'll be able to recognize them on the network because they'll be called lab machine- \r\n\r\n285\r\n00:38:59,766 --> 00:39:09,466\r\nsomething.  So those are some useful settings there.  I'll go ahead and leave this one set this way to say I want to call them lab machine so \r\n\r\n286\r\n00:39:09,466 --> 00:39:21,432\r\non.  Some of the other options that we may see over here, some of the more useful ones, let's see, I think I've got a list of useful ones.  \r\n\r\n287\r\n00:39:21,433 --> 00:39:28,899\r\nPartition disk, partition disk is a good one.  It's actually the last one here in the list.  By default, we're just going to partition out the whole hard \r\n\r\n288\r\n00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:36,966\r\ndrive as one big partition.  But maybe I want more than that.  Maybe I want some different kind of hard drive layout so I can drag that over \r\n\r\n289\r\n00:39:36,966 --> 00:39:44,099\r\nand specify how I want to partition it.  Maybe I want two partitions when I deploy this image.  And so when I do that, I can come in and I can \r\n\r\n290\r\n00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:54,466\r\nspecify the size of the partitions, the names of the partitions, so maybe I want partition 1 to be called Macintosh HD, but I want partition 2 to be \r\n\r\n291\r\n00:39:54,466 --> 00:40:03,432\r\ncalled Storage.  So now, when this image is deployed, it will have two hard drives, two partitions, Macintosh HD, and Storage, and I \r\n\r\n292\r\n00:40:03,433 --> 00:40:12,866\r\ncan specify I want Macintosh HD to have an absolute size of 50 GB.  So, I want it to be 50 GB in size.  That's big enough for OS X and \r\n\r\n293\r\n00:40:12,866 --> 00:40:21,366\r\nsome applications, and then I can go to Storage and I can say percentage of available disk 100%.  In other words, take whatever other hard \r\n\r\n294\r\n00:40:21,366 --> 00:40:30,199\r\ndrive space the system has and add it to a partition called Storage.  Some of the other things we can do, we can say partition the first \r\n\r\n295\r\n00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:37,533\r\ndisk found, so if there's more than one disk, it'll just do the first disk. That's a nice setting because if there's data on the other disks, it'll \r\n\r\n296\r\n00:40:37,533 --> 00:40:45,199\r\npreserve it.  We don't necessarily want to lose the user's data, if they've stored it on other hard drives.  We can even limit it to a specific name.  \r\n\r\n297\r\n00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:55,666\r\nWe can say look for one called Macintosh HD, and that's what we're looking for.  If we find disks with other partition names, don't mess with \r\n\r\n298\r\n00:40:55,666 --> 00:41:03,366\r\nthem.  And my favorite is this one, display confirmation dialogue before partitioning.  You want to make sure that users know hey, if it's \r\n\r\n299\r\n00:41:03,366 --> 00:41:10,766\r\ngoing to partition, I'm going to lose data, so you don't necessarily want that.  Now, if we don't do this, if we don't partition the disk, then when we \r\n\r\n300\r\n00:41:10,766 --> 00:41:18,899\r\npush this image out, as long as they're running a modern version of Mac OS then it will actually apply on top and preserve the user data, so \r\n\r\n301\r\n00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:28,366\r\nthat's kind of nice.  I'm going to go ahead and leave these options kind of the way they are here.  I will remove that confirmation warning.  \r\n\r\n302\r\n00:41:28,366 --> 00:41:36,899\r\nSome of the other ones we might want.  Let's see that was partition disk.  We did add user.  Filter computer.  So, here we've got like filter \r\n\r\n303\r\n00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:45,366\r\ncomputer models, when you create an image like this, the idea is that we could roll it out to tons of machines.  Well, there may be some \r\n\r\n304\r\n00:41:45,366 --> 00:41:51,799\r\nolder machines on your network that you don't want this image to apply to.  Maybe you've got some old iMacs or something like that and you \r\n\r\n305\r\n00:41:51,800 --> 00:42:00,000\r\ndon't want this dropped down on those.  So, you can drag this filter computer models out, and in here you can specify what systems you want to \r\n\r\n306\r\n00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:06,333\r\nallow to get it.  Now it does a pretty good job of filtering out systems on its own, but you'll see some old ones in here as you scroll around.  \r\n\r\n307\r\n00:42:06,333 --> 00:42:13,199\r\nThere's some iMacs in there, so you've got some 2007 machines.  Those are pretty old, at this point, but you can scroll through here and \r\n\r\n308\r\n00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:21,200\r\nspot them, and so you can just check off the ones that you want to allow or don't want to allow and start to restrict that and protect your \r\n\r\n309\r\n00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:30,600\r\nsystem.  So, these people, when they go to install the image, they won't even see this option because it's filtered out for them.  The default is \r\n\r\n310\r\n00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:36,933\r\nthat all of these are unchecked, so you are actually enabling them.  You check the ones that you want to be able to deploy this machine \r\n\r\n311\r\n00:42:36,933 --> 00:42:47,066\r\nto.  I'm going to go ahead and drop that out.  Some of the other things, let's see.  We talked about apply system configuration settings.  Oh, \r\n\r\n312\r\n00:42:47,066 --> 00:42:56,966\r\nhere is an important one, the packages.  Add Packages and Post-Install Scripts.  When I created this image, I haven't created it yet but \r\n\r\n313\r\n00:42:56,966 --> 00:43:05,199\r\nI'm about to create this image, I'm imaging a machine that I already had set up, and I had installed Chrome and a few other apps and done \r\n\r\n314\r\n00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:13,833\r\nsome basic things to it.  Well, what happens later on if I decide I want to change that image, I want to add some more software to it?  Well, \r\n\r\n315\r\n00:43:13,833 --> 00:43:22,733\r\nwhat I would have to do is deploy the image to a machine, make the changes, and then rebuild the image again.  That's kind of a pain to go \r\n\r\n316\r\n00:43:22,733 --> 00:43:30,099\r\nthrough that, you know, to basically deploy and rebuild that image any time I want to change it.  So I actually have the option right here to add \r\n\r\n317\r\n00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:40,400\r\nPackages and Post-Install Scripts to existing image, if I want.  I can come in and I can throw this in and I can start to add updated software.  I \r\n\r\n318\r\n00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:48,566\r\ncan add scripts to run and so on, and I don't have to rebuild my image.  This will just tack on to what's already there, really useful for doing \r\n\r\n319\r\n00:43:48,566 --> 00:43:56,866\r\nupdates and adding new software.  The one little caveat, this will not accept .dmg's and installers like drag-and-drop applications, which is \r\n\r\n320\r\n00:43:56,866 --> 00:44:06,199\r\nunfortunately how most apps are packaged these days.  It only supports apps that are in the package format, the .pkg format, and you \r\n\r\n321\r\n00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:14,866\r\nmay have noticed some of the applications that I had were already in that .pkg format so like that Block Story that I threw in there is a .pkg or I've \r\n\r\n322\r\n00:44:14,866 --> 00:44:23,899\r\ngot SilverLight that's a .pkg.  But look at Chrome here.  I've got Google Chrome, and it's just a .dmg and if I try and open that, when I crack it \r\n\r\n323\r\n00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:33,466\r\nopen, I see the standard drag the application and drop it in the folder thing.  Well, what that is, if I come in here and look at it, it's actually \r\n\r\n324\r\n00:44:33,466 --> 00:44:43,232\r\ngooglechrome.app, and that's not suitable for what this needs.  So not every application is packaged right for that.  It doesn't mean you're \r\n\r\n325\r\n00:44:43,233 --> 00:44:52,099\r\nout of luck, though.  There are third-party software.  They list them in the .pdf, but just to kind of show you, there are a couple of different \r\n\r\n326\r\n00:44:52,100 --> 00:45:03,700\r\ncompanies out there that make software that will let you build .pkg files.  So one of them is these guys right here, JAMF Software.  They have \r\n\r\n327\r\n00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:09,066\r\nseveral different products that are out there.  They have one that's called Composer.  Let's see if I can find it on here.  Here we go, \r\n\r\n328\r\n00:45:09,066 --> 00:45:20,732\r\nComposer, and Composer will let you, there we go, will let you build a .pkg file.  So, you install your application, you run Composer, and it will \r\n\r\n329\r\n00:45:20,733 --> 00:45:33,999\r\nbuild the .pkg so that you can go that way.  Another one out there is Iceberg and Packages.  Let's see if we can get that one.  There.  So this \r\n\r\n330\r\n00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:40,933\r\nis another one.  This one is open source, so it's free.  It's kind of nice, and it does the same thing.  It lets you build those .pkg files.  So, you \r\n\r\n331\r\n00:45:40,933 --> 00:45:49,699\r\ntake your own laptop or whatever.  You install the application, and you build the .pkg file, and once you've got that, once you've got the .pkg, \r\n\r\n332\r\n00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:56,033\r\nyou can take that and you just throw it right in here.  You can drag-and-drop it or you can use the little plus sign to browse and find it and \r\n\r\n333\r\n00:45:56,033 --> 00:46:03,866\r\nthrow in your Package files.  So that's a pretty useful one, and it's actually something that Apple recommends.  Apple, in their terminology, \r\n\r\n334\r\n00:46:03,866 --> 00:46:12,532\r\nwhen you build images, you have two different kinds.  You have monolithic images and modular images.  A monolithic image, that's one big fat \r\n\r\n335\r\n00:46:12,533 --> 00:46:19,533\r\nimage that has everything that you need inside of it. That's one where you install a machine, you get it set up exactly how you want it, and \r\n\r\n336\r\n00:46:19,533 --> 00:46:25,766\r\nyou build an image, and the problem with that is every time you want to update, you've got to rebuild the image so it'a a lot of work.  A modular \r\n\r\n337\r\n00:46:25,766 --> 00:46:34,166\r\nimage is where your image is very, very small, usually a NetInstall.  So, just the Mavericks installer and that's it.  So, you build a very small \r\n\r\n338\r\n00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:43,499\r\nimage and then you use Add Packages and Post-Install Scripts to add whatever you want to it and so you can quickly build images for your \r\n\r\n339\r\n00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:49,333\r\nsales department, your marketing department, your executives that have different software and you're not having to build a whole new image \r\n\r\n340\r\n00:46:49,333 --> 00:46:55,933\r\nbecause you're just using the Mavericks installer each time and adding the appropriate software.  That's called a modular image.  They're a lot \r\n\r\n341\r\n00:46:55,933 --> 00:47:03,299\r\nmore flexible, if you have frequently changing images.  So it's pretty handy, and if an update for software comes out, you just run this \r\n\r\n342\r\n00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:11,600\r\nprocess again, you remove the old package, you add in your new package,  and you're done.  Let's see, what else do we have?  That was \r\n\r\n343\r\n00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:20,766\r\nPackages and Post-Install Scripts.  We've got image numbers I want to talk about a little bit later.  Configuration profiles I said I would talk \r\n\r\n344\r\n00:47:20,766 --> 00:47:31,166\r\nabout later.  Automated Installation, you'll see over here it is right here.  Enable automated Installation.  This is another one.  By default, \r\n\r\n345\r\n00:47:31,166 --> 00:47:37,732\r\nwhen they fire this up, there are going to be a couple of little questions they're going to get, not many, but one of the main questions they'll get \r\n\r\n346\r\n00:47:37,733 --> 00:47:45,699\r\nis what hard drive do you want to install to.  If we want to automate that so they don't even get asked that question, we add enable Automated \r\n\r\n347\r\n00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:55,133\r\nInstallation and we can choose which volume we want to install to.  And so we can specify that right here, and you can say erase before \r\n\r\n348\r\n00:47:55,133 --> 00:48:02,266\r\ninstalling or don't erase.  If you don't erase, it will preserve the user's data as long as they're running a modern version of Mac OS, but if you \r\n\r\n349\r\n00:48:02,266 --> 00:48:09,766\r\ndo choose to erase, it will get a good, clean install and that will be the end of it.  So, that's another little step there we can use to automate \r\n\r\n350\r\n00:48:09,766 --> 00:48:15,266\r\nit.  Now, it really is just removing that one step.  Most of the rest of this is going to go automatic anyway.  That ones a lot more useful when \r\n\r\n351\r\n00:48:15,266 --> 00:48:22,266\r\nyou're doing a NetInstall because by default with NetInstall, they get all the questions, as they go through.  With enabled Automated Installation, \r\n\r\n352\r\n00:48:22,266 --> 00:48:28,932\r\nas long as you're adding a user account, also, like I'm doing up here, and you specify the volume here, they really don't get asked \r\n\r\n353\r\n00:48:28,933 --> 00:48:38,333\r\nanything.  It churns through and does the install.  All they had to do was start it.  That's really it.  So, that does make life a lot easier.  All right, I \r\n\r\n354\r\n00:48:38,333 --> 00:48:45,099\r\nthink those are basically the settings that I wanted to talk about.  There is one more thing that I do want talk about, but I'm holding off on it \r\n\r\n355\r\n00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:53,700\r\nbecause I want to cover it in depth, and we'll do that after the break.  So, it is just a few minutes here before the end of the segment, so it's \r\n\r\n356\r\n00:48:53,700 --> 00:49:00,000\r\nprobably a pretty good time for me to start this image.  I'm going to leave some of this stuff in here, so I am going to leave add a user account, \r\n\r\n357\r\n00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:05,800\r\nso, you know, we should see that Christopher Walken account get created.  I'm going to get rid of Automated Install.  I want us to see the \r\n\r\n358\r\n00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:13,666\r\nwhole thing, and I didn't add any packages.  I'll leave the disk partitioning, so we should be able to see that happen, too. And, I'm not going to \r\n\r\n359\r\n00:49:13,666 --> 00:49:23,232\r\nbond to my server, yet, and we want to create that image.  Okay.  So, I'm going to leave that information there.  All I have to do, now, is hit \r\n\r\n360\r\n00:49:23,233 --> 00:49:28,133\r\nthis run button down here and it's going to run the script.  I am going to change one more thing.  The save to option is defaulting to a weird \r\n\r\n361\r\n00:49:28,133 --> 00:49:38,166\r\nfolder, so I just want to move that to my image storage folder, and I'm going to rename my image so that I can call it \r\n\r\n362\r\n00:49:38,166 --> 00:49:58,432\r\nNetRestore of OSX-Client1.  There.  I'm going to go ahead and do that, and I'll go ahead and hit run.  We do need to be an administrator to run \r\n\r\n363\r\n00:49:58,433 --> 00:50:07,633\r\nthe Automator tasks.  I'll say okay, and I can see it kind of whirling away down there, as it kicks off to run that script, and it's going to \r\n\r\n364\r\n00:50:07,633 --> 00:50:15,933\r\nchurn through and we should be in business.  So, we'll give it a moment.  Now, it is going to be building that image.  It will take it a little while.  If \r\n\r\n365\r\n00:50:15,933 --> 00:50:24,266\r\nI were to browse into my image storage, we can start to see it make it.  It's really important that you don't mess with the disk while it's building \r\n\r\n366\r\n00:50:24,266 --> 00:50:30,066\r\nthe image.  It is is a little sensitive to that, so if I were to browse in that folder and start poking around I can cause some problems so I'm just \r\n\r\n367\r\n00:50:30,066 --> 00:50:36,232\r\ngoing to let it be.  So let it be and let it run.  That's the only negative about doing it the Automator way is you don't really get a status \r\n\r\n368\r\n00:50:36,233 --> 00:50:42,599\r\nbar; you just get your whirling circle, whereas, if I had done it the old-fashioned way and just ran through the wizard, I would have a nice little \r\n\r\n369\r\n00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:50,433\r\nstatus bar right here.  But, we'll sit and let it run, and we'll take a break.  When we get back, we'll see the finished result, and then I want to talk a \r\n\r\n370\r\n00:50:50,433 --> 00:50:57,566\r\nlittle bit about image numbers, too.  So that's something we'll tackle after the break.  All right, so stay tuned.  We'll be back in a few.  [\r\n\r\n371\r\n00:50:57,566 --> 00:51:04,932\r\nMusic]  \r\n\r\n372\r\n00:51:04,933 --> 00:51:13,766\r\nWelcome back.  All right, during the break, we sat here and we watched a little wheel spin for what seemed like forever.  It took it about, oh, I \r\n\r\n373\r\n00:51:13,766 --> 00:51:19,966\r\ndon't know, about 20 minutes or so and then it finished.  It's not very dramatic.  You have that little spinning wheel that spends for a while \r\n\r\n374\r\n00:51:19,966 --> 00:51:27,566\r\ndown here and then it just goes away.  So, you don't get a lot of visual confirmation\rletting you know that it is done.  But it is done.  \r\n\r\n375\r\n00:51:27,566 --> 00:51:37,199\r\nIt copied that hard drive, created an image file, and modified it according to the Automator work flow that we specified up here.  So it's now \r\n\r\n376\r\n00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:47,266\r\nmodified and it's ready to be deployed and if I browse on that hard drive I can find if I go to my internal, where is my image storage here.  I've \r\n\r\n377\r\n00:51:47,266 --> 00:51:56,832\r\ngot that NetRestore of OSX-Client1.mbi so that's that restore image that it made and I can browse in there and I can see my NetInstall.dmg.  That's \r\n\r\n378\r\n00:51:56,833 --> 00:52:05,299\r\nthe image and then some other files that are related to the NetBoot portion of that.  So, it's made it.  I've got it, and there we go.  Now, that \r\n\r\n379\r\n00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:17,166\r\nis a modified deployment.  I could've created an image just by going back and not hitting that customized button.  If I don't hit customize, if I \r\n\r\n380\r\n00:52:17,166 --> 00:52:24,499\r\njust choose to do a NetRestore of that Macintosh hard drive, there we go, and hit continue, that's where we're doing just a s\r\n\r\n381\r\n00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:32,166\r\ntraight-up clone and so I might want to do that and just rename this as a  clone of OSX-Client1 and clone it that way, and we can go there.  \r\n\r\n382\r\n00:52:32,166 --> 00:52:39,566\r\nThe thing is when you do it that way, you're not really modifying anything, so same user, same application, same everything versus when we do \r\n\r\n383\r\n00:52:39,566 --> 00:52:48,332\r\nthe customize button where we can tweak it and set whatever we want.  Now, one option that I didn't mention, or I sort of mentioned but didn't \r\n\r\n384\r\n00:52:48,333 --> 00:52:57,866\r\ncover before the break, was an image index or an image number.  When you customize an image, you'll see this little box over here, an \r\n\r\n385\r\n00:52:57,866 --> 00:53:06,099\r\nimage index.  What the heck is that?  Well, when we go to deploy these images, there's an assumption that the system makes that you're \r\n\r\n386\r\n00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:12,700\r\ngoing to be storing all these images on one server and making them available out to your clients and so your clients will get a list of all \r\n\r\n387\r\n00:53:12,700 --> 00:53:20,700\r\nthose images from that one server.  Well, each image needs to have its own unique number, and you're normally going to see a number \r\n\r\n388\r\n00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:29,633\r\nbetween 1 and 4095.  That's what you're normally going to see.  I can see this one's image number 1245.  I didn't pick that.  It picked \r\n\r\n389\r\n00:53:29,633 --> 00:53:39,866\r\nit on it's own.  In fact, it'll make these up just kind of on its own for each of the images that you do.  If I go back and maybe I'll do a \r\n\r\n390\r\n00:53:39,866 --> 00:53:51,766\r\nNetInstall image this time and I go to customize it.  When I go to do that, see how it's got image index 2508, and if I go back and redo like that \r\n\r\n391\r\n00:53:51,766 --> 00:54:00,132\r\nhard drive, again, for a NetRestore, now I'll see that it's switched to 2489.  So, it's just basically picking a number, and it's picking a number \r\n\r\n392\r\n00:54:00,133 --> 00:54:07,866\r\nbetween 1 and 4095.  It's picking a number so that we can keep all of these images apart so we that we know the differences because you \r\n\r\n393\r\n00:54:07,866 --> 00:54:15,366\r\nmight have two images with the same name, so you might give the image name and make it the same between two images for whatever reason \r\n\r\n394\r\n00:54:15,366 --> 00:54:22,899\r\nso it needs to be able to tell them apart.  There is another reason why we might have an image number.  I said the image number will normally \r\n\r\n395\r\n00:54:22,900 --> 00:54:34,833\r\nbe between 1 and 4095.  What if I want to have that image stored on more than one server?  What if I have thousands of machines and I'm \r\n\r\n396\r\n00:54:34,833 --> 00:54:40,566\r\ngoing to be pushing out so many images that no one server can handle the load, because, you know, all these machines are going to be \r\n\r\n397\r\n00:54:40,566 --> 00:54:46,699\r\ndownloading that image.  It'll get overburdened.  So, you might want to set up more than one server to do load balancing so that all of your \r\n\r\n398\r\n00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:53,966\r\nimages are stored across more than one server.  If you're going to store the image on more than one server, we need some way to tell those \r\n\r\n399\r\n00:54:53,966 --> 00:55:02,366\r\nservers that the image is the same, that it is the same image on each one.  So, the way we do that is by changing this image number to be \r\n\r\n400\r\n00:55:02,366 --> 00:55:12,432\r\nsomething higher; 1 through 4095, that's what we use for images that are stored on one server and one server only, and when you ran through \r\n\r\n401\r\n00:55:12,433 --> 00:55:19,733\r\nthat wizard, one of the things it asks, like if I chose to do a NetRestore image of the Macintosh hard drive and I hit continue, see how \r\n\r\n402\r\n00:55:19,733 --> 00:55:26,133\r\nI've got this checkmark here that says image will be served for more than one server?  By default, it's not checked and that means just use an \r\n\r\n403\r\n00:55:26,133 --> 00:55:35,366\r\nimage ID 1 through 4095, but if you check that and say yes it's going to be served from more than one server, it's going to use a number from \r\n\r\n404\r\n00:55:35,366 --> 00:55:48,466\r\n4096 through 65,535.  It's going to pick a number, and in binary these are 16-bit numbers.  That's why it endes at 65,535, but it will pick a \r\n\r\n405\r\n00:55:48,466 --> 00:56:00,366\r\nnumber between 4096 and 65,535 and when it picks a number like that, if I store this image on five different servers, I can give it the same \r\n\r\n406\r\n00:56:00,366 --> 00:56:07,966\r\nimage number on each of the five different servers, and the servers will know that it's the same image.  Now, when I say it like that, it \r\n\r\n407\r\n00:56:07,966 --> 00:56:14,099\r\nsounds really confusing.  Let me show you it kind of written down.  It makes a little more sense.  I've got, let me bring up my show notes.  \r\n\r\n408\r\n00:56:14,100 --> 00:56:21,233\r\nI'm going to post these show notes with the episodes, so things like URLs and stuff that I've shown on the screen will be in there, like here \r\n\r\n409\r\n00:56:21,233 --> 00:56:30,933\r\nyou can see that URLs for creating those .pkg files.  Well, for the image indexes, let's say that I worked at a school, and at my school I had a \r\n\r\n410\r\n00:56:30,933 --> 00:56:38,333\r\nnumber of images that I wanted to make.  I had an image for teacher computers.  I had an image for middle school students.  I had an image for \r\n\r\n411\r\n00:56:38,333 --> 00:56:45,033\r\nelementary school students and for high school students, and I had another image that was a little more generic that I used for lab machines.  \r\n\r\n412\r\n00:56:45,033 --> 00:56:52,899\r\nSo, maybe the teacher computers, there was one teacher computer in each classroom and I had 50 classrooms so I would never image more \r\n\r\n413\r\n00:56:52,900 --> 00:57:01,100\r\nthan 50 machines, so I could go ahead and put that image on one server and I put that on server 1 and I give it image number 1.  And then middle \r\n\r\n414\r\n00:57:01,100 --> 00:57:08,500\r\nschool student computers, maybe these are computers that are actually in the classrooms and I've only got two, two computers in each \r\n\r\n415\r\n00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:16,466\r\nclassroom in the middle school so maybe I've got just 50 of those, so, again, it can reside right there on a single server and I give it image ID 2 \r\n\r\n416\r\n00:57:16,466 --> 00:57:22,966\r\nWell, high school and elementary school, same thing.  These are two computers in each classroom and so maybe I've got 50 of each of \r\n\r\n417\r\n00:57:22,966 --> 00:57:32,766\r\nthese so I put them on server 2.  Notice I reuse the image ID.  Image ID 1 up here is a teacher computer on server 1 but on server 2 image ID 1 \r\n\r\n418\r\n00:57:32,766 --> 00:57:43,199\r\nis a high school student computer.  They're both using image ID 1 but because that's between 1 and 4095, the servers will know that those are \r\n\r\n419\r\n00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:55,366\r\ntwo different images.  But lab machines, let's say I've got 10 computer labs with 50 computers each, so 500 lab machines.  If I want to reimage \r\n\r\n420\r\n00:57:55,366 --> 00:58:01,199\r\nall of those lab machines, that's a lot of bandwidth and it's going to overwhelm one server.  So, I decide I want to have the lab \r\n\r\n421\r\n00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:11,433\r\nmachine image on two different servers so I give them an ID of 5000 and I set the that image ID of 5000 on both servers.  Because that's between \r\n\r\n422\r\n00:58:11,433 --> 00:58:22,466\r\n4096 and 65,535, the servers will know that that's actually the same image, the same image just stored on two different servers.  So on my \r\n\r\n423\r\n00:58:22,466 --> 00:58:32,266\r\nclient, when I fire up a client and I get the list of images to download, it'll know not to show that one twice, just to show it once, because it's the \r\n\r\n424\r\n00:58:32,266 --> 00:58:38,899\r\nsame image on two servers.  So the final list they'll see, well, they'll see the teacher computer, the middle school, high school, and \r\n\r\n425\r\n00:58:38,900 --> 00:58:47,566\r\nelementary school computer images, and they'll just see one entry for lab machine.  They won't see double.  That's what that image ID does, \r\n\r\n426\r\n00:58:47,566 --> 00:58:57,966\r\nand it's really just a representation of this checkmark right here.  When it is not checked you get a number 1 through 4095.  When it is \r\n\r\n427\r\n00:58:57,966 --> 00:59:07,899\r\nchecked you get a number between 4096 and 65,535.  The problem is you don't see that number, do you?  So, when you use this way, \r\n\r\n428\r\n00:59:07,900 --> 00:59:14,466\r\nyou don't see the number.  You can't pick it.  So, if you really want to store it on more than one server, you typically will have to do the \r\n\r\n429\r\n00:59:14,466 --> 00:59:25,999\r\ncustomize button and inside of customize you can specify that image ID right there.  And I can come in and I can specify 5000, and now that \r\n\r\n430\r\n00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:33,633\r\nI've specified 5000 as a higher number, I can store this image on more than one server with that number, and it will know that it's the same \r\n\r\n431\r\n00:59:33,633 --> 00:59:43,366\r\nimage.  So, that's what the purpose of that image index ID is, really useful if you're doing load balancing across more than one server.  \r\n\r\n432\r\n00:59:43,366 --> 00:59:51,232\r\nYou know, a lot of these screens inside of the Automator activities, when we go in here you'll see that they really are just reflecting what we \r\n\r\n433\r\n00:59:51,233 --> 00:59:58,733\r\nsaw in the wizard a moment ago.  I can switch from NetBoot to NetRestore.  The install volume, I can't change here.  I'd have to go up here to \r\n\r\n434\r\n00:59:58,733 --> 01:00:05,733\r\nchange that, and you'll see that it switches, so this really is just reflecting exactly what we see in the wizard.  We just get the nitty gritty \r\n\r\n435\r\n01:00:05,733 --> 01:00:12,699\r\ndetails, and so we can go in here and specify this data that we wouldn't normally have in the wizard.  So, that's all this is really doing, is \r\n\r\n436\r\n01:00:12,700 --> 01:00:21,266\r\nrecreating that wizard for us.  So, that's basically it.  When we run through this, we create our images, and we've got them available.  \r\n\r\n437\r\n01:00:21,266 --> 01:00:29,199\r\nFor our next episode, I do want to go ahead and make a direct clone of that hard drive while I've got it here.  So, I'm going to do a NetRestore of \r\n\r\n438\r\n01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:37,333\r\nthat hard drive, and I did this in the last segment, but I customized the option.  I added a Christopher Walken account.  I changed the \r\n\r\n439\r\n01:00:37,333 --> 01:00:43,533\r\nhard drive partitioning and stuff.  So, this time, I want to create another NetRestore image, but I'm not going to mess with any of those settings \r\n\r\n440\r\n01:00:43,533 --> 01:00:58,333\r\nand I'm going to call this my Clone of OSX-Client1.  So I'm just going to go ahead and create that direct clone, and I'll let that one get \r\n\r\n441\r\n01:00:58,333 --> 01:01:06,233\r\ncreated, and since I'm not using the little customize screen, I'll actually get a progress bar on this one.  So, I'll just let that get created \r\n\r\n442\r\n01:01:06,233 --> 01:01:20,466\r\nthere.  Whoops, assuming I can type my password, it will go in and create it, and I will just let that one run and so there it goes.  So, \r\n\r\n443\r\n01:01:20,466 --> 01:01:28,432\r\nonce we've got our  images created, they're just sitting right there on our hard drive wherever it is that we chose to place them, so I placed them \r\n\r\n444\r\n01:01:28,433 --> 01:01:36,266\r\nall right here on this removal drive called Image Storage.  Our next step is once you've got the images what do you do with them?  Well, we \r\n\r\n445\r\n01:01:36,266 --> 01:01:42,932\r\nneed to deploy them out to our clients, and there's a number of ways that we're going to do that and we're going to see them in our next \r\n\r\n446\r\n01:01:42,933 --> 01:01:49,999\r\nepisode.  We will see how to deploy it using like a USB hard drive, which is probably the fastest way.  We'll also see how to deploy it via the \r\n\r\n447\r\n01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:55,433\r\nnetwork, which is probably the easiest way because you don't have to take something and move it from machine to machine.  You can just \r\n\r\n448\r\n01:01:55,433 --> 01:02:03,699\r\ndo it right via the network.  So a lot of cool ways to do that.  We're also going to get our first exposure to the actual Mac OS Server \r\n\r\n449\r\n01:02:03,700 --> 01:02:10,800\r\napplication.  We haven't really used that, yet.  We'll get our first chance to see it in the next show.  So, I am going to let this thing sit here \r\n\r\n450\r\n01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:18,966\r\nand run.  It's making slow but steady progress, so I'll have that ready for our next episode.  But for today's episode, that's pretty much it.  We \r\n\r\n451\r\n01:02:18,966 --> 01:02:26,899\r\ncovered building a NetInstall disk.  We, also, covered doing a NetRestore.  We built the images.  They're sitting there.  We just need to \r\n\r\n452\r\n01:02:26,900 --> 01:02:33,866\r\ndo something with them, and that's what we'll see in our next episode.  So, let me just remind you guys, if you ever have any questions on \r\n\r\n453\r\n01:02:33,866 --> 01:02:41,366\r\nthis, live during the show you can go to ITPro.TV/live.  You'll see our chat room right beneath the video.  Post your questions there.  \r\n\r\n454\r\n01:02:41,366 --> 01:02:48,699\r\nWe monitor and answer during the show.  If you have questions after the show, use our Q&A forms, which, now that I think about it, we need \r\n\r\n455\r\n01:02:48,700 --> 01:02:55,900\r\nto add in our Macintosh forms, but at the top of every page you'll see a link that says Q&A.  Click on that.  It'll take you to the forums.  You \r\n\r\n456\r\n01:02:55,900 --> 01:03:01,266\r\ncan post your questions there.  We monitor and answer.  We want to make sure you guys get the information you need so that you're ready to \r\n\r\n457\r\n01:03:01,266 --> 01:03:10,432\r\ngo and pass that exam on the first try.  That's what we hope for.  So definitely take advantage of that resource.  It is there for you.  Well, I hope \r\n\r\n458\r\n01:03:10,433 --> 01:03:17,233\r\nyou guys enjoyed the show.  Signing off for ITProTV, I'm Don Pezet, and I will see you next time.  \r\n\r\n459\r\n01:03:17,233 --> 01:03:35,099\r\n[Music]  \r\n\r\n",

I'm your host, Don Pezet,  \r\n\r\n3\r\n00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:49,433\r\nback with another episode of Apple Certified \r\nAssociate.  We're going to dive right back into \r\nour Mac Management Basics and really just \r\n\r\n4\r\n00:00:49,433 --> 00:00:58,233\r\nkind of make the logical progression from our \r\nlast episode.  In our last episode, if you tuned \r\nin, we covered how to create images of a  \r\n\r\n5\r\n00:00:58,233 --> 00:01:05,166\r\nMacintosh install.  So, if you want to deploy \r\nMac OS across a bunch of machines in our \r\nnetwork, we can use our install image, if we \r\n\r\n6\r\n00:01:05,166 --> 00:01:12,832\r\nwant, our Mavericks installer, or we can create \r\nour own custom installers that meet our need, \r\nand that 's what we did in the last episode.  We \r\n\r\n7\r\n00:01:12,833 --> 00:01:20,766\r\ncreated several of them, but as you probably \r\nnoticed we created all these images and then \r\nwe didn't do anything with them.  So, the next \r\n\r\n8\r\n00:01:20,766 --> 00:01:27,332\r\nstep is to actually do something with the \r\nimages, and that's what we're going to take a \r\nlook at today in our deployment episode.  Now \r\n\r\n9\r\n00:01:27,333 --> 00:01:34,833\r\nwhen it comes to deploying an image, if you \r\nneed a custom image, great, you can use all the \r\nstuff we used in the last episode, but not \r\n\r\n10\r\n00:01:34,833 --> 00:01:42,199\r\neverybody does.  Not everybody needs a \r\ncustom image.  Some people need to just \r\nreinstall Mavericks on your machine.  Maybe \r\n\r\n11\r\n00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:48,366\r\nsomebody got a laptop, say you gave them a \r\nMacBook Air or something like that, and they've \r\nbeen using it for a few months and they just \r\n\r\n12\r\n00:01:48,366 --> 00:01:57,099\r\njunked it up with a bunch of software and maybe \r\nthey were one of those users who's not like \r\nsomebody who is formally trained but knows \r\n\r\n13\r\n00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:02,633\r\nenough to do damage.  So, they've messed \r\naround with some of the extensions and \r\npreferences in the system and just kind of \r\n\r\n14\r\n00:02:02,633 --> 00:02:10,199\r\njunked things up, and you just want to reset and \r\nstart over from scratch.  Sometimes that's all we \r\nneed, and for that we can just use the regular \r\n\r\n15\r\n00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:17,500\r\nMavericks installer to do it.  We don't have to \r\nbuild custom images just to reset a machine \r\nback to default.  If they have a recovery petition \r\n\r\n16\r\n00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:23,033\r\non the system, you can just use that.  That's \r\nthe easy way, but if they don't even have that or \r\nif they've done something like deleted the \r\n\r\n17\r\n00:02:23,033 --> 00:02:30,899\r\nrecovery partition to make more room, then what \r\ndo we do?  In the old days, when you bought a \r\nMac it came with CDs or DVDs, so you'd open \r\n\r\n18\r\n00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:38,733\r\nup the box and there was a DVD for, you know, \r\nMountain Lion or whatever version of OS X that \r\nmachine came with.  So, you'd grab that DVD \r\n\r\n19\r\n00:02:38,733 --> 00:02:47,233\r\nand you'd boot off of that and redo the install, \r\nbut in newer versions of OS X, you don't get \r\ndisks any more so what do you do? Well, that's \r\n\r\n20\r\n00:02:47,233 --> 00:02:53,466\r\nwhere I want to start today is I want to show you \r\nguys how to make a bootable media of \r\nMavericks so that you can use it for doing clean \r\n\r\n21\r\n00:02:53,466 --> 00:03:01,132\r\ninstalls or updating or refreshing a machine, if \r\nneeded.  And then, we'll take a look at how to \r\ndeploy some of those images we made in the \r\n\r\n22\r\n00:03:01,133 --> 00:03:08,033\r\nlast episode afterwards.  Starting with Mavericks \r\nis one of the easiest ones because with it we \r\ndon't need a server for deployment or anything \r\n\r\n23\r\n00:03:08,033 --> 00:03:16,833\r\nlike that.  We really just need some USB \r\nstorage.  You can turn any thumb drive or USB \r\nhard drive into a bootable installation media for \r\n\r\n24\r\n00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:22,866\r\nMavericks, if you want to.  It's pretty straight \r\nforward.  You know, I say that.  The command is \r\nkind of hard to find, but once you run the \r\n\r\n25\r\n00:03:22,866 --> 00:03:30,166\r\ncommand, the rest of it is really straightforward.  \r\nSo, if we want to see that process we can run \r\nthrough it here on my server.  So, on my little \r\n\r\n26\r\n00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:37,132\r\nserver here, I've got a USB hard drive attached.  \r\nNow, the only thing we really need to be \r\nconcerned with on the hard drive, is that it does \r\n\r\n27\r\n00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:45,866\r\nneed to have enough storage.  You'll typically \r\nneed an 8 GB or bigger.  The Mavericks installer \r\nis about 5.3 GB, so it's a little bit more than \r\n\r\n28\r\n00:03:45,866 --> 00:03:53,232\r\nwhat a 4 GB drive can handle and to my \r\nknowledge they don't make 6's so you pretty \r\nmuch have to go to 8 GB or bigger.  Now, mine \r\n\r\n29\r\n00:03:53,233 --> 00:04:04,233\r\nis considerably bigger than that.  I think it's a \r\nTB.  I don't remember.  Oh, it's 500 GB.  So, I've \r\ngot a 500 GB drive, which is super overkill for \r\n\r\n30\r\n00:04:04,233 --> 00:04:11,566\r\nwhat we need. You could use a USB drive if you \r\nwanted, I mean, like a thumb drive; 8 GB is \r\nplenty.  But, what I'm going to do is I'm going to \r\n\r\n31\r\n00:04:11,566 --> 00:04:20,266\r\ntake this drive and I'm going to turn it into a \r\nbootable Mavericks installer.  Now, when you get \r\nthe disk, if it's already got data on it, it's a good \r\n\r\n32\r\n00:04:20,266 --> 00:04:27,332\r\nidea to format it, you know, get the data off of \r\nthere.  No sense having a bunch of extra junk on \r\nthere, and then we can use our Mavericks \r\n\r\n33\r\n00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:35,033\r\ninstaller to actually turn this into bootable \r\nmedia.  And, there is a little command utility \r\nthat's built into Mavericks that will do this, we \r\n\r\n34\r\n00:04:35,033 --> 00:04:41,833\r\njust don't see it by default.  It is not one that has \r\nan icon.  What we're going to need to do is we \r\nare going to need to dive into the terminal on our \r\n\r\n35\r\n00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:53,966\r\nsystem.  So, I'm going to fire up the terminal, \r\nand the command that I want to run is actually \r\ninside of the Mavericks installer.  So, you know, \r\n\r\n36\r\n00:04:53,966 --> 00:05:05,132\r\nif I browse on my hard drive and I go into my \r\napplications, I've got the install OS X Mavericks \r\nright there, so there's that installer.  Well, when \r\n\r\n37\r\n00:05:05,133 --> 00:05:13,299\r\nwe look at an application like this, that's what is \r\nit is.  It's an application.  We see it as a single \r\nthing like a single file, but in reality these \r\n\r\n38\r\n00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:19,566\r\napplications, they're folders.  They are actually \r\ndirectories.  If I were to double click on this, \r\nthough, it launches the installer.  It doesn't \r\n\r\n39\r\n00:05:19,566 --> 00:05:30,466\r\nbrowse into that directory and that's why I have \r\nto go into my terminal because from the terminal \r\nI actually can browse into that folder, so I'm \r\n\r\n40\r\n00:05:30,466 --> 00:05:36,566\r\ngoing browse into, and I'm just going to use a \r\ncouple of commands here.  If you're not really \r\nfamiliar with the terminal, it's not too bad.  I'm \r\n\r\n41\r\n00:05:36,566 --> 00:05:46,466\r\ngoing to use CD\\applications, and that'll change \r\ninto my applications folder and from there I can \r\nsee all the different applications I've got installed \r\n\r\n42\r\n00:05:46,466 --> 00:05:55,932\r\non my machine by using the LS or list \r\ncommand.  And when I do LS, I see install OS X \r\nMavericks.app.  That's that application that is \r\n\r\n43\r\n00:05:55,933 --> 00:06:03,499\r\nthat installer.  But what we don't really see here \r\nis that that's actually a directory that I can \r\nchange into it and if I don't want to type the \r\n\r\n44\r\n00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:11,033\r\nwhole thing, you can use the tab auto complete \r\nso if you hit tab it'll finish typing for you.  So I'm \r\ngoing to change into that directory and now I'm \r\n\r\n45\r\n00:06:11,033 --> 00:06:24,766\r\nactually inside of the application and inside of \r\nhere, there are a few more directories.  I need to \r\nget into contents and then I need to get into \r\n\r\n46\r\n00:06:24,766 --> 00:06:34,266\r\nresources and it's in that folder that I\"m going to \r\nfind the utility that I need.  So, the full path from \r\nwhere I'm at is \r\n\r\n47\r\n00:06:34,266 --> 00:06:46,066\r\n/applications/installosxmaverics.app/contents/re\r\nsources, and I'll put this with the show notes so \r\ndon't feel like you have to scramble to write that \r\n\r\n48\r\n00:06:46,066 --> 00:06:53,032\r\ndown right now but I'll put that in there.  We \r\nbasically just need to get into that directory and \r\nyou can't do it with the GUI because it will run \r\n\r\n49\r\n00:06:53,033 --> 00:07:01,699\r\nthe installer.  Once you're there, if you use the \r\nlist command, you'll see there is a ton of stuff in \r\nthere.  There's, you know, more than what will fit \r\n\r\n50\r\n00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:10,500\r\non my screen, but the one that I want is a little \r\nscript in here that will create the installer for us.  \r\nIt's create install media.  That's the one that I \r\n\r\n51\r\n00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:18,033\r\nwant and it's actually right here.  I scrolled past \r\nit.  This guy.  Create install media.  It's a little \r\nprogram right here inside of the Mavericks \r\n\r\n52\r\n00:07:18,033 --> 00:07:29,766\r\ninstaller, and if I run that, so I'm just going to run \r\ncreate install media, it's going to run.  Oh, it \r\nsays I need to do this as root, which I am not \r\n\r\n53\r\n00:07:29,766 --> 00:07:36,632\r\nroot.  So when I ran it, I'm running as a regular \r\nuser right now, so it's a little bit mad at me.  It's \r\ntelling me I need to run it as root.  So, I just \r\n\r\n54\r\n00:07:36,633 --> 00:07:47,533\r\nneed to add the word sudo or sudo.  That means \r\nsuperuser do.  I want to do this task as a \r\nsuperuser as root, in this case.  So, I'm going to \r\n\r\n55\r\n00:07:47,533 --> 00:07:55,633\r\njust take that command I ran a minute ago and \r\nstick sudo at the beginning of it and now it's \r\ngoing to run.  It wants to run as an administrator \r\n\r\n56\r\n00:07:55,633 --> 00:08:06,299\r\nso it's asking for my password so I will punch \r\nthat in there and now it's going to give me the \r\nsyntax that I run for the command.  So, you've \r\n\r\n57\r\n00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:15,933\r\ngot create install media and then -- volume and \r\nthe path to the volume that we're going to be \r\nconverting and then -- application path and then \r\n\r\n58\r\n00:08:15,933 --> 00:08:25,333\r\nthe path to get to the install OS X Mavericks \r\napp.  So, we need to feed it that information and \r\nwe'll be able to create the install media.  Now, \r\n\r\n59\r\n00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:31,766\r\nmy install media.  I'm going to stretch this \r\nwindow out.  Actually, you know, I should \r\nprobably bump that font size up.  It is a little bit \r\n\r\n60\r\n00:08:31,766 --> 00:08:50,566\r\nhard to read.  Let me find my font sizes buried in \r\nhere.  Let's go...  There, that's nice and big.  \r\nThat will work perfect.  Okay.  So, if you're not \r\n\r\n61\r\n00:08:50,566 --> 00:08:58,199\r\nsure of what your volume is named, you can use \r\nthe LS command and I'll do ls/volumes and I can \r\nsee my volumes in there.  I want to use my USB \r\n\r\n62\r\n00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:06,366\r\nstorage.  That's the one that I'm going to be \r\nconverting, so the command that I need to run is \r\ngoing to be sudo.-createinstallmedia--\r\n\r\n63\r\n00:09:06,366 --> 00:09:21,899\r\nThat's me calling the program, and then I'll say  \r\n--volume/volumes/usbstorage and I use tab auto \r\ncomplete.  Notice how it did the little back \r\n\r\n64\r\n00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:29,766\r\nslashes before a space.  That's so that it \r\nunderstands that that space is part of the file \r\nnames.  So, be careful if you've got spaces and \r\n\r\n65\r\n00:09:29,766 --> 00:09:39,466\r\nlet me move this so that my head won't cut it off \r\nhere in a second.  There we go.  And then I need \r\nto say --applicationpath and tell it where it can \r\n\r\n66\r\n00:09:39,466 --> 00:09:51,666\r\nfind the installer, which for me is \r\n/applications/installosmavericksapp.  So, I'm \r\nfeeding it this way.  I'm giving it the volume that I \r\n\r\n67\r\n00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:58,799\r\nwant to turn into an installer and the source of \r\nwhere it can get its data, and I'm going to run \r\nthat and it's just warning me here it's going to \r\n\r\n68\r\n00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:04,733\r\nerase that disk.  Remember, I said you probably \r\nwant to get your data off of there.  You don't \r\nwant junk on there that you're going to lose, and \r\n\r\n69\r\n00:10:04,733 --> 00:10:14,633\r\nI'll say yes and off it goes.  It's going to erase \r\nthe disk and then it'll copy the Mavericks \r\nsoftware over to it and when it's done, I'll have a \r\n\r\n70\r\n00:10:14,633 --> 00:10:23,366\r\nbootable USB device, either thumb drive or hard \r\ndrive.  I can hook it up to any computer, boot off \r\nof the USB drive, and install Mavericks.  \r\n\r\n71\r\n00:10:23,366 --> 00:10:30,032\r\nYou know, I say any computerm not any \r\ncomputer.  You can't do it on like a Windows or \r\na regular PC.  It's got to be an be an Apple \r\n\r\n72\r\n00:10:30,033 --> 00:10:36,533\r\nproduct that does support Mavericks.  It's \r\npicking up that new hard drive and asking if I \r\nwant to use it for Time Machine and I'm just \r\n\r\n73\r\n00:10:36,533 --> 00:10:45,633\r\ngoing to say don't use and it's already copying \r\nthe installer files to the disk.  So, I let it run and \r\nwhen it's done, I'll have that installer.  Now if that \r\n\r\n74\r\n00:10:45,633 --> 00:10:53,699\r\nseemed kind of hard, well it is.  It's kind of a lot \r\nto go through, but you don't typically have to do \r\nthis very often.  You know, you create one of \r\n\r\n75\r\n00:10:53,700 --> 00:11:01,233\r\nthese USB drives and then you can use it for \r\nyour machines.  Now if you have to deploy 1000 \r\nmachines, you don't want to make 1000 of these \r\n\r\n76\r\n00:11:01,233 --> 00:11:07,899\r\nUSB drives and don't want to take one drive and \r\nplug it in one machine and wait til it's done and \r\nthen go to the next one and the next one and \r\n\r\n77\r\n00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:16,366\r\nthe next one.  So, this type of solution right \r\nhere, it's really designed for single use, maybe \r\nhome use, a small office, not anything too \r\n\r\n78\r\n00:11:16,366 --> 00:11:24,232\r\nsignificant there, just really basic stuff.  And, if \r\nyou've got a recovery partition on your drive, you \r\nreally shouldn't even need this.  This would be if \r\n\r\n79\r\n00:11:24,233 --> 00:11:32,299\r\nyou had a hard drive fail, and you had to replace \r\nthe hard drive so you would've lost your recovery \r\npartition or if you deleted the recovery partition \r\n\r\n80\r\n00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:38,400\r\nto free up space, that's when you'd really need \r\nthis.  That's why they don't make it so easy.  \r\nThere's not like a little wizard.  There are some \r\n\r\n81\r\n00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:43,300\r\nthird-party software out there.  If you go to \r\nGoogle and do a search, you'll find people who \r\nhave made like graphic user interfaces for doing \r\n\r\n82\r\n00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:50,800\r\nthis process right here, but on the exam, this is \r\nthe one that shows up.  This is the one that \r\ncomes with the system.  So on the exam, you \r\n\r\n83\r\n00:11:50,800 --> 00:12:00,300\r\ncan expect to see the create install media \r\ncommand.  So, I'll let that run.  It does take a \r\nlittle while.  It's copying 5.5 GB to a USB device, \r\n\r\n84\r\n00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:07,966\r\nand unfortunately, I've got my virtual machines \r\nand stuff that I use here for the labs are all \r\nrunning off a Thunderbolt drive, which is really \r\n\r\n85\r\n00:12:07,966 --> 00:12:16,766\r\nfast, but that USB drive that I plugged in is only \r\nUSB 2.0 and USB 2.0 is not terribly fast.  So \r\nthat 5.5 GB, it'll take a little while to copy over to \r\n\r\n86\r\n00:12:16,766 --> 00:12:25,299\r\nit, but when it's done, that drive is ready to go.  \r\nIt's ready to rock.  You can boot a system and \r\nyour in business.  Now, while we're waiting on \r\n\r\n87\r\n00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:35,133\r\nthat, we can do the same thing, except instead \r\nof using the Mavericks installer, we can use \r\nsome of the images that we made in the last \r\n\r\n88\r\n00:12:35,133 --> 00:12:45,899\r\nepisode.  Remember the NetInstall and the \r\nNetRestore images that we made?  We can turn \r\nthose into bootable media, and then when you \r\n\r\n89\r\n00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:54,633\r\nboot off of that drive, instead of doing a straight, \r\nclean Mavericks install like we would get with \r\nthis drive, we would get a restored image that \r\n\r\n90\r\n00:12:54,633 --> 00:13:00,799\r\nwe took yesterday that would already have the \r\nsoftware and features that we wanted.  So, \r\nthat's pretty cool and it does allow us do some \r\n\r\n91\r\n00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:08,733\r\ngood customizations.  It's actually easier to \r\nbuild one of those install disks then it was to do \r\nwhat I just did here.  I had to drop to the \r\n\r\n92\r\n00:13:08,733 --> 00:13:15,166\r\ncommand line.  I had to go into terminal and I \r\nhad to run this crazy command in this crazy \r\npath to be able to create this Mavericks installer.  \r\n\r\n93\r\n00:13:15,166 --> 00:13:23,399\r\nIf I want to turn one of my NetInstall or \r\nNetRestore images into a bootable disk, it's a \r\ngood bit easier.  So, I'm going to show you that \r\n\r\n94\r\n00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:30,066\r\nhere in a moment.  In fact, in real life land, when \r\nI want to make a Mavericks installer, I don't \r\nnormally go this way.  I normally go the \r\n\r\n95\r\n00:13:30,066 --> 00:13:38,866\r\nNetInstall route and convert that, if I need it.  So, \r\nwe'll see that is a little bit easier.  Now, that it's \r\ndone, though, it finished up so now that USB \r\n\r\n96\r\n00:13:38,866 --> 00:13:50,399\r\ndrive is a bootable Mavericks installer.  If I take a \r\nlook, my USB drive has renamed itself to install \r\nOS X Mavericks, and if I browse into it there's \r\n\r\n97\r\n00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:57,333\r\nthat installer.  Now, you might say to yourself, \r\n\"Wait a minute, Don, couldn't we have just \r\ncopied that installer to the drive.\"  You could \r\n\r\n98\r\n00:13:57,333 --> 00:14:06,599\r\nhave, but the drive wouldn't be bootable, at that \r\npoint.  There's a process that's called blessing \r\nthe drive.  A blessed drive is one that's marked \r\n\r\n99\r\n00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:14,300\r\nas bootable that's got a boot sector on it so \r\nyou're able to boot up from it.  A USB drive or \r\neven your internal hard drives, like this image \r\n\r\n100\r\n00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:20,633\r\nstorage that I've got right here, those drives are \r\nnot blessed by default and so they're not able to \r\nbe booted from.  So, if I just copied the \r\n\r\n101\r\n00:14:20,633 --> 00:14:27,199\r\nMavericks installer to it, I wouldn't be able to \r\nboot from that drive.  Sure, I could take it to a \r\nmachine that was already running Mac OS and I \r\n\r\n102\r\n00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:33,800\r\ncould launch that installer and go from there, but \r\nif I had a machine that was damaged that \r\ncouldn't boot that had a blank hard drive, I \r\n\r\n103\r\n00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:43,600\r\nwouldn't be able to boot from it.  So, when I ran \r\nthat from the terminal, as a part of getting that \r\nsystem ready it did this right here, making disk \r\n\r\n104\r\n00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:52,033\r\nbootable.  That what it shows up as here.  The \r\nterminology you are likely to see on the exam is \r\nblessing the drive.  So a blessed drive is a drive \r\n\r\n105\r\n00:14:52,033 --> 00:15:01,799\r\nthat's bootable.  So, that's the special thing that \r\nit's doing.  It's copying that data.  It's getting it \r\nready, making it ready to be booted, and if I take \r\n\r\n106\r\n00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:16,800\r\na look inside of like disk util, I want to say that \r\nthat hard drive was formatted exFAT before the \r\nshow and after it got done with it, it should \r\n\r\n107\r\n00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:27,633\r\nbe formatted as the Mac system.  So, yeah, I \r\ncan see it's Mac OS Extended Journaled format.  \r\nSo, it did format it, got it clean and ready \r\n\r\n108\r\n00:15:27,633 --> 00:15:42,199\r\nto go, and now it's a Mavericks installer.  So, \r\nwhat if I wanted to turn one of my NetInstalls \r\ninto a bootable media like this.  Well we can, \r\n\r\n109\r\n00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:49,700\r\nand there are a couple of ways to go about it.  \r\nIt's really not that bad, at all, if we want to do it.  \r\nWhat we do, is first go ahead and format the \r\n\r\n110\r\n00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:57,333\r\ndrive, if it hasn't been formatted already.  Now, \r\nwe just prepared this one, so it's ready to go but \r\nit's got that Mavericks installer.  I want to set it \r\n\r\n111\r\n00:15:57,333 --> 00:16:04,899\r\nup for my NetInstall.  So, I'm going to need to \r\nformat that again and get it kind of cleaned up \r\nso it doesn't have that installer on there.  So, I'm \r\n\r\n112\r\n00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:19,133\r\ngoing to go back into my disk utility, and I'll just \r\nformat that drive real quick.  And so, I'm just \r\ngoing to give it a generic name, and whoops, \r\n\r\n113\r\n00:16:19,133 --> 00:16:27,966\r\nthat's not what I wanted.  It's apparently going to \r\nlook that up on the internet.  [Laughter]  Let me \r\nget out of Safari real quick.  I got a little click \r\n\r\n114\r\n00:16:27,966 --> 00:16:36,366\r\nhappy on that one.  So, I'm just going to format \r\nthat drive real quick and I'll just call USB storage \r\nagain so that it will all just be back to the way \r\n\r\n115\r\n00:16:36,366 --> 00:16:44,432\r\nthat it was.  Now, when I format it, it's not going \r\nto be blessed any more, so it's no longer going \r\nto be a bootable drive.  It's just a regular USB \r\n\r\n116\r\n00:16:44,433 --> 00:16:59,699\r\ndrive, again, that's ready to store some stuff, \r\neventually.  There we go.  Okay.  So, this drive \r\nis just a regular USB drive with nothing on it.  I \r\n\r\n117\r\n00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:10,333\r\ncan take any of my NetInstall or NetRestore \r\nimages and I can copy them to this drive and \r\nthen all I have to do is bless that folder and then \r\n\r\n118\r\n00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:17,433\r\nthe drive will be able to the boot.  So, we kind of \r\nhave the kind of manually do that process that \r\nscript a moment ago did for us.  So, I'll take one \r\n\r\n119\r\n00:17:17,433 --> 00:17:27,866\r\nof my images from last episode, let me take my, \r\nwe'll do our NetInstall.  So, here's that network \r\ninstall we made of Mavericks, and I'm just going \r\n\r\n120\r\n00:17:27,866 --> 00:17:36,766\r\nto copy it over.  So, we'll let that copy over.  So, \r\nno running scripts or anything like that.  I'm just \r\ngoing to copy that file over, and then when it's \r\n\r\n121\r\n00:17:36,766 --> 00:17:47,266\r\ndone, I can use Automator to go ahead and flag \r\nthis as a blessed drive.  And once that's done, \r\nwe'll be able to boot and boot right off of that \r\n\r\n122\r\n00:17:47,266 --> 00:17:53,399\r\nMavericks NetInstall that we made.  Is that \r\neasier than running that script I showed you a \r\nmoment ago?   Absolutely, and that's why I was \r\n\r\n123\r\n00:17:53,400 --> 00:18:01,633\r\nsaying in real life land this is how I normally do \r\nit.  I normally have a NetInstall of Mavericks or \r\nwhatever version of OS X we're on that month.  \r\n\r\n124\r\n00:18:01,633 --> 00:18:09,833\r\nI'll normally have one of those somewhere on the \r\nnetwork, and if I've got one of those already in \r\nplace, I can just drag that .nbi folder, just drag it \r\n\r\n125\r\n00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:19,133\r\nright over and then from there we can just bless \r\nit and you've got a bootable media.  So, it's \r\ncopying over.  I do have to wait for it to finish \r\n\r\n126\r\n00:18:19,133 --> 00:18:27,533\r\nbefore I bless it.  If you do it ahead of time, you \r\ncan cause some problems, but I guess I can \r\nactually start some of the process right now.  I'm \r\n\r\n127\r\n00:18:27,533 --> 00:18:40,699\r\ngoing to fire up the Automator and in the \r\nAutomator you've got a ton of different options in \r\nthere as far as what you want to do to change \r\n\r\n128\r\n00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:48,866\r\nbehavior on your system and what we want to \r\ndo is we want to create a workflow that is going \r\nto perform an action on that drive, so I'm just \r\n\r\n129\r\n00:18:48,866 --> 00:18:55,866\r\ngoing to choose the default here, which a \r\nworkflow and I'll have a nice blank workflow.  And \r\nwhat I'm going to do is I'm going to tell it to get \r\n\r\n130\r\n00:18:55,866 --> 00:19:02,699\r\nthat drive, get that folder that I just copied and \r\nbless it.  And when we run that, it will be a \r\nblessed drive, and then we'll be able to boot off \r\n\r\n131\r\n00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:12,266\r\nof that one to do an install, also.  So, let me, let \r\nme see how my copy is doing back there.  So, \r\nwe'll give that just a moment while it finishes and \r\n\r\n132\r\n00:19:12,266 --> 00:19:17,466\r\nthen we'll be ready to rock.  While I'm waiting on \r\nthat, let me show you the options that I'm going \r\nto use.  There are a lot of options in the \r\n\r\n133\r\n00:19:17,466 --> 00:19:26,199\r\nAutomator.  You can do a ton of stuff with it, but \r\nthere are really just two things that I need.  One, \r\nI need to get the files that I want to bless, and \r\n\r\n134\r\n00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:36,433\r\nthen two, I need to bless the drive.  So, one that \r\nI'm going to look for is under here under files and \r\nfolders.  You'll see get specified finder items.  \r\n\r\n135\r\n00:19:36,433 --> 00:19:44,533\r\nThat's going to let me tell it what it is that I want \r\nto bless.  So, that's going to be step one and \r\nthen step two is under system.  You'll see an \r\n\r\n136\r\n00:19:44,533 --> 00:19:52,633\r\nentry right here.  Bless NetBoot image folder.  \r\nNetBoot image, that's .nbi.  That's that .nbi \r\nfolder that I'm copying right now.  So, we can \r\n\r\n137\r\n00:19:52,633 --> 00:20:00,066\r\nbless it so that it will become a bootable \r\ninstaller.  That's the secret sauce.  That's that \r\nmissing piece that we need to make it where it \r\n\r\n138\r\n00:20:00,066 --> 00:20:10,266\r\nwill be able to boot off of this.  Good, it just \r\nfinished, so I'm going to go to files and folders \r\nand get specified finder items and I'll just drag it \r\n\r\n139\r\n00:20:10,266 --> 00:20:19,099\r\nand drop it over there and I'm going to add in \r\nthat folder, not the original folder, the one I \r\ncopied to the USB.  So, I'll go to USB Storage, \r\n\r\n140\r\n00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:26,800\r\nI'll choose that Network Install, right there, \r\nNetwork Install of OSX.nbi.  I could've grabbed \r\neither of the other ones, right, that Clone of \r\n\r\n141\r\n00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:35,500\r\nOSX-Client1 or whatever.  So, I'll just choose \r\nthat one and hit add.  So, it's got it right there, \r\nand then I'll go over to system and I'll find \r\n\r\n142\r\n00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:45,333\r\nBlessed NetBoot Image folder and I'll drag that \r\non over, and we can give it that custom label and \r\nit's basically going to take this folder and bless \r\n\r\n143\r\n00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:56,399\r\nit.  So, we give it a label.  It's what the end user \r\nwould see if they boot it off of this, so we'll say \r\nsomething like Install OSX Mavericks or OS10 \r\n\r\n144\r\n00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:02,800\r\nMavericks, however you want to say that.  So, \r\nwe'll go ahead and specify it, and that's \r\nbasically all we need to get that ready.  And now \r\n\r\n145\r\n00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:14,800\r\nI can just run it.  There it goes running.  It needs \r\nto be in admin and it's going to bless that folder.  \r\nIt's doing the same thing that we did from that \r\n\r\n146\r\n00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:22,966\r\nscript a few minutes ago.  But did I have to go to \r\nthe terminal shell here?  No.  I was able to do it \r\nall through the GUI.  It's considerably easier this \r\n\r\n147\r\n00:21:22,966 --> 00:21:29,599\r\nway.  You can see this method on the exam, \r\nalso, but I wanted to show you the command \r\nline way because that one can show up on the \r\n\r\n148\r\n00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:39,366\r\nexam, too.  So, be prepared for either method, \r\neven though in real life you may never use either \r\nof these.  It is a rare, rare day that I install Mac \r\n\r\n149\r\n00:21:39,366 --> 00:21:48,332\r\nOS from a USB drive.  I almost always prefer to \r\nuse the network because if you've got one \r\nmachine, sure USB is great, but if you've got \r\n\r\n150\r\n00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:57,099\r\n1000 machines, USB is not even an option.  So, \r\nin a business environment, these two methods \r\nthat I just showed you are not terribly common.  \r\n\r\n151\r\n00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:03,433\r\nNow, the other nice thing about doing this \r\nmethod here, I could have added in \r\ncustomizations.  All of those customizations we \r\n\r\n152\r\n00:22:03,433 --> 00:22:10,566\r\ntalked about yesterday?  I could have added \r\nthem in here to make things a little more \r\nnoninteractive, so the end user doesn't have to \r\n\r\n153\r\n00:22:10,566 --> 00:22:17,032\r\ndeal with it.  They call it a light touch installation \r\nwhere we really don't have to touch much when \r\nthe install happens.  So, we could've done that \r\n\r\n154\r\n00:22:17,033 --> 00:22:24,199\r\nbut here I just did basically the same as what \r\nthat script did.  I copied the installer and I \r\nblessed the drive.  So, now, I'm not going to \r\n\r\n155\r\n00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:33,000\r\nsave that.  So, now, this USB drive has that \r\nnetwork install that we made and it's been \r\nblessed.  I could go and boot a system off of \r\n\r\n156\r\n00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:41,066\r\nthis, and when the system booted off of this \r\nUSB drive, it would see the Mavericks installer \r\nand we'd go through that install process and get \r\n\r\n157\r\n00:22:41,066 --> 00:22:48,799\r\nour system set.  If I'd chosen one of the clones \r\nthat we made or, you know, one of the \r\nNetRestore images then instead of seeing the \r\n\r\n158\r\n00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:56,166\r\ntrue Mavericks installer it would just see the \r\nrestore screen, and it would restore that image \r\nand now they'd be back up and running with the \r\n\r\n159\r\n00:22:56,166 --> 00:23:05,932\r\nconfiguration that we had put in that image.  So, \r\nreally cool stuff there and can be done from \r\nUSB.  Now, the USB side of things, that's great.  \r\n\r\n160\r\n00:23:05,933 --> 00:23:11,466\r\nIt's not that hard to get it going.  Once you've got \r\nit in place you're in business.  You take this \r\ndrive off and you go somewhere and you boot \r\n\r\n161\r\n00:23:11,466 --> 00:23:19,932\r\nfrom it, but the network side, that's where the real action is.  That's where if you've got a large environment you're really going to excel. So, I \r\n\r\n162\r\n00:23:19,933 --> 00:23:27,266\r\nwant to take a look at that next and we'll whip up a NetInstall server and we'll deploy some images to a client using that so that will be our \r\n\r\n163\r\n00:23:27,266 --> 00:23:34,366\r\nchance to see i but as far as USB, I think that's pretty much all we need to know.  So, this is a pretty good spot for us to stop here and take a \r\n\r\n164\r\n00:23:34,366 --> 00:23:40,966\r\nbreak.  Let's pause here, and when we get back, we'll get to see doing the network install.  \r\n\r\n165\r\n00:23:40,966 --> 00:23:49,499\r\n[Music]  \r\n\r\n166\r\n00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:55,800\r\nAll right, welcome back, everybody.  There is one thing I forgot to mention in the first segment I thought of during the break.  I just want to bring \r\n\r\n167\r\n00:23:55,800 --> 00:24:06,533\r\nit up here.  When I copied that NetBoot install image, the .nbi image, I just threw it right on the USB drive.  I threw it in the root of the USB \r\n\r\n168\r\n00:24:06,533 --> 00:24:14,566\r\ndrive, and that's important.  It does have to be in the root of the drive.  In order for us to boot from it, it's got to be right there.  You can't put it in a \r\n\r\n169\r\n00:24:14,566 --> 00:24:22,666\r\nsub folder or nested folder or whatever.  It's got to be in the root, and the reason I mention that is even in episode one, I was continually placing \r\n\r\n170\r\n00:24:22,666 --> 00:24:34,332\r\nthose images in the root.  When we start to set up the NetInstall server here in this segment, I am going to move those images out of the root.  \r\n\r\n171\r\n00:24:34,333 --> 00:24:41,766\r\nI'm going to move them to a different location, and when we do that, we will no longer be able to boot off of them via USB or whatever other \r\n\r\n172\r\n00:24:41,766 --> 00:24:48,566\r\nmethods we might have.  So, just be aware of that.  If you're building USB installers, like I just did in the first segment, they do need to go in \r\n\r\n173\r\n00:24:48,566 --> 00:24:56,466\r\nthe root.  Now, NetInstall, the whole point of NetInstall is that we don't have USB, that we don't have some physical device we go and \r\n\r\n174\r\n00:24:56,466 --> 00:25:06,666\r\nattach to machines.  Instead, the machines boot up off of the network.  They reach out across their Ethernet connection and connect to a \r\n\r\n175\r\n00:25:06,666 --> 00:25:15,866\r\nserver and download their image that way.  Now, I say Ethernet.  You can do it over wireless on some systems, but Apple doesn't support it and \r\n\r\n176\r\n00:25:15,866 --> 00:25:22,432\r\nthey don't recommend it.  Wireless has some various issues when it comes to downloading large quantities but also doing discovery on  \r\n\r\n177\r\n00:25:22,433 --> 00:25:29,766\r\nnetworks so it's not a good idea so Apple doesn't support it.  On the exam, just pretend like wireless doesn't exist.  When you go to do \r\n\r\n178\r\n00:25:29,766 --> 00:25:38,366\r\na deployment, it'll be over Ethernet.  Pretty much every Mac these days either has an Ethernet jack on it or comes with a Thunderbolt \r\n\r\n179\r\n00:25:38,366 --> 00:25:45,899\r\nto Ethernet adapter.  Like, that's how mine is.  It's got the little adapter.  I'm actually using it right now.  And so, you can get that jack.  You \r\n\r\n180\r\n00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:52,933\r\ncan boot your system up.  It reaches out over the network, grabs that installer, and installs onto your system.  Now, to do that, you need \r\n\r\n181\r\n00:25:52,933 --> 00:26:02,433\r\ntwo pieces.  One, you need a client.  You need a client that is NetInstall aware and that supports Mavericks, right, so not every piece of \r\n\r\n182\r\n00:26:02,433 --> 00:26:07,799\r\nApple hardware supports Mavericks.  Some of the older stuff has been trimmed off, but the newer devices, the ones made in the last few \r\n\r\n183\r\n00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:15,933\r\nyears all do, and they also need to have their this system up to date.  They need to be updated, their firmware, at least, so that they'll \r\n\r\n184\r\n00:26:15,933 --> 00:26:24,133\r\nbe able to reach out and find that net install server.  Most of your systems will be just fine, so you should be okay there.  Then, when we \r\n\r\n185\r\n00:26:24,133 --> 00:26:30,966\r\nboot, there are a few different ways we can go about this.  You can boot up holding the N key on your keyboard, and it'll try and boot from the \r\n\r\n186\r\n00:26:30,966 --> 00:26:39,532\r\nnetwork or you can use the startup disk option to tell it to startup from the network.  There is that option, too.  If your system is operational, \r\n\r\n187\r\n00:26:39,533 --> 00:26:47,233\r\nthe startup disk method is the easiest way.  But if your system is damaged, if you just replaced the hard drive and so there's no operating \r\n\r\n188\r\n00:26:47,233 --> 00:26:54,666\r\nsystem on it whatsoever, you can't really get to that startup disk option.  Well, you could if you still had your installer disk or a USB drive that \r\n\r\n189\r\n00:26:54,666 --> 00:27:00,866\r\nyou boot off of and then you boot that way and tell it to use the start up disk of the network.  You can go that route, or you can just hold that \r\n\r\n190\r\n00:27:00,866 --> 00:27:07,366\r\nN key on your keyboard when you boot and it'll try and boot from the network that way, too.  So, a couple of different options there for how you \r\n\r\n191\r\n00:27:07,366 --> 00:27:13,766\r\ncan boot from the network.  Now when you boot from the network, your system is going to look out and say hey I need a NetInstall server; \r\n\r\n192\r\n00:27:13,766 --> 00:27:24,299\r\nsomebody out there help me.  Well, we need to set up a net install server, and fortunately, it's not very hard.  Step one, you need to go into the \r\n\r\n193\r\n00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:38,500\r\napps store and you need to buy the Mac OS 10 or OS X server app.  When we go into the app store, you can search for OS X server, and you'll \r\n\r\n194\r\n00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:46,333\r\nfind it right there.  I've already purchased it, but it's $20 or $19.99 or something like that so it's not going to break the bank and it's pretty small \r\n\r\n195\r\n00:27:46,333 --> 00:27:56,033\r\nat just under 200 MG in size.  So, you can buy it, install it, and now you've got a server, just like that.  That's what turns a client into a server is \r\n\r\n196\r\n00:27:56,033 --> 00:28:05,799\r\ninstalling this one app.  Once it's installed, we can fire it up, and I'm already using it for a few other things.  When you fire it up for the first \r\n\r\n197\r\n00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:15,933\r\ntime, it is going to ask you what to connect to and I want to connect to this Mac.  And, yeah, I've got to provide it my credentials and \r\n\r\n198\r\n00:28:15,933 --> 00:28:21,799\r\napparently I've told it to save it before so excellent security practices there.  But, we're going to connect up to this server and once \r\n\r\n199\r\n00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:28,333\r\nwe're connected we'll see all our different services.  Now, if you just installed the app, all these services are going to be turned off.  The \r\n\r\n200\r\n00:28:28,333 --> 00:28:37,066\r\nserver app isn't actually going to be doing anything.  So, we need to go in and just turn on the different things that we want to use, and so, \r\n\r\n201\r\n00:28:37,066 --> 00:28:43,832\r\nyou'll see your various services right here that you can pick and choose.  You can turn things on and off as you need them.  I'm running the \r\n\r\n202\r\n00:28:43,833 --> 00:28:52,433\r\nwebsites service right now and that's about it.  But down at the very bottom, you'll see the advanced stuff, and the advanced stuff, that's the \r\n\r\n203\r\n00:28:52,433 --> 00:28:59,499\r\ncool stuff.  You'll see DHCP, DNS, open directory, those are the ones that I'm running that I set up prior to the show.  You don't need \r\n\r\n204\r\n00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:07,500\r\nany of those for the NetInstall to work.  In fact, you don't really need any of these except for this one right here, NetInstall, so you can turn off \r\n\r\n205\r\n00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:16,833\r\nevery single feature except NetInstall.  That's the only one we need.  So, I'm going to choose that NetInstall option, and I can see that it's offline \r\n\r\n206\r\n00:29:16,833 --> 00:29:24,966\r\nand it's currently off.  Now, if I just run in here and try to turn it on, it's going to fail, at least it should.  There we go.  It's going to fail and it's \r\n\r\n207\r\n00:29:24,966 --> 00:29:33,666\r\ngoing to tell me to start NetInstall you must have at least one image available to access my clients.  Well, I've got images.  I made a bunch \r\n\r\n208\r\n00:29:33,666 --> 00:29:42,932\r\nof them.  They're all sitting right here in image storage.  The problem is, they're not in the exact right location.  They need to be in a very \r\n\r\n209\r\n00:29:42,933 --> 00:29:50,533\r\nparticular path.  It's expecting to find them in a certain location in a set of folders and I haven't created that.  So, for NetInstall to work I'm going \r\n\r\n210\r\n00:29:50,533 --> 00:29:57,966\r\nto have to move these images out of the root of my drive into a different location.  Now, if you have it memorized, you can go and create those \r\n\r\n211\r\n00:29:57,966 --> 00:30:04,566\r\nfolders, and you'll be in business.  I never do, so I always let the system create them for me.  There are some easy little steps here we can do \r\n\r\n212\r\n00:30:04,566 --> 00:30:12,132\r\nto get this set up where it will create the folders for us.  When I set up a NetInstall, here is the process I run through.  First off, notice it says \r\n\r\n213\r\n00:30:12,133 --> 00:30:20,599\r\nenable  net install on, and then it just says Ethernet.  If you have more than one network adapter, you need to hit edit and pick the \r\n\r\n214\r\n00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:27,333\r\nadapters you want to enable.  So, if you've got two adapters, you may just want it on one and not the other so you pick and choose but you \r\n\r\n215\r\n00:30:27,333 --> 00:30:35,599\r\nneed to pick at least one adapter.  If it doesn't have a network connection it is not going to get you very far.  The next thing that I do is I go \r\n\r\n216\r\n00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:44,400\r\ndown here to edit storage settings.  When you choose edit storage settings, you'll see all the drives attached to your system, and under \r\n\r\n217\r\n00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:52,766\r\nstored data they're all set to none.  That means we don't have any data stored on them.  That's why it can't find the images.  So, if I go to my \r\n\r\n218\r\n00:30:52,766 --> 00:31:01,966\r\ndrives, if it is my internal drive, this Macintosh HD, I can change that and tell it that it is storing images or client data or both images and client \r\n\r\n219\r\n00:31:01,966 --> 00:31:10,966\r\ndata.  Now, images, those are the images that we made in episode one.  Client data, that's talking about profiles and policies, which we \r\n\r\n220\r\n00:31:10,966 --> 00:31:17,732\r\nhaven't done, yet.  We're going to do those in episode five, I think.  In one of the later episodes, we will tackle those.  So, we just \r\n\r\n221\r\n00:31:17,733 --> 00:31:24,566\r\nneed to tell it what it's got, images or images and client data and so on.  Well, I actually don't have any images on Macintosh HD.  I put all of \r\n\r\n222\r\n00:31:24,566 --> 00:31:34,866\r\nmine on image storage.  So, I'm going to tell it that I've got images and client data right there on image storage.  I'm not using that USB drive so \r\n\r\n223\r\n00:31:34,866 --> 00:31:46,499\r\nI'll ignore it, and then see the message here, images should be placed in /library/netboot/netbootsp0 and client data \r\n\r\n224\r\n00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:54,966\r\nshould be in /library/netboot/netbootclients0.  If you had those folders memorized, you could've created them ahead of time and moved the \r\n\r\n225\r\n00:31:54,966 --> 00:32:02,932\r\nimages there.  If you did that, when you hit OK all your images would magically show up.  But, I didn't do that because I don't have the folders \r\n\r\n226\r\n00:32:02,933 --> 00:32:12,666\r\nmemorized.  So, when you set that option, when you set hey, there's going to be images and clients here, it went and created the folders for \r\n\r\n227\r\n00:32:12,666 --> 00:32:21,599\r\nyou.  So, if I browse my image storage drive, see how it created the library folder right there?  And, if I browse into library, there's NetBoot and \r\n\r\n228\r\n00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:34,700\r\nin their is netbootclient0 and netbootsp0, so it's created the folders for me.  So, all I need to do is go and take my images and where it's going \r\n\r\n229\r\n00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:44,433\r\nto send them in there.  So, I'm just going to drag and navigate into there and drop them into that netbootsp0 where it wants them.  And, it's going \r\n\r\n230\r\n00:32:44,433 --> 00:32:54,299\r\nto make me authenticate again.  There we go, and now they're in there.  Now, if you're a patient person, eventually the images will magically \r\n\r\n231\r\n00:32:54,300 --> 00:33:03,666\r\nshow up in here.  If you're impatient, you can hit command R to do a refresh and now they show up.  So, now I can see there's my clone of that \r\n\r\n232\r\n00:33:03,666 --> 00:33:12,332\r\nclient that I did, there's a NetRestore of the client, and there's a straight up network install of OS X Mavericks.  So, there are the three images \r\n\r\n233\r\n00:33:12,333 --> 00:33:21,099\r\nthat we made.  Now, technically, we're done.  See, if even turned the server on for me.  It turned on NetInstall.  I'm done.  It's up and \r\n\r\n234\r\n00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:27,066\r\nrunning.  We could stop here, but there are some other things that we'll probably want to tweak to get the server working exactly how we \r\n\r\n235\r\n00:33:27,066 --> 00:33:35,399\r\nwant.  I used this edit storage settings button a minute ago and that was where we defined our storage repository, where the images are but \r\n\r\n236\r\n00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:45,333\r\nthere's also this little gear button beside it and if you hit that, you'll see edit image settings and use as default boot image.  When somebody \r\n\r\n237\r\n00:33:45,333 --> 00:33:53,533\r\nboots a system and let's say it's an operational system.  They can get in OS X and they can go into the startup disk option.  When they go in \r\n\r\n238\r\n00:33:53,533 --> 00:34:01,833\r\nthe startup disk option, they will see all three of these images.  So they can see all three of them and they can pick which one they want, \r\n\r\n239\r\n00:34:01,833 --> 00:34:09,266\r\nbut if they have a blank hard drive and they're just booting off of their network adapter, they don't have the stuff on their system to show a \r\n\r\n240\r\n00:34:09,266 --> 00:34:15,766\r\ngraphical user interface to show the different options.  So, we may want to flag one of these as the default, to say, hey, if somebody boots \r\n\r\n241\r\n00:34:15,766 --> 00:34:25,532\r\nup and they just can't even render a GUI, they need to connect to one of these and start that process.  And so I normally do my network \r\n\r\n242\r\n00:34:25,533 --> 00:34:31,633\r\ninstall, this one right here.  If they don't have anything on their hard drive, let's start just by getting the Mavericks, just by getting them the \r\n\r\n243\r\n00:34:31,633 --> 00:34:39,766\r\nbase OS.  So, you can use this gear down here to say use as default boot image and then a little note will appear.  Actually, it's over here.  \r\n\r\n244\r\n00:34:39,766 --> 00:34:46,266\r\nSo, I see default.  That's now my default boot image.  So, if somebody boots and they're not using that startup disk option then this is the \r\n\r\n245\r\n00:34:46,266 --> 00:34:54,532\r\none that they're going to go to.  And you can pick whichever one you want and you can change it whenever you want.  Once that's set, \r\n\r\n246\r\n00:34:54,533 --> 00:35:02,233\r\nanother option that I had under there was edit image settings, and if you edit the image settings, it'll come in here and show you just a \r\n\r\n247\r\n00:35:02,233 --> 00:35:11,999\r\nfew other things that you might want to tweak.  For example, we've got make available over.  The default is that it is going to use http, hypertext \r\n\r\n248\r\n00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:21,000\r\ntransfer protocol, to transmit the image between the server and the client.  That's the default, and that's what most people want.  But you can \r\n\r\n249\r\n00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:29,133\r\nchoose to use NFS if you want, the network file system that's a UNIX file transfer protocol.  It's been around a long time.  You can use that if \r\n\r\n250\r\n00:35:29,133 --> 00:35:36,833\r\nyou want.  If your system, for whatever reason does not allow http or whatever, then you can go that route.  So, you've got a few choices there.  \r\n\r\n251\r\n00:35:36,833 --> 00:35:47,666\r\nHttp is what most of us want.  We can also restrict what devices are able to see this image.  I'm installing Mavericks.  Not all hardware \r\n\r\n252\r\n00:35:47,666 --> 00:35:56,099\r\nsupports Mavericks, so I might want to come in here and say only specific Mac models and then I can go through and pick the models that I \r\n\r\n253\r\n00:35:56,100 --> 00:36:03,100\r\nwant, limiting it to, say, you know, only these particular models will see this image so it's a quick way to filter it out.  We saw the same \r\n\r\n254\r\n00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:10,300\r\noption with the Automator earlier in episode one.  When we built an image, we could use Automator to add this filter.  It's doing the same \r\n\r\n255\r\n00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:17,966\r\nexact thing.  These two are doing the same, so we can add that filter after the fact without rebuilding our image.  I will just put it back to all \r\n\r\n256\r\n00:36:17,966 --> 00:36:25,999\r\nMac models for now.  You can also restrict access to the image and so I just hit the little checkmark right there, restrict access, and \r\n\r\n257\r\n00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:34,000\r\nwhen you do that, it brings up the edit screen and you can edit by MAC address.  Now, that's MAC as in media access control, not Mac as in \r\n\r\n258\r\n00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:42,166\r\nMacintosh.  Every physical network adapter has a MAC address and if you look at them, I don't want to unplug mine but if I look at mine, written \r\n\r\n259\r\n00:36:42,166 --> 00:36:48,732\r\non it in little gray on white writing that's almost impossible to read, is a MAC address or if you go into your network preferences, they're in \r\n\r\n260\r\n00:36:48,733 --> 00:36:57,633\r\nthere.  So if I go into my system preferences and network, I can find my MAC address in there, also, so, you know, a few different ways \r\n\r\n261\r\n00:36:57,633 --> 00:37:06,499\r\nto find that.  But you can come in and limit that so that people only see the image if their MAC address has been approved.  You might have an \r\n\r\n262\r\n00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:13,600\r\nimage that you're doing testing with or whatever, so right here, there's my MAC address for my adapter.  So, if I have an image that I'm testing \r\n\r\n263\r\n00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:20,766\r\nwith, I might limit it just to my MAC address so that only I see it and the other people on my network don't see it, yet, so you can kind of \r\n\r\n264\r\n00:37:20,766 --> 00:37:32,532\r\ntweak that if you choose.  So, I'm not going to limit mine for now.  The other thing, you'll see the image index number.  We saw that, too, \r\n\r\n265\r\n00:37:32,533 --> 00:37:40,899\r\nwhen we were using Automator and building our images, and remember what I said, 1 through 4095, that's an image that's just stored on this \r\n\r\n266\r\n00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:51,566\r\nserver alone, 4096 through 65,535, that's an image that's stored on more than one server.  If I change my mind later on and decide to copy \r\n\r\n267\r\n00:37:51,566 --> 00:37:57,632\r\nthis image to more than one server, I can come in here and edit the index and I can change it and move that number to something more \r\n\r\n268\r\n00:37:57,633 --> 00:38:10,699\r\nappropriate.  Now, all of these settings right here are set on each individual image, so this is all on that network install of OS 10.  If I take client1 \r\n\r\n269\r\n00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:17,300\r\nand I go into its image settings, I get the same options and I can pick and choose appropriate for that one, so you could have some going \r\n\r\n270\r\n00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:28,066\r\nNFS, some going http if you had a need for that, but most of us don't.  So, at this stage, my server's up.  I'm hosting these images.  I'm \r\n\r\n271\r\n00:38:28,066 --> 00:38:35,532\r\nready to rock, and I get this connections tab over here and the connections tab, well, that's showing anybody who is connected to me right \r\n\r\n272\r\n00:38:35,533 --> 00:38:41,399\r\nnow and what they're doing.  Are they downloading an image.  Are they just staring at a list?  What is it that they're doing.  So, you \r\n\r\n273\r\n00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:50,033\r\ncan kind of monitor that progress on your server and see what's going on.  That really is it for NetInstall.  NetInstall is super simple to get \r\n\r\n274\r\n00:38:50,033 --> 00:38:58,699\r\ngoing.  The only thing to really remember is that the images have to be moved into that very specific path, that /library path that it created for \r\n\r\n275\r\n00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:07,733\r\nme.  All right, my server's up and running.  Now, my server is answering requests for anybody who is looking for me, as long as they're on the \r\n\r\n276\r\n00:39:07,733 --> 00:39:16,133\r\nsame network.  That's one thing to remember.  If you have a router sitting in between your client and the NetInstall server, they won't be able to \r\n\r\n277\r\n00:39:16,133 --> 00:39:22,433\r\ndiscover each other.  It's because they use Bonjour and broadcast and other protocols like that to be able to find each other so most of it's \r\n\r\n278\r\n00:39:22,433 --> 00:39:30,833\r\ndone via DHCP broadcast and so they'll find the server that way.  That kind of broadcast communication doesn't go through a router, so it \r\n\r\n279\r\n00:39:30,833 --> 00:39:37,533\r\ndoes need to be on the same network as the clients.  There are ways to get around that, but it's a little bit beyond what's on the exam.  But \r\n\r\n280\r\n00:39:37,533 --> 00:39:46,899\r\njust, for the exam, remember that they've got be on the same network.  So, now I can take a client and I can install one of these images. If I \r\n\r\n281\r\n00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:55,500\r\nhave a client that's already up, right, let me take this guy here.  So, here's a machine that is perfectly healthy and happy.  I can go into my \r\n\r\n282\r\n00:39:55,500 --> 00:40:07,366\r\nsystem preferences and I can go to my startup disk and the startup disk, that's where we pick what we're going to boot from and when I go to \r\n\r\n283\r\n00:40:07,366 --> 00:40:13,432\r\nstartup disk, it's going to show my local hard drive right away and then it's going to poll the network.  It's going to look out at the network \r\n\r\n284\r\n00:40:13,433 --> 00:40:20,866\r\nand say hey is there a NetInstall server out there?  And it found one and here I can see my clone of the client, and this is client1 so there's \r\n\r\n285\r\n00:40:20,866 --> 00:40:28,332\r\nthe clone of myself.  If I ever had some kind of damage on my system, I could restore that and that would put my system right back the way \r\n\r\n286\r\n00:40:28,333 --> 00:40:34,933\r\nthat it was.  I've also got the NetRestore we made.  That was the one that we put the modifications in and we added a user account \r\n\r\n287\r\n00:40:34,933 --> 00:40:43,899\r\nand things like that, and there is my NetInstall of Mavericks and so I could choose that.  I choose the option I want and I hit restart.  When it \r\n\r\n288\r\n00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:52,333\r\nrestarts, it's going to boot from the network.  It's going to reach out to that NetInstall and start that restore process, start doing that, so if I do \r\n\r\n289\r\n00:40:52,333 --> 00:40:59,199\r\nlike my clone, so I've done something on my system.  I've messed it up.  My software's not running right.  I want to restore back to that \r\n\r\n290\r\n00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:09,133\r\nclone that I made.  So, I'll choose that clone, and I'll hit restart, and we'll just let it restart.  And when it's going to reboot, it's going to boot \r\n\r\n291\r\n00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:15,033\r\nup and it is actually going to use the recovery partition on my hard drive just to get started, and then it will reach out over the network and \r\n\r\n292\r\n00:41:15,033 --> 00:41:26,099\r\ndownload the rest from the NetInstall server.  One word just to be aware of.  NetInstalls are slow.  When you boot, it's got to download this \r\n\r\n293\r\n00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:35,666\r\nstuff from the server, and that takes a little while.  If you have 100 MG network, it's not going to be terribly fast, so a NetInstall could take half an \r\n\r\n294\r\n00:41:35,666 --> 00:41:43,499\r\nhour.  Whereas, if you install from USB, it might only take 10 minutes.  So, it may take a little while while it goes through that process.  You \r\n\r\n295\r\n00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:53,033\r\njust kind of have to patient.  But here, it's going to reboot and it's going to reach out to that other server and it should jump into the NetRestore.  \r\n\r\n296\r\n00:41:53,033 --> 00:41:59,199\r\nSo, we'll give it just a moment.  I say should because I'm actually doing this on VMware Fusion.  Virtual machines are a little bit different \r\n\r\n297\r\n00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:04,233\r\nwith the way that they boot. On a physical machine, you know exactly what's going to happen.  On a virtual machine, things can be \r\n\r\n298\r\n00:42:04,233 --> 00:42:10,733\r\nflaky, but it should reach out and connect to it.  We'll give it a minute here while it does it.  It will be a little slower, so I'm going to allow for that, \r\n\r\n299\r\n00:42:10,733 --> 00:42:21,699\r\nbut soon it will be done.  While we're waiting on that, another example for us would be if we had a machine that was damaged and we had to go \r\n\r\n300\r\n00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:27,233\r\nto the store and buy a new hard drive and swap out the hard drive.  Maybe it wasn't under warranty anymore.  If you do a warranty hard \r\n\r\n301\r\n00:42:27,233 --> 00:42:36,733\r\ndrive replacement, then you call up Apple or Apple Care or you just take your device down to the Apple store, they'll swap out the hard drive, \r\n\r\n302\r\n00:42:36,733 --> 00:42:43,799\r\nand when they do that it'll already have Mac OS on it.  It's already there, so, we don't have to worry about it so much there.  But if you replace \r\n\r\n303\r\n00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:53,400\r\nthe hardware yourself, then you'll have to do it.  You know, it didn't boot off the network did it?  It just booted right back up off of our hard drive.  \r\n\r\n304\r\n00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:58,100\r\nAll right, so we'll have to do it manually.  So, when you boot off the network, though, it's going to reach out to that server and connect to that \r\n\r\n305\r\n00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:04,600\r\nimage and in here it never did and I know it didn't because if I come in here to my connections, I can see it's not even there in the list so it didn't \r\n\r\n306\r\n00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:13,000\r\ndo it.  I'm going to do another one.  I've got another machine that I kind of paused here.  Here's a machine that doesn't have Mac OS on \r\n\r\n307\r\n00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:21,266\r\nits hard drive so that there is no OS on its hard drive to boot from, and what I did is I booted it up from an OS 10 installer or Mavericks installer \r\n\r\n308\r\n00:43:21,266 --> 00:43:29,299\r\nand I just cancelled the install.  So, here I cancelled the install, and it's just kind of sitting here, and I can go into its startup disk and it will \r\n\r\n309\r\n00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:37,700\r\npull out over the network to look and see what it can find and I'll just choose that network install and I'll hit restart and it's going to reach out.  \r\n\r\n310\r\n00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:46,533\r\nNow, I can go and see if we actually connected, but we haven't connected, yet, so, I'll have to wait for this one to connect but it's going to \r\n\r\n311\r\n00:43:46,533 --> 00:43:55,399\r\nreach out and do that restart.  I'm pretty sure I clicked restart.  It's just thinking.  Yeah.  I've gotta wait my spinning lollipop of doom, there.  \r\n\r\n312\r\n00:43:55,400 --> 00:44:01,566\r\nSo, I've got to wait for that to finish, and as soon as it's done it is going to reboot and it will start that install from the server.  So, we'll give it just \r\n\r\n313\r\n00:44:01,566 --> 00:44:09,466\r\na moment there.  If this doesn't work, then I'll just grab one of our other Macs and do an install on camera that way, but this should reach out \r\n\r\n314\r\n00:44:09,466 --> 00:44:14,899\r\njust fine and get it.  The cool part here is you can create as many images as you need and you've just got your choice right there, you \r\n\r\n315\r\n00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:22,900\r\nknow, you pick the one you want and you restart.  If I choose that clone of OS 10 client1, then we'll boot and we'll restore that so it's kind \r\n\r\n316\r\n00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:30,633\r\nof neat.  In fact, you know what, let's do this.  I'm going to have some fun here.  I'm going to take my client1 and I'm going to delete its hard \r\n\r\n317\r\n00:44:30,633 --> 00:44:39,099\r\ndrive.  It's a virtual machine so it's really easy for me to delete its hard drive.  So, I'm going to just shut it down.  I'll delete it's hard drive and we'll \r\n\r\n318\r\n00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:49,200\r\nrestore it from one of the images, and then we'll be able to see that.  So, I'll just stick a blank hard drive on it.  Now, when it's got a blank hard \r\n\r\n319\r\n00:44:49,200 --> 00:45:00,566\r\ndrive and it boots up, it is not going to be able to boot, is it?  So, if I go into my settings here and I'll take that hard disk.  So, here's its hard drive \r\n\r\n320\r\n00:45:00,566 --> 00:45:08,266\r\nthat's got its OS and stuff on it, and I'm just going to remove it.  And I'll move that drive to the trash, and let me just empty my trash to make \r\n\r\n321\r\n00:45:08,266 --> 00:45:24,366\r\nsure it's actually gone.  There we go and I'll add in a new hard drive and let's make it a little bit bigger; 20 GB is going to be pressing it, so I'll \r\n\r\n322\r\n00:45:24,366 --> 00:45:32,866\r\ngo 64 GB.  There we go.  So, now I've got a new blank hard drive, and, normally, when you boot your computer up you would just hold down the \r\n\r\n323\r\n00:45:32,866 --> 00:45:41,966\r\nN key to boot from network or if you have a custom network adapter, it might have its own little BIOS that you have to go in and set.  But \r\n\r\n324\r\n00:45:41,966 --> 00:45:48,532\r\nfor this one because it's a virtual machine, it's going to be really hard for me to hold down N during boot, so what I'm going to do is I'm going \r\n\r\n325\r\n00:45:48,533 --> 00:45:55,399\r\nto use VMware's little startup disc option here and tell it to boot off the the network adapter.  So, I'm going to go ahead and hit that and tell it \r\n\r\n326\r\n00:45:55,400 --> 00:46:03,766\r\nto restart.  Okay.  So, now when it boots up, it's got a blank hard drive and so see my little message up here, attempting to start up \r\n\r\n327\r\n00:46:03,766 --> 00:46:12,732\r\nfrom EFI network.  It's reaching out on the network and it's trying to find something to boot from and when it reaches out over the network it \r\n\r\n328\r\n00:46:12,733 --> 00:46:21,433\r\nwill eventually find my server and so it'll show up in here as an entry and then I'll pick my image to restore and we'll go from there.  So, I just \r\n\r\n329\r\n00:46:21,433 --> 00:46:29,299\r\nhave to wait for a moment while it does that.  Notice my icon down here instead of the little spinning pinwheel, I see a spinning globe, and \r\n\r\n330\r\n00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:35,000\r\nthat's letting me know that it's reaching out on the network to boot.  This is what you would see if you held down the N key while booting.  So, \r\n\r\n331\r\n00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:41,933\r\nnow it's booting up, it's reaching out to the network and it'll find the server pretty quick.  It's probably already found it, but it's now got to \r\n\r\n332\r\n00:46:41,933 --> 00:46:49,133\r\ndownload a basic operating system, a simple operating system to be able to run from and depending on the speed of your network that \r\n\r\n333\r\n00:46:49,133 --> 00:46:57,466\r\nmay take a moment.  So, it's going to sit here while it does that until it gets to a screen.  We don't have to sit here and watch the globe.  \r\n\r\n334\r\n00:46:57,466 --> 00:47:04,566\r\nWhat we can do is we can take a break.  During the break, it will just find the server and I'll just stop it right there and when we come back we \r\n\r\n335\r\n00:47:04,566 --> 00:47:11,699\r\ncan see the process of actually restoring that imaging.  So, let's do that.  Let's stop here.  We'll take a break.  When we get back, we'll get \r\n\r\n336\r\n00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:16,866\r\nto see the rest of this, as we roll that image out to this machine.  So, stay tuned.  We'll be back in a few.  [\r\n\r\n337\r\n00:47:16,866 --> 00:47:24,499\r\nMusic]  \r\n\r\n338\r\n00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:32,533\r\nAll right, welcome back, everybody.  Okay, so during the break, the client reached out to the server, pulled down the initial screen, and then I \r\n\r\n339\r\n00:47:32,533 --> 00:47:40,966\r\ndidn't go forward any further.  It went from the gray screen with the globe right to this.  So, the very next screen you see is that install OS X. \r\n\r\n340\r\n00:47:40,966 --> 00:47:49,866\r\nNow, my hard drive is completely blank.  There's nothing in the CD drive so this is all being generated from the network.  Now, right here off \r\n\r\n341\r\n00:47:49,866 --> 00:47:57,499\r\nthe bat on my first screen, I see a problem.  It's saying that it wants to install OS X, and it's asking me to pick a hard drive.  Well, I've got \r\n\r\n342\r\n00:47:57,500 --> 00:48:05,833\r\ntwo drives here.  One is the NetInstall.  I definitely can't install to that.  The other one is the OS 10 base system.  That's the little mini \r\n\r\n343\r\n00:48:05,833 --> 00:48:11,966\r\noperating system it downloaded.  That's why it's got a globe on it.  That's the mini operating system that I'm running right now just to be able \r\n\r\n344\r\n00:48:11,966 --> 00:48:19,466\r\nto be online.  Okay?  Well, where's my hard drive.  My hard drive is not showing up so I can't \rchoose an install and my install button is grayed \r\n\r\n345\r\n00:48:19,466 --> 00:48:27,732\r\nout.  What I need to do is I need to format my hard drive.  I've got a brand new hard drive.  I bought it from the store.  So, it's blank.  It's got \r\n\r\n346\r\n00:48:27,733 --> 00:48:36,699\r\nnothing on there, and until I format it, it's not going to show up here.  So, all we have to do is go into our utilities menu up top and disk utility \r\n\r\n347\r\n00:48:36,700 --> 00:48:47,533\r\nand inside of our disk utility, we'll see our hard drive and we just need to partition it out.  So, I'm going to go in here and take my 68 GB disk \r\n\r\n348\r\n00:48:47,533 --> 00:48:58,299\r\nhere, and I'll just choose to partition it and we'll do a single partition.  I'll call it Macintosh HD, which is the default name, and we'll do Mac OS \r\n\r\n349\r\n00:48:58,300 --> 00:49:11,266\r\nExtended Journaled and we'll partition that out.  Once the drive is partitioned, now we'll be able to install it.  So, there we go.  That's set, and if I \r\n\r\n350\r\n00:49:11,266 --> 00:49:19,732\r\ngo back out to my screen, now I've got the Macintosh HD and I can pick that and I can do my install.  Now, I've got a couple of choices \r\n\r\n351\r\n00:49:19,733 --> 00:49:28,366\r\nabout what I want to do here.  One, I can do the install and I can actually install OS X in place here or I could use the startup disk option \r\n\r\n352\r\n00:49:28,366 --> 00:49:36,166\r\nbecause now I'm actually booted to an OS so I could go here to startup disk and I can choose to do one of my restores from there.  It's up to \r\n\r\n353\r\n00:49:36,166 --> 00:49:43,166\r\nyou if want to go straight into restoring the clone or if you want to go ahead and put a basic operating system on here first and then restore \r\n\r\n354\r\n00:49:43,166 --> 00:49:51,966\r\nit.  Either way is effective.  One just kind of saves a step.  I'll just go ahead and choose to do the install here, and when I do that, it's going \r\n\r\n355\r\n00:49:51,966 --> 00:50:00,532\r\nto move forward and here it goes restoring my image and it's going to put it back in place.  So, it's going to churn through this, and when it's \r\n\r\n356\r\n00:50:00,533 --> 00:50:11,799\r\ndone, my system will come up and I'll have my install.  Now, if I go to the server while it's doing this, the server screen, it refreshes every now \r\n\r\n357\r\n00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:19,800\r\nand then.  I've never been able to figure out the pattern of how often it refreshes, so I'm just in the habit of hitting that command R to refresh \r\n\r\n358\r\n00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:27,533\r\nbut I can see right here, here is that virtual machine I've got that's connected.  It got an IP address.  It's currently restoring an image, and \r\n\r\n359\r\n00:50:27,533 --> 00:50:35,599\r\nits 6% complete.  So, I can sit here and I can watch that progress.  If I've got 50 machines that are imaging right now, I can see their progress \r\n\r\n360\r\n00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:42,900\r\nright here.  This is just going into the the server app, going to net install, and hitting that connections tab up top.  That's where I can see \r\n\r\n361\r\n00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:50,966\r\neach of the connections. My other machine that I was going to do a clean install on, it's kind of locked up so it is still not registered here but \r\n\r\n362\r\n00:50:50,966 --> 00:51:00,066\r\nthis one's going.  I can see it progressing and moving forward.  So, it's going to move forward with that install and eventually it will finish.  So, \r\n\r\n363\r\n00:51:00,066 --> 00:51:06,466\r\nwe'll let it go.  We'll let it do its thing.  At this point, what do we do?  Well, not much of anything.  That machine is churning along, so \r\n\r\n364\r\n00:51:06,466 --> 00:51:14,932\r\nit's fine.  As we plan for the rest of our network, though, what you'll find is that you'll create many different images, different images for different \r\n\r\n365\r\n00:51:14,933 --> 00:51:22,033\r\ntypes of machines, lab machines, elementary school machines, high school machines, what ever it is for your business or organization or \r\n\r\n366\r\n00:51:22,033 --> 00:51:30,833\r\nwhatever, and when you buy new Macs, when you get these that come in, they'll already ship with Mac OS on them but you may format them \r\n\r\n367\r\n00:51:30,833 --> 00:51:36,766\r\nright from the very beginning, boot them off your network, and choose your image because your image will all ready have all the software you \r\n\r\n368\r\n00:51:36,766 --> 00:51:43,966\r\nneed, the user accounts created bound to your directory service, all those different things that you need, so you just download this image and \r\n\r\n369\r\n00:51:43,966 --> 00:51:50,532\r\napply it and instead of having to reconfigure and reinstall all that software, it all happens here automatically.  So, that's kind of a nice feature, \r\n\r\n370\r\n00:51:50,533 --> 00:52:01,466\r\nand it does make life a lot easier.  So, that's the real power behind this.  I do want to show you guys the finished product, but this is going to \r\n\r\n371\r\n00:52:01,466 --> 00:52:09,232\r\ntake a while, so what we might do is one of those magic of TV moments here where in real life I take a long pause, but in TV we take a real \r\n\r\n372\r\n00:52:09,233 --> 00:52:17,599\r\nbrief one.  So, why don't we do that?  We'll stop here and just take a TV timeout, and when it's done, we'll pick right back up, and we'll get to \r\n\r\n373\r\n00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:24,833\r\nsee the finished product of what happens when this restore is done.  All, right?  So, let's just do that.  We'll stop here.  We'll be back in just a \r\n\r\n374\r\n00:52:24,833 --> 00:52:25,966\r\nfew.  \r[\r\n\r\n375\r\n00:52:25,966 --> 00:52:32,032\r\nMusic]  \r\n\r\n376\r\n00:52:32,033 --> 00:52:40,133\r\nAll right, welcome back everybody.  Okay, so while the machine was sitting there running, it went through its 100% bar of downloading the \r\n\r\n377\r\n00:52:40,133 --> 00:52:47,399\r\nimage.  Afterwards, it basically repeats the process and goes through that 100% again verifying.  So, it verifies it has successfully \r\n\r\n378\r\n00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:55,833\r\ndownloaded it, and when it's done, it reboots, and so when I walked over to my laptop after letting it sit for, oh I don't know, about 15 almost \r\n\r\n379\r\n00:52:55,833 --> 00:53:02,699\r\n20 minutes now.  So, it sat for about 20 minutes and then it rebooted and now I'm here at this screen.  Now, this is a computer whose hard \r\n\r\n380\r\n00:53:02,700 --> 00:53:12,300\r\ndrive was completely blank a moment ago.  You guys saw where I had to format it.  So, it basically comes back up and I already know \r\n\r\n381\r\n00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:19,133\r\nthat it restored my image because I can see Don Pezet.  I've got a little hockey stick as chosen.  That was my icon from before, and I \r\n\r\n382\r\n00:53:19,133 --> 00:53:27,233\r\ncan punch in my password, assuming I remember it, and get logged in and I'm back in business.  I'll have my machine booted up.  I've \r\n\r\n383\r\n00:53:27,233 --> 00:53:35,566\r\ngot my same wallpaper, and I'm ready to rock.  So, we can bring our machines back from dead if we've got an image of them the way we want \r\n\r\n384\r\n00:53:35,566 --> 00:53:43,166\r\nor we can just rapidly provision them.  If I want Google Chrome to be on my machines and all these other different things, we put those in the \r\n\r\n385\r\n00:53:43,166 --> 00:53:49,899\r\nimage and we quickly deploy them.  The nice part about the network deployment here is I didn't need a USB key to do it.  I just booted my \r\n\r\n386\r\n00:53:49,900 --> 00:54:00,266\r\ncomputer from the network by holding N down while booting up the system.  If you need to do 1000 machines, you could walk down the row \r\n\r\n387\r\n00:54:00,266 --> 00:54:06,532\r\nholding N while they boot, start the installer, go to the next, go the next one, and keep doing that just moving down the line and getting them \r\n\r\n388\r\n00:54:06,533 --> 00:54:12,966\r\nall up and going.  If the machines are already up, you can just use that startup disk option so you don't even have to hold N while they reboot.  \r\n\r\n389\r\n00:54:12,966 --> 00:54:22,032\r\nStart off their installers and just let them run.  So, it's really cool, definitely kind of a step up from the USB side.  It does require that we \r\n\r\n390\r\n00:54:22,033 --> 00:54:30,266\r\nsetup that server piece to be sitting there with our images ready to rock, so it's not something that a home user is going to do.  Well, I don't \r\n\r\n391\r\n00:54:30,266 --> 00:54:37,832\r\nknow.  Maybe you set up a home server.  If you want you can do that.  I think Tim here, he has a little Mac mini he uses at home as a server, so \r\n\r\n392\r\n00:54:37,833 --> 00:54:44,899\r\nyou can go that route.  But, for a home user, sure you'll probably use the USB method.  For a business user, though, or somebody who \r\n\r\n393\r\n00:54:44,900 --> 00:54:52,900\r\nsupports a large quantity of Macs, being able to pull this stuff right from the network is super convenient, and when you buy a new set of \r\n\r\n394\r\n00:54:52,900 --> 00:54:59,333\r\nequipment, you get 50 new computers in, if you already have that image built up, you get the new machines, and you drop the image on \r\n\r\n395\r\n00:54:59,333 --> 00:55:06,433\r\nthem.  So, you're not having to install a bunch of software and go that route, right.  So, that method right there is a pretty easy way for \r\n\r\n396\r\n00:55:06,433 --> 00:55:15,199\r\ndeploying Mac OS.  The negatives of that method is it was the entire operating system.  We had to push that out, and if it's a lot of data \r\n\r\n397\r\n00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:23,066\r\ngoing over the network, it could take a while.  So, it's not necessarily the fastest method, but it does work.  In the next episode, we're going to \r\n\r\n398\r\n00:55:23,066 --> 00:55:30,732\r\ntake a look at at Remote Desktop, which will let us push out individual applications and settings so that we don't have to push a whole new OS, \r\n\r\n399\r\n00:55:30,733 --> 00:55:39,233\r\nthat if we get a new machine, we get a new Mac in, then we push our software to it and that's it.  A much smaller amount of data is a lot faster.  \r\n\r\n400\r\n00:55:39,233 --> 00:55:46,333\r\nSo that may be a good option, too.  Usually, you'll do a mixture of the two technologies.  So, don't just assume this is the only way to do it.  \r\n\r\n401\r\n00:55:46,333 --> 00:55:53,566\r\nThere's always more than one way to do things, but that's basically it for what we need to know for the exam.  Just remember that we've got \r\n\r\n402\r\n00:55:53,566 --> 00:56:00,832\r\nNetBoot, NetInstall, and NetRestore, and they really all work the same way.  NetBoot is where we boot our entire operating system from the \r\n\r\n403\r\n00:56:00,833 --> 00:56:08,999\r\nnetwork.  NetInstall is where we launch the installer from the network so that we can install Mac OS, and then NetRestore is where we \r\n\r\n404\r\n00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:18,000\r\nrestore an image of our machine putting it back to the way it was, which is effectively what I did right here.  I restored that image.  So, that's \r\n\r\n405\r\n00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:25,400\r\npretty much it for NetInstall.  Let me remind everybody, if you have any questions on this stuff, you can always post them in our live chat \r\n\r\n406\r\n00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:31,766\r\nroom.

Apple Remote Desktop benefits those managing a large quantity of Macs. Viewers will be shown how to set up clients and copy over files and install software on client profiles, as well as hear some of the ways ARD can be used to control the Macintosh system in a network, including: software distribution, remote assistance and administration, asset management and reporting, and automation.",

          "transcript": "1\r\n00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:34,166\r\n[music] \r\n\r\n2\r\n00:00:34,166 --> 00:00:40,166\r\nAll right, good morning, good afternoon, and good evening and welcome back to another episode of ITPro.  I'm your host, Don Pezet, \r\n\r\n3\r\n00:00:40,166 --> 00:00:47,499\r\nback again with another episode of Apple Certified Associate.  We're going to be diving right back into our Mac Management Basics \r\n\r\n4\r\n00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:57,500\r\nand looking at some really cool software called Apple Remote Desktop.  In the first two episodes, we took a look at creating an image of \r\n\r\n5\r\n00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:04,033\r\na machine that was set up the way that we wanted it to be and then deploying that image out to other machines to get them set up the \r\n\r\n6\r\n00:01:04,033 --> 00:01:12,399\r\nsame way and while there's a lot of positives to doing that there are some negatives, also, the biggest negative being time.  More than once in \r\n\r\n7\r\n00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:20,933\r\nthat episode, the Deployment episode, we would stop and take a break on the show while we let a machine image, because it took about 15 to \r\n\r\n8\r\n00:01:20,933 --> 00:01:27,799\r\n20 minutes to image a machine and it's just a long time to sit around and wait.  If you're imaging hundreds of machines or even \r\n\r\n9\r\n00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:35,666\r\nthousands of machines, it can take a long time and oftentimes we don't really want to change all that much.  For most people, when you buy a \r\n\r\n10\r\n00:01:35,666 --> 00:01:42,932\r\nMac and you get that device from Apple it's not like there is a lot of software on there that's a problem.  It's not like in the Windows world \r\n\r\n11\r\n00:01:42,933 --> 00:01:47,366\r\nwhere when you buy a Windows machine it's got all sorts of junk software on there and you don't know what the vendors have done to it and \r\n\r\n12\r\n00:01:47,366 --> 00:01:54,399\r\nit's a mess.  When you buy an Apple you get it from Apple and it is set up the way they they want it to be so for most of us it's not so much \r\n\r\n13\r\n00:01:54,400 --> 00:02:02,666\r\nthat we want to format that machine and redo it, we just want to add some things to it.  We want to add our own software.  Well, we can do that \r\n\r\n14\r\n00:02:02,666 --> 00:02:09,599\r\nusing Apple Remote Desktop.  You don't need to go and format the whole machine if you don't want to.  That means we can have much smaller \r\n\r\n15\r\n00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:16,133\r\npackages of information we're transmitting and we can manage a much greater amount of machines at once.  There are also some other \r\n\r\n16\r\n00:02:16,133 --> 00:02:26,199\r\nbenefits to the Remote Desktop Software beyond just deploying software.  The Remote Desktop software does all sorts of cool things.  \r\n\r\n17\r\n00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:32,400\r\nlt lets you see the screens of the remote system so that you can actually help.  If you're running like a lab at a middle school or high \r\n\r\n18\r\n00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:38,833\r\nschool or something, you could be a teacher sitting at the front room and see the desktop of all the machines in that room and when \r\n\r\n19\r\n00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:44,499\r\nsomebody needs help you can just pull up their screen instead of having to walk over there and look at that machine.  You can push software \r\n\r\n20\r\n00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:53,000\r\nout.  You can pull reports on the systems.  There's a lot that it can do, so let's start with just getting Remote Desktop installed.  Remote \r\n\r\n21\r\n00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:02,033\r\nDesktop is not a part of OS X by default, so it's not there as part of the default install.  Let me just get of it here, and so what we have to do is \r\n\r\n22\r\n00:03:02,033 --> 00:03:07,999\r\nwe have to go and get it.  It is in the app store, just like the server portion.  Remember, we had to go to the app store and get it?  Our big \r\n\r\n23\r\n00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:15,700\r\ndifference here is going to be the cost.  That server piece, when we went out and got the server app, it was $20, you know, not such a big \r\n\r\n24\r\n00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:25,300\r\ndeal, but the Remote Desktop, if I can spell it, apparently, that's going to be my challenge.  The Remote Desktop app itself, it's actually $80 so \r\n\r\n25\r\n00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:34,200\r\nit's a little bit more expensive for this one, but it is from Apple.  You can find it right there, Apple Remote Desktop.  It is a whopping 12.9 MB in \r\n\r\n26\r\n00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:42,100\r\nsize, so it's very, very small, but it's got a big price tag, right, $79.99, but it's really worth it.  If you're going to be managing Macs, managing a \r\n\r\n27\r\n00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:50,200\r\nlarge quantity of Macs, this software is really cool.  It just does so much neat stuff and they kind of describe it here, some of the things that \r\n\r\n28\r\n00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:56,966\r\nyou can do.  Software distribution is what I was mentioning.  We can push software out to our Macs, our new ones, our old ones.  We can \r\n\r\n29\r\n00:03:56,966 --> 00:04:02,866\r\npush software whenever we want.  We can do updates and things of that nature.  You can also do Remote Assistance.  That was another thing \r\n\r\n30\r\n00:04:02,866 --> 00:04:10,432\r\nI mentioned.  We can see the screens of the remote machines, either just for monitoring or to help people out.  Somebody says hey I'm \r\n\r\n31\r\n00:04:10,433 --> 00:04:14,833\r\nhaving a issue, you pull up their screen.  You say, all right, can you show me what's going on, and they can repeat the process and you both \r\n\r\n32\r\n00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:22,133\r\nsee it, so, really neat stuff there.  You have Remote Administration and we'll see that there's some neat stuff in there like you can remotely \r\n\r\n33\r\n00:04:22,133 --> 00:04:29,433\r\nlock screens, put the computers to sleep, reboot them, things of that nature.  We've got asset management and reporting, and we'll see \r\n\r\n34\r\n00:04:29,433 --> 00:04:35,866\r\na little bit of the reporting today where you can go in and you can pull up, you know, what type of hardware you've got in your systems and \r\n\r\n35\r\n00:04:35,866 --> 00:04:43,899\r\nother information like that and then lastly just general automation.  It uses workflows and you can automate certain activities across your \r\n\r\n36\r\n00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:52,366\r\nsystem, so it gives you some neat abilities there.  It's really cool software, software that, you know, again, a small business, a home user \r\n\r\n37\r\n00:04:52,366 --> 00:04:58,999\r\nprobably doesn't have need for this but if you're working in a larger business or an enterprise where you've got hundreds of Macs, thousands \r\n\r\n38\r\n00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:08,733\r\nof Macs, it's really cool software.  When you install it, though, it's not very impressive.  If you install it and bring it up, it doesn't really do much \r\n\r\n39\r\n00:05:08,733 --> 00:05:18,899\r\nand that's because we need to get all of our clients logged into this system before we can use it so if we're going to be using Remote \r\n\r\n40\r\n00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:24,866\r\nDesktop like this, we do have to enable it on our client machines.  Now, to enable it on the client machines there are just a few steps we have to \r\n\r\n41\r\n00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:33,099\r\ndo.  I've got my client that I was using earlier and I've already got it set up but I brought up another client before the show, this guy OS X-\r\n\r\n42\r\n00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:42,033\r\nclient2 and this one, it's a default install.  I just ran through the Mavericks installer, and the only thing I really did was change the wallpaper.  I \r\n\r\n43\r\n00:05:42,033 --> 00:05:49,266\r\njust changed the wallpaper so I could tell it apart from this one.  So, there's my client2.  This is the islands and the ocean wallpaper and so I'll \r\n\r\n44\r\n00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:57,266\r\nknow the difference now.  I want to get it set up for that Remote Management, for the Remote Desktop Utility.  What we do is we go into our \r\n\r\n45\r\n00:05:57,266 --> 00:06:07,166\r\nsystem preferences and in our system preferences we will go into sharing and inside of sharing you'll see all the different ways we can \r\n\r\n46\r\n00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:13,766\r\nshare access to our system via the network.  The one I'm looking for is this guy right here Remote Management and Remote Management \r\n\r\n47\r\n00:06:13,766 --> 00:06:23,166\r\nis turned off by default.  I'm going to check that to turn it on and it's going to ask what do I want to allow on the network.  What it's really saying \r\n\r\n48\r\n00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:31,532\r\nis what features of Apple Remote Desktop do you want to turn on?  Do you want to allow observation of the machine where somebody \r\n\r\n49\r\n00:06:31,533 --> 00:06:39,233\r\ncan see the screen of this computer remotely?  Well, we can check that off.  You've also got control.  Do you want them to just see the \r\n\r\n50\r\n00:06:39,233 --> 00:06:46,266\r\nscreen or do you want them to actually be able to take over the mouse and keyboard and work as if they were sitting there locally?  What about \r\n\r\n51\r\n00:06:46,266 --> 00:06:52,466\r\nthe person who is sitting at the computer.  Do you want them to know when they are being observed or do you want it to be a secret?  So, \r\n\r\n52\r\n00:06:52,466 --> 00:07:01,332\r\nyou can turn that option off and it's a secret.  So, we've kind of got that one.  Generate reports, open and quit applications, change \r\n\r\n53\r\n00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:07,199\r\nsettings, delete and replace items, most of these are pretty self-explanatory.  Delete and replace items, that is specifically talking about \r\n\r\n54\r\n00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:16,766\r\nfiles on the hard drive.  Start text chat or send messages, you can communicate using Remote Desktop.  Restart and shut down and copy \r\n\r\n55\r\n00:07:16,766 --> 00:07:24,966\r\nitems, as far as like software and other things.  So, we check off each of the different things we want to allow Apple Remote Desktop to do.  \r\n\r\n56\r\n00:07:24,966 --> 00:07:32,366\r\nNow, if we stop there, we can now get connected to this machine with Apple Remote Desktop, but there is a little problem here.  The \r\n\r\n57\r\n00:07:32,366 --> 00:07:41,632\r\nproblem is the default is allow access for all users.  Any user account on this system would have access to use Apple Remote Desktop, and \r\n\r\n58\r\n00:07:41,633 --> 00:07:48,266\r\nif you're connected to a directory service that's going to include your directory users so we typically want to restrict who it is that's allowed \r\n\r\n59\r\n00:07:48,266 --> 00:07:55,166\r\nto use Apple Remote Desktop.  We don't just want, you know, if you were a school, you wouldn't want a student to bring their own Mac \r\n\r\n60\r\n00:07:55,166 --> 00:08:02,366\r\nfrom home and fire up Apple Remote Desktop and start managing your systems so you want to make sure that you filter this down.  What I \r\n\r\n61\r\n00:08:02,366 --> 00:08:09,032\r\ngenerally recommend is creating a dedicated help desk user to use for this, so that's what I'm going to do.  I'm going to go back into my \r\n\r\n62\r\n00:08:09,033 --> 00:08:21,966\r\nsystem preferences and I'm going to go under users and groups and I'm going to add in a new user, which I'll just call helpdesk.  Now, if we \r\n\r\n63\r\n00:08:21,966 --> 00:08:27,999\r\nwere tied to a directory service, we could do it there but I'm doing it locally here, and if this were a  brand new machine it might not be \r\n\r\n64\r\n00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:34,700\r\nconnected to your directory, yet.  It's up to you how you want to go about it.  So, I'm just going to create this user and I'm going to set them as \r\n\r\n65\r\n00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:43,366\r\nan administrator so my help desk user can do whatever they need.  All right, there we go.  Help desk is an admin and I change the icon if I want.  \r\n\r\n66\r\n00:08:43,366 --> 00:08:52,032\r\nIt shouldn't really matter.  Well, I guess the icons aren't showing up so maybe I won't worry about that at all.  [laughter]  Now I'll go back into \r\n\r\n67\r\n00:08:52,033 --> 00:09:00,999\r\nmy sharing and I'm just going to restrict this down.  Under remote management, down here we can say allow access for only these users \r\n\r\n68\r\n00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:09,400\r\nand I'm going to add in that helpdesk user and that way if somebody would have to have that helpdesk user's password to be able to get in \r\n\r\n69\r\n00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:17,966\r\nthere and manage the system, it's not just opened to all users, you know, anybody who has an account on this system.  There we go.  \r\n\r\n70\r\n00:09:17,966 --> 00:09:25,332\r\nNow, it can be a little confusing looking at this screen because under remote management we also have the VNC settings, if somebody wants \r\n\r\n71\r\n00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:33,499\r\nto use VNC to view the screen, so up here you'll see computer settings  and that's really talking about VNC not what Apple Remote Desktop is \r\n\r\n72\r\n00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:44,833\r\ndoing.  Down here, this option button is where we go for the Apple Remote Desktop stuff.  Once I've got that set, this machine is now \r\n\r\n73\r\n00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:53,499\r\nready to be managed using Apple Remote Desktop, so I'm going to go ahead and I'll just close out of that and we'll see what we can do.  \r\n\r\n74\r\n00:09:53,500 --> 00:10:00,600\r\nThe first step, once I've got this set up ...  That's the client side.  The clients done.  Now, I need to jump over to the server, and my first step on \r\n\r\n75\r\n00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:09,066\r\nthe server is going to be getting all of my clients to show up here.  What we need to do is we need to scan our network and find those clients.  \r\n\r\n76\r\n00:10:09,066 --> 00:10:18,399\r\nWell, in the Apple Remote Desktop utility, you'll see I've got right here scanner, and if I go to scanner, it's got a few different ways that I can \r\n\r\n77\r\n00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:26,633\r\nscan to find my clients.  One of the easiest ways is right here, Bonjour.  The Bonjour protocol is a very simple network discovery \r\n\r\n78\r\n00:10:26,633 --> 00:10:34,233\r\nprotocol that a lot of Apple devices use and even a lot of of third-party devices use these days so we can scan our network and find it that way.  \r\n\r\n79\r\n00:10:34,233 --> 00:10:43,066\r\nYou can choose local network and actually have it just scan the IP addresses on your network.  That's another way to go about it.  Notice when I \r\n\r\n80\r\n00:10:43,066 --> 00:10:49,632\r\nwent Bonjour it didn't find anything.  Well, it's because I didn't hit that scan button over here.  Now, it's actually scanning and so I see server1\r\n\r\n81\r\n00:10:49,633 --> 00:10:59,166\r\n and client2.  I'm not seeing client...  Well, that's client1.  Its name is not showing up.  I might need to jump over and set its name real quick, \r\n\r\n82\r\n00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:06,366\r\nbut if I look at like my local network, it's scanning by IP.  Let me go fix that name.  See how my name there is just showing as a – for \r\n\r\n83\r\n00:11:06,366 --> 00:11:13,499\r\nsome reason?  I'm going to jump over to client1 and that name comes from that same sharing screen.  If I go into system preferences on \r\n\r\n84\r\n00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:21,300\r\nclient1, I can go under sharing and it's right here at the top and sure enough this one's got a blank name for some reason, probably from \r\n\r\n85\r\n00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:32,933\r\nwhere we restored it, so I'll just go and set that name.  There we go, so now if I repeat that scan, it should find it and actually have a name.  \r\n\r\n86\r\n00:11:32,933 --> 00:11:41,266\r\nThere we go, so I can scan by local network, which is just using an IP range, I can choose network range, and I can manually put in the IPs \r\n\r\n87\r\n00:11:41,266 --> 00:11:49,632\r\nthat I want to scan, if I have a particular IP address range.  You'll also see network address.  You can enter in a host individually; just one \r\n\r\n88\r\n00:11:49,633 --> 00:11:57,533\r\nmachine, if you want to add somebody specifically; file import, if you have a .csv file that lists all the machines that you want to \r\n\r\n89\r\n00:11:57,533 --> 00:12:07,433\r\nimport, you can bring it in that way; task server, task server we don't really get into for this show but when you run Apple Remote Desktop, you \r\n\r\n90\r\n00:12:07,433 --> 00:12:14,666\r\nmay actually have more than one of these.  If you're automating tasks across thousands of machines, it may be more than just one remote \r\n\r\n91\r\n00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:21,499\r\ndesktop server can handle so you may set up multiple servers so you'll typically have one server that's like the controller of the main Apple \r\n\r\n92\r\n00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:27,666\r\nRemote Desktop and then the others will be task servers, the ones that are actually performing the tasks that you command, so this \r\n\r\n93\r\n00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:35,166\r\nis where we would connect to a task server and get those other systems.  You can also choose directory server and if you've got directory \r\n\r\n94\r\n00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:43,332\r\nservices installed, you can connect to that and pull your hosts out of it.  I'll go back to just doing Bonjour for mine and I can see the different \r\n\r\n95\r\n00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:53,433\r\nmachines that are on my network.  If we want to manage them, all we have to do is highlight the machines that we want and drag them and drop \r\n\r\n96\r\n00:12:53,433 --> 00:13:01,199\r\nthem onto all computers.  When you drag and drop them to all computers, it's going to bring up the dialogue box.  We have to provide a user \r\n\r\n97\r\n00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:10,233\r\naccount that's allowed to manage that machine.  You'll remember I created that help desk account, so I'll just punch in that information.  \r\n\r\n98\r\n00:13:10,233 --> 00:13:17,133\r\nIt's got down here verify the username and password before adding.  That's a good idea.  If that's not checked, it's going to add it even if the \r\n\r\n99\r\n00:13:17,133 --> 00:13:24,599\r\npassword is wrong and you won't know it's wrong until the first time you run a task and the task fails so it's a good idea to have it verify.  \r\n\r\n100\r\n00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:31,266\r\nUse this name and password on remaining computer is checked.  It's going to try this same one on the other computers.  If you use the \r\n\r\n101\r\n00:13:31,266 --> 00:13:37,499\r\nsame name and password on every computer, that works out great.  I don't recommend that, though.  For example, if you're in a school and a \r\n\r\n102\r\n00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:42,933\r\nstudent figures out the password on one machine, now they would know it on all the machines so it's kind of nice to use a different \r\n\r\n103\r\n00:13:42,933 --> 00:13:50,366\r\npassword on each machine, if you can.  In my case, I did use the same so I can leave that checked.  And then, apply default off-line \r\n\r\n104\r\n00:13:50,366 --> 00:13:58,866\r\nreporting... we don't have a policy in place for that, yet, but this will just set the defaults for that and that's good for me.  I'll go ahead and hit \r\n\r\n105\r\n00:13:58,866 --> 00:14:05,732\r\nadd and it's going to add it.  Notice it didn't ask me for the second computer and that's because I told it to use the same username and \r\n\r\n106\r\n00:14:05,733 --> 00:14:13,999\r\npassword so it got them both.  If you're managing a note, you'll see a little blue circle by its name right here under the scanner so that \r\n\r\n107\r\n00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:24,400\r\nmeans that I've already got it in my system, and if I go to all computers, sure enough, I can see it right there.  So, that's step one.  I import my \r\n\r\n108\r\n00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:32,866\r\nclients into my server, so now I've got them right here in Apple Remote Desktop.  If you're just managing a few machines, then you'd probably \r\n\r\n109\r\n00:14:32,866 --> 00:14:39,232\r\njust leave it like this, not a lot of need to mess around with it more, but if you've got a ton of machines, you're probably going to want to \r\n\r\n110\r\n00:14:39,233 --> 00:14:45,366\r\nperform actions in groups and so there's probably some way you'd divide up your machines.  Maybe you'd divide them up by \r\n\r\n111\r\n00:14:45,366 --> 00:14:53,566\r\ndepartment, so if you do that, you'll probably want to create computer lists.  Computer lists are ways that we can subdivide our machines.  If \r\n\r\n112\r\n00:14:53,566 --> 00:15:02,899\r\nyou're a a business, you might have things like marketing and sales and so on, so you kind of divide things up that way.  For a school, you \r\n\r\n113\r\n00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:09,533\r\nmight have elementary and middle school or grade 5, grade 6 or whatever, It just depends on your organization how you want to divide these \r\n\r\n114\r\n00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:20,799\r\nup. What we can do is if we want to to kind of divide these machines up, we can create lists. If you go up to file, you'll see a new list option and \r\n\r\n115\r\n00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:27,233\r\nyou can create a list.  The default is to create an empty list.  If you've got machines highlighted in the background, though, you can choose new \r\n\r\n116\r\n00:15:27,233 --> 00:15:35,166\r\nlist from selection and it will automatically put those nodes in that list so like I had server selected so now it's moved it over here and so I \r\n\r\n117\r\n00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:50,566\r\ncan create a list called servers.  So, now I've got my OS X server is inside of servers and so I might create another list called workstations, \r\n\r\n118\r\n00:15:50,566 --> 00:15:58,799\r\nand I just created an empty list there so I'll need to go under all computers and grab my clients and drag them and drop them into workstations.  \r\n\r\n119\r\n00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:06,600\r\nSo, now they're here in workstations and they're here in servers, well, the servers in servers.  The cool part about these lists is that when I perform \r\n\r\n120\r\n00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:14,200\r\nan action, if I want to do something to every machine in my entire network, I can do it right here to all computers and everybody will get it \r\n\r\n121\r\n00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:21,300\r\nbut if I just want workstations to get or if I just want servers to get it, I can do it from these other lists and a node can be in more than one \r\n\r\n122\r\n00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:27,833\r\nlist so you might have subdivisions of workstations so you might have workstations for all of your workstations and then you might have \r\n\r\n123\r\n00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:35,366\r\nworkstations – grade 5, workstations – grade 6, and you know for each of the different grades so you can push out custom software or \r\n\r\n124\r\n00:16:35,366 --> 00:16:42,966\r\nmanagement or whatever, whatever your needs happen to be.  So, a lot of flexibility there in how we want to handle that, you know how we want \r\n\r\n125\r\n00:16:42,966 --> 00:16:51,432\r\nto connect up to those systems and work with them.  Now, we can start taking advantage of some of the other features that are inside of \r\n\r\n126\r\n00:16:51,433 --> 00:17:01,499\r\nApple Remote Desktop, things like, you know, the remote screen monitor, okay?  So, somebody is working on client1 and they're \r\n\r\n127\r\n00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:10,800\r\nhaving a problem.  It's not working out for them.  Well, you'll notice up here the buttons that we have, observe, control, curtain.  If I take client1 \r\n\r\n128\r\n00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:20,466\r\nand I hit observe, what it's going to do is it is going to reach out, connect to that machine, and I can now see that remote machine.  I can't \r\n\r\n129\r\n00:17:20,466 --> 00:17:32,099\r\nclick on anything because I'm just observing. I'm just looking.  I'm not actually controlling and if I jump over to that other machine, here I am.  I \r\n\r\n130\r\n00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:40,633\r\ndon't even know that I'm being observed, do I?  I don't see anything different here on my system and I can start to work.  I'll fire up Chrome and I'll \r\n\r\n131\r\n00:17:40,633 --> 00:17:51,966\r\ngo to itpro.tv.  So, I start working.  I browse out to the internet.  Things are normal to me.  Meanwhile, back here, they see what I'm doing.  \r\n\r\n132\r\n00:17:51,966 --> 00:17:58,632\r\nWhen they point at things like that with the circle, that actually does show up on the other side so they can see what I'm talking about.  I \r\n\r\n133\r\n00:17:58,633 --> 00:18:05,133\r\ndon't have a good way to show both of those at the same time.  You know, maybe if I take them out of full-screen or something.  Let me see if \r\n\r\n134\r\n00:18:05,133 --> 00:18:21,299\r\nthere's a way I can show those both at the same time.  So, there's client1 and here's my server that's kind of monitoring that.  See how when I \r\n\r\n135\r\n00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:28,100\r\nhighlight over on the left on the right side it sees it, too, so I'm just observing but here if I'm talking to them on the phone, I can say look, \r\n\r\n136\r\n00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:34,166\r\nlook at this button right here.  You just need to click on this button or this button up here; click on that, and they know what I'm talking about \r\n\r\n137\r\n00:18:34,166 --> 00:18:41,832\r\nbecause I can kind of show them visually but I don't control their machine.  I can't click the mouse for them, so that's kind of the whole point \r\n\r\n138\r\n00:18:41,833 --> 00:19:00,566\r\nof that feature.  So, let me put this guy back over here and where did my server go?  Here.  Okay.  All right.  Now, that's just observe.  I can \r\n\r\n139\r\n00:19:00,566 --> 00:19:11,066\r\nditch out of observe and switch over to control and if I control the client, it looks basically the same, except now I'm actually controlling their \r\n\r\n140\r\n00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:20,099\r\nmachine.  See how I can actually click on some of these menu bars?  I can resize their window, so now I'm actually working with their machine.  \r\n\r\n141\r\n00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:27,400\r\nSo, sometimes it's faster just to do something for somebody then it is to say all right I need you to click on this button and then this one.  \r\n\r\n142\r\n00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:36,266\r\nYou know, here we can just jump in and make the change ourselves.  Notice there are several buttons up here.  I didn't really talk about these.  \r\n\r\n143\r\n00:19:36,266 --> 00:19:43,199\r\nIf you float over each one, it kind of gives you a hint, as far as what each one does, and the very first one is the one that switches between \r\n\r\n144\r\n00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:53,033\r\ncontrol and observe.  So, you might choose to stay in observe at first and then only after they fail to do what you tell them do you switch over \r\n\r\n145\r\n00:19:53,033 --> 00:19:59,799\r\nto control and jump in.  So, that's one option.  You'll see some of the other buttons up here, share control with the user so you both have \r\n\r\n146\r\n00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:07,500\r\ncontrol at the same time.  That's the default.  If you turn that off and you're in control, you've now got control and they don't.  They can't use their \r\n\r\n147\r\n00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:16,200\r\nown machine any more, so you can kind of lock them out.  You will also see the other options like fit screen in window just to resize or lock \r\n\r\n148\r\n00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:33,233\r\ncomputer screen while you control.  That's that curtain option.  If you hit that...I'll just say screen is locked while we perform maintenance, \r\n\r\n149\r\n00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:39,399\r\nwhich I'm spelling wrong.  There we go, maintenance.  Okay.  To me, the screen doesn't look much different.  I can get in here and \r\n\r\n150\r\n00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:47,200\r\ncontrol and work with it, but to the person on the other end this is what they see:  Screen is locked while we perform maintenance.  Screen \r\n\r\n151\r\n00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:55,166\r\nlocked by Don Pezet.  They know that they can't use this machine right now because we locked it, so if you have an employee who is \r\n\r\n152\r\n00:20:55,166 --> 00:21:00,599\r\ndoing something inappropriate, you can lock their machine real quick and the only thing they can do is cut the power to it.  Otherwise, they \r\n\r\n153\r\n00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:09,433\r\ncan't actually use it.  When we're done, we can unlock it, and you'll see back here now the employee is back into their machine and able to \r\n\r\n154\r\n00:21:09,433 --> 00:21:19,733\r\nwork.  Some of the other things, we can take a screen shot, if we need to, we can deal with the clipboard, as far as cut, copy, and paste, and \r\n\r\n155\r\n00:21:19,733 --> 00:21:25,699\r\nyou can even adjust the color quality.  If it starts running a little slow, like here we've got this video running and maybe things start running a \r\n\r\n156\r\n00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:35,133\r\nlittle too choppy for me, so we can start to reduce the color quality and the crummier you make that video quality, the more smoothly it's \r\n\r\n157\r\n00:21:35,133 --> 00:21:43,933\r\ngoing to run.  So, if you're on a like a real low band width link, that can help things out a good bit.  So, those are some of the neat things we \r\n\r\n158\r\n00:21:43,933 --> 00:21:50,733\r\ncan do as far as remotely controlling those systems, and you know, there's a lot of cool stuff in there, as far as just being able to see \r\n\r\n159\r\n00:21:50,733 --> 00:21:59,433\r\nand help people.  There are some other things in here you'll see, so that was the remote control, these three buttons here.  I'm going to talk about \r\n\r\n160\r\n00:21:59,433 --> 00:22:06,466\r\ncopy and install in a minute.  We've got the UNIX button.  With the UNIX button, here's where we can send shell commands to those \r\n\r\n161\r\n00:22:06,466 --> 00:22:15,532\r\nother systems, so if you want to execute some kind of bash or shell script or run some other execution command, you can do it right here.  \r\n\r\n162\r\n00:22:15,533 --> 00:22:23,766\r\nYou just type this series of commands, specify the user it should run as, and then send it or if you want, you can schedule it to run at a \r\n\r\n163\r\n00:22:23,766 --> 00:22:30,366\r\nparticular time.  So maybe you do some kind of manual backup, you know, you copy some files off of it or something or maybe you want to \r\n\r\n164\r\n00:22:30,366 --> 00:22:37,932\r\npurge a log file or cache or something of that nature, you can put the commands in here and schedule it, so it's kind of a neat thing if you \r\n\r\n165\r\n00:22:37,933 --> 00:22:49,299\r\nwanted to go into the real nitty-gritty.  We also have our reports piece.  When you go into reporting, here is where we can start to see all \r\n\r\n166\r\n00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:57,200\r\nsorts of information about our remote machines, and there are a ton of different reports built in here.  If you just browse around and poke \r\n\r\n167\r\n00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:06,133\r\naround, you can find all sorts of neat stuff here; like here they're pulling up computer clock speeds and other information.  We'd just kind of \r\n\r\n168\r\n00:23:06,133 --> 00:23:16,033\r\nlook at some of these under software kernel version, system version.  We've got storage information, free disk space, total disk space.  \r\n\r\n169\r\n00:23:16,033 --> 00:23:23,633\r\nSo, all sorts of information here and you can just check off the information you want or you can uncheck the information you don't want and then \r\n\r\n170\r\n00:23:23,633 --> 00:23:30,199\r\nyou can pick the clients you want to run it under and choose get report and when you get that report it's going to run and generate it.  It's going \r\n\r\n171\r\n00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:37,100\r\nto collect it and it's going to put it together right here in a nice little output for you.  Oh, you know, I only had one computer selected.  Let \r\n\r\n172\r\n00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:44,800\r\nme go back up to workstations here.  All right, I want to run the report but I want all of my all my workstations. So, I'm going to go back to \r\n\r\n173\r\n00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:56,200\r\nreporting, and this time see how it's got both of my clients down here?  So, if I get that report, it's going to run it.  There it goes and now \r\n\r\n174\r\n00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:03,500\r\nI can see all of my workstations, so if I want to get a good idea of how many computers I have, whether some need to be upgraded, if some are \r\n\r\n175\r\n00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:13,033\r\ntoo old, if I get the new version of OS X and I want to install it but I need to see what hardware is compatible, I can start to look about with this \r\n\r\n176\r\n00:24:13,033 --> 00:24:21,199\r\nand get an idea.  All the information is displayed on the main screen, but it breaks it down into tabs.  So, I can see, you know, your serial \r\n\r\n177\r\n00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:29,400\r\nnumbers of units the model of the machine, the software that they're running.  I can see their storage information so I can identify machines \r\n\r\n178\r\n00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:39,266\r\nrunning out of space, if there are any wireless networks or they're wired.  Here are their IP addresses, their display information and any \r\n\r\n179\r\n00:24:39,266 --> 00:24:46,599\r\nother information, as far as like Remote Desktop being configured.  So,  we can see all sorts of neat stuff in here based on whatever it is we \r\n\r\n180\r\n00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:54,000\r\nchoose to put in the report.  Now,  by default you're going to view these reports right here in the Remote Desktop Report Viewer, but if you \r\n\r\n181\r\n00:24:54,000 --> 00:25:01,166\r\nwant to send these to somebody, you've got this nice little export button and you can export the report and you'll see that it's going to export it ... \r\n\r\n182\r\n00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:09,632\r\nthe default is just to export it as a tab separated values file.  You can change that to a comma separated.  That's a little more common and \r\n\r\n183\r\n00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:18,966\r\nnow once it's exported it can be imported into any spreadsheet software.  If you use you like Sheets or Microsoft Excel or something like \r\n\r\n184\r\n00:25:18,966 --> 00:25:25,966\r\nthat, you can load this .csv right into there and then do whatever you want with the report so you get a lot of good information.  That serial \r\n\r\n185\r\n00:25:25,966 --> 00:25:32,366\r\nnumber one, that's really handy because if you're trying to track assets, if you're trying to do asset reports, you need to know those serial \r\n\r\n186\r\n00:25:32,366 --> 00:25:40,399\r\nnumbers so that you can report the hardware that you have.  A lot of organizations, your accountants will require you to do,  let me see if \r\n\r\n187\r\n00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:46,866\r\nI can remember all of the terms.  You're hardware value depreciates over time and you can write that off on your taxes and it gets \r\n\r\n188\r\n00:25:46,866 --> 00:25:54,466\r\nbeyond me.  You give me a computer, I can do stuff.  You give me a tax form and I'm lost but these are the kind of reports that can generate \r\n\r\n189\r\n00:25:54,466 --> 00:26:03,032\r\nthat information for us and really make people happy, people other than me, I suppose.  [laughter]  All right, so, that's the reporting \r\n\r\n190\r\n00:26:03,033 --> 00:26:11,399\r\npiece, pretty neat stuff kind of stuck in here.  With everything that I did there,  like when I generated those reports, those get stored here \r\n\r\n191\r\n00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:18,633\r\nin my history so I can see those reports that were generated and they're still available.  I can go and pull them up.  As we perform other tasks \r\n\r\n192\r\n00:26:18,633 --> 00:26:25,633\r\nwith this, like pushing out software, we will see that show up in our history, too, so if you ever have a failed task, you can go in there and look \r\n\r\n193\r\n00:26:25,633 --> 00:26:33,399\r\nand get some information on it.  If there are tasks that are running right now, you can see them under active tasks.  The ones I ran just \r\n\r\n194\r\n00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:40,633\r\ntook a few seconds but some tasks might take a long time to run and so you'll see them here or they might be scheduled,  like with the UNIX \r\n\r\n195\r\n00:26:40,633 --> 00:26:48,499\r\ncommand we might schedule that to run later and so we'll show that under the active tasks.   If we're using a task server, a remote server,  you \r\n\r\n196\r\n00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:58,600\r\nknow,  a separate server to handle the actual execution, then I would see that information here under Task Server.  Now, that's a basic overview \r\n\r\n197\r\n00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:06,933\r\nof the functionality of Remote Desktop minus the two most important ones, these guys right here, copy and install.  Looking at the clock I'm \r\n\r\n198\r\n00:27:06,933 --> 00:27:14,233\r\na little short on time for this segment, so let's do this.  Let's stop and take a break, and when we get back, I'll show you copy and install and how \r\n\r\n199\r\n00:27:14,233 --> 00:27:22,499\r\nwe can use them in place of the NetInstall and NetRestore options we learned about in the first two shows.  So, stay tuned.  More Remote \r\n\r\n200\r\n00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:23,566\r\nDesktop after this.  \r\n\r\n201\r\n00:27:23,566 --> 00:27:30,332\r\n[music]  \r\n\r\n202\r\n00:27:30,333 --> 00:27:38,566\r\nAll right, welcome back.  So what we're going to do now is we're going to take a look at deploying software to a machine.  So, we just bought a \r\n\r\n203\r\n00:27:38,566 --> 00:27:44,732\r\nbatch of new Macs.  We bring them up on our network, and now we want to get them set up with the software that we need for our \r\n\r\n204\r\n00:27:44,733 --> 00:27:51,566\r\norganization.  We could deploy an image. You could do a NetRestore to them and push an image.  It's got everything set up just the way \r\n\r\n205\r\n00:27:51,566 --> 00:27:58,866\r\nyou want.  That works out great for a lot of people, or if we just want to install some software, we can quickly do it right here from \r\n\r\n206\r\n00:27:58,866 --> 00:28:06,599\r\nApple Remote Desktop, and that's what I'm going to do.  You've got two ways to install software on another machine.  The most \r\n\r\n207\r\n00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:13,433\r\ncommon way is to use this install button right here at the top.  You pick the machine, you hit install, and you push now.  You can pick more \r\n\r\n208\r\n00:28:13,433 --> 00:28:19,533\r\nthan one machine at once, and you can pick an entire list if you want.  If we want to go to all of our workstations, for example.  We can do that \r\n\r\n209\r\n00:28:19,533 --> 00:28:28,466\r\nand deploy software based on that list.  So, there's all sorts of different options there.  Let's say, for example, you know, I've got my disk \r\n\r\n210\r\n00:28:28,466 --> 00:28:36,432\r\nclient, this guy right here, who's already got Chrome installed and I think during the earlier shows didn't we install Block Story or \r\n\r\n211\r\n00:28:36,433 --> 00:28:43,766\r\nsomething, yeah.  So, it's got Block Story on it, so it's got a couple of little programs that are there and I installed those just by manually \r\n\r\n212\r\n00:28:43,766 --> 00:28:50,732\r\ninstalling them.  If we want to install them via Apple Remote Desktop, it is pretty straight forward.  We just pick a machine.  I'll take \r\n\r\n213\r\n00:28:50,733 --> 00:28:59,666\r\nclient2 because client2 doesn't have of that stuff.  Client2 doesn't have... Chrome is not on the list and old Block Story is not there on the list either \r\n\r\n214\r\n00:28:59,666 --> 00:29:10,566\r\nso nothing really present right here on client2.  So, I'll go back to my server and I'll pick client2, and, you know, like I said, you could highlight all \r\n\r\n215\r\n00:29:10,566 --> 00:29:16,632\r\nyour machines, push out to all of them, if you wanted, but I just want to go client2 because I know client1 already has the software.  So, I'm \r\n\r\n216\r\n00:29:16,633 --> 00:29:24,833\r\ngoing to choose the install package button, and I'll pick the software I want to load.  Now, my first limitation here is going to be that this is \r\n\r\n217\r\n00:29:24,833 --> 00:29:33,399\r\ngoing to install packages, so I need software that comes in the .pkg file format and I know we've talked about that before.  Well, before the \r\n\r\n218\r\n00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:40,733\r\nshow, I downloaded some of the software that I want to push out, so I've got like Block Story right there, which is a package and I grab \r\n\r\n219\r\n00:29:40,733 --> 00:29:50,033\r\nMicrosoft Silverlight, somebody runs it, and so I've got it there as a package, also.  But look at like Google Chrome, for example.  Google \r\n\r\n220\r\n00:29:50,033 --> 00:29:59,966\r\nChrome comes in a .dmg.  It's a disk image and so it doesn't actually have a package file for me.  So, I won't be able to use the install software \r\n\r\n221\r\n00:29:59,966 --> 00:30:07,132\r\nlink, this install packages with Chrome, so I'll have to push that a different way.  So maybe for right now, I'll settle for doing Silverlight and Block \r\n\r\n222\r\n00:30:07,133 --> 00:30:15,266\r\nStory.  So, I'll push those two out, and I don't think I actually installed Silverlight on client1 so maybe I will go ahead and do both of them.  So, \r\n\r\n223\r\n00:30:15,266 --> 00:30:25,532\r\nnow I'm doing both client1 and client2, and I'm just going to add in the packages that I want to install.  So, I'm going to add in block story, and \r\n\r\n224\r\n00:30:25,533 --> 00:30:35,299\r\nI'll go ahead and add in Silverlight.  So, I'm just adding in those packages, and you can add in as many as need, and then you've got options \r\n\r\n225\r\n00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:41,833\r\ndown here about what to do after it deploys.  Don't restart?  Well, neither of these applications require restarts, so there's not \r\n\r\n226\r\n00:30:41,833 --> 00:30:49,199\r\nreally a need for it, but I can tell it to attempt to restart, allow users to save documents, or I can force an immediate restart, if this is an urgent \r\n\r\n227\r\n00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:57,266\r\nthing that I'm pushing out.  Also, it's got run this task from.  I can run it from this application.  That's normally what we want, or if you've got a \r\n\r\n228\r\n00:30:57,266 --> 00:31:06,466\r\ntask server you can tell it to offload this onto one of the task servers.  All right, we've got stop the copy on all targets if a problem occurs.  That \r\n\r\n229\r\n00:31:06,466 --> 00:31:13,632\r\nmeans that if one machine fails, it will stop it on all of them.  That's usually not what we want so I'm not going to check that.  Encrypt network \r\n\r\n230\r\n00:31:13,633 --> 00:31:21,799\r\ndata is chosen by default.  If you're pushing out software it'll encrypt that communication.  Allow untrusted certificates.  This is one that I forget a \r\n\r\n231\r\n00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:31,333\r\nlot.  When you download software, if it's been digitally signed by Apple or one of the CAs that Apple trusts, then you can push that and it will \r\n\r\n232\r\n00:31:31,333 --> 00:31:38,666\r\npass that certificate open, but a lot of certificates that are out there or just a lot of software in general are not signed or not trusted.  \r\n\r\n233\r\n00:31:38,666 --> 00:31:44,632\r\nSo, when you download a program from the internet and you run it, a lot of times you get that security message saying, you know, this \r\n\r\n234\r\n00:31:44,633 --> 00:31:50,366\r\nsoftware is downloaded from the internet and we can't run it, and you have to do that open option to get around that.  Well, that happens with our \r\n\r\n235\r\n00:31:50,366 --> 00:31:58,099\r\npackage files, too, and in fact, I know that Block Story is not signed.  Silverlight probably is.  So, I'm going to go ahead and say allow untrusted \r\n\r\n236\r\n00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:05,100\r\ncertificates to make sure that this software can get installed.  Basically, you're saying I know this software came from a trusted location, so I \r\n\r\n237\r\n00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:13,166\r\ndon't need to validate a certificate.  Now, depending on the size of your software, both of these are pretty small.  Actually, I don't \r\n\r\n238\r\n00:32:13,166 --> 00:32:20,299\r\nremember how big they are.  They're not big at all, though.  So, both of these are pretty small, looks like about 100 MB, all said and done, so, \r\n\r\n239\r\n00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:26,966\r\nI'm not too worried about bandwidth, but if you're pushing several GB of software and you're pushing out to thousands of machines, you may \r\n\r\n240\r\n00:32:26,966 --> 00:32:33,999\r\nneed to limit the bandwidth so you don't overwhelm your network with copies.  I'm not going to bother with that for mine.  And then \r\n\r\n241\r\n00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:41,266\r\ndown here I see the clients, and I can schedule the install or I can go ahead and run it right now and that's what I'm going to do.  I'm going to go \r\n\r\n242\r\n00:32:41,266 --> 00:32:48,566\r\nahead and run it.  Now, when it runs, you'll see back here it's receiving the items.  It's copying them across the network.  I can see that status \r\n\r\n243\r\n00:32:48,566 --> 00:32:57,032\r\nright here and it's showing up under my active tasks so I can go on and start to do something else.  I don't have to sit here and wait.  I can do \r\n\r\n244\r\n00:32:57,033 --> 00:33:05,299\r\nother things while that task runs right there in the background.  When it's done, it'll move from active tasks down to history, and hopefully, it will \r\n\r\n245\r\n00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:12,333\r\nhave a little check mark by it.  The check mark means it successfully completed.  If you see an exclamation point, that means a failure \r\n\r\n246\r\n00:33:12,333 --> 00:33:19,566\r\nhappened somewhere along the way and it wasn't able to install.  So, here I can see my install packages made it and it's got the little \r\n\r\n247\r\n00:33:19,566 --> 00:33:32,966\r\ncheck mark.  So now if I jump over to client2, here's my client2, and if I go into my little search here and look for Block Story.  There it is.   \r\n\r\n248\r\n00:33:32,966 --> 00:33:39,366\r\nAll right, so I can fire that up, and we can start playing some Block Story.  I'll have to get my son on the show.  He can show us how to do it.  [\r\n\r\n249\r\n00:33:39,366 --> 00:33:49,266\r\nlaughter]  So, we can fire that up and start to play.  I'll just quit.  Or I also have Silverlight, now, right?  So, I could test that out.  Let me fire up \r\n\r\n250\r\n00:33:49,266 --> 00:34:00,066\r\nSafari and see if there's a way I can test that, test Silverlight.  There's got to be some kind of Silverlight test out there.  Here.  Silverlight Balls \r\n\r\n251\r\n00:34:00,066 --> 00:34:09,166\r\nAnimation Test.  There we go.  I see green balls.  So, Silverlight must be working.  So, I pushed that software out.  The end user didn't have to do \r\n\r\n252\r\n00:34:09,166 --> 00:34:17,832\r\nanything.  Their machine just magically has the software that I want them to have and they're good to go.  Now, that's software that has a \r\n\r\n253\r\n00:34:17,833 --> 00:34:25,833\r\npackage file, a .pkg.  So, if you've got software that has a .pkg file, that's the way you do it, really straightforward.  Okay?  What if you don't, \r\n\r\n254\r\n00:34:25,833 --> 00:34:33,166\r\nthough?  What if you have something like Google Chrome where it doesn't have a .pkg?  All right.  Well, here's what we need to do.  First \r\n\r\n255\r\n00:34:33,166 --> 00:34:41,066\r\noff, we need to get the application out of that .dmg file, so I'm going to go in here and just double-click on that googlechrome.dmg and \r\n\r\n256\r\n00:34:41,066 --> 00:34:49,232\r\nthat's going to mount it, right?  I'll see it show up over here as a drive eventually.  Oh, there it is up top, and here is the actual application and \r\n\r\n257\r\n00:34:49,233 --> 00:34:55,733\r\nnormally they want you to drag it and drop it into applications.  I'm going to drag it and drop it over here into my little downloads folder so that I've \r\n\r\n258\r\n00:34:55,733 --> 00:35:04,899\r\ngot it sitting right here so it's going to extract out, and then I'll have the actual application file.  I'm doing that because I'm on my server.  If I \r\n\r\n259\r\n00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:14,000\r\ndon't mind installing it, yeah, I could drag it to my applications folder.  That would work fine.  Now, I can go back to Apple Remote Desktop \r\n\r\n260\r\n00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:24,300\r\nand I can select my clients and instead of using the install button, I can use the copy button.  The copy button is really designed to copy files.  \r\n\r\n261\r\n00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:33,333\r\nApple recommends like less than 10 at a time, but copying files and we can copy that Google Chrome file straight into the applications folder \r\n\r\n262\r\n00:35:33,333 --> 00:35:38,966\r\non those remote machines.  It is the equivalent of installing it, right?  When you install Chrome, that's all you're doing.  You're just dragging this \r\n\r\n263\r\n00:35:38,966 --> 00:35:48,899\r\none file into your applications folder, so that's what I'm going to do.  I'm going to go in here and I'll choose copy and the item I want to copy, I'm \r\n\r\n264\r\n00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:57,533\r\njust going to browse to where I extracted that file, which is right here, which I'm trying to select.  There we go.  All right.  So, I'm going to \r\n\r\n265\r\n00:35:57,533 --> 00:36:06,399\r\npick that one file and then we can choose where to place it.  The default is on their desktop so in their desktop folder.  That's not what I want.  If \r\n\r\n266\r\n00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:14,100\r\nyou drop it down, you'll see a number of options like their home directory, the fonts folder, the system folder, but the one I want is this guy \r\n\r\n267\r\n00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:22,566\r\nright here, application folder.  If you want to specify a very particular folder, you can do specify full path down here and you can browse \r\n\r\n268\r\n00:36:22,566 --> 00:36:29,032\r\nand figure out where it is that you want it to go, but I'm going to do the applications folder because I've got the Chrome app and that's \r\n\r\n269\r\n00:36:29,033 --> 00:36:37,499\r\nwhere I want it to be.  All right.  If an item already exists, what if they already have Chrome?  Well, I need to determine whether \r\n\r\n270\r\n00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:45,733\r\nmine is newer or there's is newer.  We don't know, so it's got ask what to do.  We can choose it on our own, or you can say just go \r\n\r\n271\r\n00:36:45,733 --> 00:36:53,833\r\nahead and replace theirs or you'll see a few other ones.  I like this one.  Replace if existing item is older.  If they have an older version of \r\n\r\n272\r\n00:36:53,833 --> 00:37:01,633\r\nChrome.  Let's replace it, but if they have the same one, if it's the same age as mine, then don't bother, just skip over it, or if theirs is \r\n\r\n273\r\n00:37:01,633 --> 00:37:08,299\r\nnewer, don't downgrade them, just skip it, right.  Save us some band width.  So, that's a good option right there.  I'm going to choose that one \r\n\r\n274\r\n00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:15,266\r\nbecause I already know that client1 has Chrome.  It might be older.  It probably isn't.  It's probably the same, but I'll go ahead and just say \r\n\r\n275\r\n00:37:15,266 --> 00:37:24,266\r\nreplace if existing item is older.  All right.  We've got the ownership, you know who's going to own this.  The default is to inherit it from the \r\n\r\n276\r\n00:37:24,266 --> 00:37:29,499\r\ndestination folder.  It's rare that you want to change that, but you might be deploying something to a folder and you want to make a \r\n\r\n277\r\n00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:38,166\r\nparticular use the owner you can.  Then we see some of the same basic options, if a problem occurs stop copy on all targets.  Again, you \r\n\r\n278\r\n00:37:38,166 --> 00:37:46,032\r\nprobably don't want that.  After copying open items, if you want the program to run after it finishes copying, you might want that \r\n\r\n279\r\n00:37:46,033 --> 00:37:53,099\r\nsometimes.  I don't want that.  We'll encrypt the network data and we're pretty much ready to go.  I'm going to go ahead and hit copy, and it's \r\n\r\n280\r\n00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:59,200\r\ngoing to fire off just like that last task.  Okay?  I don't have to worry about certificates here because I'm just copying a file.  Right?  So, it's \r\n\r\n281\r\n00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:05,633\r\njust going to copy it right over, and it should happen pretty quick.  That file is not too terribly big.  Actually, you know, I didn't really pay \r\n\r\n282\r\n00:38:05,633 --> 00:38:16,099\r\nattention to the size.  It is 58.9 MB so not too terribly big.  There we go.  Just copy it over, and it's on the other side.  All right.  Now, if I look, it \r\n\r\n283\r\n00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:25,366\r\nsays that it succeeded on both of them.  I know that client1 already had Chrome, so nothing special there but if I go to client2, it didn't, and \r\n\r\n284\r\n00:38:25,366 --> 00:38:37,699\r\nnow if I go into my finder, I see that I've got Chrome right here and I can fire it up as an end user and there we go.  It's asking me if it wants \r\n\r\n285\r\n00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:46,133\r\nto become my default browser and I'll go ahead and start Chrome and now I've got it.  Right?  So, we can quickly and easily deploy files using \r\n\r\n286\r\n00:38:46,133 --> 00:38:54,733\r\nApple Remote Desktop.  The only negative is could we set the home page for Chrome?  Not really.  Right?  But we could get pretty \r\n\r\n287\r\n00:38:54,733 --> 00:39:01,133\r\nadvanced.  You could create an Automator script and push that and run it with a UNIX command.  There are few different things you can do there.  \r\n\r\n288\r\n00:39:01,133 --> 00:39:08,066\r\nThere are some some advanced functionalities in Apple Remote Desktop.  The exam doesn't dive into that.  The exam just hits these, the \r\n\r\n289\r\n00:39:08,066 --> 00:39:15,032\r\nkind of high-level ones.  So, understand that what we've seen is really cool, really cool stuff that Apple Remote Desktop can do but there is \r\n\r\n290\r\n00:39:15,033 --> 00:39:22,599\r\na lot more.  It is really, really powerful.  If you're ever bored, just poke around in the menus on it.  Like if I go back to my Apple Remote Desktop, \r\n\r\n291\r\n00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:30,700\r\nsome of the other options I didn't even look at.  When you pick a client... so, like when I go under here and I go to client1, under manage, \r\n\r\n292\r\n00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:40,333\r\nyou'll see all sorts of crazy things in here, like open applications and open items, empty trash, set the start up disk, rename the computer.  \r\n\r\n293\r\n00:39:40,333 --> 00:39:46,199\r\nRight?  Remember when I jumped over to client1 to rename it?  I could've renamed it from right here.  You can put it to sleep.  You can wake it \r\n\r\n294\r\n00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:53,733\r\nup.  You can shut it down, all these different options.  Right?  Even upgrading the client software.  Now, real quick on that, we're not \r\n\r\n295\r\n00:39:53,733 --> 00:40:00,399\r\ntalking about the host OS there.  We're not talking about Mac OS.  We're talking about the Apple Remote Desktop client.  When I look at \r\n\r\n296\r\n00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:08,700\r\nthese machines, see over here it's got ARD version?  These are all running Apple Remote Desktop 3.7.1.  That's the one that ships with \r\n\r\n297\r\n00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:17,300\r\nMavericks.  All right?  If you're still supporting Snow Leopard or Mountain Lion or any of those other older OSs, well, they might be running an \r\n\r\n298\r\n00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:26,700\r\nolder version of the Apple Remote Desktop client, so once you've added them, you can go to manage and upgrade client software and \r\n\r\n299\r\n00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:36,700\r\nwhen you go to upgrade it, it'll push out 3.7.1 to them. So, you can push that upgrade out to those machines and get it in place.  All right.  \r\n\r\n300\r\n00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:42,800\r\nSome of the other things you can do, like changing the client settings, so you can go in here and tweak some things, as far as like start \r\n\r\n301\r\n00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:49,500\r\nup and access, some of the other information.  It's just a simple wizard here as far as turning different things on.  I'm going to get out of that \r\n\r\n302\r\n00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:58,033\r\nbefore I do damage, and you'll see other things.  We didn't mess with the chat really, so under interact you have control, observe; we saw all of \r\n\r\n303\r\n00:40:58,033 --> 00:41:07,766\r\nthose, but here's send a message or chat.  Okay?  So maybe I want to send a message to client1 saying stop doing that.  Right?  And I \r\n\r\n304\r\n00:41:07,766 --> 00:41:16,432\r\ncan send that, so I'll just fire that off and if I jump over to client1, there's that message, stop doing that.  Right?  This is a noninteractive window.  \r\n\r\n305\r\n00:41:16,433 --> 00:41:27,933\r\nIt's just a message.  They get it and that's it.  If we go back up to manage, I'm sorry, interact and chat, I can say hey, how are you doing.  \r\n\r\n306\r\n00:41:27,933 --> 00:41:39,566\r\nRight?  And this is an interactive chat window and so they can type a message back and now we're exchanging information.  So maybe you \r\n\r\n307\r\n00:41:39,566 --> 00:41:46,432\r\ncan't call them on the phone.  If you're working in a computer lab, for example, you might have 50 students at computers and they don't have a \r\n\r\n308\r\n00:41:46,433 --> 00:42:00,166\r\nphone at each computer and so you might want to chat like this so you don't disturb the other students.  All right.  And notice when I close that \r\n\r\n309\r\n00:42:00,166 --> 00:42:05,866\r\nit closes it over there, too, so they're kind of linked together.  It's really, really neat stuff.  You've also got your tasks up here where you \r\n\r\n310\r\n00:42:05,866 --> 00:42:12,466\r\ncan mess with your tasks and other information.  It's really cool stuff in here.  If you ever poke around, you can find all sorts of fun things to do \r\n\r\n311\r\n00:42:12,466 --> 00:42:21,999\r\ndamage with.  [laughter]  All right, so that's the majority of what we'll see on Apple Remote Desktop, as far as the exam.  Do experiment \r\n\r\n312\r\n00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:30,666\r\naround with it, get a chance to practice.  It is $80, so if you're trying to get the certification on a shoestring budget, I have shown you all the \r\n\r\n313\r\n00:42:30,666 --> 00:42:38,099\r\ndifferent things that you need to know for the exam so you don't have to go and purchase it and run through it if you don't want to but it is a \r\n\r\n314\r\n00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:44,733\r\ngreat utility.  If you're working for a business, the odds are you can use it so it's a great thing to get to put in the budget somehow.  So, it is neat \r\n\r\n315\r\n00:42:44,733 --> 00:42:53,533\r\nsoftware.  All right?  One comment I do want to make.  If you go in the app store and start to read the reviews of Apple Remote Desktop and \r\n\r\n316\r\n00:42:53,533 --> 00:43:01,766\r\nyou read the reviews of the server app, you'll see just scathing reviews about people complaining about how horrible it is.  A lot of them, they just \r\n\r\n317\r\n00:43:01,766 --> 00:43:09,166\r\ndon't understand the management side.  You get a lot of people who just haven't taken the time to learn the software.  I will tell you it works great.  \r\n\r\n318\r\n00:43:09,166 --> 00:43:15,266\r\nI've used it in really large environments.  I've used it in small environments.  It's very stable.  It's good stuff.  You just need to make sure you \r\n\r\n319\r\n00:43:15,266 --> 00:43:21,199\r\nunderstand how it works, especially with some of the server app parts like the directory services.  You've just really got to take your time \r\n\r\n320\r\n00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:32,666\r\nand learn how it works.  All right.  So, that is Apple Remote Desktop and how we can deploy software.  It's a heck of a lot faster than \r\n\r\n321\r\n00:43:32,666 --> 00:43:40,066\r\ndeploying a full image, but we lose a little control, as far as the configurations.  So, you might find in your environment you use both.  \r\n\r\n322\r\n00:43:40,066 --> 00:43:48,632\r\nYou use a net restore image to get a basic configuration on your machines that's already set up for Apple Remote Desktop and then you \r\n\r\n323\r\n00:43:48,633 --> 00:43:56,466\r\nuse Apple Remote Desktop to manage the machines and keep them up to date and support them.  If you use the two in combination, you \r\n\r\n324\r\n00:43:56,466 --> 00:44:04,166\r\nget just a great, easy-to-manage, centrally-managed environment.  So, anybody who says Apple doesn't pay attention to business, well, \r\n\r\n325\r\n00:44:04,166 --> 00:44:10,432\r\nthey do.  Here are the tools we need right here to support ourselves in an Enterprise environment.  You combine Apple Remote \r\n\r\n326\r\n00:44:10,433 --> 00:44:17,699\r\nDesktop with the server app with a directory service, like the one included in the server app, and you've got an Enterprise class, centralized \r\n\r\n327\r\n00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:25,200\r\nmanaged network so it's really cool stuff.  You just have to deal with it.  All right.  So, that's about all I've got on Apple Remote Desktop.  \r\n\r\n328\r\n00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:31,666\r\nWe've got some great other topics coming down the line, as we move forward, but for right now, that's about it for this show so I'm going to wrap \r\n\r\n329\r\n00:44:31,666 --> 00:44:40,966\r\nit up.  Let me remind you guys, if you have any questions on this, live during the show you can go to ITPro.tv/live.

I'm your host, Don Pezet, \r\n\r\n3\r\n00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:48,466\r\nback again with another episode of Apple \r\nCertified Associate .  We're starting to kind of \r\nwind down on some of the topics, as we get \r\n\r\n4\r\n00:00:48,466 --> 00:00:56,932\r\ndown to the last few things.  The first couple of \r\nepisodes, we focused mostly on getting new \r\nsystems set up and then deploying software to \r\n\r\n5\r\n00:00:56,933 --> 00:01:04,099\r\nthem.  Now, we're going to take a look at \r\nmaintaining our system.  So, once they're in \r\nplace and everything is running happy, how do \r\n\r\n6\r\n00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:13,300\r\nwe keep them running that way?  All right?  And, \r\nyou know, one of the best ways is to stop your \r\nusers from messing with the computers.  I used \r\n\r\n7\r\n00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:20,233\r\nto make the the joke that, you know, when you \r\nset up the network, the network would be a lot \r\nmore stable if you just didn't have any users.  \r\n\r\n8\r\n00:01:20,233 --> 00:01:27,066\r\nRight?  But when you start putting users into the \r\nmix all of a sudden things just go up in flames.  \r\nYou know, you'll find, especially if you're \r\n\r\n9\r\n00:01:27,066 --> 00:01:34,032\r\nsupporting a Mac network for like a school \r\nenvironment, that your end-users ...  they get in \r\nthere and they find all sorts of new creative ways \r\n\r\n10\r\n00:01:34,033 --> 00:01:42,766\r\nto mess with your environment, so, you know, \r\nchanging wallpapers, installing software, \r\nuninstalling software, locking screens and \r\n\r\n11\r\n00:01:42,766 --> 00:01:53,866\r\nleaving it, all sorts of crazy things like that that \r\nmake your job difficult.  So to help with that in \r\nthe Mac OS server app, we have a utility that is \r\n\r\n12\r\n00:01:53,866 --> 00:02:03,499\r\ncalled the Profile Manager and what the Profile \r\nManager does is it allows us to design policies, \r\na set of of configuration values that we can push \r\n\r\n13\r\n00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:12,933\r\nout to our workstations and that way we can \r\ndictate what users are allowed to do and we can \r\nstop them from being able to change it so that \r\n\r\n14\r\n00:02:12,933 --> 00:02:18,199\r\nway you don't have to worry about people getting \r\nin there and messing around with your system, \r\nchanging their settings, and doing all sorts of \r\n\r\n15\r\n00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:27,500\r\ncrazy things.  You have complete control over it.  \r\nThe nice part about it is it's centralized, so you \r\ngo to one server, you sit down, and you write all \r\n\r\n16\r\n00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:37,500\r\nof your policies.  You put them right there in one \r\nplace and then it takes care of distributing that \r\nout to your 10 clients, 100 clients, 1000, 10,000 \r\n\r\n17\r\n00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:44,666\r\nclients, however many it is that you have, it \r\npushes it out and manages that for you, really, \r\nreally super handy.  All right, and it's all just a \r\n\r\n18\r\n00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:49,999\r\npart of the server app so if you've already done \r\nthough the $20 purchase, you've already \r\ninstalled the server app, then you've already got \r\n\r\n19\r\n00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:57,266\r\nthat functionality there.  Of the different things \r\nwe configure though, this is one that's a little bit \r\nmore involved.  A lot of the stuff that we've done \r\n\r\n20\r\n00:02:57,266 --> 00:03:05,132\r\nso far has really been pretty simple.  Right?  \r\nWhen we wanted to do NetInstall, we used the \r\nSystem Image Utility, a stand-alone utility, and \r\n\r\n21\r\n00:03:05,133 --> 00:03:10,733\r\nwe made our images and then we went into the \r\nserver app and we went into NetInstall and we \r\njust turned it on and told it where the images \r\n\r\n22\r\n00:03:10,733 --> 00:03:16,433\r\nwere.  Right?  It was really, really \r\nstraightforward.  When we did Apple Remote \r\nDesktop, we turn on management on the client \r\n\r\n23\r\n00:03:16,433 --> 00:03:25,566\r\nand then we fired up ARD on our server and we \r\njust added the clients in.  So, these things were \r\nvery, very simple.  With this one, if we want to \r\n\r\n24\r\n00:03:25,566 --> 00:03:34,932\r\nuse Profile Management, we actually have to do \r\na couple of things to get it ready.  This isn't one \r\nthat we just go in and flip the on switch on.  \r\n\r\n25\r\n00:03:34,933 --> 00:03:42,233\r\nOkay?  Well, it may be, if you've got like a super \r\ngeneric configuration, you might just be able to \r\nflip that on switch and run with it, but normally \r\n\r\n26\r\n00:03:42,233 --> 00:03:48,933\r\nthere are going to be a few other things that we \r\nneed right.  All right?  So let's talk a little bit \r\nabout the requirements for getting Profile \r\n\r\n27\r\n00:03:48,933 --> 00:03:58,966\r\nManager operational.  The first requirement is it \r\ndoes build off of the Apple Open Directory.  All \r\nright?  When you install server, you know, you've \r\n\r\n28\r\n00:03:58,966 --> 00:04:04,766\r\ngot this little advanced section down here that I \r\nknow I've been working in a bit because like \r\nNetInstall is down there but when you first \r\n\r\n29\r\n00:04:04,766 --> 00:04:12,432\r\nlaunch server it looks more like this where \r\nadvanced is kind of collapsed and if you expand \r\nthat out, you'll see down there Open Directory.  \r\n\r\n30\r\n00:04:12,433 --> 00:04:21,033\r\nIf you want to have a centralized user database, \r\nOpen Directory is a great option to do that.  You \r\ncan also use like the Microsoft Active Directory, \r\n\r\n31\r\n00:04:21,033 --> 00:04:28,033\r\nif you want to go that route or open LDAP.  \r\nThere are other solutions that are out there, but \r\nOpen Directory is perfectly good and it's \r\n\r\n32\r\n00:04:28,033 --> 00:04:35,233\r\npackaged right in the server app and it's super \r\neasy to get configured.  It is just a matter of \r\nflipping switches and doing a couple of settings.  \r\n\r\n33\r\n00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:44,233\r\nWell, Profile Manager depends on open \r\ndirectory so if you've already got one, great, \r\nyou're in business but if you don't, enabling \r\n\r\n34\r\n00:04:44,233 --> 00:04:52,199\r\nProfile Manager is also going to have to \r\nconfigure the Open Directory, too, so it'll run you \r\nthrough that wizard to get it in place.  All right?  \r\n\r\n35\r\n00:04:52,200 --> 00:05:01,000\r\nNow, Open Directory is not really on the exam, \r\nnot on this exam, at least; it is on some of the \r\nother ones, but getting it set up really isn't that \r\n\r\n36\r\n00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:10,533\r\nbig of a deal.  We go into Open Directory and \r\nwe turn it on and a little wizard runs that just \r\nasks us a few questions like what we want our \r\n\r\n37\r\n00:05:10,533 --> 00:05:20,866\r\norganization to be called and then it makes our \r\nserver an Open Directory master.  The key thing \r\nhere is that once we turn that on it enables us to \r\n\r\n38\r\n00:05:20,866 --> 00:05:31,366\r\ncreate network users.  On your system you've \r\ngot users and groups right up here and when \r\nyou look at those user accounts you've got local \r\n\r\n39\r\n00:05:31,366 --> 00:05:42,032\r\nusers.  Those are users that are on the server \r\nitself and then you've got local network users.  \r\nThese are users that are in Open Directory , all \r\n\r\n40\r\n00:05:42,033 --> 00:05:49,066\r\nright, and in order to use Profile Manager, we've \r\ngot to have user accounts in Open Directory so \r\nthat's why we need that.  We need that piece \r\n\r\n41\r\n00:05:49,066 --> 00:05:58,032\r\nand so before the show I just whipped up some \r\nuser accounts here: student1, student2, \r\nstudent3, teacher1, teacher2, and teacher3 and \r\n\r\n42\r\n00:05:58,033 --> 00:06:06,466\r\nI whipped up some groups: teachers and \r\nstudents, and groups are the same way.  You've \r\ngot local groups, which are groups right here on \r\n\r\n43\r\n00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:14,632\r\nthe server.  You can see I don't have any and \r\nthen local network groups.  These are ones in \r\nOpen Directory.  There is one created by default, \r\n\r\n44\r\n00:06:14,633 --> 00:06:23,066\r\nWorkgroup.  That's everybody.  All your users \r\nare in there by default, but then I created \r\nteachers and students.  So, that's a little bit of \r\n\r\n45\r\n00:06:23,066 --> 00:06:30,232\r\nlegwork that you'll want to get done before you \r\nstart working with Profile Managers.  You'll want \r\nto create an Open Directory environment.  All \r\n\r\n46\r\n00:06:30,233 --> 00:06:40,299\r\nright?  When you have Open Directory, you need \r\nto get your clients to bind to it, to join that \r\ndirectory.  When you tell a Mac OS client to use \r\n\r\n47\r\n00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:49,166\r\nthe centralized user database, they call that \r\nbinding.  All right?  And it's done under the share \r\nproperties of a client so if I have a new client, I \r\n\r\n48\r\n00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:59,266\r\ncan go in and I can log in and we go into our \r\nSystem Preferences and our network I mean our \r\nsharing settings so if I go into System \r\n\r\n49\r\n00:06:59,266 --> 00:07:09,699\r\nPreferences and into Sharing ...  you know what \r\nI'm sending us to the wrong place.  If we go into \r\nSystem Preferences and Users, all right, and \r\n\r\n50\r\n00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:16,400\r\nunder Users and Groups we're trying to tell it not \r\nto use just its own user database but to use a \r\nuser database that's stored in Open Directory so \r\n\r\n51\r\n00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:24,766\r\nI need to go into Users.  There we go.  And you'll \r\nsee this log in option screen.  Under log in \r\noptions that's where we can see if we're using a \r\n\r\n52\r\n00:07:24,766 --> 00:07:32,466\r\nnetwork account server and that network \r\naccount server could be Apple Open Directory, \r\nlike we're going to do in this show or it could be \r\n\r\n53\r\n00:07:32,466 --> 00:07:44,399\r\nWindows Active Directory or open LDAP, \r\nwhatever it is that you've chosen to bind to and if \r\nwe go in and update that, you can remove it and \r\n\r\n54\r\n00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:51,866\r\nyou can even add in other directory services so \r\nif there are other ones that you want to connect \r\nto you can punch them in here and see how it \r\n\r\n55\r\n00:07:51,866 --> 00:08:01,566\r\nsays Open Directory Server or Active Directory \r\nDomain so you can punch in whichever you \r\nneed.  All right.  Now, doing this, binding our \r\n\r\n56\r\n00:08:01,566 --> 00:08:09,766\r\nworkstations to Open Directory is doing two \r\nthings for us, one it's allowing them to use \r\ncentralized user accounts, which we can \r\n\r\n57\r\n00:08:09,766 --> 00:08:21,432\r\nmanage with the Profile Manager, and two, it's \r\nensuring that any SSL certificates that we issue \r\nfrom our server will be trusted by our client.  \r\n\r\n58\r\n00:08:21,433 --> 00:08:30,366\r\nNow, why do I bring that up?  Well, another \r\nrequirement of the Profile Manager is that we \r\nneed to be able to secure communications.  It \r\n\r\n59\r\n00:08:30,366 --> 00:08:38,566\r\nuses SSL for a lot of the stuff that it does so we \r\nneed to have a trusted certificate to do that.  \r\nNow you can go out and buy a certificate.  You \r\n\r\n60\r\n00:08:38,566 --> 00:08:49,099\r\ncan go to VeriSign or GeoTrust or some site like \r\nthat and usually for under $100 a year you can \r\nbuy a signed certificate that is accepted all \r\n\r\n61\r\n00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:57,566\r\nacross the planet.  All right?  Or you can just \r\ngenerate your own and that's actually the \r\ndefault.  When you install the server app, it \r\n\r\n62\r\n00:08:57,566 --> 00:09:07,299\r\nactually generates one certificate on its own.  It \r\nis called a self-signed certificate and it works \r\njust fine only no one else is going to trust that \r\n\r\n63\r\n00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:16,800\r\ncertificate other than you.  Well, when you \r\ncreate an Open Directory and you bind your \r\nclients to it part of that binding process is to \r\n\r\n64\r\n00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:24,400\r\ntrust those certificates and so because I joined \r\nthat Open Directory this client now trusts the \r\ncerts that are issued by that server.  That's a \r\n\r\n65\r\n00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:33,366\r\nkey piece.  If your certificates are not trusted, \r\nthen the Profile Manager will fail.  You'll set it up.  \r\nIt's just your profiles, your restrictions, they'll \r\n\r\n66\r\n00:09:33,366 --> 00:09:39,499\r\nnever download to the clients and it won't work.  \r\nAll right? I find that that's generally the most \r\ncommon problem that people have with setting \r\n\r\n67\r\n00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:49,000\r\nup Profile Manager is that certificate piece so \r\ndefinitely take a take a look at that.  If I go back \r\nto my server manager, here under Certificates I \r\n\r\n68\r\n00:09:49,000 --> 00:10:00,733\r\ncan see the different certificates that my system \r\nhas and I've got two.  One is called OS X \r\nserver1.local self-signed.  My server is called \r\n\r\n69\r\n00:10:00,733 --> 00:10:09,766\r\nOS X–server1 and .local just means that it's, \r\nyou know, a stand-alone machine and it's got a \r\nself-signed certificate that it generated and then \r\n\r\n70\r\n00:10:09,766 --> 00:10:19,232\r\nwhen I set up Open Directory it created a \r\nsecond certificate and you'll see it right here OS \r\nX–server1.local OD intermediate CA, all right, \r\n\r\n71\r\n00:10:19,233 --> 00:10:30,266\r\nOpen Directory Intermediate Certificate Authority \r\nso that's part of what Open Directory is using to \r\nissue out certs and when we join those other \r\n\r\n72\r\n00:10:30,266 --> 00:10:39,632\r\nclients or when we did the bind operation to get \r\nthem connected to Open Directory they now \r\ntrust that so I can use that certificate as part of \r\n\r\n73\r\n00:10:39,633 --> 00:10:48,599\r\nmy Profile Manager setup and that'll ensure I get \r\nthe secure communication.  Let's talk about \r\nsome of the other requirements that we've got.  \r\n\r\n74\r\n00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:57,500\r\nProfile Manager, it can manage, it can manage a \r\nlot of stuff, right.  I always think of it in terms of \r\nour desktop operating system, Mac OS, but it \r\n\r\n75\r\n00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:05,866\r\nwill also manage iOS.  You can manage iPads \r\nand iPhones with it.  It works great so as we \r\nstart to look at our various options, we will see \r\n\r\n76\r\n00:11:05,866 --> 00:11:15,132\r\nsome options pertain to Mac OS on the desktop \r\nand laptop, other options pertain iOS on an iPad \r\nor iPhone and yet more options pertain to both \r\n\r\n77\r\n00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:23,933\r\nso we'll see them kind of divided up as we go \r\nthrough so we can manage pretty much all of \r\nthe Apple devices except Apple TV, which you \r\n\r\n78\r\n00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:35,166\r\ncan still sort of do but not really.  All right, so the \r\nother thing is for the desktop side it's really \r\ndesigned to manage Mac OS 10.7 and higher, \r\n\r\n79\r\n00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:45,699\r\nall right, so if you've got 10.6 or earlier, well you \r\nreally need to update to 10.7 to take advantage \r\nof Profile Manager.  Prior to 10.7, we used a \r\n\r\n80\r\n00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:53,000\r\ncouple of different technologies to kind of \r\nachieve the same result so Profile Manager \r\nreplaced that old functionality so it's kind of new \r\n\r\n81\r\n00:11:53,000 --> 00:12:01,166\r\nand 10.7 is really where the support is but with \r\neach new version they've added more features \r\nso in 10.8 and now 10.9 they've added new \r\n\r\n82\r\n00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:08,466\r\nfeatures so if you want to take advantage of all \r\nof the settings everything that Profile Manager \r\nhas to offer, you should really update your \r\n\r\n83\r\n00:12:08,466 --> 00:12:16,899\r\nsystems to Mavericks.  You should get on 10.9 \r\nso that you can take advantage of all that.  If \r\nyou're running 10.8 or 10.7, it's fine, it'll work, \r\n\r\n84\r\n00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:25,500\r\nbut some of the features won't be available.  All \r\nright?  Prior to 10.7, we used what were called \r\nmanaged preferences and managed preferences \r\n\r\n85\r\n00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:33,233\r\nare still there.  If you know the old way, you can \r\nstill use the old way, but Apple has it flagged as \r\nwhat is called a deprecated feature and that \r\n\r\n86\r\n00:12:33,233 --> 00:12:41,499\r\nmeans in the near future a version of Mac OS \r\nwill come out that will no longer support it so if \r\nyou're using it today, that's fine but you need to \r\n\r\n87\r\n00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:48,600\r\nstart planning your migration away from it.  \r\nRight?  So plan your move over to Profile \r\nManager and on the exam you're only going to \r\n\r\n88\r\n00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:58,333\r\nsee Profile Manager.  You do not see managed \r\npreferences any more on the exam.  Let's see.  \r\nThat's pretty much it for the requirements.  I \r\n\r\n89\r\n00:12:58,333 --> 00:13:05,866\r\ntalked about certificates in Open Directory.  I \r\ntalked about the version of Mac OS that we \r\nneed and those different components to get \r\n\r\n90\r\n00:13:05,866 --> 00:13:14,232\r\nkinda set up and going.  All right?  Assuming \r\nyou've got all that infrastructure in place, the \r\nactual setup of Profile Manager really is'nt that \r\n\r\n91\r\n00:13:14,233 --> 00:13:20,933\r\nhard.  We basically turn it on and we have to do \r\nsome configuration settings, define a few things, \r\nand then we'll be able to get our machines \r\n\r\n92\r\n00:13:20,933 --> 00:13:27,999\r\nconnected and start to manage them.  All right?  \r\nSo, so what I've done is I've got my two clients \r\nthat I've been using in the show, client1 and \r\n\r\n93\r\n00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:37,800\r\nclient2.  It these guys that are kinda sitting here \r\nand they're joined to my Open Directory and you \r\ncan always spot a machine that's joined to the \r\n\r\n94\r\n00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:45,166\r\nOpen Directory because when they log out ...  you know normally on your login screen you just see your local user so you'd see each local \r\n\r\n95\r\n00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:54,232\r\nuser's icon.  Well, the only local user I have is helpdesk.  If I wait a second, in the background it's polling to see if a directory server's available \r\n\r\n96\r\n00:13:54,233 --> 00:14:02,766\r\nand when it finds it this little arrow appears and that'll let me switch and if you see this other bubble, that's how you know that it's connected \r\n\r\n97\r\n00:14:02,766 --> 00:14:09,266\r\nto either active directory or Open Directory and you can log in with one of those network accounts.  All right?  Now, the machine that I'm \r\n\r\n98\r\n00:14:09,266 --> 00:14:19,199\r\non, here I've got client2; here I've got client1.  I want to treat client1 as a machine that a teacher would sit at and so I'm gonna log into this one \r\n\r\n99\r\n00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:30,433\r\nas teacher1 and that user account is in my Open Directory.  That user account doesn't exist right here on this machine.  If I go into my \r\n\r\n100\r\n00:14:30,433 --> 00:14:39,666\r\nsystem preferences and I go into users and groups, I don't see teacher1 in my main users.  I see it up here as my current user and it says \r\n\r\n101\r\n00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:47,532\r\nnetwork.  That's how I know it's coming from the directory but helpdesk, that's the admin account I created and then guest user is just off not even \r\n\r\n102\r\n00:14:47,533 --> 00:14:56,266\r\nbeing used.  All right?  So I'm now logged in as teacher of this network account on this machine.  If I go over to this machine here, I'm \r\n\r\n103\r\n00:14:56,266 --> 00:15:08,432\r\ngoing to login as a student...  apparently, my mouse didn't make that transition.  All right, so I'm going to log in here as as student1 and I'll \r\n\r\n104\r\n00:15:08,433 --> 00:15:18,333\r\npunch in his password and he's going to log in.  Now, he's a network user, also, and so when he logs in on this machine it's just letting him log in \r\n\r\n105\r\n00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:26,033\r\nand he's like a normal old user and if he goes into System Preferences and into Users and Groups, I'll see student1 shows up as a network \r\n\r\n106\r\n00:15:26,033 --> 00:15:34,966\r\nuser, I've got an admin user for helpdesk, and that's it.  I don't see teacher1, teacher2, teacher3.  They exist; they're just not logged in \r\n\r\n107\r\n00:15:34,966 --> 00:15:46,832\r\nso they don't show up here.  All right, now Mac OS treats network users all the same by default so although I called it teacher1 and I called this \r\n\r\n108\r\n00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:54,533\r\none student1, it doesn't really know if they have different permissions or access or whatever so they treat them all as just regular users so \r\n\r\n109\r\n00:15:54,533 --> 00:16:01,833\r\nstudent1 can get in here and see how he's got access to all of the different system preferences, can go in and start working with \r\n\r\n110\r\n00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:10,266\r\nmission control or whatever it is that he wants to manipulate.  Now, there are some things, like if I go into Users and Groups I can't really change a \r\n\r\n111\r\n00:16:10,266 --> 00:16:19,766\r\nlot in here unless I click to make changes and when I do that it's gonna prompt me for an administrator account on this machine and the \r\n\r\n112\r\n00:16:19,766 --> 00:16:30,099\r\nstudent account isn't an administrator so if I try and punch in student1, it's not gonna work right but if I use that helpdesk account and I punch \r\n\r\n113\r\n00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:36,366\r\nthat in now I can get in and start to work.  The same thing goes for the teacher; the teacher and the student aren't treated any differently \r\n\r\n114\r\n00:16:36,366 --> 00:16:45,366\r\nright now.  Well, we can use the Profile Manager to change that.  We can use the Profile Manager to really lock down that student but \r\n\r\n115\r\n00:16:45,366 --> 00:16:51,432\r\nleave the teacher where they have greater access, the ability to control the machine however they need so we can start to have \r\n\r\n116\r\n00:16:51,433 --> 00:16:59,733\r\nthose kind of settings and the really cool part is some settings we can apply to the machine but other settings we can apply to the user so when \r\n\r\n117\r\n00:16:59,733 --> 00:17:08,099\r\na student logs in on one machine they see a certain set of things but when they log out and a teacher logs in on the same machine they can \r\n\r\n118\r\n00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:14,700\r\nget an entirely different experience, all the various settings they need access to.  That's what the Profile Manager does.  It's really cool \r\n\r\n119\r\n00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:25,133\r\nstuff.  All right, so enough talking about it.  Let's see getting it set up.  The Profile Manager is made up of a couple of different pieces.  There's \r\n\r\n120\r\n00:17:25,133 --> 00:17:34,499\r\nthe Profile Manager that we see inside of our server app, right, so we've got that Profile Manager right here.  Then it has two web-based \r\n\r\n121\r\n00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:44,933\r\ninterfaces.  It's got a web-based administration interface that admin's are going to use, and then it's got a web-based self-service portal.  The self-\r\n\r\n122\r\n00:17:44,933 --> 00:17:52,666\r\nservice portal is for your end-users.  They can log into it and they can add their machine to the Profile Manager, if they want, so if you've got a \r\n\r\n123\r\n00:17:52,666 --> 00:17:59,199\r\nbring your own device, you know a BYOD, then what people can do is they can bring their iPads from home or they can bring their MacBook Air \r\n\r\n124\r\n00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:06,366\r\nor whatever it is they have and they can log into your Profile Manager site with their network account and they can enroll their machine in \r\n\r\n125\r\n00:18:06,366 --> 00:18:14,066\r\nyour Profile Manager and when they do that you now have access.  You now have the ability to control that machine so you can push \r\n\r\n126\r\n00:18:14,066 --> 00:18:22,066\r\neducational software or whatever it is that you need to do off to those systems, all right, so kind of neat stuff.  You may or may not choose \r\n\r\n127\r\n00:18:22,066 --> 00:18:28,699\r\nto use the self-service portal.  I know a lot of people out there don't bother with it and instead just have their admin's do everything so if \r\n\r\n128\r\n00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:35,066\r\nsomebody brings their own device from home, they have to take it by the IT department and the guys at the IT department will then take it and \r\n\r\n129\r\n00:18:35,066 --> 00:18:41,132\r\nenroll it and give it back to them so there's a lot of organizations that go that way.  You may or may not choose to use the self-service portal \r\n\r\n130\r\n00:18:41,133 --> 00:18:49,166\r\nbut you will use the administration portal.  We use that all the time.  Allright, but we need to start by getting Profile Manager configured.  All \r\n\r\n131\r\n00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:57,466\r\nright, so we go into our server app and we go down to our Profile Manager and we basically flip the on switch to turn it on.  Now, it's going to \r\n\r\n132\r\n00:18:57,466 --> 00:19:06,732\r\ncheck in the background and see if I have an Open Directory already in place.  All right?  If I do, then it should activate here and be turned \r\n\r\n133\r\n00:19:06,733 --> 00:19:13,833\r\non.  All right?  If I if I don't, it will launch the Open Directory installation wizard, and we'll have to walk through a few steps and we \r\n\r\n134\r\n00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:21,433\r\nbasically just give it what our organization name is going to be, a couple of other little bits of information, and that's it.  So it's not too terribly \r\n\r\n135\r\n00:19:21,433 --> 00:19:29,199\r\ndifficult to get that Open Directory created, if you don't already have one.  All right?  In my case, I've already got an Open Directory, so it should \r\n\r\n136\r\n00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:38,666\r\nsee that and add it in.  Now, while I'm waiting on it, just a quick caveat, I do have an Open Directory but I kept it local only.  In other words, \r\n\r\n137\r\n00:19:38,666 --> 00:19:48,332\r\nmy server is OS X–server 1.local.  That's the full host name.  If I go up here to my my server name, I can see that host name right there.  \r\n\r\n138\r\n00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:56,966\r\nWhen you see .local, that's your queue that says this is a local network only; this is not going to be accessible from the Internet.  If \r\n\r\n139\r\n00:19:56,966 --> 00:20:03,166\r\nyou've got routers that are dividing your network up into subnets, this kind of, you know, lookup is not going to pass through those routers by \r\n\r\n140\r\n00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:10,299\r\ndefault so we've really kind of narrowed the scope of our system.  If you really want to get advanced, in some of the higher-end certs, we \r\n\r\n141\r\n00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:19,200\r\ncover Open Directory in more depth, but you can attach a real domain name to your server and when you do that, now it can be accessible from \r\n\r\n142\r\n00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:25,833\r\nthe Internet or accessible from other networks and you start to get a lot more power there because you can have an Open Directory that \r\n\r\n143\r\n00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:33,899\r\nspans multiple geographic locations and works even when users are at home or on the road.  With my local environment like this, when \r\n\r\n144\r\n00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:43,233\r\ncomputers are in my building, yes, they'll get their policy updates and they'll work, but when they go home, there are only certain pieces that \r\n\r\n145\r\n00:20:43,233 --> 00:20:52,166\r\nare going to work.  Some of the Profile Manager activities that we do use what are called Apple Push Notifications or APNs, where instead of \r\n\r\n146\r\n00:20:52,166 --> 00:21:00,932\r\nour server talking directly to the device our server will talk to one of Apple's servers, one of Apple's servers out there on the Internet and \r\n\r\n147\r\n00:21:00,933 --> 00:21:08,333\r\nthen your clients will periodically check in with Apple's servers.  If they're at home or at Starbucks or wherever, their machines are \r\n\r\n148\r\n00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:17,366\r\nreaching out and checking in with Apple and they'll see the messages that we leave for them.  So, for example, let's say that one of our iPads \r\n\r\n149\r\n00:21:17,366 --> 00:21:25,299\r\ngets stolen or lost, right, who knows, right, so it's just it's gone so I don't know what happened to it so I want to lock it so nobody else can use \r\n\r\n150\r\n00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:33,700\r\nit.  Well, if it's not on my network any more, how can I lock it?  So, we use an APN instead.  We generate a lock message and it sends it up to \r\n\r\n151\r\n00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:42,300\r\nApple.  Apple holds it and the next time that device checks in they'll see that lock message and they'll lock their screen, right, or we can \r\n\r\n152\r\n00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:50,433\r\nremote wipe the same way and we can erase that machine and protect it that way.  So, those types of activities are pushed through APN's and \r\n\r\n153\r\n00:21:50,433 --> 00:21:57,833\r\nthose will work even if you're set up like I am where I'm set up with a local, those will work, but if we start to do other policy changes, like \r\n\r\n154\r\n00:21:57,833 --> 00:22:05,933\r\nrestricting access to a system preference.  All right?  Those don't use APN's and so in that case the remote system won't see those \r\n\r\n155\r\n00:22:05,933 --> 00:22:13,466\r\nchanges until they come back onto your local network and they'll get it there.  All right?  We're going to see when we set these profiles up that \r\n\r\n156\r\n00:22:13,466 --> 00:22:21,632\r\nthere's really two main methods and the normal method for getting a profile applied is to do an automatic push and that's where a change \r\n\r\n157\r\n00:22:21,633 --> 00:22:29,399\r\nhappens on the server and it pushes it to the client so the client gets it and knows and it's kind of misleading the way that it says it.  It \r\n\r\n158\r\n00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:36,633\r\nsays it's a push and it really isn't.  It's not pushing the changes.  It's telling the client hey changes happened; you need to come get them, \r\n\r\n159\r\n00:22:36,633 --> 00:22:44,466\r\nand then the client comes and gets them so it's more of a notification than an actual push, although on the exam they'll call it a push.  The \r\n\r\n160\r\n00:22:44,466 --> 00:22:51,032\r\nother way is to download them.  When we create a policy, we'll have the option to download it as a file and we can just copy that file, stick it \r\n\r\n161\r\n00:22:51,033 --> 00:22:57,966\r\non a thumb drive or whatever, take it to the other machine, and install it or you can email it.  A lot of people do that.  You might be supporting a \r\n\r\n162\r\n00:22:57,966 --> 00:23:06,532\r\nlaptop that is never going to be on your network and maybe it's somebody in another country.  So, you can generate the profile here, save it to \r\n\r\n163\r\n00:23:06,533 --> 00:23:14,899\r\na file, and email it to that person and say hey run this profile and they'll run it and it'll import and now their machine will start checking in with \r\n\r\n164\r\n00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:21,766\r\nApple and you can see it.  If you've got an Internet accessible domain name up here, they can actually check in with your server and you \r\n\r\n165\r\n00:23:21,766 --> 00:23:27,566\r\ncan manage it, even though you've never actually touched the machine.  So that's some of the cool stuff that we can do with Profile \r\n\r\n166\r\n00:23:27,566 --> 00:23:36,632\r\nManager.  They probably won't hit you on the exam for things that are really advanced like that but the basic idea is that clients check in with \r\n\r\n167\r\n00:23:36,633 --> 00:23:45,633\r\nour servers, we implement restrictions, and they apply them.  All right, so mine found the Open Directory, it was happy with it, and now I'm \r\n\r\n168\r\n00:23:45,633 --> 00:23:52,799\r\nrunning.  Okay?  Now I'm not actually done.  If I go under my Profile Manager, it says it's available, it's up and running, it looks like it's \r\n\r\n169\r\n00:23:52,800 --> 00:24:02,100\r\ndone, but there's one thing I need to do.  I could stop here, if I just wanted to do the download route, where we create profiles and we download \r\n\r\n170\r\n00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:08,933\r\nthem as files and distribute them that way.  If I want to go that way, yeah, I'm done, but if I want to make use of push notifications, if I want to \r\n\r\n171\r\n00:24:08,933 --> 00:24:18,633\r\nmake use of that, then I need to configure Device Management.  Okay?  The Device Management... it's really the key component \r\n\r\n172\r\n00:24:18,633 --> 00:24:25,966\r\nhere to be able automatically update these machines and get them going so we're almost always going to want that.  You don't technically \r\n\r\n173\r\n00:24:25,966 --> 00:24:35,066\r\nhave to have it, though, if you just want that basic functionality.  To use MDM... MDM is the Mobile Device Manager and that's what's kind of \r\n\r\n174\r\n00:24:35,066 --> 00:24:41,932\r\nthe underlying technology here but if we want to use this Device Management that it's talking about, this is where we have to have valid \r\n\r\n175\r\n00:24:41,933 --> 00:24:50,366\r\ncertificates on our system so you've got to have SSL certs to be able to work.  If you've got self-signed certificates like this and you have the \r\n\r\n176\r\n00:24:50,366 --> 00:24:57,099\r\nOpen Directory and the clients are bound to your Open Directory, then your search situation is taken care.  All right?  But if you're going to \r\n\r\n177\r\n00:24:57,100 --> 00:25:04,433\r\nbe managing the profile of machines that are not joined to your Open Directory, well in that scenario you might have self-signed certificates \r\n\r\n178\r\n00:25:04,433 --> 00:25:11,833\r\nthat they don't trust and so you'll have to go through the process of exporting your public key and importing it on those clients to trust it there.  \r\n\r\n179\r\n00:25:11,833 --> 00:25:19,466\r\nSo there are ways around that.  All right, but I'm going to go over here and choose configure to get the device management set up, and this \r\n\r\n180\r\n00:25:19,466 --> 00:25:25,299\r\nwizard is pretty straightforward.  It's not that bad.  Basically, we're just going to run through and answer a few little questions here.  The \r\n\r\n181\r\n00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:34,233\r\nremote users when they're being asked if we want to manage them or if they want to let us manage them, they'll see this information \r\n\r\n182\r\n00:25:34,233 --> 00:25:39,999\r\ndescribing our network and so we have to tell them a little bit about us in case, you know, we have a problem so you'll normally just put in \r\n\r\n183\r\n00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:46,700\r\nyour company name, your email address, you know, maybe put in your phone number so that they can call if they have any questions and \r\n\r\n184\r\n00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:54,300\r\nyour mailing address, that kind of stuff.  So, you just kinda throw it in here and this is just what they'll see on the screen so that they can, you \r\n\r\n185\r\n00:25:54,300 --> 00:26:04,900\r\nknow, determine whether or not this is actually the right organization they want to be managed by.  All right, then the certificate, okay, you've \r\n\r\n186\r\n00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:11,166\r\ngot to pick a certificate here or the Device Management part won't work and, you know, so I could choose none and that's not going work \r\n\r\n187\r\n00:26:11,166 --> 00:26:19,566\r\nout well for me.  Now, if I choose either of these other two certs, see the warning I get?  This certificate isn't signed by a Trusted Certificate \r\n\r\n188\r\n00:26:19,566 --> 00:26:29,299\r\nAuthority.  We made it ourselves.  Right?  It wasn't issued by GeoTrust or VeriSign or Thawte or something like that.  It was issued by us, Joe \r\n\r\n189\r\n00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:36,833\r\nSchmoe, some guy the rest of the Internet hasn't even heard of.  All right?  So, it's warning us that in order for this to work whatever clients \r\n\r\n190\r\n00:26:36,833 --> 00:26:42,466\r\nwe manage have to trust our certificate.  All right?  And there are a couple of different ways we can go about making that happen.  I'll show \r\n\r\n191\r\n00:26:42,466 --> 00:26:49,032\r\nyou some probably in the second segment.  We will take a look at that, but for right now I'm going to go with that Open Directory certificate.  \r\n\r\n192\r\n00:26:49,033 --> 00:26:58,933\r\nThat's the one I want to use, and I'll hit next.  Now, if we're going to be using Apple servers, the servers at Apple headquarters, right?  Well, \r\n\r\n193\r\n00:26:58,933 --> 00:27:07,066\r\nwe're going to have to have an Apple ID to do it.  All right?  Apple recommends that you don't use your regular Apple ID, so if you've already got \r\n\r\n194\r\n00:27:07,066 --> 00:27:13,832\r\none in your iPhone, you know, you want to protect you Angry Bird scores so you don't want top use that one.  Create a new one.  Create \r\n\r\n195\r\n00:27:13,833 --> 00:27:23,133\r\none dedicated just for this purpose right here, just for the APN's.  All right?  If you create one, or not if, you're going to.  When you create one \r\n\r\n196\r\n00:27:23,133 --> 00:27:30,499\r\nand you hit next, it is going to register your server with Apple and generate another set of certificates.  These will be certificates that are \r\n\r\n197\r\n00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:35,800\r\nstored at Apple and used for communicating with their server, so there will actually be a whole separate set of certificates generated \r\n\r\n198\r\n00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:42,633\r\nhere.  Now, this is an area that has been pretty problematic for a lot of people.  I've talked to people setting this up and and they've had \r\n\r\n199\r\n00:27:42,633 --> 00:27:55,699\r\nissues and what happens is if you just created a new account, part of the process of creating a new Apple ID is to verify your email address and \r\n\r\n200\r\n00:27:55,700 --> 00:28:04,533\r\nthen verify the account.  It's like a two-step authorization process.  If you haven't completed both steps, then this is going to fail right here \r\n\r\n201\r\n00:28:04,533 --> 00:28:11,733\r\nand the error message ...  it's something like error 500 or something.  It is not informative at all, so you don't really know why it failed but it's \r\n\r\n202\r\n00:28:11,733 --> 00:28:19,599\r\nalmost always that you either didn't complete any or you only completed one of the two verification steps so make sure if you just \r\n\r\n203\r\n00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:26,800\r\ncreated a new email ...  a new Apple ID, check your email.  Check your spam folder.  Make sure that you got both, the two verification \r\n\r\n204\r\n00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:35,433\r\nemails that you verified both of them.  So, I'm going to punch in that password.  I know I verified both so this should work just fine.  See \r\n\r\n205\r\n00:28:35,433 --> 00:28:43,933\r\ndown here... acquiring push certificate.  We're reaching out to Apple, telling them hey, we want to do pushes and we want to use your server to \r\n\r\n206\r\n00:28:43,933 --> 00:28:52,166\r\ndo it, and Apple is going to say all right, sure, and will give you some certificate.  All right?  Now, Apple servers, they get pretty busy, and I \r\n\r\n207\r\n00:28:52,166 --> 00:29:01,899\r\nwould say it worked for me here but I would say I have a 50/50 chance of it working the first time.  About half the time I get this that fails and it will \r\n\r\n208\r\n00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:09,133\r\nsay something like server unreachable and that just means the Apple servers were busy.  If that happens, you just hit next to try again and it'll \r\n\r\n209\r\n00:29:09,133 --> 00:29:16,966\r\ntry and it almost always works the second time so it's a really busy point you might see that out there in real life land.  I got lucky this time and it \r\n\r\n210\r\n00:29:16,966 --> 00:29:27,499\r\nworked on the first try.  All right.  I'll go ahead and hit finish.  It's now updating the SSL information and now I'm basically set up.  Notice \r\n\r\n211\r\n00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:34,766\r\ndevice management says enabled, and now I'm ready to rock.  All right?  There are some other little features in here that we might want to turn \r\n\r\n212\r\n00:29:34,766 --> 00:29:43,832\r\non or off.  You know, you see there's not a whole lot we configure from this screen.  We'll see things like enrolling devices using the Device \r\n\r\n213\r\n00:29:43,833 --> 00:29:52,766\r\nEnrollment program, distribute apps and books from the Volume Purchase Program and so on.  If you're a part of some of the really big \r\n\r\n214\r\n00:29:52,766 --> 00:30:00,399\r\nenterprise account services with Apple, there are some neat stuff you can do.  For example, you know, I was talking about how our users will \r\n\r\n215\r\n00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:07,000\r\nneed to enroll their system to be managed by us, so they actually have to browse to a website and choose to enroll in order for us to manage \r\n\r\n216\r\n00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:15,833\r\nthem or we have to do it for them.  Right?  Well, if you buy thousands of computers from Apple you don't want to have to do that 1000 times so \r\n\r\n217\r\n00:30:15,833 --> 00:30:24,799\r\nwhat you can do is if you join their Device Enrollment Program, they, when you purchase equipment, they can send you a list of the serial \r\n\r\n218\r\n00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:32,266\r\nnumbers for the equipment you purchase before you even get it and you can load those serial numbers here into your Profile Manager and \r\n\r\n219\r\n00:30:32,266 --> 00:30:39,999\r\nthen when those machines show up they'll already be enrolled.  They'll already be ready to jump right in based on that serial number.  \r\n\r\n220\r\n00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:46,533\r\nOkay?  But, you've got to be a part of that Device Enrollment Program.  If you're a small network like ours here, obviously you're not \r\n\r\n221\r\n00:30:46,533 --> 00:30:52,166\r\ngoing to be a part of that so I don't have one so I'm not going to use that.  The same thing with Volume Purchase Program.  If you're a school \r\n\r\n222\r\n00:30:52,166 --> 00:31:01,432\r\nand you want to buy an app from the App Store for all 5000 of your students, well, you don't want all of your student to have to log in and buy \r\n\r\n223\r\n00:31:01,433 --> 00:31:09,933\r\nthe app, so you can do a volume purchase and you can buy 5000 copies of that app and then you can use the Profile Manager to distribute it, \r\n\r\n224\r\n00:31:09,933 --> 00:31:18,233\r\napps and books.  Right?  Great for textbooks.  So, we can buy it and then we can distribute it out to the clients, once they've signed up to be \r\n\r\n225\r\n00:31:18,233 --> 00:31:26,166\r\nmanaged by our Profile Manager.  All right?  I don't have Volume Purchase Program, so I won't do that one either.  All right.  The last two \r\n\r\n226\r\n00:31:26,166 --> 00:31:34,966\r\noptions ... This next one is default configuration profile settings for everyone.  All right?  When we create profiles, a lot of our profiles are going \r\n\r\n227\r\n00:31:34,966 --> 00:31:45,466\r\nto be customized to individual users or groups or computers, but there's one special profile that's called everyoneand it applies to, well, everyone.  \r\n\r\n228\r\n00:31:45,466 --> 00:31:55,232\r\nSo, that's turned on by default and you can configure it so that if you've got other services on your server, like calendar, contacts, mail, \r\n\r\n229\r\n00:31:55,233 --> 00:32:03,966\r\nmessages, you can change that everyone profile to automatically connect to this server for calendar, contacts, mail, and messages, so \r\n\r\n230\r\n00:32:03,966 --> 00:32:11,532\r\ninstead of having to set up those clients, they're already set up.  The user logs into the computer for the first time, and the messages client is \r\n\r\n231\r\n00:32:11,533 --> 00:32:18,199\r\nalready waiting with their buddy list loaded.  They fire up the mail app, and it's already got their email account added.  They fire up their \r\n\r\n232\r\n00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:25,400\r\ncalendar and contacts, and there's all their people and notices.  It's all already there.  All right.  Really cool stuff, if it's all run from this \r\n\r\n233\r\n00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:33,233\r\nserver.  If it's being run from other servers, though, you don't want that, so the default is it's turned off but if we want it, we can go in here \r\n\r\n234\r\n00:32:33,233 --> 00:32:41,166\r\nand we can choose to include configuration for services and you can see mine is adding those services that I configured.  If I wasn't running \r\n\r\n235\r\n00:32:41,166 --> 00:32:47,566\r\nthose.  If I wasn't running mail or or calendar or messaging, then these icons wouldn't show up here so it only shows the ones that you've \r\n\r\n236\r\n00:32:47,566 --> 00:32:59,166\r\nactually configured.  All right, and then the last option on this screen is to sign configuration profiles.  When we push these profiles out, it's \r\n\r\n237\r\n00:32:59,166 --> 00:33:08,032\r\npossible that an attacker could get a hold of one, change settings inside of it, and then send it along to a destination, and they could set their \r\n\r\n238\r\n00:33:08,033 --> 00:33:17,499\r\nsystem up to be managed by the attacker by accident.  You wouldn't want that, so we can digitally sign those using a certificate and I'll see \r\n\r\n239\r\n00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:24,633\r\nthat same certificate right there, I can pick it, I'm going to go ahead and say okay to that, and now every time I send out a profile, it'll be \r\n\r\n240\r\n00:33:24,633 --> 00:33:31,999\r\ndigitally signed with my certificate.  Now, if somebody doesn't trust my certificate, it's not going to work, but I already said that we need to \r\n\r\n241\r\n00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:41,466\r\nhave people trust our certificates so we'll see that in a minute.  All right, with that, now I'm actually done.  Now the Profile Manager is up \r\n\r\n242\r\n00:33:41,466 --> 00:33:49,832\r\nand running and it's ready to have clients join to it, but I've got a lot more work.  Right?  The two things that I need to do still, one, I need to get \r\n\r\n243\r\n00:33:49,833 --> 00:33:55,933\r\nmy clients connected so I need to get those workstations where I can manage them, and, two, I need to set up my policies.  I need to set \r\n\r\n244\r\n00:33:55,933 --> 00:34:02,466\r\nup the restrictions and other types of access that have the apps I want to distribute, that kind of thing.  I need to set all that stuff up yet, and I \r\n\r\n245\r\n00:34:02,466 --> 00:34:09,966\r\nhaven't done it, yet.  All right?  But, I'm kind of out of time on this segment.  So, it's a good spot for us to stop and take a break. and when \r\n\r\n246\r\n00:34:09,966 --> 00:34:16,766\r\nwe get back I'll get a chance to show you guys joining those clients and then we'll start to set up some actual profiles.  So it will be fun so \r\n\r\n247\r\n00:34:16,766 --> 00:34:19,966\r\nstay tuned.  We'll be back after this.  \r\n\r\n248\r\n00:34:19,966 --> 00:34:27,932\r\n(MUSIC)  \r\n\r\n249\r\n00:34:27,933 --> 00:34:37,299\r\nAll right, welcome back everybody.  Okay, so what I want to take a look at next is the process of getting some machines enrolled.  All right?  If \r\n\r\n250\r\n00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:45,266\r\nyou want a machine to participate in your Profile Manager environment, it's gotta be enrolled and there's really, I don't know, there's maybe three \r\n\r\n251\r\n00:34:45,266 --> 00:34:52,799\r\nways that we can do this.  Right?  The first way is the manual way and it is honestly the way that most people do it ...  is that an IT person \r\n\r\n252\r\n00:34:52,800 --> 00:35:00,800\r\ngets that system ready and as part of getting that system ready they manually enroll it with the Profile Manager.  All right?  A second way is \r\n\r\n253\r\n00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:06,733\r\nto use that Device Enrollment Program from Apple where they've already enrolled it for you and by the time you get you just have to punch \r\n\r\n254\r\n00:35:06,733 --> 00:35:14,999\r\nin the serial numbers and you're in business.  The third method is kind of a hybrid between the two and that's where we pre-stage the machine \r\n\r\n255\r\n00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:23,066\r\nin the Profile Manager by putting in the serial number, but then someone still has to go to that other machine to to get it enrolled and I know \r\n\r\n256\r\n00:35:23,066 --> 00:35:28,966\r\nyou're probably saying well, why would you even bother doing that.  There is one reason but I haven't gotten to it, yet, so we'll wait and talk \r\n\r\n257\r\n00:35:28,966 --> 00:35:37,366\r\nabout that a little bit later.  It has to do with with what device groups that things fall into, so we'll see that in a minute.  So, let's take a look at an \r\n\r\n258\r\n00:35:37,366 --> 00:35:46,099\r\nexample of manual enrollment.  I want to manually enroll a system onto my server.  All right?  So, what I do is I go the client and on the \r\n\r\n259\r\n00:35:46,100 --> 00:36:03,300\r\nclient I just fire up a web browser and I browse to my server, so I'm going to put in https://osx–server1.local/profilemanager.  All right.\r\n\r\n260\r\n00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:10,300\r\nOr, if the web server is turned on, you can leave the profilemanager part off and you'll see a \rlittle icon. I can't remember if my ... let's see if \r\n\r\n261\r\n00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:17,033\r\nmine is tunred on.  If I just browse to the server ... yeah, mine's turned off.  All right.  If it's turned off, you won't see it, so we'll have to actually \r\n\r\n262\r\n00:36:17,033 --> 00:36:26,899\r\ntype in Profile Manager.  All right.  So, I'll punch that in and I should get this screen right here.  Now, you might get a warning about your \r\n\r\n263\r\n00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:33,333\r\ncertificate not being trusted.  Remember, you know, by joining an open directory it kind of solves that problem, but if you don't have that, \r\n\r\n264\r\n00:36:33,333 --> 00:36:39,499\r\nthen you may get a warning about it not being trusted and in that warning you can choose to trust the certificate, if you want, right there.  \r\n\r\n265\r\n00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:48,000\r\nThat works for the user.  It doesn't work for the computer, though, so really if you're going to be dealing with that self-signed certificate and not \r\n\r\n266\r\n00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:56,700\r\nmaintaining an Open Directory, you'll need to manually import that certificate in.  All right.  So, I'm going to log in here.  Now, by default in \r\n\r\n267\r\n00:36:56,700 --> 00:37:04,433\r\nProfile Manager any user that has an Open Directory account can enroll machines in the Profile Manager.  You may not want that.  You \r\n\r\n268\r\n00:37:04,433 --> 00:37:12,933\r\nmay want just your IT department to be able to do that, so I'll show you how to override that behavior later but for right now anybody ...  I \r\n\r\n269\r\n00:37:12,933 --> 00:37:20,599\r\ncould log in with any valid Open Directory account and I'll be able to register so if I want to do this is as teacher1, I'm going to log in here \r\n\r\n270\r\n00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:33,300\r\nas teacher1 and ...  apparently, I typed in my password wrong so let me try that again ...  and what I should see ...  there we go ...  is this \r\n\r\n271\r\n00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:40,266\r\nscreen right here, the enrollment screen.  All right?  On the enrollment screen, I've got that big blue button right there where I can enroll with \r\n\r\n272\r\n00:37:40,266 --> 00:37:51,099\r\nthis Profile Manager.  All right?  Now, on the certificate side, if we still don't have a trusted certificate, before we enroll it's a good idea to go \r\n\r\n273\r\n00:37:51,100 --> 00:38:00,200\r\nto this profiles tab and you'll see under here trust profile for ITProTV lab.  Right?  Obviously, you won't see ITProTV lab.  You'll see whatever \r\n\r\n274\r\n00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:08,533\r\nyour Open Directory organization name is.  All right?  This is the trust profile.  It contains the certificate for the server.  Right?  That certificate \r\n\r\n275\r\n00:38:08,533 --> 00:38:16,433\r\nthat I said was so important, if you hit show contents here, you'll see it contains that certificate, so if I choose to install that, that's \r\n\r\n276\r\n00:38:16,433 --> 00:38:23,599\r\ngoing to solve my certificate issue, also.  This is another way to get that taken care of, so here it's going to install it and I can just hit continue \r\n\r\n277\r\n00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:34,500\r\nand it's going to say are you sure you want to install this profile, this certificate profile, and I'll say go ahead and now I've got to put in an \r\n\r\n278\r\n00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:42,833\r\nadministrator's password.  Any user can use the enrollment wizard, but when it comes to actually doing the enrollment, actually getting this \r\n\r\n279\r\n00:38:42,833 --> 00:38:49,399\r\nworkstation bound over, they need to have a local administrator account.  In my case, I'm logged in as a student ...  or teacher.  I'm logged \r\n\r\n280\r\n00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:59,033\r\nin as a teacher, and I don't have administrative access on this machine so I have to provide somebody who does so I'll provide helpdesk.  All \r\n\r\n281\r\n00:38:59,033 --> 00:39:06,166\r\nright.  There we go, and I can see that I've got two settings and the settings are certificates.  One of them is the self-signed certificate for the \r\n\r\n282\r\n00:39:06,166 --> 00:39:13,266\r\nserver.  The other one is the Open Directory certificate, so I've got both of those now.  Now, I'll trust those certificates, and I'll be happy.  All \r\n\r\n283\r\n00:39:13,266 --> 00:39:20,099\r\nright?  So, I didn't have to do that here.  I went ahead and did it just because I wanted to show you guys but because I've got the Open \r\n\r\n284\r\n00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:28,000\r\nDirectory in place, I could've skipped that step and just gone straight to the enroll button.  So, now I'm going to go ahead and hit enroll, and \r\n\r\n285\r\n00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:35,900\r\nwhen you go to enroll, notice it just downloaded another profile.  This is the remote management profile.  This is what's actually going to connect \r\n\r\n286\r\n00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:47,300\r\nus to the Profile Manager.  I'll go haead and hit continue and install and that's gonna bring that one in and I'll provide that administrative account \r\n\r\n287\r\n00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:59,366\r\nand it'll install it.  The second, this one, this second profile, it just brought in certificates, but the remote management one brings in the MDM, \r\n\r\n288\r\n00:39:59,366 --> 00:40:07,866\r\nthe Mobile Device Management, as well as the SCEP enrollment request so more of our certificate enrollment to be able to communicate \r\n\r\n289\r\n00:40:07,866 --> 00:40:16,699\r\nbetween our server securely.  All right.  With those things taken care of, this client is now being managed by the Profile Manager.  Now, \r\n\r\n290\r\n00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:23,133\r\nwe haven't changed any settings, yet, so we're not going to see anything different.  As an end-user, there's not really much that's different at \r\n\r\n291\r\n00:40:23,133 --> 00:40:31,299\r\nall.  In fact, the only real difference you see by default is in System Preferences.  There's a new little icon down at the bottom of the screen, if \r\n\r\n292\r\n00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:42,133\r\nyou can see it, right there, called Profiles, but other than that, there is no no difference on the system by default until we start tweaking things.  \r\n\r\n293\r\n00:40:42,133 --> 00:40:52,633\r\nAll right.  Now, I'm not going to enroll my other client just yet.  I'll enroll it here in a moment, but this one is now enrolled and ready to be \r\n\r\n294\r\n00:40:52,633 --> 00:41:00,399\r\nmanaged.  Okay.  Now, when it comes time to actually managing, I'm going to create profiles that will determine certain settings on my \r\n\r\n295\r\n00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:10,166\r\nsystem, and I can do that based on the computer, based on the user, based on groups the user's in, based on all sorts of different \r\n\r\n296\r\n00:41:10,166 --> 00:41:19,299\r\nthings so I've got a lot of power when it comes actually implementing those restrictions.  Okay?  So, at this point, it's managed.  There's not \r\n\r\n297\r\n00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:27,000\r\nmuch else to do here on the client, might as well go check out things on the on the server.  Now, when I browsed to this website, when I \r\n\r\n298\r\n00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:37,600\r\nwent to OS X–server 1.local/Profile Manager, it took me to this page called the My Devices page.  The My Devices page is where a regular \r\n\r\n299\r\n00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:46,200\r\nuser is going to be directed.  If I had logged in as an administrator, though, I would've been given the Profile Management page, which is \r\n\r\n300\r\n00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:54,166\r\ndifferent.  It's got a lot more stuff on it.  All right?  And then you'll have a little button you can hit to flip to this My Devices page, if you want, so \r\n\r\n301\r\n00:41:54,166 --> 00:42:01,299\r\nadministrators have a very different experience when they come to this page.  I'm going to go back to my server and here on my server it's got \r\n\r\n302\r\n00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:09,866\r\na link down here that says open Profile Manager, but really all it's doing is browsing to that same URL and you're just logging in with an \r\n\r\n303\r\n00:42:09,866 --> 00:42:16,899\r\nadmin.  That's all it's doing.  These two links, see this link up here where it says profiles are available to all users for download and devices \r\n\r\n304\r\n00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:23,400\r\ncan be enrolled for management.  Visit the user portal, and here's a link, and then open Profile Manager and here's a link.  They actually go to \r\n\r\n305\r\n00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:31,133\r\nthe exact same place.  It's your credential that determines what you see.  So, I'm going to go in here, and you can see that URL right there \r\n\r\n306\r\n00:42:31,133 --> 00:42:40,266\r\n/Profile Manager, same place, but I'm going to log in as my helpdesk account and that's my administrator so I'm going to come in here and \r\n\r\n307\r\n00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:50,999\r\nget logged in and notice the screen that I see here ...  it's a good bit different than that screen I got a moment ago.  Now, it doesn't mean I can't \r\n\r\n308\r\n00:42:51,000 --> 00:43:00,000\r\nget to that screen.  Up at the top right see here where it says helpdesk.  If I drop that down, I can choose go to My Devices, and if I hit that, \r\n\r\n309\r\n00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:09,366\r\nnow I'll see the My Devices screen just like the end-users do.  Okay.  Now, why would I want to come here?  Well, I'm on the server.  The server \r\n\r\n310\r\n00:43:09,366 --> 00:43:17,566\r\nisn't necessarily enrolled by default in Profile Manager.  If I want to manage the server itself, I might want to enroll it.  All right?  Or you might \r\n\r\n311\r\n00:43:17,566 --> 00:43:24,099\r\nnot, because there is the possibility you could lock yourself out of the system or create a situation where you couldn't, you know, couldn't \r\n\r\n312\r\n00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:31,966\r\noperate as a true administrator, so I usually tend not to manage my server this way.  All right?  But I can just go right back here and I'm back in \r\n\r\n313\r\n00:43:31,966 --> 00:43:41,032\r\nmy Profile Manager.  Now, I haven't customized anything in here.  All right?  This is all the default, but it pulls some information from our \r\n\r\n314\r\n00:43:41,033 --> 00:43:48,733\r\nOpen Directory.  So, even though I haven't configured anything, when I go to groups I already see a handful of groups.  All right?  I see \r\n\r\n315\r\n00:43:48,733 --> 00:43:57,166\r\nstudents and teachers because I created those in Open Directory earlier.  It imports these from Open Directory.  Notice there's no plus sign \r\n\r\n316\r\n00:43:57,166 --> 00:44:07,332\r\ndown here.  You can't add user groups inside of the Profile Manager.  If I want to add more groups, I've gotta go over to my Server Manager \r\n\r\n317\r\n00:44:07,333 --> 00:44:15,433\r\nand do it in Open Directory, so, like, if I go back here to Server Manager and go to Groups I can create a new group here so maybe I'll call it \r\n\r\n318\r\n00:44:15,433 --> 00:44:26,833\r\nNetwork Admins.  All right.  So, I just created a Network Admins group.  Now, quick note, I was already on the local Network Groups.  It's really \r\n\r\n319\r\n00:44:26,833 --> 00:44:34,799\r\nimportant that you be there.  Those are the ones that get created in Open Directory.  If I had been on Local Groups, the group I create won't show \r\n\r\n320\r\n00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:43,466\r\nup in the Profile Manager.  It's not suitable for that, so make sure that you're on the Network Group side of things.  So, now that I've created \r\n\r\n321\r\n00:44:43,466 --> 00:44:52,232\r\nthat group, if I go back to my Profile Manager, I can see it's already shown up.  It shows up pretty fast.  Right?  It's coming from the Open \r\n\r\n322\r\n00:44:52,233 --> 00:45:01,066\r\nDirectory.  That's where it's pulling this information from.  The only one that it creates that isn't in Open Directory is this guy right here, \r\n\r\n323\r\n00:45:01,066 --> 00:45:09,366\r\nEveryone.  Remember I mentioned that default profile that applies to everybody.  This is it, the Everyone, and when it was mentioned on that \r\n\r\n324\r\n00:45:09,366 --> 00:45:16,499\r\nother screen ... It said settings for everyone, what it was talking about was going here to Groups, going to Everyone, and clicking on this\r\n\r\n325\r\n00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:24,166\r\nsettings tab right here.  That is settings for Everyone, and what did I tell settings for Everyone to do?  I said go ahead and set us up \r\n\r\n326\r\n00:45:24,166 --> 00:45:31,899\r\nfor our mail client, messages, and all that other good stuff, and I can see that right here, mail, calendar, contacts, messages.  I'm running \r\n\r\n327\r\n00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:39,300\r\nthose services on my server, so they're automatically going to be added to Everyone who gets managed by my Profile Manager, so \r\n\r\n328\r\n00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:48,066\r\nthat's going to be done automatically.  Now, there are a lot of other options in here.  On this screen, there are two main things I want to pay \r\n\r\n329\r\n00:45:48,066 --> 00:45:55,799\r\nattention to and that's these buttons right here.  All right?  Download, if you have a remote client who can't get to your website, if you don't have a \r\n\r\n330\r\n00:45:55,800 --> 00:46:05,633\r\npublic website for managing the Profile Manager, and they can't get to it, you can hit download and it will download this profile as as a file.  I'm \r\n\r\n331\r\n00:46:05,633 --> 00:46:14,233\r\ngoing to cancel it.  I don't want to actually run it.  Let me go into my downloads file here and I'll show you.  It's a little file right here, settings for \r\n\r\n332\r\n00:46:14,233 --> 00:46:23,633\r\neveryone.mobile config.  All right.  It's 8K in size, very small.  It's just a little file, and I can take that file and stick it in an email and send it to \r\n\r\n333\r\n00:46:23,633 --> 00:46:30,366\r\nthat person and they just have to double click on it and it will install and now they'll be managed by us and they'll reach out to Apple's servers \r\n\r\n334\r\n00:46:30,366 --> 00:46:37,032\r\nand we'll communicate with them through Apple's servers.  All right?  So, downloading is one method to be able to get this configuration \r\n\r\n335\r\n00:46:37,033 --> 00:46:45,633\r\nover to somebody who's not local on our network.  The other option is edit, and that's where we can go in to edit these settings or you \r\n\r\n336\r\n00:46:45,633 --> 00:46:52,866\r\ncould just click on the setting itself, like if I click on general, there we go, it'll take me in there and I can start to mess with those settings.  All \r\n\r\n337\r\n00:46:52,866 --> 00:46:58,699\r\nright?  You know, there are all these different icons.  It doesn't really matter which one you click on, like if I click on mail, it's going to take \r\n\r\n338\r\n00:46:58,700 --> 00:47:06,733\r\nme in there straight to the mail setting but there's general right there so it's just taking you right to that place.  In here is where I actually \r\n\r\n339\r\n00:47:06,733 --> 00:47:15,766\r\ncreate my profile.  These are where I add and take away things from my users to create the experience that I want.  Be very careful with this \r\n\r\n340\r\n00:47:15,766 --> 00:47:25,466\r\none.  This is the Everyone profile.  This applies to everybody, so whatever you do in here, it's affecting students, teachers, administrators, \r\n\r\n341\r\n00:47:25,466 --> 00:47:35,366\r\neveryone.  There are no exceptions to the Everyone group, so we normally keep this very, very small, very basic, things like getting set up \r\n\r\n342\r\n00:47:35,366 --> 00:47:42,232\r\nto our mail server.  Right, that's going to be the same for everybody.  Other things might be like our passcode configuration.  We might want to \r\n\r\n343\r\n00:47:42,233 --> 00:47:51,766\r\nrequire everyone in our company to change their password every 60 days, so I might come in here and say maximum passcode age 60.  All \r\n\r\n344\r\n00:47:51,766 --> 00:48:00,266\r\nright?  So, I'm making that change and getting that put in place.  So, we go through and we customize the things to be the way that we want \r\n\r\n345\r\n00:48:00,266 --> 00:48:11,199\r\nthem to be.  You'll see a lot of settings in here.  The stuff that I see the very beginning ...  see how it says OS10 and iOS?  It says both.  I can \r\n\r\n346\r\n00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:21,766\r\nmanage both my OS X stuff and my iOS stuff with these settings, but not every setting is universal like that.   If I scroll down, I'll see a \r\n\r\n347\r\n00:48:21,766 --> 00:48:31,866\r\nsection called iOS, so these are settings that will just apply on iPhone, iPad, and sometimes Apple TV.  All right?  And then if I keep scrolling \r\n\r\n348\r\n00:48:31,866 --> 00:48:40,866\r\ndown, now I see OS X.  These are settings that apply just on the Mac OS desktop or, you know, PC and laptop so I can see those settings down \r\n\r\n349\r\n00:48:40,866 --> 00:48:48,066\r\nhere.  You'll see some overlap between the two, but they're just settings that are applied differently.  So, be aware that you might have to \r\n\r\n350\r\n00:48:48,066 --> 00:48:57,066\r\nscroll down to find the settings that you're looking for, but seeing as this is a settings for everyone profile I won't normally mess around \r\n\r\n351\r\n00:48:57,066 --> 00:49:03,566\r\nwith settings that are specific to hardware.  I'll kind of keep it high level, and. typically, things like a password policy are the only things I'll \r\n\r\n352\r\n00:49:03,566 --> 00:49:11,166\r\nmess with here.  All right.  When you make a change, you've got a little okay button down here at the bottom.  If you change your mind \r\n\r\n353\r\n00:49:11,166 --> 00:49:17,732\r\nand decide you don't want to make a change, you've got a little minus button up here and you can undo it.  Notice how it says passcode not \r\n\r\n354\r\n00:49:17,733 --> 00:49:28,266\r\nconfigured, and if I hit configure and I enter in a value, now it says one payload configured.  That's how I know that I made a change and that \r\n\r\n355\r\n00:49:28,266 --> 00:49:36,966\r\nI'm in there and configuring things, so I can see some of the different settings and values and stuff like that.  All right?  That one payload, that \r\n\r\n356\r\n00:49:36,966 --> 00:49:43,766\r\ndoesn't mean I only changed one setting.  See how I just changed three things and it still says one payload?  That just means that this is a part \r\n\r\n357\r\n00:49:43,766 --> 00:49:52,966\r\nof the overall policy, so I've got another payload down here and another there so I can tweak these however I need and then I can hit okay.  \r\n\r\n358\r\n00:49:52,966 --> 00:50:01,966\r\nAll right.  Now, you'll be tempted, and I'm sure I will do this before the show ends, to just go and click and start working on the next thing, but \r\n\r\n359\r\n00:50:01,966 --> 00:50:10,499\r\nthere is actually a save button.  Let me resize this.  There you go.  You see that save button right there?  So, you do need to save your \r\n\r\n360\r\n00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:18,233\r\nprofiles when you modify them, so, I'll go ahead and hit save.  If you forget, it's not the end of the world.  As you browse away, it'll ask you did you \r\n\r\n361\r\n00:50:18,233 --> 00:50:26,966\r\nmean to save and so you can save it then, too.  I'm really bad about forgetting that.  All right.  Some of the other options here under Everyone, \r\n\r\n362\r\n00:50:26,966 --> 00:50:34,032\r\nyou can go to apps and if you're part of the Volume App Purchase Program, you'll see any apps that were pushed out as a part of that \r\n\r\n363\r\n00:50:34,033 --> 00:50:42,399\r\npolicy.  Under members, you'll see who this applies to and I can see all of my users and under activity you can see anything that's \r\n\r\n364\r\n00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:50,233\r\nhappened recently.  Now, on the policy side like this you don't see a whole lot.  On the device side we're going to see when devices enroll, \r\n\r\n365\r\n00:50:50,233 --> 00:50:59,933\r\nwhen they become a part of a device group ... a lot of other things will show up for devices.  Speaking of devices ... so, users, we've got our \r\n\r\n366\r\n00:50:59,933 --> 00:51:06,599\r\nusers here and we've got user settings, right.  That's if I wanted to modify settings for a specific user, if I just wanted to go to student three and \r\n\r\n367\r\n00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:17,300\r\ngo to settings, here I can create a policy just for student3.  Right?  Or I can go to groups and I can create a policy just for students and so this \r\n\r\n368\r\n00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:26,433\r\nis what's going to apply just to the students.  For computers it's the same.  I go to devices and here I'll see all of my devices and I can see \r\n\r\n369\r\n00:51:26,433 --> 00:51:35,599\r\nclient1 is the only one that's enrolled, so far, and I can go to settings and here I can customize settings just for computer1.  All right?  But be \r\n\r\n370\r\n00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:45,466\r\naware it's a different set of settings.  There are some settings that only apply to users and there are some settings that only apply to devices, so \r\n\r\n371\r\n00:51:45,466 --> 00:51:53,132\r\nif I go into my settings here, I'll see some different options, some things that I might not have seen under users so some things are a \r\n\r\n372\r\n00:51:53,133 --> 00:52:00,566\r\nlittle bit different here.  Some are the same, like passcode.  Right?  That not any different.  When I configure these settings, these are going to \r\n\r\n373\r\n00:52:00,566 --> 00:52:09,932\r\napply to the device regardless of who logs in.  If a teacher logs in, if a student logs in, it won't matter.  This applies to the device itself, so that \r\n\r\n374\r\n00:52:09,933 --> 00:52:20,766\r\nclient1, if it's an iPad and I want to use it as like a kiosk machine that just runs one application and that's it, right, well I can go in here under \r\n\r\n375\r\n00:52:20,766 --> 00:52:29,966\r\niOS, I can put it in single app mode, and I can pick the app.  Right?  So, I can go in and pick the one that I want and so maybe I want it to be \r\n\r\n376\r\n00:52:29,966 --> 00:52:38,132\r\nmail.  All right?  This is going to be an iPad that I keep in the classroom just for people to check their mail.  Right?  So with this policy, now \r\n\r\n377\r\n00:52:38,133 --> 00:52:46,599\r\nclient1 can only run that mail app and that's it.  Well, client1 for me is a Mac OS machine, not iOS, so this policy is not going to work but if it \r\n\r\n378\r\n00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:54,600\r\nwere an iPad, then now I've got it restricted.  All right.  I'm just going to hit that minus to undo that.  So, these are settings that apply just to \r\n\r\n379\r\n00:52:54,600 --> 00:53:00,966\r\nthe machine, and you'll see some neat stuff in here like directory.  You can actually have them connect to the Open Directory, if they aren't \r\n\r\n380\r\n00:53:00,966 --> 00:53:08,666\r\nalready so they can run this ...  you know, you'd have to use the download feature here, download the policy file.  They run it, and as a part of \r\n\r\n381\r\n00:53:08,666 --> 00:53:16,099\r\napplying the policy they'll join or bind to your directory.  You'll see other things in here, like mobility option, software updates.  We'll take a \r\n\r\n382\r\n00:53:16,100 --> 00:53:27,166\r\nlook at that in one of the next shows.  Time Machine settings, all sorts of good stuff in here pertaining to the machine.  All right, now \r\n\r\n383\r\n00:53:27,166 --> 00:53:35,899\r\ncomputers, devices, they don't have groups in Open Directory.  When you go to Open Directory, you're creating groups for users not for \r\n\r\n384\r\n00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:43,566\r\ncomputers.  All right?  But that doesn't mean you can't create them.  We can create device groups.  If I click on Device Groups, you'll see \r\n\r\n385\r\n00:53:43,566 --> 00:53:49,232\r\nwhere you can add one or you've got a little plus sign down here.  They do the same thing, and we can add a device group in here so I might \r\n\r\n386\r\n00:53:49,233 --> 00:54:01,166\r\ncreate a device group called Student PCs.  All right?  And we do have to be careful here.  If I just go and hit add, see how I didn't save?  I \r\n\r\n387\r\n00:54:01,166 --> 00:54:06,532\r\ndidn't hit that save button at the bottom of the screen, so it's warning me I can hit save and I can add another one.  All right, so here's another \r\n\r\n388\r\n00:54:06,533 --> 00:54:16,566\r\none, new device group, and I can just click on the name here and rename it.  I might have student laptops and then I might have teacher \r\n\r\n389\r\n00:54:16,566 --> 00:54:28,466\r\nPCs, and so on.  Right?  So, I go through and create the various device groups that I want.  I can then use these just like groups for users but \r\n\r\n390\r\n00:54:28,466 --> 00:54:34,866\r\ninstead of pulling the membership from Open Directory, it's actually being pulled right here from the Device Manager so I need to put my \r\n\r\n391\r\n00:54:34,866 --> 00:54:44,699\r\ndevices in the groups they reside in.  So, maybe client1 is a teacher computer, so I go to teacher PCs and I go to members and I can see that it \r\n\r\n392\r\n00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:54,000\r\nhas no members and I'll just add and I'll add that client1.  So, I'm going to go ahead and add it in, and there we go.  So, I've got client1.  It's now \r\n\r\n393\r\n00:54:54,000 --> 00:55:02,666\r\nhere under teacher PCs.  So, I can create settings based on teacher PCs and so under settings I can go through and configure things \r\n\r\n394\r\n00:55:02,666 --> 00:55:09,732\r\nand I can do a different one for student PCs.  So maybe the student PCs I want those really locked down but the teacher PCs I don't.  I want \r\n\r\n395\r\n00:55:09,733 --> 00:55:20,399\r\nthem less restricted, but the problem with doing it this way is what if a teacher logs in on a student PC.  Well, if I applied restrictions on the \r\n\r\n396\r\n00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:28,433\r\nPC itself, it doesn't matter who logs in so those restrictions would apply to the teacher as well as the student but if it's something simple like \r\n\r\n397\r\n00:55:28,433 --> 00:55:35,233\r\nsoftware policies, right, where we're assigning certain applications, then it's fine.  We want that to apply, regardless of who logs in, but other \r\n\r\n398\r\n00:55:35,233 --> 00:55:43,866\r\nthings like software restrictions, we probably want to do that based on our user groups.  That's why you don't see such a a reliance here \r\n\r\n399\r\n00:55:43,866 --> 00:55:52,799\r\non device groups. You see ... you know ... it's really stressing the user side of things more than the device side.  All right. Another thing to \r\n\r\n400\r\n00:55:52,800 --> 00:56:01,833\r\nbe on the lookout for here ... if I'm adding a lot of computers, when I add a new computer, it goes here into devices.  It will show up right here, but \r\n\r\n401\r\n00:56:01,833 --> 00:56:12,033\r\nit will not go into any device group by default so when you first add a new device it's just here under devices.  It won't have any computer level \r\n\r\n402\r\n00:56:12,033 --> 00:56:21,666\r\nprofiles applying to it.  All right?  If you want it to go into a particular device group right at enrollment, you have to do what's called \r\n\r\n403\r\n00:56:21,666 --> 00:56:29,699\r\npre-staging.  Pre-staging the device is where you go and you set up the device in Profile Manager before you enroll it.  If I go into Device \r\n\r\n404\r\n00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:40,933\r\nGroups and into Student PCs, I can go into members and I see I've got no members.  Right?  And if I try and add a device, well, you know, I \r\n\r\n405\r\n00:56:40,933 --> 00:56:49,966\r\ndon't see a client that doesn't exist but what I can do is I can go to devices and under devices I can hit the plus sign down here and you'll see \r\n\r\n406\r\n00:56:49,966 --> 00:56:59,932\r\nwhere I can add a place holder.  A place holder is where we pre-stage a device, and in order to do that, we need to know its serial number.  If \r\n\r\n407\r\n00:56:59,933 --> 00:57:07,499\r\nyou've got one of those order forms from Apple that has all the serial numbers, you can actually import them.  You just make a little .csv and you \r\n\r\n408\r\n00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:16,633\r\ncan import them right in, but I'm going to go ahead and add it manually and I'll punch in that I've got a iOS or iOS X, uh, I mean OS X device.  \r\n\r\n409\r\n00:57:16,633 --> 00:57:27,999\r\nYou'll see Apple TV is listed.  I said that it is supported.  The name ... I'm going to put in OS X client2 and then the serial number.  Now, I'm \r\n\r\n410\r\n00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:34,533\r\nusing a virtual machine for client2 so it doesn't have a real serial number but I'm kind of curious to see if this will work so let me just punch in \r\n\r\n411\r\n00:57:34,533 --> 00:57:43,899\r\nwhat it's got.  So, I'll punch this one in.  This is like an automatically-generated fake serial number that VMware Fusion uses, so I'll just \r\n\r\n412\r\n00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:53,100\r\npunch that in there and add it.  Notice how it doesn't have an icon, it has dashed lines?  That's how we know it's a place holder.  All right.  \r\n\r\n413\r\n00:57:53,100 --> 00:58:00,066\r\nIt's a place holder.  It's waiting for a real machine with that name and that serial number to join.  All right?  And, in fact, the name doesn't even \r\n\r\n414\r\n00:58:00,066 --> 00:58:07,099\r\nreally matter.  It's the serial number that it's truly keying off of, but now that I've got the place holder, I can go to device groups and I can go to \r\n\r\n415\r\n00:58:07,100 --> 00:58:19,133\r\nstudent PCs and members and when I go to add I'll now see that place holder.  There it is, and so I can add it in now.  There we go, and there's the  \r\n\r\n416\r\n00:58:19,133 --> 00:58:28,133\r\nplace holder.  So, now whenever somebody enrolls client2, when it enrolls, the Profile Manager will see the serial number, match it up \r\n\r\n417\r\n00:58:28,133 --> 00:58:35,333\r\nwith this place holder instead of creating a new entry, and it'll already be in the right device group.  So, kind of a neat way to get that taken \r\n\r\n418\r\n00:58:35,333 --> 00:58:42,999\r\ncare of.  If you don't use device groups, then don't worry about that.  There's really no point in pre-staging, if you're not using device groups.  \r\n\r\n419\r\n00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:50,400\r\nThe only real advantage of pre-staging the device like that, creating the place holder is to just have it in a device group already so a particular policy \r\n\r\n420\r\n00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:59,466\r\ncan apply.  All right, so what I want to do next ...  you know, I've kind of given you the guided tour.  Right?  We've run through and seen all the \r\n\r\n421\r\n00:58:59,466 --> 00:59:06,299\r\nscreens, but we haven't actually used it, yet.  So, I want to show you guys building up some policies to restrict some machines, and then I \r\n\r\n422\r\n00:59:06,300 --> 00:59:13,566\r\nwant to show you going and actually restricting some machines. So, we'll get a chance to see that.  I guess I do need to enroll client2.  Let's \r\n\r\n423\r\n00:59:13,566 --> 00:59:19,866\r\ndo that.  I've got maybe enough time left in the segment.  I'm going to go ahead and enroll client2, and we should see it jump into this \r\n\r\n424\r\n00:59:19,866 --> 00:59:26,166\r\nplace holder.  I'm kind of curious to see if this works because I know that virtual machines use a fake serial number but let's see what happens.  \r\n\r\n425\r\n00:59:26,166 --> 00:59:39,399\r\nSo, I'm going to jump over to this other machine and I'm going to fire up its web browser and browse to the server and I'm going to get logged \r\n\r\n426\r\n00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:55,300\r\nin here and I'm just going to go ahead and log in as helpdesk and I'll switch over to the my devices screen and I'm going to go ahead and \r\n\r\n427\r\n00:59:55,300 --> 01:00:03,866\r\nenroll it.  I shouldn't have to trust those certificates.  We'll see.  All right, so there we go.  So, we're enrolling.  It's just giving me my little \r\n\r\n428\r\n01:00:03,866 --> 01:00:19,132\r\nwarning, am I sure that I want to do it and I'll say sure and I'll provide my account.  There we go.  So, now I'm enrolled.  I should show up on the \r\n\r\n429\r\n01:00:19,133 --> 01:00:24,266\r\nother side.  Let's see if it matched with that serial number.  Let me show you what I mean by the weird serial number.  If I go into my, you \r\n\r\n430\r\n01:00:24,266 --> 01:00:31,999\r\nknow, pull down your Apple menu and go to about this Mac and then hit the more info button, you'll see the serial number right there \r\n\r\n431\r\n01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:41,533\r\nand on a normal Mac, like if I take my MacBook here and I go into about this Mac and more info, then you see a nice, normal serial number right \r\n\r\n432\r\n01:00:41,533 --> 01:00:51,099\r\nhere and on this virtual machine I don't see that.  I see this weird one.  It's got a slash in it.  You know, it's like an invalid character, so we'll have \r\n\r\n433\r\n01:00:51,100 --> 01:00:58,866\r\nto see if it actually matches.  All right.  So, I'm going to go back under my devices and ... oh, I guess I need to save changes there.  If I go back \r\n\r\n434\r\n01:00:58,866 --> 01:01:06,499\r\ninto my devices I do see that client2.  It's showing that helpdesk is logged into it, now, and let me go under my device groups and see if it \r\n\r\n435\r\n01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:14,000\r\nactually mapped it into student PCs and, uh, it didn't.  See how it says no members under student PC?  So, it didn't actually map it.  Since \r\n\r\n436\r\n01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:22,333\r\nit had the same name, it just overwrote the other value.  I'm kind of glad that happened.  You can't have two entries with the same name.  They'll \r\n\r\n437\r\n01:01:22,333 --> 01:01:28,799\r\noverwrite each other and so that's what happened is OS X-client2 overwrote the placeholder I made because the serial numbers \r\n\r\n438\r\n01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:37,100\r\ndidn't match so that's what happened there.   You'll get the same thing with device groups.  If you make a mistake, if you hit new and create a \r\n\r\n439\r\n01:01:37,100 --> 01:01:46,433\r\nnew device group and then you hit new again, see how I have two devices called new device group or I have two of those groups?  Well, it'll \r\n\r\n440\r\n01:01:46,433 --> 01:01:54,699\r\nstay that way for a little while.  All right? But at some point in the next few minutes one of them will overwrite the other.  It won't let you have two \r\n\r\n441\r\n01:01:54,700 --> 01:02:00,433\r\nwith the same name, so it'll overwrite the other one and it will become one.  It is a real easy way to lose some settings.  That's why you \r\n\r\n442\r\n01:02:00,433 --> 01:02:06,166\r\nnever want to stick with that default name.  The first thing I always do is go and change that name so I don't have to worry about overwriting \r\n\r\n443\r\n01:02:06,166 --> 01:02:14,332\r\nit.  So be careful with that.  Don't have two entries with the same name.  All right.  Well, let's stop here and take a break.  When we get \r\n\r\n444\r\n01:02:14,333 --> 01:02:20,433\r\nback, we're going to create some restrictions, push them out to a client, and get a chance to see how it does affect a student versus a \r\n\r\n445\r\n01:02:20,433 --> 01:02:24,333\r\nteacher so we'll see it in action.  Staye tuned.  We'll be back after this.  (\r\n\r\n446\r\n01:02:24,333 --> 01:02:31,599\r\nMUSIC)  \r\n\r\n447\r\n01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:39,033\r\nAll right, welcome back everybody.  All right, so what we're going to do now is we are going to actually put some restrictions in place and see \r\n\r\n448\r\n01:02:39,033 --> 01:02:45,366\r\nwhat happens.  Right?  Let's us just throw caution to the wind.  So, I've kind of set up like a school-type environment, so far, so I've got \r\n\r\n449\r\n01:02:45,366 --> 01:02:53,499\r\nstudents and teachers and I want to create some policies that apply based on the type of user logging into the system.  So, I created ...  \r\n\r\n450\r\n01:02:53,500 --> 01:03:02,933\r\nfirst off, I didn't even have to create it.  We had that everyone policy, so this profile that applies to everybody, and the only thing that I said in \r\n\r\n451\r\n01:03:02,933 --> 01:03:11,733\r\nthere was to make you change your password every 90 days.  Well, this show is not going to be 90 days long, so we're not going to see that \r\n\r\n452\r\n01:03:11,733 --> 01:03:19,366\r\npolicy kick in.  Let's create some things that are little more visible, all right, for example, students.   If students are logging into lab \r\n\r\n453\r\n01:03:19,366 --> 01:03:27,132\r\ncomputers or something of that nature, we probably don't want them having a lot of access to the system, and in Mac OS a regular user \r\n\r\n454\r\n01:03:27,133 --> 01:03:34,433\r\nactually does get a good bit of access into the system.  They can't do anything too crazy, like they can't format the hard drive, but they can get \r\n\r\n455\r\n01:03:34,433 --> 01:03:41,499\r\nin and change a lot of stuff, like wallpapers and things of that nature.  So, I want to create a policy that is a little bit more restrictive, based \r\n\r\n456\r\n01:03:41,500 --> 01:03:51,100\r\non the users.  Okay?  So, what I can do is I can go into my groups here and I'll go under students, so that's the students group and I can \r\n\r\n457\r\n01:03:51,100 --> 01:03:59,466\r\nsee it's got those students as a member of it and I'm going to go into settings and I'm going to create a restrictive policy.  Now for students, I \r\n\r\n458\r\n01:03:59,466 --> 01:04:07,099\r\nwant this to be restricted.  I'm taking things away from them, whereas teachers I might be giving them something, or even with students, I \r\n\r\n459\r\n01:04:07,100 --> 01:04:12,600\r\nmight give them something.  I might be giving them apps to be able to use, so, you know, you've got different ways of of kind of applying \r\n\r\n460\r\n01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:20,500\r\nthis.  But, I'm going to go here into students and I'll click on general and we'll go through and start to find the things that we want to mess with.  \r\n\r\n461\r\n01:04:20,500 --> 01:04:27,433\r\nNow, when we're creating a restrictive profile, restrictions that's what we're looking for.  We normally go straight to it.  If you scroll all the \r\n\r\n462\r\n01:04:27,433 --> 01:04:35,466\r\nway down, you'll find a section called restrictions.  It is in here somewhere.  There it is, right there, and we can start to configure \r\n\r\n463\r\n01:04:35,466 --> 01:04:43,699\r\nrestrictions and we can take away things from that user.  All right?  Preferences, that's one of the first places I go.  I typically want to keep \r\n\r\n464\r\n01:04:43,700 --> 01:04:50,500\r\nnon-administrators out of the system preferences folder.  The really sensitive system preferences they can't change without an \r\n\r\n465\r\n01:04:50,500 --> 01:04:57,500\r\nadministrator password, right, but there are some like the time zone.  They can change that if they want without being an administrator, so I \r\n\r\n466\r\n01:04:57,500 --> 01:05:05,633\r\nmight want to take away even that.  So, I'm going to choose to restrict items in system preferences and you'll see enable or disable \r\n\r\n467\r\n01:05:05,633 --> 01:05:13,499\r\nselected items and what I want to do is I want to say enable selected items and I'm going to hit select none and then I'll pick and choose what I \r\n\r\n468\r\n01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:19,800\r\nwant those users to have access to.  So, for a student there's going be certain things they might need.  I might want to give them \r\n\r\n469\r\n01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:31,000\r\naccessibility.  I might want, uh, let's see what else would be good.  How about keyboard ... we'll do ... I'm trying to think of things that might \r\n\r\n470\r\n01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:39,000\r\nhelp them interact with the computer, so I'm not making changes that affect how the computer functions but just helping them to use it so \r\n\r\n471\r\n01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:46,733\r\nthings like mouse, keyboard, those kind of settings are things that I might want to enable and anything that deals with accessibility, right \r\n\r\n472\r\n01:05:46,733 --> 01:05:52,933\r\n...  being able to help people with, you know, vision, speech, hearing impairments, things like that ...  we want to make sure they have that \r\n\r\n473\r\n01:05:52,933 --> 01:06:00,566\r\naccess, too.  So, I'm just going to go through ... I'll allow them to change the sound devices, deal with touchpads, if they want, but I'm going to \r\n\r\n474\r\n01:06:00,566 --> 01:06:07,299\r\nleave all these other things turned off.  I don't want them connecting Bluetooth devices.  I don't want them changing my start-up disk.  A lot of \r\n\r\n475\r\n01:06:07,300 --> 01:06:15,500\r\nthis stuff they'd be blocked from anyway, but here, I'm not even going to let them get into the system preference.  I'm turning all of that off, all \r\n\r\n476\r\n01:06:15,500 --> 01:06:23,033\r\nright.  Under apps, here we can start to customize our applications.  Right off the bat we see allow use of game center.  Well, if we're a \r\n\r\n477\r\n01:06:23,033 --> 01:06:30,299\r\nschool, we probably don't need game center, so I'm just going to that off and then you'll see other options.  We've got allow app store app \r\n\r\n478\r\n01:06:30,300 --> 01:06:38,366\r\nadoption.  If you're not familiar with that, you know the idea is that from now on we should get most of our applications from the Apple App \r\n\r\n479\r\n01:06:38,366 --> 01:06:44,232\r\nStore, right.  We should just pull it right from there, and it makes it easy.  Updates are automatic and so on, but you might still be \r\n\r\n480\r\n01:06:44,233 --> 01:06:53,099\r\ndownloading apps from the vendor websites.  If that happens and you download a vendor app that is also available in the app store, then the \r\n\r\n481\r\n01:06:53,100 --> 01:07:01,100\r\napp store will adopt that app and if updates come out, it'll offer to update it for you through the app store.  So, I can turn that on or off.  \r\n\r\n482\r\n01:07:01,100 --> 01:07:06,833\r\nWell, I probably don't want them installing software anyway, so I'm not really worried about that setting.  I'm going to use this next one to \r\n\r\n483\r\n01:07:06,833 --> 01:07:14,799\r\nsay require admin password to install or update apps.  I don't want them to be able install an app, unless they have an administrative \r\n\r\n484\r\n01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:22,433\r\naccount, all right.  I might want to restrict the app store to software updates only.  If they go in the app store, they can't add anything new, they \r\n\r\n485\r\n01:07:22,433 --> 01:07:29,733\r\ncan just do updates.  Restrict which apps are allowed.  I can actually limit the apps that are allowed to launch, and we can specify exactly \r\n\r\n486\r\n01:07:29,733 --> 01:07:36,799\r\nwhich programs they're allowed to run.  You can put in your line of business applications or educational applications, whatever it is, right in \r\n\r\n487\r\n01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:43,466\r\nhere, and that's all they'll be able to run.  I'm going to leave that off just because we don't have a lot of apps on our machines here.  You \r\n\r\n488\r\n01:07:43,466 --> 01:07:50,366\r\ncan also base it what folder they're in, so applications in this folder can run, applications in that folder can't.  You know, you can create \r\n\r\n489\r\n01:07:50,366 --> 01:07:57,566\r\nlimitations based on that.  Some of the other things we might mess with.  I like to go under media because here's where you can turn off \r\n\r\n490\r\n01:07:57,566 --> 01:08:04,632\r\naccess to external disks, so if somebody brings in a USB key or something of that nature, you may not want them to be able to hook that up.  \r\n\r\n491\r\n01:08:04,633 --> 01:08:12,166\r\nSo, you may choose to outright disable it or you might choose to just require authentication, you know, that they've got to be authenticated to do \r\n\r\n492\r\n01:08:12,166 --> 01:08:19,799\r\nit.  I'm going to turn that off.  I don't want them to have access to external disks.  I don't want them to be able to mount .dmg's, right, because \r\n\r\n493\r\n01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:25,500\r\nreally you'd use that to install software so I don't want that.  I might not want them to have access to the DVD drive, or, you know, maybe I \r\n\r\n494\r\n01:08:25,500 --> 01:08:32,300\r\ndo, maybe I'm okay with that.  So, we might go ahead and choose to flag that and then the same thing with our internal hard drives.  We \r\n\r\n495\r\n01:08:32,300 --> 01:08:41,533\r\ncan kind of pick and choose what we want them to have access to.  On the disk side, CDs, CD-ROMs, DVDs, recordable discs, I might be okay \r\n\r\n496\r\n01:08:41,533 --> 01:08:50,199\r\nwith them reading prewritten discs but not rewritable's.  You know, I don't want them to be able to copy data out of my computer.  All right, \r\n\r\n497\r\n01:08:50,200 --> 01:08:58,266\r\nso those are some different settings that we've got.  There are other things in here, like what we want to allow them to use for sharing and \r\n\r\n498\r\n01:08:58,266 --> 01:09:04,299\r\ndesktop settings, like whether we want them to be able to change the desktop picture.  I can turn that on or off.  It doesn't really matter \r\n\r\n499\r\n01:09:04,300 --> 01:09:10,266\r\nbecause I've locked them out of the display system preference, but we can turn it on here.  You can actually set what you want that \r\n\r\n500\r\n01:09:10,266 --> 01:09:17,566\r\nwallpaper to be here, too.  All right, so quite a few little changes that I made in there, and we'll be able to see that pretty easily, right, just by \r\n\r\n501\r\n01:09:17,566 --> 01:09:26,266\r\nlooking at our system preferences.  I'll go ahead and say okay to that.  All right, so now I've got restrictions for people who are logged in as a \r\n\r\n502\r\n01:09:26,266 --> 01:09:35,866\r\nstudent, all right.  If you're logged in as a teacher, this doesn't apply to you, all right.  They get these settings down here.  Whoops.  \r\n\r\n503\r\n01:09:35,866 --> 01:09:44,266\r\nSee, I forgot to hit save.  I always do that.  If you go down to teachers, they don't have restrictions, right.  So, when a teacher logs in, \r\n\r\n504\r\n01:09:44,266 --> 01:09:48,899\r\nthose restrictions aren't going to be there.  It doesn't mean I don't want them to have restrictions.  They're might be things that I want \r\n\r\n505\r\n01:09:48,900 --> 01:09:55,300\r\nto configure for a teacher.  For example, what if a teacher logs into a computer and then a student asks a question and they get up and \r\n\r\n506\r\n01:09:55,300 --> 01:10:02,600\r\nthey walk away from their desk and they forgot to log out?  Well, the teacher account is a little bit sensitive.  They have access to system \r\n\r\n507\r\n01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:10,066\r\npreferences, so I don't want them to have a situation where they leave themselves logged in on a computer.  So, I might want to enforce a \r\n\r\n508\r\n01:10:10,066 --> 01:10:17,666\r\nshorter screensaver timeout and require a password to unlock the machine, so we can do that.  We'll test my knowledge here, see if I can \r\n\r\n509\r\n01:10:17,666 --> 01:10:25,199\r\nremember where that setting is.  If we go into our settings for this profile, we can browse in here and there are actually two places I want to \r\n\r\n510\r\n01:10:25,200 --> 01:10:32,533\r\ngo.  One is the energy saver, which, oh, actually that's going to be under the computer settings so I'd have to do a computer policy for the \r\n\r\n511\r\n01:10:32,533 --> 01:10:41,999\r\nteacher machines to use the energy saver to set that sleep cycle down to say 10 minutes or whatever, shrinking that down.  That's done on \r\n\r\n512\r\n01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:51,500\r\nthe computer not on the user.  That's why I don't see the setting here.  The other one, though, as far as controlling the lock screen; that one is \r\n\r\n513\r\n01:10:51,500 --> 01:10:58,266\r\nburied away.  Let's see.  It's like display or something.  Let me see if I can find it.  Security and privacy, that might be our winner.  There it \r\n\r\n514\r\n01:10:58,266 --> 01:11:06,366\r\nis.  So, I went under security and privacy here and you'll see like do not allow user to override gatekeeper.  Gatekeeper's what stops us from \r\n\r\n515\r\n01:11:06,366 --> 01:11:13,699\r\nrunning apps we've downloaded from the Internet that aren't digitally signed.  By default any user can right-click and choose open and bypass the \r\n\r\n516\r\n01:11:13,700 --> 01:11:22,466\r\ngatekeeper so we could disable that but we've got require password after sleep or screensaver begins and allow user to set a lock message.  I \r\n\r\n517\r\n01:11:22,466 --> 01:11:30,366\r\ndon't really care about the lock message.  I care about this.  Require a password.  If their machine goes to sleep or if the screen turns off, \r\n\r\n518\r\n01:11:30,366 --> 01:11:37,632\r\nto wake it up they've got to put in a password.  So, if they walk away from the machine and forget to lock the screen, I'm okay with that \r\n\r\n519\r\n01:11:37,633 --> 01:11:44,499\r\nbecause I know the screen is going to go to sleep eventually and then the machine will be locked at that point so we kinda catch it behind \r\n\r\n520\r\n01:11:44,500 --> 01:11:51,700\r\nthe scenes, all right.  Now, the other piece of that, though, is I do need that display to go off after a certain period of time, which I can't do \r\n\r\n521\r\n01:11:51,700 --> 01:11:59,633\r\nhere under the user settings, so I'm going to need to go and take care of that on the PC side, all right.  Before I jump over to the the device \r\n\r\n522\r\n01:11:59,633 --> 01:12:06,699\r\nside, though, I do want to point out one thing here under the general settings.  Notice how general says mandatory?  The general settings \r\n\r\n523\r\n01:12:06,700 --> 01:12:13,833\r\nare always turned on.  You may not of set them over here, but they're always turned on.  There's one setting in here that's super important, this \r\n\r\n524\r\n01:12:13,833 --> 01:12:22,399\r\none at the top, profile distribution type.  It's set to automatic push and that's normally what we want.  We want it to automatically push these \r\n\r\n525\r\n01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:28,733\r\nsettings to the other machines, and remember what I said.  It's not a true push; it's really a notification.  We tell the other side hey there's a \r\n\r\n526\r\n01:12:28,733 --> 01:12:36,299\r\nchange; you need to download it, and the other side will reach out and download it.  If you set it to manual download, it will never automatically \r\n\r\n527\r\n01:12:36,300 --> 01:12:46,800\r\npush out the policy.  You have to download that profile file and copy it over to the other machine and run it, so just be aware if you change that.  \r\n\r\n528\r\n01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:56,433\r\nThe settings for everyone, that one is hard set to automatic, that one you can't change, every other profile you can change.  All right, another \r\n\r\n529\r\n01:12:56,433 --> 01:13:03,633\r\noption is way down here at the bottom, automatically remove profile.  If somebody's bringing an iPad to you to use just for the school \r\n\r\n530\r\n01:13:03,633 --> 01:13:10,066\r\nyear, well, when the school year is over and they go into summer break you might not want to restrict the machine any more.  It's their \r\n\r\n531\r\n01:13:10,066 --> 01:13:18,566\r\nmachine.  You might want to allow them to just go back and be unrestricted and so you can say automatically remove profile on date or after \r\n\r\n532\r\n01:13:18,566 --> 01:13:27,032\r\ninterval and you can say a date so when school ends on May 15 remove this profile and now they have full access to their device again so \r\n\r\n533\r\n01:13:27,033 --> 01:13:34,433\r\nyou can do that kind of setting right here.  I'm just going to leave it back to never.  All right, well, I got part of my teacher settings in place.  \r\n\r\n534\r\n01:13:34,433 --> 01:13:42,966\r\nIt is going to require a password to unlock the screen but now I'm going to go up here to my device groups and I'll forget to hit save so I'll go \r\n\r\n535\r\n01:13:42,966 --> 01:13:50,199\r\nup to my device groups and go to teacher PCs, which is applying to client1, and I'll go into settings here and I'm going to apply it on the \r\n\r\n536\r\n01:13:50,200 --> 01:14:01,266\r\nteacher PCs and when I go into its settings I should see my energy saver in here.  There it is, energy saver, and so now I'll go in here and \r\n\r\n537\r\n01:14:01,266 --> 01:14:08,799\r\nconfigure it and so right now it's set to put the computer to sleep after 10 minutes, put the display to sleep after 5 minutes, and that's \r\n\r\n538\r\n01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:16,066\r\npretty good.  If they walk away from the computer, after five minutes the screen is going to go to sleep and so if the screen goes to \r\n\r\n539\r\n01:14:16,066 --> 01:14:22,999\r\nsleep, well, they've got to wake it up and opt to punch in a password.  Now, you might get some annoyed calls from people saying ah, after 10 \r\n\r\n540\r\n01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:28,666\r\nminutes it goes to sleep, I've got to wake the whole machine up so maybe we want to make that take longer, right.  Maybe we want to go 30 \r\n\r\n541\r\n01:14:28,666 --> 01:14:35,032\r\nminutes on that but I definitely want that screen to go to sleep after 5 minutes of vital time because that'll cause that password to kick in, \r\n\r\n542\r\n01:14:35,033 --> 01:14:44,833\r\nall right.  Now, the default was five minutes so do I really need to create a profile for that?  Well, yes and no.  If you're not really worried \r\n\r\n543\r\n01:14:44,833 --> 01:14:52,366\r\nabout it, you can just leave it at the default time, but the problem with the default is any teacher can go in and change it and make it take longer \r\n\r\n544\r\n01:14:52,366 --> 01:15:00,966\r\nthan what you want it.  By setting it here, it enforces the setting.  They will not be able to over override this.  Their screen will go to sleep \r\n\r\n545\r\n01:15:00,966 --> 01:15:07,999\r\nafter five minutes of vital time no matter what, and they won't have the option to override that.  It would have to be overridden here in the Profile \r\n\r\n546\r\n01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:19,000\r\nManager.  All right, so I'll leave that be. You know, the rest of the settings here I'm fine with.  I'll go ahead and hit okay and I'll save that.  All \r\n\r\n547\r\n01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:26,833\r\nright, now that's just going to apply to the teacher PCs.  Now sometime in the next few minutes these policies are going to be notifying \r\n\r\n548\r\n01:15:26,833 --> 01:15:34,066\r\nthe other systems and the other systems are going to reach out and download.  It can take a moment.  It might not happen instantly.  If I jump \r\n\r\n549\r\n01:15:34,066 --> 01:15:46,099\r\nover here to client1 where I'm logged in as a teacher, I can go into my System Preferences and I can go into Profiles and I can see that I've  \r\n\r\n550\r\n01:15:46,100 --> 01:15:54,900\r\nalready got settings for teachers.  Right, so there's my settings for teacher PCs.  I don't see my user profile, yet, the one that applies ...  oh, \r\n\r\n551\r\n01:15:54,900 --> 01:16:02,600\r\nbecause I didn't create one, right.  We didn't actually have one for teachers.  I forgot.  So I do have my setting for teacher PCs ...  or did I ... \r\n\r\n552\r\n01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:07,633\r\nshoot, you know, it's been m ore than two minutes, so I've already forgotten if we created a teacher one.  It can take a little while for them \r\n\r\n553\r\n01:16:07,633 --> 01:16:13,333\r\nshow up.  It'll just all of a sudden pop up on the screen.  Sometimes you might need to log out and log back in to give it that little kick in the \r\n\r\n554\r\n01:16:13,333 --> 01:16:24,599\r\nbutt to make it load but it will turn up but this setting for teacher PCs is already here.  That's the one where I enforced the energy saver \r\n\r\n555\r\n01:16:24,600 --> 01:16:33,766\r\nsettings and I should see that take effect right now.  If I go into my energy saver and take a look, uh, yeah, see how I can't move my sliders, \r\n\r\n556\r\n01:16:33,766 --> 01:16:42,499\r\nright.  If I click my lock to do a change and I punch in, you know, that I am teacher1 and I go to unlock ... oh, you know what, they're not an \r\n\r\n557\r\n01:16:42,500 --> 01:16:49,833\r\nadministrator.  Let me punch in an actual administrator.  All right, so I just punched in helpdesk.  I'm an administrator, right, so I can \r\n\r\n558\r\n01:16:49,833 --> 01:16:55,833\r\ngo in and I can make that change ... oh, so it hasn't actually applied, yet.  Even an administrator shouldn't be able to make the \r\n\r\n559\r\n01:16:55,833 --> 01:17:02,999\r\nchange because it applies to the PC so that policy ...  it's downloaded but it hasn't actually applied, yet.  So you know what I'm going to do?  \r\n\r\n560\r\n01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:09,600\r\nI'm going to give this machine a reboot just to give it that kind of kick to make sure it gets that stuff.  While it's doing that, I'm going to jump \r\n\r\n561\r\n01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:24,500\r\nover to client2 and on client2 I'm going to log out and log in as a student.  All right, so I'm just going to log out here.  I'm going to wait a second \r\n\r\n562\r\n01:17:24,500 --> 01:17:31,966\r\nfor it to see the directory and then I'm going to log in as one of those student accounts.  So, I'll give it just a moment.  Eventually, it will see the \r\n\r\n563\r\n01:17:31,966 --> 01:17:43,699\r\ndirectory.  This is where my patience starts to get  limited, depending on ... oh, there we go.  It didn't take too long.  Now, I'll to go other and I'll \r\n\r\n564\r\n01:17:43,700 --> 01:17:54,833\r\npunch in student1.  All right, now, when I log in  this should give it that kick.  It should reach out and download that profile.  I'm using the \r\n\r\n565\r\n01:17:54,833 --> 01:18:01,933\r\noperative word of should.  It is kind of subjective, especially if you've got a remote system because it's communicating through Apple \r\n\r\n566\r\n01:18:01,933 --> 01:18:08,533\r\nservers so it could take...  it could take as long as half an hour sometimes for a profile to show up.  Sometimes you have to wait or there could \r\n\r\n567\r\n01:18:08,533 --> 01:18:15,966\r\nbe connectivity issues.  Remember, if our certificates are not working, if we've got bad certificate trusts, then we're not going to trust \r\n\r\n568\r\n01:18:15,966 --> 01:18:22,466\r\nthe other side and so the automatic element is not going to work there, either, so those are all little things that can cause the profiles not to \r\n\r\n569\r\n01:18:22,466 --> 01:18:31,866\r\napply.  All right, but I'm logged in and actually I know this one's working because look at all of my system preferences.  I can't even click on \r\n\r\n570\r\n01:18:31,866 --> 01:18:41,932\r\nthem.  They're grayed out, not all of them, right.  I can go into dictation and speech.  I can go into keyboard.  Those are ones that I left on because \r\n\r\n571\r\n01:18:41,933 --> 01:18:49,933\r\nI wanted to make sure that students that needed to enable accessibility options or whatever could get in and do.  Here are the sound options.  So I \r\n\r\n572\r\n01:18:49,933 --> 01:19:03,366\r\nknow that that profile is taking effect.  Whoops, that's not what I wanted.  That is definitely different.  All right, so, I know that it is taking \r\n\r\n573\r\n01:19:03,366 --> 01:19:11,532\r\neffect (LAUGHING), if I can get back to my machine.  There we go.  I got VMware fusion crazy.  So, I know it is taking effect.  I can't \r\n\r\n574\r\n01:19:11,533 --> 01:19:25,733\r\nactually get in to see the profile, though, because I blocked that system preference so I can't see it there but I could fire up the webpage \r\n\r\n575\r\n01:19:25,733 --> 01:19:33,299\r\nso I should be able to get logged in here and I'll log ...  I think I registered that one under helpdesk.  Oh, shoot, I'm forgetting something.  \r\n\r\n576\r\n01:19:33,300 --> 01:19:41,000\r\nIt actually won't show up on the webpage.  The webpage doesn't show all the profiles by default.  It shows, you know, ones based on what was \r\n\r\n577\r\n01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:47,133\r\ninitially set when you enrolled.  So, yeah, you really would need to go unto that profile system preference, which I have blocked, but either way \r\n\r\n578\r\n01:19:47,133 --> 01:19:54,799\r\nI know it's working because my system preferences are restricted.  Now, the cool part here is if I log out and log in as a teacher.  That \r\n\r\n579\r\n01:19:54,800 --> 01:20:04,933\r\nprofile was set to apply to students, people in the student group, so if I log in as a teacher, teachers aren't in the student group so they'll \r\n\r\n580\r\n01:20:04,933 --> 01:20:15,633\r\nget the settings that don't include the restrictions and they should be able to see the preferences.  So, if I log in as teacher1, here we \r\n\r\n581\r\n01:20:15,633 --> 01:20:25,333\r\ngo, and teacher1 has never logged in on this computer before, that I know of, so I'm just going to get logged in here as teacher1, and if I go into \r\n\r\n582\r\n01:20:25,333 --> 01:20:35,099\r\nmy system preferences, I can see all of my buttons are lit up here, I can get in, I can even look at my profiles, if I want, and I can see that \r\n\r\n583\r\n01:20:35,100 --> 01:20:43,533\r\nthat settings for the student doesn't even show up and that's because I'm not a student.  All right, I'm also not on a teacher PC.  I'm on \r\n\r\n584\r\n01:20:43,533 --> 01:20:51,066\r\nclient2.  Client2 was a student PC so that's why I don't see the setting for teacher PCs.  There are my settings for teachers that just came \r\n\r\n585\r\n01:20:51,066 --> 01:20:59,099\r\ndown, not teacher PCs but teachers.  That's that setting that included...  it included the...  uh, what did we include on that one?  The, uh, oh \r\n\r\n586\r\n01:20:59,100 --> 01:21:06,600\r\nrequire password to unlock the screen saver, right, so that one's in there but not the power settings, which means I should be able to see \r\n\r\n587\r\n01:21:06,600 --> 01:21:18,633\r\nboth over on client1.  So, on client1, I'm going to log back in as teacher1 and we should be good to go here.  This one should have both, the \r\n\r\n588\r\n01:21:18,633 --> 01:21:32,433\r\nsettings for the teacher as well as the settings for the teacher PC, so I'm going to just jump in here and take a look and see what it's got.  \r\n\r\n589\r\n01:21:32,433 --> 01:21:42,099\r\nThere we go.  So, I can see my settings for teacher PCs and my setting for teachers, and if I go into my system preferences and I come in \r\n\r\n590\r\n01:21:42,100 --> 01:21:51,500\r\nhere I can take a look at my energy saver and it is set for...  I can't really tell.  I think that's five minutes.  That's back to 30 minutes, and if I \r\n\r\n591\r\n01:21:51,500 --> 01:22:03,066\r\ntake a look at my security settings, I've got that require password immediately after sleep where screensaver begins and I can't uncheck that \r\n\r\n592\r\n01:22:03,066 --> 01:22:13,966\r\none.  If I try... well, again, I'm not an administrator.  There we go.  So, now I unlocked it as administrator, and I still can't check that \r\n\r\n593\r\n01:22:13,966 --> 01:22:22,832\r\nand that's because the profile is setting it.  I can't override the profile from the client.  You have to go to the server to override that profile, \r\n\r\n594\r\n01:22:22,833 --> 01:22:37,933\r\nall right, and if I go back to my screensaver ... or not screensaver, shoot, if I go to my energy saver here and unlock ...  well, it is letting me do \r\n\r\n595\r\n01:22:37,933 --> 01:22:48,299\r\nthat one.  I guess maybe that setting doesn't get locked.  I thought it did.  Hmmm.  Well, the neat part here is if I do override it, so if I come in here \r\n\r\n596\r\n01:22:48,300 --> 01:22:54,266\r\nand change the settings, the next time the profile takes effect it is just going to put it right back, again.  It should lock it.  That one setting \r\n\r\n597\r\n01:22:54,266 --> 01:23:02,499\r\nmight not actually be applying, but I know the other one is because if I come in here, I can't uncheck that even as an administrator.  So, \r\n\r\n598\r\n01:23:02,500 --> 01:23:11,033\r\npretty cool stuff there.  There's a lot more inside of the profiles.  If you just kind of browse through and look at all the settings, there are several \r\n\r\n599\r\n01:23:11,033 --> 01:23:17,533\r\nscreens of it.  The exam doesn't get super nitpicky.  It doesn't expect you to have them all memorized.  They want you to understand the \r\n\r\n600\r\n01:23:17,533 --> 01:23:25,033\r\nconcept of creating a profile and pushing them out to the machines.  That's what we need to know for the exams, but for real life land take a \r\n\r\n601\r\n01:23:25,033 --> 01:23:31,166\r\nwalk through there.  Look at all the different settings.  There's some neat stuff.  There are some really cool things there, and it is really \r\n\r\n602\r\n01:23:31,166 --> 01:23:38,499\r\npowerful, especially if you're managing tons of Macs and you don't want to reimage them every week because they've gotten messed up.  Here \r\n\r\n603\r\n01:23:38,500 --> 01:23:46,366\r\nwe can restrict it, and we can stop that from happening in the first place.  All right.  Let's see.  What am I forgetting.  There's something else... \r\n\r\n604\r\n01:23:46,366 --> 01:23:55,599\r\nummm...  oh, device lock and wipe.  One of the coolest things is that when we're managing these devices with the Profile Manager and one \r\n\r\n605\r\n01:23:55,600 --> 01:24:05,100\r\nof them gets lost or, you know, we lose control of it or whatever we can remotely lock it or remotely wipe it, all right, really useful for iPads \r\n\r\n606\r\n01:24:05,100 --> 01:24:12,300\r\nand iPhones and laptops.  You know, they get lost.  We can reach out and lock them or reach out and wipe them and stop our data from \r\n\r\n607\r\n01:24:12,300 --> 01:24:21,100\r\nleaking outside of our organization.  Pretty easy to do, if we go back to our Profile Manager, and we can come in here to our devices and find a \r\n\r\n608\r\n01:24:21,100 --> 01:24:29,766\r\ndevice.  Inside of our devices you'll see, you know, our various settings that are in here.  You can go to about and see some information, and \r\n\r\n609\r\n01:24:29,766 --> 01:24:37,866\r\nif you click the little gear button, you'll see lock and wipe right there.  An end user can actually log into the webpage and they'll see the lock \r\n\r\n610\r\n01:24:37,866 --> 01:24:44,299\r\nand wipe options there on the webpage, too, if they want to do it themselves for a device that they enrolled, right, but as an administrator, we \r\n\r\n611\r\n01:24:44,300 --> 01:24:52,100\r\ncan do it for any device.   We just find it in here and we choose it.  So, if I take client1, right.  Let's look at client1.  Client1 is just sitting here \r\n\r\n612\r\n01:24:52,100 --> 01:25:01,266\r\nright now looking at a system preference, right.  So if I take client1 and I go in here and tell it to lock, I need to give it a password and the \r\n\r\n613\r\n01:25:01,266 --> 01:25:13,266\r\npassword just needs to be six characters or more so I'll just punch in 123456 and that's the machine that I am locking and I'll go ahead and \r\n\r\n614\r\n01:25:13,266 --> 01:25:20,566\r\nlock it.  So, the lock was sent.  If I go to my activity screen here, I can see the lock was sent and that it's in progress.  That means I sent the \r\n\r\n615\r\n01:25:20,566 --> 01:25:28,766\r\nmessage to Apple but I haven't heard that it's done yet and now I see it succeeded.  Apple told me that it did lock.  If I look over, that \r\n\r\n616\r\n01:25:28,766 --> 01:25:38,232\r\nmachine rebooted, all right.  When you lock a machine it reboots and when it boots back up it's going to boot to a special lock screen and no \r\n\r\n617\r\n01:25:38,233 --> 01:25:45,766\r\none can log into this system until they provide the passcode that we just put in a minute ago.  The system is now rendered, you know, \r\n\r\n618\r\n01:25:45,766 --> 01:25:53,799\r\nineffective.  If we combine this with FileVault, right, FileVault 2, the file encryption on our system, we can have an encrypted hard drive \r\n\r\n619\r\n01:25:53,800 --> 01:26:00,533\r\nand now it's locked and our data is safe.  Someone could still format the drive if they really wanted to or just replace the physical drive but \r\n\r\n620\r\n01:26:00,533 --> 01:26:08,066\r\nthey wouldn't be able to get at our data because it is encrypted and they can't log in because the screen is locked, all right.  So, there it is.  So, \r\n\r\n621\r\n01:26:08,066 --> 01:26:15,432\r\nthis is what I see and what are my options sleep, restart, shutdown, or punch in my pin code, all right.  If I punch in the pin code, it'll just \r\n\r\n622\r\n01:26:15,433 --> 01:26:26,966\r\nboot right back up like normal.  There we go, and off it goes, right, It does have to reboot for it.  If I don't know the pin code, though, it is just \r\n\r\n623\r\n01:26:26,966 --> 01:26:33,632\r\nsitting there and it's stuck and like I said combined with FileVault 2 we get some pretty good security, all right.  The other thing we could \r\n\r\n624\r\n01:26:33,633 --> 01:26:42,633\r\nhave done is wiped it.  Wipe works great for iPhones and iPads, erases all of your data.  Wipe works okay for desktops.  Desktops and \r\n\r\n625\r\n01:26:42,633 --> 01:26:51,299\r\nlaptops, it's better to use FileVault 2 and screen lock instead, but wipe... it does work.  It actually removes some of the user data without removing \r\n\r\n626\r\n01:26:51,300 --> 01:27:00,466\r\nthe OS, though, so sometimes it's hard to see that it actually worked but it does.  All right, so those are some of the other options there and \r\n\r\n627\r\n01:27:00,466 --> 01:27:05,766\r\nthen, you know, whenever we're done with the machine if we want to remove it from management, you can always just choose that \r\n\r\n628\r\n01:27:05,766 --> 01:27:13,966\r\ndevice and use the minus sign to deenroll it.  When it when it removes it see what it does?  A placeholder will remain and that way if you ever \r\n\r\n629\r\n01:27:13,966 --> 01:27:24,266\r\nreenroll it, it just gets the same settings back and put in place.  All right, so, I can revert to a placeholder or we can unroll it and just toss the \r\n\r\n630\r\n01:27:24,266 --> 01:27:30,666\r\nwhole thing.  I guess maybe I'll do that.  So, I'm going to unenroll client2 and so it's going to knock it out and, you know, it left a placeholder \r\n\r\n631\r\n01:27:30,666 --> 01:27:39,466\r\nback, didn't it?  But anyhow, so, it's removed.  It's now out of the system and over here on client2, well, I'm logged in as teacher1 right now \r\n\r\n632\r\n01:27:39,466 --> 01:27:47,199\r\nbut that policy is being removed in the background and I don't even have that profile system preference any more.  It's gone and I'm \r\n\r\n633\r\n01:27:47,200 --> 01:27:58,233\r\nback to having an individually-managed system.  All right, and this one just booted back up so teacher1 can log back into her machine and \r\n\r\n634\r\n01:27:58,233 --> 01:28:08,266\r\nshe'll be in business.  All right, so key things to remember about Profile Manager.  It's part of the server app.  It's a little bit more involved to get it \r\n\r\n635\r\n01:28:08,266 --> 01:28:15,866\r\nset up than it is, you know, any of the other things that we talked about in this show so a few extra steps.  It's completely dependent upon \r\n\r\n636\r\n01:28:15,866 --> 01:28:23,999\r\nthe open directory so you definitely want to have an open directory set up.  If you don't, it'll set one up for you so be aware of that and then \r\n\r\n637\r\n01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:30,900\r\nonce you've got it in place the sky's the limit.  Most problems that I've encountered out in real life land have been certificate based.  \r\n\r\n638\r\n01:28:30,900 --> 01:28:38,833\r\nCertificates are normally where the issue is.  If you want to make life really easy, go out and buy a real certificate.  Back in your server app \r\n\r\n639\r\n01:28:38,833 --> 01:28:47,466\r\nscreen, if you go to certificates, right here you'll see where you can come in and start a get a trusted certificate wizard.  Just use that little \r\n\r\n640\r\n01:28:47,466 --> 01:28:54,499\r\nplus sign there, and you can go through the process of buying a real certificate from an Internet-authorized provider.  If you do that, your \r\n\r\n641\r\n01:28:54,500 --> 01:29:02,233\r\ncertificate worries are gone.  It costs usually less than $100 a year and you can get that put in place and go.  Self-signed certificates work \r\n\r\n642\r\n01:29:02,233 --> 01:29:09,233\r\nfine, too, as long as all of your machines are either bound to your open directory or you exported and imported that certificate onto the \r\n\r\n643\r\n01:29:09,233 --> 01:29:18,699\r\nother machine so just be aware of that and that is usually the number one source of problems with profile management.  All right, well, that's \r\n\r\n644\r\n01:29:18,700 --> 01:29:26,166\r\nabout all I've got on Profile Managers so this is a pretty good spot to wrap things up.  Let me just remind you guys, if you have any questions on \r\n\r\n645\r\n01:29:26,166 --> 01:29:34,066\r\nthis stuff, live during the show you can go to itpro.tv/live and you'll see the chat room right beneath the video.  You can post your questions \r\n\r\n646\r\n01:29:34,066 --> 01:29:41,766\r\nthere.  We monitor and answer during the show.  If you have questions after the show, like if your watching this recorded, well, you can hit that \r\n\r\n647\r\n01:29:41,766 --> 01:29:48,066\r\nQ&A link up at the top of the screen.  It will take you into our Q&A forums.  Post your question there.  We monitor and answer.  We want to \r\n\r\n648\r\n01:29:48,066 --> 01:29:55,099\r\nmake sure you have the information you need to be successful on that exam.  All right, well, I hope you guys enjoyed the show.

I'm your host, Don Pezet, \r\n\r\n3\r\n00:00:40,433 --> 00:00:49,533\r\nback again with another episode of Apple Certified Associate.  Well, it's been a short trip, but this is the end of the road for us ... our final \r\n\r\n4\r\n00:00:49,533 --> 00:00:57,033\r\nepisode  on covering Mac Management Basics.  Now if you've been following along in your handy-dandy book, then you'll know that there are \r\n\r\n5\r\n00:00:57,033 --> 00:01:06,299\r\nactually two sections left that we haven't gotten to and that's Software Updates and Caching.  Well, the two systems are actually really, really \r\n\r\n6\r\n00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:12,800\r\nsimilar, very tied together, and so we're going to combine them into one episode here.  So we're going to take a look at managing software \r\n\r\n7\r\n00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:21,200\r\nupdates for our Macs first and then we'll take a look at software and download caching afterwards just all right here.  All right, now \r\n\r\n8\r\n00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:28,600\r\nI said software updates.  What the heck am I  talking about?  Well, believe it or not when you get your brand new shiny Mac and you crack \r\n\r\n9\r\n00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:36,300\r\nopen the box and you take it out and power it on, it's probably already out of date.  Apple is constantly pushing new updates out for their \r\n\r\n10\r\n00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:45,466\r\nsoftware either in response to security concerns or just bugs, things that aren't working right, or introducing new functionality, new features, and \r\n\r\n11\r\n00:01:45,466 --> 00:01:54,332\r\nimprovements over that base OS that, you know, shipped out originally on that hardware.  Now,  Apple does a great job of updating their systems \r\n\r\n12\r\n00:01:54,333 --> 00:02:01,399\r\nbefore they're sent to you, so they're not going not to be super out of date, but you're still going to need to take some steps to get them current.   \r\n\r\n13\r\n00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:12,033\r\nYou do want to apply updates.  Security updates are really important, and I know as a general rule your Mac is not going to get a virus.  \r\n\r\n14\r\n00:02:12,033 --> 00:02:20,066\r\nRight?  There are not a lot of Macintosh viruses that are out there.  There are even fewer iPad or iOS viruses that are out there, too, so it is not a \r\n\r\n15\r\n00:02:20,066 --> 00:02:26,599\r\nvery common thing but it's not necessarily viruses that we need to worry about.  There are general hacking attempts where outsiders are \r\n\r\n16\r\n00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:33,933\r\nmanaging to get into your system and that happens through security holes in any of the software you run.  It may not even be Apple's \r\n\r\n17\r\n00:02:33,933 --> 00:02:42,666\r\nfault but Apple is very aggressive about it and when an exploit like that is detected they patch it and they push it out as a software update.   \r\n\r\n18\r\n00:02:42,666 --> 00:02:49,666\r\nYou don't need separate software.  It's all part of your host OS that's doing it and it's basically trying to keep itself up to date.  All right?  Well, \r\n\r\n19\r\n00:02:49,666 --> 00:02:58,032\r\nin a normal system like my MacBook right here ...  so this is just my laptop and it reaches directly out to the Internet ... reaches out to \r\n\r\n20\r\n00:02:58,033 --> 00:03:03,633\r\nApple and says hey, are there any updates and Apple responds back and says yeah here are some updates and then we download them and \r\n\r\n21\r\n00:03:03,633 --> 00:03:13,133\r\nwe apply them and that works out great.  Right?  Well that's just one laptop.  What if I have 1000 laptops or 1000 desktops.  Well, all 1000 \r\n\r\n22\r\n00:03:13,133 --> 00:03:20,933\r\nof them are going to reach out to Apple and say hey, is there an update and Apple will say sure here it is and then they're all going to download \r\n\r\n23\r\n00:03:20,933 --> 00:03:29,333\r\nit downloading the same file 1000 times.  It's not very efficient.  It'll work.  I mean you can do it.  If you've got the bandwidth and the time that \r\n\r\n24\r\n00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:38,366\r\nworks out great but wouldn't it be nice if we could download the file once, download it one time from Apple, store it on one of our servers, \r\n\r\n25\r\n00:03:38,366 --> 00:03:46,099\r\nand then distribute it out internally so we're not eating up all of our Internet bandwidth to do those updates.  All right?  If that sounds nice \r\n\r\n26\r\n00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:57,100\r\nwell it is and we can do that with our server app.  All right.  There is another side to this coin so when it comes to running your own software \r\n\r\n27\r\n00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:04,066\r\nupdate server, bandwidth savings is important, right, but maybe we have plenty of bandwidth.  Maybe that's not our  main issue.  All right?  So \r\n\r\n28\r\n00:04:04,066 --> 00:04:12,399\r\nthat's not the only reason we might want to do our own software updates.  The other reason is updates might come out and you might not be \r\n\r\n29\r\n00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:18,600\r\nready for them, yet.  All right, now what do I mean by that?  Well, if it's a security update, you probably want to apply it as soon as you \r\n\r\n30\r\n00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:26,633\r\ncan but what if it's a new feature.  Right?  Some of you guys might remember when Final Cut Pro was updated and it got this new update and it \r\n\r\n31\r\n00:04:26,633 --> 00:04:34,399\r\nreally messed with how you accessed your older files that were made.  So you might not be ready for that update, yet, so wouldn't it be nice \r\n\r\n32\r\n00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:43,300\r\nif you could control which update your end-users saw and which ones they didn't so if you weren't ready for that new app update you could block it \r\n\r\n33\r\n00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:51,700\r\nand stay at the older version until you either were ready for it or did testing to make sure it wouldn't interfere with your system.  If you just \r\n\r\n34\r\n00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:58,800\r\nblindly push out updates right when they come out, it's possible you could push out software that doesn't work right so it's kind of nice to give \r\n\r\n35\r\n00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:07,666\r\nit a little time to make sure that everything is on the up and up.  All right.  Apple actually has a recommended procedure.  It's in the book for \r\n\r\n36\r\n00:05:07,666 --> 00:05:16,732\r\nthis course but basically it boils down to this.  They recommend a a three-phase approach to rolling out updates.  All right?  In the first phase, \r\n\r\n37\r\n00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:26,033\r\nwhat they recommend is a cooling off period.  When an update comes out, you let it cool down.  Don't apply the update on day one.  They \r\n\r\n38\r\n00:05:26,033 --> 00:05:36,833\r\nrecommend waiting seven days.  Wait a week.  All right?  So a new update comes out for iPhoto, right, and we wait a week.  During that \r\n\r\n39\r\n00:05:36,833 --> 00:05:45,999\r\nweek, other people on the Internet apply that update and if there's any bugs or quirks or problems or whatever, they'll find it, they'll report \r\n\r\n40\r\n00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:52,366\r\nit, and hopefully, a new update will be released that fixes those bugs but if it goes an entire week and you don't hear anything about \r\n\r\n41\r\n00:05:52,366 --> 00:06:00,032\r\nproblems or you do your own testing and don't hear about problems, then you're probably ready to go.  So phase I is just cooling off.  Let it sit \r\n\r\n42\r\n00:06:00,033 --> 00:06:10,499\r\nfor seven days and let other people deal with the problems.  All right?  After seven days, we then move into phase 2.  In phase 2 we take the \r\n\r\n43\r\n00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:18,966\r\nupdate and we deploy it not to our whole organization but to a pilot group just a small group of people.  I usually use the IT department \r\n\r\n44\r\n00:06:18,966 --> 00:06:26,099\r\nas a test, you know, deploy to them but you can deploy to just a sample group of people throughout your organization and let them run \r\n\r\n45\r\n00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:35,100\r\nwith the update.  All right?  Apple recommends you go five days in phase 2.  In five days, your people have a chance to use that new updated \r\n\r\n46\r\n00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:42,733\r\nsoftware and see if there's any quirks and if there's a problem, well, it'll only affect that pilot group, that small group of people that you \r\n\r\n47\r\n00:06:42,733 --> 00:06:50,933\r\ndeployed the update for.  The whole rest of your company or organization is still running the old version and they're fine, all right, but if we go all \r\n\r\n48\r\n00:06:50,933 --> 00:06:59,999\r\nfive days and everything tests out fine and everything is great, then we go into phase 3 and in phase 3 we roll the update out to the whole \r\n\r\n49\r\n00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:07,700\r\nrest of our company.  We push it out and let the rest of the company get it.  All right?  That's Apple's recommended procedure.  That means \r\n\r\n50\r\n00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:15,933\r\nwhen an update comes out, you won't roll it out to your entire company for 12 days.  All right?  Let's just recap.  Phase 1, seven-day cooling off \r\n\r\n51\r\n00:07:15,933 --> 00:07:25,233\r\nperiod, don't install for anybody.  Phase 2, five-day testing period, roll it out to your pilot group, and then phase 3, we roll it out to the whole rest \r\n\r\n52\r\n00:07:25,233 --> 00:07:32,333\r\nof the organization.  That's the Apple recommended procedure.  Now, if it's a security update, you may not want to wait 12 days, right, \r\n\r\n53\r\n00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:39,833\r\nbut for a new feature update, it's a new feature.  It's not something you already had, so waiting 12 days is not such a big deal.  All right?  So \r\n\r\n54\r\n00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:48,166\r\nthat's the recommendation.  The problem is when you buy that nice new shiny Mac it's set to do automatic updates by default.  That's the \r\n\r\n55\r\n00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:57,366\r\ndefault setting in OS X, so it's going to reach out to Apple and download updates on a regular basis.  Right?  If we take a look ... like here, I'll \r\n\r\n56\r\n00:07:57,366 --> 00:08:06,966\r\njust take my little server box and I haven't messed with its updates from the default.  If I go up here to my Apple icon and I go to system \r\n\r\n57\r\n00:08:06,966 --> 00:08:17,866\r\npreferences and inside of my system preferences if I go into my app store settings, which are right here, I can see automatically \r\n\r\n58\r\n00:08:17,866 --> 00:08:25,332\r\ncheck for updates, download newly available updates in the background, install system data and file security updates.  All right.  Install app \r\n\r\n59\r\n00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:32,333\r\nupdates is not chosen by default so any apps that I purchase or download from the App Store I have to update those myself, so like the server \r\n\r\n60\r\n00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:41,066\r\napp that I'm running and the remote desktop app that we were running in an earlier show, I'll have to update those myself but as far as OS X itself \r\n\r\n61\r\n00:08:41,066 --> 00:08:47,266\r\nit's going to be downloading those system updates and doing security updates automatically.  All right?  So, if we want to \r\n\r\n62\r\n00:08:47,266 --> 00:08:55,999\r\ncontrol the updates that our systems get, this isn't going to let us do it, right, or well, I guess it could, if we went and physically touched each of \r\n\r\n63\r\n00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:02,233\r\n1,000 machines in our organization to update this value to turn off automatic updates but we don't want our end-users to have to manually do \r\n\r\n64\r\n00:09:02,233 --> 00:09:11,899\r\nthe updates, either, so there's got to be a better middle ground, all right, and there is.  As part of the server app, if I go back to my server app \r\n\r\n65\r\n00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:22,700\r\nright here, under advanced you'll actually see where you can run the software update service.  The software update service is where you \r\n\r\n66\r\n00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:30,266\r\nbasically run your own Apple software update server.  Right?  All the Macs that are out there that are configured for automatic updates, \r\n\r\n67\r\n00:09:30,266 --> 00:09:37,366\r\nthey're reaching out to Apple and they're downloading the updates straight from there.  Well,  you can create your own Apple update \r\n\r\n68\r\n00:09:37,366 --> 00:09:45,366\r\nserver that runs right there on your local network. It can reach out to Apple and download the updates and then the updates are sitting \r\n\r\n69\r\n00:09:45,366 --> 00:09:55,132\r\nright here on this machine and when clients want to go for updates we can configure them instead of going out to Apple to go to our server \r\n\r\n70\r\n00:09:55,133 --> 00:10:02,666\r\nto reach right here and get the updates from this system.  All right.  By doing that, by making ourselves a middleman for the update process, \r\n\r\n71\r\n00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:10,966\r\nwe can control what updates people get.  We can manually choose to approve or disallow the updates, all right, and in fact, when you go \r\n\r\n72\r\n00:10:10,966 --> 00:10:17,832\r\nthere, when you click on software update, you'll see there's really not a whole lot of options here.  There's just this one main option, which is \r\n\r\n73\r\n00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:25,766\r\nwhether we want to be in automatic mode or manual mode.  All right.  In a strict IT environment where we want to control the \r\n\r\n74\r\n00:10:25,766 --> 00:10:35,532\r\nupdates people get, we'll want manual mode.  In manual mode, our server will download updates that it finds, but it will not distribute them to your \r\n\r\n75\r\n00:10:35,533 --> 00:10:43,733\r\nend-users.  All right.  It brings them in and then we have to enable the ones that we want to be distributed out to our clients, so we can pick \r\n\r\n76\r\n00:10:43,733 --> 00:10:51,599\r\nand choose when we're ready which updates our clients will actually download and get.  All right.  In automatic mode, it will download the updates \r\n\r\n77\r\n00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:59,166\r\nfrom Apple and immediately begin distributing them to your clients.  All right.  If it's immediate, why would we bother doing that?  Well, when \r\n\r\n78\r\n00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:06,632\r\nyou choose automatic, you're really just saying I want to save bandwidth.  I just want to download the updates once and then distribute them to \r\n\r\n79\r\n00:11:06,633 --> 00:11:13,199\r\nmy clients instead of having all of my clients download them individually so that will cut down on your Internet bandwidth.  If bandwidth is your \r\n\r\n80\r\n00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:19,633\r\nonly concern, then you go in automatic mode.  When new updates come out, your server will download them and automatically push them \r\n\r\n81\r\n00:11:19,633 --> 00:11:26,299\r\nout.  You you set it and forget it like that rotisserie chicken commercial.  You don't even have to touch it again.  You just turn it on, walk \r\n\r\n82\r\n00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:35,166\r\naway, and that's the end of it, all right, but if you want to be able to have control, you'll need to go the manual route.  That's really the only option \r\n\r\n83\r\n00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:44,332\r\nhere.  All right.  Once we've got that, we just flip the on switch and now we're running a software update server.  All right. Now, we're not quite \r\n\r\n84\r\n00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:53,733\r\ndone.  Once the software update server is running, it's not really functional until it reaches out and gets the updates from Apple.  All right.  \r\n\r\n85\r\n00:11:53,733 --> 00:12:00,766\r\nNow the process, if you read Apple's documentation, they say it can take hours.  It's been my experience that it takes about 20 \r\n\r\n86\r\n00:12:00,766 --> 00:12:08,799\r\nminutes.  It takes about 20 minutes for your system just to learn about the updates that are out there and then to download the updates \r\n\r\n87\r\n00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:17,233\r\ndoes take hours so it can take a long time to get this set up so don't expect instantaneous results.  When we go to the updates tab here \r\n\r\n88\r\n00:12:17,233 --> 00:12:24,966\r\nthats where we'll see the updates that are available from Apple.  Now, see how my list is fully populated?  That's because I knew it took a \r\n\r\n89\r\n00:12:24,966 --> 00:12:33,799\r\nlong time so before the show I went ahead and got that populated.  In real life, when you turn this on and jump to updates expect to see a \r\n\r\n90\r\n00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:41,766\r\nblank screen.  You're probably not gonna see much there.  It'll be blank for about 20 minutes and then after that you'll see a list of the \r\n\r\n91\r\n00:12:41,766 --> 00:12:48,566\r\nupdates but it's still not done.  Now it's downloading the updates.  It's got to download those and get them on here if you've got that \r\n\r\n92\r\n00:12:48,566 --> 00:12:54,699\r\nautomatically download new updates checkmarked.  See this checkmark I've got?  I don't have it checked.  That means my system \r\n\r\n93\r\n00:12:54,700 --> 00:13:03,600\r\nlearned about these updates but didn't actually download them.  As it is right now, I have control of what updates people see, but they're still \r\n\r\n94\r\n00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:10,533\r\ngoing to have to go out and download them from Apple because I didn't download a local copy.  All right.  Now, it is a little frustrating when you \r\n\r\n95\r\n00:13:10,533 --> 00:13:17,433\r\nfirst turn this on that it's just blank and you have to sit there and wait.  There's no status bar or anything like that.  You just wait.  All right.  So, \r\n\r\n96\r\n00:13:17,433 --> 00:13:28,599\r\nthere's a little trick you can use to see what's actually going on in the background  If you want, you can go go up here to logs and under logs if \r\n\r\n97\r\n00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:38,500\r\nyou switch in here from system log and scroll down to software update and service log, the service log for software update will show you \r\n\r\n98\r\n00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:46,266\r\nwhat's going on in the background and you can see here where it's retrieving a remote catalogue.  See how it's reaching out there and \r\n\r\n99\r\n00:13:46,266 --> 00:13:53,066\r\ngetting that catalogue of updates?  Yeah, mine's still running.  It's actually retrying something right now.  So it's reaching out and starting to \r\n\r\n100\r\n00:13:53,066 --> 00:14:00,032\r\nget those updates so you can watch the progress right here in the log files but if you don't go in the logs if you just stay right here in \r\n\r\n101\r\n00:14:00,033 --> 00:14:08,633\r\nsoftware update, the first time you come in it's literally just a blank screen and it sits there.  So I recommend you turn it on, turn on automatic \r\n\r\n102\r\n00:14:08,633 --> 00:14:16,133\r\ndownload if that's what you want, and then let it sit there and run overnight or whatever and that way by the time you come in the morning all the \r\n\r\n103\r\n00:14:16,133 --> 00:14:23,099\r\nupdates are downloaded and they're ready to go.  The updates can be pretty big.  Let me just sort by size here.  You'll see some of these updates, \r\n\r\n104\r\n00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:32,033\r\nlike the Mavericks Developer Previews that are out right now, right, the original Preview, Preview 2, 4, 5, you'll see each of those are about three \r\n\r\n105\r\n00:14:32,033 --> 00:14:40,699\r\nGB in size.  All the updates together end up being somewhere around 40 GB in size.  It's a lot of data that it's got to download so it's going \r\n\r\n106\r\n00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:49,133\r\nto take a while to get it.  All right.  There is also one other thing that is pretty important here.  By default, these are going to download right to \r\n\r\n107\r\n00:14:49,133 --> 00:14:57,499\r\nyour Macintosh HD, to the main hard drive for your system.  That's where the server app stores data by default.  All right.  If we want to \r\n\r\n108\r\n00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:06,933\r\nmove it somewhere else, like I've got this image storage drive sitting here that we were using in an earlier show to store our net boot images so \r\n\r\n109\r\n00:15:06,933 --> 00:15:15,099\r\nif I want to store my updates there instead, well, you don't really see the option here under software updates.  What happens is there's \r\n\r\n110\r\n00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:22,533\r\nactually a generic storage location setting that applies to the entire server app and that's what affects the software updates.  If you go up to \r\n\r\n111\r\n00:15:22,533 --> 00:15:28,399\r\nyour server ... so I'm just going to click on my server name ... you'll see some basic information about your server, the host name, \r\n\r\n112\r\n00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:36,333\r\nthe computer name, and you've got a settings tab, and if you go under settings, you'll see some information like turning on SSH or \r\n\r\n113\r\n00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:46,166\r\nwhatever and then right here ... service data.  That means the data for all these services that I'm running:  mail, contacts, calendar, software \r\n\r\n114\r\n00:15:46,166 --> 00:15:54,932\r\nupdate, all of them are currently being stored on Macintosh HD, my main hard drive.  If I want to move that to image storage, I can just hit edit \r\n\r\n115\r\n00:15:54,933 --> 00:16:03,966\r\nand I can choose the image storage right there so I'll choose my other drive and we'll hit choose.  All right.  Now, it's warning me I'm \r\n\r\n116\r\n00:16:03,966 --> 00:16:11,232\r\ngoing to have to move my service data so it's going to have to stop all of my services.  It's going to stop my mail server, my DNS, and so \r\n\r\n117\r\n00:16:11,233 --> 00:16:20,533\r\non, move the data to the new drive, and start it back up, again.  Because it's a move operation like this, it's better to do it before we turn on \r\n\r\n118\r\n00:16:20,533 --> 00:16:27,633\r\nsoftware update.  That way when it downloads the updates they just automatically go to the right place and we don't have to go and move \r\n\r\n119\r\n00:16:27,633 --> 00:16:34,833\r\nthem after the fact.  All right.  So this is a good setting to change early on.  I'm going to go ahead and change it right now and so there it \r\n\r\n120\r\n00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:42,766\r\ngoes.  It's gonna stop those services and move that data.  Now, most of my services are really small.  My mail server doesn't have any emails \r\n\r\n121\r\n00:16:42,766 --> 00:16:50,332\r\nin it.  My contacts and calendar are basically empty so this shouldn't take very long but in an enterprise environment where you've been \r\n\r\n122\r\n00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:57,233\r\nrunning for years this might be a lot of data and this move operation could take a while so this is something you'd schedule for after hours so that \r\n\r\n123\r\n00:16:57,233 --> 00:17:04,933\r\nyou wouldn't affect your end-users but when it's done I can go back to my software updates, I can check off that box to automatically \r\n\r\n124\r\n00:17:04,933 --> 00:17:11,533\r\ndownload the updates, and now when it downloads, it'll go up here to my image storage drive instead of being thrown under my main \r\n\r\n125\r\n00:17:11,533 --> 00:17:18,633\r\nhard drive, all right, so that's pretty useful.  There it goes moving data right now and if I browse to that drive, I can see it's making a \r\n\r\n126\r\n00:17:18,633 --> 00:17:27,266\r\nlibrary folder and there's server and here we can see each of the different services:  mail, messages, profile manager, web, software \r\n\r\n127\r\n00:17:27,266 --> 00:17:34,132\r\nupdate, all right.  Software update, that's where my updates are going to be going once they download.  Now, I haven't told it to download so \r\n\r\n128\r\n00:17:34,133 --> 00:17:41,333\r\nthere's not much in here yet, right, just my catalogue and the catalogue is the list of updates that I'm aware of and whether or not \r\n\r\n129\r\n00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:49,333\r\nthey've been approved.  All right.  So, at least I don't think it's downloaded anything, yet.  Let me see.  Oh, no, it actually has started to \r\n\r\n130\r\n00:17:49,333 --> 00:18:00,333\r\ndownload a few things so it's got a few pegged in there. It is at least aware that they exist, if it hasn't actually downloaded it, yet.  All right.  So \r\n\r\n131\r\n00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:09,433\r\nit's still moving.  I'll wait till it's done moving before we tinker with anything else.  Now, once we download the updates, if we were in \r\n\r\n132\r\n00:18:09,433 --> 00:18:16,499\r\nautomatic mode, then the updates are automatically approved, our clients would be able to download those updates right from us \r\n\r\n133\r\n00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:23,066\r\ninstead of going out to Apple and they'll get all the updates that are available but if we chose manual mode, right, which is what I chose, I \r\n\r\n134\r\n00:18:23,066 --> 00:18:30,532\r\nchose manual mode, then we can download the updates but they're just going to sit there.  They're going to sit there waiting for approval and \r\n\r\n135\r\n00:18:30,533 --> 00:18:38,533\r\nI have to go one by one and pick the updates that I want to approve for my end users.  Okay?  I might not want to approve them for my end \r\n\r\n136\r\n00:18:38,533 --> 00:18:45,699\r\nusers just yet.  I might want a testing period. So what I might do is take my pilot group and have my pilot group just get their updates right from \r\n\r\n137\r\n00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:54,066\r\nApple.  Right?  A new update comes out, they wait seven days, and then they apply the update right from Apple, okay, and after five days if they \r\n\r\n138\r\n00:18:54,066 --> 00:19:02,966\r\nsay hey, that update's good, then I come in here and I approve it and once it's approved now everybody else in my company will receive that \r\n\r\n139\r\n00:19:02,966 --> 00:19:11,566\r\nupdate so it's a pretty straightforward process just getting all of that set up.  So, it looks like it's moving my calendar data.  I'm kind of \r\n\r\n140\r\n00:19:11,566 --> 00:19:20,699\r\nsurprised it's taken as long as it has.  It's really not a lot of information but it is churning along.  Let's see.  What else can I talk about while I'm \r\n\r\n141\r\n00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:30,400\r\nwaiting ont his bar to slowly scroll across the screen?  All right, I mentioned we might have two groups, all right, a pilot group and then the \r\n\r\n142\r\n00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:39,366\r\nwhole rest of our company, all right.  That pilot group, how do we get them updates and not everybody else?  All right.  Well, by default in \r\n\r\n143\r\n00:19:39,366 --> 00:19:46,199\r\nthe software-based service we can't.  There's no way to discriminate between users in the software update service itself so what you'd \r\n\r\n144\r\n00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:54,300\r\nreally want to do is set up two software update servers, all right, one that supports your pilot group and one that supports the rest of your \r\n\r\n145\r\n00:19:54,300 --> 00:20:02,200\r\ncompany and on the pilot group that's the one were you have it download the updates, you'd wait your seven days for the cooling off period, \r\n\r\n146\r\n00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:08,200\r\nand then you'd approve the updates.  Then your pilot group would get their five days and if they said it was okay, you would just come over to \r\n\r\n147\r\n00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:14,933\r\nyour main software update server and approve it there.  So if you're going to do the pilot group and production environments, you would have \r\n\r\n148\r\n00:20:14,933 --> 00:20:22,033\r\ntwo software update servers, a pilot group server and a production server, all right, but if you're just trying to save on bandwidth, you do one \r\n\r\n149\r\n00:20:22,033 --> 00:20:28,599\r\nsoftware update server and you set it to automatic.  It downloads and approves, pushes out to the clients, and you are in business.  All \r\n\r\n150\r\n00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:34,966\r\nright, there we go.  It looks like it is all done so it has copied everything over to image storage and I'm just going to go down here to my \r\n\r\n151\r\n00:20:34,966 --> 00:20:42,266\r\nsoftware updates and I'm going to hit this checkmark to automatically download new updates so as it gets the new updates it is \r\n\r\n152\r\n00:20:42,266 --> 00:20:49,732\r\ngoing to download them and have them cached right here.  Now it's downloading a lot of stuff.  Look at these updates in here.  There will be \r\n\r\n153\r\n00:20:49,733 --> 00:20:58,366\r\nupdates for products you might not even use so as you look in here you'll see things like 27-inch iMac display update.  You might not have any \r\n\r\n154\r\n00:20:58,366 --> 00:21:06,032\r\n27-inch iMac's, but it's an update that is available.  You might get one in the future and so they download it and they make it right here.  \r\n\r\n155\r\n00:21:06,033 --> 00:21:12,999\r\nNow, some of the updates are really small.  That one is 68K in size.  It's no big deal there.  You might as well have it, right, but if you look at \r\n\r\n156\r\n00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:20,166\r\nsome of the other updates like if we go in and find ... well, you saw like the Mavericks developer previews.  They were several gigs in \r\n\r\n157\r\n00:21:20,166 --> 00:21:27,899\r\nsize so you might not want to to get those or approve those if you're not going to be using in your environment so you can choose to leave \r\n\r\n158\r\n00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:40,700\r\nthings off based on what you've got.  We'll find other updates like, well, this is the Mavericks exam.  My laptop, when I got it, it shipped with \r\n\r\n159\r\n00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:51,100\r\nMac OS 10.9.2.  That's what it came with.  Well, right now 10.9.4 is out so that's an update and I might want to apply that and so \r\n\r\n160\r\n00:21:51,100 --> 00:22:02,133\r\nsomewhere in here we can find that update.  I sorted alphabetically but sometimes it's still a bit of a hunting job to find it but Mac OS X \r\n\r\n161\r\n00:22:02,133 --> 00:22:14,299\r\nupdate 10.9.4 is in here somewhere.  I know I've seen it.  Well, shoot, apparently spotting it is going to be the challenge but it is in here \r\n\r\n162\r\n00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:20,966\r\nsomewhere so I could find it and I could choose to approve that and then it would roll out to my systems if I had tested it.  Now, the updates for \r\n\r\n163\r\n00:22:20,966 --> 00:22:27,932\r\nthe main operating system Apple does really good testing on, so it's pretty unlikely that we're going to have issues on those but it is still a \r\n\r\n164\r\n00:22:27,933 --> 00:22:35,466\r\ngood idea to go through the cooling off period, unless it's a security update.  Right?  You never want to have a known vulnerability on your \r\n\r\n165\r\n00:22:35,466 --> 00:22:43,699\r\nnetwork for a long period of time and you know, I've probably glanced over the update a few times, at this point.  Let's see, there are some \r\n\r\n166\r\n00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:51,166\r\nof the older ones and you'll see older updates as well as newer updates.  Sometimes if you have an older system it can't just jump to the latest \r\n\r\n167\r\n00:22:51,166 --> 00:22:58,699\r\nversion of Mac OS.  It might have to do a stepped upgrade where it moves through each version to get to the highest level and in those \r\n\r\n168\r\n00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:07,100\r\nscenarios you need to have the old versions.  That's why we see some of the older updates still in here.  You know, I know for a fact I saw \r\n\r\n169\r\n00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:15,600\r\nthat update earlier today, too.  I should've made a little note to remember exactly what it was called.  Oop, was that it?  Developer preview, \r\n\r\n170\r\n00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:27,100\r\nthere it is, OS X update 10.9.4.  So there it is so it's got the straight up 10.9.4. which would be for somebody who was already running 10.9.3 and \r\n\r\n171\r\n00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:36,700\r\nthen there's 10.9.4 combined, which is the one that contains each of the previous updates after 10.9 so notice the size difference.  One's 375 \r\n\r\n172\r\n00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:46,733\r\nmb.  One one is 958 MB, right.  It's almost a GB in size.  So those are there and as it refreshes it is going to go and download these and slowly fill \r\n\r\n173\r\n00:23:46,733 --> 00:23:54,466\r\nup my hard drive,right.  It won't, you know, do too bad.   All right, if you ever need to force it to update, you can hit your gear icon down here \r\n\r\n174\r\n00:23:54,466 --> 00:24:02,466\r\nand you've got check for updates.  You also have download to manually force that download to happen and you have download and enable if \r\n\r\n175\r\n00:24:02,466 --> 00:24:11,032\r\nyou're ready to go ahead and enable it.  So, I might want to take this 10.9.4 combined.  I'll take that guy, and I'm going to tell it to go ahead \r\n\r\n176\r\n00:24:11,033 --> 00:24:17,533\r\nand download it and I'll go ahead and download the other one, too, and so I'll see that they've changed to waiting over here.  That means that \r\n\r\n177\r\n00:24:17,533 --> 00:24:24,333\r\nit's going to reach out to the servers and attempt to download that as soon as it can.  If I want to check for new ones that have come out, I can \r\n\r\n178\r\n00:24:24,333 --> 00:24:31,766\r\njust hit the check for updates and in the background it's going to check for updates.  Again, if you want to really see the status of \r\n\r\n179\r\n00:24:31,766 --> 00:24:39,666\r\nwhat's going on, you've got to jump over to your logs.  If I go over to my logs and I get into that system update service log, I can see the \r\n\r\n180\r\n00:24:39,666 --> 00:24:46,399\r\ninformation here and I can see that it, you know, finished that copy stuff.  Actually, is that  ... yeah, that's the right log ... and so it's going to \r\n\r\n181\r\n00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:54,833\r\nreach out and start to download that and you can just kind of see that status update here as it happens.  All right, so we will give that a \r\n\r\n182\r\n00:24:54,833 --> 00:25:02,133\r\nmoment while it actually downloads those updates.  Now, I chose the download option so when it's downloaded it's going to be here but \r\n\r\n183\r\n00:25:02,133 --> 00:25:10,633\r\nit's not enabled, yet.  I'll still need to ... when I'm ready to roll it out to my clients ... I'll still need to come in and choose this enable option to \r\n\r\n184\r\n00:25:10,633 --> 00:25:18,633\r\nmake it available for them and if you need to, you can, you know, highlight more than one update at a time and come in and kick off that \r\n\r\n185\r\n00:25:18,633 --> 00:25:25,933\r\ndownload or download enable.  So, I didn't have automatically download turned on when I first turned this on so all these old ones didn't \r\n\r\n186\r\n00:25:25,933 --> 00:25:32,466\r\ndownload and they're not going to.  They're just going to sit there until I tell them to download.  Any new ones that come out at this point will \r\n\r\n187\r\n00:25:32,466 --> 00:25:40,899\r\nautomatically download.  They won't enable.  They'll just download and then it's up to me to enable them when I'm ready.  All right, so I'm \r\n\r\n188\r\n00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:47,400\r\ngoing to let that sit while it reaches out and downloads those servers.  Apple, you know, automatic updates like this they know that we're \r\n\r\n189\r\n00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:52,666\r\nnot sitting here waiting on them normally so they don't put them on the, you know, the highest end server.  Well, they are high-end \r\n\r\n190\r\n00:25:52,666 --> 00:25:59,332\r\nservers.  It's just they have a a lot of customers hitting them at once so they're not the fastest in the world but they don't have to be.  So it'll take \r\n\r\n191\r\n00:25:59,333 --> 00:26:07,499\r\na little while to download but it is about time to take a break anyway so we'll maybe pause and take a break while that happens.  We still \r\n\r\n192\r\n00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:13,433\r\nhaven't taken a look at the client side, either, so we still have a bit more there.  On the client side, they're still going straight out to Apple.  \r\n\r\n193\r\n00:26:13,433 --> 00:26:20,533\r\nWe've got to tell our clients to use this server so in the next segment we'll take a look at that ... how to get the clients checking with our server \r\n\r\n194\r\n00:26:20,533 --> 00:26:27,299\r\nbut I want to make sure I have a least one update approved before we do that so we can actually push it to the clients.  So, all right, so \r\n\r\n195\r\n00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:34,066\r\nlet's do this. We'll stop here and take a break and when we get back we'll have some updates and we'll get our client set up to pull them.  So \r\n\r\n196\r\n00:26:34,066 --> 00:26:36,799\r\nstay tuned.  We'll be back in a few.  [\r\n\r\n197\r\n00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:44,433\r\nMUSIC]  \r\n\r\n198\r\n00:26:44,433 --> 00:26:53,233\r\nAll right, welcome back everybody.  Well, as I get older, I find that my patience seems to get shorter so the updates are downloading just \r\n\r\n199\r\n00:26:53,233 --> 00:27:01,366\r\npainfully slow so I'm going just let them sit and kind of go about their business.  Basically, once the updates are downloaded.  You can come in \r\n\r\n200\r\n00:27:01,366 --> 00:27:11,732\r\nand you'll have that choice to take them and you can enable them, all right.  Until you choose to enable them, your employees or machines that \r\n\r\n201\r\n00:27:11,733 --> 00:27:18,233\r\nyou manage, whatever, are not going to be able to get that up update, all right.  You can also disable, which will be the default on mine \r\n\r\n202\r\n00:27:18,233 --> 00:27:25,766\r\nbecause I'm not automatically enabling them, and if we disable them, then the updates won't be available so you can see like I've got a lot of \r\n\r\n203\r\n00:27:25,766 --> 00:27:32,199\r\nthese here that are available to go and download and I can download or download them and enable.  If I had one that was already \r\n\r\n204\r\n00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:41,333\r\ndownloaded then I could switch it ... whoops, that's not what I wanted ... I could switch it and change it to a disabled state and say nah, don't \r\n\r\n205\r\n00:27:41,333 --> 00:27:47,999\r\nmake that one available to my end users, all right.  So, you have that control to stop an update from going out and with any of these \r\n\r\n206\r\n00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:55,100\r\nupdates that screen I brought up a second ago by accident, that's the detail screen.  If you highlight and update and press enter, it'll bring \r\n\r\n207\r\n00:27:55,100 --> 00:28:03,733\r\nyou the detail screen where it will tell you what that update is, it'll give you a little information on it, you can see the current status, and you can \r\n\r\n208\r\n00:28:03,733 --> 00:28:12,833\r\nchange its status right there on the individual update, if you want.  All right, so once our server is good, right, we do this.  We do the set up \r\n\r\n209\r\n00:28:12,833 --> 00:28:19,999\r\nhere and then we just let it sit and run overnight as it downloads and builds up its update database, right.  So it's copying all that here into \r\n\r\n210\r\n00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:29,100\r\nmy image storage and burying it down in here under the software update folder and, you know, as you drill down all the way into here into these \r\n\r\n211\r\n00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:36,600\r\nthousand folders, you eventually get to where it actually downloads the stuff and the updates are all kind of spread across these folders in \r\n\r\n212\r\n00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:43,533\r\ndifferent places.  I don't actually know what the number pattern there that Apple uses, but you'll see where the updates come and download and \r\n\r\n213\r\n00:28:43,533 --> 00:28:54,799\r\nsit right there on the drive.  All right, so my next step is to get my clients looking at this server instead of looking at Apple, all right.  There are \r\n\r\n214\r\n00:28:54,800 --> 00:29:03,466\r\ntwo ways to go about it and it kind of boils down to, you know, how much effort you want to put into this.  There are really three ways, I guess, if \r\n\r\n215\r\n00:29:03,466 --> 00:29:10,599\r\nyou think about it, but the two main ways are.  One, we can use the profile manager.  Remember from the Profile Manager episode \r\n\r\n216\r\n00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:18,533\r\nthat we had a lot of settings that we could configure on our machines.  One of those settings is to tell the machine to use our own \r\n\r\n217\r\n00:29:18,533 --> 00:29:30,033\r\nsoftware update server, all right, so we can point it at our own server, all right.  The second option is to manually point the clients at our server.  \r\n\r\n218\r\n00:29:30,033 --> 00:29:35,933\r\nUnfortunately, there is no graphical user interface for it so that means dropping the terminal and running a terminal command, you \r\n\r\n219\r\n00:29:35,933 --> 00:29:42,633\r\nknow, a little shell command to point that system to our own software update server, all right.  Now, I mentioned there's kind of a third \r\n\r\n220\r\n00:29:42,633 --> 00:29:51,366\r\nway.  The third way is I could take a machine and go ahead and get it set up to point to my own software update server and then make a net \r\n\r\n221\r\n00:29:51,366 --> 00:29:58,066\r\ninstall image out of it and then that way when I roll that net install image out to my network those machines will already be configured to \r\n\r\n222\r\n00:29:58,066 --> 00:30:04,566\r\nuse my software update server.   It's a good \ridea, if you're going to be doing a bulk deployment like that, all right.  So let's see \r\n\r\n223\r\n00:30:04,566 --> 00:30:14,032\r\ngetting some clients connected.  I'm going to fire \rup my profile manager and, here we go, so I'm just going to browse into my server to get into \r\n\r\n224\r\n00:30:14,033 --> 00:30:28,866\r\nthat web UI and the software updates ... it's a \rdevice setting.  It's a setting on that computer, not a setting on the users, and so we really \r\n\r\n225\r\n00:30:28,866 --> 00:30:35,999\r\nneed to set it onto a device group.  If you haven't \rcreated one already, you can whip one up or you can apply it to your individual device groups.  \r\n\r\n226\r\n00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:44,133\r\nWell, in the Profile Manager show we created \rsome device groups, student PCs and teacher PCs, so I can just go into these and I can set \r\n\r\n227\r\n00:30:44,133 --> 00:30:55,999\r\nthe information there so like I might go into my \rteacher PCs and go under settings and edit the settings and it's down towards the bottom \r\n\r\n228\r\n00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:04,000\r\nbecause it is not an iOS setting.  It is an OS X \rsetting.  If I scroll down to the bottom, I can go in there and find ... somewhere, there it is ... \r\n\r\n229\r\n00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:14,700\r\nsoftware update, all right, and inside of software \rupdate we can specify the URL to point to our server and they give you an example so really all \r\n\r\n230\r\n00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:22,100\r\nyou need to know is the server name, right, the name of that server to be able to get to it.  The reason you need this example is software \r\n\r\n231\r\n00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:30,200\r\nupdates are powered by a web server.  It's Apache Under the Hood, if that matters to you, but it is powered by Apache and it runs on a \r\n\r\n232\r\n00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:39,300\r\nnonstandard port.  A normal web server runs on port 80.  The software update server runs on port 8088 and so notice that port number right there \r\n\r\n233\r\n00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:48,533\r\n8088, all right, and then when we point to the server just pointing to the server isn't enough.  We need to point at a specific file, the software \r\n\r\n234\r\n00:31:48,533 --> 00:31:55,433\r\nupdate catalog.  The software update catalog is the list of all of the updates that been approved for me to download.  All right?  \r\n\r\n235\r\n00:31:55,433 --> 00:32:01,466\r\nThat's what we're really making in the server app is this catalog file and so notice the URL they give here \r\n\r\n236\r\n00:32:01,466 --> 00:32:15,432\r\nhttp://servername:8088/catalogs.sucatalog.  That's that software update catalog.  So all we have to do is type in the server we want them to \r\n\r\n237\r\n00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:31,099\r\nlook at and mine is called osx-server1.local:8088/catalogs.sucatalog.  I didn't attach a real domain to it.  All right.  Probably a \r\n\r\n238\r\n00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:40,466\r\ngood thing to memorize for the exam but there we go so I've got that punched in just like in their example and I'll go ahead and hit okay.  All right, \r\n\r\n239\r\n00:32:40,466 --> 00:32:51,099\r\nnow that setting is going to push out to my teacher PCs and now my teachers are going to start using this software update server so the \r\n\r\n240\r\n00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:59,133\r\nnext time this policy applies which should happen in the next few minutes because of our push notifications so when this applies now their \r\n\r\n241\r\n00:32:59,133 --> 00:33:05,566\r\nmachine will no longer go out to Apple  It'll come over to us.  Now, on their end they don't really notice a difference.  They don't visually see \r\n\r\n242\r\n00:33:05,566 --> 00:33:12,832\r\nanything different.  They just see doing updates like normal but it's being run through our server, all right, and I guess I should qualify that a little \r\n\r\n243\r\n00:33:12,833 --> 00:33:20,533\r\nbit because what if they're not able to get to this address.  If they can't get to the address, if they go home or somewhere else, well then they \r\n\r\n244\r\n00:33:20,533 --> 00:33:27,066\r\ncan't do the update so you generally want to make sure you use an Internet accessible address so that when they're at home or \r\n\r\n245\r\n00:33:27,066 --> 00:33:34,799\r\nwhatever they can still do software updates; otherwise, they'll have to wait till they get back to the office to do the updates.  All right, if I ever \r\n\r\n246\r\n00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:41,466\r\ndecide I want to put this system back to default, if I don't want to use my software update server any more, I just need to remove that payload, \r\n\r\n247\r\n00:33:41,466 --> 00:33:49,132\r\nright, remove that software update setting.  That will get that out of there and then they'll just default back to using Apple.  All right, that's how \r\n\r\n248\r\n00:33:49,133 --> 00:33:56,599\r\nwe do it with a profile manager but if you're just going to make it a part of your image, if you don't use the profile manager, then you might \r\n\r\n249\r\n00:33:56,600 --> 00:34:04,466\r\nnot want to go through this hassle.  You can just go and set it up on the machine itself, all right.  To do that we jump over to a client so I'll take \r\n\r\n250\r\n00:34:04,466 --> 00:34:16,932\r\nclient3 here, and we get into our terminal.  Now notice it's already telling me that there's some ... sorry that's the tour.  Eventually, it'll tell me \r\n\r\n251\r\n00:34:16,933 --> 00:34:25,266\r\nthat there are some updates cause it's going to go out and check, but I'm going to drop down into my terminal and let me make the font size \r\n\r\n252\r\n00:34:25,266 --> 00:34:36,132\r\nbigger on that because it's a little on the small side.  All right, so we're going to drop down into the terminal and we have a nice long command \r\n\r\n253\r\n00:34:36,133 --> 00:34:44,666\r\nhere and you don't have to memorize the full command for the exam but you should be at least where you can recognize it so if you're \r\n\r\n254\r\n00:34:44,666 --> 00:34:50,132\r\nlooking at a series of answers and you see this command that you can recognize what's the right one.  You're not going to have to type out \r\n\r\n255\r\n00:34:50,133 --> 00:34:57,233\r\nthe command yourself but you may need to be able to visually recognize it so it's it's a good idea.  So the command that we want to run is \r\n\r\n256\r\n00:34:57,233 --> 00:35:07,233\r\nthe ... it's kind of a long one ... it's defaults right, and so that's a command that allows us to change defaults on the system.  It's really \r\n\r\n257\r\n00:35:07,233 --> 00:35:13,533\r\nallowing us to modify system preferences.  Right?  So you can modify any system preference with this but we're going to use it \r\n\r\n258\r\n00:35:13,533 --> 00:35:21,266\r\nbecause we need to modify a system preference that we don't have a GUI for so this is really the only command that's available for us to use and \r\n\r\n259\r\n00:35:21,266 --> 00:35:40,466\r\nso we're going to say defaultsright/library/preferences/com.apple.softwareupdatecatalogurl and then in quotes ... the \r\n\r\n260\r\n00:35:40,466 --> 00:35:50,232\r\nquotes are important ... we specify the server that we're going to use.  So, I'll just punch that in http://\r\n\r\n261\r\n00:35:50,233 --> 00:36:08,866\r\nosx-server1.local:8088/\rcatalogs ...  let's see, uh, er I'm sorry, it's a ...  shoot, it's catalog, there we go, .sucatalog.  Let \r\n\r\n262\r\n00:36:08,866 --> 00:36:18,899\r\nme just make sure I got that right.  There.  Okay.  So, we punch that in, \rremember to close our quotes, then we hit enter, \r\n\r\n263\r\n00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:28,766\r\nand there we go.  Could not write domain.  Oh, shoot, so I forgot to do the pseudo to get \relevated privileges when I did that so I'm just \r\n\r\n264\r\n00:36:28,766 --> 00:36:35,899\r\ngoing to throw in pseudo or you can remember the short cut that Dave mentioned in the chat room the other day, which is to use the double \r\n\r\n265\r\n00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:42,400\r\nexclamation points so that will run that previous command.  I got to learn something new on the show.  So, we can run that and there it goes \r\n\r\n266\r\n00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:50,300\r\nreaching out.  I'll have to punch in my super secret password and then it's going to write that setting, all right.  So we just modified a system \r\n\r\n267\r\n00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:58,600\r\npreference that we don't normally have access to, right.  It's not in the GUI but now we've changed it and when my system goes to do a \r\n\r\n268\r\n00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:04,800\r\nsoftware update, assuming I didn't have any typos.  That looked spelled weird for a second there, but no it looks right.  All right, assuming \r\n\r\n269\r\n00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:12,500\r\nwe don't have any typos when it goes to do an update it's going to reach out to the server, my server, and look for this catalog file right here, \r\n\r\n270\r\n00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:21,000\r\nthe system update catalog, and when it finds it, hopefully, it finds it, when it finds it that will tell it what updates are available and where it can get \r\n\r\n271\r\n00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:27,700\r\nthe updates from and my server is going to tell it the updates are available for download right there from that server so instead of reaching out \r\n\r\n272\r\n00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:34,033\r\nto the Internet or reaching out to Apple, I'll just reach over to this server right here on my own network and get the update from there.  That's \r\n\r\n273\r\n00:37:34,033 --> 00:37:40,099\r\nwhere our bandwidth saving comes in and then I can only see the updates that have been approved on the server.  That's where our control \r\n\r\n274\r\n00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:48,966\r\nis.  Right?  Those are the two big things we get via software update.  All right?  Now, that's set.  That's turned on on this machine.  If I were to go \r\n\r\n275\r\n00:37:48,966 --> 00:38:02,099\r\ninto my app store and click on updates, instead of going out to Apple it's now going to go out to my server.  Right.  Well, my system, if I go in \r\n\r\n276\r\n00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:12,500\r\nhere and I go about this Mac, I can see that I'm running 10.9.2.  I know for a fact 10.9.4 is out.  I'm  running it on my laptop right now.  All right?  \r\n\r\n277\r\n00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:24,200\r\nSo I know there's an update but here in the app store ... oh, error occurred, can't load data ... you know. I have seen this before.  In the \r\n\r\n278\r\n00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:35,766\r\nexample here in profile manager, let me show you guys this.  Here we go.  See the example here, oh it, shoot, it's catalogues with an s so I \r\n\r\n279\r\n00:38:35,766 --> 00:38:48,232\r\nmust have a typo, catalogs.sucatalog.  I think I put catalog without an s.  So let me just jump over here and fix that. Yeah, if you have a typo, \r\n\r\n280\r\n00:38:48,233 --> 00:38:58,099\r\nit doesn't work very well, so let me just fix that there.  All right, and we'll go and do this, again.  All right, so I'm going to go back into my app \r\n\r\n281\r\n00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:08,733\r\nstore and I'm going to go into updates, and it's telling me no updates are available.  I know 10.9.4 is available, but it's not showing up here.  \r\n\r\n282\r\n00:39:08,733 --> 00:39:14,433\r\nIn fact, no updates are showing up here and that's because I haven't finished downloading the updates on the other side and even if they were \r\n\r\n283\r\n00:39:14,433 --> 00:39:21,699\r\ndone downloading I haven't enabled them.  Right?  I haven't approved the updates in my system so I'm not gonna see any updates that \r\n\r\n284\r\n00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:31,800\r\nare available.  All right?  Now, that address right there.  In my case I just happen to have a typo in it.  So that's what the problem was and I fixed \r\n\r\n285\r\n00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:42,233\r\nthat typo.  If you're running an older version of the server app, I have seen where that address is a little bit different so if you still continue to \r\n\r\n286\r\n00:39:42,233 --> 00:39:49,666\r\nget an error, mine's fine now, but if you still continue to get an error, on some of the older systems it's index.sucatalog.  I've seen that on \r\n\r\n287\r\n00:39:49,666 --> 00:39:59,599\r\nsome of the older ones but on the newer ones catalogs.sucatalog.  That will take care of it.  All right, so that's working and that's it via the app \r\n\r\n288\r\n00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:12,000\r\nstore.  If I go and go into my Apple menu in system preferences and I go into my app store preferences in here, all right, I see my automatic \r\n\r\n289\r\n00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:18,800\r\nupdates that are turned on that are set to reach out to the server and if I hit check now, it just takes you into the same place and it checks \r\n\r\n290\r\n00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:25,433\r\nwith the server.  So the end user, nothing different.  Nothing different from what they're used to.  It reaches out and it gets the updates.  \r\n\r\n291\r\n00:40:25,433 --> 00:40:34,599\r\nIt's just now being controlled by our server.  All right?  If I want to give this client the ability to go back to Apple again, well, if I use the profile \r\n\r\n292\r\n00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:42,166\r\nmanager then what I would do is I would remove that setting from the profile manager.  I would remove that payload but if we set it from the \r\n\r\n293\r\n00:40:42,166 --> 00:40:51,132\r\ncommand line like this, we need to modify that command a little bit and what we do is I'm just going to delete that value, delete the URL, and \r\n\r\n294\r\n00:40:51,133 --> 00:41:03,133\r\nI'm to change it from defaults right to defaults delete so instead of writing a setting I'm going to delete the setting.  There.  So now I'm saying \r\n\r\n295\r\n00:41:03,133 --> 00:41:16,533\r\npseudodefaultsdelete/library/preferences/com.apple.softwareupdate catalogURL.  I'm basically blanking out the catalog URL.  All right?  When \r\n\r\n296\r\n00:41:16,533 --> 00:41:28,833\r\nwe blank out that catalog URL it's going to go back to using Apple so if I fire up my app store now and I click on my updates, it's going to \r\n\r\n297\r\n00:41:28,833 --> 00:41:36,833\r\nreach out to Apple, any moment now, assuming I have Internet access [LAUGHTER] and it will tell me the updates that are available, which \r\n\r\n298\r\n00:41:36,833 --> 00:41:46,433\r\nshould include the 10.9.4 update.  There we go.  So I just had to be patient.  So I can see right here there's several updates that are available \r\n\r\n299\r\n00:41:46,433 --> 00:41:56,166\r\nincluding the OS X update combined 10.9.4 so there it is and I can see all the different things that are in there.  So I knew that update was \r\n\r\n300\r\n00:41:56,166 --> 00:42:07,166\r\navailable.  I see it now because I'm reaching out directly to Apple, so cool stuff there that we can control the updates that roll out for our system.  \r\n\r\n301\r\n00:42:07,166 --> 00:42:16,699\r\nAll right.  You know, I'm going to go check on the status of my server.  Let's see how it's going.  Oh, yeah, it's still taking forever.  It's \r\n\r\n302\r\n00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:23,366\r\ndownloading the Chinese word list update.  That's good ... definitely need that one.  [LAUGHTER]  You know.  Keep that in mind.  \r\n\r\n303\r\n00:42:23,366 --> 00:42:29,866\r\nNot all the updates apply in your environment, right, and that's because Apple has to support computers all over the world.  You don't have to \r\n\r\n304\r\n00:42:29,866 --> 00:42:37,132\r\ndownload the ones that don't apply so if you're short on space or whatever you can try and conserve that way.  All right, well, that's pretty \r\n\r\n305\r\n00:42:37,133 --> 00:42:43,933\r\nmuch it for software updates.  It's not very hard to configure.  You just turn it on.  I do recommend you change the storage location \r\n\r\n306\r\n00:42:43,933 --> 00:42:52,333\r\nbefore turning it on rather than after.  It'll make that move go a lot quicker and then you just approve the updates that you want to approve.  \r\n\r\n307\r\n00:42:52,333 --> 00:42:58,733\r\nKeep in mind you can do more than one at once by holding your shift key and highlighting but you know really you should test, make sure \r\n\r\n308\r\n00:42:58,733 --> 00:43:05,399\r\nthey work in your environment, and then deploy them.  To deploy one you just highlight it and then you choose enable, right.  You click on the \r\n\r\n309\r\n00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:12,700\r\ngear and hit enable or hit command E and that'll enable it and then the next time the client checks in they'll download that update and \r\n\r\n310\r\n00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:22,000\r\nthey'll download from you instead of going to the internet.  All right, well, that in a nutshell is software update, not too terribly crazy.  The next \r\n\r\n311\r\n00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:30,200\r\nthing that we're going to talk about is software caching, which also applies to updates so they're very, very related but in the book they \r\n\r\n312\r\n00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:37,366\r\nbreak it up into two separate chapters so at this point we're done with that first section, the section on software updates, and what we'll do \r\n\r\n313\r\n00:43:37,366 --> 00:43:44,266\r\nis we'll take a little break and when we get back we'll dive into the caching side and get a chance to see how that works, kind of what we do there \r\n\r\n314\r\n00:43:44,266 --> 00:43:51,232\r\nand how we can use the caching server to optimize our Internet bandwidth.  So stay tuned.  We'll be back after this.  \r\n\r\n315\r\n00:43:51,233 --> 00:43:58,433\r\n[MUSIC]  \r\n\r\n316\r\n00:43:58,433 --> 00:44:06,166\r\nAll right, welcome back everybody.  So, in the last segment we're going to take a look at caching.  The caching server that is a part of the \r\n\r\n317\r\n00:44:06,166 --> 00:44:12,099\r\nserver app.  All right, now one of the big advantages of a software update that I just talked about a moment ago was we can have \r\n\r\n318\r\n00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:19,466\r\none server download all the updates and then when our clients go to do an update instead of going out to the Internet they download it right \r\n\r\n319\r\n00:44:19,466 --> 00:44:29,332\r\nfrom the server so not using your your Internet bandwidth.  All right?  The caching server works very similar.  All right?  The caching server looks \r\n\r\n320\r\n00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:35,966\r\nfor downloads that are coming from Apple and I'm talking about not just software updates.  Software updates are included, but also app \r\n\r\n321\r\n00:44:35,966 --> 00:44:46,299\r\npurchases, iTunes U, book downloads, the firmware updates, any of the various recovery software, all that stuff that you download from \r\n\r\n322\r\n00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:55,700\r\nApple, from any of Apple's servers, really it's the whole thing on Apple's set of servers.  It will cache and store a copy and the next time a \r\n\r\n323\r\n00:44:55,700 --> 00:45:04,466\r\nclient tries to go out and get that same file instead of going out to Apple it'll pull it right from your cache, very, very cool, all right.  There a \r\n\r\n324\r\n00:45:04,466 --> 00:45:11,399\r\ncouple of neat things about this.  The neatest thing is how easy it is to set up.  We'll see that here in just a moment.  Now, you might be \r\n\r\n325\r\n00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:17,533\r\nasking yourself wait a minute, Don, this really sounds a lot like software update.  Right?  Well, software update downloads stuff and holds the \r\n\r\n326\r\n00:45:17,533 --> 00:45:26,499\r\nupdates.  Isn't that the same thing?  Well, there are a few little differences we need to be aware of.  Difference number one is what gets cached.  \r\n\r\n327\r\n00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:37,333\r\nThe software update just caches updates.  It doesn't cache full products so things like apps purchased from the app store, your books, \r\n\r\n328\r\n00:45:37,333 --> 00:45:45,166\r\nthose things, those are full products.  It does cache those.  All right?  So it's only caching updates and that's it.  The caching server, on the \r\n\r\n329\r\n00:45:45,166 --> 00:45:52,766\r\nother hand, will cache anything, full apps, whatever, pretty much anything from Apple.  It'll cache that and hold onto it.  All right?  So, it's \r\n\r\n330\r\n00:45:52,766 --> 00:46:03,966\r\nable to cache a lot more than what the software update server will do.  All right?  The other thing is it caches on demand so it doesn't do what \r\n\r\n331\r\n00:46:03,966 --> 00:46:10,866\r\nsoftware updates is doing on my machine right now.  My machine is still trying to download 771 different updates down to the system.  See, it's \r\n\r\n332\r\n00:46:10,866 --> 00:46:21,499\r\ngot 771 and so it's going to download all of those whether I need them or not.   I might not have any machines that are using the iAd \r\n\r\n333\r\n00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:30,133\r\nProducer, right, but I'm about to download that update and that'll be 313 MB of storage on my system and I'm not going to run that utility, \r\n\r\n334\r\n00:46:30,133 --> 00:46:39,233\r\nokay, but with the caching server the first time somebody uses it, yeah, it will cache it and then it will be available for somebody else.  All right?  \r\n\r\n335\r\n00:46:39,233 --> 00:46:46,266\r\nSo, the caching server is on demand  That means it is more efficient storage wise.  The software update server can be a little bit wasteful \r\n\r\n336\r\n00:46:46,266 --> 00:46:54,799\r\nbecause of those updates we don't need.  The caching server isn't.  All right?  The other thing is the software update server just works for OS X.  \r\n\r\n337\r\n00:46:54,800 --> 00:47:04,533\r\nIt is just the OS X Mac OS updates that we download there but the caching server will cache for both OS X and iOS so it will cache for iPads \r\n\r\n338\r\n00:47:04,533 --> 00:47:13,733\r\nand iPhones, also, so a little more powerful than what you get with just a desktop, all right, or with just software updates.  Now, some of the \r\n\r\n339\r\n00:47:13,733 --> 00:47:20,733\r\nother things we need to be aware of with the caching server, it works a little bit more differently than the software update side.  With \r\n\r\n340\r\n00:47:20,733 --> 00:47:27,033\r\nthe software update side, we had to put in a URL, right.  We had to tell the clients where to look and we did that with either profile manager \r\n\r\n341\r\n00:47:27,033 --> 00:47:36,233\r\nor a terminal command to put it in.  The caching server, we don't have to do that.  It's automatic.  It's automagic, right.  It's one of those things \r\n\r\n342\r\n00:47:36,233 --> 00:47:43,799\r\nthat just works.  We turn it on and it works.  Here's how it happens.  Basically, and this is right out of the book so if you download the book \r\n\r\n343\r\n00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:51,600\r\nfrom Apple's site, you'll see this exact diagram and the way it works is most organizations have a bunch of computers, right, laptops, iPhones, \r\n\r\n344\r\n00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:59,166\r\niPads, whatever they are that's on your network, all right, and they go out through some kind of a router and they go out to the Internet and out on \r\n\r\n345\r\n00:47:59,166 --> 00:48:07,766\r\nthe Internet is Apple, right, so they're all reaching out to Apple.  Well, most organizations do not have enough public IP addresses to give \r\n\r\n346\r\n00:48:07,766 --> 00:48:15,566\r\nall these machines a public IP so they typically use network address translation or NAT so that all of these machines when they go out to the \r\n\r\n347\r\n00:48:15,566 --> 00:48:24,366\r\nInternet they look like they have the same IP address.  They look like they're using that same address, whatever address you have, right.  If \r\n\r\n348\r\n00:48:24,366 --> 00:48:32,966\r\nyou ever want to find out you can just fire up a web browser and go to like whatismyip.com or something like that so, like, if I take my server \r\n\r\n349\r\n00:48:32,966 --> 00:48:45,532\r\nhere, this is my server, and if I go to whatismyip.com, I can see here is my IP, 209.251.159.184.  That's a lot of advertisements \r\n\r\n350\r\n00:48:45,533 --> 00:48:57,533\r\non that one.  Let's try a different site on our client.  So on my client here I can go to ... we'll use ipmonkey, so I'll go to ipmonkey.com and I \r\n\r\n351\r\n00:48:57,533 --> 00:49:08,233\r\ncan see my IP 209.251.159.184.  Maybe you don't like monkeys.  If that's the case, we can try ipchicken, instead.  We'll go the whole \r\n\r\n352\r\n00:49:08,233 --> 00:49:16,633\r\ngamut, right, we'll see how many barnyard animals we can try.  So, we'll ipchicken on this one and there's my address.  I went to three \r\n\r\n353\r\n00:49:16,633 --> 00:49:23,166\r\ndifferent computers.  They all have the same public IP and that's because they're all passing through the same router on their way out to the \r\n\r\n354\r\n00:49:23,166 --> 00:49:32,232\r\nInternet so on Apple's side they see these clients all coming in with same address.  All right.  Well, when you configure a caching server .\r\n\r\n355\r\n00:49:32,233 --> 00:49:42,666\r\n.. see here they've got this caching server ... the caching server reaches out to Apple and Apple sees it and says ... Oh look, you have the same \r\n\r\n356\r\n00:49:42,666 --> 00:49:50,299\r\nIP address as all these other guys.  Let me tell all those other guys to start using you ... and that's what happens.  These clients will \r\n\r\n357\r\n00:49:50,300 --> 00:50:00,166\r\nautomatically start to use your local caching server because they have the same IP address.  All right?  You know, Dave in our chat room just \r\n\r\n358\r\n00:50:00,166 --> 00:50:08,032\r\nposted a message.  I didn't know you could do that.  Apparently, in Google if you just type in what is my IP ... I've gotta try that.  So, we'll fire \r\n\r\n359\r\n00:50:08,033 --> 00:50:17,933\r\nup Google and do what is my IP and sure enough, look at that, even Google.  They're pretty smart people.  All right, so that's how the \r\n\r\n360\r\n00:50:17,933 --> 00:50:27,499\r\ncaching server works.  If it's on the same IP address as you, you know the same public IP, then you will automatically start to use it without \r\n\r\n361\r\n00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:35,033\r\nchanging anything.  You don't have to change any setting on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac OS device.  It'll just automatically start to do it.   \r\n\r\n362\r\n00:50:35,033 --> 00:50:44,399\r\nLike magic.  Even in really complex environments you might have multiple networks like this, okay.  See how here they've got \r\n\r\n363\r\n00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:54,766\r\nmultiple networks but if your multiple networks ... here's the 10.0.1 network over here and the 10.0.2 network over here and they've got the \r\n\r\n364\r\n00:50:54,766 --> 00:51:05,166\r\ncaching server on 10.01 and no caching server over here.  Well, as long as they go out and get Natted to the same address clients on the\r\n\r\n365\r\n00:51:05,166 --> 00:51:14,966\r\nsecond subnet will use the caching server on the first subnet.  They will reach over and use it so you really get some good flexibility there and \r\n\r\n366\r\n00:51:14,966 --> 00:51:22,566\r\nyou don't have to configure it.  I mean. how easy is that?  We just turn on the caching server and we apply a few configuration changes there but \r\n\r\n367\r\n00:51:22,566 --> 00:51:31,666\r\nyou don't do anything on the clients.  They just automatically start to use it.  All right.  The only negative is on the caching server it will cash \r\n\r\n368\r\n00:51:31,666 --> 00:51:39,132\r\nsoftware updates so you might not need a software update server, right, but the software update server allows us to block updates.  \r\n\r\n369\r\n00:51:39,133 --> 00:51:45,699\r\nRight?  We manually approve or disable updates.  It's our choice.  Right?  We can go through and do that.  On the caching server you \r\n\r\n370\r\n00:51:45,700 --> 00:51:54,300\r\ncan't.  It's all automatic.  You have no control over what gets cached and what doesn't so if you need to control which updates are getting \r\n\r\n371\r\n00:51:54,300 --> 00:52:02,266\r\napplied and which ones aren't, software update is the way for you but if you're just trying to save bandwidth, the caching server's a better option \r\n\r\n372\r\n00:52:02,266 --> 00:52:09,799\r\nbecause it's far easier and it's an automatic configuration.  All right.  Another thing to be aware of, especially for the exam, is what if I \r\n\r\n373\r\n00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:17,333\r\nhave my iPad and it's at the, well, and let me use the laptop as an example, so my Mac OS laptop is at the office and it's hitting that caching \r\n\r\n374\r\n00:52:17,333 --> 00:52:26,266\r\nserver, right, and then I leave the office and I go home.  Well, when I go home I no longer have the same IP address as I did at work and so \r\n\r\n375\r\n00:52:26,266 --> 00:52:35,132\r\nnow I'm just going to go straight to Apple and not use a caching server.  That's automatic.  All right.  With software updates, with the software \r\n\r\n376\r\n00:52:35,133 --> 00:52:42,533\r\nupdate server, we can still configure the machine to use that URL and even when you're at home it'll still reach to your office to get the updates \r\n\r\n377\r\n00:52:42,533 --> 00:52:48,499\r\nfrom there and that's important because you need to control what updates they get so definitely a difference in functionality.  It's pretty \r\n\r\n378\r\n00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:56,066\r\nimportant.  All right, but the key thing to remember is how automatic this is.  We don't have to set it up.  It just runs and that's it.  All \r\n\r\n379\r\n00:52:56,066 --> 00:53:03,632\r\nright.  So, let's take a look at the server side and what we need to get configured there.  All right?  So, on my server I'm just going to go back into \r\n\r\n380\r\n00:53:03,633 --> 00:53:10,566\r\nmy server app and on the left side here this is not under advanced.  I think almost everything we've done was under advanced but just under \r\n\r\n381\r\n00:53:10,566 --> 00:53:18,732\r\nour regular services we have caching and we can choose caching and here's our settings.  It's not turned on by default and there's not really a \r\n\r\n382\r\n00:53:18,733 --> 00:53:27,666\r\nwhole lot that we configure.  Notice the different items here.  First off, the volume, where do I want to store the cache.  I need to pick a hard \r\n\r\n383\r\n00:53:27,666 --> 00:53:35,266\r\ndrive to put that cache on.  It defaults to your main hard drive where your operating system is.  I want to change that.  I'm going to move that to \r\n\r\n384\r\n00:53:35,266 --> 00:53:43,566\r\nmy image storage.  All right, so I'm going to put it over there and now I'll have a new cache location.  All right?  I haven't cached anything so \r\n\r\n385\r\n00:53:43,566 --> 00:53:53,132\r\nit's going to move real fast.  Then we can adjust how much space is used for the cache.  The default is unlimited.  That means it can use the \r\n\r\n386\r\n00:53:53,133 --> 00:54:03,033\r\nentire hard drive, all right, but there is a special little caveat that they don't really show here on the screen.  Even if you choose unlimited, the \r\n\r\n387\r\n00:54:03,033 --> 00:54:13,033\r\ncaching server will never use your entire hard drive.  All right?  It will use all the way until you have 25 GB of free space.  All right?  So if I \r\n\r\n388\r\n00:54:13,033 --> 00:54:23,799\r\nchoose a 1 TB drive, or I think mine's100 GB, so it's 100 GB, so if I go to unlimited, it can't actually use all 100 GB.  It's only can use 75 \r\n\r\n389\r\n00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:33,366\r\nGB of space so it'll leave 25 GB free at the end of the drive.  That's the ingrained little boundary that it has that it hits and it stops.  All right.  So \r\n\r\n390\r\n00:54:33,366 --> 00:54:40,266\r\nno matter what size you pick and no matter how much stuff you cache it will always make sure you have 25 GB free.  Now when it hits that limit \r\n\r\n391\r\n00:54:40,266 --> 00:54:48,266\r\nthat doesn't mean it stops working.  What it does is it deletes old stuff to make room for new stuff and that way it's caching things that are \r\n\r\n392\r\n00:54:48,266 --> 00:54:54,632\r\nbeing frequently and currently used so things that haven't been accessed in a while will get deleted and bumped off the bottom to make \r\n\r\n393\r\n00:54:54,633 --> 00:55:02,233\r\nroom for new stuff.  So you don't necessarily need a gigantic cache.  You don't need a 14 TB caching server.  You may choose to have \r\n\r\n394\r\n00:55:02,233 --> 00:55:08,133\r\nsomething that is much smaller because it's really just all the updates that are out there and the other software that we're pulling from Apple.  \r\n\r\n395\r\n00:55:08,133 --> 00:55:15,633\r\nIt's generally not going to be too terribly large because it's got to fit on your laptop and so if you think about like the total bulk of software \r\n\r\n396\r\n00:55:15,633 --> 00:55:24,133\r\nyou can install on a laptop isn't really going to exceed maybe 500 GB tops so, you know, you've got tons of room for that.  So specify that \r\n\r\n397\r\n00:55:24,133 --> 00:55:30,433\r\nsize or, you know, where you want it stored and the amount of space you want it to use.  Now, my image storage, that was where I was putting \r\n\r\n398\r\n00:55:30,433 --> 00:55:37,399\r\nmy software update server, also, and some other things so I probably don't want to go unlimited.  I may cap it down here at something lower, like \r\n\r\n399\r\n00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:45,900\r\n45 GB, all right, so I'll set it to 45 GB.  There should always be 25 GB of empty space available, unless my other services start \r\n\r\n400\r\n00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:54,333\r\nconsuming space then different things can happen but it's just going to stop here at 45 GB.  All right. It's also got an entry here to say only \r\n\r\n401\r\n00:55:54,333 --> 00:56:02,299\r\ncache content for local networks.  For most people that doesn't apply.  That applies when we talk about this scenario here;  where the \r\n\r\n402\r\n00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:11,600\r\ncaching server is local to this network on the left, it is not local to this network on the right and so we can tell it ... hey, even though the \r\n\r\n403\r\n00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:17,600\r\nother people might reach out to us, we're not going to provide cache services to them.  We'll still send them back to Apple, so you can set \r\n\r\n404\r\n00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:27,000\r\nthat, if you choose.  All right, and then you see your cache information right here, how much data is in cache.  You'll see Mac apps, iOS \r\n\r\n405\r\n00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:36,200\r\napps, books, and other so that's the information that's being consumed by my cache right now.  Okay, now what about my other systems?  My \r\n\r\n406\r\n00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:43,566\r\nother systems are out there doing updates or whatever.  Are they using the cache server?  Well, they should.  It's automatic.  When I turn it \r\n\r\n407\r\n00:56:43,566 --> 00:56:52,199\r\non right here ... I guess that helps.  I didn't turn it on ... When I turn it on my caching server just reached out to Apple and it said hey Apple I'm a \r\n\r\n408\r\n00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:58,733\r\ncaching server and I'm here,all right, and it logged it, Apple made a record of it, and they know what IP address it is sitting at.  So now \r\n\r\n409\r\n00:56:58,733 --> 00:57:08,699\r\nit's sitting here and it's ready to cache.  All right.  If I switch over to a client and I go and do like these updates right here, so I'm going to go \r\n\r\n410\r\n00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:15,966\r\nahead and do one of these updates.  I wish it would tell me the size so I could tell which one was the the biggest but I'll do this 10.9.4 update.  \r\n\r\n411\r\n00:57:15,966 --> 00:57:25,132\r\nSo I'm going to go ahead and do it, yeah, go ahead.  I've got to restart?  I should've picked an easier update.  Well, any how.  [LAUGHTER]  \r\n\r\n412\r\n00:57:25,133 --> 00:57:32,033\r\nSo, it's going to reach out and download this update.  Oh, shoot, it's already downloaded it.  That's what it was talking about, so it's already \r\n\r\n413\r\n00:57:32,033 --> 00:57:38,033\r\ndownloaded that update.  Let me see if I can find an update that I haven't downloaded, yet, but basically the next time we go to download an \r\n\r\n414\r\n00:57:38,033 --> 00:57:47,633\r\nupdate or a purchase or something I can't really do a purchase because I'm not signed in.  You know, I wonder, if it will let me do a, like a, free \r\n\r\n415\r\n00:57:47,633 --> 00:58:03,133\r\napp?  Uhm ... what's something that's free?  I'm just going to try this little free game here.  Aw, you've gotta have an Apple ID, great.  Uhm, well, \r\n\r\n416\r\n00:58:03,133 --> 00:58:15,699\r\nyou know, I guess I could log in with our lab.  We'll go crazy.  All right, so I'm going to reach out and download this app ... [LAUGHTER] ... \r\n\r\n417\r\n00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:29,466\r\nafter I, you know, sign my licensing agreement and all that stuff, and it's going to reach out.  It's going to download the app from the app store \r\n\r\n418\r\n00:58:29,466 --> 00:58:39,132\r\nand the caching server should automatically cache it, assuming I can get through all of this.  I have to put in a credit card?  All right, well, this \r\n\r\n419\r\n00:58:39,133 --> 00:58:51,333\r\nis not going to end well ... [LAUGHTER] ... or do they just want a phone number.  Let's see what I can get away with here as far as information I \r\n\r\n420\r\n00:58:51,333 --> 00:59:06,066\r\nprovide to them.  Is that enough?  A title is required.  I gotta know my title; otherwise, we won't get anywhere, and they've got to know a \r\n\r\n421\r\n00:59:06,066 --> 00:59:16,832\r\ncredit card.  All right, well, so let me go back to the idea of updates.  So, let's see if there's an update that I haven't downloaded.  Yeah, it's \r\n\r\n422\r\n00:59:16,833 --> 00:59:22,733\r\nalready downloaded it, shoot.  So, if an update comes out or if I go and download an app, though, it will get cached and it will get stored \r\n\r\n423\r\n00:59:22,733 --> 00:59:29,999\r\non that other system and, you know, I wish I didn't have to put in a credit card there or I would go ahead and do it but but it's going to get it and \r\n\r\n424\r\n00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:36,833\r\nyou'll just see it reflected right here.  You'll start to see that cache fill up with the various things that you've, you know, downloaded or obtained.  \r\n\r\n425\r\n00:59:36,833 --> 00:59:51,399\r\nActually, you know, I think if I download QuickTime, I think that'll trigger it. Eh, no, they're going to tell me that I can get it, yeah, \r\n\r\n426\r\n00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:59,966\r\nthat way.  All right, well, I guess I could stop, yeah, you know, maybe we'll do that.  Jason, let's do this.  Let's take a little pause.  \r\n\r\n427\r\n00:59:59,966 --> 01:00:06,132\r\nObviously, I don't want to punch in a credit card live on the show.  So, let's take a pause, and I'll punch a  credit card in there and then I'll just \r\n\r\n428\r\n01:00:06,133 --> 01:00:11,699\r\ndownload an app so that we can see a good cache.  I want to, you know, see that it's there and then how to flush the cache to get it empty.  \r\n\r\n429\r\n01:00:11,700 --> 01:00:18,100\r\nSo let's just take a quick pause, I'll punch that data in there, and then we'll get that app purchased.  So stay tuned.  I'll be back in just a \r\n\r\n430\r\n01:00:18,100 --> 01:00:19,600\r\nsecond.  [\r\n\r\n431\r\n01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:26,500\r\nMUSIC]  \r\n\r\n432\r\n01:00:26,500 --> 01:00:34,700\r\nAll right, sorry about that.  I just didn't want to punch in credit card data live on the show.  I'm am not that security naïve.  [LAUGHTER]  So, \r\n\r\n433\r\n01:00:34,700 --> 01:00:40,666\r\nall right, so during the break I went ahead and did that and you know, I logged in and I just logged in with our studio account.  They gave \r\n\r\n434\r\n01:00:40,666 --> 01:00:47,699\r\nme the ability to download like the server and the Remote Desktop apps, right, so I went ahead and did that so I downloaded OS X server \r\n\r\n435\r\n01:00:47,700 --> 01:00:57,266\r\nand the OS X server, you'll remember, was 179 MG in size so it just downloaded here on my client and if I jump back over to my server I can \r\n\r\n436\r\n01:00:57,266 --> 01:01:06,866\r\nsee right here cache used 179 MB and you know it's Mac software that I downloaded and if I jump back over to this guy and I take something \r\n\r\n437\r\n01:01:06,866 --> 01:01:13,766\r\nlike the Apple Remote Desktop, well Apple Remote Desktop, if I remember right, was something like 29 MB in size so I can download \r\n\r\n438\r\n01:01:13,766 --> 01:01:23,466\r\nthat ... oh no, 12.9 MB so it's going to download that and then once it's downloaded I can jump back over to my server and it may take it a \r\n\r\n439\r\n01:01:23,466 --> 01:01:29,966\r\nsecond but that cache will change here in just a moment to reflect that extra storage.  It updates dynamically every now and then and so it will \r\n\r\n440\r\n01:01:29,966 --> 01:01:37,299\r\nshow more apps as there's iOS software and books and other ... you know, as various things are downloaded they're starting to get cached \r\n\r\n441\r\n01:01:37,300 --> 01:01:47,233\r\nhere.  If someone else on my network goes to download the OS X server or the Remote Desktop utility then instead of pulling it from \r\n\r\n442\r\n01:01:47,233 --> 01:01:53,466\r\nApple they'll pull right here from the cache and I know the cache is working because I didn't change anything on that client.  I just logged \r\n\r\n443\r\n01:01:53,466 --> 01:02:00,199\r\ninto the app store and downloaded.  It automatically found it and it cached.  You know what I mean, sometimes if you switch screens \r\n\r\n444\r\n01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:08,366\r\nand come back it kind of forces it.  Ah, there we go.  Yep, so it just jumped from 179 to 192 so I can see it's got that increased storage.  All right, \r\n\r\n445\r\n01:02:08,366 --> 01:02:17,599\r\nand you know I don't have any ...  in theory, anybody here in the studio should start using my caching server so if somebody in the studio \r\n\r\n446\r\n01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:24,866\r\nwere to fire up an iPhone or whatever and download an app, then it would kick in here as iOS software.  I don't have a device.  I've got an \r\n\r\n447\r\n01:02:24,866 --> 01:02:31,466\r\nandroid device here.  That's not going to help.  So, anyhow, so we'd see that.  The caching server is super cool, basically because of its \r\n\r\n448\r\n01:02:31,466 --> 01:02:38,932\r\nsimplicity.  It's really easy.  You know, you just turn it on.  There's not a whole heck of a lot of settings.  If you need to, you can clear the \r\n\r\n449\r\n01:02:38,933 --> 01:02:45,999\r\ncache just by hitting reset.  If you're going to move it to another drive, a lot of times it's a good idea to go ahead and reset it so that it moves \r\n\r\n450\r\n01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:53,766\r\nfaster and gets the cash active again faster.  So you can reset it and it just empties out and then the next time somebody downloads something \r\n\r\n451\r\n01:02:53,766 --> 01:03:03,866\r\nit'll just get cached again so if somebody were to go in and take like that Apple Remote Desktop and uninstall it, then you know so I've \r\n\r\n452\r\n01:03:03,866 --> 01:03:15,532\r\ngot it installed on my system and if they were to uninstall it and install it again or whatever, then it would just recache and get put back in there so \r\n\r\n453\r\n01:03:15,533 --> 01:03:22,533\r\nreally cool, really easy.  For the exam, obviously they're not going to hit you too hard on getting this configured because it is pretty simple but \r\n\r\n454\r\n01:03:22,533 --> 01:03:29,566\r\nyou do want to make sure that you fully understand the differences between software update and caching.  Both of them provide \r\n\r\n455\r\n01:03:29,566 --> 01:03:36,432\r\nInternet bandwidth optimization.  The caching server does it better because it also caches other things like full product downloads from the \r\n\r\n456\r\n01:03:36,433 --> 01:03:44,666\r\napp store.  The software update server doesn't.  The software update server, on the other hand, gives you the ability to control updates, turning \r\n\r\n457\r\n01:03:44,666 --> 01:03:52,599\r\nthem on or off, preventing people from getting updates.  The caching server can't do that.  All right?  Now, you might notice on my system I'm \r\n\r\n458\r\n01:03:52,600 --> 01:04:00,100\r\nnow running both.  I'm running the caching server and the software update server so what we do we have ... caching Battle Royale, right, \r\n\r\n459\r\n01:04:00,100 --> 01:04:09,233\r\nso the two services conflict.  They do the same thing, in a sense, so they they do bump up against each other.  All right?  When you run \r\n\r\n460\r\n01:04:09,233 --> 01:04:19,399\r\nboth the software update server always wins, so any clients configured to use the software update server will use it and not the caching \r\n\r\n461\r\n01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:26,366\r\nserver, all right, but then any other clients in your network that are not configured to the user software update server will use the caching \r\n\r\n462\r\n01:04:26,366 --> 01:04:35,166\r\nserver so you can run both on the same server at the same time like I'm doing right now.  It's just your clients are only going to use one or the \r\n\r\n463\r\n01:04:35,166 --> 01:04:42,499\r\nother.  Your clients will not use both.  If they're configured for a software update server, that's all they'll use.  If they're not configured for a \r\n\r\n464\r\n01:04:42,500 --> 01:04:49,300\r\nsoftware update server, they'll use the caching server, if it's available and if neither are available, they'll just go out to Apple, right.  That does \r\n\r\n465\r\n01:04:49,300 --> 01:05:00,166\r\nwork, so that's what most of our systems do, anyway.  All right, so that pretty much wraps up the caching server and with that, that wraps up \r\n\r\n466\r\n01:05:00,166 --> 01:05:07,566\r\nMac Management Basics.  Right?  We got to see a lot of stuff throughout this course that really pertains to businesses and enterprises, \r\n\r\n467\r\n01:05:07,566 --> 01:05:15,132\r\npeople managing a lot of Macs, and they're neat utilities, neat stuff that really helps to optimize that performance on your network.  So, I hope \r\n\r\n468\r\n01:05:15,133 --> 01:05:23,233\r\nyou enjoyed it.  The exam for this for this certification ...   it's an honest exam.  It's really straightforward.  You will not see a question on \r\n\r\n469\r\n01:05:23,233 --> 01:05:30,666\r\nthere that did not get answered at some point either during this show or in your book.  If you haven't downloaded it already, make sure you go \r\n\r\n470\r\n01:05:30,666 --> 01:05:38,166\r\nto the Apple certification page and download the PDF.  It's not big.  It's like 90 pages.  You can probably read it in an evening and it goes \r\n\r\n471\r\n01:05:38,166 --> 01:05:43,766\r\nthrough all the different things that we talked about in this show.  I have used it as the guideline, so, you know, make sure you read \r\n\r\n472\r\n01:05:43,766 --> 01:05:50,499\r\nthrough that.  I think you'll find that the exam is very straightforward.  If you understand the concepts, you're ready to go.  Go in there and \r\n\r\n473\r\n01:05:50,500 --> 01:05:59,633\r\ntake that exam and get certified.  So, I wish you guys the best of luck.  Remember, if you have any questions, that ...  well, normally I say live \r\n\r\n474\r\n01:05:59,633 --> 01:06:07,633\r\nduring the show, but we're kind of ending it here, so it won't be live, but if you see us live doing another show, you can go to itpro.tv/live and \r\n\r\n475\r\n01:06:07,633 --> 01:06:14,799\r\nyou'll see the chat box beneath the video.  You can post your questions there.  We monitor and answer during the show.  If you have a question \r\n\r\n476\r\n01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:22,266\r\nafterwards, when we're off the air, well, go to our Q&A forums.  Hit that Q&A link at the top of the page.
