talking about managing macOS Server\n10.13, a new course with Don Pezet.\n\n4\n00:00:12.055 --> 00:00:15.285\nDon, can you tell us\nwhat the course is about?\n\n5\n00:00:15.285 --> 00:00:16.098\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely,\n\n6\n00:00:16.098 --> 00:00:19.889\nmost of us know macOS as a desktop\noperating system that we can run on\n\n7\n00:00:19.889 --> 00:00:23.290\nlaptops, and iMacs, Mac Minis,\nand all that good stuff.\n\n8\n00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:29.100\nBut macOS is built on top of BSD Unix,\nwhich is a very powerful server platform.\n\n9\n00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.080\nSo we can actually leverage\nmacOS as a server.\n\n10\n00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:36.330\nAnd in fact, Apple has the macOS server\napp available in the App Store that has\n\n11\n00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:38.890\na number of different\nfunctions inside of it.\n\n12\n00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:43.000\nAnd we've done this series over the years\nfor other platforms like El Capitan,\n\n13\n00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.630\nand Mavericks, and even Sierra but\nin High Sierra, macOS 10.13,\n\n14\n00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:52.640\nthere are significant changes coming\ndown from Apple on the server app.\n\n15\n00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.960\nA lot of services are going away.\n\n16\n00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.030\nSome services are staying,\nsome are going away,\n\n17\n00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:59.890\nsome are being replaced\nby other functions.\n\n18\n00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:05.200\nIt's the biggest change to the macOS\nserver app in almost a decade.\n\n19\n00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.080\nReally a long time.\n\n20\n00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.500\nThis is a really significant\namount of change.\n\n21\n00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.501\nSo in this series we're gonna be\ntaking a look at macOS server,\n\n22\n00:01:11.501 --> 00:01:15.410\nhow we can use our Mac as a server, how we\ncan leverage the services that Apple still\n\n23\n00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:19.206\nprovides in macOS server app, but also\ntake a look at some of the other functions\n\n24\n00:01:19.206 --> 00:01:22.292\nthat we can bring in to replace\nthe functionality that's gone.\n\n25\n00:01:22.292 --> 00:01:24.813\nIf you depend on the service\nthat's no longer supported,\n\n26\n00:01:24.813 --> 00:01:26.310\nwe need some kind of alternative.\n\n27\n00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.600\nSo, we're gonna be looking at that.\n\n28\n00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.130\nSo, if you've never used macOS server,\nthis series is gonna be a great place for\n\n29\n00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.350\nyou to jump and\nget a chance to learn about it.\n\n30\n00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.104\nIf you are already neck deep in it and\nyou need to support it and\n\n31\n00:01:37.104 --> 00:01:40.290\nnow you're trying to figure out what\nto do about services going away,\n\n32\n00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.460\nwe're gonna get a chance to tackle that,\ntoo.\n\n33\n00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.496\nSo, we'll cover a lot of really\ngood stuff throughout this series.\n\n34\n00:01:45.496 --> 00:01:46.487\n&gt;&gt; Important information and\n\n35\n00:01:46.487 --> 00:01:47.780\nyou've already touched on this but\n\n36\n00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:49.950\nwho's this show targeted towards?\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n37\n00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.310\nit's really targeted towards\nsystem administrators.\n\n38\n00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:57.100\nIf you work in a business environment and\nyou're supporting macOS servers, this\n\n39\n00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.100\nseries is for you, because you need to be\nsure to know what the future road map is.\n\n40\n00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.790\nHow to adapt your servers to support\nApple's future support model.\n\n41\n00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.220\nYou don't want to run software that's\nnot supported by Apple anymore.\n\n42\n00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.160\nThat's basically gonna leave you\nup to all types of security risks.\n\n43\n00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.830\nSo if you're working in a business\nsupporting macOS servers,\n\n44\n00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:16.060\nthis course is for you.\n\n45\n00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.720\nIf you're not, but maybe that's what\nyou want to do, maybe you work in\n\n46\n00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.113\nan environment where maybe you already\nsupport Windows Servers, or Linux servers,\n\n47\n00:02:24.113 --> 00:02:27.529\nand you just wanna entertain the idea\nof using macOS as a server, or\n\n48\n00:02:27.529 --> 00:02:29.929\nmaybe you're just\na regular macOS home user.\n\n49\n00:02:29.929 --> 00:02:33.041\nAnd you're thinking, boy, I'd like to set\nup a little server here in my house, or\n\n50\n00:02:33.041 --> 00:02:34.140\njust learn about it.\n\n51\n00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.370\nWell, we're gonna cover that too.\n\n52\n00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.430\nWe're gonna start off from the very basics\nand work up to the more advanced so\n\n53\n00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.670\nit covers a lot of ground.\n\n54\n00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.260\nNow I will tell you many\npeople are saying, hey,\n\n55\n00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.650\nif Apple is shrinking down macOS\nservices as far as being a server,\n\n56\n00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.070\nwe need to move the services\nover to Linux servers.\n\n57\n00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:55.620\nIf you want to do that,\nthis course is not exactly right for you.\n\n58\n00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.420\nInstead, you should jump over and\ncheck out our Linux Plus series.\n\n59\n00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.010\nWe cover how to set up Linux as a server,\nget services loaded on it and\n\n60\n00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:04.420\nget everything up and running there.\n\n61\n00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.980\nBut it's a different operating\nsystem under the hood.\n\n62\n00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.580\nI mentioned on macOS is running\nBSD Unix under the hood.\n\n63\n00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:12.410\nThat is not the same as Linux.\n\n64\n00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:13.800\nThe commands are not all the same.\n\n65\n00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:14.910\nThe software is not the same.\n\n66\n00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:16.420\nIt is a different world.\n\n67\n00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.980\nSo if you're interested in\nusing Linux as your server,\n\n68\n00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:20.400\nbe sure to jump over to that show.\n\n69\n00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.100\nBut if you're interested in\nlearning about macOS as a server\n\n70\n00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:24.340\nthis is the right place to be.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n71\n00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:29.240\nis there a certification involved?\n&gt;&gt; There used to be, there isn't anymore.\n\n72\n00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:32.600\nSo Apple used to have the Apple\nCertified Technical Coordinator, or\n\n73\n00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.920\nACTC certification,\nwhich they've ended that certification.\n\n74\n00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.520\nIt's no longer available,\nyou can't take the test.\n\n75\n00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:42.000\nAnd there used to be a course\ncalled macOS Server Essentials,\n\n76\n00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.420\noriginally it was called\nOS X Server Essentials.\n\n77\n00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:48.170\nWell, since they have effectively gutted\nthe server app, there's no need for\n\n78\n00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:51.570\nthat server essential course anymore,\nand so they've eliminated that one too.\n\n79\n00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:54.040\nSo there's no course,\nthere's no certification.\n\n80\n00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.310\nIt's all just gone.\n\n81\n00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:58.690\nWell, the problem there is what happens\nto all the people who have macOS\n\n82\n00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:00.040\nservers out there?\n\n83\n00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.880\nKind of left to their own devices.\n\n84\n00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:02.910\nWell, what do they do?\n\n85\n00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:07.150\nAnd if you're in an all-Mac environment,\nwouldn't it be nice to stand up a server\n\n86\n00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:10.400\nand not have to bring in some other\noperating system you're not familiar with?\n\n87\n00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.370\nWell, you still can, there is still a\nsupported path that we can follow here to\n\n88\n00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.010\nbuild up these servers, and\nthat's why this knowledge is relevant.\n\n89\n00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:19.180\nSo there's not a certification,\n\n90\n00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.340\nbut there is a real world need for\nthe skills that we're going to learn right\n\n91\n00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:25.015\nhere in this series.\n&gt;&gt; So what topics are covered management\n\n92\n00:04:25.015 --> 00:04:27.907\nmac OS servers 10.13?\n&gt;&gt; All right we're going to cover a wide\n\n93\n00:04:27.907 --> 00:04:30.690\nrange of things, we're going to\nstart off with the super basics,\n\n94\n00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:33.050\nwe're going to see how to\ninstall the macOS server app.\n\n95\n00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:35.478\nNow, there's only a couple of\nservices left in it, right?\n\n96\n00:04:35.478 --> 00:04:37.104\nBut we still need to\nknow how to install it.\n\n97\n00:04:37.104 --> 00:04:40.030\nAnd then we'll take a look at those\nservices that are still built in.\n\n98\n00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:43.476\nIt's really just two,\nopen directory and profile manager.\n\n99\n00:04:43.476 --> 00:04:46.974\nSo we'll take a look at those\ntwo services, how they work, and\n\n100\n00:04:46.974 --> 00:04:49.551\nhow we can use those, and\nsee what they can do.\n\n101\n00:04:49.551 --> 00:04:54.047\nThen we're gonna take a look at\nsome of the services that have been\n\n102\n00:04:54.047 --> 00:04:57.850\nremoved from the server app\nthat are now part of macOS.\n\n103\n00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:59.468\nSo, for example,\nsetting up a time machine server.\n\n104\n00:04:59.468 --> 00:05:01.380\nYou don't need the server app for\nthat anymore.\n\n105\n00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:02.828\nIt's just built into macOS.\n\n106\n00:05:02.828 --> 00:05:06.160\nYou can turn any Mac into\na Time Machine server.\n\n107\n00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:07.840\nA cacheing server, same thing.\n\n108\n00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:09.470\nA file server, same thing.\n\n109\n00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:10.930\nThat's all built in to the base OS.\n\n110\n00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:13.910\nSo, we'll take a look at those\nfunctions and what those roles are.\n\n111\n00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:18.093\nNow that's five different services right\nthere that are still fully supported by\n\n112\n00:05:18.093 --> 00:05:22.217\nApple, and still available right now and\nfor the forseeable future they've not\n\n113\n00:05:22.217 --> 00:05:24.597\nannounced end of life on any of those,\nright?\n\n114\n00:05:24.597 --> 00:05:27.686\nBut then we're going to\nlook at all the others.\n\n115\n00:05:27.686 --> 00:05:31.500\nThere's a solid 10 other services that\nhave all been pruned off by Apple and\n\n116\n00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.740\nthese aren't services nobody cares about.\n\n117\n00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:35.110\nWell, some of them are, right?\n\n118\n00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:36.590\nLike there was a Wiki service.\n\n119\n00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:37.470\nNobody used that thing.\n\n120\n00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:38.810\nIt was just a web server.\n\n121\n00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:41.270\nThere's really no point in\nhaving a service for it.\n\n122\n00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:43.020\nNow it's gone.\n\n123\n00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:44.135\nThe VPN service.\n\n124\n00:05:44.135 --> 00:05:48.110\nMacOS was never made a good VPN server so\npeople used firewalls for that.\n\n125\n00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:49.310\nThey use other options.\n\n126\n00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:51.170\nSo that makes sense those would go away.\n\n127\n00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:58.000\nBut their service is like DNS, DHCP,\nfile services though FTP or SFTP.\n\n128\n00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.820\nThose are services that people use\nevery single day that are important.\n\n129\n00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:03.590\nNet install.\n\n130\n00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:04.550\nNet boot.\n\n131\n00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:06.050\nThose are really important.\n\n132\n00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:09.530\nIf you're supporting a thousand Macs and\nyou need to pull an image out,\n\n133\n00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:10.632\nthose are important.\n\n134\n00:06:10.632 --> 00:06:13.999\nOr those are all gone from macOS server,\nright?\n\n135\n00:06:13.999 --> 00:06:18.159\nBut what a lot of people don't realize is\nwhile Apple has removed the macOS server,\n\n136\n00:06:18.159 --> 00:06:20.966\nthey haven't completely\nkilled our support for them.\n\n137\n00:06:20.966 --> 00:06:24.700\nThat a lot of these are really just\nUnix services in the background.\n\n138\n00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:26.760\nAnd those unique services\nare still there and\n\n139\n00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:30.210\nstill supported by Apple with\nno end of life announced.\n\n140\n00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:33.910\nWhich means we're losing the graphical\nuser interface, the GUI, it's going away.\n\n141\n00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:37.600\nBut we still have the command line tools\nin the background to be able to fire these\n\n142\n00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:41.730\nservices up, run them reliably and\ncontinue doing it for years to come.\n\n143\n00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:43.040\nThat functionality is there.\n\n144\n00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:46.013\nSo, we're gonna take a look\nthe services that are still there, but\n\n145\n00:06:46.013 --> 00:06:48.952\nfrom a command line perspective,\nand see how it can manage those.\n\n146\n00:06:48.952 --> 00:06:51.577\nAnd then for the one or\ntwo that are totally gone,\n\n147\n00:06:51.577 --> 00:06:55.530\nthat are gone from the server app and\ngone from the command line.\n\n148\n00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:57.580\nWell, Apple has recommended replacements.\n\n149\n00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:00.033\nThey've said, here's an alternate\nsoftware you can use or\n\n150\n00:07:00.033 --> 00:07:02.644\nan alternate solution you can use\nto provide that same service.\n\n151\n00:07:02.644 --> 00:07:06.171\nWe're gonna take a look at those alternate\nsolutions and see what it takes to get\n\n152\n00:07:06.171 --> 00:07:09.310\nthat deployed, get it put in place,\nand have it up and running.\n\n153\n00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:11.560\nA great example of that is DNS.\n\n154\n00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:15.550\nWith DNS, macOS used to use\nthe bind service in the background.\n\n155\n00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:17.350\nThat's what was built\nin to the server app.\n\n156\n00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:18.850\nWell, Apple didn't make bind.\n\n157\n00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:22.520\nBind is made by a different organization,\nISE.\n\n158\n00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:26.702\nAnd so, in that case, you can just go and\nget bind from ISE and\n\n159\n00:07:26.702 --> 00:07:31.136\nload it onto your server and\nrun it, and it works great, right?\n\n160\n00:07:31.136 --> 00:07:32.424\nAnd it's still supported and\n\n161\n00:07:32.424 --> 00:07:35.268\nit's actually several versions\nahead of what Apple is running.\n\n162\n00:07:35.268 --> 00:07:38.660\nSo in those cases we just need to know\nwho is the replacement, how do I get that\n\n163\n00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:41.897\nloaded, how do I get it up and running and\nnow I've got the same service.\n\n164\n00:07:41.897 --> 00:07:44.853\nThat's all stuff that we're gonna be\nlooking at right here in the series.\n\n165\n00:07:44.853 --> 00:07:45.810\n&gt;&gt; Well, thanks Don.\n\n166\n00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:49.549\nAnd if managing macOS servers 10.13 sounds\nlike something you'd be interested in, and\n\n167\n00:07:49.549 --> 00:07:50.174\nyou should be.\n\n168\n00:07:50.174 --> 00:07:53.115\nMake sure to watch all the episodes\nin our course library.\n\n169\n00:07:53.115 --> 00:08:00.364\nThanks for\nwatching the binge-worth ITPro.TV.\n\n170\n00:08:00.364 --> 00:08:02.439\n[MUSIC]\n\n",
