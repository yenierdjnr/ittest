Sure thing.\n\n9\n00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:23.430\nSo hi everybody.\n\n10\n00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.300\nI am the CEO of Red Lion.\n\n11\n00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:31.270\nI am a graduate of the business of,\ngeez, I can't even speak right now.\n\n12\n00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:35.230\nThe school of hard knocks when\nit comes to business, right?\n\n13\n00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:39.500\nI am a peer review on SYNACK\nthe Info Sec journal.\n\n14\n00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.440\nI do hold certifications although\nI won't tell you which, right?\n\n15\n00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.730\nAnd my real passion are people and\nbusiness.\n\n16\n00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:45.230\nJosh.\n\n17\n00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.940\n&gt;&gt; So my name's Joshua Marpet, I'm the COO\nof Red Lion, Chief Operating Officer.\n\n18\n00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.410\nI've been around the block more than once.\n\n19\n00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:53.690\nYou've probably heard me say this but\n\n20\n00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.265\nI'm an ex-cop, I'm an ex-fireman, I'm\nan ex horse dentist, I'm an ex-blacksmith.\n\n21\n00:00:57.265 --> 00:00:59.840\nN,o that's not a joke, that's actually me.\n\n22\n00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.260\nI've been a jail guard,\n\n23\n00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.430\nI've done just about everything except\nastronaut, and I'm working on that.\n\n24\n00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:07.341\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\n\n25\n00:01:07.341 --> 00:01:12.480\nI run Security BSides Delaware\nalong with Janice Paulson.\n\n26\n00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.902\nAnd occasionally I get to sleep,\nit's an amazing thing, so.\n\n27\n00:01:15.902 --> 00:01:19.850\n&gt;&gt; So today let's talk about\nwhat we're getting into, right?\n\n28\n00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.760\nSo, we're dealing with the 171, okay.\n\n29\n00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.990\nWe need to know who is NIST?\n\n30\n00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.530\nWe need to know what the heck 171 is.\n\n31\n00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.173\nHow does it translate to entities\nthat deal with the government?\n\n32\n00:01:32.173 --> 00:01:34.455\nHow does it change process?\n\n33\n00:01:34.455 --> 00:01:38.050\nHow does it change the certification,\nright?\n\n34\n00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:39.394\nWhat is the certification?\n\n35\n00:01:39.394 --> 00:01:41.108\nWhat is the cost associated?\n\n36\n00:01:41.108 --> 00:01:45.710\nAnd some other general Q and A about 171.\n\n37\n00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.770\nSo let's start of with NIST.\n\n38\n00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:50.260\nNIST is the National Institute\nof Standards and\n\n39\n00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:55.960\nTechnology it is developed by the US\nDepartment of Commerce, founded in 1901.\n\n40\n00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.280\nNIST is responsible for\n\n41\n00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.920\na lot of the major certification projects\nthat you'll find with the US Government.\n\n42\n00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.990\nFrom 5g wireless standards to Biopharms\n\n43\n00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:11.110\nto ICS/SCADA which is industrial\ncontrol systems, all right?\n\n44\n00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:12.700\n&gt;&gt; All the way to bullet proof vests.\n\n45\n00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:13.270\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n46\n00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.045\n&gt;&gt; It's really cool,\nthey get to shoot people.\n\n47\n00:02:15.045 --> 00:02:16.880\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Man.\n\n48\n00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.990\nSo NIST is actually responsible for\na lot of what drives government standards.\n\n49\n00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:28.370\nNow, with that being said, we need to take\na look at what 171 is specific around.\n\n50\n00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.130\nAnd that really is the protection\nof controlled information for\n\n51\n00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:35.350\nunclassified systems.\n\n52\n00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:41.640\nAnd that is around non-federal,\nit is around information systems.\n\n53\n00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.480\nSo basically, go ahead Josh.\n\n54\n00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.170\n&gt;&gt; What we're talking about is you've\ngot to pull the important terms out\n\n55\n00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.970\nof that title.\n\n56\n00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.530\nOkay, the full title of NIST 800-171 is\n\n57\n00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.570\nProtecting Controlled Unclassified\nInformation, CUI, by the way is\n\n58\n00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:58.220\nthe abbreviation, in Non-federal\nInformation Systems and Organizations.\n\n59\n00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.616\nOkay, so it's protecting information\nthat's not in a classification scheme, for\n\n60\n00:03:02.616 --> 00:03:04.370\nnon-federal agencies.\n\n61\n00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.120\nWhy would NIST care about that?\n\n62\n00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.070\n&gt;&gt; I don't know.\n\n63\n00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:09.470\nWhy would NIST care about that?\n\n64\n00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:14.460\nReally what we're looking at the access,\nwe're looking at security requirements\n\n65\n00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:20.060\nbased around access control,\nbased around identity and authentication.\n\n66\n00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:21.600\nBased around incident response and\n\n67\n00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.510\nmaintenance, based around\npersonnel security.\n\n68\n00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.830\n&gt;&gt; So Scott, this looks like a serious\ninformation security program, and\n\n69\n00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:29.820\na fairly complete one.\n\n70\n00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:31.500\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; You've got all the identification,\n\n71\n00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.490\nyou got the accountability,\nyou've got all the training,\n\n72\n00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:37.690\nsort of every piece of a information\nsecurity program is here.\n\n73\n00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.060\nBut this is specifically for\nnon-federal agencies and\n\n74\n00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.870\norganizations for\nunclassified information.\n\n75\n00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:47.030\nI mean, who does this apply to?\n\n76\n00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:50.580\n&gt;&gt; Well, it applies a lot to companies\nthat wanna do business with the federal\n\n77\n00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:52.460\ngovernment, right?\n\n78\n00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:58.600\nSo the real question is, Josh,\nif I may, why do I care, right?\n\n79\n00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:04.730\nWell, why I care is because either I\nhave to be a part of DFARS, right?\n\n80\n00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:05.470\n&gt;&gt; What's DFARS?\n\n81\n00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:09.500\n&gt;&gt; DFARS,\nthe DOD Federal Acquisition Resource?\n\n82\n00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:10.190\n&gt;&gt; Regulations.\n\n83\n00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:14.470\n&gt;&gt; Regulations, or FARS,\nthe Federal Acquisition Regulations.\n\n84\n00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:15.240\nThank you.\n\n85\n00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:19.180\nAm I a government contractor because,\nguess what, I care.\n\n86\n00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:25.700\nAm I sub to a sub to a sub to a sub,\nI still have to deal with 171, right?\n\n87\n00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:29.680\nBut the question I say is, why not 27001?\n\n88\n00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:34.422\n&gt;&gt; Well because 27001 is incredibly\nparticular it's a detailed-oriented\n\n89\n00:04:34.422 --> 00:04:35.419\nbeyond belief.\n\n90\n00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:39.821\n800-171 is a significant\namount easier than ISO 27001.\n\n91\n00:04:39.821 --> 00:04:42.295\nIt's a little more far reaching, but\n\n92\n00:04:42.295 --> 00:04:47.020\nISO 27001 is the OCD cousin\nof 800171 if you will.\n\n93\n00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:50.435\nSo it also is a nice stepping stone it\nhelps you build to the next cyber security\n\n94\n00:04:50.435 --> 00:04:51.442\nframework, the CSL.\n\n95\n00:04:51.442 --> 00:04:55.380\nSo effectively, if you care about this\nyou're either a government contractor,\n\n96\n00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:59.504\nyou're a government sub to a contractor,\nor sub to a government contractor rather.\n\n97\n00:04:59.504 --> 00:05:02.202\nYou need to prove that\nyou're following a risk\n\n98\n00:05:02.202 --> 00:05:04.630\nmanagement program of some sort, okay?\n\n99\n00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:07.450\nFor a sale, for a customer,\nfor a supplier, for\n\n100\n00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:09.940\na regulatory regime of some sort.\n\n101\n00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:12.450\nAnd you go, you know, 800 one\nsomething one doesn't sound so bad.\n\n102\n00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:16.950\nIt's understandable those families\nof controls that we just looked at\n\n103\n00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:21.090\nare totally literally realistic,\nthey're reasonable.\n\n104\n00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:26.810\n&gt;&gt; They are and so 171 actually\nbreaks down the four main steps and\n\n105\n00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:30.760\nthose are Review, Implement,\nAnalyze, and Audit.\n\n106\n00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:32.740\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\nlet's talk about each of them real quick.\n\n107\n00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:33.360\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n108\n00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:36.488\n&gt;&gt; So in Review,\nyou're gonna go over what you have now.\n\n109\n00:05:36.488 --> 00:05:40.898\nYou're gonna see, hey I'm right here,\nand you're going to go, hum,\n\n110\n00:05:40.898 --> 00:05:43.070\nthey need me to be over here.\n\n111\n00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:45.920\nSo how do I get from A to B?\n\n112\n00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:46.960\nAnd that's implement.\n\n113\n00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:48.830\nThis leads to each other very very nicely.\n\n114\n00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:49.840\n&gt;&gt; It does.\n\n115\n00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:51.070\n&gt;&gt; So\nyou're going to review what you have.\n\n116\n00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:54.260\nYou're going to review what you are,\nyour business process, and your CUI.\n\n117\n00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.740\nIn other words,\nwhat information do I have?\n\n118\n00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:01.480\nThat's data classification, that's\nmanaging your assets, asset inventory.\n\n119\n00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:04.610\nThat's knowing who has\naccess to those assets.\n\n120\n00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:09.510\nThat's understanding your business\nprocesses around those assets,\n\n121\n00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:11.880\naround that date,\naround those classifications.\n\n122\n00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:14.240\nAnd then realizing that I have a gap,\nI have a risk,\n\n123\n00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:16.780\nI have a problem I need to fix that.\n\n124\n00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:20.940\nSo, I'm gonna implement some controls,\nsome segmentation, some new processes.\n\n125\n00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:25.870\nModify the existing ones or\nwhatever, and then.\n\n126\n00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:27.810\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna step right in to analyze.\n\n127\n00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:31.720\nSo let's make sure that we've done\nour review correctly, we've done our\n\n128\n00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:35.800\nimplementation correctly, which really\nleads us to a controls gap, right?\n\n129\n00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:39.550\nSo where are we, where are we headed and\nhow do we get there right?\n\n130\n00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:43.230\nAnd that's really your gap, that's where\na good gap analysis comes into place.\n\n131\n00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:45.710\n&gt;&gt; Well, right, and so\nthen we've done our review.\n\n132\n00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:49.090\nWe've implemented to fix the gap,\nwe've analyzed to make sure that we fixed\n\n133\n00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:52.510\nthe gap, this is basically the double\ncheck, and then we're gonna audit.\n\n134\n00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:55.580\nAnd the audit is gonna be where we say,\nwe are actually in compliance,\n\n135\n00:06:55.580 --> 00:07:00.740\nwe are validating, we are verifying,\nwe are making sure we're doing it right.\n\n136\n00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:05.060\n&gt;&gt; But the audit also comes into play\nwhen trying to deal with your road map.\n\n137\n00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:11.530\nThe roadmap basically says, how we're\ngoing to implement the entire solution.\n\n138\n00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:15.140\nWhen you audit, it's not that\nyou're auditing for a compliance.\n\n139\n00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:19.630\nSure, that might be something\ngained to help your business but,\n\n140\n00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:22.830\nat the same time, you're really auditing,\nand a lot of companies miss this,\n\n141\n00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:26.190\nyou're auditing to make sure that\nyou're matching your roadmap.\n\n142\n00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:28.144\n&gt;&gt; Well agreed, agreed.\n\n143\n00:07:28.144 --> 00:07:33.295\nSo your road map, or your strategic\nroad map really, says that I want to be,\n\n144\n00:07:33.295 --> 00:07:38.280\nlet's say, I wanna have 5000 new\ncustomers by the end of the year.\n\n145\n00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:41.790\nThose customers are gonna be in\nthe government space, those customers\n\n146\n00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:46.340\nare gonna want me to be certified or\nat least secure in some form or fashion.\n\n147\n00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:49.726\nWe're gonna use 800-171 to show them that\nwe have a risk management framework.\n\n148\n00:07:49.726 --> 00:07:53.015\nTo get 800-171, we're going to make\nsure that we've done our gap analysis,\n\n149\n00:07:53.015 --> 00:07:55.665\nwe're gonna make sure that we've analyzed,\nwe've implemented,\n\n150\n00:07:55.665 --> 00:07:57.001\nwe've taken care of everything.\n\n151\n00:07:57.001 --> 00:08:00.503\nWe're gonna use this as a stepping stone\nin that road map to get all those new\n\n152\n00:08:00.503 --> 00:08:04.075\ncustomers, to get all that new business,\nto get all those things going on.\n\n153\n00:08:04.075 --> 00:08:06.490\nOkay, so the government has come down and\n\n154\n00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:10.490\nsaid that all DOD contractors\nmust be 171 compliant by what?\n\n155\n00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:12.870\nDecember 31st?\n\n156\n00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:13.370\n&gt;&gt; 2017.\n&gt;&gt; Of 2017, right.\n\n157\n00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:13.920\nSo\n\n158\n00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:17.862\nmy real question to you is how\ndoes this relate to our business?\n\n159\n00:08:17.862 --> 00:08:18.535\n&gt;&gt; That easy.\n\n160\n00:08:18.535 --> 00:08:20.185\nAre you a government contractor?\n\n161\n00:08:20.185 --> 00:08:22.105\nAre you a sub to a government contractor?\n\n162\n00:08:22.105 --> 00:08:24.105\nAre you a sub to a sub to a sub to a sub?\n\n163\n00:08:24.105 --> 00:08:26.755\nAre you anywhere in\nthe supplier value chain?\n\n164\n00:08:26.755 --> 00:08:28.626\nThose terms by the way mean\nroughly the same thing,\n\n165\n00:08:28.626 --> 00:08:30.814\nit's just different people\nuse them differently, okay?\n\n166\n00:08:30.814 --> 00:08:34.765\nIf you are a supplier, if you are the\nperson actually doing the work, if you\n\n167\n00:08:34.765 --> 00:08:39.000\nare a customer, that is a value chain\nfrom supplier to processor to customer.\n\n168\n00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.088\nIf you're in that value chain anywhere,\nand by the way, there's are more,\n\n169\n00:08:42.088 --> 00:08:45.740\nthere's what,\n6,000 subcontractors to the government?\n\n170\n00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:47.510\n&gt;&gt; There's a lot.\n\n171\n00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:49.360\n&gt;&gt; So if there's 6,000\nsubcontractors to the government,\n\n172\n00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:51.990\nhow many subcontractors do they have?\n\n173\n00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:53.720\nDear God, the number is huge.\n\n174\n00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:56.690\nNow, there's also other\nreasons to use 800-171, or\n\n175\n00:08:56.690 --> 00:08:58.360\nany good risk management framework.\n\n176\n00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:00.350\nDo you wanna reduce your sales friction?\n\n177\n00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:04.150\nIf you go, hey,\nI'd like to sign up for ITPro.TV and\n\n178\n00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:05.700\nI wanna give you my credit card.\n\n179\n00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:09.210\nAnd they go, hey, we have managed to\nsecure your credit card information\n\n180\n00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:14.470\nbecause we are PCI compliant or\nusing a PCI compliant payment processor,\n\n181\n00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:16.600\nyou go, hey, I feel better about this.\n\n182\n00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:19.210\nI feel better about putting my\ncredit card in those little boxes\n\n183\n00:09:19.210 --> 00:09:22.500\nbecause I know that they're doing\nit in a secure fashion, okay?\n\n184\n00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:25.100\nAnd that's how you get it,\nyou reduce sales friction.\n\n185\n00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:28.160\nIf somebody said, hey, would you mind\nmailing me, snail mailing me, or faxing\n\n186\n00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:31.900\nme, that's fine, just send me a copy of\nyour credit card, would you feel secure?\n\n187\n00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:32.880\nCuz I know I wouldn't.\n\n188\n00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:38.060\n&gt;&gt; Right, so how does this affect your\nDFARS and your FARS standing, right?\n\n189\n00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:42.660\nAs a federal resource\nwe need to figure out\n\n190\n00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:47.730\nthe easiest way to move all of this\nforward and still be compliant, right?\n\n191\n00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:52.813\nSo understanding your contracting\nofficer and what their technical\n\n192\n00:09:52.813 --> 00:09:58.958\nrequirements are according to the FARS and\nthe DFARS will really help with 171.\n\n193\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:04.875\nBecause originally we used to have to deal\nwith 853 which was [INAUDIBLE] as what,\n\n194\n00:10:04.875 --> 00:10:06.489\nISO 27000\n&gt;&gt; 1 and 2.\n\n195\n00:10:06.489 --> 00:10:10.940\n&gt;&gt; 1 and 2, right.\nSo we've taken the medium listing for 853,\n\n196\n00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:15.020\nsprinkled in some ISO 27000 1 and 2, and\n\n197\n00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:19.696\nthat's how we got to 171\n&gt;&gt; Right so they're a little off topic,\n\n198\n00:10:19.696 --> 00:10:22.220\nbut there's a little bit more to that.\n\n199\n00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:24.730\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And the reason is that 853 is a pre\n\n200\n00:10:24.730 --> 00:10:25.670\nscriptive standard.\n\n201\n00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:28.995\n853 says you will do this,\nand this, and this.\n\n202\n00:10:28.995 --> 00:10:34.030\n800-171 is a descriptive standard, it says\nit will protect against these attacks.\n\n203\n00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:37.550\nHow you do it is up to you, because these\nthings change on, well, let's be honest,\n\n204\n00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:38.430\na daily basis.\n\n205\n00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:39.170\n&gt;&gt; They do.\n\n206\n00:10:39.170 --> 00:10:42.110\n&gt;&gt; But if you are protected\nagainst these types of attacks,\n\n207\n00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:43.540\nyou are following the standard.\n\n208\n00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:48.400\n&gt;&gt; Okay, okay, so seeing that we're\nprotected against these types of attacks,\n\n209\n00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:51.730\nright The real question is do I have\nto change the business process?\n\n210\n00:10:51.730 --> 00:10:52.300\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n211\n00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:53.490\n&gt;&gt; Because a lot of what we do,\n\n212\n00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:57.910\na lot of what we do and\na lot of what we say is that no matter\n\n213\n00:10:57.910 --> 00:11:02.130\nwhat you do as far as complain goes you\nhave to tailor to the business, right?\n\n214\n00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:07.530\nSo do do we change business process,\nmaybe, right.\n\n215\n00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:09.400\n&gt;&gt; It might be.\n\n216\n00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:13.790\nBut the thing is, here's the thing,\nit depends on your security maturity.\n\n217\n00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:17.610\nIt depends on your existing processes, it\ndepends on your risk management framework.\n\n218\n00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:19.330\nIf you're not using risk management,\n\n219\n00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:21.770\nif you don't have existing\nbusiness processes.\n\n220\n00:11:21.770 --> 00:11:25.460\nIf you don't have a high enough security\nmaturity, or any information security\n\n221\n00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:28.700\nmaturity, physical security\nmaturity all these different types.\n\n222\n00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:31.710\nThen yeah, you're gonna probably have to\nchange some of your business processes.\n\n223\n00:11:31.710 --> 00:11:34.360\nIf you've already built up a very,\nvery secure,\n\n224\n00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:39.310\nvery mature system of information physical\nsecurity, and you've got risk management,\n\n225\n00:11:39.310 --> 00:11:41.150\nyou're doing risk-based thinking.\n\n226\n00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:44.000\nYou're saying, I've got an asset\nworth $1,000, I'm spending $500 for\n\n227\n00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.760\nprotection, I'm protected up to this\nlevel, you're risk thinking, okay?\n\n228\n00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:49.640\nYou're thinking about your risk.\n\n229\n00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:50.240\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; You're probably\n\n230\n00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:53.660\nwon't have to change your processes at all\nor not very much, maybe a little tiny bit.\n\n231\n00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:57.450\n&gt;&gt; So if we go onto the next,\nwe're asking just a simple question here.\n\n232\n00:11:57.450 --> 00:11:58.850\nDo we really need to get certified?\n\n233\n00:11:58.850 --> 00:12:04.740\nIs there a certifying body for 171 that's\nbeen set up or, is it sort of like HIPAA\n\n234\n00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:10.090\nin that you say you're HIPAA certified but\nthere's really no paper for it?\n\n235\n00:12:10.090 --> 00:12:14.193\n&gt;&gt; So the contractors, remember we're\ntalking government contractors primarily,\n\n236\n00:12:14.193 --> 00:12:17.731\nthey're sort of the main receiving body or\naudience for this standard.\n\n237\n00:12:17.731 --> 00:12:21.507\nThe government contractors have no\nauditing body for this officially set up,\n\n238\n00:12:21.507 --> 00:12:25.392\nbut, of course, they can be audited by\nthe agency that are their customers at any\n\n239\n00:12:25.392 --> 00:12:28.676\ntime, or the prime contractors that\nare the customers at any time.\n\n240\n00:12:28.676 --> 00:12:32.081\nSo, while it's more like HIPAA,\nin that, there are audit protocols, and\n\n241\n00:12:32.081 --> 00:12:35.115\naudit standards, that have been set up so\nthat they can be audited,\n\n242\n00:12:35.115 --> 00:12:38.870\nthere's no real way to get that stamp of\napproval that says, funk, you're good.\n\n243\n00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:43.089\nSo it's a problem,\nthat's a real problem, you don't know.\n\n244\n00:12:43.089 --> 00:12:45.694\nYou go we're compliant according\nto our compliance officer,\n\n245\n00:12:45.694 --> 00:12:48.556\naccording to our paperwork,\naccording to everything we've done.\n\n246\n00:12:48.556 --> 00:12:51.061\nBut just like anybody can say,\nI see a problem, well,\n\n247\n00:12:51.061 --> 00:12:52.540\nwe didn't see a problem there.\n\n248\n00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:55.300\nWell, I do in my interpretation\nof the standards, and\n\n249\n00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:57.100\nthat's where the problem arises.\n\n250\n00:12:57.100 --> 00:13:00.060\n&gt;&gt; So right now, to help you out\na little bit, you're saying it's more of\n\n251\n00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:03.620\na self-certification process\nthan anything else, right?\n\n252\n00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:04.240\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n\n253\n00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:05.410\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; It absolutely is and\n\n254\n00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:08.530\nthat's fantastic because it means\nthat you can do it at your own pace.\n\n255\n00:13:08.530 --> 00:13:09.940\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; It means you can do it with your own\n\n256\n00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:10.580\nresources.\n\n257\n00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:13.170\nIt means you can really\nget very far down the path\n\n258\n00:13:13.170 --> 00:13:16.920\nwithout bringing in a huge\nmonstrous consulting company.\n\n259\n00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:20.640\nYou might bring in a trusted advisor who\nsays, hey, let's start with this plan,\n\n260\n00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:23.860\nlet's have these as goals,\nlet's do one piece at a time.\n\n261\n00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:26.620\nYou can do it slow and steady,\nvery stable, very comfortable and\n\n262\n00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:29.070\nnot totally upsetting\nthe apple cart if you will.\n\n263\n00:13:29.070 --> 00:13:31.650\nOn the other hand,\nit does cause problems sometimes.\n\n264\n00:13:31.650 --> 00:13:34.990\n&gt;&gt; So, that really runs us\ninto the question of cost.\n\n265\n00:13:36.050 --> 00:13:36.580\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n266\n00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:40.360\n&gt;&gt; A lot of companies try to budget for\nthings that they know.\n\n267\n00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:44.210\nThey try to budget for what they\ndon't know but more often then not,\n\n268\n00:13:44.210 --> 00:13:46.890\nthat budgeting gets\nblown out of the water.\n\n269\n00:13:46.890 --> 00:13:51.060\nWould something like this,\ngiven what needs to happen,\n\n270\n00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:53.220\nblow our budget under the water\nif you are not careful.\n\n271\n00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:56.320\n&gt;&gt; It depends, so,\nlet's go over budgeting.\n\n272\n00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:59.540\nOkay, this, I should be very honest and\n\n273\n00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:03.070\ntell you that this is very specific\nto Red Lion's way of doing business.\n\n274\n00:14:03.070 --> 00:14:09.060\nThere is no one god given way to do this,\nbut there are quite a few ways to do it.\n\n275\n00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:12.490\nWe like to do a gap analysis because we\nbelieve that we don't know how much it's\n\n276\n00:14:12.490 --> 00:14:14.860\ngonna cost until we know\nwhere you stand right now.\n\n277\n00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:17.450\nWe already know what the regulations\nsay you have to do and be and\n\n278\n00:14:17.450 --> 00:14:19.810\nwhere you have to end up.\n\n279\n00:14:19.810 --> 00:14:21.190\nBut we don't know where you are now.\n\n280\n00:14:21.190 --> 00:14:23.960\nSo unless we know that how\ncan we tell you the cost?\n\n281\n00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:27.060\nSo we tend to do a gap analysis that takes\nanywhere from two to four weeks, and\n\n282\n00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:29.324\ncosts somewhere between 10 and $50,000.\n\n283\n00:14:29.324 --> 00:14:34.496\nAll right, that's on site, offsite,\ninterviews, investigation,\n\n284\n00:14:34.496 --> 00:14:38.497\nVOM scans, all kinds of scans,\nand look-ats, okay?\n\n285\n00:14:38.497 --> 00:14:40.855\nThen we can tell you,\nhere's your remediation plan,\n\n286\n00:14:40.855 --> 00:14:43.810\nyou can do these parts yourself and\nthese parts we can help you with.\n\n287\n00:14:43.810 --> 00:14:45.280\nThis is what it's gonna cost, etc.\n\n288\n00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:47.700\n&gt;&gt; That's where the roadmap\ncomes into play.\n\n289\n00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:48.310\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n290\n00:14:48.310 --> 00:14:52.840\n&gt;&gt; So from the remediation plan and\nunderstanding where you are and where you\n\n291\n00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:56.780\nneed to go, then how you get there,\nthat's how you build out your roadmap.\n\n292\n00:14:56.780 --> 00:14:59.760\nOnce you've gone through your roadmap and\nyou've done your\n\n293\n00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:05.770\nAudit on the backend of the roadmap, then\nwe come in and do a reassessment, right?\n\n294\n00:15:05.770 --> 00:15:08.150\n&gt;&gt; So\nthis goes back to what we were saying.\n\n295\n00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:12.180\nIt's a gap analysis,\nthen it's a remediation,\n\n296\n00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:16.760\nthen it's reassess and it goes\nthrough a full step and you iterate.\n\n297\n00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:18.537\nThink of this almost as like\nagile compliance, okay?\n\n298\n00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:23.200\nYou do a Gap analysis,\nyou figure out what your backlog is.\n\n299\n00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:25.750\nYou do your remediation, which is\nwhen you're actually doing the work,\n\n300\n00:15:25.750 --> 00:15:29.610\nyou're doing sprints, and with\n800-171 you can do a sprint at a time.\n\n301\n00:15:29.610 --> 00:15:31.690\nYou can do multiple sprints,\nit all depends.\n\n302\n00:15:31.690 --> 00:15:34.240\nAnd then you do a reassess, which is\nwhere you do the stand up meeting and go,\n\n303\n00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:36.560\nhow did we do, okay?\n\n304\n00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:38.350\nSo it's almost like agile compliance.\n\n305\n00:15:38.350 --> 00:15:42.100\nAnd we prefer to do it that way rather\nthan a waterfall compliance method.\n\n306\n00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:44.460\nI'm bastardizing a little bit,\nbear with me.\n\n307\n00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:45.712\nBecause at waterfall compliance,\n\n308\n00:15:45.712 --> 00:15:48.460\nwe're gonna charge you a quarter of\na million dollars, we get it all done.\n\n309\n00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:49.310\nWell, I don't know that.\n\n310\n00:15:49.310 --> 00:15:51.930\nIt might cost $70000 and\nbe able to do everything.\n\n311\n00:15:51.930 --> 00:15:53.630\nIt might cost a half a million dollars and\n\n312\n00:15:53.630 --> 00:15:55.536\nthose other guys are gonna\nshort change you.\n\n313\n00:15:55.536 --> 00:15:59.821\nWe prefer to do in a step by step basis\nbecause it also helps to make the budget\n\n314\n00:15:59.821 --> 00:16:04.110\na bit more understandable and\npalatable For everybody including the CFO,\n\n315\n00:16:04.110 --> 00:16:07.940\nwho'll likely be upset with you if\nyou throw it at them in one lump.\n\n316\n00:16:08.950 --> 00:16:12.330\n&gt;&gt; So, if I have cyber insurance,\nwill this actually make a difference for\n\n317\n00:16:12.330 --> 00:16:13.510\nmy insurance company?\n\n318\n00:16:13.510 --> 00:16:14.480\n&gt;&gt; It can.\n\n319\n00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:19.460\n&gt;&gt; We have talked with a lot of\ncyber insurers that are out there.\n\n320\n00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:23.500\nAnd we've seen the questionnaires that\ncyber insurance companies have asked.\n\n321\n00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:25.720\nAnd they range a full gambit.\n\n322\n00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:26.950\n&gt;&gt; God.\n&gt;&gt; From,\n\n323\n00:16:26.950 --> 00:16:30.090\nwe'll give you a million dollars if you\ntell us that you have bought a firewall.\n\n324\n00:16:30.090 --> 00:16:31.290\nYou don't have to install it.\n\n325\n00:16:31.290 --> 00:16:33.240\nYou don't have to have it running.\n\n326\n00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:36.755\nIt can be sitting on a shelf in a box,\nbut you've bought one, right.\n\n327\n00:16:36.755 --> 00:16:39.480\nTwo yes we have a fully built out program.\n\n328\n00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:44.630\nWe ask our people to re-up their\ncertifications every so often.\n\n329\n00:16:44.630 --> 00:16:46.360\nAnd that's what the basis\nof our insurance is.\n\n330\n00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:48.880\nSo does 171 actually make a difference?\n\n331\n00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:52.660\n&gt;&gt; 171 can absolutely make a difference\nif you're a federal contractor\n\n332\n00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:56.780\na sub do federal contractor or sub do\na sub do a sub do federal contractor and\n\n333\n00:16:56.780 --> 00:17:02.010\nyou're and you have a contract and\nyou do not have 800-171 compliance by\n\n334\n00:17:02.010 --> 00:17:05.850\nthe end of 2017 you stand a very good\nchance of losing that contract all right.\n\n335\n00:17:05.850 --> 00:17:10.820\nI've talked to prime contractors who have\nhad their government lease on say hey.\n\n336\n00:17:10.820 --> 00:17:13.260\nYou see this clause in the contract where\nit says you have to be compliant for\n\n337\n00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:14.390\ninformation security?\n\n338\n00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:17.258\nThis time, we're holding you to that.\n\n339\n00:17:17.258 --> 00:17:20.887\nAs of December 31 2017,\nif you are not compliant with 800171,\n\n340\n00:17:20.887 --> 00:17:23.220\nyou can pretty much kiss\nthat contract goodbye.\n\n341\n00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:26.290\nNow-\n&gt;&gt; So you're saying that\n\n342\n00:17:26.290 --> 00:17:29.510\nif I own cyber insurance\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n343\n00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:34.080\n&gt;&gt; Right, if I own cyber insurance or\nI do any type of government contracting,\n\n344\n00:17:35.530 --> 00:17:40.980\nthat it's gonna care that like it\nreally I should really care about this.\n\n345\n00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:41.810\n&gt;&gt; So you should care.\n\n346\n00:17:41.810 --> 00:17:44.360\nAnd you should care even if you\nare not a government contractor.\n\n347\n00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:47.420\nLook cyber insurance, okay so\nthis three things that matter.\n\n348\n00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:48.690\nAre you a government contractor?\n\n349\n00:17:48.690 --> 00:17:50.660\nIf not, okay ignore that one.\n\n350\n00:17:50.660 --> 00:17:53.330\nDo you have customers, because if you have\ncustomers and you go hey, by the way,\n\n351\n00:17:53.330 --> 00:17:57.420\ncustomer, we have a risk management\nprogram and we are having a security\n\n352\n00:17:57.420 --> 00:18:02.258\nmaturity issue that we've fixed and we are\nmature in the information security realm.\n\n353\n00:18:02.258 --> 00:18:05.350\nThey go wow,\nI'm much happier dealing with you now,\n\n354\n00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:07.290\nbecause I know you're actually secure.\n\n355\n00:18:07.290 --> 00:18:10.220\nAnd you go hey cyber insurance vendor,\nbecause these days if you don't have\n\n356\n00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:15.510\ncyber insurance, you're in trouble anyway\nI have an information security program.\n\n357\n00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:18.400\nI have an information security system.\n\n358\n00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:19.990\nWe're up to date on everything.\n\n359\n00:18:19.990 --> 00:18:21.420\nI have a risk management framework.\n\n360\n00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:22.700\nWe're doing really good.\n\n361\n00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:23.700\nHow do you like it?\n\n362\n00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:27.350\nAnd your cyber insurance company's\ngonna go, hey, wow you're awesome.\n\n363\n00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:28.736\nYour premium could go down.\n\n364\n00:18:28.736 --> 00:18:31.788\nThey could very much be happy with you\nin terms of if you put in a claim,\n\n365\n00:18:31.788 --> 00:18:34.950\nthey're gonna go no, no, no,\nthese guys actually did good stuff.\n\n366\n00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:37.380\nIf they put in a claim,\nsomething really bad happened,\n\n367\n00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:41.420\npay the claim faster; you're gonna have\nproof that any claims that you put in\n\n368\n00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:44.420\nare legitimate faster because\nyou're going to be logging things.\n\n369\n00:18:44.420 --> 00:18:45.790\nSo, my god, you care!\n\n370\n00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:51.143\nOkay, even if you're not a government\ncontractor if you have customers or\n\n371\n00:18:51.143 --> 00:18:53.296\ncyber insurance or both, you care.\n\n372\n00:18:53.296 --> 00:18:58.097\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\nwe have outlined a whole bunch of things\n\n373\n00:18:58.097 --> 00:19:03.337\nabout 171 even though this is brief and\nshort, right.\n\n374\n00:19:03.337 --> 00:19:08.830\nYeah so where do we go from here?\n\n375\n00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:10.140\nThat's the question.\n\n376\n00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:11.450\n&gt;&gt; That's a great question.\n\n377\n00:19:11.450 --> 00:19:12.790\nSo the answer is simple.\n\n378\n00:19:12.790 --> 00:19:15.632\nIf you have questions please\ngive us a call ask us,\n\n379\n00:19:15.632 --> 00:19:18.910\nemail us,\nour emails are in the presentation.\n\n380\n00:19:18.910 --> 00:19:22.070\nI am Joshua Marpet Jmarpet@redlion.io.\n\n381\n00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:25.162\n&gt;&gt;

Old nickname of his.\n\n385\n00:19:31.180 --> 00:19:32.830\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; Effectively,\n\n386\n00:19:32.830 --> 00:19:37.280\nwhat we wanna do is show you that it's not\nthat hard to do a compliance framework,\n\n387\n00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:41.380\nto be compliant, to do risk management,\nto increase your security maturity.\n\n388\n00:19:41.380 --> 00:19:43.401\nIt takes time, it takes effort,\nit takes some money.\n\n389\n00:19:43.401 --> 00:19:46.538\nBut, what it really takes is\na determination that I'm gonna reduce my\n\n390\n00:19:46.538 --> 00:19:49.889\nsales friction, I'm gonna increase my\nlikelihood that I can actually get\n\n391\n00:19:49.889 --> 00:19:53.504\na successful claim in cyber insurance,\nand I'm gonna make myself a better way,\n\n392\n00:19:53.504 --> 00:19:57.012\na better company to be a government\ncontractor or sub do government contractor\n\n393\n00:19:57.012 --> 00:20:00.120\nto get some of those beautiful\nlarge government contracts.\n\n394\n00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:01.335\nAnd if you do these things,\n\n395\n00:20:01.335 --> 00:20:04.030\nyour business is probably gonna succeed\na lot better then if you didn't.\n\n396\n00:20:04.030 --> 00:20:07.480\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and foremost,\nit also is a great reduction in risk.\n\n397\n00:20:08.530 --> 00:20:10.100\n&gt;&gt; Not a bad thing.\n\n398\n00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:16.286\nSo that's NIST 800-171 the basics and\n\n399\n00:20:16.286 --> 00:20:23.273\nthank you very much for\njoining us here at BIZPRO.TV\n\n",
