Sure thing.\n\n9\n00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:23.430\nSo hi everybody.\n\n10\n00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.300\nI am the CEO of Red Lion.\n\n11\n00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:31.270\nI am a graduate of the business of,\ngeez, I can't even speak right now.\n\n12\n00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:35.230\nThe school of hard knocks when\nit comes to business, right?\n\n13\n00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:39.500\nI am a peer review on SYNACK\nthe Info Sec journal.\n\n14\n00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.440\nI do hold certifications although\nI won't tell you which, right?\n\n15\n00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.730\nAnd my real passion are people and\nbusiness.\n\n16\n00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:45.230\nJosh.\n\n17\n00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.940\n&gt;&gt; So my name's Joshua Marpet, I'm the COO\nof Red Lion, Chief Operating Officer.\n\n18\n00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.410\nI've been around the block more than once.\n\n19\n00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:53.690\nYou've probably heard me say this but\n\n20\n00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.265\nI'm an ex-cop, I'm an ex-fireman, I'm\nan ex horse dentist, I'm an ex-blacksmith.\n\n21\n00:00:57.265 --> 00:00:59.840\nN,o that's not a joke, that's actually me.\n\n22\n00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.260\nI've been a jail guard,\n\n23\n00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.430\nI've done just about everything except\nastronaut, and I'm working on that.\n\n24\n00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:07.341\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\n\n25\n00:01:07.341 --> 00:01:12.480\nI run Security BSides Delaware\nalong with Janice Paulson.\n\n26\n00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.902\nAnd occasionally I get to sleep,\nit's an amazing thing, so.\n\n27\n00:01:15.902 --> 00:01:19.850\n&gt;&gt; So today let's talk about\nwhat we're getting into, right?\n\n28\n00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.760\nSo, we're dealing with the 171, okay.\n\n29\n00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.990\nWe need to know who is NIST?\n\n30\n00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.530\nWe need to know what the heck 171 is.\n\n31\n00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.173\nHow does it translate to entities\nthat deal with the government?\n\n32\n00:01:32.173 --> 00:01:34.455\nHow does it change process?\n\n33\n00:01:34.455 --> 00:01:38.050\nHow does it change the certification,\nright?\n\n34\n00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:39.394\nWhat is the certification?\n\n35\n00:01:39.394 --> 00:01:41.108\nWhat is the cost associated?\n\n36\n00:01:41.108 --> 00:01:45.710\nAnd some other general Q and A about 171.\n\n37\n00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.770\nSo let's start of with NIST.\n\n38\n00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:50.260\nNIST is the National Institute\nof Standards and\n\n39\n00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:55.960\nTechnology it is developed by the US\nDepartment of Commerce, founded in 1901.\n\n40\n00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.280\nNIST is responsible for\n\n41\n00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.920\na lot of the major certification projects\nthat you'll find with the US Government.\n\n42\n00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.990\nFrom 5g wireless standards to Biopharms\n\n43\n00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:11.110\nto ICS/SCADA which is industrial\ncontrol systems, all right?\n\n44\n00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:12.700\n&gt;&gt; All the way to bullet proof vests.\n\n45\n00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:13.270\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n46\n00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.045\n&gt;&gt; It's really cool,\nthey get to shoot people.\n\n47\n00:02:15.045 --> 00:02:16.880\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Man.\n\n48\n00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.990\nSo NIST is actually responsible for\na lot of what drives government standards.\n\n49\n00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:28.370\nNow, with that being said, we need to take\na look at what 171 is specific around.\n\n50\n00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.130\nAnd that really is the protection\nof controlled information for\n\n51\n00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:35.350\nunclassified systems.\n\n52\n00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:41.640\nAnd that is around non-federal,\nit is around information systems.\n\n53\n00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.480\nSo basically, go ahead Josh.\n\n54\n00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.170\n&gt;&gt; What we're talking about is you've\ngot to pull the important terms out\n\n55\n00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.970\nof that title.\n\n56\n00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.530\nOkay, the full title of NIST 800-171 is\n\n57\n00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.570\nProtecting Controlled Unclassified\nInformation, CUI, by the way is\n\n58\n00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:58.220\nthe abbreviation, in Non-federal\nInformation Systems and Organizations.\n\n59\n00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.616\nOkay, so it's protecting information\nthat's not in a classification scheme, for\n\n60\n00:03:02.616 --> 00:03:04.370\nnon-federal agencies.\n\n61\n00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.120\nWhy would NIST care about that?\n\n62\n00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.070\n&gt;&gt; I don't know.\n\n63\n00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:09.470\nWhy would NIST care about that?\n\n64\n00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:14.460\nReally what we're looking at the access,\nwe're looking at security requirements\n\n65\n00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:20.060\nbased around access control,\nbased around identity and authentication.\n\n66\n00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:21.600\nBased around incident response and\n\n67\n00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.510\nmaintenance, based around\npersonnel security.\n\n68\n00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.830\n&gt;&gt; So Scott, this looks like a serious\ninformation security program, and\n\n69\n00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:29.820\na fairly complete one.\n\n70\n00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:31.500\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; You've got all the identification,\n\n71\n00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.490\nyou got the accountability,\nyou've got all the training,\n\n72\n00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:37.690\nsort of every piece of a information\nsecurity program is here.\n\n73\n00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.060\nBut this is specifically for\nnon-federal agencies and\n\n74\n00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.870\norganizations for\nunclassified information.\n\n75\n00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:47.030\nI mean, who does this apply to?\n\n76\n00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:50.580\n&gt;&gt; Well, it applies a lot to companies\nthat wanna do business with the federal\n\n77\n00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:52.460\ngovernment, right?\n\n78\n00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:58.600\nSo the real question is, Josh,\nif I may, why do I care, right?\n\n79\n00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:04.730\nWell, why I care is because either I\nhave to be a part of DFARS, right?\n\n80\n00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:05.470\n&gt;&gt; What's DFARS?\n\n81\n00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:09.500\n&gt;&gt; DFARS,\nthe DOD Federal Acquisition Resource?\n\n82\n00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:10.190\n&gt;&gt; Regulations.\n\n83\n00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:14.470\n&gt;&gt; Regulations, or FARS,\nthe Federal Acquisition Regulations.\n\n84\n00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:15.240\nThank you.\n\n85\n00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:19.180\nAm I a government contractor because,\nguess what, I care.\n\n86\n00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:25.700\nAm I sub to a sub to a sub to a sub,\nI still have to deal with 171, right?\n\n87\n00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:29.680\nBut the question I say is, why not 27001?\n\n88\n00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:34.422\n&gt;&gt; Well because 27001 is incredibly\nparticular it's a detailed-oriented\n\n89\n00:04:34.422 --> 00:04:35.419\nbeyond belief.\n\n90\n00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:39.821\n800-171 is a significant\namount easier than ISO 27001.\n\n91\n00:04:39.821 --> 00:04:42.295\nIt's a little more far reaching, but\n\n92\n00:04:42.295 --> 00:04:47.020\nISO 27001 is the OCD cousin\nof 800171 if you will.\n\n93\n00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:50.435\nSo it also is a nice stepping stone it\nhelps you build to the next cyber security\n\n94\n00:04:50.435 --> 00:04:51.442\nframework, the CSL.\n\n95\n00:04:51.442 --> 00:04:55.380\nSo effectively, if you care about this\nyou're either a government contractor,\n\n96\n00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:59.504\nyou're a government sub to a contractor,\nor sub to a government contractor rather.\n\n97\n00:04:59.504 --> 00:05:02.202\nYou need to prove that\nyou're following a risk\n\n98\n00:05:02.202 --> 00:05:04.630\nmanagement program of some sort, okay?\n\n99\n00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:07.450\nFor a sale, for a customer,\nfor a supplier, for\n\n100\n00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:09.940\na regulatory regime of some sort.\n\n101\n00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:12.450\nAnd you go, you know, 800 one\nsomething one doesn't sound so bad.\n\n102\n00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:16.950\nIt's understandable those families\nof controls that we just looked at\n\n103\n00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:21.090\nare totally literally realistic,\nthey're reasonable.\n\n104\n00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:26.810\n&gt;&gt; They are and so 171 actually\nbreaks down the four main steps and\n\n105\n00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:30.760\nthose are Review, Implement,\nAnalyze, and Audit.\n\n106\n00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:32.740\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\nlet's talk about each of them real quick.\n\n107\n00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:33.360\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n108\n00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:36.488\n&gt;&gt; So in Review,\nyou're gonna go over what you have now.\n\n109\n00:05:36.488 --> 00:05:40.898\nYou're gonna see, hey I'm right here,\nand you're going to go, hum,\n\n110\n00:05:40.898 --> 00:05:43.070\nthey need me to be over here.\n\n111\n00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:45.920\nSo how do I get from A to B?\n\n112\n00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:46.960\nAnd that's implement.\n\n113\n00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:48.830\nThis leads to each other very very nicely.\n\n114\n00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:49.840\n&gt;&gt; It does.\n\n115\n00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:51.070\n&gt;&gt; So\nyou're going to review what you have.\n\n116\n00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:54.260\nYou're going to review what you are,\nyour business process, and your CUI.\n\n117\n00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.740\nIn other words,\nwhat information do I have?\n\n118\n00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:01.480\nThat's data classification, that's\nmanaging your assets, asset inventory.\n\n119\n00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:04.610\nThat's knowing who has\naccess to those assets.\n\n120\n00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:09.510\nThat's understanding your business\nprocesses around those assets,\n\n121\n00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:11.880\naround that date,\naround those classifications.\n\n122\n00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:14.240\nAnd then realizing that I have a gap,\nI have a risk,\n\n123\n00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:16.780\nI have a problem I need to fix that.\n\n124\n00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:20.940\nSo, I'm gonna implement some controls,\nsome segmentation, some new processes.\n\n125\n00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:25.870\nModify the existing ones or\nwhatever, and then.\n\n126\n00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:27.810\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna step right in to analyze.\n\n127\n00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:31.720\nSo let's make sure that we've done\nour review correctly, we've done our\n\n128\n00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:35.800\nimplementation correctly, which really\nleads us to a controls gap, right?\n\n129\n00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:39.550\nSo where are we, where are we headed and\nhow do we get there right?\n\n130\n00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:43.230\nAnd that's really your gap, that's where\na good gap analysis comes into place.\n\n131\n00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:45.710\n&gt;&gt; Well, right, and so\nthen we've done our review.\n\n132\n00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:49.090\nWe've implemented to fix the gap,\nwe've analyzed to make sure that we fixed\n\n133\n00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:52.510\nthe gap, this is basically the double\ncheck, and then we're gonna audit.\n\n134\n00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:55.580\nAnd the audit is gonna be where we say,\nwe are actually in compliance,\n\n135\n00:06:55.580 --> 00:07:00.740\nwe are validating, we are verifying,\nwe are making sure we're doing it right.\n\n136\n00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:05.060\n&gt;&gt; But the audit also comes into play\nwhen trying to deal with your road map.\n\n137\n00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:11.530\nThe roadmap basically says, how we're\ngoing to implement the entire solution.\n\n138\n00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:15.140\nWhen you audit, it's not that\nyou're auditing for a compliance.\n\n139\n00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:19.630\nSure, that might be something\ngained to help your business but,\n\n140\n00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:22.830\nat the same time, you're really auditing,\nand a lot of companies miss this,\n\n141\n00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:26.190\nyou're auditing to make sure that\nyou're matching your roadmap.\n\n142\n00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:28.144\n&gt;&gt; Well agreed, agreed.\n\n143\n00:07:28.144 --> 00:07:33.295\nSo your road map, or your strategic\nroad map really, says that I want to be,\n\n144\n00:07:33.295 --> 00:07:38.280\nlet's say, I wanna have 5000 new\ncustomers by the end of the year.\n\n145\n00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:41.790\nThose customers are gonna be in\nthe government space, those customers\n\n146\n00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:46.340\nare gonna want me to be certified or\nat least secure in some form or fashion.\n\n147\n00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:49.726\nWe're gonna use 800-171 to show them that\nwe have a risk management framework.\n\n148\n00:07:49.726 --> 00:07:53.015\nTo get 800-171, we're going to make\nsure that we've done our gap analysis,\n\n149\n00:07:53.015 --> 00:07:55.665\nwe're gonna make sure that we've analyzed,\nwe've implemented,\n\n150\n00:07:55.665 --> 00:07:57.001\nwe've taken care of everything.\n\n151\n00:07:57.001 --> 00:08:00.503\nWe're gonna use this as a stepping stone\nin that road map to get all those new\n\n152\n00:08:00.503 --> 00:08:04.075\ncustomers, to get all that new business,\nto get all those things going on.\n\n153\n00:08:04.075 --> 00:08:06.490\nOkay, so the government has come down and\n\n154\n00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:10.490\nsaid that all DOD contractors\nmust be 171 compliant by what?\n\n155\n00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:12.870\nDecember 31st?\n\n156\n00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:13.370\n&gt;&gt; 2017.\n&gt;&gt; Of 2017, right.\n\n157\n00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:13.920\nSo\n\n158\n00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:17.862\nmy real question to you is how\ndoes this relate to our business?\n\n159\n00:08:17.862 --> 00:08:18.535\n&gt;&gt; That easy.\n\n160\n00:08:18.535 --> 00:08:20.185\nAre you a government contractor?\n\n161\n00:08:20.185 --> 00:08:22.105\nAre you a sub to a government contractor?\n\n162\n00:08:22.105 --> 00:08:24.105\nAre you a sub to a sub to a sub to a sub?\n\n163\n00:08:24.105 --> 00:08:26.755\nAre you anywhere in\nthe supplier value chain?\n\n164\n00:08:26.755 --> 00:08:28.626\nThose terms by the way mean\nroughly the same thing,\n\n165\n00:08:28.626 --> 00:08:30.814\nit's just different people\nuse them differently, okay?\n\n166\n00:08:30.814 --> 00:08:34.765\nIf you are a supplier, if you are the\nperson actually doing the work, if you\n\n167\n00:08:34.765 --> 00:08:39.000\nare a customer, that is a value chain\nfrom supplier to processor to customer.\n\n168\n00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.088\nIf you're in that value chain anywhere,\nand by the way, there's are more,\n\n169\n00:08:42.088 --> 00:08:45.740\nthere's what,\n6,000 subcontractors to the government?\n\n170\n00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:47.510\n&gt;&gt; There's a lot.\n\n171\n00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:49.360\n&gt;&gt; So if there's 6,000\nsubcontractors to the government,\n\n172\n00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:51.990\nhow many subcontractors do they have?\n\n173\n00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:53.720\nDear God, the number is huge.\n\n174\n00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:56.690\nNow, there's also other\nreasons to use 800-171, or\n\n175\n00:08:56.690 --> 00:08:58.360\nany good risk management framework.\n\n176\n00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:00.350\nDo you wanna reduce your sales friction?\n\n177\n00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:04.150\nIf you go, hey,\nI'd like to sign up for ITPro.TV and\n\n178\n00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:05.700\nI wanna give you my credit card.\n\n179\n00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:09.210\nAnd they go, hey, we have managed to\nsecure your credit card information\n\n180\n00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:14.470\nbecause we are PCI compliant or\nusing a PCI compliant payment processor,\n\n181\n00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:16.600\nyou go, hey, I feel better about this.\n\n182\n00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:19.210\nI feel better about putting my\ncredit card in those little boxes\n\n183\n00:09:19.210 --> 00:09:22.500\nbecause I know that they're doing\nit in a secure fashion, okay?\n\n184\n00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:25.100\nAnd that's how you get it,\nyou reduce sales friction.\n\n185\n00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:28.160\nIf somebody said, hey, would you mind\nmailing me, snail mailing me, or faxing\n\n186\n00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:31.900\nme, that's fine, just send me a copy of\nyour credit card, would you feel secure?\n\n187\n00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:32.880\nCuz I know I wouldn't.\n\n188\n00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:38.060\n&gt;&gt; Right, so how does this affect your\nDFARS and your FARS standing, right?\n\n189\n00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:42.660\nAs a federal resource\nwe need to figure out\n\n190\n00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:47.730\nthe easiest way to move all of this\nforward and still be compliant, right?\n\n191\n00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:52.813\nSo understanding your contracting\nofficer and what their technical\n\n192\n00:09:52.813 --> 00:09:58.958\nrequirements are according to the FARS and\nthe DFARS will really help with 171.\n\n193\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:04.875\nBecause originally we used to have to deal\nwith 853 which was [INAUDIBLE] as what,\n\n194\n00:10:04.875 --> 00:10:06.489\nISO 27000\n&gt;&gt; 1 and 2.\n\n195\n00:10:06.489 --> 00:10:10.940\n&gt;&gt; 1 and 2, right.\nSo we've taken the medium listing for 853,\n\n196\n00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:15.020\nsprinkled in some ISO 27000 1 and 2, and\n\n197\n00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:19.696\nthat's how we got to 171\n&gt;&gt; Right so they're a little off topic,\n\n198\n00:10:19.696 --> 00:10:22.220\nbut there's a little bit more to that.\n\n199\n00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:24.730\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And the reason is that 853 is a pre\n\n200\n00:10:24.730 --> 00:10:25.670\nscriptive standard.\n\n201\n00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:28.995\n853 says you will do this,\nand this, and this.\n\n202\n00:10:28.995 --> 00:10:34.030\n800-171 is a descriptive standard, it says\nit will protect against these attacks.\n\n203\n00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:37.550\nHow you do it is up to you, because these\nthings change on, well, let's be honest,\n\n204\n00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:38.430\na daily basis.\n\n205\n00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:39.170\n&gt;&gt; They do.\n\n206\n00:10:39.170 --> 00:10:42.110\n&gt;&gt; But if you are protected\nagainst these types of attacks,\n\n207\n00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:43.540\nyou are following the standard.\n\n208\n00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:48.400\n&gt;&gt; Okay, okay, so seeing that we're\nprotected against these types of attacks,\n\n209\n00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:51.730\nright The real question is do I have\nto change the business process?\n\n210\n00:10:51.730 --> 00:10:52.300\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n211\n00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:53.490\n&gt;&gt; Because a lot of what we do,\n\n212\n00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:57.910\na lot of what we do and\na lot of what we say is that no matter\n\n213\n00:10:57.910 --> 00:11:02.130\nwhat you do as far as complain goes you\nhave to tailor to the business, right?\n\n214\n00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:07.530\nSo do do we change business process,\nmaybe, right.\n\n215\n00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:09.400\n&gt;&gt; It might be.\n\n216\n00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:13.790\nBut the thing is, here's the thing,\nit depends on your security maturity.\n\n217\n00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:17.610\nIt depends on your existing processes, it\ndepends on your risk management framework.\n\n218\n00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:19.330\nIf you're not using risk management,\n\n219\n00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:21.770\nif you don't have existing\nbusiness processes.\n\n220\n00:11:21.770 --> 00:11:25.460\nIf you don't have a high enough security\nmaturity, or any information security\n\n221\n00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:28.700\nmaturity, physical security\nmaturity all these different types.\n\n222\n00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:31.710\nThen yeah, you're gonna probably have to\nchange some of your business processes.\n\n223\n00:11:31.710 --> 00:11:34.360\nIf you've already built up a very,\nvery secure,\n\n224\n00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:39.310\nvery mature system of information physical\nsecurity, and you've got risk management,\n\n225\n00:11:39.310 --> 00:11:41.150\nyou're doing risk-based thinking.\n\n226\n00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:44.000\nYou're saying, I've got an asset\nworth $1,000, I'm spending $500 for\n\n227\n00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.760\nprotection, I'm protected up to this\nlevel, you're risk thinking, okay?\n\n228\n00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:49.640\nYou're thinking about your risk.\n\n229\n00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:50.240\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; You're probably\n\n230\n00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:53.660\nwon't have to change your processes at all\nor not very much, maybe a little tiny bit.\n\n231\n00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:57.450\n&gt;&gt; So if we go onto the next,\nwe're asking just a simple question here.\n\n232\n00:11:57.450 --> 00:11:58.850\nDo we really need to get certified?\n\n233\n00:11:58.850 --> 00:12:04.740\nIs there a certifying body for 171 that's\nbeen set up or, is it sort of like HIPAA\n\n234\n00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:10.090\nin that you say you're HIPAA certified but\nthere's really no paper for it?\n\n235\n00:12:10.090 --> 00:12:14.193\n&gt;&gt; So the contractors, remember we're\ntalking government contractors primarily,\n\n236\n00:12:14.193 --> 00:12:17.731\nthey're sort of the main receiving body or\naudience for this standard.\n\n237\n00:12:17.731 --> 00:12:21.507\nThe government contractors have no\nauditing body for this officially set up,\n\n238\n00:12:21.507 --> 00:12:25.392\nbut, of course, they can be audited by\nthe agency that are their customers at any\n\n239\n00:12:25.392 --> 00:12:28.676\ntime, or the prime contractors that\nare the customers at any time.\n\n240\n00:12:28.676 --> 00:12:32.081\nSo, while it's more like HIPAA,\nin that, there are audit protocols, and\n\n241\n00:12:32.081 --> 00:12:35.115\naudit standards, that have been set up so\nthat they can be audited,\n\n242\n00:12:35.115 --> 00:12:38.870\nthere's no real way to get that stamp of\napproval that says, funk, you're good.\n\n243\n00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:43.089\nSo it's a problem,\nthat's a real problem, you don't know.\n\n244\n00:12:43.089 --> 00:12:45.694\nYou go we're compliant according\nto our compliance officer,\n\n245\n00:12:45.694 --> 00:12:48.556\naccording to our paperwork,\naccording to everything we've done.\n\n246\n00:12:48.556 --> 00:12:51.061\nBut just like anybody can say,\nI see a problem, well,\n\n247\n00:12:51.061 --> 00:12:52.540\nwe didn't see a problem there.\n\n248\n00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:55.300\nWell, I do in my interpretation\nof the standards, and\n\n249\n00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:57.100\nthat's where the problem arises.\n\n250\n00:12:57.100 --> 00:13:00.060\n&gt;&gt; So right now, to help you out\na little bit, you're saying it's more of\n\n251\n00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:03.620\na self-certification process\nthan anything else, right?\n\n252\n00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:04.240\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n\n253\n00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:05.410\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; It absolutely is and\n\n254\n00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:08.530\nthat's fantastic because it means\nthat you can do it at your own pace.\n\n255\n00:13:08.530 --> 00:13:09.940\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; It means you can do it with your own\n\n256\n00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:10.580\nresources.\n\n257\n00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:13.170\nIt means you can really\nget very far down the path\n\n258\n00:13:13.170 --> 00:13:16.920\nwithout bringing in a huge\nmonstrous consulting company.\n\n259\n00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:20.640\nYou might bring in a trusted advisor who\nsays, hey, let's start with this plan,\n\n260\n00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:23.860\nlet's have these as goals,\nlet's do one piece at a time.\n\n261\n00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:26.620\nYou can do it slow and steady,\nvery stable, very comfortable and\n\n262\n00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:29.070\nnot totally upsetting\nthe apple cart if you will.\n\n263\n00:13:29.070 --> 00:13:31.650\nOn the other hand,\nit does cause problems sometimes.\n\n264\n00:13:31.650 --> 00:13:34.990\n&gt;&gt; So, that really runs us\ninto the question of cost.\n\n265\n00:13:36.050 --> 00:13:36.580\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n266\n00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:40.360\n&gt;&gt; A lot of companies try to budget for\nthings that they know.\n\n267\n00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:44.210\nThey try to budget for what they\ndon't know but more often then not,\n\n268\n00:13:44.210 --> 00:13:46.890\nthat budgeting gets\nblown out of the water.\n\n269\n00:13:46.890 --> 00:13:51.060\nWould something like this,\ngiven what needs to happen,\n\n270\n00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:53.220\nblow our budget under the water\nif you are not careful.\n\n271\n00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:56.320\n&gt;&gt; It depends, so,\nlet's go over budgeting.\n\n272\n00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:59.540\nOkay, this, I should be very honest and\n\n273\n00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:03.070\ntell you that this is very specific\nto Red Lion's way of doing business.\n\n274\n00:14:03.070 --> 00:14:09.060\nThere is no one god given way to do this,\nbut there are quite a few ways to do it.\n\n275\n00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:12.490\nWe like to do a gap analysis because we\nbelieve that we don't know how much it's\n\n276\n00:14:12.490 --> 00:14:14.860\ngonna cost until we know\nwhere you stand right now.\n\n277\n00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:17.450\nWe already know what the regulations\nsay you have to do and be and\n\n278\n00:14:17.450 --> 00:14:19.810\nwhere you have to end up.\n\n279\n00:14:19.810 --> 00:14:21.190\nBut we don't know where you are now.\n\n280\n00:14:21.190 --> 00:14:23.960\nSo unless we know that how\ncan we tell you the cost?\n\n281\n00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:27.060\nSo we tend to do a gap analysis that takes\nanywhere from two to four weeks, and\n\n282\n00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:29.324\ncosts somewhere between 10 and $50,000.\n\n283\n00:14:29.324 --> 00:14:34.496\nAll right, that's on site, offsite,\ninterviews, investigation,\n\n284\n00:14:34.496 --> 00:14:38.497\nVOM scans, all kinds of scans,\nand look-ats, okay?\n\n285\n00:14:38.497 --> 00:14:40.855\nThen we can tell you,\nhere's your remediation plan,\n\n286\n00:14:40.855 --> 00:14:43.810\nyou can do these parts yourself and\nthese parts we can help you with.\n\n287\n00:14:43.810 --> 00:14:45.280\nThis is what it's gonna cost, etc.\n\n288\n00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:47.700\n&gt;&gt; That's where the roadmap\ncomes into play.\n\n289\n00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:48.310\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n290\n00:14:48.310 --> 00:14:52.840\n&gt;&gt; So from the remediation plan and\nunderstanding where you are and where you\n\n291\n00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:56.780\nneed to go, then how you get there,\nthat's how you build out your roadmap.\n\n292\n00:14:56.780 --> 00:14:59.760\nOnce you've gone through your roadmap and\nyou've done your\n\n293\n00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:05.770\nAudit on the backend of the roadmap, then\nwe come in and do a reassessment, right?\n\n294\n00:15:05.770 --> 00:15:08.150\n&gt;&gt; So\nthis goes back to what we were saying.\n\n295\n00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:12.180\nIt's a gap analysis,\nthen it's a remediation,\n\n296\n00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:16.760\nthen it's reassess and it goes\nthrough a full step and you iterate.\n\n297\n00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:18.537\nThink of this almost as like\nagile compliance, okay?\n\n298\n00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:23.200\nYou do a Gap analysis,\nyou figure out what your backlog is.\n\n299\n00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:25.750\nYou do your remediation, which is\nwhen you're actually doing the work,\n\n300\n00:15:25.750 --> 00:15:29.610\nyou're doing sprints, and with\n800-171 you can do a sprint at a time.\n\n301\n00:15:29.610 --> 00:15:31.690\nYou can do multiple sprints,\nit all depends.\n\n302\n00:15:31.690 --> 00:15:34.240\nAnd then you do a reassess, which is\nwhere you do the stand up meeting and go,\n\n303\n00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:36.560\nhow did we do, okay?\n\n304\n00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:38.350\nSo it's almost like agile compliance.\n\n305\n00:15:38.350 --> 00:15:42.100\nAnd we prefer to do it that way rather\nthan a waterfall compliance method.\n\n306\n00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:44.460\nI'm bastardizing a little bit,\nbear with me.\n\n307\n00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:45.712\nBecause at waterfall compliance,\n\n308\n00:15:45.712 --> 00:15:48.460\nwe're gonna charge you a quarter of\na million dollars, we get it all done.\n\n309\n00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:49.310\nWell, I don't know that.\n\n310\n00:15:49.310 --> 00:15:51.930\nIt might cost $70000 and\nbe able to do everything.\n\n311\n00:15:51.930 --> 00:15:53.630\nIt might cost a half a million dollars and\n\n312\n00:15:53.630 --> 00:15:55.536\nthose other guys are gonna\nshort change you.\n\n313\n00:15:55.536 --> 00:15:59.821\nWe prefer to do in a step by step basis\nbecause it also helps to make the budget\n\n314\n00:15:59.821 --> 00:16:04.110\na bit more understandable and\npalatable For everybody including the CFO,\n\n315\n00:16:04.110 --> 00:16:07.940\nwho'll likely be upset with you if\nyou throw it at them in one lump.\n\n316\n00:16:08.950 --> 00:16:12.330\n&gt;&gt; So, if I have cyber insurance,\nwill this actually make a difference for\n\n317\n00:16:12.330 --> 00:16:13.510\nmy insurance company?\n\n318\n00:16:13.510 --> 00:16:14.480\n&gt;&gt; It can.\n\n319\n00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:19.460\n&gt;&gt; We have talked with a lot of\ncyber insurers that are out there.\n\n320\n00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:23.500\nAnd we've seen the questionnaires that\ncyber insurance companies have asked.\n\n321\n00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:25.720\nAnd they range a full gambit.\n\n322\n00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:26.950\n&gt;&gt; God.\n&gt;&gt; From,\n\n323\n00:16:26.950 --> 00:16:30.090\nwe'll give you a million dollars if you\ntell us that you have bought a firewall.\n\n324\n00:16:30.090 --> 00:16:31.290\nYou don't have to install it.\n\n325\n00:16:31.290 --> 00:16:33.240\nYou don't have to have it running.\n\n326\n00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:36.755\nIt can be sitting on a shelf in a box,\nbut you've bought one, right.\n\n327\n00:16:36.755 --> 00:16:39.480\nTwo yes we have a fully built out program.\n\n328\n00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:44.630\nWe ask our people to re-up their\ncertifications every so often.\n\n329\n00:16:44.630 --> 00:16:46.360\nAnd that's what the basis\nof our insurance is.\n\n330\n00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:48.880\nSo does 171 actually make a difference?\n\n331\n00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:52.660\n&gt;&gt; 171 can absolutely make a difference\nif you're a federal contractor\n\n332\n00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:56.780\na sub do federal contractor or sub do\na sub do a sub do federal contractor and\n\n333\n00:16:56.780 --> 00:17:02.010\nyou're and you have a contract and\nyou do not have 800-171 compliance by\n\n334\n00:17:02.010 --> 00:17:05.850\nthe end of 2017 you stand a very good\nchance of losing that contract all right.\n\n335\n00:17:05.850 --> 00:17:10.820\nI've talked to prime contractors who have\nhad their government lease on say hey.\n\n336\n00:17:10.820 --> 00:17:13.260\nYou see this clause in the contract where\nit says you have to be compliant for\n\n337\n00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:14.390\ninformation security?\n\n338\n00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:17.258\nThis time, we're holding you to that.\n\n339\n00:17:17.258 --> 00:17:20.887\nAs of December 31 2017,\nif you are not compliant with 800171,\n\n340\n00:17:20.887 --> 00:17:23.220\nyou can pretty much kiss\nthat contract goodbye.\n\n341\n00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:26.290\nNow-\n&gt;&gt; So you're saying that\n\n342\n00:17:26.290 --> 00:17:29.510\nif I own cyber insurance\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n343\n00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:34.080\n&gt;&gt; Right, if I own cyber insurance or\nI do any type of government contracting,\n\n344\n00:17:35.530 --> 00:17:40.980\nthat it's gonna care that like it\nreally I should really care about this.\n\n345\n00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:41.810\n&gt;&gt; So you should care.\n\n346\n00:17:41.810 --> 00:17:44.360\nAnd you should care even if you\nare not a government contractor.\n\n347\n00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:47.420\nLook cyber insurance, okay so\nthis three things that matter.\n\n348\n00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:48.690\nAre you a government contractor?\n\n349\n00:17:48.690 --> 00:17:50.660\nIf not, okay ignore that one.\n\n350\n00:17:50.660 --> 00:17:53.330\nDo you have customers, because if you have\ncustomers and you go hey, by the way,\n\n351\n00:17:53.330 --> 00:17:57.420\ncustomer, we have a risk management\nprogram and we are having a security\n\n352\n00:17:57.420 --> 00:18:02.258\nmaturity issue that we've fixed and we are\nmature in the information security realm.\n\n353\n00:18:02.258 --> 00:18:05.350\nThey go wow,\nI'm much happier dealing with you now,\n\n354\n00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:07.290\nbecause I know you're actually secure.\n\n355\n00:18:07.290 --> 00:18:10.220\nAnd you go hey cyber insurance vendor,\nbecause these days if you don't have\n\n356\n00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:15.510\ncyber insurance, you're in trouble anyway\nI have an information security program.\n\n357\n00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:18.400\nI have an information security system.\n\n358\n00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:19.990\nWe're up to date on everything.\n\n359\n00:18:19.990 --> 00:18:21.420\nI have a risk management framework.\n\n360\n00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:22.700\nWe're doing really good.\n\n361\n00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:23.700\nHow do you like it?\n\n362\n00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:27.350\nAnd your cyber insurance company's\ngonna go, hey, wow you're awesome.\n\n363\n00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:28.736\nYour premium could go down.\n\n364\n00:18:28.736 --> 00:18:31.788\nThey could very much be happy with you\nin terms of if you put in a claim,\n\n365\n00:18:31.788 --> 00:18:34.950\nthey're gonna go no, no, no,\nthese guys actually did good stuff.\n\n366\n00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:37.380\nIf they put in a claim,\nsomething really bad happened,\n\n367\n00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:41.420\npay the claim faster; you're gonna have\nproof that any claims that you put in\n\n368\n00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:44.420\nare legitimate faster because\nyou're going to be logging things.\n\n369\n00:18:44.420 --> 00:18:45.790\nSo, my god, you care!\n\n370\n00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:51.143\nOkay, even if you're not a government\ncontractor if you have customers or\n\n371\n00:18:51.143 --> 00:18:53.296\ncyber insurance or both, you care.\n\n372\n00:18:53.296 --> 00:18:58.097\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\nwe have outlined a whole bunch of things\n\n373\n00:18:58.097 --> 00:19:03.337\nabout 171 even though this is brief and\nshort, right.\n\n374\n00:19:03.337 --> 00:19:08.830\nYeah so where do we go from here?\n\n375\n00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:10.140\nThat's the question.\n\n376\n00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:11.450\n&gt;&gt; That's a great question.\n\n377\n00:19:11.450 --> 00:19:12.790\nSo the answer is simple.\n\n378\n00:19:12.790 --> 00:19:15.632\nIf you have questions please\ngive us a call ask us,\n\n379\n00:19:15.632 --> 00:19:18.910\nemail us,\nour emails are in the presentation.\n\n380\n00:19:18.910 --> 00:19:22.070\nI am Joshua Marpet Jmarpet@redlion.io.\n\n381\n00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:25.162\n&gt;&gt; And I am Scott Lyons Slyons@redlion.io.\n\n382\n00:19:25.162 --> 00:19:29.258\nAnd you can reach me on\ntwitter @csp3r Casper.\n\n383\n00:19:29.258 --> 00:19:29.849\n&gt;&gt; Casper.\n\n384\n00:19:29.849 --> 00:19:31.180\n&gt;&gt; Old nickname of his.\n\n385\n00:19:31.180 --> 00:19:32.830\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; Effectively,\n\n386\n00:19:32.830 --> 00:19:37.280\nwhat we wanna do is show you that it's not\nthat hard to do a compliance framework,\n\n387\n00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:41.380\nto be compliant, to do risk management,\nto increase your security maturity.\n\n388\n00:19:41.380 --> 00:19:43.401\nIt takes time, it takes effort,\nit takes some money.\n\n389\n00:19:43.401 --> 00:19:46.538\nBut, what it really takes is\na determination that I'm gonna reduce my\n\n390\n00:19:46.538 --> 00:19:49.889\nsales friction, I'm gonna increase my\nlikelihood that I can actually get\n\n391\n00:19:49.889 --> 00:19:53.504\na successful claim in cyber insurance,\nand I'm gonna make myself a better way,\n\n392\n00:19:53.504 --> 00:19:57.012\na better company to be a government\ncontractor or sub do government contractor\n\n393\n00:19:57.012 --> 00:20:00.120\nto get some of those beautiful\nlarge government contracts.\n\n394\n00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:01.335\nAnd if you do these things,\n\n395\n00:20:01.335 --> 00:20:04.030\nyour business is probably gonna succeed\na lot better then if you didn't.\n\n396\n00:20:04.030 --> 00:20:07.480\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and foremost,\nit also is a great reduction in risk.\n\n397\n00:20:08.530 --> 00:20:10.100\n&gt;&gt; Not a bad thing.\n\n398\n00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:16.286\nSo that's NIST 800-171 the basics and\n\n399\n00:20:16.286 --> 00:20:23.273\nthank you very much for\njoining us here at BIZPRO.TV\n\n",

Hi, my name is Joshua Marpet,\nI'm the COO of Red Lion.\n\n15\n00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:54.310\nIn terms of compliance, I've been doing\ncompliance for quite a few years now.\n\n16\n00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:56.910\nI've been the sort of the prep guy for\n\n17\n00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.050\nhandling compliance engagements in PCI,\nHIPA.\n\n18\n00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:04.730\nDear God, in some forensics\ncompliance work in foreign countries,\n\n19\n00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:08.395\nin healthcare compliance\nin other foreign countries.\n\n20\n00:01:08.395 --> 00:01:13.190\n$40 billion PCI audits and everything\nelse in between, been around the block.\n\n21\n00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:15.360\nI've been doing this for\nquite a while, like I said.\n\n22\n00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.660\nI run information security conferences\nsuch as Security BSides Delaware.\n\n23\n00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:19.930\nI used to be on the board of hackers for\n\n24\n00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.820\ncharity besides Las Vegas in\nthe Cloud Security Alliance.\n\n25\n00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.287\nSo again, not my first rodeo.\n\n26\n00:01:25.287 --> 00:01:27.720\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So let's get into the gap analysis.\n\n27\n00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.220\n&gt;&gt; A lot of companies,\nwhen they come in to take a look at\n\n28\n00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.730\nother companies' compliance regimes,\nstart with the gap analysis.\n\n29\n00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:39.118\nAnd to us,\nit's the most critical juncture, right?\n\n30\n00:01:39.118 --> 00:01:42.088\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Most critical juncture in any\n\n31\n00:01:42.088 --> 00:01:44.997\ncompliance engagement, right?\n\n32\n00:01:44.997 --> 00:01:48.300\nBut, the real question is,\nwhere do we start?\n\n33\n00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.738\nHow do we get there, and what do we do?\n\n34\n00:01:51.738 --> 00:01:54.170\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\nlet's start with the beginning.\n\n35\n00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.430\nWhen you go to a compliance engagement and\n\n36\n00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.920\nyou've scoped it properly,\nyou know what you're doing.\n\n37\n00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.140\nYou know where you're going, you know what\nthey want and you know what they need.\n\n38\n00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:08.120\nYour client has to be, let's say,\nPCI compliant by the end of some month.\n\n39\n00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:13.730\nThey're a 400 employee company,\nthey handle this many credit cards.\n\n40\n00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.020\nYou get the idea,\nyou've got the data in front of you.\n\n41\n00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.340\nNow you need to figure\nout where they are now.\n\n42\n00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:19.250\nYou know where they need to be.\n\n43\n00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.400\nThey need to be compliant\nwith PCI whether it's 3.2 or\n\n44\n00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.710\nwhatever it is when you watch this video.\n\n45\n00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:26.420\nBut where they are now is the problem.\n\n46\n00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.720\nWe need to find out from now\nuntil goal what is that delta?\n\n47\n00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:31.660\nWhat is that change?\n\n48\n00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.300\nWhat is that differentiation?\n\n49\n00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.640\nAnd that's the point,\nthat's what the gap analysis does.\n\n50\n00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.970\nIt tells you where the gaps or\nthe risks are.\n\n51\n00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.500\nIf you can figure out what's going on,\nyou can tell what's wrong with their\n\n52\n00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.560\nprocesses, their procedures, their\nsystems, their encryption, their whatever.\n\n53\n00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.510\nAnd if you can figure out all the things\nthat you have to do to bring them up to\n\n54\n00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.510\nspeed, the remediation plan.\n\n55\n00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.590\nThen you can move them forward through it.\n\n56\n00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.140\nAnd help them get to the point where they\nwill actually pass a compliance audit or\n\n57\n00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.970\nassessment depending on which\ncompliance regime it is.\n\n58\n00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.380\nThat's literally the whole point\nof a compliance engagement, so\n\n59\n00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:05.672\nthis talk is done, right?\n\n60\n00:03:05.672 --> 00:03:07.845\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] No, no, not at all.\n\n61\n00:03:07.845 --> 00:03:10.470\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There's way more that goes into a gap\n\n62\n00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.260\nanalysis than just saying here's where\nyou need to be and here's where you are.\n\n63\n00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.610\nYou have different types\nof project management,\n\n64\n00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:19.290\nyou have different involvements\nfrom organizations\n\n65\n00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.350\ninside of the organization that you're\ntrying to Bring up to compliance.\n\n66\n00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:25.780\nPlus you also have the compliance\nsets on top of it.\n\n67\n00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.980\nSo understanding your standards,\nyour procedures, your policies, and\n\n68\n00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.030\nyour guidelines.\n\n69\n00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.320\nAnd how that affects,\nnot only the compliance audit, but\n\n70\n00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:34.280\nalso the business as a whole.\n\n71\n00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.500\n&gt;&gt; So, really good points,\nby the way, thank you.\n\n72\n00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.840\nSo let's talk about that for a second.\n\n73\n00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.780\nIf you've got a company that you\nneed to bring up to speed for\n\n74\n00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.520\nsome particular regime,\nyou need to figure out where they are now.\n\n75\n00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:47.710\nLike we said, that's what the compliance,\nthe Gap Analysis is.\n\n76\n00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:51.140\nYou need to figure out what their\nprocesses are now, so start by saying,\n\n77\n00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:53.460\nhey what are your process and\nprocedures now?\n\n78\n00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:54.480\nWhat's your policy now?\n\n79\n00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:55.390\nWhat's your standards now?\n\n80\n00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:56.500\nCan I get copies of them?\n\n81\n00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.420\nYou have to read through them,\nthat's literally stage one.\n\n82\n00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:00.950\nThen you go in and interview people.\n\n83\n00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:02.940\nFirst off, you have to find out right now,\n\n84\n00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.430\ndo they actually follow there\nprocesses and procedures?\n\n85\n00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:10.090\nIf they don't, you're even farther behind\nthe eight ball, if you will, okay?\n\n86\n00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:13.270\nYou've gotta make sure that they know what\nthey're doing in terms of following proper\n\n87\n00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:14.940\nprocess, proper procedure.\n\n88\n00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.050\nYou've gotta make sure that not only are\nthey doing what they say they're doing,\n\n89\n00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:19.350\nbut they're actually recording it.\n\n90\n00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:21.790\nSo you've gotta check their\naudible repositories.\n\n91\n00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:23.650\nThese are the repositories of information.\n\n92\n00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:24.930\nLet me give you an example.\n\n93\n00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.020\nIf you have somebody\nthat you're on boarding,\n\n94\n00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.270\na new employee,\nyou're gonna have a checklist.\n\n95\n00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:31.500\nI need to give them\nan active directory login,\n\n96\n00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.220\nI need to give them a file\nshare on the server.\n\n97\n00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:38.240\nWe need to setup a mailbox for them,\nwe need to make sure that they filled out\n\n98\n00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:41.570\ntheir HR paperwork, all those kinds\nof things, right, that's a checklist.\n\n99\n00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:43.240\nIt is at a lot of companies.\n\n100\n00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:47.640\nA copy of that checklist showing that\nthey have also signed the IT security,\n\n101\n00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:51.780\nand HR processes and procedures,\nthe acceptable use policy.\n\n102\n00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:54.590\nAll the different policies that\nthey are going to be held to,\n\n103\n00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:57.500\nis part of that checklist, and\nthat checklist, or, at least,\n\n104\n00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:00.540\ntheir signatures, should be held, so.\n\n105\n00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:05.670\n&gt;&gt; In another talk, we actually go\ninto detail about how a lot of IT\n\n106\n00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:08.240\nis being commoditized, and automated.\n\n107\n00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:12.550\nSo, when you're looking for these types\nof things, don't forget to always look.\n\n108\n00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:17.120\nI'm sorry, look to assist admins, and\n\n109\n00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:21.460\nmake sure that they haven't already\nautomated that entire process.\n\n110\n00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:25.366\nOr other processes that\nthe company may rely on for\n\n111\n00:05:25.366 --> 00:05:28.721\ntheir product, such as nightly builds.\n\n112\n00:05:28.721 --> 00:05:32.500\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's entirely possible that the\nchecklist, we're gonna go back to this.\n\n113\n00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.715\nThe checklist HR can fill out\nthe various species of it,\n\n114\n00:05:35.715 --> 00:05:39.635\nit builds into a checklist that is\ninterrupted into a file share and stored.\n\n115\n00:05:39.635 --> 00:05:42.175\nAnd they don't even know about it\ncuz this is behind the scenes.\n\n116\n00:05:42.175 --> 00:05:45.505\nAnd if there is a nightly build,\nthat is done automatically say Jenkins or\n\n117\n00:05:45.505 --> 00:05:47.580\nsome of the other continuous\nintegration system.\n\n118\n00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:51.260\nIt may be that you don't have\na Dev Ops policy about builds\n\n119\n00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:54.540\nbecause it's done every night,\nthat's by design.\n\n120\n00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:57.770\nSo maybe you need a policy just to\npoint out, that it's done every night.\n\n121\n00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:59.230\nHere's the system that does it.\n\n122\n00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:01.470\nHere's how we do it and\nhere's why we do it that way.\n\n123\n00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:05.480\nBut it might not be written down,\nbecause it's just something that happens,\n\n124\n00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:07.770\nit's magic,\nwe don't know anything about it.\n\n125\n00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:11.140\n&gt;&gt; No, Josh,\nlet me ask you this point-blank,\n\n126\n00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:17.670\nhow many times have you been involved\nin a audit, involved in an audit?\n\n127\n00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:21.030\nWhere the people that have hired you\nhave said, no you can't talk to me and\n\n128\n00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:25.140\nyou can't talk to my people,\nbut you have to do the audit.\n\n129\n00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:26.476\n&gt;&gt; All of them.\n\n130\n00:06:26.476 --> 00:06:29.960\n&gt;&gt; Okay, now let me ask another\nquestion as a follow on to that.\n\n131\n00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:33.970\nHow many times have you been involved in\nan audit where somebody didn't know that\n\n132\n00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:35.970\nthings were automated?\n\n133\n00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:39.150\n&gt;&gt; That's actually pretty common,\nespecially in a bigger companies.\n\n134\n00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:40.880\nSo in a bigger company.\n\n135\n00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:43.160\nLet's use Microsoft as an example,\nnot Microsoft the company but\n\n136\n00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.440\nthe company using a lot\nof Microsoft products.\n\n137\n00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:48.680\nThey'll often times have SharePoint\nsystem set up with workflows built in and\n\n138\n00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:50.250\napprovals and things like that.\n\n139\n00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:52.495\nSo let's go back to, let's do a new one.\n\n140\n00:06:52.495 --> 00:06:54.944\nI'm gonna buy a computer,\nI'm gonna buy a server.\n\n141\n00:06:54.944 --> 00:06:56.550\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so I'm gonna buy a server,\n\n142\n00:06:56.550 --> 00:07:00.490\nI'm gonna say I need this server,\nI needed it to have this specifications.\n\n143\n00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:04.400\nI put it in to procurement in a SharePoint\nform, that form is automatically routed\n\n144\n00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:09.530\nfor approval to purchasing your manager\nand rolls along until it hits the end.\n\n145\n00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:12.570\nAll the approvals are done, guess what,\nit gets automatically ordered.\n\n146\n00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:15.690\nYou don't know that that system,\nthat form that you filled out has been\n\n147\n00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:18.960\nmultiply approved goes into\nan auditable repository.\n\n148\n00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:20.930\nBut somebody might know,\nsomebody might not.\n\n149\n00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:21.680\nIt might just be,\n\n150\n00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:25.660\nthere is a file share with all sorts\nof stuff in it, could that be it?\n\n151\n00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:29.530\nYeah, absolutely, so\na more mature company, a larger company,\n\n152\n00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:31.410\nwill often times have\nthese automatic systems.\n\n153\n00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:34.240\nThat a smaller one will manually handle or\nmanually do,\n\n154\n00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:35.675\nbecause they haven't had\nthe time to build it.\n\n155\n00:07:35.675 --> 00:07:39.840\nIn terms of the politics,\nin terms of the getting through to people.\n\n156\n00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:43.130\nLiterally, every single time\nwe go in to do a gap analysis,\n\n157\n00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:47.640\nliterally every single time we\ndo an analysis of anything.\n\n158\n00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:50.680\nWe get the departments like,\nwe're too busy you can't talk to us.\n\n159\n00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:52.010\nOr no we don't know about that, and\n\n160\n00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:54.960\nyou can't make us claim that\nwe know anything about it.\n\n161\n00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:57.330\nWell it's your responsibility,\nyou don't know anything about it?\n\n162\n00:07:57.330 --> 00:07:58.600\nWe don't know it's our responsibility,\n\n163\n00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:01.290\nnobody told us that so\nit's not gonna happen.\n\n164\n00:08:01.290 --> 00:08:04.610\nWell, okay, and that's when you\nneed to have that top down buy in\n\n165\n00:08:04.610 --> 00:08:09.220\nthat we referred to in the first\nvideo in this series, Compliance 1.\n\n166\n00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:12.080\nBecause it's absolutely essential\nthat you have somebody to go back to.\n\n167\n00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:14.810\nLook you're a consultant, you don't\nhave really clout in the company.\n\n168\n00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:17.330\nYou need to go back to somebody that\ndoes and they can come down and\n\n169\n00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:19.380\nhammer on these people until\nthey give you what you need.\n\n170\n00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:24.120\n&gt;&gt; Now how many times have you gone into\na company to do the Gap assessment To do\n\n171\n00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:29.730\nthe skills assessment as well and\nfound that a C level exec looks\n\n172\n00:08:29.730 --> 00:08:34.340\nat a process that should be automated and\nsays that it's not, number one.\n\n173\n00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:37.450\nNumber two,\nthe process that we have does not\n\n174\n00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:40.630\naccurately cover absolutely\neverything that needs to happened.\n\n175\n00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:43.179\nAnd therefore, that process, that's wrong.\n\n176\n00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:46.270\n&gt;&gt; That's pretty common as well.\n\n177\n00:08:46.270 --> 00:08:50.760\nIt's very common that a C level exec\nwill say, I thought that was automated.\n\n178\n00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:54.560\nNo, just cuz you don't see the people\ncarrying the papers around on sneakernet\n\n179\n00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:55.540\ndoesn't mean it's automated.\n\n180\n00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:57.466\nIt means you don't see them, okay?\n\n181\n00:08:57.466 --> 00:08:59.928\nAnd the fact that they dump\nthem on the circular file,\n\n182\n00:08:59.928 --> 00:09:01.631\nthe trash can on the way out the door.\n\n183\n00:09:01.631 --> 00:09:05.130\nWell that means they're probably\nnot in an audible repository.\n\n184\n00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:07.520\nBecause the trash can is not\nan auditable repository.\n\n185\n00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:09.790\nIt's a detail thing that\nemptied every night.\n\n186\n00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:14.130\nIt goes to a huge great landfill that\nis technically auditable repository,\n\n187\n00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:16.920\nif you have enough money to get me to\nclimb through about a mountain of garbage.\n\n188\n00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:20.135\nBut anyway, that was a joke,\nplease don't try to ask me for that.\n\n189\n00:09:20.135 --> 00:09:25.785\n&gt;&gt; Okay, all joking aside here though,\nlet's take a look at, yeah we do that.\n\n190\n00:09:25.785 --> 00:09:29.105\nNow the reason that I wanna\npull this out specifically\n\n191\n00:09:29.105 --> 00:09:33.225\nis how many client regimes\nout there want the artefacts?\n\n192\n00:09:33.225 --> 00:09:37.635\nIt's not as simple saying,\nfirewalls yeah we do that, check.\n\n193\n00:09:37.635 --> 00:09:41.400\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so you've got\ncompliance regimes on the whole.\n\n194\n00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:44.250\nNow there's a lot of compliance\nregimes out there, there FERPA for\n\n195\n00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:47.490\neducation, there's HIPAA for\nhealthcare, there's GDPR for EU.\n\n196\n00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:50.170\nThere's a list a mile long, okay.\n\n197\n00:09:50.170 --> 00:09:53.545\nBut most every compliance\nregime requires artifacts.\n\n198\n00:09:53.545 --> 00:09:55.705\nThose artifacts could be a policy.\n\n199\n00:09:55.705 --> 00:09:58.265\nHIPAA's very policy-based, so\nto prove that you're HIPAA compliant,\n\n200\n00:09:58.265 --> 00:09:59.725\nyou have to show all your policies.\n\n201\n00:10:01.005 --> 00:10:06.115\nPCI requires that you show a significant\namount of repositories and\n\n202\n00:10:06.115 --> 00:10:08.045\nit has everything about\nemployee retention.\n\n203\n00:10:08.045 --> 00:10:12.145\nIt has things about all sorts of different\nthings, 853 says you need to know\n\n204\n00:10:12.145 --> 00:10:15.920\nevery single operating, excuse me,\nOU in active directory.\n\n205\n00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:17.530\n&gt;&gt; And what is an OU?\n\n206\n00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:18.080\n&gt;&gt; OU?\n\n207\n00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:19.210\n&gt;&gt; Yeah for-\n&gt;&gt; Organizational Unit.\n\n208\n00:10:19.210 --> 00:10:21.220\n&gt;&gt; For people that may be\ninterested in compliance but\n\n209\n00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:24.830\nthey don't really understand the IT lingo,\nwhat is the OU?\n\n210\n00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:28.350\n&gt;&gt; Okay, my apologies, an OU is an\nOrganizational Unit in active directory.\n\n211\n00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:30.800\nBasically, think of it as an organizer.\n\n212\n00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:33.570\nSo if I have, you can do it by geography.\n\n213\n00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:36.510\nI have a northwestern office and\nI have a southeastern office.\n\n214\n00:10:36.510 --> 00:10:39.470\nI could have an OU for northwestern\noffice and OU for southeastern office.\n\n215\n00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:44.914\nI could have an OU for directors and\nan OU for admins and an OU for engineers.\n\n216\n00:10:44.914 --> 00:10:47.090\n&gt;&gt; So what you're saying is,\ninside of active directory,\n\n217\n00:10:47.090 --> 00:10:51.020\nit's an easy way of splitting up the tasks\nthat active directory needs to complete\n\n218\n00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:52.954\non the forest which is the business.\n\n219\n00:10:52.954 --> 00:10:55.235\n&gt;&gt; Right, and\nby the way if you need to get into this,\n\n220\n00:10:55.235 --> 00:10:59.120\nITPRO.TV has a lot of courses\non active directory, Windows and\n\n221\n00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:01.340\nall the different nuances of\nadministering that stuff.\n\n222\n00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:03.650\nPlease check at ITPRO for that.\n\n223\n00:11:03.650 --> 00:11:07.430\nIrrespectively, we've got\nthe original question that was asked,\n\n224\n00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:11.320\nwhich was how many times have I been told,\nwe do that, you don't need to check that.\n\n225\n00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:13.480\nAnd the answer is a lot.\n\n226\n00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:18.700\nYou don't have to be a pain in the buns\nto got through that objection.\n\n227\n00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:21.180\nBut you need to make\nsure to your satisfaction\n\n228\n00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:22.840\nthat something is actually being done.\n\n229\n00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:24.730\nThis is not merely a check box audit,\n\n230\n00:11:24.730 --> 00:11:28.060\nthis is a audit of actually\nis it being done properly.\n\n231\n00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:28.900\nBecause remember,\n\n232\n00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:33.590\nwhen the auditor comes through, you have\nbetter done a better job than the auditor.\n\n233\n00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:36.400\nYou had better had gone\na level deeper in detail.\n\n234\n00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:41.380\nBecause when they come through,\nthey should just go wow, this is amazing.\n\n235\n00:11:41.380 --> 00:11:43.430\n&gt;&gt; So, let's say you've built a car.\n\n236\n00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:46.390\nIf you've been watching\nthe [INAUDIBLE] presentations,\n\n237\n00:11:46.390 --> 00:11:49.610\nyou've seen us talk about idea to product,\nokay.\n\n238\n00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:54.590\nLet's say you've built a car, and the last\nthing you need to do, is have the torque\n\n239\n00:11:54.590 --> 00:12:00.270\nspecifications on every single nut and\nbolt that is on the vehicle checked.\n\n240\n00:12:00.270 --> 00:12:02.300\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so when is it easier to do that?\n\n241\n00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:06.025\nIs it easier to do that when the car is in\nfront of you, all complete in its glory?\n\n242\n00:12:06.025 --> 00:12:06.550\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Or\n\n243\n00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:09.790\nis it easier to do that on the assembly\nline as you're going through, and\n\n244\n00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:13.100\nhaving the check stations that check\nthe torque on every nut and bolt?\n\n245\n00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:14.420\n&gt;&gt; Well, it's funny that you'd say that,\n\n246\n00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:19.890\nbecause, a lot of times,\nit has to fit the business, okay?\n\n247\n00:12:19.890 --> 00:12:21.770\n&gt;&gt; But it should always fit the business.\n\n248\n00:12:21.770 --> 00:12:24.420\nCompliance is not something\nthat is not business friendly.\n\n249\n00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:28.470\nCompliance is a way of saying,\nyou told me you we're going to do this.\n\n250\n00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:31.960\nI am going to hold you to those\nthings you said you would do.\n\n251\n00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:34.680\nIt's not that it's\nantithetical to business or\n\n252\n00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:37.750\nantithetical to making money who would,\nsorry.\n\n253\n00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:40.390\nIt's not that it is\nan enemy of making money or\n\n254\n00:12:40.390 --> 00:12:44.430\nan enemy of performing business,\nit is part and parcel of it.\n\n255\n00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:50.320\nIf you're compliant you absolutely help\nyour sales fraction you help it disappear.\n\n256\n00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:54.640\nYou help sales move along smoothly because\npeople go you're compliant and secure?\n\n257\n00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:58.430\nI like that i will buy from you over your\ncompetitor who is neither compliant nor\n\n258\n00:12:58.430 --> 00:12:59.480\nsecure.\n\n259\n00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:03.460\nYou have business that goes on and\nyou can use this to your advantage.\n\n260\n00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:05.980\nIt's a marketing ploy, it's a sales ploy.\n\n261\n00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:08.610\nIt is all kinds of things\nthat you can do and\n\n262\n00:13:08.610 --> 00:13:12.120\nit makes your customers comfortable\nwith you doing the business.\n\n263\n00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:13.920\nSo, why would it be a problem?\n\n264\n00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:18.940\n&gt;&gt;

Okay, I think it's a fit.\n\n267\n00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:29.490\n&gt;&gt; All right, well obviously we\nhave questions about this, but\n\n268\n00:13:29.490 --> 00:13:32.820\nif you have questions feel\nfree to reach out to us.\n\n269\n00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:36.567\nYou can find me on Twitter,\nScott Lyons, @csp3r, C-S-P-3-R.\n\n270\n00:13:36.567 --> 00:13:42.940\nYou can also find me at Slyons@redlion.io\n&gt;&gt;

Hello, so hi guys.\n\n8\n00:00:23.862 --> 00:00:27.682\nMy name is Scott Lyons,\nI am the CEO of Red Line.\n\n9\n00:00:27.682 --> 00:00:31.967\nI've been all over this industry from\ngovernment to commercial to private\n\n10\n00:00:31.967 --> 00:00:32.859\ncooperation.\n\n11\n00:00:32.859 --> 00:00:37.731\nI've done a lot, man,\nI'm a certification holder,\n\n12\n00:00:37.731 --> 00:00:41.805\nI won't say which,\nin information security.\n\n13\n00:00:41.805 --> 00:00:44.549\nMy passions are people and\nbusiness so, Josh?\n\n14\n00:00:44.549 --> 00:00:49.630\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Joshua Marpet, I'm the COO,\nChief Operating Officer of Red Lion.\n\n15\n00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:52.058\nIn terms of compliance,\nI've been around for quite a while.\n\n16\n00:00:52.058 --> 00:00:55.481\nI've done everything from PCI,\nHIPAA, International Compliance,\n\n17\n00:00:55.481 --> 00:00:57.372\nbeen pretty much everywhere doing it.\n\n18\n00:00:57.372 --> 00:00:58.693\nIt's a lot of fun and interesting, and\n\n19\n00:00:58.693 --> 00:01:00.505\nwe're trying to get that\ninformation across to you.\n\n20\n00:01:00.505 --> 00:01:02.258\nSo let's get right into it.\n\n21\n00:01:02.258 --> 00:01:06.354\n&gt;&gt; So today, we're talking about\nthe remediation plan, okay?\n\n22\n00:01:06.354 --> 00:01:09.890\nAnd specifically what goes into it.\n\n23\n00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.710\nSo Josh, how many times have you been\non an audit where you've seen the road\n\n24\n00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:16.018\nmap come together?\n\n25\n00:01:16.018 --> 00:01:19.828\nAnd the people who you're auditing\nsay well we really don't understand\n\n26\n00:01:19.828 --> 00:01:21.736\nthe road map, give us a plan.\n\n27\n00:01:21.736 --> 00:01:23.364\n&gt;&gt; That's very normal.\n\n28\n00:01:23.364 --> 00:01:25.798\nI mean remember as well\nyou've got multiple roadmaps.\n\n29\n00:01:25.798 --> 00:01:27.819\nYou've got the corporate\nstrategic roadmap.\n\n30\n00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:30.668\nYou've got the compliance\nroadmap if they have one.\n\n31\n00:01:30.668 --> 00:01:32.900\nYou've got the security roadmap,\nthe IT roadmap.\n\n32\n00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.690\nIn other words, what are they doing\nover the last month, quarter, half year,\n\n33\n00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:37.326\nyear, etc.\n\n34\n00:01:37.326 --> 00:01:42.256\nYou've got the remediation plan that you\nneed to actually get them from where they\n\n35\n00:01:42.256 --> 00:01:44.051\nwere to where they need to be.\n\n36\n00:01:44.051 --> 00:01:47.415\nThat's the gap analysis that we talked\nabout in the last one, in Compliance 2.\n\n37\n00:01:47.415 --> 00:01:50.172\nAnd these plans all have different pieces.\n\n38\n00:01:50.172 --> 00:01:54.071\nFor example, on the IT strategic plan it\nmight be, which things are we buying over\n\n39\n00:01:54.071 --> 00:01:57.704\nthe next year for all of our server needs,\nor our cloud needs, or whatever?\n\n40\n00:01:57.704 --> 00:02:01.830\nIn the remediation plan, it can be do I\nneed to move policy or change policy,\n\n41\n00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:03.317\nstandards, procedures?\n\n42\n00:02:03.317 --> 00:02:06.180\nWhat do I need to do to get up to speed?\n\n43\n00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.800\nAnd remember that your remediation\nplan can actually change some of these\n\n44\n00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:10.880\nother plans.\n\n45\n00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.780\nIf you say look, the servers you've been\nbuying aren't compliant, you need to\n\n46\n00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.250\nswitch to these servers over here,\nthat's gonna change the IT strategic plan.\n\n47\n00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.645\nSo a remediation plan is very\nimportant and sometimes multi-layered.\n\n48\n00:02:20.645 --> 00:02:24.642\n&gt;&gt; Right, and sometimes it can also\ninclude who's authorized to make\n\n49\n00:02:24.642 --> 00:02:26.965\nchanges to your environment, right?\n\n50\n00:02:26.965 --> 00:02:31.116\nWhat the process is for\nchecking with business units to\n\n51\n00:02:31.116 --> 00:02:35.821\nensure that the change that you\nmake actually works, right?\n\n52\n00:02:35.821 --> 00:02:40.161\nHow many times that we've been on audit\nwhere we see legacy systems that people\n\n53\n00:02:40.161 --> 00:02:41.088\nwanted change?\n\n54\n00:02:41.088 --> 00:02:45.298\nBut there was really no way to\nbring them out because it'll cost\n\n55\n00:02:45.298 --> 00:02:47.133\nthe company a lot of money.\n\n56\n00:02:47.133 --> 00:02:52.181\n&gt;&gt; Legacy systems are significant costs\nproblem and a compliance problem.\n\n57\n00:02:52.181 --> 00:02:56.419\nIf you can't update or patch a legacy\nsystem anymore, if you can't change\n\n58\n00:02:56.419 --> 00:03:00.464\nthe hardware that a legacy software,\npiece of software is running on.\n\n59\n00:03:00.464 --> 00:03:02.487\nAnd maybe you can segment it out,\n\n60\n00:03:02.487 --> 00:03:06.760\nmaybe you can move it out of scope\nof the compliance engagement.\n\n61\n00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.934\nBut otherwise they're gonna\nhave to rebuild something that\n\n62\n00:03:08.934 --> 00:03:09.879\nhas that functionality.\n\n63\n00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:11.763\nSometimes that functionality is so\n\n64\n00:03:11.763 --> 00:03:15.971\nimplicit to the company that it's hundreds\nof thousands or millions of dollars\n\n65\n00:03:15.971 --> 00:03:19.817\nto replace, even more sometimes and\nthere just isn't a budget to do it.\n\n66\n00:03:19.817 --> 00:03:24.149\n&gt;&gt; Right, now let's dig into\nthe remediation plan just a little bit\n\n67\n00:03:24.149 --> 00:03:25.973\ndeeper for a quick second.\n\n68\n00:03:25.973 --> 00:03:31.744\nHow many times have we been on engagement\nwhere we've seen the timeline for\n\n69\n00:03:31.744 --> 00:03:37.790\nthe plan itself actually change,\nbecause the changes require either money,\n\n70\n00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:40.462\nbudget or personnel all the time.\n\n71\n00:03:40.462 --> 00:03:43.221\n&gt;&gt; it's really simple,\na remediation plan includes so\n\n72\n00:03:43.221 --> 00:03:45.931\nmany different pieces\ndepending on what they need.\n\n73\n00:03:45.931 --> 00:03:50.091\nEven if their policies are up to speed,\neven if their standards are perfect.\n\n74\n00:03:50.091 --> 00:03:53.246\nAnd their procedures which how they\nperform to the standard are great.\n\n75\n00:03:53.246 --> 00:03:55.798\nYou've still gotta figure\nout are their systems and\n\n76\n00:03:55.798 --> 00:04:00.240\nthe way that they handle their systems\nproper and correct and appropriate.\n\n77\n00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:01.850\nIs their software up to date?\n\n78\n00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:05.042\nAre they using the right tools or\nthe tools they're using non-loggable,\n\n79\n00:04:05.042 --> 00:04:07.233\nthey can't be audited in any way she or\nhe perform?\n\n80\n00:04:07.233 --> 00:04:13.280\nBut these are a lot of different factors,\nso let's start with policy, okay?\n\n81\n00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.412\nWe've had to write many,\nmany policies for many companies.\n\n82\n00:04:15.412 --> 00:04:18.910\nWe've had to modify policies,\nwe've had to replace them.\n\n83\n00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:20.779\nWe've had to bring in\npolicies from outside and\n\n84\n00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:22.658\nremember, policies don't just get written.\n\n85\n00:04:22.658 --> 00:04:25.593\nThey have to get passed by the business\nunits to make sure that they actually can\n\n86\n00:04:25.593 --> 00:04:26.266\ndo what they say.\n\n87\n00:04:26.266 --> 00:04:30.510\nAnd then they have to get passed by\nour favorite people in the world, and\n\n88\n00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:32.360\nthose are lawyers.\n\n89\n00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.074\nCuz every policy imposes a legal\nobligation on the company.\n\n90\n00:04:35.074 --> 00:04:39.244\nAnd we've had policies come in\nthat we've looked at and said,\n\n91\n00:04:39.244 --> 00:04:42.235\nyou actually can't\nhandle this legality and\n\n92\n00:04:42.235 --> 00:04:47.134\nthe liability that this policy imposes\non you, it's just not possible.\n\n93\n00:04:47.134 --> 00:04:52.779\nYou're holding liability that your\nnot paying to hedge the risk.\n\n94\n00:04:52.779 --> 00:04:55.970\nYou don't have any cyber insurance on\nthis amazing amount of information\n\n95\n00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:57.580\nyou're holding.\n\n96\n00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.230\nLet me give you an example.\n\n97\n00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:02.140\nWe went with a company and\nwent to help them out.\n\n98\n00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:05.820\nThey were holding millions of pieces\nof personally identifiable information.\n\n99\n00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:07.426\nThey were not paid to hold them,\n\n100\n00:05:07.426 --> 00:05:11.180\nthey were simply storing them\nbecause they'd been handed them.\n\n101\n00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:13.460\nI said, okay,\ndo you have cyber insurance on them,\n\n102\n00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:16.130\nare you hedging your risk in any way,\nshape or form?\n\n103\n00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:17.770\nWait, we need to?\n\n104\n00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:19.400\nYes, you think you need to?\n\n105\n00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:19.908\nIt's kind of important.\n\n106\n00:05:19.908 --> 00:05:24.250\nSo it's very important that you\nunderstand that your policies and\n\n107\n00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:26.430\nyour liability are hand in hand.\n\n108\n00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:30.428\nIf you're not hedging your risk,\nif your not being paid for that liability,\n\n109\n00:05:30.428 --> 00:05:32.150\nwhy are you holding it?\n\n110\n00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:34.165\nSometimes examining your policies\nis the best way to figure that out.\n\n111\n00:05:34.165 --> 00:05:34.891\n&gt;&gt; Right, and\n\n112\n00:05:34.891 --> 00:05:39.837\nother times it's looking at the standards\nthat the policy are based on, right?\n\n113\n00:05:39.837 --> 00:05:42.014\nSo who's responsible for what?\n\n114\n00:05:42.014 --> 00:05:48.384\nAnd how to explain what's going\non with meeting goals, right?\n\n115\n00:05:48.384 --> 00:05:53.476\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so a standard is effectively,\nlet's do it this way.\n\n116\n00:05:53.476 --> 00:05:56.960\nA policy is gonna tell you\nthat we have anti-virus.\n\n117\n00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:01.784\nA standard says,\nwe use proper antivirus systems to meet\n\n118\n00:06:01.784 --> 00:06:06.012\nthe goal of having an anti-virus policy,\nokay?\n\n119\n00:06:06.012 --> 00:06:08.851\nAnd then a procedure is we use McAfee,\n\n120\n00:06:08.851 --> 00:06:13.620\nwe use whatever to handle our\nstandard of having anti-virus.\n\n121\n00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:17.160\nAnd so it's a hierarchical system,\nyour policy explains your goals,\n\n122\n00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:19.639\nyour standard explains\nhow you meet those goals.\n\n123\n00:06:19.639 --> 00:06:24.600\nAnd the procedure explains the specifics\nof how you meet those goals.\n\n124\n00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:27.406\nAnd it works very, very well,\nthis is something recent,\n\n125\n00:06:27.406 --> 00:06:30.287\nwe've replaced our standard\nsystem of doing it with this.\n\n126\n00:06:30.287 --> 00:06:33.059\nWe got introduced to this by\nthe company that we've met.\n\n127\n00:06:33.059 --> 00:06:34.486\nIt works very well, I like it a lot, so\n\n128\n00:06:34.486 --> 00:06:36.416\nwe actually changed our\ndocumentation to meet it.\n\n129\n00:06:36.416 --> 00:06:40.215\nBut in terms of the policy standards and\nprocedures hierarchy,\n\n130\n00:06:40.215 --> 00:06:44.856\nyou have to examine all of those as a\ncompliance expert to determine if they're\n\n131\n00:06:44.856 --> 00:06:48.990\nmeeting the proper standards for\nthe compliance regime.\n\n132\n00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:51.860\nIf you miss out on looking\nat their procedures,\n\n133\n00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:55.720\nyou're not checking whether the proper\nprocedures are being followed.\n\n134\n00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:58.869\nBecause not only do you have to make sure\nthat the procedure is good and proper and\n\n135\n00:06:58.869 --> 00:07:00.286\nit meets the compliance standard.\n\n136\n00:07:00.286 --> 00:07:02.478\nBut you also have to check\nthe other side of the equation,\n\n137\n00:07:02.478 --> 00:07:04.250\nare they actually doing it?\n\n138\n00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:05.491\nAre they actually\nfollowing that procedure?\n\n139\n00:07:05.491 --> 00:07:08.730\nAre they actually performing what\nthey said what they were gonna do?\n\n140\n00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:10.441\nRemember, compliance is that.\n\n141\n00:07:10.441 --> 00:07:14.497\nIt's all about, you said you were\ngonna do x, are you doing x?\n\n142\n00:07:14.497 --> 00:07:18.575\nIf you're not, you're not meeting your own\nstandard that we asked you to help write.\n\n143\n00:07:18.575 --> 00:07:20.033\nIt's just that simple.\n\n144\n00:07:20.033 --> 00:07:24.342\n&gt;&gt; Now one of the things that we\nreally should highlight in here and\n\n145\n00:07:24.342 --> 00:07:30.175\ngo into a little bit of depth on is what's\nknown as CCB, the change control board.\n\n146\n00:07:30.175 --> 00:07:30.789\n&gt;&gt; Dear.\n\n147\n00:07:30.789 --> 00:07:33.758\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so we're gonna take a second and\ndive into that.\n\n148\n00:07:33.758 --> 00:07:36.368\nBecause it's appropriate right here,\n\n149\n00:07:36.368 --> 00:07:39.597\nright now to talk about\nthe change control board.\n\n150\n00:07:39.597 --> 00:07:43.902\nI know I'm a victim of this, how many\ntimes have you stepped into a business,\n\n151\n00:07:43.902 --> 00:07:48.474\nand they didn't have any type of either a,\nchange control procedures, policy,\n\n152\n00:07:48.474 --> 00:07:50.014\nstandards or guidelines?\n\n153\n00:07:50.014 --> 00:07:55.918\nOr b, a stakeholder based\ncontrol board that understood\n\n154\n00:07:55.918 --> 00:08:01.088\nexactly what was going on or\neven c, put it to use?\n\n155\n00:08:01.088 --> 00:08:02.628\nOkay, so this is a great one, I love this.\n\n156\n00:08:02.628 --> 00:08:03.858\nThis is one of my favorites.\n\n157\n00:08:03.858 --> 00:08:07.671\nA change control board, a change control\ngroup, I don't care what you call it,\n\n158\n00:08:07.671 --> 00:08:08.690\nit doesn't matter.\n\n159\n00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:11.820\nChange management system,\nagain, it doesn't matter.\n\n160\n00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:16.020\nBut if you have one, it should be\nthe centerpiece of your compliance and\n\n161\n00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:19.860\na pretty big part of the centerpiece\nof your entire IT systems.\n\n162\n00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:20.740\nWhat do you mean, Josh?\n\n163\n00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:22.030\nWell, I'm glad you asked.\n\n164\n00:08:22.030 --> 00:08:23.320\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, what do you mean, Josh?\n\n165\n00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:25.148\nI'm glad you asked.\n\n166\n00:08:25.148 --> 00:08:28.950\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Stop.\n\n167\n00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:32.324\n&gt;&gt; Change control boards,\nso why are they important?\n\n168\n00:08:32.324 --> 00:08:35.005\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\nchange control boards are very simple.\n\n169\n00:08:35.005 --> 00:08:37.090\nThey're important, I don't what\nyou call them, change management,\n\n170\n00:08:37.090 --> 00:08:38.460\nchange control, whatever.\n\n171\n00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:41.900\nBut they're the centerpiece of IT,\nthey're the centerpiece of compliance.\n\n172\n00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:43.670\nIt's really really straightforward.\n\n173\n00:08:43.670 --> 00:08:48.260\nIf you're monitoring your changes, then\nyou're making sure that there are tickets\n\n174\n00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:51.340\nthat say we need to make a change or\nwe have made a change.\n\n175\n00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:53.720\nThey should be attached to\nyour change control tickets or\n\n176\n00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:55.260\nyour change control documents.\n\n177\n00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:58.350\nThey make an auditable repository\nof what have I done to the systems,\n\n178\n00:08:58.350 --> 00:09:00.230\nwhat has been done to the systems, rather.\n\n179\n00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:03.270\nWhat code has been promoted,\nwhat hot fixes have been implemented,\n\n180\n00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:04.920\nwhat patches have been performed.\n\n181\n00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:07.970\nIf you have this,\nyou literally have a timeline of\n\n182\n00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:11.790\nall the things that have happened to\nyour systems from day one to day now.\n\n183\n00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:17.780\nAnd it's a very simple thing to say,\nwe have a problem with this one system.\n\n184\n00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:19.880\nWell, it started three days ago,\nwhat happened three days ago?\n\n185\n00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:23.100\nLook, we rolled out a new\npatch to that system or\n\n186\n00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:26.530\na sister system that it's connected to\nin some way, a database or whatever.\n\n187\n00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:31.260\nIf you have these things, you not only\nhave the basis for your change control for\n\n188\n00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:35.115\nyour compliance, you have the basis for\nan appropriate troubleshooting system.\n\n189\n00:09:35.115 --> 00:09:37.055\nYour help desk will thank you,\nI promise you.\n\n190\n00:09:37.055 --> 00:09:40.943\nIf you have that, you can work with\nyour partners because you know when you\n\n191\n00:09:40.943 --> 00:09:44.953\nmake a change and one of your value chain,\nyour suppliers or your customer,\n\n192\n00:09:44.953 --> 00:09:47.290\nsays my God, my God, I can't reach x.\n\n193\n00:09:47.290 --> 00:09:49.055\nYou know through your\nchange control board,\n\n194\n00:09:49.055 --> 00:09:52.450\nthrough your change management system,\nwhy that happened.\n\n195\n00:09:52.450 --> 00:09:55.260\nYou can track it down,\nyou can localize the issue,\n\n196\n00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.840\nyou can troubleshoot the issue,\nyou can fix the issue.\n\n197\n00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:02.640\nIf you have change management,\nyou have something that ties together\n\n198\n00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:07.280\nyour backlog of tickets in Sagera or\nwhatever, your development center.\n\n199\n00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:09.490\nYou have your DevOps tickets tied to that.\n\n200\n00:10:09.490 --> 00:10:12.220\nYou have all of your help\ndesk tickets tied to that.\n\n201\n00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:15.890\nYou have all of these things\nthat work together to make\n\n202\n00:10:15.890 --> 00:10:20.280\na smoothly functioning\ncommonality of systems.\n\n203\n00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:25.047\nThat lets you understand what's\ngoing on in your IT, IT security and\n\n204\n00:10:25.047 --> 00:10:27.854\ncompliance realms all at the same time.\n\n205\n00:10:27.854 --> 00:10:28.426\n&gt;&gt;

Well, it's not exactly the fun part,\nlet's be honest here.\n\n257\n00:13:10.872 --> 00:13:14.150\nYou're gonna say,\nwe can do these changes in three months.\n\n258\n00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:16.770\nAnd then you're gonna start talking to\nthe business units cuz that's a sensible\n\n259\n00:13:16.770 --> 00:13:18.130\ntimeline, okay, it's not a big deal.\n\n260\n00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:19.770\nAnd you're gonna talk\nto the business units.\n\n261\n00:13:19.770 --> 00:13:23.300\nAnd you're gonna get that one business\nunit that's gonna say, no, no,\n\n262\n00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:24.790\nno, six months minimum.\n\n263\n00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:26.760\nI can't touch anything for six months.\n\n264\n00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:27.540\nWe've got a code freeze.\n\n265\n00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:29.240\nYou're like, for six months?\n\n266\n00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:30.220\nOf course, don't you?\n\n267\n00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:32.510\nNo, but all right if that's your thing.\n\n268\n00:13:32.510 --> 00:13:35.760\nAnd that's your timeline and\nit just went bye bye, okay?\n\n269\n00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:37.390\nAnd then you've gotta\nactually make the changes.\n\n270\n00:13:37.390 --> 00:13:41.550\nAnd that's why we bring vitamin I,\nIbuprofen, because dear God.\n\n271\n00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:45.320\nYou better be there when the changes are\nmade, and it's going to be interesting.\n\n272\n00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:48.799\nAnd I specify interesting with\na capital I, very seriously, all right?\n\n273\n00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:53.940\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so in the government world,\nhow this would translate over is into what\n\n274\n00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:58.920\nare known as POAMS, POA&amp;M, which are-\n&gt;&gt; Plans of action and managements.\n\n275\n00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:02.490\n&gt;&gt; Well, actions and management or\nactions and milestones.\n\n276\n00:14:02.490 --> 00:14:03.223\n&gt;&gt; Sorry, my bad, you're right.\n\n277\n00:14:03.223 --> 00:14:07.274\n&gt;&gt; Because when you're going down\nthe timeline you wanna be sure that\n\n278\n00:14:07.274 --> 00:14:10.677\nyou're using basic project\nmanagement principles for\n\n279\n00:14:10.677 --> 00:14:13.840\nthe negotiation of the fixes\nto be implemented.\n\n280\n00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:16.610\n&gt;&gt; Right, when you're talking to business\nunits, you should get them together.\n\n281\n00:14:16.610 --> 00:14:18.530\nRepresentatives, the units, whatever.\n\n282\n00:14:18.530 --> 00:14:20.900\nGet them together and say, look these\nare the changes we need to make,\n\n283\n00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:23.050\nthis is the remediation\nplan we've come up with.\n\n284\n00:14:23.050 --> 00:14:24.640\nYou go, okay, when can we do this?\n\n285\n00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:25.950\nAnd that's how you build your timelines.\n\n286\n00:14:25.950 --> 00:14:27.370\nLet's go back to the timeline for\na minute.\n\n287\n00:14:27.370 --> 00:14:28.500\nThat's how you build your timeline.\n\n288\n00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:30.298\nYou had that one guy that said,\nsix months.\n\n289\n00:14:30.298 --> 00:14:32.424\nYou had everybody else that said,\nthree months is no big deal.\n\n290\n00:14:32.424 --> 00:14:34.908\nSo you make all the other changes,\nthen you wait three months and\n\n291\n00:14:34.908 --> 00:14:35.833\ndo the six-month guy.\n\n292\n00:14:35.833 --> 00:14:38.040\nAnd that's fine, okay?\n\n293\n00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:39.530\nAnd those are the milestones.\n\n294\n00:14:39.530 --> 00:14:41.770\nWe've got a milestone with business\nunit one at a month and a half,\n\n295\n00:14:41.770 --> 00:14:43.458\na milestone with business\nunit two at two months.\n\n296\n00:14:43.458 --> 00:14:45.491\nAnd a milestone with business\nunit three at three months.\n\n297\n00:14:45.491 --> 00:14:47.970\nAnd him, he's a six month milestone,\nbut it's fine.\n\n298\n00:14:47.970 --> 00:14:51.170\n&gt;&gt; But Josh, I think we're getting ahead\nof ourselves here because there's one part\n\n299\n00:14:51.170 --> 00:14:53.460\nthat we are completely overlooking.\n\n300\n00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:58.220\nThat is one of the most integral parts\nof any business, and that is QA.\n\n301\n00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:00.470\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nthat's after you've hit those milestones.\n\n302\n00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:03.380\nOnce you've hit milestone one,\nthen it's time to QA those changes.\n\n303\n00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:04.320\n&gt;&gt; And what does QA mean?\n\n304\n00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:05.200\n&gt;&gt; Quality Assurance.\n\n305\n00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:06.140\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n\n306\n00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:08.780\nSo quality assurance is\ntesting the changes.\n\n307\n00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:10.180\nIf you need to make a server change,\n\n308\n00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:13.080\nyou need to actually make sure that\nthe change performs appropriately.\n\n309\n00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:14.620\nThat the system still works,\n\n310\n00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:18.970\nthat it can perform every single action\nthat it did before if that's your plan.\n\n311\n00:15:18.970 --> 00:15:23.140\nAnd even more potentially, if that's also\nyour plan, if that was part of the change.\n\n312\n00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:27.710\nAnd that it acts as expected and\nas desired after the change.\n\n313\n00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:29.790\nIf it doesn't, that's when you roll back.\n\n314\n00:15:29.790 --> 00:15:32.215\n&gt;&gt; Now let's dig into QA for\na minute here, okay.\n\n315\n00:15:32.215 --> 00:15:36.547\nLet's really talk in depthly about\nQA because it's a deep part of\n\n316\n00:15:36.547 --> 00:15:38.570\nthe negotiation.\n\n317\n00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:43.360\nWhen you're dealing with QA,\nshould everything be tested?\n\n318\n00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:50.240\nOr should major patch releases or upgrades\nto the system or reconfigurations or\n\n319\n00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:55.100\nany modification within the system,\nshould all of that be QA?\n\n320\n00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:57.216\nWhat is in the scope of a good QA?\n\n321\n00:15:57.216 --> 00:15:58.688\n&gt;&gt; So okay, that's a really good question.\n\n322\n00:15:58.688 --> 00:16:02.671\nNow in this sort of segment, where we're\ntalking about remediation plans We're\n\n323\n00:16:02.671 --> 00:16:06.147\ntalking about making changes in two ways,\nif we're talking about QA.\n\n324\n00:16:06.147 --> 00:16:09.255\nWe're talking about making\nchanges to the policies and\n\n325\n00:16:09.255 --> 00:16:12.880\nprocedures that they're using\nto perform QA with, okay?\n\n326\n00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:15.400\nAnd we're talking about any changes\nwe might need to make as part of\n\n327\n00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:18.680\nthe remediation,\nthat we might need to QA those changes.\n\n328\n00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:20.510\nSo, let's talk about the second one first.\n\n329\n00:16:20.510 --> 00:16:22.388\nIf we need to make a change\ndue to remediation,\n\n330\n00:16:22.388 --> 00:16:25.536\nremediating the problem that they're\nnot compliant to get them compliant.\n\n331\n00:16:25.536 --> 00:16:29.609\nAnd we need to make a change, we need\nto QA every single little piece of it,\n\n332\n00:16:29.609 --> 00:16:30.450\nperiod.\n\n333\n00:16:30.450 --> 00:16:34.342\nBecause this is almost an unplanned change\nthat is not in their standard sort of\n\n334\n00:16:34.342 --> 00:16:35.160\nroad map.\n\n335\n00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:37.410\nThey have not been thinking about it,\nthey have not been working through it.\n\n336\n00:16:37.410 --> 00:16:40.300\nWe need to check every\nsingle change that we make.\n\n337\n00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:43.820\nIf we have to change a system,\nit's probably pretty unusual.\n\n338\n00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:45.940\nIt means they're very\nseriously out of compliance.\n\n339\n00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:48.470\nAnd we've got to check every little\nbit of it to make sure that a,\n\n340\n00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:52.020\nthey're in compliance,\nit's a very big help with QA.\n\n341\n00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:54.820\nAnd also that they're still\noperating as expected.\n\n342\n00:16:54.820 --> 00:16:57.040\nNow, when we're changing their policies,\n\n343\n00:16:57.040 --> 00:17:00.050\nit's very often that\nwe change a QA policy.\n\n344\n00:17:00.050 --> 00:17:02.750\nA lot of companies will operate\neven without QA teams or\n\n345\n00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:06.040\nthey'll operate with a QA team that\nonly tests every major release.\n\n346\n00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:09.740\nAnd that's it, or they'll run three\nreleases behind of vendor releases.\n\n347\n00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:13.050\nSo for security,\nif you have to change those things,\n\n348\n00:17:13.050 --> 00:17:16.320\nyou have to work with your QA team to\ndetermine what they're capable of doing.\n\n349\n00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:17.950\nIf it's a small QA team and you're saying,\n\n350\n00:17:17.950 --> 00:17:21.150\nyou have to test every release of\neverything, anything that they changed.\n\n351\n00:17:21.150 --> 00:17:24.770\nThey change a single line of code or a\nsingle figure inside of a database table,\n\n352\n00:17:24.770 --> 00:17:26.260\nyou gotta check everything.\n\n353\n00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:28.540\nIt's kinda ridiculous, okay?\n\n354\n00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:31.410\nIf they have a large QA team,\nmaybe that's fine.\n\n355\n00:17:31.410 --> 00:17:34.820\nMaybe it's a mission critical application\ndoing billions of dollars of business,\n\n356\n00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:36.020\nthen you check everything every time.\n\n357\n00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:38.560\nBut it's a balance.\n\n358\n00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:40.310\nWhat does the compliance regime say?\n\n359\n00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:44.050\nDoes it say that you need to check and\ntest every major patch release?\n\n360\n00:17:44.050 --> 00:17:45.260\nGreat, do that.\n\n361\n00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:48.560\nDoes it say that you need to\ntest only major releases?\n\n362\n00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:49.920\nOkay, do that.\n\n363\n00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:51.190\nIt all depends.\n\n364\n00:17:51.190 --> 00:17:52.064\nAgain, measure and\n\n365\n00:17:52.064 --> 00:17:55.109\nbalance the compliance regime against\nthe capability of the QA team.\n\n366\n00:17:55.109 --> 00:17:59.570\nAgainst the budget that they actually have\nand the needs that they actually have.\n\n367\n00:17:59.570 --> 00:18:00.430\nMake sense?\n\n368\n00:18:00.430 --> 00:18:02.494\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah it does.\n\n369\n00:18:02.494 --> 00:18:04.730\nA short tangent here.\n\n370\n00:18:04.730 --> 00:18:08.810\nI used to work for a company in Maryland\n\n371\n00:18:08.810 --> 00:18:12.980\nwhere the Director of Engineering\nthought literally that he was Batman.\n\n372\n00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:13.750\n&gt;&gt; I'm sorry?\n\n373\n00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:15.089\n&gt;&gt; He literally thought\nthat he was Batman.\n\n374\n00:18:15.089 --> 00:18:16.370\n&gt;&gt; You're joking.\n&gt;&gt; No, I'm not.\n\n375\n00:18:16.370 --> 00:18:21.210\nAnd he thought so carnally,\nthat he could do absolutely everything.\n\n376\n00:18:21.210 --> 00:18:25.070\nFrom server engineering to security\nengineering to system engineer,\n\n377\n00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:28.200\nI am not kidding you on this,\nto system engineering.\n\n378\n00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:32.750\nBut the funny part was when\nthe CCB time came around,\n\n379\n00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:37.491\nthe Change Control Board,\nIf something went wrong it was never\n\n380\n00:18:37.491 --> 00:18:41.060\nthe Director of\nthe Change Control Board's fault.\n\n381\n00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:43.700\n&gt;&gt; Was the Director of the Change\nControl Board also your Director?\n\n382\n00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:44.646\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n383\n00:18:44.646 --> 00:18:45.607\n&gt;&gt; That doesn't help anything, no.\n\n384\n00:18:45.607 --> 00:18:47.000\n&gt;&gt; No, no it doesn't.\n\n385\n00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.570\nAnd so when your dealing with\nthe Change Control Board, and\n\n386\n00:18:49.570 --> 00:18:54.940\nyour trying to work through mediation\nplans, it's always very integral\n\n387\n00:18:54.940 --> 00:19:00.410\nto get top level buy in on every\nsingle change, and have it signed off.\n\n388\n00:19:00.410 --> 00:19:02.800\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nwe've hammered on top level buy in,\n\n389\n00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:05.555\nand top down buy in pretty significantly.\n\n390\n00:19:05.555 --> 00:19:07.875\nIn compliance you're\nnever gonna be popular,\n\n391\n00:19:07.875 --> 00:19:12.695\nyou're always gonna be pretty much not\nlook on favorably, they're gonna hate you.\n\n392\n00:19:12.695 --> 00:19:13.835\nIt's the way it goes.\n\n393\n00:19:13.835 --> 00:19:16.655\nOnce you make them realize\nthat it's a business thing and\n\n394\n00:19:16.655 --> 00:19:20.005\nit's, you're there to help them,\na lot of times they'll wise up and\n\n395\n00:19:20.005 --> 00:19:23.645\nthey're realize,\nhere she is gonna help us, okay cool.\n\n396\n00:19:23.645 --> 00:19:26.470\nBut when you walk in the door,\nI guarantee you they're gonna hate you.\n\n397\n00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:29.310\nBut, if you have top down Buy In,\nthat can override that, and\n\n398\n00:19:29.310 --> 00:19:33.240\ncan help you get their trust,\nand their honest help.\n\n399\n00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:36.340\nBut on every change that is made, due to\nremediation plan you've come up with,\n\n400\n00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:40.060\nget sign off on the changes before they\nhappen, as they happen, after they happen.\n\n401\n00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:43.600\nBecause I guarantee you, if you don't,\nyou're not gonna get paid.\n\n402\n00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:45.800\nThey're gonna blame you, or\npotentially, even sue you.\n\n403\n00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:49.885\nSo, that's why you also, by the way, need\nto have errors and omissions insurance,\n\n404\n00:19:49.885 --> 00:19:52.517\ngeneral liability insurance,\numbrella insurance.\n\n405\n00:19:52.517 --> 00:19:53.860\nAm I missing any?\n\n406\n00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:55.704\nProfessional liability insurance.\n\n407\n00:19:55.704 --> 00:19:57.113\n&gt;&gt; Yes, that one.\n&gt;&gt; Client data insurance,\n\n408\n00:19:57.113 --> 00:19:59.390\nwe're not getting into it,\nit's too deep for now.\n\n409\n00:19:59.390 --> 00:20:04.151\n&gt;&gt; We'll do that on a different talk,\nbut the real important part here is that\n\n410\n00:20:04.151 --> 00:20:07.789\nhaving a top down buy in really\nhelps apply negotiation.\n\n411\n00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:11.190\n&gt;&gt; It helps apply force\nto the negotiation.\n\n412\n00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:14.062\nBecause you have somebody on\nyour side with a big stick, and\n\n413\n00:20:14.062 --> 00:20:17.003\nbasically they can come down and\nswing that stick if need be.\n\n414\n00:20:17.003 --> 00:20:20.290\nYou don't want that to happen,\nthat is a bad idea.\n\n415\n00:20:20.290 --> 00:20:24.440\nBut if it needs to happen, it's a last\nresort, but if it happens it happens.\n\n416\n00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:27.850\nI've had people fired because\nof a compliance engagement.\n\n417\n00:20:27.850 --> 00:20:29.510\nBecause they absolutely\nrefused to work with me.\n\n418\n00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:31.010\nThey refused to deal with me.\n\n419\n00:20:31.010 --> 00:20:32.320\nI went, I don't understand.\n\n420\n00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:34.000\nAm I insulting you personally?\n\n421\n00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.340\nAnd they go, no, no, no, no,\nbut you can't come in here.\n\n422\n00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:38.850\nI have to, it's part of the engagement.\n\n423\n00:20:38.850 --> 00:20:40.830\nNo, you can't.\n\n424\n00:20:40.830 --> 00:20:42.230\nThey got fired.\n\n425\n00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:43.297\nIt was just that simple.\n\n426\n00:20:43.297 --> 00:20:46.880\nIt was, this may be your department,\nbut you don't own the company.\n\n427\n00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:47.930\nGet out.\n\n428\n00:20:47.930 --> 00:20:49.430\nYou can't do that to me.\n\n429\n00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:50.360\nNo, I'm the CEO.\n\n430\n00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:51.598\nReally I can, goodbye.\n\n431\n00:20:51.598 --> 00:20:55.239\nAnd then all of a sudden it was much\neasier to get into that department and\n\n432\n00:20:55.239 --> 00:20:58.280\nfind out that they were\nactually in compliance.\n\n433\n00:20:58.280 --> 00:21:00.356\nAll they had to do was open the door and\nthey would have been fine.\n\n434\n00:21:00.356 --> 00:21:03.120\n&gt;&gt; So you're saying instead of doing\nthe smart thing like I don't know,\n\n435\n00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:05.570\nasking questions, right?\n\n436\n00:21:05.570 --> 00:21:10.190\nWhich really could have led to that event\nnot happening, that they didn't do it.\n\n437\n00:21:10.190 --> 00:21:14.202\nBut being able to ask questions when\nyou're dealing with remediation and\n\n438\n00:21:14.202 --> 00:21:16.993\nnegotiation is always a very key feature,\nright?\n\n439\n00:21:16.993 --> 00:21:21.890\nSo with that being said, if you have\nquestions for us, please reach out.\n\n440\n00:21:21.890 --> 00:21:24.936\nI'm Scott Lyons,\nyou can reach me on Twitter @csp3r,\n\n441\n00:21:24.936 --> 00:21:29.960\nC-S-P-3-R, or Slyons@redlion.io.\n\n442\n00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:31.060\n&gt;&gt;
