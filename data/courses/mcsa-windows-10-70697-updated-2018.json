You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n&gt;&gt; Welcome everyone to your\n\n6\n00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.480\nConfigure Windows Devices series.\n\n7\n00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.750\nIf you're studying for the 70-697,\nthen you're in the perfect place.\n\n8\n00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:22.900\nI'm your host, Cherokee Boose, and\nin this episode, specifically,\n\n9\n00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:27.530\nwe'll be looking at how we can support\nour Microsoft Store and cloud apps.\n\n10\n00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:30.710\nAnd with us today in studios we have Mr.\nMike Rodrick.\n\n11\n00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:31.920\nHow's it going today, Mike?\n\n12\n00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.130\nGreat, Cherokee, thanks for having me.\n\n13\n00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:37.800\nExcited as always to talk about Windows\n10, and good old Microsoft store apps,\n\n14\n00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.890\ncloud apps, all these apps that\nwe've got to support, right?\n\n15\n00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:42.390\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n16\n00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:43.208\n&gt;&gt; All right, so,\n\n17\n00:00:43.208 --> 00:00:46.140\nthat's what we're gonna take a look at.\nOne of the objectives,\n\n18\n00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.810\nthey call it, as you said,\nthe 70-697 exam.\n\n19\n00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:50.510\nThey talk about intergrating\na Microsoft account\n\n20\n00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.530\nincluding personalization settings.\n\n21\n00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.420\nAnd so that's what I wanna look at today.\n\n22\n00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.410\nAnd this is something that's\nactually kind of influx right now.\n\n23\n00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.270\nAs we're shooting these episodes,\nthings are a changing as they like to say.\n\n24\n00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.470\nI don't know where, or\n\n25\n00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.030\nwho likes to say that, but.\n&gt;&gt; Like this is the only\n\n26\n00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:09.164\nthing that's changing here-\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n\n27\n00:01:09.164 --> 00:01:09.995\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and\n\n28\n00:01:09.995 --> 00:01:14.575\nthe reason I say this is because a lot\nof the documentation that you'll go out.\n\n29\n00:01:14.575 --> 00:01:18.201\nAnd you might read as you're preparing for\nthis exam is gonna talk about\n\n30\n00:01:18.201 --> 00:01:21.414\nassociating a Microsoft account\nwith either a local account.\n\n31\n00:01:21.414 --> 00:01:25.693\nMeaning I've got a workgroup machine or\nmy home machine that I've logged\n\n32\n00:01:25.693 --> 00:01:29.190\non with a local account and\nI have a Microsoft account.\n\n33\n00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:32.630\nI can associate that Microsoft\naccount with my local account.\n\n34\n00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.560\nAnd it's gonna allow me to synchronize\nsettings, and some other things.\n\n35\n00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.120\nAnd we'll talk about that in a second.\n\n36\n00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.560\nBut then the documentation will also say\nthat you could do the same thing with\n\n37\n00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.050\na domain account.\n\n38\n00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.160\nBut what's happening is Microsoft\nis changing that a little bit.\n\n39\n00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:50.010\nAs of right now, there isn't a way\nto associate your Microsoft account\n\n40\n00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:51.140\nwith your domain account.\n\n41\n00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.640\nAnd I'll show you where\nthat setting is missing.\n\n42\n00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.650\nThere's still a group policy that it gives\nthe administrators the ability to block\n\n43\n00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:58.610\nMicrosoft accounts.\n\n44\n00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.330\nBut it seems like Microsoft might be\ndoing this a little in the background.\n\n45\n00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.680\nAnd I found an obscure blog\nthat is relatively recent, and\n\n46\n00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.950\nfrom some people at Microsoft.\n\n47\n00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.460\nThat were talking about\nhow a lot of the IT people\n\n48\n00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:12.270\nthat they'd talked to had\ncomplained about this.\n\n49\n00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.670\nThought it was a security risk,\nbeing able to synchronize settings from my\n\n50\n00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:20.160\ndomain systems with systems that\nare out of my enterprise's control.\n\n51\n00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.692\nNow with my home devices,\nlaptops, things like that.\n\n52\n00:02:23.692 --> 00:02:25.310\nAnd so maybe I mean,\n\n53\n00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.550\nI'm trying to put logic to what\nMicrosoft's doing, I obviously don't know.\n\n54\n00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:34.090\nBut the option is missing, that's the\npoint along stories that is trying to say,\n\n55\n00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:35.350\nthat option's not there.\n&gt;&gt; Well thank you for\n\n56\n00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:38.240\nbringing it to our attention, because\nI know I certainly encountered that.\n\n57\n00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:43.810\nAnd it's not, we're not saying don't study\nand don't proceed with your studies here.\n\n58\n00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.720\nIt's just, be aware of it so\nyou can evolve as well.\n\n59\n00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.170\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and so we'll talk about it.\n\n60\n00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.590\nI'll show you how it used to be, how it is\nnow, and then that way when you go into\n\n61\n00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.288\nthe exam you'll be prepared for\neither, whatever they ask you.\n\n62\n00:02:57.288 --> 00:03:00.350\nWhat we're gonna do, again a Microsoft\naccount is simply an account that I go out\n\n63\n00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:03.370\nand I create through Microsoft, it's free.\n\n64\n00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:09.980\nYou can create either a .outlook.com or\na .hotmail.com account.\n\n65\n00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:15.140\nAnd when you use a Microsoft account\nto log in to your systems or associate\n\n66\n00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:19.790\nthat with an account, it'll allow you\nto synchronize settings across devices.\n\n67\n00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.240\nBasically because you\nhave a Microsoft account\n\n68\n00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:25.090\nyou have a little slice of\nstorage out there in the cloud.\n\n69\n00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.810\nAnd we can choose to\nsynchronize certain settings.\n\n70\n00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.470\nWhat'll happen is it'll store\nthose settings up in the cloud.\n\n71\n00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.410\nAnd if I go to a different system and\n\n72\n00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:37.310\nlog on, it can retrieve those settings and\nset them on that machine as well.\n\n73\n00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:41.550\nThings like my background, my favorites,\nand a few other things, themes and things\n\n74\n00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:45.490\nlike that, can be synchronized across\nmultiple devices, which is kind of cool.\n\n75\n00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:48.790\nI like that concept,\nit works out pretty well.\n\n76\n00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:49.900\n&gt;&gt; I'm just waiting for\n\n77\n00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.630\ntheir new phone to come out, Windows\nphone, they've been talking about it for\n\n78\n00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:57.985\nyears now, and that would just be perfect.\n&gt;&gt; Don't hold you breath, right?\n\n79\n00:03:57.985 --> 00:03:59.702\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n80\n00:03:59.702 --> 00:04:00.240\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n81\n00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:02.430\nlet's take a look at my screen here and\nwe will get started.\n\n82\n00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.500\nI have a Windows 10 machine.\n\n83\n00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:09.000\nI'm currently logged on with\na local account named Mike, right?\n\n84\n00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.540\nAnd this is just a standard,\nit's the local admin.\n\n85\n00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.910\nIn fact, I think it's the first\naccount on the system.\n\n86\n00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:15.410\nBut it's nothing special.\n\n87\n00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:16.780\nIt's just a local account.\n\n88\n00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:19.810\nAnd what I'm gonna do,\nI'm gonna go to my Settings.\n\n89\n00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:21.040\nI'm going to click on Accounts.\n\n90\n00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:26.509\nUnderneath your info, that top node there,\nI can see my account,\n\n91\n00:04:26.509 --> 00:04:29.910\nMike it's a local account,\nmeaning it's stored in the local SAM file.\n\n92\n00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:32.010\nIt's not a domain account or\nanything like that.\n\n93\n00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:35.260\nAnd then down below here,\nwe can see where it says Windows is better\n\n94\n00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.430\nwhen your settings and\nfiles are automatically synced.\n\n95\n00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:39.200\nUse a Microsoft account instead.\n\n96\n00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.080\nSign in with a Microsoft account instead.\n\n97\n00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:46.730\nSo if click this link it's gonna\nopen up a dialogue box and\n\n98\n00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:49.170\nit's going to ask me for\nmy Microsoft account.\n\n99\n00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:55.633\nSo I'll type in, so what's one of\nmy accounts that I can use here.\n\n100\n00:04:55.633 --> 00:04:59.554\nWe will try that one, we will click next\nI think I remember my password for that.\n\n101\n00:05:02.732 --> 00:05:03.710\nAnd we'll sign in.\n\n102\n00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:07.870\nAnd now what it's asking me for, and\n\n103\n00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:10.070\nI should've done that a little slower,\nright?\n\n104\n00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:14.210\nFirst it asked me for my username,\nright, mikerodrick@outlook.com.\n\n105\n00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:15.870\nThat's my Microsoft account.\n\n106\n00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:18.930\nThen it asks me for the password for\nthat Microsoft account.\n\n107\n00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:22.610\nMake sure it's actually my account, that\nI own it and I have permission to use it.\n\n108\n00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:27.180\nNow it's asking me for my,\nnotice it says current Windows password.\n\n109\n00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:31.300\nTo verify that I am the owner\nof this local account as well.\n\n110\n00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:35.120\nCuz what if I had left myself logged in,\nand somebody else walked up.\n\n111\n00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:37.880\nAnd they could have gone into,\nif I had left myself logged in\n\n112\n00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:40.765\nthey could've easily opened\nsettings gone into hear your info.\n\n113\n00:05:40.765 --> 00:05:45.190\nChose to sync your Microsoft account\nused one that they know, right.\n\n114\n00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:49.250\nAnd then they could turn around and\nlog in to the system as me.\n\n115\n00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:52.550\nThat's what they're trying to prevent\nhere making sure it's actually me.\n\n116\n00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:56.100\nI got to remember my\npassword on this machine.\n\n117\n00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:58.510\nHopefully that's the right one.\n\n118\n00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:01.210\nWe shall see.\n\n119\n00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:03.120\nSo basically you have to\nput in both passwords.\n\n120\n00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:07.420\nThe password for your Microsoft account,\nand the password for your local account.\n\n121\n00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:10.480\nAnd now it's telling me use\nWindows Hello instead of your password.\n\n122\n00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:14.900\nWe've got several episodes where we deal\nwith Windows Hello, how we can use PINs or\n\n123\n00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:16.530\nbiometrics to authenticate.\n\n124\n00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:19.480\nAnd actually it didn't click on\nanything and the window went away.\n\n125\n00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:22.800\nI guess it gave up and\nsaid he must not be doing that, and\n\n126\n00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:24.330\nclosed itself.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n127\n00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:26.127\n&gt;&gt; I haven't seen that before, but\n\n128\n00:06:26.127 --> 00:06:26.838\n[SOUND] okay.\n\n129\n00:06:26.838 --> 00:06:29.020\nAnd now you will see my\ninformation has changed, right?\n\n130\n00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:32.830\nIt says mikeroderick@outlook.com\nas an administrator.\n\n131\n00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:39.550\nSo now my Microsoft account is\nassociated with my local account.\n\n132\n00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:46.705\nAnd if I log off,\nWhen I go to log back on,\n\n133\n00:06:46.705 --> 00:06:51.640\nI'll be logging on, those to, sorry,\nyou have to look at my face there twice.\n\n134\n00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:55.330\nBut you notice it's pulling all of\nmy information from that account.\n\n135\n00:06:55.330 --> 00:07:00.370\nAnd now I'm gonna be using the password\nfor my Microsoft account to log in.\n\n136\n00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:04.040\nSo it's kinda like this account has,\nit's associated with, but\n\n137\n00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:06.120\nit's almost taken over my local account.\n\n138\n00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:09.860\nI don't see that local account, I don't\nuse that local account password anymore.\n\n139\n00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:13.490\nI can if I choose to do at some point,\noops,\n\n140\n00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:17.180\ngo back into my settings and my accounts.\n\n141\n00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:21.350\nAnd I can choose sign-in\nwith local account instead.\n\n142\n00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:24.480\nSo I could remove my Microsoft\naccount from this system.\n\n143\n00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:25.240\n&gt;&gt; And sometimes,\n\n144\n00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:27.940\nI have my personal\ncomputer setup like that.\n\n145\n00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:32.020\nAnd if I don't have an internet\nconnection and you're just so\n\n146\n00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:36.840\nused to typing in your Outlook password,\nor whatever.\n\n147\n00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:38.790\nAnd if you forget about that.\n\n148\n00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:43.850\nIt will remind you to use\nthe local the local password or\n\n149\n00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:45.040\nPIN there.\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, all right,\n\n150\n00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:49.300\nnow that we are signed it with a Microsoft\naccount I can click sync your settings.\n\n151\n00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:54.103\nAnd this is where I can choose what\nsettings I want to synchronize.\n\n152\n00:07:54.103 --> 00:07:57.428\nI can turn the whole thing on or off and\nmaybe I don't want any settings to\n\n153\n00:07:57.428 --> 00:08:00.046\nsynchronize between the devices\nevery device I use is.\n\n154\n00:08:00.046 --> 00:08:02.568\nSeparate, I don't want any of\nthose settings pulling across.\n\n155\n00:08:02.568 --> 00:08:04.298\nI can turn it off altogether.\n\n156\n00:08:04.298 --> 00:08:07.598\nThe choices I have, theme,\nInternet Explorer settings,\n\n157\n00:08:07.598 --> 00:08:11.030\nbecause that is still\neverybody's favorite browser.\n\n158\n00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:13.670\nPasswords notice is turned on,\nbut it’s grayed out.\n\n159\n00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:18.640\nAnd it says passwords won't sync until\nyou verify your identity on this device.\n\n160\n00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:22.570\nAnd in order to do that I can click verify\nand it's going to do the whole thing.\n\n161\n00:08:22.570 --> 00:08:28.230\nIt will send you a text to a phone or you\ncould choose I don't have any of these.\n\n162\n00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:30.220\nMaybe choose a different option.\n\n163\n00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:33.740\nI'm not going to do that on this test\nmachine just because I don't want my\n\n164\n00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:35.400\npassword syncing with this.\n\n165\n00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:37.410\nBut just understand you have that option.\n\n166\n00:08:37.410 --> 00:08:42.220\nBut a great test question right,\nyou can sync everything except passwords\n\n167\n00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:45.340\nin order to sync passwords you\nhave to verify your account,\n\n168\n00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:48.650\nmeaning you're gonna have to get one of\nthose security codes texted to your phone.\n\n169\n00:08:48.650 --> 00:08:50.710\nEnter that code into the system so\nit knows it's you,\n\n170\n00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:54.770\nand then you can start syncing\npasswords across multiple devices.\n\n171\n00:08:54.770 --> 00:08:56.810\nLanguage preferences, ease of access,\n\n172\n00:08:56.810 --> 00:09:01.460\nand other random Windows settings\nthat Microsoft chooses to include.\n\n173\n00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:03.540\nAll right, so that's all well and\ngood on this one system.\n\n174\n00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:05.600\nBut syncing really isn't all that exciting\n\n175\n00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:06.708\nunless you get another system.\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n176\n00:09:06.708 --> 00:09:07.640\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n177\n00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:09.780\nSo, let's take a look\nat a different machine.\n\n178\n00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:12.180\nI'm going to do it a little\nbit differently here.\n\n179\n00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:16.790\nSo, this another, again, Windows 10\nlaptop, but I don't have an account.\n\n180\n00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:18.460\nI don't have a local account on this.\n\n181\n00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:23.220\nSo, what I want to do is go into accounts,\nand\n\n182\n00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:25.790\nshow you a different\nway you could do this.\n\n183\n00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:30.240\nThis is Melissa's computer, and so,\nwhat she can do it go to family and\n\n184\n00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:33.420\nother people,\nrather than create me a local account.\n\n185\n00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:35.560\nAnd then I log in with a local account.\n\n186\n00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:39.205\nAnd then I associate my Microsoft\naccount with that local account.\n\n187\n00:09:39.205 --> 00:09:42.660\nShe can simply add a Microsoft\naccount right here.\n\n188\n00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:43.920\nOther people.\n\n189\n00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:48.670\nAdd someone to this PC.\n&gt;&gt; I actually went just through\n\n190\n00:09:48.670 --> 00:09:50.190\nthis the other night with my son.\n\n191\n00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:55.230\nHe's getting to that like age where he's\nstarting to get his own accounts and such,\n\n192\n00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:59.250\nso I actually gave him a Microsoft,\nlike an online account.\n\n193\n00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:02.980\nAnd every time I had set him up before,\nI always created a local account.\n\n194\n00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:05.140\nAnd then he said okay Mom,\nso what's the password.\n\n195\n00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:07.740\nAnd I'm like,\nit's the password to your email account.\n\n196\n00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:09.760\nHe's like like I didn't even.\n\n197\n00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:10.439\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so [LAUGH]\n\n198\n00:10:10.439 --> 00:10:11.423\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, and\n\n199\n00:10:11.423 --> 00:10:14.400\nthat gives you the ability to control.\n&gt;&gt; The parental controls.\n\n200\n00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:15.385\n&gt;&gt; All kinds of things,\n\n201\n00:10:15.385 --> 00:10:17.530\nyeah with the parental controls,\nvery good.\n\n202\n00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:21.260\nAll right, so if Melissa wants to\nallow me to log into this machine,\n\n203\n00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:24.004\nshe can come in here and\nchoose to add another person.\n\n204\n00:10:24.004 --> 00:10:28.011\nmikeroderick@outlook.com, next, and\n\n205\n00:10:28.011 --> 00:10:33.205\nthat's it right,\nthat's all that she needs to know is,\n\n206\n00:10:33.205 --> 00:10:39.782\nI want to allow this Microsoft\naccount to log into this system.\n\n207\n00:10:39.782 --> 00:10:45.298\nAll right, so I'll click close on that,\nand I will switch user.\n\n208\n00:10:45.298 --> 00:10:50.120\nNotice that mikerodrick@outlook.com\nshowed up on the list,\n\n209\n00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:52.480\nthere it is,\nI type in the appropriate password.\n\n210\n00:10:56.810 --> 00:11:01.680\nAnd it's now basically creating an account\nand a profile for me on this machine so\n\n211\n00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:05.540\nit will have to go through this initial\nphase of hey welcome while we get\n\n212\n00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:09.860\nthings set up and downloads all\nthe bloatware, I mean cool apps, that\n\n213\n00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:14.460\nMicrosoft wants to put on my start menu\nand eventually it will say let's start.\n\n214\n00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:16.356\nI was kinda hoping my\ntiming would be better and\n\n215\n00:11:16.356 --> 00:11:19.446\nit would start when I said that.\n&gt;&gt; It's okay cuz I'll talk about something\n\n216\n00:11:19.446 --> 00:11:21.380\nhere, there's lots to talk about, right?\n\n217\n00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:22.950\nBut apps, right?\n\n218\n00:11:22.950 --> 00:11:25.740\nSo back in the day I know\nI spoke about this before,\n\n219\n00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:27.950\nbut, I used to call them programs.\n\n220\n00:11:27.950 --> 00:11:30.715\nFor like any kind of Microsoft\nbinary that you would install,\n\n221\n00:11:30.715 --> 00:11:31.840\nusually with a CD or DVD.\n\n222\n00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:35.340\nBut now you hear this\nterm apps all the time.\n\n223\n00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:38.220\nBut sometimes it's spelled differently.\n\n224\n00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:42.380\nAnd I think Microsoft really,\nwhen you see that capital APPS,\n\n225\n00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:46.630\nthey're really referring to like\ntheir cloud or Microsoft store apps.\n\n226\n00:11:46.630 --> 00:11:51.130\nAnd then if you have third party\nsoftware that you're installing,\n\n227\n00:11:51.130 --> 00:11:55.290\nthen you can call an application,\nso that the app etiquette, I guess?\n\n228\n00:11:55.290 --> 00:11:57.430\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, cuz your apps, or your Windows,\n\n229\n00:11:57.430 --> 00:11:59.630\nuniversal Windows platform developed apps.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n230\n00:11:59.630 --> 00:12:04.480\nVersus the old school desktop apps which\ninstall differently, and yeah, absolutely.\n\n231\n00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:05.900\nAll right, so\nhere it's saying the same thing.\n\n232\n00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:08.380\nThey really want us to use Windows Hello.\n\n233\n00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:10.100\nAnd again,\nwe've talked about this in other episodes.\n\n234\n00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:12.910\nIt's a much more secure way to\nauthenticate to your system.\n\n235\n00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:14.880\nWe really should do that.\n\n236\n00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:16.240\nI'm gonna click next.\n\n237\n00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:17.420\nIt's really confusing.\n\n238\n00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:20.380\nThis screen throws some people\noff cuz it doesn't look like\n\n239\n00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:21.710\nthere's any way to skip this.\n\n240\n00:12:21.710 --> 00:12:23.700\nIt says use Windows Hello\ninstead of your password.\n\n241\n00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:24.880\nSet up a PIN.\n\n242\n00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:26.280\nWhat if you don't want to?\n\n243\n00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:30.060\nWell, you click next to move\nto the next screen, and\n\n244\n00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:33.350\nthen just click cancel\ninstead of setting up a PIN.\n\n245\n00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:35.150\nI would recommend you do set up a PIN.\n\n246\n00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:36.210\nIt's more secure, but\n\n247\n00:12:36.210 --> 00:12:39.560\nI just wanted to show you how you\ncould get in without setting up a PIN.\n\n248\n00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:43.130\nAnd then you see down here it says,\ndid you mean to cancel?\n\n249\n00:12:43.130 --> 00:12:43.850\nMy gosh.\n\n250\n00:12:43.850 --> 00:12:44.960\nDon't cancel.\n\n251\n00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:46.580\nI'll set up a PIN later.\n\n252\n00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:51.130\nWink, wink, maybe I will, maybe I won't,\nbut that's for me to decide, Microsoft.\n\n253\n00:12:51.130 --> 00:12:54.520\nAnd I could set up my OneDrive,\nwhich would be a good idea.\n\n254\n00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:55.950\nI'll go ahead and click next.\n\n255\n00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:00.830\nAnd that'll allow it, again,\nto connect out to my OneDrive account,\n\n256\n00:13:00.830 --> 00:13:03.270\nbecause remember,\nOneDrive is also Cloud based.\n\n257\n00:13:03.270 --> 00:13:06.260\nSo now on both machines\nusing this user account,\n\n258\n00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:08.970\nI have access to that\nsame OneDrive storage.\n\n259\n00:13:08.970 --> 00:13:12.480\nSo files that I've put up there from this\ndevice, I can go to the other device and\n\n260\n00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:15.310\nlog in with that same account and\naccess those same files.\n\n261\n00:13:15.310 --> 00:13:20.060\nSo there's lots of benefits of using\na Microsoft account to log into your\n\n262\n00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:22.510\nWindows 10 machines.\n\n263\n00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:28.770\nAs I go to Settings here, now that I'm\nlogged in I can go to accounts and\n\n264\n00:13:28.770 --> 00:13:32.790\nsync my settings and\nagain you'll see the same options.\n\n265\n00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:35.750\nEverything except for passwords is set up.\n\n266\n00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:38.220\nNow let's do this.\n\n267\n00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:42.150\nLet me see if I have any, yeah,\n\n268\n00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:45.200\nit's still doing a few of those\nsetting up your profile things.\n\n269\n00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:47.720\nSo certain things are not responding.\n\n270\n00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:52.130\nYou can see File Explorer is\njust not wanting to open up.\n\n271\n00:13:52.130 --> 00:13:55.130\nLet's go back over to the first machine,\nit should be done by now.\n\n272\n00:13:55.130 --> 00:13:58.600\nAnd really all I wanted to do let me see\nif I've got a picture in here, yeah.\n\n273\n00:14:00.390 --> 00:14:01.590\nI'm gonna change my background,\n\n274\n00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:06.150\nnow again on this background we've\ngot that default Windows background.\n\n275\n00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:10.480\nOver here default Windows background,\nmachine is still not responding.\n\n276\n00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:13.910\nIt's actually setting up\nOneDrive at this point and so\n\n277\n00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:15.980\nit's making the machine a little bit busy.\n\n278\n00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:17.010\nI wanna change my background.\n\n279\n00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:20.570\nLet's set that as the desktop background.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\n\n280\n00:14:20.570 --> 00:14:24.399\nis it gonna happen in real time?\n&gt;&gt; All right, well, let's find out.\n\n281\n00:14:24.399 --> 00:14:25.579\nProbably not because this machine is so\n\n282\n00:14:25.579 --> 00:14:26.206\ndarn busy right now\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n283\n00:14:26.206 --> 00:14:27.849\n&gt;&gt; So I've got OneDrive but\n\n284\n00:14:27.849 --> 00:14:32.153\nwhat will happen is in a few minutes\nit'll actually just change my\n\n285\n00:14:32.153 --> 00:14:33.530\nbackground.\n&gt;&gt; Wow, okay.\n\n286\n00:14:33.530 --> 00:14:36.840\n&gt;&gt; I can try to speed it up by logging off\n\n287\n00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:38.400\nand logging back on.\n\n288\n00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:39.890\nAnd I probably should.\n\n289\n00:14:39.890 --> 00:14:41.820\nLet me log off of this machine as well\n\n290\n00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:47.570\nto make sure it's synchronizing those\nsettings and storing them up in the Cloud.\n\n291\n00:14:47.570 --> 00:14:52.040\nSo, back to home two which is where\nI had that standard background.\n\n292\n00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:53.240\nLet me log back in.\n\n293\n00:14:57.270 --> 00:14:59.520\nAnd see if it has taken place yet.\n\n294\n00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:01.570\nFingers crossed drum roll please.\n\n295\n00:15:01.570 --> 00:15:02.860\nAnd nothing.\n\n296\n00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:05.810\nBut I promise you it will\neventually kick over.\n\n297\n00:15:05.810 --> 00:15:10.470\nIt's not a quite instantaneous again\nbecause this account was just created and\n\n298\n00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:11.997\nit's doing a lot of\nthings in the background.\n\n299\n00:15:11.997 --> 00:15:17.970\nBut I know like I do the same thing in my\nhome with my laptop and my home desktop.\n\n300\n00:15:17.970 --> 00:15:22.140\nI can change the background on one,\nwalk over to the home machine, and\n\n301\n00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:23.960\nit's already changed over there.\n\n302\n00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:25.640\nSo it does occur pretty fast, but\n\n303\n00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:29.668\nthis is just the initial account setup\nthat's probably making it take a little\n\n304\n00:15:29.668 --> 00:15:31.090\nwhile all right.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n305\n00:15:31.090 --> 00:15:35.570\nthe background, maybe that's\nnot what everyone's cup of tea.\n\n306\n00:15:35.570 --> 00:15:37.060\nBut one of the things you had showed us,\n\n307\n00:15:37.060 --> 00:15:39.580\nMike, you showed us those\naccessibility options.\n\n308\n00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:43.600\nAnd think about how helpful that could be\nfor someone if you have someone assist and\n\n309\n00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:46.688\nhelp them getting their laptops\nconfigured a certain way, and\n\n310\n00:15:46.688 --> 00:15:49.650\nthey don't have the means\nto go through that again.\n\n311\n00:15:49.650 --> 00:15:53.180\nIndependently or something,\nand it's like updating and\n\n312\n00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:56.300\nit doesn't have that secondary machine,\ndoesn't have to be reconfigured.\n\n313\n00:15:56.300 --> 00:15:58.500\nIt's just pulling all those\nsettings from the other ones,\n\n314\n00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:01.338\nthat's really cool actually.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah absolutely, it's really nice,\n\n315\n00:16:01.338 --> 00:16:04.671\nif at all you're the one that needs those\naccessibility options where all those\n\n316\n00:16:04.671 --> 00:16:05.180\nsettings.\n\n317\n00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:07.179\nRight.\n&gt;&gt;

So\n\n349\n00:17:51.730 --> 00:17:54.090\nyou still see that segregation there.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah so\n\n350\n00:17:54.090 --> 00:17:57.490\nthis is the only way,\nyou cannot sync settings\n\n351\n00:17:57.490 --> 00:18:01.680\nfrom domain accounts with your Microsoft\naccounts at this point with Windows.\n\n352\n00:18:02.860 --> 00:18:07.130\nAll right, so let's see what is next, back\nover to that domain controller real quick,\n\n353\n00:18:07.130 --> 00:18:08.410\nif he's loaded up,\n\n354\n00:18:08.410 --> 00:18:14.000\nI did wanna show you the group policy just\nin case they would ask you on the exam.\n\n355\n00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:20.000\nSo, I am going to navigate,\nthis is again a Windows 10 exam, right?\n\n356\n00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.760\nBut they might ask you some questions,\nnot so much about how to do it, but\n\n357\n00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:24.405\nbeing familiar.\n\n358\n00:18:24.405 --> 00:18:27.390\nCuz if I have to troubleshoot,\nI have to understand what's going on.\n\n359\n00:18:27.390 --> 00:18:28.980\nAnd why isn't this working?\n\n360\n00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:33.440\nWhy can't I associate my Microsoft\naccount with my domain account?\n\n361\n00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:34.870\nNow, careful with that, right?\n\n362\n00:18:34.870 --> 00:18:40.140\nI just told you it seems like Microsoft is\nchanging it so you can't do that anymore.\n\n363\n00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:46.430\nBut the exam ref and other reference\nmaterial that you study says you can.\n\n364\n00:18:46.430 --> 00:18:49.940\nAnd they also point out how administrators\ncan block it if they want to.\n\n365\n00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:51.920\nSo, I wanna show you that option at least.\n\n366\n00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:56.713\nIf you go into computer configuration.\n\n367\n00:18:56.713 --> 00:18:59.940\nGosh where is that guy at?\n\n368\n00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:05.694\nPolicies, Windows settings,\n\n369\n00:19:05.694 --> 00:19:13.080\nsecurity settings, local policies.\n\n370\n00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:13.850\nThere it is.\n\n371\n00:19:15.340 --> 00:19:18.360\nSometimes remembering the path\nto these policies can be tricky.\n\n372\n00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:21.260\nThe computer configuration\npolicy is Windows settings,\n\n373\n00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:24.870\nsecurity settings,\nlocal policies, security options.\n\n374\n00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:27.780\nSo, buried way down in there,\nhere's the option right here.\n\n375\n00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:30.090\nBlock Microsoft accounts.\n\n376\n00:19:30.090 --> 00:19:32.800\nNow, if I double click on that\nyou'll see it's not defined.\n\n377\n00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:35.540\nSo at this point I'm not\nblocking Microsoft accounts yet\n\n378\n00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:38.590\nI cannot associate a Microsoft\naccount with my domain account.\n\n379\n00:19:38.590 --> 00:19:39.350\nThat's what I was saying.\n\n380\n00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:41.540\nMicrosoft seems to be changing things.\n\n381\n00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:45.610\nBut for the exam know if they ask you.\n&gt;&gt; Where would you go to block\n\n382\n00:19:45.610 --> 00:19:48.432\na user?\n&gt;&gt; Yes, cuz they'll give you a scenario\n\n383\n00:19:48.432 --> 00:19:52.080\nthey'll say you're an administrator for\na corporate environment.\n\n384\n00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:56.510\nYou're running 2016 servers and\nyou're running Windows 10 clients.\n\n385\n00:19:56.510 --> 00:20:00.290\nAnd your company doesn't want your\nusers using Microsoft accounts.\n\n386\n00:20:00.290 --> 00:20:01.600\nHow would you prevent that?\n\n387\n00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:02.630\nAnd you need to be able to tell and\n\n388\n00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:06.050\nthere's a group policy that you can set,\nBlock Microsoft Accounts.\n\n389\n00:20:06.050 --> 00:20:10.550\nI can turn this on and I can say,\nUsers Can't Add Microsoft Accounts.\n\n390\n00:20:10.550 --> 00:20:11.210\nRemember what I said,\n\n391\n00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:16.390\neven on domainic machine I could\ngive a Microsoft account access.\n\n392\n00:20:16.390 --> 00:20:19.230\nI can't associate it\nwith my domain account.\n\n393\n00:20:19.230 --> 00:20:22.840\nBut I can give it permission to\nlog on to that client machine.\n\n394\n00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:24.590\nThis option would prevent that.\n\n395\n00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:30.990\nI don't want somebody logging on to their\ndomain machine using Microsoft accounts.\n\n396\n00:20:30.990 --> 00:20:32.000\nSo I can choose that.\n\n397\n00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:35.660\nThey also have users can't add or\nlogin with Microsoft accounts and\n\n398\n00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:38.130\nagain, that would end up\nblocking that ability.\n\n399\n00:20:38.130 --> 00:20:41.090\nSo for the exam,\nunderstand that that option is there.\n\n400\n00:20:41.090 --> 00:20:41.922\nIn the real world,\n\n401\n00:20:41.922 --> 00:20:45.970\nunderstand that I can't associate a\nMicrosoft account with my domain account,\n\n402\n00:20:45.970 --> 00:20:49.950\nbut I can give it permission to log on and\nthat's how I would block it.\n\n403\n00:20:49.950 --> 00:20:51.230\nAll right, hopefully that's enough.\n\n404\n00:20:51.230 --> 00:20:55.920\nThat was a lot talking about a relatively\nsimple thing, but like I said,\n\n405\n00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:57.885\nit's changing and\nit gets a little bit confusing.\n\n406\n00:20:57.885 --> 00:21:00.030\nWanna make sure we're\nall on the same page.\n\n407\n00:21:00.030 --> 00:21:01.230\nAll right, next thing they call out.\n\n408\n00:21:01.230 --> 00:21:04.418\nInstall a managed software\nusing Microsoft Office 365.\n\n409\n00:21:04.418 --> 00:21:09.350\nSo that is what we are going to do next.\n\n410\n00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:16.240\nAnd Office 365, or Microsoft Office 365,\nis their cloud based Office solution.\n\n411\n00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:20.450\nAll right, it allows me to manage\na subscription based service as\n\n412\n00:21:20.450 --> 00:21:25.540\nan organization, I can provide Office\nthrough the cloud to my users.\n\n413\n00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:30.870\nBut I have to have licenses, and I have\nto assign those licenses to my users.\n\n414\n00:21:30.870 --> 00:21:35.946\nOnce I have assigned them a license,\nthey can log into portal.office.com or\n\n415\n00:21:35.946 --> 00:21:37.900\nmicrosoftonline.com.\n\n416\n00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:39.940\nAnd they can access\nthe Office applications, and\n\n417\n00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:43.820\nthey can run Cloud versions of\nthose Office applications, or\n\n418\n00:21:43.820 --> 00:21:46.960\nthey can install them\nlocally on their machine.\n\n419\n00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:49.410\nSo let's take a look at that.\n\n420\n00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:57.164\nI'm gonna navigate out\nto portal.office.com.\n\n421\n00:21:59.150 --> 00:22:01.110\nI'm gonna log in with my\n\n422\n00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:10.644\norganizations portal, office portal,\n\n423\n00:22:10.644 --> 00:22:15.620\nand from here you can actually\nsee that I already have\n\n424\n00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:19.710\na license assigned to my account and\nI show certain apps here.\n\n425\n00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:23.370\nAnd I can click on explore\nall of your apps and\n\n426\n00:22:23.370 --> 00:22:26.440\nI'll get to see all the different\napps that I can install.\n\n427\n00:22:27.630 --> 00:22:29.780\nExcel, Forms, Onedrive.\n\n428\n00:22:29.780 --> 00:22:33.980\nAnd what apps show up here really depends\non the subscription level that you have.\n\n429\n00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:37.040\nSo don't assume that you'll always\nsee these same applications.\n\n430\n00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:40.330\nDepends on what kind of license you\nhave purchased, or subscription you have\n\n431\n00:22:40.330 --> 00:22:44.290\npurchased from Microsoft.\n&gt;&gt; And sometimes even if the administrator\n\n432\n00:22:44.290 --> 00:22:47.570\ndoesn't want you to install certain apps,\nthey may only show you what\n\n433\n00:22:47.570 --> 00:22:49.670\nthey would allow to be installed, too.\n&gt;&gt; Yep, absolutely.\n\n434\n00:22:49.670 --> 00:22:53.730\nAll right, so if I click on admin,\nthis is gonna open up another page.\n\n435\n00:22:53.730 --> 00:22:57.540\nIt's my adming portal for Office 365.\n\n436\n00:22:57.540 --> 00:23:01.330\nAnd from here, I can go to Users and\nActive Users, and\n\n437\n00:23:01.330 --> 00:23:04.530\nI can see user accounts\nthat exist in my directory.\n\n438\n00:23:04.530 --> 00:23:06.910\nAnd I can see the status, right?\n\n439\n00:23:06.910 --> 00:23:08.820\nI can see some are unlicensed.\n\n440\n00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:11.677\nSome have this Enterprise Mobility and\n\n441\n00:23:11.677 --> 00:23:16.550\nSecurity as well as Office 365 for\nbusiness, right?\n\n442\n00:23:16.550 --> 00:23:19.660\nAnd again, this is more of\nthe server side of things, but\n\n443\n00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:23.960\non this exam, they might expect me to\nunderstand what could be going wrong.\n\n444\n00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:27.660\nWhy can't Daniel install any\nof the office applications,\n\n445\n00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:29.670\nbecause he's not licensed, right?\n\n446\n00:23:29.670 --> 00:23:31.420\nNow, I might not be able to do it myself.\n\n447\n00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:35.600\nI might have to get my office admin\nto go in there and give the license.\n\n448\n00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:39.200\nBut as a help desk person I would need\nto understand what the problem was and\n\n449\n00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:43.670\nhow to escalate it appropriately so\nthat the problem could get solved, right?\n\n450\n00:23:43.670 --> 00:23:49.240\nSo if I click on Dan's name, I come in\nhere and I look at product licenses.\n\n451\n00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:50.570\nAnd I can assign a license.\n\n452\n00:23:50.570 --> 00:23:54.100\nAnd actually, you know what before I\nassign the license, let's flip back over\n\n453\n00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:58.732\nhere to a client machine.\n&gt;&gt; Are we gonna check to see how\n\n454\n00:23:58.732 --> 00:24:00.247\nmany we have?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well,\n\n455\n00:24:00.247 --> 00:24:05.649\nlet's see what happens with a log-on and\nthey're not licensed, versus are, right?\n\n456\n00:24:05.649 --> 00:24:09.815\nSo, let me log off.\n\n457\n00:24:09.815 --> 00:24:13.630\nI don't know who I was logged on as,\nand now I'm gonna log on as Dan.\n\n458\n00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:18.640\nI'm logging into the main\non my domain machine.\n\n459\n00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:20.770\nI'm coming into work for the day.\n\n460\n00:24:20.770 --> 00:24:24.200\nI've been told or\nI want to install Office.\n\n461\n00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:27.190\nAnd my coworkers and\nI just go out to portal.office.com and\n\n462\n00:24:27.190 --> 00:24:28.426\nyou can install Office.\n\n463\n00:24:28.426 --> 00:24:33.661\nSo I'm just gonna launch up Edge,\nor whatever his browser choice is,\n\n464\n00:24:33.661 --> 00:24:37.135\nand we're gonna go to portal.office.com.\n\n465\n00:24:40.217 --> 00:24:41.984\nEdge is faster than both Chrome and\nFirefox.\n\n466\n00:24:41.984 --> 00:24:42.958\n&gt;&gt; That's just great.\n\n467\n00:24:42.958 --> 00:24:43.558\n&gt;&gt; Just in case.\n\n468\n00:24:43.558 --> 00:24:44.570\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n469\n00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:48.367\n&gt;&gt; All right, let's try a different\n\n470\n00:24:48.367 --> 00:24:49.140\npage here.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n471\n00:24:49.140 --> 00:24:49.763\n&gt;&gt; You see how fast it is?\n\n472\n00:24:49.763 --> 00:24:50.589\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna say, are you\n\n473\n00:24:50.589 --> 00:24:52.569\ngonna try it in a different browser, Mike?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n474\n00:24:52.569 --> 00:24:56.881\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Just kidding.\n\n475\n00:24:56.881 --> 00:24:58.385\n&gt;&gt; Here we go, all right.\n\n476\n00:24:58.385 --> 00:25:01.065\nSo Dan says, cool, I'm gonna log in.\n\n477\n00:25:01.065 --> 00:25:08.622\nDan@itprotvdemo.com You'll\ntype in his password.\n\n478\n00:25:10.376 --> 00:25:13.320\nOf course Dan is a good guy,\nand he won't save his password.\n\n479\n00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:15.352\nHe doesn't mind typing it in now and\nagain.\n\n480\n00:25:19.323 --> 00:25:21.790\nRight, and here we go.\n\n481\n00:25:21.790 --> 00:25:23.764\nHe's logged in, but he doesn't see a lot.\n\n482\n00:25:23.764 --> 00:25:27.430\nI see Store, and that's it, right?\n\n483\n00:25:27.430 --> 00:25:31.440\nAnd if I go to Install Office Apps,\nI can see Install Software.\n\n484\n00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:36.200\nAnd if I click on that,\nI get a whole lot of nothing.\n\n485\n00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:37.510\nPlease contact your Admin.\n\n486\n00:25:37.510 --> 00:25:40.430\nLooks like they haven't assigned\nyou a license, all right.\n\n487\n00:25:40.430 --> 00:25:43.490\nSo, let's assign a license.\n\n488\n00:25:43.490 --> 00:25:49.280\nOver here, I'm gonna tell him that, or\ntell Office, that Dan logs in from the US.\n\n489\n00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:50.360\nAnd you need to choose a reason.\n\n490\n00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:52.100\nIt will actually tell you over here,\n\n491\n00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:55.090\nsome products are different\nbased on your region.\n\n492\n00:25:55.090 --> 00:25:59.252\nSo it helps to tell them what region\nyour user, normally logs in from.\n\n493\n00:25:59.252 --> 00:26:02.610\nHe might travel and go to Europe for\nmeetings and things like that.\n\n494\n00:26:02.610 --> 00:26:05.086\nBut primarily he logs in in the US.\n\n495\n00:26:05.086 --> 00:26:09.147\nAnd I'm gonna give him Office 365\nBusiness, and once I turn that on,\n\n496\n00:26:09.147 --> 00:26:11.889\nyou'll see I have a few\ndifferent options here.\n\n497\n00:26:11.889 --> 00:26:18.510\nOffice 365, OneDrive, Office Online,\nSway, Forms, but this will change, right?\n\n498\n00:26:18.510 --> 00:26:22.350\nDepending on the level of subscription\nthat your organization has,\n\n499\n00:26:22.350 --> 00:26:24.340\nyou might see different options here.\n\n500\n00:26:24.340 --> 00:26:27.260\nI'm gonna go ahead and give him\nthe enterprise mobility and security.\n\n501\n00:26:27.260 --> 00:26:30.990\nThat's really a different episode, but\nwhile I'm here I will as well do that.\n\n502\n00:26:30.990 --> 00:26:37.890\nAnd I will go ahead and click save,\nand then close, and I'll close that.\n\n503\n00:26:37.890 --> 00:26:43.311\nAll right, now I'll back up the Dan's\nmachine [SOUND] that is the wrong machine.\n\n504\n00:26:43.311 --> 00:26:45.390\nGo back over to Dan's machine.\n\n505\n00:26:45.390 --> 00:26:47.680\nAnd Daniel was gonna click back.\n\n506\n00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:49.463\nSo he called the hub desk and\nsaid, hey, what's the deal?\n\n507\n00:26:49.463 --> 00:26:51.280\nI don't have any Office applications.\n\n508\n00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:53.190\nWhy can't I Install Office?\n\n509\n00:26:53.190 --> 00:26:54.850\nAnd they escalate it up.\n\n510\n00:26:54.850 --> 00:26:57.740\nThe admin goes and assigns Dan a license.\n\n511\n00:26:57.740 --> 00:27:02.590\nSo Dan comes back in here, and\ngoes back out to Office 365.\n\n512\n00:27:02.590 --> 00:27:06.980\nAnd then he's going to and\nit doesn't look like it has kicked in yet.\n\n513\n00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:08.070\n&gt;&gt; That's what I was going to ask.\n\n514\n00:27:08.070 --> 00:27:12.110\nBecause sometimes I've dealt with Cloud\nservices and it does take a little minute.\n\n515\n00:27:12.110 --> 00:27:16.860\nSo if Dan's on the phone you might\nhave some awkward silence there.\n\n516\n00:27:16.860 --> 00:27:18.500\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n517\n00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:22.763\nLet's try relaunching that browser and\nthen going back in,\n\n518\n00:27:22.763 --> 00:27:24.608\nhave it reauthenticate.\n\n519\n00:27:24.608 --> 00:27:25.984\nGo back to portal.office.com.\n\n520\n00:27:28.183 --> 00:27:33.080\nEnter in my password, and\nthat's not the right password for Daniel.\n\n521\n00:27:34.410 --> 00:27:35.548\nToo many different accounts in my head.\n&gt;&gt; As you said,\n\n522\n00:27:35.548 --> 00:27:37.034\nhow do you remember all of this?\n&gt;&gt; I do.\n\n523\n00:27:37.034 --> 00:27:37.684\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n524\n00:27:37.684 --> 00:27:39.037\n&gt;&gt; And they're not all the same,\n\n525\n00:27:39.037 --> 00:27:39.730\nI promise.\n\n526\n00:27:39.730 --> 00:27:41.355\nOkay, some of them are.\n\n527\n00:27:41.355 --> 00:27:46.856\nAnd it doesn't look like it has\nkicked in just yet, no, it has not.\n\n528\n00:27:46.856 --> 00:27:50.202\nAll right, probably what we will have to\ndo, I know we are getting short of time.\n\n529\n00:27:50.202 --> 00:27:53.270\nAnyway, Cherokee we'll give\nthat a few minutes to bake but\n\n530\n00:27:53.270 --> 00:27:58.290\nit is a good example if you guys\nare working with this troubleshooting and\n\n531\n00:27:58.290 --> 00:28:01.100\nyour admin calls and says,\nyep, I've updated it.\n\n532\n00:28:01.100 --> 00:28:02.730\nDaniel now has a license.\n\n533\n00:28:02.730 --> 00:28:06.060\nSo you tell Daniel to log in and try it\nout, and he says, nope, it hasn't changed.\n\n534\n00:28:06.060 --> 00:28:09.110\nMicrosoft will tell you,\ngive it ten minutes and come back.\n\n535\n00:28:09.110 --> 00:28:13.165\nCuz it takes a minute for everything to\nreplicate across there data centers for\n\n536\n00:28:13.165 --> 00:28:14.415\nall of that to kick in.\n\n537\n00:28:14.415 --> 00:28:17.845\nSo we will stop here, and\ncome back maybe with another part?\n\n538\n00:28:17.845 --> 00:28:19.440\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a great actual example.\n\n539\n00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:22.445\nBecause in real life we're not just\n\n540\n00:28:22.445 --> 00:28:24.895\nhaphazardly handing out\nall those licenses.\n\n541\n00:28:24.895 --> 00:28:26.435\nThat you guys really may encounter this.\n\n542\n00:28:26.435 --> 00:28:28.945\nGreat demo for that Mike.\n\n543\n00:28:28.945 --> 00:28:30.145\nAnd thank you so much for joining us.\n\n544\n00:28:30.145 --> 00:28:31.405\nBut for now let's sign out.\n\n545\n00:28:31.405 --> 00:28:33.665\nI've been your host, Cherokee Boose.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n546\n00:28:33.665 --> 00:28:36.762\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITVProTV.\n\n547\n00:28:36.762 --> 00:28:42.658\n[MUSIC]\n\n548\n00:28:42.658 --> 00:28:45.762\n&gt;&gt;

00:00:26.780\nBecause we're picking\nup here with a Part 2.\n\n11\n00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:31.920\nContinuing looking at ways we can support\nour Microsoft Store and cloud apps.\n\n12\n00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.420\nAnd, of course, we have Mr. Mike Rodrick\nback in studios with us today.\n\n13\n00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:36.391\nHow's it going, Mike?\n\n14\n00:00:36.391 --> 00:00:40.441\nGreat Cherokee, and yeah kind of dying to\nsee what happened with good old Dan and\n\n15\n00:00:40.441 --> 00:00:43.750\nwhether he got his office applications.\n&gt;&gt; Did he install his apps?\n\n16\n00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:44.340\n&gt;&gt; I know, so\n\n17\n00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.760\nif you remember from part one we had\nassigned a license to a user named Dan.\n\n18\n00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.030\nHe had logged into the portal\nbefore we assigned the license\n\n19\n00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.140\nno applications were available.\n\n20\n00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:55.810\nSo we went,\n\n21\n00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:00.620\nassigned a license, went back to the\nportal, still no applications available.\n\n22\n00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.480\nBut as I said, it's a time thing.\n\n23\n00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:03.640\nWe just have to be patient.\n\n24\n00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.340\nSo join me on my screen here.\n\n25\n00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:07.990\nAnd this is what I was telling you about.\n\n26\n00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:13.500\nMicrosoft will tell you if you just\ngot your license wait ten minutes and\n\n27\n00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.280\nrefresh the page and\neverything should be fine.\n\n28\n00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.340\nIf not, contact your IT department.\n\n29\n00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.600\nMaybe they didn't assign the proper\nlicense or the wrong account or\n\n30\n00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.570\nsomething like that.\n\n31\n00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:24.960\nSo let's see what happens\nif we refresh our page.\n\n32\n00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:27.860\nLike magic, there we go.\n\n33\n00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.900\nAll right, we'll close this little\ntour of Office 365 for now.\n\n34\n00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.994\nAnd now, you can see that Daniel has\naccess to Word, and Excel, and PowerPoint\n\n35\n00:01:36.994 --> 00:01:41.680\nand OneNote, as these are the apps my\norganization has chosen to make available.\n\n36\n00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.390\nIf he wants to run one of these,\nhe can simply click Word.\n\n37\n00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.940\nAnd it's gonna open up\nright here in a browser.\n\n38\n00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:52.200\nBecause this is the first time I launched\nit, I get a couple of intro pages.\n\n39\n00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.220\nBut I can simply open up\na new blank document and\n\n40\n00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.720\nbegin working with Word Online, right.\n\n41\n00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.630\nSo easy, breezy there.\n\n42\n00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.000\nBut that does mean I would need\naccess to the internet, right.\n\n43\n00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.160\nBecause this is running\nout there in the cloud.\n\n44\n00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.780\nWhat if I want to install\nthem locally on my system?\n\n45\n00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:10.470\nAnd then he says hey, look.\n\n46\n00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.930\nThere's times I need to use Word and\nI don't have internet access.\n\n47\n00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.680\nI'm travelling,\nI'm in airports where there's limited or\n\n48\n00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.330\nno coverage, so\nI'd like the desktop version.\n\n49\n00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:22.890\nWell we don't have to go get the ISO,\n\n50\n00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.780\nwe don't have to install it in\nthis machine the old school way,\n\n51\n00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.980\nhe can simply go to the cloud and\nwhen he does have internet access.\n\n52\n00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.414\nAnd choose to install the office apps,\n\n53\n00:02:31.414 --> 00:02:36.220\nright I've got Office 2016 right here and\nother installation options.\n\n54\n00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.340\nThe other options,\nif you wanted to pick a language,\n\n55\n00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.100\nother than the one he's configured for,\nit's all based on memory set.\n\n56\n00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:47.550\nWe assign him a license in part one,\nand I chose United States, so\n\n57\n00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:48.728\nit knows language 64.\n\n58\n00:02:48.728 --> 00:02:52.670\nIf you wanna do the 64 bit version,\nthe default is 32 bit.\n\n59\n00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.520\nYou can click on the other\ninstall options, or\n\n60\n00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.530\nyou can simply choose\nto install Office 2016.\n\n61\n00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.895\nIt's gonna show me to,\nor tell me to click Run.\n\n62\n00:03:05.589 --> 00:03:09.110\nAnd then enter in my credentials.\n\n63\n00:03:11.162 --> 00:03:17.850\nAnd he needs an admin account\nto install this, On the machine.\n\n64\n00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.400\nI'll just add my admin account there.\n\n65\n00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:28.860\nAnd then, we don't need to watch\nthe install process I suppose,\n\n66\n00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.990\nbut it will install Office, all right?\n\n67\n00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:37.390\nSo next thing I wanna show you with this,\nlet me see if I can tell you what I'll do.\n\n68\n00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:39.780\nLet me show you mine.\n\n69\n00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:44.050\nI am going to log into actually I'm\nalready here, portal.office.com,\n\n70\n00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:45.610\nI'm gonna go back out to home.\n\n71\n00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:49.770\nRemember this is where we\nset the licence for Daniel.\n\n72\n00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.680\nBut while his account is getting set\nup not all the options are there, so\n\n73\n00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.610\nI switch over to this account so\nI can show you some of the other options.\n\n74\n00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:02.670\nOnce he gets everything installed,\na couple things that he can do.\n\n75\n00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:09.100\nOne, that license covers, that's I'm\ngonna say, up to five devices, so Daniel,\n\n76\n00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:14.020\nonce I give him that license, could\ninstall Office on up to five devices.\n\n77\n00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:18.070\nAnd if I go into,\nlet's see where I wanna go here.\n\n78\n00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:26.090\nKinda clicked on the wrong thing there,\nmy settings that's where it is.\n\n79\n00:04:27.204 --> 00:04:32.295\nNope, I lied where is that option?\n&gt;&gt; For\n\n80\n00:04:32.295 --> 00:04:34.600\nwhich one?\n&gt;&gt; I wanted to show the,\n\n81\n00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.730\nthere it is let me go back and\ndo that again.\n\n82\n00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.750\nSo I went to install Office apps and\n\n83\n00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:43.720\nthen other install options we\nwere just talking about that.\n\n84\n00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:45.270\nThat opens up another tab.\n\n85\n00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:48.900\nAnd I can see the other\noptions that I have.\n\n86\n00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.450\nIf I wanted to install\na different language or\n\n87\n00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:54.520\nthe 64 bit version,\nI can change that here.\n\n88\n00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:01.400\nWhich I don't, but I wanted to show you,\nClick back on this guy.\n\n89\n00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:06.140\nTo get into the settings that\nis really convoluted is it not.\n\n90\n00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:08.640\n&gt;&gt; There are a lot of\n\n91\n00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:13.360\nin the online interfaces, sometimes\nyou really have to hunt for things.\n\n92\n00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:14.080\n&gt;&gt; I tell you what, so\n\n93\n00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.750\nhere I am in the portal.office.com right,\nlogged in like any user.\n\n94\n00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:21.150\nI click Settings here and\nI get these settings.\n\n95\n00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:23.450\nThere's your app settings, Office 365.\n\n96\n00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:25.480\nThat's the one I wanted.\n\n97\n00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:26.960\nWas that behind my head?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n98\n00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:27.610\n&gt;&gt; Let me do that again.\n\n99\n00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:31.840\nCuz I really went the long way the first\ntime, and that was a little confusing.\n\n100\n00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:37.100\nSo from the Office 365 portal main\nscreen they can click on the gear icon,\n\n101\n00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:40.790\nand down towards the bottom I've\ngot your app settings, Office 365.\n\n102\n00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:42.440\nClick on that.\n\n103\n00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:51.353\nThat brings me out, well eventually,\nI've made it mad now cuz I opened and\n\n104\n00:05:51.353 --> 00:05:56.500\nclosed it in rapid succession.\n&gt;&gt; I dare you [LAUGH].\n\n105\n00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:58.120\n&gt;&gt; I tell you what, thank you Microsoft.\n\n106\n00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:59.870\nThis makes a great show.\n\n107\n00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:02.390\nCome on, let's try that again.\n\n108\n00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:03.330\nSettings, Office365.\n\n109\n00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:07.650\nThere we go,\nthis is what I was trying to get into.\n\n110\n00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:14.770\nAnd from here I can see this software\ninstallation or software option and\n\n111\n00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:18.480\nI have this install status this is\nwhat I really wanted to show you.\n\n112\n00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:22.040\nIt shows you how many\ninstalls you have and\n\n113\n00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:24.965\nI can choose to install desktop\napplications from here.\n\n114\n00:06:24.965 --> 00:06:26.860\nAnd it takes me back out\nto that same screen.\n\n115\n00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:29.900\nSo what I was really trying\nto show you is if your\n\n116\n00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:34.370\nuser is trying to install office and it\ntells them that they cannot, that they're\n\n117\n00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:39.670\nalready installed it across four or five\ndevices, it limits them to five installs.\n\n118\n00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:43.070\nAnd what can happen is that I\nmight install this on a laptop\n\n119\n00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:43.930\nthat I don't own anymore.\n\n120\n00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:46.300\nI got rid of it, I formatted it,\nI got rid of it.\n\n121\n00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:48.470\nMaybe I put it on an IOS device.\n\n122\n00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:49.910\nAnd I don't have that device anymore.\n\n123\n00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:52.880\nSo I just want to show you\nhow to deal with that.\n\n124\n00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:55.720\nAnd you can come in here,\nto install status.\n\n125\n00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:57.930\nI thought I had some installs,\nbut I do not.\n\n126\n00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:01.180\nBut it would show me the different\ninstalls in the machines that it was\n\n127\n00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:02.330\ninstalled on.\n\n128\n00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:06.640\nAnd I can remove that if I didn't\nown that laptop anymore, or\n\n129\n00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:08.560\nI didn't want Office\ninstalled on that one.\n\n130\n00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:12.240\nI really need it on this laptop so\nI'm gonna take it off of my home computer.\n\n131\n00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:16.900\nYou can flip around here which machines\nyou actually have Office installed on.\n\n132\n00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:18.180\n&gt;&gt; So you're really just revoking or\n\n133\n00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:22.480\ndisassociating that licensed\nwith that individual device.\n\n134\n00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:24.280\n&gt;&gt; Exactly right, so\n\n135\n00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:27.542\nthis is where you would\nsee that install status.\n\n136\n00:07:27.542 --> 00:07:30.340\nAll right,\nlet's go back over to Daniel's machine and\n\n137\n00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:33.970\nsee if it's, it's still chugging along.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n138\n00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:35.359\nyou've got a lot going there.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n139\n00:07:35.359 --> 00:07:37.355\n&gt;&gt; He's getting the whole little package.\n\n140\n00:07:37.355 --> 00:07:39.490\n&gt;&gt; Getting the whole darn suite, aren't I?\n\n141\n00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:40.772\nI like it.\n\n142\n00:07:40.772 --> 00:07:44.000\nAll right, while that's going nuts to\nnothing too terribly exciting there again\n\n143\n00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.060\nfor the exam, it's more about\nunderstanding the process, right?\n\n144\n00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:52.303\nMicrosoft Office 365 is their\ncloud-based Office product.\n\n145\n00:07:52.303 --> 00:07:55.883\nIt's subscription-based, so\nmy organization needs a subscription.\n\n146\n00:07:55.883 --> 00:07:59.521\nAnd talking about troubleshooting,\nthings we can run into.\n\n147\n00:07:59.521 --> 00:08:05.020\nFor a user, is, if they can't\ninstall one of these applications.\n\n148\n00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:06.610\nIt's because they forgot their password.\n\n149\n00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:11.350\nThey didn't log in to portal.office.com\nand they maybe don't know their password,\n\n150\n00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:15.560\nor they've logged in, but\nthey haven't been assigned a license.\n\n151\n00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:18.410\nSo, that's one of the things we\nwould have to troubleshooter, or\n\n152\n00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:21.330\nthey've already installed it on\nmore five devices, or five devices.\n\n153\n00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:25.340\nThat is the limit and we would need to\nuninstall it from one of those devices\n\n154\n00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:29.210\nto free up one of those licenses\nto allow them to install it on\n\n155\n00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:32.010\na different device.\n&gt;&gt; I can't wait to tell Dan you said he\n\n156\n00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:33.128\nhad the full package.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n157\n00:08:33.128 --> 00:08:34.897\n&gt;&gt; I know right?\n\n158\n00:08:34.897 --> 00:08:36.950\nI better revoke that license\nbefore you tell him.\n\n159\n00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:40.890\nAll right, let's see what is next.\n\n160\n00:08:40.890 --> 00:08:41.970\nWe talked about Office 365.\n\n161\n00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:43.960\nI've got a little bit of time.\n\n162\n00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:46.540\nWhat do we have?\nLet's talk about the Microsoft store\n\n163\n00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:48.140\nnext, all right.\n\n164\n00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:51.100\nI know exciting times here.\n&gt;&gt; Shocking.\n\n165\n00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:51.710\n&gt;&gt; Tell you what.\n\n166\n00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:53.670\nI'm trying to figure out,\nI'm kind of stuck.\n\n167\n00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:56.210\nYou know what,\nI'm gonna cancel this install,\n\n168\n00:08:57.210 --> 00:09:00.140\nI think it will actually keep\ninstalling while I do this.\n\n169\n00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:00.960\nYeah, it should be good.\n\n170\n00:09:02.538 --> 00:09:07.090\nAll right so, we'll just let that\nrun in the background there and\n\n171\n00:09:07.090 --> 00:09:09.480\nwe will keep on trucking.\n\n172\n00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:13.730\nAlright so the Microsoft store\nis where Microsoft makes their\n\n173\n00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:16.530\nWindows 10 apps available, right?\n\n174\n00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:19.430\nIt's an online store, much like some of\n\n175\n00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:22.500\nthe other big organizations\nthat have those online stores.\n\n176\n00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:27.180\nGoogle has theirs,\nyeah the Google Play Store.\n\n177\n00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:28.690\nThe Apple Store, things like that.\n\n178\n00:09:28.690 --> 00:09:34.270\nWe've got the Microsoft Store where I\ncan get apps for my Windows 10 devices.\n\n179\n00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:41.300\nAnd wow, it's really going slow, I tell\nyou what, let's, let me close that for\n\n180\n00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:45.020\na minute, lets give Office a minute\nto finish that install process and\n\n181\n00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:47.470\nthen we'll come back when things\nare running a little bit smoother.\n\n182\n00:09:49.270 --> 00:09:51.360\nAll right, so I think Office is finished,\n\n183\n00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:53.470\nmy machine should be\na little more responsive.\n\n184\n00:09:53.470 --> 00:09:55.915\nThis virtual machine I'm using\ndoesn't have a lot of resources,\n\n185\n00:09:55.915 --> 00:09:59.480\nnormally the Office install doesn't\ntie up your entire machine but\n\n186\n00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:00.150\nshould be good to go know.\n\n187\n00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:01.780\nSo join me back here if you will.\n\n188\n00:10:01.780 --> 00:10:04.510\nIt says you're all set\nOffice is in installed now.\n\n189\n00:10:04.510 --> 00:10:06.410\nI'll click close.\n\n190\n00:10:06.410 --> 00:10:12.540\nIf I go to my Start menu, I should see\nI have Excel, and I can type in Word.\n\n191\n00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:16.350\nAnd I should be able to launch Word,\nthere it is.\n\n192\n00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:20.090\nAnd of course the first time I launch it,\n\n193\n00:10:20.090 --> 00:10:22.830\nit's gonna give me a little tour.\n&gt;&gt; So,\n\n194\n00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:26.770\nyou're actually,\nlaunching the application, or\n\n195\n00:10:26.770 --> 00:10:31.240\nthe app, that is residing on this physical\nmachine regardless if you have internet\n\n196\n00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:32.320\nconnection or not.\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n\n197\n00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:36.060\nThis is the locally installed\nversion of were 2016.\n\n198\n00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:41.080\nSo there is that, there,\nas I knew it was gonna pop up.\n\n199\n00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:42.540\nI agree to that.\n\n200\n00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:44.810\nNow everything should\nlaunch a little bit faster.\n\n201\n00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:46.180\nAll right there's word.\n\n202\n00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:49.140\nSo now he has it locally, so\nagain it's exactly like you said,\n\n203\n00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:53.450\nif he doesn't have internet access you\ncan still work with those applications.\n\n204\n00:10:53.450 --> 00:10:55.310\nNow let's go back out to\nthe portal real quick, and\n\n205\n00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:57.690\njust check what happened out there.\n\n206\n00:10:57.690 --> 00:11:00.309\nWe go to portal.office.com.\n\n207\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:04.662\nI'll log in with my user account.\n\n208\n00:11:11.733 --> 00:11:16.613\nAnd now we're gonna go to our settings and\nthen Office 365 settings,\n\n209\n00:11:16.613 --> 00:11:22.570\njust right behind my head there,\nit's okay you guys have seen that before.\n\n210\n00:11:22.570 --> 00:11:27.390\nAnd then install status and there now\nI can show you what that looks like,\n\n211\n00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:29.880\nso I can see it detected one install,\n\n212\n00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:33.480\ntells me the name of that machine,\ngoing to hit this little drop down,\n\n213\n00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:35.850\nget a little more information\nas far as when it was installed.\n\n214\n00:11:35.850 --> 00:11:39.910\nAnd if I decided that I needed to free up\none of my installs for a different device,\n\n215\n00:11:39.910 --> 00:11:45.750\nthis is where I would go to deactivate\nthis particular machine, right?\n\n216\n00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:48.780\nSo, again, thinking about troubleshooting,\nwhat kind of things,\n\n217\n00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:51.660\nwhat kind of problems\nare the users going to run into?\n\n218\n00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:53.310\nThis would be one of them, right?\n\n219\n00:11:53.310 --> 00:11:56.070\nThey don't have a license we already\ntalked about that but they've already\n\n220\n00:11:56.070 --> 00:12:00.902\ninstalled them on five devices and so\nthey're not allowed to install it again.\n\n221\n00:12:00.902 --> 00:12:04.790\nAll right so\nthat's where we would go to change that.\n\n222\n00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:07.570\nAlright now we're going to get back to\nthe store because that's where we left\n\n223\n00:12:07.570 --> 00:12:11.610\noff except Office install was kind\nof plugging up my machine there.\n\n224\n00:12:11.610 --> 00:12:17.400\nSo the store, the Microsoft store,\nfor their apps.\n\n225\n00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:22.750\nAnd so if we click on the little store\nicon, it whirs and grinds for a second.\n\n226\n00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:27.130\nThinking about it and\ntakes me out to the Microsoft store.\n\n227\n00:12:27.130 --> 00:12:27.950\nWhere we can go and\n\n228\n00:12:27.950 --> 00:12:33.250\nperuse all of the fantastic applications\nthat is available through the library.\n\n229\n00:12:33.250 --> 00:12:37.250\nNow one of the things that we've\nsaid this in a few episodes,\n\n230\n00:12:37.250 --> 00:12:39.670\nthings are changing really\nfast with Windows 10.\n\n231\n00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:44.110\nAnd it used to be that you had\nto have a Microsoft account\n\n232\n00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:47.280\nto get access to the Microsoft store.\n\n233\n00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:50.460\nWell, I'm currently logged\non with a domain account.\n\n234\n00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:52.530\nIt is not a Microsoft account.\n\n235\n00:12:52.530 --> 00:12:54.200\nAnd you can see, one,\nI'm in the store, right?\n\n236\n00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:57.261\nIf I go up here, I am not logged in, okay.\n\n237\n00:12:57.261 --> 00:13:01.150\nBut [INAUDIBLE] find an application.\n\n238\n00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:03.870\nWhat's a nice free quick and\neasy one, Spotify there we go.\n\n239\n00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:05.550\nSo we have that one.\n\n240\n00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:09.320\nNot promoting any one of these particular\napps just want to try a free one.\n\n241\n00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:12.410\nI click Get and it tells me,\n\n242\n00:13:12.410 --> 00:13:17.320\nhey sign in with Microsoft to use\nthis on any compatible device.\n\n243\n00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:21.120\nSo there are advantages, as I said earlier\nto associated to Microsoft account,\n\n244\n00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:23.980\nor using a Microsoft account,\nthis is one of them.\n\n245\n00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:29.380\nI can actually run this app, free ones,\ndoesn't really matter, they're free.\n\n246\n00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:32.490\nBut even if it was a paid app,\nup to 10 devices,\n\n247\n00:13:32.490 --> 00:13:37.570\nI could use this application Pay for it\nonce, I can install it across ten devices.\n\n248\n00:13:37.570 --> 00:13:39.040\nIf I'm signing with a Microsoft account.\n\n249\n00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:41.890\nIf not, they have no way of\ntracking that I purchased it and\n\n250\n00:13:41.890 --> 00:13:43.560\nI don't get that same feature.\n\n251\n00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:44.770\nSo it wants me to sign in.\n\n252\n00:13:44.770 --> 00:13:46.180\nBut I'm just going to chose no thanks.\n\n253\n00:13:47.470 --> 00:13:51.650\nAnd you'll see that it starts the download\nand everything is going to download fine.\n\n254\n00:13:51.650 --> 00:13:55.290\nEven though I'm not signed\nin with a Microsoft account.\n\n255\n00:13:56.330 --> 00:13:57.760\n&gt;&gt; That reminds me, I need to try Spotify.\n\n256\n00:13:57.760 --> 00:13:58.930\nI have Pandora and\n\n257\n00:13:58.930 --> 00:14:00.720\neveryone tells me Spotify is better.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n258\n00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:02.910\nwhat is Spotify?\n&gt;&gt; It's like a music streaming\n\n259\n00:14:02.910 --> 00:14:03.851\napp.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n260\n00:14:03.851 --> 00:14:04.400\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I'm so\n\n261\n00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:09.050\nbad, it shows you how\nup with the times I am.\n\n262\n00:14:09.050 --> 00:14:10.840\nAll right, let's try,\nI did wanna try something,\n\n263\n00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:13.710\nCherokee and I were talking earlier\nabout the fact that you don't have to\n\n264\n00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:16.730\nhave a Microsoft account now to\nget an app out of the store.\n\n265\n00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:19.390\nWondered if maybe it was\nbecause it was free.\n\n266\n00:14:19.390 --> 00:14:21.480\nSo I thought I'd find us a paid app.\n\n267\n00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:29.890\nHere's one and I can buy or\ndo a free trial.\n\n268\n00:14:29.890 --> 00:14:34.880\nWhen I click Buy, it's definitely\ngoing to force me to login, right?\n\n269\n00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:39.820\nSo that is really what I\nwanted to show you there.\n\n270\n00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:41.370\nWhen you're setting up for this exam.\n\n271\n00:14:41.370 --> 00:14:44.560\nA lot of the documentation says you\nhave to have a Microsoft account.\n\n272\n00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:47.970\nYou do if you wanna buy anything\nthrough the store, if it's a free app,\n\n273\n00:14:47.970 --> 00:14:52.060\nyou can now get it, even if you\ndon't have a Microsoft account.\n\n274\n00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:53.620\nBut, that's the Microsoft Store.\n\n275\n00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:55.960\nAgain, a great little repository for\n\n276\n00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:59.680\nall of the applications that Microsoft\nmakes available through their store.\n\n277\n00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:04.430\nThey also call out the Microsoft Store for\nbusiness and the Microsoft Store for\n\n278\n00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:05.620\neducation.\n\n279\n00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:08.870\nBefore I do that though, I did want to\nshow you one more thing with the store.\n\n280\n00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:13.511\nAs a enterprise you might not want your\nusers downloading apps from the store,\n\n281\n00:15:13.511 --> 00:15:18.218\nI don't need them getting Mahjong, or\nSpotify, or any of these other things on\n\n282\n00:15:18.218 --> 00:15:21.030\nmy domain machines.\n&gt;&gt; Bandwidth is precious right?\n\n283\n00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:21.670\n&gt;&gt; I know, so\n\n284\n00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:25.690\nmaybe I want to block that and\nwe most certainly can.\n\n285\n00:15:25.690 --> 00:15:28.690\nThrough group policy,\nagain this is a server side thing.\n\n286\n00:15:28.690 --> 00:15:32.100\nBut your users, for this exam,\nthinking trouble shooting,\n\n287\n00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:33.920\nconfiguring working with Windows.\n\n288\n00:15:34.990 --> 00:15:37.060\nUser comes to me and says, hey I can\n\n289\n00:15:37.060 --> 00:15:40.261\nnot install this app from the store.\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] Why not?\n\n290\n00:15:40.261 --> 00:15:41.069\n&gt;&gt; Because it might not really\n\n291\n00:15:41.069 --> 00:15:41.670\nbe an error.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n292\n00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:42.470\nAnd it's not an error.\n\n293\n00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:45.000\nIt's because your enterprise\nhas blocked that, right.\n\n294\n00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:50.080\nSo, if you take a look in group policy,\nI'm just gonna pick my default name.\n\n295\n00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:51.040\nI'll pause it here real quick.\n\n296\n00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:53.308\nAnd you don't have to memorize\nwhere this setting is.\n\n297\n00:15:53.308 --> 00:15:53.932\n&gt;&gt; I ws gonna say,\n\n298\n00:15:53.932 --> 00:15:56.201\nI bet you have this one memorized, too.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n299\n00:15:56.201 --> 00:16:01.648\nBut you do't have to be as geeky as that\nat least for this exam, others, you might.\n\n300\n00:16:01.648 --> 00:16:05.810\nThe main thing is understand that access\nto the store can be blocked through\n\n301\n00:16:05.810 --> 00:16:07.340\ngroup policy, all right?\n\n302\n00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:11.470\nSo I can go into administrative templates,\nWindows components, and\n\n303\n00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:14.060\nthen down to store.\n\n304\n00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:22.700\nAnd the option right here, turn disable\nall apps from the Windows Store,\n\n305\n00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:27.170\nwait those are the ones for pre,\nyour store will also be disabled.\n\n306\n00:16:27.170 --> 00:16:28.600\nSo that's the one right there.\n\n307\n00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:30.760\nYou can see there's several options here.\n\n308\n00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:32.870\nAgain this exam is not\ngonna quiz you on that.\n\n309\n00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:37.010\nThe main one I want to show you is\ndisable all apps from the Windows Store,\n\n310\n00:16:37.010 --> 00:16:39.200\nturn off the store application,\n\n311\n00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:44.220\nthis will also prevent them from\naccessing the Microsoft store, okay?\n\n312\n00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:47.990\nNow, one other thing we need to talk\nabout with these Windows applications,\n\n313\n00:16:47.990 --> 00:16:53.450\nthese universal platform applications,\nyou can create your own.\n\n314\n00:16:54.940 --> 00:17:00.370\nAs an organization, we can write our\nown universal Windows application and\n\n315\n00:17:00.370 --> 00:17:03.350\nwe can make it available\nthrough the Windows Store.\n\n316\n00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:05.640\nWe have to go through a process\nof submitting that and\n\n317\n00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:09.360\ngiving it to Microsoft and letting them\nmake it available in the Windows Store.\n\n318\n00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:13.090\nAnd it would be available to our users,\nand everybody else.\n\n319\n00:17:13.090 --> 00:17:16.150\nMaybe we wanna make money with this app or\nsomething like that, right?\n\n320\n00:17:16.150 --> 00:17:20.370\nOr it's a free app like our ITPro TV.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah it's actually pretty cool,\n\n321\n00:17:20.370 --> 00:17:23.840\nI stumbled across some developer\nvideos that Microsoft had put out,\n\n322\n00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:27.130\nwell videos for developers explaining.\n\n323\n00:17:27.130 --> 00:17:30.554\nI was trying to understand all\nthe different features for\n\n324\n00:17:30.554 --> 00:17:36.280\nour accessibility options, but they even\nput out videos for developers to help\n\n325\n00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:42.390\nthem code in to being compliant\nwith their accessibility options.\n\n326\n00:17:42.390 --> 00:17:46.100\nBecause over the years we see these\nupdates and these changes happening, but\n\n327\n00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:48.415\nit's really cool with\nthis universal platform.\n\n328\n00:17:48.415 --> 00:17:50.090\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, absolutely.\n\n329\n00:17:50.090 --> 00:17:54.700\nAnd if your company writes an application\nand makes it available through the store,\n\n330\n00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:57.970\nmakes it very easy for\nyour users to install.\n\n331\n00:17:57.970 --> 00:18:02.150\nI don't have to go find the media,\ndistribute it that way.\n\n332\n00:18:02.150 --> 00:18:04.040\nI can just say,\nhey browse through the store,\n\n333\n00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:08.120\nhere's the name of the app you're gonna go\nfind and you can download it from there.\n\n334\n00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:12.450\nBut the thing to remember is if I do that\nroute, it's also available to anybody that\n\n335\n00:18:12.450 --> 00:18:15.900\ngoes to that Microsoft store and\nthat might not be what I want.\n\n336\n00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:20.820\nThis might be an internal type application\nthat I've written that I want my users to\n\n337\n00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:24.110\nhave access to, but\nnot the general public.\n\n338\n00:18:24.110 --> 00:18:28.731\nIn this case, we would want to submit it\nto the Microsoft Store for business or\n\n339\n00:18:28.731 --> 00:18:32.928\nif you're an educational department,\nor an educational facility,\n\n340\n00:18:32.928 --> 00:18:37.338\nyou can use the Microsoft Store for\neducation, if you're a university or\n\n341\n00:18:37.338 --> 00:18:38.712\nsomething like that.\n\n342\n00:18:38.712 --> 00:18:42.939\nBut this is something I can't really\nshow you because I don't have\n\n343\n00:18:42.939 --> 00:18:47.866\na Microsoft Store for business, or\nMicrosoft Store for education license.\n\n344\n00:18:47.866 --> 00:18:51.640\nSo I can't get access to that, but\nI want you to understand that it's there.\n\n345\n00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:56.514\nIf we go out here and we take a look at,\nI can just do a quick search,\n\n346\n00:18:56.514 --> 00:18:58.922\nMicrosoft Store for Business.\n\n347\n00:19:03.579 --> 00:19:06.466\nAnd let's see, there it is,\n\n348\n00:19:06.466 --> 00:19:11.350\nbusinessstore.microsoft.com/enusstore.\n\n349\n00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:17.000\nWhat you do is your organization\nwould have set this up.\n\n350\n00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:20.520\nAnd then your users could log in and\nwhen they logged in,\n\n351\n00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:21.590\nit's not gonna let me log in,\n\n352\n00:19:21.590 --> 00:19:25.310\nI'll go through the process, but it's not\ngonna let me cuz we haven't set this up.\n\n353\n00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:33.770\nMy organization does not have a business\nstore page, say that, there we go.\n\n354\n00:19:33.770 --> 00:19:37.390\nSays I don't have permission to access\nthe Microsoft Store for Business.\n\n355\n00:19:37.390 --> 00:19:39.740\nBut for\nthe exam what we're studying here or\n\n356\n00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:42.490\nwhat we're learning here\nis that as an organization,\n\n357\n00:19:42.490 --> 00:19:47.430\nI can make apps available through the\nstore, but only to my organization, right?\n\n358\n00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:51.720\nIt's not gonna go to the general public,\nso if it's an application that I've\n\n359\n00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:56.339\nwritten for internal use, there maybe is\na number cruncher or something like that.\n\n360\n00:19:56.339 --> 00:19:58.954\nBut the general public\ndoesn't need access to,\n\n361\n00:19:58.954 --> 00:20:01.969\nthen I can still make it\navailable through this method.\n\n362\n00:20:01.969 --> 00:20:04.960\nAnd then there's the Microsoft Store for\nEducation.\n\n363\n00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:08.637\nIf we are an educational\nfacility that we can use as well.\n\n364\n00:20:09.910 --> 00:20:14.440\nAll right, last thing I wanna show you in\nthis Microsoft Store is doing updates for\n\n365\n00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:15.500\nthose applications.\n\n366\n00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:19.000\nAnd for that, I'm actually gonna switch\nover to my physical machine because I\n\n367\n00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:23.680\nprobably have some updates that I can do.\n&gt;&gt; Multitasking, Mike.\n\n368\n00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:26.654\n&gt;&gt; Let's see, yeah, so let me back up here\n\n369\n00:20:26.654 --> 00:20:33.470\nand pull up the Microsoft There we go.\n\n370\n00:20:33.470 --> 00:20:37.857\nAll right, so again,\nI just navigated to that Microsoft,\n\n371\n00:20:37.857 --> 00:20:42.964\nI unpinned the icon from my I rarely\nuse this, but I've unpinned it.\n\n372\n00:20:42.964 --> 00:20:48.155\nBut Windows apps like this also need\nupdates just like any other application.\n\n373\n00:20:48.155 --> 00:20:51.636\nYou can get those updates automatically,\nbut I wanna make sure you see\n\n374\n00:20:51.636 --> 00:20:54.303\nhow to go about that.\n&gt;&gt; Cooking\n\n375\n00:20:54.303 --> 00:20:55.164\nfever.\n&gt;&gt; What's that?\n\n376\n00:20:55.164 --> 00:20:56.420\n&gt;&gt; Cooking fever.\n\n377\n00:20:56.420 --> 00:20:58.030\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, looks like a good one right?\n\n378\n00:20:58.030 --> 00:21:01.130\nHere I am, at the Microsoft Store.\n\n379\n00:21:01.130 --> 00:21:04.970\nOver here, up next to my icon for\nmy profile, I’ve got some little ellipsis\n\n380\n00:21:04.970 --> 00:21:09.650\ndots, and if I click on that I\ncan see downloads and updates.\n\n381\n00:21:09.650 --> 00:21:10.590\nClick on that.\n\n382\n00:21:10.590 --> 00:21:13.920\nIt'll show me all of the different\napps I have downloaded.\n\n383\n00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:17.390\nMost of which, don't judge me,\nthese were automatically downloaded\n\n384\n00:21:17.390 --> 00:21:19.977\nas part of the Windows 10-\n&gt;&gt; I don't have\n\n385\n00:21:19.977 --> 00:21:22.607\nCandy Crush!\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I was gonna say, I don't think\n\n386\n00:21:22.607 --> 00:21:25.731\nI've ever downloaded Candy Crush Saga.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n387\n00:21:25.731 --> 00:21:28.560\n&gt;&gt; But, the point is I can come in here,\n\n388\n00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:32.900\nI can select an individual app and\nI can get a little more details on it.\n\n389\n00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:35.110\nWe can go back to that screen.\n\n390\n00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:37.020\nHere I've got get updates.\n\n391\n00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:40.645\nIf I click get updates, it'll look at the\napps that I have installed on my machine.\n\n392\n00:21:40.645 --> 00:21:42.625\nIt'll let me know if\nthere are any updates.\n\n393\n00:21:42.625 --> 00:21:44.905\nWe'll just give it a second,\nand there we go.\n\n394\n00:21:44.905 --> 00:21:49.080\nI see mail and calendar,\ndoes indeed have an update.\n\n395\n00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:53.720\nSo just understand this is a separate\nprocess from doing Windows updates.\n\n396\n00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:58.090\nYou're not getting your apps updated\nthrough your Windows update process, so\n\n397\n00:21:58.090 --> 00:22:03.430\nyou're gonna have to go the store and\ndo the updates this way, and there we go.\n\n398\n00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:04.960\nWe are done with.\n&gt;&gt; I feel guilty.\n\n399\n00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:09.860\nI feel I need to check my app updates now.\n&gt;&gt; You\n\n400\n00:22:09.860 --> 00:22:11.940\nmight have an update waiting out there.\n\n401\n00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:16.910\nSo there you go,\nwe looked at using Microsoft\n\n402\n00:22:16.910 --> 00:22:21.970\naccounts with Office 365 and\nworking with the Microsoft Store.\n\n403\n00:22:21.970 --> 00:22:24.640\nWe got a little bit more to do but\nwe're getting short on time,\n\n404\n00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:28.530\ndon't think enough to get in to\nthe whole side loading apps.\n\n405\n00:22:28.530 --> 00:22:31.030\nThat's going to be next,\nso come back for that one.\n\n406\n00:22:31.030 --> 00:22:31.740\n&gt;&gt; Well, great, thank you for\n\n407\n00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:34.260\nyour time today, Mike, and thank you for\nyour time as well, but for\n\n408\n00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:37.610\nnow let's go ahead and sign out.\n&gt;&gt; I've been your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n409\n00:22:37.610 --> 00:22:38.432\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n410\n00:22:38.432 --> 00:22:41.637\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here on ITPro TV.\n\n411\n00:22:41.637 --> 00:22:47.199\n[MUSIC]\n\n412\n00:22:47.199 --> 00:22:50.880\n&gt;&gt; Thank you

00:00:07.466\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:07.466 --> 00:00:12.390\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n&gt;&gt; Welcome\n\n5\n00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:14.920\neveryone to your\nConfigure Windows Devices series,\n\n6\n00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:19.340\nstudying for that 70-697 exam,\nI'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:21.339\nWe're actually here in the Part 3,\n\n8\n00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:25.155\ntaking a look at how we can support\nour Microsoft store and cloud apps.\n\n9\n00:00:25.155 --> 00:00:29.275\nAnd of course, we brought Mike Rodric\nback in studios today to go ahead and\n\n10\n00:00:29.275 --> 00:00:30.212\nwrap things up.\n\n11\n00:00:30.212 --> 00:00:32.680\nMike, what are we gonna be\nlooking at in this show.\n\n12\n00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.430\n&gt;&gt; Well, today we're gonna take a look at\n\n13\n00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:36.910\nsomething known as side\nloading application,\n\n14\n00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:37.590\nall right?\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n15\n00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:38.960\n&gt;&gt; We've talked about different ways\n\n16\n00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.890\nwe can install Windows apps.\n\n17\n00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.170\nThese are app bundles or app packages,\nnot our standard desktop apps,\n\n18\n00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.780\nbut apps that are available through\nthe Microsoft Store, right?\n\n19\n00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.400\nDeveloped on that\nWindows Universal Platform.\n\n20\n00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:55.297\nWe also talked about how there's\na Microsoft Store for business, and\n\n21\n00:00:55.297 --> 00:00:57.540\na Microsoft Store for education.\n\n22\n00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:02.460\nSo if I write a custom in-house app,\nand I wanted make it available, but\n\n23\n00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.940\nnot to the general public, I could use\nthe Microsoft Store for business or\n\n24\n00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:07.860\nthe Microsoft Store for\neducation to make those available.\n\n25\n00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.998\nAnd people could, my users could browse,\nthey can sign in with their organization\n\n26\n00:01:11.998 --> 00:01:14.610\naccount, and\nthey can access those applications.\n\n27\n00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.642\nWe can also install them locally,\nwithout having to go out of the cloud or\n\n28\n00:01:19.642 --> 00:01:23.440\nout of the Internet and\ndownloading it from there.\n\n29\n00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:28.381\nBut it does take a little bit of tweaking\nif you will, but you do have to set it up.\n\n30\n00:01:28.381 --> 00:01:33.688\nCuz normally as I said, apps\nare downloaded from the Microsoft store,\n\n31\n00:01:33.688 --> 00:01:36.960\nand that gives us some safety, all right.\n\n32\n00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:43.048\nBecause we know in order for an app to\nmake it to the store, it has to be tested.\n\n33\n00:01:43.048 --> 00:01:46.605\nWe can be fairly confident that it's not\ngonna cause any problems on my machine,\n\n34\n00:01:46.605 --> 00:01:50.390\nyou know, have malware loaded, so that's\nwhy we have to go through those channels.\n\n35\n00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.838\nBut, there are times within an\norganization that we wanna write our own,\n\n36\n00:01:54.838 --> 00:01:59.428\nand we don't want to go through the\nprocess of making them available through\n\n37\n00:01:59.428 --> 00:02:03.680\none of those online stores, and\nthat's where sideloading comes in.\n\n38\n00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.770\nSideloading is a way that we can\ninstall a Windows universal app\n\n39\n00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:10.150\nwithout going through the source.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n40\n00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:13.550\nthen we would have to what, then think\nabout some way to deploy them internally?\n\n41\n00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:14.909\n&gt;&gt; Yep, exactly right, so,\n\n42\n00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:18.754\nthat's what I wanna take a look at here\nand the first thing you'll have to do is\n\n43\n00:02:18.754 --> 00:02:21.790\nyou have to allow it,\nbecause it's not allowed by default.\n\n44\n00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.653\nAll of those Windows store apps and\n\n45\n00:02:23.653 --> 00:02:27.970\nyou have to go through the Windows Store\nto get those Windows those apps.\n\n46\n00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.890\nWhich ever store there is doesn't matter\nbut you have to go through the store.\n\n47\n00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.695\nSide loading is not allowed or\nenabled by default you have to turn it on.\n\n48\n00:02:34.695 --> 00:02:37.856\nSo if you're a developer maybe\nyou wanna turn this on just so\n\n49\n00:02:37.856 --> 00:02:41.880\nthat you can develop apps and\ninstall them on your own test platform.\n\n50\n00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.260\nAnd run them and maybe you do\nplan on making them available,\n\n51\n00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:45.410\nthrough the Windows Store.\n\n52\n00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.452\nMaybe, this is your line of work,\nyou write applications, and so you would\n\n53\n00:02:49.452 --> 00:02:54.090\nneed to install them here and then later\non make them available through the store.\n\n54\n00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.900\nOr, as I said as an organization you\nmight have in-house developers and\n\n55\n00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.590\nthese apps never plan to\nleave your organization.\n\n56\n00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:04.280\nSo you need to install them without\ngoing through the store, either way,\n\n57\n00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.660\nyou go through these same steps,\nso let's take a look at here.\n\n58\n00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.807\nWe can do this either to\nan individual machine or\n\n59\n00:03:10.807 --> 00:03:14.201\nwe can use group policy to enable this,\nall right?\n\n60\n00:03:14.201 --> 00:03:17.490\nOn my Windows 10 machine I'm going\nto go to my Windows menu and\n\n61\n00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:19.050\nthen open up my Settings App.\n\n62\n00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:24.170\nAnd on my Settings App,\nI'm going to go to Update and Security.\n\n63\n00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:28.198\nOn that Updated Security page,\nI've got a for developers node,\n\n64\n00:03:28.198 --> 00:03:31.240\ndown here towards the bottom on the left.\n\n65\n00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:36.100\nAnd if I click that this is where my\nstore app settings are going to be.\n\n66\n00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.800\nAnd you can see these settings\nare intended for development use only.\n\n67\n00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.512\nSo, by default,\nWindows Store apps is selected,\n\n68\n00:03:42.512 --> 00:03:44.790\nonly install apps from the Windows Store.\n\n69\n00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.649\nAgain, this helps me\nkeep my environment safe,\n\n70\n00:03:47.649 --> 00:03:52.396\nmy users aren't just downloading an app\nfrom some random site, all right?\n\n71\n00:03:52.396 --> 00:03:56.003\nHere, check this app out, download it on\nyour machine and it's calling home and\n\n72\n00:03:56.003 --> 00:03:57.382\nopening up doors, open up in,\n\n73\n00:03:57.382 --> 00:03:58.663\nI can't even talk.\n&gt;&gt; Back\n\n74\n00:03:58.663 --> 00:03:59.560\ndoors.\n\n75\n00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:00.153\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n76\n00:04:00.153 --> 00:04:01.080\n&gt;&gt; Opening back doors-\n\n77\n00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.961\n&gt;&gt; We know what you meant, Mike.\n\n78\n00:04:01.961 --> 00:04:04.063\n&gt;&gt; Wow, it's one of those days, right,\n\n79\n00:04:04.063 --> 00:04:06.030\ntrying to go a little too fast.\n\n80\n00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:10.570\nBut yeah, downloading some random\napp from some unknown site and\n\n81\n00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:14.800\ninstalling it on a corporate machine,\nthat's not within our policies.\n\n82\n00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.162\n&gt;&gt; I mean, you've said it several times,\n\n83\n00:04:16.162 --> 00:04:19.553\nbetter safe than sorry, right?\n&gt;&gt; Yes, exactly, so that is the default,\n\n84\n00:04:19.553 --> 00:04:20.417\nthat as I said,\n\n85\n00:04:20.417 --> 00:04:24.360\nthere are gonna be occasions where\nI don't want that default option.\n\n86\n00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:25.790\nEither I'm a developer and\n\n87\n00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:29.790\nI need to install apps that don't come\nfrom the store or we've developed apps\n\n88\n00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:33.700\nin house and I wanna make them available\nto users without going through the store.\n\n89\n00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:37.440\nAnd that's what these two options\nhere are for, side load apps,\n\n90\n00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:42.060\ninstall apps from other sources that\nyou trust, like your work place.\n\n91\n00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:45.950\nIf I choose this option that's going\nto warn me here, it's gonna say\n\n92\n00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:49.840\ninstalling and running apps outside the\nwindows store could expose your device and\n\n93\n00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.720\npersonal data to outside security risks or\nharm your device.\n\n94\n00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:56.220\nOkay, so I was just talking about,\nI'd have to choose Yes or No,\n\n95\n00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:00.183\nI'm gonna choose No, just for a second\nas we continue to talk about this.\n\n96\n00:05:00.183 --> 00:05:03.303\nBut if I choose that option,\nand I enable that,\n\n97\n00:05:03.303 --> 00:05:06.800\nyou notice it says sources that you trust.\n\n98\n00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:10.890\nAny app that you develop is going\nto have to be digitally signed.\n\n99\n00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:12.134\nThat means, we take,\n\n100\n00:05:12.134 --> 00:05:16.500\nwe've been issued a certificate that\nI can use to sign the application.\n\n101\n00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:21.040\nAnd then when I install that application,\nmy computer needs to trust the certificate\n\n102\n00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:24.900\nthat was used, or\nthe root CA that issued the certificate,\n\n103\n00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:29.350\nin that chain is gonna have to trust it,\nin order to install that app.\n\n104\n00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:32.314\nAnd again, that affords me\na little bit of protection,\n\n105\n00:05:32.314 --> 00:05:35.466\nnow I can sideload apps that\ndon't come from the store, but\n\n106\n00:05:35.466 --> 00:05:39.019\nI still need to trust whoever it\nis that wrote those applications.\n\n107\n00:05:39.019 --> 00:05:44.391\nSo again it will help me keep users from\ndownloading apps from unknown sources and\n\n108\n00:05:44.391 --> 00:05:45.971\njust installing them.\n\n109\n00:05:45.971 --> 00:05:49.477\nCuz as an organization I've issued\ncertificates to my developers, and\n\n110\n00:05:49.477 --> 00:05:53.213\nwhen they write these line of business\napplications they sign them with those\n\n111\n00:05:53.213 --> 00:05:54.320\ncertificates.\n\n112\n00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:58.350\nAnd those certificates are trusted within\nmy organization, because they were issued\n\n113\n00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:02.150\nby my own organization's public\nkey infrastructure, all right?\n\n114\n00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:05.923\nSo that allows me to write my own apps and\ninstall them, but\n\n115\n00:06:05.923 --> 00:06:10.857\nstill to have users not able to download\nany app from any site and install it.\n\n116\n00:06:10.857 --> 00:06:14.874\nThe third option, developer mode,\ninstall any signed and trusted app and\n\n117\n00:06:14.874 --> 00:06:19.390\nuse advanced development features,\nthis reduces security a little bit more.\n\n118\n00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:24.710\nThey do have to be signed and trusted,\nand I'm not gonna go into the details of\n\n119\n00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:27.520\nthe advanced development features,\nthat's not what we're here to learn.\n\n120\n00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:31.584\nBut if you're a developer, you'd want to\nchoose this option, gives you the ability\n\n121\n00:06:31.584 --> 00:06:34.640\nto work with the apps and\ntest them even before they're signed.\n\n122\n00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:38.205\nRight, because we have to be able to\nkinda work with them as we're progressing\n\n123\n00:06:38.205 --> 00:06:40.290\nthrough that development process.\n\n124\n00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:44.410\nNow, I'm just gonna choose sideload apps,\nand I'm gonna agree this time to turn on\n\n125\n00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:47.740\napp sideloading, I'll say Yes,\nand there we go.\n\n126\n00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:51.865\nWe can now sideload apps, but that only\napplies to this particular machine.\n\n127\n00:06:51.865 --> 00:06:55.725\nRight and in an organization if we do\ncreate LOB apps line of business apps\n\n128\n00:06:55.725 --> 00:06:58.512\nthat we wanna deploy\nthroughout the organization,\n\n129\n00:06:58.512 --> 00:07:01.550\nI don't wanna have to do\nthis on every machine.\n\n130\n00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:05.675\nSo of course there's a group\npolicy we can use to do that, so\n\n131\n00:07:05.675 --> 00:07:09.816\nif I pull up my domain controller and\nwe edit a group policy.\n\n132\n00:07:09.816 --> 00:07:14.054\nAgain if you want more information about\nworking with group policy make sure you\n\n133\n00:07:14.054 --> 00:07:16.530\ncheck out our episodes\nin our server classes.\n\n134\n00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:21.401\nBut just for quick reference,\nif we go into Computer Configuration\n\n135\n00:07:21.401 --> 00:07:26.188\n&gt; Policies &gt; Administrative Templates\n&gt; Windows Components,\n\n136\n00:07:26.188 --> 00:07:29.725\nand then there's this\nApp Package Deployment.\n\n137\n00:07:29.725 --> 00:07:31.530\nI'll make that a little wider so\nyou can see that.\n\n138\n00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:36.271\nSo again,\nComputer Configuration &gt; Policies &gt;\n\n139\n00:07:36.271 --> 00:07:41.210\nAdministrative Templates Windows\ncomponents, add package deployment.\n\n140\n00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:44.390\nAnd here I can choose to allow\ndevelopment of Windows Store apps and\n\n141\n00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:47.770\ninstalling them from integrated\ndevelopment environment.\n\n142\n00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:51.845\nThat'd be like choosing the developer node\nin those settings we were just looking at.\n\n143\n00:07:51.845 --> 00:07:56.790\nOr allow all trusted apps to install\nis like choosing that side load\n\n144\n00:07:56.790 --> 00:07:59.717\noption that we chose just a minute ago.\n\n145\n00:07:59.717 --> 00:08:00.424\nRight?\n\n146\n00:08:00.424 --> 00:08:04.519\nIn that I can use group policy, and\nthen I can target a group of machines or\n\n147\n00:08:04.519 --> 00:08:07.220\nall machines,\nto enable that setting easily.\n\n148\n00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:12.430\nAll right, once that is turned on\nI'll go ahead and close this, and\n\n149\n00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:15.240\nI wanna make sure I'm logged\non with the right account.\n\n150\n00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:17.680\nAll right, so that has to be turned on,\n\n151\n00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:20.160\nthat has to happen first\nbefore we go any further.\n\n152\n00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:23.366\nOnce that feature is enabled,\nI can now side load apps.\n\n153\n00:08:23.366 --> 00:08:25.375\nThe question is, how do we do that?\n\n154\n00:08:25.375 --> 00:08:28.580\nWell, we've got two tools at our disposal.\n\n155\n00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:32.710\nPowerShell commands and DISM commands.\n\n156\n00:08:32.710 --> 00:08:34.640\nWe're gonna take a look at PowerShell.\n\n157\n00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:37.760\nI'll mention DISM,\nI'll show you one of the commands.\n\n158\n00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:39.850\nWon't run through all of them.\n\n159\n00:08:39.850 --> 00:08:44.660\nBut it is a good idea for\nyou to at least familiarize yourself.\n\n160\n00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:46.000\nWith those commands, so\n\n161\n00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.700\nthat you can recognize them in\na scenario based question on the exam.\n\n162\n00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:54.790\nWe also have to think about whether we're\ninstalling the app for a single user or\n\n163\n00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:57.060\nall users on that device.\n\n164\n00:08:57.060 --> 00:09:00.526\nBecause it's slightly different\ndepending on what we're trying to do.\n\n165\n00:09:00.526 --> 00:09:04.132\nSo Cherokee let's start with.\n&gt;&gt; I know, I was like DISM or PowerShell,\n\n166\n00:09:04.132 --> 00:09:05.673\nwhere are we going with here Mike?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n167\n00:09:05.673 --> 00:09:07.091\nwe're gonna start with PowerShell.\n\n168\n00:09:07.091 --> 00:09:08.641\nAnd we are going to,\n\n169\n00:09:08.641 --> 00:09:13.393\nI wrote an application and\nit's a corny little application.\n\n170\n00:09:13.393 --> 00:09:14.924\nI am not a developer, all right?\n\n171\n00:09:14.924 --> 00:09:18.930\nSo just fair warning it is\nnot a great application.\n\n172\n00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:20.450\nBut I did write one.\n&gt;&gt; Well good job.\n\n173\n00:09:20.450 --> 00:09:22.610\n&gt;&gt; So I am going to move this over to my C\n\n174\n00:09:22.610 --> 00:09:25.260\ndrive just to make it\na little easier to work with.\n\n175\n00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:28.890\nI won't have quite as long\nof a path to type in.\n\n176\n00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:30.290\nLet me copy that source files.\n\n177\n00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:35.815\nSo this would be what your developers\nhave created, packaged up.\n\n178\n00:09:35.815 --> 00:09:40.480\nWe'd then distribute that using whatever\nmethod we do in our organization to\n\n179\n00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:42.210\ndistribute software.\n\n180\n00:09:42.210 --> 00:09:47.830\nAnd now I'm going to open up an\nadministrative PowerShell prompt, right.\n\n181\n00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:51.510\nHere we go.\n\n182\n00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:54.160\nAll right, so, we've enabled that option.\n\n183\n00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:58.310\nIf I want to install this, we're going to\nstart by installing it for a single user.\n\n184\n00:09:58.310 --> 00:10:01.210\nCouple of things that\nwe're going to need to do.\n\n185\n00:10:01.210 --> 00:10:04.500\nThe first thing is that I need\nto install that certificate, so\n\n186\n00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:08.060\nI'm actually going to leave\nPower Shell for just a moment.\n\n187\n00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:11.350\nWhen you write an application and\nyou install it,\n\n188\n00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:13.500\ndepending on what you're using\nto create the application.\n\n189\n00:10:14.788 --> 00:10:18.180\nI used a signature or\ncertificate that was issued to me for\n\n190\n00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:20.930\nthe purposes of signing software.\n\n191\n00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:23.110\nAnd when I packaged\nthis application up for\n\n192\n00:10:23.110 --> 00:10:26.430\ndeployment it included\na copy of that certificate.\n\n193\n00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:29.730\nAnd I can distribute the certificate\nthrough group policy.\n\n194\n00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:32.890\nI want to cover multiple machines,\nI don't have to do this on\n\n195\n00:10:32.890 --> 00:10:37.410\neach individual machine, but I'm simply\ngoing to install this certificate.\n\n196\n00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:41.620\nSo I'm going to double click on it, and\nI'm going to choose install certificate,\n\n197\n00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:44.200\nbut when it comes to troubleshooting and\nworking with this,\n\n198\n00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:47.540\nthis might be a problem,\nwhy can't I side load this application?\n\n199\n00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:50.470\nOne, it could be cuz you don't have\nside loading turned on and enabled.\n\n200\n00:10:50.470 --> 00:10:53.650\nTwo, it could be because you\ndon't trust the signature,\n\n201\n00:10:53.650 --> 00:10:57.060\nthe certificate that was used\nto sign the application.\n\n202\n00:10:57.060 --> 00:11:00.790\nWhen you go to install this, you wanna\ninstall it not for your current user, but\n\n203\n00:11:00.790 --> 00:11:02.050\nfor the local machine.\n\n204\n00:11:02.050 --> 00:11:04.170\nIt is the machine that needs to trust it.\n\n205\n00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:07.830\nWhen that service, when the Windows\nInstaller is running through and\n\n206\n00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:11.210\ninstalling this application, that's\nwhat needs to trust the certificate.\n\n207\n00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:12.840\nIt's not your user account.\n\n208\n00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:15.610\nCuz if you do it to your user,\nwhich was the default here,\n\n209\n00:11:15.610 --> 00:11:19.200\nyou'll run through this process and it'll\nfail, so we don't trust the certificate,\n\n210\n00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:21.120\njust because you didn't\nput it in the right place.\n\n211\n00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:23.150\nSo maybe you've had a user\nthat tried to do this, and\n\n212\n00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:25.070\nyou're trying to figure out what's wrong.\n\n213\n00:11:25.070 --> 00:11:26.670\nLook and see where that certificate is.\n\n214\n00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:29.650\nMake sure that it's in the right location,\nthat it is trusted.\n\n215\n00:11:29.650 --> 00:11:30.697\nSo we're gonna do localmachine.\n\n216\n00:11:30.697 --> 00:11:31.770\nI'll click Next.\n\n217\n00:11:31.770 --> 00:11:34.870\n[SOUND] And yes to my good old UAC.\n\n218\n00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:39.190\nAnd then I'm gonna place\nthe certificate in the following store.\n\n219\n00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:41.170\nYou can use the automatically select.\n\n220\n00:11:41.170 --> 00:11:44.680\nKeep in mind though, if it's\na self-signed certificate like mine,\n\n221\n00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:47.400\nit might end up dumping\nit in the untrusted.\n\n222\n00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:50.510\nBecause when you say automatic,\nit's gonna use its best guess.\n\n223\n00:11:50.510 --> 00:11:53.700\nOoh, this is not a trusted certificate,\nthat's where I'm gonna put it.\n\n224\n00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:56.190\nI'm gonna force it to go into\nmy trusted certificates.\n\n225\n00:11:56.190 --> 00:12:00.250\nSo I'll click browse, and\nI'll dump it in my trusted route, and\n\n226\n00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:03.210\nwe'll click okay, and finish.\n\n227\n00:12:03.210 --> 00:12:05.960\nAnd now that import was successful.\n\n228\n00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:07.470\nAnd we're good to go there.\n\n229\n00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:14.880\nSo now my machine trusts the certificate\nthat was used to sign the app, all right.\n\n230\n00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:19.725\nNext I need to, there's a module for\nPowerShell called AppX for\n\n231\n00:12:19.725 --> 00:12:22.380\nworking with app packages.\n\n232\n00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:29.660\nSo if I do a Get-Module I'll see that\nI do not have that module loaded up.\n\n233\n00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:32.150\nNow, with modern PowerShell,\n\n234\n00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:37.670\nif I start typing a command it should\nfind it if it's in an available module.\n\n235\n00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:40.778\nIf I do a get module list available,\nthat means they're not installed but\n\n236\n00:12:40.778 --> 00:12:44.070\nthey're available,\nit should find the module and\n\n237\n00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:48.410\nload it up automatically if I just start\ntyping the command and make it search.\n\n238\n00:12:48.410 --> 00:12:52.450\nI want to show you though how to actually\nload up the module, just in case.\n\n239\n00:12:52.450 --> 00:12:55.674\nIt's relatively new and\non the exam that they have you go and\n\n240\n00:12:55.674 --> 00:12:59.364\nlist the steps in the proper order for\nside loading an application.\n\n241\n00:12:59.364 --> 00:13:03.306\nIf they have one of the steps\nthey're saying, import this module,\n\n242\n00:13:03.306 --> 00:13:05.254\nmake sure you choose it, right?\n\n243\n00:13:05.254 --> 00:13:09.505\nAll right, so it's gonna be\n\n244\n00:13:09.505 --> 00:13:14.297\nimport-module appx, right?\n\n245\n00:13:14.297 --> 00:13:17.445\nAnd now if I do another get module.\n\n246\n00:13:17.445 --> 00:13:20.240\nI'll see that that module is indeed there.\n\n247\n00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:23.890\nLike I said, if I just started typing\nthe command that we're gonna be using,\n\n248\n00:13:23.890 --> 00:13:27.710\nPowerShell should find the module and\nload it up for me.\n\n249\n00:13:27.710 --> 00:13:29.680\nBut if they're giving\nyou those step by steps,\n\n250\n00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:32.630\nthe drag in the proper order,\nyou might want to include that step.\n\n251\n00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:37.150\nAll right, let's clear up that screen\nnow that we got that module loaded up.\n\n252\n00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:44.050\nAnd the command is add-appxpackage,\nall right.\n\n253\n00:13:44.050 --> 00:13:49.663\nAnd let's do this, let's do a,\n\n254\n00:13:49.663 --> 00:13:55.280\nwhoops, get-help on that one.\n\n255\n00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:58.690\nAnd I don't have my\nonline help loaded up so\n\n256\n00:13:58.690 --> 00:14:02.480\nwe're not gonna get a lot but it does\ngive me some of the syntax for this.\n\n257\n00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:05.530\nAnd this is what I would\nrecommend that you do, all right?\n\n258\n00:14:05.530 --> 00:14:07.390\nIs go through and look at the syntax.\n\n259\n00:14:07.390 --> 00:14:10.810\nLook at the available\nparameters because on an exam,\n\n260\n00:14:10.810 --> 00:14:14.240\nthey can ask you about\na powershell command.\n\n261\n00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:17.415\nAnd it used to be Cherokee,\nthat they would just give you four\n\n262\n00:14:17.415 --> 00:14:18.511\ncommands.\n&gt;&gt; Man.\n\n263\n00:14:18.511 --> 00:14:20.379\n&gt;&gt; And pick the right command, right?\n\n264\n00:14:20.379 --> 00:14:22.516\nSo you have to look at each command and\nyou have to go,\n\n265\n00:14:22.516 --> 00:14:24.910\nwell that's not a possible switch,\nso I know it's not B.\n\n266\n00:14:25.970 --> 00:14:27.880\nThat's not the right command so\nI know it's not C.\n\n267\n00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:32.730\nI will tell you on these newer tests\nthough, I've seen them actually give you\n\n268\n00:14:32.730 --> 00:14:35.982\na series of drop down lists, right?\n&gt;&gt; And you pick and choose.\n\n269\n00:14:35.982 --> 00:14:37.784\n&gt;&gt; And you have to commit each parameter,\n\n270\n00:14:37.784 --> 00:14:39.490\nyes.\n&gt;&gt; Each command lit for the full script,\n\n271\n00:14:39.490 --> 00:14:41.529\nyeah, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; From a drop down list.\n\n272\n00:14:41.529 --> 00:14:46.106\nSo it would behoove you to at least\nbe familiar with what the possible\n\n273\n00:14:46.106 --> 00:14:48.570\nparameters are.\n&gt;&gt; Mike that's no joke.\n\n274\n00:14:48.570 --> 00:14:50.870\nI mean, and\nI'm not even talking about that.\n\n275\n00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:55.620\nBut even before they started doing that,\nI remember sitting down one time and\n\n276\n00:14:56.820 --> 00:15:03.590\nI guess I really underestimated an exam\nI was about to take and I didn't get A,\n\n277\n00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:08.060\nB, C, or D, I got like A through J or\nsomething ridiculous like that.\n\n278\n00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:13.330\nAnd it was just a few letters off on\nthe verb or the noun, it was so similar.\n\n279\n00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:14.880\nAnd I was like, you know what?\n\n280\n00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:18.207\nI swear I thought I knew that but looking\nat so many of these that are so similar.\n\n281\n00:15:18.207 --> 00:15:20.111\nI'm not 100% confident.\n\n282\n00:15:20.111 --> 00:15:23.374\n[LAUGH] So knowing those that's good\nadvice just making sure you know.\n\n283\n00:15:23.374 --> 00:15:25.923\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, what I would recommend is just\n\n284\n00:15:25.923 --> 00:15:27.156\ngoing out to the,\n\n285\n00:15:27.156 --> 00:15:30.550\nopen up your browser type in.\n&gt;&gt; I always do this.\n\n286\n00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:32.060\nI know what you're gonna do.\n\n287\n00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:34.652\nYeah do you type it in just to\nthe browser and you pull it up.\n\n288\n00:15:34.652 --> 00:15:36.070\n&gt;&gt; Appx package And\n\n289\n00:15:36.070 --> 00:15:38.680\nthen go right to docs.microsoft.com.\n\n290\n00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:42.220\nLook for one of the links\nthat says docs.microsoft.com.\n\n291\n00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:44.475\nTechNet's gonna be older content so\ndon't go to TechNet.\n\n292\n00:15:44.475 --> 00:15:47.593\nAnd then here, ooh I hate this theme,\n\n293\n00:15:47.593 --> 00:15:51.564\nlet's darken that up a little bit.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Of course, you would.\n\n294\n00:15:51.564 --> 00:15:52.149\n&gt;&gt; All right?\n\n295\n00:15:52.149 --> 00:15:54.680\n[LAUGH] And here, you can see the command.\n\n296\n00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:56.876\nAll the parameters that are possible.\n\n297\n00:15:56.876 --> 00:16:00.626\nAnd if you go down,\nyou'll see examples as well as.\n\n298\n00:16:00.626 --> 00:16:03.259\nInformation about each\none of those parameters.\n\n299\n00:16:03.259 --> 00:16:07.434\nWhether it's required, what possible\nvalues are, whether it takes positional or\n\n300\n00:16:07.434 --> 00:16:10.800\nif you have to use the name of\nthe parameter, things like that.\n\n301\n00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:15.170\nBut at least you'll see the parameters and\nbe familiar with those, all right?\n\n302\n00:16:15.170 --> 00:16:16.933\nThe easiest way to do that.\n\n303\n00:16:16.933 --> 00:16:18.950\nAll right, back over here to PowerShell.\n\n304\n00:16:18.950 --> 00:16:23.400\nLet's clean that screen up and let's talk\nabout the command we are going to use.\n\n305\n00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:27.202\nSo add add-AppxPackage.\n\n306\n00:16:27.202 --> 00:16:28.670\nCan you guys see that okay?\n\n307\n00:16:28.670 --> 00:16:30.617\nShould I bump that up a little bit?\n&gt;&gt; I'm squinting, but\n\n308\n00:16:30.617 --> 00:16:31.725\nthat doesn't speak on.\n\n309\n00:16:31.725 --> 00:16:34.530\nDon't let me speak for\nother people because I'm.\n\n310\n00:16:34.530 --> 00:16:35.907\n&gt;&gt; Let's bump that up a hair.\n\n311\n00:16:35.907 --> 00:16:37.000\n&gt;&gt; Visually challenged.\n\n312\n00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.870\n&gt;&gt; Let's make sure we got that set to and\n\n313\n00:16:39.870 --> 00:16:42.210\nmy layout is what I need yup.\n\n314\n00:16:42.210 --> 00:16:43.660\nThere we go, is that a little better?\n\n315\n00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:44.566\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; I can zoom into it, as well after\n\n316\n00:16:44.566 --> 00:16:49.558\nwe finish typing this product.\n&gt;&gt; No, that's good, you're good [LAUGH]\n\n317\n00:16:49.558 --> 00:16:50.103\n&gt;&gt; Typing this command,\n\n318\n00:16:50.103 --> 00:16:50.651\ntyping this package.\n\n319\n00:16:50.651 --> 00:16:54.072\nAll right, so\nAdd-AppxPackage is the command.\n\n320\n00:16:54.072 --> 00:16:57.503\nAnd there's really not that many\nparameters that are required.\n\n321\n00:16:57.503 --> 00:17:00.155\nOne, you need the path to the Package, and\n\n322\n00:17:00.155 --> 00:17:03.850\nyou don't even have a parameter well,\nactually, I lied.\n\n323\n00:17:03.850 --> 00:17:05.428\nThere is a path parameter.\n\n324\n00:17:05.428 --> 00:17:10.289\nRemember what I said, though, you can look\nat the syntax and you can see that it will\n\n325\n00:17:10.289 --> 00:17:14.950\naccept positional, so I could actually\nskip the -path and just type the path.\n\n326\n00:17:14.950 --> 00:17:16.509\nAnd it would understand it because\nit knows path should come first.\n\n327\n00:17:16.509 --> 00:17:19.240\n&gt;&gt; Okay, gotcha, okay.\n\n328\n00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:22.090\nSo it just says okay, this is your\nfirst parameter, it must be path.\n\n329\n00:17:22.090 --> 00:17:24.488\nWe'll do -path just to keep\neverything on the up and up.\n\n330\n00:17:24.488 --> 00:17:28.375\nC:\\ where we put that demo and\n\n331\n00:17:28.375 --> 00:17:34.665\nthen within there is going to be the,\n[SOUND] Demo.\n\n332\n00:17:34.665 --> 00:17:37.760\nAnd what I'm doing is I'm\ntabbing through there.\n\n333\n00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:41.334\nI'm looking for the Appx bundle, right?\n\n334\n00:17:41.334 --> 00:17:45.901\nAnd let me show you, c:, And\n\n335\n00:17:45.901 --> 00:17:49.220\nthere's the folder,\ndemo1_ yadda, yadda, yadda.\n\n336\n00:17:49.220 --> 00:17:53.260\nAnd in there, there's an Appx package.\n\n337\n00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:54.800\nNot that one, where'd it go?\n\n338\n00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:56.778\nThere it is right there.\n\n339\n00:17:56.778 --> 00:18:01.234\nLet's turn on my extension so\nyou guys can see that.\n\n340\n00:18:01.234 --> 00:18:05.060\nAnd I'll widen this a little bit,\nthen I'll zoom in for you.\n\n341\n00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:06.890\nThere's a lot of files in here.\n\n342\n00:18:06.890 --> 00:18:10.600\nWhat I need to point this command\nto is the APPX bundle itself.\n\n343\n00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:13.971\nThese other files help it do its job and\ninstall the package,\n\n344\n00:18:13.971 --> 00:18:16.692\nbut what you need to point\nthe command to is this.\n\n345\n00:18:16.692 --> 00:18:20.630\nAnd it'll find everything else,\nbased on where that's located, all right?\n\n346\n00:18:22.570 --> 00:18:26.946\nSo we will jump back over to PowerShell,\nand that's the path I put in here,\n\n347\n00:18:26.946 --> 00:18:28.550\nright to that Appx bundle.\n\n348\n00:18:28.550 --> 00:18:30.088\nLet's blow that up a wee bit there.\n\n349\n00:18:30.088 --> 00:18:36.890\nAll right, space-DependencyPath.\n\n350\n00:18:36.890 --> 00:18:40.162\nYou might or\nmight not need this particular parameter.\n\n351\n00:18:40.162 --> 00:18:41.700\nIt depends on the app that's written.\n\n352\n00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:44.360\nIf the application\npackage has dependencies.\n\n353\n00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:46.410\nThings that it needs to run.\n\n354\n00:18:46.410 --> 00:18:49.531\nThen you need to tell it\nwhere those are as well.\n\n355\n00:18:49.531 --> 00:18:56.027\nLike, in my case, it needs a .NET\nruntime 1.1, or something like this.\n\n356\n00:18:56.027 --> 00:18:58.210\nBut I need to tell it where that is.\n\n357\n00:18:58.210 --> 00:19:01.250\nAnd you might think well it's right there,\nwhen you package,\n\n358\n00:19:01.250 --> 00:19:04.900\nwhen you write an app and you package it\nup, it includes all those dependencies.\n\n359\n00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:06.850\nIn that dependencies folder under x64,\n\n360\n00:19:06.850 --> 00:19:10.930\nbecause I'm going to be installing\nthis on a 64-bit system.\n\n361\n00:19:10.930 --> 00:19:15.355\nI can see it there is the microsoft.net\ncore runtime 1.1 App X, and\n\n362\n00:19:15.355 --> 00:19:17.700\nit's another application.\n\n363\n00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:21.900\nHere's another one for the VC libs for\nmy libraries for Microsoft.\n\n364\n00:19:23.690 --> 00:19:26.250\nBoth of those are needed for\nthis particular app that I wrote.\n\n365\n00:19:26.250 --> 00:19:31.976\nAnd if I don't include those,\nif I just try to run this application,\n\n366\n00:19:31.976 --> 00:19:35.152\nor run this command see what happens.\n\n367\n00:19:36.743 --> 00:19:40.600\nWe get red text, and we know red is\ntypically not good with PowerShell, right?\n\n368\n00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:41.680\n&gt;&gt; What does it say?\n\n369\n00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:42.890\n&gt;&gt; Let's zoom in here and take a look.\n\n370\n00:19:42.890 --> 00:19:48.260\nWhat we're gonna see is, because this\n\n371\n00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:52.380\npackage depends on a framework\nthat could not be found.\n\n372\n00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:55.343\nProvide the framework, and\nthen it tells you what you're missing.\n\n373\n00:19:55.343 --> 00:19:59.167\nMicrosoft .NET CoreRuntime 1.1, right?\n\n374\n00:19:59.167 --> 00:20:02.110\nSo what it's telling me\nis there is a dependency.\n\n375\n00:20:02.110 --> 00:20:06.142\nThis application requires the .NET\nframework for runtime 1.1 and\n\n376\n00:20:06.142 --> 00:20:09.088\nthat's not currently\ninstalled on this machine.\n\n377\n00:20:09.088 --> 00:20:14.020\nSo I need to tell it where it is and\nallow it to install that as well, right?\n\n378\n00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:16.463\nSo we'll bring that command back.\n\n379\n00:20:16.463 --> 00:20:21.280\nAnd we're gonna add\na -dependency path parameter.\n\n380\n00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:26.924\nAnd then the path to that .NET runtime or\n\n381\n00:20:26.924 --> 00:20:32.908\ncore runtime c:\\demo\\dependencies.\n\n382\n00:20:32.908 --> 00:20:38.311\nBack slash x 64, Microsoft run time apex,\n\n383\n00:20:38.311 --> 00:20:41.330\nrun time 1.1.apex.\n\n384\n00:20:41.330 --> 00:20:43.640\nNow, I've already run this to\nmake sure everything works for\n\n385\n00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:45.560\nthe show, on a different machine.\n\n386\n00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:50.037\nI also know there's another dependency,\nthat v c lib that's in there, so\n\n387\n00:20:50.037 --> 00:20:52.607\nif I try to run this\nIt's gonna fail again.\n\n388\n00:20:52.607 --> 00:20:53.427\nTelling me, hey,\n\n389\n00:20:53.427 --> 00:20:57.280\nthere's another dependency that you\nneed to install this application.\n\n390\n00:20:57.280 --> 00:21:00.327\nSo what I'm gonna do,\nthe dependency path parameter for\n\n391\n00:21:00.327 --> 00:21:02.875\nthis PowerShell command\nis actually an array.\n\n392\n00:21:02.875 --> 00:21:08.200\nSo if I have more than one dependency, I\ncan simply provide a comma separated list.\n\n393\n00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:13.088\nSo after that, you can see I\ntyped a little comma right there.\n\n394\n00:21:13.088 --> 00:21:17.825\nAnd I'm gonna add the other dependency,\n\n395\n00:21:17.825 --> 00:21:23.247\nwhich was c:\\demo1dependencies\\x64.\n\n396\n00:21:23.247 --> 00:21:26.349\nAnd then that run time, what was it?\n\n397\n00:21:28.452 --> 00:21:29.630\nWas it Microsoft?\n\n398\n00:21:29.630 --> 00:21:32.785\nYeah, Microsoft.vclibs,\nthere it is right there.\n\n399\n00:21:32.785 --> 00:21:36.050\nSo now I have two dependencies listed,\nand if you had more than that.\n\n400\n00:21:36.050 --> 00:21:39.715\nSimply comma, and the next path,\ncomma, and the next path,\n\n401\n00:21:39.715 --> 00:21:41.914\ntill you have all the dependencies.\n\n402\n00:21:41.914 --> 00:21:45.322\nIf I hadn't installed that signature or\nthat certificate already,\n\n403\n00:21:45.322 --> 00:21:47.100\nI would get another failure.\n\n404\n00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:51.020\nThis would all work so far, but\nthen it would say, there's an issue with\n\n405\n00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:54.910\nthe signature, this can't be trusted,\nand the install would fail.\n\n406\n00:21:54.910 --> 00:21:57.842\nBecause I've already done that,\nI shouldn't get that error this time.\n\n407\n00:21:57.842 --> 00:22:02.088\nSo, we'll hit enter, keep our fingers\ncrossed, and we see the little progress\n\n408\n00:22:02.088 --> 00:22:05.850\nbar going across the top of the PowerShell\nthere, which is a good sign.\n\n409\n00:22:05.850 --> 00:22:06.780\nYes it is, [LAUGH].\n\n410\n00:22:06.780 --> 00:22:09.919\nIf it makes it this far, you,\nyou're pretty sure it's not gonna fail,\n\n411\n00:22:09.919 --> 00:22:10.649\nno guarantees.\n\n412\n00:22:10.649 --> 00:22:12.751\nYou've got a couple bubbles\nleft there though, [LAUGH].\n\n413\n00:22:12.751 --> 00:22:14.298\nI know, there's always that chance right.\n\n414\n00:22:14.298 --> 00:22:18.020\n[LAUGH] And there we go I got\nno red text back, we are,\n\n415\n00:22:18.020 --> 00:22:23.150\nprobably good to go, so\nI'll minimize my PowerShell window.\n\n416\n00:22:23.150 --> 00:22:24.980\nI'll go to my start menu and\n\n417\n00:22:24.980 --> 00:22:28.430\nsure enough right there on top\nis recently added is demo one.\n\n418\n00:22:28.430 --> 00:22:29.920\nI click on that.\n\n419\n00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:31.857\nThere's my little\napplication that I wrote.\n\n420\n00:22:31.857 --> 00:22:33.330\nIt's got one button.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, let's do it.\n\n421\n00:22:33.330 --> 00:22:34.497\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You want me to click it?\n\n422\n00:22:34.497 --> 00:22:35.027\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n423\n00:22:35.027 --> 00:22:35.754\n&gt;&gt; I don't know.\n\n424\n00:22:38.230 --> 00:22:42.586\nITProTV is binge worthy.\n&gt;&gt; Nice Mike!\n\n425\n00:22:42.586 --> 00:22:45.374\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That was the limit of my creativity for\n\n426\n00:22:45.374 --> 00:22:47.254\nmy application, all right?\n\n427\n00:22:47.254 --> 00:22:50.802\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so we'll go ahead and\n\n428\n00:22:50.802 --> 00:22:52.600\nclose that.\n\n429\n00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:55.340\nSo that's installing an App X,\n\n430\n00:22:55.340 --> 00:23:00.900\nor a line of business application,\nusing PowerShell for a single user.\n\n431\n00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:02.180\nIt's one of the things we\nwant to remember here.\n\n432\n00:23:02.180 --> 00:23:05.249\nBecause again on the exam\nthey get you with scenarios.\n\n433\n00:23:05.249 --> 00:23:10.159\nAnd if the scenario says, hey you need\nto install this for User A, perfect,\n\n434\n00:23:10.159 --> 00:23:11.680\nthere you go.\n\n435\n00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:16.564\nBut if they say you need to install this\non all of the users on Computer Client 01.\n\n436\n00:23:16.564 --> 00:23:17.578\nThat's not gonna work,\n\n437\n00:23:17.578 --> 00:23:20.340\nbecause it's only on this user\naccount that I just installed that.\n\n438\n00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:23.820\nI have to do it slightly different\nif I want to install this for\n\n439\n00:23:23.820 --> 00:23:28.180\nall of the profiles on this machine,\nwhich is what we'll do now.\n\n440\n00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:33.974\nLet me switch users real quick,\nand I'm gonna log on as,\n\n441\n00:23:33.974 --> 00:23:38.696\nwe'll use Dan again,\nas our guinea pig here.\n\n442\n00:23:38.696 --> 00:23:40.035\nI broke my machine, sorry.\n\n443\n00:23:40.035 --> 00:23:40.930\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n\n444\n00:23:40.930 --> 00:23:43.560\nOther users, Dan.\n\n445\n00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:44.906\nLog in with his password.\n\n446\n00:23:49.483 --> 00:23:54.721\nAnd just to show you he does not\nhave that demo app installed and\n\n447\n00:23:54.721 --> 00:23:57.559\nit was only for that one profile.\n\n448\n00:23:57.559 --> 00:24:02.423\nSo I'm gonna log off as Daniel because\nwhen I do this, when you install it for\n\n449\n00:24:02.423 --> 00:24:06.679\nall users on a machine They have to\neither sign out and sign back in,\n\n450\n00:24:06.679 --> 00:24:09.050\nif it's an existing account.\n\n451\n00:24:09.050 --> 00:24:11.880\nOr if it's a newly created account\nthe first time they sign in\n\n452\n00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:13.840\nit will install that application.\n\n453\n00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:17.930\nSo switch back over to my admin\naccount that was writing this app.\n\n454\n00:24:17.930 --> 00:24:21.070\nAnd let's see if we can deploy this for\nmultiple users.\n\n455\n00:24:21.070 --> 00:24:22.550\nI'll go and clear my screen.\n\n456\n00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:28.590\nAnd, let's see what I\nwanna do with this guy.\n\n457\n00:24:28.590 --> 00:24:31.270\nWe are going to, let's use DISM for\n\n458\n00:24:31.270 --> 00:24:33.080\nthis one.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n459\n00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:34.530\n&gt;&gt; We'll kinda switch it up a little\n\n460\n00:24:34.530 --> 00:24:35.720\nbit here.\n\n461\n00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:39.790\nDism /online, right?\n\n462\n00:24:39.790 --> 00:24:43.510\nBecause in this case, the machine I'm\ntrying to install it to is online.\n\n463\n00:24:43.510 --> 00:24:49.930\nUnderstand I can also use DISM To push\nthis into a image or an image right.\n\n464\n00:24:49.930 --> 00:24:51.350\nSo if I was gonna deploy an image and\n\n465\n00:24:51.350 --> 00:24:54.510\nI wanted to preload line\nof business applications.\n\n466\n00:24:54.510 --> 00:24:57.060\nI can use this system for that,\nI can use the offline mode.\n\n467\n00:24:57.060 --> 00:25:01.200\nYou have to mount the image up right,\nand this is not the class for that.\n\n468\n00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:05.410\nBut you would do use to mount your image,\nmake it writable.\n\n469\n00:25:05.410 --> 00:25:08.150\nAnd then you would run this\ncommand to load it into the image.\n\n470\n00:25:08.150 --> 00:25:10.890\nAnd then you can pick your changes\nof the image unmounted and\n\n471\n00:25:10.890 --> 00:25:14.420\nthen you deploy your image whatever\nway your organization uses.\n\n472\n00:25:14.420 --> 00:25:16.960\nWhether that is\nWindows Deployment Services or\n\n473\n00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:19.930\nSystems Center Configuration Manager or\nwhat have you.\n\n474\n00:25:19.930 --> 00:25:21.890\nBut now it's preloaded into the image.\n\n475\n00:25:21.890 --> 00:25:23.480\nSo I don't have to do this after the fact.\n\n476\n00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:24.790\nI just deploy the image.\n\n477\n00:25:24.790 --> 00:25:28.480\nThey log on and\nthe application is there, all right?\n\n478\n00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:32.605\nSo in this case though it's online, so\n\n479\n00:25:32.605 --> 00:25:36.364\ndism /online/add-provision.\n\n480\n00:25:36.364 --> 00:25:41.595\nIf I can spell Provisioned [CROSSTALK].\n&gt;&gt; That's\n\n481\n00:25:41.595 --> 00:25:43.265\nalways my PowerShell challenge.\n\n482\n00:25:43.265 --> 00:25:44.305\n&gt;&gt; Package.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n483\n00:25:44.305 --> 00:25:45.445\n&gt;&gt; And because this is and\n\n484\n00:25:45.445 --> 00:25:47.625\nnot PowerShell per se.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n485\n00:25:47.625 --> 00:25:49.019\nPowerShell.\nYou can't [CROSSTALK] through.\n\n486\n00:25:49.019 --> 00:25:53.145\nYour favorite thing is missing in.\n&gt;&gt; Doesn't work here, right?\n\n487\n00:25:53.145 --> 00:25:59.985\nSo online add- provisioned\nappx package / package path.\n\n488\n00:25:59.985 --> 00:26:04.895\n: and no space here.\n\n489\n00:26:04.895 --> 00:26:08.639\n/packagepath: and then the path, c:/.\n\n490\n00:26:08.639 --> 00:26:11.060\nWhere did I put that demo?\n\n491\n00:26:11.060 --> 00:26:13.760\nNow, I'll show you a little trick.\n\n492\n00:26:14.820 --> 00:26:18.630\nWindows paths will tab autofill,\neven though it's not a PowerShell command.\n\n493\n00:26:18.630 --> 00:26:22.890\nBut because there's not space in front of\nthe c It's reading this whole thing and\n\n494\n00:26:22.890 --> 00:26:24.158\ndoesn't see it as a Windows path.\n\n495\n00:26:24.158 --> 00:26:26.100\nI'm lazy.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n496\n00:26:26.100 --> 00:26:28.276\n&gt;&gt; And so what I'll do is I'll put a space\n\n497\n00:26:28.276 --> 00:26:31.611\nthere knowing that's going to\nbreak the command, just so\n\n498\n00:26:31.611 --> 00:26:33.462\nI can tab out of my Windows path.\n\n499\n00:26:33.462 --> 00:26:35.780\nAnd then I'll remove\nthat space when I'm done.\n\n500\n00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:36.765\nSo just a little trick.\n\n501\n00:26:36.765 --> 00:26:37.460\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Good one Mike.\n\n502\n00:26:37.460 --> 00:26:38.100\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Pass\n\n503\n00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:39.320\nit along to you guys there.\n\n504\n00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:43.330\nAnd again we're looking for the Appx\nbundle right, not just the folder.\n\n505\n00:26:43.330 --> 00:26:45.610\nSo the appX bundle, we'll do demo.\n\n506\n00:26:45.610 --> 00:26:49.890\nAnd I'll keep tabbing until I\nfind that appX bundle, right.\n\n507\n00:26:49.890 --> 00:26:51.611\nNow I'm gonna back up.\n\n508\n00:26:54.027 --> 00:26:55.560\nAnd remove that space.\n\n509\n00:26:55.560 --> 00:26:59.800\nIf I don't remove that space I'm gonna\nget an error that says, c:\\demo yada,\n\n510\n00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:02.900\nyada is not a recognized parameter.\n\n511\n00:27:02.900 --> 00:27:03.920\nThere can't be a space in there.\n\n512\n00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:06.700\nIt has to be pushed up together, alright?\n\n513\n00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:10.560\nThen we're going to do forward slash,\nskip, or license.\n\n514\n00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:13.730\nBecause I didn't set up a license for\nthis or anything like that.\n\n515\n00:27:15.460 --> 00:27:16.555\nAgain, I, oops, misspelled.\n\n516\n00:27:16.555 --> 00:27:17.085\nSpell.\n\n517\n00:27:17.085 --> 00:27:19.265\nSkip license.\n&gt;&gt; I hope you trademarked it or\n\n518\n00:27:19.265 --> 00:27:22.458\npatented it or whatever for\nthis [LAUGH] media here, yeah.\n\n519\n00:27:22.458 --> 00:27:25.235\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'll make this available if you want\n\n520\n00:27:25.235 --> 00:27:29.355\nit, everybody wants it and\nthis is ITPro.TV is binge-worthy, yeah.\n\n521\n00:27:29.355 --> 00:27:34.575\nAll right, so I'll hit Enter,\nDISM fires up and begins the process.\n\n522\n00:27:37.158 --> 00:27:39.590\nNow, it says the operation\ncompleted successfully, see?\n\n523\n00:27:39.590 --> 00:27:41.930\nNot a very long process, all right?\n\n524\n00:27:41.930 --> 00:27:44.560\nSo we'll minimize that for a second.\n\n525\n00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:47.880\nAnd now I'm gonna log\non as a different user.\n\n526\n00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:49.084\nSo I'm going to switch account.\n\n527\n00:27:51.464 --> 00:27:54.270\nAnd let's just use Daniel\nagain as our guinea pig.\n\n528\n00:27:55.660 --> 00:27:56.350\nNow log on, you see?\n\n529\n00:27:56.350 --> 00:27:57.860\nWe had Cherokee, I got you in here too.\n\n530\n00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:02.230\nI know all the IT Pro TV hosts.\n\n531\n00:28:02.230 --> 00:28:04.870\nLet's see.\n\n532\n00:28:04.870 --> 00:28:06.830\nSo now I'm logged on as Daniel.\n\n533\n00:28:06.830 --> 00:28:08.760\nI go to my Start menu.\n\n534\n00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:10.230\nAnd I don't see it yet.\n\n535\n00:28:10.230 --> 00:28:13.440\nAnd this has happened to me before,\nbut that's okay.\n\n536\n00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:14.930\nGive it just a second.\n\n537\n00:28:14.930 --> 00:28:17.460\nRemember this happens\nwhen the user logs on.\n\n538\n00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:18.500\nIt doesn't go ahead and\n\n539\n00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:22.500\ninstall on everybody's profile in\nthe background when I ran the command.\n\n540\n00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:25.060\nIt's provisioning the application.\n\n541\n00:28:25.060 --> 00:28:30.460\nIt's getting it's setup for installation,\nbut it's not until the user logs on.\n\n542\n00:28:30.460 --> 00:28:33.320\nIf the user is already logged on,\nthe app will never show up.\n\n543\n00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:35.880\nThey'll have to log off, and log back on.\n\n544\n00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:39.350\nIt's a newly created account When\nthey log on, they'll get the app.\n\n545\n00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:42.400\nSo if I go here now, and\nsure enough, I talked long enough.\n\n546\n00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:45.140\nThere's Demo1 right at\nthe top of my Start Menu.\n\n547\n00:28:45.140 --> 00:28:47.970\nDaniel can launch it.\n&gt;&gt; ITProTV\n\n548\n00:28:47.970 --> 00:28:48.800\nis binge worthy.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n549\n00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:51.280\n&gt;&gt; And it works, woo hoo, all right?\n\n550\n00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:54.240\nAnd no certificate to worry about,\nbecause remember,\n\n551\n00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:56.200\nI installed that certificate earlier.\n\n552\n00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:59.120\nInto the trusted root\ncertification authorities for\n\n553\n00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:01.180\nthe machine, not from our user account.\n\n554\n00:29:01.180 --> 00:29:04.700\nSo that means every user on this\ncomputer will trust that certificate.\n\n555\n00:29:04.700 --> 00:29:08.780\nIn other words, it's really the machine\nthat's trusting that certificate.\n\n556\n00:29:08.780 --> 00:29:10.150\nAll right, I know we're short on time.\n\n557\n00:29:10.150 --> 00:29:12.990\nA couple of other things I\nwant to mention in here.\n\n558\n00:29:12.990 --> 00:29:16.610\nSo we saw side loading for a single user,\nin that case we used power shell.\n\n559\n00:29:16.610 --> 00:29:21.780\nIn that app x module,\nthe command was add-appxpackage.\n\n560\n00:29:21.780 --> 00:29:25.800\nAnd this is where it gets\nreally twisty alright.\n\n561\n00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:27.995\nSo when you're studying,\nbe very careful with this.\n\n562\n00:29:27.995 --> 00:29:35.104\nPower shell, single user,\nadd-appxpackage, Dism.\n\n563\n00:29:35.104 --> 00:29:39.528\nAll users online image is going to\n\n564\n00:29:39.528 --> 00:29:44.460\nbe add-provisionedappxpackage.\n\n565\n00:29:44.460 --> 00:29:49.005\nPowershell for\nan offline image using dism,\n\n566\n00:29:49.005 --> 00:29:55.460\nadd-appxprovisionpackage, talk\nabout confusing.\n\n567\n00:29:55.460 --> 00:30:00.140\nSo with Dizzim add\nprovisioned appX package.\n\n568\n00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:04.640\nWith Powershell add appX\nprovisioned package.\n\n569\n00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:06.760\nThey flipped the word provision and appX.\n\n570\n00:30:07.980 --> 00:30:13.360\nI can't make it any You\njust have to memorize that,\n\n571\n00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:15.570\nyou have to go and\nlook at that and memorize it.\n\n572\n00:30:15.570 --> 00:30:19.120\nI know you're probably thinking But if you\nsay the same thing, it sounds the same.\n\n573\n00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:26.570\nBut if you pay attention, provisioned\nAppXPackage versus AppXProvisionedPackage.\n\n574\n00:30:26.570 --> 00:30:29.280\nIt's very confusing, so\nbe careful with that.\n\n575\n00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:32.540\nThat's a gotcha on the exam.\n\n576\n00:30:32.540 --> 00:30:34.610\nWhat else?\nThe only other command I can think they\n\n577\n00:30:34.610 --> 00:30:38.450\nmight call you with would\nbe Get-AppXPackage.\n\n578\n00:30:38.450 --> 00:30:40.660\nAnd this shows you all\nprovisioned packages.\n\n579\n00:30:40.660 --> 00:30:42.160\nI can run it real quick.\n\n580\n00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:42.760\nI know Cherokee is\n\n581\n00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:44.790\ngetting ready to cut us off on the time.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n582\n00:30:44.790 --> 00:30:47.020\n&gt;&gt; We flip back over to my Admin account,\n\n583\n00:30:48.060 --> 00:30:49.420\nwhere I've got PowerShell opened already.\n\n584\n00:30:51.370 --> 00:30:59.331\nAnd you could run the command get-\nI forgot the command appxpackage.\n\n585\n00:31:03.918 --> 00:31:08.870\nAll right, yeah,\n[INAUDIBLE] there should just one.\n\n586\n00:31:08.870 --> 00:31:10.940\nNow, here's the one, where is it?\n\n587\n00:31:10.940 --> 00:31:12.620\nIt should be right here at the bottom.\n\n588\n00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:15.510\nYeah, there's demo.\n\n589\n00:31:17.750 --> 00:31:19.560\nWhere's the name?\n\n590\n00:31:19.560 --> 00:31:22.840\nDoesn't show me the name, but this is\nthe one published by Michael, right?\n\n591\n00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:24.790\nThat's the app we just installed.\n\n592\n00:31:24.790 --> 00:31:27.140\nThere's that .NET core runtime one one,\n\n593\n00:31:27.140 --> 00:31:30.560\nthat was another package we had\nto install, the dependency.\n\n594\n00:31:30.560 --> 00:31:32.410\nThere's that VC lib, right?\n\n595\n00:31:32.410 --> 00:31:33.790\nBut then, you'll see all these other ones,\n\n596\n00:31:33.790 --> 00:31:38.660\nall those apps that get provisioned on\nour start menu when we first log in.\n\n597\n00:31:38.660 --> 00:31:40.620\nThe supervision app packages as well.\n\n598\n00:31:40.620 --> 00:31:42.260\nJust like that lob that we just did,\n\n599\n00:31:42.260 --> 00:31:48.440\nyou're going to see things like Candy\nCrush and the store, the Microsoft store.\n\n600\n00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:50.820\nThere's the solitaire collection.\n\n601\n00:31:50.820 --> 00:31:53.990\nSo a good command to\nknow get app.fx package.\n\n602\n00:31:53.990 --> 00:31:58.690\nIf you try to see what packages have been\nprovisioned on a particular machine.\n\n603\n00:31:58.690 --> 00:32:02.950\nSo there you go sideloading apps\nusing DISM and PowerShell or\n\n604\n00:32:02.950 --> 00:32:06.470\nsideloading line of business applications.\n&gt;&gt; A lot of great information there.\n\n605\n00:32:06.470 --> 00:32:09.050\nSo there you go sideloading apps\nusing DISM and PowerShell or\n\n606\n00:32:09.050 --> 00:32:11.030\nsideloading line of business applications.\n\n607\n00:32:11.030 --> 00:32:11.948\nSo there you go sideloading apps\nusing DISM and PowerShell or\n\n608\n00:32:11.948 --> 00:32:12.650\nsideloading line of business applications.\n\n609\n00:32:12.650 --> 00:32:14.870\nI've been your host Cherokee Boose.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Roderick.\n\n610\n00:32:14.870 --> 00:32:18.241\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n611\n00:32:18.241 --> 00:32:24.186\n[MUSIC]\n\n612\n00:32:24.186

coming to you live from\nSan Francisco, California.\n\n4\n00:00:05.324 --> 00:00:08.639\n&gt;&gt; You're watching\n\n5\n00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.010\nITProTV.\n&gt;&gt; Welcome everyone to your\n\n6\n00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:15.270\nConfiguring Windows Devices series.\n\n7\n00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:18.480\nStudying for that 70-697 exam.\n\n8\n00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.260\nI'm your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n9\n00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:24.076\nHere we are into part four where we'll\ncontinue to take a look at how we can\n\n10\n00:00:24.076 --> 00:00:26.465\nsupport our Microsoft Store and\ncloud apps.\n\n11\n00:00:26.465 --> 00:00:30.730\nAnd of course, with us today back in\nstudios, we have Mr. Mike Rodrick.\n\n12\n00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.120\nThanks for joining us, Mike.\n&gt;&gt; Hey, Cherokee, yeah, thanks for\n\n13\n00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:33.760\nhaving me back.\n\n14\n00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:34.403\nAnd yeah,\n\n15\n00:00:34.403 --> 00:00:39.553\ncontinuing on that miniseries that it has\nbeen supporting these storing cloud apps.\n\n16\n00:00:39.553 --> 00:00:43.953\nWe do have just a couple more things to\ntalk about in this particular domain or\n\n17\n00:00:43.953 --> 00:00:46.280\nset of objectives for this exam.\n\n18\n00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.852\nAnd that is side loading apps\nusing Microsoft Intune and\n\n19\n00:00:49.852 --> 00:00:53.170\ndeep linking apps using Microsoft Intune.\n\n20\n00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.109\nAnd the concept of side loading\nshouldn't be new, right?\n\n21\n00:00:55.109 --> 00:00:58.970\nIf you've watched the previous episodes,\nwe looked at what side loading meant.\n\n22\n00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:04.210\nNormally, our modern Windows apps\nare obtained through the Microsoft Store.\n\n23\n00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:07.030\nWhether that's the store\navailable to the public, or\n\n24\n00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.760\nthe Microsoft Store for Business, or\nthe Microsoft Store for Education.\n\n25\n00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.920\nMaybe we've developed line\nof business apps, and\n\n26\n00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.442\nwe submit them or put them in those\nstores, make them available that way.\n\n27\n00:01:16.442 --> 00:01:20.761\nWell we talked about side loading and how\nthat's when we take a line of business app\n\n28\n00:01:20.761 --> 00:01:23.843\nthat we don't want to make\ngeneral public availability.\n\n29\n00:01:23.843 --> 00:01:26.891\nWe just want to install it\non our machines in-house and\n\n30\n00:01:26.891 --> 00:01:29.489\nnot distribute it through the store,\nright?\n\n31\n00:01:29.489 --> 00:01:32.501\nWe can side load it using\nour PowerShell commands,\n\n32\n00:01:32.501 --> 00:01:34.471\nwe also saw how we could use DISM.\n\n33\n00:01:34.471 --> 00:01:39.015\nAnd we can do that in an online image or\nan offline image in a Windows image that\n\n34\n00:01:39.015 --> 00:01:42.530\nwe're getting ready to deploy\nout to multiple machines.\n\n35\n00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.420\nSo we've seen that concept,\n\n36\n00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.589\nnow we wanna talk about how we can\nuse Intune to side load, right?\n\n37\n00:01:48.589 --> 00:01:53.650\nAnd Microsoft Intune is a mobile\ndevice management platform that used\n\n38\n00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:58.551\nto be kind of a standalone,\nwhere it's now integrated into Azure.\n\n39\n00:01:58.551 --> 00:02:01.638\nSo that's where we're gonna\nend up as going into Azure and\n\n40\n00:02:01.638 --> 00:02:04.640\ntaking a look at Intune there,\nbut it gives me a way.\n\n41\n00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.130\nWhen we talk about devices today,\nit's not like way back when,\n\n42\n00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:11.585\nwhen we just had corporate devices, right?\n\n43\n00:02:11.585 --> 00:02:15.680\nCorporate-owned devices that were\nconnected to our network and\n\n44\n00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.630\nwe could deploy software a number\nof different means in-house.\n\n45\n00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:24.540\nNow we're talking about being able to\nsupport many different types of devices,\n\n46\n00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.720\ndevices that are maybe not part of our\ndomain and taking advantage of Azure and\n\n47\n00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.480\nMicrosoft's cloud solutions\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n48\n00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.145\neveryone's already got a smartphone,\nwhy not put them to work?\n\n49\n00:02:34.145 --> 00:02:35.583\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they can bring them,\n\n50\n00:02:35.583 --> 00:02:38.261\nbuy their own laptops, we don't have\nto provide them as much anymore.\n\n51\n00:02:38.261 --> 00:02:39.740\nSaves us money in the long run.\n\n52\n00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:41.255\nSo that's what we wanna look at today and\n\n53\n00:02:41.255 --> 00:02:43.410\nwe talk about side loading\nthrough Microsoft Intune.\n\n54\n00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.930\nWe're talking about making these apps\navailable to any device that has Internet\n\n55\n00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:47.790\nconnectivity.\n\n56\n00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.690\nThat as long as my user,\nan authorized user, has\n\n57\n00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:55.230\na device that can connect to the Internet,\nthey can connect to the Azure portal or\n\n58\n00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.060\nAzure and Intune through that,\nand they could obtain these apps.\n\n59\n00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.270\nSo that's what we wanna\ntake a look at here.\n\n60\n00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:02.610\nWe're gonna take a look at both sides.\n\n61\n00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.830\nI know this is a client-based exam,\n\n62\n00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:09.420\nbut we do need to see the Azure side\nof things and how things are set up.\n\n63\n00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.170\nCould be something they ask\nyou on this particular exam.\n\n64\n00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:12.201\nSo that's what we'll do.\n\n65\n00:03:12.201 --> 00:03:15.746\nI think Tenisha's already\npulled my screen, so\n\n66\n00:03:15.746 --> 00:03:21.010\nI'm logged into my Azure portal and\nI am gonna go to my Intune blade.\n\n67\n00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.616\nIf you don't see the Intune blade,\nit might not be there by default.\n\n68\n00:03:23.616 --> 00:03:28.156\nYou can always go out to All services,\nfind that Intune, and\n\n69\n00:03:28.156 --> 00:03:31.750\npin it to or\nadd it to your list of favorites.\n\n70\n00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.090\nAnd I'm gonna click on Intune,\nwhich brings me here.\n\n71\n00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:38.457\nAnd in my Intune,\nnow let me back up for just one second,\n\n72\n00:03:38.457 --> 00:03:41.263\nthere is what's known\nas the classic portal.\n\n73\n00:03:41.263 --> 00:03:43.622\nAnd as you're studying for this exam,\n\n74\n00:03:43.622 --> 00:03:47.310\nyou might see a lot of reference\nto the classic portal.\n\n75\n00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.943\nBecause it was just recently-\n&gt;&gt; Revamped.\n\n76\n00:03:49.943 --> 00:03:50.866\n&gt;&gt; Well, shut down,\n\n77\n00:03:50.866 --> 00:03:52.348\nright?\n&gt;&gt; There's no more access.\n\n78\n00:03:52.348 --> 00:03:54.709\nIn fact,\nif I try to click on it through Chrome,\n\n79\n00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:57.080\nI don't even think it's\ngonna let me go there.\n\n80\n00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.980\nLet's see what it does.\n\n81\n00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:05.137\nSo Microsoft said April, the beginning\nof April, 2018, which there we go.\n\n82\n00:04:05.137 --> 00:04:09.934\nI've got an unsupported browser, if\nyou're running IE in compatibility mode,\n\n83\n00:04:09.934 --> 00:04:11.560\nif you wanna look at.\n\n84\n00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.259\nAnyway, it's not important.\nI don't even wanna look at the list of\n\n85\n00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:15.008\nsupported browsers because\nthis is going away.\n\n86\n00:04:15.008 --> 00:04:17.846\nAnd the reason I mention this again is\nbecause if you go out there and you study,\n\n87\n00:04:17.846 --> 00:04:19.437\nand you're looking at the documentation.\n\n88\n00:04:19.437 --> 00:04:26.852\nYou might see reference to this\nadmin.manage@microsoft.com and\n\n89\n00:04:26.852 --> 00:04:29.570\nthis portal for Intune.\n\n90\n00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:31.300\nUnderstand that that\ndoesn't exist anymore.\n\n91\n00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:34.020\nOr it's going away.\n\n92\n00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:37.890\nSo you want to make sure you familiarize\nyourself with dealing with Intune\n\n93\n00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:39.090\nthrough the Azure portal.\n\n94\n00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:41.150\nSet your up your trial subscriptions.\n\n95\n00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:44.820\nTake advantage of those and\nplay around up here in Azure.\n\n96\n00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:49.000\nSo all right, back to the matter at hand,\nI am in the Microsoft Intune blade.\n\n97\n00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.230\nAnd what I'm gonna do is scroll\ndown a little bit here and\n\n98\n00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:54.020\nchoose Mobile apps right?\n\n99\n00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:56.140\nGive it just a second to load up.\n\n100\n00:04:56.140 --> 00:05:01.850\nOnce I click on Mobile apps,\nthen I'm gonna click on Apps, all right?\n\n101\n00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:04.590\nI've already set up a couple of these\nbecause I wanted to make sure they were\n\n102\n00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:06.040\nready for us,\n\n103\n00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:09.760\nsometimes it can take a few minutes\nbefore it shows up on user's devices.\n\n104\n00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:11.180\nI'll show you what I\nmean here in a second,\n\n105\n00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:15.270\nso we've got a couple already added but\nI want to walk through the process.\n\n106\n00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:17.590\nSo when we talk about\nside loading with Intune,\n\n107\n00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:20.263\nwe're talking about line\nof business applications.\n\n108\n00:05:20.263 --> 00:05:21.961\nThese are developed in-house,\n\n109\n00:05:21.961 --> 00:05:25.295\nmaybe you wrote them or\nyou've got developers that write them and\n\n110\n00:05:25.295 --> 00:05:29.310\nyou wanna distribute them out to your\nusers and you wanna use Intune to do that.\n\n111\n00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:35.040\nSo you'd simply come into Azure, navigate\nyour way into Intune &gt; Mobile apps &gt; Apps,\n\n112\n00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:37.980\nand then you click Add, right?\n\n113\n00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:40.809\nOpens up another blade and\nI've got a drop down list over here.\n\n114\n00:05:40.809 --> 00:05:44.050\nYou see I've got App type.\n\n115\n00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:45.935\nAnd when I hit that drop down list,\n\n116\n00:05:45.935 --> 00:05:49.522\ndown towards the bottom of this\nlist is Line-of-business app.\n\n117\n00:05:49.522 --> 00:05:53.331\nSo we're gonna select that and\nthen it simply wants me to,\n\n118\n00:05:53.331 --> 00:05:55.210\nthis says App package file.\n\n119\n00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:58.268\nSelect file.\nSo I need to browse and find the appx or\n\n120\n00:05:58.268 --> 00:06:01.666\nthe appx bundle that we've created, right?\n\n121\n00:06:01.666 --> 00:06:05.014\nYou either get that from my developers,\nor if I've written it.\n\n122\n00:06:05.014 --> 00:06:06.115\nWe'll select that.\n\n123\n00:06:06.115 --> 00:06:07.986\nAnd we're gonna browse.\n\n124\n00:06:07.986 --> 00:06:09.590\nAnd we're gonna use that same.\n\n125\n00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:11.859\nI'm gonna have to zoom back out so\nI can navigate around,\n\n126\n00:06:11.859 --> 00:06:14.337\nthat demo app that we used the other\nday in one of our episodes.\n\n127\n00:06:14.337 --> 00:06:20.453\nI'm gonna find that appx bundle\nright there, and click Open.\n\n128\n00:06:20.453 --> 00:06:24.696\nRight, and you can see Azure's\nreading information from that and\n\n129\n00:06:24.696 --> 00:06:27.587\nI can see what platforms\nthis is gonna run on.\n\n130\n00:06:27.587 --> 00:06:31.050\nI've got the version number, the size.\n\n131\n00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:35.410\nIt gives it a really funky name which\nwe're gonna change in just a minute.\n\n132\n00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:38.055\nSo now that I've found the app package,\nI'll click OK.\n\n133\n00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:43.170\nAnd then below that I've got\nApp information and Configure.\n\n134\n00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:45.410\nYou see these little red asterisks?\n\n135\n00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:47.470\nThose mean these are required so\n\n136\n00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:50.380\nyou do have to go through\neach one of these, right?\n\n137\n00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:54.551\nI'll click Configure and then I'm gonna\nget information about the app that I'm\n\n138\n00:06:54.551 --> 00:06:56.706\ngetting ready to set up for side loading.\n\n139\n00:06:56.706 --> 00:07:00.635\nAnd here's that name that I was\nsaying it generates for you.\n\n140\n00:07:00.635 --> 00:07:03.476\nYou're welcome to change this,\nI'm gonna call this Demo 1.\n\n141\n00:07:03.476 --> 00:07:09.070\nThey do want a description, and\nnormally descriptions are not required.\n\n142\n00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:10.074\nBut Cherokee, in this case,\n\n143\n00:07:10.074 --> 00:07:12.937\nit's got that red asterisk there meaning\nI'm gonna have to put something in there.\n\n144\n00:07:12.937 --> 00:07:19.803\nA test of sideloading with Intune.\n\n145\n00:07:19.803 --> 00:07:22.531\nMaybe something like that,\nor whatever you wanna put.\n\n146\n00:07:22.531 --> 00:07:25.354\nThe publisher,\nthis is based on that signature.\n\n147\n00:07:25.354 --> 00:07:27.797\nRemember, these apps have\nto be digitally signed.\n\n148\n00:07:27.797 --> 00:07:32.540\nI used a self-signed certificate so\nit shows me as the publisher.\n\n149\n00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:35.150\nAnd then below that we have Category.\n\n150\n00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:37.980\nAnd this will come into play when\n\n151\n00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:41.490\nour users start browsing through\nwhat's known as the company portal.\n\n152\n00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:44.750\nThey can filter apps based on categories.\n\n153\n00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:46.850\nMake it easier for them to find.\n\n154\n00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:49.050\nAnd we can put an app\nin several categories.\n\n155\n00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:53.405\nI might put this in Productivity,\nas well as Development and Design, and\n\n156\n00:07:53.405 --> 00:07:55.522\nyou can put it in as many as you want.\n\n157\n00:07:55.522 --> 00:08:01.380\nAnd then below that, I have display this\nas a featured app In the company portal,\n\n158\n00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:03.373\nand I'm gonna choose yes.\n\n159\n00:08:03.373 --> 00:08:05.253\nAnd I'll show you what\nthat company portal is,\n\n160\n00:08:05.253 --> 00:08:08.240\nyou'll see what we're talking\nabout here in just a second.\n\n161\n00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:10.820\nI'll zoom back out,\nscroll down a little further.\n\n162\n00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:16.110\nThere are some more fields you can\nfill in, information URL, privacy URL.\n\n163\n00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:20.030\nIf have some kind of company privacy\npolicy that you wanted to make sure they\n\n164\n00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:20.920\ncould read.\n\n165\n00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:23.380\nGive them a link too,\nyou can throw that in here.\n\n166\n00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:26.350\nDeveloper, Owner, Notes,\nthere's no asterisk,\n\n167\n00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:28.570\nnone of those fields are required.\n\n168\n00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:30.260\nYou can even do a logo, right?\n\n169\n00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:33.120\nSo if you wanted to go and\nbrowse and find a logo for your app,\n\n170\n00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:35.260\nyou could include that.\n\n171\n00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:39.620\nAnd then once I've filled out all\nof that information, I'll click OK.\n\n172\n00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:44.540\nThat takes me back to the add app\nblade everything is configured.\n\n173\n00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:49.200\nI'm good I will click add it says saving.\n\n174\n00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.950\nAnd if I close this little message\nhere this is just telling me\n\n175\n00:08:54.950 --> 00:08:56.170\nthat it's created the app.\n\n176\n00:08:56.170 --> 00:08:58.970\nIt's uploading the files so\nthat it could be distributed.\n\n177\n00:08:58.970 --> 00:09:02.380\nI'm gonna close these little pop-up\nmessages so we can see what's behind it.\n\n178\n00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:07.120\nOops, it's happy about uploading that.\n\n179\n00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:10.660\nI'm gonna close that one more time or\nwe just wait untill it's done.\n\n180\n00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:13.210\nBecause it's gonna keep reminding\nme that it's uploading.\n\n181\n00:09:13.210 --> 00:09:15.720\nAnd we've seen a message to do that.\n\n182\n00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:18.410\nWe'll wait, there we go,\nstaying away this time.\n\n183\n00:09:18.410 --> 00:09:21.128\nAnd [INAUDIBLE] across the top,\n\n184\n00:09:21.128 --> 00:09:25.240\n[LAUGH] I love you Azure,\nwe'll close that one more time.\n\n185\n00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:29.500\nAnyway, what it was trying to say\nwas that you're not done yet.\n\n186\n00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:32.980\nAnd once you've created it,\nyou've uploaded your files,\n\n187\n00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:35.580\nyour apex package,\nyou've filled everything out.\n\n188\n00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:36.900\nYou're ready to start deploying it,\n\n189\n00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:41.000\nyou have to decide who is\nallowed to get this application.\n\n190\n00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.490\nAnd that's what that little message\nthat pink bar was showing me.\n\n191\n00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:47.790\nIt's gone away so\n\n192\n00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:52.410\nI'm just going to click in the app it\nself to get back into those settings.\n\n193\n00:09:52.410 --> 00:09:55.750\nBut if you look over here\nI've got this assigned column\n\n194\n00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:58.940\nthe two that I did earlier\nboth say yes this one says no.\n\n195\n00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:02.220\nThis is the one we just did and\nthis is what that message was saying\n\n196\n00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:05.730\nyou're not done until you've\nassigned this app in other words.\n\n197\n00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:08.920\nNobody's gonna get it until\nyou actually assign it.\n\n198\n00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:13.940\nSo we're gonna click on that and\nthen we're gonna click assignments.\n\n199\n00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:17.980\nThere you can see that message again\nassign application to at least one group.\n\n200\n00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:22.080\nSo we'll click assignments and\nthen we'll click add group.\n\n201\n00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:26.200\nI can choose my assignment type.\n\n202\n00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:30.640\nI've got Available for enrolled devices,\nRequired, or Uninstall.\n\n203\n00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:34.730\nAvailable for enrolled devices, that means\nif your device is enrolled in MDM or\n\n204\n00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:36.830\nIntune for mobile device management.\n\n205\n00:10:36.830 --> 00:10:40.710\nYou'd be able to receive this application.\n&gt;&gt; That's really cool because even some of\n\n206\n00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:44.050\nthe other things that\nyou were showing us for\n\n207\n00:10:44.050 --> 00:10:45.560\n&gt;&gt; Selecting categories for\n\n208\n00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:46.570\nthe app and so forth.\n\n209\n00:10:46.570 --> 00:10:51.530\nIf you are using some sort of holistic\nmanagement like Systems Center.\n\n210\n00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:56.460\nOr even in other shows I know we've talked\nabout on another Windows 10 show with\n\n211\n00:10:57.850 --> 00:10:59.690\nWindows analytics are.\n\n212\n00:10:59.690 --> 00:11:04.730\nI think specifically we were looking\nat upgrade readiness but same concept.\n\n213\n00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:07.190\nIt all goes together and it makes,\n\n214\n00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:12.620\nespecially if you're using like Windows\ndi or some kind of analytical platform.\n\n215\n00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:15.870\nIt's just adding all that little\nmetadata to help you analyze and\n\n216\n00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:19.100\nunderstand your business,\nyou know, in a holistic view there.\n\n217\n00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:21.544\nIt's really cool [INAUDIBLE].\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it really does help.\n\n218\n00:11:21.544 --> 00:11:23.740\nAll right, so I'm gonna choose\nAvailable for Enrolled Devices.\n\n219\n00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:26.110\nThat means they can assign,\nthey can install it if they want.\n\n220\n00:11:26.110 --> 00:11:27.330\nThey'll see it in their portal.\n\n221\n00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:29.760\nYou can also do required,\nwhich will just go ahead and\n\n222\n00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:31.970\ninstall or force them to install.\n\n223\n00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:33.780\nRight below that, no group selected.\n\n224\n00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:39.510\nI gonna click included groups, and\nthen I'm going to find the group I want.\n\n225\n00:11:39.510 --> 00:11:43.650\nYou can do 'make this app available\nto all users with enrolled devices.\n\n226\n00:11:43.650 --> 00:11:46.330\nThat we don't have to set up any groups or\nuse any groups.\n\n227\n00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:50.550\nIf this was an app that I wanted everybody\nin the company to be able to use,\n\n228\n00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:52.530\nthis will be the easiest way to go.\n\n229\n00:11:52.530 --> 00:11:55.590\nIf this is for\nselect people like just my hosts or\n\n230\n00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:58.780\njust my sales people,\nthen I wanna use groups.\n\n231\n00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:01.050\nNow these groups were set up,\nI set these up ahead of time.\n\n232\n00:12:01.050 --> 00:12:03.730\nThis is done through\nAzure Active Directory or\n\n233\n00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:06.890\nyour on-prem Active Directory if you're\ndoing a hybrid and you're syncing.\n\n234\n00:12:06.890 --> 00:12:08.499\nBut I'm gonna choose\nSelect groups to include.\n\n235\n00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:13.050\nAnd it'll give me a list of all\nthe groups I have available.\n\n236\n00:12:13.050 --> 00:12:14.980\nI'll choose my host group.\n\n237\n00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:18.230\nAnd I could definitely choose\nmore than one if I needed to.\n\n238\n00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:20.070\nAnd I'll click Select.\n\n239\n00:12:20.070 --> 00:12:24.680\nYou also have group to exclude\nthis is groups to include,\n\n240\n00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:27.270\nI'll go ahead and click okay.\n\n241\n00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:31.910\nThere are also excluded groups like\nif you wanted to push it out to\n\n242\n00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:34.310\neverybody except certain people.\n\n243\n00:12:34.310 --> 00:12:35.520\nYou can exclude groups and\n\n244\n00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:40.610\nyou can say everybody but the hosts\nare gonna be able to get this application.\n\n245\n00:12:40.610 --> 00:12:41.460\nI'll go ahead and click, okay.\n\n246\n00:12:42.910 --> 00:12:45.950\nAnd, then this is the weird\nlittle funky thing with Azure.\n\n247\n00:12:45.950 --> 00:12:48.240\nI clicked okay, if I come back here and\n\n248\n00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:51.220\nit will let me know if I close\nthe blade without saving it.\n\n249\n00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:54.190\nBut, I do need to click save,\nyou see how it's lit up.\n\n250\n00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:57.740\nThat tells me that it's available,\nright, that it needs to be saved.\n\n251\n00:12:57.740 --> 00:13:00.800\nOnce I click Save,\nyou'll see how the save kinda grays out.\n\n252\n00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:03.460\nIt's a good indicator that okay,\nyou've saved your work.\n\n253\n00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:05.610\nYou're not gonna lose anything if\nyou navigate away from this blade.\n\n254\n00:13:05.610 --> 00:13:06.140\n&gt;&gt; Well thank you for\n\n255\n00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:09.000\npointing that out because especially\nif you're new into Azure and\n\n256\n00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.350\ngetting into that habit.\n\n257\n00:13:10.350 --> 00:13:13.020\nBecause a lot of\nconfigurations are like that.\n\n258\n00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:15.930\nAnd you just, you know,\nmove off the page and then you lost it.\n\n259\n00:13:15.930 --> 00:13:16.940\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's easy to do.\n\n260\n00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:19.730\nAll right, so we'll go ahead and\nclose that blade down.\n\n261\n00:13:19.730 --> 00:13:22.900\nNow, I've got again this is the same\napp I deployed earlier when I\n\n262\n00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:23.770\nwas getting set up.\n\n263\n00:13:23.770 --> 00:13:25.800\nSo you see it actually listed here twice.\n\n264\n00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:28.280\nIt still says no for the assignment.\n\n265\n00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:30.740\nIf we refresh That should come back.\n\n266\n00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:32.510\nAnd there we go now it says, yes.\n\n267\n00:13:32.510 --> 00:13:34.700\nSo again,\nsomething to remember especially for\n\n268\n00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:38.490\nthe exam, is it's easy to get wrapped\nup in the details of what you're doing.\n\n269\n00:13:38.490 --> 00:13:40.000\nHey, we're gonna create a group.\n\n270\n00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.720\nAnd then we're gonna upload this package.\n\n271\n00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:43.670\nAnd we're gonna fill all\nthis information in.\n\n272\n00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:47.450\nWe're gonna pick the group, or\nwe're going to publish this application or\n\n273\n00:13:47.450 --> 00:13:48.360\nupload the application.\n\n274\n00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:52.300\nAnd we forget to actually assign\nthe application to anybody, and\n\n275\n00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:55.720\nyou wonder why it doesn't show\nup on your end user systems.\n\n276\n00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:57.220\nAnd because you forget to assign it.\n\n277\n00:13:57.220 --> 00:13:58.500\nEasy to do.\n\n278\n00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:00.990\nAll right, so let's see how that works.\n\n279\n00:14:00.990 --> 00:14:05.070\nI'm gonna log on, we'll pick on\nCherokee's account in this demo.\n\n280\n00:14:05.070 --> 00:14:07.625\nSo I guess I'm getting something\nout of it, like an app.\n\n281\n00:14:07.625 --> 00:14:08.780\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, hopefully, right,\n\n282\n00:14:08.780 --> 00:14:10.420\nif things go well.\n\n283\n00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:13.380\nSo we're going to,\nI've already installed it but\n\n284\n00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:16.260\nyour users could go out\nto the Microsoft store.\n\n285\n00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:20.610\nAnd install the company portal app or\nyou could provide this to them, right?\n\n286\n00:14:20.610 --> 00:14:24.330\nDistribute it through group policy or\nsystem center And\n\n287\n00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:26.080\nI'm gonna launch the company portal.\n\n288\n00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:28.460\nI've already run through this a couple of\ntimes just to make sure everything was\n\n289\n00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:29.310\nworking for the demo.\n\n290\n00:14:29.310 --> 00:14:31.860\nNormally your user would\nhave to authenticate first.\n\n291\n00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:37.030\nRight log in with their corporate\naccount that has access to Azure.\n\n292\n00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:38.920\nSo I've logged in as Cherokee and\n\n293\n00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:43.970\nthere's our demo one app that has\nbeen side loaded through Intune.\n\n294\n00:14:43.970 --> 00:14:47.700\nNow we've already installed this\napplication in a previous episode\n\n295\n00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:49.740\nusing DISM for all users.\n\n296\n00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:52.640\nSo when I click on this\nit's gonna see that and\n\n297\n00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:54.610\nit's gonna say that\nit's already installed.\n\n298\n00:14:54.610 --> 00:14:59.010\nBut if they hadn't installed it yet right\nif we hadn't done that previous demo.\n\n299\n00:14:59.010 --> 00:15:01.670\nAnd Cherokee could simply\nopen up the company portal,\n\n300\n00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:05.020\nclick install and install that app.\n&gt;&gt; One stop\n\n301\n00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:06.170\nshop.\n&gt;&gt; I like it.\n\n302\n00:15:06.170 --> 00:15:08.090\nSo that is installing apps.\n\n303\n00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:10.170\nAnd I, you know,\nI mentioned those categories.\n\n304\n00:15:10.170 --> 00:15:13.060\nOver here on the left there\nis an App Categories.\n\n305\n00:15:13.060 --> 00:15:16.660\nAnd if we had published dozens of apps,\nmade them available,\n\n306\n00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:18.210\nside loaded them this way.\n\n307\n00:15:18.210 --> 00:15:20.500\nThey could come in here and\nchoose a particular category.\n\n308\n00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:24.900\nAnd it would filter those\napps down by that category.\n\n309\n00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:28.000\nAll right, so\nthat's side loading through In Tune.\n\n310\n00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.910\nIf I want to take an app that's\nnot available in the store and\n\n311\n00:15:30.910 --> 00:15:34.060\npush it out through Microsoft In Tune.\n\n312\n00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:36.980\nThe next thing I wanna do is\nshow you how to deep link an app\n\n313\n00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:38.590\nusing Microsoft Intune.\n\n314\n00:15:38.590 --> 00:15:41.110\nDeep linking's a little bit\ndifferent than side loading.\n\n315\n00:15:41.110 --> 00:15:43.710\nIn side loading we have the source\nfiles for the application.\n\n316\n00:15:43.710 --> 00:15:45.720\nTypically it's something\nwe wrote ourselves right?\n\n317\n00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:48.410\nIt's a line of business application.\n\n318\n00:15:48.410 --> 00:15:52.850\nDeep linking is when I just\nneed to create a pointer right?\n\n319\n00:15:52.850 --> 00:15:55.423\nI want them to install\na particular application.\n\n320\n00:15:55.423 --> 00:15:57.563\nIt's available through\nthe Microsoft Store and\n\n321\n00:15:57.563 --> 00:16:00.391\nthat could be the normal store\nthat's available to the public.\n\n322\n00:16:00.391 --> 00:16:03.828\nIt could be The store for\nbusiness, store for education,\n\n323\n00:16:03.828 --> 00:16:06.152\nbut I wanna point them to the right app.\n\n324\n00:16:06.152 --> 00:16:09.865\nAnd we've all been in that situation\nwhere we, we try to tell somebody hey,\n\n325\n00:16:09.865 --> 00:16:12.313\ngo to this store and look for\nthis particular app.\n\n326\n00:16:12.313 --> 00:16:15.623\nAnd they do a search and they find\nseveral apps that are similar and\n\n327\n00:16:15.623 --> 00:16:17.862\nhard to pick the right one\n&gt;&gt; Different versioning or\n\n328\n00:16:17.862 --> 00:16:20.668\nsomething like that or if there's yeah,\nespecially like, slights and\n\n329\n00:16:20.668 --> 00:16:22.585\ndiscrepancies there.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, uh-huh.\n\n330\n00:16:22.585 --> 00:16:26.398\nSo let's, so\nwhat I wanna do is deep link that app so\n\n331\n00:16:26.398 --> 00:16:29.692\nthat I know they're getting the right app.\n\n332\n00:16:29.692 --> 00:16:32.815\nTo do this,\nI don't have the source files, right?\n\n333\n00:16:32.815 --> 00:16:35.560\nThis isn't side loading,\nI'm gonna point them to it.\n\n334\n00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:36.860\nSo I do need a pointer.\n\n335\n00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:39.960\nI need to make sure I can point them\nto the right app, and to do that,\n\n336\n00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:40.552\n&gt;&gt; Where do we get the pointer?\n\n337\n00:16:40.552 --> 00:16:41.098\n&gt;&gt; What's that?\n\n338\n00:16:41.098 --> 00:16:41.958\n&gt;&gt; Where do we get the pointer?\n\n339\n00:16:41.958 --> 00:16:43.827\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well we're just gonna browse\n\n340\n00:16:43.827 --> 00:16:46.730\nthrough the store through the web,\nand find it that way.\n\n341\n00:16:46.730 --> 00:16:53.651\nSo we'll go to the Microsoft store,\nUsing our web browser.\n\n342\n00:16:53.651 --> 00:16:58.376\nAnd then I'm gonna find a nice\nfree app that we can deep link.\n\n343\n00:16:58.376 --> 00:17:03.042\nSo I'm gonna choose software Windows apps.\n\n344\n00:17:03.042 --> 00:17:06.431\nAnd let's see what we can find [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Well do I get to pick it since it's\n\n345\n00:17:06.431 --> 00:17:08.407\ngoing to be on my account?\n&gt;&gt; Sure, what do you want?\n\n346\n00:17:08.407 --> 00:17:10.568\nLet's see if we can find,\nactually I tell you what,\n\n347\n00:17:10.568 --> 00:17:11.903\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n348\n00:17:11.903 --> 00:17:13.271\n&gt;&gt; Where is the,\n\n349\n00:17:14.297 --> 00:17:17.870\nwe want a nice free one here.\n&gt;&gt; What about Netflix?\n\n350\n00:17:17.870 --> 00:17:19.889\nSo I can be really productive at work.\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna say,\n\n351\n00:17:19.889 --> 00:17:22.306\nthat is not very work related, Cherokee.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n352\n00:17:22.306 --> 00:17:23.086\n&gt;&gt; But, or we can use Netflix\n\n353\n00:17:23.086 --> 00:17:24.250\nas an example.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n354\n00:17:24.250 --> 00:17:25.522\n&gt;&gt; All right, so what you would do is\n\n355\n00:17:25.522 --> 00:17:28.713\nyou would browse again like I've done\nhere, through your browser, to the store.\n\n356\n00:17:28.713 --> 00:17:33.483\nClick on the app, and once you're at this\npage, this URL right up here at the top,\n\n357\n00:17:33.483 --> 00:17:38.350\nthat's what I need, all right.\n&gt;&gt; So I'm gonna copy that entire URL.\n\n358\n00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:39.035\n&gt;&gt; Cool.\n\n359\n00:17:39.035 --> 00:17:41.797\n&gt;&gt; Now I'm gonna go over to my portal, and\n\n360\n00:17:41.797 --> 00:17:44.811\njust like we did when\nwe were side loading,\n\n361\n00:17:44.811 --> 00:17:49.855\nI'm gonna navigate in the in tune and\nthen mobile apps, and then apps.\n\n362\n00:17:52.653 --> 00:17:56.775\nAnd then we're gonna click Add,\nand this time for\n\n363\n00:17:56.775 --> 00:17:59.830\nApp type, I'll choose a store app.\n\n364\n00:17:59.830 --> 00:18:01.862\nAnd we'll do Windows instead\nof line of business.\n\n365\n00:18:01.862 --> 00:18:05.330\nBut you can see I can deploy apps for\nAndroid, iOS,\n\n366\n00:18:05.330 --> 00:18:08.243\nthe Windows Phone 8.1, Office Suite.\n\n367\n00:18:08.243 --> 00:18:13.596\nWe'll go ahead and choose Windows and\nthen I'm gonna click Configure.\n\n368\n00:18:13.596 --> 00:18:17.566\nWe'll give this a name.\n\n369\n00:18:17.566 --> 00:18:18.983\nI'll do Netflix.\n\n370\n00:18:18.983 --> 00:18:22.907\nDescription, unproductive.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n371\n00:18:22.907 --> 00:18:25.857\n&gt;&gt; No, what is it for?\n\n372\n00:18:25.857 --> 00:18:29.037\n&gt;&gt; Video streaming [LAUGH].\n\n373\n00:18:29.037 --> 00:18:31.058\n&gt;&gt; Streaming videos, all right?\n\n374\n00:18:31.058 --> 00:18:33.121\nPublisher, who is the publisher,\nwhat do we say?\n\n375\n00:18:33.121 --> 00:18:33.864\n&gt;&gt; I have no idea.\n\n376\n00:18:33.864 --> 00:18:34.990\n&gt;&gt; Yeah want to say, Netflix.\n\n377\n00:18:34.990 --> 00:18:37.649\nAnd in here, the Appstore URL,\n\n378\n00:18:37.649 --> 00:18:43.768\nthat's where I'm gonna paste the URL\nthat I just copied from my browser.\n\n379\n00:18:43.768 --> 00:18:47.519\nJust like with our side loading,\nI can choose a category.\n\n380\n00:18:47.519 --> 00:18:50.841\nDo they have a category for\nnon-productive?\n\n381\n00:18:50.841 --> 00:18:51.673\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Look,\n\n382\n00:18:51.673 --> 00:18:54.649\nthey have a productivity category.\n&gt;&gt; But we're not putting it there.\n\n383\n00:18:54.649 --> 00:18:55.347\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n384\n00:18:55.347 --> 00:18:57.299\n&gt;&gt; How about we just put it in Other apps,\n\n385\n00:18:57.299 --> 00:18:58.724\nhow about that?\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n386\n00:18:58.724 --> 00:18:59.304\n&gt;&gt; All right?\n\n387\n00:18:59.304 --> 00:19:02.143\nAnd then, display this as a featured\napp in the company portal,\n\n388\n00:19:02.143 --> 00:19:04.100\nI do want it to show up\nin the company portal.\n\n389\n00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:05.772\nMake it easier for them to find.\n\n390\n00:19:05.772 --> 00:19:09.153\nI don't know if I selected that when\nI was going through the one where\n\n391\n00:19:09.153 --> 00:19:10.764\nwe sideloaded through Intune.\n\n392\n00:19:10.764 --> 00:19:13.606\nBut that's a good one to check or\nto turn on, cuz it\n\n393\n00:19:13.606 --> 00:19:16.212\ndoes make it appear on that first page.\n&gt;&gt; I think you\n\n394\n00:19:16.212 --> 00:19:16.757\ndid, but,\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n395\n00:19:16.757 --> 00:19:18.594\nthey don't have to go\nto the categories and\n\n396\n00:19:18.594 --> 00:19:19.435\nsearch.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n397\n00:19:19.435 --> 00:19:20.434\n&gt;&gt; Hopefully, I did, if not-\n\n398\n00:19:20.434 --> 00:19:21.096\n&gt;&gt; I think so.\n\n399\n00:19:21.096 --> 00:19:22.445\n&gt;&gt; That's a good one to do, all right?\n\n400\n00:19:22.445 --> 00:19:26.102\nAnd then again, the Information URLs,\nPrivacy URLs, if you wanna fill those out.\n\n401\n00:19:26.102 --> 00:19:30.302\nOr any type of logo that you want\nto associate with that app, and\n\n402\n00:19:30.302 --> 00:19:31.814\nthen we'll click OK.\n\n403\n00:19:31.814 --> 00:19:36.698\nAnd then we'll click Add, and\nit'll go through the process\n\n404\n00:19:36.698 --> 00:19:40.730\nof creating that deep link for\nthat application.\n\n405\n00:19:40.730 --> 00:19:43.481\nAll right,\nit says it created it successfully,\n\n406\n00:19:43.481 --> 00:19:47.116\njust like when we were sideloading\nit though, we're not done.\n\n407\n00:19:47.116 --> 00:19:49.855\nIf we stop here,\nnobody gets the application.\n\n408\n00:19:49.855 --> 00:19:52.131\nIt doesn't actually show\nup in anybody's portal.\n\n409\n00:19:52.131 --> 00:19:55.916\nWe need to assign the application\nto at least one group.\n\n410\n00:19:55.916 --> 00:20:01.222\nSo let's do that, we'll click Assignments,\nand then Add group.\n\n411\n00:20:01.222 --> 00:20:05.169\nThen I'll hit our drop down list and\nwe'll choose available for\n\n412\n00:20:05.169 --> 00:20:08.459\nenrolled devices because\nthat's the only option for\n\n413\n00:20:08.459 --> 00:20:13.084\nMicrosoft store apps unlike the side\nloading in the line of business apps.\n\n414\n00:20:13.084 --> 00:20:18.010\nSo enable for available for enrolled\ndevices, and then include the groups,\n\n415\n00:20:18.010 --> 00:20:20.677\nI'm gonna choose that host group again.\n\n416\n00:20:20.677 --> 00:20:26.327\nI choose hosts we'll click select and\nthen OK,\n\n417\n00:20:26.327 --> 00:20:33.120\nand OK again and\nthen don't forget to save your changes.\n\n418\n00:20:35.257 --> 00:20:41.481\nOkay, and then I can close that blade,\nand now I've got Netflix being assigned.\n\n419\n00:20:41.481 --> 00:20:46.017\nNow remember, this doesn't refresh\nautomatically, it says assign no,\n\n420\n00:20:46.017 --> 00:20:49.258\nI wanna refresh,\nthis is just something I always do.\n\n421\n00:20:49.258 --> 00:20:53.564\nI always make sure this changes to Yes,\notherwise I need to fix something, or\n\n422\n00:20:53.564 --> 00:20:55.486\nI'm gonna be troubleshooting and\n\n423\n00:20:55.486 --> 00:20:59.674\nhave users calling up hey I heard you\npublished or made Netflix available.\n\n424\n00:20:59.674 --> 00:21:02.169\nI don't have it, I hate even saying that.\n\n425\n00:21:02.169 --> 00:21:03.807\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n426\n00:21:03.807 --> 00:21:05.513\n&gt;&gt; I don't do Netflix in your corporate\n\n427\n00:21:05.513 --> 00:21:08.161\nenvironment I guess unless\nit's part of your business.\n\n428\n00:21:08.161 --> 00:21:09.995\nAll right there we go.\n\n429\n00:21:09.995 --> 00:21:13.235\nLet's see,\nnow if we flip over to our machine,\n\n430\n00:21:13.235 --> 00:21:17.054\nour Windows 10 client,\nstill logged on as Cherokee.\n\n431\n00:21:17.054 --> 00:21:19.724\nI'm going to open up that company portal.\n\n432\n00:21:19.724 --> 00:21:23.172\nI've saved my credentials, otherwise\nI would have to authenticate again.\n\n433\n00:21:23.172 --> 00:21:29.234\nI go to my apps, and there we go,\nNetflix is sitting right there.\n\n434\n00:21:29.234 --> 00:21:32.810\nRemember when I clicked on demo one,\nit said to install.\n\n435\n00:21:32.810 --> 00:21:34.985\nOr in our cases had to reinstall,\n&gt;&gt; Reinstall\n\n436\n00:21:34.985 --> 00:21:36.541\n&gt;&gt; Because I already had it installed.\n\n437\n00:21:36.541 --> 00:21:40.636\nFor Netflix I remember this is\ndeep linking, I click it, and\n\n438\n00:21:40.636 --> 00:21:44.667\nit doesn't say install,\nit says View in Microsoft Store.\n\n439\n00:21:44.667 --> 00:21:49.122\nSo if I click that,\nthat takes me right to the page for\n\n440\n00:21:49.122 --> 00:21:51.969\nthat app in the Microsoft Store.\n\n441\n00:21:51.969 --> 00:21:56.543\nSo again the idea behind deep linking is\nnot to provide the application for them.\n\n442\n00:21:56.543 --> 00:22:00.247\nIt's to point them to the application so\nthat they can go install it.\n\n443\n00:22:00.247 --> 00:22:04.543\nYou might have a particular app\nyou want all your users to get.\n\n444\n00:22:04.543 --> 00:22:08.724\nThere's an app available in the Store\nfrom some third party, and you want all\n\n445\n00:22:08.724 --> 00:22:12.905\nyour users to start using that and you\nwanna make sure they get the right one and\n\n446\n00:22:12.905 --> 00:22:16.473\nif you just say hey go download and\ninstall this mark down editor.\n\n447\n00:22:16.473 --> 00:22:20.479\nThey're gonna search for markdown,\nthere's gonna be 30 apps that do that, and\n\n448\n00:22:20.479 --> 00:22:22.151\nthey don't know which one to get.\n\n449\n00:22:22.151 --> 00:22:24.658\nOr they're not gonna choose the right one,\neven if\n\n450\n00:22:24.658 --> 00:22:28.292\nyou describe it down to the tiniest\ndetail, they'll pick the wrong one.\n\n451\n00:22:28.292 --> 00:22:32.897\nBy deep linking it, I can point them\ndirectly to the app that I want them to\n\n452\n00:22:32.897 --> 00:22:36.160\ninstall, or\nto make available to them to install.\n\n453\n00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:39.794\nAnd she can simply click Get and\nshe would have that app, all right?\n\n454\n00:22:39.794 --> 00:22:42.904\nNow also understand that\nthat happened really quick.\n\n455\n00:22:42.904 --> 00:22:47.152\nI have seen the reason I have code\nwriter up here as well is because I set\n\n456\n00:22:47.152 --> 00:22:48.251\none up earlier and\n\n457\n00:22:48.251 --> 00:22:53.105\nit took probably five to ten minutes\nbefore it showed up in the company portal.\n\n458\n00:22:53.105 --> 00:22:56.181\nSo just keep that in mind and\nwe know this with the cloud, right?\n\n459\n00:22:56.181 --> 00:22:57.981\nEverything's not instant.\n\n460\n00:22:57.981 --> 00:23:02.208\nSo if you go out there and deep link an\napp, you open up the company portal, and\n\n461\n00:23:02.208 --> 00:23:03.391\nit doesn't show up.\n\n462\n00:23:03.391 --> 00:23:07.579\nGive it a few minutes to replicate\nthroughout Microsoft Cloud Infrastructure\n\n463\n00:23:07.579 --> 00:23:08.790\nbefore that shows up.\n\n464\n00:23:08.790 --> 00:23:14.660\nSo that is two other ways we can install\napps when we're dealing with store and\n\n465\n00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:15.663\ncloud apps.\n\n466\n00:23:15.663 --> 00:23:20.370\nWe can sideload apps, using Microsoft\nIntune where we upload the source code of\n\n467\n00:23:20.370 --> 00:23:22.898\nthe application to Intune or to Azure, and\n\n468\n00:23:22.898 --> 00:23:27.902\nthen our users connect through the company\nportal download those and install them.\n\n469\n00:23:27.902 --> 00:23:31.908\nOr we can deep link with Intune,\nwhich is where we're really just creating\n\n470\n00:23:31.908 --> 00:23:36.301\na pointer in the company portal to the\nparticular app that's already available in\n\n471\n00:23:36.301 --> 00:23:39.245\nthe Microsoft store that we\nwant our users to install.\n\n472\n00:23:39.245 --> 00:23:42.966\nPerfect Mike, thank you for taking the\ntime to show us ways we can go ahead and\n\n473\n00:23:42.966 --> 00:23:45.016\nset those end users up for success there.\n\n474\n00:23:45.016 --> 00:23:47.338\nBut we are out of time so let's sign out.\n\n475\n00:23:47.338 --> 00:23:49.869\nI've been your host Cherokee Boose.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n476\n00:23:49.869 --> 00:23:52.435\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n477\n00:23:52.435 --> 00:23:59.437\n[MUSIC]\n\n478\n00:23:59.437 --> 00:24:02.536\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

watching IT Pro TV.\n&gt;&gt; Welcome\n\n4\n00:00:13.395 --> 00:00:16.390\neveryone to your Configure Windows Devices\nSeries studying for the 70-697 exam.\n\n5\n00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:19.390\nI'm your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.230\nIn this episode we'll be taking a look\nat how to support authentication and\n\n7\n00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:24.370\nauthorization.\n\n8\n00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:27.690\nAnd of course, with us today in\nstudio we have Mister Mike Roderick.\n\n9\n00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:29.870\nHow's it going today Mike?\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic Cherokee,\n\n10\n00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:33.950\nexcited to be back as always and\none of my I think they're all my\n\n11\n00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:34.630\nfavorite, I don't know.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n12\n00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:35.550\n&gt;&gt; I say that every time though.\n\n13\n00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:36.810\n&gt;&gt; You do, you say it quite a bit.\n\n14\n00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:38.110\n&gt;&gt; I'm very excitable and\n\n15\n00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:41.560\nI love all of the topics that we\ntalk about, but hey passion about.\n\n16\n00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:42.360\n&gt;&gt; That's why you're here doing\n\n17\n00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:42.950\nthis.\n&gt;&gt; That's\n\n18\n00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:43.900\nright.\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n19\n00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.090\n&gt;&gt; So yeah, authentication and\n\n20\n00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.530\nauthorization is what\nwe're gonna be going over.\n\n21\n00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.881\nAnd really in the objectives,\nthey talk about identify and\n\n22\n00:00:51.881 --> 00:00:53.976\nresolve issues related to.\n\n23\n00:00:53.976 --> 00:00:56.386\nSo I wanna look at some different\nauthentication methods and\n\n24\n00:00:56.386 --> 00:00:58.852\njust make sure we're comfortable\nwith how we get them set up.\n\n25\n00:00:58.852 --> 00:01:01.293\nCuz usually when we're talking\nabout troubleshooting,\n\n26\n00:01:01.293 --> 00:01:03.940\nsomething has gone wrong or\nwe're just trying to get it set up.\n\n27\n00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.540\nSomebody comes in and they want to\nuse this feature on their laptop, and\n\n28\n00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.490\nI need to be familiar with it, so\nthat I can help them get that working.\n\n29\n00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.330\nSo, that's what we're going to do.\n\n30\n00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.180\nAnd, the first thing I wanna do, and\nI've probably said this another shows,\n\n31\n00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.160\nif you've watched them.\n\n32\n00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.310\nI wanna make sure we're\nall at the same page, and\n\n33\n00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.880\nunderstand we're talking about\nauthentication and authorization.\n\n34\n00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.600\nSome people will try to use those terms\ninterchangeably, and they're really not.\n\n35\n00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.917\nI wanna make sure we understand\nthe difference between them, for an exam,\n\n36\n00:01:33.917 --> 00:01:35.367\nwe may need to know that.\n\n37\n00:01:35.367 --> 00:01:38.703\nAnd when it comes to troubleshooting\nworking with these technologies,\n\n38\n00:01:38.703 --> 00:01:39.310\nit helps us.\n\n39\n00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:40.800\nBecause we know where to troubleshoot, or\n\n40\n00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:46.210\nwhat to look at, if we understand where\nthe failure or the problem is occurring.\n\n41\n00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.010\nSo authentication and authorization.\n\n42\n00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:53.040\nAuthentication is proving your identity,\nproving the identity of someone or\n\n43\n00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.780\nsomething.\n\n44\n00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.770\nIt could be a device, computers\nauthenticate, services authenticate,\n\n45\n00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.617\ndoesn't necessarily have to\nbe a user as we think of,\n\n46\n00:02:00.617 --> 00:02:02.410\nbut it's proving the identity.\n\n47\n00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:06.262\nWhen we login to our systems we type\nin our username and our password and\n\n48\n00:02:06.262 --> 00:02:08.950\nthat's verified against\nan account database.\n\n49\n00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:11.860\nAnd assuming we typed in the right\npassword, we're now authenticated.\n\n50\n00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.480\nYou must be Mike, because you typed in the\npassword that is correct for that account.\n\n51\n00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.290\nSo we have authenticated you,\nyou are Mike.\n\n52\n00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.760\nAuthorization, is giving you access or\n\n53\n00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:28.530\ndenying you access to resources,\nbased on who you are.\n\n54\n00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.640\nThat's authorization, yes Mike, you have\nthe right to sign on to this machine.\n\n55\n00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.520\nYes Mike,\nyou have the right to edit group policy.\n\n56\n00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.310\nNo Mike, you do not have the right\nto connect to this share,\n\n57\n00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:40.480\nthat's authorization.\n\n58\n00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.280\nAre you authorized to do this task,\nor not authorized.\n\n59\n00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:49.150\nBut authorization can only come\nafter successful authentication.\n\n60\n00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.150\nIf I don't know who you are,\nthen I can't tell you whether you can or\n\n61\n00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.578\ncan't do this job or this task or access\nthis resource, whatever the case may be.\n\n62\n00:02:56.578 --> 00:03:00.000\nSo understanding that, when we get into\nworking with these technologies and\n\n63\n00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.350\ntrouble shooting can help us.\n\n64\n00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:05.880\nCuz if auser's calling us up and saying,\nhey I can't get access to that share.\n\n65\n00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.490\nWell, what's happening?\n\n66\n00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:09.010\nWhat is it saying when you do this?\n\n67\n00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.100\nIt's saying wrong user name and password.\n\n68\n00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:15.037\nI'm not gonna go troubleshoot the share\npermissions, or the anti permissions,\n\n69\n00:03:15.037 --> 00:03:18.340\nbecause they haven't even made it\npast the authentication phase.\n\n70\n00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.070\nLet's make sure you authenticate properly\nfirs,t and then if we still have problems,\n\n71\n00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:24.770\nwe can say,\nwhy you don't have access to the resource.\n\n72\n00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:25.840\nSee what I'm saying?\n\n73\n00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:28.190\nJust wanted to get that out of the way,\n\n74\n00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:30.910\nmake sure we understand\nthe difference between the two.\n\n75\n00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:32.940\nNow, the first thing they\ncall out in the objectives,\n\n76\n00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.020\nthey talk about multifactor\nauthentication.\n\n77\n00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:37.330\nSo another little quick fact check here,\n\n78\n00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:40.420\nwhere we talk about\nmultifactor authentication.\n\n79\n00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:43.060\nWhat does that make you think of,\nCherokee, when I say multifactor?\n\n80\n00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:44.540\n&gt;&gt; Multi, more than one, right?\n\n81\n00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:45.270\n&gt;&gt; That's it.\n\n82\n00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:48.130\nI mean it can't get much easier,\nmultifactor.\n\n83\n00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:52.190\nWe're gonna base the authentication\nprocess on more than one factor\n\n84\n00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:53.630\nof authentication.\n\n85\n00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:56.504\nWe're used to maybe signing in\nwith a user name and password,\n\n86\n00:03:56.504 --> 00:03:58.618\nwhat we call single factor authentication.\n\n87\n00:03:58.618 --> 00:04:02.454\nBut we're seeing more and more people\nusing smart cards for example, where we\n\n88\n00:04:02.454 --> 00:04:06.363\nhave a certificate loaded up on there,\nand you have to apply that certificate.\n\n89\n00:04:06.363 --> 00:04:09.697\nSo you punch or\nput in your smart card into a reader, but\n\n90\n00:04:09.697 --> 00:04:13.992\nyou have to put the appropriate pin\nin as well, that's multi factor.\n\n91\n00:04:13.992 --> 00:04:19.268\nWe have two forms of authentication, so\nany combination of authentication factors,\n\n92\n00:04:19.268 --> 00:04:24.123\nremember when it comes to authentication\nwe can really base it on three things.\n\n93\n00:04:24.123 --> 00:04:27.796\nSomething you know, something you have,\nor something you are.\n\n94\n00:04:27.796 --> 00:04:33.266\nSomething you know might be a password,\nsomething you have would be like a smart\n\n95\n00:04:33.266 --> 00:04:38.860\ncard or a certificate, something you\nare is where we talk about biometrics.\n\n96\n00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:42.190\nSo, if we say we are going to\nrequire you to insert a password, or\n\n97\n00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:47.480\ntype a password in and do a fingerprint\nscan, that's multi-factor authentication.\n\n98\n00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:51.850\nJust in case they try to trick you,\nnot that Microsoft would ever do\n\n99\n00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:56.940\nthat on a exam, understand that inserting\ntwo passwords is not multifactored.\n\n100\n00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:01.430\nYou're still only using on factor of\nauthentication, something you know.\n\n101\n00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:04.620\nSo if you enter a password and\nit prompts you for a second password, not\n\n102\n00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:06.609\nthat I've ever seen any systems do that.\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n103\n00:05:06.609 --> 00:05:09.881\nand also I've seen where they\nsay user name and password.\n\n104\n00:05:09.881 --> 00:05:13.580\nAnd if you're going through really quick,\nand you see the and\n\n105\n00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:15.755\nsign and you're like multi, and.\n\n106\n00:05:15.755 --> 00:05:19.780\nThe way our brains think,\nit's no, user name and password,\n\n107\n00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:23.430\nstill only one form of authentication.\n&gt;&gt; That's a great point, exactly right.\n\n108\n00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:27.180\nSo just keep that in mind, think about\nwhat the three factors we use for\n\n109\n00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:28.480\nauthentication are, and\n\n110\n00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:32.650\nif we're using more than one of those\nthree factors, then we do a multifactor.\n\n111\n00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:36.040\nAnd multifactor could be two,\ncould be three, could be more.\n\n112\n00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:38.650\nI guess it can't be more,\nthere are only three, so.\n\n113\n00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:40.240\nBut anyway, it could be two or three.\n\n114\n00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:42.310\nDoesn't necessarily have to be two.\n\n115\n00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:46.200\nSo, that's what they mean by\nmultifactor authentication.\n\n116\n00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:49.020\nNow, typically,\nas I said a little bit ago,\n\n117\n00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:52.230\nprobably the most common form of\nmultifactor authentication used in Windows\n\n118\n00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:56.470\nsystems today, is the use of\nsmart cards and certificates.\n\n119\n00:05:56.470 --> 00:06:00.600\nBecause we can take these certificates to\na much stronger form of authentication,\n\n120\n00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:02.780\nbecause they're a little\nharder to tamper with.\n\n121\n00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:06.740\nThey're harder to fake,\nI can't guess them like I can a password.\n\n122\n00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:10.650\nSo that makes it a more secure\nform of authentication, And\n\n123\n00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:14.640\ntypically with smart cards,\nwe have a PIN associated with them.\n\n124\n00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:16.040\nA number, or\n\n125\n00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:20.360\nsome string of characters, that I\nneed to punch in along with the card.\n\n126\n00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:22.600\nSo having the card is not enough,\nand again,\n\n127\n00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:25.110\nthat's where that\nmultifactor comes into play.\n\n128\n00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:27.260\nSo if somebody steals my,\nif I leave my card laying around and\n\n129\n00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.510\nCherokee picks it up, she has my card.\n\n130\n00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:31.480\nShe might try to put it in a card reader,\nbut\n\n131\n00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:33.940\nshe doesn't know the PIN\nassociated with the card.\n\n132\n00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:35.520\nShe's not gonna be able to get access.\n\n133\n00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:38.628\nOr if she sees me typing my PIN,\nshe might learn my pin, but\n\n134\n00:06:38.628 --> 00:06:41.611\nif I keep my card secure,\nshe's not going to be able to go\n\n135\n00:06:41.611 --> 00:06:44.190\nget it out of the bank.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, and so that would be an example\n\n136\n00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:47.600\nof something you have, because you said\nthere were three different types, Mike.\n\n137\n00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:53.680\nAnd so, doesn't mean three different\ntypes like only just retina scan and\n\n138\n00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:56.800\nsmart card and certificate, that's\nthree right there, but three different\n\n139\n00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:59.090\ncategories that we have here.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, exactly.\n\n140\n00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:03.520\nIf you do a fingerprint scan and a retina\nscan, yes you are doing two different\n\n141\n00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:06.840\nthings to authenticate, but\nthey are both the same type.\n\n142\n00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:08.263\nThat's something you are,\n\n143\n00:07:08.263 --> 00:07:12.640\nthat's not considered multifactor\nin the strict definition of it.\n\n144\n00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:15.050\nAll right, so let's talk a little\nbit about certificates then.\n\n145\n00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:17.240\nCertificates are simply\nelectronic documents,\n\n146\n00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:20.560\nthat tie your identity to a key pair.\n\n147\n00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:23.930\nThat's the technical\ndefinition of these guys.\n\n148\n00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:28.200\nThey're issued by something known as CAs,\nor certificate authorities, and\n\n149\n00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:31.990\nthe certificate authority is part\nof something known as a PKI, or\n\n150\n00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:33.820\npublic key infrastructure.\n\n151\n00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:38.288\nMany corporation's enterprises run their\nown private PKI or public infrastructure,\n\n152\n00:07:38.288 --> 00:07:39.808\nin other words, in-house.\n\n153\n00:07:39.808 --> 00:07:43.225\nWe have a certificate authority,\nthat we can generate and\n\n154\n00:07:43.225 --> 00:07:47.075\nissue certificates to my users,\nto my computers, to software.\n\n155\n00:07:47.075 --> 00:07:51.980\nBut there's also public CAs like Verisign,\nand Thought, and Equifax, and GTE,\n\n156\n00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:56.886\nand all these other places, where I can go\nout and I can buy a certificate from them,\n\n157\n00:07:56.886 --> 00:07:58.525\nif I'm not running my own.\n\n158\n00:07:58.525 --> 00:08:02.198\nIn house PKI, there are some\ndifferences between the two and\n\n159\n00:08:02.198 --> 00:08:04.670\nwhen you should use one or the other.\n\n160\n00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:07.630\nWe talk about that much\nmore in our sever classes\n\n161\n00:08:07.630 --> 00:08:09.140\nwhen we look at certificate authority.\n\n162\n00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:14.040\nSo I'll let you go and watch those if\nyou wanna learn a little more about PKI.\n\n163\n00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:18.160\nWhen it comes to Windows 10 though,\nreally what we wanna\n\n164\n00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:21.510\nthink about are in this exam,\nwe wanna think about trouble shooting and\n\n165\n00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:25.250\nwhat kind of problems we might\nhave with our certificates.\n\n166\n00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:26.308\nWhy aren't they working,\n\n167\n00:08:26.308 --> 00:08:28.710\nwhy can't I authenticate with\nthe certificate, all right?\n\n168\n00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:34.076\nFirst thing to understand is that\ncertificates do expire depending on who's\n\n169\n00:08:34.076 --> 00:08:39.378\nissuing them, they might set up that\ncertificate to expire after one year.\n\n170\n00:08:39.378 --> 00:08:44.890\n2 years, 5 years, 20 years,\n99 years, give you anything but\n\n171\n00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:48.050\nthey do expire,\ntypically they are not permanent, right?\n\n172\n00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:52.950\nAnd usually, one, two, five years maybe\nfor certain certificates is usually what\n\n173\n00:08:52.950 --> 00:08:55.863\nwe're gonna see and\nthen you have to renew those.\n\n174\n00:08:55.863 --> 00:08:59.319\nWith an expired certificate much\nlike you're in the states and\n\n175\n00:08:59.319 --> 00:09:02.981\nan expired driver's license is\nnot a valid form authentication.\n\n176\n00:09:02.981 --> 00:09:06.993\nEven though everything on that\ncertificate is still valid,\n\n177\n00:09:06.993 --> 00:09:12.341\nright it's still my name, my email\naddress still hasn't changed, but because\n\n178\n00:09:12.341 --> 00:09:15.740\nit's expired we can't trust it any more.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, tell that to TSA.\n\n179\n00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:18.382\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] They will not take it,\n\n180\n00:09:18.382 --> 00:09:19.893\nI used to bar tend for a living,\n\n181\n00:09:19.893 --> 00:09:23.810\nand I had to tell people your driver's\nlicense is expired, I cant accept that.\n\n182\n00:09:23.810 --> 00:09:27.580\nMy birthday is not gonna change\nwhether my license is expired or not.\n\n183\n00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:31.946\nI know but if the alcohol beverage\ncontrol comes in and does an audit and\n\n184\n00:09:31.946 --> 00:09:36.019\nyou show them that, it's not gonna\nbe good for me or you, right?\n\n185\n00:09:36.019 --> 00:09:40.697\nSo yes, certificates do expire they\nare invalid once they expire, so\n\n186\n00:09:40.697 --> 00:09:42.058\nthey're renewed.\n\n187\n00:09:42.058 --> 00:09:46.376\nTypically we renew them before\nthey expire, is the key there.\n\n188\n00:09:46.376 --> 00:09:50.245\nSo that's one of the first things\nyou would look at is if you're using\n\n189\n00:09:50.245 --> 00:09:54.516\ncertificates as a form of authentication,\nhas that certificate expired or\n\n190\n00:09:54.516 --> 00:09:55.560\nbeen revoked?\n\n191\n00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:57.283\nBecause the certificate authority,\n\n192\n00:09:57.283 --> 00:10:00.955\nthe administrator of your public\ne-infrastructure can revoke certificates.\n\n193\n00:10:00.955 --> 00:10:04.040\nLet's say Cherokee\nleaves the organization,\n\n194\n00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:07.508\nwell that certificate that I\nissued to her is valid for\n\n195\n00:10:07.508 --> 00:10:12.670\nlet's say two years was the original\nlength of validity on that certificate.\n\n196\n00:10:12.670 --> 00:10:15.500\nAnd after a year we had to\nlet Cherokee go or she quit,\n\n197\n00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:18.790\nshe went on to greener pastures somewhere,\nright.\n\n198\n00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:20.639\nHopefully not don't leave us\nCherokee we love you here.\n\n199\n00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:26.460\nSo, what the problem is is that\nthe certificate that I issued her\n\n200\n00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:27.300\nis still valid.\n\n201\n00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:29.510\nEven though she's no longer\nwith the organization,\n\n202\n00:10:29.510 --> 00:10:34.010\nshe could have that certificate copied\nto a thumb drive, to another PC,\n\n203\n00:10:34.010 --> 00:10:38.770\non a smart card that she lost and\nthen found later.\n\n204\n00:10:38.770 --> 00:10:42.820\nWhat if she could still try to use that\ncertificate to maybe login to a system or\n\n205\n00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:46.270\nto access email or\nto VPN into the organization.\n\n206\n00:10:46.270 --> 00:10:49.930\nAnd so we will revoke certificates\nif we need them to be\n\n207\n00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:54.430\nunaccepted before their\nactual expiration date.\n\n208\n00:10:54.430 --> 00:10:58.331\nThat's another thing you wanna look at\nwith certificates is, is this still,\n\n209\n00:10:58.331 --> 00:11:00.828\nis it valid, and\nhas it been revoked, all right?\n\n210\n00:11:00.828 --> 00:11:05.341\nOther things we can have issues with\ncertificates are going to be making sure\n\n211\n00:11:05.341 --> 00:11:07.810\ncertificates are in the right location,\n\n212\n00:11:07.810 --> 00:11:11.380\nI'll come back to that thought\nhere in just a second.\n\n213\n00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:15.900\nAnd that the certificate authority that's\nissuing the certificates is trusted right.\n\n214\n00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:18.667\nIf you don't trust who is\ncreating the certificates,\n\n215\n00:11:18.667 --> 00:11:21.088\nthen you're not gonna\ntrust the certificate.\n\n216\n00:11:21.088 --> 00:11:24.865\nBecause the CA the certificate\nauthority is somebody going to it and\n\n217\n00:11:24.865 --> 00:11:26.464\nrequesting a certificate.\n\n218\n00:11:26.464 --> 00:11:29.765\nHey, I'm Mike,\nI want a certificate that proves who I am,\n\n219\n00:11:29.765 --> 00:11:33.924\nwell I have to some how verify that\ninformation I can't walk in and say hey,\n\n220\n00:11:33.924 --> 00:11:36.785\nI'm Bill Gates I want\na certificate that says I am.\n\n221\n00:11:36.785 --> 00:11:41.101\nNot you're not, right, so\nyou do have to prove your identity, and\n\n222\n00:11:41.101 --> 00:11:45.144\nwhen we accept these certificate\nas a form of authentication.\n\n223\n00:11:45.144 --> 00:11:49.649\nWe're trusting that whoever issued\nthis certificate did their job and\n\n224\n00:11:49.649 --> 00:11:53.865\nvalidated that information before\nthey issued the certificate.\n\n225\n00:11:53.865 --> 00:11:57.603\nSo we have to trust the certificate\nauthority that's doing the issuing,\n\n226\n00:11:57.603 --> 00:12:00.790\notherwise we're not gonna\ntrust those certificates.\n\n227\n00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:04.042\nAnd I'll show you the example\nof that in a second,\n\n228\n00:12:04.042 --> 00:12:08.689\nthey are stored on the local machine and\nwe have to deal with certificate\n\n229\n00:12:08.689 --> 00:12:12.730\nissued to users as well as\ncertificates issued to computers.\n\n230\n00:12:12.730 --> 00:12:15.875\nSo lets take a look at my screen here, and\nI have a certificate of authority pulled\n\n231\n00:12:15.875 --> 00:12:17.600\nup I just wanted to show\nyou this real quick.\n\n232\n00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:20.269\nI'm not gonna spend a lot\nof time here because again,\n\n233\n00:12:20.269 --> 00:12:24.358\nthis is more of the server side of things,\nbut this is my certificate authority and\n\n234\n00:12:24.358 --> 00:12:26.337\nI can issue all of these certificates.\n\n235\n00:12:26.337 --> 00:12:30.363\nAll my users and my computers, can\nthrough several different methods request\n\n236\n00:12:30.363 --> 00:12:32.875\ncertificates from\nthe certificate authority.\n\n237\n00:12:32.875 --> 00:12:36.571\nLike for a computer, or for a user or for\n\n238\n00:12:36.571 --> 00:12:41.388\na web server, or basic EFS,\nand things like that.\n\n239\n00:12:41.388 --> 00:12:45.070\nSo this is where they're gonna\nget those certificates from.\n\n240\n00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:47.406\nAnd I can look at this\ncertificate of authority and\n\n241\n00:12:47.406 --> 00:12:50.643\nI can see the different certificates\nthat have been issued by the CA.\n\n242\n00:12:50.643 --> 00:12:54.107\nI can also go into revoked certificates,\nI don't have any, but\n\n243\n00:12:54.107 --> 00:12:57.071\nif I had revoked a certificate,\nit would show up here.\n\n244\n00:12:57.071 --> 00:13:01.867\nSo this is where I may wanna check to see\nwow, is Mike's certificate been revoked,\n\n245\n00:13:01.867 --> 00:13:04.415\nis that why its not being accepted, right?\n\n246\n00:13:04.415 --> 00:13:08.356\nAll right, but let's go over to\nthe client side of things and\n\n247\n00:13:08.356 --> 00:13:10.922\nsee what we've got going on over here.\n\n248\n00:13:10.922 --> 00:13:14.206\nSo I got my Windows send machine it\nis part of the domain to work with\n\n249\n00:13:14.206 --> 00:13:15.104\ncertificates and\n\n250\n00:13:15.104 --> 00:13:18.300\nsee if we're troubleshooting\ncertificate identification.\n\n251\n00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:21.166\nWe're gonna need you to look at the\ncertificates that have been issued either\n\n252\n00:13:21.166 --> 00:13:22.149\nthe user or the computer.\n\n253\n00:13:22.149 --> 00:13:27.411\nCert manager is the tool we're gonna use,\nyou can type in cert mgr but\n\n254\n00:13:27.411 --> 00:13:32.580\nas you can see as I start typing cert\ndown here in my start menu I can see\n\n255\n00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:38.850\nmanage user certificates,\nI also have manage computer certificates.\n\n256\n00:13:38.850 --> 00:13:43.058\nLet's take a look at my user certificates,\ncould also create a custom mmc and\n\n257\n00:13:43.058 --> 00:13:46.243\nadd your certificates snap in and\nwork with them that way.\n\n258\n00:13:46.243 --> 00:13:51.275\nSo when I come in certificates I can\nexpand that personal I can go down\n\n259\n00:13:51.275 --> 00:13:57.296\nto certificates, and I can see here's\na certificate issued to my user account.\n\n260\n00:13:57.296 --> 00:14:03.294\nI double click on it, I can see this\ncertificate, proves your identity,\n\n261\n00:14:03.294 --> 00:14:09.020\nprotects email messages,\nallows data on discs to be encrypted.\n\n262\n00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:14.200\nSo this particular certificate is good for\nEFS, for digitally signing emails, and\n\n263\n00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:19.050\nfor authenticating, right, proves your\nidentity to a remote computer, all right.\n\n264\n00:14:19.050 --> 00:14:24.206\nIf we go over to the certification path,\nwe'll see that this certificate\n\n265\n00:14:24.206 --> 00:14:29.990\nMike Rodrick is it, you barely see that\nit's chained up to root CA, right?\n\n266\n00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:33.882\nAnd remember what I said that's the CA\nthat does the issuing has to be trusted.\n\n267\n00:14:33.882 --> 00:14:38.772\nOr root CA in my case is the name of the\ncertificate authority that has issued me\n\n268\n00:14:38.772 --> 00:14:39.986\nthe certificate.\n\n269\n00:14:39.986 --> 00:14:42.793\nSo I need to trust that certificate or\n\n270\n00:14:42.793 --> 00:14:46.426\nthat CA before I can\ntrust these certificates.\n\n271\n00:14:46.426 --> 00:14:52.546\nIf I try to use my certificate,\nmaybe I try to log onto a remote machine,\n\n272\n00:14:52.546 --> 00:14:57.952\nif that remote machine doesn't\ntrust root CA then its not gonna\n\n273\n00:14:57.952 --> 00:15:05.200\ntrust Mike Roderick because it doesn't\ntrust the issuing certificate authority.\n\n274\n00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:08.826\nNow if we look, we have a note,\n\n275\n00:15:08.826 --> 00:15:11.882\na noted called trusted route\ncertification authorities.\n\n276\n00:15:11.882 --> 00:15:13.505\nIf I click on certificates,\n\n277\n00:15:13.505 --> 00:15:18.540\nyou'll see theres a whole list of\ntrusted route certification authorities.\n\n278\n00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:22.320\nOne of them being route CA, the same\nserver we were just looking at, the one\n\n279\n00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:26.357\nthat issued that Mike Broderick, but\nwhat about all these other ones, right?\n\n280\n00:15:26.357 --> 00:15:31.616\nThese are those public CAs,\nplaces like GlobalSign, GoDaddy,\n\n281\n00:15:31.616 --> 00:15:38.033\nwhere there's Thawte, Equifax,\na couple that I mentioned earlier, right?\n\n282\n00:15:38.033 --> 00:15:41.874\nThese are public Certificate Authorities,\nand\n\n283\n00:15:41.874 --> 00:15:47.774\nthis is why it all just works like when\nwe go to a secure website like Amazon or\n\n284\n00:15:47.774 --> 00:15:50.508\nNewegg, or something like that.\n\n285\n00:15:50.508 --> 00:15:52.869\nWell, who issued that\ncertificate to Amazon?\n\n286\n00:15:52.869 --> 00:15:58.578\nI don't know, but my computer does,\nmy computer knows to trust That website.\n\n287\n00:15:58.578 --> 00:15:59.104\nIn fact, you know what?\n\n288\n00:15:59.104 --> 00:16:00.725\nWe can do and experiment here.\n\n289\n00:16:00.725 --> 00:16:02.710\nLet's open up a browser.\n\n290\n00:16:02.710 --> 00:16:06.702\nAnd let's go to Newegg.com.\n\n291\n00:16:06.702 --> 00:16:09.700\nIt's a secure site,\nfeel I can do shopping here.\n\n292\n00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:13.660\nIf I click on my little lock, I can\nget information about the certificate.\n\n293\n00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:17.090\nDigiCert has identified\nthis site as newegg.com.\n\n294\n00:16:17.090 --> 00:16:19.070\nShould I trust this site?\n\n295\n00:16:19.070 --> 00:16:25.630\nSo DigiCert is the organization that-\n&gt;&gt; They're responsible for\n\n296\n00:16:25.630 --> 00:16:30.360\nverifying and authenticating the person\napplying for that certificate.\n\n297\n00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:30.890\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and\n\n298\n00:16:30.890 --> 00:16:34.010\nthen they turn around and\nissue it assuming everything checks out.\n\n299\n00:16:34.010 --> 00:16:36.780\nSo if I come back over here\nto my Windows 10 machine,\n\n300\n00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:38.950\nwhy does my computer\ntrust the certificate?\n\n301\n00:16:38.950 --> 00:16:42.140\nWhy does it allow me to setup\nthe secured connection?\n\n302\n00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:44.930\nI've never done anything\nwith Digicert before.\n\n303\n00:16:44.930 --> 00:16:48.043\nOr my browser has a list,\nI shouldn't say my browser, my Windows 10.\n\n304\n00:16:48.043 --> 00:16:49.550\nLook right here.\n\n305\n00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:52.650\nDigicert is listed,\nin fact there different Digicert.\n\n306\n00:16:52.650 --> 00:16:56.050\nCertificates are listed\nhere in my trusted root.\n\n307\n00:16:56.050 --> 00:16:59.650\nSo that's why I trust those certificates.\n\n308\n00:16:59.650 --> 00:17:02.460\nSo in an organization,\nlet's say your using certificates, and\n\n309\n00:17:02.460 --> 00:17:04.940\nyour user brings in a laptop and\n\n310\n00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:09.230\nthey're trying to use their certificate\nto authenticate and they can't.\n\n311\n00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:12.030\nYou can go into their laptop and\nyou can look at their trusted roots and\n\n312\n00:17:12.030 --> 00:17:15.230\nverify, if you're issuing\ncertificates in house,\n\n313\n00:17:15.230 --> 00:17:20.010\nmake sure your company CA shows\nup in the list of trusted roots.\n\n314\n00:17:20.010 --> 00:17:22.730\nIf it doesn't, they're never\ngoing to trust that certificate.\n\n315\n00:17:22.730 --> 00:17:23.851\nSo you can export,\n\n316\n00:17:23.851 --> 00:17:28.908\ntypically we'll do this using group policy\nwe'll push out the root CA certificate.\n\n317\n00:17:28.908 --> 00:17:33.140\nSo that all the machines that are part of\nmy domain will automatically trust this.\n\n318\n00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:36.420\nBut if it's their BYOD type device,\n\n319\n00:17:36.420 --> 00:17:40.410\nyou might have to manually install that\nroot CA certificate, so that it trusts\n\n320\n00:17:40.410 --> 00:17:45.340\nthe certificates that that certificate\nauthority or PKI has issued, all right?\n\n321\n00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:48.790\nTo install a certificate, it's really\na pretty straightforward process.\n\n322\n00:17:48.790 --> 00:17:53.380\nI'm gonna minimize this, I'll close my\nbrowser, gonna open up File Explorer.\n\n323\n00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:56.420\nAnd I've got a certificate here,\ncalled Code Signing.\n\n324\n00:17:56.420 --> 00:18:00.140\nIt's a certificate that I was using,\nI was playing around with signing apps.\n\n325\n00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:03.270\nTo install a certificate, you simply\ndouble-click on it to open it up,\n\n326\n00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:06.730\nyou can right click also and\nchoose install certificate.\n\n327\n00:18:06.730 --> 00:18:09.690\nI like to double-click, because I\nwant to read a little bit about it\n\n328\n00:18:09.690 --> 00:18:12.970\nbefore I just go blindly\ninstalling certificates.\n\n329\n00:18:12.970 --> 00:18:15.736\nAnd I can see it was issued to Michael,\nissued by Michael.\n\n330\n00:18:15.736 --> 00:18:16.536\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n331\n00:18:16.536 --> 00:18:17.360\n&gt;&gt; That's odd, yeah.\n\n332\n00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:19.430\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You trust yourself,\n\n333\n00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:22.020\ndon't you?\n&gt;&gt; I don't think I'm gonna show up in that\n\n334\n00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:24.480\nlist of trusted roots, what do you think?\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n335\n00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:25.440\n&gt;&gt; Probably not,\n\n336\n00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:26.460\nbut we'll come back to that.\n\n337\n00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:28.987\nThis is what's called\na self-signed certificate, in fact,\n\n338\n00:18:28.987 --> 00:18:32.191\nif we look at the certification path,\nyou'll see there really isn't a chain.\n\n339\n00:18:32.191 --> 00:18:37.595\nIt doesn't chain back up, but it's a good\nexample of untrusted certificates and\n\n340\n00:18:37.595 --> 00:18:41.290\nhow I can trust them if I truly\ndo trust them, all right?\n\n341\n00:18:41.290 --> 00:18:44.520\nAnd you can see down here,\nthis CA root certificate is not trusted,\n\n342\n00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:49.310\nbecause it is not in the trusted\nroot certification authority store.\n\n343\n00:18:49.310 --> 00:18:52.980\nOkay, well,\nlet's go ahead install the certificate.\n\n344\n00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:57.814\nSo when I click install, so, by the way,\nthere is the validity period,\n\n345\n00:18:57.814 --> 00:19:01.636\nFebruary 1st, 2018 to February 1st, 2019.\n\n346\n00:19:01.636 --> 00:19:03.940\nAll right,\nI'm gonna click install certificate.\n\n347\n00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:07.770\nIt's gonna launch by wizard and\ndepending it this is a user certificate or\n\n348\n00:19:07.770 --> 00:19:10.850\na computer certificate,\nI can chose which one.\n\n349\n00:19:10.850 --> 00:19:12.300\nI'm gonna go with user.\n\n350\n00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:16.158\nI'll click Next, and\nthen the default is to automatically\n\n351\n00:19:16.158 --> 00:19:20.336\nselect the certificate store\nbased on the type of certificate.\n\n352\n00:19:20.336 --> 00:19:23.970\n90% of the time maybe this will be fine,\nand I'm just guessing at the number.\n\n353\n00:19:23.970 --> 00:19:26.872\nI don't now many,\nwhat the actual percentage is, but\n\n354\n00:19:26.872 --> 00:19:28.711\nmost of the time this will be okay.\n\n355\n00:19:28.711 --> 00:19:31.558\nYou can leave it on automatic,\nwe'll click Next and\n\n356\n00:19:31.558 --> 00:19:34.310\nautomatically determined by the wizard.\n\n357\n00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:36.590\nFine, all right, I'll click Finish.\n\n358\n00:19:36.590 --> 00:19:37.750\nAnd import was successful.\n\n359\n00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:40.100\nI click OK and OK.\n\n360\n00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:45.280\nNow when I look at that certificate,\nno, it's still not trusted.\n\n361\n00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:45.880\nWhat happened?\n\n362\n00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:50.980\nLet's go see where it ended\nup putting that certificate.\n\n363\n00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:58.810\nIf we refresh my trusted root, let's just\nrefresh this whole console, Alright.\n\n364\n00:19:58.810 --> 00:20:03.423\nI don't see a certificate\nissued to Michael in here.\n\n365\n00:20:03.423 --> 00:20:05.903\nWell, there's my first problem, probably.\n\n366\n00:20:05.903 --> 00:20:09.640\nIf we find it,\nit actually shows up over here.\n\n367\n00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:12.620\nAll right,\nintermediate certification authorities.\n\n368\n00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:14.550\nSo it's not part of my trusted root.\n\n369\n00:20:14.550 --> 00:20:17.110\nIt's not going to be trusted.\n\n370\n00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:17.720\nSo how do I?\n\n371\n00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:19.510\nLet's say, like in my example,\n\n372\n00:20:19.510 --> 00:20:22.590\nthis is a legitimate certificate\nthat I want to trust.\n\n373\n00:20:22.590 --> 00:20:25.100\nThis was created for\nme when I was using my,\n\n374\n00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:29.710\nI think I was playing out with\nMicrosoft's Code Writer, but\n\n375\n00:20:29.710 --> 00:20:33.640\nI needed a certificate to sign\nan app I was trying to create and\n\n376\n00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:36.750\nget installed on Windows 10, so\nI issued my own certificate.\n\n377\n00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:37.680\nI trust it, right,\n\n378\n00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:39.340\nI know I'm me, most of the time.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n379\n00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:40.090\n&gt;&gt; Most of the time.\n\n380\n00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:42.063\n&gt;&gt; That's what,\n\n381\n00:20:42.063 --> 00:20:45.720\nyou've already figured out who you are,\ngood self-identity there, Mike [LAUGH]\n\n382\n00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:46.578\n&gt;&gt; It's good, though, right?\n\n383\n00:20:46.578 --> 00:20:50.062\nAll right, so let's go back over\nto where that certificate is,\n\n384\n00:20:50.062 --> 00:20:52.256\nI'm gonna double click on it again, and\n\n385\n00:20:52.256 --> 00:20:55.946\nI'm gonna choose to install\nthe certificate for the current user.\n\n386\n00:20:55.946 --> 00:20:59.428\nBut this time I'm going to tell it where\nto put it rather than let Windows,\n\n387\n00:20:59.428 --> 00:21:01.600\nbecause here's what's happening.\n\n388\n00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:03.520\nWindow's is looking at that\ncertificate and going,\n\n389\n00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:06.360\nMichael, I don't know who\nthis Michael issuer is.\n\n390\n00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:08.640\nIt's not gonna put it in my trusted root,\nright?\n\n391\n00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:10.190\nIt doesn't trust the certificate.\n\n392\n00:21:10.190 --> 00:21:13.520\nSo it's either going to end up in that\nintermediate which is kind of a no man's\n\n393\n00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:14.510\nland there.\n\n394\n00:21:14.510 --> 00:21:17.400\nOr it could end up in untrusted, right?\n\n395\n00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:22.640\nSo I'm gonna tell it place the certificate\nin the following store of browse,\n\n396\n00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:25.550\nand I'll choose trusted root\ncertification authorities.\n\n397\n00:21:25.550 --> 00:21:29.120\nI'll click OK, and Next, and Finish.\n\n398\n00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:30.430\nAnd it's gonna warn me.\n\n399\n00:21:30.430 --> 00:21:34.090\nIt's gonna say, hey, look, we looked at\nthe certificate, I don't know who this is.\n\n400\n00:21:34.090 --> 00:21:36.330\nAre you really sure you wanna trust it?\n\n401\n00:21:36.330 --> 00:21:40.030\nHere's what you have to keep in mind,\nonce you trust the root certificate,\n\n402\n00:21:40.030 --> 00:21:42.960\nthe CA certificate,\nthe one that's doing all the issuing,\n\n403\n00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:47.030\nyou now trust every certificate that,\nthat CA is issuing.\n\n404\n00:21:47.030 --> 00:21:49.970\nIt's not that I trust this one or\nthat one but not that one,\n\n405\n00:21:49.970 --> 00:21:53.340\nyou trust the top of the hierarchy,\nyou trust everything underneath it.\n\n406\n00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:55.949\nSo it's telling you,\nif you don't trust that CA.\n\n407\n00:21:55.949 --> 00:21:59.967\nBecause let's say I did trust the CA and\nthen that CA turned around and\n\n408\n00:21:59.967 --> 00:22:02.800\nstarted doing something bad, all right?\n\n409\n00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:04.770\nWell, it's too late,\nmy system already trusted.\n\n410\n00:22:04.770 --> 00:22:09.020\nSo any certificates that CA issues\nare automatically gonna be trusted.\n\n411\n00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:12.680\nSo you wanna think twice before you\nadd something to your trusted root.\n\n412\n00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:17.781\nBut if you do trust it, like I do here,\nI click Yes and OK, and then OK.\n\n413\n00:22:17.781 --> 00:22:22.681\nAnd now when I open up that\ncertificate again, are you there,\n\n414\n00:22:22.681 --> 00:22:27.578\nnotice there's no big red X on it,\nif we go over to my console,\n\n415\n00:22:27.578 --> 00:22:32.667\nand I take a look at my trusted\nroot certification authorities,\n\n416\n00:22:32.667 --> 00:22:36.340\nand we do a little refresh.\n&gt;&gt; There you are.\n\n417\n00:22:36.340 --> 00:22:38.949\n&gt;&gt; I know, I'm now a trusted root.\n\n418\n00:22:38.949 --> 00:22:40.392\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH].\n\n419\n00:22:40.392 --> 00:22:41.324\n&gt;&gt; Right, [LAUGH] but\n\n420\n00:22:41.324 --> 00:22:45.489\nthat's something as we're trouble shooting\nwe need to understand the way this\n\n421\n00:22:45.489 --> 00:22:46.610\nprocess works.\n\n422\n00:22:46.610 --> 00:22:50.079\nWe have to look at a certificate and\nif it's saying that it's not trusted,\n\n423\n00:22:50.079 --> 00:22:51.191\nwhy isn't it trusted?\n\n424\n00:22:51.191 --> 00:22:53.123\nWell, because the root isn't trusted or\n\n425\n00:22:53.123 --> 00:22:56.090\nthe CA that issued\nthe certificate isn't entrusted.\n\n426\n00:22:56.090 --> 00:22:59.310\nThen, we have to determine\nshould that CAB trust it.\n\n427\n00:22:59.310 --> 00:23:03.120\nIf it's something like this, a self-signed\ncertificate for my developers, yeah,\n\n428\n00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:04.500\nI can go ahead and trust it.\n\n429\n00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:08.410\nOr, if it's my company's public key\ninfrastructure, maybe group policy hasn't\n\n430\n00:23:08.410 --> 00:23:12.210\napplied or, somebody set up the policy\nincorrectly, and somehow I was filtered\n\n431\n00:23:12.210 --> 00:23:16.500\nout of the policy that made my computer\ntrust our own public key infrastructure.\n\n432\n00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:19.330\nOr to BYOD device that's not\ngetting group policies, so\n\n433\n00:23:19.330 --> 00:23:25.110\nI'm gonna have manually add that company\nCA certificate to that trusted group.\n\n434\n00:23:25.110 --> 00:23:30.550\nThese are all things we gotta think about\nwhen we look at working with certificates.\n\n435\n00:23:30.550 --> 00:23:33.490\nAll right, Cherokee, I know we're getting\nshort on time we're getting ready to\n\n436\n00:23:33.490 --> 00:23:35.680\ngo into biometrics, but there's no way.\n\n437\n00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:38.490\nI'm gonna squeeze that in the way I\ntalk in the next couple of minutes, so\n\n438\n00:23:38.490 --> 00:23:41.560\nhow about we start there do a part 2?\n&gt;&gt; All right, sounds like a plan, Mike,\n\n439\n00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:44.160\nthank you for your time today and\nthank you for your time as well but for\n\n440\n00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:47.060\nnow let's go ahead and sign out,\nI've been your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n441\n00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:48.080\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n442\n00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:49.685\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITPro.TV.\n\n443\n00:23:49.685 --> 00:23:57.310\n[MUSIC]\n\n444\n00:23:57.310 --> 00:24:00.175\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPro.TV.\n\n",

00:00:08.158\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.158 --> 00:00:13.165\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV\n&gt;&gt; Welcome, everyone,\n\n5\n00:00:13.165 --> 00:00:17.868\nto your configuring Windows devices\nseries studying for the 70-697 exam.\n\n6\n00:00:17.868 --> 00:00:20.648\nI'm your host, Cherokee Boose,\nin this episode,\n\n7\n00:00:20.648 --> 00:00:25.145\nwe'll continue taking a look at how to\nsupport authentication and authorization.\n\n8\n00:00:25.145 --> 00:00:29.044\nWith us today back in studios, we have Mr.\nMike Rodrick, how's it going, Mike?\n\n9\n00:00:29.044 --> 00:00:30.645\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic, Cherokee,\nthanks for having me back.\n\n10\n00:00:30.645 --> 00:00:31.285\nHow are you doing today?\n\n11\n00:00:31.285 --> 00:00:33.620\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing wonderful, thank you, yeah.\n\n12\n00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:35.950\nI'm actually really excited\nabout this episode.\n\n13\n00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:38.210\nYou even got to buy a brand new toy for\nthis show.\n\n14\n00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:38.936\n&gt;&gt; Two new toys, actually.\n\n15\n00:00:38.936 --> 00:00:39.802\n&gt;&gt; Two new toys?\n\n16\n00:00:39.802 --> 00:00:44.240\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I know, love it when they\nbuy things for us here at ITProTV.\n\n17\n00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.020\nYeah, so we're gonna talk about\nbiometrics in this episode.\n\n18\n00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:49.350\nSo we did get a couple new\ntoys that I get to show you,\n\n19\n00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.170\nbecause we wanna play around with\nsomething known as Windows Hello.\n\n20\n00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.564\nAll right, but before we get there,\nlet's back up just a step and\n\n21\n00:00:56.564 --> 00:00:58.430\ntalk about biometrics in general.\n\n22\n00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:00.927\nIn our previous episode,\nwe talked about authentication.\n\n23\n00:01:00.927 --> 00:01:04.378\nWe talked about the three things\nwe could use for authentication,\n\n24\n00:01:04.378 --> 00:01:05.678\njust a real quick recap.\n\n25\n00:01:05.678 --> 00:01:08.471\nIf you want more about that,\nmake sure you go check out security plus.\n\n26\n00:01:08.471 --> 00:01:11.657\nBut something you know,\nsomething you have, something you are, and\n\n27\n00:01:11.657 --> 00:01:13.444\nbiometrics is that something you are.\n\n28\n00:01:13.444 --> 00:01:16.768\nRight, biometrics,\nmetrics based on life, right, bio,\n\n29\n00:01:16.768 --> 00:01:18.930\nI don't know my word etymology, but.\n\n30\n00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.433\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; When we talk about biometrics,\n\n31\n00:01:22.433 --> 00:01:26.930\nwe're talking about fingerprints or\nvoiceprints, or\n\n32\n00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:30.863\nretina scans or iris scans,\nor vascular scans.\n\n33\n00:01:30.863 --> 00:01:34.850\nI mean, they've got some really\ninteresting ones coming down the pipe.\n\n34\n00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.632\nSome of these, you've probably\nused yourself or played with or\n\n35\n00:01:37.632 --> 00:01:38.720\nseen in movies, right?\n\n36\n00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.719\n[LAUGH] Sometimes the movies take\na little bit of liberties with these, but\n\n37\n00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:44.600\nyeah, these are all biometrics.\n\n38\n00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.616\nAnd the cool thing about biometrics is,\nit's me.\n\n39\n00:01:47.616 --> 00:01:52.017\nI can't leave my fingerprint at\nhome like I can with a smart card.\n\n40\n00:01:52.017 --> 00:01:55.451\nYou roll into work, hey boss,\nlisten, I wanna log in, but\n\n41\n00:01:55.451 --> 00:01:57.114\nI left my smart card at home.\n\n42\n00:01:57.114 --> 00:01:59.781\n&gt;&gt; [SOUND] [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and then what do you do,\n\n43\n00:01:59.781 --> 00:02:02.773\ndo you send them home to get their\nsmart card if they live an hour away?\n\n44\n00:02:02.773 --> 00:02:06.627\nOr do you set up your system so\nthey can log on without the smart card?\n\n45\n00:02:06.627 --> 00:02:09.396\nOr do you issue them a new card and\n\n46\n00:02:09.396 --> 00:02:13.613\ninvalidate the other one,\nwhat a pain, right?\n\n47\n00:02:13.613 --> 00:02:16.484\nBiometrics is cool because\nit is based on who I am.\n\n48\n00:02:16.484 --> 00:02:18.846\nI bring my fingerprints\nwith me everywhere I go.\n\n49\n00:02:18.846 --> 00:02:22.293\nDownside is, I do leave my\nfingerprints everywhere I go, so\n\n50\n00:02:22.293 --> 00:02:23.992\npeople can get a hold of them.\n\n51\n00:02:23.992 --> 00:02:28.514\nSo a lot of it is based on how good\nthe technology is, that's another story.\n\n52\n00:02:28.514 --> 00:02:30.518\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I will-\n&gt;&gt; No no, say it.\n\n53\n00:02:30.518 --> 00:02:34.824\n&gt;&gt; No, I saw something that was really\ncool one time about subconscious type\n\n54\n00:02:34.824 --> 00:02:35.941\nauthentication.\n\n55\n00:02:35.941 --> 00:02:41.089\nWhere they actually maybe have you play\na game or a chord on a digital keyboard,\n\n56\n00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:44.607\nkind of like one with those video games or\nsomething.\n\n57\n00:02:44.607 --> 00:02:50.265\nAnd even your cadence, error rate,\nvery similar to even like keyboard\n\n58\n00:02:50.265 --> 00:02:55.660\ntypes of maybe heuristics based\nspecifically to that individual.\n\n59\n00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:58.030\nBut I think that's cool because\nif you don't know the password,\n\n60\n00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:59.116\nyou can't share it, right?\n\n61\n00:02:59.116 --> 00:03:01.658\n&gt;&gt; That's right, and\nI've seen things like that,\n\n62\n00:03:01.658 --> 00:03:05.106\nwhere based on your typing patterns,\nhow hard you hit the letters or\n\n63\n00:03:05.106 --> 00:03:08.450\ndifferent letters,\ndifferent strengths and things like that.\n\n64\n00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.560\nIt's amazing what the really smart people\nout there are trying to figure out,\n\n65\n00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:13.189\nall right.\n\n66\n00:03:13.189 --> 00:03:16.796\nI like the whole vascular one where it's,\nyou put your hand in a box, and\n\n67\n00:03:16.796 --> 00:03:20.129\nit's actually looking at your\nblood vessel pattern in your hand.\n\n68\n00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:22.105\nWhich is just as unique as a fingerprint,\nand\n\n69\n00:03:22.105 --> 00:03:24.033\nyou don't leave it laying around, right?\n\n70\n00:03:24.033 --> 00:03:25.508\nEverything you touch\ndoesn't leave that pattern.\n\n71\n00:03:25.508 --> 00:03:28.776\n&gt;&gt; And you can't, well,\nI guess without getting too graphic, but\n\n72\n00:03:28.776 --> 00:03:29.971\nI can't take a finger.\n\n73\n00:03:29.971 --> 00:03:34.634\n&gt;&gt; Borrow my hand, right, like we see\nin the movies with the iris scan and\n\n74\n00:03:34.634 --> 00:03:39.078\nthe retina scan and things like that,\nso creepy stuff, but yeah.\n\n75\n00:03:39.078 --> 00:03:44.643\nExactly, another one is the distance\nbetween your joints in your fingers.\n\n76\n00:03:44.643 --> 00:03:47.629\nYou slide your hand in a box,\nand it'll measure that distance,\n\n77\n00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:50.078\nwhich is supposedly unique\nenough to identify you.\n\n78\n00:03:50.078 --> 00:03:53.412\nNot globally, but\nI've seen this used in places where,\n\n79\n00:03:53.412 --> 00:03:55.987\npark reentry is where\nthis system was used.\n\n80\n00:03:55.987 --> 00:03:59.522\nIt's not unique like a fingerprint,\nbut based on the number\n\n81\n00:03:59.522 --> 00:04:01.845\nof guests they have today-\n&gt;&gt; Statistically.\n\n82\n00:04:01.845 --> 00:04:04.920\n&gt;&gt; It was unique enough to\nidentify a guest for park reentry,\n\n83\n00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.132\neven amongst twins, pretty cool stuff.\n\n84\n00:04:07.132 --> 00:04:11.113\nBut anyway, we digressed,\nwe can talk about cool biometrics-\n\n85\n00:04:11.113 --> 00:04:11.689\n&gt;&gt; Geeking out,\n\n86\n00:04:11.689 --> 00:04:13.614\nthat's kind of what geeks\ndo sometimes [LAUGH].\n\n87\n00:04:13.614 --> 00:04:16.783\n&gt;&gt; I really want my house to\nscan my iris as I come in.\n\n88\n00:04:16.783 --> 00:04:20.896\nBut there's all kinds of issues with iris\nscans and cleanliness and glasses, and\n\n89\n00:04:20.896 --> 00:04:22.694\nwe don't wanna go down that route.\n\n90\n00:04:22.694 --> 00:04:24.846\n&gt;&gt; Cataracts [LAUGH].\n\n91\n00:04:24.846 --> 00:04:26.837\n&gt;&gt; But\nthat does bring up a great point, but\n\n92\n00:04:26.837 --> 00:04:28.840\nlet's go back to what we need to do here.\n\n93\n00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.870\nAnd that is Windows 10 and biometrics.\n\n94\n00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.312\nAnd what the heck does Windows 10\nsupport as far as biometrics go?\n\n95\n00:04:34.312 --> 00:04:39.015\nFingerprints are gonna be one of them, and\nso that is probably where we should start.\n\n96\n00:04:39.015 --> 00:04:42.310\nSo we understand what biometrics is,\nwe wanna understand for\n\n97\n00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:45.730\nour exam that Windows 10 has\nnative support for biometrics.\n\n98\n00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:51.030\nThere is a Windows biometric framework,\nWBF, that is part of Windows 10.\n\n99\n00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:54.880\nSo that means developers,\nsoftware, hardware vendors,\n\n100\n00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:58.500\nthey can develop their own biometric\nsystems to work with Windows 10.\n\n101\n00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:03.070\nSo it's fantastic that the operating\nsystem has built-in support for\n\n102\n00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:06.500\nbiometrics, that's great for developers.\n\n103\n00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:10.577\nSo built in support for biometrics, what\nelse, configured through our settings app.\n\n104\n00:05:10.577 --> 00:05:12.636\nWe'll dive into there in just a second,\nand\n\n105\n00:05:12.636 --> 00:05:14.704\nit can be controlled through group policy.\n\n106\n00:05:14.704 --> 00:05:17.916\nIf we don't want our users using\nfingerprints for some reason,\n\n107\n00:05:17.916 --> 00:05:19.352\nwe can shut the feature off.\n\n108\n00:05:19.352 --> 00:05:23.008\nWe can go into the group policy,\neither the local policy for\n\n109\n00:05:23.008 --> 00:05:27.398\na single machine, or a domain based\ngroup policy or an entire network or\n\n110\n00:05:27.398 --> 00:05:29.979\na subset of machines or a subset of users.\n\n111\n00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:33.580\nYou guys know group policy works,\nso we can turn this off or\n\n112\n00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:36.310\nblock the availability to use biometrics.\n\n113\n00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:38.780\nBut if we don't,\nif we don't specifically go in and\n\n114\n00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:42.440\nsay we do not want biometrics being used,\nit's enabled.\n\n115\n00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:48.414\nWindows 10, you will be able to\nconfigure biometrics methods to log in.\n\n116\n00:05:48.414 --> 00:05:52.383\nAll right, so with that being said,\nwhen we look at this,\n\n117\n00:05:52.383 --> 00:05:55.790\nwe're really talking about Windows Hello.\n\n118\n00:05:55.790 --> 00:06:02.471\nWindows Hello is what Microsoft terms\ntheir biometric authentication process.\n\n119\n00:06:02.471 --> 00:06:08.922\nIt actually used to be Microsoft Passport,\nand there used to be two separate things,\n\n120\n00:06:08.922 --> 00:06:14.120\nMicrosoft Passport and Windows Hello,\nwhen it first came out.\n\n121\n00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:17.845\nThose two have been combined,\nit is just now Windows Hello.\n\n122\n00:06:17.845 --> 00:06:21.129\nSo if you're looking for\nMicrosoft Passport,\n\n123\n00:06:21.129 --> 00:06:24.500\nit's now built in or\nbaked into Windows Hello.\n\n124\n00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:28.210\nLet me clarify that, creators update and\n\n125\n00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:32.730\nlater, those two are combined.\n\n126\n00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:37.522\nIt's also specific to the device, this is\nunlike a smart card that I could bring to\n\n127\n00:06:37.522 --> 00:06:41.842\nmore than one device, if I have a card\nreader on each one of those devices.\n\n128\n00:06:41.842 --> 00:06:45.424\nThe biometrics are gonna be stored\nlocally on this machine, and\n\n129\n00:06:45.424 --> 00:06:46.960\nit is local to this device.\n\n130\n00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:49.841\nSo if I set up a fingerprint\nscan on this laptop,\n\n131\n00:06:49.841 --> 00:06:53.947\nit's not gonna allow me to use my\nfingerprint to log in to a different\n\n132\n00:06:53.947 --> 00:06:57.132\nWindows 10 machine somewhere\nelse on my network.\n\n133\n00:06:57.132 --> 00:06:58.396\n&gt;&gt; That's definitely\nsomething to think about.\n\n134\n00:06:58.396 --> 00:07:01.751\n&gt;&gt; Yes, absolutely, that might change,\nmaybe in the future,\n\n135\n00:07:01.751 --> 00:07:04.144\nwe break out that crystal ball\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n136\n00:07:04.144 --> 00:07:06.623\n&gt;&gt; And maybe we do store biometric data in\n\n137\n00:07:06.623 --> 00:07:10.662\nthe Active Directory database,\nbut at this point, not yet.\n\n138\n00:07:10.662 --> 00:07:15.066\nAll right, so join me on my screen here,\nI'm going to go, and I'm using my physical\n\n139\n00:07:15.066 --> 00:07:19.225\nmachine for this one, because sometimes\nit's a little tricky to get the USB and\n\n140\n00:07:19.225 --> 00:07:20.923\nthe biometrics to virtualize.\n\n141\n00:07:20.923 --> 00:07:24.457\nIt's just easier this way, so\non my physical laptop here,\n\n142\n00:07:24.457 --> 00:07:26.092\ngonna open up my settings.\n\n143\n00:07:26.092 --> 00:07:31.314\nAnd from my settings,\nI'm gonna take a look at Accounts.\n\n144\n00:07:31.314 --> 00:07:35.863\nFrom my Accounts page,\nI'm gonna go down to my sign in options.\n\n145\n00:07:35.863 --> 00:07:39.042\nNow normally,\nwhen you come into this screen,\n\n146\n00:07:39.042 --> 00:07:42.785\nyou will not see face recognition\nset up or listed here.\n\n147\n00:07:42.785 --> 00:07:47.405\nYou won't see anything unless\nyou have built-in hardware.\n\n148\n00:07:47.405 --> 00:07:51.032\nA lot of these laptops nowadays\nare starting to come with hardware that\n\n149\n00:07:51.032 --> 00:07:51.900\nsupports this.\n\n150\n00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:53.702\nI'll talk about what I\nmean in just a minute.\n\n151\n00:07:53.702 --> 00:07:56.579\nBut understand that I had to set\nsome stuff up before this demo,\n\n152\n00:07:56.579 --> 00:08:00.021\nbecause it does require a reboot, and\nI didn't want us to go through that.\n\n153\n00:08:00.021 --> 00:08:03.540\nSo that's why, if you don't see face\nrecognition setup listed there,\n\n154\n00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:07.173\ndon't worry All you gotta do is get\na camera that is supported, plug it in,\n\n155\n00:08:07.173 --> 00:08:09.100\nreboot, and you will see that.\n\n156\n00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:12.780\nBut before we get into that,\nlet's start with fingerprints.\n\n157\n00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:17.008\nAnd again, you won't see that there, I\nhave a USB-based fingerprint scanner, and\n\n158\n00:08:17.008 --> 00:08:20.110\nit's teeny tiny,\nyou won't be able to see that in my hand.\n\n159\n00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:25.361\nBut I'm simply gonna plug that in to\nan available USB port on my laptop.\n\n160\n00:08:25.361 --> 00:08:29.393\nAnd then usually, what I find is\nthat if I leave that screen and\n\n161\n00:08:29.393 --> 00:08:33.520\nthen come back to sign in options,\nyou'll see it show up here.\n\n162\n00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:39.300\nFingerprint, now because I already set\nthis up to make sure everything works,\n\n163\n00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:41.070\nI see add another.\n\n164\n00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:44.990\nIf you're coming in here for\nthe first time, it's gonna say setup.\n\n165\n00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:48.016\nI'm gonna click add another,\nthe problem is, I removed this, but\n\n166\n00:08:48.016 --> 00:08:49.569\nmy fingerprint's still stored.\n\n167\n00:08:49.569 --> 00:08:53.265\nAnd so once I plugged that back in it's,\nyeah, we're good to go.\n\n168\n00:08:53.265 --> 00:08:57.788\nLet me click add another, but this would\nbe just like you were doing it for\n\n169\n00:08:57.788 --> 00:08:58.839\nthe first time.\n\n170\n00:08:58.839 --> 00:09:02.439\nRight, cuz it's cool,\nyou can add more than one finger,\n\n171\n00:09:02.439 --> 00:09:05.245\nI might want to use both hands,\nfor example.\n\n172\n00:09:05.245 --> 00:09:09.650\nSometimes I'd plug it into a USB port on\nthis side, maybe sometimes I'd plug it\n\n173\n00:09:09.650 --> 00:09:14.142\ninto a USB port on the left side, and\nit's more convenient to swipe that finger.\n\n174\n00:09:14.142 --> 00:09:18.822\nOr maybe I'm a guitar virtuoso, and\nsometimes my index finger gets a little\n\n175\n00:09:18.822 --> 00:09:22.344\ncalloused up, and so\nI wanna use another finger as well.\n\n176\n00:09:22.344 --> 00:09:26.709\nJust in case, I don't know, I'm not-\n&gt;&gt; No, good example,\n\n177\n00:09:26.709 --> 00:09:29.286\nI wouldn't have thought of that,\nI'm like, okay, that works, yeah [LAUGH].\n\n178\n00:09:29.286 --> 00:09:30.344\n&gt;&gt; Or maybe you wanna set up,\n\n179\n00:09:30.344 --> 00:09:32.758\nit's like having a backup\npassword if you cut your finger.\n\n180\n00:09:32.758 --> 00:09:35.867\nRight, you wouldn't be able to\nauthenticate, most likely, and so\n\n181\n00:09:35.867 --> 00:09:39.256\nif you had two fingers set up, if you\ncut one, the other one's still good.\n\n182\n00:09:39.256 --> 00:09:40.710\n&gt;&gt; You don't even have to\ntake your bandaid off.\n\n183\n00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:43.530\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, something to think about,\nright, all right, so here we go.\n\n184\n00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:48.230\nWelcome to Windows Hello,\nI'm gonna click Get Started, and\n\n185\n00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:50.080\nit does have to make sure it's me.\n\n186\n00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:54.419\nI have a PIN set up on my laptop, if you\ndon't, you would be putting in a password.\n\n187\n00:09:54.419 --> 00:09:57.825\nBut you are gonna have to authenticate\neven though you're already logged on,\n\n188\n00:09:57.825 --> 00:10:00.104\nit really wants to make sure\nthat you are who you are.\n\n189\n00:10:00.104 --> 00:10:04.969\nWhat if I left this thing laying around,\nCherokee came over here, I know,\n\n190\n00:10:04.969 --> 00:10:06.720\nyou gotta watch her.\n\n191\n00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:10.878\nAnd she threw a thumbprint scanner\nin my machine while I was gone and\n\n192\n00:10:10.878 --> 00:10:14.827\nset up her finger cuz I left myself\nlogged in, which I often do.\n\n193\n00:10:14.827 --> 00:10:17.614\nAnd she set her fingerprint\nup under my account.\n\n194\n00:10:17.614 --> 00:10:19.104\n&gt;&gt; But that's pretty smart.\n&gt;&gt; That means later on,\n\n195\n00:10:19.104 --> 00:10:22.060\nshe could come back in my system and\nauthenticate as me.\n\n196\n00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:23.817\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so having the extra PIN there.\n\n197\n00:10:23.817 --> 00:10:27.370\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so this is a way to, hey,\nbefore I take your fingerprint and\n\n198\n00:10:27.370 --> 00:10:31.090\nput it with your account,\nlet me make sure it's truly you.\n\n199\n00:10:31.090 --> 00:10:34.224\nSo I'll put in my PIN,\nand there we go, it says,\n\n200\n00:10:34.224 --> 00:10:37.136\nswipe you finger on\nthe fingerprint sensor.\n\n201\n00:10:37.136 --> 00:10:40.883\nDepending on your fingerprint sensor,\nyou might have one that you just lay\n\n202\n00:10:40.883 --> 00:10:44.402\nyour finger on, it's like a larger sensor,\nit looks more like a pad.\n\n203\n00:10:44.402 --> 00:10:47.520\nOr like the one I've got here,\nit's more like a little slit, and\n\n204\n00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:49.460\nyou have to slide your finger across it.\n\n205\n00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:52.569\nIt just depends on what you have,\nI know Nate has a Lenovo or\n\n206\n00:10:52.569 --> 00:10:56.699\na ThinkPad, and he's got the fingerprint\nsensor built in, and yours does?\n\n207\n00:10:56.699 --> 00:10:58.828\n&gt;&gt; Not this machine, but my personal.\n\n208\n00:10:58.828 --> 00:11:02.927\n&gt;&gt; Your personal, nice, yeah, so some\nlaptops have this technology built into it\n\n209\n00:11:02.927 --> 00:11:05.870\nor you can get an external\ndevice like I have here.\n\n210\n00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:11.225\nSo I'm simply gonna swipe my finger across\nthat, and it tells me it's already set up.\n\n211\n00:11:11.225 --> 00:11:13.680\nOops, I've used the same\nfinger I did last time.\n\n212\n00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:16.840\nI'll use a different finger,\nI'll use my pinky finger this time.\n\n213\n00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:21.450\nWe'll slide that across there, and you'll\nsee, it's similar to many other devices.\n\n214\n00:11:21.450 --> 00:11:25.630\nIf you've ever set up anything like this\non a smartphone, it wants to kind of get\n\n215\n00:11:25.630 --> 00:11:29.900\nyour finger from different angles and make\nsure it's got a good view of that finger.\n\n216\n00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:32.181\nThat way, it's a lot more reliable,\n\n217\n00:11:32.181 --> 00:11:35.471\ncuz you're never gonna swipe\nit exactly the same way.\n\n218\n00:11:35.471 --> 00:11:36.665\n&gt;&gt; The exact same angle or something.\n\n219\n00:11:36.665 --> 00:11:40.537\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so swipe it over there\na few times, and it'll let you know.\n\n220\n00:11:40.537 --> 00:11:45.580\nI'm just gonna keep swiping, keep swiping,\nand eventually it says, all set.\n\n221\n00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:49.480\nYour fingerprint, use your fingerprint the\nnext time you want to unlock your device,\n\n222\n00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:51.600\nand I'll click Close, and it's that easy.\n\n223\n00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:56.250\nSo what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna\nhit Windows key L to lock my screen.\n\n224\n00:11:56.250 --> 00:11:58.350\nAnd I'm gonna take my finger,\nI'll use my pinkie finger,\n\n225\n00:11:58.350 --> 00:11:59.572\ncuz that's the one we just set up.\n\n226\n00:11:59.572 --> 00:12:04.900\nAnd I'm gonna swipe it across that,\nand I'm right back into my system.\n\n227\n00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:06.279\n&gt;&gt; Pretty cool [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; I'm telling you,\n\n228\n00:12:06.279 --> 00:12:09.553\nonce you do something like this,\nit's hard to go back, almost.\n\n229\n00:12:09.553 --> 00:12:14.478\nBecause it's so quick and so easy to\nsimply swipe my finger across there.\n\n230\n00:12:14.478 --> 00:12:18.720\nNo long password to type in,\nno PIN to remember, none of that.\n\n231\n00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:20.539\nJust swipe your finger,\nand you're good to go.\n\n232\n00:12:20.539 --> 00:12:23.131\nAll right, so that's fingerprint,\n\n233\n00:12:23.131 --> 00:12:26.860\nnext thing let's take a look\nat facial recognition.\n\n234\n00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:31.063\nNow, when we talk about facial\nrecognition, you probably heard,\n\n235\n00:12:31.063 --> 00:12:35.871\nor you might have heard, facial\nrecognition is not new, it's been around.\n\n236\n00:12:35.871 --> 00:12:40.658\nI have an Alienware laptop that Is old,\nI mean, it's a few years old,\n\n237\n00:12:40.658 --> 00:12:42.864\nand it did facial recognition.\n\n238\n00:12:42.864 --> 00:12:47.689\nWhere I could set it up so that when I\nsat in front of it, it would see me and\n\n239\n00:12:47.689 --> 00:12:48.430\nlog me in.\n\n240\n00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:52.307\nIf somebody else sat in front of my\nlaptop, it would actually lock the screen,\n\n241\n00:12:52.307 --> 00:12:54.438\ncuz it would recognize that it wasn't me.\n\n242\n00:12:54.438 --> 00:12:58.358\nBut it was quirky, it didn't work\nall the time, it was actually so\n\n243\n00:12:58.358 --> 00:13:01.720\nannoying sometimes that I left it off,\nI didn't use it.\n\n244\n00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:06.491\nIt was just a cool, geeky thing to say you\nhad, and then I kind of gave up on it.\n\n245\n00:13:06.491 --> 00:13:09.237\nAnd there were some other issues\nwith those early facial recognition\n\n246\n00:13:09.237 --> 00:13:09.930\ntechnologies.\n\n247\n00:13:09.930 --> 00:13:14.670\nAnd that was that I could use a picture\non a lot of them to bypass it.\n\n248\n00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:18.770\nIf I have a, hey Cherokee,\nsmile for me, and take a picture.\n\n249\n00:13:18.770 --> 00:13:21.530\nI need to post something on Twitter,\nlet me get a picture.\n\n250\n00:13:21.530 --> 00:13:23.214\nOr find a picture of her online somewhere.\n\n251\n00:13:23.214 --> 00:13:24.656\n&gt;&gt; And I'm sure some already exist, yeah.\n\n252\n00:13:24.656 --> 00:13:27.980\n&gt;&gt; Print it out, get me a nice\neight by ten printout of that,\n\n253\n00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:30.510\nand then hold in front of the camera.\n\n254\n00:13:30.510 --> 00:13:33.670\nRight, it sees that face and\ngoes, look, there's Cherokee, and\n\n255\n00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:37.890\nlogs me in as Cherokee, so\nthere were some issues.\n\n256\n00:13:37.890 --> 00:13:43.920\nWindows 10 and Windows Hello requires\na special kind of camera to try\n\n257\n00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:50.340\nto mitigate some of that risk, it's their\nIR cameras, they have infrared sensors.\n\n258\n00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:53.740\nAnd it allows them to get\na little bit of depth perception\n\n259\n00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:57.700\nin the image that it's perceiving or\nthat it's sensing.\n\n260\n00:13:59.030 --> 00:14:00.210\nWhich, obviously,\n\n261\n00:14:00.210 --> 00:14:04.740\na picture is a two-dimensional thing,\nright, there's no depth to that.\n\n262\n00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:08.685\nSo if it can't detect any depth,\nit's gonna assume you're not real,\n\n263\n00:14:08.685 --> 00:14:11.732\nthat you're an image, and\nit's not gonna allow you.\n\n264\n00:14:11.732 --> 00:14:14.240\nSo that's the idea, it's not 100%.\n\n265\n00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:20.594\n&gt;&gt; An evolving process,\ncuz it's a cat and mouse game.\n\n266\n00:14:20.594 --> 00:14:24.325\nYou come up with a cool new secure\ntechnology, and then right away,\n\n267\n00:14:24.325 --> 00:14:27.080\npeople are already working to break that.\n\n268\n00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:30.135\n&gt;&gt; Yeah absolutely, I've read an article,\nI don't know if it's,\n\n269\n00:14:30.135 --> 00:14:31.510\nI haven't tested it myself.\n\n270\n00:14:31.510 --> 00:14:35.651\nBut I'll tell you that people said that\nif you can print out an infrared image,\n\n271\n00:14:35.651 --> 00:14:39.360\nwhich is those grayscales,\nalmost like a heat map type thing.\n\n272\n00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:42.150\nIf you can print one of those out and\nhold in front of it.\n\n273\n00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:45.700\nIt can fake the system out to make\nit think it's seeing infrared.\n\n274\n00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:47.040\nI don't know if that's true or\n\n275\n00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:50.900\nnot, that remains to be seen,\nthat's not gonna be on the exam.\n\n276\n00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:52.730\nRight, so\nwe need to understand how it works here.\n\n277\n00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:54.960\nSo now,\nyou understand the technology behind it.\n\n278\n00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:59.730\nAs I said, some of the newer laptops have\ncameras built in that do support this.\n\n279\n00:14:59.730 --> 00:15:04.880\nI have a third party that we purchased,\nthat we're going to be using here,\n\n280\n00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:07.780\nthat does have the IR capabilities,\nand that's all you do.\n\n281\n00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:10.420\nIf you're going out and\nyou're trying to buy a camera,\n\n282\n00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:15.100\nit's going to advertise the fact that it\nworks with Windows Hello and Windows 10.\n\n283\n00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:20.230\nAnd if it does, you can be assured\nthat it has the IR capabilities\n\n284\n00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:21.520\n&gt;&gt; Mike, how much did that set you back?\n\n285\n00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:24.887\nDid you have to sell any body parts\non the black market for that?\n\n286\n00:15:24.887 --> 00:15:28.203\n&gt;&gt; I used Don's credit card, so [LAUGH].\n\n287\n00:15:28.203 --> 00:15:28.955\n&gt;&gt; Yeah?\n\n288\n00:15:28.955 --> 00:15:33.513\n&gt;&gt; I wanna say this was somewhere between\n50 and 100, somewhere around there 60,\n\n289\n00:15:33.513 --> 00:15:34.055\n$70.\n\n290\n00:15:34.055 --> 00:15:37.400\nThere's probably a few\nthat are less expensive.\n\n291\n00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:39.680\nI know there's some that\nare more expensive.\n\n292\n00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:41.979\nThis one happened to have\nreally good reviews and\n\n293\n00:15:41.979 --> 00:15:45.074\nno driver installation required,\nwhich is always a plus for me.\n\n294\n00:15:45.074 --> 00:15:47.882\nYou can just plug and\nplay, we're good to go.\n\n295\n00:15:47.882 --> 00:15:51.720\nSo that was one of the things I looked at,\nand it had really good reviews as far as,\n\n296\n00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:53.855\nthis particular one is a Mouse brand.\n\n297\n00:15:53.855 --> 00:15:58.578\nI'm unfamiliar with that brand, but like\nI said, it got really good reviews, and\n\n298\n00:15:58.578 --> 00:16:00.478\nit's worked flawlessly so far.\n\n299\n00:16:00.478 --> 00:16:01.475\nSo, all right,\n\n300\n00:16:01.475 --> 00:16:05.763\nso I am gonna plug it in, again,\nyou wouldn't normally see this here.\n\n301\n00:16:05.763 --> 00:16:10.003\nI've just had to make sure everything was\ngonna work, so it's already been set up.\n\n302\n00:16:10.003 --> 00:16:14.021\nI'm going to plug in my camera.\n\n303\n00:16:14.021 --> 00:16:16.390\nI will give that just a minute.\n\n304\n00:16:16.390 --> 00:16:17.570\nI know when I plugged this one in,\n\n305\n00:16:17.570 --> 00:16:22.500\nI did have to reboot the system before\nit would show up in these screen here.\n\n306\n00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:26.230\nMy laptop has a built in camera,\n\n307\n00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:29.000\nbut it doesn't support,\nit doesn't do the IR, this\n\n308\n00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.850\nDell laptop was a little bit older before\nthis technology was really available.\n\n309\n00:16:33.990 --> 00:16:37.820\nSo that's why I've got this third\nparty camera, this external camera.\n\n310\n00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:42.380\nSo like I said it'll tell you,\nyou might have to reboot.\n\n311\n00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:46.470\nIf it doesn't show up in the screen,\nand you know your camera supports\n\n312\n00:16:46.470 --> 00:16:49.650\nWindows Hello, just reboot your system\nafter you've plugged it in, and\n\n313\n00:16:49.650 --> 00:16:51.440\nif you've had to install any drivers.\n\n314\n00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:55.070\nReboot because that's what I did, I know\nthe first thing I did was went to camera,\n\n315\n00:16:55.070 --> 00:16:58.680\nthe good old camera app.\n\n316\n00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:01.380\nAnd, whoo, there we go,\nthat's a little odd looking at,\n\n317\n00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:05.370\nI'm gonna close that,\nto make sure the camera was recognized.\n\n318\n00:17:05.370 --> 00:17:10.140\nIt still wasn't showing up here, reboot\nthe system, it shows up here no problem.\n\n319\n00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:15.120\nAll right, now once that is done that's\nright, I should've looked while I was\n\n320\n00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:19.480\nthere, make sure I had the thing pointed\nthe correct way, which I think I do.\n\n321\n00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:24.080\nI'm gonna click Face recognition setup,\nI'm gonna look at this camera,\n\n322\n00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:26.230\nnot this camera, so\nforgive me as I look down here.\n\n323\n00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:30.740\nI'll say, Setup, and it tells me I\ndon't have to enter passwords anymore.\n\n324\n00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:31.930\nI'm all about that.\n\n325\n00:17:31.930 --> 00:17:36.510\nGet started, make sure I am who I say\nI am, before it allows me to do this.\n\n326\n00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:39.149\nPut in my pin.\n\n327\n00:17:39.149 --> 00:17:43.280\n&gt;&gt; That's creepy.\n\n328\n00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:44.298\nI mean, not your picture.\n\n329\n00:17:44.298 --> 00:17:46.870\n[LAUGH] But I mean-\n&gt;&gt; It is, it reminds you of,\n\n330\n00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:47.510\nI don't watch TV.\n\n331\n00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:48.750\n&gt;&gt; Horror film.\n\n332\n00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:51.840\n&gt;&gt; Either like a horror flick, or-\n&gt;&gt; Ghost hunters.\n\n333\n00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:52.490\nThat's what you're doing.\n\n334\n00:17:52.490 --> 00:17:53.750\nYou're hunting ghost, right?\n\n335\n00:17:53.750 --> 00:17:54.970\n&gt;&gt; Yes, exactly.\n\n336\n00:17:54.970 --> 00:17:58.585\nOr one of those nature shows or\nthey're watching the animals at night.\n\n337\n00:17:58.585 --> 00:18:01.892\n[CROSSTALK] Infrared.\n\n338\n00:18:01.892 --> 00:18:05.250\nSo it tells me, use your face the next\ntime you wanna unlock your device.\n\n339\n00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:08.860\nNow it does not mean take your face, and\npress it Up against your keyboard, or\n\n340\n00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:10.160\nanything like that.\n\n341\n00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:12.450\nI'm kidding I know you guys\nweren't gonna try that.\n\n342\n00:18:12.450 --> 00:18:16.450\nIt also tells me if you wore glasses\nwhile setting up Windows Hello,\n\n343\n00:18:16.450 --> 00:18:19.980\nselect improve recognition, to go\nthrough the setup again without them.\n\n344\n00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:22.230\n&gt;&gt; Interesting.\n&gt;&gt; This will help us recognize you\n\n345\n00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:23.330\neither way.\n\n346\n00:18:23.330 --> 00:18:25.170\nThat was one of the big\nthings with my earlier,\n\n347\n00:18:25.170 --> 00:18:30.410\nthat Alienware, was if I wasn't in\nthe same room, and it was different\n\n348\n00:18:30.410 --> 00:18:32.583\nlighting the incandescent light at home\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n349\n00:18:32.583 --> 00:18:36.141\n&gt;&gt; Versus the florescent lighting at work,\nwas actually causing a problem.\n\n350\n00:18:36.141 --> 00:18:39.242\nI had to set it up multiple times for\ndifferent lighting environments,\n\n351\n00:18:39.242 --> 00:18:40.220\nit was a pain.\n\n352\n00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:43.930\nThis stuff works flawlessly,\nit's just amazing, I love new technology.\n\n353\n00:18:43.930 --> 00:18:46.960\nAnyway, so\nI could click improve recognition, and\n\n354\n00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:48.150\nit's gonna do it all over again.\n\n355\n00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:51.204\nBut this time I might make a funny face,\nno.\n\n356\n00:18:51.204 --> 00:18:52.790\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I might smile,\n\n357\n00:18:52.790 --> 00:18:56.040\nbecause maybe I'm smiling\nwhen I log in to my system,\n\n358\n00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:58.150\nbecause I'm a happy Windows 10 user.\n\n359\n00:18:58.150 --> 00:19:01.560\n[LAUGH] So you can definitely\ngo through that a few times, and\n\n360\n00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:06.220\nyou're just adding more views of yourself,\nso that it can recognize you, hopefully.\n\n361\n00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:10.748\nHonestly, if you do it once and\nit doesn't have a problem logging you in,\n\n362\n00:19:10.748 --> 00:19:12.687\nthen there's really no problem with this.\n\n363\n00:19:12.687 --> 00:19:16.660\nBut if you go home and it doesn't\nrecognize you, set it up again, or\n\n364\n00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:20.870\nif you wear glasses when you get home,\nyou could put your contacts out.\n\n365\n00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:26.490\nJust do that improved recognition, and\nadd a couple more images of yourself.\n\n366\n00:19:26.490 --> 00:19:28.750\nAll right, I'm going to go ahead and\nclick close, and\n\n367\n00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:31.218\nyou'll see the improve recognition\nis right here as well.\n\n368\n00:19:31.218 --> 00:19:35.338\nSo, if I get home and\nI wanted to add another view of myself, or\n\n369\n00:19:35.338 --> 00:19:39.559\nanother finger, because I had cut one or\nsomething like that.\n\n370\n00:19:39.559 --> 00:19:42.915\nI can always come in here and\nadd either one of those,\n\n371\n00:19:42.915 --> 00:19:47.030\nsame thing, now I am going to,\nalso, while I'm here.\n\n372\n00:19:47.030 --> 00:19:51.430\nAutomatically dismiss the lock screen,\nif we recognize your face, and\n\n373\n00:19:51.430 --> 00:19:52.110\nI've got that turned on.\n\n374\n00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:54.890\nYou might or might not wanna use that.\n\n375\n00:19:54.890 --> 00:19:57.960\nIf I lock my screen, and then I sit\ndown in front of my computer and\n\n376\n00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:00.800\nit sees my face,\nit'll automatically unlock it.\n\n377\n00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:03.920\nSo I can use it to log on,\nthat's one thing.\n\n378\n00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:08.260\nI can also use it to dismiss the lock\nscreen, which is a separate option.\n\n379\n00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:11.018\nIf I turn this off,\nit won't dismiss my lock screen, but\n\n380\n00:20:11.018 --> 00:20:13.320\nI can still use it to\nauthenticate to my system.\n\n381\n00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:15.390\nLet's test it out.\n\n382\n00:20:15.390 --> 00:20:17.660\nI'm gonna,\nkinda shift out of the view of my camera,\n\n383\n00:20:17.660 --> 00:20:19.920\nand I'm gonna hit my lock screen.\n\n384\n00:20:21.190 --> 00:20:22.990\nAnd you'll notice up there on my computer,\nit says,\n\n385\n00:20:22.990 --> 00:20:25.900\nget that little circle with\nlike an eyebrow over it.\n\n386\n00:20:25.900 --> 00:20:28.700\nAnd just make sure you are centered,\nand looking directly at the center.\n\n387\n00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:30.800\nWhich is why I'm not centered and\nnot looking at the camera,\n\n388\n00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:32.340\nso don't log in just yet.\n\n389\n00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:37.000\nBut watch what happens as soon as\nI slide over, you see what it did?\n\n390\n00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:37.700\n&gt;&gt; It winked.\n\n391\n00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:38.690\n&gt;&gt; It did, it winked.\n\n392\n00:20:38.690 --> 00:20:39.830\nIs that a smiley face?\n\n393\n00:20:39.830 --> 00:20:41.340\nIt says hello Mike Rodrick.\n\n394\n00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:43.270\nDismiss the lock screen to\nsign back into Windows.\n\n395\n00:20:43.270 --> 00:20:46.080\nIt's like wait, weren't you\ngonna automatically dismiss it?\n\n396\n00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:46.580\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n397\n00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:47.370\n&gt;&gt; No, it is dismissed.\n\n398\n00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:51.990\nNotice I didn't have to type\nin a password or anything.\n\n399\n00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:55.420\nSo it unlocks it,\nit's a little tricky on the wording there.\n\n400\n00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:58.890\nI know you're expecting it to like\npop back right into your desktop.\n\n401\n00:20:58.890 --> 00:21:01.830\nit unlocks it, but you're still,\nyou can just click any key, or\n\n402\n00:21:01.830 --> 00:21:06.060\nclick a button on your mouse, or\nI use my touch screen to swipe it up.\n\n403\n00:21:06.060 --> 00:21:10.040\nSo, it's unlocked, you just have to\nsimply, because the idea here is,\n\n404\n00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:13.430\nlet's say I locked my screen and\nI go down to the cafeteria.\n\n405\n00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:17.380\nI come back to my desk and Cherokee's with\nme we're talking about something, and\n\n406\n00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:20.560\nI sit down at my desk to\ncontinue talking with her.\n\n407\n00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:25.170\nThe camera happens to see my face and if\nit unlocked it and took away the screen.\n\n408\n00:21:25.170 --> 00:21:26.240\n&gt;&gt; You might not want to reveal that.\n\n409\n00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:29.206\n&gt;&gt; I could be exposing data,\nto whomever was with me.\n\n410\n00:21:29.206 --> 00:21:33.237\nSo that's still giving me the control\nthere of saying, hey we've unlocked it,\n\n411\n00:21:33.237 --> 00:21:36.703\nare you sure you want to kind of lift\ncover right and expose that data.\n\n412\n00:21:36.703 --> 00:21:39.580\nSo that's, I think that's\na pretty cool way of doing it.\n\n413\n00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:40.320\n&gt;&gt; It is pretty cool.\n\n414\n00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:43.251\nIt could be annoying if you don't\nunderstand why they're doing it, at first.\n\n415\n00:21:43.251 --> 00:21:43.944\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n416\n00:21:43.944 --> 00:21:46.407\nonce you understand this like,\nthat makes sense.\n\n417\n00:21:46.407 --> 00:21:48.770\nAll right yeah what if I log off.\n\n418\n00:21:48.770 --> 00:21:50.780\nLet me close this.\n\n419\n00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:52.360\nI got lots of EMs running.\n\n420\n00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:56.040\nLet's pause some of these EMs real quick.\n\n421\n00:21:57.610 --> 00:22:00.330\nOtherwise is not gonna like me logging of.\n\n422\n00:22:00.330 --> 00:22:05.550\nSo, while I'm getting those paused,\n\n423\n00:22:05.550 --> 00:22:10.110\nand actually this might take,\nwe're gonna get that taken care of.\n\n424\n00:22:10.110 --> 00:22:15.160\nLet me make sure I've got anything else,\nso once I log off, we'll see we now have\n\n425\n00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:20.650\nthese options to authenticate to\nWindows 10, once you get that setup.\n\n426\n00:22:20.650 --> 00:22:23.440\nSo I'll tell you what,\nlet me get all these machines killed, and\n\n427\n00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:24.280\nwe'll come right back.\n\n428\n00:22:26.590 --> 00:22:31.199\nSo I've got all those running applications\nclosed, my virtual machines, and\n\n429\n00:22:31.199 --> 00:22:33.413\nnow I'm going to log off of my system.\n\n430\n00:22:37.770 --> 00:22:41.848\nAnd when I go to sign back in,\nwe'll see, oops,\n\n431\n00:22:41.848 --> 00:22:45.637\n[LAUGH] yep, it was too quick for\nme right now.\n\n432\n00:22:45.637 --> 00:22:49.880\nIt was so quick it's already dismissed the\nlaunch screen, to sign back into Windows.\n\n433\n00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:53.170\nIt sees me here, and\nhonestly I could just hit any key, and\n\n434\n00:22:53.170 --> 00:22:56.770\nit's going to log me right back in.\n\n435\n00:22:56.770 --> 00:23:02.090\nLet me step out of the way,\nlean over here, and log back out.\n\n436\n00:23:02.090 --> 00:23:09.020\nThere' some other things that I want\nto show you, before it logs me back in.\n\n437\n00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:11.270\nSo, there it is, you can see it,\nhow it's kind of.\n\n438\n00:23:11.270 --> 00:23:11.920\n&gt;&gt; Searching.\n\n439\n00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:14.740\n&gt;&gt; It's looking around,\nisn't that cool, looking for you.\n\n440\n00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:18.000\nBut if I hit my, just tap a key or\n\n441\n00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.310\nclick a button on a mouse,\nI come to this screen here.\n\n442\n00:23:20.310 --> 00:23:22.200\nIt tells me the same thing,\nthat camera's looking for me.\n\n443\n00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:24.710\nAnd if you could see my red lights,\nthey're flickering away,\n\n444\n00:23:24.710 --> 00:23:29.290\nletting me know that the camera's active,\nand that it is trying to find me.\n\n445\n00:23:29.290 --> 00:23:33.323\nI'm gonna click sign-in options, cuz you\njust saw that the camera option works,\n\n446\n00:23:33.323 --> 00:23:34.081\nlog me back in.\n\n447\n00:23:36.314 --> 00:23:38.960\nAnd evidently I got a little too close,\nand it logged me back in again.\n\n448\n00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:42.122\nSo here's what we're gonna do,\nI'm gonna go into my settings.\n\n449\n00:23:44.895 --> 00:23:46.370\nAnd I'm going to remove,\n\n450\n00:23:46.370 --> 00:23:50.200\nactually I should've just\nunplugged the camera I suppose.\n\n451\n00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:53.330\nWe'll remove that so\nthat it doesn't get in our way, so\n\n452\n00:23:53.330 --> 00:23:54.460\nI can show you the other options.\n\n453\n00:23:54.460 --> 00:24:00.093\nSo let me log out, now I don't have\nto get out in front of my camera.\n\n454\n00:24:00.093 --> 00:24:02.410\n[LAUGH] I can stand normal again.\n\n455\n00:24:02.410 --> 00:24:06.810\nAnd when I log back in, I can type\nin my password like I normally do.\n\n456\n00:24:06.810 --> 00:24:10.670\nOr I can go down here to sign in,\nin options and\n\n457\n00:24:10.670 --> 00:24:14.330\nI click sign in options,\nI've still got a few choices down here.\n\n458\n00:24:14.330 --> 00:24:15.682\nYou hover over it'll tell you what it is.\n\n459\n00:24:15.682 --> 00:24:19.240\nThere's pin, so\nif I want to use my pin to log in,\n\n460\n00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:22.400\nwhich I haven't shown you how to set up,\nwe will in another episode.\n\n461\n00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:27.080\nI can use my password to log in,\nwhich is what it's set to currently.\n\n462\n00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:30.100\nThat's why that particular\nbox has got that grey border,\n\n463\n00:24:30.100 --> 00:24:33.580\nthat lighter grey border around it,\nor I can switch to fingerprint.\n\n464\n00:24:33.580 --> 00:24:36.670\nAnd if I hadn't turned off\nthe facial recognition,\n\n465\n00:24:36.670 --> 00:24:39.040\nthe camera option would\nbe showing here as well.\n\n466\n00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:40.940\nBut if I wanna use my\nfingerprint to sign in,\n\n467\n00:24:40.940 --> 00:24:43.970\nI simply click fingerprint,\nI can say that.\n\n468\n00:24:43.970 --> 00:24:48.030\nAnd then again,\nrun my finger over the scanner, and\n\n469\n00:24:48.030 --> 00:24:51.140\nsure enough I'm logged right back in.\n\n470\n00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:52.500\nAnd the cool thing is, it remembers.\n\n471\n00:24:52.500 --> 00:25:00.210\nSo, if I log off now And\nI go to log back into my system.\n\n472\n00:25:00.210 --> 00:25:03.750\nNotice it says, to sign in, scan your\nfinger across the fingerprint reader.\n\n473\n00:25:03.750 --> 00:25:06.680\nSo you don't have to go to that\nevery time, and choose, hey,\n\n474\n00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:09.020\nI wanna use my fingerprint, hey,\nI wanna use my fingerprint.\n\n475\n00:25:09.020 --> 00:25:11.090\nOr hey, I wanna use facial recognition.\n\n476\n00:25:11.090 --> 00:25:16.310\nIt remembers the one you used last, and\nit will bring that one up as the default.\n\n477\n00:25:16.310 --> 00:25:20.160\nNow, let's say I had used\nthe fingerprint to login for\n\n478\n00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:23.040\nthe last week, but\nI cut my finger really bad.\n\n479\n00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:26.105\nAnd I only set up one finger, and\nit's not recognizing my finger anymore,\n\n480\n00:25:26.105 --> 00:25:27.760\nbecause of that cut.\n\n481\n00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:29.440\nNow I can't get in into my system?\n\n482\n00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:31.930\nNo, I can simply go to sign in options,\nand\n\n483\n00:25:31.930 --> 00:25:36.970\nI can switch it back to password, or\nPIN, and I can authenticate that way.\n\n484\n00:25:36.970 --> 00:25:39.940\nSo you can always change what\nit's using to authenticate.\n\n485\n00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:43.945\nBut understand, it remembers or\nuses the last method that you used.\n\n486\n00:25:43.945 --> 00:25:48.270\nAlso keep in mind that, this does\nnot go with you to other machines.\n\n487\n00:25:48.270 --> 00:25:52.034\nSo if you set those up on this laptop,\nand you got a desktop at home,\n\n488\n00:25:52.034 --> 00:25:56.290\nyou'd have to have the hardware,\nthe fingerprint scanner, the camera.\n\n489\n00:25:56.290 --> 00:26:00.530\nAnd you'd have to set up that on that\nmachine as well, it's all stored Locally.\n\n490\n00:26:00.530 --> 00:26:03.710\nAnd Cherokee, I think that pretty\nmuch covers Windows Hello and\n\n491\n00:26:03.710 --> 00:26:05.680\nBiometrics, in Windows 10.\n\n492\n00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:09.412\n&gt;&gt; Well I know what I'll be asking Don for\nnow, thank you so much Mike,\n\n493\n00:26:09.412 --> 00:26:13.030\nand thank you for joining us as well,\nbut for now let's sign out.\n\n494\n00:26:13.030 --> 00:26:14.490\nI've been your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n495\n00:26:14.490 --> 00:26:18.350\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick,\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITPRO TV\n\n496\n00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:24.818\n[MUSIC]\n\n497\n00:26:24.818 --> 00:26:27.849\nThank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:08.491\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.491 --> 00:00:12.020\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPROTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:15.470\n&gt;&gt; Welcome everyone to your\nConfiguring Windows Devices series,\n\n6\n00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:19.540\nespecially if you're studying for\nthat 70-697 exam.\n\n7\n00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:21.350\nI'm your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n8\n00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:25.000\nIn this episode we'll continue to\ntaking a look at how we can support\n\n9\n00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.330\nauthentication and authorization.\n\n10\n00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.310\nAnd with us today in studio,\nwe have Mr. Mike Rodrick.\n\n11\n00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:31.380\nHow is it going today, Mike?\n\n12\n00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.320\n&gt;&gt; It's going great Cherokee.\n\n13\n00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:33.170\nThanks for having me back.\n\n14\n00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:34.860\n&gt;&gt; Of course.\n&gt;&gt; We've got a little bit more to talk\n\n15\n00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.490\nabout when it comes to good old\n\n16\n00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:38.750\nauthentication authorization\nin Windows 10.\n\n17\n00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.350\nOn our previous episodes,\nwe took at look at certificates and\n\n18\n00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.670\nhow we can use those,\nand troubleshoot those.\n\n19\n00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.820\nWe also looked at some of the new\nbiometric capabilities within Windows 10.\n\n20\n00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.700\nWe looked at using a fingerprint scanner,\nas well as using one of those new,\n\n21\n00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.210\nfancy IR cameras do some\nfacial recognition.\n\n22\n00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:54.750\n&gt;&gt; That was fun.\n\n23\n00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.682\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That was pretty exciting, wasn't it?\n\n24\n00:00:56.682 --> 00:00:58.890\nAll right, and so\ncontinuing along that thought process,\n\n25\n00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.310\nwe're next gonna talk about something\nknown as virtual smart cards.\n\n26\n00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:07.340\nAnd most of you are probably familiar\nwith the concept of a smart card, but\n\n27\n00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.570\nlet's make sure we review,\njust make sure we're all on the same page.\n\n28\n00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:11.540\nWhen we talk about a smart card,\n\n29\n00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.820\nwe're talking about a credit card-like\ndevice that has a little chip on it.\n\n30\n00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.920\nAnd we can store information in there,\ntypically a certificate, right?\n\n31\n00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.790\nWe talked about a certificate,\nan electronic document\n\n32\n00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.040\nthat ties your identity to a key pair and\nyou can use to identify yourself, right?\n\n33\n00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.560\nIf we have a smart card reader plugged\ninto our system or a system that has\n\n34\n00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.790\na smart card reader built in to it,\nor I can insert that smart card.\n\n35\n00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:37.690\nWe can use that for\nidentification purposes.\n\n36\n00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:39.630\n&gt;&gt; Now Mike you talked\nabout this in another show,\n\n37\n00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.960\nsome reasons why smart cards aren't\nalways the best solution, like cost.\n\n38\n00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.040\nAnd then if someone were to go ahead and\nlose their smart card,\n\n39\n00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.630\nhow do we handle that situation?\n\n40\n00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.310\nSo would this be, would you say, a better\nalternative to these types of issues?\n\n41\n00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.540\n&gt;&gt; It can definitely help\nwith both of those, right?\n\n42\n00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.290\nBecause all of those\nare definitely some issues we have\n\n43\n00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.740\nwith using traditional smart cards.\n\n44\n00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.980\nWe've got the expense of the equipment,\nyou don't have to buy external readers or\n\n45\n00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:07.630\nI have to make sure I buy devices\nthat have readers built into them.\n\n46\n00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.110\nI've gotta buy the cards themselves,\nI've gotta buy the equipment or\n\n47\n00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.113\npay somebody to load the information onto\nthe smart cards like the certificates.\n\n48\n00:02:15.113 --> 00:02:19.100\nAnd then exactly like you said Cherokee,\nif that user leaves their certificate or\n\n49\n00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.210\nsmart card at home how do I authenticate?\n\n50\n00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:25.140\nDo we have it set up where they can use\neither the smart card or the password?\n\n51\n00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.850\nIsn't that reducing our security overall?\n\n52\n00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:31.310\nOr do we say, hey, you can't log in,\nand you have to go home for the day?\n\n53\n00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.540\nDo we have to reissue cards and\ndelete the old card,\n\n54\n00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.240\nor invalidate the old card, revoke it?\n\n55\n00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.970\nThere are some issues there.\n\n56\n00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.100\nVirtual smart cards are the same concept,\nright?\n\n57\n00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:46.350\nWe're gonna have a smart card that we're\ngonna load a certificate on that I can use\n\n58\n00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.590\nfor authentication purposes\namongst other things.\n\n59\n00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.750\nBut it's virtual,\nit's not a physical thing.\n\n60\n00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:58.500\nIt actually get stored in something known\nas the TPM or the Trusted Platform Module.\n\n61\n00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.150\nWhich is a special chip\non your motherboard\n\n62\n00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.270\nthat's isolated from everything else and\nvery secure.\n\n63\n00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:05.970\nMost of our modern motherboards,\n\n64\n00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.680\nmost of your modern computers\nare gonna come with a TPM.\n\n65\n00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.200\nThis isn't something you can go out and\nbuy and add on.\n\n66\n00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.230\nIt is soldered onto the motherboard.\n\n67\n00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.460\nIt's not exportable, I can't take\nthat TPM out of one computer and\n\n68\n00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:20.660\nput it in another computer.\n\n69\n00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:23.600\nSo it's not something that I can\ntransfer or anything like that.\n\n70\n00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.510\nI do have to make sure I have\na system that has a TPM built in.\n\n71\n00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:29.855\n&gt;&gt; Now, Mike, I know I've had issues\nbefore where I actually had to\n\n72\n00:03:29.855 --> 00:03:33.075\nupdate my TPM, so are there different\nversions that we need to be aware of\n\n73\n00:03:33.075 --> 00:03:34.657\nwhen we're using this technology?\n\n74\n00:03:34.657 --> 00:03:36.765\n&gt;&gt; There are,\nas far as the operating system goes.\n\n75\n00:03:36.765 --> 00:03:39.865\nWindows started supporting\nthis back in Windows 8.1, so\n\n76\n00:03:39.865 --> 00:03:42.337\n8.1 and later, you'll be good to go.\n\n77\n00:03:42.337 --> 00:03:47.337\nYou do need a TPM, a trusted platform\nmodule version 1.2 or higher.\n\n78\n00:03:47.337 --> 00:03:51.017\nI think 1.2 is the latest at\nthe time of this shooting.\n\n79\n00:03:51.017 --> 00:03:53.257\nBut 1.2 or higher, should be good to go.\n\n80\n00:03:53.257 --> 00:03:56.717\nThere's also a limit of ten\nvirtual smart-cards per computer.\n\n81\n00:03:56.717 --> 00:03:59.947\nNow be careful with that one,\nthat's a great exam question.\n\n82\n00:03:59.947 --> 00:04:02.870\nIt's not per user, it's per computer.\n\n83\n00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:06.660\nI could have ten virtual smart cards\nmyself from my one account, or\n\n84\n00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:10.130\nit could be a scenario where I share\nthis computer with other people and\n\n85\n00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:12.690\neach of us has our our own virtual\nsmart card loaded in the TPM.\n\n86\n00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:16.700\nBut it's a total of ten virtual\nsmart cards on that machine,\n\n87\n00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:19.795\nnot on a per user basis.\n\n88\n00:04:19.795 --> 00:04:22.967\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; This might be a silly question but\n\n89\n00:04:22.967 --> 00:04:24.744\nwhat would I do with ten smart cards.\n\n90\n00:04:24.744 --> 00:04:27.130\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's actually\na decent question.\n\n91\n00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:30.170\nI'm gonna play poker with them and\nthrow away my worst two and\n\n92\n00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:31.660\nget my next best two.\n\n93\n00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:34.700\nNo, you might have more than one for\ndifferent purposes, right?\n\n94\n00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:37.170\nRemember, certificates,\nthose electronic documents,\n\n95\n00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:41.020\ncan be issued by a certificate\nauthority for varying purposes.\n\n96\n00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:44.200\nSometimes those certificates\ncan be set up for multipurpose.\n\n97\n00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:48.700\nIt might support client authentications,\nsmart card log on, and EFS,\n\n98\n00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:50.090\nEncrypting File System.\n\n99\n00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:55.180\nOr your organization might decide to\nissue out single purpose certificates,\n\n100\n00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:58.000\nwhere one certificate is good for\nclient authentication, but\n\n101\n00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.190\na separate certificate for\nsmart card logon.\n\n102\n00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:05.660\nAnd a separate certificate for\nEFS or something like that.\n\n103\n00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:06.360\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n104\n00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:07.840\n&gt;&gt; And that could be due to many reasons.\n\n105\n00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:11.220\nWe talk about that more in the server\nenvironment or the server classes.\n\n106\n00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:15.900\nWhere we talk about, how long they're good\nfor key lengths, and things like that.\n\n107\n00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.490\nSo, I might have several\nvirtual smart cards,\n\n108\n00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:21.190\neach one with its own certificate for\na different purpose, right?\n\n109\n00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:22.370\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Or it could be multiple\n\n110\n00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:26.900\nusers on my system,\nif it's a shared computer, all right?\n\n111\n00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:31.220\nAll right, so, and for the exam,\nunderstand those limitations, right?\n\n112\n00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:35.540\nTPM 1.2 or higher, Windows 8.1 or\nlater, minimum, or maximum,\n\n113\n00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:37.584\nof ten virtual smart cards per computer.\n\n114\n00:05:37.584 --> 00:05:42.760\nAminimum 8 character PIN and the PIN is\nwhat is associated with that smart card.\n\n115\n00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:46.190\nRemember smart cards are basic,\nthey are multifactor authentication.\n\n116\n00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:47.890\nYou've got something you have.\n\n117\n00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:49.510\nThat's gonna be the smart card.\n\n118\n00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:52.440\nAnd really it's the certificate\nthat's loaded up in that smart card\n\n119\n00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:53.710\nis what I have.\n\n120\n00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:58.130\nAnd then the PIN that's associated with\nthat smart card is the something I know.\n\n121\n00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:01.310\nAnd this is what gives us that\nmultifactor authentication.\n\n122\n00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:05.960\nAnd why smart cards are a much\nmore robust solution than using,\n\n123\n00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:09.040\nsay usernames and\npasswords which are easy to share,\n\n124\n00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:13.800\neasy to write down, have somebody\nelse intercept or see you type in.\n\n125\n00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:14.360\nAnd many,\n\n126\n00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:18.600\nmany vulnerabilities associated with\nusing passwords as our authentication.\n\n127\n00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:21.880\nAll right, so now we've got an idea again,\n\n128\n00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:24.980\na virtual smart card is gonna\nbe a virtual smart card.\n\n129\n00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:26.790\nIt's not something I have,\nit's stored in that TPM.\n\n130\n00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:31.890\nWe're also gonna have to request\na certificate that can get loaded up into\n\n131\n00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:32.930\nthat smart card.\n\n132\n00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:33.610\nAnd if you think about it,\n\n133\n00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:36.260\nthis is the exact same thing that\nhappens in the physical world.\n\n134\n00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:37.700\nRight, if I'm an organization and\n\n135\n00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:43.100\nI'm gonna issues my users certificates,\nI'm going to buy the physical smart card.\n\n136\n00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:46.600\nI've got a machine that'll help me\nload data onto those smart cards.\n\n137\n00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:50.420\nI'm going to either request on\nbehalf of the user a certificate, or\n\n138\n00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:51.780\ntheir gonna request it.\n\n139\n00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:54.520\nI'm gonna load it up on my card,\nand I'm gonna hand it to them.\n\n140\n00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:57.470\nWhen we talk about virtual smart cards,\nit's all the same,\n\n141\n00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:00.350\nexcept there's no physical card, right?\n\n142\n00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:05.100\nI'm gonna generate a card on my machine,\nand it's gonna be stored in that TPM.\n\n143\n00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:07.590\nAnd then I'm gonna\nrequest a certificate and\n\n144\n00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:11.040\nload it up onto that\ngenerated virtual smart card.\n\n145\n00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:15.300\nBut other than that, it's gonna work\nexactly the same as a physical smart card.\n\n146\n00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:20.010\nIn fact, it's pretty cool because once we\nget it set up to Windows, it looks like\n\n147\n00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:24.910\nyou have a smart card reader plugged in,\nand a smart card inserted all the time.\n\n148\n00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:27.330\nSo whenever you need it,\nit's already there.\n\n149\n00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:28.000\n&gt;&gt; That's pretty cool.\n\n150\n00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.300\n&gt;&gt; It is, let's say your organization\nuses smart cards to remote link access,\n\n151\n00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:34.110\nsome kind of web app that they have.\n\n152\n00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:36.880\nWell, every time I have to go to\nthat web app, I've gotta remember,\n\n153\n00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:38.620\ndo I have my reader plugged in?\n\n154\n00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:39.800\nWhere's my darn smart card?\n\n155\n00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:40.810\nLet me plug it in.\n\n156\n00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:44.010\nWith virtual smart cards,\nI don't have to do any of that, right?\n\n157\n00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:47.900\nIt's already there and accessible by\nthe operating system as soon as I log in.\n\n158\n00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:51.806\n&gt;&gt; So when you say already there, meaning\nI don't have to purchase anything, or\n\n159\n00:07:51.806 --> 00:07:54.660\ndo I have any special tool or\ndownload that I have to grab?\n\n160\n00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:55.320\n&gt;&gt; Nothing, right?\n\n161\n00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:55.868\n&gt;&gt; No, okay.\n\n162\n00:07:55.868 --> 00:07:57.780\n&gt;&gt; Windows has it all built into it.\n\n163\n00:07:57.780 --> 00:07:58.960\nSo let's take a look at my screen here.\n\n164\n00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:00.820\nI'll show you how to generate\na virtual smart card.\n\n165\n00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:04.710\nWe'll go and request a certificate, get\nit loaded up and see how we can use it.\n\n166\n00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:05.350\n&gt;&gt; Great.\n\n167\n00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:08.480\n&gt;&gt; So I'm gonna fire up PowerShell, you\ncould use PowerShell or a command prompt.\n\n168\n00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:11.850\nI do need to make sure I have\nan administrative prompt, so\n\n169\n00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:13.000\nlet me do that one more time.\n\n170\n00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:19.100\nThen I get my administrative credentials\nrunning here and the command is gonna be\n\n171\n00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:24.210\ntpmvscmgr, that's the utility\nwe're gonna be using.\n\n172\n00:08:24.210 --> 00:08:27.270\nIt always helps me to remember\nif I know what it stands for,\n\n173\n00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:31.020\ntpm virtual smart card manager.\n\n174\n00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:33.940\nSometimes I have to say it to myself as\nI'm typing it to make sure I get that in\n\n175\n00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:39.540\nthe right order, tpmvsc,\nvirtual smart card, mgr, or manager.\n\n176\n00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:43.111\nThere's several switches\nyou can use with it.\n\n177\n00:08:43.111 --> 00:08:43.881\nOop, tpm, did I?\n\n178\n00:08:43.881 --> 00:08:44.897\n&gt;&gt; You didn't do the .exe?\n\n179\n00:08:44.897 --> 00:08:46.276\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] No, you know?\n\n180\n00:08:46.276 --> 00:08:46.866\n&gt;&gt; What?\n&gt;&gt; I was so\n\n181\n00:08:46.866 --> 00:08:48.742\nworried about making sure I got VSC-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n182\n00:08:48.742 --> 00:08:49.898\n&gt;&gt; In the right order,\n\n183\n00:08:49.898 --> 00:08:51.729\nI put tmp instead of tpm.\n\n184\n00:08:51.729 --> 00:08:53.041\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; So temporary, yeah.\n\n185\n00:08:53.041 --> 00:08:53.852\n&gt;&gt; It's not temporary?\n\n186\n00:08:53.852 --> 00:08:55.396\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No, it's not, so\n\n187\n00:08:55.396 --> 00:08:58.563\ntrusted platform module\nvirtual smart card manager.\n\n188\n00:08:58.563 --> 00:09:00.313\n&gt;&gt; It just shows you how blind I am.\n\n189\n00:09:00.313 --> 00:09:01.957\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No calling on me for\n\n190\n00:09:01.957 --> 00:09:03.587\nsyntax check over here.\n\n191\n00:09:03.587 --> 00:09:04.314\n&gt;&gt; You weren't any help there, Cherokee.\n\n192\n00:09:04.314 --> 00:09:05.940\n&gt;&gt; I know I failed you Mike.\n\n193\n00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:08.725\n&gt;&gt; All right, there we go,\nI know that scrolled by awfully quick,\n\n194\n00:09:08.725 --> 00:09:10.390\nI'm not gonna go through all of that.\n\n195\n00:09:10.390 --> 00:09:15.325\nBut if you type in tpmvscmgr,\nyou will get this help associated with it.\n\n196\n00:09:15.325 --> 00:09:20.709\nAnd really, the few switches we're gonna\nbe dealing with, are going to be name.\n\n197\n00:09:20.709 --> 00:09:22.470\nWe're gonna give the card a name,\n\n198\n00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:25.287\nsomething we can reference\nit by if we need to.\n\n199\n00:09:25.287 --> 00:09:31.564\nThere is admin key, which can either be\nset to prompt, default, or random, right?\n\n200\n00:09:31.564 --> 00:09:34.526\nDefault is 01234567.\n\n201\n00:09:34.526 --> 00:09:37.385\nPrompt will do just that,\nprompt you for it,\n\n202\n00:09:37.385 --> 00:09:40.030\nrandom will generate its own random key.\n\n203\n00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:45.408\nActually default is longer, I lied to you,\nfor admin key, it's much longer.\n\n204\n00:09:45.408 --> 00:09:48.500\nAnd really, the admin key is\nif we need to reset the PIN.\n\n205\n00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:53.020\nSo if I had issued for my users a virtual\nsmart card, I gave them their PIN,\n\n206\n00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:57.900\nthey forgot the PIN,\nI could use the admin key to reset it.\n\n207\n00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:01.157\nSo if you're an organization where\nyou're gonna be using this and\n\n208\n00:10:01.157 --> 00:10:04.415\nyou want administrative control\nover those virtual smart cards,\n\n209\n00:10:04.415 --> 00:10:08.193\nyou gonna wanna prompt or have it set to\nsomething you know or use the default,\n\n210\n00:10:08.193 --> 00:10:11.243\nwhich wouldn't be a good idea\nbecause everybody knows that.\n\n211\n00:10:11.243 --> 00:10:12.415\nOr choose random,\n\n212\n00:10:12.415 --> 00:10:17.116\nmeaning I don't really plan on using\nthe admin key to reset the PIN, right?\n\n213\n00:10:17.116 --> 00:10:19.160\nCuz I won't know what it is,\nit'll be randomly generated.\n\n214\n00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:23.030\nPIN is another one we're gonna deal with.\n\n215\n00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:27.108\nThat's what the user is gonna type in\nwhen they go to try to use their virtual\n\n216\n00:10:27.108 --> 00:10:27.837\nsmart card.\n\n217\n00:10:27.837 --> 00:10:31.110\n&gt;&gt; I was just thinking, well,\nat first, when would you want that?\n\n218\n00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:35.040\nBut, what about the situations where\nyou don't want that technician to be on\n\n219\n00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:37.940\nthe hook or responsible for\nany of that sensitive data.\n\n220\n00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:42.080\nAnd maybe it's the CEO or someone in here,\nlike no, only this person could ever,\n\n221\n00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:45.753\nshould ever potentially see this\ninformation, so that's [CROSSTALK].\n\n222\n00:10:45.753 --> 00:10:47.960\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely,\nit could be a situation like that.\n\n223\n00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:50.190\nIt could be where you wanna\nuse virtual smart cards, but\n\n224\n00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:51.780\nyour organization doesn't.\n\n225\n00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:53.250\nMaybe this is your own computer,\n\n226\n00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:57.160\nyou're in a small shop that doesn't really\nhave centralized IT, or even within\n\n227\n00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:00.610\nan organization, where they've given you\nthe ability to use virtual smart cards,\n\n228\n00:11:00.610 --> 00:11:02.980\nbut they don't support it,\nthey don't do anything with it.\n\n229\n00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:03.840\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; In that case,\n\n230\n00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:07.470\nI don't wanna use default, because I don't\nwant anybody being able to reset my PIN.\n\n231\n00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:09.050\nI don't wanna do prompt.\n\n232\n00:11:09.050 --> 00:11:14.505\nI'll just leave it to random and make sure\nI use a good strong PIN for my access.\n\n233\n00:11:14.505 --> 00:11:17.072\nAnd if I forget it I'm gonna\nhave to delete the key or\n\n234\n00:11:17.072 --> 00:11:20.800\nthe virtual smart card and\nrecreate a virtual smart card anyway.\n\n235\n00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:24.000\nSo I don't really care, as long as\nthe admin key is long and strong and\n\n236\n00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.578\nnobody can guess it,\nI don't care what it is, right?\n\n237\n00:11:26.578 --> 00:11:30.010\nSo that's when I would use random,\nwhich is what I'm gonna do in here.\n\n238\n00:11:30.010 --> 00:11:32.280\nPIN, again,\nthat's what the user is going to do or\n\n239\n00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:35.552\nwhat the user would end up using\nwhen they try to use the smart card.\n\n240\n00:11:35.552 --> 00:11:38.033\nCan I use use in a sentence one more time?\n\n241\n00:11:38.033 --> 00:11:39.956\nI think I got three in there\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n242\n00:11:39.956 --> 00:11:41.022\n&gt;&gt; And then generate is\n\n243\n00:11:41.022 --> 00:11:43.280\nwhat actually creates the card.\n\n244\n00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:46.360\nThere are other switches that they\nmight get you with on the exams,\n\n245\n00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:48.730\nI would look through here and\nbe familiar with it.\n\n246\n00:11:48.730 --> 00:11:51.900\nLike PIN policy,\nyou can set the min length.\n\n247\n00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:56.420\nRemember the max, the minimum length by\ndefault is 8, but if you wanted to create\n\n248\n00:11:56.420 --> 00:12:00.190\na longer requirement, you wanted at least\n10 characters, you can definitely do that.\n\n249\n00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:04.480\nOr if you wanted to make sure nobody went\npast a certain length, you can set max.\n\n250\n00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:07.000\nYou can decide whether uppercase,\nlowercase, digits, or\n\n251\n00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.900\nspecial characters can\nbe included in the PIN.\n\n252\n00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:16.850\nSo you can set all of this using\nyour PIN policy switch, right?\n\n253\n00:12:16.850 --> 00:12:19.726\nAnd they give you a bunch of good\ninformation and then right here,\n\n254\n00:12:19.726 --> 00:12:20.992\nlet's just zoom into that.\n\n255\n00:12:20.992 --> 00:12:26.305\nHere is my default PIN policy,\nminlen 8, maxlen 127, uppercase,\n\n256\n00:12:26.305 --> 00:12:32.238\nlowercase, digits and special characters\nare all allowed in your PIN, right?\n\n257\n00:12:32.238 --> 00:12:37.000\nIt's good to know, they like to ask\nyou about defaults on the exam.\n\n258\n00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:41.220\nAll right and then they give you some\nexamples of how to run this, but\n\n259\n00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:43.060\nI'm gonna show you myself.\n\n260\n00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:45.792\nSo tpm, make sure I get this right.\n\n261\n00:12:45.792 --> 00:12:46.450\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n262\n00:12:46.450 --> 00:12:51.861\n&gt;&gt; tpm, good, thank you, vscmgr/name.\n\n263\n00:12:51.861 --> 00:12:55.810\nAnd I'll call this my\nlogon virtual smart card.\n\n264\n00:12:55.810 --> 00:12:58.640\nAnd then we're gonna do /PIN.\n\n265\n00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:01.360\nAnd I'm just gonna put in default,\nactually, you know what?\n\n266\n00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:05.424\nLet's do prompt, just to have some fun.\n\n267\n00:13:05.424 --> 00:13:10.215\nAnd then we'll do an admin key\n\n268\n00:13:10.215 --> 00:13:15.020\nrandom and then /generate.\n\n269\n00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:20.275\nAnd I guess something wrong, it's not\nrecognized tpm virtual smart card, man.\n\n270\n00:13:20.275 --> 00:13:22.873\nSo the first time I made a typo on tpm.\n\n271\n00:13:22.873 --> 00:13:28.621\n&gt;&gt; My gosh, did I [LAUGH], I'm failing\nmiserably to help you Mike, I know.\n\n272\n00:13:28.621 --> 00:13:31.430\n&gt;&gt; You know, this is my safety net\nover here and she's letting me down.\n\n273\n00:13:31.430 --> 00:13:33.283\n&gt;&gt; Maybe I should go home and\nget my glasses.\n\n274\n00:13:33.283 --> 00:13:36.274\n&gt;&gt; You know it's probably my fault,\nI didn't make the font big enough for us.\n\n275\n00:13:36.274 --> 00:13:38.269\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Let's zoom in and\n\n276\n00:13:38.269 --> 00:13:43.573\ndouble-check that syntax one\nmore time here, tpmvscmgr.\n\n277\n00:13:43.573 --> 00:13:46.020\n&gt;&gt; Virtual smart card manager.\n\n278\n00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:47.330\n&gt;&gt; Okay, you think we're good?\n\n279\n00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:48.290\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna remember that now.\n\n280\n00:13:48.290 --> 00:13:53.836\n&gt;&gt; I think we're good,\nwe'll go ahead and hit Enter and\n\n281\n00:13:53.836 --> 00:13:58.283\nevidently not, so let's try that again.\n\n282\n00:13:58.283 --> 00:13:59.387\n&gt;&gt; No red.\n\n283\n00:13:59.387 --> 00:14:03.952\n&gt;&gt; No red, it just gave me the\ninstructions, you know what I'm going to\n\n284\n00:14:03.952 --> 00:14:09.900\ndo is, Change this from prompt to default.\n\n285\n00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:11.230\n&gt;&gt; Okay [LAUGH].\n\n286\n00:14:11.230 --> 00:14:13.630\nI'm trying to squint over here [LAUGH].\n\n287\n00:14:13.630 --> 00:14:16.500\n&gt;&gt; And I'm not sure why, I'm gonna\njust double-check my command here.\n\n288\n00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:20.544\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; tpmvscmgr name, log on, PIN,\n\n289\n00:14:20.544 --> 00:14:26.850\nadmin key random, generate,\nI do not see anything wrong with that.\n\n290\n00:14:27.930 --> 00:14:33.070\nUnknown action name, interesting,\nyou know what I forgot, Cherokee?\n\n291\n00:14:33.070 --> 00:14:38.230\n&gt;&gt; To name the, like you did in the first\none, you said for your login [INAUDIBLE].\n\n292\n00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:41.520\n&gt;&gt; Close, but it's actually something\nthat I didn't even mention.\n\n293\n00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:45.770\nLet me bump this up to the top of\nthe screen here, where everybody can see.\n\n294\n00:14:45.770 --> 00:14:47.600\n&gt;&gt; The computer name?\n\n295\n00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:50.758\n&gt;&gt; I forgot the keyword create.\n\n296\n00:14:50.758 --> 00:14:53.893\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That is an important one.\n\n297\n00:14:53.893 --> 00:14:56.452\nIt makes sense now that I say it, right?\n\n298\n00:14:56.452 --> 00:15:00.259\nYou've gotta have the word create or-\n&gt;&gt; Right, I mean you also,\n\n299\n00:15:00.259 --> 00:15:02.376\nwith PowerShell, set.\n\n300\n00:15:02.376 --> 00:15:03.819\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; But would you be able to modify once\n\n301\n00:15:03.819 --> 00:15:04.531\nyou start a security?\n\n302\n00:15:04.531 --> 00:15:05.220\n&gt;&gt; No, but you can destroy.\n\n303\n00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:06.460\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n304\n00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:11.820\n&gt;&gt; If you need to remove a smart card\nthere is a command to destroy a tpm.\n\n305\n00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:13.230\nSo without the keyword create or\n\n306\n00:15:13.230 --> 00:15:16.750\ndestroy, all of these switches\nreally didn't do anything.\n\n307\n00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:19.375\nI need to tell it, hey,\nI'm creating a card and\n\n308\n00:15:19.375 --> 00:15:22.320\nhere's all the parameters I wanna\nuse with that creation process.\n\n309\n00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:23.460\n&gt;&gt; Well good, now I know.\n\n310\n00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:28.270\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so now we should be able to,\nactually create our virtual smart card.\n\n311\n00:15:30.290 --> 00:15:32.303\nAnd it's going through the process and\n\n312\n00:15:32.303 --> 00:15:35.242\nI'll zoom in here in just\na second as soon as it finishes.\n\n313\n00:15:35.242 --> 00:15:38.422\nBut it's simply regurgitating\nwhat it's doing.\n\n314\n00:15:38.422 --> 00:15:41.258\nIt's doing default, so 12345678, right,\n\n315\n00:15:41.258 --> 00:15:44.308\nbecause I used the word\ndefault instead of prompt.\n\n316\n00:15:44.308 --> 00:15:48.519\nPrompt, it would've just given me a cursor\nand say hey, type in your own PIN.\n\n317\n00:15:48.519 --> 00:15:52.301\nIt's gonna have to be a minimum of 8,\nmaximum of 127, upper case, lowercase and\n\n318\n00:15:52.301 --> 00:15:53.570\neverything it's allowed.\n\n319\n00:15:53.570 --> 00:15:55.910\nSo then it goes in and\ncreates the smart card.\n\n320\n00:15:55.910 --> 00:16:00.179\nInitializes the virtual smart card\ncomponent, creating a virtual smart card\n\n321\n00:16:00.179 --> 00:16:04.770\ncomponent, creates the simulator, creates\nthe reader, waiting for the device,\n\n322\n00:16:04.770 --> 00:16:08.860\nauthenticating to the TPM, and\neventually we get TPM smart card created.\n\n323\n00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:10.033\n&gt;&gt; That didn't take too long.\n\n324\n00:16:10.033 --> 00:16:10.807\n&gt;&gt; So we are, no,\n\n325\n00:16:10.807 --> 00:16:14.410\nit's really easy if you don't make\nany typos on your command, right?\n\n326\n00:16:14.410 --> 00:16:17.115\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And you will need this,\n\n327\n00:16:17.115 --> 00:16:19.077\nyou wanna document this.\n\n328\n00:16:19.077 --> 00:16:24.941\nIt's pretty straightforward, root\nsmarcartreader/0000 for the first one.\n\n329\n00:16:24.941 --> 00:16:28.122\nAnd that is actually gonna get\nincremented as you create more.\n\n330\n00:16:28.122 --> 00:16:32.650\nBut that's the device instance ID for\nthat particular reader.\n\n331\n00:16:32.650 --> 00:16:35.230\nAnd when you have more than one, or\n\n332\n00:16:35.230 --> 00:16:38.910\nwhen you're trying to destroy one,\nyou're gonna need that information, right?\n\n333\n00:16:38.910 --> 00:16:44.100\nTo designator, to let it know which one\nit is you're trying to remove or use.\n\n334\n00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:49.550\nAll right, so now that we've got a smart\ncard created, it's stored in the TPM,\n\n335\n00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:53.320\nthe next thing that we need to\ndo is request a certificate and\n\n336\n00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:54.458\nload it into that smart card.\n\n337\n00:16:54.458 --> 00:17:00.130\nSo I am going to go to my Start menu and\ntype in certificate.\n\n338\n00:17:00.130 --> 00:17:03.250\nMany different ways you can get to this,\nyou can create your own custom MMC, or\n\n339\n00:17:03.250 --> 00:17:07.225\nyou can use the built in\nManage User Certificates,\n\n340\n00:17:07.225 --> 00:17:11.420\ncertmgr.msc, that's what I'm gonna use.\n\n341\n00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:15.230\nAnd your company, you might have\na web page that you navigate to to\n\n342\n00:17:15.230 --> 00:17:19.090\nrequest certificates, depends on how\nyour organization has that set up.\n\n343\n00:17:19.090 --> 00:17:23.240\nBut I'm gonna go into Personal and\nCertificates, and I have a certificate\n\n344\n00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:27.580\nissued already for things like EFS,\nsecure email, client authentication.\n\n345\n00:17:27.580 --> 00:17:31.750\nIt's actually a default, or\nit's a automatic certificate being issued,\n\n346\n00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:35.148\nthat we've set up in our domain,\nor in my little test domain.\n\n347\n00:17:35.148 --> 00:17:37.806\nBut this one doesn't\nsupport Smart Card Logon.\n\n348\n00:17:37.806 --> 00:17:43.529\nSo I'm gonna right-click on certificates,\nAll tasks, Request new certificate.\n\n349\n00:17:43.529 --> 00:17:47.529\nIt's gonna launch my handy dandy wizard,\nand I'm gonna go through this relatively\n\n350\n00:17:47.529 --> 00:17:51.450\nquick because this isn't a class about\ncertification authorities, all right?\n\n351\n00:17:51.450 --> 00:17:53.580\nWe need to watch our server classes for\nthat.\n\n352\n00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:56.757\nBut I'm gonna request\nITProTV smartcard logon.\n\n353\n00:17:56.757 --> 00:17:58.340\nAnd I'm gonna choose Enroll.\n\n354\n00:18:00.707 --> 00:18:06.000\nHere, notice it's asking me for my PIN\nbecause it's gonna try to load it up.\n\n355\n00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.730\nIt sees that I have\na smart card in my system.\n\n356\n00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:12.280\nRemember what I said,\nwhen you create the virtual smart card,\n\n357\n00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:16.900\nWindows creates a smart card reader and\ninserts that smart card.\n\n358\n00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:18.470\nAnd so every time you log into the system,\n\n359\n00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:21.410\nit's just like that smart card\nwas plugged in, it sees it.\n\n360\n00:18:21.410 --> 00:18:26.040\nAnd so when I request a certificate, it\nsays, you've got a smart card plugged in,\n\n361\n00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:29.600\nI bet you're trying to load this\ncertificate onto that smart card.\n\n362\n00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:32.490\nBut I'm not gonna let you do that\nunless you can prove to me you know\n\n363\n00:18:32.490 --> 00:18:34.560\nthat that's your smart card, right?\n\n364\n00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:40.280\nSo it's asking me for the PIN which we\nleft at the default, which was 12345678.\n\n365\n00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:44.126\nI'll click OK, and knock on wood,\n\n366\n00:18:44.126 --> 00:18:49.430\nwe get STATUS Succeeded and\nwe are good to go.\n\n367\n00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:52.790\nSo now we've got that virtual\nsmart card loaded up or, sorry,\n\n368\n00:18:52.790 --> 00:18:55.830\nthat certificate,\nloaded up on that smart card.\n\n369\n00:18:55.830 --> 00:18:58.890\nAnd there you can see it right there,\nI got a certificate issued for\n\n370\n00:18:58.890 --> 00:19:03.170\nthe purpose of smart card logon and\nclient authentication.\n\n371\n00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:05.450\nAnd so now we've got it.\n\n372\n00:19:05.450 --> 00:19:10.234\nAnd if we want to use it, well, I'm\njust simply gonna log out of my system,\n\n373\n00:19:14.869 --> 00:19:18.369\nAnd when I log back in,\nI'm gonna click Sign in options.\n\n374\n00:19:19.390 --> 00:19:23.090\nAnd notice I now have a key,\nwhich is for password, but\n\n375\n00:19:23.090 --> 00:19:26.260\nI also have this little computer chip,\nthat's supposed to be a TPM.\n\n376\n00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:30.550\nAnd the icon is slightly different for\na physical smart card,\n\n377\n00:19:30.550 --> 00:19:34.450\nthis is how you can differentiate,\nthis is for virtual smart cards.\n\n378\n00:19:34.450 --> 00:19:38.640\nSo if I click on that, notice it wants\nme to type in the PIN associated with,\n\n379\n00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:43.280\nI didn't have to insert anything, right,\nit's already in the virtual reader.\n\n380\n00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:46.041\nSo I simply type in my\nPIN associated with that\n\n381\n00:19:46.041 --> 00:19:51.040\ncard, And we are-\n&gt;&gt; I always have people tell me\n\n382\n00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:55.395\nit looked like, have you ever had to\nteach like floating gate transistors for\n\n383\n00:19:55.395 --> 00:19:56.198\nthe-\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n384\n00:19:56.198 --> 00:19:58.834\n&gt;&gt; So people always say it looks\na little fuzzy caterpillar.\n\n385\n00:19:58.834 --> 00:19:59.393\n&gt;&gt; It does.\n\n386\n00:19:59.393 --> 00:20:01.574\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's what it reminded me of.\n\n387\n00:20:01.574 --> 00:20:03.230\nTotally random, but yeah.\n\n388\n00:20:03.230 --> 00:20:05.090\n&gt;&gt; I can see that,\nI can definitely see that.\n\n389\n00:20:05.090 --> 00:20:05.990\nBut there you go.\n\n390\n00:20:05.990 --> 00:20:08.570\nSo I didn't have to remember\nto bring my card with me.\n\n391\n00:20:08.570 --> 00:20:12.920\nI'm still using multi-factor\nauthentication because if somebody\n\n392\n00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:17.070\nwants to log in as me,\nthey're gonna have to have this device.\n\n393\n00:20:17.070 --> 00:20:20.300\nBecause basically my device now\nbecomes the something I have\n\n394\n00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:23.990\nbecause that card is stored in\nthe TPM on this motherboard.\n\n395\n00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:26.910\nAnd I would need the PIN\nassociated with it.\n\n396\n00:20:26.910 --> 00:20:29.420\nAll right, Cherokee, so\nthat takes care of virtual smart cards.\n\n397\n00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:32.650\nThe next thing I wanna do,\nI know we're short on time.\n\n398\n00:20:32.650 --> 00:20:35.340\nThere's one more,\ntwo more things really I wanna show you\n\n399\n00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:40.520\nwithin the authentication for\nWindows 10, pictures and PINs.\n\n400\n00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:45.599\nSo I'm gonna go to my Start menu,\nand click on my little settings app,\n\n401\n00:20:45.599 --> 00:20:49.142\nand go to accounts, and\nthen Sign-in options.\n\n402\n00:20:49.142 --> 00:20:53.322\nNow, we've already looked at\nWindows Hello on my other system,\n\n403\n00:20:53.322 --> 00:20:58.110\nI'm actually not seeing any of that here,\nlet's jump out to my physical.\n\n404\n00:20:58.110 --> 00:20:59.415\nSometimes with the virtual,\n\n405\n00:20:59.415 --> 00:21:03.940\nyou get a little bit of an issue with\nsome of those authentication methods.\n\n406\n00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:05.630\nSo just a different Windows 10 machine,\n\n407\n00:21:05.630 --> 00:21:07.910\nthis is a physical one\ninstead of a virtual one.\n\n408\n00:21:07.910 --> 00:21:12.651\nAnd I'm gonna go to Accounts,\nand then Sign-in options, right?\n\n409\n00:21:12.651 --> 00:21:16.190\nAnd we already looked at fingerprint and\nface recognition.\n\n410\n00:21:16.190 --> 00:21:18.370\nPassword, I can change my password.\n\n411\n00:21:18.370 --> 00:21:20.760\nHere I can set up a PIN,\nwhich I've already done,\n\n412\n00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:23.970\nmy organization requires a PIN,\nI don't wanna change it.\n\n413\n00:21:23.970 --> 00:21:27.010\nIf you don't have a PIN set up, you can\nsimply click the button that says Add,\n\n414\n00:21:27.010 --> 00:21:30.310\nand it will let you set up a PIN.\n\n415\n00:21:30.310 --> 00:21:34.700\nRemember, a PIN, personal identification\nnumber, is more secure, believe it or not,\n\n416\n00:21:34.700 --> 00:21:35.410\nthan a password.\n\n417\n00:21:35.410 --> 00:21:39.940\nEven a relatively short PIN can be\nmore secure than a long password.\n\n418\n00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:42.950\nThere's lots of great articles out\nthere if you wanna read up as to why.\n\n419\n00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:46.830\nBut it really comes back to the fact\nthat a PIN is local to this one device.\n\n420\n00:21:46.830 --> 00:21:49.840\nSo if somebody compromised my PIN here,\n\n421\n00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:52.760\nthey wouldn't be able to access\nany other systems, right?\n\n422\n00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:56.949\nOr get access to network resources that\nstill require me to have a password to\n\n423\n00:21:56.949 --> 00:21:57.476\naccess.\n\n424\n00:21:57.476 --> 00:22:02.450\nSo you could set up a PIN with Windows 10,\nwe can also use a picture password.\n\n425\n00:22:02.450 --> 00:22:05.647\nNow, this is something I wanna show you\nbecause, again, they do call it out on\n\n426\n00:22:05.647 --> 00:22:09.330\nthe objectives, understand that we don't\nuse this in our domain environments.\n\n427\n00:22:09.330 --> 00:22:11.764\nBut a picture password is a way to use,\n\n428\n00:22:11.764 --> 00:22:15.260\nthey'll still say it's a form\nof biometrics, all right?\n\n429\n00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:17.940\nBecause it is-\n&gt;&gt; That's weird.\n\n430\n00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:20.530\nBecause it's something,\nI would think, something you know.\n\n431\n00:22:20.530 --> 00:22:23.165\n&gt;&gt; It is, and\nI don't really agree with that.\n\n432\n00:22:23.165 --> 00:22:27.280\nI've seen several things where Microsoft\nhas put out that says it's biometrics, or\n\n433\n00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:28.880\nthey are just lumping it with biometrics,\n\n434\n00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:31.390\nthey are not making it\nreal clear that it's not.\n\n435\n00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:36.870\nBut let me back up because if we're gonna\ndo a picture password, basically we create\n\n436\n00:22:36.870 --> 00:22:41.700\ngestures on a picture, and that's gonna\nallow me to authenticate, to login.\n\n437\n00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:43.580\nThe idea is when I pull\nup my logon screen,\n\n438\n00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:47.700\nI will see the picture that I've selected,\nand I have to make the same gestures,\n\n439\n00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:51.620\nwhich are either gonna be lines,\ncircles, or taps.\n\n440\n00:22:51.620 --> 00:22:57.060\nThree gestures on that picture,\nthat will allow me to authenticate.\n\n441\n00:22:58.130 --> 00:23:01.842\nAnd let's just go through the process,\nthe first thing we're gonna need,\n\n442\n00:23:01.842 --> 00:23:04.828\nCherokee, is a picture, so-\n&gt;&gt; What kind of picture should we get,\n\n443\n00:23:04.828 --> 00:23:06.670\nand what kind of picture\nshould we not get?\n\n444\n00:23:06.670 --> 00:23:11.301\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna ask you, what do you\nwanna search for here for images?\n\n445\n00:23:11.301 --> 00:23:14.050\n&gt;&gt; Man, this is the hard stuff.\n\n446\n00:23:14.050 --> 00:23:19.510\nI'm hard making decisions in life,\ndon't ever ask if, yes.\n\n447\n00:23:19.510 --> 00:23:20.422\n&gt;&gt; I thought you might like that.\n\n448\n00:23:20.422 --> 00:23:22.036\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n449\n00:23:22.036 --> 00:23:22.991\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n450\n00:23:22.991 --> 00:23:28.120\nwe'll do a little beluga whale action\nhere, let's find a decent size.\n\n451\n00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:30.406\n&gt;&gt; Maybe the one blowing the heart bubble?\n\n452\n00:23:30.406 --> 00:23:30.954\nYeah.\n\n453\n00:23:30.954 --> 00:23:32.200\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There's one with the heart bubble?\n\n454\n00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:33.300\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right by my head.\n\n455\n00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:34.280\n&gt;&gt; Right here?\n\n456\n00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:35.266\n&gt;&gt; Two over.\n\n457\n00:23:35.266 --> 00:23:36.277\n&gt;&gt; Right here, okay.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n458\n00:23:36.277 --> 00:23:37.519\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n459\n00:23:37.519 --> 00:23:46.353\nAll right, so let's take a look at this,\nI'm gonna grab this image, All right?\n\n460\n00:23:46.353 --> 00:23:50.739\nAnd I'm gonna come back over here to my\nSettings app, and then Sign-in options,\n\n461\n00:23:50.739 --> 00:23:52.593\nand then Picture password in Add.\n\n462\n00:23:52.593 --> 00:23:57.097\nAnd I'm going to authenticate Right,\nto make sure it knows who I am.\n\n463\n00:23:57.097 --> 00:23:59.978\nI wouldn't want somebody\nwalking by my computer,\n\n464\n00:23:59.978 --> 00:24:02.500\nlet's say I forgot to lock my screen.\n\n465\n00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:04.990\nSomebody walks by and\nwants to set up a back door.\n\n466\n00:24:04.990 --> 00:24:08.810\nThey could simply go into Settings, try\nto set up a picture password without me\n\n467\n00:24:08.810 --> 00:24:10.840\nknowing it, and\nthen they could come back and\n\n468\n00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:14.350\nlog in as me later on, right,\ncuz they would know that picture password.\n\n469\n00:24:14.350 --> 00:24:18.640\nSo that's why it asked me to prove who\nI am before I'm able to set this up.\n\n470\n00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:21.360\nChoose picture, and I'll go browse and\n\n471\n00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:27.160\nfind that picture real quick, which\nI don't know where it went, Cherokee.\n\n472\n00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:29.030\nWhere did beluga whale go?\n\n473\n00:24:29.030 --> 00:24:29.860\n&gt;&gt; Downloads folder?\n\n474\n00:24:29.860 --> 00:24:31.270\n&gt;&gt; He probably went into Downloads,\ndidn't he?\n\n475\n00:24:31.270 --> 00:24:34.620\nIt didn't put him in my images,\nyou are right.\n\n476\n00:24:34.620 --> 00:24:35.386\nIs that it?\n\n477\n00:24:35.386 --> 00:24:36.361\n&gt;&gt; I don't know.\n\n478\n00:24:36.361 --> 00:24:39.340\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, let's try it and see.\n\n479\n00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:40.277\nThat is not it.\n\n480\n00:24:42.294 --> 00:24:45.244\nIt's one of those days where nothing\nreally seems to be going the way\n\n481\n00:24:45.244 --> 00:24:45.850\nyou expect.\n\n482\n00:24:45.850 --> 00:24:46.780\nAll right, I tell you what we're gonna do.\n\n483\n00:24:46.780 --> 00:24:50.222\nWe're gonna grab this picture of the\nlighthouse instead of the beluga whale.\n\n484\n00:24:50.222 --> 00:24:50.772\n&gt;&gt; That's just as nice.\n\n485\n00:24:50.772 --> 00:24:51.605\n&gt;&gt; I'm sorry.\n\n486\n00:24:51.605 --> 00:24:52.676\n&gt;&gt; Not really, but, okay.\n\n487\n00:24:52.676 --> 00:24:53.990\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n488\n00:24:53.990 --> 00:24:57.170\nit asked me if I want to use this picture,\nand I can move it around.\n\n489\n00:24:57.170 --> 00:24:59.238\nIf the picture was too large,\nI could try to,\n\n490\n00:24:59.238 --> 00:25:02.900\nyou can see I can slide this kind of left\nor right, it's a really large picture.\n\n491\n00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:03.760\nYou can move it around,\n\n492\n00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:07.810\nget whatever it is you want centered,\nand then choose Use this picture.\n\n493\n00:25:07.810 --> 00:25:09.520\nNow I've got to do three gestures.\n\n494\n00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:12.480\nYou'll see the numbers 1, 2, or\n3 over here, with the \"1\" lit up.\n\n495\n00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:18.040\nAgain, they can be lines,\ncircles, or dots, or taps.\n\n496\n00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:21.296\nSo I might do something like this,\nI might circle,\n\n497\n00:25:21.296 --> 00:25:25.712\nI'm gonna do what I, I'll tell you\nlater this is not the way to do it.\n\n498\n00:25:25.712 --> 00:25:27.568\nI don't know if you can\nsee that on the screen,\n\n499\n00:25:27.568 --> 00:25:29.062\nI circled the top of the lighthouse.\n\n500\n00:25:29.062 --> 00:25:34.650\nI'm gonna do a line from top\nto bottom down that flag pole,\n\n501\n00:25:34.650 --> 00:25:36.518\nand then I'm just going to,\n\n502\n00:25:36.518 --> 00:25:41.110\nI don't know, let me tap this\npalm tree over here, all right?\n\n503\n00:25:41.110 --> 00:25:45.400\nAnd then it wants me to repeat it\nto make sure it knows, and I know,\n\n504\n00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:48.170\nwhat I was doing, right?\n\n505\n00:25:48.170 --> 00:25:52.040\nAnd if I can successfully repeat it,\nthat is now my picture password.\n\n506\n00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:56.927\nI'll click Finish, And\nI will close this window, and\n\n507\n00:25:56.927 --> 00:26:03.744\nI'll log Which I just realized I have\na half a dozen virtual machines running.\n\n508\n00:26:03.744 --> 00:26:05.426\n&gt;&gt; Which is not gonna be good.\n\n509\n00:26:05.426 --> 00:26:08.207\n&gt;&gt; I can hear them screaming\nin the background.\n\n510\n00:26:08.207 --> 00:26:09.745\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n511\n00:26:09.745 --> 00:26:11.646\n&gt;&gt; Tell you what, all right, and\n\n512\n00:26:11.646 --> 00:26:12.450\nthere we go.\n\n513\n00:26:12.450 --> 00:26:15.962\nNotice it comes right to that\npicture when I go to sign in.\n\n514\n00:26:15.962 --> 00:26:16.839\nI can choose.\n\n515\n00:26:16.839 --> 00:26:21.667\nI've set up, remember on our other\nepisode, we've set up fingerprints, so\n\n516\n00:26:21.667 --> 00:26:24.340\nI can switch over to Fingerprints.\n\n517\n00:26:24.340 --> 00:26:27.230\nI can do, we didn't do the virtual\nsmart card on this machine, so\n\n518\n00:26:27.230 --> 00:26:28.600\nthat doesn't show up.\n\n519\n00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:32.709\nI could do PIN, if I set up a PIN,\nand now I've got the new option for\n\n520\n00:26:32.709 --> 00:26:33.967\npicture password.\n\n521\n00:26:33.967 --> 00:26:38.698\nSo if I select that,\nas long as I can repeat my gestures.\n\n522\n00:26:38.698 --> 00:26:43.859\nI'm gonna circle the lighthouse, I'm\ngonna go top to bottom on the flagpole,\n\n523\n00:26:43.859 --> 00:26:49.070\nand I'm gonna tap that left palm tree,\nand there we go, I'm logged in.\n\n524\n00:26:49.070 --> 00:26:51.088\nSo that's the idea [LAUGH], there's my-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] On your desktop.\n\n525\n00:26:51.088 --> 00:26:55.320\n&gt;&gt; There's our little beluga whale\nright there on our desktop, great.\n\n526\n00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:56.870\nSo that's the idea behind\na picture password.\n\n527\n00:26:56.870 --> 00:27:00.090\nAgain, you don't use these\nin domain environments.\n\n528\n00:27:02.380 --> 00:27:07.200\nThey're actually more secure than\npasswords, that's the theory anyway.\n\n529\n00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:09.750\nBecause there's an infinite\nnumber of possibilities, right?\n\n530\n00:27:09.750 --> 00:27:13.720\n&gt;&gt; Except if we choose a hedge maze photo,\nwe were talking about that.\n\n531\n00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:17.390\n&gt;&gt; And that becomes the problem, there's\ntwo big issues with picture passwords.\n\n532\n00:27:18.490 --> 00:27:20.930\nOne is people tend to be very predictable.\n\n533\n00:27:20.930 --> 00:27:25.080\nThey have a picture of a bicycle as\ntheir image, and so what do they do?\n\n534\n00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:27.190\n&gt;&gt; Wheels.\n&gt;&gt; They circle the two wheels,\n\n535\n00:27:27.190 --> 00:27:31.730\nand then maybe draw a line across the seat\nor the handlebar, or tap the seat, or\n\n536\n00:27:31.730 --> 00:27:33.110\nsomething like that.\n\n537\n00:27:33.110 --> 00:27:37.560\nOr like Cherokee and I were talking\nabout the other day, you get a maze, and\n\n538\n00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:40.270\nyou draw the maze in, right, with lines.\n\n539\n00:27:40.270 --> 00:27:43.250\nWell, that's something that the bad\nguys are gonna try, they're gonna guess.\n\n540\n00:27:43.250 --> 00:27:45.570\nThe other downside of\npicture passwords is,\n\n541\n00:27:45.570 --> 00:27:49.440\nif you don't clean your screen often,\nyour smudges can be very revealing.\n\n542\n00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:52.300\n&gt;&gt; Ew!\n&gt;&gt; You will see in your screen, right?\n\n543\n00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:56.200\nYou turn the screen into the sun, and\nyou'll actually see where you circle every\n\n544\n00:27:56.200 --> 00:27:58.341\ntime, and where you line,\nand where you tap.\n\n545\n00:27:58.341 --> 00:28:00.404\nAnd somebody can,\nthey didn't give you the order.\n\n546\n00:28:00.404 --> 00:28:02.678\n&gt;&gt; And\nit doesn't even have to be very dirty,\n\n547\n00:28:02.678 --> 00:28:05.230\nyou could just be eating Cheetos one time.\n\n548\n00:28:05.230 --> 00:28:06.360\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n549\n00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:07.960\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, easy, right?\n\n550\n00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:09.990\nSo, that's the downside,\n\n551\n00:28:09.990 --> 00:28:12.750\nif you're gonna use picture passwords,\ndon't do the obvious.\n\n552\n00:28:12.750 --> 00:28:13.860\nI circled the lighthouse and\n\n553\n00:28:13.860 --> 00:28:17.370\nwent drew a line down the flag pole,\nwell the bad guys are gonna try that.\n\n554\n00:28:17.370 --> 00:28:21.790\nWhat you really should do is I should've\ndrawn a line from the top of one tree\n\n555\n00:28:21.790 --> 00:28:23.280\nto the top of the lighthouse, right?\n\n556\n00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:26.599\nNobody's gonna think about a line trying\nto cross the middle of the sky, or\n\n557\n00:28:26.599 --> 00:28:29.650\njust a circle on the upper-left\ncorner of the picture.\n\n558\n00:28:29.650 --> 00:28:32.718\nDon't put a picture of your family and\nthen circle your kids' faces,\n\n559\n00:28:32.718 --> 00:28:35.171\nbecause again,\nthat's what the bad guys are gonna do.\n\n560\n00:28:35.171 --> 00:28:37.491\nBut enough of that, again, we're not\nreally talking about security here,\n\n561\n00:28:37.491 --> 00:28:38.930\nwe'll save that for Security Plus.\n\n562\n00:28:38.930 --> 00:28:39.990\nI wanted you to see that for\n\n563\n00:28:39.990 --> 00:28:43.550\nWindows 10 authentication methods,\nthey do support picture passwords.\n\n564\n00:28:43.550 --> 00:28:45.560\nIt's just a combination of gestures,\n\n565\n00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:49.850\nthree gestures made up of either circles,\nlines, or dots.\n\n566\n00:28:49.850 --> 00:28:51.368\nAnd I think that covers, well,\n\n567\n00:28:51.368 --> 00:28:55.306\nwe still got a little bit more to do when\nit comes to authentication authorization,\n\n568\n00:28:55.306 --> 00:28:59.041\nbut that covers most of the new methods\nthat we have available in Windows 10.\n\n569\n00:28:59.041 --> 00:29:00.800\n&gt;&gt; I know you have a lot left to go, Mike.\n\n570\n00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:03.523\nI don't wanna be a Debbie Downer,\nbut we are out of time, so\n\n571\n00:29:03.523 --> 00:29:04.740\nwe do need to sign out.\n\n572\n00:29:04.740 --> 00:29:05.990\nI've been your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n573\n00:29:05.990 --> 00:29:06.771\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n574\n00:29:06.771 --> 00:29:09.195\n&gt;&gt;

theories\nstudying for the 70-697 exam.\n\n6\n00:00:18.592 --> 00:00:20.634\nI'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:20.634 --> 00:00:25.533\nIn this episode, we'll continue looking\nat ways we can support authentication and\n\n8\n00:00:25.533 --> 00:00:27.090\nauthorization.\n\n9\n00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.760\nAnd with us today, of course,\nback in studios, we have Mr. Mike Rodrick.\n\n10\n00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.986\nHow's it going Mike?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Another great day in paradise,\n\n11\n00:00:33.986 --> 00:00:34.874\nCherokee.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n12\n00:00:34.874 --> 00:00:36.184\n&gt;&gt; Just working with Windows 10 and\n\n13\n00:00:36.184 --> 00:00:37.635\nauthentication and authorization.\n\n14\n00:00:37.635 --> 00:00:40.146\nAnd yeah, in this one we're gonna\ntake a look at something known\n\n15\n00:00:40.146 --> 00:00:41.132\nas homegroups, right?\n\n16\n00:00:41.132 --> 00:00:43.109\nThey call out on our objectives,\n\n17\n00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:47.708\nbeing able to differentiate between\nhomegroups, workgroups and domains.\n\n18\n00:00:47.708 --> 00:00:51.130\nAnd they call that homegroups and\nwe need to understand what they are and\n\n19\n00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:53.652\nhow we can use them, and\nwhat their imitations are.\n\n20\n00:00:53.652 --> 00:00:55.419\nSo let's start by just defining.\n\n21\n00:00:55.419 --> 00:01:00.054\nWhen we look at a homegroup, a homegroup\nis designed to be an easy way to\n\n22\n00:01:00.054 --> 00:01:04.073\nshare resources amongst computers\non a local area network.\n\n23\n00:01:04.073 --> 00:01:08.781\nSimilar to what we might have done\nearlier with say, workgroups.\n\n24\n00:01:08.781 --> 00:01:12.036\nBut they're a lot easier to set up,\na lot easier for\n\n25\n00:01:12.036 --> 00:01:16.525\na non-IT person or typical home users,\nthink your parents, right?\n\n26\n00:01:16.525 --> 00:01:21.883\nPeople like that, to set up and again be\nable to share resources amongst devices.\n\n27\n00:01:21.883 --> 00:01:24.743\nSo first,\nlet's talk about some of the devices,\n\n28\n00:01:24.743 --> 00:01:26.863\nwhat we have to have for homegroups.\n\n29\n00:01:26.863 --> 00:01:30.267\nIt's been around for a little while,\nit's not new to Windows 10.\n\n30\n00:01:30.267 --> 00:01:34.655\nBut we would need our Windows 10 machines,\nand we're gonna need an IPv6 which\n\n31\n00:01:34.655 --> 00:01:36.953\nis built into Windows 10.\n&gt;&gt; Pretty standard.\n\n32\n00:01:36.953 --> 00:01:39.327\n&gt;&gt; Yep, so we've got IPv6 support.\n\n33\n00:01:39.327 --> 00:01:42.614\nOur machines do need to be\nsynchronized with their time,\n\n34\n00:01:42.614 --> 00:01:45.291\nneeds to be within five\nminutes of each other.\n\n35\n00:01:45.291 --> 00:01:48.280\nOtherwise, they won't be able\nto join the homegroup and\n\n36\n00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.222\nwe do have to have a private network.\n\n37\n00:01:50.222 --> 00:01:53.567\nRemember with Windows 10,\nthe first time you connect to a network,\n\n38\n00:01:53.567 --> 00:01:56.811\nit's gonna ask you, is this a public\nnetwork or a private network.\n\n39\n00:01:56.811 --> 00:02:02.110\nAnd we can only create and\njoin homegroups on private networks.\n\n40\n00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:05.695\nThere's only one per network, so\nif somebody on the network has already\n\n41\n00:02:05.695 --> 00:02:08.302\ncreated a homegroup,\nyou can join that homegroup.\n\n42\n00:02:08.302 --> 00:02:11.562\nBut you will not be able to\ncreate any additional homegroups.\n\n43\n00:02:11.562 --> 00:02:16.054\nYou can delete a homegroup or remove\na homegroup and then create a new one, but\n\n44\n00:02:16.054 --> 00:02:18.002\nonly one homegroup per network.\n\n45\n00:02:18.002 --> 00:02:20.703\nAnd it'll end up generating a password.\n\n46\n00:02:20.703 --> 00:02:22.921\nIt's a very simple wizard\nwe're gonna walk through.\n\n47\n00:02:22.921 --> 00:02:25.990\nIt asks you what resources\nyou wanna make available?\n\n48\n00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.281\nWe don't have a lot of choices, right?\n\n49\n00:02:28.281 --> 00:02:32.449\nIt's really, again,\ndesigned to be very simple and easy, so\n\n50\n00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:35.130\nit's not real granular control.\n\n51\n00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.341\nWe're gonna be able to choose, hey,\ndo you wanna make your pictures available?\n\n52\n00:02:37.341 --> 00:02:41.551\nDo you wanna choose to share your\ndocuments, your music, printers and\n\n53\n00:02:41.551 --> 00:02:44.860\nother devices, media, and\nthat's about it, right?\n\n54\n00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.851\nYou just say, yes or no, if you wanna\nmake those resources available.\n\n55\n00:02:47.851 --> 00:02:51.730\nThis isn't like setting up a share on\nan enterprise network where I have\n\n56\n00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.099\nthat granular control.\n\n57\n00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:57.214\nAnd I wanna give some people read\naccess and other people write access.\n\n58\n00:02:57.214 --> 00:03:00.503\nThis is again, a very simplistic for\nthose home networks.\n\n59\n00:03:00.503 --> 00:03:03.030\nWe don't need that type of control.\n\n60\n00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.260\nBy default, when you set up a homegroup,\nanybody that joins the homegroup,\n\n61\n00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:11.580\nwill have read access to all the resources\nthat are available in that homegroup.\n\n62\n00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:16.500\nYou can change that to read write but\nthat's all we have, either read or\n\n63\n00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.233\nread write, all right?\n\n64\n00:03:18.233 --> 00:03:22.608\nIf the machine is the domain member, like\nlet's say it's your work laptop, that's\n\n65\n00:03:22.608 --> 00:03:26.753\npart of the work domain, you bring it home\non the week at night or on the weekends.\n\n66\n00:03:26.753 --> 00:03:31.623\nYou can join an existing homegroup, but\nyou won't be able to create a homegroup\n\n67\n00:03:31.623 --> 00:03:34.124\nwith a domain joined machine.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so it's cool.\n\n68\n00:03:34.124 --> 00:03:38.813\nI can still lead my double life there,\nmy work life, and home life, and\n\n69\n00:03:38.813 --> 00:03:42.103\nstill have an easy access to both?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely,\n\n70\n00:03:42.103 --> 00:03:44.972\nI use a homegroup at my household\ncuz I have several devices,\n\n71\n00:03:44.972 --> 00:03:48.702\ncouple of media players that I wanna be\nable to get access to the media on there.\n\n72\n00:03:48.702 --> 00:03:52.272\nSo one of my machines at\nhome created the homegroup.\n\n73\n00:03:52.272 --> 00:03:56.181\nWhen I bring my work laptop home with me,\nit's joined to that homegroup.\n\n74\n00:03:56.181 --> 00:03:58.997\nSo I can access,\nI can sit on the couch on my laptop and\n\n75\n00:03:58.997 --> 00:04:01.942\naccess resources that are in\nthe desktop in my office.\n\n76\n00:04:01.942 --> 00:04:05.426\nI don't have to get up and go in there,\ntry to move things with a thumb drive or\n\n77\n00:04:05.426 --> 00:04:06.416\nanything like that.\n\n78\n00:04:06.416 --> 00:04:08.762\nIt's all very,\nvery convenient being able to do that.\n\n79\n00:04:08.762 --> 00:04:09.707\n&gt;&gt; I can see, yeah,\n\n80\n00:04:09.707 --> 00:04:13.182\nlike some kind of rudimentary file server,\nbut for a homegroup.\n\n81\n00:04:13.182 --> 00:04:15.400\nAnd even if you had external drives and\n\n82\n00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.447\na backup set to run more\nfrequently on that machine or\n\n83\n00:04:18.447 --> 00:04:22.409\nsomething like that would be really cool.\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, and sharing files or\n\n84\n00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:24.760\npictures and things like that amongst-\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] real.\n\n85\n00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:25.971\n&gt;&gt; Members of the household,\n\n86\n00:04:25.971 --> 00:04:28.390\nthat becomes really easy\nrather than have to, again,\n\n87\n00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:30.650\ntry to use some type of removable media.\n\n88\n00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:32.261\nSo let's see how we can\ngo about setting it up.\n\n89\n00:04:32.261 --> 00:04:33.514\nJoin me here if you will.\n\n90\n00:04:33.514 --> 00:04:37.366\nI'm on my Windows 10 machine and\nthis is not a member of the domain.\n\n91\n00:04:37.366 --> 00:04:40.377\nLog on with my user account Mike, and\n\n92\n00:04:40.377 --> 00:04:45.438\nI'm going to go to my Start menu and\nsimply type in homegroup.\n\n93\n00:04:45.438 --> 00:04:48.660\nJust gonna open up my Control\npanel applet for homegroup.\n\n94\n00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:50.157\nAnd you see I get this warning,\n\n95\n00:04:50.157 --> 00:04:52.872\nit says, this computer can't\nconnect to a homegroup.\n\n96\n00:04:52.872 --> 00:04:57.701\nYour computer's network location must\nbe set to private, and remember I said,\n\n97\n00:04:57.701 --> 00:05:00.054\nyou can't do this on a public network.\n\n98\n00:05:00.054 --> 00:05:03.872\nSo let me show you a couple of ways\nyou can change this to private.\n\n99\n00:05:03.872 --> 00:05:06.820\nThe first and easiest one is right here.\n\n100\n00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:11.308\nChange network location, I'll say,\nokay, I'll click that, little slide or\n\n101\n00:05:11.308 --> 00:05:12.768\na fly out window comes up.\n\n102\n00:05:12.768 --> 00:05:17.110\nAnd I can say, Yes,\nI wanna allow my PC to be discoverable.\n\n103\n00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:19.514\nBasically flagging this\nnetwork as private,\n\n104\n00:05:19.514 --> 00:05:21.369\nreducing my security a little bit.\n\n105\n00:05:21.369 --> 00:05:25.665\nAs soon as I do that, you'll see\nthis wizard starts going to work,\n\n106\n00:05:25.665 --> 00:05:28.890\nsearching for homegroups on the network.\n\n107\n00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:32.180\nRemember, the reason it's doing this is\nbecause I can only have one homegroup\n\n108\n00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:32.880\nper network.\n\n109\n00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:36.671\nSo at first, it has to see if there are\nany existing homegroups on this network.\n\n110\n00:05:36.671 --> 00:05:40.282\nThere's not, it says there's currently\nno homegroups on the network.\n\n111\n00:05:40.282 --> 00:05:42.832\nSo I get the option to create a homegroup.\n\n112\n00:05:42.832 --> 00:05:45.152\nSo let's do that, let's create one.\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n113\n00:05:45.152 --> 00:05:46.698\n&gt;&gt; All right, I click Create.\n\n114\n00:05:46.698 --> 00:05:48.310\nIt launches a handy dandy wizzard.\n\n115\n00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:50.450\nI'll click Next on the intro screen.\n\n116\n00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:54.661\nAnd here, I can see the libraries that\nI can make available to the homegroup.\n\n117\n00:05:54.661 --> 00:05:59.519\nBy default it's gonna share pictures,\nvideos, music, not my documents and\n\n118\n00:05:59.519 --> 00:06:03.432\nthen printers and devices that\nare connected to this machine.\n\n119\n00:06:03.432 --> 00:06:06.462\nWe're gonna change that, if I want to\nchange it, I hit the drop down list.\n\n120\n00:06:06.462 --> 00:06:07.347\n&gt;&gt; You just let share\n\n121\n00:06:07.347 --> 00:06:08.504\neverything.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, why not.\n\n122\n00:06:08.504 --> 00:06:09.031\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n123\n00:06:09.031 --> 00:06:10.058\n&gt;&gt; And if you didn't want\n\n124\n00:06:10.058 --> 00:06:12.870\nto share something,\nyou'd simply hit that dropdown list and\n\n125\n00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:14.611\nsay, no I don't want to share those.\n\n126\n00:06:14.611 --> 00:06:18.196\nMaybe if it's, like it's your household,\nI might want my children to have\n\n127\n00:06:18.196 --> 00:06:21.330\naccess to pictures and\nvideos that I might have available.\n\n128\n00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:23.696\nBut they don't need to get into my\ndocuments where I have bills and\n\n129\n00:06:23.696 --> 00:06:24.773\nthings like that.\n&gt;&gt; Gotcha.\n\n130\n00:06:24.773 --> 00:06:25.757\n&gt;&gt; I don't want my kids playing\n\n131\n00:06:25.757 --> 00:06:26.373\naround in there.\n\n132\n00:06:26.373 --> 00:06:29.312\nSo you can pick and choose what it is you\nwanna make available to the homegroup.\n\n133\n00:06:29.312 --> 00:06:30.561\n&gt;&gt; You don't have your kids paying your\n\n134\n00:06:30.561 --> 00:06:31.318\nbills for you?\n&gt;&gt; Not\n\n135\n00:06:31.318 --> 00:06:31.980\nyet.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n136\n00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:32.795\n&gt;&gt; Soon, right?\n\n137\n00:06:32.795 --> 00:06:34.871\nSoon as they're old enough\nto push that lawn mower,\n\n138\n00:06:34.871 --> 00:06:36.389\nthey could start earning some money.\n\n139\n00:06:36.389 --> 00:06:39.822\nAll right, we'll go ahead and click Next.\n\n140\n00:06:39.822 --> 00:06:42.441\nAnd it goes through the process\nof creating the homegroup.\n\n141\n00:06:42.441 --> 00:06:44.961\nAnd then it generates this password.\n\n142\n00:06:44.961 --> 00:06:49.720\nThis password is what other people\nwould need to join my homegroup.\n\n143\n00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:51.044\nOnce I get this setup,\n\n144\n00:06:51.044 --> 00:06:55.715\nany other devices on my network that\nsupport homegroup can browse the network,\n\n145\n00:06:55.715 --> 00:06:59.639\nfind the homegroup, enter in this\npassword and they'll join in.\n\n146\n00:06:59.639 --> 00:07:01.191\nAnd remember, by default,\n\n147\n00:07:01.191 --> 00:07:05.560\neverybody has read access with anything\nthat's shared within the homegroup.\n\n148\n00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:09.900\nYou don't have that granular control like\nwe might with shares we're used to using\n\n149\n00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:12.142\nin an Enterprise environment, alright?\n\n150\n00:07:12.142 --> 00:07:16.413\nYou really should print this password out,\nI'm not going to and I'll show you why.\n\n151\n00:07:16.413 --> 00:07:17.660\nWe will go ahead and click Finish.\n\n152\n00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:20.667\nAnd once you've finished,\n\n153\n00:07:20.667 --> 00:07:23.614\nyou will see my control panel\napplet has changed a little bit.\n\n154\n00:07:23.614 --> 00:07:26.540\nIt is showing me what I have\nmade available, libraries and\n\n155\n00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:30.680\ndevices you're sharing from this computer,\nand I can see those here.\n\n156\n00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:33.834\nIf I am not happy with that,\nI can always click change,\n\n157\n00:07:33.834 --> 00:07:36.661\nmaybe I decide I do wanna\nmake videos available.\n\n158\n00:07:36.661 --> 00:07:41.132\nI can simply change that to shared,\nand click Next and Finish.\n\n159\n00:07:41.132 --> 00:07:43.113\nAnd now, videos is included in the list.\n\n160\n00:07:43.113 --> 00:07:47.072\nSo easy to change what it is you wanna\nmake available to that homegroup.\n\n161\n00:07:47.072 --> 00:07:51.497\nAlso there is a link here for allow all\ndevices on this network such as TVs and\n\n162\n00:07:51.497 --> 00:07:54.521\ngame consoles to play my shared content.\n&gt;&gt; That's pretty cool.\n\n163\n00:07:54.521 --> 00:07:56.363\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so if you got a Xbox or\n\n164\n00:07:56.363 --> 00:07:58.608\nsome other type of media player,\n\n165\n00:07:58.608 --> 00:08:03.274\nyou cannot give access to your media\nfiles On your computer, right?\n\n166\n00:08:03.274 --> 00:08:06.014\nRight below there,\nother home group options, view or\n\n167\n00:08:06.014 --> 00:08:08.020\nprint the home group password.\n\n168\n00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:11.380\nSo if I wanted to print that out and then\ngive it to somebody else in the house so\n\n169\n00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:13.920\nthey could enter that,\ntape it on their fridge.\n\n170\n00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:16.560\nAgain, this is not a super\nhigh security thing.\n\n171\n00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:19.930\nJust keep in mind that the password\nis what you use to control access.\n\n172\n00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:23.000\nSo don't like but I don't know,\nshare with the world-\n\n173\n00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:23.699\n&gt;&gt; Get crazy with it, yeah.\n\n174\n00:08:23.699 --> 00:08:24.440\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I mean,\n\n175\n00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:28.010\nyou would have to be on the local network\nto have physical access to the network\n\n176\n00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:33.090\nto join the home group, but still not\na good idea to share passwords, right?\n\n177\n00:08:33.090 --> 00:08:35.560\nBut I can also change the password.\n\n178\n00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:38.720\nWhich I'm gonna do, because I didn't\nwrite that other password down.\n\n179\n00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:41.340\nSo let me change that\npassword to something I know,\n\n180\n00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:43.430\nall right.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n181\n00:08:43.430 --> 00:08:47.730\nit's just typing it in plain text there.\n&gt;&gt; Yep, it's defiitely not secure, right?\n\n182\n00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:49.100\nAnybody that was looking over my shoulder,\n\n183\n00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:50.513\nthey would have that password.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n184\n00:08:50.513 --> 00:08:51.360\n&gt;&gt; Everybody out there [CROSSTALK]-\n\n185\n00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:52.397\n&gt;&gt; And now we know your password.\n\n186\n00:08:52.397 --> 00:08:54.460\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And that's my favorite password,\n\n187\n00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:56.610\nwith my bank and everything.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n188\n00:08:56.610 --> 00:08:57.974\n&gt;&gt; All right and there we go,\n\n189\n00:08:57.974 --> 00:08:59.920\nI have changed that password.\n\n190\n00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:01.250\nSo, if ever you'll forget the password,\n\n191\n00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:04.960\nlet's see you set this up a couple\nmonths ago, you bought a new device,\n\n192\n00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:07.790\nyou wanna join it to the home group and\nyou forget the password.\n\n193\n00:09:07.790 --> 00:09:12.590\nYou can always come back in here or\nview or print the password, all right?\n\n194\n00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:13.545\nYou can leave the home group.\n\n195\n00:09:13.545 --> 00:09:16.940\nI no longer, maybe I'm getting\nrid of this device and I wanna\n\n196\n00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:21.934\ntake it out of the home group before I\ndo or not doing home group anymore or\n\n197\n00:09:21.934 --> 00:09:25.566\nI want to create a different home group,\nI can leave the home group there.\n\n198\n00:09:25.566 --> 00:09:26.708\nRight.\n\n199\n00:09:26.708 --> 00:09:28.999\nAll right, now.\n\n200\n00:09:28.999 --> 00:09:33.230\nNow that we've got that set up on one\nmachine, a home group's not much of a home\n\n201\n00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:35.199\ngroup without somebody else.\n&gt;&gt; People attached.\n\n202\n00:09:35.199 --> 00:09:36.220\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yea,\n\n203\n00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:38.550\nit's really not a group if it's just me.\n\n204\n00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:41.670\nSo, I'm going to go over\nto Melissa's computer and\n\n205\n00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:45.150\nshe wants to join that home group so\nwe can share resources.\n\n206\n00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:48.820\nSo Melissa's is going to go to her\nControl Panel or go to her Start Menu.\n\n207\n00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:55.436\nType in Homegroup and\nlaunch that Control Panel applet.\n\n208\n00:09:55.436 --> 00:09:57.260\nSame thing, right.\n\n209\n00:09:57.260 --> 00:10:00.980\nShe has stated the network has to\nbe set to Private which it's not.\n\n210\n00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:04.600\nLast time I used this link right here,\nwhich is definitely the easiest way.\n\n211\n00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:06.070\nLet me show you just in case.\n\n212\n00:10:06.070 --> 00:10:07.670\nYou can always go into your network and\ninternet.\n\n213\n00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:13.500\nFind the network adapter you're currently\nusing to connect to this network,\n\n214\n00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:17.590\nclick on it, and change the profile here.\n\n215\n00:10:18.950 --> 00:10:22.620\nJust another way of setting that\npublic and private setting.\n\n216\n00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:28.260\nNow that I've changed my network\nto private, it says, hey,\n\n217\n00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:31.350\nlet me see if there's any home\ngroups already on this network.\n\n218\n00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:35.180\nAnd it says Mike on Home01 has\ncreated a Home Group on the network.\n\n219\n00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:37.830\nSo my Create button went away.\n\n220\n00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:40.670\nRemember I can only have\none Home Group per network.\n\n221\n00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:42.790\nSo I can't create one but I can join one.\n\n222\n00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:47.240\nSo if I click Join,\nI will go through a very similar wizard.\n\n223\n00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:49.020\nAnd I'll click Next on the intro.\n\n224\n00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:51.350\nI'll choose what it is I want\nto share with the home group,\n\n225\n00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:53.370\nand they don't have to be the same, right?\n\n226\n00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:56.670\nOne machine might share everything another\nmachine on the home group might not\n\n227\n00:10:56.670 --> 00:10:57.680\nshare anything.\n\n228\n00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:01.340\nI need access to resources but I don't\nhave anything that I want to share,\n\n229\n00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:03.570\nmaybe I choose not to\nshare on all of these.\n\n230\n00:11:03.570 --> 00:11:06.580\nBut to be fun and have a little fun\nwith this I'll share everything out.\n\n231\n00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:08.190\nI'll click Next.\n\n232\n00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:12.580\nAnd then this is where I need to know\nthe password to join the home group.\n\n233\n00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:15.920\nAgain, it types it out there so\nall can see, so make sure.\n\n234\n00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:19.884\nIt's pretty secure,\nyou're on your home network.\n\n235\n00:11:19.884 --> 00:11:24.030\nWe'll click Next.\n&gt;&gt; If the boogieman's looking at your\n\n236\n00:11:24.030 --> 00:11:26.148\npassword, you've got bigger problems.\n\n237\n00:11:26.148 --> 00:11:27.690\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right?\n\n238\n00:11:27.690 --> 00:11:29.320\nAnd we'll go ahead and click Finish.\n\n239\n00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:33.480\nAll right, and\nyou'll get this little warning here.\n\n240\n00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:37.060\nIt's basically going through and\nsetting the permissions and\n\n241\n00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:40.760\ngiving access to the home group to\nwhatever resources you made available.\n\n242\n00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:41.700\nEventually that goes away,\n\n243\n00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:45.740\nand I'm left with the same screen we\nwere looking at on that first machine.\n\n244\n00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:48.140\nSo now I'm on Melissa's laptop and\n\n245\n00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:53.570\nif she opens up File Explorer, you'll see\nI have a new node down here for Homegroup.\n\n246\n00:11:53.570 --> 00:11:55.900\nI can see that Mike is\na member of the Homegroup.\n\n247\n00:11:55.900 --> 00:12:00.720\nSo, I can expand that out and there's\neverything Mike has made available.\n\n248\n00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:02.260\nI can go to Documents.\n\n249\n00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:04.500\nI can see all those documents,\nI can open them up.\n\n250\n00:12:06.530 --> 00:12:08.980\nSure, let's use Notepad, it's a text file.\n\n251\n00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:12.501\nSo, I can open it up but\ncan I make changes to it?\n\n252\n00:12:14.654 --> 00:12:16.440\nAnd the answer would be no.\n\n253\n00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:18.570\nNotice it wants me to change the name.\n\n254\n00:12:18.570 --> 00:12:22.790\nIt's not gonna let me overwrite that\nexisting cuz, like I said, the default is\n\n255\n00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:26.930\neveryone has read permission to\nthose resources in that home group.\n\n256\n00:12:26.930 --> 00:12:29.250\nAll right, so I'm gonna cancel that out.\n\n257\n00:12:29.250 --> 00:12:31.270\nAnd not save my changes.\n&gt;&gt; Interesting.\n\n258\n00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:35.760\nSo there's like an inate protection\njust not in the way that you might\n\n259\n00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:39.120\nbe familiar with if you're used to\nworking from a business perspective.\n\n260\n00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:40.140\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n261\n00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:43.330\nSo, not that you don't have\nthat same granular control,\n\n262\n00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:45.410\nbut That's not what\nthis is designed to do.\n\n263\n00:12:45.410 --> 00:12:51.710\nThis is really designed to be a very easy\nway for home users to share resources.\n\n264\n00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:55.250\nIf you're familiar with work groups, we'll\ntalk about those here in just a minute,\n\n265\n00:12:55.250 --> 00:13:00.710\nbut those are a lot more complex for\na non IT person to try to set up.\n\n266\n00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:02.800\nAll right, so that's a home group.\n\n267\n00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:03.580\nPretty easy to do.\n\n268\n00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:06.140\nThe other thing, let's take\na look at one more machine here.\n\n269\n00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:09.560\nWe're gonna flip over to\nanother Windows 10 device.\n\n270\n00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:12.100\nThis one is a member of a domain.\n\n271\n00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:16.240\nSo let's see what happens when\nI go Home Group on this guy.\n\n272\n00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:18.140\nRight.\n\n273\n00:13:19.510 --> 00:13:22.610\nNotice it says because this\ncomputer also belongs to a domain,\n\n274\n00:13:22.610 --> 00:13:25.750\nyou can 't create your own, I can't read.\n\n275\n00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:29.140\nYou can't create your own Home Group but\nyou can join one.\n\n276\n00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:31.710\nYour device is someone\nelse on the network.\n\n277\n00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:35.150\nNow the reason it's not allowing\nme to join that home group?\n\n278\n00:13:35.150 --> 00:13:37.270\nI've got all these machines\non the same network.\n\n279\n00:13:37.270 --> 00:13:42.360\nSo if we check my profile right now,\nit thinks I'm on a domain network.\n\n280\n00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:45.110\nBecause it can detect\nthe domain controller.\n\n281\n00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:47.760\nSo it's not allowing me to\neven join a home group.\n\n282\n00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:50.150\nBut if I had taken this laptop home.\n\n283\n00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:53.080\nRight, and\nconnect it to my home Wi-Fi network, and\n\n284\n00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:57.430\nflag that as private,\nit would allow me to join that home group.\n\n285\n00:13:57.430 --> 00:14:01.380\nI couldn't create one, but\nI can join one with a domain client.\n\n286\n00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:06.660\nAll right, so that's home groups,\npretty easy to deal with, right?\n\n287\n00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:09.880\nJust have to understand some of\nthe restrictions of home groups.\n\n288\n00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:13.410\nYou've gotta have IPv6, time\nsynchronization, meaning all the machines\n\n289\n00:14:13.410 --> 00:14:17.310\nare joining the home group active\nwithin five minutes of each other and\n\n290\n00:14:17.310 --> 00:14:19.830\nthe network has to be flagged as private.\n\n291\n00:14:19.830 --> 00:14:23.020\nAnd there can only be one\nhome group per network.\n\n292\n00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:28.240\nDomain join machines can join home groups\nbut they can't create home groups.\n\n293\n00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:31.490\nThis isn't something you would use in\nan enterprise environment, designed for\n\n294\n00:14:31.490 --> 00:14:35.240\nour home networks.\n&gt;&gt; Okay so if we do graduate.\n\n295\n00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:36.280\nWhat could we\n\n296\n00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:37.720\nuse in an enterprise environment.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]-\n\n297\n00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:38.930\n&gt;&gt; You mentioned something earlier,\n\n298\n00:14:38.930 --> 00:14:39.950\nright?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n299\n00:14:39.950 --> 00:14:42.900\nwe're gonna talk about workgroups and\ndomains.\n\n300\n00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:43.540\nAnd really,\n\n301\n00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:48.410\nwhat we wanna understand with these is,\nwhat's going on with the authentication.\n\n302\n00:14:48.410 --> 00:14:50.260\nIt's what they call out on the objectives.\n\n303\n00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:53.620\nSo what I've got, i'm gonna minimize\nthose macines for a minute.\n\n304\n00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:57.760\nAnd open up a diagram that I created for\nus to refresh.\n\n305\n00:14:57.760 --> 00:15:01.170\nAnd I know at this point,\nmost of you are probably familiar\n\n306\n00:15:01.170 --> 00:15:05.220\nwith the concept of workgroups and\ndomains, but let's refresh.\n\n307\n00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:07.130\nMake sure we're ready for that exam.\n\n308\n00:15:07.130 --> 00:15:11.850\nAll right, so we talked about a workgroup,\nwhat we have to understand right,\n\n309\n00:15:11.850 --> 00:15:14.890\nif we're troubleshooting this, and really,\nthat's what the objectives are calling out\n\n310\n00:15:14.890 --> 00:15:18.290\nwhen it comes to work groups and\ndomains, is troubleshooting.\n\n311\n00:15:18.290 --> 00:15:19.960\nAnd we've talked about this earlier,\n\n312\n00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:23.740\nwe talked about authentication\nversus authorization.\n\n313\n00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:27.180\nWe said authentication is where\nyou're validating your identity.\n\n314\n00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:31.840\nTypically user name and password, but\nthat could also be biometrics nowadays or\n\n315\n00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:36.000\nPIN or a picture password with\ndifferent ways we can authenticate.\n\n316\n00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.590\nWell, not in a domain environment you\nwouldn't be using picture passwords.\n\n317\n00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:46.480\nBut biometrics or certificates,\nsmart cards things like that.\n\n318\n00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:49.600\nBut what I want to talk about here is\nthe basic authentication process and\n\n319\n00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:50.670\nthe way it is working.\n\n320\n00:15:50.670 --> 00:15:55.507\nWhen we talk about work groups, work\ngroups are a collection of computers on\n\n321\n00:15:55.507 --> 00:15:58.390\na network that are going\nto share resources.\n\n322\n00:15:58.390 --> 00:16:04.106\nWith workgroups, with computers that are\npart of a workgroup There's no centralized\n\n323\n00:16:04.106 --> 00:16:09.682\nauthentication, and that's the key that\nwe need to understand about work groups.\n\n324\n00:16:09.682 --> 00:16:13.342\nEach Windows machine has what's\ncalled a security account manager.\n\n325\n00:16:13.342 --> 00:16:17.277\nA little database, the SAM file is\nwhat we used to call it all the time,\n\n326\n00:16:17.277 --> 00:16:18.162\nSAM database.\n\n327\n00:16:18.162 --> 00:16:20.970\nEach Windows machine has its own SAM file,\n\n328\n00:16:20.970 --> 00:16:24.403\nwhere it stores information\nabout local accounts.\n\n329\n00:16:24.403 --> 00:16:27.350\nSo Mr. Orange over here has a computer.\n\n330\n00:16:27.350 --> 00:16:29.590\nOn that computer is a SAM file.\n\n331\n00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:33.748\nIn that SAM file is information about Mr.\nOrange's account.\n\n332\n00:16:33.748 --> 00:16:35.812\nMs. Blue has her computer.\n\n333\n00:16:35.812 --> 00:16:39.483\nIt has its own SAM file with\ninformation about her account\n\n334\n00:16:39.483 --> 00:16:42.454\nthat she uses to log in.\n&gt;&gt; Is that that tiny little dot on\n\n335\n00:16:42.454 --> 00:16:44.161\nthe corner of the drive there?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n336\n00:16:44.161 --> 00:16:45.281\nthat's what we'll say.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n337\n00:16:45.281 --> 00:16:46.834\n&gt;&gt; We'll go with that.\n\n338\n00:16:46.834 --> 00:16:47.501\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n339\n00:16:47.501 --> 00:16:48.431\n&gt;&gt; All right, and then Mr.\n\n340\n00:16:48.431 --> 00:16:49.901\nGreen down here, same thing, right?\n\n341\n00:16:49.901 --> 00:16:54.383\nSo these three people wanna be able\nto share resources with each other.\n\n342\n00:16:54.383 --> 00:16:56.600\nSo they decide to make a workgroup, right?\n\n343\n00:16:56.600 --> 00:17:00.642\nYou can go into your domain, or\nyour computer name domain options.\n\n344\n00:17:00.642 --> 00:17:02.876\nAnd you can chose to\ncreate a work group or\n\n345\n00:17:02.876 --> 00:17:06.860\nrename your existing workgroup\nas it defaults to workgroup.\n\n346\n00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:10.910\nAnd we can have other\nmachines join that workgroup.\n\n347\n00:17:10.910 --> 00:17:13.649\nBut, here's what you've got to remember,\n\n348\n00:17:13.649 --> 00:17:16.972\nsecurity is all handled\nindividually in a workgroup.\n\n349\n00:17:16.972 --> 00:17:22.546\nThis machine here knows about all\nthe accounts that exist in it's SAM file,\n\n350\n00:17:22.546 --> 00:17:27.263\nwhich at this point is just Mr.\nBlue or Mrs. Blue here, right?\n\n351\n00:17:27.263 --> 00:17:30.943\nThis machine has no idea who Mr.\nOrange is.\n\n352\n00:17:30.943 --> 00:17:36.832\nSo if Ms. Blue wants to share resources\nwith Mr. Orange in the work group.\n\n353\n00:17:36.832 --> 00:17:39.855\nShe's gonna have to create an account for\nMr.\n\n354\n00:17:39.855 --> 00:17:42.731\nOrange and\nput it in that sand file, right?\n\n355\n00:17:42.731 --> 00:17:47.013\nSo she will go into her computer\nmanagement, create a new account for Mr.\n\n356\n00:17:47.013 --> 00:17:47.573\nOrange.\n\n357\n00:17:47.573 --> 00:17:50.905\nBasically, to access resources\nin a work group machine,\n\n358\n00:17:50.905 --> 00:17:53.422\nyou have to have an account\non that machine.\n\n359\n00:17:53.422 --> 00:17:57.639\nLet's say Ms. Blue also wants to give Mr.\nGreen access to resources.\n\n360\n00:17:57.639 --> 00:18:03.500\nShe's gonna have to create an account, Mr.\nGreen in her, oops, [LAUGH] Mr.\n\n361\n00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:06.700\nGreen just had a big lunch, there.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n362\n00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:07.844\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I can't stop\n\n363\n00:18:07.844 --> 00:18:12.003\nthinking about Mrs. Blue in her\nworker group, with a candlestick.\n\n364\n00:18:12.003 --> 00:18:13.707\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, with the keybaord.\n\n365\n00:18:13.707 --> 00:18:16.012\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n366\n00:18:16.012 --> 00:18:17.069\n&gt;&gt; All right, so,\n\n367\n00:18:17.069 --> 00:18:21.080\nnow that each one of these users\nhas an account in this SAM file.\n\n368\n00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:25.650\nMr. Green and Mr. Orange, good access\nresources on Ms. Blue computers.\n\n369\n00:18:25.650 --> 00:18:29.802\nIf she gave them access,\nbut what about Ms. Blue?\n\n370\n00:18:29.802 --> 00:18:33.249\nShe wants access to resources\nup her on Mr. Orange's computer.\n\n371\n00:18:33.249 --> 00:18:36.341\nSame process is gonna happen.\n&gt;&gt; I can see where you're going with this.\n\n372\n00:18:36.341 --> 00:18:39.325\nLike it would seem more\nlike pretty cumbersome or\n\n373\n00:18:39.325 --> 00:18:43.790\nat least having to do a lot of work\nto get that sharing happening here.\n\n374\n00:18:43.790 --> 00:18:45.504\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, here's what's gotta happen.\n\n375\n00:18:45.504 --> 00:18:50.882\nLet me tidy this drawing up a little bit,\nI'm gonna need one more orange.\n\n376\n00:18:50.882 --> 00:18:52.539\nSo in the end-\n&gt;&gt; Nine accounts.\n\n377\n00:18:52.539 --> 00:18:54.607\n&gt;&gt; For these three users, exactly.\n\n378\n00:18:54.607 --> 00:18:58.561\nFor these three users and three devices\nto share resources with each other,\n\n379\n00:18:58.561 --> 00:19:01.363\nthey each need an account on\neach one of the machines.\n\n380\n00:19:01.363 --> 00:19:05.791\nThree users, three computers,\nnine accounts that I'm managing.\n\n381\n00:19:05.791 --> 00:19:10.402\nI might use the same username and password\nfor all three of these, Mr. Blue accounts.\n\n382\n00:19:10.402 --> 00:19:12.261\nSorry, Ms. Blue accounts, all right?\n\n383\n00:19:12.261 --> 00:19:13.452\nBut they're not the same.\n\n384\n00:19:13.452 --> 00:19:16.090\nOne account is stored here, one is\nstored here, and one is stored here.\n\n385\n00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:20.675\nSo even though in the beginning,\nthey got the same name and same password,\n\n386\n00:19:20.675 --> 00:19:22.243\neverything might work nice and easy.\n\n387\n00:19:22.243 --> 00:19:27.063\nIf I change my password here, that does\nnot update the password here or here.\n\n388\n00:19:27.063 --> 00:19:28.196\nThey're separate accounts.\n\n389\n00:19:28.196 --> 00:19:30.009\nSo now I've got to remember, wait,\n\n390\n00:19:30.009 --> 00:19:32.490\nwhich machine did I change my password on?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n391\n00:19:32.490 --> 00:19:33.102\n&gt;&gt; Or I've got to remember.\n\n392\n00:19:33.102 --> 00:19:34.593\n&gt;&gt; I can't even remember my passwords\n\n393\n00:19:34.593 --> 00:19:35.243\nhalf the time.\n\n394\n00:19:35.243 --> 00:19:36.018\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Like that's the problem.\n\n395\n00:19:36.018 --> 00:19:37.159\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and or\n\n396\n00:19:37.159 --> 00:19:40.749\nI've got to change it on all three every\ntime I decide to change the password,\n\n397\n00:19:40.749 --> 00:19:42.307\nadd another machine to the loop.\n\n398\n00:19:42.307 --> 00:19:44.500\nWhat if there's four\npeople on four computers?\n\n399\n00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:48.552\nNow you're talking 16 different accounts\nthat I'm managing and maintaining.\n\n400\n00:19:48.552 --> 00:19:54.714\n10 computers, 10 users, that's 100\naccounts that we're dealing with, right?\n\n401\n00:19:54.714 --> 00:19:57.613\nTen accounts on each one\nof those ten computers.\n\n402\n00:19:57.613 --> 00:20:01.351\nSo workgroups are great\nin small environments,\n\n403\n00:20:01.351 --> 00:20:07.380\nwhen I just have a few machines that I\nneed to share resources with, all right?\n\n404\n00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:12.056\nAs far as the sharing goes,\nthey are different from homegroups and\n\n405\n00:20:12.056 --> 00:20:15.160\nthe fact that there's no password to join.\n\n406\n00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:18.152\nI can simply go to my computer\nname domain options and\n\n407\n00:20:18.152 --> 00:20:22.260\nI can join a workgroup by typing in\nthe name of that workgroup there.\n\n408\n00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:23.280\nThere's no password,\n\n409\n00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:26.852\nI can be a part of the workgroup because\nI'm not giving access anything by default.\n\n410\n00:20:26.852 --> 00:20:29.555\nRemember home groups,\nwhen you join that home group,\n\n411\n00:20:29.555 --> 00:20:33.750\nyou're instantly given read access to\nall the resources in that home group.\n\n412\n00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:37.881\nSo you need a password, you need to\nbe authorize to join that home group.\n\n413\n00:20:37.881 --> 00:20:42.137\nYou have to be given permission,\nwhenever you have to know the password.\n\n414\n00:20:42.137 --> 00:20:46.238\nWork groups says nothing is shared out by\ndefault other than maybe public folders,\n\n415\n00:20:46.238 --> 00:20:47.771\nthere's no password to join.\n\n416\n00:20:47.771 --> 00:20:49.821\nYou can join the work group no problem.\n\n417\n00:20:49.821 --> 00:20:53.447\nYou're not gonna get access to anything\nuntil I'm making an account for\n\n418\n00:20:53.447 --> 00:20:54.823\nyou on my machine, right?\n\n419\n00:20:54.823 --> 00:20:59.150\nIs all the security is handled\non each machine individually.\n\n420\n00:20:59.150 --> 00:21:03.940\nThis computer does not trust\nthe SAM file on this other machine.\n\n421\n00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:09.172\nThat's why we have to have accounts\non each one of those machines, right?\n\n422\n00:21:09.172 --> 00:21:12.868\nNow once you join the workgroup,\nand I created an account for\n\n423\n00:21:12.868 --> 00:21:17.232\nyou on my machine, I can now go to\nthe access control list of a resource.\n\n424\n00:21:17.232 --> 00:21:20.151\nAnd I can give your account\npermissions over that resource.\n\n425\n00:21:20.151 --> 00:21:22.835\nAnd I can be granular,\nthink about your NTFS permission.\n\n426\n00:21:22.835 --> 00:21:28.680\nI got read, write, execute, modify, full\ncontrol, all of those are at my disposal.\n\n427\n00:21:30.250 --> 00:21:35.338\nSo much more granular control\nover that than a home group\n\n428\n00:21:35.338 --> 00:21:40.330\nwhere I just had either read or\nread write, all right?\n\n429\n00:21:40.330 --> 00:21:41.945\nAs you've probably figured out,\n\n430\n00:21:41.945 --> 00:21:44.516\nthis is not gonna work in\na large environment, right?\n\n431\n00:21:44.516 --> 00:21:47.231\nIt's a very small environment,\nI think I've mentioned that already.\n\n432\n00:21:47.231 --> 00:21:51.312\nSo when we get into our larger, in our\nenterprises where I need more control.\n\n433\n00:21:51.312 --> 00:21:55.084\nI don't need to manage\nthat many user accounts,\n\n434\n00:21:55.084 --> 00:21:59.520\nthat's when we move into\na domain environment.\n\n435\n00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:03.812\nAnd basically what we're doing is we're\ncentralizing security and authentication.\n\n436\n00:22:03.812 --> 00:22:08.062\nRather than store the user\naccount locally on each machine,\n\n437\n00:22:08.062 --> 00:22:14.164\nwe're gonna store the user account up here\nin the Active Directory database, right?\n\n438\n00:22:14.164 --> 00:22:18.482\nSo now and when I join the computer\nto the domain and I go to log on.\n\n439\n00:22:18.482 --> 00:22:21.223\nIt doesn't check the local\nSAM file from my username and\n\n440\n00:22:21.223 --> 00:22:23.333\npassword to see if I\ntyped in the right one.\n\n441\n00:22:23.333 --> 00:22:25.320\nIt checks with\nthe Active Directory database.\n\n442\n00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:29.060\nIt says, hey, this guy try to log in,\ndid he type in the right password?\n\n443\n00:22:29.060 --> 00:22:33.732\nAnd my domain controller which is hosting\nmy Active Directory database can verify my\n\n444\n00:22:33.732 --> 00:22:35.852\ncredentials, can authenticate me.\n\n445\n00:22:35.852 --> 00:22:40.493\nAnd send back my access token, and\nauthorize me to log onto that system,\n\n446\n00:22:40.493 --> 00:22:42.480\nif I'm allowed, right?\n\n447\n00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:45.256\nBut I can go to any machine\nthat's connected to the network,\n\n448\n00:22:45.256 --> 00:22:48.794\ncuz any machine can reach out and check\nthe Active Directory database to see if\n\n449\n00:22:48.794 --> 00:22:51.373\nI've typed in the appropriate username and\npassword.\n\n450\n00:22:51.373 --> 00:22:55.973\nSo now I've got one account to access any\nmachine that I've been given permission\n\n451\n00:22:55.973 --> 00:22:57.580\nto on the network.\n\n452\n00:22:57.580 --> 00:23:01.989\nIf I change my password, I only have\nto change it on that one account.\n\n453\n00:23:01.989 --> 00:23:02.599\n&gt;&gt; Cool [LAUGH]\n\n454\n00:23:02.599 --> 00:23:05.629\n&gt;&gt; A lot easier, exactly.\n\n455\n00:23:05.629 --> 00:23:09.758\nWe're talking about in a domain\nenvironment we're using Kerberos for\n\n456\n00:23:09.758 --> 00:23:10.872\nauthentication.\n\n457\n00:23:10.872 --> 00:23:15.540\nTypically we can still use NTLM, but\nKerberos version 5 is the authentication\n\n458\n00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:20.011\nprotocol, the authentication is handled\nagain on the domain controller.\n\n459\n00:23:20.011 --> 00:23:22.410\nWhat we call centralized\nauthentication and\n\n460\n00:23:22.410 --> 00:23:23.510\nauthorization.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n461\n00:23:23.510 --> 00:23:27.567\nthat time offset that we talked\nabout with our homegroups is still\n\n462\n00:23:27.567 --> 00:23:32.139\nequally important or maybe if not more\nhere in our domain setup to have that\n\n463\n00:23:32.139 --> 00:23:35.542\nfive minute offset there.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there definitely needs to be time\n\n464\n00:23:35.542 --> 00:23:38.240\nsynchronization, and\nthat's all handled behind the scenes.\n\n465\n00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:43.193\nOne of my domain controllers on my network\nwill be responsible for sinking times.\n\n466\n00:23:43.193 --> 00:23:46.093\nSo they will always check in\nwith that domain controller and\n\n467\n00:23:46.093 --> 00:23:48.239\nupdate their system clocks periodically,\n\n468\n00:23:48.239 --> 00:23:52.133\nmaking sure that there are no more then\nfive, actually a lot tighter then that.\n\n469\n00:23:52.133 --> 00:23:57.591\nBut there is actual five minute windows\nas far as the time synchronization goes,\n\n470\n00:23:57.591 --> 00:23:58.162\nright?\n\n471\n00:23:58.162 --> 00:24:04.701\nSo again key takeaways here when we talk\nabout homegroups, workgroups, and domains.\n\n472\n00:24:04.701 --> 00:24:08.790\nWith homegroups,\nI don't have accounts on each machine.\n\n473\n00:24:08.790 --> 00:24:12.948\nYou create a homegroup,\nyou make resources available,\n\n474\n00:24:12.948 --> 00:24:17.027\nother people need the password\nto join that homegroup.\n\n475\n00:24:17.027 --> 00:24:21.606\nIt has to be a private network,\nyou only give read or\n\n476\n00:24:21.606 --> 00:24:24.597\nread write, not very granular.\n\n477\n00:24:24.597 --> 00:24:27.772\nWorkgroups, we're talking about\ndecentralized authentication,\n\n478\n00:24:27.772 --> 00:24:32.060\neach machine has its own security account\nmanager, where those accounts are stored.\n\n479\n00:24:32.060 --> 00:24:35.589\nIn order to access resources on\nother machines in the workgroup,\n\n480\n00:24:35.589 --> 00:24:38.683\nI need an account on that other\nmachine in the workgroup.\n\n481\n00:24:38.683 --> 00:24:43.042\nAs workgroups grow, it becomes very\ndifficult to manage because we have a lot\n\n482\n00:24:43.042 --> 00:24:47.481\nof accounts, and they're not the same\naccounts, they're all individual.\n\n483\n00:24:47.481 --> 00:24:51.760\nWith a domain, we're centralizing the\nauthentication to the domain controllers\n\n484\n00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:53.661\nand the Active Directory database.\n\n485\n00:24:53.661 --> 00:24:57.641\nNow I only have one account to\naccess all of the resources made\n\n486\n00:24:57.641 --> 00:24:59.601\navailable to me in my domain.\n\n487\n00:24:59.601 --> 00:25:03.341\nSo that is the differences there.\n\n488\n00:25:03.341 --> 00:25:05.982\nAll right, a couple other things they\ncall, actually you know what Cherokee?\n\n489\n00:25:05.982 --> 00:25:09.822\nI think that, we probably don't\nwanna move on into the next topic.\n\n490\n00:25:09.822 --> 00:25:14.352\nNot quite enough time to hit that.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, we don't wanna rush things.\n\n491\n00:25:14.352 --> 00:25:15.889\nI know we've covered a lot so far,\n\n492\n00:25:15.889 --> 00:25:18.602\nbut that's okay,\nbecause everything is great so far Mike.\n\n493\n00:25:18.602 --> 00:25:21.083\nThank you for that, and\nthank you for joining us, but for\n\n494\n00:25:21.083 --> 00:25:22.539\nnow let's go ahead and sign out.\n\n495\n00:25:22.539 --> 00:25:24.842\nI've been your host, Cherokee Boose.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Roderick.\n\n496\n00:25:24.842 --> 00:25:28.504\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITPro.TV.\n\n497\n00:25:28.504 --> 00:25:34.363\n[MUSIC]\n\n498\n00:25:34.363 -->

Great, Cherokee.\n\n12\n00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:32.910\nThanks for having me back, and\nyeah excited to be migrating user data.\n\n13\n00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.140\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, one of the duties\nthat an IT administrator,\n\n14\n00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.600\nor, well, anyone in IT may have to\nperform at some point or another.\n\n15\n00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.370\n&gt;&gt; Yes at least currently right?\n\n16\n00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:48.190\nThings are changing very fast with Windows\n10 and Windows going to as a service and\n\n17\n00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.860\nwith cloud storage and things like that.\n\n18\n00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:55.400\nThis is becoming less of a typical thing\nthat we have to do but it is something we\n\n19\n00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.840\nneed to be aware of, one, to help support\nour end users, two, for the exam.\n\n20\n00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.611\nSo let's talk about first of all what\nwe mean by migrating our user data.\n\n21\n00:01:03.611 --> 00:01:04.430\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n22\n00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.930\n&gt;&gt; As you use a system,\nyou have your profile,\n\n23\n00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.850\nyour information that you store,\nlike in your My Pictures,\n\n24\n00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:12.990\nyour My Documents, My Videos and\nall those documents.\n\n25\n00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.870\nAnd all the configuration changes\nthat you make to your system,\n\n26\n00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:20.790\nmaybe your background,\nshortcuts you've created on your desktop.\n\n27\n00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.870\nThings like that, that's all considered\nin this case your information or\n\n28\n00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:25.980\nyour user data.\n\n29\n00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:28.157\nAnd we will move users to new systems,\n\n30\n00:01:28.157 --> 00:01:31.980\none of the things we have to deal\nwith is this lack of productivity.\n\n31\n00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:36.956\nOr a decrease in productivity during\nthat transition phase because by\n\n32\n00:01:36.956 --> 00:01:40.030\nusers are now getting this new system.\n\n33\n00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:41.810\nThey've got to go find\nall their stuff again,\n\n34\n00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.950\nthey've gotta recreate all those settings\nthat made them happy using their PC.\n\n35\n00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:47.940\nNow it's all gone, it's all new.\n\n36\n00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.450\nThey're frustrated, or\nthey can get a little bit frustrated.\n\n37\n00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.640\nAnd we try to ease that frustration level\nand keep that productivity up a little\n\n38\n00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.160\nbit by migrating or moving their settings\nfrom their old system to their new.\n\n39\n00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.680\nSo when they get to it it's\nnot all brand new right?\n\n40\n00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:04.806\nSome of that stuff is still there.\n\n41\n00:02:04.806 --> 00:02:08.976\nThey can still get to their maybe they're\ndocuments, they're pictures of their cats,\n\n42\n00:02:08.976 --> 00:02:11.605\nwhatever it is that gets them\nthrough their day at work.\n\n43\n00:02:11.605 --> 00:02:16.269\nSo that is the idea here is to migrate\ntheir settings from one machine to\n\n44\n00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:17.920\nanother.\n\n45\n00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.833\nWindows gives us a tool known as\nthe User State Migration Tool that\n\n46\n00:02:22.833 --> 00:02:27.943\nwill allow us to migrate those user\nsettings from one PC to another.\n\n47\n00:02:27.943 --> 00:02:29.670\nIt's not part of the OS.\n\n48\n00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.380\nIt's something that we're gonna have to\ngo acquire a download from Microsoft.\n\n49\n00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.623\nIt's actually part of\nthe Windows assessment and\n\n50\n00:02:36.623 --> 00:02:38.947\ndeployment kit or the Windows ADK.\n\n51\n00:02:38.947 --> 00:02:42.000\nWe'll just download that,\nget it installed and\n\n52\n00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.982\nthen we can use this user\nstate migration tool.\n\n53\n00:02:44.982 --> 00:02:47.010\nAll right, so\nlet's take a look at here at my screen.\n\n54\n00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.524\nI've got a page from Microsoft pulled up.\n\n55\n00:02:48.524 --> 00:02:51.552\nThis is Download and\ninstall the Windows ADK.\n\n56\n00:02:51.552 --> 00:02:56.502\nYou will have to think about which version\nyou need they do update this as a newer\n\n57\n00:02:56.502 --> 00:02:59.365\nversions of the operating\nsystem comes out.\n\n58\n00:02:59.365 --> 00:03:03.992\nThe latest one at the time of\nthis filming was version 1709, so\n\n59\n00:03:03.992 --> 00:03:09.112\nthat Fall Creators Update if this is\nafter that, you'll want to check and\n\n60\n00:03:09.112 --> 00:03:12.604\nmake sure to see if they\nreleased a newer version.\n\n61\n00:03:12.604 --> 00:03:16.169\nJust make sure you stay current with that,\nthey do have some downloads for\n\n62\n00:03:16.169 --> 00:03:18.190\nthe older versions as well.\n\n63\n00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:23.070\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it kind of reminds me of another\nolder tools that they had, I think\n\n64\n00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:28.010\nit was a while ago, but I don't even know\nif it's on the exam objectives here.\n\n65\n00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:30.639\nBut that Easy Transfer.\n\n66\n00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:33.867\n&gt;&gt; The Windows [CROSSTALK] easy transfer\nyeah that was a decent one right?\n\n67\n00:03:33.867 --> 00:03:38.235\nIf you were just doing a single machine\nespecially in a home environment or\n\n68\n00:03:38.235 --> 00:03:43.026\na small office that Windows Easy Transfer\nis great except for the fact they wanted\n\n69\n00:03:43.026 --> 00:03:47.505\nyou to go buy a Windows Easy Transfer\ncable, which was, yeah, USB cable.\n\n70\n00:03:47.505 --> 00:03:49.930\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But we won't talk about that.\n\n71\n00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:51.840\nAll right,\nI do want to show you one more thing.\n\n72\n00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.239\nLet me see if I can find it real quick.\n\n73\n00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:57.084\nI don't think I've bookmarked it.\n\n74\n00:03:57.084 --> 00:04:01.795\nLet's see,\nthere was one thing I wanted to show you.\n\n75\n00:04:01.795 --> 00:04:04.820\nThis is just Microsoft's docs\ngetting started with the user state\n\n76\n00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:05.638\nmigration tool.\n\n77\n00:04:05.638 --> 00:04:08.730\nAnd somewhere they had a link in here.\n\n78\n00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.600\nLet me see if I can find it real quick.\n\n79\n00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.773\nMaybe this was not the right page.\n\n80\n00:04:14.773 --> 00:04:15.830\nIt was not.\n\n81\n00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:18.780\nLet's check this one real quick.\n\n82\n00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:22.429\nBasically I wanted to show you and\nI don't see the link anymore.\n\n83\n00:04:22.429 --> 00:04:23.620\nYou might find this.\n\n84\n00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:27.130\nWhen you go out and you're looking\nat some of this documentation.\n\n85\n00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:30.780\nIt might point you to\na third party utility.\n\n86\n00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:34.130\nThough on their web pages they'll tell\nyou that the USMT is really design for\n\n87\n00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:36.560\nmigrating multiple profiles, right?\n\n88\n00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.480\nCuz you've got a machine\nthat's maybe shared.\n\n89\n00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.532\nMaybe several people log onto it.\n\n90\n00:04:40.532 --> 00:04:44.350\nOr you're doing bulk\ntransfers of this data.\n\n91\n00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:45.890\nThere's user information.\n\n92\n00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:48.110\nReally, that's what USMT is geared for.\n\n93\n00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:52.179\nIf you're doing a single profile transfer.\n\n94\n00:04:52.179 --> 00:04:56.564\nThere are some third party tools that\nMicrosoft actually linked to from their\n\n95\n00:04:56.564 --> 00:04:59.950\npages and recommended,\nit used to be free, now it's not.\n\n96\n00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:04.914\n[LAUGH] Unfortunately, they charge you for\nthat, so again it's one of those things.\n\n97\n00:05:04.914 --> 00:05:07.400\nI'm gonna show you how to use the USMT.\n\n98\n00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.610\nHonestly, with the way things are going\nnowadays and with cloud storage,\n\n99\n00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:12.699\nwe really don't have that same need\n\n100\n00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:17.110\nat least in our corporate\nenvironment to use things like that.\n\n101\n00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:18.540\n&gt;&gt; I could see it, yeah, as not being so\n\n102\n00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:21.970\nessential because the essential\ncomponents like our files and\n\n103\n00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:27.480\nresources could be stored in the cloud,\nbut things like maybe desktop settings or\n\n104\n00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:33.460\nwhatever are not necessarily integral\nto our job function per se, so.\n\n105\n00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:36.950\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly, I think what we're gonna\nsee is that most of our documents and\n\n106\n00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:38.550\nour data are stored elsewhere.\n\n107\n00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:42.221\nSo migrating a profile from one\nmachine to another with Windows 10,\n\n108\n00:05:42.221 --> 00:05:45.030\nthe way it's going is really\nnot going to be the same.\n\n109\n00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:49.251\nYour documents, that Microsoft's gonna\nrecommend that My Documents are not stored\n\n110\n00:05:49.251 --> 00:05:51.830\nlocally that they're stored\nin One Drive right, or\n\n111\n00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:54.590\nthey're on a file server somewhere.\n\n112\n00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:57.819\nSo with Windows as a service I think\nwe'll see less and less of this but\n\n113\n00:05:57.819 --> 00:05:58.833\nagain I don't know.\n\n114\n00:05:58.833 --> 00:06:01.276\nWho knows what's gonna happen\nwith Microsoft and for\n\n115\n00:06:01.276 --> 00:06:03.510\nthe exam we need to be familiar with this.\n\n116\n00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:05.928\nSo let me jump over to\nmy virtual machines and,\n\n117\n00:06:05.928 --> 00:06:08.844\nwhat I've done is I've\nalready downloaded actually.\n\n118\n00:06:08.844 --> 00:06:12.802\nI already have it installed or\nI'll show you the install process, so\n\n119\n00:06:12.802 --> 00:06:16.090\nyou'll download the appropriate\nversion of that USMT.\n\n120\n00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:20.590\nAnd where did I dump that guy?\n\n121\n00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:26.130\nLet me find it here, where it is?\n\n122\n00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:29.686\nI'm going to copy that,\nI'm just gonna dump it over here.\n\n123\n00:06:29.686 --> 00:06:32.072\nI thought I put it in my downloads but\nevidently not.\n\n124\n00:06:33.847 --> 00:06:35.678\nAll right, and I'll go ahead and run this,\n\n125\n00:06:35.678 --> 00:06:37.671\nalthough I've already\nrun it on this machine.\n\n126\n00:06:37.671 --> 00:06:40.210\nSo you can see that the wizard\nlooks at it a little different.\n\n127\n00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:43.150\nSo again, this is the Windows Assessment\nand Deployment Kit or\n\n128\n00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:46.950\nthe Windows AEK Free\ndownload from Microsoft.\n\n129\n00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:50.540\nThere is a way that you can download the\noffline version, this is gonna reach out\n\n130\n00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:55.230\nto Microsoft and download\nthe components that I choose in here.\n\n131\n00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:59.630\nI'm gonna choose Change just so I can show\nyou what this would normally look like and\n\n132\n00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:01.450\nthis is what I've already gone through.\n\n133\n00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:04.879\nI went through and I chose what it was and\nI wanted to install, so\n\n134\n00:07:04.879 --> 00:07:07.620\nyou can see the ADK is much\nmore than just the USMT.\n\n135\n00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:10.080\n&gt;&gt; It's a lot of different tools and\ncompilation.\n\n136\n00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:15.280\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, if you wanna work with\nWindows PE or if you want to do APV or\n\n137\n00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:18.640\nsome of these UEV templates and\nthings like that, this is the tool.\n\n138\n00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:19.230\nIt has all those.\n\n139\n00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:23.962\nBut I just chose to install the user\nstate migration tool or the USMT,\n\n140\n00:07:23.962 --> 00:07:29.690\nwhich you can see is made up of the scan\nstate, load state, and the USMT utilities.\n\n141\n00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:33.580\nThat way I kept my install nice and\nsmall and quick.\n\n142\n00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:35.630\nSo I've already got that running,\nor excuse me,\n\n143\n00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:38.860\nI've already got that installed\non this machine, right?\n\n144\n00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:43.170\nSo I'll go ahead and cancel out off that.\n\n145\n00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:46.557\nAll right, so\nwe've got Windows ADK installed and\n\n146\n00:07:46.557 --> 00:07:51.621\nI've chosen to install the USMT\ncomponents, I guess, of the Windows ADK.\n\n147\n00:07:51.621 --> 00:07:56.226\nNow that's located where\nit's gonna get installed\n\n148\n00:07:56.226 --> 00:08:01.153\nby the fall SQL and\nprogram files x86, Windows kits.\n\n149\n00:08:01.153 --> 00:08:04.855\nTen, assessment and deployment kit.\n\n150\n00:08:04.855 --> 00:08:08.368\nAnd then user state migration tool,\nso buried way in here,\n\n151\n00:08:08.368 --> 00:08:13.075\nif you take a look at that path there,\nSQL and program files, Windows kits ten,\n\n152\n00:08:13.075 --> 00:08:16.543\nassessment and deployment,\nuser state migration tool.\n\n153\n00:08:16.543 --> 00:08:21.068\nAll right and then of course in there,\nI have my different platforms,\n\n154\n00:08:21.068 --> 00:08:23.839\nwe're working on an AMD 64 in this case.\n\n155\n00:08:23.839 --> 00:08:28.410\nAnd within here, we're gonna find\nthe tools that we need to run.\n\n156\n00:08:28.410 --> 00:08:36.522\nThere's really three primary components\nthat will execute or run with USMT.\n\n157\n00:08:36.522 --> 00:08:40.743\nBut really two, I should say,\nthere's Scan State and there's load state.\n\n158\n00:08:40.743 --> 00:08:41.641\nAll right now,\n\n159\n00:08:41.641 --> 00:08:46.450\nscan state which is in here if I scroll\ndown we'll find there's scanstate.exe.\n\n160\n00:08:46.450 --> 00:08:51.210\nScan state is responsible for\ngathering up all of the settings.\n\n161\n00:08:51.210 --> 00:08:56.412\nSo when you run scan state on a machine\nit's gonna scan the drive or the machine.\n\n162\n00:08:56.412 --> 00:09:00.946\nAnd gather up all that user\ninformation that we want to migrate.\n\n163\n00:09:00.946 --> 00:09:04.174\nIt will look at the different profiles,\nall of the different settings for\n\n164\n00:09:04.174 --> 00:09:05.171\ntheir applications.\n\n165\n00:09:05.171 --> 00:09:10.019\nWhatever it is we are choosing to migrate,\nscanstate is the tool that gathers\n\n166\n00:09:10.019 --> 00:09:14.580\nthat up and stores it and\nsets it aside for migration process.\n\n167\n00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:20.023\nWe run scanstate on the old machine,\nthe one they are migrating from.\n\n168\n00:09:20.023 --> 00:09:23.400\nThen, once we've run scanstate,\ngathered all that information up,\n\n169\n00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:26.070\nwe have to store that\ninformation somewhere.\n\n170\n00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:30.442\nUsually, we're gonna put that on removable\nmedia or a file share somewhere on\n\n171\n00:09:30.442 --> 00:09:35.230\nthe network that we can reach from that\nmachine, and we'll store that information.\n\n172\n00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:36.856\nCuz remember, that machine's going away,\n\n173\n00:09:36.856 --> 00:09:39.050\nso I can't really store\nit on the same machine.\n\n174\n00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:42.010\nRight, and\njust sometimes you might even hear it\n\n175\n00:09:42.010 --> 00:09:44.510\nbe called a side by side installation.\n\n176\n00:09:44.510 --> 00:09:47.030\nSo we're not talking about\nupgrading the operating system,\n\n177\n00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:49.090\nbecause if we were then\nthis wouldn't be necessary.\n\n178\n00:09:49.090 --> 00:09:53.850\nThis is like if I bought Mike a brand\nnew PC and he had his old one and\n\n179\n00:09:53.850 --> 00:09:57.340\nwe were moving or migrating\nthe information to that new computer.\n\n180\n00:09:57.340 --> 00:10:00.392\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and\nyou can do it on the same machine.\n\n181\n00:10:00.392 --> 00:10:04.920\nIf you had a scenario where maybe\nthere wasn't a direct upgrade path.\n\n182\n00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:05.800\n&gt;&gt; Good point.\n\n183\n00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:06.590\n&gt;&gt; Or something-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n184\n00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:08.998\n&gt;&gt; Like that.\nYou can do a migration where you move the\n\n185\n00:10:08.998 --> 00:10:13.600\nsettings off, you upgrade the operating\nsystem and you move the settings back in.\n\n186\n00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:17.258\nYou can even do some hard linking,\nwhere it leaves the files on that physical\n\n187\n00:10:17.258 --> 00:10:20.859\ndisk even though you're getting ready\nto install a new operating system,\n\n188\n00:10:20.859 --> 00:10:24.402\nwe're not going to go into that but\nyou can do what they call hard linking,\n\n189\n00:10:24.402 --> 00:10:26.573\nwhere it leaves the files\nthere on the drive so\n\n190\n00:10:26.573 --> 00:10:29.692\nthat you don't have to go out to\nthe network or removable media.\n\n191\n00:10:29.692 --> 00:10:32.557\nBut most of the time you're going\nto have a share set up somewhere on\n\n192\n00:10:32.557 --> 00:10:33.273\na file server and\n\n193\n00:10:33.273 --> 00:10:36.874\nyou're going to go through this process\nof moving everybodies profiles up there.\n\n194\n00:10:36.874 --> 00:10:40.311\nAnd then, as you roll out new machines,\nyou bring those files or\n\n195\n00:10:40.311 --> 00:10:42.869\nthose settings back down\nusing the other half.\n\n196\n00:10:42.869 --> 00:10:46.450\nThe other half, scanstate, so what's going\nto place all those settings up there on\n\n197\n00:10:46.450 --> 00:10:49.130\nthat file share, or\nwherever we're storing it.\n\n198\n00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:52.637\nLoad state is what we use to\npull that information back down.\n\n199\n00:10:52.637 --> 00:10:57.107\nSo scan the current state of things,\nif you will and then load the state,\n\n200\n00:10:57.107 --> 00:11:00.130\ntake that state and\nload it back into the system.\n\n201\n00:11:00.130 --> 00:11:03.230\nSo load state will run\non their new machine,\n\n202\n00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:07.130\nright when we get ready to pull\ntheir information back down.\n\n203\n00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:11.950\nSo those are the two main components\nthere, scan state and load state.\n\n204\n00:11:11.950 --> 00:11:17.370\n&gt;&gt; And just from experience from those\nMicrosoft exams it's good to understand\n\n205\n00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:19.060\nthe sequence of things right, Mike?\n\n206\n00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:20.727\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; So we can't do one before the other.\n\n207\n00:11:20.727 --> 00:11:22.276\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right yeah,\n\n208\n00:11:22.276 --> 00:11:26.786\nyou can't really load the state if\nyou haven't scanned it yet all right?\n\n209\n00:11:26.786 --> 00:11:30.030\nNow, there's a lot of syntax involved with\nthese, I'm gonna show you some of it.\n\n210\n00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:34.660\nIf you go out to docs.microsoft.com,\nI can even show you that link if you want,\n\n211\n00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:36.720\nwe can take a look at some of that syntax.\n\n212\n00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:39.270\nBut depending on what\nit is you're trying to\n\n213\n00:11:39.270 --> 00:11:41.590\ndo determines what switches you'll need.\n\n214\n00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:45.430\nWe could go from a very simple command,\nto just scan everything and\n\n215\n00:11:45.430 --> 00:11:48.910\ngather it all up and store it,\nto very complex commands,\n\n216\n00:11:48.910 --> 00:11:52.350\nwhere we don't want the local accounts,\nwe do want the domain accounts, but\n\n217\n00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:55.490\ntwo of those domain accounts we're\ngoing to migrate to a different domain.\n\n218\n00:11:55.490 --> 00:11:59.420\nAnd we can get very complex and\ncrazy with this tool.\n\n219\n00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:02.200\nFor this exam, we need to know the basics.\n\n220\n00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:06.210\nWe need to understand how this tool\nworks and what it is we can do.\n\n221\n00:12:06.210 --> 00:12:10.724\nFor the real world, you'll wanna\nexplore some of that syntax if you have\n\n222\n00:12:10.724 --> 00:12:15.313\nan unusual scenario or if you need to\ndo something, like moving account.\n\n223\n00:12:15.313 --> 00:12:20.153\nMaybe we're migrating the user's data but\nwe're splitting our domain into two\n\n224\n00:12:20.153 --> 00:12:24.779\ndomains, so I'm really migrating from\ndomain A to domain B and I want to bring\n\n225\n00:12:24.779 --> 00:12:29.000\ntheir settings over and we can do\nthat with User State Migration Tool.\n\n226\n00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.417\nIt will let us do that.\n\n227\n00:12:31.417 --> 00:12:36.030\nAll right, so we understand the two big\ncomponents, scanstate and loadstate.\n\n228\n00:12:37.210 --> 00:12:40.850\nWe also have a lot of associated files, or\n\n229\n00:12:40.850 --> 00:12:47.520\nconfiguration files that we will use\nalong with ScanState and LoadState.\n\n230\n00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:53.220\nThese files are gonna tell ScanState\nwhere to look to find all those settings.\n\n231\n00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:57.780\nWhat files from my documents it should\nit be copying, if not, all of them?\n\n232\n00:12:57.780 --> 00:13:00.860\nWhat applications we wanna\ngather those settings from?\n\n233\n00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:07.200\nThose are all gonna be in these\nconfig files or these XML files.\n\n234\n00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:09.850\nLoadState will need them\nto put everything back.\n\n235\n00:13:09.850 --> 00:13:14.040\nWhat settings should I see in\nthis data that we've migrated?\n\n236\n00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:15.460\nThat I'm expected to put back.\n\n237\n00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:18.490\nWhat application settings\nam I putting back?\n\n238\n00:13:18.490 --> 00:13:24.240\nWhat configuration do I use to put\nthose settings back, all right?\n\n239\n00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:27.890\nSo let's take a look at\na couple of those files here.\n\n240\n00:13:27.890 --> 00:13:32.850\nIf I'm again inside the amd64 and\na couple of them I wanna show you.\n\n241\n00:13:32.850 --> 00:13:37.020\nOne is this MigApp .xml, all right?\n\n242\n00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:43.380\nAnd it's gonna be a lot easier if I use\nNotepad to display that for you, I think.\n\n243\n00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:47.290\nSo let's do it this way.\n\n244\n00:13:47.290 --> 00:13:51.640\nLet me get a PowerShell\nwindow in the right location.\n\n245\n00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:54.030\nSo we're gonna go into USMT.\n\n246\n00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:58.413\nAnd I am going to open\na Powershell window way down here,\n\n247\n00:13:58.413 --> 00:14:02.799\nthat's not gonna give me my\nadministrative Powershell,\n\n248\n00:14:02.799 --> 00:14:07.197\nI'm gonna need an admin prompt,\nso let me change that up.\n\n249\n00:14:07.197 --> 00:14:12.185\nAnd we'll just navigate directly there,\nwe're gonna say cd c colon\n\n250\n00:14:12.185 --> 00:14:17.600\nbackslash program files x86,\nI gotta remember where this guy ends up.\n\n251\n00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:22.502\nThat is gonna go into Windows Kits,\nall right and\n\n252\n00:14:22.502 --> 00:14:26.854\nthen ten, true test of my memory here.\n\n253\n00:14:26.854 --> 00:14:31.693\nIt's not that your just navigating to\nthe default location where this XML\n\n254\n00:14:31.693 --> 00:14:33.341\nfile is stored, Right?\n\n255\n00:14:33.341 --> 00:14:36.371\n&gt;&gt; Yeah just yeah, when I'm in\na command prompt if I don't want to\n\n256\n00:14:36.371 --> 00:14:39.080\ntype the path out\n&gt;&gt; Every time I've gotta navigate into\n\n257\n00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:40.541\nthat directory.\n\n258\n00:14:40.541 --> 00:14:46.170\nDeployment so let's see where I'm at now,\nlet's go into user state.\n\n259\n00:14:47.301 --> 00:14:54.510\nMigration tool, and then I wanna say\nwe're looking at AMD64, there we go.\n\n260\n00:14:54.510 --> 00:14:58.980\nAll right so again a lot roundabout\nprocess just to make sure I've got\n\n261\n00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:04.160\nan administrative PowerShell window into\nthis folder here, that amd64, all right?\n\n262\n00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:09.920\nCuz we're gonna need this eventually,\nso I figured I'd get that loaded up.\n\n263\n00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:10.960\nAll right, so let's do this.\n\n264\n00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:12.950\nFirst let's take a look\nat a couple of these.\n\n265\n00:15:12.950 --> 00:15:18.597\nOne is gonna be MigUser.xml.\n\n266\n00:15:18.597 --> 00:15:22.688\nAgain, there are several configuration\nfiles when I ran scan state,\n\n267\n00:15:22.688 --> 00:15:26.030\nI'm going to point to\nthese configuration files.\n\n268\n00:15:26.030 --> 00:15:30.540\nAnd these configuration files tell it what\nsettings it's suppose to be gathering up.\n\n269\n00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:37.350\nAbout in this case user I've\nopened up miguser, miguser.xml.\n\n270\n00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:39.590\nSo migrate user right?\n\n271\n00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:42.005\nMid user and if you look through here,\n\n272\n00:15:42.005 --> 00:15:45.637\nwe're gonna see this component\nmigrates by video file.\n\n273\n00:15:45.637 --> 00:15:50.367\nSo this is telling it how to go in and\nfind my video, what that path is for,\n\n274\n00:15:50.367 --> 00:15:55.331\nwe don't have to understand that code\ntrust me, we don't need to know all of\n\n275\n00:15:55.331 --> 00:15:59.189\nthat, but you can read-\n&gt;&gt; It is cool to look in here and\n\n276\n00:15:59.189 --> 00:16:01.024\nsee exactly how that.\n\n277\n00:16:01.024 --> 00:16:03.407\nThis configuration is set up and written.\n\n278\n00:16:03.407 --> 00:16:06.173\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely, and\nbecause it's XML, it's human readable.\n\n279\n00:16:06.173 --> 00:16:09.360\nIt's not like it's in C++ or\nsomething that I'm gonna go,\n\n280\n00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:10.779\nwhat the heck is it saying?\n\n281\n00:16:10.779 --> 00:16:12.932\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I might not understand everything in\n\n282\n00:16:12.932 --> 00:16:15.022\nhere, but\nI can definitely make sense of it.\n\n283\n00:16:15.022 --> 00:16:19.313\nI can see things that I recognize\nthat it's looking for my desktop.\n\n284\n00:16:19.313 --> 00:16:21.377\nHere's my music files, right?\n\n285\n00:16:21.377 --> 00:16:24.940\nThis is the part that migrates my music.\n\n286\n00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:28.609\nAnd the point is we can modify these,\nright?\n\n287\n00:16:28.609 --> 00:16:31.040\nThey're just XML files,\nthey're human readable.\n\n288\n00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:32.549\nSo I can come in here and\nI can make changes.\n\n289\n00:16:32.549 --> 00:16:35.780\nMaybe I don't want it looking for\nmy music.\n\n290\n00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:40.160\nI don't want it copying any of their MP3s\nthat they've chosen to store in there.\n\n291\n00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:41.731\nSo we can modify these files.\n\n292\n00:16:41.731 --> 00:16:48.320\nThere's MigUser, another one we wanna\nlook at might be MigApp, right?\n\n293\n00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:51.980\nThis is when MigUser tells it where to\nfind those user files, my documents,\n\n294\n00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:53.915\nmy pictures, my music.\n\n295\n00:16:53.915 --> 00:16:56.155\nMigApp, you'll never guess what it does.\n\n296\n00:16:56.155 --> 00:16:58.263\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Application settings.\n\n297\n00:16:58.263 --> 00:17:00.970\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH] right,\nit deals with application settings.\n\n298\n00:17:00.970 --> 00:17:06.632\nSo I can see my ProgramFiles(x86),\nProgramFiles32bit.\n\n299\n00:17:06.632 --> 00:17:10.948\nYou can see it's got these variable names,\nbut here's the paths, ProgramFiles.\n\n300\n00:17:10.948 --> 00:17:14.250\nWhat else, a bunch of other locations,\n\n301\n00:17:14.250 --> 00:17:20.450\nwhere applications store their data,\nWindows Live Mail Launched Environment.\n\n302\n00:17:20.450 --> 00:17:22.200\nAgain, does this object exist?\n\n303\n00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:23.270\nDo they use mail?\n\n304\n00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:27.440\nAre there any configuration settings\nthere that I need to copy out, right?\n\n305\n00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:30.220\nThis is how the tool knows to do all that.\n\n306\n00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:33.995\nPowerPoint, Excel and Outlook, right?\n\n307\n00:17:33.995 --> 00:17:38.450\nAnd obviously, all the Microsoft\napplications work great with this.\n\n308\n00:17:38.450 --> 00:17:41.430\nIf you have other applications,\nit might not do so well.\n\n309\n00:17:41.430 --> 00:17:45.691\nBut you might be able to tweak\nthis a little bit to go grab\n\n310\n00:17:45.691 --> 00:17:49.317\nthose settings if you get in here and\nexplore.\n\n311\n00:17:49.317 --> 00:17:51.473\nIt'd be fun trying to\nrewrite their XML file.\n\n312\n00:17:51.473 --> 00:17:56.500\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Let's see what else we wanna look at.\n\n313\n00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:58.336\nMigDocs is another one.\n\n314\n00:18:02.761 --> 00:18:10.110\nAll right, and this is how it finds,\nyou see it does DocPatterns.\n\n315\n00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:14.930\nSo it's a way that it's looking for\nfilenames in particular so\n\n316\n00:18:14.930 --> 00:18:19.900\nwe can exclude certain extensions if\nwe want, or find certain filenames.\n\n317\n00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:21.480\nSo lots of configuration files.\n\n318\n00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:25.455\nAgain, we can go through here and\nwe can modify those if we want to.\n\n319\n00:18:25.455 --> 00:18:29.774\n&gt;&gt; I can see that being really helpful in\na situation, like if you were migrating or\n\n320\n00:18:29.774 --> 00:18:32.804\nmoving from house to house in\nreal life and cleaning up,\n\n321\n00:18:32.804 --> 00:18:36.780\ngetting rid of some unnecessary things,\nthat might be helpful there.\n\n322\n00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:38.890\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, absolutely.\n\n323\n00:18:38.890 --> 00:18:44.660\nAll right, so so far, we've learned\nthat USMT, User State Migration Tool,\n\n324\n00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:49.200\nis what we're gonna use to migrate user\nprofiles from one machine to another.\n\n325\n00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:52.981\nAnd it does work between Windows 10 and\nnewer versions of Windows 10.\n\n326\n00:18:52.981 --> 00:18:57.115\nAgain, make sure you get the most,\nlatest and greatest Windows ADK or\n\n327\n00:18:57.115 --> 00:18:59.560\nthe Assessment Deployment Kit.\n\n328\n00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:03.550\nYou can use this to go to\ndifferent versions, too.\n\n329\n00:19:03.550 --> 00:19:07.170\nLike you can if the destination\nversion is Windows 7 or Windows 8,\n\n330\n00:19:07.170 --> 00:19:12.900\nthere is a switch I can use\nto tell the migration or\n\n331\n00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:17.450\ntell USMT that my destination\ncomputer is not Windows 10.\n\n332\n00:19:17.450 --> 00:19:21.210\nWe're gonna be dealing with Windows 10\nin here, so we're gonna stick with that.\n\n333\n00:19:21.210 --> 00:19:25.720\nAll right, so next thing I wanna do,\nnow that we've got an idea of\n\n334\n00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:31.260\nthe components of the USMT, ScanState,\nLoadState and all of these config files,\n\n335\n00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:35.420\nI wanna take a look at one of the first\nsteps we would do when we start this\n\n336\n00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:40.000\nmigration process, and that is generate\nwhat's known as a config file.\n\n337\n00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:41.867\nAnd I was like, wait,\nhaven't we been looking at config files?\n\n338\n00:19:41.867 --> 00:19:43.833\n&gt;&gt; A config file for config files.\n\n339\n00:19:43.833 --> 00:19:46.610\n&gt;&gt; Yes, we need one more config file.\n\n340\n00:19:46.610 --> 00:19:49.400\nYou really don't have to create this, but\n\n341\n00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:54.080\nit's a good idea because, one, they\ncould ask you about it on the exam, and\n\n342\n00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:57.880\ntwo, it gives me a little bit of\ncontrol over what is getting migrated.\n\n343\n00:19:57.880 --> 00:20:02.890\nAgain, I can dive through those individual\nXML files and I can work with those.\n\n344\n00:20:02.890 --> 00:20:06.980\nBut let's take a look at this config\nfile that we can generate and\n\n345\n00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:09.410\nwhat I can use that for, all right?\n\n346\n00:20:09.410 --> 00:20:11.460\nSo let me clear up my screen here.\n\n347\n00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:17.210\nThe way that we create this is gonna\nbe basically run the tool like\n\n348\n00:20:17.210 --> 00:20:22.290\nwe were going to do a migration, but then\ntell it to just don't do the migration,\n\n349\n00:20:22.290 --> 00:20:26.900\njust create a what if or\na config file if we were gonna run it.\n\n350\n00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:30.930\nSo ScanState is the tool we're gonna run.\n\n351\n00:20:30.930 --> 00:20:35.710\nAnd then I've got to tell it which\nones of those XML files to load up,\n\n352\n00:20:35.710 --> 00:20:39.530\nthe ones that control where to get the app\nsettings, where to get the docs and\n\n353\n00:20:39.530 --> 00:20:40.530\nthings like that.\n\n354\n00:20:40.530 --> 00:20:45.387\nSo -i is gonna be an include,\nor /i, I should say.\n\n355\n00:20:45.387 --> 00:20:50.490\n/i: means to include, and\nwe'll say migapp.xml,\n\n356\n00:20:50.490 --> 00:20:54.920\nand I can't use my tab autofill.\n\n357\n00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:57.490\nI'm so used to PowerShell and\ntab autofill.\n\n358\n00:20:57.490 --> 00:21:01.476\nLet's do a /i:miguser,\n\n359\n00:21:01.476 --> 00:21:05.990\nif I spell that right, .xml.\n\n360\n00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:16.021\nAnd let's do a /i:migdocs.xml, right?\n\n361\n00:21:16.021 --> 00:21:20.097\nAnd then /genconfig: and\n\n362\n00:21:20.097 --> 00:21:24.710\nthen the name I want to create.\n\n363\n00:21:24.710 --> 00:21:27.604\nI'm just gonna say config.xml, right?\n\n364\n00:21:29.630 --> 00:21:33.440\nSo again, I'm running the tool,\nScanState, the first part of USMT.\n\n365\n00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:35.920\nI'm telling it where to\nfind all those XML files.\n\n366\n00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:39.230\nBecause I've already navigated to that\ndirectory, remember what my path is.\n\n367\n00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:43.360\nIf you look at the top of my window here,\nright,\n\n368\n00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:48.880\nI'm in that folder that contains the USMT,\nall the way down to amd64,\n\n369\n00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:52.432\nwhich is why I don't have to put\nthe entire path for these files.\n\n370\n00:21:52.432 --> 00:21:57.319\nIf I were somewhere else and if I hadn't\nnavigated first in my prompt to this\n\n371\n00:21:57.319 --> 00:22:01.053\ndirectory, I'd have to tell\nit where those files were.\n\n372\n00:22:01.053 --> 00:22:02.983\nThat means the full path, C:\\, so\n\n373\n00:22:02.983 --> 00:22:07.010\nyou can see why it's much easier to\njust navigate into the folder first.\n\n374\n00:22:07.010 --> 00:22:07.953\n&gt;&gt; Thinking ahead, Mike.\n\n375\n00:22:07.953 --> 00:22:10.289\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, and\nthen run it from here.\n\n376\n00:22:10.289 --> 00:22:12.222\nAll right, so we'll go ahead and run this.\n\n377\n00:22:12.222 --> 00:22:16.469\nAnd you'll see that it is going\nto generate a log file, right?\n\n378\n00:22:16.469 --> 00:22:19.550\nAnd it's gonna throw it under\nscanstate.log, and that's always good.\n\n379\n00:22:19.550 --> 00:22:21.733\nI didn't change any of the verbosity.\n\n380\n00:22:21.733 --> 00:22:26.123\nYou can do a /v: and\nthen 1 through 13, but no 10 and\n\n381\n00:22:26.123 --> 00:22:30.545\n11, for some reason,\nthere's a couple of skip.\n\n382\n00:22:30.545 --> 00:22:36.017\nBut there's several verbosity levels\nthat you can set, whether you want\n\n383\n00:22:36.017 --> 00:22:40.267\nto make a very small log file, or if you\nwanna get very detailed in that log file.\n\n384\n00:22:40.267 --> 00:22:41.965\n&gt;&gt; Maybe those are the levels\nthat are haunted.\n\n385\n00:22:41.965 --> 00:22:45.592\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right [LAUGH] 10 and\n11 don't count.\n\n386\n00:22:45.592 --> 00:22:46.309\n&gt;&gt; Like those elevators.\n\n387\n00:22:46.309 --> 00:22:47.744\n&gt;&gt; But they gave you 13, so it's awkward.\n\n388\n00:22:47.744 --> 00:22:49.321\n&gt;&gt; 13, yeah.\n\n389\n00:22:49.321 --> 00:22:51.266\n&gt;&gt; All right, so there it goes,\nit finished running.\n\n390\n00:22:51.266 --> 00:22:55.297\nYou see it looks like it's running\nthe migration process, it's not really.\n\n391\n00:22:55.297 --> 00:22:59.655\nAnd it's examining all of the profiles,\nmy domain profiles,\n\n392\n00:22:59.655 --> 00:23:03.870\nLAB\\, as well as my local profiles,\nCLIENT01\\.\n\n393\n00:23:03.870 --> 00:23:07.160\nAnd it's examining all those and\nas well as the computer.\n\n394\n00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:11.600\nAnd then down below,\nproducing the configuration file, right?\n\n395\n00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:16.930\nThere's my path all the way to config.xml,\nand then success.\n\n396\n00:23:16.930 --> 00:23:19.989\nAnd then ScanState return code 0.\n\n397\n00:23:19.989 --> 00:23:24.580\n0's good, 0 means nothing went wrong,\neverything completed just fine.\n\n398\n00:23:24.580 --> 00:23:26.600\n&gt;&gt; So that's the default location, Mike?\n\n399\n00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:28.780\n&gt;&gt; That is, and\nit's your current directory.\n\n400\n00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:31.960\nWherever you're at when\nyou run this genconfig\n\n401\n00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:35.800\nis where it's gonna create that\ngenconfig file, unless you specify.\n\n402\n00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:43.113\nI could have in my command put C:\\users\\my\ncar documents, something like that.\n\n403\n00:23:43.113 --> 00:23:43.836\n&gt;&gt; You could then create a space.\n\n404\n00:23:43.836 --> 00:23:46.720\n&gt;&gt; And I could've put it somewhere else,\nyeah, or on my desktop.\n\n405\n00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:49.148\nAll right, so\nlet's see if we can find that guy.\n\n406\n00:23:49.148 --> 00:23:52.612\nLet's do a little notepad config.xml, and\n\n407\n00:23:52.612 --> 00:23:56.359\nthis is what we've just generated,\nall right?\n\n408\n00:23:56.359 --> 00:23:57.996\nAnd you can see what it's doing.\n\n409\n00:23:57.996 --> 00:23:59.682\nIs this running the tool?\n\n410\n00:23:59.682 --> 00:24:03.887\nAnd it's grabbing those config files,\nMigUser, MigApp,\n\n411\n00:24:03.887 --> 00:24:06.533\nMig whatever else we said to include.\n\n412\n00:24:06.533 --> 00:24:11.510\nAnd it's running through the process, and\nit's saying, this is what I would migrate.\n\n413\n00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:16.520\nAnd I can see, it found my pictures and\nit's set to migrate yes, my documents,\n\n414\n00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:21.650\nmy music, my videos, desktop,\nall shared documents, shared videos.\n\n415\n00:24:21.650 --> 00:24:25.484\nAnd the cool thing is,\nthis is a pretty easy to read document.\n\n416\n00:24:25.484 --> 00:24:26.190\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n417\n00:24:26.190 --> 00:24:27.322\n&gt;&gt; And so if I decided, you know what?\n\n418\n00:24:27.322 --> 00:24:30.790\nI don't wanna do videos, right?\n\n419\n00:24:30.790 --> 00:24:34.070\nBecause they might put stuff in there,\nand videos can be large,\n\n420\n00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:37.400\nthey can take up a lot of space,\nmaybe to my marketing department,\n\n421\n00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:41.658\nI've already told them videos will not be\nmigrated, you're gonna be responsible for\n\n422\n00:24:41.658 --> 00:24:43.460\ncopying those off to remove media.\n\n423\n00:24:43.460 --> 00:24:45.267\nWe don't want them to transfer\nacross the network, or\n\n424\n00:24:45.267 --> 00:24:46.970\nstore them up on a file server,\nthat kind of thing.\n\n425\n00:24:49.628 --> 00:24:55.629\nAll you had to do, is change yes to no,\nit's that easy, right?\n\n426\n00:24:55.629 --> 00:24:58.688\nAnd this is why we generate this\nconfig file in the first place,\n\n427\n00:24:58.688 --> 00:25:01.472\ncuz now I can go through here,\nand I can decide what it is.\n\n428\n00:25:01.472 --> 00:25:07.180\nI don't want any of the shared stuff going\nacross there, so I can put no, right?\n\n429\n00:25:07.180 --> 00:25:08.573\nOr leave it at yes, whatever you want.\n\n430\n00:25:08.573 --> 00:25:13.287\nAs we come down here,\nthere's some more internal stuff,\n\n431\n00:25:13.287 --> 00:25:16.468\nWindows internal timezones, right?\n\n432\n00:25:16.468 --> 00:25:19.047\nMaybe they're not only\nmoving to new computer, but\n\n433\n00:25:19.047 --> 00:25:22.913\nmoving to a new office on the other side\nof the country, or in another country,\n\n434\n00:25:22.913 --> 00:25:25.629\nso maybe I don't want their\ntimezone info migrating.\n\n435\n00:25:25.629 --> 00:25:28.415\nI mean, honestly, I'd rather just\nchange the timezone after the fact.\n\n436\n00:25:28.415 --> 00:25:29.308\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n437\n00:25:29.308 --> 00:25:33.560\nthis is the kinda thing you can do\nwith these config files, all right.\n\n438\n00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:37.562\nAnd I'm not gonna go through obviously,\neach and everyone of these, printing,\n\n439\n00:25:37.562 --> 00:25:41.693\nprint spool information, phone and\nmodem options, well that's very important.\n\n440\n00:25:41.693 --> 00:25:45.190\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I tease, it might be where you're at.\n\n441\n00:25:45.190 --> 00:25:49.694\nHandwriting, tablet information-\n&gt;&gt; A lot of different settings here.\n\n442\n00:25:49.694 --> 00:25:52.682\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and so\nthis is going through and this is all of\n\n443\n00:25:52.682 --> 00:25:57.900\nthe stuff that it's going to migrate over,\nand I know I'm scrolling really fast.\n\n444\n00:25:57.900 --> 00:26:02.603\nI don't expect you to be reading all\nof this or anything like that, just\n\n445\n00:26:02.603 --> 00:26:07.830\nunderstand that it generated this file,\nand now I can make changes to this file.\n\n446\n00:26:07.830 --> 00:26:12.060\nAnd then we'll have to call this file\nwhen we actually run scan states.\n\n447\n00:26:12.060 --> 00:26:16.475\nSo when we would decide to actually load\nup those profiles and migrate them we'll\n\n448\n00:26:16.475 --> 00:26:23.020\npointer to this file so that those changes\nthat we made will be honored, right?\n\n449\n00:26:23.020 --> 00:26:25.930\nSo I'll go ahead and\nclose and save my file.\n\n450\n00:26:27.580 --> 00:26:33.490\nAll right, and now we have our config.xml.\n\n451\n00:26:33.490 --> 00:26:37.081\nAll right, Cherokee now,\nwe're gonna go ahead and\n\n452\n00:26:37.081 --> 00:26:39.620\nlet's see if we can't run this guy.\n\n453\n00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:43.790\nI know we're getting close on time.\n\n454\n00:26:43.790 --> 00:26:47.400\nSo I thought what we would try to do\nis start this migration process up.\n\n455\n00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:48.833\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And then we can break, and\n\n456\n00:26:48.833 --> 00:26:51.323\nthen we come back,\nwell hopefully it should be finished-\n\n457\n00:26:51.323 --> 00:26:51.920\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n458\n00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:57.962\n&gt;&gt; And we have something to look at.\n\n459\n00:26:57.962 --> 00:27:02.898\nAll right, so if I want to What I've done\nis I've already mapped, I shouldn't say\n\n460\n00:27:02.898 --> 00:27:07.143\nmapped, I have a shared folder over\non DC03 called USMT, all right?\n\n461\n00:27:07.143 --> 00:27:10.605\nAnd it's just a blank folder\nover there on a server.\n\n462\n00:27:10.605 --> 00:27:15.116\nI should have write\npermissions There we go.\n\n463\n00:27:15.116 --> 00:27:18.794\nSo I have a shared folder I can access and\nI have write permissions for it,\n\n464\n00:27:18.794 --> 00:27:22.613\ncuz that's where I want to store this\nmigration, or these user profiles.\n\n465\n00:27:22.613 --> 00:27:25.813\n&gt;&gt; Where you're temporary housing that for\nthe transition here.\n\n466\n00:27:25.813 --> 00:27:29.141\n&gt;&gt; Yep, exactly, all right?\n\n467\n00:27:29.141 --> 00:27:33.858\nI tell you what, why don't we do this,\nwe've got a few minutes left, rather\n\n468\n00:27:33.858 --> 00:27:38.718\nthan run the tool, I think what I'll do\nwith these last few minutes is take a look\n\n469\n00:27:38.718 --> 00:27:41.506\nat some of the different switches-\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n470\n00:27:41.506 --> 00:27:42.929\n&gt;&gt; That are associated with this tool.\n\n471\n00:27:42.929 --> 00:27:46.620\nI don't want to run the command and\nhave to say,\n\n472\n00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:50.604\n\" just ignore that one,\nwhat is UE, what is UI?\n\n473\n00:27:50.604 --> 00:27:51.522\nLet's take a look at that first.\n\n474\n00:27:51.522 --> 00:27:55.820\nSo let's do scan state,\nswitch question mark.\n\n475\n00:27:56.920 --> 00:28:02.720\nAnd let's do scan state with a dot\nbackslash with a question mark\n\n476\n00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:04.115\nand get some help there.\n\n477\n00:28:04.115 --> 00:28:05.980\nPowerShell is a little\ndifferent from command prompt,\n\n478\n00:28:05.980 --> 00:28:09.130\nremember PowerShell won't\nload up the executables and\n\n479\n00:28:09.130 --> 00:28:14.390\nscripts without the dot backslash by\ndefault, not like command prompt.\n\n480\n00:28:14.390 --> 00:28:16.130\nAll right, anyway,\nI'm gonna scroll back up to the top,\n\n481\n00:28:16.130 --> 00:28:22.170\nyou can see we've got quite a few\ninstructions from running scanstate/?, and\n\n482\n00:28:22.170 --> 00:28:27.840\nour command is gonna follow the syntax,\nlet's see if I can find an example here.\n\n483\n00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:32.792\nIt's basically gonna be scan state,\nthe destination of where you\n\n484\n00:28:32.792 --> 00:28:37.312\nwant to store the information,\nthe include files, right?\n\n485\n00:28:37.312 --> 00:28:39.242\nInclude all of those XML files, and\n\n486\n00:28:39.242 --> 00:28:42.340\nthen there's a few more switches\nwe wanna take a look at.\n\n487\n00:28:42.340 --> 00:28:45.190\nSo StorePath, you can see the command\nis pretty straight forward.\n\n488\n00:28:45.190 --> 00:28:49.570\nYou could run it with just scanstate and\na destination, and that's it, right?\n\n489\n00:28:49.570 --> 00:28:52.440\nAnd it would run in its default form.\n\n490\n00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:56.481\nStorePath is where we're going\nto store That information.\n\n491\n00:28:56.481 --> 00:29:00.080\nThese are the switches I was talking\nabout, if your target system,\n\n492\n00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:04.753\nif the destination is something other than\nWindows 10 you can tell it, and USMT will,\n\n493\n00:29:04.753 --> 00:29:09.112\nremember there's subtle differences in\nwhere it stores things in the registry,\n\n494\n00:29:09.112 --> 00:29:13.089\nand where it stores things via the\ndirectory from Windows 7 to Windows 8 to\n\n495\n00:29:13.089 --> 00:29:13.940\nWindows 10.\n\n496\n00:29:13.940 --> 00:29:17.690\nSo this will help it understand\nwhat that destination system is.\n\n497\n00:29:17.690 --> 00:29:19.942\nGenconfig we just did, right?\n\n498\n00:29:19.942 --> 00:29:22.062\nWe've ran that to get that config file.\n\n499\n00:29:22.062 --> 00:29:26.750\no is the one that you might use now and\nagain if you need to replace,\n\n500\n00:29:26.750 --> 00:29:31.690\nthis will override existing migration\nstores because it doesn't create\n\n501\n00:29:31.690 --> 00:29:34.510\na folder for each profile, right?\n\n502\n00:29:34.510 --> 00:29:36.880\nAnd it's gonna create one file.\n\n503\n00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:39.940\nJust one file is gonna store\nall of this information.\n\n504\n00:29:39.940 --> 00:29:43.210\nAnd if you've run this before,\nthat file exists, it will fail.\n\n505\n00:29:43.210 --> 00:29:50.359\nSo o will allow you to overwrite\nthe migration information, right?\n\n506\n00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:52.230\nWhat else?\n\n507\n00:29:52.230 --> 00:29:57.932\nEFS is one that you might find\nuseful if your users encrypt files.\n\n508\n00:29:57.932 --> 00:30:02.853\nSkip would ignore the encrypted files.\n\n509\n00:30:02.853 --> 00:30:07.643\nRemember if I'm running this,\nI can't just decrypt Cherokee's\n\n510\n00:30:07.643 --> 00:30:12.990\nfiles in her profile, cuz I don't\nhave the appropriate key, right?\n\n511\n00:30:12.990 --> 00:30:18.690\nSo this says decrypt it if you can, copy\nraw just says, leave it encrypted, copy\n\n512\n00:30:18.690 --> 00:30:22.710\nit, and hopefully Cherokee can decrypt\nit when it gets to the destination.\n\n513\n00:30:23.750 --> 00:30:29.220\nHard link is where I told you earlier we\ncould leave the files on the hard drive,\n\n514\n00:30:29.220 --> 00:30:32.130\nand then reinstall the operating\nsystem without moving the files.\n\n515\n00:30:32.130 --> 00:30:35.170\nI know that sounds twisty but\nthat's what hard link does.\n\n516\n00:30:35.170 --> 00:30:39.880\nDecrypt, if it was able to be decrypted,\nit would just decrypt them.\n\n517\n00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:42.540\nCopyraw says leave them encrypted.\n\n518\n00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:46.565\nSkip would be if you want to not worry\nabout copying their encrypted files.\n\n519\n00:30:46.565 --> 00:30:49.966\n&gt;&gt; And tell that end user, hey, maybe you\nneed to make sure all your encrypted files\n\n520\n00:30:49.966 --> 00:30:52.732\nare stored externally or\nyour in charge of them for this process.\n\n521\n00:30:52.732 --> 00:30:55.715\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, or decrypt them before\nthe process starts, or yes,\n\n522\n00:30:55.715 --> 00:31:00.000\nwe'll move everything but your encrypted\nfiles and you have to move those.\n\n523\n00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:05.537\nEncrypt to encrypt the migration store,\nall right?\n\n524\n00:31:05.537 --> 00:31:09.977\nNot dealing with encrypted files within\ntheir profile, but I'm saying when I do\n\n525\n00:31:09.977 --> 00:31:13.715\nstore all of this data up on that\nfile server, do I wanna encrypt it?\n\n526\n00:31:13.715 --> 00:31:14.327\n&gt;&gt; Mm, yeah.\n\n527\n00:31:14.327 --> 00:31:15.977\n&gt;&gt; Because that's got all of my user's-\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n528\n00:31:15.977 --> 00:31:17.440\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, profiles from that system.\n\n529\n00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:21.405\nSo Cherokee might have sensitive data,\nsomebody else could try to browse through\n\n530\n00:31:21.405 --> 00:31:24.277\nthat store where I've stored\nall of this information, and\n\n531\n00:31:24.277 --> 00:31:26.173\nmaybe get access to Cherokee's info,\n\n532\n00:31:26.173 --> 00:31:30.092\nbecause it's not under my documents\nanymore and protected by those NTFS rules.\n\n533\n00:31:30.092 --> 00:31:31.601\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n534\n00:31:31.601 --> 00:31:35.170\n&gt;&gt; So there's that risk of\nexposing sensitive data.\n\n535\n00:31:35.170 --> 00:31:38.940\nAgain, hard linking,\nwe're not gonna deal with that.\n\n536\n00:31:40.030 --> 00:31:40.840\nWhat else?\n\n537\n00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:45.910\nI'm looking for\nanything that we need to worry about here.\n\n538\n00:31:45.910 --> 00:31:51.420\nThere's the verbosity if you want\nto get more logging information.\n\n539\n00:31:53.630 --> 00:31:55.790\nThese here I want to\ntalk about real quick.\n\n540\n00:31:55.790 --> 00:31:58.298\n&gt;&gt; I saw that at the very\nbottom of your XML file.\n\n541\n00:31:58.298 --> 00:32:00.688\n&gt;&gt; Yes, UI and UE.\n\n542\n00:32:00.688 --> 00:32:02.176\nThese can be very useful.\n\n543\n00:32:02.176 --> 00:32:07.327\nMigrates the specified users\nIf it's a domain user,\n\n544\n00:32:07.327 --> 00:32:12.310\nit's gonna follow\nthe format domain/username.\n\n545\n00:32:12.310 --> 00:32:17.702\nIf it's a local user, it should be just\nthe username, you can use wildcards.\n\n546\n00:32:17.702 --> 00:32:20.478\nYou've got the asterisk and\nthe question mark,\n\n547\n00:32:20.478 --> 00:32:23.710\nto do multiple characters or\nsingle characters.\n\n548\n00:32:23.710 --> 00:32:28.190\nUI is user include,\nUE is user exclude, all right.\n\n549\n00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:32.610\nSo if I want to,\nif I don't use the UI or UEs.\n\n550\n00:32:32.610 --> 00:32:34.450\nIt just does all the profiles\nthat are on there.\n\n551\n00:32:34.450 --> 00:32:35.040\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n552\n00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:38.380\n&gt;&gt; But, many times I don't want to do the\nlocal accounts because it's the built-in\n\n553\n00:32:38.380 --> 00:32:43.500\nadministrator account, that my new machine\nalready has and we run into issues there.\n\n554\n00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:47.960\nIt's time and space that I don't need\nif I'm not migrating those users, or\n\n555\n00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:52.430\nmaybe it was a shared system, and\nI wanna migrate everybody's profiles.\n\n556\n00:32:52.430 --> 00:32:55.400\nBut when I migrate back,\neverybody gets their own machines.\n\n557\n00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:59.260\nSo, I'm gonna only migrate Cherokee's,\neven though I gathered up Cherokee's, and\n\n558\n00:32:59.260 --> 00:33:03.520\nTitus, and Tenicia, and Mike and\nAubrey's in this one file.\n\n559\n00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:06.440\nI could migrate just Cherokee's\nprofile to this machine.\n\n560\n00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:08.530\nAnd just Aubrey's profile to this machine,\nand\n\n561\n00:33:08.530 --> 00:33:10.680\njust Tanisha's profile to this machine,\nall right.\n\n562\n00:33:10.680 --> 00:33:15.410\nSo the UE and UI are how I control\nwhat's included both on the migration,\n\n563\n00:33:15.410 --> 00:33:17.910\nwhen we gather it up in the scan state.\n\n564\n00:33:17.910 --> 00:33:22.880\nAs well as when we put it back with\nthe load state, but keep in mind,\n\n565\n00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:25.910\nthis is gonna make sense after I say it,\nyou're going to go duh, but\n\n566\n00:33:25.910 --> 00:33:28.240\nit's an easy one to miss.\n\n567\n00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:30.368\nIf you didn't include\nit in the scan state,\n\n568\n00:33:30.368 --> 00:33:32.445\nyou can't do it in the load state, right?\n\n569\n00:33:32.445 --> 00:33:37.570\nI need to so typically we're a little\nmore general, we run scan state.\n\n570\n00:33:37.570 --> 00:33:41.677\nLet's get everything, and then just\npick and choose what I put back right?\n\n571\n00:33:41.677 --> 00:33:45.170\nDepends on the logic or\nhow you wanna go about that.\n\n572\n00:33:45.170 --> 00:33:49.022\nYou also have a UEL and, I'm sorry, a UEL,\n\n573\n00:33:49.022 --> 00:33:54.940\nwhich is UE user exclude, but\nbased on a number of days.\n\n574\n00:33:54.940 --> 00:34:00.400\nUEL; and then either a date or\na number, like 30.\n\n575\n00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:05.500\nSo, if they haven't logged on in at least\n30 days, exclude them, if they have,\n\n576\n00:34:05.500 --> 00:34:06.400\ninclude them.\n\n577\n00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:09.775\nSo, I don't have to go through and decide\nwhich ones, maybe I just say, look if they\n\n578\n00:34:09.775 --> 00:34:13.185\nhave logged on in the last two weeks,\nthen I'm not moving their profile.\n\n579\n00:34:13.185 --> 00:34:15.610\nThen probably don't use\nthe system anymore.\n\n580\n00:34:15.610 --> 00:34:18.260\nSo that's what that UEL is for.\n\n581\n00:34:18.260 --> 00:34:23.650\nThe I, I showed you that that's gonna be\nour include config is how we're going to\n\n582\n00:34:23.650 --> 00:34:27.997\npoint it to that config file, that we\njust generated with the genconfig, right.\n\n583\n00:34:29.620 --> 00:34:31.680\nAnd that is most of the commands again.\n\n584\n00:34:31.680 --> 00:34:36.470\nYou saw there's more, I'm just trying to\npoint out the ones that we'll find useful\n\n585\n00:34:36.470 --> 00:34:39.350\nas we run through this, and\nas we prepare for the exam.\n\n586\n00:34:39.350 --> 00:34:41.480\nSo that's a good look at what\nwe're gonna be doing, and\n\n587\n00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:43.070\nwe'll do it when we come back.\n\n588\n00:34:43.070 --> 00:34:44.530\n&gt;&gt; All right Mike, thank you so much.\n\n589\n00:34:44.530 --> 00:34:47.910\nA lot of great information here, but\nyou don't wanna miss this part two.\n\n590\n00:34:47.910 --> 00:34:50.570\nFor now let's sign out,\nI've been your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n591\n00:34:50.570 --> 00:34:51.420\n&gt;&gt;

And yeah, we're back to kinda keep\ngoing where we left off with the good old\n\n15\n00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.946\nUser State Migration Tool.\n\n16\n00:00:37.946 --> 00:00:41.605\nCherokee, as we saw,\nwe talked about the different options and\n\n17\n00:00:41.605 --> 00:00:45.214\nhow we were gonna go about using\nthe User State Migration Tool.\n\n18\n00:00:45.214 --> 00:00:48.756\nWe generated a config file\nin our previous episode, so\n\n19\n00:00:48.756 --> 00:00:52.686\nnow we're ready to test it out and\nsee what we can do, right?\n\n20\n00:00:52.686 --> 00:00:54.331\nSee what we can migrate, all right.\n\n21\n00:00:54.331 --> 00:00:58.609\nSo what I wanna do here, if we join me on\nmy screen, I'm actually going to switch,\n\n22\n00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:00.978\nwell, let me just show\nyou what I have first.\n\n23\n00:01:00.978 --> 00:01:03.927\nIf I go to C:Users,\nthis is a Windows 10 machine,\n\n24\n00:01:03.927 --> 00:01:06.013\npart of my domain, I go to C: Users.\n\n25\n00:01:06.013 --> 00:01:10.700\nI'll see there are several\nprofiles on this machine.\n\n26\n00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.377\nAnd I'm only gonna migrate one to try and\nmake this a little bit smoother,\n\n27\n00:01:15.377 --> 00:01:17.801\nmake a little bit quicker in the show.\n\n28\n00:01:17.801 --> 00:01:21.662\nAnd plus I get to use my UE and\nmy UI options to show you those,\n\n29\n00:01:21.662 --> 00:01:24.980\nbut as you can see,\nI do have profiles on here.\n\n30\n00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:26.620\nAnd I wanted to show you,\nlet's take a look.\n\n31\n00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.160\nI guess I could have just switched user.\n\n32\n00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.232\nLet's log in as tanisha.\n\n33\n00:01:38.616 --> 00:01:42.103\nTanisha is our director today,\nso we give her props.\n\n34\n00:01:42.103 --> 00:01:46.694\nAnd this is Tanisha's login,\nshe's got a nice pretty background,\n\n35\n00:01:46.694 --> 00:01:48.763\nI've got a file on my desktop.\n\n36\n00:01:48.763 --> 00:01:51.652\nWe created, if we go into File Explorer,\n\n37\n00:01:51.652 --> 00:01:55.049\nshe's got a couple of\nfiles under my Documents.\n\n38\n00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.304\nI think I put something in Downloads.\n\n39\n00:01:58.304 --> 00:01:59.959\nWe got our kittens and our background.\n\n40\n00:01:59.959 --> 00:02:02.444\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; A couple of pictures there,\n\n41\n00:02:02.444 --> 00:02:04.410\nI don't have any music.\n\n42\n00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:08.214\nI made a fake video, because if I\nremember right, we can double check this,\n\n43\n00:02:08.214 --> 00:02:10.956\nI think on that config file I said,\ndo not copy videos.\n\n44\n00:02:10.956 --> 00:02:11.802\n&gt;&gt; I believe so, that's correct.\n\n45\n00:02:11.802 --> 00:02:12.507\n&gt;&gt; I believe?\n\n46\n00:02:12.507 --> 00:02:13.583\nWe'll double check that.\n\n47\n00:02:13.583 --> 00:02:16.461\nSo I thought I might try to make\nsomething that we don't copy.\n\n48\n00:02:16.461 --> 00:02:19.994\nLet's see if our config file's doing\nwhat it's supposed to, all right?\n\n49\n00:02:19.994 --> 00:02:20.696\nSo anyway,\n\n50\n00:02:20.696 --> 00:02:25.063\nthe point is you've got a profile here\nthat we are going to try to migrate.\n\n51\n00:02:25.063 --> 00:02:28.753\nAnd we're gonna try to migrate this\none but not the other profiles.\n\n52\n00:02:28.753 --> 00:02:31.320\nAlthough I don't know if you'll\nbe able to tell, we'll see.\n\n53\n00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.199\n[LAUGH] All right, so\nI'll show you what I mean, or\n\n54\n00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:37.365\nI'll explain what I mean by\nthat here in just a minute.\n\n55\n00:02:37.365 --> 00:02:39.277\nSo I'm gonna sign out.\n\n56\n00:02:39.277 --> 00:02:42.684\nObviously, the user that you're\nmigrating or users you're migrating,\n\n57\n00:02:42.684 --> 00:02:45.022\nwell they shouldn't be\nlogged in to this process.\n\n58\n00:02:45.022 --> 00:02:49.306\nIt does use volume shadow copy service,\nbut if they're logged in,\n\n59\n00:02:49.306 --> 00:02:52.852\nfiles are in use,\nthey can definitely cause a problem.\n\n60\n00:02:52.852 --> 00:02:56.074\nSo we'll make sure we're not logged in.\n\n61\n00:02:56.074 --> 00:03:00.448\nWe do need to be an administrator\non the machine to run this process,\n\n62\n00:03:00.448 --> 00:03:03.465\nwhich I am now currently logged on as,\nright?\n\n63\n00:03:03.465 --> 00:03:07.297\nAnd I'm gonna open up my\nPowerShell as an administrator.\n\n64\n00:03:07.297 --> 00:03:08.908\nWe could do this from Command Prompt,\nthough.\n\n65\n00:03:08.908 --> 00:03:12.557\nIt's not a PowerShell specific command.\n\n66\n00:03:12.557 --> 00:03:15.143\nYou could definitely do it\nfrom Command Prompt, but\n\n67\n00:03:15.143 --> 00:03:16.978\nyou do need administrative access.\n\n68\n00:03:16.978 --> 00:03:20.265\nAll right, I'm also gonna\nchange over to that directory,\n\n69\n00:03:20.265 --> 00:03:23.431\nsave me some typing later on\nas I'm issuing the command.\n\n70\n00:03:23.431 --> 00:03:32.097\nSo my USMT c:\\Program Files\n(x86)\\Windows Kits\\10.\n\n71\n00:03:33.904 --> 00:03:37.629\nWhat is it, assessment and\ndeployment kit, oops.\n\n72\n00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:44.086\nDo a little Shift+Tab there,\nUser State migration tool and\n\n73\n00:03:44.086 --> 00:03:50.175\nthen what is it, AMD64,\nshould be good, there we go.\n\n74\n00:03:50.175 --> 00:03:53.191\nAnd so I just changed to that directory,\nso now,\n\n75\n00:03:53.191 --> 00:03:58.871\nI'm in the directory that contains the one\nwe're looking for, scanstate.exe, right?\n\n76\n00:03:58.871 --> 00:04:00.947\nThis is the normal default install.\n\n77\n00:04:00.947 --> 00:04:05.446\nIf you changed it, just navigate to\nwherever you've installed the USMT tools\n\n78\n00:04:05.446 --> 00:04:08.321\nfrom the Windows Assessment and\nDeployment Kit.\n\n79\n00:04:08.321 --> 00:04:12.830\nBut there's scan state and\nthere's, somewhere in here,\n\n80\n00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:14.824\nthere we go, load state.\n\n81\n00:04:14.824 --> 00:04:19.771\nAll right, so\nwe are in the correct directory.\n\n82\n00:04:19.771 --> 00:04:22.517\nNow, we want to migrate those profiles.\n\n83\n00:04:22.517 --> 00:04:25.975\nSo again,\nI actually have a shared location.\n\n84\n00:04:25.975 --> 00:04:32.883\nWe set that up in the last show but\nlet's double check USMT and\n\n85\n00:04:32.883 --> 00:04:36.954\nI know what I'm trying to do there.\n\n86\n00:04:36.954 --> 00:04:43.323\nDCO3/ and\nI keep putting a couple of Cs on there.\n\n87\n00:04:43.323 --> 00:04:46.695\n&gt;&gt; You're just navigating the location\nwhere we kept those files?\n\n88\n00:04:46.695 --> 00:04:50.001\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I wanna make sure that\nthe location is accessible, all right,\n\n89\n00:04:50.001 --> 00:04:53.495\nif we're gonna store,\nwe're gonna migrate this User State data.\n\n90\n00:04:53.495 --> 00:04:56.458\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So I've gotta have somewhere to put it,\n\n91\n00:04:56.458 --> 00:05:00.634\nand I just wanna verify that that\nplace that I want to put it exists.\n\n92\n00:05:00.634 --> 00:05:02.912\nIf it doesn't or\nif you don't have permissions,\n\n93\n00:05:02.912 --> 00:05:04.603\nyou don't have write permissions.\n\n94\n00:05:04.603 --> 00:05:08.347\nYou don't have network connectivity or\nif that thumb drive isn't plugged in.\n\n95\n00:05:08.347 --> 00:05:13.196\nIt's an easy mistake, and so usually one\nof the things I'll do when I'm running\n\n96\n00:05:13.196 --> 00:05:17.641\nUSMT is just verify that I have\nconnectivity to my destination location.\n\n97\n00:05:17.641 --> 00:05:20.927\nYou don't have to if you don't and\nyou don't have connectivity,\n\n98\n00:05:20.927 --> 00:05:22.229\nit will tell you, right?\n\n99\n00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:24.284\nIt will fail and it won't work.\n\n100\n00:05:24.284 --> 00:05:28.095\nAll right, so now that I've got that\nsetup, I'm in the right directory.\n\n101\n00:05:28.095 --> 00:05:32.559\nI've got my location that I have write\npermissions that I wanna store this\n\n102\n00:05:32.559 --> 00:05:33.137\ndata to.\n\n103\n00:05:33.137 --> 00:05:34.178\nWe're gonna run the tool.\n\n104\n00:05:34.178 --> 00:05:39.958\nso scanstate is the name of\nthe tool that I wanna run, right?\n\n105\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:44.793\nAnd then where I'm gonna store\nthis is gonna be \\\\dc and\n\n106\n00:05:44.793 --> 00:05:49.827\nmy c key is just doubling up\non everything, that's crazy,\n\n107\n00:05:49.827 --> 00:05:53.869\ndc03\\, I think I called\nit USMT there we go.\n\n108\n00:05:53.869 --> 00:05:59.785\nAnd then we're gonna do config: oops,\n\n109\n00:05:59.785 --> 00:06:05.353\nit would help if you do switch config:\n\n110\n00:06:05.353 --> 00:06:11.970\nI just cannot type, config:config.xml.\n\n111\n00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:16.560\nNow remember, let's see how I\ncan show you this real quick.\n\n112\n00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:19.426\nLet me just grab another PowerShell.\n\n113\n00:06:21.851 --> 00:06:26.086\nIn the previous I'm saying if there's\na quick way I can show you this,\n\n114\n00:06:26.086 --> 00:06:28.780\nin the previous episode we ran genconfig,\nright?\n\n115\n00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:32.210\nAnd we generated a file\ncalled config.xamount and\n\n116\n00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:35.120\nthat's the file I'm pointing at you now.\n\n117\n00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:38.351\nIn fact, you know what,\nbefore we do this, let's verify.\n\n118\n00:06:38.351 --> 00:06:39.063\n&gt;&gt; Let's check it.\n\n119\n00:06:39.063 --> 00:06:41.057\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and make sure we made\nthat change about the video.\n\n120\n00:06:41.057 --> 00:06:43.570\nCuz I forgot I was gonna do that anyway.\n\n121\n00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:48.190\nSo let's do config.xml, and\nthere's the file that we generated.\n\n122\n00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:49.120\nThis won't exist.\n\n123\n00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:53.490\nYou have to create this by running\nthat genconfig command, all right?\n\n124\n00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:55.698\nAnd we did say My Video, no.\n\n125\n00:06:55.698 --> 00:06:56.423\n&gt;&gt; Cool.\n\n126\n00:06:56.423 --> 00:07:00.600\n&gt;&gt; All right, and Shared Music Desktop,\nlet's add, we'll just leave those.\n\n127\n00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:05.510\nShared Video,\nlet's change that to no as well.\n\n128\n00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:07.330\n&gt;&gt; Mike is saying no to all the videos?\n\n129\n00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:08.800\n&gt;&gt; That's right, no videos.\n\n130\n00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:10.740\nWe're an anti video company.\n\n131\n00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:13.615\nOops, that wouldn't be good,\nwould it, not for ITPro TV.\n\n132\n00:07:13.615 --> 00:07:15.798\nAll right, so\nif my config file does exist,\n\n133\n00:07:15.798 --> 00:07:19.816\nthat's probably another thing I should\ndouble check before I run this command.\n\n134\n00:07:19.816 --> 00:07:27.460\nSo now we're good, we're gonna run\nscanstate.exe and then destination.\n\n135\n00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:31.034\nThis could be a mapped drive,\nit could be a thumb drive or USB drive,\n\n136\n00:07:31.034 --> 00:07:33.313\nlong as you've got enough space, right?\n\n137\n00:07:33.313 --> 00:07:38.630\nIn my case, dc03\\USMT and\nthen /config: and\n\n138\n00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:43.187\nthen because it's in the same directory,\n\n139\n00:07:43.187 --> 00:07:48.390\nI don't have to type out C: and\nthe entire path.\n\n140\n00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:54.402\nI can just do a config.xml.\n\n141\n00:07:56.822 --> 00:08:00.205\nProbably should've given it a better name,\nmaybe something a little more meaningful.\n\n142\n00:08:00.205 --> 00:08:03.467\nBut that's what I happened to call mine,\nconfig.xml.\n\n143\n00:08:03.467 --> 00:08:09.664\nAll right /i:migapp.xml.\n\n144\n00:08:12.193 --> 00:08:18.766\n/ i:miguser.xml, /i:,\n\n145\n00:08:18.766 --> 00:08:23.820\nwhich one am I missing,\n\n146\n00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:29.147\nmigdocs.xml, right.\n\n147\n00:08:29.147 --> 00:08:32.466\nSo those are the different xml\nfiles that I wanted to use.\n\n148\n00:08:32.466 --> 00:08:35.250\nRemember, MigApp tells\nwhere the applications and\n\n149\n00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:37.055\nwhat applications I want to transfer.\n\n150\n00:08:37.055 --> 00:08:41.125\nMigUser for all the user's files\nwhere they're at, what to get.\n\n151\n00:08:41.125 --> 00:08:47.269\nMigDocs for what documents if I wanna do\nany kind of like excluding MDBs, right.\n\n152\n00:08:47.269 --> 00:08:51.849\nDatabases would be a large file type that\nmaybe I don't want to include in this\n\n153\n00:08:51.849 --> 00:08:53.126\nmigration process.\n\n154\n00:08:53.126 --> 00:08:58.719\nRight, then what I'm gonna do is /ue: and\n\n155\n00:08:58.719 --> 00:09:03.565\nif you remember, ue is user exclude.\n\n156\n00:09:03.565 --> 00:09:07.361\nRight, : and I'm gonna do *\\*,\n\n157\n00:09:07.361 --> 00:09:13.830\nokay because what's that going\nto do is exclude everybody.\n\n158\n00:09:13.830 --> 00:09:15.912\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna say,\ndo you remember all these profile names?\n\n159\n00:09:15.912 --> 00:09:17.000\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n160\n00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:17.996\n&gt;&gt; You're going to have to.\n\n161\n00:09:17.996 --> 00:09:20.596\n&gt;&gt; There we go, we just use wild cards,\nright and say, yeah,\n\n162\n00:09:20.596 --> 00:09:21.691\ndon't get any of those.\n\n163\n00:09:21.691 --> 00:09:24.170\nThanks, I don't want user accounts.\n\n164\n00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:27.857\nBut again, most of the times you\nprobably wanna migrate everybody, maybe,\n\n165\n00:09:27.857 --> 00:09:29.690\nmaybe not or just certain ones.\n\n166\n00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:35.570\nBut in my case, I just wanna migrate one,\nso it's easier to exclude everybody and\n\n167\n00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:39.980\nthen include the one account that\nI want to migrate, all right?\n\n168\n00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:47.163\nSo ue exclude everything,\n/ui: and then, in this case,\n\n169\n00:09:47.163 --> 00:09:52.199\nit's a domain account so lab/tanisha.\n\n170\n00:09:52.199 --> 00:09:56.609\nIf I wanted others /ui: I can\ndo as many UIs as I need,\n\n171\n00:09:56.609 --> 00:10:00.836\nto include all the profiles\nthat I want to migrate.\n\n172\n00:10:00.836 --> 00:10:04.910\nSo if I wanted to migrate two or\nthree, I have to do separate UIs.\n\n173\n00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:08.520\nIf I wanted everything, I just\nwouldn't use the UI or the UE, right,\n\n174\n00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:10.040\nI just let it grab everything.\n\n175\n00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:16.730\nAll right, should be all I need to run\nmy tool, so let's just double-check.\n\n176\n00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:19.550\nI've got my program, scanstate.exe.\n\n177\n00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:23.180\nMy destination,\nmy config file that I wanted to use,\n\n178\n00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:26.420\nif you have one, my include files.\n\n179\n00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:30.253\nAnd then what profiles to grab,\nwe should be good to go.\n\n180\n00:10:30.253 --> 00:10:35.136\nSo hit Enter and hopefully, everything\ngoes well now failures you get at\n\n181\n00:10:35.136 --> 00:10:39.394\nthis point are gonna be things\nlike destination unreachable.\n\n182\n00:10:39.394 --> 00:10:44.487\nIf it can't find where to\nstore this migration file,\n\n183\n00:10:44.487 --> 00:10:47.970\nor if it can't-\n&gt;&gt; Lack of storage space.\n\n184\n00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:50.790\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, if there's not enough space or\nyou don't have write permissions, right?\n\n185\n00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:53.200\nSome of those kind of things\nmight cause problems.\n\n186\n00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:54.790\nEncrypted files can also cause a problem.\n\n187\n00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:57.880\nRemember, there were some\nswitches that I could use.\n\n188\n00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:01.835\nWe could use abort which just\nfails if it finds encrypted files.\n\n189\n00:11:01.835 --> 00:11:05.310\nThe skip, which will skip encrypted files,\nthere's an option to\n\n190\n00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:09.270\ndecrypt them if you have the appropriate\nkey, and then you have to provide the key.\n\n191\n00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:12.440\nBut the encrypts of big one\nthat will cause failures,\n\n192\n00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:17.150\ncuz if by default, if it runs across the\nfile and it can't migrate, it just fails.\n\n193\n00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:19.250\nAnd it'll error out, and\nit'll give you the error code.\n\n194\n00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:23.710\nYou gotta go look at that log file and\ntry to figure out what went wrong.\n\n195\n00:11:23.710 --> 00:11:28.040\nAll right, so you can see if you look\nat my screen here, it did skip, right?\n\n196\n00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:32.120\nIt's only scanning Tanisha,\nwell and the computer account, and\n\n197\n00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:34.190\nnow it's gathering data for Tanisha.\n\n198\n00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:39.170\nAlthough, we saw there were at least\nfour or five profiles on this machine.\n\n199\n00:11:39.170 --> 00:11:41.990\nSo that's that user exclude,\nexclude everything.\n\n200\n00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:44.750\nAnd then include just Tanisha,\nin this case, right.\n\n201\n00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:47.650\nThat'll kind of speed up the process.\n\n202\n00:11:47.650 --> 00:11:49.718\nIn fact, it's already got Tanisha done.\n\n203\n00:11:49.718 --> 00:11:53.490\nIt's working on the computer\naccount at this point.\n\n204\n00:11:53.490 --> 00:11:56.305\nSo we'll give it just a second,\nshould finish up.\n\n205\n00:11:56.305 --> 00:12:00.915\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Tanisha didn't have a whole of\nfiles and data going on in her profile.\n\n206\n00:12:00.915 --> 00:12:03.025\nBut I could imagine that\nit could take a while.\n\n207\n00:12:03.025 --> 00:12:04.395\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.\n\n208\n00:12:04.395 --> 00:12:06.415\nIf this was an actual user account.\n\n209\n00:12:06.415 --> 00:12:08.882\nThese were obviously\na little test machines.\n\n210\n00:12:08.882 --> 00:12:13.602\nBut the more data that somebody has,\nthe longer it's gonna take.\n\n211\n00:12:13.602 --> 00:12:17.402\nThe more profiles that you're gathering\nup, the longer it's going to take.\n\n212\n00:12:17.402 --> 00:12:22.162\nThe speed of your network and the size of\nthose migration files, can affect this.\n\n213\n00:12:22.162 --> 00:12:24.681\nThe right speed of\nthe destination up there.\n\n214\n00:12:24.681 --> 00:12:28.743\nIf it's going across the network and\nthen up on that file share,\n\n215\n00:12:28.743 --> 00:12:33.120\ncan also affect the performance or\nlength how long this takes to run.\n\n216\n00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:39.730\nSo tell you what we'll do, we just\nseem to be hung up on this computer.\n\n217\n00:12:39.730 --> 00:12:43.270\nAs soon as I say this,\nit will finish and we'll be right back.\n\n218\n00:12:43.270 --> 00:12:45.090\nWe'll go ahead and\ntake a quick TV timeout,\n\n219\n00:12:45.090 --> 00:12:48.190\nwe'll come back as soon as this\ncommand completes running.\n\n220\n00:12:48.190 --> 00:12:50.530\nAlright, so there we go,\nwe finished, we'll zoom in here,\n\n221\n00:12:50.530 --> 00:12:51.830\ntake a look at my results.\n\n222\n00:12:51.830 --> 00:12:56.713\nWe ran our command, and I can see\nthat it did, got Tanisha's profiles,\n\n223\n00:12:56.713 --> 00:12:58.964\nskipped all the other profiles.\n\n224\n00:12:58.964 --> 00:13:03.650\nSuccess, return code 0, which means\nwe should be good to go, right?\n\n225\n00:13:03.650 --> 00:13:06.973\nSo it ran through,\nit followed all those config files,\n\n226\n00:13:06.973 --> 00:13:10.592\nall the instructions in those\nXML files on what to gather up.\n\n227\n00:13:10.592 --> 00:13:15.388\nNow if we flip back over to where we\ntold it to store this data, right,\n\n228\n00:13:15.388 --> 00:13:19.632\nthe path I put in there for\nthe destination was back on DCO3.\n\n229\n00:13:19.632 --> 00:13:23.065\nThere's a shared folder called USMT,\nright there.\n\n230\n00:13:23.065 --> 00:13:26.775\nSo it knows it created a sub\nfolder called USMT, and\n\n231\n00:13:26.775 --> 00:13:30.672\nthen inside there there's\na file called usmt.mig.\n\n232\n00:13:30.672 --> 00:13:34.467\nNotice there's not a separate file for\nyou to profile or anything like that.\n\n233\n00:13:34.467 --> 00:13:38.360\nIt all gets combined\ninto one migration store.\n\n234\n00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:41.400\nNow when we pull things back\nwith our load state command,\n\n235\n00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:44.350\nwe can specify what\nusers we're pulling out.\n\n236\n00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:49.070\nSo if one profile's going to this machine,\none profile's going to that machine, or if\n\n237\n00:13:49.070 --> 00:13:52.620\nall of them are coming down, or whatever\nthe case may be, we have that flexibility.\n\n238\n00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:55.450\nBut you can't just browse through here,\nthat's my point.\n\n239\n00:13:55.450 --> 00:13:58.970\n&gt;&gt; Which could get a little confusing if\nyou don't have good documentation, right?\n\n240\n00:13:58.970 --> 00:14:02.450\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I don't know whose profile's\nin here at this point, right?\n\n241\n00:14:02.450 --> 00:14:05.480\nIf someone else was just looking at that,\nall right.\n\n242\n00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:09.090\nSo that finished so now to restore, right?\n\n243\n00:14:09.090 --> 00:14:13.090\nTo bring her data, Tanisha in this case,\nover to her new machine.\n\n244\n00:14:13.090 --> 00:14:14.290\nHere's her machine.\n\n245\n00:14:14.290 --> 00:14:17.870\nNow we wanna make sure that Tanisha has\nnot logged on to this machine before.\n\n246\n00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:22.450\nIf her profile already exists, it's gonna\nhave trouble, it's gonna error out, right?\n\n247\n00:14:22.450 --> 00:14:26.120\nIt's gonna say, wait, this data already\nexists, I can't create this information.\n\n248\n00:14:28.010 --> 00:14:33.820\nI did copy over the USMT files to\nthis machine, making sure I put them.\n\n249\n00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:34.940\nThere we go.\n\n250\n00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:36.180\nI cheated in this case.\n\n251\n00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:37.140\nI put them right on the C drive.\n\n252\n00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:42.320\nRemember when I used the Wizard to\ninstall them and it was C:programfiles,\n\n253\n00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:46.530\nWindows kits 10,\nthat whole long varied path?\n\n254\n00:14:46.530 --> 00:14:51.070\nJust understand, you can go grab the\nfolder that contains scanstate loadstate.\n\n255\n00:14:51.070 --> 00:14:54.860\nJust grab that folder and copy it to the\nroot of C and rename it something easy, so\n\n256\n00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:57.530\nyou don't have to type out\nthat entire path every time.\n\n257\n00:14:57.530 --> 00:14:58.238\n&gt;&gt; Good idea, Mike.\n\n258\n00:14:58.238 --> 00:15:00.051\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If this is something you're gonna be\n\n259\n00:15:00.051 --> 00:15:00.611\ndoing a lot of.\n\n260\n00:15:00.611 --> 00:15:04.036\nAll right, so\nI'm going to launch PowerShell,\n\n261\n00:15:04.036 --> 00:15:08.810\nI do need PowerShell as an admin,\nI'll run that as administrator.\n\n262\n00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:15.850\nAnd if we look just to verify,\nif I go to C:users,\n\n263\n00:15:15.850 --> 00:15:20.430\nyou'll see there's no\nTanisha on this machine.\n\n264\n00:15:20.430 --> 00:15:22.610\nOops, that's my zoom goes crazy.\n\n265\n00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:23.520\nNo Tanisha currently, right.\n\n266\n00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:32.166\nSo we will adjust my profile so that you\nguys can see what we're typing here.\n\n267\n00:15:35.412 --> 00:15:36.730\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\n\n268\n00:15:36.730 --> 00:15:38.990\n&gt;&gt; Make it a little bit easier.\n\n269\n00:15:38.990 --> 00:15:42.261\nAnd it makes it easier for\nme to see as well, so.\n\n270\n00:15:42.261 --> 00:15:45.996\n[LAUGH] All right, there we go.\n\n271\n00:15:45.996 --> 00:15:51.736\nAll right, so I'm gonna change over\nto what did I call, that USMT?\n\n272\n00:15:58.744 --> 00:16:02.877\nWell, it helps if you remember what\nyou called the folder that you copied\n\n273\n00:16:02.877 --> 00:16:04.107\neverything over to.\n\n274\n00:16:04.107 --> 00:16:06.158\nC:USMT, very good.\n\n275\n00:16:08.462 --> 00:16:13.570\nThere we go, and\nin here I should see my amd64 folder.\n\n276\n00:16:13.570 --> 00:16:14.239\nWe'll change over to that.\n\n277\n00:16:17.070 --> 00:16:18.780\nCannot type today, and there we go.\n\n278\n00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:22.111\nSo something again that\nyou gotta point out,\n\n279\n00:16:22.111 --> 00:16:27.120\nyou've got to install the USMT\ntools on your destination machine.\n\n280\n00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:32.610\nSo now I'm in that directory, and\nload state is the command we're gonna run.\n\n281\n00:16:32.610 --> 00:16:37.311\nJust like we ran scan state to gather up\nthe information, now on the destination\n\n282\n00:16:37.311 --> 00:16:41.800\nmachine I'm running load state to\npull that information back down.\n\n283\n00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:48.312\nSo it's gonna be load state, and then\nthe location of that big store, right?\n\n284\n00:16:48.312 --> 00:16:55.312\nWhere we stored all that data\nwhich was DC03/USMT, all right?\n\n285\n00:16:55.312 --> 00:16:59.640\nSure that's gonna connect, there we go.\n\n286\n00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:02.720\nAnd then I've got to tell it\nwhat instructions I used.\n\n287\n00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:08.521\nInclude files, we used migapp.xml,\n\n288\n00:17:08.521 --> 00:17:13.796\nwe did a switchi:miguser.xml and\n\n289\n00:17:13.796 --> 00:17:17.310\nwe did a switchi colon,\n\n290\n00:17:17.310 --> 00:17:23.310\nwhat was the other one we did, migdocs,\n\n291\n00:17:28.332 --> 00:17:31.989\nMigdocs.xml.\n\n292\n00:17:31.989 --> 00:17:34.224\nAnd in this case I could, kinda depends.\n\n293\n00:17:34.224 --> 00:17:39.620\nIf I had, let's say we had gathered up\nall the profiles off of one machine,\n\n294\n00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:44.589\nI was only pulling Aubrey's, or\nin this case Tanisha's settings,\n\n295\n00:17:44.589 --> 00:17:46.575\nback down to this machine.\n\n296\n00:17:46.575 --> 00:17:52.000\nI would wanna do a switch ue because the\ndata, the store includes lots of profiles.\n\n297\n00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.484\nSo I'm gonna say exclude all of them and\njust grab the one, and\n\n298\n00:17:55.484 --> 00:17:57.370\npull that one back down, right?\n\n299\n00:17:57.370 --> 00:18:03.604\nSo I do a colon asterisk\nslash asterisk oops,\n\n300\n00:18:03.604 --> 00:18:12.310\nslash asterisk in a switch UI\ncolon lab slash Tanisha, right?\n\n301\n00:18:12.310 --> 00:18:15.860\nNow in my case it only contains Tanisha so\nI really don't need to do that, but\n\n302\n00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:18.640\nI just wanna show you in case\nyou were you were working with.\n\n303\n00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:23.316\nAnd this is something we see, you're going\nfrom a small shared computer environment,\n\n304\n00:18:23.316 --> 00:18:27.550\ngrab everybody's profile in one file,\nand then breaking it up into multiple as\n\n305\n00:18:27.550 --> 00:18:29.970\neverybody gets to decide\ntheir own laptops.\n\n306\n00:18:29.970 --> 00:18:31.380\nSo I'll run that.\n\n307\n00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:37.310\nAnd of course I forgot, PowerShell does\nnot like to automatically include those.\n\n308\n00:18:37.310 --> 00:18:42.510\nSo we'll put a dot backslash,\nmake sure it runs that.\n\n309\n00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:46.965\nAnd there we go.\nAll right, so again we'll let this run for\n\n310\n00:18:46.965 --> 00:18:53.580\na minute as it cycles through that, and as\nsoon as it finishes we'll come right back.\n\n311\n00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:56.540\nAll right, now that command completed,\nif I can speak English, here we go.\n\n312\n00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:59.140\nWe'll take a look, zoom in here.\n\n313\n00:19:01.230 --> 00:19:04.835\nSo I found that profile,\napplied that data, 100% again,\n\n314\n00:19:04.835 --> 00:19:08.371\nI'm looking really for\nthat right there, return code zero,\n\n315\n00:19:08.371 --> 00:19:11.449\nletting me know that everything\nworked as it should.\n\n316\n00:19:11.449 --> 00:19:18.090\nI can cheat if I go take a look\nat File &gt; Explore &gt; C: &gt; Users.\n\n317\n00:19:18.090 --> 00:19:19.876\nI can see a folder for Tanisha's so\nthat's a good sign, right?\n\n318\n00:19:19.876 --> 00:19:24.256\nThat's telling me that that wasn't there\nbefore I ran and it's there now, so\n\n319\n00:19:24.256 --> 00:19:26.870\nit definitely was creating that profile.\n\n320\n00:19:26.870 --> 00:19:30.565\nSo let's log off and\nsee if we can log on as Tanisha.\n\n321\n00:19:30.565 --> 00:19:32.311\nSo we'll sign out.\n\n322\n00:19:32.311 --> 00:19:36.149\nRemember, you had to run\nthis as an administrator and\n\n323\n00:19:36.149 --> 00:19:38.120\nrun load state as an admin.\n\n324\n00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:43.680\nSo now Tanisha and\nher super secret password.\n\n325\n00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:52.417\nAnd we keep our fingers crossed, and\nwe're gonna go through this whole process,\n\n326\n00:19:52.417 --> 00:19:57.271\nbut it shouldn't take nearly as long\nas it normally does because really,\n\n327\n00:19:57.271 --> 00:19:59.750\nthe profile's already built.\n\n328\n00:19:59.750 --> 00:20:04.084\nIt does have to reach out and talk to\nthe Microsoft Store as building a new\n\n329\n00:20:04.084 --> 00:20:06.840\nprofile and gathering up that information.\n\n330\n00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:11.224\nAll those trials and fun little programs\nthat they want you to try out and\n\n331\n00:20:11.224 --> 00:20:12.065\nadvertise.\n\n332\n00:20:12.065 --> 00:20:14.533\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; As long as we can get it all sorted\n\n333\n00:20:14.533 --> 00:20:18.170\nbefore updates kick in,\nI think we'll be okay.\n\n334\n00:20:18.170 --> 00:20:21.980\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH] So, we'll see how it goes here.\n\n335\n00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:23.579\nYeah, this is a tool that's evolved.\n\n336\n00:20:23.579 --> 00:20:28.403\nWhen Windows 10 first came out, the USMT\nwas a little difficult to work with,\n\n337\n00:20:28.403 --> 00:20:30.420\nbecause Windows 10 was so new.\n\n338\n00:20:30.420 --> 00:20:33.210\nAnd the way it handled things was\nslightly different from Windows 8,\n\n339\n00:20:33.210 --> 00:20:36.390\nwhich was different from Windows 7,\nwhich was way different from Windows XP.\n\n340\n00:20:36.390 --> 00:20:43.000\nSo there were definitely some issues,\nespecially with the Microsoft Store apps.\n\n341\n00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:47.298\nThey gave some serious problems, but they\nseem to have fixed things over the last\n\n342\n00:20:47.298 --> 00:20:50.470\nfew versions of Windows 10\nthey've fixed those things.\n\n343\n00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:55.400\nSo it should be working well, and\nsure enough, does that look familiar?\n\n344\n00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:56.190\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n345\n00:20:56.190 --> 00:20:57.380\n&gt;&gt; It looks like I wanna\nbe there right now.\n\n346\n00:20:57.380 --> 00:21:01.550\n&gt;&gt; I know wouldn't that be nice, but\nthere's Tanisha's background, right?\n\n347\n00:21:01.550 --> 00:21:07.478\nSo all ready as a user, you've been handed\nthis new laptop and you're thinking gosh,\n\n348\n00:21:07.478 --> 00:21:11.760\nhere we go, I am gonna be all day\njust trying to get ready to work.\n\n349\n00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:15.790\nThey hand you your laptop,\nyou log in for the first time and bam!\n\n350\n00:21:15.790 --> 00:21:17.536\nThere is your background that\nyou had on your old machine.\n\n351\n00:21:17.536 --> 00:21:19.640\nYou are already feeling better.\n\n352\n00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:24.740\nLook, there is a the file that\nI created on her old desktop,\n\n353\n00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:27.430\nall the data still there.\n\n354\n00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:32.023\nIf we were to take a look at\nFile Explorer and we look in Documents,\n\n355\n00:21:32.023 --> 00:21:35.460\nthere's her files that\nwere on her old machine.\n\n356\n00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:39.790\nPictures, there's the kittens picture,\nand the other pictures she had.\n\n357\n00:21:39.790 --> 00:21:42.570\nSo all of that is already there.\n\n358\n00:21:42.570 --> 00:21:47.770\nVideos, Lucid did get the video even\nthough I told it not to get the video.\n\n359\n00:21:47.770 --> 00:21:50.570\nSo this is a common issue\nthat you'll run into,\n\n360\n00:21:50.570 --> 00:21:55.305\nthis is why working with the USFD\nsometimes take a little bit of tweaking.\n\n361\n00:21:55.305 --> 00:22:00.102\nBecause while I said no in that one config\nfile there's probably a rule in one of\n\n362\n00:22:00.102 --> 00:22:04.990\nthose other config files that's saying\nget all AVIs, or something like that.\n\n363\n00:22:04.990 --> 00:22:09.810\nSo for some reason this file\nwas copied over anyways.\n\n364\n00:22:09.810 --> 00:22:10.820\nThis is something you'll see with USMT.\n\n365\n00:22:10.820 --> 00:22:14.836\nThere's a lot of config files, and\nyou have to try to figure out which\n\n366\n00:22:14.836 --> 00:22:19.128\nconfig file is causing this file to be\ncopied and you didn't want it to, or\n\n367\n00:22:19.128 --> 00:22:23.245\nwhich file is not copying the file\neven though you told it to.\n\n368\n00:22:23.245 --> 00:22:26.665\nThere's a little bit of tweaking\nin that process, but all in all,\n\n369\n00:22:26.665 --> 00:22:28.200\nall of our settings are here.\n\n370\n00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:33.419\nIf I open up File C, let's check Edge,\nand see if our Favorites came in,\n\n371\n00:22:33.419 --> 00:22:38.400\nand I can already see we're having\nproblems with the false for html.\n\n372\n00:22:39.970 --> 00:22:46.141\nIf I go to my Favorites, I've\n\n373\n00:22:46.141 --> 00:22:51.300\ngot no Favorites, so my Favorites did\nnot come in with all of those settings.\n\n374\n00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:53.265\nBut other stuff did.\n\n375\n00:22:53.265 --> 00:22:55.740\nWe know Favorites are pretty\neasy one to explore.\n\n376\n00:22:55.740 --> 00:22:56.850\nWe can start scripting that as well.\n\n377\n00:22:56.850 --> 00:23:01.451\nBut for the exam and for what we need\nto know about USMT, you got to see that\n\n378\n00:23:01.451 --> 00:23:06.660\nentire process of moving somebody's\nprofile from one machine to another.\n\n379\n00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:11.020\nScan state was the part that loaded it up,\nLoad state was what put it back.\n\n380\n00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:15.748\nWe saw the different config files that we\ncan use to control what it is that gets\n\n381\n00:23:15.748 --> 00:23:16.270\nmoved.\n\n382\n00:23:16.270 --> 00:23:20.064\nWe also saw some of the different\nswitches we can use with scan state and\n\n383\n00:23:20.064 --> 00:23:23.473\nload state to control what profiles\nare scanned or stored, and\n\n384\n00:23:23.473 --> 00:23:25.360\nthen what profiles are returned.\n\n385\n00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:28.004\n&gt;&gt;

Welcome everyone to your\n\n4\n00:00:13.183 --> 00:00:17.370\nConfiguring Windows Devices\nseries studying for thar 70-697.\n\n5\n00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:19.270\nI'm your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:22.790\nIn this episode, we'll be taking a look\nat well how to configure Hyper-V.\n\n7\n00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:25.714\nAnd with us today in the studios,\nwe have Mr. Mike Rodrick.\n\n8\n00:00:25.714 --> 00:00:28.430\nHow is it t going today Mike?\n&gt;&gt; It's going great I'm excited as always\n\n9\n00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:31.590\nbecause we're talking about Hyper-V.\n&gt;&gt; I know you like Hyper-V.\n\n10\n00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.417\n&gt;&gt; I do like some Hyper-V and today,\n\n11\n00:00:33.417 --> 00:00:36.260\nwe get to play with Hyper-V on Windows 10,\nright?\n\n12\n00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.197\nIt is part of the exam objectives, we need\nto understand it, be able to configure it,\n\n13\n00:00:40.197 --> 00:00:43.840\nwork with VMs, work with Hard Drives,\nwork with virtual switches.\n\n14\n00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.720\nPlus it's just a cool thing to have,\nright?\n\n15\n00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.860\nTo be virtualize on your\nclient Operating System\n\n16\n00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.740\nopens up a lot of possibilities, right?\n\n17\n00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:56.210\nWhen I need to set up a little test lab,\nI can run Hyper-V right there built-in\n\n18\n00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.940\nto Windows 10, we just have to\nturn it on so we can do that.\n\n19\n00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.310\nIf I'm in a dev environment and\nI need to develop Virtual Machines and\n\n20\n00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:08.040\nthen maybe move them to a production\nenvironment that's running Hyper-V.\n\n21\n00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.180\nBecause I'm using Hyper-V locally, those\nmachines will export and import just fine.\n\n22\n00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.360\nSo it really is a pretty\npowerful solution.\n\n23\n00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.690\n&gt;&gt; It's kind of cool when you think about\n\n24\n00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:18.680\nit and where things came from.\n\n25\n00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.217\nBecause that wasn't even an option years\nago, and now we have all sorts of cool\n\n26\n00:01:23.217 --> 00:01:26.085\nthings we can do with Hyper-V.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I remember,\n\n27\n00:01:26.085 --> 00:01:27.390\nI'll date myself.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n28\n00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.530\n&gt;&gt; But when I was first getting into this\n\n29\n00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.340\nI remember, trying to just salvage and\n\n30\n00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.310\nfind, hey, if you're throwing away\nthat machine, I can use it right?\n\n31\n00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.150\nGathering up old PCs of any kind,\nto try to build a test lab,\n\n32\n00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.960\nbecause you needed hardware to\ninstall that Operating System on,\n\n33\n00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.200\nback in Windows 2000s,\nthat is what I was playing with.\n\n34\n00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:50.500\nYou needed that hardware, and\nnowadays I can take my laptop, and\n\n35\n00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.970\nI can run a domain control, or\na file server, a couple of clients.\n\n36\n00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.020\nI can setup an entire\ninfrastructure right here and\n\n37\n00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.630\ncarry it around with me.\n&gt;&gt; And you won't have a living room full\n\n38\n00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.160\nof hardware?\n&gt;&gt; I know,\n\n39\n00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.197\nmy room was extremely hot.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n40\n00:02:03.197 --> 00:02:05.746\n&gt;&gt; My power bill was through the roof, and\n\n41\n00:02:05.746 --> 00:02:07.800\nit was just a mismatch of junk.\n\n42\n00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.720\nSo definitely love virtualization,\nand it's not new.\n\n43\n00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.060\nI mean, we talk about it.\n\n44\n00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.480\nIt's been around for a long time.\n\n45\n00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:14.670\nIt's come a long ways.\n\n46\n00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.830\nHyper-V on Windows is\nnot new to Windows 10.\n\n47\n00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.730\nBut it is nice that it's built-in, right?\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n48\n00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.110\n&gt;&gt; It's an optional feature that\n\n49\n00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.310\nwe can now just enable, so it's fantastic.\n\n50\n00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.810\nAll right.\n\n51\n00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.150\nSo, where the heck do we start?\n\n52\n00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.497\nLet's talk about-, one, let's just make\nsure everybody's on the same page as far\n\n53\n00:02:30.497 --> 00:02:32.265\nas what Hyper-V is, right?\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n54\n00:02:32.265 --> 00:02:34.810\n&gt;&gt; Hyper-V is a type one hypervisor,\n\n55\n00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:40.700\nmeaning that it sits in between my\nhardware and my host operating system.\n\n56\n00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.870\nAnd let's setup some terms, so that we can\ntalk about this intelligently, as well.\n\n57\n00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.750\nWhen we talk about a host, that's the\nphysical usually, the physical machine,\n\n58\n00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.970\nthe one that's gonna be\nrunning the Hyper-V,\n\n59\n00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.370\nHypervisor that's going to host\nother virtual machines right?\n\n60\n00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.168\nSo your host machine is the one\nthat you're installing Hyper-V on.\n\n61\n00:03:00.168 --> 00:03:01.884\n[COUGH] Excuse me.\n\n62\n00:03:01.884 --> 00:03:07.380\nAnd so Hyper-V allows me to,\nHyper-V is a type one hypervisor\n\n63\n00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:13.980\nthat sits in between my hardware and\nmy installed operating system on my host.\n\n64\n00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:19.020\nUnlike our type twos, if you go back\nto like virtual PC from Microsoft, or\n\n65\n00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:21.400\nVirtualbox, still a great one out there.\n\n66\n00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.680\nOracle I think puts that out Virtual box.\n\n67\n00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.410\nThese are type two Hypervisors, and\nthey run like an application, right?\n\n68\n00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:29.790\nYou install it just like\nyou would install Office.\n\n69\n00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:34.680\nYou download VirtualBox, you install it,\nit's an application that you\n\n70\n00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.020\nrun on top of your operating system,\nyou create virtual machines in there.\n\n71\n00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:41.900\nBut it doesn't have the direct\naccess to the hardware, right?\n\n72\n00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:46.600\nIt's going through VirtualBox to my\noperating system to the hardware.\n\n73\n00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:50.620\nWhereas with Type 1s, you're slipping this\nHypervisor in between your hardware and\n\n74\n00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.180\nyour actual Operating System, so\nyou get much better performance.\n\n75\n00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:58.820\nWith two types and Virtualbox,\nif you close your Window to the VM\n\n76\n00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:01.157\nyou're closing that virtual machine,\nit's no longer running.\n\n77\n00:04:01.157 --> 00:04:04.690\nWith Type 1s,\nif you close your window to that VM.\n\n78\n00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:06.605\nLet's say you remoted into\none of your virtual machines,\n\n79\n00:04:06.605 --> 00:04:08.810\nthe virtual machine's still\nrunning in the background, right?\n\n80\n00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:11.280\nThey're running almost like\na service if you will,\n\n81\n00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:15.465\nwhich is what we need in\nour production environment.\n\n82\n00:04:15.465 --> 00:04:17.625\nSo a little difference there,\nbut that's what Hyper-V is.\n\n83\n00:04:17.625 --> 00:04:20.255\nIt's Microsoft's\nvirtualization solution for\n\n84\n00:04:20.255 --> 00:04:23.475\nType 1 Hypervisor.\n&gt;&gt; So Mike, looking at these different\n\n85\n00:04:23.475 --> 00:04:28.355\nlevels of obstruction layers and\nseeing which option would be best for me?\n\n86\n00:04:28.355 --> 00:04:33.215\nSo if I wanted to play around and that you\nwould suggest going maybe with a Type 2,\n\n87\n00:04:33.215 --> 00:04:35.885\nif I wasn't able to have a Type 1 or\nlike in a production environment?\n\n88\n00:04:35.885 --> 00:04:38.190\nWhere do we see these\nreally being utilized?\n\n89\n00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:39.991\n&gt;&gt; Well, that's the cool thing about\n\n90\n00:04:39.991 --> 00:04:42.160\nhaving Hyper-V built into Windows 10.\n\n91\n00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:46.613\nIf you're just playing around a little\nbit, let's say you needed a Linux box,\n\n92\n00:04:46.613 --> 00:04:51.203\nor an older version of Windows, or you\njust wanted another version of Windows 10\n\n93\n00:04:51.203 --> 00:04:54.780\nthat you could bang on and\nnot mess up your host PC.\n\n94\n00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:59.310\nThen, a virtual box or something like\nthat might be fine, using it Type 2.\n\n95\n00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:03.044\nOne for this exam and two, if you're\ngonna be doing this for a living,\n\n96\n00:05:03.044 --> 00:05:05.768\nif you're gonna be working\nwith virtualization,\n\n97\n00:05:05.768 --> 00:05:09.970\nyou need to start playing around with\nHyper-V or with the Type 1 Hypervisor.\n\n98\n00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:12.030\nCuz this is what you're gonna\nuse in a production environment.\n\n99\n00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:15.560\nYou will not find Type 2s In\na production environment.\n\n100\n00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:18.840\nMaybe on a developer's computer like\nI said just to spin up an extra box\n\n101\n00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:19.730\nhere or there.\n\n102\n00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:25.350\nBut we just dont' get the performance that\nwe would need to host a DNS server or\n\n103\n00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:28.648\na web server or\nanything like that out of those Type 2s.\n\n104\n00:05:28.648 --> 00:05:32.461\nSo Type 1, if you're gonna do this,\nif you're gonna study for the exam,\n\n105\n00:05:32.461 --> 00:05:35.851\nyou're gonna be working with\nvirtualization as part of your job,\n\n106\n00:05:35.851 --> 00:05:37.920\nit's built into Windows, it's free.\n\n107\n00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:39.340\nYou can go ahead and install it.\n\n108\n00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:41.740\nIn fact,\nyou can get trial versions of software,\n\n109\n00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:42.805\nso you don't have to pay for that, right?\n\n110\n00:05:42.805 --> 00:05:43.937\nYou can get a trial version-\n&gt;&gt; For free.\n\n111\n00:05:43.937 --> 00:05:44.751\n&gt;&gt; Of Windows 10.\n\n112\n00:05:44.751 --> 00:05:45.282\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n113\n00:05:45.282 --> 00:05:47.090\n&gt;&gt; We love free, don't we?\n\n114\n00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:48.702\nThat is our favorite price.\n\n115\n00:05:48.702 --> 00:05:52.153\nAll right, so\nwe got an idea of what Hyper-V is,\n\n116\n00:05:52.153 --> 00:05:55.040\nthat's Microsoft Type 1 Hypervisor.\n\n117\n00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:58.590\nLet's talk about requirements for\nthat, this is a Windows 10 class,\n\n118\n00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:01.620\nso that's where we'll focus on, but\nlet's take a look at my screen here.\n\n119\n00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:06.390\nI'm just out on Technet,\nI'll put these links in the show notes,\n\n120\n00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:09.390\ntalking about introduction\nto Hyper-V on Windows 10.\n\n121\n00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:11.470\nThose are replaces Microsoft virtual PCs,\n\n122\n00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:14.370\nthey don't even offer\ntheir Type 2 anymore.\n\n123\n00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:18.360\nThey're like hey look, we'll build in\nHyper-V into your operating system and\n\n124\n00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:20.590\nyou can just use that, all right.\n\n125\n00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:23.840\nReally, it's a great read, so\ntake your time and go through this page.\n\n126\n00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:26.679\nWhat I wanted to show you was\nsome of the requirements,\n\n127\n00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:32.650\nactually let's start with some of\nthe limitations and differences.\n\n128\n00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:37.160\nBecause there are some differences between\nHyper-V that you're gonna put on your 2016\n\n129\n00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:40.130\nserver and\nHyper-V that you would run in Windows 10.\n\n130\n00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:42.784\nVery few and\nnot enough to make them incompatible but\n\n131\n00:06:42.784 --> 00:06:45.930\nthere are some differences we\nshould be aware of, all right?\n\n132\n00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:48.390\nAnd they talk about them right here.\n\n133\n00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:52.460\nVirtualizing GPUs,\nwe're using remote FX, all right.\n\n134\n00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:56.998\nThis is, if I'm running a VDI,\nvirtual desktop infrastructure, and\n\n135\n00:06:56.998 --> 00:07:00.410\nI wanna provide high level graphics for\nmy end users.\n\n136\n00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:05.660\nAnd their virtual Windows 10 Desktop, I\nwould virtualize GPUs on my Hyper-V host.\n\n137\n00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:07.080\nCan't do that on Windows 10.\n\n138\n00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:10.370\nYou can do live migrations\non virtual machines.\n\n139\n00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:12.140\nYou can't run a Hyper V replica so\n\n140\n00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:15.500\nyou're not gonna be able to use your\nWindows 10 box as a replica for\n\n141\n00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:18.718\nyour Hyper V production servers or\nanything like that, [COUGH].\n\n142\n00:07:18.718 --> 00:07:21.680\nIt doesn't support virtual fiber channel,\n\n143\n00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:26.440\nSRIOV networking where we deal with\nbypassing the host machine and\n\n144\n00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:30.210\ngoing directly to the network adapter,\nor share VHDXs.\n\n145\n00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:32.080\nThese are relatively new thing.\n\n146\n00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:36.121\nThose are only gonna be available if\nyou're installing hyper VM on a server\n\n147\n00:07:36.121 --> 00:07:37.219\n2016 machine.\n\n148\n00:07:37.219 --> 00:07:39.140\nSo slight differences there.\n\n149\n00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:41.480\nBut other than that, it's the same thing.\n\n150\n00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:45.970\nSo like I said, I can create a VM and\nhyper VM on Windows 10 machine here.\n\n151\n00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:47.270\nI can export that.\n\n152\n00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:51.030\nI can turn around and import that\nright into my production environment.\n\n153\n00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:55.223\nAll right,\nlet's talk about the requirements for\n\n154\n00:07:55.223 --> 00:07:58.614\ngetting Windows Hyper-V\ninstalled on Windows 10 [COUGH].\n\n155\n00:07:58.614 --> 00:08:01.092\nWindows 10 is a requirement, yeah.\n\n156\n00:08:01.092 --> 00:08:02.655\nSurprise surprise, right.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n157\n00:08:02.655 --> 00:08:04.209\n&gt;&gt; It actually goes back further than\n\n158\n00:08:04.209 --> 00:08:05.396\nthat, you can go back to.\n\n159\n00:08:05.396 --> 00:08:09.605\nWindows 8.1 so not too much further back.\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n160\n00:08:09.605 --> 00:08:14.124\nyeah because that reminded me with\nServer 2012 was it with the R2 release\n\n161\n00:08:14.124 --> 00:08:18.643\nwhatever those two kinda came out together\nas a package when you first saw that\n\n162\n00:08:18.643 --> 00:08:22.420\ncapability to be able to have\nHyper-V on a client side machine.\n\n163\n00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:26.050\nAnd I thought that's crazy,\nnow you can like manage which is great for\n\n164\n00:08:26.050 --> 00:08:29.640\neven administration in some capacity.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n165\n00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:33.380\nabsolutely that brings up another great\npoint the fact that even if I don't\n\n166\n00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:38.620\nplan on running virtual machines or\njust a few on my laptop here, for example.\n\n167\n00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:42.780\nI can still install Hyper-V,\nget that Hyper-V Management Console,\n\n168\n00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:45.300\nand then point it to my\nproduction Hyper-V servers and\n\n169\n00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:48.200\nmanage those servers from my machine here,\nright?\n\n170\n00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:49.590\nSo it works out well.\n\n171\n00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:53.250\nSo we won't focus on the older\noperating systems though,\n\n172\n00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:57.610\nbut it's Windows 8.1 and\nlater has Hyper-V built into it.\n\n173\n00:08:57.610 --> 00:09:02.910\nIt also requires a 64-bit\noperating system and\n\n174\n00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:06.140\nit needs to be Enterprise,\nProfessional, or Education.\n\n175\n00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:08.810\nNotice they do include\nthe Education version.\n\n176\n00:09:08.810 --> 00:09:11.460\nCan't be home or any or\nthe mobile versions, so\n\n177\n00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:14.440\nit's not supported on those, right?\n\n178\n00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:19.110\nHardware requirements again,\nyou need a 64-bit processor, right?\n\n179\n00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:26.490\nI need those extra bits on my bus in\nthere, so we need a 64-bit processor.\n\n180\n00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:32.240\nAnd it also has to support something known\nas second level address translation,\n\n181\n00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:34.290\nor SLAT for short.\n\n182\n00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:38.560\nWe don't have to get into the technical\nside of that, it has to do with the way\n\n183\n00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:42.780\nit virtualizes memory and makes that\nmemory available to the virtual machines.\n\n184\n00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:46.130\nIt reduces a lot of\nthe overhead on the hypervisor,\n\n185\n00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:48.500\nthat gives you good performance basically.\n\n186\n00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:51.050\nAnd if you don't have SLAT support,\n\n187\n00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:53.650\nyou're not gonna be able\nto get Hyper-V installed.\n\n188\n00:09:53.650 --> 00:09:57.520\nYou need your CPU support for\n\n189\n00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:02.900\nVM Monitor mode extensions,\nminimum of 4 gigs of memory, all right?\n\n190\n00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:06.079\nAnd you also have to be\nenable virtualization,\n\n191\n00:10:06.079 --> 00:10:09.660\ntypically in your bios on\nyour Windows 10 machine.\n\n192\n00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:12.160\nYou go into the BIOS and\nyou turn that on, right?\n\n193\n00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:14.760\nSo these are your requirements,\nnot too steep.\n\n194\n00:10:15.810 --> 00:10:21.000\nNowadays for most of our systems it's hard\nto find the machine that's not 64-bits.\n\n195\n00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:26.010\nMost of your machines are going to\nsupport SLAT and virtualization.\n\n196\n00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:29.840\nIt's just a matter of making\nsure that I have those and\n\n197\n00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:32.794\nenabling them if I have to.\n&gt;&gt; Now,\n\n198\n00:10:32.794 --> 00:10:34.910\nthe 4 gigs of RAM is a requirement,\n\n199\n00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:37.881\nwhat do you think about that Mike?\n&gt;&gt; Well, we'll come back and\n\n200\n00:10:37.881 --> 00:10:40.173\ntalk about that, but that's bare minimum.\n\n201\n00:10:40.173 --> 00:10:42.061\nI mean you're not gonna-\n&gt;&gt; I know, I'm like all right,\n\n202\n00:10:42.061 --> 00:10:44.820\nwhat do you have to say about that?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you're not gonna get very far\n\n203\n00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:47.590\nwith 4 gigs, you are not gonna\nbe happy with the performance.\n\n204\n00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:50.910\nYou're just gonna get frustrated and\ngo, the heck with this.\n\n205\n00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:54.860\nSo don't plan on 4 gigabytes of memory.\n\n206\n00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:59.570\nAll right, now a couple of things we can\nuse to figure out if our machine is ready\n\n207\n00:10:59.570 --> 00:11:00.990\nfor virtualization.\n\n208\n00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:05.900\nOne way you can do it is you can go\nto msinfo32 or system information,\n\n209\n00:11:07.070 --> 00:11:11.350\nand on your system information\nscreen down towards the bottom here,\n\n210\n00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:13.205\nI see a little bit of info.\n\n211\n00:11:13.205 --> 00:11:17.520\nHyper-V, VM, and I've already\ngot Hyper-V installed on here.\n\n212\n00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:20.320\nI'm sorry, actually I have\na different Hypervisor installed,\n\n213\n00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:23.265\nbut I can see that it does support, right?\n\n214\n00:11:23.265 --> 00:11:27.150\nHyper-V, second level, address,\ntranslations, extensions Yes.\n\n215\n00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:29.280\nVirtualization is turned\non in my firmware,\n\n216\n00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:32.830\nmy BIOS, yes or UEFI I guess in this case.\n\n217\n00:11:32.830 --> 00:11:34.680\nDo I support data execution prevention?\n\n218\n00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:37.420\nYes, so\nI can get some of that information here.\n\n219\n00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:43.220\nAnd couple other tools I actually was\nplaying around with the other day,\n\n220\n00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:46.830\njust to see, cuz the info is available,\nyou can fire up your BIOS.\n\n221\n00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:50.720\nAnd you can go through your settings and\nyou can look at whether or\n\n222\n00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:53.680\nnot virtualization is in there and\nyou can turn it on.\n\n223\n00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:57.220\nBut I did find a couple of cool\nlittle tools you could use,\n\n224\n00:11:57.220 --> 00:11:59.490\nif you didn't wanna go that route.\n\n225\n00:11:59.490 --> 00:12:03.869\nOne of them is this Coreinfo,\n\n226\n00:12:03.869 --> 00:12:09.832\nlet me see if I can go to PowerShell here.\n\n227\n00:12:11.090 --> 00:12:16.600\nI might need to run this as an admin,\nnope all right there we go.\n\n228\n00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:20.000\nSo this coreinfo basically\nit's from Sysinternals.\n\n229\n00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.900\nYou can see here\nMark Russinovich Sysinternals,\n\n230\n00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:27.990\nit's free download and this is just\ndumping information about my processor.\n\n231\n00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:31.850\nI can see all of the information,\nI can see hyper-threading is enabled,\n\n232\n00:12:31.850 --> 00:12:34.210\nI can see hypervisor is present.\n\n233\n00:12:34.210 --> 00:12:39.366\nThere's also another switch you can run\nwith this which is a -v to get just\n\n234\n00:12:39.366 --> 00:12:44.359\nvirtualization information and\nI do need an administrative prompt for\n\n235\n00:12:44.359 --> 00:12:45.513\nthat.\n&gt;&gt; Well that's pretty cool.\n\n236\n00:12:45.513 --> 00:12:46.760\nI mean-\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n\n237\n00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:48.450\n&gt;&gt; You're able to get a lot information\n\n238\n00:12:48.450 --> 00:12:50.540\nquickly that way.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.\n\n239\n00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:54.490\nAnd let me run PowerShell real\nquick as an administrator.\n\n240\n00:12:54.490 --> 00:12:56.610\nProbably just pull up\nmy command prompt and\n\n241\n00:12:56.610 --> 00:13:01.330\nwe'll do it that way,\neither way would work and that's fine.\n\n242\n00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:05.080\nI'll zoom in here in just a second, let\nme navigate over to the right location.\n\n243\n00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:11.242\nLet's go to D: and we'll change into,\n\n244\n00:13:11.242 --> 00:13:14.563\nwhere did I dump that guy?\n\n245\n00:13:14.563 --> 00:13:18.125\nVM share/coreinfo and\n\n246\n00:13:18.125 --> 00:13:23.470\nthen I'll run core info from here.\n\n247\n00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:28.764\nAnd I'm gonna add a switch v to it\nthis time, so let me zoom in and\n\n248\n00:13:28.764 --> 00:13:30.498\nshow you what I'm doing here.\n\n249\n00:13:30.498 --> 00:13:36.843\nSo I'm gonna do coreinfo.exe -v and\nhere I can see just that virtualization\n\n250\n00:13:36.843 --> 00:13:41.730\ncuz sometimes it's hard to find the info.\n&gt;&gt; Differentiate between your local\n\n251\n00:13:41.730 --> 00:13:44.370\nmachine.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, when it's packed in there really,\n\n252\n00:13:44.370 --> 00:13:47.170\nthere's a lot of info getting\ndumped about that processor.\n\n253\n00:13:47.170 --> 00:13:51.310\nLet me zoom back out, that really\nplayed havoc with my icons down there.\n\n254\n00:13:51.310 --> 00:13:54.170\nBut again,\nit's a free tool that you can download.\n\n255\n00:13:54.170 --> 00:13:56.130\nNot part of the exam,\nyou don't have to worry about it.\n\n256\n00:13:56.130 --> 00:13:57.700\nI just thought I just throw that in there.\n\n257\n00:13:57.700 --> 00:14:02.290\nYour personal benefit, he, I wanna run\nHyper-V on my laptop do I support it,\n\n258\n00:14:02.290 --> 00:14:04.150\nhow can I find that information out?\n\n259\n00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:09.470\nMsinfo is the way to go for\nbuilt in solutions, Core Info\n\n260\n00:14:09.470 --> 00:14:14.840\nis a free download from Microsoft,\nI'll put the link in the show notes.\n\n261\n00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:19.270\nAnother one you can do is Intel has\na processor identification utility\n\n262\n00:14:19.270 --> 00:14:20.800\nthat you can run.\n\n263\n00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:23.660\nAnd this will dump information\nagain about your process, or\n\n264\n00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:26.220\nmaybe you are not exactly sure\nwhat process was in there.\n\n265\n00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:29.190\nIt's a hame down,\na laptop you got assigned.\n\n266\n00:14:29.190 --> 00:14:32.340\nYou can find out if that\nsupports virtualization.\n\n267\n00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:34.530\nSo you can just come here and download it.\n\n268\n00:14:34.530 --> 00:14:37.744\nI won't write it again, it's a third party\ntool that's not part of the exam but\n\n269\n00:14:37.744 --> 00:14:39.560\nI thought you guys might find that useful.\n\n270\n00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:44.580\nSo take a look at those two\ntools if you would like.\n\n271\n00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:47.990\nAll right, so Cherokee, we talk\nabout those system requirements, and\n\n272\n00:14:47.990 --> 00:14:50.730\nyou brought up memory, and\nthat's a great one to start with.\n\n273\n00:14:50.730 --> 00:14:52.220\nWhen we talk about virtualization,\n\n274\n00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:56.610\nwhat we've gotta remember is that we\nare now going to divide up all my\n\n275\n00:14:56.610 --> 00:15:01.210\navailable resources amongst the virtual\nmachines that I'm gonna create.\n\n276\n00:15:01.210 --> 00:15:03.260\nAnd I can't forget about my host, right?\n\n277\n00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:08.550\nFor example, my laptop here is\nusing CPU cycles, it's using RAM.\n\n278\n00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:12.240\nI have so much CPU available,\nI have so much RAM available.\n\n279\n00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:16.460\nI also have hard drive space that I need\nto worry about and hard drive performance.\n\n280\n00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:19.950\nNow I'm gonna start creating virtual\nmachines, I'm gonna take and\n\n281\n00:15:19.950 --> 00:15:26.660\ncreate an install of Server 2016 or\ntwo installs of 2016, and a client.\n\n282\n00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:29.990\nWell, each one of those\nalso needs CPU cycles,\n\n283\n00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:33.270\naccess to RAM, hard drive space, right?\n\n284\n00:15:33.270 --> 00:15:37.250\nSo what I've gotta do is take those\nresources that are available in my laptop,\n\n285\n00:15:37.250 --> 00:15:38.520\nand now divvy them up.\n\n286\n00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:43.030\nAnd say okay, I'm gonna give this virtual\nmachine a little slice of processor, and\n\n287\n00:15:43.030 --> 00:15:44.520\na little slice of memory.\n\n288\n00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:47.799\nAnd I'm gonna do the same thing for\nthose other virtual machines and\n\n289\n00:15:47.799 --> 00:15:51.018\nI can't forget that I still need\nto run the host operating system,\n\n290\n00:15:51.018 --> 00:15:53.223\nthe hypervisor itself requires resources.\n\n291\n00:15:53.223 --> 00:15:56.790\nSo when you think about creating virtual\nmachines, and when you think about\n\n292\n00:15:56.790 --> 00:16:00.648\nwhat your minimum requirements are for\nyour system, you gotta think about that.\n\n293\n00:16:00.648 --> 00:16:04.975\nAll right, my host OS needs 4 gigs\nof memory, if I install Server 2016,\n\n294\n00:16:04.975 --> 00:16:07.250\nI probably want about 4 gigs of memory.\n\n295\n00:16:07.250 --> 00:16:12.860\nI do two Server 2016's, those are another\n8 gigs and up to 16 gigs already.\n\n296\n00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:16.060\nAnd so you can see it starts\nadding up pretty quickly,\n\n297\n00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:19.360\nso you really have to think about that.\n&gt;&gt; I know, and the struggle is real.\n\n298\n00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:25.270\nI deal with this almost on a daily basis\njust how can I push this in flow, but it's\n\n299\n00:16:25.270 --> 00:16:29.945\nvery important because times you'll lock\nthings up get frustrated, and just, yeah.\n\n300\n00:16:29.945 --> 00:16:30.990\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.\n\n301\n00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:31.900\n&gt;&gt; Listen to Mike.\n\n302\n00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:32.660\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely,\n\n303\n00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:35.900\nit will, that's why you go out and\nyou buy.\n\n304\n00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:37.530\nWell, work buys my system.\n\n305\n00:16:37.530 --> 00:16:41.770\nI say, hey, give me 32 gigs of RAM, give\nme a couple of hard drives in there, and\n\n306\n00:16:41.770 --> 00:16:44.260\ngive me a really nice processor,\n[FOREIGN].\n\n307\n00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:47.330\nAnd they do,\nbecause ITPRO.TV is fantastic.\n\n308\n00:16:47.330 --> 00:16:49.860\nAnd that's what allows me to run, three or\n\n309\n00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:53.090\nfour, five virtual\nmachines at the same time.\n\n310\n00:16:53.090 --> 00:16:56.990\nI still run into some disk IO issues,\nbut as far as memory and\n\n311\n00:16:56.990 --> 00:16:59.280\nprocessor goes I'm good to go.\n\n312\n00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:02.020\nBut when we're talking about requirements,\nwhat are the requirements?\n\n313\n00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:04.230\nWell, it depends on what you're gonna do.\n\n314\n00:17:04.230 --> 00:17:09.000\nIf you're just gonna spin up one\nWindows 10 VM to do some testing in,\n\n315\n00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.680\nthen you don't need that much more\nthan what you've already got, right?\n\n316\n00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:14.840\nThat Windows 10 VM could get by on two or\n\n317\n00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:17.790\nthree gigabytes maybe it\nwould really like four.\n\n318\n00:17:17.790 --> 00:17:22.830\nBut if you plan on spinning up an entire\ntest lab, a domain controller,\n\n319\n00:17:22.830 --> 00:17:26.050\na server and two clients or\nsomething like that.\n\n320\n00:17:26.050 --> 00:17:29.510\nWell, now you're gonna need a lot more\nthan 4 gigabytes of total system memory,\n\n321\n00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:32.300\ncuz you're gonna need to divide\nthose resources up amongst all\n\n322\n00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:33.160\nthose virtual machines.\n\n323\n00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:35.330\nSo there's not really a hard,\n\n324\n00:17:35.330 --> 00:17:38.520\nfast requirement,\nMicrosoft will throw out their minimum.\n\n325\n00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:42.600\nBut that's why you were chuckling\nwhen they said 4 gigabytes minimum.\n\n326\n00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:43.610\nWhat are you gonna do with that?\n\n327\n00:17:43.610 --> 00:17:45.640\nYour host eats that up already.\n\n328\n00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:48.570\nHow you gonna even create\nyour first virtual machine?\n\n329\n00:17:48.570 --> 00:17:51.260\nAnd it can be painfully slow if\nyou don't have a lot of memory and\n\n330\n00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:53.660\nyou trying to install operating system.\n\n331\n00:17:53.660 --> 00:17:56.970\nSo, just be ready for\nthat if you don't have enough.\n\n332\n00:17:56.970 --> 00:18:00.460\nAll right, let's see what else,\nso, next thing we need to do,\n\n333\n00:18:00.460 --> 00:18:02.990\nwe need to get Hyper-V installed.\n\n334\n00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:03.960\nIt'll be our first step.\n\n335\n00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:08.226\nWe've we've made sure that we're running\nan operating system that supports Hyper-V,\n\n336\n00:18:08.226 --> 00:18:12.100\ngot Windows 10 Enterprise it's the trial\nversion I'm working with here.\n\n337\n00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:16.960\nSo we're good to go there,\nI've got plenty of RAM, 32 gigs of RAM.\n\n338\n00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:21.130\nI've got plenty of processor,\nI've got my Hyper-V or\n\n339\n00:18:21.130 --> 00:18:23.830\nmy virtualization enabled in my BIOS.\n\n340\n00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:29.750\nAnd I know that my system is 64-bit,\nso I meet all the requirements.\n\n341\n00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:32.430\nNext thing I wanna do is I wanna turn\non Hyper-V, let's get in there and\n\n342\n00:18:32.430 --> 00:18:34.740\nplay with it, right?\n&gt;&gt; Right, so what we gonna to do, Mike?\n\n343\n00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:35.530\n&gt;&gt; Yeah how do we do that?\n\n344\n00:18:35.530 --> 00:18:38.560\nA couple of different ways, I actually\nalready have it installed cuz I didn't\n\n345\n00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:41.930\nwant you guys to watch the install\nprocess, it's no that exciting,\n\n346\n00:18:41.930 --> 00:18:45.770\nbut I'll talk about it and\nshow you how you get it installed.\n\n347\n00:18:45.770 --> 00:18:49.850\nFrom the GUI interface, we can do turn on,\n\n348\n00:18:49.850 --> 00:18:54.340\nlet's see, Windows features on or\noff, right?\n\n349\n00:18:54.340 --> 00:18:59.093\nAnd be careful with this one,\nit is the turn Windows Features,\n\n350\n00:18:59.093 --> 00:19:01.253\nif I can say that, on or off.\n\n351\n00:19:01.253 --> 00:19:07.080\nIt's real tempting to go here and\ngo Apps and Features, right?\n\n352\n00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:10.930\nAnd you get to this screen and\nyou're looking for Hyper-V and\n\n353\n00:19:10.930 --> 00:19:13.070\nyou're not gonna find it here, right?\n\n354\n00:19:13.070 --> 00:19:17.350\nYou have to go to the old school\nWindows Features and right here,\n\n355\n00:19:17.350 --> 00:19:20.370\nyou will see Hyper-V.\n\n356\n00:19:20.370 --> 00:19:23.510\nIt's collapsed like this, and\nI can see a check mark in there.\n\n357\n00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:26.240\nIf I expand that out,\nI'll notice that there's actually\n\n358\n00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:30.063\nmany things I can install or\nchoose not to install.\n\n359\n00:19:30.063 --> 00:19:35.581\nThe Hyper-V Platform, Hyper-V Hypervisor,\nHyper-V services, those are the core\n\n360\n00:19:35.581 --> 00:19:40.960\ncomponents that make up Hyper-V, that's\nwhat allows me to do the virtualization.\n\n361\n00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:43.820\nAnd then right above that, you're\ngonna see the management tools, right?\n\n362\n00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:48.302\nWe got the GUI management tools and\nthe Hyper-V module for Windows PowerShell.\n\n363\n00:19:48.302 --> 00:19:52.976\nAnd we've got PowerShell commands to\nwork with Hyper-V, this will install it.\n\n364\n00:19:52.976 --> 00:19:55.060\nOf course, you can choose to\njust do the management tools.\n\n365\n00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:57.660\nIf you're gonna remotely\nmanage Hyper-V servers,\n\n366\n00:19:57.660 --> 00:19:59.830\nyou don't need the Hypervisor Platform.\n\n367\n00:19:59.830 --> 00:20:02.590\nYou can just do the management tools.\n\n368\n00:20:02.590 --> 00:20:04.620\nSo this is one way you can get\nit turned on, as you can see,\n\n369\n00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:07.400\nI have already have it installed.\n\n370\n00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:13.429\nKeep in mind it will take a reboot or\ntwo to get Hyper-V installed,\n\n371\n00:20:13.429 --> 00:20:17.280\nbecause remember,\nyou've got your hardware.\n\n372\n00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:20.340\nAnd then you've got your operating\nsystem sitting on top of that hardware.\n\n373\n00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:24.440\nWhat Hyper-V is gonna do is slip\nin between that hardware and\n\n374\n00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:26.100\nyour installed operating system.\n\n375\n00:20:27.170 --> 00:20:29.850\nSo it has to do a reboot\nas that process occurs,\n\n376\n00:20:29.850 --> 00:20:32.710\nas it slips that\nhypervisor layer in there.\n\n377\n00:20:32.710 --> 00:20:36.620\nSo it'll reboot a couple of times,\nI didn't want you guys to sit around and\n\n378\n00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:38.040\nwatch that.\n\n379\n00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:44.310\nThe other way we can do it is we can\ndo it through PowerShell, right?\n\n380\n00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:46.200\nAnd you know Microsoft loves PowerShell,\nso\n\n381\n00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:48.930\nknow this command just in\ncase you see it on the exam.\n\n382\n00:20:48.930 --> 00:20:53.290\nBut it's gonna be enable-windowsfeatures,\nI'm sorry,\n\n383\n00:20:53.290 --> 00:20:58.750\nWindowsOptionalFeature -online,\nto let it know you're\n\n384\n00:20:58.750 --> 00:21:03.700\nworking with the currently installed not\na target WIM file or anything like that.\n\n385\n00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:08.886\nYou're installing it right\nhere on this machine\n\n386\n00:21:08.886 --> 00:21:14.280\n-FeatureName:MicrosoftHyper-V and\n\n387\n00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:19.370\nthose dashes in between there, and\nthen- all if you want to include\n\n388\n00:21:19.370 --> 00:21:22.130\nthe management tools and\nall those sub-components.\n\n389\n00:21:22.130 --> 00:21:26.534\nSo that command right there would\nlaunch the install process.\n\n390\n00:21:26.534 --> 00:21:28.370\nI wonder what would happen if I\ntried to launch it right now?\n\n391\n00:21:28.370 --> 00:21:29.420\nShall we test it?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n392\n00:21:29.420 --> 00:21:30.580\nlet's test it.\n&gt;&gt; Great,\n\n393\n00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:32.910\nshe wants me to blow up\nmy machine right here.\n\n394\n00:21:32.910 --> 00:21:36.920\nIt should say that it's already installed,\nhopefully.\n\n395\n00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:41.318\nIt will say nothing required, there we go.\n&gt;&gt; So that was a lot faster than what\n\n396\n00:21:41.318 --> 00:21:44.551\nyou would have to normally go through\nthere, just when you saw those little\n\n397\n00:21:44.551 --> 00:21:46.440\ncircles go across.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.\n\n398\n00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:49.380\nIt would take a little bit longer and\nwould see restart needed false again,\n\n399\n00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:51.370\nbecause it was already installed.\n\n400\n00:21:51.370 --> 00:21:54.810\nNormally what would happen is it would,\nyou see those little circles going across\n\n401\n00:21:54.810 --> 00:21:59.030\na little bit slower and then we gonna get\nthe whole, Windows needs to restart to\n\n402\n00:21:59.030 --> 00:22:04.160\nfinish the process, Y for yes,\nN for no, A for all type thing.\n\n403\n00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:07.400\nYou hit Y, you reboot, you come back and\n\n404\n00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:12.540\nonce you finish,\nyou will have Hyper V installed.\n\n405\n00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:16.140\nAnd there it is, Hyper V manager.\n\n406\n00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:18.870\nNow we can launch Hyper-V.\n\n407\n00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:22.300\nSo not too terribly difficult to\nget it installed on Windows 10.\n\n408\n00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:24.630\nAgain, you've got your\nGUI method you can use.\n\n409\n00:22:24.630 --> 00:22:29.684\nAnd you've got your PowerShell, which\nmeans I can start scripting that out.\n\n410\n00:22:29.684 --> 00:22:32.779\nAll right, once we get it installed,\nthe couple of things I wanna do,\n\n411\n00:22:32.779 --> 00:22:34.660\njust the initial configuration.\n\n412\n00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:37.680\nAgain, I've already had it installed,\nwe had a couple of machines running.\n\n413\n00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:41.270\nJust so that we could do our demos\nlater on in these episodes, but\n\n414\n00:22:41.270 --> 00:22:42.670\nI want to show you a couple of things.\n\n415\n00:22:42.670 --> 00:22:44.240\nOnce you get it installed,\n\n416\n00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:48.040\nit would be wise to probably go\nthrough your Hyper-V settings.\n\n417\n00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:51.758\nOver here in the actions pane,\nI can click on Hyper-V settings,\n\n418\n00:22:51.758 --> 00:22:56.570\nand these are settings for the Hyper-V\nserver itself and you got a few of them.\n\n419\n00:22:56.570 --> 00:23:00.270\nReally, the only two that I'm\nconcerned with for this particular\n\n420\n00:23:00.270 --> 00:23:05.570\nWindows 10 class are these first two here,\nvirtual hard disks and virtual machines.\n\n421\n00:23:05.570 --> 00:23:09.270\nThese are going to be your\ndefault locations, and\n\n422\n00:23:09.270 --> 00:23:11.500\nI know that text is a little bit blurry.\n\n423\n00:23:13.250 --> 00:23:17.460\nBut basically, you're setting where,\nif you're gonna create a new VM or\n\n424\n00:23:17.460 --> 00:23:21.430\na new virtual hard disk, where is it gonna\nput it by default if I don't specify?\n\n425\n00:23:21.430 --> 00:23:24.020\nLike if I'm running this\ncommand from PowerShell and\n\n426\n00:23:24.020 --> 00:23:28.210\nI don't specify an absolute path,\nwhere is it gonna create that VHD?\n\n427\n00:23:28.210 --> 00:23:30.330\nSo I'm gonna be based on\nthese default locations.\n\n428\n00:23:30.330 --> 00:23:31.240\n&gt;&gt; So what do you do, Mike?\n\n429\n00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:35.170\nDo you keep them up this default location?\n&gt;&gt; I'm not a huge fan of putting these\n\n430\n00:23:35.170 --> 00:23:39.060\nvirtual disk, I mean, I know Microsoft\nhas that somewhere the default too and\n\n431\n00:23:39.060 --> 00:23:41.410\nit needs to be a location that\nthey know is gonna be available.\n\n432\n00:23:41.410 --> 00:23:46.398\nAnd it was actually dumping in public\ndocuments Hyper V virtual disks\n\n433\n00:23:46.398 --> 00:23:50.361\nwhich is not ideal because\nit's on my C drive, right?\n\n434\n00:23:50.361 --> 00:23:55.496\nWe're gonna have issues with contention\nif I start putting virtual machines\n\n435\n00:23:55.496 --> 00:24:00.085\non the same drive as my operating\nsystem is, as well as space issues.\n\n436\n00:24:00.085 --> 00:24:03.942\nAnd I don't want my operating system\nrunning out of hard disk space,\n\n437\n00:24:03.942 --> 00:24:07.660\nbecause virtual machine has\ngotten bigger than I expected.\n\n438\n00:24:07.660 --> 00:24:11.420\nAnd now, my operating system crashes,\nso I would definitely move these.\n\n439\n00:24:11.420 --> 00:24:16.110\nIt would be best if I could put\nthem on a separate hard drive.\n\n440\n00:24:16.110 --> 00:24:19.534\nAnd I don't mean a separate\nvolume on the same physical disk.\n\n441\n00:24:19.534 --> 00:24:24.190\nI mean a separate physical disk,\na separate spindle, separate disk I/O.\n\n442\n00:24:24.190 --> 00:24:27.320\nThat's gonna be a key to performance.\n\n443\n00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:29.000\nSo I would definitely move these.\n\n444\n00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:33.410\nTypically, I'll tell you what I do,\nand you can do your own thing.\n\n445\n00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:38.710\nNow, I don't know what my other drive is.\n\n446\n00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:42.670\nI get between three or four different\ncomputers, I get an e drive.\n\n447\n00:24:42.670 --> 00:24:48.410\nSo I just change this guy to\ne colon hyperv virtual disks,\n\n448\n00:24:48.410 --> 00:24:52.870\nand I don't know if that folder exists so\nit might balk at me here.\n\n449\n00:24:52.870 --> 00:25:00.170\nLet's just go out to e colon and\nwe'll use VMs.\n\n450\n00:25:00.170 --> 00:25:03.500\nI get another folder on their VMs and\nthen maybe I will put hard disk,\n\n451\n00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:05.380\nI will just leave it as VMs.\n\n452\n00:25:05.380 --> 00:25:08.300\nAnyway, whatever you wanna\nset that to is fine.\n\n453\n00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:12.410\nI would just recommend at least\ngetting the drives off your C Drive.\n\n454\n00:25:12.410 --> 00:25:16.330\nThe virtual machines themselves,\nthey go into program data,\n\n455\n00:25:16.330 --> 00:25:19.560\nusually the config file that\nmakes up the virtual machine.\n\n456\n00:25:21.330 --> 00:25:25.770\nStill wouldn't be bad to get\nthose off of the C drive, so\n\n457\n00:25:25.770 --> 00:25:28.570\nI'm gonna dump those over to my E drive,\nas well.\n\n458\n00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:31.640\nLet's go and set that there.\n\n459\n00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:34.080\nAnd then I'll go ahead and\napply both of those changes.\n\n460\n00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:36.500\nAnd now you can see I've\nchanged my default locations.\n\n461\n00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:39.230\nSo those are really the two big ones.\n\n462\n00:25:39.230 --> 00:25:43.877\nWe don't support virtualize and\nGPUs on Windows 10, the rest of these we\n\n463\n00:25:43.877 --> 00:25:48.690\nwill hit a little more when we look in\nour server classes and deal with Hyper V.\n\n464\n00:25:49.734 --> 00:25:53.065\nRight, so those are the basics\nof getting Hyper V installed,\n\n465\n00:25:53.065 --> 00:25:57.180\nwhat it takes to get it installed or\nwhat it takes to support Hyper-V right.\n\n466\n00:25:57.180 --> 00:26:01.880\nOur requirements and then how we can\nget it installed using both the GUI\n\n467\n00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:05.840\nas well as Power Shell, and then some\ninitial configuration to Hyper-V.\n\n468\n00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:08.400\nWe've still got a long way to go we've\ngotta create virtual hard drives,\n\n469\n00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:11.600\nwe've gotta create virtual machines, and\nwe've gotta create virtual switches.\n\n470\n00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:13.560\nSo we've still got a lot\nto talk about here.\n\n471\n00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:14.700\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I think we're ready.\n\n472\n00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:15.940\nI think we're ready to go here.\n\n473\n00:26:15.940 --> 00:26:19.990\nSo we were having a great introduction,\nso thank you for that, Mike.\n\n474\n00:26:19.990 --> 00:26:21.640\nAnd thank you guys for joining us as well.\n\n475\n00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:23.300\nBut for now, let's sign out.\n\n476\n00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:25.720\nI've been your host, Cherokee Boose.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n477\n00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:28.107\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n478\n00:26:28.107 --> 00:26:34.118\n[MUSIC]\n\n479\n00:26:34.118 --> 00:26:37.940\n&gt;&gt;

00:00:13.589\nwatching ITProTV.\n&gt;&gt; Welcome everyone to your configure\n\n4\n00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:16.599\nWindows devices series,\nI'm your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n5\n00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:19.583\nIn this episode we'll continue\ntaking a look here at Hyper-V.\n\n6\n00:00:19.583 --> 00:00:23.363\nAnd of course you know it Mr. Mike Rodrick\nin house to continue this topic,\n\n7\n00:00:23.363 --> 00:00:25.812\nhow's it going Mike?\n&gt;&gt; It's going great except for\n\n8\n00:00:25.812 --> 00:00:28.474\none of my machines is timing out on\nme as we're getting ready to start\n\n9\n00:00:28.474 --> 00:00:29.154\nthe show.\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n10\n00:00:29.154 --> 00:00:31.228\nI mean this is like the best time for\nit to happen, right?\n\n11\n00:00:31.228 --> 00:00:31.785\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n12\n00:00:31.785 --> 00:00:32.885\nThat I get to show you guys.\n\n13\n00:00:32.885 --> 00:00:34.434\nI've been doing great,\nthanks for having me.\n\n14\n00:00:34.434 --> 00:00:40.450\nExcited, continuing on discussing\nHyper-V on Windows 10 as we prepare for\n\n15\n00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:42.466\nthat 70-697 exam.\n\n16\n00:00:42.466 --> 00:00:43.396\nSo in the previous episode,\n\n17\n00:00:43.396 --> 00:00:45.234\nif you missed that make sure\nyou go back and check it out.\n\n18\n00:00:45.234 --> 00:00:48.519\nBut we got Hyper-V installed,\nwe talked about the requirements.\n\n19\n00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:51.611\nWhat do I need to get Hyper-V\non my Windows 10 machine?\n\n20\n00:00:51.611 --> 00:00:53.873\nWe looked at getting it installed\na couple of different ways.\n\n21\n00:00:53.873 --> 00:00:58.791\nAnd they show configuration of Hyper-V\nwhich there really isn't a whole lot\n\n22\n00:00:58.791 --> 00:01:01.751\nother than changing\nsome default locations.\n\n23\n00:01:01.751 --> 00:01:05.737\nSo the next thing we wanna do is start\ntalking about virtual machines and\n\n24\n00:01:05.737 --> 00:01:07.005\nvirtual hard drives.\n\n25\n00:01:07.005 --> 00:01:09.717\nActually we're creating\nsome virtual machines.\n\n26\n00:01:09.717 --> 00:01:12.431\nSo I thought we'd start with\nvirtual hard drives, and\n\n27\n00:01:12.431 --> 00:01:14.739\nI know that sounds like\nit might be backwards.\n\n28\n00:01:14.739 --> 00:01:17.600\nShouldn't we start with our virtual\nmachine and then worry about the drives.\n\n29\n00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.514\nBut when it comes down to it I'll show you\nas we go through it, when we go through\n\n30\n00:01:22.514 --> 00:01:27.140\nthe wizard you're very limited on what\nyou can do when you create a new VM.\n\n31\n00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.904\nSo a lot of times you are going to be\ncreating the virtual hard drive ahead\n\n32\n00:01:30.904 --> 00:01:31.418\nof time.\n\n33\n00:01:31.418 --> 00:01:33.909\nAnd so I thought we'd start\ntalking about that first and\n\n34\n00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:35.876\nkind of understand what's going on there.\n\n35\n00:01:35.876 --> 00:01:39.020\nThen we'll get into the world\nof creating VMs and\n\n36\n00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:44.246\nthen we'll start looking at networking\nthose VMs, that will be our last phase.\n\n37\n00:01:44.246 --> 00:01:48.786\nSo virtual hard drives,\nyou've heard it say VHD, that stands for\n\n38\n00:01:48.786 --> 00:01:50.253\nVirtual Hard Drive.\n\n39\n00:01:50.253 --> 00:01:55.095\nJust like you're physical machine needs\na hard drive to install the operating\n\n40\n00:01:55.095 --> 00:01:59.803\nsystem on to store files, to create\nyour profiles, ya know all that stuff.\n\n41\n00:01:59.803 --> 00:02:03.585\nSomewhere to store information that\nwhen we power that system down,\n\n42\n00:02:03.585 --> 00:02:05.550\nsame thing with virtual machines.\n\n43\n00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:10.166\nThey need hard drive space that they\ncan store their operating system.\n\n44\n00:02:10.166 --> 00:02:13.919\nAll their configurations, apps we've\ninstalled, and things like that.\n\n45\n00:02:13.919 --> 00:02:18.603\nSo a virtual machine, whereas\na physical machine uses a hard drive,\n\n46\n00:02:18.603 --> 00:02:21.693\na virtual machine uses\na virtual hard drive.\n\n47\n00:02:21.693 --> 00:02:26.267\nAnd it's simply a file located\non your physical disk that is\n\n48\n00:02:26.267 --> 00:02:28.378\ntreated like a hard drive.\n\n49\n00:02:28.378 --> 00:02:32.537\nTo the virtual machine that file is\ngonna look just like a hard drive.\n\n50\n00:02:32.537 --> 00:02:36.436\nIt says, there's my hard drive, it's so\nbig, I've got this much space I can\n\n51\n00:02:36.436 --> 00:02:39.190\ninstall operating system,\nI can install applications.\n\n52\n00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.883\nTreats it just like it\nwould a physical disk.\n\n53\n00:02:41.883 --> 00:02:44.260\nWe just call them VHDs or\nVirtual Hard Disk, right?\n\n54\n00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:44.844\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n55\n00:02:44.844 --> 00:02:48.980\nI have a feeling that's not it though.\n&gt;&gt; That's not it, all right.\n\n56\n00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:49.634\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n57\n00:02:49.634 --> 00:02:50.981\n&gt;&gt; We gotta go a little bit more\n\n58\n00:02:50.981 --> 00:02:53.041\nthan that, they've evolved over time.\n\n59\n00:02:53.041 --> 00:02:56.998\nSo we gotta talk about the format and\nthe type of these VHDs.\n\n60\n00:02:56.998 --> 00:02:58.168\nCuz they're not a physical disk, right?\n\n61\n00:02:58.168 --> 00:03:01.924\nI don't go down to the big box store and\nbuy a physical disk and\n\n62\n00:03:01.924 --> 00:03:04.219\nshove it into this virtual machine.\n\n63\n00:03:04.219 --> 00:03:07.263\nWe're gonna be creating this virtually,\nand\n\n64\n00:03:07.263 --> 00:03:12.266\nwe've got a lot more options that we\ncan do since it's not a physical thing.\n\n65\n00:03:12.266 --> 00:03:13.941\nSo let's talk about two things.\n\n66\n00:03:13.941 --> 00:03:17.524\nOne, is the format and then two,\nis going to be the type.\n\n67\n00:03:17.524 --> 00:03:23.008\nStarting with the format, so\nVHD's are back in the day a .VHD\n\n68\n00:03:23.008 --> 00:03:28.284\nfile in other words the extension\nwas .VHD you might have,\n\n69\n00:03:28.284 --> 00:03:31.888\nVirtualharddrive01.vhd, right?\n\n70\n00:03:31.888 --> 00:03:35.423\n[COUGH] These were the way we\nstarted out and they worked fine,\n\n71\n00:03:35.423 --> 00:03:39.318\nthey still do for that matter but\nthese are some limitations to it.\n\n72\n00:03:39.318 --> 00:03:44.122\nYou got a two tera byte file size limit,\nthat means that\n\n73\n00:03:44.122 --> 00:03:48.927\ndrive .VHD file cannot get\nbigger than 2 terabytes,\n\n74\n00:03:48.927 --> 00:03:52.071\nthat is the max size for those VHDs.\n\n75\n00:03:52.071 --> 00:03:57.045\nIt can be used though that .VHD can\nbe used by what's known as a gen 1\n\n76\n00:03:57.045 --> 00:04:02.131\nvirtual machine as well as\na generation 2 virtual machine, right?\n\n77\n00:04:02.131 --> 00:04:05.078\nA generation 2 virtual\nmachines within hyper v.\n\n78\n00:04:05.078 --> 00:04:09.904\nAllow me to use things like UEFI, some\nof my virtualized security options and\n\n79\n00:04:09.904 --> 00:04:11.102\nthings like that.\n\n80\n00:04:11.102 --> 00:04:13.381\nSo gento virtual machine just have.\n\n81\n00:04:13.381 --> 00:04:17.149\nWe'll talk a little bit more about\nthose when we get into virtual machine\n\n82\n00:04:17.149 --> 00:04:18.331\npart of our episodes.\n\n83\n00:04:18.331 --> 00:04:23.143\nBut just understand that .VHD can\nbe used by either a generation\n\n84\n00:04:23.143 --> 00:04:24.843\none virtual machine.\n\n85\n00:04:24.843 --> 00:04:27.916\nOr a generation two virtual machine,\neither one of them.\n\n86\n00:04:27.916 --> 00:04:31.042\nSo they're kind of multi purpose\nthere virtual hard drives.\n\n87\n00:04:31.042 --> 00:04:35.155\nBut again they had some limitations\nthat size limitation was the big one.\n\n88\n00:04:35.155 --> 00:04:42.396\nWith VHDXs, this is the newer format,\n.VHDX it's a four character extension.\n\n89\n00:04:42.396 --> 00:04:46.429\nAdd the X to the end of it and\nnow you've got the new format for\n\n90\n00:04:46.429 --> 00:04:47.974\nvirtual hard drives.\n\n91\n00:04:47.974 --> 00:04:52.133\nThese guys support up to\n64 terabytes in size, so\n\n92\n00:04:52.133 --> 00:04:57.660\nI can make a much larger virtual\nhard drive using this newer format.\n\n93\n00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:01.805\nAlso a lot of behind\nthe scenes improvements,\n\n94\n00:05:01.805 --> 00:05:07.232\nit's journaling,\nit keeps track of metadata and changes.\n\n95\n00:05:07.232 --> 00:05:11.471\nAnd again, that starts even way more\ntechnical than we need to for this exam.\n\n96\n00:05:11.471 --> 00:05:14.818\nBut what I do wanna make sure\nyou're aware of is, it supports,\n\n97\n00:05:14.818 --> 00:05:17.860\nit deals better with like power failures,\nfor example.\n\n98\n00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:21.639\nThis was a big problem with virtual\nmachines back in the day is that host\n\n99\n00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:23.126\noperating system failed.\n\n100\n00:05:23.126 --> 00:05:27.476\nThe power went out in the building or\nsomething that host shuts down, and\n\n101\n00:05:27.476 --> 00:05:29.987\nof course all the VMs on there would also.\n\n102\n00:05:29.987 --> 00:05:32.885\nIt's like pulling the plug on them and\nall of a sudden, boof, nothing.\n\n103\n00:05:32.885 --> 00:05:36.992\nAnd they would typically end up\ncorrupting the virtual hard drives.\n\n104\n00:05:36.992 --> 00:05:41.218\nYou'd lose the machines, or you'd have\nto figure out some way to recover them,\n\n105\n00:05:41.218 --> 00:05:43.093\nhopefully you had a back up of them.\n\n106\n00:05:43.093 --> 00:05:45.494\nBut VHDXs,\nwe don't have that same problem.\n\n107\n00:05:45.494 --> 00:05:47.512\nNot to say that it won't happen, but\n\n108\n00:05:47.512 --> 00:05:50.584\nthey're much better at dealing\nwith issues like that.\n\n109\n00:05:50.584 --> 00:05:55.155\nWe don't have that guarantee they're\ncorrupt now, because we lost power,\n\n110\n00:05:55.155 --> 00:05:58.263\nbecause they do this\njournaling in the background.\n\n111\n00:05:58.263 --> 00:06:02.050\nAlso some better aligned\nwith the way we sector and\n\n112\n00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:07.476\ncluster the physical disks the virtual\ndisks align better with those.\n\n113\n00:06:07.476 --> 00:06:12.050\nWhich just means we're gonna have much\nbetter performance out of those drives.\n\n114\n00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:15.865\nIf the underlying physical disk is\nusing one sector of cluster size.\n\n115\n00:06:15.865 --> 00:06:20.223\nAnd the VHD you're creating on top\nof that is using a different size,\n\n116\n00:06:20.223 --> 00:06:23.014\nnow I've got to translate between the two.\n\n117\n00:06:23.014 --> 00:06:26.742\nAnd I'm going to have to spend clock\ncycles doing that which is gonna reduce\n\n118\n00:06:26.742 --> 00:06:28.994\nmy performance.\n&gt;&gt; So Mike, that all sounds great.\n\n119\n00:06:28.994 --> 00:06:32.354\nWhy would I even think that\nusing a VHD versus a VHDX?\n\n120\n00:06:32.354 --> 00:06:34.061\nSo would that be mainly for\n\n121\n00:06:34.061 --> 00:06:36.689\nbackwards compatibility there?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n122\n00:06:36.689 --> 00:06:39.562\nit is really only if you have\na gen one virtual machine.\n\n123\n00:06:39.562 --> 00:06:44.274\nBecause the VHDXs can only be used\nby generation two virtual machines,\n\n124\n00:06:44.274 --> 00:06:47.034\ngeneration one won't understand them.\n\n125\n00:06:47.034 --> 00:06:51.737\nSo if you haven't, probably won't\nrun into it honestly nowadays but\n\n126\n00:06:51.737 --> 00:06:55.018\nif you needed a generation\none virtual machine.\n\n127\n00:06:55.018 --> 00:06:57.611\nOr you already have an existing\ngeneration one virtual machine.\n\n128\n00:06:57.611 --> 00:06:59.672\nAnd you need to add a second hard drive or\n\n129\n00:06:59.672 --> 00:07:02.362\nthird virtual hard drive\nto that virtual machine,\n\n130\n00:07:02.362 --> 00:07:06.566\nit's gonna have to be a VHD because\nthey're not gonna understand a VHD access.\n\n131\n00:07:06.566 --> 00:07:09.946\nSo it's exactly why they're here,\nit is backwards compatibility.\n\n132\n00:07:09.946 --> 00:07:14.938\nAlso understand that when we talk about\nvirtual hard drives We don't really\n\n133\n00:07:14.938 --> 00:07:16.422\nspecify VHD or VHDXs.\n\n134\n00:07:16.422 --> 00:07:20.242\nWe talk about virtual hard\ndrives in general, right.\n\n135\n00:07:20.242 --> 00:07:24.892\nIf we're talking about the format,\nwe'll specify .VHD or .VHDX, but\n\n136\n00:07:24.892 --> 00:07:29.182\nwhen you hear me talking about\nvirtual hard drive, don't assume.\n\n137\n00:07:29.182 --> 00:07:30.502\n&gt;&gt; Okay, hang up on the details to that?\n\n138\n00:07:30.502 --> 00:07:31.597\n&gt;&gt; Yes, exactly.\n\n139\n00:07:31.597 --> 00:07:35.204\nBecause most likely you're gonna\nbe working with VHDX files.\n\n140\n00:07:35.204 --> 00:07:39.180\nThat is the way that it go nowadays but\nwe just simplify it or\n\n141\n00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:42.761\ncategorize them all as\nvirtual hard drives or VHDX.\n\n142\n00:07:42.761 --> 00:07:45.234\nI know that can be confusing when\nyou first getting into it but\n\n143\n00:07:45.234 --> 00:07:48.413\nthat's the way it is.\n&gt;&gt; But not on the exam, they're gonna put\n\n144\n00:07:48.413 --> 00:07:52.767\n[LAUGHS], the details there.\n&gt;&gt; They'll be very specific if they need\n\n145\n00:07:52.767 --> 00:07:55.217\nyou to differentiate between the two.\n\n146\n00:07:55.217 --> 00:07:59.310\nBut if the talk about, hey, your\nvirtual hard drive they write that out,\n\n147\n00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:01.568\nyou don't know if they're saying VHD.\n\n148\n00:08:01.568 --> 00:08:04.261\nOr VHDX, all right?\n\n149\n00:08:04.261 --> 00:08:05.406\nAll right, so those are the two types.\n\n150\n00:08:05.406 --> 00:08:09.864\nThat's the first decision you're gonna\nmake as you're creating a new VHD,\n\n151\n00:08:09.864 --> 00:08:12.350\nis what is the format, VHD or VHDX?\n\n152\n00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:14.380\nThen we've gotta worry about the types,\nsorry I think I said type.\n\n153\n00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:17.628\nThat is the format, VHD or VHDX.\n\n154\n00:08:17.628 --> 00:08:22.510\nType, when we get into type, now we're\ntalking more about the physical layout of\n\n155\n00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:25.554\nthat virtual hard drive\nthat we're creating, and\n\n156\n00:08:25.554 --> 00:08:29.880\nthere's really three main types\nthat we're gonna deal with.\n\n157\n00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:36.100\nThere's fixed, there's dynamic, and\nthen there's differencing, all right?\n\n158\n00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:38.836\nAnd we need to understand\nthe difference between those,\n\n159\n00:08:38.836 --> 00:08:42.770\nwhat it means to that virtual hard drive,\nand where I would use these, all right?\n\n160\n00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:45.706\nWhat is a good use case scenario for\nthese drives?\n\n161\n00:08:45.706 --> 00:08:49.580\nThat might be a type of\nquestion you see on the exam.\n\n162\n00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:52.400\nSo let's start with fixed.\n\n163\n00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:56.020\nRemember when we talk about a virtual\nhard drive, we're talking about\n\n164\n00:08:56.020 --> 00:09:01.330\ntaking a chunk of available\nspace off my physical disk,\n\n165\n00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:06.400\nputting a file there, and then treating\nthat file as if it were a hard drive.\n\n166\n00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:09.250\nThat is my virtual hard drive,\nit is just a file.\n\n167\n00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:11.310\nIn fact, take a peek at my screen here.\n\n168\n00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:14.490\nI'm just gonna open up File Explorer.\n\n169\n00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:18.010\nActually, let me flip over to this guy.\n\n170\n00:09:18.010 --> 00:09:25.108\nOpen up File Explorer, and just to show\nyou that if I go into one of these guys,\n\n171\n00:09:25.108 --> 00:09:29.053\nthere is my virtual hard disk, all right?\n\n172\n00:09:29.053 --> 00:09:32.670\nSo this is on the host machine,\nthe one that's running hyper V.\n\n173\n00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:37.730\nI'm digging through File Explorer,\nfinding where I created my VMs, and\n\n174\n00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:41.510\ninside that folder structure\nI see virtual hard disk.\n\n175\n00:09:41.510 --> 00:09:42.632\nThere's my virtual machine.\n\n176\n00:09:42.632 --> 00:09:47.637\nThat's gonna be the config files, and\nthen there's my virtual hard disks,\n\n177\n00:09:47.637 --> 00:09:53.185\nand these are the virtual hard drives for\nthat VM, but that's simply a file, right?\n\n178\n00:09:53.185 --> 00:09:56.110\nLet's take a look here.\n\n179\n00:09:56.110 --> 00:10:01.741\nNow I've locked up Windows Explorer\ntrying to go to the View menu.\n\n180\n00:10:01.741 --> 00:10:05.590\nAgain, a little bit of\ndiscontention going on here.\n\n181\n00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:08.700\nAnyway, as soon as this comes\nback I can try to change it, but\n\n182\n00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:13.975\nI'll see that this is a .VHDX\nfile that I'm working with.\n\n183\n00:10:13.975 --> 00:10:20.532\nWhy is File Explorer There,\nnow you're sort of kind of working?\n\n184\n00:10:20.532 --> 00:10:21.821\nWell, we've lost File Explorer.\n\n185\n00:10:21.821 --> 00:10:24.119\nBut anyway, I'll come back to that and\nyou'll see it.\n\n186\n00:10:24.119 --> 00:10:29.750\nBut the point is,\nit's just a file on my physical disk.\n\n187\n00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:33.304\nSo, these three types That's why.\n\n188\n00:10:33.304 --> 00:10:36.010\nMy domain controller\nprobably went to sleep.\n\n189\n00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:39.438\nLet's wake that guy back up,\nand we'll let that work.\n\n190\n00:10:39.438 --> 00:10:43.694\nWhile those VMs are coming back alive,\nI didn't change the policy on them,\n\n191\n00:10:43.694 --> 00:10:44.901\nI just created them.\n\n192\n00:10:44.901 --> 00:10:47.428\nAnd so\nthe power settings are pretty aggressive,\n\n193\n00:10:47.428 --> 00:10:50.440\nand it's going to sleep after\na little bit of inactivity.\n\n194\n00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:54.255\nSo we'll move that out\nof the way down here.\n\n195\n00:10:54.255 --> 00:11:01.100\nAll right, so types of hard drives,\nfixed, dynamic, and differencing.\n\n196\n00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:06.560\nWhen we talk about a fixed disk,\nthat means if we create, let's just say,\n\n197\n00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:12.850\na 60 gigabyte virtual hard drive and\nwe choose to do a fixed type,\n\n198\n00:11:12.850 --> 00:11:19.650\nwhat Hyper-V is gonna do is it's gonna go\ngrab 60 gigabytes of physical disk space\n\n199\n00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:25.970\nand create a 60 gigabyte file that\nyour VMs can now use as a hard drive.\n\n200\n00:11:25.970 --> 00:11:30.480\nSo it's gonna allocate all of that space,\nthat means I need 60 gigs of free disk\n\n201\n00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:37.640\nspace on my host machine in order\nto create a 60 gigabyte, fixed VHD.\n\n202\n00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:43.165\nAs I start putting data in here, alright?\n\n203\n00:11:43.165 --> 00:11:47.269\nI can put more and more data in there,\nbut the size of the disk, or\n\n204\n00:11:47.269 --> 00:11:49.870\nthe file on my disk never changes.\n\n205\n00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:55.910\nThe VMCs 60 gigabyte hard drive,\nif you open up File Explorer in the VM,\n\n206\n00:11:55.910 --> 00:11:58.240\nyou'll see that you have\na 60 gigabyte hard drive.\n\n207\n00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:02.620\nIf I go to look at that\nfile on the host machine,\n\n208\n00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:07.267\nI will see a 60 gigabyte VHDX file.\n&gt;&gt; It is what is.\n\n209\n00:12:07.267 --> 00:12:07.962\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n210\n00:12:07.962 --> 00:12:12.340\neven if the VM has only put\n20 gigs of data in there.\n\n211\n00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:16.125\nLet's say I've installed my operating\nsystem and a couple files, and\n\n212\n00:12:16.125 --> 00:12:18.407\nit's only taken up about 25 gigabytes.\n\n213\n00:12:18.407 --> 00:12:23.620\nThere's still 35 gigabytes of\nunallocated space, or unused space.\n\n214\n00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:26.710\nThat doesn't change the size\nof the VHDX itself.\n\n215\n00:12:26.710 --> 00:12:31.166\nThat file will never change sizes,\nit is 60 gigabytes, hence the term fixed,\n\n216\n00:12:31.166 --> 00:12:32.095\nright?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n217\n00:12:32.095 --> 00:12:33.000\n&gt;&gt; It doesn't change.\n\n218\n00:12:34.310 --> 00:12:37.240\nThese are gonna be your\nbest performing drives,\n\n219\n00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:40.420\nand I'll explain why as\nwe look at the next one.\n\n220\n00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:44.343\nBut these are what you're gonna use in\nyour production environment, fixed disks,\n\n221\n00:12:44.343 --> 00:12:46.665\nand anytime you're worried\nabout performance,\n\n222\n00:12:46.665 --> 00:12:48.950\nyou're gonna be using fixed disks,\nall right?\n\n223\n00:12:48.950 --> 00:12:52.576\nNow let's see if it's playing around now.\n\n224\n00:12:52.576 --> 00:12:56.778\nWe'll go back over to that client,\nsee if I can open up File Explorer,\n\n225\n00:12:56.778 --> 00:12:59.450\nnavigate over to that E drive.\n\n226\n00:12:59.450 --> 00:13:02.962\nSo again, just going in there and\nshowing you virtual hard disks.\n\n227\n00:13:02.962 --> 00:13:07.162\nAnd if I change my view to\nshow that file extension,\n\n228\n00:13:07.162 --> 00:13:10.983\nthere you can see it is a VHDX file,\nall right?\n\n229\n00:13:10.983 --> 00:13:15.049\nYou'll also notice it's\nabout 10 gigabytes in size.\n\n230\n00:13:15.049 --> 00:13:19.000\nAnd we'll we come back, and we'll talk\na little bit more about that as we go.\n\n231\n00:13:20.430 --> 00:13:24.260\nAll right, so fixed, you're gonna allocate\nthat space, you have to have it available.\n\n232\n00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:25.760\nGreat performance out of these.\n\n233\n00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:27.477\nThey do not change sizes.\n\n234\n00:13:27.477 --> 00:13:30.645\nNo matter how much data's actually\nin the virtual hard drive,\n\n235\n00:13:30.645 --> 00:13:32.870\nit's always gonna be a 60 gigabyte file.\n\n236\n00:13:34.290 --> 00:13:37.300\nNext one is going to be dynamic disks.\n\n237\n00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:39.439\nAnd you can probably figure out, right?\n\n238\n00:13:39.439 --> 00:13:45.880\nIf fixed don't change,\ndynamic must change in some way, right?\n\n239\n00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:47.490\nAnd that's what they do.\n\n240\n00:13:47.490 --> 00:13:52.100\nThey will expand or grow as needed.\n\n241\n00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:57.860\nSo when you create a 60 gigabyte dynamic\ndisk, what Hyper-V is gonna do is it's\n\n242\n00:13:57.860 --> 00:14:02.540\ngonna go grab a chunk of physical disk\nspace, but it's not gonna be 60 gigabytes.\n\n243\n00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:05.284\nIt'll actually be about 4 megabytes,\nteeny tiny.\n\n244\n00:14:05.284 --> 00:14:10.602\nSo it'll be something like Oops,\nI do that every time.\n\n245\n00:14:10.602 --> 00:14:12.104\nAnd it'll be something like this.\n\n246\n00:14:12.104 --> 00:14:16.869\nAnd as my install, let's say I go and\ninstall an operating system,\n\n247\n00:14:16.869 --> 00:14:23.030\nit's gonna grow, and the virtual machine\nis always gonna see the 60 gigabytes.\n\n248\n00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:25.130\nSo the virtual machine,\nit's gonna look at that hard drive, and\n\n249\n00:14:25.130 --> 00:14:27.710\ngo, I've got a 60 gigabyte hard drive, but\n\n250\n00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:32.590\non the physical disk it's only taking\nup however much you're actually using.\n\n251\n00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:35.460\nIt's not pre-allocating 60 gigabytes.\n\n252\n00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:40.044\nSo if I install an operating system,\nand that takes about 20 gigabytes,\n\n253\n00:14:40.044 --> 00:14:44.845\nthe physical file, the vhdx itself,\nis only gonna be 20 gigabytes in size,\n\n254\n00:14:44.845 --> 00:14:47.857\neven though the virtual\nmachine sees it as 60.\n\n255\n00:14:47.857 --> 00:14:52.781\nAnd as I add things to that drive,\nit will start growing and\n\n256\n00:14:52.781 --> 00:14:55.530\ngrowing up to a maximum of 60.\n\n257\n00:14:55.530 --> 00:14:59.883\nSo when you create a dynamic disk,\nwhat you're really specifying is\n\n258\n00:14:59.883 --> 00:15:03.420\nthe maximum size that that\ndisk can grow to, all right.\n\n259\n00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:05.779\nNow, there's a big plus to this, right?\n\n260\n00:15:05.779 --> 00:15:09.940\nIf I'm creating a lot of VMs,\nI don't have a ton of disk space.\n\n261\n00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:13.760\nI don't wanna carve out 60 gigabytes\nat a time for each virtual machine.\n\n262\n00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:15.340\nIf I create three,\n\n263\n00:15:15.340 --> 00:15:20.100\nthat's 180 gigabytes that I've gotta have\nlaying around to create those three VHDs.\n\n264\n00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:21.700\nIf I'm using dynamic,\n\n265\n00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:24.290\nnow they're only taking up as much\nspace as they're actually using.\n\n266\n00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:29.590\nSo I can save a lot of disk space by using\ndynamic disks, and that's a good thing.\n\n267\n00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:32.050\nWe don't have to\npre-allocate all that space.\n\n268\n00:15:32.050 --> 00:15:35.731\nBut there's a downside to them as well,\nand that's performance.\n\n269\n00:15:35.731 --> 00:15:40.573\nThe performance that you're gonna get out\nof dynamic disk is not gonna be as good as\n\n270\n00:15:40.573 --> 00:15:45.420\nfixed, because of the fact that it's\ndynamic, because it has to grow.\n\n271\n00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:48.154\nLet's say I have I do that every time,\n\n272\n00:15:48.154 --> 00:15:51.050\ngrab the wrong little button there.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n273\n00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:52.040\n&gt;&gt; Let's say we've installed our\n\n274\n00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:52.910\noperating system and\n\n275\n00:15:52.910 --> 00:15:57.360\nit's taken up, I don't know, 20 something\ngigabytes of space in there, right?\n\n276\n00:15:57.360 --> 00:15:59.754\nAnd the disc grew to support that.\n\n277\n00:15:59.754 --> 00:16:04.123\nAnd now I'm gonna copy over a big fat,\nI don't know, a whole bunch of files.\n\n278\n00:16:04.123 --> 00:16:08.884\nAnd so, in order to squeeze those into the\nvirtual hard drive It's going to have to\n\n279\n00:16:08.884 --> 00:16:09.792\ngrow the VHDX.\n\n280\n00:16:09.792 --> 00:16:12.780\nWhat that means is, everything else stops.\n\n281\n00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:15.230\nWhile hyper v says all right\n&gt;&gt; Thinks about it.\n\n282\n00:16:15.230 --> 00:16:16.590\n&gt;&gt; Yeah you don't have enough space to\n\n283\n00:16:16.590 --> 00:16:19.270\ncopy those files to that VHDX.\n\n284\n00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:21.050\nHold on, I can grow it.\n\n285\n00:16:21.050 --> 00:16:24.140\nIt's dynamic, and\nit will grow the harddrive and\n\n286\n00:16:24.140 --> 00:16:26.060\nthen you can dump more data in there.\n\n287\n00:16:26.060 --> 00:16:30.070\nBut then later on, you wanna put more data\nin there, everything has to stop while it\n\n288\n00:16:30.070 --> 00:16:34.690\ngrows that hard drive and gives you\nmore space to put more data in there.\n\n289\n00:16:34.690 --> 00:16:36.770\nSo that's your first big performance hit,\n\n290\n00:16:36.770 --> 00:16:39.150\nis just the fact that\nit has to grow right?\n\n291\n00:16:39.150 --> 00:16:41.270\nSo every time you need\nto add more data and\n\n292\n00:16:41.270 --> 00:16:44.800\nit doesn't do it like, he's adding two\nmegabytes, I'm gonna grow two megabytes.\n\n293\n00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:49.390\nIt does kinda grow in chunks, so that it\ndoesn't have to do it continuously for\n\n294\n00:16:49.390 --> 00:16:52.470\nevery file you add or every app you add or\nanything like that, but\n\n295\n00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:57.410\nit still is a performance hit that\nwe're gonna see as that drive grows.\n\n296\n00:16:57.410 --> 00:16:59.630\nSo that's one.\n\n297\n00:16:59.630 --> 00:17:04.220\nThe other big performance hit you're\ngoing to deal with with dynamic disks,\n\n298\n00:17:04.220 --> 00:17:05.285\nis fragmentation.\n\n299\n00:17:05.285 --> 00:17:09.730\nNow, we're probably all familiar with\nwhat fragmentation is on hard drives,\n\n300\n00:17:09.730 --> 00:17:12.050\nwhere files are actually broken up and\n\n301\n00:17:12.050 --> 00:17:17.130\nnot stored in contiguous chunks\non the physical disk, all right?\n\n302\n00:17:17.130 --> 00:17:19.950\nBut when we talk about\nfragmentation of a VHD,\n\n303\n00:17:19.950 --> 00:17:24.190\nit's like a second level of fragmentation.\n\n304\n00:17:24.190 --> 00:17:25.430\nI'll show you what I mean.\n\n305\n00:17:25.430 --> 00:17:29.540\nLet say this green box\nrepresents my physical disk and\n\n306\n00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:34.320\nI've created a 60 gigabyte\ndynamic disk on my physical disk.\n\n307\n00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:39.080\nSo I've got a 60 gigabyte dynamic\nVHDX sitting here, right?\n\n308\n00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:42.450\nBut it's only taking up\nabout 20 gigabytes of space,\n\n309\n00:17:42.450 --> 00:17:46.240\nbecause all I've done is install\nan operating system, and nothing more.\n\n310\n00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:47.690\nSo, it's not using the full 60 gigs.\n\n311\n00:17:47.690 --> 00:17:49.660\nIt's only taking up about 20.\n\n312\n00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:53.122\nThen, through the normal\ncourse of the day,\n\n313\n00:17:53.122 --> 00:17:56.260\nI add, I write some more files\nto that hard drive, right?\n\n314\n00:17:56.260 --> 00:18:01.000\nWe know how Windows works, it's gonna find\nthe next available unallocated space, and\n\n315\n00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.180\nsave whatever it is I'm trying\nto write to the hard drive.\n\n316\n00:18:04.430 --> 00:18:10.180\nNow, my virtual machine needs to grow\nthe disk, but the problem is is it runs\n\n317\n00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:15.500\ninto this file right here or this folder,\nwhatever it was that was written to this.\n\n318\n00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:16.810\nAnd it can't grow anymore.\n\n319\n00:18:16.810 --> 00:18:21.270\nSo it has to go around that file and\ngrow over here.\n\n320\n00:18:22.330 --> 00:18:25.580\nAnd then you write some more\nfiles to your hard drive.\n\n321\n00:18:25.580 --> 00:18:28.200\nAnd then the virtual\ndisk needs to grow again.\n\n322\n00:18:29.250 --> 00:18:31.260\nIt has to go around that and\ngrow over here.\n\n323\n00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:34.240\nSo now my one virtual hard drive\n\n324\n00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:38.900\nis actually broken up into three\ndifferent pieces on the physical disk.\n\n325\n00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:41.150\nAnd we know fragmentation\ncauses performance hits.\n\n326\n00:18:41.150 --> 00:18:45.220\nBecause as I go to read,\nI have to stop, sign the pointer.\n\n327\n00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:46.870\nWhere's the pointer leading me to?\n\n328\n00:18:46.870 --> 00:18:48.310\nWhat sector is that?\n\n329\n00:18:48.310 --> 00:18:52.740\nSpin up the disk, move over to that\nsector and read the data from there.\n\n330\n00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:55.330\nAnd then stop again to go find this guy,\n\n331\n00:18:55.330 --> 00:18:59.770\nand if you try to fire up\nthe virtual machine and\n\n332\n00:18:59.770 --> 00:19:04.060\nyou do disk defragmentation from inside\nthere, it's not gonna fix this problem.\n\n333\n00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:08.050\nBecause the virtual machine's\ndrive is not what's fragmented.\n\n334\n00:19:08.050 --> 00:19:10.909\nIt's the physical disk here\nthat's fragmented, right?\n\n335\n00:19:10.909 --> 00:19:13.580\nThe VHD file itself is fragmented.\n\n336\n00:19:13.580 --> 00:19:16.405\nSo you've got to go and\ndefragment this physical disk.\n\n337\n00:19:16.405 --> 00:19:19.510\n[COUGH] So bad,\n\n338\n00:19:19.510 --> 00:19:24.780\nbad performance when it comes to\ndynamic as far as that growth process.\n\n339\n00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:26.770\nSo, should I use dynamics?\n\n340\n00:19:26.770 --> 00:19:27.750\nI still use them.\n\n341\n00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:30.180\nIf I'm spinning up a test environment and\n\n342\n00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:36.170\nI don't wanna allocate 120 gigabytes of\nhard drive space, I definitely go dynamic.\n\n343\n00:19:36.170 --> 00:19:37.420\nNot worried about performance.\n\n344\n00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:41.330\nI don't have users trying\nto access the machine and\n\n345\n00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:46.300\nhave to worry about maintaining a SLA or\na certain level of performance, right?\n\n346\n00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:47.546\n&gt;&gt; To look at that forecast or\n\n347\n00:19:47.546 --> 00:19:54.280\nusability and say hey, look, I'm exceeding\nmy expected storage capacity here.\n\n348\n00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:57.010\nSo, Mike knows what's\nhe's gonna be doing and\n\n349\n00:19:57.010 --> 00:19:58.260\nthat's all he's worried about.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n350\n00:19:58.260 --> 00:19:58.860\nExactly.\n\n351\n00:19:58.860 --> 00:20:01.330\nSo, dynamic disks\nare definitely an option.\n\n352\n00:20:01.330 --> 00:20:04.920\nJust keep in mind you will not\nbe using these in production.\n\n353\n00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:06.980\nYou also can't convert.\n\n354\n00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:08.170\nThere probably is.\n\n355\n00:20:08.170 --> 00:20:12.000\nI shouldn't say that, cuz I haven't\nresearched that, but it's not easy to just\n\n356\n00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:17.280\ngo in and say hey, I wanna convert this\nfrom a fixed to a dynamic or vice versa.\n\n357\n00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:17.860\nI should check on that\nbefore I actually say it.\n\n358\n00:20:17.860 --> 00:20:20.743\n&gt;&gt; I was really surprised just dealing\n\n359\n00:20:20.743 --> 00:20:25.748\nwith the converting MBR to the GPT or\nin the operating system.\n\n360\n00:20:25.748 --> 00:20:29.738\nSo you see Microsoft has done some pretty\nawesome things with the management of\n\n361\n00:20:29.738 --> 00:20:32.480\nthese disks lately.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.\n\n362\n00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:35.010\nProbably has a little wizard\nthat will allow me to do that.\n\n363\n00:20:35.010 --> 00:20:39.460\nAs I say, you can't say, I should\nhold off on that but plan, all right.\n\n364\n00:20:39.460 --> 00:20:40.900\nThis is where planning comes into play.\n\n365\n00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:44.890\nIf I making a virtual machine that I know\nis eventually gonna get into production,\n\n366\n00:20:44.890 --> 00:20:46.400\nI'm gonna start with a fixed disk.\n\n367\n00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:49.000\nI'm not gonna create a dynamic disk for\nit.\n\n368\n00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.150\nIf I'm spinning up a little test lab,\n\n369\n00:20:51.150 --> 00:20:56.400\njust to try out some new Windows Insider\nPreview, that Windows 10 machine will most\n\n370\n00:20:56.400 --> 00:21:00.950\nlikely use a dynamic disk because I'm not\nworried about super high performance, so.\n\n371\n00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:06.330\nThose are dynamic disks, and some of\nthe downfalls of working with those,\n\n372\n00:21:06.330 --> 00:21:07.650\nas well as some of the good things about.\n\n373\n00:21:08.650 --> 00:21:13.200\nThe last type I wanna show you is\nsomething known as differencing disks.\n\n374\n00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:16.560\nDifferencing disks are a really\ninteresting drive.\n\n375\n00:21:17.850 --> 00:21:19.100\nThey're called differencing.\n\n376\n00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:21.030\nDid I spell differencing right?\n\n377\n00:21:21.030 --> 00:21:22.810\nMake sure I spelled that right.\n\n378\n00:21:22.810 --> 00:21:26.770\nThey're called differencing because\nthey're gonna store the differences\n\n379\n00:21:26.770 --> 00:21:30.810\nbetween itself, and some parent VHD.\n\n380\n00:21:30.810 --> 00:21:36.221\nWe end up creating this parent-child\nrelationship between virtual hard drives,\n\n381\n00:21:36.221 --> 00:21:37.001\nall right?\n\n382\n00:21:37.001 --> 00:21:41.844\nAnd these have some really neat benefits\nthat we can use, or take advantage of,\n\n383\n00:21:41.844 --> 00:21:46.978\nthey also have some serious performance\nissues that we're gonna have to deal with,\n\n384\n00:21:46.978 --> 00:21:48.130\nas well.\n\n385\n00:21:48.130 --> 00:21:53.400\nRight, so the way this works is,\nI'm gonna take a parent VHD,\n\n386\n00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:56.440\nlet's say I've got my\noperating system installed,\n\n387\n00:21:56.440 --> 00:22:00.600\nI've got some common files,\nanything like that.\n\n388\n00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:01.750\nI went ahead and installed everything,\n\n389\n00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:04.670\nI did my Windows updates maybe and\nall of that.\n\n390\n00:22:04.670 --> 00:22:09.440\nNow, I'm going to create a new VHD,\nand I'm gonna choose differencing.\n\n391\n00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:14.020\nAnd when I do this, it's going to ask me,\nwell, where is the parent VHD?\n\n392\n00:22:14.020 --> 00:22:16.770\nAnd I'm going to point it to here.\n\n393\n00:22:16.770 --> 00:22:21.630\nSo I'll create a new VM using\nthis differencing disk, and\n\n394\n00:22:21.630 --> 00:22:24.450\nit will write all of its changes to here.\n\n395\n00:22:24.450 --> 00:22:31.770\nBut it will still go back to the parent\nVHD to get those base files, if you will.\n\n396\n00:22:31.770 --> 00:22:34.620\nI use this technique often.\n\n397\n00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:35.870\nI don't do it as much anymore,\n\n398\n00:22:35.870 --> 00:22:38.830\nbecause I've got this nice beefy\nmachine that ITProTV got me.\n\n399\n00:22:38.830 --> 00:22:41.750\nBut I remember first breaking\ninto virtualization,\n\n400\n00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:44.780\ndifferencing disks were,\nI utilized them a lot.\n\n401\n00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:47.640\nBecause let's say I need to spin up a lab.\n\n402\n00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:52.850\nAnd I need three server 2016\nmachines in my little test lab.\n\n403\n00:22:52.850 --> 00:22:55.457\nWell, if I'm using fixed or dynamic,\n\n404\n00:22:55.457 --> 00:22:59.491\nI'm going to install server\n2016 three times, right?\n\n405\n00:22:59.491 --> 00:23:01.400\nTo create each one of\nthose virtual machines.\n\n406\n00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:04.700\nI'm gonna do Windows updates\non those machines three times,\n\n407\n00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:06.780\neach one of those needs to be updated,\nright?\n\n408\n00:23:06.780 --> 00:23:09.540\nBut now I have got three virtual machines.\n\n409\n00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:14.436\nOr I could install server\n2016 once here on a VHD and\n\n410\n00:23:14.436 --> 00:23:17.637\nI could do all the Windows updates.\n\n411\n00:23:17.637 --> 00:23:22.269\nThen I could set that drive aside and\nI could make three new VMs,\n\n412\n00:23:22.269 --> 00:23:27.640\nusing differencing disks that all\npoint back to the parent VHD.\n\n413\n00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:32.350\nThey've already got Windows Server 2016\ninstalled and all of the updates, so\n\n414\n00:23:32.350 --> 00:23:34.800\nI can spin this up,\nI could spin up another one.\n\n415\n00:23:36.191 --> 00:23:39.224\nRight and just point it to,\n\n416\n00:23:40.982 --> 00:23:45.220\nIf I can get this over here, right,\npoint it back to that parent.\n\n417\n00:23:45.220 --> 00:23:49.510\nIf I want another one,\nI just sped up another one, and\n\n418\n00:23:49.510 --> 00:23:52.020\npoint it back to the parent.\n\n419\n00:23:52.020 --> 00:23:54.330\nI don't have to install anything, alright?\n\n420\n00:23:54.330 --> 00:23:58.618\nSo in this one maybe I installed ENS on\nthis one I installed EHTP, on this one I\n\n421\n00:23:58.618 --> 00:24:03.046\ndon't know I had to make my domain\ncontroller alright or something like that.\n\n422\n00:24:03.046 --> 00:24:08.698\nAll based off of this same parent VHD,\nso in order to install server 2016 Once,\n\n423\n00:24:08.698 --> 00:24:14.046\nthe only thing that's stored in here is\ngonna be the fact that I installed DNS.\n\n424\n00:24:14.046 --> 00:24:17.608\nThat's different from this guy right,\ndifferencing disks,\n\n425\n00:24:17.608 --> 00:24:19.297\nthey store the differences.\n\n426\n00:24:19.297 --> 00:24:23.854\nEverything that's the same gets\nstored in here, all right?\n\n427\n00:24:23.854 --> 00:24:26.547\nNow, a couple things about these\ndifferencing disks and I'll show you,\n\n428\n00:24:26.547 --> 00:24:29.588\nwe'll get into another episode and I'll\nshow you, we'll create some of these and\n\n429\n00:24:29.588 --> 00:24:31.720\nit'll probably make a little more sense.\n\n430\n00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:33.240\nYou have to be really careful with these.\n\n431\n00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:37.426\nFirst off, this parent vhd cannot change.\n\n432\n00:24:37.426 --> 00:24:41.650\nOnce you create a differencing disk\nthat points back to the parent,\n\n433\n00:24:41.650 --> 00:24:45.440\nif the parent ever changes,\nyou break that link.\n\n434\n00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:48.400\nIt'll no longer recognize\nit as the parent.\n\n435\n00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:49.840\nAnd it won't work anymore.\n\n436\n00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:54.740\nSo this disk cannot change once I\npoint a differencing disk to it.\n\n437\n00:24:54.740 --> 00:25:00.010\nMany times, we actually go into\nthe file system and mark the parent vhd\n\n438\n00:25:00.010 --> 00:25:04.390\nas read-only, because I don't wanna\ntake a chance on this changing.\n\n439\n00:25:04.390 --> 00:25:08.190\nBecause, now, if this changes,\nI don't lose one machine.\n\n440\n00:25:08.190 --> 00:25:12.220\nBut I would lose all three of my machines\nthat I had based off of that parent.\n\n441\n00:25:12.220 --> 00:25:13.280\nSo something to be aware of.\n\n442\n00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:17.090\nThe parent drive cannot change once\nyou create a differencing disk\n\n443\n00:25:17.090 --> 00:25:17.890\nthat points to it.\n\n444\n00:25:19.106 --> 00:25:24.970\nPerformance is not gonna be all that\ngood because DNS is installed here,\n\n445\n00:25:24.970 --> 00:25:30.650\nDHCP is here, but the core Windows Server\n2016 files are all back here.\n\n446\n00:25:30.650 --> 00:25:33.090\nSo if these two machines\nare running at the same time,\n\n447\n00:25:33.090 --> 00:25:36.240\nthey're both gonna be reading from\ntheir own differencing disk, but\n\n448\n00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:41.530\nthey're also both gonna hitting that\nparent vhd for all the common files.\n\n449\n00:25:41.530 --> 00:25:46.440\nIf I fire up a third machine,\nit's also reaching back to the parent vhd.\n\n450\n00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:51.502\nSo I've got a lot of disk contention for\nreads going to that parent disk,\n\n451\n00:25:51.502 --> 00:25:55.470\nI've got three different VMs all trying\nto read from that one parent disk, and\n\n452\n00:25:55.470 --> 00:25:59.040\nthat can cause some serious\nperformance issues.\n\n453\n00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:02.180\nSo this is definitely something that you\nwon't see in a production environment,\n\n454\n00:26:02.180 --> 00:26:06.890\nthis is not even a consideration for\nthe most part.\n\n455\n00:26:06.890 --> 00:26:09.790\nBut in test labs where space is limited or\n\n456\n00:26:09.790 --> 00:26:13.320\ntime is a concern, right,\nthis is the way to go.\n\n457\n00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:20.096\nI've talked on the other shows I have a\nvirtual hard drive that has a sys prepped\n\n458\n00:26:20.096 --> 00:26:25.574\n2016 machine, 2012 machine,\nWindows 10 machine, Windows 8 machine.\n\n459\n00:26:25.574 --> 00:26:28.662\nIf I ever need to I can just\nspin up a differencing disk and\n\n460\n00:26:28.662 --> 00:26:32.102\npoint it back to those guys and\nspin up a machine really quick.\n\n461\n00:26:32.102 --> 00:26:34.711\nI don't have to worry about installation-\n&gt;&gt; That's a great idea.\n\n462\n00:26:34.711 --> 00:26:35.566\n&gt;&gt; Don't have to worry about updates.\n\n463\n00:26:35.566 --> 00:26:36.341\nIt's ready to go.\n\n464\n00:26:36.341 --> 00:26:39.186\nSo if I just need to hey,\nI wonder if this will work on Windows 10.\n\n465\n00:26:39.186 --> 00:26:42.800\nI can spin up a new differencing\ndisk based off of that parent disk.\n\n466\n00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:43.810\nTry it out.\n\n467\n00:26:43.810 --> 00:26:44.842\nBlow it away.\n\n468\n00:26:44.842 --> 00:26:47.840\nThe parent disk didn't change so if I\never need another one, it's still there.\n\n469\n00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:50.685\nI can just create my differencing\nall over again, all right?\n\n470\n00:26:50.685 --> 00:26:53.655\nSo really good for certain scenarios.\n\n471\n00:26:53.655 --> 00:26:55.504\nAnd that's the key here, I think.\n\n472\n00:26:55.504 --> 00:27:00.480\nAnd as you're preparing for this exam, is\nunderstanding about these different types,\n\n473\n00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:03.070\nfixed, dynamic, and differencing.\n\n474\n00:27:03.070 --> 00:27:05.970\nAnd understanding where I would\nuse them or when I would want to\n\n475\n00:27:05.970 --> 00:27:10.650\nuse one over the other and\nit really comes down to performance.\n\n476\n00:27:10.650 --> 00:27:12.220\nNow, I know we're getting short on time.\n\n477\n00:27:12.220 --> 00:27:17.210\nI'll wrap this up with,\nMicrosoft has definitely said that their\n\n478\n00:27:17.210 --> 00:27:21.460\ndynamic disks have much better\nperformance than it did a year or two or\n\n479\n00:27:21.460 --> 00:27:23.760\nthree years ago and that's true.\n\n480\n00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:28.340\nThey have made a lot of improvements\nto those dynamic disks to help\n\n481\n00:27:28.340 --> 00:27:30.050\nwith that performance.\n\n482\n00:27:30.050 --> 00:27:33.490\nIs it enough to where I might consider\nusing a dynamic disk in production?\n\n483\n00:27:33.490 --> 00:27:37.840\nI think that's something that\nyou're gonna have to try.\n\n484\n00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:42.130\nMicrosoft says yes, me,\nfrom what I've seen, no.\n\n485\n00:27:42.130 --> 00:27:47.070\nBut it also has other factors that\nare gonna come into play, right?\n\n486\n00:27:47.070 --> 00:27:50.180\nMe using two virtual\nmachines here on my laptop,\n\n487\n00:27:50.180 --> 00:27:55.240\nboth using dynamic disks, the performance\nis horrible, absolutely atrocious.\n\n488\n00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:56.920\nI can't do shows with them.\n\n489\n00:27:56.920 --> 00:28:00.970\nBut that's because my laptop has\na single physical disk, and all of\n\n490\n00:28:00.970 --> 00:28:05.540\nthe vhd's are stored on that one spindle,\nso I've got a lot of disk contention.\n\n491\n00:28:05.540 --> 00:28:08.320\nSo if one of those drives\ndecides it's time to grow,\n\n492\n00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:10.780\neverything else suffers, right?\n\n493\n00:28:10.780 --> 00:28:15.710\nIf this was a production server and\nI had RAID 5,\n\n494\n00:28:15.710 --> 00:28:21.010\nRAID 10 under those virtual hard drives,\nmaybe the performance hit of dynamic disks\n\n495\n00:28:21.010 --> 00:28:24.630\nwouldn't be significant enough\nto impact my performance, right?\n\n496\n00:28:24.630 --> 00:28:27.310\nSo that's definitely something that\nyou're gonna have to test, and\n\n497\n00:28:27.310 --> 00:28:29.280\nit goes beyond just type.\n\n498\n00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:32.460\nIt also has to do with that underlying\narchitecture that you're using.\n\n499\n00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:35.570\nSo I can't tell you you'll\nnever use them in production.\n\n500\n00:28:35.570 --> 00:28:38.580\nMicrosoft will tell you that\nthey've made great improvements and\n\n501\n00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:40.820\nthat it is possible to\nuse them in production.\n\n502\n00:28:40.820 --> 00:28:43.800\nBut it's something that I would\ndefinitely want to test out.\n\n503\n00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:47.160\nDifferencing disks, yeah,\nprobably not either.\n\n504\n00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:50.520\nBut again, Microsoft has made\ngreat strides to make them better.\n\n505\n00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:53.270\nIt's definitely something that\nyou're gonna have to test out.\n\n506\n00:28:53.270 --> 00:28:57.957\nSo those are the look at the different\ntypes of vhd's we can create.\n\n507\n00:28:57.957 --> 00:29:01.743\nAlso the format of those vhd's, when we\ncome back we'll actually create some of\n\n508\n00:29:01.743 --> 00:29:04.592\nthose VHD's, cuz I know that's\nreally what you wanna see.\n\n509\n00:29:04.592 --> 00:29:05.708\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's the fun stuff.\n\n510\n00:29:05.708 --> 00:29:07.559\nSo, thanks Mike, but not that this wasn't.\n\n511\n00:29:07.559 --> 00:29:10.532\nThis was great information so\nwe appreciate that as well,\n\n512\n00:29:10.532 --> 00:29:13.513\nwe appreciate you for being here but\nwe are gonna sign

00:00:18.053\nto your Configure Windows Devices series,\nstudying for that 70-697 exam.\n\n7\n00:00:18.053 --> 00:00:19.937\nI'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n8\n00:00:19.937 --> 00:00:24.108\nSo we're actually here to part three\nwhere we're continue looking at Hyper-V.\n\n9\n00:00:24.108 --> 00:00:27.669\nBut specifically Mike said he was gonna\nshow us how to create some disks.\n\n10\n00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:29.594\nSo what do you say, Mike?\n&gt;&gt; Did I say that?\n\n11\n00:00:29.594 --> 00:00:31.039\nI don't remember saying that.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n12\n00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:31.662\n&gt;&gt; I don't know what you're talking about.\n\n13\n00:00:31.662 --> 00:00:32.402\n&gt;&gt; I think that's what he said.\n\n14\n00:00:32.402 --> 00:00:32.978\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n15\n00:00:32.978 --> 00:00:34.177\n&gt;&gt; I was listening, I swear.\n\n16\n00:00:34.177 --> 00:00:35.173\n&gt;&gt; What do you guys think?\n\n17\n00:00:35.173 --> 00:00:37.785\nYeah, of course we're gonna take\na look at creating it, right?\n\n18\n00:00:37.785 --> 00:00:41.269\nWe did spend a lot of time\ndiscussing virtual hard drives,\n\n19\n00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:46.173\nthe different formats, VHD versus VHDX,\nas well as the types that we can create,\n\n20\n00:00:46.173 --> 00:00:48.040\nfixed dynamic differencing.\n\n21\n00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:49.831\nWe didn't get to actually do any, right?\n\n22\n00:00:49.831 --> 00:00:51.548\nWe spent a lot of time looking\nat drawings and stuff.\n\n23\n00:00:51.548 --> 00:00:55.991\nAnd now we wanna see it in action,\nso that is what we're going to do.\n\n24\n00:00:55.991 --> 00:00:58.896\nSo let's just take a look\nat my screen here.\n\n25\n00:00:58.896 --> 00:01:03.009\nAnd I've got my Hyper-V Manager\nconsole opened up.\n\n26\n00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:06.585\nNow, when we create VHDs,\nwe can create them ahead of time, or\n\n27\n00:01:06.585 --> 00:01:10.035\nwe can create them during\nthe creation of a virtual machine.\n\n28\n00:01:10.035 --> 00:01:13.946\nIf you go through the Virtual\nMachine Wizard, new virtual machine,\n\n29\n00:01:13.946 --> 00:01:18.138\nit'll have you either create a new VHD or\nattach an existing, all right?\n\n30\n00:01:18.138 --> 00:01:22.648\nNow, I'll show you some of the limitations\nof that as we start creating virtual\n\n31\n00:01:22.648 --> 00:01:23.333\nmachines.\n\n32\n00:01:23.333 --> 00:01:24.627\nBut you can also create\nthem ahead of time.\n\n33\n00:01:24.627 --> 00:01:31.542\nThere is a separate wizard, we look over\nhere, where I have New, Hard Disk, right?\n\n34\n00:01:31.542 --> 00:01:37.841\nAnd that's what we're gonna focus in on\nhere first, is creating these VHDs, right?\n\n35\n00:01:37.841 --> 00:01:39.256\nSo let me zoom back out.\n\n36\n00:01:39.256 --> 00:01:42.540\nHere is my wizard, and\nyou got your good old intro screen.\n\n37\n00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.626\nAnd I'm gonna click Next, and what I\nwant you to look at is the steps, right?\n\n38\n00:01:45.626 --> 00:01:48.110\nChoose Disk Format, Choose Disk Type.\n\n39\n00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.058\nThose are the two things that we just\ngot done talking about in the previous\n\n40\n00:01:52.058 --> 00:01:56.531\nepisode, what is the format I wanna use,\nwhat is the type I want to create, right?\n\n41\n00:01:56.531 --> 00:02:03.579\nSo in our wizard here,\nwe can see I've got VHD, VHDX, or VHD Set.\n\n42\n00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:07.550\nBut remember what we talked\nabout in the requirements?\n\n43\n00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:11.086\nThat VHDs are not supported\nin Windows 10 Hyper-V.\n\n44\n00:02:11.086 --> 00:02:12.101\nThis will tell you,\n\n45\n00:02:12.101 --> 00:02:16.352\nit says the format is not supported in\noperating systems earlier than Windows 10.\n\n46\n00:02:16.352 --> 00:02:20.500\nFor this exam, I would stick with\nthe fact that these aren't supported.\n\n47\n00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.409\nThey might be adding that,\nwhich is great, but\n\n48\n00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:27.643\nas of now I would say they're not\nsupported in the client side hyper.\n\n49\n00:02:27.643 --> 00:02:30.115\nSo it is one of the differences, right?\n\n50\n00:02:30.115 --> 00:02:36.043\nBetween running Hyper-V on a server 2016\nbox versus running Hyper-V in Windows 10,\n\n51\n00:02:36.043 --> 00:02:36.578\nright?\n\n52\n00:02:36.578 --> 00:02:39.187\nSo we can choose whichever, VHD or VHDX.\n\n53\n00:02:39.187 --> 00:02:42.389\nIt gives you a little summary about\nwhat we talked about earlier.\n\n54\n00:02:42.389 --> 00:02:45.403\nThe differences in which one\nyou might want to choose.\n\n55\n00:02:45.403 --> 00:02:49.964\nI'm gonna choose VHDX and\nwe'll click Next.\n\n56\n00:02:49.964 --> 00:02:52.674\nThen we've got our type.\n\n57\n00:02:52.674 --> 00:02:57.122\nI can do Fixed, Dynamically Expanding,\nor Differencing.\n\n58\n00:02:57.122 --> 00:02:59.154\nWe're gonna start with Fixed.\n\n59\n00:02:59.154 --> 00:03:03.276\nAnd again it does give you a nice little\ndescription of each one of those,\n\n60\n00:03:03.276 --> 00:03:04.433\nin case you forgot.\n\n61\n00:03:04.433 --> 00:03:07.351\nI'll start with Fixed,\nand then we'll click Next.\n\n62\n00:03:07.351 --> 00:03:11.822\nNow, I've gotta tell it where\nI want to store this VHD, and\n\n63\n00:03:11.822 --> 00:03:16.571\nyou can see I've gotta give it a name,\nas well as the location.\n\n64\n00:03:16.571 --> 00:03:23.728\nSo I'm gonna call this one,\nfixed01, all right?\n\n65\n00:03:23.728 --> 00:03:28.514\nAnd for the location,\nwe're gonna change this up just a wee bit,\n\n66\n00:03:28.514 --> 00:03:31.134\nso we can find them a little easier.\n\n67\n00:03:31.134 --> 00:03:35.992\nI'm gonna come in here and\ncreate a new folder called VHDs,\n\n68\n00:03:35.992 --> 00:03:39.699\nagain, just so\nwe can find them for the show.\n\n69\n00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:43.523\nLet me zoom back out so\nI can navigate, all right?\n\n70\n00:03:43.523 --> 00:03:47.671\nSo I've changed where that's gonna go and\nI've changed the name of the file.\n\n71\n00:03:47.671 --> 00:03:51.008\nNotice when I changed the name,\nI didn't put the extension back?\n\n72\n00:03:51.008 --> 00:03:53.230\nI could, I could add .vhdx.\n\n73\n00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:54.029\nIt'll do it,\n\n74\n00:03:54.029 --> 00:03:58.634\nI've already told it that I'm creating\na vhdx, it'll add the extension for me.\n\n75\n00:03:58.634 --> 00:04:00.670\nI'll click Next.\n\n76\n00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:03.191\nAnd how big do I want it to be?\n\n77\n00:04:03.191 --> 00:04:05.067\nHere's where you wanna be careful,\nall right?\n\n78\n00:04:05.067 --> 00:04:08.998\nCreating a fixed disk,\nthat means it's gonna go ahead and\n\n79\n00:04:08.998 --> 00:04:12.221\ngrab whatever space I allocate for\nthis drive.\n\n80\n00:04:12.221 --> 00:04:15.322\nAnd depending on your performance,\nif you're creating\n\n81\n00:04:15.322 --> 00:04:18.800\n127-gigabyte hard drive.\n&gt;&gt; What does my physical hard drive look\n\n82\n00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:21.004\nlike?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, do I have enough free space,\n\n83\n00:04:21.004 --> 00:04:24.570\nfirst of all, and do I have enough\ntime to wait for it to create that?\n\n84\n00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:28.856\nBecause it's gonna take\nlonger to create this.\n\n85\n00:04:28.856 --> 00:04:30.517\nSo I'm gonna go very, very small.\n\n86\n00:04:30.517 --> 00:04:37.944\nI'm gonna say I wanna do 1 gigabyte,\nif you let me here.\n\n87\n00:04:37.944 --> 00:04:41.627\n[COUGH] So\nI'm gonna create a 1 gigabyte file.\n\n88\n00:04:41.627 --> 00:04:45.785\nI'll click Next and then Finish.\n\n89\n00:04:48.358 --> 00:04:49.283\nAll right, and so\n\n90\n00:04:49.283 --> 00:04:53.128\nnow it's going through the process\nof creating that virtual hard drive.\n\n91\n00:04:53.128 --> 00:04:57.111\nAgain, 1 gigabyte, not big,\nit's not gonna take it all that long.\n\n92\n00:04:57.111 --> 00:05:00.453\nSo that took maybe what, 10,\n15 seconds or something like that.\n\n93\n00:05:00.453 --> 00:05:05.182\nIf I go take a look in File Explorer and\nI take a look inside VHDs,\n\n94\n00:05:05.182 --> 00:05:08.770\nthere's fixed01 that we've just created.\n\n95\n00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:14.676\nAnd if we take a look at that size,\nit's 1 gigabyte in size.\n\n96\n00:05:14.676 --> 00:05:20.883\nSo according to my host machine, I now\nhave a file that is 1 gigabyte in size.\n\n97\n00:05:20.883 --> 00:05:22.582\nAnd granted there is no data in that file,\nbut\n\n98\n00:05:22.582 --> 00:05:24.388\nyou can think of it like a placeholder,\nright?\n\n99\n00:05:24.388 --> 00:05:28.602\nIt took and claimed all of that space,\n\n100\n00:05:28.602 --> 00:05:30.426\nright?\n&gt;&gt; Party of two.\n\n101\n00:05:30.426 --> 00:05:31.273\n&gt;&gt; Party of two.\n\n102\n00:05:31.273 --> 00:05:32.537\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's what it make me think\n\n103\n00:05:32.537 --> 00:05:34.814\nof, like I'm gonna go create\na reservation at a restaurant.\n\n104\n00:05:34.814 --> 00:05:35.425\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n105\n00:05:35.425 --> 00:05:36.117\n&gt;&gt; It's there.\n\n106\n00:05:36.117 --> 00:05:36.883\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely,\n\n107\n00:05:36.883 --> 00:05:38.803\nit definitely claimed that space.\n\n108\n00:05:38.803 --> 00:05:40.726\nSo that's a fixed drive.\n\n109\n00:05:40.726 --> 00:05:45.773\nIf we go back through the wizard,\nlet's go New &gt; Hard Disk.\n\n110\n00:05:45.773 --> 00:05:47.386\nAnd we'll skip through this first part.\n\n111\n00:05:47.386 --> 00:05:51.138\nI'm gonna Apples to Apples, another VHDX.\n\n112\n00:05:51.138 --> 00:05:55.257\nThis time I'm gonna do\ndynamically expanding, all right?\n\n113\n00:05:55.257 --> 00:06:02.321\nFor my type, I'll click Next,\nthen I'll call this one Dynamic01.\n\n114\n00:06:02.321 --> 00:06:09.041\nI'll put it in that same location,\nso we can find it later on.\n\n115\n00:06:11.328 --> 00:06:16.990\nAnd here I'm gonna do just again\napples to apples, 1 gigabyte.\n\n116\n00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:19.827\nI'll click Next and then Finish.\n\n117\n00:06:19.827 --> 00:06:23.883\nAnd I want you to see, remember,\nthe Fixed Drive took 15 seconds maybe.\n\n118\n00:06:26.132 --> 00:06:29.450\nI didn't even get a progress bar,\nit was just instantaneous, right?\n\n119\n00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:32.389\nBecause remember with dynamic,\nI'm not claiming the space,\n\n120\n00:06:32.389 --> 00:06:36.328\nI'm just creating a placeholder that says,\nhey, I'm gonna grow eventually, but\n\n121\n00:06:36.328 --> 00:06:38.229\nright now I'm not taking up much space.\n\n122\n00:06:38.229 --> 00:06:39.518\nLet's see.\n\n123\n00:06:39.518 --> 00:06:42.839\nSo the fixed was 1 gig in size.\n\n124\n00:06:42.839 --> 00:06:46.652\nNotice dynamic is only 4\nmegabytes in size, right?\n\n125\n00:06:46.652 --> 00:06:53.565\nIt can grow up to 1 gigabyte, but\nas of now it is only 4 megabytes in size.\n\n126\n00:06:53.565 --> 00:06:59.089\nAll right, so we've got a fixed disk and\nwe've got a dynamic disk.\n\n127\n00:06:59.089 --> 00:07:01.894\nLet's go back over to Hyper-V.\n\n128\n00:07:01.894 --> 00:07:05.624\nAnd let's take a look at\ncreating that third type,\n\n129\n00:07:05.624 --> 00:07:08.678\nwhich is gonna be our differencing disk.\n\n130\n00:07:08.678 --> 00:07:12.149\nI'm gonna go New, Hard Disk one more time.\n\n131\n00:07:12.149 --> 00:07:15.547\nNext on my wizard,\nwe're gonna do VHDX one more time.\n\n132\n00:07:15.547 --> 00:07:20.564\nNow, I'm gonna be choosing Differencing\ndown here at the bottom, right?\n\n133\n00:07:20.564 --> 00:07:23.349\nThat's probably something\nI didn't point out,\n\n134\n00:07:23.349 --> 00:07:27.524\nI wanna make sure you're aware of,\nthat last sentence on that paragraph,\n\n135\n00:07:27.524 --> 00:07:31.520\nall children must have the same virtual\nhard disk format as the parent.\n\n136\n00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:38.881\nIn other words, if my parent is using\na VHD, then the child needs to be a VHD.\n\n137\n00:07:38.881 --> 00:07:44.747\nI can't point a VHDX differencing\ndisk back to a .VHD parent disk.\n\n138\n00:07:44.747 --> 00:07:46.055\nSo they do have to be the same format,\n\n139\n00:07:46.055 --> 00:07:47.925\nbecause they gotta have the same features,\nright?\n\n140\n00:07:47.925 --> 00:07:55.141\nVHDX does things that VHDs can't do,\nso they do have to be the same.\n\n141\n00:07:55.141 --> 00:07:57.370\nI'll go ahead and click Next.\n\n142\n00:07:57.370 --> 00:07:59.191\nAnd, you never guess what\nwe're gonna call this one?\n\n143\n00:07:59.191 --> 00:08:01.148\n&gt;&gt; Differencing.\n\n144\n00:08:01.148 --> 00:08:04.222\n&gt;&gt; Differencing, if I spell that right 01.\n\n145\n00:08:04.222 --> 00:08:05.130\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n146\n00:08:05.130 --> 00:08:07.486\n&gt;&gt; Differencing I think I did, and\n\n147\n00:08:07.486 --> 00:08:10.110\nwe'll put it in the same location.\n\n148\n00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:13.900\nSo we can find that easier,\nand I'll click Next.\n\n149\n00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:17.680\nAnd now I get a different screen.\n\n150\n00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:22.750\nWe didn't have this screen when we\ncreated the fixed or the dynamic, right?\n\n151\n00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:24.842\nOnly differencing disks have parents,\nI will have to tell it.\n\n152\n00:08:24.842 --> 00:08:27.829\nWhere is that parent differencing virtual?\n\n153\n00:08:27.829 --> 00:08:31.250\nOr where's the parent for\nthe new differencing virtual hard drive.\n\n154\n00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:34.253\nSo, I'm gonna browse, and\nI'm gonna find a drive.\n\n155\n00:08:36.172 --> 00:08:40.493\nNow, this drive is a Server 2016 install,\n\n156\n00:08:40.493 --> 00:08:46.120\nthat I've created a VM and\nin fact, what, let's move that.\n\n157\n00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:48.010\nWell, we'll just do it here for now.\n\n158\n00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:51.780\nI created a Virtual Machine,\ninstalled Server 2016, and\n\n159\n00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:54.682\nthen I Sysprep it, and I shut it down.\n\n160\n00:08:54.682 --> 00:08:58.400\nRemember, Sysprepping is what we use\nto generalize the operating system,\n\n161\n00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:02.248\nremove any unique capabilities and\nget it ready for duplication.\n\n162\n00:09:02.248 --> 00:09:06.835\nSo, I sysprep it and shut it down, so\nthis is a 2016 install that's been\n\n163\n00:09:06.835 --> 00:09:09.470\nsysprepped.\n&gt;&gt; So we're basically just dealing with\n\n164\n00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:12.870\na big generic parent.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly right\n\n165\n00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:13.476\n&gt;&gt; Okay, [LAUGH]\n\n166\n00:09:13.476 --> 00:09:15.120\n&gt;&gt; So, I'm gonna select that one,\n\n167\n00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:17.996\nlet me zoom back out, so\nI can successfully navigate, and\n\n168\n00:09:17.996 --> 00:09:19.550\nI'll click Open, all right.\n\n169\n00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:24.108\nSo now, it knows where that parent\nhard drive is, I'll click Next, and\n\n170\n00:09:24.108 --> 00:09:25.545\nwe'll click Finish.\n\n171\n00:09:28.068 --> 00:09:32.630\nAnd now if we go back over to\nFile Explorer, I've got differencing01.\n\n172\n00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:36.675\nAgain, 4 MB in size,\nbecause the parent was dynamic.\n\n173\n00:09:36.675 --> 00:09:39.830\nFor sure it was time we,\nyeah, it was dynamic.\n\n174\n00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:44.600\nOr, I'm sorry VHDX,\nthe child was VHDX, and\n\n175\n00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:47.750\nit's only four megs in size,\nso it will grow as needed.\n\n176\n00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:50.810\nThe parent remember,\nwas ten gigs in size, if we go back and\n\n177\n00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:54.910\nlook at the parent drive for server 2016.\n\n178\n00:09:54.910 --> 00:09:59.219\nTo install 2016 with no updates,\n10 gigabytes in size or\n\n179\n00:09:59.219 --> 00:10:02.060\njust over 10 gigabytes there.\n\n180\n00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:07.780\nSo that's the wizard for\ncreating these new VHDs.\n\n181\n00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:12.520\nBut as we know with Microsoft, this is not\nthe only way we should be familiar with\n\n182\n00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:13.438\ncreating drives, right?\n&gt;&gt; No,\n\n183\n00:10:13.438 --> 00:10:15.399\n[LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, what else should we do, Cherokee?\n\n184\n00:10:15.399 --> 00:10:17.031\n&gt;&gt; I don't know Mike,\n\n185\n00:10:17.031 --> 00:10:22.155\nmaybe we should use a third party\ntool to go, and create those.\n\n186\n00:10:22.155 --> 00:10:23.081\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay, yeah,\n\n187\n00:10:23.081 --> 00:10:24.173\nshe's playing along.\n\n188\n00:10:24.173 --> 00:10:26.320\nYeah, we're gonna use PowerShell, right?\n&gt;&gt; Of\n\n189\n00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:27.350\ncourse, we are.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n190\n00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:28.267\nthat's right.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n191\n00:10:28.267 --> 00:10:30.102\n&gt;&gt; So if I've got PowerShell powered up,\n\n192\n00:10:30.102 --> 00:10:32.835\nI do wanna show you,\nI'll put this link in the show notes.\n\n193\n00:10:32.835 --> 00:10:37.019\nYou can go out to Microsoft, and you\ncan get all of the different PowerShell\n\n194\n00:10:37.019 --> 00:10:39.420\ncommands that you can work with Hyper-V.\n\n195\n00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:44.425\nAs you can see, it is quite extensive,\nand it's a pretty big module giving me\n\n196\n00:10:44.425 --> 00:10:49.760\naccess to all the features that I need for\nworking with Hyper-V from PowerShell.\n\n197\n00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:55.277\nOne of which is the command new-VHD,\nall right.\n\n198\n00:10:55.277 --> 00:11:00.150\nNew-VHD is how we're gonna create\na brand new virtual hard drive.\n\n199\n00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:01.570\nThere are, in fact, what,\n\n200\n00:11:01.570 --> 00:11:05.880\nlet's go back out for one second,\nI don't normally do this.\n\n201\n00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:10.990\nBut let's say New-VHD PowerShell, and\n\n202\n00:11:10.990 --> 00:11:14.120\nlet's take a look at Microsoft,\nsome of their syntax up here.\n\n203\n00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:20.031\nAll right, and I'll zoom in, so we can say\nthat just a little bit better, all right.\n\n204\n00:11:20.031 --> 00:11:23.933\nSo when it comes to new HD,\nwe've got a few different parameters,\n\n205\n00:11:23.933 --> 00:11:26.524\nonly certain ones\nare going to be required.\n\n206\n00:11:26.524 --> 00:11:30.718\nPath is gonna specify where\nI wanna create this VM,\n\n207\n00:11:30.718 --> 00:11:37.361\nif I'm creating a new VM SizeBytes is how\nbig that virtual machine is going to be.\n\n208\n00:11:37.361 --> 00:11:39.590\nYou can use the keyboard Dynamic.\n\n209\n00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:43.020\nI don't like the way that Microsoft did\ntheir syntax on this particular page.\n\n210\n00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:45.110\nRather than showing you\nthe three options for\n\n211\n00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:47.270\nthis, they give you\nthree different blocks.\n\n212\n00:11:47.270 --> 00:11:50.442\nOne of them says Fixed,\none of them says Dynamic.\n\n213\n00:11:50.442 --> 00:11:54.930\nIt is kind of confusing, but\nSizeBytes how big the drive is gonna be,\n\n214\n00:11:54.930 --> 00:11:56.100\nthat's gonna be required.\n\n215\n00:11:57.370 --> 00:11:59.421\nFixed dynamic or differencing,\n\n216\n00:11:59.421 --> 00:12:03.238\nit has to know what kind of drive\nyou're going to be creating.\n\n217\n00:12:03.238 --> 00:12:06.516\nWatch SizeBytes, LogicalSector,\nPhysicalSectorSizeBytes,\n\n218\n00:12:06.516 --> 00:12:08.040\nthose are not required.\n\n219\n00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:12.270\nTypically you don't need to modify those\nunless you're trying to align with some\n\n220\n00:12:12.270 --> 00:12:14.290\ndifferent underlying physical disk.\n\n221\n00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:19.850\nComputer name, if you're specifying name\nof the computer you're creating it on.\n\n222\n00:12:19.850 --> 00:12:20.630\nRest of those or\n\n223\n00:12:20.630 --> 00:12:24.310\nnone of those are going to be required.\n&gt;&gt; Now in an earlier show, Mike,\n\n224\n00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:27.660\nyou told us that VHD was just\nkinda the catch all term for\n\n225\n00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:30.020\nthose virtual hard disks or hard drives.\n\n226\n00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:32.560\nSo when you're creating\nthem in PowerShell and\n\n227\n00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:36.170\nyou're like I don't wanna create\na new VHD, I wanna create a new VHDX.\n\n228\n00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:39.370\nLooking at the actual file\nname is where we see that\n\n229\n00:12:39.370 --> 00:12:42.010\ndistinction?\n&gt;&gt; Yes, when you create, when you set\n\n230\n00:12:42.010 --> 00:12:45.530\nthe path you're gonna not only set\nthe path to where you're creating it.\n\n231\n00:12:45.530 --> 00:12:49.590\nBut you're also gonna set the name for\nthe VHD that you're creating.\n\n232\n00:12:49.590 --> 00:12:51.460\nAnd whatever extension you use.\n\n233\n00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:56.770\nIf it's test1.vhd it will create\na VHD hard drive, Virtual hard drive.\n\n234\n00:12:56.770 --> 00:13:00.348\nIf you use .VHDX it will create a .VHDX.\n\n235\n00:13:00.348 --> 00:13:04.280\nSo you're gonna specify, there's not\na separate parameter to say hey,\n\n236\n00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:06.690\nI wanna a VHD or hey I want a VHDX.\n\n237\n00:13:06.690 --> 00:13:10.201\nYou determine that by adding\nthat extension, all right.\n\n238\n00:13:10.201 --> 00:13:12.770\nThat's a great point Cherokee.\n\n239\n00:13:12.770 --> 00:13:18.004\nIf you use an absolute path,\ntypically that's what you'd wanna do,\n\n240\n00:13:18.004 --> 00:13:23.862\nlike I wanna make this drive on\nE:\\vm\\Virtual Hard Drive\\vhdo1.vhdx,\n\n241\n00:13:23.862 --> 00:13:27.428\nright or something like that,\nabsolute path.\n\n242\n00:13:27.428 --> 00:13:32.940\nIf you use a relative path, if you just\nsay the name for example, TEST01.VHDX,\n\n243\n00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:37.668\nit'll use, I'm sorry not whatever\ndirectory you're currently in,\n\n244\n00:13:37.668 --> 00:13:41.110\nit'll actually use your\ndefaults from Hyper-V.\n\n245\n00:13:41.110 --> 00:13:44.670\nAl right, remember I showed you how to\nin and change my default locations for\n\n246\n00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:45.680\nVM storage?\n\n247\n00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:49.138\nAnd VHG storage, it will use those.\n\n248\n00:13:49.138 --> 00:13:51.480\nI do wanna point out one more too,\n\n249\n00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:57.590\nif you do differencing as the type or\nremember when we went through the wizard.\n\n250\n00:13:57.590 --> 00:13:58.910\nIf I chose differencing,\n\n251\n00:13:58.910 --> 00:14:04.120\nI now had a second or additional screen\nthat says well where's the parent?\n\n252\n00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:08.680\nSame thing here, if you're creating\na differencing disk through PowerShell,\n\n253\n00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:11.660\nyou still have to tell it\nwhere is the parent VHD.\n\n254\n00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:16.780\nAnd that is -ParentPath in\norder to make that work, right?\n\n255\n00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:20.154\nSo that is some of the syntax for\nMicrosoft,\n\n256\n00:14:20.154 --> 00:14:22.455\nI'll throw those in the show notes for\nyou.\n\n257\n00:14:22.455 --> 00:14:27.300\nI have a pretty easy to Surge tech net,\nor Microsoft Docs I should say nowadays.\n\n258\n00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:29.470\nAnd find that information.\n\n259\n00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:31.930\nAll right, so\nlet's create a couple of VHDs.\n\n260\n00:14:31.930 --> 00:14:37.140\nLet's do the first one let's do Fixed,\nright?\n\n261\n00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:41.525\nSo I'll use my, let me zoom in so\nyou guys can see.\n\n262\n00:14:41.525 --> 00:14:42.450\n&gt;&gt; Super zoom [LAUGH]\n\n263\n00:14:42.450 --> 00:14:43.800\n&gt;&gt; That is super zoom,\n\n264\n00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:50.050\nlet's see if we can adjust that zoom,\nI don't know if I can or not.\n\n265\n00:14:50.050 --> 00:14:51.802\nOops, that's not what I wanted.\n\n266\n00:14:51.802 --> 00:14:54.778\nHopefully, you can see that,\nI'll zoom in again here and\n\n267\n00:14:54.778 --> 00:14:57.170\nkind of scroll around as I'm typing.\n\n268\n00:14:57.170 --> 00:15:02.730\nSo, new-VHD, my type is going to be Fixed,\nand if I just try\n\n269\n00:15:02.730 --> 00:15:06.900\nto hit Enter right now, it says eh, no.\n&gt;&gt; Missed a few things.\n\n270\n00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:08.960\n&gt;&gt; Not going to work, right?\n\n271\n00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:12.889\nSays, parameter set\ncannot be resolved using\n\n272\n00:15:12.889 --> 00:15:17.231\nthe specified name\nparameters New-VHD -Fixed.\n\n273\n00:15:17.231 --> 00:15:21.640\nAnd that's because I did\nnot give it a path, right?\n\n274\n00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:25.800\nIt doesn't know what to call it,\nor where to put it.\n\n275\n00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:31.651\nSo let's add a -Path attribute,\nand let's just say test01.\n\n276\n00:15:31.651 --> 00:15:38.355\nThis time, I'm not gonna put an absolute\npath, test01.vhdx, and I'll hit Enter now.\n\n277\n00:15:38.355 --> 00:15:43.342\nAnd still is unable to create that guy,\n\n278\n00:15:43.342 --> 00:15:50.030\nwhich is interesting.\n&gt;&gt; What about our size, Mike?\n\n279\n00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:51.782\nDo we have to specify that originally, or\n\n280\n00:15:51.782 --> 00:15:55.154\nis that something we can work around?\n&gt;&gt; I kind of wanted to show you that it\n\n281\n00:15:55.154 --> 00:15:59.250\nwould prompt me for the size, that it\nwould actually throw that up there, but\n\n282\n00:15:59.250 --> 00:16:01.032\ninstead it is just erroring out.\n\n283\n00:16:01.032 --> 00:16:06.220\nWhich is interesting, so\nI will try to do this again.\n\n284\n00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:11.110\nWe'll say a new hdx- SizeBytes.\n\n285\n00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:18.180\nAnd let's say we wanna do,\nLet's do 100 megabyte.\n\n286\n00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:22.164\nYou can use mb and gb,\nyou do not have to go, all right,\n\n287\n00:16:22.164 --> 00:16:27.290\nI wanna make a 10 gigabyte drive,\nso that's how many bytes is that?\n\n288\n00:16:27.290 --> 00:16:31.210\nYou don't have to worry about that,\nyou can use the abbreviations in here.\n\n289\n00:16:31.210 --> 00:16:33.120\nSo I'm gonna say, 100mb, all right?\n\n290\n00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:38.540\nAnd there it goes, it created it.\n\n291\n00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:39.600\nThat really is odd.\n\n292\n00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:41.840\nI did that on purpose,\nthe first two errors.\n\n293\n00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:42.572\n&gt;&gt; I wonder if,\n\n294\n00:16:42.572 --> 00:16:46.250\ndid you practice in the server,\non the server operating system?\n\n295\n00:16:46.250 --> 00:16:49.400\nBecause, maybe it was\n&gt;&gt; I was in the same VM,\n\n296\n00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:50.711\nso that's interesting why-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay.\n\n297\n00:16:50.711 --> 00:16:51.707\n&gt;&gt; It's giving me the error.\n\n298\n00:16:51.707 --> 00:16:55.437\nNormally, what would happen if its\na required parameter, It prompts me and\n\n299\n00:16:55.437 --> 00:16:57.760\nit says, please input the size in bytes.\n\n300\n00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:01.010\nAnd you just type it in, if you forgot\nthat parameter, I wanted to show you that.\n\n301\n00:17:01.010 --> 00:17:05.280\nBut Windows said no, make sure you teach\nthem how to provide all the parameters in\n\n302\n00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:06.710\nthe first place.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] They should have known that,\n\n303\n00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:11.260\nMike, they're not gonna remind you.\n&gt;&gt; Don't rely on the Wizard prompting you\n\n304\n00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:12.980\nfor missing parameters.\n\n305\n00:17:12.980 --> 00:17:13.700\nSo there you go.\nSo\n\n306\n00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:19.050\nin the end three parameters are really\nall that's required to create that disk.\n\n307\n00:17:19.050 --> 00:17:21.620\nI mean there are more\nparameters that I can use.\n\n308\n00:17:21.620 --> 00:17:26.270\nBut at the bare minimum, type,\nfixed dynamic differencing,\n\n309\n00:17:26.270 --> 00:17:30.980\npath, absolute or relative,\nand then size and bytes.\n\n310\n00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:35.650\nIf it's differencing, one more\nrequired parameter, you're gonna need\n\n311\n00:17:35.650 --> 00:17:40.070\nthat path parent, parent path,\nsorry,-parent path.\n\n312\n00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:43.170\nSo there's my fix, and\nit shouldn't look any different except for\n\n313\n00:17:43.170 --> 00:17:45.960\nwhere it's located will be different,\nright?\n\n314\n00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:50.170\nBecause we were creating them in\nhere when I was using the Wizard.\n\n315\n00:17:50.170 --> 00:17:52.500\nBut this time I used a relative path.\n\n316\n00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:57.100\nSo it should've gone to my default,\nwhich I thought I set to equal in VMs.\n\n317\n00:17:57.100 --> 00:18:00.670\nMaybe I did not,\ncuz I do not see it in there.\n\n318\n00:18:00.670 --> 00:18:04.020\nLet's see.\n&gt;&gt; For which one?\n\n319\n00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:05.580\nYou might wanna check the-\n&gt;&gt; You know what?\n\n320\n00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:07.320\n&gt;&gt; Default location, yeah, because-\n\n321\n00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:10.270\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, what it's supposed to do\n\n322\n00:18:10.270 --> 00:18:14.590\nis use my default from the Hyper-V\nconsole, which we changed.\n\n323\n00:18:14.590 --> 00:18:17.020\nWhat it ended up doing was using-\n&gt;&gt; Putting it in their default.\n\n324\n00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:19.110\n&gt;&gt; My path that I'm currently in in my\n\n325\n00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:19.860\nshell.\n\n326\n00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:24.110\nSo I did not change directories first and\nthat's where it ended up creating it.\n\n327\n00:18:24.110 --> 00:18:27.420\nSo that's a little bit interesting,\nthat's not the way it's supposed to work.\n\n328\n00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:29.352\nShame, shame, shame.\n\n329\n00:18:29.352 --> 00:18:31.970\nAll right, but anyway,\nlet's create another one real quick and\n\n330\n00:18:31.970 --> 00:18:33.530\nI'll fix that path.\n\n331\n00:18:33.530 --> 00:18:37.870\nSo we can go find it, rather than dig\nthrough System32 and look for it.\n\n332\n00:18:37.870 --> 00:18:41.410\nSo let's say e:\\,\nI think I called it, what, test?\n\n333\n00:18:43.690 --> 00:18:44.680\nDid I call it test?\n\n334\n00:18:46.410 --> 00:18:48.302\nI called it VMs, sorry.\n\n335\n00:18:50.814 --> 00:18:57.288\nWe'll say VMs/test.1hdx.\n\n336\n00:18:57.288 --> 00:18:58.840\nWe're gonna do that one more time.\n\n337\n00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:02.310\nAnd again it creates it this\ntime using the path I specified.\n\n338\n00:19:02.310 --> 00:19:04.120\nHave a look in file explorer.\n\n339\n00:19:05.590 --> 00:19:07.270\nI swear sometimes my brain does not work.\n\n340\n00:19:07.270 --> 00:19:12.180\nI created it in VMs instead of VHDs but\nwhat are you gonna do?\n\n341\n00:19:12.180 --> 00:19:18.120\nThere it is, it is about 100 megabytes\nin size, and it is of the fixed variety.\n\n342\n00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:19.620\nMeaning it went ahead and claimed, right?\n\n343\n00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:22.700\n100 megabytes in space.\n\n344\n00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:27.900\nLet me move that over here.\n&gt;&gt; You\n\n345\n00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:31.900\ncan't have it unorganized, can you Mike?\n&gt;&gt; It's going to drive me crazy, yes.\n\n346\n00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:35.400\nAnd I wanted to do some comparisons,\nright, to these as well.\n\n347\n00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:42.600\nSo there's my fixed, we only made it a\nhundred megabytes instead of one gigabyte.\n\n348\n00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:47.430\nLet's go back over to Powershell, and\nlet's say I wanted to make a dynamic disk.\n\n349\n00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:48.653\n[INAUDIBLE] how do we do that?\n\n350\n00:19:48.653 --> 00:19:54.161\nEasy, new -vhd -dynamic, right?\n\n351\n00:19:54.161 --> 00:20:01.570\nAnd then the same thing,\n-path e:\\ this time we'll do vhds.\n\n352\n00:20:01.570 --> 00:20:08.636\nAnd we'll say test02.vhdx and\n\n353\n00:20:08.636 --> 00:20:13.271\nSizeBytes 100mb.\n\n354\n00:20:13.271 --> 00:20:14.210\nSo, Cherokee,\n\n355\n00:20:14.210 --> 00:20:18.090\nhow big do you expect this VHD to be?\n&gt;&gt; Ooh, I don't know.\n\n356\n00:20:18.090 --> 00:20:22.530\nWith our dynamic,\nmaybe like what's the smallest,\n\n357\n00:20:22.530 --> 00:20:23.260\nthat you think?\n&gt;&gt; Four\n\n358\n00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:24.260\nmegabytes.\n&gt;&gt; Four's\n\n359\n00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:25.020\nthe smallest?\n&gt;&gt; Yup.\n\n360\n00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:25.520\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n361\n00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:26.150\n&gt;&gt; That's it.\n\n362\n00:20:26.150 --> 00:20:27.260\n&gt;&gt; Then that's what I expect.\n\n363\n00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:28.060\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n364\n00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:29.880\nagain it creates it, right?\n\n365\n00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:32.490\nI can see that I put it in that location.\n\n366\n00:20:32.490 --> 00:20:33.820\nYou take a look at file explorer.\n\n367\n00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:39.910\nTest 02 is indeed four megabytes in size,\nall right?\n\n368\n00:20:39.910 --> 00:20:42.984\nSo, using the same parameters,\nsize in bytes is 100 megabytes,\n\n369\n00:20:42.984 --> 00:20:45.690\nyou can see the difference again\nbetween fixed and dynamic.\n\n370\n00:20:45.690 --> 00:20:48.950\nWhich I think you guys probably\ngot the concept down pat.\n\n371\n00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:50.510\nAll right,\n\n372\n00:20:50.510 --> 00:20:55.570\nwhat if I want to make a differencing\ndisk from Powershell, can we do it?\n\n373\n00:20:55.570 --> 00:20:58.100\nI don't know, let's find out.\n\n374\n00:20:58.100 --> 00:21:02.818\nNow we're going to do new-VHD\n-differencing this time, and\n\n375\n00:21:02.818 --> 00:21:05.763\nwe'll keep everything else the same.\n\n376\n00:21:05.763 --> 00:21:12.011\nSo -path is going to be e: /VHDs.\n\n377\n00:21:12.011 --> 00:21:19.093\nAnd we'll call this one testo3.VHDX\n\n378\n00:21:19.093 --> 00:21:24.033\n-size invites 100MB.\n\n379\n00:21:24.033 --> 00:21:27.350\nAnd I can hit enter now.\n&gt;&gt; So, here's the thing,\n\n380\n00:21:27.350 --> 00:21:30.040\nwhen we specify that pair\nwe need to do that here.\n\n381\n00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:32.740\nAnd I've actually, you know how you said,\nhey look if you want to create.\n\n382\n00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:36.520\nWhen we were talking about having the VHD,\n\n383\n00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:40.370\nhaving the formats the same for\nthe parent and the child.\n\n384\n00:21:40.370 --> 00:21:45.270\nSo personally, if just a mistake,\nI forgot or mistyped and\n\n385\n00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:48.940\nput VHD, if I omitted the X, and\n\n386\n00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:50.410\nit will balk at you here.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.\n\n387\n00:21:50.410 --> 00:21:51.842\n&gt;&gt; So we really have to make sure we're\n\n388\n00:21:51.842 --> 00:21:54.260\npaying attention.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, you do, you must.\n\n389\n00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:57.796\nIn fact if I hit enter,\nyou guys know this is gonna fail, right.\n\n390\n00:21:57.796 --> 00:22:00.725\nNow it wants to prompt me for\nthe missing parameters.\n\n391\n00:22:00.725 --> 00:22:01.390\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] There you go, Ike.\n\n392\n00:22:01.390 --> 00:22:02.490\n&gt;&gt; Like it normally does.\n\n393\n00:22:02.490 --> 00:22:04.650\nSo there's an example\nof PowerShell saying,\n\n394\n00:22:04.650 --> 00:22:06.880\nhey you left out a required parameter.\n\n395\n00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:09.620\nDifferencing is gonna\nrequire a different path and\n\n396\n00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:11.650\nI can just input the information here.\n\n397\n00:22:11.650 --> 00:22:13.550\nI don't want to.\n\n398\n00:22:13.550 --> 00:22:16.290\nI'm gonna Esc or\nI'm gonna Ctrl+C out of that.\n\n399\n00:22:16.290 --> 00:22:20.560\nAnd type that one more time and\nshow you the proper way of doing it.\n\n400\n00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:24.830\nSo ParentPath, and\nthen wherever the parent hard drive is.\n\n401\n00:22:24.830 --> 00:22:26.750\nWhich gosh, now I've gotta remember.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n402\n00:22:26.750 --> 00:22:32.585\n&gt;&gt; E:/VMs/WindowsServer2016,\n\n403\n00:22:32.585 --> 00:22:40.368\nWindowsSever2016, let's make this bigger.\n\n404\n00:22:40.368 --> 00:22:45.670\n\\virtual hard disks\\,\nwhat is that drive called?\n\n405\n00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:51.040\nMy memory was almost there.\n&gt;&gt; I know and I was like, I hope you're\n\n406\n00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:53.700\nnot counting on me to remember for you.\n&gt;&gt; WS2016.vhdx,\n\n407\n00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:57.145\nthat was easy enough.\n&gt;&gt; Good.\n\n408\n00:22:57.145 --> 00:22:58.940\n&gt;&gt; Ws2016.vhdx\n\n409\n00:22:58.940 --> 00:23:00.385\n&gt;&gt; So now, same command, right?\n\n410\n00:23:00.385 --> 00:23:04.080\nNew-VHD, Differencing, Path, SizeBytes.\n\n411\n00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:09.540\nBut we've added ParentPath, and I've\ntold it where to find that parent drive.\n\n412\n00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:10.474\nI hit Enter.\n\n413\n00:23:12.250 --> 00:23:18.560\nWhoops, let me give a little focus,\nand I hit, why did you do that?\n\n414\n00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:20.090\nI misclicked there a little bit.\n\n415\n00:23:20.090 --> 00:23:28.336\nWe'll say ParentPath again,\ne:\\ws\\ms2016\\ws2016,\n\n416\n00:23:28.336 --> 00:23:33.380\nVirtual Hard Disks\\ws2016.vhdx.\n\n417\n00:23:33.380 --> 00:23:35.618\nAnd I hit Enter.\n\n418\n00:23:38.570 --> 00:23:41.150\nAnd it's gonna verify\nthat it can find that.\n\n419\n00:23:42.230 --> 00:23:43.633\nFail to create.\n\n420\n00:23:43.633 --> 00:23:49.981\n[INAUDIBLE] is corrupt\n[INAUDIBLE] differencing disk.\n\n421\n00:23:49.981 --> 00:23:57.690\nSo it doesn't like my teenie tiny 100\nmegabyte drive that I'm creating.\n\n422\n00:23:57.690 --> 00:24:00.583\nVHDX is correct.\n\n423\n00:24:00.583 --> 00:24:02.842\nAnd it is a VHDX.\n\n424\n00:24:02.842 --> 00:24:07.583\nSo it's not the mismatch in the virtual\ndevice size of the parent virtual\n\n425\n00:24:07.583 --> 00:24:10.081\nhard disk and the differencing disk.\n\n426\n00:24:13.071 --> 00:24:15.095\nYeah, it definitely\ndoesn't like that size.\n\n427\n00:24:15.095 --> 00:24:20.530\nI wanna say my well,\nI'm not even gonna try to guess.\n\n428\n00:24:20.530 --> 00:24:21.611\nLet's make it a little bigger.\n\n429\n00:24:23.750 --> 00:24:27.200\nLet's make this 1 gigabyte in size and\nsee if it'll let me.\n\n430\n00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:37.830\nWell, that's interesting.\n&gt;&gt; How big was the parent?\n\n431\n00:24:37.830 --> 00:24:40.154\n&gt;&gt; It's about 10 gigabytes in size.\n\n432\n00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:44.469\nBut it's definitely not\nliking something there.\n\n433\n00:24:44.469 --> 00:24:48.063\nI'm not sure what,\nfailed to create the virtual hard disk,\n\n434\n00:24:48.063 --> 00:24:53.078\nthe system failed to create test 03, the\nchain of virtual hard disk is corrupted.\n\n435\n00:24:53.078 --> 00:24:57.047\nThere's a mismatch in the virtual sizes\nof the parent virtual hard disk and\n\n436\n00:24:57.047 --> 00:24:58.370\nthe differencing disk.\n\n437\n00:25:01.148 --> 00:25:03.800\nNo, that's not it.\n\n438\n00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:08.510\nInteresting, not sure why\nI'm getting that error.\n\n439\n00:25:08.510 --> 00:25:11.770\nI'm gonna have to do a little\nmore research on that one.\n\n440\n00:25:11.770 --> 00:25:13.452\nIt's not liking me creating that,\nyou saw me create it through that,\n\n441\n00:25:13.452 --> 00:25:14.549\nyou saw me creating that\nthrough the wizard.\n\n442\n00:25:14.549 --> 00:25:17.141\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it looks like how I would do it,\n\n443\n00:25:17.141 --> 00:25:18.213\nyep.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\n\n444\n00:25:18.213 --> 00:25:22.094\nit worked through the wizard,\nnow working through here.\n\n445\n00:25:22.094 --> 00:25:24.362\nWait, you know what?\n\n446\n00:25:24.362 --> 00:25:26.944\nDid I do that?\n\n447\n00:25:26.944 --> 00:25:28.994\nI am silly.\n&gt;&gt; What?\n\n448\n00:25:28.994 --> 00:25:30.263\n&gt;&gt; All right, so.\n\n449\n00:25:30.263 --> 00:25:30.803\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n450\n00:25:30.803 --> 00:25:32.320\n&gt;&gt; Let's test it and\n\n451\n00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:37.490\nmake sure I figured out where\nmy error was in the first place.\n\n452\n00:25:37.490 --> 00:25:40.760\nWell, it's gonna have to be, let's just\nsee if it'll prompt me for the size, and\n\n453\n00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:42.460\nthen I can figure out\nwhat the mismatch is.\n\n454\n00:25:45.075 --> 00:25:46.286\nThere we go.\n\n455\n00:25:46.286 --> 00:25:51.318\nI got to thinking about it,\nI'm creating a differencing disk and\n\n456\n00:25:51.318 --> 00:25:54.715\nyou're not gonna specify the size on that.\n\n457\n00:25:54.715 --> 00:25:58.036\nBecause it's just gonna be\nas small as possible and\n\n458\n00:25:58.036 --> 00:26:00.500\nthen it's gonna grow as needed.\n\n459\n00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:02.324\nSo I don't need that size and\n\n460\n00:26:02.324 --> 00:26:03.939\nbytes parameter,\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n461\n00:26:03.939 --> 00:26:05.170\n&gt;&gt; When I'm creating that\n\n462\n00:26:05.170 --> 00:26:06.343\ndifferencing there.\n\n463\n00:26:06.343 --> 00:26:07.333\nSo that was just a little\nbrain cramp on my part there.\n\n464\n00:26:07.333 --> 00:26:08.364\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah,\n\n465\n00:26:08.364 --> 00:26:09.424\nokay.\n&gt;&gt; I wasn't thinking.\n\n466\n00:26:09.424 --> 00:26:10.071\n&gt;&gt; That's great though to remind us about\n\n467\n00:26:10.071 --> 00:26:10.828\nthat.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah it is,\n\n468\n00:26:10.828 --> 00:26:12.235\nyeah I meant to do that..\n\n469\n00:26:12.235 --> 00:26:13.526\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n470\n00:26:13.526 --> 00:26:14.147\nThat's what I meant to do, sure.\n\n471\n00:26:14.147 --> 00:26:18.936\nBut there you go, I created\na differencing disk from PowerShell,\n\n472\n00:26:18.936 --> 00:26:20.910\nagain leave off that size.\n\n473\n00:26:20.910 --> 00:26:22.496\nLet's go see what size it created.\n\n474\n00:26:22.496 --> 00:26:29.760\nIf we go back out to File Explorer,\ntest03, again 4 megabytes in size.\n\n475\n00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:34.294\nSo it wasn't letting me specify a\nparticular size, this is like we're gonna\n\n476\n00:26:34.294 --> 00:26:38.200\nmake dynamic, cuz the differencing\ndisk is going to be dynamic and\n\n477\n00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:40.580\nI don't have any choice in that.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n478\n00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:42.918\n&gt;&gt; It's going to grow as necessary so\n\n479\n00:26:42.918 --> 00:26:46.858\nI can't specify that fixed size like that.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, Mike,\n\n480\n00:26:46.858 --> 00:26:49.598\nwe've looked at quite a bit in this show.\n\n481\n00:26:49.598 --> 00:26:52.047\nYou showed us how to create Fixed,\nDynamic, and\n\n482\n00:26:52.047 --> 00:26:54.440\nDifferencing in both the GUI and\nPowerShell.\n\n483\n00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:57.337\nAnything else for this show?\n&gt;&gt; I don't think so.\n\n484\n00:26:57.337 --> 00:26:59.374\nI think we're good there.\n\n485\n00:26:59.374 --> 00:27:02.183\nAs you said, pretty much covered\nall the different ways that we\n\n486\n00:27:02.183 --> 00:27:05.310\ncan create these VHDs through the GUI,\nthrough PowerShell.\n\n487\n00:27:05.310 --> 00:27:08.596\nWe need to create some virtual machines,\nand start using those VHDs, but\n\n488\n00:27:08.596 --> 00:27:11.404\nwe'll save that for the next one.\n&gt;&gt; All right, Mike, sounds like a plan.\n\n489\n00:27:11.404 --> 00:27:14.969\nThank you for being with us, and thank\nyou for being with us as well, but for\n\n490\n00:27:14.969 --> 00:27:16.270\nnow let's sign out.\n\n491\n00:27:16.270 --> 00:27:18.294\nI've been your host, Cherokee Boose.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n492\n00:27:18.294 --> 00:27:20.908\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n493\n00:27:20.908 --> 00:27:26.461\n[MUSIC]\n\n494\n00:27:26.461 --> 00:27:28.952\n&gt;&gt; Thank

00:00:08.335\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.335 --> 00:00:11.841\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.841 --> 00:00:16.170\n&gt;&gt; Welcome everyone to your Configuring\nWindows Devices series studying for\n\n6\n00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:17.414\nthat 70-697.\n\n7\n00:00:17.414 --> 00:00:19.376\nI'm your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n8\n00:00:19.376 --> 00:00:22.412\nIn this episode we'll be\ncoming back with a Part 4,\n\n9\n00:00:22.412 --> 00:00:24.694\ncontinuing to take a look at Hyper-V.\n\n10\n00:00:24.694 --> 00:00:28.533\nAnd of course with us today in\nstudios we have Mr. Mike Rodrick.\n\n11\n00:00:28.533 --> 00:00:29.456\nHow's it going, Mike?\n\n12\n00:00:29.456 --> 00:00:30.344\n&gt;&gt; It's going great, Cherokee.\n\n13\n00:00:30.344 --> 00:00:31.068\nThanks for having me back.\n\n14\n00:00:31.068 --> 00:00:34.527\nExcited as always to be here\ntalking to everybody out there.\n\n15\n00:00:34.527 --> 00:00:37.708\nAnd always excited to be talking about\nHyper-V, one of my favorite topics.\n\n16\n00:00:37.708 --> 00:00:39.380\nOf course, I say that about everything.\n\n17\n00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:40.042\n&gt;&gt; You do.\n\n18\n00:00:40.042 --> 00:00:41.191\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n19\n00:00:41.191 --> 00:00:42.736\n&gt;&gt; I like them all, I like them all.\n\n20\n00:00:42.736 --> 00:00:46.413\nWe're gonna take a look at Hyper-V and\nif you've missed the previous episodes,\n\n21\n00:00:46.413 --> 00:00:48.917\nwe've already talked a lot\nabout virtual hard drives,\n\n22\n00:00:48.917 --> 00:00:51.544\nwhich are a component obviously\nof our virtual machines.\n\n23\n00:00:51.544 --> 00:00:55.360\nThis is the hard drive where they\nstore their operating system files and\n\n24\n00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.168\nall your data, so\nwe've looked at creating those.\n\n25\n00:00:58.168 --> 00:01:00.501\nSo our next really is to?\n\n26\n00:01:00.501 --> 00:01:02.696\n&gt;&gt; We'll have a machine to\nattach those hard drives to.\n\n27\n00:01:02.696 --> 00:01:05.338\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, we wanna make\nsome virtual machines, right?\n\n28\n00:01:05.338 --> 00:01:09.589\nSo that's what we're going to focus on\nnext and then after we get through this,\n\n29\n00:01:09.589 --> 00:01:11.376\nwe'll move on into networking.\n\n30\n00:01:11.376 --> 00:01:13.427\nBecause once you've got\nthese virtual machines,\n\n31\n00:01:13.427 --> 00:01:16.056\nwhat good do they do you if they\ncan't talk to each other, right?\n\n32\n00:01:16.056 --> 00:01:17.623\nYou can't talk to them,\nand that kind of thing.\n\n33\n00:01:17.623 --> 00:01:23.031\nSo that's our roadmap as we go\nthrough the next few episodes here.\n\n34\n00:01:23.031 --> 00:01:27.214\nSo Cherokee, let's start out, I thought,\nwe've looked at some hard drives,\n\n35\n00:01:27.214 --> 00:01:30.845\nwe've created some virtual hard drives,\ndifferent types, Fixed,\n\n36\n00:01:30.845 --> 00:01:32.155\nDynamic Differencing.\n\n37\n00:01:32.155 --> 00:01:33.509\nWe've talked about virtual machines.\n\n38\n00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:34.744\nWe haven't actually seen one, have we?\n\n39\n00:01:34.744 --> 00:01:39.196\n&gt;&gt; Right, and I know you did show us\nlike the actual virtual machine manager,\n\n40\n00:01:39.196 --> 00:01:42.951\nwe have a glimpse of that but\nwe didn't really dive in too much.\n\n41\n00:01:42.951 --> 00:01:43.694\n&gt;&gt; We didn't, did we?\n\n42\n00:01:43.694 --> 00:01:46.550\nSo let's start there and\nthen we'll create some virtual machines.\n\n43\n00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:48.790\nSo join me here on my screen.\n\n44\n00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:53.000\nAnd I've got my Hyper-V Manager opened\nup and just in case you forgot, right?\n\n45\n00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.741\nThat's cool little icon right down there,\neyes are good old Hyper-V Manager.\n\n46\n00:01:57.741 --> 00:01:59.689\nI'm gonna launch that up again,\n\n47\n00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:04.435\nmake sure I've still Selected by a Hyper-V\nserver that I wanna manage, right?\n\n48\n00:02:04.435 --> 00:02:06.211\nRemember we're doing\nthis on a Windows 10 box.\n\n49\n00:02:06.211 --> 00:02:10.252\nWe are studying for the 70-697 exam.\n\n50\n00:02:10.252 --> 00:02:11.784\nSo I'm on my Windows 10 machine.\n\n51\n00:02:11.784 --> 00:02:13.607\nWe've got Hyper-V opened up.\n\n52\n00:02:13.607 --> 00:02:16.644\nAnd you can see I've got a couple of\nvirtual machines that I set up for\n\n53\n00:02:16.644 --> 00:02:18.945\nus ahead of time so\nwe'd have something to look at.\n\n54\n00:02:18.945 --> 00:02:22.079\nAnd I'm simply gonna select one here.\n\n55\n00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:27.984\nAnd there's many different ways as always\nwith Microsoft that I can start this up.\n\n56\n00:02:27.984 --> 00:02:31.649\nMy personal favorite,\nI'll just double-click on it and\n\n57\n00:02:31.649 --> 00:02:34.879\nit opens up my connection\nto that virtual machine.\n\n58\n00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:37.997\nBut you notice again, the virtual\nmachine isn't running, all right?\n\n59\n00:02:37.997 --> 00:02:43.290\nSo this my, almost like an RDP\nconnection into that virtual machine.\n\n60\n00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.854\nI could start it by clicking on that\nStart button right there in the middle of\n\n61\n00:02:47.854 --> 00:02:48.659\nthe screen.\n\n62\n00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:52.187\nI can also go to my Action menu and\nchoose Start, but\n\n63\n00:02:52.187 --> 00:02:55.645\nI don't have to connect to it to start it,\nright?\n\n64\n00:02:55.645 --> 00:02:58.420\nI can start it from right here,\nI can right click on it.\n\n65\n00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.446\nAnd I can choose Start or I can come down\nhere to my Actions pane, and you'll see\n\n66\n00:03:02.446 --> 00:03:06.488\ndown here at the bottom right, right\nhere behind me, I'll great job Taylor.\n\n67\n00:03:06.488 --> 00:03:08.786\nAnd I can see Start right there.\n\n68\n00:03:08.786 --> 00:03:12.130\nAnd remember, see,\nit says Svr01 right above that?\n\n69\n00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:16.658\nWhatever you have selected are what\nthose actions are going to apply to.\n\n70\n00:03:16.658 --> 00:03:20.443\nNow, it says Svr02 and\nI could start that one there.\n\n71\n00:03:20.443 --> 00:03:23.235\n&gt;&gt; In some way it's cool,\nthey give us a lot of options but\n\n72\n00:03:23.235 --> 00:03:26.955\nI remember starting out thinking okay\nwell, which one should I choose?\n\n73\n00:03:26.955 --> 00:03:30.944\nAnd especially when it came to\npowering off or shutting down, and\n\n74\n00:03:30.944 --> 00:03:33.129\nthen like what's the difference?\n\n75\n00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:34.166\nCan you explain that a little bit?\n\n76\n00:03:34.166 --> 00:03:36.039\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, let's get one fired up.\n\n77\n00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:38.794\nAnd then we'll take a look at how\nwe're gonna shut it down properly.\n\n78\n00:03:38.794 --> 00:03:40.640\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; It's a great point.\n\n79\n00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:45.224\nAll right, so and one of the reasons I'm\nshowing you this different method is this\n\n80\n00:03:45.224 --> 00:03:49.355\nis one of the big differences between\na type one and a type two hypervisor.\n\n81\n00:03:49.355 --> 00:03:51.776\nWith type two where you're\nrunning an application, right?\n\n82\n00:03:51.776 --> 00:03:54.531\nYou've installed Oracle's VirtualBox or\n\n83\n00:03:54.531 --> 00:03:57.740\nsomething like that on\nyour Windows 10 machine.\n\n84\n00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:00.248\nYou build a virtual machine and\nyou run it.\n\n85\n00:04:00.248 --> 00:04:04.172\nBut when you close VirtualBox\nthe machine closes as well.\n\n86\n00:04:04.172 --> 00:04:07.855\nIt'll prompt you to see if you wanna\nsave state or shut it down or whatever.\n\n87\n00:04:07.855 --> 00:04:11.570\nBut if the application is running then\nthe virtual machine isn't running.\n\n88\n00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:14.631\nThis is just like Office,\nlike Excel, or Word.\n\n89\n00:04:14.631 --> 00:04:16.760\nWhen you close Word, Word is gone.\n\n90\n00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.751\nWith a type one,\nremember it's a little different here.\n\n91\n00:04:19.751 --> 00:04:23.513\nNow, we've slipped our hypervisor\nunderneath our operating system,\n\n92\n00:04:23.513 --> 00:04:26.731\nand things are running more like\na service in the background.\n\n93\n00:04:26.731 --> 00:04:29.925\nSo I can start one of these machines\nup without ever connecting to it.\n\n94\n00:04:29.925 --> 00:04:34.082\nIt's still gonna run, it's gonna have\nwhatever access we've given it to as far\n\n95\n00:04:34.082 --> 00:04:35.986\nas networking and things like that.\n\n96\n00:04:35.986 --> 00:04:39.596\nI can still connect to it remotely\nacross the network if I've set that up,\n\n97\n00:04:39.596 --> 00:04:42.172\neven though the window is\nnot opened up on my screen.\n\n98\n00:04:42.172 --> 00:04:44.085\nI can close the Hyper-V Manager and\n\n99\n00:04:44.085 --> 00:04:47.161\nthe virtual machine is still\nrunning in the background.\n\n100\n00:04:47.161 --> 00:04:50.087\nSo it's a big difference\nbetween type one and type two.\n\n101\n00:04:50.087 --> 00:04:53.774\nSo my preferred method like I said,\nI'm usually starting up a machine and\n\n102\n00:04:53.774 --> 00:04:54.912\nI wanna connect to it.\n\n103\n00:04:54.912 --> 00:04:57.757\nThe reason I'm starting it up\nis because I wanna get into it.\n\n104\n00:04:57.757 --> 00:05:01.848\nSo I'll typically just double click on it,\ncuz I know that opens up my connection\n\n105\n00:05:01.848 --> 00:05:04.627\nwindow, and\nI can then just start it from right there.\n\n106\n00:05:04.627 --> 00:05:08.176\nBut if you start it first,\nand then connect to it,\n\n107\n00:05:08.176 --> 00:05:10.211\nthat will work just as well.\n\n108\n00:05:10.211 --> 00:05:12.963\nYou know what?\nI don't even know what this server is,\n\n109\n00:05:12.963 --> 00:05:16.597\nit looks like it might be\nthe first time I'm firing this up.\n\n110\n00:05:16.597 --> 00:05:20.257\nNow, you have to forgive me, the\nresolution on here is gonna be a little\n\n111\n00:05:20.257 --> 00:05:23.124\nwonky, because I'm inside\nthis virtual machine, and\n\n112\n00:05:23.124 --> 00:05:27.343\nyou've got another remote desktop or\nvirtual machine connection here running.\n\n113\n00:05:27.343 --> 00:05:30.961\nSo I can't really make it go full\nscreen and look all that pretty.\n\n114\n00:05:30.961 --> 00:05:32.537\nI think it's gonna letterbox on me.\n\n115\n00:05:32.537 --> 00:05:34.964\n[COUGH] But this is a server, right?\n\n116\n00:05:34.964 --> 00:05:37.884\nAnd as it's booting up,\nit's in the middle of the boot process,\n\n117\n00:05:37.884 --> 00:05:39.313\nI'm gonna close the window.\n\n118\n00:05:39.313 --> 00:05:40.755\nMy gosh, you just killed it, right?\n\n119\n00:05:40.755 --> 00:05:43.148\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No, not with the type one.\n\n120\n00:05:43.148 --> 00:05:46.991\nYou can look down here in the bottom,\nand I can see information about it,\n\n121\n00:05:46.991 --> 00:05:48.130\nwhen it was created.\n\n122\n00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:51.060\nThis is a little thumbnail of\nthe actual virtual machine, so\n\n123\n00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:53.018\nit's still kinda in that black screen.\n\n124\n00:05:53.018 --> 00:05:56.012\nThis doesn't update quite as quickly.\n\n125\n00:05:56.012 --> 00:05:57.379\n&gt;&gt; Not 100% real time?\n\n126\n00:05:57.379 --> 00:05:59.457\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nthere's a little bit of a lag there.\n\n127\n00:05:59.457 --> 00:06:02.828\nBut eventually I'll see the log\non screen pop up there.\n\n128\n00:06:02.828 --> 00:06:05.870\nYou get a little information\nlike Heartbeat: OK.\n\n129\n00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:10.583\nThis is a signal that my virtual machine\nmanager Hyper-V console is talking to that\n\n130\n00:06:10.583 --> 00:06:15.497\nvirtual machine, seeing it's responding,\nlittle heart beat signal to let it know,\n\n131\n00:06:15.497 --> 00:06:19.164\nhey, it's up, it's running,\nwhat it's current status is.\n\n132\n00:06:19.164 --> 00:06:22.180\nWe also have some memory\ninformation down here.\n\n133\n00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:24.920\nI can see how much start up\nmemory is assigned to it.\n\n134\n00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:28.178\nThese are things we're gonna talk\nabout as we look at building VMs,\n\n135\n00:06:28.178 --> 00:06:29.615\nhow much memory is assigned.\n\n136\n00:06:29.615 --> 00:06:33.217\nWhat it's currently demanding memory-wise,\n\n137\n00:06:33.217 --> 00:06:37.001\nit's only using 450 MB\nof memory at this point.\n\n138\n00:06:37.001 --> 00:06:40.322\nAnd then I've got my networking tab, which\nisn't gonna show us a whole lot because\n\n139\n00:06:40.322 --> 00:06:42.331\nI haven't really networked\nthese machines yet.\n\n140\n00:06:42.331 --> 00:06:45.146\nWe are gonna learn about\nthat in just a little bit.\n\n141\n00:06:45.146 --> 00:06:46.737\nSo I'll zoom back out.\n\n142\n00:06:46.737 --> 00:06:49.546\nAnother way, just one more way\nyou can connect to your VM.\n\n143\n00:06:49.546 --> 00:06:52.960\nIs you can double-click on that\nlittle thumbnail down there.\n\n144\n00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:56.547\nI say that and now it's not doing it,\nand there it goes.\n\n145\n00:06:56.547 --> 00:06:59.171\nAnd you can connect to\nit that way as well.\n\n146\n00:06:59.171 --> 00:07:02.347\nNow, this little dialogue that\npops up here, this is for\n\n147\n00:07:02.347 --> 00:07:04.334\nthe virtual machine connection and\n\n148\n00:07:04.334 --> 00:07:08.653\nit's wanting to know what size I wanna\nmake the window when I connect to that.\n\n149\n00:07:08.653 --> 00:07:13.359\nTypically I'll tell you I'll go Full\nScreen and if I will try that in here,\n\n150\n00:07:13.359 --> 00:07:17.255\njust see how it looks on my screen,\nand I could click Connect.\n\n151\n00:07:17.255 --> 00:07:18.822\nYou go to Show Options.\n\n152\n00:07:20.413 --> 00:07:21.783\nAnd let me, there you go.\n\n153\n00:07:21.783 --> 00:07:25.375\nYou can Save my settings for\nfuture connections to this machine.\n\n154\n00:07:25.375 --> 00:07:28.886\nSo if I choose to go Full Screen and\nI check Save my settings,\n\n155\n00:07:28.886 --> 00:07:31.710\nthe next time I connect to it,\nit won't ask me.\n\n156\n00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:33.041\nI kinda like it to ask me.\n\n157\n00:07:33.041 --> 00:07:35.210\nSometimes I want it full screen,\nsometimes I don't.\n\n158\n00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:36.615\nAnd it's not like a permanent thing.\n\n159\n00:07:36.615 --> 00:07:41.166\nYou can always still change\nyour connection, all right?\n\n160\n00:07:41.166 --> 00:07:44.997\nSo I'll go ahead and\nconnect to that, zoom back out.\n\n161\n00:07:44.997 --> 00:07:47.923\nAnd again, it might still be in\nthe middle of the boot process.\n\n162\n00:07:47.923 --> 00:07:48.921\nThere it goes.\n\n163\n00:07:50.895 --> 00:07:54.734\nIt's a little tired this morning I\ngot to give it a chance to wake up.\n\n164\n00:07:54.734 --> 00:07:57.692\nAnd it looks like I might\nhave click Connect twice, so\n\n165\n00:07:57.692 --> 00:08:00.142\nI'm gonna close one of those connections.\n\n166\n00:08:00.142 --> 00:08:03.339\nAnd connect full screen again.\n\n167\n00:08:03.339 --> 00:08:05.300\nSometimes I can get a little\nhappy with that mouse.\n\n168\n00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:05.920\n&gt;&gt; It happens.\n\n169\n00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:09.810\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, all right, so we'll give that\na chance to connect, but this is a VM.\n\n170\n00:08:09.810 --> 00:08:14.230\nSo, what you're seeing is a virtual\nmachine that has a separate\n\n171\n00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:18.140\noperating system installed on it,\nI can run applications in here.\n\n172\n00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:22.960\nWe can do tests in the dev environment,\nor if wanna study for an exam,\n\n173\n00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:26.630\nfor example, and I wanna play around\nwith some of those server features, but\n\n174\n00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:28.750\nI don't have a server laying around.\n\n175\n00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:32.840\nI could use this to-\n&gt;&gt; And it's crazy,\n\n176\n00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:35.600\nit's not a physical machine.\n\n177\n00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:37.870\nIt's probably not so\ncrazy to a lot of people,\n\n178\n00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:43.240\nbut virtualization has been around for\na long time, but it really wasn't\n\n179\n00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:47.595\nmainstream until, I don't want to say\nrecently, but it's been like 10 years.\n\n180\n00:08:47.595 --> 00:08:48.570\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, it's been a little while.\n\n181\n00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:50.395\nBut it's definitely-\n&gt;&gt; It's been a while.\n\n182\n00:08:50.395 --> 00:08:51.830\n&gt;&gt; - Come a long way.\n\n183\n00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:56.310\nIt's definitely more in the reach,\nwell now that it's built into Windows 10.\n\n184\n00:08:56.310 --> 00:09:02.250\nThis was something that a few years\nhad to go purchase a Hypervisor or\n\n185\n00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:05.230\ntry to get a copy of\nHyper-V from Microsoft.\n\n186\n00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:07.910\nBut now it's part of my clients license.\n\n187\n00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:09.540\n&gt;&gt; And\nyou just treat it like a real machine.\n\n188\n00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:14.200\nI mean you still gotta keep it secure,\nand have some kind of anti\n\n189\n00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:18.190\nmalware software running on it and just\ntreat it like you would a regular machine.\n\n190\n00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:19.840\n&gt;&gt; It's a full blown machine.\n\n191\n00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:22.670\nI'm gonna close this connection,\nit seems to be having an issue.\n\n192\n00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:24.719\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n&gt;&gt; So I can see it's coming up.\n\n193\n00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:28.275\nBecause I launched that\nconnection window twice, I think,\n\n194\n00:09:28.275 --> 00:09:29.919\nit was having a little bit of a fit there.\n\n195\n00:09:29.919 --> 00:09:34.720\nSo let me try to connect to that one\nmore time, will go full screen again,\n\n196\n00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:37.949\nand again not the best\nperformance on my laptop,\n\n197\n00:09:37.949 --> 00:09:40.832\nthis a brand new machine\nthat I just built.\n\n198\n00:09:40.832 --> 00:09:45.440\nKeep getting Not Responding so I won't\ntouch it, I'll give it a second and\n\n199\n00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:49.660\nlet it do its thing here,\nmaybe so, give that just a second.\n\n200\n00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:53.580\nSo what we're going to look at is\ncreating new virtual machines today.\n\n201\n00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:54.765\nI did want to show you one.\n\n202\n00:09:54.765 --> 00:09:57.030\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Seems to be going a little slow,\n\n203\n00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:59.150\nwe'll work on that here in just a minute.\n\n204\n00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:01.150\nBut we want to look at the different\nways that we can go about\n\n205\n00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:02.720\ncreating a virtual machine.\n\n206\n00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:05.890\nAnd by far the easiest way is\ngoing to be to use the Wizard\n\n207\n00:10:05.890 --> 00:10:08.560\nthat's included in that\nHyper-V Management Console.\n\n208\n00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:12.970\nCouple things to keep in mind,\nyou will need installation media right.\n\n209\n00:10:12.970 --> 00:10:19.210\nJust because we're running Hyper-V doesn't\nmean I can spin up a 2016 server or\n\n210\n00:10:19.210 --> 00:10:23.280\na Windows 10 machine,\nI still need the install media.\n\n211\n00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:27.510\nI would need to either have that or obtain\na trial, it's the easiest way to do it,\n\n212\n00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:32.810\nsomehow obtain that media and\nlicensing is still in play.\n\n213\n00:10:32.810 --> 00:10:35.500\nYou know, I use trial versions for\neverything I do,\n\n214\n00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:39.480\nbecause like with Windows 10,\nyou get 90 days on the trial version.\n\n215\n00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:43.090\nThree months, that's plenty of time\nto do any testing I need to do.\n\n216\n00:10:43.090 --> 00:10:46.900\nFor the trial version,\nthe 2016 Server, then you get 180 days\n\n217\n00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:47.690\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's a lot longer.\n\n218\n00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:51.030\n&gt;&gt; You know, six months,\nplenty of time to spin up some servers.\n\n219\n00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:53.750\nI can use them for six months,\ndo whatever I wanna do.\n\n220\n00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:59.610\nAnd honestly, after a few months the\nmachines are so messed up from me testing\n\n221\n00:10:59.610 --> 00:11:05.540\nand playing and goofing that it's time to\nblow them away and start all over anyway.\n\n222\n00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:07.200\nSo I love using the trial versions.\n\n223\n00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:10.296\nHere's my logon screen finally so\nwe can take a look at that.\n\n224\n00:11:10.296 --> 00:11:11.440\nAnd let me login.\n\n225\n00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:13.290\n&gt;&gt; And so I can see that bar at the top,\n\n226\n00:11:13.290 --> 00:11:16.600\nit looks very similar to what we would\nsee with a Remote Desktop Connection, so\n\n227\n00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:21.140\nthat kinda helps clue as in on hey,\nthis isn't a native desktop.\n\n228\n00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:24.896\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, it does let you know like,\nhey,this is, your on something remote,\n\n229\n00:11:24.896 --> 00:11:27.324\nright, this is that virtual\nmachine connection.\n\n230\n00:11:27.324 --> 00:11:32.327\nSo here's my 2016 box, I think I\nonly gave it like 2 GB of ram, which\n\n231\n00:11:32.327 --> 00:11:37.838\nis probably why it's running a little bit\nslow, but it is a full blown machine.\n\n232\n00:11:37.838 --> 00:11:44.542\nIf I restore down, here's the Windows, so\nunderneath, there's my Windows 10 machine.\n\n233\n00:11:44.542 --> 00:11:50.199\nI'm gonna minimize Hyper-V,\nthere's my Windows 10 desktop, but\n\n234\n00:11:50.199 --> 00:11:56.340\non this desktop I now have another\nwindow with Server 2016 running in it.\n\n235\n00:11:56.340 --> 00:11:59.700\nYou can see Server Manager popping up,\n\n236\n00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:03.360\nit can get a little confusing trying\nto keep track of the Windows.\n\n237\n00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:09.160\nSo this is my virtual machine,\nbehind that is my Windows 10 desktop.\n\n238\n00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:10.620\nNow, cool thing, yeah, go ahead.\n\n239\n00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:13.330\n&gt;&gt; No, I was just gonna say when\nyou're saying the confusing part,\n\n240\n00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:16.790\nI know one thing that kind of,\nand I guess not aggravates me but\n\n241\n00:12:16.790 --> 00:12:21.130\nit's kind of a little bit aggravating,\nis your mouse.\n\n242\n00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:23.470\nSometimes those commands\nare getting stuck in the screen and\n\n243\n00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:27.100\nwhen you were saying running through\nan installation or whatever, and\n\n244\n00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:32.430\nwe were looking at doing the installation\nprocess, the Alt key flipping through.\n\n245\n00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:35.060\nSometimes your keyboard shortcuts don't\n\n246\n00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:38.510\nmake it all the way into that virtual\nmachine, so just kinda be aware of that.\n\n247\n00:12:38.510 --> 00:12:43.400\nAnd what is it that might be different,\nbut Ctrl+Alt to release.\n\n248\n00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:46.620\nLike if the virtual machine kind\nof holds your mouse hostage,\n\n249\n00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:51.300\nif you wanna have it released, then\nCtrl+Alt to get your mouse cursor back.\n\n250\n00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:52.000\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and\n\n251\n00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.940\nwe'll talk a little bit more about that\nwhen we get into Integration Services.\n\n252\n00:12:55.940 --> 00:12:56.900\n&gt;&gt; Nice, okay cool.\n\n253\n00:12:56.900 --> 00:13:00.870\n&gt;&gt; But what she's referring to is I'm\ninside the virtual machine here, clicking,\n\n254\n00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:06.650\nmoving things around, so my mouse\nsignal is being directed to the VM.\n\n255\n00:13:06.650 --> 00:13:10.010\nBut notice that I can go\nright outside of the VM, and\n\n256\n00:13:10.010 --> 00:13:14.580\nnow I'm on my physical machine and\nmy mouse strokes are recognized by that.\n\n257\n00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:15.830\nAnd that's what she's talking about.\n\n258\n00:13:15.830 --> 00:13:18.880\nSometimes you will see where you\ngo to move the mouse outside of\n\n259\n00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:22.680\nthe virtual machine and it bumps up\nagainst the wall and it can't get out.\n\n260\n00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:27.000\nIt's been captured by the VM, and\nif the VM doesn't have the right services\n\n261\n00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.190\nrunning, you have to do a keyboard\nshortcut to release that mouse and\n\n262\n00:13:30.190 --> 00:13:34.100\ngive it back to the host machine and\nthe keyboard.\n\n263\n00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:36.300\nSame way with the keyboard exactly.\n\n264\n00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:40.190\nAll right, so let me full screen this so\nwe can get a better look at Server 2016.\n\n265\n00:13:40.190 --> 00:13:46.850\nSo, again, this is my VM, everything's\nworking just like it was a physical\n\n266\n00:13:46.850 --> 00:13:52.240\nserver, maybe a little bit slower\ndepending on what your resources are like.\n\n267\n00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:56.480\nAll right, now Cherokee talked\nabout shutting it down.\n\n268\n00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:59.180\nThe best way to shut down\na virtual machine is,\n\n269\n00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:02.160\nwell actually before I do that\nlet me do one more thing.\n\n270\n00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:04.160\nI'm gonna restore down and\n\n271\n00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:07.770\nthen I'm just gonna close that\nvirtual machine connection.\n\n272\n00:14:07.770 --> 00:14:09.420\nSo I'm back to my Windows 10 desktop,\n\n273\n00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:13.600\nI'm gonna open up the Hyper-V console and\nI'm gonna close that as well.\n\n274\n00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:17.650\nSo everything is gone,\nthis isn't a Type 2,\n\n275\n00:14:17.650 --> 00:14:20.830\na type one that virtual machine is\nstill running in the background,\n\n276\n00:14:20.830 --> 00:14:24.540\nit's still consuming resources but\nit's still running.\n\n277\n00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:28.450\nSo this was a server that was\nproviding a service to the network,\n\n278\n00:14:28.450 --> 00:14:29.560\nthey could still access it.\n\n279\n00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:33.280\nJust because my window isn't open doesn't\nmean that the virtual machine has shut\n\n280\n00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:35.820\ndown again, that's that Type 1 Hypervisor.\n\n281\n00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:39.170\n&gt;&gt; Have you ever shut your host down or\nclosed the lid accidentally and\n\n282\n00:14:39.170 --> 00:14:40.070\nforgot about them that way?\n\n283\n00:14:40.070 --> 00:14:42.150\n&gt;&gt; Yes absolutely, and\n\n284\n00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:47.700\nthankfully with the VHDX format it's not\nas bad as far as corrupting anything.\n\n285\n00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:51.760\nWhat Windows will do is it will go and\n\n286\n00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:53.740\nbasically hibernate all\nthose virtual machines.\n\n287\n00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:58.140\nThere's actually different options you\ncan choose to do what happens if the host\n\n288\n00:14:58.140 --> 00:15:00.060\npower fails or gets shut down.\n\n289\n00:15:00.060 --> 00:15:01.060\nWhat do I do with running VMs?\n\n290\n00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:03.640\nAnd we'll take a look at\nthose settings as well, but\n\n291\n00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:04.990\nyeah I've definitely done that before.\n\n292\n00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:09.430\nOkay, so you can see it's still running.\n\n293\n00:15:09.430 --> 00:15:12.980\nIf I double click on it,\nI'm just gonna connect right back to it.\n\n294\n00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:18.570\nI was gonna leave the default size right\nthere and notice I can log back in and\n\n295\n00:15:18.570 --> 00:15:24.080\neverything is still going even though I\nhad temporarily closed that connection.\n\n296\n00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:27.403\nSo as far as shutting this down,\nthe best way to shut down a VM\n\n297\n00:15:27.403 --> 00:15:32.120\nis to simply use the shut down method\nthrough the operating system itself.\n\n298\n00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:37.730\nThis is my server01 VM,\nI should go to the start menu,\n\n299\n00:15:37.730 --> 00:15:41.040\nhit that power button and\nchoose Shut Down.\n\n300\n00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:45.159\nIt's a normal shut down process just for\nlike any other operating system.\n\n301\n00:15:45.159 --> 00:15:50.068\nThat is the best way to do it, but\nif I'm not connected to that machine and\n\n302\n00:15:50.068 --> 00:15:53.127\ndo I want to connect to it\njust to shut it down or\n\n303\n00:15:53.127 --> 00:15:56.124\ncan I shut it down\nwithout connecting to it?\n\n304\n00:15:56.124 --> 00:15:58.594\nAnd the answer would be yes,\nbut you do have some choices.\n\n305\n00:15:58.594 --> 00:16:03.634\nIf we look over here I can see turn off,\nshut down, save,\n\n306\n00:16:03.634 --> 00:16:08.375\npause, reset, checkpoint and\na few other options.\n\n307\n00:16:08.375 --> 00:16:10.910\nLet's focus on these guys right here.\n\n308\n00:16:10.910 --> 00:16:15.230\nSave is kinda like a saved state,\na temporary pause that machine and\n\n309\n00:16:15.230 --> 00:16:16.730\nsave its state.\n\n310\n00:16:16.730 --> 00:16:20.772\nYou also have pause, which will pause it\nand you'll see it looks like a video that\n\n311\n00:16:20.772 --> 00:16:25.130\nyou've paused where everything freezes and\nget paused just right in the middle of it.\n\n312\n00:16:25.130 --> 00:16:28.282\nBut these two here, turn off or shutdown,\nthese are the ones that confuse people.\n\n313\n00:16:28.282 --> 00:16:31.160\nAnd it's important we understand\nthe difference between the two.\n\n314\n00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:35.615\nShut down will send a shut down\ncommand to the operating system.\n\n315\n00:16:35.615 --> 00:16:39.860\nSo it should be just like going to\nthe operating system, the start menu and\n\n316\n00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:41.240\nchoosing to shut down.\n\n317\n00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:45.194\nWhat we call a graceful shut down,\neverything knows that the power's going\n\n318\n00:16:45.194 --> 00:16:48.961\naway, it gives everything a chance\nto write anything final to the disk,\n\n319\n00:16:48.961 --> 00:16:53.260\nclose applications, turn off services,\nand shut Windows down properly.\n\n320\n00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:56.900\nSo this would be just like shutting it\ndown through the operating system, so\n\n321\n00:16:56.900 --> 00:16:58.640\nthis would be the preferred method.\n\n322\n00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:02.576\nTurn off is like pulling the power, right,\nit's like taking the power cord and\n\n323\n00:17:02.576 --> 00:17:04.360\njust yanking it out of the machine.\n\n324\n00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:08.546\nIt's gonna instantly shut off,\nbut just like a physical machine,\n\n325\n00:17:08.546 --> 00:17:10.340\nthat's not the best idea.\n\n326\n00:17:10.340 --> 00:17:14.591\nThat can cause problems,\nit can cause data corruption, data loss,\n\n327\n00:17:14.591 --> 00:17:16.286\ncause all kinds of issues.\n\n328\n00:17:16.286 --> 00:17:19.177\nIf it's a test machine, and\nI've got to go catch my cab, and\n\n329\n00:17:19.177 --> 00:17:22.405\nI need to get out of here quick,\nmaybe I do just turn it off.\n\n330\n00:17:22.405 --> 00:17:26.515\nBut nine times out of ten you're gonna\nwant to shut that machine down properly.\n\n331\n00:17:26.515 --> 00:17:28.625\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nI met a lady at a store one time and\n\n332\n00:17:28.625 --> 00:17:31.129\nshe was talking me about a problem she\nhad in her computer, imagine that,\n\n333\n00:17:31.129 --> 00:17:33.172\na conversation that goes to computers\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n334\n00:17:33.172 --> 00:17:35.059\n&gt;&gt; And [LAUGH] she said, you know,\n\n335\n00:17:35.059 --> 00:17:39.705\nwhenever I unplug it, and she used it\nin the context of shutting it down, but\n\n336\n00:17:39.705 --> 00:17:42.480\nI'm like what do you\nmean when you unplug it?\n\n337\n00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:44.220\nShe goes when you're done and\nyou just unplug it.\n\n338\n00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:46.431\nI'm like, no, who told you that?\n\n339\n00:17:46.431 --> 00:17:49.670\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That was her normal method for\n\n340\n00:17:49.670 --> 00:17:51.026\nturning off her PC wow.\n\n341\n00:17:51.026 --> 00:17:53.621\nYou see all kinds of things\nout there don't you?\n\n342\n00:17:53.621 --> 00:17:57.412\n&gt;&gt; I felt so bad for her yeah,\nI told her about ITProTV.\n\n343\n00:17:57.412 --> 00:17:58.880\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right so\n\n344\n00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:02.230\nI'm gonna go ahead and shut that one\ndown using that shut down command And\n\n345\n00:18:02.230 --> 00:18:04.710\nwhat you'll see is it starts\ngoing through the process.\n\n346\n00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:06.490\nI can see over here, shutting down.\n\n347\n00:18:06.490 --> 00:18:10.450\nBut it's not an instant thing,\nit's doing a normal shut down process.\n\n348\n00:18:10.450 --> 00:18:12.900\nIf we watched the thumbnail,\noops I was a little bit too late.\n\n349\n00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:17.552\nWe would have seen it navigate through\nthe shut down screen and things like that.\n\n350\n00:18:17.552 --> 00:18:21.060\nAnd then I've got a little merge going on,\nwe'll talk about that in a little bit.\n\n351\n00:18:22.490 --> 00:18:24.700\nAll right, so\nCherokee it is time to build,\n\n352\n00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:27.680\nnow we've seen a VM,\nlet's create one shall we?\n\n353\n00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:28.900\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n354\n00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:32.850\nSo in order to create it, I've got\na couple things I've set up ahead of time.\n\n355\n00:18:32.850 --> 00:18:35.950\nActually one, and\nthat is my install media, right?\n\n356\n00:18:35.950 --> 00:18:41.410\nHere I have a copy of my\nEvaluation Edition Server 2016 that I\n\n357\n00:18:41.410 --> 00:18:43.260\ndownloaded from MIcrosoft.\n\n358\n00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:46.500\nSo that's really all I\nneed other than resources.\n\n359\n00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:50.320\nI need free disk space to create\nthe VM on, and I need memory and\n\n360\n00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:52.480\nprocessor that I can assign to that.\n\n361\n00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:55.120\nMy laptop has enough, so\nwe should be good to go.\n\n362\n00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:59.460\nSo over here in the Actions pane,\nwe are gonna click on New.\n\n363\n00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:02.680\nAnd then I have a choice,\nVirtual Machine, Hard Disk, Floppy Disk.\n\n364\n00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:06.152\nYes, you can still make floppy disks and\nit is quite fun.\n\n365\n00:19:06.152 --> 00:19:08.030\nI'm gonna click virtual machine.\n\n366\n00:19:08.030 --> 00:19:09.635\n&gt;&gt; One of those statements\nwas a lie [LAUGH].\n\n367\n00:19:09.635 --> 00:19:12.350\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I was trying to\nthink of what I needed.\n\n368\n00:19:12.350 --> 00:19:18.670\nI was trying to install Windows 98 in\na virtual machine just for flashbacks.\n\n369\n00:19:18.670 --> 00:19:21.540\nAnd of course I have\nall the Windows I need.\n\n370\n00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:22.530\n&gt;&gt; Floppy disks?\n&gt;&gt; Floppy disks.\n\n371\n00:19:22.530 --> 00:19:23.508\n&gt;&gt; My gosh.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n372\n00:19:23.508 --> 00:19:24.220\nAnd so.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n373\n00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:25.490\n&gt;&gt; It was fun to try to create that.\n\n374\n00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:29.490\nAll right, so before you begin,\nstart screen for\n\n375\n00:19:29.490 --> 00:19:33.260\nour little wizard tells me a little bit\nabout what we're getting ready to do.\n\n376\n00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:34.760\nMake sure you read that.\n\n377\n00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:36.840\nI'm gonna skip it, and here we go.\n\n378\n00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:40.390\nWe're gonna start by giving\nour virtual machine a name.\n\n379\n00:19:40.390 --> 00:19:42.750\nI got several servers over there,\nso I'm gonna call this one,\n\n380\n00:19:42.750 --> 00:19:46.985\nserver I should use something\na little more descriptive, right?\n\n381\n00:19:46.985 --> 00:19:50.089\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna say FirstVM.\n\n382\n00:19:50.089 --> 00:19:50.613\nThere we go,\n\n383\n00:19:50.613 --> 00:19:54.230\nthat way we can keep track of all these\nvirtual machines I'm gonna create.\n\n384\n00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:56.560\nI can store the virtual machine\nin a different location,\n\n385\n00:19:56.560 --> 00:20:01.490\nremember we set the default\nlocation to E:\\VMs.\n\n386\n00:20:01.490 --> 00:20:05.380\nSo if I wanna just leave it there and\nthat's perfect I'll just leave it.\n\n387\n00:20:05.380 --> 00:20:08.151\nOr I can choose to store it\nin a different location, and\n\n388\n00:20:08.151 --> 00:20:10.450\nthis will give me a chance to browse.\n\n389\n00:20:10.450 --> 00:20:11.660\nNow, I flip back and\n\n390\n00:20:11.660 --> 00:20:15.060\nforth, personally this is just some,\nthis is just organization.\n\n391\n00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:20.356\nYou might wanna go and say, all right,\ninside VMs I wanna create a new folder and\n\n392\n00:20:20.356 --> 00:20:23.613\nI'm gonna have to zoom out so\nthat I can see that.\n\n393\n00:20:23.613 --> 00:20:28.367\nNew folder and I'm gonna call it FirstVM,\n\n394\n00:20:28.367 --> 00:20:32.470\nright, and we'll select that guy.\n\n395\n00:20:32.470 --> 00:20:36.090\nI'll select folder, and\nit just modifies my path to include that.\n\n396\n00:20:36.090 --> 00:20:39.210\nSo if you like to kinda organize\nyour things a little bit better,\n\n397\n00:20:39.210 --> 00:20:41.540\nyou can certainly do so.\n\n398\n00:20:41.540 --> 00:20:45.760\nI'll click Next, and\nthen generation 1 or generation 2?\n\n399\n00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:48.983\nI'm gonna go with generation 2 so\nI can take advantage of all the latest and\n\n400\n00:20:48.983 --> 00:20:51.300\ngreatest features, we'll click next.\n\n401\n00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:54.700\nNow we have to assign memory\nto the Virtual Machine.\n\n402\n00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:56.180\nAgain, this is where we\nhave to start planning,\n\n403\n00:20:56.180 --> 00:20:59.430\nhow many machines do I plan\non spinning up at one time?\n\n404\n00:20:59.430 --> 00:21:02.270\nHow much memory does my\nsystem have all together so\n\n405\n00:21:02.270 --> 00:21:06.240\nI can decide how much to dole\nout to these other VM's.\n\n406\n00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:12.521\nI am going to go with 4096,\nif I hit my Num Lock.\n\n407\n00:21:12.521 --> 00:21:17.050\nAll right, and\nI can also use Dynamic Memory.\n\n408\n00:21:17.050 --> 00:21:21.900\nWe'll talk a little bit more about Dynamic\nMemory once we get a few VMs built and\n\n409\n00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:23.190\nwe look at the settings available.\n\n410\n00:21:23.190 --> 00:21:27.200\nI'm gonna uncheck that for now, actually\nI'll leave it checked, what the heck.\n\n411\n00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:29.000\nAnd we'll click Next.\n\n412\n00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:30.971\nI'm not gonna connect it to a network,\n\n413\n00:21:30.971 --> 00:21:34.034\nwe're gonna talk about networking\nin an upcoming episode.\n\n414\n00:21:34.034 --> 00:21:37.490\nSo we'll just leave it, I don't need\nany network access at this point, and\n\n415\n00:21:37.490 --> 00:21:39.130\nI'll click Next again.\n\n416\n00:21:39.130 --> 00:21:42.410\nAnd then here we get to\nmy hard disk screen.\n\n417\n00:21:42.410 --> 00:21:43.900\nI've got three choices here.\n\n418\n00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:49.080\nI can either create a virtual hard\ndisk right now for this VM to use.\n\n419\n00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:53.050\nOr I can use an existing\nvirtual hard disk.\n\n420\n00:21:53.050 --> 00:21:55.556\nRemember in the other episode,\nwe went through our wizard,\n\n421\n00:21:55.556 --> 00:21:57.581\nwe created a few different\ntypes of hard drives.\n\n422\n00:21:57.581 --> 00:22:02.220\nAnd if I had already created my VHD, I\ncould just browse and select it from here.\n\n423\n00:22:03.540 --> 00:22:06.710\nOr I can choose to attach\na virtual hard disk later.\n\n424\n00:22:06.710 --> 00:22:12.190\nAgain, maybe I plan on making one\nusing the virtual hard drive wizard.\n\n425\n00:22:12.190 --> 00:22:16.650\nBut I haven't done it yet, so I'm going to\ngo ahead and create the virtual machine,\n\n426\n00:22:16.650 --> 00:22:20.040\nthen I'll create the hard drive,\nthen I'll attach it to the VM.\n\n427\n00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:21.520\nIt's like the chicken and the egg thing.\n\n428\n00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:22.410\n&gt;&gt; Which comes first?\n\n429\n00:22:22.410 --> 00:22:23.550\n&gt;&gt; It doesn't matter, right?\n\n430\n00:22:23.550 --> 00:22:26.820\nWe don't have any way of knowing which\ncame first, the chicken or the egg, the VM\n\n431\n00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:31.740\nor the hard drive, but in the end I get my\nchicken and scrambled eggs, so I'm happy.\n\n432\n00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:33.800\nWe get our VM that works.\n\n433\n00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:39.180\nNow, the reason I might choose\nto create one after the fact or\n\n434\n00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:43.470\ncreate one ahead of time,\nis because of this first option up here.\n\n435\n00:22:43.470 --> 00:22:47.250\nCreate a Virtual Disk,\nuse this option to create a VHDX,\n\n436\n00:22:47.250 --> 00:22:50.490\ndynamically expanding virtual hard disk.\n\n437\n00:22:50.490 --> 00:22:52.970\nWell, what if I didn't want a VHDX,\nwhat if I wanted a VHD.\n\n438\n00:22:54.340 --> 00:22:57.170\nI can't do that here right\nit's not giving me a choice.\n\n439\n00:22:57.170 --> 00:23:01.110\nWhat if I wanted a fixed drive and\nnot a dynamically expanded disc,\n\n440\n00:23:01.110 --> 00:23:03.880\nI can't do that with this wizard\nit's not giving me the choice.\n\n441\n00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:08.520\nSo if you want to use a fixed drive you're\ngoing to create that ahead of time or\n\n442\n00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:11.740\ncreate it after the fact, you can't\ncreate it while you're creating the VM.\n\n443\n00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:16.610\nThe only option you have Is\na dynamically expanding VHDX, or\n\n444\n00:23:16.610 --> 00:23:19.820\nto have something already created,\nor to create it later.\n\n445\n00:23:19.820 --> 00:23:21.940\nI'll go ahead and\njust leave it on the default here though.\n\n446\n00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:25.280\nWe'll create a dynamically expanding VHDX.\n\n447\n00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:28.850\nI can set that maximum size,\nremember, with dynamically expanding,\n\n448\n00:23:28.850 --> 00:23:31.580\nit's not gonna start out at 127 gigabytes.\n\n449\n00:23:31.580 --> 00:23:35.900\nI don't need 127 gigabytes of free disk\nspace because it's going to be 4 megs in\n\n450\n00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:41.892\nsize until we start adding data to it and\nit starts to grow.\n\n451\n00:23:41.892 --> 00:23:45.651\nAll right, we'll click next and\nnow my operating system.\n\n452\n00:23:45.651 --> 00:23:48.494\nDo I want to install\nan operating system later,\n\n453\n00:23:48.494 --> 00:23:52.048\ninstall an operating system\nfrom a bootable image file, or\n\n454\n00:23:52.048 --> 00:23:56.328\ninstall an operating system from\nnetwork based installation server.\n\n455\n00:23:56.328 --> 00:24:00.410\nSo you've got WDS set up on your\nnetwork and you do PXE booting and\n\n456\n00:24:00.410 --> 00:24:04.630\nnetwork installs,\ndeploying your operating system that way.\n\n457\n00:24:04.630 --> 00:24:07.894\nYou can make you virtual machine\nPXE boot to the network,\n\n458\n00:24:07.894 --> 00:24:12.589\nassuming you've set everything properly\nand pull an image down to your WDS server\n\n459\n00:24:12.589 --> 00:24:16.620\njust like any physical machine on\nyou network, which is really cool.\n\n460\n00:24:16.620 --> 00:24:20.638\nIf you spend a lot of time getting\nimages ready and things like that,\n\n461\n00:24:20.638 --> 00:24:24.514\nyou need to spin up a new 2016 server or\na new Windows 10 box,\n\n462\n00:24:24.514 --> 00:24:26.650\nand you can just pull an image down.\n\n463\n00:24:26.650 --> 00:24:30.240\nI'll go ahead and grab my disk, if you\nchoose to install an operating system\n\n464\n00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:34.790\nlater it's gonna create a blank drive,\nit's gonna create your VM, it'll start off\n\n465\n00:24:34.790 --> 00:24:38.900\nshutdown, and if you try to boot it up\nit's gonna be just like you went and\n\n466\n00:24:38.900 --> 00:24:41.450\nbought a bare metal machine or\nyou just built it yourself.\n\n467\n00:24:41.450 --> 00:24:42.580\nAnd it has a blank hard drive.\n\n468\n00:24:42.580 --> 00:24:45.050\nYou boot it up and\nit says no operating system found, and\n\n469\n00:24:45.050 --> 00:24:46.860\nyou just get the blinking cursor there.\n\n470\n00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:51.070\nBut I can choose to install it later.\n\n471\n00:24:51.070 --> 00:24:52.850\nMaybe I didn't download my media, or\n\n472\n00:24:52.850 --> 00:24:56.280\nI can't find my ISO and\nI don't wanna cancel the wizard.\n\n473\n00:24:56.280 --> 00:24:58.390\nSo I'll go ahead and\nsay install an operating system later and\n\n474\n00:24:58.390 --> 00:25:01.710\nI'll come back and\nattach the media after the fact.\n\n475\n00:25:01.710 --> 00:25:05.400\nFor me, I'll choose Install an operating\nsystem from a bootable image file.\n\n476\n00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:06.990\nI'll click Browse.\n\n477\n00:25:06.990 --> 00:25:11.200\nI will find, I've gone here before so\nit remembers my last location.\n\n478\n00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:15.300\nI'll grab my ISO of Server 2016,\nand I'll click Open.\n\n479\n00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:16.980\nRemember, it's all virtual.\n\n480\n00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:20.580\nSo this is a virtual machine that\nhas a virtual hard drive, and\n\n481\n00:25:20.580 --> 00:25:25.600\nI'm now taking a virtual DVD and\nputting it into a virtual DVD player,\n\n482\n00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:30.170\nmy ISO is being mounted\nup into this DVD player.\n\n483\n00:25:30.170 --> 00:25:34.350\nI'll click Next, I get a summary\nof everything that I chose,\n\n484\n00:25:34.350 --> 00:25:37.570\nit gives me a chance to go back and\nchange anything if I need to.\n\n485\n00:25:37.570 --> 00:25:41.950\nIf I'm happy I click Finish, and\nit goes through the process.\n\n486\n00:25:42.970 --> 00:25:46.710\nAnd there we go,\nwe have our first VM created.\n\n487\n00:25:46.710 --> 00:25:51.290\nNow if I had chosen to do a,\nwell, we'll come back to that.\n\n488\n00:25:51.290 --> 00:25:55.810\nSo let's start it up, I'm gonna connect\nto it so we can see the process.\n\n489\n00:25:55.810 --> 00:25:58.490\nSo I'll connect to it first,\nthen we're going to start it.\n\n490\n00:25:58.490 --> 00:25:59.450\nAnd I'll click Start.\n\n491\n00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:03.710\nAnd what should happen is it's\ngot a blank hard drive and\n\n492\n00:26:03.710 --> 00:26:07.550\nthere it goes right press\nany key to boot to the DVD\n\n493\n00:26:07.550 --> 00:26:10.080\nbecause it's got a blank hard drive,\nno operating system found.\n\n494\n00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:12.820\nSo normal Windows behavior\nis let me check and\n\n495\n00:26:12.820 --> 00:26:18.520\nsee if there's any bootable media via\nUSB or If you have CD-ROM, sure enough,\n\n496\n00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:23.470\nit found my server 2016 ISO that I had\nmounted up and there goes the process.\n\n497\n00:26:23.470 --> 00:26:25.930\nI can see it installing Server 2016.\n\n498\n00:26:25.930 --> 00:26:30.010\nI'm not gonna continue on cuz hopefully\nyou've seen at this point the install of\n\n499\n00:26:30.010 --> 00:26:31.200\nan operating system.\n\n500\n00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:33.710\nThis is gonna be no different\nthat a physical machine.\n\n501\n00:26:33.710 --> 00:26:35.370\nThere's absolutely no difference.\n\n502\n00:26:35.370 --> 00:26:37.190\nYou still go through the same steps.\n\n503\n00:26:37.190 --> 00:26:40.610\nYou still provide administrator password,\nyou do your Windows updates.\n\n504\n00:26:40.610 --> 00:26:44.330\nAll that stuff happens just like\nthis was a physical machine.\n\n505\n00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:49.290\nAnd I'll show you since this is a test\nmachine, we don't really care about it.\n\n506\n00:26:49.290 --> 00:26:50.680\nI'll show you what turning\nit off looks like.\n\n507\n00:26:52.450 --> 00:26:53.350\nAre you sure?\n\n508\n00:26:53.350 --> 00:26:57.030\nThis is equivalent to turning off your\ncomputer, so data loss is possible.\n\n509\n00:26:57.030 --> 00:26:57.830\nYes, turn off.\n\n510\n00:26:59.020 --> 00:26:59.590\nAnd that's it.\n\n511\n00:26:59.590 --> 00:27:00.310\nI mean it's done.\n\n512\n00:27:00.310 --> 00:27:03.850\nIt just ceases to exist, or\nI mean it ceases to be running.\n\n513\n00:27:03.850 --> 00:27:06.320\nSo it's a very ungraceful shutdown,\n\n514\n00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:09.290\nnot something you want to do\nintentionally most of the time.\n\n515\n00:27:10.310 --> 00:27:12.380\nAll right, Cherokee,\nso we've created a VM.\n\n516\n00:27:12.380 --> 00:27:15.140\nI do want to show, you know,\nthat was the wizard.\n\n517\n00:27:15.140 --> 00:27:18.420\nI want to go through and show you how\nto create a disk ahead of time and\n\n518\n00:27:18.420 --> 00:27:20.568\nthen create a virtual\nmachine based off that.\n\n519\n00:27:20.568 --> 00:27:23.370\nI'll also wanna show you how\nto do some differencing disks,\n\n520\n00:27:23.370 --> 00:27:27.560\nhow we can take one server install and\nactually spin up a couple of machines\n\n521\n00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:31.040\nbased of of that, saves you a lot of time\nif you are trying to create test labs.\n\n522\n00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:32.390\nSo we got little bit more to do.\n\n523\n00:27:32.390 --> 00:27:35.460\n&gt;&gt; Well, I'm excited because that was\na great introduction to Hyper-V and\n\n524\n00:27:35.460 --> 00:27:38.530\nworking with our virtual machines here,\nthank you for that.\n\n525\n00:27:38.530 --> 00:27:41.170\nThank you for joining us as well,\nbut for now we'll sign out.\n\n526\n00:27:41.170 --> 00:27:42.540\nI've been your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n527\n00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:43.360\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n528\n00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:45.477\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV\n\n529\n00:27:45.477 -->

00:00:07.544\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:07.544 --> 00:00:12.083\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.083 --> 00:00:16.023\n&gt;&gt; Welcome everyone to your\nConfiguring Windows Devices, studying for\n\n6\n00:00:16.023 --> 00:00:17.990\nthat 70-697 exam.\n\n7\n00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:19.830\nI'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n8\n00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.510\nIn this episode, we'll continue taking\na look at Hyper-V, we've made it to\n\n9\n00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:28.950\npart five, and you know it, Mister Mike\nRodrick, back in studios with us today.\n\n10\n00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:30.090\nHey Mike, how's it going?\n\n11\n00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.610\n&gt;&gt; Going great, yeah, we got a little\nmini-series going here with Hyper-V, but-\n\n12\n00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:34.902\n&gt;&gt; I know, we're on our way there.\n\n13\n00:00:34.902 --> 00:00:38.060\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, hopefully everybody is enjoying\nit and learning a lot as we go.\n\n14\n00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:40.730\nWe've got our virtual hard drives,\nwe've talked about those,\n\n15\n00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:42.395\nlooked at how we can create those.\n\n16\n00:00:42.395 --> 00:00:45.100\nIn a previous episode,\nwe've just created our first\n\n17\n00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:49.480\nvirtual machine within Hyper-V\nrunning on a Windows 10 machine.\n\n18\n00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.310\nAnd we used the wizard to create that,\nwhich gives us some choices, but\n\n19\n00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:54.820\ndoesn't give us all the options.\n\n20\n00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.430\nThe biggest one as that hard drive screen\nwhere when I go to create the VM and\n\n21\n00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.470\nI get to the VHD page,\nI only have three choices.\n\n22\n00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:08.045\nI can create a dynamically\nexpanding VHDX right then and\n\n23\n00:01:08.045 --> 00:01:13.988\nthere, or attach an existing one,\nor attach one later on.\n\n24\n00:01:13.988 --> 00:01:18.100\nSo let's take a look at that option,\nwhether you attach it.\n\n25\n00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.175\nActually you'll see how we could do this,\nwe'll do both.\n\n26\n00:01:20.175 --> 00:01:22.260\nLet' go ahead and create a new VHD.\n\n27\n00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.920\nYou saw this in the previous episodes.\n\n28\n00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.950\nSo go back and check that out, I'm gonna\ngo kind of quick, new virtual hard disk.\n\n29\n00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.590\nWe'll click next, I'm gonna do VHDX.\n\n30\n00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.888\nWe'll click next, dynamically expanding.\n\n31\n00:01:33.888 --> 00:01:38.600\nSimply says that we don't have to wait for\nit to format, and\n\n32\n00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.786\nI'm gonna call this, second,\nI'll just call this drive02 or\n\n33\n00:01:43.786 --> 00:01:50.227\nsomething like that, and maybe we put it\nin our VHDs folder so I can find it later.\n\n34\n00:01:51.266 --> 00:01:56.424\nThen we click Next, and\nI'll do the default,\n\n35\n00:01:56.424 --> 00:01:59.476\n127, Next And Finish.\n\n36\n00:01:59.476 --> 00:02:03.080\nSo now I've built a hard drive of VHD,\nbut it's not attached to anything.\n\n37\n00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.480\nIt's just sitting there.\n\n38\n00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:09.899\nWe go take a look at File Explorer,\nand there it is somewhere,\n\n39\n00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:14.550\ndrive02, right there, 4 megs in size.\n\n40\n00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.550\nAll right, so now I'm gonna\ncreate a new virtual machine.\n\n41\n00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.180\nWalk through the wizard again,\nwe've seen this one.\n\n42\n00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:27.652\nI'll call this one secondVM,\ncuz I'm so creative like that.\n\n43\n00:02:27.652 --> 00:02:28.816\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm just gonna leave it in\n\n44\n00:02:28.816 --> 00:02:29.570\nthe default location.\n\n45\n00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:32.927\nI'll click, actually you know what,\nno, I'll leave it in default.\n\n46\n00:02:32.927 --> 00:02:35.220\nWe'll click Next, I'll do generation two.\n\n47\n00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.770\nWe've seen this before so\nI'm going kinda quick.\n\n48\n00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:45.910\nI'll give it a little bit of memory,\nAnd check my num lock, there we go.\n\n49\n00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.110\nWe'll click next, not going to connect it.\n\n50\n00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.800\nHere's what we wanted to focus on for\nthis part.\n\n51\n00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:55.730\nSo earlier we created one where we built\nthe VHD during the creation of the VM.\n\n52\n00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.310\nWe said you're limited\ndynamically expanding VHDX.\n\n53\n00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.970\nNow I'm gonna use an existing\nvirtual hard disk.\n\n54\n00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.900\nAnd I made a dynamic disk just for\ntime constraints on our episode, but\n\n55\n00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.370\nif I wanted a fixed disk for\na VM, this is how you do it.\n\n56\n00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.740\nI should've, you know what,\nI'm not gonna do that.\n\n57\n00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:17.840\nI'm gonna jump back out and\nwe're gonna create a new VHD.\n\n58\n00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.740\nI hate saying, it would be like this,\nwhy don't I just do it for you?\n\n59\n00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:28.305\nSo let's say new hard disk,\nNext, VHDX, and let's do fixed,\n\n60\n00:03:28.305 --> 00:03:32.753\nbecause I can't do fixed\nduring the new VM wizard.\n\n61\n00:03:32.753 --> 00:03:35.080\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So, I'm gonna do fixed, and\n\n62\n00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:39.880\nI'll call this one fixed demo or\nsomething like that.\n\n63\n00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:44.170\nOr, let's say fixed03, cuz I think\nI've got a few of those in there.\n\n64\n00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:49.580\nWe'll change that to my VMs folder,\nI'm sorry, my VHD folder.\n\n65\n00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:52.740\nAnd we'll click Next.\n\n66\n00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:55.830\nAnd I'm not going to do 127 gigabytes,\nbecause that would take way too long.\n\n67\n00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:57.010\nOur episode would be over.\n\n68\n00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:01.540\nI'm only going to make\nthis one five gigabytes.\n\n69\n00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:04.470\nNow I know I could not install\nan operating system on that.\n\n70\n00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:08.150\nThis is just to show you how to create\nyour fixed drive a head of time\n\n71\n00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.730\nto build your VM.\n\n72\n00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:12.700\nYou would want to give it at least 60\ngigs if you're installing Windows.\n\n73\n00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:15.230\nWe're gonna click Next and then Finish.\n\n74\n00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:19.260\nSo now I have, and\nit's gonna take it a second,\n\n75\n00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:25.310\nbecause it's gotta allocate that space and\nformat that space for use.\n\n76\n00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:31.390\nSo we'll let it run through here, but\nthis is the only way you can create a VM\n\n77\n00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:36.430\nusing a fixed disk or a fixed type VHD,\n\n78\n00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:41.420\nis to either create the drive ahead\nof time or create it after the fact.\n\n79\n00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:43.790\nYou cannot create one\nusing the new VM wizard.\n\n80\n00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:45.260\nYou can also use PowerShell.\n\n81\n00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:46.060\nWe took a look at that.\n\n82\n00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:50.710\nYou can use a PowerShell command to create\nyour fixed drive ahead of time, and\n\n83\n00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:52.842\nthen go build your VMs after the fact.\n\n84\n00:04:52.842 --> 00:04:56.989\nSo we'll let this finish up,\nit's just about done.\n\n85\n00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:00.270\nWe're getting close to that finish line,\ngo.\n\n86\n00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:00.970\nThere we go.\n\n87\n00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:05.860\nAll right, so now I should\nhave fixed03 sitting here, and\n\n88\n00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:08.420\nit's 5 gigabytes in size.\n\n89\n00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:14.794\nSo now when I go to create my new VM,\nso virtual machine,\n\n90\n00:05:14.794 --> 00:05:19.285\nNext, I'll call this one FixedDemo.\n\n91\n00:05:19.285 --> 00:05:26.372\nI'll leave it in the default location,\ngeneration 2, 4096 on my memory.\n\n92\n00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:31.930\nAnd here instead of creating a drive,\ngonna say no, no, no,\n\n93\n00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:33.570\nI've already built a drive.\n\n94\n00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:39.276\nUse an existing, and I'll browse and\n\n95\n00:05:39.276 --> 00:05:43.207\nI'll find my fixed03.\n\n96\n00:05:43.207 --> 00:05:47.833\nSo now its path is in there,\nE:\\VHDs\\fixed03.\n\n97\n00:05:47.833 --> 00:05:51.730\nWe'll click Next and Finish.\n\n98\n00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:54.370\nAnd I now have a VM built\n\n99\n00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:58.812\nthat's using a fixed drive instead\nof a dynamically expanding drive.\n\n100\n00:05:58.812 --> 00:06:02.060\nNow it's not gonna do a whole lot because\nthere's nothing installed on that fixed\n\n101\n00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:03.010\ndrive yet.\n\n102\n00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:08.100\nI would still need to install\nan operating system on that drive.\n\n103\n00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:11.470\nAll right, let's see what else.\n\n104\n00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:15.894\nSo we've seen how to build a VM using the\nwizard, and just accepting the dynamically\n\n105\n00:06:15.894 --> 00:06:19.210\nexpanding drive that it gives\nme the ability to create.\n\n106\n00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:22.820\nWe've taken a look at creating\na disk ahead of time, and\n\n107\n00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:24.620\nthen attaching it to a VM.\n\n108\n00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:27.290\nLet's build a VM without a disk.\n\n109\n00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:33.800\nSo I'm gonna say new VM, Next,\ncall this one, I don't know.\n\n110\n00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:34.386\n&gt;&gt; Third?\n\n111\n00:06:34.386 --> 00:06:35.153\n&gt;&gt; Third, yeah.\n\n112\n00:06:35.153 --> 00:06:36.171\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I like that.\n\n113\n00:06:36.171 --> 00:06:40.500\nThird VM, and\nI'm just gonna again quickly go through\n\n114\n00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:44.650\nthe wizard here until we get\nto my hard drive screen.\n\n115\n00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:50.890\nThis time I'll do the third option,\nattach a virtual hard disk later, and\n\n116\n00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:57.550\nI'll click Next, and Finish,\nand so now here's third VM.\n\n117\n00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:03.470\nBut if I try to start it up,\nWell it doesn't even have a hard drive.\n\n118\n00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:06.770\n&gt;&gt; You're kind of just like prepping the\nfood, getting it ready for dinner, right?\n\n119\n00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:08.470\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n120\n00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:11.260\nMaybe my job is to spin up the VMs,\nand somebody else,\n\n121\n00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.430\nI guess,\nprobably not on a client operating system.\n\n122\n00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:16.750\nBut you know, like I said,\nmaybe you realize as you're going through\n\n123\n00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:21.740\nthe wizard, shoot, I want to use a fixed\ndrive, which I can't do in the wizard.\n\n124\n00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:22.350\nSo I'll go ahead and\n\n125\n00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:26.110\nfinish creating the virtual machine,\nthen I'll attach the hard disk later.\n\n126\n00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:28.868\nSo if I want to attach the hard\ndisk after the fact, one,\n\n127\n00:07:28.868 --> 00:07:30.235\nI need to turn this guy off.\n\n128\n00:07:30.235 --> 00:07:34.146\nAll right, I would end up pulling\nup the settings, oops, for this VM.\n\n129\n00:07:34.146 --> 00:07:39.040\nNow we've got a lot to talk about\nwith these settings, bear with me.\n\n130\n00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:41.090\nWe'll come back and\nwe'll go through all of these.\n\n131\n00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:47.200\nBut for the hard drive itself, if I\nsee there's no hard drive listed here.\n\n132\n00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:50.552\nSo, I'm going to go to add hardware,\nI'll zoom back out.\n\n133\n00:07:54.385 --> 00:07:57.835\nAnd I'm sorry, I'm going to have to go\nto my SCSI controller, not add hardware,\n\n134\n00:07:57.835 --> 00:07:59.494\nI have to go down to my SCSI controller.\n\n135\n00:07:59.494 --> 00:08:02.699\nAnd there I can choose, and\nI'll zoom in so you can see that.\n\n136\n00:08:02.699 --> 00:08:05.790\nSo there's nothing connected\ncurrently to my controller.\n\n137\n00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:08.800\nI'm gonna choose Hard Drive and click Add.\n\n138\n00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:11.810\nNow I can create one from right here.\n\n139\n00:08:11.810 --> 00:08:19.080\nIt'll launch the new VHD wizard if I click\nthis New button or I can click Browse.\n\n140\n00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:24.914\nAnd I can go find an existing VHD and I'm\njust gonna grab any one to prove a point.\n\n141\n00:08:24.914 --> 00:08:32.205\nWe'll do Fixed03 again, click Open and OK.\n\n142\n00:08:32.205 --> 00:08:35.998\nAll right, so there's how you\nattach a hard drive after the fact.\n\n143\n00:08:35.998 --> 00:08:39.830\nYou've already created the VM, you had\na VHD that you wanted to attach to it,\n\n144\n00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:42.040\nand that's how you would go in and\nattach it.\n\n145\n00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:45.930\nNow what I just did is definitely a no-no\nright, you don't want two virtual machines\n\n146\n00:08:45.930 --> 00:08:48.610\nattached to the same VHD,\nthat would not work.\n\n147\n00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:50.690\nThis is just for demonstration purposes.\n\n148\n00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:52.980\nSo make sure you guys are aware of that.\n\n149\n00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:59.950\nAll right, so that is creating\na VM in several different ways.\n\n150\n00:08:59.950 --> 00:09:02.590\nThe next thing I wanna show you,\nwe've seen fixed,\n\n151\n00:09:02.590 --> 00:09:06.060\nwe've seen dynamic,\nwe did talk about differencing drives.\n\n152\n00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:10.650\nIn our VHD episode, we talked about\nhow differencing drives are a way\n\n153\n00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:15.160\nto store all the changes without\naffecting the base drive.\n\n154\n00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:18.960\nAnd I said it's a really\ngood way to do test labs.\n\n155\n00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:20.840\nPerformance wise it's not the best.\n\n156\n00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:23.300\nYou're probably not gonna\nsee that in production.\n\n157\n00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:28.364\nBut, if I need to spin\nup three 2016 servers,\n\n158\n00:09:28.364 --> 00:09:34.650\nI don't want to have to install\nserver 2016 three times.\n\n159\n00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:37.977\nI don't wanna have to update\nserver 2016 three times.\n\n160\n00:09:37.977 --> 00:09:41.900\nI just need a little test lab to play with\nand then I'm gonna end up blowing it away.\n\n161\n00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:45.080\nSo differencing drives\nare a great way to go here.\n\n162\n00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:50.090\nSo let's take a look at how we can\nuse those differencing drives.\n\n163\n00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:55.482\nSo what I did earlier is I built\nup a Server 2016 virtual machine.\n\n164\n00:09:55.482 --> 00:10:02.210\nSo I built a VM, I created a disk,\nI installed Server 2016 on it and\n\n165\n00:10:02.210 --> 00:10:06.210\nthen I CIS-prepped it and I shut it down.\n\n166\n00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:11.208\nSo I generalized the image, removed all\nthe uniquely identifying information,\n\n167\n00:10:11.208 --> 00:10:13.980\nsids from that image, and shut it down.\n\n168\n00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:15.640\nAnd it hasn't been turned on since.\n\n169\n00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:18.542\nSo it's basically a CIS-prepped drive.\n\n170\n00:10:18.542 --> 00:10:26.420\nNow that drive is located, if we go\nback over here into my VMs in 2016.\n\n171\n00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:29.620\nAnd Virtual Hard Disks,\nthere's that drive right there,\n\n172\n00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:33.420\ndrive right there is about 10 gigs,\na little more in size.\n\n173\n00:10:35.290 --> 00:10:40.800\nSo now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna\ncreate a new Server 2016 machine\n\n174\n00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:42.340\nusing a differencing drive.\n\n175\n00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:47.080\nNow remember in the wizard I cannot\ncreate a differencing drive.\n\n176\n00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:50.930\nSo I'm going to have to create it\neither before or after I create the VM.\n\n177\n00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:53.290\nI'm going to choose to create it before.\n\n178\n00:10:53.290 --> 00:10:58.560\nI'm going to choose new hard disk And\nI'm going to click Next.\n\n179\n00:11:00.010 --> 00:11:05.800\nAnd I'll do VHDX and I'll click Next,\nwe're gonna do differencing for\n\n180\n00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:08.620\nthis one and you've seen this in\nthe previous episode hopefully.\n\n181\n00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:14.368\nWe'll click Next, and I'm gonna tell\nit what I wanna call this one, and\n\n182\n00:11:14.368 --> 00:11:19.565\nI'll call it diffdemo01, and\nI'll put that in my VHD folder.\n\n183\n00:11:23.761 --> 00:11:28.659\nThen I'll click Next and then specify the\nvirtual hard disk that you want to use as\n\n184\n00:11:28.659 --> 00:11:32.570\nthe parent for\nthe new differencing virtual hard disk.\n\n185\n00:11:32.570 --> 00:11:36.703\nI'm gonna click Browse and\nI'm gonna go find that server 2016 box.\n\n186\n00:11:42.201 --> 00:11:47.097\nAnd we'll click open, so now it knows\nwhere the parent is, we'll click next and\n\n187\n00:11:47.097 --> 00:11:47.685\nfinish.\n\n188\n00:11:49.570 --> 00:11:54.070\nSo I've built my first differencing disc,\nI'm gonna build another one.\n\n189\n00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:57.320\nI'm gonna go new, virtual hard disc.\n\n190\n00:11:58.330 --> 00:12:00.967\nAgain, I'll do this quick since you've\nalready seen it a couple of times,\n\n191\n00:12:00.967 --> 00:12:01.555\ndifferencing.\n\n192\n00:12:01.555 --> 00:12:02.850\n&gt;&gt; Are you just walking through this Mike?\n\n193\n00:12:02.850 --> 00:12:05.910\nYou're literally taking a few\nseconds per virtual machine.\n\n194\n00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:09.770\nAnd if you look historically at how long\nit would take to go ahead and provision\n\n195\n00:12:09.770 --> 00:12:15.340\nand set up machines in the past, you can\nsee why virtualization is so popular.\n\n196\n00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:18.050\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, and\nhow long would it have taken you to, and\n\n197\n00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:22.230\nnow I've gotta find the parent,\nto spin up two more 2016 machines.\n\n198\n00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:24.729\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n199\n00:12:24.729 --> 00:12:28.790\n&gt;&gt; All right, so I've told it where the\nparent is, we'll click Next and Finish.\n\n200\n00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:31.120\nSo now I have these two drives.\n\n201\n00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:34.488\nNow I'm gonna make a new virtual machine.\n\n202\n00:12:36.871 --> 00:12:45.160\nAnd I'm gonna name this one 2016diff01,\njust so we'll know what it is.\n\n203\n00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:47.080\nI'm gonna leave all\nthe default locations there.\n\n204\n00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:49.440\nIt's gonna be a generation 2.\n\n205\n00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:56.540\nNext, start up memory 4096,\nwe'll click Next, not gonna connect it.\n\n206\n00:12:56.540 --> 00:12:59.570\nNow, here, I've already created\nmy differencing drive, so\n\n207\n00:12:59.570 --> 00:13:00.970\nI don't want to create a new drive.\n\n208\n00:13:00.970 --> 00:13:05.400\nI wanna attach or\nuse an existing virtual hard disk.\n\n209\n00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:10.395\nI'll click Browse and\nback over to VHDs and\n\n210\n00:13:10.395 --> 00:13:16.372\ndiffdemo01, and Open,\nand Next, and Finish.\n\n211\n00:13:18.677 --> 00:13:23.102\nAll right, so there is,\nlet's move this down.\n\n212\n00:13:23.102 --> 00:13:24.611\n&gt;&gt; You got quite a list going here,\nMike [LAUGH].\n\n213\n00:13:24.611 --> 00:13:27.180\n&gt;&gt; I know, right.\n\n214\n00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:28.370\nThere's 2016 diff01.\n\n215\n00:13:28.370 --> 00:13:35.036\nLet's make another VM,\nnew virtual machine, Next.\n\n216\n00:13:35.036 --> 00:13:42.017\nI wanna call it 2016, diff02.\n\n217\n00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:47.410\nNext, generation two,\nNext, 4096, Next, Next,\n\n218\n00:13:47.410 --> 00:13:52.860\nuse an existing, and\n\n219\n00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:56.980\nI'm gonna browse and find that\nsecond differencing disk we made.\n\n220\n00:13:58.610 --> 00:13:59.770\nAnd then just finish that real quick.\n\n221\n00:13:59.770 --> 00:14:02.130\nAgain, you're seeing the wizard,\nso not that exciting there.\n\n222\n00:14:02.130 --> 00:14:05.120\nSo now I've got two new 2016 machines.\n\n223\n00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:06.590\nLet's see if I can start these guys up.\n\n224\n00:14:06.590 --> 00:14:09.420\nI'm gonna connect to that first one and\nclick start.\n\n225\n00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:11.668\nThen we'll see what happens.\n\n226\n00:14:13.536 --> 00:14:16.273\nFingers crossed, drum roll,\nall that good stuff.\n\n227\n00:14:16.273 --> 00:14:18.798\n&gt;&gt; I think I'm like the worst host,\n\n228\n00:14:18.798 --> 00:14:23.970\nmy drum roll skills are just\nunparred compared to Les and Daniel.\n\n229\n00:14:23.970 --> 00:14:25.923\n&gt;&gt; Yeah?\nYou can't do like a [SOUND]?\n\n230\n00:14:25.923 --> 00:14:27.217\n&gt;&gt; No.\nThey've been on a band,\n\n231\n00:14:27.217 --> 00:14:28.131\nthey've been trained.\n\n232\n00:14:28.131 --> 00:14:33.090\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right so\nlet's spin this guy up.\n\n233\n00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:37.654\nAgain, what you want to, let's just well,\nwe'll wait and see for the,\n\n234\n00:14:37.654 --> 00:14:40.210\nwe'll see the excitement\nhere in just a second.\n\n235\n00:14:40.210 --> 00:14:42.660\nSo keep in mind what\nwe've just accomplished.\n\n236\n00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:47.760\nI have a server 2016 CIS prep machine\nsitting there and I've just created two\n\n237\n00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:52.920\nbrand new server 2016 VMs\nin less than an episode.\n\n238\n00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:56.960\nI've only taken about five minutes,\nmaybe, to spin these up,\n\n239\n00:14:58.390 --> 00:15:02.100\nand again you know how\nthe first boot goes.\n\n240\n00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:05.310\nThink about this, this is just,\nwe just CIS-prepped that,\n\n241\n00:15:05.310 --> 00:15:08.455\nwell we didn't see that part but\nI had CIS-prepped that 2016 machine.\n\n242\n00:15:08.455 --> 00:15:11.136\nWe've built a new machine\nbased off of that, so\n\n243\n00:15:11.136 --> 00:15:13.827\nthis is just like booting\nup after a CIS-prep.\n\n244\n00:15:13.827 --> 00:15:14.330\n&gt;&gt; The very first time.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n245\n00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:17.996\nIt's basically doing the OOBE type stuff,\ngenerating\n\n246\n00:15:17.996 --> 00:15:22.988\nall it's information that it needs, so\nit does take it a minute to spin up for\n\n247\n00:15:22.988 --> 00:15:26.226\nthe first time, but-\n&gt;&gt; Time isn't the only thing you're\n\n248\n00:15:26.226 --> 00:15:29.854\nsaving, I mean, your energy,\nyour power consumption, resources,\n\n249\n00:15:29.854 --> 00:15:31.130\nphysical space as well.\n\n250\n00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:34.573\nEspecially if you live in an area\nwith high rent like Manhattan or\n\n251\n00:15:34.573 --> 00:15:35.796\nsomething like that.\n\n252\n00:15:35.796 --> 00:15:36.371\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right.\n\n253\n00:15:36.371 --> 00:15:39.103\n&gt;&gt; So there are a lot of reasons\nwhy virtualization is preferred.\n\n254\n00:15:39.103 --> 00:15:40.190\nSo pretty cool Mike.\n\n255\n00:15:40.190 --> 00:15:42.660\n&gt;&gt; Yeah it is, and you can see\ndown there it is getting ready.\n\n256\n00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:47.590\nSo I'll tell you what, let's,\nwell we'll give that a minute to boot up.\n\n257\n00:15:47.590 --> 00:15:51.816\nWhile that is going,\nwhat do we got about ten minutes here?\n\n258\n00:15:51.816 --> 00:15:54.430\nLet's see what else I can show you.\n\n259\n00:15:54.430 --> 00:15:57.076\nI don't wanna start up the second one yet.\n\n260\n00:15:57.076 --> 00:16:00.572\nBecause I understand that I have\na discontention issue, right?\n\n261\n00:16:00.572 --> 00:16:05.850\nI'm on a laptop with a single physical\ndisk for the storing my hard drives.\n\n262\n00:16:05.850 --> 00:16:08.130\nSo if I try to boot two\nmachines at the same time,\n\n263\n00:16:08.130 --> 00:16:09.830\nthe boot process is pretty intense.\n\n264\n00:16:09.830 --> 00:16:12.670\nI have a lot of reads going\non from the hard drive.\n\n265\n00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:15.370\nAnd if I boot two of\nthem up at the same time,\n\n266\n00:16:15.370 --> 00:16:19.920\nit's gonna take much longer than if\nI just start one up, let it finish.\n\n267\n00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:22.350\nStart the next one up,\nlet it finish, right?\n\n268\n00:16:22.350 --> 00:16:25.690\nBecause I don't have raid or anything\nlike that going on underneath here.\n\n269\n00:16:25.690 --> 00:16:28.480\nSo I don't wanna start that one just yet.\n\n270\n00:16:30.110 --> 00:16:34.064\nAll right, looks like it's getting close,\nwatching a little thumbnail down there.\n\n271\n00:16:34.064 --> 00:16:36.270\nLet's go ahead and connect back up to it.\n\n272\n00:16:39.066 --> 00:16:40.308\nAnd I'll tell you what we'll do.\n\n273\n00:16:40.308 --> 00:16:42.330\nOop, as soon as I say that.\n\n274\n00:16:42.330 --> 00:16:44.990\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Like hey, we're gonna step away.\n\n275\n00:16:44.990 --> 00:16:47.270\nIt looks like it's going\nto finish up here.\n\n276\n00:16:47.270 --> 00:16:50.090\n&gt;&gt; And if you were just like for\nthe first time playing around, or\n\n277\n00:16:50.090 --> 00:16:53.400\nnot even just the first time, but\njust wanting to test, you could also use\n\n278\n00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:57.960\nan external if you had a fast solid state\ndrive, or something, to play around with.\n\n279\n00:16:57.960 --> 00:16:59.460\nYou just have to remember, though,\n\n280\n00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:04.310\nif that's where your VHD and VHDX,\nyour virtual machines are residing,\n\n281\n00:17:04.310 --> 00:17:07.430\nyou're not gonna have them available\nunless that drives plugged in.\n\n282\n00:17:07.430 --> 00:17:10.410\nBut you could,\ninstead of buying a whole new laptop, and\n\n283\n00:17:10.410 --> 00:17:12.480\nyou still wanted to play around,\nand you didn't have the hardware.\n\n284\n00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:14.020\nThat's kind of like the work around.\n\n285\n00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:14.620\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n286\n00:17:14.620 --> 00:17:19.280\nAnd if you've got USB 3 you can\nget decent performance for one,\n\n287\n00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:22.940\nmaybe two VMs over there on that external.\n\n288\n00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:25.060\nSo you might have one or\ntwo running locally on your hard drive,\n\n289\n00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:28.690\nand then one or two on an external drive,\nand you could definitely do a few more.\n\n290\n00:17:28.690 --> 00:17:31.790\nAll right, so you can see it's come\nout of sys prep and it's fired up.\n\n291\n00:17:31.790 --> 00:17:36.240\nIt's asking me my, hey, who are are you,\nwhat do you wanna us me for?\n\n292\n00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:38.066\nLet's go ahead and start up that second.\n\n293\n00:17:41.665 --> 00:17:42.699\nIt's responding, there we go.\n\n294\n00:17:42.699 --> 00:17:44.359\nWe'll get that second one fired up.\n\n295\n00:17:47.076 --> 00:17:47.826\nAnd for this one,\n\n296\n00:17:47.826 --> 00:17:51.540\nwe will step away because it's gonna\ntake just as long as the first one did.\n\n297\n00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:55.260\nSo when we come back, we'll see that we\nhave two servers sitting here ready to go.\n\n298\n00:17:57.460 --> 00:17:58.730\nAll right, I think we just finished that.\n\n299\n00:17:58.730 --> 00:18:01.310\nLet's jump back here on my screen here and\nsee what we've got.\n\n300\n00:18:01.310 --> 00:18:08.680\nSo here is 2016 default two and\nif I come back down here is default one.\n\n301\n00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:13.220\nSo you can see I have two separate\nserver instances running.\n\n302\n00:18:14.790 --> 00:18:16.660\nI'm just gonna do, well,\nshould we go through the wizard?\n\n303\n00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.130\nI can't even see the bottom of\nthe wizard to get to it, there we go.\n\n304\n00:18:20.130 --> 00:18:23.280\nWe'll go Next, maybe.\n\n305\n00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:26.364\nThe performance is really gonna\nbe atrocious on this guy, so\n\n306\n00:18:26.364 --> 00:18:29.577\nI don't know if we wanna walk\nthrough the entire process here.\n\n307\n00:18:29.577 --> 00:18:33.685\nCuz again, you've probably seen\nsetting up Server 2016 hopefully,\n\n308\n00:18:33.685 --> 00:18:37.286\nthere's my license terms,\nI'll try to get one of these guys up.\n\n309\n00:18:37.286 --> 00:18:40.882\n&gt;&gt; Okay, and you know what's really\ncool Mike, so you had mentioned I think\n\n310\n00:18:40.882 --> 00:18:44.072\nin a previous episode, you were\nsaying look if we have a parent and\n\n311\n00:18:44.072 --> 00:18:47.900\nthen our children drives our virtual\nmachines, and we had one for DHCP, DNS,\n\n312\n00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:50.870\nand I forget what you said\nmaybe domain controller.\n\n313\n00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:55.450\nSo really the only information that's\nbeing saved to this machine is going to be\n\n314\n00:18:55.450 --> 00:18:58.340\nthose deltas or whatever's\ndifferent from the parent, right?\n\n315\n00:18:58.340 --> 00:18:59.370\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly right.\n\n316\n00:18:59.370 --> 00:19:02.890\nIn fact let's go take a look at what's\ngoing on in the background here.\n\n317\n00:19:02.890 --> 00:19:07.810\nSo when we naviagte into my E drive,\nand we took a look at VHDs,\n\n318\n00:19:07.810 --> 00:19:13.750\nwhat you're gonna see is there's\ntwo disks, here's diffDemo01.\n\n319\n00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:17.370\nAnd notice it's about a gig,\nthe one right below it there's AVHDX,\n\n320\n00:19:17.370 --> 00:19:19.890\nwe haven't really talked about this yet.\n\n321\n00:19:19.890 --> 00:19:24.089\nHyper-V does automatic checkpoints\nif you don't turn them off, and\n\n322\n00:19:24.089 --> 00:19:28.299\nwe just built that VM, so\nit's creating a differencing disk sort of.\n\n323\n00:19:28.299 --> 00:19:33.162\nAgain, I don't wanna get you confused\njust yet, but right now the drive\n\n324\n00:19:33.162 --> 00:19:38.121\nis only a little over a gig in size,\nand yet I'm running Server 2016.\n\n325\n00:19:38.121 --> 00:19:39.027\n&gt;&gt; How's that possible?\n\n326\n00:19:39.027 --> 00:19:40.188\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, how is that possible?\n\n327\n00:19:40.188 --> 00:19:43.415\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There's no way I installed Server 2016\n\n328\n00:19:43.415 --> 00:19:47.630\nDesktop Edition in one gigabyte or\none and a half gigabytes of space.\n\n329\n00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:50.068\nHere's my second diffDemo, right?\n\n330\n00:19:50.068 --> 00:19:53.940\nAnd I can see it's about the same size,\njust a little bit smaller.\n\n331\n00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:57.950\nAgain, another full install 2016 yet\nit's only taking up a gig and a half.\n\n332\n00:19:57.950 --> 00:19:59.170\nHow is that possible?\n\n333\n00:19:59.170 --> 00:20:04.255\nBecause remember these are just\nthe differences between base drive and\n\n334\n00:20:04.255 --> 00:20:08.080\nthis virtual machine\nthat I'm spinning up now.\n\n335\n00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:13.062\nSo as I install things, so\nif I went to one of those diff demos and\n\n336\n00:20:13.062 --> 00:20:15.038\ninstalled DNS on there.\n\n337\n00:20:15.038 --> 00:20:18.898\nThe size would change, or\nif I copied a bunch of files to one,\n\n338\n00:20:18.898 --> 00:20:23.010\nthe size of this drive,\nthe differencing disk, would change.\n\n339\n00:20:23.010 --> 00:20:30.240\nBut all the common files are still\nback over here in this one, right.\n\n340\n00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:33.620\nThis is where the actual operating\nsystem is installed, things like that.\n\n341\n00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:38.640\nNow if I did a Windows update to one\nof the machines, but not the other.\n\n342\n00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:44.430\nIt doesn't go to this drive, right,\nit would be in these drives,\n\n343\n00:20:44.430 --> 00:20:47.590\nright, cuz nothing is gonna be\nwritten to that parent drive anymore.\n\n344\n00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:50.580\nNo changes can be made\nto that parent drive,\n\n345\n00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:53.170\notherwise the child drive\nwon't recognize it anymore.\n\n346\n00:20:53.170 --> 00:20:56.550\nSo the parent drive sits there,\nit stays, it's unmodified.\n\n347\n00:20:56.550 --> 00:21:00.390\nThese guys are just storing any changes\nsince that parent drive was made.\n\n348\n00:21:00.390 --> 00:21:05.410\nAnd if I wanted a third server, I said,\nyou know what I need three, not two.\n\n349\n00:21:05.410 --> 00:21:08.349\nI simply go create a new\ndifferencing disk, create a new VM,\n\n350\n00:21:08.349 --> 00:21:10.724\npoint it to the differencing disk and\nI'm done.\n\n351\n00:21:10.724 --> 00:21:15.794\nI've got a new server in a matter of\nminutes instead of a matter of 45 minutes\n\n352\n00:21:15.794 --> 00:21:20.943\nto an hour to install 2016, and\nstart getting all of those updates set up.\n\n353\n00:21:20.943 --> 00:21:26.370\nSo, real quick easy way to spin\nup a few servers for a test lab.\n\n354\n00:21:26.370 --> 00:21:30.290\nAnd honestly, with Hyper-V Windows 10,\nit's most likely what we're doing.\n\n355\n00:21:30.290 --> 00:21:33.410\nThis is not production level,\nwe're not using this to\n\n356\n00:21:33.410 --> 00:21:37.610\nhost VMs that are providing services\nto the network, most likely.\n\n357\n00:21:37.610 --> 00:21:40.060\nWe're doing this as test and development.\n\n358\n00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:43.390\nMaybe we're developing one that will\neventually move to the production server,\n\n359\n00:21:43.390 --> 00:21:45.760\nbut we're not running it on here for\nproduction.\n\n360\n00:21:48.250 --> 00:21:50.590\nIf I'm just doing a test lab, hey,\n\n361\n00:21:50.590 --> 00:21:56.020\nmy boss has tasked me with testing\nout the new OneNote features,\n\n362\n00:21:56.020 --> 00:22:00.210\nor some shared office thing, and\nI need a couple VMs to test it out on,\n\n363\n00:22:00.210 --> 00:22:05.390\nspin them up real quick easy, blow them\naway when I'm done, and we are good to go.\n\n364\n00:22:05.390 --> 00:22:07.780\nSo that is creating VMs.\n\n365\n00:22:07.780 --> 00:22:11.110\nWe took a look at creating\na VM using the Wizard.\n\n366\n00:22:11.110 --> 00:22:15.304\nWe created some virtual hard drives ahead\nof time then attached them to a VM.\n\n367\n00:22:15.304 --> 00:22:19.702\nWe also took a look at\ndifferencing drives and\n\n368\n00:22:19.702 --> 00:22:26.892\nhow I can spin up two separate instances\nor more, using the parent drive.\n\n369\n00:22:26.892 --> 00:22:29.682\nProbably one thing that I should\npoint out, this is again, we talked\n\n370\n00:22:29.682 --> 00:22:32.824\na little bit about this when we talked\nabout virtual hard drives themselves.\n\n371\n00:22:32.824 --> 00:22:37.268\nPerformance is gonna be an issue, because\nboth of these machines have their own\n\n372\n00:22:37.268 --> 00:22:41.067\nvirtual hard drive, right,\nthat they can store their changes in.\n\n373\n00:22:41.067 --> 00:22:45.078\nBut both of these machines are reaching\nback to that parent drive to get those\n\n374\n00:22:45.078 --> 00:22:46.792\nbase operating systems files.\n\n375\n00:22:46.792 --> 00:22:50.710\nAnd a third or\nfourth differencing drive based\n\n376\n00:22:50.710 --> 00:22:54.310\nmachine is pointing back to that parent,\nyou can see where I'm going, right?\n\n377\n00:22:54.310 --> 00:22:57.575\nThere is a lot of contention for\nthat base drive,\n\n378\n00:22:57.575 --> 00:23:01.410\nthat Sysprep 2016 drive\nthat I've got back there.\n\n379\n00:23:02.540 --> 00:23:07.360\nKeep in mind too that if I decide\nthat these machines are done,\n\n380\n00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:12.570\nand I want to blow them away, I'll delete\nthem, I won't delete that base drive,\n\n381\n00:23:12.570 --> 00:23:17.590\nnothing's changed with that,\nit's still in its pristine Sysprep state.\n\n382\n00:23:17.590 --> 00:23:22.070\nSo if I blow these two virtual machines\naway, create two brand new differencing\n\n383\n00:23:22.070 --> 00:23:26.200\ndisks and two brand new VMs that\nare using those differencing disks,\n\n384\n00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:28.240\nI'll be in the exact\nsame state I am in now.\n\n385\n00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:31.801\nI don't have to start all\nover with that 2016 machine.\n\n386\n00:23:31.801 --> 00:23:35.720\nIt's already installed, updated,\nsysprepped, and shut down, and\n\n387\n00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:37.190\nit's just gonna sit there.\n\n388\n00:23:37.190 --> 00:23:41.810\nNow at some point,\nwhen I spin up a new differencing disk and\n\n389\n00:23:41.810 --> 00:23:46.500\na new server based off of that parent,\nI'm gonna have to do updates again, right?\n\n390\n00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:50.345\nBecause I built that base drive,\nlet's say, six months ago.\n\n391\n00:23:50.345 --> 00:23:54.400\nAnd I know there's updates that have\ncome out that I need to get in there.\n\n392\n00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:58.330\nWell, I can either spin up\nnew VMs like I did here and\n\n393\n00:23:58.330 --> 00:24:01.740\nupdate these, but\nthat means I'm updating each one of them.\n\n394\n00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:06.850\nOr I can go back to that parent drive I\ndon't know how I made it quite that small.\n\n395\n00:24:06.850 --> 00:24:07.560\nThere we go.\n\n396\n00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:09.980\nI could go back to that parent drive and\nupdate it.\n\n397\n00:24:09.980 --> 00:24:14.290\nI would have to make a new machine,\nfire up that parent drive, do its updates,\n\n398\n00:24:14.290 --> 00:24:16.750\nSysprep it, and shut it down again.\n\n399\n00:24:16.750 --> 00:24:20.200\nAnd I'd have to build any children\nall over again because again,\n\n400\n00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:22.780\nas soon as that parent drive changes,\nthose children,\n\n401\n00:24:22.780 --> 00:24:26.955\nthose child drives are not gonna recognize\nthe parent, so keep that in mind.\n\n402\n00:24:26.955 --> 00:24:29.300\nBut in a test environment,\nthat's perfectly fine,\n\n403\n00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:31.530\nI don't keep machines longer than 30 days.\n\n404\n00:24:31.530 --> 00:24:34.230\nHope that will help you\nout taking this exam,\n\n405\n00:24:34.230 --> 00:24:38.880\nunderstanding the different types of\ndrives and other in the virtual machines.\n\n406\n00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:41.820\nAnd also hope it helps you guys if\nyou need to set up a test lab as you\n\n407\n00:24:41.820 --> 00:24:42.900\nare studying.\n\n408\n00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:43.990\nI wanna speed server 2016,\n\n409\n00:24:43.990 --> 00:24:48.250\nI don't have a physical machine to do\nthat on, how can I play around with it?\n\n410\n00:24:48.250 --> 00:24:49.510\nThis is how you do it.\n\n411\n00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:52.160\n&gt;&gt; Awesome Mike, thank you so much for\ntaking the time to show us how to create\n\n412\n00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:54.510\nall those different types\nof virtual machines.\n\n413\n00:24:54.510 --> 00:24:58.360\nI know we have a lot to continue with so\nlet's go ahead and sign out for this show.\n\n414\n00:24:58.360 --> 00:24:59.720\nI've been your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n415\n00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:02.840\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n416\n00:25:02.840 -->

00:00:11.979\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.979 --> 00:00:13.403\n&gt;&gt; Welcome everyone to your\n\n5\n00:00:13.403 --> 00:00:16.800\nConfiguring Windows Devices for\nthat 70-697 exam.\n\n6\n00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.728\nI'm your host Cherokee Boose, and in this\nepisode we'll be taking a look at, well,\n\n7\n00:00:20.728 --> 00:00:22.704\nmore HyperV, we're back with a part six.\n\n8\n00:00:22.704 --> 00:00:26.460\nAnd of course you know it, Mr.\nMike Roderick in studio's with us today.\n\n9\n00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.120\nHow's it going, Mike?\n&gt;&gt; It's going great, Cherokee.\n\n10\n00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:29.250\nThanks for having me back,\n\n11\n00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.630\nand excited as always to be here\ntalking with everybody out there.\n\n12\n00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:34.640\nAnd yeah, we've got more Hyper-V, right.\n\n13\n00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.280\nIn the previous episodes, we've looked\nat creating the virtual hard drives for\n\n14\n00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:40.380\nour virtual machines.\n\n15\n00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:42.370\nWe've also created virtual machines using-\n&gt;&gt; Quite a few.\n\n16\n00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:44.020\n&gt;&gt; Those different types, yeah.\n\n17\n00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.980\nWe created using fixed size drives,\ndynamic disks.\n\n18\n00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:49.760\nWe also looked at differencing disks,\nright.\n\n19\n00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.840\nWe built up two servers, but\nonly had to install server once,\n\n20\n00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.465\nwhich is always good.\n&gt;&gt; Pretty cool.\n\n21\n00:00:54.465 --> 00:00:55.251\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and so\n\n22\n00:00:55.251 --> 00:00:57.310\nnow we're going to move on.\n\n23\n00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:01.340\nAnd our next phase is gonna be to\ntake a look at how we can network\n\n24\n00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:02.635\nthese machines together, right.\n\n25\n00:01:02.635 --> 00:01:06.095\nBecause we build up all these VMs,\nif they can't talk to each other and\n\n26\n00:01:06.095 --> 00:01:09.085\naccess other resources,\nprobably not gonna do us a whole lot\n\n27\n00:01:09.085 --> 00:01:10.030\nof good.\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n28\n00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.173\nI mean a lot of us are probably using\nthem to test different technologies and\n\n29\n00:01:14.173 --> 00:01:17.462\ndifferent software that's out\nthere that rely on, well,\n\n30\n00:01:17.462 --> 00:01:19.396\ncommunication in networking.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n31\n00:01:19.396 --> 00:01:23.270\nthere's gonna be times you spin\nup a machine and you wanna\n\n32\n00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.130\ntest something on that machine and\nit doesn't need to talk to anybody else.\n\n33\n00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.090\nBut if you're gonna spin up a domain\ncontroller on a DNA server for\n\n34\n00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.760\nlittle test lab, yeah,\ncommunication is key.\n\n35\n00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.510\nSo let's see how we do that in Hyper-V.\n\n36\n00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:36.563\nWhen we talk about networking in Hyper-V,\n\n37\n00:01:36.563 --> 00:01:40.590\nwhat we're gonna be doing is we're gonna\nbe creating virtual switches, all right.\n\n38\n00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.850\nAnd that's what Hyper-V's gonna call them.\n\n39\n00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:44.542\nIt's changed over the last few years, but\n\n40\n00:01:44.542 --> 00:01:46.379\nvirtual switches are what\nthey're known as.\n\n41\n00:01:46.379 --> 00:01:50.119\nAnd that's really what you're\ncreating is a switch, and\n\n42\n00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:55.320\nthen we're gonna plug our virtual\nmachines into those virtual switches.\n\n43\n00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.586\nAnd then depending on what else is\nplugged into that virtual switch is gonna\n\n44\n00:01:58.586 --> 00:02:01.850\ndetermine what that virtual\nmachine can communicate with.\n\n45\n00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.070\nWe have three different options\nwhen we go to create these virtual\n\n46\n00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:05.900\nswitches in Hyper-V.\n\n47\n00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:11.210\nWe've got what's known as private,\ninternal, and external.\n\n48\n00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:14.070\nAnd if we take a look at my screen here,\nI'm gonna jump out for\n\n49\n00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:17.530\na second and look at a drawing.\n\n50\n00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.600\nJust kind of let us visualize what's going\non with these different types of virtual\n\n51\n00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:22.520\nswitches.\n\n52\n00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.630\nSo the first one is gonna be\na private virtual switch.\n\n53\n00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.220\nAnd I'll try of kind of\nzoom in a little bit here.\n\n54\n00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:33.530\nWhen we look at a private virtual switch,\nI can connect virtual machines to that.\n\n55\n00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.370\nAnd those virtual machines can\ncommunicate with each other.\n\n56\n00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.740\nSo in this case VM1 can\ncommunicate with VM2.\n\n57\n00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:40.780\n&gt;&gt; Who else can they communicate\n\n58\n00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:41.670\nwith?\n&gt;&gt; That's\n\n59\n00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:42.470\nit.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n60\n00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:43.080\n&gt;&gt; Nobody,\n\n61\n00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.630\nthey're all isolated from everything else,\nright.\n\n62\n00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.300\nOf course we have access to them,\nwe can remote into them and manage them.\n\n63\n00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:51.990\nBut as far as their\nnetworking is concerned,\n\n64\n00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:53.870\nthey're isolated from everything else.\n\n65\n00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.880\nAnd this is a very common one to\nuse in a little test environment,\n\n66\n00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.990\nI'm spinning up a couple servers.\n\n67\n00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:02.040\nI don't want them going out and\ngetting updates,\n\n68\n00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.930\nI just wanna test a few things and\nI'm gonna blow them away.\n\n69\n00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.700\nOr maybe I'm doing work with researching\nmalware, something like that.\n\n70\n00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.300\nI don't wanna chance letting that thing\nout and exposing any other machines on my\n\n71\n00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:17.280\nnetwork, a private virtual switch\nwill isolate that traffic.\n\n72\n00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.910\nIt will only allow it-\n&gt;&gt; Ooh, you have a, what was it,\n\n73\n00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:21.240\nWorld War Z?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n74\n00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:22.510\n&gt;&gt; Brad Pitt,\n\n75\n00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.392\nan epidemic happened if that were to-\n&gt;&gt; I haven't seen it but it sounds good.\n\n76\n00:03:26.392 --> 00:03:29.620\n&gt;&gt; Okay, [LAUGH] zombies, Mike.\n\n77\n00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.680\n&gt;&gt; Zombies, yeah, zombies are always good.\n\n78\n00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.618\nSo that's a private switch.\n\n79\n00:03:34.618 --> 00:03:36.700\nThen we can also create an internal, and\n\n80\n00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.530\nit really just takes\nthe access one level up.\n\n81\n00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:45.120\nWith an internal virtual switch what we're\ngonna see is, just like with the private,\n\n82\n00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.180\nthe two VMs connected to that internal\nswitch can talk to each other.\n\n83\n00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.810\nBut you'll also see this\nlittle VNIC sitting out here.\n\n84\n00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.420\nAnd what's gonna happen is we're gonna\ncreate a virtual network adapter for\n\n85\n00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:59.190\nthe host machine to connect\nto that internal switch.\n\n86\n00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:03.990\nAnd so now the VMs can talk to each other\nbut they can also talk to the host and\n\n87\n00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:05.750\nthe host can talk to the VMs.\n\n88\n00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:10.780\nSo we can connect a shared folders,\nget DHCP, whatever the case my be.\n\n89\n00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:15.010\nSo there's communication between the VMs\nthemselves and between the VMs and\n\n90\n00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:16.070\nthe Hyper-V host.\n\n91\n00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:18.350\nI'll zoom back out.\n\n92\n00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:21.280\nThen of course we've got the last\none which is external, and\n\n93\n00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:24.008\nthe name pretty much tells us what we\nneed to know about this one, right.\n\n94\n00:04:24.008 --> 00:04:28.330\nThis is gonna give us access to\nthe external network, whatever that is,\n\n95\n00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.200\nwhatever the Hyper-V host is plugged into.\n\n96\n00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:31.180\nFor example,\n\n97\n00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:36.020\nhere my Hyper-V host is connected to\na LAN, which is routed out to the WAN.\n\n98\n00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:40.740\nSo when I connect my VMs to an external\nswitch, an external virtual switch,\n\n99\n00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:45.090\nthey can communicate with each other,\nthey can communicate with the host, and\n\n100\n00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:49.180\nthey can also communicate with whatever\nphysical network is out there.\n\n101\n00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:53.290\nSo if I was running DHCP on the physical\nnetwork, or my domain controller was out\n\n102\n00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:57.180\nthere on that physical network,\nthese VMs would be able to see it.\n\n103\n00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:01.508\nThey can receive DHCP, they can join the\ndomain, they can get group policy, right.\n\n104\n00:05:01.508 --> 00:05:05.130\nIt's just like they were plugged\ninto the physical network.\n\n105\n00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:06.210\nThey're gonna get a valid address and\n\n106\n00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:07.310\neverything.\n&gt;&gt; Cool, so\n\n107\n00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:11.225\nbasically what your saying is\nonce that binary leaves that\n\n108\n00:05:11.225 --> 00:05:16.125\nthose virtual machines and the host there,\nwe're talking about sending the binary\n\n109\n00:05:16.125 --> 00:05:19.015\non the physical wire through\nthat network interface card and\n\n110\n00:05:19.015 --> 00:05:21.205\non to the hardware.\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and\n\n111\n00:05:21.205 --> 00:05:23.790\nthis might not be technically correct\n\n112\n00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:27.070\nas far as just plugging the physical\nNIC into the external switch.\n\n113\n00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:30.020\nThere is a virtual network\nadapter that gets created,\n\n114\n00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:32.780\nit gets bound to your\nphysical network adapter.\n\n115\n00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:35.790\nSo this isn't a technically\ncorrect document-\n\n116\n00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:37.770\n&gt;&gt; But theoretically it represents, yeah,\n\n117\n00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:40.350\nhave that understanding and comprehension.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it helps us see the flow of\n\n118\n00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:45.330\ntraffic, and what those machines are gonna\nbe able to do connected to that network.\n\n119\n00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:51.010\nAnd you can do any combination of, I can\nhave more than one private virtual switch.\n\n120\n00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:53.490\nThese guys are isolated,\ncan only talk to each other.\n\n121\n00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:56.960\nBut maybe I need another little test lab\nthat should be isolated from them and\n\n122\n00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:58.200\nfrom everything else.\n\n123\n00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:02.150\nAnd I can just simply create another\nvirtual private switch, or private virtual\n\n124\n00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:05.690\nswitch, and connect virtual machines to\nthat and they could talk to each other.\n\n125\n00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:10.570\nIn this case, these two machines can talk\nto each other but not these two up here.\n\n126\n00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:14.330\nJust like in the physical world,\nthey're not connected to the same switch.\n\n127\n00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:15.920\nThose switches are not connected,\n\n128\n00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:17.740\ntherefore they're not gonna be\nable to talk to each other.\n\n129\n00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:20.760\nThere's no electrical\nconnectivity between those.\n\n130\n00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:22.880\nAnd the same thing when\nit comes to internal.\n\n131\n00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:27.860\nI can create as many internal networks\nas I need that would have access to\n\n132\n00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:31.845\nthe host machine as well as the VMs that\nare connected to that internal network.\n\n133\n00:06:31.845 --> 00:06:35.460\nIt'll create a virtual network adapter for\nthe host for\n\n134\n00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:41.912\neach one of the internal virtual switches\nthat you create and still have isolation.\n\n135\n00:06:41.912 --> 00:06:46.710\nThese VMs can't talk to these VM up here,\nright, but\n\n136\n00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:49.360\nthey can talk to each other and the host.\n\n137\n00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:51.220\nNow the difference is this external.\n\n138\n00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:53.410\nWhereas I can have as\nmany privates as I want,\n\n139\n00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:57.370\nI can have as many internal\nvirtual switches as I want,\n\n140\n00:06:57.370 --> 00:07:01.068\nexternal virtual switches have to be\nmapped to a physical network adapter.\n\n141\n00:07:01.068 --> 00:07:04.270\nSo you are limited by the number\nof physical adapters you have\n\n142\n00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:05.220\nin your machine.\n\n143\n00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:09.600\nI have one network adapter, I can only\ncreate one external virtual switch.\n\n144\n00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:11.250\nSo each external virtual network or\n\n145\n00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:15.060\neach external virtual switch has to be\nmapped to a physical network adapter.\n\n146\n00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:20.139\nAll right, so\nthat is the gist of the virtual networks.\n\n147\n00:07:20.139 --> 00:07:24.786\nNow let's see how we can go about creating\nthese and what we can do with them.\n\n148\n00:07:24.786 --> 00:07:27.235\nLet me make sure my machines\nare staying awake so\n\n149\n00:07:27.235 --> 00:07:30.500\nwe don't have to deal with\nthat in just a little bit.\n\n150\n00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:33.820\nWhat I've got here,\nI've got those two servers that we\n\n151\n00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:38.190\nmade in a previous episode that\nare based on the differencing disks.\n\n152\n00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:42.304\nSo I've got 2016diffo1,\n2016diffo2 are both up and\n\n153\n00:07:42.304 --> 00:07:47.176\nrunning All right, now, let's start by\nlooking at what we get out of the box\n\n154\n00:07:47.176 --> 00:07:50.390\nwith Hyper-B, Hyper-V, Hyper-B?\n&gt;&gt; That's\n\n155\n00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:53.109\nthe new version.\n&gt;&gt; That's the beta version they're coming\n\n156\n00:07:53.109 --> 00:07:54.232\nout with next year.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n157\n00:07:54.232 --> 00:07:55.407\n&gt;&gt; No, all right.\n\n158\n00:07:55.407 --> 00:08:00.726\nHyper-V is what we wanna talk about, and\nlet's see what we get out of the box.\n\n159\n00:08:00.726 --> 00:08:05.053\nIf we take a look at the network adapter\nor the yeah, the network adapters for\n\n160\n00:08:05.053 --> 00:08:08.635\nmy Hyper-V host,\nin this case my Windows 10 machine right,\n\n161\n00:08:08.635 --> 00:08:12.020\nI'm gonna see that I have\na couple of things in here.\n\n162\n00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:13.698\nBluetooth we're not worried about that.\n\n163\n00:08:13.698 --> 00:08:15.189\nI've got my ethernet adapter.\n\n164\n00:08:15.189 --> 00:08:19.477\nThat's my physical network adapter that's\nconnected to the local area network here\n\n165\n00:08:19.477 --> 00:08:20.317\nin our studios.\n\n166\n00:08:20.317 --> 00:08:23.763\nAnd then I've got this\nvEthernet (Default Switch).\n\n167\n00:08:23.763 --> 00:08:27.348\nNow this is relatively new to Hyper-V.\n\n168\n00:08:27.348 --> 00:08:30.248\nUsed to be you started out\nwith no virtual switches and\n\n169\n00:08:30.248 --> 00:08:34.280\nyou had to create them in order\nto network your virtual machines.\n\n170\n00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:39.270\nMicrosoft decided to give us a default\nvirtual switch, which again,\n\n171\n00:08:39.270 --> 00:08:41.770\nit's out of the box, already there.\n\n172\n00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:45.470\nIt provides Nat and DHCP.\n\n173\n00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:48.810\nSo I can actually plug machines\ninto this virtual switch and\n\n174\n00:08:48.810 --> 00:08:52.270\ngive them access to the local area\nnetwork without doing anything.\n\n175\n00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:54.170\nI just go to the machine and connect them.\n\n176\n00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:58.130\nI'll show you that towards the end because\nI really don't want to give my virtual\n\n177\n00:08:58.130 --> 00:08:59.910\nmachines internet access just yet.\n\n178\n00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:03.598\nI'm afraid they're gonna start doing\nWindows updates and kill my performance,\n\n179\n00:09:03.598 --> 00:09:06.014\nbecause we just spun them\nup in our previous episode.\n\n180\n00:09:06.014 --> 00:09:07.370\nAll right, let me zoom back out.\n\n181\n00:09:07.370 --> 00:09:09.247\nSo that's what we get by default, and\n\n182\n00:09:09.247 --> 00:09:12.658\nwe'll talk a little more about that\ndefault switch in just a minute.\n\n183\n00:09:12.658 --> 00:09:16.140\nBut I am gonna leave,\nactually let's leave that window open so\n\n184\n00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:17.660\nthat we can come back to it.\n\n185\n00:09:18.770 --> 00:09:23.570\nAll right, so to network your virtual\nmachines, when you look at the properties\n\n186\n00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:27.560\nof one of these VMs, I'm gonna right-click\non that VM and choose Settings.\n\n187\n00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:32.596\nAnd in here I've got my network adaptor,\nand I can see this is for Diff01,\n\n188\n00:09:32.596 --> 00:09:39.170\nall right, Diff01, and\nit is currently listed as not connected.\n\n189\n00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:40.330\nI hit this drop down list,\n\n190\n00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:44.770\nthe only choices I have are gonna\nbe Not connected or Default Switch.\n\n191\n00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:47.733\nThose are the only virtual switch,\nwell, I only have one,\n\n192\n00:09:47.733 --> 00:09:49.430\nthe one that came with Hyper-V.\n\n193\n00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:54.162\nIf we go take a look at the machine\nitself, the virtual machine, Diff01,\n\n194\n00:09:54.162 --> 00:09:57.930\nall right and we pull up,\nyou can see the red X down there, right?\n\n195\n00:09:57.930 --> 00:10:03.026\nIf I pull up those settings and\nwe take a look at our ethernet\n\n196\n00:10:03.026 --> 00:10:08.198\nadapter, I guess we can't\nthese in the properties.\n\n197\n00:10:08.198 --> 00:10:10.781\nWe can see that it is,\nindeed, disconnected, right?\n\n198\n00:10:10.781 --> 00:10:12.820\nNetwork cable unplugged.\n\n199\n00:10:14.270 --> 00:10:15.300\nAll right, so\n\n200\n00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:19.360\nwe wanna network this guy together we're\ngonna have to create some networks.\n\n201\n00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:20.020\nSo let's start.\n\n202\n00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:21.610\nI'm gonna close those settings.\n\n203\n00:10:21.610 --> 00:10:25.055\nOver here,\non the right hand side in my Actions pane,\n\n204\n00:10:25.055 --> 00:10:27.517\nI've got my Virtual Switch Manager.\n\n205\n00:10:27.517 --> 00:10:30.690\nThat's where we're gonna go to manage and\ncreate our virtual switches.\n\n206\n00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:35.590\nSo we go in here I've got my\nNew virtual switch option,\n\n207\n00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:40.070\nas well as Default Switch, the one that\ncame with Hyper-V, or was built in.\n\n208\n00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:42.510\nOver here I can see I've got\nthree different types, External,\n\n209\n00:10:42.510 --> 00:10:44.790\nInternal and Private.\n\n210\n00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:46.470\nAnd let's start with Private.\n\n211\n00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:49.270\nWe'll click Create virtual switch.\n\n212\n00:10:49.270 --> 00:10:51.750\nAnd I can see that the type\nis set to Private.\n\n213\n00:10:52.770 --> 00:10:55.760\nAnd I'm simply going to click Apply.\n\n214\n00:10:56.850 --> 00:10:59.385\nI'll zoom back out so\nwe can see the results here.\n\n215\n00:10:59.385 --> 00:11:01.138\nAnd you know what?\nI didn't even give it a decent name.\n\n216\n00:11:01.138 --> 00:11:02.825\nLet's change the name of that.\n\n217\n00:11:02.825 --> 00:11:07.289\nLet's call this one Private01.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n218\n00:11:07.289 --> 00:11:10.205\nyou're actually changing the name after\nyou've already created the switch so\n\n219\n00:11:10.205 --> 00:11:12.169\nwe know that that is possible.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.\n\n220\n00:11:12.169 --> 00:11:15.537\nYou can go back into any one of these\nswitches, except for the default, and\n\n221\n00:11:15.537 --> 00:11:19.067\nyou can make changes to the settings,\nswitch it between one type or the other,\n\n222\n00:11:19.067 --> 00:11:20.930\nrename it, things like that.\n\n223\n00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:23.840\nSo Private01 is created and\nwe'll click OK.\n\n224\n00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:28.894\nNow I'm gonna go over to the settings for\nDiff01.\n\n225\n00:11:31.554 --> 00:11:34.518\nAnd I'm gonna go down to Network Adapter,\nand\n\n226\n00:11:34.518 --> 00:11:37.680\nI'm just gonna choose Private01, right?\n\n227\n00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:41.097\nThere's that virtual\nswitch we just created.\n\n228\n00:11:41.097 --> 00:11:47.348\nSo I'll select that one, I'll zoom back\nout, and I'll click OK to apply it.\n\n229\n00:11:47.348 --> 00:11:49.694\nNow, if we go over to that machine,\n\n230\n00:11:49.694 --> 00:11:53.790\nyou can see that it's\nidentifying that network there.\n\n231\n00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:54.740\nIt's a little bit small.\n\n232\n00:11:54.740 --> 00:11:57.620\nThese VMs don't have the zooming\ntool added to it cuz\n\n233\n00:11:57.620 --> 00:12:00.270\nwe just spun them up\nin a previous episode.\n\n234\n00:12:00.270 --> 00:12:02.292\nBut it's trying to identify.\n\n235\n00:12:02.292 --> 00:12:06.811\nIf I pull up PowerShell, And\n\n236\n00:12:06.811 --> 00:12:13.348\nI do a little ipconfig,\nI'll see that I've got a 169.254 address.\n\n237\n00:12:13.348 --> 00:12:14.964\nAnd we all know what that is,\nright, Cherokee?\n\n238\n00:12:14.964 --> 00:12:15.783\n&gt;&gt; APIPA.\n\n239\n00:12:15.783 --> 00:12:17.784\n&gt;&gt; That is my private, my IP address,\n\n240\n00:12:17.784 --> 00:12:19.800\nAutomatic Private IP Addressing.\n\n241\n00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:22.910\nWhat that means is,\nI'm connected to a network.\n\n242\n00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:24.229\nI don't have an IP address.\n\n243\n00:12:24.229 --> 00:12:28.240\nAnd I'm trying to find a service\nthat can provide that information.\n\n244\n00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:30.940\nAnd I've been unsuccessful so far.\n\n245\n00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:34.180\nSo what should we take from this?\n\n246\n00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:37.502\nJust because you created a virtual switch\ndoes not mean it's gonna provide IP\n\n247\n00:12:37.502 --> 00:12:39.304\naddresses, and do NAT, and all of that.\n\n248\n00:12:39.304 --> 00:12:41.974\nIt's just like going and buying a switch-\n&gt;&gt; Hardware.\n\n249\n00:12:41.974 --> 00:12:43.041\n&gt;&gt; And pluging in a computer to it.\n\n250\n00:12:43.041 --> 00:12:47.128\nYeah, you've still got to go under your\nTCP/IP settings and configure that or\n\n251\n00:12:47.128 --> 00:12:51.940\nhave another machine connected to that\nswitch that is providing those services.\n\n252\n00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:56.823\nSo what we're gonna do is we're going\nto statically map some IP addresses.\n\n253\n00:12:56.823 --> 00:13:05.024\nSo I'm gonna pull up my adapter settings\non this Diff01, Properties, IPv4.\n\n254\n00:13:05.024 --> 00:13:08.862\nAnd I know it's a little small,\nI'm gonna be setting this to 10.10.1,\n\n255\n00:13:08.862 --> 00:13:11.052\nthis is client 01, so I'll call him 51.\n\n256\n00:13:13.271 --> 00:13:14.840\nAnd we should be good to go.\n\n257\n00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:20.300\nI'm not worried about gateways or\nDNS on this particular one.\n\n258\n00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:22.870\nAnd that's because, remember,\nthis is a private switch.\n\n259\n00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:25.513\nOnly the VMs I connect to it\nare gonna be able to communicate.\n\n260\n00:13:25.513 --> 00:13:27.932\nI don't have a DNS server on this network.\n\n261\n00:13:27.932 --> 00:13:29.905\nThere's no point in setting it.\n\n262\n00:13:29.905 --> 00:13:32.490\nAll right,\nnow if I go over to my PowerShell.\n\n263\n00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:37.860\nAnd just like a regular machine,\nright, my IP address is sitting there.\n\n264\n00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:39.305\nWe're good to go.\n\n265\n00:13:39.305 --> 00:13:43.899\nAll right, now let's go over here,\nor let's try this.\n\n266\n00:13:43.899 --> 00:13:47.547\nIf I go back to Diff01, I wanna ping,\n\n267\n00:13:51.361 --> 00:13:54.599\n10.10.1.52.\n\n268\n00:13:54.599 --> 00:13:58.057\nI know that doesn't make\na whole lot of sense, I guess.\n\n269\n00:13:58.057 --> 00:13:59.139\nThere's nobody else on this network.\n\n270\n00:13:59.139 --> 00:14:03.110\nI was gonna say, let's go ahead and ping\nthe other virtual machine to show you hey,\n\n271\n00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:04.598\nwe haven't connected it yet.\n\n272\n00:14:04.598 --> 00:14:05.836\nBut you guys are smarter than that.\n\n273\n00:14:05.836 --> 00:14:09.811\nSo we're just gonna go ahead and\njump over there and connect it real quick,\n\n274\n00:14:09.811 --> 00:14:11.210\nall right, so Diff02.\n\n275\n00:14:11.210 --> 00:14:15.600\nActually, I think I'll go\nthrough the console here.\n\n276\n00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:18.469\nI'm gonna pull up the setting for Diff02.\n\n277\n00:14:18.469 --> 00:14:21.121\nRemember, he's not connected, so\n\n278\n00:14:21.121 --> 00:14:26.350\nall I have to do is choose Private01 and\nclick OK to apply that, right?\n\n279\n00:14:28.190 --> 00:14:30.915\nNow go back over here to Diff02.\n\n280\n00:14:30.915 --> 00:14:33.084\nSame thing, though, right?\n&gt;&gt; Provide those IP settings?\n\n281\n00:14:33.084 --> 00:14:36.401\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, he has a network connection,\n\n282\n00:14:36.401 --> 00:14:42.490\nbut, I've got a APIPA because we\ndon't have a DHCP server running.\n\n283\n00:14:42.490 --> 00:14:47.266\nSo I'm gonna open up those\nNetwork Settings, And\n\n284\n00:14:47.266 --> 00:14:53.881\nwe will provide him manually,\nstatically, an IPv4 address.\n\n285\n00:14:53.881 --> 00:14:58.066\nSo let's do 10.10.1.52 for Client02,\n\n286\n00:14:58.066 --> 00:15:03.274\nput him on the same network with\nthe same subnet mask, OK, and OK.\n\n287\n00:15:03.274 --> 00:15:09.380\nAnd now, let's see if I can ping\n10.10.1.51, which was Diff01.\n\n288\n00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:14.650\nAnd sure enough,\nI'm getting replies, right?\n\n289\n00:15:14.650 --> 00:15:15.570\nSo everything is working.\n\n290\n00:15:15.570 --> 00:15:20.678\nIf we were to do the other thing,\nif we went the other way, all right,\n\n291\n00:15:20.678 --> 00:15:26.684\nwe come over here to Diff01 and\ntry to ping 10.10.1.52, all right?\n\n292\n00:15:26.684 --> 00:15:27.998\nAnd he's replying.\n\n293\n00:15:27.998 --> 00:15:29.883\nEverything is good.\n\n294\n00:15:29.883 --> 00:15:31.811\nSo we just networked our virtual machines.\n\n295\n00:15:31.811 --> 00:15:36.680\nThey can now talk to each other, we can do\ntests, whatever it is that we need to do.\n\n296\n00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:39.350\nBut what about connecting to the host or\nto outside?\n\n297\n00:15:40.970 --> 00:15:45.290\nNow the host address, I'm trying to\nthink of a best way to show you this.\n\n298\n00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:47.831\nIf we look at my Hyper-V host, right,\n\n299\n00:15:47.831 --> 00:15:51.297\nthe one that's hosting\nthese two virtual machines.\n\n300\n00:15:51.297 --> 00:15:57.018\nLet's open up PowerShell on this guy,\ndo an ipconfig.\n\n301\n00:15:57.018 --> 00:16:00.385\nAnd he's 10.10.8.51.\n\n302\n00:16:00.385 --> 00:16:05.641\nSo he's on a different network, but it\nreally doesn't matter because think about,\n\n303\n00:16:05.641 --> 00:16:10.313\ngo back to the drawings that I was showing\nyou guys, we made a private virtual\n\n304\n00:16:10.313 --> 00:16:16.260\nswitch, and let's just delete that guy, so\nthis is pretty much our setup right here.\n\n305\n00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:20.150\nRight, Dif 01 and Dif 02 are now\nconnected to a private virtual switch,\n\n306\n00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:23.070\nthey can communicate with each other,\nbut they can't go any further.\n\n307\n00:16:23.070 --> 00:16:24.560\nThey can't communicate with the host,\n\n308\n00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:28.560\nand they can't communicate\nwith the physical network.\n\n309\n00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:33.659\nAll right, so, and\neven if I tried to ping, like I said,\n\n310\n00:16:33.659 --> 00:16:36.100\nthe host machine is not even connected.\n\n311\n00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:39.614\nSo I don't even know what\naddress I would try to ping.\n\n312\n00:16:39.614 --> 00:16:43.720\nIt's not going to work, so that's private.\n\n313\n00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:49.740\nNow let's take a look\nat doing an internal.\n\n314\n00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:55.160\nSo let's create one first, so\nwe're gonna go to Virtual Switch Manager.\n\n315\n00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:59.290\nAnd again, gonna go through the same\nprocess, new virtual switch.\n\n316\n00:16:59.290 --> 00:17:05.020\nThis time I'm gonna choose internal and\nI'm gonna create Virtual Switch.\n\n317\n00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:10.776\nWe're gonna call this Internal01.\n\n318\n00:17:10.776 --> 00:17:13.112\nWe'll zoom out so\nI can find my Apply button,\n\n319\n00:17:13.112 --> 00:17:16.198\nI'm just gonna click OK to apply it and\nclose my dialog box.\n\n320\n00:17:18.461 --> 00:17:23.430\nAnd we now have a new network adapter,\nor I'm sorry, a new virtual switch.\n\n321\n00:17:23.430 --> 00:17:29.569\nSo I'm gonna go to Dif 01, pull up the\nsettings and I'm gonna change his network.\n\n322\n00:17:29.569 --> 00:17:31.979\nI'm gonna go to his properties, and\n\n323\n00:17:31.979 --> 00:17:37.210\nI'm just gonna go to the drop down list\nup here and change that to Internal01.\n\n324\n00:17:39.330 --> 00:17:45.711\nAnd we will zoom back out and\nwe'll make those changes.\n\n325\n00:17:45.711 --> 00:17:50.802\nSo now at this point, and this is where we\ngotta kinda keep track of what's going on,\n\n326\n00:17:50.802 --> 00:17:55.320\nyou might think well wait, an internal\nnetwork can communicate VM to VM and\n\n327\n00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:56.055\nVM to host.\n\n328\n00:17:56.055 --> 00:17:59.619\nA private network can\ncommunicate VM to VM.\n\n329\n00:17:59.619 --> 00:18:03.460\nShould these two virtual machines\nstill be able to talk to each other?\n\n330\n00:18:03.460 --> 00:18:08.280\nThey're both VMs, both of those types of\nnetworks allow VM to VM communication.\n\n331\n00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:09.230\nThe answer's absolutely not.\n\n332\n00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:15.110\nBecause even though they're\nstill not on the same network.\n\n333\n00:18:15.110 --> 00:18:17.980\nIf we go back out here,\n\n334\n00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:22.340\nthis is basically what I have now.\n&gt;&gt; And if you wanted\n\n335\n00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:25.750\nto have them be able to speak to each\nother, then all four of those would have\n\n336\n00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:29.200\nto connect to one of those switches.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n337\n00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:32.940\nI've got one machine connected to this\ninternal, which can talk to the host,\n\n338\n00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:34.170\nwe haven't tested that out.\n\n339\n00:18:34.170 --> 00:18:36.490\nBut the other machine is still\nconnected to private, and\n\n340\n00:18:36.490 --> 00:18:38.510\nthey're not connected to each other.\n\n341\n00:18:38.510 --> 00:18:43.870\nThis is an area I see some\npeople misunderstanding or\n\n342\n00:18:43.870 --> 00:18:45.020\ntrying to figure out what's going on.\n\n343\n00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:47.860\nThey'll make two private virtual switches.\n\n344\n00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:51.250\nThey'll connect each VM to its\nown private virtual switch and\n\n345\n00:18:51.250 --> 00:18:54.580\nexpect them to talk to each other,\nand it doesn't work that way.\n\n346\n00:18:54.580 --> 00:18:56.050\nThink of your physical switch.\n\n347\n00:18:56.050 --> 00:18:59.710\nIf I have two physical switches on\nmy desk and I plug two laptops,\n\n348\n00:18:59.710 --> 00:19:02.910\none into each one,\nthose laptops can't talk to each other.\n\n349\n00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:05.310\nIf I plug them both into the same switch,\n\n350\n00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:07.680\nall of a sudden they can\ntalk to each other, exactly.\n\n351\n00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:13.868\nSo let me undo that so we can save that\ndrawing for later and let's do this.\n\n352\n00:19:13.868 --> 00:19:19.486\nSo, Dif 01, I've already changed over to\nthat internal 01, now let's go to Dif 02,\n\n353\n00:19:22.109 --> 00:19:26.680\nAnd actually let's prove it first,\nour communication should have failed.\n\n354\n00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:29.999\nDif 01 can no longer\ncommunicate with Dif 02,\n\n355\n00:19:29.999 --> 00:19:33.800\nbecause they're connected\nto two different switches.\n\n356\n00:19:34.910 --> 00:19:37.498\nSo we're gonna go back over here and\n\n357\n00:19:37.498 --> 00:19:41.220\nchange Dif 02 to Internal 01,\nand click okay.\n\n358\n00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:44.510\nWell now they're both\nback to the same switch.\n\n359\n00:19:44.510 --> 00:19:47.620\nIt's a different switch type,\nit's internal versus private.\n\n360\n00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:50.759\nBut they are connected to the same switch,\nso can they communicate?\n\n361\n00:19:53.384 --> 00:19:57.375\nAnd the answer is absolutely, they can.\n\n362\n00:19:57.375 --> 00:20:00.955\nBut they should also be able to\ncommunicate with the host now because this\n\n363\n00:20:00.955 --> 00:20:01.680\nis an internal.\n\n364\n00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:02.555\n&gt;&gt; Internal.\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n365\n00:20:02.555 --> 00:20:03.345\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n366\n00:20:03.345 --> 00:20:04.875\n&gt;&gt; So let's see if we can do that.\n\n367\n00:20:04.875 --> 00:20:07.105\nBut here's where you gotta go,\n\n368\n00:20:07.105 --> 00:20:10.870\nhm, what is the IP address of my host?\n\n369\n00:20:10.870 --> 00:20:13.430\nWell let's see what's changed on the host.\n\n370\n00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:19.300\nIf we flip back out to my Hyper-V host by\nWindows 10 box and we open up our network\n\n371\n00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:23.500\nsettings, you'll see some things have\nchanged since we started playing around.\n\n372\n00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:27.360\nI still have my physical network adapter\nthat's connected to the external network,\n\n373\n00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:31.450\nthis is again the Hyper-V host, I have my\ndefault switch that Microsoft gives up\n\n374\n00:20:31.450 --> 00:20:34.530\nwhen we install Hyper-V,\nhere is my internal.\n\n375\n00:20:34.530 --> 00:20:38.610\nSo remember our drawing, I said that it\nwill create a virtual network adapter for\n\n376\n00:20:38.610 --> 00:20:41.920\nthe host machine and\nplug it in to that virtual switch so\n\n377\n00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:46.010\nthat it can now talk to those VMs and\nthe VMs can talk to the host.\n\n378\n00:20:46.010 --> 00:20:50.210\nBut just like any other network adapter,\nit still needs settings.\n\n379\n00:20:50.210 --> 00:20:54.650\nJust because it's connected to the switch,\nremember that switch is not providing\n\n380\n00:20:54.650 --> 00:20:57.340\nDHCP, it's not providing\nany of that information.\n\n381\n00:20:57.340 --> 00:21:02.200\nSo, yes my physical host has\na network adapter connected, but\n\n382\n00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:03.290\nit doesn't have an IP Address.\n\n383\n00:21:03.290 --> 00:21:08.005\nIn fact, if we do an IP config, here is\n\n384\n00:21:08.005 --> 00:21:13.378\nInternal01, and\nlook at what my IP address is.\n\n385\n00:21:13.378 --> 00:21:17.700\nIt’s a pippa, so just like the VMs I\ngot to go to my Hyper-V host,\n\n386\n00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:21.520\nmy Windows 10 machine and set\nthe properties on that network adapter or\n\n387\n00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:25.810\nprovide them some other way,\nprovide DHCP on this network.\n\n388\n00:21:25.810 --> 00:21:32.922\nSo let’s do that, let’s set this guy to\n10.10.1.50, put them on the same network.\n\n389\n00:21:35.337 --> 00:21:36.429\nAnd we should be good to go.\n\n390\n00:21:38.217 --> 00:21:39.308\nAll right, we'll click OK and OK.\n\n391\n00:21:41.247 --> 00:21:45.220\nAnd now we'll switch back over to Dif 01.\n\n392\n00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:46.900\nSo here I am again on Dif 01.\n\n393\n00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:51.997\nI'm gonna try to ping the host\nwhich we just set to 50,\n\n394\n00:21:51.997 --> 00:21:55.590\nand look it there, we are talking.\n\n395\n00:21:55.590 --> 00:21:59.360\nSo that's an internal virtual switch,\nit goes beyond the private.\n\n396\n00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:03.740\nIt says you can still communicate VM to\nVM, but now you can also communicate VM to\n\n397\n00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:07.500\nhost, and I could go to the host\nmachine and I could ping the VMs.\n\n398\n00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:10.809\nI could remote desktop into\nthose VMs from the host.\n\n399\n00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:14.370\nBut again,\nkeep in mind I'm saying from the host.\n\n400\n00:22:14.370 --> 00:22:17.309\nNothing beyond that physical machine\nbecause this does not connect us\n\n401\n00:22:17.309 --> 00:22:19.602\nto the physical.\n&gt;&gt; Not from my laptop if you were running\n\n402\n00:22:19.602 --> 00:22:21.397\nthem on yours.\n&gt;&gt; Exactly right.\n\n403\n00:22:21.397 --> 00:22:25.475\nAll right, so now let's take\na look at that third one then,\n\n404\n00:22:25.475 --> 00:22:28.690\nwhich is going to be our external type.\n\n405\n00:22:28.690 --> 00:22:32.420\nSo I'm going to go back over here\nto my virtual switch manager.\n\n406\n00:22:33.970 --> 00:22:35.560\nAnd we're going to go new virtual switch.\n\n407\n00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:40.310\nThis time I'm going to choose external and\ncreate virtual switch.\n\n408\n00:22:40.310 --> 00:22:43.540\nNow with the other two, we really\ndidn't have to worry about anything.\n\n409\n00:22:43.540 --> 00:22:47.470\nWhen we create a private and we create\ninternal didn't give us any choices,\n\n410\n00:22:47.470 --> 00:22:50.170\nthey are just radio buttons here.\n\n411\n00:22:50.170 --> 00:22:53.350\nWith external I get a drop-down list,\nand again,\n\n412\n00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:58.000\nthat's because an external virtual switch\nmaps to a physical network adapter.\n\n413\n00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:01.000\nI could have more than one physical\nnetwork adapter in my machine.\n\n414\n00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:04.280\nIt wants to know which one\nare you gonna map this particular\n\n415\n00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:06.350\nexternal virtual switch to?\n\n416\n00:23:06.350 --> 00:23:09.790\nI'm gonna pick the only one I've got,\nand so we're gonna stick with that and\n\n417\n00:23:09.790 --> 00:23:13.750\nI'm gonna call this one External01,\n\n418\n00:23:13.750 --> 00:23:16.930\nbecause I'm creative like that.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n419\n00:23:16.930 --> 00:23:18.470\n&gt;&gt; And we'll click okay.\n\n420\n00:23:18.470 --> 00:23:21.160\nNow, take a look at this\nmessage that pops up.\n\n421\n00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:25.062\nPending changes may disrupt\nnetwork connectivity, and\n\n422\n00:23:25.062 --> 00:23:29.904\nthis is because we're,\nBinding a virtual network\n\n423\n00:23:29.904 --> 00:23:34.110\nadapter that's gonna be created on my\nhost to that physical network adapter.\n\n424\n00:23:34.110 --> 00:23:38.150\nIt's gonna make some changes in the\nbackground to the way things are set up.\n\n425\n00:23:38.150 --> 00:23:42.110\nAnd I am gonna temporarily lose\nconnectivity on my Hyper-V host,\n\n426\n00:23:42.110 --> 00:23:46.232\nmy Windows 10 machine.\n&gt;&gt; So what you're saying is I should just\n\n427\n00:23:46.232 --> 00:23:49.282\nbe aware of that, for\nany kind of time sensitive services or\n\n428\n00:23:49.282 --> 00:23:52.834\napplications I have running?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, if you're running Hyper-V\n\n429\n00:23:52.834 --> 00:23:56.623\non Windows 10 you're probably using\nit as a test dev environment.\n\n430\n00:23:56.623 --> 00:23:59.056\nAnd it's probably not that big of a deal,\nbut\n\n431\n00:23:59.056 --> 00:24:01.241\nit is something I want you to be aware of.\n\n432\n00:24:01.241 --> 00:24:05.970\nLet's say that my laptop\nwas providing some service.\n\n433\n00:24:05.970 --> 00:24:08.510\nOr let's say Cherokee was in the middle,\nI said,\n\n434\n00:24:08.510 --> 00:24:11.010\nhey I got these files that you can have.\n\n435\n00:24:11.010 --> 00:24:14.000\nAnd so she's connected to\na share on my laptop, and\n\n436\n00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.060\nshe's copying those files over.\n\n437\n00:24:16.060 --> 00:24:19.210\nWell while that's going on, I decide\nto create a new external switch, and\n\n438\n00:24:19.210 --> 00:24:20.950\nbind it to my network adapter.\n\n439\n00:24:20.950 --> 00:24:23.240\nIt's going to drop that connection, right?\n\n440\n00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:27.250\nShe's gonna lose connectivity,\nand that file copy is gonna fail.\n\n441\n00:24:27.250 --> 00:24:29.904\nIf this was a production Hyper-V server,\n\n442\n00:24:29.904 --> 00:24:33.009\nI probably am providing\nservices to the network.\n\n443\n00:24:33.009 --> 00:24:36.450\nAnd I'm not gonna wanna,\nmaybe I do, maybe I don't, right?\n\n444\n00:24:36.450 --> 00:24:38.460\nThis is something that\nyou would have to decide.\n\n445\n00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:41.760\nI just wanna make sure that you're aware,\nwhen you do this,\n\n446\n00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:44.580\nit will temporarily interrupt\nyour network connectivity.\n\n447\n00:24:44.580 --> 00:24:45.830\nIn fact, you might see it,\n\n448\n00:24:45.830 --> 00:24:48.989\nI'll zoom back out.\n&gt;&gt; It's nice that they're giving us this\n\n449\n00:24:48.989 --> 00:24:49.812\nmessage here.\n\n450\n00:24:49.812 --> 00:24:53.092\nI can't remember in PowerShell\nif you're doing this,\n\n451\n00:24:53.092 --> 00:24:55.410\nif it will give you that warning or not.\n\n452\n00:24:55.410 --> 00:24:58.183\nSo just a heads up that\nit it will disrupt.\n\n453\n00:24:58.183 --> 00:25:01.390\nEven if you don't get that notification,\nyou're creating one in PowerShell.\n\n454\n00:25:01.390 --> 00:25:02.419\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and\n\n455\n00:25:02.419 --> 00:25:08.268\nwatch down here as my network icon for\nmy laptop, my Hyper-V host, if I hit Yes.\n\n456\n00:25:10.544 --> 00:25:11.819\nSee if we notice it,\n\n457\n00:25:11.819 --> 00:25:16.910\nsee how that little yellow\nexclamation point came up down there?\n\n458\n00:25:16.910 --> 00:25:21.500\nI lost network connectivity, now it's\ngone, and network connectivity is back, so\n\n459\n00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:22.260\nit's really quick.\n\n460\n00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:27.210\nI mean it's not something that's going\nto bring my system down for a long time.\n\n461\n00:25:27.210 --> 00:25:29.790\nBut again,\nif you're providing important services,\n\n462\n00:25:29.790 --> 00:25:32.530\nsomebody's connected to your machine for\nother reasons.\n\n463\n00:25:32.530 --> 00:25:33.918\nIt's just something that\nyou've got to be aware of.\n\n464\n00:25:33.918 --> 00:25:37.076\nAnd if it's a production server, like\nwe are getting into our server classes,\n\n465\n00:25:37.076 --> 00:25:39.317\ndefinitely it's something\nwe're gonna think about.\n\n466\n00:25:39.317 --> 00:25:43.418\nOne of the reasons Microsoft gives\nus that default switch now, is for\n\n467\n00:25:43.418 --> 00:25:44.559\nthat very reason.\n\n468\n00:25:44.559 --> 00:25:48.430\nBecause they create that default\nswitch during the installation, and\n\n469\n00:25:48.430 --> 00:25:51.590\nHyper-V installation\nalready requires a reboot.\n\n470\n00:25:51.590 --> 00:25:53.060\nSo there's gonna be service interruption.\n\n471\n00:25:53.060 --> 00:25:56.254\nSo during that interruption, it goes\nahead and makes that default switch.\n\n472\n00:25:56.254 --> 00:26:00.830\nAnd you can use it without ever having\nto bring your network adapter down, so\n\n473\n00:26:00.830 --> 00:26:02.200\nthat's kind of nice.\n\n474\n00:26:03.470 --> 00:26:08.410\nAll right, so we've created an external\nnow let's connect our virtual machine.\n\n475\n00:26:08.410 --> 00:26:12.315\nActually, before we do that, let's\nsee what happened to my Hyper-V host,\n\n476\n00:26:12.315 --> 00:26:15.010\ncuz this can get confusing as well.\n\n477\n00:26:15.010 --> 00:26:18.410\nI'm gonna flip back over to my network\nadapters, again, I'm on the Hyper-V host,\n\n478\n00:26:18.410 --> 00:26:19.910\nmy Windows 10 box.\n\n479\n00:26:19.910 --> 00:26:22.940\nAnd I can see, I still have my physical,\n\n480\n00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:26.350\nmy default,\nI have the internal that we created.\n\n481\n00:26:26.350 --> 00:26:30.900\nThere is no representation for\nprivate, but we know why, right?\n\n482\n00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:33.359\nBecause host machines don't\ntalk to private networks.\n\n483\n00:26:33.359 --> 00:26:35.125\nPrivates are VM to VM only, so\n\n484\n00:26:35.125 --> 00:26:39.880\nthere is no need to represent anything\nin my host machine's network adapters.\n\n485\n00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:44.184\nInternal allows VM to VM, VM to host,\nso there is a representation.\n\n486\n00:26:44.184 --> 00:26:47.086\nI have to be able to give it\nan IP address that's valid, so\n\n487\n00:26:47.086 --> 00:26:49.340\nthat it can talk to\nthose virtual machines.\n\n488\n00:26:49.340 --> 00:26:52.476\nNow I've got external, but\nhere's the interesting thing, right?\n\n489\n00:26:52.476 --> 00:26:57.236\nWe created External01,\nnotice it says lab.itpro.tv.\n\n490\n00:26:57.236 --> 00:27:02.140\nAnd my physical network adapter,\nEthernet0, now it just says enabled.\n\n491\n00:27:02.140 --> 00:27:06.187\nNo longer says lab.itpro.tv,\nthe network that it's connected to.\n\n492\n00:27:06.187 --> 00:27:10.051\nIf we take a look at the properties\nof my physical network adapter,\n\n493\n00:27:10.051 --> 00:27:11.710\nit's gonna look kinda odd.\n\n494\n00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:13.290\nNotice that,\n\n495\n00:27:13.290 --> 00:27:18.070\nwait, what do you mean IPv4 is no longer\nbound to this network adapter, right?\n\n496\n00:27:18.070 --> 00:27:21.170\nIPv6 is no longer bound\nto this network adapter.\n\n497\n00:27:21.170 --> 00:27:24.880\nOnly thing I see is this\nHyper-V Extensible Virtual Switch.\n\n498\n00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:27.040\nThis is the mapping that occurs, and\n\n499\n00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:30.040\nthis is why we temporarily\nlose network connectivity.\n\n500\n00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:33.708\nIf I take a look at this virtual switch,\nExternal01,\n\n501\n00:27:33.708 --> 00:27:39.261\nit now contains all of the properties that\nmy physical network adapter used to have.\n\n502\n00:27:39.261 --> 00:27:42.026\nThey all just got\ntransferred over to here,\n\n503\n00:27:42.026 --> 00:27:45.996\nthat's the mapping that occurs\nwhen we create that external.\n\n504\n00:27:45.996 --> 00:27:51.261\nAnd so now,\nmy External01 has the IPv4 address for\n\n505\n00:27:51.261 --> 00:27:55.125\nmy physical network adapter, right?\n\n506\n00:27:55.125 --> 00:27:56.623\nSo again, that gets a little confusing.\n\n507\n00:27:56.623 --> 00:28:00.275\nIf you wanted to change your\nhost machine's IPv4 address, and\n\n508\n00:28:00.275 --> 00:28:03.360\nyou go to your network\nadapter's properties.\n\n509\n00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:06.300\nAnd you're like wait, what,\nwhy is this unchecked?\n\n510\n00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:06.870\nWhat's going on?\n\n511\n00:28:06.870 --> 00:28:09.440\nI can't pull up the properties for IPv4.\n\n512\n00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:14.060\nThis is why, all right, so\nit does get a little confusing at first.\n\n513\n00:28:14.060 --> 00:28:19.839\nAll right, now let's switch our VMs,\nso I'm gonna pull up the settings for\n\n514\n00:28:19.839 --> 00:28:25.180\nDIFF01 and we're gonna change it\nto External, and I'll click OK.\n\n515\n00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:31.410\nAnd I'll go ahead in DIFF02,\nsame thing, I'm gonna go to Settings\n\n516\n00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:38.290\nand Internal to External, okay.\n\n517\n00:28:38.290 --> 00:28:43.480\nSo now they're connected, they should have\naccess to each other, to the host, and\n\n518\n00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:45.520\nnow to the external network.\n\n519\n00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:49.030\nWhatever my host is connected to,\nwe think, right?\n\n520\n00:28:49.030 --> 00:28:50.870\nLet's go check it out and see.\n\n521\n00:28:50.870 --> 00:28:55.343\nIf I go back over to DIFF01, and\nlet's do what we already know works,\n\n522\n00:28:55.343 --> 00:28:56.847\nwe'll ping DIFF02.\n\n523\n00:28:58.463 --> 00:29:05.021\nOkay, that works,\nlet's try to ping the Hyper-V host.\n\n524\n00:29:07.761 --> 00:29:09.140\nIt's not working,\n\n525\n00:29:09.140 --> 00:29:12.321\nDestination host unreachable.\n&gt;&gt; I thought we were\n\n526\n00:29:12.321 --> 00:29:13.463\nsupposed to be able to reach the host.\n\n527\n00:29:13.463 --> 00:29:15.968\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we should be able to talk to VMs,\n\n528\n00:29:15.968 --> 00:29:18.790\nthe host, and the outside world.\n&gt;&gt; Potentially even the internet,\n\n529\n00:29:18.790 --> 00:29:19.625\nyeah.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n530\n00:29:19.625 --> 00:29:24.224\nmy Hyper-V host has internet access,\nso I should be able to ping\n\n531\n00:29:24.224 --> 00:29:29.650\nsomething like 4.2.2.1,\nand I'm getting nada, why?\n\n532\n00:29:29.650 --> 00:29:34.362\nBecause remember, we statically mapped\nour IP configuration to work on\n\n533\n00:29:34.362 --> 00:29:38.545\nthat internal switch 10.10.1,\nand then their host ID.\n\n534\n00:29:38.545 --> 00:29:41.558\nWell, now I'm connecting to\nthe physical network, and\n\n535\n00:29:41.558 --> 00:29:44.680\nour network here at ITProTV\nis not using 10.10.1.\n\n536\n00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:48.110\nIt's not a valid network\naddress on this network,\n\n537\n00:29:48.110 --> 00:29:50.980\nbut we are running DHCP on our network.\n\n538\n00:29:50.980 --> 00:29:55.020\nSo let's see if we can fix this, change\nadapter, we're just going to come in here.\n\n539\n00:29:55.020 --> 00:30:00.840\nProperties, IPv4, and let's just\nobtain everything automatically.\n\n540\n00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:02.158\nI know I did that really quick,\n\n541\n00:30:02.158 --> 00:30:05.970\nhopefully everybody is very familiar\nwith setting up your TCP/IP settings.\n\n542\n00:30:05.970 --> 00:30:07.490\nAnd look at there,\n\n543\n00:30:07.490 --> 00:30:11.240\nas soon as I did that it's saying\nyou're connected to a new network.\n\n544\n00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:13.500\nDo you want to make it public or private?\n\n545\n00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:15.196\nWell, we'll go ahead and\nmake it private, I'll say Yes.\n\n546\n00:30:18.392 --> 00:30:21.500\nAnd now we'll go over here, and\n\n547\n00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:26.576\nI'm gonna ping the Hyper-V host 10.10.8.\n\n548\n00:30:26.576 --> 00:30:31.848\nI forgot what his IP\naddress was doggone it,\n\n549\n00:30:31.848 --> 00:30:37.129\nHyper-V host was 10.10.8.51.\n\n550\n00:30:37.129 --> 00:30:38.825\nNotice I'm not looking at internal,\n\n551\n00:30:38.825 --> 00:30:41.590\nI'm not connected to\nthe internal switch anymore.\n\n552\n00:30:41.590 --> 00:30:46.380\nI'm connected to the external switch,\nwhich is mapped to Ethernet here.\n\n553\n00:30:46.380 --> 00:30:50.500\nActually, you know what I'll do,\nlet me do this, ipconfig, again.\n\n554\n00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:52.050\nBecause remember what happened,\n\n555\n00:30:52.050 --> 00:30:56.510\nmy physical network adapter\nisn't even listed here anymore.\n\n556\n00:30:57.710 --> 00:31:04.680\nBut External01 is, and that's got that\nIP address, so let's go back to diff 01.\n\n557\n00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:08.190\nAnd it just blew up in\nthe middle of my demo,\n\n558\n00:31:08.190 --> 00:31:10.880\nthat's never good, let's try that again.\n\n559\n00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:16.470\nJust a little graphics rendering\nissue as I flip between VMs.\n\n560\n00:31:16.470 --> 00:31:24.577\nSo 10.10.8.51.\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\n\n561\n00:31:24.577 --> 00:31:25.740\n&gt;&gt; And look, there I go.\n\n562\n00:31:25.740 --> 00:31:28.750\nWell that means I must have\ngot an IP address somehow.\n\n563\n00:31:31.350 --> 00:31:35.810\nAnd my virtual machine has picked up\nan IP address from the physical network.\n\n564\n00:31:35.810 --> 00:31:38.460\nBecause I connected to that external\nnetwork which has access to\n\n565\n00:31:38.460 --> 00:31:43.060\nall the resources on whatever network\nthe Hyper-V host is connected to.\n\n566\n00:31:43.060 --> 00:31:45.974\nIn fact my Hyper-V host\nhas internet access, so\n\n567\n00:31:45.974 --> 00:31:50.106\nI should be able to ping all the way\nto Atlanta or wherever that guy is.\n\n568\n00:31:50.106 --> 00:31:53.802\nI forget, somewhere up there.\n\n569\n00:31:53.802 --> 00:31:57.270\nLittle bit slow as it gets\nrouted through there.\n\n570\n00:31:57.270 --> 00:31:58.657\nThis is my virtual machine.\n\n571\n00:31:58.657 --> 00:32:02.991\nSo this is what I was afraid of earlier,\nas soon as I gave this guy external\n\n572\n00:32:02.991 --> 00:32:06.800\naccess, it's reaching out and\nit's doing Windows updates.\n\n573\n00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:10.920\nSo you can see it type,\nI'm not typing, right, it's slowly.\n\n574\n00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:11.810\n&gt;&gt; It's just that slow [LAUGH].\n\n575\n00:32:11.810 --> 00:32:14.600\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm gonna kill that, and\n\n576\n00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:16.890\nI'm just gonna take it off of\nthe external network real quick,\n\n577\n00:32:16.890 --> 00:32:19.480\nwhich is really gonna make it angry.\n\n578\n00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:23.450\nBut performance is just not\ngonna be worth it here.\n\n579\n00:32:23.450 --> 00:32:26.790\nSo let's bump him back to,\ncuz I think we proved it, right?\n\n580\n00:32:26.790 --> 00:32:30.930\nI was able to ping the host,\nI was able to get DHCP, so\n\n581\n00:32:30.930 --> 00:32:33.150\nyou know I'm connected\nto the physical network.\n\n582\n00:32:33.150 --> 00:32:36.041\nWell, in fact, I'm getting Windows\nupdates, so I must be connected\n\n583\n00:32:36.041 --> 00:32:38.082\nto the physical network, right?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's true.\n\n584\n00:32:38.082 --> 00:32:42.516\nWell, Mike, we've seen internal,\nexternal, and private.\n\n585\n00:32:42.516 --> 00:32:45.140\nAnything else we need to\nknow about in this show?\n\n586\n00:32:45.140 --> 00:32:46.650\n&gt;&gt; The only other one would be that\n\n587\n00:32:46.650 --> 00:32:47.350\ndefault.\n\n588\n00:32:47.350 --> 00:32:49.840\nAnd since this guy's already going out and\ndoing updates,\n\n589\n00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:51.770\nI might as well go ahead and\nconnect him now.\n\n590\n00:32:51.770 --> 00:32:53.300\nSo let's go back to the settings of Dif01.\n\n591\n00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:57.960\nAnd we're gonna change\nthis to Default Switch.\n\n592\n00:32:57.960 --> 00:33:01.867\nThat's the prebuilt one\nthat comes with Hyper-V.\n\n593\n00:33:01.867 --> 00:33:03.359\nSo I'll choose that, and I'll click OK.\n\n594\n00:33:03.359 --> 00:33:07.983\nAnd now we're gonna go back over to Dif01.\n\n595\n00:33:07.983 --> 00:33:10.050\nAnd give it a second, it's thinking.\n\n596\n00:33:12.460 --> 00:33:13.940\nAnd now let's do an ipconfig.\n\n597\n00:33:15.670 --> 00:33:18.761\nAnd looks like I'm still at 10.10.8.74.\n\n598\n00:33:18.761 --> 00:33:22.776\nSo let's do an ipconfig /release.\n\n599\n00:33:25.710 --> 00:33:28.672\nAnd then we'll do a little /renew.\n\n600\n00:33:32.684 --> 00:33:33.680\nAnd let's see what happens.\n\n601\n00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:37.877\nLook, I'm connected to new network\nthat it's never seen before.\n\n602\n00:33:37.877 --> 00:33:39.342\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nmark it as private, but\n\n603\n00:33:39.342 --> 00:33:40.395\nhere's what I wanted to show you.\n\n604\n00:33:40.395 --> 00:33:47.770\nLook at my IP Address, 172.26.164.\n\n605\n00:33:47.770 --> 00:33:53.210\nSo that's the network address\nassigned to that Default Switch.\n\n606\n00:33:53.210 --> 00:33:56.970\nIt's providing DHCP,\nit's also providing net.\n\n607\n00:33:56.970 --> 00:34:04.120\nI should be able to ping Something\noutside, and look, I'm replying just fine.\n\n608\n00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:07.440\nIn fact it's gonna start doing its\nWindows updates here in just a second.\n\n609\n00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:09.511\nSo the Default Switch works fine, right?\n\n610\n00:34:09.511 --> 00:34:11.387\nIt does exactly what it needs to do,\n\n611\n00:34:11.387 --> 00:34:14.470\nit gives me access to\nthe external physical network.\n\n612\n00:34:14.470 --> 00:34:19.540\nIt provides DHCP, and\nit provides network address translation.\n\n613\n00:34:19.540 --> 00:34:23.990\nThe one thing you can't do with that\nis make a lot of changes to it, right?\n\n614\n00:34:23.990 --> 00:34:27.870\nIf I go back over to my network adapters\nhere and I pull up the properties for\n\n615\n00:34:27.870 --> 00:34:32.030\nthis Default Switch,\nI can come in here and I can set these.\n\n616\n00:34:32.030 --> 00:34:36.500\nI haven't tried this, but I was reading\nan interesting article on Microsoft.\n\n617\n00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:41.060\nSomebody was saying if you delete it,\nit will come back.\n\n618\n00:34:41.060 --> 00:34:45.467\nI don't know if that's true, but\nit might be something you want to look at.\n\n619\n00:34:45.467 --> 00:34:46.745\n&gt;&gt; Test.\n\n620\n00:34:46.745 --> 00:34:49.540\n&gt;&gt; So yeah, Cherokee, I think that's good.\n\n621\n00:34:49.540 --> 00:34:53.750\nI think we got to see all of our\noptions when it comes to networking.\n\n622\n00:34:53.750 --> 00:34:56.930\nThe key take away here is just\nremember those names, right?\n\n623\n00:34:56.930 --> 00:34:58.910\nPrivate is VM to VM.\n\n624\n00:34:58.910 --> 00:35:02.470\nInternal is going to be VM to VM,\nVM to host.\n\n625\n00:35:02.470 --> 00:35:06.220\nAnd then external is going to be VM to VM,\nVM to host,\n\n626\n00:35:06.220 --> 00:35:09.870\nand VM to external network,\nwhatever that might be.\n\n627\n00:35:09.870 --> 00:35:12.838\nAnd notice I keep saying\nexternal network and not WAN.\n\n628\n00:35:12.838 --> 00:35:16.158\nIf my Hyper-V host is not\nconnected to the WAN,\n\n629\n00:35:16.158 --> 00:35:20.806\nthen even if I connect a virtual\nmachine on that host to the external\n\n630\n00:35:20.806 --> 00:35:24.717\nnetwork adapter,\nit's not gonna make it out, right?\n\n631\n00:35:24.717 --> 00:35:27.653\nIt has to have that\nconnectivity somewhere,\n\n632\n00:35:27.653 --> 00:35:29.900\nso just something to think about.\n\n633\n00:35:29.900 --> 00:35:33.080\nBut that, my friends,\nis networking in Hyper-V.\n\n634\n00:35:33.080 --> 00:35:34.010\n&gt;&gt; Awesome, Mike, thank you so\n\n635\n00:35:34.010 --> 00:35:34.590\nmuch for that.\n\n636\n00:35:34.590 --> 00:35:38.240\nAnd thank you for joining us as well,\nbut we are out of time for this episode.\n\n637\n00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:40.680\nAnd I'll sign out.\nI've been your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n638\n00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:41.191\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n639\n00:35:41.191 --> 00:35:42.530\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITPro.TV.\n\n640\n00:35:42.530 --> 00:35:45.979\n[MUSIC]\n\n641\n00:35:45.979 --> 00:35:51.880\n&gt;&gt; Thank you

series,\nstudying for that 70-697.\n\n6\n00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.190\nI'm your host Cherokee Boose,\nand in this episode,\n\n7\n00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:23.750\nwe'll be taking a look at how\nto configure mobility options.\n\n8\n00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.675\nWe are always on the go, go, go, so I'm\nreally looking forward to seeing what Mr.\n\n9\n00:00:27.675 --> 00:00:31.180\nMike Rodrick has in store for us,\nfor the show, how's it going, Mike?\n\n10\n00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:32.672\n&gt;&gt; It's going great, Cherokee, thanks for\n\n11\n00:00:32.672 --> 00:00:35.390\nhaving me, and yeah,\nwe've got mobility options, as you said.\n\n12\n00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:36.865\nAlways on the go, right.\n&gt;&gt; Right [LAUGH].\n\n13\n00:00:36.865 --> 00:00:38.474\n&gt;&gt; So we're gonna start off with,\n\n14\n00:00:38.474 --> 00:00:41.515\nwe've got a bunch of mobility\noptions we wanna go through for\n\n15\n00:00:41.515 --> 00:00:44.160\nthis particular exam and\ntheir listed objectives.\n\n16\n00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.060\nWe're gonna start off with a classic,\none known as offline files,\n\n17\n00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:52.840\nan oldie but a goodie, so\nthat is where we will begin.\n\n18\n00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.950\nWhen we think about offline files,\nfirst thing we have to realize is,\n\n19\n00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:59.390\noffline files has been around for\na long time, a really long time.\n\n20\n00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:04.220\nWe go way back, I was trying to think,\nit's well before XP, 2003,\n\n21\n00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.470\nI think, but somewhere way back there.\n\n22\n00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.470\nThe point I'm trying to make is it's\nnot important when it came about,\n\n23\n00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.400\nit's the fact that it is an older\ntechnology still supported.\n\n24\n00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.870\nIt is still useful, but\nthere's a lot of other ways that\n\n25\n00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:24.180\nwe can do this same kind\nof thing with the cloud,\n\n26\n00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.700\ncloud storage, the OneDrives,\nthings like that.\n\n27\n00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.470\nReally have taken a forefront and kind\nof moved offline files out of the way.\n\n28\n00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.020\nAnd that's why you see when\nyou get into Windows 10,\n\n29\n00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.810\nlooking for offline files settings is\ndifficult, trying to find where it is.\n\n30\n00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.575\nBecause again, it's one of those legacy\ntechnologies that's just around.\n\n31\n00:01:45.575 --> 00:01:48.710\nBut there's other ways they really\nwant you to do things nowadays.\n\n32\n00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:49.660\n&gt;&gt; For sure, I mean, Mike, and\n\n33\n00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:54.780\nyou know this, looking at objectives for\nserverside exams with Microsoft.\n\n34\n00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.890\nThey still call out things like how to\nset up and manage work folders, and\n\n35\n00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.930\nlike you're saying, offline files.\n\n36\n00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.850\nThese are things that have been existing\nfor a long time, but we look at even cloud\n\n37\n00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.820\nsolutions, our OneDrive options here\nare really kind of pushing these\n\n38\n00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:15.023\nolder technologies out of the way, right?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely, and so\n\n39\n00:02:15.023 --> 00:02:17.885\nwe'll focus in again on offline files.\n\n40\n00:02:17.885 --> 00:02:20.183\nAnd let's talk about what\nthe heck it is first, and\n\n41\n00:02:20.183 --> 00:02:22.405\nthen we can kinda talk about why-\n&gt;&gt; The history, okay.\n\n42\n00:02:22.405 --> 00:02:24.042\n&gt;&gt; We don't see it as much anymore, yeah.\n\n43\n00:02:24.042 --> 00:02:25.824\nAnd we'll do some demos\non how to set it up.\n\n44\n00:02:25.824 --> 00:02:30.600\nCuz like I said, it is still or can be\nuseful, and it is on the exam, exactly.\n\n45\n00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:31.520\nSo I'll find files, and\n\n46\n00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.390\nwhen we go into our corporate work space,\nour corporate network, we connect.\n\n47\n00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.890\nThere's a lot of resources that\nare available to us on the network.\n\n48\n00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.450\nAnd we have file servers that host file\nshares and we have to access documents up\n\n49\n00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.210\nthere, work with documents that are up\nthere on those shared locations.\n\n50\n00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:50.160\nWe might create files or\nfiles that we're working with,\n\n51\n00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.190\nwe want to store them up\nthere in the network.\n\n52\n00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:53.490\nBecause our IT department has said,\n\n53\n00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:57.500\nhey, don't store anything local, because\nwe don't back up your local machines.\n\n54\n00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.100\nAnything that's important\nmust be kept in a file share,\n\n55\n00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:04.040\nwe back up our file servers every night,\nthat way your data's safe.\n\n56\n00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.870\nWhich is all well and good cuz I can\naccess it from any computer, we can access\n\n57\n00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.900\nthose shares when we're on the network,\nbut what about when I go home?\n\n58\n00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.550\nWhat about when I go off for lunch and\nI'm sitting out at the park?\n\n59\n00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:19.360\nOr we don't have wireless coverage\nout across the entire campus?\n\n60\n00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.380\nHow can I continue to work\nwith those documents?\n\n61\n00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:26.290\nAnd the answer is, I really can't, right,\nnot with those network copies, anyway.\n\n62\n00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:32.450\nSo our solution was to copy that file\ndown to the local machine, go home.\n\n63\n00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:35.138\nI can now work with that\ndocument while I was home.\n\n64\n00:03:35.138 --> 00:03:38.490\nBut now I've got a second version or\na different copy of that document.\n\n65\n00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:42.061\nSo when I get back to work,\nnow I've got to remember to,\n\n66\n00:03:42.061 --> 00:03:45.632\nupload my copy of this document and\nreplace that older copy so\n\n67\n00:03:45.632 --> 00:03:49.151\nthat we have a latest version or\nthe one with all my changes.\n\n68\n00:03:49.151 --> 00:03:52.894\nAnd that was just tedious and\nnot very intuitive, especially for\n\n69\n00:03:52.894 --> 00:03:55.230\nusers that are not IT people, right.\n\n70\n00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:59.490\nThey don't deal with this all the time,\nso that's where offline files came in.\n\n71\n00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:05.330\nOffline files gives me the ability to\ncache shared files, files that are put\n\n72\n00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:10.230\nin shared folders upon the network,\nto cache them locally on my drive.\n\n73\n00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:11.490\nAnd now when I go home or\n\n74\n00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:16.120\nI leave the corporate network,\nI can work with those cached copies.\n\n75\n00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.610\nAnd when I plug back into the network\nthe next day or later that afternoon or\n\n76\n00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:25.690\nwhenever, it'll automatically synchronize\nmy changes with that original document.\n\n77\n00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:29.620\nSo no more of this worrying about\nwhich one is the latest version,\n\n78\n00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.490\nI just simply work with\nthe document offline.\n\n79\n00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:36.060\nWhen I get back in, it's gonna\nsynchronize those changes for me, so\n\n80\n00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.885\nthat's the idea behind offline files.\n\n81\n00:04:38.885 --> 00:04:46.440\nThere's some pros and cons to this\nprocess that we'll talk about as we go.\n\n82\n00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:49.450\nSo why don't we just go ahead and\n\n83\n00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:52.900\nstart by taking a look at how\nto configure offline files?\n\n84\n00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:55.070\nAll right, so\nlet's take a look at my screen here, and\n\n85\n00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:58.140\nI'm on my Windows 10 machine\nthat's part of my domain.\n\n86\n00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:00.870\nAnd on a server on my network,\nthere is a shared folder.\n\n87\n00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:06.470\nSo if I go into dc03/Docs, right,\nand I'll zoom in here, right?\n\n88\n00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:10.530\nI'm just connecting to a shared folder,\nso nothing too exciting there.\n\n89\n00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:15.230\nAnd when I get into that shared folder, I\ncan see there's some documents available.\n\n90\n00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:19.696\nOf course, I can double-click\non one of these documents,\n\n91\n00:05:19.696 --> 00:05:23.910\nI can edit this document,\nI can save it, I can close it.\n\n92\n00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:28.411\nLet me zoom back out, and\nwe can save that, we can close that,\n\n93\n00:05:28.411 --> 00:05:32.845\nno problem, all right,\ncuz I'm on the corporate network.\n\n94\n00:05:32.845 --> 00:05:36.062\nBut now, I'm gonna disconnect my network,\nright, so\n\n95\n00:05:36.062 --> 00:05:41.200\nwe're gonna pretend basically that\nI've left the corporate network.\n\n96\n00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:45.562\nSo let me go into Ethernet,\nfind my network adapter, oops,\n\n97\n00:05:45.562 --> 00:05:47.967\nlet's change adapter options.\n\n98\n00:05:47.967 --> 00:05:51.559\nAnd we are going to disable\nthat network adapter, so\n\n99\n00:05:51.559 --> 00:05:54.260\nnow I've lost network connectivity.\n\n100\n00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.530\nThis would be like me, again,\ngoing home or being on a trip, but\n\n101\n00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:00.130\nI'm no longer connected\nto the work network.\n\n102\n00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:05.190\nOpen up file explorer and\nI try to navigate to that same share.\n\n103\n00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:08.210\nWe'll just see that eventually,\nthis is gonna time out.\n\n104\n00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:11.500\nIt's gonna give me a failure,\nnetwork location cannot be found.\n\n105\n00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:16.007\nThere we go, as we can see,\ncannot access \\\\dc03\\Docs.\n\n106\n00:06:16.007 --> 00:06:19.960\nIf I take a look at the details,\nthe network path was not found.\n\n107\n00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:22.820\nMakes sense,\nI'm not connected to the network, so\n\n108\n00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:24.810\nI can't connect to that resource.\n\n109\n00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:30.190\nSo if we wanna use offline files,\nwe need to turn this capability on.\n\n110\n00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:33.370\nSo what I'm gonna do,\nclose File Explorer, and\n\n111\n00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:36.020\nI'm gonna go into something\nknown as my Sync Center.\n\n112\n00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:40.110\nThis is where they've buried\nthe offline file settings.\n\n113\n00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:44.835\nThe problem is, getting to the Sync Center\nis not super easy [LAUGH].\n\n114\n00:06:44.835 --> 00:06:47.210\nI won't say it's difficult,\nbut it's strange.\n\n115\n00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:53.910\nIf I go to my Start menu and I type in\nSync Center, I get absolutely nothing.\n\n116\n00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:58.010\nSync opens up a form of\nsyncing my settings.\n\n117\n00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:01.920\nThis has to do with my Microsoft account\nand syncing options like backgrounds and\n\n118\n00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:03.450\nthings like that, across both devices.\n\n119\n00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:07.370\nSo this is not what we're looking for,\nI'm gonna close that out.\n\n120\n00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:10.960\nWhat we really need to do is\nget into the old Control Panel.\n\n121\n00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:17.690\nAnd from the old Control Panel,\nI've changed my view to the large icons,\n\n122\n00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:19.990\nthere is the good old Sync Center.\n\n123\n00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:23.430\nNow, why this doesn't show up in a search\nfrom the Start menu, I don't know.\n\n124\n00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:26.494\nIn fact, I can go up here and\ntype in sync, and\n\n125\n00:07:26.494 --> 00:07:31.000\nlet's say, okay good,\nit did find it that time, so there we go.\n\n126\n00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.570\nIf you're in the Control Panel and\nyou're already looking at the icon,\n\n127\n00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:37.310\nyou can search and find it,\nthank you Microsoft.\n\n128\n00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:40.050\nAll right, so anyway,\nhere I am in the Sync Center.\n\n129\n00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:43.980\nAnd one of my options in the Sync Center\nis manage offline files.\n\n130\n00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:47.020\nSo let me see if I can zoom\nin a little bit for you,\n\n131\n00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:49.463\nright there is manage offline files.\n\n132\n00:07:49.463 --> 00:07:52.728\nThat's the one I'm looking for,\nso I click on that,\n\n133\n00:07:52.728 --> 00:07:56.007\nthat's gonna open up my\noffline files dialogue box.\n\n134\n00:07:56.007 --> 00:07:58.787\nAnd you can see,\nmost of it's grayed out except for\n\n135\n00:07:58.787 --> 00:08:01.188\nthe button that says enable offline files.\n\n136\n00:08:01.188 --> 00:08:03.290\nThat's how I'm gonna turn this feature on.\n\n137\n00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:07.289\nNow, in a domain environment, if this\nis a something your enterprise wants\n\n138\n00:08:07.289 --> 00:08:11.360\nyou to use and enable, they might very\nwell use a group policy to enable this.\n\n139\n00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:14.240\nSo that you don't have to do\nit on each individual machine.\n\n140\n00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:17.400\nNow, I'll show you that group policy\nsetting in just a few minutes.\n\n141\n00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:21.610\nBut let's take a look at how we can turn\nit on here on a single machine first.\n\n142\n00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:24.989\nSo I'm just gonna click\nEnable offline files.\n\n143\n00:08:24.989 --> 00:08:27.239\nAnd now you'll see that my button changes.\n\n144\n00:08:27.239 --> 00:08:29.198\nIt says Disable offline files which,\n\n145\n00:08:29.198 --> 00:08:32.360\nis the indicator that\noffline files is now enabled.\n\n146\n00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:34.920\nBelow there it says,\nOffline files is currently enabled.\n\n147\n00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:38.134\nSo pretty easy to tell\nthat it's turned on.\n\n148\n00:08:38.134 --> 00:08:42.245\nI also have Open sync center and\nView your online files.\n\n149\n00:08:42.245 --> 00:08:45.610\nWe'll come back to these\noptions here in just a minute.\n\n150\n00:08:46.664 --> 00:08:48.290\nAll right, and\nyou know what I forgot to do, Cherokee,\n\n151\n00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:52.430\nis I better turn my network adapter\nback on if any of this is going to work.\n\n152\n00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:59.230\nSo let me flip back over and\nreconnect to that domain network.\n\n153\n00:08:59.230 --> 00:09:01.904\nAnd turn that guy back on.\n\n154\n00:09:05.129 --> 00:09:07.870\nAll right, so I'm at work.\n\n155\n00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:09.520\nI'm connected to the work network.\n\n156\n00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:13.016\nI've gone into my Sync Center and\nI've enabled offline files.\n\n157\n00:09:13.016 --> 00:09:13.860\nSo now what do I do?\n\n158\n00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:20.500\nWe're gonna go into File Explorer,\nand I'm gonna navigate to that Share.\n\n159\n00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:21.600\nI'm gonna say // and\n\n160\n00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:27.040\nthe name of my share, name of the server /\nname of the share, and I'll connect to it.\n\n161\n00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:29.468\nAnd I've got these documents again,\nthe same place.\n\n162\n00:09:29.468 --> 00:09:32.130\nI'm gonna right-click on one of these.\n\n163\n00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:37.220\nAnd you'll see there's an option here,\nAlways available offline, all right?\n\n164\n00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:39.746\nThat's gonna make this\ndocument available offline.\n\n165\n00:09:39.746 --> 00:09:42.350\nThis is how we create offline files.\n\n166\n00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:46.541\nWe'll choose always available, and you'll\nsee it starts as, let me zoom back out.\n\n167\n00:09:46.541 --> 00:09:51.188\nYou might've seen that little message\ndialog pop up for just a second, and\n\n168\n00:09:51.188 --> 00:09:53.570\nnow look at the icon on that document.\n\n169\n00:09:53.570 --> 00:09:58.517\nI've got that little Sync Center icon,\nand that's my visual indicator that this\n\n170\n00:09:58.517 --> 00:10:03.670\nis going to be available even when I'm\nnot connected to the network, right?\n\n171\n00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:05.280\nI'm gonna zoom back out.\n\n172\n00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:06.820\nLet me show you one other place.\n\n173\n00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:12.960\nOn the Home ribbon, in a strange place,\nunderneath Easy access, all right?\n\n174\n00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:17.720\nI know, you'll hit your dropdown list,\nand up here, there's that same option,\n\n175\n00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:19.716\nAlways available offline.\n\n176\n00:10:19.716 --> 00:10:23.530\nSo if I had selected a file\ndown here in File Explorer and\n\n177\n00:10:23.530 --> 00:10:26.510\nthen gone up to my Home ribbon.\n\n178\n00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:32.380\nEasy access and then Always available\noffline, same thing's gonna happen.\n\n179\n00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:34.810\nWe can see that I've got\nthat special icon now\n\n180\n00:10:34.810 --> 00:10:36.650\nindicating this is gonna\nbe available offline.\n\n181\n00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:40.073\nAll right, so\ntwo different ways I can enable those off.\n\n182\n00:10:40.073 --> 00:10:43.140\nWell, choose which files\nare available offline, right?\n\n183\n00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:46.180\nEnabling offline files was\ndone through the Sync Center.\n\n184\n00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:49.631\nAnd now I'm choosing what\nfiles are available offline.\n\n185\n00:10:49.631 --> 00:10:52.830\nSo if I double-click on these now,\nthey open up no problem,\n\n186\n00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:56.265\neven the one that's not available offline,\nI'm able to open.\n\n187\n00:10:56.265 --> 00:10:58.457\nMakes sense,\nI'm connected to the corporate network.\n\n188\n00:10:58.457 --> 00:10:59.206\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n189\n00:10:59.206 --> 00:11:00.397\n&gt;&gt; But now guess what we are gonna do\n\n190\n00:11:00.397 --> 00:11:02.380\nCherokee.\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna go on vocation and\n\n191\n00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:04.292\nbring our work with us.\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n192\n00:11:04.292 --> 00:11:06.738\n[LAUGH] So\nI'm gonna go back into Ethernet, and\n\n193\n00:11:06.738 --> 00:11:09.120\nI'm gonna change adapter options.\n\n194\n00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:11.910\nAnd I'm going to disable my network.\n\n195\n00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:13.570\nAgain, this is not what\nyou will normally do,\n\n196\n00:11:13.570 --> 00:11:15.980\nthis is just for demonstration purposes.\n\n197\n00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:20.198\nI need to show that my machine is\nnot connected to the work network.\n\n198\n00:11:20.198 --> 00:11:25.373\nSo we get rid of that, and now you notice\nthat my view has changed a little bit.\n\n199\n00:11:25.373 --> 00:11:28.135\nLet me close this and open this back up.\n\n200\n00:11:28.135 --> 00:11:32.885\nCuz normally, right, I would have turned\noff my laptop, gone home, what have you,\n\n201\n00:11:32.885 --> 00:11:36.450\nopened it back up, and\nI'm not connected to the work network.\n\n202\n00:11:36.450 --> 00:11:43.604\nI'm going to click on File Explorer, and\nI'm gonna try to navigate to that share.\n\n203\n00:11:43.604 --> 00:11:49.380\nAnd there we'll see that I have two\ndocuments that have that green icon.\n\n204\n00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:50.700\nI double-click on doc01.\n\n205\n00:11:51.730 --> 00:11:53.160\nSure enough, there it i.\n\n206\n00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:54.160\nI'm able to open it up.\n\n207\n00:11:55.690 --> 00:12:00.070\nAnd I can say, so was Cherokee, all right?\n\n208\n00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:02.930\nSo I can edit the document.\n\n209\n00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:06.020\nI can save the document, zoom back out.\n\n210\n00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:07.200\nI can close it.\n\n211\n00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:10.560\nSo even though I'm not\nconnected to the work network,\n\n212\n00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:14.370\nI'm able to access these files\nthat were available offline.\n\n213\n00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:18.463\nThis file is offline.\n\n214\n00:12:18.463 --> 00:12:20.810\nOops, if I could spell, there we go.\n\n215\n00:12:20.810 --> 00:12:22.790\nI'll save it, and I'll close it.\n\n216\n00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:25.690\nNow why Doc 2 is showing and not Doc 4?\n\n217\n00:12:25.690 --> 00:12:30.130\nThat's a good question, that's just good\nold Windows doing some funky things.\n\n218\n00:12:30.130 --> 00:12:33.380\nBut if I try to open it, you'll see,\nThis file is currently not available for\n\n219\n00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:35.530\nuse on this computer.\n\n220\n00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:40.860\nAnd again, that's because I'm not\nreally connected to the share, okay?\n\n221\n00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:43.292\nNow, if we go take a look\nat the share itself,\n\n222\n00:12:43.292 --> 00:12:47.170\nso I'm gonna go back over to\nthe corporate network, all right?\n\n223\n00:12:47.170 --> 00:12:52.680\nAnd I'm gonna open up File Explorer,\nand I'm gonna open up that doc01.\n\n224\n00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:55.458\nNotice, it does not say,\nCherokee was, too,\n\n225\n00:12:55.458 --> 00:12:57.756\nor whatever I ended up typing in there.\n\n226\n00:12:57.756 --> 00:13:00.770\nAnd that's because I made\nthat change from home.\n\n227\n00:13:00.770 --> 00:13:02.900\nI'm not connected to the work network yet.\n\n228\n00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:05.620\nThose changes won't appear\nback on the work network\n\n229\n00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:07.710\nuntil I reconnect to the work network, and\n\n230\n00:13:07.710 --> 00:13:11.342\nI can synchronize those changes.\n&gt;&gt; So Mike,\n\n231\n00:13:11.342 --> 00:13:15.872\nyou actually just showed me something\nthat reminded me about security.\n\n232\n00:13:15.872 --> 00:13:19.428\nBecause I know when you're setting\nup something, I just remember when\n\n233\n00:13:19.428 --> 00:13:23.458\nI was setting up work folders for the end\nusers' side of things, they get a little\n\n234\n00:13:23.458 --> 00:13:26.985\npop up that says, an administrator\nhas the right to view these files.\n\n235\n00:13:26.985 --> 00:13:30.805\nSomething to let that\ntransparency be known.\n\n236\n00:13:30.805 --> 00:13:33.985\nBut as an administrator,\nyou just pulled up that file there.\n\n237\n00:13:33.985 --> 00:13:38.565\nSo this is not like the owner is\nthe only person that can view that file,\n\n238\n00:13:38.565 --> 00:13:39.885\npotentially?\n&gt;&gt; Correct, yeah,\n\n239\n00:13:39.885 --> 00:13:43.570\nthis is just a normal shared folder,\non any network.\n\n240\n00:13:43.570 --> 00:13:47.310\nSo the permissions are what I said\nearlier, when I created the folder.\n\n241\n00:13:47.310 --> 00:13:49.120\nI gave authenticated users read and write.\n\n242\n00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:52.575\nSo permissions are still checked.\n\n243\n00:13:52.575 --> 00:13:55.670\nYou can't cache files that\nyou don't have access to.\n\n244\n00:13:55.670 --> 00:13:59.568\nYou can't get write access to files that\nyou wouldn't normally have access to,\n\n245\n00:13:59.568 --> 00:14:01.301\nby making them available offline.\n\n246\n00:14:01.301 --> 00:14:05.899\nSo NTFS permissions are still gonna\nbe in full effect on those documents.\n\n247\n00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:09.240\nAll right, so back over to the client.\n\n248\n00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:13.445\nSo we've made some changes,\nwe went to bed, we woke up the next day.\n\n249\n00:14:13.445 --> 00:14:17.090\nWe're gonna come back in, and\nwe're gonna plug into the network.\n\n250\n00:14:17.090 --> 00:14:23.860\nSo I'm going to enable my network adapter\nagain, just like I walked back in to work.\n\n251\n00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:25.120\nTurn my computer on.\n\n252\n00:14:26.170 --> 00:14:29.491\nAnd now when I open up File Explorer, and\n\n253\n00:14:29.491 --> 00:14:34.876\nI navigate to that shared folder,\nI see all of those files again.\n\n254\n00:14:34.876 --> 00:14:36.304\nAnd if I look at doc01,\n\n255\n00:14:36.304 --> 00:14:39.275\nmy changes are there.\n&gt;&gt; Cool.\n\n256\n00:14:39.275 --> 00:14:40.809\n&gt;&gt; And if we go over to the server,\n\n257\n00:14:40.809 --> 00:14:42.520\nI'll see if I gave it enough time.\n\n258\n00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:44.190\nThis can take a little bit.\n\n259\n00:14:44.190 --> 00:14:45.900\nYeah, you think your user just logged on.\n\n260\n00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:47.540\nThey just connected to the network.\n\n261\n00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:49.980\nSo it might take a minute before,\nbut there we go,\n\n262\n00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:53.450\nthose changes have already been\nsynchronized with the original.\n\n263\n00:14:53.450 --> 00:14:58.750\nSo that is the way offline files\nworks at its, basic all right?\n\n264\n00:14:58.750 --> 00:15:04.302\nNow, let's talk a little bit about some\nof the caveats of using offline files and\n\n265\n00:15:04.302 --> 00:15:08.072\na few other things I want you\nto be aware of for the exam.\n\n266\n00:15:08.072 --> 00:15:14.192\nFirst of all, when you go offline, right,\nhopefully you've noticed how I navigated.\n\n267\n00:15:14.192 --> 00:15:16.820\nAnd that's an easy question\nto get on the exam.\n\n268\n00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:20.350\nIt's also one that I think people\nget a little bit confused about.\n\n269\n00:15:20.350 --> 00:15:22.581\nI'm gonna disconnect\nfrom this network again.\n\n270\n00:15:24.248 --> 00:15:28.230\nAll right, so now I'm no longer connected.\n\n271\n00:15:28.230 --> 00:15:31.260\nAnd people wanna say, well,\nwhere are those cached copies?\n\n272\n00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:33.878\nWhere are those offline file stored?\n\n273\n00:15:33.878 --> 00:15:37.019\nBecause I wanna be able to work with those\ndocuments while I'm not connected to\n\n274\n00:15:37.019 --> 00:15:38.340\nthe network.\n\n275\n00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:40.630\nAnd that's the wrong way to go about it.\n\n276\n00:15:40.630 --> 00:15:44.474\nWe do not wanna access those\noffline files directly.\n\n277\n00:15:44.474 --> 00:15:48.135\nThey're cached in a secured\nlocation on our hard drive,\n\n278\n00:15:48.135 --> 00:15:51.502\nand we're not supposed to\nbrowse directly to them.\n\n279\n00:15:51.502 --> 00:15:55.408\nFor the exam, and just so you're aware,\nI'll tell you where they're located, or\n\n280\n00:15:55.408 --> 00:15:55.913\nshow you.\n\n281\n00:15:55.913 --> 00:15:59.923\nC:/windows CSC, but\nwhen I try to double-click on this, and\n\n282\n00:15:59.923 --> 00:16:03.189\nI am the domain admin,\nby the way, you notice I get,\n\n283\n00:16:03.189 --> 00:16:06.470\nyou don't have permissions\nto access this folder.\n\n284\n00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:09.760\nI can continue if I want,\nI'm not going to, right.\n\n285\n00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:12.690\nBut, that's where they are, C:\\Windows or\n\n286\n00:16:12.690 --> 00:16:16.370\nwhatever your system drive is,\nCSC, all right.\n\n287\n00:16:16.370 --> 00:16:19.230\nThat's not how you're supposed\nto access offline files.\n\n288\n00:16:19.230 --> 00:16:22.880\nThe way you access offline files when\nyou're not connected to the network\n\n289\n00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:26.770\nis the exact same way you access them\nwhen you are connected to the network.\n\n290\n00:16:26.770 --> 00:16:30.050\nIf you use a map drive when you're\nconnected, use your map drive when\n\n291\n00:16:30.050 --> 00:16:33.010\nyou're not connected, and\nI know that's counter-intuitive.\n\n292\n00:16:33.010 --> 00:16:37.550\nWhy would I type in a shared path when I\nknow I can't reach that shared server,\n\n293\n00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:39.730\nthe one that's hosting that shared folder?\n\n294\n00:16:39.730 --> 00:16:43.731\nBecause Windows is smart enough to\nrealize, hey, you can't connect to that.\n\n295\n00:16:43.731 --> 00:16:46.126\nWait, before I tell you you can't connect,\n\n296\n00:16:46.126 --> 00:16:49.100\nlet me see if you've made\nanything available offline.\n\n297\n00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:53.420\nLet me see if I've cached anything, and\nif so, it'll show you that cached content.\n\n298\n00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:55.170\nIf you don't have anything cached,\n\n299\n00:16:55.170 --> 00:16:57.650\nthen it's just gonna say\nnetwork path not found.\n\n300\n00:16:57.650 --> 00:17:00.550\nThat's how you're supposed to\nconnect to these offline files,\n\n301\n00:17:00.550 --> 00:17:04.750\nis the same way you connect to them\nwhen you are connected to the network.\n\n302\n00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:11.370\nSo map drives, UNC paths, however you\nnormally connect to that shared folder.\n\n303\n00:17:11.370 --> 00:17:15.010\nDon't go browsing into C:\\Windows\\CSC.\n\n304\n00:17:15.010 --> 00:17:18.160\nCuz you can start goofing up some of\nthe permissions that are set there,\n\n305\n00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:22.710\nand you might end up breaking\nthe way offline files works.\n\n306\n00:17:22.710 --> 00:17:26.508\nI've seen people try to say well,\nthat server's no longer available,\n\n307\n00:17:26.508 --> 00:17:30.750\nand I need access, that cached copy\nis the only one I've got left.\n\n308\n00:17:30.750 --> 00:17:35.025\nWell, fine, navigate to it,\nput server name slash share name,\n\n309\n00:17:35.025 --> 00:17:37.450\nand they're like, well,\nthe server doesn't exist anymore.\n\n310\n00:17:37.450 --> 00:17:40.450\nIt's okay, Windows knows and\nit's gonna check, you're telling it, hey,\n\n311\n00:17:40.450 --> 00:17:42.490\ngo check my cached content.\n\n312\n00:17:42.490 --> 00:17:46.360\nSo try not to, the idea is,\ndon't navigate directly into that folder.\n\n313\n00:17:48.290 --> 00:17:52.440\nThe other thing I do wanna talk\nabout with offline files is\n\n314\n00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:55.520\none of the negatives of\nusing offline files.\n\n315\n00:17:55.520 --> 00:18:00.274\nAnd that is the fact that it\ndoesn't do any type of versioning.\n\n316\n00:18:00.274 --> 00:18:01.182\nI think Cherokee,\n\n317\n00:18:01.182 --> 00:18:04.940\nyou were kind of hinting at this a little\nbit with something like work folders.\n\n318\n00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:07.653\nThere's other technologies, SharePoint,\n\n319\n00:18:07.653 --> 00:18:11.415\nwhere I have to check files out\nbefore I can bring that copy down.\n\n320\n00:18:11.415 --> 00:18:13.615\nAnybody else that tries to access them,\n\n321\n00:18:13.615 --> 00:18:17.340\nit's going to maybe give them\nread access or no access at all.\n\n322\n00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:20.600\nIt's a way that we make sure that\ntwo people aren't making changes\n\n323\n00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:22.760\nto the document at the same time.\n\n324\n00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:26.730\nOffline files unfortunately\ndoesn't do anything about this, so\n\n325\n00:18:26.730 --> 00:18:28.470\nhere's the scenario.\n\n326\n00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:33.447\nThere's a shared folder on our corporate\nnetwork, I cache a copy of a file locally.\n\n327\n00:18:33.447 --> 00:18:37.204\nCherokee also caches a copy of that\nsame file locally on her machine.\n\n328\n00:18:37.204 --> 00:18:38.242\nWe both go home,\n\n329\n00:18:38.242 --> 00:18:43.650\nwe both make changes to that document\nwhile in offline mode while at home.\n\n330\n00:18:43.650 --> 00:18:49.640\nTomorrow, Cherokee, being the good\nemployee she is, gets to work first.\n\n331\n00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:52.360\nPlugs her computer in,\nand offline files is gonna\n\n332\n00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:57.180\nimmediately synchronize her changes\nwith that original document, okay?\n\n333\n00:18:57.180 --> 00:19:01.000\nNow, I come strolling in a little bit\nlater because I'm the slacker, and\n\n334\n00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:02.460\nI plug into the network.\n\n335\n00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:07.190\nAnd now offline files is gonna\nattempt to synchronize my changes\n\n336\n00:19:07.190 --> 00:19:10.820\nwith that local copy or\nwith the master copy.\n\n337\n00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:11.635\nAnd what's gonna happen is,\n\n338\n00:19:11.635 --> 00:19:16.790\noffline files is gonna detect that\nthe original has been modified.\n\n339\n00:19:16.790 --> 00:19:19.850\nSomething has changed\nsince the time I cached it\n\n340\n00:19:19.850 --> 00:19:22.290\nto before I've tried to\nsynchronize those changes.\n\n341\n00:19:22.290 --> 00:19:26.280\nIt's not the same document anymore,\nWindows understands that or sees that.\n\n342\n00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:28.950\nAnd what it's gonna do is pop up\na little dialog box that says,\n\n343\n00:19:28.950 --> 00:19:32.000\nhey, the original has been modified.\n\n344\n00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:37.150\nAnd it's gonna give me two choices,\ndo you want to save your copy, my copy,\n\n345\n00:19:37.150 --> 00:19:38.310\nwith a different name?\n\n346\n00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:42.290\nSo put it right next to Cherokee's\nchanges and just call it file, and\n\n347\n00:19:42.290 --> 00:19:45.800\nthen parentheses two, right, or file-copy.\n\n348\n00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:49.430\nThat way I have my changes\nthat I made last night but\n\n349\n00:19:49.430 --> 00:19:51.460\nI didn't mess with Cherokee's changes.\n\n350\n00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:55.009\nMy other choice is to overwrite\nthe original with mine.\n\n351\n00:19:55.009 --> 00:19:56.297\nAnd if I choose that,\n\n352\n00:19:56.297 --> 00:19:59.175\nmy changes are gonna overwrite-\n&gt;&gt; You're gonna upset\n\n353\n00:19:59.175 --> 00:20:01.759\nme.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, everything that Cherokee did last\n\n354\n00:20:01.759 --> 00:20:06.830\nnight is now gone because I decided to\noverwrite the file with my changes, right?\n\n355\n00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:08.549\nAnd this is a problem with offline files,\n\n356\n00:20:08.549 --> 00:20:11.580\ncuz it puts that decision\nin the end user's hands.\n\n357\n00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:14.206\nAnd sometimes they don't\nalways make the correct or\n\n358\n00:20:14.206 --> 00:20:17.965\nthe most appropriate decision.\n&gt;&gt; And while those were only two really\n\n359\n00:20:17.965 --> 00:20:22.350\nexamples with those cached files and\nthen those synchronization issues.\n\n360\n00:20:22.350 --> 00:20:27.325\nThat was enough to go ahead and prompt or\nurge Microsoft to create a newer solution\n\n361\n00:20:27.325 --> 00:20:30.782\nfor this, because it was such\na headache for end users.\n\n362\n00:20:30.782 --> 00:20:33.463\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely, it causes a problem,\n\n363\n00:20:33.463 --> 00:20:37.266\nit doesn't do any versioning,\nso we can end up losing data.\n\n364\n00:20:37.266 --> 00:20:41.046\nAnd losing data is always bad, and yeah,\nCherokee's gonna be a little upset with me\n\n365\n00:20:41.046 --> 00:20:44.611\nwhen the boss says, Mike, I see you\ndid a great job last night, Cherokee,\n\n366\n00:20:44.611 --> 00:20:46.626\nwhat the heck did you do?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n367\n00:20:46.626 --> 00:20:47.271\n&gt;&gt; And she's like,\n\n368\n00:20:47.271 --> 00:20:50.152\nI swear I put changes up there, and I'd\nbe like, [SOUND] I don't know what she's\n\n369\n00:20:50.152 --> 00:20:51.300\ntalking about.\n&gt;&gt; Sure,\n\n370\n00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:53.150\nCherokee [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\n\n371\n00:20:53.150 --> 00:20:56.520\nversioning is a real\nproblem with offline files.\n\n372\n00:20:56.520 --> 00:21:01.363\nSo it's not something you're\ngonna use as a company to\n\n373\n00:21:01.363 --> 00:21:06.006\nallow access to documents that are shared,\nright?\n\n374\n00:21:06.006 --> 00:21:10.341\nThat's not a good way to say it, for-\n&gt;&gt; Frequently\n\n375\n00:21:10.341 --> 00:21:12.870\nmodified documents?\n&gt;&gt; That a lot of people are gonna be\n\n376\n00:21:12.870 --> 00:21:16.050\naccessing and\nmaking changes to, all right?\n\n377\n00:21:16.050 --> 00:21:18.720\nIt's great for one file here,\none file there.\n\n378\n00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:21.910\nIt's really good for just accessing\ndocuments when you're not connected.\n\n379\n00:21:21.910 --> 00:21:25.450\nLike maybe there's\na spreadsheet up there that has\n\n380\n00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:29.420\na bunch of customers' information,\nso that I can make calls.\n\n381\n00:21:29.420 --> 00:21:32.330\nI might cache that locally so\nthat I've got a copy of it even when I'm\n\n382\n00:21:32.330 --> 00:21:37.110\nnot connected to the network, but I'm not\nreally making a lot of changes to it.\n\n383\n00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:40.690\nSo if it is a document that a team\nis working on, that multiple people\n\n384\n00:21:40.690 --> 00:21:44.230\nare making changes to, offline files\nis probably not the way to go.\n\n385\n00:21:44.230 --> 00:21:47.650\nBut if it's just making copies of\nthose files available while you're not\n\n386\n00:21:47.650 --> 00:21:50.440\nconnected, then offline files will work,\nall right?\n\n387\n00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:54.230\nOffline files can be used even in\nsituations like with desktops,\n\n388\n00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:57.720\nnot just with mobile devices, that's\nusually what we usually think of it as.\n\n389\n00:21:57.720 --> 00:21:59.772\nBut let's say I've got a branch office and\n\n390\n00:21:59.772 --> 00:22:02.748\nthey connect to shares that\nare back in the corporate office.\n\n391\n00:22:02.748 --> 00:22:04.653\nThat WAN link can be intermittent,\n\n392\n00:22:04.653 --> 00:22:08.857\nmaybe we don't have a high quality\nconnection going at to that branch office.\n\n393\n00:22:08.857 --> 00:22:11.587\nAnd if that's the case,\nwhen that share goes down,\n\n394\n00:22:11.587 --> 00:22:15.374\nor when that network connection goes down,\nthey can no longer connect to\n\n395\n00:22:15.374 --> 00:22:19.314\nthe corporate office and access those\nshared folders and all those files.\n\n396\n00:22:19.314 --> 00:22:23.562\nBy enabling offline files on those branch\noffice computers, while they're working\n\n397\n00:22:23.562 --> 00:22:27.220\nwith those documents, if the connection\ngoes down between the branch and\n\n398\n00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:30.120\nthe corporate office,\nthey can continue to work.\n\n399\n00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:34.570\nA little balloon will pop up in their\ndialogue by their system tray that says,\n\n400\n00:22:34.570 --> 00:22:35.920\nhey, you're working in offline mode.\n\n401\n00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:39.237\nAnd they can continue to work\nwith the document, no data loss.\n\n402\n00:22:39.237 --> 00:22:42.570\nThey just keep on typing,\ndoing whatever it is that they're doing.\n\n403\n00:22:42.570 --> 00:22:45.580\nAnd as soon as that connection to\nthe corporate office comes back up,\n\n404\n00:22:45.580 --> 00:22:49.760\nit'll in the background synchronize their\nchanges with that original document.\n\n405\n00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:54.457\nSo it can be a way to hide intermittent\nnetwork connectivity from our end users\n\n406\n00:22:54.457 --> 00:22:58.069\nin locations where we don't\nhave a good solid connection or\n\n407\n00:22:58.069 --> 00:23:00.835\nwe have intermittent connectivity issues.\n\n408\n00:23:00.835 --> 00:23:04.513\nAgain, we have to worry about\nversioning and things like that, but\n\n409\n00:23:04.513 --> 00:23:07.088\nit is a very low cost, all built in to-\n&gt;&gt; Very true.\n\n410\n00:23:07.088 --> 00:23:10.190\n&gt;&gt; Windows solution for things like that.\n\n411\n00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:17.380\nAll right, I think that probably is a good\nlook at offline files as far as the client\n\n412\n00:23:17.380 --> 00:23:20.068\nis concerned, which is primarily\nwhat you are going to be tested on.\n\n413\n00:23:20.068 --> 00:23:24.590\nI do wanna give you a little more\ninformation just in case they ask you,\n\n414\n00:23:24.590 --> 00:23:26.730\nplus it's gonna help you\nin other exams as well.\n\n415\n00:23:26.730 --> 00:23:29.050\nSo I'm gonna flip over to\nthe domain controller and\n\n416\n00:23:29.050 --> 00:23:31.470\nI'm gonna go take a look at that share.\n\n417\n00:23:31.470 --> 00:23:33.080\nWhen we talk about offline files,\n\n418\n00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:36.430\nnot everything is available offline,\nfirst of all.\n\n419\n00:23:36.430 --> 00:23:40.950\nOnly files that are in a shared\nfolder can I make available\n\n420\n00:23:40.950 --> 00:23:43.150\noffline on my Windows 10 clients.\n\n421\n00:23:43.150 --> 00:23:45.583\nSo they have to be shared\nout in the first place.\n\n422\n00:23:45.583 --> 00:23:50.129\nAs a server admin,\nthey can control what's available or\n\n423\n00:23:50.129 --> 00:23:54.499\nthe availability of those\nresources in offline mode.\n\n424\n00:23:54.499 --> 00:23:56.119\nIf go into my Sharing tab So\n\n425\n00:23:56.119 --> 00:24:01.215\nthis is the folder that we were pulling\nthose docs one, two, three and four from.\n\n426\n00:24:01.215 --> 00:24:04.562\nIf I go down to\nthe Advanced Sharing options,\n\n427\n00:24:04.562 --> 00:24:07.390\nI'll see, let me zoom or slide down.\n\n428\n00:24:07.390 --> 00:24:11.418\nI'll see a Caching button here,\nand on the, let me zoom out so\n\n429\n00:24:11.418 --> 00:24:15.152\nyou can see where I'm at, so\nI'll do that one more time.\n\n430\n00:24:15.152 --> 00:24:20.516\nI've pulled up the Properties for the\nshared folder, I went to the Sharing tab.\n\n431\n00:24:20.516 --> 00:24:24.822\nI'm going to click Advanced Sharing, and\nthen I'm going to click Caching, and\n\n432\n00:24:24.822 --> 00:24:26.480\nhere I've got three options.\n\n433\n00:24:27.650 --> 00:24:32.474\nThe first one, which is the default, when\nI shared this folder before this episode,\n\n434\n00:24:32.474 --> 00:24:34.093\nthis is the default option.\n\n435\n00:24:34.093 --> 00:24:37.856\nOnly the files and programs that the user\nspecifies are available offline,\n\n436\n00:24:37.856 --> 00:24:41.090\nwhich is the exact behavior\nI just demonstrated to you.\n\n437\n00:24:41.090 --> 00:24:43.884\nWhen I went into that folder\nthere were four files, docs one,\n\n438\n00:24:43.884 --> 00:24:45.021\ntwo, three, and four.\n\n439\n00:24:45.021 --> 00:24:49.340\nI chose to make doc one and\ndoc three available offline.\n\n440\n00:24:49.340 --> 00:24:52.827\nSo only files that I specifically\nright-click on and say,\n\n441\n00:24:52.827 --> 00:24:57.581\nmake available offline, are going to be\ncached, which is a great idea, right?\n\n442\n00:24:57.581 --> 00:25:01.024\nIf there are hundreds of files in that\nfolder, I don't necessarily want all of\n\n443\n00:25:01.024 --> 00:25:02.906\nthose being cached.\n&gt;&gt; All of them to save.\n\n444\n00:25:02.906 --> 00:25:03.770\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean,\n\n445\n00:25:03.770 --> 00:25:07.092\nthat can end up eating up a lot\nof disk space on my laptop, for\n\n446\n00:25:07.092 --> 00:25:09.470\nstuff that I don't need.\n\n447\n00:25:09.470 --> 00:25:13.049\nSo that is the default,\nand that is a good option.\n\n448\n00:25:13.049 --> 00:25:13.986\nRight below that,\n\n449\n00:25:13.986 --> 00:25:17.327\nNo files or programs from the shared\nfolder are available offline.\n\n450\n00:25:17.327 --> 00:25:20.635\nSo if you run into a scenario where\na user is telling you, hey, look,\n\n451\n00:25:20.635 --> 00:25:24.700\nI'm trying to make these files available\noffline, but it's not allowing me.\n\n452\n00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:25.859\nThe option is grayed out.\n\n453\n00:25:25.859 --> 00:25:29.963\nWhen I navigate to the share and\nI right-click on the document,\n\n454\n00:25:29.963 --> 00:25:33.930\nthe option to make it always\navailable offline is grayed out.\n\n455\n00:25:33.930 --> 00:25:37.412\nThat could be because an administrator\nhas chosen, No files or\n\n456\n00:25:37.412 --> 00:25:40.576\nprograms from the shared\nfolder are available offline.\n\n457\n00:25:40.576 --> 00:25:43.366\nMaybe these are sensitive documents and\nwe've got industry or\n\n458\n00:25:43.366 --> 00:25:44.684\ngovernmental regulations.\n\n459\n00:25:44.684 --> 00:25:49.060\nOr policies that don't allow\nthese documents to be accessed\n\n460\n00:25:49.060 --> 00:25:52.610\noutside of the corporate network, right?\n\n461\n00:25:52.610 --> 00:25:55.843\nHIPPA compliance is one of\nthe first ones that comes to mind.\n\n462\n00:25:55.843 --> 00:25:59.032\nI can't start making personally\nidentifiable information,\n\n463\n00:25:59.032 --> 00:26:02.349\nI can't cache that on my laptop and\ntake it out of the enterprise.\n\n464\n00:26:02.349 --> 00:26:05.701\nIt most likely is going to be\nsome kind of violation, right?\n\n465\n00:26:05.701 --> 00:26:09.773\nSo you might have a scenario where I don't\nwant anybody making those files available\n\n466\n00:26:09.773 --> 00:26:10.910\noffline.\n\n467\n00:26:10.910 --> 00:26:13.797\nYou also have the option,\nAll files and programs that a user\n\n468\n00:26:13.797 --> 00:26:17.166\nopens from the shared folder\nare automatically available offline.\n\n469\n00:26:17.166 --> 00:26:20.837\nWhat this is going to do,\nwhen I navigate into that shared folder,\n\n470\n00:26:20.837 --> 00:26:23.660\nif I double click on document one,\nfor example.\n\n471\n00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:27.268\nAnd I just open it up, I look at it\nin Notepad, and then I close it,\n\n472\n00:26:27.268 --> 00:26:29.185\nit will now be available offline.\n\n473\n00:26:29.185 --> 00:26:31.996\nWindows is going to say, okay,\nthat's a file you accessed,\n\n474\n00:26:31.996 --> 00:26:34.600\nI'm going to make sure that\nyou always have access to it.\n\n475\n00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:39.498\nSo all files and programs that a user\nopens will automatically be made available\n\n476\n00:26:39.498 --> 00:26:42.655\noffline, so\nthose are our three options in there.\n\n477\n00:26:42.655 --> 00:26:45.990\nAnd I'd show you this again,\nbut this is a client exam, but\n\n478\n00:26:45.990 --> 00:26:49.910\nmore from the perspective of\ntroubleshooting offline files.\n\n479\n00:26:49.910 --> 00:26:52.098\nWhy can't I make this available offline?\n\n480\n00:26:52.098 --> 00:26:56.859\nWell, because the server admin has chosen\nthat option, or, why are all these\n\n481\n00:26:56.859 --> 00:27:00.158\nfiles cached on my local machine?\n&gt;&gt; Well, good point, I mean,\n\n482\n00:27:00.158 --> 00:27:02.660\nyou don't want to be banging\nyour head up against the wall.\n\n483\n00:27:02.660 --> 00:27:06.120\nNot knowing that there could potentially\nbe a problem residing elsewhere.\n\n484\n00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:07.736\n&gt;&gt; Yep, exactly right.\n\n485\n00:27:07.736 --> 00:27:12.150\nAll right, so\nlet's take a look now at a group policy.\n\n486\n00:27:12.150 --> 00:27:14.679\nI know we're getting\na little short on time, so\n\n487\n00:27:14.679 --> 00:27:18.676\nI'm going to open up a group policy and\nI'm gonna go into edit that policy.\n\n488\n00:27:18.676 --> 00:27:21.333\nAnd again,\nthis is the server side of things, but\n\n489\n00:27:21.333 --> 00:27:24.320\nthe exam sometimes you'll\nsee questions on this side.\n\n490\n00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:28.415\nSo underneath Computer Configuration,\nlet me zoom in a little bit for you.\n\n491\n00:27:28.415 --> 00:27:32.559\nPolicies, Administrative Templates,\nNetwork, and\n\n492\n00:27:32.559 --> 00:27:37.488\nthen I'll scroll down a little bit and\nwe'll see Offline Files.\n\n493\n00:27:37.488 --> 00:27:38.891\nI'm going to zoom back out so\n\n494\n00:27:38.891 --> 00:27:42.351\nwe can see all of these settings that\nare available for Offline Files.\n\n495\n00:27:42.351 --> 00:27:48.078\nAnd don't worry, you do not need to know\nall of these settings to pass this exam,\n\n496\n00:27:48.078 --> 00:27:50.957\nbut there are a couple I want to show you.\n\n497\n00:27:50.957 --> 00:27:55.470\nOne, I can disallow to use\nof offline files, all right?\n\n498\n00:27:55.470 --> 00:27:59.354\nSo, I might, as an administrator,\nnot want anybody creating a share and\n\n499\n00:27:59.354 --> 00:28:00.744\nenabling offline files.\n\n500\n00:28:00.744 --> 00:28:04.692\nSo I can turn off offline files,\nthat's one option,\n\n501\n00:28:04.692 --> 00:28:08.670\nyou can start removing\nMake Available Offline.\n\n502\n00:28:08.670 --> 00:28:12.545\nFrom their start menu or from the right\nclick menu, from their context menu.\n\n503\n00:28:12.545 --> 00:28:17.470\nYou can also control some\nof the catching options.\n\n504\n00:28:17.470 --> 00:28:21.598\nLike to synchronize all offline\nfiles before logging on,\n\n505\n00:28:21.598 --> 00:28:25.314\nor synchronize all offline\nfiles when logging off.\n\n506\n00:28:25.314 --> 00:28:28.158\nSo I show you this not so\nmuch that I need you to go in and\n\n507\n00:28:28.158 --> 00:28:30.309\nstudy this information for this exam.\n\n508\n00:28:30.309 --> 00:28:33.370\nIt will come up in the servers exam,\nbut just I want you to be aware\n\n509\n00:28:33.370 --> 00:28:36.770\nthat these settings can be\ncontrolled through group policy.\n\n510\n00:28:36.770 --> 00:28:41.564\nSo if the question on the exam is talking\nabout these settings are grayed out or\n\n511\n00:28:41.564 --> 00:28:43.426\nit says that they are locked.\n\n512\n00:28:43.426 --> 00:28:46.638\nIt could be because there's\na group policy at the domain level\n\n513\n00:28:46.638 --> 00:28:48.693\nthat's configuring those settings.\n\n514\n00:28:48.693 --> 00:28:52.129\nAnd you're unable to change\nthem on a local machine.\n\n515\n00:28:52.129 --> 00:28:56.775\nYou can also choose to encrypt\nthe Offline Files cache, all right?\n\n516\n00:28:56.775 --> 00:28:59.240\nWhich could be a very valuable option,\nright?\n\n517\n00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:03.600\nIf I'm allowing them to cache\ninformation on their local machine.\n\n518\n00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:07.573\nAnd if it's a laptop,\nwe know laptops are easy to lose, easy for\n\n519\n00:29:07.573 --> 00:29:10.824\npeople to steal,\ntake that hard drive out of there.\n\n520\n00:29:10.824 --> 00:29:17.849\nSo maybe I want to encrypt that temporary\ncopy of those cached Offline Files.\n\n521\n00:29:17.849 --> 00:29:20.524\nAll right, and\nyou can also control the default size, so\n\n522\n00:29:20.524 --> 00:29:22.550\nthat's another thing you can do.\n\n523\n00:29:22.550 --> 00:29:27.122\nI might limit how much space is available\nso that I don't end up eating up a lot of\n\n524\n00:29:27.122 --> 00:29:30.048\nthat user's disk space\non their personal drive.\n\n525\n00:29:30.048 --> 00:29:34.318\nWhich actually made me think\nof something else, Cherokee,\n\n526\n00:29:34.318 --> 00:29:39.352\nthat I wanted to mention about this,\nwhat was I just showing you?\n\n527\n00:29:39.352 --> 00:29:42.340\nThe log on and the log off options,\n\n528\n00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:48.121\nreminded me of another downside or\ncaveat to using offline files.\n\n529\n00:29:48.121 --> 00:29:50.670\nThey are synchronized when you log in.\n\n530\n00:29:50.670 --> 00:29:54.094\nSo when you come back to the network and\nyou log in, it's going to synchronize.\n\n531\n00:29:54.094 --> 00:29:55.234\nWhen you go to log off,\n\n532\n00:29:55.234 --> 00:29:58.842\nit's going to synchronize any files\nyou've made available offline.\n\n533\n00:29:58.842 --> 00:30:02.101\nIt's going to go grab a copy of those and\nmake sure you've got the current,\n\n534\n00:30:02.101 --> 00:30:04.860\nlatest copy before you\ndisconnect from the network.\n\n535\n00:30:04.860 --> 00:30:09.715\nWhich means that can slow my log on and\nlog off times down.\n\n536\n00:30:09.715 --> 00:30:14.461\nSo you might have users complaining, hey,\nwhy does it take so long to log on or\n\n537\n00:30:14.461 --> 00:30:15.580\nto log off?\n\n538\n00:30:15.580 --> 00:30:17.604\nIf they've made a lot of\nfiles available offline,\n\n539\n00:30:17.604 --> 00:30:19.449\nthat can definitely\naffect the performance.\n\n540\n00:30:19.449 --> 00:30:24.427\nSo those are other things I can\ncontrol through group policy, but\n\n541\n00:30:24.427 --> 00:30:28.147\nthat should do it, I think,\nfor offline files.\n\n542\n00:30:28.147 --> 00:30:31.727\nIt's, again,\na technology that's still around,\n\n543\n00:30:31.727 --> 00:30:34.041\nwe need to be aware of for the exam.\n\n544\n00:30:34.041 --> 00:30:38.991\nI like it, but it's not a replace, it is-\n&gt;&gt; It has its place.\n\n545\n00:30:38.991 --> 00:30:39.866\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it has its place,\n\n546\n00:30:39.866 --> 00:30:41.774\nwe'll just leave it at that.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, well,\n\n547\n00:30:41.774 --> 00:30:46.664\nMike, I know that you do have a lot more\nto explain to us that you'd like to share.\n\n548\n00:30:46.664 --> 00:30:50.390\nBut looking at the clock, it is time for\nus to go, go, go, so we will sign out,\n\n549\n00:30:50.390 --> 00:30:53.450\nI've been your host, Cherokee Boose.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n550\n00:30:53.450 --> 00:30:56.348\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITPRO.TV.\n\n551\n00:30:57.918 -->

00:00:09.490\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:14.730\n&gt;&gt; Welcome everyone to your\nconfiguring Windows devices series,\n\n5\n00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.680\nstudying for that 70 dash 697 exam.\n\n6\n00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.130\nI'm your host Cherokee Boose, and\n\n7\n00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.760\nin this episode We'll be taking\na look at mobility options part 2 and\n\n8\n00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.222\nof course, with us today, back in studios,\nwe have Mr. Mike Rodrick.\n\n9\n00:00:27.222 --> 00:00:28.820\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; How's it going today, Mike?\n\n10\n00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.190\n&gt;&gt; It's going great, Cherokee,\nI'm feeling very powerful today.\n\n11\n00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:36.260\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, did you do your power stances\nin the bathroom before the show?\n\n12\n00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.960\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n13\n00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:37.698\nI don't have any of those.\n\n14\n00:00:37.698 --> 00:00:38.590\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But we are working with\n\n15\n00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:39.202\nthe power options.\n\n16\n00:00:39.202 --> 00:00:42.100\n[LAUGH] So I figured,\nI'm feeling powerful.\n\n17\n00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:42.910\nOr something.\n\n18\n00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:44.920\nOr powerless, as my battery drains.\n\n19\n00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.890\nSo anyway, that's what we're\ngonna be taking a look at today,\n\n20\n00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.070\npower options in Windows 10.\n\n21\n00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.490\nAnd we'll take a look at it\nfrom the client perspective.\n\n22\n00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:54.370\nAgain, this is our Windows 10 exam, so\n\n23\n00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:57.110\nneed to know how to configure\nthese options in Windows 10.\n\n24\n00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:58.620\nI also wanna show you.\n\n25\n00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.450\nHow they can be configured\nthrough group policy as well.\n\n26\n00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.980\n&gt;&gt; Cool.\n\n27\n00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.890\n&gt;&gt; Take a look at some of\nthe group policy settings and\n\n28\n00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:05.770\neven group policy preferences.\n\n29\n00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.840\nI know there isn't a server class, but\nI feel like sometimes on these Windows 10\n\n30\n00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.570\nexams, they can go toward\nthat server side of things.\n\n31\n00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.250\nBecause as a help desk technician,\nas somebody that's working on Windows 10,\n\n32\n00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.780\nyou are expected to have\nsome knowledge of that.\n\n33\n00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.470\nEven if you don't directly\nmanage those servers.\n\n34\n00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.300\nYou have to know,\nwhen a person brings you their laptop, and\n\n35\n00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.100\nthose settings are grayed out,\nwhy they're grayed out.\n\n36\n00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.840\nWhat those options are in those group\npolicies that might be affecting\n\n37\n00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.530\nthose end-user systems\nthat you are supporting.\n\n38\n00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.390\nSo that is our plan for today.\n\n39\n00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.700\nWe're going to be taking\na look at my machine here,\n\n40\n00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.060\nto take a look at our power options.\n\n41\n00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.790\nAnd I figure, Cherokee, we might\nas well just Dive right in, right?\n\n42\n00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:43.360\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n43\n00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.620\n&gt;&gt; So\nlet's take a look at my screen right here.\n\n44\n00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:47.840\nPower options,\nit's a pretty straightforward concept.\n\n45\n00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.380\nWhen we talk about mobile devices,\nthese devices have batteries.\n\n46\n00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.700\nThey're not always plugged in\nto a source of electricity.\n\n47\n00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.300\nSo we want to try to make sure those\nbatteries last as long as possible.\n\n48\n00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:00.420\nHow many hours can you get?\n\n49\n00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.470\nWell we've got the same laptop.\n\n50\n00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:03.370\nHow many hours do you think you\ncan get out of your laptop?\n\n51\n00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.445\n&gt;&gt; Well, not enough for\na mornings worth of shows.\n\n52\n00:02:06.445 --> 00:02:08.170\n&gt;&gt; {LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's all I know.\n\n53\n00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:10.375\nThat's why we are plugged right here,\nright now.\n\n54\n00:02:10.375 --> 00:02:13.050\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, especially if you start\nusing virtual machines and\n\n55\n00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.240\nany power intensive type things,\nyou're using a lot of CPU cycles.\n\n56\n00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:22.610\nRemember that's all electricity being\nused so, but we wanna try to extend that.\n\n57\n00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.920\nI mean if I want to go sit on the couch\nI don't wanna drag out my power block,\n\n58\n00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.880\nI would like to be able get a little,\na little time out of there.\n\n59\n00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.350\nSo that's the idea,\nthat's what's all about.\n\n60\n00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.610\nSo here on my screen, I am just gonna go\nto my start menu and am simply gonna type.\n\n61\n00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.210\nPower and I see Power &amp; sleep settings.\n\n62\n00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:40.920\nWe're gonna take a look at that.\n\n63\n00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:46.500\nI can get this way or\nget to the same place if I close this.\n\n64\n00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:47.720\nI can go to my Start menu.\n\n65\n00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.820\nI can click on the little gear\nicon down here on my Start menu.\n\n66\n00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:53.490\nAnd then I can go to System,\n\n67\n00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:57.900\nwhich you can see includes display,\nnotifications, and power.\n\n68\n00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.120\nAnd then I can just jump down to power and\nselect it.\n\n69\n00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.160\nEither way you wanna get here it's fine.\n\n70\n00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.780\nOnce we get in here you can see there's\nreally done a lot of settings are there?\n\n71\n00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.825\n&gt;&gt; Not too many, it doesn't look too\nconfusing, but we'll have to wait and see.\n\n72\n00:03:09.825 --> 00:03:12.760\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It just gives you\na couple of options here.\n\n73\n00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.390\nYou can see that I have Screen then sleep.\n\n74\n00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.940\nThen I have two options and\nthat's because this is a laptop.\n\n75\n00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.460\nIf you're on a desktop system or\nif I was in of my virtual machines\n\n76\n00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:26.330\nthat doesn't realize that\nit's running on a laptop.\n\n77\n00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:28.750\nI wouldn't see the the on battery power.\n\n78\n00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.160\nAll of it have was screen and\nsleep and then one option.\n\n79\n00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.230\nSince this is a laptop or\nany other mobile device.\n\n80\n00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:39.110\nI have two,\nI have I think you can see that,\n\n81\n00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:41.700\nI'll zoom in just incase you can see that.\n\n82\n00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.190\nWhat I wanna do with my screen?\n\n83\n00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:46.850\nOn battery power, turn off after and\nI get this drop down list,\n\n84\n00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:49.220\nwhere I can choose\nthe appropriate amount of time.\n\n85\n00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:52.440\nAnd then when plugged in, turn off after.\n\n86\n00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.050\nAll right?\nAnd this is something that I do\n\n87\n00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.850\nhere on the show.\n\n88\n00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:56.220\nI'm always plugged in.\n\n89\n00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.450\nI don't want my screen turning off.\n\n90\n00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:02.670\nAnd if I'm plugged in at my desk, I don't\nneed it going to sleep when I walk over\n\n91\n00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:05.230\nto the water cooler and\nback or anything like that.\n\n92\n00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:09.560\nWhen I'm on battery, if I leave my laptop\nunattended, I wanted to shut down or\n\n93\n00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.800\nat least turn off that screen and\nstart saving some of that battery.\n\n94\n00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:17.720\nSame thing with sleep, as I scroll down\nhere, I went to I wanted to go to sleep.\n\n95\n00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.790\nAnd again this is my production laptop\nthat I use for shows and I don't wanna go\n\n96\n00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:25.250\ninto the sleep in the middle of\nan episode if there's any inactivity.\n\n97\n00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:27.440\nSo I have mine set to never.\n\n98\n00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:32.360\nBut you can see that I have\nthe same time choices here, right?\n\n99\n00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.660\nSo when is it gonna go to sleep when it's\non battery versus when is it gonna go to\n\n100\n00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:37.340\nsleep if it's plugged in.\n\n101\n00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:40.020\nIt detects power being applied.\n\n102\n00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:43.310\nSo those are our options when\nit comes to power and sleep.\n\n103\n00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:45.630\nI'm gonna show you a few more, in fact\nI'll go ahead and jump over there now.\n\n104\n00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:48.160\nWe do have this battery node over here.\n\n105\n00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.050\nThat I wanna take a look\nat in just a minute.\n\n106\n00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:52.220\nBut while we're here,\n\n107\n00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:57.310\non the righthand side I can see Related\nsettings and Additional power settings.\n\n108\n00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:59.540\nLet's go ahead and click on that link.\n\n109\n00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:02.310\nThis is gonna take me to the old\nschool for those of you that remember.\n\n110\n00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:06.570\nBefore we had this fancy\nnew settings pane, right?\n\n111\n00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:09.080\nThis is the old control panel applet.\n\n112\n00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:10.350\nFor my power options.\n\n113\n00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:13.730\nSo if you've been working with\nWindows this will look familiar.\n\n114\n00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:18.870\nAnd I have got a few simple options\nover here on the actions pen.\n\n115\n00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:25.190\nWhat to do, choose what the power buttons\ndo, choose what closing the lid does,\n\n116\n00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:29.250\ncreat a power plan,\nchoose when to turn the display off.\n\n117\n00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:31.780\nAnd change when the computer sleeps.\n\n118\n00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:33.060\nSo I can click on any of these.\n\n119\n00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:36.500\nI choose what the power buttons do, right?\n\n120\n00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:39.130\nAnd here I can see my options.\n\n121\n00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:40.980\nWhen I press the power button, Sleep.\n\n122\n00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:44.490\nIf you have ever wondered why your\nlaptop doesn't power off when you\n\n123\n00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:46.010\npush the power button Yes.\n\n124\n00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:47.730\n&gt;&gt; Because it default to this right.\n\n125\n00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:51.350\nIt actually goes to sleep\ninstead of powering off\n\n126\n00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:52.280\nwhich I always thought was odd.\n\n127\n00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:52.830\nBecause.\n\n128\n00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:53.910\n&gt;&gt; That the power button.\n\n129\n00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:58.400\n&gt;&gt; Yes and you typically have most laptops\nnow have sleep buttons that are for sleep.\n\n130\n00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:01.530\nSo why wouldn't I want this\none to actually shut down?\n\n131\n00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:04.180\nBut maybe that's what you want,\nor maybe that's what you need.\n\n132\n00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:06.950\nMaybe you need a quick easy\nway to fill the display.\n\n133\n00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:09.840\nSo I can change this to,\nturn off the display.\n\n134\n00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:13.850\nSo now when I hit that power button,\nit just turns the display off.\n\n135\n00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:14.690\nMaybe that's what you want.\n\n136\n00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:16.480\nSo you get plenty of choices here.\n\n137\n00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:21.195\nI'll just turn it back to the default for\nnow Scroll over there.\n\n138\n00:06:21.195 --> 00:06:25.115\nBut you can see with the laptop these\nare options you wouldn't see on a desktop,\n\n139\n00:06:25.115 --> 00:06:27.145\nbecause you don't have buttons like this.\n\n140\n00:06:27.145 --> 00:06:28.465\nWell, I shouldn't say that.\n\n141\n00:06:28.465 --> 00:06:32.265\nYou will see the power button options,\nbut this one when I close the lead,\n\n142\n00:06:32.265 --> 00:06:34.995\nyou wouldn't see that on a desktop, right?\n\n143\n00:06:34.995 --> 00:06:39.950\nAnd what I wanted to do Maybe I wanna\nset this up so that it goes to sleep\n\n144\n00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:43.440\nwhen I close that lid, which is what\nthe defaults are as you can see here.\n\n145\n00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:46.890\nSo that way, maybe I am at the airport and\nI am waiting for my plane, and\n\n146\n00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:48.250\nI am doing some work.\n\n147\n00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:52.420\nNot surfing the Internet, of course,\njust doing some actual work.\n\n148\n00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:54.890\nAnd all of the sudden I hear last call for\nmy plane.\n\n149\n00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:56.760\nI can simply close my lid,\n\n150\n00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:59.860\nsorry I did not mean to clap that loud\nright in the microphone for you guys.\n\n151\n00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:03.300\nBut, I can close that lid and\nlet them get on my plane, and\n\n152\n00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:08.380\nI know my laptop is basically going\nto go to sleep and save that battery.\n\n153\n00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:10.320\nNow, there's some more options down here.\n\n154\n00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:12.840\nTurn on fast start up, sleep,\n\n155\n00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:16.860\ndo I want to show that in the power menu,\nhibernate, show that in the power menu.\n\n156\n00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:20.400\nWhat they're talking about here,\nlet me zoom out,\n\n157\n00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:25.470\nis when I go to my power options here,\ndo I see, you can see sleep.\n\n158\n00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:27.540\nLet me zoom in for you.\n\n159\n00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:29.050\nI can't zoom in on the start menu.\n\n160\n00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:30.430\nIt does not zoom.\n\n161\n00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:33.820\nBut you should be able to see sleep,\nshut down, and start.\n\n162\n00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:35.510\nAll right.\n\n163\n00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:38.820\nIf I wanna add the hibernate, right?\n\n164\n00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:41.150\nActually, not letting me change that.\n\n165\n00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:46.000\nSorry I dint unlock my screen here.\n\n166\n00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.160\nSo let me put this back\nto sleep as I scroll.\n\n167\n00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:50.790\nThere we go.\n\n168\n00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:52.080\nAnd now I can add hibernate.\n\n169\n00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:53.747\nAll right.\n\n170\n00:07:53.747 --> 00:07:56.687\nSo now when I go to my start\nmenu in my power button,\n\n171\n00:07:56.687 --> 00:07:58.800\nI can see hibernate as an option.\n\n172\n00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:00.825\nSo if I want to Add that to my start menu.\n\n173\n00:08:00.825 --> 00:08:03.596\nOur user wants to be able to\nquickly go into hibernation,\n\n174\n00:08:03.596 --> 00:08:06.200\nyou can simply add that to\ntheir start menu for them.\n\n175\n00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:10.170\nSo they can quickly access that,\nall right?\n\n176\n00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:12.250\nOther choices we have over here,\n\n177\n00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:15.290\nthese are all gonna take me\nbasically to the same place, right?\n\n178\n00:08:15.290 --> 00:08:19.800\nChoose what the power buttons\ndo takes me to this screen here.\n\n179\n00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:23.638\nChoose what closing the lid does,\nit takes me to the same screen.\n\n180\n00:08:23.638 --> 00:08:27.350\nSo those are all simply hyperlinks\nover to this one screen.\n\n181\n00:08:29.010 --> 00:08:32.470\nNow in the middle,\nwe have our power plans, right?\n\n182\n00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:36.870\nWe saw in that new fancy\nUI with the settings pane,\n\n183\n00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:41.970\nwe could control the monitor, turn\nthe screen off, and when it goes to sleep.\n\n184\n00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:43.260\nBut there are more settings than that,\n\n185\n00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:46.490\nthat we can deal with and\nthose are in our power plans.\n\n186\n00:08:46.490 --> 00:08:48.700\nWe have three power plans by default.\n\n187\n00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:52.730\nYou have Balanced,\nHigh performance, and Power Saver.\n\n188\n00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:58.110\nI only see two of them here, let me zoom\nout because I cannot navigate with that.\n\n189\n00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:01.970\nI'm gonna go over to next to one of\nthese Balanced is the recommended.\n\n190\n00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:05.080\nOut of those three built-in plans,\nHigh Performance means hey,\n\n191\n00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:07.540\nwe're gonna give you\nall the power you need.\n\n192\n00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:12.750\nWe'll let that CPU run at full strength,\ndisplay is at full brightness,\n\n193\n00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:13.280\nall of that.\n\n194\n00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:17.460\nNo consideration for\npower consumption, I want performance.\n\n195\n00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:22.020\nI want everything running at\nit's best possible performance.\n\n196\n00:09:23.210 --> 00:09:24.750\nPower Saver, on the other hand,\n\n197\n00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:28.190\nwhich you don't see here, I'll show\nyou in a second is just the opposite.\n\n198\n00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:30.870\nRun everything as low as possible, right?\n\n199\n00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:36.190\nAllow me to still use my computer, but\nmaybe not give as much power to that CPU.\n\n200\n00:09:36.190 --> 00:09:37.530\nIt'll slow things down a little bit,\n\n201\n00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:40.450\nbut it'll also make my\nbattery last a lot longer.\n\n202\n00:09:40.450 --> 00:09:42.710\nMaybe dim the screen a little bit,\n\n203\n00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:45.960\nwhich can really extend\nthe life of your battery.\n\n204\n00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:49.450\n&gt;&gt; And that's really what is all comes\ndown to is trying to find little tricks\n\n205\n00:09:49.450 --> 00:09:52.620\nand tips to help us\nextend that battery life.\n\n206\n00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:56.150\nFor instance, looking at that\nsleep versus hibernation there.\n\n207\n00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:59.960\nSleep, keeping those files in RAM\nhibernation actually writes it to\n\n208\n00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:02.700\nthe disk, so\nwhich one is gonna take more memory?\n\n209\n00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:03.730\nWell, that's gonna be sleep.\n\n210\n00:10:03.730 --> 00:10:07.784\nSo using that hibernate feature that Mike\nshowed you how to put on that start menu,\n\n211\n00:10:07.784 --> 00:10:11.041\nthat's going to be a better,\na more power saving option for you.\n\n212\n00:10:11.041 --> 00:10:14.960\n&gt;&gt; Yes, a little slower to come back from,\nbut it is shutting the machine down.\n\n213\n00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:19.750\nAnd writing everything to disk, so\nyou will definitely save some battery.\n\n214\n00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:21.370\nThe Balanced is the middle one, right?\n\n215\n00:10:21.370 --> 00:10:25.110\nIt's in between the High Performance and\nPower Saver.\n\n216\n00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:26.106\nTrying to find that middle ground.\n\n217\n00:10:26.106 --> 00:10:27.151\n&gt;&gt; Middle ground.\n&gt;&gt; Exactly,\n\n218\n00:10:27.151 --> 00:10:29.140\nthat you were talking about, okay.\n\n219\n00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:32.730\nDescent performance, but\nalso descent battery life.\n\n220\n00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:34.600\nSo you can use one of\nthese pre-built plans,\n\n221\n00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:37.720\njust by selecting it,\nfrom these radio buttons here.\n\n222\n00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:40.500\nThere is a link to change plan settings,\n\n223\n00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:45.380\nthere's also a Create Power Plan\noption over here on the left.\n\n224\n00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:50.550\nSo if I click Change Plan Settings, you'll\nsee that takes me to this screen here,\n\n225\n00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:53.730\nwhich again,\ndoesn't give me a lot of options.\n\n226\n00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:57.346\nBut I noticed that I'm working with\nthe Balanced power plan, right?\n\n227\n00:10:57.346 --> 00:11:02.530\nCuz that;s the one I click next to and\nI've got On battery versus Plugged in.\n\n228\n00:11:02.530 --> 00:11:06.390\nAnd I can set the turn off, the display,\nput the computer to sleep, and\n\n229\n00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:08.790\nit's just plain brightness, right?\n\n230\n00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:12.000\nSo what this means is\nif I unplug right now,\n\n231\n00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.470\nmy screen will dim to about 50%\nautomatically because of this slider here.\n\n232\n00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:21.190\nThis is controlling how bright my\nscreen will be when I'm on battery.\n\n233\n00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:23.868\nThat doesn't prevent me from\nusing my function keys or\n\n234\n00:11:23.868 --> 00:11:25.796\nmy brightness sliders to adjust that.\n\n235\n00:11:25.796 --> 00:11:28.710\n&gt;&gt; We're just talking about\nthe default settings?\n\n236\n00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:31.950\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, that is gonna be the default\nfor what I am blog is gonna automatically\n\n237\n00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:35.270\ngood at this, and I can always\nbright the effect up if I need to.\n\n238\n00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:37.370\nOr I can come in here and\nchange this so that it doesn't do that,\n\n239\n00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:38.850\nwhich is typically what I do.\n\n240\n00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:39.910\nI'm all about-\n&gt;&gt; Really?\n\n241\n00:11:39.910 --> 00:11:43.900\n&gt;&gt; The nice bright display,\nusually depending on what I'm doing.\n\n242\n00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:46.047\nI mean, if it's in the middle of\nthe night maybe I'll drop it down.\n\n243\n00:11:46.047 --> 00:11:46.806\n&gt;&gt; Turns down a little bit.\n\n244\n00:11:46.806 --> 00:11:48.240\n&gt;&gt; But\nI love that whole night light feature.\n\n245\n00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:50.867\n&gt;&gt; And I think a lot of us probably\nare already familiar with this,\n\n246\n00:11:50.867 --> 00:11:53.257\nbecause if you think about our\ncell phones have that too.\n\n247\n00:11:53.257 --> 00:11:57.954\nWe know about cell phone batteries where\nit's like a constant struggle to keep that\n\n248\n00:11:57.954 --> 00:11:58.902\npowered up too.\n\n249\n00:11:58.902 --> 00:12:01.440\n&gt;&gt; And it's the exact same concept, right?\n\n250\n00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:05.430\nAnd you guys all should be familiar with\nthat and if you turn that screen down\n\n251\n00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:08.590\njust a little bit on that brightness,\nit can really extend.\n\n252\n00:12:08.590 --> 00:12:12.140\nI know I've been down to 10% on my phone,\nand if you drop that slider down,\n\n253\n00:12:12.140 --> 00:12:14.060\nyou can make that 10% last another hour.\n\n254\n00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:17.130\nYou can make it work, all right.\n\n255\n00:12:17.130 --> 00:12:19.556\nBut still,\nnot a whole lot of options here,\n\n256\n00:12:19.556 --> 00:12:22.254\nother than the adjust\nplan brightness is added.\n\n257\n00:12:22.254 --> 00:12:24.740\nBut you're still just seeing display and\nsleep.\n\n258\n00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:27.230\nSo where are all these power settings?\n\n259\n00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:29.582\nWell, it's buried them down,\nand let me zoom out so\n\n260\n00:12:29.582 --> 00:12:31.140\nyou can see where I'm at, right?\n\n261\n00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:33.640\nSo, I'm gonna jump back\nout to Power Options.\n\n262\n00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:36.200\nWhere did I go here?\n\n263\n00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:38.070\n&gt;&gt; We need a little\nwhere's Waldo to pop out.\n\n264\n00:12:38.070 --> 00:12:39.654\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; Whenever\nwe find the right setting.\n\n265\n00:12:39.654 --> 00:12:41.830\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Am I in the middle of changing that?\n\n266\n00:12:41.830 --> 00:12:45.610\nThere we go let me go back\nout to the main screen.\n\n267\n00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:49.140\nLet's change this up.\n\n268\n00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:52.530\nSorry, I got lost in my-\n&gt;&gt; Navigation.\n\n269\n00:12:52.530 --> 00:12:54.220\n&gt;&gt; Navigation, there we go.\n\n270\n00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:58.014\nActually one of my plan has\ndisappeared from my screen and\n\n271\n00:12:58.014 --> 00:13:00.310\nI'm not exactly sure why.\n\n272\n00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:04.600\nBut we'll keep going with this, so\nchange plans settings again takes me here.\n\n273\n00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:09.680\nNow, the rest of the settings are right\nhere underneath this Change advance\n\n274\n00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:10.595\npower settings.\n\n275\n00:13:10.595 --> 00:13:15.560\nIf I click that, that takes me to\nwhat you all might be familiar with\n\n276\n00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:19.420\nif you've worked with this in previous\nversions of the operating system.\n\n277\n00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:21.050\nHere I can see I gotta drop-down list,\n\n278\n00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:25.050\nwhich is actually just showing\nme the balanced at this point.\n\n279\n00:13:25.050 --> 00:13:27.820\nBut now I have many more options, right?\n\n280\n00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:32.380\nTurn off the hard disk after On battery,\n10 minutes.\n\n281\n00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:33.570\nPlugged in, 20 minutes.\n\n282\n00:13:33.570 --> 00:13:37.770\nIf I want to change that,\nI can change that to 30 minutes, right?\n\n283\n00:13:37.770 --> 00:13:41.210\nSo I'm now modifying this Balanced plan,\nall right?\n\n284\n00:13:42.630 --> 00:13:44.330\nThere are lots of settings and\n\n285\n00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:48.480\nI'm not gonna go through every one of\nthese settings, you can see Power buttons.\n\n286\n00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:52.310\nSame settings that we were seeing\non the other screen all right?\n\n287\n00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:55.240\nRight behind me here\n&gt;&gt; Just a lot more options\n\n288\n00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:56.770\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, these settings right here\n\n289\n00:13:56.770 --> 00:13:58.450\nare the same as these right here.\n\n290\n00:13:58.450 --> 00:14:01.200\nSo if I change these, oops,\n\n291\n00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:04.120\nI'm sorry that's actually the screen\nbrightness, but you get the idea.\n\n292\n00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:07.270\nIt's all looking at the same power plan.\n\n293\n00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:09.542\nBut yeah, a lot more options.\n\n294\n00:14:09.542 --> 00:14:12.690\nI'm again zoom that navigation\nis driving me crazy.\n\n295\n00:14:12.690 --> 00:14:16.770\nAll right, you can also roll back if you\nwanna restore your default settings for\n\n296\n00:14:16.770 --> 00:14:17.730\nthis plan.\n\n297\n00:14:17.730 --> 00:14:21.480\nI can simply click Restore default,\nand that'll go back to the original.\n\n298\n00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:25.140\nNotice I've changed now to 5 minutes,\n15 minutes, 10, and 30.\n\n299\n00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:28.056\nSo those are the defaults for that plan.\n\n300\n00:14:28.056 --> 00:14:30.900\nAll right, let me go ahead and\ncancel out of that and\n\n301\n00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:33.060\nnow we're gonna be looking\nat creating a power plan.\n\n302\n00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:37.480\nSo we can modify the existing plans\nwhich is usually good enough, right?\n\n303\n00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:41.638\nI start with one of them and then tweak\nit that's usually the way to go, but\n\n304\n00:14:41.638 --> 00:14:43.664\nyou can create your own power plan.\n\n305\n00:14:43.664 --> 00:14:46.020\nYou simply choose Create a power plan and\n\n306\n00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:50.370\nthere's the three that I was\ntalking about, the defaults.\n\n307\n00:14:50.370 --> 00:14:54.610\nThose are gonna act like templates,\nBalanced, Power saver, and\n\n308\n00:14:54.610 --> 00:14:55.900\nHigh Performance.\n\n309\n00:14:55.900 --> 00:14:59.960\nAnd so I would choose start with\nan existing plan and give it a name.\n\n310\n00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:05.628\nI would say, let's do balanced and I'm\ngonna call this one maybe something like\n\n311\n00:15:05.628 --> 00:15:12.660\nMike balanced plan or something like\nthat and then we will click Next.\n\n312\n00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:15.000\nAnd you can see I have got my settings.\n\n313\n00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:19.300\nAnd here is what is interesting, as you\ngo to create this thinking I'm gonna move\n\n314\n00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:23.460\nthis fancy custom plan, and\nI get a whole lot of three options.\n\n315\n00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:24.605\nIt's all I get.\n\n316\n00:15:24.605 --> 00:15:26.475\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Brightness, display, and\n\n317\n00:15:26.475 --> 00:15:27.940\nput the computer to sleep.\n\n318\n00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:32.100\n&gt;&gt; Well, you can have that brightness that\nyou're just, ideal perfect level Mike.\n\n319\n00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:37.590\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so, but don't worry,\nthis is just you have to create it first.\n\n320\n00:15:37.590 --> 00:15:40.390\nThen you can go back in and\nedit all of those other settings.\n\n321\n00:15:40.390 --> 00:15:41.055\n&gt;&gt; Add those sections okay cool.\n\n322\n00:15:41.055 --> 00:15:44.800\n&gt;&gt; All those settings are available you\njust don't see them during the creation.\n\n323\n00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:50.462\nSo once I click Create, now I'm gonna\nsee my balance show up in this list.\n\n324\n00:15:50.462 --> 00:15:55.040\nAnd I can click Change plan settings,\nI see those three big settings.\n\n325\n00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:57.439\nBut I can click Change\nadvance power settings And\n\n326\n00:15:57.439 --> 00:16:00.612\nthen here's all those myriad of\noptions that I have available.\n\n327\n00:16:00.612 --> 00:16:04.515\nSo you can customize your power\nplan to your heart's content.\n\n328\n00:16:04.515 --> 00:16:08.951\nYou just have to create it first,\ncopy one of the existing,\n\n329\n00:16:08.951 --> 00:16:14.030\ngive it a name, create it,\nthen go back in and edit that Power Plan.\n\n330\n00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:19.167\nSo that is power plans through Windows,\nas far as what it allows me to do in here.\n\n331\n00:16:19.167 --> 00:16:21.223\nWe've got three built-in plans.\n\n332\n00:16:21.223 --> 00:16:23.359\nI can modify those existing plans.\n\n333\n00:16:23.359 --> 00:16:26.923\nI can create my own plan based\noff of one of those, and\n\n334\n00:16:26.923 --> 00:16:30.256\nI showed you how to adjust\nall of those settings.\n\n335\n00:16:30.256 --> 00:16:32.770\nThis slider down here,\njust to let you know,\n\n336\n00:16:32.770 --> 00:16:35.625\nthis slider down here will\nadjust your power plan.\n\n337\n00:16:35.625 --> 00:16:40.500\nMy current plan is My Balanced,\nand you'll see that plugged in.\n\n338\n00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:43.330\nIt's set to full brightness there.\n\n339\n00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:44.770\nAnd I cancel out of that.\n\n340\n00:16:44.770 --> 00:16:47.979\nI'm going to adjust this\ndown to about half way,\n\n341\n00:16:47.979 --> 00:16:50.898\nwhich I know might dim\non my screen up there.\n\n342\n00:16:50.898 --> 00:16:54.973\nBut if I go to Change plan settings,\nnotice it's set at half way now,\n\n343\n00:16:54.973 --> 00:16:55.688\nall right?\n\n344\n00:16:55.688 --> 00:17:00.199\nSo when you change your brightness,\nwhatever power plan is active,\n\n345\n00:17:00.199 --> 00:17:05.610\nit's gonna remember that, and\nit considers that your new setting.\n\n346\n00:17:05.610 --> 00:17:07.180\nJust a little FYI there.\n\n347\n00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:10.345\nYou don't have to go all the way into\nChange plan settings to change your\n\n348\n00:17:10.345 --> 00:17:10.990\nbrightness.\n\n349\n00:17:10.990 --> 00:17:15.487\nEven using your keyboard shortcuts\nif you have those, all right?\n\n350\n00:17:15.487 --> 00:17:17.325\nYou can see me turn the brightness down.\n\n351\n00:17:17.325 --> 00:17:21.085\nThat's actually adjusting my power plan,\nit will remember that setting.\n\n352\n00:17:22.725 --> 00:17:26.808\nAll right, so that takes care\nof the power options there.\n\n353\n00:17:26.808 --> 00:17:30.406\nI wanna go back out to our new interface,\nand\n\n354\n00:17:30.406 --> 00:17:34.220\nI wanna take a look at this battery node.\n\n355\n00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:37.010\nSo again, Settings and then System.\n\n356\n00:17:37.010 --> 00:17:39.838\nI can get into my Power &amp; Sleep,\nwhich we just looked at.\n\n357\n00:17:39.838 --> 00:17:43.699\nI can link, I think I showed you this,\nAdditional power settings,\n\n358\n00:17:43.699 --> 00:17:46.623\nthat is gonna take you out to the-\n&gt;&gt; More advanced settings?\n\n359\n00:17:46.623 --> 00:17:48.169\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think it must have it open.\n\n360\n00:17:48.169 --> 00:17:49.286\nIt's just not going anywhere.\n\n361\n00:17:54.157 --> 00:17:55.557\nIt's not playing along, but\n\n362\n00:17:55.557 --> 00:17:58.864\nthat takes you back out to those\nadvanced settings we were looking at.\n\n363\n00:17:58.864 --> 00:17:59.837\nBut under Battery,\n\n364\n00:17:59.837 --> 00:18:03.108\nthis is one of those things that\nyou won't see on a desktop, right?\n\n365\n00:18:03.108 --> 00:18:05.656\nIt's gonna depend on whether\nyou're on a mobile device or\n\n366\n00:18:05.656 --> 00:18:07.122\na device that has a battery in it.\n\n367\n00:18:07.122 --> 00:18:09.541\nI can get some information,\nlike battery usage.\n\n368\n00:18:09.541 --> 00:18:12.404\nI can see I'm sitting at 100%,\nso I'm fully charged.\n\n369\n00:18:12.404 --> 00:18:14.754\nI have this Battery usage by app.\n\n370\n00:18:14.754 --> 00:18:16.989\nThis is a really cool little report.\n\n371\n00:18:16.989 --> 00:18:21.043\nIt shows me what applications\nare using the most power.\n\n372\n00:18:21.043 --> 00:18:23.727\nAnd I can choose by time period,\nall right?\n\n373\n00:18:23.727 --> 00:18:30.940\nI can do Show apps with usage, All apps,\nor Always allowed apps, just kinda nice.\n\n374\n00:18:30.940 --> 00:18:33.948\nYou might find that you have an app that's\nusing a lot more power than you thought.\n\n375\n00:18:33.948 --> 00:18:37.034\nMaybe it's reaching out in\nthe background doing refreshes or\n\n376\n00:18:37.034 --> 00:18:39.594\nupdates, to show you that live tile or\nsomething.\n\n377\n00:18:39.594 --> 00:18:41.736\nAnd it's consuming a lot of battery power.\n\n378\n00:18:41.736 --> 00:18:43.980\nSo maybe you wanna stop that, all right?\n\n379\n00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:46.341\nNo notifications for\nbattery life right now,\n\n380\n00:18:46.341 --> 00:18:48.345\nI think my battery is relatively good.\n\n381\n00:18:48.345 --> 00:18:50.682\nI also have this Battery Saver\noption down here.\n\n382\n00:18:50.682 --> 00:18:54.432\nExtend my battery life by\nlimiting background activity, and\n\n383\n00:18:54.432 --> 00:18:57.830\npush notifications when your\ndevice is low on battery.\n\n384\n00:18:57.830 --> 00:18:59.598\nNotice this is turned on by default.\n\n385\n00:18:59.598 --> 00:19:04.468\nAnd so what Windows is gonna do is stop\nall those live tiles from going out and\n\n386\n00:19:04.468 --> 00:19:08.181\nrefreshing and\npulling in the latest weather and news and\n\n387\n00:19:08.181 --> 00:19:13.771\nwhatever it is you have on those tiles, if\nyour battery falls below this percentage.\n\n388\n00:19:13.771 --> 00:19:17.553\nSo once my battery gets to 20%,\na lot of those background activities will-\n\n389\n00:19:17.553 --> 00:19:18.895\n&gt;&gt; Starts to ration itself, like help me!\n\n390\n00:19:18.895 --> 00:19:21.930\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so you can adjust this.\n\n391\n00:19:21.930 --> 00:19:25.968\nIf you don't want that until it gets down\nto 10% maybe, then you can slide that.\n\n392\n00:19:25.968 --> 00:19:29.700\nOr if you want that stuff to stop at 50%,\nyou can do that as well.\n\n393\n00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:33.633\nSo you're free to adjust what\nit considers low battery and\n\n394\n00:19:33.633 --> 00:19:38.622\nwhen it's going to stop those apps\nfrom doing that background activity.\n\n395\n00:19:38.622 --> 00:19:41.720\nYou can also lower screen\nbrightness while in battery saver.\n\n396\n00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:46.590\nSo once it gets to that 20% and we kick\nin battery saver, not only will my apps\n\n397\n00:19:46.590 --> 00:19:51.760\nstop refreshing in the background,\nI can lower that screen brightness.\n\n398\n00:19:53.250 --> 00:19:55.699\nSo a bunch of settings, again,\n\n399\n00:19:55.699 --> 00:20:01.803\nall about Windows on our mobile devices\nbeing able to extend that battery life.\n\n400\n00:20:01.803 --> 00:20:03.283\nAll right, Cherokee,\n\n401\n00:20:03.283 --> 00:20:07.655\nnext thing I wanna show you is\nsomething that we don't see that often.\n\n402\n00:20:07.655 --> 00:20:13.892\nAnd that is a command line utility\nknown as powercfg, all right?\n\n403\n00:20:13.892 --> 00:20:18.294\npowercfg, and let me do a little switch,\nquestion mark, and\n\n404\n00:20:18.294 --> 00:20:23.470\nyou'll see that there are several\noptions that I can use with this tool.\n\n405\n00:20:23.470 --> 00:20:27.763\nBut this allows me to get access to those\npower settings from a command line.\n\n406\n00:20:27.763 --> 00:20:34.417\nSo you can list, I want to mention this,\nthey do call this out on the objectives.\n\n407\n00:20:34.417 --> 00:20:37.090\nI will tell you that I\ndon't use this very often.\n\n408\n00:20:37.090 --> 00:20:41.606\nI find it just as easy to go into\nthe GUI and make those adjustments.\n\n409\n00:20:41.606 --> 00:20:44.883\nIf you're working with it here,\nyou've gotta know the GUID for\n\n410\n00:20:44.883 --> 00:20:47.660\nthe power plan that\nyou're wanting to modify.\n\n411\n00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:49.604\nIt can be-\n&gt;&gt; A bit cumbersome to find that.\n\n412\n00:20:49.604 --> 00:20:51.770\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, which is kind of weird.\n\n413\n00:20:51.770 --> 00:20:54.390\nBut it does give you some great reports.\n\n414\n00:20:54.390 --> 00:20:55.920\nI do wanna show you that.\n\n415\n00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:59.511\nSo you can do a /list or l for short.\n\n416\n00:20:59.511 --> 00:21:02.808\nAnd it'll show you your\ncurrent power plans.\n\n417\n00:21:02.808 --> 00:21:06.487\nAnd you can see my balance and\nthere is an asterisk next to it.\n\n418\n00:21:06.487 --> 00:21:11.140\nAnd that is showing me that that is\nthe current active power plan, right?\n\n419\n00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:17.730\nAnd if I wanted to make changes to one\nof those plans, you can use set value.\n\n420\n00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:23.378\nOr let's see, SETACTIVE is how\nyou can change power plans.\n\n421\n00:21:23.378 --> 00:21:27.190\nQUERY gives you the contents\nof a power's plan.\n\n422\n00:21:27.190 --> 00:21:30.750\nCHANGE allows me to change one of those.\n\n423\n00:21:30.750 --> 00:21:33.867\nBut you have to know the options.\n\n424\n00:21:33.867 --> 00:21:41.150\nIf we go into, let's see if I can get\nit to show you, /change, all lright.\n\n425\n00:21:41.150 --> 00:21:44.410\nThese are the options that\nI can change using this.\n\n426\n00:21:44.410 --> 00:21:51.085\nYou do /change, name of the parameter that\nyou wanna change, monitor timeout ac.\n\n427\n00:21:51.085 --> 00:21:55.380\nThis is when I'm gonna turn off\nthe display when I'm plugged in, right?\n\n428\n00:21:55.380 --> 00:21:58.678\nMonitor timeout dc,\nwhen I'm gonna change or\n\n429\n00:21:58.678 --> 00:22:01.648\nturn off the screen when I'm on battery.\n\n430\n00:22:01.648 --> 00:22:04.290\nSo these are the same settings\nyou're seeing in the GUI,\n\n431\n00:22:04.290 --> 00:22:05.619\njust from the command line.\n\n432\n00:22:05.619 --> 00:22:08.451\nSo I can come in here and\nI could make changes to those values.\n\n433\n00:22:08.451 --> 00:22:12.227\n&gt;&gt; And it seems like if you're already\nworking in a graphical user interface,\n\n434\n00:22:12.227 --> 00:22:15.000\nby the time you memorize these options and\neverything,\n\n435\n00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.374\nit might just be easier to go ahead and\nset that.\n\n436\n00:22:17.374 --> 00:22:19.333\nAnd then I'm trying to think, okay, well,\n\n437\n00:22:19.333 --> 00:22:21.922\nwhen would this be ideal to use\nthe command line interface?\n\n438\n00:22:21.922 --> 00:22:25.780\nIf I was working maybe on the server\nthat was plugged in constantly?\n\n439\n00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:27.917\nBut then you wouldn't really be so\n\n440\n00:22:27.917 --> 00:22:33.149\nconcerned with power options because you\nhave other additional power generators,\n\n441\n00:22:33.149 --> 00:22:36.110\nand backup power should\nbe configured anyway.\n\n442\n00:22:36.110 --> 00:22:39.162\nSo I'm just trying to find when\nthis would be the best situation.\n\n443\n00:22:39.162 --> 00:22:41.576\n&gt;&gt; You would use this if you\nare trying to automate something.\n\n444\n00:22:41.576 --> 00:22:46.327\nIf you wanted to be able to write a\nscript, and Joe employee has a laptop, and\n\n445\n00:22:46.327 --> 00:22:50.707\nyou wanted to adjust their power plans and\nyou wanted to do it quickly,\n\n446\n00:22:50.707 --> 00:22:53.398\nyou could have all this\npreset in a script.\n\n447\n00:22:53.398 --> 00:22:54.504\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n448\n00:22:54.504 --> 00:22:57.942\n&gt;&gt; And then run that against his machine,\nrather than going through the GUI and\n\n449\n00:22:57.942 --> 00:22:58.703\ndoing all that.\n\n450\n00:22:58.703 --> 00:22:59.287\n&gt;&gt; In Remote Desktop.\n\n451\n00:22:59.287 --> 00:23:00.750\n&gt;&gt; So that would be the main thing.\n\n452\n00:23:00.750 --> 00:23:04.050\nIf this was your laptop, most likely\nyou're not gonna be doing this.\n\n453\n00:23:04.050 --> 00:23:07.122\nBut if you're at a help desk,\nthey might have a script for\n\n454\n00:23:07.122 --> 00:23:10.962\nyou already built that you need to\nrun on all newly formatted machines,\n\n455\n00:23:10.962 --> 00:23:14.615\nto set those laptops or power options,\nor whatever the case may be.\n\n456\n00:23:14.615 --> 00:23:15.884\nThat'd be the only thing\nthat I could think of,\n\n457\n00:23:15.884 --> 00:23:17.042\nif you were trying to automate something.\n\n458\n00:23:17.042 --> 00:23:19.399\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay.\n\n459\n00:23:19.399 --> 00:23:21.394\n&gt;&gt; But\nI do love the reporting capabilities.\n\n460\n00:23:21.394 --> 00:23:24.430\nI'll go back up to where I ran\nthat switch question mark.\n\n461\n00:23:24.430 --> 00:23:28.500\nThere's this battery report,\ngenerates a report of battery usage.\n\n462\n00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:30.911\nThere is a sleep study [LAUGH].\n\n463\n00:23:30.911 --> 00:23:32.023\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I like that one.\n\n464\n00:23:32.023 --> 00:23:36.064\nCuz I wanna go apply for the sleep study,\n[LAUGH] do a little dream study.\n\n465\n00:23:36.064 --> 00:23:39.766\nBut generates a diagnostic\nsystem power transition report.\n\n466\n00:23:39.766 --> 00:23:43.539\nIt shows me, hey, when it went to sleep,\nwhat woke it up from sleep.\n\n467\n00:23:43.539 --> 00:23:48.164\nThe system sleep diagnostics is your sleep\n\n468\n00:23:48.164 --> 00:23:53.310\ntransitions, system power report, energy.\n\n469\n00:23:53.310 --> 00:23:58.010\nAnalyze the system for common energy\nefficiency and battery life problems.\n\n470\n00:23:58.010 --> 00:24:00.940\nWake timers,\nenumerate all your current wake timers.\n\n471\n00:24:00.940 --> 00:24:04.900\nWhat are things that can\nwake it from sleep state?\n\n472\n00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:06.950\nWhen did it last wake up?\n\n473\n00:24:06.950 --> 00:24:12.465\nAnd when you run these, like I'll do one,\nlet's do, what's a good one to do?\n\n474\n00:24:12.465 --> 00:24:16.230\n/SYSTEMPOWERREPORT I\nthink would be a fun one.\n\n475\n00:24:16.230 --> 00:24:19.270\nLet's do powercfg.\n\n476\n00:24:19.270 --> 00:24:23.640\n&gt;&gt; While you're typing, we did have\nsomeone in chat give a great example also.\n\n477\n00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:26.555\nSo for computers that aren't\nmanaged via group policy,\n\n478\n00:24:26.555 --> 00:24:30.520\nmaybe like kiosk computers too, so\nI think that one, thanks, Mike.\n\n479\n00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:32.080\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, very true.\n\n480\n00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:33.525\n&gt;&gt; Let's do battery report.\n\n481\n00:24:33.525 --> 00:24:35.757\nThat'll be a good one to start with.\n\n482\n00:24:41.352 --> 00:24:46.410\nAnd what it's gonna do is generate\nthis HTML file, all right?\n\n483\n00:24:46.410 --> 00:24:49.899\nSo let's see if we can't that read guy.\n\n484\n00:24:53.728 --> 00:24:54.548\nAnd here's my report.\n\n485\n00:24:54.548 --> 00:24:59.783\nI can see the information about my system,\nwhat battery is in there.\n\n486\n00:24:59.783 --> 00:25:03.706\nThis is great if you're trying\nto get a replacement battery and\n\n487\n00:25:03.706 --> 00:25:07.934\nyou need to know that exact model and\npower options on that battery.\n\n488\n00:25:07.934 --> 00:25:15.040\nThis is 71,995 milliwatts an hour,\nwhatever, recent usage, right?\n\n489\n00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:17.810\nSo a lot of cool reports and\nit's a really impressive report.\n\n490\n00:25:17.810 --> 00:25:19.433\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, look at that, it's really pretty.\n\n491\n00:25:19.433 --> 00:25:22.195\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's really nicely formatted.\n\n492\n00:25:22.195 --> 00:25:25.069\nLike I said,\nI have used the ones for sleep,\n\n493\n00:25:25.069 --> 00:25:28.110\ntry to figure out what\nis causing the problem.\n\n494\n00:25:28.110 --> 00:25:30.594\nUsed to have an issue with my laptop,\nit was going to sleep and\n\n495\n00:25:30.594 --> 00:25:32.027\nthen it didn't wake up properly.\n\n496\n00:25:32.027 --> 00:25:36.713\nHave used these reports to help diagnose\nwhat it was that was preventing it from\n\n497\n00:25:36.713 --> 00:25:40.330\nwaking up properly, so\nsome great information here.\n\n498\n00:25:40.330 --> 00:25:43.562\nOr if a user comes to you and\nsays, look, my laptop,\n\n499\n00:25:43.562 --> 00:25:48.000\nit only last 45 minutes when I'm\nunplugged, what is going on?\n\n500\n00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:49.830\nAnd you need to start doing\nsome troubleshooting, and\n\n501\n00:25:49.830 --> 00:25:53.270\nsee if you need to replace the battery or\nis it a setting\n\n502\n00:25:53.270 --> 00:25:56.480\nthat has become misconfigured and\nI can go in here and adjust it.\n\n503\n00:25:56.480 --> 00:26:01.710\nThese reports can help us kinda narrow\ndown and find that information.\n\n504\n00:26:01.710 --> 00:26:03.347\nAll right, so lots of options there.\n\n505\n00:26:03.347 --> 00:26:07.147\nI'm not gonna run all the different\nreports, go check those out.\n\n506\n00:26:07.147 --> 00:26:12.282\nThe main thing is to do some run power\nCFG, at least to a switch question mark,\n\n507\n00:26:12.282 --> 00:26:15.612\nand be familiar with what\noptions are available.\n\n508\n00:26:15.612 --> 00:26:18.434\nThat'd be the kinda thing they\nmight ask you on an the exa.\n\n509\n00:26:18.434 --> 00:26:20.220\nI would be familiar with list.\n\n510\n00:26:20.220 --> 00:26:22.330\nThis shows you all your power schemes.\n\n511\n00:26:22.330 --> 00:26:26.875\nQuery, which displays\nthe contents of a power scheme.\n\n512\n00:26:26.875 --> 00:26:31.269\nSo you could see your power schemes\nthemselves, and you can see the details\n\n513\n00:26:31.269 --> 00:26:35.188\nof the different power schemes,\nsay that, using those options.\n\n514\n00:26:35.188 --> 00:26:39.708\nAll right, last thing I wanna show you,\nI know we're getting short on time here,\n\n515\n00:26:39.708 --> 00:26:41.749\nis some of the group policy options.\n\n516\n00:26:41.749 --> 00:26:44.911\nAnd I'll go through these\nrelatively quick since, again,\n\n517\n00:26:44.911 --> 00:26:47.454\nthis is a Windows 10\nexam we're studying for.\n\n518\n00:26:47.454 --> 00:26:49.696\nBut I want you to see\nthe server side of things, so\n\n519\n00:26:49.696 --> 00:26:52.400\nyou understand what's going on back there.\n\n520\n00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:56.360\nI'm gonna open up group policy management\ncuz you might be troubleshooting a laptop\n\n521\n00:26:56.360 --> 00:27:00.220\nand find out that I wanna go change\nthose power settings but I can't, right?\n\n522\n00:27:00.220 --> 00:27:01.980\nThey're grayed out, they're locked.\n\n523\n00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:05.000\nAnd that's because group policy\ncan be used to control those\n\n524\n00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:06.780\npower settings as well.\n\n525\n00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:12.350\nNow you can't create policies,\nper se, with a group policy.\n\n526\n00:27:12.350 --> 00:27:15.890\nYou can, however,\ncreate them with group policy preferences.\n\n527\n00:27:15.890 --> 00:27:18.430\nBut there are some options I can\ncontrol through group policy.\n\n528\n00:27:18.430 --> 00:27:20.337\nAll right, so\nI'm just gonna edit my lab policy here.\n\n529\n00:27:20.337 --> 00:27:21.921\nIt really doesn't matter\nwhich policy I use.\n\n530\n00:27:21.921 --> 00:27:24.208\nJust wanna show you where\nthese settings are and\n\n531\n00:27:24.208 --> 00:27:28.039\nwhat can be done using group policy again\nto help us out to understand when we're\n\n532\n00:27:28.039 --> 00:27:31.380\nlooking at in a Windows 10 machine,\nwhy are some settings locked.\n\n533\n00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:33.830\nOr why are these not in their defaults?\n\n534\n00:27:33.830 --> 00:27:37.770\nSo, in my policy, I'll zoom in,\nhopefully you can see this.\n\n535\n00:27:37.770 --> 00:27:39.743\nI'm gonna go underneath\nthe computer configuration.\n\n536\n00:27:39.743 --> 00:27:46.130\nPolicies &gt; Administrative Templates\n&gt; System &gt; and then\n\n537\n00:27:46.130 --> 00:27:52.510\nwe're gonna go down to, I'll scroll over\nso you can see that, Power Management.\n\n538\n00:27:52.510 --> 00:27:56.206\nAnd now here in the details area,\nI've got two options,\n\n539\n00:27:56.206 --> 00:28:00.604\nselect an active power plan and\nspecify a custom active power plan.\n\n540\n00:28:00.604 --> 00:28:02.509\nSo here, I can pick my balanced.\n\n541\n00:28:02.509 --> 00:28:08.990\nAnd if I double-click on select an active\npower plan, I can choose Enabled.\n\n542\n00:28:08.990 --> 00:28:12.820\nAnd then I can pick High Performance,\nPower Saver, Automatic,\n\n543\n00:28:12.820 --> 00:28:14.980\nwhich is really the balanced one.\n\n544\n00:28:14.980 --> 00:28:17.770\nI'm gonna cancel that and\nnot make any changes there.\n\n545\n00:28:17.770 --> 00:28:21.520\nI can also specify a custom\nactive power plan.\n\n546\n00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:25.110\nYou would need to make the power plan,\nhave that plan available, know the GUID\n\n547\n00:28:25.110 --> 00:28:30.320\nfor that power plan, cuz that is what\nyou're gonna specify here in this policy.\n\n548\n00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:33.846\nAnd then all of these other nodes are just\nthose settings we were looking at earlier\n\n549\n00:28:33.846 --> 00:28:35.270\nfrom the client side.\n\n550\n00:28:35.270 --> 00:28:38.188\nSelect the power button\naction when it's plugged in.\n\n551\n00:28:38.188 --> 00:28:42.712\nSelect the power button action\nwhen it's on battery, all right?\n\n552\n00:28:42.712 --> 00:28:44.240\nWhat do I want the sleep button to do?\n\n553\n00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:46.650\nWhat does the start menu power button do?\n\n554\n00:28:46.650 --> 00:28:49.600\nIf I go over here to hard disk settings,\nwhen do I turn the hard disk?\n\n555\n00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:50.800\nWhen it's plugged in.\n\n556\n00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:51.680\nWhen do I turn it off?\n\n557\n00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:52.980\nWhen it's on battery.\n\n558\n00:28:52.980 --> 00:28:54.140\nSo nothing new, right?\n\n559\n00:28:54.140 --> 00:28:58.632\nThese are all the same settings you\nare seeing from that Windows 10 side, but\n\n560\n00:28:58.632 --> 00:29:02.464\nas an organization,\nwe don't wanna touch every single machine.\n\n561\n00:29:02.464 --> 00:29:06.314\nI wanna be able to configure all of those\nsalespeoples' laptops by using a policy.\n\n562\n00:29:06.314 --> 00:29:10.370\nSo this is how you're gonna do it many\ntimes in a corporate environment.\n\n563\n00:29:10.370 --> 00:29:13.219\nNow on the exam,\ntheir favorite thing to say is,\n\n564\n00:29:13.219 --> 00:29:17.810\nhow would you accomplish this with\nthe least administrative effort?\n\n565\n00:29:17.810 --> 00:29:19.450\nAnd that means you're\ngonna be using policy,\n\n566\n00:29:19.450 --> 00:29:22.920\nyou're not gonna be touching\nevery single machine, right?\n\n567\n00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:24.280\nAll right, last thing I wanna show you.\n\n568\n00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:28.990\nI promise there is no way to\ncreate power plans through here.\n\n569\n00:29:28.990 --> 00:29:31.570\nI showed you, you can specify a custom.\n\n570\n00:29:31.570 --> 00:29:36.200\nBut that just means telling it what\nthe GUID is of an existing power plan,\n\n571\n00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:37.240\nthat's no fun.\n\n572\n00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:40.950\nWe can create power plans through\nhere using group policy preferences.\n\n573\n00:29:40.950 --> 00:29:42.124\nAnd I'll just show you where it is.\n\n574\n00:29:42.124 --> 00:29:46.270\nI'll go down to Preferences and\nlet me scroll up so\n\n575\n00:29:46.270 --> 00:29:48.290\nI can zoom in a little bit here.\n\n576\n00:29:48.290 --> 00:29:54.450\nAnd then we're gonna go in to\nControl Panel &gt; Power Options.\n\n577\n00:29:54.450 --> 00:29:57.615\nNow we'll talk a lot\nmore about Preferences,\n\n578\n00:29:57.615 --> 00:30:03.308\nhow are different from group policies when\nwe get into our server classes, right?\n\n579\n00:30:03.308 --> 00:30:09.547\nBut just so you can see, I can\nright-click here, New &gt; Power Options.\n\n580\n00:30:09.547 --> 00:30:16.035\nAnd I will wanna do Windows 7, cuz that's\ngonna be for my Windows 10 machines.\n\n581\n00:30:16.035 --> 00:30:19.092\nAnd I'll zoom back out, and\nthis should look familiar, right?\n\n582\n00:30:19.092 --> 00:30:21.630\nThis is that same screen we\nwere looking at from the client\n\n583\n00:30:21.630 --> 00:30:24.348\nside when I wanted to\ndo a custom power plan.\n\n584\n00:30:24.348 --> 00:30:27.940\nAnd I wanted to look at all those advanced\nsettings, I have them all right here.\n\n585\n00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:31.590\nSo I could go through, configure\nall of this power plan options and\n\n586\n00:30:31.590 --> 00:30:34.880\nthen set it to replace their\nexisting power plan, so\n\n587\n00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:39.440\nthat I can use to create a custom plan and\nassign it to those machines.\n\n588\n00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:42.180\nSo that takes care of really,\nCherokee, of our power options.\n\n589\n00:30:42.180 --> 00:30:45.750\nWe've taken a look at how I can\nconfigure those from the laptop,\n\n590\n00:30:45.750 --> 00:30:49.600\nfrom the device as an individual laptop.\n\n591\n00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:52.510\nAlso wanted to show you a little bit\nabout the group policy side of things\n\n592\n00:30:52.510 --> 00:30:54.590\nwhere we can configure this\non an enterprise level.\n\n593\n00:30:54.590 --> 00:30:56.620\n&gt;&gt; Great information as always, Mike.\n\n594\n00:30:56.620 --> 00:31:01.600\nI'm feeling a little guilty here because I\nknow my power settings are not optimized.\n\n595\n00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:04.370\nSo now they should be from everything\nthat you've shown us today, but\n\n596\n00:31:04.370 --> 00:31:05.400\nthank you so much.\n\n597\n00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:08.600\nThank you guys for joining us, but\nwe are out of time, so let's sign out.\n\n598\n00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:10.040\nI've been your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n599\n00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:10.789\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n600\n00:31:10.789 --> 00:31:14.464\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n601\n00:31:14.464 --> 00:31:20.121\n[MUSIC]\n\n602\n00:31:20.121 --> 00:31:23.559\n&gt;&gt;

we'll continue taking\na look at the different mobility options.\n\n9\n00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:27.220\nAnd, of course,\nwith us today back in studios, we have Mr.\n\n10\n00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.629\nMike Roderick, how's it going, Mike?\n\n11\n00:00:29.629 --> 00:00:32.052\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing good, Cherokee,\nthanks for having me back,\n\n12\n00:00:32.052 --> 00:00:34.780\nexcited to be talking about good\nold Windows mobility options.\n\n13\n00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:37.670\n&gt;&gt; I know,\nI feel like we're in the same studio.\n\n14\n00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.660\nWe need to go roving and\nbe a little more mobile with this show.\n\n15\n00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:41.793\n&gt;&gt; We are not very mobile, are we?\n\n16\n00:00:41.793 --> 00:00:43.488\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So the next time you see us,\n\n17\n00:00:43.488 --> 00:00:45.130\nmaybe we'll be at the beach.\n\n18\n00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:48.856\nAnd if we were at the beach and\nwanting to do shows, how could we?\n\n19\n00:00:48.856 --> 00:00:52.430\nWell, we could use this great\ntechnology known as Windows To Go.\n\n20\n00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:54.546\nI don't know if that was\na great segue into it, but hey,\n\n21\n00:00:54.546 --> 00:00:55.592\nwe're going to go with it.\n\n22\n00:00:55.592 --> 00:00:57.870\n&gt;&gt; It is an option, though,\nwe do have that option.\n\n23\n00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.260\n&gt;&gt; It is an option, right?\n\n24\n00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.590\nSo that's what we're here to talk about\ntoday is something known as Windows To Go.\n\n25\n00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:05.334\nIt's been around for\na couple of versions of Windows,\n\n26\n00:01:05.334 --> 00:01:08.806\nI believe starting with 8 maybe or\n8.1, don't quote me on that.\n\n27\n00:01:08.806 --> 00:01:12.889\nBut it's definitely here on Windows 10,\nand that's what we're studying for,\n\n28\n00:01:12.889 --> 00:01:16.520\nall right, is that 70-697 exam for\nconfiguring Windows devices.\n\n29\n00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.714\nSo first let's talk about what\nthe heck Windows To Go is.\n\n30\n00:01:20.714 --> 00:01:21.858\nAnd what it is,\n\n31\n00:01:21.858 --> 00:01:27.110\nis a way to install Windows\noperating system on removable media.\n\n32\n00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.198\nAnd then be able to take\nthat with me wherever I go,\n\n33\n00:01:30.198 --> 00:01:33.446\nhence the name Windows To Go,\nnow think about that.\n\n34\n00:01:33.446 --> 00:01:36.802\nSo if I can install Windows\n10 on a thumb drive, or\n\n35\n00:01:36.802 --> 00:01:41.820\nwhat I'm going to do in our show here\nis a little portable hard drive.\n\n36\n00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.641\nI can install Windows 10 on\nthat portable hard drive,\n\n37\n00:01:44.641 --> 00:01:47.773\nfull blown copy of the operating system,\neverything I need.\n\n38\n00:01:47.773 --> 00:01:51.870\nI can install applications,\nInternet access, all of that.\n\n39\n00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:55.988\nWhen I go traveling,\ninstead of packing up my laptop and\n\n40\n00:01:55.988 --> 00:01:59.679\nmy charger, my power block and\nall of that stuff.\n\n41\n00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:01.951\nMy mouse, and\neverything I need for that laptop,\n\n42\n00:02:01.951 --> 00:02:06.510\nif I know there's hardware available where\nI'm going, I can simply take this with me.\n\n43\n00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:09.784\nPlug it into any machine that is\ncapable of running Windows 10.\n\n44\n00:02:09.784 --> 00:02:12.154\nAnd we know the hardware requirements for\n\n45\n00:02:12.154 --> 00:02:15.140\nWindows 10 are really\nnot very steep at all.\n\n46\n00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.136\nAnd I can have my machine,\nall of my documents, all of my stuff,\n\n47\n00:02:18.136 --> 00:02:19.145\nright there with me.\n\n48\n00:02:19.145 --> 00:02:23.216\nAnd I'm ready to go,\nI unplug it, every hotel has a-\n\n49\n00:02:23.216 --> 00:02:24.322\n&gt;&gt; Kiosk or something.\n\n50\n00:02:24.322 --> 00:02:26.722\n&gt;&gt; Kiosk, yeah, or a business center-\n&gt;&gt; A shared whatever.\n\n51\n00:02:26.722 --> 00:02:28.550\n&gt;&gt; Where I can go down there, absolutely.\n\n52\n00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:33.402\n&gt;&gt; I know, at first,\nwhen I was thinking about different ways\n\n53\n00:02:33.402 --> 00:02:38.268\nto use this feature,\nI had to jump into some super spy mode.\n\n54\n00:02:38.268 --> 00:02:39.952\nBecause I'm like, yeah,\nyou could just take this anywhere.\n\n55\n00:02:39.952 --> 00:02:43.619\nPlug it into someone's computer and boot\noff of it, and have your own system, but\n\n56\n00:02:43.619 --> 00:02:44.961\nreally, you could, [LAUGH].\n\n57\n00:02:44.961 --> 00:02:49.258\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely, if your job is to\ngo to some organization and do audits or\n\n58\n00:02:49.258 --> 00:02:51.940\ntesting of some kind, things like that.\n\n59\n00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.185\nI could bring my install of Windows,\nall of my tools are on there,\n\n60\n00:02:55.185 --> 00:02:58.020\nI know they've got a PC that I can use,\nI can boot up to it.\n\n61\n00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:02.117\nAnd we'll talk about some security\nfeatures that are built into Windows To Go\n\n62\n00:03:02.117 --> 00:03:03.260\nto help keep us safe.\n\n63\n00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.690\nAlso keep the systems that we're plugging\ninto safe, and things like that as we go.\n\n64\n00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:12.300\nSo that's the general concept is,\ninstalling Windows on removable media.\n\n65\n00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:16.167\nAnd being able to take it on the go,\nhence the name Windows To Go.\n\n66\n00:03:16.167 --> 00:03:19.533\nSo let's start by talking about\nsome of the capabilities,\n\n67\n00:03:19.533 --> 00:03:22.561\nsome of the capabilities,\nsome of the features, and\n\n68\n00:03:22.561 --> 00:03:25.257\nsome of the-\n&gt;&gt; Limitations?\n\n69\n00:03:25.257 --> 00:03:29.267\n&gt;&gt; Limitations, yeah, that would be\na good way to put it, limitations of, and\n\n70\n00:03:29.267 --> 00:03:32.371\nI think we'll just jump out\nto Microsoft's website here.\n\n71\n00:03:32.371 --> 00:03:35.209\nBecause they've got a nice\nlittle summary here for us, and\n\n72\n00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:38.355\nI'll put the link in the show notes,\nbut let's talk about this.\n\n73\n00:03:38.355 --> 00:03:40.712\nThis is just out to TechNet,\nor docs.microsoft.com.\n\n74\n00:03:40.712 --> 00:03:44.248\nAnd what I want to show you is some of\nthe differences between Windows To Go and\n\n75\n00:03:44.248 --> 00:03:45.700\na typical install of Windows.\n\n76\n00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.869\nBecause there are some\nthings that might or\n\n77\n00:03:47.869 --> 00:03:51.380\nmight not make Windows To Go\nthe perfect solution for you.\n\n78\n00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:54.218\nFirst of all, internal disks are offline.\n\n79\n00:03:54.218 --> 00:03:58.630\nSo when I plug in this\nWindows To Go drive into a machine.\n\n80\n00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:01.568\nAnd I boot up to that\nWindows To Go installation,\n\n81\n00:04:01.568 --> 00:04:04.156\nI will not have access\nto the local drives.\n\n82\n00:04:04.156 --> 00:04:08.610\nSo that means whomever's computer I'm\nusing, if I'm at some other organization.\n\n83\n00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:12.918\nThey don't have to worry about me getting\ninto things that are on that machine.\n\n84\n00:04:12.918 --> 00:04:14.648\nI could use Cherokee's laptop and\n\n85\n00:04:14.648 --> 00:04:17.760\nI couldn't access Cherokee's\ninformation on that laptop.\n\n86\n00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.745\nBecause the internal drives\nwon't be brought online,\n\n87\n00:04:20.745 --> 00:04:24.375\nthere's no map that drives to them\nwhen you boot up to Windows To Go.\n\n88\n00:04:24.375 --> 00:04:29.100\nAnd the same thing, if the Windows To Go\ndrive is inserted into a running system.\n\n89\n00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:34.295\nThe Windows To Go drive will not be\nlisted in that local install of Windows.\n\n90\n00:04:34.295 --> 00:04:39.263\nSo they wouldn't be able to browse through\nand look at your Windows To Go drive, so\n\n91\n00:04:39.263 --> 00:04:40.200\nthat's good.\n\n92\n00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.304\nTPM is not going to be used, all right?\n\n93\n00:04:42.304 --> 00:04:44.701\nAnd that's because this is mobile,\nremember,\n\n94\n00:04:44.701 --> 00:04:46.600\na TPM, the trusted platform module.\n\n95\n00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:51.088\nThis is where we can store the key\ninformation for things like BitLocker.\n\n96\n00:04:51.088 --> 00:04:55.188\nBut if I'm taking this drive from\none machine to another to another,\n\n97\n00:04:55.188 --> 00:04:57.670\nI'm not taking the TPM chip with me.\n\n98\n00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:59.950\nSo if I stored any keying\ninformation in there,\n\n99\n00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:02.975\nit wouldn't do me any good if I\nwas at some other organization.\n\n100\n00:05:02.975 --> 00:05:05.310\nAnd I tried to plug in my Windows To Go.\n\n101\n00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:08.329\nObviously, the TPM chip\nwouldn't be there and\n\n102\n00:05:08.329 --> 00:05:13.321\nI wouldn't have that key information,\nso we can't use BitLocker using TPM.\n\n103\n00:05:13.321 --> 00:05:14.505\n&gt;&gt; In a physical sense.\n\n104\n00:05:14.505 --> 00:05:17.259\n&gt;&gt; Yes, we can use BitLocker\nwith a password, right?\n\n105\n00:05:17.259 --> 00:05:20.850\nSo we can still use BitLocker\nto encrypt the drive,\n\n106\n00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:24.952\nwe just can't use the,\nTPM is a place to store those keys.\n\n107\n00:05:24.952 --> 00:05:28.300\n&gt;&gt; And I saw someone,\nthey had set up a flash drive with this.\n\n108\n00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.354\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; And the actual manufacturer, and\n\n109\n00:05:30.354 --> 00:05:34.950\nI'm sure you'll tell us about this, but\nthey had epoxy all on top of the chipsets.\n\n110\n00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:36.950\nSo that the actual chips\ncould not be modified,\n\n111\n00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:38.888\nI just thought that that was really cool.\n\n112\n00:05:38.888 --> 00:05:39.616\n&gt;&gt; Really?\n\n113\n00:05:39.616 --> 00:05:41.730\nInteresting, nice, as long as it doesn't\noverheat, I guess, you're good to go.\n\n114\n00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:45.282\n&gt;&gt; I was thinking about that too, but\nI don't know, it was over $700 so\n\n115\n00:05:45.282 --> 00:05:47.355\nI didn't buy it to test it, Mike.\n\n116\n00:05:47.355 --> 00:05:47.915\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n117\n00:05:47.915 --> 00:05:48.628\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n118\n00:05:48.628 --> 00:05:52.260\nthey must have done their testing if\nthey're charging $700 for it, hopefully.\n\n119\n00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:56.464\nAll right, so TPM's not going to be used,\nHibernate is disabled by default, again,\n\n120\n00:05:56.464 --> 00:05:57.973\nsame kind of concept, right?\n\n121\n00:05:57.973 --> 00:06:02.073\nWhen we go into hibernation, we write\neverything that's in memory to that\n\n122\n00:06:02.073 --> 00:06:05.830\nhiberfil.sys, and\nthat's stored in the local hard drive.\n\n123\n00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:08.991\nAnd if I go and take that to another\nmachine and try to wake it up,\n\n124\n00:06:08.991 --> 00:06:11.088\ndifferent hardware, things like that.\n\n125\n00:06:11.088 --> 00:06:16.080\nIt's going to cause major problems,\nso hibernate is going to be disabled,\n\n126\n00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:17.670\nit can be re-enabled.\n\n127\n00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:22.308\nLike I said, it can cause some issues\nthough, the hyper file will be written to\n\n128\n00:06:22.308 --> 00:06:25.490\nthe local drive, I mean,\nto the Windows To Go drive.\n\n129\n00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:29.396\nSo it's not like it stays like the TPM,\nbut again, different machines,\n\n130\n00:06:29.396 --> 00:06:33.940\ndifferent configurations, it can\ndefinitely cause some problems there.\n\n131\n00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:37.246\nWindows Recovery Environment is\nnot going to be available either,\n\n132\n00:06:37.246 --> 00:06:39.743\ndo you have a problem with\nyour Windows To Go drive?\n\n133\n00:06:39.743 --> 00:06:43.727\nYou should just reinstall Windows on it,\nthat's Microsoft's recommendation.\n\n134\n00:06:43.727 --> 00:06:49.479\nYou're not trying to save it and\nrepair it, you're just going to reinstall.\n\n135\n00:06:49.479 --> 00:06:52.593\n&gt;&gt; So\nI could see this particular use case,\n\n136\n00:06:52.593 --> 00:06:56.620\nsomething like if I have\nan Internet connection.\n\n137\n00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:59.783\nIf I have a lot of files that I need to\nsave and retain, it might be better just\n\n138\n00:06:59.783 --> 00:07:02.559\nto go ahead and store them up\nto the Cloud, what do you think?\n\n139\n00:07:02.559 --> 00:07:03.398\n&gt;&gt; Absoutely, yeah.\n\n140\n00:07:03.398 --> 00:07:07.399\nIf you're worried about that, if you are\nfeeling like, if something goes wrong with\n\n141\n00:07:07.399 --> 00:07:10.990\nthis, then I have to reinstall or\nlose a lot of information.\n\n142\n00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:13.750\nDefinitely use your One Drive,\nfor example.\n\n143\n00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:17.476\nStore that information there, and\nnow you have no problem blowing away and\n\n144\n00:07:17.476 --> 00:07:20.230\nreinstalling Windows, absolutely.\n\n145\n00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:23.772\nRefreshing or resetting the Windows To Go\nworkspace is not supported.\n\n146\n00:07:23.772 --> 00:07:27.636\nAgain, just go ahead and\nreimage the device, it's much easier,\n\n147\n00:07:27.636 --> 00:07:31.170\nupgrading a Windows To Go\nworkspace is not supported.\n\n148\n00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:34.138\nSo if you built this on Windows 8 or\nWindows 8.1,\n\n149\n00:07:34.138 --> 00:07:37.382\nyou can't upgrade to\nWindows To Go before Windows 10.\n\n150\n00:07:37.382 --> 00:07:39.953\nYou would just need to rebuild the drives,\nso\n\n151\n00:07:39.953 --> 00:07:43.900\nthere are some differences with\nthe versions are there, all right?\n\n152\n00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:46.894\nAgain, a lot of good reading here\nif you want to go through and\n\n153\n00:07:46.894 --> 00:07:48.970\nread this out on docs.microsoft.com.\n\n154\n00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:53.560\nBut I do want to show you one\nother important section down here\n\n155\n00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:55.273\nabout the USB drives.\n\n156\n00:07:55.273 --> 00:08:00.222\nBecause we are talking about running an\noperating system from an external drive.\n\n157\n00:08:00.222 --> 00:08:05.470\nSo we need to make sure that those drives\nhave the appropriate level of performance.\n\n158\n00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:07.620\nReally, it's all about random reads and\n\n159\n00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:11.254\nwrites that occur when you're\nrunning an operating system, right?\n\n160\n00:08:11.254 --> 00:08:14.488\nThere's all kinds of things going\non in the background, system calls,\n\n161\n00:08:14.488 --> 00:08:17.881\nhardware talking to the operating system\nand calling back to the hardware,\n\n162\n00:08:17.881 --> 00:08:20.425\nthings like that, above and\nbeyond what you're doing,\n\n163\n00:08:20.425 --> 00:08:22.410\nopening up a Word document or\nwhat have you.\n\n164\n00:08:22.410 --> 00:08:25.044\nThere's a lot of reads and\nwrites going on.\n\n165\n00:08:25.044 --> 00:08:27.396\nAnd if you don't have\nthe proper throughput,\n\n166\n00:08:27.396 --> 00:08:29.577\nit's gonna cause a performance problem.\n\n167\n00:08:29.577 --> 00:08:33.241\nAnd Microsoft doesn't want you\ntrying out Windows to Go and going,\n\n168\n00:08:33.241 --> 00:08:34.600\n[SOUND] this is horrible.\n\n169\n00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:35.266\n&gt;&gt; Lame [LAUGH].\n\n170\n00:08:35.266 --> 00:08:38.928\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so we wanna make sure we're\nusing hardware that is supported and\n\n171\n00:08:38.928 --> 00:08:42.910\nrecommended for Microsoft, so we that\nwe can get that level of performance.\n\n172\n00:08:42.910 --> 00:08:47.560\nYou can see here Windows To Go certified\ndrives high random read/writes,\n\n173\n00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:50.900\nsupport thousands of random\nI/O operations per second.\n\n174\n00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:54.360\nThat is normally occurring\nwhen you're running Windows.\n\n175\n00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:56.480\nAnd they've also been tuned\nto ensure they boot and\n\n176\n00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:59.660\nrun on hardware with Windows 7 and later.\n\n177\n00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:01.520\nAnd they're supposedly built to last.\n\n178\n00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:05.329\nYou were talking about the $700\none with epoxy in there.\n\n179\n00:09:05.329 --> 00:09:07.058\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; These devices are supposed to\n\n180\n00:09:07.058 --> 00:09:08.625\nbe a little better quality.\n\n181\n00:09:08.625 --> 00:09:12.789\n&gt;&gt; With steel enclosures,\nnot like the plastic ones that most,\n\n182\n00:09:12.789 --> 00:09:15.895\nat least most of my\nexternal USB sticks have.\n\n183\n00:09:15.895 --> 00:09:19.525\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, this is not the five for\n$10 pack of USB\n\n184\n00:09:19.525 --> 00:09:23.535\ndrives that you're gonna get off of\nthe end cap at the local box store.\n\n185\n00:09:23.535 --> 00:09:27.875\nYou're gonna go out and\nget a good quality set, or\n\n186\n00:09:27.875 --> 00:09:31.070\na good quality USB drive or thumb drive.\n\n187\n00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:33.615\nThey've got a list here of\ndrives that have been certified-\n\n188\n00:09:33.615 --> 00:09:34.865\n&gt;&gt; I think it was that one actually Mike,\n\n189\n00:09:34.865 --> 00:09:35.968\nif you click on that link, yeah.\n\n190\n00:09:35.968 --> 00:09:37.080\n&gt;&gt; IronKey Workspace?\n\n191\n00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:38.370\nLet's take a look and just see.\n\n192\n00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:42.860\nSo there is IronKey.\n\n193\n00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:45.540\n&gt;&gt; And they have little videos if you\nguys are interested, it's kinda cool.\n\n194\n00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:46.850\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n195\n00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:51.000\n&gt;&gt; So, and I wouldn't recommend any one\nover the other, but there's a list here.\n\n196\n00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:51.730\nThere's not that many.\n\n197\n00:09:51.730 --> 00:09:53.920\nYou can see IronKey makes three of them.\n\n198\n00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:58.200\nKingston makes their DataTraveler,\nSpyrus Portable Workspace,\n\n199\n00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:00.969\nPortable Workspace, and\nthey have a few up there.\n\n200\n00:10:00.969 --> 00:10:04.600\nSuper Talent Express,\nsome of these I've never even heard of.\n\n201\n00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:07.250\nBut I'm sure they're fantastic drives.\n\n202\n00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:10.150\nThe one I have is my\nWestern Digital Passport.\n\n203\n00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:14.130\nBecause at the time when this first\ncame out, those thumb drives are one,\n\n204\n00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:15.500\nvery expensive.\n\n205\n00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:17.790\n&gt;&gt; Because you're compact, right?\n\n206\n00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:19.335\nWhereas I've got a mechanical spinning,\n\n207\n00:10:19.335 --> 00:10:23.340\nit's a lot cheaper but\nstill has the performance that I need.\n\n208\n00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:25.180\nSo that's the one I went with.\n\n209\n00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:30.450\nOther than that, your host computer\ndoes have to support Windows.\n\n210\n00:10:30.450 --> 00:10:34.760\nBut anything that'll run Windows 7 or\nlater, is gonna run Windows To Go.\n\n211\n00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:38.040\nSo you're pretty wide open there,\nall right?\n\n212\n00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:42.265\nSo that's the idea behind Windows To Go,\nsome of the caveats and\n\n213\n00:10:42.265 --> 00:10:47.193\nsome of the good things about it, as well\nas some of the devices we can use and\n\n214\n00:10:47.193 --> 00:10:50.652\nwhere you can get more\ninformation on Windows To Go.\n\n215\n00:10:50.652 --> 00:10:53.940\nAll right, now let's say we've decided,\nI wanna do this, I want Windows To Go.\n\n216\n00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:56.060\nI'm a travelling salesperson, or\n\n217\n00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:59.980\nI visit branch offices all\nthe time to work on their systems.\n\n218\n00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:04.110\nI wanna bring my computer, but\nI sure do hate lugging my laptop around.\n\n219\n00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:04.910\nNow Cherokee,\n\n220\n00:11:04.910 --> 00:11:07.533\nyou and I have these nice, light Dell-\n&gt;&gt; Mamba-jambas over\n\n221\n00:11:07.533 --> 00:11:08.040\nhere, they're huge [LAUGH].\n\n222\n00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:12.800\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, these Precisions are not light,\nI mean they're pretty heavy.\n\n223\n00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:14.246\nAnd carrying those around,\nit can be a pain.\n\n224\n00:11:14.246 --> 00:11:18.934\n&gt;&gt; Well, travelling, that is a huge issue\nthat I've experienced, especially if it's\n\n225\n00:11:18.934 --> 00:11:22.762\na short flight and you don't want to\ncheck any bags or anything [LAUGH].\n\n226\n00:11:22.762 --> 00:11:24.372\n&gt;&gt; You've got the thumb drive in\nthe pocket, and you're good to go, right?\n\n227\n00:11:24.372 --> 00:11:25.236\n&gt;&gt; Good to go.\n\n228\n00:11:25.236 --> 00:11:28.750\nAll right, so\nhow do we get this all set up?\n\n229\n00:11:28.750 --> 00:11:30.830\nWell, first of all we're gonna\nneed a couple of things.\n\n230\n00:11:30.830 --> 00:11:33.230\nWe're gonna need Windows 10 Enterprise or\n\n231\n00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:37.260\nWindows 10 Professional to build\nthat Windows To Go installation.\n\n232\n00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:39.450\nSo I'm talking about what's\ninstalled locally on your PC,\n\n233\n00:11:39.450 --> 00:11:42.360\nnot what we're gonna\ninstall on Windows To Go.\n\n234\n00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:46.495\nSo it has to be Enterprise or\nPro, you can't do this with Home.\n\n235\n00:11:46.495 --> 00:11:48.660\nYou'll also need installation media,\n\n236\n00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:50.980\nbecause I am going to\nbe installing Windows.\n\n237\n00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:56.790\nSo find your ISO, break it out,\nget that install.wim out of there.\n\n238\n00:11:56.790 --> 00:11:59.890\nAnd we're gonna need to point it to that,\nto get this all set up.\n\n239\n00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:03.140\nAll right, then we're gonna need a drive,\nand I'm gonna start.\n\n240\n00:12:03.140 --> 00:12:06.230\nI've got one that's built already,\nthat we're gonna demonstrate.\n\n241\n00:12:06.230 --> 00:12:09.100\nBut I've got also a different drive\nthat shouldn't have anything on it.\n\n242\n00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:12.740\nCherokee said I could blow it away,\nthere's nothing important on there.\n\n243\n00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:15.870\nSo we're gonna plug\nthis external drive in.\n\n244\n00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:21.640\nAnd once I let the system\nrecognize that drive, there we go.\n\n245\n00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:24.014\nMake sure it's got any drivers it needs,\nlooks good.\n\n246\n00:12:24.014 --> 00:12:29.910\nI'm simply gonna go over here to my Start\nmenu, and I'm gonna type in Windows To Go.\n\n247\n00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:32.560\nAnd right here at the top\nis Windows To Go.\n\n248\n00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:34.740\nYou can see it's a control panel applet,\nso\n\n249\n00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:37.310\nI could also go through\nthe control panel to get there.\n\n250\n00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:42.142\nAnd this is the Windows To Go workspace,\nor what they call the workspace wizard,\n\n251\n00:12:42.142 --> 00:12:44.859\nwhere I can create\na Windows To Go workspace.\n\n252\n00:12:44.859 --> 00:12:46.393\nAnd that's what they call it,\n\n253\n00:12:46.393 --> 00:12:49.700\nis my Windows To Go workspace is\nwhat I have on that external drive.\n\n254\n00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:52.520\nYou can see that it recognized my drive.\n\n255\n00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:54.670\nAll right, I can see it sitting here.\n\n256\n00:12:54.670 --> 00:12:57.680\nIt also says Windows performance might\nbe impacted if you use this drive.\n\n257\n00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:01.750\nFor best results, use a Windows To Go\ncertified USB 3.0 drive.\n\n258\n00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:04.500\nSo this drive that I'm using\nright now is not certified.\n\n259\n00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:07.330\nIt's not on that list of approved devices.\n\n260\n00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:09.480\nNotice it's gonna let me do it anyway.\n\n261\n00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:10.560\nBut it's telling me, hey,\n\n262\n00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:15.320\nthis might not be all that pleasurable\nonce you boot up and try to use it.\n\n263\n00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:20.010\nSo fair warning, you didn't want to\nheed or pay attention to our list, so\n\n264\n00:13:20.010 --> 00:13:21.100\nyou're on your own.\n\n265\n00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:22.110\nPlus, it's not supported.\n\n266\n00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:25.840\nIf you install Windows To Go on any\nother device that's not on their list,\n\n267\n00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:28.095\nthere's no support from Microsoft\nif you're an enterprise and\n\n268\n00:13:28.095 --> 00:13:29.120\nyou need that kind of support.\n\n269\n00:13:30.230 --> 00:13:34.534\nSo I'll simply click Next, and\nit's going to look for an image.\n\n270\n00:13:34.534 --> 00:13:37.600\nThat it doesn't come up with anything.\n\n271\n00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:42.630\nI'm not exactly sure where it looks by\ndefault, maybe My Documents, I'm not sure.\n\n272\n00:13:42.630 --> 00:13:44.678\nBut if you just click Add search location.\n\n273\n00:13:44.678 --> 00:13:51.110\nAnd I'm gonna go find that WIM file,\nwhich should be right here.\n\n274\n00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:52.250\nSo let's select that folder.\n\n275\n00:13:52.250 --> 00:13:54.082\nAnd there we go, that is odd.\n\n276\n00:13:54.082 --> 00:13:57.550\nLet me just do that again, just to\nshow you guys that it wasn't magic.\n\n277\n00:13:57.550 --> 00:14:00.480\nIt didn't show the WIM file in that list.\n\n278\n00:14:01.595 --> 00:14:06.915\nThe wizard is saying pick a folder, so it\nwasn't showing my the files inside there.\n\n279\n00:14:06.915 --> 00:14:11.525\nBut inside that mapped folder,\nyou can see I have install.wim.\n\n280\n00:14:11.525 --> 00:14:16.695\nSo that's why I picked that folder,\nand it then populated my wizard.\n\n281\n00:14:16.695 --> 00:14:21.971\nSo now it says, you're gonna use that\nWindows 10 Enterprise Eval WIM, right?\n\n282\n00:14:21.971 --> 00:14:24.730\nSo I can see that it's found it,\nit's okay with it.\n\n283\n00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:25.680\nI'll click Next.\n\n284\n00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:30.990\nAnd then here I got to choose whether or\nnot I want to use BitLocker, all right?\n\n285\n00:14:30.990 --> 00:14:34.585\nSo I'm gonna choose Use BitLocker\nwith my Windows To Go workspace.\n\n286\n00:14:34.585 --> 00:14:38.635\nThat means when I boot up this Windows To\nGo, I will need to know this password.\n\n287\n00:14:38.635 --> 00:14:41.595\nSo if somebody finds my drive,\nplugs it in,\n\n288\n00:14:41.595 --> 00:14:44.175\nreboots their system,\nthey're gonna need the password.\n\n289\n00:14:44.175 --> 00:14:46.125\nIt's gonna slow them\ndown a little bit anyway.\n\n290\n00:14:47.195 --> 00:14:51.455\nSo we'll type in my super secret\npassword a couple of times,\n\n291\n00:14:51.455 --> 00:14:54.990\nand then I'll click Next.\n\n292\n00:14:54.990 --> 00:14:58.450\nI'm gonna zoom back out here so\nI can re-center this.\n\n293\n00:14:58.450 --> 00:15:00.080\nAnd then we'll take a look.\n\n294\n00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:02.780\nAnd it tells me,\nUSB drive will be reformatted and\n\n295\n00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:04.590\nany data on it will be deleted.\n\n296\n00:15:04.590 --> 00:15:08.430\nBefore you continue, back up any\ndata that you do not want to lose.\n\n297\n00:15:08.430 --> 00:15:09.870\nWe know that, right?\n\n298\n00:15:09.870 --> 00:15:12.360\nWe know what happens\nwhen we format drives.\n\n299\n00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:15.630\nSo this drive is blank, or she ensured\nme there's nothing on there, so\n\n300\n00:15:15.630 --> 00:15:16.890\nI'm not worried about it.\n\n301\n00:15:16.890 --> 00:15:20.480\nYou, if you have a drive that you're\ntesting this out with, make sure you copy\n\n302\n00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:24.390\neverything off of that drive if it's\nimportant, because it will be lost.\n\n303\n00:15:24.390 --> 00:15:26.210\nNow I'm not gonna continue the process.\n\n304\n00:15:26.210 --> 00:15:29.220\nBecause once I click Create,\nit will begin.\n\n305\n00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:32.140\nAnd the last one I built on USB 3.0,\n\n306\n00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:36.940\nusing a relatively new system,\ntook almost an hour to build that.\n\n307\n00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:39.330\nSo it's a little on\nthe slow side of things.\n\n308\n00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:42.430\nI've actually imaged VMs faster than this.\n\n309\n00:15:42.430 --> 00:15:46.000\nSo I don't know what the hold up was,\nbut I'm a patient guy.\n\n310\n00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.960\nAnd it's a pretty cool outcome,\nso it's worth the wait, right?\n\n311\n00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:51.400\nBut you click Create,\nit starts the process.\n\n312\n00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:53.080\nYou just let it go.\n\n313\n00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:57.527\nEventually, it'll tell you that it's\nfinished and you're good to go.\n\n314\n00:15:57.527 --> 00:16:02.706\nNow once you created that Windows To Go\ndrive, There is one other thing you're\n\n315\n00:16:02.706 --> 00:16:07.884\ngonna wanna do and that is to test it and\nyou wanna change your start up options,\n\n316\n00:16:07.884 --> 00:16:11.930\nbecause we're gonna be\nbooting again to that USB.\n\n317\n00:16:11.930 --> 00:16:17.160\nBack over to my Start menu and I'm simply\ngonna type in Windows To Go again, and\n\n318\n00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:22.160\none of the options you're gonna see is\nChange Windows To Go startup option.\n\n319\n00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:25.690\nIf I was to keep typing out\nWindows To Go startup options,\n\n320\n00:16:25.690 --> 00:16:27.710\nwe could get that to the top of the list.\n\n321\n00:16:27.710 --> 00:16:32.600\nBut I'm gonna select that,\nChange Windows To Go startup options and\n\n322\n00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:36.660\nthen you can see my choices\nhere are going to be yes\n\n323\n00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:41.620\nto allow automatically booting to\na Windows To Go workspace or no.\n\n324\n00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:46.410\nIf you choose no, then it doesn't\nmean you can't use Windows To Go.\n\n325\n00:16:46.410 --> 00:16:49.480\nBut it's not gonna boot into it\nautomatically, you'll have to do your F10\n\n326\n00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:54.630\nor F12 or F2 or Escape or whatever it is\nto get into your onetime boot menu and\n\n327\n00:16:54.630 --> 00:16:56.140\nyou have to pick the boot to the USB.\n\n328\n00:16:56.140 --> 00:17:00.010\nYou might have to rearrange some\nthings in your BIOS to make sure\n\n329\n00:17:00.010 --> 00:17:03.130\nthat USB comes up in the proper\nplace to be able to boot to it.\n\n330\n00:17:03.130 --> 00:17:06.220\nIf I choose yes,\nI don't have to mess with any of that.\n\n331\n00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:08.400\nI can simply reboot the system.\n\n332\n00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:10.870\nAnd if it detects\na Windows To Go installation,\n\n333\n00:17:10.870 --> 00:17:12.720\nit'll automatically boot to that.\n\n334\n00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:19.260\nSo I'm gonna say, yes on here and\nI'll zoom back out and click save changes.\n\n335\n00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:23.520\nSo now we've set up the machine,\n\n336\n00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:25.850\nwe've built our Windows To Go and\nwe've enabled this.\n\n337\n00:17:25.850 --> 00:17:30.400\nNow if I was taking this with me and\nI was going with somebody else's machine,\n\n338\n00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:33.000\nI would probably just use\nthe onetime boot menu\n\n339\n00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:34.900\nto get into my Windows To Go installation.\n\n340\n00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:37.620\nI don't wanna mess with their computer and\ntheir boot order or\n\n341\n00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:42.280\ntheir startup options or anything like\nthat, the idea is I wanna be unobtrusive.\n\n342\n00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:45.553\nI don't want to mess with their systems or\n\n343\n00:17:45.553 --> 00:17:49.490\nas little as possible,\nso that is the idea.\n\n344\n00:17:49.490 --> 00:17:50.860\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n345\n00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:56.100\neject that drive we just put in there\nsince we're not gonna be using that.\n\n346\n00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:57.610\nAnd now, I'm gonna shut down my system.\n\n347\n00:17:57.610 --> 00:18:00.870\nSo you can kill the screen feed there and\n\n348\n00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:04.360\nI'm gonna shut this guy down,\nI'm gonna plug in the drive.\n\n349\n00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:09.190\nAnd I won't be able to show you\nthe actual boot process, because I\n\n350\n00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:14.680\ndon't have any video going out to my\ndisplay port during the boot process.\n\n351\n00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:18.008\nBut I'm simply plugging in the USB drive,\n\n352\n00:18:18.008 --> 00:18:23.660\nnow that the machine is shut down and\nI'm going to fire my laptop backup.\n\n353\n00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:25.450\nAnd we'll wait for this to boot and\n\n354\n00:18:25.450 --> 00:18:29.620\nwe should see that it's no longer\ngonna be my nice ITPro.TV background.\n\n355\n00:18:29.620 --> 00:18:30.450\nFor my laptop,\n\n356\n00:18:30.450 --> 00:18:34.710\nit should be my brand new installation\nof Windows on my Windows To Go drive.\n\n357\n00:18:34.710 --> 00:18:37.270\nSo we'll see and\nas you guys aren't seeing any of this,\n\n358\n00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:39.920\nit looks like it's just\na black screen up there.\n\n359\n00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:42.130\nI'll let you know as soon as it pops up.\n\n360\n00:18:42.130 --> 00:18:46.700\nBut because I said yes, I shouldn't have\nto do anything,.hands off the keyboard.\n\n361\n00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:49.396\nNow unfortunately,\nyou can't see my screen right now.\n\n362\n00:18:49.396 --> 00:18:51.487\nBut what I'm looking at it says,\n\n363\n00:18:51.487 --> 00:18:56.900\nBitLocker because remember the option\nto allow BitLocker or to use BitLocker.\n\n364\n00:18:56.900 --> 00:18:59.820\nSo I'm getting a dialog box that says,\n\n365\n00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:02.580\nhey, enter the password\nto unlock this drive.\n\n366\n00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:05.040\nIf I didn't know what that password was,\n\n367\n00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:06.880\nI would not be able to\nboot up to this drive.\n\n368\n00:19:09.410 --> 00:19:14.840\nSo I'll go ahead and type in my password,\nand we'll let this boot up.\n\n369\n00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:17.237\nAnd as soon as my video starts displaying,\n\n370\n00:19:17.237 --> 00:19:21.450\nI'll key out there to Titus to let\nhim know to share my screen again.\n\n371\n00:19:21.450 --> 00:19:23.190\nRight now, it looks like a normal boot.\n\n372\n00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:24.970\nI've got my Dell emblem up.\n\n373\n00:19:24.970 --> 00:19:28.580\nI see my little spinning\ndots going around.\n\n374\n00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:31.563\n&gt;&gt; Spinning wheel thing.\n&gt;&gt; They are going through the boot process\n\n375\n00:19:31.563 --> 00:19:35.569\nhere, but I can also see the activity\nlight on my portable hard\n\n376\n00:19:35.569 --> 00:19:37.660\ndrive is blinking away as well.\n\n377\n00:19:37.660 --> 00:19:41.230\nSo it's a good indicator that it is\nbooting over to that Windows To Go.\n\n378\n00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:48.400\nJust about ready, what else do I want\nto tell you about while this is going.\n\n379\n00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:53.270\nI can't think of anything else\nlike I said, I like Windows To Go.\n\n380\n00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:57.343\nIt still does Windows updates, so\nlet me make sure we were clear on,\n\n381\n00:19:57.343 --> 00:20:02.274\nyou can't upgrade from Windows 8.1 to\nWindows 10 Windows To Go workspaces,\n\n382\n00:20:02.274 --> 00:20:04.790\nbut this is a Windows 10 installation.\n\n383\n00:20:04.790 --> 00:20:08.430\nIt'll do updates just like\nany other Windows 10 install,\n\n384\n00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:10.010\nwhich is something to keep in mind.\n\n385\n00:20:10.010 --> 00:20:12.380\nFirst time you set it up,\nlet it get its updates.\n\n386\n00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:15.380\nOtherwise, you're gonna get to your\ndestination, plug that drive in,\n\n387\n00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:16.980\nstart to use it, and\n\n388\n00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:19.869\nit's gonna go really slow because it's\ndoing all its updates in the background.\n\n389\n00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:22.270\nIt's just about ready.\n\n390\n00:20:22.270 --> 00:20:26.580\nI've got a mouse and\nI've got a blue spinning cheerio and\n\n391\n00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:28.776\nyou might be able to see my screen now,\nTitus.\n\n392\n00:20:28.776 --> 00:20:33.474\nYep, there we go, so Titus works his\nmagic and throws my screen up there, and\n\n393\n00:20:33.474 --> 00:20:35.590\nyou can see a normal Windows boot.\n\n394\n00:20:35.590 --> 00:20:36.958\nIt's not different,\n\n395\n00:20:36.958 --> 00:20:41.350\nthere's no difference from any other\ninstall of Windows at this point.\n\n396\n00:20:42.370 --> 00:20:44.642\n&gt;&gt; I mean, it isn't a hard drive and\n\n397\n00:20:44.642 --> 00:20:48.750\nyou have one inside of your\ncomputer versus externally so.\n\n398\n00:20:48.750 --> 00:20:52.580\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, I mean,\nit is the same thing.\n\n399\n00:20:52.580 --> 00:20:54.585\nSo lets see if I've got mouse action,\nthere we go.\n\n400\n00:20:54.585 --> 00:20:57.950\nWhich actually, that's something I could\nhave been talking about while we were\n\n401\n00:20:57.950 --> 00:21:00.550\nwaiting for\nthis is what about the hardware?\n\n402\n00:21:00.550 --> 00:21:03.960\nCuz as you said, it's just a hard\ndrive with Windows installed on it.\n\n403\n00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:06.890\nBut the difference is what about\nmy hardware extraction layer?\n\n404\n00:21:06.890 --> 00:21:11.470\nWhat about the hardware and what about\nwhen I move to a different machine\n\n405\n00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:15.010\nthat has different hardware, different\nnetwork adapters, different motherboards,\n\n406\n00:21:15.010 --> 00:21:18.450\ndifferent processor, different\namounts of memory, different drivers?\n\n407\n00:21:18.450 --> 00:21:19.360\nAll of that stuff.\n\n408\n00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:21.070\nHow is this even possible?\n\n409\n00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:25.292\nAnd what it's doing is it's\nactually running, gosh,\n\n410\n00:21:25.292 --> 00:21:28.060\nwhat the heck are they called?\n\n411\n00:21:28.060 --> 00:21:30.540\nWhen it first does the hardware\ndetection on a Windows install,\n\n412\n00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:31.760\ndo you remember that?\n\n413\n00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:33.340\n&gt;&gt; Hardware profile settings?\n\n414\n00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:35.710\n&gt;&gt; Maybe,\nI can't remember the term for that.\n\n415\n00:21:35.710 --> 00:21:38.610\nBut when you install Windows,\nit does hardware detection.\n\n416\n00:21:38.610 --> 00:21:42.370\nIt gets a list of the hardware,\nmake sure its got the appropriate drivers.\n\n417\n00:21:42.370 --> 00:21:45.370\nWhat Windows To Go will\ndo is it'll do that for\n\n418\n00:21:45.370 --> 00:21:47.750\nevery system that you plug this into.\n\n419\n00:21:47.750 --> 00:21:52.350\nIt'll detect the hardware, load up\nthe appropriate drivers that Windows has.\n\n420\n00:21:52.350 --> 00:21:55.060\nWe're not talking custom drivers\nlike custom video card drivers,\n\n421\n00:21:55.060 --> 00:21:55.940\nanything like that.\n\n422\n00:21:55.940 --> 00:21:59.480\nJust Windows generic drivers\nwhich Windows has a plethora of,\n\n423\n00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:03.180\nthere's plenty of them should be able\nto run just about any device just fine.\n\n424\n00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:07.308\nBut if I take it to a different system,\nit's gonna do that detection all over\n\n425\n00:22:07.308 --> 00:22:11.451\nagain and load up different settings or\ndifferent drivers for that system.\n\n426\n00:22:11.451 --> 00:22:14.385\nBut the cool thing is, is it remembers it.\n\n427\n00:22:14.385 --> 00:22:18.685\nSo when I come back to my laptop, it goes,\nI'm back in that dag of a laptop.\n\n428\n00:22:18.685 --> 00:22:20.015\nI don't have to detect the hardware.\n\n429\n00:22:20.015 --> 00:22:21.745\nI already know what was there.\n\n430\n00:22:21.745 --> 00:22:24.975\nIf I go back to the other system I\nplugged it into, it'll remember that.\n\n431\n00:22:24.975 --> 00:22:27.705\nSo it does build up a little\nlist of all the different\n\n432\n00:22:27.705 --> 00:22:30.835\nhardware that it's been plugged into and\nit loads the appropriate driver.\n\n433\n00:22:30.835 --> 00:22:33.840\nSo very, very cool in that respect.\n\n434\n00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:38.050\nSo I'm gonna be logging\nin to the system here and\n\n435\n00:22:38.050 --> 00:22:42.380\nhere I can see my brand new clean install-\n&gt;&gt; No ITPro.TV logo.\n\n436\n00:22:42.380 --> 00:22:45.380\n&gt;&gt; Of Windows 10, no ITPro.TV logo.\n\n437\n00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:49.890\nIf I open up file explorer and\nit's just like any other machine.\n\n438\n00:22:49.890 --> 00:22:51.040\nI just started it up, so\n\n439\n00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:54.090\nit's probably doing a little\ndefender scan in the background.\n\n440\n00:22:54.090 --> 00:22:57.330\nLoading up some of those last drivers and\nthings like that, so\n\n441\n00:22:57.330 --> 00:23:02.430\nperformance in the very beginning might be\na little different and this is kinda cool.\n\n442\n00:23:02.430 --> 00:23:06.702\nSo look, it detected the fact that I'm\nusing a Logitech mouse with this install\n\n443\n00:23:06.702 --> 00:23:09.906\nand saying, hey, well,\nyou need to install the drivers.\n\n444\n00:23:09.906 --> 00:23:16.070\nSo if I was to install this, those drivers\nwould go not to my physical machine.\n\n445\n00:23:16.070 --> 00:23:17.630\nThey're already there,\nthe drivers are already there.\n\n446\n00:23:17.630 --> 00:23:20.590\nBut it would install the drivers\non my Windows To Go install.\n\n447\n00:23:20.590 --> 00:23:24.540\nSo the next time I plug in this laptop,\nit would already have the drivers for\n\n448\n00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:27.260\nmy mouse with all those extra buttons and\nthings like that.\n\n449\n00:23:27.260 --> 00:23:30.090\nSo I wouldn't be using the generic\n\n450\n00:23:30.090 --> 00:23:34.880\nWindows human interface device\ntype driver, so very cool.\n\n451\n00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:38.160\nThe other thing I'll look at here and\nI know this is a little bit small,\n\n452\n00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:40.240\nbut let me zoom in.\n\n453\n00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:45.080\nI don't have ZoomIt installed on this new\ninstall of Windows, so I can't zoom in.\n\n454\n00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:49.730\nBut what you'll see here\nis local disk C and\n\n455\n00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:53.670\nit's 465 gigabytes,\nthat's the size of my portable hard drive.\n\n456\n00:23:53.670 --> 00:23:57.200\nYou should also be able to see that\nlittle lock icon right above it.\n\n457\n00:23:57.200 --> 00:24:00.895\nThat's indicating that BitLocker\nhas been applied to this drive and\n\n458\n00:24:00.895 --> 00:24:03.834\nit is currently unlocked,\nwhich what you don't see.\n\n459\n00:24:03.834 --> 00:24:06.946\nIs the physical drives from my laptop,\nwhich I have two of.\n\n460\n00:24:06.946 --> 00:24:09.670\nI have a solid-state drive and\nI have a physical drive in here.\n\n461\n00:24:09.670 --> 00:24:10.900\nNone of those are showing up.\n\n462\n00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:15.660\nI can't browse and access those local\nfiles on this piece of hardware.\n\n463\n00:24:15.660 --> 00:24:19.665\nCuz again, this might not be my machine,\nI might be at some other organization.\n\n464\n00:24:19.665 --> 00:24:22.490\nOr borrowing somebody's machine\nat one of those kiosks,\n\n465\n00:24:22.490 --> 00:24:25.760\nor a business center at the hotel.\n\n466\n00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:28.780\nAnd there might be stuff on there\nthat I'm not supposed to get to,\n\n467\n00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:31.390\nand I don't want them seeing my stuff.\n\n468\n00:24:31.390 --> 00:24:35.483\nAnother thing I will warn you\nabout is shutting this guy down.\n\n469\n00:24:35.483 --> 00:24:37.440\nYou wanna shut it down properly.\n\n470\n00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:42.475\nYou do not want to yank this USB drive\nout of the PC while it's running.\n\n471\n00:24:42.475 --> 00:24:46.870\nWe can end up corrupting a lot of things\nand ruin our install of Windows To Go.\n\n472\n00:24:46.870 --> 00:24:51.750\nAnd you really shouldn't plug this\ndrive into a running machine.\n\n473\n00:24:51.750 --> 00:24:53.900\nNow, that's Microsoft's recommendation.\n\n474\n00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:57.320\nI will tell you that I've done it,\nand I haven't had any problems.\n\n475\n00:24:57.320 --> 00:25:02.050\nPlug it into a running machine, reboot\nthe machine, hit the F10, or whatever,\n\n476\n00:25:02.050 --> 00:25:06.790\nto go into my one-time boot menu,\nchoose USB, and it booted just fine.\n\n477\n00:25:06.790 --> 00:25:08.640\nI might have gotten lucky, though.\n\n478\n00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:12.545\nSo for the exam, when you're studying for\nthe exam, you wanna follow Microsoft's\n\n479\n00:25:12.545 --> 00:25:15.355\nrecommendations, not\nMike Rodrick's recommendations.\n\n480\n00:25:15.355 --> 00:25:20.021\nAnd so Microsoft says, do not remove\nthe drive from a running system.\n\n481\n00:25:20.021 --> 00:25:23.300\nDo not plug the drive\ninto a running system.\n\n482\n00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:25.880\nAlways shut Windows To Go\ndown before you remove it.\n\n483\n00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:28.840\nAlways shut the PC down\nbefore you insert it.\n\n484\n00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:31.410\nThat way,\nwe don't run any risk of corruption.\n\n485\n00:25:31.410 --> 00:25:34.716\nI don't want Windows plugging it in and\ngoing, look a new external drive.\n\n486\n00:25:34.716 --> 00:25:36.720\nWhat would you like to do with this drive?\n\n487\n00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:41.590\nOr doing any scans on it, or anything like\nthat that Windows like to do automatically\n\n488\n00:25:41.590 --> 00:25:44.610\nwhen we plug in those USB drives.\n\n489\n00:25:44.610 --> 00:25:47.760\nAll right, so\nthat is a look at Windows To Go.\n\n490\n00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:53.460\nI am going to shut this guy down,\nso that I can remove it.\n\n491\n00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:58.323\nBecause I want you to see how we can\ndo this through PowerShell, as well.\n\n492\n00:25:58.323 --> 00:26:01.092\nNow, I'm not gonna go through the steps,\nbut\n\n493\n00:26:01.092 --> 00:26:05.760\nI've gathered up the commands necessary\nto do this through PowerShell.\n\n494\n00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:08.660\nI want to show them to you, and I'll make\nsure they’re available in the show notes,\n\n495\n00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:10.360\nso that you guys can study that, as well.\n\n496\n00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:12.970\nBecause we know how Microsoft\nlikes to do on their exam.\n\n497\n00:26:12.970 --> 00:26:16.950\nThey love PowerShell command questions, so\nthe first thing to understand is that I\n\n498\n00:26:16.950 --> 00:26:20.378\ncan create a Windows To Go\nwork space through PowerShell.\n\n499\n00:26:20.378 --> 00:26:24.380\nBut honestly,\n[LAUGH] I don't know why you'd want to.\n\n500\n00:26:24.380 --> 00:26:26.530\nYou saw the wizard, it was so darn easy.\n\n501\n00:26:26.530 --> 00:26:28.600\nIt takes care of everything for me.\n\n502\n00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:32.171\nAnd once I show you these other options,\nor the other way to go you'll be, hm,\n\n503\n00:26:32.171 --> 00:26:33.757\nyeah, I'm gonna use the wizard.\n\n504\n00:26:33.757 --> 00:26:38.378\n&gt;&gt; Yeah Mike, there was a process,\nwhich you still can use,\n\n505\n00:26:38.378 --> 00:26:43.092\ndism, to go ahead and\nmanually create, put an actual image\n\n506\n00:26:43.092 --> 00:26:47.930\nonto the Windows PE environment,\nand have external drive.\n\n507\n00:26:47.930 --> 00:26:50.090\nAnd in the past,\nyou'd have to have multiple drives,\n\n508\n00:26:50.090 --> 00:26:53.390\nand it was an extremely long process and\ncrazy.\n\n509\n00:26:53.390 --> 00:26:56.640\nSo this is one of those things\nwhere Microsoft says look,\n\n510\n00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:59.250\nI recognize that there's a way to do this.\n\n511\n00:26:59.250 --> 00:27:02.380\nLet me see how I can make it better and\nmore convenient for you.\n\n512\n00:27:02.380 --> 00:27:04.760\nSo that's really cool\nwhen we're talking about\n\n513\n00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:06.630\nnot having to go through all those steps.\n\n514\n00:27:06.630 --> 00:27:09.690\nBut PowerShell,\nit's good to know for the exam.\n\n515\n00:27:09.690 --> 00:27:12.310\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, absolutely,\nso let me take a look here.\n\n516\n00:27:13.850 --> 00:27:18.026\nYeah, if you're doing this, like maybe\nyou're assigning Windows To Go drives to\n\n517\n00:27:18.026 --> 00:27:21.450\nyour entire sales department,\nright, or for lots of people.\n\n518\n00:27:21.450 --> 00:27:24.753\nIn that case, looking at\na solution like using PowerShell,\n\n519\n00:27:24.753 --> 00:27:28.012\nbeing able to write scripts and\nautomate it, makes sense.\n\n520\n00:27:28.012 --> 00:27:32.307\nIf I'm just doing a single drive for\nme, the wizard is right there, and\n\n521\n00:27:32.307 --> 00:27:34.180\nit's pretty darn easy to use.\n\n522\n00:27:34.180 --> 00:27:36.948\nSo that's typically what I look at is,\nis this something that I need-\n\n523\n00:27:36.948 --> 00:27:37.757\n&gt;&gt; That's a good way, yeah.\n\n524\n00:27:37.757 --> 00:27:41.129\n&gt;&gt; To do over and over again,\nthen I'm gonna look at PowerShell, and\n\n525\n00:27:41.129 --> 00:27:42.646\nsee how I can script this out.\n\n526\n00:27:42.646 --> 00:27:47.013\nIt's a one time, one and done,\ntype thing, and there's a wizard.\n\n527\n00:27:47.013 --> 00:27:48.917\nI'll probably just use the Wizard.\n\n528\n00:27:48.917 --> 00:27:50.745\nAll right, so\nlet's take a look at my screen here.\n\n529\n00:27:50.745 --> 00:27:53.462\nI am back to my physical host.\n\n530\n00:27:53.462 --> 00:27:58.033\nI've unplugged the drive, and\nI'm gonna move the cable out of the way.\n\n531\n00:27:58.033 --> 00:28:01.142\nSo yes, I'm back to my host.\n\n532\n00:28:01.142 --> 00:28:04.250\nSure, let's open up all those\nthings again, there we go.\n\n533\n00:28:04.250 --> 00:28:06.880\nAnd I've got PowerShell ISE opened up.\n\n534\n00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:08.580\nAnd I got these scripts from Microsoft.\n\n535\n00:28:08.580 --> 00:28:11.360\nSo again,\nI'll make sure they're available for you.\n\n536\n00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:16.360\nBut let's just kind of take a look\nat what we've got going on here.\n\n537\n00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:19.980\nYou can see there first you\nstart with a command disk.\n\n538\n00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:20.610\nThey're setting it.\n\n539\n00:28:20.610 --> 00:28:22.070\nThey've got a variable here.\n\n540\n00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:23.227\nI don't think I can zoom in and\n\n541\n00:28:23.227 --> 00:28:25.273\nscroll around, so\nhopefully you guys can see that.\n\n542\n00:28:25.273 --> 00:28:30.280\nI might be able to make that font a little\nbigger, so you can see everything there.\n\n543\n00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:33.947\nBut first, you're gonna go get your disk,\nright, and\n\n544\n00:28:33.947 --> 00:28:39.505\nthis particular command lists all the USB\ndrives with storage greater than 20 GB.\n\n545\n00:28:39.505 --> 00:28:43.970\nIt shouldn't grab any of your\ninternal drives or tiny thumb drives.\n\n546\n00:28:43.970 --> 00:28:47.340\nShould find the one you want,\nthen you're gonna clear the disk.\n\n547\n00:28:47.340 --> 00:28:49.430\nYou're going to initialize the disk.\n\n548\n00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:51.440\nYou're gonna set that\npartition style to MBR,\n\n549\n00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:55.920\nand you're gonna make\na couple of partitions.\n\n550\n00:28:55.920 --> 00:29:01.230\nRemember, Windows needs their little\nsystem partition, 350 MB, formats,\n\n551\n00:29:01.230 --> 00:29:05.970\nthe volume is FAT32, right,\nwith this format volume command.\n\n552\n00:29:05.970 --> 00:29:10.570\nAnd then, it uses the rest of\nthe space for another partition,\n\n553\n00:29:10.570 --> 00:29:11.930\nfor the OS partition.\n\n554\n00:29:11.930 --> 00:29:17.021\nSo you see, it's gonna create two,\nsystem partition and OS partition, right?\n\n555\n00:29:17.021 --> 00:29:19.457\nNow what's really cool, well,\nactually its not on this screen, so\n\n556\n00:29:19.457 --> 00:29:20.860\nwe'll come to that in a second.\n\n557\n00:29:20.860 --> 00:29:23.890\nSo you made your two partitions,\nyou formatted them,\n\n558\n00:29:23.890 --> 00:29:29.000\nthe system partition is FAT32,\nthe OS partition is going to be NTFS.\n\n559\n00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:32.340\nIt assigns drive letter S to\nthe system partition, and\n\n560\n00:29:32.340 --> 00:29:37.420\nthe drive letter W to the Windows\npartition, or the OS partition.\n\n561\n00:29:37.420 --> 00:29:42.470\nAnd, but then it goes back and it says\nnode default drive letter equal to true.\n\n562\n00:29:42.470 --> 00:29:46.565\nWhich is cool,\nbecause if you label this as W, and\n\n563\n00:29:46.565 --> 00:29:51.928\nyou assign that value,\nwhat if I go to somebody else's system and\n\n564\n00:29:51.928 --> 00:29:57.216\nI try to use my Windows To Go,\nand that letter's already in use?\n\n565\n00:29:57.216 --> 00:29:59.450\nThere could be a chance of a conflict.\n\n566\n00:29:59.450 --> 00:30:01.820\nDrive shouldn't show up, but\n\n567\n00:30:01.820 --> 00:30:04.910\nmaybe you plug in somebody else's\nthumb drive and it's got W.\n\n568\n00:30:04.910 --> 00:30:06.870\nYou can run into some conflicts there.\n\n569\n00:30:06.870 --> 00:30:10.150\nSo they set it to where there\nis no default drive letter.\n\n570\n00:30:10.150 --> 00:30:13.520\nWhich means Windows will just take\nthe next available, if it needs to.\n\n571\n00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:18.180\nAll right, and so all of this\nreally is just setting up the disk.\n\n572\n00:30:18.180 --> 00:30:25.580\nWe just formatted and partitioned, the two\nvolumes, or partitions, on that drive.\n\n573\n00:30:25.580 --> 00:30:29.354\nThen we're gonna use dism\nto apply the image, right?\n\n574\n00:30:29.354 --> 00:30:35.863\nSo this is where you're gonna go\ndism /apply-image/imagefile:n:,\n\n575\n00:30:35.863 --> 00:30:38.867\nand then the path to that win file.\n\n576\n00:30:38.867 --> 00:30:44.140\nWell, wherever, that n: is part of the\npath, so that entire thing is the path.\n\n577\n00:30:44.140 --> 00:30:46.828\nAnd obviously,\nyou'd rename that to whatever yours.\n\n578\n00:30:46.828 --> 00:30:48.800\nMine was install.wim,\n\n579\n00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:53.260\nalso pay attention if there are more\nthan one image within that wim file.\n\n580\n00:30:53.260 --> 00:30:57.350\nYou need to know which one it is, so\nuse your dism commands to figure out which\n\n581\n00:30:57.350 --> 00:31:03.880\nindex number the particular wim file or OS\nimage in the wim file you're going to use.\n\n582\n00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:07.840\nAnd then, apply dir,\nwe're gonna apply that to the w directory,\n\n583\n00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:09.840\nthe one that we just assigned for the OS.\n\n584\n00:31:11.010 --> 00:31:13.270\n&gt;&gt; So, Mike, I'm having a deja vu.\n\n585\n00:31:13.270 --> 00:31:15.200\nI told you there is\nan older way to do this.\n\n586\n00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:17.430\nIt was these steps,\n\n587\n00:31:17.430 --> 00:31:21.590\njust exectuted instead of using\nPowerShell, but you would use Diskpart.\n\n588\n00:31:21.590 --> 00:31:24.000\nSo you would use Diskpart\nto create the partitions.\n\n589\n00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:27.650\nAnd you had a Fat32 and an NTFS partition.\n\n590\n00:31:27.650 --> 00:31:32.260\nAnd you were talking about having\nmultiple OSs in that particular WIN file.\n\n591\n00:31:32.260 --> 00:31:36.840\nSo in the past, if you were using,\nit didn't have an NTFS option before.\n\n592\n00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:39.610\nSo if you had that Fat32\n4 gig limit there for\n\n593\n00:31:39.610 --> 00:31:43.700\nthose files, that's why you previously\nwould have to have multiple drives.\n\n594\n00:31:43.700 --> 00:31:48.040\nSo you would have two external USB drives-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, one for your system-\n\n595\n00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:48.623\n&gt;&gt; Instead of, so yeah,\n\n596\n00:31:48.623 --> 00:31:49.892\nyou can see this evolution,\nit's pretty cool.\n\n597\n00:31:49.892 --> 00:31:52.008\n&gt;&gt; Interesting, that is neat.\n\n598\n00:31:52.008 --> 00:31:55.510\nAll right, so once you apply the image,\nthis one is neat.\n\n599\n00:31:55.510 --> 00:31:57.920\nSo this one is a bcdboot.\n\n600\n00:31:57.920 --> 00:32:02.313\nAgain, if you need help with the syntax\non that, check out microsoft.com or\n\n601\n00:32:02.313 --> 00:32:05.907\ndocs.microsoft.com or\nEmail me here or jump into our forum.\n\n602\n00:32:05.907 --> 00:32:09.100\nI know we've got a couple shows\nwhere we go over bcdboot.\n\n603\n00:32:09.100 --> 00:32:12.440\nBut it's a command line utility to work\nwith our boot files in Windows 10,\n\n604\n00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:14.510\nour modern operating systems.\n\n605\n00:32:14.510 --> 00:32:19.150\nAnd what this does is it copies\nthose boot files over to w:\\Windows.\n\n606\n00:32:19.150 --> 00:32:25.300\nSo to your OS partition, within on that\nWindows To Go Drive that you're building.\n\n607\n00:32:25.300 --> 00:32:28.720\nAnd then this /F ALL /S S:,\n\n608\n00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:35.130\nwhat this does is it copies all\nthe startup files for BIOS or for UEFI.\n\n609\n00:32:35.130 --> 00:32:37.820\nWhich is kind of cool, because that\nmeans I don't have to worry about what\n\n610\n00:32:37.820 --> 00:32:42.560\nthe system is that I'm going to\nI will boot with either one.\n\n611\n00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:48.240\nAnd then after that you're gonna\ngo place this san_policy.xml file\n\n612\n00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:52.870\ninto the root directory of the window's\npartition, for example w: if that's what\n\n613\n00:32:52.870 --> 00:32:59.080\nwe've left it as, and appy-unattend\nthen the path to this XML file.\n\n614\n00:32:59.080 --> 00:33:00.750\nAnd what the heck is that?\n\n615\n00:33:00.750 --> 00:33:01.920\nWell that's this over here.\n\n616\n00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:08.540\nThis san policy, this is why those volumes\ndon't show up from the host machine.\n\n617\n00:33:08.540 --> 00:33:13.184\nSan, not as in [CROSSTALK]\nstorage area yes, exactly.\n\n618\n00:33:13.184 --> 00:33:17.990\nAnd so what you'll see down here\nis it's a san policy number four.\n\n619\n00:33:17.990 --> 00:33:20.750\nAnd SanPolicy number four for\nthis component as well.\n\n620\n00:33:20.750 --> 00:33:26.920\nSo, this is for the x86,\nand this is for 64 bit.\n\n621\n00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:29.910\nAny drives that are non sxs,\n\n622\n00:33:29.910 --> 00:33:33.750\nI can't remember what else\nI wanted to point out here.\n\n623\n00:33:33.750 --> 00:33:39.060\nAnd it's not important if we understand\nthis completely with the ideas again.\n\n624\n00:33:39.060 --> 00:33:44.290\nThis is what is gonna prevent you from\naccessing automatically mounting up\n\n625\n00:33:44.290 --> 00:33:47.456\nlocal drives when you\nare running Windows To Go.\n\n626\n00:33:47.456 --> 00:33:50.290\nWhich obviously makes me\nwonder if I can tweak this and\n\n627\n00:33:50.290 --> 00:33:52.650\nthen mount up local drives and\nuse it as a.\n\n628\n00:33:52.650 --> 00:33:55.700\nAnd testing tool,\njust thinking outside the box here.\n\n629\n00:33:55.700 --> 00:33:56.340\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n630\n00:33:56.340 --> 00:33:59.220\n&gt;&gt; All right, and\nonce we have this stand policy,\n\n631\n00:33:59.220 --> 00:34:03.670\nagain run this command to apply\nthat to the image you're building.\n\n632\n00:34:03.670 --> 00:34:08.780\nAnd then you take this answer file,\nand you're gonna load this up in to\n\n633\n00:34:08.780 --> 00:34:13.990\nSQL in Windows system 32\nsysprep as unattend.xml.\n\n634\n00:34:13.990 --> 00:34:17.590\nAnd this is what prevents\nthe recovery agent\n\n635\n00:34:17.590 --> 00:34:20.410\nfrom being available within Windows To Go.\n\n636\n00:34:21.570 --> 00:34:25.980\nSo again, a lot of stuff that we'd have\nto go through if we wanted to do this,\n\n637\n00:34:25.980 --> 00:34:27.670\nthrough PowerShell.\n\n638\n00:34:27.670 --> 00:34:30.470\nA lot of steps and files,\nthings like that, that we've gotta create.\n\n639\n00:34:30.470 --> 00:34:33.250\nThe wizard hides all\nthis complexity from me.\n\n640\n00:34:33.250 --> 00:34:35.080\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nyou're really lifting up the hood here.\n\n641\n00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:37.550\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but if it's something that\nI need to do over and over and\n\n642\n00:34:37.550 --> 00:34:40.180\nover again,\nthis might be a better way to go.\n\n643\n00:34:40.180 --> 00:34:43.020\nI can start automating that process.\n\n644\n00:34:43.020 --> 00:34:45.390\nSo that, my friends, is Windows To Go.\n\n645\n00:34:45.390 --> 00:34:46.770\nIt's a really cool feature.\n\n646\n00:34:46.770 --> 00:34:50.510\nIt's been around, like I said,\nsince about Windows 7, Windows 8, 8.1.\n\n647\n00:34:50.510 --> 00:34:54.920\nGive it a try if you need a way\nto bring Windows with you.\n\n648\n00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:57.610\nAnd you don't wanna carry\nthat pesky laptop around.\n\n649\n00:34:57.610 --> 00:35:00.530\n&gt;&gt; All right, so we have to go so\nwe can catch up our flight and\n\n650\n00:35:00.530 --> 00:35:03.580\ntake out Windows to go with us,\nthat was bad.\n\n651\n00:35:03.580 --> 00:35:05.470\nOkay, Mike thank you so\nmuch for joining us.\n\n652\n00:35:05.470 --> 00:35:08.280\nThank you for being with us as well,\nbut we will sign out.\n\n653\n00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:09.770\nI've been your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n654\n00:35:09.770 --> 00:35:10.580\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Roderick.\n\n655\n00:35:10.580 --> 00:35:13.645\n&gt;&gt; Se you next time here in ITPro TV.\n\n656\n00:35:13.645 --> 00:35:19.657\n[MUSIC]\n\n657\n00:35:19.657 --> 00:35:23.077\nThank you for watching ITPro.TV.\n\n",

[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:06.395 --> 00:00:08.285\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.285 --> 00:00:10.874\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:10.874 --> 00:00:14.940\n&gt;&gt; Welcome, everyone, to your\nConfiguring Windows Devices series,\n\n7\n00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.000\nstudying up for that 70-697 exam.\n\n8\n00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.010\nI'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n9\n00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.200\nAnd in this episode,\n\n10\n00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.370\nwe'll continue taking a look at on\nhow to configure mobility options.\n\n11\n00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:28.290\nWith us today, back in studios we have Mr.\nMike Rodrick.\n\n12\n00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:29.327\nHow is it going today, Mike?\n\n13\n00:00:29.327 --> 00:00:30.257\n&gt;&gt; It's going great, Cherokee.\n\n14\n00:00:30.257 --> 00:00:31.128\nThanks for having me back.\n\n15\n00:00:31.128 --> 00:00:32.462\nExcited as always.\n\n16\n00:00:32.462 --> 00:00:36.130\nAnd yeah, we got a few more things to\nround out our mobility options, and\n\n17\n00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:38.830\nhonestly, these won't take us that long.\n\n18\n00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:42.070\nBecause there are some things\nleft on the objectives for\n\n19\n00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:46.798\nthe 70-697 exam that either don't exist or\nare going away.\n\n20\n00:00:46.798 --> 00:00:50.308\nSo we're gonna talk about them,\nso that you know what they are.\n\n21\n00:00:50.308 --> 00:00:52.695\nKnow what they're about,\nwhat they used to do, or\n\n22\n00:00:52.695 --> 00:00:57.410\n[LAUGH] are doing currently, just in case\nyou get a question, it's very doubtful.\n\n23\n00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.951\nBecause again,\nsometimes the exam writers and\n\n24\n00:01:00.951 --> 00:01:05.210\nthe Windows developers are not\non the same page, right?\n\n25\n00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.887\nSo it's tough to keep these examples\nup with as fast as Windows-\n\n26\n00:01:07.887 --> 00:01:08.797\n&gt;&gt; Right, I mean,\n\n27\n00:01:08.797 --> 00:01:11.268\nwith our new different\nversions coming out,\n\n28\n00:01:11.268 --> 00:01:14.138\nwe have a Spring creator's\nupdate coming out soon.\n\n29\n00:01:14.138 --> 00:01:14.842\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, looking forward to that.\n\n30\n00:01:14.842 --> 00:01:16.390\n&gt;&gt; We have to be at the forefront for\nthat.\n\n31\n00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:17.420\n&gt;&gt; Timeline, woohoo!\n\n32\n00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:18.700\nAll kinds of good stuff.\n\n33\n00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.730\nBut for the mobility options,\nlike you said,\n\n34\n00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:23.320\nthere are a couple that\nare listed in the objectives that\n\n35\n00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.990\nreally don't exist the same way that\nthey did back in the beginning.\n\n36\n00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.190\nBut like I said,\nlet's talk about them anyway.\n\n37\n00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:32.340\nSo first off is sync options.\n\n38\n00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.700\nAnd I wanna talk about this just briefly.\n\n39\n00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.990\nWe'll cover this a little bit more\nin depth when we get into our\n\n40\n00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.730\nepisodes where we deal with moving\nuser profiles and migrating user data.\n\n41\n00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:46.040\nWe'll take a look at it there.\n\n42\n00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.790\nBut let me show you in the objectives,\nthey simply say configure sync options.\n\n43\n00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.694\nSo when it comes to Windows 10 and\nwe take a look at,\n\n44\n00:01:53.694 --> 00:01:55.946\nI'm just simply going to my Start menu.\n\n45\n00:01:55.946 --> 00:01:59.810\nI'm clicking on my account, and\nI'm gonna choose Change Account Settings.\n\n46\n00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.400\nI could also go to my gear icon.\n\n47\n00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.930\nAll right, and open up Settings,\nand then click on Accounts here.\n\n48\n00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.310\nEither way is gonna get\nme to the same place.\n\n49\n00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.614\nAnd I am signed in with, gosh,\nthat's a horrible picture.\n\n50\n00:02:10.614 --> 00:02:12.491\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna say,\nlook at that great picture, Mike.\n\n51\n00:02:12.491 --> 00:02:16.921\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm signed in with my work\n\n52\n00:02:16.921 --> 00:02:21.110\naccount, and that gives me\nthe ability to do certain things.\n\n53\n00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.170\nOne of them being sync my settings.\n\n54\n00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.290\nBut it is dependent on your\norganization and their policies.\n\n55\n00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.410\nI'll show you where to go and\nwhat you can do.\n\n56\n00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.160\nI just won't be able to do it because\nmy organization doesn't support it.\n\n57\n00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.750\nCrazy here at ITProTV.\n\n58\n00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.150\n&gt;&gt; Those ITProers.\n\n59\n00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.080\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we don't wanna sync our\nsettings across multiple devices,\n\n60\n00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.240\nbecause that means they'd have\nto buy us multiple devices,\n\n61\n00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.570\nand they only bought us one laptop.\n\n62\n00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:48.472\nBut anyway, over here in the left side,\nI can see Sync your settings.\n\n63\n00:02:48.472 --> 00:02:52.860\nI'm gonna click on that, I'm gonna zoom\nback out so you can see the entire screen.\n\n64\n00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.580\nRight up here at the top,\nsync is not available for your account.\n\n65\n00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.580\nContact your system\nadministrator to resolve this.\n\n66\n00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:03.320\nYou, on your laptop or desktop or Windows\n10 device, might see that message or\n\n67\n00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.690\nyou might see a different one that says,\nsign in with a Microsoft or\n\n68\n00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.490\nwork account to use this features.\n\n69\n00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:13.250\nIf you sign in with a local account,\nthis isn't gonna do you any good\n\n70\n00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.910\nbecause you're not gonna be\nable to sync your settings.\n\n71\n00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.680\nBut if you sign in with\na Microsoft account or\n\n72\n00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.370\na work account,\nyou can now start syncing your settings.\n\n73\n00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.500\nThe way this is gonna work is it\nwill store you settings in OneDrive.\n\n74\n00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.090\nAnd then when you log on with that\nsame account on a different device,\n\n75\n00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.040\nthose settings can be pulled down.\n\n76\n00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.250\nNow I should switch\nover to my personal cuz\n\n77\n00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.340\nI've got a second account on here\nthat actually is a Microsoft account.\n\n78\n00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.220\nI just don't know what's\non my screen right now.\n\n79\n00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.660\nI probably have some family photos and\n\n80\n00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:48.390\nthings like that on the background that\nmight not be appropriate for the show.\n\n81\n00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:49.860\nNot that they're bad pictures.\n\n82\n00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.870\n&gt;&gt; I get it.\n&gt;&gt; You know what I mean.\n\n83\n00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.400\nSo I don't wanna show you\nall my personal stuff.\n\n84\n00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.550\nBut I use this feature so\nthat when I'm logged into my laptop,\n\n85\n00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:01.940\nI have a certain background,\nI have certain things going on.\n\n86\n00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:05.790\nWhen I go to my desktop at home,\nthose same features are there.\n\n87\n00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:09.372\nIt's like I'm on the same device, all of\nmy settings carry from one to the other.\n\n88\n00:04:09.372 --> 00:04:10.031\nBut it's very convenient.\n\n89\n00:04:10.031 --> 00:04:10.923\n&gt;&gt; Which could be nice.\n\n90\n00:04:10.923 --> 00:04:15.400\n&gt;&gt; Yes, my work account doesn't\nsupport that, which is okay.\n\n91\n00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.840\nI just can't use it, but\nI can show you these settings.\n\n92\n00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:19.190\nSo let me zoom back in one more time.\n\n93\n00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:20.660\nSorry if I'm making you dizzy.\n\n94\n00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:24.561\nYou would simply turn it on,\nif your account supported it,\n\n95\n00:04:24.561 --> 00:04:26.753\nand I'm gonna scroll down here.\n\n96\n00:04:26.753 --> 00:04:28.292\nAnd these are what I can sync.\n\n97\n00:04:28.292 --> 00:04:32.526\nMy theme, if you've got the dark theme\ngoing or if you've got the, well,\n\n98\n00:04:32.526 --> 00:04:36.763\nI don't know what the latest and\ngreatest movie, some Star Wars icons, or\n\n99\n00:04:36.763 --> 00:04:41.620\nsomething like that on there, you can\nbring the theme with you back and forth.\n\n100\n00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:46.640\nYour Internet Explorer settings, like that\none, that's gonna include my favorites.\n\n101\n00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:48.010\nVery cool there.\n\n102\n00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:49.660\nPasswords that you've stored.\n\n103\n00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:51.520\nHopefully, you're not\nstoring any passwords.\n\n104\n00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.490\nSo that one shouldn't matter to you.\n\n105\n00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:57.338\nLanguage preferences, Ease of Access, and\n\n106\n00:04:57.338 --> 00:05:02.309\nthen some other Windows settings\nthat will get included.\n\n107\n00:05:02.309 --> 00:05:03.168\nSo take a look at that.\n\n108\n00:05:03.168 --> 00:05:06.956\nLike I said, if you're using a Microsoft\naccount or a work account and\n\n109\n00:05:06.956 --> 00:05:11.011\nyour organization supports it,\nthen you'll be able to use this feature.\n\n110\n00:05:11.011 --> 00:05:15.141\nI believe here, we're not using, and\nif I say this on a Microsoft show,\n\n111\n00:05:15.141 --> 00:05:18.666\nwe're not using OneDrive as our\nstorage solution for Cloud,\n\n112\n00:05:18.666 --> 00:05:22.215\nwhich is why we don't have this\nfeature enabled, all right?\n\n113\n00:05:22.215 --> 00:05:23.880\nBut that is syncing your settings again.\n\n114\n00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.980\nIt was under my user account, and then\njust went down to sync your settings, and\n\n115\n00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:30.330\nyou control what is.\n\n116\n00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.520\nThe theme one, be careful with that one.\n\n117\n00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:34.930\nI've seen where, like here,\nI've got my laptop.\n\n118\n00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:37.450\nIt's a different resolution\nthan my desktop at home.\n\n119\n00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:40.020\nMy desktop at home has multiple monitors.\n\n120\n00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:42.056\nSo here I've got one image.\n\n121\n00:05:42.056 --> 00:05:45.492\nI go home, that image is now\nstretched across three screens.\n\n122\n00:05:45.492 --> 00:05:49.634\n&gt;&gt; You fix it on the desktop and\nthen you come back to the laptop, and\n\n123\n00:05:49.634 --> 00:05:50.956\nit's kinda wonky.\n\n124\n00:05:50.956 --> 00:05:55.870\nSo there are some things that don't\ngo as smoothly as you would like.\n\n125\n00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:59.830\nBut as far as Internet Explorer settings,\nthings like that, it works perfectly.\n\n126\n00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:02.300\nAll right, so\nthat is syncing your settings.\n\n127\n00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:05.670\nThe next thing I wanna talk about\nis something known as WiFi Direct.\n\n128\n00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:08.890\nAnd this is something that I\nreally don't know how it fits into\n\n129\n00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:11.000\nthe objectives to be honest with you.\n\n130\n00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.190\nThis isn't something you're gonna\nuse unless you're a developer.\n\n131\n00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:17.575\nBecause Windows,\n\n132\n00:06:17.575 --> 00:06:23.010\nthey have APIs that'll allow you to\nuse this WiFi Direct technology.\n\n133\n00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:26.660\nWhat it is is the ability to\ncreate a peer to peer connection,\n\n134\n00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:32.960\nwithout an access point to different\ndevices, like printing to a printer.\n\n135\n00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:35.800\nWhich we fully support in Windows 10,\nbut you don't really see it.\n\n136\n00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:39.450\nIt's not something I go in and\nconfigure or enable.\n\n137\n00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:43.810\nMiracast is one of Microsoft's\nsolutions for WiFi Direct.\n\n138\n00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:51.892\nSo I can throw my screen up to a TV if\nI have a TV that supports Miracast.\n\n139\n00:06:51.892 --> 00:06:54.336\nBut that's the idea behind WiFi Direct.\n\n140\n00:06:54.336 --> 00:06:58.400\nAgain, as far as the exam goes,\nI'm not really sure where that fits in.\n\n141\n00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:03.526\nUnderstand that WiFi Direct\nis the ability to create\n\n142\n00:07:03.526 --> 00:07:09.010\nwireless connections without\na central access point.\n\n143\n00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:10.165\nSo device to device.\n\n144\n00:07:10.165 --> 00:07:12.678\nSo what we would call it\nthe old peer-to-peer networks,\n\n145\n00:07:12.678 --> 00:07:15.511\nbut we're really not connecting\ncomputer to computer, per se.\n\n146\n00:07:15.511 --> 00:07:18.440\nWe're typically connecting to other\nwireless devices like printers.\n\n147\n00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:20.361\n&gt;&gt; Kind of like a reinvented\nad hoc type situation?\n\n148\n00:07:20.361 --> 00:07:23.042\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, exactly right.\n\n149\n00:07:23.042 --> 00:07:24.602\nAll right, so that's WiFi Direct.\n\n150\n00:07:24.602 --> 00:07:28.177\nSo the next one is going\nto be the sync center.\n\n151\n00:07:28.177 --> 00:07:32.370\nAnd this is one that'll drive crazy\ntoo as you're getting read to study.\n\n152\n00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:36.524\nLet's go over here to the Start menu,\nand I'm gonna start typing in sync.\n\n153\n00:07:36.524 --> 00:07:41.225\nAnd I see Sync your settings,\nSync File Explorer, Sync Arduino clock,\n\n154\n00:07:41.225 --> 00:07:43.862\nlots of other things but no sync center.\n\n155\n00:07:43.862 --> 00:07:45.759\nSo let's type it all the way out.\n\n156\n00:07:45.759 --> 00:07:50.244\nAnd I get some web results where I can go\nout and search for the sync center, but\n\n157\n00:07:50.244 --> 00:07:51.212\nno sync center.\n\n158\n00:07:51.212 --> 00:07:53.458\nSo the sync center is gone.\n\n159\n00:07:53.458 --> 00:07:54.892\nNo, it's not.\n\n160\n00:07:54.892 --> 00:07:59.765\nIf we go to the new fancy Control Panel,\nand we type in sync Center,\n\n161\n00:07:59.765 --> 00:08:02.388\nI get a whole lot of nothing as well.\n\n162\n00:08:02.388 --> 00:08:05.810\nAlmost like the Sync Center is gone,\nagain, it's not gone.\n\n163\n00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:10.703\nWhat we need to do is go\nto the control panel.\n\n164\n00:08:10.703 --> 00:08:14.776\n&gt;&gt; So would you say that this is\nan example of security by obscurity.\n\n165\n00:08:14.776 --> 00:08:18.079\n&gt;&gt; I would say this is an example\nof Microsoft not doing really good\n\n166\n00:08:18.079 --> 00:08:20.088\non the indexing for their searching.\n\n167\n00:08:20.088 --> 00:08:25.364\nSorry, Microsoft, but this one just\ndrives me crazy because I use it well,\n\n168\n00:08:25.364 --> 00:08:28.917\nI don't use it, but\nI've been doing these shows.\n\n169\n00:08:28.917 --> 00:08:31.427\nI don't understand why\nthis one doesn't show up.\n\n170\n00:08:31.427 --> 00:08:34.724\nCuz if I search,\nthere is the Sync Center right there.\n\n171\n00:08:34.724 --> 00:08:37.481\nI'm not making it up there is\nsomething called the Sync Center.\n\n172\n00:08:37.481 --> 00:08:42.684\nIf I go up to search the control panel,\nand I type in Sync Center.\n\n173\n00:08:42.684 --> 00:08:44.063\nAnd I've locked it up here.\n\n174\n00:08:46.829 --> 00:08:50.346\nIt does show up, so\nI can see the Sync Center there, but\n\n175\n00:08:50.346 --> 00:08:55.413\nif I'm already in the control panel\nI've probably found that applet anyway.\n\n176\n00:08:55.413 --> 00:08:58.153\nOops, let's launch that again, so anyway,\n\n177\n00:08:58.153 --> 00:09:02.812\nenough of me complaining about why\nSync Center doesn't show up in the search.\n\n178\n00:09:02.812 --> 00:09:05.731\nIt's not the end of the world,\nwe can always go to the control panel and\n\n179\n00:09:05.731 --> 00:09:06.781\nlaunch the Sync Center.\n\n180\n00:09:06.781 --> 00:09:08.013\n&gt;&gt; What is Sync Center?\n\n181\n00:09:08.013 --> 00:09:10.092\nYeah, that's a great question,\nwhat the heck is it?\n\n182\n00:09:10.092 --> 00:09:12.925\nNow that you've complained\nabout why you can't find it.\n\n183\n00:09:12.925 --> 00:09:15.478\nThe Sync Center has been around for\na while,\n\n184\n00:09:15.478 --> 00:09:19.561\nthis is not new to Windows 10, and\nit was very useful back in the day.\n\n185\n00:09:19.561 --> 00:09:23.562\nThis is when we first started\nusing a lot of portable devices.\n\n186\n00:09:23.562 --> 00:09:27.162\nMP3 players, remember Microsoft Zune?\n\n187\n00:09:27.162 --> 00:09:28.337\nI don't know if you've\never even heard of that.\n\n188\n00:09:28.337 --> 00:09:30.684\n&gt;&gt; Slightly\n&gt;&gt; Might be before your day.\n\n189\n00:09:30.684 --> 00:09:32.971\nThere's some portable MP3 players.\n\n190\n00:09:32.971 --> 00:09:36.139\nDell made a couple-\n&gt;&gt; I had a Dell Jukebox.\n\n191\n00:09:36.139 --> 00:09:37.232\nOoh, a Dell Jukebox, there you go.\n\n192\n00:09:37.232 --> 00:09:38.739\n&gt;&gt; Yeah!\n&gt;&gt; So that was an example an MP3\n\n193\n00:09:38.739 --> 00:09:40.382\nplayer that wasn't a phone, right?\n\n194\n00:09:40.382 --> 00:09:43.693\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; All it did was store MP3s.\n\n195\n00:09:43.693 --> 00:09:47.571\nThe idea behind the Sync Center\nwas that you can create what\n\n196\n00:09:47.571 --> 00:09:51.701\nthey call sync partnerships\nbetween these types of devices.\n\n197\n00:09:51.701 --> 00:09:54.674\nYour phone, an MP3 player,\nthings like that.\n\n198\n00:09:54.674 --> 00:09:58.523\nYou created these partnerships,\nwhich basically meant you plugged it in,\n\n199\n00:09:58.523 --> 00:10:02.308\nyou let Windows recognize it, you come\nin here, you set up a partnership,\n\n200\n00:10:02.308 --> 00:10:03.769\nand you choose what to sync.\n\n201\n00:10:03.769 --> 00:10:08.749\nAnd it might be that you want to sync any\nnewly downloaded music or purchased music\n\n202\n00:10:08.749 --> 00:10:13.233\nfrom your computer out to that what\ndid you call it, Microsoft Jukebox?\n\n203\n00:10:13.233 --> 00:10:13.799\n&gt;&gt; Dell Jukebox.\n\n204\n00:10:13.799 --> 00:10:15.703\n&gt;&gt; Dell Jukebox, sorry, the Dell Jukebox.\n\n205\n00:10:15.703 --> 00:10:19.725\nOr maybe, when you plug in your phone,\nyou want any new contacts synced\n\n206\n00:10:19.725 --> 00:10:23.832\nthe other way, back to your PC to\nupdate your contacts that was the idea.\n\n207\n00:10:23.832 --> 00:10:26.834\nYou create these partnerships and\nthen it would automatically\n\n208\n00:10:26.834 --> 00:10:29.732\ndo this synchronization any\ntime you plugged in the device.\n\n209\n00:10:29.732 --> 00:10:33.572\nAnd you can specify what it was that was\nsyncing and in which direction, right?\n\n210\n00:10:33.572 --> 00:10:37.747\nWe could have contacts coming in but\nphotos going out, or MP3s going out, or\n\n211\n00:10:37.747 --> 00:10:39.174\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n212\n00:10:39.174 --> 00:10:42.671\nAnd you could have multiple partnerships\nfor each one of your different devices.\n\n213\n00:10:42.671 --> 00:10:47.624\nNow, unfortunately, you can see I have no\nsync partnership set up on this computer.\n\n214\n00:10:47.624 --> 00:10:50.210\nI know you probably can't read that,\nbut it's not all that exciting.\n\n215\n00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:51.921\nDon't have any partnerships.\n\n216\n00:10:51.921 --> 00:10:56.564\nIf I go to set up new sync partnership,\nit tells me that there are no devices.\n\n217\n00:10:56.564 --> 00:10:59.788\nAnd you can't set up a partnership\nuntil you recognize the device.\n\n218\n00:10:59.788 --> 00:11:02.263\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I never have used this for\npersonal use, but\n\n219\n00:11:02.263 --> 00:11:06.368\nI know working in business environments,\nI have used Sync Center for work folders.\n\n220\n00:11:06.368 --> 00:11:08.558\nSo, that way we could go ahead and\nshare that way.\n\n221\n00:11:08.558 --> 00:11:11.455\nBut, yeah, not maybe on like client-side.\n\n222\n00:11:11.455 --> 00:11:14.385\nIt does require server-side\nconfiguration there.\n\n223\n00:11:14.385 --> 00:11:19.815\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and so, really the Sync Center\nhas become an interface for\n\n224\n00:11:19.815 --> 00:11:22.160\ndealing with offline files.\n\n225\n00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:25.963\nIn fact, we've done a show on offline\nfiles and we came in here and\n\n226\n00:11:25.963 --> 00:11:30.332\nwe clicked Manage Offline Files to get\nthat process set up on this machine.\n\n227\n00:11:30.332 --> 00:11:34.066\nSo that still works, but everything\nelse is Is I can't find any devices,\n\n228\n00:11:34.066 --> 00:11:38.163\nI don't know Microsoft, maybe there are\nsome devices that I can still plug in and\n\n229\n00:11:38.163 --> 00:11:40.889\ncreate a partnership-\n&gt;&gt; If you go yardsaling-\n\n230\n00:11:40.889 --> 00:11:41.913\n&gt;&gt; But I haven't found any, yeah\n\n231\n00:11:41.913 --> 00:11:42.646\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n232\n00:11:42.646 --> 00:11:44.957\n&gt;&gt; That I plugged in any was able to set\n\n233\n00:11:44.957 --> 00:11:46.640\nup a relationship with.\n\n234\n00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:53.299\nI believe the sync center's kind of\nbeing relegated to the recycle bin.\n\n235\n00:11:53.299 --> 00:11:54.859\nOnce they move offline\nfiles somewhere else,\n\n236\n00:11:54.859 --> 00:11:56.668\nI don't know if sync center\nwill have anything to do.\n\n237\n00:11:56.668 --> 00:12:00.496\nBut like I said, it's still like\nthe engine behind this the sync center is\n\n238\n00:12:00.496 --> 00:12:04.522\nstill very useful as you said, offline\nfiles uses it, work folders uses it.\n\n239\n00:12:04.522 --> 00:12:09.250\nYou'll see that sync icon on your files\nwhen you set up offline files, so\n\n240\n00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:14.133\nit used it's just not used for this\nanymore for syncing between devices and\n\n241\n00:12:14.133 --> 00:12:15.391\nthings like that.\n\n242\n00:12:15.391 --> 00:12:20.489\nIt's used primarily for work folders and\noffline files, all right?\n\n243\n00:12:20.489 --> 00:12:27.118\nAnd part of the reason is because Windows\nhas a new way to do phones, right?\n\n244\n00:12:27.118 --> 00:12:29.051\nCuz really that's what\nwe're looking at nowadays.\n\n245\n00:12:29.051 --> 00:12:33.488\nWe don't see as many MP3 players and\nthings like that.\n\n246\n00:12:33.488 --> 00:12:35.714\nWe still have some iPods and\nstuff like that, but\n\n247\n00:12:35.714 --> 00:12:37.408\nprimarily it's going to be phones.\n\n248\n00:12:37.408 --> 00:12:42.940\nAnd with Windows 10 they have\nan app called the Phone Companion.\n\n249\n00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:45.940\nSo I went and downloaded the Phone\nCompanion so I could show you that.\n\n250\n00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:50.324\nIt's not called out on the objectives\nspecifically, but I wanted to show you\n\n251\n00:12:50.324 --> 00:12:54.303\nthat, so just in case they do ask you\na question about syncing a phone,\n\n252\n00:12:54.303 --> 00:12:55.803\nyou'll know how to do it.\n\n253\n00:12:55.803 --> 00:12:58.845\nSo the Phone Companion,\nI went and launched it, and\n\n254\n00:12:58.845 --> 00:13:01.001\nlet's see if I'll get the message.\n\n255\n00:13:01.001 --> 00:13:04.142\nI don't get the message.\n\n256\n00:13:04.142 --> 00:13:07.490\nI downloaded this earlier today for\nthis demonstration.\n\n257\n00:13:07.490 --> 00:13:11.376\nA really cool app you can see Windows,\nAndroid, iPhone or\n\n258\n00:13:11.376 --> 00:13:14.722\niPad any one of these types\nof devices I can set up.\n\n259\n00:13:14.722 --> 00:13:18.252\nI simply click on this,\nit's gonna launch the wizard.\n\n260\n00:13:18.252 --> 00:13:21.313\nSet it up once, never worry again,\nwe'll show you how.\n\n261\n00:13:21.313 --> 00:13:23.353\nManually move files or\njust change your battery.\n\n262\n00:13:23.353 --> 00:13:28.044\nYou can do some pretty neat things\nhere through the Phone Companion.\n\n263\n00:13:28.044 --> 00:13:33.572\nAnd while it looks great, when I first\nfired this us, right before this episode,\n\n264\n00:13:33.572 --> 00:13:38.617\nI got a little dialogue box that says\nthe Phone Companion app is going away,\n\n265\n00:13:38.617 --> 00:13:42.163\nso it's gonna be removed\nfrom the Microsoft Store.\n\n266\n00:13:42.163 --> 00:13:47.250\nIt's no longer gonna be used either,\nso the Sync Center is replaced, well\n\n267\n00:13:47.250 --> 00:13:53.094\nthe phone syncing part of the Sync Center,\nis really replaced with Phone Companion.\n\n268\n00:13:53.094 --> 00:13:55.208\nThis is going away now.\n\n269\n00:13:55.208 --> 00:13:59.971\nAnd what we have in our Settings is Phone.\n\n270\n00:13:59.971 --> 00:14:02.767\nYou can see they've actually\njust built it right in, so\n\n271\n00:14:02.767 --> 00:14:06.159\ninstead of it being a separate app\nthat I downloaded from the store,\n\n272\n00:14:06.159 --> 00:14:09.033\nthere is a control panel applet\nright here called phone.\n\n273\n00:14:09.033 --> 00:14:14.234\nSo if I click on that that's\ngonna allow me to add phones.\n\n274\n00:14:14.234 --> 00:14:18.750\nYou do have to turn on this Go to Shared\nExperience Setting to link your phone,\n\n275\n00:14:18.750 --> 00:14:20.489\nturn on Shared Experiences.\n\n276\n00:14:20.489 --> 00:14:23.863\n&gt;&gt; And we're recording this at\na particular moment in time.\n\n277\n00:14:23.863 --> 00:14:28.124\nAnd I feel like this is going to be\nchanging also because the way that they're\n\n278\n00:14:28.124 --> 00:14:31.604\nincorporating more mobile with\ntheir Miracast technology.\n\n279\n00:14:31.604 --> 00:14:34.471\nSo who knows what it's gonna\nlook like in the future.\n\n280\n00:14:34.471 --> 00:14:37.778\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, so make sure when\nyou're studying for this exam,\n\n281\n00:14:37.778 --> 00:14:41.341\nlook at the Sync Center,\nknow what options were available in there.\n\n282\n00:14:41.341 --> 00:14:44.855\nI doubt they're gonna ask you too many\nquestions on it because it is something\n\n283\n00:14:44.855 --> 00:14:46.053\nthat is kinda going away.\n\n284\n00:14:46.053 --> 00:14:49.061\nBut they could hit you with work folders,\nor\n\n285\n00:14:49.061 --> 00:14:52.793\nmaybe not work folders in this exam, but-\n&gt;&gt; Offline files?\n\n286\n00:14:52.793 --> 00:14:53.646\n&gt;&gt; Offline files, right?\n\n287\n00:14:53.646 --> 00:14:58.600\nAnd understanding that the Sync Center,\nit's that synchronization engine that's\n\n288\n00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:01.981\ndoing the work for offline files,\nso that's important.\n\n289\n00:15:01.981 --> 00:15:05.989\nUnderstanding that my option to\nmanage my offline files is located in\n\n290\n00:15:05.989 --> 00:15:07.031\nthe Sync Center.\n\n291\n00:15:07.031 --> 00:15:10.320\nSo don't ignore it just because it\ndoesn't really do anything anymore.\n\n292\n00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:12.564\nIt still has some usefulness there.\n\n293\n00:15:12.564 --> 00:15:17.316\nSo I can turn on my shared experiences,\nlet apps and other devices, including\n\n294\n00:15:17.316 --> 00:15:22.075\nlink phones and tablets, open and message\napps on this device and vice versa.\n\n295\n00:15:22.075 --> 00:15:24.281\nSo I could simply turn that on.\n\n296\n00:15:24.281 --> 00:15:28.293\nI've got options here from everyone\nnearby, that does not sound good.\n\n297\n00:15:28.293 --> 00:15:30.621\nI can share and receive from, right?\n\n298\n00:15:30.621 --> 00:15:35.382\nSo now that I've turned that on oops, I\nshould have stayed in the settings there.\n\n299\n00:15:35.382 --> 00:15:38.617\nI'm gonna go back to my Settings,\nand then Phone.\n\n300\n00:15:38.617 --> 00:15:40.720\nAnd then you can see my message is gone.\n\n301\n00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:45.362\nI can click Add a Phone, start typing in\nI don't wanna add my personal phone to\n\n302\n00:15:45.362 --> 00:15:49.376\nmy work computer here, so\nI'm not gonna go through this process.\n\n303\n00:15:49.376 --> 00:15:52.562\nBut this is how you would end\nup linking your phone and\n\n304\n00:15:52.562 --> 00:15:54.673\nyour PC nowadays in Windows 10.\n\n305\n00:15:54.673 --> 00:15:58.200\nLike I said, probably nothing you\nhave to worry about for the exam.\n\n306\n00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:00.788\nBecause they call out the sync\ncenter on the objectives, so\n\n307\n00:16:00.788 --> 00:16:02.201\nmake sure you understand that.\n\n308\n00:16:02.201 --> 00:16:06.643\nI don't think they're going to test\nyou on the phone companion yet\n\n309\n00:16:06.643 --> 00:16:09.110\nbecause that's going away as well.\n\n310\n00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:12.151\nBut that phone option I just showed\nyou will mostly likely be in one\n\n311\n00:16:12.151 --> 00:16:13.880\nof the later exams as they update it.\n\n312\n00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:17.061\nAnd of course, once they update\nthe objectives we'll go through that in\n\n313\n00:16:17.061 --> 00:16:18.376\na little bit of a deeper dive.\n\n314\n00:16:18.376 --> 00:16:19.940\nSo that's the sync center.\n\n315\n00:16:19.940 --> 00:16:22.890\nNow, I said that we're going to\ntalk about a couple of technologies\n\n316\n00:16:22.890 --> 00:16:25.390\nthat seem to be going away,\nbut that there was\n\n317\n00:16:25.390 --> 00:16:29.050\none that I definitely want to point out\nthat's still around and very useful.\n\n318\n00:16:29.050 --> 00:16:31.380\nAnd that is the Windows Mobility Center,\n\n319\n00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:33.680\nthey call this one out on\nthe objectives as well.\n\n320\n00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:35.231\nSo let's take a look at that.\n\n321\n00:16:35.231 --> 00:16:39.500\nI'm going to go to my start menu,\nand I'm going to type in mobility.\n\n322\n00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:42.130\nAnd there I can see my\nWindows Mobility Center.\n\n323\n00:16:42.130 --> 00:16:47.250\nAnd for mobile devices, laptops,\nthese settings are really cool.\n\n324\n00:16:47.250 --> 00:16:50.210\nI loved this concept when they came out\nwith it, I thought it was pretty neat.\n\n325\n00:16:50.210 --> 00:16:54.430\nBecause what it's doing is it's gathering\nup a bunch of the different settings\n\n326\n00:16:54.430 --> 00:16:58.220\nthat are gonna be important to me\non a mobile device, all right.\n\n327\n00:16:58.220 --> 00:17:01.790\nIf we take a look at whats in here\nI can see display brightness.\n\n328\n00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:04.920\nAnd we know with mobile devices\nwe're always trying to control\n\n329\n00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:08.270\npower consumption, so\nI can adjust my brightness from here.\n\n330\n00:17:08.270 --> 00:17:10.230\nGot my volume, I can mute it.\n\n331\n00:17:10.230 --> 00:17:16.763\nI've got my battery status where I\ncan change power plans here as well.\n\n332\n00:17:16.763 --> 00:17:20.707\nI can rotate the screen\ndisplay if I want to.\n\n333\n00:17:20.707 --> 00:17:23.454\nRight now I am piping out\nto an external display so\n\n334\n00:17:23.454 --> 00:17:26.350\nthat you guys can see what's\ngoing on in my screen.\n\n335\n00:17:26.350 --> 00:17:27.920\nI got my sync settings and\n\n336\n00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:31.320\nmy sync center which used to be\na little more useful than it is now.\n\n337\n00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:34.190\nAnd then I've got this\npresentation settings option.\n\n338\n00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:41.054\nSo it's gathering up a lot of these things\nthat I find useful on a mobile device.\n\n339\n00:17:41.054 --> 00:17:45.043\nAll right and this one in particular, the\nPresentation Settings cuz if you're giving\n\n340\n00:17:45.043 --> 00:17:48.375\npresentation, you're typically gonna\ntake your laptop with you, and\n\n341\n00:17:48.375 --> 00:17:50.833\nyou're gonna go give\na presentation somewhere, and\n\n342\n00:17:50.833 --> 00:17:53.760\nyou'll stand up at the front\nof the room at this podium.\n\n343\n00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:55.900\nOr in a conference room at\nthe head of the table or\n\n344\n00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:58.870\nsomething like that and\nyou're gonna give this presentation.\n\n345\n00:17:58.870 --> 00:18:02.210\nAnd there's some things that\ncan make your presentation go\n\n346\n00:18:02.210 --> 00:18:04.170\nnot as smoothly as you would like.\n\n347\n00:18:04.170 --> 00:18:06.660\nOne would be having that picture\n\n348\n00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:11.180\nof your kids riding the dog through\nthe sprinkler on your background.\n\n349\n00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:13.990\nGreat picture, but\nnot real professional, right?\n\n350\n00:18:13.990 --> 00:18:18.320\nProbably not what you want to\nshow at this business meeting or\n\n351\n00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:22.755\nin a hall of 500 people staring\nup at your screen on a projector.\n\n352\n00:18:22.755 --> 00:18:25.975\nYou don't want your\ndisplay to go to sleep.\n\n353\n00:18:25.975 --> 00:18:28.675\nYou're gonna be presenting, you might\nnot touch the computer for three, or\n\n354\n00:18:28.675 --> 00:18:31.295\nfour minutes as you talk, and present.\n\n355\n00:18:31.295 --> 00:18:33.865\nWell if you're screen goes dark in\nthe middle of that, that's not good for\n\n356\n00:18:33.865 --> 00:18:35.185\nyour presentation.\n\n357\n00:18:35.185 --> 00:18:39.025\nIt can also be trouble if all the\nlighting, cuz they usually dim the lights,\n\n358\n00:18:39.025 --> 00:18:41.791\nright, so\nthat everybody can see your presentation.\n\n359\n00:18:41.791 --> 00:18:45.770\nAll of a sudden your screen goes black and\nit's dark and pandemonium ensues.\n\n360\n00:18:45.770 --> 00:18:49.440\nNo, I'm just kidding, but\nyou don't want your screen to go to sleep.\n\n361\n00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:55.630\nAll those can be controlled quickly and\neasily through this presentation settings.\n\n362\n00:18:55.630 --> 00:18:56.460\nNow I am trying to think,\n\n363\n00:18:56.460 --> 00:19:01.900\nI can't turn this on because I am in\nthe middle of presenting to you guys and\n\n364\n00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:05.060\nI don't want to kill my display feed or\nanything like that.\n\n365\n00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:09.030\nBut what I can show you\nis presentation settings.\n\n366\n00:19:09.030 --> 00:19:12.200\nSo I simply went to my Start menu,\nand I typed in, and\n\n367\n00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:14.310\nI can't zoom in on the Start menu, sorry.\n\n368\n00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:15.860\nI typed in presentation,\n\n369\n00:19:15.860 --> 00:19:20.236\nand you can see right here adjust\nsettings before giving a presentation.\n\n370\n00:19:20.236 --> 00:19:25.113\nAll right, it's a Control Panel applet and\nI pull this up and here's my options,\n\n371\n00:19:25.113 --> 00:19:26.140\nall right?\n\n372\n00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:29.670\nI can turn it on from right here,\ncurrently giving a presentation.\n\n373\n00:19:29.670 --> 00:19:33.110\nI can say when I'm giving a presentation,\nturn off the screen saver.\n\n374\n00:19:33.110 --> 00:19:35.780\nGood idea,\nI don't want the screen saver kicking in.\n\n375\n00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:38.700\nI can set the volume to\na particular level, and\n\n376\n00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:42.280\nI can pick a particular background,\nall right?\n\n377\n00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:45.940\nAnd I can choose how to position it or\nwhatever.\n\n378\n00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:49.598\nI can browse and find another image if\nit's not in the list and I can click OK.\n\n379\n00:19:49.598 --> 00:19:54.845\nAnd so now all of those settings\nare stored in my presentation settings.\n\n380\n00:19:54.845 --> 00:19:57.931\nSo if I go to do a presentation\nI don't have to go and\n\n381\n00:19:57.931 --> 00:20:01.545\nmute my speakers or change-\n&gt;&gt; That's the last thing you want to worry\n\n382\n00:20:01.545 --> 00:20:05.282\nabout when you might have nerves kicking\nin and everything it's just like hey,\n\n383\n00:20:05.282 --> 00:20:08.465\nI've already set this up when\nI was calm at home, tested it.\n\n384\n00:20:08.465 --> 00:20:09.577\nWe should be good to go, right?\n\n385\n00:20:09.577 --> 00:20:11.892\n&gt;&gt; Exactly,\nyou've got it all pre-configured.\n\n386\n00:20:11.892 --> 00:20:14.285\nI'll go and click on it and\nlet's see what it does.\n\n387\n00:20:14.285 --> 00:20:17.276\nIf it kills my screen feed Titus will\nyell at me and I'll turn it off and\n\n388\n00:20:17.276 --> 00:20:18.113\nwe'll come back.\n\n389\n00:20:18.113 --> 00:20:23.597\nBut I say turn on and there you go\nyou can see that background changed.\n\n390\n00:20:23.597 --> 00:20:28.307\nI didn't choose to mute, in fact let's\nturn it off and so currently I'm muted and\n\n391\n00:20:28.307 --> 00:20:30.028\nmy volume is all the way down.\n\n392\n00:20:30.028 --> 00:20:34.617\nLet's change the brightness\nabout a halfway all right and\n\n393\n00:20:34.617 --> 00:20:37.550\nnow when I click turn on.\n\n394\n00:20:37.550 --> 00:20:40.120\nNotice I'm unmuted,\nit didn't change my brightness.\n\n395\n00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:44.180\nI have to go check, I might not have\nchanged that in my presentation settings\n\n396\n00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:45.270\nwhen I opened that up.\n\n397\n00:20:45.270 --> 00:20:50.000\nBut you can see now with one click,\nI can turn my presentation settings on or\n\n398\n00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:51.730\noff, very, very handy.\n\n399\n00:20:51.730 --> 00:20:54.210\nI like the Mobility Center in general.\n\n400\n00:20:54.210 --> 00:20:59.050\nBringing a lot of the mobile options\ninto one central location is cool.\n\n401\n00:20:59.050 --> 00:21:03.700\nBut then the presentation settings is\nthe icing on the cake if you will.\n\n402\n00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:07.940\nI love the one-click capability to\nturn on that presentation mode.\n\n403\n00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:11.850\nAnd maybe you're not doing it with\na projector in an auditorium, but\n\n404\n00:21:11.850 --> 00:21:15.070\nmaybe you have meetings where\npeople gather around your machine.\n\n405\n00:21:15.070 --> 00:21:20.004\nAgain, you can set those settings, click\none button, and boom you're good to go.\n\n406\n00:21:20.004 --> 00:21:22.460\nSo that is a look at the mobility options.\n\n407\n00:21:22.460 --> 00:21:24.910\nWe've gone through a few\nepisodes covering these.\n\n408\n00:21:24.910 --> 00:21:28.228\nBut hopefully that gives you a heads\nup when it comes to mobility options on\n\n409\n00:21:28.228 --> 00:21:29.360\nthe 70-697 exam.\n\n410\n00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:32.777\n&gt;&gt; Well thank you for taking the time to\neven look at some of those older options\n\n411\n00:21:32.777 --> 00:21:34.740\nand at least we'll be prepared for those.\n\n412\n00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:35.600\nThanks, Mike.\n\n413\n00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:38.350\nThank you for joining us as well,\nbut for now let's sign out.\n\n414\n00:21:38.350 --> 00:21:39.728\nI've been your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n415\n00:21:39.728 --> 00:21:40.571\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n416\n00:21:40.571 --> 00:21:43.860\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at

to\n\n14\n00:00:40.525 --> 00:00:43.481\nmanaging our Windows devices, Windows 10.\n\n15\n00:00:43.481 --> 00:00:47.227\nSo I wanna take a look at\nusing a mobile device manager,\n\n16\n00:00:47.227 --> 00:00:50.980\nin particular Intune,\nto manage our mobile devices.\n\n17\n00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.760\nAnd let's look at a little bit of not so\nmuch history,\n\n18\n00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.300\nbut kinda talk about the way\nthings are trending right now.\n\n19\n00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.515\nAnd it is tricky to keep up sometimes.\n\n20\n00:01:00.515 --> 00:01:03.710\nWhen I come from, I've been doing this for\na little while, and\n\n21\n00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.050\nI come from working in on\nprem type facilities or\n\n22\n00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:10.980\nnetworks where everything was managed,\nActive Directory was the thing, right?\n\n23\n00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:15.550\nGroup policy is magic,\nit allows me to manage anywhere from\n\n24\n00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:20.510\n10 devices to 10,000 devices,\nsimply by creating a single policy.\n\n25\n00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:24.941\nIt's a fantastic thing,\nwe've love it, it's great.\n\n26\n00:01:24.941 --> 00:01:27.046\nBut today's networks are changing, right?\n\n27\n00:01:27.046 --> 00:01:32.069\nIt's not just enterprise devices that\nwe're managing that stay here on premises,\n\n28\n00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:36.540\nand that I can apply group policy to\nbecause they're joined to the domain.\n\n29\n00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.110\nAnd we restrict access to enterprise\nresources to domain members.\n\n30\n00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:46.210\nThat's not the model anymore, we're\nseeing it shift to where it is more BYOD,\n\n31\n00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:47.630\nright, bring your own device.\n\n32\n00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.500\nI can actually, I should be able to,\nmy users want to, I say should be able to.\n\n33\n00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.850\nMy users wanna be able to access\nresources from anywhere, from any device.\n\n34\n00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.440\nAnd that changes the game in\na way we manage those devices.\n\n35\n00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.233\n&gt;&gt; It certainly complicates things,\n\n36\n00:02:02.233 --> 00:02:03.494\nwe'll say that, yeah.\n\n37\n00:02:03.494 --> 00:02:04.370\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n38\n00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:07.330\nit was a lot easier when it was one or\ntwo operating systems and\n\n39\n00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.830\na known set of hardware,\nit was a whole lot easier.\n\n40\n00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.159\nBut as the networks and\nour infrastructure changes,\n\n41\n00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:19.491\nour management tools change,\nthe way we manage our networks change.\n\n42\n00:02:19.491 --> 00:02:21.810\nAnd Microsoft is doing a really\ngood job of keeping up.\n\n43\n00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:22.310\nIt's just hard for\n\n44\n00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.690\nus sometimes to keep up with Microsoft\nwhen it comes to studying for these exams.\n\n45\n00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.960\nSo as we see this shift, though,\n\n46\n00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:36.110\nMicrosoft has given us a way through\nthings like Microsoft Intune\n\n47\n00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.610\nto manage more than just our\nWindows 10 domain members, right?\n\n48\n00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.100\nGroup policy's still around,\nit hasn't gone away.\n\n49\n00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.810\nAnd it is ideal for\nmanaging our desktop environments,\n\n50\n00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.580\nour standard type networks that\nwe're used to dealing with.\n\n51\n00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.600\nThere are thousands and\nthousands of settings In a group policy.\n\n52\n00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:59.350\nI can control just about every\nsingle aspect of that machine.\n\n53\n00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:05.330\nBut as we shift and we see this change\nin the devices that we're using,\n\n54\n00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.130\nwe have to use other means to manage them,\n\n55\n00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:10.580\nbecause they're not like those,\nyour iPhone is not a part of my domain.\n\n56\n00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:15.980\nSo I cannot apply group policy to it,\nyour Android device, your iPad,\n\n57\n00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.500\nyour home laptop, and all of the stuff\nthat I want to be able to manage.\n\n58\n00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.390\nI wanna be able to give you\naccess to cooperate resources.\n\n59\n00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.909\n&gt;&gt; Of course you do,\n\n60\n00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:25.922\nit'll mean you'll be able to work more,\nthat's what it is, Mike.\n\n61\n00:03:25.922 --> 00:03:27.090\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, yes.\n\n62\n00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.430\nIf you're gonna work from home for\nfree, that's great.\n\n63\n00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.640\nI'm kidding, sort of.\n\n64\n00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.460\nBut how do I manage that device?\n\n65\n00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:38.850\nIt's not part of my domain, yet I'm giving\nyou access to the corporate network or\n\n66\n00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:40.400\ncertain corporate resources.\n\n67\n00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:41.860\nHow do I know what malware is on there?\n\n68\n00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:43.450\nAre you running Windows Defender?\n\n69\n00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.020\nOr do you have a firewall on there?\n\n70\n00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:50.280\nIs that device safe as I allow it\nto connect to these resources?\n\n71\n00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.110\nOr is loaded up with malware and\nnow you're gonna infect my network\n\n72\n00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:57.970\npotentially, or open up security holes and\nvulnerabilities in our network\n\n73\n00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:00.850\nby connecting that device to our network?\n&gt;&gt; So what can we do,\n\n74\n00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:03.190\nMike?\n&gt;&gt; Well, that's where Azure and\n\n75\n00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:06.090\nMicrosoft In tune come into play,\nall right?\n\n76\n00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.470\nNow, Microsoft Intune has been around for\na little while.\n\n77\n00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:11.484\nIt was a stand alone product.\n\n78\n00:04:11.484 --> 00:04:16.135\nIt has now been integrated into Azure,\nand this process has been going on for\n\n79\n00:04:16.135 --> 00:04:17.200\nsome time.\n\n80\n00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:21.650\nThey've just recently shut down what\nthey call the classic portal for\n\n81\n00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:25.770\nMicrosoft Intune, and\nthey've moved everything into the portal.\n\n82\n00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:29.120\nSo if you're familiar with working\nwith Intune outside of Azure,\n\n83\n00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.950\nyou got a little bit of a leg up.\n\n84\n00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:34.380\nBut you really need to start getting\nfamiliar with the console, and\n\n85\n00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.720\nwhat's available in Intune through Azure.\n\n86\n00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.581\nAnd it's great that it all\ngets tied together, all right?\n\n87\n00:04:40.581 --> 00:04:45.900\nBut through intune, we can manage\ndevices that are not part of my domain.\n\n88\n00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:50.640\nWe don't have the same granularity\nof control with group policy, but\n\n89\n00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:54.420\nwe have enough, and they're adding\nmore and more all of the time.\n\n90\n00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:59.190\nBecause eventually, and I'm just guessing\nhere, I don't have a crystal ball, but\n\n91\n00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:02.580\nyou see this trend where this\nis the management of the future.\n\n92\n00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:06.901\nThis is how we're gonna manage\ndevices is through something,\n\n93\n00:05:06.901 --> 00:05:11.466\nsome kinda what they call MDM or\nmobile device management system,\n\n94\n00:05:11.466 --> 00:05:14.415\nlike Window or Microsoft Intune, right?\n\n95\n00:05:14.415 --> 00:05:17.736\nTo manage a device with Intune,\nit needs to be registered.\n\n96\n00:05:17.736 --> 00:05:23.225\nWe register our users,\ncan enroll their devices in Intune,\n\n97\n00:05:23.225 --> 00:05:28.360\nand that can be a domain member or\na BYOD type device.\n\n98\n00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:33.020\nAnd Intune will let us manage multiple\ndevices, not just Windows 10.\n\n99\n00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:37.380\nWe can manage all of our Windows\nplatforms, at least the modern versions of\n\n100\n00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:43.220\nour Windows operating systems, as well\nas iOS devices and Android devices.\n\n101\n00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:46.575\nOne thing you will have to keep in mind\nis it's not the same across the board.\n\n102\n00:05:46.575 --> 00:05:50.429\nOne setting might apply to Windows device,\nbut\n\n103\n00:05:50.429 --> 00:05:55.645\nthat same setting's not available\non an Android phone or iPad.\n\n104\n00:05:55.645 --> 00:05:58.895\nOr it might be a setting that I can\napply to an iPad that doesm't apply to\n\n105\n00:05:58.895 --> 00:06:02.313\nanything else, right, because each\nplatform's slightly different,\n\n106\n00:06:02.313 --> 00:06:03.820\ndifferent options available.\n\n107\n00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:07.023\nSo this is not consistent across there.\n\n108\n00:06:07.023 --> 00:06:10.050\nAnd again, some features might\nnot be available to get.\n\n109\n00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:14.160\nThere might be settings on that\niPad that I cannot control through\n\n110\n00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.930\nMicrosoft Intune because they\nhaven't added their support yet, but\n\n111\n00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:20.380\nthey're constantly updating and\nadding that.\n\n112\n00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:24.240\nAnd we control these devices\nthrough security policies.\n\n113\n00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:26.810\nNow, do be careful as\nyou're studying up on this,\n\n114\n00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:30.190\nyou might read about Microsoft Intune and\n\n115\n00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:34.890\nsee them mention things like templates and\ndefault templates and things like that.\n\n116\n00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:38.108\nIn the classic console,\nthere were templates.\n\n117\n00:06:38.108 --> 00:06:42.800\nThese were kinda predefined policies that\nhad certain configurations that they\n\n118\n00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:46.170\nthought you might be able to use, right?\n&gt;&gt; Kinda like what we would see\n\n119\n00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:47.940\nin group policy, Mike?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n120\n00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:51.700\nexactly, it's just preconfigured,\nlike, hey, this is a really good one\n\n121\n00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:55.664\nto use on a Windows 10 device that's part\nof a domain or is not part of a domain.\n\n122\n00:06:55.664 --> 00:06:59.270\nBut here's a default template for\nan iOS-type device.\n\n123\n00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:00.980\nAnd they give us those templates.\n\n124\n00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:04.349\nAnd we can either use them as is,\nor we can tweak them and\n\n125\n00:07:04.349 --> 00:07:06.270\nmodify them to suit our needs.\n\n126\n00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:10.600\nWhen Microsoft moved Intune into Azure,\nthose template went away, all right?\n\n127\n00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:16.570\nIt's more focused on providing all of\nthe different settings that are available,\n\n128\n00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:20.670\nbut we're left on our own\nto create these policies.\n\n129\n00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:22.790\nSo just be careful with that\nwhen you start studying for\n\n130\n00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:26.090\nthis exam, understand that it's,\nagain, changing really fast.\n\n131\n00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:31.180\nIn fact, it was just April of this year,\n2018, at the time of this episode filming,\n\n132\n00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:34.070\nthat they shut down access\nto the classic portal.\n\n133\n00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:35.730\nI mean, it's been going on for\na long time.\n\n134\n00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:38.238\nEvery time you go into Azure\nover the last year, or\n\n135\n00:07:38.238 --> 00:07:41.942\nif you went to Microsoft Intune,\nthe classic portal, it would tell you,\n\n136\n00:07:41.942 --> 00:07:46.155\nyou need to start moving to Azure because\nwe are eventually going to take this away.\n\n137\n00:07:46.155 --> 00:07:49.570\nThey've finally taken it away,\nso it is gone.\n\n138\n00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:50.280\nWhich is okay with me,\n\n139\n00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:53.260\nthat's just one less thing that we\nhave to deal with right now, right?\n\n140\n00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:56.338\nNow we've got it built into Azure.\n\n141\n00:07:56.338 --> 00:07:59.840\nSo let's take a look at, I'm trying\nto think of where we should start.\n\n142\n00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:01.499\nLet's enroll a device.\n\n143\n00:08:01.499 --> 00:08:03.456\nFirst, kind of get that ball rolling and\n\n144\n00:08:03.456 --> 00:08:07.315\nthen we'll take a look at Intune through\nAzure and see all the possibilities and\n\n145\n00:08:07.315 --> 00:08:10.730\ndifferent things that we need\nto be aware of for this exam.\n\n146\n00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:15.530\nDo keep in mind as you're studying for\nthis, set up a trial account with Azure.\n\n147\n00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:16.460\nSet up a trial account.\n\n148\n00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:19.640\nYou can get a trial from Microsoft Intune.\n\n149\n00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:24.260\nYou can enroll your own phone, and\nyour home devices and things like that and\n\n150\n00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:25.510\npractice managing.\n\n151\n00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:30.020\nDo keep in mind, though,\nthat it's not instant, right?\n\n152\n00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:34.060\nIf I go and create a policy,\nI can't go straight to that machine and\n\n153\n00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:36.730\nsee that policy change all the time.\n\n154\n00:08:36.730 --> 00:08:38.080\nSometimes it's quicker than others.\n\n155\n00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:39.500\nIt really just depends on.\n\n156\n00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:42.050\nWhat pulling intervals are set up?\n\n157\n00:08:42.050 --> 00:08:44.380\nWhen the last time it checked in?\n\n158\n00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:48.130\nHad replication between data\ncenters as far as Azure\n\n159\n00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:49.160\ngoes.\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n160\n00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:52.270\n&gt;&gt; You know, so there's a lot of factors\n\n161\n00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:58.150\nthat impact how long it takes to\nsee a change or a policy apply.\n\n162\n00:08:58.150 --> 00:09:01.630\nWhich can be frustrating when you're\ntrying to do demonstrations because I\n\n163\n00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:03.500\ncreate a policy and\nthen you go look at the console and\n\n164\n00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:05.310\nit says zero devices are compliant.\n\n165\n00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:07.280\nYou're like,\nyeah I wanted to show you this.\n\n166\n00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:09.870\nSo just keep that in mind.\n\n167\n00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:11.770\nAll right, so\njoin me here on my screen if you will.\n\n168\n00:09:11.770 --> 00:09:13.840\nYou already have, thank you Aubrey.\n\n169\n00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:17.460\nWe are on a Windows 10 machine and\nthis is actually a domain member.\n\n170\n00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:21.885\nSo this is part of our little test domain,\nand I'm logged on as you Cherokee.\n\n171\n00:09:21.885 --> 00:09:23.091\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n172\n00:09:23.091 --> 00:09:23.915\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, I stole your password from you.\n\n173\n00:09:23.915 --> 00:09:31.070\n[LAUGH] And I'm gonna open up my settings\napp, and I'm gonna go to accounts, right?\n\n174\n00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:32.970\nSo again, this is a domain member.\n\n175\n00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:34.890\nI'm logged on with the domain account.\n\n176\n00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:39.415\nSo I could manage this\ndevice through group policy.\n\n177\n00:09:39.415 --> 00:09:42.880\nOkay, but I wanna be able to\nmanage this through Intune, and\n\n178\n00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:45.100\nmake resources available through Intune.\n\n179\n00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:48.180\nLike we've had other episodes where\nwe've pushed out software, or\n\n180\n00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:49.350\nmade software available.\n\n181\n00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:52.880\nA line of business apps, store apps,\nside-loading, deep linking,\n\n182\n00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:58.580\nwe've seen that, and that's all because\nthe device was tied into Azure and Intune.\n\n183\n00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:04.290\nSo, what a user can do is they can\nenroll their device with Intune,\n\n184\n00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:06.360\nor with Microsoft Intune and Azure.\n\n185\n00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:08.820\nWhat was I gonna say there?\n\n186\n00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:13.160\nSo if they're given permission,\nthat's what I was gonna say.\n\n187\n00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:16.540\nIt is something that I can\ncontrol as an Azure admin.\n\n188\n00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:20.690\nI can decide if any users\nare allowed to enroll devices.\n\n189\n00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:24.110\nOr if a subset of users,\nor all users, or no users,\n\n190\n00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:27.120\nare allowed to enroll their devices,\nright?\n\n191\n00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:28.580\nAnd we'll take a look\nat that screen again.\n\n192\n00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:31.930\nThat's more of the Azure side of things,\nand we have hours and\n\n193\n00:10:31.930 --> 00:10:35.990\nhours of episodes on Azure and\nmanaging devices through there.\n\n194\n00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:38.530\nI wanna really focus on the client side.\n\n195\n00:10:38.530 --> 00:10:40.790\nAlthough, we're gonna spend\na lot of time in Azure,\n\n196\n00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:43.020\nactually, when we look at Intune.\n\n197\n00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:46.290\nSo what a user would do is they would\ncome over here to their settings\n\n198\n00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:47.790\nlike I just did.\n\n199\n00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:50.320\nAnd then there is access work or school.\n\n200\n00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:51.660\nThey click on that.\n\n201\n00:10:52.972 --> 00:10:56.350\nWe'll see,\nlooks like I have already done this.\n\n202\n00:10:56.350 --> 00:10:58.853\nSo what I did was I clicked Connect.\n\n203\n00:11:01.175 --> 00:11:04.200\nAnd then I logged in\nwith that email address.\n\n204\n00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:06.820\nNow, I won't do it again because\nI've already set this up again.\n\n205\n00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:09.900\nI didn't want the timing\nto throw our episode off.\n\n206\n00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:12.680\nForgot I had already set this up.\n\n207\n00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:16.159\nBut I used, as you can see here,\ncherokee@itprotvdemo.com.\n\n208\n00:11:16.159 --> 00:11:20.050\nSo I've put that email\naddress in that field.\n\n209\n00:11:20.050 --> 00:11:24.440\nI had to authenticate, provide my\npassword, and it's now connected.\n\n210\n00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:28.910\nSo it's connected to both,\nthis bottom one is my on-prem domain,\n\n211\n00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:32.700\nmy active directory domain,\nitprotvdemo.com.\n\n212\n00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:37.172\nThis one right here is me\nregistering with Intune,\n\n213\n00:11:37.172 --> 00:11:40.445\nright, or really enrolling with Intune.\n\n214\n00:11:41.690 --> 00:11:43.756\nAll right, so once that's done,\n\n215\n00:11:43.756 --> 00:11:47.080\nthat device will now show\nup in my Intune console.\n\n216\n00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:51.090\nAnd I can use my mobile device\nmanagement to manage that device.\n\n217\n00:11:51.090 --> 00:11:51.870\nSo let's do that.\n\n218\n00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:54.170\nLet's jump out to the portal.\n\n219\n00:11:54.170 --> 00:11:56.210\nWhich I've all ready logged on and\n\n220\n00:11:57.300 --> 00:12:00.240\nI've got Intune loaded up\nright here in my blade.\n\n221\n00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:02.780\nIf I can zoom in on over there\nyou can see that right there.\n\n222\n00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:05.800\nI have also got it pinned\nout to my dashboard but\n\n223\n00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:07.950\nwhen you first come in\nyou're not gonna see Intune.\n\n224\n00:12:07.950 --> 00:12:10.940\nSo if you jump into Azure and\nyou go, why don't I see Intune?\n\n225\n00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:14.570\nIt was right there, and when Mike was\nshowing me this, that's two things.\n\n226\n00:12:14.570 --> 00:12:18.890\nOne, I've signed up for\nan Intune trial, right?\n\n227\n00:12:18.890 --> 00:12:24.330\nSo I have an Intune subscription running\nright now tied to my Azure subscription.\n\n228\n00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:28.580\nAnd I searched, and found, and added this,\nand pinned it up here to my favorites.\n\n229\n00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:32.430\nYou would simply go to All Services,\ntype in Intune.\n\n230\n00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:36.740\nAnd you'll find Intune and\nclick that to put a little star there.\n\n231\n00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:40.590\nThat's what gives you the access\nto it off of your favorites list.\n\n232\n00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:48.420\nYou can also launch Intune and then choose\nto, my resolution's a little low here.\n\n233\n00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:50.660\nPin it to your dashboard.\n\n234\n00:12:50.660 --> 00:12:54.407\nAnd once you do that, like I've done here,\nI was disappointed actually.\n\n235\n00:12:54.407 --> 00:12:57.988\nI was fully expecting when I pinned\nit to my dashboard to see some kinda\n\n236\n00:12:57.988 --> 00:12:59.160\nstatistics-\n&gt;&gt; Like a widget or something?\n\n237\n00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:01.643\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, not just a static little image,\n\n238\n00:13:01.643 --> 00:13:03.305\ncuz you can resize these.\n\n239\n00:13:03.305 --> 00:13:06.260\nAnd I was I was like ooh, let's make\nit bigger, so I can see more data.\n\n240\n00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:08.570\n&gt;&gt; That is a little discouraging,\n\n241\n00:13:08.570 --> 00:13:12.500\nbecause a lot of the Azure interfaces are\nreally nice with those little graphs and\n\n242\n00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:13.180\ncharts.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n243\n00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:16.320\nI got all of my live\ntiles on my start menu.\n\n244\n00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:17.720\nI kinda have live tiles here.\n\n245\n00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:20.545\nI'm sure it's coming, Microsoft is\nI'm sure working on that right now.\n\n246\n00:13:20.545 --> 00:13:21.260\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n247\n00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:22.090\n&gt;&gt; Alright, but\n\n248\n00:13:22.090 --> 00:13:25.880\nanyway, I can launch Intune\nthrough that option as well.\n\n249\n00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:28.800\nAnd so this is Intune, now there is\na link here to the classic portal.\n\n250\n00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:31.430\nI think we peaked at\nthat in another episode.\n\n251\n00:13:31.430 --> 00:13:32.860\nIt doesn't work anymore.\n\n252\n00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:37.171\nOne, no browsers will support it\nexcept for like, Internet Explorer.\n\n253\n00:13:37.171 --> 00:13:38.029\n&gt;&gt; In compatibility mode?\n\n254\n00:13:38.029 --> 00:13:38.636\n&gt;&gt; If there's age or\n\n255\n00:13:38.636 --> 00:13:41.490\nsomething, yeah, it's the old\nInternet Explorer, not Edge, not Chrome.\n\n256\n00:13:41.490 --> 00:13:44.620\nSo you have to load that up,\nmake sure that it's the right version.\n\n257\n00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:46.090\nAnd now if you do make it to there,\n\n258\n00:13:46.090 --> 00:13:48.940\nit's just gonna tell you that\nit's no longer, all right?\n\n259\n00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:52.130\nSo this is the new way\nwe work with Intune.\n\n260\n00:13:53.510 --> 00:13:58.310\nAll right, and now let's start by taking\na look, we'll look at device enrollment in\n\n261\n00:13:58.310 --> 00:14:04.090\na later episode, they specifically call\nout those on the objectives later on.\n\n262\n00:14:04.090 --> 00:14:06.800\nSo right now we're going to stick with\nour current objective, supporting mobile\n\n263\n00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:11.880\ndevice policies including security\npolicies remote access and remote wipe.\n\n264\n00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:13.690\nSo that's what we're\ngonna focus in on here.\n\n265\n00:14:13.690 --> 00:14:15.920\nBut don't worry we will\ncircle back around.\n\n266\n00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:20.090\nAnd take a closer look at the enrollment\nprocess because it is something we've\n\n267\n00:14:20.090 --> 00:14:21.130\ngot to look at.\n\n268\n00:14:21.130 --> 00:14:24.460\nWhen we talk about enrollment and\nthe ability to support\n\n269\n00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:27.990\nthese different platforms,\nwe have to set up Apple enrollment.\n\n270\n00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:29.440\nWe have to set up Android enrollment.\n\n271\n00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:33.040\nWe configure Windows enrollment,\nand there's different options for\n\n272\n00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:33.720\neach one of those.\n\n273\n00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:36.410\nSo we will take a closer look at that.\n\n274\n00:14:36.410 --> 00:14:39.152\nRight now, we're going to stick\nwith some of our policies.\n\n275\n00:14:39.152 --> 00:14:43.582\nI'm gonna start with this first one\non the list here which is our device\n\n276\n00:14:43.582 --> 00:14:44.297\ncompliance, right.\n\n277\n00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:48.150\nActually before I do that,let's\nclick on devices and\n\n278\n00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:50.410\nmake sure our client is showing up.\n\n279\n00:14:50.410 --> 00:14:53.980\nI clicked on devices and\nthen I'm going to click all devices.\n\n280\n00:14:55.490 --> 00:14:58.110\nAnd there is that machine\nthat we were just looking at,\n\n281\n00:14:58.110 --> 00:15:00.810\nthat I was just logged in\nas Cherokee Client 01.\n\n282\n00:15:00.810 --> 00:15:02.830\nI can see it's managed by MDM,\n\n283\n00:15:02.830 --> 00:15:07.380\na mobile device manager,\nmanagement in this case, Microsoft Intune.\n\n284\n00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:08.960\nOwnership is listed as personal.\n\n285\n00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:11.860\nIt also shows as compliant.\n\n286\n00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:18.160\nI get my operating system, the OS version,\nno email address associated with that.\n\n287\n00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:21.390\nAnd if I click on that device,\nI can get even more information.\n\n288\n00:15:21.390 --> 00:15:22.644\nWe'll come back and\n\n289\n00:15:22.644 --> 00:15:27.380\nwe'll talk about some of these options\nup here in just a minute, all right?\n\n290\n00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:30.243\nThat's just showing you and\nthat's retrieving that information from\n\n291\n00:15:30.243 --> 00:15:33.206\nthe client, it's making it all available\nto me here through the portal.\n\n292\n00:15:33.206 --> 00:15:36.000\nAnd even if this wasn't like,\na domain member,\n\n293\n00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.667\nif it was just a laptop\nthat the user was using.\n\n294\n00:15:38.667 --> 00:15:41.152\nI could retrieve that information and\nI can see holy smokes,\n\n295\n00:15:41.152 --> 00:15:43.600\nthey haven't updated their\noperating system in how long?\n\n296\n00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:46.170\nOr they're running\nthe wrong version of this,\n\n297\n00:15:46.170 --> 00:15:48.236\nwe can mange all of that through here.\n\n298\n00:15:48.236 --> 00:15:49.959\nAll right, so back out to Intune and\n\n299\n00:15:49.959 --> 00:15:52.724\nthe first one I wanna take\na look at is Device Compliance.\n\n300\n00:15:52.724 --> 00:15:55.089\nSo I'm simply gonna click on that.\n\n301\n00:15:55.089 --> 00:15:58.030\nAnd the way these work\nis you create policies.\n\n302\n00:15:58.030 --> 00:16:00.999\nAnd policies are just\ncollections of settings, right?\n\n303\n00:16:00.999 --> 00:16:02.246\nJust like a group policy right?\n\n304\n00:16:02.246 --> 00:16:06.136\nThere's thousands of settings in a group\npolicy, I can configure which ones I want,\n\n305\n00:16:06.136 --> 00:16:08.170\nand then I can apply those policies.\n\n306\n00:16:08.170 --> 00:16:09.810\nSo the same concept is working here.\n\n307\n00:16:09.810 --> 00:16:14.160\nWe're gonna create policies, we'll\nconfigure settings within those policies,\n\n308\n00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:15.830\nand then we'll assign those policies.\n\n309\n00:16:15.830 --> 00:16:18.250\nAnd then they'll be applied automatically\n\n310\n00:16:18.250 --> 00:16:21.300\nusing this infrastructure.\n&gt;&gt; Now, I know you've said that we don't\n\n311\n00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:23.090\nhave those templates anymore, right?\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n312\n00:16:23.090 --> 00:16:25.020\n&gt;&gt; So in that show,\n\n313\n00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:30.460\nthe episode where you showed us\nhow to work with the deep linking,\n\n314\n00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:31.620\nI had to think about that for a second.\n\n315\n00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:33.200\nThe deep linking, and\n\n316\n00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:38.290\ngetting our apps ready, it was kind of\nlike fields and it had that red asterisk.\n\n317\n00:16:38.290 --> 00:16:41.880\nSo did we get some guidance here also?\n&gt;&gt; We do, absolutely.\n\n318\n00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:43.910\nAnd let's make sure we're clear on that,\nso\n\n319\n00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:45.639\nit's not, and let's just look at one.\n&gt;&gt; Okay\n\n320\n00:16:45.639 --> 00:16:47.199\n&gt;&gt; Right, and I think that will probably\n\n321\n00:16:47.199 --> 00:16:49.638\nanswer your question here Cherokee,\nif I click policies,\n\n322\n00:16:49.638 --> 00:16:51.320\nI'll see that I have one setup already.\n\n323\n00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:54.090\nThis is the one I, again,\nI wanted to make sure\n\n324\n00:16:54.090 --> 00:16:57.660\nthese policies had enough time to\nhopefully kick in for our episode.\n\n325\n00:16:57.660 --> 00:16:59.520\nBut lets create a policy,\n\n326\n00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:02.210\ncause when you first come in here,\nyou're gonna see nothing, right?\n\n327\n00:17:02.210 --> 00:17:04.440\nThere's no default policies, no templates.\n\n328\n00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:08.590\nIf I click Create Policy, and\njust like Cherokee was asking,\n\n329\n00:17:08.590 --> 00:17:13.450\nthere are fields here that I can\nfill in as I create this policy.\n\n330\n00:17:13.450 --> 00:17:17.960\nAnd so maybe, and make sure I was clear,\nwhen I say there's no templates,\n\n331\n00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:19.760\nthere's no predefined policies.\n\n332\n00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:21.260\nThe settings are already configured.\n\n333\n00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:25.550\nLike a best practices template, like these\nare the settings you should apply to most\n\n334\n00:17:25.550 --> 00:17:28.150\nWindows devices,\nthey don't tell you that anymore.\n\n335\n00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:31.810\nThey're used to be in the old Intune,\nhey, here's a policy.\n\n336\n00:17:31.810 --> 00:17:33.360\nIf you don't know what you're doing,\n\n337\n00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:37.570\nif you're new to this, here's a standard\npolicy that most people can use.\n\n338\n00:17:37.570 --> 00:17:41.290\nIt's already got settings in it,\nand you can just apply it, right?\n\n339\n00:17:41.290 --> 00:17:42.539\nNow they're like, no,\n\n340\n00:17:42.539 --> 00:17:45.749\nwe'll give you a list of all\nthe settings you can configure, but\n\n341\n00:17:45.749 --> 00:17:47.881\nwe're not gonna set any of them for you.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n342\n00:17:47.881 --> 00:17:50.550\n&gt;&gt; It's up to you to create the policy.\n\n343\n00:17:50.550 --> 00:17:57.350\nSo let's call this one our demo policy,\nright?\n\n344\n00:17:57.350 --> 00:18:01.470\nAnd sometimes,\nthe description field is required.\n\n345\n00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:02.214\nSometimes, it's not.\n\n346\n00:18:02.214 --> 00:18:04.560\nIt's not real consistent in here.\n\n347\n00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:06.000\nHere, I can see a green check mark and\n\n348\n00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.610\nno red asterisk,\nmeaning my description is not required.\n\n349\n00:18:09.610 --> 00:18:11.998\nAnd I'll say this is our up,\nand I'll put one in there.\n\n350\n00:18:11.998 --> 00:18:16.270\nEpisode Demo, right?\n\n351\n00:18:16.270 --> 00:18:18.450\nBut here, Platform is required.\n\n352\n00:18:19.528 --> 00:18:23.380\nAnd I wanna zoom in on this so we can,\nwhoa let's try that again, let's hit that\n\n353\n00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:29.482\ndrop down list first and see if I can zoom\nin without the crazy video going on there.\n\n354\n00:18:29.482 --> 00:18:32.230\nAll right, so look at that list,\nselect a platform, and\n\n355\n00:18:32.230 --> 00:18:37.590\nyou see things like Android,\niOS, Mac OS, Windows phone,\n\n356\n00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:42.270\neight one and later, ten and later as far\nas Windows Desktop operating systems go.\n\n357\n00:18:42.270 --> 00:18:45.710\nWell, I shouldn't say desktop,\nit's just Windows operating systems.\n\n358\n00:18:45.710 --> 00:18:48.910\nAnd you simply select\nthe platform that you want.\n\n359\n00:18:48.910 --> 00:18:50.032\nSo I'll start with a Windows 10.\n\n360\n00:18:50.032 --> 00:18:54.630\nAnd we'll zoom back out cuz of that\ncrazy video effect we're getting there.\n\n361\n00:18:54.630 --> 00:18:56.060\nAnd so I've got my name.\n\n362\n00:18:56.060 --> 00:18:57.620\nI've got my description.\n\n363\n00:18:57.620 --> 00:18:58.960\nI picked my platform.\n\n364\n00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:04.175\nAnd notice it slid over and another\nblade has shown up on my screen here.\n\n365\n00:19:04.175 --> 00:19:07.971\nNow, below where I chose the platform,\nI see settings and actions for\n\n366\n00:19:07.971 --> 00:19:09.073\nnon-compliance.\n\n367\n00:19:09.073 --> 00:19:14.334\nSettings is actually already selected and\nthat's why this pane is here.\n\n368\n00:19:14.334 --> 00:19:16.862\nAnd if I click on it,\nit's not gonna do anything.\n\n369\n00:19:16.862 --> 00:19:19.360\nUnderneath configure settings.\n\n370\n00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:24.780\nI have what looks to be three categories,\nand I'll zoom in here again,\n\n371\n00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:28.470\nexcuse the warping of the side of\nthe screen there if it does it.\n\n372\n00:19:28.470 --> 00:19:32.360\nBut you can see device health, four\nsettings available, device properties,\n\n373\n00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:36.810\nfive settings available,\nsystem security, 14 settings available.\n\n374\n00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:42.200\nAnd if I click on device health,\nit'll slide over even further and\n\n375\n00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:44.670\nI can see those four settings\nthat I have available.\n\n376\n00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:49.480\nAll right, require bit locker,\nrequire, sorry.\n\n377\n00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:53.100\nRequire secure boot,\nrequire code integrity,\n\n378\n00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:57.230\nrequire the device to be at or\nunder the device threat level.\n\n379\n00:19:57.230 --> 00:19:58.860\nAnd it's not configured.\n\n380\n00:19:58.860 --> 00:20:01.950\nWhat these settings are is\nnot important for this exam.\n\n381\n00:20:01.950 --> 00:20:05.500\nI don't want you to come in here and\ntrying to memorize\n\n382\n00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:09.370\nall of the settings that are available\non each one of these policies.\n\n383\n00:20:09.370 --> 00:20:11.550\nThat's not gonna help you pass the exam.\n\n384\n00:20:11.550 --> 00:20:12.610\nWhat you're gonna need to understand for\n\n385\n00:20:12.610 --> 00:20:16.620\nthe exam is what I can manage,\nwhat I can do, right?\n\n386\n00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:19.630\nUnderstanding that I can\ncreate a compliance policy\n\n387\n00:20:19.630 --> 00:20:23.580\nbased on Windows 10 devices and there is\na lot of options that I can configure,\n\n388\n00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:27.110\nnot as many as in group policy,\nbut many, right.\n\n389\n00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:29.860\nAnd so just to understanding this\nprocess of going through and\n\n390\n00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:32.790\ncreating these types of policies.\n\n391\n00:20:32.790 --> 00:20:35.720\nSo if I wanted to turn one of\nthese on I can simply select it,\n\n392\n00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:38.080\nI'm not going to in this particular case.\n\n393\n00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:42.870\nI'm gonna choose the next category device\nproperties, there's five settings here.\n\n394\n00:20:42.870 --> 00:20:46.340\nYou can set up a minimum operating\nsystem version, a maximum.\n\n395\n00:20:47.450 --> 00:20:52.530\nMinimum for mobile devices, maximum for\nmobile devices, operating system builds,\n\n396\n00:20:52.530 --> 00:20:57.100\nmay be you wanna prevent anybody from\nconnecting to your network with a,\n\n397\n00:20:59.210 --> 00:21:01.920\nwhat's it called now,\nwith the Insider Preview type thing.\n\n398\n00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:06.346\nOne of these brand new rollouts of Windows\n10 that really hasn't been run through its\n\n399\n00:21:06.346 --> 00:21:09.316\npaces yet, and\nwe don't know if there's any new security\n\n400\n00:21:09.316 --> 00:21:12.004\nvulnerabilities that might\nbe associated with it.\n\n401\n00:21:12.004 --> 00:21:14.905\nOr you wanna make sure nobody's\nrunning an iOS, in this case or\n\n402\n00:21:14.905 --> 00:21:15.780\nWindows-\n&gt;&gt; That's so\n\n403\n00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:18.690\nold it's not supported anymore?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, or it's not being updated\n\n404\n00:21:18.690 --> 00:21:24.220\nanymore, Or there's known security\nflaws with a particular version.\n\n405\n00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:27.610\nAnd so if they haven't upgraded that\nversion, applied those updates,\n\n406\n00:21:27.610 --> 00:21:28.930\nI don't want that device connecting.\n\n407\n00:21:28.930 --> 00:21:31.240\nSo that's the idea here.\n\n408\n00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:36.250\nDevice Properties, Device Health, and\nthen Systems Security has 14 settings.\n\n409\n00:21:36.250 --> 00:21:38.748\nAgain, we don't have to go\nthrough all of these, but\n\n410\n00:21:38.748 --> 00:21:42.037\nyou can see things like Password setting,\nminimum password length.\n\n411\n00:21:42.037 --> 00:21:45.244\nA lot of this were things we would\nnormally do through policy, right?\n\n412\n00:21:45.244 --> 00:21:47.139\nAnd you're thinking well,\nwhy have them here?\n\n413\n00:21:47.139 --> 00:21:51.076\nBecause this might not be a domain member.\n\n414\n00:21:51.076 --> 00:21:53.229\nIt's not getting group policy, okay.\n\n415\n00:21:53.229 --> 00:21:55.800\nSo this is how I start\ncontrolling some of those.\n\n416\n00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:59.480\nYes, I wanna let you connect\nwith your laptop from home.\n\n417\n00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:02.168\nBut I also wanna make sure you've\ngot a password configured and\n\n418\n00:22:02.168 --> 00:22:03.345\nthat it's not ABC123.\n\n419\n00:22:03.345 --> 00:22:06.939\nRight, because you're connecting\nto corporate resources and\n\n420\n00:22:06.939 --> 00:22:09.410\nsomebody could gain access to your laptop.\n\n421\n00:22:09.410 --> 00:22:12.670\nYou might leave your laptop at\na friend's house or in a cab and\n\n422\n00:22:12.670 --> 00:22:15.250\nwe don't need that risk, right.\n\n423\n00:22:15.250 --> 00:22:17.310\nSo lots of options here as well.\n\n424\n00:22:19.190 --> 00:22:22.130\nWindows defender, firewall settings,\n\n425\n00:22:22.130 --> 00:22:26.660\nin this case you just require that\na firewall is turned on, for example.\n\n426\n00:22:26.660 --> 00:22:30.850\nOr that windows defender is\ndoing real-time protection,\n\n427\n00:22:30.850 --> 00:22:34.760\nbecause I don't want someone turning\noff that real-time protection and\n\n428\n00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:38.920\nthen connecting to my network, right.\n&gt;&gt; It is really cool when you see,\n\n429\n00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:43.640\nyou said you were doing this for\nwhile and I definitely remember utilizing\n\n430\n00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:48.660\nthird party anti-malware,\nanti-viral type of software and\n\n431\n00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:54.540\nthey had management systems you could\ngo ahead and setup and monitor systems.\n\n432\n00:22:54.540 --> 00:22:57.090\nBut this is all, like it's comprehensive.\n\n433\n00:22:57.090 --> 00:22:58.280\nIt's within Windows 10.\n\n434\n00:22:58.280 --> 00:23:02.640\nYou don't have to have all these\nextra bolt-on capabilities.\n\n435\n00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:04.440\nIt's just all together.\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely,\n\n436\n00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:05.990\nand not just Windows 10, right?\n\n437\n00:23:05.990 --> 00:23:06.980\nOther platforms as well.\n\n438\n00:23:06.980 --> 00:23:08.330\nIn fact, let's take a look at that.\n\n439\n00:23:08.330 --> 00:23:13.080\nI'll go ahead and click OK and\nI'll kinda click OK all the way back out.\n\n440\n00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:16.710\nThere is, for actions for non-compliance.\n\n441\n00:23:16.710 --> 00:23:19.950\nMark device is non-compliant\nis the default action.\n\n442\n00:23:19.950 --> 00:23:22.470\nYou can additional actions like and\n\n443\n00:23:22.470 --> 00:23:26.970\nthe only one that's available currently\nis send an email to the end user.\n\n444\n00:23:26.970 --> 00:23:30.286\nAnd you might wanna set that up\nyou can create a bulleted or\n\n445\n00:23:30.286 --> 00:23:32.990\nwhat they call a boiler plate type email.\n\n446\n00:23:32.990 --> 00:23:35.500\nSay hey, your device is out of compliance.\n\n447\n00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:39.830\nSo look live man or do whatever it is you\nneed to do to get back into compliance.\n\n448\n00:23:39.830 --> 00:23:43.550\nSo go and click Create,\nit'll save that policy.\n\n449\n00:23:43.550 --> 00:23:45.733\nBut just like we saw the other day,\n\n450\n00:23:45.733 --> 00:23:50.789\nonce you saturate the policy you still\nneed to assign this to at least one group.\n\n451\n00:23:50.789 --> 00:23:53.619\nOtherwise, it's really not\naffecting anybody, and\n\n452\n00:23:53.619 --> 00:23:56.605\nthat's a normal part of\nthe development cycle, right?\n\n453\n00:23:56.605 --> 00:24:00.258\nFirst, we develop our policies,\nAnd then eventually we apply them.\n\n454\n00:24:00.258 --> 00:24:02.400\nWe might start with applying\nthem to a test group,\n\n455\n00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:05.980\nmake sure they're not going to cause any\nproblems, they do what we want them to do.\n\n456\n00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:11.490\nBut just keep in mind, and for the exam,\nif they are having you drag and drop steps\n\n457\n00:24:11.490 --> 00:24:15.025\nin the appropriate order, or anything\nlike that, don't forget this step.\n\n458\n00:24:15.025 --> 00:24:18.536\nCuz it's easy to go okay,\nI'm done, I created my policy, and\n\n459\n00:24:18.536 --> 00:24:22.713\njump all the way back out to InTune,\nand not read our little notification or\n\n460\n00:24:22.713 --> 00:24:25.855\nremember that we still have\nto assign this, all right?\n\n461\n00:24:25.855 --> 00:24:28.180\nSo we click on assignments.\n\n462\n00:24:28.180 --> 00:24:32.320\nAnd then, we select our\ngroups under Selected Groups.\n\n463\n00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:34.119\nAnd then, click here to select the groups.\n\n464\n00:24:36.300 --> 00:24:40.018\nAnd then, it should give me a list\nof the groups that I have available,\n\n465\n00:24:40.018 --> 00:24:41.740\nthat I can choose from.\n\n466\n00:24:41.740 --> 00:24:44.260\nI'll do those Windows 10 laptops.\n\n467\n00:24:44.260 --> 00:24:45.590\nI've got two host groups,\n\n468\n00:24:45.590 --> 00:24:50.141\none that I created in Azure,\none from my on-prem Active Directory.\n\n469\n00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:57.200\nI have seen some issues\napplying policies to devices.\n\n470\n00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:59.190\nIt's a little quirky still.\n\n471\n00:24:59.190 --> 00:25:01.560\nSo something to keep in mind.\n\n472\n00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:03.600\nAnd I'll go ahead and click Select.\n\n473\n00:25:05.010 --> 00:25:07.010\nAnd then, don't forget to click Save.\n\n474\n00:25:07.010 --> 00:25:09.400\nYou have the exclude capability as well.\n\n475\n00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:12.600\nYou might assign this to all users, and\n\n476\n00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:17.250\nthen exclude the C level execs,\nor something like that.\n\n477\n00:25:17.250 --> 00:25:18.370\nYou have that capability.\n\n478\n00:25:18.370 --> 00:25:19.680\nBut make sure you save it.\n\n479\n00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:23.090\nThey give you an evaluate button,\ntoo, where you can see, look,\n\n480\n00:25:23.090 --> 00:25:24.170\nit's gonna affect one device.\n\n481\n00:25:24.170 --> 00:25:26.800\nWell, that's cuz I only have\none device in that group,\n\n482\n00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:28.500\nso that's all it's saying there.\n\n483\n00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:31.820\nAll right, let me go ahead and,\n\n484\n00:25:31.820 --> 00:25:36.310\nactually while I'm here,\nlet me close out, all right?\n\n485\n00:25:36.310 --> 00:25:39.482\nSo now, if I go back into that\npolicy that we just created,\n\n486\n00:25:39.482 --> 00:25:41.480\nall right, my demo policy.\n\n487\n00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:44.900\nI get some information about it, and\nthis is where I was saying time, right?\n\n488\n00:25:44.900 --> 00:25:47.710\nYou see the one device\ndoesn't show up yet.\n\n489\n00:25:47.710 --> 00:25:50.700\nSometimes it will show up on one blade and\nnot another.\n\n490\n00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:54.020\nIt's just a timing thing,\nyou have to be patient with this.\n\n491\n00:25:54.020 --> 00:25:55.960\nBut this gives you a nice overview.\n\n492\n00:25:55.960 --> 00:26:00.190\nIf this had been up and running for\na few days, and I have multiple devices,\n\n493\n00:26:00.190 --> 00:26:06.030\nI would see what devices had succeeded or\nerrored, or had conflict, or are pending.\n\n494\n00:26:06.030 --> 00:26:07.816\nNice little summary view there.\n\n495\n00:26:07.816 --> 00:26:10.930\nI can always go back and\nmodify my assignments.\n\n496\n00:26:10.930 --> 00:26:15.890\nIf it's coming out of pilot and I wanna\napply these to all my other machines now,\n\n497\n00:26:15.890 --> 00:26:20.220\nyou've got monitoring nodes down\nhere I can check on device status,\n\n498\n00:26:21.310 --> 00:26:23.030\nall right, or user status.\n\n499\n00:26:23.030 --> 00:26:26.300\nAgain, not showing a whole lot\nbecause it really to hasn't\n\n500\n00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:30.430\nhad time to process the fact that there\nis a device that this applies to.\n\n501\n00:26:30.430 --> 00:26:33.830\nI go back to one of those other policies,\nwe might be able to see that.\n\n502\n00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:36.010\nLet's see, Policies.\n\n503\n00:26:36.010 --> 00:26:38.490\nTest Compliance policy\nis one I did earlier.\n\n504\n00:26:38.490 --> 00:26:41.890\nAnd here,\nyou can see a better shot of the device.\n\n505\n00:26:41.890 --> 00:26:43.375\nAnd this is drill down capable.\n\n506\n00:26:43.375 --> 00:26:47.160\nYou'll notice I get the little\nfinger icon or the hand icon, so\n\n507\n00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:48.720\nI can click on this and I can drill down.\n\n508\n00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:53.300\nIf there were errors, I could go and see\njust the ones that had those errors and\n\n509\n00:26:53.300 --> 00:26:53.980\nthings like that.\n\n510\n00:26:53.980 --> 00:26:55.085\nHere, I can see Client01.\n\n511\n00:26:55.085 --> 00:26:57.920\nThat deployment status is pending.\n\n512\n00:26:57.920 --> 00:27:00.310\nAnd that was since 1:59.\n\n513\n00:27:00.310 --> 00:27:03.290\nWhat else?\n\n514\n00:27:03.290 --> 00:27:04.200\nUser status.\n\n515\n00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:07.635\nSo you can go back in and\nmonitor those policies.\n\n516\n00:27:07.635 --> 00:27:10.802\nAll right, I know we're getting short\non time, so I wanna do one more thing.\n\n517\n00:27:10.802 --> 00:27:14.740\nWe're gonna go back into device\ncompliance, where we just were.\n\n518\n00:27:14.740 --> 00:27:16.480\nAnd we click Policies.\n\n519\n00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:18.920\nAnd I'm gonna create another policy,\nall right?\n\n520\n00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:20.720\nSo I'm doing this quick,\nwe've seen this part.\n\n521\n00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:23.546\nI'm gonna call this my iOS demo.\n\n522\n00:27:23.546 --> 00:27:26.355\nWhat did I do, capital the OS there?\n\n523\n00:27:26.355 --> 00:27:29.477\nDemo.\nI'm not gonna give it a description for\n\n524\n00:27:29.477 --> 00:27:33.550\nthe platform, I'm gonna choose iOS, right?\n\n525\n00:27:33.550 --> 00:27:35.810\nAnd now, you'll see the settings\nare much different.\n\n526\n00:27:35.810 --> 00:27:39.591\nI don't have the same options I did\nwith the Windows platform, right?\n\n527\n00:27:39.591 --> 00:27:41.620\nBut I can do e-mail settings.\n\n528\n00:27:41.620 --> 00:27:43.610\nI've got a couple of device health.\n\n529\n00:27:43.610 --> 00:27:47.843\nI want to make sure that jailbroke\ndevices don't connect, right?\n\n530\n00:27:47.843 --> 00:27:51.434\nBecause that means they have-\n&gt;&gt; Potential security risks\n\n531\n00:27:51.434 --> 00:27:53.651\n&gt;&gt; Yes, they've jailbroke their device so\n\n532\n00:27:53.651 --> 00:27:56.944\nthey can get access to resources\nthat haven't been vetted and\n\n533\n00:27:56.944 --> 00:27:59.750\ngone through the proper stores,\nthings like that.\n\n534\n00:27:59.750 --> 00:28:03.830\nRequire the device to be at or\nunder a particular device level.\n\n535\n00:28:03.830 --> 00:28:06.610\nYou see device properties, and yes,\nI'm gonna lose my changes there.\n\n536\n00:28:06.610 --> 00:28:08.890\nI'm not gonna save those, all right?\n\n537\n00:28:08.890 --> 00:28:09.487\nMinimum, maximum.\n\n538\n00:28:09.487 --> 00:28:12.880\nBut not nearly as many as I had for\nmy Windows.\n\n539\n00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:14.220\nSecurity settings.\n\n540\n00:28:14.220 --> 00:28:19.498\nI can require pin links,\npassword links for those devices.\n\n541\n00:28:19.498 --> 00:28:24.440\nAnd again, I'm not concerned with you\nmemorizing all the possible settings\n\n542\n00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:28.988\niOS versus Android, versus which\nones are available for Windows.\n\n543\n00:28:28.988 --> 00:28:33.120\nThey're not gonna test you\non memorizing all of those.\n\n544\n00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:36.110\nBut they will expect you to understand\n\n545\n00:28:36.110 --> 00:28:41.050\nthat I can create device\ncompliance policies for Android.\n\n546\n00:28:41.050 --> 00:28:42.450\nI can do it for Android for work.\n\n547\n00:28:42.450 --> 00:28:43.430\nI can do iOS.\n\n548\n00:28:43.430 --> 00:28:44.480\nI can do Mac OS.\n\n549\n00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:48.170\nI can Windows phone and\nWindows 8.1, and Windows 10.\n\n550\n00:28:48.170 --> 00:28:50.850\nThat's the kind of thing\nthey're gonna want you to know.\n\n551\n00:28:50.850 --> 00:28:55.170\nCan you manage that user's\ndevice if it's running iOS?\n\n552\n00:28:55.170 --> 00:28:57.800\nThe answer is absolutely, right?\n\n553\n00:28:57.800 --> 00:28:59.200\nBut I can't see them asking you.\n\n554\n00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:00.432\nAnd that's no guarantee.\n\n555\n00:29:00.432 --> 00:29:03.690\nI'm not telling you what is and\nisn't on the exam, right?\n\n556\n00:29:03.690 --> 00:29:07.360\nOne, I can't do that,\nI don't know that information.\n\n557\n00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:09.530\nSo I'm not gonna promise you that.\n\n558\n00:29:09.530 --> 00:29:12.980\nBut I'm saying, generally, they don't\nexpect you to memorize hundreds of\n\n559\n00:29:12.980 --> 00:29:15.860\nsettings just because\nthose settings change.\n\n560\n00:29:15.860 --> 00:29:20.620\nTomorrow we come in here and there could\nbe new settings available for iOS devices.\n\n561\n00:29:20.620 --> 00:29:23.430\nAs the vendors, as they work with Apple,\n\n562\n00:29:23.430 --> 00:29:26.770\nas they work with the other vendors,\nthey can make more and\n\n563\n00:29:26.770 --> 00:29:30.230\nmore settings available to manage\nthrough this mobile device management.\n\n564\n00:29:30.230 --> 00:29:33.160\nMicrosoft actually makes a really\ncool tool that'll allow you\n\n565\n00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:35.210\nto go through your group policies and\n\n566\n00:29:35.210 --> 00:29:40.010\nsee if the settings you're applying in\ngroup policy is available in Intune.\n\n567\n00:29:40.010 --> 00:29:43.580\nAnd it's pretty neat because they monitor\nthat, and they'll see what people\n\n568\n00:29:43.580 --> 00:29:46.950\nare looking to move to Intune,\nand they can add those settings.\n\n569\n00:29:46.950 --> 00:29:48.410\nSo pretty neat.\n\n570\n00:29:48.410 --> 00:29:50.360\nBut again, not exam worthy there, either.\n&gt;&gt; Mike,\n\n571\n00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:53.570\ndo you have any final thoughts or anything\nyou'd like to tell us here about our\n\n572\n00:29:53.570 --> 00:29:54.510\npolicies?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n573\n00:29:54.510 --> 00:29:56.530\nwe do have to go through a little more.\n\n574\n00:29:56.530 --> 00:29:59.510\nI wanna show you some\nmore options in there and\n\n575\n00:29:59.510 --> 00:30:00.730\nwhat we can do with those devices.\n\n576\n00:30:00.730 --> 00:30:01.720\nI know we're getting short on time, so\n\n577\n00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:02.970\nwe're gonna have to come back-\n&gt;&gt; For\n\n578\n00:30:02.970 --> 00:30:03.570\npart two.\n&gt;&gt; For\n\n579\n00:30:03.570 --> 00:30:04.240\nanother part, yeah.\n\n580\n00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:04.873\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Surprise,\n\n581\n00:30:04.873 --> 00:30:05.689\nsurprise, right?\n\n582\n00:30:05.689 -->

Mike.\n\n585\n00:30:08.530 --> 00:30:10.210\nThank you guys for joining us as well, but\n\n586\n00:30:10.210 --> 00:30:12.770\nyou don't wanna miss\nthat second part here.\n\n587\n00:30:12.770 --> 00:30:14.010\nFor now, let's sign out.\n\n588\n00:30:14.010 --> 00:30:16.490\nI've been your host, Cherokee Boose.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n589\n00:30:16.490 --> 00:30:17.510\n&gt;&gt; See you next time.\n\n590\n00:30:17.510 --> 00:30:19.582\nBye.\n[MUSIC]\n\n591\n00:30:19.582 --> 00:30:26.857\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPro.TV.\n\n",

00:00:08.060\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:12.562\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your\n\n5\n00:00:12.562 --> 00:00:18.200\nConfiguring Windows Devices series,\nstudying up for the 70-697 exam.\n\n6\n00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.220\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose and\nin this episode\n\n7\n00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:26.130\nwe'll continue looking at ways so we can\nactually be supporting our mobile devices.\n\n8\n00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.050\nAnd of course with us back in\nstudios we were able to get,\n\n9\n00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:32.910\nMike Rodrick to talk about this.\n&gt;&gt; I tried to leave they've got me\n\n10\n00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.290\nchained, what you can't see is I'm\nchained to the podium down here.\n\n11\n00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:39.660\nI'm kidding, of course I came back\nbecause I love talking about Windows 10.\n\n12\n00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.040\nAs you know because I've had what?\n\n13\n00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.972\nPart 4, part 5, part 7, I talk a lot, but\nanyway, we are gonna continue on with\n\n14\n00:00:45.972 --> 00:00:50.066\nour mobile device management and\nWindows 10 or Microsoft in Tune.\n\n15\n00:00:50.066 --> 00:00:54.131\nAnd so let's just jump right back into it,\nwe've got a lot of the foundation work and\n\n16\n00:00:54.131 --> 00:00:55.940\nthe concepts already covered.\n\n17\n00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.516\nWe left off,\nwe had created a device compliance policy.\n\n18\n00:00:59.516 --> 00:01:03.468\nI wanna show you a couple of the other\npolicies just so you're, again, for\n\n19\n00:01:03.468 --> 00:01:08.200\nthis exam, aware of what we can do with\nIntune in our mobile device management.\n\n20\n00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.910\nSo compliance you saw\nthe settings in there and\n\n21\n00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:13.790\nthat's really what I want you to\nthink about as you're studying.\n\n22\n00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.788\nI'm gonna jump back in to one of these\ncompliance polices that we just created.\n\n23\n00:01:18.788 --> 00:01:21.430\nAnd we're gonna take a look at these\nproperties, cuz you can always go back and\n\n24\n00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:22.570\nedit these properties.\n\n25\n00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.790\nYou saw me click on the policy and\nthen go the properties and\n\n26\n00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:30.144\nhere's those same settings that I looked\nat when we were creating the policy.\n\n27\n00:01:30.144 --> 00:01:34.273\nOops, this was the IOS one, so there\nis not a whole lot of settings there.\n\n28\n00:01:34.273 --> 00:01:36.873\nNo that wasn't, that was a windows 10 one,\n\n29\n00:01:36.873 --> 00:01:41.152\nthree settings configured out of\nthe mired of settings available, right.\n\n30\n00:01:41.152 --> 00:01:45.571\nSo I can go back and change those,\nalright, but actually what I went in here\n\n31\n00:01:45.571 --> 00:01:49.289\nto show you, was the settings\nwere things like device health,\n\n32\n00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:52.220\ndevice properties and system security.\n\n33\n00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.850\nThose are our compliance policies and\nthat's what you need to think about,\n\n34\n00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.680\nif I wanted to find a setting that deals\nwith windows defender and the firewall or\n\n35\n00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.900\npassword settings, those are gonna\nbe compliance policies, right?\n\n36\n00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.663\nLets jump out of this, all the way\nback into intune and the next one,\n\n37\n00:02:09.663 --> 00:02:12.902\ntake a look at device\nconfiguration policies, alright,\n\n38\n00:02:12.902 --> 00:02:17.745\nsame thing although here they call them\nprofiles, instead of policies terminology.\n\n39\n00:02:17.745 --> 00:02:21.537\nWe're gonna click on profiles and\nyou see I created one earlier, just so\n\n40\n00:02:21.537 --> 00:02:24.910\nwe'll have something to look at but\nlet's create another one.\n\n41\n00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:31.530\nAnd we'll call this one\nmy Demo Configuration or\n\n42\n00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:37.860\nConfig Profile and\nI can't spell profile, let's fix that.\n\n43\n00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.623\nDescription not required in this case,\nPlatform is gonna be required,\n\n44\n00:02:43.623 --> 00:02:47.528\nsame options here and we'll go with\nWindows 10 for my platform and\n\n45\n00:02:47.528 --> 00:02:50.765\nthen profile type and\nyou can see I have a drop down list.\n\n46\n00:02:50.765 --> 00:02:57.010\nIt says select configuration and let\nme zoom in on that for us a little bit.\n\n47\n00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.000\nGotta get rid of some\nof that funkiness and\n\n48\n00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.560\nyou can see different\nconfigurations that are available.\n\n49\n00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.870\nDevice restrictions, addition upgrade,\nemail Implant protection,\n\n50\n00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.750\nnetwork bounty,\ncertificates of several types, a VPN and\n\n51\n00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.090\nif I scroll down a little\nbit Windows Defender,\n\n52\n00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.460\nEducation Profile, custom, so\nlet's click on one of those.\n\n53\n00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:21.606\nLet's pick something like VPN, alright and\n\n54\n00:03:21.606 --> 00:03:25.750\nlet me zoom out to get rid of that\ncrazy screen thing going on there.\n\n55\n00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:29.209\nSo profile type, I pick VPN and\nin settings configure and\n\n56\n00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:32.825\nthen here is the different\nsettings that I have available.\n\n57\n00:03:32.825 --> 00:03:37.585\nLet me see base VPN, Seven settings, there\nis also is an asterisk, next to this one.\n\n58\n00:03:37.585 --> 00:03:42.513\nMeaning of I've gotta configure something\nin here is going to be required,\n\n59\n00:03:42.513 --> 00:03:47.364\nwe click on that, we can see the\nconnection name is gonna be required so\n\n60\n00:03:47.364 --> 00:03:51.820\nI'll call this my demo VPN maybe or\nsomething like that.\n\n61\n00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:58.180\nServers, I can type in IP address,\ndescription, that kind of thing.\n\n62\n00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:02.630\nThis is default server, I can add, I can\nadd multiples, in fact, let's make one up.\n\n63\n00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:07.192\nWe'll call this, the name of my\ndomain is ITProTV demo, so I'm gonna\n\n64\n00:04:07.192 --> 00:04:12.310\nsay demo VPN server for that.\n\n65\n00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:16.314\nMaybe its address was 10.0.100.\n\n66\n00:04:16.314 --> 00:04:20.472\nCheck that num lock,\n10.0 Pulling hundred, 101 or\n\n67\n00:04:20.472 --> 00:04:23.250\nsomething like that.\n&gt;&gt; Every time, you think you just,\n\n68\n00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:26.400\nyou got it all, you typed it super\nfast and looked down and nothing.\n\n69\n00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.926\n&gt;&gt; I know, I know.\n\n70\n00:04:27.926 --> 00:04:31.247\nAs is the default server it is and\nthen I click add and\n\n71\n00:04:31.247 --> 00:04:33.340\nthere's it adds it to the list.\n\n72\n00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:37.760\nBut I can add more than one at a back-up\nserver if this one wasn't available,\n\n73\n00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:39.490\nwhich one that they connect to.\n\n74\n00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:44.000\nConnection type, I can hit,\nall we gonna do else with TP may be or\n\n75\n00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.540\nmay be this one is more of,\nwe can set it to IP2 and\n\n76\n00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:53.040\ndepending on what you select, that\nmight change the information down here.\n\n77\n00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:57.511\nRight while authentication certificate for\nIP2, but if I go to EPTP,\n\n78\n00:04:57.511 --> 00:04:58.710\nI don't see that.\n\n79\n00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:01.370\nWell, I do see authentication\ncertificate for that as well.\n\n80\n00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:03.540\nSo it depends on what they've\nset up on the other end, too.\n\n81\n00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:06.910\nIs it requiring certificates for\nauthentication?\n\n82\n00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:08.946\nAgain, I know I've said this before,\n\n83\n00:05:08.946 --> 00:05:13.276\non the exam they're not expecting you to\nmemorize every possible setting in here.\n\n84\n00:05:13.276 --> 00:05:18.261\nIt's more about understanding that\nconfiguration profiles allow me to\n\n85\n00:05:18.261 --> 00:05:22.720\nconfigure certain things on those devices,\nlike VPNs in this case.\n\n86\n00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:25.940\nAnd that's one that's always, we've had\ndifferent ways of pushing out VPNs.\n\n87\n00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:29.710\nIf you've ever tried to help a user,\nwalk them through the process of\n\n88\n00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:34.780\ncreating a VPN connection over the phone,\nIt can be challenging,\n\n89\n00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:38.580\nlet's just say, it can test your patience.\n&gt;&gt; Well, that's why a lot of times\n\n90\n00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:43.560\nback in the day, you would literally\nprovision and set up a laptop and\n\n91\n00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:46.250\nput it in snail mail to your end user.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah,\n\n92\n00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:47.370\nexactly.\n&gt;&gt; Really.\n\n93\n00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:49.844\n&gt;&gt; But now I can use policies, right,\n\n94\n00:05:49.844 --> 00:05:54.710\nI can configure it once here and\nI can assign it to a group of laptops or,\n\n95\n00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:58.610\nall the sales users laptops or\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n96\n00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:01.855\nAnd they don't have to come by,\nthey can just be done automatically,\n\n97\n00:06:01.855 --> 00:06:04.130\nIt has all the right information in there.\n\n98\n00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:06.660\nThere's no extra calls to the help desk,\nwhat did I do wrong?\n\n99\n00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:10.091\nThey just pull down this profile,\nright and\n\n100\n00:06:10.091 --> 00:06:13.020\nyou can see other things related to VPN.\n\n101\n00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:16.900\nLike a not important the specifics\nof the settings, but\n\n102\n00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:22.120\nwe can create those VPN profiles and push\nthose out through, I'm not gonna actually.\n\n103\n00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:24.092\nWell, I'll go ahead and\ncreate it, what the heck.\n\n104\n00:06:24.092 --> 00:06:29.324\nWe'll click create and yeah, I didn't\nput in all the required information,\n\n105\n00:06:29.324 --> 00:06:31.870\nso it's not gonna let me create that.\n\n106\n00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:36.680\nI'll go ahead and cancel that out, so\nagain, if I click create a profile,\n\n107\n00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:39.510\nI wanna show you that\nprofile type one more time.\n\n108\n00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:44.180\nLet's go it iOS this time and hit that\ndrop down list and you'll see I have\n\n109\n00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:51.540\nmostly the same options, device features,\nwe change that to Android.\n\n110\n00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:55.790\nI get not exactly the same, right,\nthat list is slightly different and again,\n\n111\n00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:56.940\nthat's what it's all about here,\n\n112\n00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:00.790\nis understanding that not everything\ncan be done to every single device.\n\n113\n00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:03.580\nThey're not all the same,\nthey don't have the same options.\n\n114\n00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:06.520\nThe vendors have made\ncertain settings available,\n\n115\n00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:10.530\nto work by through Intune and\nthis stuff changes as well.\n\n116\n00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:13.530\nNext week,\nthis list might look different, right?\n\n117\n00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:14.570\nSo that's why I say and\n\n118\n00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:17.490\nI know we keep saying this That-\n&gt;&gt; Don't stress the details here?\n\n119\n00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:18.750\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly,\n\n120\n00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:23.710\nbecause they can't, I hope, that they\nwon't try to test you on something\n\n121\n00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:25.220\nthat changes from week to week, right?\n\n122\n00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:28.530\nThey don't update the exam\nthat often first of all, so\n\n123\n00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:31.860\ndon't sweat those kind of\ndetails at this point.\n\n124\n00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:35.730\nJust play, get in here, look and see all\nthe different things that you can do,\n\n125\n00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:36.520\nall right?\n\n126\n00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:41.510\nLet's see, so I created that test\nconfiguration profile just a second ago.\n\n127\n00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:45.246\nSame thing as the other profiles and\npolicies we've worked with,\n\n128\n00:07:45.246 --> 00:07:47.324\nyou do have to assign it, all right?\n\n129\n00:07:47.324 --> 00:07:52.567\nThis one actually, this is the one I\ncreated earlier, yeah I did assign it,\n\n130\n00:07:52.567 --> 00:07:56.460\nbut don't forget to click assignments,\npick the group,\n\n131\n00:07:56.460 --> 00:08:01.316\neither devices or users, that you're\ngoing to assign that to, right?\n\n132\n00:08:01.316 --> 00:08:05.810\nAll right, let's see what else we wanna\ntake a look at here before we move on.\n\n133\n00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:08.390\nAs we talked about,\nthere are compliance policies,\n\n134\n00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:11.330\nthere are configuration policies,\nand understanding the difference.\n\n135\n00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:14.000\nCompliance is more about\nsecurity settings,\n\n136\n00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.690\nmaking sure we're compliant with\nour corporate security policies.\n\n137\n00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:19.730\nFirewalls are on, passwords are changing,\n\n138\n00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:24.140\nthey're a certain length,\nantivirus is up to date, things like that.\n\n139\n00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:27.850\nConfiguration is more about,\nlet me set up their email client for them,\n\n140\n00:08:27.850 --> 00:08:32.700\nlet me set up a VPN connection for\nthem, things like that, all right?\n\n141\n00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:36.970\nWe scroll down a little bit,\nthey have conditional access policies.\n\n142\n00:08:36.970 --> 00:08:42.860\nAnd these are policies where I can control\naccess based on certain conditions.\n\n143\n00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:44.600\nHence the name [LAUGH] conditional access.\n\n144\n00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:47.030\nAnd they give a great little example here.\n\n145\n00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:49.760\nThese are the ways you might\nuse conditional access.\n\n146\n00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:52.540\nWhen any user is outside\nof the company network,\n\n147\n00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:55.690\nthey're required to sign in with\nmultifactor authentication.\n\n148\n00:08:55.690 --> 00:09:00.380\nSo if you're in house, if you're on-prem,\nyou can log in with maybe your password.\n\n149\n00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:03.780\nBut if you're out at the hotel or\nthe airport and\n\n150\n00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:08.080\nyou try to connect, now you're gonna\nhave to use multifactor authentication.\n\n151\n00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:10.670\nOr when users in\nthe manager's group sign in,\n\n152\n00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:14.120\nthey are required to be on an Intune\ncompliant or domain joined device.\n\n153\n00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:18.577\nIf a manager tries to use his own personal\ndevice that's not domain joined or\n\n154\n00:09:18.577 --> 00:09:22.138\nregistered with Intune,\nthey're not allowed to connect.\n\n155\n00:09:22.138 --> 00:09:25.987\nBecause they have access to things that\nI don't need being exposed to a machine\n\n156\n00:09:25.987 --> 00:09:27.927\nthat's not under my control, right?\n\n157\n00:09:27.927 --> 00:09:32.670\nOr at least in compliance with all of our\npolicies as far as Intune is concerned.\n\n158\n00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:35.640\nSo that's the idea behind\nconditional access.\n\n159\n00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:39.230\nChanging what they can and\ncan't do based on certain conditions.\n\n160\n00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:43.560\nAnd it works the same way, you click New\nPolicy and you walk through and you pick.\n\n161\n00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:48.040\nYou give it a name, decide what users or\ngroups this is gonna apply to.\n\n162\n00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:50.706\nAnd then what the conditions are, and\n\n163\n00:09:50.706 --> 00:09:55.881\nwhat we're going to grant depending\non if that condition is met, right?\n\n164\n00:09:55.881 --> 00:09:56.969\nWe'll go ahead and close out of that.\n\n165\n00:09:56.969 --> 00:09:58.340\nI'm not gonna actually make any.\n\n166\n00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:01.830\nI just wanted to show you that option.\n\n167\n00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:06.340\nThere's another one for on-prem access,\nbut I don't have exchange connectors set\n\n168\n00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:09.175\nup, so I'm not gonna be\nable to configure that one.\n\n169\n00:10:09.175 --> 00:10:11.635\nWe'll close, jump back out of there.\n\n170\n00:10:11.635 --> 00:10:15.415\nSoftware updates and some of these others,\nthose are gonna come up in other episodes.\n\n171\n00:10:15.415 --> 00:10:17.655\nSo make sure you watch all of them.\n\n172\n00:10:17.655 --> 00:10:21.555\nBut that kinda gives us\na good idea of Intune.\n\n173\n00:10:21.555 --> 00:10:23.735\nNow, they do call out\na couple of other things.\n\n174\n00:10:23.735 --> 00:10:27.350\nIn the objectives,\nthey specifically say security policies.\n\n175\n00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:28.130\nRemember what I told you,\n\n176\n00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:31.600\nthere really aren't any built-in\nsecurity policies anymore.\n\n177\n00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:33.020\nAll these policies we've been looking at,\n\n178\n00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:37.400\nconfiguration policies, compliance\npolicies, those are the security policies.\n\n179\n00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:38.360\nAnd there's no templates.\n\n180\n00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:40.170\nYou have to configure them yourself.\n\n181\n00:10:40.170 --> 00:10:42.890\nThey also call out remote access and\nremote wipe.\n\n182\n00:10:42.890 --> 00:10:47.180\nAnd honestly, if I click on devices, and\n\n183\n00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:50.680\nwe click all devices, we've got that\nclient that's connected already.\n\n184\n00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:52.050\nYou saw us with that up.\n\n185\n00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:54.400\nI click client 01, all right,\n\n186\n00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:59.710\nright up here at the top of the details,\nI have remove company data, right?\n\n187\n00:10:59.710 --> 00:11:02.110\nThis is that remote wipe\nthey're talking about.\n\n188\n00:11:02.110 --> 00:11:06.850\nThis will allow me to wipe\nthe device not of everything.\n\n189\n00:11:06.850 --> 00:11:09.120\nKeep in mind,\nthese are not my devices anymore.\n\n190\n00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:12.560\nWe're talking about managing\nCherokee's personal laptop, or\n\n191\n00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:16.880\nan employee's iPad that they're using to\nconnect, or whatever the case may be.\n\n192\n00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:21.710\nAnd typically, I don't have the rights to\nwipe out all of their personal photos, and\n\n193\n00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:22.420\nthings like that.\n\n194\n00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:24.390\nI wouldn't wanna do that to my end users.\n\n195\n00:11:24.390 --> 00:11:29.088\nBut if that device has been compromised or\nif they've left the organization,\n\n196\n00:11:29.088 --> 00:11:31.807\nI need to be able to\nremove that company data.\n\n197\n00:11:31.807 --> 00:11:34.796\nOr if they tell me that\nthey've lost their device,\n\n198\n00:11:34.796 --> 00:11:37.375\nI wanna be able to remove\nthat company data.\n\n199\n00:11:37.375 --> 00:11:39.782\nBecause somebody might try\nto gain access to it and\n\n200\n00:11:39.782 --> 00:11:43.350\ngain access to company information\nthat they shouldn't have access to.\n\n201\n00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:47.350\nCan also do a factory\nreset on that device.\n\n202\n00:11:47.350 --> 00:11:49.730\nAnd this will again too\ndepend upon the device and\n\n203\n00:11:49.730 --> 00:11:53.220\nwhether or not the vendor is [INAUDIBLE],\nlike whether Apple has given Microsoft\n\n204\n00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:56.310\nthe ability to do factory\nresets through Intune.\n\n205\n00:11:56.310 --> 00:11:59.262\nYou can remove the device itself.\n\n206\n00:11:59.262 --> 00:12:03.500\nLet me to zoom out so\nthat video glitch stops there.\n\n207\n00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:08.215\nI can restart the device,\nFresh Start, Quick Scan, Full Scan,\n\n208\n00:12:08.215 --> 00:12:10.628\nwhen it comes to Windows Update.\n\n209\n00:12:10.628 --> 00:12:12.979\nI haven't configured\nthe remote assistance, but\n\n210\n00:12:12.979 --> 00:12:14.790\nthis is where I could do remote access.\n\n211\n00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:20.470\nAnd I could do Remote Assistance Session\nwith that user to help them, all right?\n\n212\n00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:21.905\nSo that is the idea here.\n\n213\n00:12:21.905 --> 00:12:25.289\nYou can go to Properties, and\nyou can see more information.\n\n214\n00:12:25.289 --> 00:12:28.090\nRemember when I said the device\nwas classified as personal?\n\n215\n00:12:28.090 --> 00:12:30.990\nIf that was actually a corporate device,\nwhich it is,\n\n216\n00:12:30.990 --> 00:12:33.961\nI can come in here and\nchange that to CORPORATE, right?\n\n217\n00:12:33.961 --> 00:12:36.969\nAnd it'll tell you that Itune\ncollects the phone number and\n\n218\n00:12:36.969 --> 00:12:41.572\n[INAUDIBLE] inventory of company owned\ndevices before I make any company device.\n\n219\n00:12:41.572 --> 00:12:45.541\nConfirm that the device is owned by the\ncompany, basically telling me, hey look,\n\n220\n00:12:45.541 --> 00:12:46.902\nif it's a personal device,\n\n221\n00:12:46.902 --> 00:12:50.610\ndon't change this to corporate just\nbecause you want it labeled corporate.\n\n222\n00:12:50.610 --> 00:12:54.340\nBecause once you change it to corporate,\nit changes what Intune does to the device.\n\n223\n00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:58.420\nAnd you could be violating personal\nrights, privacy, things like that by\n\n224\n00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:02.450\njust changing this to corporate on\nsomebody's actual personal device.\n\n225\n00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:06.150\nAll right, let's close out of that.\n\n226\n00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:07.820\nAnd let's see what else we wanna do.\n\n227\n00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:10.360\nI think that takes care\nof most of the policies.\n\n228\n00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:11.740\nWe've seen a device connect.\n\n229\n00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:15.180\nI did want to try connecting\na personal device, right?\n\n230\n00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:16.850\nThe one we looked at,\n\n231\n00:13:16.850 --> 00:13:21.270\nthis one here that Cherokee was logged\ninto, this was a corporate device.\n\n232\n00:13:21.270 --> 00:13:23.650\nIt's a member of the domain.\n\n233\n00:13:23.650 --> 00:13:27.720\nAnd I also have a home machine here,\nand let's see if we can connect that.\n\n234\n00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:31.940\nI'm logged in as I think Nate,\nbut the system doesn't know.\n\n235\n00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:32.930\nWe're gonna lie to it.\n\n236\n00:13:32.930 --> 00:13:36.630\nAll right, same process that I went\nthrough on the corporate device.\n\n237\n00:13:36.630 --> 00:13:43.050\nI'm gonna go to Accounts and then\nAccess work or school and then Connect.\n\n238\n00:13:44.210 --> 00:13:46.914\nSame dialog opens up.\n\n239\n00:13:46.914 --> 00:13:54.552\nI'll type in cherokee@itprotvdemo.com.\n\n240\n00:13:58.048 --> 00:14:02.397\nAnd I'll authenticate with that super\ncomplex password Cherokee uses.\n\n241\n00:14:02.397 --> 00:14:04.401\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n242\n00:14:04.401 --> 00:14:05.041\n&gt;&gt; And we'll give it a second.\n\n243\n00:14:05.041 --> 00:14:05.600\n&gt;&gt; You know it.\n\n244\n00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:06.209\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And\n\n245\n00:14:06.209 --> 00:14:10.698\nit tells me to hold on while we register\nthe device with your company and\n\n246\n00:14:10.698 --> 00:14:11.696\napply policy.\n\n247\n00:14:11.696 --> 00:14:13.145\nIt might take it a moment.\n\n248\n00:14:13.145 --> 00:14:14.330\nIt's reaching out.\n\n249\n00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:16.694\nIt's verifying that\nCherokee's a valid user and\n\n250\n00:14:16.694 --> 00:14:18.501\nthat it's put in the right password.\n\n251\n00:14:18.501 --> 00:14:21.681\nAnd then it tells me your admin has\nrequired that you set up this account for\n\n252\n00:14:21.681 --> 00:14:23.333\nadditional security verfiication.\n\n253\n00:14:23.333 --> 00:14:24.764\nI'll click Setup now.\n\n254\n00:14:24.764 --> 00:14:29.340\nThis is more on the Azure side of things,\ndealing with multifactor authentication.\n\n255\n00:14:31.310 --> 00:14:31.950\nThis'll be fun.\n\n256\n00:14:31.950 --> 00:14:33.810\nLet's see if we can do this\nin the middle of the show.\n\n257\n00:14:33.810 --> 00:14:37.565\nLet's do a text message,\n\n258\n00:14:37.565 --> 00:14:44.174\nand, Maybe not.\n\n259\n00:14:44.174 --> 00:14:44.779\nI'll tell you what I'll do.\n\n260\n00:14:44.779 --> 00:14:47.747\nLet me click United States here.\n\n261\n00:14:47.747 --> 00:14:51.797\nLet's kill the screens here for just one\nsecond as I type in my personal phone\n\n262\n00:14:51.797 --> 00:14:54.470\nnumber, so\nthat I can get this text message back.\n\n263\n00:14:56.470 --> 00:14:58.341\nOops, uncheck that Num Lock.\n\n264\n00:15:03.606 --> 00:15:06.220\nOkay, you can bring that back up,\nthere we go.\n\n265\n00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:09.930\nAnd it shouldn't take me too terribly\nlong to get that message, hopefully.\n\n266\n00:15:09.930 --> 00:15:11.320\nThere it is.\n\n267\n00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:13.780\nSo I enter in my security\ncode that they sent me.\n\n268\n00:15:15.997 --> 00:15:17.567\nI'll click Next.\n\n269\n00:15:22.319 --> 00:15:28.591\nAnd it looks like we're requiring\na multifactor, so I will create a pin.\n\n270\n00:15:28.591 --> 00:15:37.580\nAnd, Sorry, I can't talk and\ncreate a number at the same time.\n\n271\n00:15:38.730 --> 00:15:41.320\nThat's right, I forgot.\n\n272\n00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:45.929\nThere are some really cool\ncomplexity rules when it comes to\n\n273\n00:15:45.929 --> 00:15:48.700\ncreating pins in Azure and Intune.\n\n274\n00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:50.167\nAnd it looks for patterns.\n\n275\n00:15:50.167 --> 00:15:53.668\nAnd I tried to the whole one, two,\nthree, four, five, six, seven, and\n\n276\n00:15:53.668 --> 00:15:55.125\nwhat it looks at is the deltas.\n\n277\n00:15:55.125 --> 00:15:56.311\nSo one to two, right?\n\n278\n00:15:56.311 --> 00:15:58.588\nIt's a change of one,\ntwo to three is a change of one.\n\n279\n00:15:58.588 --> 00:16:00.774\nSo a constant delta across the number.\n\n280\n00:16:00.774 --> 00:16:04.670\nIt's not gonna be valid,\nyou can't use patterns like that.\n\n281\n00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:06.560\nSo let me change that to something else.\n\n282\n00:16:10.791 --> 00:16:12.360\nHopefully, I did that correctly.\n\n283\n00:16:13.950 --> 00:16:15.860\nI'll never remember what that pin is.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n284\n00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:17.700\n&gt;&gt; So this device is toast\n\n285\n00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:19.500\nwhen your account is done.\n\n286\n00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:20.220\nClick Next.\n\n287\n00:16:21.530 --> 00:16:22.910\nVerify by account password.\n\n288\n00:16:22.910 --> 00:16:26.050\nNow, I know I'm tying this in\nwith an account name Nate.\n\n289\n00:16:26.050 --> 00:16:28.020\nI'm just doing this for\na demonstration, right?\n\n290\n00:16:30.743 --> 00:16:31.870\nBut there we go.\n\n291\n00:16:31.870 --> 00:16:35.270\nSo this is a device, again,\nthat is not part of my domain.\n\n292\n00:16:35.270 --> 00:16:39.870\nThis could be your user's home computer,\ntheir personal laptop, and\n\n293\n00:16:39.870 --> 00:16:42.810\nthey're able to connect to Intune.\n\n294\n00:16:42.810 --> 00:16:47.570\nAnd now, if we go back over to Intune,\nall right, and\n\n295\n00:16:47.570 --> 00:16:50.870\nwe take a look at Devices,\nand then All Devices.\n\n296\n00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:52.590\nLets see if it shows up yet.\n\n297\n00:16:52.590 --> 00:16:57.390\nSure enough, it's right there, Home01,\nis the machine we were just on.\n\n298\n00:16:57.390 --> 00:17:01.580\nNow, if I click on that, I can see the\nability to take a look at the properties,\n\n299\n00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:07.210\nremove data, factory reset, restart\nthe machine, apply policies, right?\n\n300\n00:17:07.210 --> 00:17:10.720\nConfiguration policies,\ncompliance policies.\n\n301\n00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:12.200\nHey, look, if you don't have\nyour antivirus up to date,\n\n302\n00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:14.580\nyou can't connect to that VPN server,\n\n303\n00:17:14.580 --> 00:17:18.410\nall of that good stuff, even though\nthis guy's not part of my domain.\n\n304\n00:17:18.410 --> 00:17:21.700\nYears ago you couldn't imagine doing this.\n\n305\n00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:24.920\nIf it wasn't part of your network,\nyou couldn't apply group policy to it,\n\n306\n00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:27.420\nyou couldn't manage it, right?\n\n307\n00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:31.630\nWith Intune, I can mange all of these\ndevices across multiple platforms.\n\n308\n00:17:31.630 --> 00:17:33.450\nSo it's a wonderful thing.\n\n309\n00:17:33.450 --> 00:17:34.560\nAgain, changing fast.\n\n310\n00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:38.247\nI can't stress enough,\nyou should really set up a trial and\n\n311\n00:17:38.247 --> 00:17:42.535\ngo out there and play, and\nclick on everything, and try things out.\n\n312\n00:17:42.535 --> 00:17:47.168\nIt's the best way to learn, and\nthat's why they give you those trials.\n\n313\n00:17:47.168 --> 00:17:51.060\nAll right, Cherokee, I think that\nprobably does it, at least for\n\n314\n00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:52.900\nmobile device policies.\n\n315\n00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:54.590\nWe will be coming back around and\n\n316\n00:17:54.590 --> 00:17:57.730\ntalking much more about Intune\nin some other episodes.\n\n317\n00:17:57.730 --> 00:17:59.100\nBut now,\nI want to take a look at something,\n\n318\n00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:01.730\nthe next objective they call out,\nsupport mobile access and\n\n319\n00:18:01.730 --> 00:18:06.530\ndata synchronization including\nwork folders and sync center.\n\n320\n00:18:06.530 --> 00:18:09.770\nIt sounds exciting, right?\n&gt;&gt; We've talked about this before, Mike.\n\n321\n00:18:09.770 --> 00:18:10.290\n&gt;&gt; We have,\n\n322\n00:18:10.290 --> 00:18:10.870\nhaven't we?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n323\n00:18:10.870 --> 00:18:14.420\nyou know how I feel about it.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's right, work folders is\n\n324\n00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:17.660\none of your favorite things.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n325\n00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:19.430\n&gt;&gt; It can be frustrating at times,\n\n326\n00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:21.590\nat least on the set up side of things.\n\n327\n00:18:21.590 --> 00:18:25.720\nBut from an end user's point of view,\nI think work folders is pretty cool.\n\n328\n00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:28.728\nAnd it's a concept that we're\nall familiar with already,\n\n329\n00:18:28.728 --> 00:18:30.540\neven if you don't you are, right?\n\n330\n00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:33.639\nBecause most of us,\nI shouldn't say all of us,\n\n331\n00:18:33.639 --> 00:18:39.142\nmost of us are familiar with Cloud type\nservices, storage solutions like Dropbox,\n\n332\n00:18:39.142 --> 00:18:43.348\nand OneDrive, and\nthe various other Cloud storage solutions.\n\n333\n00:18:43.348 --> 00:18:48.530\nAnd what's cool about those is the fact\nthat I can store stuff in my OneDrive,\n\n334\n00:18:48.530 --> 00:18:50.250\nright from this machine.\n\n335\n00:18:50.250 --> 00:18:55.030\nI can go home to another machine, log on\nwith that same Microsoft account, and\n\n336\n00:18:55.030 --> 00:18:57.830\naccess OneDrive and see those same files.\n\n337\n00:18:57.830 --> 00:19:01.292\nSo it's this repository where I can store\ninformation in this Cloud based solution\n\n338\n00:19:01.292 --> 00:19:04.570\nwhere I can access that information from\nany device that has Internet access.\n\n339\n00:19:04.570 --> 00:19:07.490\nIt's fantastic, love it, all right?\n\n340\n00:19:07.490 --> 00:19:09.200\nAnd that's really what work folders is,\nright?\n\n341\n00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:14.375\nWork folders is the same idea,\nexcept instead of me storing it out there\n\n342\n00:19:14.375 --> 00:19:20.050\nin the Cloud, we're gonna store it\na share on a corporate server, right?\n\n343\n00:19:20.050 --> 00:19:22.000\nJust a file server on\nmy corporate network.\n\n344\n00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.620\nSame concept, though.\n\n345\n00:19:23.620 --> 00:19:27.440\nWhen I'm at work and I'm connected to\nthe network, I can connect to that file\n\n346\n00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:32.215\nserver, and I can put things in that work\nfolder, that share on that file server.\n\n347\n00:19:32.215 --> 00:19:36.790\nAnd when I go home,\nI can also connect to that server, and\n\n348\n00:19:36.790 --> 00:19:38.800\nI can access those same files.\n\n349\n00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:40.010\nSo it's the same thing.\n\n350\n00:19:40.010 --> 00:19:43.344\nIt's a place to store data that I\ncan access from multiple machines\n\n351\n00:19:43.344 --> 00:19:44.960\nanywhere with network access.\n\n352\n00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:48.860\nThe difference is,\nit's under my control, right.\n\n353\n00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:52.710\nWhen it comes to OneDrive, there are some\nthings I can control with OneDrive, but\n\n354\n00:19:52.710 --> 00:19:55.290\nI can't apply quotas to it, for example.\n\n355\n00:19:55.290 --> 00:19:57.998\nI can't do file screens and\nsay you know what,\n\n356\n00:19:57.998 --> 00:20:01.200\nI don't want anybody storing mp3s up here,\nor AVIs.\n\n357\n00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:03.890\nI don't want multimedia up here.\n\n358\n00:20:03.890 --> 00:20:05.226\nI can't do that with OneDrive.\n\n359\n00:20:05.226 --> 00:20:07.650\nThey're not my servers,\nthey're not under my control.\n\n360\n00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:11.210\nWhereas with work folders, I can, right?\n\n361\n00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:15.890\nThis is a share that I'm setting up in\nhouse, and I can put quotas on there, and\n\n362\n00:20:15.890 --> 00:20:19.030\nI can do file screens and\nthings like that.\n\n363\n00:20:19.030 --> 00:20:24.350\nSo same concept, just gives administrators\na little more control over it.\n\n364\n00:20:24.350 --> 00:20:27.100\nAll right, so\nlet's take a look at that solution.\n\n365\n00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:29.780\nI've already got it set up on my server.\n\n366\n00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:33.250\nNow, I can show you the backend of things,\nall though,\n\n367\n00:20:33.250 --> 00:20:37.880\nI wouldn't expect them to get you\ntoo much on the set up of this.\n\n368\n00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:39.970\nBut it's a role that I've installed.\n\n369\n00:20:39.970 --> 00:20:43.810\nIt's part of the file and storage\nservices, it's a sub-feature of that.\n\n370\n00:20:43.810 --> 00:20:46.000\nSo you go to Add roles and features.\n\n371\n00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:50.590\nExpand out files, storage solutions or\nservices, and select work folders, and\n\n372\n00:20:50.590 --> 00:20:54.430\ninstall the role, and\nthat's really all you have to do.\n\n373\n00:20:54.430 --> 00:20:55.856\nWell, that's how you role installed.\n\n374\n00:20:55.856 --> 00:20:57.350\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I was just gonna say you make it so\n\n375\n00:20:57.350 --> 00:20:57.850\neasy, Mike.\n\n376\n00:20:57.850 --> 00:21:02.469\nBut in all joking aside, getting it\nsetup can be a process, but then,\n\n377\n00:21:02.469 --> 00:21:04.100\nreally, that's it.\n\n378\n00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:05.630\nOnce you get it setup,\n\n379\n00:21:05.630 --> 00:21:08.170\nyou're not going to be going in\nthere changing it all the time.\n\n380\n00:21:08.170 --> 00:21:12.360\nYou can be connecting users and\nsetting it up on the client side,\n\n381\n00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:14.910\nbut that really is super easy.\n&gt;&gt; It is, isn't it?\n\n382\n00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.070\nAnd I've already got this set up, and I've\nenabled it for a group called Host, but\n\n383\n00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:20.930\nlet me show you the process real quick.\n\n384\n00:21:20.930 --> 00:21:25.303\nIf I hit this drop-down list,\nI could, not that drop down list.\n\n385\n00:21:25.303 --> 00:21:26.870\nTasks &gt; New Sync Share.\n\n386\n00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:30.330\nAnd when you first install this, you won't\nhave any shares, and there'll be a blue\n\n387\n00:21:30.330 --> 00:21:34.550\nlink right in the middle of the page out\nhere that says News Sync Share as well.\n\n388\n00:21:34.550 --> 00:21:35.250\nYou click that, and\n\n389\n00:21:35.250 --> 00:21:40.625\nit walks you through a wizard where\nyou're going to create a location.\n\n390\n00:21:40.625 --> 00:21:45.422\nAnd maybe I come over here, and\non the C drive, I make a new folder,\n\n391\n00:21:45.422 --> 00:21:47.670\nand I'll call this Live Demo.\n\n392\n00:21:47.670 --> 00:21:50.080\nWhoops, can't spell.\n\n393\n00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:53.716\nAll right, I'll select that folder.\n\n394\n00:21:53.716 --> 00:21:56.925\nThen I'll click Next.\n\n395\n00:21:56.925 --> 00:22:00.251\nDecide whether or\nnot it's gonna be their user alias,\n\n396\n00:22:00.251 --> 00:22:04.465\nwhich would be my log on name,\nlike Mike or Mike R or M Roderick.\n\n397\n00:22:04.465 --> 00:22:05.725\nOr alias at domain.\n\n398\n00:22:05.725 --> 00:22:09.690\nSo it'd be MikeR@ITPROTVdemo.com.\n\n399\n00:22:09.690 --> 00:22:13.735\nIf you have multiple domains in your\nforest, you wanna go with this option.\n\n400\n00:22:13.735 --> 00:22:17.555\nOtherwise, you can end up with two\nMikes in different domains and\n\n401\n00:22:17.555 --> 00:22:20.020\na conflict if you just use the user alias.\n\n402\n00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:21.650\nThen you click Next.\n\n403\n00:22:21.650 --> 00:22:23.690\nGive it a name for the share.\n\n404\n00:22:23.690 --> 00:22:28.960\nAnd then you add the users that you\nwant to, I'll do the host again,\n\n405\n00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:32.110\nit won't do anything, won't cause any\nproblems, setting this up twice for them.\n\n406\n00:22:33.130 --> 00:22:34.935\nActually, it might, so\nI better not finish this.\n\n407\n00:22:34.935 --> 00:22:38.180\n[LAUGH] I don't wanna cause a problem for\nthe guys that I've already set up.\n\n408\n00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:39.880\nBut you would add the group.\n\n409\n00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:42.970\nYou could do all domain users,\nyou could do individual groups.\n\n410\n00:22:42.970 --> 00:22:46.830\nAnd if you wanted everybody, if their\nwork folder was on one file server,\n\n411\n00:22:46.830 --> 00:22:49.135\nyou just do all domain users or\nsomething like that.\n\n412\n00:22:49.135 --> 00:22:53.950\nBut it might be a situation where most of\nyour users store their work folders on one\n\n413\n00:22:53.950 --> 00:22:58.590\nfile server, but your R&amp;D people,\ntheir work folders\n\n414\n00:22:58.590 --> 00:23:02.050\nis on a different file server, cuz it's\na different level of security maybe.\n\n415\n00:23:02.050 --> 00:23:04.180\nOr the C level execs,\n\n416\n00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:08.530\ntheir stuff has to be over on a different\nfile server from everybody else's.\n\n417\n00:23:08.530 --> 00:23:09.700\nYou know the idea.\n\n418\n00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:11.670\nAll right, we click Next.\n\n419\n00:23:11.670 --> 00:23:15.432\nI can choose to encrypt the work folders,\nautomatically lock the screen and\n\n420\n00:23:15.432 --> 00:23:16.560\nrequire password.\n\n421\n00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:19.780\nBecause if you're gonna be accessing\nthis from your home machine,\n\n422\n00:23:19.780 --> 00:23:23.770\nI wanna make sure that if any data sync\ndown to that machine, that it's encrypted.\n\n423\n00:23:23.770 --> 00:23:27.830\nAnd that that machine I'm syncing\ndown to is using the lock screen and\n\n424\n00:23:27.830 --> 00:23:28.810\nhas a password.\n\n425\n00:23:28.810 --> 00:23:32.728\nI don't want you syncing corporate data\nonto a device that doesn't even have\n\n426\n00:23:32.728 --> 00:23:33.880\na password required.\n\n427\n00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:35.409\nThat means anybody could\npick up your device, right?\n\n428\n00:23:35.409 --> 00:23:37.670\nYeah, that would not be good.\n\n429\n00:23:37.670 --> 00:23:39.480\nNext, you'd confirm all this.\n\n430\n00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:42.250\nI'm gonna click Cancel,\nyou would click Create, obviously.\n\n431\n00:23:43.950 --> 00:23:45.020\nAnd then, it's gonna set it up.\n\n432\n00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:49.420\nAnd you can see here, those\nare the users that are in my host group.\n\n433\n00:23:49.420 --> 00:23:51.460\nAnd it's already got them set up.\n\n434\n00:23:51.460 --> 00:23:57.186\nNow, the folder I used on the file\nserver is actually on my C: drive.\n\n435\n00:23:57.186 --> 00:23:59.818\nWhich you wouldn't want to do\nin the real world because, then,\n\n436\n00:23:59.818 --> 00:24:03.061\nyour users could end up storing so much\ndata that they filled up your C: drive.\n\n437\n00:24:03.061 --> 00:24:05.968\nEither set of quotas or\nput this on a separate drive.\n\n438\n00:24:05.968 --> 00:24:08.310\nBut in there,\nI've tested this out with Adam.\n\n439\n00:24:08.310 --> 00:24:11.970\nBut what I want you to see is that,\nnot everybody has a folder yet.\n\n440\n00:24:11.970 --> 00:24:15.050\nOnly if they actually set up\nwork folders on their client.\n\n441\n00:24:15.050 --> 00:24:17.660\nIt doesn't automatically\ncreate folders for everybody.\n\n442\n00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:21.010\nAnd this is a thing I see people do,\nthey'll set up work folders,\n\n443\n00:24:21.010 --> 00:24:24.660\nthey go look at the share and\ngo, it didn't make any folders.\n\n444\n00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:27.800\nIt doesn't make them, until they\nactually configure it on their end.\n\n445\n00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:29.840\nWhat I've done is said yes Adam, yes Dan,\n\n446\n00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:31.940\nyes Cherokee,\nyou're allowed to use work folders.\n\n447\n00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:34.660\nYou have permission to, but\nif Cherokee never goes and\n\n448\n00:24:34.660 --> 00:24:39.040\nsets up work folders on any of her\ndevices, then it won't be created.\n\n449\n00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:43.860\nNow you can also use group policy to\ncreate this, to set up the clients, or,\n\n450\n00:24:43.860 --> 00:24:45.410\nthe client can do it themselves.\n\n451\n00:24:45.410 --> 00:24:48.310\nCherokee can go into her machine,\nand into her Control Panel, and\n\n452\n00:24:48.310 --> 00:24:53.100\nset up work folders, or I can use group\npolicy to configure that for them.\n\n453\n00:24:53.100 --> 00:24:56.930\nWe can also force them to set it up,\nas it is now,\n\n454\n00:24:56.930 --> 00:25:00.280\nif Cherokee doesn't wanna use work\nfolders, she doesn't have to.\n\n455\n00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:04.250\nShe has the ability if she wants to,\nbut nobody's telling her she has to.\n\n456\n00:25:04.250 --> 00:25:06.130\nWe can also force it with group policy,\n\n457\n00:25:06.130 --> 00:25:10.140\nand automatically set up\neverybody to use work folders.\n\n458\n00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:13.710\nAnd then whether Cherokee likes it or\nnot, it'll be configured on her device.\n\n459\n00:25:13.710 --> 00:25:18.960\nShe might not actually use it, but\nit would already be configured, and\n\n460\n00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:20.500\nthat's done through group policy.\n\n461\n00:25:21.910 --> 00:25:24.390\nYou can go into computer settings,\nwell I can show you I guess,\n\n462\n00:25:24.390 --> 00:25:25.830\nI shouldn't just say that,\nI should show you.\n\n463\n00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:30.029\nThat's why we call these demonstrations,\nso\n\n464\n00:25:30.029 --> 00:25:33.243\nlet's go in here and,\ndid I lose my connection.\n\n465\n00:25:37.104 --> 00:25:39.270\nWell let's connect back over\nto that domain controller.\n\n466\n00:25:39.270 --> 00:25:43.770\nI'm going to pull up a group policy,\nI would not normally use my default\n\n467\n00:25:43.770 --> 00:25:47.630\nname policy, but just to show you,\ncompute under, there's two.\n\n468\n00:25:47.630 --> 00:25:49.260\nComputer configuration policies,\n\n469\n00:25:49.260 --> 00:25:54.060\nadministrative templates,\nwindows components and then work folders.\n\n470\n00:25:54.060 --> 00:25:58.020\nAnd this is where I can force\nautomatic setup for all users.\n\n471\n00:25:58.020 --> 00:26:02.210\nAnd it's really a simple policy, you just\nturn it on, and that's gonna force it.\n\n472\n00:26:02.210 --> 00:26:07.300\nUnder the user portion policies,\nadministrative templates,\n\n473\n00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:13.410\nWindows components, work folders,\nthere's specify work folders settings.\n\n474\n00:26:13.410 --> 00:26:17.660\nSo, if I want to provide\nthe settings via group policy, so\n\n475\n00:26:17.660 --> 00:26:20.610\nthat Cherokee doesn't have to know\nwhat to fill in in those fields,\n\n476\n00:26:20.610 --> 00:26:23.500\nI use this setting here\nunder the user portion.\n\n477\n00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:25.610\nThis is how I push out the configuration.\n\n478\n00:26:25.610 --> 00:26:26.690\nWhat is the server name?\n\n479\n00:26:26.690 --> 00:26:28.370\nWhere is that workfolder located?\n\n480\n00:26:28.370 --> 00:26:29.690\nHow do I connect to it?\n\n481\n00:26:29.690 --> 00:26:32.110\nThat's this information here,\nthis workfolder URL,\n\n482\n00:26:32.110 --> 00:26:38.100\nthere's also a force automatic\nsetup check mark here, same thing.\n\n483\n00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:42.710\nHonestly, this could be scoped to\nindividual users, whereas, the computer\n\n484\n00:26:42.710 --> 00:26:47.550\nportion, the one we just looked at, would\nbe scoped to every user on that computer.\n\n485\n00:26:47.550 --> 00:26:51.890\nIf you use that computer policy to\nforce it, you have to use this.\n\n486\n00:26:51.890 --> 00:26:55.250\nBecause remember, the other one just\nsaid force users to use it, but\n\n487\n00:26:55.250 --> 00:26:57.490\nit didn't assign the URL.\n\n488\n00:26:57.490 --> 00:27:01.760\nSo if you configure the computer portion\nof a group policy, to force users to\n\n489\n00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:06.160\nuse work folders, but you don't configure\nthis policy under the user settings,\n\n490\n00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:08.690\nto tell it where work folders is.\n&gt;&gt; It won't know where to go.\n\n491\n00:27:08.690 --> 00:27:09.840\n&gt;&gt; And it will fail.\n\n492\n00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:12.810\nIt won't actually force them,\nbecause it can't set it up, so\n\n493\n00:27:12.810 --> 00:27:13.760\njust keep that in mind.\n\n494\n00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:15.830\nIf you're gonna use the force option,\n\n495\n00:27:15.830 --> 00:27:20.220\nyou have to configure the specify\nwork folder setting policy, as well.\n\n496\n00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:23.750\nBut you can specify work folder\nsettings without forcing,\n\n497\n00:27:23.750 --> 00:27:25.365\nhopefully that makes sense.\n\n498\n00:27:25.365 --> 00:27:27.010\n[LAUGH] All right,\nlet me cancel out of that.\n\n499\n00:27:27.010 --> 00:27:29.100\nI'm not gonna do any of that,\nwe're gonna do it all manually,\n\n500\n00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:31.360\nbecause that's the way we\nlike to roll around here.\n\n501\n00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:35.860\nWe'll get rid of that little warning, and\nlet me figure out what machine I am on.\n\n502\n00:27:35.860 --> 00:27:40.960\nLet's go back to client one here, so\nthis was Cherokee's domain member laptop.\n\n503\n00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:43.070\nThis was like the one she\ncomes in to work every day.\n\n504\n00:27:43.070 --> 00:27:47.080\nI'm just gonna go to my start menu and\ntype in\n\n505\n00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:54.749\nwork folders, and we'll find that\ncontrol panel applet for work folders.\n\n506\n00:27:55.850 --> 00:27:58.440\nAnd then I have a link\nto set up work folders.\n\n507\n00:27:59.650 --> 00:28:03.760\nNow, I'm gonna use a URL\nbecause in my lab environment,\n\n508\n00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:05.470\nmy users don't have email addresses.\n\n509\n00:28:05.470 --> 00:28:10.700\nNormally you would have email addresses\nassociated with your user accounts,\n\n510\n00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:12.840\nand you'd set it up that way.\n\n511\n00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:16.450\nThat's usually people, that's their log\non name, so it makes it nice and easy for\n\n512\n00:28:16.450 --> 00:28:17.520\nmy users.\n\n513\n00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:20.340\nI'm gonna use a URL just\nbecause of my lab environment,\n\n514\n00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:22.262\nmost of the time you would not do this.\n\n515\n00:28:22.262 --> 00:28:25.524\nI'm also gonna be using HTTP,\n\n516\n00:28:25.524 --> 00:28:29.919\nby default work folders requires HTTPS.\n\n517\n00:28:29.919 --> 00:28:34.000\nI didn't go through the trouble of setting\nup an SSL certificate on my work folder\n\n518\n00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.291\nserver, the one that's hosting the share.\n\n519\n00:28:36.291 --> 00:28:39.305\nSo I going to use HTTP, but\nto do this, I had to do four or\n\n520\n00:28:39.305 --> 00:28:41.550\nfive registry hacks to get this to work.\n\n521\n00:28:41.550 --> 00:28:45.352\nWhich [LAUGH], probably would have been\neasier just to set up the SSL certificate.\n\n522\n00:28:45.352 --> 00:28:49.156\n[LAUGH] Now, there is some, we talked\nabout how fun it is to set up, and\n\n523\n00:28:49.156 --> 00:28:52.250\nwhen you create the certificate for\nwork folders.\n\n524\n00:28:52.250 --> 00:28:55.440\nYou have to pay attention to what\ngoes into the subject name, and\n\n525\n00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:57.650\nwhat goes into the subject\nalternative name.\n\n526\n00:28:57.650 --> 00:29:00.820\nIt has to match certain things\nin your environment, and\n\n527\n00:29:00.820 --> 00:29:03.450\nit can be a little tricky and\nit was much easier for me.\n\n528\n00:29:03.450 --> 00:29:07.260\nI actually have a little script, because I\ndo this so often, that creates the three\n\n529\n00:29:07.260 --> 00:29:11.640\nregistry keys, that will allow me\nto connect in an insecure fashion.\n\n530\n00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:14.230\nNever, ever do this in\na production environment.\n\n531\n00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:26.160\nAnd it is simply SVRO1.ITProTVDemo.com,\nthat's the name of my work folder server.\n\n532\n00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:27.720\nSo that's the URL, click next.\n\n533\n00:29:29.310 --> 00:29:32.604\nAnd if everything goes well and\nCherokee does have permission, and\n\n534\n00:29:32.604 --> 00:29:35.750\nyou saw me give the host\npermission to set up work folders.\n\n535\n00:29:35.750 --> 00:29:37.410\nYou should see something like this,\n\n536\n00:29:37.410 --> 00:29:39.830\nWork Fit is telling me where work\nfolders are going to show up.\n\n537\n00:29:39.830 --> 00:29:43.550\nIt's also telling me where it's going to\nstore it, you might want to change that.\n\n538\n00:29:43.550 --> 00:29:46.740\nMaybe I've got a D drive that I wanted\nall my synced content to be on,\n\n539\n00:29:46.740 --> 00:29:47.320\nnot my C drive.\n\n540\n00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:48.850\nYou can definitely change that.\n\n541\n00:29:48.850 --> 00:29:51.590\nI'll leave the default, we'll click Next.\n\n542\n00:29:51.590 --> 00:29:55.630\nDo note that the default is\nC:users/cherokee/workfolders so\n\n543\n00:29:55.630 --> 00:30:01.660\nit's basically the user's\nprofile/workfolders, we'll click Next.\n\n544\n00:30:01.660 --> 00:30:05.956\nAnd now it's telling me hey, depending\non how your admin has set this up,\n\n545\n00:30:05.956 --> 00:30:10.200\nit might require you to encrypt,\nit might require you to use a password.\n\n546\n00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:14.767\nAnd Cherokee says, well, I hate using\npasswords, so I'm not setting it up and\n\n547\n00:30:14.767 --> 00:30:15.527\ncancel out.\n\n548\n00:30:15.527 --> 00:30:19.290\nBut it gives them that one chance to say,\nthey're gonna be changing policies,\n\n549\n00:30:19.290 --> 00:30:23.053\nif in this case it's a corporate device,\nbut if this was your personal device,\n\n550\n00:30:23.053 --> 00:30:25.480\nyou might not agree to\nthe company policies.\n\n551\n00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:28.350\nWhich is fine, you can't access\nWork Folders if you don't,\n\n552\n00:30:28.350 --> 00:30:30.330\nbut that's your call.\n\n553\n00:30:30.330 --> 00:30:34.390\nSo I will accept the policies, and\nI'll click Set-Up Work Folders.\n\n554\n00:30:34.390 --> 00:30:37.460\nAnd it'll whirr and grind,\nand I will close the wizard.\n\n555\n00:30:38.900 --> 00:30:41.720\nAnd there we go,\nI have a new folder called Work Folders.\n\n556\n00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:44.080\nAnd this is right underneath My profiles.\n\n557\n00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:51.250\nSo if I go to C: users,\nCherokee should see there is Work Folders.\n\n558\n00:30:51.250 --> 00:30:53.020\nThey give you a nice\nlink to it right here,\n\n559\n00:30:53.020 --> 00:30:55.550\nand let's go ahead put a file in there.\n\n560\n00:30:55.550 --> 00:31:01.840\nWe'll do a new text document,\nI'll say WF demo for work folder, demo.\n\n561\n00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:08.650\nand we're going to close that,\nand it gives me some information,\n\n562\n00:31:08.650 --> 00:31:09.830\nyou can see it's syncing there.\n\n563\n00:31:09.830 --> 00:31:13.050\nI've also reduced the pooling\nintervals to about 15 seconds.\n\n564\n00:31:13.050 --> 00:31:17.150\nBy default it's ten minutes, but\nI don't want to make a change, and\n\n565\n00:31:17.150 --> 00:31:20.060\nthen I have to wait ten minutes\nbefore synchronization occurs.\n\n566\n00:31:20.060 --> 00:31:24.218\nSo you might see this kind of a flash\na couple times while we're doing this,\n\n567\n00:31:24.218 --> 00:31:28.977\nunderstand that I have reduced the polling\ninterval, way down to like 15 seconds.\n\n568\n00:31:28.977 --> 00:31:33.294\nBut you get information on how much space\nyou have available when it last synced, if\n\n569\n00:31:33.294 --> 00:31:37.624\nyou want to sync over metered connections,\nyou see it won't have any file errors.\n\n570\n00:31:37.624 --> 00:31:42.488\nIf there was any conflict or\nany conflictings during any,\n\n571\n00:31:42.488 --> 00:31:44.820\nI cannot say that word.\n\n572\n00:31:44.820 --> 00:31:47.285\nAny conflicts occur\nduring synchronization,\n\n573\n00:31:47.285 --> 00:31:50.422\nit can give you those, that info.\n&gt;&gt; And you mean,\n\n574\n00:31:50.422 --> 00:31:53.220\nlike if I had this setup\non multiple devices.\n\n575\n00:31:53.220 --> 00:31:54.780\nIf I was, let me rephrase it,\n\n576\n00:31:54.780 --> 00:31:55.752\nmy words also.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n577\n00:31:55.752 --> 00:31:58.122\n&gt;&gt; Like if I had a file open on my laptop,\n\n578\n00:31:58.122 --> 00:32:01.792\nthat was connected into the network And\nI made a change and\n\n579\n00:32:01.792 --> 00:32:06.230\nthen it got my car [INAUDIBLE] at\nStarbucks to grab an espresso because I\n\n580\n00:32:06.230 --> 00:32:08.550\nwas getting really tired, [LAUGH].\n\n581\n00:32:08.550 --> 00:32:13.312\nBut while I was waiting for the barrister\nto finish, I start working on that\n\n582\n00:32:13.312 --> 00:32:17.394\ndocument and then there are two\nopen instances of the same file so\n\n583\n00:32:17.394 --> 00:32:21.190\nyou can then decide how you\nwanna handle that discrepancy.\n\n584\n00:32:21.190 --> 00:32:22.140\n&gt;&gt; Exactly right.\n\n585\n00:32:22.140 --> 00:32:24.770\nMaybe, yeah, somehow it had been editing\nthe same file from two different\n\n586\n00:32:24.770 --> 00:32:26.692\nlocations, before\nthe synchronization occurred and\n\n587\n00:32:26.692 --> 00:32:28.421\nwhen it syncs it doesn't\nknow which one to keep.\n\n588\n00:32:28.421 --> 00:32:32.250\nSo, yeah, you could handle those here,\nexactly right.\n\n589\n00:32:32.250 --> 00:32:34.420\nAll right, let me close that out and\n\n590\n00:32:34.420 --> 00:32:39.160\nlet's go over to a home machine,\nwhere we're gonna do the same thing.\n\n591\n00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:40.780\nSo this is not a member of the domain.\n\n592\n00:32:40.780 --> 00:32:45.807\nAll right, I'm gonna type in Home Depot or\n\n593\n00:32:45.807 --> 00:32:47.841\nhomegroup.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n594\n00:32:47.841 --> 00:32:49.114\n&gt;&gt; All right, oops,\n\n595\n00:32:49.114 --> 00:32:50.790\nwhy did I say homegroup?\n\n596\n00:32:50.790 --> 00:32:51.440\nWork folders,\n\n597\n00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:52.930\nI don't know what I'm thinking here.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n598\n00:32:52.930 --> 00:32:54.590\n&gt;&gt; Now, let's do work folders.\n\n599\n00:32:56.310 --> 00:32:58.397\nGot my shows mixed up.\n&gt;&gt; I know, I was gonna say,\n\n600\n00:32:58.397 --> 00:33:00.659\nwe've been all over the place,\nthough, so, yeah [CROSSTALK]\n\n601\n00:33:00.659 --> 00:33:02.331\n&gt;&gt; All right, so same thing,\n\n602\n00:33:02.331 --> 00:33:05.280\nset up work folders\n&gt;&gt; I'm going to use a URL.\n\n603\n00:33:08.140 --> 00:33:11.630\nAgain, if you've watched the server\nepisodes where we talk about setting this\n\n604\n00:33:11.630 --> 00:33:15.120\nup, obviously there have to be\nsome name resolution going on.\n\n605\n00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:20.240\nIf I'm at home and I type in a URL,\nhow is it finding that corporate server?\n\n606\n00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:22.310\nSo we've got DNS entries to worry about.\n\n607\n00:33:22.310 --> 00:33:24.590\nMaking sure they can\nconnect from the outside.\n\n608\n00:33:24.590 --> 00:33:29.620\nThis is why email addresses and\ncertificates is primarily used.\n\n609\n00:33:29.620 --> 00:33:33.910\nBecause that home computer needs\nto be able to find it from outside\n\n610\n00:33:33.910 --> 00:33:35.552\nthe corporate network.\n\n611\n00:33:35.552 --> 00:33:41.574\nBut in my test lab environment this should\nwork just fine, rsbr01.itprotvdemo.com.\n\n612\n00:33:43.420 --> 00:33:47.300\nAll right, and\nit tells me that that is not right.\n\n613\n00:33:47.300 --> 00:33:48.530\nDid I type that in wrong?\n\n614\n00:33:48.530 --> 00:33:49.480\nShould have an encrypted URL.\n\n615\n00:33:52.710 --> 00:33:53.300\nYou know what?\n\n616\n00:33:53.300 --> 00:33:57.080\nI didn't do the same registry\nhacks on this machine.\n\n617\n00:33:57.080 --> 00:33:59.760\nI forgot when I was setting this up.\n&gt;&gt; So it's looking for a certificate?\n\n618\n00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:02.433\n&gt;&gt; It is requiring HTTPS to set this\n\n619\n00:34:02.433 --> 00:34:03.126\nup, and\n\n620\n00:34:03.126 --> 00:34:06.842\nI don't have that darn script over here.\n&gt;&gt; I gotta\n\n621\n00:34:06.842 --> 00:34:09.600\nget that from you by the way [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I will have to get that.\n\n622\n00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:11.200\nSo I know we're about out of time.\n\n623\n00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:15.460\nI tell you what, we've got a little bit\nmore to do with mobile devices anyway.\n\n624\n00:34:15.460 --> 00:34:18.130\nSo why don't we just stop there,\nI'll leave my screen where it is.\n\n625\n00:34:18.130 --> 00:34:19.650\nI'll go grab that script or\n\n626\n00:34:19.650 --> 00:34:23.910\nat least show you the registry\nentries that need to be made.\n\n627\n00:34:23.910 --> 00:34:27.100\nOr I'll do that, again, I'm debating\nwhether I should show people that\n\n628\n00:34:27.100 --> 00:34:29.260\nbecause it's definitely not recommended.\n\n629\n00:34:29.260 --> 00:34:32.320\nBut if you wanna set up a test lab,\nit's the best way to do it.\n\n630\n00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:35.050\nSo I'll show you, but\nwe'll have to wait till part 3.\n\n631\n00:34:35.050 --> 00:34:36.500\n&gt;&gt; Perfect, Michael, thank you so much for\n\n632\n00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:38.270\nyour time and your demonstration today.\n\n633\n00:34:38.270 --> 00:34:39.870\nBut for now let's sign out.\n\n634\n00:34:39.870 --> 00:34:42.140\nI've been your host, Cherokee Boose.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n635\n00:34:42.140 --> 00:34:44.247\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITPro TV.\n\n636\n00:34:44.247 -->

and\n\n8\n00:00:23.459 --> 00:00:27.076\nlearning how to set up and\nsupport our mobile devices.\n\n9\n00:00:27.076 --> 00:00:28.875\nSpecifically, what were\nwe working on there?\n\n10\n00:00:28.875 --> 00:00:29.954\nWork folders.\n&gt;&gt; Work folders.\n\n11\n00:00:29.954 --> 00:00:32.371\n&gt;&gt; Mr. Mike Roderick in studios to help us\n\n12\n00:00:32.371 --> 00:00:35.467\nwith that task.\n&gt;&gt; That's right, yeah, so we got to see it\n\n13\n00:00:35.467 --> 00:00:39.850\nbeing set up for a corporate device, but\nthat's really only half of the fun, right?\n\n14\n00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.581\nThe whole idea behind work folders is,\nit's a location where I can store files,\n\n15\n00:00:44.581 --> 00:00:46.820\nand access it from multiple devices.\n\n16\n00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.472\nSo if I create a file while I'm at work,\nand\n\n17\n00:00:49.472 --> 00:00:52.661\nI don't work with that same\nfile when I'm at home.\n\n18\n00:00:52.661 --> 00:00:57.130\nI don't have to put it on a thumb drive,\ncarry it home with me, make changes to it.\n\n19\n00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:00.122\nRemember to copy the new version\nback to the thumb drive.\n\n20\n00:01:00.122 --> 00:01:03.977\nBring it back to work, copy it over the\nfile server, replace the old version with\n\n21\n00:01:03.977 --> 00:01:05.797\nthe new version, wait, which one?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n22\n00:01:05.797 --> 00:01:08.119\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, not a lot of fun, right?\n\n23\n00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:10.315\nThis is that whole centralized storage,\n\n24\n00:01:10.315 --> 00:01:14.027\nexcept it's under corporate control\nrather than, say, OneDrive.\n\n25\n00:01:14.027 --> 00:01:16.243\nWhich I don't have as much control over.\n\n26\n00:01:16.243 --> 00:01:19.779\nAll right, so just, bleh, bleh,\nlet me learn how to talk and\n\n27\n00:01:19.779 --> 00:01:21.706\nwe'll join me here on my screen.\n\n28\n00:01:21.706 --> 00:01:25.094\nThank you, Aubrey, for\nunderstanding what I meant to say, and\n\n29\n00:01:25.094 --> 00:01:26.866\nright where we left off, right?\n\n30\n00:01:26.866 --> 00:01:32.538\nWhat I had done in a previous episode was\nI typed in my URL, I used HTTP, right?\n\n31\n00:01:32.538 --> 00:01:36.288\nI don't think I have,\nlet me see if I have, zoom it on here,\n\n32\n00:01:36.288 --> 00:01:38.841\nI do not, I can't zoom in, I used HTTP.\n\n33\n00:01:38.841 --> 00:01:42.260\nBecause this is just my demo,\nI didn't set up certificates and\n\n34\n00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:43.818\nassign an SSl certificate.\n\n35\n00:01:43.818 --> 00:01:46.593\nBut I forgot to do the registry\nentries on the home machine,\n\n36\n00:01:46.593 --> 00:01:49.360\nI did them on the work machine,\nbut not the home.\n\n37\n00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.715\nSo I told you I'd show you that anyway,\nso I brought over,\n\n38\n00:01:52.715 --> 00:01:56.770\nI couldn't find my little script,\nbut I grabbed my commands anyway.\n\n39\n00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.428\nAnd here they are, so what I will do\nis pop that over there, actually,\n\n40\n00:02:00.428 --> 00:02:04.100\nI'll just leave that over here, and\nwe'll open up a command prompt.\n\n41\n00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.116\nWe'll make sure that's\nan administrative command prompt,\n\n42\n00:02:08.116 --> 00:02:10.383\nbecause I am going to be\nmodifying the registry.\n\n43\n00:02:10.383 --> 00:02:14.882\nAnd I'm going to bump up that font\nse we can see that a wee bit easier.\n\n44\n00:02:14.882 --> 00:02:20.013\nA little 18, Lucidia, and of course,\nMike has to change his layout,\n\n45\n00:02:20.013 --> 00:02:24.743\nbecause I hate it when it starts\nwrapping on me, and that's okay.\n\n46\n00:02:24.743 --> 00:02:26.408\nI don't have to worry about\nit saved in the settings,\n\n47\n00:02:26.408 --> 00:02:28.260\nas long as we can use them for right now.\n\n48\n00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.766\nAll right, so\nlet's start with this first one in ox,\n\n49\n00:02:32.766 --> 00:02:35.795\nagain, don't.\n&gt;&gt; This is not part of\n\n50\n00:02:35.795 --> 00:02:38.547\na testable type question.\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\n\n51\n00:02:38.547 --> 00:02:41.790\nthis is a hack to make it work\nwithout issuing certificates.\n\n52\n00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.400\nThis is definitely not the way you\nshould answer the question on the exam.\n\n53\n00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.639\nI say hack, I'm going a little loose and\nfast with that term.\n\n54\n00:02:48.639 --> 00:02:50.286\n&gt;&gt; Well, any time you modify the registry,\n\n55\n00:02:50.286 --> 00:02:51.761\nit is a hack.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there you go.\n\n56\n00:02:51.761 --> 00:02:52.759\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n57\n00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:55.334\n&gt;&gt; But we're just making some changes so\n\n58\n00:02:55.334 --> 00:03:00.970\nthat, because by default it will always\nrequire HTTPS, and that's what we want.\n\n59\n00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.025\nWe don't want to change that, all right?\n\n60\n00:03:03.025 --> 00:03:05.340\nI'm doing this just for\ndemonstration purposes.\n\n61\n00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.665\nHere I'm just going into HKEY LOCAL\nMACHINE Software/MicrosoftWindows\n\n62\n00:03:08.665 --> 00:03:10.096\nCurrentVersion Workfolders.\n\n63\n00:03:10.096 --> 00:03:12.610\nAllow unsecure connection, and\n\n64\n00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:17.107\nI'm setting that to a value of\n1 to be true, so I hit Enter.\n\n65\n00:03:17.107 --> 00:03:19.000\nHopefully that completes successfully.\n\n66\n00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.230\nSo now it's going to say, okay,\nyou can use HTTP instead of HTTPS.\n\n67\n00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:28.165\nThe second one I'm going to do,\nI'm going to copy that, paste it in here,\n\n68\n00:03:28.165 --> 00:03:30.107\nhere's another one that's going.\n\n69\n00:03:30.107 --> 00:03:33.440\nThis one goes into\nHTTP CurrentUser Workfolders, and\n\n70\n00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:38.330\nit's creating a key called server url and\nit's placing this url in there.\n\n71\n00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:41.837\nNormally what would happen is your\nuser would type in their work email\n\n72\n00:03:41.837 --> 00:03:42.807\naddress, right?\n\n73\n00:03:42.807 --> 00:03:47.180\nTheir log on, Cherokee@ITPROTVdemo.com.\n\n74\n00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:50.955\nAnd what Workfolders will do,\nonce you type in that email address,\n\n75\n00:03:50.955 --> 00:03:53.018\nit's going to convert it into a url.\n\n76\n00:03:53.018 --> 00:03:55.842\nIt's going to remove the Cherokee@, and\n\n77\n00:03:55.842 --> 00:04:00.169\nit's going to add HTTPS calling\nforward slash, forward slash.\n\n78\n00:04:00.169 --> 00:04:02.051\nAnd then sync serve dot, and\n\n79\n00:04:02.051 --> 00:04:06.294\nyou'd have to create the appropriate\nDNS records and all that.\n\n80\n00:04:06.294 --> 00:04:08.596\nThis is just going say,\nhey, here's the url.\n\n81\n00:04:08.596 --> 00:04:11.946\nDon't bother trying to convert it or\ndo anything fancy, so\n\n82\n00:04:11.946 --> 00:04:13.896\nwe'll succeed there hopefully.\n\n83\n00:04:13.896 --> 00:04:17.111\nAnd then this is the one I was\ntelling you about that I'm just\n\n84\n00:04:17.111 --> 00:04:21.810\nchanging the poling interval, because\nby default, it's sent to ten minutes.\n\n85\n00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:22.614\nAnd in a demo,\n\n86\n00:04:22.614 --> 00:04:27.386\nI don't want to twiddle my thumbs for ten\nminutes to see the synchronization occur.\n\n87\n00:04:27.386 --> 00:04:30.704\nThis is in seconds, so\nI'm setting that down to 15 seconds.\n\n88\n00:04:30.704 --> 00:04:35.794\nObviously that would generate a lot\nof additional replication traffic.\n\n89\n00:04:35.794 --> 00:04:37.280\n&gt;&gt; If you really were synching.\n\n90\n00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.140\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, across hundreds of users, or\n\n91\n00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:41.424\nthousands of users,\nthat would not be good.\n\n92\n00:04:41.424 --> 00:04:44.820\nThe server would get bombarded\nwith requests to synch.\n\n93\n00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:49.347\nSo not something you do in a production\nenvironment, but for our demo,\n\n94\n00:04:49.347 --> 00:04:51.166\nit's exactly what we need.\n\n95\n00:04:51.166 --> 00:04:54.980\nSo all those succeeded, I should be good,\nand now right back to the wizard.\n\n96\n00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:58.371\nAgain, HTTP without the secure HTTPS, and\n\n97\n00:04:58.371 --> 00:05:04.068\nI might have to cancel out of this and\ntry that all over again, let's see.\n\n98\n00:05:04.068 --> 00:05:09.518\nI'm going to do a Workfolder,\n\n99\n00:05:09.518 --> 00:05:18.543\nURL instead, HTTP SVR01.ITPROTVdemo.com.\n\n100\n00:05:18.543 --> 00:05:21.630\nAnd it's not liking that for\nsome reason, interesting.\n\n101\n00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:23.819\nServer name or address cannot be resolved.\n\n102\n00:05:23.819 --> 00:05:27.501\nSo now I need to check my DNS, so\n\n103\n00:05:27.501 --> 00:05:32.049\nlet's find out, what do I need to do?\n\n104\n00:05:32.049 --> 00:05:35.601\nLets do a little IP config on this,\nno wonder,\n\n105\n00:05:35.601 --> 00:05:41.070\nhe's not even on the same network,\nso, again, using those errors, right?\n\n106\n00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:44.521\nThe first error was,\nyou can't do that in an insecure fashion.\n\n107\n00:05:44.521 --> 00:05:48.502\nModify the registry so\nnow I can do that, but\n\n108\n00:05:48.502 --> 00:05:55.180\nI still have a networking issue, so\nlet me change that settings for my VM.\n\n109\n00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:58.442\nLet me put it on the same\nnetwork as everybody else.\n\n110\n00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:03.622\nI must have changed that for another-\n&gt;&gt; Demo.\n\n111\n00:06:03.622 --> 00:06:04.940\n&gt;&gt; Demo, and you know what?\n\n112\n00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:08.126\nI cannot ever see\nthe bottom of this window.\n\n113\n00:06:08.126 --> 00:06:09.208\n&gt;&gt; When you're plugged in?\n\n114\n00:06:09.208 --> 00:06:11.230\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I'm going to have to kill my\n\n115\n00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:15.710\nscreen feed for a second to be able to\nclick OK to change those settings, so\n\n116\n00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:17.400\nbear with me as I undo that.\n\n117\n00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:27.522\nAnd then I will change that network\nadapter over to the right network,\n\n118\n00:06:27.522 --> 00:06:31.971\nall right, and I'll plug back in.\n\n119\n00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:41.182\nAnd we'll give that a minute to kick in,\nand let me make sure I get an IP address.\n\n120\n00:06:41.182 --> 00:06:47.200\nAnd you can bring the screenshare\nback now if you would like, Aubrey.\n\n121\n00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:53.688\nIt looks like I'm statically mapped,\nso let me change that real quick.\n\n122\n00:06:55.841 --> 00:07:00.048\nI should be able to pick up\nan IP address that's valid.\n\n123\n00:07:04.597 --> 00:07:07.735\nWell, I'm already set,\nso let's change that up.\n\n124\n00:07:14.031 --> 00:07:17.837\nAll right and\nwe'll try to renew real quick.\n\n125\n00:07:17.837 --> 00:07:20.704\nOtherwise I'll just go\nmodify the host file and\n\n126\n00:07:20.704 --> 00:07:23.721\nI'll put the darn IP address\nin there if I need to.\n\n127\n00:07:23.721 --> 00:07:30.116\nBut 10.10.8.64,\nis that valid on this network?\n\n128\n00:07:30.116 --> 00:07:33.399\nLet's see, ping SVR1 dot.\n\n129\n00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:43.343\nAll right, let's ping 10.0.100.101.\n\n130\n00:07:43.343 --> 00:07:47.719\nAll right, so I'm probably not using\nthe right server for DNS, again,\n\n131\n00:07:47.719 --> 00:07:49.570\nthis is a home machine.\n\n132\n00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:53.505\nAnd this is where setting up a little lab\nenvironment like this can get tricky.\n\n133\n00:07:53.505 --> 00:07:57.647\nTrying to simulate being\non a different network, but\n\n134\n00:07:57.647 --> 00:08:02.627\nname resolution is working, or\nI want name resolution to work.\n\n135\n00:08:02.627 --> 00:08:07.821\nSo let me just do this real quick,\n\n136\n00:08:07.821 --> 00:08:13.950\nlet's go into here, and ICANN IPv4,\n\n137\n00:08:19.921 --> 00:08:21.882\nAnd then see if that doesn't help things.\n\n138\n00:08:28.969 --> 00:08:31.109\nI didn't use the fully\nqualified domain name,\n\n139\n00:08:31.109 --> 00:08:32.940\nwhich is gonna cause problem with that.\n\n140\n00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:35.610\nThere we go.\n&gt;&gt; Cool.\n\n141\n00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:36.770\n&gt;&gt; Just cheating a little bit,\n\n142\n00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:38.350\ntrying to get this little lab to work.\n\n143\n00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:41.150\nSo we kinda forced it to do\n\n144\n00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:45.110\nsome name resolution there through\nthe DNS server for the company network.\n\n145\n00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:47.875\nThis is where I say, again, setting this\nup in the real world is something that you\n\n146\n00:08:47.875 --> 00:08:49.170\ngotta think about, right?\n\n147\n00:08:49.170 --> 00:08:52.400\nCan your users from home type in that URL,\nand\n\n148\n00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:57.178\nwill it be able to find your file\nserver at your corporate network?\n\n149\n00:08:57.178 --> 00:08:59.585\nThings you gotta deal with, all right?\n\n150\n00:08:59.585 --> 00:09:01.741\nSo fingers crossed, third time's a charm.\n\n151\n00:09:01.741 --> 00:09:06.790\nWe're gonna click Next, and\nthere we go, now we're working.\n\n152\n00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:10.070\nSo we've got an insecure connection,\nwe don't like that, but\n\n153\n00:09:10.070 --> 00:09:11.530\nthat's just for the lab.\n\n154\n00:09:11.530 --> 00:09:15.330\nNow I can find that URL\nis resolving properly, so\n\n155\n00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:16.770\nnow we need to authenticate, right?\n\n156\n00:09:16.770 --> 00:09:18.830\nBecause remember, I'm logged in,\nthis is a home computer,\n\n157\n00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:20.450\nI'm not logged in with my work account.\n\n158\n00:09:20.450 --> 00:09:22.808\nSo it's saying, who the heck are you?\n\n159\n00:09:22.808 --> 00:09:27.446\nAnd we'll do, oops,\n\n160\n00:09:27.446 --> 00:09:31.357\ndemo/cherokee.\n\n161\n00:09:34.754 --> 00:09:37.391\nAll right, and\nI know it's putting under Nate again,\n\n162\n00:09:37.391 --> 00:09:40.870\nthe local account that I'm logged on\nwith it happens to be named Nate.\n\n163\n00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:42.270\nBut we'll click Next.\n\n164\n00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:47.937\nI'll accept the policies,\nset up Work Folders, Agree.\n\n165\n00:09:50.890 --> 00:09:52.380\nAnd then close.\n\n166\n00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:54.770\nAnd the sync process begins,\nand there we go.\n\n167\n00:09:54.770 --> 00:09:59.310\nImmediately, don't rely on that, it might\nnot be immediate every time, right?\n\n168\n00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:01.730\nLittle test network,\neverything is nice and close.\n\n169\n00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:04.400\nBut there's that file that I\ncreated from that other machine.\n\n170\n00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:08.936\nSo imagine, here I am, I'm at home, it's\nthe evening, I'm doing a little work cuz\n\n171\n00:10:08.936 --> 00:10:11.043\nI'm a good employee.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n172\n00:10:11.043 --> 00:10:15.401\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna say, Mike was here, and\n\n173\n00:10:15.401 --> 00:10:21.222\nI'll save it, and\nI'll close it, all right?\n\n174\n00:10:21.222 --> 00:10:26.482\nAnd then I go into work the next day,\nand I log into my work machine,\n\n175\n00:10:30.818 --> 00:10:33.297\nAnd I've got a conflict\nhere on my Work Folders,\n\n176\n00:10:33.297 --> 00:10:35.040\nhow about that?\n&gt;&gt; Already?\n\n177\n00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:36.340\n&gt;&gt; Already.\n\n178\n00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:37.232\n&gt;&gt; That's because you're so efficient,\n\n179\n00:10:37.232 --> 00:10:38.496\nwe didn't even know you were\nworking behind the scenes.\n\n180\n00:10:38.496 --> 00:10:40.186\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, no file errors,\n\n181\n00:10:40.186 --> 00:10:44.840\nnot sure what the problem was with that,\neverything looks fine.\n\n182\n00:10:47.050 --> 00:10:48.830\nInteresting, not sure what the error was.\n\n183\n00:10:48.830 --> 00:10:50.370\nI'm gonna go and click Sync Now again.\n\n184\n00:10:50.370 --> 00:10:54.700\nI did up the polling interval,\nbut rather than wait 15 seconds,\n\n185\n00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:57.160\nI'm gonna make sure it's synced,\nand I'm gonna go to file it.\n\n186\n00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:01.740\nSo I've logged into my computer at work\nthe next day, I open up file explorer,\n\n187\n00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:05.380\nI go into Work Folders, I open up my file.\n\n188\n00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:08.710\nAnd there's the info that I was\nworking on from the night before\n\n189\n00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:10.260\nfrom my computer at home.\n\n190\n00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:11.890\nHow's that for cool, right?\n\n191\n00:11:11.890 --> 00:11:14.470\nThat's the idea behind Work Folders.\n\n192\n00:11:14.470 --> 00:11:19.080\nVery much like OneDrive, it's just instead\nof storing it on Microsoft servers, we\n\n193\n00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:23.430\nare storing it on corporate file servers,\nwhich gives us a little more control.\n\n194\n00:11:24.670 --> 00:11:28.618\nAll right, Cherokee, so\nI think that's good for Work Folders.\n\n195\n00:11:28.618 --> 00:11:32.640\nI should also mention that it's not\njust Windows devices with Work Folders.\n\n196\n00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:34.703\niOS devices, Android devices,\n\n197\n00:11:34.703 --> 00:11:38.710\nboth of them have a Work Folders app.\n&gt;&gt; That's right, they did expand on that.\n\n198\n00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:42.000\nIt started out with just Windows, and\nthen they got a lot of requests for\n\n199\n00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.664\nother devices.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely,\n\n200\n00:11:43.664 --> 00:11:45.851\nbecause Windows isn't\nthe only game in town.\n\n201\n00:11:45.851 --> 00:11:50.256\nAnd It's one of the things I really love\nabout the direction that Microsoft is\n\n202\n00:11:50.256 --> 00:11:52.152\ngoing in is it's not this whole,\n\n203\n00:11:52.152 --> 00:11:56.318\nyou've gotta use our stuff to access\nour features and things like that.\n\n204\n00:11:56.318 --> 00:12:00.160\nYou're seeing more and more and\nmore everybody just getting along.\n\n205\n00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:02.665\n&gt;&gt; They recognized value in adopting other\n\n206\n00:12:02.665 --> 00:12:05.840\nservices, they're allowing\nthat flexibility.\n\n207\n00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:06.590\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean,\n\n208\n00:12:06.590 --> 00:12:09.510\nI can go to a business and maybe say,\nyou really need to be running Windows, and\n\n209\n00:12:09.510 --> 00:12:12.320\nit is the desktop of choice\nin a Windows environment.\n\n210\n00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:15.896\nBut when it comes to a user's personal\ndevice that they're using at home,\n\n211\n00:12:15.896 --> 00:12:18.760\nthey might wanna use Apple or\nAndroid and things like that.\n\n212\n00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:22.893\nAnd so, yeah, if you're on Apple device,\ngo out to the Apple Store and look for\n\n213\n00:12:22.893 --> 00:12:24.078\nthe Work Folders app.\n\n214\n00:12:24.078 --> 00:12:27.806\nIf you're on Android, go into Google Play\nand search for the Work Folder app,\n\n215\n00:12:27.806 --> 00:12:31.050\ninstall those on your device and\nthen go through the setup process.\n\n216\n00:12:31.050 --> 00:12:34.620\nTry to open it up, authenticate,\nagree to the policy, and\n\n217\n00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:38.230\nnow you can access your Work Folders\nfrom those devices as well.\n\n218\n00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:39.230\nSo very, very cool.\n\n219\n00:12:40.530 --> 00:12:42.650\nAll right,\nlast thing I wanna talk about, well,\n\n220\n00:12:42.650 --> 00:12:47.880\nI think, we'll see how our time goes here,\nis something known as the Sync Center.\n\n221\n00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:52.111\nSo let me flip back over to, actually I'm\nall ready on my corporate device here.\n\n222\n00:12:52.111 --> 00:12:56.579\nAnd Sync Center is,\nlet's see if we can pull it up.\n\n223\n00:12:59.105 --> 00:13:00.490\nAnd nope, you can not.\n\n224\n00:13:00.490 --> 00:13:04.850\nSync Your Settings is not the same\nthing as the Sync Center.\n\n225\n00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:09.211\nSo what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go into\nControl Panel, and I'm gonna get rid\n\n226\n00:13:09.211 --> 00:13:13.659\nof this Category View cuz I can never\nremember what category anything is under.\n\n227\n00:13:13.659 --> 00:13:18.730\nI'm gonna change that to Icons,\nand there is my Sync Center.\n\n228\n00:13:18.730 --> 00:13:22.280\nSo this is the Sync Center,\nand the Sync Center is\n\n229\n00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:27.390\nwhere I can create relationships or\npartnerships, as they like to say.\n\n230\n00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:30.830\nI don't have Zoom It on here,\neither, great.\n\n231\n00:13:30.830 --> 00:13:32.530\nBetween file shares.\n\n232\n00:13:32.530 --> 00:13:34.730\nThis used to do a whole lot more.\n\n233\n00:13:34.730 --> 00:13:36.860\nSync Center's been around for a long time.\n\n234\n00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:41.170\nAnd it used to be how we would set up\npartnerships or relationships between,\n\n235\n00:13:41.170 --> 00:13:46.230\nI should say partnerships between,\nmp3 players, and phones.\n\n236\n00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:51.110\nAnd I can say, look, every time I plug\nin my phone, I want you to sync any new\n\n237\n00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:55.450\ncontacts that I might have picked up while\nI was traveling around with my computer,\n\n238\n00:13:55.450 --> 00:13:59.380\nand grab any photos off my phone,\nand bring them down to my computer.\n\n239\n00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:02.810\nAnd by the way, take this stuff off\nmy computer and put it on the phone.\n\n240\n00:14:02.810 --> 00:14:07.160\nYou create these relationships, so it knew\nwhat to sync between different devices.\n\n241\n00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:10.640\nAnd as soon as you plug the device in,\nit would do that same synchronization.\n\n242\n00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:15.571\nThere's other apps and other ways of doing\nthat now in Windows, so the Sync Center\n\n243\n00:14:15.571 --> 00:14:20.304\ndoesn't really perform that anymore,\nalthough all the stuff is still here.\n\n244\n00:14:20.304 --> 00:14:24.312\nI have tried to set up partnerships\nbetween devices, and I have yet\n\n245\n00:14:24.312 --> 00:14:28.120\nto get it to work,\nhaven't found a device it supports.\n\n246\n00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:30.970\nBut again, most smartphones,\nand things like that,\n\n247\n00:14:30.970 --> 00:14:35.080\nthey fall under the phone category,\nso you don't deal with them here.\n\n248\n00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:38.620\nBut what this does is Offline Files,\nright?\n\n249\n00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:41.680\nThis is where we're gonna\nmanage our offline files.\n\n250\n00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:47.150\nOffline Files are another way that\nwe can help support mobile devices.\n\n251\n00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:50.360\nMobile devices disconnect\nfrom our network, all right?\n\n252\n00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:54.970\nAnd when we look at things like managing\ninto Intune, right, it's because\n\n253\n00:14:54.970 --> 00:14:58.852\nthey're not part of my domain, and\nI can't apply Group Policy to them.\n\n254\n00:14:58.852 --> 00:15:01.860\nWell, we look at things like Work Folders\nit's because these mobile devices\n\n255\n00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:04.500\nare disconnected from the company network,\nand\n\n256\n00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:07.360\nI want to give them access to\nthese corporate resources.\n\n257\n00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:10.240\nWork Folders is another\nway we can do this.\n\n258\n00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:12.690\nWork Folders, I'm sorry,\nWork Folders, Sync Center and\n\n259\n00:15:12.690 --> 00:15:15.800\nOffline Files is another\nway that we can do this.\n\n260\n00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:21.860\nOffline Files are a way to\ncache copies of files locally\n\n261\n00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:27.140\non your device, right,\nfrom a share in a Windows network.\n\n262\n00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:32.640\nWhen I'm connected to the work network,\nI can type in a URL,\n\n263\n00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:37.810\na UNC path, Back slash back slash\nserver name, back slash share name.\n\n264\n00:15:37.810 --> 00:15:39.540\nAnd I can connect to that share.\n\n265\n00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:43.003\nAnd assuming I have the appropriate\npermissions, I can open up files and\n\n266\n00:15:43.003 --> 00:15:44.890\nmake changes to them and what have you.\n\n267\n00:15:44.890 --> 00:15:46.410\nWork with them, all good.\n\n268\n00:15:46.410 --> 00:15:49.201\nBut when I leave in the afternoon,\nand I go home,\n\n269\n00:15:49.201 --> 00:15:51.868\nI'm no longer connected\nto the work network.\n\n270\n00:15:51.868 --> 00:15:55.108\nAnd unless I VPN in, or direct access,\nor something like that,\n\n271\n00:15:55.108 --> 00:15:57.998\nI don't have access to that\nfile share anymore, right?\n\n272\n00:15:57.998 --> 00:16:00.031\nSo I can't work with those documents.\n\n273\n00:16:00.031 --> 00:16:04.172\nNow, I would like to copy one of those\ndocuments down to my machine, manually.\n\n274\n00:16:04.172 --> 00:16:08.357\nBut then I've got to remember to copy it\nback up there, we get versioning issues,\n\n275\n00:16:08.357 --> 00:16:09.400\nit's no fun at all.\n\n276\n00:16:10.730 --> 00:16:12.050\nOffline file says, you know what?\n\n277\n00:16:12.050 --> 00:16:16.860\nHow about I just sync a copy of\nthat file onto your machine?\n\n278\n00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:20.830\nAnd now when you're not connected, I'll\nlet you open up this synced copy, this\n\n279\n00:16:20.830 --> 00:16:25.160\ntemporary copy of the file, that you can\nwork with, just like you were connected.\n\n280\n00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:27.100\nThen when you connect back to the network,\n\n281\n00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:29.650\nI'll synchronize those changes\nwith the original document.\n\n282\n00:16:29.650 --> 00:16:33.202\nIt'll be like you were actually working\nwith the original document, facts.\n\n283\n00:16:33.202 --> 00:16:34.183\n&gt;&gt; Yay, I get to work on the weekend.\n\n284\n00:16:34.183 --> 00:16:35.874\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And the bosses are like,\n\n285\n00:16:35.874 --> 00:16:39.062\nyes I don't have to pay you and\nyou're getting work done,\n\n286\n00:16:39.062 --> 00:16:40.680\nisn't that great.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n287\n00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:42.020\n&gt;&gt; I know when it comes down to it,\n\n288\n00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:44.940\na lot of these do kind of make you think.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I know,\n\n289\n00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:47.855\nwhat have we done with our lives.\n&gt;&gt; They want me to work for\n\n290\n00:16:47.855 --> 00:16:50.220\n24/7 which we do, yes.\n\n291\n00:16:50.220 --> 00:16:52.950\nNo, it's all about making it easier for\n\n292\n00:16:52.950 --> 00:16:55.040\nthat end user,\nbecause it would allow me to.\n\n293\n00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:58.720\nMaybe I go in for an hour in the morning,\nand then I work from home for\n\n294\n00:16:58.720 --> 00:16:59.640\nthe rest of the day.\n\n295\n00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:01.770\nOr I'm traveling and\nI'm not connected to the network.\n\n296\n00:17:01.770 --> 00:17:06.510\nSo, [LAUGH] that's the idea there,\nthat's what Offline Files is all about.\n\n297\n00:17:06.510 --> 00:17:11.070\nSo, if I click Manage Offline Files, it's\ngonna open up my Offline Files dialog,\n\n298\n00:17:11.070 --> 00:17:15.930\nand the first thing I need to do is turn\nit on, cuz it is disabled by default.\n\n299\n00:17:15.930 --> 00:17:18.210\nSo I'll click Enable Offline Files.\n\n300\n00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:23.850\nAllows me to keep copies on your computer,\nthe file's stored on the network, and\n\n301\n00:17:23.850 --> 00:17:26.130\nthen I can work with them\nwhen I'm not connected.\n\n302\n00:17:28.100 --> 00:17:29.560\nAnd then I'll go ahead and click OK.\n\n303\n00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:32.440\nThere's a link to open up Sync Center,\nwhich if I do that,\n\n304\n00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:34.940\nwell, it's gonna take me\nright to where we are.\n\n305\n00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:39.450\nAnd I can management offline files again,\nand just end up in this endless loop of\n\n306\n00:17:39.450 --> 00:17:41.400\nthe two windows there.\n&gt;&gt; That's fun.\n\n307\n00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:42.740\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.\n\n308\n00:17:42.740 --> 00:17:45.780\nSo really not a lot to do here, because\nI don't have any partnerships set up,\n\n309\n00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:47.690\nI don't have any offline files yet.\n\n310\n00:17:47.690 --> 00:17:54.140\nAll I've done is turn it on, so, now what\nI want to do is navigate to a file share\n\n311\n00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:59.417\non my network, //sbr01 /corpdata.\n\n312\n00:17:59.417 --> 00:18:03.820\nAll right, and here's a file, now,\n\n313\n00:18:03.820 --> 00:18:08.290\nlet's talk about how we can make\nthis file available offline.\n\n314\n00:18:08.290 --> 00:18:15.640\nIf I right click on this file, you'll\nsee an option, always available offline.\n\n315\n00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:19.510\nAnd if I click that, actually I want\nto show you some other options.\n\n316\n00:18:19.510 --> 00:18:24.410\nIf I choose that, then it'll mark\nthis file as offline file, and\n\n317\n00:18:24.410 --> 00:18:28.650\nit will cache a copy of that\nfile locally on my machine.\n\n318\n00:18:28.650 --> 00:18:31.140\nAnd it will always be available offline.\n\n319\n00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:34.940\nI can also go up to my,\nwhere did they hide that now,\n\n320\n00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:40.980\nHome Menu, Home Ribbon,\nI think they're still calling it Ribbon.\n\n321\n00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:46.030\nAnd then Easy Access,\nI know it seems odd, but Easy Access.\n\n322\n00:18:46.030 --> 00:18:48.760\nAnd then there's the option\nAlways Available Offline, and\n\n323\n00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:51.970\nit's grayed out because I\ndon't have the file selected.\n\n324\n00:18:51.970 --> 00:18:58.370\nSo let me select that file,Home,\nEasy access, always available off-line.\n\n325\n00:18:58.370 --> 00:19:02.560\nI know it's a little small, but\nyou can see that little sync icon there.\n\n326\n00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:05.950\nSo either way, we can make it available,\nI'll go on and\n\n327\n00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:10.640\nclick this since I have\nthe menu pulled down.\n\n328\n00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:12.128\nAnd now, that file,\n\n329\n00:19:12.128 --> 00:19:16.780\nif I right-click on that file\nagain Should be available offline.\n\n330\n00:19:18.490 --> 00:19:22.480\nLet's see, let's go ahead and open it up,\nand we'll add some data in here or\n\n331\n00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:23.260\nsome text.\n\n332\n00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:31.450\nI'll just do my standard Mike was here,\nand let's save it and we'll close.\n\n333\n00:19:31.450 --> 00:19:34.370\nAll right,\nnow let's go back over to the Sync Center,\n\n334\n00:19:34.370 --> 00:19:36.530\nand see if anything has changed in here.\n\n335\n00:19:36.530 --> 00:19:41.455\nI don't think it has,\ncuz I don't have any partnerships.\n\n336\n00:19:43.510 --> 00:19:48.120\nAll right, I am surprised though\nthat my icon has not changed yet.\n\n337\n00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:51.820\nNormally I'll see a little Sync icon,\n\n338\n00:19:51.820 --> 00:19:55.450\nindicating that this\nis available off line.\n\n339\n00:19:55.450 --> 00:19:57.840\nSo let's find out if it\nis available offline.\n\n340\n00:19:57.840 --> 00:20:01.910\nI am going to disconnect from the network.\n\n341\n00:20:01.910 --> 00:20:05.350\nWe're gonna pretend that we're no\nlonger connected to the work network,\n\n342\n00:20:06.420 --> 00:20:07.855\nby turning off our network adapter.\n\n343\n00:20:10.270 --> 00:20:13.530\nI'm just gonna disable my network adapter,\nso\n\n344\n00:20:13.530 --> 00:20:15.110\nI'm no longer connected\nto the work network.\n\n345\n00:20:17.270 --> 00:20:21.040\nNow, I'm going to, and\nthis is another one that's,\n\n346\n00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:25.840\nwe do want to be cognizant of or\nwe want to think about.\n\n347\n00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:28.540\nHow do you connect to those offline files?\n\n348\n00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:31.909\nWell, yeah, let's just do it.\n\n349\n00:20:31.909 --> 00:20:36.402\nI'm gonna type in the URL, or I'm sorry,\nthe UNC path, server01corpdata.\n\n350\n00:20:36.402 --> 00:20:39.960\nAnd of course it's not actually working.\n\n351\n00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:42.250\nSo offline files is not working.\n\n352\n00:20:42.250 --> 00:20:47.490\nAnd that is why I did not get that,\nthis is telling me I can't connect\n\n353\n00:20:47.490 --> 00:20:52.500\nto work folders, because I disabled my\nnetwork adapter, that is not related.\n\n354\n00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:57.290\nAnd my offline files though, does not seem\nto be doing what it's supposed to do.\n\n355\n00:20:57.290 --> 00:21:01.930\nSo let's make sure,\nlet's do a little bit of troubleshooting.\n\n356\n00:21:01.930 --> 00:21:04.850\nI wanna go over to the server first, and\n\n357\n00:21:04.850 --> 00:21:06.720\njust make sure everything\nis set up properly there.\n\n358\n00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:13.260\nThis wouldn't be, probably wouldn't\nget you with this on the exam, but\n\n359\n00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:16.770\non the server is where\nthat share is located.\n\n360\n00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:23.120\nAnd if I pull up the properties for\nthat share, and\n\n361\n00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:27.940\nI take a look at my Advanced Sharing,\nand then caching.\n\n362\n00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:32.570\nSo only the files and\nprograms user specifies available offline.\n\n363\n00:21:32.570 --> 00:21:35.210\nSo, I just wanted to make\nsure it wasn't being blocked.\n\n364\n00:21:35.210 --> 00:21:39.300\nThe three options here, let me see if\nI can, I don't have zoom it on here.\n\n365\n00:21:39.300 --> 00:21:41.700\nThere's three options,\nthis is the server side.\n\n366\n00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:44.130\nBut the admin can decide,\nonly the files and\n\n367\n00:21:44.130 --> 00:21:48.560\nprograms the user specifies are available\noffline, that means I have to choose.\n\n368\n00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:51.980\nIf there were 30 files in that folder,\nI could pick and choose,\n\n369\n00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:53.820\nwhich files I wanted to\nmake available offline.\n\n370\n00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:56.540\nNot all 30 of them apply to me,\nI don't wanna work with all those,\n\n371\n00:21:56.540 --> 00:21:58.290\nI just want two of them.\n\n372\n00:21:58.290 --> 00:22:01.580\nNo files or programs from the shared\nfolder are available offline.\n\n373\n00:22:01.580 --> 00:22:06.640\nMaybe this is sensitive data and\nit's got PII, and HIPAA says I cannot\n\n374\n00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:11.420\nallow that to be synced onto devices,\nthat aren't contained within my network.\n\n375\n00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:14.430\nSo I don't want anybody making\nthese files available offline.\n\n376\n00:22:14.430 --> 00:22:17.130\nAdmin can block that, or\none way they can block that.\n\n377\n00:22:17.130 --> 00:22:20.850\nAnd then the last one, all files and\nprograms that the users open,\n\n378\n00:22:20.850 --> 00:22:23.700\nfrom the shared folder\nautomatically available offline.\n\n379\n00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:26.420\nThat means,\njust by opening up that text file,\n\n380\n00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:28.360\nit would flag it as\nmake available offline.\n\n381\n00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:32.170\nIt's saying, hey, he opened it, he must\nlike that document, or work with that\n\n382\n00:22:32.170 --> 00:22:35.075\ndocument, I'm going to go ahead and\nmake it available offline for him.\n\n383\n00:22:35.075 --> 00:22:36.810\nAnd it would do it automatically.\n\n384\n00:22:36.810 --> 00:22:39.730\nSo the server side of things, everything\nlooks good, we'll click okay and\n\n385\n00:22:39.730 --> 00:22:44.008\nback our way out of there,\nwe'll jump back over to the client,\n\n386\n00:22:44.008 --> 00:22:47.460\ncontinue our troubleshooting.\n\n387\n00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:52.910\nNetwork path was not found,\n\n388\n00:22:52.910 --> 00:22:56.675\nyou know that is\n&gt;&gt; They are still on the same network\n\n389\n00:22:56.675 --> 00:23:00.090\nthen?\n&gt;&gt; Yes, this, well this\n\n390\n00:23:00.090 --> 00:23:01.819\n&gt;&gt; Offline it doensn't even matter.\n\n391\n00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:05.599\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna go ahead and reconnect, and\n\n392\n00:23:05.599 --> 00:23:08.447\nwe will continue our troubleshooting.\n\n393\n00:23:10.890 --> 00:23:14.501\nJust turn this guy back on.\n\n394\n00:23:20.367 --> 00:23:24.384\nMake sure it picked up an address, there\nwe go, although it's client is public.\n\n395\n00:23:30.714 --> 00:23:32.760\nThat'll probably change\nin just a little bit.\n\n396\n00:23:33.910 --> 00:23:37.600\nThat shouldn't matter, it doesn't\nhave anything to do with the profile.\n\n397\n00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:40.530\nSo let me connect to that share again,\nserver1corpdata.\n\n398\n00:23:42.050 --> 00:23:46.072\nI see this file in here, I'm gonna\nright-click, always available offline,\n\n399\n00:23:46.072 --> 00:23:46.860\nthere it goes.\n\n400\n00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:50.843\nSomething was just hang up that first\ntime we were trying to enable it,\n\n401\n00:23:50.843 --> 00:23:52.814\nwho knows what was going on there?\n\n402\n00:23:52.814 --> 00:23:57.157\nBut that's what I wanted to share you\nearlier, and that's what you should see.\n\n403\n00:23:57.157 --> 00:24:01.253\nYou see that little green and\nyellow arrowed circle there?\n\n404\n00:24:01.253 --> 00:24:03.800\nThat is the same thing\nas a Sync Center icon.\n\n405\n00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:07.770\nAnd that's what's indicating that this\nis now an offline file, all right?\n\n406\n00:24:07.770 --> 00:24:09.110\nAnd you saw it sync.\n\n407\n00:24:09.110 --> 00:24:12.660\nIf we go back to the Control Panel, and\n\n408\n00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:18.240\nwe open up that Sync Center again,\nright there I can see my offline files.\n\n409\n00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:21.210\nLooks like everything is completed,\nlooking much better.\n\n410\n00:24:21.210 --> 00:24:26.600\nI can do a manual sync, I can also\nset up schedules for synchronization.\n\n411\n00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:31.030\nAll right, so now that it's synced,\nthat means I've got a cached copy,\n\n412\n00:24:31.030 --> 00:24:32.290\nI've got a copy local here.\n\n413\n00:24:32.290 --> 00:24:36.876\nLet's open this up, and I'm gonna say,\n\n414\n00:24:36.876 --> 00:24:42.250\nlet's type in while\nconnected to corp network,\n\n415\n00:24:42.250 --> 00:24:46.590\nor netrock, whatever I end up typing.\n\n416\n00:24:46.590 --> 00:24:51.510\nAll right, and we'll close it,\nand we'll save our changes.\n\n417\n00:24:51.510 --> 00:24:53.390\nNow let's disconnect from the network.\n\n418\n00:24:53.390 --> 00:24:56.857\nI'm gonna close File Explorer, and\nwe'll try this all over again.\n\n419\n00:24:56.857 --> 00:24:58.900\nI'm gonna pull up my network.\n\n420\n00:24:58.900 --> 00:25:03.690\nAgain, just trying to simulate me being\ndisconnected from the corporate network.\n\n421\n00:25:03.690 --> 00:25:04.320\nSo disable.\n\n422\n00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:09.740\nAnd now I'm gonna open up File Explorer,\nand\n\n423\n00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:14.640\nI'm gonna go up to my address bar and\nreconnect to that share.\n\n424\n00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:17.490\nAnd notice it connects,\nand there's the file.\n\n425\n00:25:17.490 --> 00:25:20.700\nAnd if I double-click on the file,\nit opens up.\n\n426\n00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:24.100\nBut wait a second, you can see the red x\ndown here in my system tray, if they move,\n\n427\n00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:24.701\nthere you go.\n\n428\n00:25:24.701 --> 00:25:27.790\nYou see that red x right there, right?\n\n429\n00:25:27.790 --> 00:25:31.630\nI am not connected to the network,\nyet, I was able to open this file up.\n\n430\n00:25:31.630 --> 00:25:33.687\nIt looks to the user like I'm connected.\n\n431\n00:25:33.687 --> 00:25:37.430\nAnd that's good, that's all I need to\nshow you down there in the corner.\n\n432\n00:25:37.430 --> 00:25:40.840\nAll right, and\nthat is how offline files work.\n\n433\n00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:45.130\nSo let's make sure we understand\na couple of things here.\n\n434\n00:25:45.130 --> 00:25:48.170\nCuz this is where I see people\ngetting confused with offline files.\n\n435\n00:25:48.170 --> 00:25:49.470\nHow do I find that file?\n\n436\n00:25:49.470 --> 00:25:52.110\nI made a bunch of files available for\n\n437\n00:25:52.110 --> 00:25:54.550\noffline files when I\nwas connected to work.\n\n438\n00:25:54.550 --> 00:25:57.120\nI got home, now, how do I connect to them?\n\n439\n00:25:57.120 --> 00:25:58.790\nI can't connect to the server.\n\n440\n00:25:58.790 --> 00:26:03.210\nMost people will say in their brain, I\ncan't type the UNC path in because I'm not\n\n441\n00:26:03.210 --> 00:26:07.825\nconnected to the network, so it doesn't\nmake any sense to type in //servername.\n\n442\n00:26:07.825 --> 00:26:10.420\nBut that's exactly how you do it.\n\n443\n00:26:10.420 --> 00:26:16.680\nWindows knows that you're offline,\nand when you type this UNC path in,\n\n444\n00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:21.050\nbefore it fails and says, network path\nnot found, it says, wait a second.\n\n445\n00:26:21.050 --> 00:26:24.280\nLet me check and see if they've made\nanything from that location available\n\n446\n00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:27.220\noffline, and if they have, it'll show you.\n\n447\n00:26:27.220 --> 00:26:30.290\nThere could be 30 files in that folder.\n\n448\n00:26:30.290 --> 00:26:32.083\nAnd when I'm connected to the work\nnetwork, I see all 30 of them.\n\n449\n00:26:32.083 --> 00:26:35.157\nI've only flagged one of\nthem available offline, so\n\n450\n00:26:35.157 --> 00:26:38.978\nwhen I go home and type in the same\nUNC path, I just see the one file,\n\n451\n00:26:38.978 --> 00:26:43.510\nI don't see the other 29 files\nbecause I'm not actually connected.\n\n452\n00:26:43.510 --> 00:26:47.860\nBut what I wanna try to stress to you is,\nyou connect to the offline version of\n\n453\n00:26:47.860 --> 00:26:52.530\nthe file the same way that you would\nif you were actually connected.\n\n454\n00:26:52.530 --> 00:26:56.560\nIf you normally type in a UNC path, type\nit in, even though you're not connected.\n\n455\n00:26:56.560 --> 00:26:59.680\nIf you use a mapped drive,\nconnect to your mapped drive, right?\n\n456\n00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:01.232\nYou're not gonna see everything,\n\n457\n00:27:01.232 --> 00:27:04.310\nyou're just gonna see the stuff\nthat has been synchronized.\n\n458\n00:27:04.310 --> 00:27:10.880\nIt actually stores the cached files in\na hidden folder called, I think, CRC.\n\n459\n00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:14.800\nIt's hidden on purpose,\nthey do not want you browsing directly and\n\n460\n00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:17.837\ndouble-clicking on those cached copies,\nright?\n\n461\n00:27:17.837 --> 00:27:22.060\nThat's an internal process that Windows\nis doing, and we should leave that alone.\n\n462\n00:27:22.060 --> 00:27:24.670\nWe just connect to it,\njust like I showed you here,\n\n463\n00:27:24.670 --> 00:27:28.630\nhow you normally connect to it, let\nWindows do its thing in the background.\n\n464\n00:27:28.630 --> 00:27:31.280\nSo while I'm not connected,\nI'm gonna open this up and\n\n465\n00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:37.230\nI'm gonna type in while not, Connected.\n\n466\n00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:43.020\nI'll save it,\nthen I'll close it, all right.\n\n467\n00:27:44.810 --> 00:27:48.880\nAnd now I'm going to reconnect\nto the corporate network.\n\n468\n00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:52.492\nSo it's like I went back to work,\nthey allowed me to come back.\n\n469\n00:27:52.492 --> 00:27:53.821\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n470\n00:27:53.821 --> 00:27:55.270\n&gt;&gt; I'm not fired yet, I don't think.\n\n471\n00:27:55.270 --> 00:27:56.191\n&gt;&gt; For now, yeah.\n\n472\n00:27:56.191 --> 00:27:57.784\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n473\n00:27:57.784 --> 00:28:00.924\nAll right, and\nI might have seen something,\n\n474\n00:28:00.924 --> 00:28:04.100\nI should have left my Sync Center open.\n\n475\n00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:07.430\nAs soon as you wake, basically what\nhappens is once you reconnect to\n\n476\n00:28:07.430 --> 00:28:10.440\nthe network,\nit's got all those changes cached.\n\n477\n00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:14.446\nAnything you worked on while you were\nnot connected is sitting there waiting.\n\n478\n00:28:14.446 --> 00:28:18.600\nAnd as soon as you reconnect,\nthe Sync Center is gonna say, all right,\n\n479\n00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:24.170\nwe're connected again, let me synchronize\nthose changes to the original documents.\n\n480\n00:28:24.170 --> 00:28:28.820\nSo now if I, let's in fact go back\nover to the server, not to the client.\n\n481\n00:28:28.820 --> 00:28:32.500\nLet's navigate to the server and\nopen that file up.\n\n482\n00:28:34.370 --> 00:28:39.540\nThat's on my C drive, and\nCorp Data, and there it is.\n\n483\n00:28:39.540 --> 00:28:42.200\nThose changes that I made\nwhile I was at home last night\n\n484\n00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:45.860\nhave automatically been synchronized\nwith the original document.\n\n485\n00:28:45.860 --> 00:28:47.513\nAnd that is offline files, and\n\n486\n00:28:47.513 --> 00:28:50.573\nyou can make as many files as\nyou want available offline.\n\n487\n00:28:50.573 --> 00:28:53.400\nI know we're getting short on time.\n\n488\n00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:56.550\nA couple of things to wrap up\noffline files and the Sync Center.\n\n489\n00:28:56.550 --> 00:29:02.500\nOne of the things we have to keep in mind\nis this doesn't do any kind of versioning.\n\n490\n00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:05.110\nSo it's important to\nunderstand the process and\n\n491\n00:29:05.110 --> 00:29:07.040\nwhen these changes\nare getting synchronized.\n\n492\n00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:13.510\nLet's say Cherokee and I both have\nthe same file marked as available offline.\n\n493\n00:29:13.510 --> 00:29:16.540\nSo when we leave,\nour machine reaches out and\n\n494\n00:29:16.540 --> 00:29:20.130\ncatches a copy of that file\non each one of our laptops.\n\n495\n00:29:20.130 --> 00:29:23.230\nWe both go home and\nmake changes to that document.\n\n496\n00:29:23.230 --> 00:29:25.390\nWhen we comeback tomorrow, Cherokee,\n\n497\n00:29:25.390 --> 00:29:29.260\nbeing the good employee that she is,\ngets here first and\n\n498\n00:29:29.260 --> 00:29:34.490\nimmediately the Sync Center synchronizes\nher changes with the original document.\n\n499\n00:29:34.490 --> 00:29:39.060\nAll is good, all her work she did last\nnight is now synchronized with the version\n\n500\n00:29:39.060 --> 00:29:42.990\nthat's hosted at the corporate network,\neverything's fantastic.\n\n501\n00:29:42.990 --> 00:29:46.816\nMike, being the lazy guy that he is,\nrolls in a little bit late.\n\n502\n00:29:46.816 --> 00:29:48.610\nI plug in to the network, and\n\n503\n00:29:48.610 --> 00:29:53.770\nmy computer tries to sync my changes\nthat I made to the document last night.\n\n504\n00:29:53.770 --> 00:29:55.910\nFirst thing that happens is\nthat my computer's gonna go,\n\n505\n00:29:55.910 --> 00:29:59.080\nwhoa, the file has changed.\n\n506\n00:29:59.080 --> 00:30:03.230\nIt remembers what the file looked\nwhen it synced it before I left.\n\n507\n00:30:03.230 --> 00:30:07.110\nWhen I came back in the next day and\nit goes to sync my changes, it says,\n\n508\n00:30:07.110 --> 00:30:09.660\nwait a second, that's not the same file.\n\n509\n00:30:09.660 --> 00:30:11.710\nAnd it's gonna prompt me, it's gonna say,\n\n510\n00:30:11.710 --> 00:30:15.290\nhey Mike,\nthe original file has been modified.\n\n511\n00:30:15.290 --> 00:30:20.050\nDo you want me to sync your changes\nwith the original file, overriding any\n\n512\n00:30:20.050 --> 00:30:22.550\nother changes that might have been made?\n&gt;&gt; None the wiser about\n\n513\n00:30:22.550 --> 00:30:24.880\nmy syncing that's already happened.\n&gt;&gt; Which is, yes,\n\n514\n00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:28.940\nthat would wipe out all of Cherokee's\nchanges would be lost, all right?\n\n515\n00:30:28.940 --> 00:30:32.960\nOr do you wanna save your changes as\na new document with a name like with\n\n516\n00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:35.670\nthe parenthesis two or\nsomething like that.\n\n517\n00:30:35.670 --> 00:30:40.120\nSo the problem is, it puts it in\nthe end users hands, that decision.\n\n518\n00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:43.850\nAnd if I am a jerk, I'd say,\nyeah, override the changes.\n\n519\n00:30:43.850 --> 00:30:44.494\n&gt;&gt; Make me look bad.\n\n520\n00:30:44.494 --> 00:30:45.902\n&gt;&gt; And then yeah, the boss says, Mike,\n\n521\n00:30:45.902 --> 00:30:47.210\nyou did great work last night.\n\n522\n00:30:47.210 --> 00:30:48.660\nCherokee, I don't know\nwhat happened to you.\n\n523\n00:30:48.660 --> 00:30:49.873\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH] what happened, Mike?\n\n524\n00:30:49.873 --> 00:30:50.918\n&gt;&gt; I asked you to do a little work, and\n\n525\n00:30:50.918 --> 00:30:51.826\nyou got nothing done, yeah.\n\n526\n00:30:51.826 --> 00:30:52.635\nAnd I'm like,\n\n527\n00:30:52.635 --> 00:30:55.390\nI don't know what's going on here.\n&gt;&gt; They did have a lot of\n\n528\n00:30:55.390 --> 00:30:56.180\ncomplaints about this.\n\n529\n00:30:56.180 --> 00:30:59.630\nIt's not the most intuitive\ncollaboration tool.\n\n530\n00:30:59.630 --> 00:31:02.440\nAnd that's why you do see other things,\nlike SharePoint and.\n\n531\n00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:03.510\n&gt;&gt; Yes, absolutely,\n\n532\n00:31:03.510 --> 00:31:08.630\nthis is very simplistic, again,\nthere's no versioning involved.\n\n533\n00:31:08.630 --> 00:31:12.510\nSo for simple file shares that\ndon't have a lot of collaboration,\n\n534\n00:31:12.510 --> 00:31:15.580\nyour personal stuff that you\nwork on when you're at work and\n\n535\n00:31:15.580 --> 00:31:19.890\nyou wanna be able to work with it when\nyou're at home or disconnected, fine.\n\n536\n00:31:19.890 --> 00:31:23.840\nIf it's a project that multiple\npeople are working on,\n\n537\n00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:26.130\nthis is not the solution for you, right?\n\n538\n00:31:26.130 --> 00:31:30.780\nOffline files is simply for\nstuff that only you work on,\n\n539\n00:31:30.780 --> 00:31:32.830\nreally, the majority of the time.\n\n540\n00:31:32.830 --> 00:31:35.520\nOtherwise you're gonna run\ninto issues because, again,\n\n541\n00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:37.900\nit leaves that decision\nin the end user's hand.\n\n542\n00:31:37.900 --> 00:31:41.620\nYou can also set up where it synchronizes\nautomatically when you log on or\n\n543\n00:31:41.620 --> 00:31:46.140\nlog off, which sounds good, but\nit can cause some big problems as well.\n\n544\n00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:50.520\nIf I've got hundreds of files\ncaching offline and I go to log out,\n\n545\n00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:53.781\nall of a sudden my computer's saying,\nsynchronizing files, right?\n\n546\n00:31:53.781 --> 00:31:55.060\n&gt;&gt; And you're like, I gotta go.\n\n547\n00:31:55.060 --> 00:31:57.070\n&gt;&gt; And I wanna shut my lid and run,\n\n548\n00:31:57.070 --> 00:31:59.920\nexactly, I'm gonna miss the bus,\nand I've gotta wait for\n\n549\n00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:01.710\nthis thing to stop synchronizing.\n\n550\n00:32:01.710 --> 00:32:05.670\nOr when I plug into the network\nin the morning, I log back in and\n\n551\n00:32:05.670 --> 00:32:07.000\nits doing its synchronization, and\n\n552\n00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:10.950\nI can't do anything else because it's\njust making my machine bog down.\n\n553\n00:32:10.950 --> 00:32:13.824\nSo there can be some issues there as well.\n\n554\n00:32:13.824 --> 00:32:16.363\nBut they do still call it out on the exam,\n\n555\n00:32:16.363 --> 00:32:21.390\nit is important that we understand what\nthose offline files are all about.\n\n556\n00:32:21.390 --> 00:32:23.840\nSo there you go, that is offline files.\n\n557\n00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:27.500\nUse them, understand their limitations.\n\n558\n00:32:27.500 --> 00:32:30.830\nI will say one more\nthing before we go here.\n\n559\n00:32:30.830 --> 00:32:35.320\nIt's not just, you can use this for more\nthan just the scenarios we just described.\n\n560\n00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:36.967\nThis is also handy for\n\n561\n00:32:36.967 --> 00:32:42.920\nusers on a branch office that have\nintermittent connectivity issues.\n\n562\n00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:44.740\nMaybe that link between\nthe branch office and\n\n563\n00:32:44.740 --> 00:32:48.420\nthe corporate office is not that reliable,\nit goes down now and again.\n\n564\n00:32:48.420 --> 00:32:51.823\nAnd my users at the branch office rely on\nthat connection because they're connecting\n\n565\n00:32:51.823 --> 00:32:54.528\nto shares back at the corporate office and\nworking with documents.\n\n566\n00:32:54.528 --> 00:32:57.904\nAnd if the connection goes down,\nthey could lose changes,\n\n567\n00:32:57.904 --> 00:33:00.720\nthey can't do work, things like that.\n\n568\n00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:04.850\nWe can enable offline files for\nthem, and they can sync those files.\n\n569\n00:33:04.850 --> 00:33:06.680\nAnd what will happen is,\nthey're working on a document,\n\n570\n00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:10.630\nthey're connected to a file share, they're\nworking on a document, everything's fine.\n\n571\n00:33:10.630 --> 00:33:15.950\nThe network goes down, Windows will\nimmediately kick over to offline mode and\n\n572\n00:33:15.950 --> 00:33:19.000\nlet them continue to\nwork with that document.\n\n573\n00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:21.360\nAnd then as soon as the network\ncomes up in the background,\n\n574\n00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:24.470\nit'll synchronize any changes\nback with the original document.\n\n575\n00:33:24.470 --> 00:33:27.500\nThey will see a little bit of a flash\ntelling them, hey, you're disconnected,\n\n576\n00:33:27.500 --> 00:33:29.250\nyou're working in offline mode.\n\n577\n00:33:29.250 --> 00:33:32.310\nWe can disable some of those prompts,\nbut it'll let them know and\n\n578\n00:33:32.310 --> 00:33:33.680\nthen it'll let them know\nwhen they're reconnected.\n\n579\n00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:38.750\nBut it is a way to allow users in\nlocations that have Internet connectivity\n\n580\n00:33:38.750 --> 00:33:47.210\nissues to be a little more productive or\neliminate that inconsistency with access.\n\n581\n00:33:47.210 --> 00:33:49.140\nSo it can help branch users as well.\n\n582\n00:33:49.140 --> 00:33:51.590\nBut again,\nkeep in mind there's still no versioning.\n\n583\n00:33:51.590 --> 00:33:55.545\nSo if five people out at the branch office\nare working with the same document,\n\n584\n00:33:55.545 --> 00:33:59.210\nthe network goes down, they are all\nnow working with cached copies.\n\n585\n00:33:59.210 --> 00:34:03.282\nNetwork comes up, they're gonna see some\nsync failures because it's gonna try to\n\n586\n00:34:03.282 --> 00:34:05.967\nsync all five of their changes and\nit's gonna be mess.\n\n587\n00:34:05.967 --> 00:34:09.065\nAnd that's when you have to go\non your Control Panel applet and\n\n588\n00:34:09.065 --> 00:34:12.670\ndecide what to do with those changes.\n&gt;&gt; Have fun with that,\n\n589\n00:34:12.670 --> 00:34:13.216\nMike.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, thanks.\n\n590\n00:34:13.216 --> 00:34:15.401\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No, but seriously, thank you for\n\n591\n00:34:15.401 --> 00:34:18.582\ntaking the time to show us how to go\nahead and complete that work folder and\n\n592\n00:34:18.582 --> 00:34:19.750\noffline configuration.\n\n593\n00:34:19.750 --> 00:34:22.132\nThank you for joining us as well,\nbut for now, let's sign out.\n\n594\n00:34:22.132 --> 00:34:24.970\nI've been your host, Cherokee Boose.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n595\n00:34:24.970 --> 00:34:26.080\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n596\n00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:33.459\n[MUSIC]\n\n597\n00:34:33.459 --> 00:34:36.715\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

And we gotta be able to pass this\n\n24\n00:00:53.193 --> 00:00:54.378\nexam as well, right?\n&gt;&gt; That's true.\n\n25\n00:00:54.378 --> 00:00:54.902\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\n\n26\n00:00:54.902 --> 00:00:59.561\nlet's talk about we're talking about\nthe 697, Configuring Windows Devices.\n\n27\n00:00:59.561 --> 00:01:04.133\nSo we're gonna talk about how do we\nconfigure our device to use DNS.\n\n28\n00:01:04.133 --> 00:01:06.126\nAnd let's just take a step back and\n\n29\n00:01:06.126 --> 00:01:11.190\nmake sure we're all on the same page when\nwe talk about DNS or Domain Name System.\n\n30\n00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:16.840\nThis is a service that our machines use\nto resolve names into IP addresses.\n\n31\n00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.291\nAnd to be more specific and correct,\n\n32\n00:01:19.291 --> 00:01:23.414\nwe would say fully qualified\ndomain names into IP addresses.\n\n33\n00:01:23.414 --> 00:01:26.753\nBecause remember, PCs, computers,\nthey don't connect to names.\n\n34\n00:01:26.753 --> 00:01:28.244\nThey don't understand names.\n\n35\n00:01:28.244 --> 00:01:32.371\nAll they know are 1s and 0s,\nand we use IP addresses.\n\n36\n00:01:32.371 --> 00:01:36.768\nWhen we talk about creating a socket, for\nexample, between me and that Web server.\n\n37\n00:01:36.768 --> 00:01:42.530\nWell, that socket is made up of protocol,\nIP, and port number, right?\n\n38\n00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:43.390\nThere's no name in there.\n\n39\n00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.361\nBut as humans, we like names, right?\n&gt;&gt; I don't know Mike.\n\n40\n00:01:46.361 --> 00:01:50.794\nI mean, I remember every single IP address\nfor every single website that I go to.\n\n41\n00:01:50.794 --> 00:01:51.500\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah,\n\n42\n00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.807\nyou're one of those savants?\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n43\n00:01:53.807 --> 00:01:55.110\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n44\n00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.427\nI mean, and we all know,\nwe go through this.\n\n45\n00:01:57.427 --> 00:02:01.270\nI don't even know my dad's phone number\nanymore because I can look him up in\n\n46\n00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.598\na list and touch Dad and\nit calls him, right?\n\n47\n00:02:03.598 --> 00:02:05.817\nAnd it's the same thing here,\nso yes, we like to use names.\n\n48\n00:02:05.817 --> 00:02:09.944\nCuz I can remember things like amazon.com,\nfacebook.com, google.com,\n\n49\n00:02:09.944 --> 00:02:11.328\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n50\n00:02:11.328 --> 00:02:13.576\nThose are easy to remember as a human.\n\n51\n00:02:13.576 --> 00:02:18.162\nBut if you told me that\nAmazon was 17.35.142.10,\n\n52\n00:02:18.162 --> 00:02:21.549\nif had to remember that,\nthat would be a pain.\n\n53\n00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:23.995\nAnd then what if Amazon change that?\n\n54\n00:02:23.995 --> 00:02:26.356\nNow they've got to let everyone know\nthat their IP address has changed.\n\n55\n00:02:26.356 --> 00:02:29.450\nSo DNS solves a lot of those problems.\n\n56\n00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:30.856\nWe can use friendly names.\n\n57\n00:02:30.856 --> 00:02:32.893\nThey get translated, or resolved,\n\n58\n00:02:32.893 --> 00:02:37.437\nin the background into an IP address that\nmy computer can use to actually connect.\n\n59\n00:02:37.437 --> 00:02:39.037\nAnd if you want more\ninformation about DNS.\n\n60\n00:02:39.037 --> 00:02:43.185\nMake sure you go check out our server\nclasses where we do talk about how DNS\n\n61\n00:02:43.185 --> 00:02:47.137\nworks in the distributed hierarchical\nsystem and things like that.\n\n62\n00:02:47.137 --> 00:02:50.672\nHere, we really wanna focus on how\ndo I make sure that my client is\n\n63\n00:02:50.672 --> 00:02:51.987\nconfigured properly?\n\n64\n00:02:51.987 --> 00:02:54.811\nCuz without DNS, Cherokee,\nwe're not doing a whole lot, are we?\n\n65\n00:02:54.811 --> 00:02:55.421\n&gt;&gt; No, I mean,\n\n66\n00:02:55.421 --> 00:02:58.755\nunless we know all those particular\nIP addresses and then you're set!\n\n67\n00:02:58.755 --> 00:03:00.638\nAnd you don't even need\nto watch this show.\n\n68\n00:03:00.638 --> 00:03:01.988\n&gt;&gt; Yeah so if you've got all them\n\n69\n00:03:01.988 --> 00:03:03.507\nmemorized, you're good to go.\n\n70\n00:03:03.507 --> 00:03:06.635\nBut everything we do it relies on DNS.\n\n71\n00:03:06.635 --> 00:03:11.046\nFrom the moment you walk up to your\ncomputer and you go to log in to work.\n\n72\n00:03:11.046 --> 00:03:15.350\nWell, your computer has to find the domain\ncontroller so you can be authenticated,\n\n73\n00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:16.876\nand it does that through DNS.\n\n74\n00:03:16.876 --> 00:03:21.292\nIt uses SRV records to find the IP address\nof the machine that's offering the logon\n\n75\n00:03:21.292 --> 00:03:24.307\nor the authentication service,\nand then it connects.\n\n76\n00:03:24.307 --> 00:03:28.047\nSo without DNS,\nyou can't even get past the logon screen.\n\n77\n00:03:28.047 --> 00:03:31.939\nAnd then everything you do,\nall the file shares you connect to,\n\n78\n00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:35.123\nall the other machines you\nmight have to connect to.\n\n79\n00:03:35.123 --> 00:03:40.586\nYour mapped drives, your cloud\nservice providers, your webpages.\n\n80\n00:03:40.586 --> 00:03:42.990\nAll of that relies on DNS.\n\n81\n00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:46.355\nSo just about everything we\ndo relies on this service.\n\n82\n00:03:46.355 --> 00:03:50.477\nSo making sure the client is configured\nproperly to use the right DNS servers,\n\n83\n00:03:50.477 --> 00:03:53.389\nthe ones that we want, is very important.\n&gt;&gt; For sure and\n\n84\n00:03:53.389 --> 00:03:57.401\nwe're not just talking about\nenterprise use, we're still using DNS.\n\n85\n00:03:57.401 --> 00:03:59.884\nEven if we don't have a DNS\nserver on our network,\n\n86\n00:03:59.884 --> 00:04:01.727\nwe're gonna be using it elsewhere.\n\n87\n00:04:01.727 --> 00:04:05.060\nMaybe from our Internet service\nprovider or something like that, but\n\n88\n00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:06.598\nit still exists.\n&gt;&gt; Exactly and\n\n89\n00:04:06.598 --> 00:04:08.514\nthat's a great starting point.\n\n90\n00:04:08.514 --> 00:04:11.861\nWe need, no matter what we're doing,\nwhether we are part of a work network or\n\n91\n00:04:11.861 --> 00:04:12.538\nhome network.\n\n92\n00:04:12.538 --> 00:04:16.721\nSitting at the Starbucks or\nsome other coffee shop, we need DNS.\n\n93\n00:04:16.721 --> 00:04:18.534\nAnd the way our machine connects to DNS,\n\n94\n00:04:18.534 --> 00:04:20.676\nthat's really what we're\nhere to talk about.\n\n95\n00:04:20.676 --> 00:04:25.333\nHow does my machine know how\nto find that DNS server?\n\n96\n00:04:25.333 --> 00:04:29.508\nAnd take that name that I've typed\ninto my browser and convert into and\n\n97\n00:04:29.508 --> 00:04:31.438\nIP address that it can connect?\n\n98\n00:04:31.438 --> 00:04:34.280\nAnd that's through our TCP/IP settings.\n\n99\n00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:38.013\nWhen we look at our TCP/IP settings,\nwe have several things we can configure.\n\n100\n00:04:38.013 --> 00:04:42.850\nWe have our IP address, our subnet mask,\nour default gateway, and our DNS server.\n\n101\n00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:45.269\nThese are the four big ones,\nthere's more, but\n\n102\n00:04:45.269 --> 00:04:48.465\nthose are the main configurations\nwe do within our IP settings.\n\n103\n00:04:48.465 --> 00:04:51.726\nSo it's in our IP settings\nthat we configure DNS.\n\n104\n00:04:51.726 --> 00:04:55.028\nAnd let's jump over here at my screen and\ntake a look.\n\n105\n00:04:55.028 --> 00:04:57.022\nSo I am on a Windows 10 box.\n\n106\n00:04:57.022 --> 00:04:59.319\n[COUGH] Excuse me.\n\n107\n00:04:59.319 --> 00:05:01.788\nAnd I'm gonna open up my network and\nInternet.\n\n108\n00:05:01.788 --> 00:05:06.109\nAnd I'm gonna head over to my Ethernet and\nfind my adapter.\n\n109\n00:05:06.109 --> 00:05:07.125\nAnd yes, or course,\n\n110\n00:05:07.125 --> 00:05:10.357\nthere are many different you can\ngo to get to places in Windows 10.\n\n111\n00:05:10.357 --> 00:05:15.150\nSo whatever your favorite way is to\nget to your network connections.\n\n112\n00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:18.630\nAnd I'm gonna pull up the properties for\nthis network adapter.\n\n113\n00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:22.871\nAnd on the Properties tab,\nI see this IP version 4.\n\n114\n00:05:22.871 --> 00:05:27.146\nAnd that's really what we're gonna focus\nin on here in this particular show,\n\n115\n00:05:27.146 --> 00:05:28.196\nis gonna be IPv4.\n\n116\n00:05:28.196 --> 00:05:30.184\nWhen I double-click on that,\n\n117\n00:05:30.184 --> 00:05:33.781\nI can see that it's set to\nuse the following IP address.\n\n118\n00:05:33.781 --> 00:05:37.940\nAnd then there's a bunch of numbers\nlisted here for IP address, subnet mask,\n\n119\n00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:40.840\ndefault gateway, and preferred DNS server.\n\n120\n00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:44.717\nSo let's first talk about\nthese two options here,\n\n121\n00:05:44.717 --> 00:05:49.868\nbecause this includes how I'm\nobtaining this DNS server address.\n\n122\n00:05:49.868 --> 00:05:52.083\nRight now it's what we\ncall statically mapped.\n\n123\n00:05:52.083 --> 00:05:56.056\nAnd that means that somebody has\ngone in and actually typed in.\n\n124\n00:05:56.056 --> 00:05:58.053\nIn fact,\nit was me earlier before the show.\n\n125\n00:05:58.053 --> 00:05:58.588\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n126\n00:05:58.588 --> 00:05:59.449\n&gt;&gt; I went in and\n\n127\n00:05:59.449 --> 00:06:02.213\ntyped in the number 8.8.8.8.\n\n128\n00:06:02.213 --> 00:06:06.705\nThat happens to be the IP address of a\npublicly available DNS server out there on\n\n129\n00:06:06.705 --> 00:06:07.598\nthe Internet.\n\n130\n00:06:07.598 --> 00:06:11.843\nI think that one's maintained\nby Google if I'm not mistaken.\n\n131\n00:06:11.843 --> 00:06:15.014\nSo I've told it,\nI come in here and I statically,\n\n132\n00:06:15.014 --> 00:06:19.102\nmanually assign the IP address\nthat I want this computer to use.\n\n133\n00:06:19.102 --> 00:06:22.510\nSo what that means is when it needs\nto resolve a name into an IP address.\n\n134\n00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:26.935\nWhether that's me logging on,\nwhether that's me visiting a webpage, or\n\n135\n00:06:26.935 --> 00:06:27.862\nwhat have you.\n\n136\n00:06:27.862 --> 00:06:31.127\nThis is the IP address that\nmy system is going to use.\n\n137\n00:06:31.127 --> 00:06:35.300\nIt's gonna talk to that DNS server and say\nhey, I need your help resolving his name\n\n138\n00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:37.801\ninto an IP address.\n&gt;&gt; Right, so you don't own that,\n\n139\n00:06:37.801 --> 00:06:39.588\nit's not your particular DNS server.\n\n140\n00:06:39.588 --> 00:06:42.630\nLike you said, it's Google's,\nand that one is easy to remember.\n\n141\n00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:45.810\nBut that's probably about one of\nthe few that I can actually remember.\n\n142\n00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:48.854\nBut anyways, so\nyou're still using DNS, right?\n\n143\n00:06:48.854 --> 00:06:52.636\nSo even though you don't have a DNS server\non your network, not everyone has to, but\n\n144\n00:06:52.636 --> 00:06:55.416\nit is an option.\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and it should be, let's see.\n\n145\n00:06:55.416 --> 00:06:58.446\nI haven't opened up the browser\non this machine since I set up.\n\n146\n00:06:58.446 --> 00:07:03.960\nSo I'm sure I have some crazy pages that\nMicrosoft is gonna want me to go to.\n\n147\n00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:07.559\nSo I just put in google.com,\nwe'll close some of this other stuff.\n\n148\n00:07:07.559 --> 00:07:11.193\nThere you can see I was\nable to get to google.com.\n\n149\n00:07:11.193 --> 00:07:11.861\nWhat's another one?\n\n150\n00:07:11.861 --> 00:07:14.238\nMaybe we wanna go to amazon.com.\n\n151\n00:07:14.238 --> 00:07:16.252\nSo I'm typing in these names and\n\n152\n00:07:16.252 --> 00:07:20.590\nmy system in the background is\nreaching out to that 8.8.8.8.\n\n153\n00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:23.426\nAnd saying hey,\nmy user just typed in amazon.com.\n\n154\n00:07:23.426 --> 00:07:24.158\n&gt;&gt; Where do I go?\n\n155\n00:07:24.158 --> 00:07:25.425\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, what the heck is\n\n156\n00:07:25.425 --> 00:07:27.430\nthe IP address for that Web server?\n\n157\n00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:30.919\nIt does all that in the background without\nus knowing it, and now there we go,\n\n158\n00:07:30.919 --> 00:07:32.999\nI'm at amazon.com.\n&gt;&gt; Ready to shop.\n\n159\n00:07:32.999 --> 00:07:35.237\n&gt;&gt; Ready to spend my hard earned money,\n\n160\n00:07:35.237 --> 00:07:36.050\nright?\n\n161\n00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:40.595\nSo one way we can set the DNS server\naddress on a client machine is statically.\n\n162\n00:07:40.595 --> 00:07:46.469\nBy opening up the TCP/IP properties and\nfilling it in, preferred DNS server.\n\n163\n00:07:46.469 --> 00:07:49.822\nNow I'm gonna probably jump out of\norder just a little bit here, Cherokee.\n\n164\n00:07:49.822 --> 00:07:54.657\nAnd why we're on this screen, I wanna go\nahead and talk about the preferred and\n\n165\n00:07:54.657 --> 00:07:57.305\nalternate, why we're here, all right?\n\n166\n00:07:57.305 --> 00:07:59.471\nBecause DNS is very important.\n\n167\n00:07:59.471 --> 00:08:04.048\nWe've decided and we've talked about\nthe fact that everything we do really\n\n168\n00:08:04.048 --> 00:08:08.567\nrelies On DNS, it's very rare that we\ndo anything by IP address directly.\n\n169\n00:08:08.567 --> 00:08:10.190\nSo DNS is important.\n\n170\n00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:14.520\nWell what do you think is gonna\nhappen if 8.8.8.8 is unavailable,\n\n171\n00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:15.490\nwhat happens to my system?\n\n172\n00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:17.317\nDo I connect to those webpages still?\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n173\n00:08:17.317 --> 00:08:20.862\nyou do have another line there available\nbut nothing's been configured, so\n\n174\n00:08:20.862 --> 00:08:22.998\nthe computer only does\nwhat it we tell it to do.\n\n175\n00:08:22.998 --> 00:08:27.517\nIt's going to check to say okay, this\nparticular DNS server can't be reached,\n\n176\n00:08:27.517 --> 00:08:29.269\nlet me try the next in line.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n177\n00:08:29.269 --> 00:08:30.216\n&gt;&gt; But there is no next in line.\n\n178\n00:08:30.216 --> 00:08:31.438\n&gt;&gt; There's no next in line, right.\n\n179\n00:08:31.438 --> 00:08:36.117\nIn fact if I made a mistake on this one,\nlet's go ahead and\n\n180\n00:08:36.117 --> 00:08:40.710\ntype in a bad IP address, and\nwe will get that to kick in.\n\n181\n00:08:40.710 --> 00:08:44.435\nI am gonna open up my browser.\n&gt;&gt; While we're shopping can we go to\n\n182\n00:08:44.435 --> 00:08:46.736\nZappos.com?\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, let's say Zappos.com.\n\n183\n00:08:46.736 --> 00:08:47.823\n&gt;&gt; All right, I need some new shoes.\n\n184\n00:08:47.823 --> 00:08:49.309\n&gt;&gt; Zappos.com.\n\n185\n00:08:51.527 --> 00:08:53.166\nAnd uh-oh.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n186\n00:08:53.166 --> 00:08:54.374\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's not looking good for\n\n187\n00:08:54.374 --> 00:08:56.230\nthe home team, is it?\n&gt;&gt; No shopping?\n\n188\n00:08:56.230 --> 00:08:58.290\nIt is not going anywhere.\n\n189\n00:08:58.290 --> 00:09:00.130\nCome on.\n&gt;&gt; But that's exactly what you expected to\n\n190\n00:09:00.130 --> 00:09:02.630\nhappen, right?\n&gt;&gt; Yes, this is what would happen.\n\n191\n00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:07.110\nIf you can't resolve that name, cuz again\na computer can't connect to zappos.com,\n\n192\n00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:08.450\nit needs the IP address.\n\n193\n00:09:08.450 --> 00:09:12.360\nSo without DNS it can't convert\nthe name into an IP address and\n\n194\n00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:14.140\nyou get nowhere, all right.\n\n195\n00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:17.794\nSo let's go back into our\nproperties talk about.\n\n196\n00:09:17.794 --> 00:09:20.510\n&gt;&gt; I do know another Google DNS IP but\n\n197\n00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:23.138\nI think it's 8.8.4.4.\n\n198\n00:09:23.138 --> 00:09:24.391\nI could be wrong, but\nI think that's another.\n\n199\n00:09:24.391 --> 00:09:27.940\n&gt;&gt; 8.8.4.4, well let's try and see.\n\n200\n00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:33.994\nSo now what I'm doing, right, is I've got\nmy preferred DNS server 8.8.8.115 but\n\n201\n00:09:33.994 --> 00:09:38.432\nI also have an alternate DNS server,\n8.8.4.4, all right?\n\n202\n00:09:38.432 --> 00:09:41.620\nLet's see if that helps.\n\n203\n00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:44.805\nWe know the first one is intentionally\nwrong so it's not gonna work.\n\n204\n00:09:44.805 --> 00:09:47.333\nLet's see if I can get to.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n205\n00:09:47.333 --> 00:09:51.651\nthis one could be wrong too but [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; Zappos.com.\n\n206\n00:09:51.651 --> 00:09:54.860\nAnd look at there,\nwe've made it out to Zappos.\n\n207\n00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:58.767\nAll right, so lets close that and\ngo back over to my ethernet and\n\n208\n00:09:58.767 --> 00:10:01.297\ntalk about what the heck happened here.\n\n209\n00:10:01.297 --> 00:10:06.043\nAll right, so the way this works is\nyou're, I listing two, my preferred and\n\n210\n00:10:06.043 --> 00:10:07.000\nmy alternate.\n\n211\n00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.490\nThe preferred is the one\nit's gonna try first.\n\n212\n00:10:09.490 --> 00:10:12.730\nAnd hopefully that will give me\nthat answer I'm looking for.\n\n213\n00:10:12.730 --> 00:10:16.820\n[COUGH] If the first one\ndoes not respond and\n\n214\n00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:19.900\nthere is an alternate DNS server\nconfigured, then my server,\n\n215\n00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:24.390\nmy client, will move on and say, all\nright, well, 8.8.8.115 is not responding.\n\n216\n00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:27.590\nLet me try 8.8.4.4, all right.\n\n217\n00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:29.480\nAnd if that one's responding, great.\n\n218\n00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:32.220\nIf not,\nwell I'm out of IP addresses to try.\n\n219\n00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:34.600\nYou don't get to go to Zappos.com.\n\n220\n00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:39.280\nHere is the key point I want\neverybody to take away though.\n\n221\n00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:42.070\nWhen I say that we'll use the alternate,\n\n222\n00:10:42.070 --> 00:10:45.770\nif the preferred DNS server\ndoes not respond, all right?\n\n223\n00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:46.946\nKeep that in mind.\n\n224\n00:10:46.946 --> 00:10:50.576\nIf the preferred DNS server responds and\nsays, hey,\n\n225\n00:10:50.576 --> 00:10:53.246\nthere is no such thing as zappos.com.\n\n226\n00:10:53.246 --> 00:10:56.622\nSo you don't get an IP address back, but\nit's not because the DNS server didn't\n\n227\n00:10:56.622 --> 00:11:00.060\nrespond, it's because the DNS server's\ntelling you that name doesn't exist.\n\n228\n00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:06.840\nI can't turn it into an IP address cuz\nthere's no such thing as zappomike.com.\n\n229\n00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:10.950\nIt will not move on to the alternate.\n\n230\n00:11:10.950 --> 00:11:13.399\nIf the first one tells it,\nhey that name doesn't exist,\n\n231\n00:11:13.399 --> 00:11:15.197\nit's not gonna move on to the second one.\n\n232\n00:11:15.197 --> 00:11:18.760\nThe only time it moves on is if\nthe first one doesn't respond.\n\n233\n00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:20.800\nThis has to do with the way DNS works and\n\n234\n00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:24.530\nit's covered a little more in detail in\nour server classes, so check those out.\n\n235\n00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:29.710\nBut basically all DNS servers, most of\nthem, I shouldn't say all, most of them,\n\n236\n00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:33.740\nthe way they're configured, they all have\naccess to the same set of information.\n\n237\n00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:38.724\nSo if one DNS server says, hey, I've gone\nthrough the steps, I've gone to the root,\n\n238\n00:11:38.724 --> 00:11:41.594\nand then the dot com and\nthen out to zappos.com and\n\n239\n00:11:41.594 --> 00:11:43.327\nthey say there is no, right?\n\n240\n00:11:43.327 --> 00:11:46.581\nThen any other DNS server is gonna\ngo through the same process and\n\n241\n00:11:46.581 --> 00:11:48.399\ncome up with the exact same answer.\n\n242\n00:11:48.399 --> 00:11:51.450\nSo there's no point in trying it again.\n\n243\n00:11:51.450 --> 00:11:55.500\nDNS will only move on to, the DNS client,\nwill only move on to the second or\n\n244\n00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:58.570\nthe alternate if the first\none doesn't respond at all.\n\n245\n00:11:58.570 --> 00:11:59.680\nIf the first one doesn't respond,\n\n246\n00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:04.240\nthen we say well he's not helping me,\nlet me try somebody else.\n\n247\n00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:06.640\nSo it's kind of like the whole mom and\ndad thing, right?\n\n248\n00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:09.137\nYou can ask mom something,\nand if she says no,\n\n249\n00:12:09.137 --> 00:12:12.738\nthere's no point in asking dad\nbecause he's gonna say no as well.\n\n250\n00:12:12.738 --> 00:12:16.060\nNow if mom's not around,\nyou can go ask dad, right?\n\n251\n00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:18.451\nAt least I hope that's way it works,\nI don't know.\n\n252\n00:12:18.451 --> 00:12:19.629\n&gt;&gt; That's really not how\n\n253\n00:12:19.629 --> 00:12:20.250\nit works.\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n254\n00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:20.867\n&gt;&gt; For kids.\n\n255\n00:12:20.867 --> 00:12:23.533\n&gt;&gt; If you can get to dad before mom's had\n\n256\n00:12:23.533 --> 00:12:27.324\na chance to tell dad the answer.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, that's how it works.\n\n257\n00:12:27.324 --> 00:12:27.824\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] DNS works, right.\n\n258\n00:12:27.824 --> 00:12:28.724\n&gt;&gt; DNS will only go to\n\n259\n00:12:28.724 --> 00:12:32.154\nthe alternate if the first one\ndoesn't respond at all, all right.\n\n260\n00:12:32.154 --> 00:12:32.664\n&gt;&gt; Now Mike,\n\n261\n00:12:32.664 --> 00:12:36.126\nyou brought up a really good point\nbecause you said hey from server side,\n\n262\n00:12:36.126 --> 00:12:39.662\nthings may be a little bit different.\nAnd that's really true because if you\n\n263\n00:12:39.662 --> 00:12:43.066\nguys have never really worked with\nservers before, and maybe that server is\n\n264\n00:12:43.066 --> 00:12:47.108\nfunctioning as a DNS server.\nIf you ever see the IP address there and\n\n265\n00:12:47.108 --> 00:12:50.731\nmaybe it just one and it says 127.0.0.1,\n\n266\n00:12:50.731 --> 00:12:55.535\nit's basically telling itself that,\nhey, I'm the DNS server for\n\n267\n00:12:55.535 --> 00:12:58.853\nthis internal network.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, good point Cherokee, let's go\n\n268\n00:12:58.853 --> 00:13:02.713\ntake a look at one of my servers here.\nIf we flip over to the domain controller\n\n269\n00:13:02.713 --> 00:13:07.516\nand we take a look, I'm just gonna use\na shortcut off server manager to jump\n\n270\n00:13:07.516 --> 00:13:11.419\nover to the TCP/IP settings\non my 2016 server, maybe.\n\n271\n00:13:11.419 --> 00:13:12.779\nNot much of a shortcut if you\n\n272\n00:13:12.779 --> 00:13:13.990\ndon't click on it.\n\n273\n00:13:13.990 --> 00:13:17.650\nAnd then I'll take a look at\nthe properties of my network adaptor,\n\n274\n00:13:17.650 --> 00:13:19.290\nwe'll go into ipv4.\n\n275\n00:13:19.290 --> 00:13:22.240\nAnd there we can see an example of\nwhat Cherokee was talking about.\n\n276\n00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:28.160\nBecause this server is also a DNS\nserver it's pointed to himself for DNS.\n\n277\n00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:30.758\nSo he actually still goes\nthrough the same process.\n\n278\n00:13:30.758 --> 00:13:35.580\nChecks his TCP/IP settings and then sends\na query to himself, so not the most common\n\n279\n00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:40.590\nthing, but definitely something you'll\nsee on your DNS servers for sure.\n\n280\n00:13:40.590 --> 00:13:42.595\nAll right let's go back over\nto this client then, so\n\n281\n00:13:42.595 --> 00:13:45.614\nwe were talking about alternates, I wanna\nshow you a couple more things here.\n\n282\n00:13:45.614 --> 00:13:49.178\nI'm gonna click on this advanced\nbutton down here right,\n\n283\n00:13:49.178 --> 00:13:51.630\nvery bottom of my DNS settings.\n\n284\n00:13:51.630 --> 00:13:55.817\nAnd when I click advanced, let me zoom\nback out, you'll see I have three tabs,\n\n285\n00:13:55.817 --> 00:13:58.568\nIP settings, DNS settings,\nand WIN settings, and\n\n286\n00:13:58.568 --> 00:14:00.774\nI wanna focus in on the DNS settings here.\n\n287\n00:14:00.774 --> 00:14:05.360\nThere's the two that I have listed\nalready, but notice I have add,\n\n288\n00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:09.465\nedit, and remove, and\nI've got these arrows over here, so\n\n289\n00:14:09.465 --> 00:14:14.040\nif I want this one to be tried\nfirst I can move it up in the list.\n\n290\n00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:17.367\nAgain keeping in mind that I'm only\nchanging the order that it's gonna\n\n291\n00:14:17.367 --> 00:14:21.302\nattempt, it's not gonna move to the second\none unless the first one does not respond\n\n292\n00:14:21.302 --> 00:14:22.078\nat all, right,\n\n293\n00:14:22.078 --> 00:14:25.484\nit's not setting up multiple places\nto ask only if it doesn't respond.\n\n294\n00:14:25.484 --> 00:14:32.372\nBut you can definitely control the order,\nand I can add as many as I want.\n\n295\n00:14:32.372 --> 00:14:34.920\n4.2.2.1 is a DNS server,\nI think Verizon or Sprint.\n\n296\n00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:36.770\nI can add that one in there.\n\n297\n00:14:36.770 --> 00:14:38.220\nGoogle has a whole bunch of them.\n\n298\n00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:39.883\nDon't they have like-\n&gt;&gt;

There's three in my list now and\n\n302\n00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:49.630\nwe can add as many as we wanted to.\n\n303\n00:14:49.630 --> 00:14:53.326\nBut again, people start adding a whole\nbunch in here because they think well if\n\n304\n00:14:53.326 --> 00:14:56.813\nI don't get the right answer,\nI'll go check with this other DNS server.\n\n305\n00:14:56.813 --> 00:15:01.430\nIt's only if one is not responding,\ndoes it move on to the next one.\n\n306\n00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:02.380\nAll right so\n\n307\n00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:06.450\nlet's there's some more advanced options\nhere that I definitely wanna go over.\n\n308\n00:15:06.450 --> 00:15:10.680\nBut before we do that let's get back\nto what we came in here to talk\n\n309\n00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:12.400\nabout initially with our TCP/IP settings,\n\n310\n00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:15.890\nand that was how I got this\naddress in the first place right?\n\n311\n00:15:15.890 --> 00:15:19.170\nAnd I'm gonna fix that just because\nthat's not even a valid DNS server, so\n\n312\n00:15:19.170 --> 00:15:22.250\nI'm gonna change that back to 8.8.8.8.\n\n313\n00:15:22.250 --> 00:15:27.724\nSo this is an example of us statically\nmapping this DNS server's address,\n\n314\n00:15:27.724 --> 00:15:30.396\nbut we also get it through DHCP.\n\n315\n00:15:30.396 --> 00:15:34.860\nAgain we've got a lot of great shows\nin our library that cover DHCP,\n\n316\n00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:37.470\nsetting it up, configuring the options.\n\n317\n00:15:37.470 --> 00:15:40.350\nBut at a minimum we should\nbe aware already that DHCP,\n\n318\n00:15:40.350 --> 00:15:44.460\ndynamic host configuration protocol,\nis a service we run on our network\n\n319\n00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:48.660\nthat will automate the assignment\nof TCP/IP settings, IP address,\n\n320\n00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:52.230\nsubnet mask, but\nit will also pass out DNS servers.\n\n321\n00:15:52.230 --> 00:15:55.510\nYeah so I can go to my DHCP server and\n\n322\n00:15:55.510 --> 00:16:01.406\nI can tell it what IP address to\ntell the clients to use for DNS.\n\n323\n00:16:01.406 --> 00:16:06.482\nSo rather than me having to come\nin here and type this information\n\n324\n00:16:06.482 --> 00:16:11.870\nin I can let it obtain it\nautomatically from DHCP, all right?\n\n325\n00:16:11.870 --> 00:16:14.710\nSo if I go ahead and\nclick OK and OK on that.\n\n326\n00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:18.731\nWe'll click OK here and\nOK here to apply all those changes.\n\n327\n00:16:18.731 --> 00:16:23.530\nWe'll give it kind of a second\nto figure out what it's doing.\n\n328\n00:16:23.530 --> 00:16:26.020\nAnd then I'm going to open up a command\nprompt just to kind of verify\n\n329\n00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:26.630\nsome settings.\n\n330\n00:16:26.630 --> 00:16:30.870\nIf we do a little IP config,\nI can see that I do have an IP address.\n\n331\n00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:32.144\nI'll zoom in here just a second.\n\n332\n00:16:32.144 --> 00:16:36.700\nIP config, switch all, all right?\n\n333\n00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:40.110\nSo here is my Ethernet adapter.\n\n334\n00:16:40.110 --> 00:16:44.370\nI can see I've got an IP address, and\n\n335\n00:16:44.370 --> 00:16:48.490\nI can scroll over slowly,\nthere is my DNS server IP address.\n\n336\n00:16:48.490 --> 00:16:53.446\nNot what we had manually typed in,\n8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4,\n\n337\n00:16:53.446 --> 00:16:55.470\nor something and all those, right?\n\n338\n00:16:55.470 --> 00:16:59.620\nThis one is getting, it's hollering out to\nthe network, hey, I need an IP address.\n\n339\n00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:01.980\nDHCP is giving it an IP address, and\n\n340\n00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:05.060\nit's saying, by the way,\nhere's a DNS server address.\n\n341\n00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:09.040\nYou might want this as well,\nwhich I most definitely do.\n\n342\n00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:12.620\nSo can I still connect to the Internet?\n\n343\n00:17:12.620 --> 00:17:13.670\nI know I can connect.\n\n344\n00:17:13.670 --> 00:17:15.620\nCan I resolve names out here?\n\n345\n00:17:15.620 --> 00:17:16.130\nWhere did we go?\n\n346\n00:17:16.130 --> 00:17:17.440\nZappos?\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n347\n00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:19.080\nwe might not want to pick that one.\n\n348\n00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:22.468\nIt might be in our cache.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we haven't talked about that yet,\n\n349\n00:17:22.468 --> 00:17:23.708\nbut-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n350\n00:17:23.708 --> 00:17:25.822\n&gt;&gt; What's some place I have not been yet?\n\n351\n00:17:25.822 --> 00:17:27.640\nNewegg.com.\n&gt;&gt; Ooh, yeah,\n\n352\n00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:28.861\nmore shopping.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n353\n00:17:28.861 --> 00:17:30.320\nwe love to shop today.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n354\n00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:31.170\n&gt;&gt; And there we go.\n\n355\n00:17:31.170 --> 00:17:32.570\nSo I'm still getting name resolution.\n\n356\n00:17:32.570 --> 00:17:34.410\nEverything is working just fine.\n\n357\n00:17:34.410 --> 00:17:38.550\nI'm just talking to\na different DNS server, right?\n\n358\n00:17:38.550 --> 00:17:41.410\nBut again, everything works the same.\n\n359\n00:17:41.410 --> 00:17:46.270\nSo as far as the actual configuration,\n\n360\n00:17:46.270 --> 00:17:50.400\nhow do I tell my client\nwhat DNS server to use?\n\n361\n00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:53.500\nEither let it obtain that information\nautomatically, and that means your server\n\n362\n00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:59.010\nadmins need to have set up DHCP properly,\nor you're gonna statically enter it.\n\n363\n00:17:59.010 --> 00:18:02.365\nAnd Cherokee, you had mentioned\nthe home front, and let's go ahead and\n\n364\n00:18:02.365 --> 00:18:04.570\ntalk about that just for\na quick second as well.\n\n365\n00:18:04.570 --> 00:18:06.120\nWhat am I doing at home?\n\n366\n00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:08.790\nI didn't statically map anything.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n367\n00:18:08.790 --> 00:18:10.210\n&gt;&gt; Yet, I'm still able to connect to\n\n368\n00:18:10.210 --> 00:18:12.360\nthe Internet.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I can shop on Zappos, too, Mike.\n\n369\n00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:14.400\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you can do that from home, right?\n\n370\n00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:14.900\nOf course we can.\nI\n\n371\n00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:17.460\nwant you to spend your\nmoney wherever you are.\n\n372\n00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:19.670\nAnd this main process is occurring.\n\n373\n00:18:19.670 --> 00:18:23.080\nIt's just now it's your ISP,\nyour Internet service provider.\n\n374\n00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:27.470\nSo Cox Communications or\nComcast or Brighthouse or\n\n375\n00:18:27.470 --> 00:18:32.690\nwhomever you're using to connect to the\nInternet, they're providing DHCP for you.\n\n376\n00:18:32.690 --> 00:18:36.680\nOr that little router that you\nhave sitting there in your house\n\n377\n00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:40.020\nto allow more than one computer\nto connect up to your network,\n\n378\n00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:43.185\nthat maybe that little wireless\naccess point that you're running.\n\n379\n00:18:43.185 --> 00:18:46.370\nIt's more than likely a combo\ndevice that's also doing,\n\n380\n00:18:46.370 --> 00:18:51.760\namongst other things DHCP and providing\nan IP address for you, all right?\n\n381\n00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:56.242\nSo automatic or manual, so\ndifferent ways we can get that IP address.\n\n382\n00:18:56.242 --> 00:18:58.470\n&gt;&gt; I always thought,\n\n383\n00:18:58.470 --> 00:19:00.885\nwhen I first started\nlearning about networking.\n\n384\n00:19:00.885 --> 00:19:02.255\nWell, I don't understand,\n\n385\n00:19:02.255 --> 00:19:07.565\nwhy do we need a DNS internally if DNS\nservers on the Internet already exist?\n\n386\n00:19:07.565 --> 00:19:09.255\nWhat's the purpose, what's the function?\n\n387\n00:19:09.255 --> 00:19:11.645\nCan we talk about that for a second?\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, and\n\n388\n00:19:11.645 --> 00:19:15.155\nit comes down to the way DNS is set up.\n\n389\n00:19:15.155 --> 00:19:17.725\nIt's a distributed hierarchical\n\n390\n00:19:17.725 --> 00:19:20.505\ndatabase, right?\n&gt;&gt; And to make it work, and to make it\n\n391\n00:19:20.505 --> 00:19:25.580\nscalable, and to make it as fast as it is,\nbecause it is lightning fast.\n\n392\n00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:29.420\nEven as big as the worldwide\nweb has gotten today, and\n\n393\n00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:33.710\nthe worldwide web could double\ntomorrow and DNS wouldn't hiccup.\n\n394\n00:19:33.710 --> 00:19:37.385\nIt wouldn't blink an eye at it most\n\n395\n00:19:37.385 --> 00:19:38.455\nlikely.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n396\n00:19:38.455 --> 00:19:40.199\n&gt;&gt; You never know, but\n\n397\n00:19:40.199 --> 00:19:42.870\nfor most things it wouldn't.\n\n398\n00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:46.530\nAt least for DNS, and\nthat's because the way it's setup.\n\n399\n00:19:46.530 --> 00:19:49.750\nAnd if I start,\nbasically to get back to your question.\n\n400\n00:19:50.910 --> 00:19:56.780\nEach organization is responsible for\ntheir own names and IP address mappings.\n\n401\n00:19:56.780 --> 00:20:02.750\nSo ITProTV here, we have a DNS server\nthat hosts all of our names and\n\n402\n00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:07.010\nIP addresses, so the names of my computers\nor my network and those IP addresses.\n\n403\n00:20:07.010 --> 00:20:11.550\nMicrosoft has their own DNS servers that\nknow the names of all their computers and\n\n404\n00:20:11.550 --> 00:20:12.550\ntheir IP addresses.\n\n405\n00:20:12.550 --> 00:20:14.600\nGoogle has their own DNS servers.\n\n406\n00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:18.210\nNow us, for example, we might\nmaintain those DNS servers ourselves.\n\n407\n00:20:18.210 --> 00:20:22.980\nWe might host it somewhere, like in AWS,\nor Azure, or something like that, but\n\n408\n00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:25.642\nwe are maintaining that name space.\n\n409\n00:20:25.642 --> 00:20:31.120\nAnd so what's a good way to say this?\n\n410\n00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:36.300\nReally, the idea is that I need to find\nthe DNS server that's responsible for\n\n411\n00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:38.300\nthat particular portion of the namespace.\n\n412\n00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:44.500\nIf I want to go to newegg.com, I need to\nsomehow find newegg.com's DNS server,\n\n413\n00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:50.100\nso that I can find what the IP\naddress is of newegg.com's web server.\n\n414\n00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:53.172\nThat's the basic process, and\n\n415\n00:20:53.172 --> 00:20:55.695\nthat's why you-\n&gt;&gt; It's more of that\n\n416\n00:20:55.695 --> 00:20:56.940\nresponsibility, right?\n\n417\n00:20:56.940 --> 00:21:00.380\nSo an enterprise being responsible for\nthat, that namespace like you're talking\n\n418\n00:21:00.380 --> 00:21:06.890\nabout and as maybe an end-user, a home\nuser, what are we really responsible for?\n\n419\n00:21:06.890 --> 00:21:11.110\nWe might have a couple of IP addresses\ndevices, but we're not running an entire\n\n420\n00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:12.600\ndomain, if you will.\n&gt;&gt; Right, but\n\n421\n00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:17.350\nyou still wanna connect to Amazon.com or\nFacebook or Zappos or Newegg or whatever,\n\n422\n00:21:17.350 --> 00:21:23.190\nwhich is why you need DNS or you need\nto be able to connect a DNS server.\n\n423\n00:21:23.190 --> 00:21:26.380\nAnd we'll talk more about it again when\nwe get into some of our server classes.\n\n424\n00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:30.802\nWe'll talk about the way it's distributed,\nthe way it's broken down with the root and\n\n425\n00:21:30.802 --> 00:21:34.213\nthe top-level domains and etc., etc.\n&gt;&gt; Probably more than you wanna know.\n\n426\n00:21:34.213 --> 00:21:35.574\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Man, I don't know.\n\n427\n00:21:35.574 --> 00:21:38.306\nI can talk about DNS for days.\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna say, because Mike goes\n\n428\n00:21:38.306 --> 00:21:41.480\nquite in depth for those shows.\n&gt;&gt; I do like some DNS.\n\n429\n00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:44.170\nBecause it really is\nthe backbone of everything else.\n\n430\n00:21:44.170 --> 00:21:46.905\nIt's what makes what we do possible,\nalmost.\n\n431\n00:21:46.905 --> 00:21:48.348\nOf course, there's some hardware and\n\n432\n00:21:48.348 --> 00:21:50.019\nthings like that that\nare just as important.\n\n433\n00:21:50.019 --> 00:21:52.782\nBut I do love my DNS.\n&gt;&gt; Core network service.\n\n434\n00:21:52.782 --> 00:21:53.965\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right, so\n\n435\n00:21:53.965 --> 00:21:56.480\nlet's see where I'm at here, Cherokee.\n\n436\n00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:59.000\nWe talked about what we need DNS for.\n\n437\n00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:02.250\nWe talked about where I can\nconfigure those settings\n\n438\n00:22:02.250 --> 00:22:05.500\nwithin my client operating system.\n\n439\n00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:09.150\nI do wanna talk about one.\n\n440\n00:22:09.150 --> 00:22:11.370\nWe mentioned fully qualified domain name.\n\n441\n00:22:11.370 --> 00:22:13.840\nSo let's make sure we define\nthat term real quick.\n\n442\n00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:18.321\nAn FQDN, or Fully Qualified Domain Name,\n\n443\n00:22:18.321 --> 00:22:22.683\nis basically your machine's full name.\n\n444\n00:22:22.683 --> 00:22:26.323\nI know that's kind of weird to\nthink about, but just like people,\n\n445\n00:22:26.323 --> 00:22:29.450\nwe have first names and\nwe have last names, or surnames.\n\n446\n00:22:29.450 --> 00:22:33.080\nAt least here in the US is the way\nwe do it, first name, last name.\n\n447\n00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:35.810\nAnd you can almost think\nabout it like that.\n\n448\n00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:37.800\n&gt;&gt; Like when your mother\n\n449\n00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:39.267\nis upset with you?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n450\n00:22:39.267 --> 00:22:42.857\nshe uses my fully qualified human name.\n&gt;&gt; Domain name, human name.\n\n451\n00:22:42.857 --> 00:22:43.718\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so\n\n452\n00:22:43.718 --> 00:22:48.497\nlet's say the reason why this\nhierarchical structure exists is because\n\n453\n00:22:48.497 --> 00:22:51.406\nthere's not enough unique names, right?\n\n454\n00:22:51.406 --> 00:22:53.431\nAnd we don't we want to get in.\n\n455\n00:22:53.431 --> 00:22:58.370\nNot for this test, I don't want worry\ntoo much about how DNS functions.\n\n456\n00:22:58.370 --> 00:23:01.650\nBut I do want you to understand that\nyou need a fully qualified domain name\n\n457\n00:23:01.650 --> 00:23:02.590\nto look it up.\n\n458\n00:23:02.590 --> 00:23:04.230\nAnd here is a really easy analogy.\n\n459\n00:23:04.230 --> 00:23:08.928\nLet's say you wanna call Bob Smith,\nor let's say you wanna call Bob.\n\n460\n00:23:08.928 --> 00:23:11.291\nSo you go to the phone book,\ncan you look up Bob?\n\n461\n00:23:11.291 --> 00:23:12.073\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n462\n00:23:12.073 --> 00:23:13.678\n&gt;&gt; No, you need a last name, right?\n\n463\n00:23:13.678 --> 00:23:14.777\n&gt;&gt; Who has a phone book, too?\n\n464\n00:23:14.777 --> 00:23:15.624\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I know.\n\n465\n00:23:15.624 --> 00:23:21.905\nThat's probably not the best analogy for\ntoday's day and age, I guess.\n\n466\n00:23:21.905 --> 00:23:26.169\nBut the point is is that if I\ncan't connect to server 1, or\n\n467\n00:23:26.169 --> 00:23:29.997\nweb server 2,\ncuz there could be 2, 3, 500,\n\n468\n00:23:29.997 --> 00:23:35.588\n5,000 machines out there on\nthe Internet named web server 2, right?\n\n469\n00:23:35.588 --> 00:23:40.846\nI wanna connect to web server\n2 that's part of Amazon.com,\n\n470\n00:23:40.846 --> 00:23:42.780\nright?\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n471\n00:23:42.780 --> 00:23:46.600\nwhat I need is that server's host name,\nwhich is server 2.\n\n472\n00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:52.070\nThat's the name you assign to your client\nmachine, like client 01 or Mike's laptop.\n\n473\n00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:56.263\nBut when you join that machine to\na domain, it takes the domain name and\n\n474\n00:23:56.263 --> 00:23:59.040\ntacks it on to the end of the host name.\n\n475\n00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:03.855\nSo if my laptop is named client 01,\nand I've joined the domain,\n\n476\n00:24:03.855 --> 00:24:07.720\nITPro.TV.\n&gt;&gt; We'll see that appended there, or\n\n477\n00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:11.984\nthat addition tacked on to the end,\n@amazon.com or\n\n478\n00:24:11.984 --> 00:24:14.510\nitprotv.com.\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so\n\n479\n00:24:14.510 --> 00:24:20.017\nmy fully qualified domain name\nbecomes client01.itpro.tv.\n\n480\n00:24:20.017 --> 00:24:22.690\nWe've taken them and\nput them together, right?\n\n481\n00:24:22.690 --> 00:24:28.760\nAnd that's important because when\nI go to resolve www.newegg.com,\n\n482\n00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:32.600\nI can't just ask DNS, hey,\nwhat is the address of www?\n\n483\n00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:35.160\nHow many www's are out there, right?\n\n484\n00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:39.030\nIt has no idea where to start to look for\nthat IP address.\n\n485\n00:24:39.030 --> 00:24:42.790\nBut if I type in www.newegg.com,\n\n486\n00:24:42.790 --> 00:24:46.990\nnow it knows the last name of\nthe server I'm trying to connect to.\n\n487\n00:24:46.990 --> 00:24:49.306\nIt knows exactly what\nDNS server to talk to.\n\n488\n00:24:49.306 --> 00:24:53.192\nYeah, I need to go talk to Newegg's DNS\nserver cuz this computer's last name is\n\n489\n00:24:53.192 --> 00:24:56.160\nnewegg.com, so Newegg must be\nthe ones that know about it.\n\n490\n00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:58.590\nTheir DNS server should know about it.\n\n491\n00:24:58.590 --> 00:25:04.981\nI can't connect to file server01 but\nI can connect to file server 01.ITPro.TV\n\n492\n00:25:04.981 --> 00:25:11.140\nbecause now I know what DNS server to go\nto to turn that name into an IP address.\n\n493\n00:25:11.140 --> 00:25:12.730\nSo I just wanted to\nrehash that real quick.\n\n494\n00:25:12.730 --> 00:25:16.310\nRemember, DNS deals in fully\nqualified domain names.\n\n495\n00:25:16.310 --> 00:25:20.490\nYou can't query DNS and say,\nhey, I want the number for Bob.\n\n496\n00:25:20.490 --> 00:25:22.400\nYou have to say Bob Smith, right?\n\n497\n00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:28.870\nI can't call up DNS and\nsay I need the IP address for DC01.\n\n498\n00:25:28.870 --> 00:25:32.740\nI need the IP address for DC01.ITPro.TV.\n\n499\n00:25:32.740 --> 00:25:33.820\nThat's what DNS does.\n\n500\n00:25:33.820 --> 00:25:38.405\nWithout the last part of the name,\nit's not gonna work out too well.\n\n501\n00:25:38.405 --> 00:25:41.766\nOur machines do have ways\nof dealing with it, though,\n\n502\n00:25:41.766 --> 00:25:44.318\nwhen we provide unqualified names.\n\n503\n00:25:44.318 --> 00:25:47.160\nCherokee, you're giving me\nthat sign that tells me that\n\n504\n00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:48.890\nit might be running close on time.\n\n505\n00:25:48.890 --> 00:25:52.040\nSo why don't we save that for part two?\n&gt;&gt; Sounds like a plan.\n\n506\n00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:55.170\nAll right, ladies and gentlemen,\nthank you so much for joining us today.\n\n507\n00:25:55.170 --> 00:25:57.160\nBut like Mike said, we are out of time.\n\n508\n00:25:57.160 --> 00:25:59.440\nSo let's go ahead and\ntable this for a part two.\n\n509\n00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:01.430\nFor now, we can sign out.\n\n510\n00:26:01.430 --> 00:26:03.770\nI've been your host, Cherokee Boose.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n511\n00:26:03.770 --> 00:26:06.118\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITPro.TV.\n\n512\n00:26:06.118 --> 00:26:11.910\n[MUSIC]\n\n513\n00:26:11.910 --> 00:26:15.251\nThank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

[MUSIC]\n\n3\n00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:13.268\nYou're watching ITProTV.\n&gt;&gt; Welcome everyone to your\n\n4\n00:00:13.268 --> 00:00:17.990\nConfiguring Windows Devices Series,\nstudying for that exam 70-697.\n\n5\n00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:20.390\nI'm your host Cherokee Booth.\n\n6\n00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:25.024\nIn this episode we'll continue taking a\nlook at how to configure IP settings, and\n\n7\n00:00:25.024 --> 00:00:28.717\nMike and I we had some arm wrestling\ncontests before the show, but\n\n8\n00:00:28.717 --> 00:00:33.240\nluckily I won and I was able to get him to\ncome back to finish up with that part two.\n\n9\n00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.260\nHow's it going today Mike?\n&gt;&gt; A little embarrassed that I lost but\n\n10\n00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:41.030\nback to talk about IP configuration,\nIP static, how about that.\n\n11\n00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.560\nYeah, we did leave off talking, we kind\nof left halfway through our discussion on\n\n12\n00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.910\nconfiguring DNS settings\non our client machines and\n\n13\n00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.750\nwe started talking about\nfully qualified domain names.\n\n14\n00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.830\nAnd we said how an FQDN is made out\nof your host name plugged together\n\n15\n00:00:55.830 --> 00:01:00.810\nwith your domain name, and that gives\nyou your fully qualified domain name.\n\n16\n00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.190\nAnd that's what allows\nme to resolve names.\n\n17\n00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:06.200\nI need that full name to\ngo look up an IP address,\n\n18\n00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.370\nbecause I have to figure out\nwhat DNS server to talk to.\n\n19\n00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:14.690\nAnd again we'll cover in our server\nclasses how we go about connecting to\n\n20\n00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:18.680\nthose, but for now, just understand that\nyou gotta talk to the right DNS server,\n\n21\n00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:19.860\nin order to find what you're looking for.\n\n22\n00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.020\nIf I talk to ITPro.TV 's DNS server,\n\n23\n00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.600\nit's not gonna know the IP\naddress of Google's web server.\n\n24\n00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.050\nBecause Google has their own\nDNS servers that maintain their\n\n25\n00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:32.730\nFQDN to IP address mappings.\n\n26\n00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:37.540\nAnd one of the most common\nDNS problems I think we have\n\n27\n00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.100\nat this level as a support technician or\na help desk, or\n\n28\n00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.700\nsupporting client operating\nsystems is just misconfigured DNS.\n\n29\n00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.602\nYou see this a lot when you're trying\nto join new machines to the domain.\n\n30\n00:01:50.602 --> 00:01:54.540\nBecause they need to be able to find,\nin order to join the domain,\n\n31\n00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.040\nI have to find the domain controller.\n\n32\n00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:58.560\nTo find the domain controller,\n\n33\n00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.680\nI have to be able to resolve the name of\nthe domain controller into an IP address.\n\n34\n00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.085\nThis means I need to be talking to\nthe right DNS server in the first place.\n\n35\n00:02:06.085 --> 00:02:08.915\n&gt;&gt; Right, and because humans can go ahead\n\n36\n00:02:08.915 --> 00:02:13.555\nand configure these settings, well, we all\nknow that humans can make mistakes, so\n\n37\n00:02:13.555 --> 00:02:15.915\nsometimes it happens.\n&gt;&gt; Typically by default,\n\n38\n00:02:15.915 --> 00:02:19.535\nyour client is configured to obtain\nan IP address automatically, and\n\n39\n00:02:19.535 --> 00:02:23.745\nif it connects after the Internet or\ngets an IP address from\n\n40\n00:02:23.745 --> 00:02:28.130\nsomebody other than maybe you're not\nrunning DHCP on your network, you expect\n\n41\n00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.370\neverything to be statically mapped, so\nit's not picking up that information.\n\n42\n00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.800\nSo let me show you an example here.\n\n43\n00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.110\nThis is the Windows 10 box we've\nbeen working with already.\n\n44\n00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.810\nIf I open up my browser,\nwe do have Internet access,\n\n45\n00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.780\nname resolution is occurring.\n\n46\n00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:47.999\nIf I open up my PowerShell prompt,\nwe can do a little IP configs switch all,\n\n47\n00:02:47.999 --> 00:02:52.835\nand I can see that I indeed have\nan IP address right up here,\n\n48\n00:02:52.835 --> 00:02:59.100\nthat I'm getting it through DHCP, so\nthis been assigned automatically.\n\n49\n00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:04.325\nAnd I can see my DNS Server is 10.10.8.2.\n\n50\n00:03:04.325 --> 00:03:08.110\nAll right, sounds good I'm gonna go and\njoin the domains.\n\n51\n00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:11.858\nSo this is just the way I like to get\nthere I know there is many different ways\n\n52\n00:03:11.858 --> 00:03:14.060\nyou can get to this screen.\n\n53\n00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:19.530\nAnd I'm going to change my settings and\nclick rename the computer.\n\n54\n00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.666\nWe've seen this, and\nI'm gonna join lab.itpro.tv.\n\n55\n00:03:25.342 --> 00:03:30.544\nAnd it says could not connect, or\ncould not, let me zoom it in and see\n\n56\n00:03:30.544 --> 00:03:33.482\nif I can read that a little bit better.\n\n57\n00:03:33.482 --> 00:03:33.985\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n\n58\n00:03:33.985 --> 00:03:35.148\n&gt;&gt; I was hoping it wasn't just\n\n59\n00:03:35.148 --> 00:03:38.123\nme because I'm, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] For the domain,\n\n60\n00:03:38.123 --> 00:03:41.846\nlab.itprotv could not be contacted.\nEnsure\n\n61\n00:03:41.846 --> 00:03:46.275\nthat the domain name is typed correctly.\nIf the name is correct, click details.\n\n62\n00:03:46.275 --> 00:03:50.640\nWell I know the name's correct,\nI click details, I come down here and\n\n63\n00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.750\nI can see DNS name does not exist.\n&gt;&gt; Hm.\n\n64\n00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:56.710\n&gt;&gt; So it was looking for the SRV record to\n\n65\n00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:02.240\ntry to find the domain controller for\nlabatitpro.tv and it was unsuccessful.\n\n66\n00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:08.670\nAnd that's because I'm not pointed to\nthe right DNS server in this case.\n\n67\n00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:11.370\nRemember I said the way DNS\nworks is you're gonna read, and\n\n68\n00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.800\nagain watch the server classes, but\nyou basically started the top and\n\n69\n00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:20.139\nyou work your way down looking for,\nin this case, lab.itpro.tv's DNS servers.\n\n70\n00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:23.050\nBut records like domain\ncontroller's IP addresses,\n\n71\n00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:26.600\nthose aren't going to be found on\npublicly available DNS servers.\n\n72\n00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.140\nThose would be hosted internal\nwithin the organization.\n\n73\n00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:31.470\n&gt;&gt; Yeah you gave an example like\n\n74\n00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:32.710\nthe phone book, right Mike?\n\n75\n00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:36.499\nSo that's going to be\nwhat's a good analogy?\n\n76\n00:04:36.499 --> 00:04:39.862\nSo the phone book has those public\nnumbers but maybe like internally,\n\n77\n00:04:39.862 --> 00:04:42.028\nwhoever's in my phone and\nmy contacts list,\n\n78\n00:04:42.028 --> 00:04:45.100\nthat's who we're really talking about.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah that's a great example.\n\n79\n00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:48.590\nI might be able to look up\ncompany xyz's phone number.\n\n80\n00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:50.890\nI'm going to give the phone\nnumber to the front desk.\n\n81\n00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:54.365\nBut can I find Sally's phone number in\n\n82\n00:04:54.365 --> 00:04:56.167\naccounting-\n&gt;&gt; Her extended-\n\n83\n00:04:56.167 --> 00:04:57.315\n&gt;&gt; Through the phone book and\n\n84\n00:04:57.315 --> 00:04:58.510\nher extension.\n\n85\n00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:59.350\nProbably not, right?\n\n86\n00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:01.220\nThey maintain an internal list.\n\n87\n00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:03.520\nPublicly they make their\nmain phone number available.\n\n88\n00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.300\nThey want everybody to be able to call in.\n\n89\n00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:09.750\nBut they don't want people maybe directly\ndialing in to internal employees.\n\n90\n00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:13.290\nAnd that's the same thing here,\nwe've got publicly available DNS records.\n\n91\n00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:17.330\nI want people to be able\nto come to ITPro.TV.\n\n92\n00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:21.500\nSo www.itpro.tv, things like that\nthose are publically available.\n\n93\n00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:25.040\nBut internally you don't need to know\nthe IP address of one of my domain\n\n94\n00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:30.010\ncontrollers, or one of my client machines,\nor my file server, or my printer.\n\n95\n00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:32.670\nYou don't have any business\nconnecting to those from the outside.\n\n96\n00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:33.540\n&gt;&gt; Right, from a security standpoint\n\n97\n00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:36.400\ndefinitely Mike.\n&gt;&gt; So when we look at our clients,\n\n98\n00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:40.570\nwe might have internet access because I\ncan go out there and open up google.com.\n\n99\n00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:42.850\nI can open up facebook.com, but yet\n\n100\n00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:46.900\nI'm unable to connect to the domain\ncontroller here on the network, and\n\n101\n00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:51.910\nthat's because my DNS server it's\nnot pointed to the right DNS server.\n\n102\n00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:55.590\nSo not only do we have to have a DNS\nserver's IP address configured,\n\n103\n00:05:55.590 --> 00:06:01.130\npreferably two DNS servers, that's\nthe bare minimum, because if one fails,\n\n104\n00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:04.130\nand you only have one listed-\n&gt;&gt; You mean it has to be right too?\n\n105\n00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:05.290\n&gt;&gt; I know, it's crazy right?\n\n106\n00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:06.230\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] How these things work.\n\n107\n00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:07.040\n&gt;&gt; Yeah but\n\n108\n00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:10.390\nimagine that if you only have one DNS\nserver's IP address listed in your client\n\n109\n00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:14.650\nsettings, and that DNS server for some\nreason is unavailable, everything stops.\n\n110\n00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:17.380\nThey can't authenticate, they can't\nconnect to resources, everything's done.\n\n111\n00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:19.880\nSo you need at least two in the list, and\n\n112\n00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:24.500\nthey should be the right DNS service for\nwhatever it is you are trying to do.\n\n113\n00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:30.470\nSo I'm gonna come in to my, I'm gonna\nhead over to my TCPIP properties,\n\n114\n00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:32.165\nand I'm gonna change it up a little bit.\n\n115\n00:06:32.165 --> 00:06:37.810\nGonna pull up properties for\nmy internet adapter,\n\n116\n00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:42.480\ngo on IPv4 and\nI'm gonna do this statically because my\n\n117\n00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:46.700\nnetwork is not running DHCP,\nas far as my domain goes.\n\n118\n00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:51.010\nSo I'm gonna give myself an IP address\nof just something I know that's unique.\n\n119\n00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:56.610\nAnd it doesn't really matter for\nthe default gateway in this case.\n\n120\n00:06:56.610 --> 00:07:01.385\nBut my DNS server is going\nto be the server for\n\n121\n00:07:01.385 --> 00:07:06.070\nlab.itpro.tv, their DNS server,\nwhich is 200, I believe.\n\n122\n00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:09.331\nGonna click OK and OK.\n\n123\n00:07:10.644 --> 00:07:13.320\nAnd we'll close that and that.\n\n124\n00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:17.040\nAnd now, let's see if I click\nchange settings, same window,\n\n125\n00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:19.186\nI'm going to rename this, or\nI'm going to join a domain.\n\n126\n00:07:19.186 --> 00:07:24.576\nGonna click domain, lab.itpro.tv.\n\n127\n00:07:26.526 --> 00:07:28.390\nAnd let's see what happens this time.\n\n128\n00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:33.760\nWe wait and wait and wait.\n&gt;&gt; So basically just to recap,\n\n129\n00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:37.360\nyou've actually configured it with\nthe correct information this time.\n\n130\n00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:40.720\n&gt;&gt; I did and looks like it's gonna force\n\n131\n00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:44.370\nme to go ahead of schedule and\ntalk about a couple of things.\n\n132\n00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:45.710\nIt's running really slow too.\n\n133\n00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:48.560\nAll right, so it's telling me,\nlet's troubleshoot this.\n\n134\n00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:54.649\nThat's what this class is for,\nit's telling me the operation timed out.\n\n135\n00:07:54.649 --> 00:07:59.348\nDNS server, computer's 10.10.8.200,\n\n136\n00:07:59.348 --> 00:08:02.769\nmaybe I didn't use that IP address.\n\n137\n00:08:02.769 --> 00:08:10.010\nIt's not 200, that's my fault,\nso let's try that again.\n\n138\n00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:15.130\nGood troubleshooting, if you give it\nthe wrong IP address it will not work.\n\n139\n00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:16.580\nSo let's go in and fix this,\n\n140\n00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:21.910\nEthernet, change adapter options, same\nplace going to go into those properties.\n\n141\n00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:26.627\nIP version 4 and he is actually 203.\n\n142\n00:08:28.612 --> 00:08:33.560\nWe'll close all that and we'll try\nthis third time is the charm, right?\n\n143\n00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:40.780\nWe're gonna click change and\nwe're gonna try to find lab.itpro.tv.\n\n144\n00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:41.880\nAnd look at there.\n\n145\n00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:44.600\nI don't have to go any further\nbecause I know now that I'm connected.\n\n146\n00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:45.610\n&gt;&gt; You're able to connect to it.\n\n147\n00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:46.650\n&gt;&gt; Because it's asking me for\n\n148\n00:08:46.650 --> 00:08:49.530\nit will prove to me you have\nthe right to join this domain\n\n149\n00:08:49.530 --> 00:08:50.780\nwhich means it definitely found it.\n\n150\n00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:55.090\nI'll go ahead and make it so number one.\n\n151\n00:08:56.910 --> 00:08:59.500\nJust so we can say we finished this up.\n\n152\n00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:03.960\nnone of that is important for\nwhat we're doing in here.\n\n153\n00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:07.530\nI'm just joining the domain,\nI know you've seen that in other shows.\n\n154\n00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:12.220\nSo while that's rebooting and\nfinalizing that domain, again,\n\n155\n00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:15.820\nI want you to understand that one\nof the most common things I see\n\n156\n00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:19.750\nat this level is just having the wrong\nIP address for your DNS server.\n\n157\n00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:21.850\nYou're unable to connect to\nthat domain controller, so\n\n158\n00:09:21.850 --> 00:09:24.060\nyou can't connect to resources internally.\n\n159\n00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:26.020\nAnd this is what throws people sometimes.\n\n160\n00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:30.440\nThey can still connect to Google,\nFacebook, but they can't connect and\n\n161\n00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:31.320\njoin the domain.\n\n162\n00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:32.270\nWhy?\n\n163\n00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:35.270\nAnd that's because you just\npointed to the wrong DNS server.\n\n164\n00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:41.770\nAll right, so let's talk next about.\n\n165\n00:09:41.770 --> 00:09:44.340\nWe talked about setting\nmultiple DNS servers.\n\n166\n00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:47.080\nTalk about that fully qualified\ndomain names, Cherokee.\n\n167\n00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:50.780\nLet's go down that road here.\n&gt;&gt; You mean the one that I get\n\n168\n00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:54.020\nyelled at if I'm misbehaving here.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n169\n00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:54.720\nThat's the one.\n\n170\n00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:56.490\nThat full name, right?\n\n171\n00:09:57.840 --> 00:09:59.080\nLet's do this.\n\n172\n00:09:59.080 --> 00:09:59.820\nLet's take a look here.\n\n173\n00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:03.720\nAnd I wanna type out, you know, again,\na fully qualified domain name will be\n\n174\n00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:10.620\nsomething like ClientO2.lab.itpro.tv,\nright?\n\n175\n00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:13.210\nSo here is the host name.\n\n176\n00:10:13.210 --> 00:10:17.370\nHere is the domain that\nthat machine belongs to.\n\n177\n00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:19.130\nPlug it together and\n\n178\n00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:24.130\nthat whole thing becomes what's known\nas the fully qualified domain name.\n\n179\n00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:29.150\nAll right, now, when we talk about DNS,\nin fact I'm gonna jump.\n\n180\n00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:31.020\nLet me see if my machine is back up.\n\n181\n00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:32.610\nLet's go back in here.\n\n182\n00:10:32.610 --> 00:10:37.140\nWe still have a few more\nsettings to look at.\n\n183\n00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:42.000\nAll right, so let me type in my\npassword here, if I got that right.\n\n184\n00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.670\nIt logged on.\n\n185\n00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:50.091\nAnd we open up those TCP/IP settings\nagain, For my ethernet adapter.\n\n186\n00:10:52.691 --> 00:10:54.955\nEventually, whoops, we'll get there.\n\n187\n00:10:57.731 --> 00:10:59.659\nThere we go.\n\n188\n00:10:59.659 --> 00:11:04.120\nJust setup this Windows 10 machine, so\nit's got all kinds of things popping up.\n\n189\n00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:07.120\nIt wants Cortana to get started and\nall that fun stuff.\n\n190\n00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:08.820\nWe'll just ignore that for now.\n\n191\n00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:12.470\nAll right.\nSo back into those IPV4 settings, and\n\n192\n00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:15.280\nI said I wanted to show you a few\nmore things on this advanced\n\n193\n00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:19.770\nTCPIP setting screen and a couple\nmore concepts I want to talk about.\n\n194\n00:11:19.770 --> 00:11:23.330\nLet's zoom in here and\nI don't have Zoomit it running so\n\n195\n00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:27.410\nlet me real quick fire that up for\nyou guys.\n\n196\n00:11:27.410 --> 00:11:32.435\nThis was just a little tool that\nallows you, allows me to zoom in.\n\n197\n00:11:32.435 --> 00:11:36.775\nSo that you can see what I am doing.\n&gt;&gt; Super helpful.\n\n198\n00:11:36.775 --> 00:11:41.035\nIt's helpful for a vision impaired folks.\n&gt;&gt; It is a little small on the screen.\n\n199\n00:11:41.035 --> 00:11:41.875\nSo there we go.\n\n200\n00:11:41.875 --> 00:11:42.955\nThat'll help.\n\n201\n00:11:42.955 --> 00:11:45.115\nAlright, so we're talking\nabout these advanced settings.\n\n202\n00:11:45.115 --> 00:11:47.285\nAnd I wanna talk about these right here.\n\n203\n00:11:47.285 --> 00:11:51.140\nAppend primary and\nconnection specific DNS suffixes.\n\n204\n00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:54.360\nAppend parent suffixes of\nthe primary DNS suffix.\n\n205\n00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:57.210\nBecause remember I was saying\nthat in order to use DNS\n\n206\n00:11:57.210 --> 00:11:59.510\nwe really need a fully\nqualified domain name.\n\n207\n00:11:59.510 --> 00:12:01.950\nYou have to type in the first name and\nthe last name, right?\n\n208\n00:12:01.950 --> 00:12:02.780\nYou can't just look up Bob.\n\n209\n00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:04.110\nYou got to look up Bob Smith.\n\n210\n00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:05.740\nYou can't just connect to www.\n\n211\n00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:09.070\nYou need to connect to www.something.\n\n212\n00:12:09.070 --> 00:12:10.580\nWe need that last name.\n\n213\n00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:13.450\nAnd I need to find that DNS server\nthat's responsible for that.\n\n214\n00:12:13.450 --> 00:12:15.250\nSo I need that full name.\n\n215\n00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:20.360\nWell this is one of the ways that Windows\ntries to help us when we use what's called\n\n216\n00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:22.130\nunqualified domain names.\n\n217\n00:12:22.130 --> 00:12:28.060\nIn other words,\nwe've typed in file01 or server3.\n\n218\n00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:31.940\nWe didn't do the .itpro.tv.\n\n219\n00:12:31.940 --> 00:12:35.770\nAppend primary and\nconnection specific DNS suffixes.\n\n220\n00:12:35.770 --> 00:12:42.120\nWell, my primary DNA suffix for this\nclient machine is the domain I blunt to.\n\n221\n00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:45.320\nRemember, my client's name is now and\nlet's take a look at this.\n\n222\n00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:48.720\nLet me pull up a command prompt.\n\n223\n00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:50.120\nAnd I apologize again.\n\n224\n00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:56.390\nI've gotta set some font sizes, so\nyou can see what's going on here.\n\n225\n00:12:56.390 --> 00:12:59.370\nThat's should be, oops, that is not it.\n\n226\n00:12:59.370 --> 00:13:00.580\nTry that one more time.\n\n227\n00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:03.150\nLet's do Font and we'll go size 18.\n\n228\n00:13:03.150 --> 00:13:06.040\nAnd let's change that layout a little bit,\n\n229\n00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:09.860\nso we can keep it all in one\nscreen without having to scroll.\n\n230\n00:13:11.030 --> 00:13:13.440\nWe'll do that and that should be good.\n\n231\n00:13:14.490 --> 00:13:20.390\nIf I type in host name I'll see that\nmy host name is actually client 03.\n\n232\n00:13:20.390 --> 00:13:27.320\nBut if I do an ip config switch all, I'll\nsee that my host name is client 03 but\n\n233\n00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:32.630\nmy primary DNS suffix is lab.itpro.tv.\n\n234\n00:13:32.630 --> 00:13:37.110\nMy fully qualified domain name\nis client03.lab.itpro.tv.\n\n235\n00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:44.180\nAnd what this means, when it's saying\nthat it will append primary, see that?\n\n236\n00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:48.210\nWait primary DNS suffix right?\n\n237\n00:13:48.210 --> 00:13:54.360\nAnd then over here append primary and\nconnection specific DNS suffixes.\n\n238\n00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:59.050\nSo what this means is Windows is going to\nassume that most of the resources you try\n\n239\n00:13:59.050 --> 00:14:03.390\nto connect to are going to be on the same\ndomain as you or part of the same domain.\n\n240\n00:14:03.390 --> 00:14:07.750\nIf I'm going outside,\nI'm typing in www.newegg.com.\n\n241\n00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:11.300\nI'm typing in www.0365.whatever.\n\n242\n00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:13.910\nWe're using fully qualified domain names.\n\n243\n00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:17.370\nBut internally I'm typing file 01 or\nserver three, so\n\n244\n00:14:17.370 --> 00:14:19.100\nI can connect to that share.\n\n245\n00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:21.180\nAnd what Windows is gonna do it's\ngonna say all right you gave me\n\n246\n00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:22.500\npart of the name.\n\n247\n00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:23.702\nWhat am I going to do for\nthe rest of the name?\n\n248\n00:14:23.702 --> 00:14:28.260\nBecause even internally I still need the\nfully qualified domain name to use DNS.\n\n249\n00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:31.090\nWell it's gonna say that since most\nof the things you tried to connect to\n\n250\n00:14:31.090 --> 00:14:35.290\nare in the same domain as you I'm going\nto use whatever your DNS suffix is for\n\n251\n00:14:35.290 --> 00:14:39.100\nyour machine and I'm going to plug\nit on to whatever you've typed in.\n\n252\n00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:44.480\nSo if I typed in, because my\nprimary DNS suffix is lab.itpro.tv.\n\n253\n00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:51.425\nIf I type in server 4 it's gonna assume\nthat I want server 4.lab.itpro.tv.\n\n254\n00:14:51.425 --> 00:14:56.165\nIf I type in file 02 it's gonna try\nto find file 02.lab.itproto.tv.\n\n255\n00:14:56.165 --> 00:14:58.325\nIt has to make some assumptions, right?\n\n256\n00:14:58.325 --> 00:15:02.165\nBecause I didn't provide\nthe full name it's going to\n\n257\n00:15:02.165 --> 00:15:04.685\nguess at what the full name is.\n\n258\n00:15:04.685 --> 00:15:06.165\nAnd that's what this means here.\n\n259\n00:15:06.165 --> 00:15:07.645\nAppend primary.\n\n260\n00:15:07.645 --> 00:15:12.960\nEach network adapter that you\nhave in your machine actually has\n\n261\n00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:15.760\na place to type in a DNS suffix for\nthis connection.\n\n262\n00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:16.785\nThat's what this part means,\n\n263\n00:15:16.785 --> 00:15:20.820\nconnection specific DNS\nsuffixes would come from this.\n\n264\n00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:24.480\nI don't have one configured but\nlet's say I did.\n\n265\n00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:29.505\nMaybe we've got two domains on my network\nand I connect to a lot of resources\n\n266\n00:15:29.505 --> 00:15:34.549\nthat end in contoso.com\nlike serveronecontoso.com,\n\n267\n00:15:34.549 --> 00:15:39.255\nor I can type in basically another\nname here and now it will try mine.\n\n268\n00:15:39.255 --> 00:15:44.430\nIt will say all right he typed in\nserverone, let's try lab.itpro.tv.\n\n269\n00:15:44.430 --> 00:15:47.910\nI couldn't find a server 01.lab.itpro.tv.\n\n270\n00:15:47.910 --> 00:15:50.181\nAll right, lets' try this other one,\ncontoso.com.\n\n271\n00:15:50.181 --> 00:15:52.737\nLet's try server1.contoso.com.\n\n272\n00:15:52.737 --> 00:15:53.525\nThat one worked.\n\n273\n00:15:53.525 --> 00:15:56.870\nSo now I'm giving it just\na another thing to try.\n\n274\n00:15:56.870 --> 00:15:58.843\nTry my primary DNS suffix.\n\n275\n00:15:58.843 --> 00:16:03.158\nIf that doesn't work, here's my\nconnection specific DNS suffix, right?\n\n276\n00:16:03.158 --> 00:16:04.774\nYou don't see this too often, but\n\n277\n00:16:04.774 --> 00:16:08.992\nsometimes you'll have a multi home machine\nthat's connected to more than one network.\n\n278\n00:16:08.992 --> 00:16:11.350\nAnd I need to resolve names\non that other network.\n\n279\n00:16:11.350 --> 00:16:13.590\nNot the domain that I belong to,\nbut that other network.\n\n280\n00:16:13.590 --> 00:16:16.710\nAnd so\nI can do connection specific DNS suffixes.\n\n281\n00:16:16.710 --> 00:16:17.550\n&gt;&gt; And that little box,\n\n282\n00:16:17.550 --> 00:16:21.540\njust like we say with our DNS IP\naddresses, that can set the precedence or\n\n283\n00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:23.630\norder there.\n&gt;&gt; As far as,\n\n284\n00:16:23.630 --> 00:16:24.926\nthis down here?\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n285\n00:16:24.926 --> 00:16:25.493\n&gt;&gt; Well, hold on to that\n\n286\n00:16:25.493 --> 00:16:26.049\nthought.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n287\n00:16:26.049 --> 00:16:27.488\n&gt;&gt; We'll get there in just a second.\n\n288\n00:16:27.488 --> 00:16:29.960\nSo that this check mark says append.\n\n289\n00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:30.900\nAnd this is the default.\n\n290\n00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:34.210\nThis is the way Windows behaves, right?\n\n291\n00:16:34.210 --> 00:16:38.110\nBut it does only give me this one option,\nand so\n\n292\n00:16:38.110 --> 00:16:41.760\nwhat Cherokee was getting to is\nthis radio button right here.\n\n293\n00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:45.010\nAppend these DNS suffixes in order.\n\n294\n00:16:45.010 --> 00:16:47.492\nSo if I wanted to try more than that.\n\n295\n00:16:47.492 --> 00:16:53.610\nLet's say I've got an environment\nwhere my forest is ItPro.TV.\n\n296\n00:16:53.610 --> 00:16:58.475\nBut there's Lab.ItPro.TV,\nthere's Training.ItPro.TV,\n\n297\n00:16:58.475 --> 00:17:04.047\nthere's sales@east.ITPro.TV,\nthere's sales@west.ITPro.TV.\n\n298\n00:17:04.047 --> 00:17:09.051\nMaybe we even have another DNS\nname space In our forest, right?\n\n299\n00:17:09.051 --> 00:17:12.485\nCuz remember a separate tree with DNS,\ncheck out our sever shows,\n\n300\n00:17:12.485 --> 00:17:16.676\ncould have a completely different name,\nlike Toso or Northwindtraders.com.\n\n301\n00:17:16.676 --> 00:17:21.018\nAnd so that's where I can start adding\nadditional DNS suffixes in here.\n\n302\n00:17:21.018 --> 00:17:24.920\nBut, what I want you to notice is what\nhappens when I choose this radio button.\n\n303\n00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:26.050\nWhat happened to this guy up here?\n\n304\n00:17:27.110 --> 00:17:32.210\nIt's not going to append the primary info?\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, it's deselective.\n\n305\n00:17:32.210 --> 00:17:34.347\nRadio buttons typically mean one\n&gt;&gt; One.\n\n306\n00:17:34.347 --> 00:17:35.350\n&gt;&gt; Or the other, right?\n\n307\n00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:39.570\nThey're mutually exclusive, so when I\nturn this one on, this one turns off.\n\n308\n00:17:39.570 --> 00:17:42.700\nWhen I turn this one on,\nthe other one turns off.\n\n309\n00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:45.020\nAnd this is a big mistake\nI see people making.\n\n310\n00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:48.872\nHey, if we've got a test domain that\na lot of people connect to printers or\n\n311\n00:17:48.872 --> 00:17:50.040\nresources in.\n\n312\n00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:54.240\nAnd so\nI'm just gonna come in here and add,\n\n313\n00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:59.026\nI'm gonna say test.lab.itpro.tv.\n&gt;&gt; And forget about the primary?\n\n314\n00:17:59.026 --> 00:18:00.280\n&gt;&gt; And I'll click add.\n\n315\n00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:02.397\nExactly, and they think okay,\nnow everything should work.\n\n316\n00:18:02.397 --> 00:18:06.832\nAnd all of a sudden they can't log in,\nthey can't connect to any normal resources\n\n317\n00:18:06.832 --> 00:18:11.150\nand that's because when they chose this,\nit turned this one off.\n\n318\n00:18:11.150 --> 00:18:14.780\nWhat that means is you need to add\nevery one that you're gonna try.\n\n319\n00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:17.350\nSo I would have to come back in here and\ngo you know what?\n\n320\n00:18:17.350 --> 00:18:22.400\nNow that this is unselected, I'm gonna\nhave to tell it don't forget to try.\n\n321\n00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:23.795\nOops, what is our primary?\n\n322\n00:18:23.795 --> 00:18:29.390\nLab.itpro.tv, don't forget\nto try that one, right?\n\n323\n00:18:29.390 --> 00:18:31.870\nBecause it's no longer going\nto do it automatically.\n\n324\n00:18:31.870 --> 00:18:33.490\nI can also rearrange them.\n\n325\n00:18:33.490 --> 00:18:34.970\nMost of the resources are labs.\n\n326\n00:18:34.970 --> 00:18:36.470\nSo I'm gonna put that one first.\n\n327\n00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:37.420\nTry that one first.\n\n328\n00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:38.230\nIf it works, great.\n\n329\n00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:41.930\nIf it doesn't work,\ntry test lab.lab.itpro.tv.\n\n330\n00:18:41.930 --> 00:18:45.135\nOr maybe I wanna say hey,\nwe've got another network,\n\n331\n00:18:45.135 --> 00:18:49.860\nnorthwindtraders.com and so I can.\n\n332\n00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:53.500\nOops, and I didn't spell northwind,\nthat's why we got that edit button there.\n\n333\n00:18:54.550 --> 00:18:58.828\nSo we can add as many as we want, but\njust remember once you start the list,\n\n334\n00:18:58.828 --> 00:19:02.903\nyou have to include everything that\nyou want in that list, all right?\n\n335\n00:19:02.903 --> 00:19:03.620\n&gt;&gt; Good tip.\n\n336\n00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:05.028\n&gt;&gt; It doesn't append your primary and\n\n337\n00:19:05.028 --> 00:19:07.340\nconnection specific DNS suffices any more.\n\n338\n00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:08.350\nIt doesn't do any of that.\n\n339\n00:19:08.350 --> 00:19:09.700\nSo keep that in mind.\n\n340\n00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:14.290\nI'm gonna switch back to primary and\nconnection specific, all right.\n\n341\n00:19:14.290 --> 00:19:21.090\nNow, right below that, append parent\nsuffices, of the primary DNS suffix.\n\n342\n00:19:21.090 --> 00:19:22.090\nThat's an odd one.\n\n343\n00:19:22.090 --> 00:19:26.810\nAll right, it is checked be default, I can\nturn it off, or I can turn it back on.\n\n344\n00:19:26.810 --> 00:19:32.301\nThis is known as DNS devolution,\nwe are gonna devolve a name,\n\n345\n00:19:32.301 --> 00:19:35.481\nin order to resolve it, all right?\n\n346\n00:19:35.481 --> 00:19:37.684\nAnd in order for that to make sense,\n\n347\n00:19:37.684 --> 00:19:41.735\nI think we're gonna have to do\na little bit of explaining, Lucy.\n\n348\n00:19:41.735 --> 00:19:46.310\nSo let me jump out here, for a second.\n\n349\n00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:50.590\nAnd let's say, I thought I had\none pulled up, there we go.\n\n350\n00:19:51.930 --> 00:19:54.712\nLets say we've got a network\nthat looks something like this.\n\n351\n00:19:54.712 --> 00:20:00.425\nWere gonna start off with\na domain up here, and\n\n352\n00:20:00.425 --> 00:20:03.490\nwe're going to change\na few things about it.\n\n353\n00:20:03.490 --> 00:20:06.799\nSo this is gonna be itpro.tv, and\n\n354\n00:20:06.799 --> 00:20:11.943\nI want that centered just\nbecause I like it like that.\n\n355\n00:20:11.943 --> 00:20:14.934\nThen we'll copy and\npaste that a couple times.\n\n356\n00:20:14.934 --> 00:20:18.957\nAnd let's say we've got lab.it, oops,\n\n357\n00:20:18.957 --> 00:20:23.100\nI've already got that, lab.itpro.tv.\n\n358\n00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:25.572\nLet's say we've got something like,\n\n359\n00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:32.507\nTraining.lab.itpro.tv And\n\n360\n00:20:32.507 --> 00:20:37.160\nwe'll put that guy over here.\n\n361\n00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:44.679\nAnd maybe this one could\nbe our new eu.itpro.tv.\n\n362\n00:20:44.679 --> 00:20:49.110\nI don't know we could do all kinds of\nthings here just have a bunch of fun.\n\n363\n00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:54.830\nAnd we're gonna open up an office in\nSouth America so we'll say sa.itpro.tv.\n\n364\n00:20:54.830 --> 00:20:59.284\nAnd then we better draw some lines\nJust to make sure everything is\n\n365\n00:20:59.284 --> 00:21:00.855\nconnected up nicely.\n\n366\n00:21:02.790 --> 00:21:08.100\nSo this is just a heavily\ndomained environment,\n\n367\n00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:13.416\nwhere I have multiple\ndomains within my forest.\n\n368\n00:21:13.416 --> 00:21:16.587\nSo maybe we've got something like, oops,\n\n369\n00:21:16.587 --> 00:21:18.393\nhe lost his connection.\n\n370\n00:21:18.393 --> 00:21:19.200\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n\n371\n00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:22.472\nWe got something that looks,\nthere's another one that's not connected,\n\n372\n00:21:22.472 --> 00:21:23.349\ngoodness gracious.\n\n373\n00:21:23.349 --> 00:21:26.720\nYou got something that looks like that,\nall right?\n\n374\n00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:31.630\nSo if I'm a little client machine,\nwait down in here\n\n375\n00:21:31.630 --> 00:21:36.420\nIn training.lab.itpro.tv.\n\n376\n00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:44.635\nAnd lets put a server way up\nhere in itpro.tv, all right.\n\n377\n00:21:44.635 --> 00:21:48.388\nWell my connection specific or\nmy primary DNS suffix, for\n\n378\n00:21:48.388 --> 00:21:51.790\nthis computer will be\ntraining.lab.itpro.tv.\n\n379\n00:21:51.790 --> 00:21:59.375\nAnd lets pretend that its name is\nclient3.training.lab.itpro.tv.\n\n380\n00:21:59.375 --> 00:22:04.234\nAnd we wanna connect to the server\nup here, we're using unqualified\n\n381\n00:22:04.234 --> 00:22:08.530\nnames,lets say this server\nI don't know file01, okay.\n\n382\n00:22:08.530 --> 00:22:14.080\nWell, what's gonna happen\nif I type in File01 into a,\n\n383\n00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:16.100\nI don't know,\nsome kind of connection dialup box?\n\n384\n00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:21.070\nSo I'm using an unqualified name\nto connect to that resource.\n\n385\n00:22:21.070 --> 00:22:23.480\nHere's what's gonna happen, all right?\n\n386\n00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:26.020\nSo we say that the client's\nname is Client03.\n\n387\n00:22:26.020 --> 00:22:31.600\nAnd it's part of training.lab.itpro.tv,\nall right?\n\n388\n00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:38.210\nSo if I use an unqualified name,\nif I just type in File01, all right?\n\n389\n00:22:38.210 --> 00:22:41.370\nWindows, because I've got a pin,\nprimary, and\n\n390\n00:22:41.370 --> 00:22:44.340\nconnection specific DNS suffixes,\nthat's the default.\n\n391\n00:22:44.340 --> 00:22:48.400\nIs gonna say all right,\nhe didn't tell me the last name of File01.\n\n392\n00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:54.100\nI'm gonna assume it's in the same\ndomain as him, if I can type and\n\n393\n00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:56.780\ntalk at the same time, itpro.tv.\n\n394\n00:22:56.780 --> 00:22:57.780\nIt's gonna try that first.\n\n395\n00:22:57.780 --> 00:23:00.670\nIt's gonna say all right it is\nprobably in the same domain,\n\n396\n00:23:00.670 --> 00:23:04.580\nprobably has the same DNS suffix,\nand let's just try that.\n\n397\n00:23:04.580 --> 00:23:06.070\nAnd maybe that'll work.\n\n398\n00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:09.630\nIf it doesn't work, DNS is going to,\n\n399\n00:23:09.630 --> 00:23:14.775\naccording to my options here,\nwhere's my little Windows 10 machine.\n\n400\n00:23:14.775 --> 00:23:16.980\nAll right, according to my options,\n\n401\n00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:23.090\nit's going to append parent suffixes\nof the primary DNS suffix, all right?\n\n402\n00:23:23.090 --> 00:23:25.700\nSo what that means is it's gonna do this.\n\n403\n00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:27.140\nThis didn't work, this failed.\n\n404\n00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:31.740\nLet's make that red cuz it didn't work,\nall right?\n\n405\n00:23:31.740 --> 00:23:35.530\nSo it says, all right,\nI'm gonna drop, and try the parent.\n\n406\n00:23:35.530 --> 00:23:36.615\nWell, who's the parent?\n\n407\n00:23:36.615 --> 00:23:39.110\nDNS suffix, here I am.\n\n408\n00:23:39.110 --> 00:23:45.185\nIf I go up one, I've got lab.itpro.tv.\n\n409\n00:23:45.185 --> 00:23:45.930\nSo that's what it's gonna do.\n\n410\n00:23:45.930 --> 00:23:52.721\nIt's gonna say file01.lab.itpro.tv.\n\n411\n00:23:52.721 --> 00:23:53.638\nYou see what it did?\n\n412\n00:23:53.638 --> 00:23:57.940\nIt drop this part out.\n\n413\n00:23:57.940 --> 00:24:03.260\nAnd we'll make it a different color so we\ncan see that it's going away, all right?\n\n414\n00:24:03.260 --> 00:24:07.330\nAnd I picked a color that doesn't\nshow up on the screen very well.\n\n415\n00:24:07.330 --> 00:24:09.590\nThat's brilliant, Michael.\n\n416\n00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:13.670\nLet's try, I don't know, cherry.\n\n417\n00:24:13.670 --> 00:24:15.020\n&gt;&gt; Blue.\n&gt;&gt; Blue?\n\n418\n00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:15.680\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n419\n00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:16.740\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n\n420\n00:24:16.740 --> 00:24:18.100\nAll right, so see what it's doing?\n\n421\n00:24:18.100 --> 00:24:20.561\nIt's dropping the parent DNS suffix, or\n\n422\n00:24:20.561 --> 00:24:25.420\nit's dropping, I'm sorry, this piece.\nAnd it's moving up to the parent domain.\n\n423\n00:24:25.420 --> 00:24:28.119\nAgain, very visible in my drawing here,\nfrom\n\n424\n00:24:28.119 --> 00:24:31.241\ntraining.lab.itpro.tv to lab.itpro.tv.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n425\n00:24:31.241 --> 00:24:35.252\nwe're omitting the training subdomain.\n&gt;&gt; Exactly,\n\n426\n00:24:35.252 --> 00:24:38.155\nwe're devolving that name.\n&gt;&gt; Devolving.\n\n427\n00:24:38.155 --> 00:24:39.445\n&gt;&gt; It's gonna try that.\n\n428\n00:24:39.445 --> 00:24:41.035\nIf that works, great.\n\n429\n00:24:41.035 --> 00:24:47.660\nIf that doesn't work, well, heck,\nlet's try File01.itpro.tv, right?\n\n430\n00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:51.052\nAnd we're gonna drop off lab.\n\n431\n00:24:51.052 --> 00:24:56.630\nDrop that off and move our way up to that\nparent domain, all the way up to here.\n\n432\n00:24:56.630 --> 00:24:59.860\nAnd if that's where that server resides,\nthen this will work.\n\n433\n00:24:59.860 --> 00:25:02.070\nAnd this happens all on\nits own in the background.\n\n434\n00:25:02.070 --> 00:25:05.813\nThis is what that means by append\nparent suffixes, all right?\n\n435\n00:25:05.813 --> 00:25:09.038\nWhat it won't do, though, so\nhopefully that makes sense, and\n\n436\n00:25:09.038 --> 00:25:13.590\nI would eventually connect to that\nresource because I've worked my way up.\n\n437\n00:25:13.590 --> 00:25:16.780\nBut what if I move that server over here?\n\n438\n00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:24.510\nNow the server's name is sa or\nit's File01.sa.itpro.tv.\n\n439\n00:25:24.510 --> 00:25:26.250\nIs that process going to work?\n\n440\n00:25:27.610 --> 00:25:28.380\nNo.\n\n441\n00:25:28.380 --> 00:25:33.606\nIf the name I'm looking for\nis File01.sa.itpro.tv,\n\n442\n00:25:33.606 --> 00:25:39.040\nall right, and I just type in File01,\nit's gonna append my\n\n443\n00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:44.385\nprimary DNS suffix,\nwhich is training.lab.itpro.tv.\n\n444\n00:25:44.385 --> 00:25:47.538\nThen it's gonna devolve\nit to lab.itpro.tv.\n\n445\n00:25:47.538 --> 00:25:50.180\nThen it's gonna do just itpro.tv.\n\n446\n00:25:50.180 --> 00:25:52.030\nIt's never gonna add anything, right?\n\n447\n00:25:52.030 --> 00:25:56.510\nWe're just taking pieces away one\nat a time until we get to the top.\n\n448\n00:25:56.510 --> 00:25:58.340\nIt doesn't know what to add back, I mean,\n\n449\n00:25:58.340 --> 00:26:01.530\nrandomly pick names that you\nmight have named your domain?\n\n450\n00:26:01.530 --> 00:26:03.280\nIt wouldn't know to add that.\n\n451\n00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:08.860\nSo how could I find that resource\nover there in sa.itpro.tv and\n\n452\n00:26:08.860 --> 00:26:10.890\nstill use an unqualified name?\n\n453\n00:26:11.890 --> 00:26:12.460\nCan we?\n\n454\n00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:15.000\nYes we can, right?\n\n455\n00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:18.954\nI can come over here and\nadd sa.ipro.tv, and say, hey,\n\n456\n00:26:18.954 --> 00:26:21.065\ndon't forget to try this one.\n\n457\n00:26:21.065 --> 00:26:23.810\nBut keep in mind what's\ngonna happen when I do that.\n\n458\n00:26:23.810 --> 00:26:30.050\nIf I click Add, and I do sa.itpro.tv,\nit will now try that.\n\n459\n00:26:30.050 --> 00:26:36.002\nAnytime I use an unqualified name, it'll\ntry that, but look what it's not trying.\n\n460\n00:26:36.002 --> 00:26:40.735\nlab.itpro.tv's in my name, but\nit's not trying just itpro.tv.\n\n461\n00:26:40.735 --> 00:26:45.611\nSo again, it comes back to the fact\nthat if you start this list,\n\n462\n00:26:45.611 --> 00:26:51.344\nright, you need to make sure you add\nall things that you want it to try.\n\n463\n00:26:51.344 --> 00:26:58.780\nIncluding training.lab.itpro.tv,\nlab.itpro.tv, just itpro.tv.\n\n464\n00:26:58.780 --> 00:27:00.940\nOnce you start that list,\nyou have to include it all.\n\n465\n00:27:00.940 --> 00:27:05.820\nBut that's the process of name\ndevolution and how it can find\n\n466\n00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:10.850\nresources even when you\nuse unqualified names.\n\n467\n00:27:10.850 --> 00:27:17.200\nBut what I want you to note there is that\neven though we're using an unqualified\n\n468\n00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:21.300\nname, DNS is still being resolved\nusing a fully qualified domain name.\n\n469\n00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:22.600\nThe computer's doing it for you and\n\n470\n00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:26.100\ntacking on things to the end,\nhoping it gets it right.\n\n471\n00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:32.100\nBut some people seem to think, or they get\nconfused and go, I typed in a single name,\n\n472\n00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:36.450\nand it resolved it, so DNS doesn't have\nto have a fully qualified domain name.\n\n473\n00:27:36.450 --> 00:27:37.660\nYes, it does.\n\n474\n00:27:37.660 --> 00:27:39.240\nIt's doing something in the background.\n\n475\n00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:43.960\nWhen you give it an unqualified name,\nyour system's going, here he goes again.\n\n476\n00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:45.330\nLet me fix it for him.\n\n477\n00:27:45.330 --> 00:27:48.410\nTurn it into a fully qualified\ndomain name in attempting\n\n478\n00:27:48.410 --> 00:27:50.260\nto resolve it.\n&gt;&gt; All right, Mike.\n\n479\n00:27:50.260 --> 00:27:52.230\nI'm looking at the list and\nI'm looking at the clock.\n\n480\n00:27:52.230 --> 00:27:52.980\nAre we finished?\n\n481\n00:27:52.980 --> 00:27:54.200\nDo you have any final thoughts?\n\n482\n00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:56.060\nWhat's the plan?\n&gt;&gt; We are really close.\n\n483\n00:27:56.060 --> 00:27:59.066\nSo I think we keep going for\njust another minute.\n\n484\n00:27:59.066 --> 00:28:02.330\nThe only thing left on this\npart of the objectives for\n\n485\n00:28:02.330 --> 00:28:05.730\nthe exam is configuring network locations.\n\n486\n00:28:05.730 --> 00:28:08.880\nAnd this is relatively easy to do.\n\n487\n00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:12.350\nWe'll talk a little bit about it\nwhen we get into firewalls as well,\n\n488\n00:28:12.350 --> 00:28:14.560\ncuz that's really where\nit comes into play.\n\n489\n00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:16.425\nBut as far as TCP/IP settings,\n\n490\n00:28:16.425 --> 00:28:19.910\nit wants you to know where\nyou can go to change them.\n\n491\n00:28:19.910 --> 00:28:23.490\nWith your network locations,\nthere's three network locations.\n\n492\n00:28:23.490 --> 00:28:26.970\nThere's public, private,\nand then domain, right?\n\n493\n00:28:26.970 --> 00:28:29.190\nAnd the first time you\nconnect to a network,\n\n494\n00:28:29.190 --> 00:28:33.020\nWindows 10 will ask you,\nwhat do you wanna do with this network?\n\n495\n00:28:33.020 --> 00:28:37.629\nNow unfortunately it doesn't\nuse the same terms, public and\n\n496\n00:28:37.629 --> 00:28:42.600\nprivate and domain, but\nthe logic is there I guess, right?\n\n497\n00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:45.520\nWhen you connect to a network for the\nfirst time, you might have seen this bar\n\n498\n00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:48.581\ncome out down the right hand of\nyour monitor, it will slide out.\n\n499\n00:28:48.581 --> 00:28:53.290\nAnd it says, would you like to see\nother resources and allow your\n\n500\n00:28:53.290 --> 00:28:57.790\ncomputer to be seen on this network,\nor something to that effect, right?\n\n501\n00:28:57.790 --> 00:29:02.290\nAnd if you choose yes, it's marking\nthe network as a private network.\n\n502\n00:29:02.290 --> 00:29:06.620\nAnd it's saying, all right, this is\na private network, it's relatively safe.\n\n503\n00:29:06.620 --> 00:29:10.030\nAnd I'm gonna make this machine visible\nto the other computers on the network, so\n\n504\n00:29:10.030 --> 00:29:13.750\nif I have shares, they'd be able to see\nthem and potentially connect to them.\n\n505\n00:29:13.750 --> 00:29:17.960\nAnd if they have shares, I'd see them,\nand I could potentially connect to them.\n\n506\n00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:20.540\nIf I choose no the first\ntime I connect and\n\n507\n00:29:20.540 --> 00:29:24.300\nthat little window slides out,\nI'm setting it to a public network.\n\n508\n00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:27.340\nI'm saying, no, I don't want to\nmake my computer visible, and\n\n509\n00:29:27.340 --> 00:29:31.240\nbasically turning on the public flag for\nthat network.\n\n510\n00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:32.800\nAnd that's gonna increase security.\n\n511\n00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:36.690\nIt's gonna say, all right, I'm not gonna\nallow other people to see any shares\n\n512\n00:29:36.690 --> 00:29:40.800\nyou have, and I'm not gonna show you\nshares on other machines on this network.\n\n513\n00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:44.850\nThis is when you're at Starbucks,\nor the airport, or at the hotel.\n\n514\n00:29:44.850 --> 00:29:48.891\nWe wanna flag those networks as public\nto give us a little bit more protection,\n\n515\n00:29:48.891 --> 00:29:51.417\ncuz you don't know what\nelse is on that network.\n\n516\n00:29:51.417 --> 00:29:55.730\nIf I'm at home, I'll call it a private\nnetwork because I know the other machines.\n\n517\n00:29:55.730 --> 00:30:00.390\nI've got physical security, and\nI'm relatively safe on that network, and\n\n518\n00:30:00.390 --> 00:30:03.410\nI wanna share files between my computers.\n\n519\n00:30:03.410 --> 00:30:07.270\nAt work, you're gonna be running\nmost likely a domain controller.\n\n520\n00:30:07.270 --> 00:30:10.800\nAnd when you plug a Windows 10 machine\ninto a network that has a domain\n\n521\n00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:15.370\ncontroller, if the machine is part of\nthe domain, it'll flag it as domain.\n\n522\n00:30:15.370 --> 00:30:19.740\nRemember, public, private, and\ndomain are my three network locations.\n\n523\n00:30:19.740 --> 00:30:21.640\nIt'll set it as a domain,\nand you can't change it.\n\n524\n00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:24.240\nWindows 10 does that automatically.\n\n525\n00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:25.460\nIf you're not part of the domain,\n\n526\n00:30:25.460 --> 00:30:30.770\nlet's say you're a guest visiting company\nXYZ and you connect to their network,\n\n527\n00:30:30.770 --> 00:30:33.220\nit will ask you,\ndo you wanna call it public and private?\n\n528\n00:30:33.220 --> 00:30:36.920\nBut if you're part of the domain, it'll\nautomatically turn on domain profile.\n\n529\n00:30:38.190 --> 00:30:40.670\nAnd that's another set\nof relaxed settings.\n\n530\n00:30:40.670 --> 00:30:45.580\nBecause we assume that in a domain we have\nphysical security, we have other security\n\n531\n00:30:45.580 --> 00:30:49.800\nmeasures in place, and I'm relatively\nsafe, and I wanna see those file shares.\n\n532\n00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:51.285\nI'm at work, I need to connect\nto those file shares, right?\n\n533\n00:30:51.285 --> 00:30:53.699\n&gt;&gt; We're assuming that it's safer than,\n\n534\n00:30:53.699 --> 00:30:57.680\nlet's say, if we were at some\nrandom Internet cafe or something.\n\n535\n00:30:57.680 --> 00:31:01.068\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly right, so I got that,\n\n536\n00:31:01.068 --> 00:31:05.690\nthough what they have on the exam\nobjectives is configure network locations.\n\n537\n00:31:05.690 --> 00:31:09.160\nWell again, it asks you when you\nfirst connect to the network.\n\n538\n00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:11.940\nOnce you've answered that,\nit remembers it.\n\n539\n00:31:11.940 --> 00:31:14.330\nSo the next time you go\nback to that same hotel,\n\n540\n00:31:14.330 --> 00:31:18.450\nthe next time you go to that\nfast-food joint that has free wi-fi,\n\n541\n00:31:18.450 --> 00:31:21.912\nit's gonna remember your\nanswer from the last time.\n\n542\n00:31:21.912 --> 00:31:24.130\nIt doesn't have to ask you again.\n\n543\n00:31:24.130 --> 00:31:27.690\nIf you answered incorrectly last time,\nor if you want to change your mind about\n\n544\n00:31:27.690 --> 00:31:32.020\nthat, you can go back in after\nthe fact and change that.\n\n545\n00:31:32.020 --> 00:31:34.801\nAnd let's take a look at where.\n\n546\n00:31:34.801 --> 00:31:38.040\nAll right, I'm gonna close these windows\nout just so we can kinda start over.\n\n547\n00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:40.920\nI'm gonna go into my Network and\nInternet Settings, which, of course,\n\n548\n00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:43.100\nyou guys know you can get\nto in many different ways.\n\n549\n00:31:43.100 --> 00:31:44.588\nWe're gonna go to ethernet.\n\n550\n00:31:44.588 --> 00:31:46.660\nI joined this guy to the domain, didn't I?\n\n551\n00:31:46.660 --> 00:31:47.490\nDoggone it.\n\n552\n00:31:47.490 --> 00:31:49.290\nI'm gonna have to unjoin him to show you.\n\n553\n00:31:49.290 --> 00:31:52.253\nI forgot I was gonna show you\nthis before I joined the domain.\n\n554\n00:31:52.253 --> 00:31:55.421\nIf I click Change adapter settings,\nthat's not what I want.\n\n555\n00:31:55.421 --> 00:31:59.955\nIf I click on the actual network adapter,\nI come to this screen here.\n\n556\n00:31:59.955 --> 00:32:04.710\nThis is where you would see public or\nprivate options.\n\n557\n00:32:04.710 --> 00:32:09.380\nBecause I'm on a domain network,\nI'm part of the domain.\n\n558\n00:32:09.380 --> 00:32:11.070\nYou can see that I am flagged.\n\n559\n00:32:11.070 --> 00:32:11.820\nLet me pull this up.\n\n560\n00:32:13.140 --> 00:32:15.756\nEthernet, change it after.\n\n561\n00:32:15.756 --> 00:32:18.640\nSee it says lab.itpro.tv there?\n\n562\n00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:23.150\nIt's detected that an auto domain network\nand it supplied by domain profile, and\n\n563\n00:32:23.150 --> 00:32:24.630\nI can't change it.\n\n564\n00:32:24.630 --> 00:32:26.310\nI'm stuck with that.\n\n565\n00:32:26.310 --> 00:32:31.370\nBut if I get on my own personal machine,\n\n566\n00:32:31.370 --> 00:32:36.450\nlet's see how much trouble I can get into\nhere and I've open up my network and\n\n567\n00:32:36.450 --> 00:32:40.380\nI take a look at Wi-Fi\nsince I'm not wired.\n\n568\n00:32:40.380 --> 00:32:44.050\nI can see I've connected\nthis ITProTV network.\n\n569\n00:32:44.050 --> 00:32:48.770\nI click on it and here,\nI see my network profile options.\n\n570\n00:32:48.770 --> 00:32:50.020\nOne says public.\n\n571\n00:32:50.020 --> 00:32:51.170\nOne says private.\n\n572\n00:32:51.170 --> 00:32:54.490\nSo if I changed my mind,\nlet's say, I went to that hotel.\n\n573\n00:32:54.490 --> 00:32:56.230\nAnd man, that window slid out.\n\n574\n00:32:56.230 --> 00:33:01.420\nI just clicked yes and it slid back in,\nand I just flagged the hotel as private.\n\n575\n00:33:01.420 --> 00:33:04.360\nMeaning, it's gonna reduce security.\n&gt;&gt; Cuz it's so sketchy in the lobby.\n\n576\n00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:06.550\nSo you don't know about these people.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n577\n00:33:06.550 --> 00:33:10.050\nI was out I start seeing like\na connection attempts to our laptop.\n\n578\n00:33:10.050 --> 00:33:13.143\nPeople are trying to connect\nto my shared folders like\n\n579\n00:33:13.143 --> 00:33:15.110\nhow do I change this back to private?\n\n580\n00:33:15.110 --> 00:33:19.818\nYou simply come in to the settings\nin here and change that to public or\n\n581\n00:33:19.818 --> 00:33:22.400\nprivate whichever one you want.\n\n582\n00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:24.290\nAgain, I might have said that backwards.\n\n583\n00:33:24.290 --> 00:33:26.350\nPublic is the one that's more secure.\n&gt;&gt; More restricitve.\n\n584\n00:33:26.350 --> 00:33:28.280\n&gt;&gt; When you're on an untrusted network,\n\n585\n00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:31.600\nyou wanna let it know that you don't\ntrust it, you change it to public.\n\n586\n00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:35.810\nYour home, your work, your friend's house,\nmaybe you call it private.\n\n587\n00:33:35.810 --> 00:33:36.660\nSo that's where you do it.\n\n588\n00:33:36.660 --> 00:33:37.750\nIt is a little confusing.\n\n589\n00:33:37.750 --> 00:33:40.810\nSo let me go back out here,\ncuz you don't go to,\n\n590\n00:33:40.810 --> 00:33:46.860\nnormally you might think about going to\nthe actual network adapters settings.\n\n591\n00:33:46.860 --> 00:33:51.430\nBut you don't like if I go to Ethernet,\nthis is where I would see it here.\n\n592\n00:33:51.430 --> 00:33:55.270\nI'm not connected to,\nI don't have my wire plugged in right now.\n\n593\n00:33:55.270 --> 00:33:59.200\nBut notice I'm not going to\nthe network adapters properties.\n\n594\n00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:01.440\nI'm not going my TCP/IP settings.\n\n595\n00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:06.470\nIn Windows 10, you click on\nthe name of the network connection.\n\n596\n00:34:06.470 --> 00:34:09.610\nCuz that's really what you're changing\nthe properties of is the connection and\n\n597\n00:34:09.610 --> 00:34:11.360\nyou change that network profile.\n\n598\n00:34:12.470 --> 00:34:17.110\nAgain, for domain computers,\nif we go back over to the VM and\n\n599\n00:34:17.110 --> 00:34:22.220\nwe take a look at this guy,\nI'm not clicking change adapter settings.\n\n600\n00:34:22.220 --> 00:34:25.440\nI'm clicking the actual connection.\n\n601\n00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:27.935\nBecause this is domain,\nI don't see those same options.\n\n602\n00:34:27.935 --> 00:34:29.716\nI'm unable to change it.\n\n603\n00:34:29.716 --> 00:34:33.034\nSo there's where you change\nyour public and private.\n\n604\n00:34:33.034 --> 00:34:35.830\nAnd again, we'll talk a little bit more\nabout those profiles when we get into our\n\n605\n00:34:35.830 --> 00:34:37.280\nfirewall episodes coming up.\n\n606\n00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:42.290\nBut for now, that pretty much covers\nyour name resolution settings when\n\n607\n00:34:42.290 --> 00:34:45.340\nit comes to TCP/IP settings in Windows 10.\n&gt;&gt; Awesome, Mike.\n\n608\n00:34:45.340 --> 00:34:46.060\nIt was a great show.\n\n609\n00:34:46.060 --> 00:34:48.310\nWe learned a lot in this show,\nthe evolution.\n\n610\n00:34:48.310 --> 00:34:50.480\nAll sorts of our\nconfiguration settings here.\n\n611\n00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:53.940\nSo thank you for that and thank you for\njoining us, but we are out of time.\n\n612\n00:34:53.940 --> 00:34:55.220\nSo let's sign out.\n\n613\n00:34:55.220 --> 00:34:57.420\nI've been your host, Cherokee Boose.\n&gt;&gt; And I am Mike Rodrick.\n\n614\n00:34:57.420 --> 00:34:59.320\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here in ITProTV.\n\n615\n00:34:59.320 --> 00:35:05.593\n[MUSIC]\n\n616\n00:35:05.593 --> 00:35:09.097\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

You're watching ITPro.TV.\n&gt;&gt; Welcome everyone\n\n4\n00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:17.350\nto a Configure Windows Devices series\nespecially for that 70-697 exam.\n\n5\n00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:19.790\nI'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:21.870\nAnd in this show we'll\nbe taking a look at,\n\n7\n00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:24.610\nwell, how we can configure\nnetwork settings.\n\n8\n00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:27.650\nAnd with us today in studios,\nwe have Mr. Mike Rodrick.\n\n9\n00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:29.520\nHow's it going today, Mike?\n&gt;&gt; It's going great Cherokee.\n\n10\n00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.920\nThanks for having me back,\nexcited as always.\n\n11\n00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.120\nAnd yeah, we've got more networking\ncoming your way as we work our way\n\n12\n00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.000\nthrough our objectives for\nthis 70-697 exam.\n\n13\n00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.110\nAnd on this one, they say network settings\nthat underneath that objective we're gonna\n\n14\n00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.960\nfocus in on connecting to a wireless\nnetwork, managing preferred wireless\n\n15\n00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:52.106\nnetworks, configuring network adapters,\nand configuring location-aware printing.\n\n16\n00:00:52.106 --> 00:00:55.980\nI always thought under network\nsettings we'd see things like IP and\n\n17\n00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.650\nstuff like that, but\nnot in this particular exam.\n\n18\n00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:03.940\nAll right, so, starting off with\nconnecting to a wireless network, right?\n\n19\n00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.430\nWhen you connect to a wireless network,\n\n20\n00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.920\nthere's\n&gt;&gt; Mike, kids can do that.\n\n21\n00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:11.840\n&gt;&gt; I know, right?\n\n22\n00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.420\n&gt;&gt; It's so like, I don't know,\n\n23\n00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.040\nI guess we can't assume these days,\n\n24\n00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.110\nthough, right, Mike?\n&gt;&gt; You can't, right?\n\n25\n00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:22.150\nAnd we have to understand, we have to be\nable to support those not children right,\n\n26\n00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:23.340\nthose [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; Adults.\n\n27\n00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.089\n&gt;&gt; Yeah me, that needs to connect to,\n\n28\n00:01:25.089 --> 00:01:29.140\nand I wanna connect to a wireless network,\nso how do we go about it?\n\n29\n00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.040\nSo let's take a look at my screen here.\n\n30\n00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.850\nI'm actually using my physical\nlaptop instead of VMs for\n\n31\n00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.210\nthis because I need to get to\nmy wireless network adapter.\n\n32\n00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.160\nBut down here on my system tray,\nif I can zoom in.\n\n33\n00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:46.900\nI see this little icon here with\na pretty standard wireless-type icon.\n\n34\n00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.858\nThat is how I'm gonna access\nmy wireless networks.\n\n35\n00:01:50.858 --> 00:01:53.610\nSo if I click on that,\nthis little pane pops up.\n\n36\n00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.430\nAnd what this is showing me is all\nthe different wireless networks\n\n37\n00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.020\nthat I can connect to.\n&gt;&gt; Well, Mike,\n\n38\n00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.630\nwe were just joking about dealing\nwith connecting to wireless networks.\n\n39\n00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.530\nBut the reality is it's so\ncommon nowadays that companies,\n\n40\n00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.930\ncorporate environments, that you're\nentering may have more than one,\n\n41\n00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:14.570\nusually have more than one\nwireless network available to you.\n\n42\n00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:18.370\nSo it can be a little confusing when\nit comes to choosing the correct one,\n\n43\n00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:19.770\nhow do I set it, and things like that.\n\n44\n00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.710\nSo that's what we'll be looking at here?\n&gt;&gt; It is,\n\n45\n00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:25.330\nand we're not gonna dive into the security\nside of things in this particular show,\n\n46\n00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.355\nbut that's a whole nother thing that you\nshould keep in mind when you're connecting\n\n47\n00:02:29.355 --> 00:02:31.390\nto wireless networks is, is it secure?\n\n48\n00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:32.820\nI'll kinda mention it here.\n\n49\n00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:37.020\nYou can see this says connected and\nsecured.\n\n50\n00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.480\nThey don't have the little\nlock icon anymore.\n\n51\n00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.790\nThey've kinda taken that away, but\nit just says the word Secured.\n\n52\n00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.870\nAnd so, that's a good thing.\n\n53\n00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.180\nAnd what that usually means is\nit's gonna require authentication.\n\n54\n00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.570\nSo I have to prove who I am\nbefore I'm allowed to connect.\n\n55\n00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.360\nThat means it's controlled access.\n\n56\n00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.690\nAlso means it's probably encrypted.\n\n57\n00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.100\nBut that's something that\nyou would have to find out.\n\n58\n00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.580\nBut definitely wanna keep an eye out for,\nyou don't wanna see Unsecured.\n\n59\n00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:07.430\nIf you do, maybe you're in an airport or\na coffee shop and\n\n60\n00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.160\nthe only network around is unsecured.\n\n61\n00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.760\nYou could probably connect to it, but\n\n62\n00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.165\njust be real careful about\nwhat you do over that network.\n\n63\n00:03:14.165 --> 00:03:15.321\nYou don't wanna be transmitting-\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n64\n00:03:15.321 --> 00:03:18.065\nusually if you're working\non important information,\n\n65\n00:03:18.065 --> 00:03:21.157\nyou'll probably already have\na VPN connection set up for you,\n\n66\n00:03:21.157 --> 00:03:25.610\nbut like Mike said, that's another story.\n&gt;&gt; I mean I connect to open access\n\n67\n00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:29.570\npoints all the time, but then I don't turn\naround and open up my banking app and\n\n68\n00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:31.550\ntype in the password to my bank account.\n\n69\n00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:36.230\nOr connect to any other resources that\ncould potentially expose sensitive data or\n\n70\n00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:39.500\nrequire me to authenticate, because I\ndon't trust the network at this point.\n\n71\n00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.010\nSo definitely keep that in mind,\ncheck out Security Plus.\n\n72\n00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.240\nI know we cover it pretty good in there.\n\n73\n00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:46.973\nAll right, so back to Windows 10.\n\n74\n00:03:46.973 --> 00:03:49.230\nSo we've got this list\nof wireless networks.\n\n75\n00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.640\nAnd basically what Windows is\ndoing is it's got a radio in it.\n\n76\n00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.870\nObviously if I'm gonna connect to\na wireless network, I need a wireless\n\n77\n00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:00.660\nadapter, whether that's built into my\nlaptop or whether that's an external card.\n\n78\n00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:02.550\nOr yeah, something like that.\n\n79\n00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:04.590\nMaybe it's a USB-type device.\n\n80\n00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.580\nBut I need some way to connect to and\nreceive wireless signals.\n\n81\n00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:09.414\nOnce I do that,\n\n82\n00:04:09.414 --> 00:04:13.148\nWindows is gonna show me all\nthe wireless networks that are in range.\n\n83\n00:04:13.148 --> 00:04:15.681\nSo what that means is where\nI'm standing right now,\n\n84\n00:04:15.681 --> 00:04:17.940\nall of these networks are reachable,\nright?\n\n85\n00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.270\nThey're close enough to me that\nI can pick up their signal.\n\n86\n00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:25.590\nAnd you can see some of these down\nhere have a very, very weak signal.\n\n87\n00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:29.349\nAs I go further down the list,\nthere's oops, when I zoom, it only zooms,\n\n88\n00:04:29.349 --> 00:04:30.494\nlet me try that again.\n\n89\n00:04:32.905 --> 00:04:34.580\nThat's funny.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n90\n00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:36.760\n&gt;&gt; Let's try to do zoom first, and\n\n91\n00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:38.950\nthen click on it.\n\n92\n00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:41.090\nVery strange.\n&gt;&gt; Still it's like?\n\n93\n00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:42.656\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's not zooming in\n\n94\n00:04:42.656 --> 00:04:45.243\non my slide-outs, but\nyou can see the little\n\n95\n00:04:45.243 --> 00:04:50.000\nsymbol doesn't have as many bars on it\nif you will for lack of a better term.\n\n96\n00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.640\nThere's an example of one that's open,\nright?\n\n97\n00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:54.970\nI can see it's open,\nit doesn't say Secured.\n\n98\n00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:58.084\nAnd it's got a little shield on it,\ntelling me, hey, be careful,\n\n99\n00:04:58.084 --> 00:05:00.170\nyou might not want to connect.\n\n100\n00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:03.050\nSo what this is showing me is\nthe wireless networks that are in range.\n\n101\n00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:05.272\nAnd which ones are the closest and\n\n102\n00:05:05.272 --> 00:05:09.490\nwhich ones have the strongest\nsignal from where I'm at.\n\n103\n00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:12.370\nAnd I can select one to connect to it.\n\n104\n00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:15.340\nSimply click on the name and\nclick Connect.\n\n105\n00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:17.400\nAnd then assuming that\nI know the password,\n\n106\n00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:22.100\nif it's required, I'm now connected\nto ITProTV Guest network, right?\n\n107\n00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:26.070\nIf I wanna switch back, I go to ITProTV,\nand I can click Connect.\n\n108\n00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:28.780\nSo connecting to a wireless network,\nat the bare minimum or\n\n109\n00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:32.540\nthe basic level,\nis simply making sure your laptop or\n\n110\n00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:37.150\nwhatever device it is has wireless\ncapabilities and that they're enabled.\n\n111\n00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:41.960\nI've seen many laptops that have soft keys\nor strange places for keys to turn off\n\n112\n00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:46.860\nthe radio, so if you're troubleshooting.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, like weird places,\n\n113\n00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:49.522\nlike somewhere where it might\nget caught on a sleeve or\n\n114\n00:05:49.522 --> 00:05:54.730\nreally inconspicuous locations where\npeople might not automatically notice.\n\n115\n00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:57.620\nAnd then you gotta just look up their\nmake and model of their laptop and\n\n116\n00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:01.330\nsee where that little toggle switch may\nbe located if it's a physical button they\n\n117\n00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:03.430\nmight have hit, or\neven like you said, on the keyboard.\n\n118\n00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:05.260\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and it's very handy to have.\n\n119\n00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:09.232\nWhen I wanna make sure wireless is\ndisabled and I'm in an untrusted place,\n\n120\n00:06:09.232 --> 00:06:12.840\nI wanna kill wireless altogether,\nI like having that capability.\n\n121\n00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:15.582\nBut my Alienware had a soft\nkey across the top, and\n\n122\n00:06:15.582 --> 00:06:19.970\nit was right where I used to put my thumb,\nand I would kill wireless all the time.\n\n123\n00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:22.748\nIn the middle of doing things,\nI would turn wireless off.\n\n124\n00:06:22.748 --> 00:06:26.950\nHad another, an older IBM ThinkPad that\nI was troubleshooting for somebody and\n\n125\n00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:31.840\ntrying to connect to the wireless network,\nand I had gone through everything.\n\n126\n00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:34.585\nBanging my head, trying to figure out\nwhy this machine wouldn't connect.\n\n127\n00:06:34.585 --> 00:06:37.550\nCome to find out,\nthe radio was disabled altogether.\n\n128\n00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:40.000\nAnd on the bottom,\nyou flipped it over, and\n\n129\n00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.330\nthere was a little slider switch where\nyou could turn that radio on and off,\n\n130\n00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:45.800\nso something to keep in mind.\n&gt;&gt; Good times.\n\n131\n00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:47.082\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, at its basic,\n\n132\n00:06:47.082 --> 00:06:50.792\naccording to our objectives,\nconnect to wireless network,\n\n133\n00:06:50.792 --> 00:06:56.480\nhave wireless capability, make sure it's\nturned on, make sure you're in range.\n\n134\n00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:59.580\nIf it's secured, you're gonna need\na little more information like the pass\n\n135\n00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:01.500\nphrase or a certificate.\n\n136\n00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:06.470\nOr whatever they're using to authenticate\nthat connection to that access point.\n\n137\n00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:07.750\nTrying to think if there's one, let's see.\n\n138\n00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:11.340\nI don't think I've connected\nto this one recently.\n\n139\n00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:15.210\nThere you go, so the ITProTV Guest,\nI've connected to before.\n\n140\n00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:19.420\nAnd I've told it to save that pass phrase,\nso it didn't ask me when I switched to it.\n\n141\n00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:21.570\nThis one I haven't\nconnected to in a while.\n\n142\n00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:23.390\nSo it doesn't have that security key.\n\n143\n00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:26.020\nSo it says Secured, but\nI can't just connect to it.\n\n144\n00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:31.440\nI have to know the key in order for\nme to connect to that network, all right?\n\n145\n00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:35.530\nSo those are all the networks\nthat are in range.\n\n146\n00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:37.270\nNow Cherokee, to your point earlier.\n\n147\n00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:42.499\nWe can end up getting in a situation where\nthere's a lot of networks in range, right?\n\n148\n00:07:42.499 --> 00:07:48.145\nIt's like nowadays, well, heck, just\nstanding here in this studio, I see two\n\n149\n00:07:48.145 --> 00:07:51.505\nfor our organization, I see another one.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n150\n00:07:51.505 --> 00:07:54.871\nour building is not extremely dense\nas far as population goes, but\n\n151\n00:07:54.871 --> 00:07:57.740\nI've been in buildings\nthat are extremely dense.\n\n152\n00:07:57.740 --> 00:08:02.515\nSo you could see quite a few.\n&gt;&gt;

Time of day,\n\n167\n00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:47.490\nusage.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and\n\n168\n00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:49.670\nam I holding my mouth correctly?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n169\n00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:51.591\n&gt;&gt; Was I suppose to stand on one foot?\n\n170\n00:08:51.591 --> 00:08:55.815\nHow do I make sure that it connects\nto ITProTV first, every time?\n\n171\n00:08:55.815 --> 00:08:59.250\nThis is what l want to be my\npreferred wireless network.\n\n172\n00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:02.470\nIf it's unavailable, sure,\ntry some of these others.\n\n173\n00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:03.925\nSo how do l control that?\n\n174\n00:09:03.925 --> 00:09:08.631\nAnd that's actually done,\nunfortunately, not through the GUI.\n\n175\n00:09:08.631 --> 00:09:09.727\nIt's crazy, isn't it?\n\n176\n00:09:09.727 --> 00:09:11.997\nl'm gonna open up my network and Internet.\n\n177\n00:09:11.997 --> 00:09:16.673\nI'm gonna go over here to Wi-Fi, and I'm\ngonna click on Show available networks.\n\n178\n00:09:16.673 --> 00:09:18.280\nAnd see what it does?\n\n179\n00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:21.430\nIt takes me right back to\nthat same slide out window.\n\n180\n00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:25.411\nAnd I can't click and\ndrag these to change the order.\n\n181\n00:09:25.411 --> 00:09:25.993\n&gt;&gt; Right-click or\n\n182\n00:09:25.993 --> 00:09:26.616\nanything?\n&gt;&gt; No,\n\n183\n00:09:26.616 --> 00:09:29.970\nall it does is just gonna allow me\nto connect if I right-click on it.\n\n184\n00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:33.460\nSo this list is basically\nsorted by strength.\n\n185\n00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:39.270\nIt's showing me the strongest one first,\nand then the weaker ones after that.\n\n186\n00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:41.220\nThat's the idea anyway.\n\n187\n00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:46.853\nSo if I want to manage,\nI can click Manage known networks.\n\n188\n00:09:46.853 --> 00:09:50.093\nAnd here I can, and let me do that again.\n\n189\n00:09:50.093 --> 00:09:51.380\nI did that a little quick.\n\n190\n00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:54.040\nManage known networks, I'm on Wi-Fi still.\n\n191\n00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:55.700\nManage known networks,\n\n192\n00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:58.350\nhere's all the different networks\nthat my machine knows about.\n\n193\n00:09:58.350 --> 00:10:02.641\nSo it has remembered these networks\nthat I've connected to before.\n\n194\n00:10:02.641 --> 00:10:04.880\nAnd you can see Sort by preference.\n\n195\n00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:08.850\nI can sort it by Name, and\nI can sort it by Source.\n\n196\n00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:12.530\nBut I can't change the order\nof these guys, right?\n\n197\n00:10:12.530 --> 00:10:14.330\nIt's just showing me all the networks.\n\n198\n00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:18.440\nAnd if I click on one, I can pull up\nthe properties for that network and\n\n199\n00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:20.125\ntell it to connect automatically.\n\n200\n00:10:20.125 --> 00:10:24.990\nAnd some other settings that we don't need\nto worry about for now, randomizing my\n\n201\n00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:29.070\nhardware address, whether or not this\nis a billed or metered connection.\n\n202\n00:10:29.070 --> 00:10:31.400\nBut I can't set the priority.\n\n203\n00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:33.940\nNo way to say hey,\nconnect to this one first.\n\n204\n00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:36.970\nAnd then, if that's unavailable,\nconnect to a different one.\n\n205\n00:10:36.970 --> 00:10:42.250\nSo as far as managing wireless goes, in\nhere, I can tell it to forget a network.\n\n206\n00:10:42.250 --> 00:10:46.010\nI connected to this free Wi-Fi,\nI don't know when.\n\n207\n00:10:46.010 --> 00:10:48.638\nProbably was desperate for\na Wi-Fi connection and said,\n\n208\n00:10:48.638 --> 00:10:49.824\nI'm gonna try it anyway.\n\n209\n00:10:49.824 --> 00:10:51.556\nI hope it's-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I gotta have my fix.\n\n210\n00:10:51.556 --> 00:10:53.546\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I've gotta post something on\n\n211\n00:10:53.546 --> 00:10:55.890\nTwitter and I just have to connect.\n\n212\n00:10:55.890 --> 00:10:57.900\nI don't want it to ever\nconnect to that again.\n\n213\n00:10:57.900 --> 00:10:59.042\nI don't even know where it was.\n\n214\n00:10:59.042 --> 00:11:01.691\nI can click Forget,\nget it out of the list.\n\n215\n00:11:01.691 --> 00:11:03.687\nNow, it's gone.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That was 3 AM on a Friday\n\n216\n00:11:03.687 --> 00:11:07.081\nnight, and Mike just had to get online.\n&gt;&gt; Sitting at the airport, and\n\n217\n00:11:07.081 --> 00:11:09.378\nI really wanted to check out LinkedIn.\n\n218\n00:11:09.378 --> 00:11:13.230\nOr ITProTV,\nI was hoping to watch an episode.\n\n219\n00:11:13.230 --> 00:11:17.000\nSo you can remove networks from that list,\nyou click Forget.\n\n220\n00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.860\nNow, if I show up at\nwherever that network was,\n\n221\n00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:22.930\nif I show up there again,\nit recognizes it as a new network.\n\n222\n00:11:22.930 --> 00:11:25.822\nAnd it will ask me all those\nquestions all over again.\n\n223\n00:11:25.822 --> 00:11:30.220\nIn a previous episode, we had talked\nabout how I can choose public or\n\n224\n00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:32.492\nprivate the first time\nI connect to a network.\n\n225\n00:11:32.492 --> 00:11:36.370\nAnd I showed you where to make that\nchange if you select it incorrectly or\n\n226\n00:11:36.370 --> 00:11:37.740\nchanged your mind.\n\n227\n00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:39.470\nOne thing you could do\nis forget the network.\n\n228\n00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:42.360\nIf it's a wireless network,\nyou can come in here and forget it.\n\n229\n00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:44.440\nThen the next time you go to that network-\n&gt;&gt; Will it ask you again?\n\n230\n00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:46.548\n&gt;&gt; It's like ooh, a new network.\n\n231\n00:11:46.548 --> 00:11:49.150\nI've never seen this before,\ndo you want it public or private?\n\n232\n00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:52.070\nAnd yes, it will ask you all over again.\n\n233\n00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:55.770\nSo still no closer to\ncontrolling my priorities.\n\n234\n00:11:55.770 --> 00:11:56.795\n&gt;&gt; Right, how do we do that Mike?\n\n235\n00:11:56.795 --> 00:11:57.401\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n236\n00:11:57.401 --> 00:12:01.805\nwe've seen how we can do some\nmanagement of our wireless networks.\n\n237\n00:12:01.805 --> 00:12:07.125\nAll right, so if we want to manage\nthe priorities, we break out PowerShell.\n\n238\n00:12:07.125 --> 00:12:10.700\nYay, I love PowerShell,\nyou guys know that.\n\n239\n00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:15.640\nI'm just teasing, because it is something\nthat I find odd that's not in the GUI.\n\n240\n00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:17.818\nBut that's the way Microsoft\ndevelops nowadays, right?\n\n241\n00:12:17.818 --> 00:12:21.050\nPowerShell first, GUI if we have time.\n\n242\n00:12:21.050 --> 00:12:23.670\nBecause everything should\nbe done through PowerShell.\n\n243\n00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:26.150\nAll right, so what we do is,\nwe're gonna actually use,\n\n244\n00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:28.460\neven though I'm in PowerShell,\nit's an old school command.\n\n245\n00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:29.940\nSo those of you that have done this,\nbeen around for\n\n246\n00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:31.898\na little while, you'll remember this one.\n\n247\n00:12:31.898 --> 00:12:35.787\nnetsh wlan show profiles.\n\n248\n00:12:35.787 --> 00:12:38.810\nHow many of you, raise your hand\nif you remember good old netsh.\n\n249\n00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:41.902\nCherokee is raising her hand, good job.\n\n250\n00:12:41.902 --> 00:12:44.400\nAll right [LAUGH], so wlan-\n&gt;&gt; So this will work in command-line\n\n251\n00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:45.880\ntoo if you feel-\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n252\n00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:48.012\n&gt;&gt; Just really emotionally attached\n\n253\n00:12:48.012 --> 00:12:51.470\nto your command prompt,\nthen you're good to go there.\n\n254\n00:12:51.470 --> 00:12:56.350\nBut really, there's no need to, but-\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, it's funny because I was\n\n255\n00:12:56.350 --> 00:12:59.280\nactually working with this earlier,\nmaking sure I had my demos ready.\n\n256\n00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:01.920\nI was like, there's gotta be\na PowerShell way to do this.\n\n257\n00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:03.700\nBecause everything's PowerShell, right?\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n258\n00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:04.450\n&gt;&gt; We're trying to lose\n\n259\n00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:06.910\nthe command prompt,\nI don't wanna depend on it any more.\n\n260\n00:13:06.910 --> 00:13:09.137\nAnd I found a couple\nforum posts were like,\n\n261\n00:13:09.137 --> 00:13:11.765\nwork with your wireless\nprofiles through PowerShell.\n\n262\n00:13:11.765 --> 00:13:16.015\nAnd you know what they were doing,\nopening up PowerShell and typing in netsh.\n\n263\n00:13:16.015 --> 00:13:17.040\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n264\n00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:18.090\n&gt;&gt; I'm like all right,\n\n265\n00:13:18.090 --> 00:13:19.650\nthat's not really PowerShell.\n\n266\n00:13:19.650 --> 00:13:23.970\nThat's just because PowerShell can allow\nyou to run command prompts and commands.\n\n267\n00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:25.370\nIt's not what I was looking for.\n\n268\n00:13:25.370 --> 00:13:30.100\nAnyway, back to the topic at hand,\nI'll digress for a second here.\n\n269\n00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:33.896\nnetsh is the command\nthat we are going to use.\n\n270\n00:13:33.896 --> 00:13:39.630\nwlan, and I can zoom in for\nyou there, netsh wlan show profiles.\n\n271\n00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:42.740\nI'll zoom out, I'll hit Enter.\n\n272\n00:13:42.740 --> 00:13:45.630\nAnd what this is gonna do,\nthis is gonna show me all of the profiles.\n\n273\n00:13:45.630 --> 00:13:50.870\nThat should look familiar to\nthis list over here, right?\n\n274\n00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:52.320\nIt's actually missing a couple.\n\n275\n00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:55.440\nThese are networks that are in range, but\n\n276\n00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:58.310\nnot necessarily ones\nI've connected to yet.\n\n277\n00:13:58.310 --> 00:14:01.530\nThese, where I have profiles,\nmeans I've connected to them.\n\n278\n00:14:01.530 --> 00:14:05.600\nThey're not necessarily in range, so-\n&gt;&gt; And we can take bets on which\n\n279\n00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:09.245\nones are yours and which ones are not.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right?\n\n280\n00:14:09.245 --> 00:14:10.115\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n281\n00:14:10.115 --> 00:14:12.780\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n282\n00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:15.010\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you can see I've taken my laptop\n\n283\n00:14:15.010 --> 00:14:16.940\nout to Vegas with me on my last trip.\n\n284\n00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:20.571\nSo MGM Resports Wi-Fi is\ndefinitely there on the list.\n\n285\n00:14:20.571 --> 00:14:22.812\nThere's SkyNet-\n&gt;&gt; No Skynet,\n\n286\n00:14:22.812 --> 00:14:25.905\nI'm definitely going with\nRebel Alliance there, buddy.\n\n287\n00:14:25.905 --> 00:14:26.947\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n288\n00:14:26.947 --> 00:14:32.220\nI like to have a little fun when\nI name by wireless networks.\n\n289\n00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:35.390\nI had one named FBI Surveillance Van.\n&gt;&gt; That's\n\n290\n00:14:35.390 --> 00:14:36.354\nalways a good time.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n291\n00:14:36.354 --> 00:14:36.854\nyeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n292\n00:14:36.854 --> 00:14:38.144\n&gt;&gt; Nobody's gonna try to connect to that\n\n293\n00:14:38.144 --> 00:14:39.060\none hopefully, right?\n\n294\n00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:41.270\nBut yeah, so\nthese are the different profiles.\n\n295\n00:14:41.270 --> 00:14:43.050\nAnd again, I misspoke.\n\n296\n00:14:43.050 --> 00:14:45.500\nI was gonna say look,\nthese look exactly the same.\n\n297\n00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:47.180\nThey look nothing like each other.\n\n298\n00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:50.270\nBecause this is the list of\nnetworks that are in range,\n\n299\n00:14:50.270 --> 00:14:52.740\nnot necessarily that I've connected.\n\n300\n00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:55.210\nProfiles are for\nnetworks that I've connected to.\n\n301\n00:14:55.210 --> 00:14:59.460\nEven ones that are no longer in range\nstill have a profile saved on my computer,\n\n302\n00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:01.890\nfor when I go back out to Vegas next year.\n\n303\n00:15:01.890 --> 00:15:04.191\nSee you guys there January 20-something.\n\n304\n00:15:04.191 --> 00:15:05.510\nNo, just kidding.\n\n305\n00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:09.000\nSo where was I going with this?\n\n306\n00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:10.330\nI got thinking about Vegas and\n\n307\n00:15:10.330 --> 00:15:12.040\ngot completely side tracked.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n308\n00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:13.280\n&gt;&gt; So this allows me to show\n\n309\n00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:14.210\nthose profiles.\n\n310\n00:15:14.210 --> 00:15:18.550\nSo the idea was how do I control this?\n\n311\n00:15:18.550 --> 00:15:23.050\nIt doesn't look like it, but\nthere's actually an order to this list.\n\n312\n00:15:23.050 --> 00:15:26.010\nThank you, Microsoft for\nmaking that very obvious for us.\n\n313\n00:15:26.010 --> 00:15:29.260\nBut this list is actually\nsorted by priority.\n\n314\n00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:33.578\nSo in other words when you run this\ncommand and it returns all those profiles,\n\n315\n00:15:33.578 --> 00:15:36.182\nthe one at the top of\nthe list has priority one.\n\n316\n00:15:36.182 --> 00:15:38.390\n&gt;&gt; What is that, chronological order or\n\n317\n00:15:38.390 --> 00:15:39.417\nsomething?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n318\n00:15:39.417 --> 00:15:40.100\nI don't know.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n319\n00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:41.820\n&gt;&gt; I don't know how it determines this.\n\n320\n00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:45.130\nBut it will, my computer is always\nlooking for this one first.\n\n321\n00:15:45.130 --> 00:15:48.030\nIf that's not there,\nit's gonna try to connect to this.\n\n322\n00:15:48.030 --> 00:15:53.059\nIf that's not there, it's gonna connect to\nthis, and so on down the list, all right?\n\n323\n00:15:53.059 --> 00:15:55.840\nSo there is a priority.\n\n324\n00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:57.640\nMicrosoft doesn't make it real obvious.\n\n325\n00:15:57.640 --> 00:16:02.230\nWe can change that priority by\nusing netsh as well, all right?\n\n326\n00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:06.400\nFor example, let's say I wanna move\nITProTV, To the top of my list.\n\n327\n00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:09.510\nI want it to always try\nthat network first.\n\n328\n00:16:09.510 --> 00:16:12.660\nWe're going to do netsh.\n&gt;&gt; And that's because you go to work\n\n329\n00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:16.200\nmore than you go to Vegas?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH],\n\n330\n00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:18.950\nI got to go to work to pay for Vegas.\n\n331\n00:16:18.950 --> 00:16:20.830\nSo yeah probably.\n\n332\n00:16:20.830 --> 00:16:23.640\nWlan and then set.\n\n333\n00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:29.460\nAnd then profile order, oops,\nif I can spell that right,\n\n334\n00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:34.700\nthat is HW lan, profile order,\nname equals quote.\n\n335\n00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:36.110\nWhich one am I trying to change?\n\n336\n00:16:36.110 --> 00:16:37.570\nWhich profile?\n\n337\n00:16:37.570 --> 00:16:39.060\nLet's say IT Pro TV.\n\n338\n00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:44.250\nIt's not case sensitive, Notice I\ndidn't do capital letters there, right.\n\n339\n00:16:44.250 --> 00:16:50.260\nAnd then interface equals open quote,\nwhat interface?\n\n340\n00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:52.470\nYou might have more than one\nwireless network adapter.\n\n341\n00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:57.010\nMaybe you want to set ITPro TV as\npriority one on one of the adapters, but\n\n342\n00:16:57.010 --> 00:17:01.020\na different network as priority\non a different adapter, right.\n\n343\n00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:04.250\nI can see my adapter's name right here.\n\n344\n00:17:04.250 --> 00:17:06.396\nIt's actually named y dash five.\n\n345\n00:17:06.396 --> 00:17:11.790\nSo we're gonna do y dash five,\nend quote and\n\n346\n00:17:11.790 --> 00:17:17.360\nthen if I can spell this,\nand evidently I can't,\n\n347\n00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:22.610\npriority, there we go,n equals and\nI'll do a 1.\n\n348\n00:17:22.610 --> 00:17:26.523\nRight, so ITPro TV,\nI'm trying to set to priority one.\n\n349\n00:17:26.523 --> 00:17:32.950\nSo Net sh, wlan, set profile order,\n\n350\n00:17:32.950 --> 00:17:38.150\nname of the profile you're trying to set,\nname of the adapter you're setting it on,\n\n351\n00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:40.900\nand then what you wanna set it to,\nand that should be it.\n\n352\n00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:46.080\nI hit enter, and\nit says it updated successfully.\n\n353\n00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:53.250\nSo if we do another show profiles, look,\nITPRO TV is now the top of the list.\n\n354\n00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:56.570\nSo it will attempt to connect\nto that one first, right.\n\n355\n00:17:56.570 --> 00:18:02.320\nNow, that's about all we have as far as\ncontrol goes over that profile order.\n\n356\n00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:08.900\nI can't really say when I'm in this area,\nmake this one the preferred.\n\n357\n00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:11.920\nBut this is not in the area, right.\n\n358\n00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:15.990\nSo even though it's second,\nI know that it's gonna try this first.\n\n359\n00:18:15.990 --> 00:18:18.480\nWhen I go home,\nI want it to connect to Skynet,\n\n360\n00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:23.980\nI want that to be the one it connects to,\nbut do I bother moving it up?\n\n361\n00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:25.810\nMaybe, maybe I don't, right.\n\n362\n00:18:25.810 --> 00:18:29.760\nBecause MGM resorts is not in the area so\nit's not gonna connect to that.\n\n363\n00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:33.280\nBut maybe it takes it a minute to\nmake sure that's not in the area\n\n364\n00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:34.070\nbefore it connects to this.\n\n365\n00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:35.800\nSo maybe I move Skynet up.\n\n366\n00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:37.748\nSo we do that same command.\n\n367\n00:18:37.748 --> 00:18:42.613\nI can just say Skynet is going\n\n368\n00:18:42.613 --> 00:18:48.270\nto be a priority too, right.\n\n369\n00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:51.565\nAnd now when I show my profiles,\nSkynet is number two.\n\n370\n00:18:51.565 --> 00:18:55.210\nNow you might think,\ndon't you wand Skynet to be number one?\n\n371\n00:18:55.210 --> 00:18:57.050\nYou can only have one number one, right.\n\n372\n00:18:57.050 --> 00:18:59.210\nSo you just kinda have to\nplay with your profiles and\n\n373\n00:18:59.210 --> 00:19:02.280\nset them In the most appropriate order.\n\n374\n00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:03.650\nThis is number one when I'm at work.\n\n375\n00:19:03.650 --> 00:19:06.020\nThis is number one when I'm at home.\n\n376\n00:19:06.020 --> 00:19:08.370\nBut I can't have two at number one.\n\n377\n00:19:08.370 --> 00:19:09.650\nI can also forget them.\n\n378\n00:19:09.650 --> 00:19:12.472\nI can say net sh,\n\n379\n00:19:12.472 --> 00:19:18.360\nwlan delete profile.\n&gt;&gt; Don't delete the mgm one.\n\n380\n00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:20.800\nThat's kinda like a souvenir.\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n381\n00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:23.340\nName equals,\nlet's get rid of that coxWiFi,\n\n382\n00:19:23.340 --> 00:19:25.150\ncuz I don't wanna connect to any coxWiFi.\n\n383\n00:19:25.150 --> 00:19:26.610\nI know that.\n\n384\n00:19:26.610 --> 00:19:29.400\nPull that one up, that's the right one.\n\n385\n00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:32.090\nAnd let's hit enter.\n\n386\n00:19:32.090 --> 00:19:33.110\nAnd it says it's deleted.\n\n387\n00:19:33.110 --> 00:19:38.380\nIf I go back and show my profiles,\nsure enough, it is gone.\n\n388\n00:19:38.380 --> 00:19:41.710\nSo, as far as working with wireless\nnetworks go, pretty straight forward.\n\n389\n00:19:41.710 --> 00:19:46.270\nWe got an icon on our task bar that allows\nme to see the networks that are in range.\n\n390\n00:19:46.270 --> 00:19:49.060\nI can connect to one of those\nnetworks simply by clicking on it.\n\n391\n00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:52.415\nAnd then if it's secured, I will need\nto enter the appropriate information.\n\n392\n00:19:52.415 --> 00:19:57.470\nIt'll also ask me to set my location\npublic or private, I can choose that.\n\n393\n00:19:57.470 --> 00:20:01.658\nTo manage those profiles, though after\nthe fact, to set my priorities on them,\n\n394\n00:20:01.658 --> 00:20:06.220\nNet sh, wlan is going to be\nthe way we can work with those.\n\n395\n00:20:06.220 --> 00:20:08.440\nAll right,\n\n396\n00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:13.350\nthe other thing that is on our objectives\nhere, configure network adapters.\n\n397\n00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:18.910\nI'm not gonna spend too much time in here\nbecause to configure your network adapter,\n\n398\n00:20:18.910 --> 00:20:23.630\nyou simply go into your network and\ninternet settings,\n\n399\n00:20:23.630 --> 00:20:29.320\ngo to your adapters, and\noops, as I goof it up.\n\n400\n00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:32.470\nNo, that's right, I'm not on my VM,\nI don;t have a wire adaptor.\n\n401\n00:20:32.470 --> 00:20:35.990\nLet's jump back over to\nMy Windows 10 machine.\n\n402\n00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:39.750\nLet me log back in and\nwe'll do that again.\n\n403\n00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:40.530\n&gt;&gt; Not typing.\n\n404\n00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:43.340\n&gt;&gt; Try that there a third time.\n\n405\n00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:44.270\nThere we go.\n\n406\n00:20:44.270 --> 00:20:46.890\nAs far as configuring your\nnetwork adapters goes,\n\n407\n00:20:46.890 --> 00:20:49.660\nyou can go to your network and\ninternet settings.\n\n408\n00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:54.500\nGo to ethernet, and\nthen change adapter options.\n\n409\n00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:56.000\nWe've seen this in another episodes.\n\n410\n00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.240\nWe've talked about our TCPIP settings.\n\n411\n00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:01.430\nWe've talked about DNS settings.\n\n412\n00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:04.560\nSo all of those settings are gonna\nbe configured through here.\n\n413\n00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:06.160\nSo go to your network adapter.\n\n414\n00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:10.336\nWhether you go through the control panel,\n\n415\n00:21:10.336 --> 00:21:16.020\nwhether you to your little\niicon down on your system tray,\n\n416\n00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:21.711\nor the other one is what,\nncpa.cpl, oops I can't type.\n\n417\n00:21:21.711 --> 00:21:27.930\nNcpa.cpl will take me right\nto that control panel applet.\n\n418\n00:21:27.930 --> 00:21:30.810\nAnd then from there you're just\nsimply pulling up the properties and\n\n419\n00:21:30.810 --> 00:21:34.960\nconfiguring your settings.\n&gt;&gt; And do they still have the advanced\n\n420\n00:21:36.210 --> 00:21:39.240\nsection where you can add the alternate\nprofile here on Windows 10?\n\n421\n00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:40.360\nJust can't remember.\n\n422\n00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:43.600\nLike if you were swapping between\ndifferent networks, your home and\n\n423\n00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:48.015\nyour work like you were talking about.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, as far as that goes,\n\n424\n00:21:48.015 --> 00:21:50.795\nyou can, let's see,\nI know what you're talking about.\n\n425\n00:21:50.795 --> 00:21:54.414\nYou mean changing your IP address?\n&gt;&gt; Yeap.\n\n426\n00:21:54.414 --> 00:21:58.487\nYou want it static for your work IP.\n&gt;&gt; Only if you do alternate,\n\n427\n00:21:58.487 --> 00:22:00.225\nI mean if you do automatic, right.\n\n428\n00:22:00.225 --> 00:22:03.725\nIf I have a statically mapped IP address,\nand I can't bring that back, so\n\n429\n00:22:03.725 --> 00:22:05.615\nlet undo those changes.\n\n430\n00:22:05.615 --> 00:22:07.900\nIf you're statically mapped,\nthis is all you get.\n\n431\n00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:11.570\nYou can really only have one\nstatically mapped IP address.\n\n432\n00:22:11.570 --> 00:22:16.160\nIf you obtain an IP address automatically,\nright, then you get this new tab.\n\n433\n00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:18.280\nSee how that disappears and shows up?\n\n434\n00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:21.590\nI don't know if you guys can see that,\nlet me zoom in.\n\n435\n00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:26.390\nThat alternate configuration tab,\nwatch that as I click this one and\n\n436\n00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:27.390\nthen click this one.\n\n437\n00:22:27.390 --> 00:22:30.820\nRight, so if I'm obtaining\nan IP address automatically,\n\n438\n00:22:30.820 --> 00:22:33.700\nI do get this alternate configuration tab.\n\n439\n00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:38.520\nAnd here I can configure an alternate\nIP address, a statically mapped.\n\n440\n00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:43.560\nSo basically, what I'm saying is, by\ndefault try to talk to the DHCP server and\n\n441\n00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:46.020\nget your TCPIP configuration.\n\n442\n00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:49.450\nIf that doesn't work,\nhere's an alternate configuration.\n\n443\n00:22:49.450 --> 00:22:52.860\nThis used to be really\ncommon back in the day when\n\n444\n00:22:52.860 --> 00:22:56.580\nour home networks weren't running DHCP,\nright.\n\n445\n00:22:56.580 --> 00:23:00.740\nAnd we had like an ISDN connection or\nsomething like that where we had\n\n446\n00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:04.290\na specific IP address that we had to\nuse to get our internet connection.\n\n447\n00:23:04.290 --> 00:23:09.300\nBut when we got to work, we couldn't use\nthat IP address, so we had to switch\n\n448\n00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:14.640\nit to DHCP, and\nthis would allow you to use DHCP at work.\n\n449\n00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:17.710\nAnd then when you got home, no DHCP.\n\n450\n00:23:17.710 --> 00:23:21.200\nUse the alternate configuration, right.\n\n451\n00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:24.981\nStill see that used sometimes with certain\nsatellite connections where you've got to\n\n452\n00:23:24.981 --> 00:23:30.180\nstatically map it, but just understand\nthat you can't statically map two, right.\n\n453\n00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:37.200\nAs soon as I statically map this one, that\nalternate configuration tab goes away.\n\n454\n00:23:38.990 --> 00:23:43.530\nAll right, last thing I want to show\nyou is location aware printing.\n\n455\n00:23:43.530 --> 00:23:45.840\n&gt;&gt; This is your favorite.\n\n456\n00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:46.910\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, is, it was,\n\n457\n00:23:46.910 --> 00:23:50.210\nmaybe I should say,\nbecause they've taken it away.\n\n458\n00:23:50.210 --> 00:23:52.185\nWell, they've changed it, I should say.\n\n459\n00:23:52.185 --> 00:23:54.050\nThey've changed in a way\nthat doesn't make me happy.\n\n460\n00:23:54.050 --> 00:23:55.262\nBut they didn't ask me.\n\n461\n00:23:55.262 --> 00:23:57.010\nIt's not my Windows 10.\n\n462\n00:23:57.010 --> 00:23:58.780\nSo let's talk about that though.\n\n463\n00:23:58.780 --> 00:24:00.610\nLet me open up my printers.\n\n464\n00:24:00.610 --> 00:24:05.020\nI'm gonna type in printers from my\nstart menu and go to printers and\n\n465\n00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:07.000\nscanners systems settings.\n\n466\n00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:11.390\nAll right,\nin this dialogue box I can see printers.\n\n467\n00:24:11.390 --> 00:24:13.270\nThis is my VM isn't it?\n\n468\n00:24:13.270 --> 00:24:17.900\nLet's go to my physical machine cuz we'll\nhave a little more exciting things to look\n\n469\n00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:20.450\nat.\n&gt;&gt; I never heard printers and excitement\n\n470\n00:24:20.450 --> 00:24:23.300\nin the same sentence before, Mike.\n&gt;&gt; You know me.\n\n471\n00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:24.730\n&gt;&gt; Usually it's the opposite\n\n472\n00:24:24.730 --> 00:24:28.130\nthere when we're talking about printers.\n&gt;&gt; I can talk loudly about printers but\n\n473\n00:24:28.130 --> 00:24:31.170\nit's usually not something\nthat's appropriate for camera.\n\n474\n00:24:31.170 --> 00:24:32.650\nYeah I'm not a huge,\n\n475\n00:24:32.650 --> 00:24:37.960\nI don't like working with printers, but\nwe're gonna try to make it exciting.\n\n476\n00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:40.060\nSo here's my printers and\nscanners on my laptop and\n\n477\n00:24:40.060 --> 00:24:43.990\nI can see the different printers and\nscanners that I've connected to.\n\n478\n00:24:43.990 --> 00:24:48.380\nAnd the idea is, or\naccording to their objectives,\n\n479\n00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:51.148\nthey want you to configure\nlocation to where printing.\n\n480\n00:24:51.148 --> 00:24:55.720\nWell, you can't because\nit's not there anymore.\n\n481\n00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:56.260\nThey took it away.\n\n482\n00:24:56.260 --> 00:24:59.540\nLet me tell you what it was and I'll\ntell you what they've replaced it with.\n\n483\n00:24:59.540 --> 00:25:03.060\nSo if on the exam they ask you about\nlocation where printing, you'll at least\n\n484\n00:25:03.060 --> 00:25:07.070\nbe able to say, yeah I know about that and\nyou can answer questions.\n\n485\n00:25:07.070 --> 00:25:09.980\nOr if they ask you about the new way,\nyou'll know about that one, and\n\n486\n00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:11.430\nyou can answer those questions.\n\n487\n00:25:11.430 --> 00:25:14.185\nAll right, used to be, now that one go.\n\n488\n00:25:14.185 --> 00:25:16.161\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Will you tell us a story,\n\n489\n00:25:16.161 --> 00:25:19.652\na story that I like.\n&gt;&gt; So in Sicily in1932,\n\n490\n00:25:19.652 --> 00:25:24.497\nlocation where we're printing,\nthe idea was is that my computer\n\n491\n00:25:24.497 --> 00:25:30.000\nknows where it's at based on\nthe network that it's connected to.\n\n492\n00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:33.550\nAnd I used to be able to set\na different default printer for\n\n493\n00:25:33.550 --> 00:25:35.860\neach network that I connected to.\n\n494\n00:25:35.860 --> 00:25:39.670\nSo that when I got to work, it would go,\nyou're on the work network.\n\n495\n00:25:39.670 --> 00:25:43.180\nI'm gonna switch your default\nprinter to that black and\n\n496\n00:25:43.180 --> 00:25:45.080\nwhite ITProTV office printer.\n\n497\n00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:50.090\nBut when you go home, I'm gonna detect\nthat now you're on a different network and\n\n498\n00:25:50.090 --> 00:25:50.890\nthe default printer for\n\n499\n00:25:50.890 --> 00:25:56.170\nthis network is that Inkjet that\nyou've got sitting there, right?\n\n500\n00:25:56.170 --> 00:25:57.350\nAnd that was great.\n\n501\n00:25:57.350 --> 00:26:02.130\nI really liked that because I didn't have\nto worry about when I opened up Word or\n\n502\n00:26:02.130 --> 00:26:05.500\nsomething and I just clicked print,\nit was gonna go to the right printer.\n\n503\n00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:07.250\nIf I'm at work,\nit knew the default printer.\n\n504\n00:26:07.250 --> 00:26:09.440\nIf I'm at home,\nit knew the default printer.\n\n505\n00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:10.710\nIt was great.\n\n506\n00:26:10.710 --> 00:26:12.310\nNow you can't do that anymore, right?\n\n507\n00:26:12.310 --> 00:26:15.080\nBasically, Windows says\nit's gonna do it for you.\n\n508\n00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:18.630\nLet Windows manage my default printer.\n\n509\n00:26:18.630 --> 00:26:24.644\nThat is the default option for printers\nand it's doing kind of the same thing.\n\n510\n00:26:24.644 --> 00:26:27.287\nAnd read what it says here.\n\n511\n00:26:27.287 --> 00:26:31.359\nWhen this is on, Windows will set you\ndefault printer to be the one you used\n\n512\n00:26:31.359 --> 00:26:34.650\nmost recently at your current location.\n\n513\n00:26:34.650 --> 00:26:38.700\nSo kind of sort of doing\nlocation aware printing.\n\n514\n00:26:38.700 --> 00:26:43.660\nIt know that the last time I was on the\nwork network, I printed to that black and\n\n515\n00:26:43.660 --> 00:26:45.410\nwhite ITProTV printer.\n\n516\n00:26:45.410 --> 00:26:49.550\nSo if I just click print on something,\nit's gonna default to that printer.\n\n517\n00:26:49.550 --> 00:26:54.930\nIt knows when I get own the last printer I\nuse at my home network was that laser jet.\n\n518\n00:26:54.930 --> 00:26:56.870\nAnd so it gonna set that\nto my default printer and\n\n519\n00:26:56.870 --> 00:27:01.330\nI'll still be able to print, so we'd be\nlike, well Mike it sounds like the exact\n\n520\n00:27:01.330 --> 00:27:04.340\nsame things what's the difference?\n&gt;&gt; I've had an issue.\n\n521\n00:27:04.340 --> 00:27:05.492\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I bet you have.\n\n522\n00:27:05.492 --> 00:27:07.597\n[LAUGH] Tell us about it.\n&gt;&gt; No, but\n\n523\n00:27:07.597 --> 00:27:10.503\nseriously though I tried to print\nsomething out at home come into work.\n\n524\n00:27:10.503 --> 00:27:13.852\nAnd maybe if it didn't print and\nthen I had to go in and\n\n525\n00:27:13.852 --> 00:27:18.746\nchange manually, select an alternative,\nmy home printer come into work.\n\n526\n00:27:18.746 --> 00:27:23.801\nif I hadn't cleared out my printing\nqueue and was just sitting there teed up\n\n527\n00:27:23.801 --> 00:27:29.270\nin my print jobs, come into work, sit\ndown, relax, printer kicks off at work.\n\n528\n00:27:29.270 --> 00:27:30.800\nI'm like, I didn't print anything.\n\n529\n00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:34.430\nSure enough, there was that job that\nI forgot to delete sitting there.\n\n530\n00:27:34.430 --> 00:27:35.510\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a good point.\n\n531\n00:27:35.510 --> 00:27:36.390\n&gt;&gt; I mean, what a huge issue.\n\n532\n00:27:36.390 --> 00:27:37.680\nBut it's something that could happen.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n533\n00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:40.400\nI mean you could've had sensitive\ninformation that you didn't realize didn't\n\n534\n00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:40.930\nprint at home.\n\n535\n00:27:40.930 --> 00:27:43.770\nThen you get to work or vice versa.\n&gt;&gt; Like my resume for\n\n536\n00:27:43.770 --> 00:27:46.120\nthe new job that I just applied for.\n&gt;&gt; Hey, wait a second.\n\n537\n00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:48.340\nTim, are you listening to this?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n538\n00:27:48.340 --> 00:27:49.680\n&gt;&gt; What's that?\n\n539\n00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:51.490\nYeah, so that's definitely an issue.\n\n540\n00:27:51.490 --> 00:27:54.590\nAnother issue you can run into\nis let's say I'm at work, and\n\n541\n00:27:54.590 --> 00:27:59.600\nI'm supposed to be using this good old\nblack and white printer, but there is\n\n542\n00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:05.550\na really nice color printer here as well\nthat we can only use for certain things.\n\n543\n00:28:05.550 --> 00:28:09.730\nWell let's say the last thing I have\nprinted was to that color printer.\n\n544\n00:28:09.730 --> 00:28:13.410\nAnd then later on that day or\nI come back tomorrow and\n\n545\n00:28:13.410 --> 00:28:16.870\nI need to print a 100-page document,\nright?\n\n546\n00:28:16.870 --> 00:28:18.580\nSome briefs we're printing out or\nsomething, and\n\n547\n00:28:18.580 --> 00:28:21.852\nI just go print-\n&gt;&gt; I have already been warned.\n\n548\n00:28:21.852 --> 00:28:22.993\n&gt;&gt; And guess what, yeah,\n\n549\n00:28:22.993 --> 00:28:25.804\nI might be needing to chose\nyour resume tool at this point.\n\n550\n00:28:25.804 --> 00:28:28.830\n[LAUGH] Because I could be in trouble for\nprinting that.\n\n551\n00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:34.540\nSo keep that in mind with Windows\nnow the default is the last printer\n\n552\n00:28:34.540 --> 00:28:40.070\nyou used on that network, which might or\nmight not work out so well for you.\n\n553\n00:28:40.070 --> 00:28:43.670\nBut as long as you're aware of it,\nyou can make the adjustments.\n\n554\n00:28:43.670 --> 00:28:48.050\nYou can uncheck this because right\nnow if I look at this printer.\n\n555\n00:28:48.050 --> 00:28:50.910\nI can see open queue so\nI can get to the print queue.\n\n556\n00:28:50.910 --> 00:28:51.680\nI can remove it.\n\n557\n00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:52.550\nI can click Manage.\n\n558\n00:28:52.550 --> 00:28:55.430\nIf I click Manage,\nI can open the print queue,\n\n559\n00:28:55.430 --> 00:28:58.770\ndo some testing things, but\nI can't set it as my default.\n\n560\n00:28:58.770 --> 00:29:03.450\nBecause Windows is managing my default\nprinter based on the last printer I used\n\n561\n00:29:03.450 --> 00:29:05.110\non that particular network.\n\n562\n00:29:05.110 --> 00:29:09.280\nIf I uncheck this though,\nnow Windows is no longer responsible for\n\n563\n00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:14.200\nmanaging my printers, and I can come to\nthis printer and I can click Manage, and\n\n564\n00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:16.320\nI can click Set as default, right.\n\n565\n00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:23.760\nAnd so now I can go to any printer,\nmanage, and set it as default.\n\n566\n00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:27.990\nAnd the problem is it's not network aware.\n\n567\n00:29:27.990 --> 00:29:31.530\nSo that default printer will be my printer\nwhen I go home, when I get to work.\n\n568\n00:29:31.530 --> 00:29:36.330\nSo it's like they kinda killed my\none of my favorite features there.\n\n569\n00:29:36.330 --> 00:29:37.690\nBut that's what I, for\n\n570\n00:29:37.690 --> 00:29:44.160\nthe exam understand that you can\nchoose to let Windows manage it.\n\n571\n00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:45.821\nAnd if you do that Windows manage it,\n\n572\n00:29:45.821 --> 00:29:49.370\nit's based on the last printer you\nused on that particular network.\n\n573\n00:29:49.370 --> 00:29:52.282\nSo if you only use that one printer and\nthen work one at home,\n\n574\n00:29:52.282 --> 00:29:54.880\nit works out just like\nthe old system does.\n\n575\n00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:57.540\nBut if you use multiple printers,\nit's based on that last printer you used.\n\n576\n00:29:57.540 --> 00:29:58.800\nSo keep that in mind.\n\n577\n00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:03.200\nIf you wanna set your default, you can do\nit, but only if you uncheck that check\n\n578\n00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:08.000\nmark and then go back into the properties\nof that printer and you can set that to,\n\n579\n00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:13.300\nwell, not the XPS writer, but the actual\nprinter, I can set it to the default.\n\n580\n00:30:13.300 --> 00:30:16.440\nOops, I checked that again, didn't I?\n\n581\n00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:17.840\nYup.\nI uncheck that,\n\n582\n00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:21.690\nnow I can set that printer as the default.\n\n583\n00:30:21.690 --> 00:30:26.230\nSo that is how you manage your\nlocation where printing now\n\n584\n00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:27.620\nin Windows 10.\n&gt;&gt; Gosh,\n\n585\n00:30:27.620 --> 00:30:31.350\nwe've talked about a lot in this show,\nincluding printers and Mike shared his\n\n586\n00:30:31.350 --> 00:30:33.740\nexcitement with all of us about those.\n&gt;&gt;

client's perspective.\n\n15\n00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.080\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; That's what we're doing, but yeah.\n\n16\n00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.870\nAbsolutely.\n\n17\n00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.640\nI love talking about this stuff.\n\n18\n00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.020\nSo let's just dive right in.\n\n19\n00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.040\nWhen it comes to configuring\nnetwork security for\n\n20\n00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.230\nthis exam, they're gonna pick out a few\ntopics that we need to be familiar with.\n\n21\n00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.610\nOne of them's gonna be firewalls,\n\n22\n00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.990\nthe other one would be Security rules and\nIPSEC.\n\n23\n00:00:54.990 --> 00:01:00.250\nSo that's what we're gonna cover over\nthese next episode or two or three.\n\n24\n00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:02.680\nYou guys know how I am\nwhen I get to talking.\n\n25\n00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.000\nSo that is our plan.\n\n26\n00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.960\nAnd we're gonna start with\nthe good old Windows firewall.\n\n27\n00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.030\nAnd Cherokee, if I was gonna ask you,\nhow do you define a firewall?\n\n28\n00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:12.297\nWhat is a firewall?\n\n29\n00:01:12.297 --> 00:01:15.350\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's a good question.\n\n30\n00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.510\nSo this might not be the best way, but\n\n31\n00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:23.520\nwhen I first started learning about\nfirewalls, in my mind, I thought of it\n\n32\n00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.410\nas like a big giant black\nindustrial sized garbage bag.\n\n33\n00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:32.450\nAnd then it was kind of like if I was\nspraying a hose towards that bag it's like\n\n34\n00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:33.800\nkeeping things out.\n\n35\n00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.290\nBut if I poke little holes in the garbage\nbag on like an as needed basis,\n\n36\n00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.570\nit would let that light or water in.\n\n37\n00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.860\nThat's probably not at\nall a good analogy but\n\n38\n00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.720\nthat's how I thought about it when I\nfirst was trying to comprehend this idea.\n\n39\n00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.186\n&gt;&gt; I don't know if there's a bad analogy,\nright?\n\n40\n00:01:48.186 --> 00:01:49.980\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If it works for you,\n\n41\n00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:51.570\nthat's definitely a good one.\n\n42\n00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.610\nAnd your concepts are sound, right?\n\n43\n00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.020\nThat is the idea of a firewall.\n\n44\n00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.010\nWhen we think about network\ncommunications between computers, right,\n\n45\n00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:04.430\nthey establish a socket, a connection,\nand they send data back and forth.\n\n46\n00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.380\nAnd when we talk about a socket or\n\n47\n00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.100\na connection between two machines,\nthere's going to be three things involved.\n\n48\n00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.540\nThere's the protocol,\nthe IP address, and the port number.\n\n49\n00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.070\nAnd what we have to understand is that\nour computer is gonna have at least one\n\n50\n00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:20.580\nIP address,\nthat unique address associated with it.\n\n51\n00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.120\nAnd that's how we can receive data,\nbecause people know where to send data.\n\n52\n00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.320\nThey want to come to this machine.\n\n53\n00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:30.100\nSo we have that IP address that\nuniquely identified us on our network.\n\n54\n00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.850\nBut along with that IP address\nis those port numbers.\n\n55\n00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.000\nAnd what that really means is that.\n\n56\n00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.280\nOur computers can multitask.\n\n57\n00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.890\nThey can do more than one\nthing at the same time.\n\n58\n00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:40.800\nI might have my browser open.\n\n59\n00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.340\nI also might have my mail client open.\n\n60\n00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.790\nI might have a remote desktop session\ngoing on with another machine.\n\n61\n00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.770\nSo I've got a lot of traffic\ninbound to my computer.\n\n62\n00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:51.000\nAnd how does my computer know?\n\n63\n00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.290\nWell this packet that's coming in,\nthat's for the mail client?\n\n64\n00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.040\nOr is it going to your web browser?\n\n65\n00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.170\nOr is it going to that RDP client.\n\n66\n00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.070\nWhat is this traffic bound to?\n\n67\n00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.330\nCuz there's more than one\nthing going on the computer.\n\n68\n00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:04.270\nAnd that's where the port number comes in.\n\n69\n00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:09.030\nBy default, my RDP traffic's gonna be\ngoing same IP address for the destination.\n\n70\n00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.020\nBut it would be port 3389\nin the world of Microsoft.\n\n71\n00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:16.730\nDepending on our mail client we\nknow those port numbers and stuff.\n\n72\n00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:19.090\nI'm gonna try to 25 and 110, right?\n\n73\n00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:25.080\nIf I can remember those,\nbeen a little while.\n\n74\n00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.810\nBut those are those port numbers.\n\n75\n00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:33.490\nSo we can really think about there's\n65,536 ports, 0 through 535 so,\n\n76\n00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:35.170\n536 total ports.\n\n77\n00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:39.720\nAnd each one of those can be considered\na hole in that plastic bag, right?\n\n78\n00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.343\nOr a connection point to my machine,\nmm-hm.\n\n79\n00:03:42.343 --> 00:03:45.480\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Not that you asked, but\n\n80\n00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.375\nI have another crazy association, and\nI don't know if it would help anyone.\n\n81\n00:03:49.375 --> 00:03:51.845\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; But talking about the sockets.\n\n82\n00:03:51.845 --> 00:03:52.420\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n83\n00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:55.090\n&gt;&gt; The endpoints, that connection there.\n\n84\n00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:58.210\nI always thought of that as, I don't\nknow if you've ever played the game\n\n85\n00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:02.980\nof telephone where you take like a tin\ncan or cup and you tie a string on it.\n\n86\n00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:05.410\nAnd you can like talk into the can or\nwhatever.\n\n87\n00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:08.760\n&gt;&gt; So obviously, you'd have to\nhave a lot of strings and cans for\n\n88\n00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.380\nthose simultaneous connections for\nthose sockets there.\n\n89\n00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:14.730\nBut I don't know,\nI just always kind of thought of that.\n\n90\n00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:15.510\n&gt;&gt; I feel like.\n\n91\n00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:16.453\nI do remember playing that\nwhen I was a kid, absolutely.\n\n92\n00:04:16.453 --> 00:04:19.830\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so yeah,\n\n93\n00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:25.260\n65,5535, 36, possible connection points.\n\n94\n00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.460\nAnd so what a firewall does is says, look.\n\n95\n00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:31.130\nThat's a lot of open connection points\nthat anybody could, or somebody could try\n\n96\n00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:34.860\nto be making connections to this machine,\nso a firewall's gonna close them all down.\n\n97\n00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:40.030\nIt is a barrier, and usually see it drawn\nas a brick wall, or something like that.\n\n98\n00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:41.690\nAnd that's exactly what it is.\n\n99\n00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:45.400\nIt stops traffic from coming\nin as well as going out.\n\n100\n00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.710\nLet's not forget it we've got ingress and\negress inbound and\n\n101\n00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:51.865\noutbound traffic that we can\ncontrol with this firewall.\n\n102\n00:04:51.865 --> 00:04:55.680\nSo the firewall comes in and says look I'm\njust going to block it all boom, right.\n\n103\n00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:00.520\nThere are a bunch of defaults what\nhappens is when set firewall block soul\n\n104\n00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:04.820\n65535 of those Now we can start\nopening up the ones we want.\n\n105\n00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:07.830\nThis is where we start poking\nholes in that bag, all right?\n\n106\n00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:11.550\nI want to allow port 80 because\nmy machine is hosting a website.\n\n107\n00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:13.750\nAnd that's what people are going\nto come across to our.\n\n108\n00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:16.350\nI need to be able to remote it\ninto this machine when I get home.\n\n109\n00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:18.770\nSo I'm gonna poke a hole in\nthat firewall for port 3389.\n\n110\n00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:24.150\nThose are exceptions, that's what those\nare called when we deal with firewalls.\n\n111\n00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:28.290\nWe create exceptions or rules that say,\nall right, we know you're blocking\n\n112\n00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:32.270\neverything, but go ahead and\nallow this traffic to come through, right?\n\n113\n00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:34.850\nOr allow this traffic to\ngo out of the firewall,\n\n114\n00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:37.810\ncuz outbound traffic can\nbe controlled as well.\n\n115\n00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:39.290\nWe can also get more specific.\n\n116\n00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:41.530\nWe can say allow it to come through.\n\n117\n00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:43.190\nWe're going to poke a hole in there.\n\n118\n00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:45.410\nBut maybe instead of just being a hole,\n\n119\n00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:50.070\nyou can think of it like a piece of screen\nover that hole, so that not everything\n\n120\n00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:53.880\ncan come through there, only if it's\nsmall enough to fit through the screen.\n\n121\n00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:57.080\nWe can make rules that say yes,\nallow this traffic to come through.\n\n122\n00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.110\nI'm hosting a website but it's only for\n\n123\n00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:01.400\nother computers that are on\nmy local area network.\n\n124\n00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:06.560\nSo only if you're coming through this\nport, let's say port 80, it'll be allowed\n\n125\n00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:09.990\nonly if the source address is from\nthis particular subnet, right.\n\n126\n00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:12.430\nOr only if that That\npacket is authenticated.\n\n127\n00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:14.380\nIs it allowed through that exception?\n\n128\n00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:18.270\nOr only if it's encrypted and\nauthenticated, is it allowed through?\n\n129\n00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:19.820\nThat's really what our firewall does.\n\n130\n00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:23.670\nIt allows me to control that\ntraffic going in and out to my PC.\n\n131\n00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:26.580\nAnd we can control that\ntraffic by creating rules\n\n132\n00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:29.470\nthat decide what traffic is allowed or\nis not allowed.\n\n133\n00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:33.650\nAnd we can also put constraints on\nthat traffic, or filters to say yes,\n\n134\n00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:37.610\nit's allowed but then place\nconditions on that allow statement.\n\n135\n00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:40.580\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean it's really smart that\nyou're encouraging us to think about\n\n136\n00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:42.310\ninbound, that ingress, and\n\n137\n00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:46.510\nthat egress, that outbound traffic because\nit's easy for us to think about hey,\n\n138\n00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:49.990\nwe don't want to let people in like you\ndon't want to let intruders in your home.\n\n139\n00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:52.810\nBut here with computer networks,\nwe also have to think about well, hey,\n\n140\n00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:57.090\nis someone using my computer as part of\na distributed denial of service attack or\n\n141\n00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:01.500\nis someone trying to steal important\ncorporate data off of, you know,\n\n142\n00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:03.830\nsensitive information from my corporation?\n\n143\n00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:08.230\nSo it's all about the traffic in\ntheir bound and as well as outbound.\n\n144\n00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:09.100\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n145\n00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:11.260\nAnd we're talking about when\nmachine gets infected and\n\n146\n00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:14.110\nnow it's potentially spread\nto the rest of the machines.\n\n147\n00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:17.160\nThis firewall is gonna help control\nthat kind of thing, all right.\n\n148\n00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:19.780\nSo now that we got an idea of\nwhat a firewall is all about,\n\n149\n00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:22.520\nlet's talk about What we have in Windows.\n\n150\n00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:25.960\nAnd this started back in\nWindows XP Service Pack 3,\n\n151\n00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:30.570\nintroduced what was known\nthen as the Windows Firewall.\n\n152\n00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:33.060\nAnd I know you go back to that time.\n\n153\n00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:34.380\nDid you ever use any of the third party?\n\n154\n00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:36.780\n&gt;&gt; Well I was thinking, it wasn't\nService Pack 2 cuz I know there was-\n\n155\n00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:37.320\n&gt;&gt; It might have been.\n\n156\n00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:40.530\n&gt;&gt; A ton of security releases there, but-\n&gt;&gt; It might have been, yeah.\n\n157\n00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:42.460\n&gt;&gt; That was still a long time ago, so.\n\n158\n00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:47.390\nAnd I remember before that, we had to\nuse third parties, like I don't know,\n\n159\n00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:49.430\nI'm trying to think of one I used\nway back when, ZoneAlarm Pro,\n\n160\n00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:52.710\nI don't know if you remember-\n&gt;&gt; I really started with XP.\n\n161\n00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:53.250\n&gt;&gt; With XP?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n162\n00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:54.683\n&gt;&gt; So\nyou had that firewall built in there.\n\n163\n00:07:54.683 --> 00:07:55.543\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, and so\n\n164\n00:07:55.543 --> 00:07:59.541\nWindows started to include\na firewall in the operating system.\n\n165\n00:07:59.541 --> 00:08:03.917\nProbably one thing I will point out right\nnow just to make sure we're aware of this,\n\n166\n00:08:03.917 --> 00:08:07.121\nDon't try to run more than one\nfirewall on the same machine.\n\n167\n00:08:07.121 --> 00:08:10.988\nIt's really not gonna give\nyou any extra protection and\n\n168\n00:08:10.988 --> 00:08:14.698\nit's gonna cause a lot of\nadministrative overhead.\n\n169\n00:08:14.698 --> 00:08:17.609\nBecause think about our\nconcept of a brick wall and\n\n170\n00:08:17.609 --> 00:08:21.153\nthen punching holes through it\nto allow something in or out.\n\n171\n00:08:21.153 --> 00:08:24.927\nIf I have two walls, well now I just have\nto punch the hole through both of them.\n\n172\n00:08:24.927 --> 00:08:28.233\nAnd then, that means, going in and\nmaking a rule on each one of them,\n\n173\n00:08:28.233 --> 00:08:31.669\nif I do one and not the other,\none allows it, but the other one stops it.\n\n174\n00:08:31.669 --> 00:08:33.454\nThey can start fighting with each other,\n\n175\n00:08:33.454 --> 00:08:35.605\nit's really not giving\nyou any more protection.\n\n176\n00:08:35.605 --> 00:08:37.597\nSo, pick the one you want to use,\nand again,\n\n177\n00:08:37.597 --> 00:08:39.598\nwe're gonna be using the Windows Firewall.\n\n178\n00:08:39.598 --> 00:08:42.808\nThat's what we need to know about for\nthe exam.\n\n179\n00:08:42.808 --> 00:08:45.024\nI keep saying Windows Firewall, but\n\n180\n00:08:45.024 --> 00:08:49.898\nI will tell you that recently they have\nchanged the name of the Windows Firewall.\n\n181\n00:08:49.898 --> 00:08:52.363\nIt is now the Windows Defender Firewall.\n\n182\n00:08:52.363 --> 00:08:57.361\nWe've seen Windows Defender come and\ngo, and change names and come back.\n\n183\n00:08:57.361 --> 00:09:02.034\nBut it is now becoming kinda like\nthe Security Center in Windows 10.\n\n184\n00:09:02.034 --> 00:09:04.851\nAnd so now it's called\nthe Windows Defender Firewall.\n\n185\n00:09:04.851 --> 00:09:08.622\nSo if you see that written on an exam,\nor anything you are reading.\n\n186\n00:09:08.622 --> 00:09:10.545\nUnderstand, it's the same Firewall,\n\n187\n00:09:10.545 --> 00:09:13.098\nit's just now under\nthe Windows Defender umbrella.\n\n188\n00:09:13.098 --> 00:09:16.218\n&gt;&gt; I think I just figured out\nmy new Halloween costume.\n\n189\n00:09:16.218 --> 00:09:17.389\n&gt;&gt; You're gonna be a Firewall?\n\n190\n00:09:17.389 --> 00:09:19.509\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the Windows Defender,\nwhoo-hoo, tad-ya.\n\n191\n00:09:19.509 --> 00:09:20.009\n&gt;&gt; I like it.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n192\n00:09:20.009 --> 00:09:21.826\n&gt;&gt; Gets you a little shield and\n\n193\n00:09:21.826 --> 00:09:25.701\nyou're good to go, all right.\nSo, let's take a look at what we've got\n\n194\n00:09:25.701 --> 00:09:29.045\nin Windows.\nSo, if you take a look at my screen here,\n\n195\n00:09:29.045 --> 00:09:34.134\nI'm simply gonna go to my Settings.\nI'm gonna type in fire and see if I\n\n196\n00:09:34.134 --> 00:09:38.812\ncan find Windows Defender Firewall there.\nAnd we'll launch that, and\n\n197\n00:09:38.812 --> 00:09:41.862\nthen I'm gonna close this just\nbecause it annoys me to have a window\n\n198\n00:09:41.862 --> 00:09:45.920\nbehind a window there, that's crazy.\nAll right, so this is the basic\n\n199\n00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:50.686\nWindows Defender Firewall console.\nAnd I can do some things through here,\n\n200\n00:09:50.686 --> 00:09:55.023\nnot everything through this console.\nThat's why they call it the basic console,\n\n201\n00:09:55.023 --> 00:09:56.983\nright?\nThe first thing we can tell is whether or\n\n202\n00:09:56.983 --> 00:10:00.580\nnot they're on.\nI can see I have a little green check mark\n\n203\n00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:04.487\nhere next to my Domain networks.\nAnd before we go any further,\n\n204\n00:10:04.487 --> 00:10:08.344\nlet's talk about these.\nThis is something that they've added,\n\n205\n00:10:08.344 --> 00:10:13.362\nnot recently, but it is a change of your\ncoming from way back when if you're new\n\n206\n00:10:13.362 --> 00:10:18.142\nto this, understanding this for the exam.\nMy Firewall Settings are on\n\n207\n00:10:18.142 --> 00:10:21.320\na per-network profile basis.\nIn other words,\n\n208\n00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:25.504\nwe've got three network profiles,\nwe can apply to any Network we connect to.\n\n209\n00:10:25.504 --> 00:10:27.320\nWe've talked about this in other episodes.\n\n210\n00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:28.724\nPublic and private,\n\n211\n00:10:28.724 --> 00:10:31.670\nright?\nPublic for your less secure places, more\n\n212\n00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:34.784\nrestrict, more strict Firewall Settings.\nPrivate,\n\n213\n00:10:34.784 --> 00:10:38.396\nwe're gonna relax those a little bit and\nallow more things to come through,\n\n214\n00:10:38.396 --> 00:10:41.969\nbecause we're on a trusted network.\nHopefully we do trust that network.\n\n215\n00:10:41.969 --> 00:10:42.540\nAnd then,\n\n216\n00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:46.351\ndomain gets applied automatically if\nit detects a domain controller on\n\n217\n00:10:46.351 --> 00:10:49.727\nthe network.\nWhich is also a little more relaxed than\n\n218\n00:10:49.727 --> 00:10:54.532\nin public, so that we can do our job.\nBut again it should be a trusted network.\n\n219\n00:10:54.532 --> 00:10:57.240\nSo, that's why you see three different\n\n220\n00:10:57.240 --> 00:11:00.543\nsections here.\nYou could see this one is connected.\n\n221\n00:11:00.543 --> 00:11:02.396\nI am not connected to a private or\n\n222\n00:11:02.396 --> 00:11:05.565\na public network, so\nthey say not connected, right?\n\n223\n00:11:05.565 --> 00:11:08.135\nAnd let's just start with this one right\n\n224\n00:11:08.135 --> 00:11:13.502\nhere, over here to the left, you're gonna\nsee turn Windows Defender Firewall on or\n\n225\n00:11:13.502 --> 00:11:15.336\noff.\nSo I'm gonna click on that,\n\n226\n00:11:15.336 --> 00:11:18.338\nI'll take a look at some of\nthese Settings that I have here.\n\n227\n00:11:18.338 --> 00:11:19.028\nAnd again,\n\n228\n00:11:19.028 --> 00:11:23.238\nyou can see it's based on the three\nprofiles, so I can turn it on or off for\n\n229\n00:11:23.238 --> 00:11:27.466\neach one of those individually.\nMaybe I don't want it on at all when I'm\n\n230\n00:11:27.466 --> 00:11:30.455\non a private network.\nIt would probably not be wise, but\n\n231\n00:11:30.455 --> 00:11:34.622\nyou might have a good reason to do that.\nSo this is where you could turn them on or\n\n232\n00:11:34.622 --> 00:11:36.520\noff.\nYou can also control whether or\n\n233\n00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:39.740\nnot you get notifications.\nWhen Windows Defender blocks something\n\n234\n00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:40.369\nand says hey,\n\n235\n00:11:40.369 --> 00:11:44.135\nyou're not allowed to come through.\nAnd you get that little pop-up down in\n\n236\n00:11:44.135 --> 00:11:47.710\nyour system tray saying,\nWindows Defender Firewall has blocked\n\n237\n00:11:47.710 --> 00:11:50.260\nsuch and such.\nAnd typically, give you the chance to\n\n238\n00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:52.298\nmaybe go allow it or something like that.\nAnd\n\n239\n00:11:52.298 --> 00:11:54.697\neach one of those has those check marks.\nAnd then,\n\n240\n00:11:54.697 --> 00:11:58.402\nthere's also a block all incoming\nconnections, including those in the list\n\n241\n00:11:58.402 --> 00:12:01.418\nof allowed apps.\nAnd you can see that on each one of these\n\n242\n00:12:01.418 --> 00:12:04.335\nas well.\nI'll check it there just to highlight\n\n243\n00:12:04.335 --> 00:12:06.947\nthe one I'm doing.\nThis is a handy if,\n\n244\n00:12:06.947 --> 00:12:11.333\nmaybe I'm troubleshooting or\nI suspect something is wrong or\n\n245\n00:12:11.333 --> 00:12:15.339\na virus is loose or something like that.\nI don't wanna have to\n\n246\n00:12:15.339 --> 00:12:17.873\ngo undo all of my exceptions.\nI've taken time\n\n247\n00:12:17.873 --> 00:12:22.302\nto allow certain things to come through\nthe Firewall that I need to do my job.\n\n248\n00:12:22.302 --> 00:12:23.886\nBut now, I've got a problem, or\n\n249\n00:12:23.886 --> 00:12:26.982\nI need to troubleshoot.\nI can quickly come in here and just say,\n\n250\n00:12:26.982 --> 00:12:29.873\nhey, block everything,\neven if I get an exception for it.\n\n251\n00:12:29.873 --> 00:12:31.703\nAnd then, when I get done testing or\n\n252\n00:12:31.703 --> 00:12:35.851\nall things return to normal, I can come in\nhere and just turn all those exceptions\n\n253\n00:12:35.851 --> 00:12:37.997\nback on or allow things through again.\nSo\n\n254\n00:12:37.997 --> 00:12:40.603\nit's really handy to\nhave that ability to say,\n\n255\n00:12:40.603 --> 00:12:43.089\nyou know what, block all my exceptions.\nAnd\n\n256\n00:12:43.089 --> 00:12:45.960\nwe don't have to go into\ndisable more exceptions and\n\n257\n00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:48.229\nremember to enable them when I am done.\nSo\n\n258\n00:12:48.229 --> 00:12:51.241\nI like that feature there as well.\n&gt;&gt; So, it seems like here in\n\n259\n00:12:51.241 --> 00:12:55.573\nour Windows Defender, it's like taking\nour individual firewall rules and\n\n260\n00:12:55.573 --> 00:13:00.096\nMicrosoft says, hey, I've got some ideas.\nLet me group them together and maybe this\n\n261\n00:13:00.096 --> 00:13:01.946\nwill be a little bit easier for you.\nBut\n\n262\n00:13:01.946 --> 00:13:06.125\nyou still have that option to go in and\nreally choose them individually if you\n\n263\n00:13:06.125 --> 00:13:09.124\nwant to.\n&gt;&gt; Yep, exactly, and that's exactly what\n\n264\n00:13:09.124 --> 00:13:12.222\nthis is, the basic firewall just gives me.\nNot so\n\n265\n00:13:12.222 --> 00:13:15.353\ngranular control over my firewall.\nSo\n\n266\n00:13:15.353 --> 00:13:18.776\nback out here to the main screen.\nSo, we can see that I can turn each\n\n267\n00:13:18.776 --> 00:13:22.326\none of those on or off.\nI can click Change Notification Settings.\n\n268\n00:13:22.326 --> 00:13:24.678\nIt takes me right back to the same Window,\n\n269\n00:13:24.678 --> 00:13:27.840\nbecause that's where that\nNotification Setting was,\n\n270\n00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:30.782\nright?\nYou can also Restore defaults over here if\n\n271\n00:13:30.782 --> 00:13:33.952\nyou goof things up while playing around or\nlearning.\n\n272\n00:13:33.952 --> 00:13:36.415\nDon't be scared to try things out, but\n\n273\n00:13:36.415 --> 00:13:41.120\nwhen you're done you can click Restore\nFefaults to get back to at least what\n\n274\n00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:45.158\nMicrosoft thinks it should be set to.\nWe also have Change Notifica,\n\n275\n00:13:45.158 --> 00:13:46.913\nI did that one already, didn't I?\n\n276\n00:13:46.913 --> 00:13:50.624\nWe have allow an app or\nfeature through Windows Firewall.\n\n277\n00:13:50.624 --> 00:13:55.279\nSo I said that we've got some default\nrules in place that are gonna allow my PC\n\n278\n00:13:55.279 --> 00:13:56.893\nto function on a network.\n\n279\n00:13:56.893 --> 00:14:01.382\nIt doesn't actually go in and\nblock all 65,535 ports.\n\n280\n00:14:01.382 --> 00:14:05.172\nSome are left open to allow\nnormal communications.\n\n281\n00:14:05.172 --> 00:14:08.389\nBut if I wanna allow something\nthrough the firewall, right?\n\n282\n00:14:08.389 --> 00:14:12.681\nI can click right here and\nit's gonna bring me to a little list\n\n283\n00:14:12.681 --> 00:14:17.322\nwhere I can choose to allow\nan application through the firewall.\n\n284\n00:14:17.322 --> 00:14:20.654\nThat's good, because that's what the link\nsaid it was gonna allow me to do.\n\n285\n00:14:20.654 --> 00:14:24.286\nAnd you can see this little list here,\nand it's not actually little.\n\n286\n00:14:24.286 --> 00:14:28.462\nBut each one of these is just\nan Application, like Eclipse Manager or\n\n287\n00:14:28.462 --> 00:14:30.337\nDuolingo, right, is an app.\n\n288\n00:14:30.337 --> 00:14:33.949\nAnd I can see there's a check mark for\neach one, domain, public, and private.\n\n289\n00:14:33.949 --> 00:14:34.783\nSo that means,\n\n290\n00:14:34.783 --> 00:14:38.905\nthis application is gonna be allowed\nto send traffic through the firewall.\n\n291\n00:14:38.905 --> 00:14:40.938\nThe firewall is not gonna block it.\n\n292\n00:14:40.938 --> 00:14:43.199\nSo if I wanna turn one of these on, like,\n\n293\n00:14:43.199 --> 00:14:45.804\nlet's find one that I\nmight actually turn on.\n\n294\n00:14:45.804 --> 00:14:46.925\nRemote Desktop, right?\n\n295\n00:14:46.925 --> 00:14:50.471\nIf I wanna turn that on,\nI can put a check mark there.\n\n296\n00:14:50.471 --> 00:14:54.071\nThat's gonna allow port 3389 in this case.\n\n297\n00:14:54.071 --> 00:14:58.358\nAnd then, I can say, well I wanna do it\non domain and private but not public.\n\n298\n00:14:58.358 --> 00:15:02.082\nSo if I connect to a public network,\nlike at that coffee shop or the airport.\n\n299\n00:15:02.082 --> 00:15:02.802\n&gt;&gt; Not a good idea.\n\n300\n00:15:02.802 --> 00:15:05.957\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, nobody's gonna be able to try\nto remote desktop into this machine,\n\n301\n00:15:05.957 --> 00:15:06.920\nwhich is a good thing.\n\n302\n00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:09.931\n&gt;&gt; Let me rephrase that,\nit is a good idea to not have it checked.\n\n303\n00:15:09.931 --> 00:15:11.741\n&gt;&gt; Yes [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; It's not a good idea to have it\n\n304\n00:15:11.741 --> 00:15:13.067\nturned on those public.\n\n305\n00:15:13.067 --> 00:15:13.767\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n306\n00:15:13.767 --> 00:15:14.487\n&gt;&gt; Environment.\n\n307\n00:15:14.487 --> 00:15:16.932\n&gt;&gt; But at home or at work,\nI'm okay with people,\n\n308\n00:15:16.932 --> 00:15:19.708\nmy help desk uses remote\ndesktop to fix my computer.\n\n309\n00:15:19.708 --> 00:15:24.245\nSo I wanna make sure there's an exception\nfor that, to allow that in, right?\n\n310\n00:15:24.245 --> 00:15:26.744\nThis is the list that they provide.\n\n311\n00:15:26.744 --> 00:15:29.872\nIt's mostly the apps that\nyou have installed, but\n\n312\n00:15:29.872 --> 00:15:32.209\nyou can also click Allow Another App.\n\n313\n00:15:32.209 --> 00:15:34.379\nAnd you can go find that Application.\n\n314\n00:15:34.379 --> 00:15:37.409\nI can browse,\nyou'll see it takes me out to my System32.\n\n315\n00:15:37.409 --> 00:15:42.393\nAnd I can find the executable or\nwhatever it is, for that application.\n\n316\n00:15:42.393 --> 00:15:45.460\nAdd it to the list, and\nthen choose an Office anything in here.\n\n317\n00:15:45.460 --> 00:15:51.620\nLet's find a Notepad, assuming you just\nlike I said wanna browse in through here.\n\n318\n00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:55.432\nI'm gonna find Notepad doesn't make a lot\nof sense, but I'm gonna select it anyway.\n\n319\n00:15:55.432 --> 00:15:58.240\nSo you can see,\nit puts the executable in there.\n\n320\n00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:02.625\nSo now, I've got Notepad,\nthen I would click Add.\n\n321\n00:16:02.625 --> 00:16:06.437\nAnd now over here Notepad is in my list.\n\n322\n00:16:06.437 --> 00:16:10.950\nAnd I can choose to block or allow it.\n\n323\n00:16:10.950 --> 00:16:13.860\nOn some of these things, me personally,\n\n324\n00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:17.330\nwhat I find is that I'm not adding it\nto allow it, I'm adding it to block it.\n\n325\n00:16:17.330 --> 00:16:21.270\nA lot of these apps need Internet\naccess that I don't think\n\n326\n00:16:21.270 --> 00:16:22.700\nreally need Internet access.\n\n327\n00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:26.480\nSo I can come in here, add the app,\nand then just uncheck all of these and\n\n328\n00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:29.693\nthat firewall will keep it from\ngoing out and calling home and\n\n329\n00:16:29.693 --> 00:16:32.863\ngiving me the latest advertisements and\nthings like that.\n\n330\n00:16:32.863 --> 00:16:36.157\n&gt;&gt; Well that's true, or if you have\nan application that you want to work and\n\n331\n00:16:36.157 --> 00:16:39.721\nyou don't know exactly all the ports\nthat are associated with that particular\n\n332\n00:16:39.721 --> 00:16:42.910\napplication, you can just\nkind of take that short cut.\n\n333\n00:16:42.910 --> 00:16:44.920\nYou don't have to know all\nthose individual ports,\n\n334\n00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:48.630\nbut it is less secure from\nthat stand point not knowing.\n\n335\n00:16:48.630 --> 00:16:51.080\nBut-\n&gt;&gt; It is, and we'll talk about that.\n\n336\n00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:52.930\nI'll go both ways on that one.\n\n337\n00:16:52.930 --> 00:16:54.960\nYou can also click details\nwith one of these and\n\n338\n00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:57.130\nyou can see the actual excutable.\n\n339\n00:16:57.130 --> 00:17:00.590\nSo if you weren't sure, hey,\nwhat is this MSN Weather?\n\n340\n00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:03.500\nActually they won't give you\ndetails on MSN Weather, wow,\n\n341\n00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:05.460\nthey hide all the Microsoft\nstuff from you.\n\n342\n00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:06.220\nIsn't that interesting?\n\n343\n00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:08.240\nSo there you go.\n\n344\n00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:10.920\nThat is how you can allow or\n\n345\n00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:16.210\nblock a particular application using\nthe basic interface with Windows Firewall.\n\n346\n00:17:16.210 --> 00:17:18.440\nPretty straightforward, pretty simple.\n\n347\n00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:20.890\nAnd that's what it was meant to be,\nright, this is not\n\n348\n00:17:20.890 --> 00:17:24.830\nthe granular control I would want to use\nin an enterprise environment most likely.\n\n349\n00:17:24.830 --> 00:17:29.180\nBut for home PC's,\nsmall work groups in an office,\n\n350\n00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:33.985\na dentist office or something where\nthere's only a few PCs, this might be\n\n351\n00:17:33.985 --> 00:17:38.155\nhow you choose to deal with\nconfiguring your Windows firewalls.\n\n352\n00:17:38.155 --> 00:17:40.675\n[COUGH] Excuse me, all right, but\n\n353\n00:17:40.675 --> 00:17:45.245\nnow let's take a step into\nthe advanced settings.\n\n354\n00:17:45.245 --> 00:17:48.705\nAnd you can see right over here,\nthere's a link for Advanced settings.\n\n355\n00:17:48.705 --> 00:17:51.050\nIf I click on that,\n\n356\n00:17:51.050 --> 00:17:56.294\nthat opens up the Windows Defender\nfirewall with advanced security.\n\n357\n00:17:56.294 --> 00:17:58.405\n[NOISE]\n&gt;&gt; [NOISE] [LAUGH]\n\n358\n00:17:58.405 --> 00:17:59.120\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right, and\n\n359\n00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:00.842\nthat wasn't rehearsed.\n\n360\n00:18:00.842 --> 00:18:05.100\nAnd so this is the more granular\ncontrol that we can get.\n\n361\n00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:09.470\nSo I'm gonna close the standard\nfirewall console, and\n\n362\n00:18:09.470 --> 00:18:11.370\nwe'll take a look at this\none with advanced security.\n\n363\n00:18:11.370 --> 00:18:14.350\nSo what makes this thing so\nmuch more advanced?\n\n364\n00:18:14.350 --> 00:18:16.490\nWell, many things actually.\n\n365\n00:18:16.490 --> 00:18:20.790\nThe first thing you're gonna see is that\ninstead of just saying what applications\n\n366\n00:18:20.790 --> 00:18:26.200\nare allowed, I have inbound rules and\nI have outbound rules.\n\n367\n00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:31.080\nAnd you can see that there are several\nrules in here already created,\n\n368\n00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:35.200\nmany of which are already enabled as well.\n\n369\n00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:36.630\nSo I've got inbound.\n\n370\n00:18:36.630 --> 00:18:38.730\nInbound is gonna be traffic destined for\n\n371\n00:18:38.730 --> 00:18:42.500\nmy machine,\ncoming from somewhere else towards me.\n\n372\n00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:47.850\nOutbound will be traffic leaving\nmy computer, going somewhere else.\n\n373\n00:18:47.850 --> 00:18:50.640\nSo I've got inbound rules,\nI've got outbound rules, and\n\n374\n00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:52.940\nI also have connection security rules.\n\n375\n00:18:52.940 --> 00:18:58.340\nAnd connection security rules\nare rules that we can use to\n\n376\n00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:03.210\ndecide whether or not the traffic\nhas to be authenticated, and\n\n377\n00:19:03.210 --> 00:19:06.920\nwe can actually provide some\nintegrity in there as well.\n\n378\n00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:12.720\nIn other words, when a machine\ntries to connect to my machine,\n\n379\n00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:15.250\ndo I have to prove who that is first?\n\n380\n00:19:15.250 --> 00:19:17.560\nI want to know who that is\nbefore I allow that connection.\n\n381\n00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:20.930\nThat's what connection security\nrules are all about, is\n\n382\n00:19:20.930 --> 00:19:25.710\nidentifying each end of the conversation\nbefore that connection is allowed, right.\n\n383\n00:19:25.710 --> 00:19:29.850\nAnd we'll talk much more about\nthat as we go through here.\n\n384\n00:19:29.850 --> 00:19:34.618\nThere's also a monitoring node,\nand underneath monitoring I've got\n\n385\n00:19:34.618 --> 00:19:39.079\nfirewall where I can see all of\nmy currently active rules, right.\n\n386\n00:19:39.079 --> 00:19:42.900\nI can see all those listed here,\nthey're all turned on.\n\n387\n00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:45.700\nNothing really to see just\na list of rules there.\n\n388\n00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:50.280\nI can also see if there's any currently\nactive connection security rules,\n\n389\n00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:51.780\nwhich I don't have any.\n\n390\n00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:54.443\nAnd I also have security associations.\n\n391\n00:19:54.443 --> 00:19:58.122\nAnd underneath there we have main mode and\nwe have quick mode.\n\n392\n00:19:58.122 --> 00:20:04.210\nAnd we'll talk a little more about that I\nthink when we get into IPsec, all right,\n\n393\n00:20:04.210 --> 00:20:08.540\nso we will come back around when we get\nconnection security rule and IPsec.\n\n394\n00:20:08.540 --> 00:20:11.890\nWe'll talk a little bit more about that,\nbut let's go back up here to these rules.\n\n395\n00:20:11.890 --> 00:20:15.340\nSo what's different between\nthat standard console and this?\n\n396\n00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:19.590\nAgain, more granular,\nwe're seeing inbound versus outbound.\n\n397\n00:20:19.590 --> 00:20:23.070\nAnd rather than adding an app,\nwe have this new rule.\n\n398\n00:20:23.070 --> 00:20:25.570\nYou have to choose,\ndo you wanna do inbound or outbound?\n\n399\n00:20:25.570 --> 00:20:30.878\nAlthough it doesn't really matter I\nguess cuz you can always change that.\n\n400\n00:20:30.878 --> 00:20:34.860\nBut I shouldn't say that,\nmake sure you click on the right one,\n\n401\n00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:38.460\nit used to ask you is it inbound or\noutbound, but anyway.\n\n402\n00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:41.100\nSo the first screen of\nmy wizard here says,\n\n403\n00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:44.440\nwhat type of rule would\nyou like to create?\n\n404\n00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:48.200\nAnd I've got program, port,\npredefined, or custom.\n\n405\n00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:52.140\nProgram is just like that general\nfirewall, Windows Defender firewall,\n\n406\n00:20:52.140 --> 00:20:52.990\nthat we just looked at.\n\n407\n00:20:52.990 --> 00:20:55.895\nI could add Notepad or Internet Hearts or\n\n408\n00:20:55.895 --> 00:21:00.045\nMahjong or whatever it was that we\nneeded to allow through the firewall.\n\n409\n00:21:00.045 --> 00:21:04.536\n&gt;&gt; It seems like that it's a little bit of\nan old school term because we used to call\n\n410\n00:21:04.536 --> 00:21:08.363\nthem programs, even like\nthe Microsoft applications like Word.\n\n411\n00:21:08.363 --> 00:21:10.765\nAnd so\nnowadays you always hear applications.\n\n412\n00:21:10.765 --> 00:21:12.380\nSo-\n&gt;&gt; I don't know.\n\n413\n00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:17.150\nThey'll probably update this soon enough,\nright, and call it an application.\n\n414\n00:21:17.150 --> 00:21:20.390\nBut for now, yep,\nthey're gonna call it a program.\n\n415\n00:21:20.390 --> 00:21:26.560\nPort, so program would be something like\nNotepad or Mahjong or Remote Desktop or\n\n416\n00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:29.930\nsomething like that, where you're pointing\nout the executable for that application\n\n417\n00:21:29.930 --> 00:21:34.010\nand saying this program has the ability\nto go in and out of the firewall.\n\n418\n00:21:34.010 --> 00:21:35.530\nYou also have port rules.\n\n419\n00:21:35.530 --> 00:21:39.520\nHere we`re gonna define what\nport number and what protocol.\n\n420\n00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:47.280\nTCP port 80 or UDP port 5,432 or\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n421\n00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:51.230\nAnd then you have predefined, and I love\nthese predefined, use them quite often.\n\n422\n00:21:51.230 --> 00:21:53.340\nIf I get my list to actually work,\n\n423\n00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:57.380\nyou can see a lot of predefined rules\nin here that Microsoft provides us.\n\n424\n00:21:57.380 --> 00:22:01.230\nI always find these extremely\nhandy when I'm working with branch\n\n425\n00:22:01.230 --> 00:22:06.160\ncache cuz they've got those prebuilt rules\nright there that I can just turn on.\n\n426\n00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:06.718\nMakes it easy for administration.\n\n427\n00:22:06.718 --> 00:22:12.382\n&gt;&gt; Especially whenever you have multiple,\nwhat's the word I'm looking for?\n\n428\n00:22:12.382 --> 00:22:14.950\nWhen you have a lot and\nthey come in groups.\n\n429\n00:22:14.950 --> 00:22:19.140\nSo the rule will go ahead and\nenable or disable, allow or block,\n\n430\n00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:23.670\nfor numerous individual rules so you\ndon't have to do it five different times.\n\n431\n00:22:23.670 --> 00:22:25.520\nYou just do it once, and\nthen you're finished.\n\n432\n00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:28.520\n&gt;&gt; Exactly,\nit makes life a whole lot easier.\n\n433\n00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:33.020\nAnd then I also have custom, and\nif you watch this list right over here,\n\n434\n00:22:33.020 --> 00:22:37.228\nright, Program, Protocol,\nScope, Action, Profile, Name.\n\n435\n00:22:37.228 --> 00:22:41.001\nIf you're on Program those\nProtocols goes away.\n\n436\n00:22:41.001 --> 00:22:45.480\nIf I'm on port Program goes away and\nchanges the Protocols and Ports.\n\n437\n00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:49.809\nIf I'm on predefined, this mouse is\nskipping on me, we got Predefined.\n\n438\n00:22:49.809 --> 00:22:53.364\nWell there's not a lot to choose because\nyou're just gonna be picking one\n\n439\n00:22:53.364 --> 00:22:54.577\nthat's already built.\n\n440\n00:22:54.577 --> 00:22:57.632\nBut then when you go to Custom,\nbasically Custom says, all right,\n\n441\n00:22:57.632 --> 00:22:59.940\nI'll go through every page of the Wizard.\n\n442\n00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:03.840\nWhether it's protocols, programs,\nwhatever, and you can pick and\n\n443\n00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:04.900\nchoose what you need to do.\n\n444\n00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:06.210\nSo that's what Custom is.\n\n445\n00:23:06.210 --> 00:23:09.940\nJust show me all my options, and\nI'll let you know what I want to do.\n\n446\n00:23:09.940 --> 00:23:15.010\nAll right, now Cherokee,\nyou started talking about a program and\n\n447\n00:23:15.010 --> 00:23:18.350\nsaying that it might not be,\nI forget what you were saying.\n\n448\n00:23:18.350 --> 00:23:20.200\nWe were talking programs and ports.\n\n449\n00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:24.040\nAnd I want to go back and\ndifferentiate between those two.\n\n450\n00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:28.950\nBecause let's say I've got\na program that runs off port 4,000,\n\n451\n00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:30.730\nwe'll just use some random port number,\nright.\n\n452\n00:23:30.730 --> 00:23:32.730\nSay that program runs on port 4,000.\n\n453\n00:23:32.730 --> 00:23:36.030\nSo what do you think, should l come\nin here if l know the program and\n\n454\n00:23:36.030 --> 00:23:38.270\nl know the plot number,\nshould l come in here and\n\n455\n00:23:38.270 --> 00:23:43.400\ncreate a program rule, or should l create\na put rule or is there a difference?\n\n456\n00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:46.954\n&gt;&gt; I think there is a difference because\nsome times you have ephemeral ports and\n\n457\n00:23:46.954 --> 00:23:50.618\nthose are going to be, you have your\nephemeral and your non-ephermeral, and\n\n458\n00:23:50.618 --> 00:23:52.081\nI hope I'm saying this right.\n\n459\n00:23:52.081 --> 00:23:54.401\n&gt;&gt; You're gonna have to define that,\nwhat the heck does that mean, ephemeral?\n\n460\n00:23:54.401 --> 00:23:56.044\n&gt;&gt; Dynamic of non-dynamic, right.\n\n461\n00:23:56.044 --> 00:24:01.116\nSo if it's changing, if it's up there\nin the higher range and sometimes\n\n462\n00:24:01.116 --> 00:24:06.941\napplications will use They have different\nports that they have available to them,\n\n463\n00:24:06.941 --> 00:24:12.180\nthat they like preferences, but\nthey use based upon availability.\n\n464\n00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:14.740\nSo they may change in different times.\n\n465\n00:24:14.740 --> 00:24:18.460\n&gt;&gt; Exactly right and a great answer,\nand that's what it is.\n\n466\n00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:22.910\nWhen you say program,\nyou're not defining any specific port.\n\n467\n00:24:22.910 --> 00:24:26.700\nSo it doesn't matter what port that\nprogram uses, it's going to be allowed\n\n468\n00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:31.130\nbecause its name, its executable is\nin the list of allowed programs.\n\n469\n00:24:31.130 --> 00:24:34.540\nI do port number, then it doesn't\nmatter what the program is.\n\n470\n00:24:38.590 --> 00:24:41.542\nWhat's a better example here?\n\n471\n00:24:41.542 --> 00:24:47.420\nLet's say I wanna host a website, right,\non my computer here for my coworkers.\n\n472\n00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:48.270\nAnd so I'm gonna open up port 80.\n\n473\n00:24:48.270 --> 00:24:50.376\nAnd I could go in there and\nchoose the program,\n\n474\n00:24:50.376 --> 00:24:54.050\nI don't know what program that would\nbe associated with, the IIS, I guess.\n\n475\n00:24:54.050 --> 00:24:55.736\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So I can allow IIS, or\n\n476\n00:24:55.736 --> 00:24:57.393\nI can allow port 80.\n\n477\n00:24:57.393 --> 00:24:59.780\nEither one would actually work.\n\n478\n00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:04.690\nThe difference, though, is, as Cherokee\npointed out, if it's port number,\n\n479\n00:25:04.690 --> 00:25:07.800\nyes, web traffic IIS would be\nallowed to come through port 80.\n\n480\n00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:10.709\nBut so would anything else, right,\nanything that wants to use port 80.\n\n481\n00:25:10.709 --> 00:25:12.466\nCuz you're just opening up port 80.\n\n482\n00:25:12.466 --> 00:25:14.590\nYou're just saying,\nthis port is open, all right?\n\n483\n00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:17.980\nWhereas if I do program,\n\n484\n00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:20.620\nonly that particular program\ncan come through port 80.\n\n485\n00:25:20.620 --> 00:25:22.580\nAnything else tries to\ncome through port 80,\n\n486\n00:25:22.580 --> 00:25:25.040\nthen it's not gonna be allowed, all right?\n\n487\n00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:28.560\nSo that's one of the big differences\nthere is you either open up the port\n\n488\n00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:33.350\nholistically or completely for everything\nor opening up the port, but only for\n\n489\n00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:34.440\nthis program.\n\n490\n00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:40.304\nAnd then to Cherokee's point as well,\nsome programs do need other ports.\n\n491\n00:25:40.304 --> 00:25:47.080\nA bad example, but an example nonetheless,\nyears ago playing World of Warcraft.\n\n492\n00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:48.597\n&gt;&gt; Video games are notorious for this.\n\n493\n00:25:48.597 --> 00:25:50.830\n&gt;&gt; And you wanted to update your game.\n\n494\n00:25:50.830 --> 00:25:52.198\nAnd it was slow going.\n\n495\n00:25:52.198 --> 00:25:54.327\nAnd you started looking\nat the documentation.\n\n496\n00:25:54.327 --> 00:25:58.210\nAnd it showed you that, hey,\nwe're using this port number for\n\n497\n00:25:58.210 --> 00:26:00.420\nthe download of that update.\n\n498\n00:26:00.420 --> 00:26:03.547\nBut if you open up these ports and\nthey were up in the 50000 range,\n\n499\n00:26:03.547 --> 00:26:05.351\nyou can get more bandwidth, all right?\n\n500\n00:26:05.351 --> 00:26:08.076\nCuz we can make multiple connections and\n\n501\n00:26:08.076 --> 00:26:11.640\nwe can take advantage of\nall of that bandwidth.\n\n502\n00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:15.530\nSo we call them dynamic ports, and\nmany applications use dynamic ports.\n\n503\n00:26:15.530 --> 00:26:18.560\nThere's no preset port\nnumber that it's gonna use.\n\n504\n00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:20.920\nThey could change,\nthey could open up multiples.\n\n505\n00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:25.750\nSo if I do a port number, I'd have to know\nthose in advance, and I really can't.\n\n506\n00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:30.466\nBut if I do program, I was gonna say\nany port that that particular program\n\n507\n00:26:30.466 --> 00:26:32.719\nwants to open is okay, all right?\n\n508\n00:26:32.719 --> 00:26:36.388\nSo that's the big difference there\nbetween those two is when you do port,\n\n509\n00:26:36.388 --> 00:26:40.680\nit opens it up for everything, any program\nthat wants to use that port number.\n\n510\n00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:44.616\nWhen you do program, it allows that\nprogram to use that port and any port,\n\n511\n00:26:44.616 --> 00:26:45.135\nreally.\n\n512\n00:26:45.135 --> 00:26:46.695\nYou're not specifying what port.\n\n513\n00:26:46.695 --> 00:26:50.185\nYou're just specifying the program,\nall right?\n\n514\n00:26:50.185 --> 00:26:53.776\nAll right, so\nthat's probably good for that.\n\n515\n00:26:53.776 --> 00:26:57.440\nTo make a new rule,\nlet's just do a port number rule.\n\n516\n00:26:57.440 --> 00:27:00.039\nSo I'm gonna choose port number,\nand I'm gonna click Next.\n\n517\n00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:05.440\nAnd then I have to chose what I want,\nTCP or UDP, let's say it's TCP.\n\n518\n00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:10.220\nI could do all local ports or just\na specified port, and I'll make one up.\n\n519\n00:27:10.220 --> 00:27:11.698\nI'm just gonna say, 50001.\n\n520\n00:27:11.698 --> 00:27:14.029\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I had to actually look it up.\n\n521\n00:27:14.029 --> 00:27:16.330\nIt had been forever since\nI thought about it.\n\n522\n00:27:16.330 --> 00:27:18.572\nIt starts at 49152 for\nthose dynamic ephemeral ports.\n\n523\n00:27:18.572 --> 00:27:22.606\n&gt;&gt; Those are the dynamic port range,\nvery good.\n\n524\n00:27:22.606 --> 00:27:25.210\nAll right, so I'm gonna say click Next.\n\n525\n00:27:25.210 --> 00:27:26.458\nAnd then I wanna allow the connection.\n\n526\n00:27:26.458 --> 00:27:30.731\nAnd we're gonna come back to this Allow\nthe connection if it's secure option in\n\n527\n00:27:30.731 --> 00:27:33.005\njust a minute, but I have Allow or Block.\n\n528\n00:27:33.005 --> 00:27:35.450\nCuz I might not be setting up an allow.\n\n529\n00:27:35.450 --> 00:27:38.220\nLike I said, I might have\na program that I want to prevent\n\n530\n00:27:38.220 --> 00:27:39.870\nfrom accessing the Internet.\n\n531\n00:27:39.870 --> 00:27:43.540\nSo I wanna go, in this case, it would\nbe an outbound rule, I'm on inbound.\n\n532\n00:27:43.540 --> 00:27:47.270\nBut you might have a program that you\ndon't want reaching out and calling home.\n\n533\n00:27:47.270 --> 00:27:52.570\nSo I do an outbound rule, and then I could\nblock the connection instead of allow.\n\n534\n00:27:52.570 --> 00:27:54.573\nHere we're opening up port 50001.\n\n535\n00:27:54.573 --> 00:27:56.167\nI'll click Next.\n\n536\n00:27:56.167 --> 00:27:58.950\nNow I can choose what\nprofile to apply it to.\n\n537\n00:27:58.950 --> 00:28:03.276\nI'll leave it on all, actually,\nI don't wanna do it on public.\n\n538\n00:28:03.276 --> 00:28:05.060\nI'm gonna leave it on all just for\nthis lab,\n\n539\n00:28:05.060 --> 00:28:08.640\nbecause sometimes my virtual machines\ndon't detect the network properly and\n\n540\n00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:13.570\nthey can apply the wrong profile\nsometimes in my virtual environment.\n\n541\n00:28:13.570 --> 00:28:15.900\nSo I'm just gonna leave\nall of those checked.\n\n542\n00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:16.817\nI'll click Next.\n\n543\n00:28:16.817 --> 00:28:17.692\nI'll give it a name.\n\n544\n00:28:17.692 --> 00:28:24.199\nI'm gonna call this Allow 50001,\nand I'll click Finish.\n\n545\n00:28:27.089 --> 00:28:28.300\nOkay, there we go.\n\n546\n00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:30.130\nI have a new rule in place.\n\n547\n00:28:30.130 --> 00:28:33.810\nI can see that it's applied to\nall profiles, it is enabled.\n\n548\n00:28:33.810 --> 00:28:36.020\nIt's an Allow versus a Block.\n\n549\n00:28:36.020 --> 00:28:42.460\nAnd it tells me any program, any address,\nand that port number, and the protocol.\n\n550\n00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:48.650\nLet's do an outbound rule,\nand I'll do a new rule.\n\n551\n00:28:48.650 --> 00:28:53.150\nAnd this time, we'll do a program,\nand I'll click Next.\n\n552\n00:28:54.660 --> 00:29:01.870\nAnd then I'm gonna browse and find\nthe program that I want, maybe, maybe not.\n\n553\n00:29:01.870 --> 00:29:03.170\nWe'll see if it wants me to browse.\n\n554\n00:29:03.170 --> 00:29:06.470\nI guess I could just type it in there,\nbut now I've locked it up.\n\n555\n00:29:06.470 --> 00:29:09.442\nSo we'll give it just\na second to catch up with me.\n\n556\n00:29:10.958 --> 00:29:17.892\nYeah, it really is not\nhappy with me at all.\n\n557\n00:29:17.892 --> 00:29:20.065\nGive it just one second here.\n\n558\n00:29:20.065 --> 00:29:24.378\nBut as we go through this, cuz this time,\nI'm choosing program instead of port,\n\n559\n00:29:24.378 --> 00:29:28.251\nyou already see the big difference is\ninstead of specifying a protocol and\n\n560\n00:29:28.251 --> 00:29:30.831\na port number,\nI'm specifying a program name.\n\n561\n00:29:33.334 --> 00:29:35.740\nAnd-\n&gt;&gt; Mike broke his computer over there.\n\n562\n00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:36.391\n&gt;&gt; I really did.\n\n563\n00:29:36.391 --> 00:29:39.142\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It is not happy with me at all\n\n564\n00:29:39.142 --> 00:29:40.120\nright now.\n\n565\n00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:43.050\nSo give her just a second.\n\n566\n00:29:43.050 --> 00:29:44.580\nAnd what else do we need\nto talk about here?\n\n567\n00:29:44.580 --> 00:29:46.870\nSo we talked about inbound outbound rules.\n\n568\n00:29:46.870 --> 00:29:47.820\nHere it goes.\n\n569\n00:29:47.820 --> 00:29:49.123\nIt's slowly catching up.\n\n570\n00:29:54.046 --> 00:29:57.238\nLet's find Notepad.\n\n571\n00:29:57.238 --> 00:29:59.555\nHey, it's driving me crazy now.\n\n572\n00:29:59.555 --> 00:30:00.909\nThere it is.\n\n573\n00:30:04.596 --> 00:30:07.160\nThere we go,\nfinally got that path typed in there.\n\n574\n00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:08.867\nIt would have been faster\nif I just typed it myself.\n\n575\n00:30:08.867 --> 00:30:10.436\n&gt;&gt; This was really a show on patience.\n\n576\n00:30:10.436 --> 00:30:12.260\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n577\n00:30:12.260 --> 00:30:13.920\n&gt;&gt; Which I don't have much of.\n\n578\n00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:17.090\nAnd I'll click Next, and\nagain, Allow or Block.\n\n579\n00:30:17.090 --> 00:30:17.686\nAnd I'm gonna say Block.\n\n580\n00:30:17.686 --> 00:30:20.154\nI do not want Notepad\nrunning out to the Internet.\n\n581\n00:30:20.154 --> 00:30:22.120\nAnd we'll click Next.\n\n582\n00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:23.547\nAnd then what profile\ndo I wanna apply it on?\n\n583\n00:30:23.547 --> 00:30:25.300\nWe'll click Next.\n\n584\n00:30:25.300 --> 00:30:28.970\nI'll call this one Block Notepad.\n\n585\n00:30:28.970 --> 00:30:29.593\nI'll click Finish.\n\n586\n00:30:32.276 --> 00:30:34.850\nAnd Microsoft's saying,\nyou're not allowed to block Notepad.\n\n587\n00:30:34.850 --> 00:30:36.910\nNope, there it goes, all right, and I did.\n\n588\n00:30:36.910 --> 00:30:41.190\nI can see right up there on top of\nmy screen, I have my Block Notepad.\n\n589\n00:30:41.190 --> 00:30:45.254\nAnd I apologize for my computer\ngetting all kinds of cranky with me,\n\n590\n00:30:45.254 --> 00:30:47.325\nbut he is not-\n&gt;&gt; I was just thinking,\n\n591\n00:30:47.325 --> 00:30:51.479\nthat's probably a good idea or it's\ndefinitely not a bad idea to have some\n\n592\n00:30:51.479 --> 00:30:55.302\nkind of required employee training for\npatience if they work in IT.\n\n593\n00:30:55.302 --> 00:30:57.323\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, all right,\ngood luck with that one, right?\n\n594\n00:30:57.323 --> 00:30:59.218\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I know you're patient enough to sit\n\n595\n00:30:59.218 --> 00:31:01.175\nthrough the meeting if you\ndon't have a bad patience.\n\n596\n00:31:01.175 --> 00:31:05.400\n[LAUGH] All right,\nlet's see what else we got in here.\n\n597\n00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:09.390\nAgain, we're going to check out the\nconnection security rules in an upcoming\n\n598\n00:31:09.390 --> 00:31:10.240\nepisode.\n\n599\n00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:13.820\nI go to Monitoring and Firewall,\nit doesn't show me a whole lot.\n\n600\n00:31:13.820 --> 00:31:17.073\nIt just shows me, hey,\nthese are all the active rules,\n\n601\n00:31:17.073 --> 00:31:20.685\nwhereas these are all the pre-built rules,\nactive and not.\n\n602\n00:31:20.685 --> 00:31:24.570\nThis one is just showing me all of my\nactive rules, so a nice filtered list.\n\n603\n00:31:24.570 --> 00:31:27.100\nAnd there, I can see Block Notepad.\n\n604\n00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:28.730\nAnd what was our other one we did?\n\n605\n00:31:28.730 --> 00:31:31.890\nWe said-\n&gt;&gt; For the allow for the port?\n\n606\n00:31:31.890 --> 00:31:33.405\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I forgot what we allowed, though.\n\n607\n00:31:33.405 --> 00:31:36.873\n&gt;&gt; 500001.\n&gt;&gt; That's right, I said Allow 50001.\n\n608\n00:31:36.873 --> 00:31:37.914\nThat's right there.\n\n609\n00:31:37.914 --> 00:31:40.230\nThere it is, just above me,\nI just can't see it.\n\n610\n00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:44.150\nIt's my zoom tool that's making\neverything slow or something.\n\n611\n00:31:44.150 --> 00:31:47.080\nBut there it is right there, all right?\n\n612\n00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:49.570\nSo that is a look at the basic firewall,\n\n613\n00:31:49.570 --> 00:31:52.380\na little information about\nthe firewall itself.\n\n614\n00:31:52.380 --> 00:31:55.220\nAgain, the key to remember is\n\n615\n00:31:55.220 --> 00:31:57.410\nthat we've got three different\nnetwork profiles, right?\n\n616\n00:31:57.410 --> 00:31:59.630\nAnd my firewall rules can be different.\n\n617\n00:31:59.630 --> 00:32:02.950\nEvery rule that we created so far,\nincluding the ones that are already\n\n618\n00:32:02.950 --> 00:32:08.000\ncreated, I can always go into one of those\nexisting rules and I can make changes.\n\n619\n00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:13.430\nDepending on the rule, some of these\nare not a lot of things I can change.\n\n620\n00:32:13.430 --> 00:32:17.705\nLet's find one that I can go back to.\n\n621\n00:32:17.705 --> 00:32:20.250\nLet's find, I don't know what this is.\n\n622\n00:32:20.250 --> 00:32:23.170\nAll right, so here's an existing rule.\n\n623\n00:32:23.170 --> 00:32:24.204\nAnd it's set to allow, right?\n\n624\n00:32:24.204 --> 00:32:28.186\nSo it's an inbound rule\nallowing this Alljoyn router.\n\n625\n00:32:28.186 --> 00:32:32.120\nAnd I probably said that all wrong,\nbut it's okay.\n\n626\n00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:36.997\nAnd I can come over here to,\nwhere am I, Protocols and Ports.\n\n627\n00:32:36.997 --> 00:32:41.830\nYeah, this one isn't letting\nme make a lot of changes.\n\n628\n00:32:41.830 --> 00:32:45.410\nBut on the Advanced tab, this is really\nwhat I was coming in here to show you.\n\n629\n00:32:45.410 --> 00:32:50.560\nI might choose to turn this on on\nthe public profile as well, or\n\n630\n00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:52.950\njust on the private,\nor just on the domain.\n\n631\n00:32:52.950 --> 00:32:57.110\nAnd long story short, what I was trying to\nget back around to was important thing to\n\n632\n00:32:57.110 --> 00:33:03.050\nremember for this exam is that my\nfirewall rules on a per profile basis.\n\n633\n00:33:03.050 --> 00:33:09.225\nI might see one rule, but it might apply\nto two or all three of those profiles.\n\n634\n00:33:09.225 --> 00:33:10.400\nSo keep that in mind.\n\n635\n00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:11.820\nIt's a big improvement.\n\n636\n00:33:11.820 --> 00:33:15.564\nIt's not new, but it is something you need\nto be aware of when you go in that exam,\n\n637\n00:33:15.564 --> 00:33:18.550\nthat firewall rules\nare based on profile and\n\n638\n00:33:18.550 --> 00:33:23.250\nwe can allow a port on one profile,\nbut block a port on another.\n\n639\n00:33:23.250 --> 00:33:25.368\nAnd you have two different controls for\nthe firewall.\n\n640\n00:33:25.368 --> 00:33:28.176\nYou got the basic Windows Defender\nfirewall console, and\n\n641\n00:33:28.176 --> 00:33:31.329\nyou have the Windows Defender Firewall\nwith Advanced Security,\n\n642\n00:33:31.329 --> 00:33:34.410\nwhich is gonna give you\nmore granular control.\n\n643\n00:33:34.410 --> 00:33:35.820\nOnly one firewall, though, right?\n\n644\n00:33:35.820 --> 00:33:42.250\nBoth of those tools are managing that\nsingle Windows Defender Firewall.\n\n645\n00:33:42.250 --> 00:33:45.340\n&gt;&gt; Awesome, Mike, thanks for walking us\nthrough both of those ways that we can go\n\n646\n00:33:45.340 --> 00:33:47.450\nahead and set that up and\ncreate those new rules.\n\n647\n00:33:47.450 --> 00:33:49.830\nDo you have any final thoughts\nbefore we wrap this up today?\n\n648\n00:33:49.830 --> 00:33:51.049\n&gt;&gt; I don't wanna give anything away for\n\n649\n00:33:51.049 --> 00:33:53.659\nour upcoming episode with connection\nsecurity rules, so I think I'll wait.\n\n650\n00:33:53.659 --> 00:33:57.740\n&gt;&gt; Okay, all right, so\nyou don't wanna miss that.\n\n651\n00:33:57.740 --> 00:33:59.030\nSo for now, let's sign out.\n\n652\n00:33:59.030 --> 00:34:00.530\nI've been your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n653\n00:34:00.530 --> 00:34:01.280\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n654\n00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:02.689\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here on ITProTV.\n\n655\n00:34:02.689 --> 00:34:10.129\n[MUSIC]\n\n656\n00:34:10.129 -->

00:00:08.227\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.227 --> 00:00:11.664\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.664 --> 00:00:14.920\n&gt;&gt; Welcome everyone to your\nConfiguring Windows Devices series,\n\n6\n00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:17.030\nstudying for that 70-697 exam.\n\n7\n00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:19.475\nI'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n8\n00:00:19.475 --> 00:00:22.677\nIn this episode, we'll be coming\nback to look at Part Two where we\n\n9\n00:00:22.677 --> 00:00:26.240\nwill continue to take a look at\nhow to configure network security.\n\n10\n00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.314\nAnd of course, with us today in studios,\nwe have Mr. Mike Rodrick.\n\n11\n00:00:29.314 --> 00:00:29.817\nHow's it going today?\n\n12\n00:00:29.817 --> 00:00:32.790\n&gt;&gt; It's going great,\nCherokee.Thanks for having me back,\n\n13\n00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.840\nexcited as always to be here at ITProTV.\n\n14\n00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.129\nAnd yeah, continuing on with\nnetwork security, right?\n\n15\n00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:39.940\nWe looked at firewalls in that first part.\n\n16\n00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:44.588\nSo if you miss that go back and check that\nout, and we're talking about how firewalls\n\n17\n00:00:44.588 --> 00:00:47.994\nare gonna allow me to control what\ntraffic is allowed to go in or\n\n18\n00:00:47.994 --> 00:00:50.106\nout of a particular machine, right?\n\n19\n00:00:50.106 --> 00:00:53.206\nAnd we'll talk again,\nthis is for the Windows 10 exam,\n\n20\n00:00:53.206 --> 00:00:56.130\nwhich you guys can take that\nconcept further, right?\n\n21\n00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:58.257\nThe router at the edge of your network,\nthat border router.\n\n22\n00:00:58.257 --> 00:01:00.670\nIt's doing the same thing,\njust on a bigger scale.\n\n23\n00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.573\nIt's controlling all traffic\nthat's allowed to come in and\n\n24\n00:01:04.573 --> 00:01:05.957\nout of your network.\n\n25\n00:01:05.957 --> 00:01:08.960\nTypically you'll see multiple\nrouters in enterprise.\n\n26\n00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.783\nYou got your border routers that\nprotect your corporate LAN, and\n\n27\n00:01:11.783 --> 00:01:14.463\nthen individual machines\ntypically have firewalls as well.\n\n28\n00:01:14.463 --> 00:01:19.246\nAnd actually kinda something that\ndidn't happen years ago was you put\n\n29\n00:01:19.246 --> 00:01:23.230\na firewall at the edge of your network and\nyou call it a day.\n\n30\n00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:25.375\nAnd you said, all right, we're good,\nwe've built a wall around us.\n\n31\n00:01:25.375 --> 00:01:26.095\nNothing can happen now.\n\n32\n00:01:26.095 --> 00:01:31.086\nAnd we soon learned that that was not\nthe best strategy because if something did\n\n33\n00:01:31.086 --> 00:01:35.260\nmake it through the wall,\nthere's nothing left to slow it down.\n\n34\n00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:39.394\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you'll hear that a lot now\nbehind the firewall for that strategy.\n\n35\n00:01:39.394 --> 00:01:44.308\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm yes, so it's not uncommon to have\nmany firewalls in route, which is probably\n\n36\n00:01:44.308 --> 00:01:49.220\nsomething I should have mentioned that\nprevious one but let's mention that.\n\n37\n00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.248\nIf you're on a corporate network and\nyou're trying to allow certain traffic to\n\n38\n00:01:53.248 --> 00:01:56.745\ncome through, let's say I wanna\nremote into my computer from home.\n\n39\n00:01:56.745 --> 00:02:01.256\nSo I go to my work PC, I open up that\nfirewall and I allow remote desktop or\n\n40\n00:02:01.256 --> 00:02:05.570\nport 3389 through that firewall and\nthen I go home.\n\n41\n00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:07.684\nAnd we're gonna forget about the fact\nthat I've got a private IP address.\n\n42\n00:02:07.684 --> 00:02:10.050\nWe'll take that out of the equation for\na second.\n\n43\n00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.760\nI go home and\nI try to remote into it and I can't.\n\n44\n00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.671\nAnd that's because there's probably\nother firewalls in between me and\n\n45\n00:02:16.671 --> 00:02:20.324\nthe destination that would all have\nto be set up to allow that traffic\n\n46\n00:02:20.324 --> 00:02:21.590\nto come through.\n\n47\n00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.821\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and even if you think\nof things like databases,\n\n48\n00:02:24.821 --> 00:02:29.386\nthere may even be a dedicated firewall\njust in front of those database servers\n\n49\n00:02:29.386 --> 00:02:32.497\nbecause it may have highly\nsensitive information.\n\n50\n00:02:32.497 --> 00:02:35.548\nSo there needs to be\nan additional layer or\n\n51\n00:02:35.548 --> 00:02:40.320\nlevel of access granted for\nthose particular machine access.\n\n52\n00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.362\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so when we talk about this\nWindows Defender Firewall for this Windows\n\n53\n00:02:44.362 --> 00:02:48.357\n10 exam, we wanna remember this is\nwhat's called a host-based firewall.\n\n54\n00:02:48.357 --> 00:02:51.680\nAnd this firewall doesn't,\nit only protects this one host.\n\n55\n00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.834\nIt doesn't do anything for\nCherokee's machine,\n\n56\n00:02:53.834 --> 00:02:55.894\nany of the other machines\nout here on my network.\n\n57\n00:02:55.894 --> 00:02:59.340\nMy host-based firewall is\nonly protecting my host.\n\n58\n00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.822\nNetwork-based firewalls would\nsit out there on the border, or\n\n59\n00:03:02.822 --> 00:03:06.498\nin front of my subnet or in front of\nan important backbone subnet with\n\n60\n00:03:06.498 --> 00:03:08.706\nmy data servers or something like that.\n\n61\n00:03:08.706 --> 00:03:11.820\nWe have extra levels of protection there.\n\n62\n00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:15.817\nAll right, so now, so we've said firewalls\nare gonna help me control what traffic is\n\n63\n00:03:15.817 --> 00:03:17.662\nallowed to go in and out of my computer.\n\n64\n00:03:17.662 --> 00:03:22.390\nThe other aspect of network security is\nto protect the traffic itself, right?\n\n65\n00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:25.716\nI can allow or block the traffic but\nthat traffic that I do allow,\n\n66\n00:03:25.716 --> 00:03:28.750\nis there anything else we can\ndo to add protection to that?\n\n67\n00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.640\nAnd the answer of course is yes.\n\n68\n00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.803\nFirst and foremost,\nwe can authenticate the traffic, right?\n\n69\n00:03:33.803 --> 00:03:36.800\nWe can verify the sender.\n\n70\n00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.995\nI wanna know who that is\nthat's sending me that.\n\n71\n00:03:38.995 --> 00:03:43.066\nI think I know but won't it be nice to\nbe nice to be sure who was sending in\n\n72\n00:03:43.066 --> 00:03:44.950\nthat information, all right?\n\n73\n00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:46.415\nThat's authentication.\n\n74\n00:03:46.415 --> 00:03:49.300\nWe can also talk about encryption.\n\n75\n00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:52.315\nI might want to encrypt that\ntraffic by applying encryption.\n\n76\n00:03:52.315 --> 00:03:54.690\nEncryptions will take plain text.\n\n77\n00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:58.479\nAnd when you run it through an algorithm,\nthat converts it into ciphertext or\n\n78\n00:03:58.479 --> 00:04:00.638\nsomething that's not human readable, and\n\n79\n00:04:00.638 --> 00:04:03.690\nyou can only decrypt it with\nthe appropriate decryption key.\n\n80\n00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:09.930\nAnd that's gonna protect different types,\neavesdropping type of of text, all right?\n\n81\n00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:14.810\nSo those are the two things we're\nreally gonna discuss in this episode,\n\n82\n00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:19.770\nand now is gonna come to be, that's\nthe way to say it, through connection\n\n83\n00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:24.573\nsecurity rules and IP set, or\nan Internet Protocol security, right?\n\n84\n00:04:24.573 --> 00:04:29.040\nSo connection security rules are something\nwe saw in our firewall console.\n\n85\n00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.974\nWe're gonna take another look\nat them here in just a minute.\n\n86\n00:04:30.974 --> 00:04:34.610\nAnd these are what allow me to\ncontrol the connection, right?\n\n87\n00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:37.722\nConnection security,\nthink about that as you're studying.\n\n88\n00:04:37.722 --> 00:04:38.496\nIt'll help you remember.\n\n89\n00:04:38.496 --> 00:04:41.880\nI'm securing the connection itself.\n\n90\n00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.745\nI'm gonna verify the other\nend of that conversation.\n\n91\n00:04:44.745 --> 00:04:48.835\nI wanna make sure I really am\ntalking to a particular server or\n\n92\n00:04:48.835 --> 00:04:51.670\nwhatever the case may be, right?\n\n93\n00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:55.786\n&gt;&gt; So Mike, what you're saying is we're\nnot actually providing that enrcryption or\n\n94\n00:04:55.786 --> 00:04:59.255\nsecuring the data that may be\ntransmitting between that connection,\n\n95\n00:04:59.255 --> 00:05:00.743\njust the connection itself.\n\n96\n00:05:00.743 --> 00:05:01.910\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, right.\n\n97\n00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:03.919\nAnd that's an important\nconcept to remember and\n\n98\n00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:06.477\nyou'll see it as we go through\nthe wizard here and set this up.\n\n99\n00:05:06.477 --> 00:05:10.770\nConnection security rules are only dealing\nwith the authentication portion, right?\n\n100\n00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:12.620\nThey're not dealing with encryption.\n\n101\n00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:17.160\nIP sec or Internet Protocol security,\nis what allows me to wrap those\n\n102\n00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:22.664\npackets up and protect them as\nthey're traveling across the network.\n\n103\n00:05:22.664 --> 00:05:25.313\nAll right, so\nlet's take a look at my screen here.\n\n104\n00:05:25.313 --> 00:05:28.227\nI'm on my Windows 10 domain machine and\n\n105\n00:05:28.227 --> 00:05:34.320\nwe're gonna go right back into that\nWindows Firewall with advanced security.\n\n106\n00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:38.304\nAnd this is really what brought about,\nwell, I shouldn't say that, inbound and\n\n107\n00:05:38.304 --> 00:05:39.182\noutbound rules.\n\n108\n00:05:39.182 --> 00:05:42.350\nI was trying to differentiate\nbetween the two consoles.\n\n109\n00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:44.175\nAnd I remember when this first came out,\n\n110\n00:05:44.175 --> 00:05:46.328\nthe Windows firewall\nwith advanced security.\n\n111\n00:05:46.328 --> 00:05:50.176\nAnd one of the big things that it did\nother than break out the rules between\n\n112\n00:05:50.176 --> 00:05:54.525\ninbound and outbound was it added\nthose connection security rules here.\n\n113\n00:05:54.525 --> 00:05:59.301\nAnd it's really handy that they did\nthat because when we work with these,\n\n114\n00:05:59.301 --> 00:06:03.309\nwhat you'll find is that as we\ndefine authentication rules,\n\n115\n00:06:03.309 --> 00:06:06.796\nas we define IP sec policies\nto control that traffic.\n\n116\n00:06:06.796 --> 00:06:09.195\nWe still have to create\nthe firewall exceptions.\n\n117\n00:06:09.195 --> 00:06:10.990\nWe were talking about this between shows.\n\n118\n00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:15.649\nIf I choose to encrypt any traffic going\nover port 3389, that's all well and\n\n119\n00:06:15.649 --> 00:06:19.074\ngood but I still have to make\nthe exception in the firewall or\n\n120\n00:06:19.074 --> 00:06:21.770\nthe traffic's not gonna\nbe allowed through.\n\n121\n00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:24.325\n&gt;&gt; The traffic will be encrypted but\nit'll just be stuck there at the door.\n\n122\n00:06:24.325 --> 00:06:25.424\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly, right?\n\n123\n00:06:25.424 --> 00:06:27.680\nYou're not even gonna\nestablish a connection to say,\n\n124\n00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:29.640\nhey, you need to encrypt that.\n\n125\n00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:30.176\nIt's gonna be blocked.\n\n126\n00:06:30.176 --> 00:06:33.368\nSo it's nice that they kinda combine\nthese into this one console,\n\n127\n00:06:33.368 --> 00:06:36.788\nfirewall with advanced security, so\nthat I don't have to go to three or\n\n128\n00:06:36.788 --> 00:06:40.400\nfour different places to\nconfigure this kind of thing.\n\n129\n00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:43.934\nAll right, so let's take a look at\na good old connection security rule and\n\n130\n00:06:43.934 --> 00:06:45.758\nthen we'll see how they, actually,\n\n131\n00:06:45.758 --> 00:06:49.697\nbefore we do that, let's talk about how\nwe would use connection security rules.\n\n132\n00:06:49.697 --> 00:06:51.245\n&gt;&gt; Okay, Mike, so\nthis sounds really great but\n\n133\n00:06:51.245 --> 00:06:53.300\nare you gonna actually show\nus how to set this up?\n\n134\n00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:57.138\nYes, so let's take a look, and let's talk\nabout some of the different types of\n\n135\n00:06:57.138 --> 00:07:00.807\nconnection security rules that we can\ncreate, and we'll start going in and\n\n136\n00:07:00.807 --> 00:07:02.782\ncreating some and seeing how they work.\n\n137\n00:07:02.782 --> 00:07:06.590\nSo I'm gonna right-click on Connection\nSecurity Rules over here in my console,\n\n138\n00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:09.360\nand I'm gonna choose New Rule,\njust to pull up the wizard.\n\n139\n00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:13.071\nAnd we're gonna take a look at\nthese different rules I can create.\n\n140\n00:07:13.071 --> 00:07:16.801\nSo I've got Isolation,\nAuthentication exemption,\n\n141\n00:07:16.801 --> 00:07:21.190\nServer-to-server, Tunnel,\nand Custom rules, all right?\n\n142\n00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:21.981\nSo isolation.\n\n143\n00:07:21.981 --> 00:07:25.657\nRestrict connections based on\nauthentication criteria such as\n\n144\n00:07:25.657 --> 00:07:28.480\ndomain membership or health status.\n\n145\n00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:33.866\nAnd this is one that we can use to, you\nhear this referred to as domain isolation.\n\n146\n00:07:33.866 --> 00:07:39.030\nAnd what I'm trying to do is restrict\nall communications to domain members.\n\n147\n00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:43.860\nOnly members of my domain are allowed\nto communicate with other members of my\n\n148\n00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:44.470\ndomain.\n\n149\n00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:48.270\nIf you're not part of the domain you\ncan't talk to any domain members.\n\n150\n00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:53.232\nSo we're isolating, right,\nour domain from everything else.\n\n151\n00:07:53.232 --> 00:07:57.173\nWe can do this within a indication\nwith Kerberos, right?\n\n152\n00:07:57.173 --> 00:08:01.523\nIf you're a member of the domain\n&gt;&gt; You're gonna have a computer account in\n\n153\n00:08:01.523 --> 00:08:04.557\nActive Directory and\nI can use that for my authentication.\n\n154\n00:08:04.557 --> 00:08:08.022\nI can say only if the computer can\nauthenticate, prove that it's got\n\n155\n00:08:08.022 --> 00:08:11.802\nan account and it knows the password\nis it allowed to make that connection.\n\n156\n00:08:11.802 --> 00:08:16.581\nWe can also do what's known as server\nisolation where instead of being\n\n157\n00:08:16.581 --> 00:08:22.890\nthe entire domain, we can restrict who's\nallowed to speak to a certain server.\n\n158\n00:08:22.890 --> 00:08:25.415\nWe might have a server that\nhas sensitive data on there.\n\n159\n00:08:25.415 --> 00:08:29.937\nYou were talking about SQL back-end\ndatabase type things where most of our web\n\n160\n00:08:29.937 --> 00:08:34.663\nservers are 3-tier, n-tier type setups and\nour web server has to reach back and\n\n161\n00:08:34.663 --> 00:08:36.510\ntalk to that database server.\n\n162\n00:08:36.510 --> 00:08:38.379\nAnd that's where all those\ncustomer information,\n\n163\n00:08:38.379 --> 00:08:40.045\npossibly credit card\ninformation is stored.\n\n164\n00:08:40.045 --> 00:08:44.030\nSo I really wanna control who's\nable to connect to that server.\n\n165\n00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:45.256\nI can setup server isolation.\n\n166\n00:08:45.256 --> 00:08:49.660\nI can say, you have to authenticate\nto talk to that back-end server.\n\n167\n00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:53.692\nAnd only these three IP addresses\nare allowed to even try to authenticate or\n\n168\n00:08:53.692 --> 00:08:56.644\nto successfully authenticate,\nI guess I should say.\n\n169\n00:08:56.644 --> 00:08:59.261\nAnybody can try, but\nsuccessfully authenticate.\n\n170\n00:08:59.261 --> 00:09:03.399\n&gt;&gt; And I mean, even sometimes\nthe authentication like triple A or\n\n171\n00:09:03.399 --> 00:09:04.500\nradius server.\n\n172\n00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:09.004\nIf I have the server at the perimeter of\nmy network, I may only allow connection\n\n173\n00:09:09.004 --> 00:09:13.509\nfrom maybe I have five travelling sales\npeople and I know their IP addresses and\n\n174\n00:09:13.509 --> 00:09:18.012\nI only want those five individual to try\nto gain remote access to my network, so\n\n175\n00:09:18.012 --> 00:09:22.541\nI'm just gonna put their IP address and\nthen not allow any other connections.\n\n176\n00:09:22.541 --> 00:09:26.560\nSo just knowing that, that is a viable\noption for us is pretty cool.\n\n177\n00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:28.468\n&gt;&gt; Exactly and when I say authentication,\n\n178\n00:09:28.468 --> 00:09:31.789\nwe can setup the authentication\nthrough a couple of different means.\n\n179\n00:09:31.789 --> 00:09:34.717\nWe can use Kerberos for\nboth the computer and the user.\n\n180\n00:09:34.717 --> 00:09:39.115\nSo I can authenticate just the computer or\nthe computer and the user, or\n\n181\n00:09:39.115 --> 00:09:41.410\njust the user unsing Cerberus.\n\n182\n00:09:41.410 --> 00:09:42.587\nKeep in mind, Kerberos,\n\n183\n00:09:42.587 --> 00:09:46.119\nthough is one of the protocols we use\nin Active Directory for authentication.\n\n184\n00:09:46.119 --> 00:09:49.630\nIf you're not part of the domain,\nyou can't use Kerberos.\n\n185\n00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:52.232\nSo if I was setting this up and for\ndomain isolations, that's fine.\n\n186\n00:09:52.232 --> 00:09:53.916\nThat's what we're trying to do.\n\n187\n00:09:53.916 --> 00:09:56.424\nBut if I wanted to include\nnon-domain members and\n\n188\n00:09:56.424 --> 00:10:00.540\nallow them to connect to resources,\nKerberos would not be the way to go.\n\n189\n00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:03.004\nBecause they're not gonna be able\nto authenticate using Kerberos,\n\n190\n00:10:03.004 --> 00:10:04.159\nthey're not part of my domain.\n\n191\n00:10:04.159 --> 00:10:07.533\nIn that case, I would be using\ncertificates most likely for\n\n192\n00:10:07.533 --> 00:10:08.910\nauthentication.\n\n193\n00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:11.440\nBecause I can issue certificates\nto all my domain members,\n\n194\n00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:12.862\nas well as non-domain members.\n\n195\n00:10:12.862 --> 00:10:16.590\nSo now they can come to the party and\nthey can talk to some of my servers, but\n\n196\n00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:18.760\nonly if I've issued you a certificate.\n\n197\n00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:22.437\nI issued a certificate to Cherokee's\ncomputer, it's not part of my domain.\n\n198\n00:10:22.437 --> 00:10:26.423\nIt would be allowed to authenticate\nwhereas Nate's computer or\n\n199\n00:10:26.423 --> 00:10:31.610\nsomebody else's computer wouldn't be\nallowed if I didn't issue A certificate.\n\n200\n00:10:32.650 --> 00:10:38.451\nWe can also do authentication exemptions\nand this is where we can exempt server or\n\n201\n00:10:38.451 --> 00:10:42.652\ncertain machines from\nthe authentication requirement.\n\n202\n00:10:42.652 --> 00:10:46.710\nThis is typically done for\nmost of your infrastructure servers.\n\n203\n00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:51.157\nWe don't want a DNS, DHCP.\n\n204\n00:10:51.157 --> 00:10:56.211\nThose types of services need to be\navailable to everybody on the network\n\n205\n00:10:56.211 --> 00:11:01.096\nwhether it's a guest computer,\na lab machine you're spinning up,\n\n206\n00:11:01.096 --> 00:11:03.896\nan on demand member, domain members.\n\n207\n00:11:03.896 --> 00:11:07.200\nEverybody needs to be able\nto talk to the DHCP server.\n\n208\n00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:09.348\nEverybody needs to be able\nto talk to the DNS server.\n\n209\n00:11:09.348 --> 00:11:12.320\nEverybody needs to be able to\ntalk to the domain controller.\n\n210\n00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:16.744\nMost of those services have some like\nActive Directory has built-in mechanisms\n\n211\n00:11:16.744 --> 00:11:18.771\nfor securing that traffic already.\n\n212\n00:11:18.771 --> 00:11:22.492\nSo there's really no\nneed to double up on it.\n\n213\n00:11:22.492 --> 00:11:26.135\nDNS and DHCP, we can cause a lot\nof problems on our network if we\n\n214\n00:11:26.135 --> 00:11:30.970\nstart requiring authentication for\neverything to every single machine.\n\n215\n00:11:30.970 --> 00:11:35.477\nSo Microsoft will recommend that your\ninfrastructure servers typically are going\n\n216\n00:11:35.477 --> 00:11:38.243\nto be exempt from any\nconnection security rules and\n\n217\n00:11:38.243 --> 00:11:40.187\nthat's what this allowed me to do.\n\n218\n00:11:40.187 --> 00:11:41.628\n[COUGH] We can create groups and\n\n219\n00:11:41.628 --> 00:11:45.010\nwe can define this through\nActive Directory security groups.\n\n220\n00:11:45.010 --> 00:11:47.923\nAdd members to the group and\nthen add the group to this wizard.\n\n221\n00:11:47.923 --> 00:11:52.590\nYou can use IP address ranges\nlike particular subnets, as well.\n\n222\n00:11:53.870 --> 00:11:56.438\nService server, authenticate connection\nbetween the specified computer.\n\n223\n00:11:56.438 --> 00:11:56.946\nSo here,\n\n224\n00:11:56.946 --> 00:12:01.390\nwe're just talking about a straight\nserver to server not anybody else.\n\n225\n00:12:01.390 --> 00:12:05.116\nThis could be, again, another use for\nthat web front-end, server back-end,\n\n226\n00:12:05.116 --> 00:12:07.300\nSQL back-end, kind of thing.\n\n227\n00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:12.237\nTunnels, typically,\nwe're gonna be using these between\n\n228\n00:12:12.237 --> 00:12:16.098\nlocations like if we're\ndoing a site to site.\n\n229\n00:12:16.098 --> 00:12:21.770\nIn this case, they say, authenticate\nconnection between two computers.\n\n230\n00:12:21.770 --> 00:12:26.688\nSo we're specifying endpoints for\nthis tunnel and we're gonna allow that to\n\n231\n00:12:26.688 --> 00:12:30.406\nsetup a tunnel that all\nthe traffic that can flow through.\n\n232\n00:12:30.406 --> 00:12:32.763\nAnd then you have custom rule, of course,\n\n233\n00:12:32.763 --> 00:12:36.110\nwhich means I get to go through\nall of the available options.\n\n234\n00:12:37.290 --> 00:12:41.583\nSo those are our different options and I\nthought what we would do is we would kind\n\n235\n00:12:41.583 --> 00:12:44.068\nof test some of this out,\nand see what we got.\n\n236\n00:12:44.068 --> 00:12:45.375\nSound like fun?\n\n237\n00:12:45.375 --> 00:12:49.310\n&gt;&gt; So are we just rolling the dice and\nchoosing which one we're gonna setup?\n\n238\n00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:50.230\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n239\n00:12:50.230 --> 00:12:52.190\nLets do a little more than that.\n\n240\n00:12:52.190 --> 00:12:54.423\nWhat I've got here,\nI've got a server over here.\n\n241\n00:12:54.423 --> 00:12:58.053\nAnd remote desktop is turned on,\nif I'm not mistaken.\n\n242\n00:12:58.053 --> 00:12:59.743\nSo I got remote desktop enabled.\n\n243\n00:12:59.743 --> 00:13:02.840\nAnd remember and again,\nthis isn't the server class.\n\n244\n00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:07.443\nBut when I turn this on, it made the\nexception for me in the firewall for 3389.\n\n245\n00:13:07.443 --> 00:13:09.966\nSo if I go back over to this client,\n\n246\n00:13:09.966 --> 00:13:14.925\nI should be able to fire up remote\ndesktop and connect to server 4 and\n\n247\n00:13:14.925 --> 00:13:19.900\nI can already tell I'm connecting\nbecause it's asking me who I am.\n\n248\n00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:25.343\nSo if I type in my super secret password,\nI can connect to that server remotely.\n\n249\n00:13:25.343 --> 00:13:25.879\nThere it is.\n\n250\n00:13:25.879 --> 00:13:30.730\nServer 4, no problem and\nI'll go ahead and close that connection.\n\n251\n00:13:30.730 --> 00:13:33.028\nNow, if I go to a non-domain\nmember over here.\n\n252\n00:13:33.028 --> 00:13:38.980\nSo this is not joined to the domain and\n\n253\n00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:43.030\nI'm gonna login maybe.\n\n254\n00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:44.216\n&gt;&gt; That looks nice.\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n\n255\n00:13:44.216 --> 00:13:44.784\n&gt;&gt; It's camping out.\n\n256\n00:13:44.784 --> 00:13:46.434\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It is a pretty picture.\n\n257\n00:13:46.434 --> 00:13:51.300\nBut this one screen, I don't know if I've\ngot to update that, that background.\n\n258\n00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:54.064\nBut anyway,\nlet me get into remote desktop.\n\n259\n00:13:54.064 --> 00:13:56.130\nI thought that was my lock screen for\na second.\n\n260\n00:13:56.130 --> 00:13:58.980\nI kept waiting for\nmy authentication dialogue, crazy.\n\n261\n00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:01.830\nI click Connect.\n\n262\n00:14:01.830 --> 00:14:03.252\nAnd look at there, I can connect.\n\n263\n00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:07.604\nEven from a non-domain member.\n\n264\n00:14:07.604 --> 00:14:10.280\nSo port 3389 is open.\n\n265\n00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:11.180\nAnd as long as I've got\n\n266\n00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:13.950\ncredentials that are allowed to make\nthat connection, we're good to go.\n\n267\n00:14:15.130 --> 00:14:19.800\nSo now, we got our baseline and\nlet's see what we can do and\n\n268\n00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:21.820\nI don't know why there's\nsome audio going on here.\n\n269\n00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:24.931\nI'm gonna turn that off.\n\n270\n00:14:24.931 --> 00:14:27.000\nI'm gonna be doing these.\n\n271\n00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:27.924\nI'm gonna start on the server.\n\n272\n00:14:27.924 --> 00:14:29.670\nWe'll see both sides of it.\n\n273\n00:14:30.930 --> 00:14:33.297\nIt's the same wizard client versus server,\n\n274\n00:14:33.297 --> 00:14:37.357\nso it's not going to affect you study-wise\nthat I'm doing this on a server.\n\n275\n00:14:37.357 --> 00:14:42.217\nAnd I'm gonna open up by Windows Firewall\nwith advanced security and\n\n276\n00:14:42.217 --> 00:14:46.080\nwe're going to go down to\nconnection security rules.\n\n277\n00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:52.573\nAnd just to show you, if I go to\ninbound rules and lookup remote,\n\n278\n00:14:52.573 --> 00:14:55.567\nthere's three rules right there for.\n\n279\n00:14:55.567 --> 00:14:57.780\nAnd now, my ZoomIt doesn't want to work.\n\n280\n00:14:57.780 --> 00:14:59.728\nIt's just one of those days.\n\n281\n00:14:59.728 --> 00:15:03.550\nJust fire up ZoomIt.\n\n282\n00:15:06.164 --> 00:15:12.073\nYou know, Cherokee,\nwhen it rains, it pours.\n\n283\n00:15:12.073 --> 00:15:13.516\nDoesn't it?\n\n284\n00:15:13.516 --> 00:15:17.270\n&gt;&gt; Well, the good news is Mike,\nit doesn't just happen to you.\n\n285\n00:15:17.270 --> 00:15:20.460\n&gt;&gt; Well-\n&gt;&gt; I think everyone knows.\n\n286\n00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:21.797\n&gt;&gt; So ZoomIt, isn't?\n\n287\n00:15:21.797 --> 00:15:24.850\nSomehow I don't even have\nZoomIt on this machine.\n\n288\n00:15:24.850 --> 00:15:25.524\nLet me go grab it real quick.\n\n289\n00:15:25.524 --> 00:15:27.583\nZoomIt, for those of you who are curious.\n\n290\n00:15:27.583 --> 00:15:32.458\nZoomIt, the program we use to let\nyou guys see the teeny-tiny text\n\n291\n00:15:32.458 --> 00:15:34.557\nthat shows up on our screen.\n\n292\n00:15:34.557 --> 00:15:38.050\nSo let me just run this real quick,\nso that I can zoom.\n\n293\n00:15:38.050 --> 00:15:41.105\nEvidently, we haven't used this server for\nmuch just yet.\n\n294\n00:15:41.105 --> 00:15:41.833\n&gt;&gt; It's kind of funny.\n\n295\n00:15:41.833 --> 00:15:44.613\nMonitors keep getting larger.\n\n296\n00:15:44.613 --> 00:15:47.013\nI guess it depends,\nbecause a lot of tablets aren't.\n\n297\n00:15:47.013 --> 00:15:49.530\nBut the text keeps getting smaller.\n\n298\n00:15:49.530 --> 00:15:51.070\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n299\n00:15:51.070 --> 00:15:52.028\nmy eyes keep getting worse and worse.\n\n300\n00:15:52.028 --> 00:15:54.203\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But anyway,\n\n301\n00:15:54.203 --> 00:15:55.278\nthere is the three programs.\n\n302\n00:15:55.278 --> 00:15:57.721\nZoomIt is great.\n\n303\n00:15:57.721 --> 00:15:59.496\nGreat tool by Systurnals or\nWinturnals now.\n\n304\n00:15:59.496 --> 00:16:01.078\nBut it's a free one you can go get.\n\n305\n00:16:01.078 --> 00:16:03.810\nSo you can see there are exceptions for\nremote desktops.\n\n306\n00:16:03.810 --> 00:16:07.250\nSo that's why that connection\nis being allowed, right?\n\n307\n00:16:07.250 --> 00:16:11.390\nBecause there is an exception in the\nfirewall saying yes allow remote desktops\n\n308\n00:16:11.390 --> 00:16:13.680\nto come through the firewall, inbound.\n\n309\n00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:17.360\nSo I am gonna go to connection security\nrules and we are gonna create a new rule.\n\n310\n00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:20.790\nSo I'm gonna right click, New Rule and\n\n311\n00:16:20.790 --> 00:16:23.960\nwe're gonna do Isolation,\nall right, and I'll click Next.\n\n312\n00:16:25.270 --> 00:16:28.380\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead and\nrequest authentication for inbound and\n\n313\n00:16:28.380 --> 00:16:30.060\noutbound connections.\n\n314\n00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:31.530\nThe other options that we have here.\n\n315\n00:16:31.530 --> 00:16:34.510\nI've got Request authentication for\ninbound and outbound,\n\n316\n00:16:34.510 --> 00:16:39.400\nI've got Require inbound,\nrequest outbound.\n\n317\n00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:41.730\nAnd then I also have\nrequire authentication for\n\n318\n00:16:41.730 --> 00:16:43.590\nboth inbound and outbound.\n\n319\n00:16:43.590 --> 00:16:44.790\n&gt;&gt; Seems pretty restrictive, right?\n\n320\n00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:48.380\n&gt;&gt; Yes, but pretty straight forward,\nit makes sense what it's doing.\n\n321\n00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:50.230\nIf it's requesting,\n\n322\n00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:53.980\nwhat that means is when somebody attempts\nto make a connection my machine or\n\n323\n00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:57.420\nwhatever machine I'm enabling this\npolicy on is gonna say, whoa, hold up.\n\n324\n00:16:57.420 --> 00:17:00.850\nBefore you connect let's authenticate.\n\n325\n00:17:00.850 --> 00:17:04.750\nIf the other end says, sure let's\nauthenticate then we'll authenticate and\n\n326\n00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:07.050\ndetermine whether or\nnot to allow the connection.\n\n327\n00:17:07.050 --> 00:17:09.710\nIf the other end says,\nwhat do you mean authenticate?\n\n328\n00:17:09.710 --> 00:17:11.550\nI don't know what you're talking about.\n\n329\n00:17:11.550 --> 00:17:15.460\nWell, my machine's gonna say,\nit's okay, connect to me anyway.\n\n330\n00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:17.070\nIt was just a request, right?\n\n331\n00:17:17.070 --> 00:17:19.058\nI tried to get the other\nend to authenticate.\n\n332\n00:17:19.058 --> 00:17:21.459\nThey said they didn't understand,\nI'm gonna go ahead and\n\n333\n00:17:21.459 --> 00:17:24.460\nallow the connection even\nthough it's unauthenticated.\n\n334\n00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:29.495\nIf I choose require, now the machine I'm\nenabling this policy on is gonna say,\n\n335\n00:17:29.495 --> 00:17:32.130\nwow, before you connect,\nlet's authenticate.\n\n336\n00:17:32.130 --> 00:17:35.800\nIf the other end says, I don't understand\nwhat you mean by authenticate,\n\n337\n00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:37.740\nthen the server I'm setting\nthis policy on is gonna say,\n\n338\n00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:39.580\nthen you're not connecting to me, right?\n\n339\n00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:40.370\nIt's required,\n\n340\n00:17:40.370 --> 00:17:43.460\nif you can't authenticate, you're not\ngonna be allowed to make that connection.\n\n341\n00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:47.380\nSo I'm gonna say, request authentication\nfor inbound and outbound connections.\n\n342\n00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:49.720\nI'm gonna zoom out so\nI can see my buttons.\n\n343\n00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:55.020\nAnd for my authentication method,\nI've got the default, which is usually\n\n344\n00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:59.040\nauthentication method specified in IPsec,\nand we'll see that policy in a minute.\n\n345\n00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:01.550\nComputer end user using Kerberos V5.\n\n346\n00:18:01.550 --> 00:18:07.162\nAgain, works great, but only for\ndomain members, and then computer,\n\n347\n00:18:07.162 --> 00:18:12.040\nso not authenticating the user\nusing Kerberos V5 or advance.\n\n348\n00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:14.790\nAnd if I click Advance and\nthen click Customize\n\n349\n00:18:14.790 --> 00:18:18.530\nyou see I actually can set like first and\nsecond authentication methods.\n\n350\n00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:24.720\nWe're gonna stick with just doing computer\nauthentication and we'll go ahead and\n\n351\n00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:25.940\nclick Next.\n\n352\n00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:30.540\nAnd I'll apply this to all\nprofiles to make sure it kicks in.\n\n353\n00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:33.640\nWe'll click Next, and\nI'm gonna give it a name.\n\n354\n00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:37.238\nI'm gonna call this,\nI don't know, Request.\n\n355\n00:18:39.096 --> 00:18:42.320\nAuth, and we'll click Finish.\n\n356\n00:18:43.770 --> 00:18:46.700\nAnd for some reason the firewall likes\nto jump behind everything else when\n\n357\n00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:47.760\nI click Finish.\n\n358\n00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:48.860\nSo there it is, and\n\n359\n00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:53.220\nthere is our new connection security\nrule that I've put in place.\n\n360\n00:18:53.220 --> 00:18:58.100\nSo let's see if that changes anything\nfrom our other end from the outside.\n\n361\n00:18:58.100 --> 00:19:03.390\nSo I'm gonna go back over to my client and\nI'm gonna launch remote desktop.\n\n362\n00:19:03.390 --> 00:19:05.565\nAnd notice it still asks\nme to authenticate,\n\n363\n00:19:05.565 --> 00:19:08.439\nnot the same authentication\nthat we just said, all right?\n\n364\n00:19:08.439 --> 00:19:11.340\nI'll talk about that in a minute and\nI'm able to connect.\n\n365\n00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:15.740\nI'm gonna go and close that and\n\n366\n00:19:15.740 --> 00:19:18.990\nif I jump over to the home machine you\nwould see that nothing has changed.\n\n367\n00:19:18.990 --> 00:19:23.100\nAnd that's because, again,\nwe set it to request security.\n\n368\n00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:26.130\nIt tried to authenticate, but\nthe other end didn't know anything and\n\n369\n00:19:26.130 --> 00:19:27.920\nit allowed the connection anyway.\n\n370\n00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:33.620\nWe go back over to that server, and\nwe're gonna change it up a little bit.\n\n371\n00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:37.620\nAll right, so I'm gonna delete this one.\n\n372\n00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:41.380\nI could modify this one, but\nthen my name wouldn't make much sense so\n\n373\n00:19:41.380 --> 00:19:43.000\nI'm just gonna delete it.\n\n374\n00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:44.110\nAnd we'll do it again.\n\n375\n00:19:44.110 --> 00:19:47.180\nRight click &gt;New rule,\nwe're gonna do Isolation again.\n\n376\n00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:48.640\n&gt;&gt; Do it right or\ndon't do it at all, right?\n\n377\n00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:51.830\n&gt;&gt; That's right, and\nI'm gonna require for inbound, and\n\n378\n00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:54.140\nrequest authentication for outbound.\n\n379\n00:19:54.140 --> 00:19:59.414\nI'll click Next, we use computer Kerberos,\nI'll apply it to all profiles,\n\n380\n00:20:01.589 --> 00:20:06.680\nAnd I'll say RequireAuth,\nand we'll click Finish.\n\n381\n00:20:07.850 --> 00:20:10.160\nAnd now let's see what\nhappens when I go over to Mr.\n\n382\n00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:15.090\nClient and\nI fire up Remote Desktop to Server4.\n\n383\n00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:20.760\n&gt;&gt; Not able to even try to authenticate.\n\n384\n00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:23.600\n&gt;&gt; It's not looking good for\nthe home team, is it?\n\n385\n00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:27.920\nBecause what's happening is my laptop or\nmy virtual machine, is reaching out to\n\n386\n00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:32.442\nthat service saying, hey, I wanna\nconnect using remote desktop, port 3389.\n\n387\n00:20:32.442 --> 00:20:35.967\nThe firewall's saying, yeah,\nthat's allowed, but wait,\n\n388\n00:20:35.967 --> 00:20:40.490\nbefore I allow it I need to authenticate\nyou, to make sure I know who you are.\n\n389\n00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:43.260\nAnd we're gonna use Kerberos Version 5.\n\n390\n00:20:43.260 --> 00:20:48.530\nMy machine is saying,\nI don't have any authentication policies.\n\n391\n00:20:48.530 --> 00:20:51.610\nI don't know what you're talking\nabout with this authenticate.\n\n392\n00:20:51.610 --> 00:20:55.550\nAnd so it's not authenticating, and\nbecause the server is set to require\n\n393\n00:20:55.550 --> 00:20:57.968\nauthentication, then it's not\ngonna allow the connection, right?\n\n394\n00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:03.550\nSo now, I cannot connect to that server.\n\n395\n00:21:03.550 --> 00:21:07.284\nSo let's see if we can fix it,\non the client ends of things,\n\n396\n00:21:07.284 --> 00:21:09.691\nand notice I'm on client 3, right?\n\n397\n00:21:09.691 --> 00:21:14.720\nI'm gonna create a new rule and I'll call\nit Isolation, or I'll choose Isolation.\n\n398\n00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:15.360\nI'll click Next.\n\n399\n00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:18.480\nFor this one I'm gonna request\nauthentication for inbound and\n\n400\n00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:20.000\noutbound connections.\n\n401\n00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:25.000\nAnd what this mean s is now, if I\n\n402\n00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:29.130\ntry to make a connection to a machine, and\nthat machine says, whoa, wait a second,\n\n403\n00:21:29.130 --> 00:21:33.200\nlet's authenticate, my machine will now\nunderstand that authentication process.\n\n404\n00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:37.630\nI have a connection security rule\nthat will allow me to respond\n\n405\n00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:39.770\nto authentication requests, right?\n\n406\n00:21:39.770 --> 00:21:44.160\nSo I can now authenticate,\nI'll click Next, we'll use kerberos.\n\n407\n00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:48.033\nI'll click Next, Next, and I'll say,\n\n408\n00:21:50.007 --> 00:21:55.100\nIf I can spell, requestAuth for\nthis one, click Finish.\n\n409\n00:21:56.620 --> 00:22:00.895\nAnd now let's see if we can\nconnect to that other end.\n\n410\n00:22:00.895 --> 00:22:06.050\nServer4 and look at that,\nlike magic I'm in there.\n\n411\n00:22:06.050 --> 00:22:09.410\nBecause now when I reached out\nto that server it says, whoa,\n\n412\n00:22:09.410 --> 00:22:13.050\nbefore you make that connection,\nI require authentication.\n\n413\n00:22:13.050 --> 00:22:16.180\nMy machine responded with,\nI understand authentication,\n\n414\n00:22:16.180 --> 00:22:20.844\nhere is my authentication, and\nit's my computer that's authenticating.\n\n415\n00:22:20.844 --> 00:22:23.840\nAnd that's what I was trying to say\nearlier, I'm not talking about my username\n\n416\n00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:27.420\nand password that I'm entering,\nthat's not part of this equation.\n\n417\n00:22:27.420 --> 00:22:31.100\nBehind the scenes, before I get\nthat authentication dialog box for\n\n418\n00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:33.860\nmy user account,\nthe computers are connecting.\n\n419\n00:22:33.860 --> 00:22:35.790\nThey are authenticating each other.\n\n420\n00:22:35.790 --> 00:22:41.410\nI don't get my login dialogue box until\nthey're done establishing the connection.\n\n421\n00:22:41.410 --> 00:22:46.450\nSo that login dialog box has nothing to\ndo with what we're setting up, all right?\n\n422\n00:22:46.450 --> 00:22:47.940\nThat's part of Remote Desktop, and\n\n423\n00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:50.990\nmake sure I'm authorized to\nremote into that computer.\n\n424\n00:22:50.990 --> 00:22:53.380\nAnd what I was saying earlier was,\n\n425\n00:22:53.380 --> 00:22:56.730\nas soon as I see that\nauthentication dialog box pop up.\n\n426\n00:22:56.730 --> 00:22:59.090\nI know that the computers have already\nestablished their connection and\n\n427\n00:22:59.090 --> 00:23:00.390\nthey've done their thing.\n\n428\n00:23:00.390 --> 00:23:06.235\nSo I was saying I didn't have to go\nany further to actually connect.\n\n429\n00:23:06.235 --> 00:23:08.770\nAll right, so I'm gonna close that down,\nwhat about Mr.\n\n430\n00:23:08.770 --> 00:23:11.505\nHome machine over here,\nwhat do we think is going on with him.\n\n431\n00:23:11.505 --> 00:23:16.580\nLet's do Remote Desktop and\n\n432\n00:23:16.580 --> 00:23:21.990\nconnect, yeah, and we kind of assume that,\nor expected that, right?\n\n433\n00:23:21.990 --> 00:23:25.490\nBecause there is no\nauthentication policy on this guy.\n\n434\n00:23:25.490 --> 00:23:26.410\nSo let's change that.\n\n435\n00:23:26.410 --> 00:23:30.159\nLet's go into Firewall with\nAdvanced Security, and\n\n436\n00:23:30.159 --> 00:23:33.747\nlet's create a connection\nsecurity rule for him.\n\n437\n00:23:33.747 --> 00:23:37.810\nSo we're gonna go Isolation,\nwe'll click Next.\n\n438\n00:23:37.810 --> 00:23:41.140\nWe'll do requests just like I\ndid on the domain member client.\n\n439\n00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:45.441\nI'll use Kerberos, Next, Next and,\n\n440\n00:23:47.257 --> 00:23:52.235\nRequestAuth, And now I'll\n\n441\n00:23:52.235 --> 00:23:57.932\nconnect No, still no connection.\n\n442\n00:23:57.932 --> 00:23:58.450\n&gt;&gt; Hm.\n\n443\n00:23:58.450 --> 00:24:02.358\n&gt;&gt; What the heck is going on,\nhe's not a part of the domain, right?\n\n444\n00:24:02.358 --> 00:24:04.602\nSo I can't authenticate using kerberos,\n\n445\n00:24:04.602 --> 00:24:07.857\nI don't have an account in\nActive Directory for this home PC.\n\n446\n00:24:07.857 --> 00:24:12.393\nSo, even though I have a policy that says,\nnow I'm allowed to respond to those\n\n447\n00:24:12.393 --> 00:24:15.709\nconnection requests or\nconnection security requests.\n\n448\n00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:20.590\nI don't have the proper,\n&gt;&gt; Connection rules setup,\n\n449\n00:24:20.590 --> 00:24:22.790\nbecause you would need\nto use certificates.\n\n450\n00:24:22.790 --> 00:24:24.540\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nI don't have the proper authentication,\n\n451\n00:24:24.540 --> 00:24:29.450\nI'm not part of your domain and your\nauthentication method has excluded me.\n\n452\n00:24:29.450 --> 00:24:35.980\nSo, if I wanted to set it up so that\na home user or a vendor could remote in.\n\n453\n00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:39.220\nI'm gonna have to use certificates or\nsome other authentication method.\n\n454\n00:24:39.220 --> 00:24:40.350\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, make those exceptions.\n\n455\n00:24:40.350 --> 00:24:42.320\n&gt;&gt; Yes, exactly.\n\n456\n00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:46.828\nAll right, so\nthat takes care of that, now,\n\n457\n00:24:46.828 --> 00:24:54.080\nwhat I wanna do is let's go back over\nto our client actually, Cherokee.\n\n458\n00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:58.410\nYou gave me that high sign and\nwe're getting ready to get into IPsec.\n\n459\n00:24:58.410 --> 00:25:01.890\nLet me show you one more thing and\nthen you can cut me off.\n\n460\n00:25:01.890 --> 00:25:03.580\n&gt;&gt; Okay, are we gonna be coming\nback with a part three or?\n\n461\n00:25:03.580 --> 00:25:04.180\n&gt;&gt; We are.\n\n462\n00:25:04.180 --> 00:25:07.408\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; We are, so let me go to the client and\n\n463\n00:25:07.408 --> 00:25:10.537\nI'm gonna remote in to that server.\n\n464\n00:25:13.681 --> 00:25:18.677\nAnd I should be able to, because I have\na policy that allows me to authenticate,\n\n465\n00:25:18.677 --> 00:25:21.590\nand there we go, I'm into the server.\n\n466\n00:25:21.590 --> 00:25:25.910\nAnd now, while I'm in the server,\nlet's take a peek at a couple things,\n\n467\n00:25:25.910 --> 00:25:29.980\ngonna go down to\nMonitoring CConnection Security Rules,\n\n468\n00:25:29.980 --> 00:25:34.060\nI can see the current rule,\nthe rule that's active.\n\n469\n00:25:34.060 --> 00:25:35.730\nAnd again, this is on the server, right?\n\n470\n00:25:35.730 --> 00:25:38.390\nI'm remoted in to the server,\nyou can see that up here.\n\n471\n00:25:38.390 --> 00:25:42.890\nSo the server is requiring authentication\nfor all inbound traffic, and\n\n472\n00:25:42.890 --> 00:25:46.460\nis gonna be using Kerberos as\nit's authentication method.\n\n473\n00:25:46.460 --> 00:25:51.700\nDown below that, I've got my Security\nAssociation's Main Mode and Quick Mode.\n\n474\n00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:54.720\nAnd we haven't talked all about these yet,\nI will come back and\n\n475\n00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:56.490\ntalk about those when we hit IPsec.\n\n476\n00:25:56.490 --> 00:25:57.660\nWhat I want you to notice, though,\n\n477\n00:25:57.660 --> 00:26:02.380\nis that there is a connection established\nbetween that, the server, 104.\n\n478\n00:26:02.380 --> 00:26:05.590\nAnd the remote address, 55, right?\n\n479\n00:26:05.590 --> 00:26:09.926\nThat's the client connecting over to the\nserver, I can see they used kerberos to\n\n480\n00:26:09.926 --> 00:26:12.947\nmake that authentication,\nbut when we look over here.\n\n481\n00:26:15.144 --> 00:26:19.001\nThis is for the let me back out for\njust a second, this is my main mode and\n\n482\n00:26:19.001 --> 00:26:20.420\nactually, you know what?\n\n483\n00:26:20.420 --> 00:26:24.508\nI think I'm gonna hold off, I was gonna\ntalk a little bit about this, but\n\n484\n00:26:24.508 --> 00:26:26.669\nI don't think I've got enough time.\n\n485\n00:26:26.669 --> 00:26:29.580\nAnd I don't want to go really\nfast across this process-\n\n486\n00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:31.490\n&gt;&gt; So basically, we got a sneak peek.\n\n487\n00:26:31.490 --> 00:26:32.400\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you got a sneak peek,\n\n488\n00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:36.420\nbecause I wanna differentiate\nbetween main mode, and quick mode.\n\n489\n00:26:36.420 --> 00:26:38.230\nAnd what I wanna show you is how,\n\n490\n00:26:38.230 --> 00:26:42.830\nyou'll see that under Main Mode, it does\nsay there's some encryption going on.\n\n491\n00:26:42.830 --> 00:26:46.780\nBut when I look under Quick Mode,\nthere is no encryption, right?\n\n492\n00:26:46.780 --> 00:26:47.420\nThere is no,\n\n493\n00:26:47.420 --> 00:26:51.830\nif that's proper English, no encryption\nis being applied to that traffic.\n\n494\n00:26:51.830 --> 00:26:53.960\nAnd this goes back to\nwhat I said originally,\n\n495\n00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:57.040\nwhere these connection security rules,\ndon't secure the traffic.\n\n496\n00:26:57.040 --> 00:26:59.090\nThey secure the connection, right?\n\n497\n00:26:59.090 --> 00:27:02.160\nThey authenticate either end,\ndepending on how we set it up.\n\n498\n00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:04.540\nBut they're not doing anything\nto protect the traffic,\n\n499\n00:27:04.540 --> 00:27:07.200\nthe data, that's actually\ntraveling across the network.\n\n500\n00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:09.050\nAnd so\nthat's where we're gonna come back and\n\n501\n00:27:09.050 --> 00:27:12.090\ntake a look at how we\ncan tie IPsec into this.\n\n502\n00:27:12.090 --> 00:27:15.720\nAnd start adding a third layer\nof protection to that data.\n\n503\n00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:18.580\n&gt;&gt; Just like Shrek,\nhave you ever seen Shrek, Mike?\n\n504\n00:27:18.580 --> 00:27:20.370\n&gt;&gt; Once, the first one.\n\n505\n00:27:20.370 --> 00:27:22.260\n&gt;&gt; Ogres are like?\n\n506\n00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:23.550\n&gt;&gt; Green big things.\n\n507\n00:27:23.550 --> 00:27:24.750\n&gt;&gt; Onions!\n\n508\n00:27:24.750 --> 00:27:25.810\n&gt;&gt; That's right, they've got layers.\n\n509\n00:27:25.810 --> 00:27:26.510\n&gt;&gt; Lots of layers!\n\n510\n00:27:26.510 --> 00:27:27.575\n&gt;&gt; Lots of layers, there we go.\n\n511\n00:27:27.575 --> 00:27:28.075\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n512\n00:27:28.075 --> 00:27:30.235\n&gt;&gt; We've got lots of layers here, too, but\n\n513\n00:27:30.235 --> 00:27:33.705\nin order to see that third layer, you're\ngonna need to tune in, for this next show.\n\n514\n00:27:33.705 --> 00:27:34.205\nBut for now,\n\n515\n00:27:34.205 --> 00:27:36.510\nlet's sign out, I've been your host,\nCherokee Boose.\n\n516\n00:27:36.510 --> 00:27:37.270\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n517\n00:27:37.270 --> 00:27:38.805\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n518\n00:27:38.805 --> 00:27:45.513\n[MUSIC]\n\n519\n00:27:45.513 -->

[CROSSTALK].\n\n4\n00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:08.263\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.263 --> 00:00:11.700\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.480\n&gt;&gt; Welcome everyone to your\nConfiguring Windows Devices series for\n\n7\n00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.460\nthat 70-697 exam.\n\n8\n00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.141\nI'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n9\n00:00:19.141 --> 00:00:21.767\nIn this episode, part three,\nwe're gonna come back and\n\n10\n00:00:21.767 --> 00:00:24.120\nlook at how to configure network security.\n\n11\n00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.762\nAnd with us today back in the studios,\nwe have Mr. Mike Rodrick.\n\n12\n00:00:26.762 --> 00:00:28.150\nHow's it going, Mike?\n\n13\n00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:29.804\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic, Cherokee,\nthanks for having me back.\n\n14\n00:00:29.804 --> 00:00:32.320\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I wouldn't have it any other way,\nyou know that.\n\n15\n00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:33.460\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Especially since I left\nyou guys with a little bit of\n\n16\n00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:34.089\na cliffhanger there, right?\n\n17\n00:00:34.089 --> 00:00:37.828\nI have to finish talking about-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you gave us our sneak peek.\n\n18\n00:00:37.828 --> 00:00:38.458\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.\n\n19\n00:00:38.458 --> 00:00:42.364\nSo we saw where we could use\nconnection security rules to control\n\n20\n00:00:42.364 --> 00:00:45.150\nthe authentication between two endpoints.\n\n21\n00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:47.539\nWe could either request it,\nwe could require it.\n\n22\n00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:50.947\nAnd we saw how that worked\nwhere we're using Kerberos for\n\n23\n00:00:50.947 --> 00:00:55.850\nauthentication which limited to domain\nmembers from being able to participate.\n\n24\n00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:56.846\n&gt;&gt; The types of people who could join.\n\n25\n00:00:56.846 --> 00:00:59.970\n&gt;&gt; Yes, which is domain isolation.\n\n26\n00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:03.785\nSo when you start studying and you look up\nand you're talking about domain isolation,\n\n27\n00:01:03.785 --> 00:01:04.733\nthat's what we did.\n\n28\n00:01:04.733 --> 00:01:10.170\nJust by, and we would use, now, I should\nback up and let you guys know this, too.\n\n29\n00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.076\nI'm doing it on the client because\nI've only got one machine.\n\n30\n00:01:14.076 --> 00:01:18.900\nAll of this can also be done, and\ntypically is done, through group policy.\n\n31\n00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.585\nBecause I'm not gonna go to every\nsingle machine and right-click on\n\n32\n00:01:22.585 --> 00:01:26.787\nconnection security rules, new rule,\nisolate, and go through all of that.\n\n33\n00:01:26.787 --> 00:01:29.226\nI'm gonna use a group policy and\n\n34\n00:01:29.226 --> 00:01:33.690\nActive Directory to apply\nthat to all of my systems.\n\n35\n00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:37.793\nSo you can imagine, if I applied\na policy at the domain level and\n\n36\n00:01:37.793 --> 00:01:42.906\nused the domain computers as my group to\ndo security filtering on that policy,\n\n37\n00:01:42.906 --> 00:01:45.788\nthat would apply to\nevery device out there.\n\n38\n00:01:45.788 --> 00:01:48.635\nAnd it would mean every device\nwould have to authenticate it,\n\n39\n00:01:48.635 --> 00:01:51.630\nwould request authentication for\ninbound connections.\n\n40\n00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.931\nWhich means anybody that comes in is\nnot gonna be able to communicate with\n\n41\n00:01:54.931 --> 00:01:55.912\nany domain members.\n\n42\n00:01:55.912 --> 00:01:58.070\nNobody from the outside.\n\n43\n00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:59.855\nSo that you're isolating your domain.\n\n44\n00:01:59.855 --> 00:02:03.886\nAnd if you just took it a step further and\nyou went to a particular server and\n\n45\n00:02:03.886 --> 00:02:08.241\nyou applied a policy, or locally on that\nmachine, went through that process of\n\n46\n00:02:08.241 --> 00:02:11.558\nisolation, and then defining\nwho was allowed to connect and\n\n47\n00:02:11.558 --> 00:02:16.330\nwhat their authentication method was,\nyou're now doing server isolation.\n\n48\n00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:23.238\nAnd it's not uncommon, in fact, it's a\nbest practice, to see these used together.\n\n49\n00:02:23.238 --> 00:02:27.292\nIn our server classes, we'll talk about\nwhat they call zones of protection.\n\n50\n00:02:27.292 --> 00:02:32.524\nAnd you can really think of your\ndomain isolation as your overall zone.\n\n51\n00:02:32.524 --> 00:02:36.820\nThat includes everything,\nall of your domain components.\n\n52\n00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.901\nThen within that zone,\nyou'll have little server isolations.\n\n53\n00:02:39.901 --> 00:02:42.551\nYou might have a database back end, and\n\n54\n00:02:42.551 --> 00:02:47.691\nthe only things allowed to talk to that\nare the three web server front ends and\n\n55\n00:02:47.691 --> 00:02:52.530\nthe two admin computers that manage that,\nor a developer's machine.\n\n56\n00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.153\nAll right, so now you've isolated that\nserver and those five other machines.\n\n57\n00:02:56.153 --> 00:02:57.684\nAnd they can talk to each other,\n\n58\n00:02:57.684 --> 00:03:00.310\nbut nobody else can connect\nto that back-end server.\n\n59\n00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.966\nSo that would be server isolation.\n\n60\n00:03:02.966 --> 00:03:06.911\nAnd you might have more than one server\nisolation group within your network,\n\n61\n00:03:06.911 --> 00:03:08.680\ndepending on your requirements.\n\n62\n00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.968\nSo you can start seeing that\nwithin your domain isolation,\n\n63\n00:03:11.968 --> 00:03:16.504\nif you drew a big circle, within that you\nmight have a smaller circle representing\n\n64\n00:03:16.504 --> 00:03:18.762\na server isolation group\n&gt;&gt; Server, okay.\n\n65\n00:03:18.762 --> 00:03:19.655\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly, all right.\n\n66\n00:03:19.655 --> 00:03:25.370\nAnd so, yeah, I'm not sure why I went\ndown that road now, completely forgot.\n\n67\n00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:27.078\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you were just giving us\na little bit of extra information about\n\n68\n00:03:27.078 --> 00:03:27.585\nisolation, Mike.\n\n69\n00:03:27.585 --> 00:03:28.726\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's what it was.\n\n70\n00:03:28.726 --> 00:03:29.431\nI get so excited about this stuff.\n\n71\n00:03:29.431 --> 00:03:31.970\nI tell you,\nI lose track of where I'm going.\n\n72\n00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:34.198\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's okay,\nit's called geeking out for a reason.\n\n73\n00:03:34.198 --> 00:03:37.053\n&gt;&gt; Yes, all right.\nSo next thing we do want to look at,\n\n74\n00:03:37.053 --> 00:03:40.780\nthough, is taking a look\nat protecting that data.\n\n75\n00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.812\nAs we've said, the authentication is\ngoing to authenticate either end of\n\n76\n00:03:44.812 --> 00:03:48.078\nthe conversation, but\nit does nothing to protect the data.\n\n77\n00:03:48.078 --> 00:03:52.498\nIPsec is Internet Protocol security,\nand this is what we are going to apply.\n\n78\n00:03:52.498 --> 00:03:54.574\nI was talking about policies,\nthat's what it was.\n\n79\n00:03:54.574 --> 00:03:57.667\nAll of a sudden it popped back in\nmy head because we were saying that\n\n80\n00:03:57.667 --> 00:04:00.210\nnormally-\n&gt;&gt; You said the group policy versus\n\n81\n00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:02.251\nthe individual configuration.\n\n82\n00:04:02.251 --> 00:04:04.507\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, normally you'd be doing this-\n&gt;&gt; Working smarter, not harder,\n\n83\n00:04:04.507 --> 00:04:05.340\nkind of deal.\n&gt;&gt; Exactly,\n\n84\n00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:10.141\nI'm going to apply this at the domain\nlevel, or maybe I do this at an OU or\n\n85\n00:04:10.141 --> 00:04:13.680\nI use security filtering\nto limit who it applies to.\n\n86\n00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:14.880\nAnd I'll probably have\nmore than one policy.\n\n87\n00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:19.210\nOne for domain isolation, another one for\nthat particular server isolation,\n\n88\n00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:20.985\netc., etc.\n\n89\n00:04:20.985 --> 00:04:24.273\nAll right, so now,\nback to the matter at hand.\n\n90\n00:04:24.273 --> 00:04:26.922\nIPsec allows me to encrypt the data or\n\n91\n00:04:26.922 --> 00:04:31.685\nto protect that data as it's\ntraveling across the network.\n\n92\n00:04:31.685 --> 00:04:38.060\nAnd for that, we're gonna use our\nfirewall rules to apply the encryption.\n\n93\n00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:41.465\nSo I wanna go back and take a look, just\nfor a second, let me see where I'm at.\n\n94\n00:04:41.465 --> 00:04:42.978\nYeah, let's go over to server.\n\n95\n00:04:42.978 --> 00:04:45.700\nAnd let's log in for a second.\n\n96\n00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:49.798\nI did disconnect my remote desktop\nsession from the previous part, so\n\n97\n00:04:49.798 --> 00:04:53.627\nthis will actually go away as soon\nas I refresh some of this stuff.\n\n98\n00:04:56.982 --> 00:04:59.566\nYeah, let's get rid of that.\n\n99\n00:04:59.566 --> 00:05:04.730\nI say, that's an interesting,\nlet me pull that firewall back up.\n\n100\n00:05:07.701 --> 00:05:10.510\nMy computers are just not\nplaying along nicely.\n\n101\n00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:14.557\nGo back into Monitoring, and\nlet's see if those guys are still there.\n\n102\n00:05:14.557 --> 00:05:17.589\nKinda wanted to get them to flush out\nbefore I started talking, but hey,\n\n103\n00:05:17.589 --> 00:05:20.600\nwe'll still have something\nto point at while we talk.\n\n104\n00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:24.866\nSo when we talk about security\nassociations, or SAs, security\n\n105\n00:05:24.866 --> 00:05:30.560\nassociations are negotiations that occur\nas we're establishing that connection.\n\n106\n00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:35.790\nWe do that connection security rule,\nwe authenticate, we create what's\n\n107\n00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:41.366\nknown as SAs, or security associations,\none for inbound, one for outbound.\n\n108\n00:05:41.366 --> 00:05:43.867\nThere are main mode associations, and\n\n109\n00:05:43.867 --> 00:05:46.834\nthere are quick mode\nsecurity associations.\n\n110\n00:05:46.834 --> 00:05:49.860\nMain mode is where we\ndo the authentication.\n\n111\n00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:52.848\nSo this is part of\nthe connection security rule, or\n\n112\n00:05:52.848 --> 00:05:57.166\nthis is what happens because we've\ndefined a connection security rule.\n\n113\n00:05:57.166 --> 00:06:01.240\nThe server is saying, wait, before you\nconnect to me, you need to authenticate.\n\n114\n00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:04.830\nThe other end is then passing back and\nforth the authentication information.\n\n115\n00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:08.593\nThey're deciding on what keys they're\ngonna use if they're gonna do any\n\n116\n00:06:08.593 --> 00:06:12.330\nencryption, or if they're going\nto provide any integrity checks.\n\n117\n00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:15.930\nThey're negotiating all that,\ntrying to find what they have in common so\n\n118\n00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:18.205\nthat they can start\nprotecting that traffic.\n\n119\n00:06:18.205 --> 00:06:23.180\nAnd that's what happens in main mode, is\nall that information gets swapped back and\n\n120\n00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:27.800\nforth and they establish the identity\nof either end of the connection.\n\n121\n00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:32.370\nAnd if they're gonna do encryption, this\nis where they'll start preparing the keys\n\n122\n00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:35.556\nthat they're gonna be using to\ndo that encryption as well.\n\n123\n00:06:35.556 --> 00:06:39.183\nAnd then the quick mode is where\nthey create the final keys that\n\n124\n00:06:39.183 --> 00:06:43.371\nare actually going to do the encryption\nand establish what protocols,\n\n125\n00:06:43.371 --> 00:06:47.940\nwhat encryption algorithms, they're\ngonna be using for that encryption.\n\n126\n00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:54.391\nNotice my quick mode is already gone,\nbut the main mode is still here.\n\n127\n00:06:54.391 --> 00:06:57.885\nMain mode,\nonce you create that security association,\n\n128\n00:06:57.885 --> 00:07:00.590\nhas a much longer\nlifetime than quick mode.\n\n129\n00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:01.459\nSorry, and let me zoom in.\n\n130\n00:07:01.459 --> 00:07:03.500\nThere's not really\nanything to look at here.\n\n131\n00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:05.606\n&gt;&gt; So\nhow much longer are we talking about?\n\n132\n00:07:05.606 --> 00:07:09.680\n&gt;&gt; The quick mode is,\nput me on the spot here.\n\n133\n00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:12.030\nI wanna say it's-\n&gt;&gt; Just take a guess.\n\n134\n00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:15.159\n&gt;&gt; So many minutes, ten minutes,\nsomething like that.\n\n135\n00:07:15.159 --> 00:07:18.314\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Whereas the main mode is typically,\n\n136\n00:07:18.314 --> 00:07:21.180\nI think, by default, eight hours.\n\n137\n00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:23.679\nI am not positive on that,\nI'll have to double-check on that.\n\n138\n00:07:23.679 --> 00:07:26.929\nAnd I don't expect them to test you\non anything quite that detailed, but\n\n139\n00:07:26.929 --> 00:07:27.934\nit is good to know.\n\n140\n00:07:27.934 --> 00:07:30.923\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, just kind of like days or-\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and it is,\n\n141\n00:07:30.923 --> 00:07:34.500\nI think a workday is what they use,\nI think it's eight hours.\n\n142\n00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:35.846\nI might be a little off on that.\n\n143\n00:07:35.846 --> 00:07:40.383\nAnd the way this works is, the main\nmode takes a little bit of the time.\n\n144\n00:07:40.383 --> 00:07:44.606\nThis is when I'm doing the authentication,\nwe're agreeing on the different protocols\n\n145\n00:07:44.606 --> 00:07:48.110\nwe're gonna use, we're establishing\nthose early keys and all of that.\n\n146\n00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:51.017\nOnce I've established that,\nlet's say I'm the client and\n\n147\n00:07:51.017 --> 00:07:53.050\nyou guys out there are the server.\n\n148\n00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:57.182\nOnce we do that negotiation, I can\nkinda put that aside and hold on to it.\n\n149\n00:07:57.182 --> 00:08:01.318\nThen we're gonna do a quick mode, \\we're\ngonna start sending data back and forth,\n\n150\n00:08:01.318 --> 00:08:04.823\nso we're gonna do another security\nassociation to set up The process for\n\n151\n00:08:04.823 --> 00:08:07.370\nactually transferring the data and\nencrypting it.\n\n152\n00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:11.665\nAnd once we're done talking, right,\nonce I'm done sending data back and\n\n153\n00:08:11.665 --> 00:08:14.040\nforth the quick mode will time out.\n\n154\n00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:16.394\nAs you see it's only been,\nI know you guys don't know,\n\n155\n00:08:16.394 --> 00:08:19.210\nbut we just finished the last episode,\nwe just started this episode,\n\n156\n00:08:19.210 --> 00:08:23.330\nit's been less than 10 minutes I think\nbetween that and it's already gone.\n\n157\n00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:27.063\nBut the main mode is still there and\nthat's because once I'm done sending you\n\n158\n00:08:27.063 --> 00:08:29.317\ndata, right,\nthe quick mode gets torn down.\n\n159\n00:08:29.317 --> 00:08:33.570\nBut if I need to send data to you again,\nI don't have to go through that main mode,\n\n160\n00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:37.577\nright, the main mode is still there\nwe've already established who we are,\n\n161\n00:08:37.577 --> 00:08:40.106\nwe've already proven to\neach other who we are.\n\n162\n00:08:40.106 --> 00:08:44.359\nSo, I can just quickly set up a quick\nmode, no pun intended, association and\n\n163\n00:08:44.359 --> 00:08:47.893\nstart sending data again, right,\nso it speeds up the process,\n\n164\n00:08:47.893 --> 00:08:52.500\nit reduces the amount of overhead in\nestablishing the secured connections.\n\n165\n00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:57.530\nSo main mode gets brought up and it stays,\nquick mode will fade very quickly as\n\n166\n00:08:57.530 --> 00:09:00.820\nsoon as you stop sending data, but\nit can be brought back up again\n\n167\n00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:05.540\nwithout having to go through the whole\nmain-mode security association.\n\n168\n00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:09.150\nAll right, and that was what I was\nstarting to get into in that previous\n\n169\n00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:13.300\nepisode because I wanted to show you,\nwe set up a connections security rule\n\n170\n00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:15.550\nwe didn't set up anything to\ndo with encryption, right.\n\n171\n00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:20.550\nAll we did was say we're gonna require\nauthentication using Kerberos, so\n\n172\n00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:24.750\nwhen we look, I can see Kerberos V5\non this main mode association.\n\n173\n00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:30.450\nI see Encryption, AES-CBC 128, and\nfor Integrity, for my digital signing,\n\n174\n00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:35.570\nmy hashes, SHA-1, right, but\nthis is not encrypting the data.\n\n175\n00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:39.430\nI want us to be real careful with that\nthis is really just the encryption for\n\n176\n00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:41.630\nthat main mode association.\n\n177\n00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:44.890\nAll that information we're sending back\nand forth to authenticate each other,\n\n178\n00:09:44.890 --> 00:09:48.870\nthe keys we're generating,\nthat is protected using AES-CBC 128.\n\n179\n00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:52.820\nThat quick mode, which is gone now,\n\n180\n00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:57.930\nhad no encryption listed here because\nwe didn't define any encryption,\n\n181\n00:09:57.930 --> 00:10:01.140\nthat is going to be done\nthrough our firewall rules.\n\n182\n00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:04.860\nSo, let's re-establish what we've got so\nfar, I've got a connection security rule\n\n183\n00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:09.510\nthat says I'm gonna require\nauthentication for anything coming in\n\n184\n00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:13.220\nacross, did we say it was for\nremote desktop, or did we just say any?\n\n185\n00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:18.470\nI think we just left it wide open,\nright, yep, so we're just going to,\n\n186\n00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:23.720\nwe're requiring authentication for\nany connections to server four.\n\n187\n00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:29.130\nIf I go back over to client three and\nwe take a look, right,\n\n188\n00:10:29.130 --> 00:10:33.530\nhe's requesting authentication which means\nhe supports the authentication process and\n\n189\n00:10:33.530 --> 00:10:37.052\nif we remote in I should\nbe able to connect.\n\n190\n00:10:37.052 --> 00:10:43.355\nAll right, so I'm connected no problem,\nI'm going to disconnect and\n\n191\n00:10:43.355 --> 00:10:49.039\nnow if I come back over to server four,\nright, and I log back in.\n\n192\n00:10:52.435 --> 00:10:55.959\nWe'll see that my main mode is still\nthere that hadn't changed, but\n\n193\n00:10:55.959 --> 00:11:00.040\nnotice a new quick mode was established\nfor this particular session.\n\n194\n00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:02.950\nBut I did not have to go through the main\nmode association again, because that\n\n195\n00:11:02.950 --> 00:11:07.950\nwas already present, and you can also see\nthat there is no encryption being applied.\n\n196\n00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:12.340\nAll right, so if I want to encrypt it,\nwhat do I do?\n\n197\n00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:16.470\nWe haven't seen any options to encrypt yet\non the connection security rules or\n\n198\n00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:17.870\nanywhere we have looked.\n\n199\n00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:22.730\nThat is actually done on the firewall\nrules so I'm gonna go over to\n\n200\n00:11:22.730 --> 00:11:27.980\nInbound Rules and I'm gonna find\nmy remote desktop firewall rules.\n\n201\n00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:32.990\nSo this one right here, TCP In,\nis the one that I'm using to connect\n\n202\n00:11:32.990 --> 00:11:37.910\nfrom client to Server 04,\ndown towards the bottom of this,\n\n203\n00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:40.990\nGeneral, you can see it says,\nAllow the connection, right.\n\n204\n00:11:40.990 --> 00:11:44.710\nWe saw this in our previous part I said\nwe were going to skip the secure stuff\n\n205\n00:11:44.710 --> 00:11:47.380\nuntil we got to it well now we're here.\n\n206\n00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:48.970\nSo, I'm going to choose\nthe option this time,\n\n207\n00:11:48.970 --> 00:11:54.740\nAllow the connection if it is secure, all\nright and then I'm gonna click Customize.\n\n208\n00:11:56.630 --> 00:11:59.740\nI'll zoom out so we can see this whole\nthing actually it might be easier if I\n\n209\n00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:01.870\njust zoom in and\nkind of scroll up and down.\n\n210\n00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:05.620\nSo the first option there, Allow\nthe connection if it is authenticated and\n\n211\n00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:07.710\nintegrity protected,\n\n212\n00:12:07.710 --> 00:12:11.030\nwell that is what we're doing with\nour connection security rule.\n\n213\n00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:16.580\nWe're authenticating using Kerberos V5 and\nby default it's using SHA-1 for\n\n214\n00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:21.290\nintegrity, right,\nto digitally sign those packets.\n\n215\n00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:25.150\nBut no encryption, right, this doesn't\nsay anything about protecting the data.\n\n216\n00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:29.205\nAs we go down,\nRequire the connections to be encrypted,\n\n217\n00:12:29.205 --> 00:12:34.320\nRequire privacy in addition to\nintegrity and authentication and that's\n\n218\n00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:37.990\nan important option there, or an important\nword to pay attention to, in addition.\n\n219\n00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:41.420\nThat means what's set up\nhere is still gonna apply,\n\n220\n00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:45.090\nas well as now requiring encryption.\n\n221\n00:12:45.090 --> 00:12:48.740\nSo we choose that one now\nwe're gonna start encrypting\n\n222\n00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:52.240\nthe traffic as well as\nauthenticating the connection.\n\n223\n00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:58.010\nYou can also see, Allow the computers\nto dynamically negotiate encryption.\n\n224\n00:12:58.010 --> 00:13:01.250\nWhat this means is,\nthat either end of this connection\n\n225\n00:13:01.250 --> 00:13:04.480\nwe can have different encryption\nprotocols being allowed, and\n\n226\n00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:07.210\nwhen they make that security association,\nthey're gonna\n\n227\n00:13:07.210 --> 00:13:10.790\nnegotiate the strongest encryption\nmethod that they both understand.\n\n228\n00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:15.700\nThey'll start at the top of their list and\nsay, hey, I know this, I know AES512,\n\n229\n00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:16.980\ndo you?\n\n230\n00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:18.400\nNo, I don't.\n\n231\n00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:20.250\nOkay, well what about AES256?\n\n232\n00:13:20.250 --> 00:13:21.255\nNo.\nWhat about AES128?\n\n233\n00:13:21.255 --> 00:13:23.270\nOoh, that one I know.\n\n234\n00:13:23.270 --> 00:13:24.450\nAnd they can start using that, so\n\n235\n00:13:24.450 --> 00:13:28.310\nthey'll negotiate that strongest method,\nall right.\n\n236\n00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:30.990\nAnd you can see,\nThis option allows authenticated but\n\n237\n00:13:30.990 --> 00:13:35.330\nunencrypted network packets to be sent\nwhile encryption is being negotiated.\n\n238\n00:13:37.010 --> 00:13:39.480\nI've read a couple of\ndifferent things on this and\n\n239\n00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:43.930\nthis is It's something that you might have\nto experiment with to see if you need it.\n\n240\n00:13:43.930 --> 00:13:47.760\nIt can cause problems if you\nrequire the encryption, but\n\n241\n00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:52.450\nyou don't allow them to do that\nnegotiation unencrypted because\n\n242\n00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:56.310\nthey might not have anything in\ncommon that they can use and\n\n243\n00:13:56.310 --> 00:14:00.290\nso this is something that'll\nhelp fix some of those issues.\n\n244\n00:14:00.290 --> 00:14:03.420\nTo require the connections\nto be encrypted below that,\n\n245\n00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:06.480\nAllow the connection to\nuse null encapsulation.\n\n246\n00:14:07.930 --> 00:14:12.470\nThis is where you can authenticate it,\nbut does not provide integrity or\n\n247\n00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:14.550\nprivacy protection for the packet payload.\n\n248\n00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:16.640\nCompatible with Windows 7 and later.\n\n249\n00:14:18.030 --> 00:14:20.790\nThis one's an interesting one cuz again,\nyou're gonna authenticate it, but\n\n250\n00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:23.140\nyou're gonna provide no integrity and\n\n251\n00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:25.730\nyou're gonna provide null\nencryption at this point.\n\n252\n00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:30.280\nFrom what I've read off of Microsoft's\nsite, cuz I had to go and research this,\n\n253\n00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:32.740\nwhy would I wanna use null encapsulation?\n\n254\n00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:40.040\nAnd they say it had to do a lot with\nif you're trying to do interpretation\n\n255\n00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:43.210\nof the data or you're trying to capture\ndata and then read that data out.\n\n256\n00:14:43.210 --> 00:14:46.480\nObviously if there's encryption implied\nyou're not gonna be able to read\n\n257\n00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:50.930\nthat data, yeah, that one I don't\nknow when I would use that one.\n\n258\n00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:51.830\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n259\n00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:55.000\n&gt;&gt; And then,\nOverride block rules, Useful for\n\n260\n00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:59.610\ntools that must always be available,\nsuch as remote administration tools.\n\n261\n00:14:59.610 --> 00:15:02.440\nIf we specify that, we also have to\nspecify the authorized computer or\n\n262\n00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:09.810\ncomputer group that is going to be allowed\nto ignore the encryption requests.\n\n263\n00:15:09.810 --> 00:15:11.090\nAll right, so I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n264\n00:15:11.090 --> 00:15:14.270\nleave it on, Require the connection to\nbe encrypted, and I'm gonna click OK.\n\n265\n00:15:14.270 --> 00:15:19.291\nAnd then I'll click OK and\nthat's all I did, what you'll notice\n\n266\n00:15:19.291 --> 00:15:24.220\nnow is there's a little lock next\nto my firewall exception for,\n\n267\n00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:30.268\nRemote Desktop TCP-In, that means we\nare enforcing encryption on that guy.\n\n268\n00:15:30.268 --> 00:15:35.334\nSo now, I'm gonna go over to the client\nand we're gonna remote in again.\n\n269\n00:15:40.541 --> 00:15:43.758\nAnd everything seems the same,\nright, one, I'm allowed, right,\n\n270\n00:15:43.758 --> 00:15:47.640\nI was able authenticate so it's allowing\nme to establish the connection.\n\n271\n00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:50.922\nNow it's asking me for my credentials to\nprove that I'm allowed to remote desktop\n\n272\n00:15:50.922 --> 00:15:53.000\nin and I've established by connection.\n\n273\n00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.844\nSo just like before, it doesn't\nseem like anything's different but\n\n274\n00:15:55.844 --> 00:15:59.131\nif we take a look, and again, I'm on\nServer 4, right, I'm remoted in there.\n\n275\n00:15:59.131 --> 00:16:03.750\nI've got my main mode association\nbetween the client and the server,\n\n276\n00:16:03.750 --> 00:16:09.304\nagain using Kerberos Version 5, But if I\ntake a look at Quick Mode, now we're gonna\n\n277\n00:16:09.304 --> 00:16:14.810\nsee that I have the original Quick Mode\nfrom that first remote desktop connection.\n\n278\n00:16:14.810 --> 00:16:16.624\nThat one hasn't timed out yet.\n\n279\n00:16:16.624 --> 00:16:18.590\nI wonder if I refresh my screen.\n\n280\n00:16:18.590 --> 00:16:19.590\nNope, still hasn't timed out.\n\n281\n00:16:19.590 --> 00:16:20.552\nThat one will go away in a minute.\n\n282\n00:16:20.552 --> 00:16:23.880\nBut the one right above\nthat is my current one.\n\n283\n00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:26.580\nAnd again, same source and\ndestination address.\n\n284\n00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:27.430\nBut look over here.\n\n285\n00:16:28.450 --> 00:16:31.330\nESP Encryption is turned on.\n\n286\n00:16:31.330 --> 00:16:34.200\n&gt;&gt; Okay, Mike, now that we've configured\nour security connection rule,\n\n287\n00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:38.630\nis there any instance or\nsituation where I may want to go ahead and\n\n288\n00:16:38.630 --> 00:16:42.170\nallow a particular connection\neven without the authentication?\n\n289\n00:16:42.170 --> 00:16:43.760\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, that's a great question.\n\n290\n00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:46.010\nAnd you're gonna have some\ndevices on your network or\n\n291\n00:16:46.010 --> 00:16:48.550\npossibly have some\ndevices in your network.\n\n292\n00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:52.290\nThat need to connect to maybe that\nserver but don't support IPsec or\n\n293\n00:16:52.290 --> 00:16:54.200\ndon't understand that process right?\n\n294\n00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:55.990\nNot a Windows 10 machine obviously but\n\n295\n00:16:55.990 --> 00:17:00.900\nmaybe some kind of inter-networking\ndevice or something like that that\n\n296\n00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:04.990\nneeds to connect or a phablet, who knows\nwhat people are using now to connect.\n\n297\n00:17:04.990 --> 00:17:07.870\nSo let's take a look at\nhow we can set that up.\n\n298\n00:17:07.870 --> 00:17:11.510\nReally what we're talking about\nIs creating an authentication\n\n299\n00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:12.770\nexception, right?\n\n300\n00:17:12.770 --> 00:17:17.070\nWe're gonna require authentication,\nexcept for this device over here,\n\n301\n00:17:17.070 --> 00:17:21.240\nwe're gonna allow that to connect\neven without any authentication.\n\n302\n00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:23.360\nAll right, so to set this up,\n\n303\n00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:26.780\nI am gonna go back to our\nremote desktop firewall rule.\n\n304\n00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:29.330\nStill using that as our demo rule.\n\n305\n00:17:29.330 --> 00:17:32.570\nBut I'm gonna remove the requirement for\nencryption.\n\n306\n00:17:32.570 --> 00:17:37.240\nMainly because if we're not gonna\nauthenticate, we're gonna be able to\n\n307\n00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:42.470\nfocus on just the authentication part for\nthis demo, all right.\n\n308\n00:17:42.470 --> 00:17:46.720\nSo again, connection security rule,\nrequire authentication from everybody, for\n\n309\n00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:48.150\ninbound on the server.\n\n310\n00:17:48.150 --> 00:17:51.290\nThe client request authentication.\n\n311\n00:17:51.290 --> 00:17:55.785\nSo right now I should be able\nto remote into server three and\n\n312\n00:17:55.785 --> 00:17:58.820\nserver four with no problem, right?\n\n313\n00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:00.660\nThere's my authentication dialog box.\n\n314\n00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:03.430\nI put my password in,\nwe would connect just fine.\n\n315\n00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:08.960\nIt wouldn't be encrypted but\nthe connection is authenticated All right,\n\n316\n00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:11.440\nso let's see if we can make an exception.\n\n317\n00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:12.690\nIf I remove this rule.\n\n318\n00:18:15.436 --> 00:18:20.003\nSo now the server is requiring\nauthentication but the client is set up to\n\n319\n00:18:20.003 --> 00:18:26.250\nnot do authentication, or it's a device\nthat doesn't understand authentication.\n\n320\n00:18:26.250 --> 00:18:29.639\nIf I try to connect now, we're kind of\nright back into the boat we were at\n\n321\n00:18:29.639 --> 00:18:31.402\nthe beginning of our first episode.\n\n322\n00:18:31.402 --> 00:18:35.770\nIt's not gonna work, because they\ncan't agree on this authentication.\n\n323\n00:18:35.770 --> 00:18:37.560\nOne's saying, I have to have it.\n\n324\n00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:41.030\nThe other one's saying,\nI know not what you're talking about.\n\n325\n00:18:41.030 --> 00:18:42.060\nSo we're going to cancel that out, and\n\n326\n00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:45.720\nwe're going to see if we can\nmake an exception for client 3.\n\n327\n00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:52.040\nSo back over to Server 4, and we're\ngonna just create a new security rule.\n\n328\n00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:53.290\nRight-click New Rule.\n\n329\n00:18:54.850 --> 00:19:01.480\nAnd this one is going to be, I'll zoom in\nhere, an authentication exemption rule.\n\n330\n00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:05.610\nDo not authenticate connections\nfrom the specified computers.\n\n331\n00:19:05.610 --> 00:19:11.218\nSo I'll click Next on my rule, I'll click\nAdd, and we're gonna add our IP address.\n\n332\n00:19:11.218 --> 00:19:15.369\n10.10.8.55 and\nthat's the IP address of client 03 or\n\n333\n00:19:15.369 --> 00:19:18.640\nour device that doesn't\nsupport authentication.\n\n334\n00:19:19.670 --> 00:19:24.020\nWe'll click Next, I'll apply it to\nall profiles, I'll give it a name.\n\n335\n00:19:25.930 --> 00:19:31.150\nSay ExemptCL03 or something like that,\nwe'll click Finish.\n\n336\n00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:36.050\nAnd so now we have an additional\nrule that should exempt\n\n337\n00:19:36.050 --> 00:19:39.080\nthis IP address from\nhaving to authenticate.\n\n338\n00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:42.620\nEven though server is setup to\nrequire inbound authentication for\n\n339\n00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:44.740\nall connections.\n\n340\n00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:45.570\nLet's see if it works.\n\n341\n00:19:45.570 --> 00:19:49.220\nWe'll go back over to client three and\nget no rule over here, right?\n\n342\n00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:53.290\nWe'll go for\nour Remote Desktop Connection.\n\n343\n00:19:53.290 --> 00:19:56.380\nServer 4 and look at there.\n\n344\n00:19:56.380 --> 00:19:58.710\nI've got my log in dialog box and\n\n345\n00:19:58.710 --> 00:20:02.260\nI will be able to make that\nconnection over to server 4.\n\n346\n00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:07.670\nEven though my client is not set\nup to support with an occasion and\n\n347\n00:20:07.670 --> 00:20:09.540\nthat's because of that exemption rules.\n\n348\n00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:13.050\nSo that's how we use\nthose to allow devices or\n\n349\n00:20:13.050 --> 00:20:18.040\nnodes that don't support IP seg To still\nconnect to a server that's requiring that.\n\n350\n00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:22.980\n&gt;&gt; Without compromising the overall\nsecurity of my network by just allowing\n\n351\n00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:25.910\neveryone to connect with that\nauthentication so it was pretty cool Mike.\n\n352\n00:20:25.910 --> 00:20:27.714\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, cuz that would solve\nthe problem too, right,\n\n353\n00:20:27.714 --> 00:20:29.732\nif we just turned off the requirement for\nidentification.\n\n354\n00:20:29.732 --> 00:20:33.110\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It would but I mean you\nmight be creating additional problems.\n\n355\n00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:34.300\n&gt;&gt; Most likely, right?\n\n356\n00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:39.310\nThis way we can say specifically who's\nallowed to connect without Authentication,\n\n357\n00:20:39.310 --> 00:20:41.440\nmuch more secure solution.\n\n358\n00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:43.320\nAll right, last thing I wanna talk about,\n\n359\n00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:45.870\nthey happen to throw this\ninto the network objectives.\n\n360\n00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:48.720\nIs gonna be configuring network discovery.\n\n361\n00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:50.134\nI'm not really sure, but\n\n362\n00:20:50.134 --> 00:20:54.389\nI guess in a way this is security through\nobscurity if I don't turn it on maybe?\n\n363\n00:20:54.389 --> 00:20:58.229\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\ncuz it's not like you don't exist, but\n\n364\n00:20:58.229 --> 00:21:00.970\nI guess\n&gt;&gt; Okay, you know how it goes.\n\n365\n00:21:00.970 --> 00:21:03.400\nSo anyway, it will cover since\nit is in its objectives.\n\n366\n00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:04.120\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n367\n00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:07.940\nclose my out of remote desktop connection,\nthat will close all of our windows.\n\n368\n00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:11.640\nSo I'm back here on my Windows\n10 client domain member.\n\n369\n00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:16.560\nI'm gonna open up file explorer and\nI'm gonna click on Network.\n\n370\n00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:19.570\nAnd what we'll going to get is a crazy\nlittle message that says network discovery\n\n371\n00:21:19.570 --> 00:21:21.030\nis turned off.\n\n372\n00:21:21.030 --> 00:21:23.050\nNetwork computers and\ndevices are not visible.\n\n373\n00:21:23.050 --> 00:21:28.450\nPlease turn on network discovery\nin the Network and Sharing Center.\n\n374\n00:21:28.450 --> 00:21:33.390\nAnd what this is, so\nnetwork discovery is what allows you to\n\n375\n00:21:33.390 --> 00:21:37.700\nbe seen on the network and\nallow other nodes to see.\n\n376\n00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:39.530\nWait, did I say that right or\ndid I say that twice?\n\n377\n00:21:39.530 --> 00:21:43.217\nSo it allows you to be seen by other nodes\nand it allows you to see other nodes.\n\n378\n00:21:43.217 --> 00:21:43.801\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n379\n00:21:43.801 --> 00:21:44.770\n&gt;&gt; Does that make sense?\n\n380\n00:21:44.770 --> 00:21:47.210\n&gt;&gt; It does make sense to me but\nI know what network discovery is.\n\n381\n00:21:47.210 --> 00:21:51.680\nFor someone who doesn't know what that\nmeans, it's like hey Mike, I have some\n\n382\n00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:56.020\npictures from last night when we all hung\nout and I want to share them with you.\n\n383\n00:21:56.020 --> 00:21:58.810\nI have saved them here\nin the shared folder and\n\n384\n00:21:58.810 --> 00:22:03.040\nyou try to look at my pictures over\nthe network but you can't actually get\n\n385\n00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:06.850\nthere because you don't see that folder\nthat I shared out and things like that.\n\n386\n00:22:06.850 --> 00:22:11.320\nSo if we disable that, you were\nkind of alluding to by saying hey,\n\n387\n00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:15.710\nthis isn't really a security but\nmaybe perhaps obscuring the presence here.\n\n388\n00:22:15.710 --> 00:22:21.580\nBecause if I prevent you from seeing that,\nthere are tools\n\n389\n00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:27.250\nthat will still allow an attacker to\nsee to see that information exist.\n\n390\n00:22:27.250 --> 00:22:32.369\nBut you're really kind of just keeping the\nhonest people honest if that makes sense.\n\n391\n00:22:32.369 --> 00:22:33.359\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we could do with that.\n\n392\n00:22:33.359 --> 00:22:36.193\n&gt;&gt; A long way about it though.\n\n393\n00:22:36.193 --> 00:22:40.210\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly, right.\n\n394\n00:22:40.210 --> 00:22:45.410\nNetwork discovery is\ncan I see from my node,\n\n395\n00:22:45.410 --> 00:22:48.700\ncan I see the other nodes on my\nnetwork that have shares, right?\n\n396\n00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:51.490\nThat are making things\navailable to the network.\n\n397\n00:22:51.490 --> 00:22:53.610\nAnd if I've got shares,\n\n398\n00:22:53.610 --> 00:22:57.120\nthings I want to make available\nto the network can they see me?\n\n399\n00:22:57.120 --> 00:22:59.760\nThere's only one option that\ncontrols both of those.\n\n400\n00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:02.250\nNetwork discovery is turned off.\n\n401\n00:23:02.250 --> 00:23:05.940\nI won't see any of those file shares\non those other nodes on my network.\n\n402\n00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:07.960\nThey won't see any of my shares, right?\n\n403\n00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:10.210\nIt's like I'm hidden from the network.\n\n404\n00:23:10.210 --> 00:23:11.450\nI turn network discovery on,\n\n405\n00:23:11.450 --> 00:23:15.150\nI'll be able to see all those\nshares out there on those servers.\n\n406\n00:23:15.150 --> 00:23:19.840\nBut they'll also be able to see my\nshares that I've created, right?\n\n407\n00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:20.990\nSo let's see where we can turn it off.\n\n408\n00:23:20.990 --> 00:23:23.688\nAs you can see here in File Explorer,\n\n409\n00:23:23.688 --> 00:23:27.439\nI get a little yellow bar\nthat says click to change.\n\n410\n00:23:27.439 --> 00:23:28.940\nI don't know if you guys can read that.\n\n411\n00:23:28.940 --> 00:23:30.150\nNetwork discovery is turned off.\n\n412\n00:23:30.150 --> 00:23:32.160\nThis happened when I clicked on network.\n\n413\n00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:36.055\nNetwork computers and\ndevices are not visible, click to change.\n\n414\n00:23:36.055 --> 00:23:39.780\nIf I click that,\nI get a little drop-down list here.\n\n415\n00:23:39.780 --> 00:23:44.510\nTurn on network discovery, so I could turn\nit on from right here and be done with it.\n\n416\n00:23:44.510 --> 00:23:48.280\nWouldn't teach you guys where to go and\nhow to turn it on in an exam environment.\n\n417\n00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:49.680\nSo I'm not gonna do that.\n\n418\n00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:52.770\nI'm gonna open up my network and\nsharing center.\n\n419\n00:23:52.770 --> 00:23:56.599\nEverybody, you guys should know at this\npoint you can always get there by going\n\n420\n00:23:56.599 --> 00:23:57.654\ninto your settings.\n\n421\n00:23:57.654 --> 00:24:01.210\nYou can right-click down here,\nNetwork and internet,\n\n422\n00:24:01.210 --> 00:24:03.812\nany way you wanna get to your networking.\n\n423\n00:24:03.812 --> 00:24:07.195\nAnd then Sharing options, and\n\n424\n00:24:07.195 --> 00:24:12.940\nhere is where we've got\nour network discovery.\n\n425\n00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:15.640\nAnd notice this is another\none of those things, and\n\n426\n00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:17.250\nthis is an important exemptive.\n\n427\n00:24:18.310 --> 00:24:23.020\nI go to private, it also have\nthe options for network discovery here.\n\n428\n00:24:23.020 --> 00:24:27.950\nIf I go to guest republic,\nI have network discovery here as well.\n\n429\n00:24:27.950 --> 00:24:31.020\nSo this is a profile dependent setting.\n\n430\n00:24:31.020 --> 00:24:34.940\nIn other words, I can allow network\ndiscovery when I'm at work, but\n\n431\n00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:37.550\nnot when I'm out there at the coffee shop.\n\n432\n00:24:37.550 --> 00:24:39.410\nBut I wanna allow it when I'm at home.\n\n433\n00:24:39.410 --> 00:24:41.580\nSo you can do it on a per profile basis.\n\n434\n00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:46.750\nAnd you simply turn it on, turn on\nnetwork discovery and click Save Changes.\n\n435\n00:24:48.110 --> 00:24:49.965\n&gt;&gt; That's because you wanna\nsee those pictures, don't you?\n\n436\n00:24:49.965 --> 00:24:50.831\n&gt;&gt; It is, I really wanna see this.\n\n437\n00:24:50.831 --> 00:24:53.397\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Cuz I have no memory of the whole\n\n438\n00:24:53.397 --> 00:24:54.430\nevening.\n\n439\n00:24:54.430 --> 00:24:57.120\nSo let me refresh this guy.\n\n440\n00:24:57.120 --> 00:24:59.570\nGet off that screen, go back to Network.\n\n441\n00:24:59.570 --> 00:25:03.836\nAnd now, I'm gonna see things\non the network start popping up,\n\n442\n00:25:03.836 --> 00:25:06.526\nI don't know if anybody has any shares.\n\n443\n00:25:06.526 --> 00:25:08.616\nLet's I'm remoted in still?\n\n444\n00:25:08.616 --> 00:25:12.940\nNever mind, no I'm not.\n\n445\n00:25:12.940 --> 00:25:14.130\nI just locked it when I remoted in.\n\n446\n00:25:14.130 --> 00:25:19.690\nGonna say, let me go make a share real\nquick and I can show you, get logged in.\n\n447\n00:25:21.370 --> 00:25:27.110\nOpen up File Explorer, and let's take\na look at making a share real quick.\n\n448\n00:25:29.236 --> 00:25:32.600\nAnd no I'm not following best practices,\nas far as security goes.\n\n449\n00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:35.290\nI'm just gonna share this with everyone,\nusing a simple\n\n450\n00:25:35.290 --> 00:25:38.055\nwizard knowing that it's gonna take\ncare of my NTFS permissions as well.\n\n451\n00:25:38.055 --> 00:25:42.810\n[COUGH] Flip back over to the client,\nand let's see here.\n\n452\n00:25:42.810 --> 00:25:50.024\nWe'll jump to this PC, jump back in\nnetwork and it might take it a minute.\n\n453\n00:25:50.024 --> 00:25:53.440\nBut I should actually see,\nin fact if I come up here and go to svr4/.\n\n454\n00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:57.740\n&gt;&gt; You're just navigating\nstraight to that machine.\n\n455\n00:25:57.740 --> 00:26:00.240\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\nAnd there I can see some of these shares.\n\n456\n00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:04.420\nSometimes once you connect to it,\nusually it'll pop up here.\n\n457\n00:26:04.420 --> 00:26:06.290\nBut it'll do some discovery in a minute.\n\n458\n00:26:06.290 --> 00:26:08.170\nIt'll start showing these guys.\n\n459\n00:26:08.170 --> 00:26:12.130\nAlthough I might have network\ndiscovery turned off on this guy.\n\n460\n00:26:12.130 --> 00:26:13.390\n&gt;&gt; That's a good point though Mike,\n\n461\n00:26:13.390 --> 00:26:17.270\ncuz you do have to have it enabled\non both of those endpoints there.\n\n462\n00:26:17.270 --> 00:26:18.250\n&gt;&gt; I do, right?\n\n463\n00:26:18.250 --> 00:26:19.020\nSo let's check.\n\n464\n00:26:19.020 --> 00:26:22.130\nSo I'm on the server, and\nI'm gonna change advanced.\n\n465\n00:26:22.130 --> 00:26:23.070\nI did that a little quick.\n\n466\n00:26:23.070 --> 00:26:23.910\nI'm on the server.\n\n467\n00:26:23.910 --> 00:26:26.340\nI went back into my Network and\nSharing Center.\n\n468\n00:26:26.340 --> 00:26:27.840\nThe options are a little different here.\n\n469\n00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:31.220\nIt's change advanced sharing settings, and\n\n470\n00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:35.500\nthen turn on network discovery and\nSave Changes.\n\n471\n00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:36.850\nAnd I'll close that.\n\n472\n00:26:36.850 --> 00:26:39.200\nNow, if I go back over to the client.\n\n473\n00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:41.990\nI'll just close File Explorer\nto get this guy to refresh.\n\n474\n00:26:41.990 --> 00:26:42.980\nWe'll go to Network.\n\n475\n00:26:44.486 --> 00:26:47.610\nAnd yeah, it's probably gonna be\na minute or two before that pops up.\n\n476\n00:26:47.610 --> 00:26:49.050\nBut that's the idea,\n\n477\n00:26:49.050 --> 00:26:52.450\nis with network discovery,\nI don't have to know the exact name.\n\n478\n00:26:52.450 --> 00:26:56.320\nI'll see all those resources that\nare available on my network.\n\n479\n00:26:56.320 --> 00:27:00.340\nAnd I can simply browse to them,\njust like I would any other folder.\n\n480\n00:27:00.340 --> 00:27:03.180\nNetwork discovery turned off,\nthat doesn't work.\n\n481\n00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:05.190\nI can still share things,\nand keep that in mind.\n\n482\n00:27:05.190 --> 00:27:10.080\nIt's not that you're preventing sharing,\nby turning off or on network discovery.\n\n483\n00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:11.330\n&gt;&gt; It just makes it easier.\n\n484\n00:27:11.330 --> 00:27:14.130\n&gt;&gt; Yes, you're turning on\nthe browser service, right?\n\n485\n00:27:14.130 --> 00:27:17.681\nThe one that reaches out and finds all\nthose shares, and makes them visible here.\n\n486\n00:27:17.681 --> 00:27:21.710\nYou're controlling whether that is\nallowed to see your computer or not.\n\n487\n00:27:21.710 --> 00:27:25.684\nAnd so that is the network discovery.\n\n488\n00:27:25.684 --> 00:27:29.941\n&gt;&gt; All right Mike, so we have made it to\nthe end of our three part journey here.\n\n489\n00:27:29.941 --> 00:27:30.924\n&gt;&gt; [SOUND]\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for that, and\n\n490\n00:27:30.924 --> 00:27:34.200\nthank you for joining us as well,\nbut for now we're gonna sign out.\n\n491\n00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:35.630\nI've been your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n492\n00:27:35.630 --> 00:27:36.450\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n493\n00:27:36.450 --> 00:27:38.470\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n494\n00:27:38.470

00:00:13.104\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n&gt;&gt; Welcome everyone to your configuring\n\n4\n00:00:13.104 --> 00:00:17.111\nWindows devices series,\nstudying up for that 70-697 exam.\n\n5\n00:00:17.111 --> 00:00:19.440\nI'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:20.280\nAnd in this episode,\n\n7\n00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:24.030\nwe'll be taking a look at how we\ncan configure shared resources.\n\n8\n00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:25.570\nAnd of course, you know it, we have Mr.\n\n9\n00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:28.030\nMike Roderick back in\nstudios with us today.\n\n10\n00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:29.830\nHow's it going today, Mike?\n&gt;&gt; It's going great, Cherokee.\n\n11\n00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:33.140\nThanks for having me back, and\nI am excited to be sharing information\n\n12\n00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.640\nwith you guys out there about how to\nshare resources on a Windows network.\n\n13\n00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:37.680\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's what it's all about,\n\n14\n00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.580\nright?\n&gt;&gt; It is, it is, it is.\n\n15\n00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:42.880\nAll right, so we got a lot to talk\nabout when it comes to sharing.\n\n16\n00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.600\nWhen we look at our networks today,\n\n17\n00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.010\nobviously shares a very\nimportant part of it.\n\n18\n00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.720\nMy laptop doesn't do me any good if I\ncan't access those corporate resources\n\n19\n00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.600\nthat are up on that file server,\n\n20\n00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.530\nthose shared resources that\nare made available to the network.\n\n21\n00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.470\nOr maybe Cherokee has something that she\nwant to make available to a co-worker, and\n\n22\n00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:01.400\nshe needs to be able to share that out.\n\n23\n00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:02.860\nSo that's what we're gonna look at today.\n\n24\n00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.060\nHow do we work with shares?\n\n25\n00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.360\nAnd let's start by kind of defining what\nwe mean by a shared resource, right?\n\n26\n00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.400\nIf I have a folder on my computer here,\nI go to my hard drive and\n\n27\n00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.220\nmake a new folder, put some files\nin there, that's a local resource.\n\n28\n00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.956\nThat's on my machine that I can access\nanytime I log in to my machine.\n\n29\n00:01:23.956 --> 00:01:27.150\nA shared resource is when I take\nthat local folder, whatever,\n\n30\n00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.680\nsome resource I wanna make available\nto other people on the network, right?\n\n31\n00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.900\nRather then copy it to a thumb drive and\n\n32\n00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.330\nthen hand Cherokee a thumb drive,\nI can simply share that folder out.\n\n33\n00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.550\nAnd now, Cherokee can go across\nthe network over to my machine\n\n34\n00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:45.070\nand access those resources.\n&gt;&gt; So, you're essentially just making\n\n35\n00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.150\nour collaboration easier.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n36\n00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:51.160\nyou're making it available to everybody\nelse, or whomever, and we can control it\n\n37\n00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.850\nobviously, but you're making\nthe resource available to the network.\n\n38\n00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.270\nThat's what sharing is all about,\nis taking a local resource and\n\n39\n00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:59.230\nmaking it available.\n\n40\n00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:02.800\nWhether that's from my laptop, and\nI wanna make it available to coworkers or\n\n41\n00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:03.670\nwhomever.\n\n42\n00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.330\nOr it's a file server where I'm supposed\nto store all my documents because I know\n\n43\n00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.960\nmy company backs up that\nfile server every night.\n\n44\n00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:15.340\nSo they've made a share, and\nI can map a drive to it maybe and\n\n45\n00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:16.630\nstore files up there, right?\n\n46\n00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.500\nSame concept just sharing that out.\n\n47\n00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.060\nNow, we can share folders,\nwe can't share files.\n\n48\n00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.590\nAnd let me explain that cuz you might\nthink well, I need the file [LAUGH] I\n\n49\n00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.820\ndon't want the folder,\nI want the files that are in there.\n\n50\n00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:33.960\nWhen you share something to the network,\nyou share it at the folder level.\n\n51\n00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.740\nBut that's gonna make everything\ninside that folder available.\n\n52\n00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:41.220\nSo you cannot, and\nthis is an easy test question, right?\n\n53\n00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.410\nYou cannot share files,\ntechnically, right?\n\n54\n00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:49.330\nYou share folders, and then the resources\ninside those folders become available,\n\n55\n00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.110\nwhether they're files, more folders with\nfiles inside there, what have you, but\n\n56\n00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:54.630\nyou only share folders.\n\n57\n00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.620\nYou can't right- lick on a file and\nchoose to share it.\n\n58\n00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.650\nYou go to the parent folder and\nyou share that, all right?\n\n59\n00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.100\nAnd when we make these available and\nwe do choose to create these shares,\n\n60\n00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.990\nwe can then control who\nhas access to them.\n\n61\n00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:11.550\nDo you want everybody to be\nable to connect to them or\n\n62\n00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:13.810\njust certain individuals?\n\n63\n00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.126\nWe're going to learn about NTFS\npermissions coming up, right?\n\n64\n00:03:18.126 --> 00:03:23.010\nIn future episodes we'll talk about\nthose file system permissions.\n\n65\n00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.940\nHere, we're gonna be focusing just on\nshares, creating those shares, and\n\n66\n00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:28.750\nshare permissions.\n\n67\n00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.640\nAll right, so in order to create a share,\nyou need administrative access\n\n68\n00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.950\non the machine, which means many people\nwon't be able to create shares, all right?\n\n69\n00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:41.840\nCuz we don't typically make our\nend users administrators, or\n\n70\n00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.520\nat least not in this day and\nage, we try to avoid that.\n\n71\n00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:49.600\nWe've learned our lessons from all the bad\nthings that can happen when we do that.\n\n72\n00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.520\n&gt;&gt; Right, if you guys have taken like\n\n73\n00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:57.163\nComp TSA Plus, or whatever, and they\ntalk about different types of role-based\n\n74\n00:03:57.163 --> 00:04:01.690\nmodels, then we know that having that\ndiscretionary model isn't always the best\n\n75\n00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:05.460\nfor certain situations because\nend users may not understand\n\n76\n00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:08.140\nwhat your company's security policy is,\nto adhere to that.\n\n77\n00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:13.590\nSo looking at these types of shares\ncan help just enforce whatever\n\n78\n00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.640\npolicy you've decided on.\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n79\n00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:19.360\nNow, when it comes to sharing,\nwe're gonna talk about a few\n\n80\n00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:22.620\ndifferent ways that we can go about\ncreating these shared resources.\n\n81\n00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.730\nAgain, you do have to be\nan administrator on the machine.\n\n82\n00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:28.600\nYou don't have to be a domain admin or\nanything like that, but the machine that\n\n83\n00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:33.780\nyou're creating the share on, you're\ngonna need those administrative rights.\n\n84\n00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:36.250\nAll right, let's see, so\nwhat else do we want to talk about?\n\n85\n00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:38.990\nSharing is not enabled by default.\n\n86\n00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:43.120\nWe will go in, we'll take a look\nat how we can enable this.\n\n87\n00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.350\nNow, there are, as I said,\n\n88\n00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:48.880\na few different ways we can go\nabout creating those shares.\n\n89\n00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.660\nThere's also a few different,\ntrying to think of a way to say this,\n\n90\n00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:55.760\na few different types of shares\nthat we can work with as well.\n\n91\n00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.790\nWe've got something known\nas public folder sharing.\n\n92\n00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:04.110\nWe have our basic sharing, or\nwhat they call any folder sharing.\n\n93\n00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:07.820\nAnd in the any folder sharing, we've\ngot basic, and then we've got advanced.\n\n94\n00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:10.440\nSo we've got a few different\nways we can go about this.\n\n95\n00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:11.900\n&gt;&gt; It seems like they really gave us a lot\n\n96\n00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:15.290\nof different options when it comes\nto sharing our our information here.\n\n97\n00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:16.925\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, and we can do it through\n\n98\n00:05:16.925 --> 00:05:20.477\nthe GUI, we can do it through a command\nprompt, we can do it though PowerShell.\n\n99\n00:05:20.477 --> 00:05:22.310\nSo a lot of different\nways we can go about it.\n\n100\n00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:23.365\n&gt;&gt; And you're gonna show us all those\n\n101\n00:05:23.365 --> 00:05:26.040\ndifferent ways, right Mike?\n&gt;&gt; I think so, I think we'll have time\n\n102\n00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:28.020\nto get through all of those.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n103\n00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:28.646\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n104\n00:05:28.646 --> 00:05:31.111\nlet's start off talking\nabout public folder sharing.\n\n105\n00:05:31.111 --> 00:05:35.180\nThis is one that a lot of\npeople don't use that often.\n\n106\n00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:39.180\nAnd it's been around for\nquite some time, but public folders,\n\n107\n00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:42.300\nyou might have seen this, like back in\nthe day, if you've been in computers for\n\n108\n00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:46.600\nany length of time, back in like XP,\nmaybe even Windows 7,\n\n109\n00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:51.390\nthey used to show up in\nFile Explorer in my navigation tree.\n\n110\n00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:53.370\nThey're still there,\nbut they don't show up.\n\n111\n00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:55.530\nWe now have libraries and\nthings like that.\n\n112\n00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:56.610\nBut let me show you what I mean.\n\n113\n00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:00.020\nIf we take a look at my screen here,\nand I'm just on my Windows 10 machine.\n\n114\n00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:02.180\nThis is a domain member.\n\n115\n00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:04.800\nI'm logged on as an administrator.\n\n116\n00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:07.530\nAnd I'm gonna navigate\nover to my C: drive.\n\n117\n00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:09.838\nSo let me expand this out.\n\n118\n00:06:10.997 --> 00:06:13.540\nMake everything a little bigger for us.\n\n119\n00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:16.500\nAnd I'll zoom in as soon as\nI get where we need to go.\n\n120\n00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:17.730\nSo I'm gonna go to my C: drive.\n\n121\n00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:21.360\nAnd in there, I'm gonna go to Users.\n\n122\n00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:25.220\nAnd inside Users, you're gonna see\na folder called Public, right?\n\n123\n00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:27.840\nHere's all the people that\nhave logged onto this machine.\n\n124\n00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:29.580\nAubri, Cherokee, Titus.\n\n125\n00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:31.420\nThese are profiles for the users, right?\n\n126\n00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:32.550\nC: Users.\n\n127\n00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:34.980\nBut there's one called Public in here.\n\n128\n00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:39.530\nAnd if I open that up, inside there,\nI see public documents, public downloads,\n\n129\n00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:43.250\npublic music, public pictures,\nand public videos.\n\n130\n00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:46.030\nThe way these are set up, or\nwhat these are for, are for\n\n131\n00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:50.710\nsharing information amongst people\nthat can log in to this machine.\n\n132\n00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:53.640\nSo public in this respect means\n\n133\n00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:58.030\nanybody that has an account on this\nmachine can access these folders.\n\n134\n00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:00.540\nSo if this is a shared machine,\nif this is a,\n\n135\n00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:05.200\nwe don't see this as much nowadays-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and I'm trying to think,\n\n136\n00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:07.700\nI actually worked in an environment\nwhere it was utilized, and\n\n137\n00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:10.120\nit was with shift work on\na manufacturing floor.\n\n138\n00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:13.400\nSo as one shift were leaving,\nthey would still have that\n\n139\n00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:16.530\ncomputer on the manufacturing floor\nas the people rotated through.\n\n140\n00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:17.050\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\n\n141\n00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:21.650\nif you're in a place like that or any\nplace where you do hot desks, or the hot\n\n142\n00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:26.750\nswapping of desks where you can sit at\nany desk, or shift work is a big one.\n\n143\n00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:28.320\nMaybe the night crew comes in and\n\n144\n00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:31.520\nsits at computers that\nthe day shift was occupying.\n\n145\n00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:34.430\nSo if you wanted to share something\nwith somebody else that has access to\n\n146\n00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:39.170\nthe machine, you can simply drop it\nright into one of these folders.\n\n147\n00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:42.180\nFor example,\nI can go into public documents, and\n\n148\n00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:45.590\nlet me make up a new text document.\n\n149\n00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:49.700\nAnd I'll call this one,\nI don't know, draft.\n\n150\n00:07:50.890 --> 00:07:53.133\nMaybe I want somebody else\nto help me with this.\n\n151\n00:07:53.133 --> 00:07:58.392\nSo I've created this document,\nI've put it in public documents.\n\n152\n00:07:58.392 --> 00:08:01.695\nAnd now, I'm going to log out.\n\n153\n00:08:01.695 --> 00:08:06.663\nAnd I will get signed out her.\n\n154\n00:08:06.663 --> 00:08:10.791\nI'm gonna sign back in as Cherokee.\n\n155\n00:08:10.791 --> 00:08:12.286\nMs. Cherokee was kind enough\nto share her password.\n\n156\n00:08:12.286 --> 00:08:13.215\n&gt;&gt; How do you know my password?\n\n157\n00:08:13.215 --> 00:08:14.351\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n158\n00:08:14.351 --> 00:08:18.308\nI've got this little snipping\ntool that I've been using, no.\n\n159\n00:08:18.308 --> 00:08:19.784\nSo here I am, logged in as Cherokee.\n\n160\n00:08:19.784 --> 00:08:25.810\nWe're gonna go into File Explorer and\nnavigate into C-colon,\n\n161\n00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:31.958\nUsers, Public, Documents, and\nthere's that draft, right?\n\n162\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:33.714\nSo, Cherokee could open this up.\n\n163\n00:08:33.714 --> 00:08:35.627\nAnd so, she has read access, right?\n\n164\n00:08:35.627 --> 00:08:37.073\nCuz she's able to get to this document.\n\n165\n00:08:37.073 --> 00:08:44.498\nLet's see if she has Write access,\nlooks good, so far.\n\n166\n00:08:44.498 --> 00:08:45.056\nEven though,\n\n167\n00:08:45.056 --> 00:08:46.620\nI haven't done anything in my draft.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n168\n00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:47.259\n&gt;&gt; She's like, yeah,\n\n169\n00:08:47.259 --> 00:08:48.115\nthat's typical Mike work.\n\n170\n00:08:48.115 --> 00:08:51.197\nIt's a blank document, and\nyou think, you got something done.\n\n171\n00:08:51.197 --> 00:08:55.130\nSo, she goes to save it, and\nsure enough, she can save it,\n\n172\n00:08:55.130 --> 00:09:00.993\nif I log off,- And\nlog back in as well, as anybody.\n\n173\n00:09:00.993 --> 00:09:05.844\nBut I'll switch back over to Mike.\n\n174\n00:09:05.844 --> 00:09:09.150\nAnd my super secret password,\nwhich happens to be the same as\n\n175\n00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:10.692\nsuper secret password.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n176\n00:09:10.692 --> 00:09:14.014\n&gt;&gt; And I go back into file explorer and\n\n177\n00:09:14.014 --> 00:09:17.680\nI navigate over to C-colon, Users,\n\n178\n00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:22.508\nPublic Public Documents,\nthere's that draft.\n\n179\n00:09:22.508 --> 00:09:25.770\nIf I open it up,\nI can see what Cherokee has typed.\n\n180\n00:09:25.770 --> 00:09:30.897\nSo, that's an example of how these\npublic folders work by default.\n\n181\n00:09:30.897 --> 00:09:34.511\nAnybody that can connect to or\ncan log in to this machine,\n\n182\n00:09:34.511 --> 00:09:36.482\nhas access to public folders.\n\n183\n00:09:36.482 --> 00:09:38.208\nAnd let me show you why.\n\n184\n00:09:38.208 --> 00:09:42.475\nI always think understanding why,\ncan help you remember this kinda thing.\n\n185\n00:09:42.475 --> 00:09:45.728\nI wanna go down to Public Documents.\n\n186\n00:09:45.728 --> 00:09:50.185\nAnd I'm gonna pull up the properties for\nPublic Documents.\n\n187\n00:09:50.185 --> 00:09:54.510\nAnd I'm gonna go over to the security tab,\nand there's a group listed here.\n\n188\n00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:57.485\nNow, we have not talked\nabout NTFS permissions yet.\n\n189\n00:09:57.485 --> 00:09:59.937\nDepending on if you're watching\nthese episodes in order.\n\n190\n00:09:59.937 --> 00:10:02.046\nSo, I'm gonna kind of gloss\nover this a little bit.\n\n191\n00:10:02.046 --> 00:10:05.978\nIt might not make much sense to you yet,\nbut it will, as we progress.\n\n192\n00:10:05.978 --> 00:10:09.189\nBut, what I'm looking at,\nis the access control list.\n\n193\n00:10:09.189 --> 00:10:13.814\nThis is where I can control who can or\ncan't access this particular resource.\n\n194\n00:10:13.814 --> 00:10:17.097\nIn this case, Public Documents,\ncuz that's what I right-clicked on, and\n\n195\n00:10:17.097 --> 00:10:17.962\nchose Properties.\n\n196\n00:10:17.962 --> 00:10:22.183\nAnd when I look at this Security tab,\nI see a group called INTERACTIVE.\n\n197\n00:10:22.183 --> 00:10:26.857\nAnd I can see that they have modify\npermissions, which is basically read and\n\n198\n00:10:26.857 --> 00:10:29.568\nwrite and the ability to delete documents.\n\n199\n00:10:29.568 --> 00:10:32.034\nINTERACTIVE is a special group in Windows,\n\n200\n00:10:32.034 --> 00:10:35.312\nthat you're automatically a part\nof as soon as you log on.\n\n201\n00:10:35.312 --> 00:10:38.183\nIf you're sitting at the keyboard and\nlogging in,\n\n202\n00:10:38.183 --> 00:10:41.005\nyou are interacting\ndirectly with this machine.\n\n203\n00:10:41.005 --> 00:10:43.112\nYou become part of the INTERACTIVE group.\n\n204\n00:10:43.112 --> 00:10:46.029\nAnd so, that way,\nthey don't have to know, right?\n\n205\n00:10:46.029 --> 00:10:50.089\nIn here, you don't see Cherokee,\nor Wes, or Titus, or\n\n206\n00:10:50.089 --> 00:10:52.636\nAubrey, it's just INTERACTIVE.\n\n207\n00:10:52.636 --> 00:10:55.997\nAnd that covers everybody\nthat logs into this machine.\n\n208\n00:10:55.997 --> 00:10:58.878\nEven somebody that's\nnever logged in before.\n\n209\n00:10:58.878 --> 00:11:00.661\nAs soon as they log into this machine,\n\n210\n00:11:00.661 --> 00:11:02.793\nthey are now part of\nthat interactive group.\n\n211\n00:11:02.793 --> 00:11:05.755\nAnd they would have access to\nthe Public Folders, all right?\n\n212\n00:11:05.755 --> 00:11:06.914\nAnd that's why,\n\n213\n00:11:06.914 --> 00:11:11.251\nbecause of this INTERACTIVE group\nhaving modified permissions.\n\n214\n00:11:11.251 --> 00:11:14.190\nAll right, now, I'm gonna throw us all for\na little bit of a loop here, Cherokee.\n\n215\n00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:19.163\nAnd I'm gonna tell you guys, that Public\nFolder sharing on this machine is actually\n\n216\n00:11:19.163 --> 00:11:21.790\nturned off.\n&gt;&gt; Good to know.\n\n217\n00:11:21.790 --> 00:11:22.770\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, wait, what?\n\n218\n00:11:22.770 --> 00:11:23.349\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n219\n00:11:23.349 --> 00:11:24.483\n&gt;&gt; So if it's turned off,\n\n220\n00:11:24.483 --> 00:11:26.771\nwhy is all of this working, right?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n221\n00:11:26.771 --> 00:11:28.462\n&gt;&gt; And that's because,\n\n222\n00:11:28.462 --> 00:11:32.476\nwith Public Folder sharing turned off,\nby default.\n\n223\n00:11:32.476 --> 00:11:36.726\nAnybody that can log into this machine,\nhas access to Public Folders.\n\n224\n00:11:36.726 --> 00:11:41.318\nWhen I turn Public Folder sharing on,\nnow, all of a sudden, anybody that has\n\n225\n00:11:41.318 --> 00:11:45.506\naccess to the network, can get\naccess to the Public Folders, right?\n\n226\n00:11:45.506 --> 00:11:46.639\nDoes that make sense?\n\n227\n00:11:46.639 --> 00:11:49.013\nSo, with Public Folder sharing turned off,\n\n228\n00:11:49.013 --> 00:11:52.954\npeople that can log on to this machine\nhave access to these Public Folders.\n\n229\n00:11:52.954 --> 00:11:55.026\nWith Public Folder sharing turned on,\n\n230\n00:11:55.026 --> 00:11:59.304\nanybody that can connect to this machine\nvia the network, can now access those.\n\n231\n00:11:59.304 --> 00:12:02.982\nAnd let me show you how to turn it on.\n\n232\n00:12:02.982 --> 00:12:06.587\nSo I'm gonna, come over here\nto my several different ways.\n\n233\n00:12:06.587 --> 00:12:08.843\nObviously, that you can\nget to these screens.\n\n234\n00:12:08.843 --> 00:12:11.239\nI right clicked on my little network icon.\n\n235\n00:12:11.239 --> 00:12:16.066\nAnd so that I can come in here,\nclick on Ethernet and\n\n236\n00:12:16.066 --> 00:12:19.897\nthen change advanced sharing options.\n\n237\n00:12:19.897 --> 00:12:25.304\nBut you could also go through your Control\nPanel and navigate directly here, as well.\n\n238\n00:12:25.304 --> 00:12:30.021\nAnd right here, not under one of\nthe profiles, not Private, Public, or\n\n239\n00:12:30.021 --> 00:12:33.460\nDomain, but down here,\nwhere it says All Networks.\n\n240\n00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:36.486\nThere's an option for\nPublic Folder sharing.\n\n241\n00:12:36.486 --> 00:12:40.011\nAnd you can see that it says Turn Off,\nand that's what is selected.\n\n242\n00:12:40.011 --> 00:12:41.935\nTurn off Public Folder sharing.\n\n243\n00:12:41.935 --> 00:12:45.173\nPeople logged into the computer\ncan still access these folders.\n\n244\n00:12:45.173 --> 00:12:46.229\nThat is the default.\n\n245\n00:12:46.229 --> 00:12:49.327\nSo, if I wanna share between anybody\nthat can log in this machine.\n\n246\n00:12:49.327 --> 00:12:52.752\nLike shift work, like you were saying\nCherokee, I don't have to do anything.\n\n247\n00:12:52.752 --> 00:12:54.980\nAll I have to do is put\ndocuments in there,\n\n248\n00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:57.348\neverybody has access to it automatically.\n\n249\n00:12:57.348 --> 00:13:01.485\nIf I want those folders to\nbe available to the network.\n\n250\n00:13:01.485 --> 00:13:06.450\nThen I'm gonna turn on sharing, so\nthat anyone with access to the network\n\n251\n00:13:06.450 --> 00:13:10.471\ncan read and write files in\nthe Public Folders, all right?\n\n252\n00:13:10.471 --> 00:13:13.600\nSo I'm gonna zoom back out, and\nthen we'll go ahead and, actually,\n\n253\n00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:14.937\nbefore I save those changes.\n\n254\n00:13:14.937 --> 00:13:18.302\nLet's cancel that, and let's see\nwhat's it like before I turn it on.\n\n255\n00:13:18.302 --> 00:13:23.354\nSo, we go to Client two, and\nwe'll open up File Explorer.\n\n256\n00:13:23.354 --> 00:13:27.506\nAnd I'm gonna try to navigate\nback over to Client One.\n\n257\n00:13:27.506 --> 00:13:33.431\nSo Client 01, and it's gonna whirl and\ngrind here for a second.\n\n258\n00:13:33.431 --> 00:13:36.480\nAnd it's not gonna give me a whole lot,\n\n259\n00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:41.005\nit should actually give me a failure.\n&gt;&gt; So what you're doing, Mike,\n\n260\n00:13:41.005 --> 00:13:43.831\nis you're simulating network\naccess from another PC.\n\n261\n00:13:43.831 --> 00:13:47.612\nTrying to go ahead and\naccess that Public Document Folder.\n\n262\n00:13:47.612 --> 00:13:48.316\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so\n\n263\n00:13:48.316 --> 00:13:51.966\nI've switched over to a second\nmachine that's part of the domain.\n\n264\n00:13:51.966 --> 00:13:56.814\nAnd I'm trying to connect back to that\nfirst machine across the network,\n\n265\n00:13:56.814 --> 00:13:59.249\nusing basically a UNC path, right?\n\n266\n00:13:59.249 --> 00:14:01.017\n// A name of that computer.\n\n267\n00:14:01.017 --> 00:14:06.050\nIf I go down to network, I can see\nactually network discovery is turned off.\n\n268\n00:14:06.050 --> 00:14:07.896\nAnd we'll turn that on\nhere in just a minute.\n\n269\n00:14:07.896 --> 00:14:09.534\nThere's the error I was looking for.\n\n270\n00:14:09.534 --> 00:14:11.064\nWindows cannot access Client 01.\n\n271\n00:14:11.064 --> 00:14:14.691\nSo, I'll go and cancel that, and\n\n272\n00:14:14.691 --> 00:14:18.954\nI'm gonna flip back over to Client one.\n\n273\n00:14:18.954 --> 00:14:26.047\nGo back into my advanced sharing options,\nif it'll let me.\n\n274\n00:14:26.047 --> 00:14:30.635\nThere is it, and\nwe're gonna turn on Public Folder sharing,\n\n275\n00:14:30.635 --> 00:14:32.674\nI'll save those changes.\n\n276\n00:14:32.674 --> 00:14:36.515\nNow, I'm gonna go back over to client two,\nopen up file explorer, and\n\n277\n00:14:36.515 --> 00:14:38.128\nlet's see what happens now.\n\n278\n00:14:38.128 --> 00:14:43.275\nClient 01, and look at that,\nall of the sudden,\n\n279\n00:14:43.275 --> 00:14:47.839\nnow, when I navigate\nto that other machine.\n\n280\n00:14:47.839 --> 00:14:52.557\nWhen I try to connect via the network\nto that first client machine,\n\n281\n00:14:52.557 --> 00:14:54.333\nI see this Users folder.\n\n282\n00:14:54.333 --> 00:14:57.353\nAnd if I double click on that,\nI'll see all of these profiles.\n\n283\n00:14:57.353 --> 00:14:59.572\nNow, these are locked up, well.\n\n284\n00:14:59.572 --> 00:15:04.763\nShouldn't be able to actually get\naccess to some of those, wow.\n\n285\n00:15:04.763 --> 00:15:09.540\nWe'll have to check on that and see why,\nbut here are the Public Folder.\n\n286\n00:15:09.540 --> 00:15:13.347\nHere's Public Documents,\nand notice there is Draft.\n\n287\n00:15:13.347 --> 00:15:18.604\nI'm logged in as, I think I'm logged\nin as the domain admin account,\n\n288\n00:15:18.604 --> 00:15:24.107\nlet's see.\n&gt;&gt; Is that what Mike was set at?\n\n289\n00:15:24.107 --> 00:15:24.995\n&gt;&gt; Yes, if I am,\n\n290\n00:15:24.995 --> 00:15:28.771\nlet me just pull up my command\nprompt here, yeah, I am Mike.\n\n291\n00:15:28.771 --> 00:15:32.834\nI'm logged in as the domain admin,\nwhich is why I was able to easily navigate\n\n292\n00:15:32.834 --> 00:15:37.359\ninto some of those other folders that\nwouldn't normally be available, all right?\n\n293\n00:15:37.359 --> 00:15:40.844\nBut, the point of this is,\nlet's not lose track of where we're going.\n\n294\n00:15:40.844 --> 00:15:45.525\nIs that now, via the network I\ncan access those Public Folders.\n\n295\n00:15:45.525 --> 00:15:48.243\nSo, if I wanna share\nsomething with a coworker.\n\n296\n00:15:48.243 --> 00:15:53.384\nAnd I can't make a share because I'm not\nan administrator on my local machine.\n\n297\n00:15:53.384 --> 00:15:57.068\nHow can I share something with Cherokee,\nfor example, on the network?\n\n298\n00:15:57.068 --> 00:15:59.347\nI can simply drop it\ninto my Public Folders.\n\n299\n00:15:59.347 --> 00:16:02.137\nI can tell Cherokee, hey,\ngo open up File Explorer.\n\n300\n00:16:02.137 --> 00:16:05.074\nBack slash, back slash,\nhere's the name of my computer.\n\n301\n00:16:05.074 --> 00:16:08.126\nAnd you should be able to\nnavigate into my public folders.\n\n302\n00:16:08.126 --> 00:16:11.388\nAnd you'll have read and\nwrite access, right?\n\n303\n00:16:11.388 --> 00:16:16.782\nNow, let's see what changed when we\nlooked at the permissions earlier,\n\n304\n00:16:16.782 --> 00:16:21.420\nthe interactive logon group\nhad modified permissions.\n\n305\n00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:26.130\nNow that I've turned on public\nfolder sharing, something changed.\n\n306\n00:16:26.130 --> 00:16:30.810\nSo we're gonna go Users, Public,\nwe'll right click on that Public Documents\n\n307\n00:16:30.810 --> 00:16:33.872\nagain, Properties,\nwe're gonna go Security tab,\n\n308\n00:16:33.872 --> 00:16:38.350\nall right, and let's see what we got here.\n\n309\n00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:40.399\nLet's zoom into this guy.\n\n310\n00:16:41.559 --> 00:16:44.781\nAnd now notice that the Everyone group,\n\n311\n00:16:44.781 --> 00:16:48.775\nthere should be actually one more,\nnot service.\n\n312\n00:16:51.285 --> 00:16:58.122\nThe Everyone group has full control,\nwhich is actually a little bit scary.\n\n313\n00:16:58.122 --> 00:17:01.675\nI'm gonna hit Advanced real quick and\nsee if I can show you.\n\n314\n00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:09.222\nI was actually looking for\na different group,\n\n315\n00:17:09.222 --> 00:17:11.690\nthat's kind of surprising\nthat it's not there.\n\n316\n00:17:11.690 --> 00:17:17.430\nIf we go to Sharing, though, here's where\nit's gonna be, I was in the wrong screen.\n\n317\n00:17:17.430 --> 00:17:19.940\nWe go to Sharing,\nI can see that it is shared out.\n\n318\n00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:23.690\nNow before, it wasn't shared,\nper se, right.\n\n319\n00:17:23.690 --> 00:17:27.460\nIt was made available to other\nusers on this machine, but\n\n320\n00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:28.740\nnot available to the network.\n\n321\n00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:32.130\nNow, remember, sharing is all about making\nsomething available to the network.\n\n322\n00:17:32.130 --> 00:17:34.819\nSo, now that I've turned\non Public Folder Sharing,\n\n323\n00:17:34.819 --> 00:17:36.739\nthere's actually a share path here.\n\n324\n00:17:36.739 --> 00:17:42.900\nAnd, if I take a look at the Permissions,\nwe're gonna see that Everyone\n\n325\n00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:48.659\nhas been given Read/Write\npermissions over this folder, right.\n\n326\n00:17:48.659 --> 00:17:53.395\nSo, with Public Sharing folder turned off,\nanybody that can login,\n\n327\n00:17:53.395 --> 00:17:55.420\nhas access to them.\n\n328\n00:17:55.420 --> 00:17:57.460\nWith Public Folder Sharing turned on,\n\n329\n00:17:57.460 --> 00:18:00.030\nanybody on the network\nnow has access to them.\n\n330\n00:18:00.030 --> 00:18:01.070\nAll right?\n\n331\n00:18:01.070 --> 00:18:05.510\nSo it's a quick easy way for users to\nshare documents amongst co-workers, and\n\n332\n00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:06.460\nthat's what we're looking for.\n\n333\n00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:07.980\nAnd that's what this is trying to solve.\n\n334\n00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:12.060\nThis is not something\nyou use on a file server\n\n335\n00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:15.870\nto make files available\nto the corporate network.\n\n336\n00:18:15.870 --> 00:18:19.540\nThis is something simple\nthat in a home environment,\n\n337\n00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:23.890\nin a small office where there's not\na domain, a little work group environment.\n\n338\n00:18:23.890 --> 00:18:27.792\nOr even a domain environment where I just\nwanna share something really quick with\n\n339\n00:18:27.792 --> 00:18:28.810\nthe co-worker.\n\n340\n00:18:28.810 --> 00:18:32.370\nThis is what you tell your users to do,\nthis is the easiest way to do it.\n\n341\n00:18:32.370 --> 00:18:36.200\nThere are some caveats or\nsome downsides to using Public Folders.\n\n342\n00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:38.090\nOne, permissions, right?\n\n343\n00:18:38.090 --> 00:18:41.120\nWe don't wanna change\nthe permissions on these.\n\n344\n00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:44.220\nNotice everybody has\nRead/Write permission and\n\n345\n00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:45.730\nthat can be a little bit of an issue,\nright?\n\n346\n00:18:45.730 --> 00:18:48.940\nIf I wanted to share something with my\nco-workers but I didn't want them to\n\n347\n00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:53.680\nbe able to change it, Public Folder\nSharing is gonna be a bad option, right?\n\n348\n00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:57.300\nBecause everybody's gonna\nhave that modify permission.\n\n349\n00:18:57.300 --> 00:19:01.780\nMicrosoft will tell you, don't change\nthe permissions on your Public Folders.\n\n350\n00:19:01.780 --> 00:19:04.150\nUse them for what they're intended.\n\n351\n00:19:04.150 --> 00:19:09.060\nIf you need to limit access, you're gonna\nhave to do a different type of sharing,\n\n352\n00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:10.830\nwhich we're gonna show you in a second.\n\n353\n00:19:10.830 --> 00:19:15.830\nSo the main thing for this exam is,\nunderstand what Public Folder Sharing is,\n\n354\n00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:18.730\nand understand what\nscenario I would use it.\n\n355\n00:19:18.730 --> 00:19:23.240\nAnd that is when I wanna make files\navailable either to everybody that can log\n\n356\n00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:26.390\ninto the machine or\neverybody on the network.\n\n357\n00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:30.222\nAnd I'm okay with everybody\nhaving Read/Write access, okay?\n\n358\n00:19:30.222 --> 00:19:32.352\nIf I want any more control with that,\n\n359\n00:19:32.352 --> 00:19:35.850\nPublic Folder Sharing is\nnot gonna be the way to go.\n\n360\n00:19:35.850 --> 00:19:38.585\nRight, but it easy, right, pretty cool.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean,\n\n361\n00:19:38.585 --> 00:19:40.870\neasy enough.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely, and\n\n362\n00:19:40.870 --> 00:19:45.880\nlike a I said in a non-domain environment\nor just a quick share, it's really easy.\n\n363\n00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:48.530\nAnother one that you wanna pay\nattention to in Public Folder Sharing\n\n364\n00:19:49.750 --> 00:19:53.502\nis don't copy documents and\nput them in here.\n\n365\n00:19:53.502 --> 00:19:56.219\n[SOUND] May not because it doesn't work,\nbut\n\n366\n00:19:56.219 --> 00:19:59.677\nbecause now you've got two\ncopies of the file, right?\n\n367\n00:19:59.677 --> 00:20:02.863\nAnd if somebody makes changes\nto the copy in public documents,\n\n368\n00:20:02.863 --> 00:20:05.640\nthat doesn't change the copy\nlocated anywhere else.\n\n369\n00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:09.170\nFor example,\nif I had a file in my documents,\n\n370\n00:20:09.170 --> 00:20:14.220\nthis is not shared,\nthis is my private, right, my profile.\n\n371\n00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:15.980\nAnd I just call this one test.\n\n372\n00:20:15.980 --> 00:20:20.363\nIf I wanted to share this out, I wouldn't\ncopy it and put it into public folders,\n\n373\n00:20:20.363 --> 00:20:24.503\nbecause now I've got two copies of\nthe file, and I've got version issues.\n\n374\n00:20:24.503 --> 00:20:25.006\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n375\n00:20:25.006 --> 00:20:26.850\n&gt;&gt; It's gonna cause problems, right?\n\n376\n00:20:26.850 --> 00:20:33.910\nYou're better off cutting this, right,\nand moving it to those public folders.\n\n377\n00:20:36.180 --> 00:20:39.300\nThat way there's only one\ncopy of the document.\n\n378\n00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:42.080\nAnd you can make shortcuts to public\nfolders if you wanna put it on your\n\n379\n00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:42.640\ndesktop so\n\n380\n00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:46.220\nit's a little bit easier to get to, if\nit's something that you use all the time.\n\n381\n00:20:47.750 --> 00:20:51.310\nAll right, so that takes care of\nPublic Folders Sharing, I think,\n\n382\n00:20:51.310 --> 00:20:54.429\ntrying to make sure there's nothing\nelse I wanted to say about those guys.\n\n383\n00:20:57.560 --> 00:20:58.560\nSo I think we're good there.\n\n384\n00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:00.796\nGood to go, Cherokee?\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I was just thinking,\n\n385\n00:21:00.796 --> 00:21:04.072\nI think you're gonna get to this in\na little bit, but it's really kind of,\n\n386\n00:21:04.072 --> 00:21:06.620\nthere are a lot of different\nways that we can access files.\n\n387\n00:21:06.620 --> 00:21:09.580\nAnd you said, look, this is an easy,\nquick way for me to share, right?\n\n388\n00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:12.360\nWhat if you have a user who says,\n\n389\n00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:15.970\nwell, why don't I use remote desktop\nto take a look at your file?\n\n390\n00:21:15.970 --> 00:21:18.500\nWhat do you say to those people, Mike?\n&gt;&gt; Well, one,\n\n391\n00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:20.820\nthey would need remote\ndesktop permissions, right?\n\n392\n00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:22.920\nWhich most likely they don't have.\n\n393\n00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:27.010\nUnless they're administrators,\nI would have to give them permission.\n\n394\n00:21:27.010 --> 00:21:30.010\nAnd when we talk about remote desktop,\nyou're,\n\n395\n00:21:30.010 --> 00:21:34.200\nif you tried to remote into my computer,\nI would lose access to my machine, right?\n\n396\n00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:36.830\nI would get the lock screen,\nand you would remote into it.\n\n397\n00:21:36.830 --> 00:21:38.300\nAnd so I could not work.\n\n398\n00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:42.850\nSo it's not really an effective\nway to do sharing like that.\n\n399\n00:21:42.850 --> 00:21:45.860\nIt's really not meant for that.\n\n400\n00:21:45.860 --> 00:21:49.307\nSo, I would say yeah, that's something,\nand we will talk about remote desktop\n\n401\n00:21:49.307 --> 00:21:52.480\nbecause it is a viable option, but\nnot really for sharing things.\n\n402\n00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:55.740\nBecause the way the client\nOS works cuz I can only have\n\n403\n00:21:55.740 --> 00:21:58.120\none interactive logon at a time.\n\n404\n00:21:58.120 --> 00:22:02.340\nIf I'm using my machine, and let's say you\ndid have permissions to remote into it.\n\n405\n00:22:02.340 --> 00:22:06.286\nI'm sitting here working, Cherokee decides\nshe wants to remote and look at that file-\n\n406\n00:22:06.286 --> 00:22:07.458\n&gt;&gt; Mike gets to go on a break.\n\n407\n00:22:07.458 --> 00:22:08.391\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And again,\n\n408\n00:22:08.391 --> 00:22:11.008\nall of a sudden my screen locks,\nor I get a message that says hey,\n\n409\n00:22:11.008 --> 00:22:12.440\nsomebody's trying to remote in.\n\n410\n00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:16.767\nDo you wanna allow them, and I usually say\nno or I say I don't know what this is,\n\n411\n00:22:16.767 --> 00:22:20.130\nyes and all of a sudden I'm locked out and\nyou're accessed.\n\n412\n00:22:20.130 --> 00:22:22.854\nSo, probably not what we\nwanna do at this stage.\n\n413\n00:22:22.854 --> 00:22:26.177\nAll right, now, we're gonna talk,\nI know we're getting a little\n\n414\n00:22:26.177 --> 00:22:29.984\nbit short on time but I wanna talk about,\nactually you know what, Cherokee?\n\n415\n00:22:29.984 --> 00:22:30.798\nWhy don't we stop there?\n\n416\n00:22:30.798 --> 00:22:33.508\nBecause I don't wanna rush\nthrough the next sharing method.\n\n417\n00:22:33.508 --> 00:22:34.727\n&gt;&gt; Share these processes?\n\n418\n00:22:34.727 --> 00:22:35.662\nOkay.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and\n\n419\n00:22:35.662 --> 00:22:38.513\nI think we're better off saving that for\npart two.\n\n420\n00:22:38.513 --> 00:22:40.295\nYou know me and my parts,\nI love part twos and threes.\n\n421\n00:22:40.295 --> 00:22:42.029\n&gt;&gt; Yeah we're gonna have some parts here,\n\n422\n00:22:42.029 --> 00:22:43.000\nI have a feeling Mike.\n\n423\n00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:43.900\nBut that's okay.\n\n424\n00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:45.330\nThank you for being thorough.\n\n425\n00:22:45.330 --> 00:22:48.320\nThank you guys for hanging in there\nwith us, but for now let's sign out.\n\n426\n00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:50.520\nI've been your host Cherokee Boose.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n427\n00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:53.181\nSee you next time here at ITPro.TV.\n\n428\n00:22:53.181 --> 00:22:59.076\n[MUSIC]\n\n429\n00:22:59.076 --> 00:23:01.655\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPro.TV.\n\n",

California.\n&gt;&gt; You're\n\n3\n00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:12.350\nwatching ITProTV.\n&gt;&gt; Welcome,\n\n4\n00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:16.517\neveryone to your Configuring Windows\nDevices Series for that 70-697 exam.\n\n5\n00:00:16.517 --> 00:00:19.090\nI'm your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:22.979\nSo this is a part two where we will\ncontinue taking a look at how we can\n\n7\n00:00:22.979 --> 00:00:25.770\nconfigure shared resources and\nyou know what?\n\n8\n00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:28.547\nWe were able to get Mike back in studios,\n\n9\n00:00:28.547 --> 00:00:30.268\nhe agreed.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well,\n\n10\n00:00:30.268 --> 00:00:31.743\nthey've got me chained down here.\n\n11\n00:00:31.743 --> 00:00:34.130\nWhat you can't see is I can't leave.\n\n12\n00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:35.610\nNo, I'm kidding.\nOf course, I came back.\n\n13\n00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.461\nI'm excited as always, if you're\ntalking to everybody out there and\n\n14\n00:00:39.461 --> 00:00:42.216\ncontinuing on as you said\nwith shared resources.\n\n15\n00:00:42.216 --> 00:00:45.130\nSo in part one, if you missed it,\nmake sure you go back and check it out.\n\n16\n00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:47.613\nWe talked then a little bit about\nin general what sharing meant.\n\n17\n00:00:47.613 --> 00:00:51.679\nThe idea of making resources\navailable to the network and\n\n18\n00:00:51.679 --> 00:00:54.313\nwe looked at public folder sharing.\n\n19\n00:00:54.313 --> 00:00:56.788\nSomething built into Windows 10 and\n\n20\n00:00:56.788 --> 00:01:02.070\nan easy way to share resources with\npeople that have access to the machine.\n\n21\n00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.494\nAnybody that can sign on or\n\n22\n00:01:03.494 --> 00:01:06.806\nlogin to this machine can access\npublic folders by default.\n\n23\n00:01:06.806 --> 00:01:09.930\nWe also saw how it can turn\non public folder sharing.\n\n24\n00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.077\nAnd then all of a sudden, make those\npublic folders available to the network,\n\n25\n00:01:13.077 --> 00:01:14.520\nso that anybody could access them.\n\n26\n00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.553\nBut we also said that there were some\nlimitations to public folders in the fact\n\n27\n00:01:18.553 --> 00:01:20.860\nthat we really can't control the access.\n\n28\n00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:26.370\nI say, we can't and we can, but\nMicrosoft's gonna recommend that we don't.\n\n29\n00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:30.017\nThey're designed to give\neverybody read and write access,\n\n30\n00:01:30.017 --> 00:01:34.879\neither on the machine if it's turned off\nor on to the network if it's turned on and\n\n31\n00:01:34.879 --> 00:01:37.380\nthat's what we should use it for.\n\n32\n00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.734\nIf we want more control, if we don't\nwant people to have write permissions,\n\n33\n00:01:40.734 --> 00:01:43.537\nmaybe I wanna share something out,\nso everybody can look at it.\n\n34\n00:01:43.537 --> 00:01:45.741\nBut I don't want them\nmaking changes to it,\n\n35\n00:01:45.741 --> 00:01:48.930\nthen public folder sharing\nis not the one I should use.\n\n36\n00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.353\nI should use a different sharing method\nand that's what we're gonna look at here\n\n37\n00:01:53.353 --> 00:01:56.880\nis how do we go about creating\nshares other than public folders.\n\n38\n00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.138\nSo what he said in that first\nepisode in order to create shares,\n\n39\n00:02:00.138 --> 00:02:03.160\nyou do have to have administrative\nrights on the machine.\n\n40\n00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.500\nSo that's a good test question,\nkeep that in mind.\n\n41\n00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.970\nYou need administrative\naccess to create shares.\n\n42\n00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.291\nSo if I wanna share something, there's two\ndifferent ways I can go about sharing it.\n\n43\n00:02:13.291 --> 00:02:18.610\nI can use what's called a basic sharing\nwizard or we can do our advanced sharing.\n\n44\n00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.822\nThis is known Microsoft calls this\nany folder sharing to differentiate\n\n45\n00:02:22.822 --> 00:02:24.163\nfrom public folders.\n\n46\n00:02:24.163 --> 00:02:28.991\nYou got public folders which are specific\nfolders within that user's container and\n\n47\n00:02:28.991 --> 00:02:33.343\nthen there's any folder which means I\ncan go to any folder on my machine, and\n\n48\n00:02:33.343 --> 00:02:36.460\nmake that available or share that out.\n\n49\n00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:38.148\nSo let's take a look at my screen here and\n\n50\n00:02:38.148 --> 00:02:40.490\nlet's see how we go about\nworking with shared folders.\n\n51\n00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:44.370\nI am logged on as an administrator.\n\n52\n00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:49.701\nAnd on my E drive over here,\nI've created a folder called Project Data.\n\n53\n00:02:49.701 --> 00:02:52.322\nAnd in there,\nI just made up a couple of documents and\n\n54\n00:02:52.322 --> 00:02:54.410\nthere's another folder inside there.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n55\n00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.130\n&gt;&gt; With a couple documents.\n\n56\n00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.190\nYeah, I couldn't think\nof anything to call it.\n\n57\n00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:02.326\nI'm not the most creative\nperson in the world, so\n\n58\n00:03:02.326 --> 00:03:04.021\nI called it stuff.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n59\n00:03:04.021 --> 00:03:05.015\n&gt;&gt; But let's say,\n\n60\n00:03:05.015 --> 00:03:08.090\nI wanna make this\navailable to the network.\n\n61\n00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.598\nI've got a team that's working\non this project with me.\n\n62\n00:03:10.598 --> 00:03:13.570\nI've got all this stuff on my computer,\nbut we're a team.\n\n63\n00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:16.350\nWe're supposed to be working on it so\nhow do they get access to it?\n\n64\n00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:21.701\nWell I right-click on the folder and\nI'm gonna pull-up properties,\n\n65\n00:03:21.701 --> 00:03:24.830\nand you'll see that I have a sharing tab.\n\n66\n00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:27.460\nAnd before we go any further,\nI wanna refresh.\n\n67\n00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:32.021\nIf I go inside here and\nright-click on one of these documents and\n\n68\n00:03:32.021 --> 00:03:36.760\npull-up properties,\nnotice I do not have a sharing tab.\n\n69\n00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.846\nKeep that in mind,\nyou cannot share documents directly.\n\n70\n00:03:39.846 --> 00:03:44.933\nYou share folders, which makes the\ndocuments inside those folders available.\n\n71\n00:03:44.933 --> 00:03:50.448\nSo we're gonna back backup to my outer\nfolder here, gonna right-click and\n\n72\n00:03:50.448 --> 00:03:55.630\npull-up the properties and\nI'm gonna head on over to the sharing tab.\n\n73\n00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:58.570\nAnd here you'll see,\nI have two options on my sharing tab.\n\n74\n00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:02.790\nI have a Share button and\nthen I have it Advanced Sharing.\n\n75\n00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:06.345\nIf you've been doing this for\na little while,\n\n76\n00:04:06.345 --> 00:04:09.470\nI can't remember when they\ncame out with basic sharing.\n\n77\n00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:12.473\nI wanna say it was Windows 7, but\n\n78\n00:04:12.473 --> 00:04:18.170\nthis Advanced Sharing is what you\nused to know as just sharing.\n\n79\n00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:19.110\nThat was all we had.\n\n80\n00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:23.218\nNow, they've go this what we\ncall basic sharing wizard and\n\n81\n00:04:23.218 --> 00:04:26.890\nwe need to differentiate\nbetween these two.\n\n82\n00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:29.030\nSo if I wanna share this out,\nlet's start with the basic sharing wizard.\n\n83\n00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:35.620\nI'm gonna click the share button and\nthat's gonna launch my share wizard.\n\n84\n00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:38.360\nChose people on your\nnetwork to share with.\n\n85\n00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:42.380\nType a name and then click add or\nclick the arrow to find someone.\n\n86\n00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:45.594\nSo I can hit this little\ndrop-down list and\n\n87\n00:04:45.594 --> 00:04:49.260\nI can chose everyone or\nI can choose find people.\n\n88\n00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.280\nIf I chose find people,\n\n89\n00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:57.350\nIt opens up a little select dialog\nbox that I could look for say, Titus.\n\n90\n00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:02.305\nCheck names on here and you can see\nI just added Titus to the list, and\n\n91\n00:05:02.305 --> 00:05:05.429\nthen I can choose what\npermissions I wanna give Titus.\n\n92\n00:05:05.429 --> 00:05:10.140\nDo I wanna give him read or\ndo I wanna give him read and write?\n\n93\n00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:12.707\nNow when it comes to, and\nlet me move that over, so\n\n94\n00:05:12.707 --> 00:05:14.981\nyou guys can see right\nbehind my head there.\n\n95\n00:05:14.981 --> 00:05:19.240\nSo you can see, I've got read, but\nI could also give them or Titus.\n\n96\n00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.530\nIn this case, Read/Write permission.\n\n97\n00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:23.220\nWe can also do groups.\n\n98\n00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:26.420\nIf I go back up to this drop down list and\nchoose find people,\n\n99\n00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:30.590\nI could do something like, I think I've\ngot a group called directors maybe.\n\n100\n00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:36.900\nYeah, we'll get the directors group and I\ncan assign permissions to a group as well.\n\n101\n00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:40.530\nNow we'll talk more about using groups\n\n102\n00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:45.230\nversus individuals when we get into our\nfile permissions, our NTFS permissions.\n\n103\n00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:47.540\nI think we'll save that conversation for\nthen.\n\n104\n00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:51.640\nRight now, we just wanna focus on\nsharing and how we go about this.\n\n105\n00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:58.862\nSo easy enough and the idea behind this\nwizard is this is something that a typical\n\n106\n00:05:58.862 --> 00:06:04.130\nend user would be able to do, again, if\nthey're administrators on their machine.\n\n107\n00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:10.640\nSo I've chosen who I want to share this\nwith, I click, share and that's it.\n\n108\n00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:12.410\nI'm done.\n\n109\n00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:15.916\nIf I zoom in here, you'll see that\nI now have, it tells me I can\n\n110\n00:06:15.916 --> 00:06:20.380\nemail someone these links or I can copy\nand paste these links into another app.\n\n111\n00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:24.850\nThere is the path to get to\nthis folder that I just shared.\n\n112\n00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:32.340\nNow that path is known as something called\na, I'd be a little more redundant there.\n\n113\n00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:37.650\nThat path is a UNC path,\na universal naming convention.\n\n114\n00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:44.168\nAnd it follows the format backslash,\nbackslash name of the computer,\n\n115\n00:06:44.168 --> 00:06:51.910\nbackslash name of the resource and in\nthe folder I just shared is Project Data.\n\n116\n00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:55.776\nSo the UNC path is\n\\\\CLIENT01\\Project Data.\n\n117\n00:06:55.776 --> 00:07:00.682\nAnybody that wants to access this\nshare is gonna need that path and\n\n118\n00:07:00.682 --> 00:07:05.870\nthat's why it tells me I can email\nsomeone, and it's pretty handy.\n\n119\n00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:07.730\nI don't have email set up\non this client machine.\n\n120\n00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:09.880\nI'm not running exchange or anything.\n\n121\n00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:13.485\nBut if I was in a normal corporate office,\nI could click this link and\n\n122\n00:07:13.485 --> 00:07:17.100\nit would actually open up my email\nclient and put that link in there.\n\n123\n00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:20.898\nAnd I could send it to whomever\nin the organization that I wanted\n\n124\n00:07:20.898 --> 00:07:24.290\nto share this with or\nI can copy it to my clipboard.\n\n125\n00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:28.907\nAnd I can go compose an email or\nwhat have you or instant message the link\n\n126\n00:07:28.907 --> 00:07:33.230\nright over to somebody, but\nthat's what they are going to need.\n\n127\n00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:34.570\nSo I'll click Done.\n\n128\n00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:38.240\nAnd now I'll zoom back out,\nso you can see where I'm at.\n\n129\n00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:42.920\nBack out to that sharing tab and\nthere I can see that it is shared.\n\n130\n00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:46.730\nIt's telling me there's resources\nshared and there is the network path.\n\n131\n00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:47.827\n&gt;&gt; You know, Mike,\n\n132\n00:07:47.827 --> 00:07:52.445\nsometimes when Microsoft gets user\nfeedback for their operating system.\n\n133\n00:07:52.445 --> 00:07:56.244\nI feel like this might have been one of\nthose things they got some feedback on and\n\n134\n00:07:56.244 --> 00:07:59.237\nthey said, look, we want a really\neasy way to manage share and\n\n135\n00:07:59.237 --> 00:08:01.160\nwhat you just showed us was super easy.\n\n136\n00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:03.518\nI mean,\nyou even had the option to email someone.\n\n137\n00:08:03.518 --> 00:08:05.770\nSo I could literally, that would be it.\n\n138\n00:08:05.770 --> 00:08:08.426\nAnd you would already, if I wanted\nto share with you, you would get\n\n139\n00:08:08.426 --> 00:08:10.680\nthat notification and there you go.\n&gt;&gt; And that's it.\n\n140\n00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:11.840\nYeah, and that's the idea.\n\n141\n00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:13.510\nThis is a very easy way.\n\n142\n00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:16.470\nAnd I know there are some\nenvironments where we do allow our\n\n143\n00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:18.910\nusers to be admins on\ntheir local machines.\n\n144\n00:08:18.910 --> 00:08:22.380\nEspecially nowadays with\nBYOD type situations,\n\n145\n00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:25.720\nwhere it's their laptop that they\nbring in to work, and we manage it.\n\n146\n00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:29.240\nBut they're admins, because it's\nalso their personal laptop and\n\n147\n00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:32.570\nwhen they take it home they need to\nbe able to do administrative things.\n\n148\n00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:35.760\nSo, for situations like that,\nwhere your users are admins,\n\n149\n00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:40.710\nthis is a very easy way for them to\nmake resources available to the network.\n\n150\n00:08:40.710 --> 00:08:43.960\nAnd what we haven't talked\nabout are NTFS permissions.\n\n151\n00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:47.230\nThose are coming up a little bit\nlater in our list of objectives.\n\n152\n00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:51.370\nBut that is something that as\nwe're studying for this exam,\n\n153\n00:08:51.370 --> 00:08:53.360\nwe have to be familiar with.\n\n154\n00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:56.720\nBut an end user is not going\nto wanna be familiar with it.\n\n155\n00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:57.448\nThey're like,\n\n156\n00:08:57.448 --> 00:08:59.096\nI don't care about any of that.\n&gt;&gt; Just make\n\n157\n00:08:59.096 --> 00:08:59.697\nit work.\n&gt;&gt; I just wanna make\n\n158\n00:08:59.697 --> 00:09:00.288\nthis available, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n159\n00:09:00.288 --> 00:09:01.770\n&gt;&gt; Just make it work.\n\n160\n00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:02.820\nAnd that's what this is all about.\n\n161\n00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:05.750\nThis is hiding some of the complexity\n\n162\n00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:08.880\nthat's required to actually make\nthese available to the network.\n\n163\n00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:13.230\nI didn't have to say anything\nabout NTFS permissions.\n\n164\n00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:15.540\nAll I did was say,\nthis is what I wanna share,\n\n165\n00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:19.890\nthis is who I wanna share it with and\nI wanna give them read or read write.\n\n166\n00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:21.920\nNext and done and we're good, right?\n\n167\n00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:24.380\nIt didn't ask me anything else so\nvery, very,\n\n168\n00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:29.620\nthat's why we call it the basic sharing\nwizard cuz that's all you need.\n\n169\n00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:32.030\nAll right, I'll close those properties.\n\n170\n00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:36.706\nNow, unfortunately, Microsoft change,\nthey don't change the little icon anymore.\n\n171\n00:09:36.706 --> 00:09:40.469\nUsed to be, as you could tell\nsomething was shared out just by,\n\n172\n00:09:40.469 --> 00:09:42.137\nthere was a little hand.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n173\n00:09:42.137 --> 00:09:43.901\nyeah.\n&gt;&gt; That would go underneath the folder.\n\n174\n00:09:43.901 --> 00:09:45.295\n&gt;&gt; Like a server.\n\n175\n00:09:45.295 --> 00:09:46.610\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\n\n176\n00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:49.760\nit indicated that folder was shared out,\nand it doesn't do that anymore,\n\n177\n00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:52.530\nwhich is kinda disappointing, honestly.\n\n178\n00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:56.500\n[LAUGH] But hey, they didn't ask me,\nI didn't design the interface, so\n\n179\n00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:57.290\nthere you go.\n\n180\n00:09:57.290 --> 00:10:01.322\nAll right, now that I've shared it out,\nlets see what we can do with it.\n\n181\n00:10:01.322 --> 00:10:05.520\nI'm gonna go over to a different machine,\nand on this one.\n\n182\n00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:08.332\nI forget who I'm logged on as,\nso let me see here.\n\n183\n00:10:08.332 --> 00:10:09.460\nI'm logged on as Mike.\n\n184\n00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:12.490\nThat's no fun.\n&gt;&gt; Mike, with the advent of emojis,\n\n185\n00:10:12.490 --> 00:10:15.832\nI'm surprised they haven't made their\nway into operating systems these days.\n\n186\n00:10:15.832 --> 00:10:16.864\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I know,\n\n187\n00:10:16.864 --> 00:10:19.000\nthat's probably coming real soon.\n\n188\n00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.640\nI'm gonna log on as Titus.\n\n189\n00:10:23.191 --> 00:10:24.270\nSo here we go.\n\n190\n00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:28.440\nTitus is our world famous director that's\nactually making all the magic happen right\n\n191\n00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:29.910\nnow for this particular show.\n\n192\n00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:32.420\nHe is on the other side\nof our camera here.\n\n193\n00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:35.000\nAnd now I'm logged on as Titus, and\n\n194\n00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.280\nTitus wants to get into\nthat project data folder.\n\n195\n00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:40.220\nI said, hey Titus,\nI got that info available on that project.\n\n196\n00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:41.370\nI've shared it out.\n\n197\n00:10:41.370 --> 00:10:42.490\nYou should be able to get to it.\n\n198\n00:10:42.490 --> 00:10:46.740\nSo he logs into his computer,\nopens up File Explorer.\n\n199\n00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:49.700\nNow how does he get to that share?\n\n200\n00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:52.110\nThat UNC path that the wizard told us.\n\n201\n00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:57.148\nBackslash, backslash, name of the\ncomputer, backslash, name of the resource.\n\n202\n00:10:57.148 --> 00:11:00.999\nSo I'm gonna go up here and\ntype in \\\\client01\\,\n\n203\n00:11:00.999 --> 00:11:04.277\nand look at that,\nI didn't even have to type.\n\n204\n00:11:04.277 --> 00:11:07.710\nIf I can get this to zoom in here.\n\n205\n00:11:07.710 --> 00:11:12.400\nIt won't zoom in while I have that open,\nbut there I can see project data.\n\n206\n00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:16.550\nAnd I selected it and\nI'm connected, right.\n\n207\n00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:18.440\nIf you, I wish I could zoom in.\n\n208\n00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:24.350\nLet me real quick fix that so\nwe can see what's going on.\n\n209\n00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:26.700\nSo don't pay any attention to\nwhat's going on right now.\n\n210\n00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:31.030\nLet's copy that, paste that.\n\n211\n00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:35.376\nAnd run that.\nA great little tool from Microsoft if\n\n212\n00:11:35.376 --> 00:11:40.223\nanybody's curious called zoom it by\nSysinternals or now Winternals that\n\n213\n00:11:40.223 --> 00:11:45.720\nallows me to zoom into the screen so\nthat you can see what the heck I'm doing.\n\n214\n00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:46.945\nSo let's try that one more time.\n\n215\n00:11:46.945 --> 00:11:51.290\n\\\\client01, and\n\n216\n00:11:51.290 --> 00:11:55.790\nthen as soon as I get that next back\nslash, I actually see that shared folder.\n\n217\n00:11:55.790 --> 00:11:58.950\nSo I can continue to type or\n\n218\n00:11:58.950 --> 00:12:02.330\nI could just simply select\nimages [INAUDIBLE] here, right?\n\n219\n00:12:02.330 --> 00:12:03.590\nThat is the UNC path, and\n\n220\n00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:07.120\nit shows I connect to it,\nI can see everything that's inside there.\n\n221\n00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:09.280\nAnd here's an important note, right.\n\n222\n00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:12.280\nI shared the folder Project Data.\n\n223\n00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:14.010\nEverything there inside is now available.\n\n224\n00:12:14.010 --> 00:12:17.920\nThere's the three documents and\nthat folder called Stuff.\n\n225\n00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:21.580\nInside Stuff there's three\nmore files inside there.\n\n226\n00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:24.830\nAnd I didn't have to share\nout each individual thing.\n\n227\n00:12:24.830 --> 00:12:29.660\nOnce you share at a certain level,\neverything inside there is now available\n\n228\n00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:33.025\nand this is a downside of shares.\n&gt;&gt; Good to know though so,\n\n229\n00:12:33.025 --> 00:12:37.184\nyou're not assuming that you have some\nkind of implied security that you really\n\n230\n00:12:37.184 --> 00:12:38.910\ndon't have there.\n&gt;&gt; You really don't.\n\n231\n00:12:38.910 --> 00:12:43.260\nWhen you set share informations,\nyou set it and everything inside there,\n\n232\n00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:46.700\nnow follows those and\nI can't go in here and be more specific\n\n233\n00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:52.010\nwith my share informations or block access\nat least using share informations, right.\n\n234\n00:12:52.010 --> 00:12:53.090\nYou have no control.\n\n235\n00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:55.832\nWell, we'll come back,\n\n236\n00:12:55.832 --> 00:13:00.280\nwe'll circle around we kinda come back\nto that thought in just a minute.\n\n237\n00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:04.470\nAll right, so as far as basic Sharing\nWizard goes, that was pretty easy, right?\n\n238\n00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:06.860\nAll of a sudden,\nI've made this folder available.\n\n239\n00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:08.690\nI gave Titus Read, and Write permission.\n\n240\n00:13:08.690 --> 00:13:12.870\nSo, he should be able to\nopen up one of these files.\n\n241\n00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:14.480\nTitus was here.\n\n242\n00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.070\nAnd save it, and close it.\n\n243\n00:13:18.070 --> 00:13:23.210\nSo you could see he definitely has\nRead and Write Permissions, right?\n\n244\n00:13:24.430 --> 00:13:27.600\nAll right, so-\n&gt;&gt; Have we graduated to the advanced\n\n245\n00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:29.946\nsettings, Mike?\n&gt;&gt; Almost, I think.\n\n246\n00:13:29.946 --> 00:13:31.289\nWhat have we got?\n\n247\n00:13:31.289 --> 00:13:33.929\nYeah, let's go back over here.\n\n248\n00:13:33.929 --> 00:13:37.821\nSo that was, again,\nthe basic Sharing Wizard.\n\n249\n00:13:37.821 --> 00:13:41.095\nTry to think if there was something else\nI really wanted to tell you guys about\n\n250\n00:13:41.095 --> 00:13:41.870\nthat wizard.\n\n251\n00:13:41.870 --> 00:13:46.570\nWe talked about how you can't be\nanymore granular with the control\n\n252\n00:13:46.570 --> 00:13:51.060\nas far as files and folders inside there.\n\n253\n00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:53.170\nI think we're good with that.\n\n254\n00:13:53.170 --> 00:13:55.780\nIf I don't want to share this anymore,\n\n255\n00:13:55.780 --> 00:14:00.300\nI can simply go back into\nthe Properties of that folder, right?\n\n256\n00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:04.460\nAnd I can,\nI don't know if it'll let me do it here.\n\n257\n00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:05.500\nIt will not.\n\n258\n00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:07.110\nIf we don't want to share this anymore,\n\n259\n00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:11.290\nwhen I right-click on this folder,\nI can choose Remove Access.\n\n260\n00:14:11.290 --> 00:14:12.330\nAnd let me zoom in.\n\n261\n00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:15.620\nThey've actually changed\nthis in a recent update.\n\n262\n00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:18.810\nI don't know if it was the Fall Creator's\nor the Spring Creator's.\n\n263\n00:14:18.810 --> 00:14:20.720\nThis used to be Share with.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n264\n00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:23.337\n&gt;&gt; And then you would see Specific people\n\n265\n00:14:23.337 --> 00:14:24.920\nor Remove access.\n\n266\n00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:26.607\nNow it says Give access to, so\n\n267\n00:14:26.607 --> 00:14:30.660\njust something to keep in mind if you\nguys have worked with this before.\n\n268\n00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:33.700\nYou're like, where's my share option?\n\n269\n00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:35.530\nIt's now called Give access to.\n\n270\n00:14:35.530 --> 00:14:38.380\nTrying to be a little more user friendly.\n\n271\n00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:40.169\nBut here I can choose Remove access.\n\n272\n00:14:41.536 --> 00:14:45.120\nAnd let me zoom as you can see that,\nI can either Stop sharing or\n\n273\n00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:47.932\nI can Change that sharing permission.\n\n274\n00:14:47.932 --> 00:14:52.340\nI choose Stop sharing, obviously,\nthat's gonna stop sharing all together.\n\n275\n00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:56.140\nChange sharing permissions, is actually\njust gonna take me back to the screen\n\n276\n00:14:56.140 --> 00:15:00.400\nhere, where I can either add additional\npeople or I can say, you know what?\n\n277\n00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:03.730\nTitus is making some changes that\nI really didn't want him to do, so\n\n278\n00:15:03.730 --> 00:15:08.380\nI'm gonna change it to Read,\nand click Share, all right?\n\n279\n00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:11.440\nSo when you right-click on it you can get\n\n280\n00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:14.900\nback into the Share Wizard to\nchange people's permissions.\n\n281\n00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:19.440\nIf you choose Remove access and\nthen Stop sharing, well,\n\n282\n00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:21.570\nnow it's no longer shared, right?\n\n283\n00:15:21.570 --> 00:15:25.490\nAnd if we go back over to client2, and\n\n284\n00:15:25.490 --> 00:15:29.895\nwe open up file explorer,\nwe're gonna try to navigate,\n\n285\n00:15:29.895 --> 00:15:34.310\n\\\\client01ProjectData It's just\ngonna sit here and spin and\n\n286\n00:15:34.310 --> 00:15:38.880\neventually give me an error because\nI have taken away the availability\n\n287\n00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:41.000\nto the network over that folder.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\n\n288\n00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.890\nthat was, I don't wanna say instantaneous\nbecause seldomly things are but\n\n289\n00:15:44.890 --> 00:15:50.090\nit was pretty quick and I mean,\nwhen you're thinking about removing or\n\n290\n00:15:50.090 --> 00:15:53.540\ntaking back that access.\n\n291\n00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:55.680\nThis is important to know\nhow long something takes,\n\n292\n00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:59.400\nbecause maybe Titus was let go\nwith the company or something.\n\n293\n00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:02.953\nAnd you don't want him stealing\nany kind of information, whatever.\n\n294\n00:16:02.953 --> 00:16:06.868\nBut understanding how long each of\nthese processes takes can sometimes be\n\n295\n00:16:06.868 --> 00:16:08.012\nbeneficial as well.\n\n296\n00:16:08.012 --> 00:16:09.377\nAnd I noticed Titus popped his head up.\n\n297\n00:16:09.377 --> 00:16:10.311\nAs soon as you said that,\nhe got a little worried.\n\n298\n00:16:10.311 --> 00:16:11.270\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n299\n00:16:11.270 --> 00:16:11.823\n&gt;&gt; Wait, what?\n\n300\n00:16:11.823 --> 00:16:13.627\nNo longer with the company?\n\n301\n00:16:13.627 --> 00:16:15.260\nBut yeah, you're exactly right.\n\n302\n00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:18.963\nAnd this is something that,\nif Titus already had that folder opened,\n\n303\n00:16:18.963 --> 00:16:21.997\nit might have given him access for\na little while longer.\n\n304\n00:16:21.997 --> 00:16:25.605\nAs soon as he closed it and\ntried to reconnect to it though,\n\n305\n00:16:25.605 --> 00:16:29.080\nhe's not gonna be able to,\ncuz we've taken that away.\n\n306\n00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:30.620\nAll right.\n\n307\n00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:35.760\nAnd let's take a look at\nthe other sharing method.\n\n308\n00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:40.920\nI'm gonna right-click on project data\nagain, and I'm gonna choose Properties.\n\n309\n00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:43.320\nNow I just showed you this Give access to.\n\n310\n00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:47.220\nRemember that does get me to that\nsimple basic sharing wizard.\n\n311\n00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:50.780\nSo rather than go Properties and\nthen Sharing and\n\n312\n00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:55.330\nthen Share and launching this little\nwizard, another way to get to that\n\n313\n00:16:55.330 --> 00:17:00.074\nbasic sharing is just to right-click\nGive access to, Specific people.\n\n314\n00:17:00.074 --> 00:17:03.450\nAnd that will open up that same wizard and\nallow me to go through\n\n315\n00:17:03.450 --> 00:17:07.520\nthe process of adding everyone or\nwhomever I wanted to share that with.\n\n316\n00:17:08.870 --> 00:17:09.790\nBut that's not what we wanna do.\n\n317\n00:17:09.790 --> 00:17:11.660\nWe wanna look at advanced sharing.\n\n318\n00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:15.690\nWe're gonna right-click on that\nproject data and go to Properties.\n\n319\n00:17:15.690 --> 00:17:19.390\nThen I'm gonna go to the Sharing tab, and\nthis time we're gonna take a look at this\n\n320\n00:17:19.390 --> 00:17:22.080\nother button down here,\nthe Advanced Sharing.\n\n321\n00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:26.010\nYou see it says set custom permissions,\ncreate multiple shares,\n\n322\n00:17:26.010 --> 00:17:29.160\nset other advanced sharing options.\n\n323\n00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:32.060\nSo, again, if you're old school,\nthis is what we used to use.\n\n324\n00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:34.040\nThere was no basic sharing wizard.\n\n325\n00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:36.070\nThis is the only way we had to share.\n\n326\n00:17:36.070 --> 00:17:39.700\nNow it's known as advanced sharing,\nso just remember that for the exam.\n\n327\n00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:43.250\nSo I right-clicked on it,\nclicked Advanced Sharing.\n\n328\n00:17:43.250 --> 00:17:45.050\nThis little window pops up.\n\n329\n00:17:45.050 --> 00:17:48.670\nAnd you see there's a check mark here for\nShare this folder.\n\n330\n00:17:48.670 --> 00:17:54.490\nAnd I can check Share this folder, and you\nsee the rest of my options now light up.\n\n331\n00:17:54.490 --> 00:17:56.810\nAnd the first thing I see is Share name.\n\n332\n00:17:56.810 --> 00:18:00.670\nI can actually change\nthe name of the share.\n\n333\n00:18:00.670 --> 00:18:06.270\nWhat if the folder was named project data\n\n334\n00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:13.190\nphase one, March 2018, you know,\nsome crazy long folder name.\n\n335\n00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:17.990\nRemember what the UNC path is,\n\\\\computername\\sharename.\n\n336\n00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:20.690\nSo if that sharename was really,\nreally long-\n\n337\n00:18:20.690 --> 00:18:22.350\n&gt;&gt; Cherokee might not remember everything?\n\n338\n00:18:22.350 --> 00:18:23.770\n&gt;&gt; Cherokee might not remember all\n\n339\n00:18:23.770 --> 00:18:24.470\nof that, right?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n340\n00:18:24.470 --> 00:18:25.710\n&gt;&gt; Well what if it was cryptic names?\n\n341\n00:18:25.710 --> 00:18:29.530\nYou know how sometimes these network\nadmins, server admins, might make a folder\n\n342\n00:18:29.530 --> 00:18:34.484\ncalled called p data, some cryptic code.\n&gt;&gt; v1.67.\n\n343\n00:18:34.484 --> 00:18:35.444\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\n\n344\n00:18:35.444 --> 00:18:40.745\nI gotta try to remember that\nto be able to connect to it.\n\n345\n00:18:40.745 --> 00:18:44.675\nIt might be tricky, but\nI can simply change the name of it.\n\n346\n00:18:44.675 --> 00:18:48.035\nSpaces sometimes cause a problem\ndepending on how you're connecting.\n\n347\n00:18:48.035 --> 00:18:49.405\nYou might have to put quotes around.\n\n348\n00:18:49.405 --> 00:18:53.740\nSo I could simply change this to Data,\nright?\n\n349\n00:18:55.570 --> 00:18:57.368\nWhich would then share it out as Data.\n\n350\n00:18:57.368 --> 00:19:00.220\nThat's not gonna change\nthe name of the folder, but\n\n351\n00:19:00.220 --> 00:19:03.920\nthat is gonna change the UNC\npath to connect to this folder.\n\n352\n00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:06.110\nI could call this one bob.\n\n353\n00:19:06.110 --> 00:19:09.690\nEven though it's called project\ndata I could share it out as bob.\n\n354\n00:19:09.690 --> 00:19:14.380\nAnd then you would type in \\\\client01\\bob.\n\n355\n00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:17.010\nSo that's the first thing,\nthe Advanced Sharing Wizard or\n\n356\n00:19:17.010 --> 00:19:21.240\nthe Advanced Sharing option gives me\nthe ability to change the share name,\n\n357\n00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:23.860\nwhich in the basic sharing wizard\nwe didn't have the option to do.\n\n358\n00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:27.830\nYou can't do that,\nagain this is test question type stuff.\n\n359\n00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:31.130\nYour scenario is you need\nto make a share available.\n\n360\n00:19:31.130 --> 00:19:33.860\nThe folder has a very long complex name.\n\n361\n00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:35.160\nYou wanna share it out so\n\n362\n00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:39.913\nthat people can access it by\njust typing in client01\\project.\n\n363\n00:19:39.913 --> 00:19:42.150\nHow would you do that?\n\n364\n00:19:42.150 --> 00:19:43.810\nYou wouldn't use the basic sharing wizard.\n\n365\n00:19:43.810 --> 00:19:48.500\nYou would have to know for the exam, that\nmeans as soon as they said change the name\n\n366\n00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:52.730\nof the share, in your brain you should\nthink, Advanced Sharing Wizard, right?\n\n367\n00:19:52.730 --> 00:19:55.490\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and you know, I haven't shared\n\n368\n00:19:55.490 --> 00:20:00.340\nfolders out like this in a very long time\nbecause of newer, different ways to do it.\n\n369\n00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:05.120\nBut I can recall setting up even for large\namounts of data that were being shared,\n\n370\n00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:08.080\nlike an entire volume\nthat could be shared out.\n\n371\n00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:12.490\nAnd one of the things that was just, I\ndon't know if you ever did this, Mike, but\n\n372\n00:20:12.490 --> 00:20:15.350\nit was kind of common to pick the letter.\n\n373\n00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:18.240\nIf that letter was available,\nif it associated with the name,\n\n374\n00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:22.570\nlike maybe do an s for sales or\n\n375\n00:20:22.570 --> 00:20:24.795\nsomething like that, if that makes sense.\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n376\n00:20:24.795 --> 00:20:27.930\nyeah, like we do this pd for project data.\n\n377\n00:20:27.930 --> 00:20:31.230\nIt would be something very simple and\neasy for people to remember.\n\n378\n00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:33.380\nAnd that's the idea behind this.\n\n379\n00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:40.210\nIt gives you the ability to create\nreally easy to remember type UNC paths.\n\n380\n00:20:40.210 --> 00:20:43.460\nAnd the key I want you to remember here\nis you can't do that through the basic\n\n381\n00:20:43.460 --> 00:20:43.972\nsharing wizard.\n\n382\n00:20:43.972 --> 00:20:47.730\nSo you have to do that\nthrough Advanced Sharing.\n\n383\n00:20:47.730 --> 00:20:50.750\nThe other thing, and let me just\ncancel this out real quick, and\n\n384\n00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:54.098\ndo that one more time cuz I don't\nwanna change the name of it just yet.\n\n385\n00:20:54.098 --> 00:20:57.390\nSo I'm gonna leave it as Project Data\ncuz I want to show you something else\n\n386\n00:20:57.390 --> 00:20:57.950\nthat we can do.\n\n387\n00:20:57.950 --> 00:21:01.220\nWe'll come wrap back\naround to the share name.\n\n388\n00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:03.860\nSo I can change the share name,\nthat's cool.\n\n389\n00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:07.375\nI also have Limit the number\nof simultaneous users to, and\n\n390\n00:21:07.375 --> 00:21:10.310\nthen it defaults to the value of 20.\n\n391\n00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:15.710\nI can control how many people can\nconnect at the same time to the share.\n\n392\n00:21:15.710 --> 00:21:19.600\nIf I'm in an organization that has\na thousand users in there, and\n\n393\n00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:24.430\nI've made this new company phone book and\nI decide to share it out, and\n\n394\n00:21:24.430 --> 00:21:29.010\nI have a lot of people now connecting\nto that, all of a sudden, I can get so\n\n395\n00:21:29.010 --> 00:21:31.860\nmany connections that my\nmachine starts to slow down.\n\n396\n00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:34.329\nYeah, because there's too many\npeople connecting to my machine,\n\n397\n00:21:34.329 --> 00:21:36.681\ntrying to access that really cool\nspreadsheet that I just made.\n\n398\n00:21:36.681 --> 00:21:38.218\n&gt;&gt; So essentially like a friendly denial\n\n399\n00:21:38.218 --> 00:21:40.270\nof service on your own machine?\n&gt;&gt; Yes, so\n\n400\n00:21:40.270 --> 00:21:42.100\nwhat I can do is I can limit, look,\n\n401\n00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:46.250\nas soon as more than 20 people connect to\nmy machine, I can't get anything done.\n\n402\n00:21:46.250 --> 00:21:47.960\nI'm trying to do other things,\n\n403\n00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:51.050\neverybody else is connecting to my\nspreadsheet that I've shared out, and\n\n404\n00:21:51.050 --> 00:21:55.750\nit's making my machine go slow, or it's\nmaking my network connectivity slow down.\n\n405\n00:21:55.750 --> 00:21:57.320\nSo I could adjust this number.\n\n406\n00:21:57.320 --> 00:22:00.820\nI could drop it down or I could\nraise it up and say, you know what,\n\n407\n00:22:00.820 --> 00:22:04.020\nmy machine's beefy and I know a lot\nof people need access to this.\n\n408\n00:22:04.020 --> 00:22:04.750\nLet me change that,\n\n409\n00:22:04.750 --> 00:22:08.880\nbut the point is this is where you control\nhow many simultaneous connections.\n\n410\n00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:12.040\nIt's not how many people\ncan connect over time.\n\n411\n00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:15.660\nAt one particular time,\nhow many people can be connected?\n\n412\n00:22:15.660 --> 00:22:20.080\nAgain, this is an option that you cannot\nchange with the basic sharing wizard,\n\n413\n00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:21.592\nonly through the Advanced Sharing.\n\n414\n00:22:21.592 --> 00:22:24.520\nAll right, down below that,\n\n415\n00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:27.170\nI have comments, kinda probably\ndoesn't need an explanation.\n\n416\n00:22:27.170 --> 00:22:29.110\nI can put in here, hey this is data for\n\n417\n00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:31.850\nproject x,\nto be shared amongst our entire team.\n\n418\n00:22:31.850 --> 00:22:34.310\nYou know,\nput some kind of comment in there.\n\n419\n00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:38.190\nBelow that I have Permissions and Caching.\n\n420\n00:22:38.190 --> 00:22:40.520\nSo let's click Permissions.\n\n421\n00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:45.410\nAnd I can see by default everyone\nis gonna be given Read permission.\n\n422\n00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:52.720\nWe can leave that or we can change that,\nobviously and remove that,\n\n423\n00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:56.470\nmake changes to this, but this is\nagain another test question, right?\n\n424\n00:22:56.470 --> 00:23:02.580\nThat is the default share, everyone reads,\nso it's a good one to remember, all right?\n\n425\n00:23:03.950 --> 00:23:05.790\nWell, I'm just gonna go ahead and\nleave the default.\n\n426\n00:23:05.790 --> 00:23:09.360\nI'm gonna zoom back out so I can see all\nmy buttons and I'll go ahead and click OK.\n\n427\n00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:14.690\nAll right, and\nnow let's look at the Caching options.\n\n428\n00:23:16.210 --> 00:23:20.570\nAnd on the Caching,\nwe have three options here.\n\n429\n00:23:20.570 --> 00:23:22.220\nThis has to do with offline files.\n\n430\n00:23:22.220 --> 00:23:25.280\nWe've talked about this in\nour offline files episode, so\n\n431\n00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:26.830\nmake sure you go back and check that out.\n\n432\n00:23:26.830 --> 00:23:30.364\nI won't go over it again, but\nwhat I do wanna point out is this is\n\n433\n00:23:30.364 --> 00:23:35.060\navailable through the Advanced Sharing,\nnot through the basic sharing.\n\n434\n00:23:35.060 --> 00:23:38.420\nI'm gonna cancel a lot of that and\nthen jump back over to Permissions.\n\n435\n00:23:38.420 --> 00:23:42.354\nAnd you'll see that the Permissions\nare a little bit different.\n\n436\n00:23:42.354 --> 00:23:47.870\nWhen we did the basic sharing we saw\nRead or Read-Write, and that was it.\n\n437\n00:23:47.870 --> 00:23:48.393\nIt was Owner.\n\n438\n00:23:48.393 --> 00:23:51.360\nI was also listed there because I\nwas the one that shared it out.\n\n439\n00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:54.350\nHere I have Full Control, Change and Read.\n\n440\n00:23:54.350 --> 00:23:59.060\nSo they're worded a little differently,\nbut the permissions are really the same.\n\n441\n00:23:59.060 --> 00:24:01.346\nRead is gonna give\nsomebody just read access.\n\n442\n00:24:01.346 --> 00:24:03.703\nThey can open up the documents\ninside the share.\n\n443\n00:24:03.703 --> 00:24:06.390\nThey can read them, but\nthey can't make changes to them and\n\n444\n00:24:06.390 --> 00:24:08.014\nthey can't delete the documents.\n\n445\n00:24:08.014 --> 00:24:13.510\nChange is kind of like the read-write\nfrom the basic sharing wizard.\n\n446\n00:24:13.510 --> 00:24:17.020\nNow you have the ability to read,\nas well as to write and\n\n447\n00:24:17.020 --> 00:24:19.440\nmake changes to existing documents.\n\n448\n00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:23.402\nFull Control would let you delete things,\ncreate new documents.\n\n449\n00:24:23.402 --> 00:24:26.670\nChange would actually let you\ncreate new documents as well.\n\n450\n00:24:26.670 --> 00:24:30.558\nAll right, so the permissions\nare worded slightly different,\n\n451\n00:24:30.558 --> 00:24:32.940\nbut in the end, they do the same thing.\n\n452\n00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:38.030\nIt's just change versus read-write\nin the basic wizard, all right?\n\n453\n00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:42.581\nNow, another thing that we're gonna have\nto deal with here is something known\n\n454\n00:24:42.581 --> 00:24:43.548\nas NTFS permissions.\n\n455\n00:24:43.548 --> 00:24:44.940\nI'm not gonna go into this just yet.\n\n456\n00:24:44.940 --> 00:24:50.420\nWe've got episodes in this show\nthat will cover NTFS permissions.\n\n457\n00:24:50.420 --> 00:24:55.536\nBut I do need to point out at this time\nthat the basic sharing wizard hid,\n\n458\n00:24:55.536 --> 00:25:01.220\nI think we mentioned, hid some of\nthe complexity of working with shares.\n\n459\n00:25:01.220 --> 00:25:05.000\nBecause when it comes down to it, there's\ntwo different permissions that I need to\n\n460\n00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:07.490\naccess a resource when I'm\ngoing across the network.\n\n461\n00:25:07.490 --> 00:25:12.800\nMy share permissions and my NTFS\npermissions, my file system permissions.\n\n462\n00:25:13.990 --> 00:25:17.798\nIf I give you share permissions but\nI don't give you NTFS permissions,\n\n463\n00:25:17.798 --> 00:25:20.922\nyou're not gonna get access\nto the resource, all right?\n\n464\n00:25:20.922 --> 00:25:24.805\nAnd, again, we'll cover this\nin much more detail as we go.\n\n465\n00:25:24.805 --> 00:25:28.874\nBut you might be thinking to yourself\nthen, well, Mike, when you shared it out\n\n466\n00:25:28.874 --> 00:25:32.424\nusing the basic wizard I didn't see\nyou mess with NTFS permissions.\n\n467\n00:25:32.424 --> 00:25:34.228\nAll you did was share permissions.\n\n468\n00:25:34.228 --> 00:25:37.020\nAnd that's one of the thing the basic\nsharing wizard does for us.\n\n469\n00:25:37.020 --> 00:25:41.890\nIs it takes whatever you've set as\nfar as share permissions and says,\n\n470\n00:25:41.890 --> 00:25:44.620\nokay, let me do the same thing\nwith the NTFS permissions.\n\n471\n00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:47.910\nAgain, it's making it easy for\nthe end user that doesn't understand.\n\n472\n00:25:47.910 --> 00:25:51.250\nThey haven't taken their Microsoft exams.\n\n473\n00:25:51.250 --> 00:25:52.968\nThey haven't gone through these classes.\n\n474\n00:25:52.968 --> 00:25:56.690\nAnd they don't know what NTFS permissions\nare and share permissions are.\n\n475\n00:25:56.690 --> 00:26:00.296\nWhen they wanna share something out they\njust wanna go click, click, hey, Cherokee,\n\n476\n00:26:00.296 --> 00:26:02.404\nyou should have access to that,\nand you're done.\n\n477\n00:26:02.404 --> 00:26:05.789\nAll right, well, what the wizard\nis doing is saying, all right,\n\n478\n00:26:05.789 --> 00:26:09.476\nyou gave them read share, I'll go\nahead and give them read NTFS for you,\n\n479\n00:26:09.476 --> 00:26:11.662\nbecause that's probably what you meant.\n\n480\n00:26:11.662 --> 00:26:16.064\nOr if you gave them read, write, share in\nthat basic wizard, I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n481\n00:26:16.064 --> 00:26:18.110\ngive them modified permissions NTFS.\n\n482\n00:26:18.110 --> 00:26:21.210\nBecause that's probably what you meant,\nright?\n\n483\n00:26:21.210 --> 00:26:26.450\nThe Advanced Sharing wizard or Advanced\nSharing option doesn't do that for us.\n\n484\n00:26:26.450 --> 00:26:31.400\nIf I come in here and\ngive everyone Read permission, all right?\n\n485\n00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:34.175\nAnd actually, let's add somebody,\nlet's add Titus.\n\n486\n00:26:37.078 --> 00:26:43.498\nAnd let me give Titus Change permissions,\nand let's click OK.\n\n487\n00:26:43.498 --> 00:26:47.010\nAll right, and then I'll click OK on here.\n\n488\n00:26:47.010 --> 00:26:50.032\nAll right, well,\nif we go over to the Security tab,\n\n489\n00:26:50.032 --> 00:26:52.990\nwe'll see that Titus is not in this list.\n\n490\n00:26:52.990 --> 00:26:58.067\nSo if I wanna use this Advanced Sharing,\nI've got to assign the share permissions.\n\n491\n00:26:58.067 --> 00:27:01.748\nBut I also have to assign\nthe matching NTFS permissions,\n\n492\n00:27:01.748 --> 00:27:03.530\nor whatever I choose to do.\n\n493\n00:27:03.530 --> 00:27:05.785\nSo I wanna make sure you\nguys are clear on that.\n\n494\n00:27:05.785 --> 00:27:08.311\nThat if you do the Advanced Sharing,\n\n495\n00:27:08.311 --> 00:27:11.742\nyou are not done when you click Share,\nall right?\n\n496\n00:27:11.742 --> 00:27:16.762\nYou still need to set the appropriate NTFS\npermissions or check on those as well.\n\n497\n00:27:16.762 --> 00:27:22.750\nAnd again, we'll come back around to that\nas we get to those NTFS permissions.\n\n498\n00:27:22.750 --> 00:27:26.350\nAll right, I wanna click\nAdvanced Sharing one more time.\n\n499\n00:27:26.350 --> 00:27:30.740\nNow that I've shared this out, you look\nat this, oops, you look at this name.\n\n500\n00:27:30.740 --> 00:27:31.650\nWhat did I just do?\n\n501\n00:27:31.650 --> 00:27:33.619\nI started a timer, great.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n502\n00:27:33.619 --> 00:27:34.850\n&gt;&gt; We don't want a timer.\n\n503\n00:27:34.850 --> 00:27:37.412\nA little keyboard shortcut mishap there.\n\n504\n00:27:37.412 --> 00:27:42.393\nI'm gonna zoom in, and remember I said\nwe're gonna leave the name Project Data,\n\n505\n00:27:42.393 --> 00:27:45.010\nbut notice I now have an Add button.\n\n506\n00:27:45.010 --> 00:27:47.250\nThis was grayed out before.\n\n507\n00:27:47.250 --> 00:27:53.040\nI can come back in and add additional\nshare names to the same share, all right?\n\n508\n00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:58.990\nMaybe this used to be known as Project x,\nand now it's Project Data.\n\n509\n00:27:58.990 --> 00:28:00.920\nSome people still remember Project x.\n\n510\n00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:08.357\nSo I can come in here, And\nadd Project x as a share.\n\n511\n00:28:08.357 --> 00:28:12.830\nI can even set different permissions\nbased on what name you use to connect to\n\n512\n00:28:12.830 --> 00:28:13.960\nthe share.\n\n513\n00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:18.930\nBut I'll click OK, and\nnow it's shared twice in a way, right?\n\n514\n00:28:18.930 --> 00:28:21.512\nIt's shared as Project Data and Project x.\n\n515\n00:28:21.512 --> 00:28:22.816\nAnd Cherokee said, you know what,\n\n516\n00:28:22.816 --> 00:28:25.522\nwe really should just call it PD cuz\nthat's gonna be easier for everyone.\n\n517\n00:28:25.522 --> 00:28:28.653\nSo I can click add, I can do PD,\nand I can click OK.\n\n518\n00:28:28.653 --> 00:28:30.180\n&gt;&gt; So accommodating, Mike.\n\n519\n00:28:30.180 --> 00:28:31.745\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, thank you, I try to be,\n\n520\n00:28:31.745 --> 00:28:33.019\nthat's what we do in IT.\n\n521\n00:28:33.019 --> 00:28:34.094\nWe try to help our users.\n\n522\n00:28:34.094 --> 00:28:36.230\nWe'll click Apply and OK.\n\n523\n00:28:36.230 --> 00:28:41.860\nAnd now you can connect to that\nusing any one of those methods.\n\n524\n00:28:41.860 --> 00:28:42.940\nLet's go test that out.\n\n525\n00:28:42.940 --> 00:28:45.975\nIf I go back over to client two.\n\n526\n00:28:45.975 --> 00:28:48.190\nI think I'm logged in as Titus.\n\n527\n00:28:48.190 --> 00:28:50.300\nAnd you know what,\nI didn't give Titus permissions.\n\n528\n00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:55.069\nLet me set the NTFS permissions\nreal quick so everything will work.\n\n529\n00:28:55.069 --> 00:29:03.590\nAnd, again, we'll talk about the NTFS\npermissions in a separate episode.\n\n530\n00:29:03.590 --> 00:29:07.650\nSo I'm just gonna give him\nModify permissions there,\n\n531\n00:29:07.650 --> 00:29:08.664\njust to make that work, right?\n\n532\n00:29:10.350 --> 00:29:13.150\nSo back over to client two.\n\n533\n00:29:13.150 --> 00:29:19.870\nAnd Titus comes to his machine, \\\\client01\nand he can connect to Project Data.\n\n534\n00:29:19.870 --> 00:29:24.426\nSo just like using the basic sharing\nwizard, the end results are the same,\n\n535\n00:29:24.426 --> 00:29:24.940\nright?\n\n536\n00:29:24.940 --> 00:29:26.631\nI can see that he can connect to it.\n\n537\n00:29:26.631 --> 00:29:31.732\nBut I could also do \\\\client01\\pd and\n\n538\n00:29:31.732 --> 00:29:35.770\nconnect to that same folder.\n\n539\n00:29:35.770 --> 00:29:42.660\nOr I could use the old name,\nprojectx, and still connect to that.\n\n540\n00:29:42.660 --> 00:29:45.230\nSo the ability to give\na share multiple names is\n\n541\n00:29:45.230 --> 00:29:47.400\nonly available in that\nAdvanced Sharing wizard.\n\n542\n00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:49.850\nAnd you think, well, that's silly.\n\n543\n00:29:49.850 --> 00:29:54.370\nWe've given you one example, like a nice\nshort name that's easier to remember.\n\n544\n00:29:54.370 --> 00:29:59.460\nAnother thing is, what if people\nhad mapped drives to that share\n\n545\n00:29:59.460 --> 00:30:04.720\nunder the old name and now you wanna\nchange the name of that folder?\n\n546\n00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:06.870\nYou can end up breaking things, right?\n\n547\n00:30:06.870 --> 00:30:11.659\nSo if I can share it using multiple names,\nI can allow those maps to still continue\n\n548\n00:30:11.659 --> 00:30:16.183\nto function with a share, even though\nI've changed the name of that share.\n\n549\n00:30:16.183 --> 00:30:18.823\nAll right, so\nthat's a look at the Advanced Sharing.\n\n550\n00:30:18.823 --> 00:30:22.040\nAgain, we've got a lot more to talk\nabout when it comes to sharing.\n\n551\n00:30:22.040 --> 00:30:26.600\nAnd as we bring in NTFS\npermissions as well.\n\n552\n00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:28.216\nBut I think it's probably a good place for\n\n553\n00:30:28.216 --> 00:30:31.060\nus, Cherokee, to stop for this one.\n&gt;&gt; Great, thank you so much for\n\n554\n00:30:31.060 --> 00:30:31.940\nthat information, Mike.\n\n555\n00:30:31.940 --> 00:30:33.670\nAnd thank you for joining us as well.\n\n556\n00:30:33.670 --> 00:30:36.690\nBut we are gonna come back with\na part three for this topic.\n\n557\n00:30:36.690 --> 00:30:37.830\nSo we're gonna sign out now.\n\n558\n00:30:37.830 --> 00:30:40.100\nI've been your host, Cherokee Boose.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n559\n00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:43.310\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n560\n00:30:43.310 --> 00:30:49.292\n[MUSIC]\n\n561\n00:30:49.292 --> 00:30:52.348\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for

You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:11.635 --> 00:00:15.565\n&gt;&gt; Welcome everyone to your Configuring\nWindows Devices Series, I'm your host,\n\n7\n00:00:15.565 --> 00:00:16.441\nCherokee Boose.\n\n8\n00:00:16.441 --> 00:00:21.880\nIn this episode, we'll continue taking a\nlook at how to configure shared resources.\n\n9\n00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.240\nWe are here to part three and, of course,\n\n10\n00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.610\nwe have Mr Mike Rodrick back in studios\nto guide us through this topic.\n\n11\n00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:29.708\nHow's it going today Mike?\n\n12\n00:00:29.708 --> 00:00:32.338\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic Cherokee, thanks for\nhaving me back, excited as always.\n\n13\n00:00:32.338 --> 00:00:32.956\n&gt;&gt; Of course.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n14\n00:00:32.956 --> 00:00:35.010\nwe've got lots of stuff\nto talk about today.\n\n15\n00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.090\nNow, we've been looking at, as you said,\nconfiguring shared resources and\n\n16\n00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.530\nwe've seen a couple of different ways\nwe can do that In Windows 10, right?\n\n17\n00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.820\nWe saw the public folder sharing options.\n\n18\n00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.690\nWe looked at the basic Sharing Wizard,\nthe advanced Sharing Wizard.\n\n19\n00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.270\nSo different ways that I could make\nresources available to my co-workers\n\n20\n00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:53.920\nfrom my Windows 10 device.\n\n21\n00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.170\nI wanna show you one more share method,\nwell, really a few more things,\n\n22\n00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.580\nthat all have to do with shares.\n\n23\n00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:03.230\nBut I wanted to show you how to\ncreate a share from PowerShell.\n\n24\n00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.880\nBecause we know PowerShell is\nthe administrative tool of choice, not so\n\n25\n00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.990\nmuch for end users maybe.\n\n26\n00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.920\nBut on this exam there's a good chance\nthey can throw in PowerShell questions.\n\n27\n00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.230\nSo let's make sure we\ncover all of our bases.\n\n28\n00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:17.447\nSo let's join me here on my screen.\n\n29\n00:01:17.447 --> 00:01:20.474\nIf you remember from previous\nepisode on my second drive or\n\n30\n00:01:20.474 --> 00:01:24.160\nmy other volume here I've got\na folder called Project Data.\n\n31\n00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:28.510\nWe had shared that out using the different\nmethods I talked about just a second ago.\n\n32\n00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:33.080\nI went and unshared it, so we can see\nnow that it is no longer shared so\n\n33\n00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.670\nthat we could do this again\nthrough PowerShell, right?\n\n34\n00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:38.610\nI'll just leave that minimized here.\n\n35\n00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.820\nI am gonna fire up PowerShell\nas an administrator.\n\n36\n00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:42.880\nRemember what we talked about,\n\n37\n00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.850\nyou need to be an administrator on\nthe local machine, to create a share.\n\n38\n00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.580\nIt doesn't change just because\nyou are using Power Shelf, so\n\n39\n00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:51.760\nyou still need those\nadministrative rights.\n\n40\n00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:57.188\nThe command is pretty straightforward,\nit's gonna be new -SMB share.\n\n41\n00:01:57.188 --> 00:01:59.920\nAll right, new-SMBShare.\n\n42\n00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.600\nAnd then there's two required parameters.\n\n43\n00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.560\nThere's a lot of other\nparameters that I can use\n\n44\n00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.150\nto modify some of\nthe properties of this share.\n\n45\n00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:08.900\nKind of like when we went into the GUI,\nand\n\n46\n00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:12.540\nwe took a look at some of the advanced\ncaching options, things like that.\n\n47\n00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.250\nYou can set all those through PowerShell,\nand\n\n48\n00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:19.235\nit would behoove you to do\na git-help new-SMBShare or go out to\n\n49\n00:02:19.235 --> 00:02:23.490\ndocs.microsoft.com and take a look at\nsome of those different parameters.\n\n50\n00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:27.990\nBut I think on the exam it's probably just\ngonna be mainly making sure you know,\n\n51\n00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.600\nwhat command would be used\nto create a new share.\n\n52\n00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.565\nAnd the only required parameters\nare gonna be a dash name.\n\n53\n00:02:33.565 --> 00:02:35.980\n&gt;&gt; Has to know what we're sharing, right?\n\n54\n00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.930\n&gt;&gt; Well this is what we're calling it,\nright?\n\n55\n00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.798\nSo this is like kinda when we're in\nthe share we said even though the folder's\n\n56\n00:02:41.798 --> 00:02:42.937\nname is Project Data.\n\n57\n00:02:42.937 --> 00:02:45.588\nWe could name it PD for short,\nlike you were talking about,\n\n58\n00:02:45.588 --> 00:02:46.873\nyou know those short names.\n\n59\n00:02:46.873 --> 00:02:49.085\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, like P Diddy.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n60\n00:02:49.085 --> 00:02:51.778\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So we can name this [LAUGH] whatever we\n\n61\n00:02:51.778 --> 00:02:55.988\nwant, if we wanna name it Cool Hand Luke,\nI guess we could do it that.\n\n62\n00:02:55.988 --> 00:02:59.660\nBut remember, we can shorten up\nthose names, make it easier for\n\n63\n00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.205\nour users to remember,\nespecially if they're crazy names.\n\n64\n00:03:04.255 --> 00:03:05.105\n&gt;&gt; Really long ones?\n\n65\n00:03:05.105 --> 00:03:09.045\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, cryptic names that maybe\ninclude dates, things like that.\n\n66\n00:03:09.045 --> 00:03:13.015\nOr maybe the share used to be known as\nsomething else, it's now shared out as\n\n67\n00:03:13.015 --> 00:03:16.650\na different name, but we wanna use that\nold name that people are familiar with.\n\n68\n00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.160\nSo the name could be anything.\n\n69\n00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.614\nIn fact, the folders name was\nProject Data, just to show you,\n\n70\n00:03:21.614 --> 00:03:23.253\nI'm gonna do PD,all right?\n\n71\n00:03:23.253 --> 00:03:27.316\nI am putting it in quotes cuz it is\na string, you could use single quotes or\n\n72\n00:03:27.316 --> 00:03:28.840\ndouble quotes here.\n\n73\n00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.617\nReally wouldn't make\na difference in this case.\n\n74\n00:03:30.617 --> 00:03:33.633\nAnd then -path, and this, Cherokee,\n\n75\n00:03:33.633 --> 00:03:39.057\nis the actual folder that we're\ntrying to share, which would be E:\\.\n\n76\n00:03:39.057 --> 00:03:42.430\nIt's right on the root project data.\n\n77\n00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:43.670\nSo that's all I need.\n\n78\n00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:48.356\nWhat I wanna call the share, and\nwhat I'm actually sharing out, all right?\n\n79\n00:03:48.356 --> 00:03:50.230\nSo we'll hit Enter.\n\n80\n00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:51.680\nAnd if everything goes well,\n\n81\n00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:57.240\nI'll have a new share called PD\nthat point to e:projectdata.\n\n82\n00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:02.388\nAnd now if I go over to another machine,\nopen up file explorer,\n\n83\n00:04:02.388 --> 00:04:09.205\nand navigate to name of the computer,\nclient01/PD, and there's that share.\n\n84\n00:04:09.205 --> 00:04:10.934\n&gt;&gt; Pretty cool\n&gt;&gt; Yeah very cool, and\n\n85\n00:04:10.934 --> 00:04:12.590\nvery easy to do in the end.\n\n86\n00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:17.267\nAll right, if we take a look at the\nproperties of that folder we'll see that\n\n87\n00:04:17.267 --> 00:04:20.846\nit is indeed now shared out\nas that app there, all right?\n\n88\n00:04:20.846 --> 00:04:26.116\nSo that's PowerShell, that's how we're\ngonna create a share through PowerShell.\n\n89\n00:04:26.116 --> 00:04:27.502\nAll right Cherokee,\n\n90\n00:04:27.502 --> 00:04:32.225\nthe next thing I wanna talk about here\nis something known as homegroups.\n\n91\n00:04:32.225 --> 00:04:36.346\nHomegroups were a pretty\ncool thing back in the day,\n\n92\n00:04:36.346 --> 00:04:42.540\nback in the Windows IX days and maybe\na little bit beyond there getting into XP.\n\n93\n00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:44.780\nWe used to have something\nknown as work groups, right?\n\n94\n00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:47.940\nThat we could use to network some\ncomputers together that weren't in\n\n95\n00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:49.290\na domain environment.\n\n96\n00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:53.752\nBut gave us the ability to kinda access\nresources on other machines on that same\n\n97\n00:04:53.752 --> 00:04:54.370\nnetwork.\n\n98\n00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:56.370\nBut it was kind of a pain.\n\n99\n00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:00.630\nYou had to make sure that each user\nhad an account on each machine so\n\n100\n00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:03.405\nthat they can access those resources\non the different machines.\n\n101\n00:05:03.405 --> 00:05:07.210\nHomegroups kinda simplified\nthat whole process.\n\n102\n00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:12.490\nIt gave you the ability to share\nresources amongst my computers\n\n103\n00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:17.940\non a local area network without having\nto create accounts for everybody.\n\n104\n00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:19.570\nIt creates this homegroup.\n\n105\n00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:22.371\nAnd this homegroup then,\nwhen you join the homegroup,\n\n106\n00:05:22.371 --> 00:05:26.770\nyou get access to everything that's being\nmade available through that homegroup.\n\n107\n00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:31.060\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so everything that's being made\navailable, what are you talking here,\n\n108\n00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:31.730\nlike documents?\n\n109\n00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:33.200\n&gt;&gt; Yeah if you think about your household.\n\n110\n00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.450\nHow many of you have household\nwith more than one computer?\n\n111\n00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:40.510\nMaybe your spouse and your kids, or\njust you have multiple computers.\n\n112\n00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:45.074\nLike I have my desktop in my office, I\nhave my laptop that I sit on my couch and\n\n113\n00:05:45.074 --> 00:05:48.413\nI can't be troubled to get up and\nwalk into the office.\n\n114\n00:05:48.413 --> 00:05:49.447\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] No, of course not, Mike.\n\n115\n00:05:49.447 --> 00:05:51.940\n&gt;&gt; To get to that file I need.\n\n116\n00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:54.962\nI want to be able to get to it from\nthe couch, it's a lot easier that way.\n\n117\n00:05:54.962 --> 00:05:59.288\nBut you know, I might have pictures that\nI want my kids to be able to access, and\n\n118\n00:05:59.288 --> 00:06:02.720\nthis is a way we can do that,\nmake those resources available.\n\n119\n00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:07.506\nBefore we go any further, I do need\nto go ahead and point out, though,\n\n120\n00:06:07.506 --> 00:06:10.098\nif you started looking at\nMicrosoft's documentation,\n\n121\n00:06:10.098 --> 00:06:12.647\nyou'll see that with the next\nrelease of Windows 10.\n\n122\n00:06:12.647 --> 00:06:17.623\nWhich at the time of this shooting,\nis going to be the Spring Creators, or\n\n123\n00:06:17.623 --> 00:06:21.090\n1803,it's supposed to be going away.\n\n124\n00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:24.517\nSo by the time you watch this you might,\nif you've updated your Windows machine,\n\n125\n00:06:24.517 --> 00:06:25.667\nnot see homegroups at all.\n\n126\n00:06:25.667 --> 00:06:27.541\n&gt;&gt; I can't find that feature.\n\n127\n00:06:27.541 --> 00:06:30.051\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It might not be there and if so\n\n128\n00:06:30.051 --> 00:06:31.304\nit's by design.\n\n129\n00:06:31.304 --> 00:06:32.213\nMicrosoft is taking the feature away.\n\n130\n00:06:32.213 --> 00:06:36.220\nWe talked about this before the show,\nCherokee.\n\n131\n00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:43.141\nYou said you used to use homegroups at\none point, but then you switched to.\n\n132\n00:06:43.141 --> 00:06:45.507\n&gt;&gt; In clouds options that I\nhave available to me now, and\n\n133\n00:06:45.507 --> 00:06:48.253\nI think you're gonna talk about\nthat a little bit later yeah?\n\n134\n00:06:48.253 --> 00:06:51.012\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah absolutely Microsoft has their\n\n135\n00:06:51.012 --> 00:06:55.743\nCloud Services, we'll talk about OneDrive,\nand this is where they want users to go.\n\n136\n00:06:55.743 --> 00:06:56.287\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n137\n00:06:56.287 --> 00:06:59.498\n&gt;&gt; That's what they want users to use,\nbecause it's, one,\n\n138\n00:06:59.498 --> 00:07:02.945\nit's built into my operating system,\nit's very easy.\n\n139\n00:07:02.945 --> 00:07:06.515\nI don't have to worry about joining\nmy machines to the homegroup.\n\n140\n00:07:06.515 --> 00:07:08.192\nAll I have to do is email you a link.\n\n141\n00:07:08.192 --> 00:07:11.049\nAnd you can access the file that I've\nmade available through OneDrive and\n\n142\n00:07:11.049 --> 00:07:13.182\nit's available anywhere\nI've got Internet access.\n\n143\n00:07:13.182 --> 00:07:15.016\n&gt;&gt; Right, as long as they have that\nInternet connection, it's super easy.\n\n144\n00:07:15.016 --> 00:07:18.182\n&gt;&gt; Not just from that homegroup.\n\n145\n00:07:18.182 --> 00:07:22.784\nIt's a much better solution, I guess,\nand that's where they're pushing us.\n\n146\n00:07:22.784 --> 00:07:24.147\nSo homegroups is going away.\n\n147\n00:07:24.147 --> 00:07:27.286\nBut it is also an objective\non the 70-697 exam so\n\n148\n00:07:27.286 --> 00:07:32.340\nI want to make sure you're familiar with\nit just in case you see some questions.\n\n149\n00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:37.490\nYou never know how long it takes for these\nchanges to make their way into the exam.\n\n150\n00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:38.470\nSo let's take a look at it here.\n\n151\n00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:42.290\nCouple of things I want to talk about,\nhomegroups, one, I said.\n\n152\n00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:44.450\nI'm gonna go to my start menu and\n\n153\n00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:47.890\nI'm just gonna type in home\ngroup to get this started.\n\n154\n00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:49.775\nThere's a control panel applet.\n\n155\n00:07:49.775 --> 00:07:53.827\nAnd a couple things we need to be familiar\nwith that are really good test questions\n\n156\n00:07:53.827 --> 00:07:54.728\nfor homegroups.\n\n157\n00:07:54.728 --> 00:07:55.909\nOne, what are they?\n\n158\n00:07:55.909 --> 00:07:59.800\nShare content on your local network,\nthey are password protected.\n\n159\n00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:03.360\nSo if a friend comes over to my house,\nthey can't just access all of the stuff\n\n160\n00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:08.180\nthat I've shared, they would need the\npassword in order to join that HomeGroup.\n\n161\n00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:11.090\nThere's only one HomeGroup per network, so\n\n162\n00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:14.170\nyou can't go to each machine on your\nnetwork and create a HomeGroup.\n\n163\n00:08:14.170 --> 00:08:17.110\nAnd I'll show you in a minute Windows\nwill check the network detect to\n\n164\n00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:19.750\nsee if there's any HomeGroups\nout there already, and\n\n165\n00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:22.030\nif there is,\nyou won't be able to create another one.\n\n166\n00:08:22.030 --> 00:08:25.510\nYou can join the existing one but you\ncan't create more than one on a network,\n\n167\n00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:30.520\nit does require IPv6 to be able to do\nthis, but that's built into Windows 10.\n\n168\n00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:34.350\nSo unless you've disabled it for\nsome reason, that shouldn't be a problem.\n\n169\n00:08:34.350 --> 00:08:38.290\nIt also requires the network\nbe flagged as private.\n\n170\n00:08:38.290 --> 00:08:42.330\nRemember we've talked about Windows and\nhow it deals with the firewall profiles,\n\n171\n00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:45.910\nof which there's three public,\nprivate, and domain.\n\n172\n00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:48.080\nAnd the first time you\nconnect to a network,\n\n173\n00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:49.970\nif it's a domain it detects\nthat automatically.\n\n174\n00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:54.520\nBut the first time you connect to the\nnetwork at home, or at the coffee shop, or\n\n175\n00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:59.300\nthe airport, you get a choice, you wanna\nmake your computer visible, or not.\n\n176\n00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:02.950\nAnd if you say yes, I wanna make\nmy computer visible to others,\n\n177\n00:09:02.950 --> 00:09:05.880\nyou're saying it's a private network and\nit's a little more trusted, and\n\n178\n00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:07.670\ncertain things are gonna be allowed.\n\n179\n00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:10.400\nWhereas if you flag it as public,\nyou said no,\n\n180\n00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:13.980\nI don't wanna make my computer visible,\nthen we've got a lot tighter restrictions\n\n181\n00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:17.350\non what can be done as far as firewall\nexceptions and things like that.\n\n182\n00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:21.260\nAnd HomeGroups wont work,\nthey're not allowed on a public network,\n\n183\n00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:22.110\nwhich is a good thing, right?\n\n184\n00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:24.760\nWe typically don't go to the coffee\nshop and set up a HomeGroup.\n\n185\n00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:27.490\n&gt;&gt; You kind of want to be more\nrestrictive when you're out in public,\n\n186\n00:09:27.490 --> 00:09:31.350\nso adding that extra layer of security\nis something we usually want.\n\n187\n00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:35.640\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and\nwith a domain base computer, all right,\n\n188\n00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:39.760\nlet's say my laptop is my work computer,\nand I use it when I'm at work,\n\n189\n00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:43.970\nit's part of my domain at work, but I take\nthe laptop home with me in the evenings.\n\n190\n00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:49.060\nSo it's a domain based Windows 10 install,\nor it's part of a domain,\n\n191\n00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:54.400\nyou can join HomeGroups, but\nyou cannot create HomeGroups, right?\n\n192\n00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:57.390\nDoesn't matter if it's enterprise or\nnot, even if it's an enterprise machine\n\n193\n00:09:57.390 --> 00:10:00.890\nat home that's not part of a domain,\nI cant create HomeGroups.\n\n194\n00:10:00.890 --> 00:10:05.180\nBut if that computer is part of a domain,\nit's not allowed to create HomeGroups,\n\n195\n00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:07.460\nit's only allowed to join HomeGroups.\n\n196\n00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:10.540\nAgain, just a really good test\nquestion about hHomeGroups.\n\n197\n00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:12.890\nAll right, so\nlet's take a look at my screen,\n\n198\n00:10:12.890 --> 00:10:15.190\nthis time I swear we'll\nactually do something.\n\n199\n00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:18.290\nSo here is the screen that we pulled\nup when we typed in HomeGroups,\n\n200\n00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:19.880\nand you can see it's already checked.\n\n201\n00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:23.190\nThere is currently no\nHomeGroup on your network,\n\n202\n00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:27.540\nto join a HomeGroup your computer's\nnetwork location must be set to private.\n\n203\n00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:29.880\nNow, you know, for\nsome reason I don't have my little link.\n\n204\n00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:33.600\nMany times you come in here,\nyou'll see a link right below here,\n\n205\n00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:37.730\nwhere I'm kinda pointing with my mouse,\nthat will say change your network\n\n206\n00:10:37.730 --> 00:10:40.880\nlocation, because what this is\ntelling me is, hey, you can't do this.\n\n207\n00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:42.580\nYour network is public, so\n\n208\n00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:46.550\nthat link would take me to where I need to\nbe to change this to a private network.\n\n209\n00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:51.700\nThe links not appearing probably because\nI've tested this out before the show and\n\n210\n00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:53.830\nthen switched in back to public, and\n\n211\n00:10:53.830 --> 00:10:57.390\nso it's just given up on me, it doesn't\nknow what my network is at this point.\n\n212\n00:10:57.390 --> 00:10:58.680\nSo let me show you another way.\n\n213\n00:10:58.680 --> 00:10:59.700\nThat you would go to change that\nyou would go to change that.\n\n214\n00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:04.020\nI'm going to right click down here, right\nbehind my, so if we can go full screen for\n\n215\n00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:08.280\njust a second, I'm just going to right\nclick on my little network icon down here,\n\n216\n00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:10.590\nOpen Network and Internet Settings.\n\n217\n00:11:10.590 --> 00:11:13.670\nOF course,\nthere are several ways you can get here,\n\n218\n00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:17.010\njust happens to be the quickest for\nme, and I like it.\n\n219\n00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:22.400\nI'm going to go to Ethernet,\nI'm gonna select my connection, and\n\n220\n00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:25.410\nI am not able to, you know what?\n\n221\n00:11:25.410 --> 00:11:27.580\nI'm on the wrong machine for HomeGroups.\n\n222\n00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:30.340\nI set all this up and I forgot to switch-\n&gt;&gt; On a domain?\n\n223\n00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:34.510\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, this is a domain-based PC,\nand so it's not gonna work, so let me-\n\n224\n00:11:34.510 --> 00:11:35.920\n&gt;&gt; Well, proves your point there.\n\n225\n00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:37.420\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it does, right?\n\n226\n00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:41.190\nAll right, so let me close that,\ncuz I can't change this to private,\n\n227\n00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:44.040\nbecause it's already detected\nthat it's a domain network and-\n\n228\n00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:45.280\n&gt;&gt; I was just going to ask that, but\n\n229\n00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:46.790\nI'm like,\nI don't know if that would affect it.\n\n230\n00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:48.630\n&gt;&gt; It does.\n&gt;&gt; But now we can see clearly it does.\n\n231\n00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:52.400\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, and that's one of the\nthings, you can change it yourself between\n\n232\n00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:56.650\npublic and private, domain is detected\nautomatically and you can't change that.\n\n233\n00:11:56.650 --> 00:12:00.670\nOtherwise, we could get around all those\ncrazy domain security requirements.\n\n234\n00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:02.940\nAll right, so I'm gonna flip\nover to another machine, and\n\n235\n00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:04.020\nwe will do this again.\n\n236\n00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:06.899\nThis is, you can see if again,\nright behind my head there,\n\n237\n00:12:06.899 --> 00:12:09.968\nit is Windows 10 Enterprise,\nbut it's not part of a domain.\n\n238\n00:12:09.968 --> 00:12:13.669\nSo, I'm going to go to my Start menu,\ntype in HomeGroup again,\n\n239\n00:12:13.669 --> 00:12:16.408\nlaunch that console, and there's my link.\n\n240\n00:12:16.408 --> 00:12:19.442\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n&gt;&gt; Now we know why that link wasn't there.\n\n241\n00:12:19.442 --> 00:12:23.294\nThis computer can not connect to a\nHomeGroup, to create or join a HomeGroup,\n\n242\n00:12:23.294 --> 00:12:26.258\nyour computer's network location\nmust be set to private,\n\n243\n00:12:26.258 --> 00:12:27.818\nand there is that little link.\n\n244\n00:12:27.818 --> 00:12:28.935\n&gt;&gt; Pefect.\n\n245\n00:12:28.935 --> 00:12:33.627\n&gt;&gt; So, this time I will use that link, and\nyou'll see it sends this little fly out,\n\n246\n00:12:33.627 --> 00:12:36.882\nand I can say, yes,\nI want make this a private network.\n\n247\n00:12:36.882 --> 00:12:39.622\nWhere I wanna see are other machines,\nand have them see me.\n\n248\n00:12:39.622 --> 00:12:44.042\nAll right, and as soon as I do that notice\nthe screen has change back here, and\n\n249\n00:12:44.042 --> 00:12:48.802\nit's now searching for HomeGroups on the\nnetwork, because there can be only one,\n\n250\n00:12:48.802 --> 00:12:53.140\nit first has to determine whether or\nnot there are any HomeGroups.\n\n251\n00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:57.105\nSince it didn't find any, I now get\nthe button for create a HomeGroup,\n\n252\n00:12:57.105 --> 00:12:58.570\nso that's what I'll do.\n\n253\n00:12:58.570 --> 00:13:01.415\nI'll click, create a HomeGroups,\nand I'll zoom back out so\n\n254\n00:13:01.415 --> 00:13:04.750\nwe can see the rest of the wizard,\nand here, it's just an intro screen,\n\n255\n00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:06.790\ntelling me what I'm\ngoing to be able to do.\n\n256\n00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:11.191\nI'm going to click Next, and then here's\nthe default settings for a HomeGroup.\n\n257\n00:13:11.191 --> 00:13:15.461\nIf I turn this on, or create this\nHomeGroup, it's gonna share out my\n\n258\n00:13:15.461 --> 00:13:20.631\npictures, my videos, my music, not my\ndocuments, but my printers and devices.\n\n259\n00:13:20.631 --> 00:13:23.954\nSo if I want to change this,\nI want to include documents,\n\n260\n00:13:23.954 --> 00:13:28.525\nI could simply change that to Shared, or\nif I did not want to share my pictures,\n\n261\n00:13:28.525 --> 00:13:30.560\nI could change that to Not Shared.\n\n262\n00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:34.829\nAll of this can be changed after the fact,\nyou are not stuck with any of this,\n\n263\n00:13:34.829 --> 00:13:37.232\nit is just the initial set-up, alright.\n\n264\n00:13:37.232 --> 00:13:41.635\nI'll go ahead and click next, then I'll\nzoom out and you can see what it does,\n\n265\n00:13:41.635 --> 00:13:44.371\nit it paints my screen and\nit creates a password.\n\n266\n00:13:44.371 --> 00:13:47.840\nNow this is the password we will\nneed to join the home group, so\n\n267\n00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:52.120\nanybody that I want to join the home group\nI'm gonna have to give him this password.\n\n268\n00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:54.470\nThey're gonna do the same thing, and\nI'll show you this side in a minute.\n\n269\n00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:58.390\nThey're gonna go into HomeGroups,\nthey'll detect the HomeGroup,\n\n270\n00:13:58.390 --> 00:14:02.260\nthey'll have to enter this password and\nthey should be able to join.\n\n271\n00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:05.560\nYou can print the password and\ninstructions.\n\n272\n00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:09.188\nIf I click on this, it gives me this nice\npretty screen, and I can hand this to\n\n273\n00:14:09.188 --> 00:14:13.040\nsomebody, or tape it to your refrigerator,\ncuz that would be secure.\n\n274\n00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:14.608\nNo, I wouldn't wanna do that.\n\n275\n00:14:14.608 --> 00:14:19.208\n[COUGH] But it's how other people\ncan now join your HomeGroups, and\n\n276\n00:14:19.208 --> 00:14:21.490\nI'm gonna cancel that out.\n\n277\n00:14:21.490 --> 00:14:26.250\nSo I really should write this down cuz\nI'm gonna need it to join the HomeGroup.\n\n278\n00:14:26.250 --> 00:14:27.796\nBut I'm gonna kinda cheat,\n\n279\n00:14:27.796 --> 00:14:31.210\nbecause it's one of the options\nI need to show you anyway, I can\n\n280\n00:14:31.210 --> 00:14:35.480\nchange the password and I can make it to\nsomething a little easier to remember.\n\n281\n00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:37.370\n&gt;&gt; I like that idea,\nI was just trying to think,\n\n282\n00:14:37.370 --> 00:14:39.930\nlook, if this is a HomeGroup, and\nwith that example you gave for\n\n283\n00:14:39.930 --> 00:14:42.830\nthe kids, I'm thinking, where can I put\nthis, the kids will actually check.\n\n284\n00:14:42.830 --> 00:14:45.040\nAnd literally,\naside from the refrigerator,\n\n285\n00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:46.340\nthey're always, if nothing-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n286\n00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:48.070\n&gt;&gt; But yeah, this seems like a good idea,\n\n287\n00:14:48.070 --> 00:14:52.360\nchanging that password to something\na little more, memory friendly.\n\n288\n00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:54.140\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, like a human readable word,\n\n289\n00:14:54.140 --> 00:14:57.260\nrather than random numbers or\ncharacters here.\n\n290\n00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:59.420\nNow, security wise, of course,\nif we wanna go down that route.\n\n291\n00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:02.540\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we're going against everything\nwe normally talk about, Mike, though.\n\n292\n00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:03.125\n&gt;&gt; We are, yeah.\n\n293\n00:15:03.125 --> 00:15:04.216\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n294\n00:15:04.216 --> 00:15:05.160\n&gt;&gt; Make it an easy,\n\n295\n00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:07.910\nhuman readable dictionary word,\nall right, so\n\n296\n00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:12.010\nmaybe we won't go quite that far, but\nremember what this is, all right?\n\n297\n00:15:12.010 --> 00:15:16.650\nThis is a HomeGroup, this is only\navailable on my LAN, at my house, and\n\n298\n00:15:16.650 --> 00:15:19.179\nI have pretty good physical\nsecurity at my house.\n\n299\n00:15:19.179 --> 00:15:23.628\nI'm not worried about a lot of creepy\npeople sitting out in an unmarked car\n\n300\n00:15:23.628 --> 00:15:26.641\noutside, trying to gain\naccess to my network, so\n\n301\n00:15:26.641 --> 00:15:31.020\nI'm okay making this a little less\nsecure than this random string.\n\n302\n00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:35.000\nBut hey, if it's something that you need\nto worry about, or if you're doing this in\n\n303\n00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:39.900\na small business that doesn't\nhave a domain, but wants an easy\n\n304\n00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:43.420\nway to share resources, maybe you use\nHomeGroups as a way to share resources.\n\n305\n00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:44.422\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; In which case,\n\n306\n00:15:44.422 --> 00:15:47.750\nif you've got corporate information\nbeing protected by this password,\n\n307\n00:15:47.750 --> 00:15:50.176\nthen don't use password for\nyour password, right.\n\n308\n00:15:50.176 --> 00:15:54.664\nSo, use common sense with that, but\nI'm going to go ahead and click Finish.\n\n309\n00:15:54.664 --> 00:15:57.974\nIf I had forgot it, and or\nI wanted to print it out again,\n\n310\n00:15:57.974 --> 00:16:02.201\nI can always go back in and choose view or\nprint the home group password,\n\n311\n00:16:02.201 --> 00:16:06.070\nthat takes me right back to\nthat same screen, all right.\n\n312\n00:16:06.070 --> 00:16:09.980\nOr I can click change the password,\nI'll zoom in so you can see that.\n\n313\n00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:11.250\nI can click change the password,\n\n314\n00:16:11.250 --> 00:16:14.250\nright an it says hey,\nare you sure you wanna change that?\n\n315\n00:16:14.250 --> 00:16:15.890\nAnd yes, I do.\n\n316\n00:16:16.970 --> 00:16:20.990\nAnd I'm gonna make this\nsomething really easy for us.\n\n317\n00:16:20.990 --> 00:16:21.724\nAnd I'll click Next.\n\n318\n00:16:25.813 --> 00:16:26.930\nAnd it's that easy.\n\n319\n00:16:26.930 --> 00:16:29.370\nMy password is now changed.\n\n320\n00:16:29.370 --> 00:16:31.900\nThis is also kind of interesting,\nCherokee isn't it?\n\n321\n00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:33.965\nIt doesn't obfuscate the password\nas you're typing it.\n\n322\n00:16:33.965 --> 00:16:35.707\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; It didn't ask me to type it in twice.\n\n323\n00:16:35.707 --> 00:16:38.381\n&gt;&gt; No asterisk or\nanything like that, bubbles, yeah.\n\n324\n00:16:38.381 --> 00:16:39.651\n&gt;&gt; Kinda interesting.\n\n325\n00:16:39.651 --> 00:16:43.297\nBut again, this isn't the high-end\nsecurity environment where we need\n\n326\n00:16:43.297 --> 00:16:45.710\nto worry about a lot that, hopefully.\n\n327\n00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:48.040\nAll right, I'll click finish.\n\n328\n00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:49.610\nSo now I've got this homegroup,\n\n329\n00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:51.980\nremember I told you you can\nchange what you're sharing.\n\n330\n00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:55.096\nSo right here's the link for that, change\nwhat you're sharing with the homegroup.\n\n331\n00:16:55.096 --> 00:17:00.552\nSo if I no longer want to share videos, or\nif I decide I do wanna share my pictures,\n\n332\n00:17:00.552 --> 00:17:06.490\nI can simply open this dialog up, and I\ncan adjust what it is I'm sharing, right.\n\n333\n00:17:06.490 --> 00:17:07.757\nNow it's going through\na little process here.\n\n334\n00:17:07.757 --> 00:17:10.884\nYou can see that little pop-up for\na second or that message,\n\n335\n00:17:10.884 --> 00:17:12.750\nbecause I changed my options.\n\n336\n00:17:12.750 --> 00:17:16.058\nSo it's reconfiguring the homegroup,\nand then as soon as it finishes,\n\n337\n00:17:16.058 --> 00:17:17.752\nI'm right back to this screen here.\n\n338\n00:17:17.752 --> 00:17:22.014\nOne more option down here, allow all\ndevices on this network, such as TVs and\n\n339\n00:17:22.014 --> 00:17:24.930\ngame consoles to play my shared content.\n\n340\n00:17:24.930 --> 00:17:29.450\nSo I can not only create this homegroup,\nbut I can expose my music and my videos to\n\n341\n00:17:29.450 --> 00:17:33.928\nother devices on my network, like a smart\nTV, an XBox, something like that.\n\n342\n00:17:33.928 --> 00:17:34.873\n&gt;&gt; That's pretty nice.\n\n343\n00:17:34.873 --> 00:17:38.714\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and I can stream my videos,\nor play my music from my PC and\n\n344\n00:17:38.714 --> 00:17:42.558\nnot have to worry about moving that\nmedia over to a thumb drive or\n\n345\n00:17:42.558 --> 00:17:44.970\nsomething like that to work with my TV.\n\n346\n00:17:44.970 --> 00:17:46.450\nSo very very cool, there.\n\n347\n00:17:47.850 --> 00:17:50.410\nAll right, so now our homegroup is setup,\n\n348\n00:17:50.410 --> 00:17:53.819\nlet's flip over to another\nmachine on this home network.\n\n349\n00:17:54.990 --> 00:17:57.355\nAnd I'm going to type in a homegroup.\n\n350\n00:17:59.757 --> 00:18:04.403\nAnd here we see that same message,\nto create or join a home group,\n\n351\n00:18:04.403 --> 00:18:06.670\nit must be set to private.\n\n352\n00:18:06.670 --> 00:18:10.340\nLast time I clicked this link,\na little slide out came from the side and\n\n353\n00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:11.820\nI was able to change that.\n\n354\n00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:13.320\nThis time I'll show you the other method.\n\n355\n00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:16.370\nI'm going to right click and\ngo into my network and internet,\n\n356\n00:18:16.370 --> 00:18:20.610\nyou can always go to your control panel,\nor your settings and get there that way.\n\n357\n00:18:20.610 --> 00:18:25.090\nAnd I'm going to click on ethernet, and\nthen the network that I'm connected to.\n\n358\n00:18:25.090 --> 00:18:28.435\nAnd there we can see the same options,\nwhere as when that slide out,\n\n359\n00:18:28.435 --> 00:18:32.140\nit's asking me, hey do you wanna\nmake yourself visible, yes or no?\n\n360\n00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:35.600\nYou have to understand yes means private,\nno means public.\n\n361\n00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:38.850\nHere it's actually labeled public and\nprivate, so just different wording,\n\n362\n00:18:38.850 --> 00:18:41.010\nbut we're changing the same option.\n\n363\n00:18:41.010 --> 00:18:42.920\nSo I changed that to private.\n\n364\n00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:47.360\nNow I'm going to close this, and you'll\nsee that my screen has already changed.\n\n365\n00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:48.908\nIt detected that I'm now\non a private network.\n\n366\n00:18:48.908 --> 00:18:56.450\nIt says hey, Joe, on his computer,\ncreated a homegroup.\n\n367\n00:18:56.450 --> 00:18:59.100\nSo notice, my create is gone.\n\n368\n00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:01.760\nI cannot create a second\nhomegroup on the same network.\n\n369\n00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:03.550\nBut I can join a homegroup.\n\n370\n00:19:03.550 --> 00:19:05.130\nSo let's do that.\n\n371\n00:19:05.130 --> 00:19:07.520\nI'm going to click next on my wizard.\n\n372\n00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:10.660\nDecide what it is I want to share or\nnot to share.\n\n373\n00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:12.520\nI'm just gonna leave the defaults,\nI'll click Next.\n\n374\n00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:15.800\nAnd this is where I need to\nknow what that password was.\n\n375\n00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:20.810\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so we are just to be clear,\nwe are not just getting Joe's information,\n\n376\n00:19:20.810 --> 00:19:22.820\nyou were just prompted,\nwhat do you wanna share?\n\n377\n00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:24.432\nLike, what does Mike wanna share out also?\n\n378\n00:19:24.432 --> 00:19:28.162\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, and you could,\nmaybe I don't want to share anything, but\n\n379\n00:19:28.162 --> 00:19:29.516\nI want to see what Joe has.\n\n380\n00:19:29.516 --> 00:19:31.016\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I could have changed all of those to\n\n381\n00:19:31.016 --> 00:19:33.640\nnot shared, not shared,\nnot shared, not shared.\n\n382\n00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:38.420\nOr you might have a scenario at your\nhousehold where the office computer\n\n383\n00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:42.830\nhas finances, taxes, things that you\ndon't need your kids getting into.\n\n384\n00:19:42.830 --> 00:19:45.310\nSo maybe you don't share\nanything off the machine.\n\n385\n00:19:45.310 --> 00:19:46.470\nBut everybody else shares.\n\n386\n00:19:46.470 --> 00:19:50.460\nSo you can still create the homegroup, or\njoin a homegroup, but not share anything.\n\n387\n00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:52.119\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Yep, absolutely, you can be stingy and\n\n388\n00:19:52.119 --> 00:19:53.172\nnot show us your pictures.\n\n389\n00:19:53.172 --> 00:19:54.830\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Or share your music.\n\n390\n00:19:54.830 --> 00:19:57.190\n&gt;&gt; I thought this was a show\nabout shared resources, Mike?\n\n391\n00:19:57.190 --> 00:19:58.030\n&gt;&gt; It is, right?\n\n392\n00:19:58.030 --> 00:19:59.780\nAnd what you're saying was sharing.\n\n393\n00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:00.650\n&gt;&gt; Is caring.\n\n394\n00:20:00.650 --> 00:20:02.910\n&gt;&gt; That's right, so we should share.\n\n395\n00:20:02.910 --> 00:20:05.130\nAll right, so I typed in the password,\nhopefully I typed it correctly,\n\n396\n00:20:05.130 --> 00:20:09.750\nI'll click Next, and then we wait for\nthe little progress bar.\n\n397\n00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:11.330\nIt shouldn't take it too terribly long.\n\n398\n00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:14.780\nAnd then we should be able\nto join the home group.\n\n399\n00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:17.430\nAssuming, again that I\ngot the password correct.\n\n400\n00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:21.020\nThere we go.\nYou can begin accessing files and\n\n401\n00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:23.750\nprinters shared by other\npeople in the home group.\n\n402\n00:20:23.750 --> 00:20:25.720\nSo I'll click finish.\n\n403\n00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:27.450\nI have the same options here.\n\n404\n00:20:27.450 --> 00:20:29.240\nOne that I didn't show you before,\n\n405\n00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:32.150\nnow that I'm in a homegroup,\nI can leave the homegroup.\n\n406\n00:20:32.150 --> 00:20:35.530\nI no longer want to be part of it,\nI can definitely leave it.\n\n407\n00:20:35.530 --> 00:20:37.227\nOr if I'm getting rid of a machine, and\n\n408\n00:20:37.227 --> 00:20:39.417\nI want to leave it before\nI give it to somebody.\n\n409\n00:20:39.417 --> 00:20:43.757\n&gt;&gt; Man, did you ever threaten\nto run away when you were a kid?\n\n410\n00:20:43.757 --> 00:20:46.750\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I'm gonna leave the homegroup.\n\n411\n00:20:46.750 --> 00:20:48.588\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna leave that homegroup,\nand run away.\n\n412\n00:20:48.588 --> 00:20:52.056\nYeah I made it to about the corner\nof the block and sat down, and\n\n413\n00:20:52.056 --> 00:20:53.470\nmy mom came to pick me up.\n\n414\n00:20:53.470 --> 00:20:56.569\n&gt;&gt; I packed my little backpack and\nthen that was about it [LAUGH].\n\n415\n00:20:56.569 --> 00:20:59.210\n&gt;&gt; All right, so now lets see\nwhat we get from that homegroup.\n\n416\n00:20:59.210 --> 00:21:00.690\nI'm gonna open up file explorer.\n\n417\n00:21:00.690 --> 00:21:03.920\nI'm on the second machine,\nthe one that just joined the homegroup.\n\n418\n00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:06.990\nAnd down here in file explorer,\nI can see Joe,\n\n419\n00:21:06.990 --> 00:21:10.380\nthat's the other computer\nthat created the homegroup.\n\n420\n00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:14.713\nAnd I can expand this out, and\nI can go into documents for example, and\n\n421\n00:21:14.713 --> 00:21:17.230\nthere's Joe secret plans, all right.\n\n422\n00:21:17.230 --> 00:21:19.630\nSo I can see his documents.\n\n423\n00:21:19.630 --> 00:21:22.460\nLet me zoom back out.\n\n424\n00:21:22.460 --> 00:21:28.430\nLet's put something in my documents here,\nwe'll say new text document,\n\n425\n00:21:28.430 --> 00:21:32.860\nand we'll call this one test,\nbecause I'm not feeling all that creative.\n\n426\n00:21:32.860 --> 00:21:34.930\n&gt;&gt; So that's the opposite of secret plans.\n\n427\n00:21:34.930 --> 00:21:37.185\n&gt;&gt; Yes, we're testing those secret plans.\n\n428\n00:21:37.185 --> 00:21:37.889\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n429\n00:21:37.889 --> 00:21:40.615\n&gt;&gt; We go back over to home one,\n\n430\n00:21:40.615 --> 00:21:46.188\nfire up my Windows Explorer,\ndrill down to homegroup,\n\n431\n00:21:46.188 --> 00:21:51.507\nand take a look at that\nsecond computer which did I?\n\n432\n00:21:51.507 --> 00:21:53.590\nMelissa did not choose\nto share her documents.\n\n433\n00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:58.850\nShe left the default, so notice I\ndon't see the documents over there.\n\n434\n00:21:58.850 --> 00:22:02.028\nSo let's go back to one, and\nlet's say Melissa made a mistake.\n\n435\n00:22:02.028 --> 00:22:03.478\nAnd she's like,\nI didn't mean to do that, Joe.\n\n436\n00:22:03.478 --> 00:22:05.570\nSorry, let me share out mine.\n\n437\n00:22:05.570 --> 00:22:06.880\nHow could she fix that?\n\n438\n00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:10.901\nShe could simply go back into\nthose home group settings,\n\n439\n00:22:10.901 --> 00:22:14.671\nchange what you're sharing\nwith the home group, and\n\n440\n00:22:14.671 --> 00:22:18.877\nnow include your documents,\nand click next, and finish.\n\n441\n00:22:18.877 --> 00:22:21.621\nTakes it a minute to\nchange those settings, and\n\n442\n00:22:21.621 --> 00:22:26.300\nchange the access to her documents so that\neverybody on the home group can see it.\n\n443\n00:22:27.910 --> 00:22:29.140\nNow look, she has ton of documents, so\n\n444\n00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:32.110\nhopefully this shouldn't\ntake too terribly long.\n\n445\n00:22:32.110 --> 00:22:33.750\nIt's just being a little slow.\n\n446\n00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:36.590\nAnd as soon as that finishes,\nit's probably already finished.\n\n447\n00:22:36.590 --> 00:22:38.497\nLet's go over here and see.\n\n448\n00:22:38.497 --> 00:22:45.030\nNot yet, might have to refresh\nthe screen before I see documents.\n\n449\n00:22:49.710 --> 00:22:52.443\nIt's taking its sweet time\nadjusting those settings.\n\n450\n00:22:52.443 --> 00:22:54.895\nSo let me go over here and\nclose file explorer.\n\n451\n00:22:54.895 --> 00:22:58.420\nMaybe it's because, you know, it just\npopped up right as I went to close it.\n\n452\n00:22:58.420 --> 00:22:59.230\n&gt;&gt; Of course it did.\n\n453\n00:22:59.230 --> 00:23:00.070\n&gt;&gt; It always does that.\n\n454\n00:23:00.070 --> 00:23:02.842\nAs soon as I get impatient,\nit goes, okay, okay, I'll do it.\n\n455\n00:23:02.842 --> 00:23:07.480\nSo, Melissa's document's just showed up,\nand there's that document called test.\n\n456\n00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:11.650\nNow Joe can open that document up,\nand maybe use Notepad.\n\n457\n00:23:11.650 --> 00:23:12.550\nAnd there it is.\n\n458\n00:23:14.140 --> 00:23:15.230\nSo that's homegroups.\n\n459\n00:23:15.230 --> 00:23:18.220\nAgain, easy way to share resources or\n\n460\n00:23:18.220 --> 00:23:22.550\nfiles in a small network environment\nwhere I don't have a domain.\n\n461\n00:23:22.550 --> 00:23:24.390\nMakes it easy.\n\n462\n00:23:24.390 --> 00:23:27.460\nIt is going away,\naccording to Microsoft's documentation,\n\n463\n00:23:27.460 --> 00:23:29.520\nthe next release of Windows.\n\n464\n00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:32.040\nWhere the next update to Windows\nis gonna take that away.\n\n465\n00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:35.250\nI'm not sure if that's gonna be this\none that's coming out right now\n\n466\n00:23:35.250 --> 00:23:38.680\nas we shoot this, or\nif it's gonna be the fall of 2018.\n\n467\n00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:41.421\nSo, understand what homegroups are,\n\n468\n00:23:41.421 --> 00:23:45.162\njust in case they wanna ask\nyou about that on the exam.\n\n469\n00:23:45.162 --> 00:23:48.670\nAll right Cherokee,\nwhat is next on our topics?\n\n470\n00:23:48.670 --> 00:23:52.207\nLibraries, I think is a good one to go to.\n\n471\n00:23:52.207 --> 00:23:55.021\nSo I am going to flip back to\nthat first machine we were on.\n\n472\n00:23:55.021 --> 00:23:57.381\nSimply because I have\na second partition and\n\n473\n00:23:57.381 --> 00:24:00.440\nit will make the libraries\nmake a little more sense.\n\n474\n00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:03.840\n&gt;&gt; Okay yeah, I'm actually looking\nforwad to you explaining this to me.\n\n475\n00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:08.540\nBecause I've never found a good reason\nto go ahead and work with a library.\n\n476\n00:24:08.540 --> 00:24:09.040\n&gt;&gt; No?\n\n477\n00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:10.680\nWell let's try it let's\nsee if we can find one.\n\n478\n00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:11.240\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n479\n00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:13.100\nLet's talk about what libraries are.\n\n480\n00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:15.940\nLibraries are a logical container.\n\n481\n00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:21.540\nThey're a way to make multiple folders\nlook like they're all in one place.\n\n482\n00:24:22.730 --> 00:24:25.360\nThat's the idea behind libraries.\n\n483\n00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:29.160\nThey can include local locations, but\nthey can also include remote locations.\n\n484\n00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:33.510\nLike USB drives, network shares,\nand things like that.\n\n485\n00:24:33.510 --> 00:24:36.860\nLet me show you what I mean by libraries.\n\n486\n00:24:36.860 --> 00:24:39.690\nI'm on my machine, a Windows 10 machine.\n\n487\n00:24:39.690 --> 00:24:44.810\nGot file explorer open and the first thing\nyou'll have to do is turn on library.\n\n488\n00:24:44.810 --> 00:24:46.330\nNot really turn them on but,\n\n489\n00:24:46.330 --> 00:24:49.200\nmake them visible because\nthey don't show up anymore.\n\n490\n00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:51.690\nIt makes me wonder if this\nfeature is not going away.\n\n491\n00:24:51.690 --> 00:24:53.580\nJust like home groups, I don't know.\n\n492\n00:24:53.580 --> 00:24:54.100\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, okay.\n\n493\n00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:56.970\n&gt;&gt; We'll see what happens right\nwhen the next version comes out.\n\n494\n00:24:56.970 --> 00:25:00.650\nBut they don't show up by default\nanymore like they did back in.\n\n495\n00:25:00.650 --> 00:25:02.840\nGosh, I want to say this was Windows 8 or\nWindows 8:1.\n\n496\n00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:07.530\nBut, I'm going to go to my view menu and\nthen I'm going to choose options.\n\n497\n00:25:07.530 --> 00:25:10.680\nAnd then, change folder and\nsearch options.\n\n498\n00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:14.600\nAnd then in my folder options,\non the view tab,\n\n499\n00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:18.900\nall the way at the bottom\nis this show library.\n\n500\n00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:22.010\nRight down here,\nunderneath my navigation pane options.\n\n501\n00:25:22.010 --> 00:25:25.920\nThen we'll choose show libraries and\nI'll click okay.\n\n502\n00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:27.550\nI'll zoom back out so we can see.\n\n503\n00:25:28.650 --> 00:25:32.737\nAnd there's my libraries, right here.\n\n504\n00:25:32.737 --> 00:25:35.180\nAnd you'll see I have\nseveral default libraries.\n\n505\n00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:38.400\nAlthough this one actually,\nlet me delete this one real quick.\n\n506\n00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:42.210\nSo we can see what it looks\nlike without a created library.\n\n507\n00:25:42.210 --> 00:25:44.990\nAnd then we'll talk about how\nto create those libraries.\n\n508\n00:25:44.990 --> 00:25:48.530\nSo there's my defaults, Documents,\nMusic, Pictures and Videos.\n\n509\n00:25:48.530 --> 00:25:50.550\nAnd if I click on Documents, you'll see,\n\n510\n00:25:50.550 --> 00:25:53.330\nwell, there's a folder\ncalled Windows PowerShell.\n\n511\n00:25:53.330 --> 00:25:59.880\nIf I look at My Documents,\nmy actual C:Users I am logged on as Mike.\n\n512\n00:26:02.476 --> 00:26:05.250\nAnd Documents, there's that\nsame Windows PowerShell folder.\n\n513\n00:26:05.250 --> 00:26:08.430\nIn fact, let me make a new folder just so\nwe can see this.\n\n514\n00:26:08.430 --> 00:26:09.766\nI'll call this one Test.\n\n515\n00:26:09.766 --> 00:26:13.246\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Because you know I am so\n\n516\n00:26:13.246 --> 00:26:14.694\ncreative here.\n\n517\n00:26:14.694 --> 00:26:17.540\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; All right, I'll call that test.\n\n518\n00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:22.000\nAnd if I go back to libraries,\nyou'll see there is that folder test.\n\n519\n00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.680\nSo so far,\nit's no different than my documents.\n\n520\n00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:25.780\n&gt;&gt; You've got nothing\nup your sleeves okay.\n\n521\n00:26:25.780 --> 00:26:26.580\n&gt;&gt; Yeah nothing up my sleeves.\n\n522\n00:26:26.580 --> 00:26:27.320\n&gt;&gt; Alright.\n\n523\n00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:32.220\n&gt;&gt; It's no different than my documents,\nso what is the big deal about libraries?\n\n524\n00:26:32.220 --> 00:26:36.796\nAgain I'm going to go to my e-drive,\nI have several folders over here.\n\n525\n00:26:36.796 --> 00:26:38.510\nYeah and\nthis might be something that you have.\n\n526\n00:26:38.510 --> 00:26:42.354\nWhere you've got a second or third\nhard drive or volume in your computer.\n\n527\n00:26:42.354 --> 00:26:44.690\nYou have folders scattered\nall over the place.\n\n528\n00:26:44.690 --> 00:26:46.060\nWouldn't it be nice to\nget them all together?\n\n529\n00:26:46.060 --> 00:26:49.260\nOr maybe you've got pictures in\ndifferent folders in different places.\n\n530\n00:26:50.310 --> 00:26:54.430\nAnd you want a way to be able to\nget to all of them at one time.\n\n531\n00:26:54.430 --> 00:26:57.127\nThat's really what libraries is all about,\nso let me show you what I mean.\n\n532\n00:26:57.127 --> 00:27:00.040\nI'm gonna right-click on the library.\n\n533\n00:27:00.040 --> 00:27:01.630\nNow, it's tricky, right?\n\n534\n00:27:01.630 --> 00:27:03.840\nThis is not my documents.\n\n535\n00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:06.300\nIt's a library called My Documents.\n\n536\n00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:08.850\nYou'll see when I right-click and\nchoose Properties.\n\n537\n00:27:08.850 --> 00:27:12.920\nIt's not he same properties you would\nnormally see when you click on a folder\n\n538\n00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:14.350\nunder Windows Explorer.\n\n539\n00:27:14.350 --> 00:27:18.040\nLike My Documents, which is an actual\nfolder in Windows Explorer.\n\n540\n00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:19.240\nThis is a library.\n\n541\n00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:21.860\nYou can see it says Library\nright up here at the top.\n\n542\n00:27:21.860 --> 00:27:24.240\nAnd I don't have a share tab,\nI don't have an access control.\n\n543\n00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:26.940\nOr a security tab, or anything like that.\n\n544\n00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:28.780\nThis is not an actual folder.\n\n545\n00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:34.010\nThis is just a logical,\norganizational unit if you will.\n\n546\n00:27:35.020 --> 00:27:39.720\nAll right, so, in this library\nby default is my documents.\n\n547\n00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:42.540\nSo in the documents library\nthere is a pointer.\n\n548\n00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:44.620\nAnd that's a key thing\nto think about here.\n\n549\n00:27:44.620 --> 00:27:48.710\nA pointer to my My Documents\nfolder that's part of my profile.\n\n550\n00:27:48.710 --> 00:27:52.890\nBut I can add additional\npointers to my library.\n\n551\n00:27:52.890 --> 00:27:57.170\n&gt;&gt; Mike, when you use the term pointer,\nwould you say it's almost like a shortcut?\n\n552\n00:27:57.170 --> 00:27:58.580\n&gt;&gt; Yes, absolutely.\n\n553\n00:27:58.580 --> 00:28:00.205\nI would say it's exactly like one almost.\n\n554\n00:28:00.205 --> 00:28:02.010\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Can I say that?\n\n555\n00:28:02.010 --> 00:28:04.930\nExactly and almost,\nhow's that for being indecisive.\n\n556\n00:28:04.930 --> 00:28:06.740\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; No, it really is a shortcut,\n\n557\n00:28:06.740 --> 00:28:08.600\nit's exactly what it is.\n\n558\n00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:12.898\nJust like you would think of a URL or\na shortcut on your desktop.\n\n559\n00:28:12.898 --> 00:28:14.570\nIt's just a pointer to something else.\n\n560\n00:28:14.570 --> 00:28:15.160\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n561\n00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:18.168\n&gt;&gt; So I can click Add and\nI can say, you know what?\n\n562\n00:28:18.168 --> 00:28:25.061\nI wanna include that project data\nfolder in My Documents Library.\n\n563\n00:28:25.061 --> 00:28:26.590\nAnd maybe I want to add another one.\n\n564\n00:28:26.590 --> 00:28:30.920\nI want that ISO folder\nin my documents library.\n\n565\n00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:34.706\nIf I can add all of these different\nlocations and when I click OK.\n\n566\n00:28:34.706 --> 00:28:37.300\nYou'll see that my screen changes.\n\n567\n00:28:37.300 --> 00:28:41.560\nNow that I'm on documents library\nI don't have just one location,\n\n568\n00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:42.480\nI have three locations.\n\n569\n00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:49.510\nI have documents, which is point back to c\ncolon users, Mike dot lab., so my profile.\n\n570\n00:28:49.510 --> 00:28:52.640\nBut I also have that e colon project data,\nand\n\n571\n00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:57.930\ne colon isos,\nall in this one easy to get to location.\n\n572\n00:28:57.930 --> 00:28:59.705\nThat's what libraries are all about,\n\n573\n00:28:59.705 --> 00:29:03.129\na way to\n&gt;&gt; Aggregate or combined.\n\n574\n00:29:03.129 --> 00:29:05.360\n&gt;&gt; Aggregate, yes,\naggregate is a great term.\n\n575\n00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:09.420\nAggregate multiple physical locations,\ninto one logical location.\n\n576\n00:29:09.420 --> 00:29:09.970\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n577\n00:29:09.970 --> 00:29:13.500\nthat's important to make that\ndistinction too logical versus physical.\n\n578\n00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:16.460\nBecause I didn't move\nthe project data folder.\n\n579\n00:29:16.460 --> 00:29:18.870\nIt is not located in my documents, right.\n\n580\n00:29:18.870 --> 00:29:22.100\nProject data is still\nover here on the E drive.\n\n581\n00:29:22.100 --> 00:29:25.998\nI didn't move the ISO's folder,\nit's still over there on the E drive.\n\n582\n00:29:25.998 --> 00:29:29.340\nWhen I double-click on\none of these documents,\n\n583\n00:29:29.340 --> 00:29:33.330\nI'm actually opening up\nthe document on the E drive, right.\n\n584\n00:29:33.330 --> 00:29:36.850\nThis is just a logical\npointer to the document.\n\n585\n00:29:36.850 --> 00:29:43.050\nIf I delete this, right, and that's, which\ndocument is this, let's do document two.\n\n586\n00:29:43.050 --> 00:29:46.000\nRight click and delete, right?\n\n587\n00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:52.030\nIf I go to the E drive and Project Data,\nnotice that Document 2 is gone.\n\n588\n00:29:52.030 --> 00:29:56.010\nSo the physical files still reside\nin their original location.\n\n589\n00:29:56.010 --> 00:29:57.650\nIt's just an, as you said a...\n\n590\n00:29:57.650 --> 00:29:58.890\nwhat was that word that you used?\n\n591\n00:29:58.890 --> 00:30:00.480\n&gt;&gt; Shortcut?\n&gt;&gt; Right before that when you said-\n\n592\n00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:01.120\n&gt;&gt; Aggregate?\n\n593\n00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:04.410\n&gt;&gt; An aggregation of all that information,\nright?\n\n594\n00:30:04.410 --> 00:30:06.410\nWhich again, I find extremely useful.\n\n595\n00:30:06.410 --> 00:30:10.803\nI, many times, I make many,\nmany folders in different places.\n\n596\n00:30:10.803 --> 00:30:12.406\nBut I'm wishing I could get\nto all of them at once.\n\n597\n00:30:12.406 --> 00:30:16.430\nWithout having to move things\nfrom one location to another.\n\n598\n00:30:16.430 --> 00:30:19.220\nSo I truly enjoy libraries.\n\n599\n00:30:19.220 --> 00:30:23.780\nA couple of other things we need to\nbe familiar with about libraries.\n\n600\n00:30:23.780 --> 00:30:28.020\nIf I pull up the Properties again,\nand we take a closer look at this.\n\n601\n00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:31.060\nWe see that there are these\ntwo green check marks.\n\n602\n00:30:31.060 --> 00:30:34.380\nOne of them represents my,\nif I hover over it, I think you'll see it.\n\n603\n00:30:34.380 --> 00:30:36.280\nMy default save location.\n\n604\n00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:40.120\nThe other represents my\npublic save location.\n\n605\n00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:45.040\nAnd what this means is when I save\na file to my documents Where does it go?\n\n606\n00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:50.270\nIf I drag something and drop it on to\nthe MyDocuments library, where does it go?\n\n607\n00:30:50.270 --> 00:30:50.860\nRight.\n\n608\n00:30:50.860 --> 00:30:51.960\nThat's what I'm changing.\n\n609\n00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:56.390\nIn fact, I'm going to change Project Data\nto my default save location.\n\n610\n00:30:57.910 --> 00:31:00.610\nAnd I'm going to zoom back out so\nwe can see the rest of this.\n\n611\n00:31:00.610 --> 00:31:02.420\nI'll go ahead and click okay.\n\n612\n00:31:02.420 --> 00:31:07.046\nNow i'm going to go over here to,\nlet me make a new file\n\n613\n00:31:08.818 --> 00:31:13.330\nAnd I'll call this the test move or\nsomething like that.\n\n614\n00:31:13.330 --> 00:31:18.620\nAnd I'm gonna drag that and\ndrop it onto this documents library.\n\n615\n00:31:18.620 --> 00:31:21.050\nNow when we look at documents,\nlook where it went.\n\n616\n00:31:22.350 --> 00:31:25.550\nIt went into project data on that eDrive.\n\n617\n00:31:25.550 --> 00:31:27.620\nNot into my Documents folder.\n\n618\n00:31:27.620 --> 00:31:29.430\nUnder my sequel and users, right.\n\n619\n00:31:29.430 --> 00:31:33.080\nSo, you can change that\ndefault saved location.\n\n620\n00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:36.114\nIn fact you can remove documents,\nkind of crazy.\n\n621\n00:31:36.114 --> 00:31:39.995\nYou can actually pull out your physical\nmy documents folder from the documents\n\n622\n00:31:39.995 --> 00:31:40.533\nlibrary.\n\n623\n00:31:40.533 --> 00:31:43.415\n&gt;&gt; In my mind as you're explaining\nall this, I'm thinking looking.\n\n624\n00:31:43.415 --> 00:31:44.371\nHow would I use this?\n\n625\n00:31:44.371 --> 00:31:49.944\nAnd like what if we were collaborating in\nsome sort of project and I had a folder\n\n626\n00:31:49.944 --> 00:31:55.635\nfrom, like we had a top secret project\nfolder, or something silly like that.\n\n627\n00:31:55.635 --> 00:31:58.560\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; And each one of my team members,\n\n628\n00:31:58.560 --> 00:32:02.330\nI could link back to their project folder,\nand then I'd have access to it.\n\n629\n00:32:02.330 --> 00:32:06.150\nAnd then like thinking, okay,\nbut we do have options like that.\n\n630\n00:32:06.150 --> 00:32:10.420\nAnd again, it just kind of harkins what\nyou said about maybe seeing it going away.\n\n631\n00:32:10.420 --> 00:32:14.770\nBecause I do have other options\nto have that collaboration,\n\n632\n00:32:14.770 --> 00:32:18.800\na little more intuitive options\nthere within the clouds.\n\n633\n00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:20.085\nSo maybe that is in the future.\n\n634\n00:32:20.085 --> 00:32:24.350\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it could be a tell-tale sign that\nit's not gonna be around for long, maybe.\n\n635\n00:32:24.350 --> 00:32:25.825\nI don't know, I kinda hope it stays.\n\n636\n00:32:25.825 --> 00:32:27.430\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; One more thing I wanna show you, but\n\n637\n00:32:27.430 --> 00:32:28.960\nI know we're getting short on time.\n\n638\n00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:31.740\nYou can create your own library,\nso let's set something up.\n\n639\n00:32:31.740 --> 00:32:33.940\nLet me make another\ncouple of folders here.\n\n640\n00:32:33.940 --> 00:32:39.380\nAnd make a folder called data2,\nover there on the E drive.\n\n641\n00:32:39.380 --> 00:32:44.480\nI'm gonna jump back over to my C drive,\nand I'm gonna make a new folder here, and\n\n642\n00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:50.860\nI'm gonna call it stuff, and maybe inside\nthere I'm gonna make a new folder.\n\n643\n00:32:50.860 --> 00:32:51.700\n&gt;&gt; More stuff?\n\n644\n00:32:51.700 --> 00:32:53.305\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I like that more.\n\n645\n00:32:53.305 --> 00:32:56.329\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Stuff, right.\n\n646\n00:32:56.329 --> 00:32:58.430\nNow I'm gonna go back down to Libraries.\n\n647\n00:33:00.370 --> 00:33:01.450\nAnd I'm gonna create a new one.\n\n648\n00:33:01.450 --> 00:33:06.000\nI'm gonna right click on libraries,\nand choose new library.\n\n649\n00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:12.950\nAnd I'm gonna name this one Project X,\nI guess our new project we're working on.\n\n650\n00:33:12.950 --> 00:33:15.510\nAnd the data for\nProject X is in all those folders and\n\n651\n00:33:15.510 --> 00:33:17.090\ndifferent places on my computer.\n\n652\n00:33:17.090 --> 00:33:21.060\nSo I have to remember which\nlocation contains what files.\n\n653\n00:33:21.060 --> 00:33:22.480\nBrowse to them, find them and\n\n654\n00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:26.620\ngo, it's not in this folder must have\nbeen more stuff not stuff, right?\n\n655\n00:33:26.620 --> 00:33:28.230\nGo navigating around.\n\n656\n00:33:28.230 --> 00:33:29.340\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Or\n\n657\n00:33:29.340 --> 00:33:34.570\nI can take this library,\npull up its properties, click Add, and\n\n658\n00:33:34.570 --> 00:33:38.040\nI can start adding those other\nlocations like ProjectData.\n\n659\n00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:39.980\nI want to include that folder.\n\n660\n00:33:39.980 --> 00:33:45.610\nI also wanna include\ndata2 in this library.\n\n661\n00:33:45.610 --> 00:33:51.030\nI also wanna include not Stuff, but\nMore Stuff, that subfolder, right?\n\n662\n00:33:51.030 --> 00:33:54.062\nThe reason why I didn't have to add\nthe root folder, I can go inside it and\n\n663\n00:33:54.062 --> 00:33:55.170\ngrab a different folder.\n\n664\n00:33:55.170 --> 00:33:57.762\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so you really are getting\nmore organized here, I can see,\n\n665\n00:33:57.762 --> 00:33:58.690\nyou're selling me.\n\n666\n00:33:58.690 --> 00:33:59.270\n&gt;&gt; Am I?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n667\n00:33:59.270 --> 00:33:59.940\n&gt;&gt; Good, see?\n\n668\n00:33:59.940 --> 00:34:01.530\nMaybe that'll make libraries Stick around.\n\n669\n00:34:01.530 --> 00:34:02.771\nI'll click OK.\n\n670\n00:34:02.771 --> 00:34:04.587\nAnd now when I go to Project X,\n\n671\n00:34:04.587 --> 00:34:07.840\nI see those three different locations,\nright?\n\n672\n00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:11.160\nI can choose which is\nthe default save location.\n\n673\n00:34:11.160 --> 00:34:17.150\nRight now the first one you add to the\nlibrary becomes the default save location.\n\n674\n00:34:17.150 --> 00:34:17.890\nSo if you drag or\n\n675\n00:34:17.890 --> 00:34:22.710\ndrop anything over here to Project X, it's\ngonna go into that Project Data folder.\n\n676\n00:34:22.710 --> 00:34:23.790\nBut I could definitely change that.\n\n677\n00:34:23.790 --> 00:34:28.870\nIf I wanted more stuff, I can choose\nit and set that save location.\n\n678\n00:34:28.870 --> 00:34:31.410\nNow that becomes\nthe default save location.\n\n679\n00:34:33.030 --> 00:34:35.781\nAnd I'll zoom back out,\nand we'll go Click OK.\n\n680\n00:34:35.781 --> 00:34:39.191\nSo that's libraries,\nagain it's a logical structure.\n\n681\n00:34:39.191 --> 00:34:42.601\nThe key to remember here is that you,\nfor the exam anyway,\n\n682\n00:34:42.601 --> 00:34:45.036\nis that you have a few built in libraries.\n\n683\n00:34:45.036 --> 00:34:47.542\nDocuments, pictures, music, videos.\n\n684\n00:34:47.542 --> 00:34:51.577\nThey're not visible by default,\nyou have to go up to your options and\n\n685\n00:34:51.577 --> 00:34:55.057\nenable libraries so\nthat you can see them in File Explorer.\n\n686\n00:34:55.057 --> 00:35:00.290\nYou can modify those existing libraries,\nyou can delete the existing libraries.\n\n687\n00:35:00.290 --> 00:35:01.550\nYou can create your own libraries,\n\n688\n00:35:01.550 --> 00:35:05.540\nand you can add as many locations\nto your libraries as you want.\n\n689\n00:35:05.540 --> 00:35:09.990\nYou can also control where the default\nsave location is for those libraries.\n\n690\n00:35:09.990 --> 00:35:13.630\nSo an easy way to organize resources\nthat might otherwise be scattered across\n\n691\n00:35:13.630 --> 00:35:16.498\nyour different hard drives,\nand even external resources.\n\n692\n00:35:16.498 --> 00:35:19.940\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so we do have a little bit more\nto cover here with our shared resources.\n\n693\n00:35:19.940 --> 00:35:23.104\nMike, I'm gonna have to ask you to come\nback for another show if that's okay.\n\n694\n00:35:23.104 --> 00:35:24.684\n&gt;&gt; That's quite all right, I'll be back.\n\n695\n00:35:24.684 --> 00:35:25.655\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, Mike,\n\n696\n00:35:25.655 --> 00:35:27.705\nthen sounds like a plan,\nlet's go ahead and do that.\n\n697\n00:35:27.705 --> 00:35:28.728\nWe'll sign out for now.\n\n698\n00:35:28.728 --> 00:35:30.350\nI've been your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n699\n00:35:30.350 --> 00:35:30.884\n&gt;&gt;

the podium down here.\n\n12\n00:00:35.369 --> 00:00:35.983\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n13\n00:00:35.983 --> 00:00:37.704\n&gt;&gt; No, kidding, I'm glad to be back,\n\n14\n00:00:37.704 --> 00:00:41.350\nexcited as always to be talking about\nWindows 10 with everybody out there.\n\n15\n00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.616\nAnd you have a little bit more to\ndo with good old shared resources.\n\n16\n00:00:45.616 --> 00:00:48.530\nSo go back and check those other\nepisodes out, if you missed those.\n\n17\n00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:50.236\nWe have shared printers and\n\n18\n00:00:50.236 --> 00:00:54.252\nOneDrive left to discuss when\nwe talk about sharing resources.\n\n19\n00:00:54.252 --> 00:00:56.400\nSo let's start with shared printers.\n\n20\n00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.151\nNow in our previous episode,\nwe had looked at homegroups.\n\n21\n00:01:00.151 --> 00:01:04.956\nAnd one of the things that we could share\nthrough that homegroup was printers and\n\n22\n00:01:04.956 --> 00:01:06.150\ndevices.\n\n23\n00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.131\nRemember that was one of\nthe defaults there, but\n\n24\n00:01:08.131 --> 00:01:10.703\nlet's say you're not working\nwith a homegroup environment.\n\n25\n00:01:10.703 --> 00:01:13.015\nMaybe you don't want to\nset up a homegroup or\n\n26\n00:01:13.015 --> 00:01:17.030\nyou're in a domain environment\nwhere you can't create homegroups.\n\n27\n00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.382\nWe still need to be able to share printers\nbecause nowadays printers are not super\n\n28\n00:01:21.382 --> 00:01:22.086\nexpensive.\n\n29\n00:01:22.086 --> 00:01:26.481\nBut we typically don't see organizations\nputting a printer on everybody's\n\n30\n00:01:26.481 --> 00:01:27.240\ndesk right?\n\n31\n00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.469\nI know you worked a lot with printers.\n&gt;&gt; No,\n\n32\n00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:31.712\nthat would be pretty expensive if\nyou thought about it that way.\n\n33\n00:01:31.712 --> 00:01:35.496\nMaybe if we had like one big printer\nthat we were renting from a company.\n\n34\n00:01:35.496 --> 00:01:39.570\nThat's probably a more affordable option\nfor a lot of organizations out there.\n\n35\n00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.304\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, or you might get,\n\n36\n00:01:41.304 --> 00:01:44.267\nmaybe your marketing department\nneeds a really nice-\n\n37\n00:01:44.267 --> 00:01:45.170\n&gt;&gt; Color printer.\n\n38\n00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:46.891\n&gt;&gt; Color printer type thing, but\n\n39\n00:01:46.891 --> 00:01:48.818\nyou can't buy one for everybody.\n\n40\n00:01:48.818 --> 00:01:52.170\nSo you put one in there,\nyou hook it to one computer.\n\n41\n00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.711\nAnd then you share it out so\n\n42\n00:01:53.711 --> 00:01:57.648\nthat the other computers on that\nnetwork can access that printer.\n\n43\n00:01:57.648 --> 00:02:01.380\nSo let's see how we can go\nabout sharing out a printer.\n\n44\n00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.983\nSo I'm on my Windows 10 box here,\njoin me, if you will, thank you, Tanisha.\n\n45\n00:02:03.983 --> 00:02:08.753\nAnd we are going to go to our Start menu,\nand I'm just going to type in, printers,\n\n46\n00:02:08.753 --> 00:02:10.360\nor start typing printers.\n\n47\n00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.189\nYou'll see Printers &amp; Scanners\nat the top of my list, and\n\n48\n00:02:13.189 --> 00:02:16.969\nI'll open that dialog box up, and\nI'm going to first add a printer, right?\n\n49\n00:02:16.969 --> 00:02:20.297\nI can't share a printer if I\ndon't have a printer to share, so\n\n50\n00:02:20.297 --> 00:02:23.820\nI'm going to click,\nAdd a printer or scanner.\n\n51\n00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.575\nAnd I'm going to lie to Windows,\nI don't really have a printer,\n\n52\n00:02:26.575 --> 00:02:28.238\nas you probably saw from the wide view.\n\n53\n00:02:28.238 --> 00:02:32.902\nThere's nothing hooked up to this machine,\nso I'm going to kind of cheat and\n\n54\n00:02:32.902 --> 00:02:33.990\nadd another one.\n\n55\n00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:37.844\nSo I'm going to choose,\nthe printer that I want isn't listed.\n\n56\n00:02:37.844 --> 00:02:43.490\nAnd I am going to add a local printer or\nnetwork printer with manual settings.\n\n57\n00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:45.430\nI'm not bother zooming in and\nshowing you this,\n\n58\n00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.475\nthis isn't typically how you start this,\nright?\n\n59\n00:02:47.475 --> 00:02:52.470\nYou plug your printer into your USB port,\nor you connect to it wirelessly, and\n\n60\n00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:53.990\nyou have your printer.\n\n61\n00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.932\nSo that's not part of what we're doing\nhere, so let me just get it added.\n\n62\n00:02:56.932 --> 00:03:03.600\nNext, next, I'm going to do a Canon Inkjet\n303, because it has a cool name.\n\n63\n00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:08.214\nI'll click Next, and I'm going to\ncall it that Canon Inkjet 0303, and\n\n64\n00:03:08.214 --> 00:03:11.254\nthen I'll click Next and\nit's going to install.\n\n65\n00:03:11.254 --> 00:03:16.370\nNow, during the install process, you are\nprompted if you would like to share it,\n\n66\n00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:19.760\nnotice the default is not\nto share this printer.\n\n67\n00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.927\nBut I could just simply click,\nShare this printer, give it a name,\n\n68\n00:03:22.927 --> 00:03:25.333\nit would pull the name that\nI've already given it.\n\n69\n00:03:25.333 --> 00:03:28.328\nOr I could change it and\nit would be shared out.\n\n70\n00:03:28.328 --> 00:03:30.153\nI'm going to leave it on, Do not share,\n\n71\n00:03:30.153 --> 00:03:33.182\nbecause I want to show you how you\nwould go back and share a printer.\n\n72\n00:03:33.182 --> 00:03:38.180\nAll right, so\nI'll just click Next, and Finish.\n\n73\n00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:41.778\nAnd I now have this Canon Inkjet\n0303 sitting right here, all right?\n\n74\n00:03:41.778 --> 00:03:46.120\nBut now I want to make it available\nto the rest of the network.\n\n75\n00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:49.577\nSo, I'm going to come back\ninto Printers &amp; Scanners,\n\n76\n00:03:49.577 --> 00:03:52.827\nfind the printer I want to share,\nand click Manage.\n\n77\n00:03:52.827 --> 00:03:56.580\nAll right, and from here,\nI can pull up my Printer properties,\n\n78\n00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:00.210\nyou can see that over there on\nthat left hand navigation tree.\n\n79\n00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:02.815\nI'm going to choose,\nPrinter properties, and of course,\n\n80\n00:04:02.815 --> 00:04:05.227\nthere's a couple of ways you\ncan get to this dialog box.\n\n81\n00:04:05.227 --> 00:04:09.110\nYou know how Windows is,\nalways more than one way to go.\n\n82\n00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:13.152\nBut once I get into\nthe properties of that printer,\n\n83\n00:04:13.152 --> 00:04:15.973\nI want to go over to the Sharing tab.\n\n84\n00:04:15.973 --> 00:04:19.192\nAnd here I have a box that says,\nhey, Share this printer,\n\n85\n00:04:19.192 --> 00:04:23.030\nI can simply put a check mark in there and\nchoose to share the printer.\n\n86\n00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:28.033\nIt pulls out the name Canon Inkjet 0303,\nI could change this,\n\n87\n00:04:28.033 --> 00:04:31.428\nmaybe I want to make this\na little more descriptive, right?\n\n88\n00:04:31.428 --> 00:04:32.085\nBecause if,\n\n89\n00:04:32.085 --> 00:04:37.160\nlet's say Cherokee's wanting to print to\nthe printer that she knows is on my desk.\n\n90\n00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.333\nDo you know the exact model number?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I don't know, Mike, I know it's\n\n91\n00:04:40.333 --> 00:04:43.930\nsitting on your desk so maybe that would\nbe more of a helpful indicator for me.\n\n92\n00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:44.486\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n93\n00:04:44.486 --> 00:04:48.104\nlet's share it out as\nMike's Color Printer,\n\n94\n00:04:48.104 --> 00:04:51.830\nor something like that.\n&gt;&gt; Use little girl words [LAUGH].\n\n95\n00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:52.810\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, all right,\n\n96\n00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:55.494\nwhatever you want to call it there.\n&gt;&gt; Digestible\n\n97\n00:04:55.494 --> 00:04:56.547\nwords there.\n&gt;&gt; What's that?\n\n98\n00:04:56.547 --> 00:04:58.608\n&gt;&gt; Digestible words [LAUGH].\n\n99\n00:04:58.608 --> 00:05:00.016\n&gt;&gt; Digestible words, yeah, exactly.\n\n100\n00:05:00.016 --> 00:05:05.340\nAll right, and then I also have this\noption here to List in the directory.\n\n101\n00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:09.338\nNow if you're not in a domain environment,\nif this is a small office where you don't\n\n102\n00:05:09.338 --> 00:05:11.892\nhave a domain,\nyou're not going to use this option.\n\n103\n00:05:11.892 --> 00:05:13.357\nBut in a domain environment,\n\n104\n00:05:13.357 --> 00:05:17.000\nthe directory they're referring\nto here is active directory.\n\n105\n00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.762\nWhere all of our user accounts and\ncomputer accounts are stored.\n\n106\n00:05:19.762 --> 00:05:23.800\nWe can also create objects in active\ndirectory that represent printers.\n\n107\n00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:27.193\nThey're not created by default, but if\nwe check this, it will create an object.\n\n108\n00:05:27.193 --> 00:05:31.698\nAnd that's just going to make it even\neasier for my co-workers to find that.\n\n109\n00:05:31.698 --> 00:05:35.986\nRather than to have to know the name of\nmy computer, and the name of the printer,\n\n110\n00:05:35.986 --> 00:05:38.107\nthis will show up in their search list.\n\n111\n00:05:38.107 --> 00:05:41.116\nAnd they can just pick it,\nwhich will be much easier for them, and\n\n112\n00:05:41.116 --> 00:05:43.415\nthat's what we're trying to do,\nmake it easy for\n\n113\n00:05:43.415 --> 00:05:44.618\nmy co-workers.\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n114\n00:05:44.618 --> 00:05:46.651\n&gt;&gt; So I'll click OK, and\n\n115\n00:05:46.651 --> 00:05:50.360\nthat printer is now shared, right?\n\n116\n00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:53.251\nSo, now that it's shared out,\nhow would somebody access that printer?\n\n117\n00:05:53.251 --> 00:05:56.943\nWell, let's go over to another machine\nthat's on that same network and\n\n118\n00:05:56.943 --> 00:05:58.510\nsee what's going on.\n\n119\n00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:03.276\nI'm going to go to my Start menu,\nand type in, if I can spell,\n\n120\n00:06:03.276 --> 00:06:08.612\nprinters, I'm going to open up my\nPrinters &amp; Scanners dialog box.\n\n121\n00:06:08.612 --> 00:06:11.720\nAnd I'm going to choose to\nAdd a printer or scanner.\n\n122\n00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:14.953\nAnd let's give it just a second to scan,\nand notice what happened,\n\n123\n00:06:14.953 --> 00:06:17.462\nthere is that Canon Inkjet\n0303 on CLIENT01.\n\n124\n00:06:17.462 --> 00:06:22.592\nIt showed up automatically, I didn't\neven have to do any kind of search,\n\n125\n00:06:22.592 --> 00:06:27.540\nI can simply select it from here and\nconnect to that printer.\n\n126\n00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:31.004\nNow if it wasn't here,\nif it didn't show up in this list,\n\n127\n00:06:31.004 --> 00:06:33.429\nif I hadn't listed it in the directory.\n\n128\n00:06:33.429 --> 00:06:36.880\nWhat your co-workers would have to do was\nsay, well, The printer wasn't listed.\n\n129\n00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:44.982\nAnd then they're going to choose an\noption, Select a shared printer by name.\n\n130\n00:06:44.982 --> 00:06:47.756\nNow just like we talked\nabout with shared folders,\n\n131\n00:06:47.756 --> 00:06:52.170\nwe would use what's called a UNC path,\nor universal naming convention.\n\n132\n00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:54.225\nBackslash backslash computer name,\n\n133\n00:06:54.225 --> 00:06:57.376\nbackslash shared name when we\nwere talking about shares.\n\n134\n00:06:57.376 --> 00:07:00.153\nIn the case of printers,\nit's simply going to be backslash\n\n135\n00:07:00.153 --> 00:07:02.940\nbackslash computer name\nbackslash printer name.\n\n136\n00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:06.319\nOr whatever we shared the printer out,\nI called it Mike's Color Printer.\n\n137\n00:07:06.319 --> 00:07:07.105\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n138\n00:07:07.105 --> 00:07:10.560\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so somebody would have to type in\n\n139\n00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:15.179\n\\\\client01\\Mike's Color Printer, right?\n\n140\n00:07:15.179 --> 00:07:17.968\nAnd have to type all that out,\nbut this was what I was saying.\n\n141\n00:07:17.968 --> 00:07:21.625\nIf they didn't know the exact name of it,\nthey don't know the name of my machine,\n\n142\n00:07:21.625 --> 00:07:24.120\nanything like that,\nit's a little more work for them.\n\n143\n00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:28.098\nBy listing it in the directory,\nit makes it very easy for\n\n144\n00:07:28.098 --> 00:07:30.900\nthem to select and then add the device.\n\n145\n00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:34.330\nThe other way will work just fine,\nright, but this is a little bit easier.\n\n146\n00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:38.058\nIt's found it, it sees it,\nit's connecting to it, it's\n\n147\n00:07:38.058 --> 00:07:40.849\ngrabbing a driver if it needs it, and now-\n&gt;&gt; It's ready.\n\n148\n00:07:40.849 --> 00:07:41.518\n&gt;&gt; It's ready.\n\n149\n00:07:41.518 --> 00:07:42.018\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n150\n00:07:42.018 --> 00:07:43.044\n&gt;&gt; How about that,\n\n151\n00:07:43.044 --> 00:07:45.145\nright?\nPretty darn easy, and\n\n152\n00:07:45.145 --> 00:07:48.767\nnow I can print over to that\nprinter sitting on that other desk.\n\n153\n00:07:48.767 --> 00:07:49.644\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you just wait,\n\n154\n00:07:49.644 --> 00:07:52.508\nI'm going to be printing all of my\nbirthday invitations and everything,\n\n155\n00:07:52.508 --> 00:07:55.987\nwasting all your color ink, Mike.\n&gt;&gt; There goes the ink, and yeah,\n\n156\n00:07:55.987 --> 00:08:00.468\nI'm going to be writing a check to\nthe local office supply store for\n\n157\n00:08:00.468 --> 00:08:04.516\nmore ink.\nAll right, so sharing printers out, pretty\n\n158\n00:08:04.516 --> 00:08:10.483\ndarn easy, thank you Windows for that.\nAll right, next thing, or last thing\n\n159\n00:08:10.483 --> 00:08:13.860\non our list of topics, is a good one.\nOne,\n\n160\n00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:17.045\nCherokee, that I know you like.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n161\n00:08:17.045 --> 00:08:19.200\n&gt;&gt; This is OneDrive, right.\n\n162\n00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:21.731\nOneDrive is Microsoft's cloud\n\n163\n00:08:21.731 --> 00:08:25.670\nstorage solution.\nHaving, you remember what it was called\n\n164\n00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:27.440\nbefore OneDrive?\n&gt;&gt; SkyDrive.\n\n165\n00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:29.470\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, good old SkyDrive, right?\n\n166\n00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:30.730\nThat was when it first came out.\n\n167\n00:08:30.730 --> 00:08:32.010\n&gt;&gt; That's when I first set my account up.\n\n168\n00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:32.840\n&gt;&gt; Is it, back when it was\n\n169\n00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:33.640\nSkyDrive?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n170\n00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:35.740\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and I like that name,\n\n171\n00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:39.970\nI thought it was pretty darn cool.\nI think there was some copyright issues,\n\n172\n00:08:39.970 --> 00:08:41.430\nwho knows what happened.\n\n173\n00:08:41.430 --> 00:08:44.350\nBut they ended up\nswitching it to OneDrive.\n\n174\n00:08:44.350 --> 00:08:48.420\nBut One Drive is Microsoft's cloud\nstorage solution, and it allows me to,\n\n175\n00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:49.922\nif you're not familiar with cloud storage.\n\n176\n00:08:49.922 --> 00:08:52.524\nWhich is I'm gonna take my data and\n\n177\n00:08:52.524 --> 00:08:57.387\nrather than storing it on my\nphysical hard drive in my computer.\n\n178\n00:08:57.387 --> 00:08:59.578\nI'm gonna put it out there in the cloud,\nand\n\n179\n00:08:59.578 --> 00:09:02.430\nI'm gonna store it on Microsoft's servers.\n\n180\n00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:03.630\nNow why would I want to do that?\n\n181\n00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:07.970\nWhy would I ever want to store it out\nthere, it's my pictures or my files, or\n\n182\n00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:09.950\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n183\n00:09:09.950 --> 00:09:13.810\nCherokee, why do you use the cloud?\n&gt;&gt; For ease of access,\n\n184\n00:09:13.810 --> 00:09:17.960\nso it is kind of a pro and\na con situation.\n\n185\n00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:22.130\nAnd that's just something that you'll\nhave to Struggle with internally.\n\n186\n00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:26.460\n[LAUGH] Because, yeah you are putting your\ninformation, you're putting yourself out\n\n187\n00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:29.570\nthere, but if it's nothing that\nyou're to concerned about,\n\n188\n00:09:29.570 --> 00:09:34.050\nI mean, if they see my birthday\npictures then who cares, you know.\n\n189\n00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:35.440\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and it's not like its insecure,\n\n190\n00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:37.500\nI mean I don't wanna you\nguys that impression.\n\n191\n00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:39.280\n&gt;&gt; That's true too, I'm just.\n\n192\n00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:41.450\nGet the paranoia,\nthe tin foil hat going on.\n\n193\n00:09:41.450 --> 00:09:42.651\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n194\n00:09:42.651 --> 00:09:44.652\n&gt;&gt; And it's definitely something you gotta\n\n195\n00:09:44.652 --> 00:09:45.224\nconsider.\n\n196\n00:09:45.224 --> 00:09:48.762\nSo if you're choosing a cloud source\nprovider other than Microsoft, for\n\n197\n00:09:48.762 --> 00:09:52.356\nexample, you definitely want to do\nyour research, think about who it is,\n\n198\n00:09:52.356 --> 00:09:54.484\nmaybe look for reviews, things like that.\n\n199\n00:09:54.484 --> 00:09:56.706\nI think we can pretty\nmuch trust Microsoft,\n\n200\n00:09:56.706 --> 00:09:59.057\nI know some of you probably saying,\nI don't.\n\n201\n00:09:59.057 --> 00:10:03.317\nBut in the end Microsoft does a great\njob of keeping our information safe.\n\n202\n00:10:03.317 --> 00:10:07.350\nSo it's gonna be stored up on Microsoft\nservers, and the big advantage as Cherokee\n\n203\n00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:10.470\npointed out, is now that it's\nout there on Microsoft servers.\n\n204\n00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:12.743\nOnce it's in my OneDrive account,\n\n205\n00:10:12.743 --> 00:10:18.410\nI can access it from any computer that has\ninternet access, that is really handy.\n\n206\n00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:19.640\nWe talked about it in the other episode,\n\n207\n00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:23.280\nthis is why things like\nhome groups are going away.\n\n208\n00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:26.029\nBecause rather than have\nto set up a home group,\n\n209\n00:10:26.029 --> 00:10:29.505\njoin home groups,\nlimited way that I can share resources.\n\n210\n00:10:29.505 --> 00:10:34.545\nIs OneDrive, I can share anything,\nI can send Cherokee a link to a specific\n\n211\n00:10:34.545 --> 00:10:37.895\ndocument, or\nan entire folder of documents.\n\n212\n00:10:37.895 --> 00:10:42.175\nWe can do, she can up, I can even give her\nto build I think to store some stuff up\n\n213\n00:10:42.175 --> 00:10:45.555\nthere, or make changes I should\nsay to existing documents.\n\n214\n00:10:45.555 --> 00:10:51.250\nSo it's a very easy to use solution, and\nit's part of your Microsoft account.\n\n215\n00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:53.010\nAnd let's back up,\nI don't think I mentioned that yet,\n\n216\n00:10:53.010 --> 00:10:56.890\nyou get access to OneDrive\na couple of ways.\n\n217\n00:10:56.890 --> 00:11:00.620\nEither by creating a Microsoft account,\nwhich is free to do, or\n\n218\n00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:03.850\nby having an Office 365 subscription.\n\n219\n00:11:03.850 --> 00:11:09.190\nIt is part of your Office 365\nsubscription, so if your business Has O365\n\n220\n00:11:09.190 --> 00:11:14.020\nsubscriptions, there's a good chance you\nshould have access to OneDrive already.\n\n221\n00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:20.650\nIf you have a private personal Microsoft\naccount, that's a .hotmail.com or\n\n222\n00:11:20.650 --> 00:11:25.720\nan @msn.com, if you go old school or\nan outlook.com.\n\n223\n00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:30.610\nAny of those free Microsoft accounts,\nthose come with, gosh,\n\n224\n00:11:30.610 --> 00:11:35.420\nI have to check the limit, in fact,\nlet's go take a look real quick.\n\n225\n00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:42.639\nAt the time of the shooting,\nlet's see what Microsoft One\n\n226\n00:11:42.639 --> 00:11:47.302\ndrive plans, right?\n\n227\n00:11:49.626 --> 00:11:53.186\nLet's see what we've got here,\nso there I can see for\n\n228\n00:11:53.186 --> 00:11:56.780\n99 a year Office 365 Home with Premium.\n\n229\n00:11:56.780 --> 00:12:01.980\nLet me scroll over to the free one,\nOne Drive Basic free, 5 gigabytes.\n\n230\n00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:07.070\nSo out of the box for free, Microsoft's\ngonna give you 5 gigabytes of storage.\n\n231\n00:12:07.070 --> 00:12:09.320\nFor an extra $1.99 a month,\n\n232\n00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:11.740\nyou can get 50 gigabytes of storage.\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n233\n00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:14.740\nthat's a deal if I've ever seen one, Mike.\n&gt;&gt; I know, right?\n\n234\n00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:18.240\nIt is, now I'm not a sales person for\nMicrosoft, but\n\n235\n00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:20.320\nI wanted to show you those options there.\n\n236\n00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:23.730\nSo the point is You get access to this for\nfree,\n\n237\n00:12:23.730 --> 00:12:25.850\nyou don't have to do anything other than\n&gt;&gt; At least you can test it and\n\n238\n00:12:25.850 --> 00:12:28.800\nsee if it's something that\nreally you would even utilize.\n\n239\n00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:29.960\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely, and\n\n240\n00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:34.890\nmost people I think have a Microsoft\naccount of some kind, even it's just a,\n\n241\n00:12:34.890 --> 00:12:37.470\ndon't tell Microsoft,\nto accept my junk mail, right?\n\n242\n00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:41.700\nOr to register for those crazy sites that\nI don't want to give my real email to.\n\n243\n00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:45.090\nAll right, so let's take a look\nat how we can use One Drive.\n\n244\n00:12:45.090 --> 00:12:48.110\nI gotta remember which\ncomputer I I set this up on.\n\n245\n00:12:48.110 --> 00:12:52.390\nSo here, I stopped in the middle\nof setting up this lab for\n\n246\n00:12:52.390 --> 00:12:54.620\nyou guys,\nbecause I wanted to show you this.\n\n247\n00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:57.700\nSo it's a little awkward\nstarting on this screen, but\n\n248\n00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:02.010\nthis is a Windows 10 machine that\nhad a local user account on it.\n\n249\n00:13:02.010 --> 00:13:04.630\nAnd local user accounts,\nthat's not a Microsoft account.\n\n250\n00:13:04.630 --> 00:13:09.090\nThat's an account that was created locally\non this machine, that I can login with.\n\n251\n00:13:09.090 --> 00:13:14.130\nWhat I did is I said hey, I wanna allow\nthis person to login to my machine.\n\n252\n00:13:14.130 --> 00:13:16.230\nAnd I can show you how I\ndid it in just a second,\n\n253\n00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:21.290\nbut I've now logged into this same\nmachine with a Microsoft account.\n\n254\n00:13:21.290 --> 00:13:24.070\nAnd as soon as I logged in,\nthis is what came up.\n\n255\n00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:28.020\nIt's the first time I'm logging into the\nmachine with this Microsoft account and\n\n256\n00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:31.490\nit's saying hey, do you wanna go ahead and\nsetup OneDrive on this machine?\n\n257\n00:13:31.490 --> 00:13:33.680\nIt's all built right in to Windows 10.\n\n258\n00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:38.810\nI'm gonna say no, because I wanna show\nyou how to set it up through Windows,\n\n259\n00:13:38.810 --> 00:13:42.870\nbut I did wanna show you this,\nand how easy it does it itself.\n\n260\n00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:46.680\nI mean it sets it up for you, but I'm\ngonna choose only save files to this PC.\n\n261\n00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:51.870\nJust because again I want to show\nyou how to set this up if you were\n\n262\n00:13:51.870 --> 00:13:52.950\nalready logged in.\n\n263\n00:13:52.950 --> 00:13:54.820\nCuz even if you logged\nin with a local account,\n\n264\n00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:59.660\nyou can associate your own Microsoft\naccount with that local account, or\n\n265\n00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:03.770\nyou can log in directly with that\nMicrosoft account, either way, all right?\n\n266\n00:14:03.770 --> 00:14:09.274\nSo here I am, I'm logged with actually\nmy work account, Mike@itpro.tv.\n\n267\n00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:14.760\nIt's still building my profile, as you can\nsee there's little arrows pointing here.\n\n268\n00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:21.664\nLet me switch over to the local\nadmin account really quick.\n\n269\n00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:30.530\nGet logged in here, and\nall I did was go into my settings.\n\n270\n00:14:30.530 --> 00:14:33.380\nAnd then accounts, and then family and\n\n271\n00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:37.700\nother people, and\nI clicked add someone else to this PC.\n\n272\n00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:41.230\nAnd I added my work\nemail account which is.\n\n273\n00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:44.460\n&gt;&gt; Office 365.\n\n274\n00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:47.147\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it has office 365 subscription\n\n275\n00:14:47.147 --> 00:14:49.310\nassociated with.\n\n276\n00:14:49.310 --> 00:14:54.250\nAll right, and so that's why I'm able to\nlogin to this machine using mike@itpro.tv.\n\n277\n00:14:54.250 --> 00:15:00.030\nThis computer is not part of my\nITPro.TV domain or anything like that.\n\n278\n00:15:00.030 --> 00:15:04.904\nBut I clicked Add someone else, and\nhere I can show I click Add someone else.\n\n279\n00:15:04.904 --> 00:15:10.293\nAnd I could type in\nmike.rodirck@hotmail.com,\n\n280\n00:15:10.293 --> 00:15:14.830\nnext, and you're good to go and finished.\n\n281\n00:15:14.830 --> 00:15:19.530\nAnd so now mike.roderick@hotmail.com\ncould log in to this machine, right?\n\n282\n00:15:19.530 --> 00:15:23.910\nMicrosoft really wants to use a Microsoft\naccount, and not create local accounts,\n\n283\n00:15:23.910 --> 00:15:26.780\nif you haven't got that hint yet.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n284\n00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:28.910\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] They're not too\n\n285\n00:15:28.910 --> 00:15:29.896\nsubtle about it.\n&gt;&gt; No,\n\n286\n00:15:29.896 --> 00:15:30.740\nthey're not [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n287\n00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:34.034\nI'm going to switch back\nover to that mike@itpro.tv.\n\n288\n00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:40.350\nSo let me re-authenticate here,\nwhenever it decide it's gonna let me.\n\n289\n00:15:40.350 --> 00:15:44.263\nThere we go, boy, that's an ugly mug.\n&gt;&gt; You we're wearing the same shirt?\n\n290\n00:15:44.263 --> 00:15:46.331\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That is an ugly mug, there.\n\n291\n00:15:46.331 --> 00:15:50.149\nAll right, so here we go,\nI'm logged in again as mike@itpro.tv.\n\n292\n00:15:50.149 --> 00:15:53.731\nAnd what I wanna do is I\nwanna set up One Drive, so\n\n293\n00:15:53.731 --> 00:15:57.865\nI'm going to go to my start menu and\nI'm gonna type in.\n\n294\n00:15:57.865 --> 00:16:01.990\nOneDrive, it wants us to install the app\nand that is not actually what I want.\n\n295\n00:16:01.990 --> 00:16:03.890\nIt's still, there we go.\n\n296\n00:16:03.890 --> 00:16:06.090\nI went down here,\nif you look behind my head,\n\n297\n00:16:06.090 --> 00:16:09.180\nif we can go full screen there Taneisha.\n\n298\n00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:13.210\nHere, my Start menu over my taskbar area.\n\n299\n00:16:13.210 --> 00:16:17.519\nI can see this little cloudy icon and when\nI have it hover over it, it says OneDrive,\n\n300\n00:16:17.519 --> 00:16:18.940\nNot signed in.\n\n301\n00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:21.624\nI did that that just before,\nbefore you could see it,\n\n302\n00:16:21.624 --> 00:16:24.548\nmy picture was still there and\nthe OneDrive icon was not there.\n\n303\n00:16:24.548 --> 00:16:26.960\nAnd that was because it was\nstill building my profile, so\n\n304\n00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:29.660\nif don't see it right away,\ngive it a minute.\n\n305\n00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:33.840\nIt'll typically pop up a couple\nof messages on you and say, hey,\n\n306\n00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:37.840\ndo you wanna sign in to OneDrive,\naccess all your files from one place?\n\n307\n00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:42.759\nBut I'm simply gonna go to\nthat little icon and choose,\n\n308\n00:16:42.759 --> 00:16:47.897\nI'm gonna click on it,\nif I can get the right option here.\n\n309\n00:16:47.897 --> 00:16:50.290\nIt's not asking me to sign-in and\nwe click Settings.\n\n310\n00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:55.900\nAnd I'm gonna go to my Settings or\nI'm sorry, go to my Account and\n\n311\n00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:57.290\nchoose Add an Account.\n\n312\n00:16:57.290 --> 00:17:00.610\nNow I will tell you,\nthis stuff is changing quickly.\n\n313\n00:17:00.610 --> 00:17:04.920\nSo every time you update your machine,\nthis might be slightly different.\n\n314\n00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:10.580\nI know that OneDrive has changed, the Fall\nCreators Update made some big change.\n\n315\n00:17:10.580 --> 00:17:16.380\nSo the, wow and I'm hands off, I don't\nknow what that just did, who knows there.\n\n316\n00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:21.120\nBut they made some big changes\ncuz back in Windows 8.1,\n\n317\n00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:25.370\nwhen you used OneDrive,\nwe had these place holders for our files.\n\n318\n00:17:25.370 --> 00:17:27.450\nAnd I'll show you what I\nmean here in a minute,\n\n319\n00:17:27.450 --> 00:17:31.200\nthen it changed to more\nlike a Dropbox style.\n\n320\n00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:34.280\nDropbox is a different vendor,\ncloud storage provider.\n\n321\n00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:37.320\nWhere everything was synced\ndown to your local machine and\n\n322\n00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:39.330\nalso stored up in the cloud.\n\n323\n00:17:39.330 --> 00:17:42.885\nBut one of the big advantages of storing\nmy stuff in the cloud is not taking up\n\n324\n00:17:42.885 --> 00:17:44.780\ndisk space on my local machine.\n\n325\n00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:49.334\nSo with the Windows 10 Fall Creators\nUpdate that we just got not too long ago,\n\n326\n00:17:49.334 --> 00:17:51.800\n9/17 or what have you.\n\n327\n00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:56.270\nThey changed back to\nthe old way of doing it,\n\n328\n00:17:56.270 --> 00:18:00.688\nwhich was only sync down what we\nactually want, not everything.\n\n329\n00:18:00.688 --> 00:18:07.619\nSo and as I was saying,\nOneDrive is actually already syncing.\n\n330\n00:18:07.619 --> 00:18:11.401\nIt's kind of, I know Cherokee,\nthis is going to creep you out.\n\n331\n00:18:11.401 --> 00:18:14.172\nIt's already signed in,\nwe didn't actually sign in and it's\n\n332\n00:18:14.172 --> 00:18:17.100\nalready found my account and signed in.\n&gt;&gt; Okay\n\n333\n00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:18.285\n[LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n334\n00:18:18.285 --> 00:18:21.356\nI'll tell you the machines do a lot\nof thinking for themselves nowadays.\n\n335\n00:18:21.356 --> 00:18:23.427\n&gt;&gt; You know what, actually,\n\n336\n00:18:23.427 --> 00:18:29.585\nto add fuel to my paranoia fire okay, the\nfirst time I ever really saw any kind of.\n\n337\n00:18:29.585 --> 00:18:34.433\n[SOUND] It wasn't facial recognition but\nthe true story,\n\n338\n00:18:34.433 --> 00:18:39.489\nages ago I did upload birthday\nparty photos to my SkyDrive.\n\n339\n00:18:39.489 --> 00:18:42.540\nAnd there was some sort of scanning and\nautomation taking place.\n\n340\n00:18:42.540 --> 00:18:48.378\nBecause there were suggested hashtags to\nadd to my photos that I had uploaded.\n\n341\n00:18:48.378 --> 00:18:52.592\nAnd this was years ago before hashtags\nwere even popular and it's like,\n\n342\n00:18:52.592 --> 00:18:56.130\nhashtag cupcake and I'm like hm?\n&gt;&gt; How the heck did it know\n\n343\n00:18:56.130 --> 00:18:57.570\nyou had a cupcake in there?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n344\n00:18:57.570 --> 00:19:01.028\n&gt;&gt; Wow scary stuff, I mean it's true,\n\n345\n00:19:01.028 --> 00:19:05.263\n[LAUGH] it can tend to worry you, right?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and that's the other thing and\n\n346\n00:19:05.263 --> 00:19:08.542\nI've seen articles where people who had\nstuff there would get busted for that.\n\n347\n00:19:08.542 --> 00:19:10.760\nBut if you're legit then what\ndo you gotta worry about?\n\n348\n00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:11.286\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you don't have\n\n349\n00:19:11.286 --> 00:19:12.190\nanything to worry about.\n\n350\n00:19:12.190 --> 00:19:15.010\nAll right, so\nlet's go back to my screen here.\n\n351\n00:19:15.010 --> 00:19:17.390\nNormally, actually,\nI will be honest with you.\n\n352\n00:19:17.390 --> 00:19:19.830\nThat's the first time I've\never seen it do that.\n\n353\n00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:23.620\nI was fully expecting to click\non my little icon down here and\n\n354\n00:19:23.620 --> 00:19:29.110\nI should have had an option to\nsign into OneDrive, all right?\n\n355\n00:19:29.110 --> 00:19:32.327\nBecause I haven't signed\ninto OneDrive yet, so\n\n356\n00:19:32.327 --> 00:19:35.786\nbut another thing I should\nbe honest with you about.\n\n357\n00:19:35.786 --> 00:19:40.167\nI set this up as a test and\nthen I removed everything for the show, so\n\n358\n00:19:40.167 --> 00:19:43.544\nthat I could show you how\nto go trough this process.\n\n359\n00:19:43.544 --> 00:19:45.156\nMost likely-\n&gt;&gt; What else have you been honest with us?\n\n360\n00:19:45.156 --> 00:19:45.969\n&gt;&gt; I know-\n\n361\n00:19:45.969 --> 00:19:46.661\n&gt;&gt; About [LAUGH].\n\n362\n00:19:46.661 --> 00:19:48.314\n&gt;&gt; I'm not very honest, am I?\n\n363\n00:19:48.314 --> 00:19:53.019\nMost likely what happened is some things\nwere still in the registry, and so\n\n364\n00:19:53.019 --> 00:19:54.500\nit picked that up.\n&gt;&gt; Gotcha.\n\n365\n00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:55.940\n&gt;&gt; And it's just automatically doing\n\n366\n00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:56.470\nit.\n&gt;&gt; Recognizing.\n\n367\n00:19:56.470 --> 00:19:58.360\n&gt;&gt; It's not as creepy as it knows,\n\n368\n00:19:58.360 --> 00:19:59.953\nit saw my face.\n&gt;&gt; We're putting it out to\n\n369\n00:19:59.953 --> 00:20:00.590\nbe.\n&gt;&gt; Ooh, yeah.\n\n370\n00:20:00.590 --> 00:20:01.534\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n371\n00:20:01.534 --> 00:20:02.054\n&gt;&gt; Just wanted to worry\n\n372\n00:20:02.054 --> 00:20:02.792\nCherokee for a minute then.\n\n373\n00:20:02.792 --> 00:20:03.993\nThe machines are taking over.\n\n374\n00:20:03.993 --> 00:20:10.920\n[LAUGH] All right, so again,\nit automatically linked my account.\n\n375\n00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:15.425\nIf it hadn't, there would've been an\noption when I right-clicked down here to\n\n376\n00:20:15.425 --> 00:20:16.628\nsign in to OneDrive.\n\n377\n00:20:16.628 --> 00:20:21.274\nAnd that would simply do what it just did,\nconnect my machine to OneDrive,\n\n378\n00:20:21.274 --> 00:20:22.550\nto my account.\n\n379\n00:20:22.550 --> 00:20:25.550\nMy free store that Microsoft\nhas already given me.\n\n380\n00:20:25.550 --> 00:20:27.340\nI'll come back to these\nsettings in just a second but\n\n381\n00:20:27.340 --> 00:20:29.240\nlet's see what it ended up doing, right?\n\n382\n00:20:30.270 --> 00:20:35.700\nI'll open up file explorer and I now have\nthis OneDrive node over here, right?\n\n383\n00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:38.320\nAll right, I'm gonna zoom in for\nyou or not zoom in.\n\n384\n00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:40.910\nEvidently, I don't have\nZoomIt in this machine.\n\n385\n00:20:43.270 --> 00:20:46.190\nSo see if I have access to that.\n\n386\n00:20:46.190 --> 00:20:47.580\nLet me grab ZoomIt real quick just so,\n\n387\n00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:49.780\nI know some of the stuff\ncomes out a little bit small.\n\n388\n00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:53.188\nAnd sometimes, they forget to-\n&gt;&gt; Well that's very nice of you,\n\n389\n00:20:53.188 --> 00:20:55.331\nthinking of us.\n&gt;&gt; Install, yeah.\n\n390\n00:20:55.331 --> 00:20:58.652\n&gt;&gt; Vision inhibited individuals.\n\n391\n00:20:58.652 --> 00:20:59.852\n&gt;&gt; If you're curious,\n\n392\n00:20:59.852 --> 00:21:02.857\nZoomIt is made by Sysinternals,\nMark Russinovich.\n\n393\n00:21:02.857 --> 00:21:06.191\nGreat guy, brilliant, I love this tool.\n\n394\n00:21:06.191 --> 00:21:10.960\nSo now that I've got that,\nlet me just fire Windows back up.\n\n395\n00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:14.680\nAnd now I should be able to zoom in,\nlook at that, how easy that was,\n\n396\n00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:16.610\nthank you Sysinternals.\n\n397\n00:21:16.610 --> 00:21:18.510\nSo here we go, I've got OneDrive.\n\n398\n00:21:18.510 --> 00:21:19.910\nAnd if I select that,\n\n399\n00:21:19.910 --> 00:21:25.170\nthese are all the folders that I have\nalready in my OneDrive account, all right?\n\n400\n00:21:25.170 --> 00:21:28.000\nI'm gonna zoom back out just to make\nnavigation a little bit easier.\n\n401\n00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.871\nInside these folders, I'll see Documents.\n\n402\n00:21:30.871 --> 00:21:35.320\nSo these are documents I created on\na different PC somewhere, right, and\n\n403\n00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:37.633\nI stored them in my OneDrive account.\n\n404\n00:21:37.633 --> 00:21:41.501\nAnd now, when I go to a different\nmachine like you just saw me log in for\n\n405\n00:21:41.501 --> 00:21:45.490\nthe first time on this PC, and\nI have access to all of these files.\n\n406\n00:21:45.490 --> 00:21:52.120\nI can open them up, I can make changes\nto them, I can do whatever I need to do.\n\n407\n00:21:53.370 --> 00:21:56.830\nNow, let's see what I got.\n\n408\n00:21:56.830 --> 00:21:59.250\nIt looks like everything\nhas synchronized now.\n\n409\n00:21:59.250 --> 00:22:03.427\nSee the green check marks are indicators\nthat these resources have been\n\n410\n00:22:03.427 --> 00:22:04.800\nsynchronized.\n\n411\n00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:08.966\nAnd they are currently residing\non my physical machine.\n\n412\n00:22:08.966 --> 00:22:13.073\nIf I try to open up one of these,\nthat should be as an XML document,\n\n413\n00:22:13.073 --> 00:22:14.740\nI was gonna use to open it.\n\n414\n00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:17.801\nHere are some notes I was making back\nwhen I was teaching a [INAUDIBLE]\n\n415\n00:22:17.801 --> 00:22:18.629\ncourse, right?\n\n416\n00:22:18.629 --> 00:22:21.170\nSo there is that document there.\n\n417\n00:22:21.170 --> 00:22:25.230\nIf I want to make a new document.\n\n418\n00:22:25.230 --> 00:22:27.880\nI'm just gonna say New &gt; Text Document.\n\n419\n00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:34.388\nI'm gonna call it OneDrive Test.\n\n420\n00:22:34.388 --> 00:22:38.390\nAnd if you look really closely,\ntheres a little sync icon going on for\n\n421\n00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:39.630\njust a second.\n\n422\n00:22:39.630 --> 00:22:43.345\nIt is now synchronized up with\nthe cloud or with OneDrive.\n\n423\n00:22:43.345 --> 00:22:48.182\nSo I can access that from any\nmachine that has Internet access.\n\n424\n00:22:48.182 --> 00:22:51.330\nAll right now,\nlet's take a look at those settings again.\n\n425\n00:22:51.330 --> 00:22:53.170\nSo I'm gonna click on Settings.\n\n426\n00:22:55.630 --> 00:22:57.990\nIf I did not want to use\nthis machine anymore,\n\n427\n00:22:57.990 --> 00:23:03.340\nmaybe I got rid of that account or\nI just don't want that on here.\n\n428\n00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:05.710\nI can definitely unlink this PC.\n\n429\n00:23:05.710 --> 00:23:09.890\nI would remove the account or the link\nbetween OneDrive and this account and\n\n430\n00:23:09.890 --> 00:23:13.150\nI would no longer see those resources,\nthey would not be available.\n\n431\n00:23:13.150 --> 00:23:15.310\nI also have the option to choose folders.\n\n432\n00:23:15.310 --> 00:23:19.650\nThis is how I can choose what is\ngonna be visible on my machine.\n\n433\n00:23:19.650 --> 00:23:25.060\nThe files you sync will take up space on\nthis PC, so I'm seeing those files here.\n\n434\n00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:29.620\nIf I didn't want them, I could simply\nuncheck these check boxes and it wouldn't\n\n435\n00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:33.930\nsync those files down, all right?\n&gt;&gt; Which would be realy great if I had\n\n436\n00:23:33.930 --> 00:23:36.890\nsome kind of device like\na tablet that didn't\n\n437\n00:23:36.890 --> 00:23:40.299\neasily allow me to add additional storage.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you know what,\n\n438\n00:23:40.299 --> 00:23:43.568\nif you have 50 gigabytes of\nstorage up there in OneDrive.\n\n439\n00:23:43.568 --> 00:23:48.065\nDon't necessarily want all 50 gigabytes of\nthose files coming down to every PC that\n\n440\n00:23:48.065 --> 00:23:48.820\nyou log on to.\n\n441\n00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:51.896\nSo you definitely might\nwant to change that.\n\n442\n00:23:51.896 --> 00:23:56.185\nIf I go back over to Settings, I want to\ntake a look at a couple of these options\n\n443\n00:23:56.185 --> 00:24:01.280\nhere, and this is what I was talking about\nwith the way Microsoft made some changes.\n\n444\n00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:05.140\nWhat you saw right there was the old\nbehavior, all of those files\n\n445\n00:24:05.140 --> 00:24:09.140\nautomatically synchronized down to my\ndesktop, or down to my local machine.\n\n446\n00:24:09.140 --> 00:24:10.520\nIn fact, let's take a look.\n\n447\n00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:13.500\nIf I pull up the properties of,\nI don't know,\n\n448\n00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:15.790\nlet's see if I got anything\nbigger than a text document.\n\n449\n00:24:17.844 --> 00:24:18.610\nProbably not.\n\n450\n00:24:18.610 --> 00:24:23.182\nLet me pull up the properties\nof this Word document, and\n\n451\n00:24:23.182 --> 00:24:27.478\nI'll see that I have size\non disk is 16 kilobytes.\n\n452\n00:24:27.478 --> 00:24:29.357\nIt's 14, 16 kilobytes in size so\n\n453\n00:24:29.357 --> 00:24:32.186\nit's definitely taking up\nspace on my local hard drive.\n\n454\n00:24:32.186 --> 00:24:36.748\nAgain, it's stored in\nMicrosoft's OneDrive,\n\n455\n00:24:36.748 --> 00:24:40.610\nbut there is a copy here on my machine.\n\n456\n00:24:40.610 --> 00:24:43.060\nNow if I open this file up and\nI make changes to it,\n\n457\n00:24:43.060 --> 00:24:46.620\nthose changes will be synchronized\nwith the copy that's up in OneDrive.\n\n458\n00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:50.860\nSo if I go to another machine, connect\nto OneDrive, I'd see those changes.\n\n459\n00:24:50.860 --> 00:24:53.710\nSo even though there's more than one\ncopy at this point in the document,\n\n460\n00:24:53.710 --> 00:24:56.600\nthe changes are gonna\nbe kept synchronized.\n\n461\n00:24:56.600 --> 00:25:00.720\nBecause they're local to my machine,\nif I lose Internet access, or\n\n462\n00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:03.030\nif I go somewhere where\nthere isn't Internet access,\n\n463\n00:25:03.030 --> 00:25:08.070\nI can still access these files, because\nthey are stored locally on my machine.\n\n464\n00:25:08.070 --> 00:25:09.580\nI can make changes to them.\n\n465\n00:25:09.580 --> 00:25:12.850\nAnd as soon as I reconnect it,\nonce I got Internet access again,\n\n466\n00:25:12.850 --> 00:25:15.840\nit would then synchronize those\nchanges at the OneDrive, right?\n\n467\n00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:19.240\nSo it'll work, you can work with those\ndocuments locally, and as soon as you\n\n468\n00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:23.540\nregain network access or Internet access,\nit'll synchronize your changes up there.\n\n469\n00:25:23.540 --> 00:25:25.328\nThis is the old behavior.\n\n470\n00:25:25.328 --> 00:25:29.830\nI didn't realize it was going to\nremember some of my settings that I was\n\n471\n00:25:29.830 --> 00:25:33.492\nplaying around with, so\nlet's go back into settings and\n\n472\n00:25:33.492 --> 00:25:37.390\nlet's change this to what\nit looks like nowadays.\n\n473\n00:25:37.390 --> 00:25:41.920\nI'm gonna come down here and I'm gonna\nchoose this option, Files On-Demand.\n\n474\n00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:47.370\nNotice it says, save space and\ndownload files as you use them, right?\n\n475\n00:25:47.370 --> 00:25:52.145\nI'm gonna check that and\nI'm gonna click OK, right?\n\n476\n00:25:52.145 --> 00:25:55.470\nAnd let's give this just\na second to see if it updates.\n\n477\n00:25:55.470 --> 00:25:57.596\nThere it goes, all right.\n\n478\n00:25:57.596 --> 00:26:03.108\n[COUGH] And now, when we look at these\nfiles, I've got the status column.\n\n479\n00:26:03.108 --> 00:26:08.344\nThis all due to the Fall Creators Update\nthat came out in Windows 10.\n\n480\n00:26:08.344 --> 00:26:09.636\nI get this status and\n\n481\n00:26:09.636 --> 00:26:14.730\nthis green check mark indicates that these\nfiles are found locally on my drive.\n\n482\n00:26:14.730 --> 00:26:17.710\nI mean, they're still stored up in\nthe Cloud, but there's also a copy of them\n\n483\n00:26:17.710 --> 00:26:21.590\nhere locally taking up space, and\nthat might not be what I want.\n\n484\n00:26:21.590 --> 00:26:25.950\nSo what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna right\nclick on that Metasploit Outline.\n\n485\n00:26:25.950 --> 00:26:27.610\nLet me zoom out so you can see this.\n\n486\n00:26:27.610 --> 00:26:31.228\nI'm going to right click on it and\nI'm gonna choose Free up space.\n\n487\n00:26:31.228 --> 00:26:36.740\nAnd when I select that if we watch this\nicon, see how it synced for a second and\n\n488\n00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:41.481\nthen it changed to a little white\npuffy cloud with a blue outline,\n\n489\n00:26:41.481 --> 00:26:42.104\nright?\n\n490\n00:26:42.104 --> 00:26:42.872\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n491\n00:26:42.872 --> 00:26:43.543\n&gt;&gt; It's so friendly.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n492\n00:26:43.543 --> 00:26:44.812\n&gt;&gt; Now, let's take a look at\n\n493\n00:26:44.812 --> 00:26:46.840\nthe properties of this document.\n\n494\n00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:54.043\nLet me zoom back out, Properties, and now\nlook at the size on disk, 0 bytes, right?\n\n495\n00:26:54.043 --> 00:26:55.949\nThat granted, that wasn't a huge file,\n\n496\n00:26:55.949 --> 00:26:58.370\nit was only 14 kilobytes to start with.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n497\n00:26:58.370 --> 00:26:59.375\n&gt;&gt; I think you get the point.\n\n498\n00:26:59.375 --> 00:27:04.700\nIt's now no longer stored locally,\nit's only up there in Azure.\n\n499\n00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:08.550\nI see it right here in File Explorer,\nright?\n\n500\n00:27:08.550 --> 00:27:12.130\nAnd I can still work with it,\nbut it's not stored locally.\n\n501\n00:27:12.130 --> 00:27:17.320\nWhat'll happen is when I double click on\nit, it'll open it up and look at the icon.\n\n502\n00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:19.670\nIt's now stored locally.\n\n503\n00:27:19.670 --> 00:27:21.970\nSo this is the default behavior for\n\n504\n00:27:21.970 --> 00:27:25.450\nOneDrive now,\nafter the Fall Creators Update.\n\n505\n00:27:25.450 --> 00:27:30.690\nWhen you turn it on, it's not gonna\nsync anything down to your computer.\n\n506\n00:27:30.690 --> 00:27:34.180\nEverything is gonna have\na little blue cloud next to it.\n\n507\n00:27:34.180 --> 00:27:36.320\nAs you open up documents,\n\n508\n00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:39.672\nit'll only synchronize those\ndocuments that you've opened.\n\n509\n00:27:39.672 --> 00:27:42.060\nThis is all right, this is something\nyou're working with currently,\n\n510\n00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:44.550\nI'll go ahead and\nmake a copy of it available locally.\n\n511\n00:27:44.550 --> 00:27:47.890\nSo that if you lose connectivity,\nyou can still work with the document.\n\n512\n00:27:47.890 --> 00:27:51.892\nBut it only does that for\ndocuments that you double click on, right?\n\n513\n00:27:51.892 --> 00:27:55.681\nWhich is great, because now I don't have\nto worry about how much space it's eating\n\n514\n00:27:55.681 --> 00:27:56.770\nup on my local machine.\n\n515\n00:27:56.770 --> 00:28:00.800\nIt's only gonna be syncing things\nthat I'm currently working with or\n\n516\n00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:02.340\nthat I've double clicked on.\n\n517\n00:28:02.340 --> 00:28:06.260\nIf I double click on it, open it up and\nit does sync down locally,\n\n518\n00:28:06.260 --> 00:28:09.230\nit might get to the point where\nI'm running low on space, and\n\n519\n00:28:09.230 --> 00:28:11.380\nI don't want it synced locally anymore.\n\n520\n00:28:11.380 --> 00:28:14.950\nI can simply right click on it again and\nchoose Free up space.\n\n521\n00:28:16.410 --> 00:28:19.310\nAnd you'll see,\nit goes back to that Cloud icon, right?\n\n522\n00:28:19.310 --> 00:28:22.900\nSo now, it's no longer on my device,\nit's only stored up in the Cloud.\n\n523\n00:28:24.090 --> 00:28:28.840\nOther options you can do\nare always keep on this device.\n\n524\n00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:30.201\nLet's use that option.\n\n525\n00:28:30.201 --> 00:28:33.534\nYou'll see it starts to sync and\nnow notice that the check\n\n526\n00:28:33.534 --> 00:28:38.580\nmark is a solid green circle instead of\na white circle with a green check mark.\n\n527\n00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:43.080\nSo there's three different statuses\nyou'll see in your OneDrive folders.\n\n528\n00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:47.625\nThere's the Cloud, which means it's\nnot on your local device at all,\n\n529\n00:28:47.625 --> 00:28:50.137\nonly up in the Cloud up on the OneDrive.\n\n530\n00:28:50.137 --> 00:28:53.860\nBut if you double click it,\nwill sync it down to your device for you.\n\n531\n00:28:53.860 --> 00:29:00.159\nThere is the white circle with the green\ncheck mark, which mean it is synced but\n\n532\n00:29:00.159 --> 00:29:05.503\nif you start running low on space,\nyou can choose to move it back out\n\n533\n00:29:05.503 --> 00:29:10.766\nto the Cloud by right clicking on it and\nfreeing up space, right?\n\n534\n00:29:10.766 --> 00:29:11.898\nThis dark green or\n\n535\n00:29:11.898 --> 00:29:16.620\nthe solid green circle means it's\nalways gonna be on my local drive.\n\n536\n00:29:16.620 --> 00:29:20.022\nNow again, it's not like it's permanent.\n&gt;&gt; Not set in stone here.\n\n537\n00:29:20.022 --> 00:29:21.247\n&gt;&gt; It is not set in stone.\n\n538\n00:29:21.247 --> 00:29:25.531\nIf I right click on it,\nyou'll see I do have free up space and\n\n539\n00:29:25.531 --> 00:29:30.178\nso I can undo my decision to always\nkeep it local on this machine.\n\n540\n00:29:30.178 --> 00:29:32.910\nWhat else do we wanna know about OneDrive?\n\n541\n00:29:32.910 --> 00:29:35.420\nThat's pretty much most of the options.\n\n542\n00:29:35.420 --> 00:29:39.170\nAgain, those guys are now\nin the process of syncing.\n\n543\n00:29:39.170 --> 00:29:42.409\nThere are other options that you\ncan configure with OneDrive.\n\n544\n00:29:43.740 --> 00:29:47.367\nObviously, there's a link, most of these\nare probably not test-worthy that's why\n\n545\n00:29:47.367 --> 00:29:48.914\nI'm not going to go over all of them.\n\n546\n00:29:48.914 --> 00:29:51.200\nI talked about unlink your PC.\n\n547\n00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:55.794\nIf you have another account, like I\nhave more than one Microsoft account\n\n548\n00:29:55.794 --> 00:30:00.084\nthat I use, I can continue to add\nMicrosoft accounts and kind of, or\n\n549\n00:30:00.084 --> 00:30:03.797\ngonna bring all that stuff\ntogether in that one location.\n\n550\n00:30:03.797 --> 00:30:07.939\nOn the settings, maybe I don't\nlike this new way of doing things.\n\n551\n00:30:07.939 --> 00:30:10.835\nI want everything synced locally,\nI can undo this.\n\n552\n00:30:10.835 --> 00:30:14.124\nRemember, this is the default, so\nthis is the way it's going to start out.\n\n553\n00:30:14.124 --> 00:30:18.110\nEven noted and look like it on my machine,\nthat was because I had done this and\n\n554\n00:30:18.110 --> 00:30:20.970\nthen undone it and then did it again.\n\n555\n00:30:20.970 --> 00:30:23.380\nAnd so I remembered some of my settings\n\n556\n00:30:23.380 --> 00:30:26.500\nwith Files On-Demand is\nthe new default option.\n\n557\n00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:30.150\nDisplay notifications, when people share\nwith me or edit my shared files, so\n\n558\n00:30:30.150 --> 00:30:31.930\nif I wanna know if somebody-\n&gt;&gt; That's good to know.\n\n559\n00:30:31.930 --> 00:30:33.110\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I've shared a document with\n\n560\n00:30:33.110 --> 00:30:37.540\nCherokee, I wanna know if she's\nmade changes to it, right?\n\n561\n00:30:37.540 --> 00:30:42.060\nLet me use OneDrive to fetch any files\non my PC, this is an interesting one.\n\n562\n00:30:42.060 --> 00:30:46.870\nOneDrive can actually, basically, give you\nremote access to the entire file system,\n\n563\n00:30:46.870 --> 00:30:49.799\nnot just the files you've\nshared through OneDrive.\n\n564\n00:30:49.799 --> 00:30:50.920\n&gt;&gt; I did not know that.\n\n565\n00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:51.448\n&gt;&gt; Yes, so\n\n566\n00:30:51.448 --> 00:30:56.052\nif you have like my PC here at work and\nmy PC at home, at home if I choose this\n\n567\n00:30:56.052 --> 00:31:00.807\noption, when I go into OneDrive on my\nwork laptop, I could actually browse\n\n568\n00:31:00.807 --> 00:31:04.150\nthrough my entire hard drive at home.\n&gt;&gt; Pretty cool.\n\n569\n00:31:04.150 --> 00:31:05.099\n&gt;&gt; Which is kinda nice, yes.\n\n570\n00:31:05.099 --> 00:31:06.761\nProbably has some security implications-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n571\n00:31:06.761 --> 00:31:08.924\n&gt;&gt; Implications there that I need to worry\n\n572\n00:31:08.924 --> 00:31:11.982\nabout, but\nI just showing you the options here.\n\n573\n00:31:11.982 --> 00:31:14.790\nStart OneDrive automatically\nwhen I sign into Windows,\n\n574\n00:31:14.790 --> 00:31:16.110\nthat's probably a good thing, right?\n\n575\n00:31:16.110 --> 00:31:18.420\nThat way I don't have to\nremember to turn it on.\n\n576\n00:31:18.420 --> 00:31:21.708\nGet more storage if you want to go\nbuy more storage, you can do that.\n\n577\n00:31:21.708 --> 00:31:25.622\nAgain, choose folders that\nare available on this PC,\n\n578\n00:31:25.622 --> 00:31:28.610\nthere's some autosave options as well.\n\n579\n00:31:30.470 --> 00:31:32.870\nNetwork, if I want to adjust my,\n\n580\n00:31:32.870 --> 00:31:36.190\nmaybe the synchronization process\nis eating up my bandwidth.\n\n581\n00:31:36.190 --> 00:31:38.260\nI want to slow that down a little bit.\n\n582\n00:31:38.260 --> 00:31:40.450\nI can come in here and\ndo some limitations to that.\n\n583\n00:31:42.450 --> 00:31:46.270\nAlso file collaboration, work on Office\nfiles with other people at the same time\n\n584\n00:31:46.270 --> 00:31:48.190\nby syncing the files with Office.\n\n585\n00:31:48.190 --> 00:31:53.460\nSo if you do have that Office 365 account,\nyou can tie that in here and\n\n586\n00:31:53.460 --> 00:31:56.500\nthen of course the about page just for\nOneDrive.\n\n587\n00:31:56.500 --> 00:31:58.500\nSo that is the current state of OneDrive.\n\n588\n00:31:58.500 --> 00:32:03.718\nAgain, things are changing fast so\nif you're not using the current build,\n\n589\n00:32:03.718 --> 00:32:09.220\nthe Fall Creators Update, you might\nnot see the Files On-Demand option.\n\n590\n00:32:09.220 --> 00:32:12.618\nYou might not see that status column\nwith the Cloud and the green circle, and\n\n591\n00:32:12.618 --> 00:32:13.746\nthe solid green circle.\n\n592\n00:32:13.746 --> 00:32:15.810\nAnd If you don't, that's okay, right?\n\n593\n00:32:15.810 --> 00:32:17.696\nIt just means you haven't\nupdated Windows yet or\n\n594\n00:32:17.696 --> 00:32:19.311\nhaven't allowed that update to happen.\n\n595\n00:32:19.311 --> 00:32:21.518\nIf you do have that Fall Creators Update,\n\n596\n00:32:21.518 --> 00:32:25.130\nyou should see something more\nlike what we're seeing here.\n\n597\n00:32:25.130 --> 00:32:28.480\nWhat they're gonna test you on the exam,\nI'm not sure, all right.\n\n598\n00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:31.360\nBut I would say,\njust study the latest and greatest stuff.\n\n599\n00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:33.430\nBut now that you know it,\nplay with that option.\n\n600\n00:32:33.430 --> 00:32:35.287\nUncheck that Files On-Demand and\n\n601\n00:32:35.287 --> 00:32:38.550\nsee what it was like before\nthat option was available.\n\n602\n00:32:38.550 --> 00:32:40.570\nThat way, you got both ends covered\n\n603\n00:32:40.570 --> 00:32:42.120\non the exam.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n604\n00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:44.240\nWell, thank you for\ntaking the time to explain all of that.\n\n605\n00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:46.240\nWe really do appreciate that, Mike.\n\n606\n00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:47.760\nAnd thank you for\nhanging out with us as well.\n\n607\n00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:49.490\nBut for now, let's sign out.\n\n608\n00:32:49.490 --> 00:32:51.840\nI've been your host, Cherokee Boose.\n&gt;&gt;

00:00:12.874\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n&gt;&gt; Welcome, everyone,\n\n4\n00:00:12.874 --> 00:00:14.950\nto your Configuring Windows Devices\nseries.\n\n5\n00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:18.190\nStudying up for that 70-697 exam.\n\n6\n00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:19.813\nI'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:19.813 --> 00:00:23.413\nIn this episode, we'll be taking a look\nat how we can configure file and\n\n8\n00:00:23.413 --> 00:00:24.259\nfolder access.\n\n9\n00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:27.230\nAnd with us today in studios we have,\nMr. Mike Rodrick.\n\n10\n00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:28.894\nHow's it going today, Mike?\n&gt;&gt; It's going great today, Cherokee.\n\n11\n00:00:28.894 --> 00:00:29.552\nThanks for having me.\n\n12\n00:00:29.552 --> 00:00:31.929\nIn fact, how are you doing today?\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing wonderful,\n\n13\n00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:35.168\njust peachy.\n&gt;&gt; All right, but yeah, today we are gonna\n\n14\n00:00:35.168 --> 00:00:39.321\nbe talking about configuring files and\nfolder access, if I can say that.\n\n15\n00:00:39.321 --> 00:00:43.154\nAnd we are gonna start by looking at EFS.\n\n16\n00:00:43.154 --> 00:00:46.036\nIn no particular order,\nit's just the way the objectives come out.\n\n17\n00:00:46.036 --> 00:00:48.950\nA lot of times, I'll start with\nour file and folder permissions.\n\n18\n00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.588\nBut I thought, hey, let's just-\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] Live on the edge, Mike.\n\n19\n00:00:52.588 --> 00:00:55.803\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, let's talk about good old EFS.\n\n20\n00:00:55.803 --> 00:00:59.626\nSo first thing we should do is we\nshould define that acronym, right?\n\n21\n00:00:59.626 --> 00:01:03.010\nEFS stands for Encrypting File System.\n\n22\n00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:04.630\nAnd it's not a separate file system.\n\n23\n00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:08.094\nIt's actually part of NTFS,\nor NT File System or\n\n24\n00:01:08.094 --> 00:01:12.662\nNew Technology File System,\nif you go way back to the days of NT.\n\n25\n00:01:12.662 --> 00:01:17.067\nBut EFS, or Encrypting File System,\nis part of NTFS.\n\n26\n00:01:17.067 --> 00:01:20.747\nAnd what that means to us is it's build\nin, it's part of the file system.\n\n27\n00:01:20.747 --> 00:01:24.953\nYou don't have to add anything or\ndo anything to use EFS, or\n\n28\n00:01:24.953 --> 00:01:26.814\nEncrypting File System.\n\n29\n00:01:26.814 --> 00:01:31.153\nAnd it's used to, you'll never guess,\nencrypt files, right?\n\n30\n00:01:31.153 --> 00:01:33.710\n[LAUGH] That's its name,\nEncrypting File System.\n\n31\n00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.710\nIt encrypts files, but\nlet's break that down a little bit more.\n\n32\n00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.675\nWhen we say it encrypts files,\nwe're talking about turning that file,\n\n33\n00:01:40.675 --> 00:01:44.185\ntaking a plain text file,\nsomething that's human readable and\n\n34\n00:01:44.185 --> 00:01:46.721\nrunning it through\nan encryption algorithm.\n\n35\n00:01:46.721 --> 00:01:50.942\nAnd encrypting those contents,\nturning it into what we call ciphertext,\n\n36\n00:01:50.942 --> 00:01:53.224\nsomething that's not human readable.\n\n37\n00:01:53.224 --> 00:01:57.780\nSomething that I would need decryption\ninformation to get back into.\n\n38\n00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.433\nSo it is a way to add another layer\nof security to our documents, right?\n\n39\n00:02:02.433 --> 00:02:06.896\nThe idea is that without the proper key,\nand we'll define what a key is in just\n\n40\n00:02:06.896 --> 00:02:11.033\na minute, without the proper key\nyou're not considered authorized.\n\n41\n00:02:11.033 --> 00:02:14.226\nAnd you will not be able to decrypt\nthe file, therefore open it up and\n\n42\n00:02:14.226 --> 00:02:15.770\nread its content.\n\n43\n00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:20.150\nNow we have NTFS permissions that\nwe can use to control access, but\n\n44\n00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:25.330\nthis is again just another layer\non top of that, all right?\n\n45\n00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.670\nA few key concepts to deal with whether\nwe need to be familiar with with EFS.\n\n46\n00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.440\nOne is that it's file and\nfolder level encryption.\n\n47\n00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:37.310\nWe can encrypt individual files or\nwe can encrypt a folder.\n\n48\n00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.520\nNow, a folder is a container object.\n\n49\n00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.920\nIt's not really a file, so\nwhen you encrypt a folder,\n\n50\n00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.450\nyou're not actually\nencrypting the folder itself.\n\n51\n00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.769\nThe folder is just, think of a manilla\nfolder that you would store files in, or\n\n52\n00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:52.199\na hanging file folder in your desk, right?\n\n53\n00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:55.224\nYou can't encrypt that file folder itself,\nbut\n\n54\n00:02:55.224 --> 00:02:58.263\nwhat you can do is flag\nthat folder as encrypted.\n\n55\n00:02:58.263 --> 00:03:02.021\nAnd then any files that I put inside\nthat folder would then automatically\n\n56\n00:03:02.021 --> 00:03:02.940\nbe encrypted.\n\n57\n00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.360\nI don't have to go back and remember,\nI need to encrypt this file.\n\n58\n00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:07.565\nI need to encrypt that file.\n\n59\n00:03:07.565 --> 00:03:10.254\nI can encrypt the folder itself,\nthe container, and\n\n60\n00:03:10.254 --> 00:03:12.842\nthen everything in there\nwould become encrypted.\n\n61\n00:03:12.842 --> 00:03:16.833\nAnd another key concept, which'll\nmake a little more sense as we break\n\n62\n00:03:16.833 --> 00:03:20.958\ndown the encryption process,\nis just because I've encrypted a folder,\n\n63\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:24.830\ndoesn't mean Cherokee couldn't\nput a file in that folder.\n\n64\n00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:28.680\nAnd it would be encrypted\nusing Cherokee's information.\n\n65\n00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.460\nSo just because I encrypted the folder\ndoesn't mean everything in the folder is\n\n66\n00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:35.698\nencrypted using my information, that I'm\nthe only one that can get access to it.\n\n67\n00:03:35.698 --> 00:03:39.580\nSo again, that'll make a little more sense\nI think as we go through the process, but\n\n68\n00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:42.010\njust something to keep in mind.\n\n69\n00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.400\nIt's also transparent to the end user,\n\n70\n00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.350\nmeaning that once I've encrypted that\nfile, I don't have to do anything.\n\n71\n00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:50.070\nIf I'm the authorized user,\n\n72\n00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:52.400\nto open that file up I don't\nhave to do anything special.\n\n73\n00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.931\nI don't have to right-click on it and\ndecrypt it first or anything like that.\n\n74\n00:03:55.931 --> 00:03:58.921\nI just access the file\nlike I normally would.\n\n75\n00:03:58.921 --> 00:04:02.520\nAnd all of the decryption and\nthen encryption at the other end when I'm\n\n76\n00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:06.670\ndone with the file is done transparently\nby the file system in the background.\n\n77\n00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:08.100\nWe'll expand on that as well.\n\n78\n00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.160\nOur encryption is done through\nsomething called keys.\n\n79\n00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:16.670\nWe'll talk about those and\nhow those are done on a per user basis.\n\n80\n00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:21.090\nAt the time of this writing or\nthis shooting, it was AES-256 or\n\n81\n00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:26.170\nthe advanced encryption standard 256\nwas what was used to do the encryption.\n\n82\n00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:29.870\nAnd it's not available in Home editions.\n\n83\n00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:31.540\nThere's a really good reason for that.\n\n84\n00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:33.450\nWe're gonna show you what that is.\n\n85\n00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:36.470\nAnd users can encrypt without\nany additional rights.\n\n86\n00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:40.170\nI don't need to give somebody\npermission to encrypt files.\n\n87\n00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:44.090\nSo those are some of the key concepts that\nyou'll need especially for this exam.\n\n88\n00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:48.370\nAll of which will I think will be more\nclear as we go through our converation.\n\n89\n00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:51.310\nSo I thought, Cherokee,\nthe first thing we ought to do\n\n90\n00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:52.580\nis encrypt a file.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n91\n00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:54.110\n&gt;&gt; See what it looks like, right?\n\n92\n00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:57.690\nSo join me here on my screen, and\nI have got my Windows 10 desktop.\n\n93\n00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:01.750\nThis is a Enterprise Edition,\nbut it's not part of a domain.\n\n94\n00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:06.050\nSo this would be like if you had bought\na laptop from one of the big boxes or\n\n95\n00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:06.620\nsomebody.\n\n96\n00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:12.025\nAnd it came pre-installed with Windows 10,\nmost likely Professional, maybe Home.\n\n97\n00:05:12.025 --> 00:05:15.127\nBut remember,\nHome doesn't have the encryption features.\n\n98\n00:05:15.127 --> 00:05:18.610\nProfessional does, and Enterprise as well.\n\n99\n00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:20.770\nSo what I'm gonna do is I'm\ngonna open up File Explorer.\n\n100\n00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:22.360\nAnd I'm gonna go over to My Documents.\n\n101\n00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.910\nActually, I'm gonna make\na new folder on my C drive.\n\n102\n00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:33.432\nI'm gonna make a new folder,\nand I'll call it Project Data.\n\n103\n00:05:33.432 --> 00:05:35.875\nAnd in there, I'm gonna make a new file.\n\n104\n00:05:38.501 --> 00:05:41.430\nAnd I'm gonna call this new file.\n\n105\n00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:47.440\nLet's rename this guy to\nsomething like Plans.\n\n106\n00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:48.872\nThat's pretty cool.\n\n107\n00:05:48.872 --> 00:05:52.377\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well when I think about what I\n\n108\n00:05:52.377 --> 00:05:54.636\nthink you're gonna be thinking about,\n\n109\n00:05:54.636 --> 00:05:58.567\nI usually like to use the example of\nour secret plans to rule the world.\n\n110\n00:05:58.567 --> 00:05:59.325\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n111\n00:05:59.325 --> 00:06:00.222\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So these can be those plans.\n\n112\n00:06:00.222 --> 00:06:01.385\n&gt;&gt; This can be those secret plans, yeah.\n\n113\n00:06:01.385 --> 00:06:02.140\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n114\n00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:02.674\n&gt;&gt; Death Star plans, right?\n\n115\n00:06:02.674 --> 00:06:03.214\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n116\n00:06:03.214 --> 00:06:05.838\n&gt;&gt; This is showing you the one weakness to\n\n117\n00:06:05.838 --> 00:06:08.480\nthis multi, anyway.\n&gt;&gt; People are gonna know we're\n\n118\n00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:09.023\nweirdos now.\n\n119\n00:06:09.023 --> 00:06:10.560\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I know, we are geeks,\n\n120\n00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:13.070\nthat's why we're in this business, right?\n\n121\n00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:17.691\nAll right, and let me put in here these\n\n122\n00:06:17.691 --> 00:06:22.467\nare the secret plans to rule the world.\n\n123\n00:06:24.925 --> 00:06:28.910\nAll right, we'll save it, and\nwe'll close it, all right?\n\n124\n00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:31.790\nNow, in order for\na user to encrypt a document,\n\n125\n00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:34.720\nit's actually one of the advanced\nattributes of a file.\n\n126\n00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:38.990\nSo I'm gonna right-click on this document,\nI'm gonna go to Properties.\n\n127\n00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:42.970\nAnd on that Properties tab,\nI'm gonna look down here at the bottom,\n\n128\n00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:44.210\nright on that General tab.\n\n129\n00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:46.270\nMake sure my zooming tool's working.\n\n130\n00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:49.450\nMy General tab, down here at the bottom,\nI've got these Read-only and\n\n131\n00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:52.405\nHidden attributes, and\nI have the Advanced button.\n\n132\n00:06:52.405 --> 00:06:55.990\nIf I click Advanced,\nanother little window pops up,\n\n133\n00:06:55.990 --> 00:07:01.000\nmy Advanced attributes, one of which\nis Encrypt contents to secure data.\n\n134\n00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.330\nAnd that's the one we're gonna be using.\n\n135\n00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:04.020\nBut while I'm here, let me just point out,\n\n136\n00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:08.830\nright above that you'll see,\ncompress contents to save disk space.\n\n137\n00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:11.440\nWe don't use this anymore nowadays.\n\n138\n00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:13.390\nIt's not part of the objectives.\n\n139\n00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:15.730\nBut I do wanna make note while we're here,\n\n140\n00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:19.980\nthese two advanced attributes\nare mutually exclusive.\n\n141\n00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:24.270\nEven though they are checkmarks,\nwhich most UI etiquette says checkmarks\n\n142\n00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:27.770\nyou can check more than one,\nunderstand that both of these attributes\n\n143\n00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:31.340\nare properties of the file system and\nyou can only use one or the other.\n\n144\n00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:35.255\nIf you compress these content to save\nspace, it'll make the file smaller.\n\n145\n00:07:35.255 --> 00:07:38.475\nIf you turn around to encrypt it,\nWindows will encrypt it.\n\n146\n00:07:38.475 --> 00:07:39.385\nBut it'll decompress it.\n\n147\n00:07:39.385 --> 00:07:41.305\nIt will no longer be compressed.\n\n148\n00:07:41.305 --> 00:07:44.455\nIf it's encrypted and you try to\ncompress it, it will decrypt it.\n\n149\n00:07:44.455 --> 00:07:48.325\nIf you're the authorized user and\ntry to compress it, you can't do both.\n\n150\n00:07:48.325 --> 00:07:51.617\nAll right, so I'm gonna choose\nencrypt contents to secure data.\n\n151\n00:07:51.617 --> 00:07:55.707\nAnd I'm gonna click OK, and\nI'm gonna zoom back out.\n\n152\n00:07:55.707 --> 00:07:57.121\nAnd I'll click OK to this.\n\n153\n00:07:57.121 --> 00:08:00.110\nAnd I'm gonna get this warning, right?\n\n154\n00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:00.929\nLet's take a look at this.\n\n155\n00:08:00.929 --> 00:08:04.484\nIt's telling me that, or\nit's asking me, if I wanna\n\n156\n00:08:04.484 --> 00:08:09.760\nencrypt the folder that the parent\nfolder and the file or just the file.\n\n157\n00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:13.850\nThe recommended option is to encrypt\nthe folder as well as the file.\n\n158\n00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:17.340\nAnd there's a couple of good reasons for\nthis.\n\n159\n00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:19.140\nOne, it's easier, right?\n\n160\n00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:22.830\nAs I put files into this folder,\nthey would automatically be encrypted.\n\n161\n00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:25.910\nDon't have to worry about remembering or\ndoing anything like that.\n\n162\n00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:29.010\nThe other thing is something that you\nmight not be familiar with if you ever\n\n163\n00:08:29.010 --> 00:08:32.600\nturned on your hidden files and\nsystem files.\n\n164\n00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:35.930\nWhen you open up a document,\na text document, a word document,\n\n165\n00:08:35.930 --> 00:08:39.870\nwhat have you, a temporary copy\nof that file is made, right?\n\n166\n00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:43.300\nAnd it stored a temporary copies\nin the same place as the original.\n\n167\n00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:46.180\nIf you turn on hidden files,\nyou'll actually see it.\n\n168\n00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:48.970\nAnd the reason is,\nas you're making changes to that file,\n\n169\n00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:52.020\nat the end if you close it and\ndecide not to save it,\n\n170\n00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:55.580\nit can just throw the temporary copy away,\nthe original is still there.\n\n171\n00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:57.030\nYou choose to save your changes,\n\n172\n00:08:57.030 --> 00:09:00.810\nit's gonna merge that temporary\ncopy into the original document.\n\n173\n00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:05.330\nLong story, a long way to get back\naround at the fact that if the folder\n\n174\n00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:09.860\nis not encrypted, just the file is,\nthen that temporary copy that gets made,\n\n175\n00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:12.220\nit's actually not encrypted, all right?\n\n176\n00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:17.370\nAnd there's a slim chance that somebody\ncould try to get access to that.\n\n177\n00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:18.770\nIf the folder was encrypted,\n\n178\n00:09:18.770 --> 00:09:21.220\neven a temporary copy would have\na little bit of protection.\n\n179\n00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:23.974\nThat's the idea anyway.\n\n180\n00:09:23.974 --> 00:09:27.135\nFor this demo, I'm just gonna\nstart by encrypting, actually,\n\n181\n00:09:27.135 --> 00:09:28.460\nI'll do the recommended.\n\n182\n00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:29.650\nWe'll say encrypt the file and\n\n183\n00:09:29.650 --> 00:09:32.120\nit's parent folder.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so what you just explained,\n\n184\n00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:35.690\nit reminded me, Mike,\nabout different states of data.\n\n185\n00:09:35.690 --> 00:09:38.410\nSo would you say that EFS\nwould be applicable for\n\n186\n00:09:38.410 --> 00:09:40.834\ndata at rest?\n&gt;&gt; Yes, absolutely,\n\n187\n00:09:40.834 --> 00:09:44.674\nthis is gonna protect data while it's on\nthe file system, and that's a great point.\n\n188\n00:09:44.674 --> 00:09:47.362\nWe'll talk a little bit more about that,\nbut\n\n189\n00:09:47.362 --> 00:09:50.490\nit's only protecting\nthe data while it's on disk.\n\n190\n00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:51.960\nIt's not protecting what's in memory.\n\n191\n00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:55.161\nIt's not protecting Protecting it if\nit's traveling across the network.\n\n192\n00:09:55.161 --> 00:09:57.116\nBecause it's part of the file system,\n\n193\n00:09:57.116 --> 00:10:01.262\nit doesn't protect anything you move from\nthe file system, like to a thumb drive,\n\n194\n00:10:01.262 --> 00:10:04.281\nas an email attachment,\nto a CD-ROM or anything like that.\n\n195\n00:10:04.281 --> 00:10:05.584\nEFS will not be in effect.\n\n196\n00:10:05.584 --> 00:10:08.191\nI'll go ahead and do the file and\nthe parent folder.\n\n197\n00:10:08.191 --> 00:10:09.672\nThat is the recommendation.\n\n198\n00:10:09.672 --> 00:10:11.675\nI'll go ahead and click OK.\n\n199\n00:10:11.675 --> 00:10:13.540\nOK, all right?\n\n200\n00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:16.340\nAnd it tells me, you see immediately\nthat I get this little pop-up\n\n201\n00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:19.690\ndown in my corner that says back\nup your file encryption key.\n\n202\n00:10:19.690 --> 00:10:23.540\nThis helps avoid permanently losing\naccess to your encrypted files.\n\n203\n00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:26.469\nNow, we'll come back,\nwe'll talk about that in just a second.\n\n204\n00:10:26.469 --> 00:10:28.240\nBut I wanna show you, so\nthere is my document.\n\n205\n00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:30.220\nAnd you can see the icon has changed.\n\n206\n00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:32.980\nI've got a little lock\non top of that document.\n\n207\n00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:37.480\nThat's my indicator that it is encrypted.\n&gt;&gt; It used to just turn green, right?\n\n208\n00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:39.140\n&gt;&gt; Back in the day, yeah, blue for\n\n209\n00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:41.280\ncompressed, green for encrypted.\n\n210\n00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:42.260\nThat's still available.\n\n211\n00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:46.420\nIf you go to your View menu and\nthen Options, and then change folder and\n\n212\n00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:48.290\nsearch options.\n\n213\n00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:53.271\nAnd then, on my View tab, there is\nan option in here somewhere for show-\n\n214\n00:10:53.271 --> 00:10:55.047\n&gt;&gt; Is it like an old school button?\n\n215\n00:10:55.047 --> 00:10:56.193\n&gt;&gt; It is, show encrypted or\n\n216\n00:10:56.193 --> 00:10:57.890\ncompressed files in color.\n\n217\n00:10:57.890 --> 00:11:03.160\nAll right, and if I turn that one on, we\nshould see that the name now turns green.\n\n218\n00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:04.927\nI still see the lock icon, but\n\n219\n00:11:04.927 --> 00:11:08.404\nthe name is also green,\nindicating that it is encrypted.\n\n220\n00:11:08.404 --> 00:11:10.750\nBut this is what I meant\nby being transparent.\n\n221\n00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:14.000\nI wanna open this up, double-click,\nlook, and there's my information.\n\n222\n00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:20.836\nIf I wanna type in more information,\nstep one, map,\n\n223\n00:11:20.836 --> 00:11:22.925\nyeah, I don't know.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n224\n00:11:22.925 --> 00:11:24.876\n&gt;&gt; I'm not creative enough to come up\n\n225\n00:11:24.876 --> 00:11:29.045\nwith plans to take over the world, but\nI added some data to it, I close it,\n\n226\n00:11:29.045 --> 00:11:32.025\nI Save my changes,\nit's still encrypted, right?\n\n227\n00:11:32.025 --> 00:11:35.290\nSo that's what I mean by it's\ntransparent to the end user.\n\n228\n00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:38.790\nHere's what's happening in the background,\nthat file is residing on the hard drive,\n\n229\n00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:40.780\nand my NTFS partition.\n\n230\n00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:44.910\nWhen I double click on it,\nthe file system is decrypting the file,\n\n231\n00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:47.710\nhanding it over to the application,\nin this case Notepad.\n\n232\n00:11:47.710 --> 00:11:51.760\nNotepad is unaware of any encryption\nbecause it's decrypted before it ever gets\n\n233\n00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:52.640\nto Notepad.\n\n234\n00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:57.460\nSo Notepad opens up the file with no\nproblem, I edit it, I save my changes,\n\n235\n00:11:57.460 --> 00:11:58.520\nI close it.\n\n236\n00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:00.910\nNotepad hands it back to the file system.\n\n237\n00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:03.810\nThe file system there\nre-applies the encryption, and\n\n238\n00:12:03.810 --> 00:12:05.230\nstores it on the hard drive.\n\n239\n00:12:05.230 --> 00:12:08.260\nAgain, application is completely unaware.\n\n240\n00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:11.850\nThis is why I can work with EFS in\nany application, doesn't matter.\n\n241\n00:12:11.850 --> 00:12:16.390\nBecause the files are decrypted before\nit ever gets to the application, and\n\n242\n00:12:16.390 --> 00:12:18.660\nencrypted once the application\nis done with it.\n\n243\n00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:22.602\nSo my application doesn't have to\nbe aware of how to decrypt, or\n\n244\n00:12:22.602 --> 00:12:26.711\nhow to encrypt, or anything like that.\n&gt;&gt; Everything that you just showed us it\n\n245\n00:12:26.711 --> 00:12:28.277\nwas really not that diffcult-\n&gt;&gt; Painless,\n\n246\n00:12:28.277 --> 00:12:28.834\nright?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n247\n00:12:28.834 --> 00:12:30.160\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.\n\n248\n00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:34.280\nLet me back up one level, and\nyou'll see that my folder is also green.\n\n249\n00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:36.600\nAs I click away from it,\nthere you can see it's green.\n\n250\n00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:43.834\nSo if I make a new file, zoom out so\nI can see all my options,\n\n251\n00:12:43.834 --> 00:12:48.140\nand call this Plans Pt 2, right?\n\n252\n00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:52.070\nNotice it instantly turns greens and\nI've got my little lock,\n\n253\n00:12:52.070 --> 00:12:57.780\nthat is because I encrypted the folder\ninstead of the file itself, all right?\n\n254\n00:12:57.780 --> 00:13:03.140\nAll right, so let's talked in about,\nlet's see what happened here.\n\n255\n00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:05.550\nI'm gonna back up, and\nwe're gonna take a break.\n\n256\n00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:09.000\nAnd we're gonna talk a little\nbit about encryption in general.\n\n257\n00:13:10.245 --> 00:13:14.287\nAnd the way EFS works,\nbecause if we understand how it works,\n\n258\n00:13:14.287 --> 00:13:18.503\nwe'll understand what it is we\nneed to protect to work with EFS.\n\n259\n00:13:18.503 --> 00:13:21.334\nAnd we're gonna start,\nwe're gonna back up even further and\n\n260\n00:13:21.334 --> 00:13:25.212\ntalk about encryption in general, because\nwe need to understand what's going on.\n\n261\n00:13:25.212 --> 00:13:28.035\nWhen we talk about encryption, there's\nreally two types of encryption, Cherokee.\n\n262\n00:13:28.035 --> 00:13:32.040\nThere's symmetric encryption, and\nthere's asymmetric encryption.\n\n263\n00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:33.000\nSymmetric encryption,\n\n264\n00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:38.600\nthere's one key that does both\nthe encryption and the decryption.\n\n265\n00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:41.630\nWith asymmetric, there's two keys and\n\n266\n00:13:41.630 --> 00:13:45.320\neach one of them does its part\nin this encryption process.\n\n267\n00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:48.890\nAnd let's define keys real quick, because\nI think it's something that people,\n\n268\n00:13:48.890 --> 00:13:51.710\nwhen you say a key,\nyou're expecting like a key chain, or\n\n269\n00:13:51.710 --> 00:13:54.285\na key to put in a lock, right?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, or\n\n270\n00:13:54.285 --> 00:13:58.491\nany kind of like some people might even\nthink like those little NFC one time,\n\n271\n00:13:58.491 --> 00:14:01.240\npassword creators, or something like that.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n272\n00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:03.290\nit's really more of an analogy, right?\n\n273\n00:14:03.290 --> 00:14:05.440\nIt's a it works like a key.\n\n274\n00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:07.910\nAnd here's what we need to understand,\nthere's only so\n\n275\n00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:10.440\nmany algorithms that we\nuse in the computer world.\n\n276\n00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:11.850\nOnes that have met the standards,\n\n277\n00:14:11.850 --> 00:14:16.490\nhave been tested, that are trusted,\nand that we actually use.\n\n278\n00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:22.440\nSo if I tell you that we're all using,\nlet's just for general purposes.\n\n279\n00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:25.040\nSay, we're all using the same\nencryption algorithm.\n\n280\n00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:28.570\nBut yet, I can't access Cherokee's stuff\nand Cherokee can't access my stuff.\n\n281\n00:14:28.570 --> 00:14:30.980\nBut if we're using the same\nencryption algorithm,\n\n282\n00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:33.680\ndoesn't it seem like I should be\nable to decrypt he stuff, right?\n\n283\n00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:35.640\nI know what she encrypted it with.\n\n284\n00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:37.650\nAnd that's where the keys come into play.\n\n285\n00:14:37.650 --> 00:14:41.580\nThe keys make the algorithm unique to you,\nright?\n\n286\n00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:44.190\nYou use the algorithm\nthat everybody knows.\n\n287\n00:14:44.190 --> 00:14:48.010\nAnd your key together\nto do the encryption.\n\n288\n00:14:48.010 --> 00:14:49.310\nAnd that's what makes it unique.\n\n289\n00:14:49.310 --> 00:14:51.460\nThe key is gonna be unique to you.\n\n290\n00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:54.640\nYou get issued keys to do the encryption.\n\n291\n00:14:54.640 --> 00:15:00.370\nThink about, it'd be an analogy, think\nabout the lock on your front door, right?\n\n292\n00:15:00.370 --> 00:15:04.260\nMaybe it's made by Kwikset or\nsome other big vendor.\n\n293\n00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:07.440\nWell, there's hundreds of thousands\nof houses, and I'm just guessing,\n\n294\n00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:11.200\nI don't know how many there are,\nthat use Kwikset front door locks, right?\n\n295\n00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:13.850\nThey're all the same,\nthey're all made by the same manufacturer.\n\n296\n00:15:13.850 --> 00:15:18.040\nMy key won't open your door,\nyour key won't open my door, right?\n\n297\n00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:22.780\nSame lock, different key,\nthat makes the lock unique to you.\n\n298\n00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:25.180\nThat's the same thing you wanna\nthink about with algorithms.\n\n299\n00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:29.310\nWe're all using the same algorithm, but\nwhen I use that algorithm with my key,\n\n300\n00:15:29.310 --> 00:15:33.160\nit's different from when you use\nthe algorithm with your key, all right?\n\n301\n00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:37.110\nNow, so metric there's one key.\n\n302\n00:15:37.110 --> 00:15:39.320\nNetworks are taking\nthe encryption algorithm.\n\n303\n00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:41.540\nI take this one key that I've been issued.\n\n304\n00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:43.810\nI put them together and\nI can encrypt data.\n\n305\n00:15:43.810 --> 00:15:48.200\nWhen I want to decrypt that data,\nI take the algorithm in the same key.\n\n306\n00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:51.940\nThe key that I used to encrypted is\ngoing to be the one to decrypt it.\n\n307\n00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:53.915\nThat's symmetric,\nmeaning the same on both sides.\n\n308\n00:15:53.915 --> 00:15:56.924\nThe key is used on either\nend of the process.\n\n309\n00:15:56.924 --> 00:15:58.574\n&gt;&gt; That's how I always remembered that\n\n310\n00:15:58.574 --> 00:16:01.251\nMike, is symmetric same, right?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the same on both sides.\n\n311\n00:16:01.251 --> 00:16:04.996\nWhere as asymmetric means not\nthe same on both sides, and\n\n312\n00:16:04.996 --> 00:16:08.600\nthe way asymmetric works\nthere's gonna be a key pair.\n\n313\n00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:14.310\nThere's gonna be two keys,\nthese keys are mathematically related but\n\n314\n00:16:14.310 --> 00:16:17.440\nthey do a different,\nthey each have their own purpose.\n\n315\n00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:21.100\nAnd the way asymmetric\nworks is if you lose,\n\n316\n00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:24.600\nlets call this key A and\nkey B just for giggles.\n\n317\n00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:31.290\nIf you use key A to encrypt something,\nthe only key that can decrypt it is key B.\n\n318\n00:16:31.290 --> 00:16:34.980\nYou can't even use key A, the one you\nused to encrypt it to decrypt it.\n\n319\n00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:38.670\nYou have to have the other half of\nthe key pair to get it back out.\n\n320\n00:16:38.670 --> 00:16:39.590\nNow you could reverse it.\n\n321\n00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:42.230\nYou could have used key B to encrypt it.\n\n322\n00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:44.922\nBut then you would need\nkey A to get it back out.\n\n323\n00:16:44.922 --> 00:16:46.580\nYou always need both sides.\n\n324\n00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:48.307\nOne key does the encryption.\n\n325\n00:16:48.307 --> 00:16:50.864\nWhichever key you use\nto do the encryption,\n\n326\n00:16:50.864 --> 00:16:53.281\nthe other key has to\nbe used to decrypt it.\n\n327\n00:16:53.281 --> 00:16:54.385\nTo get it back out.\n\n328\n00:16:54.385 --> 00:16:55.076\nAll right?\n\n329\n00:16:55.076 --> 00:16:59.640\nTypically when we talk about asymmetric\nencryption we're also talking about\n\n330\n00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:00.608\ncertificates.\n\n331\n00:17:00.608 --> 00:17:05.590\nBecause when you get issued a key you'll\nbe issued what's called a key pair.\n\n332\n00:17:05.590 --> 00:17:09.240\nOne of those keys is gonna be\nattached to your certificate and\n\n333\n00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:10.960\nknown as your public key.\n\n334\n00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:14.580\nThis is a key you can\ngive to anybody freely.\n\n335\n00:17:14.580 --> 00:17:18.500\nYou want it to be, hence the name public,\nthat's why it's called that.\n\n336\n00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:21.740\nThe other half of the key pair\nwill be known as your private key.\n\n337\n00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:24.610\nThis one has to be kept safe,\nit has to be private.\n\n338\n00:17:24.610 --> 00:17:29.055\nYou're the only one that's gonna have\naccess to The private key, all right?\n\n339\n00:17:29.055 --> 00:17:32.819\nSo just in general cryptography,\nencryption type concepts.\n\n340\n00:17:32.819 --> 00:17:35.233\nNow let's talk about the way they work.\n\n341\n00:17:35.233 --> 00:17:38.854\nWith some metric encryption,\nit's the same on both sides.\n\n342\n00:17:38.854 --> 00:17:42.972\nSo let's say that Alice wants to\nsend an encrypted message to Bob, so\n\n343\n00:17:42.972 --> 00:17:46.167\nAlice takes a symmetric key,\nthis blue key here, and\n\n344\n00:17:46.167 --> 00:17:51.740\nencrypts the document, and then they're\ngonna send that document over to Bob.\n\n345\n00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:55.860\nWell, if Bob has a copy of the document,\nCherokee, what does Bob need to decrypt\n\n346\n00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:58.090\nthat document?\n&gt;&gt; The key, the symmetric key.\n\n347\n00:17:58.090 --> 00:17:59.430\n&gt;&gt; The key that I used to encrypt in\n\n348\n00:17:59.430 --> 00:18:00.310\nthe first place.\n\n349\n00:18:00.310 --> 00:18:04.740\nSo now I've got to send Bob the document,\nand I've got to send Bob the key.\n\n350\n00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:09.480\nWell, now Mr Bad Guy here is gonna\nintercept a copy of the document.\n\n351\n00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:10.950\nSo now he's got the document.\n\n352\n00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:12.200\nHe can't read it, it's encrypted.\n\n353\n00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:16.610\nBut the problem is I've got to\nsend the key to Bob as well.\n\n354\n00:18:16.610 --> 00:18:19.130\nAnd if the bad guy\nintercepted the document\n\n355\n00:18:19.130 --> 00:18:21.180\ngood chance the bad guy it's\ngonna intercept the key as well.\n\n356\n00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:24.140\nAnd he can now decrypt that document?\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely.\n\n357\n00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:24.930\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n358\n00:18:24.930 --> 00:18:27.810\nSo, this is not great we don't like this.\n\n359\n00:18:27.810 --> 00:18:30.470\nBut symmetric algorithms\nare very light weight,\n\n360\n00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:33.070\nthey don't take a lot of\nprocessing power to do,\n\n361\n00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:37.100\nbut key distribution becomes\na real issue with symmetric.\n\n362\n00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:40.430\nWith asymmetric we're gonna\nhave a key pair right,\n\n363\n00:18:40.430 --> 00:18:43.990\nnow Alice has same thing, she wants\nto send an encrypted document to Bob,\n\n364\n00:18:43.990 --> 00:18:46.480\nbut we're gonna use\nan asymmetric algorithm.\n\n365\n00:18:47.670 --> 00:18:51.220\nSo Alice has a key pair, one is public,\nit's part of her certificate,\n\n366\n00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:52.310\nthat's the green one here.\n\n367\n00:18:52.310 --> 00:18:53.389\nOne is private.\n\n368\n00:18:53.389 --> 00:18:57.088\nThis is stored in her user\nprofile in a secured location.\n\n369\n00:18:57.088 --> 00:19:00.786\nSo when she wants to send this\nencrypted document to Bob,\n\n370\n00:19:00.786 --> 00:19:03.558\nwhat she's going to do\nis not use her keys.\n\n371\n00:19:03.558 --> 00:19:05.714\nShe's going to give Bob's key.\n\n372\n00:19:05.714 --> 00:19:07.562\nBob has a public key as well.\n\n373\n00:19:07.562 --> 00:19:09.872\nAnd so, Alice asked Bob, hey Bob,\n\n374\n00:19:09.872 --> 00:19:14.630\nsend me your public Key Which he's okay\ndoing because it's the public key.\n\n375\n00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:16.180\nEverybody can have a copy.\n\n376\n00:19:16.180 --> 00:19:18.450\nAnybody can have a copy\nof your public key.\n\n377\n00:19:18.450 --> 00:19:21.710\nSo he sends over a copy of his certificate\n\n378\n00:19:21.710 --> 00:19:27.140\nwhich Alice then uses to encrypt the\ndocument and then sends it over to Bob.\n\n379\n00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:30.950\nWell if I used Bob's\npublic key to encrypt it,\n\n380\n00:19:30.950 --> 00:19:34.670\nwhat key is needed to decrypt it?\n&gt;&gt; Bob.\n\n381\n00:19:34.670 --> 00:19:36.380\n&gt;&gt; Bob's private key, right?\n\n382\n00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:37.970\nThe other half of the key pair!\n\n383\n00:19:37.970 --> 00:19:40.450\nAnd who's the only one that has hopefully-\n&gt;&gt; Hopefully.\n\n384\n00:19:40.450 --> 00:19:41.000\n&gt;&gt; Bob's\n\n385\n00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:42.380\nprivate key?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Bob!\n\n386\n00:19:42.380 --> 00:19:43.560\n&gt;&gt; Bob, right?\n\n387\n00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:48.850\nSo if bad guy intercepts the encrypted\ndocument, I don't really care.\n\n388\n00:19:48.850 --> 00:19:51.790\nBecause I'm never gonna send\nthe key needed to decrypt it.\n\n389\n00:19:51.790 --> 00:19:54.990\nHe can have a copy of the encrypt\nI should say I don't care, right?\n\n390\n00:19:54.990 --> 00:19:57.640\nThere's always ways that\nbad guys can figure out and\n\n391\n00:19:57.640 --> 00:20:01.390\nmaybe eventually you can break\nthat encryption but doubtful.\n\n392\n00:20:01.390 --> 00:20:06.340\nI wouldn't have that,\nyou can do with any certain type.\n\n393\n00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:08.060\nBut anyway, that's another story.\n\n394\n00:20:08.060 --> 00:20:12.720\nThe point here is asymmetric encryption\nsolves that key distribution problem.\n\n395\n00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:14.620\nBecause now I don't need\nto send the private key.\n\n396\n00:20:14.620 --> 00:20:18.530\nI can simply use Bob's public\nkey to do the encryption and\n\n397\n00:20:18.530 --> 00:20:22.370\nthen he can decrypt it all he wants\nonce he gets it using his private key.\n\n398\n00:20:22.370 --> 00:20:25.270\nAnd if anybody else got a copy\nof the encrypted document\n\n399\n00:20:25.270 --> 00:20:26.780\nwe should be safe, all right?\n\n400\n00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:29.740\nAgain, a little drawn out\non the explanation but\n\n401\n00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:34.590\nhopefully that helps us understand\nsymmetric and asymmetric encryption.\n\n402\n00:20:34.590 --> 00:20:38.830\nAnd the reason I do that is,\nbecause EFS uses both.\n\n403\n00:20:38.830 --> 00:20:41.330\nEFS actually uses symmetric encryption\n\n404\n00:20:41.330 --> 00:20:45.010\nas well as asymmetric encryption\nto keep our data safe.\n\n405\n00:20:45.010 --> 00:20:49.280\nAnd that is what we need to understand, so\nwe can figure out how encryption works.\n\n406\n00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:53.650\nAnd how recovery agents work, cuz that's\nsomething we haven't talked about yet, for\n\n407\n00:20:53.650 --> 00:20:56.520\nthis exam.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, Mike, so it seems pretty easy\n\n408\n00:20:56.520 --> 00:20:59.650\nlike Windows is actually handling\neverything behind the scenes.\n\n409\n00:20:59.650 --> 00:21:03.860\nSo are there any concerns you know of\nas far as an end-user's concerned?\n\n410\n00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:05.420\n&gt;&gt; That's a great question, Cherokee, and\n\n411\n00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:05.960\nthere really are.\n\n412\n00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:07.480\nAnd this is one of the reasons,\nremember we said,\n\n413\n00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:10.290\nit's not available in your home editions.\n\n414\n00:21:10.290 --> 00:21:11.510\nAnd this is why.\n\n415\n00:21:11.510 --> 00:21:12.890\nLet's look at my screen here.\n\n416\n00:21:12.890 --> 00:21:15.170\nI've got another drawing\nwe're gonna peek at.\n\n417\n00:21:15.170 --> 00:21:15.830\nSome are other ones.\n\n418\n00:21:15.830 --> 00:21:17.700\nSo, same scenario, right.\n\n419\n00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:22.660\nAlice here has encrypted a document and we\nknow that whole process that went through.\n\n420\n00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:27.810\nWhat would happen if Alice\nloses her private key?\n\n421\n00:21:27.810 --> 00:21:28.690\nAll right?\n\n422\n00:21:28.690 --> 00:21:29.720\nLets think about that for a second.\n\n423\n00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:30.500\nWhat do you think Cherokee?\n\n424\n00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:32.930\nIs it gonna be a good day for Alice?\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n425\n00:21:32.930 --> 00:21:34.870\nI've been Alice before.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Have you?\n\n426\n00:21:34.870 --> 00:21:36.580\n&gt;&gt; Well not with my actual private key,\n\n427\n00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:37.332\nbut my real.\n\n428\n00:21:37.332 --> 00:21:39.450\nKeys car.\n\n429\n00:21:39.450 --> 00:21:40.240\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n430\n00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:41.250\n&gt;&gt; And with these keys,\n\n431\n00:21:41.250 --> 00:21:44.700\nyou can't really put one of those\nclappers on there to help you find them.\n\n432\n00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:47.230\nYes, it's not gonna work, is it?\n\n433\n00:21:47.230 --> 00:21:50.920\nSo let's think about what's\ngonna happen to private key.\n\n434\n00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:53.150\nRemember, it's the other\nhalf of the key pair.\n\n435\n00:21:53.150 --> 00:21:58.760\nThe key I need to decrypt the document\nis encrypted with the public key.\n\n436\n00:21:58.760 --> 00:22:00.480\nI need the private key to decrypt that.\n\n437\n00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:03.280\nAnd if I don't have the private key,\nthat's it.\n\n438\n00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:04.670\nI cannot decrypt this.\n\n439\n00:22:04.670 --> 00:22:08.220\nThere is no way that I'm gonna\nbe able to decrypt that DDF,\n\n440\n00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:13.040\nthe data decryption field,\nto retrieve the symmetric key, or\n\n441\n00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:16.390\nthe data decryption key,\nto decrypt this document.\n\n442\n00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:17.990\nI'm done, that's it.\n\n443\n00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:21.970\nAnd this why again it's not available in\nhome editions cuz Microsoft doesn't want\n\n444\n00:22:21.970 --> 00:22:25.550\nto deal with the phone calls right of hey,\nI've encrypted all my pictures, for\n\n445\n00:22:25.550 --> 00:22:29.970\nsome reason you had to protect your\npictures, and now I've lost the key and\n\n446\n00:22:29.970 --> 00:22:31.010\nwhat are you gonna do?\n\n447\n00:22:31.010 --> 00:22:33.180\nAnd Microsoft's gonna tell\nyou they can't do anything.\n\n448\n00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:35.510\nThere is nothing that can be done.\n\n449\n00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:37.531\nAnd well how are you gonna lose your key?\n\n450\n00:22:37.531 --> 00:22:41.100\nYou said it was stored in a secure\nlocation on your hard drive inside your\n\n451\n00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:41.874\nuser profile.\n\n452\n00:22:41.874 --> 00:22:44.618\nHave you ever lost a profile Cherokee?\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\n\n453\n00:22:44.618 --> 00:22:45.386\nI have.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n454\n00:22:45.386 --> 00:22:49.088\nCorruption happens, right?\n&gt;&gt; I've lost entire hard disk drives\n\n455\n00:22:49.088 --> 00:22:49.912\nbefore.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n456\n00:22:49.912 --> 00:22:51.221\nYour hard drive can fail.\n\n457\n00:22:51.221 --> 00:22:52.947\nYour profile can become corrupt.\n\n458\n00:22:52.947 --> 00:22:55.600\nSomebody could accidentally\ndelete your profile.\n\n459\n00:22:55.600 --> 00:23:00.135\nAny number of things could happen and\ncause you to lose your private key and\n\n460\n00:23:00.135 --> 00:23:01.599\nlike I said that's it.\n\n461\n00:23:01.599 --> 00:23:06.427\nYou will not get back into this files,\nyou've got to have a backup of that key.\n\n462\n00:23:06.427 --> 00:23:10.320\nRemember when Windows prompted\nme to back up that key.\n\n463\n00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:13.430\nThat's why, because it's the only back in.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n464\n00:23:13.430 --> 00:23:18.260\nif you put in removable media like a flash\ndrive, make sure you label it so that\n\n465\n00:23:18.260 --> 00:23:22.560\nyou're not just like use this flash drive\none day, and then it gets rewritten or\n\n466\n00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:24.986\nsomething like that.\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, I've been there, done that.\n\n467\n00:23:24.986 --> 00:23:25.621\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n468\n00:23:25.621 --> 00:23:28.300\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Unfortunately, right?\n\n469\n00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:30.220\nAnd keep that safe right?\n\n470\n00:23:30.220 --> 00:23:31.320\nThink about that.\n\n471\n00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:34.240\nIf you do put that on a thumb drive and\nyou leave that thumb drive laying around.\n\n472\n00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:38.020\nIf I can get ahold of that thumb\ndrive that has your private key\n\n473\n00:23:38.020 --> 00:23:41.220\nI can import your private\nkey into my profile.\n\n474\n00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:44.090\nNow when I double click on\nyour encrypted documents\n\n475\n00:23:44.090 --> 00:23:48.750\nit goes look your key works because I have\nstolen your key and it's in my profile.\n\n476\n00:23:48.750 --> 00:23:51.900\nAnd I can decrypt everything\nyou've ever encrypted.\n\n477\n00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:54.510\nSo, you have to back that key up, and\n\n478\n00:23:54.510 --> 00:23:58.280\nyou have to keep it safe,\nagain in a non-domain environment.\n\n479\n00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:01.950\nThat's where we wanna start.\n\n480\n00:24:01.950 --> 00:24:07.110\nNow, the next thing we wanna talk about\nwith EFS is, how do we make this better?\n\n481\n00:24:07.110 --> 00:24:09.430\nHow do I use this in a domain environment?\n\n482\n00:24:09.430 --> 00:24:11.990\nThis can't be the way it's done,\nand it's not.\n\n483\n00:24:11.990 --> 00:24:13.990\nAll right.\nWe have something known as data recovery\n\n484\n00:24:13.990 --> 00:24:15.680\nagents, in a domain environment.\n\n485\n00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:16.820\nAnd you can set these up,\n\n486\n00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:19.700\nyou can set up a recovery agent\noutside of a domain environment.\n\n487\n00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:21.600\nIt just involves a lot,\nit's typically not done.\n\n488\n00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:23.440\nBut that's where we're going to go next.\n\n489\n00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:26.480\nBut I know I've babbled on and\nrun us out of time for\n\n490\n00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:29.880\nthis particular episode haven't I?\n&gt;&gt; Well that's a lot of encryption talk\n\n491\n00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:30.900\nfor one show Mike.\n\n492\n00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:32.355\nBut I don't think we're finished yet.\n\n493\n00:24:32.355 --> 00:24:33.190\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No, no, no.\n\n494\n00:24:33.190 --> 00:24:34.040\n&gt;&gt; Ladies and\n\n495\n00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:35.820\ngentlemen you don't want to\nmiss what's coming your way,\n\n496\n00:24:35.820 --> 00:24:37.650\nbut for now let's sign out.\n\n497\n00:24:37.650 --> 00:24:39.930\nI've been you host Cherokee Boose.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n498\n00:24:39.930 --> 00:24:45.340\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITPRO.TV.\n\n499\n00:24:45.340 --> 00:24:49.006\n[MUSIC]\n\n500\n00:24:49.006 --> 00:24:51.152\n&gt;&gt; Thank you

00:00:08.237\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.237 --> 00:00:11.817\n&gt;&gt; Your watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.817 --> 00:00:16.080\n&gt;&gt; Welcome everyone to your Configuring\nWindows Devices series, studying for\n\n6\n00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.060\nthat 70- 697 exam.\n\n7\n00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.136\nI'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n8\n00:00:19.136 --> 00:00:23.888\nThis is actually a part two, where we will\ncontinue taking a look at our file and\n\n9\n00:00:23.888 --> 00:00:24.900\nfolder access.\n\n10\n00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.030\nAnd with us today,\nof course back in studios, we have Mr.\n\n11\n00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:29.836\nMike Rodrick, how's it going, Mike?\n\n12\n00:00:29.836 --> 00:00:31.796\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic, Cherokee, excited as always.\n\n13\n00:00:31.796 --> 00:00:33.288\nTalking about encryption and-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you sure weren't you?\n\n14\n00:00:33.288 --> 00:00:33.938\n&gt;&gt; And all kinds of good stuff.\n\n15\n00:00:33.938 --> 00:00:35.126\n&gt;&gt; In that last episode.\n\n16\n00:00:35.126 --> 00:00:37.483\n&gt;&gt; And it's exciting,\nit's good stuff, right?\n\n17\n00:00:37.483 --> 00:00:38.510\n&gt;&gt; It is exciting.\n\n18\n00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:39.970\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\nlet's pick up where we left off.\n\n19\n00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:44.000\nWe had just finished\ntalking about what EFS was.\n\n20\n00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.690\nWe talked about how it breaks down,\nhow it uses symmetric and\n\n21\n00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.740\nasymmetric encryption\nto protect your data.\n\n22\n00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:52.740\nWe saw the symmetric keys\nused to encrypt the document,\n\n23\n00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:56.810\nthe asymmetric key pairs used\nto encrypt the symmetric key.\n\n24\n00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:02.110\nWe talked also a little bit about some of\nthe issues you can run into with EFS and\n\n25\n00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:05.240\nthe fact that if I lose that private key,\n\n26\n00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:08.140\nI lose access to all of\nmy encrypted documents.\n\n27\n00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.680\nThere isn't any way to get\nback into those documents.\n\n28\n00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.400\nSo it's actually gonna be a bad day for\nyou.\n\n29\n00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:20.520\nSo, let's talk about a couple things where\nwe see this in the Enterprise environment.\n\n30\n00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.340\nHow we try to keep everybody safe, right?\n\n31\n00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.810\nBecause we're okay with\nusers encrypting their data.\n\n32\n00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:27.970\nI mean that's a good thing.\n\n33\n00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.040\nIt's another layer of security.\n\n34\n00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.830\nBut what I don't want to have happen is,\nsomebody come to me and\n\n35\n00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:34.680\nsay look I encrypted all this stuff.\n\n36\n00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.259\nI have lost my key, please help me, right?\n\n37\n00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.942\nBecause we're gonna hope\nwe have a backup or\n\n38\n00:01:39.942 --> 00:01:43.361\nsomething because we're not\ngetting back into those.\n\n39\n00:01:43.361 --> 00:01:46.545\n&gt;&gt; Did you hear about the guy\nwho lost his Bitcoin wallet key?\n\n40\n00:01:46.545 --> 00:01:47.361\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n41\n00:01:47.361 --> 00:01:48.494\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n42\n00:01:48.494 --> 00:01:49.350\n&gt;&gt; That's a bad day.\n\n43\n00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.106\n&gt;&gt; It was a couple million dollars gone.\n\n44\n00:01:51.106 --> 00:01:52.596\n&gt;&gt; [SOUND] That's gonna sting.\n\n45\n00:01:52.596 --> 00:01:54.262\n&gt;&gt; Gone forever [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\n\n46\n00:01:54.262 --> 00:01:56.487\nthat's what we don't want, right?\n\n47\n00:01:56.487 --> 00:01:58.390\nWe want to avoid that.\n\n48\n00:01:58.390 --> 00:01:59.620\nBut how can we do that, right?\n\n49\n00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:02.450\nIf you don't back up that key,\nyou're running an Enterprise environment.\n\n50\n00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.862\nAm I going to trust that all of my users\nare backing up their keys properly,\n\n51\n00:02:06.862 --> 00:02:09.230\nthst they're keeping those keys safe.\n\n52\n00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:11.200\nAnd here's the thing about EFS.\n\n53\n00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.350\nNot only can I encrypt files\non my local machine, but\n\n54\n00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.790\nany place that has an NTFS partition.\n\n55\n00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.200\nSo I could connect to a file share, and I\ncould encrypt all those documents up there\n\n56\n00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.582\nby default,\nif you haven't made any changes, right?\n\n57\n00:02:23.582 --> 00:02:26.460\nWhat's to say,\nwhat's to keep a disgruntled employee\n\n58\n00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:29.050\nfrom realizing that hey,\nI'm gonna quit tomorrow.\n\n59\n00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.850\nOr I think I'm gonna get fired, let me go\nto every share that I can on the company's\n\n60\n00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.650\nnetwork, encrypt all the documents.\n\n61\n00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.100\nAnd then format my hard drive and\nwalk out, right?\n\n62\n00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.268\n&gt;&gt; Rubbage.\n&gt;&gt; Try to burn my private key and leave.\n\n63\n00:02:40.268 --> 00:02:41.065\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n64\n00:02:41.065 --> 00:02:45.895\n&gt;&gt; But that's a real consideration,\nsomething that we've gotta worry about.\n\n65\n00:02:45.895 --> 00:02:48.795\nWhich is why in an Enterprise environment,\nby default,\n\n66\n00:02:48.795 --> 00:02:52.785\nwe have something known as a data\nrecovery agent, all right?\n\n67\n00:02:52.785 --> 00:02:56.175\nWe're gonna talk about a recovery\nagent and how it works.\n\n68\n00:02:56.175 --> 00:03:00.180\nWe also should be aware that\nin a domain environment\n\n69\n00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.350\ntypically we're gonna issue\nthe certificates to our users.\n\n70\n00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.990\nAnd this is something that you have\nto think about as an organization.\n\n71\n00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:08.720\nIf you're going to allow the use of EFS,\n\n72\n00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.018\nif you're not gonna disable it,\nbecause it is enabled by default.\n\n73\n00:03:12.018 --> 00:03:16.650\nIf you're gonna allow the use of EFS,\nthen you need to plan ahead.\n\n74\n00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:21.960\nAnd one of those plans has to be\nlet's issue keys to our users,\n\n75\n00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:26.080\nrather than those self-signed\ncertificates that you saw issued by Joe,\n\n76\n00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.700\nissued to Joe,\nthat's a self-signed certificate.\n\n77\n00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.910\nI have no way to manage that certificate.\n\n78\n00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:33.120\nBut in a corporate environment,\n\n79\n00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.470\nI can run a certificate server,\na certificate authority.\n\n80\n00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:39.120\nAnd I can issue certificates\nto all my users.\n\n81\n00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.091\nAnd I can back up those certificates at\nthe time of issuing, because I know my\n\n82\n00:03:43.091 --> 00:03:46.688\nusers might or might not get a good\nidea that they probably won't do,\n\n83\n00:03:46.688 --> 00:03:49.820\nthat everything they need to\nkeep that certificate safe.\n\n84\n00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:51.630\nRight, and that private key safe.\n\n85\n00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:54.619\nSo that's the first thing is plan, and\n\n86\n00:03:54.619 --> 00:03:59.247\nmake sure we are issuing trusted\ncertificates to our users.\n\n87\n00:03:59.247 --> 00:04:03.197\nThe second part is to use\na data recovery agent, which,\n\n88\n00:04:03.197 --> 00:04:08.380\nin a domain environment, is built in or\nis turned on by default.\n\n89\n00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:10.850\nThe built-in domain administrator account.\n\n90\n00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:17.090\nAdministrator, that built-in account,\nthat is by default the recovery agent.\n\n91\n00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:20.250\nAnd a recovery agent can decrypt\n\n92\n00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:24.030\nany file that's been encrypted\nwhile they were the recovery agent.\n\n93\n00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:27.035\nThat's the way it works.\n\n94\n00:04:27.035 --> 00:04:28.860\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; But, that's a good thing.\n\n95\n00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:33.096\nThat means if I have encrypted documents,\nand I somehow lost my profile, or\n\n96\n00:04:33.096 --> 00:04:36.950\nlost my private key, I can no longer\ngain access to those documents.\n\n97\n00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:39.293\nI can go to the data recovery agent, and\n\n98\n00:04:39.293 --> 00:04:42.283\nI can say hey look I can't\ndecrypt these anymore.\n\n99\n00:04:42.283 --> 00:04:44.766\nThe data recovery agent\ncan decrypt them for me.\n\n100\n00:04:44.766 --> 00:04:47.178\nNow they're all decrypted, plain text,\n\n101\n00:04:47.178 --> 00:04:51.064\ni can get a new key pair issued to me\nto replace the ones I've lost, and\n\n102\n00:04:51.064 --> 00:04:54.621\nI can encrypt the documents again and\nwe're back in business.\n\n103\n00:04:54.621 --> 00:04:56.778\nThat's the idea behind a recovery agent.\n\n104\n00:04:56.778 --> 00:04:58.293\nLets see how it works.\n\n105\n00:04:58.293 --> 00:05:00.190\nJoin me on my screen here.\n\n106\n00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:02.260\nSo we remember with the way EFS works,\nright.\n\n107\n00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:06.333\nSymmetric key, and\nI have since removed her private key, but\n\n108\n00:05:06.333 --> 00:05:09.030\nAlice has a public private key pair.\n\n109\n00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:11.260\nShe's the only one that\ncan decrypt this document.\n\n110\n00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.670\nThis is your work group\nenvironment scenario.\n\n111\n00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:16.580\nWe go over here in a domain environment,\nwe're gonna change it up a little bit.\n\n112\n00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:19.420\nAnd I'm gonna try to zoom in here so\nyou can see everything.\n\n113\n00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:23.738\nSo on this left side, same process,\na house wants to encrypt this document.\n\n114\n00:05:23.738 --> 00:05:28.445\nWindows generates a symmetric key,\nputs it in the data decryption field,\n\n115\n00:05:28.445 --> 00:05:32.492\nuses Alice's public key to encrypt\nthe data encryption field.\n\n116\n00:05:32.492 --> 00:05:35.794\nSo now her private key can decrypt\nthe data decryption field,\n\n117\n00:05:35.794 --> 00:05:39.980\nretrieve a copy of the symmetric key,\nand decrypt the document.\n\n118\n00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:41.190\nThat's a lot of talking.\n\n119\n00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:41.863\n&gt;&gt; That is.\n\n120\n00:05:41.863 --> 00:05:46.988\n&gt;&gt; But\nif Alice was to lose her private key.\n\n121\n00:05:46.988 --> 00:05:51.363\nBecause we had a recovery agent set up,\nwhen Alice encrypted this,\n\n122\n00:05:51.363 --> 00:05:54.380\nWindows did something really cool.\n\n123\n00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:57.370\nIt took a second copy of\nthe symmetric key and\n\n124\n00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:01.072\nput it in what's known as\nthe data recovery field, the DRF.\n\n125\n00:06:01.072 --> 00:06:05.570\nIt's a second hidden field or\nheader to this document, and\n\n126\n00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:11.230\nuse the recovery agent's\npublic key to encrypt the DRF.\n\n127\n00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:16.899\nSo, Alice can decrypt this field and\nretrieve the symmetric key.\n\n128\n00:06:16.899 --> 00:06:21.932\nBut if she loses her private key and\ncan no longer retrieve the symmetric key,\n\n129\n00:06:21.932 --> 00:06:24.590\nthe recovery agent can be called.\n\n130\n00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:27.440\nHe can take his private key or\nher private key and\n\n131\n00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:32.850\ndecrypt the DRF, retrieve a copy of the\nsymmetric key and decrypt the document.\n\n132\n00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:34.160\nHow's that, right?\n\n133\n00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:35.711\nIt's like a little safety net or a backup.\n\n134\n00:06:35.711 --> 00:06:40.223\nSomebody else can get into those\nencrypted documents if you end up\n\n135\n00:06:40.223 --> 00:06:43.430\nlosing access to those\nencrypted documents.\n\n136\n00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:47.590\n&gt;&gt; And my favorite part about everything\nyou just explained to us Mike was that\n\n137\n00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:49.460\nit's, all these functionalities, or\n\n138\n00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:53.080\nthese features are integrated\ninto Windows Operating Systems.\n\n139\n00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:55.800\nAnd I don't have to, you know,\nget with a third party and\n\n140\n00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:57.320\nhave an additional expense here.\n\n141\n00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:58.685\nSo that's my favorite part.\n\n142\n00:06:58.685 --> 00:06:59.850\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n143\n00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:00.850\nAll right.\n\n144\n00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:03.450\nI love, yeah anything free is\nalways a good price, right?\n\n145\n00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:06.840\nAll right, so if we go back\nover here to my Windows 10 box.\n\n146\n00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:08.934\nThe one we just encrypted that file on.\n\n147\n00:07:08.934 --> 00:07:10.760\nI'm gonna pull that file back up.\n\n148\n00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:12.790\nWe'll just do plans.\n\n149\n00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:14.200\nThat's right here on my shortcut list.\n\n150\n00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:18.234\nI'm gonna pull up Properties, and\nI'm gonna go to that advanced attributes,\n\n151\n00:07:18.234 --> 00:07:19.749\nwhere we did the encryption.\n\n152\n00:07:19.749 --> 00:07:21.985\nAnd I'm gonna click Details.\n\n153\n00:07:21.985 --> 00:07:25.410\nThis Details button doesn't\nlight up until you've clicked OK\n\n154\n00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:26.700\nto encrypt it in the first place.\n\n155\n00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:29.590\nAnd then if you go back into\nthe properties you'll see Details.\n\n156\n00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:34.110\nAnd you'll see That it says\nusers who can access this file.\n\n157\n00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:34.900\nJoe, right?\n\n158\n00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:35.940\nHe's the one that encrypted it.\n\n159\n00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:37.670\nThat's who I'm logged on as.\n\n160\n00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:39.890\nRecovery, nothing.\n\n161\n00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:40.970\nThere's nobody.\n\n162\n00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:45.170\nSo if Joe loses his key,\nJoe loses access to these documents.\n\n163\n00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:49.790\nNow let's head over to a domain\nenvironment and see what's going on.\n\n164\n00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:56.990\nAll right, so we're gonna flip over\nto one of my domain machines here,\n\n165\n00:07:56.990 --> 00:08:00.197\nand I am going to Encrypted document.\n\n166\n00:08:00.197 --> 00:08:03.460\nSo I'm going to, just go to my,\nlet's go to the E drive here.\n\n167\n00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:04.790\nI got that project data folder.\n\n168\n00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:06.140\nLet's encrypt all this fun stuff.\n\n169\n00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:12.190\nSo I'm going to right click Properties,\nactually,\n\n170\n00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:17.050\nyou know what, before I do that,\nlet's check something real quick.\n\n171\n00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:19.361\nIf I take a look at my certs, All right,\n\n172\n00:08:19.361 --> 00:08:22.328\njust like we did with Joe\non that other machine.\n\n173\n00:08:22.328 --> 00:08:26.482\nNotice that I have a certificate\nissued to me already, all right?\n\n174\n00:08:26.482 --> 00:08:29.449\nNow this is done through group policy,\nright?\n\n175\n00:08:29.449 --> 00:08:33.380\nAnd this is something we'll talk\nabout in our server classes.\n\n176\n00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:36.050\nBut this organization, my test lab here.\n\n177\n00:08:36.050 --> 00:08:40.880\nI've set it up so that users automatically\nget Certificates issued to them\n\n178\n00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:42.520\nthe next time they log on, right?\n\n179\n00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:45.750\nOnce you create that group policy, and\nthis is what I was talking about earlier,\n\n180\n00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:46.810\nplanning ahead, right?\n\n181\n00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:51.050\nI have a certificate authority set up,\nand group policy says,\n\n182\n00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:55.380\nas soon as a user logs on,\nthey're going to get issued a certificate.\n\n183\n00:08:55.380 --> 00:09:00.398\nAnd that certificate is good for\nIn this case provide your identity,\n\n184\n00:09:00.398 --> 00:09:04.563\nprotect email message and allows data\non disk to be encrypted, all right.\n\n185\n00:09:04.563 --> 00:09:08.926\nNow this is beyond what we're gonna talk\nabout here in this particular class.\n\n186\n00:09:08.926 --> 00:09:12.563\nWe started talking about certificates and\nintended purposes and\n\n187\n00:09:12.563 --> 00:09:15.009\nmanaging those certificates and all that.\n\n188\n00:09:15.009 --> 00:09:18.100\nMake sure you check out\nour server MCSA classes.\n\n189\n00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:19.670\nAnd we'll cover that, all right?\n\n190\n00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:22.500\nFor this class, we're just gonna assume\nthat the server end of things is\n\n191\n00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:26.810\ntaken care of, and it looks like it is,\nbecause I'm getting issued a certificate.\n\n192\n00:09:26.810 --> 00:09:30.850\nAnd this is, again, this is the name\nof my certificate authority, rootCA.\n\n193\n00:09:30.850 --> 00:09:33.020\nIt's not a self-signed certificate,\nall right?\n\n194\n00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:36.290\nThis is one that's issued by\nmy certificate authority.\n\n195\n00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:43.640\nSo if I go and right-click and I pull up\nthe properties, and I choose advanced,\n\n196\n00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:49.010\nand I encrypt contents to secure data and\nI click okay, and I click okay.\n\n197\n00:09:49.010 --> 00:09:51.110\nI'll do it to the folder and\nall the subfiles, that's fine.\n\n198\n00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:54.060\nAll right.\n\n199\n00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:56.780\nAnd now, if I go back and\nlook at the properties,\n\n200\n00:09:56.780 --> 00:10:02.100\nlet's say of one of these documents,\nnow that they're encrypted and\n\n201\n00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:07.030\ntake a look at the advanced attributes and\nthen details for encryption.\n\n202\n00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:09.822\nWe'll see it's a little different here,\nright?\n\n203\n00:10:09.822 --> 00:10:13.485\nWell there's that, I'm able to access it,\nbecause I'm the one that encrypted it.\n\n204\n00:10:13.485 --> 00:10:17.275\nBut also notice that administrator,\nand well my account,\n\n205\n00:10:17.275 --> 00:10:21.225\nbecause I'm the enterprise admin,\nis also listed as the recovery agent.\n\n206\n00:10:21.225 --> 00:10:23.635\nAnd you can actually see it's\na different certificate.\n\n207\n00:10:23.635 --> 00:10:28.085\nYou look closely, F2DC versus 017E.\n\n208\n00:10:28.085 --> 00:10:31.610\nThis is my typical user\ncertificate up here.\n\n209\n00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:35.580\nThis happens to be because I am the\nrecovery agent for my test environment.\n\n210\n00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:37.600\nSo maybe I should have\nlogged on as somebody else.\n\n211\n00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:42.610\nBut the point is I can see\nthat if I lose my certificate,\n\n212\n00:10:42.610 --> 00:10:45.020\nsomebody else is gonna be able\nto get into these documents.\n\n213\n00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:49.990\nSomebody will be able to decrypt them so\nthat we haven't lost that information.\n\n214\n00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:50.550\nAll together.\n\n215\n00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:52.360\nRight?\n\n216\n00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:55.630\nThat is what a recovery\nagent is all about.\n\n217\n00:10:55.630 --> 00:10:56.690\nNow we see that.\n\n218\n00:10:58.090 --> 00:11:00.380\nI go back over to my domain controller.\n\n219\n00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:02.540\nAnd I know this is really isn't\nthe server side of things.\n\n220\n00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:06.630\nBut they might ask you about how you\nwould configure recovery agent because it\n\n221\n00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:08.360\nis part of the objectives.\n\n222\n00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:09.408\nGroup policy management.\n\n223\n00:11:12.332 --> 00:11:14.590\nAnd it takes a minute to\nopen up group policy.\n\n224\n00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:16.000\nThere we go.\nAnd\n\n225\n00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.330\nI'm going to pull up my\ndefault domain policy.\n\n226\n00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:20.220\nI'll just edit that.\n\n227\n00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:27.760\nAnd in here,\nI'm going to expand out policies, gosh.\n\n228\n00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:28.836\nWindows settings.\n\n229\n00:11:30.253 --> 00:11:34.995\nAnd in Security Settings, and\nthen Public Key Policies,\n\n230\n00:11:34.995 --> 00:11:37.802\nand then Encrypting File System.\n\n231\n00:11:37.802 --> 00:11:41.478\nAnd this is where we\nassign a recovery agent.\n\n232\n00:11:41.478 --> 00:11:45.932\nSo there's actually two\nrecovery agents currently.\n\n233\n00:11:45.932 --> 00:11:49.110\nThe first one was the default one.\n\n234\n00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:53.010\nBuilt in administrator but\nnotice it's a self sign certificate,\n\n235\n00:11:53.010 --> 00:11:57.110\nthis is built into Active, or this is\npart of installing Active Directory,\n\n236\n00:11:57.110 --> 00:12:00.400\nit takes the built in administrator\naccount and makes them the recovery agent,\n\n237\n00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:03.530\nbut this is before I've ever installed\na a certificate authority, right,\n\n238\n00:12:03.530 --> 00:12:06.540\nthis is when I installed active directory,\nthere was no certificate authority,\n\n239\n00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:10.510\nI was still setting up the network, and\nwe haven't planned on using Certificates,\n\n240\n00:12:10.510 --> 00:12:11.520\nthey were just not selling it.\n\n241\n00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:16.680\nSo the point is in a domain environment\nthere's always a recovery agent.\n\n242\n00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:20.480\nEven straight out of the box\nthe administrator account is gonna be\n\n243\n00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:23.020\nthe recovery agent.\n\n244\n00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:27.400\nBest practice is to change that, we don't\nwanna leave that as the recovery agent.\n\n245\n00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:29.810\nAnd that's because it's\nthe built in admin account.\n\n246\n00:12:29.810 --> 00:12:34.060\nThink about your network that you work at,\nif you're currently working in this field.\n\n247\n00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:38.190\nHow many people have the passwords of\nthe built in administrator account?\n\n248\n00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:39.720\nProbably\n&gt;&gt; Probably more than you want.\n\n249\n00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:42.620\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\nprobably a good chunk of your IT staff\n\n250\n00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:45.250\ncould log on as the IT\nadministrator if they need to.\n\n251\n00:12:45.250 --> 00:12:46.700\nThey go, what's the big deal?\n\n252\n00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:49.010\nThey have access to all of our machines so\n\n253\n00:12:49.010 --> 00:12:51.370\nthat they can figure\nthings when they need to.\n\n254\n00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:53.830\nYeah, and install whatever, right?\n\n255\n00:12:53.830 --> 00:12:59.960\nWell, the recovery agent can decrypt\nany encrypted information, right?\n\n256\n00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:03.960\nThat means if the CEO was\nencrypting stuff, the recovery,\n\n257\n00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:06.520\nanybody with built-in\nadminister cal password.\n\n258\n00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:08.710\nCan log in and decrypt that information.\n\n259\n00:13:08.710 --> 00:13:11.160\nThat probably was not part of your plans,\nright?\n\n260\n00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:14.970\nThere's gonna be some stuff\nthat even as a trusted IT\n\n261\n00:13:14.970 --> 00:13:17.910\nadmin that you shouldn't have access to,\nright?\n\n262\n00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:21.600\nIt's gonna be outside of your job role or\nnot pertaining to you.\n\n263\n00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:24.610\nRegulations, industry regulations,\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n264\n00:13:24.610 --> 00:13:30.150\nSo the recommended practice is create\nan account just for data recovery.\n\n265\n00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:34.080\nI typically name mine something\nlike DRA or something simple, and\n\n266\n00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:37.100\nthen assign that as the recovery agent.\n\n267\n00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:41.750\nAnd very few people are going to have\nthe password to log in as DRA, right?\n\n268\n00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:43.710\nOnly trusted people, because, again,\n\n269\n00:13:43.710 --> 00:13:46.060\nthey can access anything\nthat has been encrypted.\n\n270\n00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:49.313\nAnother point we need to\nunderstand about the way\n\n271\n00:13:49.313 --> 00:13:54.071\nthis works is it's the recovery agent\nat the time of issuance, right?\n\n272\n00:13:54.071 --> 00:13:55.734\nSo in other words, if I,\n\n273\n00:13:55.734 --> 00:13:59.700\nlike here this one started out\nadministrator was built in.\n\n274\n00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:02.634\nI went and\nadded myself as a recovery agent.\n\n275\n00:14:02.634 --> 00:14:08.000\nThere were things that were encrypted\nbefore I was the recovery agent.\n\n276\n00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.000\nEven though I am now a recovery agent,\nI won't be able to ge into anything that\n\n277\n00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.870\nwas encrypted before I was the recovery\nagent, because my key wasn't used.\n\n278\n00:14:15.870 --> 00:14:17.730\nMy key didn't exist at that point.\n\n279\n00:14:17.730 --> 00:14:19.190\nI wasn't a recovery agent.\n\n280\n00:14:19.190 --> 00:14:22.300\nSo something to keep in mind, and this\nis where you see enterprises goofing up\n\n281\n00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:26.230\na little bit, is they'll create a new\nrecovery agent, like they're supposed to.\n\n282\n00:14:26.230 --> 00:14:29.280\nAnd then they'll delete the certificate\nfor the built-in recovery agent.\n\n283\n00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:30.760\n&gt;&gt; That's what I just gonna ask about.\n\n284\n00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:31.390\n&gt;&gt; Was it?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n285\n00:14:31.390 --> 00:14:35.330\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's not a good idea because you\ndon't know what files might still be out\n\n286\n00:14:35.330 --> 00:14:39.480\nthere, that is the only account that's\ngonna be able to get back into them.\n\n287\n00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:43.690\nSo never, back it up,\nexport the certificate and back it up and\n\n288\n00:14:43.690 --> 00:14:48.130\nput that in a safe somewhere and\nthen delete that account maybe or\n\n289\n00:14:48.130 --> 00:14:50.090\ndelete that certificate, not the account.\n\n290\n00:14:50.090 --> 00:14:51.080\nThe certificate.\n\n291\n00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:54.800\nThat way if the need ever arises,\nyou can always import that again and\n\n292\n00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:55.950\nget access to it.\n\n293\n00:14:55.950 --> 00:14:57.740\nOnes of assigned, in this case Mike,\n\n294\n00:14:57.740 --> 00:15:01.610\nas the recovery agent, everything\nthat's encrypted from that point on.\n\n295\n00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:03.290\nMike will be able to decrypt.\n\n296\n00:15:03.290 --> 00:15:07.060\nBut anything before that, I wasn't the\nrecovery agent yet, it doesn't go back and\n\n297\n00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:10.100\nautomatically update\nthe recovery agent for\n\n298\n00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:11.900\ndocuments that were encrypted in the past.\n\n299\n00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:13.750\nIt's just from that point forward.\n\n300\n00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:16.130\nSo if I ever change this, like if I\ncome in here and say you know what?\n\n301\n00:15:16.130 --> 00:15:17.930\nI don't wanna be\nthe recovery agent anymore,\n\n302\n00:15:17.930 --> 00:15:19.040\nI'm gonna make a separate account.\n\n303\n00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:24.240\nOr I'm gonna make Cherokee the recovery\nagent You wouldn't want to delete this\n\n304\n00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:29.310\none you could remove them as\nthe recovery agent from this policy but\n\n305\n00:15:29.310 --> 00:15:32.640\nyou'd want to make sure that you\nbacked up that certificate so\n\n306\n00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:36.230\nthat if their were documents out there\nthat were needed to be recovered you\n\n307\n00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:38.370\nwould still have that old certificate.\n\n308\n00:15:38.370 --> 00:15:46.170\nAll right Cherokee so that is\nthe Enterprise side, again, of EFS.\n\n309\n00:15:46.170 --> 00:15:49.720\nRight, it doesn't work any different\nas far as the end users go.\n\n310\n00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:52.610\nThey can right click on a file and\nchoose to encrypt it.\n\n311\n00:15:52.610 --> 00:15:56.570\nBut the enterprise-\n&gt;&gt; Just having that additional\n\n312\n00:15:56.570 --> 00:15:57.720\nrecovery option.\n\n313\n00:15:57.720 --> 00:15:59.612\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it definitely has that.\n\n314\n00:15:59.612 --> 00:16:03.270\nNow let's talk about a couple\nmore things as we round this up.\n\n315\n00:16:03.270 --> 00:16:04.884\nOne, how do I back that up?\n\n316\n00:16:04.884 --> 00:16:07.055\nLet's say we were in\na workgroup environment.\n\n317\n00:16:07.055 --> 00:16:08.395\nI'm working in a small office.\n\n318\n00:16:08.395 --> 00:16:09.859\nWe don't have a domain.\n\n319\n00:16:09.859 --> 00:16:13.840\nI want my users to be able to\nencrypt stuff, but now I'm scared.\n\n320\n00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:15.326\nBecause I don't know if\nthey're backing that up.\n\n321\n00:16:15.326 --> 00:16:16.259\nHow do I teach them?\n\n322\n00:16:16.259 --> 00:16:18.091\nHow do they go about backing up that key.\n\n323\n00:16:18.091 --> 00:16:20.054\nWell, you saw that little\nbubble that popped up.\n\n324\n00:16:20.054 --> 00:16:24.323\nWindows is now, nice, and\nit warns me and it gives me that access.\n\n325\n00:16:24.323 --> 00:16:29.736\nCuz I can click on this and\nit should, let's see here.\n\n326\n00:16:29.736 --> 00:16:33.217\nMaybe, maybe it just warns you,\nit doesn't let you do anything.\n\n327\n00:16:33.217 --> 00:16:34.345\nYeah, it doesn't seem to.\n\n328\n00:16:34.345 --> 00:16:35.928\nWe'll see if it pops up in a minute.\n\n329\n00:16:35.928 --> 00:16:36.982\nBut at least they warned me.\n\n330\n00:16:36.982 --> 00:16:40.077\nThat's something that older\nversions of the OS didn't do.\n\n331\n00:16:40.077 --> 00:16:44.822\nWhat they need to do to back up their\ncertificate, is they need to export it.\n\n332\n00:16:44.822 --> 00:16:46.990\nSo if you create a console.\n\n333\n00:16:46.990 --> 00:16:49.529\nAnd you add your certificates snap in.\n\n334\n00:16:49.529 --> 00:16:51.495\nI know we covered this in other classes.\n\n335\n00:16:51.495 --> 00:16:56.493\nI don't know if I need to\nshow you all that again.\n\n336\n00:16:56.493 --> 00:16:59.073\nI see two windows open,\nmaybe, look at there.\n\n337\n00:16:59.073 --> 00:17:01.792\nSo, when I clicked on that message,\n\n338\n00:17:01.792 --> 00:17:05.670\nit did indeed pop open\nthe my certificates console.\n\n339\n00:17:05.670 --> 00:17:09.230\nOr no, actually I think I just\ndouble-clicked on it twice.\n\n340\n00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:13.081\nThank you Windows, for at least\nwarning me, that I need to back it up.\n\n341\n00:17:13.081 --> 00:17:16.268\nSo anyway, if you don't know how to create\none of these, check out our other shows.\n\n342\n00:17:16.268 --> 00:17:18.631\nI'll do it really quick, but\nI'm not going to spend a lot of time.\n\n343\n00:17:18.631 --> 00:17:19.784\nGo to your Start Menu.\n\n344\n00:17:19.784 --> 00:17:24.665\nType in MMC, Microsoft Management Console.\n\n345\n00:17:24.665 --> 00:17:28.421\nWhich creates a blank tool\nwith nothing inside it, right?\n\n346\n00:17:28.421 --> 00:17:33.390\nAnd then, you gonna go file,\nadd-remove snap-in,\n\n347\n00:17:33.390 --> 00:17:37.826\nfind your certificates snap-in and\nclick add.\n\n348\n00:17:37.826 --> 00:17:40.454\nYou wanna select your user account\ncuz that's the certificate you want\n\n349\n00:17:40.454 --> 00:17:40.989\nto work with.\n\n350\n00:17:40.989 --> 00:17:45.022\nClick finish, and then click okay.\n\n351\n00:17:45.022 --> 00:17:47.847\nAnd that's gonna make\nthis console right here.\n\n352\n00:17:47.847 --> 00:17:50.386\nNow, I'm gonna close this and\nnot save my changes,\n\n353\n00:17:50.386 --> 00:17:53.284\ncuz I already made that console\nbefore we started the show.\n\n354\n00:17:53.284 --> 00:17:56.430\nThat's what this guy is right over here,\nright?\n\n355\n00:17:56.430 --> 00:17:58.011\nOnce you've got this console made,\n\n356\n00:17:58.011 --> 00:18:00.263\nunderneath Personal,\nyou click on certificates.\n\n357\n00:18:00.263 --> 00:18:04.110\nAnd there's my certificate that Joe\nwas using to encrypt his files.\n\n358\n00:18:04.110 --> 00:18:06.947\nJoe wants to make sure he has\na copy of this just in case,\n\n359\n00:18:06.947 --> 00:18:09.181\nhe has to reinstall his operating system.\n\n360\n00:18:09.181 --> 00:18:15.764\nProfile becomes, corrupt, whatever,\nright click, all tasks, export.\n\n361\n00:18:15.764 --> 00:18:18.026\nIt's gonna launch a wizard,\nvery, very simple.\n\n362\n00:18:18.026 --> 00:18:22.277\nWe'll click next, and yes,\nI wanna export the private key.\n\n363\n00:18:22.277 --> 00:18:25.871\nMake sure you answer\nthis question correctly.\n\n364\n00:18:25.871 --> 00:18:29.362\nI can say that [LAUGH], so,\nlike talking like Elmer Fudd here.\n\n365\n00:18:29.362 --> 00:18:33.742\nThe whole purpose, like, remember as\nAlice was sending something to Bob.\n\n366\n00:18:33.742 --> 00:18:37.428\nAnd so she said, hey, send me your\ncertificate so that I can encrypt this.\n\n367\n00:18:37.428 --> 00:18:37.993\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n368\n00:18:37.993 --> 00:18:42.562\n&gt;&gt; Well, if I choose no, all I'm\ndoing is exporting the certificate.\n\n369\n00:18:42.562 --> 00:18:46.449\nSo, if I wanted to send my certificate\nto Cherokee, this is what I would do.\n\n370\n00:18:46.449 --> 00:18:49.791\nBut if I'm trying to back up my private\nkey, then I definitely wanna say, yes.\n\n371\n00:18:49.791 --> 00:18:50.415\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] [LAUGH] [INAUDIBLE].\n\n372\n00:18:50.415 --> 00:18:51.919\n&gt;&gt; Export the private key, right?\n\n373\n00:18:51.919 --> 00:18:53.255\nOtherwise it's not doing much good.\n\n374\n00:18:53.255 --> 00:18:53.959\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n375\n00:18:53.959 --> 00:18:57.299\n&gt;&gt; So definitely, I wanna export\nthe private key, we'll click Next.\n\n376\n00:18:57.299 --> 00:19:01.187\nIt doesn't really matter if you\ndon't have a lot of choices here.\n\n377\n00:19:01.187 --> 00:19:06.235\nThere is an option, Delete the private\nkey if the export is successful.\n\n378\n00:19:06.235 --> 00:19:08.944\nSo, if you aren't gonna\nuse this machine anymore,\n\n379\n00:19:08.944 --> 00:19:12.649\nmaybe you wanna export your key just\nto make sure you have a backup of it.\n\n380\n00:19:12.649 --> 00:19:15.222\nBut then,\ndelete the one that's on the machine, so\n\n381\n00:19:15.222 --> 00:19:17.106\nthat nobody else can try to access it.\n\n382\n00:19:17.106 --> 00:19:18.881\nI plan on continuing to use this machine.\n\n383\n00:19:18.881 --> 00:19:23.986\nI'm just trying to back up my key, so I'm\ngonna leave the defaults, I'll click next.\n\n384\n00:19:23.986 --> 00:19:26.004\nAnd then,\nI'm going to password protect it.\n\n385\n00:19:26.004 --> 00:19:28.434\nNotice, I don't have a choice, right?\n\n386\n00:19:28.434 --> 00:19:30.033\nThe next button is grayed out.\n\n387\n00:19:30.033 --> 00:19:30.602\n&gt;&gt; Mm [LAUGH].\n\n388\n00:19:30.602 --> 00:19:34.066\n&gt;&gt; I'm not gonna go any further\nuntil I choose one of these.\n\n389\n00:19:34.066 --> 00:19:39.231\nI can't use this one, group or\nuser name, because I'm not set up for\n\n390\n00:19:39.231 --> 00:19:43.525\nthat in my domain environment,\nbut I can set a password.\n\n391\n00:19:43.525 --> 00:19:45.877\nThe reason it's asking me for\nthis, is because,\n\n392\n00:19:45.877 --> 00:19:47.623\nmy private key is part of the export.\n\n393\n00:19:47.623 --> 00:19:51.423\nIf I was just doing the public key,\nit wouldn't prompt me for a password,\n\n394\n00:19:51.423 --> 00:19:52.235\nnobody cares.\n\n395\n00:19:52.235 --> 00:19:54.185\nEverybody, I want everybody\nto have my public key.\n\n396\n00:19:54.185 --> 00:19:56.708\nThat's the whole point,\nthat's why we call it public.\n\n397\n00:19:56.708 --> 00:20:00.589\nPrivate key has to stay private,\nI'll click next.\n\n398\n00:20:00.589 --> 00:20:05.242\nI'll dump this out on my desktop,\njust so we can find it.\n\n399\n00:20:05.242 --> 00:20:09.411\nMy backup key.\n\n400\n00:20:11.356 --> 00:20:14.115\nNext and Finish.\n\n401\n00:20:14.115 --> 00:20:19.490\nAnd the export was successful, and I click\nOK, and I'm going to close this console.\n\n402\n00:20:19.490 --> 00:20:20.960\nNow, there's my back up.\n\n403\n00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:24.580\nNow obviously, my backup doesn't do me\nany good sitting here on my desktop.\n\n404\n00:20:24.580 --> 00:20:26.915\nCuz if I lose my hard drive,\nit would still be gone.\n\n405\n00:20:26.915 --> 00:20:27.515\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n406\n00:20:27.515 --> 00:20:30.300\n&gt;&gt; So, I would wanna put this on\nthumb drive somewhere, and then,\n\n407\n00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:31.758\nkeep that thumb drive very safe.\n\n408\n00:20:31.758 --> 00:20:32.402\n&gt;&gt; Under lock and key.\n\n409\n00:20:32.402 --> 00:20:37.254\n&gt;&gt; As Cherokee would say, label it,\nmaybe lock it up, put it in a safe.\n\n410\n00:20:37.254 --> 00:20:39.838\nJust make sure you can find it,\nbecause I've done this.\n\n411\n00:20:39.838 --> 00:20:45.591\nI have played around with EFS at home,\nput my key on a thumb drive.\n\n412\n00:20:45.591 --> 00:20:48.276\nSix months, eight months later,\nI'm looking for that thumb drive.\n\n413\n00:20:48.276 --> 00:20:49.932\nIt's been overwritten several times.\n\n414\n00:20:49.932 --> 00:20:53.867\nThe key is gone, and\nI lost access to all my encrypted data.\n\n415\n00:20:53.867 --> 00:20:55.923\nSo, learn from my mistakes, all right?\n\n416\n00:20:55.923 --> 00:20:59.678\n[LAUGH] So definitely would want to\nend up putting this on a thumb drive.\n\n417\n00:20:59.678 --> 00:21:04.483\nNow, if I had lost my certificate,\nin fact, let's do this.\n\n418\n00:21:04.483 --> 00:21:08.832\nLet's go back in here,\nand delete a certificate.\n\n419\n00:21:10.725 --> 00:21:15.810\nAnd now it's gone, no,\nwhatever am I going to do?\n\n420\n00:21:15.810 --> 00:21:17.272\nLet's see if I could open the document.\n\n421\n00:21:17.272 --> 00:21:21.398\nI know that might be cache right now,\nif I have it logged off.\n\n422\n00:21:21.398 --> 00:21:25.598\nLet's see what he says, yeah, so\nI do still have the key right now.\n\n423\n00:21:25.598 --> 00:21:31.077\nBut if I delete the certificate,\nlogged off, I'd end up losing access.\n\n424\n00:21:31.077 --> 00:21:34.285\nSo, let's say that it did happen or\nlet's say you move to new machine,\n\n425\n00:21:34.285 --> 00:21:35.957\nthey had to replace your hard drive.\n\n426\n00:21:35.957 --> 00:21:38.702\nAnd you had all these encrypted\nfiles up here in a share.\n\n427\n00:21:38.702 --> 00:21:42.623\nBut they've had to replace my hard drive,\nI don't have my private key anymore.\n\n428\n00:21:42.623 --> 00:21:44.353\nLucky for us we've got a backup.\n\n429\n00:21:44.353 --> 00:21:46.115\nI'm simply gonna double click on it.\n\n430\n00:21:46.115 --> 00:21:48.920\nAnd look,\nit brings me right to the import wizard.\n\n431\n00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:53.590\nI'm gonna import for my current user,\nthat's me, I'll click Next.\n\n432\n00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:56.681\nI found the file name,\nthat's fine, I'll click Next.\n\n433\n00:21:56.681 --> 00:22:02.930\nI'll enter the super secret password\nI used, and I'll click Next.\n\n434\n00:22:02.930 --> 00:22:06.385\nAnd I'll put it in the appropriate store,\nI'll let it pick, that's fine,\n\n435\n00:22:06.385 --> 00:22:07.889\nwe'll click Next, and Finish.\n\n436\n00:22:07.889 --> 00:22:10.044\nAnd the import was successful.\n\n437\n00:22:10.044 --> 00:22:14.984\nAnd now, if I go take a look,\nhopefully, there it is.\n\n438\n00:22:14.984 --> 00:22:18.264\nMy certificate is back, so,\nit's so easy to export.\n\n439\n00:22:18.264 --> 00:22:20.254\nIt's just that most people\ndon't know to do that, right?\n\n440\n00:22:20.254 --> 00:22:22.818\nAnd it's nice now that Windows\nat least prompts you for that.\n\n441\n00:22:22.818 --> 00:22:23.362\n&gt;&gt; Reminds you.\n\n442\n00:22:23.362 --> 00:22:24.409\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n443\n00:22:24.409 --> 00:22:27.088\n&gt;&gt; Yes, but it's something that we've\ngotta work with and teach our users.\n\n444\n00:22:27.088 --> 00:22:30.936\nIf you're managing a small shop,\nwhere there isn't a domain controller.\n\n445\n00:22:30.936 --> 00:22:33.471\nAnd a built in recovery agent,\nthis is what you've gotta show them.\n\n446\n00:22:33.471 --> 00:22:37.601\nGotta teach them how to back up that key\nor you've gotta back it up for them,\n\n447\n00:22:37.601 --> 00:22:38.266\nall right?\n\n448\n00:22:38.266 --> 00:22:41.683\nIn a domain environment,\nif I had lost my certificate,\n\n449\n00:22:41.683 --> 00:22:44.607\nthen I would simply\ncontact my administrator.\n\n450\n00:22:44.607 --> 00:22:47.427\nAnd go through whatever\nprocess was necessary.\n\n451\n00:22:47.427 --> 00:22:48.868\nBut they would get the recovery agent.\n\n452\n00:22:48.868 --> 00:22:53.532\nSomebody would log on as the recovery\nagent, and they would decrypt my files for\n\n453\n00:22:53.532 --> 00:22:54.306\nme, right?\n\n454\n00:22:54.306 --> 00:22:57.413\nThen I would get a new key\npair issued to me, and\n\n455\n00:22:57.413 --> 00:22:59.896\nI would encrypt them all over again.\n\n456\n00:22:59.896 --> 00:23:02.769\nSo, that's the way it would\nwork in a domain environment.\n\n457\n00:23:02.769 --> 00:23:05.666\nAnd that's your key,\nI think, wraps up EFS.\n\n458\n00:23:05.666 --> 00:23:09.494\nWe've taken at look at how it works,\nwhat it's made up of,\n\n459\n00:23:09.494 --> 00:23:11.575\nand how to keep ourselves safe.\n\n460\n00:23:11.575 --> 00:23:14.657\nIf it's in a work group environment,\nbacking up our keys,\n\n461\n00:23:14.657 --> 00:23:16.332\nsent it to domain environment.\n\n462\n00:23:16.332 --> 00:23:19.653\nMaking sure we understand who\nthat recovery agent is, and\n\n463\n00:23:19.653 --> 00:23:21.294\nhow they can recover files.\n\n464\n00:23:21.294 --> 00:23:22.369\n&gt;&gt; Well thank you Mike for\n\n465\n00:23:22.369 --> 00:23:25.833\nthat in-depth explanation to make\nsure that we really understand EFS.\n\n466\n00:23:25.833 --> 00:23:30.197\nI appreciate that, I also appreciate you\nbeing with us, but for now let's sign out.\n\n467\n00:23:30.197 --> 00:23:31.561\nI've been your host, Cherokee Booze.\n\n468\n00:23:31.561 --> 00:23:32.318\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n469\n00:23:32.318 --> 00:23:35.376\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here, on ITPROV TV.\n\n470\n00:23:35.376 -->

watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n3\n00:00:10.378 --> 00:00:15.251\n&gt;&gt; Welcome everyone to your configure\nWindows devices series, studying for\n\n4\n00:00:15.251 --> 00:00:16.960\nthat 70-697 exam.\n\n5\n00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.370\nI'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:21.240\nThis is actually a part three,\n\n7\n00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.580\nwhere we will continue to take a look at\nconfiguring our file and folder access.\n\n8\n00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.500\nAnd with us today back in studios,\nwe have Mike Rodrick.\n\n9\n00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:30.650\nHow's it going today Mike?\n\n10\n00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:32.120\n&gt;&gt; It's going fantastic, Cherokee.\n\n11\n00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.790\nGlad to be back.\n\n12\n00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.125\nExcited as always and yeah, part three,\nman I do like like mini series, don't I?\n\n13\n00:00:37.125 --> 00:00:38.565\nWe have a lot to talk about.\n\n14\n00:00:38.565 --> 00:00:41.425\nWe do.\nWe're gonna be talking about permissions.\n\n15\n00:00:41.425 --> 00:00:43.598\nIn the previous parts,\nI think we looked at shares and\n\n16\n00:00:43.598 --> 00:00:46.363\nsetting up different ways to access\nresources across the network.\n\n17\n00:00:46.363 --> 00:00:48.186\nToday we're gonna take a look at-- or\n\n18\n00:00:48.186 --> 00:00:51.185\nin this episode we're going to\ntake a look at NTFS permissions.\n\n19\n00:00:51.185 --> 00:00:57.555\nThe way we secure access to our\nresources on our NTFS partitions.\n\n20\n00:00:57.555 --> 00:01:00.530\nAnd really what it comes down to--\nthis is a major part of our job.\n\n21\n00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.248\nWhen we talk about security,\nwe talk about the CIA triad,\n\n22\n00:01:05.248 --> 00:01:09.750\nconfidentiality, integrity and\navailability.\n\n23\n00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.238\nAnd when we think about security and\navailability,\n\n24\n00:01:12.238 --> 00:01:15.923\nit is making sure the resource are\navailable but there's a little more to it.\n\n25\n00:01:15.923 --> 00:01:19.205\nMaking sure the resources are available\nto those that are authorized.\n\n26\n00:01:19.205 --> 00:01:22.470\nIt's really easy to make\nthem available to everybody,\n\n27\n00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.905\nwhich is typically not what we want to do.\n\n28\n00:01:24.905 --> 00:01:29.115\nWe were just joking around in the chatroom\nabout things like making everybody admin,\n\n29\n00:01:29.115 --> 00:01:30.405\nit's be the same thing.\n\n30\n00:01:30.405 --> 00:01:34.840\nJust giving everybody full control\nover a resource, yeah, my job is done.\n\n31\n00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:35.420\nNo it's not.\n\n32\n00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.840\nYou got to make sure that this\nteam has read access to it.\n\n33\n00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.130\nBut this team has read write to it.\n\n34\n00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.250\nAnd these mmangers have full control.\n\n35\n00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:48.230\nControlling that level of access or\nthat availability, is what we want to do.\n\n36\n00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:50.750\nSo we're talking about security and\navailability,\n\n37\n00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.640\nto making sure that we give\nthe availability in a secure fashion.\n\n38\n00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:56.930\nAnyway, enough of that.\n\n39\n00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.470\nTake a look at our track,\nwe'll go into more detail there.\n\n40\n00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.872\nHere, let's just focus on what we\nneed to know for the exam, and\n\n41\n00:02:03.872 --> 00:02:05.971\nthat is dealing with NTFS permission.\n\n42\n00:02:05.971 --> 00:02:08.700\nSo, the first thing I wanna talk\nabout is just square away some terms.\n\n43\n00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.099\nMake sure we're all on the same page,\nbecause these are probably things, that if\n\n44\n00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:17.500\nyou've done this before you're familiar\nwith it, you understand but on the exam\n\n45\n00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.880\nthey might use terms you don't use in\nyour every day dealings with permissions.\n\n46\n00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.362\nSo let's start there.\n\n47\n00:02:23.362 --> 00:02:28.394\nWe're looking at my screen, I'm on my\nWindows 10 box, and I'm going to right\n\n48\n00:02:28.394 --> 00:02:33.796\nclick on this folder called Project data,\nand I'm going to choose Properties Right,\n\n49\n00:02:33.796 --> 00:02:39.100\nand on this properties page let me just\nzoom in here there is a security tab.\n\n50\n00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.680\nThat we call it the security tab,\nthis is where we add or remove people,\n\n51\n00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.400\nwe add entries control levels\nof access to a resource.\n\n52\n00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.470\nThis is what's known as\nthe discretionary access control list.\n\n53\n00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:57.100\nDACL or DACL for short.\n\n54\n00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.240\n&gt;&gt; Not to be confused with cankle.\n\n55\n00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:01.710\nThat's something totally different.\n\n56\n00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:04.465\n&gt;&gt; That is completely different and\nprobably not part of this show.\n\n57\n00:03:04.465 --> 00:03:07.360\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But this is a DACL or\n\n58\n00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.290\na discretionary access control list.\n\n59\n00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:14.210\nSo when you go out there and you read, and\nyou look at command line tools like icacls\n\n60\n00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:17.930\nor using PowerShell to modify the DACL,\nwhat the heck are they talking about?\n\n61\n00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:18.440\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n62\n00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:19.320\n&gt;&gt; This is it right here.\n\n63\n00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:23.250\nWe're used to going in the GUI,\nand clicking Edit, and adding.\n\n64\n00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.060\nBut what this GUI is showing me,\n\n65\n00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:30.160\nthis is the graphical user interface for\nthe discretionary access control list.\n\n66\n00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:34.650\nEach one of these lines SYSTEM,\nMike Rodrick,\n\n67\n00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:39.260\nAdministrator, these are known as\nan ACE or an access control entry.\n\n68\n00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.700\nAnd this is how you provide\naccess to a resource.\n\n69\n00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:45.410\nYou go to the DACL, and\nyou create a new ACE for somebody or\n\n70\n00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:49.040\na group of somebodies that\nneeds access to the resource.\n\n71\n00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.880\nKeep in mind it doesn't have to be a user,\nit could be a computer.\n\n72\n00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.390\nThose are also security identifiers.\n\n73\n00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:55.720\nWe can add those.\n\n74\n00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:56.860\nComputers can be in groups.\n\n75\n00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:59.310\nWe can add them as well.\n\n76\n00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:00.070\nAlright.\n\n77\n00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:05.990\nSo DACL, discretionary access control\nlist, ACE access control entry,\n\n78\n00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:11.820\nyou can also call this an ACL, an access\ncontrol list without the D on there.\n\n79\n00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:15.950\nTechnically, with Windows,\nwe use discretionary acts as control list,\n\n80\n00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:19.240\nbecause it's at the discretion\nof the creator owner.\n\n81\n00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:22.270\nIf you create a folder,\nyou right click in Windows Explorer.\n\n82\n00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:28.040\nNew folder, or new file, or you go into\nExcel or Word and you create a document.\n\n83\n00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:30.770\nAnd you save it on the hard drive,\nwell you're the creator or\n\n84\n00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:33.410\nowner of that document resource.\n\n85\n00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:37.980\nAnd you actually have full control over\nthat resource, full control allows you to\n\n86\n00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:41.930\nmodify or choose, who does or\ndoesn't have access to the resource.\n\n87\n00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:47.050\nYou can modify the access control list,\nwhich means it's at your discretion,\n\n88\n00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:48.080\nhence the name.\n\n89\n00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:53.070\nDiscretionary access control versus, where\nit's at somebody's discretion versus, say,\n\n90\n00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:56.300\nmandatory access control\nwhere it's predefined\n\n91\n00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:01.570\nwhere if you were belong to this rule and\nyou have access to this resource.\n\n92\n00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:08.320\nSo just a couple terms again,\nACL, DACL and ACE.\n\n93\n00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:13.320\nWe'll also talk about something known as a\nsystem access control list at some point,\n\n94\n00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:14.120\nor SACL.\n\n95\n00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:17.230\nIt's another list\nassociated with a resource.\n\n96\n00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:20.740\nThis is how we control auditing for\na particular resource.\n\n97\n00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:23.200\nWe'll take a look at that eventually.\n\n98\n00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:28.750\nSo now we know what this is, let's talk\nabout the permissions that we have\n\n99\n00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:31.600\navailable when we look at\nthis access control list.\n\n100\n00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:35.800\nYou'll see these are known\nas my standard permissions.\n\n101\n00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:41.030\nFull control, Modify, Read &amp; execute,\nList folder contents, Read and Write.\n\n102\n00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:44.500\nAnd they're pretty self explanatory,\nexcept for maybe that right one and\n\n103\n00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:45.570\nthat modify one.\n\n104\n00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:48.120\nThe rest of them we can\nprobably figure out.\n\n105\n00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:51.880\nRead is gonna give me\nthe ability to read a document,\n\n106\n00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:56.785\nor if it's a folder I can list\nfolder contents as we see here.\n\n107\n00:05:56.785 --> 00:05:59.775\nThat permission wouldn't\nbe available on a file,\n\n108\n00:05:59.775 --> 00:06:02.115\nbecause you wouldn't\nhave a folder content.\n\n109\n00:06:02.115 --> 00:06:07.680\nBut read allows you to open a document, or\nread the contents of a current document.\n\n110\n00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:14.543\nWrite, is gonna let you create\nnew documents within that folder.\n\n111\n00:06:14.543 --> 00:06:16.840\nIf it's write permissions over a file,\n\n112\n00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:20.100\nthen you would be able\nto change that thought.\n\n113\n00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:21.356\nYou'd be able to write to that.\n\n114\n00:06:21.356 --> 00:06:24.080\nAnd I'm being very careful\nwith the words I choose.\n\n115\n00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:27.140\nI'm trying not to use the word, modify.\n\n116\n00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:29.250\nBecause that's a separate permission.\n\n117\n00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:35.960\nSo write allows me to create new documents\ninside a folder, or write to a file.\n\n118\n00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:41.220\nList folder contents, again in file\nexplorer or file from the command line,\n\n119\n00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:45.330\nI can do a DIR and\nI can list the contents of that folder.\n\n120\n00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:49.550\nRead and Execute,\nis read plus the ability to execute.\n\n121\n00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:55.390\nSo if it's a .cmd, a .bat, a .exe,\nsomething that needs to be executed or\n\n122\n00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:58.430\nrun, I would need the read and\nexecute permissions.\n\n123\n00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:02.650\nIf I have read permission but not read and\nexecute, I can't double click on a .exe\n\n124\n00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:06.090\nand expect it to actually do\nwhat it's supposed to do.\n\n125\n00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:13.040\nModify permission is the ability to delete\nobjects, that's really what it's adding.\n\n126\n00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:16.280\nAnd we'll talk about how these\nbuild in just a second, but\n\n127\n00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:21.390\nmodify gives you the ability to\ndelete files out of a folder.\n\n128\n00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:24.140\nFull control,\n\n129\n00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:28.630\nactually gives you the ability to\nchange the access control lists.\n\n130\n00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:32.680\nModify the permissions,\nthe owner of a document.\n\n131\n00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:36.330\nNow let's talk about the ways these build.\n\n132\n00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:40.580\nAll I did was I clicked,\nI can't make any changes here.\n\n133\n00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:43.720\nTo change permissions,\nyou're gonna click Edit, so I click edit.\n\n134\n00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:49.800\nAnd that opens up the access control\nlist again, but now in an editable view.\n\n135\n00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:54.118\nAnd I'm gonna add a new entry just so\nwe can have something to play with.\n\n136\n00:07:54.118 --> 00:08:00.095\nI'm gonna add the, I think I've got a\ngroup for the directors, I believe, yeah.\n\n137\n00:08:00.095 --> 00:08:03.399\nSo I've got a directors group\nhere that I'm gonna add.\n\n138\n00:08:03.399 --> 00:08:08.470\nAnd I can see or down below I have two\ncolumns and some check marks, all right?\n\n139\n00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:13.040\nI've got Allow, Deny and then my\ncheck marks next to my permissions.\n\n140\n00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:16.830\nAnd I'm gonna uncheck everything because\none of the things that we need to be\n\n141\n00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:20.420\nfamiliar with this how these permissions\nbuild on each other if they do.\n\n142\n00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:25.210\nAnd what I mean by that is notice when I\ncheck Read Nothing else gets selected.\n\n143\n00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:29.930\nSo I can give you repermission on\nits own and nothing more, all right.\n\n144\n00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:33.090\nThe one that always throws those people,\nCherokee, is this one.\n\n145\n00:08:33.090 --> 00:08:36.640\nI can give you right permission and\nright does not build on anything.\n\n146\n00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:41.210\nYou might assume, yeah, but\nit's Cherokee there because how\n\n147\n00:08:41.210 --> 00:08:44.140\nare you gonna write something if\nyou can't in fact read it, right?\n\n148\n00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:46.860\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, you might think, well wait,\nwhat good is that gonna do to me?\n\n149\n00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:49.850\nWhy would I give somebody write\npermissions and not give them read?\n\n150\n00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:51.870\nCuz at this point if\nit's a full directory,\n\n151\n00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:55.500\nI could create new documents but I\ncouldn't then open up those documents and\n\n152\n00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:57.360\nread those documents, all right.\n\n153\n00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:00.740\nAnd this is, it's honestly,\nI don't think I've ever used it\n\n154\n00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:05.120\nin the real world I can give you\na scenario where this might be useful.\n\n155\n00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:07.841\nThink about it, if I was an instructor.\n\n156\n00:09:07.841 --> 00:09:12.802\nStretch of the imagination there, and\nlet's say I gave you homework that\n\n157\n00:09:12.802 --> 00:09:17.522\nI wanted you to upload your results\nto this FTP server that I had set up.\n\n158\n00:09:17.522 --> 00:09:22.483\nI might give you right permissions over\na folder on that FTP server to allow\n\n159\n00:09:22.483 --> 00:09:25.710\nyou to upload your homework assignment.\n\n160\n00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:30.490\nWell, what I don't want is you opening up\nother people's documents and reading those\n\n161\n00:09:30.490 --> 00:09:34.830\nto see what they did for their homework\nand then cheating and copying it, right?\n\n162\n00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:37.770\nSo I give you write permissions but\nnot read permission.\n\n163\n00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:40.910\nWhen you wrote to that directory,\nbecause you have write permission,\n\n164\n00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:42.620\nyou'd be able to upload your content.\n\n165\n00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:44.950\nYou'd be the creator owner\nof that particular document.\n\n166\n00:09:44.950 --> 00:09:47.660\nSo you'd still be able to\nedit that one document but\n\n167\n00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:49.610\nyou couldn't read anybody else's homework,\nright?\n\n168\n00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:52.520\nAnybody else that uploaded something,\nyou wouldn't have read access.\n\n169\n00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:57.120\nSo, you can give somebody right,\nwithout giving them read.\n\n170\n00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:58.630\nIt's not all that common,\n\n171\n00:09:58.630 --> 00:10:03.510\nthis might be more used when we're dealing\nwith services and giving them access.\n\n172\n00:10:03.510 --> 00:10:06.650\nBut just understand that they\ndon't build on each other.\n\n173\n00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:10.020\nList folder contents doesn't\nbuild on anything else.\n\n174\n00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:13.360\nI can give you that without\ngiving you any other permissions.\n\n175\n00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:15.920\nRead and execute however does build.\n\n176\n00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:20.940\nNotice when I check read and execute, you\nalso get read and list folder contents.\n\n177\n00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:23.840\nAnd if I try to take one of\nthese other permissions away.\n\n178\n00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:26.220\nNotice read and execute goes away.\n\n179\n00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:28.130\nSo that permission does build.\n\n180\n00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:32.390\nIf I give you read and execute that\nis gonna automatically include\n\n181\n00:10:32.390 --> 00:10:35.220\nlist folder contents and read, okay?\n\n182\n00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:39.260\nI'm gonna uncheck those,\nand let's try modify.\n\n183\n00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:41.330\nAnd modify does build on everything.\n\n184\n00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:46.490\nIt basically gives you everything as far\nas read, write, list folder contents,\n\n185\n00:10:46.490 --> 00:10:47.900\nread and execute.\n\n186\n00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:50.490\nWhat it adds is the ability to delete.\n\n187\n00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:52.530\nThe wording is a little tricky\nbecause you might think, well,\n\n188\n00:10:52.530 --> 00:10:55.440\nwait, modify means I can modify a file.\n\n189\n00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:59.560\nI can go in and change a paragraph or\ndelete a sentence.\n\n190\n00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:01.890\nBut I can do that with write permission,\nright?\n\n191\n00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:05.290\nModify here is really talking\nabout the object itself and\n\n192\n00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:06.820\nI can delete that object.\n\n193\n00:11:08.130 --> 00:11:11.740\nIf I uncheck any of those other\npermissions, you lose Modify.\n\n194\n00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:15.520\nSo if you get Modify,\nyou get all of the other permissions.\n\n195\n00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:19.870\nAnd then the last one is full control and\nyou'll never guess.\n\n196\n00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:21.430\nYeah, you probably did.\n\n197\n00:11:21.430 --> 00:11:26.280\nFull control gives you everything, Modify,\nRead &amp; execute, List folder contents,\n\n198\n00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:27.510\nRead, and Write.\n\n199\n00:11:27.510 --> 00:11:30.920\nReally the only thing full\ncontrol gives you over Modify\n\n200\n00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:33.580\nis the ability to modify\nthe access controllers.\n\n201\n00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:34.590\n&gt;&gt; Okay, yeah.\n\n202\n00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:35.960\n&gt;&gt; It doesn't give you that much more.\n\n203\n00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:39.700\nIf you had Modify permissions over\na resource, you've got pretty much.\n\n204\n00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:44.160\nI don't want to say you have\nfull control cuz you don't.\n\n205\n00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:46.980\nBut you can do just about anything\nyou want other than modify\n\n206\n00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:48.500\nthe access control list.\n\n207\n00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:51.960\nOr take ownership, that's what full\ncontrol gives us is the ability to change\n\n208\n00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:55.790\npermissions, as well as the ability\nto take ownership of a document.\n\n209\n00:11:55.790 --> 00:12:00.750\n&gt;&gt; So these are the permissions that\nwe probably want to dole out on\n\n210\n00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:05.980\na limited basis because we don't want\neveryone being able to run an executable\n\n211\n00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:10.380\nfile especially if it's some kind of\n&gt;&gt; A time clock software where I can\n\n212\n00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:14.220\nfudge my hours or something silly like\nthat but yeah, from just the security\n\n213\n00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:18.030\nstand point that you were mentioning\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, these are what's known as\n\n214\n00:12:18.030 --> 00:12:23.350\nthe standard permissions and\n99 i'm just making this number up.\n\n215\n00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:29.076\nBut 99% of the time this is all your going\nto need I rarely have to go Beyond this.\n\n216\n00:12:29.076 --> 00:12:29.856\nBut we can.\n\n217\n00:12:29.856 --> 00:12:31.884\nIf I scroll down to the bottom,\n\n218\n00:12:31.884 --> 00:12:35.706\nyou'll notice that there's\nthis special permissions.\n\n219\n00:12:35.706 --> 00:12:40.854\nIt's nothing that I can check, but\nsometimes you will find that is selected.\n\n220\n00:12:40.854 --> 00:12:44.052\nLet me see if any of these guys are,\nthey are not.\n\n221\n00:12:44.052 --> 00:12:45.456\nBut we will fix that.\n\n222\n00:12:45.456 --> 00:12:49.122\n&gt;&gt; Didn't they change the name\nsomewhere along the line?\n\n223\n00:12:49.122 --> 00:12:54.220\nIt used to be basic and\nthen we had advanced, and then special.\n\n224\n00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:56.990\n&gt;&gt; They're well, I don't know,\nmaybe the way you talk about it,\n\n225\n00:12:56.990 --> 00:13:01.200\nbut the standard permissions and\nthen you have your special permissions.\n\n226\n00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:06.070\nAnd the special permissions are really\njust a little more granular, all right.\n\n227\n00:13:06.070 --> 00:13:07.050\nI'm going to go ahead and\n\n228\n00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:12.370\nlet's see what I ended up with directors\nI left them with full control.\n\n229\n00:13:12.370 --> 00:13:15.280\nI'll go ahead and\napply that, and click okay.\n\n230\n00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:19.560\nTo get in to my special permissions,\nand now if I look at directors,\n\n231\n00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:23.890\nright we gave them full control,\nso everything is selected, right?\n\n232\n00:13:23.890 --> 00:13:26.840\nModify, read and execute,\nlist, read and write.\n\n233\n00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:29.710\nTo work with special permissions,\nI'm gonna click Advanced.\n\n234\n00:13:29.710 --> 00:13:33.690\nIn fact, actually let me take\nthe Directors permissions away, so\n\n235\n00:13:33.690 --> 00:13:34.910\nthat we can go in there and play.\n\n236\n00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:40.440\nEh, I'll leave it trying to decide\nwhat the best way to show you this is.\n\n237\n00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:44.200\nTo get into the special permissions,\nwe're gonna use this Advanced button.\n\n238\n00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:47.520\nNow let me zoom out so you can kinda see\nwhere we're at, then I'll zoom back in.\n\n239\n00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:48.610\nSo you can see what we're doing,\n\n240\n00:13:48.610 --> 00:13:52.020\nI'm gonna cancel that out again,\nI'm on that security tab.\n\n241\n00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:55.800\nBut instead of clicking edit, edit lets\nme work with the standard permissions.\n\n242\n00:13:55.800 --> 00:14:00.040\nI'm gonna click advanced, and\nadvanced brings up this different window.\n\n243\n00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:02.770\nAnd what it does is it gives\nme the ability to work\n\n244\n00:14:02.770 --> 00:14:06.410\na little more granularly on one.\n\n245\n00:14:06.410 --> 00:14:08.075\n&gt;&gt; If I can say it that way.\n\n246\n00:14:08.075 --> 00:14:09.920\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Over these permissions, all right?\n\n247\n00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:12.730\nI'm gonna click add, or\nactually I'll select the directors and\n\n248\n00:14:12.730 --> 00:14:15.430\nI'll click edit rather than add a new one,\nall right?\n\n249\n00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:19.280\nAnd I can see director's full control\nbecause that's what we assigned using\n\n250\n00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:22.590\nthe standard permissions,\nbut when I click edit and\n\n251\n00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:27.000\nI come into this screen,\nit used to show them right here.\n\n252\n00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.620\nNow it shows you the basic permissions or\nstandard permissions.\n\n253\n00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:34.070\nAnd you have a link over here\nto show advanced permissions.\n\n254\n00:14:34.070 --> 00:14:35.680\nThey really tried to hide this from you.\n\n255\n00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:40.390\nI shouldn't say hide, they don't show\nit automatically cuz, like I said,\n\n256\n00:14:40.390 --> 00:14:43.730\nwe don't normally have to\ngo to this level of detail.\n\n257\n00:14:43.730 --> 00:14:46.300\nBut let me click it to show you where\nthey're at, because you might need to know\n\n258\n00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:50.780\nfor the exam and there are occasions\nwhen you might need to use these.\n\n259\n00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:54.760\nAll of these as I said earlier\nis a more glandular control.\n\n260\n00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:59.740\nWe'll see that if I zoom in here, you\nstill have full control well like read and\n\n261\n00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:03.140\ninstead of just read,\nlike we do standard permissions.\n\n262\n00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:08.310\nI have read attributes,\nread extended attributes read permissions,\n\n263\n00:15:08.310 --> 00:15:12.340\nso what was one permission is now three.\n\n264\n00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:15.730\nSo we can take read and I can break\nit up into three little chunks.\n\n265\n00:15:15.730 --> 00:15:18.250\nIf I give you read standard permission,\n\n266\n00:15:18.250 --> 00:15:23.010\nthat allows you to read attributes, read\nextended attributes and read permissions.\n\n267\n00:15:23.010 --> 00:15:28.160\nBut maybe for some reasons,\nI want you to read the data.\n\n268\n00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:29.350\nI'm sorry, I forgot read data.\n\n269\n00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:31.620\nList folder and\nlist data is part of that as well.\n\n270\n00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:36.190\nMaybe I want you to read the data, but\nI don't want you looking the attributes or\n\n271\n00:15:36.190 --> 00:15:38.410\nI don't want you looking\nat the permissions.\n\n272\n00:15:38.410 --> 00:15:41.160\nBut if I give you read,\nstandard permission,\n\n273\n00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:44.190\nyou're going to automatically read\nattributes and read permissions.\n\n274\n00:15:44.190 --> 00:15:46.864\nI can come in here and\nI can uncheck those.\n\n275\n00:15:46.864 --> 00:15:50.533\nYou can still read data but\nyou can't read attributes and\n\n276\n00:15:50.533 --> 00:15:53.057\nyou can't read extended attributes.\n\n277\n00:15:53.057 --> 00:15:55.014\nSame thing with write okay.\n\n278\n00:15:55.014 --> 00:15:58.997\nWrite is a single permission as\nfar as standard permissions go.\n\n279\n00:15:58.997 --> 00:16:03.063\nWrite data but it gets broken down\nin the advanced we can see write\n\n280\n00:16:03.063 --> 00:16:07.068\ndata Right attributes,\nright extended attributes, right?\n\n281\n00:16:07.068 --> 00:16:10.180\nSo again, just more granular control.\n\n282\n00:16:10.180 --> 00:16:13.540\nI'm gonna zoom back out and\nI'm gonna apply this change.\n\n283\n00:16:15.750 --> 00:16:20.310\nAnd I'll go ahead and click, OK,\ncuz I wanna show you now what we see.\n\n284\n00:16:20.310 --> 00:16:24.350\nI have director selected, so\nI've got the ACE selected for directors.\n\n285\n00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:28.400\nAnd notice now I've got a little check\nmark there for special permissions.\n\n286\n00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:33.050\nThat is my indicator that somebody has\ngone beyond the standard permissions and\n\n287\n00:16:33.050 --> 00:16:35.130\nmade some more glandular changes.\n\n288\n00:16:35.130 --> 00:16:36.510\nDoesn't tell me what they are.\n\n289\n00:16:36.510 --> 00:16:38.970\nIt can't show me here,\nthere's not enough room.\n\n290\n00:16:38.970 --> 00:16:43.310\nBut it's my indicator that I\nneed to go click advanced and\n\n291\n00:16:43.310 --> 00:16:48.300\nI need to zoom back out here, need to\nsee it just says special right there.\n\n292\n00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:50.860\nIn order to find out,\nI have to click Edit.\n\n293\n00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:53.870\nAnd then, Show Advanced, cuz again,\nyou can see that check mark for\n\n294\n00:16:53.870 --> 00:16:55.290\nspecial permissions.\n\n295\n00:16:55.290 --> 00:16:59.400\nI click Show Sdvanced and\nnow I can see whats going on.\n\n296\n00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:03.232\nLike I said, typically you're not going to\nneed to go into that level of detail when\n\n297\n00:17:03.232 --> 00:17:04.450\nassigning permissions.\n\n298\n00:17:04.450 --> 00:17:07.950\nBut it is important to understand\nthat we can if we need to.\n\n299\n00:17:09.570 --> 00:17:13.010\nAll right, so\nthose are the 6 basic permissions and\n\n300\n00:17:13.010 --> 00:17:17.670\nthe 14 summoned granular\npermissions that we have there.\n\n301\n00:17:17.670 --> 00:17:21.170\nAll right, let's see what else\nwe want to talk about next.\n\n302\n00:17:21.170 --> 00:17:26.500\nSo when we talk about NTFS permissions,\none of the cool things about\n\n303\n00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:29.730\nNTFS permissions is that they inherit,\nall right?\n\n304\n00:17:29.730 --> 00:17:32.829\nAnd what that means is when I\nassign permissions to a resource,\n\n305\n00:17:33.910 --> 00:17:38.930\nanything below that should pick\nup those permissions by default.\n\n306\n00:17:38.930 --> 00:17:40.780\nOtherwise if I have a folder and\n\n307\n00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:45.020\nI give the sales group read\npermissions over that folder,\n\n308\n00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:50.230\nthat read permission will inherit down all\nthe documents, any sub folders and any\n\n309\n00:17:50.230 --> 00:17:54.810\ndocuments inside those sub folders that\nread permission would inherit down to.\n\n310\n00:17:54.810 --> 00:17:57.880\nAnd that's a good thing, we like that,\nthat's the default behavior.\n\n311\n00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:01.690\nWe can change that if we need to,\nbut it makes it really easy for\n\n312\n00:18:01.690 --> 00:18:04.800\nwhen it comes to administering\naccess to resources.\n\n313\n00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:10.220\nCuz if I have 100 documents that I need to\ngive the sales group read permission over,\n\n314\n00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:14.530\nrather than have to pull up the properties\nof each one of those resources one at\n\n315\n00:18:14.530 --> 00:18:20.160\na time and add the sales group to it,\nI can go to the root folder.\n\n316\n00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:21.129\nThe top folder.\n\n317\n00:18:21.129 --> 00:18:21.940\n&gt;&gt; Do it one time.\n\n318\n00:18:21.940 --> 00:18:22.937\n&gt;&gt; Yes, one time.\n\n319\n00:18:22.937 --> 00:18:23.543\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n\n320\n00:18:23.543 --> 00:18:24.221\n&gt;&gt; And be done, right?\n\n321\n00:18:24.221 --> 00:18:25.535\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's a lot easier.\n\n322\n00:18:25.535 --> 00:18:27.249\n&gt;&gt; Yes, smarter, not harder, right?\n\n323\n00:18:27.249 --> 00:18:29.068\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly right.\n\n324\n00:18:29.068 --> 00:18:34.972\nAll right, and we also have to think, and\nI'll show you examples of this as we go,\n\n325\n00:18:34.972 --> 00:18:39.570\nabout best practices,\nas far as assigning permissions.\n\n326\n00:18:39.570 --> 00:18:43.260\nWhat Microsoft will tell you is we\nshould use groups to assign permissions.\n\n327\n00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:47.080\nWe don't like to assign\npermissions to individual users.\n\n328\n00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:50.420\nI know we talked more about this in the\nserver classes when we start talking about\n\n329\n00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:54.870\nActive Directory, and\nwe start talking about groups.\n\n330\n00:18:54.870 --> 00:18:59.660\nBut understand that a best practice is\nto assign permissions to groups rather\n\n331\n00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:00.480\nthan users.\n\n332\n00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:04.228\nAnd I bring that up now\nbecause it's important that we\n\n333\n00:19:04.228 --> 00:19:07.320\nunderstand the way NTFS permissions work.\n\n334\n00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:09.790\nI can assign permissions\ndirectly to a user.\n\n335\n00:19:09.790 --> 00:19:13.950\nIn other words, if I right-click on\nthis folder, and I go Properties, and\n\n336\n00:19:13.950 --> 00:19:18.240\nI go to that Security tab, you'll see\nmy account is actually listed there.\n\n337\n00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:25.210\nI can click Edit, and then Add and\nI can find Cherokees account for example.\n\n338\n00:19:25.210 --> 00:19:30.470\nSo I added a new ACE, for Cherokee,\nand now I can control her permissions.\n\n339\n00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:34.075\nMaybe I give her modified permissions,\nand I click OK.\n\n340\n00:19:34.075 --> 00:19:37.300\nAnd so I've just assigned\nthose permissions to Cherokee.\n\n341\n00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:40.240\nBut if I need to assign permissions to\n\n342\n00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:44.380\nmany people that's going to be a very\nineffective way of doing that.\n\n343\n00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:46.360\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\nMike I have a question for you.\n\n344\n00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:52.340\nIf I take the time and I maybe assign\nmaybe myself and you some permissions and\n\n345\n00:19:52.340 --> 00:19:56.690\nthen five months later I decide well\nwe start hiring more entertainers,\n\n346\n00:19:56.690 --> 00:19:59.000\nso let's just go ahead and\ncreate an edutainer's folder and\n\n347\n00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:02.197\nwe'll put everyone in there, And\nit assigns permissions to that folder.\n\n348\n00:20:02.197 --> 00:20:06.094\nHow does that work when it comes to any\nkind of conflicts that we may have between\n\n349\n00:20:06.094 --> 00:20:07.040\nthe permissions?\n\n350\n00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:09.582\n&gt;&gt; That's a great question and\nwe'll get you there.\n\n351\n00:20:09.582 --> 00:20:12.772\nHold that thought because we\ndefinitely want to deal with that.\n\n352\n00:20:12.772 --> 00:20:15.549\nBut as far as putting you know\nindividual users in here,\n\n353\n00:20:15.549 --> 00:20:20.720\nthe idea is that if I have 100 sales\npeople, I don't wanna have to add\n\n354\n00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:24.810\n100 people to this access control list,\none, it's gonna make this list very long.\n\n355\n00:20:24.810 --> 00:20:27.630\nSo when it comes to troubleshooting or\ntrying to figure out who has\n\n356\n00:20:27.630 --> 00:20:31.130\nwhat permissions, scrolling through or\nmaybe I need to make a change.\n\n357\n00:20:31.130 --> 00:20:33.510\nScrolling through this\nlist is gonna be crazy.\n\n358\n00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:35.920\nSo what I'd rather do is create a group.\n\n359\n00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:38.630\nThis was a security group\nwith an Active Directory.\n\n360\n00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:42.440\nIn that,\nI would put all the users in that group.\n\n361\n00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:46.830\nIn fact,\nwell ike I did with directors right here.\n\n362\n00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:49.850\nRather than add each one of\nthe directors individually,\n\n363\n00:20:49.850 --> 00:20:52.250\nI add a group to the access controllers.\n\n364\n00:20:52.250 --> 00:20:58.040\nIf you belong to a group, if your user\naccount is a member of a security group,\n\n365\n00:20:58.040 --> 00:21:01.000\nand that security group\nis assigned permissions,\n\n366\n00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:04.660\nthen you will automatically get\nthe permissions assigned to that group.\n\n367\n00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:06.760\nThat's the way NTFS is going to work.\n\n368\n00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:08.780\nAnd this is fantastic thing.\n\n369\n00:21:08.780 --> 00:21:10.390\nBecause if we hire,\nas Cherokee was saying,\n\n370\n00:21:10.390 --> 00:21:14.310\nI create a group called edutainers, and\nI put all of the current edutainers\n\n371\n00:21:14.310 --> 00:21:18.690\nuser accounts in that group,\nI can assign permissions using that group.\n\n372\n00:21:18.690 --> 00:21:21.710\nNow let's say we hire\nthree more edutainers.\n\n373\n00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:25.110\nI don't have to go back to every single\nresource that I've given permission to\n\n374\n00:21:25.110 --> 00:21:30.370\nthe edutainers over, I can simply\nadd those two new user accounts\n\n375\n00:21:30.370 --> 00:21:33.040\nto the group and\nthey'll automatically get the permissions.\n\n376\n00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:36.050\nI didn't have to modify\na single access control list.\n\n377\n00:21:36.050 --> 00:21:38.230\nAll I had to do is go\ninto Active Directory and\n\n378\n00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:41.020\nadd those two new users to that group.\n\n379\n00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:44.730\nLet's say one of\nthe edutainers leaves the row.\n\n380\n00:21:44.730 --> 00:21:47.473\nMaybe they decided they dont\nwanna be an edutainer anymore,\n\n381\n00:21:47.473 --> 00:21:50.445\nthey want to go into the other side\nof the camera and be a director.\n\n382\n00:21:50.445 --> 00:21:54.293\nWell, they no longer need the permissions\nthat were assigned to them over\n\n383\n00:21:54.293 --> 00:21:58.904\nthose resources as an If I used individual\nuser accounts, now I’m going back and\n\n384\n00:21:58.904 --> 00:22:00.553\nmanually undoing all that.\n\n385\n00:22:00.553 --> 00:22:04.950\nI’m finding all the places where\nthat was assigned permissions and\n\n386\n00:22:04.950 --> 00:22:07.422\nI’m having to remove those permissions.\n\n387\n00:22:07.422 --> 00:22:08.932\nIf I used groups instead,\n\n388\n00:22:08.932 --> 00:22:12.227\nall I have to do is pull that\nuser account out of the group.\n\n389\n00:22:12.227 --> 00:22:16.220\nBecause they got the permissions\nwhen I added them to the group.\n\n390\n00:22:16.220 --> 00:22:19.384\nAs soon as I pulled them out of the group\nthey no longer get the permission\n\n391\n00:22:19.384 --> 00:22:23.100\nwhich were assigned to that group, and\nall have permission over these resources.\n\n392\n00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:26.690\nIt's much, much easier and\nMicrosoft loves this on the exams, right?\n\n393\n00:22:26.690 --> 00:22:31.506\nThey talk about their favourite\nphrases with the least administrative\n\n394\n00:22:31.506 --> 00:22:35.930\neffort assigning permissions\nusing groups is definitely that.\n\n395\n00:22:35.930 --> 00:22:37.752\n&gt;&gt; And really, not just Microsoft but\n\n396\n00:22:37.752 --> 00:22:40.130\norganizations really\nlove this concept too.\n\n397\n00:22:40.130 --> 00:22:44.170\nBecause it really aligns with a lot\nof company structure already.\n\n398\n00:22:44.170 --> 00:22:46.930\nI mean, we do have departments\nwithin organization,\n\n399\n00:22:46.930 --> 00:22:48.860\nat least we do here at ITProTV.\n\n400\n00:22:48.860 --> 00:22:51.620\nSo it just kinda fits the mold when\nyou're talking about creating those\n\n401\n00:22:51.620 --> 00:22:52.900\ngroups in an easy.\n\n402\n00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:56.710\nBecause if you think about it,\nmost people in a department,\n\n403\n00:22:56.710 --> 00:22:59.670\nthey really do access\nsimilar shared resources.\n\n404\n00:22:59.670 --> 00:23:03.680\nSo it's just an easy way to go ahead and\norganize the departments.\n\n405\n00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:04.400\n&gt;&gt; It is, it is.\n\n406\n00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:09.880\nYou probably already have the appropriate\ngroups created as Cherokee was saying.\n\n407\n00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:14.000\nAll right, let's take a look,\ntest it out, let's try something here.\n\n408\n00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:17.234\nI'm gonna go and just,\nwe're gonna start over,\n\n409\n00:23:17.234 --> 00:23:21.860\nI'm gonna create a new folder and\nI'm gonna call this marketing data.\n\n410\n00:23:21.860 --> 00:23:26.990\nAll right, and in that folder,\nI'm gonna create a couple new documents.\n\n411\n00:23:28.620 --> 00:23:32.890\nI'm gonna be really creative and\ncall it File 01 or something like that.\n\n412\n00:23:34.050 --> 00:23:38.710\nAnd we'll make a couple of copies there,\njust so we have some things to play with.\n\n413\n00:23:38.710 --> 00:23:41.590\nI probably should name them appropriate,\n\n414\n00:23:41.590 --> 00:23:47.590\nwe'll say file 02 and\nfile 03, something like that.\n\n415\n00:23:47.590 --> 00:23:53.009\nWe'll also make a new\nfolder inside here and\n\n416\n00:23:53.009 --> 00:23:56.680\nI'm gonna call this Images.\n\n417\n00:23:56.680 --> 00:24:00.459\nIt may be inside here, we have a couple.\n\n418\n00:24:00.459 --> 00:24:01.855\nI'm gonna use text.\n\n419\n00:24:01.855 --> 00:24:05.182\nActually, I could do a bit of that image,\ncouldn't I?\n\n420\n00:24:05.182 --> 00:24:11.830\nYeah, we'll call it Image01, and\nwe'll make a couple of copies of that.\n\n421\n00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:17.854\nSince it is an images folder, I didn't\nwant to use a text document, so to say.\n\n422\n00:24:17.854 --> 00:24:19.083\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You have to be specific here,\nright?\n\n423\n00:24:19.083 --> 00:24:20.037\n&gt;&gt; Image02, that's right.\n\n424\n00:24:20.037 --> 00:24:20.791\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, technical.\n\n425\n00:24:20.791 --> 00:24:23.640\n&gt;&gt; Somebody will go,\nwhy his he making a folder now?\n\n426\n00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:25.510\nImage03, there we go.\n\n427\n00:24:25.510 --> 00:24:29.020\nSo now we've got some data to play with,\nwe've got this Marketing folder.\n\n428\n00:24:30.370 --> 00:24:32.478\nAnd let's assign some permissions.\n\n429\n00:24:32.478 --> 00:24:36.680\nI'm gonna right-click on Marketing,\nand I'm gonna choose Properties.\n\n430\n00:24:37.830 --> 00:24:40.630\nAnd then I'm gonna go to the Security tab,\nall right.\n\n431\n00:24:40.630 --> 00:24:45.570\nAnd this is, you notice I just\ncreated this folder, right?\n\n432\n00:24:45.570 --> 00:24:47.880\nAnd I already have entries in here.\n\n433\n00:24:49.270 --> 00:24:53.595\nThat's because this is\ninheriting from the root, right?\n\n434\n00:24:53.595 --> 00:24:55.640\nE: is what's above this.\n\n435\n00:24:55.640 --> 00:24:58.510\nIt's inheriting those permissions down.\n\n436\n00:24:58.510 --> 00:25:03.053\nIf we take a look at the properties of E,\n\n437\n00:25:03.053 --> 00:25:06.374\nthat drive itself, right?\n\n438\n00:25:06.374 --> 00:25:10.700\nEven the drive has a security tab,\nor this partition, I should say.\n\n439\n00:25:10.700 --> 00:25:14.195\nAnd here I can see these permissions,\nAuthenticated Users, SYSTEM,\n\n440\n00:25:14.195 --> 00:25:15.940\nAdministrators and Users.\n\n441\n00:25:15.940 --> 00:25:19.610\nAnd that's being inherited\ndown to that child,\n\n442\n00:25:19.610 --> 00:25:23.650\nin this case the child object is\nthe folder that we just created.\n\n443\n00:25:23.650 --> 00:25:28.340\nWhich brings me to another thing that\nwe probably need to discuss before.\n\n444\n00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:29.760\nWell, actually, let's take a look at it.\n\n445\n00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:30.590\nLet's go ahead and start.\n\n446\n00:25:30.590 --> 00:25:34.473\nI'm gonna go back in that E: drive,\nI'm gonna right-click on Marketing,\n\n447\n00:25:34.473 --> 00:25:36.276\nand I'm gonna choose Properties.\n\n448\n00:25:36.276 --> 00:25:38.841\nAlright, our marketing data,\nright-clicked on that folder.\n\n449\n00:25:38.841 --> 00:25:42.480\nI'm gonna click Edit, and\nthen I'm gonna click Add.\n\n450\n00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:47.872\nI wanna add a new ACE, an Access Control\nEntry, for the Marketing group, right?\n\n451\n00:25:47.872 --> 00:25:52.258\nSo I'll find the Marketing group,\nthen I'll click OK.\n\n452\n00:25:52.258 --> 00:25:57.978\nAnd I'm gonna give Marketing read and\nwrite permissions.\n\n453\n00:25:57.978 --> 00:26:04.020\nSo I check the appropriate permissions and\nI'm gonna click OK, and I'll click OK.\n\n454\n00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:07.189\nAnd now we go back and\ntake a look at those properties.\n\n455\n00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:12.970\nI'm gonna see that if I go to the security\ntab Marketing indeed has read and\n\n456\n00:26:12.970 --> 00:26:16.060\nwrite permission just like we assigned.\n\n457\n00:26:16.060 --> 00:26:18.690\nWhat about all the stuff\ninside Marketing though?\n\n458\n00:26:18.690 --> 00:26:21.334\nLet's take a look at one of\nthe files inside Marketing data.\n\n459\n00:26:21.334 --> 00:26:25.160\nI'll pull up those properties,\nI go to Security tab, I go to Marketing,\n\n460\n00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:29.330\nsure enough, they have read and\nwrite permissions over that file.\n\n461\n00:26:29.330 --> 00:26:31.220\nThat you saw me, we just created this.\n\n462\n00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:34.220\nI did not do that manually,\nthat's inheritance.\n\n463\n00:26:34.220 --> 00:26:35.720\nIt's inheriting down.\n\n464\n00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:36.845\nWhat about this folder?\n\n465\n00:26:36.845 --> 00:26:38.590\nDo permissions inherit to folders?\n\n466\n00:26:39.940 --> 00:26:44.250\nAbsolutely, Marketing has read and\nwrite over that folder.\n\n467\n00:26:44.250 --> 00:26:45.930\nAnd what about inside the images?\n\n468\n00:26:45.930 --> 00:26:47.260\nDid it come all the way down to here?\n\n469\n00:26:49.090 --> 00:26:52.010\nIt sure did, there is Marketing and\nthere is those permissions.\n\n470\n00:26:52.010 --> 00:26:53.883\nSo that's what inheritance is all about.\n\n471\n00:26:53.883 --> 00:26:58.900\nWhen you assign permissions at a\nparticular object, by default, it is going\n\n472\n00:26:58.900 --> 00:27:04.400\nto inherit down to any child objects,\nsub folders and files within there.\n\n473\n00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:06.580\nWe got more to do, Cherokee, but\nyou're giving me that signal,\n\n474\n00:27:06.580 --> 00:27:08.800\nlike we might be out of time.\n\n475\n00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:10.660\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nI think it was a great introduction, but\n\n476\n00:27:10.660 --> 00:27:14.870\nwe do have more to cover when it\ncomes to our file and folder access.\n\n477\n00:27:14.870 --> 00:27:17.530\nSo thank you Mike for taking the time,\nthank you for joining us, but\n\n478\n00:27:17.530 --> 00:27:18.650\nlet's sign out.\n\n479\n00:27:18.650 --> 00:27:20.000\nI've been your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n480\n00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:20.810\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n481\n00:27:20.810 --> 00:27:24.141\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n482\n00:27:24.141 --> 00:27:30.020\n[MUSIC]\n\n483\n00:27:30.020 --> 00:27:33.503\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

Francisco, California.\n\n3\n00:00:06.994 --> 00:00:11.849\n[CROSSTALK] [MUSIC] &gt;&gt;\nYou're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.080\n&gt;&gt; Welcome everyone to your\nconfiguring Windows devices series.\n\n5\n00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.427\nStudying up for that 70-697 exam.\n\n6\n00:00:17.427 --> 00:00:21.742\nI'm your host Cherokee Boose and\nwe've made it to part four where we will\n\n7\n00:00:21.742 --> 00:00:25.718\ncontinue taking a look at how to\nconfigure file and folder access.\n\n8\n00:00:25.718 --> 00:00:29.167\nAnd of course, with us today back\nin studio, we have Mr Mike Rodrick.\n\n9\n00:00:29.167 --> 00:00:30.120\nHow's it going?\n\n10\n00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:30.819\n&gt;&gt; It's going great.\n\n11\n00:00:30.819 --> 00:00:32.053\nThanks for having me back,\nexcited as always.\n\n12\n00:00:32.053 --> 00:00:33.166\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so permissions,\n\n13\n00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:36.189\nwe started taking a look at our NTF\npermissions in the last episode.\n\n14\n00:00:36.189 --> 00:00:38.516\nAnd you were showing us some\nways we could configure them.\n\n15\n00:00:38.516 --> 00:00:40.480\nWhat are we gonna be looking at here,\nMike?\n\n16\n00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.485\n&gt;&gt; Today I wanna take a look, we'll\njust kinda keep on trucking with that.\n\n17\n00:00:43.485 --> 00:00:46.876\nWe talked about what NTFS permissions\nwere, how we go about assigning them.\n\n18\n00:00:46.876 --> 00:00:48.946\nWe also talked a little bit about groups,\nand\n\n19\n00:00:48.946 --> 00:00:51.770\nhow we really want to assign\ninformations to groups.\n\n20\n00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.493\nAgain, covered much more thorough\nwhen we get into our server classes.\n\n21\n00:00:55.493 --> 00:00:59.784\nWe start thinking about\nstrategies like AGDLP or\n\n22\n00:00:59.784 --> 00:01:04.084\nAGUDLP, or actually, I'm sorry, IGDLA now.\n\n23\n00:01:04.084 --> 00:01:05.470\nThey've changed that on us.\n\n24\n00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:09.430\nBut anyway, what I'm talking about there\nis just the strategy we use to assign\n\n25\n00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:10.874\npermissions using groups.\n\n26\n00:01:10.874 --> 00:01:12.950\nWe'll deal with that more on\nthe server side of things.\n\n27\n00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.224\nBut I do wanna cover a few\nmore things when it comes to\n\n28\n00:01:16.224 --> 00:01:19.588\njust understanding the way\nNTFS permissions work.\n\n29\n00:01:19.588 --> 00:01:23.560\nWe started talking about inheritance and\nthat's we're gonna pick up.\n\n30\n00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.413\nSo let's just jump right back in,\ntake a look at my screen here.\n\n31\n00:01:26.413 --> 00:01:29.196\nAnd I'm gonna pull up that folder\nthat we were working with,\n\n32\n00:01:29.196 --> 00:01:32.050\nthe properties of that folder\nI should say, marketing data.\n\n33\n00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:36.512\nAnd if you remember we assigned\nthe marketing team, or\n\n34\n00:01:36.512 --> 00:01:40.780\ngroup I should say, we zoom in,\nwe gave them read and\n\n35\n00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.771\nwrite permissions over\nthat Marketing folder.\n\n36\n00:01:44.771 --> 00:01:47.250\nNow I'm gonna zoom out for just a second.\n\n37\n00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.165\nI'll move these properties over.\n\n38\n00:01:49.165 --> 00:01:56.380\nAnd I'm gonna go inside Marketing and pull\nup Properties for this subfolder, Images.\n\n39\n00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.087\nWe're gonna put these side-by-side,\nand we're gonna do a little pop quiz.\n\n40\n00:01:59.087 --> 00:02:01.050\nSo get ready, Cherokee.\n\n41\n00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.950\n&gt;&gt; Brother.\n[LAUGH]\n\n42\n00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:02.692\n&gt;&gt; Uh-oh, and\n\n43\n00:02:02.692 --> 00:02:07.400\nI'm gonna go to the permissions,\nso I've got Marketing, Marketing.\n\n44\n00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.664\nAnd we can see those\npermissions did inherit.\n\n45\n00:02:10.664 --> 00:02:12.265\nBut I want you to take a close look.\n\n46\n00:02:12.265 --> 00:02:13.357\nLet me see if I can zoom in there.\n\n47\n00:02:13.357 --> 00:02:15.349\nThat's a close look.\n\n48\n00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:19.529\nIs there any difference between the window\non the left and the window on the right?\n\n49\n00:02:19.529 --> 00:02:20.570\n&gt;&gt; Slight.\n\n50\n00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:21.188\n&gt;&gt; Slight, what is it?\n\n51\n00:02:21.188 --> 00:02:23.280\n&gt;&gt; Just a few hues.\n\n52\n00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.619\n&gt;&gt; It is a few hues off, isn't it?\n\n53\n00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:26.504\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's a good way of putting it.\n\n54\n00:02:26.504 --> 00:02:30.649\nYou notice that the permissions on\nthe left were over the Marketing folder,\n\n55\n00:02:30.649 --> 00:02:32.930\nthe checkmarks are black.\n\n56\n00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.863\nWhereas on the right,\nthe properties of the Images folder,\n\n57\n00:02:36.863 --> 00:02:39.647\nthe subfolder, the checkmarks are gray.\n\n58\n00:02:39.647 --> 00:02:43.720\nAnd it's not just a glitch in\nthe video feed or anything like that.\n\n59\n00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.536\nThey're actually different and\n\n60\n00:02:45.536 --> 00:02:48.785\nthey have meaning,or the difference\ndoes have a meaning.\n\n61\n00:02:48.785 --> 00:02:53.320\nThe black check marks indicate\nexplicit permissions.\n\n62\n00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:58.113\nThat means the permissions were\nassigned right here to this object.\n\n63\n00:02:58.113 --> 00:03:02.552\nThe gray check marks indicate that\nthe permission was inherited from\n\n64\n00:03:02.552 --> 00:03:03.937\nsomewhere up above.\n\n65\n00:03:03.937 --> 00:03:08.158\nIt might be the direct parent, it might be\ntwo or three levels up, you have no way\n\n66\n00:03:08.158 --> 00:03:12.040\nof knowing, but the grey check marks\nindicate inherited permissions.\n\n67\n00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.708\nSo if you think about what we did,\n\n68\n00:03:13.708 --> 00:03:17.175\nwe assigned the permissions directly\nto the marketing data folder.\n\n69\n00:03:17.175 --> 00:03:21.135\nI right-clicked on it, pulled up\nthe properties, went to the security tab,\n\n70\n00:03:21.135 --> 00:03:23.550\nclicked Add and\nI assigned those permissions.\n\n71\n00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:27.456\nThat's explicitly assigning permissions\nover that particular resource,\n\n72\n00:03:27.456 --> 00:03:29.505\nin this case the marketing data folder.\n\n73\n00:03:29.505 --> 00:03:34.172\nThen those permissions automatically\ninherited down to all the files and\n\n74\n00:03:34.172 --> 00:03:39.375\nsub-folders and sub-files inside there,\nsuch as the Images folder over here.\n\n75\n00:03:39.375 --> 00:03:44.295\nAnd that is why those check marks\nare gray, because they are inherited.\n\n76\n00:03:44.295 --> 00:03:49.310\nSo quick easy visual indicator, whether or\nnot the permissions are inherited,\n\n77\n00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:52.052\nor whether they're explicitly assigned.\n\n78\n00:03:52.052 --> 00:03:56.776\nThe reason it's important to understand\nthat difference is because we can change\n\n79\n00:03:56.776 --> 00:03:58.220\nexplicit permissions.\n\n80\n00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:03.378\nIf I decide I don't wanna give marketing\nthose read and write permissions anymore,\n\n81\n00:04:03.378 --> 00:04:07.910\nor maybe I wanna add,\nI wanna give marketing modify permissions.\n\n82\n00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:10.445\nWell I can go and I can,\nwhat's a good way to show you this?\n\n83\n00:04:10.445 --> 00:04:12.920\nWell we'll do it this way,\nI'm gonna cancel out.\n\n84\n00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:16.587\nAnd so the permissions for\nthe marketing data, I'm gonna click Edit.\n\n85\n00:04:16.587 --> 00:04:17.852\nAnd I'm gonna go Marketing.\n\n86\n00:04:17.852 --> 00:04:21.770\nAnd I can see what they already have,\nread, list, read and write.\n\n87\n00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:25.665\nAnd I'm gonna add modify to that,\nand I'm gonna click OK.\n\n88\n00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:29.426\nAnd I'll go ahead and,\nwe'll leave that open.\n\n89\n00:04:29.426 --> 00:04:35.442\nNow I'm gonna go back to Images,\npull up those properties.\n\n90\n00:04:35.442 --> 00:04:40.418\nGo to Security tab, Marketing, and\nnotice they now have modified permissions.\n\n91\n00:04:40.418 --> 00:04:43.454\nSo I made a change to the permissions and\n\n92\n00:04:43.454 --> 00:04:47.227\nthe change inherited down\nto the child objects.\n\n93\n00:04:47.227 --> 00:04:52.528\nWell let's say I don't want them to have\nmodify permissions over the Images folder.\n\n94\n00:04:52.528 --> 00:04:55.718\nThey shouldn't be messing with the images,\nsomebody made these graphics,\n\n95\n00:04:55.718 --> 00:04:59.100\nthey put them in there,\nmaybe they're not supposed to be changed.\n\n96\n00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:01.631\nSo I'm gonna take away their\nmodify permission here.\n\n97\n00:05:01.631 --> 00:05:06.722\nWell, if I click Edit,\nall right, I got a problem.\n\n98\n00:05:06.722 --> 00:05:11.128\nI look at Marketing and\nthe check marks are grayed out.\n\n99\n00:05:11.128 --> 00:05:12.952\nI can't undo that.\n\n100\n00:05:12.952 --> 00:05:17.664\nYou cannot change inherited\npermissions in this way.\n\n101\n00:05:17.664 --> 00:05:21.410\nOnce it inherits those permissions,\nthose are set.\n\n102\n00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:26.612\nThere's three ways you can go about\nchanging inherited permissions.\n\n103\n00:05:26.612 --> 00:05:29.360\nOne would be what you just saw,\n\n104\n00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:34.660\nis to modify them wherever\nthey're explicitly assigned.\n\n105\n00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:38.223\nI can't change them here because\nthey're being inherited.\n\n106\n00:05:38.223 --> 00:05:42.434\nWhat I can do is go to where\nthe permissions are being inherited from,\n\n107\n00:05:42.434 --> 00:05:44.770\nwhich in this case is Marketing data.\n\n108\n00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:47.293\nSo I can go to that security tab.\n\n109\n00:05:47.293 --> 00:05:51.240\nAnd I can click Edit and go to Marketing.\n\n110\n00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:53.140\nThen I can uncheck modify.\n\n111\n00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:57.517\nSo I can find out where the permissions\nwere explicitly assigned and\n\n112\n00:05:57.517 --> 00:05:59.067\nmake the change there.\n\n113\n00:05:59.067 --> 00:06:01.245\nThat's one way to change\ninherited permissions.\n\n114\n00:06:01.245 --> 00:06:03.533\nHere's what you have to keep in\nmind with that method, though.\n\n115\n00:06:03.533 --> 00:06:08.195\nRemember, those permissions are inheriting\ndown to not just the Images folder, but\n\n116\n00:06:08.195 --> 00:06:09.695\neverything inside there.\n\n117\n00:06:09.695 --> 00:06:13.439\nSo if I wanted to take away modify\njust over the Images folder,\n\n118\n00:06:13.439 --> 00:06:18.565\nthis method wouldn't work, because you're\ntaking away modify from everything.\n\n119\n00:06:18.565 --> 00:06:19.975\nLet's do that again.\n\n120\n00:06:19.975 --> 00:06:25.064\nProperties, Security,\nMarketing, I took away modify.\n\n121\n00:06:25.064 --> 00:06:30.254\nSo if we go inside there, Images,\nProperties, Security, Marketing,\n\n122\n00:06:30.254 --> 00:06:34.880\nsure enough,\nthey don't have modify permission anymore.\n\n123\n00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:35.666\nThat's good.\n\n124\n00:06:35.666 --> 00:06:40.612\nExcept for the fact that these files, if\nI take a look at Security and Marketing,\n\n125\n00:06:40.612 --> 00:06:43.760\nthey don't have modify\npermissions here either.\n\n126\n00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:46.703\nAnd that's not what I wanted to do.\n\n127\n00:06:46.703 --> 00:06:50.636\nSo the first way you can change inherited\npermissions is to find out where they're\n\n128\n00:06:50.636 --> 00:06:52.807\nexplicitly assigned and change them there.\n\n129\n00:06:52.807 --> 00:06:56.192\nJust keep in mind that it changes\neverywhere those inherited.\n\n130\n00:06:56.192 --> 00:06:56.743\n&gt;&gt; It's a trickle effect.\n\n131\n00:06:56.743 --> 00:06:58.055\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Trickle down effect.\n\n132\n00:06:58.055 --> 00:07:02.402\n&gt;&gt; So everywhere those permissions are\nbeing inherited, you are modifying that.\n\n133\n00:07:02.402 --> 00:07:07.367\nThe second way to change\ninherited permissions would\n\n134\n00:07:07.367 --> 00:07:12.007\nbe to block inheritance,\nor make them explicit.\n\n135\n00:07:12.007 --> 00:07:14.700\nFor example, well actually,\nlet me back up.\n\n136\n00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:16.345\nBefore we go there, let me do one more.\n\n137\n00:07:16.345 --> 00:07:19.655\nYou can assign the opposite permission.\n\n138\n00:07:19.655 --> 00:07:21.940\nYou can actually assign\nthe opposite permission.\n\n139\n00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:26.309\nLet's set it back, let's go back to\nMarketing, Properties, Security,\n\n140\n00:07:26.309 --> 00:07:27.071\nMarketing.\n\n141\n00:07:27.071 --> 00:07:31.701\nI'm gonna edit and I'm gonna give\nthem that modified permission back.\n\n142\n00:07:31.701 --> 00:07:34.345\nSo we can kind of reset our slate.\n\n143\n00:07:34.345 --> 00:07:39.521\nSo now, when I go into Images,\nand I pull up those Properties,\n\n144\n00:07:39.521 --> 00:07:47.050\nand I go Security and Edit, and Marketing,\nI can see they are inheriting modify.\n\n145\n00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:49.408\nBut I know I can't go to the parent and\nchange it there,\n\n146\n00:07:49.408 --> 00:07:52.711\nbecause that affects all those other\nfiles and that's not what I want to do.\n\n147\n00:07:52.711 --> 00:07:57.031\nSo what I can do is go to here,\nwhere they're being inherited, and\n\n148\n00:07:57.031 --> 00:07:59.281\nassign the opposite permission.\n\n149\n00:07:59.281 --> 00:08:04.303\nIf I assign the opposite permission,\nWell that is going to override those\n\n150\n00:08:04.303 --> 00:08:10.030\ninherent information and this is one of\nthose rules that we need to talk about.\n\n151\n00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:14.510\nThere is an order of precedence\nwhen it comes to permissions.\n\n152\n00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:20.990\nExplicit denies will override\ninherited allows, right?\n\n153\n00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:25.850\nThere's a lot of people will try to say\nthat denies always override allows,\n\n154\n00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:27.760\nthat's not quite true.\n\n155\n00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:31.570\nBecause explicit allows can\noverride inherited denies.\n\n156\n00:08:31.570 --> 00:08:35.880\nBut that's probably going beyond what\nwe need to do for this particular exam.\n\n157\n00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:41.030\nBut at this point, I just want you\nto understand that an explicit\n\n158\n00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:46.200\ndeny will override any inherited allows.\n\n159\n00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:50.500\nNow this is probably gonna cause a problem\nfor me, because notice when you deny\n\n160\n00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:55.040\nmodify, remember what modify does, is it\nbuilds on all these other permissions.\n\n161\n00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:57.100\nSo I'm denying read and write,\n\n162\n00:08:57.100 --> 00:09:00.925\nwhich really isn't gonna help\nme in this case, all right.\n\n163\n00:09:00.925 --> 00:09:04.304\nBut as a method to change\ninherited permissions,\n\n164\n00:09:04.304 --> 00:09:06.402\nthis is one way you could do it.\n\n165\n00:09:06.402 --> 00:09:11.930\nModify not so much, but let's say I\njust wanted them not to write, right?\n\n166\n00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:15.020\nI can actually check,\nlet me zoom in for you here.\n\n167\n00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:17.655\nI can say, deny write,\nthey'll still have read permission,\n\n168\n00:09:17.655 --> 00:09:19.757\nthat's being inherited\nfrom the parent object.\n\n169\n00:09:19.757 --> 00:09:23.367\nThey'll still have read and\nexecute, but they won't have write.\n\n170\n00:09:23.367 --> 00:09:28.155\nEven though they are inheriting an allow\nwrite, an explicit deny write has\n\n171\n00:09:28.155 --> 00:09:32.343\nbeing assigned and that will all\noverride that inherited allow.\n\n172\n00:09:32.343 --> 00:09:36.071\n&gt;&gt; So Mike it seems like this is a quick\nfix for a problem that you may be having.\n\n173\n00:09:36.071 --> 00:09:40.296\nBut in the long run it could become a\nlittle muddy if you don't really document\n\n174\n00:09:40.296 --> 00:09:42.530\nor pay attention to what you're doing.\n\n175\n00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:47.225\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, definitely documentation\nis a must when it comes to this.\n\n176\n00:09:47.225 --> 00:09:49.673\nAnytime you use denies,\nMicrosoft will warn you.\n\n177\n00:09:49.673 --> 00:09:52.859\nIn fact watch if I click Apply,\nI'm gonna get a big fat warning,\n\n178\n00:09:52.859 --> 00:09:55.030\nyou are setting a deny permission.\n\n179\n00:09:55.030 --> 00:09:57.000\nAnd it goes, and\nyou guys should read that message.\n\n180\n00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.190\nIt's basically saying that,\ndenies can cause all kinds of problems,\n\n181\n00:10:00.190 --> 00:10:04.620\nbecause of the fact that an explicit\ndeny is at the top of the precedence.\n\n182\n00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:06.880\nIt ends up overriding other permissions,\n\n183\n00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:11.410\nand it can cause issues when it\ncomes to troubleshooting, all right.\n\n184\n00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:17.228\nIf I, at the past I denied Cherokee's\naccount access to this resource.\n\n185\n00:10:17.228 --> 00:10:21.582\nLater on, an administrator then\ntries to give the edutainer's group\n\n186\n00:10:21.582 --> 00:10:26.151\npermissions over a And Cherokee\ncomplains that she can't get access.\n\n187\n00:10:26.151 --> 00:10:29.893\nAnd it's because that deny that\nsomebody did a long time ago is,\n\n188\n00:10:29.893 --> 00:10:32.597\neven though the edutainers\nhave permission,\n\n189\n00:10:32.597 --> 00:10:35.854\nthe denies end up overriding it and\nit causes problems.\n\n190\n00:10:35.854 --> 00:10:41.070\nSo it will warn you, and I'm not going to,\nI just wanted to show you that method.\n\n191\n00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:43.280\nAll right, so\nI said there were three methods.\n\n192\n00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:48.380\nYou could find where the permissions were\nexplicitly allowed, change them there.\n\n193\n00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:51.490\nYou could also assign\nthe opposite permission,\n\n194\n00:10:51.490 --> 00:10:54.340\nthat's one way to modify\ninherited permissions.\n\n195\n00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:57.800\nThe third way is to\nchange the inheritance.\n\n196\n00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:00.997\nIf these weren't gray checkmarks,\nif they were black checkmarks,\n\n197\n00:11:00.997 --> 00:11:02.217\nthen I could change them.\n\n198\n00:11:02.217 --> 00:11:05.974\nSo how can I stop that,\nhow could I fix that?\n\n199\n00:11:05.974 --> 00:11:10.601\nAll right I can click on my\nadvanced permissions down here, and\n\n200\n00:11:10.601 --> 00:11:17.130\nthere's a box right down here at the\nbottom left that says Disable inheritance.\n\n201\n00:11:17.130 --> 00:11:22.470\nIf I click that, think about\nthis folder has a parent object,\n\n202\n00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:25.190\nup higher in the hierarchy.\n\n203\n00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:29.360\nAnd if I choose Disable inheritance,\nwhat I'm doing is saying no longer,\n\n204\n00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:32.550\nalmost like building a wall,\nright, between that parent object.\n\n205\n00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:36.170\nYou're saying, don't inherit\npermissions from the parent object, so\n\n206\n00:11:36.170 --> 00:11:36.790\nI'm gonna click that.\n\n207\n00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:42.760\nNow, it's gonna ask me a question when\nI do this, because the way NTFS works,\n\n208\n00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:46.320\nas soon as you've created the subfolder\nit automatically inherited\n\n209\n00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:47.380\npermissions, right?\n\n210\n00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:51.100\nWhen I created the first folder, marketing\ndata, and then I went inside there and\n\n211\n00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:52.900\ncreated the images folder.\n\n212\n00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:56.830\nWell, as soon as I created that folder,\nit did what it is supposed to do and\n\n213\n00:11:56.830 --> 00:11:58.450\ninherited permissions.\n\n214\n00:11:58.450 --> 00:12:01.610\nNow I've decided I don't want\nit to inherit permissions, but\n\n215\n00:12:01.610 --> 00:12:03.540\nit's already inherited permissions.\n\n216\n00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:04.924\nSo what this is asking me is,\n\n217\n00:12:04.924 --> 00:12:08.642\nwhat do you want me to do with the\npermissions that I've already inherited?\n\n218\n00:12:08.642 --> 00:12:13.228\nDo you want me to leave them there and\nconvert them to explicit permissions?\n\n219\n00:12:13.228 --> 00:12:17.400\nThey are no longer tied to the parent and\nyou'll be able to make changes to them.\n\n220\n00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:21.148\nOr do you want me to wipe the slate\nclean and start with a clean sheet and\n\n221\n00:12:21.148 --> 00:12:23.359\nallow you to change those permissions?\n\n222\n00:12:23.359 --> 00:12:25.681\nAll right,\nthat's what they're asking here.\n\n223\n00:12:25.681 --> 00:12:29.710\n&gt;&gt; That sounds like a lot of work,\nto have to go back and then decide.\n\n224\n00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:33.400\n&gt;&gt; You can get yourself into trouble,\nI've done this before.\n\n225\n00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:35.830\nBy removing all inherited permissions,\nright,\n\n226\n00:12:35.830 --> 00:12:41.410\nif I click this, notice there's nobody\nleft in the access control list.\n\n227\n00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:45.107\nIf I was to go ahead and click OK and\napply, all right, in fact, yeah,\n\n228\n00:12:45.107 --> 00:12:46.446\nlet's do it, shall we?\n\n229\n00:12:46.446 --> 00:12:46.989\nWanna live on the edge?\n\n230\n00:12:46.989 --> 00:12:48.340\n&gt;&gt; No, I don't.\n[LAUGH]\n\n231\n00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:49.000\n&gt;&gt; Come on, let's do it anyway.\n\n232\n00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.634\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You have denied access to all\n\n233\n00:12:51.634 --> 00:12:52.513\nusers, right?\n\n234\n00:12:52.513 --> 00:12:54.306\nNo one will be able to access this folder.\n\n235\n00:12:54.306 --> 00:13:00.159\nI'm gonna say yes, and look,\nnow I have a whole lot of nothing, right?\n\n236\n00:13:00.159 --> 00:13:06.910\nAnd so now if I try to, and I'm the domain\nadmin by the way, I get denied access.\n\n237\n00:13:06.910 --> 00:13:10.940\nSo one of the things you have to keep in\nmind if you use that option to remove\n\n238\n00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:14.530\npermissions and start with a clean slate,\nyou gotta add everything back.\n\n239\n00:13:14.530 --> 00:13:18.070\nThings like system, so that the system\nhas access to that folder, right?\n\n240\n00:13:18.070 --> 00:13:21.170\nAll of that stuff has to be added back, so\n\n241\n00:13:21.170 --> 00:13:23.800\nyou're typically better off\nchoosing the other one.\n\n242\n00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:28.120\nConvert them to explicit and\nthen making changes, so let me undo this.\n\n243\n00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:31.940\nOne good thing about being the domain\nadmin, even though I don't have access to\n\n244\n00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:35.980\nthe resource, I do have access\nto the access control list.\n\n245\n00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:39.220\nSo I can come in here and\nI can click Advanced, and\n\n246\n00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:40.910\nI'm gonna turn inheritance back on.\n\n247\n00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:44.770\nAnd apply that, so\nit picks up all those permissions and\n\n248\n00:13:44.770 --> 00:13:49.010\nnow we should be able to get back\ninto our images folder, all right.\n\n249\n00:13:49.010 --> 00:13:54.195\nSo let me pull up those properties again,\ngo to the Security tab,\n\n250\n00:13:54.195 --> 00:13:57.520\nclick Advanced, Disable inheritance.\n\n251\n00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:00.390\nAnd this time instead or\nremove all inherited permissions,\n\n252\n00:14:00.390 --> 00:14:03.499\nI'm gonna choose Covert inherited\npermissions into explicit permissions.\n\n253\n00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:09.160\nNow, if you notice this column\nsays inherited from None, right.\n\n254\n00:14:11.050 --> 00:14:14.088\nLet me zoom back out and click OK, and\n\n255\n00:14:14.088 --> 00:14:18.120\nnotice now marketing\nthe check marks are black.\n\n256\n00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:20.624\nThey're no longer gray, they're being,\n\n257\n00:14:20.624 --> 00:14:23.609\nthey're explicitly assigned\nhere at this folder.\n\n258\n00:14:23.609 --> 00:14:28.361\nI can click edit, and\nI can take away that modified permission,\n\n259\n00:14:28.361 --> 00:14:32.503\nbut leave read and write,\nand click OK, then click OK.\n\n260\n00:14:32.503 --> 00:14:36.522\nSo I have modified inherited permissions,\nreally by changing them or\n\n261\n00:14:36.522 --> 00:14:39.880\nconverting them into explicit permissions.\n\n262\n00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:42.700\nNow what about the files inside images?\n\n263\n00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:46.972\nWell you changed the parent object,\nin this case the images folder, So\n\n264\n00:14:46.972 --> 00:14:51.613\nthey should not have modified\npermission over these files.\n\n265\n00:14:51.613 --> 00:14:53.706\nWhich, they actually do.\n\n266\n00:14:53.706 --> 00:14:54.980\nDid they?\n\n267\n00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:59.348\nIt does look like they've\ngot modified permissions, so\n\n268\n00:14:59.348 --> 00:15:03.443\nsomething went terribly\nwrong in my demonstration.\n\n269\n00:15:03.443 --> 00:15:07.100\nLet's see where we\nare inheriting those from.\n\n270\n00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:10.203\nMaybe I just have not\napplied that change yet.\n\n271\n00:15:10.203 --> 00:15:12.034\nLet's double check that.\n\n272\n00:15:12.034 --> 00:15:14.900\nLet's go back into images.\n\n273\n00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:19.277\nThere's security, marketing,\nand I gave them modified.\n\n274\n00:15:19.277 --> 00:15:20.311\nYou know what?\n\n275\n00:15:20.311 --> 00:15:22.936\nI did not click apply, I must not have.\n\n276\n00:15:22.936 --> 00:15:24.845\nSo I'm gonna do that again.\n\n277\n00:15:24.845 --> 00:15:27.160\nI'm gonna click edit.\n\n278\n00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:29.860\nI think I took it away\nfrom authenticated users.\n\n279\n00:15:29.860 --> 00:15:31.943\nI did not select the right ace.\n\n280\n00:15:31.943 --> 00:15:37.576\n&gt;&gt; Okay, and you know I was going to say,\nnow may be a good time to talk about our,\n\n281\n00:15:37.576 --> 00:15:42.371\nnow I can't even think of the word,\nthe effective permissions.\n\n282\n00:15:42.371 --> 00:15:43.295\n&gt;&gt; Effective permissions.\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n\n283\n00:15:43.295 --> 00:15:45.135\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely, we're gonna\ndefinitely take a look at that.\n\n284\n00:15:45.135 --> 00:15:46.205\n&gt;&gt; Cuz it could help\nyou in this situation.\n\n285\n00:15:46.205 --> 00:15:49.427\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I forgot, when I took away modify,\n\n286\n00:15:49.427 --> 00:15:54.298\nI think I still had authenticated users\nselected here, so I made the wrong change.\n\n287\n00:15:54.298 --> 00:15:57.882\nSo let's take away, so marketing,\nImages folder, marketing,\n\n288\n00:15:57.882 --> 00:16:01.021\nthey're no longer gray because\nwe blocked inheritance.\n\n289\n00:16:01.021 --> 00:16:04.258\nI can take away modify,\nI can click OK And okay.\n\n290\n00:16:04.258 --> 00:16:08.563\nAnd if I go inside images, and\ntake a look at these properties,\n\n291\n00:16:08.563 --> 00:16:13.830\nthen I go to security, marketing no\nlonger has modified permissions.\n\n292\n00:16:13.830 --> 00:16:14.980\nNow these are still inherent,\n\n293\n00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:18.850\nI can't change those, they're\ninheriting from that images folder.\n\n294\n00:16:19.990 --> 00:16:22.030\nAll right, so Cherokee,\nyou brought up a great point, and\n\n295\n00:16:22.030 --> 00:16:25.610\nthat is, how do we-\n&gt;&gt; Sort things out.\n\n296\n00:16:25.610 --> 00:16:29.760\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it can be a little bit tricky\ntrying to figure out what permissions\n\n297\n00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:34.320\na user has, especially if we\nare following best practices.\n\n298\n00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:40.530\nBecause if I look at the practices of\nthis image, right, and I wanna know\n\n299\n00:16:40.530 --> 00:16:46.560\nwhat permission Hannah has over this\nresource, do I see Hannah in the list?\n\n300\n00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:47.330\nI don't.\n\n301\n00:16:47.330 --> 00:16:49.280\nBecause we're using groups.\n\n302\n00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:53.640\nAnd do I know what users are in what\ngroups and have all that memorized?\n\n303\n00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:56.480\nMaybe in a small organization,\nbut probably not.\n\n304\n00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:59.800\nSo I can't tell what\npermission Hannah has.\n\n305\n00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:02.900\nBut what I can do is go into\nmy advanced permissions, so\n\n306\n00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:05.240\noff of the security tab, click advanced.\n\n307\n00:17:06.310 --> 00:17:09.910\nAnd there's an effective access tab,\nall right?\n\n308\n00:17:09.910 --> 00:17:14.790\nAnd we'll click on that tab and\nI'm going to select a user.\n\n309\n00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:18.960\nAnd let's find Hannah.\n\n310\n00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:20.820\nSee, I've found Hannah's account.\n\n311\n00:17:20.820 --> 00:17:22.550\nI'm not worried about devices.\n\n312\n00:17:22.550 --> 00:17:26.380\nI'm gonna click \"View\nEffective Access\" and if we look,\n\n313\n00:17:27.950 --> 00:17:31.500\nwe'll see a nice little chart that breaks\ndown, I can see they have read and\n\n314\n00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:38.270\nwrite permissions, but not full control\nand not delete, which would be our modify.\n\n315\n00:17:38.270 --> 00:17:42.470\nSo this is how you can determine what\npermissions a user has over a resource\n\n316\n00:17:42.470 --> 00:17:44.080\nwithout having to through.\n\n317\n00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:47.970\nBecause the only other way to do this is\nto look at the access control list and\n\n318\n00:17:47.970 --> 00:17:51.100\ngo, marketing has such and\nsuch permission.\n\n319\n00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:53.570\nNow, let me go find out\nwho belongs to marketing.\n\n320\n00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:58.410\nBut that's not always avery efficient\nway to do it and here's why.\n\n321\n00:17:58.410 --> 00:18:02.670\nRemember I said back at the beginning,\nwhen you belong to a group,\n\n322\n00:18:02.670 --> 00:18:05.760\nyou get to pick up the permissions\nthat were assigned to that group.\n\n323\n00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:06.600\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n324\n00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:11.202\nBut a group is a membership list, and\nI can belong to more than one group.\n\n325\n00:18:11.202 --> 00:18:13.280\nWhat if my user account belongs\nto more than one group?\n\n326\n00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:14.170\n&gt;&gt; Multiple groups, yeah.\n\n327\n00:18:14.170 --> 00:18:18.100\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I get to pick up the permissions\nfrom all the groups I belong to.\n\n328\n00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:23.610\nNTFS permissions are what we call\ncumulative, meaning we get to add them up.\n\n329\n00:18:23.610 --> 00:18:26.760\nIf I belong to marketing, and\n\n330\n00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:32.620\nI get right permission, I also belong\nto sales, and I give read permission.\n\n331\n00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:36.360\nWell because I belong to both of those\ngroup, I get to add up those permissions.\n\n332\n00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:40.390\nI would, in the end, have read and\nwrite permission, all right?\n\n333\n00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:46.050\nAlso keep in mind that denies are gonna\noverride, so you could belong to five\n\n334\n00:18:46.050 --> 00:18:50.180\ndifferent groups and four of those\ngroups were given full control.\n\n335\n00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:52.070\nBut the fifth one was denied.\n\n336\n00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:55.040\nThat one deny will override\nall of those other allows.\n\n337\n00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:56.420\nSo keep that in mind as well.\n\n338\n00:18:56.420 --> 00:19:00.090\nThose denies are gonna\nbe like a Trump card.\n\n339\n00:19:00.090 --> 00:19:01.160\n&gt;&gt; Pretty invasive, yeah.\n\n340\n00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:04.285\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\nAnd it's, you know, when you use denies,\n\n341\n00:19:04.285 --> 00:19:09.090\nthere's really, you have to have\na special reason to use a deny,\n\n342\n00:19:09.090 --> 00:19:13.960\nbecause Windows operates on,\nwhat's called an implicit deny process.\n\n343\n00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:18.970\nIn other words, when you look at\nthat access control list, all right,\n\n344\n00:19:18.970 --> 00:19:22.900\nwhen you look at this DACL,\nif your user account or\n\n345\n00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:28.250\none of the groups you belong to is not\nin this list, you don't get access,\n\n346\n00:19:28.250 --> 00:19:33.390\nright, because you haven't been assigned\nany permissions, so it's an implicit deny.\n\n347\n00:19:33.390 --> 00:19:38.000\nI don't have to add you and\nthen specifically or explicitly deny you.\n\n348\n00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.850\nI can just make sure\nyou're not in the list and\n\n349\n00:19:40.850 --> 00:19:42.450\nyou won't get access to the resource.\n\n350\n00:19:44.210 --> 00:19:49.610\nThe reason we would use\ndenies on explicit deny is,\n\n351\n00:19:49.610 --> 00:19:53.390\nI don't want to take the,\nhow is the good way to say this.\n\n352\n00:19:53.390 --> 00:19:56.680\nIf I rely on the implicit deny,\nin other words, Cherokee,\n\n353\n00:19:56.680 --> 00:20:00.200\nI didn't add her to the list,\nthe edutainers group is not in the list.\n\n354\n00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:03.720\nCherokee doesn't have permissions over the\nresource, somewhere down the line though,\n\n355\n00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:08.040\nsome other administrator could add\nthe edutainers to that resource.\n\n356\n00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:11.640\nAnd by doing so,\ngive Cherokee access to the resource, and\n\n357\n00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:14.330\nI wanted to make sure\nCherokee didn't have access.\n\n358\n00:20:14.330 --> 00:20:17.260\nSo in that case,\nan implicit deny is not gonna be enough.\n\n359\n00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:22.370\nThat's when I want to use the explicit\ndeny, is by explicitly denying Cherokee.\n\n360\n00:20:22.370 --> 00:20:23.975\n&gt;&gt; Now that's just harsh, Mike.\n\n361\n00:20:23.975 --> 00:20:24.830\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I know, sorry.\n\n362\n00:20:24.830 --> 00:20:27.510\nJust kinda picking on Cherokee,\nshe's standing here.\n\n363\n00:20:27.510 --> 00:20:33.230\nBut now if some other admin later on added\nthe edutainers group to that resource and\n\n364\n00:20:33.230 --> 00:20:35.860\ngave them permission,\nshe still wouldn't have access\n\n365\n00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:40.150\nbecause I explicitly denied her\nthat particular access, all right?\n\n366\n00:20:41.310 --> 00:20:43.650\nSo a lot to NTFS permissions.\n\n367\n00:20:43.650 --> 00:20:46.820\nLet's do a couple example here and\n\n368\n00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:51.640\nsee if we can't get kind of,\nwhat's the word I'm looking for?\n\n369\n00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:56.570\nA better visual on what's going on here\nand I'm gonna show that effective access.\n\n370\n00:20:56.570 --> 00:21:01.830\nSo I'm gonna go to marketing data and\nif we go to that security tab,\n\n371\n00:21:01.830 --> 00:21:07.200\nwe've added the marketing group and\nwe've given them modify permissions.\n\n372\n00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:08.050\nI'm gonna change this.\n\n373\n00:21:08.050 --> 00:21:13.760\nI'm gonna click edit and again,\nthis is not a very practical example but\n\n374\n00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:16.090\nit will prove our point here.\n\n375\n00:21:16.090 --> 00:21:20.320\nI'm gonna give marketing,\nwrite permissions over that without read.\n\n376\n00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:21.770\nI know that's kind of odd.\n\n377\n00:21:21.770 --> 00:21:22.270\nAll right.\n\n378\n00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:26.340\nAnd that should it all\nthe way down through.\n\n379\n00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:28.800\nLike if we look at one of these files,\nproperties,\n\n380\n00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:33.800\nsecurity, marketing as right\npermission but no read, all right?\n\n381\n00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:38.202\nNow I'm gonna go back out to\nmarketing data, properties,\n\n382\n00:21:38.202 --> 00:21:43.100\nsecurity, and edit, and\nI'm gonna add the sales group,\n\n383\n00:21:45.620 --> 00:21:50.270\nand I'm gonna give the sales group\njust write permission, all right?\n\n384\n00:21:50.270 --> 00:21:51.670\nIn fact, we'll make it really simple.\n\n385\n00:21:51.670 --> 00:21:56.120\nWe'll just give them read permission,\nand I'll click OK and OK.\n\n386\n00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:59.450\nSo at this point, sales has read.\n\n387\n00:21:59.450 --> 00:22:00.320\n&gt;&gt; Marketing has write.\n\n388\n00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:02.520\n&gt;&gt; Marketing has write, okay?\n\n389\n00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:03.290\nLet's go take a look.\n\n390\n00:22:03.290 --> 00:22:04.669\nI'm gonna right-click Properties.\n\n391\n00:22:06.190 --> 00:22:11.640\nAnd I'm gonna go to the security tab and\nadvanced, and then effective access.\n\n392\n00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:16.860\nAnd I'm gonna select a user,\nand let's start with marketing.\n\n393\n00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:20.817\nSo Hannah Right?\n\n394\n00:22:20.817 --> 00:22:24.522\nAnd I'm gonna click view effective access,\nand I'm gonna blow this up so\n\n395\n00:22:24.522 --> 00:22:28.642\nwe can see it, and we will see that,\nsure enough, Hannah has right permissions,\n\n396\n00:22:28.642 --> 00:22:31.120\njust still has read,\ndid I not make that change?\n\n397\n00:22:32.420 --> 00:22:35.160\nI've got my data authenticated users.\n\n398\n00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:37.900\nLet's edit, let's make this really simple.\n\n399\n00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:39.020\nI'm going to remove.\n\n400\n00:22:40.110 --> 00:22:43.970\nIt's being inherited,\nit's not gonna make this easy.\n\n401\n00:22:45.770 --> 00:22:46.980\nLet's do this.\n\n402\n00:22:46.980 --> 00:22:49.100\nWe know how to fix that, right?\n\n403\n00:22:49.100 --> 00:22:55.230\nI'm going to click advanced, and\nI'm going to disable inheritance.\n\n404\n00:22:55.230 --> 00:22:58.860\nThen I'm gonna convert them so\nthat I can make changes.\n\n405\n00:22:58.860 --> 00:23:02.380\nI'll click OK and\nI'm gonna remove authenticated users.\n\n406\n00:23:04.538 --> 00:23:10.780\nSo let's just get rid of them and\nI'm gonna get rid of users.\n\n407\n00:23:11.850 --> 00:23:13.450\nI think we should be good.\n\n408\n00:23:13.450 --> 00:23:14.970\nI'll click OK, okay.\nAll right, so\n\n409\n00:23:14.970 --> 00:23:18.430\nI wanted to reset some things so we\ncould really focus on just marketing and\n\n410\n00:23:18.430 --> 00:23:20.700\njust sales so we can see what's going on.\n\n411\n00:23:20.700 --> 00:23:23.390\nThe authenticated users group\nincludes everybody, right?\n\n412\n00:23:23.390 --> 00:23:26.820\nAs soon as you log in, you're part of the\nauthenticated users, and that group was\n\n413\n00:23:26.820 --> 00:23:31.100\ninheriting permissions, so it's gonna\nthrow our demo off just a little bit.\n\n414\n00:23:31.100 --> 00:23:35.350\nSo now I'm gonna pull up the Properties,\nand we're gonna go to that Security tab.\n\n415\n00:23:35.350 --> 00:23:38.350\nAnd I'm gonna click [INAUDIBLE] advance.\n\n416\n00:23:38.350 --> 00:23:39.230\nAnd effective access.\n\n417\n00:23:39.230 --> 00:23:44.170\nAnd we're gonna select our sales,\nour marketing person Hannah.\n\n418\n00:23:44.170 --> 00:23:45.480\nView effective access.\n\n419\n00:23:46.610 --> 00:23:50.520\nAnd we should see that they just\nhave right permissions, right?\n\n420\n00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:51.630\nWrite data.\n\n421\n00:23:51.630 --> 00:23:52.550\nAppend data.\n\n422\n00:23:52.550 --> 00:23:53.780\nWrite attributes.\n\n423\n00:23:53.780 --> 00:23:55.170\nWrite extended attributes.\n\n424\n00:23:55.170 --> 00:23:56.450\nBut no read.\n\n425\n00:23:56.450 --> 00:23:58.961\nWhich is what we expected,\nthat's what we assigned.\n\n426\n00:23:58.961 --> 00:24:02.606\nLet's pick another user that's in sales.\n\n427\n00:24:02.606 --> 00:24:06.110\nAnd we've got Albert over there in sales.\n\n428\n00:24:06.110 --> 00:24:08.116\nAnd we'll view effective access.\n\n429\n00:24:08.116 --> 00:24:11.120\nAnd notice Albert only has read.\n\n430\n00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:14.610\nRead data, read attributes, read extended\nattributes, and read permissions.\n\n431\n00:24:14.610 --> 00:24:15.280\nBut no write.\n\n432\n00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:15.820\n&gt;&gt; No writes.\n\n433\n00:24:15.820 --> 00:24:17.120\n&gt;&gt; Which is expected, right?\n\n434\n00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:19.114\nThat's what we assigned.\n\n435\n00:24:19.114 --> 00:24:23.410\nAll right, now what we're gonna do is\nwe're gonna flip over to the domain\n\n436\n00:24:23.410 --> 00:24:26.687\ncontroller, and\nI'm gonna make a new user real quick.\n\n437\n00:24:30.241 --> 00:24:34.070\nPeter.\n\n438\n00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:34.850\n&gt;&gt; Van Rysdan.\n\n439\n00:24:34.850 --> 00:24:35.990\nHow do you spell that?\n\n440\n00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:36.617\n&gt;&gt; I'm not sure if I got that right,\nPeter.\n\n441\n00:24:36.617 --> 00:24:39.542\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm sorry if I did not.\n\n442\n00:24:39.542 --> 00:24:42.053\nI came close, I think.\n\n443\n00:24:42.053 --> 00:24:43.730\nPeter is gonna be good enough for log in.\n\n444\n00:24:43.730 --> 00:24:45.220\n&gt;&gt; That's why he goes by PBR.\n\n445\n00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:48.914\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n446\n00:24:48.914 --> 00:24:49.961\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n447\n00:24:49.961 --> 00:24:55.300\na new user who currently should have\nno access to that resource, right?\n\n448\n00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:59.701\nIf I go back over to my client,\nand we select the user account,\n\n449\n00:25:02.371 --> 00:25:08.430\nPeter, and we view effective access,\nwe see it's got a whole lot of nothing.\n\n450\n00:25:08.430 --> 00:25:12.730\nOkay, let's go back over to\nmy domain controller, and\n\n451\n00:25:12.730 --> 00:25:15.990\nlet's add Peter to a group.\n\n452\n00:25:15.990 --> 00:25:20.522\nI'm gonna add the group, and\nwe're gonna add him to marketing.\n\n453\n00:25:21.737 --> 00:25:24.970\nRight, the add to group\noperation was successful.\n\n454\n00:25:24.970 --> 00:25:28.510\nI'll click OK, and\ngo back over to the client.\n\n455\n00:25:28.510 --> 00:25:30.020\nAnd we'll refresh this guy.\n\n456\n00:25:30.020 --> 00:25:33.830\nI might have to back out and go back, and\nlet's see if I can without refreshing.\n\n457\n00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:36.320\n&gt;&gt; So with the assumption that\nnow you added it into marketing,\n\n458\n00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:38.030\nhe should have those write permissions,\nright?\n\n459\n00:25:38.030 --> 00:25:41.450\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and I'm gonna have to\nclose this out and try that again.\n\n460\n00:25:43.350 --> 00:25:47.750\nAnd Effective Access,\nselect a User, Peter.\n\n461\n00:25:50.430 --> 00:25:52.250\nView Effective Access.\n\n462\n00:25:52.250 --> 00:25:56.880\nYeah, and unfortunately it has actually\ncached some of this information.\n\n463\n00:25:56.880 --> 00:25:58.840\nSo I need it to update.\n\n464\n00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:01.539\nAnd I'm trying to think of how\nI could get it to do that.\n\n465\n00:26:03.060 --> 00:26:03.790\nLet's just do this.\n\n466\n00:26:03.790 --> 00:26:08.130\nRather than, the problem is I just added\ninto that group in Active Directory.\n\n467\n00:26:08.130 --> 00:26:11.340\nAnd I've recently done a query\nto Active Directory, and\n\n468\n00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:15.050\nit's not updating the fact that his\ngroup membership has changed, so\n\n469\n00:26:15.050 --> 00:26:19.330\nI'm gonna manually do it right here,\ninclude group membership.\n\n470\n00:26:19.330 --> 00:26:22.900\nAll right, I think I can do this.\n\n471\n00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:24.280\nLet's look, Add items-\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n472\n00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:26.000\nspecify that he's on that marketing team.\n\n473\n00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:30.510\n&gt;&gt; Marketing, exactly, and\nthis is a great look at this tool, though.\n\n474\n00:26:30.510 --> 00:26:33.325\nThis tool, this effective\naccess to have is fantastic for\n\n475\n00:26:33.325 --> 00:26:36.420\ntroubleshooting permissions cuz I can\nmake temporary changes like this.\n\n476\n00:26:36.420 --> 00:26:37.872\nIt's not actually gonna change\nPeter's group membership-\n\n477\n00:26:37.872 --> 00:26:39.670\n&gt;&gt; Put him in that group?\n\n478\n00:26:39.670 --> 00:26:40.170\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n479\n00:26:40.170 --> 00:26:42.307\n&gt;&gt; He's already in the group.\n&gt;&gt; It's just a way to test it, hey,\n\n480\n00:26:42.307 --> 00:26:45.080\nwhat if I added him to this group and\nthings like that.\n\n481\n00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:51.300\nAll right, I'll click OK, View effective\naccess, and notice now he has write,\n\n482\n00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:54.570\nall those four write permissions,\nwhich is what we expected.\n\n483\n00:26:54.570 --> 00:26:55.630\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Right, because we added him\n\n484\n00:26:55.630 --> 00:26:56.880\nto Marketing.\n\n485\n00:26:56.880 --> 00:27:00.900\nWhat if I add him to Sales as well?\n\n486\n00:27:02.350 --> 00:27:04.770\n&gt;&gt; So this is kind of where\nthe big what if comes in, right?\n\n487\n00:27:04.770 --> 00:27:08.932\n&gt;&gt; Yes, mm-hm, and\nwe'll view effective access, and\n\n488\n00:27:08.932 --> 00:27:11.473\nnotice now he has read and write.\n\n489\n00:27:11.473 --> 00:27:13.660\nAll right,\nthis is what I wanted to show you,\n\n490\n00:27:13.660 --> 00:27:15.940\nwe talk about permissions\nbeing cumulative.\n\n491\n00:27:15.940 --> 00:27:17.761\nBelong to two different groups,\n\n492\n00:27:17.761 --> 00:27:22.195\nyour user account gets the permissions\nfrom all of the groups that you belong to.\n\n493\n00:27:22.195 --> 00:27:25.506\nAnd this is why troubleshooting\npermissions can be tricky, and\n\n494\n00:27:25.506 --> 00:27:28.420\nwhy this Effective Access tab is so\nimportant.\n\n495\n00:27:28.420 --> 00:27:31.040\nBecause I can't just go look at one group,\n\n496\n00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:34.080\nthe Edgetainers to find out\nwhat permissions Cherokee has.\n\n497\n00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:37.530\nShe might belong to dozens of other groups\nthat I don't know about, all right?\n\n498\n00:27:37.530 --> 00:27:41.270\nIn order to determine what\npermissions a user has,\n\n499\n00:27:41.270 --> 00:27:44.240\nI need to know about all\nof their group membership.\n\n500\n00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:48.940\n&gt;&gt; Because I've gotta weigh allows,\ndenies, the whole cumulative thing.\n\n501\n00:27:48.940 --> 00:27:50.520\nI've gotta add it all up.\n\n502\n00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:53.800\nThis Effective Access tab does\nthe heavy lifting for me.\n\n503\n00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:55.340\nI can simply come in here.\n\n504\n00:27:55.340 --> 00:27:58.980\nIt will go check and see what groups\nthat user belongs to, if any.\n\n505\n00:27:58.980 --> 00:28:01.180\nAnd it'll show me what\ntheir effective access is.\n\n506\n00:28:01.180 --> 00:28:03.670\nAnd it'll take everything into account,\nwhether or\n\n507\n00:28:03.670 --> 00:28:07.330\nnot there's any denies that\nmight override allows.\n\n508\n00:28:07.330 --> 00:28:10.270\nAdd up all the permissions from all\nthe different groups they belong to,\n\n509\n00:28:10.270 --> 00:28:12.110\nand it'll show me this.\n\n510\n00:28:12.110 --> 00:28:16.820\nIt doesn't tell me where they're\ngetting the permissions from.\n\n511\n00:28:16.820 --> 00:28:18.640\nAll right, it's not quite that granular.\n\n512\n00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:20.650\nIt doesn't say that you're getting read or\n\n513\n00:28:20.650 --> 00:28:23.410\nPeter's getting read because\nhe belongs to the Sales group.\n\n514\n00:28:23.410 --> 00:28:26.065\nIt doesn't give me that information, but\n\n515\n00:28:26.065 --> 00:28:29.960\nit is a way to get started in\ntrying to find that information.\n\n516\n00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:32.610\n&gt;&gt; No, it definitely helps and that's why\nit was the first thing that came to my\n\n517\n00:28:32.610 --> 00:28:36.820\nmind whenever we were coming across\nsomething, an issue there, because yeah,\n\n518\n00:28:36.820 --> 00:28:39.890\nat least we have some kind of tool like\nthat to help us sort out all this.\n\n519\n00:28:39.890 --> 00:28:44.190\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, all right, Cherokee,\nwell I think that's a pretty good look at\n\n520\n00:28:44.190 --> 00:28:46.400\nNTFS permissions\n&gt;&gt; Again,\n\n521\n00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:48.880\nthe keys to think about\nwhen you're preparing for\n\n522\n00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:52.160\nthis exam is to understand one,\nwhat the permissions give you.\n\n523\n00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:55.410\nThat's the easy part, right,\nmodify, things like that.\n\n524\n00:28:55.410 --> 00:28:59.670\nBut understand that NTFS\npermissions are controlled through\n\n525\n00:28:59.670 --> 00:29:01.990\nthe discretionary access control list.\n\n526\n00:29:01.990 --> 00:29:05.490\nWe create aces or entries so\nthat we can control access.\n\n527\n00:29:05.490 --> 00:29:08.060\nWe wanna use groups\ninstead of user accounts,\n\n528\n00:29:08.060 --> 00:29:12.898\nbecause it's a lot easier Administratively\nwe wanna think about inheritance.\n\n529\n00:29:12.898 --> 00:29:16.950\nWe always wanna try to assign the\npermission at the highest level possible,\n\n530\n00:29:16.950 --> 00:29:19.090\ncuz that means less work for us.\n\n531\n00:29:19.090 --> 00:29:22.670\nIf I can assign a permission at\na folder rather than individual files,\n\n532\n00:29:22.670 --> 00:29:25.190\nit's gonna be much easier, right?\n\n533\n00:29:25.190 --> 00:29:28.780\nLet's say there were hundreds of files\ninside a folder, and out of those hundreds\n\n534\n00:29:28.780 --> 00:29:34.100\nof files, 20 of them I wanted to give\nthe Sales group modified permissions over.\n\n535\n00:29:34.100 --> 00:29:38.076\nI would create a subfolder inside there,\nput those 20 files in that folder, and\n\n536\n00:29:38.076 --> 00:29:40.224\nthen assign the permission to that folder.\n\n537\n00:29:40.224 --> 00:29:42.010\nIt's gonna be a lot less work.\n\n538\n00:29:42.010 --> 00:29:45.660\nAlso think about the fact that\ndenies override allows, and\n\n539\n00:29:45.660 --> 00:29:47.800\nthat NTFS permissions are cumulative.\n\n540\n00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:52.320\nAnd we talked about how we can\ndetermine what permissions are explicit\n\n541\n00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:53.630\nversus inherited.\n\n542\n00:29:53.630 --> 00:29:56.155\nAnd then how to modify those\ninherited permissions.\n\n543\n00:29:56.155 --> 00:29:56.760\n&gt;&gt; My goodness.\n\n544\n00:29:56.760 --> 00:29:59.612\nI feel like you've been talking\nabout permissions for days.\n\n545\n00:29:59.612 --> 00:30:00.907\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And actually we have so.\n\n546\n00:30:00.907 --> 00:30:04.540\n[LAUGH] Thank you so much for\nall that really great information, Mike.\n\n547\n00:30:04.540 --> 00:30:05.770\nAnd thank you for joining us.\n\n548\n00:30:05.770 --> 00:30:07.250\nBut for now, let's sign out.\n\n549\n00:30:07.250 --> 00:30:08.480\nI've been your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n550\n00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:09.420\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n551\n00:30:09.420 --> 00:30:11.924\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n552\n00:30:11.924 --> 00:30:18.505\n[MUSIC]\n\n553\n00:30:18.505 -->

00:00:08.162\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.162 --> 00:00:11.765\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.765 --> 00:00:16.405\n&gt;&gt; Welcome everyone to your configure\nWindows devices series studying up for\n\n6\n00:00:16.405 --> 00:00:18.033\nthat 70-697 exam.\n\n7\n00:00:18.033 --> 00:00:19.795\nI'm your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n8\n00:00:19.795 --> 00:00:20.718\nIn this episode,\n\n9\n00:00:20.718 --> 00:00:24.417\nwe're gonna be taking a look at how\nto configure file access auditing.\n\n10\n00:00:24.417 --> 00:00:27.345\nAnd with us today,\nin studios we have Mr. Mike Rodrick.\n\n11\n00:00:27.345 --> 00:00:28.549\nHow's it going today, Mike?\n\n12\n00:00:28.549 --> 00:00:29.385\n&gt;&gt; It's going great Cherokee.\n\n13\n00:00:29.385 --> 00:00:33.275\nThanks for having me back, excited as\nalways to be here, sharing information.\n\n14\n00:00:33.275 --> 00:00:36.120\nAnd yeah, you are right,\nwe're gonna be talking about auditing and\n\n15\n00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.996\nwe're also gonna take\na look at disk quotas.\n\n16\n00:00:37.996 --> 00:00:42.866\nI gotta kinda slip this in here falls in\nbetween our previous episode with our\n\n17\n00:00:42.866 --> 00:00:47.754\nkinda NTSF permissions as well as\nauditing that we're getting ready to do.\n\n18\n00:00:47.754 --> 00:00:51.394\nSo that's where we're gonna\nstart is good old disk quotas.\n\n19\n00:00:51.394 --> 00:00:52.530\n&gt;&gt; Great, I like disk quotas.\n\n20\n00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:53.307\n&gt;&gt; Do you?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n21\n00:00:53.307 --> 00:00:55.277\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I mean does that mean that I'm\n\n22\n00:00:55.277 --> 00:00:57.033\na bit of a control freak or something?\n\n23\n00:00:57.033 --> 00:00:58.376\n&gt;&gt; I think so.\n&gt;&gt; What's that say about me as a person?\n\n24\n00:00:58.376 --> 00:00:59.184\n&gt;&gt; I think so.\n\n25\n00:00:59.184 --> 00:01:01.493\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Let's talk about what they are and\n\n26\n00:01:01.493 --> 00:01:04.231\nthen you can decide whether or\nnot Cherokee is a control freak.\n\n27\n00:01:04.231 --> 00:01:05.087\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n[LAUGH]\n\n28\n00:01:05.087 --> 00:01:05.899\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n29\n00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:10.369\ndisk quota is we understand that we only\nhave so much space available on our hard\n\n30\n00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:14.379\ndrives and that we have to kinda\ncontrol how much we are storing there.\n\n31\n00:01:14.379 --> 00:01:17.922\nAnd I guess a better way to put\nit would be, this is my laptop,\n\n32\n00:01:17.922 --> 00:01:21.339\nI get all the space,\nit's all mine, it doesn't matter.\n\n33\n00:01:21.339 --> 00:01:25.710\nBut in a shared computer environment\nwhere more one person might be using that\n\n34\n00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:26.389\ncomputer.\n\n35\n00:01:26.389 --> 00:01:31.089\nOr up on file servers, where were\nallowing our users to store data,\n\n36\n00:01:31.089 --> 00:01:36.126\nwe might wanna control how much\nspace they're actually using, right?\n\n37\n00:01:36.126 --> 00:01:39.884\nBecause we do have a finite\namount of space, we have to plan,\n\n38\n00:01:39.884 --> 00:01:42.699\nwe have to buy additional\nspace as we run low.\n\n39\n00:01:42.699 --> 00:01:48.332\nAnd this is just a way that I can help\ncontrol how much each user is allocated or\n\n40\n00:01:48.332 --> 00:01:49.574\nallowed to use.\n\n41\n00:01:49.574 --> 00:01:52.652\nBecause let's say we have\nan office of 100 people.\n\n42\n00:01:52.652 --> 00:01:57.095\nI don't want one or\ntwo people using 90% of the storage space.\n\n43\n00:01:57.095 --> 00:01:59.100\nOne, it's not fair to everybody else.\n\n44\n00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.991\nEverybody needs a little bit of\nslice of that storage up there.\n\n45\n00:02:01.991 --> 00:02:04.154\nSo wanna make sure that\neverybody has room.\n\n46\n00:02:04.154 --> 00:02:08.787\nAnd I don't want somebody maybe storing\ntheir entire MP3 correction up there,\n\n47\n00:02:08.787 --> 00:02:13.434\ntaking up again all that space with stuff\nthat should be there in the first place.\n\n48\n00:02:13.434 --> 00:02:17.096\nWe're taking about how we can\ncontrol that, a little bit later.\n\n49\n00:02:17.096 --> 00:02:21.816\nBut that's what disk quotas do,\ndisk quotas allows me to set a quota, and\n\n50\n00:02:21.816 --> 00:02:25.150\nsay each user is allowed\n1 gigabyte of space.\n\n51\n00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.291\nAnd then Windows can do it\na couple of different ways.\n\n52\n00:02:27.291 --> 00:02:31.421\nWe can either just audit that space\nusage and we can give messages or\n\n53\n00:02:31.421 --> 00:02:32.390\nwe can stop it.\n\n54\n00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.414\nWe can say when a user\ngets to a certain point,\n\n55\n00:02:34.414 --> 00:02:36.399\nthey're not allowed to save any more data.\n\n56\n00:02:36.399 --> 00:02:38.987\nThey're gonna have to go and\nremove something or\n\n57\n00:02:38.987 --> 00:02:42.091\nfree some space up before they\ncan save additional files.\n\n58\n00:02:42.091 --> 00:02:47.215\nSo that's what disk quotas is all\nabout as far as a high level overview.\n\n59\n00:02:47.215 --> 00:02:50.796\nLet's talk a little bit about\nthe details of disk quotas.\n\n60\n00:02:50.796 --> 00:02:53.760\nOne, it's a part of the NTSF file system.\n\n61\n00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.887\nSo it's available on any partition\nthat's formatted with NTFS.\n\n62\n00:02:57.887 --> 00:03:02.928\nIt is done on a per volume basis,\nnot a per disk basis.\n\n63\n00:03:02.928 --> 00:03:07.776\nSo if you have a single physical disk or\na raid array with several volumes or\n\n64\n00:03:07.776 --> 00:03:12.718\npartitions on there, the quotas are gonna\nbe set on a per partition basis.\n\n65\n00:03:12.718 --> 00:03:17.118\nSo D:, E:, it doesnt matter if\nits on the same physical disk or\n\n66\n00:03:17.118 --> 00:03:19.901\nacross multiple disks or what have you.\n\n67\n00:03:19.901 --> 00:03:21.930\nSo it was done in a per volume basis.\n\n68\n00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.703\nWe can configure it right on\nthe properties of the drive or\n\n69\n00:03:26.703 --> 00:03:33.074\nwe can use group policy to configure\ndisk quotas, which we might look at it.\n\n70\n00:03:33.074 --> 00:03:36.650\nREFS does not support REFS\nas my resilient file system,\n\n71\n00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.934\nwhich was supposed to be\nthe replacement for NTFS.\n\n72\n00:03:39.934 --> 00:03:42.768\nIt seems to have slowed down a little bit,\nbut\n\n73\n00:03:42.768 --> 00:03:45.762\njust understand that this\nis a feature of NTFS.\n\n74\n00:03:45.762 --> 00:03:50.259\nAnd REFS is not going to support or\nat least at the time of this recording,\n\n75\n00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:52.709\nREFS is not gonna support disk quotas.\n\n76\n00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:56.160\n&gt;&gt; Right, I mean even when we looked at\nsome of the other features that you had\n\n77\n00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.845\nshowed us when we were talking about\nencryption and compression and so forth.\n\n78\n00:03:59.845 --> 00:04:03.616\nI think like you said, at the time\nof this show, when we look at REFS,\n\n79\n00:04:03.616 --> 00:04:08.065\nwe don't have all of those abilities and\nto be able to boot with that file system.\n\n80\n00:04:08.065 --> 00:04:11.400\nBut I think in the future that may be the\nway that Microsoft is heading, who knows?\n\n81\n00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:12.318\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, who knows, right?\n\n82\n00:04:12.318 --> 00:04:15.935\nAnd something like disk quotas might\nnever come back because we have\n\n83\n00:04:15.935 --> 00:04:19.308\nother things that can manage this\nis a much more efficient way.\n\n84\n00:04:19.308 --> 00:04:22.722\nDisk quotas have been around for\na long time, since NTFS or\n\n85\n00:04:22.722 --> 00:04:25.850\nright around the time\nthey came out with NTFS.\n\n86\n00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:30.050\nSo there are some things I'm gonna talk\nabout, some limitations to disk quotas.\n\n87\n00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:32.390\nWe have file server resource manager, and\n\n88\n00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:35.965\nthings like that on the server end\nthat give me much more control,\n\n89\n00:04:35.965 --> 00:04:39.217\nmuch more reporting capabilities,\na lot better options.\n\n90\n00:04:39.217 --> 00:04:43.261\nBut disk quotas are still around and\nthey're very useful in like I said,\n\n91\n00:04:43.261 --> 00:04:46.258\nsmall environments where\nwe have shared computing.\n\n92\n00:04:46.258 --> 00:04:51.061\nAnd we need to make sure that everybody's\nallocated a certain amount of space,\n\n93\n00:04:51.061 --> 00:04:51.570\nright?\n\n94\n00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:54.543\nSo let's take a look at how\nwe can configure disk quotas.\n\n95\n00:04:54.543 --> 00:04:58.980\nAnd I'll talk along the way about some\nof the features we need to be aware of.\n\n96\n00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:02.589\nSo I'm on a Windows 10\nEnterprise edition here.\n\n97\n00:05:02.589 --> 00:05:04.928\nAnd this is again,\nit's a property of of NTFS, so\n\n98\n00:05:04.928 --> 00:05:08.400\nit's not like it's only available on\nEnterprise or anything like that.\n\n99\n00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.697\nIt's a property of the NTFS file system.\n\n100\n00:05:10.697 --> 00:05:13.350\nAnd I'm gonna open up File Explorer.\n\n101\n00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:16.479\nAnd I'm simply going to either way you\nwanna go, if you wanna go to this PC.\n\n102\n00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:20.995\nBut you really just need the properties\nof one of your drives that you want to\n\n103\n00:05:20.995 --> 00:05:22.651\nimplement disk quotas on.\n\n104\n00:05:22.651 --> 00:05:26.951\nI'm gonna do E:, so\nI've got a separate disk in here.\n\n105\n00:05:26.951 --> 00:05:29.671\nAnd I wanna implement quotas on that.\n\n106\n00:05:29.671 --> 00:05:35.649\nSo I'm gonna right click on local disk E,\nand choose Properties.\n\n107\n00:05:35.649 --> 00:05:42.293\nAnd that Properties pane, I'm going to go\nto the, I'll zoom in here, the Quota tab.\n\n108\n00:05:42.293 --> 00:05:43.077\nConvenient, right?\n\n109\n00:05:43.077 --> 00:05:45.379\nThey put disk quotas on\nit's own tab called Quota.\n\n110\n00:05:45.379 --> 00:05:48.351\nSo it's easy to find and\nwhen you first come in here,\n\n111\n00:05:48.351 --> 00:05:51.267\nyou'll see it tells you\na little bit about quotas.\n\n112\n00:05:51.267 --> 00:05:54.587\nYou can't see it right away,\nyou have to have administrative access.\n\n113\n00:05:54.587 --> 00:05:57.040\nIt's what that little\nshield is telling me.\n\n114\n00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:01.865\nSo I'm gonna show quota settings and that\nis going to open up my quota settings.\n\n115\n00:06:01.865 --> 00:06:05.102\nIt's turned off by default,\nit's not enabled.\n\n116\n00:06:05.102 --> 00:06:08.195\nIt's something we have to come in and\nturn on if we want to use it.\n\n117\n00:06:08.195 --> 00:06:12.896\nSo it's simply a check mark right up\nhere at the top Enable quota management.\n\n118\n00:06:12.896 --> 00:06:17.090\nAnd you'll see everything else\nlights up underneath that, right?\n\n119\n00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:21.170\nAnd with it turned on, with the rest\nof these features now available,\n\n120\n00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:25.195\nI can see things like deny disk space\nto users exceeding quota limit.\n\n121\n00:06:25.195 --> 00:06:27.810\nAnd you might think well, wait a second,\n\n122\n00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:32.085\nif we're turning on quotas why\nwouldn't I want to deny disk space?\n\n123\n00:06:32.085 --> 00:06:33.661\nAnd you might be auditing,\n\n124\n00:06:33.661 --> 00:06:37.919\nyou might be trying to see well how\nmuch each user is using approximately?\n\n125\n00:06:37.919 --> 00:06:41.377\nWhat is the high end users,\nthe ones that use the most space.\n\n126\n00:06:41.377 --> 00:06:43.510\nHow much space are they using?\n\n127\n00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:47.036\nBecause I'm trying to plan,\nI'm trying to plan out future capacity,\n\n128\n00:06:47.036 --> 00:06:48.347\nstorage capacity needs.\n\n129\n00:06:48.347 --> 00:06:53.036\nSo maybe I just want to audit,\nbut not actually limit.\n\n130\n00:06:53.036 --> 00:06:54.571\nWithout checking this,\n\n131\n00:06:54.571 --> 00:06:59.107\nit won't prevent anybody from going\nbeyond their quota that we've set.\n\n132\n00:06:59.107 --> 00:07:01.564\nLet me go ahead and\nturn it on, I'm gonna say,\n\n133\n00:07:01.564 --> 00:07:04.342\nDeny disk space to users\nexceeding the quota limit.\n\n134\n00:07:04.342 --> 00:07:08.346\nAnd then the default quota limit for\nnew users on this volume.\n\n135\n00:07:08.346 --> 00:07:13.385\nI can choose to either Do not limit\nthis usage or Limit disk space to.\n\n136\n00:07:13.385 --> 00:07:17.720\nAnd I've got two options here\nI've got one, the limit.\n\n137\n00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:19.751\nThis is how much space\nI'm going to give them.\n\n138\n00:07:19.751 --> 00:07:25.267\n1 kilobyte, megabyte, you can see I can\nuse any of them, petabytes, exabytes.\n\n139\n00:07:25.267 --> 00:07:28.139\n&gt;&gt; Wow,\n[LAUGH] I wish I had a disk that large.\n\n140\n00:07:28.139 --> 00:07:30.336\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I know that's\nwhat I was just thinking.\n\n141\n00:07:30.336 --> 00:07:32.964\nIf I wanna set your quota at 2 exabytes.\n\n142\n00:07:32.964 --> 00:07:34.180\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right?\n\n143\n00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:37.664\n&gt;&gt; Okay, more reasonable might\nbe something in gigabytes,\n\n144\n00:07:37.664 --> 00:07:42.440\nsince todays typical hard drives that we\nfind in our client operating systems.\n\n145\n00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:45.812\nSo I can set this to 1\ngigabyte what have you, for\n\n146\n00:07:45.812 --> 00:07:49.944\ndemonstration purposes,\nI'm gonna set it really small.\n\n147\n00:07:49.944 --> 00:07:53.600\nI'm gonna say something like\nI don't know 5 kilobytes.\n\n148\n00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:59.331\nActually I'll set that to, Yeah,\nwe'll do 10 kilobytes, all right?\n\n149\n00:07:59.331 --> 00:08:02.684\nAnd then I've got my warning level set to,\nall right?\n\n150\n00:08:02.684 --> 00:08:04.793\nAnd I can set this to maybe 5 kilobytes.\n\n151\n00:08:04.793 --> 00:08:07.988\nAgain, these numbers don't make\na lot of sense in the real world.\n\n152\n00:08:07.988 --> 00:08:10.272\nYou'd wanna give them a little\nmore space than that so\n\n153\n00:08:10.272 --> 00:08:12.209\nthey could save more\nthan one text document.\n\n154\n00:08:12.209 --> 00:08:15.775\n&gt;&gt; Otherwise you're gonna have a headache\nwith all the support calls that you'll\n\n155\n00:08:15.775 --> 00:08:16.366\nbe getting.\n\n156\n00:08:16.366 --> 00:08:18.041\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.\n\n157\n00:08:18.041 --> 00:08:20.664\nBut for the exam understand\nthat one is the limit and\n\n158\n00:08:20.664 --> 00:08:22.190\nthe other one is the warning.\n\n159\n00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:25.723\nNow here is one of the first\nissues we have with these quotas.\n\n160\n00:08:25.723 --> 00:08:30.115\nThat warning that we are setting up here,\ngoes into the event viewer, or\n\n161\n00:08:30.115 --> 00:08:34.580\ninto our event log system, which my users,\nwho are not administrators,\n\n162\n00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:36.610\ntypically do not have access to.\n\n163\n00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:39.515\nSo this is not something\nthat they're gonna see.\n\n164\n00:08:39.515 --> 00:08:44.135\nLike, hey,\nyou're at 80% of your quota usage.\n\n165\n00:08:44.135 --> 00:08:45.550\nThey would have to have\naccess to the Event Viewer.\n\n166\n00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:49.430\nSo this is more for your administrators.\n\n167\n00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:52.434\nAnd then right below that,\nset the quota logging options.\n\n168\n00:08:52.434 --> 00:08:55.389\nLog event when a user\nexceeds their quota limit, or\n\n169\n00:08:55.389 --> 00:08:58.492\nlog an event when a user\nexceeds their warning level.\n\n170\n00:08:58.492 --> 00:09:02.700\nSo we want, I'm going to go ahead and\nturn both of those on and\n\n171\n00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:05.518\nset those logging entries, all right?\n\n172\n00:09:05.518 --> 00:09:07.946\nSo, so far pretty straightforward.\n\n173\n00:09:07.946 --> 00:09:11.368\nAll right, let me zoom back out so\nI can see this.\n\n174\n00:09:11.368 --> 00:09:13.994\nI also have a button for quota entries.\n\n175\n00:09:13.994 --> 00:09:17.440\nLet me go ahead apply my changes so far.\n\n176\n00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:20.657\nAnd it tells me you should enable the\nquota system, and I'll zoom into that for\n\n177\n00:09:20.657 --> 00:09:22.915\nyou, only if you intend to\nuse quotas on disk volumes.\n\n178\n00:09:22.915 --> 00:09:27.918\nIt does add a little bit of overhead to\nthe overall process of writing files,\n\n179\n00:09:27.918 --> 00:09:30.278\nnot much, it's very negligible.\n\n180\n00:09:30.278 --> 00:09:32.225\nBut when you enable quota system,\n\n181\n00:09:32.225 --> 00:09:35.933\nthe volume will be re-scanned\nto update disk usage statistics.\n\n182\n00:09:35.933 --> 00:09:37.794\nThis might take several minutes, and\n\n183\n00:09:37.794 --> 00:09:41.865\nthat's definitely something you might\nnotice if it's a volume that's in use that\n\n184\n00:09:41.865 --> 00:09:44.092\na lot of people have\nalready stored files on.\n\n185\n00:09:44.092 --> 00:09:46.522\nAnd we go and we turn on quotas.\n\n186\n00:09:46.522 --> 00:09:49.380\nQuotas are based on\nthe owners of the file.\n\n187\n00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:53.675\nSo what Windows has to do now is scan all\nthose files that exist on that volume,\n\n188\n00:09:53.675 --> 00:09:56.583\ndetermine who the owner is and\nstart tallying it up,\n\n189\n00:09:56.583 --> 00:09:59.974\nso that it can keep track of how\nmuch space each user has used.\n\n190\n00:09:59.974 --> 00:10:04.915\nAnd that process can slow the system\ndown as it's doing that initial scan.\n\n191\n00:10:04.915 --> 00:10:09.349\nOnce that initial scan occurs,\nthe overhead is really not noticeable.\n\n192\n00:10:09.349 --> 00:10:15.079\nSo we'll go ahead and\nclick OK to enable disk quotas.\n\n193\n00:10:15.079 --> 00:10:17.448\nAnd I have to go ahead and set that on.\n\n194\n00:10:17.448 --> 00:10:23.570\nAll right, now, when I do this as I said,\nthe default quota limit for\n\n195\n00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:28.226\nnew users has now been set\nto 10 kilobytes in size.\n\n196\n00:10:28.226 --> 00:10:35.396\nAll right, if we click on Quota Entries,\nand wow, a lot things in here, let's see.\n\n197\n00:10:35.396 --> 00:10:37.524\nSo it's still kinda going\nthrough there guys,\n\n198\n00:10:37.524 --> 00:10:40.300\nit's starting to refresh you can\nsee it building up its data.\n\n199\n00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:44.111\nSo these are users accounts\nthat exist on this machine, and\n\n200\n00:10:44.111 --> 00:10:47.708\nit's starting to show me how\nmuch space they have used.\n\n201\n00:10:47.708 --> 00:10:52.643\nAnd I can see I am well over the limit,\nall right?\n\n202\n00:10:52.643 --> 00:10:59.058\nBut notice what it says here,\nquotas No limit, no limit, all right?\n\n203\n00:11:01.619 --> 00:11:06.270\nAnd let's take a look at,\nwhere are we going next?\n\n204\n00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:09.521\nYeah, now these user\naccounts existed before, or\n\n205\n00:11:09.521 --> 00:11:12.632\nhad already signed on\nbefore I had set the quota.\n\n206\n00:11:12.632 --> 00:11:15.095\nSo I'm seeing that the quota\nis not being applied to them.\n\n207\n00:11:15.095 --> 00:11:19.611\nRemember in the dialogue box for\nquota settings this is\n\n208\n00:11:19.611 --> 00:11:24.731\nthe default quota limit for\nnew users on this volume, right?\n\n209\n00:11:24.731 --> 00:11:27.576\nSo what I'm gonna do is I'm simply gonna\ngo in here and I'm gonna turn this on for\n\n210\n00:11:27.576 --> 00:11:28.811\na couple of these existing users.\n\n211\n00:11:28.811 --> 00:11:32.866\nI'm gonna right-click on User Account,\nProperties, and then I'm gonna choose,\n\n212\n00:11:32.866 --> 00:11:34.741\nnotice it says Do not limit disk usage.\n\n213\n00:11:34.741 --> 00:11:38.856\nI'm gonna say Limit, and click OK.\n\n214\n00:11:38.856 --> 00:11:40.219\nAnd let me find one more.\n\n215\n00:11:40.219 --> 00:11:45.302\nLet's do Cherokee's here, we'll use\nthese as our samples or our trials here.\n\n216\n00:11:45.302 --> 00:11:48.143\nSo I'll turn that on for them as well.\n\n217\n00:11:48.143 --> 00:11:51.949\nAll right, so\nnow I can see a couple of things here.\n\n218\n00:11:51.949 --> 00:11:56.620\nI can see what their current use is,\nwhat their quota limit is and\n\n219\n00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:58.793\nwhat their warning is set to.\n\n220\n00:11:58.793 --> 00:12:01.272\nSomething else we need to be aware of or\n\n221\n00:12:01.272 --> 00:12:05.611\nwe need to be familiar of is that\nadministrators get a free pass, so\n\n222\n00:12:05.611 --> 00:12:09.593\nanybody in the Local Admins group-\n&gt;&gt; Excluded from these rules?\n\n223\n00:12:09.593 --> 00:12:11.003\n&gt;&gt; Are excluded from them, exactly.\n\n224\n00:12:11.003 --> 00:12:11.928\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n\n225\n00:12:11.928 --> 00:12:15.500\n&gt;&gt; Excluded from\nthe quotas that we set up.\n\n226\n00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:19.302\nAll right, so\nlet's see if we can test this out.\n\n227\n00:12:19.302 --> 00:12:22.643\nI'm going to switch to\nanother user account.\n\n228\n00:12:24.471 --> 00:12:28.837\nAnd we'll do Aubrey,\nsince that's one that I turned us on for.\n\n229\n00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:41.019\nAnd I am going to create a new file.\n\n230\n00:12:41.019 --> 00:12:44.584\nAnd we saw that Aubrey's quota usage\nwas somewhere around 2 kilobytes.\n\n231\n00:12:44.584 --> 00:12:47.992\nWe set the warning at 5 kilobytes, so\nwhat I'm gonna do is I'm gonna open up\n\n232\n00:12:47.992 --> 00:12:51.531\nan administrative, don't know if I\nneed an administrative command prompt.\n\n233\n00:12:51.531 --> 00:12:55.450\nLet's just do a command prompt.\n\n234\n00:12:55.450 --> 00:12:56.876\nAnd I'm gonna kinda cheat.\n\n235\n00:12:56.876 --> 00:12:57.453\nLet me bump this up.\n\n236\n00:12:57.453 --> 00:13:02.054\nThis is not something that will be\non the test, it's just a way that\n\n237\n00:13:02.054 --> 00:13:05.645\nI'm going to demonstrate the-\n&gt;&gt; Usage of her storage.\n\n238\n00:13:05.645 --> 00:13:08.528\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the disquotas.\n\n239\n00:13:08.528 --> 00:13:13.727\nI need to make a file, or some files,\nthat will trigger this quota system.\n\n240\n00:13:13.727 --> 00:13:18.905\nSo I'm gonna be using FSUTIL\nto create a new file.\n\n241\n00:13:18.905 --> 00:13:21.025\nThat didn't bump my font size up at all,\ndid it?\n\n242\n00:13:21.025 --> 00:13:22.356\nLet's try that one more time.\n\n243\n00:13:27.921 --> 00:13:28.717\nThere we go.\n\n244\n00:13:28.717 --> 00:13:30.730\nNow hopefully you can see\nthat a little bit better.\n\n245\n00:13:30.730 --> 00:13:36.648\nBut FSUTILfilecreatenew,\nwhich is all one word.\n\n246\n00:13:36.648 --> 00:13:40.744\nAnd I'm gonna make this on e:,\nand I'm gonna call it,\n\n247\n00:13:44.032 --> 00:13:47.886\naubrifile01.txt.\n\n248\n00:13:47.886 --> 00:13:50.726\nAnd then I'm gonna set this to, let's see,\n\n249\n00:13:50.726 --> 00:13:53.429\nI set that to five\nkilobytes was the warning.\n\n250\n00:13:53.429 --> 00:13:56.501\nShe's already used two, so\n\n251\n00:13:56.501 --> 00:14:01.241\nlet's do another five kilobytes, right?\n\n252\n00:14:01.241 --> 00:14:06.439\nShould be right around there,\nright, is that kilobytes?\n\n253\n00:14:06.439 --> 00:14:07.911\n&gt;&gt; I don't remember\nthe units of mesurements\n\n254\n00:14:07.911 --> 00:14:08.953\n&gt;&gt; Yeah bytes, kilobytes.\n\n255\n00:14:08.953 --> 00:14:10.983\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But we're gonna find out.\n\n256\n00:14:10.983 --> 00:14:16.569\n&gt;&gt; All right, let's go in here and\nsay if we take a look at that file.\n\n257\n00:14:16.569 --> 00:14:19.792\nThere, I can see it is\n5 kilobytes in size.\n\n258\n00:14:19.792 --> 00:14:22.425\nBut notice she didn't get\nany kind of warning, right?\n\n259\n00:14:22.425 --> 00:14:26.082\nNothing says that hey,\nyou're at your limit.\n\n260\n00:14:26.082 --> 00:14:30.797\nIf I try to create another\nfile that's also 5\n\n261\n00:14:30.797 --> 00:14:35.644\nkilobytes in size, let's see what happens.\n\n262\n00:14:35.644 --> 00:14:37.940\nAnd there we go, if I can zoom into that,\n\n263\n00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:41.669\nno I can't zoom you'll see there\nis not enough space on the disk.\n\n264\n00:14:41.669 --> 00:14:43.667\nSo she's reached that limit, right?\n\n265\n00:14:43.667 --> 00:14:46.002\nDisk quotas is saying\nyou can't create this.\n\n266\n00:14:46.002 --> 00:14:47.823\nYou are out of space.\n\n267\n00:14:47.823 --> 00:14:52.378\nAnd this is another issue that I kinda\nhave with disk quotas is it's not very\n\n268\n00:14:52.378 --> 00:14:55.140\nclear the message that\nit gives the end user.\n\n269\n00:14:55.140 --> 00:14:56.989\nThere's not enough space on the disk.\n\n270\n00:14:56.989 --> 00:14:58.899\nSo an end user, they're gonna see this and\n\n271\n00:14:58.899 --> 00:15:01.353\nthe first thing they're gonna\ndo is pick up the phone.\n\n272\n00:15:01.353 --> 00:15:02.607\n&gt;&gt; Something's wrong with my hard drive.\n\n273\n00:15:02.607 --> 00:15:04.303\n&gt;&gt; And call the help desk, exactly.\n\n274\n00:15:04.303 --> 00:15:05.855\nAnd they're gonna say, something's wrong.\n\n275\n00:15:05.855 --> 00:15:08.081\nI'm out of disk space, what has happened?\n\n276\n00:15:08.081 --> 00:15:11.413\nOr they're gonna call and\ntell you the server is out of disk space.\n\n277\n00:15:11.413 --> 00:15:16.539\nIt doesn't say Your quota is preventing\nyou from saving anymore, right?\n\n278\n00:15:16.539 --> 00:15:21.549\nAnd so that's kind of an issue that\nwe have as admins with disk quotas.\n\n279\n00:15:21.549 --> 00:15:23.470\nIt's not real clear on that.\n\n280\n00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:25.219\nAnd like I said, no pop up, right?\n\n281\n00:15:25.219 --> 00:15:25.961\nThey didn't get a message.\n\n282\n00:15:25.961 --> 00:15:30.070\nRemember we said to set\na warning to 5 kilobytes?\n\n283\n00:15:30.070 --> 00:15:31.451\nWhere is that warning?\n\n284\n00:15:31.451 --> 00:15:33.528\nWell, that went into my event log system.\n\n285\n00:15:33.528 --> 00:15:36.841\nSo, not something the end user sees.\n\n286\n00:15:36.841 --> 00:15:40.645\n&gt;&gt; I see a comment in the chat\nwhere it says disk quotas are evil.\n\n287\n00:15:40.645 --> 00:15:41.535\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n288\n00:15:41.535 --> 00:15:46.469\nthat's not really the evil part because\nyou've mentioned FSRM for file server-\n\n289\n00:15:46.469 --> 00:15:47.053\n&gt;&gt; Resource manager.\n\n290\n00:15:47.053 --> 00:15:47.994\n&gt;&gt; Resource manager, yeah.\n\n291\n00:15:47.994 --> 00:15:51.407\nAnd that's where things could potentially\nget evil because you can create those\n\n292\n00:15:51.407 --> 00:15:52.775\ncustomized messages, right?\n\n293\n00:15:52.775 --> 00:15:57.448\nSo you could be like Mike will not allow\nyou to save anymore files, muahaha.\n\n294\n00:15:57.448 --> 00:15:57.984\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.\n\n295\n00:15:57.984 --> 00:16:01.225\nWe can have a lot of, FSRM is so\nmuch more customizable, so\n\n296\n00:16:01.225 --> 00:16:05.412\nmuch more powerful With file screening and\nthings like that that we can do.\n\n297\n00:16:05.412 --> 00:16:10.340\nBut disk quotas was way back when,\nbefore we had things like that.\n\n298\n00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:16.050\nSo at the time it was a useful\nway to control utilization\n\n299\n00:16:16.050 --> 00:16:19.720\nof our hard drive space, especially when\nhard drive space was extremely expensive.\n\n300\n00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:24.630\nIt's a lot cheaper nowadays to go out and\nbuy terabyte mechanical drives\n\n301\n00:16:24.630 --> 00:16:28.270\nthan it was five years ago,\neight years ago, things like that.\n\n302\n00:16:28.270 --> 00:16:32.430\nSo these definitely had their place,\nbut there are some issues.\n\n303\n00:16:32.430 --> 00:16:33.670\nAnd let's just go over those.\n\n304\n00:16:33.670 --> 00:16:37.800\nSo for the exam, they're not gonna hit you\ntoo hard, I don't think, on disk quotas,\n\n305\n00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:42.600\nbecause it is an older thing that we have\nother things that can be used nowadays.\n\n306\n00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:46.800\nBut things you should be aware of,\nthat it's part of the NTFS file system.\n\n307\n00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:48.830\nYou can see it's done on a per user basis.\n\n308\n00:16:48.830 --> 00:16:51.770\nIt's done on a per volume basis.\n\n309\n00:16:51.770 --> 00:16:53.300\nWhat else do you wanna know about this?\n\n310\n00:16:55.270 --> 00:16:58.540\nThe warnings are only showing\nup in the event log system so\n\n311\n00:16:58.540 --> 00:17:04.150\nI've gotta monitor that, or in the event\nlog system I've gotta set up some triggers\n\n312\n00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:08.750\nto where when I see that particular\nevent maybe I get a notification.\n\n313\n00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:13.700\nThe other thing I mentioned earlier\nis it's based on owner of the file.\n\n314\n00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:16.365\nAnd it's not based on\nany particular folder.\n\n315\n00:17:16.365 --> 00:17:19.930\nWhereas with the newer\ntechnologies like FSRM, I can say,\n\n316\n00:17:19.930 --> 00:17:23.620\nyou get five gigabytes of space\nin this particular directory.\n\n317\n00:17:23.620 --> 00:17:25.790\nIn this other directory\nof the same volume,\n\n318\n00:17:25.790 --> 00:17:26.980\nyou might get ten gigabytes, right?\n\n319\n00:17:26.980 --> 00:17:28.630\nWe have a lot more control.\n\n320\n00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:32.100\nWith this, notice it was done on\nthe properties of the volume itself.\n\n321\n00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:34.230\nSo it doesn't matter what\nfolder you put it in.\n\n322\n00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:36.790\nAnd this is where you see some confusion,\nis people will create.\n\n323\n00:17:36.790 --> 00:17:40.730\nLet's say I have a drive that has\na folder for each user, right?\n\n324\n00:17:40.730 --> 00:17:42.520\nAnd Aubrey is at her limit.\n\n325\n00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:45.740\nSo she takes a file and moves it out\nof her folder and says, hey, Cherokee,\n\n326\n00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:48.730\ncan I dump this in your folder so\nthat I can free up some space?\n\n327\n00:17:48.730 --> 00:17:51.410\nAnd so\nshe moves a file into Cherokee's folder.\n\n328\n00:17:51.410 --> 00:17:53.169\nWell, the owner of the file didn't change.\n\n329\n00:17:53.169 --> 00:17:57.529\nSo it doesn't matter where it's located or\nif it's in a folder called Cherokee it's\n\n330\n00:17:57.529 --> 00:18:01.380\nstill being charged to Aubury's\naccount because she is the owner.\n\n331\n00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:04.940\nSo the only way to free up space against\nyour quota, if you're running short and\n\n332\n00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:09.940\nyou need to save something like Aubrey is\nnow would be to delete something, right,\n\n333\n00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:13.095\nwhich typically is not possible unless\nyou have a lot of stuff that you don't\n\n334\n00:18:13.095 --> 00:18:13.770\nuse any more.\n\n335\n00:18:13.770 --> 00:18:17.240\nYou could free up space that way,\nor change ownership.\n\n336\n00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:20.470\nIf I could get Cherokee to take\nownership of some of my files,\n\n337\n00:18:20.470 --> 00:18:24.050\nnow they'd be charged against\nCherokee's account, and not Aubrey's.\n\n338\n00:18:24.050 --> 00:18:26.070\nAnd then she could save\na little more data.\n\n339\n00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:26.990\n&gt;&gt; But that's gonna cost ya.\n\n340\n00:18:26.990 --> 00:18:27.700\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n341\n00:18:27.700 --> 00:18:28.982\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Cherokee's gonna charge me, right?\n\n342\n00:18:28.982 --> 00:18:30.697\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's gonna be at least two\n\n343\n00:18:30.697 --> 00:18:32.157\nStarbucks trips or something like that.\n\n344\n00:18:32.157 --> 00:18:33.971\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n345\n00:18:33.971 --> 00:18:38.655\n&gt;&gt; Other things about disk quotas is\nit's based on the uncompressed size.\n\n346\n00:18:38.655 --> 00:18:42.530\nSo you can't even gain space\nby compressing files, right?\n\n347\n00:18:43.670 --> 00:18:45.830\nThe disk quota ignores that and\n\n348\n00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:49.380\nit looks at the actual file\nsize in its uncompressed state.\n\n349\n00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:52.870\nSo you get users thinking hey,\nI'll compress a bunch of files.\n\n350\n00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:54.740\nThat way I can free up some space.\n\n351\n00:18:54.740 --> 00:18:56.740\nIt doesn't work, all right?\n\n352\n00:18:56.740 --> 00:19:02.520\nYou're gonna have to delete them in\norder to be, or again, change ownership.\n\n353\n00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:06.700\nAll right, and\nthat is probably good for disk quota.\n\n354\n00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:11.470\nLike I said, it'll probably not\nbe a huge part of the exam, but\n\n355\n00:19:11.470 --> 00:19:15.020\nunderstand that they're there and\nwhat we can do with them.\n\n356\n00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:19.010\n&gt;&gt; All right, what kind of other auditing\ntopics do we have to look at here?\n\n357\n00:19:19.010 --> 00:19:24.570\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that is our next topic is we're\ngonna talk about file access auditing.\n\n358\n00:19:24.570 --> 00:19:29.430\nAuditing is the tracking of whatever,\nI guess.\n\n359\n00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:33.210\nIn our case, file access,\nwe're gonna be auditing access to files.\n\n360\n00:19:33.210 --> 00:19:36.230\nAnd this is a very important\npart of what we do.\n\n361\n00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:39.540\nWe need to know when somebody\naccesses a particular resource.\n\n362\n00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:43.185\nWith today's regulations, HIPAA,\nthings like that, industry,\n\n363\n00:19:43.185 --> 00:19:45.820\ngovernmental regulations,\nwhatever the case may be,\n\n364\n00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:49.050\nit's very important that we\ncan track access to objects.\n\n365\n00:19:49.050 --> 00:19:52.740\nAnd that's where auditing comes into play,\nall right?\n\n366\n00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:55.890\nSo we do need to understand\nhow to configure that.\n\n367\n00:19:55.890 --> 00:19:58.070\nI'm gonna do it on\nthe server side of things.\n\n368\n00:19:58.070 --> 00:20:01.690\nIt's one of those topics that I guess\n\n369\n00:20:03.020 --> 00:20:06.630\nit goes to both the server and\nthe client side of things.\n\n370\n00:20:06.630 --> 00:20:10.667\nSo what I'm gonna do is I'm over\non my domain controller and\n\n371\n00:20:10.667 --> 00:20:13.751\nI'm gonna open up Group Policy Management.\n\n372\n00:20:13.751 --> 00:20:16.441\nWhen we talk about configuring\nauditing we're gonna\n\n373\n00:20:16.441 --> 00:20:19.248\ntypically be using group\npolicy to set up the auditing,\n\n374\n00:20:19.248 --> 00:20:22.500\nand there's several different\ncategories that we can audit.\n\n375\n00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:26.580\nThey wanna focus here on\nfile access auditing.\n\n376\n00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:29.400\nBut just in case they deviate\nfrom that on the exam,\n\n377\n00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:32.730\nI thought we'd take\na look at more than that.\n\n378\n00:20:32.730 --> 00:20:38.260\nSo I'm gonna right-click\non one of my policies and\n\n379\n00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:42.633\nour auditing settings are gonna be under\n\n380\n00:20:42.633 --> 00:20:48.806\nComputer Configuration &gt;\nPolicies &gt; Windows Settings\n\n381\n00:20:48.806 --> 00:20:54.993\n&gt; Security Settings &gt;\nLocal Policies &gt; Audit Policy.\n\n382\n00:20:54.993 --> 00:20:57.832\nAll right, this is one of the sections,\nwe'll talk about a couple of them.\n\n383\n00:20:57.832 --> 00:20:59.900\nThis is the old school audit policy.\n\n384\n00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:04.090\nThese are the settings that we've\nhad since as long as I can remember.\n\n385\n00:21:04.090 --> 00:21:07.130\nYou can see when I click on\nAuto Policy there on the left,\n\n386\n00:21:07.130 --> 00:21:11.040\non the right-hand side I see the different\ncategories that I can enable auditing.\n\n387\n00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:13.810\nAccount logon events, account management,\n\n388\n00:21:13.810 --> 00:21:17.710\ndirectory service access,\nlogon events, object access,\n\n389\n00:21:17.710 --> 00:21:22.820\npolicy change, privilege use, process\ntracking, and system events, right?\n\n390\n00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:27.530\nAnd again, for this exam, we will focus,\nI guess, on the file access auditing.\n\n391\n00:21:27.530 --> 00:21:29.540\nBut I don't see a file access auditing,\nCherokee.\n\n392\n00:21:29.540 --> 00:21:31.030\nWhat is up with that?\n\n393\n00:21:31.030 --> 00:21:31.736\n&gt;&gt; I don't know.\n\n394\n00:21:31.736 --> 00:21:32.691\nYou're gonna tell us, right?\n\n395\n00:21:32.691 --> 00:21:35.412\n&gt;&gt; I am, I hope so, right?\n\n396\n00:21:35.412 --> 00:21:40.020\nObject access is what we would\nuse to do file access auditing.\n\n397\n00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:44.180\nI do wanna just make sure we're\naware of a couple of things.\n\n398\n00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:45.750\nMost of these are pretty straightforward.\n\n399\n00:21:45.750 --> 00:21:50.480\nAccount management,\nif somebody's creating new accounts or\n\n400\n00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:54.470\nmodifying existing accounts, that would\nbe a category I'd wanna turn off.\n\n401\n00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:56.126\nI needed to be made aware of that.\n\n402\n00:21:56.126 --> 00:22:00.377\nOr if I wanted to monitor\nthe manipulation, creation, or change, or\n\n403\n00:22:00.377 --> 00:22:04.845\nmodification of user accounts,\ndirectory service access, all right,\n\n404\n00:22:04.845 --> 00:22:10.820\naccessing Active Directory, object access,\nthings like accessing files and folders.\n\n405\n00:22:10.820 --> 00:22:15.060\nPolicy change, if anybody's making\nchange to policy on the system.\n\n406\n00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:18.260\nPrivilege use, anytime you're taking\nadvantage of one of the privileges\n\n407\n00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:20.350\nthat's been assigned to your user account.\n\n408\n00:22:20.350 --> 00:22:24.290\nProcess tracking is typically seen for\ntroubleshooting applications,\n\n409\n00:22:24.290 --> 00:22:28.830\ntrying to see what they're accessing,\nwhere they might be getting hung up.\n\n410\n00:22:28.830 --> 00:22:32.680\nTypically used in development and\nin system events, right,\n\n411\n00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:36.095\nthing that my system is\nrecording in the event viewer.\n\n412\n00:22:36.095 --> 00:22:39.520\nSo most of them are straightforward\nexcept for the logon events and\n\n413\n00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:40.941\nthe account logon events.\n\n414\n00:22:40.941 --> 00:22:43.405\nAnd this is the one\npeople get confused on.\n\n415\n00:22:43.405 --> 00:22:46.957\nIf I double-click on this,\nwe take a look at this Explain tab.\n\n416\n00:22:46.957 --> 00:22:49.406\nLet's see if they've got\na decent explanation here.\n\n417\n00:22:52.151 --> 00:22:55.953\nThe security center determines whether\nthe OS audits each time this computer\n\n418\n00:22:55.953 --> 00:22:58.790\nvalidates an account credentials,\nall right.\n\n419\n00:22:58.790 --> 00:23:04.251\nRemember that, versus logon events,\nwhether the OS audits each instance\n\n420\n00:23:04.251 --> 00:23:09.032\nof a user attempting to log on or\nlog off to this computer, right?\n\n421\n00:23:09.032 --> 00:23:12.967\nSubtle, but very important\ndifference between those two.\n\n422\n00:23:12.967 --> 00:23:17.390\nA logon event occurs when I try\nto log on to this machine, right?\n\n423\n00:23:17.390 --> 00:23:23.350\nAn account logon event occurs wherever\nthose credentials are being verified.\n\n424\n00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:25.760\nI gotta stop and\nthink about that for a second.\n\n425\n00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:30.050\nIf I'm in a domain environment and\nI sit down at my work computer and\n\n426\n00:23:30.050 --> 00:23:33.550\nI go to logon,\nwhere are my credentials being validated?\n\n427\n00:23:33.550 --> 00:23:34.530\nDo you know, Cherokee?\n\n428\n00:23:34.530 --> 00:23:39.050\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nif I have some kind of AAA server,\n\n429\n00:23:39.050 --> 00:23:42.050\nsome kind of authorization server,\nthen maybe there.\n\n430\n00:23:42.050 --> 00:23:45.830\nOr otherwise in our domain\ncontroller with an Active Directory.\n\n431\n00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:48.170\n&gt;&gt; Exactly my domain controller\nis doing the authentication.\n\n432\n00:23:48.170 --> 00:23:49.497\nThat's the one that has my user account.\n\n433\n00:23:49.497 --> 00:23:50.852\nIt knows what my password is.\n\n434\n00:23:50.852 --> 00:23:54.283\nSo when I go to log on, my credentials,\nwhatever I type into that field,\n\n435\n00:23:54.283 --> 00:23:58.248\nare gonna be bundled up, right, secured,\nencrypted, sent across the network.\n\n436\n00:23:58.248 --> 00:24:01.732\nAnd it's the domain controller that's\nverifying that I've typed in the right\n\n437\n00:24:01.732 --> 00:24:02.256\npassword.\n\n438\n00:24:02.256 --> 00:24:05.686\nAll right, that's where the account\nlogon event is gonna occur.\n\n439\n00:24:05.686 --> 00:24:11.620\nAn account logon event occurs wherever the\nsystem is that's doing the authentication.\n\n440\n00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:15.350\nThe logon event occurs,\nwherever you're actually logging on.\n\n441\n00:24:15.350 --> 00:24:19.040\nSo, if I sit down at my work\ncomputer that's part of a domain,\n\n442\n00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:22.240\nmy work computer will\nregister a logon event.\n\n443\n00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:25.079\nThe domain controller will\nregister an account logon event.\n\n444\n00:24:26.090 --> 00:24:29.180\nIf I'm logging on with a local\naccount right, not a domain account,\n\n445\n00:24:29.180 --> 00:24:32.415\na local account, that account\nis stored in my local SAM file.\n\n446\n00:24:32.415 --> 00:24:35.646\nRight, the security account\nmanager on my local machine.\n\n447\n00:24:35.646 --> 00:24:40.300\nSo if I logon with a local account, my\nmachine is gonna register a logon event,\n\n448\n00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:42.130\nbecause that's where I'm logging on.\n\n449\n00:24:42.130 --> 00:24:44.170\nIt's also gonna register\nthe account log on event,\n\n450\n00:24:44.170 --> 00:24:47.330\nbecause that's where\nthe credentials are being verified.\n\n451\n00:24:47.330 --> 00:24:50.880\nThe reason I'm stressing this to you\nis when you're turning on auditing, and\n\n452\n00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:55.010\nwe're enabling these categories, we've\ngotta understand where I wanna do this.\n\n453\n00:24:55.010 --> 00:25:00.330\nIf I enable account logon event\nauditing on my Windows 10 machine, but\n\n454\n00:25:00.330 --> 00:25:04.315\nI'm logging in with a domain account,\nI'm never gonna see anything, right?\n\n455\n00:25:04.315 --> 00:25:06.442\nBecause my machine is not\ndoing the verification.\n\n456\n00:25:06.442 --> 00:25:09.880\nSo I didn't you make sure the policy\nis scooped appropriately.\n\n457\n00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:14.050\nThat the policy that says hey,\nyou need to audit account logon events,\n\n458\n00:25:14.050 --> 00:25:16.250\nshould be linked to my domain\ncontrollers only, tight?\n\n459\n00:25:16.250 --> 00:25:21.115\nNot my client machines, so something\nthat we need to think about there.\n\n460\n00:25:21.115 --> 00:25:24.590\nAll right, so\nlet's take a look at object access.\n\n461\n00:25:24.590 --> 00:25:28.200\nIf I double click on audit object access,\nI'll zoom in here so\n\n462\n00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:31.840\nwe can see this, the first thing\nI needed to do is turn it on.\n\n463\n00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:35.410\nDefine these policy settings right,\nso just enable this.\n\n464\n00:25:35.410 --> 00:25:41.210\nAnd then below that I've got audit these\nattempts, success, failure, or both.\n\n465\n00:25:41.210 --> 00:25:44.845\nAll right, now what this policy is doing?\n\n466\n00:25:44.845 --> 00:25:49.250\nIs it telling whatever I've scope\ntypically to out file servers, right?\n\n467\n00:25:49.250 --> 00:25:53.650\nIt saying you can now audit success and\nfailure, but\n\n468\n00:25:53.650 --> 00:25:57.650\nnotice it's not saying over\nwhat particular resource.\n\n469\n00:25:57.650 --> 00:26:01.280\nWhen we enable file access auditing\nlike this, it's a two step process.\n\n470\n00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:04.480\nWe have to enable the policy\nthat gives the server or\n\n471\n00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:07.780\nthe client machine the ability\nto do the auditing.\n\n472\n00:26:07.780 --> 00:26:12.074\nBut we still have to go to the objects\nthemselves, the files, the folders,\n\n473\n00:26:12.074 --> 00:26:14.908\nwhatever it is we're trying\nto audit access for.\n\n474\n00:26:14.908 --> 00:26:17.500\nAnd we have to enable it there as well,\nright?\n\n475\n00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:21.490\nIt isn't just turn it on and say, okay,\nI'm gonna audit everything that goes on.\n\n476\n00:26:21.490 --> 00:26:26.140\nHere, you're just enabling\naudit object access, right?\n\n477\n00:26:26.140 --> 00:26:29.226\nSo let me zoom back out,\nand I'll click OK.\n\n478\n00:26:29.226 --> 00:26:33.150\nAnd this policy is actually\nlinked to the domain level, so\n\n479\n00:26:33.150 --> 00:26:36.442\nit should apply to my\ndomain controller as well.\n\n480\n00:26:36.442 --> 00:26:38.700\nSo I'll go ahead and\nclose this group policy management.\n\n481\n00:26:38.700 --> 00:26:43.620\nAnd I could be using a local policy on\na Windows 10 client, right, just the same.\n\n482\n00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:47.130\nAnd I'll go ahead and\nclose group policy management.\n\n483\n00:26:47.130 --> 00:26:48.990\nI do need to update my policy, right?\n\n484\n00:26:48.990 --> 00:26:51.366\nBecause I just made a change to policy,\nand\n\n485\n00:26:51.366 --> 00:26:54.205\nI know we've talked about\nthat in other episodes.\n\n486\n00:26:54.205 --> 00:27:01.020\nSo let me real quick, I say real\nquick as it paints my typing in here.\n\n487\n00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:05.908\nLet me do a little GP update,\nIt's thinking about it.\n\n488\n00:27:05.908 --> 00:27:07.237\nSwitch force.\n\n489\n00:27:07.237 --> 00:27:12.144\nJust a refresh by group policies\nof my domain controllers\n\n490\n00:27:12.144 --> 00:27:15.314\naware of its audited capabilities.\n\n491\n00:27:15.314 --> 00:27:18.074\nAlright, so let that refresh.\n\n492\n00:27:18.074 --> 00:27:21.753\nSo, now my server knows\nthat it can audit or\n\n493\n00:27:21.753 --> 00:27:26.488\nits been told that it can\naudit success failure I still\n\n494\n00:27:26.488 --> 00:27:31.490\nhave to go to the actual objects and\ndo I have anything on this guy?\n\n495\n00:27:31.490 --> 00:27:35.380\nLet's see here,\nyeah let's go to this doc's folder.\n\n496\n00:27:35.380 --> 00:27:38.145\nSo what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna\nright click on this folder, and\n\n497\n00:27:38.145 --> 00:27:39.570\nchoose properties, all right.\n\n498\n00:27:41.230 --> 00:27:43.970\nOn this properties pane I'm\ngonna go to the security tab.\n\n499\n00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:48.640\nAnd then down at the bottom of that\nsecurity tab, I'm gonna click Advanced.\n\n500\n00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:52.840\nRemember we talked about this when we\nwere talking about file permissions.\n\n501\n00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:56.580\nAnd we looked at these advanced settings,\nand I mentioned that those security\n\n502\n00:27:56.580 --> 00:27:59.660\nsettings, the aces are stored\nin what's known as a DACL, or\n\n503\n00:27:59.660 --> 00:28:01.870\na discretionary access control list.\n\n504\n00:28:01.870 --> 00:28:05.260\nAuditing is done through he SACL,\nwe mentioned that term, SACL,\n\n505\n00:28:05.260 --> 00:28:07.440\nSystem Access Control List.\n\n506\n00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:10.030\nThat's where we store\nour auditing settings.\n\n507\n00:28:10.030 --> 00:28:12.520\nSo it tells me I need to be\nan administrator to work with this,\n\n508\n00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:13.380\ndo I wanna continue?\n\n509\n00:28:13.380 --> 00:28:16.226\nI'm going to say yes, yes I do.\n\n510\n00:28:16.226 --> 00:28:20.969\nAll right, and now I have the ability\nto add my auditing entries.\n\n511\n00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:25.120\nAnd Cherokee, I don't wanna,\nI know she's giving me the high sign.\n\n512\n00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:28.010\nWe're getting ready to run out of time,\nand I've got a lot more to do here and\n\n513\n00:28:28.010 --> 00:28:29.220\nI don't wanna rush through this.\n\n514\n00:28:29.220 --> 00:28:31.560\nSo this might be a good place\nto take a little break.\n\n515\n00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:33.490\n&gt;&gt; Okay, well, let's go ahead and\npause this, Mike.\n\n516\n00:28:33.490 --> 00:28:34.940\nSo you don't wanna miss\nout on the next show,\n\n517\n00:28:34.940 --> 00:28:36.580\nbecause we're gonna pick\nright back up here.\n\n518\n00:28:36.580 --> 00:28:38.220\nBut for now, we'll sign out.\n\n519\n00:28:38.220 --> 00:28:39.610\nI've been your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n520\n00:28:39.610 --> 00:28:40.440\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n521\n00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:43.444\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n522\n00:28:43.444 --> 00:28:49.396\n[MUSIC]\n\n523\n00:28:49.396 --> 00:28:52.937\nThank you for

California.\n\n3\n00:00:05.905 --> 00:00:06.445\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:06.445 --> 00:00:08.189\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.980\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:14.751\n&gt;&gt; Welcome everyone to your\nConfigure Windows Devices series.\n\n7\n00:00:14.751 --> 00:00:17.290\nI'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n8\n00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:19.270\nIf you haven't checked\nout the last episode,\n\n9\n00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:22.214\nthen we would highly encourage you\nto do so because in this show we're\n\n10\n00:00:22.214 --> 00:00:25.598\ngonna be picking back up with a part two\nright in the middle of a demonstration.\n\n11\n00:00:25.598 --> 00:00:29.430\nWhere we're looking at how to configure\nour file access and auditing.\n\n12\n00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:32.438\nAnd of course with us today back\nin studios to continue with that\n\n13\n00:00:32.438 --> 00:00:35.522\ndemonstration is Mr.\nMike Rodrick, how's it going Mike?\n\n14\n00:00:35.522 --> 00:00:37.618\n&gt;&gt; It's going great Cherokee,\nthanks for having me back and\n\n15\n00:00:37.618 --> 00:00:39.060\nyeah that's my cliffhanger, right?\n\n16\n00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:40.420\nMake sure you have to come back and\nwatch part two.\n\n17\n00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:41.170\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n18\n00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.600\n&gt;&gt; Just chop off the demo\nright in the middle of it.\n\n19\n00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.980\nAll right, so if we, to rehash what\nwe've done, we've talked about auditing,\n\n20\n00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.160\nI showed you the different categories and\nwe explained those.\n\n21\n00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.530\nWe're really focusing in\non file access auditing.\n\n22\n00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.030\nWe've already gone to our group policy and\nwe've enabled, or\n\n23\n00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.450\nwe've enabled file access auditing,\nwe set up success and failure, right?\n\n24\n00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:05.489\nNow, we've gone to a folder on our\nhard drive on that server, and\n\n25\n00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:06.882\nI have right-clicked on it.\n\n26\n00:01:06.882 --> 00:01:11.610\nIn fact, here, let's just do that part\nagain, so we kind of know where we're at.\n\n27\n00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.810\nI'm gonna right-click on docs and\nchoose properties.\n\n28\n00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.788\nAnd then I'm gonna go to the security tab,\nclick advanced, and then I'm\n\n29\n00:01:19.788 --> 00:01:25.110\ngonna go to the auditing tab and choose\ncontinue because I do want to continue.\n\n30\n00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.490\nAll right, now,\nwe can set up our auditing.\n\n31\n00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:33.350\nSo it's telling me up here what it is\nC:\\Docs, who the current owner is, and\n\n32\n00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:38.590\nthen bellow this, I have my audit entries,\nof which there aren't any currently.\n\n33\n00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.790\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nclick add, to add a new entry and\n\n34\n00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.650\nI'm gonna zoom back out, and\nthis is where we were just a minute ago.\n\n35\n00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:47.810\nSo the first thing I'm gonna do,\nI'm gonna audit.\n\n36\n00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.345\nI have to decide who I want to audit,\nmight be everybody.\n\n37\n00:01:51.345 --> 00:01:55.985\nIf this is a file that's controlled by\nsome kind of regulation or standard or\n\n38\n00:01:55.985 --> 00:02:00.910\nsomething, maybe you access,\nyou audit everybody, maybe you don't.\n\n39\n00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:07.060\nYou really have to plan out auditing\nbecause auditing can eat up a lot of disk\n\n40\n00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.970\nspace with the number of entries that it's\ngonna end up creating in our log file.\n\n41\n00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.159\nAnd if it's a file, let's say it's\nthe employee handbook, right?\n\n42\n00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:18.361\nWell, everybody should have read\naccess to that handbook, and\n\n43\n00:02:18.361 --> 00:02:20.870\nI'm okay with everybody\nreading that handbook.\n\n44\n00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.774\nAnd I don't wanna be notified every\ntime somebody reads that handbook or\n\n45\n00:02:24.774 --> 00:02:25.867\nhave an entry made.\n\n46\n00:02:25.867 --> 00:02:30.214\nIf someone tries to change the handbook,\nor tries to delete the handbook,\n\n47\n00:02:30.214 --> 00:02:31.710\nnow I've got a problem.\n\n48\n00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:33.178\nMaybe that I want to audit for.\n\n49\n00:02:33.178 --> 00:02:35.155\nOr, if it's marketing stuff and\n\n50\n00:02:35.155 --> 00:02:39.248\nI'm trying to make sure that\nsalespeople are not getting into that,\n\n51\n00:02:39.248 --> 00:02:43.146\nI want to audit if sales people\ntry to access that marketing info.\n\n52\n00:02:43.146 --> 00:02:47.440\nBut if marketing accesses it, I don't need\nto know, because it's marketing stuff.\n\n53\n00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:48.990\nThey're supposed to have access.\n\n54\n00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.934\nSo you wanna plan this out.\n\n55\n00:02:49.934 --> 00:02:53.610\nYou really wanna think about what\nis it that I need to capture?\n\n56\n00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.590\nAnd I'm not saying there's not\nscenarios where you need to know\n\n57\n00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.260\nevery time anybody\naccesses the file at all.\n\n58\n00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.511\nBut there's many times when I just need to\nknow if somebody's trying to delete, or\n\n59\n00:03:04.511 --> 00:03:07.000\na particular group of users\nis trying to read, or\n\n60\n00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.020\nsomebody's trying to write, right?\n\n61\n00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:11.518\nAnd we can be very specific with\nwhat we're trying to audit, and\n\n62\n00:03:11.518 --> 00:03:13.300\nthat's what we're setting up here.\n\n63\n00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:15.770\n&gt;&gt; But Mike, if I have the ability\nto monitor everything,\n\n64\n00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:17.390\nwhy would I not want to?\n\n65\n00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:18.410\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna show you.\n\n66\n00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:22.320\nAnd again, the biggest thing is that\nall of our auditing entry show up in\n\n67\n00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:27.700\nthe security log on the event or\nin the event log system of the server\n\n68\n00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.660\nthat's doing the auditing, or on the\nclient machine, whatever the case may be.\n\n69\n00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:37.275\nAnd those event logs have a maximum\nsize set, we can control that, but\n\n70\n00:03:37.275 --> 00:03:43.767\nwhat can happen is one, we can eat up all\nof our disk space by growing our log file.\n\n71\n00:03:43.767 --> 00:03:47.751\nOr if our log file is set to cyclical or\nto delete older entries to make room for\n\n72\n00:03:47.751 --> 00:03:51.049\nnew ones, well, if we start\npumping lots of new data in there,\n\n73\n00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:55.000\nold entries are getting bumped off,\nand those could have been important.\n\n74\n00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.610\nThere's just a lot of bad things\ncan happen if we start fill,\n\n75\n00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:01.580\nit makes it hard to find\nuseful information in\n\n76\n00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:02.663\nthe security log if it's-\n&gt;&gt; You're trying to\n\n77\n00:04:02.663 --> 00:04:03.166\nsift through all of that,\nand it's unnecessary.\n\n78\n00:04:03.166 --> 00:04:07.654\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's filled up with Cherokee read\nthe handbook, Cherokee read the handbook,\n\n79\n00:04:07.654 --> 00:04:09.460\nit's like okay, you know?\n\n80\n00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:13.675\nAnd because I can't find the important\nstuff in there I miss out,\n\n81\n00:04:13.675 --> 00:04:15.064\non important stuff.\n\n82\n00:04:15.064 --> 00:04:17.470\nSo, let's take a look at\nhow we can set this up.\n\n83\n00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:19.774\nThe first thing you do,\nagain, is select principal.\n\n84\n00:04:19.774 --> 00:04:22.736\nThis is how we decide who it\nis we are going to audit.\n\n85\n00:04:22.736 --> 00:04:25.880\nAnd maybe I do want to do everyone.\n\n86\n00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:29.590\nAnd I can dump the everyone\ngroup in there.\n\n87\n00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:32.956\nOr maybe I just want to\naudit the directors, and\n\n88\n00:04:32.956 --> 00:04:37.515\nsee when they are accessing this\nparticular resource, right?\n\n89\n00:04:37.515 --> 00:04:42.020\nSo just like setting up NTFS permissions,\nI can use individual users.\n\n90\n00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:44.840\nI can do groups,\nI can use my everyone group.\n\n91\n00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.140\nI can do authenticated users.\n\n92\n00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:49.330\nJust depends on what it\nis I'm trying to do.\n\n93\n00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.750\nFor this demo to make my life easy,\nI'm gonna do everyone, so\n\n94\n00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:55.350\nI don't have to worry about\nwhat account I'm logged in as.\n\n95\n00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:56.987\nBut understand I'm doing that just for\ndemonstration.\n\n96\n00:04:56.987 --> 00:04:59.930\nYou're gonna want to be a little more\nspecific with what you are doing.\n\n97\n00:05:01.262 --> 00:05:03.480\nAll right, and\nI will go ahead and click OK.\n\n98\n00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:07.810\nSo, who is it that I'm trying to audit,\nand then what do I want to audit?\n\n99\n00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:09.870\nSuccess, failure, or both.\n\n100\n00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:14.596\nAll right, now here is another\nlittle gotcha that you've\n\n101\n00:05:14.596 --> 00:05:18.363\ngot to watch out for,\nI could choose all here.\n\n102\n00:05:18.363 --> 00:05:22.951\nWhich would monitor both success and\nfailure, but remember, in the previous\n\n103\n00:05:22.951 --> 00:05:28.220\nepisode, when we turned on auditing, I\nhad to choose success or failure or both.\n\n104\n00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:33.020\nIf I only did success in the policy,\nright, and then I come to the server and\n\n105\n00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:36.320\nI try to monitor all,\nit's only going to monitor success,\n\n106\n00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:40.100\nbecause the policy is telling the server\nwhat it's allowed to do, right?\n\n107\n00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:42.370\nAnd saying here to monitor both,\n\n108\n00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:45.680\nif the policy only said success,\nit wouldn't do it.\n\n109\n00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:49.220\nBecause it didn't, because that group\npolicy didn't enable that feature.\n\n110\n00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:52.763\nWell, something else to keep in mind,\nwe've got to make sure that those match.\n\n111\n00:05:52.763 --> 00:05:55.875\nWhich is typically why I will\ndo both in the policy, and\n\n112\n00:05:55.875 --> 00:05:58.660\nthen control what I'm\nactually auditing here.\n\n113\n00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:01.080\nJust success, just failure, or all.\n\n114\n00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:06.227\nAnother part of the planning process,\nwhat is it that I need to audit?\n\n115\n00:06:06.227 --> 00:06:12.825\nIf I'm auditing access to the file, again,\nthink about that employee handbook.\n\n116\n00:06:12.825 --> 00:06:17.085\nMaybe I need to know when people fail to\nread the document, when access is denied,\n\n117\n00:06:17.085 --> 00:06:20.300\nfor some reason, and\nthey're not able to open that.\n\n118\n00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:21.780\nThat's the one I need to know about,\n\n119\n00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:24.980\nbecause I want my employees to\nread the employee handbook.\n\n120\n00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:27.960\nBut if they succeed in opening in it,\nI don't mind that,\n\n121\n00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:29.070\nthat's a good thing, right?\n\n122\n00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:32.195\nAnd I don't need to see\nthose particular entries.\n\n123\n00:06:32.195 --> 00:06:36.390\nLogon events are another one\nthat I usually use an example.\n\n124\n00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:39.000\nDo you want all logon events?\n\n125\n00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.601\nYou might think, well, yeah, you know,\nlet's just do failed log-in events.\n\n126\n00:06:41.601 --> 00:06:45.836\nThat's really what I want to monitor, is\nwhen somebody is trying to break into my\n\n127\n00:06:45.836 --> 00:06:48.907\nsystem doing password guessing,\nor some type of attack.\n\n128\n00:06:48.907 --> 00:06:51.210\nSo I wanna see failed log-on events.\n\n129\n00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:55.240\nSo I go ahead and do failed logon events\nor account logon events, I should say.\n\n130\n00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:59.040\nSo what'll happen is, but\nI don't do success, because I think, okay,\n\n131\n00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:02.820\nI don't need to see those,\nthat's just extra entries in my log file.\n\n132\n00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:04.270\nWell, here's what can happen.\n\n133\n00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:06.920\nI start seeing entries at\n1:00 o'clock in the morning,\n\n134\n00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:09.580\nwhen nobody's on the system or\nshould be at work, right.\n\n135\n00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:14.490\nAnd I see these failed logon attempts, one\nafter the other right, just go, go, go.\n\n136\n00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:19.380\nBut I'm only monitoring failure,\nand at 1:20, the events stop.\n\n137\n00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:20.930\nThere's no more failed logon events.\n\n138\n00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:25.690\nBecause I'm only monitoring failure,\nI don't know what happened.\n\n139\n00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:27.874\nDid the person give up and stop trying?\n\n140\n00:07:27.874 --> 00:07:31.360\nDoes somebody walk by, maybe,\nand they ran away, scared?\n\n141\n00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:34.987\nOr, did they succeed and\nfinally guess the right password, and\n\n142\n00:07:34.987 --> 00:07:36.408\nmake it into the system?\n\n143\n00:07:36.408 --> 00:07:39.921\nI don't know, because I wasn't\nmonitoring successful logons, right?\n\n144\n00:07:39.921 --> 00:07:42.993\nSo again, a lot of planning\nhas to go into creating and\n\n145\n00:07:42.993 --> 00:07:45.248\nsetting up your audit policies.\n\n146\n00:07:45.248 --> 00:07:48.148\nTypically, like in my positions,\nthat I've worked in different\n\n147\n00:07:48.148 --> 00:07:50.335\norganizations I'm not\nthe one that makes those.\n\n148\n00:07:50.335 --> 00:07:51.810\nI'm the one that just implements.\n\n149\n00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:52.980\n&gt;&gt; Enforces that yeah.\n\n150\n00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:56.480\n&gt;&gt; They tell me, this is what\nregulations say we need to audit.\n\n151\n00:07:56.480 --> 00:08:00.250\nHIPAA says I need to know any time,\nanybody touches any of these.\n\n152\n00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:01.520\nI can go in and make that policy, right?\n\n153\n00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:04.150\nThat's really what, my side affects.\n\n154\n00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:08.240\nBut I do wanna stress that it is\nvery important to plan this out.\n\n155\n00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:08.926\nAll right, so what am I gonna do?\n\n156\n00:08:08.926 --> 00:08:10.710\nI'm gonna go ahead and monitor all.\n\n157\n00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:15.273\nDo I want it to be, again,\nkinda like NTFS permissions,\n\n158\n00:08:15.273 --> 00:08:19.170\njust subfolders and files or\neverything, we can choose that.\n\n159\n00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:21.850\nAnd then below there, the permissions.\n\n160\n00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:25.070\nAs I said earlier,\nyou can do full control.\n\n161\n00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:28.460\nBut if they're allowed to read,\nmaybe I don't want to monitor read.\n\n162\n00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:32.120\nMaybe I just wanna monitor writes or\nmodifies.\n\n163\n00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:34.100\nAgain, part of the planning process.\n\n164\n00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:36.017\nI'm gonna do full control just so\n\n165\n00:08:36.017 --> 00:08:40.335\nI can monitor everything to make this\ndemo a little bit easier, all right?\n\n166\n00:08:40.335 --> 00:08:42.550\nLet me zoom back out.\n\n167\n00:08:42.550 --> 00:08:44.310\nAnd that's all we're gonna deal with.\n\n168\n00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:48.210\nYou could go into the advanced permissions\nif you wanna be a little more granular.\n\n169\n00:08:48.210 --> 00:08:50.540\nRemember how we talked about\nwith NTFS permissions?\n\n170\n00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:54.231\nMaybe I wanna know if\nthey read attributes,\n\n171\n00:08:54.231 --> 00:08:57.234\nbut not read extended attributes.\n\n172\n00:08:57.234 --> 00:09:01.311\n[LAUGH] I've never in my\nlife used the more granular,\n\n173\n00:09:01.311 --> 00:09:07.050\njust good to know that they're there,\nespecially for the exam.\n\n174\n00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:10.240\nAnd we're not dealing with\nconditional access at this point, so\n\n175\n00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:15.174\nwe're going to skip the bottom part,\nand I'm simply going to click okay,\n\n176\n00:09:15.174 --> 00:09:18.250\nand okay.\n\n177\n00:09:18.250 --> 00:09:20.170\nAnd I'll click okay in the properties.\n\n178\n00:09:20.170 --> 00:09:23.990\nAnd that's it, we've set up the group\npolicy to enable file access auditing or\n\n179\n00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:24.798\nobject access.\n\n180\n00:09:24.798 --> 00:09:27.268\nAnd now we've gone to the object itself,\nand\n\n181\n00:09:27.268 --> 00:09:31.380\nconfigured the cycle to tell it\nwhat it is we want to audit.\n\n182\n00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:34.020\nNow what I'm gonna do is,\nI'm actually gonna close File Explorer.\n\n183\n00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:38.000\nAnd I'm gonna open up my Event Viewer.\n\n184\n00:09:41.758 --> 00:09:46.151\nAnd I'm gonna go down to my Windows\nlogs and go to my security log.\n\n185\n00:09:46.151 --> 00:09:49.240\nWow, 204,000 events I've got there.\n\n186\n00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:51.250\nThis might take a minute to load up.\n\n187\n00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:53.400\nWe'll give it just a second, there we go.\n\n188\n00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:54.680\nDomain controllers, by default,\n\n189\n00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:59.820\nthis is my domain controller, and\nthey do some auditing by default.\n\n190\n00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:02.420\nThat's the default domain controller\npolicy, it's linked to the domain\n\n191\n00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:06.460\ncontroller, so you, so which is why\nyou see some entries in here already.\n\n192\n00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:10.140\nBut I'm gonna clear the log, and\nI'm actually just gonna clear it and\n\n193\n00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:11.220\nnot save it.\n\n194\n00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:14.590\nSo a huge no-no, don't ever do\nthis in the real world, please.\n\n195\n00:10:14.590 --> 00:10:17.720\nYou might wanna save all of those,\nin case you need them for\n\n196\n00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:22.340\nfuture reference to go back in and\nresearch the security log.\n\n197\n00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:25.527\nBut I'm gonna clear it simply so\nI can show you,\n\n198\n00:10:25.527 --> 00:10:30.640\nI'm now going to the File Explorer,\nI'm gonna navigate over to my C drive.\n\n199\n00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:33.020\nI'm gonna double-click on Docs.\n\n200\n00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:36.128\nAnd I'm going to open up one\nof those documents there.\n\n201\n00:10:36.128 --> 00:10:38.120\nAnd I'll make a change.\n\n202\n00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:39.160\nI'll just wipe that out.\n\n203\n00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:41.520\n&gt;&gt; I was never there.\n\n204\n00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:42.705\n&gt;&gt; It's like you were never there.\n\n205\n00:10:42.705 --> 00:10:45.060\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And I'll close it.\n\n206\n00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:47.820\nI could've just opened it, because\nwe said we were auditing everything.\n\n207\n00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:50.220\nRead, write, modify, all of that.\n\n208\n00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:51.999\nAnd I'll go ahead and close File Explorer.\n\n209\n00:10:51.999 --> 00:10:55.876\nNow, I'm gonna come back over\nhere to my event log and\n\n210\n00:10:55.876 --> 00:11:01.840\nI'm going to refresh my view, and [SOUND]\nthere's a lot of auditing going on here.\n\n211\n00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:06.457\nNow, not all of this has to\ndo with my object access, but\n\n212\n00:11:06.457 --> 00:11:08.734\na good majority of it does.\n\n213\n00:11:08.734 --> 00:11:13.173\nRight here, this removable storage,\nhandle manipulation,\n\n214\n00:11:13.173 --> 00:11:17.810\nwe take a look, oops,\njust double-click on one of those.\n\n215\n00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:21.145\nYou can see that LabMike requested access,\n\n216\n00:11:21.145 --> 00:11:25.755\nthe process was File Explorer,\nor explorer.exe, right?\n\n217\n00:11:25.755 --> 00:11:28.678\nAnd so each one of these\nentries is something to do\n\n218\n00:11:28.678 --> 00:11:33.258\nwith me requesting access to that file,\nright, opening up File Explorer.\n\n219\n00:11:33.258 --> 00:11:36.556\nJust clicking on the folder, well,\nit has to list the folder contents,\n\n220\n00:11:36.556 --> 00:11:38.730\nassuming that I have that permission.\n\n221\n00:11:38.730 --> 00:11:41.380\nWell, it's gonna audit that, and\nthen, when I open that folder,\n\n222\n00:11:41.380 --> 00:11:43.360\nit's gotta list the files inside there.\n\n223\n00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:43.935\nIt's gotta audit that.\n\n224\n00:11:43.935 --> 00:11:48.160\nThat I selected doc01, that I\ndouble-clicked on it and it opened up.\n\n225\n00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:52.010\nNotepad was requested to open that file.\n\n226\n00:11:52.010 --> 00:11:54.420\nThen I made changes and\nI saved it and I closed it.\n\n227\n00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:59.014\nI handed, all of this is being tracked,\nbecause I said I want to track everything,\n\n228\n00:11:59.014 --> 00:11:59.681\nall right.\n\n229\n00:11:59.681 --> 00:12:06.320\n&gt;&gt; But where's that one, that successful\nlogin at 1 AM that you were talking about.\n\n230\n00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:07.815\nI just don't see it there.\n\n231\n00:12:07.815 --> 00:12:10.330\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Trying to find it in here.\n\n232\n00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:14.470\nCould be challenging,\nI guess, to say the least.\n\n233\n00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:17.865\n&gt;&gt; At least we do have our little\nfilter icon to help eliminate some of\n\n234\n00:12:17.865 --> 00:12:18.676\nthe nonsense.\n\n235\n00:12:18.676 --> 00:12:21.350\n&gt;&gt; I was trying to see if I could,\nyes, it is.\n\n236\n00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:25.520\nAt this point you're really\ngonna be looking at event IDs.\n\n237\n00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:27.830\nYou're gonna have to know what\nit is you're looking for and\n\n238\n00:12:27.830 --> 00:12:29.921\nyou're gonna have to filter that log,\nabsolutely.\n\n239\n00:12:29.921 --> 00:12:33.230\nBut the moral of the story is,\nthat's one user,\n\n240\n00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:37.620\naccessing one file that I've\nconfigured auditing for.\n\n241\n00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:40.848\nNow, multiply that by thousands of files,\n\n242\n00:12:40.848 --> 00:12:45.822\nacross dozens of shares, and\nthousands of users accessing it, and\n\n243\n00:12:45.822 --> 00:12:50.272\nyou can see why I really need\nto plan out my auditing, right,\n\n244\n00:12:50.272 --> 00:12:55.883\nI wanna control or think about what it\nis I really need to record, all right?\n\n245\n00:12:55.883 --> 00:13:00.000\nAll right, so I think that's good for\nthe basics of auditing.\n\n246\n00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.440\nI do wanna show you one more thing.\n\n247\n00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:04.840\nI'm gonna go into Group Policy again.\n\n248\n00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:07.410\nI'm on my domain controller, same thing,\n\n249\n00:13:07.410 --> 00:13:10.100\nif I was doing this on my local machine,\nright?\n\n250\n00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:12.724\nI'm gonna click Edit.\n\n251\n00:13:12.724 --> 00:13:13.740\nActually, I take that back.\n\n252\n00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:16.156\nThese categories,\nwe should go check and see.\n\n253\n00:13:16.156 --> 00:13:19.560\nA couple of editions ago,\nI wanna say, it was 2008,\n\n254\n00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:23.240\nthey've added some new\nauditing categories.\n\n255\n00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:27.030\nI showed you that these auditing settings\nwere underneath computer configuration,\n\n256\n00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:29.950\npolicies, Windows settings,\n\n257\n00:13:29.950 --> 00:13:34.880\nsecurity settings, local policies,\nand then audit policy.\n\n258\n00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:36.670\nAnd I've got these,\nI want to say it's nine, yeah,\n\n259\n00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:40.830\nI've got these nine\ncategories that I can audit.\n\n260\n00:13:40.830 --> 00:13:43.920\nWell, I want to say again,\n2008, they added a new one.\n\n261\n00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:52.320\nDown here towards the bottom, I'm gonna\nsee advanced audit policy configuration.\n\n262\n00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:57.167\nAnd underneath that, I've got audit\npolicies, and underneath that,\n\n263\n00:13:57.167 --> 00:13:59.958\nI've got a whole slew of new categories.\n\n264\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:05.844\nAccount log on, account management,\ndetailed tracking, object access.\n\n265\n00:14:05.844 --> 00:14:07.350\nLook at all of these.\n\n266\n00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:11.550\nThese are newer categories\nof auditing that we can do.\n\n267\n00:14:12.890 --> 00:14:16.655\nFrom what I've read in Microsoft's\ndocumentation, these advanced auto policy\n\n268\n00:14:16.655 --> 00:14:19.504\nconfigurations come in handy\nwhen you have specific things.\n\n269\n00:14:19.504 --> 00:14:22.650\nMaybe some regulations\nthat you need to follow.\n\n270\n00:14:22.650 --> 00:14:27.630\nTypically, what Microsoft says is,\nthese nine audit policy categories\n\n271\n00:14:27.630 --> 00:14:31.410\nhere should be fine for\nmost people in most circumstances.\n\n272\n00:14:31.410 --> 00:14:34.830\nOccasionally, you might have to do\na little more detailed logging, and\n\n273\n00:14:34.830 --> 00:14:38.835\nthat's when these other audit\npolicies come into play.\n\n274\n00:14:38.835 --> 00:14:42.940\nCause there's like object access,\naudit file system.\n\n275\n00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:47.808\nIn this case,\nit will audit everything on the server.\n\n276\n00:14:47.808 --> 00:14:50.441\nWe don't have to, you can see, only for\n\n277\n00:14:50.441 --> 00:14:55.600\nobjects that have (SACL) specified only\nif the type of access is requested.\n\n278\n00:14:55.600 --> 00:15:00.680\nSo we still have to configure the SACL.\n\n279\n00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:01.340\nAll right?\n\n280\n00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:04.210\nWe still have to enable\nthe auditing on the object itself.\n\n281\n00:15:04.210 --> 00:15:08.535\nBut it gives me the ability to otter,\nwhat the, otter.\n\n282\n00:15:08.535 --> 00:15:10.980\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna go to the zoo.\n\n283\n00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:13.587\nIt does give you some\ndifferent categories,\n\n284\n00:15:13.587 --> 00:15:16.958\na more detailed configuration\nof that file access audit.\n\n285\n00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:19.388\n&gt;&gt; The first thing that came to my mind\nwhen you were talking about this was\n\n286\n00:15:19.388 --> 00:15:20.180\nsomething like ITIL.\n\n287\n00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:23.440\nSo you know how that's just a framework or\nguideline?\n\n288\n00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:27.300\nSo this would be a way that we could\nimplement into that framework.\n\n289\n00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:32.823\nIt's not specifically, yeah, I don't know,\nit's not like called out per se.\n\n290\n00:15:32.823 --> 00:15:36.575\nBut that's just like as you said\na decision that maybe upper management,\n\n291\n00:15:36.575 --> 00:15:39.419\nor that C suite, or\nmaybe dictated by a regulation, and\n\n292\n00:15:39.419 --> 00:15:41.440\nthen we're just enforcing it here.\n\n293\n00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:42.570\n&gt;&gt; Yep, absolutely.\n\n294\n00:15:42.570 --> 00:15:47.790\nIf we take a look at my screen one\nmore time, this one down here,\n\n295\n00:15:47.790 --> 00:15:49.760\nGlobal Object Access Auditing.\n\n296\n00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:54.213\nNow, if we look at the explanation for\nthis one, this policy setting allows you\n\n297\n00:15:54.213 --> 00:15:58.068\nto apply a comprehensive object\naccess audit policy to every file and\n\n298\n00:15:58.068 --> 00:16:00.411\nfolder on the file system for a computer.\n\n299\n00:16:00.411 --> 00:16:02.344\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Super comprehensive.\n\n300\n00:16:02.344 --> 00:16:06.723\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I wanna say, it's, yeah,\n\n301\n00:16:06.723 --> 00:16:10.962\nit's basically a global cycle.\n\n302\n00:16:10.962 --> 00:16:14.468\nAnd you might have, like I said\nmaybe HIPAA or Sarbanes-Oxley or\n\n303\n00:16:14.468 --> 00:16:18.670\nsomething like that, that requires\nthis level of access auditing.\n\n304\n00:16:18.670 --> 00:16:21.590\nYou might have to prove\nto an auditor that comes\n\n305\n00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:25.790\nin that you are auditing your file system\nand access to these particular objects.\n\n306\n00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:30.491\nSo there are some more advanced policies\nwe can get into that give us a lot more\n\n307\n00:16:30.491 --> 00:16:31.162\ncontrol.\n\n308\n00:16:31.162 --> 00:16:34.408\nFor the exam, and for\nwhat most of us do with auditing,\n\n309\n00:16:34.408 --> 00:16:37.370\nthese nine categories\nare typically enough.\n\n310\n00:16:37.370 --> 00:16:38.250\n&gt;&gt; More than enough, yeah.\n\n311\n00:16:39.390 --> 00:16:40.260\n&gt;&gt; Alright, and Cherokee,\n\n312\n00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:45.310\nI believe that covers everything\nwe need to do with auditing.\n\n313\n00:16:45.310 --> 00:16:46.779\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And remember,\n\n314\n00:16:46.779 --> 00:16:52.889\nit goes into that security log, as far\nas where the auditing events show up.\n\n315\n00:16:52.889 --> 00:16:56.130\nThere is some auditing enabled by\ndefault on my domain controllers.\n\n316\n00:16:56.130 --> 00:16:58.060\nAs well as on the client-end nowadays.\n\n317\n00:16:58.060 --> 00:16:59.750\nDidn't used to be the case.\n\n318\n00:16:59.750 --> 00:17:03.860\nUsed to be the security log would always\nbe blank, when you first went into it.\n\n319\n00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:05.240\nHow secure is this?\n\n320\n00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:07.840\nIt's because the security log\nwas storing auditing events.\n\n321\n00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:11.385\nAnd if you hadn't enabled auditing, there\nwould be nothing in that security log.\n\n322\n00:17:11.385 --> 00:17:15.030\nNow, you will see there is\nsome auditing done by default.\n\n323\n00:17:15.030 --> 00:17:18.000\nSo yeah, that is auditing.\n\n324\n00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.940\n&gt;&gt; Well, Mike, thank you so much,\nI know you love talking about security,\n\n325\n00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:24.060\nand I don't think we are quite done\nhere with our Windows 10 shows, but for\n\n326\n00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:26.570\nnow let's go ahead and\nsign out of this one.\n\n327\n00:17:26.570 --> 00:17:28.050\nI have been your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n328\n00:17:28.050 --> 00:17:28.810\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike

You're watching ITPROTV.\n\n7\n00:00:11.852 --> 00:00:15.299\n&gt;&gt; Welcome everyone to your\nconfiguring Windows devices series,\n\n8\n00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.060\nstudying up for that 70-697 exam.\n\n9\n00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.730\nI'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n10\n00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:24.200\nIn this episode we're taking a look at how\nto configure remote desktop services, and\n\n11\n00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.760\nwith us today in studio\nis Mr Mike Rodrick.\n\n12\n00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:27.586\nHow's it going today Mike?\n\n13\n00:00:27.586 --> 00:00:29.451\n&gt;&gt; It's going great Cherokee,\nthanks for having me back.\n\n14\n00:00:29.451 --> 00:00:31.540\nExcited as always to be\ntalking about Windows 10.\n\n15\n00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:35.825\nAnd yeah we got a lot to do with good old\nremote connections, and remote desktop,\n\n16\n00:00:35.825 --> 00:00:39.117\nand lots of different remote\nthings we're gonna talk about.\n\n17\n00:00:39.117 --> 00:00:42.131\n&gt;&gt; Yeah we're not like remoting ourselves\nin the little tubes like in Jetsons that's\n\n18\n00:00:42.131 --> 00:00:43.173\nnot what we're doing here.\n\n19\n00:00:43.173 --> 00:00:46.400\n&gt;&gt; Not yet, not yet, that is coming right?\n\n20\n00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.906\nHopefully, but yeah so, we're gonna\ntake a look at config called out on\n\n21\n00:00:49.906 --> 00:00:53.126\nthe objectives, they talk about\nconfigure remote connections,\n\n22\n00:00:53.126 --> 00:00:55.845\none of the first ones they\nlist there is remote desktop.\n\n23\n00:00:55.845 --> 00:01:00.426\nAnd this is a pretty common technology\nthat we will use to connect remotely to\n\n24\n00:01:00.426 --> 00:01:02.340\nother machines, right.\n\n25\n00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.039\nAnd it might be a scenario where\nyou're IT, maybe you're help desk,\n\n26\n00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:09.945\nor something else in IT, and\nyou're responsible for managing servers.\n\n27\n00:01:09.945 --> 00:01:12.650\nAnd how do you configure,\nhow do you work with those servers?\n\n28\n00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.059\nThose servers are in the server closet,\nyou might or\n\n29\n00:01:15.059 --> 00:01:18.783\nmight not have a key to the server closet,\nanybody that's worked with servers on\n\n30\n00:01:18.783 --> 00:01:22.155\na physical location knows it's not fun,\ngoing into the server closet.\n\n31\n00:01:22.155 --> 00:01:26.670\nIt's typically nice and cool,\nwhich is a great thing here in Florida but\n\n32\n00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.980\nit's very loud, and\nit's usually not the neatest place to be.\n\n33\n00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:35.202\nI think our server closet is one of those\nfew exceptions, because we have a glass\n\n34\n00:01:35.202 --> 00:01:38.997\nwall and they're on camera all the time so\nwe try to keep it really tidy.\n\n35\n00:01:38.997 --> 00:01:41.261\nBut most of them you see\nare not nearly that nice.\n\n36\n00:01:41.261 --> 00:01:46.174\n&gt;&gt; And sometimes they're even far away in\ngeographical distances like sprawl and\n\n37\n00:01:46.174 --> 00:01:50.717\nif you don't have a large IT department or\nsomeone in that remote office,\n\n38\n00:01:50.717 --> 00:01:54.330\nthen there can be issues\nwhenever it comes to management.\n\n39\n00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.470\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so\nhow do I remotely manage those machines?\n\n40\n00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:00.580\nFor an end user though on a Windows 10.\n\n41\n00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:04.241\nAnd any IT as well, we are typically\nset at a Windows 10 console, and\n\n42\n00:02:04.241 --> 00:02:08.536\nmanaging our servers, but your end users\ncan end up using remote desktop as well.\n\n43\n00:02:08.536 --> 00:02:10.394\nIt might be scenarios where,\n\n44\n00:02:10.394 --> 00:02:15.340\nthey need to remote into some other\nmachine on the network for some reason.\n\n45\n00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.500\nWe might be using virtual desktops,\nwe might be allowing them to VPN in,\n\n46\n00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:20.930\nfrom the outside, and\n\n47\n00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.010\nremote into their work computer\nfrom when they are home, all right.\n\n48\n00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.320\nOr maybe they are remoting into\ntheir home computer from work.\n\n49\n00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.920\nProbably not, but I do that sometimes.\n\n50\n00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:30.730\nYou ever do that?\n\n51\n00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:31.931\nJust cause,\nI got some things on my home computer.\n\n52\n00:02:31.931 --> 00:02:33.889\n&gt;&gt; When I go home, I go home.\n\n53\n00:02:33.889 --> 00:02:34.614\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n54\n00:02:34.614 --> 00:02:35.795\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Not true.\n\n55\n00:02:35.795 --> 00:02:36.872\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n56\n00:02:36.872 --> 00:02:38.872\nthat's what we are gonna talk about.\n\n57\n00:02:38.872 --> 00:02:42.920\nYeah, I shouldn't be remoting into my home\ncomputer, from work most of the time.\n\n58\n00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.280\nBut sometimes-\n&gt;&gt; But that's the truth.\n\n59\n00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:49.620\nWe're in the day and age where we can\ntake that 40 hour, a week employee,\n\n60\n00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.850\nand by utilizing these types of remote\ntechnologies, we can become more efficient\n\n61\n00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:59.500\nemployees whether it's necessarily a good\nthing socially, versus being productive.\n\n62\n00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.060\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, and\nI will tell you that it's also, I mean,\n\n63\n00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.520\nI shouldn't say this on camera.\n\n64\n00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:10.472\nIt's gonna be recorded for posterity's\nsake, but if I said that right.\n\n65\n00:03:10.472 --> 00:03:13.723\nI have been known to be sitting\non my couch on my laptop,\n\n66\n00:03:13.723 --> 00:03:18.053\nneeded something from my computer in\nthe office, and I remoted into it.\n\n67\n00:03:18.053 --> 00:03:18.553\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n68\n00:03:18.553 --> 00:03:19.306\n&gt;&gt; But yeah,\n\n69\n00:03:19.306 --> 00:03:22.255\nit saved me 20 steps.\nI didn't even have to get\n\n70\n00:03:22.255 --> 00:03:22.899\nup.\nAnyway,\n\n71\n00:03:22.899 --> 00:03:25.934\nthat's not what were here to talk about,\nnot Mike's laziness, what we\n\n72\n00:03:25.934 --> 00:03:29.540\nwant to talk about it is, how do we\nconfigure these remote desk top settings.\n\n73\n00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:30.520\nWhat do we have available?\n\n74\n00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:31.310\nHow do they work?\n\n75\n00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.850\nThings like that.\n\n76\n00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:34.200\nSo that's what we're\ngoing to take a look at.\n\n77\n00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.760\nSo remote desk top services,\nor RDS, by Microsoft.\n\n78\n00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:42.160\nIt actually used to be called terminal\nservices, way back in the day.\n\n79\n00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.850\nWe're not gonna go that far back, but\nremote desktop services is built in,\n\n80\n00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:47.130\nto Windows 10, right?\n\n81\n00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:51.040\nWe've got a client that we can fire up,\nMicrosoft Terminal Services Client,\n\n82\n00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.850\nwhich is what we use to make\nthat remote desktop connection.\n\n83\n00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:57.958\nIt's gonna open up a little dialogue box\nthat will then put in the information of\n\n84\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:04:01.536\nthe computer, that we're trying\nto connect to across the network.\n\n85\n00:04:01.536 --> 00:04:06.433\nAnd you are going to hopefully,\nauthenticate connect to that machine, and\n\n86\n00:04:06.433 --> 00:04:12.190\nbe presented, with that remote machine's\ndesktop, hence the name, remote desktop.\n\n87\n00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:16.507\nBasically what you're doing, is you're\ngrabbing that remote machine's desktop,\n\n88\n00:04:16.507 --> 00:04:18.339\nbringing it across the network, and\n\n89\n00:04:18.339 --> 00:04:20.897\ndisplaying it on your\nscreen wherever you're at.\n\n90\n00:04:20.897 --> 00:04:24.950\nAnd it's just like,\nyou were sitting at that remote computer.\n\n91\n00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:27.936\nYou have the desktop,\nyou have the start menu, the task bar,\n\n92\n00:04:27.936 --> 00:04:30.073\nall of the icons, all of the applications.\n\n93\n00:04:30.073 --> 00:04:33.847\nEverything on that machine,\nis available, all right?\n\n94\n00:04:33.847 --> 00:04:36.060\nHence the name, again, remote desktop.\n\n95\n00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:39.764\nAnd when we look at managing servers,\nor even other clients,\n\n96\n00:04:39.764 --> 00:04:43.270\nthere are many times we don't\nhave to use remote desktop.\n\n97\n00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:46.202\nLike that might be too much access.\n\n98\n00:04:46.202 --> 00:04:49.815\nIf Cherokee is my DNS admin,\nI might want her to manage DNS,\n\n99\n00:04:49.815 --> 00:04:53.087\nwhich is being hosted on\na server in my server closet.\n\n100\n00:04:53.087 --> 00:04:58.657\nI can make her a DNS admin, and we can add\nthe DNS console to her Windows 10 machine,\n\n101\n00:04:58.657 --> 00:05:01.733\nand point it to that DNS\nservice in the closet.\n\n102\n00:05:01.733 --> 00:05:04.809\nAnd she can remotely\nmanage DNS all day long.\n\n103\n00:05:04.809 --> 00:05:08.905\nDoesn't have access to anything else\non that server, just DNS, and so\n\n104\n00:05:08.905 --> 00:05:11.450\nthat's the way we really wanna go, right?\n\n105\n00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:14.090\nWe talk about limiting access,\n\n106\n00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:18.060\nonly providing access to what they\nneed to do their job and nothing more.\n\n107\n00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:19.920\nAnd, if she's just administering DNS,\n\n108\n00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:23.485\nshe doesn't need access to\nthe entire desktop, why?\n\n109\n00:05:23.485 --> 00:05:27.490\nCuz she could get into other things\nthat maybe she's not trained up on, or\n\n110\n00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:30.409\nI don't need her trying to access or\nmanage, right?\n\n111\n00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:33.385\nBut there are times,\nthere are certain things that we can do,\n\n112\n00:05:33.385 --> 00:05:35.745\nvia a Microsoft Management Console.\n\n113\n00:05:35.745 --> 00:05:41.541\nInstalling software, configuring settings\non that remote server for example.\n\n114\n00:05:41.541 --> 00:05:46.405\nThose kind of things are gonna require\nsome type of remote connection where\n\n115\n00:05:46.405 --> 00:05:51.207\nit can get access to the desktop, and\naccess everything on that machine.\n\n116\n00:05:51.207 --> 00:05:55.512\nAll right, so that's a little about\nRemote Desktop, why we use it,\n\n117\n00:05:55.512 --> 00:05:58.125\nwhere we might find it beneficial to use.\n\n118\n00:05:58.125 --> 00:06:01.864\nYou do wanna limit who's allowed to\nconnect, and we're gonna talk about\n\n119\n00:06:01.864 --> 00:06:05.314\nthe permissions required for\nRemote Desktop here in just a second.\n\n120\n00:06:05.314 --> 00:06:09.240\nBut let's start by,\nlet's just take at it real quick.\n\n121\n00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:12.790\nAll right, let's look at my screen here,\nso I'm on a Windows 10 machine.\n\n122\n00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:14.315\nI believe I'm on my client, yeah.\n\n123\n00:06:14.315 --> 00:06:18.480\nAnd I'm going to go to my Start Menu,\nand I can type in remote.\n\n124\n00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:21.273\nAnd you'll see right there\nat the top of my list,\n\n125\n00:06:21.273 --> 00:06:24.080\nis good ole Remote Desktop Connection,\nright?\n\n126\n00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:27.530\nEasy enough,\nold school peeps might Like MSTSC.\n\n127\n00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:31.750\n&gt;&gt; I always have to say it in my head\nto remember the letters for this one.\n\n128\n00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:34.708\n&gt;&gt; Do you do like Microsoft Terminal\nServices Client in your head?\n\n129\n00:06:34.708 --> 00:06:36.260\n&gt;&gt; Yes that's how I remember that.\n\n130\n00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:37.465\n&gt;&gt; That works right?\n&gt;&gt; Every time.\n\n131\n00:06:37.465 --> 00:06:38.550\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Cuz that's what\n\n132\n00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:41.630\nMSTSC notice remote desktop\nconnection comes up.\n\n133\n00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:44.932\nIf you're at a run line or\na command prompt you can type in MSTSC or\n\n134\n00:06:44.932 --> 00:06:48.069\nif you need a launch to remote\ndesktop with certain options.\n\n135\n00:06:48.069 --> 00:06:52.550\nYou might actually do it from a command\nline, or run dialogue and use that MSTSC.\n\n136\n00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:54.658\nThat's the name of the actual client.\n\n137\n00:06:54.658 --> 00:06:56.738\nAll right, so I'm gonna launch that,\n\n138\n00:06:56.738 --> 00:06:59.460\nand here's my remote\ndesktop connection client.\n\n139\n00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:01.527\nI'll zoom in so\nwe can get a good look at it.\n\n140\n00:07:01.527 --> 00:07:05.188\nAnd it is basic configuration just\nlike here when you launch it up.\n\n141\n00:07:05.188 --> 00:07:09.785\nI simply type in the name or\nIP address of the computer that I'm trying\n\n142\n00:07:09.785 --> 00:07:13.764\nto connect to, and\nI can click connect and it should allow.\n\n143\n00:07:13.764 --> 00:07:17.668\nSo let's try it, I'm gonna go dcO3\nthat's the name of my domain controller,\n\n144\n00:07:17.668 --> 00:07:18.729\nit's on my network.\n\n145\n00:07:18.729 --> 00:07:22.476\nAnd I'm gonna zoom out so\nwe can see what's going on, and\n\n146\n00:07:22.476 --> 00:07:24.282\nI'm gonna click connect.\n\n147\n00:07:24.282 --> 00:07:26.879\nRight, and it's gonna prompt me for\ncredentials.\n\n148\n00:07:26.879 --> 00:07:29.770\nAnd it's gonna use whatever\nI'm currently logged on as,\n\n149\n00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:32.552\nthose are gonna be the credentials\nthat it starts with.\n\n150\n00:07:32.552 --> 00:07:34.479\nI'm not stuck with that, right?\n\n151\n00:07:34.479 --> 00:07:37.680\nI might be on a machine that's\nnot part of the domain, or\n\n152\n00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:40.281\nlogged on with a different account, right?\n\n153\n00:07:40.281 --> 00:07:41.892\nIf we're doing best practices,\n\n154\n00:07:41.892 --> 00:07:45.296\nI've got my standard user account,\nthen I've got my admin account.\n\n155\n00:07:45.296 --> 00:07:49.153\nI'm logged on as my standard user, it\ndoesn't have permissions to remote desktop\n\n156\n00:07:49.153 --> 00:07:53.025\ninto the other main controllers, so maybe\nI can gotta provide other credentials.\n\n157\n00:07:53.025 --> 00:07:56.359\nThat's where this more choices option,\ncomes into play.\n\n158\n00:07:56.359 --> 00:08:01.356\nWe click that, I'll see the current user\nthat I am using, and then I can choose to\n\n159\n00:08:01.356 --> 00:08:06.132\nuse a different account And if I do that,\nit simply blanks out the names says,\n\n160\n00:08:06.132 --> 00:08:09.461\nall right, tell me,\nwho is it you want to connect as?\n\n161\n00:08:09.461 --> 00:08:13.050\nI'm gonna go back to my account,\ncuz that's the one I wanna use.\n\n162\n00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:16.010\nThere's also an option\nhere to remember me.\n\n163\n00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:19.250\nThis would remember the credentials\nthat you're using, so\n\n164\n00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:21.800\nthat you don't have to\nprovide them every time.\n\n165\n00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:23.190\nWe'll talk a little about that.\n\n166\n00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:27.060\nThere are some security\nconcerns associated with that.\n\n167\n00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:31.540\nIt's definitely easy, convenient, but\nwe know that convenience and security,\n\n168\n00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:37.050\nthey're typically on opposite ends of\nthat scale, right, or that balance point.\n\n169\n00:08:37.050 --> 00:08:38.970\nSo let me go ahead and\nauthenticate really quick.\n\n170\n00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:41.170\nAs I continue to babble on, and\n\n171\n00:08:41.170 --> 00:08:44.610\nwhat you'll see is I get this\nbar across the top of my screen.\n\n172\n00:08:44.610 --> 00:08:48.960\nAnd if I zoom in up there, didn't\nreally zoomed in at the bar, does it?\n\n173\n00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:53.470\nYou'll see, it does say DC03 and\nthis is server manager, right?\n\n174\n00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:57.452\nThis is, and if we zoom in on the contents\nhere, right, I'm connected to DC03.\n\n175\n00:08:57.452 --> 00:08:59.992\nI can do whatever I need to do,\n\n176\n00:08:59.992 --> 00:09:04.883\nI can minimize server manager,\nI can go to my start menu.\n\n177\n00:09:04.883 --> 00:09:08.760\nIf we go back over to server manager,\nfor example.\n\n178\n00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:10.480\nOops, I just launched it a second time.\n\n179\n00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:14.780\nI can go to my tools and launch up\nsay active director user computers or\n\n180\n00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:19.660\ngroup policy or DNS or\nwhatever it is that I need to do.\n\n181\n00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:22.762\nSo I am at the desktop for DCO3.\n\n182\n00:09:22.762 --> 00:09:27.870\nNow as I look, DCO3 is right here.\n\n183\n00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:32.553\nYou notice the screen is locked,\nbecause I've established a connection\n\n184\n00:09:32.553 --> 00:09:35.964\nremotely to this computer,\nand it locks the screen.\n\n185\n00:09:35.964 --> 00:09:40.115\nIf somebody was using this computer,\nit would give them the opportunity\n\n186\n00:09:40.115 --> 00:09:43.040\nto lock it, but\nit would end up knocking them off and\n\n187\n00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:46.530\nallowing me to create a remote\ndesktop session, all right?\n\n188\n00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:51.370\nBy default on servers and in fact here\nI'll show you, if I try to, we look.\n\n189\n00:09:51.370 --> 00:09:53.050\nThere's my remote desktop connection,\nright?\n\n190\n00:09:53.050 --> 00:09:56.230\nActive Directory users and\ncomputers is open.\n\n191\n00:09:56.230 --> 00:09:57.620\nLet's open up File Explorer.\n\n192\n00:09:57.620 --> 00:10:01.610\nFor example, go ahead and\nthrow that out there as well, all right.]?\n\n193\n00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:04.970\nI'm gonna flip back over\nto the machine DCO3 and\n\n194\n00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:08.730\nI'm gonna log in as\nthat same user account.\n\n195\n00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:14.270\nAnd you'll see I have active\ndirectory users and computers,\n\n196\n00:10:14.270 --> 00:10:16.810\nas well as File Explorer, open.\n\n197\n00:10:16.810 --> 00:10:20.760\nSo I've connected to that\nexisting session that I have.\n\n198\n00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:24.290\nIf I go back over to client one,\nit tells me,\n\n199\n00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:26.490\nmy remote desktop service\nsession has ended.\n\n200\n00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:29.450\nSomebody else kicked me\noff of this machine.\n\n201\n00:10:29.450 --> 00:10:29.950\nI click OK.\n\n202\n00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:35.740\nAnd if I connect again\nwith that same account,\n\n203\n00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:39.650\nI can connect right back\nin to that session.\n\n204\n00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:42.920\nThere's active directory and\nFile Explorer.\n\n205\n00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:45.870\nNow server operating systems by default,\n\n206\n00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:49.230\nit allows two remote desktop\nconnections at the same time.\n\n207\n00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:53.000\nMeaning that I could be remoted into\nthe server as well as Cherokee.\n\n208\n00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.040\nShe could be remoted into that server.\n\n209\n00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:56.440\nBut that's your limit.\n\n210\n00:10:56.440 --> 00:11:01.136\nTwo administrative remote desktop\nconnections are allowed simultaneously.\n\n211\n00:11:01.136 --> 00:11:04.920\nYou need more than that,\nwe've got to look at other technologies.\n\n212\n00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:09.416\nWe start using terminal services and\nwe need additional licensing and\n\n213\n00:11:09.416 --> 00:11:10.644\nthings like that.\n\n214\n00:11:10.644 --> 00:11:14.381\nOf the third administration typically,\nthis is plenty.\n\n215\n00:11:14.381 --> 00:11:18.350\n&gt;&gt; Okay, Mike, so\nit seems like it is pretty easy to use.\n\n216\n00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:20.600\nIs there anything we need to\nknow before we get started like,\n\n217\n00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:22.260\nany kind on configuration of settings?\n\n218\n00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:23.030\n&gt;&gt; There definitely is,\n\n219\n00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:25.760\na couple of more things I want to mention\nbefore we get there, though, Cherokee.\n\n220\n00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:26.540\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; I want to show\n\n221\n00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:29.220\nyou right now I'm remoted in,\nagain, to DC of 3.\n\n222\n00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:32.150\nWhen you disconnect,\nvery important to understand how\n\n223\n00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:35.370\nyou disconnect from the remote\ndesktop session, right?\n\n224\n00:11:35.370 --> 00:11:38.400\nBecause in fact, let me open up file\nexplorer again to leave it open,\n\n225\n00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:43.370\nif I simply close this window,\nmy remote desktop session.\n\n226\n00:11:44.590 --> 00:11:47.830\nAll right, it does give you a warning and\nwe need to read this.\n\n227\n00:11:47.830 --> 00:11:51.780\nPrograms on the remote computer will\ncontinue to run after you've disconnected.\n\n228\n00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:55.605\nYou can reconnect to this remote desktop\nsession later by logging on again.\n\n229\n00:11:55.605 --> 00:12:00.608\nAll right, so if I click OK,\nthe remote desktop session goes away.\n\n230\n00:12:00.608 --> 00:12:04.387\nIf I go back and\nI launch remote desktop again and\n\n231\n00:12:04.387 --> 00:12:08.271\nconnect one more time,\nwith that same account.\n\n232\n00:12:10.664 --> 00:12:12.545\nYou'll see File Explorer is still open.\n\n233\n00:12:12.545 --> 00:12:15.730\nAnd that could have been a process,\nlike a Windows Update that was running, or\n\n234\n00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:17.420\nan install, some software.\n\n235\n00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:21.520\nWhen you close this window,\nyou're not disconnecting your session.\n\n236\n00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:23.320\nThis is important to understand.\n\n237\n00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:27.890\nBecause of that limitation of two remote\ndesktop sessions, if I remote in and\n\n238\n00:12:27.890 --> 00:12:31.130\nthen just close my window, well,\nthat's just one partition tied up.\n\n239\n00:12:31.130 --> 00:12:34.760\nI'm not even using it, but\nthat's one remote session tied up.\n\n240\n00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:39.620\nCherokee later on modes in and closes\nher window, but doesn't log off either.\n\n241\n00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:42.720\nA third admin later on needs\nto get into that server and\n\n242\n00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:44.350\ndo something very important.\n\n243\n00:12:44.350 --> 00:12:47.750\nTries to remote desktop in,\ngonna get a warning that says, hey,\n\n244\n00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:51.930\nthe number of remote desktop connections\nhas been exceeded, please wait,\n\n245\n00:12:51.930 --> 00:12:54.780\nor disconnect some of the other sessions.\n\n246\n00:12:54.780 --> 00:12:56.010\nAnd this can cause a problem.\n\n247\n00:12:56.010 --> 00:12:59.450\nIf Mike and Cherokee have already gone\nhome, I've had this happen to me before\n\n248\n00:12:59.450 --> 00:13:02.430\nwhere I did not have physical\naccess to the server closet.\n\n249\n00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:06.316\nNeeded to remote into one of the servers\nto help set up a class, and it could not,\n\n250\n00:13:06.316 --> 00:13:09.980\nbecause two other people that have\nremote access have remoted in earlier.\n\n251\n00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:11.440\n&gt;&gt; They had those lingering sessions.\n\n252\n00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:12.380\n&gt;&gt; And just closed them.\n\n253\n00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:15.770\nDidn't bother to get rid of the session,\nand I couldn't get in.\n\n254\n00:13:15.770 --> 00:13:18.320\nI had to call somebody,\nbecause I had no physical access and\n\n255\n00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:21.200\nnothing else I could do, all right?\n\n256\n00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:25.620\nSo if you need to leave something running,\nlike let's say I logged in and\n\n257\n00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:28.830\nI did a software install or\nsomething, and I needed that to run,\n\n258\n00:13:28.830 --> 00:13:31.750\nor started some logging or something.\n\n259\n00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:33.910\nYou can close it, keep it running.\n\n260\n00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:36.410\nYou just have to keep in mind\nthat that session is still going.\n\n261\n00:13:36.410 --> 00:13:38.880\nIf you don't need whatever\nit is to continue running,\n\n262\n00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:41.180\nif you're truly done\nwith the remote desktop,\n\n263\n00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:47.890\nwhat you're supposed to do is go to your\nStart menu and actually sign out, right?\n\n264\n00:13:47.890 --> 00:13:51.440\nBy signing out, I'm killing that session.\n\n265\n00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:55.030\nIt's no longer active, just like I had\nsigned out from the physical machine.\n\n266\n00:13:55.030 --> 00:13:57.230\nSo if I go to log back in\nto the actual server now.\n\n267\n00:14:01.908 --> 00:14:02.628\nI'm logging in.\n\n268\n00:14:02.628 --> 00:14:04.970\nNotice server manager is launching up.\n\n269\n00:14:04.970 --> 00:14:08.600\nFile Explorer is not open,\nbecause it was like I logged off, and\n\n270\n00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:11.640\nI did, I logged off and\nnow I'm logging back on.\n\n271\n00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:15.320\nSo an important distinction there\nbetween closing your window and\n\n272\n00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:16.680\nactually logging off.\n\n273\n00:14:17.950 --> 00:14:19.680\nAll right, so\nlet's go back to Cherokee's question then.\n\n274\n00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:20.500\nSo a remote desktop,\n\n275\n00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:23.730\npretty straightforward,\nyou do need network access, right?\n\n276\n00:14:23.730 --> 00:14:27.180\nIf I don't have network access I'm not\ngonna be able to make that connection,\n\n277\n00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:28.740\nwhether that's across the WAN or\n\n278\n00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:32.580\non a LAN, I need to be able\nto connect to the machine.\n\n279\n00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:33.770\nI'm also going to need,\n\n280\n00:14:33.770 --> 00:14:39.040\nthe machine needs to be set-up to\naccept remote desktop connections and\n\n281\n00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:44.010\nI need to have permissions to create\nthat remote desktop session, all right?\n\n282\n00:14:44.010 --> 00:14:46.550\nIf I go to Server-1, oops, sorry.\n\n283\n00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:50.997\nIf I try to remote in to Server-1,\n\n284\n00:14:50.997 --> 00:14:55.013\n[SOUND], so let's say SVR01.\n\n285\n00:14:55.013 --> 00:14:59.942\nOkay, it's gonna wear and grind here and\ntry to connect, but it's not going to,\n\n286\n00:14:59.942 --> 00:15:04.730\nbecause I haven't setup server one\nto allow, that's what it says here.\n\n287\n00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:09.200\nIt doesn't know why, it's saying it\ncan't find server one, it doesn't exist.\n\n288\n00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:15.884\nActually, that's not the right error\n[LAUGH] let's just see if I can.\n\n289\n00:15:15.884 --> 00:15:16.604\n&gt;&gt; Talk to each other?\n\n290\n00:15:16.604 --> 00:15:20.486\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, being SVR01,\nnow that I think about it,\n\n291\n00:15:20.486 --> 00:15:23.449\nI might not have renamed that server.\n\n292\n00:15:27.489 --> 00:15:29.208\nLet's figure that out.\n\n293\n00:15:29.208 --> 00:15:30.891\nOkay, so there's DC03.\n\n294\n00:15:34.606 --> 00:15:41.447\nAnd SPR [INAUDIBLE] I\ntested it out earlier and,\n\n295\n00:15:41.447 --> 00:15:46.235\nI did enable his other connection.\n\n296\n00:15:46.235 --> 00:15:52.352\n[INAUDIBLE]\nCould not find SPR.\n\n297\n00:15:52.352 --> 00:15:53.850\nInteresting.\n\n298\n00:15:53.850 --> 00:15:56.250\nLet's do some quick troubleshooting here.\n\n299\n00:15:56.250 --> 00:15:58.942\nAgain, you need network connectivity,\nright, in order to do remote desktop.\n\n300\n00:15:58.942 --> 00:16:01.200\nSo we are going to verify that first.\n\n301\n00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:03.427\nSo if you were troubleshooting\na remote desktop connection.\n\n302\n00:16:03.427 --> 00:16:04.275\nWhy can't I connect?\n\n303\n00:16:04.275 --> 00:16:07.594\n&gt;&gt; Nate.\nWe'll test your network connectivity\n\n304\n00:16:07.594 --> 00:16:13.002\nfirst, 10.10.8.101 I\nthink is his IP address.\n\n305\n00:16:13.002 --> 00:16:14.031\n101.\n\n306\n00:16:18.805 --> 00:16:21.517\nAll right, so\nthat means I have got some DNS issues.\n\n307\n00:16:21.517 --> 00:16:24.140\nYou know what it is,\nI was testing some VPN stuff earlier.\n\n308\n00:16:24.140 --> 00:16:26.120\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And I bet you my DNS-\n\n309\n00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:27.325\n&gt;&gt; Like to tinker.\n\n310\n00:16:27.325 --> 00:16:32.863\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I bet you my DNS\nsettings have been goofed up.\n\n311\n00:16:32.863 --> 00:16:35.524\n&gt;&gt; But that's okay because we can\nconnect via a IP address as well.\n\n312\n00:16:35.524 --> 00:16:36.595\n&gt;&gt; We you can, absolutely.\n\n313\n00:16:36.595 --> 00:16:41.754\nNow, let me fix this real quick,\n\n314\n00:16:41.754 --> 00:16:48.952\n10.10.8 I don't know, 51, oops.\n\n315\n00:16:48.952 --> 00:16:53.641\n10.10.8.2, 10.10.8.203 is my domain\ncontroller, is also running DNS.\n\n316\n00:16:56.035 --> 00:17:00.693\nSo hopefully, sorry, I get a little\nclose happy with my windows here.\n\n317\n00:17:00.693 --> 00:17:03.920\nLet Windows catch up, but\nI should at this point be able to ping.\n\n318\n00:17:06.049 --> 00:17:09.285\nSBR01 by name, and we are good to go.\n\n319\n00:17:09.285 --> 00:17:14.862\nSo just a little DNS issue on\nmy laptop here or on my client.\n\n320\n00:17:14.862 --> 00:17:17.400\nAnd it's not responding,\nI have made it extremely mad.\n\n321\n00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:19.322\n&gt;&gt; You're just going so fast, Mike.\n\n322\n00:17:19.322 --> 00:17:22.694\n&gt;&gt; Try to close all the windows\nbefore its actually done.\n\n323\n00:17:22.694 --> 00:17:27.296\nSetting that up but that's okay\nwe can just ignore these I think.\n\n324\n00:17:27.296 --> 00:17:28.410\nAnd that one is not responding either.\n\n325\n00:17:28.410 --> 00:17:30.205\nGreat, really made it mad.\n\n326\n00:17:32.590 --> 00:17:35.302\nAll right, I'm going to ignore the\nEthernet properties that's not responding.\n\n327\n00:17:35.302 --> 00:17:39.384\nWe'll just tuck it off to the side there,\nand let Windows 10 worry about that.\n\n328\n00:17:39.384 --> 00:17:40.289\nThere it goes gone.\n\n329\n00:17:40.289 --> 00:17:40.909\nAll right, so\n\n330\n00:17:40.909 --> 00:17:44.550\nnow that I've got my connectivity I should\nbe able to type in the name of the server.\n\n331\n00:17:44.550 --> 00:17:45.990\nI click Connect.\n\n332\n00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:49.655\n&gt;&gt; And we're still expecting to fail,\nbut with the access error, correct?\n\n333\n00:17:49.655 --> 00:17:54.061\n&gt;&gt; Yes, this is gonna be a different error\nhopefully, something a little bit more\n\n334\n00:17:54.061 --> 00:17:57.367\nalong the lines of what we're\ntrying to demonstrate here.\n\n335\n00:17:57.367 --> 00:17:59.060\nSo it's gonna try, right?\n\n336\n00:17:59.060 --> 00:18:02.201\nIt's reaching out, at first,\nit queries DNS and says, hey,\n\n337\n00:18:02.201 --> 00:18:04.051\nwhat's the IP address of serv01?\n\n338\n00:18:04.051 --> 00:18:06.980\nIt gets that back and\nthen it attempts to make that connection.\n\n339\n00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:09.558\nIt tries and tries eventually\nit times out, and it says,\n\n340\n00:18:09.558 --> 00:18:13.178\nremote desktop cannot connect to the\nremote computer for one of these reasons.\n\n341\n00:18:13.178 --> 00:18:17.308\nEither the remote access to the server is\nnot enabled, or remote computer is turned\n\n342\n00:18:17.308 --> 00:18:20.378\noff, or the remote computer is\nnot available on the network.\n\n343\n00:18:20.378 --> 00:18:23.500\n&gt;&gt; So is this the normal or\nexpected default behavior?\n\n344\n00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:27.222\n&gt;&gt; This is, remote desktop services\nis not enabled by default,\n\n345\n00:18:27.222 --> 00:18:29.807\non our server operating systems, right?\n\n346\n00:18:29.807 --> 00:18:34.190\nNow, the client, and again, we gotta think\nof both sides, the client is enabled.\n\n347\n00:18:34.190 --> 00:18:37.297\nThe client is what I'm using to\nconnect to that remote machine, but\n\n348\n00:18:37.297 --> 00:18:40.147\nthat remote machine has to be\nlistening for that connection.\n\n349\n00:18:40.147 --> 00:18:43.728\nAnd told that it's okay to allow\nthat connection to come in.\n\n350\n00:18:43.728 --> 00:18:45.734\nAnd that's where enabling\nremote desktop comes in.\n\n351\n00:18:45.734 --> 00:18:47.680\nIt's not the client, the client is there.\n\n352\n00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:50.391\nWe can fire it up, and\ntype in an IP address anytime we want.\n\n353\n00:18:50.391 --> 00:18:52.991\nIt's the receiving computer,\nthe one we are trying to connect to.\n\n354\n00:18:52.991 --> 00:18:54.269\n&gt;&gt; Allowing access.\n\n355\n00:18:54.269 --> 00:18:56.087\n&gt;&gt; Yes, has that been configured?\n\n356\n00:18:56.087 --> 00:18:58.764\nSo DCO3, was,\nI set that up before class, so\n\n357\n00:18:58.764 --> 00:19:02.215\nthat I could show you what\na connection looked like.\n\n358\n00:19:02.215 --> 00:19:04.030\nServer01, I left it in the default.\n\n359\n00:19:04.030 --> 00:19:06.639\nSo let's go take a look,\nat what we got on Server 01.\n\n360\n00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:11.278\nAnd right here in Server Manager,\nI have switched to the local server blade.\n\n361\n00:19:11.278 --> 00:19:16.585\nAnd if I zoom in here, which I don't\nhave installed on this machine,\n\n362\n00:19:16.585 --> 00:19:23.000\nso I won't zoom in, we have our remote\ndesktop right there if you can see that.\n\n363\n00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.420\nAnd then it says disabled.\n\n364\n00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:29.750\nSo if I click on that, It's gonna\nopen up my system properties and\n\n365\n00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:32.600\nit leads me over to the remote tab.\n\n366\n00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:34.350\nSo you could get here any way you wanted.\n\n367\n00:19:34.350 --> 00:19:37.511\nIf you wanted to go to your system\nproperties from the Start menu,\n\n368\n00:19:37.511 --> 00:19:41.022\nfrom Control Panel, however,\nyou choose to get to system properties.\n\n369\n00:19:41.022 --> 00:19:45.721\nAnd then go to the Remote tab, and down\nhere at the bottom, choose an option, and\n\n370\n00:19:45.721 --> 00:19:47.534\nthen specify who can connect.\n\n371\n00:19:47.534 --> 00:19:52.330\nDon't allow remote connections\nto this computer is the default.\n\n372\n00:19:52.330 --> 00:19:55.300\nI change that to allow remote\nconnections to this computer,\n\n373\n00:19:55.300 --> 00:19:56.795\nand I'm gonna get a little pop-up.\n\n374\n00:19:56.795 --> 00:19:58.607\nBut again, I know this is small.\n\n375\n00:19:58.607 --> 00:20:03.830\nI tell you what, give me one second\nto make this better for everybody.\n\n376\n00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:11.140\nI've talked about it in many shows,\nI love my Zoom It.\n\n377\n00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:16.043\nSo we're going to drop that over here,\nand run this real quick Mr.\n\n378\n00:20:16.043 --> 00:20:18.242\nRuciniwicz and sys tunnels.\n\n379\n00:20:18.242 --> 00:20:22.448\n&gt;&gt; I don't really like this option that\nyour showing us here, Mike, because\n\n380\n00:20:22.448 --> 00:20:27.122\nthe actual operating system will take care\nof a lot of those things behind the scenes\n\n381\n00:20:27.122 --> 00:20:32.480\nthat we really don't need to worry about\nif we enable our remote desktop this way.\n\n382\n00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:34.630\nWe don't have to go through and check and\n\n383\n00:20:34.630 --> 00:20:39.280\nconfigure each individual firewall\nsettings on those rules manually.\n\n384\n00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:41.610\nSo this is actually a really\nnice way to be able to do that.\n\n385\n00:20:41.610 --> 00:20:43.010\n&gt;&gt; It is, it's very handy, right?\n\n386\n00:20:43.010 --> 00:20:44.920\nJust one click and we're done.\n\n387\n00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:46.940\nI will say sometimes you\nmight have to double check.\n\n388\n00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:50.482\nIf you turn this on and you find that\nyou cannot remote into it still,\n\n389\n00:20:50.482 --> 00:20:52.110\ndo check your firewall rules.\n\n390\n00:20:52.110 --> 00:20:52.727\n&gt;&gt; As a troubleshooting option.\n\n391\n00:20:52.727 --> 00:20:56.532\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, cuz I have seen once or\ntwice, very rarely,\n\n392\n00:20:56.532 --> 00:20:59.906\nwhere it failed to enable\nthe firewall rule.\n\n393\n00:20:59.906 --> 00:21:04.085\nNo big deal, you just go do it yourself\nand we'll talk about that here next.\n\n394\n00:21:04.085 --> 00:21:07.590\nBut this warning says, Remote Desktop\nFirewall exception will be enabled.\n\n395\n00:21:07.590 --> 00:21:09.652\nSo it's gonna open up that,\nas Cherokee said,\n\n396\n00:21:09.652 --> 00:21:11.986\nautomatically open that\nfirewall exception for me.\n\n397\n00:21:11.986 --> 00:21:14.116\nYou chose to enable remote\ndesktop connection for\n\n398\n00:21:14.116 --> 00:21:16.670\nall network connections on this computer.\n\n399\n00:21:16.670 --> 00:21:18.470\nThat's a key right there, right?\n\n400\n00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:21.400\nWe'll take a look at this rule but\nwhat it's saying, is all network\n\n401\n00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:25.420\nconnections on this computer, public,\nprivate, domain, all profiles.\n\n402\n00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:29.149\nMight not be what you want, most of the\ntime our server doesn't move a whole lot.\n\n403\n00:21:29.149 --> 00:21:32.884\nAnd it's not connecting to untrusted\nnetworks, but again, it might be\n\n404\n00:21:32.884 --> 00:21:37.005\nsomething that we wanna go and look at and\nbe a little more strict with our rules.\n\n405\n00:21:37.005 --> 00:21:40.360\nYes, I wanna allow this when the firewall\nsays it's on a domain profile,\n\n406\n00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:43.870\nbut not if the firewall thinks\nit's on public or private, right?\n\n407\n00:21:43.870 --> 00:21:45.540\nWe can always change that.\n\n408\n00:21:45.540 --> 00:21:48.933\nAnd it gives me a link right over to\nthe firewall if I wanna take a look at it.\n\n409\n00:21:48.933 --> 00:21:51.320\nIn fact, we'll click okay first.\n\n410\n00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:55.030\nAnother warning right behind that one,\n\n411\n00:21:55.030 --> 00:21:58.780\nit says this computer's set up to go to\nsleep or hibernation when not in use.\n\n412\n00:21:58.780 --> 00:22:04.380\nWhile the computer sleeps or hibernates,\nI cannot connect to it remotely, right?\n\n413\n00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:05.680\nKind of makes sense, right?\n\n414\n00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:10.017\nIf this machine goes to sleep,\nthen how can I connect to it, right?\n\n415\n00:22:10.017 --> 00:22:11.470\nHow do you log into it, it's asleep.\n\n416\n00:22:11.470 --> 00:22:13.102\nYou have to wake it up, and\n\n417\n00:22:13.102 --> 00:22:17.795\nthat would require other technologies\nof owners some kind of wake on land.\n\n418\n00:22:17.795 --> 00:22:19.290\nOr something like that.\n\n419\n00:22:19.290 --> 00:22:19.853\n&gt;&gt; Magic packets.\n\n420\n00:22:19.853 --> 00:22:23.020\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, magic packets and\nall that fun stuff.\n\n421\n00:22:23.020 --> 00:22:27.229\nSo it's warning me, hey look, you might\nwanna configure this machine to never go\n\n422\n00:22:27.229 --> 00:22:29.550\nto sleep,\nif you need to use remote desktop.\n\n423\n00:22:29.550 --> 00:22:34.622\nAnd most of our servers, typically in\na production environment, we do do that.\n\n424\n00:22:34.622 --> 00:22:36.008\nBut this is just my little test lab and\n\n425\n00:22:36.008 --> 00:22:38.220\nI haven't bothered setting\nup my power options.\n\n426\n00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:40.755\nSo it's just warning me there\nthat if it does go to sleep, or\n\n427\n00:22:40.755 --> 00:22:43.164\nif it's in hibernation,\nI won't be able to remote in.\n\n428\n00:22:43.164 --> 00:22:46.781\nAnd I'll get that same warning that\nI got before this was configured,\n\n429\n00:22:46.781 --> 00:22:50.778\ncuz the client doesn't really know why\nthe other machine is not responding.\n\n430\n00:22:50.778 --> 00:22:54.933\nIt's just saying, hey, either it's not\nenabled and the firewall is blocking me,\n\n431\n00:22:54.933 --> 00:22:57.990\nor it's not powered on, or\nit's not on the network, right?\n\n432\n00:22:57.990 --> 00:22:59.749\nIt doesn't really know why.\n\n433\n00:22:59.749 --> 00:23:04.147\nI'll zoom back out, actually I'm gonna\nzoom back in, just because it's fun.\n\n434\n00:23:04.147 --> 00:23:05.837\n&gt;&gt; For fun [LAUGH].\n\n435\n00:23:05.837 --> 00:23:10.170\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Down below where I chose allow\nremote connections to this computer.\n\n436\n00:23:10.170 --> 00:23:14.085\nAllow connections only from computers\nrunning remote desktop with network level\n\n437\n00:23:14.085 --> 00:23:16.297\nauthentication, and\nthat is recommended and\n\n438\n00:23:16.297 --> 00:23:18.918\nhonestly this hasn't been\nan issue since Windows XP.\n\n439\n00:23:18.918 --> 00:23:22.890\nI think XP supported a no Vista and\nlater supported it.\n\n440\n00:23:22.890 --> 00:23:25.728\nI don't know if a service pack\nadded that functionality to XP, but\n\n441\n00:23:25.728 --> 00:23:26.753\nthat doesn't matter.\n\n442\n00:23:26.753 --> 00:23:28.073\nThat's ancient history.\n\n443\n00:23:28.073 --> 00:23:32.762\nNetwork level authentication is when\nmy machine is identifying itself.\n\n444\n00:23:32.762 --> 00:23:37.216\nI'm asking that server hey prove to me you\nreally are who I think I'm connecting to.\n\n445\n00:23:37.216 --> 00:23:39.849\nIt gives me another layer of security.\n\n446\n00:23:39.849 --> 00:23:44.730\nIf it says allow connections only from\ncomputers running remote desktop.\n\n447\n00:23:44.730 --> 00:23:49.150\nSo my Windows 10 machine is gonna provide\nnetwork level authentication when it\n\n448\n00:23:49.150 --> 00:23:51.102\nattempts to connect to the server.\n\n449\n00:23:51.102 --> 00:23:53.410\nThe server is gonna allow it.\n\n450\n00:23:53.410 --> 00:23:55.938\nIf it doesn't provide that\nnetwork level authentication,\n\n451\n00:23:55.938 --> 00:23:58.523\nthen the server won't allow\nthe remote desktop connection.\n\n452\n00:23:58.523 --> 00:24:02.415\nBut I've got operating system that needs\nto be able to remote into this server, but\n\n453\n00:24:02.415 --> 00:24:04.762\ndoes not support network\nlevel authentication.\n\n454\n00:24:04.762 --> 00:24:09.700\nI would need to uncheck this box to\nallow those less secure Connections.\n\n455\n00:24:09.700 --> 00:24:13.364\nAll right,\nright next to that I have my Select Users.\n\n456\n00:24:13.364 --> 00:24:16.363\nAnd let me zoom, actually I'll\njust try to scroll up slowly so\n\n457\n00:24:16.363 --> 00:24:18.625\nit doesn't go across the screen,\nall right.\n\n458\n00:24:18.625 --> 00:24:22.473\nAnd this is where I can choose who's\nallowed to make those remote desktop\n\n459\n00:24:22.473 --> 00:24:23.300\nconnections.\n\n460\n00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:28.114\nEvery Windows machine client server has\na local group known as the remote desktop\n\n461\n00:24:28.114 --> 00:24:28.979\nusers group.\n\n462\n00:24:28.979 --> 00:24:33.924\nAnd that group is given permission\nby default to log on remotely\n\n463\n00:24:33.924 --> 00:24:38.600\nto the system,\nallowing that remote desktop connection.\n\n464\n00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:41.836\nSo if I want somebody to be able\nto remote into this machine,\n\n465\n00:24:41.836 --> 00:24:44.772\nI need to add them to that\nremote desktop users group.\n\n466\n00:24:44.772 --> 00:24:48.762\nNow, this is typically done\nthrough policy automatically.\n\n467\n00:24:48.762 --> 00:24:50.689\nWe're adding groups, not users, right?\n\n468\n00:24:50.689 --> 00:24:52.602\nI wouldn't add Cherokee to this.\n\n469\n00:24:52.602 --> 00:24:55.568\nI would add the help desk group\nthat Cherokee is a part of, and\n\n470\n00:24:55.568 --> 00:24:58.022\nI would use my restricted\ngroups in group policy.\n\n471\n00:24:58.022 --> 00:25:00.775\nI wouldn't do this individually\non each server most likely.\n\n472\n00:25:00.775 --> 00:25:04.082\nBut in a small shop right or\na place without a domain,\n\n473\n00:25:04.082 --> 00:25:08.232\nunderstand that every machine has\na remote desktop users group.\n\n474\n00:25:08.232 --> 00:25:09.578\nIt's a local group.\n\n475\n00:25:09.578 --> 00:25:12.796\nYou have to add people to it to\ngive them the ability to remote in.\n\n476\n00:25:12.796 --> 00:25:17.257\nYou also see that Lab Mike already has\naccess even though nobody is in that list,\n\n477\n00:25:17.257 --> 00:25:21.453\nand that's because the local\nadministrator's group automatically is in\n\n478\n00:25:21.453 --> 00:25:23.318\nthe remote desktop users group,\n\n479\n00:25:23.318 --> 00:25:26.263\nwhich means they have\npermission to log on locally.\n\n480\n00:25:26.263 --> 00:25:27.023\nActually, I take that back.\n\n481\n00:25:27.023 --> 00:25:28.542\nI don't think they're in that group.\n\n482\n00:25:28.542 --> 00:25:31.903\nThey've been given the right\nto log on remotely.\n\n483\n00:25:31.903 --> 00:25:32.817\nBut either way,\n\n484\n00:25:32.817 --> 00:25:36.679\nthe built in administrators group\ndoes have permission to remote in.\n\n485\n00:25:36.679 --> 00:25:41.208\nBecause I'm in the domain admins group,\nwhich is part of the local admins group,\n\n486\n00:25:41.208 --> 00:25:42.534\nI already have access.\n\n487\n00:25:42.534 --> 00:25:46.214\nBut if I wanted to give other people\naccess, I'd have to click Add.\n\n488\n00:25:46.214 --> 00:25:48.223\nI would find maybe my-.\n\n489\n00:25:48.223 --> 00:25:50.876\nI don't know what groups I have.\n\n490\n00:25:50.876 --> 00:25:52.268\nThe directors, right?\n\n491\n00:25:52.268 --> 00:25:56.599\nAnd now anybody that's in the directors\ngroup will be able to remote in.\n\n492\n00:25:56.599 --> 00:26:00.533\nIt'll add them to every remote\ndesktop users group, right?\n\n493\n00:26:00.533 --> 00:26:05.577\nAnd then we'll go ahead and click OK\nbecause that's all the settings I have for\n\n494\n00:26:05.577 --> 00:26:10.178\nconfiguring remote desktop from\nthe machine that I want to connect to.\n\n495\n00:26:10.178 --> 00:26:12.338\nI'll click OK and\nlet's take a look at the firewall.\n\n496\n00:26:12.338 --> 00:26:16.417\nCherokee, I know we're\na little short on time.\n\n497\n00:26:16.417 --> 00:26:19.202\nI'm gonna come over here and\nlook at my Advanced Settings.\n\n498\n00:26:19.202 --> 00:26:22.571\nOpen up that Windows firewall\nwith advanced security.\n\n499\n00:26:22.571 --> 00:26:25.971\nI'm gonna take a look at\nthe inbound rules, and\n\n500\n00:26:25.971 --> 00:26:30.393\nI'm going to scroll down a little bit and\nthen we'll zoom in.\n\n501\n00:26:30.393 --> 00:26:35.720\nAnd I can see remote desktop\nTCP-In right there is the rule\n\n502\n00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:42.475\nthat is allowing me to create these\nremote desktop sessions, all right.\n\n503\n00:26:42.475 --> 00:26:44.367\nNow, ooh, I gave it away darn it.\n\n504\n00:26:44.367 --> 00:26:46.195\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna close that real quick and\n\n505\n00:26:46.195 --> 00:26:46.776\nzoom back out.\n\n506\n00:26:46.776 --> 00:26:48.836\nCherokee, do you remember the port\nnumber that promotes that?\n\n507\n00:26:48.836 --> 00:26:49.492\n&gt;&gt; Yes, Mike.\n\n508\n00:26:49.492 --> 00:26:51.015\nThis is an easy one Mike.\n\n509\n00:26:51.015 --> 00:26:51.528\nIt's common.\n\n510\n00:26:51.528 --> 00:26:52.480\n3389.\n\n511\n00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:54.114\n&gt;&gt; 3389, exactly.\n\n512\n00:26:54.114 --> 00:26:58.158\nThat is the port number that\nremote desktop uses by default.\n\n513\n00:26:58.158 --> 00:27:00.215\nThat can be changed.\n\n514\n00:27:00.215 --> 00:27:01.493\nSecurity through obscurity.\n\n515\n00:27:01.493 --> 00:27:07.113\nMaybe you wanna change that port up\na little bit, but that is the port.\n\n516\n00:27:07.113 --> 00:27:09.247\nSo if we look in here and I zoom in.\n\n517\n00:27:09.247 --> 00:27:14.741\nInbound rule for the remote desktop\nserver to allow RDP traffic over 3389,\n\n518\n00:27:14.741 --> 00:27:15.899\nand is enabled.\n\n519\n00:27:15.899 --> 00:27:18.888\nAnd if we look at the-.\n\n520\n00:27:18.888 --> 00:27:22.479\nWhere is it?\n\n521\n00:27:22.479 --> 00:27:24.544\nI was trying to show you-\n&gt;&gt; Well, that brings up a good point.\n\n522\n00:27:24.544 --> 00:27:26.998\nI mean if you look at that it,\nis actually a protocol.\n\n523\n00:27:26.998 --> 00:27:30.634\nIt's not just a technology\nthat Microsoft created.\n\n524\n00:27:30.634 --> 00:27:32.746\nThis is not just centric to Microsoft.\n\n525\n00:27:32.746 --> 00:27:35.225\nRemote desktop can be used\nin other systems also.\n\n526\n00:27:35.225 --> 00:27:38.812\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, things like there's\nother third party apps that do\n\n527\n00:27:38.812 --> 00:27:40.942\nremote desktop sessions as well.\n\n528\n00:27:40.942 --> 00:27:42.679\nAnd there you can see what I\nwas talking about earlier.\n\n529\n00:27:42.679 --> 00:27:44.717\nIt is all three profiles, right?\n\n530\n00:27:44.717 --> 00:27:48.273\nSo when it enables that rule for\nyou, it does all three.\n\n531\n00:27:48.273 --> 00:27:50.287\nSo you might wanna come in here and\nchange that.\n\n532\n00:27:50.287 --> 00:27:54.078\nIf you have other network adaptors on\nthat server that are connected to public\n\n533\n00:27:54.078 --> 00:27:55.785\nnetworks or something like that.\n\n534\n00:27:55.785 --> 00:27:59.762\nMaybe it's a VPN server, direct\naccess server, multiple connections.\n\n535\n00:27:59.762 --> 00:28:02.430\nOne of them is going out to\nthe public side might not want\n\n536\n00:28:02.430 --> 00:28:05.915\nthose remote desktop connections to\ncome across that public network.\n\n537\n00:28:05.915 --> 00:28:08.685\nSo you could definitely change\nthat up if you need to.\n\n538\n00:28:08.685 --> 00:28:12.513\nBut now that we've gone through and\nenabled it, and so I've enabled it,\n\n539\n00:28:12.513 --> 00:28:15.119\nwhich means basically\nallowing the connection.\n\n540\n00:28:15.119 --> 00:28:17.289\nOpened up the port in the firewall and\n\n541\n00:28:17.289 --> 00:28:21.777\nmade sure I was in the group that has\npermissions, let's see what happens.\n\n542\n00:28:21.777 --> 00:28:23.355\nFlip back over to the client.\n\n543\n00:28:23.355 --> 00:28:26.907\nConnect to server 1, authenticate.\n\n544\n00:28:26.907 --> 00:28:29.285\n&gt;&gt; We're already past\nthe point that we were before.\n\n545\n00:28:29.285 --> 00:28:30.053\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n546\n00:28:30.053 --> 00:28:32.256\nYou're pretty sure that it's going\nto work at that point right.\n\n547\n00:28:32.256 --> 00:28:33.093\nAnd there we go.\n\n548\n00:28:33.093 --> 00:28:37.053\nAnd notice that because I'm using the same\naccount for both my sessions here,\n\n549\n00:28:37.053 --> 00:28:41.253\nthe remote session and the local session,\nyou can see the firewall is still open and\n\n550\n00:28:41.253 --> 00:28:43.177\nwhatever I was working with is there.\n\n551\n00:28:43.177 --> 00:28:44.397\nAnd I'm going to do the bad thing.\n\n552\n00:28:44.397 --> 00:28:48.211\nI'm going to close this session\ninstead of disconnecting.\n\n553\n00:28:48.211 --> 00:28:49.988\nAgain, I get that nice warning.\n\n554\n00:28:49.988 --> 00:28:52.311\nBecause that way I don't have to log\nback on when I go back over this.\n\n555\n00:28:52.311 --> 00:28:56.094\nWell, actually I do because the screen is\nlocked, so I'm really not saving any time\n\n556\n00:28:56.094 --> 00:28:58.622\nother than waiting for\nServer Manager to load up but eh.\n\n557\n00:28:58.622 --> 00:29:00.144\nThat's another story.\n\n558\n00:29:00.144 --> 00:29:04.598\nAll right, so that's a good look at\nthe basics of remote desktops as\n\n559\n00:29:04.598 --> 00:29:08.674\nfar as what it is, how we use it,\nand how we get it configured.\n\n560\n00:29:08.674 --> 00:29:12.275\nThere's still a lot of options that we\nneed to talk about with remote desktop,\n\n561\n00:29:12.275 --> 00:29:13.762\nbut we'll have to wait on that.\n\n562\n00:29:13.762 --> 00:29:14.925\n&gt;&gt; Okay, well it sounds like a plan.\n\n563\n00:29:14.925 --> 00:29:17.324\nHopefully we'll come back for\npart two here.\n\n564\n00:29:17.324 --> 00:29:18.552\nBut for now let's sign out.\n\n565\n00:29:18.552 --> 00:29:20.057\nI've been your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n566\n00:29:20.057 --> 00:29:20.777\n&gt;&gt; I'm Mike Roderick.\n\n567\n00:29:20.777 --> 00:29:23.948\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITPro.TV.\n\n568\n00:29:23.948 --> 00:29:29.753\n[MUSIC]\n\n569\n00:29:29.753 --> 00:29:32.550\nThank you for watching IT Pro TV.\n\n",

00:00:07.780\nyou live from San Francisco [CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:08.932\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.932 --> 00:00:12.000\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.096\n&gt;&gt; Welcome back to your Configure\nWindows Devices series, setting up for\n\n7\n00:00:16.096 --> 00:00:17.606\nthat 70-697 exam.\n\n8\n00:00:17.606 --> 00:00:18.990\nI'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n9\n00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.111\nAnd just as promised,\n\n10\n00:00:20.111 --> 00:00:24.359\nwe're back with the Part two to continue\nlooking at remote desktop connections, and\n\n11\n00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.310\nwe were able to go ahead and\nget Mike back in studios as well.\n\n12\n00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:29.130\nSo thanks for stopping by.\n\n13\n00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.545\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Actually,\nI can't get out of this shackle.\n\n14\n00:00:31.545 --> 00:00:33.330\nNo, I'm just kidding.\n\n15\n00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:34.998\nOf course I'm glad to be back and yeah,\n\n16\n00:00:34.998 --> 00:00:38.048\nwe've got a lot more to talk about\nwhen it comes to remote connections.\n\n17\n00:00:38.048 --> 00:00:42.282\nSpecifically what we're dealing with right\nnow, good old remote desktop services or\n\n18\n00:00:42.282 --> 00:00:42.982\nRDS, right?\n\n19\n00:00:42.982 --> 00:00:44.886\nAll right, so in our previous episode,\n\n20\n00:00:44.886 --> 00:00:47.410\nCherokee we took a look at\nsome of the basics, right?\n\n21\n00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:49.345\nWe talked about the concept, yeah.\n\n22\n00:00:49.345 --> 00:00:52.627\nHow to get it set up, how to make\nsure it was enabled on the other end,\n\n23\n00:00:52.627 --> 00:00:54.750\nto allow those remote connections.\n\n24\n00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.130\nTalked about the port number, which was-\n&gt;&gt; 3389.\n\n25\n00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.692\n&gt;&gt; 3389, right?\n\n26\n00:00:58.692 --> 00:01:02.373\nWe talked about who has\npermissions by default,\n\n27\n00:01:02.373 --> 00:01:05.430\nhow we can give people permission.\n\n28\n00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.016\nWe also talked a little bit about closing\nthose sessions versus logging off, and\n\n29\n00:01:10.016 --> 00:01:12.855\nsome of the repurcussions\nof doing both of those.\n\n30\n00:01:12.855 --> 00:01:14.210\n&gt;&gt; Mike will come find you.\n\n31\n00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:15.904\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I will.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n32\n00:01:15.904 --> 00:01:18.222\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, like I said, there are times,\n\n33\n00:01:18.222 --> 00:01:21.490\nmaybe you're the only admin and\nit doesn't matter.\n\n34\n00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:26.490\nYou can just close that window and leave\nthat session open, doesn't really matter.\n\n35\n00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.914\nBut in most shops where there's\nmultiple people doing administration,\n\n36\n00:01:31.914 --> 00:01:35.160\ngood idea to log off, not just disconnect.\n\n37\n00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:39.280\nOtherwise, again you tie up one\nof those available connections.\n\n38\n00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:44.258\nSomething else that I probably should\nmention along those same lines is powering\n\n39\n00:01:44.258 --> 00:01:45.140\noff, right?\n\n40\n00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.140\nEasy to do, easy to make a mistake there.\n\n41\n00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.874\nLet's remote into a machine real quick.\n\n42\n00:01:52.874 --> 00:01:58.270\nWe'll just do a remote desktop right back\nin the Server 01, you've seen this part.\n\n43\n00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:59.876\nNothing special here.\n\n44\n00:01:59.876 --> 00:02:04.045\nThere's my windows that are still open\nfrom the last time I connected, and\n\n45\n00:02:04.045 --> 00:02:08.470\nif I go to the Start menu, the way I'm\nsupposed to do this is to log off.\n\n46\n00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:09.787\nBut I do have my power button here.\n\n47\n00:02:09.787 --> 00:02:13.270\nAnd if I hit my power button,\nthere's disconnect is one option.\n\n48\n00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.726\nThat you don't normally see and\nthat's because I got a remote session, and\n\n49\n00:02:16.726 --> 00:02:19.912\ndisconnect will be just like clicking\non the X up there on my title bar of\n\n50\n00:02:19.912 --> 00:02:20.566\nthis remote.\n\n51\n00:02:20.566 --> 00:02:26.680\nThat's what I would do if I wanna leave\nsomething running under my user contacts.\n\n52\n00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.480\nRestart or Shut Down,\nthese are the normal things we would do.\n\n53\n00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.760\nWe would see on our Start menu.\n\n54\n00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:33.706\nHere's what you have to remember.\n\n55\n00:02:33.706 --> 00:02:35.481\nVery, very easy to do.\n\n56\n00:02:35.481 --> 00:02:39.514\nI might not be at this machine-\n&gt;&gt; This is actually really great advice\n\n57\n00:02:39.514 --> 00:02:43.362\nthat Mike's about to give you, so turn the\nvolume up because it's probably not gonna\n\n58\n00:02:43.362 --> 00:02:47.040\nbe on the exam, but in real world, it'll\nsave you from having egg on your face.\n\n59\n00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.457\n&gt;&gt; It darn sure will, because it's really\neasy to go here and say you know what,\n\n60\n00:02:50.457 --> 00:02:53.106\nI'm done, I'm just gonna go ahead and\nshut this guy down.\n\n61\n00:02:53.106 --> 00:02:57.690\n[SOUND] And go ahead and\nshut it down, right?\n\n62\n00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.530\nWhat you forget is,\nthat was a remote server.\n\n63\n00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.040\nThat's in a server closet on\nthe other side of the country-\n\n64\n00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.842\n&gt;&gt; 50 miles away or yeah,\n\n65\n00:03:04.842 --> 00:03:05.840\nthe other side of the country.\n\n66\n00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.240\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, another time zone,\nthere's nobody there physically.\n\n67\n00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:12.379\nNow I'm kinda in trouble.\n&gt;&gt; You gotta call the boss and say,\n\n68\n00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:14.312\ncan you drive to the remote branch?\n\n69\n00:03:14.312 --> 00:03:16.512\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And, or I'm driving in from home,\n\n70\n00:03:16.512 --> 00:03:19.665\nif this was maybe I was at home and\nthey called me up and\n\n71\n00:03:19.665 --> 00:03:23.050\nI remoted in and\ndid something to the server real quick.\n\n72\n00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:25.192\nAnd instead of hitting log off,\nI hit power off,\n\n73\n00:03:25.192 --> 00:03:27.870\nnow I'm driving into the office\nto turn that server back on.\n\n74\n00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:28.960\n&gt;&gt; Always restart.\n\n75\n00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:32.208\n&gt;&gt; Because the only way to do it is,\nunless you've got Wake-on-LAN\n\n76\n00:03:32.208 --> 00:03:35.984\ntype technology set up is to physically\nbe there and turn that server back on.\n\n77\n00:03:35.984 --> 00:03:40.660\nSo just a little gotcha,\nI wanted to warn you about is be careful.\n\n78\n00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:44.348\nEasy to do,\nyou lose track of what desktop you're on,\n\n79\n00:03:44.348 --> 00:03:48.210\nespecially if I unpin this title bar,\nthat bar up there.\n\n80\n00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:50.430\nIf I can get it to go away now.\n\n81\n00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.970\nThere it goes.\n\n82\n00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.850\nIt's easy to forget\nwhich machine you're on.\n\n83\n00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.219\nIf you have all the default backgrounds,\n\n84\n00:03:56.219 --> 00:03:57.810\nthis looks just like my\nWindows 10 background.\n\n85\n00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.925\nI'm not paying attention,\nI go to shut my laptop down and\n\n86\n00:04:01.925 --> 00:04:06.670\nI'm actually shutting down my\nremote connection to the server.\n\n87\n00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:09.965\nThat's somewhere else, so just\nsomething I wanted to point out there.\n\n88\n00:04:09.965 --> 00:04:11.380\nMake sure you're careful.\n\n89\n00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.488\nYou might want to restart it\nif you're doing an update.\n\n90\n00:04:13.488 --> 00:04:17.209\nWhat you gotta keep in mind is,\nis there anybody there,\n\n91\n00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:21.564\nif something goes wrong,\nthat can power that machine back on, or\n\n92\n00:04:21.564 --> 00:04:24.560\npower cycle it, or\nsee what the problem is?\n\n93\n00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:25.646\nSomething to keep in\nthe back of your mind.\n\n94\n00:04:25.646 --> 00:04:27.260\n&gt;&gt; That is really great advice.\n\n95\n00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:28.764\nMike, you know something else?\n\n96\n00:04:28.764 --> 00:04:33.384\nIf you are working with a lot of different\nmachines remotely, running a script\n\n97\n00:04:33.384 --> 00:04:37.444\nthat will put that machine name and\nIP address on the desktop and maybe\n\n98\n00:04:37.444 --> 00:04:42.070\nthat version of the OS or whatever just so\nthat it's an extra reminder for you.\n\n99\n00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:44.723\n&gt;&gt; I've done all kinds of things\nfrom taking paint, right?\n\n100\n00:04:44.723 --> 00:04:49.659\nThe program built in to Windows\n[CROSSTALK] Creating my own background,\n\n101\n00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:53.958\nthe screen and what solid color\nwith the word server one on it.\n\n102\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:56.254\nYou know there's a great program by,\n\n103\n00:04:56.254 --> 00:04:59.709\nagain I want to say Sysinternals\ncreated this, BG info.\n\n104\n00:04:59.709 --> 00:05:01.890\nStands for background information?\n\n105\n00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:02.548\n&gt;&gt; Yes, that's the one I was thinking of.\n\n106\n00:05:02.548 --> 00:05:06.469\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic little program that you\ncan set up to run automatically,\n\n107\n00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:10.525\nand it can put all kinds of information\nright on top of your wallpaper,\n\n108\n00:05:10.525 --> 00:05:14.750\nsuch as who am I logged on as,\nIP address, free disk space, processor.\n\n109\n00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:17.370\nBut amongst other things, name all right?\n\n110\n00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:19.642\nName of the computer you're connected to,\nthings like that.\n\n111\n00:05:19.642 --> 00:05:22.355\nSits right there in the corner or\nwherever you want on your desktop,\n\n112\n00:05:22.355 --> 00:05:25.610\nso definitely something to look into if\nyou have multiple connections going on.\n\n113\n00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:26.960\nEasy way to keep track.\n\n114\n00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:27.935\nVery good point there, Cherokee.\n\n115\n00:05:27.935 --> 00:05:32.912\n&gt;&gt; All right, so let's take a look, the\nnext thing I want to show you is when we\n\n116\n00:05:32.912 --> 00:05:37.099\nlooked at remote desktop we just\npretty much typed in the name or\n\n117\n00:05:37.099 --> 00:05:40.970\nIP address of the machine\nthat I want to connect to.\n\n118\n00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:43.599\nBut you'll notice there is\nthis Show Options down here,\n\n119\n00:05:43.599 --> 00:05:46.245\nso that means there are more\nthings that I can configure.\n\n120\n00:05:46.245 --> 00:05:48.209\nLet's take a look.\n\n121\n00:05:48.209 --> 00:05:53.922\nGo Show Options and wow, really opens up\na lot of different settings available.\n\n122\n00:05:53.922 --> 00:05:58.080\nThe first one right here on the screen,\nlet's zoom in.\n\n123\n00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:01.143\nAll right, is the computer name and\nwho I'm connecting as, and\n\n124\n00:06:01.143 --> 00:06:03.696\nthat's cuz I had already\ntyped that into the box, and\n\n125\n00:06:03.696 --> 00:06:07.070\nthen below it says you'll be asked for\ncredentials when you connect.\n\n126\n00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:09.920\nBelow that, Allow me to save credentials.\n\n127\n00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:14.940\nI can check this, and this will allow me\nto, it's not gonna do it automatically but\n\n128\n00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:19.478\nit'll give me the option now to save\nmy credentials with this connection.\n\n129\n00:06:19.478 --> 00:06:21.160\nGood and bad to that, right?\n\n130\n00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:25.207\nIf you're using your logon as one account,\nyou're using a different account to make\n\n131\n00:06:25.207 --> 00:06:28.930\nthis remote connection, saving those\ncredentials can definitely be handy.\n\n132\n00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:31.895\nBut it also means if somebody\nelse has physical access,\n\n133\n00:06:31.895 --> 00:06:34.580\nif somebody gains access to your laptop,\nright?\n\n134\n00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:36.473\nYou leave it at Starbucks or\n\n135\n00:06:36.473 --> 00:06:41.674\nyou've left it open at a conference\nhall somewhere, somebody sits down.\n\n136\n00:06:41.674 --> 00:06:43.174\nIf they can double click on it,\n\n137\n00:06:43.174 --> 00:06:47.290\nnow they're connected as you to whatever\nmachine you had this connection set up to.\n\n138\n00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:50.810\nSo it's definitely\nsomething to keep in mind.\n\n139\n00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:53.490\nLike I said, it's not a huge security\nrisk, but there's that potential.\n\n140\n00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:55.810\nAnd it might be against policy.\n\n141\n00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:59.560\nMake sure you think about your company\npolicies as you're choosing these options.\n\n142\n00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:01.330\nI'm gonna uncheck that.\n\n143\n00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:04.406\nI've already decided it's really not that\nbig of a deal to type in a password.\n\n144\n00:07:04.406 --> 00:07:08.700\nI know they're long and complex but\nthat's what security is about.\n\n145\n00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:09.700\n&gt;&gt; Right,\nall those little layers add up, right?\n\n146\n00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:14.007\n&gt;&gt; All right, so, next thing\ndown here at the bottom is Save,\n\n147\n00:07:14.007 --> 00:07:16.510\nSave as and Open, all right?\n\n148\n00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:21.267\nOpen would allow me to browse and\nfind another RDP dialogue, and\n\n149\n00:07:21.267 --> 00:07:24.450\nI'll show you what I\nmean here in a second.\n\n150\n00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:26.590\nSave and Save As.\n\n151\n00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:28.600\nBe real careful with the Save, right?\n\n152\n00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:30.460\nIf I'm gonna zoom out for just a second,\n\n153\n00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:32.730\nmy navigation is getting\na little wonky there.\n\n154\n00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:35.550\nIf I click Save, there is a default .rdp.\n\n155\n00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:39.532\nWhen you launch Remote Desktop Connection,\n\n156\n00:07:39.532 --> 00:07:44.370\nit's actually launching the default .rdp,\nright?\n\n157\n00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:44.911\nRdp.\n\n158\n00:07:44.911 --> 00:07:48.350\nThat's this guy right here.\n\n159\n00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:52.039\nAnd if I put anything in here, or\nconfigure any of these other options that\n\n160\n00:07:52.039 --> 00:07:55.742\nwe're gonna look at, and then click Save,\nthat becomes my new default.\n\n161\n00:07:55.742 --> 00:07:57.840\nSo every time I launch Remote Desktop,\n\n162\n00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:00.519\nit will already have all\nthose settings in there.\n\n163\n00:08:00.519 --> 00:08:01.919\nYou might want that.\n\n164\n00:08:01.919 --> 00:08:04.495\nI typically have different settings for\ndifferent connections,\n\n165\n00:08:04.495 --> 00:08:06.020\ndepending on what I'm connecting to.\n\n166\n00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:08.533\nSo I don't like overriding the default.\n\n167\n00:08:08.533 --> 00:08:11.090\nWhat I like to do is save as.\n\n168\n00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:12.010\nAnd, so I might do this.\n\n169\n00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:19.710\nI might say save as, and\nthen I'll dump it out on my desktop, oops.\n\n170\n00:08:19.710 --> 00:08:20.540\nDesktop.\n\n171\n00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:22.332\nAnd notice it says, default.rdp.\n\n172\n00:08:22.332 --> 00:08:27.243\nI'm gonna change this to svr01 and\nI'll click Save.\n\n173\n00:08:27.243 --> 00:08:32.409\nRight, and notice over here on my desktop,\nI have an icon for svr01.\n\n174\n00:08:32.409 --> 00:08:35.290\nAll right, and\nI could save this again for dco3.\n\n175\n00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:41.814\nSave as dco3, and\nI'll put that on my desktop.\n\n176\n00:08:41.814 --> 00:08:44.396\n&gt;&gt; So Mike,\nthat could come in really handy, like,\n\n177\n00:08:44.396 --> 00:08:47.350\nif there was a big problem\nthat you needed to extinguish.\n\n178\n00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:49.150\nWhat was that word for a fire?\n\n179\n00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:51.225\n&gt;&gt; You know, I forgot it already, so bad.\n\n180\n00:08:51.225 --> 00:08:54.538\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We had a word of the day, and\nwe were gonna lurk that into our show,\n\n181\n00:08:54.538 --> 00:08:55.210\nMike come on.\n\n182\n00:08:55.210 --> 00:08:56.340\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I forgot it.\n\n183\n00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:59.660\n&gt;&gt; Well, anyways, this is a quick,\neasy way to go ahead and access for\n\n184\n00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:02.100\ntroubleshooting, or,\ntaking care of problems.\n\n185\n00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:03.277\nYou know, rather quickly.\n\n186\n00:09:03.277 --> 00:09:05.169\n&gt;&gt; I remember one environment I worked at,\n\n187\n00:09:05.169 --> 00:09:09.020\nI was remoting into different servers\nall day, and I had a folder of these.\n\n188\n00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:10.910\nAnd I could just connect to whichever.\n\n189\n00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:15.670\nIf I wanted to connect to server one,\nI double-click on it, it opens it and\n\n190\n00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:17.590\nlaunches it, it goes ahead and\ntries to connect.\n\n191\n00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:20.500\nYou can see it here,\nit's gonna allow me to connect.\n\n192\n00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:24.175\nI still have to put credentials, because\nI didn't choose to save my credentials,\n\n193\n00:09:24.175 --> 00:09:27.270\nnotice there's a, Remember me dialogue or\ncheck mark that I can put,\n\n194\n00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:28.179\nthen I can connect.\n\n195\n00:09:28.179 --> 00:09:30.604\nI'm not gonna connect,\nwe've seen the connection,\n\n196\n00:09:30.604 --> 00:09:32.298\nI wanna talk about the other options.\n\n197\n00:09:32.298 --> 00:09:36.284\nSo just something you can do is you\ncan create additional RDP files.\n\n198\n00:09:36.284 --> 00:09:42.820\nDefault.rdp is in your Documents if I'm\nnot mistaken, and it is a hidden item.\n\n199\n00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:46.754\nSo as soon as I turned on I went to\nmy view, turned on hidden items.\n\n200\n00:09:46.754 --> 00:09:47.820\nThere's that default RDP.\n\n201\n00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:49.060\nAnd that's what I was saying.\n\n202\n00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:52.567\nIf you click save you're\noverriding the default.rdp.\n\n203\n00:09:52.567 --> 00:09:55.670\nSo maybe there are some settings you\nalways want every time you launch\n\n204\n00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:56.900\nremote desktop.\n\n205\n00:09:56.900 --> 00:09:58.995\nYou could save those in your default.rdp.\n\n206\n00:09:58.995 --> 00:10:02.392\n&gt;&gt; And then you could go ahead and\nput out those conflagrations.\n\n207\n00:10:02.392 --> 00:10:03.168\nYes.\n[LAUGH]\n\n208\n00:10:03.168 --> 00:10:04.435\n&gt;&gt; That was it, was that the word?\n\n209\n00:10:04.435 --> 00:10:07.270\nConflagrations.\n&gt;&gt; I'm not sure about the pronunciation.\n\n210\n00:10:07.270 --> 00:10:09.390\n&gt;&gt; Me neither.\nOkay.\n\n211\n00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:11.390\n&gt;&gt; We'll stick to IT stuff, okay.\n\n212\n00:10:11.390 --> 00:10:13.360\n&gt;&gt; Definitely not a vocab major here.\n\n213\n00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:14.650\nNot an English major.\n\n214\n00:10:14.650 --> 00:10:18.859\nAll right, so rather than double-click\non this, which is gonna launch it,\n\n215\n00:10:18.859 --> 00:10:23.492\nI can right-click on it, and choose Edit\nor properties, opens up the properties.\n\n216\n00:10:23.492 --> 00:10:26.680\nI wanna choose edit to make changes to it.\n\n217\n00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:30.158\nSo once you've created those,\nhow do I get back in and change settings?\n\n218\n00:10:30.158 --> 00:10:31.949\nRight-click, edit, all right?\n\n219\n00:10:31.949 --> 00:10:35.100\nWell let's go through\nthe rest of the options here.\n\n220\n00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:36.450\nWe talked about saving credentials.\n\n221\n00:10:36.450 --> 00:10:40.235\nOn the display, when you connect,\nhow does it launch?\n\n222\n00:10:40.235 --> 00:10:42.967\nMine is set to full screen,\nso when I connect,\n\n223\n00:10:42.967 --> 00:10:46.893\nit's going to take up my entire\nwindow here, I'll see nothing but\n\n224\n00:10:46.893 --> 00:10:50.880\nthat remote machine's desktop\noverlaying my desktop.\n\n225\n00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:55.350\nIf I slide this down,\nI could launch it in a window, right?\n\n226\n00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:59.845\nAnd my resolution on this lab,\nbecause of what we do with the streaming,\n\n227\n00:10:59.845 --> 00:11:01.406\nis really, really low.\n\n228\n00:11:01.406 --> 00:11:04.872\nBut if I choose 800 by 600 and\nclick connect,\n\n229\n00:11:04.872 --> 00:11:09.477\nthen we'll talk about some of those\nwarnings here in just a second.\n\n230\n00:11:09.477 --> 00:11:14.350\nNotice rather to launch full screen\nit launches in a window, right?\n\n231\n00:11:14.350 --> 00:11:18.748\nAnd I'm gonna close that connection and\ngo back in here and edit.\n\n232\n00:11:18.748 --> 00:11:20.180\nSo pretty straightforward there.\n\n233\n00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:22.920\nAnd not that I can't\nmaximize it once I connect.\n\n234\n00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:27.020\nSo choosing that display doesn't\nlock you in to that size.\n\n235\n00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:29.085\nIt's just that's how it's going to start,\nokay.\n\n236\n00:11:29.085 --> 00:11:33.720\nNow sometimes when I have my big\nmonitors back at my desk, and\n\n237\n00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:38.720\nthey're set to 1920 by 1080, I can launch\nremote desktop sessions at say 1080\n\n238\n00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:43.260\nx 720 I could have multiples on my\nwindows and it still looks pretty nice.\n\n239\n00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:46.030\nAll right there's also\na really cool option here.\n\n240\n00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:49.610\nUse all of my monitors for\nthe remote session.\n\n241\n00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:53.737\nWhen I'm at my desk here in the office,\nwhen I'm on my computer at home, I have\n\n242\n00:11:53.737 --> 00:11:57.758\ntwo extra monitors that I plug my laptop\ninto so I end up with three monitors.\n\n243\n00:11:57.758 --> 00:12:01.412\nBut when I remote into another machine,\nit's only on one window.\n\n244\n00:12:01.412 --> 00:12:05.590\nAll right then the other two monitors,\nI could be using for surfing internet or\n\n245\n00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:10.100\nwhatever, but sometimes when I remote into\na machine, I want more real estate, and\n\n246\n00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:11.480\nthat's what this allows me to do.\n\n247\n00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:13.798\nSay look,\nwhen I remote into this computer,\n\n248\n00:12:13.798 --> 00:12:16.726\ntake advantage of all the physical\nmonitors that I have,\n\n249\n00:12:16.726 --> 00:12:19.966\nfrom the machine I'm using to\nconnect to that remote machine.\n\n250\n00:12:19.966 --> 00:12:22.955\nSo then all of a sudden I can connect\nto that server in the closet, and\n\n251\n00:12:22.955 --> 00:12:25.484\nI can have windows on three\ndifferent monitors, right?\n\n252\n00:12:25.484 --> 00:12:27.765\nFantastic, love that feature.\n\n253\n00:12:27.765 --> 00:12:31.946\nDown below, color quality, really just\nsaving a little bit of bandwidth and\n\n254\n00:12:31.946 --> 00:12:35.613\nnowadays it's not that bad, but\nyou can change the color quality,\n\n255\n00:12:35.613 --> 00:12:39.985\nthat connection bar, that blue bar that we\nsee across the top that I unpinned just\n\n256\n00:12:39.985 --> 00:12:44.293\na little bit ago, that's where if you\nwanna see that when it's in full screen,\n\n257\n00:12:44.293 --> 00:12:46.390\nand that's a good little reminder.\n\n258\n00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:47.395\nOne that you're in\na remote desktop session.\n\n259\n00:12:47.395 --> 00:12:48.389\n&gt;&gt; For sure.\n\n260\n00:12:48.389 --> 00:12:51.965\n&gt;&gt; And\nyou which machine you're connected to,\n\n261\n00:12:51.965 --> 00:12:54.983\nso I like that bar that shows up there.\n\n262\n00:12:54.983 --> 00:12:59.347\nAll right, on the local resources,\nconfigure remote audio settings.\n\n263\n00:12:59.347 --> 00:13:01.050\nDo I want sound?\n\n264\n00:13:01.050 --> 00:13:04.715\nLet's say I'm remoted into that server,\nand it's trying to play a beep or\n\n265\n00:13:04.715 --> 00:13:08.554\nan alarm or some kind of sound, do I want\nthose sounds played on this computer,\n\n266\n00:13:08.554 --> 00:13:09.561\nmy laptop, right?\n\n267\n00:13:09.561 --> 00:13:14.030\nSo the sound would be streamed back\nacross the connection to my laptop here.\n\n268\n00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:16.658\nDo not play the sound at all, or\nplay it on the remote computer,\n\n269\n00:13:16.658 --> 00:13:19.103\nwhich is really fun if you\nknow somebody's sitting near.\n\n270\n00:13:19.103 --> 00:13:20.482\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I was going to say,\nif you're pranking someone.\n\n271\n00:13:20.482 --> 00:13:21.850\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n272\n00:13:21.850 --> 00:13:25.530\nMost of our servers don't have speakers\nhooked up to everything like that anyway.\n\n273\n00:13:25.530 --> 00:13:30.360\nBut, you can imagine the fun that can\nhappen on somebody's Windows 10 machine.\n\n274\n00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:32.340\n&gt;&gt; I wonder if we're evil if\nwe both were thinking that.\n\n275\n00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:33.125\n&gt;&gt; I think we are.\n\n276\n00:13:33.125 --> 00:13:34.869\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Anyway.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's bad.\n\n277\n00:13:34.869 --> 00:13:37.740\nAll right,\nsame thing with remote audio recording.\n\n278\n00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:40.150\nDo not record, record from this computer.\n\n279\n00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:41.980\nSo maybe I'm opening something up.\n\n280\n00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:44.756\nAgain, for server management,\nthis doesn't make a lot of sense.\n\n281\n00:13:44.756 --> 00:13:48.502\nWe don't have microphones,\nwe don't have speakers hooked up.\n\n282\n00:13:48.502 --> 00:13:50.600\nWe're not typically using Cortana.\n\n283\n00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:55.540\nBut if I'm remoting into my Windows 10\nmachine from home, maybe I used some\n\n284\n00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:59.956\napplication that I need to speak to,\nor need to hear the sounds from.\n\n285\n00:13:59.956 --> 00:14:02.904\nSo those options are there for you.\n\n286\n00:14:02.904 --> 00:14:05.840\nBelow that Keyboard,\nApply Windows key combinations.\n\n287\n00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:09.813\nSo when I do like Windows key E,\nWindows key R, or Windows key L,\n\n288\n00:14:09.813 --> 00:14:12.328\nwhere's that key stroke being sent to?\n\n289\n00:14:12.328 --> 00:14:15.159\nAnd the default is only\nwhen using the full screen.\n\n290\n00:14:15.159 --> 00:14:19.198\nSo if my remote session is full screen,\nand I do a Windows key R,\n\n291\n00:14:19.198 --> 00:14:22.343\nthe run dialogue opens up\non the remote session.\n\n292\n00:14:22.343 --> 00:14:27.097\nIf I'm not full screen though,\nif it's a window, like 1280 by or\n\n293\n00:14:27.097 --> 00:14:31.530\nwhatever, not full screen,\nthen T stroke combinations would be\n\n294\n00:14:31.530 --> 00:14:36.228\nsent to the machine I'm using,\nthe one I'm physically sitting at.\n\n295\n00:14:36.228 --> 00:14:40.120\nBut you can say, always on this computer,\nor always on the remote computer.\n\n296\n00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:44.740\n&gt;&gt; I think it's a good setting right there\nwhen it's full screen because at least\n\n297\n00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:46.330\nI would expect that.\n\n298\n00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:49.310\nAnd when it's smaller, it makes sense.\n\n299\n00:14:49.310 --> 00:14:49.980\n&gt;&gt; It does, right?\n\n300\n00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:54.041\nAnd if you got more than one\nwindow size or RDP session,\n\n301\n00:14:54.041 --> 00:14:59.709\nI could Alt Tab between them and things\nlike that if my keyboard is captured.\n\n302\n00:14:59.709 --> 00:15:00.968\nBelow that though- so\n\n303\n00:15:00.968 --> 00:15:05.290\nthose two, I don't change those very\noften, the defaults are pretty good.\n\n304\n00:15:05.290 --> 00:15:10.930\nBut below that I've got some really\nhandy options here local devices and\n\n305\n00:15:10.930 --> 00:15:14.570\nresources choose the devices and\nresources that you want to use,\n\n306\n00:15:14.570 --> 00:15:18.980\nin your remote sessions by default\nprinters and clipboard, is connected.\n\n307\n00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:21.793\nWhat this is saying is, local device and\n\n308\n00:15:21.793 --> 00:15:25.202\nresources that I wanna\nuse in my remote session.\n\n309\n00:15:25.202 --> 00:15:28.370\nSo here I am on my desk at work,\nI remote into a server, and\n\n310\n00:15:28.370 --> 00:15:32.928\nI open up the configuration for some\napplication that I'm troubleshooting, and\n\n311\n00:15:32.928 --> 00:15:35.056\nneeded a hardcopy of those settings.\n\n312\n00:15:35.056 --> 00:15:36.363\nSo I click print.\n\n313\n00:15:36.363 --> 00:15:39.050\nRight, on that remote session.\n\n314\n00:15:39.050 --> 00:15:39.987\nWhere does it print out?\n\n315\n00:15:39.987 --> 00:15:41.252\nDoes that server,\n\n316\n00:15:41.252 --> 00:15:45.610\nif it wanted to print to a printer\nthat is sitting right next to me.\n\n317\n00:15:45.610 --> 00:15:48.163\nRight, my laptop has\na printer right next to it.\n\n318\n00:15:48.163 --> 00:15:50.690\nBut I'm clicking print\non that remote server.\n\n319\n00:15:50.690 --> 00:15:53.547\nAnd that server doesn't have\na printer hooked up to it, right.\n\n320\n00:15:53.547 --> 00:15:59.241\nAnd this allows me to bring my printer\nalong with me into that remote session.\n\n321\n00:15:59.241 --> 00:16:02.938\nBring my clipboard along with\nme into that remote session, so\n\n322\n00:16:02.938 --> 00:16:07.914\nthat I can use the printer that's attached\nto my laptop while I'm connected to that\n\n323\n00:16:07.914 --> 00:16:11.480\nserver that's in Timbuktu or\nwherever, right?\n\n324\n00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:14.950\nAnd if I click More,\nI'll see there's lots of other options.\n\n325\n00:16:14.950 --> 00:16:18.100\nSmart cards, that's enabled by default.\n\n326\n00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:21.700\nAs we see more and\nmore smart card authentication being used,\n\n327\n00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:25.830\nwhen I connect to that server, if I has\nto use a smart card to gain access,\n\n328\n00:16:25.830 --> 00:16:29.590\nI've got a reader here, but\nI'm not physically at that machine.\n\n329\n00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:32.040\nBut I can use my reader here,\nplug in my card,\n\n330\n00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:36.700\nmy or whatever it is, and\nuse that against the remote machine.\n\n331\n00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:40.800\nSame thing with ports, drives,\nthis is a really handy one.\n\n332\n00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:43.610\nWhen you remote into a machine,\n\n333\n00:16:43.610 --> 00:16:46.890\nwhat if I want to grab some\nfiles off of that machine?\n\n334\n00:16:46.890 --> 00:16:49.320\nI can't just drag them off of\nmy remote desktop window and\n\n335\n00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:51.980\ndrop them onto my local machine, right?\n\n336\n00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:56.310\nBut what I can do is bring\nmy local drive with me.\n\n337\n00:16:56.310 --> 00:16:57.530\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead and choose that so\n\n338\n00:16:57.530 --> 00:17:01.660\nwe can see what that option looks like\nwhen we make that connection, right?\n\n339\n00:17:03.430 --> 00:17:05.210\nDrives that I plug in later.\n\n340\n00:17:05.210 --> 00:17:07.550\nAnything you have currently plugged\nin will show up in this list and\n\n341\n00:17:07.550 --> 00:17:11.620\nyou can select it, including thumb drives,\nlike external media, things like that.\n\n342\n00:17:11.620 --> 00:17:16.040\nBut if you choose drives that plug in\nlater, maybe I remake the remote session,\n\n343\n00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:18.130\nbut then remember to\nplug in my thumb drive.\n\n344\n00:17:18.130 --> 00:17:19.988\nWell, it can still show\nup in my remote session.\n\n345\n00:17:19.988 --> 00:17:22.600\nOther supported plug-and-play devices,\n\n346\n00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:24.550\nif you have any others\nthat you want to bring.\n\n347\n00:17:24.550 --> 00:17:25.100\nAll right?\n\n348\n00:17:25.100 --> 00:17:26.660\nI'm gonna click, okay.\n\n349\n00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:28.240\nAnd let's go ahead and connect.\n\n350\n00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:32.340\nWe didn't go through all the settings yet,\nbut let's see what that looks like.\n\n351\n00:17:32.340 --> 00:17:33.102\nSo I click, Connect.\n\n352\n00:17:33.102 --> 00:17:36.230\nI'm gonna get this warning,\nand we saw this a minute ago.\n\n353\n00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:38.162\nI told you I'd explain it,\nso let's take a look at it.\n\n354\n00:17:38.162 --> 00:17:40.970\nThe remote connection could harm\nyour local or remote computer.\n\n355\n00:17:40.970 --> 00:17:43.990\nDo not connect unless you know\nwhere this connection came from or\n\n356\n00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:45.600\nhave used it before.\n\n357\n00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:49.461\nAnd the reason it's saying this is\nbecause I've chosen to bring along some,\n\n358\n00:17:49.461 --> 00:17:52.140\nlike in my case, that hard drive.\n\n359\n00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:55.199\nAnd so we start sharing these resources.\n\n360\n00:17:55.199 --> 00:17:58.661\nWell now there's a chance for other things\nthat we didn't want to share to get shared\n\n361\n00:17:58.661 --> 00:18:00.087\nbetween those machines, right?\n\n362\n00:18:00.087 --> 00:18:01.954\nIt's like shaking hands with somebody,\n\n363\n00:18:01.954 --> 00:18:04.790\nyou could be sharing a whole a lot\nmore than you were expecting.\n\n364\n00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:07.860\nViruses, things like that, right?\n\n365\n00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:09.410\nSame thing here and it's just warning me,\n\n366\n00:18:09.410 --> 00:18:12.800\nhey look, you're bringing you're local\ndrive, you're bringing your clipboard.\n\n367\n00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:15.870\nThat is a chance for\nthings to get shared back and forth.\n\n368\n00:18:15.870 --> 00:18:18.490\nAre you sure you trust that machine?\n\n369\n00:18:18.490 --> 00:18:21.920\nI click, show details, it'll show me,\nyeah, I'm bringing drives, printers, and\n\n370\n00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:24.950\nclipboard and I can change it right\nhere and there before I connect.\n\n371\n00:18:25.990 --> 00:18:28.480\nTypically, what I'll do is say,\ndon't ask me again for\n\n372\n00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:31.410\nconnections to this computer, because I\nconnect to this server all the time and\n\n373\n00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:32.890\nI get tired of this window popping up.\n\n374\n00:18:32.890 --> 00:18:34.050\nYes, I trust it.\n\n375\n00:18:34.050 --> 00:18:38.640\nYes, I understand the security\nimplications and don't warn me again.\n\n376\n00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:40.280\nThen I'll click, Connect.\n\n377\n00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:41.960\nAnd then it wants me to connect.\n\n378\n00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:43.579\nSo I'll type in, I'll authenticate.\n\n379\n00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:46.200\nAnd we will connect.\n\n380\n00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:48.920\nSo, now this is server-one's desktop.\n\n381\n00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:49.890\nRight?\nServer manager,\n\n382\n00:18:49.890 --> 00:18:51.760\nlet's open up server manager, just so\n\n383\n00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:55.480\nwe remember we're on the server,\nthis is not my local desktop.\n\n384\n00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:58.170\nAnd I'm gonna open up file\nexplorer on the server.\n\n385\n00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:02.430\nAnd so this server has a hard drive in it,\nSQL, right?\n\n386\n00:19:02.430 --> 00:19:07.744\nWith windows installed and all that good\nstuff but look what we have right here.\n\n387\n00:19:07.744 --> 00:19:12.510\nC on CLIENT01,\ndisk from remote desktop connection.\n\n388\n00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:16.800\nThat's my laptop or in this case,\nmy Windows 10 hard drive.\n\n389\n00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:20.210\nSo if there was a file,\nlet's say I had downloaded a driver and\n\n390\n00:19:20.210 --> 00:19:24.330\nI need to install it on that server,\nI downloaded it onto my client.\n\n391\n00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:27.400\nI can now come in here,\ngrab that file, and\n\n392\n00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:30.310\nlet me find something smaller than that so\nit doesn't take all day.\n\n393\n00:19:30.310 --> 00:19:34.790\nCopy it, I'm gonna right-click copy\ncuz you can't see me do Ctrl+V.\n\n394\n00:19:34.790 --> 00:19:39.620\nSo this is from the client machine, and\nthen on the server, I'm gonna paste it.\n\n395\n00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:44.310\nOr I could paste it somewhere\non the server's hard drive.\n\n396\n00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:45.764\nI could make a new folder base it.\n\n397\n00:19:45.764 --> 00:19:50.211\nThe point is I can now move things back\nand forth between my local machine and\n\n398\n00:19:50.211 --> 00:19:52.438\nthat remote machine.\n\n399\n00:19:52.438 --> 00:19:54.540\nEven if, well, I shouldn't say even if,\n\n400\n00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:58.100\ncuz we gotta be connected to have\nremote desktop connection, all right?\n\n401\n00:19:58.100 --> 00:20:02.870\nBut that makes it easy to move\nresources back [COUGH], excuse me.\n\n402\n00:20:02.870 --> 00:20:07.820\nBack and forth,\nbecause I can't do this, right?\n\n403\n00:20:07.820 --> 00:20:12.860\nI can't just take this file and\ndrag it onto my local machine's desktop.\n\n404\n00:20:12.860 --> 00:20:16.618\nI can't take something from my local\nmachine, see my big no symbol, and\n\n405\n00:20:16.618 --> 00:20:17.847\ndrag it on-\n&gt;&gt; That would be too easy, Mike.\n\n406\n00:20:17.847 --> 00:20:18.840\n&gt;&gt; A remote desktop connection.\n\n407\n00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:20.381\nThat would be way too easy, exactly.\n\n408\n00:20:20.381 --> 00:20:23.470\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But if I bring my drive,\n\n409\n00:20:23.470 --> 00:20:31.170\nwell now I could navigate to C on CLIENT,\nUsers,\n\n410\n00:20:31.170 --> 00:20:36.580\nMike, Desktop, and grab that whatever,\nin this case it was that rdp file.\n\n411\n00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:39.420\nDoesn't make a lot of sense,\nbut I can now copy it, right?\n\n412\n00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:42.380\nAnd I can drag that over to my desktop.\n\n413\n00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:44.387\nSee how that works, so\npretty cool option there.\n\n414\n00:20:44.387 --> 00:20:47.910\nIt'll bring local resources with us.\n\n415\n00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:51.150\nAll right, back into our options.\n\n416\n00:20:51.150 --> 00:20:55.170\nLet's do a, some more remote desktop here,\nexpand this back out.\n\n417\n00:20:56.720 --> 00:20:59.970\nSo that was our display,\nwe looked at local resources.\n\n418\n00:20:59.970 --> 00:21:01.970\nI didn't talk about printers,\nbut same thing.\n\n419\n00:21:01.970 --> 00:21:07.220\nBecause my windows 10 machine has\na printer, when I connect to that server,\n\n420\n00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:08.890\nI could have printed from that server.\n\n421\n00:21:08.890 --> 00:21:11.860\nI could have opened up a document,\nand clicked print, and\n\n422\n00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:12.900\nit would have said, I see.\n\n423\n00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:13.810\nYou do have a printer,\n\n424\n00:21:13.810 --> 00:21:16.410\neven though there's no printer\nactually connected to that server.\n\n425\n00:21:17.530 --> 00:21:22.580\nAll right, experience, honestly nowadays\nthis doesn't affect us too much,\n\n426\n00:21:22.580 --> 00:21:25.170\nbut I do get spoiled sometimes.\n\n427\n00:21:25.170 --> 00:21:29.030\nI'm used to having good high-speed\nconnectivity everywhere I go.\n\n428\n00:21:29.030 --> 00:21:32.895\nThis allows me to control the quality,\nright?\n\n429\n00:21:32.895 --> 00:21:36.060\nI can say look,\nI'm on a really slow connection.\n\n430\n00:21:36.060 --> 00:21:39.100\nIt's about 15, 16 megabits per second.\n\n431\n00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:43.290\nAnd as soon as I hit that drop down list,\nsome of these check marks were unchecked.\n\n432\n00:21:43.290 --> 00:21:47.330\nIf I put this back to LAN,\nnotice all of these are checked.\n\n433\n00:21:47.330 --> 00:21:50.380\nSo the drop down list is just a quick\nway to check and uncheck these,\n\n434\n00:21:50.380 --> 00:21:51.840\nthey're basically templates.\n\n435\n00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:54.660\nYou can also manually check and\nuncheck these.\n\n436\n00:21:54.660 --> 00:21:56.970\nThis does not limit your speed.\n\n437\n00:21:56.970 --> 00:21:59.890\nIf I choose low speed broadband,\n256 to 2 megs,\n\n438\n00:21:59.890 --> 00:22:04.970\nthis does not mean I'm gonna force\nthe connection to go that slow.\n\n439\n00:22:04.970 --> 00:22:08.820\nWhat's gonna happen is Windows\nis gonna optimize my experience\n\n440\n00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:11.900\nbased on the fact that I've told it\nI've got a really slow connection.\n\n441\n00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:13.070\nRather than sending,\n\n442\n00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:17.040\ndo I really need the background\nto be sent across the connection?\n\n443\n00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:20.250\nDo I need to see the contents of\nWindows while I'm dragging them around?\n\n444\n00:22:20.250 --> 00:22:21.790\nRight, you know what I'm talking about.\n\n445\n00:22:21.790 --> 00:22:22.820\nIf I drag this around,\n\n446\n00:22:22.820 --> 00:22:26.210\nnotice I can see the contents\ninside that window all the time.\n\n447\n00:22:26.210 --> 00:22:28.353\nInstead of getting that wire frame.\n\n448\n00:22:28.353 --> 00:22:32.352\n&gt;&gt; In a lot of videos,\nit's just that graphical like, aesthetic,\n\n449\n00:22:32.352 --> 00:22:34.035\nelements are nice to have.\n\n450\n00:22:34.035 --> 00:22:36.940\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and they're very nice to have,\nbut they can suck up bandwidth.\n\n451\n00:22:36.940 --> 00:22:40.650\nSo if you're on a slow connection,\nI would much rather turn off some of those\n\n452\n00:22:40.650 --> 00:22:43.920\npretty features and\nbe able to function on that machine.\n\n453\n00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:45.630\nSo that's all this is doing.\n\n454\n00:22:45.630 --> 00:22:51.140\nI get a lot of people that say,\nthat are afraid that if I drop this down\n\n455\n00:22:51.140 --> 00:22:53.610\nit's gonna limit my connection and\nthat's not what it's doing.\n\n456\n00:22:54.810 --> 00:22:56.060\nA couple more options down here.\n\n457\n00:22:56.060 --> 00:23:01.850\nA persistent bit map caching and\nreconnect if the connection is dropped.\n\n458\n00:23:01.850 --> 00:23:05.140\nBit map caching can actually\nspeed up performance.\n\n459\n00:23:05.140 --> 00:23:08.120\nRather than have to stream those\nimages across all the time,\n\n460\n00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:11.040\nit can cache them locally and\nI don't have to stream them.\n\n461\n00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:13.720\nReconnect if the connection is dropped,\nthat means if for\n\n462\n00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:16.310\nsome reason I lose\nconnectivity temporarily,\n\n463\n00:23:16.310 --> 00:23:20.350\nI lose my Remote Desktop session,\nit will attempt to reconnect.\n\n464\n00:23:20.350 --> 00:23:24.330\nYou'll actually see it saying, attempt\none of 20 or whatever the case maybe.\n\n465\n00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:26.570\nAll right.\n\n466\n00:23:26.570 --> 00:23:27.280\nI know we're getting short.\n\n467\n00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:29.780\nWe're almost out of tabs here, Cherokee.\n\n468\n00:23:29.780 --> 00:23:33.400\nOn the advanced,\nI have server authentication.\n\n469\n00:23:35.650 --> 00:23:38.270\nVerify that you are connecting\nto the intended remote computer.\n\n470\n00:23:38.270 --> 00:23:41.180\nRemember, we are verifying\nmy Windows 10 machine\n\n471\n00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:43.120\nwith that network level authentication.\n\n472\n00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:46.041\nBut here, what about the server\nthat I'm connecting to?\n\n473\n00:23:46.041 --> 00:23:50.961\nAnd my choices are, if the other\nend cannot verify his identity,\n\n474\n00:23:50.961 --> 00:23:52.311\nconnect anyway.\n\n475\n00:23:52.311 --> 00:23:55.162\nDon't warn me, just connect,\nI don't care, I don't like security,\n\n476\n00:23:55.162 --> 00:23:56.299\nsecurity is a waste of time.\n\n477\n00:23:56.299 --> 00:23:58.323\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right-\n\n478\n00:23:58.323 --> 00:24:00.324\n&gt;&gt; You guy's heard Mike say that, right?\n\n479\n00:24:00.324 --> 00:24:01.686\nI'm not the only one, okay?\n\n480\n00:24:01.686 --> 00:24:04.277\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You will feel like that\n\n481\n00:24:04.277 --> 00:24:06.438\nsometimes, if you're in the biz, I know.\n\n482\n00:24:06.438 --> 00:24:09.776\nWarn me, right,\nwhich means hey, prompt me,\n\n483\n00:24:09.776 --> 00:24:14.041\ntell me the other end is not verifying but\ngive me the choice.\n\n484\n00:24:14.041 --> 00:24:16.355\nConnect anyway because I know the server,\n\n485\n00:24:16.355 --> 00:24:20.286\nI understand why it's not able to\nauthenticate or verify its identity.\n\n486\n00:24:20.286 --> 00:24:22.647\nOr don't connect at all, right?\n\n487\n00:24:22.647 --> 00:24:24.307\nWhich means don't give me the choice.\n\n488\n00:24:24.307 --> 00:24:28.087\nIf the other end can't verify its\nidentity then don't connect, right?\n\n489\n00:24:28.087 --> 00:24:31.404\nThe default is warn me, so you'll get a\nprompt that says we can't verify the other\n\n490\n00:24:31.404 --> 00:24:32.857\nend, do you wanna connect anyway?\n\n491\n00:24:32.857 --> 00:24:34.506\nYou can say yes or no.\n\n492\n00:24:34.506 --> 00:24:38.365\nDown below that is my terminal\nservices gateway, or sorry,\n\n493\n00:24:38.365 --> 00:24:40.567\nremote desktop gateway, right.\n\n494\n00:24:40.567 --> 00:24:42.448\nIt's no longer terminal services.\n\n495\n00:24:42.448 --> 00:24:47.564\nAnd this is for when we're setting\nit up so that I can allow users to\n\n496\n00:24:47.564 --> 00:24:52.880\nremote into their machines at work\ntypically, many uses for this.\n\n497\n00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:56.479\nI shouldn't limit it to just that,\nbut here's what you gotta think about.\n\n498\n00:24:56.479 --> 00:25:00.793\nLet's say you go home and you want to\nremote into your computer at work.\n\n499\n00:25:00.793 --> 00:25:02.211\nWhat do you need?\n\n500\n00:25:02.211 --> 00:25:03.523\nYou need connectivity.\n\n501\n00:25:03.523 --> 00:25:05.619\nI'm connected to the Internet at home.\n\n502\n00:25:05.619 --> 00:25:09.259\nWork is connected to the Internet,\nso we're good, we got connectivity.\n\n503\n00:25:09.259 --> 00:25:13.571\nHopefully we have routing all that\ngood stuff, so I need connectivity.\n\n504\n00:25:13.571 --> 00:25:17.540\nI need the name or IP address of the\ncomputer that I'm trying to connect to.\n\n505\n00:25:17.540 --> 00:25:21.225\nNow my computer at work\nis behind a firewall.\n\n506\n00:25:21.225 --> 00:25:25.494\nIt's on a private network just like\nyour computer at work is most likely.\n\n507\n00:25:25.494 --> 00:25:29.211\nAnd if you look at your IP address it's\none of those private IP addresses non\n\n508\n00:25:29.211 --> 00:25:29.809\nroutable.\n\n509\n00:25:29.809 --> 00:25:34.543\nA 10.192168, a 17216 through 17231,\n\n510\n00:25:34.543 --> 00:25:37.615\nright, those private non routables.\n\n511\n00:25:37.615 --> 00:25:42.397\nAnd so if I tried from home to type\nin 1921682.45 that's not routable.\n\n512\n00:25:42.397 --> 00:25:48.279\nIt's not gonna go across the Internet and\nconnect to my computer at work.\n\n513\n00:25:48.279 --> 00:25:50.719\nThose are private non routable addresses.\n\n514\n00:25:50.719 --> 00:25:55.480\nSo how can I allow my users to connect\nto their machines at work from home\n\n515\n00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:59.836\nwithout having to go out and\nbuy a bunch of public IP addresses and\n\n516\n00:25:59.836 --> 00:26:01.872\nassign them their machines.\n\n517\n00:26:01.872 --> 00:26:04.092\nI can set up what's called\na remote desktop gateway.\n\n518\n00:26:04.092 --> 00:26:05.731\nNow this class isn't gonna cover that,\nright?\n\n519\n00:26:05.731 --> 00:26:10.374\nThat's a server side thing, but\nbasically it's a lot like a VPN server.\n\n520\n00:26:10.374 --> 00:26:11.261\nIt is really.\n\n521\n00:26:11.261 --> 00:26:14.181\nIt sits on the edge of the network and\nfrom home,\n\n522\n00:26:14.181 --> 00:26:17.685\nwhat I will do is I won't remote\ndirectly the IP address or\n\n523\n00:26:17.685 --> 00:26:20.975\nthe name that I type in from\nmy remote desktop client.\n\n524\n00:26:20.975 --> 00:26:25.022\nIt's not the, my work machine\nthat I'm trying to connect to.\n\n525\n00:26:25.022 --> 00:26:30.153\nI actually connect to the remote\ndesktop services gateway, right?\n\n526\n00:26:30.153 --> 00:26:33.278\nThat has a public IP address,\nit has two network adapters,\n\n527\n00:26:33.278 --> 00:26:37.044\none connected to the Internet,\none connected the local area network.\n\n528\n00:26:37.044 --> 00:26:41.891\nI will, from my house, connect to\nthat publicly facing network adapter\n\n529\n00:26:41.891 --> 00:26:46.579\non that remote desktop gateway service,\nand it will then translate or\n\n530\n00:26:46.579 --> 00:26:51.831\nallow me to connect to that internal\nmachine that has that private IP address.\n\n531\n00:26:51.831 --> 00:26:56.827\nVery much similar to the way you\nthink of NAT working, all right.\n\n532\n00:26:56.827 --> 00:27:02.172\nAutomatically detect RD gateway server\nsettings or use these settings.\n\n533\n00:27:02.172 --> 00:27:05.376\nAnd again I don't want to\ngo into the setup of this.\n\n534\n00:27:05.376 --> 00:27:07.385\nIt's not gonna be on\nthis exam most likely.\n\n535\n00:27:07.385 --> 00:27:08.673\nDefinitely not the setup.\n\n536\n00:27:08.673 --> 00:27:10.577\nBut I want you to understand what it is.\n\n537\n00:27:10.577 --> 00:27:15.356\nYour work you might have to support or\nconfigure or just understand to help\n\n538\n00:27:15.356 --> 00:27:20.075\nsupport a user that they don't connect\ndirectly to their work machine.\n\n539\n00:27:20.075 --> 00:27:24.992\nThey will typically go through a gateway\nand that's what they need to connect to.\n\n540\n00:27:24.992 --> 00:27:28.133\nSo you go in here you'll type\nthe name of the RD gateway.\n\n541\n00:27:28.133 --> 00:27:31.869\nAnd then, sorry, we'll zoom in there.\n\n542\n00:27:31.869 --> 00:27:33.733\nAnd then how do I want to log in?\n\n543\n00:27:33.733 --> 00:27:39.249\nBypass RD gateway for\nservers for local addresses.\n\n544\n00:27:39.249 --> 00:27:39.952\nI need to hit that.\n\n545\n00:27:39.952 --> 00:27:43.947\nIf I'm gonna manage that server from\nhome cuz maybe I'm on call 24/7.\n\n546\n00:27:43.947 --> 00:27:46.773\nAnd at 10 o'clock at night I've\ngotta remote into that server,\n\n547\n00:27:46.773 --> 00:27:48.142\nI'll go through that gateway.\n\n548\n00:27:48.142 --> 00:27:51.701\nBut when I'm at work, I don't want to go\nout to the Internet, into the gateway and\n\n549\n00:27:51.701 --> 00:27:54.349\ninto the server when I'm on\nthe same network as that server.\n\n550\n00:27:54.349 --> 00:27:58.753\nSo bypass RD gateway server for local\naddresses means if the address I type into\n\n551\n00:27:58.753 --> 00:28:02.971\nmy connection is on the same network\nas me, don't go through the gateway.\n\n552\n00:28:02.971 --> 00:28:06.635\nIf it's not, hit the gateway, all right.\n\n553\n00:28:06.635 --> 00:28:09.173\nAnd then your log on settings.\n\n554\n00:28:09.173 --> 00:28:12.948\nAnd this is another thing that\nyou'll have to be careful with,\n\n555\n00:28:12.948 --> 00:28:17.580\nyour credentials for connecting to\nthe RD gateway, and your credentials for\n\n556\n00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:22.088\nconnecting to your work machine could\nvery well be different, all right.\n\n557\n00:28:22.088 --> 00:28:29.624\nAnd when you set this up to connect to an\nRD gateway, it's not gonna let me do that.\n\n558\n00:28:29.624 --> 00:28:34.275\nThese credentials here are gonna be used\nto connect to the remote desktop gateway.\n\n559\n00:28:34.275 --> 00:28:36.261\nOnce you connect to that,\n\n560\n00:28:36.261 --> 00:28:42.148\ndo you want it to use the same credentials\nto connect to your remote computer?\n\n561\n00:28:42.148 --> 00:28:44.818\nOr do you wanna specify\ndifferent credentials, right?\n\n562\n00:28:44.818 --> 00:28:47.263\nYour company might have\none generic username and\n\n563\n00:28:47.263 --> 00:28:50.254\npassword that everybody uses\nto connect to the RD gateway.\n\n564\n00:28:50.254 --> 00:28:53.636\nAnd then once you're there, you've got to\nhave your specific credentials to connect\n\n565\n00:28:53.636 --> 00:28:56.617\nto the particular machine on the network\nthat you're trying to connect to.\n\n566\n00:28:56.617 --> 00:29:00.377\nSo that's what those options are for\nthere, all right?\n\n567\n00:29:00.377 --> 00:29:02.985\nAnd Cherokee,\nI think that's a pretty good, actually,\n\n568\n00:29:02.985 --> 00:29:04.911\nwe've got a couple minutes left, right?\n\n569\n00:29:04.911 --> 00:29:10.061\nCouple other things I do wanna mention.\n\n570\n00:29:10.061 --> 00:29:11.021\nYou know what we'll wait.\n\n571\n00:29:11.021 --> 00:29:11.619\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; We'll\n\n572\n00:29:11.619 --> 00:29:13.789\ncome back with another part cuz there's\ntoo many things I want to mention.\n\n573\n00:29:13.789 --> 00:29:15.934\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You're getting so\nexcited about this.\n\n574\n00:29:15.934 --> 00:29:18.282\n&gt;&gt; I don't want to rush through it.\n\n575\n00:29:18.282 --> 00:29:21.261\nThere're some other things they've added\nto remote desktop that I want to make\n\n576\n00:29:21.261 --> 00:29:21.845\nsure we cover.\n\n577\n00:29:21.845 --> 00:29:23.557\nSo let's just do another part.\n\n578\n00:29:23.557 --> 00:29:26.229\n&gt;&gt; Perfect, yeah so I guess there will\nbe a part three it looks like here.\n\n579\n00:29:26.229 --> 00:29:29.404\nSo hopefully you guys can join us for\nthat but for now let's sign out.\n\n580\n00:29:29.404 --> 00:29:31.028\nI've been your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n581\n00:29:31.028 --> 00:29:31.766\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n582\n00:29:31.766 --> 00:29:33.245\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n583\n00:29:33.245 -->

series.\n\n6\n00:00:14.476 --> 00:00:18.697\nI'm your host Cherokee Boose, in this\nepisode we'll continue taking a look at\n\n7\n00:00:18.697 --> 00:00:20.840\nhow to configure remote connections.\n\n8\n00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.912\nAnd with us today, back in studios,\nwe have Mr. Mike Roderick.\n\n9\n00:00:23.912 --> 00:00:24.976\nHow's it going today, Mike?\n\n10\n00:00:24.976 --> 00:00:26.476\n&gt;&gt; It's great, Cherokee,\nthanks for having me back.\n\n11\n00:00:26.476 --> 00:00:27.397\nAnd excited as always,\n\n12\n00:00:27.397 --> 00:00:29.421\nto continue talking about the- [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; I know,\n\n13\n00:00:29.421 --> 00:00:32.265\nI had to like make sure that we were\nlike sitting here on a part three\n\n14\n00:00:32.265 --> 00:00:35.661\nbecause we have been talking about this\nfor awhile now, a lot to look at here.\n\n15\n00:00:35.661 --> 00:00:38.709\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, who would have thought I could\nhave talked about remote desktop for\n\n16\n00:00:38.709 --> 00:00:39.480\nthree episodes?\n\n17\n00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:40.522\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Anybody who has watched\n\n18\n00:00:40.522 --> 00:00:43.675\nany of my other shows is probably\nthinking yeah, we know how you are Mike.\n\n19\n00:00:43.675 --> 00:00:44.284\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n20\n00:00:44.284 --> 00:00:47.140\nwhat are we gonna be looking\nat in this show Mike?\n\n21\n00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.980\n&gt;&gt; There's just a few more things\nto round out our remote desktop\n\n22\n00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.231\nconnection conversation\nthat I want to go over.\n\n23\n00:00:52.231 --> 00:00:56.060\n&gt;&gt; A couple of features they've added\nrecently to support Windows 10.\n\n24\n00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:00.086\nAnd then another cool little tool\nthat isn't specifically called out on\n\n25\n00:01:00.086 --> 00:01:03.719\nthe objective, but I wanted to\nshare with everybody if you want.\n\n26\n00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:04.780\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n27\n00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.641\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\nlet's just dive right back into my screen.\n\n28\n00:01:06.641 --> 00:01:08.843\nSo I have something to\nlook at other than me,\n\n29\n00:01:08.843 --> 00:01:11.930\nalthough actually there's\nprobably not a lot to show.\n\n30\n00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.510\nThe first thing I wanna talk about\nis what's called pen support.\n\n31\n00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:18.072\nAnd pen support is added to remote\ndesktop connection recently.\n\n32\n00:01:18.072 --> 00:01:20.300\nI say recently, it was Windows 10, but\n\n33\n00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.816\nWindow 10 is been out a little\nwhile at the time of this filming.\n\n34\n00:01:23.816 --> 00:01:28.280\nBut when we're talking about a pen,\nI'm talking about using a stylus.\n\n35\n00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:34.045\n&gt;&gt; And in today's world we have a lot of\ndevices that we use to connect remotely.\n\n36\n00:01:34.045 --> 00:01:37.290\nWe might be connecting I'm\nusing a laptop here, but\n\n37\n00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.071\nyou might be using a surface,\nright, a Microsoft surface.\n\n38\n00:01:41.071 --> 00:01:45.721\nSome kind of tablet, some other device\nwhere you're not using a mouse and\n\n39\n00:01:45.721 --> 00:01:50.086\na keyboard, to manipulate or\nwork with to interact with the system.\n\n40\n00:01:50.086 --> 00:01:54.550\nMaybe using a stylist,\nmaybe using some kind of a pen, all right,\n\n41\n00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:57.279\ncuz we know Windows 10 supports that.\n\n42\n00:01:57.279 --> 00:02:02.012\nAnd they've added the support\nto not only support the pen, but\n\n43\n00:02:02.012 --> 00:02:07.204\neven if those pen supports the,\nwhat is the term I'm looking for?\n\n44\n00:02:07.204 --> 00:02:09.220\nHow hard you're pushing?\n\n45\n00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:12.748\n&gt;&gt; Passive resistance?\n\n46\n00:02:12.748 --> 00:02:15.514\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they had like,\nI know there's a term.\n\n47\n00:02:15.514 --> 00:02:16.780\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, think of my head.\n\n48\n00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:17.561\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I can't do it but it's okay.\n\n49\n00:02:17.561 --> 00:02:19.829\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's not important that we understand\n\n50\n00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:21.648\nthat part, that's really not important.\n\n51\n00:02:21.648 --> 00:02:26.513\nWhat's important is we understand that\nthe remote desktop protocol supports it.\n\n52\n00:02:26.513 --> 00:02:30.686\nSo that if you're like in\nan art type application, and\n\n53\n00:02:30.686 --> 00:02:34.316\nthe harder you push the pin\nagainst the screen,\n\n54\n00:02:34.316 --> 00:02:38.144\nthe wider the line gets or\nthe darker the color is.\n\n55\n00:02:38.144 --> 00:02:39.390\n&gt;&gt; OK.\n&gt;&gt; Or anything like that.\n\n56\n00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:40.811\n&gt;&gt; But it's just heavier weight, so\n\n57\n00:02:40.811 --> 00:02:42.920\nI can make my artistic\nbrush strokes accordingly.\n\n58\n00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.267\n&gt;&gt; Yes, exactly, and honestly if\nyou're talking about managing servers,\n\n59\n00:02:47.267 --> 00:02:51.752\nit's probably not important to us at all\nbut for the exam This is a feature that\n\n60\n00:02:51.752 --> 00:02:56.170\nMicrosoft's added, and they love\nto quiz you on features like that.\n\n61\n00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.509\nSo understanding that remote\ndesktop one does support pen and\n\n62\n00:02:59.509 --> 00:03:02.473\nall of the functionality\nassociated with those pens.\n\n63\n00:03:02.473 --> 00:03:07.585\nBecause they know we're using many types\nof devices to do our remote desktop,\n\n64\n00:03:07.585 --> 00:03:09.320\nso very cool there.\n\n65\n00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:14.673\nWhen you're connecting from Windows\n10 to Windows 10 or to Server 2016,\n\n66\n00:03:14.673 --> 00:03:19.421\nthat's the only time those pen\nfunctionality is going to be supported.\n\n67\n00:03:19.421 --> 00:03:24.130\nAny down-level operating systems,\nwe lose that functionality, all right.\n\n68\n00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.071\nSo just know that for the exam.\n\n69\n00:03:26.071 --> 00:03:29.440\nThe other one I want to talk\nabout is the zoom capability.\n\n70\n00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.324\nThis is something that a lot of\npeople have wanted for a long time.\n\n71\n00:03:32.324 --> 00:03:35.364\nAnd it's not brand new but\nit's new enough to where one,\n\n72\n00:03:35.364 --> 00:03:37.570\nthey call it out in the objectives.\n\n73\n00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:40.235\nAnd it's something that they could\ndefinitely quiz you about and\n\n74\n00:03:40.235 --> 00:03:41.992\nsomething you might not be familiar with.\n\n75\n00:03:41.992 --> 00:03:46.680\nAnd the zoom, it allows you normally\nwhen you connect to a remote machine.\n\n76\n00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.814\nLet me go ahead and\nconnect over here to server one.\n\n77\n00:03:48.814 --> 00:03:54.580\nAlright, so I'm gonna connect and\nI've launched in full screen because\n\n78\n00:03:54.580 --> 00:04:01.105\nthat's the option I've chosen right in my\nMTSC or in my TSC, or my remote desktop.\n\n79\n00:04:01.105 --> 00:04:02.668\nWow, get dialogue box.\n\n80\n00:04:02.668 --> 00:04:04.030\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n81\n00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:05.535\n&gt;&gt; Sorry, brain cramp there.\n\n82\n00:04:05.535 --> 00:04:10.969\nAnd so I'm connected, and\nif I took a look at my display settings,\n\n83\n00:04:10.969 --> 00:04:15.820\ndisplay settings cannot be\nchanged from a remote session,\n\n84\n00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:18.940\nand my case it doesn't look that bad.\n\n85\n00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:21.687\nBut that's because I set all\nthis up very specifically for\n\n86\n00:04:21.687 --> 00:04:24.106\nwhat we do when we're filing these shows,\nright.\n\n87\n00:04:24.106 --> 00:04:27.843\nAll my resolutions pre-configured on\nall my machines, so I'm good to go.\n\n88\n00:04:27.843 --> 00:04:32.953\nThat's not always the case,\nif you're sitting at your work machine and\n\n89\n00:04:32.953 --> 00:04:35.150\nyou've got a big fat monitor.\n\n90\n00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:39.530\nAnd maybe you've got it set to,\nI don't know, 1920 by 1080 or\n\n91\n00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:43.618\neven higher, where some of these\nresolutions on these monitors.\n\n92\n00:04:43.618 --> 00:04:47.940\nAnd what you'll typically do is turn up\nthe scaling a little bit, cuz with that\n\n93\n00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:52.710\nhigh resolution, all our icons and\ntext and fonts start getting really small.\n\n94\n00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:56.398\nAnd so we'll turn up the scaling so that\nour icons scale up, our fonts scale up.\n\n95\n00:04:56.398 --> 00:05:01.486\nAnd then we go and remote into a computer\nlike a server or some other machine.\n\n96\n00:05:01.486 --> 00:05:05.317\nAnd all of a sudden that\nscaling goes away and we lose,\n\n97\n00:05:05.317 --> 00:05:10.620\neverything start getting really small and\nhard to navigate around.\n\n98\n00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:13.305\nI mean like teeny tiny, or it could be the\nopposite, it could get really big on you.\n\n99\n00:05:13.305 --> 00:05:17.247\nThe point is can't really change\nthe resolution, I can't click on\n\n100\n00:05:17.247 --> 00:05:21.555\nthe desktop and change that resolution,\nI'm stuck with it, all right.\n\n101\n00:05:21.555 --> 00:05:25.995\nThe zoom allows me to, and\nI'm going to come out of full screen so\n\n102\n00:05:25.995 --> 00:05:30.120\nthat I can get to this little\nicon right up here, all right.\n\n103\n00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:33.381\nAnd there's my zoom option right there.\n\n104\n00:05:33.381 --> 00:05:36.780\nAll right, let me zoom back out so\nyou can kinda see what I'm doing.\n\n105\n00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:42.254\nAgain, doesn't make much sense in my\nsituation because the resolution looks\n\n106\n00:05:42.254 --> 00:05:43.823\nfine, I wanna show you the option.\n\n107\n00:05:43.823 --> 00:05:48.568\nI go come in here, I can go to zoom, and\nit's set 100%, but I can change that.\n\n108\n00:05:48.568 --> 00:05:54.633\nLet's say I can go up to 200% and see how\neverything scales up, or I could go down.\n\n109\n00:05:54.633 --> 00:05:59.840\nI could go to 50%, and\neverything is teeny tiny.\n\n110\n00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:03.586\nSo the point of this little conversation\nis the fact that we can now kind\n\n111\n00:06:03.586 --> 00:06:04.995\nof control that, right.\n\n112\n00:06:04.995 --> 00:06:08.423\nWhich we couldn't do before and\nit was extremely annoying.\n\n113\n00:06:08.423 --> 00:06:12.116\nSo understand that feature is there, you\naccess it from your little menu right here\n\n114\n00:06:12.116 --> 00:06:14.450\nat the top of the remote\ndesktop connection window.\n\n115\n00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:17.604\nAnd you simply go to the menu and\nchoose your option.\n\n116\n00:06:17.604 --> 00:06:22.211\nSo if your resolution isn't looking\nright you can use that zoom to\n\n117\n00:06:22.211 --> 00:06:27.340\nkind of control the scaling of\nthat remote desktop session.\n\n118\n00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:29.632\nSo we have pen support,\nthat's a new feature.\n\n119\n00:06:29.632 --> 00:06:34.152\nWe've got the zoom,\nwhich is a relatively new feature as well.\n\n120\n00:06:34.152 --> 00:06:38.405\nAll right, the last thing I wanna\ntalk about is something known as\n\n121\n00:06:38.405 --> 00:06:41.123\nthe Remote Desktop Connection Manager.\n\n122\n00:06:41.123 --> 00:06:45.484\nAll right, so let me, I'm gonna bring\nthis out of full screen or actually,\n\n123\n00:06:45.484 --> 00:06:47.611\nlet me just minimize it for a second.\n\n124\n00:06:47.611 --> 00:06:52.450\nSo I've got one remote desktop connection\ngoing to server one down there.\n\n125\n00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:59.470\nI'm gonna launch another one,\ngo to DC3, and I'll connect as well.\n\n126\n00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:01.640\nAll right, so\nnow I've got another session.\n\n127\n00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:05.079\nIf I wanna flip back and\nforth between these session,\n\n128\n00:07:05.079 --> 00:07:09.988\nI minimize one, I come down here, and\nI switch to the other one, all right.\n\n129\n00:07:09.988 --> 00:07:12.616\nI wanna go back to the other one,\nI'm gonna minimize it.\n\n130\n00:07:12.616 --> 00:07:17.069\nOr if I try to, maybe I've got a really\nbig monitor, I could put these out\n\n131\n00:07:17.069 --> 00:07:21.157\nof full screen mode and try to\narrange them or something like that.\n\n132\n00:07:21.157 --> 00:07:26.299\nBut it can still be a little clunky, and\nespecially if I've got only one monitor\n\n133\n00:07:26.299 --> 00:07:30.401\nto work with on my machine that I'm using-\n&gt;&gt; Limited real estate.\n\n134\n00:07:30.401 --> 00:07:31.940\n&gt;&gt; Or limited real estate, yeah.\n\n135\n00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:37.467\nIt got a small screen, or it doesn't have\na high resolution or something like that.\n\n136\n00:07:37.467 --> 00:07:40.257\nIf I start doing three, or four, or\n\n137\n00:07:40.257 --> 00:07:44.260\nfive remote connections\nit can be really tedious.\n\n138\n00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:45.863\nWhen they're not full screen I\ncan do my Alt + Tab between them.\n\n139\n00:07:45.863 --> 00:07:49.986\nI had to switch from one or the other, but\n\n140\n00:07:49.986 --> 00:07:56.370\nwhen they are full screen,\nmy Alt + Tab is being sent.\n\n141\n00:07:56.370 --> 00:07:59.332\nTo the virtual machine, remember that\noption, for keyboard short cuts?\n\n142\n00:07:59.332 --> 00:07:59.969\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n143\n00:07:59.969 --> 00:08:03.404\n&gt;&gt; So ALT tab trying to tab between\nopen applications within the VM,\n\n144\n00:08:03.404 --> 00:08:05.100\nof which there are none.\n\n145\n00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:09.210\nAnd I can't switch to the other remote\ndesktop session I've got to come out\n\n146\n00:08:09.210 --> 00:08:14.000\nof full screen or I've gotta change\nmy options with the shortcuts, or\n\n147\n00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.502\nI've gotta just manually flip\nbetween one or the other.\n\n148\n00:08:16.502 --> 00:08:19.070\nAll right I'm gonna close these sessions.\n\n149\n00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:27.189\nMicrosoft gives us a tool called\nthe remote desktop connection manager.\n\n150\n00:08:27.189 --> 00:08:31.790\nSo I'm just jumping over to another\nWindows 10 box on the same network,\n\n151\n00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:34.480\npart of the same domain,\n[COUGH] excuse me.\n\n152\n00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:38.260\nAnd earlier I downloaded from\nMicrosoft this remote rdcman,\n\n153\n00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:43.131\nwhich is the remote desktop connection\nmanager free download from Microsoft,\n\n154\n00:08:43.131 --> 00:08:46.418\ndoesn't cost you anything,\nbut it's not built in.\n\n155\n00:08:46.418 --> 00:08:49.700\nYou run this, install,\nand it's extremely quick.\n\n156\n00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:54.409\nAnd once you install it,\nyou'll have this option right up here.\n\n157\n00:08:54.409 --> 00:08:58.303\nOops, I can't zoom into my desktop or\nmy start menu, really, but,\n\n158\n00:08:58.303 --> 00:09:00.464\nremote desktop connection manager.\n\n159\n00:09:00.464 --> 00:09:04.870\nAnd if I launch that,\nI get this beautiful white screen.\n\n160\n00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:05.898\n&gt;&gt; Looks exciting, right?\n\n161\n00:09:05.898 --> 00:09:07.612\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH].\n\n162\n00:09:07.612 --> 00:09:09.667\n&gt;&gt; All right, so basically what this is,\n\n163\n00:09:09.667 --> 00:09:13.983\nis it allows me to have multiple Remote\nDesktop connections, within one window.\n\n164\n00:09:13.983 --> 00:09:15.860\nMakes it very easy to work with.\n\n165\n00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:19.334\nSo what we'll do is go to Remote Desktops,\n\n166\n00:09:19.334 --> 00:09:23.009\nif I can get this guy to respond,\nthere we go.\n\n167\n00:09:23.009 --> 00:09:24.800\nSorry, that remote desktops first.\n\n168\n00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:29.180\nWe go to session first,\nsession, and then connect too.\n\n169\n00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:35.350\nAnd I get this dialog box, and\nI'm gonna to put in my server name,\n\n170\n00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:39.498\nlet's do dco3,\nprofiles you can start save as again.\n\n171\n00:09:39.498 --> 00:09:40.880\nThis one really isn't\ngonna be on the exams.\n\n172\n00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:43.466\nSo I don't wanna go into super detail,\nwith what you can and\n\n173\n00:09:43.466 --> 00:09:44.770\ncan't do with this console.\n\n174\n00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:48.230\nIt's more about I just wanna show you\nthis is available cuz they could ask you\n\n175\n00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:52.540\na question about managing multiple remote\ndesktops trying to promote their tool.\n\n176\n00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:56.167\nAll right, so I'm gonna put the name and\nserver in there, that's fine,\n\n177\n00:09:56.167 --> 00:09:58.975\nI've got some connection\nsettings that I can work with,\n\n178\n00:09:58.975 --> 00:10:02.094\nI wanna start a particular program,\na particular directory.\n\n179\n00:10:02.094 --> 00:10:05.690\nI wasn't using the default port numbers,\nthings like that.\n\n180\n00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:08.790\nAll right so I'll zoom back out and\nI'll go ahead and click connect.\n\n181\n00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.227\nAnd I have to authenticate as always,\ncuz I chose not to remember, and\n\n182\n00:10:14.227 --> 00:10:19.190\nthere we go, I now have my remote desktop\nsession, but it's inside this window.\n\n183\n00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:24.440\nAnd I can go to session,\nconnect to, and let's do svro1.\n\n184\n00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:30.083\nAuthenticate, and there we go.\n\n185\n00:10:30.083 --> 00:10:33.547\nThere is my server1's desktop.\n\n186\n00:10:33.547 --> 00:10:38.380\nAnd now, with my navigation tree over\nhere, I can flip back and forth,\n\n187\n00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:40.660\nbetween the servers.\n\n188\n00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:45.148\nAll right, so it allows me to consolidate\nand kind of make it easier to manage,\n\n189\n00:10:45.148 --> 00:10:47.260\nmultiple remote desktop sessions.\n\n190\n00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:49.080\nI really like this tool.\n\n191\n00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:52.840\nI don't know why it's not part of the OS,\nand might have to go and download it every\n\n192\n00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:56.870\ntime, but like I said, it's freely\navailable, so you can go out and grab it.\n\n193\n00:10:56.870 --> 00:10:59.180\nAnd there's a lot of other\noptions that you can do.\n\n194\n00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:02.670\nIf I want to create groups, or\n\n195\n00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:07.590\nautomatically connect every time I open up\nthis tool, it can automatically connect\n\n196\n00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:10.310\nto the three different servers\nthat I manage for example.\n\n197\n00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:13.837\nLet's say my job is to manage\nDNS in our environment.\n\n198\n00:11:13.837 --> 00:11:17.670\nAnd we've got three different DNS servers,\nthat I have to manage.\n\n199\n00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:21.390\nI can add all three of them here, create\na little group, setup automatic logons,\n\n200\n00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:23.242\nI can open this tool, and\n\n201\n00:11:23.242 --> 00:11:26.630\nbam bam bam, I've got all three\nremote desktop sessions there.\n\n202\n00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:30.765\nSo a lot really neat things\nyou can do with this.\n\n203\n00:11:30.765 --> 00:11:33.030\nJust thought I would show you that.\n\n204\n00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:37.214\nIf I can remote from,\nI wanna do some nested remoting.\n\n205\n00:11:37.214 --> 00:11:40.165\n&gt;&gt; Man.\n&gt;&gt; So let's see, from server 1,\n\n206\n00:11:40.165 --> 00:11:42.932\nI'm remoted it from server 1, and\n\n207\n00:11:42.932 --> 00:11:47.834\nI'm going to now remote\ninto dco3 through server 1.\n\n208\n00:11:47.834 --> 00:11:49.767\n&gt;&gt; Pretty cool.\n\n209\n00:11:49.767 --> 00:11:54.480\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's just geeky fun stuff,\nit's not actually useful at all.\n\n210\n00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:58.207\n&gt;&gt; But you can see my connection to dco3,\nwas dropped over here.\n\n211\n00:11:58.207 --> 00:12:00.710\nIn other words I got that I\nalready have a session active,\n\n212\n00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:03.990\nI'm using the same account,\nso let me close that.\n\n213\n00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:12.819\nJust goofing around, and then I can\njust reconnect to this guy again.\n\n214\n00:12:12.819 --> 00:12:18.827\nAll right and I think,\nthat pretty much covers remote desktop,\n\n215\n00:12:18.827 --> 00:12:21.510\nI'm gonna close that.\n\n216\n00:12:21.510 --> 00:12:27.071\nAnd actually, you know what,\nI'm gonna kill those sessions as well.\n\n217\n00:12:27.071 --> 00:12:30.343\nSo you can come over here and\nyou can say disconnect server,\n\n218\n00:12:30.343 --> 00:12:32.180\nyou could also log off of server.\n\n219\n00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:40.276\nEither way, log off would be logging off,\ndisconnect is leaving my session active,\n\n220\n00:12:40.276 --> 00:12:43.406\njust like we closed that\nRemote Desktop window.\n\n221\n00:12:43.406 --> 00:12:46.868\nAll right, I know we've got a little\nbit of time left, Cherokee, so there's\n\n222\n00:12:46.868 --> 00:12:50.436\none topic that's in this set of objectives\nthat, doesn't really seem to fit but\n\n223\n00:12:50.436 --> 00:12:53.713\nI'll go ahead and throw that in here\njust to kind of fill out this episode.\n\n224\n00:12:53.713 --> 00:12:54.871\n&gt;&gt; And what's that topic?\n\n225\n00:12:54.871 --> 00:12:56.080\n&gt;&gt; Broadband tethering.\n\n226\n00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:57.440\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Broadband tethering.\n\n227\n00:12:57.440 --> 00:12:58.237\nAll right, and\n\n228\n00:12:58.237 --> 00:13:01.914\nthis is something that a lot of us\nnowadays are probably familiar with,\n\n229\n00:13:01.914 --> 00:13:06.593\nthe idea behind broadband tethering, it's\nlike internet connection sharing, right?\n\n230\n00:13:06.593 --> 00:13:09.471\nIf I have one device,\nI have my Windows 10 device, and\n\n231\n00:13:09.471 --> 00:13:12.120\nthat device is connected to the internet.\n\n232\n00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:16.849\nThen I can allow other devices to\nconnect to my Windows 10 machine, and\n\n233\n00:13:16.849 --> 00:13:20.117\nthen through that machine\ngain internet access.\n\n234\n00:13:20.117 --> 00:13:25.975\nSo maybe for some reason I've got a phone,\nor a tablet, that can't connect directly,\n\n235\n00:13:25.975 --> 00:13:30.370\nI can make my, turn,\nbasically turn my laptop into a hotspot.\n\n236\n00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:31.130\n&gt;&gt; A hotspot.\n\n237\n00:13:31.130 --> 00:13:33.351\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nthat's really how you do it, right?\n\n238\n00:13:33.351 --> 00:13:35.350\nIs the connection sharing.\n\n239\n00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:39.646\nI can't show you on my VM's cuz my VM's\ndon't have a wireless adapter, I need\n\n240\n00:13:39.646 --> 00:13:44.220\na wireless adapter, because Cherokee's\nphone can't connect to my hotspot via.\n\n241\n00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:46.930\nYou're not gonna plug a cable into it or\nanything like that so\n\n242\n00:13:46.930 --> 00:13:47.980\nyou do need wireless.\n\n243\n00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:51.610\nAnd I'm gonna open up my network and\n\n244\n00:13:51.610 --> 00:13:56.480\ninternet settings, I could also go to\nmy gear icon from my start menu, and\n\n245\n00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:59.450\ngo into network and internet and\ngain access that way.\n\n246\n00:13:59.450 --> 00:14:05.216\nAnd then over here on my nav tree,\nthere's an option for mobile hotspot.\n\n247\n00:14:05.216 --> 00:14:08.845\nSo if I select that,\nthis is where I can turn it on or off and\n\n248\n00:14:08.845 --> 00:14:10.368\ncontrol the settings.\n\n249\n00:14:10.368 --> 00:14:14.964\nSo right up at the top is where I'll be\nable to share my internet connection with\n\n250\n00:14:14.964 --> 00:14:16.310\nother devices.\n\n251\n00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:18.220\nAgain, anything that has been\nworking with Windows for\n\n252\n00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:22.460\nsome time, remembers the good old ICS or\ninternet connection sharing.\n\n253\n00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:24.653\nThis is basically what you're-\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly what I was thinking\n\n254\n00:14:24.653 --> 00:14:26.426\nabout when you started\ntalking about this topic.\n\n255\n00:14:26.426 --> 00:14:29.160\n&gt;&gt; It's exactly what we're doing\nis we're just sharing that.\n\n256\n00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:30.570\nSo I can turn it on.\n\n257\n00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:38.607\nRight, and once I turn it on I have my,\nam I not connected?\n\n258\n00:14:38.607 --> 00:14:40.620\nLet me zoom back out here.\n\n259\n00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:42.100\nTurn that off for just a second.\n\n260\n00:14:43.870 --> 00:14:44.550\nThere we go.\n\n261\n00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:46.050\nI can't change this while it's turned on.\n\n262\n00:14:46.050 --> 00:14:46.660\nI wanted to show you.\n\n263\n00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:50.884\nIf I had more than one Internet\nconnection, because while they're gonna be\n\n264\n00:14:50.884 --> 00:14:55.108\nusing wireless to connect to my mobile\nhotspot, my laptop if that's with my\n\n265\n00:14:55.108 --> 00:14:58.756\nWindows 10 device could be\nconnected wired or wireless right?\n\n266\n00:14:58.756 --> 00:15:01.905\nI'm sharing my internet connection,\ndoesn't matter how I'm connected they're\n\n267\n00:15:01.905 --> 00:15:03.650\ngoing to connect wireless,\nI might be wired.\n\n268\n00:15:03.650 --> 00:15:05.380\nMost likely, I should be wired.\n\n269\n00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:06.522\nIf I'm gonna be sharing my internet\nconnection with other devices-\n\n270\n00:15:06.522 --> 00:15:07.279\n&gt;&gt; Right, just so\n\n271\n00:15:07.279 --> 00:15:09.920\nwe don't see any kind of\nperformance decrease.\n\n272\n00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:13.100\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, cuz if Cherokee's streaming\nsome video or something like that and\n\n273\n00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:16.603\nsomebody else is connected doing something\ncrazy, suck up all that bandwidth.\n\n274\n00:15:16.603 --> 00:15:19.770\nWe are sharing that connection, right?\n\n275\n00:15:19.770 --> 00:15:25.090\nSo you choose what connection you\nwanna share, you can click edit, here.\n\n276\n00:15:25.090 --> 00:15:28.400\nAnd obviously I did this a while ago for\nour demo, not highly secured.\n\n277\n00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:32.290\nI have got my favorite password in there,\nyou can name it.\n\n278\n00:15:32.290 --> 00:15:34.827\nI called it Mike's hotspot,\nI was creative.\n\n279\n00:15:34.827 --> 00:15:40.835\nI got my network password, don't use\nyour password for your machine, right?\n\n280\n00:15:40.835 --> 00:15:43.673\nProbably goes without saying, but let's\njust make sure we're on the same page.\n\n281\n00:15:43.673 --> 00:15:46.065\nDo not use your password.\n\n282\n00:15:46.065 --> 00:15:49.775\nThis is the password, think of it like\nwhen you setup your home wireless network.\n\n283\n00:15:49.775 --> 00:15:51.622\n&gt;&gt; When you're sharing this password.\n\n284\n00:15:51.622 --> 00:15:54.717\n&gt;&gt; Yes and you're gonna be giving this\npassword to other people That's gonna\n\n285\n00:15:54.717 --> 00:15:56.201\ncontrol whether they can connect.\n\n286\n00:15:56.201 --> 00:16:00.150\nYou don't wanna just open up your\nInternet connection for anybody.\n\n287\n00:16:00.150 --> 00:16:01.670\nSo you are gonna password protect it,\n\n288\n00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:05.210\nbut you don't want to be giving\nout your password that you use for\n\n289\n00:16:05.210 --> 00:16:09.350\nyour work machine or\nyour bank account or anything like that.\n\n290\n00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:12.005\nSo come up with something\nthat's secure but not yours.\n\n291\n00:16:12.005 --> 00:16:15.120\n[LAUGH] All right, and\nthen network bandwidth or\n\n292\n00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:16.970\nnetwork band, I can change that.\n\n293\n00:16:16.970 --> 00:16:18.443\nMy laptop is doing both.\n\n294\n00:16:18.443 --> 00:16:19.290\n2.4 and five,\n\n295\n00:16:19.290 --> 00:16:24.520\nso if I wanna limit this, I don't want\nany 2.4 gigahertz devices connecting.\n\n296\n00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:27.070\nI only want them connecting via five, or\n\n297\n00:16:27.070 --> 00:16:31.150\nmaybe I'm gonna keep those guys that are\nborrowing my connection down to 2.4 and\n\n298\n00:16:31.150 --> 00:16:34.800\nsave the five gigahertz band for\nmy own connection.\n\n299\n00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:37.410\nOr any available, all right?\n\n300\n00:16:37.410 --> 00:16:39.140\nAnd then you'll click save.\n\n301\n00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:42.280\nSo name it whatever you want,\nassign whatever password you want.\n\n302\n00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:43.880\nAnd then turn it on.\n\n303\n00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:46.680\nOnce it's turned on,\n\n304\n00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:51.790\nthis will show up when anybody else\nhas a device they can open up,\n\n305\n00:16:51.790 --> 00:16:55.540\nlook at their wireless networks that are\navailable, and they will see your hotspot.\n\n306\n00:16:55.540 --> 00:16:59.380\nThey're gonna see Mike's hotspot in\ntheir list of available connection.\n\n307\n00:16:59.380 --> 00:17:03.730\nI don't think it shows up in my own,\nthat would be kinda silly.\n\n308\n00:17:03.730 --> 00:17:05.960\nJust wanted to make sure it didn't.\n\n309\n00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:09.620\nActually I can see this is just turned on\nor off, that is not me connecting to it,\n\n310\n00:17:09.620 --> 00:17:15.520\ngives me quick access to turning it on or\nturning that off down there in my thing.\n\n311\n00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:18.680\nYeah, so I don't see Mike's hotspot,\nwhich is good because that wouldn't make\n\n312\n00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:19.780\nsense for me to connect my-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n313\n00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:21.644\n&gt;&gt; So, yeah. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; If you were,\n[LAUGH] sharing it.\n\n314\n00:17:21.644 --> 00:17:26.918\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right, and\nI can see it's limited to eight devices,\n\n315\n00:17:26.918 --> 00:17:31.420\nI got zero of eight currently connected,\nall right.\n\n316\n00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:36.770\nThere was another option that I was gonna\nshow you, that has disappeared on me.\n\n317\n00:17:36.770 --> 00:17:39.310\nWe're gonna turn this off,\nand I think it'll come back.\n\n318\n00:17:41.170 --> 00:17:42.090\nThere we go.\n\n319\n00:17:42.090 --> 00:17:47.460\nAnd what I noticed when I as preparing for\nthis episode was that this was turned on.\n\n320\n00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:50.750\nSo this is something that you'll want we\nneed to understand for the exam what this\n\n321\n00:17:50.750 --> 00:17:54.810\noption does and two it might be something\nthat you want to check on your machine\n\n322\n00:17:54.810 --> 00:18:00.030\nbecause this option down here says allow\nanother device to turn on mobile hotspot.\n\n323\n00:18:00.030 --> 00:18:03.090\nBoth devices must have bluetooth\nturned on and be paired.\n\n324\n00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:08.980\nNot a huge security risk, but it is\nsomething that you should think about,\n\n325\n00:18:08.980 --> 00:18:13.779\nbecause if I leave this turned on, that\nmeans some other device would have already\n\n326\n00:18:13.779 --> 00:18:17.340\nhad to been paired, but we know that new\nattacks are coming out all the time.\n\n327\n00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:21.860\nMaybe somebody's figured out a way to\npair with my laptop without asking, and\n\n328\n00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:25.130\nthen turn on my hotspot,\nin the end what do they get?\n\n329\n00:18:25.130 --> 00:18:29.650\nMost likely just internet connection,\nbut it's the potential for\n\n330\n00:18:29.650 --> 00:18:30.400\nwhat else could occur.\n\n331\n00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:35.160\nSo just keep that option in mind\nif you might want to turn that off\n\n332\n00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:38.790\nto allow to turn on\nmobile hotspots remotely.\n\n333\n00:18:38.790 --> 00:18:41.680\n&gt;&gt; I could see where they wanted\nto add that as like a feature of\n\n334\n00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:44.810\nfunctionality because maybe\nthey do have a tablet and\n\n335\n00:18:44.810 --> 00:18:49.100\nI'm only using wifi for\nan hour or so a week.\n\n336\n00:18:49.100 --> 00:18:53.030\nSo I don't want to have this on all\nthe time, this hot spot setting, so.\n\n337\n00:18:53.030 --> 00:18:54.840\n&gt;&gt; Yeah I was thinking my home,\n\n338\n00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:58.510\nmy computer that sits in\nthe office that never moves,\n\n339\n00:18:58.510 --> 00:19:02.610\nif that was my only internet connection,\nit has a nice fast wire connection.\n\n340\n00:19:02.610 --> 00:19:07.020\nMaybe I want to sit on the couch\nwith my surface or tablet and\n\n341\n00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:08.700\nI don't want to get up and\ngo turn it on every time.\n\n342\n00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:09.940\nSo I can remotely turn it on.\n\n343\n00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:10.460\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n344\n00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:11.141\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nYeah, we've\n\n345\n00:19:11.141 --> 00:19:12.500\nalready talked about how the lazy.\n\n346\n00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:14.470\n&gt;&gt; The convenient sacrificing.\n\n347\n00:19:14.470 --> 00:19:15.760\nYeah, for that security.\n\n348\n00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:17.790\nIt's kind of that give and\ntake you were talking about Mike.\n\n349\n00:19:17.790 --> 00:19:19.140\n&gt;&gt; It is.\nYou move from,\n\n350\n00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:23.430\naway from security as you go towards\nconvenience and ease of use.\n\n351\n00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:25.070\nAlright, I'm going to turn that back off.\n\n352\n00:19:25.070 --> 00:19:27.130\nI also noticed, what I showed you there.\n\n353\n00:19:27.130 --> 00:19:28.320\nWhat I just discovered.\n\n354\n00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:31.040\nOnce you turn the hotspot on\nthat option does go away,\n\n355\n00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:32.840\nwhich kinda makes sense because it's on.\n\n356\n00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:36.830\nSo there's no need to remotely turn it on,\nI suppose, all right?\n\n357\n00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:38.780\nAnd I think that is it.\n\n358\n00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:43.670\nThis, people might say, well, why is\nit showing your password right there?\n\n359\n00:19:43.670 --> 00:19:47.170\nRemember, one,\nI'm not using my systems password, right,\n\n360\n00:19:47.170 --> 00:19:48.800\nor any of my important passwords.\n\n361\n00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:51.780\nThis is a password I created just for\nthis mobile hotspot.\n\n362\n00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:58.660\nAnd two if somebody has made it this far,\nand they can see this screen on my laptop,\n\n363\n00:19:59.890 --> 00:20:01.610\nmy least concern is probably the fact-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n364\n00:20:01.610 --> 00:20:04.220\n&gt;&gt; That they have my hotspot password.\n\n365\n00:20:04.220 --> 00:20:06.000\nBecause they're already\non my system right.\n\n366\n00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.930\nSo I'm making a little bit light of that,\nbut I know it seems\n\n367\n00:20:09.930 --> 00:20:13.830\nvery insecure to display that password\nlike that but it's really not.\n\n368\n00:20:13.830 --> 00:20:18.490\nIf they've made it this far and they can\nsee that, then we've got bigger problems.\n\n369\n00:20:18.490 --> 00:20:21.340\nIf they're over my shoulder and\nthey see that,\n\n370\n00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:25.740\nyes they can now connect to my mobile\nhot spot and get internet access.\n\n371\n00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:29.210\nSo that might be an issue, but\n\n372\n00:20:29.210 --> 00:20:32.130\nit's not the end all as far\nas security is concerned.\n\n373\n00:20:32.130 --> 00:20:35.020\nAnd another reason not to use\nanother one of your passwords\n\n374\n00:20:35.020 --> 00:20:37.910\nthat you use anywhere else\nbecause it is being displayed.\n\n375\n00:20:37.910 --> 00:20:39.560\nAnd if somebody was walking by and\n\n376\n00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:44.780\nsaw this they might think I wonder if I\ncan log on as Mike using that password.\n\n377\n00:20:44.780 --> 00:20:48.500\nOr I wonder if I gain access to his\nemail using that password right?\n\n378\n00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:52.000\nSo make sure you're not using the same\npassword you use for anything else.\n\n379\n00:20:53.090 --> 00:20:55.380\nAll right Cherokee we do\nhave more to cover but\n\n380\n00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:58.590\nwe're gonna start getting\ninto things like VPN's.\n\n381\n00:20:58.590 --> 00:21:00.600\nWhich is going to take a little\nmore time than what we got left, so\n\n382\n00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:02.560\nI think we probably want to stop there.\n\n383\n00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:03.480\n&gt;&gt; Okay, sounds like a plan.\n\n384\n00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:06.240\nWe'll come back and take a look at those\ndifferent types of remote connections\n\n385\n00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:07.770\nwe have available to us.\n\n386\n00:21:07.770 --> 00:21:11.090\nHopefully you'll be able to join us then,\nbut for now, let's sign out.\n\n387\n00:21:11.090 --> 00:21:12.510\nI've been your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n388\n00:21:12.510 --> 00:21:13.425\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n389\n00:21:13.425 --> 00:21:16.502\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITPro TV\n\n390\n00:21:16.502 --> 00:21:22.489\n[MUSIC]\n\n391\n00:21:22.489 --> 00:21:25.798\n&gt;&gt;

00:00:12.790\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro TV.\n&gt;&gt; Welcome, everyone,\n\n4\n00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:17.638\nto your Configuring Windows Devices\nseries, studying for that 70-697 exam.\n\n5\n00:00:17.638 --> 00:00:19.710\nI'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.380\nIn this episode, we'll continue taking\na look at how to configure our remote\n\n7\n00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.590\nconnections, and of course, with us today\nin studio we have Mr. Mike Rodrick.\n\n8\n00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:29.708\nHow is it going today, Mike?\n&gt;&gt; Great Cherokee, thanks for\n\n9\n00:00:29.708 --> 00:00:30.990\nhaving me back, excited as always.\n\n10\n00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.440\nAnd yeah,\nwe got a little bit more to talk about\n\n11\n00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.630\nwhen it comes to remote connections and\nworking with good old remote desktop.\n\n12\n00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:41.100\nWe've spent several episodes actually\ntalking about remote desktop,\n\n13\n00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.500\ngetting it enabled, taking a look\nat what you could do with it,\n\n14\n00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.230\na lot of the configuration options.\n&gt;&gt; A lot of good info.\n\n15\n00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:48.070\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, thank you,\n\n16\n00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:49.400\nI'm glad you enjoyed it.\n\n17\n00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.633\nBut there's a little\nbit more I wanna cover.\n\n18\n00:00:51.633 --> 00:00:55.630\nOne, is something known\nas restricted admin mode.\n\n19\n00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:00.550\nAnd something new\nWindows Defender Remote Credential Guard.\n\n20\n00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:04.210\nI have to remember because they've\nchanged the name of that just recently.\n\n21\n00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:07.738\nThey've added Windows defender in front\nof a lot of things, as you guys are,\n\n22\n00:01:07.738 --> 00:01:10.494\nI'm sure finding out as you're\nstudying up for this exam.\n\n23\n00:01:10.494 --> 00:01:13.880\n[COUGH] But it is, excuse me,\nWindows Defender Remote Credential Guard.\n\n24\n00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.250\nBoth of these are methods that\nare gonna be used to try to control or\n\n25\n00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:23.740\nhelp protect our credentials as we\nare making this remote connections, right?\n\n26\n00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.160\nWe know that as an IT person,\n\n27\n00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.860\nwe'll be using remote desktop a lot\nto do some remote administration.\n\n28\n00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.573\nOur servers are located in a server closet\nsomewhere, maybe not even on-prem with us,\n\n29\n00:01:34.573 --> 00:01:36.180\nthey could be somewhere else.\n\n30\n00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.509\nSo we'll use remote desktop\nto establish that connection,\n\n31\n00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.127\nmanage those remote servers,\nthose systems.\n\n32\n00:01:42.127 --> 00:01:45.583\nHelp desk for example uses\nthe remote desktop a lot to work\n\n33\n00:01:45.583 --> 00:01:50.100\non client computers when people\nare calling down to the help desk.\n\n34\n00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.040\nSo we're using remote desktop, and\n\n35\n00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.920\nwe want to try to protect those\ncredentials in a couple of ways.\n\n36\n00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.630\nOne, as they're transmitted across\nthe network we want to make sure\n\n37\n00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.110\nthey're safe there, which they are.\n\n38\n00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.620\nI mean, using RDP,\nit does use an encrypted authentication.\n\n39\n00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:08.060\nKerberos can fall back to MTLN if need be.\n\n40\n00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.676\nSo protect that.\n\n41\n00:02:10.676 --> 00:02:12.860\nAnd then, also our session, right?\n\n42\n00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.864\nOn the other end of things, like what\nhappens if that is compromised and\n\n43\n00:02:16.864 --> 00:02:19.349\nwe are remoting into a compromised system?\n\n44\n00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:21.302\nHow can we protect against that?\n\n45\n00:02:21.302 --> 00:02:24.313\nCuz if we think about it,\nlet's say that, Cherokee,\n\n46\n00:02:24.313 --> 00:02:27.645\nyou are on the help desk.\n&gt;&gt; As a help desk member, you probably\n\n47\n00:02:27.645 --> 00:02:31.699\nhave access to many servers to get on to\nthem or to at least remote on to them.\n\n48\n00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:35.528\nBut on client machines, you're probably\nan admin on all those machines, right?\n\n49\n00:02:35.528 --> 00:02:38.789\nCuz you need to be able to fix things,\nremote in there and fix things.\n\n50\n00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:41.813\nAnd so, what can end up happening\nis somebody could attempt to,\n\n51\n00:02:41.813 --> 00:02:44.227\nlet's say you remotee into\na compromised system.\n\n52\n00:02:44.227 --> 00:02:46.021\nThat system was already compromised,\n\n53\n00:02:46.021 --> 00:02:49.446\nnow whoever the bad actor that had\ncompromised that system could attempt to\n\n54\n00:02:49.446 --> 00:02:52.270\nbounce to other system as you,\ncuz they've now captured your\n\n55\n00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:56.070\ncredentials as you've authenticated\nto make that remote desktop session.\n\n56\n00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:59.209\nSo that's the idea behind\nthis two technologies,\n\n57\n00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:02.130\nis really protecting\nthat part of the process.\n\n58\n00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:10.380\nThe first one we'll talk about, I guess,\nlet's go in order, the restricted admin.\n\n59\n00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:14.176\nActually came out around Windows 7,\nso it's been around a little while.\n\n60\n00:03:14.176 --> 00:03:16.589\nWindows 7, server 2000.\n\n61\n00:03:16.589 --> 00:03:21.863\nI wanna say that you can go back\nto server 2012 with this, but\n\n62\n00:03:21.863 --> 00:03:27.600\nthe idea behind restricted admin was,\nwhat's a good way to put it?\n\n63\n00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:28.651\nYou have to be an administrator.\n\n64\n00:03:28.651 --> 00:03:32.723\nOne of the things that you'll find with\nrestricted admin is you have to be\n\n65\n00:03:32.723 --> 00:03:37.063\nin the local admins group on the machine\nyou're remoting into, the target,\n\n66\n00:03:37.063 --> 00:03:40.708\nin order to establish a remote\ndesktop connection, all right?\n\n67\n00:03:40.708 --> 00:03:42.321\nHence, the name restricted admin.\n\n68\n00:03:42.321 --> 00:03:46.048\nIf you're not in the local admins group on\nthe machine you're trying to remote into,\n\n69\n00:03:46.048 --> 00:03:49.240\nthen you're not gonna be able\nto establish that connection.\n\n70\n00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:53.110\nSo it helps, again,\ncontrol who's able to make the connection.\n\n71\n00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:55.500\nReleased with Windows 10 version 1607.\n\n72\n00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:00.270\nSo it's been a little while, is the\nWindows Defender Remote Credential Guard.\n\n73\n00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:03.750\nNow again, back then it wasn't called\nWindows Defender Remote Credential Guard,\n\n74\n00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.600\nit was just Remote Credential Guard.\n\n75\n00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.830\nNow it's\nWindows Defender Remote Credential Guard.\n\n76\n00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:08.420\nSame thing.\n\n77\n00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:14.249\nAnd the idea here is that we're going\nto control, we're gonna restrict it to,\n\n78\n00:04:14.249 --> 00:04:19.479\nnot NTLM, almost said that wrong,\nonly gonna be able to use Kerberos.\n\n79\n00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:22.263\nYou do need to be,\nyou don't have to be in the admins group,\n\n80\n00:04:22.263 --> 00:04:25.090\nyou do need to be in the remote\ndesktop users group.\n\n81\n00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.150\nBut it's going to restrict\nyour credentials,\n\n82\n00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.610\nagain, from being bounced\nto other machines.\n\n83\n00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:32.400\nSo let's start by taking\na look at my screen here.\n\n84\n00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.350\nNormally, I don't travel\nout to technet too much, or\n\n85\n00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:38.670\nMicrosoft docs on show, but this one\nI thought would be a good one to do.\n\n86\n00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:42.474\nSo I'm just on Microsoft,\ndocs.microsoft.com, and I'm going to\n\n87\n00:04:42.474 --> 00:04:46.597\nzoom in just a wee bit so we can see this\ncuz they've got a really nice chart and\n\n88\n00:04:46.597 --> 00:04:50.480\na couple of diagrams that I wanted to\nuse to show us the difference here.\n\n89\n00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:53.310\nSo when we look at just\nnormal remote desktop, right?\n\n90\n00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:56.680\nWithout Windows Defender Remote\nCredential Guard or anything else.\n\n91\n00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:59.860\nWe don't get Single Sign-in,\nwe have to authenticate for\n\n92\n00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:01.130\neach resource we're connecting to.\n\n93\n00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:04.150\nIn other words, if I remote in this\nserver, and then I need to go to\n\n94\n00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:08.290\nanother server from there, I'm gonna\nhave to authenticate again, all right?\n\n95\n00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:09.540\nSo no Single Sign-on.\n\n96\n00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:10.887\nI can use Kerberos or\n\n97\n00:05:10.887 --> 00:05:15.582\nNTLM as my authentication protocol\naccess to services from servers.\n\n98\n00:05:15.582 --> 00:05:17.168\nSo I can go to other machines.\n\n99\n00:05:17.168 --> 00:05:19.310\nAgain, I will have to authenticate again.\n\n100\n00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:21.626\nNo protection against something\ncalled pass the hash.\n\n101\n00:05:21.626 --> 00:05:24.953\nThis is when they capture my\nauthentication information.\n\n102\n00:05:24.953 --> 00:05:29.245\nThey didn't crack my account, but they've\ncaptured my authentication request, and\n\n103\n00:05:29.245 --> 00:05:31.049\ncould try to replay that hash later.\n\n104\n00:05:31.049 --> 00:05:34.480\nPrevent the use of credentials\nafter disconnection.\n\n105\n00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:38.530\nOnce I've disconnected, they could\npotentially gain access to my credentials\n\n106\n00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:42.690\nand gain access to that machine again\nbecause of the time out value, right?\n\n107\n00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:48.750\nThat session is still active, and\nsomebody could compromise that.\n\n108\n00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:50.090\nSo credentials are sent to the server,\n\n109\n00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:52.860\ncredentials are not protected\nfrom attackers on remote host,\n\n110\n00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:57.330\nattacker can continue to use credentials\nafter disconnection, all right?\n\n111\n00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:00.680\nSo that's Google just\nplain remote desktop.\n\n112\n00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:04.490\nNow, when we add in\nRemote Credential Guard,\n\n113\n00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:07.070\nif I can say that, and\nrestricted admin mode.\n\n114\n00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:09.680\nLet's compare these two here.\n\n115\n00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:13.380\nSo Remote Credential Guard,\nuses Kerberos but not NTLM.\n\n116\n00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:14.970\nBut it will not fail back to NTLM,\n\n117\n00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:19.250\nit will fail altogether\nrather than use NTLM, right?\n\n118\n00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:22.560\nNice, strong authentication,\naccess the services from server.\n\n119\n00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:25.440\nWe do get protection from pass the hash,\nand\n\n120\n00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:29.710\nthey won't be able to use my credentials\nonce that session has disconnected.\n\n121\n00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:33.720\nWe see some really good benefits\nof using remote credential guard.\n\n122\n00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:37.260\nCredentials protected by\nWindows Defender Remote Credential Guard,\n\n123\n00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.850\nconnecting to other systems\nusing Single Sign-on.\n\n124\n00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:43.330\nSo again, I've already authenticated,\nso I can just connect to the resources.\n\n125\n00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:46.370\nHost must support\nWindows Defender Remote Credential Guard.\n\n126\n00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:48.921\nWe're talking Windows 10 and\nServer 2016, right?\n\n127\n00:06:48.921 --> 00:06:54.818\nAnd Windows 10 needs to be after 1607,\nso at least build 1607.\n\n128\n00:06:54.818 --> 00:06:58.420\nRestricted admin mode.\n\n129\n00:06:58.420 --> 00:06:59.795\nKerberos and NTLM, but\n\n130\n00:06:59.795 --> 00:07:04.500\nyou cannot get services from the server or\naccess service from the server.\n\n131\n00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:09.410\nSo once I connect to that server, I cannot\nbounce to other machines from there,\n\n132\n00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:13.290\nbut it does give me protection against\npass to hash, and prevent user credentials\n\n133\n00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:14.820\nafter disconnection.\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\n\n134\n00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:18.660\nMike, so looking at these two right here,\nI definitely see increased benefits.\n\n135\n00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:21.200\nBut can we run them at the same time,\nor do I have to pick and\n\n136\n00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:23.800\nchoose which one I'm going to go with?\n&gt;&gt; You can actually run them at\n\n137\n00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:24.530\nthe same time.\n\n138\n00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:27.570\nI'm gonna show you how to enable it,\nthe host or the machine,\n\n139\n00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:30.900\nthe target that you're going into,\nthis does have to be enabled.\n\n140\n00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:36.160\nTell it to require remote credential or\nrestricted admin mode.\n\n141\n00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:41.540\nWe do have to specify something on the\nclient, the machine we are remoting from,\n\n142\n00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:45.570\nto trigger this as well, or we can turn\nit to where it always requires, and\n\n143\n00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:48.510\nI'll show you what I mean as we go.\n\n144\n00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:50.463\nBut back to the restricted admin mode,\n\n145\n00:07:50.463 --> 00:07:53.967\nyou can connect to other systems\nusing the Host Identity, all right?\n\n146\n00:07:53.967 --> 00:07:55.024\nSo not me.\n\n147\n00:07:55.024 --> 00:07:59.039\nRemember, with remote credential guard,\nI connect to one server.\n\n148\n00:07:59.039 --> 00:08:02.409\nAnd then, from that server connect\nto another server It says me,\n\n149\n00:08:02.409 --> 00:08:05.926\nas my signed in user account anyway,\nwhatever account I'm using.\n\n150\n00:08:05.926 --> 00:08:07.459\nWith restricted admin mode,\n\n151\n00:08:07.459 --> 00:08:11.470\nyou could connect to other systems\nusing the host's identity, right?\n\n152\n00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:14.160\nSo the computer account basically\nis who you're remoted into.\n\n153\n00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:21.220\nHighest level of protection requires\nuser account administrator rights.\n\n154\n00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:25.490\nAll right, that was just one of\nthe challenges maybe, of this one.\n\n155\n00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:28.412\nSo that's probably good.\n\n156\n00:08:28.412 --> 00:08:32.270\nAnd then, I wanna scroll down and just\ntake a look at a couple of these again.\n\n157\n00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:35.310\nReally just trying to differentiate\nbetween the two, cuz it's a little\n\n158\n00:08:35.310 --> 00:08:41.920\nconfusing as far as which one is better,\nor which one provides more protection.\n\n159\n00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:43.070\nSo let's take a look at this here.\n\n160\n00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:46.940\nProtection benefits with remote desktop,\nnothing.\n\n161\n00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:49.260\nWith remote credential guard.\n\n162\n00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.370\nUser credentials remain on the client.\n\n163\n00:08:51.370 --> 00:08:55.800\nAn attacker can act on behalf of the user\nonly, when the session is ongoing.\n\n164\n00:08:55.800 --> 00:09:00.602\nSo my credentials are never leaving my\nsystem when I connect to that remote\n\n165\n00:09:00.602 --> 00:09:05.370\nserver, and if I go to connect to\nother services from that server.\n\n166\n00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:09.096\nAll authentication request are gonna\nbe passed back to my client machine,\n\n167\n00:09:09.096 --> 00:09:11.490\nwhere I will authenticate, all right?\n\n168\n00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:16.410\nAnd they could that can only act as me,\nwhile this session is on going, as soon as\n\n169\n00:09:16.410 --> 00:09:20.040\nI kill the session, those credentials\nare not gonna be valid anymore.\n\n170\n00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:21.970\nWhereas in restricted admin mode,\n\n171\n00:09:21.970 --> 00:09:25.970\nyou're logging on to the server\nas local administrator.\n\n172\n00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:30.280\nEven though I'm Mike, and I'm a domain\nadmin, when I make that connection,\n\n173\n00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:35.310\nI'm actually connecting to that remote\nmachine as local admin, think about that.\n\n174\n00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:38.530\nAs a local admin, what resources do I\nhave access to on the rest of the domain?\n\n175\n00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:41.350\nNone, right?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n176\n00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:42.440\n&gt;&gt; I'm a local admin I'm not\n\n177\n00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:44.890\na domain user,\nI don't have access to anywhere,\n\n178\n00:09:44.890 --> 00:09:49.710\noutside of that, so if somebody was to try\nto compromise my session, they wouldn't\n\n179\n00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:53.600\nget access to anything beyond that server,\nso we're restricting it.\n\n180\n00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:54.670\nIt's bad enough that server got\n\n181\n00:09:54.670 --> 00:09:55.900\ncompromised.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n182\n00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:56.760\n&gt;&gt; But, at least I'm\n\n183\n00:09:56.760 --> 00:10:00.280\nnot allowing it to go beyond that,\nbecause if they steal that credentials,\n\n184\n00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:03.660\nthey're local admin on that server,\nand they can't go any further.\n\n185\n00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:06.280\nIt's the idea anyway, all right?\n\n186\n00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:10.420\nAs far as version support goes,\nthat's what I was saying earlier,\n\n187\n00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:13.550\n2016 and Windows 101607, for\nremote credential guard.\n\n188\n00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:17.330\nFor the restricted admin, all the way\nback to Window 7 and it was 2008 or 2002,\n\n189\n00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:20.250\nthey do that to be patched.\n\n190\n00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:21.440\nNow you can go to Microsoft and\n\n191\n00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:24.372\nfind information about the updates\nrequired to support that.\n\n192\n00:10:24.372 --> 00:10:27.295\nYou should already have them,\nif you're running those versions and\n\n193\n00:10:27.295 --> 00:10:29.340\nyou're keeping them up to date.\n\n194\n00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:31.130\nAs far as protection goes,\n\n195\n00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:35.860\nboth of them protect against past\nthe hash, those credential guard.\n\n196\n00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:39.500\nCredentials are protected after\ndisconnection with remote admin, or\n\n197\n00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:42.150\nrestricted admin on the local admin.\n\n198\n00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:44.220\nAnd this is one of the last\none I wanna show you here,\n\n199\n00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:45.920\nactually I'll show you a couple more here.\n\n200\n00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:48.190\nCredential support from\nthe remote desktop client.\n\n201\n00:10:49.210 --> 00:10:51.870\nSo when I open up remote desktop, right?\n\n202\n00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:54.870\nWith standard remote desktop, you've\nseen this, we've done three episodes so\n\n203\n00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:55.890\nfar on this.\n\n204\n00:10:55.890 --> 00:10:59.530\nI could type in my username and\nmy password, I could also\n\n205\n00:10:59.530 --> 00:11:04.390\nuse my signed on credentials, or\nI could save my credentials, right, with\n\n206\n00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:12.618\nthe credential guard, sorry so many names.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n207\n00:11:12.618 --> 00:11:14.218\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] With the remote credential\n\n208\n00:11:14.218 --> 00:11:16.380\nguard, signed-on credentials only.\n\n209\n00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:17.330\nI don't even get a chance,\n\n210\n00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:21.240\nwhen I create this connection\nusing Remote Credential Guard,\n\n211\n00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:25.250\nit uses my currently logged on user\naccount, and I can't provide any others.\n\n212\n00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:27.290\nI can't like, let me use Cherokee's name,\n\n213\n00:11:27.290 --> 00:11:29.440\nor a different admin account.\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n214\n00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:32.290\nthat scenario that you gave at\nthe beginning when you said, hey,\n\n215\n00:11:32.290 --> 00:11:36.290\nif I am remoting into another computer and\nthat's system is already compromised.\n\n216\n00:11:36.290 --> 00:11:39.430\nIf they were using anything like key\nstroke log or whatever, and then you went\n\n217\n00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:45.020\nto pivot off of that remote machine\nto log in into a server or something,\n\n218\n00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:49.300\nit is highly possible that they were\nable obtain that username and password.\n\n219\n00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:53.666\nSo here, with that single sign on, you're\njust totally circumventing that potential\n\n220\n00:11:53.666 --> 00:11:54.937\noutcome.\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely,\n\n221\n00:11:54.937 --> 00:11:59.140\ndefinitely at least reducing that,\nright, yep, absolutely.\n\n222\n00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:03.455\nLet's see what else, so\nwith the restricted admin mode,\n\n223\n00:12:03.455 --> 00:12:05.845\nyou can use signed on credentials,\nsupply credentials, and\n\n224\n00:12:05.845 --> 00:12:09.010\nsaved credentials, just like we\ncould with the original RDP client.\n\n225\n00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:10.885\nAccess-wise, this is another key.\n\n226\n00:12:10.885 --> 00:12:12.145\nAgain, I point these out,\n\n227\n00:12:12.145 --> 00:12:15.155\ncuz usually kinda questions they\nmight ask you on a test, right.\n\n228\n00:12:15.155 --> 00:12:16.675\nIf you need to do this,\nand this, and this,\n\n229\n00:12:16.675 --> 00:12:21.255\nwhere you need to satisfy these\nrequirements, which product would you use?\n\n230\n00:12:21.255 --> 00:12:23.592\nThe answer's right here\non this little chart.\n\n231\n00:12:23.592 --> 00:12:27.411\nIf you're using device guard,\nI'm sorry not device guard,\n\n232\n00:12:27.411 --> 00:12:30.750\ncredential guard,\nusers allowed, access-wise.\n\n233\n00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:34.380\nThat is members of the remote\ndesktop users of remote host.\n\n234\n00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:37.950\nSo in order to create\na remote desktop session\n\n235\n00:12:37.950 --> 00:12:42.580\nwith a machine that has\nthe credential guard turned on,\n\n236\n00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:45.160\nI need to be a member of\nthe remote desktop users group.\n\n237\n00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:49.680\nSo anybody that's not normally allowed,\nwill still be allowed,\n\n238\n00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:52.540\nif we enable credential guard.\n\n239\n00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:56.470\nWith the restricted admin mode,\nhowever, administrators only.\n\n240\n00:12:56.470 --> 00:12:59.220\nOnly member of the administrator's\ngroup of the remote host.\n\n241\n00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:00.720\nJust because I'm an admin on my laptop,\n\n242\n00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:03.700\ndoes not mean I'm an admin on\nthe server I'm trying to remote into.\n\n243\n00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:08.190\nI need to be in the local admins\ngroup on the target machine.\n\n244\n00:13:09.650 --> 00:13:12.290\nNetwork identity, another important one.\n\n245\n00:13:12.290 --> 00:13:16.480\nRemote desktop session connects to\nother resources as the signed in user,\n\n246\n00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:18.120\nwhen I'm doing credential guard.\n\n247\n00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:22.950\nIf we're doing restricted admin,\nyou connect to other resources\n\n248\n00:13:22.950 --> 00:13:27.350\nas remote hosts identity, again,\nthe computer account, right?\n\n249\n00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:32.290\nSo if the server I was remoted into have\nbeen given access to a remote server,\n\n250\n00:13:32.290 --> 00:13:33.120\nI could go that way but\n\n251\n00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:38.033\nnot as me, as the computer account for\nthe host I am remoted into.\n\n252\n00:13:38.033 --> 00:13:44.070\nMulti hops with the Credential Guard,\nI can remote into one machine.\n\n253\n00:13:44.070 --> 00:13:48.080\nAnd then from that desktop,\nremote into another machine, right, again,\n\n254\n00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:50.230\nusing my currently signed on credentials.\n\n255\n00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:53.342\nWhereas with Restricted Admin,\nnot allowed for users.\n\n256\n00:13:53.342 --> 00:13:54.700\nThe session's running as a local host,\n\n257\n00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:58.700\nso I can't bounce to another machine,\nbecause it's a local admin.\n\n258\n00:13:58.700 --> 00:14:00.520\nThey don't have any rights\non that other machine.\n\n259\n00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:07.380\nAnd again, this is a good test question\nwith Credential Guard Kerberos only,\n\n260\n00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:09.630\nfor the authentication protocol.\n\n261\n00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:14.440\nLast thing I wanna point out on this Tech\nDept page or this Docs on microsoft.com,\n\n262\n00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:18.060\ntalking about the helpdesk, again, this\ncould be a good test question for you.\n\n263\n00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:23.970\nThey'll recommend that you don't\nuse Credential Guard for helpdesk,\n\n264\n00:14:23.970 --> 00:14:29.450\nbecause once you initiate it, if they,\nif the server that I'm remoting\n\n265\n00:14:29.450 --> 00:14:34.380\ninto was compromised, and I remote into\nthat server, I'm giving it my credentials.\n\n266\n00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:38.390\nThey could then try to use those,\nthat active session,\n\n267\n00:14:38.390 --> 00:14:42.100\nI didn't send my credentials, let me\nrephrase that, it's still protected, but\n\n268\n00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:44.090\nthat active session I now have?\n\n269\n00:14:44.090 --> 00:14:48.680\nHas access to hop to other machines, so if\nthe machine I remote into is compromised,\n\n270\n00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:51.220\nthey could attempt to hop\nto other machines as me.\n\n271\n00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:55.320\nSo that is the fear as a help desk person,\n\n272\n00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:59.780\na lot of times you are remoting into\nmachines that could be compromised, so\n\n273\n00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:03.410\nwe want to limit that, and typically\nas a help desk, I wouldn't be bouncing,\n\n274\n00:15:03.410 --> 00:15:06.760\nI wouldn't remote into one system,\nand from there another system, right?\n\n275\n00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:09.240\nI help user A, I disconnect.\n\n276\n00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:11.980\nI go and I help user B, and I disconnect.\n\n277\n00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:12.850\nSo the whole,\n\n278\n00:15:12.850 --> 00:15:16.330\nyou can't go from one machine to another,\ndoesn't really affect me as a help desk.\n\n279\n00:15:16.330 --> 00:15:19.830\nSo they would recommend using\nthe restricted admin mode for\n\n280\n00:15:19.830 --> 00:15:21.554\nmy help desk people.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, got it.\n\n281\n00:15:21.554 --> 00:15:22.697\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n282\n00:15:22.697 --> 00:15:26.130\nrather than the credential guard.\n\n283\n00:15:26.130 --> 00:15:28.120\nEnough of that boring stuff, let's see it.\n\n284\n00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:29.216\nI shouldn't say that.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n285\n00:15:29.216 --> 00:15:30.384\n&gt;&gt; That's not boring, all right, but\n\n286\n00:15:30.384 --> 00:15:31.880\nit's not, it's not doing it.\n&gt;&gt; Hands on.\n\n287\n00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:32.748\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n288\n00:15:32.748 --> 00:15:34.080\nThat's what we like.\n\n289\n00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:37.790\nAll right, so\nto enable restricted admin mode.\n\n290\n00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:40.390\nFirst off, let's just prove ourselves.\n\n291\n00:15:40.390 --> 00:15:41.540\nRemote desktop is enabled.\n\n292\n00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:42.700\nWe can see that right here.\n\n293\n00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:43.990\nI could zoom in.\n\n294\n00:15:43.990 --> 00:15:45.859\nShow your remote desktop is enabled.\n\n295\n00:15:45.859 --> 00:15:50.632\nThis is one server one, if I take a look\nat my properties again, I can see it's\n\n296\n00:15:50.632 --> 00:15:55.774\nturned on, if I go select users, nobody's\nbeen added here, I already have access\n\n297\n00:15:55.774 --> 00:16:01.520\nbecause I am in the local admin's group,\nbecause I'm part of the domain admin.\n\n298\n00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:04.092\nAnd I go to over client one\nwhere I'm currently logged on.\n\n299\n00:16:04.092 --> 00:16:09.250\nIt'll launch a little command prompt here,\nall right.\n\n300\n00:16:09.250 --> 00:16:14.091\nYeah, and you can see I am logged\non lab/mike or the main admin.\n\n301\n00:16:14.091 --> 00:16:18.635\nAnd if I try to just do a remote\ndesktop connect, all right?\n\n302\n00:16:18.635 --> 00:16:20.475\nAnd I typed in M-S-T-S-C.\n\n303\n00:16:20.475 --> 00:16:23.066\nWe talked about that,\nMicrosoft Terminal Services Client.\n\n304\n00:16:23.066 --> 00:16:24.819\nAnd I type in Server one.\n\n305\n00:16:24.819 --> 00:16:28.689\nI go to connect, supply,\nI'm using password.\n\n306\n00:16:28.689 --> 00:16:30.993\nRemember, I could log on to\nsomebody else though, right?\n\n307\n00:16:30.993 --> 00:16:33.029\nI could use a different\naccount if I wanted to.\n\n308\n00:16:33.029 --> 00:16:37.139\nIt's just standard remote desktop,\nand I'll connect and\n\n309\n00:16:37.139 --> 00:16:41.589\neverything is golden,\nI'm in like Flynt, as they like to say.\n\n310\n00:16:41.589 --> 00:16:44.105\nThat was In like Flynn.\n&gt;&gt; Is it In like Flynn?\n\n311\n00:16:44.105 --> 00:16:45.445\n&gt;&gt; I don't know, I don't ever say that.\n\n312\n00:16:45.445 --> 00:16:47.301\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah?\n\n313\n00:16:47.301 --> 00:16:50.879\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Someone'll have to let us know, though.\n\n314\n00:16:50.879 --> 00:16:52.771\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we'll leave that one for\n\n315\n00:16:52.771 --> 00:16:57.199\nfuture discussion, but I went ahead and\ndisconnected my remote session.\n\n316\n00:16:57.199 --> 00:17:02.464\nYou saw that I was able to get in there,\nno problem, all right?\n\n317\n00:17:02.464 --> 00:17:07.158\nLet's do this now, I want to enable that\nrestricted admin to launch it, well,\n\n318\n00:17:07.158 --> 00:17:08.709\nlet's try it without it.\n\n319\n00:17:08.709 --> 00:17:16.420\nIf I do MSTSC switch restricted admin,\nall right?\n\n320\n00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:20.799\nSo I typed in Microsoft Terminal\nServices Client and then just added that\n\n321\n00:17:20.799 --> 00:17:25.273\nswitch restricted admin, those my\nremote desktop session launched up.\n\n322\n00:17:25.273 --> 00:17:28.794\nI'm gonna connect, and\nI'm going to authenticate.\n\n323\n00:17:32.213 --> 00:17:37.239\nAnd look at there, account restrictions\nare preventing the user from signing in.\n\n324\n00:17:37.239 --> 00:17:40.127\nBlank passwords aren't allowed,\nsign-in times are limited or\n\n325\n00:17:40.127 --> 00:17:41.972\na policy restriction has been enforced.\n\n326\n00:17:41.972 --> 00:17:44.936\nAll right, it's not really telling\nme what the exact problem is but\n\n327\n00:17:44.936 --> 00:17:45.932\nthat's a good thing.\n\n328\n00:17:45.932 --> 00:17:47.210\nThat's security, right?\n\n329\n00:17:47.210 --> 00:17:49.631\nThey don't want to tell us\nyou mistyped your password.\n\n330\n00:17:49.631 --> 00:17:53.235\nNow the bad guy knows exactly what they\ndid wrong and they can try to fix it.\n\n331\n00:17:53.235 --> 00:17:56.502\nBut the point is it wasn't, it's not\nallowing me to make that connection.\n\n332\n00:17:56.502 --> 00:17:58.035\nBecause the server,\n\n333\n00:17:58.035 --> 00:18:03.753\nthe target has to have restricted admin\nenabled before I'm allowed to do this.\n\n334\n00:18:03.753 --> 00:18:07.859\nSo let's flip back over to the server and\nsee what we've got.\n\n335\n00:18:07.859 --> 00:18:13.469\nThey did log out my session as I\nattempted to make that connection.\n\n336\n00:18:13.469 --> 00:18:16.356\nAnd, unfortunately to enable this,\n\n337\n00:18:18.607 --> 00:18:23.693\nWe're gonna need to edit our registry,\nyeah, that's right.\n\n338\n00:18:23.693 --> 00:18:27.904\nRegedit is everybody's favorite,\nso whatever tool you wanna use,\n\n339\n00:18:27.904 --> 00:18:29.944\nI guess I did that a little quick.\n\n340\n00:18:29.944 --> 00:18:35.225\nThis is not a sever admin class but\nR-E-G-E-D-I-T right,\n\n341\n00:18:35.225 --> 00:18:41.404\nRegedit, is what I just launched, and\nthat allows me to edit my registry.\n\n342\n00:18:41.404 --> 00:18:45.752\nIt remembers where I was the last time so\nlet me scroll back up and show you so\n\n343\n00:18:45.752 --> 00:18:47.661\nthat you know this for the exam.\n\n344\n00:18:47.661 --> 00:18:53.546\nHK Local Machine System,\nCurrent Control Set,\n\n345\n00:18:53.546 --> 00:18:58.289\nControl, and then the last one is LSA.\n\n346\n00:18:58.289 --> 00:19:01.705\nAnd inside LSA we're looking for\n\n347\n00:19:01.705 --> 00:19:06.838\na registry key called\ndisable restricted admin,\n\n348\n00:19:08.099 --> 00:19:12.686\nWhich we don't see because it\ndoesn't exist by default, all right?\n\n349\n00:19:12.686 --> 00:19:16.916\nSo let me zoom back out and\nmake a new key.\n\n350\n00:19:16.916 --> 00:19:21.150\nIt is gonna be a DWORD,\nthat's a 32-bit value for our registry.\n\n351\n00:19:21.150 --> 00:19:24.997\nAnd it needs to be called\ndisable restricted admin.\n\n352\n00:19:24.997 --> 00:19:26.535\nAnd you do have to spell it right.\n\n353\n00:19:26.535 --> 00:19:28.263\nSo let me type and\nnot talk at the same time.\n\n354\n00:19:28.263 --> 00:19:32.857\nDisable, Restricted, Admin.\n\n355\n00:19:32.857 --> 00:19:36.379\nAll right, so that is going to be\nthe key we're gonna create again.\n\n356\n00:19:36.379 --> 00:19:44.128\nDWORD variety, and then we're gonna set\nthe value to zero, and then click OK.\n\n357\n00:19:44.128 --> 00:19:45.082\nPretty easy, right?\n\n358\n00:19:45.082 --> 00:19:45.983\nAnd there is a command.\n\n359\n00:19:45.983 --> 00:19:49.363\nYou can do regadd, you're gonna\ndo this from the command line.\n\n360\n00:19:49.363 --> 00:19:52.157\nBut again, you're adding a D word,\nthe key is disabled,\n\n361\n00:19:52.157 --> 00:19:53.820\nrestricted admin, all one word.\n\n362\n00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:57.104\nDidn't have to cased properly but\nit does have to be spelled properly.\n\n363\n00:19:57.104 --> 00:19:59.843\nAnd then values actually is zero\nwhich is kinda interesting.\n\n364\n00:19:59.843 --> 00:20:00.489\n&gt;&gt; I know, and\n\n365\n00:20:00.489 --> 00:20:04.628\nI'm thinking cuz it's weird because\nto disable it, you're like, okay,\n\n366\n00:20:04.628 --> 00:20:08.830\nno, don't disable it, and if you set\nit to one then, you're essentially,\n\n367\n00:20:08.830 --> 00:20:11.708\nit's like you're not doing anything.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, well,\n\n368\n00:20:11.708 --> 00:20:14.246\nif you got to be careful with its wording,\nright?\n\n369\n00:20:14.246 --> 00:20:17.648\nDisable restricted admin,\nI want to turn restricted admin on,\n\n370\n00:20:17.648 --> 00:20:20.946\nI don't want to disable it.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so why doesn't it say enable and\n\n371\n00:20:20.946 --> 00:20:23.117\nthen put a one instead of disable and\nput a zero?\n\n372\n00:20:23.117 --> 00:20:25.008\n&gt;&gt; It's just the way Microsoft works,\n\n373\n00:20:25.008 --> 00:20:27.373\nright?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] The feature is not enabled.\n\n374\n00:20:27.373 --> 00:20:28.094\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n375\n00:20:28.094 --> 00:20:29.871\n&gt;&gt; And if I wanted to turn it on,\n\n376\n00:20:29.871 --> 00:20:32.249\nI'd set this and I had set it to a zero.\n\n377\n00:20:32.249 --> 00:20:37.273\nIf I wanted to say restricted admin I have\nto turn this on and set this to a one.\n\n378\n00:20:37.273 --> 00:20:39.835\nJust remember it for the test, okay?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n379\n00:20:39.835 --> 00:20:41.868\n&gt;&gt; The thing is I can't put logic to\n\n380\n00:20:41.868 --> 00:20:47.066\nMicrosoft but yeah, disable restricted\nadmin, we're gonna set that to false,\n\n381\n00:20:47.066 --> 00:20:50.853\nwhich means we are enabling\nrestricted admin, all right?\n\n382\n00:20:50.853 --> 00:20:54.640\nSo let me close the registry editor and\nwhen you edit the registry for\n\n383\n00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:58.368\nthat particular key,\nit shouldn't require any type of reboots.\n\n384\n00:20:58.368 --> 00:21:01.207\nI'm gonna close this and\nlaunch that again.\n\n385\n00:21:01.207 --> 00:21:06.249\nSo now, MSTSC restricted admin again.\n\n386\n00:21:06.249 --> 00:21:11.171\nSame thing, it wants me to authenticate,\nand again I could change credentials if I\n\n387\n00:21:11.171 --> 00:21:16.086\nwanted to,\nThen I'm getting a certificate error or\n\n388\n00:21:16.086 --> 00:21:19.683\na warning this time which is a little\nbit better sign, and there we go.\n\n389\n00:21:19.683 --> 00:21:23.276\nI am in, as they say, all right?\n\n390\n00:21:23.276 --> 00:21:26.567\nAnd there's my command\nprompt that's still open,\n\n391\n00:21:26.567 --> 00:21:29.950\nactually that's not the,\nit's the wrong machine.\n\n392\n00:21:29.950 --> 00:21:36.836\nThere we go, and\nif I was to say, who am I?\n\n393\n00:21:36.836 --> 00:21:40.429\nI am still Lab Mike, all right?\n\n394\n00:21:40.429 --> 00:21:46.454\nAll right, so I'm remoted into server one,\nusing that restricted admin mode,\n\n395\n00:21:46.454 --> 00:21:51.963\nwhich means I have to be in the local\nadmins group in order for this to work.\n\n396\n00:21:51.963 --> 00:21:53.779\nLet me sign out.\n\n397\n00:21:57.957 --> 00:22:01.441\nAnd let's authenticate as somebody else.\n\n398\n00:22:10.705 --> 00:22:14.067\nLet's see what else I wanna do with this.\n\n399\n00:22:14.067 --> 00:22:15.531\nSo we'll log on as Cherokee.\n\n400\n00:22:15.531 --> 00:22:18.853\nNow, Cherokee is not in\nthe local admin's group.\n\n401\n00:22:18.853 --> 00:22:22.763\nSo let's just see what happens, let's go\nahead and launch a command prompt, or\n\n402\n00:22:22.763 --> 00:22:24.328\nI'll just do it from down here.\n\n403\n00:22:24.328 --> 00:22:30.785\nMSTSC Switch restricted admin.\n\n404\n00:22:30.785 --> 00:22:35.409\nSo I'm just running it from that run line\ndown there rather than open up [CROSSTALK]\n\n405\n00:22:35.409 --> 00:22:36.435\ncommand prompt.\n\n406\n00:22:36.435 --> 00:22:39.407\nYeah, it is, isn't it?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n407\n00:22:39.407 --> 00:22:40.450\n&gt;&gt; Let's see where we're at.\n\n408\n00:22:40.450 --> 00:22:42.714\nSo we've turned it on on the server.\n\n409\n00:22:42.714 --> 00:22:46.013\nWell, we've turned off disabling it,\nright?\n\n410\n00:22:46.013 --> 00:22:46.605\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n411\n00:22:46.605 --> 00:22:48.224\n&gt;&gt; And he set it to a zero, and\n\n412\n00:22:48.224 --> 00:22:50.672\nit worked when Mike tried to remote in.\n\n413\n00:22:50.672 --> 00:22:52.723\nLet's see what happens\nwhen Cherokee tries.\n\n414\n00:22:52.723 --> 00:22:54.570\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm curious because will it allow\n\n415\n00:22:54.570 --> 00:22:57.784\nme to be a local admin for a temporary\nmoment in time, or is it just gonna be\n\n416\n00:22:57.784 --> 00:23:01.599\nlike nope, we have to follow the rules?\n&gt;&gt; Let's find out.\n\n417\n00:23:01.599 --> 00:23:02.867\nAnd there we go.\n\n418\n00:23:02.867 --> 00:23:03.374\nWhoops.\n\n419\n00:23:03.374 --> 00:23:05.952\nI don't have Zoomit running\non this [INAUDIBLE]\n\n420\n00:23:05.952 --> 00:23:06.981\n&gt;&gt; I see the big red x,\n\n421\n00:23:06.981 --> 00:23:07.572\nMike.\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n422\n00:23:07.572 --> 00:23:08.317\nyeah.\n&gt;&gt; You can fill me in\n\n423\n00:23:08.317 --> 00:23:08.971\non the rest, what does it say?\n\n424\n00:23:08.971 --> 00:23:11.443\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; The connection was denied because\n\n425\n00:23:11.443 --> 00:23:14.324\nthe user account is not authorized for\nremote log on.\n\n426\n00:23:14.324 --> 00:23:15.056\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n427\n00:23:15.056 --> 00:23:18.642\n&gt;&gt; All right, let's go over to the server,\n\n428\n00:23:18.642 --> 00:23:21.721\nand just see what's going on here.\n\n429\n00:23:21.721 --> 00:23:26.187\nI'm gonna log in as me because I also\nknow that you might not be able to log\n\n430\n00:23:26.187 --> 00:23:31.109\ninto the server simply because you're\nnot in the remote desktop users group.\n\n431\n00:23:31.109 --> 00:23:33.726\nSo, let's add Cherokee here.\n\n432\n00:23:38.066 --> 00:23:38.839\nAll right, so\n\n433\n00:23:38.839 --> 00:23:42.846\nnow I have added Cherokee to the remote\ndesktop users group on our target.\n\n434\n00:23:42.846 --> 00:23:44.552\nWe're gonna flip back over to the client,\nand\n\n435\n00:23:44.552 --> 00:23:47.283\nshe's gonna attempt to\nconnect one more time.\n\n436\n00:23:47.283 --> 00:23:52.553\nAsk for credentials,\nwe get a certificate warning,\n\n437\n00:23:52.553 --> 00:23:55.052\nand so close.\n&gt;&gt; A different error,\n\n438\n00:23:55.052 --> 00:23:55.759\nthough.\n&gt;&gt; So close!\n\n439\n00:23:55.759 --> 00:23:56.820\nYes, all right, so\n\n440\n00:23:56.820 --> 00:24:01.010\nthe first error was because Cherokee\njust wasn't able to remote into servers.\n\n441\n00:24:01.010 --> 00:24:05.991\nAll right, so I add a directory to remote\ndesktop users group, which at this point,\n\n442\n00:24:05.991 --> 00:24:09.168\nif she was using the standard,\nin fact you know what?\n\n443\n00:24:09.168 --> 00:24:12.262\nWhy listen to Mike say it,\nlet's just try it.\n\n444\n00:24:12.262 --> 00:24:17.115\nLet's see, remote desktop connection,\nwithout the forward slash\n\n445\n00:24:17.115 --> 00:24:21.967\nrestricted admin, as Cherokee.\n&gt;&gt; I should be\n\n446\n00:24:21.967 --> 00:24:26.013\nable to log on, it's my guess.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n447\n00:24:26.013 --> 00:24:28.530\nsure enough, she's in there, all right?\n\n448\n00:24:28.530 --> 00:24:32.088\nAnd now Cherokee is connected using\nthe standard remote desktop client.\n\n449\n00:24:32.088 --> 00:24:37.292\nI'm gonna sign out, And\n\n450\n00:24:37.292 --> 00:24:43.703\nas Cherokee again from the same\nmachine to the same machine,\n\n451\n00:24:43.703 --> 00:24:48.491\nthis time MSTSC switch, restricted admin.\n\n452\n00:24:55.323 --> 00:24:57.350\nAnd you get this, right?\n\n453\n00:24:57.350 --> 00:25:00.578\nSo she can remote into\nthe server at this point but\n\n454\n00:25:00.578 --> 00:25:06.406\nshe cannot do it in restricted admin mode,\nand that's because with restricted admin,\n\n455\n00:25:06.406 --> 00:25:10.447\nyou have to be a member of\nthe local admins group, all right?\n\n456\n00:25:10.447 --> 00:25:12.862\nSo I'm gonna cancel out that.\n\n457\n00:25:12.862 --> 00:25:18.957\nAnd let's go ahead Cherokee\nto the local admin's group.\n\n458\n00:25:18.957 --> 00:25:21.391\nLet's see what's the easiest\nway to add you in\n\n459\n00:25:21.391 --> 00:25:24.795\nhere?\n&gt;&gt; Adec?\n\n460\n00:25:24.795 --> 00:25:28.060\n&gt;&gt; Let's do, no this is the local,\n\n461\n00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:34.284\nLocal admin's group I need to add you to.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n462\n00:25:34.284 --> 00:25:37.248\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; My tool is a little slow, there we go.\n\n463\n00:25:37.248 --> 00:25:42.644\nAdministrator's group, add, Cherokee,\n\n464\n00:25:42.644 --> 00:25:48.431\nI add her domain account\nto the local admin's group.\n\n465\n00:25:48.431 --> 00:25:55.786\nNow I go back over the client,\nand we'll try it one more time,\n\n466\n00:25:55.786 --> 00:26:00.414\nMSTSC switch.\n&gt;&gt; I have a feeling this is it, Mike.\n\n467\n00:26:00.414 --> 00:26:04.489\n&gt;&gt; Restricted admin, will it connect?\n\n468\n00:26:04.489 --> 00:26:09.969\nUser password, accept the certificate and\n\n469\n00:26:09.969 --> 00:26:13.640\n[SOUND], we are successful.\n\n470\n00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:14.832\nSo we were able to connect.\n\n471\n00:26:14.832 --> 00:26:19.347\nSo, to sum that up real quick\nthen restrict the admin,\n\n472\n00:26:19.347 --> 00:26:23.859\nyou have to be,\none has to be enabled on the server, and\n\n473\n00:26:23.859 --> 00:26:30.070\nthen you have to be in the local admin's\ngroup for that to work, all right?\n\n474\n00:26:30.070 --> 00:26:33.353\nLet me sign out of that, and\nthe last one I wanna show you and\n\n475\n00:26:33.353 --> 00:26:37.105\nwe got a little show down time and\nwe get just a little bit more to do.\n\n476\n00:26:37.105 --> 00:26:39.820\nThe other one is the credential guard,\nright?\n\n477\n00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:41.901\nThere is the new one.\n\n478\n00:26:41.901 --> 00:26:45.640\nThe Windows defender\nRemote Credential Guard.\n\n479\n00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:50.768\nFor that one, you're gonna launch\nit with in fact [INAUDIBLE],\n\n480\n00:26:50.768 --> 00:26:54.464\nI'm gonna switch user accounts real quick.\n\n481\n00:26:54.464 --> 00:26:58.635\nBecause I knew that my user account\nhas a nice big font on PowerShell.\n\n482\n00:26:58.635 --> 00:27:00.222\nAll that good stuff.\n\n483\n00:27:01.650 --> 00:27:08.030\nSo let me just sign in real quick and\nbasically it's the same idea, right?\n\n484\n00:27:08.030 --> 00:27:13.708\nI would do MSTSC, switch, and then,\n\n485\n00:27:13.708 --> 00:27:18.861\ngosh it's,\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]\n\n486\n00:27:18.861 --> 00:27:23.610\n&gt;&gt; I gotta remember this, it's remote.\n\n487\n00:27:25.460 --> 00:27:26.323\nRegard.\n\n488\n00:27:26.323 --> 00:27:27.514\nIt took me a second there.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n489\n00:27:27.514 --> 00:27:28.090\n&gt;&gt; I tell you,\n\n490\n00:27:28.090 --> 00:27:31.340\nit's really easy to get these\nswitches all jumbled up.\n\n491\n00:27:31.340 --> 00:27:32.010\n&gt;&gt; I told you,\n\n492\n00:27:32.010 --> 00:27:36.298\nI have to always say that Microsoft\nTerminal Services client just to get that\n\n493\n00:27:36.298 --> 00:27:36.974\ntyped out.\n\n494\n00:27:36.974 --> 00:27:39.458\nSo I feel you, Mike.\n&gt;&gt; It's easy to do, isn't it?\n\n495\n00:27:39.458 --> 00:27:40.400\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n496\n00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:43.278\n&gt;&gt; So instead of typing in restricted\n\n497\n00:27:43.278 --> 00:27:46.362\nadmin I launch it with remote guard.\n\n498\n00:27:46.362 --> 00:27:51.870\nAnd then I go ahead and connect,\nand I shouldn't have any problems.\n\n499\n00:27:56.519 --> 00:27:59.970\nAuthentication error is [INAUDIBLE]\nthe function is not supported.\n\n500\n00:27:59.970 --> 00:28:03.126\nAll right so-\n&gt;&gt; It's not the deterrent enabled on this\n\n501\n00:28:03.126 --> 00:28:06.980\nor disable such as zero on this machine?\n&gt;&gt; It's the target that\n\n502\n00:28:06.980 --> 00:28:10.152\nwere concerned with right,\nwhich we know we already set that to zero.\n\n503\n00:28:10.152 --> 00:28:17.213\nThere is a setting on this computer\nthat I need to configure, all right?\n\n504\n00:28:17.213 --> 00:28:20.790\nAnd let me make sure I get\nthis correct for everybody.\n\n505\n00:28:20.790 --> 00:28:22.032\n&gt;&gt; All right Mike, so\n\n506\n00:28:22.032 --> 00:28:25.551\nwhat's going on here?\n&gt;&gt; Honestly I think this machine is just\n\n507\n00:28:25.551 --> 00:28:27.203\ntired, it should be working.\n\n508\n00:28:27.203 --> 00:28:31.860\nLet's jump over to another machine and\njust test that theory out.\n\n509\n00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:35.382\nI've made a lot of configuration changes\nback and forth and something is probably\n\n510\n00:28:35.382 --> 00:28:37.995\nhung up or cached somewhere,\nI have to give it a little time.\n\n511\n00:28:37.995 --> 00:28:42.816\nSo on a different Windows 10\nmachine I am going to open up,\n\n512\n00:28:42.816 --> 00:28:46.921\nit doesn't really matter,\nPowerShell, or work.\n\n513\n00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:52.083\nAnd, I know that's a little small,\nI'll zoom in for you here.\n\n514\n00:28:52.083 --> 00:28:57.074\nI'm just gonna do mstsc /remoteguard,\nright?\n\n515\n00:28:57.074 --> 00:29:00.511\nI'll zoom back out, so\nyou can see everything.\n\n516\n00:29:00.511 --> 00:29:03.195\nServer 01 is my destination,\nI'll click Connect.\n\n517\n00:29:04.340 --> 00:29:06.595\nAnd notice it just connected, right?\n\n518\n00:29:06.595 --> 00:29:12.440\nI did not get a prompt for\ncredentials, or any of that.\n\n519\n00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:15.136\nIn fact let's close that session and\nlet me show you one more time,\n\n520\n00:29:15.136 --> 00:29:16.107\npay attention to this.\n\n521\n00:29:16.107 --> 00:29:20.554\nMSTSC remote guard, and it says your logon\n\n522\n00:29:20.554 --> 00:29:26.120\ncredentials are going to be used,\nI go Show More.\n\n523\n00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:27.911\nNotice I don't have any way\nto check always ask for\n\n524\n00:29:27.911 --> 00:29:28.812\ncredentials.\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n525\n00:29:28.812 --> 00:29:31.310\nbecause this is where you would\nbe typing that in normally.\n\n526\n00:29:31.310 --> 00:29:32.203\n&gt;&gt; Right, exactly, and\n\n527\n00:29:32.203 --> 00:29:33.289\nI would have options here.\n\n528\n00:29:33.289 --> 00:29:37.683\nBut with Remote Guard,\nit's using your signed on credentials, and\n\n529\n00:29:37.683 --> 00:29:41.910\nyou cannot do provided credentials or\nsaved credentials.\n\n530\n00:29:41.910 --> 00:29:46.180\nI click Connect, and\nit just connects and there you go.\n\n531\n00:29:46.180 --> 00:29:49.160\nSo that is the Remote Credential Guard?\n\n532\n00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:51.142\nI showed you some of the different\nthings that they us.\n\n533\n00:29:51.142 --> 00:29:55.123\nBoth of these, Remote Credential Guard\nas well as restricted admin,\n\n534\n00:29:55.123 --> 00:29:57.490\nprotect against a lot of the same things.\n\n535\n00:29:57.490 --> 00:30:03.062\nThey're protecting my credentials from\nthat session on that remote server.\n\n536\n00:30:03.062 --> 00:30:06.762\nThey're making sure that my credentials\naren't sent across the network in\n\n537\n00:30:06.762 --> 00:30:07.820\nplain text.\n\n538\n00:30:07.820 --> 00:30:11.852\nThey go about it a little differently and\nthey have a different restrictions, right?\n\n539\n00:30:11.852 --> 00:30:13.620\nWith Remote Credential Guard,\n\n540\n00:30:13.620 --> 00:30:17.330\nI'm able to connect only with\nmy assigned in user account.\n\n541\n00:30:17.330 --> 00:30:20.615\nOther than that I need to be in\nthe remote desktop users group as normal.\n\n542\n00:30:20.615 --> 00:30:24.360\nI do not need to be an admin\non the machine, right?\n\n543\n00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:26.012\nUsing Remote Credential Guard.\n\n544\n00:30:26.012 --> 00:30:32.110\nBut I can connect other resource from\nthe server using Remote Credential Guard.\n\n545\n00:30:32.110 --> 00:30:36.222\nWhere restricted admin I have to be\nin the remote desktop users group and\n\n546\n00:30:36.222 --> 00:30:37.667\nthe local admins group.\n\n547\n00:30:37.667 --> 00:30:41.999\nSame protection for my credentials from\nPass-the-Hash, but when I connect to that\n\n548\n00:30:41.999 --> 00:30:45.810\nremote server, I can’t connect to\nany other services from there.\n\n549\n00:30:45.810 --> 00:30:50.639\nI am basically the local administrator\non that machine at that point.\n\n550\n00:30:50.639 --> 00:30:54.147\nBoth of them are enabled the same way,\nand you can kill my screen feed,\n\n551\n00:30:54.147 --> 00:30:56.895\nwe're not gonna look at\nanything else there, right?\n\n552\n00:30:56.895 --> 00:31:01.273\nThat same registry key,\ndisable restricted admin, set it to zero.\n\n553\n00:31:01.273 --> 00:31:04.705\nI did that to enable\nrestricted admin mode.\n\n554\n00:31:04.705 --> 00:31:07.969\nYou would have to the same thing with\nRemote Credential Guard, all right?\n\n555\n00:31:07.969 --> 00:31:11.012\nThere's no,\nit's not a different registry key,\n\n556\n00:31:11.012 --> 00:31:15.920\nit's the same registry key to save all\nrestricted admin, set that to zero.\n\n557\n00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:18.552\nThat will enable both\nrestricted admin mode,\n\n558\n00:31:18.552 --> 00:31:21.454\nas well as Remote Credential Guard\non that server,\n\n559\n00:31:21.454 --> 00:31:25.510\nthat needs to be on each machine\nyou're remoting into though, right?\n\n560\n00:31:25.510 --> 00:31:30.246\nSo this might be somewhere I might wanna\nuse a policy to push out that registry\n\n561\n00:31:30.246 --> 00:31:32.253\nchange to all of those servers.\n\n562\n00:31:32.253 --> 00:31:39.770\nOther things that we've gotta think about\nis the user has to specify every time.\n\n563\n00:31:39.770 --> 00:31:44.621\nLike you've noticed I had to do\nMSTSC switch restricted admin, or\n\n564\n00:31:44.621 --> 00:31:46.362\nmstsc/remoteguard.\n\n565\n00:31:46.362 --> 00:31:51.570\nNow, what's gonna happen\nif a user doesn't do that?\n\n566\n00:31:51.570 --> 00:31:56.303\nLike let's say my help desk person I've\ntold them to use restricted admin mode but\n\n567\n00:31:56.303 --> 00:31:57.825\nthey forget to type it in.\n\n568\n00:31:57.825 --> 00:32:00.200\nOr they just to go their Start menu and\nclick remote desktop.\n\n569\n00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:03.360\nGuess what it's not gonna be enabled,\nright?\n\n570\n00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:07.700\nSo there is a policy I will show you\none more thing, I lied to you, Taylor.\n\n571\n00:32:07.700 --> 00:32:11.610\nLet's look at my screen one more time,\nI'm gonna flip back over to client one.\n\n572\n00:32:11.610 --> 00:32:14.580\nAnd I'm gonna close up some of this and\n\n573\n00:32:14.580 --> 00:32:19.899\nI wanna do a little reg edit action,\nall right.\n\n574\n00:32:19.899 --> 00:32:26.140\nAnd yes and in here, so now I'm in the\nclient machine, my everyday workstation.\n\n575\n00:32:26.140 --> 00:32:29.310\nOr the ones that my help desk users or\n\n576\n00:32:29.310 --> 00:32:32.160\nmy help desk employees\nare sitting at everyday.\n\n577\n00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:34.550\nWe're gonna go into computer config,\nsorry, you know what?\n\n578\n00:32:34.550 --> 00:32:37.600\nI did reg edit, it's not a registry edit,\n\n579\n00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:41.246\nthis is a group policy.\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] GP edit yeah.\n\n580\n00:32:41.246 --> 00:32:43.630\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Reg edit's brother.\n\n581\n00:32:43.630 --> 00:32:45.855\n&gt;&gt; Exactly [LAUGH] all right, so.\n\n582\n00:32:45.855 --> 00:32:47.955\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I don't even know why I think\n\n583\n00:32:47.955 --> 00:32:51.670\nthese things.\n&gt;&gt; In the local computer policy\n\n584\n00:32:51.670 --> 00:32:56.140\nunder computer configuration\nadministrative templates system.\n\n585\n00:32:57.700 --> 00:33:02.780\nAnd then credential delegation and\nthere's one in here,\n\n586\n00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:07.660\nrestrict delegation of\ncredentials to remote servers.\n\n587\n00:33:07.660 --> 00:33:10.460\nThis is not configured,\nI'm gonna double click on it.\n\n588\n00:33:10.460 --> 00:33:14.463\nAnd I've got enabled or disabled and\nlet me zoom in so you can see this, right.\n\n589\n00:33:14.463 --> 00:33:19.158\nIf I choose enabled I've got this drop\ndown list that I can choose from,\n\n590\n00:33:19.158 --> 00:33:23.860\nrequire remote credential guard,\nrequire restricted admin.\n\n591\n00:33:23.860 --> 00:33:28.490\nOr restrict credential delegation and\nthey will give you a really good\n\n592\n00:33:28.490 --> 00:33:32.360\nexplanation over here with\nstrict credential delegation.\n\n593\n00:33:34.100 --> 00:33:36.890\nWe're not gonna talk about that one,\nthe two I wanna focus require remote\n\n594\n00:33:36.890 --> 00:33:38.980\ncredential guard,\nrequire restricted admin.\n\n595\n00:33:38.980 --> 00:33:41.970\nThose are the two that we would\nenable if we were using those right?\n\n596\n00:33:41.970 --> 00:33:44.386\nIf we wanted to make sure that for\n\n597\n00:33:44.386 --> 00:33:48.685\nexample my help desk always\nused restricted admin mode.\n\n598\n00:33:48.685 --> 00:33:49.990\nKeep in mind however,\n\n599\n00:33:49.990 --> 00:33:55.150\nif you enable this policy most likely you\nwouldn't be doing it on the local system.\n\n600\n00:33:55.150 --> 00:33:59.300\nYou'd be using a domain based policy to\napply it to all machines in the help desk\n\n601\n00:33:59.300 --> 00:34:00.850\narea or what have you.\n\n602\n00:34:00.850 --> 00:34:03.915\nBut when you do use that\npolicy it is required,\n\n603\n00:34:03.915 --> 00:34:07.810\nyhat means it will every\nsystem they remote into.\n\n604\n00:34:07.810 --> 00:34:11.350\nIs now gonna have that tacked onto the end\nif you think about it that way, right?\n\n605\n00:34:11.350 --> 00:34:16.470\nThey're always gonna be using restricted\nadmin mode or remote guard mode.\n\n606\n00:34:16.470 --> 00:34:19.500\nIf they, because they're\nalways gonna be using that,\n\n607\n00:34:19.500 --> 00:34:23.100\nevery system that they remote into,\nneeds to have that registry key,\n\n608\n00:34:23.100 --> 00:34:27.620\ndisable restricted access set to zero,\nright?\n\n609\n00:34:27.620 --> 00:34:30.390\nI'm sorry, disable restricted admin,\nI think I said access.\n\n610\n00:34:30.390 --> 00:34:31.710\nSo something to keep in mind.\n\n611\n00:34:31.710 --> 00:34:35.830\nYes, you can turn it on so\nthat your end users, or your help desk or\n\n612\n00:34:35.830 --> 00:34:39.310\nwhomever are always using that mode,\nwhen they do remote desktop.\n\n613\n00:34:39.310 --> 00:34:43.291\nBut that means they won't be remote into\nanything that doesn't have that turned on.\n\n614\n00:34:43.291 --> 00:34:45.941\nSo all of your servers are gonna\nneed that registry entry or\n\n615\n00:34:45.941 --> 00:34:50.630\nall the client machines that they remote\ninto are gonna need that registry entry.\n\n616\n00:34:50.630 --> 00:34:53.620\nAll right the last thing I wanna mention\nthat they call it on the objectives\n\n617\n00:34:53.620 --> 00:34:57.980\nconfiguring mode desktop clients for\nWindows 10 mobile, iOS and Android.\n\n618\n00:34:57.980 --> 00:35:00.310\nHonestly there's not a lot to say here.\n\n619\n00:35:00.310 --> 00:35:05.180\nThere's apps available for\niOS and for Android.\n\n620\n00:35:05.180 --> 00:35:08.880\nAnd who would've thunk it, Windows\n10 mobile has a remote desktop app.\n\n621\n00:35:10.190 --> 00:35:12.480\nYou just go, you download those apps.\n\n622\n00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:14.350\nAnd just like any other\nremote desktop connection,\n\n623\n00:35:14.350 --> 00:35:20.190\nyou'll need to supply an IP address or\na target and then credentials to connect.\n\n624\n00:35:20.190 --> 00:35:21.840\nI don't know about the Android one,\n\n625\n00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:24.799\nI know the IOS one supports admin mode.\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\n\n626\n00:35:24.799 --> 00:35:27.749\nthat's what I was wondering too.\n&gt;&gt; There is a switch in there that I can\n\n627\n00:35:27.749 --> 00:35:32.663\nturn that on, because if I wanna enable\nthat or use that when I'm connecting from\n\n628\n00:35:32.663 --> 00:35:36.010\nthese tablets, or surface,\nor something like that.\n\n629\n00:35:36.010 --> 00:35:39.200\nBut that'll be dependent on the app you\nget, right, I don't know the Android\n\n630\n00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:42.263\nversion, I know the iOS version so.\n&gt;&gt; Well plus they release it's update all\n\n631\n00:35:42.263 --> 00:35:45.473\nthe time too, so it means that update\nin the OS, is an updates to the apps.\n\n632\n00:35:45.473 --> 00:35:48.650\nThen you might wanna just\ncheck on that [LAUGH]\n\n633\n00:35:48.650 --> 00:35:49.367\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, definitely.\n\n634\n00:35:49.367 --> 00:35:50.341\n&gt;&gt; Before you go ahead and\n\n635\n00:35:50.341 --> 00:35:53.569\nroll that out in your enterprise or\nsomething, if that's how you want to be\n\n636\n00:35:53.569 --> 00:35:55.300\nmanaging those system.\n&gt;&gt; That's it.\n\n637\n00:35:55.300 --> 00:35:56.030\n&gt;&gt; All right Mike,\n\n638\n00:35:56.030 --> 00:35:57.240\ndo you have any final thoughts here?\n\n639\n00:35:57.240 --> 00:35:59.010\nWe've been talking about\nour remote connections for\n\n640\n00:35:59.010 --> 00:36:01.710\na while.\n&gt;&gt; Again, I'll make sure I'll put that\n\n641\n00:36:01.710 --> 00:36:06.725\nlink in the show notes for our article,\nMicrosoft, I talked about the differences.\n\n642\n00:36:06.725 --> 00:36:09.620\nBecause I know me sitting\nhere talking about it and\n\n643\n00:36:09.620 --> 00:36:12.590\ngoing through it like this, it's hard\nto differentiate between the two.\n\n644\n00:36:12.590 --> 00:36:14.480\nIt's all about what switch you use.\n\n645\n00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:17.650\nAnd for the exam it's important to\nunderstand what the limitations of each\n\n646\n00:36:17.650 --> 00:36:18.590\nones are.\n\n647\n00:36:18.590 --> 00:36:19.790\nJust to say it one more time,\n\n648\n00:36:19.790 --> 00:36:24.120\nrestricted admin, you have to be\na member of the local admins group.\n\n649\n00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:26.580\nAnd you cannot bounce to other machines.\n\n650\n00:36:26.580 --> 00:36:31.050\nIt's more secure as far as if somebody\nhad compromised that remote machine and\n\n651\n00:36:31.050 --> 00:36:33.160\nI authenticated to it remotely.\n\n652\n00:36:33.160 --> 00:36:35.470\nAnd now I've authenticated\nto a compromised machine.\n\n653\n00:36:35.470 --> 00:36:38.530\nThey're not gonna be able to go\nanywhere with my credentials\n\n654\n00:36:38.530 --> 00:36:40.590\nbecause of that restricted admin mode.\n\n655\n00:36:40.590 --> 00:36:44.020\nSo it is more secure,\nit's also a little more limiting so\n\n656\n00:36:44.020 --> 00:36:46.680\njust keep those things in mind.\n&gt;&gt; Perfect, Mike, thank you so much for\n\n657\n00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:50.110\nyour time and thank you for\nyour time as well, but now let's sign out.\n\n658\n00:36:50.110 --> 00:36:52.300\nI've been your host Cherokee Boose.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n659\n00:36:52.300 --> 00:36:54.130\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n660\n00:36:54.130 --> 00:37:00.686\n[MUSIC\n\n661\n00:37:00.686 -->

--> 00:00:05.046\ncoming at you live from\nSan Francisco California.\n\n4\n00:00:05.046 --> 00:00:10.520\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; You're watching IT Pro TV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.751\n&gt;&gt; Welcome everyone to your configure\nWindows devices series studying up for\n\n6\n00:00:15.751 --> 00:00:16.846\nthat 70-697.\n\n7\n00:00:16.846 --> 00:00:19.185\nI'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n8\n00:00:19.185 --> 00:00:23.295\nIn this episode, we'll continue taking a\nlook at how to configure remote access and\n\n9\n00:00:23.295 --> 00:00:26.302\nwith this today, back in the studios,\nwe have Mr. Mike Rodrick.\n\n10\n00:00:26.302 --> 00:00:27.222\nHow's it going Mike?\n\n11\n00:00:27.222 --> 00:00:28.102\n&gt;&gt; It's going great Cherokee.\n\n12\n00:00:28.102 --> 00:00:29.032\nThanks for having me back.\n\n13\n00:00:29.032 --> 00:00:30.112\nExcited as always.\n\n14\n00:00:30.112 --> 00:00:32.392\nAnd yeah remote access good stuff right?\n\n15\n00:00:32.392 --> 00:00:34.282\n&gt;&gt; Yeah you know I was thinking\nabout remote management but\n\n16\n00:00:34.282 --> 00:00:36.382\nwe didn't really talk about\nremote access yet did we?\n\n17\n00:00:36.382 --> 00:00:37.192\n&gt;&gt; We have not.\n\n18\n00:00:37.192 --> 00:00:40.172\nWe have not and\nthat's probably where I want to start is\n\n19\n00:00:40.172 --> 00:00:43.902\nyou know just making sure we're all in the\nsame page as far as terminology goes and\n\n20\n00:00:43.902 --> 00:00:47.250\nunderstanding what they mean when they\ntalk about remote access like we did\n\n21\n00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.190\nan episode, or\na couple of episodes on remote desktop.\n\n22\n00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.430\nAnd some people will try to lump\nthat in with remote access,\n\n23\n00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.610\nand I can kind of see that, but\nyou wanna differentiate a little bit.\n\n24\n00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:01.160\nWhen we talk about\nremote desktop protocol,\n\n25\n00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:06.540\nthat's really a remote control protocol,\nnot necessarily a remote access protocol.\n\n26\n00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.490\nBecause if you think about what's going\non is when you use Remote Desktop\n\n27\n00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.420\nyou're reaching out to a remote machine\n\n28\n00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.420\nthat maybe is already on your\ncorporate network right?\n\n29\n00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.430\nLike your work computer from home, or\n\n30\n00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:21.660\na server in a server closet\nin some other location.\n\n31\n00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:25.340\nYou're reaching out and\nremotely controlling a machine right?\n\n32\n00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.950\nYou're seeing that machine's\ndesktop brought up to you and\n\n33\n00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:29.450\nyou're remotely controlling it.\n\n34\n00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:30.580\nRight?\n\n35\n00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:35.050\nRemote access is more like,\nlet's say you take your laptop and\n\n36\n00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.790\nyou're sitting at home.\n\n37\n00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:41.600\nAnd just imagine if we could take\na really, really long ethernet cable,\n\n38\n00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.900\nrun it from my laptop at home and\nplug it into a switch at work.\n\n39\n00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:46.520\nRight?\n\n40\n00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.370\nI'm not taking over, or controlling any\nmachines on that corporate network.\n\n41\n00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:53.640\nI'm actually adding another\nmachine to the network, right?\n\n42\n00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.220\nI just plugged my laptop even though it's\nmiles of miles away potentially, and\n\n43\n00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:59.885\nplugged it in to the work network.\n\n44\n00:01:59.885 --> 00:02:01.440\nThat's remote access.\n\n45\n00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.690\nYou're accessing the networking remotely.\n\n46\n00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:07.620\nAnd then once you have that access, you\ncan access any resources that you would\n\n47\n00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:10.790\nnormally have access to when\nyou're on the network, assuming or\n\n48\n00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:13.020\ndepending again how they've set it\nup in your corporate environment.\n\n49\n00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.400\nThat's typically what we see.\n\n50\n00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.370\nSo there is slight subtle difference\nbetween a remote control protocol,\n\n51\n00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.670\nlike, remote desktop, and\na remote access protocol like some.\n\n52\n00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.130\nSome of the ones we're\ngonna talk about here.\n\n53\n00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.920\n&gt;&gt; All right, and thanks for clarifying\nbecause even my brain went to that one\n\n54\n00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.490\nwhen we were looking the show,\nthe topic, but yeah, not the same thing.\n\n55\n00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:32.160\n&gt;&gt; It's easy to do.\n\n56\n00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.180\nAnd one part of it, it makes sense.\n\n57\n00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.250\nWell, I am accessing that server\nin the server closet remotely, so\n\n58\n00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:38.250\nit is remote access.\n\n59\n00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.210\nAnd that's why, say, in a way,\nit is, but we do wanna differentiate.\n\n60\n00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:46.680\nThat's remote control protocols versus\nremote access protocols all right?\n\n61\n00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.740\n&gt;&gt; Okay so when we talk about protocols\nwhat are some that we need to know for\n\n62\n00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:50.570\nthis exam Mike?\n\n63\n00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:52.370\n&gt;&gt; There's a few and\nwe're gonna cover them.\n\n64\n00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.920\nI do wanna step back for just a second and\nmake sure, I know I've set Cherokee up for\n\n65\n00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.215\nfailure here, I didn't put any\nof this in my notes [LAUGH] and\n\n66\n00:02:59.215 --> 00:03:01.665\nshe's like this is what we're\ngonna talk about first,\n\n67\n00:03:01.665 --> 00:03:04.625\nand nah I'm gonna change\nit all up on you Cherokee.\n\n68\n00:03:04.625 --> 00:03:05.805\n&gt;&gt; Well that's the fun part.\n\n69\n00:03:05.805 --> 00:03:08.285\n&gt;&gt; Okay good,\nshe's always such a good sport.\n\n70\n00:03:08.285 --> 00:03:09.935\nWe're gonna take a look\nat my screen here and\n\n71\n00:03:09.935 --> 00:03:14.200\nI wanna show you a couple of drawings\nthat I whipped up their fantastic.\n\n72\n00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:18.360\nLuckily they've got a lot of shapes and\nthings that I can cut and\n\n73\n00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.400\npaste in here and use anyway.\n\n74\n00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.820\nBack to the topic at hand.\n\n75\n00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:25.660\nWe are gonna be talking about\nsomething known as VPN, or\n\n76\n00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.470\na virtual private network.\n\n77\n00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.910\nAnd a VPN or virtual private\nnetwork is a remote access protocol\n\n78\n00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:36.730\nthat is gonna allow me to\nestablish this remote connection.\n\n79\n00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:37.400\nAll right.\n\n80\n00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.140\nAnd if we think about it, don't come off\nin the screen for a second actually.\n\n81\n00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.060\nLet's talk about it in general first.\n\n82\n00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:47.030\nWhen we think about being at home,\nor being at the hotel, or\n\n83\n00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:50.510\nbeing at a coffee shop some where,\nor at a conference.\n\n84\n00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:54.750\nAnd I wanna access resources that\nare located back at my cooperate network\n\n85\n00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:56.360\nwherever that may be.\n\n86\n00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:57.910\nHow can I do that?\n\n87\n00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:01.540\nWell, my cooperate network is\nconnected to the internet.\n\n88\n00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:07.520\nWherever I am at home,coffee shop,airport\nI'm connected to the Internet.\n\n89\n00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:09.950\nIf we are both connected to\nthe Internet work and me and\n\n90\n00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:14.280\nthe internet is just one big fat\nmesh network it's it seems to\n\n91\n00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.680\nreason that we should be able to connect\nto that corporate network right?\n\n92\n00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.140\n&gt;&gt; I think so but a lot of us has\nspent a lot of time locking down and\n\n93\n00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:24.220\nsecuring all those remote networks, Mike.\n\n94\n00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:24.725\nSo what do we do?\n\n95\n00:04:24.725 --> 00:04:27.190\n[LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's not quite as easy but\n\n96\n00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:30.780\njsut logically thinking about it,\nthere's definitely a connection or\n\n97\n00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:33.920\nit should be possible and\nit is indeed possible.\n\n98\n00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:37.500\nAnd we'll talk about more on the server\nclasses, we'll talk about like the VPN\n\n99\n00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:42.330\nserver, or a direct access server and ways\nthat we set that up at a corporate side.\n\n100\n00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:46.430\nWe're gonna be focusing a lot\non the client side of things and\n\n101\n00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:48.710\nfrom the users perspective more for\nthis one.\n\n102\n00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:51.050\nBut I do want us to\nunderstand that concept.\n\n103\n00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:54.680\nAnd so what we'll do is we'll set up\nwhat is known as a remote access server.\n\n104\n00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:58.670\nThat can be different technologies like I\nsaid, VPN, direct access, to name a few.\n\n105\n00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:01.880\nBut we set up a remote access\nserver into corporate network and\n\n106\n00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:05.230\nthat remote access server sits on\nthe edge of that corporate network.\n\n107\n00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:07.400\nIt's got two network adapters at least.\n\n108\n00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.240\nOne is gonna be connected\nto the internal network,\n\n109\n00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.830\nto that corporate network the we're\ntrying to gain access to.\n\n110\n00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:16.710\nThe other network adapter it's gonna be\nconnected to the Internet, to the outside,\n\n111\n00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:19.760\nto the public world, and\nthen me from my house,\n\n112\n00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:24.410\nI'm connected to the internet and\nso gonna across the internet and\n\n113\n00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:29.060\nconnect to that public facing interface\non that remote access server, and\n\n114\n00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:33.120\nthen control measures are gonna be put in\nplace to keep it secure and all of that.\n\n115\n00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:36.050\nBut then through that remote access\nserver you can imagine here I am,\n\n116\n00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:37.465\nI am the remote access server.\n\n117\n00:05:37.465 --> 00:05:39.580\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; This one over here is the internet so\n\n118\n00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:42.770\nthat connection is coming in here,\nand that remote access server is gonna\n\n119\n00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:46.440\nallow that traffic to flow into\nthe corporate network, and then back out.\n\n120\n00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:49.170\nSomething like that.\n\n121\n00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:50.270\n&gt;&gt; I'm trying to picture this, and\n\n122\n00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:56.060\nthe center portion of your body is maybe\nthe authentication that's happening.\n\n123\n00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:56.625\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n124\n00:05:56.625 --> 00:06:02.590\nSo now let's take a look at my screen here\nand we'll see different uses for VPNs.\n\n125\n00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:03.140\nRight?\n\n126\n00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:04.790\nLike here somebody sitting at a hotel and\n\n127\n00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:07.910\nthey wanna connect to\ntheir cooperate office.\n\n128\n00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:11.630\nMaybe you're at home,\nmaybe here in a remote office, right?\n\n129\n00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:14.735\nLike a branch office,\nsatellite office, things like that.\n\n130\n00:06:14.735 --> 00:06:18.805\nBut again everybody is connected to that\npublic internet, so we're gonna connect\n\n131\n00:06:18.805 --> 00:06:23.615\nthrough and this will be the VPN\nserver sitting right here, all right.\n\n132\n00:06:23.615 --> 00:06:25.529\nThat's gonna allow that access and\n\n133\n00:06:25.529 --> 00:06:29.753\nallow me to control that access to those\ncorporate resources from the public.\n\n134\n00:06:29.753 --> 00:06:33.411\nBecause l as Cherokee said this is\ndefinitely something that we have to\n\n135\n00:06:33.411 --> 00:06:36.449\nsecure and l just want anybody\ncoming from the internet and\n\n136\n00:06:36.449 --> 00:06:38.440\nconnecting to my corporate network.\n\n137\n00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:39.480\nThat will be insane.\n\n138\n00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:40.000\nAll right.\n\n139\n00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.930\nLet me open up another drawing real quick.\n\n140\n00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:45.870\nLet's see here.\n\n141\n00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:48.760\nI wanna talk about,\nops I think it's the one this one here.\n\n142\n00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:51.530\nAll right.\n\n143\n00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:55.870\nAnd, with this one, I wanna kinda\ntalk about the concepts a little bit.\n\n144\n00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:59.860\nSo we've established that it's pretty\neasily easy, we're both connected\n\n145\n00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:03.770\nthe Internet me or wherever I'm at the\ncorporate network, we should be able to\n\n146\n00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:07.400\nconnect and we can, that's not too\nterribly difficult, all right?\n\n147\n00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:12.050\nBut what we gotta think about is,\nnow I'm gonna be sending and\n\n148\n00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:15.040\nretrieving data from\nthe corporate network and\n\n149\n00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:19.520\nit's all traveling across\nthat public internet right?\n\n150\n00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:22.980\nWhich means there can anybody\ntrying to gain access to that.\n\n151\n00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:24.480\nAnd so, I need to protect it.\n\n152\n00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:27.980\nI need to make sure that as it\ntravels across that public internet,\n\n153\n00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:31.640\nthat it is protected form prying eyes and\nthe bad guys and the bad actors out there,\n\n154\n00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:34.280\nthat are trying to steal this data,\nmanipulate this data,\n\n155\n00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:40.130\ndo whatever it is that they wanna do and\nthat's where VPNs come into play.\n\n156\n00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:43.860\nVPN is a Virtual Private Network.\n\n157\n00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:46.700\nRight it's not really\na private network but\n\n158\n00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:50.130\nwe're going to make\na virtual private network.\n\n159\n00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:55.270\nWe do that using something\nknown as tunneling protocols.\n\n160\n00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:58.620\nRight?\nA tunneling protocol is going to create\n\n161\n00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:00.046\na secure tunnel.\n\n162\n00:08:00.046 --> 00:08:02.482\nRight through that public infrastructure.\n\n163\n00:08:02.482 --> 00:08:04.209\nSo what we will see is\nsomething like this.\n\n164\n00:08:04.209 --> 00:08:07.753\nHere is my computer at home or\nthe airport or wherever I'm at.\n\n165\n00:08:07.753 --> 00:08:10.530\nHere is my connection out to the Internet,\nright?\n\n166\n00:08:10.530 --> 00:08:16.161\nAnd then my cooperate network over here\nhas their DMZ right there screen subnet.\n\n167\n00:08:16.161 --> 00:08:20.550\nThey got this remote access server\nsitting here out in the DMZ typically.\n\n168\n00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:22.778\nIt has one connection out to the Internet.\n\n169\n00:08:22.778 --> 00:08:26.340\nIt has one connection back\ninto the corporate network.\n\n170\n00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:27.948\nThis is what I'm worried about though.\n\n171\n00:08:27.948 --> 00:08:31.098\nAs that data leaves whatever\nnetwork I'm on here, and\n\n172\n00:08:31.098 --> 00:08:35.068\ntravels across the Internet,\nthis is where we have the potential for\n\n173\n00:08:35.068 --> 00:08:38.450\nsomebody to gain access\nto that information.\n\n174\n00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:40.483\nAnd that's where the tunneling\nprotocol comes in.\n\n175\n00:08:40.483 --> 00:08:43.835\nWe can imagine it doing\nsomething like this.\n\n176\n00:08:43.835 --> 00:08:46.230\nNow obviously, we're not going out and\ndigging a tunnel.\n\n177\n00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:49.726\nWe're not laying any private lines,\nleased lines or anything like that.\n\n178\n00:08:49.726 --> 00:08:54.201\nWhat we're going to do is we're\ngoing to encapsulate our traffic.\n\n179\n00:08:54.201 --> 00:08:57.562\nYou can imagine your little\npacket that has your HTTP get or\n\n180\n00:08:57.562 --> 00:09:02.019\nyour file retrieval request or whatever\nit is, your print job your sending,\n\n181\n00:09:02.019 --> 00:09:05.120\nyour SMB share you're trying\nto connect to, right.\n\n182\n00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:08.058\nYour normal packet is gonna\ntravel across the wire and\n\n183\n00:09:08.058 --> 00:09:12.120\nthen we're gonna wrap that up\ninside this tunneling protocol.\n\n184\n00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:15.558\nAnd that's what gives us\nthe privacy that we want, right?\n\n185\n00:09:15.558 --> 00:09:19.660\nIt's that encapsulation of those\npackets within another protocol.\n\n186\n00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:20.684\nYour normal LAN packet or\n\n187\n00:09:20.684 --> 00:09:23.522\nyour normal packet's still inside\nthere using whatever protocol.\n\n188\n00:09:23.522 --> 00:09:28.321\nBut around it again you almost think of it\nlike a layer around it is this tunneling\n\n189\n00:09:28.321 --> 00:09:33.138\nprotocol, and that tunneling protocol\nwill provide the encryption, right?\n\n190\n00:09:33.138 --> 00:09:35.610\nOr the authentication, the integrity for\n\n191\n00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:38.850\nthose packets as they\ntravel across the network.\n\n192\n00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:42.674\nSo it's not like again that we established\nthis super private line going from one\n\n193\n00:09:42.674 --> 00:09:43.639\nplace to the other.\n\n194\n00:09:43.639 --> 00:09:46.300\nWe're just gonna encapsulate those\npackets in a tunneling protocol.\n\n195\n00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:49.917\nSo as they travel across the public\nportion of the network somebody can still\n\n196\n00:09:49.917 --> 00:09:51.623\nintercept those packets, right?\n\n197\n00:09:51.623 --> 00:09:53.890\nWe didn't do anything to protect that.\n\n198\n00:09:53.890 --> 00:09:58.002\nIf they have electrical connectivity to\nthe path that I'm sharing between me and\n\n199\n00:09:58.002 --> 00:10:02.000\nthat remote access server they can most\ndefinitely intercept those packets.\n\n200\n00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.446\nWe can't stop that, but what we can do\nis make sure that when they do intercept\n\n201\n00:10:05.446 --> 00:10:09.280\nthose packets it can't read them,\nright, because they're encrypted.\n\n202\n00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:13.095\nOr they can't modify them because we\nupdated integrity being applied for\n\n203\n00:10:13.095 --> 00:10:13.965\nthose packets.\n\n204\n00:10:13.965 --> 00:10:16.254\nSo that's really what VPN is all about.\n\n205\n00:10:16.254 --> 00:10:19.520\nThat virtual private network\nis creating this tunnel.\n\n206\n00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:23.997\nThis for terminology, for exam,\nthis will be known as a remote access VPN.\n\n207\n00:10:23.997 --> 00:10:28.486\nSingle person over here establishes\na tunnel back to that remote access server\n\n208\n00:10:28.486 --> 00:10:31.752\nwhich then gives them access\nto the corporate network and\n\n209\n00:10:31.752 --> 00:10:34.730\nwhatever resources are available there.\n\n210\n00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:37.704\nIf I had somebody else at a different\nhotel, at a different airport, or\n\n211\n00:10:37.704 --> 00:10:39.637\neven at the same hotel or\nthe same airport, but\n\n212\n00:10:39.637 --> 00:10:41.885\nthey also wanted to make\na remote access connection.\n\n213\n00:10:41.885 --> 00:10:44.862\nLet's say Cherokee and I are both\ntravelling to a conference, right.\n\n214\n00:10:44.862 --> 00:10:48.667\nBoth sitting at the airport waiting for\na plane, I make my VPN tunnel,\n\n215\n00:10:48.667 --> 00:10:52.424\nCherokee will make her own VPN tunnel\nback to the corporate network.\n\n216\n00:10:52.424 --> 00:10:54.284\nThis is a remote access VPN.\n\n217\n00:10:54.284 --> 00:10:57.076\n&gt;&gt; And in this scenario that you\nare giving that will be a temporary\n\n218\n00:10:57.076 --> 00:10:59.972\nconnection, we are not talking\nabout a permanent circuit here or\n\n219\n00:10:59.972 --> 00:11:00.881\nanything, are we?\n\n220\n00:11:00.881 --> 00:11:04.036\n&gt;&gt; Correct, it'd be temporary,\nI'd bring it up when I need it,\n\n221\n00:11:04.036 --> 00:11:05.642\ntear it down when I'm done, and\n\n222\n00:11:05.642 --> 00:11:09.471\nyour remote access server needs to be\nable to handle multiple connections.\n\n223\n00:11:09.471 --> 00:11:13.475\nWell depending on what your scenario\nis again at your organization,\n\n224\n00:11:13.475 --> 00:11:17.580\ncan it handle 2, 5, 25,\n125 simultaneous connections?\n\n225\n00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:20.585\nHow many do you typically have,\nthings like that.\n\n226\n00:11:20.585 --> 00:11:23.969\nBut again that's more of the server side,\nwe're not gonna focus in on that too much,\n\n227\n00:11:23.969 --> 00:11:26.510\nbut I want you to think\nabout these concepts.\n\n228\n00:11:26.510 --> 00:11:30.430\nAnother type that we might see on\nthe exam or get questioned about,\n\n229\n00:11:30.430 --> 00:11:33.020\nwould be what's known\nas a site to site VPN.\n\n230\n00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:36.533\nIn this case, and\nlet me center this a little bit and\n\n231\n00:11:36.533 --> 00:11:38.990\nmove this guy out of the way.\n\n232\n00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:41.864\nI might have my corporate\noffice over here on the left.\n\n233\n00:11:41.864 --> 00:11:46.700\nAgain, DMZ remote access\nserver Internet out here\n\n234\n00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:51.130\nin the middle,\nthen a branch office, right?\n\n235\n00:11:51.130 --> 00:11:54.863\nOr, a remote site over here, but\nthey've got their DMZ setup, and\n\n236\n00:11:54.863 --> 00:11:57.235\nthey've got their remote access server.\n\n237\n00:11:57.235 --> 00:12:01.646\nAnd then between the two remote access\nservers we create a tunnel, and\n\n238\n00:12:01.646 --> 00:12:05.183\nthis one Cherokee would be\none that stays up typically.\n\n239\n00:12:05.183 --> 00:12:06.992\nIt can still be demand dial, but\n\n240\n00:12:06.992 --> 00:12:10.840\na lot of times these are brought\nup as a permanent tunnel.\n\n241\n00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:13.074\nIn this case I could have 5, 10,\n\n242\n00:12:13.074 --> 00:12:17.923\n25 people over here at the branch office\nall going across that same tunnel.\n\n243\n00:12:17.923 --> 00:12:21.031\nSo I have one tunnel established\nbetween the two offices, and\n\n244\n00:12:21.031 --> 00:12:24.556\nthen all of the traffic from\nthe corporate office, to the branch, and\n\n245\n00:12:24.556 --> 00:12:27.620\nback would go through that single tunnel,\nright?\n\n246\n00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:31.972\n&gt;&gt; So Mike this really reminds me\nof our older leased lines from back\n\n247\n00:12:31.972 --> 00:12:36.648\nin the day where companies would go\nahead and set up these dedicated,\n\n248\n00:12:36.648 --> 00:12:41.342\nI'll say permanence, but\nas long as we're paying the ISP, right?\n\n249\n00:12:41.342 --> 00:12:44.280\nAnd we'd have to pay usually by distance,\nand it wasn't very cheap.\n\n250\n00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:49.033\nBut VPN is a way that we can overcome\na lot of those issues that we had\n\n251\n00:12:49.033 --> 00:12:53.963\nin the past, because it's such\na more lightweight installation or\n\n252\n00:12:53.963 --> 00:12:58.478\ntechnology, and it's popular,\nand it works for our needs.\n\n253\n00:12:58.478 --> 00:13:00.130\nSo that's why we see it being used a lot,\nright?\n\n254\n00:13:00.130 --> 00:13:04.958\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, relatively easy to set up,\nand it gives us, as you said,\n\n255\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:09.156\nthe protection that we need and\nthe flexibility that we need.\n\n256\n00:13:09.156 --> 00:13:13.630\nNow, we're talking about Microsoft\nSolutions and we're talking about\n\n257\n00:13:13.630 --> 00:13:18.391\nour server classes, these are gonna\nbe servers running 2016 server, and\n\n258\n00:13:18.391 --> 00:13:22.260\nrunning routing remote access,\nand setting that up.\n\n259\n00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:26.584\nBut, just to be fair that's not\nthe only game in town, right?\n\n260\n00:13:26.584 --> 00:13:29.870\nYou could have a router that\nsupports VPN endpoints.\n\n261\n00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:32.876\nA Cisco device or\nsome other brand Juniper, and so\n\n262\n00:13:32.876 --> 00:13:37.324\nI can take this guy out of the picture and\nreplace it with a router, right?\n\n263\n00:13:37.324 --> 00:13:41.723\nAt the branch office there is a very good\nchance you don't really have a physical\n\n264\n00:13:41.723 --> 00:13:44.758\nserver sitting there running\nrouting remote access.\n\n265\n00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:46.918\nSo it depends, right?\n\n266\n00:13:46.918 --> 00:13:49.281\nThat part can be flexible there.\n\n267\n00:13:49.281 --> 00:13:52.418\nI understand that Microsoft's\nnot the only solution but\n\n268\n00:13:52.418 --> 00:13:55.107\nthat's what we're here\nto learn about anyway.\n\n269\n00:13:55.107 --> 00:13:58.915\nBut the advantage of this again is if I\nhave 50 employees out here at the branch\n\n270\n00:13:58.915 --> 00:14:02.910\noffice, then I don't need 50 tunnels\nbeing made back to the corporate office.\n\n271\n00:14:02.910 --> 00:14:06.042\nI can have one tunnel\nthat supports everybody.\n\n272\n00:14:06.042 --> 00:14:10.553\nOne difference that we want to point out\nbetween remote access and site to sites.\n\n273\n00:14:10.553 --> 00:14:14.092\nThe tunnel, and I know my drawing\nI left it a little gaps here, so\n\n274\n00:14:14.092 --> 00:14:17.174\nwe kinda see that line still\ngoing through that tunnel,\n\n275\n00:14:17.174 --> 00:14:20.470\nalthough we can't really see\nit behind there, all right.\n\n276\n00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:23.435\nBut when we do a remote access VPN,\n\n277\n00:14:23.435 --> 00:14:28.150\nthat traffic is protected as\nsoon as it leaves my node.\n\n278\n00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:32.007\nThe tunnel basically stretches from\nthe network adapter on my laptop or\n\n279\n00:14:32.007 --> 00:14:36.130\nmy computer that I'm using,\nall the way to the remote access server.\n\n280\n00:14:36.130 --> 00:14:38.215\nAnd then it's protected that whole way.\n\n281\n00:14:38.215 --> 00:14:40.867\nIt gets encapsulated as\nit leaves my computer and\n\n282\n00:14:40.867 --> 00:14:44.101\nthat encapsulation gets stripped\noff at the other end, and\n\n283\n00:14:44.101 --> 00:14:48.770\nit's allowed to enter into the corporate\nnetwork as a normal LAN packet, all right?\n\n284\n00:14:48.770 --> 00:14:51.900\nBut it's protected all the way\nbetween those two end points.\n\n285\n00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:55.932\n&gt;&gt; So what you're saying is an attacker\nmay be able to see that a communication is\n\n286\n00:14:55.932 --> 00:15:00.089\nhappening but they just can't see what\ntype of communication is transpiring or\n\n287\n00:15:00.089 --> 00:15:02.337\ngoing over that virtual private network.\n\n288\n00:15:02.337 --> 00:15:05.527\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and if I wanted to make my\ndrawing a little more accurate I should\n\n289\n00:15:05.527 --> 00:15:07.840\nbring this tunnel right into that server.\n\n290\n00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:10.403\nAnd, bring this tunnel\nright into that device or\n\n291\n00:15:10.403 --> 00:15:12.411\nthat node that we're using, right.\n\n292\n00:15:12.411 --> 00:15:17.417\nSo, protection end to end,\nwhere site to site the tunnel is gonna\n\n293\n00:15:17.417 --> 00:15:22.860\nspread from VPN end point to VPN\nend point but not over here, right.\n\n294\n00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:26.888\nSo, when that traffic leaves my\nnode on a site to site type VPN,\n\n295\n00:15:26.888 --> 00:15:31.677\nit's not gonna be encapsulated until\nit gets to the remote access server.\n\n296\n00:15:31.677 --> 00:15:33.910\nOr whatever it is we're using for\nthat VPN endpoint.\n\n297\n00:15:33.910 --> 00:15:36.508\nThat's when it's gonna pick\nup that encapsulation,\n\n298\n00:15:36.508 --> 00:15:40.302\nprotected all the way to the other end,\nand then the encapsulation is removed.\n\n299\n00:15:40.302 --> 00:15:42.925\nAnd it's a plain old packet after that.\n\n300\n00:15:42.925 --> 00:15:47.832\n&gt;&gt; So then that's with the assumption that\nthose two remote sites are handling their\n\n301\n00:15:47.832 --> 00:15:48.906\nlocal security.\n\n302\n00:15:48.906 --> 00:15:50.414\n&gt;&gt; Yes, exactly.\n\n303\n00:15:50.414 --> 00:15:53.830\nSomebody had access to the LAN over here,\nthat traffic is unprotected.\n\n304\n00:15:53.830 --> 00:15:58.757\nBut we're making the assumption that\nthis is a trusted secured network and\n\n305\n00:15:58.757 --> 00:16:01.740\nI don't to secure the traffic Here, right.\n\n306\n00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:04.944\nI'm not worried about a coworker\nintercepting the information,\n\n307\n00:16:04.944 --> 00:16:08.619\nI'm worried about a bad guy out here\ntrying to intercept that information.\n\n308\n00:16:08.619 --> 00:16:10.208\nIt's not to say that we can't, right.\n\n309\n00:16:10.208 --> 00:16:14.941\nYou could set up a tunnel from this node,\nall the way to this device or\n\n310\n00:16:14.941 --> 00:16:16.780\neven inside here really.\n\n311\n00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:19.617\nWe can do this in several different ways,\nbut\n\n312\n00:16:19.617 --> 00:16:23.210\nin general this is the way a site\nto site VPN is gonna look.\n\n313\n00:16:23.210 --> 00:16:25.168\nAnd typically we're\nperfectly fine with that.\n\n314\n00:16:25.168 --> 00:16:27.555\nWe don't want the over\nhead of the encryption,\n\n315\n00:16:27.555 --> 00:16:29.413\nthe encapsulation occurring here.\n\n316\n00:16:29.413 --> 00:16:33.508\nWe just need to protect it as it travels\nbetween the parts that we don't have\n\n317\n00:16:33.508 --> 00:16:37.668\ncontrol over, or the bad guys makes it\neasy for them to intercept that data,\n\n318\n00:16:37.668 --> 00:16:38.329\nall right?\n\n319\n00:16:38.329 --> 00:16:41.573\nSo some background information\nthere on routing mode,\n\n320\n00:16:41.573 --> 00:16:45.782\nthat one is routing mode access were\nreally just about VPNs in general and\n\n321\n00:16:45.782 --> 00:16:49.246\nsome concepts that we need to\nbe familiar with, all right.\n\n322\n00:16:49.246 --> 00:16:54.197\nNow, finally, back to Cherokee's original\nquestion, which if you remember was,\n\n323\n00:16:54.197 --> 00:16:56.411\nwhat protocols are we talking about?\n\n324\n00:16:56.411 --> 00:16:57.387\n&gt;&gt; How does this all work?\n\n325\n00:16:57.387 --> 00:16:59.156\nWhat's hiding underneath that tunnel,\nMike.\n\n326\n00:16:59.156 --> 00:17:00.864\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, what the heck is going on,\nall right?\n\n327\n00:17:00.864 --> 00:17:02.996\nAnd you can kill my screen for\njust a little bit and\n\n328\n00:17:02.996 --> 00:17:06.639\nI'll let you know when we come back, we'll\ntake a look at my Windows 10 machine.\n\n329\n00:17:06.639 --> 00:17:10.146\nBut when we talk about\ntunneling protocols,\n\n330\n00:17:10.146 --> 00:17:15.960\nthere's really four big ones that we\nneed to worry about for this exam, and\n\n331\n00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:21.242\nthey're gonna be what's known as PPTP,\nL2TP, IKEv2 and SSTP.\n\n332\n00:17:21.242 --> 00:17:22.102\n&gt;&gt; What language is that?\n\n333\n00:17:22.102 --> 00:17:23.084\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, exactly.\n\n334\n00:17:23.084 --> 00:17:24.017\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n335\n00:17:24.017 --> 00:17:25.359\nI just took a can of alphabet soup.\n\n336\n00:17:25.359 --> 00:17:29.044\nI dumped it out on the desk here and\nI did the whole tea leaf thing and\n\n337\n00:17:29.044 --> 00:17:30.258\nI'm reading it now.\n\n338\n00:17:30.258 --> 00:17:33.043\n&gt;&gt; But these are the ones that I\nactually am glad we have acronyms for\n\n339\n00:17:33.043 --> 00:17:36.623\nbecause they get a little redundant\nlike Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol.\n\n340\n00:17:36.623 --> 00:17:42.543\n&gt;&gt; Yes, well especially when you start\nsaying PPTP uses PPP is built in MPPE for\n\n341\n00:17:42.543 --> 00:17:43.661\nencryption.\n\n342\n00:17:43.661 --> 00:17:44.317\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n343\n00:17:44.317 --> 00:17:46.056\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right.\n\n344\n00:17:46.056 --> 00:17:48.233\nAnd honestly it's just fun to say.\n\n345\n00:17:48.233 --> 00:17:49.681\nI always like saying that.\n\n346\n00:17:49.681 --> 00:17:51.017\nBut let's break them down.\n\n347\n00:17:51.017 --> 00:17:57.210\nSo PPTP as Cherokee said is\nPoint-to-Point Tunneling Protocol, right?\n\n348\n00:17:57.210 --> 00:17:59.244\nThis is an old tunneling protocol.\n\n349\n00:17:59.244 --> 00:18:02.622\nIt has been around for a long, long time.\n\n350\n00:18:02.622 --> 00:18:05.567\nUses for\nauthentication MS-CHAP version one,\n\n351\n00:18:05.567 --> 00:18:08.020\nversion two is a little bit older there.\n\n352\n00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:12.436\nIt does support EAP,\nmy Extensible Authentication Protocol.\n\n353\n00:18:12.436 --> 00:18:15.891\nPEAP my Protected Extensible\nAuthentication Protocol.\n\n354\n00:18:15.891 --> 00:18:20.502\nThese are the authentication methods\nthat I can use if I choose to do PPTP.\n\n355\n00:18:20.502 --> 00:18:22.514\nAnd let's back up for a second.\n\n356\n00:18:22.514 --> 00:18:23.873\nWhen we talk about PPTP or\n\n357\n00:18:23.873 --> 00:18:28.604\nPoint-to-Point Tunneling Protocol we're\ntalking about what protocol am I using to\n\n358\n00:18:28.604 --> 00:18:32.506\nestablish that tunnel, that green\nthing that I had on those drawings.\n\n359\n00:18:32.506 --> 00:18:34.610\nWhat is doing the encapsulation?\n\n360\n00:18:34.610 --> 00:18:36.535\nWhat are we wrapping those packets in?\n\n361\n00:18:36.535 --> 00:18:39.296\nPPTP is one choice.\n\n362\n00:18:39.296 --> 00:18:42.431\nThings we need to be familiar with\nto the exam, the acronym itself,\n\n363\n00:18:42.431 --> 00:18:44.576\nPPTP Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol,\n\n364\n00:18:44.576 --> 00:18:46.783\nthe authentication\nmethods that it supports.\n\n365\n00:18:46.783 --> 00:18:51.093\nMS-CHAP v1 v2 EAP Extensible\nAuthentication Protocol PEAP,\n\n366\n00:18:51.093 --> 00:18:53.219\nI just like saying that one too.\n\n367\n00:18:53.219 --> 00:18:53.798\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n\n368\n00:18:53.798 --> 00:19:00.242\n&gt;&gt; Protected Extensible Authentication\nProtocol, and it travels over port 1723.\n\n369\n00:19:00.242 --> 00:19:04.725\nAnd that's important to know because\non my corporate network, and\n\n370\n00:19:04.725 --> 00:19:09.364\nout there in that branch office,\nI've got control of the firewalls,\n\n371\n00:19:09.364 --> 00:19:13.786\nthe routers, and all of that stuff,\nthe clients, the machines.\n\n372\n00:19:13.786 --> 00:19:15.002\nWe can make those exceptions, right?\n\n373\n00:19:15.002 --> 00:19:18.508\nI can open up those ports and\nallow that protocol to work.\n\n374\n00:19:18.508 --> 00:19:22.727\nI can run into issues if I have to\ngo through any routers out there in\n\n375\n00:19:22.727 --> 00:19:27.040\nthe public that don't support or\nare not allowing port 1723.\n\n376\n00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:28.068\nMost of them do, but\n\n377\n00:19:28.068 --> 00:19:32.057\nyou might find scenarios where you can't\nget it to work and it very well could be\n\n378\n00:19:32.057 --> 00:19:35.994\nbecause something in between your two\nend points is blocking port 1723.\n\n379\n00:19:35.994 --> 00:19:38.553\n&gt;&gt; So, Mike if that's one thing or\nobstacle,\n\n380\n00:19:38.553 --> 00:19:42.841\nI may encounter to prohibit me from\nusing one protocol over the other but,\n\n381\n00:19:42.841 --> 00:19:46.115\nwhat are some other factors\nthat I would want to choose?\n\n382\n00:19:46.115 --> 00:19:50.978\nAre all these protocols created equal,\nam I gonna just reach out of a grab\n\n383\n00:19:50.978 --> 00:19:52.820\nbag here or-\n&gt;&gt; Definitely not.\n\n384\n00:19:52.820 --> 00:19:55.895\nIt's gonna be about\nthe protocols being used and\n\n385\n00:19:55.895 --> 00:20:00.180\nthe authentication methods and\nthe protection that they provide.\n\n386\n00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:03.141\nPPTP, another thing we should\nbe familiar with is it does\n\n387\n00:20:03.141 --> 00:20:05.312\nhave built in encryption capabilities.\n\n388\n00:20:05.312 --> 00:20:10.195\nIt actually uses Microsoft Point-to-Point\nEncryption, which is part of PPP or\n\n389\n00:20:10.195 --> 00:20:12.258\nthe Point-to-Point Protocol.\n\n390\n00:20:12.258 --> 00:20:13.959\nThis is what I was saying earlier.\n\n391\n00:20:13.959 --> 00:20:17.910\nPPTP uses PPP's built in MPPE.\n\n392\n00:20:17.910 --> 00:20:19.147\nI just like saying that.\n\n393\n00:20:19.147 --> 00:20:22.856\nBut if we break it down, PPTP,\nPoint-to-Point Tunneling Protocol is based\n\n394\n00:20:22.856 --> 00:20:25.286\noff of PPP,\nPoint-to-Point Protocol, right.\n\n395\n00:20:25.286 --> 00:20:28.220\nWe just added tunneling\nto that capability.\n\n396\n00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:31.755\nPPP uses\nMicrosoft's Point-to-Point Encryption.\n\n397\n00:20:31.755 --> 00:20:34.856\nWhich means PPTP has the ability\nto encrypt traffic and\n\n398\n00:20:34.856 --> 00:20:36.552\nthat's gonna be important.\n\n399\n00:20:36.552 --> 00:20:40.682\nIf we're thinking about what\nprotocol we wanna choose to create\n\n400\n00:20:40.682 --> 00:20:45.042\nthis tunnel if encryption is one\nof my requirements PPTP will work,\n\n401\n00:20:45.042 --> 00:20:48.268\nall right,\nbecause it does provide encryption.\n\n402\n00:20:48.268 --> 00:20:49.480\nNot the strongest of encryptions.\n\n403\n00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:50.373\nThat's one of the things.\n\n404\n00:20:50.373 --> 00:20:55.017\nThis is an older protocol,\nyou probably won't use it as much any more\n\n405\n00:20:55.017 --> 00:20:59.437\nbecause the encryption methods\nare a little bit on the weak side.\n\n406\n00:20:59.437 --> 00:21:05.482\nNext I wanna talk about is Layer\n2 Tunneling Protocol or L2TP.\n\n407\n00:21:05.482 --> 00:21:10.942\nLayer 2 Tunneling Protocol is\na little bit newer than PPTP but\n\n408\n00:21:10.942 --> 00:21:15.459\nstill an oldie,\nit's been around for a long time.\n\n409\n00:21:15.459 --> 00:21:20.863\nThings that we wanna understand about\nL2TP is it goes over port 1701,\n\n410\n00:21:20.863 --> 00:21:24.209\nit can use preshared keys and\ncertificates for\n\n411\n00:21:24.209 --> 00:21:27.576\nauthentication as well\nas the other methods.\n\n412\n00:21:27.576 --> 00:21:34.118\nL2TP does not have a built\nin encryption method,\n\n413\n00:21:34.118 --> 00:21:38.181\nand you think that's stupid.\n\n414\n00:21:38.181 --> 00:21:39.829\n&gt;&gt; Why would I create the tunnel?\n\n415\n00:21:39.829 --> 00:21:41.208\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, why would you, right?\n\n416\n00:21:41.208 --> 00:21:42.861\nWhy would you use L2TP?\n\n417\n00:21:42.861 --> 00:21:44.981\nL2TP does have the ability to encrypt.\n\n418\n00:21:44.981 --> 00:21:49.754\nI just wanna stress the fact that\nit's really leveraging IPSEC,\n\n419\n00:21:49.754 --> 00:21:55.241\nIPSEC Internet Protocol Security is\nwhat we use to encrypt L2TP traffic.\n\n420\n00:21:55.241 --> 00:22:01.127\nYou almost see L2TP written L2TP/IPSEC.\n\n421\n00:22:01.127 --> 00:22:03.080\nBecause we're gonna combine those two.\n\n422\n00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:07.018\nI want that tunneling protocol,\nI really need to be able to encrypt it.\n\n423\n00:22:07.018 --> 00:22:08.961\nL2TP doesn't have a way to do it,\n\n424\n00:22:08.961 --> 00:22:13.327\nIPSEC brought along with it gives me\nthe ability to provide that encryption.\n\n425\n00:22:13.327 --> 00:22:16.315\n&gt;&gt; So we just got to go the extra\nmile to make sure we're utilizing\n\n426\n00:22:16.315 --> 00:22:17.870\nthe full protocol suite there.\n\n427\n00:22:17.870 --> 00:22:18.392\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n428\n00:22:18.392 --> 00:22:20.174\n&gt;&gt; Not just one individual protocol.\n\n429\n00:22:20.174 --> 00:22:23.228\n&gt;&gt; Definitely wanna think about\nhow am I setting this up, and\n\n430\n00:22:23.228 --> 00:22:25.798\nhow do I include that IPSEC in there,\nall right?\n\n431\n00:22:25.798 --> 00:22:31.720\nPort 1701 again DES and\nTriple DES can be used for our encryption.\n\n432\n00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:33.816\nThat just goes to show you how old it is,\nright?\n\n433\n00:22:33.816 --> 00:22:35.164\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If I say DES-\n\n434\n00:22:35.164 --> 00:22:37.799\n&gt;&gt; That goes all the way back to the 70s\n\n435\n00:22:37.799 --> 00:22:38.997\nfor DES, yeah.\n\n436\n00:22:38.997 --> 00:22:41.719\n&gt;&gt; It's a little on the old side\nyou don't see it that much.\n\n437\n00:22:41.719 --> 00:22:46.834\nBut it's still a protocol choice\nwhen we look at creating our VPNs.\n\n438\n00:22:46.834 --> 00:22:48.757\nAnd it's an easy one PPTP and\n\n439\n00:22:48.757 --> 00:22:52.612\nL2TP for their weaknesses\nthey're very easy to set up.\n\n440\n00:22:52.612 --> 00:22:56.508\nThey're not very complex\nin setup requirements and\n\n441\n00:22:56.508 --> 00:23:00.766\nthings like that, so\nyou will still see them being used.\n\n442\n00:23:00.766 --> 00:23:02.735\nThat's still available in Windows 10,\nright?\n\n443\n00:23:02.735 --> 00:23:07.682\nAll right,\nthe next one on my list here is SSTP or\n\n444\n00:23:07.682 --> 00:23:11.538\nSecure Socket Tunneling Protocol.\n\n445\n00:23:11.538 --> 00:23:16.699\nAnd Cherokee, does that secure\nsocket make you think of anything?\n\n446\n00:23:16.699 --> 00:23:17.990\n&gt;&gt; It sounds secure Mike.\n\n447\n00:23:17.990 --> 00:23:19.785\n&gt;&gt; It does sound secure, right?\n\n448\n00:23:19.785 --> 00:23:22.584\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Can you think of anything else thta\n\n449\n00:23:22.584 --> 00:23:24.358\nuses SS or Secure Socket?\n\n450\n00:23:24.358 --> 00:23:25.894\n&gt;&gt; Secure Socket.\n\n451\n00:23:25.894 --> 00:23:27.658\nMan, you put me on the spot.\n\n452\n00:23:27.658 --> 00:23:28.631\n&gt;&gt; SSL.\n\n453\n00:23:28.631 --> 00:23:29.482\n&gt;&gt; SSL.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n454\n00:23:29.482 --> 00:23:30.308\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Secure Socket Layer.\n\n455\n00:23:30.308 --> 00:23:34.231\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and\nwhen we talk about encrypting web Traffic,\n\n456\n00:23:34.231 --> 00:23:36.563\nwe use SSL secure socket, right?\n\n457\n00:23:36.563 --> 00:23:41.706\nSSTP is a tunneling protocol,\nbuilt upon that, right.\n\n458\n00:23:41.706 --> 00:23:47.170\nIt's gonna use SSL as it's protection\nmethod in a way to create that tunnel.\n\n459\n00:23:47.170 --> 00:23:51.230\nIf I say that it's just like HTTPS, well,\nI shouldn't say it's just like it but\n\n460\n00:23:51.230 --> 00:23:52.496\nit's similar, right.\n\n461\n00:23:52.496 --> 00:23:57.222\nIt's using SSL just like HTTPS\ndoes What port number do\n\n462\n00:23:57.222 --> 00:23:59.796\nyou think it might go across?\n\n463\n00:23:59.796 --> 00:24:00.777\n&gt;&gt; 443?\n\n464\n00:24:00.777 --> 00:24:06.240\n&gt;&gt; 443, exactly right,\ngold star because that is SSL right?\n\n465\n00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:07.736\nThat's our port number for that.\n\n466\n00:24:07.736 --> 00:24:12.921\nSo secure socket tunneling protocol,\nSSTP, uses SSL for encryption,\n\n467\n00:24:12.921 --> 00:24:17.937\nEAP, extensible authentication\nprotocol for its authentication.\n\n468\n00:24:17.937 --> 00:24:18.793\nAlso, EAPTLS,\n\n469\n00:24:18.793 --> 00:24:22.658\nwhich is Extensible Authentication\nProtocol Transport Layer Security.\n\n470\n00:24:22.658 --> 00:24:24.250\n&gt;&gt; Transport Layer Security.\n\n471\n00:24:24.250 --> 00:24:25.410\n&gt;&gt; Yep, TLS.\n\n472\n00:24:25.410 --> 00:24:28.675\nUses certificates for its authentication.\n\n473\n00:24:28.675 --> 00:24:30.722\nWe're talking about\nauthenticating that tunnel.\n\n474\n00:24:30.722 --> 00:24:33.662\nAnd again, port 443,\n\n475\n00:24:33.662 --> 00:24:39.282\na big advantage of that,\nbecause it uses 443.\n\n476\n00:24:39.282 --> 00:24:42.895\nCuz we talked about how PPTP uses 1723.\n\n477\n00:24:42.895 --> 00:24:46.359\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; L2TP uses 1701, that's another uncommon\n\n478\n00:24:46.359 --> 00:24:51.326\nport, not one that we normally open up in\nour firewalls unless we really need it.\n\n479\n00:24:51.326 --> 00:24:55.514\nWhich means I can have issues if I'm\nbouncing across any portion of any router\n\n480\n00:24:55.514 --> 00:24:58.615\nthat I don't have control over,\nI might have a problem.\n\n481\n00:24:58.615 --> 00:25:02.301\n443 however is open on almost all of them,\n\n482\n00:25:02.301 --> 00:25:06.476\nwe almost always see 443\nopen because of HTTPS.\n\n483\n00:25:06.476 --> 00:25:11.454\nSo now we're leveraging a port that's\nopen on almost all routers out there.\n\n484\n00:25:11.454 --> 00:25:16.263\nSo it's gonna make it a lot\neasier in that respect.\n\n485\n00:25:16.263 --> 00:25:18.391\nIt is a little more difficult to set up.\n\n486\n00:25:18.391 --> 00:25:22.800\nWe have to issue out certificates for\nthe authentication portion and\n\n487\n00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:24.024\nthings like that.\n\n488\n00:25:24.024 --> 00:25:28.259\nSo it's a little bit more difficult to\nset up comparatively to the other ones.\n\n489\n00:25:28.259 --> 00:25:31.651\nBut if you've got certificate\nservices in place, if you have\n\n490\n00:25:31.651 --> 00:25:35.776\na certificate authority infrastructure,\nyou should be good to go there.\n\n491\n00:25:35.776 --> 00:25:41.784\nLast one we're gonna mention here\nis something known as IKE v2 or\n\n492\n00:25:41.784 --> 00:25:45.398\nInternet key exchange, version two.\n\n493\n00:25:45.398 --> 00:25:48.292\nI always just say, IKE v2,\nI think that's what most people say.\n\n494\n00:25:48.292 --> 00:25:49.052\n&gt;&gt; Mike and Ike?\n\n495\n00:25:49.052 --> 00:25:50.156\n&gt;&gt; Mike and Ike, yes.\n\n496\n00:25:50.156 --> 00:25:53.730\nOne of my faves, every time we go to\nthe movies we gotta have Mike and Ike's.\n\n497\n00:25:53.730 --> 00:25:55.467\nBut yeah, I say, IKE version two.\n\n498\n00:25:55.467 --> 00:25:57.522\nI think that's a common\nway to pronounce it.\n\n499\n00:25:57.522 --> 00:25:58.761\nIf not, I'm making it up and\n\n500\n00:25:58.761 --> 00:26:01.988\nyou guys should say it lots sothat\neverybody in the world starts using it.\n\n501\n00:26:01.988 --> 00:26:03.942\nBut IKE v2, I'm kidding, right?\n\n502\n00:26:03.942 --> 00:26:07.068\nIt's been around for a long time,\nit is pronounced IKEv2.\n\n503\n00:26:07.068 --> 00:26:10.243\nIt is the default for Windows 10,\nI'll throw that out there first.\n\n504\n00:26:10.243 --> 00:26:17.564\nIt uses EAP for,\n&gt;&gt; Authentication?\n\n505\n00:26:17.564 --> 00:26:19.003\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm talking way too fast.\n\n506\n00:26:19.003 --> 00:26:19.659\n&gt;&gt; Well I like.\n\n507\n00:26:19.659 --> 00:26:21.233\n&gt;&gt; EAP?\n\n508\n00:26:21.233 --> 00:26:26.328\n&gt;&gt; EAP, yes, because it supports\na multi factor authentication and\n\n509\n00:26:26.328 --> 00:26:29.335\nit's very flexible, hence the name.\n\n510\n00:26:29.335 --> 00:26:30.201\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n511\n00:26:30.201 --> 00:26:32.788\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But if you think about having a lot of\n\n512\n00:26:32.788 --> 00:26:37.776\ndifferent ways that we can go ahead and\nauthenticate nowadays and having cat cards\n\n513\n00:26:37.776 --> 00:26:42.928\nlike you've mentioned in previous shows\nand different types of mechanisms there.\n\n514\n00:26:42.928 --> 00:26:46.321\nJust because passwords aren't\nalways going to be good enough.\n\n515\n00:26:46.321 --> 00:26:47.848\n&gt;&gt; No, absolutely not, and\n\n516\n00:26:47.848 --> 00:26:52.508\nextensible authentication protocol allows\nthird parties to modify or add on.\n\n517\n00:26:52.508 --> 00:26:57.139\nExtensible, we can extend\nthe functionality of that authentication\n\n518\n00:26:57.139 --> 00:26:57.930\nprotocol.\n\n519\n00:26:57.930 --> 00:27:00.985\nBut it does support EAP,\nextensible authentication protocol.\n\n520\n00:27:00.985 --> 00:27:03.054\nPEAP, not that this will be on this exam,\nbut\n\n521\n00:27:03.054 --> 00:27:05.954\nPEAP is just protected extensible\nauthentication protocol.\n\n522\n00:27:05.954 --> 00:27:10.930\nThere is a portion of the EAP negotiation\nthat's unprotected at the very beginning\n\n523\n00:27:10.930 --> 00:27:12.789\nof the security negotiation.\n\n524\n00:27:12.789 --> 00:27:14.580\nPEAP adds protection to that.\n\n525\n00:27:14.580 --> 00:27:17.233\nProtected Extensible\nAuthentication Protocol.\n\n526\n00:27:17.233 --> 00:27:24.794\nEAP MS Chat v2 and Smart Cards are my\nauthentication choices with my IKEV2.\n\n527\n00:27:24.794 --> 00:27:29.781\nNow there are some cool things with\nIKEV2 that are not provided by\n\n528\n00:27:29.781 --> 00:27:31.510\nthe other protocols.\n\n529\n00:27:31.510 --> 00:27:32.649\nAnd I wanna point those out, and\n\n530\n00:27:32.649 --> 00:27:34.856\nwe'll talk a little bit more\nabout those in our next episode.\n\n531\n00:27:34.856 --> 00:27:36.487\nI know we're getting short on time here.\n\n532\n00:27:36.487 --> 00:27:39.103\nBut it is one, the default for Windows 10.\n\n533\n00:27:39.103 --> 00:27:40.502\nI think I mentioned that already.\n\n534\n00:27:40.502 --> 00:27:47.011\nAnd it is the,\nIt uses a mobile IKE or MobIKE I\n\n535\n00:27:47.011 --> 00:27:51.863\ncan't remember how to say that, I'll\nhave to make sure I double check that.\n\n536\n00:27:51.863 --> 00:27:54.709\nMobiKey, I feel like\nI'm getting that wrong.\n\n537\n00:27:54.709 --> 00:27:55.817\nI'll double check on that.\n\n538\n00:27:55.817 --> 00:28:02.457\nBut one of the great features of IKEv2\nis something known as VPN reconnect.\n\n539\n00:28:02.457 --> 00:28:06.017\nAnd this is an easy question for\nthem to ask you on the exam.\n\n540\n00:28:06.017 --> 00:28:11.737\nSo let's talk about what it is, and then\nwe'll say that it is supported by IKEv2.\n\n541\n00:28:11.737 --> 00:28:16.496\nWhen I establish a VPN connection, let's\nsay I'm at the hotel and I double click on\n\n542\n00:28:16.496 --> 00:28:20.783\nmy VPN icon and I connect to my work,\nwherever that is, and I access files.\n\n543\n00:28:20.783 --> 00:28:25.354\nIf I lose connectivity, in other words,\nif the hotel's wireless flakes out for\n\n544\n00:28:25.354 --> 00:28:27.853\na minute and\nI drop my Internet connection.\n\n545\n00:28:27.853 --> 00:28:31.644\nWell, obviously I'm gonna lose\nmy VPN connection as well.\n\n546\n00:28:31.644 --> 00:28:34.896\nThe hotel's wireless comes back\non in the next 30 seconds,\n\n547\n00:28:34.896 --> 00:28:36.844\nmy VPN connection is lost, though.\n\n548\n00:28:36.844 --> 00:28:40.263\nI lost the connectivity and\nit dropped that connection.\n\n549\n00:28:40.263 --> 00:28:43.938\nSo as soon as the hotel wireless comes\nback up, I'm gonna have to go back in and\n\n550\n00:28:43.938 --> 00:28:45.936\nreestablish that connection manually.\n\n551\n00:28:45.936 --> 00:28:51.483\nJust double click on my VPN icon,\nauthenticate all over again and connect.\n\n552\n00:28:51.483 --> 00:28:56.406\nWith IKEv2 we support VPN reconnect.\n\n553\n00:28:56.406 --> 00:29:00.277\nAnd that means as soon as I,\nwe've got the same scenario,\n\n554\n00:29:00.277 --> 00:29:04.397\nhotel, established a connection,\nthis time using IKEv2.\n\n555\n00:29:04.397 --> 00:29:07.963\nHotel's Internet freaks out,\nI lose connectivity for a minute.\n\n556\n00:29:07.963 --> 00:29:12.125\nIt comes back up,\nIKEv2 automatically reconnects.\n\n557\n00:29:12.125 --> 00:29:15.886\nAs soon as I've re-established Internet\nconnectivity, it's gonna attempt\n\n558\n00:29:15.886 --> 00:29:19.431\nto reconnect my VPN connection,\nhands off, I don't have to do anything.\n\n559\n00:29:19.431 --> 00:29:20.526\n&gt;&gt; MOBIKE was correct.\n\n560\n00:29:20.526 --> 00:29:21.214\n&gt;&gt; MOBIKE, okay.\n\n561\n00:29:21.214 --> 00:29:24.111\n&gt;&gt; All capitals, M-O-B-I-K-E.\n\n562\n00:29:24.111 --> 00:29:26.216\n&gt;&gt; I-K-E yes, okay,\nI was trying to think of the best way.\n\n563\n00:29:26.216 --> 00:29:28.239\nI was like, is it MOBIKE or Mobile IKE?\n\n564\n00:29:28.239 --> 00:29:29.518\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But yeah, I think they combine\n\n565\n00:29:29.518 --> 00:29:30.234\nthose two there.\n\n566\n00:29:30.234 --> 00:29:31.836\nThank you, Cherokee.\n\n567\n00:29:31.836 --> 00:29:34.397\nAnd where was I going with that?\n\n568\n00:29:34.397 --> 00:29:36.517\nSo it automatically reconnects.\n\n569\n00:29:36.517 --> 00:29:38.833\nAnd that's really a convenience factor.\n\n570\n00:29:38.833 --> 00:29:42.322\nThe example I used, with the hotel thing,\nit's convenient, right?\n\n571\n00:29:42.322 --> 00:29:44.341\nI didn't have to go in and\ndouble-click my icon.\n\n572\n00:29:44.341 --> 00:29:48.310\nThe other places it really\ncomes in a play is for roaming.\n\n573\n00:29:48.310 --> 00:29:51.730\nThink about this, you're on a mobile\ndevice and you're walking around.\n\n574\n00:29:51.730 --> 00:29:54.445\nMaybe you've got a campus for\nyour corporate office or\n\n575\n00:29:54.445 --> 00:29:56.758\nsomething like that,or\njust a large office.\n\n576\n00:29:56.758 --> 00:29:59.930\nAs you move from one wireless\naccess point to the other,\n\n577\n00:29:59.930 --> 00:30:01.820\nas you roam across your network,\n\n578\n00:30:01.820 --> 00:30:06.290\nthere's that hand off process that occurs\nfrom one access point to the other.\n\n579\n00:30:06.290 --> 00:30:08.588\nWe can temporarily lose connectivity.\n\n580\n00:30:08.588 --> 00:30:11.864\nAnd if I do that,\nI would lose a standard VPN connection.\n\n581\n00:30:11.864 --> 00:30:16.654\nSo here I am on my tablet, maybe I've got\na VPN connection going, I'm roaming and\n\n582\n00:30:16.654 --> 00:30:17.289\nit drops.\n\n583\n00:30:17.289 --> 00:30:18.770\nNow we've got to reconnect and\n\n584\n00:30:18.770 --> 00:30:22.704\nre-establish everything I was connected\nto, all my resources, what have you.\n\n585\n00:30:22.704 --> 00:30:25.828\nWith IKEv2 and\nMOBIKE that process is automatic and\n\n586\n00:30:25.828 --> 00:30:28.464\nhandled transparently behind the scenes.\n\n587\n00:30:28.464 --> 00:30:29.240\n&gt;&gt; Seamless.\n\n588\n00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:34.192\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so that's really convenient,\nit's a lot more challenging to set\n\n589\n00:30:34.192 --> 00:30:37.788\nup as far as configuring these,\nbut we'll take a look.\n\n590\n00:30:37.788 --> 00:30:42.507\nAgain, we don't really go as far into\nthe setup, that's more of the server side.\n\n591\n00:30:42.507 --> 00:30:46.281\nBut we will take a look at the client side\nof things, and how we choose the protocols\n\n592\n00:30:46.281 --> 00:30:49.148\nthere, and what we need to do\nto set up those VPN connections.\n\n593\n00:30:49.148 --> 00:30:52.468\n&gt;&gt; Which is cool because\nin a lot of environments,\n\n594\n00:30:52.468 --> 00:30:55.877\nyou usually only set up\nthat access server once.\n\n595\n00:30:55.877 --> 00:30:59.190\nAnd then all of your employees or\nclients that are connecting,\n\n596\n00:30:59.190 --> 00:31:03.083\nthat's a lot more of a common task,\nso I'm glad we get to see that, Mike.\n\n597\n00:31:03.083 --> 00:31:04.435\nThank you for your time today.\n\n598\n00:31:04.435 --> 00:31:07.219\nThank you for your time as well,\nbut for now let's sign out.\n\n599\n00:31:07.219 --> 00:31:08.571\nI've been your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n600\n00:31:08.571 --> 00:31:09.419\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n601\n00:31:09.419 -->

You are watching ITProTV.\n&gt;&gt; Welcome everyone to\n\n5\n00:00:12.904 --> 00:00:17.910\nyour Configuring Windows Devices series,\nstudying up for that 70-697 exam.\n\n6\n00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.360\nI'm your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:23.700\nWe're here with a part two,\nlooking at how to configure remote access.\n\n8\n00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:27.770\nAnd with us today, back in the studios,\nwe have Mr. Mike Rodrick.\n\n9\n00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:29.382\nHow is it going today, Mike?\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic.\n\n10\n00:00:29.382 --> 00:00:31.610\nCherokee, thanks for having me back and\nyes, double time, right?\n\n11\n00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:32.610\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we talked about it,\n\n12\n00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.000\nnow it's like go time, right?\n&gt;&gt; It is go time, so\n\n13\n00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.707\nwe are gonna take a look at,\nfrom the client perspective.\n\n14\n00:00:37.707 --> 00:00:39.839\nAnd a little bit on the server side, but\n\n15\n00:00:39.839 --> 00:00:43.050\nhow we go about configuring\na VPN connection, right?\n\n16\n00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.640\nOr what we would call a VPN profile.\n\n17\n00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.428\nAll right, so let's just dive right in,\ntake a look at my screen here, I've got\n\n18\n00:00:49.428 --> 00:00:53.470\na Windows 10 box, things have changed\na little bit, obviously with Windows 10.\n\n19\n00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:56.036\nSo if you've done this before\nat older operating systems,\n\n20\n00:00:56.036 --> 00:00:59.082\nit's a little bit different as far\nas where we go, what we're doing.\n\n21\n00:00:59.082 --> 00:01:00.434\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] imagine that.\n\n22\n00:01:00.434 --> 00:01:01.261\n&gt;&gt; I know it's crazy, right?\n\n23\n00:01:01.261 --> 00:01:02.750\nGo figure.\n\n24\n00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.609\nBut let me start by going a long way.\n\n25\n00:01:05.609 --> 00:01:08.099\nSo I'm gonna go to my\nStart menu down here,\n\n26\n00:01:08.099 --> 00:01:11.834\nI'll click on my little gear icon\nto bring on Window settings and\n\n27\n00:01:11.834 --> 00:01:15.583\nthen I'm gonna click on the network and\nthe internet category.\n\n28\n00:01:15.583 --> 00:01:20.423\nAnd you'll see that takes me obviously\nto my network and internet and then\n\n29\n00:01:20.423 --> 00:01:25.510\nI've got a node here or a pane, if you\nwill or a blade that I can choose for VPN.\n\n30\n00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:29.292\nAnd I've already set one up cuz remember,\nI told you IKE can be a little bit of\n\n31\n00:01:29.292 --> 00:01:31.970\na challenge to get set up on\nthe server side of things.\n\n32\n00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.089\nI wanted to check it, make sure it was\nworking before I came on screen and\n\n33\n00:01:36.089 --> 00:01:37.130\nshowed you guys.\n\n34\n00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:42.820\nSo we'll take a look at that one as well,\nas it create some additional ones.\n\n35\n00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.780\nI'll show you on\nthe server side of things,\n\n36\n00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.160\nI have my domain controllers up and\nrunning.\n\n37\n00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:48.860\nHe's in the background running.\n\n38\n00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.600\nThis is my remote access server,\nserver 01.\n\n39\n00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.850\nAnd if we take a look at\nhis network configuration,\n\n40\n00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.844\nwe'll see that I have\ntwo network adapters.\n\n41\n00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:04.329\nI've got one connected to my\ndomain network, lab.itpro.tv,\n\n42\n00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:07.810\nthe other one is connected\nto the public network.\n\n43\n00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.392\nSo we go back to my little thing,\nI got one connected to the inside,\n\n44\n00:02:10.392 --> 00:02:11.930\none connected to the outside, right?\n\n45\n00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.860\nAnd I'd be like that wouldn't be Cherokee.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, those are your little interfaces\n\n46\n00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.937\nthat are on remember that one.\n&gt;&gt; Each one of my little interfaces\n\n47\n00:02:17.937 --> 00:02:20.281\nexactly, jazz hands yeah, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n48\n00:02:20.281 --> 00:02:21.049\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n49\n00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:23.110\nwe got that set up I also have.\n\n50\n00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.120\nIn the Microsoft world nowadays,\nwe've got remote access launched, or\n\n51\n00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.630\nrouting remote access let's just say,\ninstalled as a whole.\n\n52\n00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.438\nI've got my routing remote access,\nand it's already been configured and\n\n53\n00:02:35.438 --> 00:02:38.945\nif you wanna learn more about\nconfiguring the remote access server,\n\n54\n00:02:38.945 --> 00:02:42.710\nthen you will jump into our 2012 or\n2016 episodes in our library.\n\n55\n00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:48.780\nBut it is set up and he's listening for\nthat inbound VPN connection.\n\n56\n00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.650\nI also have an NPS node or\nmy Network Policy Server,\n\n57\n00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.280\nthis is where you control, right?\n\n58\n00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.480\nCherokee had talked about how it seems\nlike it would be important to control\n\n59\n00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:59.332\nthis access.\n\n60\n00:02:59.332 --> 00:03:02.700\nNow I want just anybody\ncreating their VPN connection,\n\n61\n00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.340\nwhich is where my network policy server\ncomes in to play, and my network policies.\n\n62\n00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.780\nAnd I've created a very simple\npolicy that allows all domain users\n\n63\n00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.490\nto establish a remote access connection.\n\n64\n00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:18.190\nAgain, just for these demos,\nnormally they'd be a little more\n\n65\n00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.280\nstrict about who can access and when\nthey can access, and things like that.\n\n66\n00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.290\nWe might only want my remote sales people\naccessing in during business hours.\n\n67\n00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.010\nThey don't have any need to be\non the network after hours,\n\n68\n00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:30.610\nwhen maintenance is going on, whatever.\n\n69\n00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:32.680\nBut again,\nthat's more the service side of thing,\n\n70\n00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.590\nwe're not gonna go into\ncreating those policies.\n\n71\n00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.370\nI just wanted to show you that they're\nthere, this doesn't work by magic,\n\n72\n00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.130\nsomebody has to setup the remote\naccess server, right.\n\n73\n00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:45.520\nIs a client server model right,\nso we've got a server set up and\n\n74\n00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:48.390\nnow we're gonna take a look\nat the client side of things.\n\n75\n00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.734\nAll right, so in here,\nwe've got our VPN and\n\n76\n00:03:50.734 --> 00:03:54.030\nyou can see there's a link here\nthat says add a VPN connection.\n\n77\n00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:58.580\nSo we will simply click\non add VPN connection.\n\n78\n00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:03.120\nAnd we get this new fancy\nWindows 10 interface.\n\n79\n00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.810\nAlthough I don’t know why I have getting\ngray bars across there, but it’s okay.\n\n80\n00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:09.290\nAnd the first box says VPN Provider.\n\n81\n00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:12.320\nIf I click that,\nyou’ll see I have a lot of choices.\n\n82\n00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:16.629\nI have Windows built in and,\n&gt;&gt; That's it.\n\n83\n00:04:16.629 --> 00:04:17.830\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's it.\n\n84\n00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:20.280\nAll right, that's all we get.\n\n85\n00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:24.839\nThere is just about this is it's important\nto understand that Windows has a built in\n\n86\n00:04:24.839 --> 00:04:25.500\nVPN client.\n\n87\n00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:30.300\nSo I don't need any extra software,\nnot to say that we couldn't.\n\n88\n00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:35.730\nThere are several vendors that\nprovide third party VPN clients that\n\n89\n00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:40.080\nyou can install, and your organization\nmight very well need one of those, right?\n\n90\n00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.550\nDepending on your remote access\nsolution that you're using.\n\n91\n00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:47.200\nIf you're using a Cisco device\nto act as your VPN endpoint,\n\n92\n00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:51.560\nyou might need that Cisco VPN client\nrunning on your client machines.\n\n93\n00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:54.900\nIn which case,\nyou would even restore the group policy or\n\n94\n00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.660\nas part of your image or what have you.\n\n95\n00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:01.890\nAnd then it would show up in this drop\ndown list and you would choose that.\n\n96\n00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:04.750\nSo just understand,\nWindows has one built in.\n\n97\n00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:06.890\nWe can also use third party clients.\n\n98\n00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.300\nNext box down is the connection name.\n\n99\n00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:12.300\nHere you're gonna type either the name or\n\n100\n00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:15.820\nthe IP address of that\nremote access server, right?\n\n101\n00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:19.840\nWe wanna connect to that public\ninterface on that VPN server.\n\n102\n00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:24.292\nWhen we think about this,\nwhen we configure this,\n\n103\n00:05:24.292 --> 00:05:30.240\nwe need to know if we can use a name or\nwe have to use an IP address.\n\n104\n00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:34.200\nWhen I'm at the corporate network, right,\nand I'm connected to the corporate\n\n105\n00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:38.900\nnetwork, I've gotten DHCP most likely\nfrom the corporate network and\n\n106\n00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:43.050\nit's provided me with an IP address,\na subnet mask, a default gateway.\n\n107\n00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:47.060\nAnd a DNS server address to use\nwhile I'm connected to that network.\n\n108\n00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:51.180\nThat DNS server is gonna be most likely\nour corporate DNS server who would be able\n\n109\n00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:54.720\nto resolve any of the corporate names,\nthe names of our different machines,\n\n110\n00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:56.750\nwhat have you into IP addresses.\n\n111\n00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:02.990\nCode names would work fine but\nwhen I'm at home, I got DHCP from my ISP,\n\n112\n00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:06.790\nCox Communications, Brighthouse,\nwhomever you're using.\n\n113\n00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:10.540\nThere, you are gonna get an IP\naddress from a subnet that is valid\n\n114\n00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:12.910\non that ISP's network.\n\n115\n00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:15.330\nAnd most likely, a DNS server\nthat is controlled by that ISP.\n\n116\n00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:19.884\nAnd that DNS server is not gonna be\nable to resolve internal names from your\n\n117\n00:06:19.884 --> 00:06:21.730\ncorporate network, right.\n\n118\n00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:26.790\nSo one or two things has to\nhappen here for this to work.\n\n119\n00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:29.950\nOne, your organization\nwould have made publicly.\n\n120\n00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:34.960\nYou might have a DNS server that's public\nfacing that does host the name and\n\n121\n00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:38.580\nresource record for\nthe public side of your VPN server.\n\n122\n00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:42.672\nSo that from the public, you can resolve\nthe name into that public IP address,\n\n123\n00:06:42.672 --> 00:06:46.448\nthat would be one way you could do it.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so even if I was at home and\n\n124\n00:06:46.448 --> 00:06:49.803\nI was relying on that ISP DNS\nserver because it was public,\n\n125\n00:06:49.803 --> 00:06:52.753\nI'd still be able to see that info?\n&gt;&gt; Exactly,\n\n126\n00:06:52.753 --> 00:06:55.691\njust like when we set up mail and\nyou might not be familiar with this.\n\n127\n00:06:55.691 --> 00:07:01.053\nBut when you set up like you mail client,\nyou might type in mail.itpro.tv, right and\n\n128\n00:07:01.053 --> 00:07:06.197\nmy organization just make sure that public\nDNS servers have that resource record,\n\n129\n00:07:06.197 --> 00:07:10.530\nand can resolve it into the public\nfacing IP address of my front end of my\n\n130\n00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:13.840\nexchange set up, or\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n131\n00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:19.520\nOr when you set up your ISP mail,\nyou've got smtp.mail.cox.net or\n\n132\n00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:23.880\nwhat have you, because that's publicly\nresolvable into an IP address.\n\n133\n00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:28.020\nIf it's not, right, if your company or\norganization hasn't done that and you\n\n134\n00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:31.880\ncan't resolve that name from the outside,\nthen you would need to use an IP address.\n\n135\n00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:35.990\nYou would need to know the public IP\naddress, think back to the drawing and\n\n136\n00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:40.270\nmy little hands there, right, you need to\nknow that public IP, not the private one.\n\n137\n00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:43.610\nNot the one that is connected to\nthe intranet because you can't get to that\n\n138\n00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:44.720\nfrom the outside.\n\n139\n00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:49.630\nYou need the IP address of the public\nfacing network adapter on that VPN server.\n\n140\n00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:50.790\nAll right, and you would type\nthat in here. So in my case,\n\n141\n00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:56.249\nI've actually added a host record but\nthat's a whole another story,\n\n142\n00:07:56.249 --> 00:07:59.220\nor I'm sorry, a name in my host file.\n\n143\n00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:02.361\nBut I will use,\nwhat I should I use, IP addresses?\n\n144\n00:08:02.361 --> 00:08:06.276\nLet's do IP address, 192 168.2.101,\n\n145\n00:08:06.276 --> 00:08:11.237\nI know that's not a public address,\nthis is a little test network.\n\n146\n00:08:11.237 --> 00:08:14.282\nThe corporate network is a 10 10 network,\nand\n\n147\n00:08:14.282 --> 00:08:19.375\nI'm pretending that the 1921682 dot\nnetwork is the Internet, all right?\n\n148\n00:08:19.375 --> 00:08:23.481\nI know it's not a publicly routable IP\naddress if you guys are going what use\n\n149\n00:08:23.481 --> 00:08:24.207\nis private?\n\n150\n00:08:24.207 --> 00:08:26.166\nIt's just for this lab environment, right?\n\n151\n00:08:26.166 --> 00:08:30.513\nSo that I can simulate being not connected\nfrom to the corporate network and\n\n152\n00:08:30.513 --> 00:08:32.449\nhaving it come from the outside.\n\n153\n00:08:32.449 --> 00:08:41.075\nSo 1921682.101 is the public facing\nnetwork adapter on my VPN server.\n\n154\n00:08:41.075 --> 00:08:43.711\nAnd I just realized that I actually\nput that in the wrong box.\n\n155\n00:08:43.711 --> 00:08:47.039\nConnection name versus server name or\nIP address, all right?\n\n156\n00:08:47.039 --> 00:08:49.809\nLet's move that down to here.\n\n157\n00:08:49.809 --> 00:08:51.978\nBecause that is the server name or\nIP address.\n\n158\n00:08:51.978 --> 00:08:55.322\nThe connection name is\nsimply a friendly name.\n\n159\n00:08:55.322 --> 00:08:58.208\nYou could call it whatever you want, work,\n\n160\n00:08:58.208 --> 00:09:02.501\nhappy go lucky connection,\nyou could call it whatever you want.\n\n161\n00:09:02.501 --> 00:09:05.794\nYou might have more than\none VPN connection, right?\n\n162\n00:09:05.794 --> 00:09:09.622\nThis VPN is for connecting to the\ncorporate office, this VPN profile is for\n\n163\n00:09:09.622 --> 00:09:12.863\nconnecting to the branch office,\nor whatever the case may be.\n\n164\n00:09:12.863 --> 00:09:15.575\nSo give it a friendly name,\ncall it whatever you want.\n\n165\n00:09:15.575 --> 00:09:18.643\nHere is where I wanna type\nin either the name, or\n\n166\n00:09:18.643 --> 00:09:22.338\nthe IP address of that remote\naccess server, all right?\n\n167\n00:09:22.338 --> 00:09:24.552\nAnd, we'd need to be a fully\nqualified domain name, right?\n\n168\n00:09:24.552 --> 00:09:28.853\nNot just server 01,\nserver 01.lab.ItPro.tv, or\n\n169\n00:09:28.853 --> 00:09:30.790\nwhatever the case maybe.\n\n170\n00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:36.370\nRight below that I have my VPN type,\nand you see it defaults to automatic.\n\n171\n00:09:36.370 --> 00:09:40.465\nIf I hit this drop down list,\nthat should look familiar.\n\n172\n00:09:40.465 --> 00:09:42.662\nThose names look familiar?\n&gt;&gt; Hm.\n\n173\n00:09:42.662 --> 00:09:43.466\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n174\n00:09:43.466 --> 00:09:44.260\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n175\n00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:44.878\n&gt;&gt; Only if you've\n\n176\n00:09:44.878 --> 00:09:46.597\nwatched our previously episode, right?\n\n177\n00:09:46.597 --> 00:09:50.461\nPPTP, Point to Point Tunneling Protocol,\nL2TP/IPsec,\n\n178\n00:09:50.461 --> 00:09:54.185\nremember how I said they almost\nalways write it like that.\n\n179\n00:09:54.185 --> 00:09:59.682\nUsing certificates, that would mean I\nwould need a certificate issued to me,\n\n180\n00:09:59.682 --> 00:10:01.681\nL2tpi with preshared key,\n\n181\n00:10:01.681 --> 00:10:06.195\nI would need to know the appropriate\npassword or preshared key.\n\n182\n00:10:06.195 --> 00:10:11.702\nSSTP secure socket tunneling protocol,\nor IKEv2.\n\n183\n00:10:11.702 --> 00:10:14.001\nI'm gonna leave it on automatic and\n\n184\n00:10:14.001 --> 00:10:19.147\nwe'll talk about in just a second what\nautomatic actually means or does for me.\n\n185\n00:10:19.147 --> 00:10:23.827\nBut in some scenarios you might be told or\nyou might be the one that set this up,\n\n186\n00:10:23.827 --> 00:10:27.571\nand your remote access server is going to,\nlet's go ahead and\n\n187\n00:10:27.571 --> 00:10:29.809\ntalk about it now while we're here.\n\n188\n00:10:29.809 --> 00:10:34.132\nYour remote access server when it's\nsetup you can define what protocols it\n\n189\n00:10:34.132 --> 00:10:35.165\nallows, right?\n\n190\n00:10:35.165 --> 00:10:40.713\nSome of these protocols are older, they\ndon't, they're not as secure, like PPTP.\n\n191\n00:10:40.713 --> 00:10:44.078\nI might not want any of my\nusers using that protocol, so\n\n192\n00:10:44.078 --> 00:10:48.258\nI might tell my remote access server\nyou're not allowed to do that.\n\n193\n00:10:48.258 --> 00:10:54.525\nYou only support IKE, SSTP and L2TP,\nor some combination thereof, right?\n\n194\n00:10:54.525 --> 00:10:58.726\nSo whoever set up the remote access\nserver is gonna determine what protocols\n\n195\n00:10:58.726 --> 00:11:00.375\nare allowed to connect to it.\n\n196\n00:11:00.375 --> 00:11:03.114\nMight be all of them where you\ncould use anyone you want.\n\n197\n00:11:03.114 --> 00:11:04.006\nMight only be one.\n\n198\n00:11:04.006 --> 00:11:09.005\nYou might have to know that your remote\naccess server only supports L2TP\\IPSec\n\n199\n00:11:09.005 --> 00:11:11.072\nusing pre-shared key, right?\n\n200\n00:11:11.072 --> 00:11:14.012\nIn which case you could choose\nit here you would also need to\n\n201\n00:11:14.012 --> 00:11:15.398\nknow the pre-shared key.\n\n202\n00:11:16.926 --> 00:11:19.356\nWhen you leave it on automatic,\n\n203\n00:11:19.356 --> 00:11:23.586\nwhat Windows 10 will do is\nit will try them all, okay?\n\n204\n00:11:23.586 --> 00:11:29.020\nBecause you're saying I don't know ,or\nyou're saying I'm trying to remember what\n\n205\n00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:34.538\nI said, you're basically leaving it up to\nWindows to determine what protocol to use.\n\n206\n00:11:34.538 --> 00:11:38.464\nAnd what Windows 10 will do is when it\nattempts to make this connection it will\n\n207\n00:11:38.464 --> 00:11:40.551\ncycle through the different protocols.\n\n208\n00:11:40.551 --> 00:11:43.247\nIt will use the strongest one first, and\n\n209\n00:11:43.247 --> 00:11:48.493\nwork its way down until it finds one that\nthe remote access server will accept.\n\n210\n00:11:48.493 --> 00:11:53.431\nAnd you have the proper information\nto establish that connection.\n\n211\n00:11:53.431 --> 00:11:56.835\nStart IKEV2, remember I said\nthat was default for Windows 10?\n\n212\n00:11:56.835 --> 00:11:59.177\nWhat that means is that's\nthe first one it tries.\n\n213\n00:11:59.177 --> 00:12:03.060\nWhen you leave it on automatic,\nwhen you type in the name or\n\n214\n00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:08.389\nIP address of the server, it's gonna\nattempt to connect to that using IKEV2.\n\n215\n00:12:08.389 --> 00:12:11.629\nIf the server is set up\nto accept IKE requests,\n\n216\n00:12:11.629 --> 00:12:15.951\nand you have the appropriate\nauthentication information and\n\n217\n00:12:15.951 --> 00:12:21.033\nconfiguration on your machine to make\nthat connection, it will use it.\n\n218\n00:12:21.033 --> 00:12:24.670\nIf the server is not set up\nto accept IKEv2, or it is but\n\n219\n00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:28.942\nyou don't have the right certificate\nto make that connection,\n\n220\n00:12:28.942 --> 00:12:32.440\nWindow says okay, I tried IKE,\nthat didn't work.\n\n221\n00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:33.840\nLet's just move down the list.\n\n222\n00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:35.773\nThat's what automatic is gonna do for you,\n\n223\n00:12:35.773 --> 00:12:39.656\nit's gonna cycle through all the protocols\nattempting to establish that connection.\n\n224\n00:12:39.656 --> 00:12:44.541\nSo it's very hardy when you don't know\nwhat protocols are being accepted,\n\n225\n00:12:44.541 --> 00:12:48.359\nor you connect to different\nservices at different times and\n\n226\n00:12:48.359 --> 00:12:52.201\nyou wanna just let it negotiate\nthe strongest one, right?\n\n227\n00:12:52.201 --> 00:12:56.801\nThat is the idea and\nbasically it's IKE first,\n\n228\n00:12:56.801 --> 00:13:00.718\nthen SSTP, then L2TP, and then PPTP.\n\n229\n00:13:00.718 --> 00:13:03.182\nDouble check, I think those last\ntwo are in the right order,\n\n230\n00:13:03.182 --> 00:13:04.593\nsometimes I get those backwards.\n\n231\n00:13:04.593 --> 00:13:08.186\nBut again I don't think it's a question\nthey would get you on the exam, but\n\n232\n00:13:08.186 --> 00:13:11.971\nit goes from strongest to weakest, and\nso you can try the strongest one first.\n\n233\n00:13:11.971 --> 00:13:17.984\nWhich is IP 2, and then SSTP,\nthe L2TP, and then PPTP, all right?\n\n234\n00:13:17.984 --> 00:13:20.849\nAnd then whichever one works,\nit stops, right?\n\n235\n00:13:20.849 --> 00:13:24.063\nBecause if IKE doesn't work, and\nit tries SSTP and that works,\n\n236\n00:13:24.063 --> 00:13:26.696\nit's gonna go ahead and\nestablish the connection.\n\n237\n00:13:26.696 --> 00:13:30.338\nIt won't try L2TP or PPTP, right?\n\n238\n00:13:30.338 --> 00:13:34.033\nCuz it already found the strongest\none that both ends support and\n\n239\n00:13:34.033 --> 00:13:35.478\nallow that connection.\n\n240\n00:13:35.478 --> 00:13:39.110\nSo, automatic is convenient just\nbecause as I'm setting up this profile,\n\n241\n00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:40.198\nI don't have to know.\n\n242\n00:13:40.198 --> 00:13:42.431\nYou might have instructions printed up for\n\n243\n00:13:42.431 --> 00:13:45.407\nyour users on how to go through\nthis little dialogue, and\n\n244\n00:13:45.407 --> 00:13:48.771\njust telling them automatic or\nleave the defaults is very easy.\n\n245\n00:13:48.771 --> 00:13:52.500\nOr if we change what protocol\nwe're using our VPN server.\n\n246\n00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:57.315\nWe were using L2TP but only because we\ndidn't have our certificate's services\n\n247\n00:13:57.315 --> 00:13:59.878\ninfrastructure setup yet to support IKE.\n\n248\n00:13:59.878 --> 00:14:02.927\nNow we do and\nwe want people to start using IKE.\n\n249\n00:14:02.927 --> 00:14:05.406\nIf I leave this on automatic\non all my clients,\n\n250\n00:14:05.406 --> 00:14:07.769\nI don't have to go\nreconfigure any of them.\n\n251\n00:14:07.769 --> 00:14:13.455\nIf I had set that to L2TP, all right, with\npre-shared key or something like that,\n\n252\n00:14:13.455 --> 00:14:18.281\nand now we upgrade our infrastructure\nto support our IKE, guess what?\n\n253\n00:14:18.281 --> 00:14:22.347\nI have got to either walk my users\nthrough changing this option,\n\n254\n00:14:22.347 --> 00:14:25.905\nediting their profile, or\nreconfiguring it for them.\n\n255\n00:14:25.905 --> 00:14:29.775\nI'll leave it on Automatic, they don't\nhave to change anything as I upgrade my\n\n256\n00:14:29.775 --> 00:14:32.068\nRemote Access Infrastructure\n&gt;&gt; Good to know.\n\n257\n00:14:32.068 --> 00:14:32.616\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n258\n00:14:32.616 --> 00:14:33.119\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n259\n00:14:33.119 --> 00:14:33.639\n&gt;&gt; Makes sense, makes it easy for\n\n260\n00:14:33.639 --> 00:14:34.883\nus and that's the goal, right?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n261\n00:14:34.883 --> 00:14:37.441\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's the least administrative effort,\n\n262\n00:14:37.441 --> 00:14:38.682\nas Microsoft likes to say.\n\n263\n00:14:38.682 --> 00:14:42.785\nAll right, below that,\ntype of sign-in information.\n\n264\n00:14:42.785 --> 00:14:48.581\nUser name and password, Smart card,\nOne-time password OTP or Certificate.\n\n265\n00:14:48.581 --> 00:14:52.336\nAgain this is gonna be based on\nwhat protocol you're using and\n\n266\n00:14:52.336 --> 00:14:55.383\nwhat they have set up on\nthe remote access server.\n\n267\n00:14:55.383 --> 00:14:57.148\nThis is information you\nwould have to know.\n\n268\n00:14:57.148 --> 00:14:59.999\nYou can't guess,\nsomebody would have to tell you hey,\n\n269\n00:14:59.999 --> 00:15:03.287\nif you wanna establish a VPN connection,\nhere is what you need.\n\n270\n00:15:03.287 --> 00:15:07.511\nA client, here is the IP Address or the\nname, here is the protocol we want to use\n\n271\n00:15:07.511 --> 00:15:11.993\nor leave it on automatic, and you're gonna\nneed your work username and password.\n\n272\n00:15:11.993 --> 00:15:15.247\nOr, you need to bring in your machine so\nwe can issue you a certificate.\n\n273\n00:15:15.247 --> 00:15:18.711\nOr we're gonna email you a one-time\npassword, yeah hopefully not,\n\n274\n00:15:18.711 --> 00:15:22.049\nthat's probably not a good idea.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they have the little key fobs\n\n275\n00:15:22.049 --> 00:15:25.514\nmaybe, or even on your phone you can\nget one-time passwords sent to you, or\n\n276\n00:15:25.514 --> 00:15:29.833\nsomething like that.\n&gt;&gt; Or like with the military,\n\n277\n00:15:29.833 --> 00:15:31.974\nI know CAD right?\n\n278\n00:15:31.974 --> 00:15:35.738\nUsually, well, my wife for example,\nshe's Coast Guard Reserves.\n\n279\n00:15:35.738 --> 00:15:37.895\nThey allow her to remote in sometimes.\n\n280\n00:15:37.895 --> 00:15:42.926\nShe has a CAC reader, so she plugs\nin via USB, and then uses her CAC or\n\n281\n00:15:42.926 --> 00:15:45.823\nsomeone's access card.\n&gt;&gt; That version of a smart\n\n282\n00:15:45.823 --> 00:15:48.329\ncard but remotely.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, couldn't think of the name of\n\n283\n00:15:48.329 --> 00:15:51.650\nthe, they're smart cards, they call\nthem CACs or common access cards.\n\n284\n00:15:51.650 --> 00:15:53.956\nThat has a certificate loaded on it,\nshe pops that in there,\n\n285\n00:15:53.956 --> 00:15:55.504\nand it allows that connection, right?\n\n286\n00:15:55.504 --> 00:16:00.609\nBut again, information you would need\nto know ahead of time to set this up,\n\n287\n00:16:00.609 --> 00:16:01.431\nall right?\n\n288\n00:16:01.431 --> 00:16:04.842\nAnd then you could go ahead and\ntype in your user name And your password.\n\n289\n00:16:04.842 --> 00:16:08.043\nIf I zoom back out and\nI scroll down a bit here,\n\n290\n00:16:08.043 --> 00:16:12.830\nyou see it does have the option\nto remember my sign-in info.\n\n291\n00:16:12.830 --> 00:16:15.930\nYou guys have seen shows with me\nto know that I hate those options,\n\n292\n00:16:15.930 --> 00:16:18.000\nso am not going to do it.\n\n293\n00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.451\nBecause I don't want you to see\nme do anything crazy like that.\n\n294\n00:16:21.451 --> 00:16:23.759\nAnd I'll go and click Save.\n\n295\n00:16:23.759 --> 00:16:28.627\nAnd now, I have the VPN profile\nsitting here called, Work, all right?\n\n296\n00:16:28.627 --> 00:16:32.560\nWhen it's time to connect,\nif I wanna connect to that,\n\n297\n00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:36.674\nI'll simply select this and\nchoose connect, all right?\n\n298\n00:16:36.674 --> 00:16:39.480\nNow, let me see what we wanna do next.\n\n299\n00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:41.560\nI wanna show you, well, let's do this.\n\n300\n00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:45.380\nI want to make sure, one,\nI'm on the right network.\n\n301\n00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:47.700\nSo IP config real quick.\n\n302\n00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:49.519\nAnd I am on the 192.\n\n303\n00:16:49.519 --> 00:16:54.440\nSo notice the IP address of\nmy client is 192.168.2.52.\n\n304\n00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:56.783\nSo am on the Internet, right?\n\n305\n00:16:56.783 --> 00:17:01.608\nAnd I'm out at that hotel,\nI'm not on my domain network.\n\n306\n00:17:01.608 --> 00:17:04.389\nThis is the 10.10 network, all right?\n\n307\n00:17:04.389 --> 00:17:08.737\nAnd so, I am gonna simply,\nactually, let me show you first.\n\n308\n00:17:08.737 --> 00:17:12.200\nIf I try to connect to,\nI don't know, let's see.\n\n309\n00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:15.590\nSVR, I don't know if he\nhas any shares on there.\n\n310\n00:17:15.590 --> 00:17:17.770\nDC01 does, or 03.\n\n311\n00:17:17.770 --> 00:17:19.175\nIf I try to connect, and\n\n312\n00:17:19.175 --> 00:17:23.606\nI'm just trying to connect to a machine\nthat's on the corporate network,\n\n313\n00:17:23.606 --> 00:17:28.340\nit's not gonna work because I'm not\nconnected to the proper network, right?\n\n314\n00:17:28.340 --> 00:17:30.831\nI'm out at some hotel somewhere,\nnot connected.\n\n315\n00:17:30.831 --> 00:17:34.060\nI'm connected to Internet,\nbut not the proper network.\n\n316\n00:17:34.060 --> 00:17:36.131\nNow, it looks like it connected, but\n\n317\n00:17:36.131 --> 00:17:40.429\nthis is only because I have offline files\nconfigured from a previous episode.\n\n318\n00:17:40.429 --> 00:17:44.590\nSo you see I have the whole some files\nare available, some files are not.\n\n319\n00:17:44.590 --> 00:17:46.906\nThat's because I have a copy\nof them cached locally.\n\n320\n00:17:46.906 --> 00:17:49.340\nBut you saw how long it took.\n\n321\n00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:54.115\nIt was attempting to connect to the\nserver, it failed, and then it said, well,\n\n322\n00:17:54.115 --> 00:17:58.343\nlet me see if you have anything cached\nlocally and I'll show you those.\n\n323\n00:17:58.343 --> 00:18:02.351\nI'm not connected, I could, I guess\na better test would be to ping DCO3.\n\n324\n00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:09.001\nWhich, I'm not even gonna get name\nresolution at this point because I'm not\n\n325\n00:18:09.001 --> 00:18:13.130\nconnected to the corporate network,\nI'm not connected to that NDS server.\n\n326\n00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:17.687\nIf I try to ping 10.10.8.203,\nwhich is my DNS server.\n\n327\n00:18:17.687 --> 00:18:20.858\nI'm not on the right network.\n\n328\n00:18:20.858 --> 00:18:23.640\nI don't have a default gateway and\nall that stuff, so it's not gonna work.\n\n329\n00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:25.800\nThe point is, I am not connected.\n\n330\n00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:29.630\nAll right, so now, I am going to connect.\n\n331\n00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:32.490\nI'll click Connect, and\nI get my sign in information.\n\n332\n00:18:32.490 --> 00:18:34.770\nI will put my user name.\n\n333\n00:18:34.770 --> 00:18:39.690\nI'm gonna use the pre-Windows\n2000 format here.\n\n334\n00:18:39.690 --> 00:18:44.003\nYou could do mike@lab.itpro.tv,\nright, or lab/mike.\n\n335\n00:18:44.003 --> 00:18:44.950\nAnd I'll click Connect.\n\n336\n00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:47.290\nAnd you can see it is connecting to.\n\n337\n00:18:47.290 --> 00:18:49.650\nand hopefully that will work and connect.\n\n338\n00:18:49.650 --> 00:18:51.940\nSo we'll give it just a second.\n\n339\n00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:52.936\nIf not, we'll troubleshoot it.\n\n340\n00:18:52.936 --> 00:18:54.260\nSee what's going on here.\n\n341\n00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:58.850\nI've had a couple glitches because\nI've been trying to set up multiple\n\n342\n00:18:58.850 --> 00:19:02.500\nprotocols and multiple connections.\n&gt;&gt; Sometimes I've found that if you\n\n343\n00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:07.860\ndisconnect and then disable and\nreenable the actual adapter,\n\n344\n00:19:07.860 --> 00:19:10.920\nthen it will allow that connection\nto happen here for a VPN.\n\n345\n00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:12.780\nIt's just like a Windows thing, but-\n&gt;&gt; It\n\n346\n00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:13.510\nwill.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n347\n00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:15.835\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, all right, so it didn't\n\n348\n00:19:15.835 --> 00:19:20.648\nconnect, but the error I got was,\nI should have left that up for a second.\n\n349\n00:19:20.648 --> 00:19:22.470\nThere's one more thing I need to show you.\n\n350\n00:19:24.048 --> 00:19:25.700\nOr many more things, actually,\n\n351\n00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:28.590\nthat I need to show you.\n&gt;&gt; When you set up, when we\n\n352\n00:19:28.590 --> 00:19:32.490\nran through this wizard, we didn't have\na lot of options, VPN provider, right?\n\n353\n00:19:32.490 --> 00:19:34.210\nThat was the Windows built in.\n\n354\n00:19:34.210 --> 00:19:37.050\nIP address or name of the server.\n\n355\n00:19:37.050 --> 00:19:39.055\nWhat I wanted to use, automatic, right?\n\n356\n00:19:39.055 --> 00:19:41.870\nWhich, it cycled through all of them.\n\n357\n00:19:41.870 --> 00:19:44.900\nSo and that's all the options we get.\n\n358\n00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:50.390\nI need to check my authentication methods.\n&gt;&gt; What's a good way to say this?\n\n359\n00:19:50.390 --> 00:19:54.390\nOn the VPN server, whoever set that up,\nwhether that was you or\n\n360\n00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:59.500\nyour enterprise IT or what have you, they\nhave to choose what they're gonna allow.\n\n361\n00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:01.645\nRemember when we're talking\nabout the different protocols?\n\n362\n00:20:01.645 --> 00:20:06.790\nAnd I said like PPT supports EAP, MS Chat.\n\n363\n00:20:06.790 --> 00:20:10.310\nL2TP can use certificates or\npre-shared keys.\n\n364\n00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:13.430\nOn the server end of things,\nthey've decided what they want to allow.\n\n365\n00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:17.550\nEither all of that, or none of that,\nor just a particular one.\n\n366\n00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:22.110\nSo I need to make sure that my\nconnection is set up properly.\n\n367\n00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:24.270\nCuz if I, let me do this again\njust to show you that error.\n\n368\n00:20:25.540 --> 00:20:27.830\nI didn't mean to close that error so fast.\n\n369\n00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:28.840\nLet this time out again,\n\n370\n00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:32.055\nand I was expecting this failure.\n&gt;&gt; Well, I kinda forgot about it.\n\n371\n00:20:32.055 --> 00:20:33.540\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n372\n00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:35.860\n&gt;&gt; But I know what's causing the problem.\n\n373\n00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:37.600\n&gt;&gt; Well, sometimes you even have to\n\n374\n00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:43.590\nspecify a specific IP address\nto even allow that end user\n\n375\n00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:47.910\nto dial in to that authentication server.\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n376\n00:20:47.910 --> 00:20:49.120\n&gt;&gt; Okay, what does it say, Mike?\n\n377\n00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:49.940\n&gt;&gt; All right, the remote\n\n378\n00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:52.360\nconnection was denied\nbecause the user name and\n\n379\n00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:55.140\npassword combination you\nprovided is not recognized.\n\n380\n00:20:55.140 --> 00:20:57.630\nWhich could be, but\nafter I tried this two or three times,\n\n381\n00:20:57.630 --> 00:21:02.730\nI'm pretty sure I didn't type the name or\npassword incorrectly two or three times.\n\n382\n00:21:02.730 --> 00:21:08.270\nOr the selected authentication protocol is\nnot permitted on the remote access server.\n\n383\n00:21:08.270 --> 00:21:09.500\nAnd that is my issue here.\n\n384\n00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:12.370\nI added that because I've played\nwith this stuff quite a bit.\n\n385\n00:21:12.370 --> 00:21:15.120\nI'm gonna click Close, and\nI'm gonna click Advanced Options.\n\n386\n00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:17.680\nAnd Microsoft, I'm sorry,\nthis drives me crazy.\n\n387\n00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:20.060\nIf I click Advanced Options,\n\n388\n00:21:20.060 --> 00:21:25.650\nI get this screen which allows me\nto change my VPN proxy settings.\n\n389\n00:21:25.650 --> 00:21:28.750\nOkay, well, proxy is not the problem.\n\n390\n00:21:28.750 --> 00:21:32.800\nI can clear my sign-in info, so\nif I had chosen to remember me and\n\n391\n00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:36.120\nthen typed in the wrong password,\nI wanna clear that out.\n\n392\n00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:41.290\nOr I can click Edit and I get right back\nto that same screen that does not have\n\n393\n00:21:41.290 --> 00:21:43.310\na lot of information, all right?\n\n394\n00:21:43.310 --> 00:21:48.170\nSo not so advanced when it\ncomes to advanced options.\n\n395\n00:21:48.170 --> 00:21:49.330\nHere's what you're gonna need to do.\n\n396\n00:21:49.330 --> 00:21:54.170\nYou need to click on Change Adapter\nOptions, just like you were gonna go\n\n397\n00:21:54.170 --> 00:21:57.700\nconfigure the IP address of your\nnetwork adapter, all right?\n\n398\n00:21:57.700 --> 00:22:02.370\nAnd in here,\nyou'll see that it created an icon.\n\n399\n00:22:02.370 --> 00:22:04.090\nThis is your VPN profile.\n\n400\n00:22:04.090 --> 00:22:08.120\nThat other screen is the fancy Windows\n10 interface for dealing with it.\n\n401\n00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:10.960\nThis is the actual VPN profile\n\n402\n00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:15.660\nthat got created when we went through\nthe wizard and clicked Okay, all right?\n\n403\n00:22:15.660 --> 00:22:19.130\nI'm gonna right-click on this guy and\nchose Properties.\n\n404\n00:22:19.130 --> 00:22:21.970\nHere, I actually see advanced properties,\n\n405\n00:22:21.970 --> 00:22:25.320\nnot that other screen that that\nadvanced thing takes you to.\n\n406\n00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:28.320\nAnd I have several things\nthat we can work with.\n\n407\n00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:31.240\nOne, if I typed in that IP address wrong,\nright, or\n\n408\n00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:33.580\nthe name, I could type that here.\n\n409\n00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:36.400\nOn the options, remember, my credentials.\n\n410\n00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:38.510\nIdle time before hanging up.\n\n411\n00:22:38.510 --> 00:22:42.190\nSo it has some point to point protocol\nsettings that deal with multi-link.\n\n412\n00:22:42.190 --> 00:22:44.870\nWe're not gonna deal with\nthis on this particular exam.\n\n413\n00:22:46.190 --> 00:22:48.820\nSecurity, though, you'll see.\n\n414\n00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:50.780\nAnd I know that seems a little blurry.\n\n415\n00:22:50.780 --> 00:22:52.610\nType of VPN automatic.\n\n416\n00:22:52.610 --> 00:22:55.280\nRemember, we chose that\nin that first wizard.\n\n417\n00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:58.440\nIf I hit this drop-down list,\nyou'll see the same options.\n\n418\n00:22:58.440 --> 00:23:01.230\nI'm not gonna change that,\nI'm gonna leave it on automatic.\n\n419\n00:23:01.230 --> 00:23:06.080\nBut right below this, I see authentication\nand look what it said to use by default.\n\n420\n00:23:07.730 --> 00:23:10.630\nNothing.\n&gt;&gt; CHAP version two, that's okay, yeah,\n\n421\n00:23:10.630 --> 00:23:13.082\na lot of these protocols is nothing.\n&gt;&gt; Nothing is selected.\n\n422\n00:23:13.082 --> 00:23:18.010\nSo if you go through that wizard through\nthe new Windows 10 interface, you put all\n\n423\n00:23:18.010 --> 00:23:23.410\nthat information in, it doesn't select\nany authentication method here.\n\n424\n00:23:23.410 --> 00:23:24.200\nWhich is interesting.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n425\n00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:26.408\n&gt;&gt; So we need to choose something, and\n\n426\n00:23:26.408 --> 00:23:30.097\nit needs to match what the other\nend is set up to use, right?\n\n427\n00:23:30.097 --> 00:23:33.340\nSo, again, we would need to know\nthis information ahead of time.\n\n428\n00:23:33.340 --> 00:23:37.812\nI know, cuz I set up the VPN server,\nso I'm going to allow EAP MS chap.\n\n429\n00:23:37.812 --> 00:23:38.930\nThat's for IPv2.\n\n430\n00:23:38.930 --> 00:23:42.190\nI can also allow Microsoft Chap version 2.\n\n431\n00:23:42.190 --> 00:23:43.380\nWe could do path.\n\n432\n00:23:43.380 --> 00:23:44.990\nDefinitely don't wanna do that, right?\n\n433\n00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:48.155\nThat's password authentication protocol,\nit's plain text.\n\n434\n00:23:48.155 --> 00:23:51.870\nIt's doubtful your VPN server\nwould accept that anyway.\n\n435\n00:23:51.870 --> 00:23:53.617\nChap challenge handshake\nauthentication protocol.\n\n436\n00:23:53.617 --> 00:23:59.011\nAgain, it's another one that's used,\nit's very, very insecure.\n\n437\n00:23:59.011 --> 00:24:02.620\nBut occasionally you might have\nto use that with non-Windows.\n\n438\n00:24:02.620 --> 00:24:04.130\nDevices.\n\n439\n00:24:04.130 --> 00:24:06.760\nBut I'm gonna choose to allow CHAP and\nCHAP v2.\n\n440\n00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:10.735\nAnd I'll click, actually, let me see.\n\n441\n00:24:10.735 --> 00:24:14.440\nWell, let me go ahead and click OK just\nto show you that it should work now.\n\n442\n00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:17.130\nSo I go back over here, I click connect,\n\n443\n00:24:17.130 --> 00:24:22.150\nI type in lab/mike and\nmy appropriate password.\n\n444\n00:24:22.150 --> 00:24:23.899\nAnd you'll see a bunch of things\nwent by there really quick.\n\n445\n00:24:23.899 --> 00:24:27.439\nThat was actually it cycling through\nall of the different protocols and\n\n446\n00:24:27.439 --> 00:24:31.569\ndetermining which one was gonna work, and\nthen establishing the connection, and\n\n447\n00:24:31.569 --> 00:24:33.380\nnow it says connected.\n\n448\n00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:38.480\nSo if I go down back to my file Explorer,\nand I try to go to dco3, you'll see\n\n449\n00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:41.350\nI get a lot more than what I had cached.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n450\n00:24:41.350 --> 00:24:43.250\n&gt;&gt; I can see all those shares that exist\n\n451\n00:24:43.250 --> 00:24:45.910\nover there on dc3 cuz I'm now connected.\n\n452\n00:24:45.910 --> 00:24:48.850\nEven though I'm out there at the hotel,\nright, in Timbuktu or\n\n453\n00:24:48.850 --> 00:24:54.590\nwherever, I can still connect to all those\nresources on that corporate network.\n\n454\n00:24:54.590 --> 00:24:59.091\nWe take a look at PowerShell again,\nand do a little IP config.\n\n455\n00:24:59.091 --> 00:25:03.492\nThere is my IP address I got\nfrom my ISP at the hotel, but\n\n456\n00:25:03.492 --> 00:25:07.800\nnotice that I have a PPP\nadapter called work.\n\n457\n00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:11.919\nAnd I've got an IP address that's\nvalid on the corporate network, right?\n\n458\n00:25:11.919 --> 00:25:16.210\nSo this is showing you that I am\nconnected to that corporate network.\n\n459\n00:25:16.210 --> 00:25:19.300\nI would receive an IP address from\nthe corporate network that's valid on\n\n460\n00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:23.260\nthe corporate network and allowing me\nto access printers, or file shares, or\n\n461\n00:25:23.260 --> 00:25:28.190\nwhatever it is that I want\nto try to access, all right?\n\n462\n00:25:28.190 --> 00:25:29.605\nAll right, so\nwe've got that we're disconnected.\n\n463\n00:25:29.605 --> 00:25:32.845\nTo disconnect it,\nI'm just gonna click Disconnect.\n\n464\n00:25:35.470 --> 00:25:36.363\nWhat else do I wanna show you?\n\n465\n00:25:36.363 --> 00:25:41.370\nLet's go back over to, well, actually,\nlet me connect one more time.\n\n466\n00:25:41.370 --> 00:25:44.840\nI wanna show you it remembers it's\ngot my password there cached.\n\n467\n00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:48.110\nCuz I just disconnected, so\nI connected again really quick.\n\n468\n00:25:48.110 --> 00:25:51.630\nI wanna take a look at this window here.\n\n469\n00:25:52.750 --> 00:25:54.003\nAnd I wanna show you this, right?\n\n470\n00:25:54.003 --> 00:25:56.808\nSo now, you'll see it's lit up,\nit's not grade out, and\n\n471\n00:25:56.808 --> 00:25:59.523\nthat's because it's connected,\nit's established.\n\n472\n00:25:59.523 --> 00:26:01.260\nNotice the IP is disconnected, right?\n\n473\n00:26:01.260 --> 00:26:02.997\nThat's the other one we haven't used yet.\n\n474\n00:26:02.997 --> 00:26:05.765\nRight below here,\nWAN miniport, PPTP right?\n\n475\n00:26:07.095 --> 00:26:09.635\nSo it cycled through IKE, it didn't work.\n\n476\n00:26:09.635 --> 00:26:11.775\nIt tried SSTP, it didn't work.\n\n477\n00:26:11.775 --> 00:26:14.185\nIt tried L2TP, it didn't work.\n\n478\n00:26:14.185 --> 00:26:18.585\nIt tried PPTP, it worked, and\nit established that connection, right?\n\n479\n00:26:18.585 --> 00:26:23.683\nSo that's Windows 10 cycling through,\ntrying the protocols strongest to weakest\n\n480\n00:26:23.683 --> 00:26:29.260\nuntil if finds one that works, and then it\nestablishes that connection, all right?\n\n481\n00:26:29.260 --> 00:26:31.225\nThe other icon I've got over here,\n\n482\n00:26:31.225 --> 00:26:35.190\nlet's disconnect from that one,\nthis one is setup to use IKE.\n\n483\n00:26:35.190 --> 00:26:42.510\nIf we look at the profile for\nthat It's not set to automatic, right?\n\n484\n00:26:42.510 --> 00:26:46.650\nI went in here and\nhit the drop-down list and shows IKEv2.\n\n485\n00:26:46.650 --> 00:26:49.930\nIf your company is only\naccepting a single protocol,\n\n486\n00:26:49.930 --> 00:26:53.410\nthere's really no need to force Windows\nto cycle through all of them, right?\n\n487\n00:26:53.410 --> 00:26:57.976\nIf you're SSTP and you know that, set it\nto SSTP, don't leave it on automatic,\n\n488\n00:26:57.976 --> 00:27:01.422\nthat way you can establish\nthe connection that much faster.\n\n489\n00:27:01.422 --> 00:27:02.480\nOr if it's PPTP, right?\n\n490\n00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:05.850\nGo ahead and choose PPTP if you want.\n\n491\n00:27:05.850 --> 00:27:08.490\nI also set this to use\nmachine certificates,\n\n492\n00:27:08.490 --> 00:27:10.500\nagain IKEv2 user certificates.\n\n493\n00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:14.050\nI'm trying to think if there's\nanything else I wanna show you.\n\n494\n00:27:14.050 --> 00:27:16.770\nThis is that mobility option, so\n\n495\n00:27:16.770 --> 00:27:20.890\nthis what gives me the ability\nto do the VPN reconnect and\n\n496\n00:27:20.890 --> 00:27:25.940\nuse that mobi IEK, or mobIKE, that we\nare talking about earlier, all right?\n\n497\n00:27:25.940 --> 00:27:26.800\nSo we close out of that.\n\n498\n00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:27.870\nLet me zoom out.\n\n499\n00:27:27.870 --> 00:27:29.790\nI can connect from here as well.\n\n500\n00:27:29.790 --> 00:27:30.790\nBut it's kinda weird,\n\n501\n00:27:30.790 --> 00:27:34.200\ncuz if I double-click on that,\nit just takes me back over the screen.\n\n502\n00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:37.490\nAnd here, I can click Connect and\nI'm connected.\n\n503\n00:27:37.490 --> 00:27:40.740\nDidn't ask me for password because\nit's using certificates, right?\n\n504\n00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:43.520\nMy machine, my laptop,\nis issued a certificate.\n\n505\n00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:47.130\nThat's what's being authenticated\nas it establishes that connection.\n\n506\n00:27:47.130 --> 00:27:47.900\nAgain, same thing.\n\n507\n00:27:47.900 --> 00:27:50.292\nIf I go back over here, DCO3,\n\n508\n00:27:50.292 --> 00:27:55.644\nI should see all of the shares that\nare available over there on DCO3.\n\n509\n00:27:55.644 --> 00:27:58.590\nSo I've establish that VPA connection.\n\n510\n00:27:58.590 --> 00:28:04.220\nIf we go back, we'll see that this\none is using IKEv2, all right?\n\n511\n00:28:05.910 --> 00:28:09.840\nAll right, and then, let me go ahead and\ndisconnect that one.\n\n512\n00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:15.470\nWhat else do we need to cover here?\n\n513\n00:28:15.470 --> 00:28:18.090\nI know we're getting a little short\non time, so why don't we stop there.\n\n514\n00:28:18.090 --> 00:28:20.560\nI think we've seen,\nover the last couple episodes,\n\n515\n00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:23.890\nwe've talked about what a VPN is,\nwhy we use them.\n\n516\n00:28:23.890 --> 00:28:27.110\nWe've seen all of the protocols\nthat Windows 10 supports for\n\n517\n00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:28.860\ncreating the VPN connection.\n\n518\n00:28:28.860 --> 00:28:31.330\nAnd now,\nwe've seen a couple connections created\n\n519\n00:28:32.700 --> 00:28:35.300\nand established.\n&gt;&gt; Great, so we were able to see\n\n520\n00:28:35.300 --> 00:28:39.410\neverything that we talked about in that\npart one go into action here in this show.\n\n521\n00:28:39.410 --> 00:28:40.910\nBut for now, let's sign out.\n\n522\n00:28:40.910 --> 00:28:43.260\nI've been your host, Cherokee Boose.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Roderick.\n\n523\n00:28:43.260 --> 00:28:45.011\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n524\n00:28:45.011 --> 00:28:49.120\n[MUSIC]\n\n525\n00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:54.913\n&gt;&gt; Thank you

[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:05.302 --> 00:00:08.322\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.322 --> 00:00:11.750\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:14.351\n&gt;&gt; Welcome, everyone,\nto your Configure Windows Devices series.\n\n7\n00:00:14.351 --> 00:00:16.952\nStudying up for that 70-697 exam.\n\n8\n00:00:16.952 --> 00:00:18.589\nI'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n9\n00:00:18.589 --> 00:00:23.403\nIn this episode we'll be taking a look at,\nwell, configuring recovery options.\n\n10\n00:00:23.403 --> 00:00:26.174\nAnd with us today we have Mr.\nMike Rodrick.\n\n11\n00:00:26.174 --> 00:00:26.820\nHow's it going today, Mike?\n\n12\n00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.388\n&gt;&gt; It's going great, Cherokee,\nthanks for having me back.\n\n13\n00:00:28.388 --> 00:00:31.135\nExcited, as always, to be talking to\neverybody out there about Windows 10.\n\n14\n00:00:31.135 --> 00:00:35.518\nAnd, yeah, we're gonna be looking at\nour good old recovery options, right?\n\n15\n00:00:35.518 --> 00:00:39.021\nWhat happens when things start\nto go wrong, how do I get back?\n\n16\n00:00:39.021 --> 00:00:40.739\nHow do I keep my system up and running?\n\n17\n00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.769\n&gt;&gt; Well that sounds like a great thing\nto know, and especially now instead of\n\n18\n00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:48.289\nwaiting until after something\ncatastrophic happens, right?\n\n19\n00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:48.978\n&gt;&gt; That's right, yes.\n\n20\n00:00:48.978 --> 00:00:53.363\nBest to know all of your options and\nplan ahead for things like this, right?\n\n21\n00:00:53.363 --> 00:00:54.884\nAll right, plus,\nwe've gotta get ready for the exam.\n\n22\n00:00:54.884 --> 00:00:57.788\nSo we need to know what\nthese different options are,\n\n23\n00:00:57.788 --> 00:01:00.831\nwhich ones come into play at what time,\nkind of thing.\n\n24\n00:01:00.831 --> 00:01:02.372\nWhat's my best method?\n\n25\n00:01:02.372 --> 00:01:05.290\nSo we're gonna go over\na few different ones.\n\n26\n00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.369\nI don't have them in really\nany particular order,\n\n27\n00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.532\njust going according to\nthe Microsoft objectives.\n\n28\n00:01:11.532 --> 00:01:14.990\nSo we'll kinda talk about each one,\nand say when you might be using this.\n\n29\n00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.325\nOr what the consequences, right,\nof using this particular method would be.\n\n30\n00:01:18.325 --> 00:01:22.820\nAnd we're gonna start with\nconfiguring a recovery drive.\n\n31\n00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.609\nNow this is one, the idea behind a\nrecovery drive if I've got a system that I\n\n32\n00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:31.500\ncannot boot successfully,\nif I can't get into the system.\n\n33\n00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.440\nThen how do I try to fix it, right?\n\n34\n00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.020\nHow do I get into that system and\nattempt to repair it so\n\n35\n00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.180\nthat I can get back to using that laptop,\nthat desktop, whatever it is?\n\n36\n00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.890\nAnd a recovery drive is one way\nthat we can boot the system and\n\n37\n00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:46.170\nattempt to repair it.\n\n38\n00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.464\nBecause what we're gonna end up doing\nis putting all of my sys startup files,\n\n39\n00:01:50.464 --> 00:01:54.508\neverything I'm gonna to boot that\nsystem on a piece of removable media.\n\n40\n00:01:54.508 --> 00:01:59.070\nWhether that's a DVD or a thumb drive,\nor a USB based hard drive, or\n\n41\n00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.860\nsomething like that.\n\n42\n00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.950\nSome type of external, removable media,\nand we can use that to boot our system.\n\n43\n00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.980\nSo now our computer is no longer relying\non those system files that are located\n\n44\n00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:12.584\non the hard drive that might\nhave become corrupt or\n\n45\n00:02:12.584 --> 00:02:14.820\nremoved or something has happened.\n\n46\n00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:15.763\nThat's the idea.\n\n47\n00:02:15.763 --> 00:02:19.280\nAnd this is something that you\nwanna be proactive with, right?\n\n48\n00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.423\nIt's not gonna do me any good if my\nsystem won't boot and I think wow,\n\n49\n00:02:23.423 --> 00:02:25.361\nI need to make a recovery drive.\n\n50\n00:02:25.361 --> 00:02:27.295\nWell it's gonna be a little too\nlate because you can't get into\n\n51\n00:02:27.295 --> 00:02:27.960\nthe system, right?\n\n52\n00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.520\nYou need to get in here to\nmake that recovery drive.\n\n53\n00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.660\nI guess you could go to another system and\ncreate a recovery drive,\n\n54\n00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.140\nbut why not be proactive?\n\n55\n00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.281\nWhy not prepare for this kind of thing?\n\n56\n00:02:37.281 --> 00:02:39.110\nAnd it's easy, it's really easy to do.\n\n57\n00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:40.860\nThe only thing you're gonna\nneed is a thumb drive or\n\n58\n00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.200\nsome type of external media.\n\n59\n00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.355\nMicrosoft or Windows 10 has a wizard\nbuilt in that'll allow me to create this.\n\n60\n00:02:48.355 --> 00:02:51.151\nSo I'm gonna show you right now, so\nlet's take a look at my screen here.\n\n61\n00:02:51.151 --> 00:02:54.587\nI'm simply gonna go to my Start menu and\nI'm gonna type in,\n\n62\n00:02:54.587 --> 00:02:56.735\nyou could type in create a recovery.\n\n63\n00:02:56.735 --> 00:03:00.400\nOr as you can see here,\nI just started typing the word recovery.\n\n64\n00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.575\nAnd I've got a few options up here.\n\n65\n00:03:02.575 --> 00:03:06.170\nRecovery options, we'll take a look at\nit in a minute, that's something else.\n\n66\n00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.019\nCreate a recovery drive, however,\nthat's the one I want, right?\n\n67\n00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:15.158\nSo we're gonna select that and\nclick Yes to the good old UAC, all right?\n\n68\n00:03:15.158 --> 00:03:20.275\nNow this is one, there really isn't\na way to get to it through the settings.\n\n69\n00:03:20.275 --> 00:03:23.440\nYou do need to just search for\nit on your Start menu there.\n\n70\n00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.820\nI believe anyway, and\nso here is the wizard.\n\n71\n00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:29.831\nCreate a recovery drive.\n\n72\n00:03:29.831 --> 00:03:33.971\nEven if your PC can't start you can\nuse a recovery drive to reset it or\n\n73\n00:03:33.971 --> 00:03:36.320\ntroubleshoot problems, all right?\n\n74\n00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:37.873\nSo this is the wizard.\n\n75\n00:03:37.873 --> 00:03:40.890\nAnd below that,\nlet me gonna zoom back in here.\n\n76\n00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:44.201\nI've got a checkmark here, back up\nsystem files to the recovery drive.\n\n77\n00:03:44.201 --> 00:03:46.340\nAnd this, again,\nthis is the important part.\n\n78\n00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:51.201\nThis is what we want to be able to get\nin here, and start this machine, and\n\n79\n00:03:51.201 --> 00:03:52.497\ntroubleshoot it.\n\n80\n00:03:52.497 --> 00:03:54.340\nSo I'm simply gonna click Next.\n\n81\n00:03:56.903 --> 00:03:59.260\nAnd then we're gonna wait and\nwhat it's gonna to do is it's gonna look.\n\n82\n00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.312\nI need to have my, I should have told you,\n\n83\n00:04:01.312 --> 00:04:03.847\nI need my removable media\nplugged in at this point.\n\n84\n00:04:03.847 --> 00:04:06.535\nSo I already had my thumb\ndrive in the machine.\n\n85\n00:04:06.535 --> 00:04:10.485\nAnd now it's scanning to see what drives\nor removable media I have available.\n\n86\n00:04:10.485 --> 00:04:14.537\nAnd it should present me with\na list that I can choose from.\n\n87\n00:04:14.537 --> 00:04:17.836\n&gt;&gt; Okay, Mike, so if I would have\nnot had that checkbox checked,\n\n88\n00:04:17.836 --> 00:04:20.779\nam I just gonna be backing up\nany kind of personal files?\n\n89\n00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:23.253\nOr what is involved with that?\n\n90\n00:04:23.253 --> 00:04:26.113\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I'm not exactly sure,\nto be honest with you.\n\n91\n00:04:26.113 --> 00:04:27.880\nIt's not gonna back up\nyour personal files.\n\n92\n00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.465\nIt will give you the ability\nto start the system up.\n\n93\n00:04:31.465 --> 00:04:35.204\nIt's basically creating kind\nof a WinPE type environment,\n\n94\n00:04:35.204 --> 00:04:37.780\nor I should say a WinRE type environment.\n\n95\n00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:40.312\n&gt;&gt; Okay, to just at least,\nif my system's not even booting,\n\n96\n00:04:40.312 --> 00:04:43.669\ngive it a little bit of a kickstart there\nto let me access some of those options.\n\n97\n00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:45.080\n&gt;&gt; Yep, exactly.\nSo we'll wait and\n\n98\n00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.280\nwe'll let this thing whir and\ngrind for just a second.\n\n99\n00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.597\nI just wanted to show you this\nnext step where we pick the drive.\n\n100\n00:04:50.597 --> 00:04:55.520\nI'm not gonna actually finish the process\nbecause it takes a little while.\n\n101\n00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:59.939\nEven on USB 3 this can take\nseveral minutes or longer,\n\n102\n00:04:59.939 --> 00:05:02.256\n30 minutes [LAUGH] or more.\n\n103\n00:05:02.256 --> 00:05:05.656\n[LAUGH] If you were with us the other\nday when we were doing some recording,\n\n104\n00:05:05.656 --> 00:05:07.120\nwe found that out the hard way.\n\n105\n00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.564\nSo I'll show you the process.\n\n106\n00:05:09.564 --> 00:05:13.565\nWe'll get it started and then I've got\nanother drive that's already finished.\n\n107\n00:05:13.565 --> 00:05:17.520\nAnd I'll show you how to use that\nrecovery drive once it gets created.\n\n108\n00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:21.080\nSo again, slowly but\nsurely scanning my system.\n\n109\n00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:25.226\nIt's odd that this takes so long to-\n&gt;&gt; And I was gonna ask, Mike,\n\n110\n00:05:25.226 --> 00:05:29.442\nwhen it comes to selecting a drive, is\nthere anything that we should be aware of,\n\n111\n00:05:29.442 --> 00:05:30.259\nsize or speed?\n\n112\n00:05:30.259 --> 00:05:31.870\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, size is the main thing, right?\n\n113\n00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:34.925\nJust to make sure that we've got\nenough room on that thumb drive.\n\n114\n00:05:34.925 --> 00:05:38.010\nI've seen a couple of\ndifferent requirements.\n\n115\n00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:40.705\nI know, I think there's wizard,\nin fact, yeah, we just finished so\n\n116\n00:05:40.705 --> 00:05:42.135\nlet's take a look at my screen here.\n\n117\n00:05:42.135 --> 00:05:43.830\nYou can see it says 8 GB.\n\n118\n00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:46.478\nThe drive must be able to\nhold at least 8 GB and\n\n119\n00:05:46.478 --> 00:05:48.929\neverything on the drive will be deleted.\n\n120\n00:05:48.929 --> 00:05:53.140\nI've see in docs.microsoft.com\nwhere they've quoted it at 16 GB.\n\n121\n00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:54.888\nI would say the more the merrier, right?\n\n122\n00:05:54.888 --> 00:05:57.770\nThe more space you've got,\nprobably the better.\n\n123\n00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:59.476\nSpeed wise, the faster the better.\n\n124\n00:05:59.476 --> 00:06:02.953\nAgain, you could still do it with USB 2.0.\n\n125\n00:06:02.953 --> 00:06:07.787\n3.0 is just gonna make this initial\ncopy process a little bit faster.\n\n126\n00:06:07.787 --> 00:06:09.345\n&gt;&gt; I'll take some coffee, too.\n\n127\n00:06:09.345 --> 00:06:10.044\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, me too.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n128\n00:06:10.044 --> 00:06:12.274\n&gt;&gt; But if you only have USB 2.0,\n\n129\n00:06:12.274 --> 00:06:14.580\nthen by all means use that.\n\n130\n00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:18.720\nAnd again, I think you had asked me\nearlier if it backs up system files,\n\n131\n00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:19.893\njust to reiterate.\n\n132\n00:06:19.893 --> 00:06:23.779\nBasically what's gonna happen is it's\ngonna copy all the recovery utilities to\n\n133\n00:06:23.779 --> 00:06:24.993\nthis removable media.\n\n134\n00:06:24.993 --> 00:06:26.783\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n&gt;&gt; So all of those things that I can get\n\n135\n00:06:26.783 --> 00:06:29.303\nto from my advanced boot\noptions in Windows 10,\n\n136\n00:06:29.303 --> 00:06:31.970\nIt moves those utilities\nto the thumb drive.\n\n137\n00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:36.712\nAnd if I check that checkmark, like we\ndid, it also copies all of my system\n\n138\n00:06:36.712 --> 00:06:40.934\nfiles so that it can attempt to\nrepair my installation if need be.\n\n139\n00:06:40.934 --> 00:06:45.160\nBut it doesn't do anything like capture my\ndocuments, my pictures, nothing like that.\n\n140\n00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:45.808\n&gt;&gt; No personal.\n\n141\n00:06:45.808 --> 00:06:48.266\n&gt;&gt; It's simply trying to get the,\nbecause at this point,\n\n142\n00:06:48.266 --> 00:06:49.850\nwhat we're trying to fix is the OS.\n\n143\n00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:51.314\nWe're thinking everything is fine.\n\n144\n00:06:51.314 --> 00:06:55.420\nIt's just maybe startup files have\nbecome corrupt, and something like that.\n\n145\n00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:58.863\nSomething I can fix in my boot\nconfiguration database, maybe,\n\n146\n00:06:58.863 --> 00:07:00.981\njust to get that system running again.\n\n147\n00:07:00.981 --> 00:07:02.960\nAll right, so here is my list.\n\n148\n00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:04.017\nI can see I've got several drives.\n\n149\n00:07:04.017 --> 00:07:07.060\nIt's very important to\nunderstand which drive is which.\n\n150\n00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:10.433\nBecause as the wizard states,\nit will format the drive,\n\n151\n00:07:10.433 --> 00:07:14.241\nwhich means that anything that's\ncurrently on it will be lost.\n\n152\n00:07:14.241 --> 00:07:16.560\nSo just keep that in mind.\n\n153\n00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:19.980\nE is actually a fixed disk\ninside my virtual machine.\n\n154\n00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:24.800\nG is the recovery drive I already have\nplugged in from the completed process.\n\n155\n00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:26.449\nF is my blank thumb drive.\n\n156\n00:07:26.449 --> 00:07:30.400\nSo I'm gonna select that drive and\nI'm gonna click Next.\n\n157\n00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:32.336\nAnd it gives me one more\nchance to back out.\n\n158\n00:07:32.336 --> 00:07:34.600\nHey, everything on that\ndrive will be deleted.\n\n159\n00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:38.284\nIf you have anything on there that you\nneed to save, make sure you back it up.\n\n160\n00:07:38.284 --> 00:07:42.660\nAnd then we click Create and\nit begins the process, all right?\n\n161\n00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:45.658\nAnd again,\nthis could take depending on your system,\n\n162\n00:07:45.658 --> 00:07:48.273\nanywhere from ten minutes\nto probably an hour.\n\n163\n00:07:48.273 --> 00:07:52.424\nIt's just kinda hard to say but\nit can take a little while,\n\n164\n00:07:52.424 --> 00:07:54.212\nso be patient with this.\n\n165\n00:07:54.212 --> 00:07:55.982\nI'm simply gonna cancel that out,\n\n166\n00:07:55.982 --> 00:07:58.886\nwhich will probably take just\nas long as the copy process.\n\n167\n00:07:58.886 --> 00:08:00.557\nNo, I'm kidding, it shouldn't.\n\n168\n00:08:00.557 --> 00:08:05.175\nAnd once this cancels out, we'll Take\na look at the drive that was created\n\n169\n00:08:05.175 --> 00:08:09.660\nalready and then we'll reboot to it and\nsee what we get.\n\n170\n00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:11.330\nAlright beautiful so there we go.\n\n171\n00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:15.790\nSo I open up file explorer and\nI take a look at that g drive.\n\n172\n00:08:15.790 --> 00:08:18.310\nE is, f is the one that we just told it\n\n173\n00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:21.540\nbefore I cancelled it it actually\nstarted the formatting process.\n\n174\n00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:25.100\nBut g is the completed one so\nyou can see they formatted the drive,\n\n175\n00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:26.190\ncreated a couple folders.\n\n176\n00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:30.040\nEFI with my boot information and\nthen my sources file,\n\n177\n00:08:31.730 --> 00:08:35.330\nwhatever again,\nwhatever it needs to run those utilities.\n\n178\n00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:37.240\nThat helped me repair my system.\n\n179\n00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:42.310\nSo once you've got that disk created or\nthat recovery drive created\n\n180\n00:08:42.310 --> 00:08:46.740\nall we have to do now is reboot the system\nso that's what we are going to do.\n\n181\n00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:49.030\nI'm going to restart.\n\n182\n00:08:50.850 --> 00:08:55.190\nAnd on this machine I'm just gonna hit\nmy F12 to get my one time boot menu\n\n183\n00:08:55.190 --> 00:08:57.070\nto boot to that USB.\n\n184\n00:08:58.660 --> 00:09:03.325\nI'm gonna unplug one of them so\nI don't have too many choices in there.\n\n185\n00:09:03.325 --> 00:09:04.420\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I don't want the one that's\n\n186\n00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:06.180\nhalf finished.\n\n187\n00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:09.170\nSo waiting for it to restart here.\n\n188\n00:09:09.170 --> 00:09:11.020\nAnd I'm gonna hit F12 to\nget my one time boot menu.\n\n189\n00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:12.870\n&gt;&gt; But that brings up a good point, Mike.\n\n190\n00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:18.020\nBecause there might even be some kind\nof transient boot issue that's not\n\n191\n00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:23.700\nactually inside of the OS if there's\nsome unnecessary external drive.\n\n192\n00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:25.600\nAlways try to unplug those first and\n\n193\n00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:28.418\nreboot to make sure that it's not\njust looking to boot from that first.\n\n194\n00:09:28.418 --> 00:09:32.370\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, absolutely because it\nmight try to pick the wrong guy for you.\n\n195\n00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:35.210\nSo there we go.\nI'm gonna go down to my USB device and\n\n196\n00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:36.910\nselect that.\n\n197\n00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:38.520\nWhich should begin the boot process.\n\n198\n00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:41.690\nAnd we shall see,\nthere's my good old Windows logo.\n\n199\n00:09:41.690 --> 00:09:45.280\nBut again, what it's doing now is\nit's booting from that thumb drive.\n\n200\n00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:49.670\nIt's not using the system\nfiles on the hard drive.\n\n201\n00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:50.600\nIf those were corrupt and\n\n202\n00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:55.250\nI was unable to start, this is going to\nallow me to get back into the system.\n\n203\n00:09:55.250 --> 00:09:55.990\nSo we'll let this boot up,\n\n204\n00:09:55.990 --> 00:09:59.620\nit shouldn't take too terribly long and\nwe'll see what we get.\n\n205\n00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:04.680\nBut really it's gonna look, if you've\never gone into your Windows 10 machine.\n\n206\n00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:09.160\nAnd gone into your recovery options from\nyour settings and chosen the advanced boot\n\n207\n00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:12.660\noptions or advanced startup options and\nclicked restart.\n\n208\n00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:15.390\nThen you get that screen,\nthat blue screen with the tiles.\n\n209\n00:10:15.390 --> 00:10:18.460\nThat gives you your troubleshooter,\nand your command prompt, and\n\n210\n00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:19.820\nexit to return to Windows.\n\n211\n00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:21.990\nThat's what it's gonna be,\nit's gonna look just like that.\n\n212\n00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:23.030\nIt is that.\n\n213\n00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:23.940\nIt is the same thing.\n\n214\n00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:26.455\nIt's just now we've moved\nthat to the thumb drive.\n\n215\n00:10:26.455 --> 00:10:28.070\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so that's all it is.\n\n216\n00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:30.290\nIt's gonna look exactly the same.\n\n217\n00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:31.620\nNo difference there.\n\n218\n00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:33.990\nBut it's cool to know that we can do this.\n\n219\n00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:38.720\nIf that hard drive did have a problem,\nIf my operating system did have a problem,\n\n220\n00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:41.170\nthis would allow me to at least\nget in there, trouble shoot it and\n\n221\n00:10:41.170 --> 00:10:42.180\nsee what I can do.\n\n222\n00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:45.720\n&gt;&gt; So this would probably be a good tool,\njust to keep in my tool kit.\n\n223\n00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:49.210\nSomething like a physical toolkit\nif I were working on systems often.\n\n224\n00:10:49.210 --> 00:10:50.440\n&gt;&gt; Yes, absolutely.\n\n225\n00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:52.170\nAbsolutely.\n\n226\n00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:57.100\nI would have to check because I'm copying\nthe system files from this system/\n\n227\n00:10:57.100 --> 00:11:01.890\nSome of the documentation I'm reading on\nMicrosoft said it is tied to the system.\n\n228\n00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:05.330\nSo if you take it to another system\nyou might not have the same luck\n\n229\n00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:06.660\nBooting that system.\n\n230\n00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:08.310\nSomething definitely worth trying.\n\n231\n00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:11.030\nBut it is something that you\nshould think about ahead of time.\n\n232\n00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:13.670\nYou get a Windows 10 system,\nif you're responsible for managing and\n\n233\n00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:14.980\nmaintaining those Windows 10 systems.\n\n234\n00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:17.380\nOr if this is your own personal machine,\n\n235\n00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:20.060\nthis is something you should do early on,\nright.\n\n236\n00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:22.410\nGo ahead and create it and\nthrow it in a drawer somewhere.\n\n237\n00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:25.560\nJust label it and\nthrow it in a drawer, keep it safe.\n\n238\n00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:29.100\nHopefully you, probably you'll never need\nit, but it's good to know you have it\n\n239\n00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:32.160\nbecause you can't go back and\n[LAUGH] create it if your system is down.\n\n240\n00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:33.660\nThat is the problem.\n\n241\n00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:35.090\nAll right, so\nI'll choose my keyboard layout.\n\n242\n00:11:35.090 --> 00:11:37.120\nI'm gonna stick with US.\n\n243\n00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:38.900\nAnd then, here's my options.\n\n244\n00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:43.010\nI can continue, Exit and\nContinue to Windows 10, so that's saying\n\n245\n00:11:43.010 --> 00:11:46.800\nI didn't mean to boot to the USB let me\njust go back into my Windows installation.\n\n246\n00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:49.640\nI can use a device, use a USB drive,\nnetwork connection, or\n\n247\n00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:50.540\nWindows recovery DVD.\n\n248\n00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:52.560\nWell, that's what we're doing already,\nright?\n\n249\n00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:54.980\nWe booted to the thumb drive.\n\n250\n00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:58.360\nSo if I click this,\nall it's actually gonna do is reboot and\n\n251\n00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:00.210\nI'll have to choose USB thumb drive.\n\n252\n00:12:00.210 --> 00:12:01.080\nThat's what I'm saying.\n\n253\n00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:04.020\nThis is the same screen you\nsee from within Windows.\n\n254\n00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:06.510\nAnd it's giving me the option\nto boot to itself,\n\n255\n00:12:06.510 --> 00:12:09.890\nkinda crazy, but that's what it is,\nso don't use that one.\n\n256\n00:12:09.890 --> 00:12:12.090\nAnd then Troubleshoot, Reset your PC, or\n\n257\n00:12:12.090 --> 00:12:15.790\nsee Advanced Options, or\nPower off the Machine.\n\n258\n00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:16.990\nSo we go ahead and click Troubleshoot.\n\n259\n00:12:18.690 --> 00:12:21.020\nBut let me back up one second.\n\n260\n00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:23.890\nAfter you make that drive, the first\ntime you make your recovery drive\n\n261\n00:12:23.890 --> 00:12:26.190\nbefore you throw it in the drawer and\nforget about it.\n\n262\n00:12:26.190 --> 00:12:27.210\nThis would be a good thing to do.\n\n263\n00:12:27.210 --> 00:12:31.410\nGo ahead and boot your system to it and\nsee that you can get to the screen.\n\n264\n00:12:31.410 --> 00:12:34.290\nMaybe even launching troubleshooting or\nat least click continue and\n\n265\n00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:37.530\nexit and then eject your thumb drive and\nyou know, hey, it's good,\n\n266\n00:12:37.530 --> 00:12:39.050\nI can put in a drawer and\nnot have to worry about it.\n\n267\n00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:42.200\nYou don't want to throw it in the drawer\nnever having [LAUGH] tested it and\n\n268\n00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:45.990\npull it when you need it and and\nrealize that you did something wrong.\n\n269\n00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:47.190\nSo, test it out first.\n\n270\n00:12:47.190 --> 00:12:49.790\n&gt;&gt; I legitimately have\nmine in a drawer but\n\n271\n00:12:49.790 --> 00:12:53.405\nit's wrapped inside of a piece of\npaper like with the label on it.\n\n272\n00:12:53.405 --> 00:12:54.870\n&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.\n&gt;&gt; And I just taped the paper to make it\n\n273\n00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:56.770\na little bit bigger because I have\n\n274\n00:12:56.770 --> 00:12:58.985\na propensity of actually\nlosing a lot of things.\n\n275\n00:12:58.985 --> 00:13:00.620\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you do those little thumb drives,\n\n276\n00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:01.530\nright, so that's a good idea.\n\n277\n00:13:01.530 --> 00:13:06.050\nAll right, I'm going to click troubleshoot\nthis time and here I can say Recover from\n\n278\n00:13:06.050 --> 00:13:10.510\na drive, and this would end up removing.\n\n279\n00:13:10.510 --> 00:13:13.780\nLet me zoom in, so I don't know if I can\nzoom, nope, not in this environment.\n\n280\n00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:15.010\nMy zoom isn't gonna work.\n\n281\n00:13:15.010 --> 00:13:19.020\nBut reinstalls Windows from the recovery\ndrive connected to this PC.\n\n282\n00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:22.610\nThis will remove all of your files and\napps, so\n\n283\n00:13:22.610 --> 00:13:27.930\nworse case scenario we can choose that and\nwe can try to recover our machine.\n\n284\n00:13:27.930 --> 00:13:30.790\nOr I can click Advanced options and\nthis again what you would\n\n285\n00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:33.700\nsee if you picked those advanced\nstartup options from within Windows 10.\n\n286\n00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:35.840\nI've got System Restore, so\n\n287\n00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:38.640\nif I have restore points,\nI could choose this option.\n\n288\n00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:41.200\nWe'll take a look at restore\npoints in just a little bit.\n\n289\n00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:45.150\nI choose this option, it will browse\nmy hard drive, find my restore points.\n\n290\n00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:49.300\nAssuming they're available, right and\naccessible, the hard drive hasn't failed.\n\n291\n00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:54.400\nAnd give me the option to try to roll\nback to a previous restore point.\n\n292\n00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:58.220\nSystem image recovery,\nI have created a system image.\n\n293\n00:13:58.220 --> 00:14:00.000\nI could use that option.\n\n294\n00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.310\nStartup repair.\n\n295\n00:14:01.310 --> 00:14:04.990\nThat's going to check my b-c-e,\nmake sure everything is good there.\n\n296\n00:14:04.990 --> 00:14:08.110\nI've got my command prompt,\nwhich is just that, my command prompt.\n\n297\n00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:10.220\nI can load certain utilities there.\n\n298\n00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:11.810\nTry to troubleshoot my machine.\n\n299\n00:14:11.810 --> 00:14:14.440\nUFI firmware settings, so\nif I needed to change.\n\n300\n00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:18.100\nMaybe something got out of order and\nI need to remove it from the boot order,\n\n301\n00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:20.560\nso that my machine can boot successfully.\n\n302\n00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:22.940\nOr go back to the previous version.\n\n303\n00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:25.400\nIf you have upgraded your Windows 10,\n\n304\n00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:30.090\nyou can roll back to a previous version,\nall right.\n\n305\n00:14:30.090 --> 00:14:34.220\nAny of which could again fix your problem,\ndepending on what it is.\n\n306\n00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:35.420\nSo that is system recovery.\n\n307\n00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:37.060\nKeep in mind this is not an image.\n\n308\n00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:42.360\nI would have to create the image if\nI want to do system image recovery.\n\n309\n00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:45.470\nAnd back here, recover from a drive.\n\n310\n00:14:45.470 --> 00:14:46.740\nThere's no image on this drive.\n\n311\n00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:51.050\nRight it copied over the startup files and\nall the repair utilities, so\n\n312\n00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:52.700\nthat I can get to this point.\n\n313\n00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:56.520\nBut I would also need a recovery image\neither stored on that same thumb drive.\n\n314\n00:14:56.520 --> 00:15:02.140\nOr on some other removal media that I can\nplugin, because once I click this, right,\n\n315\n00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:07.330\nit is going to, well actually I\ndon't want to do that just yet.\n\n316\n00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:11.800\nWe'll talk a little bit about this when\nwe get into our next episode when we\n\n317\n00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:13.540\nlook at these options resetting.\n\n318\n00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:15.339\nAnd refreshing our PC.\n\n319\n00:15:15.339 --> 00:15:17.670\nTalking about whether or\nnot, there's no back button.\n\n320\n00:15:17.670 --> 00:15:18.250\n&gt;&gt; Nope.\n\n321\n00:15:18.250 --> 00:15:18.992\n&gt;&gt; I just realized that\nonce I clicked that.\n\n322\n00:15:18.992 --> 00:15:21.081\n&gt;&gt; I've learned that the hard way too,\nyeah.\n\n323\n00:15:21.081 --> 00:15:22.950\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm kinda stuck there, aren't I?\n\n324\n00:15:22.950 --> 00:15:24.158\nAll right-\n&gt;&gt; Reboot.\n\n325\n00:15:24.158 --> 00:15:26.375\n&gt;&gt; Well we're not actually\ngoing to clean this machine.\n\n326\n00:15:26.375 --> 00:15:31.158\nSo we are going to power down, yeah.\n\n327\n00:15:31.158 --> 00:15:34.790\nLet's just restart that guest.\n\n328\n00:15:36.190 --> 00:15:39.090\nAll right, so that is our recovery drive.\n\n329\n00:15:39.090 --> 00:15:42.860\nWhile that's rebooting, I'm actually\ngonna yank that drive out of there so\n\n330\n00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:43.560\nit doesn't try to boot.\n\n331\n00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:46.010\nWe're gonna switch over to another client.\n\n332\n00:15:46.010 --> 00:15:50.000\nAnd we're gonna talk now about\nrestore points, all right?\n\n333\n00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.870\nOr what they call system restore.\n\n334\n00:15:51.870 --> 00:15:54.279\nAnd restore points have been around for\nquite some time.\n\n335\n00:15:54.279 --> 00:15:57.923\nI don't remember which operating\nsystem they actually came out in, but\n\n336\n00:15:57.923 --> 00:16:00.685\nit's been around for\nawhile and they're very handy.\n\n337\n00:16:00.685 --> 00:16:05.458\nThey are basically points in\ntime that you're gonna mark that\n\n338\n00:16:05.458 --> 00:16:08.040\nyou can roll back to, all right.\n\n339\n00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:11.840\nThis can be great if you've got\nan application that you've just installed\n\n340\n00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:16.540\nthat's casing a problem, or a driver that\nyou've installed that's causing a problem,\n\n341\n00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:19.570\nrestore points can help\nyou recover from that.\n\n342\n00:16:19.570 --> 00:16:21.920\nAnd we'll talk about how\nwe can turn this on,\n\n343\n00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:25.050\nI'll show you the different options and\nwe'll actually use of restore point.\n\n344\n00:16:25.050 --> 00:16:27.850\nA couple things we wanna\nkeep in mind though.\n\n345\n00:16:27.850 --> 00:16:31.910\nIt's leveraging the VSS,\nthe volume shadows copy service.\n\n346\n00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:36.040\nIt requires NTFS on that partition.\n\n347\n00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:39.360\nYou can create these\nrestore points manually.\n\n348\n00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:40.660\nI'll show you how to do that.\n\n349\n00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:42.980\nThere's also some that\nare created automatically.\n\n350\n00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:44.360\nWhen you do Windows updates,\n\n351\n00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:48.590\na restore point is automatically created\nbefore that update is installed.\n\n352\n00:16:48.590 --> 00:16:50.790\nWhen you do software installation,\n\n353\n00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:54.745\na restore point gets created before\nthat installation process occurs.\n\n354\n00:16:54.745 --> 00:16:57.055\nAnd when you roll back to a restore point,\n\n355\n00:16:57.055 --> 00:17:00.425\na previous restore point,\na new restore point is created and\n\n356\n00:17:00.425 --> 00:17:04.995\ncreates that roll back fails and\nI need to get back to where I was.\n\n357\n00:17:04.995 --> 00:17:07.245\nIt'll create a restore point there.\n\n358\n00:17:07.245 --> 00:17:10.715\nI will say don't rely on them,\nlike that software installation one,\n\n359\n00:17:10.715 --> 00:17:14.660\nit's supposed to create a restore point\nany time you do software installation.\n\n360\n00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:16.800\nI've seen several times where it doesn't.\n\n361\n00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:21.830\nSo if you are using this as a method\nto recover your system, you probably\n\n362\n00:17:21.830 --> 00:17:25.320\nwant to manually create restore points\nwhen you know you're gonna need them.\n\n363\n00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:28.480\nLike if I'm getting ready to make some\nmajor change, I'm not gonna rely on\n\n364\n00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:32.115\nWindows to automatically create it, I'm\ngonna go ahead and create one manually.\n\n365\n00:17:32.115 --> 00:17:33.670\nIt's still might create one automatically,\n\n366\n00:17:33.670 --> 00:17:37.910\nbut I'd rather have two restore\npoints than no restore points, right.\n\n367\n00:17:37.910 --> 00:17:40.600\nSo create one manually if you\nfeel you are going to need them.\n\n368\n00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:43.670\nThere's also scheduled\ntasks that you can enable.\n\n369\n00:17:43.670 --> 00:17:47.420\nAnd we can also use PowerShell\nto create these restore points.\n\n370\n00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:49.250\nI'll show you some of\nthose commands as well.\n\n371\n00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:52.600\n&gt;&gt; So Mike,\nI know we've talked about this before.\n\n372\n00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:57.060\nHow do you feel about using restore\npoints for malware attacks?\n\n373\n00:17:57.060 --> 00:17:58.657\nWhat do you think about that?\n\n374\n00:17:58.657 --> 00:17:59.438\n&gt;&gt; It's questionable, right.\n\n375\n00:17:59.438 --> 00:18:03.240\nWe have to understand what\nrestore points are doing.\n\n376\n00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:05.920\nRestore points don't mess\nwith any of your files.\n\n377\n00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:09.370\nThis is an important thing to know for\nthe exam, and for the real world.\n\n378\n00:18:09.370 --> 00:18:14.480\nRestore points, they don't roll\nback like your personal files,\n\n379\n00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:17.740\nyour documents, your pictures,\nyour emails, anything like that.\n\n380\n00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:19.720\nNone of that gets changed.\n\n381\n00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:23.750\nWhen you do a restore point, what you're\ndoing is you're rolling back the registry,\n\n382\n00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:26.870\nand system configuration settings.\n\n383\n00:18:26.870 --> 00:18:30.490\nSo, if you got some\nmalware on your system and\n\n384\n00:18:30.490 --> 00:18:34.830\nit made some registry entry, some hook so\nthat every time you launch the browser or\n\n385\n00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:38.060\nwent to some page,\nyou got the FBI warning.\n\n386\n00:18:38.060 --> 00:18:39.720\nSomething crazy like that.\n\n387\n00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:41.200\nIt could fix that, right.\n\n388\n00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:44.040\nCuz you're gonna roll back to before\nthe registry entry was created.\n\n389\n00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:47.940\nBut what you didn't do is\nremove any infected files.\n\n390\n00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:51.910\nMaybe you did, maybe you know what\nwas infected, you removed that, and\n\n391\n00:18:51.910 --> 00:18:54.840\nthen you did a restore point and\nyou might be good to go.\n\n392\n00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:56.840\nBut it is something to keep in mind.\n\n393\n00:18:56.840 --> 00:18:58.570\nIt's not rolling back your files.\n\n394\n00:18:58.570 --> 00:19:02.160\nSo if you downloaded something that\nwas infected, caused a problem,\n\n395\n00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:04.740\nrolled your system back,\nthat file is still infected.\n\n396\n00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:07.590\nAnd as soon as you open it again,\nyou're gonna re-infect your system.\n\n397\n00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:09.950\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\njust thinking about what you just told us,\n\n398\n00:19:09.950 --> 00:19:12.700\nhow would that potentially\naffect the applications?\n\n399\n00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:14.730\n&gt;&gt; Applications, it's gonna break.\n\n400\n00:19:14.730 --> 00:19:17.060\nRight, because when you\ninstall an application,\n\n401\n00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:19.220\nregistry entries are created for\nthat application.\n\n402\n00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:22.130\nSo when you double-click on the icon,\nWindows knows what to do.\n\n403\n00:19:22.130 --> 00:19:27.410\nWhat executable to run, what DLO, all of\nthat stuff is stored in the registry.\n\n404\n00:19:27.410 --> 00:19:32.850\nSo when I roll back, it is going to\nbreak anything that I have installed\n\n405\n00:19:32.850 --> 00:19:35.560\nafter that restore point was created,\nwhich I'll show you.\n\n406\n00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:37.580\nI'll show you an example of that.\n\n407\n00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:39.900\nAll right, so\nlet's take a look at me screen here.\n\n408\n00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:41.610\nLet's set up some restore points,\n\n409\n00:19:41.610 --> 00:19:43.940\nconfigure system restore\nin the first place.\n\n410\n00:19:43.940 --> 00:19:46.357\nWe'll create some system restore points,\nand we'll do some rollbacks, and\n\n411\n00:19:46.357 --> 00:19:47.130\nwe'll see how it works.\n\n412\n00:19:47.130 --> 00:19:49.353\nAll right, to set up system restore,\n\n413\n00:19:49.353 --> 00:19:54.360\nit's actually done in our advanced\nsystem properties or advanced settings.\n\n414\n00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:56.418\nThere's several ways you could get here.\n\n415\n00:19:56.418 --> 00:19:58.780\nI'm gonna right-click on this PC and\n\n416\n00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:03.530\nchoose Properties, which as you can\nsee brings me to my system settings.\n\n417\n00:20:03.530 --> 00:20:07.084\nSo I could have gone Control Panel,\nSystem and Security, System, and\n\n418\n00:20:07.084 --> 00:20:08.455\ngotten to the same screen.\n\n419\n00:20:08.455 --> 00:20:10.540\nSeveral different ways I can get here.\n\n420\n00:20:10.540 --> 00:20:16.740\nAnd over here on the left-hand side of\nmy nav tree I have my System Protection.\n\n421\n00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:20.450\nClick on that, and\nthat's gonna launch my System Properties.\n\n422\n00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:26.320\nAnd from here, this is where I\ncan enable my system restore,\n\n423\n00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:28.331\nright, and I'll zoom in.\n\n424\n00:20:28.331 --> 00:20:33.420\nUse system protection to undo unwanted\nsystem changes, that's key, right?\n\n425\n00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:37.620\nSystem changes, not your files,\nthat's not protecting anything like that.\n\n426\n00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:42.390\nDown below, I can see my drive and\nit's currently turned off, so\n\n427\n00:20:42.390 --> 00:20:45.330\nit is not on by default.\n\n428\n00:20:45.330 --> 00:20:48.850\nIf I had multiple drives in this machine,\nthey would all be listed here,\n\n429\n00:20:48.850 --> 00:20:52.280\nvolumes I should say,\nit's not really looking at physical disk,\n\n430\n00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:55.830\njust looking at volumes, C:,\nD:, E:, that kind of thing.\n\n431\n00:20:55.830 --> 00:21:00.324\nAnd you can turn this protection on for\neach volume individually.\n\n432\n00:21:00.324 --> 00:21:02.290\nWell, here's the thing\nyou want to think about.\n\n433\n00:21:02.290 --> 00:21:05.450\nThis is only protecting your system files.\n\n434\n00:21:05.450 --> 00:21:08.170\nRight, think about your E drive.\n\n435\n00:21:08.170 --> 00:21:09.890\nWhere's Windows installed?\n\n436\n00:21:09.890 --> 00:21:13.215\nDo you have any system files on your\nE drive, or anything like that?\n\n437\n00:21:13.215 --> 00:21:14.990\n99.9% of the time no.\n\n438\n00:21:14.990 --> 00:21:18.325\nUnless you've done some really\ncool customizations and\n\n439\n00:21:18.325 --> 00:21:23.150\nmoved some of your system filters to\nanother volume, everything resides on SQL.\n\n440\n00:21:23.150 --> 00:21:27.254\nSo you could turn it on on D: or E:, but\nyou're really not protecting anything\n\n441\n00:21:27.254 --> 00:21:30.700\nbecause they're not any system\nfiles in those drives, alright?\n\n442\n00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:34.019\nUnless you have some special circumstance\nwhere you have moves some of that.\n\n443\n00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:38.030\nSo, do you turn it on, on other volumes?\n\n444\n00:21:38.030 --> 00:21:38.970\nProbably not.\n\n445\n00:21:38.970 --> 00:21:40.660\nWould it hurt anything to do it?\n\n446\n00:21:40.660 --> 00:21:42.720\nNot really because there's\nnothing there anyway, so\n\n447\n00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:45.260\nit's not gonna take up a lot of space or\nanything like that.\n\n448\n00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:48.294\n&gt;&gt; I think where I've used\nit on like file volumes,\n\n449\n00:21:48.294 --> 00:21:52.004\nMike was when you're looking\nat those previous versions.\n\n450\n00:21:52.004 --> 00:21:57.640\nSo it uses that same underpinning\ntechnology for the shadow copy service.\n\n451\n00:21:57.640 --> 00:22:01.126\nSo if you did have a drive that you\nuse specifically for files, then\n\n452\n00:22:01.126 --> 00:22:05.296\nyou would have to enable it for that drive\nto have these previous versions tab for\n\n453\n00:22:05.296 --> 00:22:07.429\nparticular file or folder, your file.\n\n454\n00:22:07.429 --> 00:22:11.004\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, and we're giving that when\nwe talk about some different protection\n\n455\n00:22:11.004 --> 00:22:12.710\nlevels like file history.\n\n456\n00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:15.430\nWe'll definitely talk about that as well.\n\n457\n00:22:15.430 --> 00:22:18.210\nAll right, so here we go, we're gonna go\nahead and turn it on, and simply select my\n\n458\n00:22:18.210 --> 00:22:23.380\nvolume, and click configure, and then\nI'm going to turn on system protection.\n\n459\n00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:25.330\nI'll zoom out so\nyou can see where I'm at, right.\n\n460\n00:22:25.330 --> 00:22:28.511\nThere's just my properties for\nLocal Disk C, I'm gonna turn it on.\n\n461\n00:22:28.511 --> 00:22:32.306\nOops, and then my mouse is gonna jump,\ndon't you hate it when there's something\n\n462\n00:22:32.306 --> 00:22:35.980\ngrainy underneath your mouse and\nif you feel like you're sliding on sand?\n\n463\n00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:38.867\n&gt;&gt; Or when it's on your track pad and\nyour finger is sliding on sand.\n\n464\n00:22:38.867 --> 00:22:39.397\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.\n\n465\n00:22:39.397 --> 00:22:41.220\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n466\n00:22:41.220 --> 00:22:44.130\nhere's what again let me zoom in\nnow see if I can keep it centered.\n\n467\n00:22:44.130 --> 00:22:46.020\nThere we go.\nSo I turn it on,\n\n468\n00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:49.100\nbelow that I got my disk space usage.\n\n469\n00:22:49.100 --> 00:22:51.720\nAnd I will tell you that I've\ntested it out a little bit,\n\n470\n00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:54.440\nto make sure that everything\nis gonna work for the show.\n\n471\n00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:58.230\nBy default,\nit is slid all the way over to the right.\n\n472\n00:22:58.230 --> 00:23:03.050\nWhich means 100% of my drive can\nbe used for system restore points.\n\n473\n00:23:03.050 --> 00:23:07.590\nSo what you're deciding here is how much\nspace is allocated to store these system\n\n474\n00:23:07.590 --> 00:23:08.601\nrestore points.\n\n475\n00:23:08.601 --> 00:23:10.980\nAll right, how big are they?\n\n476\n00:23:10.980 --> 00:23:13.270\nWell that really depends on your system.\n\n477\n00:23:13.270 --> 00:23:17.010\nI think the ones I end up creating\nhere somewhere around 200, 250 megs.\n\n478\n00:23:17.010 --> 00:23:19.882\nSo they're not that big.\nThe more space you dedicate to restore\n\n479\n00:23:19.882 --> 00:23:23.370\npoints, the more restore\npoints you can keep.\n\n480\n00:23:23.370 --> 00:23:28.157\nSo that I can roll back to\ndifferent points in time.\n\n481\n00:23:28.157 --> 00:23:32.670\nBut I definitely don't want it eating up\nmy entire disc saving these restore points\n\n482\n00:23:32.670 --> 00:23:34.870\nand there's a couple of thoughts here.\n\n483\n00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:37.830\nI've read some interesting\nblogs that go back and\n\n484\n00:23:37.830 --> 00:23:40.780\nforth, do you need to\nkeep more than one or\n\n485\n00:23:40.780 --> 00:23:45.060\ntwo restore points, do you ever need\nto roll back five restore points?\n\n486\n00:23:45.060 --> 00:23:48.483\nI mean, remember what you're doing is\nyou're rolling back your system files and\n\n487\n00:23:48.483 --> 00:23:49.584\nconfiguration changes.\n\n488\n00:23:49.584 --> 00:23:53.922\nDo you ever want to go back on you system\nconfiguration changes to some time you\n\n489\n00:23:53.922 --> 00:23:55.004\nknow, last year?\n\n490\n00:23:55.004 --> 00:23:56.827\nProbably not.\n\n491\n00:23:56.827 --> 00:23:57.623\nSo, but that again,\n\n492\n00:23:57.623 --> 00:24:00.648\nthat's very something that you have to\ndecide in your particular environment.\n\n493\n00:24:00.648 --> 00:24:04.147\n&gt;&gt; It makes me wonder,\nI think there is a software limitation,\n\n494\n00:24:04.147 --> 00:24:07.663\nnot a hardware limitation,\nwith those previous versions.\n\n495\n00:24:07.663 --> 00:24:12.249\nI think it's like 64 or something crazy,\nregardless if you had like\n\n496\n00:24:12.249 --> 00:24:16.302\nbeaucoup Hardware storage space,\nit doesn't even matter.\n\n497\n00:24:16.302 --> 00:24:19.540\nIt would do that concept that you'd-\n&gt;&gt; FIFO.\n\n498\n00:24:19.540 --> 00:24:20.074\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n499\n00:24:20.074 --> 00:24:21.270\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, first in first out, and\n\n500\n00:24:21.270 --> 00:24:23.350\nthat's what it'll do if you\nran out of space as well.\n\n501\n00:24:23.350 --> 00:24:27.687\nIf I drop this down, I'm only giving it\nsix gigabytes of space, which I feel is\n\n502\n00:24:27.687 --> 00:24:32.356\nplenty that's gonna give me a few several\nrestore points that I can choose from, but\n\n503\n00:24:32.356 --> 00:24:35.940\nwhat will happen is eventually\nwe'll run out of space, right?\n\n504\n00:24:35.940 --> 00:24:37.870\nIt's gonna go to make a new restore point.\n\n505\n00:24:37.870 --> 00:24:40.640\nand I'm out of space, and\nit will take the oldest one and\n\n506\n00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:42.630\nthrow it out to make room for\nthe newest one.\n\n507\n00:24:42.630 --> 00:24:47.622\nSo it is a first in first out, okay,\nI do have this delete option here,\n\n508\n00:24:47.622 --> 00:24:50.428\nwhere I can delete all restore points.\n\n509\n00:24:50.428 --> 00:24:54.524\nI mean, if things are going well and\neverything's good maybe I just want to\n\n510\n00:24:54.524 --> 00:24:58.879\nkind of freshen up and clean out those\nold restore points, and create a new one,\n\n511\n00:24:58.879 --> 00:25:03.169\nand start over kinda if you will,\nespecially if you're giving it more space,\n\n512\n00:25:03.169 --> 00:25:05.920\nmaybe you wanna bump out\nsome of those older ones.\n\n513\n00:25:06.970 --> 00:25:08.580\nAll right, so I'll go ahead and click OK.\n\n514\n00:25:09.700 --> 00:25:13.892\nAnd we'll click OK on that wizard as well.\n\n515\n00:25:13.892 --> 00:25:18.470\nNow, it used to create Restore\npoint as soon as you enable it.\n\n516\n00:25:18.470 --> 00:25:19.920\nIt doesn't seem to.\n\n517\n00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:22.090\nThe documentation still says it does.\n\n518\n00:25:22.090 --> 00:25:23.760\nBut I didn't see it create one.\n\n519\n00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:25.270\nWhich is kind of interesting.\n\n520\n00:25:25.270 --> 00:25:27.929\nBut anyway,\nSystem Restore is now turned on.\n\n521\n00:25:27.929 --> 00:25:32.287\nSo what I wanna do is, well,\nactually let me take a look again,\n\n522\n00:25:32.287 --> 00:25:36.750\nif we go back into those same\nproperties and system protection.\n\n523\n00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:40.750\nAll right, I'll see it's turned on for\nlocal disk C, right, so\n\n524\n00:25:40.750 --> 00:25:42.340\nthat's what we just turned on, and\n\n525\n00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:47.330\nif I click configure now,\nit will show me the current utilization.\n\n526\n00:25:47.330 --> 00:25:50.210\nSo you can see it did\nnot automatically create\n\n527\n00:25:50.210 --> 00:25:52.710\na restore point when I enabled this.\n\n528\n00:25:52.710 --> 00:25:55.800\nBut that could be because I've enabled\nthis and turned it off, turned it back on,\n\n529\n00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:59.810\nturned it back off a couple times\ntesting things, but just keep that mind.\n\n530\n00:25:59.810 --> 00:26:02.990\nI know a lot of the documentation\nsays it gets created automatically as\n\n531\n00:26:02.990 --> 00:26:04.320\nsoon as you turn it on.\n\n532\n00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:05.270\nIt's something you wanna look at.\n\n533\n00:26:05.270 --> 00:26:05.970\n&gt;&gt; So it's better to check.\n\n534\n00:26:05.970 --> 00:26:08.890\n&gt;&gt; And you might wanna just go ahead and\ncreate an initial one.\n\n535\n00:26:08.890 --> 00:26:10.334\nAnd you can do that from right here,\nright?\n\n536\n00:26:10.334 --> 00:26:14.530\nOn the System Protection tab,\nnow, that I have it turned on,\n\n537\n00:26:14.530 --> 00:26:18.260\nI can go ahead and click Create and\nlet me give it a name.\n\n538\n00:26:19.620 --> 00:26:26.440\nI'll call it the show demo,\nand I'll click create.\n\n539\n00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:31.308\nThis will take it a minute or so to\ncreate, but it's now backing up all those\n\n540\n00:26:31.308 --> 00:26:36.331\nfiles or marking everything so that I\ncan again roll back to it, all right, so\n\n541\n00:26:36.331 --> 00:26:41.620\nonce this finishes we will take a look at\nhow we can utilize these restore points.\n\n542\n00:26:42.650 --> 00:26:45.990\nGive it just a second, while it's\nfinishing it up I'd just like to\n\n543\n00:26:45.990 --> 00:26:47.920\nclose some of my windows\nin the background.\n\n544\n00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:52.000\n&gt;&gt; There's a very call me\nvibe that this creates.\n\n545\n00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.130\nSo, I hope you guys are enjoying it,\ncuz I know I sure don't.\n\n546\n00:26:54.130 --> 00:26:55.972\nWe're just saving everything here.\n\n547\n00:26:55.972 --> 00:26:57.250\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We are.\n\n548\n00:26:57.250 --> 00:26:58.355\nWe feel safer now.\n\n549\n00:26:58.355 --> 00:26:58.960\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n550\n00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:02.980\n&gt;&gt; We are protected,\nour system has for it.\n\n551\n00:27:02.980 --> 00:27:04.765\nIt's a crazy world nowadays.\n\n552\n00:27:04.765 --> 00:27:06.200\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n553\n00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:10.200\nwe'll let this thing finish up and\nwhat I'm gonna do, I'm going to,\n\n554\n00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:14.252\nthis is an installer for\none of my fave little Notepad ++.\n\n555\n00:27:14.252 --> 00:27:20.305\nWe're gonna install it,\nand we'll also create.\n\n556\n00:27:20.305 --> 00:27:24.585\nLet me not jump the gun,\nlet it finish creating a restore point.\n\n557\n00:27:24.585 --> 00:27:26.114\nAnd I'm getting ready to\nstart messing things up here.\n\n558\n00:27:26.114 --> 00:27:27.521\n&gt;&gt; You're getting so excited.\n\n559\n00:27:27.521 --> 00:27:29.169\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I am excited.\n\n560\n00:27:29.169 --> 00:27:30.178\nI wanna show you this stuff,.\n\n561\n00:27:30.178 --> 00:27:33.700\nAll right, there we go the restore\npoint was created successfully.\n\n562\n00:27:33.700 --> 00:27:34.890\nI'll close that.\n\n563\n00:27:34.890 --> 00:27:39.380\nIf I click configure now,\nlet's take a look at my size, oops,\n\n564\n00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:44.130\nwrong keyboard shortcut there.\n\n565\n00:27:44.130 --> 00:27:45.020\nThere we go.\n\n566\n00:27:45.020 --> 00:27:46.300\n41 megs currently used.\n\n567\n00:27:46.300 --> 00:27:51.060\nSo that restore point did not\ntake a whole lot of space, right?\n\n568\n00:27:51.060 --> 00:27:53.720\nBut that depends on your registry and\nall of that.\n\n569\n00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:55.780\nAll right, so I'll click OK and OK.\n\n570\n00:27:55.780 --> 00:27:58.250\nSo we've got restore points turned on.\n\n571\n00:27:58.250 --> 00:28:01.430\nWe've created initial\n&gt;&gt; Snapshot it's not I\n\n572\n00:28:01.430 --> 00:28:03.710\nshouldn't say snapshot,\nlet's not use that terminology.\n\n573\n00:28:03.710 --> 00:28:07.150\nI've created a restore point,\na point in time that I can roll back to.\n\n574\n00:28:07.150 --> 00:28:10.410\nNow what I'm gonna do,\nis I'm gonna install an application.\n\n575\n00:28:10.410 --> 00:28:13.190\nSo doesn't matter what application\nI just pick this one in\n\n576\n00:28:13.190 --> 00:28:16.315\nparticular not trying to promote them\nalthough that is a great program.\n\n577\n00:28:16.315 --> 00:28:18.470\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna put a shortcut out on\n\n578\n00:28:18.470 --> 00:28:19.840\nthe desktop so we can see it.\n\n579\n00:28:22.430 --> 00:28:25.180\nAnd I know it's a nice, quick,\neasy program to install.\n\n580\n00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:32.770\nAnd we'll even launch it just to make sure\nthe application is running successfully.\n\n581\n00:28:32.770 --> 00:28:33.600\nAnd there we go.\n\n582\n00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:35.950\nWe've got a little Notepad++ action.\n\n583\n00:28:35.950 --> 00:28:37.720\nI'll leave the installer out there too.\n\n584\n00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:40.510\nI'm also gonna create a new document.\n\n585\n00:28:40.510 --> 00:28:47.760\nI'm gonna call it testdoc and I'll leave\nit right out here on my desktop as well.\n\n586\n00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:51.840\nAll right, so\nnow something's gone wrong, all right?\n\n587\n00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:53.520\nWe got a problem, we wanna roll back.\n\n588\n00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:57.990\nMaybe I installed an application\n&gt;&gt; And it's causing all kinds of problems.\n\n589\n00:28:57.990 --> 00:28:58.500\n&gt;&gt; System crashes.\n\n590\n00:28:58.500 --> 00:28:59.350\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n591\n00:28:59.350 --> 00:29:02.980\nIt's really an unstable random reboots and\n\n592\n00:29:02.980 --> 00:29:06.630\nI think it's that program I just\ninstalled or something like that.\n\n593\n00:29:06.630 --> 00:29:09.520\nSo I wanna try a restore point,\nand see if that fixes the problem.\n\n594\n00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:11.720\nAnd I mentioned at\nthe beginning of the show,\n\n595\n00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:15.050\nwhen we think about these\ndifferent solutions for the exam.\n\n596\n00:29:15.050 --> 00:29:18.900\nWe wanna try to focus in\non what they're fixing and\n\n597\n00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:20.490\nwhen they would be good to use, right?\n\n598\n00:29:20.490 --> 00:29:24.080\nAnd that first one we did,\nthe recovery drive,\n\n599\n00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:27.640\nthat's the one I wanna use\nif I cannot boot my system.\n\n600\n00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:31.240\nIf I can't successfully\nstart up my computer and\n\n601\n00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:34.910\nget logged into my computer,\nthe recovery drive is the way to go,\n\n602\n00:29:34.910 --> 00:29:37.050\nbecause that allows me\nto start the system.\n\n603\n00:29:37.050 --> 00:29:40.917\nI can get a command prompt or I can\nreapply an image or I can try some of\n\n604\n00:29:40.917 --> 00:29:45.837\nthose other recovery environment utilities\nthat Windows 10 makes us available.\n\n605\n00:29:45.837 --> 00:29:50.389\nIf it's an application that's causing a\nproblem there's no reason to break out my\n\n606\n00:29:50.389 --> 00:29:51.830\nrecovery drive, right?\n\n607\n00:29:51.830 --> 00:29:53.580\nThat might be a little extreme.\n\n608\n00:29:53.580 --> 00:29:57.700\nThere's less intrusive options to try,\none of them being restore points.\n\n609\n00:29:57.700 --> 00:30:00.050\nAnd we always want to go with\nthe easiest first, right?\n\n610\n00:30:00.050 --> 00:30:02.590\nTry the easiest,\nleast intrusive methods first.\n\n611\n00:30:02.590 --> 00:30:04.270\nIf they work, great.\n\n612\n00:30:04.270 --> 00:30:06.980\nIf they don't,\nwell at least I tried the easy stuff and\n\n613\n00:30:06.980 --> 00:30:09.930\nnow we'll move onto the more difficult\nstuff or the more intrusive.\n\n614\n00:30:09.930 --> 00:30:12.210\nThe stuff where I might start losing data.\n\n615\n00:30:12.210 --> 00:30:13.750\nNot that this way I think\nwe'll lose your data,\n\n616\n00:30:13.750 --> 00:30:16.490\nbut I'm saying,\nas we work through the different methods.\n\n617\n00:30:16.490 --> 00:30:18.080\nAll right, so Cherokee,\nthat's enough of me babbling.\n\n618\n00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:21.010\nLet's get back into that System Restore,\nso I'm gonna-\n\n619\n00:30:21.010 --> 00:30:22.300\n&gt;&gt; Let's travel back in time.\n\n620\n00:30:22.300 --> 00:30:23.504\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, let's do it.\n\n621\n00:30:23.504 --> 00:30:24.819\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n622\n00:30:24.819 --> 00:30:28.190\nI'm gonna go into my system protection.\n\n623\n00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:34.480\nAnd we are going to go to System Restore.\n\n624\n00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:37.920\nLet me zoom in so you guys can see that,\nso you can undo system changes,\n\n625\n00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:39.060\nI'm going to click System Restore.\n\n626\n00:30:39.060 --> 00:30:40.080\nSomething has gone wrong.\n\n627\n00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:45.030\nYou can remember we saw this also\nin the recovery utility is when we\n\n628\n00:30:45.030 --> 00:30:49.670\nlaunched to the recovery drive\nIf I couldn't launch my system,\n\n629\n00:30:49.670 --> 00:30:51.840\nI could boot to the recovery drive and\n\n630\n00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:57.060\nthen get access to my restore points from\nthere before I try to reapply an image.\n\n631\n00:30:58.590 --> 00:31:01.640\nAll right, so\nit can restore my files and settings.\n\n632\n00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:04.790\nAnd note what it says,\nas I've already told you So\n\n633\n00:31:04.790 --> 00:31:07.350\nmy zoom program is getting a little laggy.\n\n634\n00:31:07.350 --> 00:31:09.780\nSystem Restore does not affect any\nof your documents, pictures or\n\n635\n00:31:09.780 --> 00:31:10.930\nother personal data.\n\n636\n00:31:10.930 --> 00:31:14.910\nRecently installed programs and\ndrivers may be uninstall.\n\n637\n00:31:14.910 --> 00:31:15.700\nSo we click next.\n\n638\n00:31:17.090 --> 00:31:21.830\nAnd I really like the lay out here\nYou know what it's showing me, is and\n\n639\n00:31:21.830 --> 00:31:24.590\nlet me zoom back in for you,\nsorry not trying to make you dizzy.\n\n640\n00:31:24.590 --> 00:31:27.830\nYou can see the date and\ntime that that restore point was created,\n\n641\n00:31:27.830 --> 00:31:31.590\nthis can help me if I've got several\nrestore points listed there,\n\n642\n00:31:31.590 --> 00:31:33.900\nfigure out which one it\nis I need to go back to.\n\n643\n00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:38.178\nGot the description that I typed in,\nyou can see it was manually created,\n\n644\n00:31:38.178 --> 00:31:42.939\nthat means it's not one that was created\nautomatically by Windows 10 I'm going\n\n645\n00:31:42.939 --> 00:31:47.297\nto select it and then I had this button\ndown here scan for affected program.\n\n646\n00:31:47.297 --> 00:31:49.512\nI'm gonna go ahead and click that.\n\n647\n00:31:49.512 --> 00:31:50.730\nWe'll let this run for\n\n648\n00:31:50.730 --> 00:31:54.913\njust a second I'll probably cancel it\nBecause this does take a little while.\n\n649\n00:31:54.913 --> 00:31:57.071\nAnd what it's doing,\nit's looking at my registry.\n\n650\n00:31:57.071 --> 00:32:01.250\nAnd it's looking at recent entries and\nit's trying to determine if going back in\n\n651\n00:32:01.250 --> 00:32:04.560\ntime is going to cause a problem for\nthat application.\n\n652\n00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:07.650\nNow, I don't have any other\napplications on here, so\n\n653\n00:32:07.650 --> 00:32:11.820\nI'm going to cancel this\njust we can finish this up.\n\n654\n00:32:11.820 --> 00:32:14.770\nBut in the real world you would\ndefinitely wanna let this run so\n\n655\n00:32:14.770 --> 00:32:16.300\nthat it can find everything.\n\n656\n00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:20.460\nPrograms and drivers that might\nnot work and it'll tell you.\n\n657\n00:32:20.460 --> 00:32:25.430\nIf I zoom into this window,\nyou can see the top half, programs and\n\n658\n00:32:25.430 --> 00:32:27.290\ndrivers that will be deleted.\n\n659\n00:32:27.290 --> 00:32:29.630\nIt's telling me there's no hope for\nNotepad++.\n\n660\n00:32:29.630 --> 00:32:32.670\nIt will be removed when I go\nto this restore point and\n\n661\n00:32:32.670 --> 00:32:34.150\nI'm gonna have to reinstall it.\n\n662\n00:32:34.150 --> 00:32:38.920\nAll right, down below, these are drivers\nand programs that might be restored.\n\n663\n00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:40.910\nThey might or\nmight not work after you roll back,\n\n664\n00:32:40.910 --> 00:32:42.340\nit's something you're gonna have to check.\n\n665\n00:32:42.340 --> 00:32:44.405\nBut the fact that I get\nthis list is really cool,\n\n666\n00:32:44.405 --> 00:32:48.250\nbecause I can screenshot this, or write\nthese down real quick, make a mental note.\n\n667\n00:32:48.250 --> 00:32:51.820\nAnd then I know hey, I know I'm gonna\nhave to reinstall Notepad++ and\n\n668\n00:32:51.820 --> 00:32:55.960\nI might have to reinstall the mouse\ndriver, or whatever it listed here.\n\n669\n00:32:55.960 --> 00:32:59.020\nSo I'll go ahead and close that.\n\n670\n00:33:00.150 --> 00:33:03.540\nOnce I got my list and\nthen I'll click next and\n\n671\n00:33:03.540 --> 00:33:06.980\nit tells me what it's getting ready to do.\n\n672\n00:33:06.980 --> 00:33:07.850\nOne last chance.\n\n673\n00:33:07.850 --> 00:33:11.780\nAlso notice this, if you changed\nyour Windows password recently.\n\n674\n00:33:11.780 --> 00:33:15.080\nWe recommend that you create\na password reset disk.\n\n675\n00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:16.710\nBecause we are rolling back in time,\n\n676\n00:33:16.710 --> 00:33:20.240\nthere's a potential that my\npassword might not be right.\n\n677\n00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:22.260\nI might have to try my old password,\n\n678\n00:33:22.260 --> 00:33:24.750\nI might have problems\ngetting back into the system.\n\n679\n00:33:24.750 --> 00:33:26.880\nSo if you have changed\nyour password recently,\n\n680\n00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:30.230\nmake sure you make a reset\ndisk just in case.\n\n681\n00:33:30.230 --> 00:33:32.620\nWe'll click Finish and it tells me,\n\n682\n00:33:32.620 --> 00:33:36.230\nthis is it, no more, if you click yes,\nwe are going to start.\n\n683\n00:33:36.230 --> 00:33:37.220\n&gt;&gt; Lots of warnings here\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n\n684\n00:33:37.220 --> 00:33:39.250\nAnd that's because you can't cancel it.\n\n685\n00:33:39.250 --> 00:33:44.080\nIf you've ever used this before, you know\nonce it starts, there is no stopping it.\n\n686\n00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:45.680\nIt is going to roll.\n\n687\n00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:48.440\nNo guarantee that it's going to work and\nwe'll talk about that.\n\n688\n00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:51.100\nBut it is not going to, you can't stop it.\n\n689\n00:33:51.100 --> 00:33:52.860\nI don't know, hard power down the system,\n\n690\n00:33:52.860 --> 00:33:54.570\nyou're definitely gonna\nhose everything up.\n\n691\n00:33:54.570 --> 00:33:55.930\nAll right, so I'm gonna click Yes, and\n\n692\n00:33:55.930 --> 00:33:59.110\nthen we're gonna wrap this show\nup because we are out of time.\n\n693\n00:33:59.110 --> 00:34:01.790\nWhen we come back in our part two,\nCherokee,\n\n694\n00:34:01.790 --> 00:34:04.680\nmaybe we can see the results\nof our system restore.\n\n695\n00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:05.990\n&gt;&gt; Okay, sounds like a plan, Mike.\n\n696\n00:34:05.990 --> 00:34:07.760\nThank you so much for\nthat great information.\n\n697\n00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:11.650\nI feel a little bit better about any\nkind of emergencies that may happen.\n\n698\n00:34:11.650 --> 00:34:13.120\nIn between now and the next show so\n\n699\n00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:16.620\nyou guys definitely want to make sure\nyou come back for that next show.\n\n700\n00:34:16.620 --> 00:34:19.370\nFor now let's sign out,\nI've been your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n701\n00:34:19.370 --> 00:34:20.270\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Roderick.\n\n702\n00:34:20.270 --> 00:34:22.634\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n703\n00:34:22.634 -->

California.\n\n3\n00:00:06.126 --> 00:00:09.350\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; You're\n\n4\n00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:12.590\nwatching ITProTV.\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to\n\n5\n00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:17.720\nyour Configure Windows Devices Series,\nstudying up for that 70-697 exam.\n\n6\n00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.110\nI'm your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:24.070\nIn this episode, we'll continue taking\na look at our system recovery options.\n\n8\n00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.292\nAnd you know it,\nwith us today back in studios, we have Mr.\n\n9\n00:00:27.292 --> 00:00:29.560\nMike Rodrick.\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing good Cherokee,\n\n10\n00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:30.780\nthanks for having me.\n\n11\n00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:32.650\nHow are you doing?\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing lovely.\n\n12\n00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:36.480\nYou know, I said I was feeling better\nabout that last show because you were\n\n13\n00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.870\nshowing us some really cool\nthings that we could do.\n\n14\n00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:40.180\nIn the event of any emergency.\n\n15\n00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:41.950\nSo.\n[Laughter] Right.\n\n16\n00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:43.920\nAlways good to be prepared right?\n\n17\n00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.800\nThat's our Boys Scout motto.\n\n18\n00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.410\nThere we go.\n&gt;&gt; And I think they did promise us more of\n\n19\n00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:49.200\nthat in the show.\n\n20\n00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.150\nAnd that's like really exciting.\n\n21\n00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:51.260\nI think.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah absolutely.\n\n22\n00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.230\nWe left off in the middle of\nperforming a system restore.\n\n23\n00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:56.080\nRight?\nWe went through the process\n\n24\n00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.060\nof enabling system restore on our C drive.\n\n25\n00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:00.910\nWe created a restore point.\n\n26\n00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:02.320\nAnd then if you remember,\n\n27\n00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.470\nafter we created a restore point\nwe installed an application or\n\n28\n00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:10.260\nin our case, Notepad++ and\nI also made a text file on our desktop.\n\n29\n00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.180\nAnd now if we join me in my screen here.\n\n30\n00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.220\nThe system rebooted so\nI haven't touched it.\n\n31\n00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.170\nAfter it went through it took it,\nprobably most of that time we were gone.\n\n32\n00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.520\nI know you guys have no\nidea how long that was.\n\n33\n00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.150\nSo about 15 minutes or so and that can\nvary, again depending on your system.\n\n34\n00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.470\nBut I am going to log back\nin to my Windows 10 client,\n\n35\n00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:34.020\nif I put the right password.\n\n36\n00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.830\nHopefully, we shall see, looks good and\nlet's see what my system looks like it\n\n37\n00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:46.670\nshould give me a little message, letting\nme know hey, the system restore worked.\n\n38\n00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:48.780\nLet's see if it does.\n\n39\n00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.850\nMaybe, maybe not, there we go,\nI knew it was coming.\n\n40\n00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.810\nAll right, so if I zoom in,\nyou know what, zoom it.\n\n41\n00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.830\nActually was not on that list.\n\n42\n00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:00.370\nI wonder if it's just not started yet.\n\n43\n00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:02.260\nLet's see here.\n\n44\n00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:03.260\nGive me just a second.\n\n45\n00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.520\nGotta let Windows 10 get everything up and\nrunning.\n\n46\n00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.951\nSee if I can zoom in, there we go.\n\n47\n00:02:08.951 --> 00:02:12.626\nBecause zoom in is a program, but\nI installed that well before we created\n\n48\n00:02:12.626 --> 00:02:15.190\nthe restore point so\nit should still be there.\n\n49\n00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:16.040\nThere it is.\n\n50\n00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.990\nSo there is our message.\n\n51\n00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:18.620\nSystem Restore completed successfully.\n\n52\n00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.920\nThe system has been restored\nto our date and our time.\n\n53\n00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.730\nYour documents have not been affected.\n\n54\n00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.120\nHave them?\nLet's check and see.\n\n55\n00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.970\nWe'll click close in our little message,\nwe'll zoom back out.\n\n56\n00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.060\nAnd notice in my desktop,\nI have the installer.\n\n57\n00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.750\nAnd you'll actually notice\nthe installer is back over here.\n\n58\n00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.320\nI had it lined up over here.\n\n59\n00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.560\nIt's kind of moved to\nits original position.\n\n60\n00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.094\nMy Text.doc is still there, though, right?\n\n61\n00:02:40.094 --> 00:02:44.159\nRemember, it says it doesn't\naffect your personal files,\n\n62\n00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:46.870\nbut the icon for Notepad++ is gone.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n63\n00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:48.040\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n64\n00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.120\nnow here's where it gets\na little interesting.\n\n65\n00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:55.777\nI'm gonna go to my start menu and\nI'm gonna type in Notepad and let's see.\n\n66\n00:02:58.127 --> 00:02:59.580\nNothing, right?\n\n67\n00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:05.490\nNow I will tell you that in testing this,\nI have come back here, typed in Notepad++.\n\n68\n00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:08.210\nAnd seen it show up on my list.\n\n69\n00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:11.690\nProbably Windows was still cleaning\nup a couple things in the background,\n\n70\n00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:14.380\nbut it's something I want to make\nyou aware of is sometimes there\n\n71\n00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.840\nwill be remnants of applications left.\n\n72\n00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.920\nYou might see the icon\nstill on the desktop, or\n\n73\n00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:25.610\nif you append it to your task bar,\nyou might still see it down there.\n\n74\n00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:28.420\nBecause when it rolls those\nregistry settings back,\n\n75\n00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.360\nsometimes those shortcuts and things like\nthat aren't part of, not stored there.\n\n76\n00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.540\nAnd doesn't see them as\nneeding to be rolled back.\n\n77\n00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.460\nAnd so you might say it's still there.\n\n78\n00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:39.190\nYou try to launch it, and\nit doesn't launch because most of\n\n79\n00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.440\nthe registry entries have been removed for\nthat application.\n\n80\n00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:45.650\nSo just be aware of that,\nthere might be some things left.\n\n81\n00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:48.110\nTypically if you pinned it, like I say,\nif you pinned it to your Task bar,\n\n82\n00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:49.730\nyou'll still see the icon there.\n\n83\n00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:52.030\nYou click on it, and\nWindows will tell you hey,\n\n84\n00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.700\nI can no longer find the file\nthat the shortcut is pointing to.\n\n85\n00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:01.980\nYou say yes or you just delete it\nyourself manually, but it is gone.\n\n86\n00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:05.633\nAnd that is because the registry\nhas been rolled back and\n\n87\n00:04:05.633 --> 00:04:07.803\nmy file is still there.\n&gt;&gt; We're saved!\n\n88\n00:04:07.803 --> 00:04:08.848\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and\n\n89\n00:04:08.848 --> 00:04:12.600\nthose are the keys to remember\nabout system restore points.\n\n90\n00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.990\nIs, for the exam, right,\nis we're rolling back system settings,\n\n91\n00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:21.100\nmy registry settings, drivers,\nnot your personal files.\n\n92\n00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:25.680\nSo if they want you to find a solution\nthat doesn't affect your personal data,\n\n93\n00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.400\nrestore points would be your answer.\n\n94\n00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.760\nAll right, I will also tell you that\nrestore points have gotten better\n\n95\n00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:33.550\nover the years that they've been out.\n\n96\n00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:36.410\nI said this wasn't the first\nrelease of Restore points,\n\n97\n00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:39.240\nthey've been in our operating system for\nsome time, at least back to XP.\n\n98\n00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.880\nI will tell you that there are times\nI've used restore points and\n\n99\n00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:46.180\nit's gone through this whole process,\nit's taken 30 minutes\n\n100\n00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:50.120\nof reboots to your system,\ntells you it's applying your changes.\n\n101\n00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:55.250\nAnd then it comes up with a message that\nsays unable to restore your restore point.\n\n102\n00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:58.750\nWe are rolling back, all right and\nnothing has changed.\n\n103\n00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:01.270\nSometimes those restore\npoints can get corrupt I\n\n104\n00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:04.780\nthink Cherokee you were talking about\nusing restore points with malware.\n\n105\n00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:07.340\nOne of the things a lot of\nmalware might try to do\n\n106\n00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:10.440\nis affect those restore points\nbecause they know if you do or\n\n107\n00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.860\nuse a restore point it rolls\nback their registry settings.\n\n108\n00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:18.280\nSo they lose their hooks for\ntheir malware things like that and so\n\n109\n00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:21.190\nthey will try to mess\nwith you system restore.\n\n110\n00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:22.820\nSo keep that in mind.\n\n111\n00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:26.780\nIt's definitely not the best solution if\nwe're trying to recover from malware.\n\n112\n00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:29.866\nAll right so that is Restore points.\n\n113\n00:05:29.866 --> 00:05:33.540\nI want to do a little bit\nmore with restore points.\n\n114\n00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:38.960\nI think we've got the concept, but\nWindows loves their PowerShell.\n\n115\n00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:40.830\nEspecially on the exam.\n\n116\n00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:44.180\nSo we are going to launch\nPowerShell as an administrator and\n\n117\n00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:46.840\njust quickly take a look\nat some of the commands.\n\n118\n00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:50.250\nActually let me flip over\nto this machine here.\n\n119\n00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:50.830\nI think my.\n\n120\n00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:55.476\nMy powershell is already\nset with a nice large\n\n121\n00:05:55.476 --> 00:05:56.010\n&gt;&gt; I was typing.\n\n122\n00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:56.564\n&gt;&gt; Large,\n\n123\n00:05:56.564 --> 00:05:59.793\nfont.\n&gt;&gt; Yey, large fonts for the win.\n\n124\n00:05:59.793 --> 00:06:01.410\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes and\n\n125\n00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:03.950\nsystem restore isn't turned on here I want\nto show you how to turn it on because\n\n126\n00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:07.080\nwe can manage system\nrestore from power shell.\n\n127\n00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:11.420\nAlright so let's just verify I'm\ngoing to open up file explorer.\n\n128\n00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:13.796\nPull up my system properties.\n\n129\n00:06:15.497 --> 00:06:16.383\nGo into my system protection.\n\n130\n00:06:20.138 --> 00:06:23.200\nAnd eventually, there we go,\nI can see that it is turned off.\n\n131\n00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:25.880\nYou can also see that it is\navailable on that E drive.\n\n132\n00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:27.540\nI could enable it there.\n\n133\n00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:31.280\nNow if I try to enable it here,\nNotice it's not turned on for\n\n134\n00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:34.030\nmy system drive,\nI'm selecting a second volum.\n\n135\n00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:40.750\nI'm gonna click configure and you see the\noption turn it on is not available, right?\n\n136\n00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:42.560\nThat because there\nare system files on their,\n\n137\n00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:46.050\nif I turned it on the C drive first,\nenabled it\n\n138\n00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:50.800\nthen came back into this window, it would\nlet me turn it on for the E drive as well.\n\n139\n00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:53.890\nBut as I said earlier, I'm really not\nprotecting anything because I don't have\n\n140\n00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:56.980\nany system files on that e drive.\n\n141\n00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:57.670\nAll right.\n\n142\n00:06:57.670 --> 00:06:59.170\nI'm going to click okay to this.\n\n143\n00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:04.180\nWe're going to get rid of that and\nleave this minimized.\n\n144\n00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:07.240\nAnd we're gonna launch\npowershell as an administrator.\n\n145\n00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:13.370\nAll right, so let's take a look,\nthere's not that many commands,\n\n146\n00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:16.680\nI'm gonna do a get command and\n\n147\n00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:22.370\nlet's do restore asterisk then we'll\ntake a look and there's a few of them.\n\n148\n00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:25.920\nSome of these like restore VM checkpoint\nwas for virtual machines and Hyper-V's, so\n\n149\n00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:27.510\nwe're not worried about that.\n\n150\n00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:30.430\nThe one's we're looking at\nare enable computer restore.\n\n151\n00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:34.720\nThis would be the same thing as going\nin an turning system restore points on.\n\n152\n00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:35.620\nDisable.\n\n153\n00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:38.040\nComputer restore would be turning it off.\n\n154\n00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:40.790\nGet computer restore\npoint is going to list\n\n155\n00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:42.800\nall the restore points I have available.\n\n156\n00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:48.850\nRestore computer is how I can roll\nback to a previous restore point, and\n\n157\n00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:52.060\nthe rest of those are actually\ndealing with VMs and UEVs so\n\n158\n00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:55.610\nthey don't matter in this particular show.\n&gt;&gt; Looking at that list and\n\n159\n00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:57.370\nlooking at our verb-noun syntax.\n\n160\n00:07:57.370 --> 00:07:59.383\nI don't see anything like new.\n\n161\n00:07:59.383 --> 00:08:05.909\nDo we have that option?\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it's actually where is it?\n\n162\n00:08:05.909 --> 00:08:08.100\nIt doesn't have the word\nrestore in it is the problem.\n\n163\n00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:08.646\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n164\n00:08:08.646 --> 00:08:09.971\n&gt;&gt; It's going to be-\n\n165\n00:08:09.971 --> 00:08:12.407\n&gt;&gt; We did the asterisk for the search.\n\n166\n00:08:12.407 --> 00:08:16.896\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so if I do a get-command *,\n\n167\n00:08:16.896 --> 00:08:19.150\nwhat is that one?\n\n168\n00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:23.044\nLet's just do computer,\ncuz it's like checkpoint-computer.\n\n169\n00:08:23.044 --> 00:08:24.563\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I'm just wondering,\n\n170\n00:08:24.563 --> 00:08:27.982\nsometimes you're not able to but\nI've got everything else here.\n\n171\n00:08:27.982 --> 00:08:31.782\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, where is it?\n\n172\n00:08:31.782 --> 00:08:34.200\nCheckpoint-computer, that's the command.\n\n173\n00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:37.822\nAnd I will tell you that PowerShell is\nnormally very good with their syntax and\n\n174\n00:08:37.822 --> 00:08:39.230\nvery consistent.\n\n175\n00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:45.104\nI think the problem here with restore\npoints is they've kind of merged restore\n\n176\n00:08:45.104 --> 00:08:51.158\npoints, checkpoints, the terminology\nhas changed over the last iterations.\n\n177\n00:08:51.158 --> 00:08:53.859\nSo I think there is a little bit of\ndisconnect in here as far as that\n\n178\n00:08:53.859 --> 00:08:54.609\ngoes, cuz yeah,\n\n179\n00:08:54.609 --> 00:08:56.993\nyou'd think you'd see all of the commands.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n180\n00:08:56.993 --> 00:08:58.336\n&gt;&gt; With that one search, but you don't.\n\n181\n00:08:58.336 --> 00:09:01.670\nAll right, so let me clean that up and\nlet's first turn it on.\n\n182\n00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:06.333\nWe're gonna type in enable,\nif I can spell,\n\n183\n00:09:06.333 --> 00:09:11.631\n-computerRestore, all right,\njust hit Enter.\n\n184\n00:09:11.631 --> 00:09:15.350\nAnd it tells me, wait,\nyou need to tell me what drive.\n\n185\n00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:20.826\nSo I'm gonna hit Esc or I'm gonna cancel\nout this command, I think I'm going to.\n\n186\n00:09:20.826 --> 00:09:22.450\nI've locked it up now, it's really mad.\n\n187\n00:09:22.450 --> 00:09:25.100\nWhen you enable computer restore\nthink about the GUI, right?\n\n188\n00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:28.684\nYou have to select your volume\nthat you wanna protect, and\n\n189\n00:09:28.684 --> 00:09:30.376\nthen choose to configure.\n\n190\n00:09:30.376 --> 00:09:37.115\nSo let me clear that screen again,\nand let's do that one more time,\n\n191\n00:09:37.115 --> 00:09:43.275\nEnable-ComputerRestore, and\nthen I'm gonna do -drive,\n\n192\n00:09:45.295 --> 00:09:50.151\nAnd you should put this\nin quotes probably, c:\\.\n\n193\n00:09:50.151 --> 00:09:54.090\nI'll tell you you can get away without the\nquotes, but I'll just leave it like that,\n\n194\n00:09:54.090 --> 00:09:55.140\nand we'll hit Enter.\n\n195\n00:09:57.833 --> 00:09:58.980\nGive it just a second.\n\n196\n00:10:01.892 --> 00:10:05.119\nAnd there we go, and you know how\nPowerShell is, I don't get anything back,\n\n197\n00:10:05.119 --> 00:10:07.530\nno red text, that's usually a good thing.\n\n198\n00:10:07.530 --> 00:10:12.090\nAnd go back over to my System properties\nhere, open up System Protection, and\n\n199\n00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:15.006\nyou'll notice that it is now on,\non that C drive.\n\n200\n00:10:15.006 --> 00:10:19.615\nI wanted to turn it on for E:,\nsame thing, just -Drive E:.\n\n201\n00:10:19.615 --> 00:10:22.152\nAll right, I will cancel that, and\n\n202\n00:10:22.152 --> 00:10:26.570\nwe'll zoom back out,\nget back over to have PowerShell.\n\n203\n00:10:26.570 --> 00:10:29.895\nSo Enable-ComputerRestore is\ngonna enable restore points.\n\n204\n00:10:29.895 --> 00:10:34.740\nOne required parameter,\nthat is gonna be that -Drive, all right?\n\n205\n00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:38.569\nNow, if I want to list restore points,\n\n206\n00:10:38.569 --> 00:10:42.633\nit's Get-ComputerRestorePoint, and\n\n207\n00:10:42.633 --> 00:10:47.518\nI don't have any cuz we\nhaven't created any yet.\n\n208\n00:10:47.518 --> 00:10:49.460\nRemember, it doesn't\nautomatically create one.\n\n209\n00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:52.198\nWell, even some of\nthe documentation says it does,\n\n210\n00:10:52.198 --> 00:10:55.631\nit doesn't seem to automatically\ncreate one when you turn it on.\n\n211\n00:10:55.631 --> 00:10:59.220\nSo to create one,\nwe're gonna just type in checkpoint,\n\n212\n00:11:01.745 --> 00:11:06.700\n-Computer, now there's a couple of\nparameters, I wanna use with this.\n\n213\n00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:08.371\nOne is gonna be -Description.\n\n214\n00:11:08.371 --> 00:11:10.958\nRemember how I put in there, I forget\nwhat I did, something to show the demo?\n\n215\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:12.102\n&gt;&gt; Before update, or\n\n216\n00:11:12.102 --> 00:11:16.827\nbefore I install a particular application\nor something to help you remember.\n\n217\n00:11:16.827 --> 00:11:17.525\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so\n\n218\n00:11:17.525 --> 00:11:19.468\nwhen you're looking at\nthat list of checkpoints,\n\n219\n00:11:19.468 --> 00:11:20.742\nwhich one do I wanna roll back to?\n\n220\n00:11:20.742 --> 00:11:22.680\nSo be descriptive in this.\n\n221\n00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:26.381\nWe'll call this one second demo or\nsomething like that.\n\n222\n00:11:26.381 --> 00:11:29.651\nEven though this is a different machine,\nbut just for giggles.\n\n223\n00:11:29.651 --> 00:11:34.900\nAnd then the other one that\nI'm going to need is, gosh.\n\n224\n00:11:37.436 --> 00:11:42.875\nRestorePointType, that was what it was, it\ntook me for a second, -RestorePointType.\n\n225\n00:11:42.875 --> 00:11:47.370\nNow this one, I wanna say I\ncan get away without this one.\n\n226\n00:11:47.370 --> 00:11:49.088\nIn fact, we should try it just to see.\n\n227\n00:11:49.088 --> 00:11:53.129\nThere are a few restore point types,\nAPPLICATION_INSTALL,\n\n228\n00:11:53.129 --> 00:11:54.966\nAPPLICATION_UNINSTALL.\n\n229\n00:11:54.966 --> 00:11:56.565\nAnd I'm simply hitting my Tab key,\n\n230\n00:11:56.565 --> 00:11:58.976\ntake advantage of PowerShell's auto fill,\nright?\n\n231\n00:11:58.976 --> 00:12:01.042\nI don't know what parameter\nI wanna choose, so\n\n232\n00:12:01.042 --> 00:12:02.704\nI've just typed the parameter name.\n\n233\n00:12:02.704 --> 00:12:05.880\nAnd now I'm hitting Tab to cycle\nthrough all of the options, right?\n\n234\n00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:08.584\nAPPLICATION_UNINSTALL,\nCANCELLED_OPERATION,\n\n235\n00:12:08.584 --> 00:12:11.112\nDEVICE_DRIVER_INSTALL, MODIFY_SETTINGS,\n\n236\n00:12:11.112 --> 00:12:14.234\nand then I'm back to the beginning,\nAPPLICATION_INSTALL.\n\n237\n00:12:14.234 --> 00:12:19.305\nThis really doesn't change\nthe restore point, it's more of a-\n\n238\n00:12:19.305 --> 00:12:19.980\n&gt;&gt; Like a label?\n\n239\n00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:21.018\n&gt;&gt; At least from what I've seen, yes.\n\n240\n00:12:21.018 --> 00:12:24.710\nI've looked through all of\nthe documentation trying to figure out,\n\n241\n00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:28.404\nwell what is the difference if I\nchoose APPLICATION_INSTALL versus\n\n242\n00:12:28.404 --> 00:12:29.562\nMODIFY_SETTINGS.\n\n243\n00:12:29.562 --> 00:12:33.324\nI can't find anything in Microsoft's\ndocumentation that says it does anything\n\n244\n00:12:33.324 --> 00:12:35.400\nin the background any differently.\n\n245\n00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:38.730\nAnd you'll notice that when you do\nthe restore points through the GUI,\n\n246\n00:12:38.730 --> 00:12:41.299\nyou don't tell it,\nthis is an APPLICATION_INSTALL, or\n\n247\n00:12:41.299 --> 00:12:43.320\nto MODIFY_SETTINGS, or anything like that.\n\n248\n00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:47.159\nSo I really think it's more about\nthe system just tagging it or something.\n\n249\n00:12:47.159 --> 00:12:51.720\nBut anyway, let's try it without that at\nall, let's see if it's even required.\n\n250\n00:12:53.869 --> 00:12:55.450\nAnd doesn't look like it is.\n\n251\n00:12:55.450 --> 00:12:59.094\nSo there you go,\nit is just a label, all right.\n\n252\n00:12:59.094 --> 00:13:03.994\n[COUGH] But the description is required,\nif you don't type a description,\n\n253\n00:13:03.994 --> 00:13:07.592\nit'll prompt you in PowerShell\nto add a description.\n\n254\n00:13:07.592 --> 00:13:08.771\n&gt;&gt; So they wanna help us remember?\n\n255\n00:13:08.771 --> 00:13:11.039\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; They do, they do, as required-\n\n256\n00:13:11.039 --> 00:13:12.081\n&gt;&gt; They know how bad my-\n\n257\n00:13:12.081 --> 00:13:12.641\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n258\n00:13:12.641 --> 00:13:13.286\n&gt;&gt; Memory is, Mike.\n\n259\n00:13:13.286 --> 00:13:16.574\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, [LAUGH] all right.\n\n260\n00:13:16.574 --> 00:13:18.000\nSo we'll let this finish up.\n\n261\n00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.697\nYou can see that I got that nice progress\nbar up there creating that system\n\n262\n00:13:22.697 --> 00:13:23.778\nrestore point.\n\n263\n00:13:23.778 --> 00:13:26.600\nShouldn't take it too terribly long.\n\n264\n00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:27.830\nSo we've seen three commands so far.\n\n265\n00:13:27.830 --> 00:13:30.570\nWe've seen the Enable-ComputerRestore.\n\n266\n00:13:30.570 --> 00:13:31.460\nI didn't show you, but\n\n267\n00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:34.850\nI said there's a Disable-ComputerRestore\nif I wanted to turn it off.\n\n268\n00:13:34.850 --> 00:13:36.786\nWe saw checkpoint-computer,\n\n269\n00:13:36.786 --> 00:13:40.160\nwhich is what's creating\nthe restore point right now.\n\n270\n00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:43.536\nWe also saw Get-ComputerRestore\npoint which I'm gonna run again,\n\n271\n00:13:43.536 --> 00:13:47.509\nnow that we've got a checkpoint, which\ngives me a list of all of my checkpoints.\n\n272\n00:13:49.170 --> 00:13:52.996\nSo we'll again, just kinda install here\nfor a minute cuz there's really not a lot\n\n273\n00:13:52.996 --> 00:13:56.021\nI can do until it finishes.\n&gt;&gt; We can talk about Cheerios, because you\n\n274\n00:13:56.021 --> 00:13:59.645\nalways say that when we're waiting we see\nour spinning Cheerios, but this is the one\n\n275\n00:13:59.645 --> 00:14:02.232\nthat always reminds me of Cheerios, Mike.\n&gt;&gt; It does look like\n\n276\n00:14:02.232 --> 00:14:03.012\na nice-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n277\n00:14:03.012 --> 00:14:03.954\n&gt;&gt; Row of little Cheerios.\n\n278\n00:14:03.954 --> 00:14:04.757\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n279\n00:14:04.757 --> 00:14:07.241\n&gt;&gt; Across the baby seat, right?\n\n280\n00:14:07.241 --> 00:14:09.699\nKinda making me hungry, actually.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\n\n281\n00:14:09.699 --> 00:14:11.171\nwe're at 88%.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n282\n00:14:11.171 --> 00:14:12.605\n&gt;&gt; I don't think we can talk about\n\n283\n00:14:12.605 --> 00:14:14.103\nCheerios for another percent.\n\n284\n00:14:14.103 --> 00:14:15.660\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Probably not, but\n\n285\n00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:17.244\nit's gonna rapidly finish\nhere in just a second.\n\n286\n00:14:17.244 --> 00:14:21.201\nI'm sure it's gonna go, [NOISE] but I do\nlike the fact that they give me a progress\n\n287\n00:14:21.201 --> 00:14:22.989\nbar and not just a blinking cursor.\n\n288\n00:14:22.989 --> 00:14:24.779\nSo at least I know something-\n&gt;&gt; Is happening.\n\n289\n00:14:24.779 --> 00:14:25.493\n&gt;&gt; Is happening, right?\n\n290\n00:14:25.493 --> 00:14:27.477\nAll right, there we go, it finished.\n\n291\n00:14:27.477 --> 00:14:30.972\nSo now I'm gonna get another\nGet-ComputerRestorePoint.\n\n292\n00:14:30.972 --> 00:14:36.395\nAnd you'll see that I get a nice\nlist of restore points that I have.\n\n293\n00:14:36.395 --> 00:14:39.056\nCreationTime, there's my\nDescription that we put in.\n\n294\n00:14:39.056 --> 00:14:43.770\nSequenceNumber, this is what you're\ngonna need, actually, I take that back.\n\n295\n00:14:43.770 --> 00:14:47.855\nIt's not the SequenceNumber,\nthis is an internal number uses,\n\n296\n00:14:47.855 --> 00:14:51.805\nI think you might be able to point\nto a restore point using that.\n\n297\n00:14:51.805 --> 00:14:55.000\nBut typically,\nI'll show you here in just a second.\n\n298\n00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.859\nYou need the restore point id.\n\n299\n00:14:56.859 --> 00:14:58.730\nThere's that APPLICATION_INSTALL.\n\n300\n00:14:58.730 --> 00:15:05.974\nIn fact,\nlet's format this a table with what?\n\n301\n00:15:05.974 --> 00:15:10.176\n-wide and -auto.\n&gt;&gt; Just to get a better view?\n\n302\n00:15:10.176 --> 00:15:12.385\n&gt;&gt; See if I can get that to, or\n\n303\n00:15:12.385 --> 00:15:14.902\nget that command I was using.\n\n304\n00:15:14.902 --> 00:15:17.038\nLet's see, -auto.\n\n305\n00:15:17.038 --> 00:15:17.701\nSee if I can get it.\n\n306\n00:15:17.701 --> 00:15:18.523\nThere we go.\n\n307\n00:15:18.523 --> 00:15:21.101\nSo now you can kinda see everything.\n\n308\n00:15:21.101 --> 00:15:25.934\nThere's the APPLICATION_INSTALL that we\nchose as our, actually, we didn't choose\n\n309\n00:15:25.934 --> 00:15:29.025\na restore point to take that back.\n&gt;&gt; So, the default?\n\n310\n00:15:29.025 --> 00:15:29.759\n&gt;&gt; It defaults into application.\n\n311\n00:15:29.759 --> 00:15:30.643\n&gt;&gt; I was wondering, how do I remember\n\n312\n00:15:30.643 --> 00:15:31.404\nthat?\n&gt;&gt; Install,\n\n313\n00:15:31.404 --> 00:15:31.964\nyep.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n314\n00:15:31.964 --> 00:15:33.110\n&gt;&gt; Exactly right.\n\n315\n00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:36.901\nAll right, let's see, you could also\nformulate this out as a list and\n\n316\n00:15:36.901 --> 00:15:38.643\nget a little more information.\n\n317\n00:15:38.643 --> 00:15:40.181\nIf I do a little fl,\n\n318\n00:15:40.181 --> 00:15:45.880\nthere I can see a little more\ninformation about those restore points.\n\n319\n00:15:47.390 --> 00:15:54.173\nAll right, so I'm not seeing, interesting.\n&gt;&gt; The actual ID?\n\n320\n00:15:54.173 --> 00:15:55.788\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm not seeing the ID.\n\n321\n00:15:55.788 --> 00:15:57.460\n&gt;&gt; I just thought it was my vision.\n\n322\n00:15:57.460 --> 00:15:58.932\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I don't see it,\n\n323\n00:15:58.932 --> 00:16:00.854\nwhich is kind of interesting.\n\n324\n00:16:00.854 --> 00:16:05.078\nAll right, let's keep on trucking,\nso Get computer restore point.\n\n325\n00:16:05.078 --> 00:16:09.621\nLet's create, actually let's just do this.\n\n326\n00:16:09.621 --> 00:16:12.583\nWe will lead with that one and\nmake a lot of changes or anything.\n\n327\n00:16:12.583 --> 00:16:15.624\nBut again, this is really just to\nshow you the Powershell commands.\n\n328\n00:16:15.624 --> 00:16:19.999\nSo if you are familiar with those,\nif I wanted to roll back,\n\n329\n00:16:19.999 --> 00:16:26.290\nit's going to be restore dash computer and\nlet's see dash restore point.\n\n330\n00:16:26.290 --> 00:16:34.760\nI'm gonna try the sequence number 4,\nand lets see what it does.\n\n331\n00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:41.535\nShould go and start that process.\n\n332\n00:16:41.535 --> 00:16:46.577\nI know what it is, well nevermind,\nI'll show you something else.\n\n333\n00:16:46.577 --> 00:16:49.209\nI probably can't cancel this now\nthat it's started cuz remember,\n\n334\n00:16:49.209 --> 00:16:50.834\nyou can't cancel those restore points.\n\n335\n00:16:50.834 --> 00:16:55.800\nI was going to show you and I will if this\nactually starts to actually do my restore.\n\n336\n00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:58.740\nWe'll take a little time out,\nwe'll come back but give us just a second.\n\n337\n00:16:58.740 --> 00:17:03.610\nSo restore-computer -RetorePoint and\nthen that sequence number\n\n338\n00:17:03.610 --> 00:17:06.600\nis how you're going to identify the\nrestore point you want to roll back to.\n\n339\n00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:10.770\nSo you would look at that list, if it'll\nlet me scroll up while it's doing this,\n\n340\n00:17:10.770 --> 00:17:13.130\nand you might have several\nrestore points listed here.\n\n341\n00:17:13.130 --> 00:17:15.250\nYou're gonna look at that sequence number,\n\n342\n00:17:15.250 --> 00:17:18.320\nthat's how you're gonna indicate\nwhich one you wanna roll back to.\n\n343\n00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:23.001\nI was thinking of VSS Admin,\nis when you get the actual,\n\n344\n00:17:23.001 --> 00:17:28.790\nthis very long ID number, we'll take\na look at that in just a second.\n\n345\n00:17:28.790 --> 00:17:30.740\nSo we'll, we'll let this go for a minute.\n\n346\n00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:34.150\nSo anyway, where I was going with\nthat story in a roundabout way\n\n347\n00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:38.790\nis the restore dash computer,\ndash restore point, and then that\n\n348\n00:17:38.790 --> 00:17:42.840\nsequence number to begin that rollback\nprocess to that particular restore point.\n\n349\n00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:46.998\nWhat you can't do with powershell is\ndelete individual restore points but\n\n350\n00:17:46.998 --> 00:17:51.552\nyou can't do it in the gui either because\nwhen you go in there, there's the option\n\n351\n00:17:51.552 --> 00:17:55.776\nto delete all restore points, there's\nno way to do that with powershell and\n\n352\n00:17:55.776 --> 00:17:58.836\nthere's no way to delete\nindividual restore points.\n\n353\n00:17:58.836 --> 00:18:03.245\nHonestly, I don't think you would ever,\nand there you can see it's restarting, so\n\n354\n00:18:03.245 --> 00:18:05.730\nit was doing the system restore.\n\n355\n00:18:05.730 --> 00:18:07.460\nSo, we'll probably have to take a timeout.\n\n356\n00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:10.090\nGive me just one minute,\nAubrey, before you cut us off.\n\n357\n00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:12.400\nWhere was I going with that?\n\n358\n00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:15.035\nThere's no way to delete individual\nrestore points through PowerShell,\n\n359\n00:18:15.035 --> 00:18:15.675\nthrough the GUI.\n\n360\n00:18:15.675 --> 00:18:17.470\nI don't think you would\never have a need to.\n\n361\n00:18:17.470 --> 00:18:22.040\nI can't imagine thinking, I want to delete\nthat one restore point that I made.\n\n362\n00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:26.115\nTwo weeks ago on a Tuesday at 3 pm,\nbut not any of the other ones, right?\n\n363\n00:18:26.115 --> 00:18:30.186\nI can't see you ever needing to pick and\nchoose to delete certain restore points,\n\n364\n00:18:30.186 --> 00:18:33.077\nwhich is I'm assuming why they\ndon't have that command or\n\n365\n00:18:33.077 --> 00:18:35.038\nthat ability to really easily do that.\n\n366\n00:18:35.038 --> 00:18:39.938\nIf you did however, because restore points\nrely on Volume Shadow Copy service,\n\n367\n00:18:39.938 --> 00:18:44.045\nyou can use VSSadmin from the command\nline to work with those restore\n\n368\n00:18:44.045 --> 00:18:47.810\npoints because they are,\nthey do follow into that VSSadmin.\n\n369\n00:18:47.810 --> 00:18:52.466\nAnd when you run VSSadmin,\nyou can list your snapshots and\n\n370\n00:18:52.466 --> 00:18:56.085\nthen it gives you this big and\nlong ID number.\n\n371\n00:18:56.085 --> 00:19:01.148\nAnd then you can run a delete command and\npoint it to that particular restore point,\n\n372\n00:19:01.148 --> 00:19:06.278\nusing that sequence ID or that number that\nit assigns, but that will have to wait, so\n\n373\n00:19:06.278 --> 00:19:11.337\nwe will let this finish you can see it's\nat 24%, it should take it another four or\n\n374\n00:19:11.337 --> 00:19:16.410\nfive minutes at most, we'll come back and\nwe'll take a look at that VSS app.\n\n375\n00:19:16.410 --> 00:19:19.119\nAlright, so that finished restoring,\nlet's go ahead and\n\n376\n00:19:19.119 --> 00:19:24.280\nlog back in And\nobviously nothing really changed, right?\n\n377\n00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:26.470\nBecause we've just created\nthat restore point.\n\n378\n00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:29.770\nDidn't make any system changes and\nI probably shouldn't have applied it.\n\n379\n00:19:29.770 --> 00:19:31.120\nBut hey, it was fun.\n\n380\n00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:33.820\nYou got to see the PowerShell command for\nthat.\n\n381\n00:19:33.820 --> 00:19:36.830\nJust a couple of things\nleft to tidy up this topic.\n\n382\n00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:39.500\nAnd we have seen our,\n\n383\n00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:43.420\nthere is my message of my restore\npoint completed successfully.\n\n384\n00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:46.710\nSo let's take a look just\none more PowerShell command.\n\n385\n00:19:46.710 --> 00:19:49.580\nIt's really not a PowerShell command.\n\n386\n00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:51.960\nSorry.\nI clicked on something before Windows\n\n387\n00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:52.790\nwas ready.\n\n388\n00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:56.250\nAnd I probably want my\nadministrative PowerShell anyways.\n\n389\n00:19:56.250 --> 00:19:59.111\nSo let's close that and\ntry that one more time.\n\n390\n00:20:01.765 --> 00:20:03.502\nYou know how Windows [CROSSTALK]-\n&gt;&gt; It reminds you.\n\n391\n00:20:03.502 --> 00:20:07.170\nIt says you weren't patient so\nnow you have to deal with me.\n\n392\n00:20:07.170 --> 00:20:09.670\n&gt;&gt; It's funny how the boot process\n\n393\n00:20:09.670 --> 00:20:11.740\nis much, much faster than it ever was.\n\n394\n00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:13.330\nAnd that's mainly because you've\n\n395\n00:20:14.450 --> 00:20:17.450\nlet me get to my desktop before everything\nwas finished in the background.\n\n396\n00:20:17.450 --> 00:20:19.280\nIt's still doing some things.\n&gt;&gt; It has averted some of that?\n\n397\n00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:21.620\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but it make us feel good.\n\n398\n00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:23.590\nAll right, so\nhere I am back in PowerShell.\n\n399\n00:20:23.590 --> 00:20:27.750\nRemember that I wanna just check and\nsee if I still have some restore points.\n\n400\n00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:34.850\nSo get computerRestorePoint,\nsee if we have a couple there.\n\n401\n00:20:34.850 --> 00:20:37.360\nCuz remember,\nwhat we said towards the beginning\n\n402\n00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:42.240\nwas when you roll back to a restore point,\nanother restore point is created.\n\n403\n00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:43.590\nIn case that process fail.\n\n404\n00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:47.700\nSo you can see when I did the rollback, I\nonly had one to choose from, now there is\n\n405\n00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:53.140\na second restore point created,\nthe description was restore operation.\n\n406\n00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:57.414\nRestore point type is six,\nI'm not exactly sure what that is code for\n\n407\n00:20:57.414 --> 00:21:00.665\nbut that's an automatically\ncreated checkpoint.\n\n408\n00:21:00.665 --> 00:21:03.154\nAll right,\nthe last thing I wanted to show you,\n\n409\n00:21:03.154 --> 00:21:06.577\nhonestly this is probably not exam\nmaterial but I thought it would\n\n410\n00:21:06.577 --> 00:21:10.170\nround out our information,\non working with restore points.\n\n411\n00:21:10.170 --> 00:21:14.930\nAnd that's that vssadmin,\nbecause restore points leverage the volume\n\n412\n00:21:14.930 --> 00:21:18.950\nshadow copy service, we can use\nvssadmin to work with them as well.\n\n413\n00:21:18.950 --> 00:21:21.950\nSo I can do vssadmin list shadow.\n\n414\n00:21:23.650 --> 00:21:26.330\nAnd I lied to you,\nit's list shadows, plural.\n\n415\n00:21:28.010 --> 00:21:28.760\nAnd here.\n\n416\n00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:30.330\nThere's the command I just ran.\n\n417\n00:21:30.330 --> 00:21:31.670\nVia says admin.\n\n418\n00:21:31.670 --> 00:21:33.060\nList shadows.\n\n419\n00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:35.370\nAnd then here's the two snapshots.\n\n420\n00:21:35.370 --> 00:21:36.090\nOr I'm sorry.\n\n421\n00:21:36.090 --> 00:21:38.200\nCheck restore points that I have.\n\n422\n00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:38.990\nThere's the first one.\n\n423\n00:21:40.110 --> 00:21:40.670\nBut notice here.\n\n424\n00:21:40.670 --> 00:21:43.330\nIt doesn't call it doesn't number four and\nnumber five.\n\n425\n00:21:43.330 --> 00:21:46.440\nIt has a shadow copy ID.\n\n426\n00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:47.120\nAlright?\n\n427\n00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:54.736\nAnd that's what we would need to use\nif we were going to try to Remove and\n\n428\n00:21:54.736 --> 00:21:59.200\nindividual.\n&gt;&gt; Restore point.\n\n429\n00:21:59.200 --> 00:21:59.790\n&gt;&gt; Restore point.\n\n430\n00:21:59.790 --> 00:22:02.460\nSorry I can't.\n&gt;&gt; You almost had me saying checkpoint.\n\n431\n00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:04.760\nI was like.\nNo he said we can't say that.\n\n432\n00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:07.300\n&gt;&gt; Keep in mind that you can only do this.\n\n433\n00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:12.090\nYou can only remove them if they Have\nan attribute of client accessible.\n\n434\n00:22:12.090 --> 00:22:14.880\nVolume of shadow copy service does\nall the things in the background.\n\n435\n00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:20.260\nBut anything that we create should\nbe listed as client accessible, so\n\n436\n00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:21.550\nthose I can delete.\n\n437\n00:22:21.550 --> 00:22:25.960\nIf it doesn't say client accessible,\nI would not be able to delete that.\n\n438\n00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:31.458\nThe command, gosh this is gonna\ntest my memory VSS admin, delete,\n\n439\n00:22:31.458 --> 00:22:36.990\nshadow, shadow i-d let's\njust double check this.\n\n440\n00:22:36.990 --> 00:22:39.630\nLet's do a switch question mark.\n\n441\n00:22:39.630 --> 00:22:44.540\nAnd delete shadows there we go,\n\n442\n00:22:44.540 --> 00:22:48.710\nso let me clear that screen out.\n&gt;&gt; Sounds like a cool\n\n443\n00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:50.616\n&gt;&gt; Music title like a song title.\n\n444\n00:22:50.616 --> 00:22:53.100\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right?\n\n445\n00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:59.025\nDelete shadows and then it's shadowid=.\n\n446\n00:23:01.310 --> 00:23:04.110\nWhen I cleared my screen, silly me.\n\n447\n00:23:04.110 --> 00:23:06.720\nI definitely need that id\n&gt;&gt; The\n\n448\n00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:07.340\nlong one.\n&gt;&gt; yes.\n\n449\n00:23:07.340 --> 00:23:08.590\n&gt;&gt; I don't remember that's for sure.\n\n450\n00:23:08.590 --> 00:23:09.940\n&gt;&gt; Yeah let's do that again.\n\n451\n00:23:09.940 --> 00:23:14.530\nShadows, alright, and\nyou've had to be careful here and\n\n452\n00:23:14.530 --> 00:23:17.900\nI'm going to tell you this might not\nwork I've been playing around with this,\n\n453\n00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:22.910\nstudied up on docs on Microsoft dot com,\nwhat you should be able to do is grab\n\n454\n00:23:22.910 --> 00:23:28.030\nthis i-d here, alright,\nthe shadow copy i-d And delete it?\n\n455\n00:23:28.030 --> 00:23:28.940\nLet's see if that works.\n\n456\n00:23:28.940 --> 00:23:35.730\nI'm going to copy that ID, alright, and\nthen I'm going to do vssadmin delete\n\n457\n00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:43.540\nshadows switch shadow ID equals,\nand then I'm going to paste,\n\n458\n00:23:43.540 --> 00:23:48.270\nwith the curly braces, that ID.\n&gt;&gt; And this is what I kept getting.\n\n459\n00:23:49.750 --> 00:23:53.520\nIt's telling me that it's\nan invalid operation.\n\n460\n00:23:53.520 --> 00:24:00.610\nAnd you can see the syntax,\ndelete shadows, right, /shadow.\n\n461\n00:24:00.610 --> 00:24:04.840\nI put shadow ID, let's try that again.\n\n462\n00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:07.328\nLet me make sure,\nI did the syntax a little bit wrong here.\n\n463\n00:24:07.328 --> 00:24:13.500\nI'll say /shadow=.\n\n464\n00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:14.900\nAnd yeah, I get the same error.\n\n465\n00:24:16.580 --> 00:24:19.990\nSo even though this syntax is correct,\nright, Delete Shadows,\n\n466\n00:24:19.990 --> 00:24:26.690\nthis is what I'm using right here,\n/shadow equals shadow ID.\n\n467\n00:24:26.690 --> 00:24:29.160\nWhich is what I have here,\nand don’t seem to work.\n\n468\n00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:33.040\nNot sure of this is a little bit\nof a glitch, what’s going on,\n\n469\n00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:38.700\nthat is the syntax for it, I’m not sure\nwhy is not working, you can do all though.\n\n470\n00:24:39.770 --> 00:24:44.230\nI delete shadows, all\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n471\n00:24:44.230 --> 00:24:46.290\nthis is what you were talking about like\n&gt;&gt; Yes\n\n472\n00:24:46.290 --> 00:24:47.980\n&gt;&gt; Being able to delete all of them if\n\n473\n00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:52.030\nyou wanted to just no\n&gt;&gt; Restore point basis.\n\n474\n00:24:52.030 --> 00:24:53.920\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so you can see I did a y for\n\n475\n00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:55.430\nyes to delete all.\n\n476\n00:24:55.430 --> 00:24:59.880\nIf I do another list shadows,\nI don't have any shadows in the list.\n\n477\n00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:04.810\nSo VSS Admin is the tool you would use\nif you needed to delete an individual\n\n478\n00:25:06.430 --> 00:25:07.150\nrestore point.\n\n479\n00:25:08.350 --> 00:25:11.310\nThe syntax,\nit seems to be a little bit quirky here.\n\n480\n00:25:11.310 --> 00:25:13.810\nI'm not sure exactly, again,\nwhy it's not working.\n\n481\n00:25:13.810 --> 00:25:16.750\nBut just so you know,\nif they happen to ask you on the exam\n\n482\n00:25:16.750 --> 00:25:20.670\ncan you delete individual snapshots or\nrestore points?\n\n483\n00:25:20.670 --> 00:25:23.720\nAnd the only way to do\nthat is to use VSS Admin.\n\n484\n00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:29.260\nAnd it's just delete shadows slash\nshadow equals and then that shadow ID.\n\n485\n00:25:29.260 --> 00:25:31.700\nThat would be the proper\nsyntax why it's not working\n\n486\n00:25:31.700 --> 00:25:34.180\nnot sure may be they're\nremoving that feature.\n\n487\n00:25:34.180 --> 00:25:37.910\nI honestly, again I don't know that you\nwould ever really have a need to delete\n\n488\n00:25:37.910 --> 00:25:39.850\nindividual restore points.\n\n489\n00:25:39.850 --> 00:25:40.660\nBut just so\n\n490\n00:25:40.660 --> 00:25:44.160\nyou know that's how you would do it.\n&gt;&gt; All right Mike, thank you so much for\n\n491\n00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:46.970\ntaking the time to explain that for\nus here today.\n\n492\n00:25:46.970 --> 00:25:48.960\nI have a feeling you're\nnot quite finished yet.\n\n493\n00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:51.070\nSo I'm gonna have to ask\nyou to come back here for\n\n494\n00:25:51.070 --> 00:25:53.840\nanother part to our little mini series.\n\n495\n00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:55.250\nHow does that sound?\n&gt;&gt; Sounds like\n\n496\n00:25:55.250 --> 00:25:56.390\na plan to me.\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n497\n00:25:56.390 --> 00:25:57.030\nThank you so much.\n\n498\n00:25:57.030 --> 00:25:58.360\nLet's go ahead and sign out.\n\n499\n00:25:58.360 --> 00:25:59.150\nI've been your host.\n\n500\n00:25:59.150 --> 00:26:00.630\nCherokee Boose.\n&gt;&gt;

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:11.834 --> 00:00:15.874\n&gt;&gt; Welcome everyone to your\nconfiguring Windows devices series,\n\n4\n00:00:15.874 --> 00:00:18.500\nstudying up for that 70-697 exam.\n\n5\n00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.522\nI'm your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:20.522 --> 00:00:25.014\nIn this episode, we'll continue taking a\nlook at how to configure recovery options,\n\n7\n00:00:25.014 --> 00:00:28.660\nand of course, with us today back\nin studio we have Mr. Mike Rodrick.\n\n8\n00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:29.831\nHow is it going, Mike?\n\n9\n00:00:29.831 --> 00:00:34.005\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic, Cherokee, thanks for having\nme back in here, excited to continue on\n\n10\n00:00:34.005 --> 00:00:36.672\nwith our recovery options\n&gt;&gt; We got a few more to look at.\n\n11\n00:00:36.672 --> 00:00:39.957\nWe've already looked at things\nlike creating our recovery drive.\n\n12\n00:00:39.957 --> 00:00:44.837\nWe also looked at system restore points as\na way to try to get back to a known good\n\n13\n00:00:44.837 --> 00:00:45.824\npoint in time.\n\n14\n00:00:45.824 --> 00:00:50.363\nAnd the next thing I wanna talk about is\nthe Recovery Environment or Windows RE And\n\n15\n00:00:50.363 --> 00:00:54.836\nsome of the other options to help her with\nour PC if we're having trouble getting\n\n16\n00:00:54.836 --> 00:00:55.570\nit running or\n\n17\n00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:00.004\ngetting logged in or whatever now the case\nmaybe if we can't get it started up.\n\n18\n00:01:00.004 --> 00:01:03.359\nAnd we've actually already kind of seen\nthe recovery environment because one of\n\n19\n00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.790\nthe ways, we could work with\nour restore points, right?\n\n20\n00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.648\nIf we had a system that\ncouldn't boot successfully,\n\n21\n00:01:08.648 --> 00:01:12.587\nwe were able to use our recovery drive,\nwhich remember copied all of these\n\n22\n00:01:12.587 --> 00:01:16.719\nrecovery environment utilities over\nto that drive, and basically rebooted\n\n23\n00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:20.683\nthe computer to that thumb drive, and\nwe saw that recovery environment.\n\n24\n00:01:20.683 --> 00:01:23.384\nAnd in there,\nwas our system restore points, and\n\n25\n00:01:23.384 --> 00:01:25.581\nwe can try to go back to a previous point.\n\n26\n00:01:25.581 --> 00:01:28.759\nBut then I would just want to take a look\nat some of the other options that were\n\n27\n00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:30.786\navailable within that\nrecovery environment.\n\n28\n00:01:30.786 --> 00:01:33.474\n&gt;&gt; So Mike, this is kind of,\nI wouldn’t say a new feature,\n\n29\n00:01:33.474 --> 00:01:36.947\nbut it hasn’t always been around,\nthis recovery environment, right?\n\n30\n00:01:36.947 --> 00:01:38.351\n&gt;&gt; No, it’s kind of a,\n\n31\n00:01:38.351 --> 00:01:43.268\nwe’ve taken a lot of the utilities that\nwe used to use to troubleshoot PCs.\n\n32\n00:01:43.268 --> 00:01:48.178\nAnd they’ve put them in this recovery\nenvironment, this area, right,\n\n33\n00:01:48.178 --> 00:01:51.040\nand kind of a different\nway to access them.\n\n34\n00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:52.504\nBut a lot of these as you say.\n\n35\n00:01:52.504 --> 00:01:54.933\nA lot of these have been around for\na little while.\n\n36\n00:01:54.933 --> 00:01:58.841\nLike the ability to try\nto fix my startup issues.\n\n37\n00:01:58.841 --> 00:02:00.252\nThey've automated some of it.\n\n38\n00:02:00.252 --> 00:02:02.171\nAnd they've just updated the interface.\n\n39\n00:02:02.171 --> 00:02:04.162\nMade it a little easier to work with.\n\n40\n00:02:04.162 --> 00:02:07.332\nRather than booting back to maybe\na command prompt or something.\n\n41\n00:02:07.332 --> 00:02:09.013\nWe've got an interface we can deal with.\n\n42\n00:02:09.013 --> 00:02:12.061\nThe UI that we can click on or\ngraphical user interface.\n\n43\n00:02:12.061 --> 00:02:13.004\nSo let's take a look at it.\n\n44\n00:02:13.004 --> 00:02:15.941\nThere is a couple of ways we can\nget to that recovery environment.\n\n45\n00:02:15.941 --> 00:02:18.639\nI'm on my Windows 10 client here.\n\n46\n00:02:18.639 --> 00:02:20.321\nI'm gonna go over my start menu.\n\n47\n00:02:20.321 --> 00:02:25.289\nI'm simply gonna type in recovery,\nand we'll see my recovery options.\n\n48\n00:02:25.289 --> 00:02:27.343\nI also have creative recovery drive.\n\n49\n00:02:27.343 --> 00:02:31.440\nWe use that the other day, and recovery,\nwhich kind of take me to the same place.\n\n50\n00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.434\nSo we'll take a look at that in a minute.\n\n51\n00:02:33.434 --> 00:02:38.325\nSo I'll click on Recovery Options, and\nthat's gonna take me to my Settings and\n\n52\n00:02:38.325 --> 00:02:39.351\nthen Recovery.\n\n53\n00:02:39.351 --> 00:02:44.084\nSo I could have gotten here by going to\nmy Start Menu, clicking on my gear icon,\n\n54\n00:02:44.084 --> 00:02:49.063\nwhich brings me to my settings, and then\nchosen the recovery node just as easily.\n\n55\n00:02:49.063 --> 00:02:52.012\nYou see here we really don't have\na lot of choices here, right?\n\n56\n00:02:52.012 --> 00:02:52.682\nWe have two.\n\n57\n00:02:52.682 --> 00:02:57.174\nI've got Reset this PC and\nAdvanced startup.\n\n58\n00:02:57.174 --> 00:03:01.567\nSo Reset this PC, we'll talk about that\nfirst, we'll just kind of go down our\n\n59\n00:03:01.567 --> 00:03:05.982\npage here, tells me if your PC isn't\nrunning well, resetting it might help.\n\n60\n00:03:05.982 --> 00:03:08.212\nLets you choose to keep\nyour personal files.\n\n61\n00:03:08.212 --> 00:03:11.038\nOr remove them and\nthen reinstalls Windows.\n\n62\n00:03:11.038 --> 00:03:14.080\nWe're basically gonna do a reinstall\nof our operating system.\n\n63\n00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.018\nWe just have to decide,\ndo we wanna keep our personal files or\n\n64\n00:03:18.018 --> 00:03:20.194\ndo we wanna wipe everything out?\n\n65\n00:03:20.194 --> 00:03:23.332\nSo if Windows isn't running well,\nthis is an option.\n\n66\n00:03:23.332 --> 00:03:24.683\nIt's a little drastic.\n\n67\n00:03:24.683 --> 00:03:29.643\nYou might wanna try a restore point first\nor some other less intrusive method.\n\n68\n00:03:29.643 --> 00:03:31.332\nBut it's a good option to have.\n\n69\n00:03:31.332 --> 00:03:32.441\n&gt;&gt; I really like this one,\n\n70\n00:03:32.441 --> 00:03:35.504\nbecause this was one of those\nthings that wasn't always around.\n\n71\n00:03:35.504 --> 00:03:38.983\nSo you would had have\nto used backup disks.\n\n72\n00:03:38.983 --> 00:03:43.706\nOr if you had, even going way back, the\nactual installation media that Microsoft\n\n73\n00:03:43.706 --> 00:03:47.411\nmay have shipped to you for\nthat initial installation there so.\n\n74\n00:03:47.411 --> 00:03:51.288\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly, I mean, how many times\nhave you had to reinstall an operating\n\n75\n00:03:51.288 --> 00:03:54.901\nsystem because it was having problems,\nsomething had gotten corrupt.\n\n76\n00:03:54.901 --> 00:03:58.042\nSo you had to first try to\nremember to copy everything off.\n\n77\n00:03:58.042 --> 00:04:01.431\nI hope you didn't forget anything or\nhave a current backup.\n\n78\n00:04:01.431 --> 00:04:06.213\nAnd then break out your install media,\nreinstall, go get all your drivers again.\n\n79\n00:04:06.213 --> 00:04:09.492\nAll of that stuff, get your updates.\n\n80\n00:04:09.492 --> 00:04:13.212\nThis is a one-click option where\nI don't have to do all of that.\n\n81\n00:04:13.212 --> 00:04:16.172\nI could accomplish the same thing,\nbut in a much easier way.\n\n82\n00:04:16.172 --> 00:04:21.934\nIf I click Get Started, I'm gonna get a\nlittle dialogue that gives me two options,\n\n83\n00:04:21.934 --> 00:04:24.502\nkeep my files or remove everything.\n\n84\n00:04:24.502 --> 00:04:25.915\nIt's pretty straightforward, right?\n\n85\n00:04:25.915 --> 00:04:29.094\nIt removes apps and settings,\nbut keeps your personal files.\n\n86\n00:04:29.094 --> 00:04:32.241\nThe second one removes all your\npersonal files, apps, and settings.\n\n87\n00:04:32.241 --> 00:04:36.219\nSo do I want to, if I have things\nin my documents, my pictures,\n\n88\n00:04:36.219 --> 00:04:38.482\nthings like that are my favorites.\n\n89\n00:04:38.482 --> 00:04:41.963\nAll of that will stay if I\nchoose to keep my files.\n\n90\n00:04:41.963 --> 00:04:45.211\nFor the exam, the important thing to\nunderstand here is one, the two options.\n\n91\n00:04:45.211 --> 00:04:46.952\nEither keep my files or don't.\n\n92\n00:04:46.952 --> 00:04:51.323\nThose also that both of them say\nremove apps and settings, right?\n\n93\n00:04:51.323 --> 00:04:55.768\nSo even with the keep my files,\nit will remove applications or\n\n94\n00:04:55.768 --> 00:04:59.023\nyour Windows Store apps and\nthose settings.\n\n95\n00:04:59.023 --> 00:05:00.541\nFrom your Windows 10 installation.\n\n96\n00:05:00.541 --> 00:05:03.415\nAgain, you're reinstalling\nthe operating system.\n\n97\n00:05:03.415 --> 00:05:07.346\nWhereas, the other one include your\npersonal files but both will remove apps.\n\n98\n00:05:07.346 --> 00:05:10.335\nSo you're gonna have to reinstall any\nof their or download them again and\n\n99\n00:05:10.335 --> 00:05:11.322\nreinstall those apps.\n\n100\n00:05:11.322 --> 00:05:15.250\nThat actually gonna launch this because I\nwanna use this PC for other things, but\n\n101\n00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:16.519\nthere's not a lot to see,\n\n102\n00:05:16.519 --> 00:05:19.552\nonce you start this process,\nyou walk away from the machine.\n\n103\n00:05:19.552 --> 00:05:22.939\nYou come back in a little while and\nit has reinstalled Windows 10.\n\n104\n00:05:22.939 --> 00:05:26.213\nEither with or without your files,\ndepending on which option you chose.\n\n105\n00:05:26.213 --> 00:05:28.560\nWe'll go ahead and cancel out of that.\n\n106\n00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.142\nAnd that has changed a little bit, right?\n\n107\n00:05:30.142 --> 00:05:34.429\nIf we go back even to a couple\nof versions ago of Windows 10,\n\n108\n00:05:34.429 --> 00:05:37.802\nit was known as reset and\nwhat was the other one?\n\n109\n00:05:37.802 --> 00:05:38.893\nRefresh, I think.\n\n110\n00:05:38.893 --> 00:05:39.603\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.\n\n111\n00:05:39.603 --> 00:05:42.002\n&gt;&gt; They differentiated there.\n\n112\n00:05:42.002 --> 00:05:45.856\nNow again, and for this exam,\nit's just reset your PC, and\n\n113\n00:05:45.856 --> 00:05:48.133\nthen either keep your files or not.\n\n114\n00:05:48.133 --> 00:05:50.061\nAnd that's good, I think-\n&gt;&gt; A little more simplified, right?\n\n115\n00:05:50.061 --> 00:05:53.051\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nthe terminology was a little weird before.\n\n116\n00:05:53.051 --> 00:05:56.262\nYou had, wait, which one is reset and\nwhich one is refresh?\n\n117\n00:05:56.262 --> 00:05:59.034\nOne of them keeps my files,\none of them doesn't.\n\n118\n00:05:59.034 --> 00:06:02.943\nAnd it was very confusing, and I think it\nwas easy to make the wrong choice there.\n\n119\n00:06:02.943 --> 00:06:05.633\nSo this is a lot easier in my opinion.\n\n120\n00:06:05.633 --> 00:06:08.500\nAnd then, below that,\nI've got my Advanced Startup.\n\n121\n00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:13.141\nThis is what we saw, this is what we would\nboot it into basically when we were using\n\n122\n00:06:13.141 --> 00:06:14.387\nour recovery drive.\n\n123\n00:06:14.387 --> 00:06:20.849\nYou see it says Startup from a disc or\ndevice like USB or DVD.\n\n124\n00:06:20.849 --> 00:06:24.600\nChange your PC's firmware settings,\nWindows startup settings, or\n\n125\n00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:26.641\nrestore Windows from a system image.\n\n126\n00:06:26.641 --> 00:06:31.655\nThis will restart your PC and\nnotice the button does say Restart now.\n\n127\n00:06:31.655 --> 00:06:35.468\nAnd this is what we used to get to with\nout, what was it, F8 on most systems?\n\n128\n00:06:35.468 --> 00:06:38.060\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Where you get that boot menu so\n\n129\n00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:42.642\n[CROSSTALK] USB drive to boot to or\nsomething like your F12.\n\n130\n00:06:42.642 --> 00:06:46.296\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, like if you wanted to boot into\na safe mode or any kind of restricted,\n\n131\n00:06:46.296 --> 00:06:48.332\njust for troubleshooting, basically.\n\n132\n00:06:48.332 --> 00:06:50.894\n&gt;&gt; Yep, this is how we're gonna\nget to those options now.\n\n133\n00:06:50.894 --> 00:06:54.170\nSo let's go ahead, I'm gonna go ahead and\nclick it, choose restart now so\n\n134\n00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:55.785\nI could take terribly long.\n\n135\n00:06:55.785 --> 00:06:59.801\nWhat it's gonna do is it's gonna reboot\nbut instead of starting normally,\n\n136\n00:06:59.801 --> 00:07:03.643\nit's gonna take me into my recovery\nenvironment, here we can see that.\n\n137\n00:07:03.643 --> 00:07:07.400\nAnd the choices again, I know we've seen\nthis before, but let's go over them again,\n\n138\n00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:09.422\ncontinue, existing continuing to Windows.\n\n139\n00:07:09.422 --> 00:07:10.889\nMaybe I hit this by a mistake,\n\n140\n00:07:10.889 --> 00:07:14.770\nwe're just playing around or experimenting\nwanted to see what happened, and\n\n141\n00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:18.002\nI decided everything is fine like\nan exit and continue to window,\n\n142\n00:07:18.002 --> 00:07:21.512\nso I'll just boot normally,\ntaking you back to my operating system.\n\n143\n00:07:21.512 --> 00:07:26.362\nUse a device, this is going\nto give me the old ability to\n\n144\n00:07:26.362 --> 00:07:30.274\nboot to like a USB or\na Windows Recovery DVD.\n\n145\n00:07:30.274 --> 00:07:34.124\nAnd then troubleshoot, we'll click\non that one in just a second, and\n\n146\n00:07:34.124 --> 00:07:35.373\nthen turn off your PC.\n\n147\n00:07:35.373 --> 00:07:38.602\nNice, I guess they gave me a power option\nhere just to go ahead and power down.\n\n148\n00:07:38.602 --> 00:07:40.104\nI give up, I don't wanna do it anymore.\n\n149\n00:07:40.104 --> 00:07:41.721\nLet's just turn it off.\n\n150\n00:07:41.721 --> 00:07:44.804\nAll right, if I choose use a device,\n\n151\n00:07:44.804 --> 00:07:48.996\nit gives me a list of\nthe devices that I can boot to.\n\n152\n00:07:48.996 --> 00:07:52.785\nI don't really have anything in here,\nso I'm not gonna choose any of these.\n\n153\n00:07:52.785 --> 00:07:56.106\nThat's how if I had a thumb drive\nplugged in and it was bootable,\n\n154\n00:07:56.106 --> 00:07:59.133\nI could pick it from this list or\na DVD if I had that in there.\n\n155\n00:07:59.133 --> 00:08:01.191\nI could go ahead and\ntell it to boot to that.\n\n156\n00:08:01.191 --> 00:08:04.061\nAnd boot my system to that external media.\n\n157\n00:08:04.061 --> 00:08:07.233\nBelow that we got our troubleshoot and\nthis is typically where\n\n158\n00:08:07.233 --> 00:08:11.140\nwe're going when we're getting into\nthis recovery environment, right.\n\n159\n00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:15.130\nSomething is wrong so I've told it to\nuse my advance startup options and\n\n160\n00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:19.870\nthen will either boot to media or\nuse our troubleshooting options here.\n\n161\n00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:23.090\nAnd in troubleshooting\nI have reset this PC.\n\n162\n00:08:23.090 --> 00:08:24.690\nAnd advanced options.\n\n163\n00:08:24.690 --> 00:08:27.920\nReset this PC is just like the one-\n&gt;&gt; Takes us back.\n\n164\n00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:30.110\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it's the same options, right?\n\n165\n00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:32.020\nA little different interface, but\n\n166\n00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:36.940\nmaybe I couldn't get to that through my\nsettings or whatever the case may be.\n\n167\n00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:38.980\nSo you get the same options here.\n\n168\n00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:43.250\nI can keep my files,\nit still removes absent settings, right?\n\n169\n00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:44.570\nBut keeps all my personal files.\n\n170\n00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:47.680\nOr I can remove everything and reinstall.\n\n171\n00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:49.970\nLet's go back.\n\n172\n00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:52.460\nAnd then the other one\nwas my Advanced options.\n\n173\n00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:54.440\nAnd if we click the Advanced options,\n\n174\n00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:56.990\nthis is where we ended up\nagain in that other show.\n\n175\n00:08:56.990 --> 00:08:58.642\nHow we could work with System Restore.\n\n176\n00:08:58.642 --> 00:09:03.390\nSo if I couldn't boot my system,\nright, to get into my graphic Azure\n\n177\n00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:07.080\nphase to work with my restore points,\nI can use this boot method,\n\n178\n00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:11.270\nI can boot up to my advanced options,\ncome in here and choose system restore.\n\n179\n00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:13.330\nAnd if I click this,\nlet's go ahead and click it,\n\n180\n00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:18.430\nI can't remember if I actually have any\nrestore points left on this machine.\n\n181\n00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:21.950\nI know we were playing around with some of\nour delete options in a previous episode.\n\n182\n00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:23.590\nLet's see what happens.\n\n183\n00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:27.280\nAnd you can kill the screen share,\nI'll tell you when it comes back up,\n\n184\n00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:28.690\nif you wanna share that\nblack screen there.\n\n185\n00:09:29.770 --> 00:09:34.100\nIt's booting up the system and it's gonna\nallow me to see, though it's gonna give me\n\n186\n00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:38.930\na little a dialog box, and I'll see\nthe existing restore points that I have.\n\n187\n00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:41.270\nI should be able to pick from those.\n\n188\n00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:45.830\nSo it's currently rebooting,\nso just another way, again,\n\n189\n00:09:45.830 --> 00:09:49.820\njust trying to get back into those restore\npoints to be able to try to restore,\n\n190\n00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:53.590\nroll that system back to\na known good point in time.\n\n191\n00:09:53.590 --> 00:09:57.160\nMaybe I installed an application\nthat's caused a problem and\n\n192\n00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:58.940\nI can no longer boot the system.\n\n193\n00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:01.810\nI know I've got a restore point that I\ncreated right before I installed that\n\n194\n00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:05.830\napplication, but now I can't get to\nit because I can't boot the system.\n\n195\n00:10:05.830 --> 00:10:07.030\nSo this is how you do that.\n\n196\n00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:10.020\nYou could use your recovery\ndrive that you created.\n\n197\n00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:12.120\nBoot into those advanced options and\nchoose this.\n\n198\n00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:14.130\nAll right,\nlet's take a look at my screen here.\n\n199\n00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:17.240\nIn order to do a restore,\nyou are going to need to authenticate,\n\n200\n00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:18.670\nwhich is a good thing, right?\n\n201\n00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:19.170\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n[LAUGH]\n\n202\n00:10:19.170 --> 00:10:20.010\n&gt;&gt; I don't want Cherokee\n\n203\n00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:24.530\nwalking up to my machine and rebooting it,\nand choosing to do a System Restore.\n\n204\n00:10:24.530 --> 00:10:26.660\nAnd wipe out all his files or\nin this case,\n\n205\n00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:31.670\nroll back to a point in time or\nsomebody that shouldn't be doing this.\n\n206\n00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:37.163\nI'm going to choose my account here and\nI'll have to put in my password.\n\n207\n00:10:37.163 --> 00:10:41.700\n{CLICKING SOUNDS] And\nhopefully I typed the right password.\n\n208\n00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:45.340\nAnd there we can see our system restore.\n\n209\n00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:49.480\nSo this point is no different than what\nwe would have done within Windows.\n\n210\n00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:51.910\nIt brings up my system restore.\n\n211\n00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:53.290\nI'll click Next.\n\n212\n00:10:53.290 --> 00:10:55.810\nI get the list of restore points.\n\n213\n00:10:55.810 --> 00:10:59.750\nAnd once I select a particular restore\npoint, I can do the whole scan for\n\n214\n00:10:59.750 --> 00:11:02.665\naffected programs like we\nsaw in a previous episode.\n\n215\n00:11:02.665 --> 00:11:06.950\nIt'll show me what programs\nare gonna be removed completely and\n\n216\n00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:14.350\nwhat programs might need to be reinstalled\nonce the restore point is rolled back to.\n\n217\n00:11:14.350 --> 00:11:17.290\nIf I click 'next' of course this\nwould go through that process.\n\n218\n00:11:17.290 --> 00:11:18.200\nI'm not going to do that.\n\n219\n00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:19.675\nWe've seen that before.\n\n220\n00:11:19.675 --> 00:11:21.830\nWe'll go take a look at\nthe rest of our options.\n\n221\n00:11:22.842 --> 00:11:26.080\nAll right, so back into troubleshoot and\nadvanced options.\n\n222\n00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:29.810\nSo that was system restore, just another\nway to get into those restore points.\n\n223\n00:11:29.810 --> 00:11:31.840\nSystem image recovery.\n\n224\n00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:36.710\nRecover windows using\na specific system image file.\n\n225\n00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:39.104\nSo I select that.\n\n226\n00:11:39.104 --> 00:11:41.870\nYou’ll see that it tells me,\nI can’t find the system image.\n\n227\n00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:43.260\nI haven’t created one.\n\n228\n00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:45.020\nWe’ll talk about where I\ncan go to to create this.\n\n229\n00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:47.800\nBut that is another kind of\nlike restore points, right,\n\n230\n00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:49.120\nwhere you have to be proactive.\n\n231\n00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:50.530\nWe can’t be reactive.\n\n232\n00:11:50.530 --> 00:11:54.410\nI can’t make a system image now,\nif my system is already messed up.\n\n233\n00:11:54.410 --> 00:11:57.840\nAnd I'm in these recovery options\ntrying to fix things, it's too late.\n\n234\n00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:00.760\nI would need to create that system image\nahead of time while everything was\n\n235\n00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:05.370\nworking well, so\nthat I have that to rollback to, right?\n\n236\n00:12:05.370 --> 00:12:10.430\nAll right, so I'll cancel out that,\nbut if I had an image, I could go and\n\n237\n00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:14.360\nbrowse, it'll pull the latest\none if I have multiples.\n\n238\n00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:15.850\nOr I can select a system image.\n\n239\n00:12:15.850 --> 00:12:19.610\nI don't have any, so\nI'm gonna cancel out of that, all right?\n\n240\n00:12:19.610 --> 00:12:23.350\nOur system image, now are basically\na backup, right, of our system,\n\n241\n00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:26.750\nall of the drives that\nare required to run Windows would\n\n242\n00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:27.830\nbe part of that system image.\n\n243\n00:12:27.830 --> 00:12:30.180\nYou can include additional\ndrives if you want to, but\n\n244\n00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:31.680\nyou're just reapplying that image.\n\n245\n00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:34.940\nSo, going bad.\n\n246\n00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:37.130\nIn this case you would lose data,\n\n247\n00:12:37.130 --> 00:12:40.210\nand that's one of those things we've\ngot to think about for the exam.\n\n248\n00:12:40.210 --> 00:12:42.830\nIf they ask you a question,\nyou need to fix this system but\n\n249\n00:12:42.830 --> 00:12:46.480\nyou can't lose any data,\nwhich option would you choose?\n\n250\n00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:49.620\nWell, a system image is not going to\nbe the appropriate option because that\n\n251\n00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:51.950\nis going to cause you to lose data.\n\n252\n00:12:51.950 --> 00:12:56.000\nAll right, so usually on questions\nlike that they're gonna ask you,\n\n253\n00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.110\nwhich method would you use if you're\nokay with losing all your data?\n\n254\n00:12:59.110 --> 00:13:02.020\nAnd then you have to know\nthe appropriate method.\n\n255\n00:13:02.020 --> 00:13:05.210\nAll right, so back into troubleshoot and\nadvanced options one more time.\n\n256\n00:13:05.210 --> 00:13:08.650\nThat was System Image Recovery,\nI also have Startup Repair.\n\n257\n00:13:08.650 --> 00:13:13.110\nSo if it's just a problem with\nWindows starting up, I click that and\n\n258\n00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:14.750\nit's gonna go into this diagnostics mode.\n\n259\n00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:16.626\nIt's gonna look at my startup files, and\n\n260\n00:13:16.626 --> 00:13:18.727\nit's gonna see if it can\nfind anything wrong.\n\n261\n00:13:18.727 --> 00:13:23.034\nAnd if it does, if it finds a file\nthat's corrupt or having a problem,\n\n262\n00:13:23.034 --> 00:13:27.560\nit can actually copy a new set of those\nover from that recovery partition,\n\n263\n00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:29.840\nreplace those system files.\n\n264\n00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:32.408\nSo you hear Startup Repair\ncouldn't repair your PC.\n\n265\n00:13:32.408 --> 00:13:34.680\nWell, that's good,\nbecause I didn't have any problems.\n\n266\n00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:39.370\nSo you can press Advanced Options to\ntry other options or repair your PC, or\n\n267\n00:13:39.370 --> 00:13:40.970\nshut down to turn it off.\n\n268\n00:13:40.970 --> 00:13:42.760\nAnd it does make a log file.\n\n269\n00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:46.530\nSo buried in the system\n32 folder log files.\n\n270\n00:13:46.530 --> 00:13:47.470\nI know that's really small,\n\n271\n00:13:47.470 --> 00:13:51.610\nI can't zoom in on this particular screen\nbecause I'm not into my operating system.\n\n272\n00:13:51.610 --> 00:13:57.991\nBut it says logfiles/srt/srt trail.txt.\n\n273\n00:13:57.991 --> 00:14:02.250\nI don't think they'd ask you that\nspecific of a question on the exam.\n\n274\n00:14:02.250 --> 00:14:04.130\nBut there is a log file that's generated.\n\n275\n00:14:04.130 --> 00:14:08.055\nSo you can go in and see what it\ntried to do if it fixed anything.\n\n276\n00:14:08.055 --> 00:14:11.524\nAll right, I'm going to click advanced\noptions which should take me right back\n\n277\n00:14:11.524 --> 00:14:13.075\nout to where we were.\n\n278\n00:14:13.075 --> 00:14:14.735\nBut it's kind of nice that hey,\n\n279\n00:14:14.735 --> 00:14:19.705\nWindows attempted to fix itself without\nme really having to do anything.\n\n280\n00:14:19.705 --> 00:14:23.685\nI wasn't going in there and\ntyping fix boot or anything like that.\n\n281\n00:14:23.685 --> 00:14:26.685\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly what I was thinking\nbecause I saw on the list we have command\n\n282\n00:14:26.685 --> 00:14:31.890\nprompt coming up next and utilities\nlike bootrec.exe or something like that.\n\n283\n00:14:31.890 --> 00:14:34.310\nWe don't remember all those,\nthat might be pretty handy.\n\n284\n00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:38.880\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it is, I would much rather let\nWindows fix itself than to me go through\n\n285\n00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:43.250\nthe trouble of doing that all manually,\nif it can, right?\n\n286\n00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:46.066\nAll right, so\nwe'll go back into our advanced options,\n\n287\n00:14:46.066 --> 00:14:47.800\nthat would start up repair.\n\n288\n00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:52.640\nUEFI, I'll come back to command prompt,\nUEFI Firmware Settings I choose this.\n\n289\n00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:56.925\nI'm gonna have to restart\nto change my UEFI firmware,\n\n290\n00:14:56.925 --> 00:15:00.885\nU-E-F-I if I slow down I can\nactually say that correctly, right?\n\n291\n00:15:00.885 --> 00:15:03.646\n[COUGH] Excuse me.\n\n292\n00:15:03.646 --> 00:15:04.790\nSo we'll let this reboot.\n\n293\n00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:06.510\nAgain you can kill the screen share for\njust a second,\n\n294\n00:15:06.510 --> 00:15:08.150\nI'll let you know when it comes back up.\n\n295\n00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:12.930\nBut it's going into my UEFI,\nthere we go, we can take a look at this.\n\n296\n00:15:12.930 --> 00:15:16.310\nWe've seen this before, right,\nwhen I went and did my F12 to\n\n297\n00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:20.892\nchoose to boot to my recovery drive\nthat we created in a previous episode.\n\n298\n00:15:20.892 --> 00:15:27.560\nHere I could work with, I could jump\ninto setup, I could reset the system,\n\n299\n00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:32.430\nI can pick something else to\nboot to Setup would then take\n\n300\n00:15:32.430 --> 00:15:37.360\nme into where I can configure my boot\noptions, configure my drivers, or\n\n301\n00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:42.550\nboot from a file, screen size,\nand then of course, I can exit.\n\n302\n00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:46.500\nI'm not gonna change any settings here cuz\nmy machine is working fine right now, but\n\n303\n00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:48.750\nwe need to understand\nwhere these options are.\n\n304\n00:15:48.750 --> 00:15:50.530\nSo I'm gonna exit\nthe Boot Maintenance Manager.\n\n305\n00:15:51.890 --> 00:15:57.201\nAnd I will exit out of this.\n\n306\n00:15:59.719 --> 00:16:01.590\nWe're just gonna say boot normally.\n\n307\n00:16:02.970 --> 00:16:04.601\nTo get back into here.\n\n308\n00:16:04.601 --> 00:16:09.069\nAnd now I'm actually gonna go back into\nWindows cuz this is just like if you had\n\n309\n00:16:09.069 --> 00:16:14.190\ndone your F12 and got into your settings\nto adjust some of those UFI settings.\n\n310\n00:16:14.190 --> 00:16:17.840\nNow, it's actually going to boot Windows\nnormally so I'll have to wait until it\n\n311\n00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:22.420\nboots and then we can get back\ninto Those recovery options.\n\n312\n00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:23.960\nSo we still want to\nlook at command prompt.\n\n313\n00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:25.390\nThere is not a lot to see there.\n\n314\n00:16:25.390 --> 00:16:26.840\nIt's just a command prompt.\n\n315\n00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:28.610\nWe'll take a look at it in second though.\n\n316\n00:16:28.610 --> 00:16:32.230\nBut it does give me access to some of\nthose commands that I might try to use\n\n317\n00:16:32.230 --> 00:16:34.000\nto fix my system.\n\n318\n00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.270\nI wanna say,\nlet see where this boots up there.\n\n319\n00:16:37.270 --> 00:16:41.980\nIf I get to the my log on screen here,\nwe'll give it just one more second.\n\n320\n00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:45.940\nWatching those spinning\nCheerios go around.\n\n321\n00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:46.944\nThere we go.\n\n322\n00:16:46.944 --> 00:16:48.010\nWe can take a look at my screen.\n\n323\n00:16:48.010 --> 00:16:51.980\nI did want to show you while I'm here\nactually this will give me a good option\n\n324\n00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:57.430\nto show you that you can Shift click\non your power button over here and\n\n325\n00:16:57.430 --> 00:16:58.520\nchoose Restart.\n\n326\n00:17:00.130 --> 00:17:04.020\nIt should,\nwe'll find out if that actually works.\n\n327\n00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:08.540\nThey've added a couple of new methods\nto get into those recovery options.\n\n328\n00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:10.980\nHolding down Shift while you\nclick that Power button and\n\n329\n00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:14.240\nchoosing Restart, is supposed to\nget me into those recovery options.\n\n330\n00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:16.300\nIt's a method that I\nactually haven't used.\n\n331\n00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:20.124\n&gt;&gt; I've used it inside of\nthe actual ones like the desktop is\n\n332\n00:17:20.124 --> 00:17:22.760\nalready pulled up from the Start Menu.\n\n333\n00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:24.960\nIt works, but I don't think I've\ntried it this way either, so.\n\n334\n00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:26.430\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, supposedly from the Start screen.\n\n335\n00:17:26.430 --> 00:17:28.460\nSo I thought I'd test that live,\nright here on the show.\n\n336\n00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:29.216\n&gt;&gt; Always a great idea.\n\n337\n00:17:29.216 --> 00:17:30.437\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.\n\n338\n00:17:30.437 --> 00:17:31.252\nWhy not, right?\n\n339\n00:17:31.252 --> 00:17:34.320\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You can also get there by,\n\n340\n00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:39.467\nthey will shut that command from\ncommand prompt or PowerShell,\n\n341\n00:17:39.467 --> 00:17:45.298\nyou can do shut down or /r to restart and\nthen /o, the letter O not zero.\n\n342\n00:17:45.298 --> 00:17:47.204\nAnd that gets you in your boot options,\nright?\n\n343\n00:17:47.204 --> 00:17:48.301\n&gt;&gt; That's pretty cool.\n&gt;&gt; Like O for options.\n\n344\n00:17:48.301 --> 00:17:49.560\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n345\n00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:52.131\n&gt;&gt; Obviously it only works with the /r.\n\n346\n00:17:52.131 --> 00:17:54.608\nYou do a /o with a shut down.\n\n347\n00:17:54.608 --> 00:17:55.379\n&gt;&gt; That's just gonna shut down.\n\n348\n00:17:55.379 --> 00:17:56.068\n&gt;&gt; Well, you're gonna shutdown.\n\n349\n00:17:56.068 --> 00:17:57.676\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You're not gonna get into those\n\n350\n00:17:57.676 --> 00:17:58.410\nrecovery options.\n\n351\n00:17:58.410 --> 00:18:03.020\nSo the /o will work with a /r option.\n\n352\n00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:05.090\n&gt;&gt; Moment of truth here.\n\n353\n00:18:05.090 --> 00:18:06.590\n&gt;&gt; So\nyeah let's see it doesn't look like it.\n\n354\n00:18:06.590 --> 00:18:08.308\nIt looks to me like it's\ngonna boot normally.\n\n355\n00:18:08.308 --> 00:18:13.580\nAnd it did so,\nwe'll have to table that one.\n\n356\n00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:17.550\nI'll go ahead and log back in.\n\n357\n00:18:17.550 --> 00:18:19.370\n[COUGH] Excuse me.\n\n358\n00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:24.380\nSo, get logged back in and I also want to.\n\n359\n00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:25.520\nLet's do this.\n\n360\n00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:29.500\nAs Cherokee was saying,\nif I hold down Shift and\n\n361\n00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:34.552\nchose Restart from here, it should\ngive me into my boot options as well.\n\n362\n00:18:34.552 --> 00:18:38.400\nI'm not gonna do cuz I think we\nhave seen reboot option a couple\n\n363\n00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:40.420\nof times may be too many.\n\n364\n00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:45.707\nSo what I'm gonna do is go to my gear,\nmy Settings Wait for\n\n365\n00:18:45.707 --> 00:18:48.756\nthat and then back in to Update and\nSecurity.\n\n366\n00:18:51.841 --> 00:18:53.267\n&gt;&gt; Let's get to navigate-\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]\n\n367\n00:18:53.267 --> 00:18:55.328\n&gt;&gt; Through there, because I can,\n\n368\n00:18:55.328 --> 00:18:58.379\nwith this new,\nthat grid settings interface,\n\n369\n00:18:58.379 --> 00:19:03.450\nI'm slow to remember because I'm so\nused to the control panel categories.\n\n370\n00:19:03.450 --> 00:19:05.981\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; And my brain is kind of wired that way.\n\n371\n00:19:05.981 --> 00:19:09.149\n&gt;&gt; It does take a little getting used to,\nand especially when the control panel is\n\n372\n00:19:09.149 --> 00:19:11.933\nstill there and some things are not\navailable in the new interface and\n\n373\n00:19:11.933 --> 00:19:14.150\nyou have to go through the old-\n&gt;&gt; Fall back on that.\n\n374\n00:19:14.150 --> 00:19:16.160\n&gt;&gt; Control Panel, exactly.\n\n375\n00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:20.900\nSo let me click Troubleshoot to get\nus back into our Advanced Options.\n\n376\n00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:22.470\nWe've seen all of this.\n\n377\n00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:25.880\nThe Startup Settings, we click on that.\n\n378\n00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:30.030\nThis is basically the old-school F8,\nright, where I wanted to get into safe\n\n379\n00:19:30.030 --> 00:19:35.730\nmode or safe mode with login or\ndebugging or low res mode.\n\n380\n00:19:35.730 --> 00:19:37.740\nIt's also where we've seen\nthis in other episodes.\n\n381\n00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:40.530\nWhere I can do the disabling,\n\n382\n00:19:40.530 --> 00:19:43.830\ntemporarily disabling the driver\nsignature requirement.\n\n383\n00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:46.390\nI needed to do and\ninstall a driver that was not signed.\n\n384\n00:19:46.390 --> 00:19:47.550\nMaybe developed in house.\n\n385\n00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:50.270\nThis is how it get that.\n\n386\n00:19:50.270 --> 00:19:51.340\nJust click Restart.\n\n387\n00:19:53.170 --> 00:19:57.862\nAnd then, again, this is gonna be a lot\nlike you'll see this looks a lot like what\n\n388\n00:19:57.862 --> 00:20:01.933\nwe just saw when we used to hit F8 on\nour older operating systems during\n\n389\n00:20:01.933 --> 00:20:03.112\nthat boot process.\n\n390\n00:20:03.112 --> 00:20:05.937\nBut now I don't have to,\nand I think, Cherokee,\n\n391\n00:20:05.937 --> 00:20:09.449\nyou hinted at this in some of your shows,\nand maybe in 698.\n\n392\n00:20:09.449 --> 00:20:14.303\nWe're talking about the fact that the boot\nprocess is pretty quick with Windows and\n\n393\n00:20:14.303 --> 00:20:18.551\nit can be tricky to hit some of those\nkeystrokes during the boot process.\n\n394\n00:20:18.551 --> 00:20:21.964\nAt the right time to get into those\nmenus and it's frustrating, right?\n\n395\n00:20:21.964 --> 00:20:23.984\nCuz you're like, it's booting normally.\n\n396\n00:20:23.984 --> 00:20:24.775\nSo now I got a rebooting.\n\n397\n00:20:24.775 --> 00:20:26.300\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; First I've gotta wait for\n\n398\n00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:27.126\nit to finish booting.\n\n399\n00:20:27.126 --> 00:20:27.892\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n400\n00:20:27.892 --> 00:20:30.467\n&gt;&gt; Then I've got to\nrestart it one more time.\n\n401\n00:20:30.467 --> 00:20:32.714\nAnd frantically pound on the keyboard.\n\n402\n00:20:32.714 --> 00:20:34.822\nHoping I get into there.\n\n403\n00:20:34.822 --> 00:20:37.070\nNow with these advance startup options.\n\n404\n00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:38.900\nBasically I'm gonna go in and click.\n\n405\n00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:40.930\nAnd say, go ahead and\nlaunch those startup options.\n\n406\n00:20:40.930 --> 00:20:42.510\nSo now I can sit back and wait for it.\n\n407\n00:20:42.510 --> 00:20:43.204\n&gt;&gt; I do you like that?\n\n408\n00:20:43.204 --> 00:20:45.109\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's a lot easier, right?\n\n409\n00:20:45.109 --> 00:20:45.860\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n410\n00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:48.050\nyou can see it's very similar\nto what we used to have.\n\n411\n00:20:48.050 --> 00:20:53.830\nI've got a numbered menu, debugging,\nboot logging, low res video.\n\n412\n00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:57.430\nSo if you're a driver, if you think\na video driver was causing a problem.\n\n413\n00:20:57.430 --> 00:20:59.160\nBoot logging, log the boot process.\n\n414\n00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:02.620\nTry to figure out where is it that\nit stops during the boot process?\n\n415\n00:21:02.620 --> 00:21:06.350\nWhat is causing the problem, or\npreventing my system from booting?\n\n416\n00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:07.310\nDebugging, again,\n\n417\n00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:11.840\nvery detailed logging, allowing me\nto step through the boot process.\n\n418\n00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:15.751\nSafe mode,\nloads up just known good built-in drivers,\n\n419\n00:21:15.751 --> 00:21:18.284\nignores all of your custom drivers.\n\n420\n00:21:18.284 --> 00:21:22.243\nAll of your custom settings so\nhopefully I could start the, and\n\n421\n00:21:22.243 --> 00:21:24.420\nthis is something I've noticed.\n\n422\n00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:29.061\nI think, I don't know if that's\na new feature but it times out.\n\n423\n00:21:29.061 --> 00:21:30.782\nIf you don't do anything from that screen.\n\n424\n00:21:30.782 --> 00:21:33.698\n&gt;&gt; That happen to us in the show where\nI was just talking and talking and\n\n425\n00:21:33.698 --> 00:21:35.790\nthen like my VM just said nope,\nwe're done.\n\n426\n00:21:35.790 --> 00:21:36.425\nYou're out of time.\n\n427\n00:21:36.425 --> 00:21:38.180\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I wonder if it is like\n\n428\n00:21:38.180 --> 00:21:41.690\nwith the virtualization environment or\nif it's on hardware.\n\n429\n00:21:41.690 --> 00:21:42.830\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think it's Windows.\n\n430\n00:21:42.830 --> 00:21:45.990\nI am pretty sure and\nthat's something I should research.\n\n431\n00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:49.740\nBut normally that's not something\nyou're gonna have to deal with, right?\n\n432\n00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:52.500\nBecause you don't typically\ngo to that screen and then-\n\n433\n00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:53.210\n&gt;&gt; Start talking about it.\n\n434\n00:21:53.210 --> 00:21:53.850\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Start talking to\n\n435\n00:21:53.850 --> 00:21:56.620\nsomebody about the weather or\nthe football game last night.\n\n436\n00:21:56.620 --> 00:21:59.400\nOr the Senate hearings or\nanything like that, right.\n\n437\n00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:02.500\nSo usually you get that venue,\nand you make your choice.\n\n438\n00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:05.940\nA little different scenario here with us,\nlike talking and talking, and talking,\n\n439\n00:22:05.940 --> 00:22:07.120\ngoing shoot.\n\n440\n00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:08.320\nIt went away.\n\n441\n00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:13.510\nSo let me reboot, I did try to do my F12,\nI did not get into there, so.\n\n442\n00:22:13.510 --> 00:22:16.580\n&gt;&gt; Also while we're waiting,\nI do see in the chat someone says that,\n\n443\n00:22:16.580 --> 00:22:21.350\na Microsoft employee says that\nthey pronounce UEFI as yoofi.\n\n444\n00:22:21.350 --> 00:22:25.434\nAnd I thought that was kind of funny,\nI've never started like that, I don't know\n\n445\n00:22:25.434 --> 00:22:29.001\nabout you Mike but I heard another\nfunny one, I was listen to an Ignite.\n\n446\n00:22:29.001 --> 00:22:32.791\nOne of their sessions that had\nbeen recorded yesterday, and\n\n447\n00:22:32.791 --> 00:22:36.442\ninstead of saying U-R-L\nthe presenter kept saying url.\n\n448\n00:22:36.442 --> 00:22:41.099\nAnd I was like, if they've got their own\nlittle dialects for that geographic,\n\n449\n00:22:41.099 --> 00:22:43.824\nmaybe those folks out in Redmond or\nwhatever.\n\n450\n00:22:43.824 --> 00:22:44.970\n&gt;&gt; Interesting, yeah.\n\n451\n00:22:44.970 --> 00:22:50.245\nI have never heard of yoofi before,\nbut I don't talk to a lot of people.\n\n452\n00:22:50.245 --> 00:22:51.460\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I do all the talking,\n\n453\n00:22:51.460 --> 00:22:54.050\nyou don't have people talking back,\nso [LAUGH].\n\n454\n00:22:54.050 --> 00:22:58.644\nNo, but I I don't know if I can say\nthat one or not, we'll see, yeah, yoofi.\n\n455\n00:22:58.644 --> 00:23:00.830\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right, so\n\n456\n00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:03.998\ngetting back into my Update and\nSecurity settings,\n\n457\n00:23:06.683 --> 00:23:11.530\nSlowly but surely here, getting down to\nRecovery, and then my Advanced Startup.\n\n458\n00:23:13.430 --> 00:23:19.640\nGive it just a second and we'll take\na look at our last couple options here.\n\n459\n00:23:22.510 --> 00:23:25.780\nAll right, so back into Troubleshoot,\nand then Advanced Options.\n\n460\n00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:30.829\nAnd then we were looking\nat the Startup Settings.\n\n461\n00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:35.835\nAgain, and I'm not gonna click restart\nthis time and I'm not gonna talk too long.\n\n462\n00:23:35.835 --> 00:23:39.910\nBecause I don't want to actually it's\nthe next screen that times out, but\n\n463\n00:23:39.910 --> 00:23:41.220\nI think you get the idea, right?\n\n464\n00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:43.400\nYou get a numbered list and\nyou pick the number.\n\n465\n00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:46.350\nTypically you use your\nF1 keys across the top.\n\n466\n00:23:46.350 --> 00:23:50.240\nSo for one you hit F1,\nfor five you hit F5.\n\n467\n00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:52.220\nAnd you choose the mode\nyou wanna boot into.\n\n468\n00:23:52.220 --> 00:23:55.690\nSo if you're having trouble, Safe Mode.\n\n469\n00:23:55.690 --> 00:23:58.160\nSafe Mode will get me back\ninto the system, right?\n\n470\n00:23:58.160 --> 00:23:59.862\nIf it's a driver problem, for example.\n\n471\n00:23:59.862 --> 00:24:02.039\nSafe Mode will get me back in there and\n\n472\n00:24:02.039 --> 00:24:05.912\nallow me to maybe open up Device Manager\nand do a driver rollback.\n\n473\n00:24:05.912 --> 00:24:10.062\nIf I think that's the problem or\nthat's what's causing the issue.\n\n474\n00:24:10.062 --> 00:24:13.191\nOr just, if I can,\nsuccessfully boot into safe mode,\n\n475\n00:24:13.191 --> 00:24:15.850\nif we remember what safe mode is, right?\n\n476\n00:24:15.850 --> 00:24:19.070\nSafe mode says, hey,\nI'm gonna use known good settings,\n\n477\n00:24:19.070 --> 00:24:24.120\nI'm gonna use built-in generic\ndrivers none of your custom drivers.\n\n478\n00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:28.810\nAnd so, if I can't boot normally,\nbut I can boot into safe mode,\n\n479\n00:24:28.810 --> 00:24:33.130\nwell then, the problem most likely\nis a driver-related issue, right,\n\n480\n00:24:33.130 --> 00:24:35.780\nbecause that's the difference\nbetween normal and safe mode.\n\n481\n00:24:35.780 --> 00:24:38.929\n&gt;&gt; I'll tell you, when I first\nstarted as a computer technician,\n\n482\n00:24:38.929 --> 00:24:41.628\ncleaning machines, and\ncleaning up a lot of malware.\n\n483\n00:24:41.628 --> 00:24:45.375\nAnd Safe Mode was like my BFF,\nbecause we had those live CDs,\n\n484\n00:24:45.375 --> 00:24:48.317\nthose bootable CDs,\nwhere we could go ahead and\n\n485\n00:24:48.317 --> 00:24:53.244\nrun any kind of scanning options, like\nany kind of anti-malware software that\n\n486\n00:24:53.244 --> 00:24:57.390\nwe might not have been able to run\nin the regular operating system.\n\n487\n00:24:57.390 --> 00:25:00.222\nSo without running in Safe mode,\nthat's an option there.\n\n488\n00:25:00.222 --> 00:25:05.250\nLike, well, you can also boot from a live\nCD and or, just as like troubleshooting,\n\n489\n00:25:05.250 --> 00:25:08.610\nstart up in that safe mode and\ntry to initiate a scan from there, too.\n\n490\n00:25:08.610 --> 00:25:12.220\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, malware that's\nloading up on start process,\n\n491\n00:25:12.220 --> 00:25:14.610\nwon't load up during, in safe mode, so\n\n492\n00:25:14.610 --> 00:25:17.620\nit gives me a chance to try to get in\nthere and remove some of that stuff.\n\n493\n00:25:17.620 --> 00:25:19.520\nThe files won't be locked,\nthey won't be in use,\n\n494\n00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:22.060\nso that's definitely a very handy thing.\n\n495\n00:25:22.060 --> 00:25:26.680\nSo that was the start up settings, the\nlast one was gonna be that command prompt\n\n496\n00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:30.270\nand again, that's gonna just\nlaunch me into the command prompt.\n\n497\n00:25:30.270 --> 00:25:34.350\nSo not too terribly exciting here, but\nif I have a command line utility that\n\n498\n00:25:34.350 --> 00:25:38.850\nI want to use to try to fix that system,\nthis is going to be the way to go.\n\n499\n00:25:40.522 --> 00:25:42.250\nAll right,\nI know we getting a little short on time,\n\n500\n00:25:42.250 --> 00:25:46.290\nwe just got a few more things I want to\ncover, so we might go a hair long here,\n\n501\n00:25:46.290 --> 00:25:50.021\nCherokee, cause there's not enough for\nanother full episode.\n\n502\n00:25:50.021 --> 00:25:52.983\n&gt;&gt; All right, I'll allow it this one time,\nMike [LAUGH].\n\n503\n00:25:52.983 --> 00:25:54.987\n&gt;&gt; Okay, thank you, all right, so\n\n504\n00:25:54.987 --> 00:25:58.922\nwe'll let this guy boot,\ncoming back in, I wanna take a look at,\n\n505\n00:25:58.922 --> 00:26:02.880\nI think we've seen everything\nout of the recovery environment.\n\n506\n00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:06.900\nI just wanna take a quick\npeek at a driver rollback,\n\n507\n00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:13.510\ncuz again, it is considered a method\nthat I can use to try to restore or\n\n508\n00:26:13.510 --> 00:26:18.920\nfix my system, if a driver is indeed\nwhat is causing the problem, all right?\n\n509\n00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:21.270\nSo, of course, I have to authenticate,\nit's a great thing and\n\n510\n00:26:21.270 --> 00:26:24.360\nsomething we need to understand, right?\n\n511\n00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:28.740\nIt's not like I can bypass security by\nusing one of these startup methods, so\n\n512\n00:26:28.740 --> 00:26:32.270\nyou can't just go to some random\nmachine and try to reboot it and then,\n\n513\n00:26:32.270 --> 00:26:38.760\nget in without having a user account and\npassword that's valid on that system.\n\n514\n00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:41.790\nSo that is good to know, it's also\na potential test question, right,\n\n515\n00:26:41.790 --> 00:26:44.970\nyou do have to authenticate when\nyou're getting into system restore.\n\n516\n00:26:44.970 --> 00:26:47.590\nYou do have to authenticate when\nyou get into the command prompt,\n\n517\n00:26:47.590 --> 00:26:50.510\nbecause you have access to the system now.\n\n518\n00:26:51.610 --> 00:26:55.982\nI was just gonna do, as an example,\nyou'll see some of this information like,\n\n519\n00:26:55.982 --> 00:26:59.020\nIP config runs, but\nI don't have any networking loaded up.\n\n520\n00:26:59.020 --> 00:27:01.310\nSome commands you're gonna\nfind are not available.\n\n521\n00:27:01.310 --> 00:27:07.010\nThis is a limited command prompt window,\nbut I can do,\n\n522\n00:27:07.010 --> 00:27:11.610\nI don't even know, you have like,\nfix boot is not even in, fix mbr?\n\n523\n00:27:11.610 --> 00:27:16.310\nOf course, I'm not using,\nyeah, any of that stuff, so\n\n524\n00:27:18.150 --> 00:27:20.620\nagain, if you have command line utility-\n&gt;&gt; Because of your UEFI,\n\n525\n00:27:20.620 --> 00:27:21.500\nis that what you wanted to mention?\n\n526\n00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:26.780\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, because I'm BIOS, I'm not\ndoing UEFI or I'm doing UEFI, not BIOS,\n\n527\n00:27:26.780 --> 00:27:30.400\non this system, so\nthat was the command prompt.\n\n528\n00:27:31.420 --> 00:27:34.580\nAll right, I think we saw everything,\nthe only other\n\n529\n00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:39.050\none that we really didn't click on is\nthis See More Recovery Options down here.\n\n530\n00:27:39.050 --> 00:27:42.700\nAnd if I click on that I have\ngo back to previous version.\n\n531\n00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:45.370\nAnd this is a good one to know, too,\nit is potentially a test question,\n\n532\n00:27:45.370 --> 00:27:49.780\nas well, especially with Windows 10 and\nthese updates coming out and\n\n533\n00:27:49.780 --> 00:27:51.430\nnot having as much control.\n\n534\n00:27:51.430 --> 00:27:56.180\nI don't want to say, not having as much\ncontrol, but a lot of this gets pushed\n\n535\n00:27:56.180 --> 00:27:59.810\nout, I'm trying to think of a good\npolitically correct way to say that.\n\n536\n00:27:59.810 --> 00:28:01.340\n&gt;&gt; Quicker than it has been historically?\n\n537\n00:28:01.340 --> 00:28:04.110\n&gt;&gt; Well, they do give us\nthe options to control whether or\n\n538\n00:28:04.110 --> 00:28:06.300\nnot we move to those new builds.\n\n539\n00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:09.240\nSo I don't wanna make it sound like\nthey're forcing it down there.\n\n540\n00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:12.530\nBut maybe you are okay with\ngetting those updates and\n\n541\n00:28:12.530 --> 00:28:14.700\nthat spring creator's update comes out.\n\n542\n00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:17.210\nAnd it causes problems\nwith an application,\n\n543\n00:28:17.210 --> 00:28:18.760\nI can go back to the previous version.\n\n544\n00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:20.460\nRemember, when Windows does those updates,\n\n545\n00:28:20.460 --> 00:28:25.290\nwhen they roll out those creator's updates\nor whatever they continue to call them.\n\n546\n00:28:25.290 --> 00:28:29.980\nUsually it stores information that\nwill allow me to roll back to\n\n547\n00:28:29.980 --> 00:28:32.260\na previous version if\nit's causing a problem.\n\n548\n00:28:32.260 --> 00:28:34.270\nAnd this is how I would\nget to that option,\n\n549\n00:28:34.270 --> 00:28:36.570\nis through that See More Recovery Options.\n\n550\n00:28:36.570 --> 00:28:41.700\nIt's kind of a little loop here,\nwe just couldn't fit,\n\n551\n00:28:41.700 --> 00:28:45.670\nI guess, they couldn't fit that one more\noption, move this down a little bit and\n\n552\n00:28:45.670 --> 00:28:48.490\nput that one more option here-\n&gt;&gt; It wouldn't have been so\n\n553\n00:28:48.490 --> 00:28:52.660\nbalanced graphically, [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It would have been unbalanced, I just,\n\n554\n00:28:52.660 --> 00:28:56.530\nI mean, I'm sure those resolution things\nthat people out there at Microsoft and\n\n555\n00:28:56.530 --> 00:29:00.510\nthe UI designers are good at what they do,\nso I'm just picking a little bit.\n\n556\n00:29:00.510 --> 00:29:03.790\nBut might have more options coming here,\neventually, right?\n\n557\n00:29:03.790 --> 00:29:07.180\nSo that does just flip you back and forth\nbetween all over your advanced options.\n\n558\n00:29:07.180 --> 00:29:07.800\n&gt;&gt; Pretty cool.\n\n559\n00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:10.100\n&gt;&gt; It is, all right, let's go back into,\n\n560\n00:29:10.100 --> 00:29:14.840\nI'm gonna continue and\nenter into my Windows 10 install.\n\n561\n00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:19.390\nAs I said, I wasn't gonna last look at\nthe one more recovery option which is\n\n562\n00:29:19.390 --> 00:29:23.135\nthe driver roll back, so\nlet this reboot this real quick.\n\n563\n00:29:23.135 --> 00:29:27.310\nAnd driver roll back has\nbeen around forever, and\n\n564\n00:29:27.310 --> 00:29:30.614\nwe go into our device manager\nwhere we work with our drivers,\n\n565\n00:29:30.614 --> 00:29:35.120\nit shows me all my devices that I have\nconnected to the machine, except printers.\n\n566\n00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:36.540\nAnd I can work with the drivers,\n\n567\n00:29:36.540 --> 00:29:40.800\nI can see what the current driver is,\nI can update drivers from there,\n\n568\n00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:45.210\nI can remove devices from there, but I can\nalso do what's called a driver rollback.\n\n569\n00:29:45.210 --> 00:29:49.710\nWhat that means is if I have updated\na driver and that driver causes,\n\n570\n00:29:49.710 --> 00:29:55.140\nthat updated driver causes a problem,\nI can roll back to the previous version.\n\n571\n00:29:55.140 --> 00:29:57.370\nI want you to pay attention\nto what I said there.\n\n572\n00:29:57.370 --> 00:30:01.750\nIf I have updated the driver,\nI can use driver rollback.\n\n573\n00:30:01.750 --> 00:30:05.570\nIf you have never updated the driver,\nthere's nothing to roll back to.\n\n574\n00:30:05.570 --> 00:30:08.960\nI know after I say it, it's like,\nduh, that makes sense Mike, but\n\n575\n00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:11.540\non the exam they could try to get\nyou with something like that.\n\n576\n00:30:11.540 --> 00:30:14.660\nSo understand that driver\nroll back is only available\n\n577\n00:30:14.660 --> 00:30:15.790\nif you've updated the driver.\n\n578\n00:30:15.790 --> 00:30:18.940\nIf you've never updated it,\nthere's nothing to roll back to,\n\n579\n00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:22.940\nit only remembers your, oops, I'm typing\nmy password and nothing is happening,\n\n580\n00:30:22.940 --> 00:30:24.200\nlet's give it a little focus.\n\n581\n00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:30.050\nIt only remembers one previous version,\nso if you had driver version a and then\n\n582\n00:30:30.050 --> 00:30:35.460\nyou upgraded to driver version b, and then\nlater on you upgraded to driver version c,\n\n583\n00:30:35.460 --> 00:30:40.430\nyou could roll back to b, but you won't be\nable to continue to roll back to driver a,\n\n584\n00:30:40.430 --> 00:30:42.380\nit only remembers one previous version.\n\n585\n00:30:42.380 --> 00:30:46.680\nBut this is an extremely useful method,\n\n586\n00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:49.960\ncuz you have to have a driver and\nit causes a problem.\n\n587\n00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:54.160\nNow you need to go back to the previous\ndriver, what was the previous driver?\n\n588\n00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:55.649\nWhen you update a driver, Cherokee,\n\n589\n00:30:55.649 --> 00:30:58.450\ncould you write down the previous\ndriver version number?\n\n590\n00:30:58.450 --> 00:31:00.840\n&gt;&gt; Every single time.\n\n591\n00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:01.646\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, okay.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n592\n00:31:01.646 --> 00:31:03.140\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We're buying that, right?\n\n593\n00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:04.990\nYeah.\n\n594\n00:31:04.990 --> 00:31:07.550\nI know I don't, maybe I should.\n\n595\n00:31:07.550 --> 00:31:11.210\n&gt;&gt; In a perfect world, but no, I don't.\n\n596\n00:31:11.210 --> 00:31:12.640\n&gt;&gt; But typically we don't, right?\n\n597\n00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:14.660\nAnd so, now all of a sudden,\nI've got to figure out, well,\n\n598\n00:31:14.660 --> 00:31:17.240\nwhat version was it that was working?\n\n599\n00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:19.950\nMaybe a user thinking they\nwere doing the right thing,\n\n600\n00:31:19.950 --> 00:31:23.380\nmaybe they have administrative access on\nthe system and they updated a driver, and\n\n601\n00:31:23.380 --> 00:31:24.400\nnow it's causing a problem.\n\n602\n00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:26.470\nThey didn't write down\nthe previous version, so\n\n603\n00:31:26.470 --> 00:31:28.810\nI've gotta figure out what\nthe previous version was.\n\n604\n00:31:28.810 --> 00:31:29.770\nWhere do we go get it?\n\n605\n00:31:29.770 --> 00:31:32.528\nSometimes, getting older\nversions of drivers-\n\n606\n00:31:32.528 --> 00:31:34.548\n&gt;&gt; It is like a good practice to do that,\n\n607\n00:31:34.548 --> 00:31:36.770\nespecially in a business environment.\n\n608\n00:31:36.770 --> 00:31:41.550\nPersonal, I'm a little more lax, but\nwhen it's someone else's money and\n\n609\n00:31:41.550 --> 00:31:44.340\nequipment it's a little too-\n&gt;&gt; Right, absolutely.\n\n610\n00:31:44.340 --> 00:31:48.000\nBut yeah, a lot of times it's difficult\non a vendor's website to find\n\n611\n00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:52.017\na driver from two versions ago, they\nwant you to get the latest and greatest.\n\n612\n00:31:52.017 --> 00:31:56.380\nAnd you gotta dive through their site to\nfind an older version of that driver.\n\n613\n00:31:56.380 --> 00:32:00.057\nSo here if you take a look at my screen,\nI'm gonna launch up Device Manager.\n\n614\n00:32:02.393 --> 00:32:07.238\nAnd in Device Manager Let's take\na look at something simple that's\n\n615\n00:32:07.238 --> 00:32:09.540\nnot gonna cause a problem here.\n\n616\n00:32:09.540 --> 00:32:13.490\nI've got my pointing device, right,\nmy mouse in my little virtual machine.\n\n617\n00:32:13.490 --> 00:32:14.420\nI double click on that,\n\n618\n00:32:14.420 --> 00:32:18.270\nI can see everything is working fine,\nplugged into the PS2 mouse port.\n\n619\n00:32:18.270 --> 00:32:23.070\nI go to the driver tab and\nhere I can see who created the driver,\n\n620\n00:32:23.070 --> 00:32:24.978\nwhen it was published, Driver Version.\n\n621\n00:32:24.978 --> 00:32:26.920\nThis information is very\nuseful when I'm going out and\n\n622\n00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:30.890\nlooking to see if there\nis a more current driver.\n\n623\n00:32:30.890 --> 00:32:35.180\nI can update the driver, but notice roll\nback is grayed out because I've never\n\n624\n00:32:35.180 --> 00:32:37.789\nupdated it,\nthere's nothing to roll back to.\n\n625\n00:32:37.789 --> 00:32:42.528\nI'm going to choose Update Driver and\nI'll go ahead and browse my computer, and\n\n626\n00:32:42.528 --> 00:32:44.700\nI'll pick from a list of available.\n\n627\n00:32:44.700 --> 00:32:48.380\nI'm gonna switch this over\nto a PS compatible mouse.\n\n628\n00:32:48.380 --> 00:32:49.170\nI'll click Next.\n\n629\n00:32:50.390 --> 00:32:52.781\nAnd just using this an an example,\nI'll click close.\n\n630\n00:32:52.781 --> 00:32:56.666\n&gt;&gt; Mike really has a PS mouse that he\nfound, and he wants to bring it back.\n\n631\n00:32:56.666 --> 00:32:57.535\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n632\n00:32:57.535 --> 00:32:58.300\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right?\n\n633\n00:32:58.300 --> 00:33:01.270\nAnd of course, any time you change\na driver, you're gonna reboot the system,\n\n634\n00:33:01.270 --> 00:33:04.680\ncuz drivers are loaded up when\nthe system starts for the most part.\n\n635\n00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:09.740\nSo we'll say Yes, we'll let this reboot,\nwe come back in and we\n\n636\n00:33:09.740 --> 00:33:13.535\nshould see that I'm now using a different\ndriver and hopefully my mouse still works.\n\n637\n00:33:13.535 --> 00:33:14.330\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n638\n00:33:14.330 --> 00:33:15.100\n&gt;&gt; That'll be nice.\n\n639\n00:33:15.100 --> 00:33:16.250\nI still have a mouse though.\n\n640\n00:33:16.250 --> 00:33:18.290\nI've tested it and\nI know it's going to work.\n\n641\n00:33:18.290 --> 00:33:20.260\nSo, we'll let that go.\n\n642\n00:33:22.020 --> 00:33:24.560\nIt is frozen Cheerios now.\n\n643\n00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:26.995\nOkay good, you can't see it cuz\nthere's nothing to see here.\n\n644\n00:33:26.995 --> 00:33:28.530\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Move along, nothing to see here.\n\n645\n00:33:30.110 --> 00:33:31.400\nAll right, almost done.\n\n646\n00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:33.390\nI know I'm a little long\nwinded on this episode.\n\n647\n00:33:33.390 --> 00:33:34.920\nThank you everybody for bearing with me.\n\n648\n00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:36.960\nWe have a lot of reboots here.\n\n649\n00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:38.660\nWe'll get this one rebooted.\n\n650\n00:33:38.660 --> 00:33:40.890\n&gt;&gt; Hopefully, they are not thinking\nabout lunch and frozen Cheerios now.\n\n651\n00:33:40.890 --> 00:33:42.361\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It sounds like a new cereal.\n\n652\n00:33:42.361 --> 00:33:43.060\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I know.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n653\n00:33:43.060 --> 00:33:45.335\n&gt;&gt; It might be tasty.\n\n654\n00:33:45.335 --> 00:33:52.055\n[LAUGH] All right, here we go.\n\n655\n00:33:52.055 --> 00:33:54.740\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Slowly but surely we are rebooting.\n\n656\n00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:58.835\nMy system's going,\nplease don't reboot me one more time.\n\n657\n00:33:58.835 --> 00:33:59.581\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n\n658\n00:33:59.581 --> 00:34:02.213\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n659\n00:34:02.213 --> 00:34:05.580\n&gt;&gt; But we've made it through\nquite a few reboots here, so.\n\n660\n00:34:05.580 --> 00:34:06.960\n&gt;&gt; We have, yeah and it's what?\n\n661\n00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:09.240\nLucky for us, well this 10 is\npretty quick on the reboot.\n\n662\n00:34:09.240 --> 00:34:10.470\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I will say,\n\n663\n00:34:10.470 --> 00:34:14.040\nof course they move a lot of\nthat stuff out further down so\n\n664\n00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:15.800\nyou can get your desktop sooner.\n\n665\n00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:18.240\nBut yeah, they've done a good job.\n\n666\n00:34:18.240 --> 00:34:20.620\nI like it, give them their props there.\n\n667\n00:34:21.830 --> 00:34:25.980\nAll right, now I've got my desktop,\nso let me log back in.\n\n668\n00:34:25.980 --> 00:34:28.380\nAnd you guys can take\na look at my screen here.\n\n669\n00:34:29.453 --> 00:34:32.580\nThank you Ms. Tanesha.\n\n670\n00:34:32.580 --> 00:34:35.240\nAnd back into device manager.\n\n671\n00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:40.210\n&gt;&gt; I do see another helpful\ntip here in our chat.\n\n672\n00:34:40.210 --> 00:34:41.490\nYou guys are going great.\n\n673\n00:34:41.490 --> 00:34:44.260\nThis one,\nthanks to Mike again from Microsoft.\n\n674\n00:34:44.260 --> 00:34:48.270\nLooks like that previous version\nfeature currently is valid for\n\n675\n00:34:48.270 --> 00:34:50.800\nten days after you've upgraded.\n\n676\n00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:54.390\nSo that might be something you wanna look\ninto to see if there's a grace period for\n\n677\n00:34:54.390 --> 00:34:56.430\nthat rollback option.\n\n678\n00:34:56.430 --> 00:34:59.140\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, because I was under\nthe impression that they kept\n\n679\n00:34:59.140 --> 00:35:03.220\nthe previous version until you did a disc\ncleanup or something like that, and\n\n680\n00:35:03.220 --> 00:35:05.210\nthat is a great point, thank you for\nmentioning that, Mike.\n\n681\n00:35:05.210 --> 00:35:10.260\nSo, it might be a time limit on how\nlong you can go before you can, or\n\n682\n00:35:10.260 --> 00:35:13.300\nthere's a certain point where you\ncan't roll back to a previous version.\n\n683\n00:35:13.300 --> 00:35:17.570\nProbably cleaning up some of the files cuz\nI'm sure Microsoft is gonna get a lot of\n\n684\n00:35:17.570 --> 00:35:21.020\ngrief if they start storing too many\nolder versions on my system, and\n\n685\n00:35:21.020 --> 00:35:23.500\nmy disk space is gone.\n\n686\n00:35:23.500 --> 00:35:24.370\nAnd I can't figure out why.\n\n687\n00:35:24.370 --> 00:35:28.450\nYour average consumer, why, where's all\nmy, why is Windows taking up 40 gigs?\n\n688\n00:35:28.450 --> 00:35:30.750\nBecause I've got a previous\nversion on there.\n\n689\n00:35:30.750 --> 00:35:32.570\nSo, I can definitely see that.\n\n690\n00:35:32.570 --> 00:35:33.150\nGood to know.\n\n691\n00:35:34.370 --> 00:35:35.550\nAll right.\nNow you can see,\n\n692\n00:35:35.550 --> 00:35:38.870\nI'm using that PS2 compatible mouse,\ncuz I'd change that.\n\n693\n00:35:38.870 --> 00:35:43.030\nAnd so I double click on that,\nand go back into driver.\n\n694\n00:35:43.030 --> 00:35:47.820\nAnd now I have my roll back driver,\nI see it now instead of VM ware.\n\n695\n00:35:47.820 --> 00:35:49.286\nI'll be using a Microsoft mouse.\n\n696\n00:35:49.286 --> 00:35:52.670\nSo it did indeed change my drivers.\n\n697\n00:35:52.670 --> 00:35:57.410\nNow I have the Roll Back Driver option,\nso I should be able to click then.\n\n698\n00:35:57.410 --> 00:36:00.080\nWe can go ahead and\nclick it and launch this.\n\n699\n00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:03.760\nIt asks me why I want to roll back\nto previously installed driver.\n\n700\n00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:08.390\nMaybe my apps don't work with this driver,\ndifferent choices you can make here.\n\n701\n00:36:08.390 --> 00:36:10.910\nThis is just giving\nMicrosoft some feedback.\n\n702\n00:36:10.910 --> 00:36:13.210\nHelping them make the systems better.\n\n703\n00:36:13.210 --> 00:36:17.496\nSo I'll say for another reason,\n\n704\n00:36:17.496 --> 00:36:23.627\nthen we'll just say\ntesting driver rollback.\n\n705\n00:36:23.627 --> 00:36:27.280\nDon't wanna give them any misinformation.\n\n706\n00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:32.380\nWe'll say yes, I'll zoom back out,\nI'll click close.\n\n707\n00:36:32.380 --> 00:36:34.420\nAnd of course I'll have to\nrestart this system for\n\n708\n00:36:34.420 --> 00:36:36.630\nthat to take effect, but we've seen that.\n\n709\n00:36:36.630 --> 00:36:38.634\nAnd that's really what\nI wanted to show you,\n\n710\n00:36:38.634 --> 00:36:40.810\nwas just where you go to\ndo that driver roll back.\n\n711\n00:36:40.810 --> 00:36:45.170\nSo several different options that I can\nuse to help restore a system that's\n\n712\n00:36:45.170 --> 00:36:46.220\nhaving trouble.\n\n713\n00:36:46.220 --> 00:36:49.040\nGotta make sure we understand\nall of our options and\n\n714\n00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:50.730\nwhen to use the appropriate method.\n\n715\n00:36:50.730 --> 00:36:54.590\n&gt;&gt; And the great thing is Mike, if we\ndon't remember and we do have one of those\n\n716\n00:36:54.590 --> 00:36:57.841\nsituations where we're in a pinch\nwe can use another system and\n\n717\n00:36:57.841 --> 00:37:01.880\ncome back even on your phone and watch\nMike on IT Pro TV to help us through that.\n\n718\n00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:03.410\nSo thank you so much Mike.\n\n719\n00:37:03.410 --> 00:37:06.960\nAnd thank you guys so much for being with\nus today but for now let's sign out.\n\n720\n00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:08.390\nI've been your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n721\n00:37:08.390 --> 00:37:09.180\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n722\n00:37:09.180 --> 00:37:11.040\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at IT Pro TV.\n\n723\n00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:14.988\n[MUSIC]\n\n724\n00:37:14.988

You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:10.819 --> 00:00:14.980\n&gt;&gt; Welcome everyone to your\nConfigure Windows Devices series.\n\n5\n00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:17.850\nStudying up for that 70-697 exam.\n\n6\n00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.360\nI'm your host, Cherokee Boose, and\n\n7\n00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:23.610\non this episode we'll be taking a look\nat how to configure file recovery.\n\n8\n00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:26.020\nAnd you know it,\nwith us today in the studios we have Mr.\n\n9\n00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:28.970\nMike Rodrick, thanks so\nmuch for stopping by Mike.\n\n10\n00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:30.150\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for having me back Cherokee,\n\n11\n00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.360\nexcited as always to be talking\nabout good old Windows 10.\n\n12\n00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.190\nAnd in this episode yeah, file recovery\nspecicically we're gonna be taking a look\n\n13\n00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:38.960\nat something known as file history.\n\n14\n00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.480\nAnd this is a feature that\ngot added into Windows 10\n\n15\n00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.150\n&gt;&gt; And it gives us the ability\n\n16\n00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:48.890\nto go back to, dare I say it,\nprevious versions of a file.\n\n17\n00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:50.870\nCuz we used to have something\ncalled previous versions but\n\n18\n00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.270\nwe still have that in there as well.\n\n19\n00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:59.620\nBut file history, it's a method that I can\nuse to go back and recover a document.\n\n20\n00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:02.350\nIf maybe I've made\nchanges to a file right?\n\n21\n00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:03.760\nI open up a word document,\n\n22\n00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.280\nI made some changes to it, deleted\na couple paragraphs, added a few things.\n\n23\n00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.380\nAnd now I wanna go back,\nI need to get those changes back or\n\n24\n00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.900\nundo those changes file\nhistory is where I can do it.\n\n25\n00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.030\nSo, let's dive in a little be\neasier I think to understand as we\n\n26\n00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.110\nlook at some of the options.\n\n27\n00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:21.520\nFirst.\n\n28\n00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.100\nIt's not turned on by default.\n\n29\n00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.980\nSo we are gonna need to turn it on.\n\n30\n00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:28.430\nI'm gonna go to my Start menu and\ntype in file history.\n\n31\n00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.340\nAnd you'll see it comes up if\nI type it all the way out.\n\n32\n00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.800\nDrives me crazy with their interface,\n\n33\n00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:38.500\nbut you see restore your\nfiles with File History.\n\n34\n00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:39.750\nThen I have my backup settings.\n\n35\n00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.210\nIf I don't type the word\nhistory out completely,\n\n36\n00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.940\nI can go right into my backup settings.\n\n37\n00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.450\nWe'll choose that Either\nway you wanna go is fine.\n\n38\n00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.630\nOnce you get into your Settings and\nthen you go down to Backup,\n\n39\n00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.430\nthis is where we can set up File History.\n\n40\n00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:58.500\nAnd you can see their little description\nthere, back up your files to another drive\n\n41\n00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.470\nand restore them if the originals\nare lost, damaged or deleted.\n\n42\n00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:08.560\nSo we're gonna need to place to store our\nfile history, so we need to add a drive.\n\n43\n00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:14.270\nNow, the cool thing is, the drive could\nbe another physical disk in your machine.\n\n44\n00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:19.460\nIt could be an external drive which is\ntypically what we wanna use, right?\n\n45\n00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:23.520\nIf it's a disk in your machine,\nif something happens to that hard drive,\n\n46\n00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.200\nyou lose your file history as well.\n\n47\n00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:31.880\nBut a USB, like a thumb drive or a USB\nhard drive can also be a network share.\n\n48\n00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.115\nIs a, yhe valid option as well.\n\n49\n00:02:34.115 --> 00:02:36.715\n&gt;&gt; So\nsomething to consider then Mike would be\n\n50\n00:02:36.715 --> 00:02:40.445\nstorage space that's available\ndepending on what I'm backing up right?\n\n51\n00:02:40.445 --> 00:02:41.465\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n52\n00:02:41.465 --> 00:02:45.625\nHome groups can actually use\na shared connected drive as well.\n\n53\n00:02:45.625 --> 00:02:49.885\nAt home I have one of those old\nschool western digital my books.\n\n54\n00:02:49.885 --> 00:02:52.195\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; The three and a half inch externals.\n\n55\n00:02:52.195 --> 00:02:53.875\nYeah it just sits on my desk and\ndoes nothing.\n\n56\n00:02:53.875 --> 00:02:57.940\nSo I plug that into my machine and\nThat's where all my file history goes.\n\n57\n00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.510\nHere on my work machine I\nactually use a network share.\n\n58\n00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.620\nAnd so every time I connect to\nthe network it creates this file history.\n\n59\n00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.670\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and choose, this\nis a thumb drive I just popped in there.\n\n60\n00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.280\nIt's an empty drive, I'll select that.\n\n61\n00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:13.820\nYou can see then it just turns it on,\nand that's it.\n\n62\n00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:16.640\nI mean, at that point We can\ngo back to our business,\n\n63\n00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.620\nfile history is working\nas keeping it safe.\n\n64\n00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.850\nBut let's take a look at options and\nunderstand what is doing and\n\n65\n00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:26.710\nwe also need to see how we\ncan recover files as well.\n\n66\n00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:29.960\nSo, what's happening once\nI turn on file history,\n\n67\n00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:34.720\nthe idea is window is gonna appear and\nclearly make back up of my files.\n\n68\n00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.880\nUnless there is this unscheduled basis.\n\n69\n00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.680\nAnd then if I have trouble with the file,\n\n70\n00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.030\nif I need to go back\nto a previous version.\n\n71\n00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:46.810\nI can browse through those previous\nversions and find the one I want and\n\n72\n00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:47.410\nrestore it.\n\n73\n00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.660\nSo let's take a look at\nthe options below here.\n\n74\n00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:55.379\nI'm gonna click more options And\n\n75\n00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:59.610\nhere I can see the default settings for\nfile history.\n\n76\n00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:02.790\nCurrent size of backup, zero,\nhasn't run anything yet.\n\n77\n00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:07.050\nDoesn't mean my total space available,\nyour data is not backed up yet, and\n\n78\n00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:08.180\nI can back it up now.\n\n79\n00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:13.690\nBelow there I have my schedule,\nand by default It's every hour.\n\n80\n00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:16.350\nAnd this is something that\nyou're gonna wanna think about.\n\n81\n00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:20.880\nIt's not like this is doing an old school\nbackup where it's copying the entire\n\n82\n00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.730\ndrive or anything like that.\n\n83\n00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:27.590\nSo when we think about space and how much\nit is going to use, you might think gosh,\n\n84\n00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:28.730\nI can't do this every hour.\n\n85\n00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:31.220\nI'm gonna out of space very quickly.\n\n86\n00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.640\nIt's backing files as they change.\n\n87\n00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.330\nIf a file hasn't changed,\n\n88\n00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.390\nIt doesn't need to back it up\nevery time it runs this, right.\n\n89\n00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:39.610\n&gt;&gt; Like a differential backup?\n\n90\n00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:43.550\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so it's just gonna\nget those change documents,\n\n91\n00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:45.900\nwhich does keep the size pretty small.\n\n92\n00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.000\nThe initial backup could\ntake a little while.\n\n93\n00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.960\nKeep that in mind, because now there's no\ncopies of my files on that selected drive.\n\n94\n00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.370\nSo when I turn this on, and\n\n95\n00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:59.530\nI choose Backup Now, It's got to make\nthat initial backup of everything.\n\n96\n00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:01.670\nBecause everything is changed, right?\n\n97\n00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:03.730\nIt's all brand new,\nit's never seen it before.\n\n98\n00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:05.760\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So it grab all of that and\n\n99\n00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:10.450\nfrom that point on as it\ntakes those backups or\n\n100\n00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:14.750\nthe file history,\nit'll be getting those changed documents.\n\n101\n00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:16.710\nSo you might or might not want every hour,\n\n102\n00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:20.070\nyou know I changed mine in\nall my work machine to daily.\n\n103\n00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:24.510\nCuz I'm not in a position where I need to\nhave, if I'm making a lot of changes in\n\n104\n00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:26.670\ndocuments, I don't need\nevery hour's changes.\n\n105\n00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:28.680\nYou might be in your role, or\n\n106\n00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.140\nthe users you're supporting,\nthey make a lot of changes.\n\n107\n00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:35.010\nAnd they need to go back to what it\nwas an hour ago or two hours ago.\n\n108\n00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:37.480\nAll right, so\nthis is something you have to plan out.\n\n109\n00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:42.780\nFor me, once a day is plenty\nbecause it's the way I work.\n\n110\n00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:47.580\nYou can also choose how long you\nkeep those backups for, one month,\n\n111\n00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:48.110\nthree months.\n\n112\n00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:50.440\nYou've got several options there.\n\n113\n00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:55.630\nForever is the default, or until space\nis needed is another one of my options.\n\n114\n00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:59.893\nRight, I like to leave it on forever,\njust because.\n\n115\n00:05:59.893 --> 00:06:01.028\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n116\n00:06:01.028 --> 00:06:03.990\n&gt;&gt; So that means that like every hour,\n\n117\n00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:07.320\nI'd have to have the external\ndrive plugged in every hour.\n\n118\n00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:11.470\nIf that's my choice during that\nlocations to were am backing up, right?\n\n119\n00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:14.110\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\nif the location isn't available it just\n\n120\n00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:15.370\n&gt;&gt; Skips that cycle and\n\n121\n00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:16.890\nit will pick it up the next time.\n\n122\n00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:18.860\nLike with mine it's a network drive so\n\n123\n00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:22.730\nwhen I take my laptop home, obviously it\ncan't reach out and do those backups.\n\n124\n00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:27.370\nAs soon as I plug in the next day,\nit's going to take care of that.\n\n125\n00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:31.190\nDown below we can see where\nI can backup these folders.\n\n126\n00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:33.540\nAnd I've got a few listed here already.\n\n127\n00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:35.400\nAnd then I've got a couple\nof very important options.\n\n128\n00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:37.120\nOne is add a folder.\n\n129\n00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:39.830\nThe other one is exclude a folder.\n\n130\n00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:43.440\nSo first let's talk about\nwhat it's doing by default.\n\n131\n00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:46.490\nBy default, it's protecting all\nthe files in my user profile.\n\n132\n00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:51.240\nBasically my documents, my pictures,\nmy videos, things like that.\n\n133\n00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:54.260\nMy user profile, also libraries, right.\n\n134\n00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.810\nSo we've talked about\nlibraries in another episode,\n\n135\n00:06:56.810 --> 00:07:01.790\nwhere I can add additional folders\nto my documents library for example.\n\n136\n00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:06.530\nAnd have a show up underneath my\ndocuments, it would include those files,\n\n137\n00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:08.820\nas well singed files from one drive.\n\n138\n00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:13.040\nThe files from one drive that you chose\nto store locally on your machine.\n\n139\n00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:17.390\nIt's going to make sure there is\na back up or a file history or those.\n\n140\n00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:21.640\nSo those are the defaults, but\nwe can obviously change that.\n\n141\n00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:25.295\nSo as I go down through here,\nI can see, you should look here.\n\n142\n00:07:25.295 --> 00:07:28.430\nUser/mike.lab, that's my user account.\n\n143\n00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:31.810\nThese are all parts of my profile,\nmy documents, my downloads,\n\n144\n00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:34.780\nlinks, contacts, OneDrive, right?\n\n145\n00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:41.080\nPictures, documents, videos, all right?\n\n146\n00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:42.300\nBut we can choose.\n\n147\n00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:43.940\nWe don't have to stick\nwith those defaults.\n\n148\n00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:47.130\nLike videos, for example,\nthose can take up a lot of space,\n\n149\n00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:49.660\nand it's not like I'm changing them.\n\n150\n00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:51.440\nSo it's not gonna back them up many times.\n\n151\n00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:55.143\nI mean, again, you gotta kind of\nthink about how this is working.\n\n152\n00:07:55.143 --> 00:07:59.482\nLike I don't want it backing up videos\nbecause I don't need dozens of snapshots\n\n153\n00:07:59.482 --> 00:08:02.660\nof the video, right,\nmultiple copies of it.\n\n154\n00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:06.182\nIf the video's not changing you're\nonly gonna have one copy of it anyway.\n\n155\n00:08:06.182 --> 00:08:09.100\nSo there's something to think about there.\n\n156\n00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:13.150\nI'm gonna choose 'remove' just to show\nyou how to do this, I'll choose 'remove'.\n\n157\n00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:18.580\nAnd so that'll no longer\nbe part of my file history.\n\n158\n00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:22.930\nIt doesn't delete files from your\nfile history if you remove it.\n\n159\n00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:25.870\nIt'll no longer take\nsnapshots of those files.\n\n160\n00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:27.330\nBut it doesn't delete them.\n\n161\n00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:29.880\nSo if I go far enough,\nI could still find videos.\n\n162\n00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:32.410\nWhat else I want to say about that.\n\n163\n00:08:32.410 --> 00:08:36.840\nSo we can remove or\nconfigure the default options.\n\n164\n00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:40.230\nWe can also add folders, all right?\n\n165\n00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:45.660\nI can simply browse and\nfind a folder that's not included already.\n\n166\n00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:47.340\nI don't want to go to\nmy thumb drive there.\n\n167\n00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:51.230\n&gt;&gt; And we're talking about\non the local machine, so\n\n168\n00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:54.050\nI wouldn't want to browse\nto a network share, right?\n\n169\n00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:55.840\n&gt;&gt; Correct, yes.\nYeah, this is gonna make for\n\n170\n00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:57.930\nyour local system, exactly.\n\n171\n00:08:57.930 --> 00:09:00.470\nSo if I come in and now it's locked up.\n\n172\n00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:05.656\nIt might be in the middle of trying\nto do Now give it a second here.\n\n173\n00:09:05.656 --> 00:09:10.300\n[COUGH] We'll let that refresh [LAUGH] and\nthen hopefully I can use my machine again.\n\n174\n00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:13.700\nBut yes, we're gonna be\nlooking at local drives, but\n\n175\n00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:17.030\nI might have folders outside\nof my profile, right?\n\n176\n00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:20.430\nIn fact here,\nlet's take a look while this is stuck.\n\n177\n00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:24.000\nLet me go out to my physical machine,\nbecause I use File History, on here.\n\n178\n00:09:25.090 --> 00:09:27.130\nSo I open up File History.\n\n179\n00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:33.450\nI go down to my Recovery Options and\nthen Backup.\n\n180\n00:09:33.450 --> 00:09:36.000\nOr I could have gone straight to Backup.\n\n181\n00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.160\nI'll click More Options.\n\n182\n00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:41.150\nHere you can see I set it to daily.\n\n183\n00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:43.340\nAnd it's keeping them forever.\n\n184\n00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:46.660\nAs I scroll down through here,\nthis is all the same stuff,\n\n185\n00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:49.780\nall the stuff out of my Profile,\nall right?\n\n186\n00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:51.450\nBut maybe I wanna add a folder.\n\n187\n00:09:51.450 --> 00:09:53.950\nSo I can come up here and\nclick Add a folder.\n\n188\n00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:58.626\nAnd I could go to my D drive,\nwhich is not part of my profile.\n\n189\n00:09:58.626 --> 00:10:01.190\nAnd I've got them all of my scripts,\nmy PowerShell scripts [INAUDIBLE].\n\n190\n00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:04.605\nI may change these, and\nsometimes changes aren't good.\n\n191\n00:10:04.605 --> 00:10:05.675\n[LAUGH] They don't work.\n\n192\n00:10:05.675 --> 00:10:06.950\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So maybe if I wanna go back to\n\n193\n00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:09.690\na previous version\n&gt;&gt; So I'm gonna include this.\n\n194\n00:10:09.690 --> 00:10:14.390\nI'm gonna choose this folder, and\n\n195\n00:10:14.390 --> 00:10:18.790\nnow that the D column script\nsomewhere in my list, there we go.\n\n196\n00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:23.710\nD column script is not gonna be\nincluded in my file history.\n\n197\n00:10:23.710 --> 00:10:26.870\nSo we can remove items\nfrom our file history.\n\n198\n00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:30.680\nWe can add additional items\nAdd to our file history.\n\n199\n00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:35.584\nThe other thing we can do is we\ncan exclude certain folders which\n\n200\n00:10:35.584 --> 00:10:39.944\nis you know you can make sure\nthat it doesn't get added.\n\n201\n00:10:39.944 --> 00:10:42.890\nOr make sure it's not\nincluded in your back ups.\n\n202\n00:10:42.890 --> 00:10:44.780\nEspecially if it's part of the defaults.\n\n203\n00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:47.579\nMaybe a sub-folder from\nwithin my documents.\n\n204\n00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:52.380\nI know, when I used to have it set\nup to back up my D drive altogether,\n\n205\n00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:54.240\ninstead of just the scripts folder.\n\n206\n00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:59.750\nI wanted to exclude my VM's drive, because\nmy VM's change every time I boot them up.\n\n207\n00:10:59.750 --> 00:11:01.500\nAnd I darn sure don't want it.\n\n208\n00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:04.820\nI don't need file history, at all,\non my virtual hard drives.\n\n209\n00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:07.280\nBecause it would take up a lot of space,\ntake up a lot of time.\n\n210\n00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:08.530\nSo I excluded that folder.\n\n211\n00:11:08.530 --> 00:11:11.050\nI made sure that it wasn't\ngoing to include that.\n\n212\n00:11:11.050 --> 00:11:15.680\n&gt;&gt; Especially in your configuration\nthere usigng a network location so\n\n213\n00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:17.985\nthat's bandwidth that shall\nbe eating up too, right?\n\n214\n00:11:17.985 --> 00:11:19.660\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, absolutely, absolutely.\n\n215\n00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:22.950\nSo you can exclude folders and\nit works the same way.\n\n216\n00:11:22.950 --> 00:11:27.410\nAgain, you just browase and\nfind them, choose that folder.\n\n217\n00:11:27.410 --> 00:11:30.660\nAnd now that folder is\nadded to the exclude list.\n\n218\n00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:33.850\nI can see it, right down there,\nthe colon VMs.\n\n219\n00:11:33.850 --> 00:11:38.560\nNow, I will tell you that I'm in\nplaying around with file history,\n\n220\n00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:42.030\nI have run into a couple of\nissues with this exclude.\n\n221\n00:11:42.030 --> 00:11:45.561\nI've added things to the exclude and\nthen I've remove them.\n\n222\n00:11:45.561 --> 00:11:46.912\nWhich you can come over and say, no,\n\n223\n00:11:46.912 --> 00:11:49.260\nI don't wanna exclude that any more,\nremove it.\n\n224\n00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:51.608\nAnd then go and\nlook at my file history, and\n\n225\n00:11:51.608 --> 00:11:54.162\nit tells me that folder\nis on the exclude list.\n\n226\n00:11:54.162 --> 00:11:56.570\nI cannot add it to your file history.\n\n227\n00:11:56.570 --> 00:11:59.295\nEven though it was\nremoved from the thing so\n\n228\n00:11:59.295 --> 00:12:03.595\nit can be a little bit quirky\nsometimes with that whole exclude.\n\n229\n00:12:03.595 --> 00:12:07.745\nI also might need to change\nwhere I'm backing up to.\n\n230\n00:12:07.745 --> 00:12:10.735\nMaybe I realize I need more space or\n\n231\n00:12:10.735 --> 00:12:13.095\nI don't plug in that\nthumb drive all the time.\n\n232\n00:12:13.095 --> 00:12:17.290\nMaybe I want to move it to a network\nlocation or a different external.\n\n233\n00:12:17.290 --> 00:12:18.390\nHard drive.\n\n234\n00:12:18.390 --> 00:12:21.780\nIf in order to change the location\nis what you're gonna have to do\n\n235\n00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:23.670\nis stop using the current drive.\n\n236\n00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:25.350\nYou can't just change\nto a different drive.\n\n237\n00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:30.115\nYou have to stop using the current drive\nwhich basically turns file history be off.\n\n238\n00:12:30.115 --> 00:12:33.695\nAnd then you're going to go add a drive,\nand add your new drive and\n\n239\n00:12:33.695 --> 00:12:34.665\nit'll set things up again.\n\n240\n00:12:34.665 --> 00:12:38.915\nThe cool thing is that you don't lose\nanything from the current backup.\n\n241\n00:12:38.915 --> 00:12:42.085\nSo the old drive, the drive you\nwere using before you changed,\n\n242\n00:12:42.085 --> 00:12:43.825\nstill has your file history on there.\n\n243\n00:12:43.825 --> 00:12:47.045\nAnd you can browse to it and\nopen that information up and\n\n244\n00:12:47.045 --> 00:12:50.730\nrestore Files from there as well, right?\n\n245\n00:12:51.970 --> 00:12:53.940\nSo, let's see what else\nwe wanna take a look at?\n\n246\n00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:58.600\nSo, those are my general options for\nfile history.\n\n247\n00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:01.850\nAnd I'm towards the bottom here,\nI have Advanced Settings.\n\n248\n00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:05.970\nSo, let's go and click on Advanced\nSettings and see what we've got there.\n\n249\n00:13:05.970 --> 00:13:11.930\nSee, this takes me out to my old school\ncontrol panel, and I can see File History.\n\n250\n00:13:11.930 --> 00:13:15.440\nWe can get a little information\nabout history, it's turned on.\n\n251\n00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:19.750\nTells me when the last run was,\nhow much space I have available.\n\n252\n00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:24.910\nAlso gives me the ability to run now,\nso I can trigger a manual run.\n\n253\n00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:26.500\nI can turn it off.\n\n254\n00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:31.890\nOver here, over on the left\ndrive I've got my Select drive,\n\n255\n00:13:31.890 --> 00:13:35.580\nExclude folders, and\nthen Advanced settings again.\n\n256\n00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:38.510\nLove how Windows does the double\nAdvanced settings here.\n\n257\n00:13:38.510 --> 00:13:41.656\nSo looking at Advanced settings, and\n\n258\n00:13:41.656 --> 00:13:45.895\nnow I can see save copies of files daily,\nforever.\n\n259\n00:13:45.895 --> 00:13:47.810\nAnd notice these\nare the exact same options.\n\n260\n00:13:47.810 --> 00:13:50.630\nBut I have one way,\nwe went through the new UI.\n\n261\n00:13:50.630 --> 00:13:52.680\nHere, we're going through\nthe old school control panel.\n\n262\n00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:55.600\nBut there's only one File History running.\n\n263\n00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:58.430\nThese settings are not,\nwhat's a good way to say it?\n\n264\n00:13:58.430 --> 00:13:59.180\n&gt;&gt; Conflicting?\n\n265\n00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:00.350\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, both places are-\n&gt;&gt; Potentially.\n\n266\n00:14:00.350 --> 00:14:02.010\n&gt;&gt; Changing the same setting, right?\n\n267\n00:14:02.010 --> 00:14:04.650\nSo it's not like I'm\nchanging two different ones.\n\n268\n00:14:04.650 --> 00:14:06.620\nIf the specie was part of a Home Group,\n\n269\n00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:09.850\nI can I recommend this drive\nto other HomeGroup members.\n\n270\n00:14:09.850 --> 00:14:12.490\nSo I can share the File History drive and\n\n271\n00:14:12.490 --> 00:14:16.500\nallow them to use the same drive for\ntheir File History.\n\n272\n00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:18.920\nHere I can get to my\nFile History event logs and\n\n273\n00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:20.950\nmake sure everything is running currently.\n\n274\n00:14:20.950 --> 00:14:22.820\nI also have this clean up version.\n\n275\n00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:26.850\nThis is one I don’t think shows\nup on the other interface, right?\n\n276\n00:14:26.850 --> 00:14:27.602\nThrough the new UI.\n\n277\n00:14:27.602 --> 00:14:31.792\nWe've git Clean up versions and\nI can click this.\n\n278\n00:14:31.792 --> 00:14:34.499\nAnd it'll ask me well how\nfar back do you wanna go,\n\n279\n00:14:34.499 --> 00:14:36.510\nanything that's older than a year.\n\n280\n00:14:36.510 --> 00:14:38.410\nCuz remember [INAUDIBLE] keep foprever.\n\n281\n00:14:38.410 --> 00:14:43.130\nSo two years from now I'll still have\nversions that I can roll back to,\n\n282\n00:14:43.130 --> 00:14:45.230\nassuming I have enough storage space.\n\n283\n00:14:45.230 --> 00:14:46.827\nSo here I can say you know what,\n\n284\n00:14:46.827 --> 00:14:49.843\nanything I haven't rolled back\nto in the last six months.\n\n285\n00:14:49.843 --> 00:14:54.450\nOngoing cleanup and it's going to\nremove those versions of that file.\n\n286\n00:14:55.550 --> 00:14:59.230\nI'll go ahead and cancel on that\nbecause I don't have anything that old.\n\n287\n00:14:59.230 --> 00:15:02.730\nAnd I don't want to delete anything\njust yet out of my file history.\n\n288\n00:15:03.970 --> 00:15:07.010\nAlright, let me cancel out of that...\n\n289\n00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:10.800\nAnd let's take look.\n\n290\n00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:12.950\nI'll go ahead and close this as well.\n\n291\n00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:19.820\nAll right, now I think we got a good\nidea of what file history is.\n\n292\n00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:24.540\nWell, let's take a look at how\nwe actually use file history.\n\n293\n00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:28.700\nSo I have a option right down here\nat the bottom, if we can see that,\n\n294\n00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:31.860\nrestore files from a current backup.\n\n295\n00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:36.175\nAll right, that is gonna take\nme into my file history.\n\n296\n00:15:36.175 --> 00:15:40.610\nAnd it's a really neat little interface\nthat we get when we launch file history.\n\n297\n00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:44.570\nThere's several ways I can get\nto this dialog or this screen.\n\n298\n00:15:44.570 --> 00:15:50.940\nI could go to my start menu,\ntype in file history again.\n\n299\n00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:53.160\nAnd you'll see restore your files.\n\n300\n00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:54.450\nThe file history.\n\n301\n00:15:54.450 --> 00:15:56.009\nSo that's going to get me there.\n\n302\n00:15:56.009 --> 00:15:59.810\nI could also go Windows Explorer.\n\n303\n00:15:59.810 --> 00:16:02.705\nAnd go to my view menu.\n\n304\n00:16:02.705 --> 00:16:06.831\nI think it was my view menu.\n\n305\n00:16:06.831 --> 00:16:09.760\nLet me get on one of my, there we go.\n\n306\n00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:12.520\nCome in here, and I can go to my home.\n\n307\n00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:14.390\nI think I said view, I meant home.\n\n308\n00:16:14.390 --> 00:16:18.390\nAnd I can choose history from here, and\n\n309\n00:16:18.390 --> 00:16:22.370\nthat takes me into my file history,\ntelling me that I can't preview.\n\n310\n00:16:22.370 --> 00:16:27.800\nI think clicked on a markdown file, so\nit doesn't show me a preview for that.\n\n311\n00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:30.050\nThere's several different\nways I can get there,\n\n312\n00:16:30.050 --> 00:16:33.500\nand I should've left one of those ways\nopen so we can actually work with it.\n\n313\n00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:35.150\nSo let me get back into there.\n\n314\n00:16:35.150 --> 00:16:37.120\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I'm having questions, Mike.\n\n315\n00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:37.955\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n316\n00:16:37.955 --> 00:16:38.480\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n317\n00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:39.520\n&gt;&gt; All right, question away.\n\n318\n00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:40.330\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n319\n00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:41.980\nSo how many versions can I go\n\n320\n00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:43.000\nback to?\nCan I?\n\n321\n00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:44.400\n&gt;&gt; Depends on how many you save.\n\n322\n00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:48.200\nI said to save forever, so at this point,\nfrom whenever I turned this on,\n\n323\n00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:52.160\nwhether it was six months ago or a year\nago, I can definitely go back to it.\n\n324\n00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:53.960\n&gt;&gt; Cool.\n&gt;&gt; I have 80 currently.\n\n325\n00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:56.640\nI see up here at the top it says,\nThursday, April 12,\n\n326\n00:16:56.640 --> 00:17:02.140\nwhich was today at 10:58 AM it\ndid the last, that was its daily.\n\n327\n00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:04.660\nRemember, I set my PC to daily.\n\n328\n00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:05.940\nIt says 80 of 80.\n\n329\n00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:07.190\nSo this is the most current one.\n\n330\n00:17:07.190 --> 00:17:10.490\nYou see my navigation buttons down here?\n\n331\n00:17:10.490 --> 00:17:13.050\nThe next one is grayed out because\nthere's nothing further out.\n\n332\n00:17:13.050 --> 00:17:16.460\nThat was just a few minutes ago at\nthe time of the shooting, actually.\n\n333\n00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:20.690\nAnd what it allows me to\ndo is then browse into.\n\n334\n00:17:20.690 --> 00:17:24.880\nLet's say I've got a document that I\nwant to go back to, I can navigate back.\n\n335\n00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:25.535\nWhoa.\n\n336\n00:17:25.535 --> 00:17:26.368\n&gt;&gt; To the beginning of time?\n\n337\n00:17:26.368 --> 00:17:28.855\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Stop, stop, stop.\n\n338\n00:17:28.855 --> 00:17:29.818\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's interesting.\n\n339\n00:17:29.818 --> 00:17:30.570\n&gt;&gt; Almost 64 of 80.\n\n340\n00:17:30.570 --> 00:17:36.192\n&gt;&gt; So I went all the way back to\nWednesday, April 4th, interesting.\n\n341\n00:17:36.192 --> 00:17:41.260\nAll right, let's get back to today,\nand try that one more time.\n\n342\n00:17:42.730 --> 00:17:43.580\nThere we go.\n\n343\n00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:46.170\nThat's what it's supposed to\ndo is only go back one screen.\n\n344\n00:17:46.170 --> 00:17:48.857\nI don't know why it\nwent back to April 4th.\n\n345\n00:17:48.857 --> 00:17:52.517\nBut normally when you click on this,\nit goes back, and\n\n346\n00:17:52.517 --> 00:17:55.563\nI can see there's April 11 at 10:58.\n\n347\n00:17:55.563 --> 00:18:00.190\nIf I go back one more there's, I was\nplaying around with some manual creations,\n\n348\n00:18:00.190 --> 00:18:02.800\nso you'll see a few extra snapshots here.\n\n349\n00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:04.935\nLet me get past the 11th.\n\n350\n00:18:04.935 --> 00:18:10.950\nThere's the 10th at 9:12,\nthe 9th at 9:11, the 8th at 8:37 PM.\n\n351\n00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:13.590\n&gt;&gt; This is pretty cool.\n\n352\n00:18:13.590 --> 00:18:15.082\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and so\nI can go back through here.\n\n353\n00:18:15.082 --> 00:18:20.229\nAnd if I go, I know I updated\nthis file on the 6th of April or\n\n354\n00:18:20.229 --> 00:18:23.710\nlast Friday I made those changes to it.\n\n355\n00:18:23.710 --> 00:18:27.450\nSo I'm gonna go back to Thursday, and\n\n356\n00:18:27.450 --> 00:18:31.349\nnow I can just navigate in here wherever\nthat file was stored, documents.\n\n357\n00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:37.550\nAnd then find that document, and I can\ndouble click on it and I can get a preview\n\n358\n00:18:37.550 --> 00:18:41.890\nof that document to see if that is\nindeed the version that I want.\n\n359\n00:18:41.890 --> 00:18:45.320\nAnd if it wasn't, I'll go back and\n\n360\n00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:49.892\nI simply browse to another day and\nfind that document,\n\n361\n00:18:49.892 --> 00:18:54.490\nand go yeah, there's the version of\nthat document that I wanna restore.\n\n362\n00:18:54.490 --> 00:18:57.844\n&gt;&gt; So we don't have to like, roll back\nour entire operating system and all,\n\n363\n00:18:57.844 --> 00:18:58.740\neverything.\n\n364\n00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:00.570\n&gt;&gt; No, and\nthat's the great thing about this, and\n\n365\n00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:02.590\nthis is something that an end user can do.\n\n366\n00:19:04.090 --> 00:19:06.180\nI don't have to worry about it,\nthey don't have to come to me, and\n\n367\n00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:08.590\nI have to break out backup tapes and\nthings like that.\n\n368\n00:19:08.590 --> 00:19:12.020\nAn end user can recover\ntheir own files using this.\n\n369\n00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:15.760\nNavigation wise, again, left,\nright to move between my days.\n\n370\n00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:18.890\nNow that I've doubled clicked,\nif you look at my address bar up here,\n\n371\n00:19:18.890 --> 00:19:23.920\nyou'll see I'm now in SQL and users,\nMichael's documents, Facebook.\n\n372\n00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:26.240\nSo I have these little\nnavigation guys up here.\n\n373\n00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:30.050\nI can go up one level back into documents.\n\n374\n00:19:30.050 --> 00:19:32.510\nNow you might notice\nthat the date changed.\n\n375\n00:19:32.510 --> 00:19:35.740\nIt's a little twisty sometimes\nwhen you're navigating in here.\n\n376\n00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:39.643\nLet me go back up one, so\nnotice I'm back to March 30th.\n\n377\n00:19:39.643 --> 00:19:44.100\nIt's like, wait, weren't you on\nApril 5th or 6th when you went in?\n\n378\n00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:45.275\nHow did you get back to March 30th?\n\n379\n00:19:46.930 --> 00:19:50.650\nAnd let's jump forward a little\nbit here and try that again.\n\n380\n00:19:52.250 --> 00:19:55.390\nSo, I'll go back to,\nI think we were on April 5th, so\n\n381\n00:19:55.390 --> 00:19:56.890\nwe'll keep it consistent here,\nthere we go.\n\n382\n00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:01.640\nSo this is a snapshot that occurred\nThursday, April 5th at 09:54 AM.\n\n383\n00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:04.565\nSo I double-click on documents.\n\n384\n00:20:06.455 --> 00:20:08.295\nAnd notice it's switched-\n&gt;&gt; Can I guess?\n\n385\n00:20:08.295 --> 00:20:09.595\n&gt;&gt; Days, too, yes.\n\n386\n00:20:09.595 --> 00:20:12.875\n&gt;&gt; Okay, that was the,\nno that would be wrong.\n\n387\n00:20:12.875 --> 00:20:14.210\n[LAUGH] Because I was\ngoing to say that was the-\n\n388\n00:20:14.210 --> 00:20:15.239\n&gt;&gt; Well, you didn't guess.\n\n389\n00:20:15.239 --> 00:20:17.107\n&gt;&gt; Okay, cuz I'm like reasoning out.\n\n390\n00:20:17.107 --> 00:20:21.788\nI was thinking maybe that's the day\nthat the file was created, but\n\n391\n00:20:21.788 --> 00:20:22.914\nthen-\n&gt;&gt; Or?\n\n392\n00:20:22.914 --> 00:20:23.860\n&gt;&gt; Modified?\n&gt;&gt; Modified.\n\n393\n00:20:23.860 --> 00:20:24.730\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n394\n00:20:24.730 --> 00:20:31.710\nSo remember, it's only getting a snapshot\nor capturing the files that have changed.\n\n395\n00:20:31.710 --> 00:20:36.050\nSo when I double click on my documents, if\nnothing in my documents has changed since\n\n396\n00:20:36.050 --> 00:20:40.000\na week ago,\nthat date is gonna change up there.\n\n397\n00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:41.830\nIt's gonna go back to a week ago,\n\n398\n00:20:41.830 --> 00:20:45.900\nto the latest version of\nthose particular documents.\n\n399\n00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:47.280\nSo that's why when I click on this file,\n\n400\n00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:50.570\nit actually goes back\nto Friday March 30th,\n\n401\n00:20:50.570 --> 00:20:55.620\ncuz that's the day I created it actually,\nand I haven't changed it since then.\n\n402\n00:20:55.620 --> 00:20:57.710\nBut understand,\nthat's not always the creation date,\n\n403\n00:20:57.710 --> 00:21:01.060\nthat's the date of the last\nmodification to that file.\n\n404\n00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:04.660\nAnd that's why I say it's really easy to\nget confused in here, because you double\n\n405\n00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:08.200\nclick on one file, you look at it,\nyou go, that's not the one I want, and\n\n406\n00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:14.420\nmaybe use your Up button.\n\n407\n00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:16.060\nIt leaves me at the 30th, right?\n\n408\n00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:17.820\nIt didn't take me back to the date-\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n409\n00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:20.560\njust be aware of where you are at,\nchronologically.\n\n410\n00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:22.590\n&gt;&gt; Yes, really easy to get confused.\n\n411\n00:21:22.590 --> 00:21:24.310\nBecause if I use the Back button, well,\n\n412\n00:21:24.310 --> 00:21:27.500\nthis is where I drilled in\nto that file from April 4th.\n\n413\n00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:31.000\nI double clicked on the file, it's March\n30th cuz it's the last version of it.\n\n414\n00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:34.840\nWhen I click back,\nit goes back to Wednesday, April 4th.\n\n415\n00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:38.710\nBut if I click up,\nit's staying on the same day, but\n\n416\n00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:41.960\ngoing up in the directory,\nin the hierarchy of the files.\n\n417\n00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:43.980\nSo it's good that we have both options.\n\n418\n00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:45.850\nIt's just that you've got to pay\nattention to what you're doing.\n\n419\n00:21:45.850 --> 00:21:49.720\nIt's really easy to get lost in here,\nfigure out where you are.\n\n420\n00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:53.762\nAll of a sudden you're back to some\ndate from last year, and you're like,\n\n421\n00:21:53.762 --> 00:21:55.470\nhow did I get here?\n\n422\n00:21:55.470 --> 00:21:59.240\nOnce you find that file, in fact,\nlet's go find that file.\n\n423\n00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:03.870\nI'm going to go into documents.\n\n424\n00:22:03.870 --> 00:22:05.780\nWhat'd I call that one, Facebook?\n\n425\n00:22:05.780 --> 00:22:07.090\n&gt;&gt; What if you had deleted that file?\n\n426\n00:22:07.090 --> 00:22:09.010\nWould it still reside in your backup?\n\n427\n00:22:09.010 --> 00:22:09.760\n&gt;&gt; I just deleted it.\n\n428\n00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:10.960\n&gt;&gt; He just deleted it [LAUGH].\n\n429\n00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:12.210\n&gt;&gt; No, what am I ever going to do?\n\n430\n00:22:12.210 --> 00:22:15.310\nAll right, so I'm gonna close everything,\nit was like, no.\n\n431\n00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:19.470\nAnd Cherokee says, hey, do you still have\nthat document where you were listing out\n\n432\n00:22:19.470 --> 00:22:23.840\nsome of the things we wanted to talk about\nfor that Facebook video we're gonna shoot?\n\n433\n00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:28.110\nI just deleted that, Cherokee, and\nI wiped my recycle bin, so sorry.\n\n434\n00:22:28.110 --> 00:22:30.575\nWait, I can go into file history.\n\n435\n00:22:30.575 --> 00:22:35.331\nSo let's go over to file history.\n\n436\n00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:43.600\nAnd let's see if it's in here.\n\n437\n00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:44.840\nThere it is.\n\n438\n00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:48.423\nIt's deleted from my documents, but\nhere it is my history from 10:58 AM.\n\n439\n00:22:48.423 --> 00:22:53.190\nThat was 30 minutes ago when\nthe file still was there.\n\n440\n00:22:53.190 --> 00:22:55.790\nSo all I have to do is\nI can again preview it,\n\n441\n00:22:55.790 --> 00:22:57.720\nmake sure it's the version that I want.\n\n442\n00:22:59.590 --> 00:23:02.010\nAnd I jumped the dates again.\n\n443\n00:23:02.010 --> 00:23:03.960\nAnd it wouldn't matter,\nit's all the same version.\n\n444\n00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:07.870\nOnce I decide that is the version that\nI want, I simply click this Restore,\n\n445\n00:23:10.390 --> 00:23:13.410\nand here it is,\nit's back in all of its glory.\n\n446\n00:23:13.410 --> 00:23:17.550\nAnd it's that easy to\nwork with file history.\n\n447\n00:23:17.550 --> 00:23:23.989\nAgain, you can also select,\nmaybe this file is here, let's do this.\n\n448\n00:23:27.350 --> 00:23:27.981\nAnd I'm going to save it.\n\n449\n00:23:31.358 --> 00:23:32.560\nAnd close it.\n\n450\n00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:34.418\nAnd when I go back and\nlook at that file, I'm like,\n\n451\n00:23:34.418 --> 00:23:36.830\nwait, what happened to\nthe rest of my file?\n\n452\n00:23:36.830 --> 00:23:39.230\nI know I had more in here.\n\n453\n00:23:39.230 --> 00:23:41.550\nWell, I can simply select that file.\n\n454\n00:23:41.550 --> 00:23:46.670\nYou can even right click on it and\nchoose Restore Previous Versions.\n\n455\n00:23:46.670 --> 00:23:50.160\nAnd I can see some versions here, but\nwe'll save that for another show, I guess.\n\n456\n00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:51.690\nI better stick with File History.\n\n457\n00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:59.310\nI can select it, and then go up to\nmy Home ribbon, and choose History.\n\n458\n00:23:59.310 --> 00:24:02.345\nAll right, and\nit goes right to that document and\n\n459\n00:24:02.345 --> 00:24:05.530\nnotice that all those\ntexts are still there.\n\n460\n00:24:05.530 --> 00:24:08.330\nSo now I can click restore, and\n\n461\n00:24:08.330 --> 00:24:11.040\nI will replace the destination model,\nthis is kind of cool.\n\n462\n00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:14.250\nWhat if I wanted the turned\nversion the way it is, but\n\n463\n00:24:14.250 --> 00:24:16.950\nI still want that old version\nas an another copy of the files?\n\n464\n00:24:16.950 --> 00:24:20.810\nSo, maybe I wanna look at them side by\nside or print them both out, or something\n\n465\n00:24:20.810 --> 00:24:26.610\nlike that I could skip or compare info and\nyou guys know how this works, right?\n\n466\n00:24:26.610 --> 00:24:29.450\nIf I compare info and\nI choose both of them,\n\n467\n00:24:29.450 --> 00:24:32.530\nit will name one with a little 1\nafter it or something like that.\n\n468\n00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:39.400\nOr I can simply replace the file, in my\ncase somebody deleted half my document,\n\n469\n00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:42.870\nso I wanna replace it with\nthe previous version.\n\n470\n00:24:42.870 --> 00:24:43.710\nAnd there we go.\n\n471\n00:24:43.710 --> 00:24:46.480\nI'm back in business, all my text is back.\n\n472\n00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:49.740\nThe final history is\na pretty cool technology.\n\n473\n00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:55.220\nGives me the ability again, to look at\nthose points in time of those documents.\n\n474\n00:24:55.220 --> 00:24:59.820\nDoes it automatically,\nit's really convenient, all right?\n\n475\n00:24:59.820 --> 00:25:06.303\nNow that I've said that, I guess I\nshould show you guys the bad news.\n\n476\n00:25:06.303 --> 00:25:07.321\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n477\n00:25:07.321 --> 00:25:08.540\n&gt;&gt; Well, I shouldn't say that.\n\n478\n00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:11.920\nI've read a couple of conflicting things.\n\n479\n00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:16.370\nYou guys know we take Microsoft's\nobjectives as we prepare these episodes so\n\n480\n00:25:16.370 --> 00:25:17.470\nthat you can pass the exam.\n\n481\n00:25:17.470 --> 00:25:20.520\nAnd that's really what we're trying to do,\nis help you pass these exams.\n\n482\n00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:23.040\nWe also wanna make sure we're\nteaching the current content and\n\n483\n00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:25.050\nwhat is currently available.\n\n484\n00:25:25.050 --> 00:25:29.550\nAnd that sometimes is not the same,\n[LAUGH] right?\n\n485\n00:25:29.550 --> 00:25:31.490\nWhat the objectives say and\nwhat is current.\n\n486\n00:25:31.490 --> 00:25:34.430\nSo we do really have to keep that in mind.\n\n487\n00:25:34.430 --> 00:25:36.730\nFile history is on the exam objectives.\n\n488\n00:25:36.730 --> 00:25:40.760\nYou need to understand how file history\nworks, the options, how we configure it,\n\n489\n00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:44.400\nwhat I can do with it, what its\nlimitations are, things like that.\n\n490\n00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:46.320\nNow that being said,\n\n491\n00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:51.120\nthe latest I've read is that file\nhistory is going to be going away.\n\n492\n00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:52.350\nWell, that's gonna happen, right?\n\n493\n00:25:52.350 --> 00:25:56.910\nAt the time of shooting,\nwherein March, April of 2018,\n\n494\n00:25:56.910 --> 00:26:01.600\nthe Spring Creators Update should be\ncoming out right around the corner.\n\n495\n00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:05.000\nRumor is that, history won't be in there\n\n496\n00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:08.130\nbecause Microsoft is coming out\nwith something known as timeline.\n\n497\n00:26:08.130 --> 00:26:11.380\nNow that's gonna give me these\nsame capabilities and others.\n\n498\n00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:15.000\nSo there's no need to have two\ntechnologies that are doing\n\n499\n00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:16.580\nthe same thing.\n\n500\n00:26:16.580 --> 00:26:19.790\nThis has happened before though,\nback in the first, I think\n\n501\n00:26:19.790 --> 00:26:24.820\nit was the Fall Creators Update, File\nHistory went away, and then it came back.\n\n502\n00:26:24.820 --> 00:26:27.790\nNow there was all rumblings about,\nit's going away, it's not gonna be there,\n\n503\n00:26:27.790 --> 00:26:28.789\nMicrosoft took it away.\n\n504\n00:26:30.260 --> 00:26:34.390\nThere were people that take a look at\nthe preview edition or the insiders.\n\n505\n00:26:34.390 --> 00:26:38.660\nAnd they look at all possible error\nversus they found dialog boxes\n\n506\n00:26:38.660 --> 00:26:42.715\nthat could potentially pop up and\nsay this feature is no longer supported.\n\n507\n00:26:42.715 --> 00:26:47.475\nSo from that, they inferred that\nMicrosoft is getting rid of history.\n\n508\n00:26:47.475 --> 00:26:52.245\nAnd the reason I bring this is up is if\nyou're watching this video six months from\n\n509\n00:26:52.245 --> 00:26:55.285\nnow, you've got the latest and\ngreatest build of Windows 10 and\n\n510\n00:26:55.285 --> 00:26:59.100\nyou're studying for the exam,\nyou might not see file history at all.\n\n511\n00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:00.490\nOr you might, I don't know.\n\n512\n00:27:00.490 --> 00:27:05.090\nSo just understand that it is\na feature that might be going away.\n\n513\n00:27:05.090 --> 00:27:06.848\nIt's still important to study up for\nit for the exam.\n\n514\n00:27:06.848 --> 00:27:08.023\n&gt;&gt; We're not just trying to gossip.\n\n515\n00:27:08.023 --> 00:27:08.551\n&gt;&gt; What's that?\n\n516\n00:27:08.551 --> 00:27:09.725\n&gt;&gt; We're not just trying to gossip.\n\n517\n00:27:09.725 --> 00:27:11.662\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; That's another show.\n\n518\n00:27:11.662 --> 00:27:12.189\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n519\n00:27:12.189 --> 00:27:13.944\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n520\n00:27:13.944 --> 00:27:16.380\nI think we have hit\neverything we need to do.\n\n521\n00:27:16.380 --> 00:27:22.705\nWe have looked at recovering files with\nthe previous versions of those files.\n\n522\n00:27:22.705 --> 00:27:26.410\nAs we got a little time, Cherokee?\n\n523\n00:27:26.410 --> 00:27:27.270\n&gt;&gt; A little bit.\n\n524\n00:27:27.270 --> 00:27:33.569\n&gt;&gt; All right, a couple of other options or\nsome things I want to show you.\n\n525\n00:27:33.569 --> 00:27:38.453\nIf I open up a command prompt here,\nthere is something known\n\n526\n00:27:38.453 --> 00:27:44.090\nas fhmanagew, and if I hit Enter I\nget a whole lot of nothing.\n\n527\n00:27:44.090 --> 00:27:50.640\nIf I say fhmanagewswitch?,\nI get a whole lot of nothing.\n\n528\n00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:52.666\nSo is it a command or isn't it?\n\n529\n00:27:52.666 --> 00:27:53.799\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n\n530\n00:27:53.799 --> 00:28:00.152\n[LAUGH] Fhmanagew, and\nyou can do a dash cleanup\n\n531\n00:28:01.782 --> 00:28:05.817\nAnd then say, 30, all right?\n\n532\n00:28:05.817 --> 00:28:09.986\nAnd what this is doing is it's gonna\nremove any file history older than\n\n533\n00:28:09.986 --> 00:28:10.700\n30 days.\n\n534\n00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:11.530\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n535\n00:28:11.530 --> 00:28:12.110\n&gt;&gt; So I hit enter.\n\n536\n00:28:13.380 --> 00:28:17.620\nI have apps that are using File History,\nso let's close Windows Explore and\n\n537\n00:28:17.620 --> 00:28:19.309\nmy File History and all that good stuff.\n\n538\n00:28:20.610 --> 00:28:24.667\nAnd let's try that one more time,\nall right?\n\n539\n00:28:24.667 --> 00:28:28.065\nIn says, we didn't find any versions\nof your files were that old so\n\n540\n00:28:28.065 --> 00:28:30.060\nchoose a shorter time period.\n\n541\n00:28:30.060 --> 00:28:34.160\nSo you can choose, you can say older\nthan ten days older than 365 days.\n\n542\n00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:38.182\nRemember we had that link within\nthe GUI that said clean up files.\n\n543\n00:28:38.182 --> 00:28:41.314\nAnd we had drop-down lists where\nwe could pick dates and say, look,\n\n544\n00:28:41.314 --> 00:28:43.090\nwipe out anything that's older.\n\n545\n00:28:43.090 --> 00:28:46.650\nThis is just the command line, this is\nwhat's actually running in the background\n\n546\n00:28:46.650 --> 00:28:48.210\nwhen you use that GUI interface.\n\n547\n00:28:48.210 --> 00:28:49.350\nI wanted to show you that.\n\n548\n00:28:49.350 --> 00:28:52.360\nI doubt they would ask\nyou on the exam about it.\n\n549\n00:28:52.360 --> 00:28:55.430\nThere are a couple of other\nswitches that go with this.\n\n550\n00:28:58.140 --> 00:29:01.170\nAnd now, for the life of me,\nI can't think of what they are.\n\n551\n00:29:01.170 --> 00:29:02.830\nIt's not documented by Microsoft.\n\n552\n00:29:02.830 --> 00:29:05.310\nIf you go look at Microsoft\ndocumentation at least for\n\n553\n00:29:05.310 --> 00:29:07.450\nwhat I found were this particular command.\n\n554\n00:29:07.450 --> 00:29:09.480\nThe only-\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n555\n00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:12.712\nyou introduced me to it, I never heard\nof it before like, uh-huh, okay.\n\n556\n00:29:12.712 --> 00:29:17.020\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH] and the only\nswitch they mentioned is -cleanup.\n\n557\n00:29:17.020 --> 00:29:21.820\nBut I was reading the gentleman's\nblog he used strings.xe that\n\n558\n00:29:21.820 --> 00:29:26.650\nlooked through the binaries and\nfind other strings,\n\n559\n00:29:26.650 --> 00:29:28.730\nand he did find other switches\nthat are available in there.\n\n560\n00:29:28.730 --> 00:29:30.913\nAnd we're not gonna go into it because\nit's definitely not gonna be in the-\n\n561\n00:29:30.913 --> 00:29:31.710\n&gt;&gt; Obviously,\n\n562\n00:29:31.710 --> 00:29:33.742\nthat's buried that far deep in.\n\n563\n00:29:33.742 --> 00:29:36.922\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but I did want you to\nknow that this is available,\n\n564\n00:29:36.922 --> 00:29:39.570\ncuz this is something I could script,\nright?\n\n565\n00:29:39.570 --> 00:29:42.980\nI could write a script,\nI could put a shortcut on my desktop, and\n\n566\n00:29:42.980 --> 00:29:46.050\nI could double click it any time I wanted\nto delete my file history older than ten\n\n567\n00:29:46.050 --> 00:29:47.500\ndays or whatever I set it to.\n\n568\n00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:48.935\nSo I thought I'd point that out-\n&gt;&gt; That is cool.\n\n569\n00:29:48.935 --> 00:29:49.748\n&gt;&gt; To you.\n\n570\n00:29:49.748 --> 00:29:52.930\nAnd with that Cherokee,\nI think does it for file history.\n\n571\n00:29:52.930 --> 00:29:54.580\n&gt;&gt; Okay, cool,\nwell thank you so much, Mike.\n\n572\n00:29:54.580 --> 00:29:57.420\nAnd thank you for joining us as well,\nbut let's sign out.\n\n573\n00:29:57.420 --> 00:29:58.704\nI've been your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n574\n00:29:58.704 --> 00:29:59.610\n&gt;&gt;

You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.935 --> 00:00:16.278\n&gt;&gt; Welcome everyone to your configure\nWindows devices series, studying up for\n\n6\n00:00:16.278 --> 00:00:18.170\nthat 70-697 exam.\n\n7\n00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:19.870\nI'm your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n8\n00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:23.020\nIn this episode, we'll take a look\nat how we can configure and\n\n9\n00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:24.640\nmanage our Window's updates.\n\n10\n00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.400\nAnd of course, with us today,\nback in studios, we have Mr Mike Rodrick.\n\n11\n00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:29.600\nHow's it going today, Mike?\n\n12\n00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:30.390\n&gt;&gt; It's going great, Cherokee.\n\n13\n00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.100\nThanks for having me back,\nexcited as always.\n\n14\n00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.080\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And, yeah, Window's updates.\n\n15\n00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:35.751\n[SOUND] This ought to be fun?\n\n16\n00:00:35.751 --> 00:00:40.652\n[LAUGH] You know if you've been working\nwith Windows at all over the last six\n\n17\n00:00:40.652 --> 00:00:44.460\nmonths, a year, with Windows 10-\n&gt;&gt; You know what we're talking about.\n\n18\n00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.220\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the updates have changed\njust a little bit, right.\n\n19\n00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:51.980\nDefinitely revamping the entire system,\nthe way we get our updates.\n\n20\n00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:53.714\nSo basically what I want to do for this,\n\n21\n00:00:53.714 --> 00:00:56.251\nthere's certain objectives\nthey call out on this exam.\n\n22\n00:00:56.251 --> 00:00:58.245\nSome of those objectives might or\n\n23\n00:00:58.245 --> 00:01:02.690\nmight not still apply because of\nthe changes they've made to this.\n\n24\n00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:04.860\nSo really what you're gonna have\nto do as you're preparing for\n\n25\n00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.520\nthis exam is you gotta open up Windows\n10 and play and look at the options and\n\n26\n00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.930\nmake sure you're familiar\nwith what options are there.\n\n27\n00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.480\nHopefully on the exam they won't get\nyou with anything that's brand new that\n\n28\n00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:20.200\nyou haven't had a chance to see yet.\n\n29\n00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.090\nBut again, it's changing fast.\n\n30\n00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.130\nSo check out the documentation\non docs.microsoft.com.\n\n31\n00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.360\nMake sure you open up, do what we're\ngetting ready to do here, open up\n\n32\n00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.622\nWindows Updates and just go through all of\nthe settings and understand what they are.\n\n33\n00:01:33.622 --> 00:01:38.330\nWell we'll talk more about WSUS,\nand we'll explain what it is.\n\n34\n00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.140\nBut we'll go through configurations and\nthings like that in our server side.\n\n35\n00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.920\nHere we're just gonna focus\nreally what the end user sees and\n\n36\n00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.050\nwhat I might have to do to help an end\nuser working on a Windows 10 machine.\n\n37\n00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:50.022\nAll right, so let's start.\n\n38\n00:01:50.022 --> 00:01:54.079\nWe talk about updates and obviously\nI think most of us out here probably\n\n39\n00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:59.119\nfamiliar with updates because we've been\ndoing it ever since we've had a PC, right.\n\n40\n00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:02.870\nWe gotta go out and get our updates,\nput an operating system out.\n\n41\n00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:06.330\nThey find flaws in the operating system.\n\n42\n00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.420\nThey have to put out updates or\npatches for that.\n\n43\n00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.540\nMaybe a security\nvulnerability comes to light,\n\n44\n00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.890\nthey want to patch that to keep us safe.\n\n45\n00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.270\nOr maybe the want to add\nnew functionality, right.\n\n46\n00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.880\nThey've added something new,\na new feature.\n\n47\n00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.240\nAll of that comes to us\nvia Windows updates.\n\n48\n00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.060\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Drivers, right, when a vendor puts out\n\n49\n00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.900\na new product or updates their driver,\nthey can submit that to Microsoft,\n\n50\n00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.460\nhave it go through its paces, and make\nthat available through Windows updates.\n\n51\n00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:37.720\nWe keep our systems current and\nsecure by applying Windows updates.\n\n52\n00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.430\nAnd it's all done,\nit should be set up to be automatic.\n\n53\n00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.650\nIt's not something that we want to have to\nremember to do because if we forget and\n\n54\n00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.650\nwe skip some updates, we can be putting\nourselves at risk for no reason.\n\n55\n00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.180\nThere's an update available that could\nbe patching a very serious security\n\n56\n00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:59.320\nvulnerability and because you forgot to\ncheck for updates for the last two weeks,\n\n57\n00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:03.230\nyour system is vulnerable and\nit didn't have to be, right.\n\n58\n00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:07.049\nIn a corporate environment, most likely,\nthey will force those updates and\n\n59\n00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:08.706\nwill give you a chance to forget.\n\n60\n00:03:08.706 --> 00:03:11.900\nBut again, let's just go through\nthe options and see what we've got.\n\n61\n00:03:13.032 --> 00:03:14.720\nAll right, so\nI'm on my Windows 10 machine here.\n\n62\n00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.470\nI'm actually on my physical machine so\nwe can have a look at what's going on.\n\n63\n00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:24.020\nI'm gonna go to my Start menu,\nI'm gonna click on my little gear icon.\n\n64\n00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:28.440\nAnd in my Windows Settings I have\na section for Update and Security, and\n\n65\n00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:29.840\nthat's where we're gonna head.\n\n66\n00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.210\nI can also go to my Start menu and\ntype in Windows Updates.\n\n67\n00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:38.310\nAnd you can see I can get\nthere just as easily.\n\n68\n00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.110\nSo we'll click on Update and Security.\n\n69\n00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:41.500\nAnd this is where we start.\n\n70\n00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.690\nIt tells me what my current status is.\n\n71\n00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:45.840\nI can see my device as up to date.\n\n72\n00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.950\nLast checked at 8:08am.\n\n73\n00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:48.760\n&gt;&gt; Good job, Mike.\n\n74\n00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:49.360\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, thank you.\n\n75\n00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.980\nI remember.\n\n76\n00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.610\nNo, that was done automatically.\n\n77\n00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:52.460\nI didn't do that.\n\n78\n00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:56.480\nWindows did that when I\nturned on my machine.\n\n79\n00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.740\nBut I do have the option to\nmanually check for updates.\n\n80\n00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:02.850\nSo I can click check for\nupdates, it's gonna go out and\n\n81\n00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:04.590\nsee if there's any updates available.\n\n82\n00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.660\nWe'll give it just a second to kinda\nrun through it's paces here, and\n\n83\n00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:11.220\nit should tell me,\nsince it just checked at 8:08,\n\n84\n00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:14.460\nmost likely I don't have any updates but\nyou never know, right.\n\n85\n00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:18.250\nA Windows Defender update, that's another\nthing that comes through Windows updates\n\n86\n00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:23.510\nis our antivirus definitions for\nour Windows Defender, keeps us safe.\n\n87\n00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:24.220\nSo let that run, but\n\n88\n00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:28.210\nwhat it's doing right now by default,\nit's reaching out to Microsoft servers.\n\n89\n00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:30.390\nMicrosoft has their update servers.\n\n90\n00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:32.360\nMy machine is reaching\nout to those servers.\n\n91\n00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.000\nSo I do need Internet access for this.\n\n92\n00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.190\nAnd it's going to, and there we go,\n\n93\n00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:41.680\nwe can actually see it is picking up\nsome Windows Defender definitions.\n\n94\n00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.880\nGreat, and one of my cumulative updates\n\n95\n00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:45.985\nthat somehow-\n&gt;&gt; What?\n\n96\n00:04:45.985 --> 00:04:48.580\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\neven though it told me it was up to date,\n\n97\n00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.580\nthis is-\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n\n98\n00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:54.280\n&gt;&gt; The update system is going\nthrough some major changes and\n\n99\n00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:56.320\nit does behave a little quirky.\n\n100\n00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:01.580\nSo even though I was up to date as of 8:00\nthis morning, I'm now going back to March.\n\n101\n00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:04.810\nIt is April fourth, fifth, I'm sorry.\n\n102\n00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:05.680\nSo I'm going back and\n\n103\n00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.920\ngetting the March cumulative\nupdate that somehow I didn't get.\n\n104\n00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:13.170\nAgain, the Windows update system,\nit'll drive you crazy.\n\n105\n00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:15.226\nBut it is good and\nit does what it's supposed to.\n\n106\n00:05:15.226 --> 00:05:17.500\n&gt;&gt; Right, we don't think traditionally.\n\n107\n00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:23.470\nAnd I think that's kind of a myth\nwith the whole patch Tuesday.\n\n108\n00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:27.540\nThat's not really adhered to anymore\nbecause they're on this more of\n\n109\n00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:32.400\na revolving update cycle and\npushing them out on an as needed basis.\n\n110\n00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.610\nEspecially for those hot fixes there, so.\n\n111\n00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:35.630\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; You don't know.\n\n112\n00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:39.970\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, I think Jim in the chat\nroom was just saying something about that.\n\n113\n00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:44.370\nHow he had a machine that says it's up to\ndate and you do manual check and there's\n\n114\n00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:47.370\nan update from ten days ago that somehow-\n&gt;&gt; Was missed.\n\n115\n00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:48.680\n&gt;&gt; Is now getting pushed\nout to the system.\n\n116\n00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:51.810\nSo there you go, perfect demonstration\nof what Jim was talking about-\n\n117\n00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:52.980\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, he says, welcome to the club.\n\n118\n00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:53.770\n&gt;&gt; In the chatroom.\n\n119\n00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:57.200\nYeah, so hopefully it won't\nbog my system down to bad.\n\n120\n00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:01.595\nSometimes these updates are large,\nthese cumulative updates can be big,\n\n121\n00:06:01.595 --> 00:06:05.150\neats up a lot of disk IO as it's\ndownloading that update, and\n\n122\n00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:08.000\nthen prepares to install the update.\n\n123\n00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.470\nHopefully I won't have to stop\nthe show and let it finish that.\n\n124\n00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:12.740\nWe can actually see the process.\n\n125\n00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:16.417\nSo [COUGH] anyway,\nback to what we were saying.\n\n126\n00:06:16.417 --> 00:06:19.670\nMy machine is reaching out to Microsoft,\nand it's saying, hey,\n\n127\n00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:22.470\nI am a Windows 10 machine,\nhere's my current status.\n\n128\n00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:25.600\nThis is my build,\nthese are the updates I have installed.\n\n129\n00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:27.780\nAnd then Windows is letting\nmy machine know whether or\n\n130\n00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:32.830\nnot there's any new updates that\nneed to be or should be installed.\n\n131\n00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:37.420\nAnd then it returns a list to my machine,\nand you can see it begins downloading.\n\n132\n00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:40.150\nAnd my download has\nactually gone backwards.\n\n133\n00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:40.680\nIt was at 90.\n\n134\n00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:42.170\n&gt;&gt; No, that was preparing.\n\n135\n00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:44.550\n&gt;&gt; That was my preparing to download,\nyeah.\n\n136\n00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:46.730\nOkay, so it is going.\n\n137\n00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:49.970\nI do like that they've changed\nthis screen a little bit, right.\n\n138\n00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:53.930\nWe get a little information about each\nupdate, a little status which is nice.\n\n139\n00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:58.445\nPrevious, just a few months ago, all\nyou saw was the name of the updates and\n\n140\n00:06:58.445 --> 00:07:01.887\nyou were kinda left wondering\nwhich one is it working on,\n\n141\n00:07:01.887 --> 00:07:04.630\nwhich one is it hung up on,\nwhat's going on.\n\n142\n00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:08.460\nSo at least now they do give\nus a little more information.\n\n143\n00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:09.430\nAll right, so we'll let that run.\n\n144\n00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:13.135\nNext thing I want to take\na look at is the view install,\n\n145\n00:07:13.135 --> 00:07:15.860\nwe're just gonna kind of work our\nway down through all these options\n\n146\n00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:18.160\ncuz it really a maze at this point.\n\n147\n00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:23.110\nBut view installed update history\nshows me what updates I've installed.\n\n148\n00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:24.540\nMake sense, right?\n\n149\n00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:27.280\nAnd this is where you can go if\nyou've come back to your machine it's\n\n150\n00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:31.000\nbeen rebooted and it says Windows\nhas recently installed an update.\n\n151\n00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.960\nYou wanna know what that update was,\nwhat it was for, why you needed it.\n\n152\n00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:39.094\nYou can come in here and you can click on\nthese links, and it will take you out.\n\n153\n00:07:39.094 --> 00:07:41.459\nHere's one, I'll click on this one.\n\n154\n00:07:41.459 --> 00:07:47.254\nIt takes me out to support.microsoft.com,\nand here's some information,\n\n155\n00:07:47.254 --> 00:07:52.626\nthe KB, about that particular update,\nright, and what it was fixing.\n\n156\n00:07:52.626 --> 00:07:57.412\nI don't know if they still give me\nActual manual download link but\n\n157\n00:07:57.412 --> 00:08:02.980\nif you're curious to see what that update\nwas and why your system needed it,\n\n158\n00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:06.990\nyou can go out and\nget a little bit more information.\n\n159\n00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:08.410\n&gt;&gt; Right.\nEspecially if it's something that's\n\n160\n00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:11.120\nnot even applicable to\nyour systems at all.\n\n161\n00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:12.760\nThen there's really no point.\n\n162\n00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:14.140\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah exactly.\n\n163\n00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:18.090\nDriver updates I can see down here,\nI've had a couple of updates,\n\n164\n00:08:18.090 --> 00:08:19.570\nthese look like they were last year.\n\n165\n00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:23.510\nI take that back,\nthat was back in February.\n\n166\n00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:29.680\nOther updates, so again, all of\nthe updates that you have installed.\n\n167\n00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:34.670\nNow at the top of this screen there\nis an option to uninstall updates.\n\n168\n00:08:34.670 --> 00:08:37.460\nAnd if I click on that its going\nto take me to another screen.\n\n169\n00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:42.350\nWhere I can see what updates have\nbeen installed that I can uninstall.\n\n170\n00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:44.870\nNot every update you can uninstall.\n\n171\n00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:49.100\nSome updates once you've installed them,\nthere's no way to uninstall them without\n\n172\n00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:53.135\nrolling back to a previous point in\ntime before that update was installed.\n\n173\n00:08:53.135 --> 00:08:56.015\nBut these particular\nupdates support removal.\n\n174\n00:08:56.015 --> 00:08:59.385\nSo if I saw that one for flash and\nI didn't want that update for\n\n175\n00:08:59.385 --> 00:09:00.936\nsome reason I could come in here-\n&gt;&gt; Or\n\n176\n00:09:00.936 --> 00:09:04.070\nit was causing a conflict with\nanother application on my system.\n\n177\n00:09:04.070 --> 00:09:07.450\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, that driver got updated,\nand it's now causing a problem.\n\n178\n00:09:07.450 --> 00:09:09.150\nOr, like Cherokee says, a conflict.\n\n179\n00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:14.190\nI can come in here, and\nI can uninstall that update, right?\n\n180\n00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:16.280\nSo I am just going to close that for now.\n\n181\n00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:17.430\nI don't want to uninstall them.\n\n182\n00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:18.645\nI like all my updates.\n\n183\n00:09:18.645 --> 00:09:20.230\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So you can uninstall udpates.\n\n184\n00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:22.870\nYou also can jump over to\nyour recovery options.\n\n185\n00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:25.710\nIf an update was causing\nserious problems and\n\n186\n00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:29.900\nit wasn't available to uninstall,\nit didn't show up on that list,\n\n187\n00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:34.870\nthen maybe I wanna reset my PC or\ntry some other recovery method.\n\n188\n00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:37.980\nWhich we talk about in other shows, but\nI wanted to show you that link there.\n\n189\n00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:42.060\nAll right, so I'm gonna back up and\njump back out to my Windows updates.\n\n190\n00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:45.630\nLooks like it is just finished\ninstalling my cumulative update.\n\n191\n00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:48.460\nAnd it's now installing that\nWindows Defender update.\n\n192\n00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:51.010\nI'm sure this, yeah,\nyou can actually see right there.\n\n193\n00:09:51.010 --> 00:09:51.510\nWhoops.\n\n194\n00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:55.200\nAs I zoomed in, it went away.\n\n195\n00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:55.970\n&gt;&gt; It changed, there it goes.\n\n196\n00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:58.710\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\nSo the Windows Defender update finished,\n\n197\n00:09:58.710 --> 00:10:01.850\nbut it did not require a restart so\nit disappeared from my list.\n\n198\n00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:04.800\nThis cumulative update\ndoes require a restart.\n\n199\n00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:06.200\nBut it's not restarting yet.\n\n200\n00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:08.360\nIt just says, awaiting restart.\n\n201\n00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:10.830\nSo let's talk about that for a second.\n\n202\n00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:12.030\nAll right?\n\n203\n00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:14.130\nSome updates,\nespecially these cumulative updates,\n\n204\n00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:16.450\nare going to require that\nwe restart the machine.\n\n205\n00:10:16.450 --> 00:10:18.160\nIf it's modifying system files.\n\n206\n00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:20.270\nIf it's patching things\nthat are locked and\n\n207\n00:10:20.270 --> 00:10:23.070\nin use right now because\nthe operating system is running or\n\n208\n00:10:23.070 --> 00:10:26.860\na particular application or service is\nrunning, it can't update those files.\n\n209\n00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:29.830\nSo it's got everything downloaded,\nit's got everything staged, but\n\n210\n00:10:29.830 --> 00:10:34.350\nit needs a reboot, in order to finish the\nprocess or if you've updated the driver.\n\n211\n00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:36.635\nDrivers get loaded up,\nwhen you boot the system,\n\n212\n00:10:36.635 --> 00:10:40.575\ndo there are definitely going to be\nsome updates that require a restart.\n\n213\n00:10:40.575 --> 00:10:43.283\nEspecially with these cumulative updates\nbecause it's not like we're doing\n\n214\n00:10:43.283 --> 00:10:44.995\nindividual updates anymore.\n\n215\n00:10:44.995 --> 00:10:45.995\nAnd so\n\n216\n00:10:45.995 --> 00:10:51.635\none of the updates within this cumulative\nupdate is going to require a restart.\n\n217\n00:10:51.635 --> 00:10:55.260\nNow, below this, It didn't\nrestart automatically, all right.\n\n218\n00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:59.210\nI didn't see any pop up messages\ndown there in my systems array, and\n\n219\n00:10:59.210 --> 00:11:00.480\nit didn't restart.\n\n220\n00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:05.120\nAnd that's because your device is\nscheduled to restart outside active hours.\n\n221\n00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:07.260\nMy active hours are eight AM to five PM.\n\n222\n00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:12.210\nAnd one of the things, and I know\nMicrosoft heard a lot of it, was man,\n\n223\n00:11:12.210 --> 00:11:15.250\nthese updates just come down at\njust the most inopportune times,\n\n224\n00:11:15.250 --> 00:11:18.140\nthey want to restart my\nmachine automatically,\n\n225\n00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:22.320\nwell they've given us a way that\nwe can control that behavior.\n\n226\n00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:24.580\nWe can set our active hours.\n\n227\n00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:27.638\nActive hours should represent when\nyou're typically using the machine.\n\n228\n00:11:27.638 --> 00:11:31.570\nEight to five is the default,\nthat's the typical workday here in the US.\n\n229\n00:11:31.570 --> 00:11:35.250\nAnd so it's not going to\nrestart during those hours\n\n230\n00:11:35.250 --> 00:11:39.580\nunless I manually restart it which I can\nchoose to do with this restart button, or\n\n231\n00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:42.740\nI can simply reboot my\nmachine the normal method.\n\n232\n00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:45.760\nI also have the option to\nchange the active hours.\n\n233\n00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:49.400\nMaybe you are gung ho like Cherokee and\nyou actually get into work early and\n\n234\n00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:54.660\nstay late, you know change your active\nhours from seven AM to six PM or\n\n235\n00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:57.690\nyou're more like me and you're a little\nbit lazy and you roll in at about nine and\n\n236\n00:11:57.690 --> 00:11:59.250\nyou leave at about three.\n\n237\n00:11:59.250 --> 00:12:00.120\nI'm kidding.\n\n238\n00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:00.990\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n239\n00:12:00.990 --> 00:12:03.310\n&gt;&gt; You know.\n&gt;&gt; Especially about the first part too.\n\n240\n00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:07.680\n&gt;&gt; Yeah I know right, but\nmaybe you work more in the evenings,\n\n241\n00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:10.530\nyou're a second shift or\na third shift user of that PC.\n\n242\n00:12:10.530 --> 00:12:15.990\nSo, you can definitely it just says you\ncan click here Change Active Hours and\n\n243\n00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:17.030\nyou can see it says 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM.\n\n244\n00:12:17.030 --> 00:12:20.480\nBut I can simply click in there and\nchange that to nine.\n\n245\n00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:25.157\nYou don't get like you can't\nchange it at 9:07 or 10:15.\n\n246\n00:12:25.157 --> 00:12:28.730\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Those 00 I can't change.\n\n247\n00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:34.510\n&gt;&gt; So you're only picking the hour and\nthe AM or PM for that.\n\n248\n00:12:34.510 --> 00:12:36.980\nAnd I didn't want to save that change,\nso I'm going to cancel it out.\n\n249\n00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:41.150\nYou can see the max is 18 hours,\nwhich means I have a 24 hour day.\n\n250\n00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:44.520\nI got to give it at least six\nhours when it can do that reboot.\n\n251\n00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:46.140\nDid I do my math right?\n\n252\n00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:47.430\nYeah, okay.\n\n253\n00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:49.030\nDo my math correctly.\n\n254\n00:12:49.030 --> 00:12:49.610\nAll right.\nSo\n\n255\n00:12:49.610 --> 00:12:51.720\nthat's how you can change\nthose active hours.\n\n256\n00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:54.710\nI'm going to Scroll down\na little bit further here.\n\n257\n00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:57.900\nAs soon as my, yeah now its locked.\n\n258\n00:12:57.900 --> 00:12:59.330\nIt's not happy.\n\n259\n00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:00.660\nThere we go.\n\n260\n00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:02.840\nSo we talked about changing active hours.\n\n261\n00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:05.570\nGot my update settings below here.\n\n262\n00:13:05.570 --> 00:13:11.300\nIt says we will automatically and install\nupdates except on metered connection.\n\n263\n00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:12.600\nWhich is what we just saw.\n\n264\n00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:14.960\nIt automatically went out and\nstarted downloading.\n\n265\n00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:16.380\nActually I think I clicked.\n\n266\n00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:19.010\nIt checked at 8:00 this morning and\ndidn't find any.\n\n267\n00:13:19.010 --> 00:13:19.960\nNot sure why.\n\n268\n00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:21.600\nBut typically it does that.\n\n269\n00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:25.550\nYou start up the machine, it goes and\nit checks for updates, and\n\n270\n00:13:25.550 --> 00:13:29.810\nthen it starts downloading them and\ninstalling them automatically.\n\n271\n00:13:29.810 --> 00:13:32.670\nExcept if you're on a metered connection.\n\n272\n00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:34.230\nRemember, we've seen this in other shows.\n\n273\n00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:39.070\nWhen we look at our network properties,\nWe can specify a particular\n\n274\n00:13:39.070 --> 00:13:43.670\nnetwork that we connect to as being\nmetered, meaning we get get charged for\n\n275\n00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:47.310\nbandwidth or we've got a cap on\nhow much bandwidth we can use,\n\n276\n00:13:47.310 --> 00:13:49.840\nlike if you're on\na satellite type connection.\n\n277\n00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:50.840\nOr something like this.\n\n278\n00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:55.070\nAnd so you might not want those\ndownloads occurring automatically\n\n279\n00:13:55.070 --> 00:13:56.510\nwhen you're on that network.\n\n280\n00:13:56.510 --> 00:13:59.510\nYou'll wait until you get\nto work to download that.\n\n281\n00:13:59.510 --> 00:14:02.320\nOr wherever you are that has\na high speed connection.\n\n282\n00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:04.210\nOr one that you're not paying for, right?\n\n283\n00:14:04.210 --> 00:14:05.600\nThat's the key there.\n\n284\n00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:06.640\nYou can change that.\n\n285\n00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:11.020\nYou can say, go ahead and download them\nover metered connections if you want.\n\n286\n00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:13.810\nBut by default,\nif you flag a network as metered,\n\n287\n00:14:13.810 --> 00:14:17.060\nit won't automatically download/install,\nall right?\n\n288\n00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:21.690\nUnless, as you can see here,\nwe automatically\n\n289\n00:14:21.690 --> 00:14:25.500\ndownloaded only those updates required\nto keep Windows running smoothly.\n\n290\n00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:28.520\nSo there might be some updates where,\nmetered or not, it still says, hey,\n\n291\n00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:30.640\nyou're gonna need this, all right?\n\n292\n00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:32.989\nI've got my restart\noptions right below that.\n\n293\n00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:37.690\nAnd here let see if it will let me\nturn on now that I have one pending.\n\n294\n00:14:39.150 --> 00:14:43.430\nIf you come in here and you look at this\nrestart option it's gonna be set to off.\n\n295\n00:14:43.430 --> 00:14:46.950\nAnd you won't be able to change it if\nyou don't have any pending updates.\n\n296\n00:14:46.950 --> 00:14:50.250\nSo it's actually very fortuitous\nthat I've got an update pending now.\n\n297\n00:14:50.250 --> 00:14:50.775\n&gt;&gt; Nice [LAUGH].\n\n298\n00:14:50.775 --> 00:14:53.690\n&gt;&gt; Because I was gonna talk about this but\nI won't be able to show you this.\n\n299\n00:14:53.690 --> 00:14:57.590\nAll right cuz it's only available\n\n300\n00:14:57.590 --> 00:15:02.000\nif you actually have an update\ncurrently pending which I do now right?\n\n301\n00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:03.950\nAn update downloaded.\n\n302\n00:15:03.950 --> 00:15:07.840\nIt's a restart but my active hours\nare eight to five and it's currently\n\n303\n00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:11.500\n11 o'clock here in Gainesville,\nFlorida while we're shooting this.\n\n304\n00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:13.290\nSo it's pending.\n\n305\n00:15:13.290 --> 00:15:15.600\nNow that it's pending, I can come\nover here and say, you know what?\n\n306\n00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:18.860\nLet's schedule a time that I\ncan go ahead and turn this on.\n\n307\n00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:21.870\nAnd I can say I want you to,\n\n308\n00:15:21.870 --> 00:15:26.010\nI know after five,\nyou'll probably try to do this anyway.\n\n309\n00:15:26.010 --> 00:15:30.840\nBut maybe I don't want i to go and\ntell well after I get home or\n\n310\n00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:31.610\nsomething like that.\n\n311\n00:15:31.610 --> 00:15:36.247\nSo I can definitely come in here and\nset this is when I want you to restart or\n\n312\n00:15:36.247 --> 00:15:40.123\nI'm gonna bump that out unless\nI can't go out all that far but\n\n313\n00:15:40.123 --> 00:15:45.541\nI can't push that out, you know what,\nlet's not restart until Saturday, right?\n\n314\n00:15:45.541 --> 00:15:49.966\nOn a Windows 10 machine that's\nnot production, I mean,\n\n315\n00:15:49.966 --> 00:15:54.578\nit really is gonna be very\nspecific to your scenario, right?\n\n316\n00:15:54.578 --> 00:15:58.714\nIn a server where I've got production\npeople relying on those services or\n\n317\n00:15:58.714 --> 00:16:00.010\nwhat have you.\n\n318\n00:16:00.010 --> 00:16:04.080\nI really like this level of control that\nI can have of when it's gonna reboot,\n\n319\n00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:06.530\nI can plan things,\nI can send out messages.\n\n320\n00:16:06.530 --> 00:16:11.019\nOkay, the file server is gonna\nbe down at 7 PM on Tuesday,\n\n321\n00:16:11.019 --> 00:16:15.890\nso everybody can make\nplans to get around that.\n\n322\n00:16:15.890 --> 00:16:19.560\nOn a client machine, I don't know\nif I'd find this as useful for\n\n323\n00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:22.880\nme, but for you,\nit might make a lot of sense.\n\n324\n00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:26.850\nAnd again for the exam,\nunderstanding these options are there.\n\n325\n00:16:26.850 --> 00:16:29.150\nSo this is only available\nif you have one pending and\n\n326\n00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:33.260\nit just controls when it's\ngoing to automatically restart.\n\n327\n00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:36.230\nSo I might come in here and say yeah,\nyou know what, I see that update pending.\n\n328\n00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:39.945\nI'll be in bed by 11 o'clock,\nso about 11:45,\n\n329\n00:16:39.945 --> 00:16:43.640\nwhy don't you go ahead and\ndo the restart then?\n\n330\n00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:49.130\nAll right, so there's a use case where\nyou might use it on a Windows 10 machine.\n\n331\n00:16:49.130 --> 00:16:52.711\nShow more notifications, if you don't\nget tire of all those little pop-ups\n\n332\n00:16:52.711 --> 00:16:53.365\nand-\n&gt;&gt;

A lot of different variables go in.\n\n413\n00:21:10.750 --> 00:21:13.250\n&gt;&gt; Exactly,\nnow it's much more consistent, all right?\n\n414\n00:21:13.250 --> 00:21:17.830\nSo that's one of the reasons, one of the\nreasons they're kind of going with this.\n\n415\n00:21:17.830 --> 00:21:21.300\nBut, anyway, back to what we\nneed to know for the exam, so\n\n416\n00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:24.780\nI get to choose when updates\nare installed, and I've got two choices.\n\n417\n00:21:24.780 --> 00:21:27.508\nI've got Semi-Annual and\nSemi-Annual (Targeted).\n\n418\n00:21:27.508 --> 00:21:31.200\nThe Semi-Annual (Targeted),\nyou see what it reads here,\n\n419\n00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:34.840\nmeans the update is ready for\nmost people, that's the targeted.\n\n420\n00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:38.910\nAnd then Semi-Annual Channel,\nwithout the word targeted behind it,\n\n421\n00:21:38.910 --> 00:21:43.805\nmeans it's ready for widespread\nuse in organizations, all right?\n\n422\n00:21:43.805 --> 00:21:48.770\nSo the targeted is really\ngeared towards a pilot program,\n\n423\n00:21:48.770 --> 00:21:52.838\nor I don't know if I'd\nsay average consumers.\n\n424\n00:21:52.838 --> 00:21:55.553\nBut typically with the targeted,\n\n425\n00:21:55.553 --> 00:22:01.430\nI'm gonna set up a pilot group of\ncomputers within my organization.\n\n426\n00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:05.070\nAnd I'm gonna allow them to get\nthose updates before everybody else.\n\n427\n00:22:05.070 --> 00:22:08.590\nAnd that gives us a chance\nto test them before\n\n428\n00:22:08.590 --> 00:22:10.240\nthey go out to the rest of the machines.\n\n429\n00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:14.730\nSo that's really what targeted is about,\nsetting up your pilot ring.\n\n430\n00:22:14.730 --> 00:22:19.752\nWhere you deploy the updates first,\nand you test them out.\n\n431\n00:22:19.752 --> 00:22:22.730\nAll right, so if you want to live\non the edge, you choose targeted.\n\n432\n00:22:22.730 --> 00:22:26.610\nIf you want to wait until, now there's a\nlot of organizations that do that, right?\n\n433\n00:22:26.610 --> 00:22:29.194\nWe'll wait until everybody\nelse has tested it, once it's-\n\n434\n00:22:29.194 --> 00:22:30.348\n&gt;&gt;

Yeah, absolutely.\n\n503\n00:25:58.278 --> 00:26:00.085\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right, so\n\n504\n00:26:00.085 --> 00:26:03.254\nwe're going to continue on down\nthe rabbit hole of Windows updates here.\n\n505\n00:26:03.254 --> 00:26:06.230\nAt the bottom of my Advanced Options,\n\n506\n00:26:06.230 --> 00:26:11.441\nthere's a Delivery Optimization link,\nso let's click on that.\n\n507\n00:26:11.441 --> 00:26:16.863\nAnd here I get to control where\nwe're getting those updates from.\n\n508\n00:26:16.863 --> 00:26:19.303\nAnd normally,\nas I said at the beginning of the show,\n\n509\n00:26:19.303 --> 00:26:23.387\nwe're reaching out to Microsoft and we're\npulling those down from Microsoft servers.\n\n510\n00:26:23.387 --> 00:26:28.436\nBut in order to speed up the process,\nto make updates download\n\n511\n00:26:28.436 --> 00:26:33.595\na little bit faster,\nI can't allow downloads from other PCs.\n\n512\n00:26:33.595 --> 00:26:37.475\nIt was like a peer to peer or\na branch cache type scenario.\n\n513\n00:26:37.475 --> 00:26:41.623\nWhere I can, other machines that\nhave already downloaded this update,\n\n514\n00:26:41.623 --> 00:26:45.034\nI can pull some of the bits of\nthat update from them, right?\n\n515\n00:26:45.034 --> 00:26:49.367\nRather than going across the WAN,\nI can pull them right off my LAN, so\n\n516\n00:26:49.367 --> 00:26:52.670\nI can turn that on,\nallow downloads from other PCs.\n\n517\n00:26:52.670 --> 00:26:54.216\nWhich evidently maybe,\n\n518\n00:26:54.216 --> 00:26:58.419\nI can't turn on while I have\nan update pending, there it goes.\n\n519\n00:26:58.419 --> 00:27:02.436\nAgain, everything's being a little glitchy\nbecause I've got that darn update waiting,\n\n520\n00:27:02.436 --> 00:27:03.490\nso, I can turn that on.\n\n521\n00:27:03.490 --> 00:27:07.002\nNow once I turn that on,\nI've got two options down here,\n\n522\n00:27:07.002 --> 00:27:11.625\nPCs on my local network, or PCs on my\nlocal network and PCs on the Internet.\n\n523\n00:27:11.625 --> 00:27:16.632\nSo if I'm okay with pulling bits of\nan update from other machines on my LAN,\n\n524\n00:27:16.632 --> 00:27:18.701\nI can choose this option here.\n\n525\n00:27:18.701 --> 00:27:21.421\nThey won't go out and\nreach stranger's computers,\n\n526\n00:27:21.421 --> 00:27:23.482\ncomputers out on the Internet, right?\n\n527\n00:27:23.482 --> 00:27:26.454\nOnly on your local area network,\nor you can say, you know what?\n\n528\n00:27:26.454 --> 00:27:29.060\nI'm okay with you pulling them\nfrom my local area network.\n\n529\n00:27:29.060 --> 00:27:33.292\nAs well as people out there on the LAN\nthat are doing the same thing and\n\n530\n00:27:33.292 --> 00:27:36.350\nmaking their system share\nupdate information.\n\n531\n00:27:36.350 --> 00:27:39.402\nSo I can speed up the process.\n\n532\n00:27:39.402 --> 00:27:40.212\n&gt;&gt; So Mike, what do you think?\n\n533\n00:27:40.212 --> 00:27:42.188\nWhat do you do for that option?\n\n534\n00:27:42.188 --> 00:27:45.072\n&gt;&gt; If I'm in a corporate environment,\nwell, it depends,\n\n535\n00:27:45.072 --> 00:27:46.883\na lot of it depends on the scenario.\n\n536\n00:27:46.883 --> 00:27:51.102\nIf I'm using a WSUS server to\ndownload the updates from Microsoft.\n\n537\n00:27:51.102 --> 00:27:54.191\nAnd that's something we'll talk about\nlater, as well as in our server classes.\n\n538\n00:27:54.191 --> 00:27:58.948\nBut if I'm running a local update server,\nI'm already saving the LAN traffic.\n\n539\n00:27:58.948 --> 00:28:03.013\nBecause I'm pulling it down locally\nonce and then distributing from there.\n\n540\n00:28:03.013 --> 00:28:08.457\nAnd I'm fine with my PCs reaching out to\nother machines on my local network and\n\n541\n00:28:08.457 --> 00:28:10.319\ngrabbing those updates.\n\n542\n00:28:10.319 --> 00:28:13.157\nBecause it means it's less\nwork on my WSUS server,\n\n543\n00:28:13.157 --> 00:28:17.395\nif I've got a heavily routed environment,\nit might be a little bit faster.\n\n544\n00:28:17.395 --> 00:28:20.040\nIf I've got 50 computers\non this one little subnet,\n\n545\n00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:22.637\nthey can share the update\nthey've pulled from WSUS.\n\n546\n00:28:22.637 --> 00:28:27.068\nOr from Microsoft, depending on how we\nhave it set up, PCs on the Internet,\n\n547\n00:28:27.068 --> 00:28:30.481\nme personally,\nI'm sure it's perfectly safe, right?\n\n548\n00:28:30.481 --> 00:28:33.878\nAll of the bits are going\nto be digitally signed, so\n\n549\n00:28:33.878 --> 00:28:37.284\nyou're going to know that\nthey're not modified.\n\n550\n00:28:37.284 --> 00:28:42.197\nIt would, I think,\nbe very difficult for somebody to try to\n\n551\n00:28:42.197 --> 00:28:47.716\nintroduce malware or\nanything like that through there, but why?\n\n552\n00:28:47.716 --> 00:28:52.731\nIt's not so slow that it drives me crazy\ndoing it right straight from Microsoft.\n\n553\n00:28:52.731 --> 00:28:56.778\nI don't really feel the need\nto allow this extra\n\n554\n00:28:56.778 --> 00:29:01.029\nconnectivity between unknown machines,\nto me,\n\n555\n00:29:01.029 --> 00:29:05.025\nthat seems a little, it's just-\n&gt;&gt; It's just unnecessary.\n\n556\n00:29:05.025 --> 00:29:06.513\n&gt;&gt; Yes, It makes me a little tense.\n\n557\n00:29:06.513 --> 00:29:09.146\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It worries me a little bit, and\n\n558\n00:29:09.146 --> 00:29:10.471\nI'm sure it's perfectly fine,\n\n559\n00:29:10.471 --> 00:29:12.904\notherwise Microsoft wouldn't\nhave allowed this, right?\n\n560\n00:29:12.904 --> 00:29:15.180\nBut the bad guys are good,\nit's a cat and mouse game,\n\n561\n00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:16.710\nit's always going back and forth.\n\n562\n00:29:16.710 --> 00:29:20.627\nSomebody very well could figure out\na way to interfere with this process or\n\n563\n00:29:20.627 --> 00:29:21.772\nintroduce malware.\n\n564\n00:29:21.772 --> 00:29:25.889\nAnd Microsoft will figure a way to protect\nagainst it, and I'm not saying it's bad.\n\n565\n00:29:25.889 --> 00:29:30.643\nI'm not trying to insinuate that you\nshouldn't do it because you could infect\n\n566\n00:29:30.643 --> 00:29:31.660\nyour machines.\n\n567\n00:29:31.660 --> 00:29:34.884\nI'm just saying, me, personally,\nI don't like the idea of-.\n\n568\n00:29:34.884 --> 00:29:37.517\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Reaching out to stranger's machines and\n\n569\n00:29:37.517 --> 00:29:39.131\npulling those updates,\nthat's just me, all right?\n\n570\n00:29:39.131 --> 00:29:42.378\nBut that is an option there,\nand the whole idea, again, is,\n\n571\n00:29:42.378 --> 00:29:44.569\njust like when we do peer to peer, right?\n\n572\n00:29:44.569 --> 00:29:48.663\nIf I'm making a connection to multiple\nmachines to pull down this update.\n\n573\n00:29:48.663 --> 00:29:53.395\nI can get it a lot faster and maybe save\na little time, save a little bandwidth.\n\n574\n00:29:53.395 --> 00:29:56.836\nAll right, now again, we've already\nwent to Advanced Settings, right?\n\n575\n00:29:56.836 --> 00:30:01.080\nI'm going to back out, so\nwe clicked Advanced Options, and\n\n576\n00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:04.503\nthen we talked about these and\nwe scrolled down.\n\n577\n00:30:04.503 --> 00:30:09.698\nAnd we chose Delivery Optimization,\nand now at the bottom of this screen,\n\n578\n00:30:09.698 --> 00:30:12.839\nthere's another Advanced option, right?\n\n579\n00:30:12.839 --> 00:30:14.542\nSo like down that rabbit hole,\n\n580\n00:30:14.542 --> 00:30:18.875\nthese advanced options have to deal with\nthe settings we were just looking at.\n\n581\n00:30:18.875 --> 00:30:23.924\nIf I do decide to allow my PC to reach\nout to other machines on the LAN or\n\n582\n00:30:23.924 --> 00:30:25.176\neven on the WAN.\n\n583\n00:30:25.176 --> 00:30:27.881\nI can now control settings\nlike Download settings,\n\n584\n00:30:27.881 --> 00:30:31.892\nLimit how much bandwidth is used for\ndownloading updates in the background.\n\n585\n00:30:31.892 --> 00:30:35.493\nIf you start downloading updates and your\nmachine chokes, we'll come in here and\n\n586\n00:30:35.493 --> 00:30:37.435\nturn that down a little bit,\nyou know what?\n\n587\n00:30:37.435 --> 00:30:42.187\nLet's slow that down, I'm okay with it\ntaking a little longer if my PC remains\n\n588\n00:30:42.187 --> 00:30:45.649\nusable while it's downloading\nthose updates, right?\n\n589\n00:30:45.649 --> 00:30:51.011\nUpload settings, if you're going to\nallow other PCs to reach out and\n\n590\n00:30:51.011 --> 00:30:52.654\nget-\n&gt;&gt; Get the updates from you?\n\n591\n00:30:52.654 --> 00:30:54.350\n&gt;&gt; Yes, right?\n\n592\n00:30:54.350 --> 00:30:57.731\nThen here's where I can say, yeah,\nI'm okay with that, but I don't want that-\n\n593\n00:30:57.731 --> 00:30:59.256\n&gt;&gt; Just don't crash my system, [LAUGH].\n\n594\n00:30:59.256 --> 00:31:01.774\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nif you're taking up 100% of my bandwidth.\n\n595\n00:31:01.774 --> 00:31:05.317\nI can't do anything anytime somebody tries\nto download a part of an update from\n\n596\n00:31:05.317 --> 00:31:05.918\nmy machine.\n\n597\n00:31:05.918 --> 00:31:10.713\nSo again, it's just fine tuning,\nmaking sure that the update\n\n598\n00:31:10.713 --> 00:31:14.880\nprocess does not interfere\nwith your usage of your PC.\n\n599\n00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:16.647\nYou can also do a Monthly upload limit.\n\n600\n00:31:16.647 --> 00:31:19.445\nAt some point,\nmaybe my ISP caps me, right, and\n\n601\n00:31:19.445 --> 00:31:21.373\nI don't want to upload too much.\n\n602\n00:31:21.373 --> 00:31:25.440\nSo I can say, yeah, I'm okay with allowing\nother people to pull updates from me.\n\n603\n00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:30.318\nBut not more than 150 gigs a month,\nor something like that, so\n\n604\n00:31:30.318 --> 00:31:32.546\nyou can control that as well.\n\n605\n00:31:32.546 --> 00:31:37.305\nAnd then down here,\nI can see how much is currently.\n\n606\n00:31:37.305 --> 00:31:41.544\nSo my limit was set to 500, actually\nI haven't allowed anybody to download\n\n607\n00:31:41.544 --> 00:31:43.999\nupdates from the app extension, all right?\n\n608\n00:31:43.999 --> 00:31:46.871\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n609\n00:31:46.871 --> 00:31:52.992\nI'm going to back out of my Advanced\noptions for my Delivery Optimization.\n\n610\n00:31:52.992 --> 00:31:57.635\nAnd I want to take a look at this\nActivity Monitor, and it shows me, again,\n\n611\n00:31:57.635 --> 00:31:59.130\nsome more statistics.\n\n612\n00:31:59.130 --> 00:32:02.385\nYou can see I've downloaded 100%\nof my updates for Microsoft,\n\n613\n00:32:02.385 --> 00:32:04.278\nbecause I didn't turn that option on.\n\n614\n00:32:04.278 --> 00:32:07.731\nBut if you had turned it on, and you want\nto see, well, am I saving bandwidth?\n\n615\n00:32:07.731 --> 00:32:11.118\nAm I getting a good portion of\nthe these updates from the LAN, and\n\n616\n00:32:11.118 --> 00:32:14.088\nnot having to go out to the WAN and\nget it from Microsoft?\n\n617\n00:32:14.088 --> 00:32:16.296\nThis is where you could find out.\n\n618\n00:32:16.296 --> 00:32:20.072\nIf maybe the boss wants to know,\nhey, look, are we saving anything,\n\n619\n00:32:20.072 --> 00:32:22.441\nshould we enable this,\nwhat can it save us?\n\n620\n00:32:22.441 --> 00:32:28.070\nWell, here's the information you would\nneed to make an inteligent discussion,\n\n621\n00:32:28.070 --> 00:32:30.118\nwe'll zoom back out of that.\n\n622\n00:32:30.118 --> 00:32:35.385\nAnd then the vice versa upload, how many\nhave come in and pulled from my machine.\n\n623\n00:32:35.385 --> 00:32:38.116\nSo great that Microsoft\ngives me this information.\n\n624\n00:32:38.116 --> 00:32:41.511\nIt's not me just turning on a feature and\ngoing, well, I think it's working, or\n\n625\n00:32:41.511 --> 00:32:43.153\nI hope it's saving me some bandwidth.\n\n626\n00:32:43.153 --> 00:32:44.000\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n627\n00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:48.711\n&gt;&gt; I can actually get in here and\nmonitor and see what is going on.\n\n628\n00:32:48.711 --> 00:32:52.828\nAll right, Cherokee, I think that pulls\nus through most of our Advanced Settings.\n\n629\n00:32:52.828 --> 00:32:56.525\nThe only thing I haven't\ndone is actually restarted.\n\n630\n00:32:56.525 --> 00:32:59.176\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I was going to say,\nhow we doing on that?\n\n631\n00:32:59.176 --> 00:33:00.916\nWe've got a restart pending, right?\n\n632\n00:33:00.916 --> 00:33:04.580\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly, so that is about it.\n\n633\n00:33:04.580 --> 00:33:07.490\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Although right now notice it says your\n\n634\n00:33:07.490 --> 00:33:12.325\ndevice is up to date, last checked\nat 11:04, and my update's gone.\n\n635\n00:33:12.325 --> 00:33:15.674\nA little bit quirky,\nmost likely when I restart,\n\n636\n00:33:15.674 --> 00:33:18.879\nokay, let's check for\nupdates one more time.\n\n637\n00:33:18.879 --> 00:33:21.715\nWe'll wrap this show up,\nwe'll let it check.\n\n638\n00:33:21.715 --> 00:33:25.915\nSo either, yeah, I don't know what\nhappened there, the update disappeared,\n\n639\n00:33:25.915 --> 00:33:27.225\nbut it should come back.\n\n640\n00:33:27.225 --> 00:33:30.585\nBut anyway, we don't have to wait for it,\nwe know it's going to go out and tell me,\n\n641\n00:33:30.585 --> 00:33:33.039\nhey, you still need to restart for\nthat cumulative update.\n\n642\n00:33:33.039 --> 00:33:34.952\nDo you want to do so?\nAnd I'll go ahead and restart it, but\n\n643\n00:33:34.952 --> 00:33:36.965\nthat's not part of the show,\nnot part of the show.\n\n644\n00:33:36.965 --> 00:33:37.744\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n645\n00:33:37.744 --> 00:33:40.048\nthe important thing is\nthat we understand for\n\n646\n00:33:40.048 --> 00:33:43.029\nthe exam what options are available for\nWindows updates.\n\n647\n00:33:43.029 --> 00:33:46.683\nKnow that all of these settings\nare configurable through group policy.\n\n648\n00:33:46.683 --> 00:33:48.343\nSo, in a corporate environment,\n\n649\n00:33:48.343 --> 00:33:51.559\nprobably won't be setting them\nhere on a local machine like this.\n\n650\n00:33:51.559 --> 00:33:54.072\nI'll be using Active Directory and\ngroup policy to do this.\n\n651\n00:33:54.072 --> 00:33:55.750\n&gt;&gt; Awesome, Mike, well, thank you for\n\n652\n00:33:55.750 --> 00:33:59.066\ntaking the time to explain that to us\ntoday, but for now, let's sign out.\n\n653\n00:33:59.066 --> 00:34:00.439\nI've been your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n654\n00:34:00.439 --> 00:34:01.127\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n655\n00:34:01.127 --> 00:34:03.107\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITPRO.TV.\n\n656\n00:34:05.487 --> 00:34:10.240\n[MUSIC]\n\n657\n00:34:10.240 --> 00:34:13.681\n&gt;&gt;
