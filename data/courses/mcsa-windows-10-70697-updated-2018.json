You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n&gt;&gt; Welcome everyone to your\n\n6\n00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.480\nConfigure Windows Devices series.\n\n7\n00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.750\nIf you're studying for the 70-697,\nthen you're in the perfect place.\n\n8\n00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:22.900\nI'm your host, Cherokee Boose, and\nin this episode, specifically,\n\n9\n00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:27.530\nwe'll be looking at how we can support\nour Microsoft Store and cloud apps.\n\n10\n00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:30.710\nAnd with us today in studios we have Mr.\nMike Rodrick.\n\n11\n00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:31.920\nHow's it going today, Mike?\n\n12\n00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.130\nGreat, Cherokee, thanks for having me.\n\n13\n00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:37.800\nExcited as always to talk about Windows\n10, and good old Microsoft store apps,\n\n14\n00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.890\ncloud apps, all these apps that\nwe've got to support, right?\n\n15\n00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:42.390\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n16\n00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:43.208\n&gt;&gt; All right, so,\n\n17\n00:00:43.208 --> 00:00:46.140\nthat's what we're gonna take a look at.\nOne of the objectives,\n\n18\n00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.810\nthey call it, as you said,\nthe 70-697 exam.\n\n19\n00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:50.510\nThey talk about intergrating\na Microsoft account\n\n20\n00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.530\nincluding personalization settings.\n\n21\n00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.420\nAnd so that's what I wanna look at today.\n\n22\n00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.410\nAnd this is something that's\nactually kind of influx right now.\n\n23\n00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.270\nAs we're shooting these episodes,\nthings are a changing as they like to say.\n\n24\n00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.470\nI don't know where, or\n\n25\n00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.030\nwho likes to say that, but.\n&gt;&gt; Like this is the only\n\n26\n00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:09.164\nthing that's changing here-\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n\n27\n00:01:09.164 --> 00:01:09.995\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and\n\n28\n00:01:09.995 --> 00:01:14.575\nthe reason I say this is because a lot\nof the documentation that you'll go out.\n\n29\n00:01:14.575 --> 00:01:18.201\nAnd you might read as you're preparing for\nthis exam is gonna talk about\n\n30\n00:01:18.201 --> 00:01:21.414\nassociating a Microsoft account\nwith either a local account.\n\n31\n00:01:21.414 --> 00:01:25.693\nMeaning I've got a workgroup machine or\nmy home machine that I've logged\n\n32\n00:01:25.693 --> 00:01:29.190\non with a local account and\nI have a Microsoft account.\n\n33\n00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:32.630\nI can associate that Microsoft\naccount with my local account.\n\n34\n00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.560\nAnd it's gonna allow me to synchronize\nsettings, and some other things.\n\n35\n00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.120\nAnd we'll talk about that in a second.\n\n36\n00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.560\nBut then the documentation will also say\nthat you could do the same thing with\n\n37\n00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.050\na domain account.\n\n38\n00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.160\nBut what's happening is Microsoft\nis changing that a little bit.\n\n39\n00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:50.010\nAs of right now, there isn't a way\nto associate your Microsoft account\n\n40\n00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:51.140\nwith your domain account.\n\n41\n00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.640\nAnd I'll show you where\nthat setting is missing.\n\n42\n00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.650\nThere's still a group policy that it gives\nthe administrators the ability to block\n\n43\n00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:58.610\nMicrosoft accounts.\n\n44\n00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.330\nBut it seems like Microsoft might be\ndoing this a little in the background.\n\n45\n00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.680\nAnd I found an obscure blog\nthat is relatively recent, and\n\n46\n00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.950\nfrom some people at Microsoft.\n\n47\n00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.460\nThat were talking about\nhow a lot of the IT people\n\n48\n00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:12.270\nthat they'd talked to had\ncomplained about this.\n\n49\n00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.670\nThought it was a security risk,\nbeing able to synchronize settings from my\n\n50\n00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:20.160\ndomain systems with systems that\nare out of my enterprise's control.\n\n51\n00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.692\nNow with my home devices,\nlaptops, things like that.\n\n52\n00:02:23.692 --> 00:02:25.310\nAnd so maybe I mean,\n\n53\n00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.550\nI'm trying to put logic to what\nMicrosoft's doing, I obviously don't know.\n\n54\n00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:34.090\nBut the option is missing, that's the\npoint along stories that is trying to say,\n\n55\n00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:35.350\nthat option's not there.\n&gt;&gt; Well thank you for\n\n56\n00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:38.240\nbringing it to our attention, because\nI know I certainly encountered that.\n\n57\n00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:43.810\nAnd it's not, we're not saying don't study\nand don't proceed with your studies here.\n\n58\n00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.720\nIt's just, be aware of it so\nyou can evolve as well.\n\n59\n00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.170\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and so we'll talk about it.\n\n60\n00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.590\nI'll show you how it used to be, how it is\nnow, and then that way when you go into\n\n61\n00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.288\nthe exam you'll be prepared for\neither, whatever they ask you.\n\n62\n00:02:57.288 --> 00:03:00.350\nWhat we're gonna do, again a Microsoft\naccount is simply an account that I go out\n\n63\n00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:03.370\nand I create through Microsoft, it's free.\n\n64\n00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:09.980\nYou can create either a .outlook.com or\na .hotmail.com account.\n\n65\n00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:15.140\nAnd when you use a Microsoft account\nto log in to your systems or associate\n\n66\n00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:19.790\nthat with an account, it'll allow you\nto synchronize settings across devices.\n\n67\n00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.240\nBasically because you\nhave a Microsoft account\n\n68\n00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:25.090\nyou have a little slice of\nstorage out there in the cloud.\n\n69\n00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.810\nAnd we can choose to\nsynchronize certain settings.\n\n70\n00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.470\nWhat'll happen is it'll store\nthose settings up in the cloud.\n\n71\n00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.410\nAnd if I go to a different system and\n\n72\n00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:37.310\nlog on, it can retrieve those settings and\nset them on that machine as well.\n\n73\n00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:41.550\nThings like my background, my favorites,\nand a few other things, themes and things\n\n74\n00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:45.490\nlike that, can be synchronized across\nmultiple devices, which is kind of cool.\n\n75\n00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:48.790\nI like that concept,\nit works out pretty well.\n\n76\n00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:49.900\n&gt;&gt; I'm just waiting for\n\n77\n00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.630\ntheir new phone to come out, Windows\nphone, they've been talking about it for\n\n78\n00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:57.985\nyears now, and that would just be perfect.\n&gt;&gt; Don't hold you breath, right?\n\n79\n00:03:57.985 --> 00:03:59.702\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n80\n00:03:59.702 --> 00:04:00.240\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n81\n00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:02.430\nlet's take a look at my screen here and\nwe will get started.\n\n82\n00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.500\nI have a Windows 10 machine.\n\n83\n00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:09.000\nI'm currently logged on with\na local account named Mike, right?\n\n84\n00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.540\nAnd this is just a standard,\nit's the local admin.\n\n85\n00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.910\nIn fact, I think it's the first\naccount on the system.\n\n86\n00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:15.410\nBut it's nothing special.\n\n87\n00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:16.780\nIt's just a local account.\n\n88\n00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:19.810\nAnd what I'm gonna do,\nI'm gonna go to my Settings.\n\n89\n00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:21.040\nI'm going to click on Accounts.\n\n90\n00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:26.509\nUnderneath your info, that top node there,\nI can see my account,\n\n91\n00:04:26.509 --> 00:04:29.910\nMike it's a local account,\nmeaning it's stored in the local SAM file.\n\n92\n00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:32.010\nIt's not a domain account or\nanything like that.\n\n93\n00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:35.260\nAnd then down below here,\nwe can see where it says Windows is better\n\n94\n00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.430\nwhen your settings and\nfiles are automatically synced.\n\n95\n00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:39.200\nUse a Microsoft account instead.\n\n96\n00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.080\nSign in with a Microsoft account instead.\n\n97\n00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:46.730\nSo if click this link it's gonna\nopen up a dialogue box and\n\n98\n00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:49.170\nit's going to ask me for\nmy Microsoft account.\n\n99\n00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:55.633\nSo I'll type in, so what's one of\nmy accounts that I can use here.\n\n100\n00:04:55.633 --> 00:04:59.554\nWe will try that one, we will click next\nI think I remember my password for that.\n\n101\n00:05:02.732 --> 00:05:03.710\nAnd we'll sign in.\n\n102\n00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:07.870\nAnd now what it's asking me for, and\n\n103\n00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:10.070\nI should've done that a little slower,\nright?\n\n104\n00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:14.210\nFirst it asked me for my username,\nright, mikerodrick@outlook.com.\n\n105\n00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:15.870\nThat's my Microsoft account.\n\n106\n00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:18.930\nThen it asks me for the password for\nthat Microsoft account.\n\n107\n00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:22.610\nMake sure it's actually my account, that\nI own it and I have permission to use it.\n\n108\n00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:27.180\nNow it's asking me for my,\nnotice it says current Windows password.\n\n109\n00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:31.300\nTo verify that I am the owner\nof this local account as well.\n\n110\n00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:35.120\nCuz what if I had left myself logged in,\nand somebody else walked up.\n\n111\n00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:37.880\nAnd they could have gone into,\nif I had left myself logged in\n\n112\n00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:40.765\nthey could've easily opened\nsettings gone into hear your info.\n\n113\n00:05:40.765 --> 00:05:45.190\nChose to sync your Microsoft account\nused one that they know, right.\n\n114\n00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:49.250\nAnd then they could turn around and\nlog in to the system as me.\n\n115\n00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:52.550\nThat's what they're trying to prevent\nhere making sure it's actually me.\n\n116\n00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:56.100\nI got to remember my\npassword on this machine.\n\n117\n00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:58.510\nHopefully that's the right one.\n\n118\n00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:01.210\nWe shall see.\n\n119\n00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:03.120\nSo basically you have to\nput in both passwords.\n\n120\n00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:07.420\nThe password for your Microsoft account,\nand the password for your local account.\n\n121\n00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:10.480\nAnd now it's telling me use\nWindows Hello instead of your password.\n\n122\n00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:14.900\nWe've got several episodes where we deal\nwith Windows Hello, how we can use PINs or\n\n123\n00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:16.530\nbiometrics to authenticate.\n\n124\n00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:19.480\nAnd actually it didn't click on\nanything and the window went away.\n\n125\n00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:22.800\nI guess it gave up and\nsaid he must not be doing that, and\n\n126\n00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:24.330\nclosed itself.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n127\n00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:26.127\n&gt;&gt; I haven't seen that before, but\n\n128\n00:06:26.127 --> 00:06:26.838\n[SOUND] okay.\n\n129\n00:06:26.838 --> 00:06:29.020\nAnd now you will see my\ninformation has changed, right?\n\n130\n00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:32.830\nIt says mikeroderick@outlook.com\nas an administrator.\n\n131\n00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:39.550\nSo now my Microsoft account is\nassociated with my local account.\n\n132\n00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:46.705\nAnd if I log off,\nWhen I go to log back on,\n\n133\n00:06:46.705 --> 00:06:51.640\nI'll be logging on, those to, sorry,\nyou have to look at my face there twice.\n\n134\n00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:55.330\nBut you notice it's pulling all of\nmy information from that account.\n\n135\n00:06:55.330 --> 00:07:00.370\nAnd now I'm gonna be using the password\nfor my Microsoft account to log in.\n\n136\n00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:04.040\nSo it's kinda like this account has,\nit's associated with, but\n\n137\n00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:06.120\nit's almost taken over my local account.\n\n138\n00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:09.860\nI don't see that local account, I don't\nuse that local account password anymore.\n\n139\n00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:13.490\nI can if I choose to do at some point,\noops,\n\n140\n00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:17.180\ngo back into my settings and my accounts.\n\n141\n00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:21.350\nAnd I can choose sign-in\nwith local account instead.\n\n142\n00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:24.480\nSo I could remove my Microsoft\naccount from this system.\n\n143\n00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:25.240\n&gt;&gt; And sometimes,\n\n144\n00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:27.940\nI have my personal\ncomputer setup like that.\n\n145\n00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:32.020\nAnd if I don't have an internet\nconnection and you're just so\n\n146\n00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:36.840\nused to typing in your Outlook password,\nor whatever.\n\n147\n00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:38.790\nAnd if you forget about that.\n\n148\n00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:43.850\nIt will remind you to use\nthe local the local password or\n\n149\n00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:45.040\nPIN there.\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, all right,\n\n150\n00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:49.300\nnow that we are signed it with a Microsoft\naccount I can click sync your settings.\n\n151\n00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:54.103\nAnd this is where I can choose what\nsettings I want to synchronize.\n\n152\n00:07:54.103 --> 00:07:57.428\nI can turn the whole thing on or off and\nmaybe I don't want any settings to\n\n153\n00:07:57.428 --> 00:08:00.046\nsynchronize between the devices\nevery device I use is.\n\n154\n00:08:00.046 --> 00:08:02.568\nSeparate, I don't want any of\nthose settings pulling across.\n\n155\n00:08:02.568 --> 00:08:04.298\nI can turn it off altogether.\n\n156\n00:08:04.298 --> 00:08:07.598\nThe choices I have, theme,\nInternet Explorer settings,\n\n157\n00:08:07.598 --> 00:08:11.030\nbecause that is still\neverybody's favorite browser.\n\n158\n00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:13.670\nPasswords notice is turned on,\nbut it’s grayed out.\n\n159\n00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:18.640\nAnd it says passwords won't sync until\nyou verify your identity on this device.\n\n160\n00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:22.570\nAnd in order to do that I can click verify\nand it's going to do the whole thing.\n\n161\n00:08:22.570 --> 00:08:28.230\nIt will send you a text to a phone or you\ncould choose I don't have any of these.\n\n162\n00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:30.220\nMaybe choose a different option.\n\n163\n00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:33.740\nI'm not going to do that on this test\nmachine just because I don't want my\n\n164\n00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:35.400\npassword syncing with this.\n\n165\n00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:37.410\nBut just understand you have that option.\n\n166\n00:08:37.410 --> 00:08:42.220\nBut a great test question right,\nyou can sync everything except passwords\n\n167\n00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:45.340\nin order to sync passwords you\nhave to verify your account,\n\n168\n00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:48.650\nmeaning you're gonna have to get one of\nthose security codes texted to your phone.\n\n169\n00:08:48.650 --> 00:08:50.710\nEnter that code into the system so\nit knows it's you,\n\n170\n00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:54.770\nand then you can start syncing\npasswords across multiple devices.\n\n171\n00:08:54.770 --> 00:08:56.810\nLanguage preferences, ease of access,\n\n172\n00:08:56.810 --> 00:09:01.460\nand other random Windows settings\nthat Microsoft chooses to include.\n\n173\n00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:03.540\nAll right, so that's all well and\ngood on this one system.\n\n174\n00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:05.600\nBut syncing really isn't all that exciting\n\n175\n00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:06.708\nunless you get another system.\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n176\n00:09:06.708 --> 00:09:07.640\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n177\n00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:09.780\nSo, let's take a look\nat a different machine.\n\n178\n00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:12.180\nI'm going to do it a little\nbit differently here.\n\n179\n00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:16.790\nSo, this another, again, Windows 10\nlaptop, but I don't have an account.\n\n180\n00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:18.460\nI don't have a local account on this.\n\n181\n00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:23.220\nSo, what I want to do is go into accounts,\nand\n\n182\n00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:25.790\nshow you a different\nway you could do this.\n\n183\n00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:30.240\nThis is Melissa's computer, and so,\nwhat she can do it go to family and\n\n184\n00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:33.420\nother people,\nrather than create me a local account.\n\n185\n00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:35.560\nAnd then I log in with a local account.\n\n186\n00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:39.205\nAnd then I associate my Microsoft\naccount with that local account.\n\n187\n00:09:39.205 --> 00:09:42.660\nShe can simply add a Microsoft\naccount right here.\n\n188\n00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:43.920\nOther people.\n\n189\n00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:48.670\nAdd someone to this PC.\n&gt;&gt; I actually went just through\n\n190\n00:09:48.670 --> 00:09:50.190\nthis the other night with my son.\n\n191\n00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:55.230\nHe's getting to that like age where he's\nstarting to get his own accounts and such,\n\n192\n00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:59.250\nso I actually gave him a Microsoft,\nlike an online account.\n\n193\n00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:02.980\nAnd every time I had set him up before,\nI always created a local account.\n\n194\n00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:05.140\nAnd then he said okay Mom,\nso what's the password.\n\n195\n00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:07.740\nAnd I'm like,\nit's the password to your email account.\n\n196\n00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:09.760\nHe's like like I didn't even.\n\n197\n00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:10.439\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so [LAUGH]\n\n198\n00:10:10.439 --> 00:10:11.423\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, and\n\n199\n00:10:11.423 --> 00:10:14.400\nthat gives you the ability to control.\n&gt;&gt; The parental controls.\n\n200\n00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:15.385\n&gt;&gt; All kinds of things,\n\n201\n00:10:15.385 --> 00:10:17.530\nyeah with the parental controls,\nvery good.\n\n202\n00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:21.260\nAll right, so if Melissa wants to\nallow me to log into this machine,\n\n203\n00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:24.004\nshe can come in here and\nchoose to add another person.\n\n204\n00:10:24.004 --> 00:10:28.011\nmikeroderick@outlook.com, next, and\n\n205\n00:10:28.011 --> 00:10:33.205\nthat's it right,\nthat's all that she needs to know is,\n\n206\n00:10:33.205 --> 00:10:39.782\nI want to allow this Microsoft\naccount to log into this system.\n\n207\n00:10:39.782 --> 00:10:45.298\nAll right, so I'll click close on that,\nand I will switch user.\n\n208\n00:10:45.298 --> 00:10:50.120\nNotice that mikerodrick@outlook.com\nshowed up on the list,\n\n209\n00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:52.480\nthere it is,\nI type in the appropriate password.\n\n210\n00:10:56.810 --> 00:11:01.680\nAnd it's now basically creating an account\nand a profile for me on this machine so\n\n211\n00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:05.540\nit will have to go through this initial\nphase of hey welcome while we get\n\n212\n00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:09.860\nthings set up and downloads all\nthe bloatware, I mean cool apps, that\n\n213\n00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:14.460\nMicrosoft wants to put on my start menu\nand eventually it will say let's start.\n\n214\n00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:16.356\nI was kinda hoping my\ntiming would be better and\n\n215\n00:11:16.356 --> 00:11:19.446\nit would start when I said that.\n&gt;&gt; It's okay cuz I'll talk about something\n\n216\n00:11:19.446 --> 00:11:21.380\nhere, there's lots to talk about, right?\n\n217\n00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:22.950\nBut apps, right?\n\n218\n00:11:22.950 --> 00:11:25.740\nSo back in the day I know\nI spoke about this before,\n\n219\n00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:27.950\nbut, I used to call them programs.\n\n220\n00:11:27.950 --> 00:11:30.715\nFor like any kind of Microsoft\nbinary that you would install,\n\n221\n00:11:30.715 --> 00:11:31.840\nusually with a CD or DVD.\n\n222\n00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:35.340\nBut now you hear this\nterm apps all the time.\n\n223\n00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:38.220\nBut sometimes it's spelled differently.\n\n224\n00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:42.380\nAnd I think Microsoft really,\nwhen you see that capital APPS,\n\n225\n00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:46.630\nthey're really referring to like\ntheir cloud or Microsoft store apps.\n\n226\n00:11:46.630 --> 00:11:51.130\nAnd then if you have third party\nsoftware that you're installing,\n\n227\n00:11:51.130 --> 00:11:55.290\nthen you can call an application,\nso that the app etiquette, I guess?\n\n228\n00:11:55.290 --> 00:11:57.430\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, cuz your apps, or your Windows,\n\n229\n00:11:57.430 --> 00:11:59.630\nuniversal Windows platform developed apps.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n230\n00:11:59.630 --> 00:12:04.480\nVersus the old school desktop apps which\ninstall differently, and yeah, absolutely.\n\n231\n00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:05.900\nAll right, so\nhere it's saying the same thing.\n\n232\n00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:08.380\nThey really want us to use Windows Hello.\n\n233\n00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:10.100\nAnd again,\nwe've talked about this in other episodes.\n\n234\n00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:12.910\nIt's a much more secure way to\nauthenticate to your system.\n\n235\n00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:14.880\nWe really should do that.\n\n236\n00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:16.240\nI'm gonna click next.\n\n237\n00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:17.420\nIt's really confusing.\n\n238\n00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:20.380\nThis screen throws some people\noff cuz it doesn't look like\n\n239\n00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:21.710\nthere's any way to skip this.\n\n240\n00:12:21.710 --> 00:12:23.700\nIt says use Windows Hello\ninstead of your password.\n\n241\n00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:24.880\nSet up a PIN.\n\n242\n00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:26.280\nWhat if you don't want to?\n\n243\n00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:30.060\nWell, you click next to move\nto the next screen, and\n\n244\n00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:33.350\nthen just click cancel\ninstead of setting up a PIN.\n\n245\n00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:35.150\nI would recommend you do set up a PIN.\n\n246\n00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:36.210\nIt's more secure, but\n\n247\n00:12:36.210 --> 00:12:39.560\nI just wanted to show you how you\ncould get in without setting up a PIN.\n\n248\n00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:43.130\nAnd then you see down here it says,\ndid you mean to cancel?\n\n249\n00:12:43.130 --> 00:12:43.850\nMy gosh.\n\n250\n00:12:43.850 --> 00:12:44.960\nDon't cancel.\n\n251\n00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:46.580\nI'll set up a PIN later.\n\n252\n00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:51.130\nWink, wink, maybe I will, maybe I won't,\nbut that's for me to decide, Microsoft.\n\n253\n00:12:51.130 --> 00:12:54.520\nAnd I could set up my OneDrive,\nwhich would be a good idea.\n\n254\n00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:55.950\nI'll go ahead and click next.\n\n255\n00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:00.830\nAnd that'll allow it, again,\nto connect out to my OneDrive account,\n\n256\n00:13:00.830 --> 00:13:03.270\nbecause remember,\nOneDrive is also Cloud based.\n\n257\n00:13:03.270 --> 00:13:06.260\nSo now on both machines\nusing this user account,\n\n258\n00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:08.970\nI have access to that\nsame OneDrive storage.\n\n259\n00:13:08.970 --> 00:13:12.480\nSo files that I've put up there from this\ndevice, I can go to the other device and\n\n260\n00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:15.310\nlog in with that same account and\naccess those same files.\n\n261\n00:13:15.310 --> 00:13:20.060\nSo there's lots of benefits of using\na Microsoft account to log into your\n\n262\n00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:22.510\nWindows 10 machines.\n\n263\n00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:28.770\nAs I go to Settings here, now that I'm\nlogged in I can go to accounts and\n\n264\n00:13:28.770 --> 00:13:32.790\nsync my settings and\nagain you'll see the same options.\n\n265\n00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:35.750\nEverything except for passwords is set up.\n\n266\n00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:38.220\nNow let's do this.\n\n267\n00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:42.150\nLet me see if I have any, yeah,\n\n268\n00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:45.200\nit's still doing a few of those\nsetting up your profile things.\n\n269\n00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:47.720\nSo certain things are not responding.\n\n270\n00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:52.130\nYou can see File Explorer is\njust not wanting to open up.\n\n271\n00:13:52.130 --> 00:13:55.130\nLet's go back over to the first machine,\nit should be done by now.\n\n272\n00:13:55.130 --> 00:13:58.600\nAnd really all I wanted to do let me see\nif I've got a picture in here, yeah.\n\n273\n00:14:00.390 --> 00:14:01.590\nI'm gonna change my background,\n\n274\n00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:06.150\nnow again on this background we've\ngot that default Windows background.\n\n275\n00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:10.480\nOver here default Windows background,\nmachine is still not responding.\n\n276\n00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:13.910\nIt's actually setting up\nOneDrive at this point and so\n\n277\n00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:15.980\nit's making the machine a little bit busy.\n\n278\n00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:17.010\nI wanna change my background.\n\n279\n00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:20.570\nLet's set that as the desktop background.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\n\n280\n00:14:20.570 --> 00:14:24.399\nis it gonna happen in real time?\n&gt;&gt; All right, well, let's find out.\n\n281\n00:14:24.399 --> 00:14:25.579\nProbably not because this machine is so\n\n282\n00:14:25.579 --> 00:14:26.206\ndarn busy right now\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n283\n00:14:26.206 --> 00:14:27.849\n&gt;&gt; So I've got OneDrive but\n\n284\n00:14:27.849 --> 00:14:32.153\nwhat will happen is in a few minutes\nit'll actually just change my\n\n285\n00:14:32.153 --> 00:14:33.530\nbackground.\n&gt;&gt; Wow, okay.\n\n286\n00:14:33.530 --> 00:14:36.840\n&gt;&gt; I can try to speed it up by logging off\n\n287\n00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:38.400\nand logging back on.\n\n288\n00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:39.890\nAnd I probably should.\n\n289\n00:14:39.890 --> 00:14:41.820\nLet me log off of this machine as well\n\n290\n00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:47.570\nto make sure it's synchronizing those\nsettings and storing them up in the Cloud.\n\n291\n00:14:47.570 --> 00:14:52.040\nSo, back to home two which is where\nI had that standard background.\n\n292\n00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:53.240\nLet me log back in.\n\n293\n00:14:57.270 --> 00:14:59.520\nAnd see if it has taken place yet.\n\n294\n00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:01.570\nFingers crossed drum roll please.\n\n295\n00:15:01.570 --> 00:15:02.860\nAnd nothing.\n\n296\n00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:05.810\nBut I promise you it will\neventually kick over.\n\n297\n00:15:05.810 --> 00:15:10.470\nIt's not a quite instantaneous again\nbecause this account was just created and\n\n298\n00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:11.997\nit's doing a lot of\nthings in the background.\n\n299\n00:15:11.997 --> 00:15:17.970\nBut I know like I do the same thing in my\nhome with my laptop and my home desktop.\n\n300\n00:15:17.970 --> 00:15:22.140\nI can change the background on one,\nwalk over to the home machine, and\n\n301\n00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:23.960\nit's already changed over there.\n\n302\n00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:25.640\nSo it does occur pretty fast, but\n\n303\n00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:29.668\nthis is just the initial account setup\nthat's probably making it take a little\n\n304\n00:15:29.668 --> 00:15:31.090\nwhile all right.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n305\n00:15:31.090 --> 00:15:35.570\nthe background, maybe that's\nnot what everyone's cup of tea.\n\n306\n00:15:35.570 --> 00:15:37.060\nBut one of the things you had showed us,\n\n307\n00:15:37.060 --> 00:15:39.580\nMike, you showed us those\naccessibility options.\n\n308\n00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:43.600\nAnd think about how helpful that could be\nfor someone if you have someone assist and\n\n309\n00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:46.688\nhelp them getting their laptops\nconfigured a certain way, and\n\n310\n00:15:46.688 --> 00:15:49.650\nthey don't have the means\nto go through that again.\n\n311\n00:15:49.650 --> 00:15:53.180\nIndependently or something,\nand it's like updating and\n\n312\n00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:56.300\nit doesn't have that secondary machine,\ndoesn't have to be reconfigured.\n\n313\n00:15:56.300 --> 00:15:58.500\nIt's just pulling all those\nsettings from the other ones,\n\n314\n00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:01.338\nthat's really cool actually.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah absolutely, it's really nice,\n\n315\n00:16:01.338 --> 00:16:04.671\nif at all you're the one that needs those\naccessibility options where all those\n\n316\n00:16:04.671 --> 00:16:05.180\nsettings.\n\n317\n00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:07.179\nRight.\n&gt;&gt;

So\n\n349\n00:17:51.730 --> 00:17:54.090\nyou still see that segregation there.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah so\n\n350\n00:17:54.090 --> 00:17:57.490\nthis is the only way,\nyou cannot sync settings\n\n351\n00:17:57.490 --> 00:18:01.680\nfrom domain accounts with your Microsoft\naccounts at this point with Windows.\n\n352\n00:18:02.860 --> 00:18:07.130\nAll right, so let's see what is next, back\nover to that domain controller real quick,\n\n353\n00:18:07.130 --> 00:18:08.410\nif he's loaded up,\n\n354\n00:18:08.410 --> 00:18:14.000\nI did wanna show you the group policy just\nin case they would ask you on the exam.\n\n355\n00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:20.000\nSo, I am going to navigate,\nthis is again a Windows 10 exam, right?\n\n356\n00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.760\nBut they might ask you some questions,\nnot so much about how to do it, but\n\n357\n00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:24.405\nbeing familiar.\n\n358\n00:18:24.405 --> 00:18:27.390\nCuz if I have to troubleshoot,\nI have to understand what's going on.\n\n359\n00:18:27.390 --> 00:18:28.980\nAnd why isn't this working?\n\n360\n00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:33.440\nWhy can't I associate my Microsoft\naccount with my domain account?\n\n361\n00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:34.870\nNow, careful with that, right?\n\n362\n00:18:34.870 --> 00:18:40.140\nI just told you it seems like Microsoft is\nchanging it so you can't do that anymore.\n\n363\n00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:46.430\nBut the exam ref and other reference\nmaterial that you study says you can.\n\n364\n00:18:46.430 --> 00:18:49.940\nAnd they also point out how administrators\ncan block it if they want to.\n\n365\n00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:51.920\nSo, I wanna show you that option at least.\n\n366\n00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:56.713\nIf you go into computer configuration.\n\n367\n00:18:56.713 --> 00:18:59.940\nGosh where is that guy at?\n\n368\n00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:05.694\nPolicies, Windows settings,\n\n369\n00:19:05.694 --> 00:19:13.080\nsecurity settings, local policies.\n\n370\n00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:13.850\nThere it is.\n\n371\n00:19:15.340 --> 00:19:18.360\nSometimes remembering the path\nto these policies can be tricky.\n\n372\n00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:21.260\nThe computer configuration\npolicy is Windows settings,\n\n373\n00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:24.870\nsecurity settings,\nlocal policies, security options.\n\n374\n00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:27.780\nSo, buried way down in there,\nhere's the option right here.\n\n375\n00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:30.090\nBlock Microsoft accounts.\n\n376\n00:19:30.090 --> 00:19:32.800\nNow, if I double click on that\nyou'll see it's not defined.\n\n377\n00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:35.540\nSo at this point I'm not\nblocking Microsoft accounts yet\n\n378\n00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:38.590\nI cannot associate a Microsoft\naccount with my domain account.\n\n379\n00:19:38.590 --> 00:19:39.350\nThat's what I was saying.\n\n380\n00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:41.540\nMicrosoft seems to be changing things.\n\n381\n00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:45.610\nBut for the exam know if they ask you.\n&gt;&gt; Where would you go to block\n\n382\n00:19:45.610 --> 00:19:48.432\na user?\n&gt;&gt; Yes, cuz they'll give you a scenario\n\n383\n00:19:48.432 --> 00:19:52.080\nthey'll say you're an administrator for\na corporate environment.\n\n384\n00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:56.510\nYou're running 2016 servers and\nyou're running Windows 10 clients.\n\n385\n00:19:56.510 --> 00:20:00.290\nAnd your company doesn't want your\nusers using Microsoft accounts.\n\n386\n00:20:00.290 --> 00:20:01.600\nHow would you prevent that?\n\n387\n00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:02.630\nAnd you need to be able to tell and\n\n388\n00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:06.050\nthere's a group policy that you can set,\nBlock Microsoft Accounts.\n\n389\n00:20:06.050 --> 00:20:10.550\nI can turn this on and I can say,\nUsers Can't Add Microsoft Accounts.\n\n390\n00:20:10.550 --> 00:20:11.210\nRemember what I said,\n\n391\n00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:16.390\neven on domainic machine I could\ngive a Microsoft account access.\n\n392\n00:20:16.390 --> 00:20:19.230\nI can't associate it\nwith my domain account.\n\n393\n00:20:19.230 --> 00:20:22.840\nBut I can give it permission to\nlog on to that client machine.\n\n394\n00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:24.590\nThis option would prevent that.\n\n395\n00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:30.990\nI don't want somebody logging on to their\ndomain machine using Microsoft accounts.\n\n396\n00:20:30.990 --> 00:20:32.000\nSo I can choose that.\n\n397\n00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:35.660\nThey also have users can't add or\nlogin with Microsoft accounts and\n\n398\n00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:38.130\nagain, that would end up\nblocking that ability.\n\n399\n00:20:38.130 --> 00:20:41.090\nSo for the exam,\nunderstand that that option is there.\n\n400\n00:20:41.090 --> 00:20:41.922\nIn the real world,\n\n401\n00:20:41.922 --> 00:20:45.970\nunderstand that I can't associate a\nMicrosoft account with my domain account,\n\n402\n00:20:45.970 --> 00:20:49.950\nbut I can give it permission to log on and\nthat's how I would block it.\n\n403\n00:20:49.950 --> 00:20:51.230\nAll right, hopefully that's enough.\n\n404\n00:20:51.230 --> 00:20:55.920\nThat was a lot talking about a relatively\nsimple thing, but like I said,\n\n405\n00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:57.885\nit's changing and\nit gets a little bit confusing.\n\n406\n00:20:57.885 --> 00:21:00.030\nWanna make sure we're\nall on the same page.\n\n407\n00:21:00.030 --> 00:21:01.230\nAll right, next thing they call out.\n\n408\n00:21:01.230 --> 00:21:04.418\nInstall a managed software\nusing Microsoft Office 365.\n\n409\n00:21:04.418 --> 00:21:09.350\nSo that is what we are going to do next.\n\n410\n00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:16.240\nAnd Office 365, or Microsoft Office 365,\nis their cloud based Office solution.\n\n411\n00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:20.450\nAll right, it allows me to manage\na subscription based service as\n\n412\n00:21:20.450 --> 00:21:25.540\nan organization, I can provide Office\nthrough the cloud to my users.\n\n413\n00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:30.870\nBut I have to have licenses, and I have\nto assign those licenses to my users.\n\n414\n00:21:30.870 --> 00:21:35.946\nOnce I have assigned them a license,\nthey can log into portal.office.com or\n\n415\n00:21:35.946 --> 00:21:37.900\nmicrosoftonline.com.\n\n416\n00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:39.940\nAnd they can access\nthe Office applications, and\n\n417\n00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:43.820\nthey can run Cloud versions of\nthose Office applications, or\n\n418\n00:21:43.820 --> 00:21:46.960\nthey can install them\nlocally on their machine.\n\n419\n00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:49.410\nSo let's take a look at that.\n\n420\n00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:57.164\nI'm gonna navigate out\nto portal.office.com.\n\n421\n00:21:59.150 --> 00:22:01.110\nI'm gonna log in with my\n\n422\n00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:10.644\norganizations portal, office portal,\n\n423\n00:22:10.644 --> 00:22:15.620\nand from here you can actually\nsee that I already have\n\n424\n00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:19.710\na license assigned to my account and\nI show certain apps here.\n\n425\n00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:23.370\nAnd I can click on explore\nall of your apps and\n\n426\n00:22:23.370 --> 00:22:26.440\nI'll get to see all the different\napps that I can install.\n\n427\n00:22:27.630 --> 00:22:29.780\nExcel, Forms, Onedrive.\n\n428\n00:22:29.780 --> 00:22:33.980\nAnd what apps show up here really depends\non the subscription level that you have.\n\n429\n00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:37.040\nSo don't assume that you'll always\nsee these same applications.\n\n430\n00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:40.330\nDepends on what kind of license you\nhave purchased, or subscription you have\n\n431\n00:22:40.330 --> 00:22:44.290\npurchased from Microsoft.\n&gt;&gt; And sometimes even if the administrator\n\n432\n00:22:44.290 --> 00:22:47.570\ndoesn't want you to install certain apps,\nthey may only show you what\n\n433\n00:22:47.570 --> 00:22:49.670\nthey would allow to be installed, too.\n&gt;&gt; Yep, absolutely.\n\n434\n00:22:49.670 --> 00:22:53.730\nAll right, so if I click on admin,\nthis is gonna open up another page.\n\n435\n00:22:53.730 --> 00:22:57.540\nIt's my adming portal for Office 365.\n\n436\n00:22:57.540 --> 00:23:01.330\nAnd from here, I can go to Users and\nActive Users, and\n\n437\n00:23:01.330 --> 00:23:04.530\nI can see user accounts\nthat exist in my directory.\n\n438\n00:23:04.530 --> 00:23:06.910\nAnd I can see the status, right?\n\n439\n00:23:06.910 --> 00:23:08.820\nI can see some are unlicensed.\n\n440\n00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:11.677\nSome have this Enterprise Mobility and\n\n441\n00:23:11.677 --> 00:23:16.550\nSecurity as well as Office 365 for\nbusiness, right?\n\n442\n00:23:16.550 --> 00:23:19.660\nAnd again, this is more of\nthe server side of things, but\n\n443\n00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:23.960\non this exam, they might expect me to\nunderstand what could be going wrong.\n\n444\n00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:27.660\nWhy can't Daniel install any\nof the office applications,\n\n445\n00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:29.670\nbecause he's not licensed, right?\n\n446\n00:23:29.670 --> 00:23:31.420\nNow, I might not be able to do it myself.\n\n447\n00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:35.600\nI might have to get my office admin\nto go in there and give the license.\n\n448\n00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:39.200\nBut as a help desk person I would need\nto understand what the problem was and\n\n449\n00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:43.670\nhow to escalate it appropriately so\nthat the problem could get solved, right?\n\n450\n00:23:43.670 --> 00:23:49.240\nSo if I click on Dan's name, I come in\nhere and I look at product licenses.\n\n451\n00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:50.570\nAnd I can assign a license.\n\n452\n00:23:50.570 --> 00:23:54.100\nAnd actually, you know what before I\nassign the license, let's flip back over\n\n453\n00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:58.732\nhere to a client machine.\n&gt;&gt; Are we gonna check to see how\n\n454\n00:23:58.732 --> 00:24:00.247\nmany we have?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well,\n\n455\n00:24:00.247 --> 00:24:05.649\nlet's see what happens with a log-on and\nthey're not licensed, versus are, right?\n\n456\n00:24:05.649 --> 00:24:09.815\nSo, let me log off.\n\n457\n00:24:09.815 --> 00:24:13.630\nI don't know who I was logged on as,\nand now I'm gonna log on as Dan.\n\n458\n00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:18.640\nI'm logging into the main\non my domain machine.\n\n459\n00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:20.770\nI'm coming into work for the day.\n\n460\n00:24:20.770 --> 00:24:24.200\nI've been told or\nI want to install Office.\n\n461\n00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:27.190\nAnd my coworkers and\nI just go out to portal.office.com and\n\n462\n00:24:27.190 --> 00:24:28.426\nyou can install Office.\n\n463\n00:24:28.426 --> 00:24:33.661\nSo I'm just gonna launch up Edge,\nor whatever his browser choice is,\n\n464\n00:24:33.661 --> 00:24:37.135\nand we're gonna go to portal.office.com.\n\n465\n00:24:40.217 --> 00:24:41.984\nEdge is faster than both Chrome and\nFirefox.\n\n466\n00:24:41.984 --> 00:24:42.958\n&gt;&gt; That's just great.\n\n467\n00:24:42.958 --> 00:24:43.558\n&gt;&gt; Just in case.\n\n468\n00:24:43.558 --> 00:24:44.570\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n469\n00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:48.367\n&gt;&gt; All right, let's try a different\n\n470\n00:24:48.367 --> 00:24:49.140\npage here.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n471\n00:24:49.140 --> 00:24:49.763\n&gt;&gt; You see how fast it is?\n\n472\n00:24:49.763 --> 00:24:50.589\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna say, are you\n\n473\n00:24:50.589 --> 00:24:52.569\ngonna try it in a different browser, Mike?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n474\n00:24:52.569 --> 00:24:56.881\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Just kidding.\n\n475\n00:24:56.881 --> 00:24:58.385\n&gt;&gt; Here we go, all right.\n\n476\n00:24:58.385 --> 00:25:01.065\nSo Dan says, cool, I'm gonna log in.\n\n477\n00:25:01.065 --> 00:25:08.622\nDan@itprotvdemo.com You'll\ntype in his password.\n\n478\n00:25:10.376 --> 00:25:13.320\nOf course Dan is a good guy,\nand he won't save his password.\n\n479\n00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:15.352\nHe doesn't mind typing it in now and\nagain.\n\n480\n00:25:19.323 --> 00:25:21.790\nRight, and here we go.\n\n481\n00:25:21.790 --> 00:25:23.764\nHe's logged in, but he doesn't see a lot.\n\n482\n00:25:23.764 --> 00:25:27.430\nI see Store, and that's it, right?\n\n483\n00:25:27.430 --> 00:25:31.440\nAnd if I go to Install Office Apps,\nI can see Install Software.\n\n484\n00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:36.200\nAnd if I click on that,\nI get a whole lot of nothing.\n\n485\n00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:37.510\nPlease contact your Admin.\n\n486\n00:25:37.510 --> 00:25:40.430\nLooks like they haven't assigned\nyou a license, all right.\n\n487\n00:25:40.430 --> 00:25:43.490\nSo, let's assign a license.\n\n488\n00:25:43.490 --> 00:25:49.280\nOver here, I'm gonna tell him that, or\ntell Office, that Dan logs in from the US.\n\n489\n00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:50.360\nAnd you need to choose a reason.\n\n490\n00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:52.100\nIt will actually tell you over here,\n\n491\n00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:55.090\nsome products are different\nbased on your region.\n\n492\n00:25:55.090 --> 00:25:59.252\nSo it helps to tell them what region\nyour user, normally logs in from.\n\n493\n00:25:59.252 --> 00:26:02.610\nHe might travel and go to Europe for\nmeetings and things like that.\n\n494\n00:26:02.610 --> 00:26:05.086\nBut primarily he logs in in the US.\n\n495\n00:26:05.086 --> 00:26:09.147\nAnd I'm gonna give him Office 365\nBusiness, and once I turn that on,\n\n496\n00:26:09.147 --> 00:26:11.889\nyou'll see I have a few\ndifferent options here.\n\n497\n00:26:11.889 --> 00:26:18.510\nOffice 365, OneDrive, Office Online,\nSway, Forms, but this will change, right?\n\n498\n00:26:18.510 --> 00:26:22.350\nDepending on the level of subscription\nthat your organization has,\n\n499\n00:26:22.350 --> 00:26:24.340\nyou might see different options here.\n\n500\n00:26:24.340 --> 00:26:27.260\nI'm gonna go ahead and give him\nthe enterprise mobility and security.\n\n501\n00:26:27.260 --> 00:26:30.990\nThat's really a different episode, but\nwhile I'm here I will as well do that.\n\n502\n00:26:30.990 --> 00:26:37.890\nAnd I will go ahead and click save,\nand then close, and I'll close that.\n\n503\n00:26:37.890 --> 00:26:43.311\nAll right, now I'll back up the Dan's\nmachine [SOUND] that is the wrong machine.\n\n504\n00:26:43.311 --> 00:26:45.390\nGo back over to Dan's machine.\n\n505\n00:26:45.390 --> 00:26:47.680\nAnd Daniel was gonna click back.\n\n506\n00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:49.463\nSo he called the hub desk and\nsaid, hey, what's the deal?\n\n507\n00:26:49.463 --> 00:26:51.280\nI don't have any Office applications.\n\n508\n00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:53.190\nWhy can't I Install Office?\n\n509\n00:26:53.190 --> 00:26:54.850\nAnd they escalate it up.\n\n510\n00:26:54.850 --> 00:26:57.740\nThe admin goes and assigns Dan a license.\n\n511\n00:26:57.740 --> 00:27:02.590\nSo Dan comes back in here, and\ngoes back out to Office 365.\n\n512\n00:27:02.590 --> 00:27:06.980\nAnd then he's going to and\nit doesn't look like it has kicked in yet.\n\n513\n00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:08.070\n&gt;&gt; That's what I was going to ask.\n\n514\n00:27:08.070 --> 00:27:12.110\nBecause sometimes I've dealt with Cloud\nservices and it does take a little minute.\n\n515\n00:27:12.110 --> 00:27:16.860\nSo if Dan's on the phone you might\nhave some awkward silence there.\n\n516\n00:27:16.860 --> 00:27:18.500\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n517\n00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:22.763\nLet's try relaunching that browser and\nthen going back in,\n\n518\n00:27:22.763 --> 00:27:24.608\nhave it reauthenticate.\n\n519\n00:27:24.608 --> 00:27:25.984\nGo back to portal.office.com.\n\n520\n00:27:28.183 --> 00:27:33.080\nEnter in my password, and\nthat's not the right password for Daniel.\n\n521\n00:27:34.410 --> 00:27:35.548\nToo many different accounts in my head.\n&gt;&gt; As you said,\n\n522\n00:27:35.548 --> 00:27:37.034\nhow do you remember all of this?\n&gt;&gt; I do.\n\n523\n00:27:37.034 --> 00:27:37.684\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n524\n00:27:37.684 --> 00:27:39.037\n&gt;&gt; And they're not all the same,\n\n525\n00:27:39.037 --> 00:27:39.730\nI promise.\n\n526\n00:27:39.730 --> 00:27:41.355\nOkay, some of them are.\n\n527\n00:27:41.355 --> 00:27:46.856\nAnd it doesn't look like it has\nkicked in just yet, no, it has not.\n\n528\n00:27:46.856 --> 00:27:50.202\nAll right, probably what we will have to\ndo, I know we are getting short of time.\n\n529\n00:27:50.202 --> 00:27:53.270\nAnyway, Cherokee we'll give\nthat a few minutes to bake but\n\n530\n00:27:53.270 --> 00:27:58.290\nit is a good example if you guys\nare working with this troubleshooting and\n\n531\n00:27:58.290 --> 00:28:01.100\nyour admin calls and says,\nyep, I've updated it.\n\n532\n00:28:01.100 --> 00:28:02.730\nDaniel now has a license.\n\n533\n00:28:02.730 --> 00:28:06.060\nSo you tell Daniel to log in and try it\nout, and he says, nope, it hasn't changed.\n\n534\n00:28:06.060 --> 00:28:09.110\nMicrosoft will tell you,\ngive it ten minutes and come back.\n\n535\n00:28:09.110 --> 00:28:13.165\nCuz it takes a minute for everything to\nreplicate across there data centers for\n\n536\n00:28:13.165 --> 00:28:14.415\nall of that to kick in.\n\n537\n00:28:14.415 --> 00:28:17.845\nSo we will stop here, and\ncome back maybe with another part?\n\n538\n00:28:17.845 --> 00:28:19.440\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a great actual example.\n\n539\n00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:22.445\nBecause in real life we're not just\n\n540\n00:28:22.445 --> 00:28:24.895\nhaphazardly handing out\nall those licenses.\n\n541\n00:28:24.895 --> 00:28:26.435\nThat you guys really may encounter this.\n\n542\n00:28:26.435 --> 00:28:28.945\nGreat demo for that Mike.\n\n543\n00:28:28.945 --> 00:28:30.145\nAnd thank you so much for joining us.\n\n544\n00:28:30.145 --> 00:28:31.405\nBut for now let's sign out.\n\n545\n00:28:31.405 --> 00:28:33.665\nI've been your host, Cherokee Boose.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n546\n00:28:33.665 --> 00:28:36.762\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITVProTV.\n\n547\n00:28:36.762 --> 00:28:42.658\n[MUSIC]\n\n548\n00:28:42.658 --> 00:28:45.762\n&gt;&gt;
